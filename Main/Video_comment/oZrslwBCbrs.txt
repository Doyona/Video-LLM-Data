si se parece a sanji
Can i see jaiden pls 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I’m scared to think what would happen if you and Jaden went to a anime and gaming convention
I haven’t finished the full video, but I don’t think you mentioned Jaden once
11:13 what happened
is no one gonna talk about what he saw at a 7/11
24:35 “Jacob knows me so well I haven’t even mentioned this that much” it sounds like you are the best friend anyone would want
In all fairness, if Sanji was real, he'd look like you :3
1:32 I know im 2 years late to the video to be commenting on it but... why is Australia at the top of the fast food chain tierlist 😭 Iv only experienced Thailand's Maccas menu (THEY DID PINEAPPLE PIES OMG IT WAS REALLY GOOD I LOVE PINEAPPLE especially when baked and cooked) but Im kinda dying to know what puts Aus at the very top here we really dont have anything stand out menu wise or even stand out unique fast food chains that other places dont have only one i can think of is Red Rooster and like some ppl think its mostly money laundering bc not that many ppl eat there (the chicken is expensive and grocery stores literally sell cooked chickens still hot for cheaper) I actually just googled fast food chains here and a lot of these i don't consider fast food at all Pancake parlor is AMAZING but its not fast food??? thats a full restaurant sit down and eat I dont even think they do take away + food is way too good to fall under fast food Its a chain but just a restaurant chain nothin fast food about it
I WANT TO GO TO JAPAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNN BUT I'M  POOR
i subscribed so you can buy more plushies
13:48 huh???
Aweeee~! This is Dang Cool~!!! i wish i could do this my friends and family!❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍💯💫🗾👍
24:49 I love how all of these people refer to their pokemon plushes
ABSOL YOU NERD!
Idk I think you didn't spend enough!!!
15:31 is that cdawgva
Omg this was the first video of his I see and I understand now why Jaiden loves and praises him sm.
1:30 YES IRELAND IS A TIER WE STAY WINNING
HAHAHA I CALL JAPANESE XD これわにほんごです！ はい、　１：５７AMです。。。 im tired.  .  .
Hi

The last part always makes me cry…🥹
2:48 GET THE DEMON SLAYER ON - NOOOOOO
7:42 Does anyone know the song playing here?
1:30 dude same my anthropology special interest is so *SCREAM*
Um... I wanna talk about 0:55 real quick.
21:45 can someone tell me who this is *cough*
i have never discovered this channel before but the bit about you being happy, i sobbed.
0:34 god it feels weird watching a YouTuber be in the exact same place I went to like 4 months later
Oh, you mean the little boy Saul from your friends with you?
2:44 Well that escalated quickly
2:51  TOKITO MUICHIRO SPOTTED.

心が暖まる良い動画でした！日本に来てくれてありがとう！
Your vid got 5 million views and Jaiden got 20 million views
Jaiden's video is way better. Not only did she include Jacob in her video, but she also complimented him at the end. Jacob's video is just all about himself. So selfish
11:14 😭
Whats crazy is someone allied you Sanji 😂
Didn’t they ask Jaiden but she wanted to bring you ?
11:14 Dang! With the hand grab and everything! 😁
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU SPENT
Came here right from jaden animations video lol😊
11:14
I know how it feels to blow my money on anime stuff
10:42 the kid may of been right…
i didn't know about horrizons was out yet....
wait there's only 1 bed in the hotel room where did jaiden sleep...... 1:17
IM GOING THIS DECEMBER AND NOW I KNOW WHAT IM DOING
W man for giving so much to his friends you spent so much money on them and not on your self
Who is the vampire girl that got a gift box?
Under 1323737346366446644660000000 eons gang

Hell yeah pointcrow!

i wanna be a youtuber for this lol
You really look like sanji for real
Wait, what was that image before day 5???????
2:45 to WHAT
this is quite a different perspective to Jaiden's vid on this but is as amazing! Moreover giving so many things to so many people is peak, so niceeee.
I watched Jadens video and she was OBSESSED with checoba-
1:30 Australia is at the tooooooooooop 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
...with jaiden...
I thought jaiden was there
11:14 that looks like the best gyutan u had on the trip (gyutan is a japenes dish made out of beef tung)
Honestly this stuff besides the difficult life of a youtuber, makes it worth it
Japan ❤ Pokemon
11:14 GAY-
Dude I was born in 2014
I'm glad that you enjoyed your self
I’m subscribed both to your friend and me and you
Онегинская строфа — это особая стихотворная форма, созданная А. С. Пушкиным в романе «Евгений Онегин». Она состоит из 14 строк, написанных ямбом тетраметром. В ней сочетаются разные виды рифмовки: перекрёстная (abab), смежная (ccdd), опоясывающая (effe) и парная (gg). Таким образом, строфа объединяет в себе разнообразные поэтические приёмы и звучит как завершённая маленькая поэма. Эта форма придаёт произведению особую гармонию и музыкальность, а также подчёркивает мастерство Пушкина в создании уникального художественного стиля.
I clicked on an Alpharad video for the first time and was jumpscared by Jacobs irl face
11:14 alpharad, what is this.
I’m happy that you told us these little details about your personal life but it might help if you see a therapist
Why is my country at the very top!? I go there every week and it’s not the best 😂😂 (Australia)!?
Thank you so much Alpharad for making this video. You are such a wholesome person ❤︎🥹  I’m the same way, I haven’t gone back to Japan since 2011 since my uncle passed. It’s been 14 years now, I’ve just been grinding away. I hope maybe next year I can go back to see my family again.  Also I’d nerd out so hard on Pikmin and Pokemon merch hahaha ✨👏🤣
wth are u doin in karaoke 🔥
Can you blame the kid? First video of you I’ve ever seen, and sanji was also my first thought 😂😂
Australian McDonald’s is made life a life. I live in Australia. I don’t know what the other McDonald’s like maybe they’re shit well I know it’s just McDonald’s and it’s pretty good food
Are you and Jaiden dating?
Nice kiss alpha rad
9:37 we just got a sneak peek at jaidens very obvious adhd symptoms 😃👍
1:33 did not expect Sweden to be S because as a Swed it’s like an A 😂 Spain is S tier their McDonald’s was yummy
I bet 20 dolars Jaiden drew the videos art
Hello sanji
11:14 wow! that’s one frame..
Im nine minutes into this video and i just wanna know one thing.....IS JAIDEN MENTIONED?! LIKE NOT ONLY SHOWN JUST MENTIONED??!!!!  Edit: no i just saw jaiden being mentioned i love how he mentions her for the first time while she develops a new obsession 😅
Was it with jaiden?
5:26 STD?
5:43 CHIIKAWA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is that an hatsune miku car?!?!?!?!? 17:19
alpharad what are you doing at 11:14 of your video 🤨🤨🤨
WHO WERE YOU MAKING OUT WITH
I love this so much, the way this video became my hyper focus the second it started, after finding clips of Jaiden’s animated videos, I love this so much. One day I plan to visit Japan (and probably cry about not buying enough the entire time, and probably spend all my money on my friends.
man I didn't think jaiden would ,make a longer video than alpharad
No kidding, that guy's a Tetris god. It's both Jaiden's and Alpha's bags combined, and there are around 10 to 15 bags, including suitcases. So, how long has he been playing Tetris for?
15:29 OHARA I LOVE HIM!!!!!
Aw the ending, I mean what a sweetheart ❤
You're sooopooooooo lucky I love Pokémon and I love Japan please bring me I'll do anything please please 🥺🥺🥺 I live in the UK Bristol plz please 🥺
11:14
I also feel like ''when can I go back to japan!''
7:00  is that jaiden?
Yoooooo yoooooo yoooooooooooooooo!!!!!!! They have friggin splatoon!!!!!!!!! Guuuuunnzzszzszs!!!! That settles it I already admire Japanese culture and their creations (cough Nintendo and pokemon) but now I have to go.
YOKOHAMA?? bsd...mentioned...? okay sorry
11:14 well damn sir
11:44 if you go frame by frame using < and > you'll see something amazing
Bruh
15:04 wolfeyvgc lest go
11:14
WHY IS POKÉMON HERE
This video is basically, "Wild Shop Appears, You used Attack move "Yeet Money", It's Super Effective"
11:14 pause and tap the button
Sweet video. My first of yours. I found you through Jaiden. Are you to TOGETHER??? LOL
just noticed the effort to keep JaidenAnimations face out the video and is obvious a friend should do that but I feel it should be mentioned and praised.
art avatar: boy band, real life: Hello daddy😶🤭
Was you in japan whit jaiden?
13:27 lol
hey, aren’t you surprised that you’re in Japanese and you’re blonde?
2:42 from groceries to WHAT?!?!?
I know this video has been out for almost two years but I still love going back to it, the first time I watched it the ending had me in tears and I feel the same way now. It’s a really fun video that prefer over Jaiden’s, it’s so much more touching and real I adore it!!
did you go with Jaiden
Alpharad, I have the same dream. Go to Japan to see Pokemon, Pokemon if you see this i'm gonna be very open here. You are the inspiration that keeps me going! <3
i know what Jaiden face fa la la la  now i know where you both live fa la la la la.                          (for real)
Persona 5 music hit me like an aketchi special
24:10 "inkling girl splatoon statue"
I love that you to go to Japan with your best friend. You remind me of myself, so much in fact you and Jaiden inspire me on wanting to go to Japan one day
Lisent im really touched IM not one of your friend but see that how good friend you are im jealous of your friend that they have suck a good lovely friend I wish we Was i was born when you and be friends with you I think your friends love you more Than they show
Seeing the end part of the “santa” or giving part brings me tears, and it just makes me think about my friends and appreciate them
Does anybody else wanna be a animator in this time like Jacob and Jaiden bcs THEYRE SO AWESOMEEEEE and i would love to be as talented and happy as them😊😊😊 This vid made me so happyyyy
My favorite video of all time
Tbh you kinda look like Robertidk lol
11:14 YALL SAW THTAT RIGHT??
Nooooo Swedish McDonalds isn’t that goooood…. (As a Swedish/Moroccan person Swedish McDonalds is not that great and YOU SHOULD 100% TRY MOROCCAN MCDONALDS!!!!!!!!)
11:14 bromance 😂
I came here after jaidens video
7:01 she's so happy to have found this . Also I would spend an unreasonable amount of money too, dont worry .
Jacob is the dream friend, spending more than $10,000 on all your friends on a trip to one of the nicest countries flown out by your childhood gaming company is so amazing.
I just noticed in the thumbnail that zoro was getting lost
OMG, POCHITA?? 5:20
So we are all going to ignore that he kisses another dude  😂
i live in japan
11:14 I will say no more
Yay
Actually you're like the friend someone should aspire to be, someone who listens and think of their friends, specifically those that inspire you to be better each day. I love and revisit this video each time just to see the last part
came here right after jaidens video
Omg  you were there with Jaiden animaitions
Pokémon partner you mean Jaden
The ohara camio is unexpected 15:34
10:16 MIDORIYA
Bro I di
I love how everyone refers to their favorite pokemon as "baby" no matter how anti-baby they are.
11:13 why is he kissing pchal?
Chicawa😊
Jayden❤
The one piece Is real
Macdonald is too good in canada
23:09 is that the guy from Queens of the stone age(
welll yea but 7-11 stinks (like smells bad when you enter)
Try mcdonalds in POLAND!really good!
Help what song is in the background 7:59
This guy should be rated everyone 10 and up right
My sister and father have been to Japan, and yeah, my father really loved the Seven Elevens.
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD HIDE A PHOTO OF YOU KISSING A ### SHAME ON YOU JACOB SHAME
8:22. Omg! Is that Saramoon?!
11:14 is crazy
The one friend thats obsessed with miku ‘MORE MIKU???’
ALOLAN VULPIX AAHH SNOWY
reminder to those who don't use yen or USD that you can convert the prices into your currency and be equally as jaw dropped!
Got me😂😂😂 11:04
I am convinced this whole trip was designed to assassinate Jacob Alpharad's bank account.
what man did you kiss
🤌
11:14 <3
2:45 Not me looking at the mha pack
2:46 we’re just going to skip over that
2:45 why doesm 7-11 have *that*
Out of pocket comment but as a Mexican seeing Mexican chainfood in A Tier feels so wrong  Maybe I'm just too mean on the local cuisine (or maybe specifically my city is God awful)
I SAW EVERY FRAME OF EVERY SHADE OF FVCKED UP SIR. EVERY. FRAME.
5:41 Chiwawa foreshadowing
2:44 excuse me WHAT
11:14 JACOB I SAW THAT
When u die can I have all the merch plsss
That is so true because I visited Japan. 7 eleven 😂🎉
Talk about jaiden bro
Lol jaidens new favorite character:D
I wish I was one of ur friends 😊❤they got soooo many gifts!!🎁
Your credit card is on fire and destroyed
8:03 it's a lot better than I could ever make
i saw that
It's my dream to move to Japan and having a hard childhood and dealing with social anxiety and loneliness looking at this video shows it's possible from someone I looked up to as a kid making stupid not series vids an pokemon super cuts I loved them keep it up man 💙
😭 11:15
lmao sanji-san
Tell the truth you went with jaidenanimations!
i need more eevee merch :<
This truly is one of the most comforting videos I’ve ever seen. Jacob I’m happy for everything you’ve done to get to this point in your career. Seeing the joy you brought your friends with those gifts brings a smile to my face and I wish you the best in life.
when you were talking about 7-eleven you said, "to po-" i said ok then yell TO WHAT???!!!!!!!
Me after the first minute: Where’s Jaiden!?!
Zzzzzzzzz snoring
7eleven also has yummy smoothies I like berries and yogurt smoothies
I know we all saw that one scene 😁iykyk  Edit: This video was so wholesome it rlly lifted my mood
Why did it take him 10 minutes to mention Jaiden 😢
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
5:08 what a cinematic universe break down of fictional realities that we all love and adore.
Your jacobbbbbb
san jisan
This was first recommended after I watched Jaiden's video 🙂
I'm actually saving up to go to Japan with my family (5 people) and the hotel ^^
I think u forgot jaden
Any one 2025
SANJI SAN
Did anybody else hear a similar story from Jaden animations or was it just me?
🥭
Rewatching this made me sob. The burnout is real with throwing yourself into things taking off, more creators are opening up about this and it's incredible to see more behind the scenes. It's nice to see the more "real" side of content creation. You have some incredible content and just seem so vibrant and happy. Thank you for being an safe space and escape from current events in the world and all the shit being thrown at everyone from all angles.
11:14 I have no words seriously I could not think of anything to write here anyway you have the big gay
5:12 no need… we understand
Zoro is lost in the thumbnail 💀
no jaiden?
Well from all the exclusive murch that he bought was it really a net loss
5:20 wait I have had that exact dragonair for years my mom got it off amazon lol
I know your name Jacob
That santa moment made me want to cry! Im so so happy for you and all your friends man ❤😊!
Failboat lets goooooooo
Did anyone else see zoro going the opposite way of the others
im watching this nearly 2 years later after watching Jaiden's video... the ending in giving the gifts to your friends really made me emotional. i really want to do something like this too, so i hope one day i'll have the privilege and opportunity to ball out like this.
This video is good and all, but I liked how in jaidens.... She mentioned you like every other 5 mins even if it was just a small mention but like.... We've only seen small glimpses of her during the video but no mention.... Why?
yokohama!? like bungo stray dogs!?!?!
As jealous as I am, my wallet would hate me and I'm too young
What about Jaiden
Ohhhhhh he’s gay. It makes more sense now.
Tell Jaiden I said hi
That looks like a great event.
20:48 I wouldn't know brother but congrats to you mate
I feel like I'm watching a Leon and Claire A and B scenario video after watching Jaiden's
11:14 …        WHAT
jaiden got evry miku
jaiden!!!!!! omg jaiden
jeiden

Did anyone realized that he kissed someone...?
Heyy, Aussie Maccas beat Japan's Maccas!

11:14 happy June y’all
I genuinely hope that I am successful enough one day to do all this for my friends! ❤❤
WHERES JAIDEN?
I came here from Jaiden's video and I gotta say. I aspire to be the kind of friend Jacob is. Everyone he gifted boxes to were so happy and clearly impressed by how well Jacob knows them. Everybody deserves a friend like Jacob.
11:14 he kissed yan ?! 🤩
7:46 why does Jacob look like  his emoji that was pointing before (I know it’s supposed to look like him but still)
luckyyyyy also ONE PIECE!
11:14 YO THE ALPHACHAL KISS??
Zoro is even lost in the thumbnail 🤦
I am new to all these animations channels thing but u people show me what i want to be I'm 17 now but when i start my college I want to start a channel i guess plus ur video truly touched my heart this is the first time i write a comment in a language different than my main mother language am Arabic actually and that's it thanks from the heart and bye from another guy who liked your content
“From groceries to P**n.” Bro went down the wrong rabbit hole 💀💀😭🙏😂🤣

3:05 that was cool, i wanna learn to do that 😭🥀
Did you meat jayden
Are you okay?
11:14 we saw that Jacob.
i watched jaiden's video and yours and they are soooo similar
uhhhh 11:14
I watch this in the background of my 9-5 job
I just realized that alpharad is basically gojo
Why he dosent mentions Jaiden at all
Sanji-san!
Oh- 11:14 ( not to be homophobic)
11:14 OH MY GOD
Ur hair style sort of looks like RobertIDK
11:14 EXUSE ME
This is my first video watching on this channel and I am literally crying <3 You are an amazing person! You have definitly a new fan from Germany!
i love how every single one of them at the end had a favorite pokemon they were excited about! it really goes to show that every pokemon is someone’s favorite
5:31 being in debt will always be worth a dragonair or dratini
11:14 damn
11:15
11:14 MY SHIP HAS SAILED!!!!!!
11:14 WAS THAT JAIDEN ?
dont care kecleon exists new mission unlocked-
Hi Sanji  :D
lol my birthday is October 16th
This video is first to talk about japan and jaiden is the second  one
Came from jaiden:3
Is Aussie Mc Donalds that good?
15:29 is that manu from ohara!!!
11:10
Bro, spent $4,562.55
Ngl this might be my favorite video on all of YouTube. The merch, monologue and finally the gifts at the end and how happy everybody was
11:14 woahh you gay 😂😅
Nobody talking about what happend in minute 11:14 is crazy to me
WHERES JAIDEN PLS COME ON WHY SHE FEATURED YOU IN HERS  Still amazing video good job
Why are you talking about it like jadien wasn’t even there…🤨??
14:46 I know I’m like 2 years late but context?
Giving gifts to your friends is so wholesome 🐢❤️
Damn I wanna go back to japan
I finished the Teal Mask DLC 100 percent including the pooedex in just 3 days
I came from Jaiden’s video. This popped up on my home page and I was like “huh, this looks like Jacob from Jaiden’s video!”
Nah Ima go to Japan just for the shanks jacket
Where is Jaden?
He has the biggest heart ever known to mankind. ❤
Hey, I haven’t watched the whole video yet but why didn’t you mention Jaden?
11:14 *insert Leonardo Dicaprio pointing meme
Seeing all the stuff live like this, and seeing it from both perspectives is kinda interesting, Glad y'all had fun with this lol. Wasn't expecting to shed tears througout the second half of this video but your journey has been incredible man, i know i'm late to the party but it's incredible seeing how much of an impact your friends make on you and you on them. Keep trucking on man
8:26 I’ve never been to japan however I do have the Pikmin 4 yellow Pikmin hoodie from this store from a cousin who went there!
I came to japen too😅😅😅
tell me about the trains
It was fun video to watch but it’s kinda sad that you thought the kid say something bad about being foreigner. Most Japanese do not hate foreigners just don’t believe all those stories/propagadna Chinese netizens are spreading.  They pick up the rare case (like no-foreigner sign which rarely exist, only around American army base where locals have conflict with soldiers) and exaggerate it like whole nation is like that. I don’t know how many times I’ve seen fictional “my experience in Japan” stories on reddit with plot holes.  Don’t be brainwashed by them.
That’s going to be me when I go to Japan
1:31 pls add hong kong as s tier please
1:31 not me eating Canadian McDonalds while watching this😭
My mom saw you in japan
Did anybody notice near the end of day 4 there's the part that you can pause on were it shows Jacob kissing someone 🤔😅🥴🤨
11:13 Must've been the wind...
JACOB YOU HAVE THE SAME NAME AS MEEEE I love your content 🤙🗣️
Zoro in the thumbnail
I SAW MHA IM SOLD
15:04 HI WOLFE!!!
Why did you keep buying suitcases when you couldve shipped all the stuff back for much cheaper? 😅
11:14 dude what
Did I just saw real breaking nate
Astro boy 😱
Where is jaiden
11:14 wat 11:14 11:14
*heads to Japan*  Wallet: *spills out money*
The fact that he didn't mention the addiction of chicuwa of Jaiden
8:04 no no no,yours is good enough,no worries
Where is Jaden?
Pokémon how are you? 😅
11:14  mind giving some context?
SAN ji has a brown swirl on his chin and blond hair Jacob has brown beard and blond hair
Excuse me 11:14
WELP bro might be mides
you remind me of Jacob for Jaiden animations
Pokémon you did it you almost made him go bankrupt
Pokemon made money off of Jacob and Jaiden
Genuinely, that kid calling you "Sanji-san" is incredibly wholesome. He probably went back to his friends and told them he actually saw a character from One Piece. Or in another way.... You proved to him that One Piece is real.
tbh, i liked jaiden's version waaaaay more
I strive to be as generous as Jacob. My bank account is too small for the things I want to give the people I love the most. I will always pay back the love and friendship I’ve earned in the form of meaningful gifts that just make people smile.
11:14 ummmmm what
Came here from Jaiden 👇
You: taking a picture of Jaden Jaden: Miku Chiikawaaaa one piece Pikachu
9:40 just look at how happy she is I love it  (⁠✷⁠‿⁠✷⁠) I just want to met her in real life!!!!!!!
11:14 kiss
pokemon+hatsune miku= project VOLTAGE
For the people asking for the theme that played at 19:45, it's from Xenoblade Chronicles called "Once We Part Ways"
The gift unwrapping is awesome
I’m so excited, I’m going to Japan tommorow!
yo whats the song that starts at 9:58??
AUSTRALIA FOR THE 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
"This place had charms, shirts, cups, Power-!"  In regards to that last one.... *Bang*
9:41 glad to see you captured the historic moment that Jaiden became hyper fixated on Chiikawa.
"My jobs kinda.. odd" yeah but its fun
Oh THATS when Chikawa kidnapped Jaiden huh
Coming from jaiden's video really changed my perspective on Jacob. Now, instead of the funny dude, Jacob the youtuber seems softer in my eyes. Does that make sense?  Edit: i just watched the rest of the video. My god they were so happy.
2014 was wene i was born
Showering my friends with Gifts is exactly how I would spend an absurd amount of wealth. Good show dude
11:14 your welcome 🤗
And where is Jaden?
11:14 the amount of times I've paused that moment is crazy.
I love how he doesn’t mention Jayden even once yet Jayden mentioned him every three minutes
Good that Mexico is on a on his tear list
Hold up are you telling me that the Pokémon world championship series finale was on the same day that 1072 air life😮😮😮😮😮
What is that modded game?
Does anyone know where to get the shirt he’s wearing?
11:14 .... must have been the wind lmao
Wait Sweden has GOOD MacDonalds?? Ew thats like the worst Burger fast food joint and I wish it never came here.
you managed to find happiness in balance with work...something I've dreaded wouldn't be possible since i began to understand what adult life would mean for me...thank you for showing me it was possible (this is an overly sappy was of saying it, but I'm tired and might have double dosed on my meds on accident, so ima be sappy.) (double dosing isn't dangerous with the meds i take)
2:46 okay,whats the location of that 7-eleven
15:15 you must tell me where you got your shirt from. Its the prettiest thing ever and I need it
2:50 I see demon slayer, hand it all over
bro, just say you payed for your flight and didn't buy anything
7:19 Heyyyy i got the same Substitute plush
5:45 I need that figurine
Me
Did you hit tho?
I love that little kid called you Sanji because you were probably the first one he saw in real life. 10:20
12:42 Jaiden put on makeup for Miku
12:44 I’m so jelly!
the 7 eleven have what now?
I am a Japanese high school student from Yokohama. Thank you for making amazing contents about Japan! I am glad you enjoyed a lot!🥰
Wait.. Ur face is so familiar.. ARE YOUR JAIDENS BROTHER!! (Pls answer this ur face is kinda familier
Why did the ending make me emotional 😭 I love nerd culture 💫🥹
11:13
1:30 As a Canadian, yeah McDonalds here is pretty ass
11:14 caught in 4k
Now I just wanna see Alpharad do a Sanji cosplay. XD
5:59 I saw real breaking Nate and freaked out
Yall what was 11:15 explain
I mean hey SA2 wasn't horrible, but JAPAN THO
Did you went with Jaden
Probably should've said something when this video first came out but as a Jacob I feel honored to share a name with Alpharad and I'm glad to have found and watch his content
11:14 😂😂😂 I did not expect that 😂😂 I got a screenie
Imagine being friends of a content creator then one day being sent over a ton of Pokémon-related stuff
I’m in Japan now 2025 everything is so cheap now
The ending was so sick man!
I wish that I could see the pokémon in Japan 😢
mega awsome vid!!! and fun fact; yk tath in poland is holiday for donuts named ,,tłusty czwartek''
I was born in 2014 😂😂😂 (I am not joking)
did you kiss a guy
not nearly enough kirby stuff in japan on god
ANYAAA!!
I am sorry
Ok just found Jaiden and now Jacob. Who were his friends because I would love to see their channels too.
Where is Jaden?
13:01 iT's tHe gUY FrOm FoRtNiTe?
I found myself in Japan a couple weeks ago and I was very much the same. About 70% of the stuff I brought back ended up being gifts for everybody back at home. Feels good!
Like this VIDEO to gave him more money { NOT THIS COMMENT }
911
Erm what the freak  11:13 😭😭😭😭
evangelion mentioned RAHHHHH🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Alpharad is Santa in disguise
11:14 interesting

I need someone to total all the money he spent
Jaiden Animation is  with you I know because she have a other video of this
So, are we just gonna ignore what happened on 11:14
did you know that if you know what I know you will know what no one knows because your will know what I know when I know you know
Am I the only one who saw a frame of him kissing another guy at the end of day 4 not that there’s anything wrong with that
Imagine hating pokemon but live in a city where pokemon stuff is around every corner
Jaiden is so pretty….does she know that?❤
god is there for u in bad times
whudefuq I child what is corn but I think the c is a p
bro this video made me cry
SANJI!!!
20:50 give the, some JAPANESE SEVEN ELEVEN POOOOOOORN
Me watching this just for Jayden
When it came to Pokémon Scarlet, the only time I really participated in a raid event was when it was Walking Wake (for scarlet) and Iron Leaf (for violet). It was originally pretty hard for me to beat, but once I traded for a Miraidon, that mother f** one shot the Walking Wake. I was so glad that the raid Pokemon don’t immediately faint, and asks if you want to catch it first.
When Jacob was talking about the 7 eleven, I had to rewind it many times to make sure that I actually heard him right when he said “porn”
Who came here after watching Jaiden's video 👇
Just came back from Jaden
9:39 the chicukawa addiction is starting
The ending makes me smile every time
Fans: so how much money did you spend on your trip to japan? Alpharad: Yes
I’ve never seen a sponsor that I liked until now
I recently found your channel, absolutely love it and seeing the end, hear you say you are happy now and got your dream fulfilled, while also giving so much to your friends is absolutely great, wish more people would be like you!
Sanji san!
Nah, but why you got sanji hair though?
I WANNA GO TO JAPAN SO BAD!!!
Wow
Minute 11:13 bro kissed
My step dad will empty that store, bro 😞 the one piece he loves it 😔
the video started okay, but  15 minutes after, the jerk started some kind of self confession about himself and how he used to feel... which nobody cares.
They watched the gear 5 episode
this is making me feel better abt my own spending habits
2:50 OMG Demon slayer manga!!!!
yo what happened at 11:14
As an Australian seeing you spend the mount you spend is wild, then realizing that usd to aud is basically doubled sent me into shock hahahaha
Why am i getting emotional for all those gifts at the end man. Im a big strong man. But im ballin bro
ME
coming here after watching jaiden’s video for the billionth time, AND seeing the clips of friends opening their entire boxes FULL of gifts from jacob was just amazing

I havent really watched your content before but this was such a feel good watch. I got a little teary watching your friends so happy with their gifts. You know them well ❤
This video makes me wish I had friends, I have no friends to appreciate and buy gifts for and that makes me very sad

I love in the thumbnail of this video most of the straw hats are going left while zoro is going right 😂😂
Where is Jaden animations!
seeing this video, and then coming back after a few months of watching all of them interact makest his especially beautiful
the moment you stepped into japan, pokemon started overflowing with yen.

alpharad: this trip has finally found me true happyness after years of secret depression  jaiden: CHIKAWAAAAAAA LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
10:21 san ji san means old man lol

I like how in the thumbnail zoro just Gers lost
Jaiden In japan: buying Jacob: *Makes out with a random creator.*
C H I K A W A
Im currently saving up money and learning Japanese just for the possibility of visiting Japan in like 2 years, im so hyped even tho its so far away. Been watching this video on repeat not being able to sleep from excitement
What's the song that plays when everyone is showing off their gifts? It sounds familiar but I can't quite put my finger on it.
WAS THAT A PHOTO OF JACOB AND JAN KISSING?????????????????????????
it was with jaiden wasnt it
his friends smiles makes me so happy, they look so geniune
Yay Sweden is rated S tier!
WOOPER!!!!!!!! 25:02
I love how Jaiden had almost always mentioned Adam and had him in 90% of the frames yet he had a few videos of her and like one mention of her
Comfort video. 🩷
in germany we dont even have 7/11 🥲
MIKU!!!!
0:36 I can’t see the end of the horizon HATSUNE MIKU?!
11:14
To the kid who called you Sanji, they are 100% correct that you look like him.
The fact that he didn’t mention Jayden For like half of the video
2:26  best thing to list stuff including h*nt**
And you also went with Jaden Animation 😂😂
now im watching the IRL version of jaidens animation video... lol
11:14
i know that jainen came with you lol
What happened to that one girl who kept gambling for chikawa and made you get 6 suitcases and 4 backpacks?
hoooooooooooooooooooooooooddddddddddddddddddddddddddddiessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
For some reason watching other people’s hyper fixations is one of my hyperfixations. As well as some of the only videos I can just watch without doing anything else
Where's jaiden
11:14 ..?
Who else came here to see the jayden brain rot picture
are you Jacob from jaiden animations
woah I should really get into Pokémon- UNDERTALE!? 18:06
:D From groceries to . . . /_O what. . .
I'm sorry are we just going to ignore the kiss?
Same
1:31 if youre gonna put the union flag then why also put Scotland? I mean the scottish viewers all 5 of them would like it but they are part of the UK not independent
Fuistes con haiden
10:28 he was talking about your hair saying it looks like sanji's if you haven't realized yet
2:45 from groceries to WHAT?!
2:44
GROCERIES TO WHAT?!
Well in the beginning
I love how bro didn’t even mention Jaiden..  him watching the end of her vid:👁️👄👁️🫰😥
I live in Sweden
Did anyone see 11:14 at the right time
13:12 is that a body pillow?
11:14 if you want to see jacob kissing a man
Did you know in Okinawa they have a Pokémon Center there as well. Also at American Village they have Pokémon characters hidden all around the village for you to find. It’s called Pokégenic
What the deep 18:45
I'm scared cause the title I'm like I'm going to japan but now time to order 30 luggage's lol
11:14
1:31 LETS GO IRELAND IS  UP THERE
fornite was the perfect awnser
21:52 WHAT DID POINT CROW GET
Okay pause first 11:14
0_0
11:14 was bro drunk during this smth
Can someone list the timestamp when Alpha mentioned Jaiden's name? Bro kept saying "I" and "My trip" this entire video. I think I flagged it down to 12:07 before he even mentioned her outside of her being in footage.😬
12:32 demon slayerrr!!!
22:14 I guess the OMORI refererence guy doesn’t have a YouTube so ill have to do this for him: IS THAT AN OMORI REFERENCE ?!
seeing your absolute joy made me so happy, but then hearing you ask "what would you do?" and I immediately out loud went "I'd buy my friends so much cool stuff" and you just launched into such an absolute serotonin-fest of gift giving oh that's absolutely wonderful - hell yeah <3 it also just really goes to show the whole joy of making content like this in the first place - these games, shows, all of these things, they make us all so happy, and we gain a community of folks along the way :)
Is it just me or is the woman he kisses in 11:25 look alot like jaiden
11:14 was a crazy clip
15:29 OMG OHARA WHO HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK
Bro thought he was slick hiding him kissing another guy at 11:14
Jacobs such a good friend and im happy to see everyones reactions to the gifts, from ross getting spoilers to "IS THAT FUCKING MARSHAL?" and the excited squeels from cute plushies. What a ride of emotions and god bless them all
1:54 Jaiden spotted
POV: Jaiden and Alpharad’s wallet = RIP
11:15 omg 😳
11:10😭😭😭
BTW he went with Jaden animations
pro really sent his friend corn
So we saw that at 11:14 right? That’s Jan.
5:42 chiowa
12:41 - 13:25 …you don’t realize how jealous I am rn. i visited Japan. i didnt like miku back then.
Who was Jacob making out with 😂😂
11:14 ..... *sniffs* ...... ahem..... intresting
BAHHHAA IS NO ONE IS GOING TO POINT OTU AT 11:14 HE WAS KISSING SOMEONE XD
3:13  SURSKIT SPOTTED SCREAMS SO LOUDLY
I would have loved a detailed haul video where you show all the merch you got individually. Unless all the clips of people opening stuff is available somewhere?
Whats the song at 10:00?
The fact he mentioned jaden like 3 times in the whole vid is crazy
AYO  11:14
snoopy is fier
2:00 dukuna
Hearing that you went to Japan was fun but I loved the self reflection even more.  I am happy to hear of all your progress and I hope you continue to prioritize your health and happiness.  Fingers crossed that you can take more breaks and enjoy more time to relax.
11:14 BOY KISSER ALERT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔
19:36 birb
Jaiden:look at miku she has blue hair- * everyone around jaiden * BLUE TIE HIDING IN UR WIIIIFIIIIII-
i watch both vidioes and realized that nobody realized the reason he called you sanji san is because you have blond hair AND a brown beard gotee thing not just because hes never seen a blonde man
11:13 I did not expect to see Alpha make out with Jan. It was definitely for a bit, but shocking nonetheless. Alpha is the bi rep we need
Ummmm where is Jaiden
I love how Jacob gave everyone else something everyone ecstatic and pointcrow is just like I can’t show this
He made it out like he was jusy impulse buying, but seeing how much time and thought he put into his friends is just amazing. What a great friend to have
Can you do this with Jaden too?
11:14 🤨🤨🤨🤨
who's the guy that got a Miku otamatone and a Snorlax? 23:53
I watched Jaidens video first and then came to this one... i audibly laughed whenever I saw the size of the empty suitcase he brought along.
Are we gonna talk about 11:14?.... No? Okay
Jacob, your McDonalds tier list is FACTUALLY INCORRECT. Scotland is in the UK
That was the best twist i have ever seen in any video ever
😂 11:14
11:51 GOT ME DYING
Yaoi? In MY Alpharad video? Fucking awesome.
11:14 Had to go back and look again, bruh what happened that night XD
As show he said “then” he turn into Alistair
As show he said “then” he turn into Alistair
Between him and Jaiden Pokemon made more than the cost of flying them to Japan just from the amount of merch they bought lol
11:14, must have been the wind
Pokémon wanted you not to be fit for Wii fit
what did you do on 11:13 ?
Failboat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
i definetley should go to japan i need splaroon merch!!!!!
lol I cracked up when I saw him pointing at the mewtwo statue very funny
5:39  WEED CAT   (Inside joke)
11:14 what the actual FU-
Jayden was here !
Jaiden didnt get mentionned 😢
Tbh, as someone who lives in sweden i feel that mc Donalds is somewhat of a wildcard. Sometimes it tastes great but other times its just edible. 1:32
21:46  … holy cow
11:14  …Excuse me?!
15:51-19:20 (sniffles)
Wait... you like Sprigatito? Me too!
17,000…
I came after Jaiden’s video
Shibuya, did you visit the station safely?😂
My favorite moment of thsi video has to be everyone opening their presents and finding out what they got. Their reactions bring me so much joy, and it makes me want to be as good a friend as you even if only to see the same happiness in my friends' faces too (although that's a really damn high bar you just set. I don't have 17k to spend on merch or on... anything really 😂). Bless you man, and I'm really happy to hear you enjoyed your very deserved vacation
11:14 I cant believe that Jacob Alpharad Made out with Jan Pokemon Challenges
When i go to japan (if i even go) im booking it to the nintendo store and buying everything related zelda.
0:04 I remember you was conflicted..
11:14
I’m offended that Canadian McDonalds is lower than UK McDonalds. I’ve lived here since 2019 and their hotcakes are GARBAGE. 😭😭😭
11:14 the power of alcohol creates ships that I didn’t realize existed 😂
Hey, Jacob. I watched Jaiden's video before this. I hope you two had fun!!!
I felt like he didn't talk about maiden a single time
stop at 11:14
Did anyone else see geto and gojo in the thumbnail?
Who was he kissing at 11:14???
well now we need a Alpharad Macdonalds review video 1:31
11:14 AYOOOOOO
How much did he spend in total
Hey wait a minute one of those rage was on on my birthday I’m gonna say which one but you get the gist😅
11:14  what the sigma..
Why didn’t you mention Jayden? Wasn’t she there with you the whole time?
BUT WHAT IN THE HELL LOOK AT A 11:14 PLS :(🥲🥲🥲🥲
11:14 man…
JAIDEN LOVS HAUNE NIKU
R.I.P Wallet we lost a real one😢
The ending when everyone is opening their gifts 😢
Not even gonna lie, jacob is such a cutie. Plus hes such a sweet goober! I totally get the social anxiety too. People be wilin' be he seems so cool and id love to have a chance at being friends. Though getting to watch his videos while im eating is nice too ☺️☺️
11:14 WE SAW THAT WHAT
11:14…  gay.
11:14
SCOTLAND
11:14 uhhmm
He really looks like sanji
the mudkip brain rot within me was glued to the little mudkip plushie that was sitting at the edge of his shelf in the background, obscured by lens focus. He's just a little guy! <3
If you trimmed your beard you would look like sanji
Do you come with Jaiden Animations?
first stop when most of  us win the lottery
I'm Japanese and this video really helped me learn English.
11:14 MADE ME CUUUUUUUUM
How have i watched this yet dont remember a single bit of it .-.
10,001 comment
I saw Jayden’s face from the reflection of the McDonald’s screen
Who the heck is he kissing before day five
Burn out is a difficult thing to overcome but seeing you have a moment of peace makes me so happy for you. The endless gifts you personalized for all your friends is so heartwarming. You have gained a new follower.
it would be awesome and lucky to have a friend like you ngl,a great friend
damn, wish I had friends
so ur the one who side eyed jaiden in the car xd
Kunai with chain!!!
Did anyone else notice that one second where he was either making out with a man or Jayden                Like I swear if he was making out with Jaden🤬🤬🤬🤬
Oooh ok! So this is Jaiden Animations BF! Lol nice to know 😅
BREAKING NEWS:POKÉMON GOES COMPLETELY BANKRUPT AFTER SENDING YOUTUBERS JAIDENANIMATIONS AND ALPHARAD
I feel... financially responsible
1:32  THANK YOU FINALLY SOOMEONE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY ACCEPTS AUSTRALIAN FOOD TYTYTYTYTYTYTYTYTYYT TYSM
Is no one going to comment on the hidden gem that is Jacob kissing Jan at around 11:14?? XD
You went from Tokyo to Osaka... by PLANE!??! Have you not heard the good word of Shinkansen?
Bruh 11:14
Duo having sukuna eyes seems very realistic
11:14 nice
11:12 WOAH
11:13 11:14
Jacob: It wouldn't happen if not for my friends.  Jaiden: Chiikawa...
11:14 ayo sorry how can you be mad at fanfics when this is in your vid. Love you two but apprently as much as you do each other ❤
I'm here right after seeing Jaiden
2024 anyone?
why is nobody talking about 11:24 .
The ending is the best by far
Imagine barely mentioning ClickBaiten.

5:42 CHIKAWAAA
CHIKAWAAA!!!!
Who was he kissing?!
Wow thank u for mentioning Jaiden
Where is jaiden
Your friends are so lucky
I have to friends I don’t need to spend like hundreds of dollars for all my friends
Bro why is Norway McDonald’s c tier? It’s great.
Why is Sanji in the thumbnail twice?
1:57 I was using google translate non stop to listen how the phone said it and tried mimicing it to the personels, didnt help a whole lot when they asked me a question back T.T
5:42 chikoa (on the side)ready to be caught by Jaiden animations
Man you look like eminem.
And I watch your friend video, so I know all that😅
Bro stop drama dumping
Dude why you forgot to Introduce jaiden😢
10:16 “SANJI-SAN!”

11:14 what did I just see 💀
11: 14 what was that
Sanji??
11:14 so happy for them
11:14 Alpharad kissed Pchal???
Point crow💀
Beautiful. I relate to this on so many levels. I went to Japan last summer did some touristy things and stayed with a host family, and it changed me. Made me realize how unhappy I was here. Now I’m applying to go on exchange there for my next year of school, which I get results about on the 20th. This’ll probably get buried, but… well wishes! (Oh, and if you ever go back. Go to Akihabara in tokyo. It’s basically nerd heaven. With hundreds of arcades, figure shops and computer shops. (Although you might find some not safe for work things on higher floors of some buildings))
It’s its sanji
Just immediately looking for the Chikawa
20:02 watching the sheer joy as he essentially played Santa to his friends is beyond heart warming...i love this
11:14 Jacob what is this? 🤔
loved the video but paused at the wrong time 11:14
0:37
I know this vacation is over a year ago, but I'm happy to hear that you were able to have such a good time in Japan and are taking care of your mental health more. I hope that you continue to take necessary breaks and remember to enjoy your life. I'm sure you absolutely love what you do and have the best time streaming and making YouTube videos, but remember to have fun in the other parts of your life as well! I hope you get to take another long and fulfilling vacation like this again soon!
11:14 and 11:15?
The gift reaction montage had me in tearssssss❤❤❤❤ you're so freaking thoughtful, i love seeing reactions like that. It's truly the little things that matter most and your actions show that you truly love your friends dearly! 😭🥹
11:14 💀💀💀
I just realised jaiden did animation and you did irl 😂
日本にスリはほとんどありませんが何故か不思議とお金は無くなります。あなたが気が付かない間に…。
6:16 big Jan
11:13
We made the right guy popular
What do you mean the dutch McDonalds got a C. HAVE YOU EVEN HAD A MCKROKET 😂
dear alphard of the future, next time you go to Japan and shop like crazy again and don't have any bags to bring home, yk you can go to 7eleven and have it shipped home right?
14:56 why is hawaii ill timed
5:02 i once ate the mario Haribo but one Gold coin was rotten. It was bought in poland
11:14 so no one gonna talk about him kissing a guy?
11:14 new wallpaper
13:39 dengerous goods had me rolling on the floor
“This place had charms cups shirts hats Power and the coolest mugs ive ever seen” power just got a free spot there🤣 10:55
You didnt mention jadon

711 gas porn!!!!!!!!
2:44 From groceries to *what now?*
Look i know i am late to watch this BUT WHY 11:14
5:42 CHIIKAWA
Hey Jacob lets be friends
There’s something wrong with my I know when this was because of the op chapter
11:14 he kissed a guy
Does anyone realize that things in 7-Eleven from Japan (no.2 btw)[day 1]
Zoro getting lost in the thumbnail 😭
14:52 I don't get it
I was watching a compilation ov alpharad and pochallenges and they said they were making out in this video and it's real wtf-
“Spends 1 million dollars” No regret
I genuinely don't think Nintendo has problems with people playing mods, even pokemon mods, so long as those people promote the official games or Nintendo's brand as a whole. And seeing how much of a fan Jacob is, I can see them wanting to share their appreciation for his dedication to their brand, even if it doesn't always line up with their personal views.
11:14 O.o
13:12
The amount of persona music in this lmao
Wait, am I the only person who didn’t know that Jacob was Alfred?! 😶
Think Jaden cuz I'm visiting this video because she promoted it
glad to see ireland in A tier for mc donalds
Resume of the Japan Trip:  90% In Merch Stores 10% Actual Trip
You have Alfred doing the video of him actually recording the whole thing or what he did and then you have Jaden who just accidentally forgot to take a photo of what she was about to eat
I did
In Dallas during around June-July, they have an anime convention that also has Disney stuff and I am pretty sure it might have Nintendo stuff every once in a while,you can also meet celebrities! Me and my family go there every chance we get and wanted to tell you(and Jaiden) that it exists!!!
10:22 sanji saan
Where Jaiden…
11:14 what
the gift giving part has me in tears. you are the sweetest 😭😭😭😭
oh my god one day i will be as rich as you !!! i'll buy ¥200k merch without hesitation !!!! omg so happy for you
those mini pokemon plushes are making me rabid
I also am busy and stress so I feel the same
5:41 Chiikawa spotted
11:14 was …uhm…welll… very convincing
7:36 if I had a therapist, that is what I would say to them u are really just a cry for help
they: being friends  meanwhile my sister: is he dating jaiden animations?
I'll be honest, I'm rewatching this video to give myself an estimate on how much to save up for a trip to Japan. Thank you for the numbers, I rounded it up to $20,000 and I'm 2% there TwT
11:14 😱🏳️‍🌈
You didn't even mention Jaiden😢😢😢
Vckghcihvngfy fihy yg fiy iyhhufcgvgvtvgvIjijniuhuobbihbihvj6ugvguvu ug ut hng!   H v chj&

14:45 why was the announcement about hawaii ill timed?
yay aus is in s yayay  :D
I have zero self control when it comes to merch and I still ended up feeling anxious watching it add up on this video.
Ppl who are here bc of Jaden animations 👇
I once had a autographed world champion card. A kid ripped it in half...
The ending of this was so sweet 😭
Why didn't you  mention anything about jaden
As a dutchie, I underdstand why its at the bottom of the McDonald's tier list, its expensive and takes fake
didn't you go with the youtuber JadenAnimations? she taked about it in her youtube vid
sanji-san!
1:03 woopy boi
The best part was seeing Father gat a Kirby plush
as a dutch person i can understand why dutch macdonalds is wack!
11:14 thats insane, jan mustve been harder than a pokemon run&bun
It was just just brought to to my attention that jacob and pchal drunkenly made out at 11:14
I just relize about the thumbnail being the same with jaiden(diffrence being it is zoom out) and the fact zoro go to the right where the other crew was at the left
When you posted this video i realized that I was in the video

PV the Pokémon center to your wallet I just sent a pipe on to your mailbox. Enjoy.
The part were you were talking about growing as a person and the part were your friends got your gifts
2:50 OMG DEMON SLAYERRRRR
Hey, seriously, it was Jeiden with you, go, because I didn't see her in the entire video. Also, hey, she said that the two of them went to the Pokémon capionate, please answer.
Your forgetting Jaidenanimations😐😐
17000 dollars is crazy
woww
I would die a happy man if I got to go to japan, I would probably buy a lot of animal crossing stuff
Man massive respect
this is so late but i should say mcdonalds in scotland is so restaurant specific like for some reason all the ones in glasgow have given me food poisoning and the ones in edin just make me sad from prices,  dundee maccies always hits the spot like nothing else and being surrounded by equally hungover neds and the beautiful harmonica busker screaming at people who look at him the street down is something magical. S+
Im from sweden
"its really just a cry for help" best line 100%

Honestly, I got here right after watching Jaiden's video, but I got my eyes bawling out seeing the friends got gifts 💗💗💗

Now if you told me 2 years ago that Jacob Alpharad would be smoochin Jan for Pchal, id probably believe you 11:14
idk why, but pokémon is the one thing from my childhood that i can never get bored of. It just such an inspiring and wholesome franchise imo
Different qualities in both videos lol
Bruh they are probably dating alphrad and janden
4:37 skipped the sponsor
wait what porn?

Where Jaiden!?
What’s the song at 14:22?
😢no hay tus videos en español
I’ve never heard of you ever until I watched Jaiden’s video. This video popped up today and I thought, “huh this sounds familiar”. Anyways flash forward to now, you’re actually so sweet and seeing your friend’s reactions made me shed a tear. You deserve good man.

I like the part where all the friends got their gifts.
the difference between American eating habits and Japanese eating habits is how healthy the food is.

7:01 Jaden:3
Omg is that the divine white wall dog???????????
11:15😅
I do have to say that in Australia our McDonalds or Maccas as we call it is very tasty, probably because of how we have very good quality meat and whenever I go overseas I am immediately let down by every fast food chain
11:14
Oh my gosh THE ‘PEACE AND TRANQUILITY’ SONG THAT CAME IN WAS SO WELL TIMED
From groceries to … WHAT 2:45

“ From groceries to porn” nah what 💀
2:03 Why the fuck is Duokuna here
the whole last half of this video is the “to be loved is to be known” poem
as a Swede I am absolutely shocked you put Swedish McDonalds in S-Tier
11:14 he kissed a man
If anyone at all knows where that snoopy push was from or the company   that made it I beg of you please let me know bc I'm currently going feral because I cant find it even with Google lens 😭
3:44  yeah i will smash the pokemon with my level 100 pokemon😅
I can't believe that this video is now 1 year old
who here came from jaiden animations?
11:14 ._. ...dude...?
My family went to Japan and we nearly didn’t have enough Japanese currency to continue the trip but then a friend told us that in Japan 711 is a cash exchange!😂😂😂 Like what!
I would say no one will deny that buying your favorite things in Japan is like having a eternal heaven for yourself. I would also do the same like buy at least 5 or 10 mangas, some figures, plushies and other things that might be very good as a gift for others or would just keep everything to myself
Pause at 11:14  blink and you miss it
21:10 FYRUS!
I thought about something else when I heard shiubuia.
Rubber Ross and pokémon commented😮
Chikuwa :3
Me when I saw Demon slayer Manga 🥹
I'ma stay cringe though
Wait huh porn?

i know you went with jaiden she told us on her channel
I just came here because Jaden told me too😊😂😅
2:46 what did bro just say💀💀💀
you look like sanji
im so proud to be Japanese
This is my favorite video on youtube, because i get to see so much of the cool stuff in japan! its my BIGGEST dream to go there!
What are the odds I got into this video right after Jaidens Japan video🤣🤣🤣
I swear this is just a request from Jacob to get an accountant. Like bro just said “help” for 27 minutes
OMG PERSONA FIVE BACKROUND MUSIC
The whole trip was with Jaiden and 0 mention of her was made during the video lol
I have that game on my nentoedo switch 3:56
Hey dude you forgot about the jaiden/chicowaa moment
10:23 the small boy said blonde in Japanese
I see Lyn 👀 Nice to see another Fire Emblem fan 😁
This is the first time watching this guy honestly I fw him heavy. He's so hard working and deserves all his success God has truly blessed him🙏
i got super happy hearing that you gifted your friends a lot of the stuff you bought just for them, its such an amazing way to show them how they meant something in your life despite the ups and downs, im really happy for the person u have become even if i just started watching u teehee
SNOOPYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!! (Snoopy played a big role in my childhood)
11:15 if you pause here then umm jakub you have some explaining to do my man I'm telling Jaiden
7:00 YO, ITS MY FAVORITE YELLOW THINGY!
He’s forgetting that we have the power to slow down the video 11:14 😈
We love worlds hawaii 🗣️ 🔥
i need to spend thousands of dollars on pokemon merch immediately
How does Jacob not have 10M+ subs?
Where did you get the Eevee bags from I need them
Pokémon offered Jaiden not you
He got everything in the thumbnail even the mewtwo encounter and episode 1072 LOL
Me
18:35  peace and tranquillity
13:39 Somehow it took me 11 months to realize the sign said dengerous goods and not dangerous goods.
I watch your videos end parts and I get punched in the face with wisdom, your really awesome!
4:58 opanchuuuuu
Did anyone else catch Jacob kissing that other guy? XD TimeStamp: 11:14
When you don’t put together that alparad is either bi, pan, or gay…. And it’s AMAZING
It’s absolutely crazy to me that I went to japan around a similar time to you guys. I remember seeing the decorations for worlds in the airport and going to sunshine city’s pokemon cafe, and all sorts of the same stuff you guys did, and it’s surreal. I had a great time though, and it seems like you guys did too!
Wasn't Jaiden with you when you went to Japan or am I trippin?
I think you meant "Seven-Ereven"
HEH?! 1 MILLION?!?   😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫☠️
Ohara❤
Ssssssssplatooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnn n nnnnnnnnn

you make me inspired to be a crocheter just by watching you vids
I need someone to tell me who he was kissing at 11:16
Alpharad: *talks about how his friends being there for a long time and gifting them back and openly talks about his struggles for being a content creator and being burntout* Meanwhile jaiden: *_chikawa supremacy will take over the world_*
6:00 i never imagined that Realbrakingnate would be in this video for a few seconds
Alr I need to see Jaiden 🤨
I saw jaidens version of this experience and i just want to say, im so sorry for your wallet in that time;-;
PERSONA MENTIONED
11:14 pausing right here is wild
Hello! I hope I'm not taking too much of your time but if you could read my message then that would be great👌  We have all fallen short of the glory of God for our rebellion against him and we deserve hell punishment for it, that's why we need a savior and that is Jesus Christ. The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins and rose again, eternally triumphant over his enemies, so that there is now no condemnation for those who believe, but only everlasting life. That's the gospel, and if you believe truly in your heart then he promises you eternal life with him. I love you and God bless✝️💖  I love you Alpharad❤ Keep it up man🤙✨️
Yo I found him
11:14 enemies to lovers ahh moment 😂
I'm just noticing in the multiple times I've watched this video, I now see Jan and Jacob kiss
This has to be the best tax write-off in history.  Go on a sponsored trip, spend more than the trip was paid for, then give all the stuff you bought to close friends that are near and dear to your heart.  Well played Jacob Alpharad, well fuckin played.
i wanna be rich enough to buy stuff like this
YESSSS UK IS AT, A
Nerds with unlimited money go to weeb heaven
How’d you go to Shibuya I’m pretty sure it was destroyed October 31st 2018

11:14 caught me off guard
shame I stopped playing pokemon after sword and shield like it would have been so easy for them to make an awesome game. but no. we get buggy mess :(
2:36 TO WHAT?
I feel like Jaiden and him talked about their channels and their lives on that trip. Both their messages about their future sound very similar.
How come Jan pChal was in Japan?
Watching Jaidens video first is so much fun. Cause you imagine everything yourself and then see the real pictures. Also she spoke so nice of you at the end, I had to come over and see.
11:14 ???
Yo wtf 🤯💀 11:14

Me if I won the lottery
“And to this day, some of those favors haven’t been done”
9:56 rip mamba
pay attention to 11:07
Win the kid say sanjisan is so funny
From Japanese perspective, the reason that the Japanese mom apologized to you may be related to Japanese cultural matters. We barely talk to strangers. And her kid suddenly called you Sanji-san. That’s why she may have apologized to you.
I want buy the entire splatoon part😂
As a Jujutsu Kaisen fan, hearing the name of Shibuya is trauma being brought back up
Went to Japan in June. Watching this to remind me of all the stuff I miss.
11:14 what???
I love pigeons how many did you see
1:31 When did jacob go to the beautiful country that is ireland (also scotland is in the uk)
Sanji-san
9:40 Jaidens right eye already screams CHIIKAWA
YOU SPEND LIKE 10k..
これみて幸せになったありがとう！！
(I am Japanese. I'm writing with a translation app.)  I was so surprised by the amount of money I spent on my trip!  And there was a new discovery that there were facilities and experience sections that I didn't even know. It was fun! Thank you :)
7:35 Is this a cry for help?
Love you alpha but i have a suggestion. The way you felt about not being free apperently happens to alot of youtubers. Obviously im not in you position but alot of the youtubers that feel like that, say to just get to the gym or do somthing active. It really just clears your head.
11:14 that split frame? See for yourself.
wtf did he get pointcrow
Why didn't you mention jaiden
I came from jaidens animotion lol
Hey what about your plus 1 partner Jaden Have a good day though I hope you read this😅😅😅😅😅😅😆😆😆🌎🌏🌍🌐🕛🕐🕑🕒🕓🕔🕕🕖🕘🕰⌚⏰⏳⌛⏰⌚⏳⌛🕰🇹🇷🇹🇳
1:32 SO GLAD WHERE AT THE TOP BABY!!!!
The ending of the video literally brought a tear to my eye, it is so clear your friends are your entire world you are an incredible person  and every video I watch of yours I fall in love with this channel all over again
26:10 fyrus' reaction brings me to tears man. You can tell just how much Jacob has touched these people's hearts. I wish I could be even half the friend that Jacob is.
Did you call jaiden your accountant
9:40 that's the face of someone who just lost it's mind
I hope you have the happiest life you could ever wish for❤
I’m pretty sure please is actually ください and おめがいします is to say please in a different way. Idk the difference.
Dude i want to go to japan so bad, its not even funny😭
alpharad is the blonde american adult version of me but with money    abhorrently addicted to nintendo
7:36 not funny
from groceries to what
Omg Jayden animations,!,,,!,,,!

1:31 I went to Denmark earlier this month and tried the McDonalds there- they have jalapeño poppers, French onion burgers, and mini breadsticks Also, they have tiramasu-flavored Oreos in stores there.
not enough*
As an Australian thank you for putting us on top of the trot list🎉❤
Let’s gooo, dept
Take it from someone who's recently been to Japan and spent 2 weeks out there. Japanese 7-Eleven is literally a tourist's best friend.
23:48  "yoo"  "S N O O P Y :D"
ho no...9:37
一体彼はこの旅でいくら溶かしたのか。金持ちなのはわかったけど心配になる。
to Starlive13: same😂
WHY CANT I SUPERTHANKS THIS VIDEOOOO
11:14 is wild
man this makes me wish I was one of Alpharads friends. Not for any of the stuff but purely because he's just a heartwarming dude who seems to brighten up everyone elses day
Fuecoco fans👇
Bruh u were with Jaiden most of the time
This got deep and was a great video
Not favorite part  is his friends opening their gift.
21:05 who's this girl? she cute af
Bro you can speak English in Japan 🇯🇵
Im in norway and the only thing  good about McDonald’s is the nuggets and the other branches isnt Even worth mentoning
I saw jaden at the back
One piece vid
you are one of the best to do it live your life to the fullest
man congrats alpharad you made it in life if you got sponsored by Pokemon
Dang he didn’t even mention jaden went with him once 💀
Is jaiden going in an emo stage in life?
Jaiden habe that yakuza vibe
yokohama..? as in.. The same city THE HIT SHOW BUNGO STRAY DOGS WAS LOCATED????? BUNGO STRAY DOGS MENTIONED?? YOKOHAMA MENTIONED???
Me and I have a question. Are you gay
I have scream tail
the fact that he did not mench Jaiden lol
JAIDEN CAME TOO
TO P**N ABSOLUTELY CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD
Holy moly, I’ve only seen you as an avatar in Jaiden’s videos and was so shocked by the beard 😂. Looks great though
ah yes, the spending of the merchendice. what a commitment.
that one frame on 11:14 where they kiss 💀💀
And Jaden too
OH MY GOD I JUST NOTICED ZORO GETTING LOST IN THE THUMBNAIL
Idk if I already commented on this video in the past but idfc, rewatching it has made me wish that one day I can be the Alphard in someone's life
Omg Jayden has tattoos!!
MEEE
11:14 WTF????!!!!!!
I didn’t even have to watch a cooking video to see 2 men kissing? Let’s go
Just here to catch a glimpse of Jaiden🫶🏼
11:14 hmmm kinda sussy, but proud💅
Play omega strikers
Anyone realized that Jaiden animation and alpharad in there thumbnail shot they both used the same backround
11:14….
8:03 ummmm…
6:16 🚌🚌🚌🚌
2:29 yes!
0:46 😂
0:17 ummm…
Him knowing what to get each of his friends was something so heartwarming to see, knowing which pokemon they like to each of the shows and what specific merch they wouldve loved. You could really tell that he's a really great friend and a great person just from that
11:28
I liv i norvei
I realize I wrote orange juice 😂😂
Fuecoco the OJ 0:34
why didnt you mention jaiden being with you?
(Everything other franchises) Was there any Sonic stuff at all over there?
Whats the song at 20:50?????
I came here after watching Jaiden animations video
Just noticed 11:14 💀
You do kinda look like Sanji tho
hay what about jaiden she atlest talked you in her video🤨
Alpharad:making this video and it being wholesome Jaiden:Chikawaaaaaaaa CHIKAWAAAAA CHIKAWAAAAAAAAA and ends up (accidentally) stealing a Chikawa umbrella
Since this English speaking guy went to a Japanese karaoke bar in this video, I feel the need to point out how butchered the English pronunciation of "karaoke" is. The Japanese pronunciation is like "kah-rah-oh-kay", and for some reason the English pronunciation is "keh-ree-oh-kee". Literally, how the hell did we end up pronouncing it that way? It's not even spelled that way! I can understand "ke" turning into "kee", but how did "ra" turn into "ree"?
How did I not realize that Jacob is Alpharad
and it tased like dr. pepper-a wise man
You can just know jaiden was hooked onto the claw machine on the right trying to get atleast one plushy 😂😂😂 5:42
i love capitalism
We*
11:13 🤣
jaiden is having a c hikawa brain rot pov jaiden:chikawaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4:48 this is chinese food tho
Jacob: buying more than 3000 pokemon stuff and the hardships of being a content creator  Jaiden: c h i i k a w a
Talk about Jaden
I immediately recognized you from a Jaiden animations video
8:25 you said the place and all I could think was the incident in jjk
"...Chikoawa"
how much did he spend
😮¥
Reasons I love Japan  1# every Nintendo thing and toys #2 literally my culture  #3 food  #4 blooming flowers and nature  #5 ye Edit: also anime Another edit music
America❌ China❌ Japan✅
bro you forgor that jaidin came with you
I spy Chihuahua
how many chikawas did jaiden buy 😓
2:45 yo I uhh think you skipped over something-
I think you got featured in Jaden's animabout. The Japan thing cause it right now. It sounds very same. I wouldn't be surprised if you got lost and got on the wrong train. Cause that's what Jayden Did.
.,.
Holy crap guys its sanji san
it took me way too long to realize that the things they can't show on stream are probably the questionable content from 7-eleven
Did anyone else notice he kissed someone?
Wait a minute. I just realised that the background of the thumbnail of this video is the same background as jaidens video
Bro u look like sanji
have you earned all your money back from this video like I’m curious?
You kindof look like jaidens brother I am I right

I went to Yokohama this spring and I agree that it was an amazing experience, I recognized a lot of the places in the video from my trip. It’s so cool how you got your friends gifts while you were there.
Anime for life🎉😂❤

Jaiden

17 THOUSAND DOLLARS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Um u started the exact same month was born in the exact same day.
Where’s Jaiden ?
Is that zoro getting lost in the background
Ive seen Jaiden Animations video
What's the music playing at 20:54? It's so good and sounds familiar - is it from Diamond?
From groceries *to porn* to pre-made meals
glad finally someone put russias mcdonalds in C tier. i had it once and it was horrible—
I nose you be kos jaden your best friend and you baid so me I things and konsert ❤🎉😊😅😏😌🏜️
What the heck you’re not including Jaden in the whole thing sorry if I’m not listening because I just watch your video halfway through sorry but mention Jaden every single time she was the one who got the tickets😢😅
11:14 woah
7:51 JAIDEN HAS TATTOOS?!?!?!?!?
Jacob what is your reaction to the jaiden chinkuwa obsession
Was alpharad there for the shabuya incident
Seeing everyone happy with what you gave them was one of the best things I’ve seen on YouTube ever :)
I can’t believe I didn’t know you knew point crow. I love Zelda.
Lucca Comics ti aspetta qui in Italia(!)
i saw  him kissing a man 💀
Who realized zorro was getting lost in the background

Bro why was it sad 😭😭😭
11:14 gay

Is that frickin jaiden
Alright Jacob u got me man ill sub frick. Great content love the care u give ur friends.
I started watching alpharad more recently and damn he us incredibly relatable rn especially with his talk about happiness😅
The little kis thinking you were Sanji was so cute😂
whats funny is how jaiden in her video said that some kid called alpharad "sanji-san?" lol
Bro forgot jadan that he went with
This video is just beautiful.
23:50 SNOOPY 💕
He barely mentioned Jaiden
I think I'm going to leave Japan with the same amount of suitcases and bags as him, or even more!😅😅
BRO WHERES JAIDEN?
I am here for jaiden
yo nah who pused the video at the exact moment when jacob shows a picture of him kissing some dude xd
I love the jump shop like I have been there a lot!
7:29 The way this is almost 2/3 of my 8th grade trip 😅
it's ok, i'd also be conflicted... on how to not go crazy if i saw miku in japan after landing
Ayyy wheres Jaiden????
Did he even say jaiden
11:14 WTH
I knew this was the right vid when he said "And then I stumbled upon Jaiden forming an entierly NEW hyper fixation" and he showed her with the bear (I forgot his name I'm sorry)
Anybody see that in 11:14😂
I forget Jaiden is Tated
seven elevun mikibuhh *insert rest of the miku meme*
Was that soundtrack, from tom nucks store?? In animal crossing!?
So did we see the clip of him kissing a man right
I saw the chikawa claw machine. Oh no 😨
does anyone know the song at 5:59 ty
Aww that's beautiful man. Made me sub
11:14 hang on what was that really short clip??? 😳😳
Who else saw how he kissed someone in the minute 11:12 😮?
If you're looking for something more in life, seeing that something is missing, Jesus Christ is always here to help you and guide you. Its never too late to go to Church and find true community
15:29  ohara a really good one piece theorist just casually shown without any extant to it
Alpha and PChal damnnnnn that caught me off guard😂😂
jaiden face reveal??? 11:07 its kinda blury so
You do look like sanji 😂
Seeing all his friends opening their gifts was so wholesome i couldnt atop smiling
He call u saji
11:14 bro was kissing someone
For a brief moment at 11:14 you can see alpharad making out with someone
Face reveal of Jaiden?! ( I haven’t seen her face ever lol )
7:50 luba from brazil!!!!!!!!!
Wow I came on this channel after Jaiden Animations & what a cool guy.   Virtual hugs & support keep it up, you got a subscriber!
8:15 was fully expecting him to say the place where everyone got killed in a certain show
Me
Hi! First video I watch, made me very happy to know you're happy for some reason, enjoy life!
I don’t know how to explain but I feel like Japan is like a parent who tries really hard to like and understand their teenage child’s interests 😭
Legendary clip on the bar
23:45 "uhhh, sexy babes" what an intellectual comment
wait i thought jaiden went with you to japan
I've been through that: Are you happy now? thought before.
This video exemplified my urge to go backpacking across the planet. Starting in LA going south and ending in columbia l. Then go to madrid and go thru  barcelona paris brussels rome vienna hamburg munich berlin and end in warsaw. Then i ho to morrocco and south east Africa. Then i go all over india them go to thailand vietnam the phillipenes and sydney. Then i go to a few places in japan seoul chile Argentina brazil and then i fly back to LA from Brasilia and then end at my house.
That ending almost made me tear up! I felt so happy for them!
HEYAAAAA JAIDEIN~~      I saw a vid by her on my home page and then I scrolled down and saw you even though I never watched u
I wish that Game companies were like this outside of E-sports. All that decor is fucking amazing.
Norway McDonald’s is definitely an s tier
He said “we” like 30 times and didn’t mention he was with jaiden
Here cause of Jaden lol
I swear i saw somthing around 11:13-11:14.... probably the wind
The Sanji-san kid is such an adorable interaction xD
11:14 UMM
Im from norway
i watched purplecliffs vid first nd then this one AND then jaiden's and i was like wth
11:14 huh?
Using the Kairi’s theme right after saying the line, “I felt like a husk of a person.” Was perfect
Can confirm about the 7/11, went to Japan in 2019 and had some of the best onigiri Ive ever tasted there and that’s where we got most of our breakfast during our stay
I love double big mac....cuz I have a big back😭✋️
I am laughing at Jaiden really deadass rocking a full migu drip merches
did no one notice the "kink stuff" that happend on 11:13
サンジさんです
11:14 pretty hilarious moment
11:14 hell yea
not zoro being lost in the thumbnail 😭
This dude flew out on Pokemon's dime and immediately bought pornography, and Pokemon still commented under this
11:14 KISS??????????
Good
11:14 may lord have mercy
OCTOBER 7 IS MY BDAY
i live in austraila and why is it at the top of the McDonalds tier list
Isn't this the one where you are with jayden because it's sounding the same
Me when i spend twice the amount i spent on my entire pc setup on pokemon merch in one store
“uhh.. sexy babes”  “YOOO SNOOPYY”
11:14
new viewer here. the vids of your friends touched my soul and bone marrow😭 the sweetest thing everrrr
sukuna as duolingo, makes sense
i love how he never directly says that he went on the trip with jaiden
11:14   Thats all
Costa Rica on B tier? Honestly, I’m honored that you visited us
Hi sanji😂
Absent of Jaiden for most of video was weird particularly when he kept saying 'we'
Can you go to Tokyo Dome City for me as my wish
11:14 DAMN
Jaden with the miku hugy
7:00 of the vid. ME: Whait WHAT!IS THAT JADEN?!!!
Japan is the best place ever. Hands DOWN.
That little thing at the end is so holesome
Yo did I see Ohara the ONE PIECE guy!?
SANJI-SAN IS THAT YOU?
I'm sorry, WHAT 2:45
Dude jaiden cmae wth
Did you go with your friend because I saw her video first and she was with you in experience
SEEING EVERYONES FAVORITE POKEMON WAS SO FUCKING WHOLESOME
i watched this video after watching jaiden's video about the same trip in hopes of seeing some videos and pics of the trip. sorry to jaiden as i know this guy is her best friend, but i find this guy exceedingly unlikable and self-centered. jaiden talked constantly her whole video about "this is what *we* did!" and she included him in almost every animation shot, and his video is endless "me me me" and "this is what *i* did", almost never mentioning jaiden. this guy just has rancid vibes. urgh. oh and gift-giving is just a way people who hate themselves try to get people to like them. im putting money on it right now that this guy gets cancelled eventually for something absolutely awful.
19:46 thats soooo much money Id never be able to spend that much even if I wanted too. I would spend a few thousand though (Not judging)
25:11 The way the audio sounded idk how to explain it- further back in my headphones, I wasn't looking at my screen (was petting my cat), and when she started talking I thought my mom was behind me (it's 2:34am) and I started looking around frantically trying to find where the voice was coming from. 😭
The one piece is real
bro's wallet just found a secret dark souls boss
Something weird, at 11:14
O My Cat Are So Much Stuff 7:20
Chape NIS
Alpha rad is way too sweet, and is way too funny for any of our own good. Glad I found you randomly by seeing Balan’s wonderland video and thinking “Drama king top hatted fool? Don’t mind if I do”. 😊
duuuuuuudee you are snji lol but he wouldn't do 11:14 unless he was on Momoiro Island tho haha
The fact that alpharad didn’t click bait jaiden for the first time ever is wild to me.
9:53 shows Alexander warrior jar from Elden ring, I was freaking out
i love in the thumbnail has gojo, luffy, nami, sanji, gojo, geto,anya, loid, yor and the cool buildings, THEN UUU
11:13 . slow it down at .25
My favorite pokemon is magnemite so I would kill to be there 7:52 💀
This makes me wish I had more money to travel and buy stuff for my friends
11:14 ah yes this is what I would see in a typical Tuesday
This is were it starts 9:38
seeing your friends reactions to your gifts is the best thing ever
I know your brother Friend is but I don’t know that name is Doug girl and he love  a Like a blue hair the king of it and the robot talking girl you know
9:52 the holy great jar spotted 🙏😔
11:14
You actually spent $1723.23 on the worlds popup shop
sorry but in the tier list you have the norwegian flag my only question is when tf have you visited norway and why isnt there a video about it
Was Jaden with you
You didn't have those light things in the Miku don't you
Alternative title: Alpharad touched grass and had an existential crisis while Jaiden hyperfixates about Chikawa
No one you going to question him kissing someone….okay then
18:34 the hat in time music hit diff
Im only half way thru i just had to pause as say. I found you from the not overwatch video and fell in love with the content. Your one of the few content creators I genuinely enjoy watching still. So thank you for everything youve done!
Dang bro did the soy face
Don't insult Japan by calling anything of it like Fortnite   Miku is great i like Luka more
Jiden and Jacob now literally losted all of their life savings
you do in fact look like sanji
Highest grossing media ever, we wonder why
am i the only one who saw Alpharard doing some weird things with another guy at karaoke-
11:14 😰
you didint talk that JaidenAnimation also was with u
I will say. I put off watching this video for months. Kinda glad I did, today was a rough one and I needed some laughs, and more importantly some wholesomeness
Manga are a little bit like comics/magazines.
I can see what happened due to that Maushold mural... Planting seeds.. It looks similar to Chiikawa
i love how half the presents are just random shii  but then theres like one or two actual good gifts :)
i got a pokemon ad before this video, what sorcery is this?
AUSTRALIA IS IN S TIER FOR MACCAS???????
Who already watched Jaiden's video
We have double Big Macs here in Canada! I just assumed it was in the States as well
11:14 i saw that, you silly goob
21:35 LOL 22:28
bro has no more money. Never would see a youtuber become poor.
Um so i want someone else to go to 11:14 on the video and slow it down and please tell me you see it too 🫢😅🤔🤔🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
11:14 bruv wha
Anyone wanna explain what happened the split second at 11:14!?!?!?!?😮😮😮😮
10:40 if a child come to me, and mistake me with any character, be that sanji, santa claus or whatever, i'll just pretend i am that character for the child.... like, for real, you had the oportunity of making that kid's DAY i wish you would have taken it XD he would be the coolest kid in school, when he said he met sanji in real life
5:45 the best thing about this little mermaid? it is the real one.... **looks angrly at the live action**
I love how the most shocking thing abt this vid for me was that Jaiden has tattoos🤣❤️
surprised jacob or jaiden didnt get into any trouble from the tattoos
I really wanna know why my country (the Netherlands) is at the bottom in C tier together with Norway
The world needs more friends, and people, like you, man. True friends don't get jealous or look down on each other, but support each other how they can. Hope for humanity stuff right here
your job is fucking awesome
OMG Jacob is so nice I could never
So my friend went to Japan and she gave me that exact same Evie she had a lot more but she gave me that one. It’s on my water bottle now.❤❤ cause you can only get it in Japan and she has a bunch of stuff from Japan. You can never get here. In the USA 3:17 😊
I’m new to watching YouTube but I’m noticing, like, every hugely successful YouTuber may be rich but damn, so many of them are burnt TF out and all have had such mental health struggles and conquests.   TY for the content but dang.  Sending you so much love and support. If you ever just need someone, I’m a no one, but I’m here for you if you ever find yourself “alone” despite having the success and friends.
Chikawa? CHIKAWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!
Lol
11:14 WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THIS
I came here bc of Jayden
Alpharad: calmly explains everything that happened Jayden: CHIKAWAAA! ONE PIECE!! CHIKAWAA!! MIKUUU!! CHIKAWAAAA!!!! Pokemon. CHIKAWAAAAAAA!!!!! ONE PIECEEEEE!!!!! HOT TEMPERATURE!!!!!
I went to Tokyo a week ago and i just wanted to watch this to reminisce lol. Amazing 🥰🥰
WAIT MT MOM WENT TO JAPAN? CAUSE I GOT DAT TEDDY- 22:13
I also learn Japanese from Duolingo 😅😅😅             And doesn't understand some words cuz I just know some sentences and words and just learns how to read the letters or something in Japanese
“So while me and Jacob were in a shop a little Japanese boy pointed at Jacob and went “Sanji-San!” Before his mother yanked him away.  To this day, I can’t stop laughing about this interaction.  Poor kid saw a blonde hair guy for the first time in real life and instantly thought he was Sanji.” -Jaiden Animation's video of Pokémon sent me to Japan!
WhEReS jAdEn😭
I can’t believe a kid thought you were Sanji from One Piece lmao
What happened with karaoke 💀
Spending $63 for a Dragonair plushie is crazy 💀
11:14 - huh. interesting.
Jaidin was there I know she was
1:32 as an Australian myself, this does not bring me joy most people i know including myself would rate maccas as a c or d tier fast food joint
Yep…It’s really hard not to spend more in Japan because it’s 3 times more cheaper than in our country 😅 and yep..I love all that I bought…
BRO DID NO OKE SEE SOMEON3 KISSING SOMEPNE IDK WHO KISS3D AND IM NOSIE I WANNA KNOW BUT I CAN'T SEE FOR POOP😭😭😭😭😭
The fact that Jacob knows all of his close friends so well is very heart warming to say the least. What an awesome guy he is ❤
What surprised me the most isn't that he gave them to his friends, but he CAREFULLY SELECTED the merch based on what they liked. That's hardcore!
The one pice the one pice is real can we get much higher oh so high iiiiiii
We’re Jaiden she came along didn’t she????
Did yall even notice he said porn when he was in the 7 eleven😂😂😂
11:14
i wish i have friends
Wow
2:46
Ummmmmmmmmmmm😳🤣 11:14
7:35, Its really just a cry for help 😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀
Can we talk about when it was at 11:13 Jacob making out with someone else,Srly that sh*t was hilarious😂
Spam pause around 11:14, and you'll unlock an "easter egg"
Who are the characters on the thumbnail?
Bro where is Jaiden😭
The end is really wholesome
Well you and Jaiden made this 43 year old want to play video games on my days off. Also I want to keep watching you two. I am playing Legend of Mana and all Mana games when I find them. I want to also have fun, money doesn't matter and I want to continue to see you happy.
i saw that single frame bro. you aint fooling nobody
8:19 PFFT Idk why this stands out to me so much but seeing the led lights flickering because of the voltage really takes me back. I remember trying to take pictures of so much stuff and it just wouldn’t show up on my camera properly.
I don’t watch one piece what happened in episode 1072 I’m genuinely curious
Um why do you have a animated character but you have your face out alot
好看的，我也爱Pokemon，谢谢啊。
i still wanna know why u didnt mention jaiden
Fun fact Japan taxi's are more expensive than US
2:47 I’m not the only one that heard that right?
hello sanji
I like your hair
11:14 omg
Macdonald in Hong Kong his bubble tea
suprised no one is mentioning alpharad kissing some dude at 11:14 for a frame
11:14 ✨
This video is basically just his wallet crying😂
2:45 to what!?!
Jaiden: Having a good time, geeking out, making poor financial decisions for things that make her happy. Alpha: Having a good time, geeking out, making poor financial decisions to make his friends happy.
it ddint feel 7 months ago i swore i saw this 17 hous ago
Should definetly try maccas in new zealand
"rotom vacuum cleaner" 😭😭😭😭😭
Where is Jaiden Animations ?
11:14 From enemies to lovers🤣
Sanji-San
9:57 😅
11:14 IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT JACOB AND ONE OF HIS FRIENDS MAKING OUT WOTH EACHOTHER!?!?🤨
Yooooooo did not expect Paladins at 16:24 , that game was so fun back in the day when I didn't have the money for Overwatch
М
What happened 11:13 ?
Miku :D
ACE
11:14 Part is very 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓴𝔂
did u find majima from yakuza
Realizing you're chasing something that doesn't make you happy is one of the worst feelings I've ever felt. It's good to know others have been in that boat and gotten through it too no matter how long or short.
I watched this from my nintendo switch
SANJI
18:00 and get jaiden chiikawa
Sanji-san
11:14  hes being to happy
What; 11:14 look closely
WHAT DID YOU DO ON NIGHT 4 T_T
UHM- 11:14

14:50 wait why was this ill timed...what did i miss oh no
For the dumb american from chicago- why was it ill timed? Have I missed something on the news again?
"Fifty shades of fucked up" had me dead 😂💀😂
Where is Jaiden?
WHAT?!?!? Sweden is one of the best mcdonalds??? *pats myself on the back* ”it’s nice to know kiddos workin themselves to the bone actually do a good job…”
Why is no-one mentioning the 9 frames of him and Jan kissing? xD
Ok but why do one of his friends sound like beowolf😂
11:14 we’re just gonna ignore this? Okay
7 eleven in asia in general is insan
17 THOUSAND DOLLARS
1:31 put finland on that list right now.
1:32  were better than American McDonalds Thank (im British)
how is the man he kisst
Dang... i wanna be as good a friend to my friends as he is to his :'D. Hosting a whole awards show for them, going to japan and giving all of them presents? bro. i wanna be like this guy
The compilation of all of his friends receiving their gifts, especially ones where they thought "Oh I don't talk about this as much, how did he know me so well?!" was so sweet. Actually such a dream come true for everybody involved!! Truly is the dream to give back to the people you love and care about so much.
as a swede please dont goto mcdonalds here evenif you  rate it s tier you should goto max the best fast food chain around here.
P
Ok so who'd you kiss at 11:14
I know who came Jaden
RIP your wallet
Cute and wholesome.  You're a great friend.  Glad you enjoyed your trip/vacation.  One day I strive to visit Japan myself.
Damn. You are such a good friend. I only just found your channel a few days ago, but I'm incredibly glad you've found a happy place. ♥
11:12 WAIT WHAT!!!!!!
See... Jaiden didn't the entire amount for the trip, and damn.
11:14 👀
Jayden is like oh your done with your video it took me 4 month to make and draw and plan my 30 minute video Miku Miku you can call me Miku blue hair blue tie hinding in your wi-fi
You love your friends so much I love this
Where is the short clip at 14:44 from? It's not Pokemon Horizon, or is it?
If it sparks joy then buy the hole place with all the stuff in it 😙👍
Real ones know that true wealth is in relationships. A gift for a good friend is never too expensive! Thanks for the video Jacob Alpharad!
:)
seven-eleven is the bucees of japan
Am I under a rock? Who is he making out with at 11:14?
Still want to go one day, but I felt all that pain for all those extra suitcases and shame buying lol
I walk like 7000 step a day.
2:10 s7kuna l8ngo
Wow we dont see jaiden very often but shes hot not in a creepy way but genuinely very attractive i wish she could see that for her
11:14 wtf
who else saw Alpharad kissing a certain someone in that karaoke moment. Like i heard Alpharad was "open" but didnt expect that lol
Ëå
I watched the Jaiden video earlier, it's cool to watch this and see things from his point of view
Im so happy youre happy dude, live your best life!
11:14 ...
Bruh, if a young manga fan thought I was an irl fan favorite character, I would take it as a flex
I came from jaiden animations😭
Before whatching this there was a pokemon add😂
Bro barely even mentioned the chikowa thing
Name of song that played at the end of the video please
9:55
サンジ?
Is Jaiden there??
Jacob: Enjoys a well deserved 3 weeks off Also Jacob: Brings back presents He enjoyed the experience but people can enjoy the gifts
He is so nice and funny and he is so so sweet, and the fact that he spent that much money for his friends is really special, but man, the language!! There are more bad words in this 27 minute video than in an R rated movie!
Jaidens anime looks nothing like like not Evan any tattoos
Jan literally looks like a homeless guy the first time he shows up in the video and I am so here for it lol
Wish you show jaiden In you video
Just want to say this video is very entertaining and incredibly heartwarming as well as inspirational. I love how thoughtful you are toward your friends and the appreciation you have for yourself for getting to where you are now. It felt like a little bump that I needed to start creating again, entertaining people is all I want to do. Being 35 I feel like it’s not an option anymore, but this gave me a push in the right direction and sparked something I thought I had lost. Thank you.
alpharad:taking a pic jaiden:*gets another chikawa* ALPHARAD LOOK I HAVE ANOTHER CHIkAWA AND THE OG IS STILL IN MY POCKET🥹
why didnt u mention jaiden?

le ruissellement: de la théorie à la pratique
Great video as always Sanji-san!
Chikowaaa
me
i know this video is fairly new still but I love rewatching it, especially on the segment surrounding friends being the main ones to inspire and support you. I feel the same way with my friends and hope to one day bring this amount of gifts and treats to them too. maybe one day, and I use this video to inspire that. thank you Alpharad <3
Heard of you from Jaden
11:14
Everyone needs a Alpharad in there lives.
11:14
11:14 prepare ur eyes
11:14 How many beverages did u consume
AINT NOBODY TALKING ABT 11:14 ???
What did you send the guy that said he can’t show it on stream?
I can teach you some Japanese if you want to bro
Hell yeah, social anxiety
11:05 is 'most replayed', is it? Interesting
does anyone know the name of the song that starts at 10:12? I've been looking everywhere for it
Jaiden!
Jaiden send me there for that
Jaiden came there too!
... The final chapter made me cry ❤
you are trully happy there! XD
in some of the moments there's jaiden you noob
why didn't you include jaiden she is the reason you're there
Is he gay😢😢😢
Looking at the bento pokemon gave, i can see why jaiden was struggling. I thought there would be a section of rice and fruit like the one in the animation but that literally all has fish in it
YOU NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT JAIDEN
11:14 ummm....that kiss was unexpected
13:37  it's me!!!
Sanji-San

I live in Australia and i think the McDonald's is pretty meh but is it really that good in comparison to America!??! Your McDonald's must really suck or I'm just used Shazam o the "better" McDonald's.
me: ._.
YOU SPENT YOUR TRIP WITH JAIDEN
I’m so happy for you, this almost made me cry:,) You all deserve to be happy❤
Japan is my equivalent of a Disney Adult’s Disneyland, I wanna get rich just to go there
You made a lot of people really happy! ;)
Omg the kiss😮
I just realised, instead looking for a friend like Jacob why not I’ll be Jacob to all my friends        But firstly tho I need friends🥲
11:14
11:14 is anyone gonna talk abt this part 😭😭
Mama look... sanji-san
Im kinda glad that I dont live in Japan I would ruin myself to get all pokemon.
Band kids:*really jealous that alphrad saw a Japanese orchestra*
sorry but 11:14 caught me OFF GUARD
The fact that he barley mentioned jaiden 😂😂😂😢😢😢😂😂❤❤❤
11:14
Double Big Mac is available in Canada...which you rated Canada as b tier. Wait until you hear about *GRAND* Big mac, that comes around once a year in Canada. I demand a redo for my country.
To be loved is to be known, and you can tell you put so much thought into each of your friends boxes. So gorgeous !
His friends reactions are so heartwarming
sanji-san? (im from jaden chanel)
2:59 - 3:06   Me fr fr
YOU FORGOT TO MENTION JAIDEN AT THE START Her video is the only reason I am watching this
If I was rich I'd live in japan
11:14 Pog
LESS GO SWEDEN STIER
And jalden gets nothing
11:15 I accidentally paused the video and saw this 😅
I know u missed the bus😅
I'm confused by how much less Alpharad mentions Jaiden on the trip than Jaiden mentions Alpharad in their video. If you just watched the Alpharad video, they're barely there.
YOU MADE OUT WITH HIM
So How much money should I have in case if I ever decide to go visit Japan and I want to go on an insane shopping spree?
Atleast he put scotland in A
After starting the part about 7-11 i was half waiting for the mention of adult magazines they just have on the shelves 😹😹 going there on a school trip in grade 8 was an experience when we were getting lunch
SANJI!?!?!?! IS THAT YOU!??!?! 😱😱😱
11:14 …………………..
8:14  And the place where season two of JJK happened sooooo yea
As a gift giver myself... jacob alpharad is a man after my own heart. That end segment is so amazing ❤️
So are we going to ignore when Jacob said porn in the 7-Eleven? I’m just asking.
YYYYOOOO THE ANRI T-SHIRT 22:05
11:14 Alpharad kissing a guy💀
HOW DARE YOU MAKE ME CRY OVER HOW FUCKING AWESOME OF A FRIEND YOU ARE YOU SWEET AMAZING SON OF A BITCH!
11:14
Did anyone but me saw the scene when alpharad and his friend kiss?
8:17 shibuya the place where sukuna killed everyone 😁
11:14?
The company paid for your travel and you guys probably still managed to give all their money back.
11:14 🎉
Jacob so wholesome <3
3:14 didn’t mention missing the bus and half the tour lol
Who saw jaidenanimations  one
i know this is kinda late but does anyone know the song that plays at the end of this video
11:14 AHEMMMM....good for you man
She animated this story for HALF A YEAR
You forgot to mention jaidons huge obsession
Why did Sanji look at his own merch tho?
Haha money go boing
Bro I just watched Jaiden’s vid THEN IT RECOMMENDED ME THIS YO YOUTUBE MUST BE SPYING ON ME
IS NO ONE QUESTIONING 11:14
Sanji-san
Did anyone see the kiss before day 5
Yokohama is my hometown that I really love. Thank you for visiting!
go to 11:14 an slow the video  down
11:50 GYATT
The funniest part of the "fan" interaction is that Jacob does look a lot like Sanji
Ummmmmmm did anyone else notice the make out session in the montage with JAN at 11:14-11:15?
9:43  you beter NOT
About the tier list of McDonald. As a Swedish person I FULLY am on your side about sweden being in S-tier!!!👍👍
Wassup sanji
Damn 11:14 is something... interesting
I stan your gift giving... <3
11:14 Never in a million years would I have imagined jan and jacob full on making out for a fraction of second BAHAHHAHAA
As a Norwegian i must ask, why is it a C-tier
Sanji san
5:43 This lil mermaid is named Ariel to all of those who don't know and Alph, she's part of a kid's cartoon.
9:37
Jaiden said that z kid called you "sanji san". Anyway you have done plenty things in japan
Sanji? XDD
11:14 slay
I am here from Jaidens video and i couldn't understand stand why she was hyping up Jacob so much and now i am here and he's a total G for all his friends
You started your channel 2 years before i was born
I FOUND IT >:D
This was fantastic love all the products
Sanji San 😂😂😂😂
11:14  I’m glad stoned asf me is good pausing the vid amazing job at hiding this lol
Didn't even know you went with Jaiden.
bro went out with jaiden
How come he never mentioned that Jaiden was there to
Why is no one talking about when he kissed Jan?
me
11:14 had to put this on the slowest speed and look again, I’m deeply concerned
When your making all the money and it all is because of friends  What do you do next?  You make the greatest lootboxes ever curated and become a god of gifts
11:15  well I just saw something
Americans lose weight in Japan because Tokyo is simply goat walkable city
I watched this vid when it first came out, loved it, and then rewatched after Jaiden’s vid came out. And loved it even more!
"It's not to flex my financial incompetence." I mean, atleast hes not trying to brag and flex the entire video about him having a ton of money. He know's he doesnt know what to do with the money so he's just like "Yeah, i'll spend it on more plushies."
This just jadens video all over
Alpharad I just wanna say that the language you use for the days it was not Japanese it was Mandarin just saying.
Jacob. That reversable Shanks jacket is the coolest thing I've ever seen and I need one! I am in Japan right now! Do you happen to remember where you found it? Edit: Never mind. Found the jacket. Can't afford it. 😭Really glad I don't have a credit card, you are MadLad Alpharad!
I need to know how much Jayden spent on those Chikawas 😂
My bro seen u at lax
@ohara 15:28 moment
"The local hell of LAX" yeaaaaaaahhhhh.....
12:31 NEZUKO CHANNN
11:13
11:14 waht tf is this real
Also yo, Jaiden looks much more lively and outgoing in person compared to her avatar. I did not expect her to have tattoos
Yo go to Germany next please
I can't believe u didn't add Jaiden after she added u so much
SANJI SAN UR REALLY LUCKY TO BE JAIDEN’S BEST FRIEND ☺️😃😃😃
11:14 WWWHHHAAAAAT😂
Where's Jaden
DID HE SERIOUSLY GET POINTCROW THE NAUGHTY NAUGHTY?
ONG THE DUOLINGO THING FOR ME IS EXACTLY THE SAME I CAN AND CANT READ IT AT THE SAME TIME 😭
Naw bro said groceries to RULE 34 ITSELF
The unboxing your gifts part of the video had me crying for minutes.
I love hxh ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
im not cringe anymore
aha that end made me smile like an idiot, I love seeing people happy.
Lmao the zoro lost in thr thumbnail
First video I watch from this channel and whoa was it a wholesome roller coaster :) ❤
2:18 Ohhh what a nice towel!!!
22:13 OMORI MOUSEPAD???
12:31 HOLY **** ITS THE DEMON SLAYER PLANE
*me waiting for Jacob to mention that Jaiden was there*
"Sanji san!"  -that one legendary kid.
I feel you with the "feeling like a husk of a person" and asking yourself "am I happy?" Thank you for being real and vulnerable. You seem confident and want to get out of life everything you can. I'd want to talk with you and hang out for a bit. You're inspiring. I'm happy for you being happy and having had this great opportunity!  Also, you and Jaiden both reignited my love for Pokémon with your videos!
wheres jaiden
jacob's massive quantity of gifts reminds me of my best friend and i. we both just sometimes see things that we know the other likes, and buy it, and by the time we see each other next we've got like an entire sack of stuff for each other. our parents might be a little put out for how much of their money we spent on each other before we had our own 😅
11:14 we’re not skipping past this buddy…..
How did he keep track of all the gifts for all of his friends?
Jaden did the same video but a managed
Did you go with jaden
Didn't Jaiden come with
Can someone please explain to me why Pokémon world being in Hawaii next year is I’ll timed, I don’t understand😅
I spend ¥100 on a claw machine for a Kirby plushie in china
You’ve been to Scotland!?
It took a whole seven minutes before we got a proper shot of Jaiden in this video. For the guy who created an entire reward show to make fun of how often he uses her as clickbait, that is some impressive restraint.
2:46 Hold up WHA-
Huh, there's a weird spike in viewer attention around 11:14, I wonder what  it ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Canada has Double Big Mac as well....
Lol i watched jayden version and today i get urs on yt 😭😭
Here from Jaiden's video <3 7:39 - I would definitely buy that bomber jacket <3 I wear that style as my spring coat when it isn't pouring rain. 7:57 - I always thought they were 3D rendered and I'm so interested that someone actually makes them! 9:36 - Would've bought a lot of RE merch!  Also as a fellow nerd if I ever go to Japan I am planning to mail a bunch of things I bought to my parents house since some might be bulkier i.e. a giant bulbasaur plushie because he's my starter <3.
What a nice Video, good to know you had a great time.
alpharad what are you hiding from that one frame? care to explain????????
cheekowa
Once again back to this video after Jaiden's and this is insane. The amount of spending he did to get his friends gifts is insane.
seven minutes in and he finally mentions that jaiden was with him after he was present in ALL of her video lmao
encontrando o Luba nos cantinhos tal qual um easter egg
The whole video, I could only think: “FOR ALL OF JAIDEN’S VIDEO, SHE KEPT TALKING ABOUT HOW A GREAT FRIEND HE IS, AND HOW MUCH FUN SHE HAD WITH HIM, BUT IN HIS VIDEO HE JUST KEEPS TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND BARELY ABOUT JAIDEN…” But, when I saw the end, it made up for it lol. (I don’t mean to be rude or anything, this was mainly to be funny)
Watching this and Jaiden’s video on the Japan trip left me with some bittersweet feelings. It’s awesome to see what a fun and amazing time you guys had, but at the same time, it made me realize that I don’t really have any friends who share my interests that I’d be able to do stuff like this with, even if I had the time and money to do so.
Que Alpharad considere el McDonalds de México como Tier A me hace sentir orgulloso y no debería...
Your spending is telling me how much i need to save for pokemon merch (I might go to Japan for like a day this year and I'm a pokemon fan, good combo for my mental health bad for my bank account)
1M!?
Chef’s kiss it makes my day to see a happiness like this. Thank you
Jaiden and Alpharad maxed out my respect stats
":o SANJI SAN"
Your McD tier list... Scotland is in the UK.. so you have the Union Jack AND the Scottish flag? If you mean England then you need to use the white flag with the red cross on it.
I wish I could be in the tornament
Alpharads video: thank you everyone this trip changed my life and how I see the world and my career    Jaiden: CHIKOWA MY OBSESSION AHHHHHHHHHH
Just saw Jaidens video so I came to rewatch this one, and omg, yall share 1 braincell 😭
Little kid from Jaden animations : 'Sanji San"
go to 11:14 theres a surprise
Oi sanji-san
Glad to see the video is comletely different from Jaiden's.
he only came because of Jaidens Pokemon plushie vid so thank her
Wait why does he- 11:14
Who wAs u makin out with?     Not to be rude, i understand this is a very personal question and if no one actualy anwers the question i understand fully
woah 11:14
priorities list: -groceries -p*rn -hatsune miku tickets   he got the right priorities
1:44 oh hey we have those in Canada
14:55 what happened in hawaii to make it ill timed?
😋😋😋 the food
Truly an inspiration Sanji-San I hope to not be a husk of a person as soon as possible and maybe start a YouTube channel I at least want to make an impact on the world also great video I hope to meet you someday if that’s even possible but that’s probably too much to ask for.
☆▪︎》CHIIKAWA《▪︎☆
The McDonald's thing is much more common than you think
Maybe happiness is the journey we've been through
holy crap that thumbnail has everything I love one piece and Pokémon
Jacob I saw that clip of you kissing I ain’t stupid😂😂😂😂😂
Seeing this first in animated form in Jaiden's video to seeing it in real life is wild.
11:14 💀💀💀💀💀
You want with Jayden
as a huge fan of mha anime fan I WANTED TO GO TO JAPAN but i knew it wouldnt happen cuz japan is harder than english i even struggles grammar
i just know it was a trip getting through customs
11:14 damn
Halve way through the video and he's already down about 5 grand and counting I think. Damn 😮.
so your poor now... I'm sorry for your loss
I love how she was just in the background of the burger clip 😭
Robertidk twin
the fact that jaiden video got more views 4.1M lol and this was made 6 months ago ... lol
11:14 we see a kiss lol wtf
んー…日本語字幕も付けて欲しかった(￣∇￣)
Buy a million items 👍  Have Pokémon give 1% of what you buy for free 🤬
I watched jaidens vid 2😂
I love the fact that I’ll never live the luxury of YouTubers or Japanese people just do to the fact I spawned in America low income family, like what’s the point anymore more bro, watching others live my dream only for me to struggle in life 😞🔫
Me:Watches jaidens video  Me:Watches your video This is outrageous why hasn’t he mentioned jaiden yet.
ultraman is in this video😮
Jacob, you're awesome ❤
I laughed so hard when Jaiden said in her video that a tiny child called you Sanji. Grab a cigarette and you could be his 4th brother 😂
Thank you for your video, thank for sharing an adventure that some or many of couldn't afford. Must confess the end scene made me cry and i don't know why 🥲
11:14 ....... No comment
11:14 I saw that 🫵🤭
SAN JI-SAN XD
I got a Pokémon ad while watching this
a seven 7 that has P**n?!! your right it is the holy land
11:16 was bro making out with someone 😭😨
11:14 Anyone one else see that? 🤨📸 🤨📸🤨📸🤨📸🤨📸🤨📸🤨📸
2:45 to WHAT!?
That whole ending part is so fuckin cool, between knowing which Pokémon and series are people's favorite, plus little offshoot stuff that pertains to that specific person. Seems like Jacob is a really solid friend
Jaiden's got some sick ink on her, didn't know she was sleeved up like that.
jaiden did go with u right? 😶‍🌫
Goddamn, that's more than I made in 2023... Went to good stuff though!
Very curious why aussie maccas is top tier with Japan.
Aww jaiden doing the lil dance
I want to do this too- but i'm poor 😢
Jaiden brought me here 🤣
Sanji san
9:37 Your here cause of the Jaiden Vid   This is where it all started
Random thought where the black friends if he doesn’t have one pick me 😂
I'm kind of surprised Jaiden wasn't clickbaited, since she literally won that award lol.
3:16
Ain't no way bro can comfortably spend 1000 dollars on plushies🤯🤓
The SUS Miku body pillow
you do realize that at some point we're going to need to see that picture you took of Jaiden in the Chiikawa section of the merch store . . . you know the one
What is that Jaiden to n the background of McDonald's 😮
See, that montage of all his friends opening and geeking out over their gifts is EXACTLY what I want to be able to do with my money.  I want to be able to make my friends happy and support people and just... make someone's day a bit brighter.  Ngl I started crying at that part 😭
Alternate title: alpharad goes to Japan and spends 二百五十八万二千六百三円 on merch
SEVEN.TEEN.THOUSAND?????
That's honestly impressive. The ending of the video was actually nice. Im not a fan, idk who you are and i came from Jaiden's video just now but that was nice seeing the ending
Y’all living the Pokémon dream. So jelly.
2:44 they have it all, groceries, p### even Pokémon cards
_.  _ /.   O :.:-:.:Amogus not chickowa
_.     _😊
Everything at the end for real made me tear up, that's so sweet. I struggle with remember what people like/dislike/interests/etc. But to see how much you know what your friends likes and their reactions made me smile X3 Edit: also good lord I have the mindset that me spending over 100$ in a month is alot for fun stuff XD seeing that total you spent on merch made me curl up into a void.
WHERE IS JADEN
I adore you ❤❤ came after Jayden’s video (because I thought you were super cute and sexy no shame in that sanji-san😉🤣) but after seeing Jayden’s version, I thought you were and incredible person, and now seeing your version I think you are even more amazing ❤.
15:52 song name?
Alpharad is everything I aspire to be, happy, and a fantastic friend
Bro, forgot about Jaiden animations
please tell me everyone noticed 11:14... please tell me im not crazy
i love how no ones gonna talk about alpharad getting and making out with his friend in 11:14
Also came here from Jaiden! 2
11:14  oh wow 😉
already saw jaidens video loser, step it up editors. BYE!
I did 👇
Meeeeee
Seeing all your friends with their gifts made me tear up just because this is one of my biggest goals. To be able to give back to my friends after all the years of knowing them and just thank them for always being there for me
Thks jaiden gonna subscribe 🎉
26:12 I look respectfully
As someone who struggles to voice any sort of emotion or anything personal/intimate, I also use gift-giving as a way to communicate love and appreciation to those close to me. I can assure you there is no greater feeling than seeing their reactions.
I know I am so late to the party, and I'll be honest, I knew nothing about this guy prior to this.    But that ending of all your friends opening the gifts you send them.. man that almost made me cry a little! Gift giving is my least used love language, but there is something so special about giving something to someone, that makes them react like this! Just pure joy and excitement! The fact that so much of the stuff you bought, was actually personal gifts for your friends.. It's just so incredibly wholesome and heartwarming 🧡
Jaiden: I was there with Alpharad! We did stuff together! Alpharad: I was here and did this!
I love how in the background it just 卩乇尺丂ㄖ几卂 丂ㄖㄩ几ᗪㄒ尺卂匚Ҝ Those soundtracks are bangers tho
The double Big Mac is here in the US too. It’s awesome
Thank you for this amazing videos this is also a great thing that Pokémon did
I know somebody else has probably said this, but I just wanted to say thanks for how much care both you, and Jaiden took with One Piece spoilers.
The way I started to tear up at 3am seeing Jacob discussing his personal struggles, to him Genuinely being grateful to everyone   Wow
11:14 sooooo this is how i found out jacob is not straight
That kid calling you Sanji makes a lot of sense now lol
I am literally crying seeing everyone get nice gifts. I would really be happy to get stuff from someone who knows you so well.  Tip for next time, instead of buying luggage you can buy boxes and ship them back home. May take longer but would be a cheaper option.
bro why is jayden so bedazzled at 12:42 in the vid
11:14 alpharad needs help
i was so exited and happy when his friends were opening the gifts that i forgot to cry (i probably wouldnt be able to anywyas) but i love this so much
Jaiden brought me here. Thank you, Jaiden.
Ur living the fuckinf dream dude…spending copious amounts of money on ur friends is like the best thing ever
who here freeze framed at 11:14?
11:14 what did I just see
👈 “Sanji-San” :0
11:15 ??
Upon rewatching I never noticed all the one piece merch... I didn't have an unhealthy obsession with one piece at the time so that makes sense
Hanging out cuz Jaiden said to come over.  There's something hilarious about watching Jaiden's video first. Then seeing it in "Live Action".  Very cool, never thought either of You were flexing.
Why didint you youse transleter
Japanese conbini’s are one of the things I want to go to if I make it to Japan
bro this vid is so good, like jaindens vid and like the ending is amazing
11:14 good for you bro enjoy the "karaoke"
11:14 crazy😃
Hi sanji
I think I saw your friend's video on this same situation lmao
Why Jaiden is not mentioned? :(
You like Seven Eleven, but I wish we had Family Mart here in the USA. Seriously, my sister had to stop me from going into every Family Mart I saw
I went to Japan and I’m glad that you got to experience the same joy that I had from just how good the 7 Eleven is there
How else saw the statute that looked lebron and went you are my sunshine
Sanji is a character from One Piece and there are letters at the end of peoples names for example san chan etc
11:14 uhm okey wtf
You are with Jaiden
Yoooo its my dream to go japan one day...just gotta learn the language first
I need a hyper fixation like this
absolutely no one talking about him kissing jan NO ONE REALLY?? WHAT
biggest kiss in anime history 11:14
11:14 💀
Do Jacob and Jaiden not realize that they are in love with each other?? Just date and get it over with.
so wholesome great vid
WhERE YOU MeNMTION Jaiden  Jaden mentioned you like almost every single time
My wallet had empathetic pains for yours. X-D Absolutely amazing video. <3
7:34  "its really just a cry for help 😅"
11:14 ok?
11:14, I see you 🎉🎉🎉
Am I going to have to go into a deep depression to become a successful content creator 😭. Glad you're happy alpharad, I've been following since the beginning
Came here from jaiden!
He went to the double book itself.
The noise I made when I saw the Pikmin stuff. I need it all
He really do look like Sanji tho
I am asking this because reasons, are you in any way/shape/form related to Troydan? No hate just a genuine question.
Did you go with Jaiden too?
Jayden animations really helped you for  isn't it changed in which actually sent you to Japan with her
Please tell me Jaiden WASNT your accountant 😭
Glad im not the only one who scrolled back to check on the short segment with men kissing.
11:14 Ayo..
Yeah
Sanji-san
The Jaiden jumpscare 😭😭😭😭
Glad you had Fun Sanji
11:14 it speaks for itself
"I am a helpless consumer designed to buy products." I can relate to that.
First time watching you and DEFINITELY NOT pleased. Norway McDonald’s at the bottom? Wtf we literally have sweet potato fries. Shame on you.
I’m extremely disappointed by the fact you took a plane to Osaka the tokaido Shinkansen is cheaper and basically faster than flying (the trip itself is slower but with all the time lost in traveling to and from the airports and waiting at the airports with security checks and stuff it’s actually faster to take the Shinkansen)
6:54 If Jaiden is your accountant… after seeing her videos -> that’s on you
the date this came out on....
11:11 played at 0.25 speed ( WTF DID I JUST WITNESS )💀💀💀💀
Did everyone here come here after watching Jaidens trip ( including me )
You really look like sanji
WHO WAS HE MAKING OUT WITH????
Scotland at A for food is valid (from a scottish person)
SANJI!
17 THOUSAND DOLLARS    How much merch did you get that needs 8 SUITCASES and bad bois look big as well damn   19:46
Honestly suprised he didnt mention persona with going tk shibuya
October 6-9  3:34
The fact that the majority of the things you bought was for your friends was extremely awesome to see.  I did a similar thing but with a smaller budget and Gundam instead of Pokemon.     Protip, next time just go to a post office and mail the things over to the US.  Its probably cheaper than buying the luggage and paying the extra fee for it.  Also its easier to walk around without 8 suitcases and bags.
10:40 Also you look like Sanji
As an Australian seeing your teir list scares me for ever trying other maccers now
I need to stop watching. The merch is to wondrous for me. I am not financially sound or strong enough for this video.
Good thing she picked you
With how plainly she draws herself I always forget how gorgeous Jaiden is
11:14 bro thought we wouldn’t notice tisk tisk tisk
🖐️ me. The video was very sweet and fun to watch
i thought this was a video about japan 😭😭❤🥺
Literally teared up from the last 10 mins. What a great video.
For anyone who wanted the math, he confirmed he spent $4550.17 within his first week... this doesn't even consider how much he spent during the rest of his trip. Bless his accountant 😱🤣
Copyrighted
Hello sanji san
WHAT ABOUT JAYDEN ANIMATIONS
6:15 Those bus seats have the most 80's/90's arcade carpet design I've ever seen on a seat in the modern day.
how has no one mention the clip of Jacob just making out at a karaoke bar HOW
10:20  I came back to this video just to cross reference the “Sanji-san” moment! lol
The gifts at the end, had me smiling through the whole section. it was really wholesome. 😊
oh my god its sanji
Help. Envy consumes me
SEEING JAIDEN WITH THE CHIKUA I- U CAN SEE THE OBSESSION IN HER EYES 9:37
I guess bro can pull
Bro called Jaiden an accountant
Jaiden, come back with that umbrella! 🏃‍♂️
Is it weird that Canada has a double BigMac and America doesn't?
WHY DOES THE KISS LOOK SO AGRESSIVE--?! (ALSO IS IT STAGED IM GEUINLEY CONFUSED..---?!) 11:14
This is so sweet 😭😭😭
im late but no one is talking about 11:13 ?
Well pointing fingers at someone is rude especially in Japan where traditional etiquette are greatly valued
I’m noticing he isn’t mentioning missing the first bus…
I think at some point I would just ship myself the stuff
We have double big Mac in Canada
How did you find your friendgroup? I want one like yours!
Can't believe that I am the only one that knows how to play pokemon
2:45    that came out of nowhere👁👄👁
Jaden was with you
Whenever you feel empty that's God trying to reach you. Dude, He's the only one that is able to give us full eternally sustainable life. He came down in the flesh as Christ Jesus to save us from the sin curse we ourselves have created; that keeps us from eternal life and himself, the divine Creator Lord and King over all. Only because He loves us did He sacrifice himself on the cross for us. And He concurred the grave for us. He is awesome! I pray you one day believe in him and trust him with your life. If you doubt His existence then just look at the raw nature of Earth and how perfect and complex it is. and how each part of any normal living being works together and that one can't function without the other, that the being can only have body part that it already has. Does that come from a random brainless process that comes from nowhere? From an explosion out of nothing, something that only destroys and never makes anything? If you say that God doesn't exist because there's no obsolete law then why does every single person agree that stealing is wrong. There's absolute good because you know that absolute evil exists. There's always an opposite of something that exists. Also try to watch a thunderstorm or looking at a sunset and say that there isn't no one that made that. Structures we have never make themselves, so what sense does it make to say that nature made itself?
BDS 🇵🇸
15:30 No way man just invited the one piece guy.
Never heard of this guy came because of Jaiden
@7:28 Jacoooob noooooo XD thats too muchhh i feel for your wallet
✨💙🤩💙✨
11:14 WHAT
Porn? 🤨🤨🤨😈😈😈
11:14 lol???
he does look like Sanji if you squint and use some imagination.
Maybe that kid pointed at you and said Sanji-san because you look like him? Perhaps that’s a coincidence? Other than that I have no other reason why you would do it.
At 7:00, I killed that exact Pokémon in Shield.
Sadly no giant monsters attacked Japan while on your trip
Just as you started mentioning McDonalds I got a wendys add come on
There is one tiny frame OF TWO  GUYS KISSING AT 11:14, completely unexpected
so sweet! made me cry
The Double big mac was a thing for a while here in the states you could only order it through the app
Japanese boy saw his first blonde man and said automatically thought Sanji-san✨
I love the persona music in the background
The fact that you're actually happy and enjoying life really reflects in your content. I love just getting to see you do whatever and be whoever you want, that's kind of the point of your job, just to make people smile. And what better way to achieve that than by dedicating an entire quarter of your video to other people.
Everyone getting their gifts at the end was super wholesome 🥹
I was wondering why you barely talked about Jaiden being with you but noticed the 5 month difference between your vids, so I am assuming spoilers lol
Huh... does he even mention that he came on this trip with Jaiden? Like, the only reason I'm even watching this video, is because Jaiden mentioned in her video, that he made a video about his experience, but so far the only mention of her has been this reference at 6:57, where he introduces her as his "accountant", which I know is a joke, but like... wow. Considering how much Jaiden was complimenting him about how nice he is at the end of her video, alongside the constant mentions of him (since they went on this trip *together*), to see this video not even mention her at all (at least, nearly 10 minutes in)... just wow. I think I remember why I stopped watching lmao EDIT: Ah, well her name IS at the top of the description of the video... that nobody reads. She mentions him by name before minute ONE in her video, and he doesn't even name drop her until 9:37 in his...
The fact that alpharad curated the most perfect japanese merch boxes for all of his friends is making me cry, that is the sweetest thing ever
11:14 💀
My first meal in Japan was McDonald's too, but that was because the airport was shutting down and most things were closing. Its a miracle the JR clerk asked if anyone was trying to make the last train to Osaka and pulled us out of line.
Did no one except me notice the 1 frame in 11:14 or is it just normal so no one talks about it?
I love how almost all the clips of pointcrow are just him talking about how he can’t show what he got😭
No one is talking about the kiss at 11:14 😅
Flashbacks from the checkpoint music
Ah ah ah, we ain't going to fly pass the fact that you kissed someone while in karaoke and wasted like a b*tch
Dude the second half of this video is so wholesome, god bless your mind heart Jacob Alpharad
Did you think I’d not noticed you used Jaden animations thumbnail
Found out about this channel from Jaiden. I am definitely subscribing. I love your videos, my guy!
Imagine making your friends' day like that! Actually inspiring and heart melting.
I wish I could do this for warhammer
4:20 Was he referring to Perrin or Ogerpon?
I was expecting a cool trip video, got a cool trip + spending video, but then ended with a heartfelt(!) friend reaction video. GOD DAMN this was an amazing first video to watch from you. 😮❤
Is that sanji san
jjk fans after hearing shibuya  0_0
Poor wallet lol
11:14 is crazy
Why am I crying so hard?!! This ending was so wholesome!!!!
I think you forgot something here you know the thing Jaden was taken the chico C on her video said it affected her Mental Health
11:14 …wtf
Being happy is cool, love that for you.
Konichiwa! Sanji-san!
You deserve Jaden she was there, she’s the reason I’m over here
The amount of thought, time and money that went into buying and assorting each gift that was perfect for each person really warmed my heart, you can really see how much these people mean to him
You haven't seen nothing of 7 11.... Go to hong kong
you kept some stuff for yourself, right?
2:04 duolingo ate one of sukuna's finger 💀
I feel terrible for pointing this out, but I got that exact Dragonair plushie for my boyfriend at 1/3 of that price from a local board game and hobby store.
i watched jaidens animation first😁
The cartoon bear i forgot the name of: seirusly just saying one thing about me?
THE KISS
Sanji
Sanji
At this point, Jaiden and Alpha might just make a 2 hour tour through their Pokemon merch collection and I would watch it 😂
I just realized alpha is actually Jaiden boyfriend
warning dont watch this if youre sad, poor and have no friends
Sanji san ( *ﾟAﾟ)
something before day 5....i know what i saw, did i?
WHERE IS JADIEN??!?!??!??!??!?
the ending was so wholesome! i LOVED seeing the team's reactions to their gifts!
11:14 😳
fortnite
ummm can we adress what happend at 11:14
Did you just… not clickbait Jaiden?
I have always viewed Pokemon as a huge phenomenon and to see it not only entertain and provide content to the mass, but also show that it is something of dreams. To have presented such an amazing trip to not only Alpharad but Jaiden, two fans of the franchise, is something crazy to see.
watching this video feels like watching a live action
Chikuwaa
I cry at the AMOUNT OF SPENDING but it’s not much different to my spending 😂 I just spread it throughout the day and make myself believe I am not spending 1,000 bucks in one go. But I still spent 1,000 bucks throughout the day
Why is Norway on the bottom 😢
Its kinda weird and rude that jaiden had such a spotlight for you in her video meanwhile in your video...
Can I become Jacobs friend
Dude just earned a subscrib solely cause of how much appreciation they have for their friends 😭🖤
Came here from jaiden
The double big mac is also avaliable in canada tho. Pretty sure i also got it in one of the norther states
I'm so happy you're happy!!! Seeing your friends enjoying their gifts was very heartwarming.
This is sooo cute :')
This is so cool and i think this is so good:3
I wish I had a giant snorlaxxx😢
Ppl who came frm Jayden animations 👇🏻
RealBreakingNate! 🎉
2:46 ?
2:44 TO WHAT😟
It's awesome to see both perspectives now. There's even more content now!
That’s so amazing you gave everyone gifts. That’s so many people. You’re so awesome!! ⭐️
If there's one takeaway I have, it's that working in entertainment as a career sounds like hell.
(6:57) 9:37 You finally mention Jaiden. 🤯😅
Were there any recording of the E ve concert? Jaiden's video said you went there
So this was months ago..
11:13 we saw what u did hon :D
11:14 alpharad got greedy
11:14
Congratulations, you now know how Connor feels about Ironmouse's own addiction to Cinnamoroll.
11:14 I want a 10 episode explanation for this, I must believe it's true
Can i just say i loved your entire adventure.. 😊 and appreciate the mvc2 Music
Didnt realize that jaiden was tatted.
11:15 uh so yeah I don’t know what to do and or say help me 😂😂😂
7-11 is always incredible wdym
I saw that split second thing after the Karaoke; nice
Alpharad is secretly Sanji
Me
I saw what you did You kiss a guy an now you are gay
Holy shit seeing this say October in the video when i in April reminded me that this was 5 months ago. (I came here after Jaiden’s video that’s why it surprised me.)
the 1 frame of him and jan kissing really makes the video
why you kiss Jan 🤨
Me
23:51  i felt that my guy
Huh, impressive. Founded your Video from the relative on JaidenAnimation's video.
WoW look at this addiction. Isn’t it BEAUTIFUL? - “Sanji-San”
11:13 did anyone else see that 🤨🤨
Egg on a McDouble sou is fire ngl 🔥🤤
I wanna be like this guy
I live in Honolulu and I can’t wait to go the Pokémon Finals:D
What about Jaiden
He does look like Sanji!
nothing more and nothing less 11:14
I got literal goosebumps from watching all your friends open their gifts and be genuinely grateful and excited for them all! Gift giving is my love language too, and this made my day! I hope to have amazing friends to spoil like that one day!
I love the Persona background music!
As someone who loves anime and this nerdy stuff as much as you... I would. Buy just as much if i had that much spending power
What would I do next!!! Try to find your fuc*** job!!!! 😂
Chikawa...... CHIKAWAAAAAA
13:12  💀💀
11:14 😟🤔🤨
I don't know most of those people at the end, but everyone's delight made me smile. This seems like a good YouTuber.
tf did he get to pointcrow man  lol
just 11:14 thats all
19:06
11:14 WAIT
7eleven in Japan is next level. I miss it so much
16:28 I ACTUALLY SHOUTED "I REMEMBER THAT VIDEO"
Me waiting for him to say Jaiden was there :3
11:14 Bro was not slick with the edits lol
Aight On the McDonald's tier list I've only eaten McDonald's in 2 countries Canada and America I can say, Canadian McDonald's, while mostly the same, has 1 thing going for it, our barbecue sauce is LEAGUES better than the American stuff That is all I would complain about them being on the same tier but I haven't tried any other McDonald's and it might make the most sense given how the others taste lol
Try mcdonalds in France trust
Came from Jaiden because I was curious to hear Alpharad's perspective on their trip, but 5 minuets in and I'll I've heard was "I". "I was invited", "I went to McDonalds", blah blah blah. It's like he forgot he went with a friend. Not worth the other 22 minutes of my life.
Really gross how we normalized rich people buying several thousand $ worth of merch and stupid sht while people are homeless out there. "Haha I have no self control I'm so quirky" eat sht
11:14 sobing rn 😭‼️
“It’s really just to cry for help-“ *insert ad*
❤❤
IM IN HAWAII
You did good alpha just keep working hard
Just curious. How much total did Jayden and Alpharad spend on this trip?! I know it alot! But it would be cool if somebody did the calculations. I'm not the best at math. Lol 😅🧮 But yeah also the conversion from total Japanese Yen ¥ to US Dollars $. It would be cool to know! Since someday I want to save up and travel to Japan in the future as well! It's been my dream since forever. And I kinda wanna a guess/estimate on how much things usually cost there. Since I don't have a crazy amount of money? But I will still get souvenirs. But not like 7 suitcases. That's an insane amount of money! Lol. I'd prob get like 1 or 2 extra suitcases or bags. 🛩🥰🎒🛍💰💴
Pokémon be like, how dare you promote other franchises then us
Here post-Jaiden vid!!!
alpharad went to the netherlands once?!
*Di Caprio pointing whistling gif* 11:14 👀🙈❤
Bro spent my 2 weeks of work in 1 shopping spree 😭 but i know he worked hard to be there good for him
I dont like how he only focuses on himself always saying "I" when explaining, knowing that he was with Jaiden the whole trip. he shouldve say some of 'we" or "our" since its not all his luggage but also jaidens. am i right?
Omg I came here after Jaiden video and knew he gifted many things to his friends but I legit teared up seeing their reaction to the stuff they got. Amazing friend 😊
sweden Mc is s tier?????! why explain
Clicked simply because I saw GOJO and Geto being cute
i just saw this mf kiss a guy. im out
I came her from jaiden, i jumped when i saw that this video is 5 months old, well animation dose take way longer than this, still a great video 😅😅😅😅!
golteik🕷🕸💓
With how little spending you probably did for the 10 years I think this amount is alright, just unfortunate that you had to buy extra luggage just for the items you bought since you were overseas.
i got a Pokémon ad on this video ....
Everyone here after Jaidens Video but WHO WAS HE KISSING AT 11:13 ???
Watching this late, but seeing someone that makes me happy, be happy, is incredible
leafeon
Dayum jaiden😍
Sanji san ✨👁️👄👁️✨
So basically, be prepared to spend a king's ransom when you visit Japan.
Sanji-san 🤡🤡
sanji san!!!
Fortnite made sense thank you alpharad
WHY DID I NEVER NOTICED JAN AND JACOB KISSING 11:14
Bro spent more then 10K on merch, I wish I had that much self control.
As someone who is not in the One Piece fandom I gotta ask.. what's so special about episode 1072? Is it the number and if yes, what's special about this number? Or does it just have some really epic and important content?
Again.... How are yall not In debt
I ship Jaiden and Jacob get it JJ ill see myself to the door
Oh Hi, you are that Sanji
1:30. Glad you like our maccas, mate. Cheers c-word.
At the start of the video. It looks like it says. Total order: US $9282.48
Watching Jacobs and Jaidens videos are so different but similar at the same time😂
Bruh why didn’t you mention Jaiden
Wait is he spending all that money at each store?! I THIUGHT THAT WAS THE MONEY HE SPENT THE WHOLE TIME COMBINED
Who else saw the painting of naked Miku on the side of the wall.   👇🏻
I'd love to see the view stats before and after Jaiden posted her video on this
11:14 AYO, WHAT FRAME DID I JUST SAW!?!? 🤣🤣🤣
If you pause at this time 11:14 you will see something cursed
you went with jeiden anamations right
Me watching Jaiden's video: Wow, what a fun trip - how the heck can she afford all that? I'm glad she's so happy. I could never, though.  Me watching Jacob's video: GOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALS.    Seriously, I love giving my friends and family curated gifts so much. And I can never do it because I don't have any money (and, uh, also not many friends right now.) I would absolutely LOVE an experience like this - to have a fun trip and then share the joy by sending huge boxes of stuff I know the people in my life will absolutely love?? Jacob, life? YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT.
So you sold everything and made 10 times the money???
11:13 naah we saw it fam :D
10:23 Sanji-san🤩
Jacob didn’t mention Jaiden getting kicked out of the capsule machine store even though he witnessed it live. Also didn’t blame Jaiden for their being late for the first bus of the trip.  What a great friend, not throwing her under the bus like that.
🍞
Came here straight after watching Jaidens vid lol
alternitive title : grown man almost goes in to bankruptcy from anime in japan and gets called sanji by a little asian kid.
7:00 hey there's jaiden
Came here from Jaiden!
Sanji had fun 😂
you literally look like sanji 😭
Also, this is what Jaden meant by you doing a video on your trip to Japan From the way that you said, you guys broke your wallet, but from the way that Jaden was telling the story, it sounds like you guys had to go to a long shark for a loan
You got scammed
ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALPHA AND JAN OR NOT??????
実もセブンイレブンで納税できます
I 100% think Jacob is a great guy. I don't know him and from the videos he comes off as funny. But the real moments he had with friends... he's a real one. The ending made me so happy. I love Jaiden and Jacob's adventures. The difference between heir videos is hilarious. Glad you had fun!
So wholesome🫶
They have double big mcs in Indiana too
11:14 sure alpharad, sure.
That kiss did not look fake
11:14 SIR, WHAT, WHAT, SIR
Got so emotional watching this! Biggest congrats to you Jacob! You deserve all the happiness there is!
How was Jaiden’s chikowa obsession like how much chikowa did she buy
Love your content man, revisiting from after I watched Jaiden's video lol. love the different perspectives and I adore the kind of friendship the two of you have being represented in media as an AroAce person who is extremely tired of people demanding certain requirements for relationships. It's very refreshing having people with actual realistic relationships who actively discourages fans from being weird about labels  also I can't believe the first time I watched this I didn't notice the one frame of jan and jacob kissing at 11:14 what kind of a fan am i
Alpharad I would be very surprised if you got a chiikawa toy and hand craft a bunch of items to make this chiikawa have the Mihawk clothing for Jaiden
Wait. You mean you AREN'T Sanji-san? (Joke aside, I think I'd be pretty happy to be mistaken for an anime character.)
Imma start saving up now, I'll be there in 20 years! My friends are gonna LOVE all the stuff!
did drunk jacob kiss another man?
You know your a good creator when ur sub count surpasses your average view count
they invested into you and they got their moneys worth
11:14 NOT HIM MAKING OUT WITH SOMEONE
3:26 lol that's a middle finger
How was it to see Jaden crest a whole new obsession right before your eyes?
You would probably like the ace and sanji spin-offs
Hey Sanji
DID YOU GO TO A LAWSON CONVENIENCE STORE? THEY'RE THE BESTTTT!!
Dutch McDonalds being at the bottom of the tierlist is very fair. Do not go to McDonalds here
Wait, what did he say 2:45
Say Jacob, I hear that you got a chuckle going through Japan with Jaiden. Do you consider her as your trip buddy now? Because her animations show she needs to go on more trips with you.
NHK WORLD ONLINE is Japan's PBS, their website has free lessons to learn Japanese, written and spoken.  Its a great source of different news and other interesting topics. Enjoy!
11:14 ayo
11:14 is crazy
Zoro getting lost on the thumbnail is just hilarious 😂
SAAANJJII
@alpharad can you just like be my friend or at least 1v1 me in pokemon/smash or something.
From 20:50 onwards, I saw the finest menagerie of nerds this world has to offer. I don't know who these people are and barely understand what they are talking about. Receiving all these stuff would not make me happy. But I can see that they are happy for some reason. I got warm and fuzzy just from looking at those excited dorks doing their thing.
11:14 HUH?
Bro at 2:51 when I saw Giyuu I just yelled so loud (And yes I'm a simp for Giyuu :D)
Guys what happpened at 11:14  Like hold up. did my eyes deceive me
im so confused at 1:31 you have the UK AND Scotland in there... is the UK flag for England or Wales at this point?!? since it should also include Scotland
uh jacob why are you kissing a dude🤨
Thanks for rating irish mcdonalds A tier because i live in Ireland
Jaiden animations sent me
11:14
I’m the same way, bro. If I’m eatin’, my friends eatin’.
tanaka acoomodities fits right in
I didnt even know Jaiden was gonna have a video on this
You dident mention maiden🙄🫣
Ok now im curius how fucking much money DId you spend😅
Pokémon paradise
22:13 OMORI⁉️‼️‼️ WHO IS THIS I NEED TO KNOW
11:14- HM I wonder what that KARAOKE NIGHT a was like
9:40 the face of a woman who innocently has no idea what is coming
So glad you and Jaiden got to experience what looks like your best (and most expensive) trip together!
Jacob not only spent HUNDREDS and possibly THOUSANDS on his friends, but bro also PERSONALISED their gifts
Sanji-San
was it fun watching Jaiden slowly lose her mind over a derp cat.
how did you have australia at an s for maccas but you hadn't heard of a double big mac until now!! we have them too lol
OMG JUST CRYING AT THE END😭
Holy crap that place it decked out in pokemon 💥                          😮
Imagine getting sponsored by Pokemon themselves
Wow that last bit with all your friends was beautiful
Wait, why was the announcement that next year's championship would take place in Hawaii badly timed? What happened in Hawaii?
Jacob, when I grow up I wanna be just like you
omg jaiden is the cutest in this. she has the best fits
11:14 in case you were wondering.
11:14 blud tried to sneak that in lmao
Came here after Jaiden and the end here is so cool! You are a great friend and seeing your generosity is super inspiring. Thank you +
nah norway mc on c tier
Came here after watching Jaiden’s Chikowa obsession
Who was Jacob making out with? 😂
Your story doesn't match Jaiden?  And is it just me or is at least half of your fanbase from Jaiden?
Sanji san
Sanjisan
Sanji san😂
I was watching Jaiden's POV of this and this vid was right next to it XD!
I watched this before jaidens vid
Ive never been on this channel before but cool thanks Jaiden Oh right shanji moment lol
Top 10 reasons why I’m moving to Japan I will buy so much stuff that I won’t be able to bring to all home if I need to get on a plane  It looks cool
11:14 is weird
Here from Jaiden's video. Amazing trip! Thank you for sharing it with us and for showing all of the happy faces from your gift giving! Also, I appreciate you being real with us; the grind is real, take care of yourself.  Also, loving the Wildcard channel!
12:30 8:15 Hiroshima......yeah i'm not taking that
Hawaii is the only state in America that has a good 7/11. People who have tried it will agree
This isn't a dig but a genuine question. If British and Scottish McDonald's are both B teir what does the British flag signify? I do like knowing Scottish McDonald's made the list in its own right. But does Jacob mean English McDonald's or all the parts of the UK and Scottish was so good it got on the list twice? 🤔
11:14 are you gay?
Love you alph, keep it up❤
SANJI-SAN! ❤
Came here from jaiden 😊
Wait I love how jaiden included Jacob on her story and was so kind describing him and Jacob just forgot Jaiden and left her out like to apologize to Jaiden 4 him💀💀💀 👇🏽
My mouth watered at the food part.
Saw this before pretty but watching it again
11:14 no one is going to talk about this?
I WAS HYPERFIXATED ON THIS VIDEO AS SOON AS YOU SAID SPLATOON!   I may have an incurable obsession with that game
11:14 you ain't leaving the accusations
"So we did this thing and it was great. And later we did this thing and was also great!"
19:45 the way my jaw dropped
5:07 it connects so much i can even see the stanley parable in the tree
This is wholesome
I love how it’s implied that he got pointcrow hentai
Omg I legit teared up when everyone started showing their gifts 🥹
I"M A PIKMIN FAN :D
I mean if i didn’t  have to pay for the airplane nor the hotel then i guess I would have lost it too
im gonna be real with you, the last part of the video made me cry.
New viewer-- friend of mine got me to watch Jaiden's video but I was so amused by your mentions in that one I had to see your side of it and I'm glad I did. I appreciated the moment of just being serious and breaking down your struggles as a content creator on top of your enjoyment of the trip. It makes me want to go so bad but the most relatable thing was this heartwarming ending where you bought your friends merch that made them absolutely giddy. I find that so relatable I'd love nothing more than to dote on my closest friends so I think i'm more envious over that than the trip as a whole lmao. Great vid.
11:14 did anybody notice?
so sanji, you liked japan?
You do actually kinda look like him!
Someone would definitely have to hold my card and moneys. Because I would be spending a fortune on Pokémon and Nintendo stuff too! Mostly Pokemon 😁  I wonder how many pokestops and gyms and different pokemons? You will see on Pokémon Go while at Japen!?
Came here from Jaiden, left with a very happy and positive outlook on life in general.  Thanks Alpharad. Hope I can be a good friend like you're not only trying, but succeeding in being. :)
7/11 corn is crazy
That's cool
we dont deserve you jacob, have a happy easter!
0:30 we all got that one job man 😭
I came from Jaiden and realized it was months ago and now I wish I was in Japan lol
commenting cause I watched this before Jaidens video
Alternative title: "Pokemon Invited Us to TOKYO! (An Anime & Manga Fans Heaven)
"SANJI-SAN"
Watching this video I've never felt so happy for somebody else it's a nice feeling❤😊
why is no one talking about that clip at 11:14 xD
How tf do you keep getting crazy as hell sponsors.
jaiden finally made a video about this just to see that this means that the video was made FIVE MONTHSAGO which also could mean that Jaiden is still gone STILL
Sanji
11:14  MHMM….!
Not gonna lie this is like my dream this is like one of my goals in life, I want to be that person who buy stuff they know their friends like and see how happy they're, I've always been more happy about giving than receiving. Seeing stuff like this and people like you makes me so happy, like, just look at your friends so happy by the gifts you gave them ❤
i cryed at the end srs
Did you mention Jaiden? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
This is just about the other 4th most relatable video on YouTube ever.
Dude wtf he doesn’t even acknowledge the fact that Jaiden was there, but when she made her video he was in practically every shot
It’s giving ✨consumerism ✨
11:14 🤨 What cha doin’ bud?
I cant afford groceries this week and i like watching these videos and living vicariously through someone with some disposable income. Actual serotonin boost, BUY ALL THE THINGS :D
I wish there is a JJK reference. (Im gonna keep believing)  Edit-I SAW MEGUMI FOR 2 SECONDS Edit 2- THERE MORE IN CHAPTER 8.
sanjji chan!
12:50 look at Jaiden’s little drawing 🤩
Yup I came here after jaiden animations video
Wow you’re a pretty cool dude. Thank you for existing 😁
The end was SO WHOLESOME D:
Jaiden is just a *tinyy* bit late
Strange that you don’t have double Big Macs in the US yet they’re just across the border in Canada.
Hi sanji
5:20 I have this exact same plushie
Aight I sub that ending was wholesome
Sanji San
Was that Jan?
🤨11:14
17000$ that's some people's salary for a year...
Jacob and Jaden in Japan: 💵💵💵💵💵🔫
11:14 I did not just witness that
7/11 where I live is always overrun with druggies xD
1:53 Hi Jaiden
Not “seven eleven”  ✨Seven Eleven ✨
SANJI-SAAAANNNN!!! Lmao
2:46 💀
I’m sorry…who did Jacob kiss!? 11:14
9:37 This. This right here was the beginning *of the end.*
11:14… Jacob what was that?
Sounds like a lot of fun I genuinely am a little jealous I love Pokemon so much
11:14
Imagine getting called sanji san 💀
Not gonna lie if I was in his position I'd also buy gifts for all my friends. Gift giving is so much fun
9:55 LMAO
I met these two in LAX before the trip. It was cool. 👍 (I forgor to comment earlier)
7:42   Bro I never realized how inked Jaden animations is. Not in a bad way bc her tats look so cool but I’m shook
Those last five minutes got mr weepinh and om not upset
It’s not that odd to want to try McDonalds in other countries. The Netherlands does a tropical Milkshake that the United Kingdom (where I live) does not do. Why go somewhere else if not to do new things you cannot do at home.
2:46 Da hell
I love Chinese and Japanese food! But,it always gives me diarrhea,but I still love it.
You can ask in the arcades to make it easier for you after a few tries... there's that.
Taste like dr pepper...but japanese.
11:14 AYO
jaiden rocks those damn no sleeve shirts like jjk maki absolyte mother
I love how throughout the entire video, he uses lots of Pokemon music, especially my favorite one, National Park from HeartGold and SoulSilver... Keep up the amazing content!😊
I love eterna city tune!! Your music taste is good!!
you are such an amazing friend, and im happy for you that you got to go on this amazing trip
Where is Jaiden
11.14 bro was kissing a man
lmao
i thought yours looked really good until you put the original next to it
if your into ranking chain food in country's, I have heard that McDonalds in Germany is very good.
As someone who studied abroad in Japan for a year, their merch game is too strong. Those guys really know how to merchandise the fuck out of a brand with stuff you ACTUALLY want to buy.....It is a blessing and a curse.
who came from jaiden video?
The ones who come from jaiden 👇🏼
Mexican 7-eleven is good too also better then US
The McDonald's near where I am has Double Big Macs and when I found out I immediately got one. My gluttony knows no bounds
I'm 5 months late but holy arceus, my wallet isn't that big 😅😂
11:14 Slow it to .25…You’re welcome.
The ending, watch to the end❤❤❤
Someone collab these Japanese pokemon into one video
Seeing Jaiden's Chiikawa brain rot in Jacob's POV was everything. 😭 👋ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ
I *knew* Jaiden's trip sounded familiar...
who else went back to 11:14 to check if what you saw was correct xD
Me to buddy me to
the fact that you just so happened to be in japan for 1072 is crazy
Knocking the wind out of me with 2014 being 10 years ago wasn't expected but I'm very glad you had a good time!!!
All the friend’s reactions to the gifts was so wholesome 🥺
PIKMIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What happened at 11:14 bro
Saw this before  Jaiden but appreciate both creators
Me
Fyrus is so lucky, cyndaquil as a gift <3
Came here from Jaiden
As a norwegian i 100% agree on the McDonald's tier list. It tastes fucking shit
Here after laughing with Jaiden's video, now I'm CRYING of how much of a nice person you are 😭😭😭😭
Im not gonna lie dude I had a big ole grin the whole time people were opening thier gifts that was so awsome of ya ❤
Honestly you are the best type of rich.  You help those who helped you make it and I respect the hell out of you for it.  If I ever hit it big, I would absolutely do the same for my close circle.
11:14 alpharad what did you do
Didnt expect to see ohara in this video
1:31 HOW DARE YOU PUT NORWAY AT C TIER AND SWEDEN AT S TIER-  THEIR BASICALLY THE SAME!!!👁👄👁😡 Also yes im saying this as a Norwegian, that hates people who say that Norway and Sweden is the same :)
Bruh ross didnt even do the SUPER pose smh
We have double big macs in Canada too surprisingly!
Sanji lmao
The way you said 7-eleven hit me in the feels. Like I want to go to Japan now only for that now....and for their anime merch
Does anyone know where I can get the mug at 10:24 ?
Did anyone see the cut im 11:15
11:14 Anyone explaining?
11:14 I don't it this is the right time
Bro why am i crying, I want to be in your position one day. I love giving things out, and I am planning my Japanese trip[ with my fiance. Happy life man <3
That Japanese kid was right, he does kinda look like Sanji 😂
wait where is jaiden😢
I love how Jaidens new video about her japan experience led people to this video. Also damn you really can't underestimate how long it is to animate.
the ending is so cute i cried
Yay love it when you two catch up especially when it’s in Japan
TSA looking at these 8 suitcases like 🤨
Qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvgnk,.
Jjjjjjaaaaaaaiiiiiuddddddaaaaannnnn
I hear so many persona songs in the background and it’s driving me insane (I fucking love persona)
You indeed do look like Sanji! XD
not gonna lie Jaiden brought me here
Is no one really talking about the 11:14 minute mark?!?!?💀💀💀💀
omfg it finally happened. jan and jacob fucking kissed  edit: why is literally no one talking bout this in the comment section ??
11:14 *Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme*
1:30 australia for the win, baby!
Behold the cravers of sin the cravers of greed
I was grinning ear to ear at the final section. Seeing everyone's joy at getting gifts.... lovely. As someone who loves giving gifts to my friends, that is the biggest baller move ever
I will always be grateful for all my friends even more from now on
all the personalized gifts was so freaking adorable
I didn't realise I was coming from Jaden's video to cry over how wholesome this was. You're a great guy
That was really sweet at the end bro but damn that’s a lot of money
We could all be so lucky to have a friend as thoughtful as Jacob. 😊
11:14  HOLY SHAT😨
Random japanese kid: Sanji-san * w *
11:14 Enemies to lovers…😊
Netherlands C? If u try it in the city of groningen especilly westerhaven there is it dellicius.
alpharad lost 11,000$
11:14...WHAT.
11:14 YO???
I LOVE THE ENDING OF THE VID <33
11:14 sus
Watched this video when it came out, great. Completely forgot about it. Time passes, Jaiden’s video drops… Here we are again
26:56 do it
Can you send me a birmie plush
It’s been 5 years since the Shibuya incident
11:14 favourite part
11:14   Yes I yep totally not the first time this happened yep no I need help.
what do you mean you decided to bring an extra bag. wasnt it Jaidens idea?
1:46 Where were you when the double Big Mac was being advertised at McDonald's in America because they had it before many times
私は本当にそのような素晴らしいビデオを期待していませんでした。サムネイルを見たとき、「ああ、これはジェイデンが話していたビデオだ、見に行くよ、サムネイルのアニメーションに違いない...」と思った。アニメーションの代わりに、私はアルフレッドの側から日本の非常に興味深い話を得ました。(Alphreadのスペルを間違えたらごめんなさい)
Is it me or does Jaiden have tattoos [Not to offend but like.]
What do you mean we?
Jaiden's video: Problem? I don't have a problem, you have a problem, this is who I am!!! Jacob's video: ...this is a cry for help from my poor wallet.
Is this the first time Pokemon has sponsored a YouTube video!?
I knew this video because of jaiden
you did good okay :)
I always forget jaiden has full sleeves, but also im so glad that you were able to reevaluate where youre at and realize things you truly care about and cherish. Heres to continued amazing growth!
McDonald’s in America has had the double Big Mac just not for long. In Texas, we had it for two weeks before it disappeared.
Casually playing genshin impact as I listen to this, only to snap my neck 90 degrees at 7:10 when I hear my favorite soundtrack from pokemon x and y
SUP SANJI
Mee
11:14 😳😳😳
11:14 who was Jacob kissing here lol
Came here expecting to hear about Jaiden as well cause she for sure mentioned you a lot. Came here watched the first 3 minutes, left disappointed by the lack of him mentioning that Jaiden had invited him to this trip. Shame to be honest
Oh, jazzy Retro Rifle shirt my man :D
11:14 woah bro calm down
Jacob, I know this is a bit out of place but following your short rant around 19:15 I just wanted to let you know how much your content has meant to me. I started watching you in highschool and now am in college still binging your content. I am so beyond happy that you are in a good place now and want you to know that you mean the absolute world to me and I hope life keeps going your way. We quickly met in 2022(?) at momocon and I look forward to hopefully meeting you randomly again one day to properly thank you :)
This is a good video to watch while building a lego
Any Jojo fans? I wonder what a jojo store looks like there
dawg i started sobbing seeing how many things he bought for his friends knowing them well
It's kind of sad that Alpha's video came out months ago and Jaiden's just dropped a few days ago and that's reason why I'm watching his video now. Bc of Jaiden. I'm not even subbed to her or Alpha's channel
Came here from Jaiden's video and was amused at how different the recounting of events were.  Jaiden's felt like a buddy trip, while if I watched this video first, I'd have assumed she met up with him a few times, but that he mostly did things on his own.
11:14 WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT LMAO
11:13 I SAW THAT
11:14, who was that....?
IS EVERYONE JUST NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT 11:14 ??!! NO ? ALRIGHTY THEN
Oh! Sanji san!
11:14 JACOB KISSED A MAN, LETS GOOOO
19:46 lol hey Jacob, wanna pay my medical bills
11:14 bro what the hell💀
Came after Jaiden, but ive never seen Jacob until now, and man is so handsomely attractive at least for me lol ❤
that's amazing how much he got for all his friends :o
The ending was so wholesome. Man Jacob did it, he put the work in and became a successful content creator. That part of the video with the KH music while he explained his personal life was so good, Jacob really his S tier Sanji level expect with W rizz.
2:07  ik all but the  nihongo jouzu
Who’s here after watching Jaiden’s video
Why is Jacob kinda…🫣
Jacob, if you need someone with Financial Expertise, we, the viewers, likely cannot help. If you need a fellow impulse buyer who's got self-control that is willing to judge you for your purposes, Pokémon LITERALLY sent you the tickets to Japan. They knew what was going to happen, just not the extent of it.
11:14 DANG
11:14
The compilation at the end was so wholesome ^u^
Hello sanji-san
I genuinely cried watching this, it's so heartwarming ❤ I felt so happy for all of your friends, I hope to have a friend like you someday or be like you
I normally don't comment on YouTube videos, but: thank you. You saying that you realized chasing your career doesn't bring you happiness struck a cord with me, I think I needed to hear that. So cheers mate, glad to hear you had a breakthrough in regards to your mental health :)
So no one else caught Jan and Jacob making out at 11:13 and slowed it down to 0.25 speed? No? Just me? Okay cool.
L bozo, get skill diffed(jk, hope you fell better soon jacob)
Nah, i skip the sponsorships but this one is the only one that i am interested in, i also saw Jaiden's vid
SANJI
we just gonna ignore the fact that he was making out with someone for a split sec okay then
Why does Alpharad not say '"we" when he actually traveled with Jaiden the whole time?
11:14 WHOA THERE SEDDLE DOWN
Ngl, in this video with the hair, you actually look a little bit like sanji naturally
2:44 💀💀 was NOT expecting that 😂
Cool video, though I wish you hadn't used the Lord's name in such a way. Anytime I see a YouTuber I know make a video about visiting Japan, I always keep on the lookout for if they mention Godzilla in any form. No such luck this time, lol.
came here after Jaiden, and my god I hope I can go to Japan and buy all of the stuffs <3
I am so happy that youre finally happy. And to give tocall your friends, if more people were like you, this world would be so much better. Cheers mate
Watched this 5 months ago, came back after Jaiden's video😂
Jacob is such an insane gift giver qwq
wheres jaiden-
Merch overload. "High quality merchandise" is a term I'm now repulsed by.
5:41 That little plushie in the corner is definitely not a foreshadowing of anything else going forward, right?
11:14 jacob's Kissing a guy
Bro at 11:14 stop it and I saw Jacob and someone else I don’t khow kissing
That way that he forgot to tell us about jaydeen at the start
Who is he making out with at drink karaoke? 11:14
I would buy all the fuecoco plushies every single one
As someone who’s biggest love language is gift giving the last part of this video makes me so happy!!
I lived in japan from when I was 3 to when I was 7, and seven eleven (along with Coco Ichibanya) were my happy  places.
jaiden's video: anime jacob's video: netflix adaptation
I'm new and this is my first vid here.    I have Zero idea Who all the people mentioned are.
I live in japan
Alpharad: *opens up about his struggles in being a content creator and burnout* Jaiden: CHIIKAWAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
aussie maccas is s tier? feel so honoured rn
I came here from Jaiden animations video and if I were in Japan I would be homeless from spending all on pokemon splatoon and hatsune miku stuff
I actually cried while watching this
11:50 my favorite quote of this entire video
The gift compilation made me tear up, that happy
im glad you had such an amazing time, its a little weird coming from Jaiden's video and her talking about "we" the hole time and for most of this video you make it sound like you went on this trip (event thing) alone with "I" in every contacts of everything. Just feels a little weird glad you had fun
I will tell anime its pur weakness
2:45 to what, alpharad
I’m happy that he is happy bro got me crying uhh that must be weird to say 😔
❤ love this jaiden and u had fun
17:59 ei, Emirchu and Daidus!
the persona 5 music at the start makes the beginning of the video much more enjoyable great choice on music
sanji-san
LOL you do look like Sanji
…How much money did you and Jaiden have? I’m both impressed and concerned
14:19 1072 😏
Yh I watched jaidens vid to and it’s so funny how u got called sanji 😭
Hey Sanji i Love your videos
I came here after Jayden😅🤚
i could never go to Japan....i am horrible at decision making and dont make enough money to indulge myself  someday....someday ill fulfill the weeb dream....
Honestly, this trip defines what I want to be if I were ever a full time content creator. Take the biggest and best trip of my life and spend the money I've made all on the friends that helped me get to where I would be. Truly an incredible friend, you are, Alpha. Though this sounds probably pretty parasocial, sorry 'bout that.
You made out with Jan!!
dude is the japanese merch version of santa clause
11:14 💀
Just came from Jaiden’s pov, ready for another 30 minutes of that white bear
Who else came from Jaiden Animations's video??
Sanji-San
Aww. That ending was so wholesome. 🥰 But I think I would probably do the same thing (hopefully). I love getting gifts for people, and I try my hardest to get things I know they'll like. I really liked seeing everyones reactions to what you got for them. That was a good ending to the whole adventure.
I'm only here because of  jaiden Where's jaiden?
the fact the chapter you read at the time the anime version came out today
subscribed.... favorite ending ever
Jaiden said you took a picture of her obsession with chikuwa..... PLEASE SHOW IT
👍
I just watched Jaiden’s video and now am watching this.
11:14
Sonja_son
your basically the pokemon professor giving all your friends their first pokemon 😭❤️
First video I’m watching but this is so awesome!  And you gave great stuff to your friends! That shows how much they meant to you! 😊
this is definitely the most heartwarming yet goated youtube video ive ever seen dude keep making people happy!
Who came from Jaiden animations
so glad you got to have fun, and be able to bring so much joy to all your friends as well the amount of joy and excitement in their voices at the end there is so sweet
ummm we not gonna talk about the quick frame 11:14!?
does he mention jaiden
The montage of your friends at the end was so wholesome.
Well, I just want to thank you and Jaiden for stimulating Japan's economy.
We need an explanation for him making out with his guy friend
11:14😘
people who were sent here by Jaiden animations                              👇
i dont get how people can remember more than 2 peoples favorite multiple things like its basically a superpower to me
11:14 need I say more
This video makes me cry every time
This episode was an emotional rollercoaster
1:31 im extremely happy to see that you put Sweden on a teir -from a simple swed
I like the giving stuff
Why was Hawaii ill timed?
"The amount of time that you work is proportional to the amount you make." ...Bro that's almost every job on earth
When is Jaiden mentioned?
Did u say p0rn😭😭
I love that trans flag in the background.
Chiikawa
This made me tear up a little.
nmjuuuuuuuuuuu why is the Netherlands c tier D:
that detail in the end is pretty alpha.... guess you could say.... it could even be pretty Alphard
WHO WAS THAT AT THE END-
11:14 hol' up, alpharad, what the actual fuck are you doing during those 5 frames of video
oh my i just watched jaidens, and i didnt realize  it took like 5 month to animate... wow
I came here from jaiden telling me about you and bro she didn’t even put in the title i just had to look for the thumbnail and hope for the best 😭
This video brought me an overwhelming amount of joy, and I don’t know why
11:14he kis te men
i can only like this once. youtube, fix pls
Hey sanji nice job keeping Jaden in order.😅
Wait why was the Hawaii thing ill-timed? I'm out of the loop.
I just had to come back and rewatch this after seeing Jaiden's video!!
my cheeks hurt from smiling so much
Millionaire complaining about feeling like everyone else feels 🙄
11:14 the fact I jumped around like oh my god oh my god oh my god that is so cute and silly and goofy and little goober like
The last part hit harder than i expected, being thankful about all your friendships through your decade long journey made me realize how little I do to show my appreciation towards my own friends, I dont know if appropriate to say but thank you man for making me realize there is something to life that people should care for more that doesnt get enough attention nowadays.
Said aloud “if I ever went to Japan the Bayonetta store would ruin me financially” RIGHT when this video started to play the Jubileus theme and it felt like a jumpscare lmao
Bro uploaded his video 5 months before Jaiden
Pikmin!? PIKMIN!? *PIKMIN!?*
5:25 Me: Oh, Poppy Playtime is in there. WAIT, POPPY PLAYTIME?!
Thank you.  that ending with what you did for everyone was amazing.
"baby in car"
11:14 who’s this???😂
15:53 who’s this???😂
one of my biggest dreams is to visit japan but i am NOT immune to fun items. my entire bank account will be gone before i ever leave
I just found this video after watching Jaidens and I have to say I love your video. I know this came out 5 months ago but I just wanted to say I really appreciated your mental health piece. It always makes me feel happy when creators remove the stigma and talk about mental health. Thank you.
what a time to have spending money and being taken to japan. I kinda wonder if the pokemon orchestra is ever streamed or recorded.
11:14 😏
21:03 dude their reactions are so cute!!! 😭 This is why I love giving people things their reactions are my EVERYTHING 😭😭😭😭🫶🫶
14:49 GAY 😧🫵😧
Wheres jadien
11:14 put on playback speed at 0.25 and look
I just came here from jaiden's video
7-Eleven😐 7-Eleven in Japan 😆🤪😱😃
All the reaction of Alphard's friends was really heartwarming I had an unlucky incident (twice) and i was feeling like the must unfortunate person in existence for a long time but this whole video brought genuine joy to me Thanks to pokemon for letting them have a life reflecting vacation ❤
You have good calve muscles 😅😊
Holy shit there is a whooper siting cutie
GO TO A MAID CAFE NEXT TIME!!!
10:19 Could someone please explain to me what's the difference between SAN JI-SAN and SANJI-SAN?
The stores selling extra large suitcases in Japan must make some _serious_ bank thanks to all the fandom stores
No no no, I expect your house to look like an _exquisite_ souvenir shop
13:12 the poster on the left 💀
Bro really understatement Jaiden's hyperfixation hahahaha
WHAT DID THE MCDONALDS IN THE NETHERLANDS DO TO YOU (I AM DUTCH AND CRYING)
11:14 I JUST WATCHED THE CHANEL FOR THE FIRST TIME, CAN SOME ONE EXPLAIN!?
Giant joltick bought by Jaiden is funny
Me
Sanji-San!
11:14
When ever u go to McDonald’s France in tours or Versalles or something I can’t remember which one it was 😂 they have plastic French fry cups, plastic drinking cups and I forgot if they had plates too but in the our in troquedero my dyslexia won’t let me write it correctly but where that giant arche thingy Is at theirs a McDonald’s near it and to go to the restroom u have to ask for a coin thingy bc apparently they back in the day you had to pay in order to enter a stall in the bathroom 💀
im here from jaiden video
11:14 Am I the only one who caught that split second kiss? Cause I see no one talking about it🤣
OMG! the cat ears really worked!!
The kh music mid way is perfect; alph ur so precious 🥰
made me trust in humanity again. the last session is epic. sub just for that
right side of the screen at 5:42 is giving Jaiden flashbacks
The second half made me tear up, ngl. Really happy for you and your friends, man.
Hey can we talk about the really good indirect life coaching advice starting at 15:40 for a sec? I'm so proud of you man :)
THE SANJI-SAN STORY IS REAL *cue soyjak point + mouth gap*
no I am not crying because of the ending   ITS SO WHOLESOME WHAT THE FUCK
Kobe really said 😀
I saw that
Aussie here, i can confirm the Australian MacDonalds here are the best.
11:14 the start of many fan fictions 😂
Jacob gave us emotional whip lash half way through the video. (Let's just say... If I wasn't outside. I would be ugly crying right.😭)   Good to hear that your trip in Japan was great. Also will watch the rest of the video at hope, because the last few minutes are giving the good kind of emotional damage.😭
When is the Teal Mask Video?
Are we all ignoring Alpha and Jan making out at the end of Day 4?
この人は日本を良く見せるのがうまい
I love that ending.
yo at 11:14 in this video NICE bro got IN IT!! (i love this video btw)
11:14 Oh my!
The kid had never seen a blond white guy, and thought of younas an anime character IMMIDATLY. So cute. >XD 10:10 I'm not great with gift giving. It's not my love language. I wish it was, because seeing how happy they were made me cry. You did. You are amazing, dude.
I love that 11:13 is the most replayed in the video 🤣🤣🤣
Love how Jaiden just dropped her Japan vid. Amazing!
.
It's kinda sad that jaiden talked about Jacob a lot, and he barely talked about her..
Funny Jaden says Jacob's name like 60 times by 8 min in. Meanwhile Jacob.............
im guessing this video is getting a second wind bc of jaiden's lmao
I skipped thru the video and landed in the sanji-san part 😭😭😭
Happy for you Jacob :)
Watching this after Jaiden's video is the best.
se nota que japon es un lugar magico
That whole gift opening segment was so wholesome I wish I was rich and had friends so I could do the same thing 😭
as someone who is a wageslave but somehow ended up studying japanese economics for 4 years including one year there, just enjoy the country. bring a lot of money, it will be worth it, but i've been on my 6th vacation there 2023, rented a car in hokkaido and just went nuts exploring. Japan never ends. Start early. Also learn moonrunes, it's so worth it. The Japanese are the best people on this rotten planet I have ever met.
9:36 this hits a lil different after jaiden's video lol
11:15 oooo saucy
Dude started playing Tanaka’s famous commodities at shibuya lol
Sanji
I have banette brain rot
11:13 who u kissing? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I live for the little kid that saw you and said "Sanji-San!"
Por what in 7-11???!!!!
What was that at 11:14?? 🧐🧐🧐
AH~~~ no Taiwan on the Mc Donalds list. Sob...
I love how you have persona 5 day time soundtrack playing *totally will also be listing to that song when I'm in Japan *
This video feel soo different to watch now that the Jaiden version come out 😂😂
11:14
You are awesome Alpharad. I hope life is treating you well. I love ya man, keep up the great work ^^
Second time i saw this and noticed he made out with a guy haha 😂❤
nice video sanji-san
WHERE'S JAYDEN?
WHERE IS JAYDEN?
There needs to be a video about the Pokémon wing of y'all's house one day.
11:14    you're welcome
I can't judge at all. Don't ask how much holes my debit card due to Yu-gi-oh!         WOW THAT LAST PART. ... And I can understand it, in December of last year I almost was unable to pay for some of the essentials because I gave a present to my best friends. ... Although that was the most expensive time I have given gifts, the most important will always be that time one of my best friends I guy that I have known on that time for a year, I knew that didn't have the best childhood due to his parents, was having a bad time due to work and toxic family and didn't have money to hop on to play Yugioh. I decided to gift him my first ever Yugioh Deck Phantasm Spiral which I had for 2 years and loved alongside some of his favorite cards. I still remember what he said when I gave it to him and he had it on his hands. "Sorry I don't know how to react, I'm not used to receiving gifts".
15:44 that got emotional rq😭
Watching his friends loose their s--t over the gifts probably gave him the biggest feeling of joy
got here through Jaiden's video, and damn, I always just saw you as another decent YouTuber outside of my periphery  but now, hella respect  you're a good guy
Wait is the double big mac really not in america? Odd.. it's in Canada
15:30 broooooooo!!!!! It’s OHARA
Oh man, I loved the montage at the end. So uplifting. ❤️
?holdup did anyone else see that small frame at 11:13
Alphaclaus c:
9:37 This hits REALLY DIFFERENT now that we know Jaiden's side of the story...
Here after watching Jaidens video :]
wholesome video👍👌🗿
You are a great friend Jaiden was right ❤
i like how jacob and jaiden both say how little self control jacob has and the sheer amount of money spent but then drops the heartfelt bombshell that is jacob actually getting personal gifts for all his friends 🥺🥺🥺
Idk how u and maiden managed to afford this much stuff 😂
What an amazing video
Seeing the lady with the Yakuza arm tatts follow him around kinda gave me "bear chase skier" flashbacks.
interesting it was JADEN that was invited and brought himmmm along with HER. This video was all "I" "I" "I" and hers she included him, and what they did together, and the whole start of this if you didnt come from HER video, makes it look like he went on this alone...so odd....
Just watched Jaidens video urs is great to
Okay, intervention-I work in finance-spending is fine if it's part of your budget. Plan your expenses. Include needs, savings, and fun stuff...then there is no guilt for spending on your fav merch.
Seeing all your friends reactions is so wholesome and cute 🥺💞💞💞💞 really made me smile today
Who is here after jadiens  video
Wait 11:14 What Was Going On There???? 🤨
i just want you to know i came from jaiden. i LOVE your video. i have been super unhappy the last few months. the end of your video is incredible. not only have i had a enormous smile watching it but i cried the whole time watching people open your gifts <3
you should find the comment i left on jaidens video (i just finished it)
It's Sanji san!
I buy a lot of stuff too, so you're not alone, lol.
11:14
7:00 Jaiden has tattoos?!   Probably not that what I should be  paying attention to.   But oh well.
bruh why'd you hate the netherlands' mcdonalds :(
why is the Scottish flag and the union jack on the same teirlist Scotland is in the uk
at 3 million subs, and 5 months late (thanks jaiden) this is the first time ive ever watched your video or came across your channel. I think its safe to say after watching this to the end- i will be back for more!
Animation takes a long time - Jaiden's video about this same trip just came out.
11:14 WHAT DID U DO??
Dude Scotland is in the UK 😭 for the tier list you can do England flag and Scotland flag (bc I'm assuming u didn't go to Ireland or Wales) or you can just do the union jack with no extra Scotland flag!
POV: Jaiden brought you here
Finally someone else who recognizes how adorable Ogerpon is and how much she should be protected!
Come to Italy sometimes!
that ending literally brought tears to my eyes, it’s so sweet (what really got me was the delivery of “my goat, my son”
Lol I Just Realized It Took 5 Months After You To Make Jaiden's Video
Japan is Australia-tier with McDonalds because they use the same beef.
I love seeing everyone happy including you and Jaiden
That little clip cut of Jaiden being one of the things in your life making you happy right now was really sweet
Just came to say: "Hi Sanji-san!" 😁
Supimpa
1:30 I KNEW YOU WHERE IN SCOTLAND THAT ONE TIME I KNEW I WASNT SEEING THINGS!!!
Its addiction i wish i could have with out having a heartattack crunching numbers on having a place to live or anime.......i would pick anime 😂
dude u never mentionned jaiden was with u until half-way through and i was so confused when she showed up
I bet you’ve seen enough chiikawa to last a life time. (courtesy of Jaden😂)
didnt even know who alpharad was untill the jaden video, this was probably one of the most wholesome things iv seen in a long time, subbed :)
you never take a bot jaiden
Casually just menchens Porn.
Obligatory “here from Jaiden” comment  But seriously, everyone needs a friend like you, Jacob 😭
14:51 thank god I live in hawaii
Jaiden has uploaded. You know what this means :3
And LUCKY👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺
I only came here because of the other video
I'm coming from Jaiden's video and I just realized this was uploaded 5 MONTHS AGO my god Jaiden worked sooo hard on her video we don't deserve herrrr You're okay too I guess Jacos
You are a great friend to theses guys, im glad you and jaiden enjoyed the trip
i was thinking what's the need to spend any money on worthless anime jank ... 8:46 ... i need that Tingle. period.
12:36 that shot of Jaiden goes hard The last part of everyone just having a blast opening the gifts is so wholesome.
Dude, your generosity is insane, bro! I'm glad your friends enjoyed all the swag.
Came from Jaiden
I was sent here by @JaidenAnimations. I already know and have spoilers... Cant wait to see this side of it. lol
I feel bad for Jaiden.
love the videos
Did he just say 711 sells PO-
11:14 not what I was expecting
Well that's a pokemon fan right there And 1 pc😊
22:13 Me: *Thinks everything is cute and wholesome* *sees the thing on the girls table* Me: ''Holy shi-''
Jaiden is soo beautiful 😍,  lol sorry had to point it out 7:50 😅
7:30 oh... Oh God! he casually spent close to my social security benefits CARD LIMIT. I had to plan when I would be able to buy my Moonlight Luxe mattress and time it just right to stay in the clear. This guy is just allowed to spend 2 grand from a singular store!
Why is Jayden not here sadge
Japan is crack for fans
Chiikawa.
I would have done the exact same thing for my friends- little do they know i remember every single thing they like since i met them in highschool and if i get the chance i WILL get them the best gift i can. My longest friend ive had is gonna get something super special soon and im so excited to give it to her.
I Just came from Jaden channel after watching her Japan trip experience i love how she mentioned about you two traveling having different experience it was great video and she suggested to watch your video i was expecting to get to see story of this trip from your perspective how you two struggle but got sadly disappointed that you didn't mention Jaden not even once like you came alone in trip (oh yea little glimpse of her in video that's all) Where in her video its you two against Japan trip. But then again its your experience 😂
11:14 jacob. Explain
Who else came back here after Jaidens video? Great to fill in the blanks
Yo at 13:12 in the video you can see a thing with a little bit of clothes
This is why they flew you out for free, they made their money back real quick 😂
you should try germany mcdonalds they have chicken wings i would put them in s tier
1:31 As a Canadian myself, i am very happy Canada is only in b teir, unless that is a bad thing, then i'm personaly offended
18:56 I aroace ship them so much.
revisiting this now that Jaiden finally posted her version.
Wsp Sanji-san
Jaiden: I went to japan with my friend Jacob, we did everything together and he is my best friend! Jacob: I went to japan and spent money.
Is it REALLY a vacation if someone else pays for it and you're focused on making content out of it instead of just being?
9:53 Iron Fist ALEXANDER!!!
straight up: literally one of the most wholesome videos I've EVER seen. Alpharad has come a long way and we'll support him all the way :D
11:14 WHAT THE F-
THE MAKEOUT SESH TF!?
Yes! More gay!  11:14
This was so unexpextingly wholesome ❤❤❤
I would take the kid calling you sanji as a great complement. Also, it's more than just being blond, I can see why the kid said it :)
WHAT NO JADEN 😭😭😭😭😭
pokemon is so smart, flying people out to japan so they not only buy all thier stuff but then they can sponsor the videos they make about the trip
Nope. The kid was right. All you need is the proper eyebrows.
Hey Sweden on top with our McDonald’s!! Go us!
You know he’s durnked as fuck at 11:14
Came here from jaiden!
Chiikawaa.
does anyone know what the name of the friend who likes swablu is!!!!!! i am swablu’s number one fan and i want to follow them if theyre a content creator!!!
This was definitely the climax to a 10-year arc
no one talking ab the end of day four??/
McD’s in France is without doubt 100% better than in the UK, though I do appreciate you put the Saltire 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 separately, but are you sure we’re really second best to Japan??   Because I know for a fact Japan is legit a whole different experience altogether, like so amazing it might as well not be named MC’D’s because it’s not even comparable.
9:40 is the face of pure joy XD
Same
Kinda nice to have a friend like you. And be able to go out like this.
Jaden just now made her video
Bro that ending part with all the people was just so adorable 😭😭
Here from the Jaiden video. Awesome video BTW.
I need to hope I win some sort of lottery because I would go into so much debt in Japan! 😅
Jacob is the friend I inspired to be
1:31 I live in Canada US McDonalds is better except they always get your order wrong.
i came here after seeing jaiden's video... dunno why i never subscribed. >_>  man, i wish i had money... and the ability to travel... and friends.
WHY IS MY NETHERLANDS IN C!!!
3:04 me
12:31 I- E-EXCUSE ME?! WHAT PLANE IS THAT, WHAT AIRLINE IS THAT, WHERE CAN I GET TICKETS I- WH-
Here from Jaiden's video. So awesome to see your perspective on everything. Your speech about mental health hit really hard for me. Keep doing what makes you happy man, there is no better feeling than the simple joy of just being happy where you are surrounded by who you love. It's amazing to see you give back to your friends too, that was really nice of you.
1:31 ohhh did you visit Sweden??? Yeah, our McDonalds is the best!  Also getting everyone all those gifts was pretty RAD of you, Alpha! 🙌
Here from Jaiden
PERSONA MUSIC PERSONA 0:45 MURSIC
It was really cool to hear the tangent about mental health and what you find important. I'm glad you kept that section in because it's something super relatable to everyone.
It’s so wholesome whatching his friends being amazed by everything I was smiling the whole time lmao
“fifty shades of fucked up” 😂
That ending compilation of gift opening was amazing <3
i cant believe sanji made a youtube video
The montage of unboxing at the end made me cry😂
Who else came here right after Jaiden Animations video realized that their trip was months ago
Coming here from Jaiden's just released video about the trip is ... the singular perspective vs Jaiden's being a joint trip perspective is trippy.
5:06 okay, the Mario haribo gummies are also in Germany  Why can’t we have them elsewhere
11:14 WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE, HM??????
No clue who this dude is but the kindness and thoughtfulness he showed to his friends is this video is super incredible. He’s truly an amazing person with a bigger heart than most people could think of. What a fucking legend.
02:19 - WHERE can I find that "Kiki's Delivery Service" merchandise
So we're unanimous agreeing to call him Sanji from now on right
wait why is mcdonalds canada so low?
Three minutes in and he still hasn’t mentioned Jaiden
Coming here from Jaiden’s vid and OH MY GOD seeing the actual numbers just makes how much you spent seem that much more ridiculous
2k = 13.225
10k yen = 66.124
I just watched Jaiden's video on this and ONLY realised this was THE POKEMON TRIP that was for JAIDEN.
from grocerys to WHAT?
9:37 "Then I stumbled upon Jaiden forming an entirely _new_ hyper-fixation." ...How little we knew. At least, not those following her Instagram.    Suuuuure... she _totally_ did not mean to steal that umbrella!
I think the best part about this video is that Jacob knew his friends so well, and his friends had such happy, raw reactions to the gifts they received. There’s nothing better than making a friend smile <3
Between the two videos of Jaiden and Jacob, I’m feeling more determined to actually try to do YouTube  Just because Jacob really feels like what I aspire to be, as a friend, as a creator, and as a person!  Mark my words, I will do my damnedest to make my mark on this platform!  (🔥w🔥)
22:46  OMORI
5 months later jaiden posted her POV lmao
22:46 OMORI JUMPSCARE wait no sorry PEAK JUMPSCARE
Sukuna Duolingo hurts me
People from jaidens video 👇
How much i wish i went to japan or had the money to buy all that stuff for me and friends
wewre is purplecliffe
2:45 that was too fast! 😂
Ppl that came from Jaiden's vid 👇
teacher: how was your break?   Alpharad: *inhales*
Time to rewatch this after watching Jaiden's video!
Who else came from Jaiden’s video? 💀 *just five months late…*
14:59 elements of harmony headass😭😭😭
whalecum aboard.  we weebs all felt the same the 1st time we landed in japan...  it is like a pilgramage to the holy land.
6:11 うんこ shirt😂💩
19:51 The TSA agents at the airport TSA: “What’s in here?” Alpha: “…” TSA: *gets a treasure trove of mini Pokémon plushies*
Am I the only one who thought of jjk season 2 when he said shibuya?
The matter of the fact is that Pokémon actually acknowledged AND endorsed this man. That’s actually pretty crazy.
Maybe the real Pokémon are the friends we made along the way
I am happy that you are happy jacob❤
I got to visit Tokyo for a school trip recently and it’s fuckin rad to see you visited the same places, makes me weirdly nostalgic & feel better for spending as much as I did 🥲
@pokemon You can send me some merch if you want 😉🥰
Also can someone tell me who's that in the teal hair? I have seen their content but I can't remember the channel so please lemme know!!
I've been binging on Pokemon Nuzlock (thanks Jaiden for my new addiction) and found this channel and many more through that. That heartfelt speech made me tear up and it was such a wholesome moment to see all his friends receiving gifts like damn boy hit us all in the feels!
Alpharad when he did smash bros was amazing
I legit feel like I learned how to edit a little with this video.
2:34 persona4 music
20:20 🥺🧑‍🍳
bro i just want pokemon cards...
this trip looked amazing lol i cant wait for the day i get to go to japan. btw are you coming to new orleans for the pokemon championship? im going to be working it. would be nice to see you.
11:14
im having a feeling ever youtuber needs a break to enjoy themselves
anyone recognize what the track at 8:16 in the video is?
If someone were to send me a bunch of stuff that so obviously showed they knew me, remembered the things I liked, and I was -streaming- it? I would NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST THE TEARS
gotta love the one cameo of pointcrow with the only thing he says being “I can’t show this on stream”
The "unique" magnimite was just happy
as someone who's stupid and dumb and also commenting 5 months later why was it ill-timed that worlds would be in hawaii the next year
"Ive done a lot of crazy things on this channel"  *shows that one clip of him about to fight a Crewmate in Pokemon*
Me watching this with my life-size eevee plush
This is one of the most wholesome alpharad videos
Jacob I just want u to know I SOBBED
That's a really nice video but I feel like we should ask Alpharad if he's doing alright. He seemed like a mix of sad and happy at the end there.  You doin' alright bud?
I wanna be that kinda friend to my friends
I hade to skip the part we’re he kissis because my mom was there the second she got devorce
THE A HAT IN TIME SONGS!!! LETS FUGEN GOOO!!!!!
1 million views? yeah you didn't spend nothing hahaha
in norway burgerking is much better thatn mcdonalds! so try that
Thanks for putting us Australians in s teir
I went to the same place
11:14 pause before playing
this is so awesome and the end was SO sweet omg
me in future
10:59 love this part for no particular reason (that’s me btw trust)
Pokemon company is smart to sponser youtubers to vgc, as they get free publicity, n well merchandise selling n promotion
Cute!
Im sorry did you kiss jack
i’ve watched this video three times now and i still can’t get over the absolutely beautiful monologue about happiness and putting yourself first. so proud of how far you’ve come, you deserve everything that you’ve built.
W Video
Everytime I rewatch the end of this video I remember how much I love Jacob and how much he’s just me ong
Nothing better!
top ten best anime endings of all time
I'm happy u found your happiness bro. Keep moving even if its hard, and always be you
i wish i got the Kuromi stand sins she's my fav charachter.🥺🥺😭😭
WWWWWWWWWWWWW
Lmfao this video cements my math when people ask me well why dont you go to Japan now and my response is im a broke bitch. I will need a minimum of $18k just to survive out there😭😭😭
the hotel floor looks like my bed
rip to your bank account
shoutout to 11:15
I love how Jacob and Jaiden just enable each others spending habits
Young alpha looks like Mr beast, am I crazy???
how did i just realize i wasn’t subscribed to Alpharad when i’ve been watching him for years 😀
HOLD ON!!! WHO DID YOU KISS AT 11:14?!?!? ᓫ(°⌑°)ǃ
I LIVE in hawaii
That last bit made me shed a tear. Utterly brilliant.
Loving that aus is the best
my brain the second i hear shibuya *JJK*
Did my man had the YouTuber O’Hara in the video
The plot twist that it was all for his friends is the most wholesome shit I've watched in a long time.
11:13 / 11:14  0.25 i feel like jacob will win the 2024 award again
The Pokemon arceus background music was so calming lol
12:51 never let this guy find muse dash….
OMG, I GOT A FORTNITE AD AT 5:06  This can't be a coincidence👀
This video is so beautiful ❤
So are we gonna ignore the fact the Pokémon challenges stayed true to his word (kissing alpha rad) 1:54
Explane what the f haoend att 11:14
Really? Maccas in Australia is S tier? ... As a resident of the country, literally why?
What has norway done to you did it not taste good
can feel the joy that you bring to your friends, so Awesome
7/11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Should he get a subscriber or one of his family members come with him to stop this bridge and he’s asking for help
wait did jacob change the video? I swear he ended it with a speech and then used his old ending?
I think purple Cliff spent more at a arcade in Japan
8:00 yours is a happy magnamite
7:40 WEED CAT ON THE BUS
It's so cute, but 17,000,000$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing video ❤
“Japan is all about the respect”
21:28 didn't know they were friends but I definitely see it
This looks like so much fun
Alpha getting mistaken for Sanji by a child is wholesome
It’s good to see someone genuinely happy with what they’re doing
can we get context for 11:14 because... Oh my...
sanji-kuns hair is so magestic
I’m surprised you were allowed to mention adult content in this video given the sponsor
tack för att du har sverige över norge på snabb-mats listan
The place where you also go into debt 8:18
But that 7 eleven was selling what now?
this is heaven😭😭
11:13
At 9:55 the Fricking Coby and Lebron James statues are racist
As a car guy 7-11 is revered
I was also there for this and also spent too much money. I recomend bringing just a carry on an extra suitcase or buying one there and foldable duffel bags
this is so wholesome im smiling so hard
Everyone yay Japan!! Alpha:FORRTNITTE
Bringing an empty suitcase for bringing back souvenirs. GENIUS!!!!! 🤯
Alternative title: Jacob singlehandedly fuels Japan's economy
..                                                                                                                                                                                                                            dam
Genuinely started tearing up at the last segment, you've really come a long way and have been a huge inspiration to me. Thank you.
The Eva pop up🥲 my heart would explode
Who were you kissing?
hey does anyone know which tea garden he went to it looks really cool and I'm planning a trip to japan
the reason i will never go to Japan if i set one foot into the Kirby merch store its over I'm glad you had a great time and the ending was so wholesome.
Zoro in the thumbnail lost
9:05 Can someone tell me what are these things supposed to be please ?
you know you can ask help at japanese arcades from the employees
Ok but what did pointcrow get
is nobody mentioning the fact that they sell p*rn in a 7/11💀💀💀💀💀💀
do you voice over your own voice
When he said shibuya flashbacks came rushing in.
8:14  Not Shibuya!
It's three months later and I'm shocked I have not seen a single comment about Jan and Alpha's date night at 11:14
no one noticing the one frame during the karaoke part where hes making out with purple cliffe?
was it just me who saw that one frame in the kareokie
Man, you made me love you by just watching this vid... and this is my first ti e watching you! 😂👍
SANJI
11:13  WHO WAS HE KISSING
I would just luv to say that one day when I start my channel and do fun and amazing things I’ll look back on this video and grow as well. Thank you Alpharad for being an amazing human!♡
I really should stop watching this video, cuz it just makes me want to hop online and empty my wallet on pokemon plushies
I lost it when I saw Jaiden with the Joltick plush  🤣
This video is so cool, when my brother went and came back from Japan, he brought gifts for me and my family  At the moment I cannot recall what my parents and sister got but I got a Japanese copy of Mario Party 4 and a bag of Field Crickets  Literally the best things ever  He even has the same name as you  He's so cool
Omg I was just like Ohara?!? As soon as I saw him 😂😂😂
Zoro is lost in thumbnail
Holy shit, it is a real fucking perspective changer to see a man spend nearly $20 Grand and decides to say "These fuckers need to know how much I love them and how much they mean to me."  I'm gonna need a good amount of time to recover from that and try to improve my fucking life lol.
11:14 You thought we wouldn't see it.
I saw realbreakingnate😅🤣
This video constitutes 25% of the US national debt
whats the song at 6:06 ?
You know what he need to go to Disney World
Heh guys… did you know I’m a quirky millennial who loves chonk doggos and I CANT UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE IN JAPAN! DERP! 😝
Anyone gonna talk about Jan and Alpha making out at kareoke? 11:13
HELP not the fan mistaking u for sanji that’s so funny 😭
I think that this man didn't bring any clothes in order to have enough space for buying all the pokemon stuff haha
why did a clip look like they were making out-💀
ITS SANJI SAN
At 15:29 was that Ohara
A kid coming up to you and calling you Sanji is TOO MUCH!! So cute!!! I see it though 🤣💕
We all know what happens in Shibuya
Oh look its the jump force guy
Take your time and love what you do!
Thank you for opening up. You're really means a lot. I'm also struggling similarly in my life.
11:14
2:03 “Domain Expansion: Malevolent Classroom”
this made me so happy!!\
S+ tier friend
Yoooo I'm pretty sure I went to that exact same Tea Garden in Yokohama! Holy shit thats sick!
That’s so cute that the kid thought you were Sanji!!
Jacob is the friend of all time
So yknow how your grandma has a really old expensive silverware collection from the 19th century that was passed down from generation to generation? Im afraid that our generation will have the same thing, but with branded silverware...
15:31 CONNOR, YEEEEEEEEES  ❤ ❤ ❤
Brooo was that ohara!!!!!????
My favorite part of the video is the duolingo bird as sukuna
"Look at this addiction, isnt it beautiful" is something i will start saying whenever somone says i don't need more plushies
Alpharad paid back the sponsorship😂
Bro completed the pokedex IRL
Australia S tier Maccas. We winning out here
18:39 does anybody know what track plays at that time stamp id appreciate it!!
YOU SAW ANRI THE CITY POP LEGEND
LOL DID HE KISS THAT DUDE
If you ever go back to Japan you can mail all that stuff you bought back to the states.
Nothing brings more joy to me than seeing someone receive a gift that they really wanted, this was so sweet!
Do you think it is ok if one of my friends went to live at Japan and don’t know japanese ?
THE WHOLESOME ENDING NEARLY MADE ME CRY
Instead of Disney taking over the world...i feel like we would all be glad and scared if Pokemon took over. God knows our wallets would perish
the ending made me cry <3 sooo cute and wholesome
Dude, beautiful much love and I understand truly about Japan
18:58 Made me emotional. It really feels awesome to find a friend to make you company through life and I'm so happy for him to have found that in Jaiden.
My turn plz God
you went to the wrong norwegain mcdonalds and the wrong sweedish one
HE DOES LOOK LIKE SANJI :0
I'm asking myself to this day that why are Chinese and Japanese kinda obsessed with Finland like we only have Moomin here 😂
kinda interesting all his friends are white lol like every single one of them
THE PERSONA MUSIC OMAIGA
alpha is literally living my dream right now, sadly i dont have 17k
alpharad = sanji irl
9:22 ish. This sums up my life pretty well. Although I don't the finances that Jacob has. edit 1: 13:50 ish yeah this also sums up the cruise trip I had recently. Which is actually pretty funny if you think about how a cruise is supposed to be about relaxation.
I came into this video expecting a running bit of overspending for merch (which was the intent), but that one two punch of the life epiphany into the heartwarming plot twist of the purchases all being gifts has absolutely made my day. You're never gonna read this but I'm just putting the energy out into the world: I am incredibly happy to hear you're in a great spot now, and the ways you cherish your friendships are inspiring.
Worst part of this video is finding out alpharad used pages
are we really not gonna talk alpharad  kissing i assume is cdawg at 11:14
This video is funny, amazing and gets me nervous all at the same time. Im going to Japan in may for 15 days and bought another suitcase just to bring for stuff im going to buy lol. and I said I was gonna bring 2000 - 3000 in spending money just incase. I know im buy stuff but your video has me convinced I might need to bring more money and a bigger suitcase for stuff im gonna buy lmao.
So true pixie
Ha ha funny rotom was. But seriously, this is probably my favourite youtube video ever.
Yes playing Pokémon TGC is a slow process of what move the player will make. But other than that spending money on Pokemon merch is bit more exciting 😂
Jaiden was your accountant you were in her poke plush unboxing
“So in other words it’s like Fortnite.” Couldn’t have said it any better LOL
i dont even like miku music that much but i wanna go to a concert the vibes (from what ive heard) are really good there
Oh my god the eva store im so incredibly jealous lol
i will now exclusivly call jacob sanji
alpharad being called sanji unironically goes hard
Wait realbreakingnate
"From groceries to Por-" Finish the sentence alpha....do it
jacobs the nicest youtuber ever! love this vid.
Just rewatched it and Jan makes the girls look so short at 6:17 and I never really realised before
Less than a minute in and I’m hearing oras music (it was the title screen)
God damn it Alpharad you made me cry of how freaking genuenly nice and generous you are towards your friends
Am still waiting for teal mask episode
5:59  Luba and Léo! hahahahaha (they're brazilian digital creators)
That’s so amazing! I love that you did that for your friends!! I’m glad you’re happy and had a good trip!
gear 5
dude when you started i was one years old just to make you feel old......don't count my age
Coming from someone who was in residential treatment under a year ago, I’m proud of you. Learning how to just be happy is insanely difficult, and really does take years of work Thank you for making me smile with your goofy little videos on the hard days, and PLEASE TAKE MORE VACATIONS MY GOD!?!?!  I truly hope that you continue to be as happy as you are now :)
happy holidays Mr.Rad, what a beautiful thing giving is.
I think it’s the fact you know your friends so well to know each of their favorite things and interest ✨your a great friend✨
They knew Worlds was chump change compared to the Warehouse level merch they could sell for it
How pokemon makes their money: 1. games 2. DLCs 3. making Alpharad go to their stores
Man I wish Japan was real
Alpharad kissed someone
7:59
Omg that was such a great video! Very happy for u m8! It was very fun,  emotional and inspiring at the same time.     Though im abit disappointed that u stayed in yokohama for a week and didnt visit the life sized gundam 😝
I'm saving now to go to Japan and spend money on pokemon and one piece stuff (I'm under 20 years old) ( also proud about you like macdonalds mexican version over canada XD , also do you try the tacos de lengua ? )
I'm saving now to go to Japan and spend money on pokemon and one piece stuff (I'm under 20 years old)
if i was rich
I do the same thing with American chains in different countries.   However, try McDonald’s from Hawaii and Guam also. They are good.
the miku girl is absolutely sending me this is such a wholesome video amazing work
Aussie McDonald's is the best
Sanji-san has me dying
this video was really good.
W friend
Thank you Pokémon Company for using your momey for a wonderful reason to
And you said you couldn't write endings
Did you know that 711 Japan is apparently buying 711 Australia
The “I was the first blonde person he ever saw” really screams ignorance…you know there are lots of blonde haired people specifically in Tokyo haha. You just legit look like Sanji
wooo
Ok at the end I just wonder if it’s what you bought in Japan or just some other stuff
11:14 he kiss someone just slow it down  on 0.25x and stop
The bit at the end is amazing
Hmm..... can you now write all those things you baught of as a company expense? XD
Okay, I went to Japan in November, and I also splurged on stuff for myself in Akihabara, getting mostly Fate merch and Yugioh Rush Duel cards
I'm going to be honest with you: the message at the end was very much lame and almost insulting.  You talk about how you've never had a vacation and how overworked you are, while making a video about you being flown to Japan by the Pokemon Company, and then proceeded to spend more money in a week than I make in a year, by more than triple.  You're an internet funny man whose job is to play video games. Quite frankly, your life is a vacation. And your feel good message at the end is to give the shit you bought away to other people who play video games for a living.  Yeah, you're very much disconnected with your audience. This is the modern day version of "let them eat cake".
SPEAKING OF MAGICAL MIRAI I GOT AN A GRADE CAPSULE ON ONE OF THE GACHA MACHINES AHAHAHAHAHH I GOT A MINI FIGURINE
Goes on trip and spends close to $20k *without going broke*, then proceeds to give most (if not all of it) to his friends... damn. I'm a grown man crying, and that's OK 🥹  also definitely a pointcrow moment when the first thing he pulls out, he can't show XD
Ey
Wait... Have you tried max? Bc you might have mixed up McDonalds with Max😭
What were the bags in 9:06 with the Mario game case???
11:14 !!!!
Stooop the little mermaid one I wanted so bad but already spent so much money 😭
sprigatito is the hero of heros
Dude I would do the same thing..currently learning the tcg to one day be able to maybe try at going into competitions. plus I just so badly want to go to the next world's.
It's ok man, you can do like Rubius, who start to do less videos and live his life (he is de only YouTuber I know that still do videos but don't force his mind to make the videos if he don't want ) or like MissaSinphonia who just make videos when he have time and feel that he like the result  Yeah, I'm from LATAM Soo I don't have examples from English YouTubers, hi from Dominican republic by the way
Pokemon company Next time they will have to pay you for a flight and 5 seats for your suitcases XD
After visiting Japan last year on a miniscule budjet its so cathartic seeing Jacon running around China Town and Yokohoma buying all the things wanted to lol. If tou go back definitely visit Chilulu in China Town. The Hostel on the second floor is run by the nicest guy and the cafe on the first is amazing
Tempted to buy nintendo merch, I never realized how good it was
alright who has been keeping track of the total costs  lol
:)
You should’ve brought Japan Braden as a translator ;)
I think every time the camera went to izzy she was screaming, and honestly I can't blame her.
Still cany get over the fact that they sell porn in 7-11
Alpha, you’ll always be one of my favorite youtubers if not my favorite. I been watching you since 2014-15, when you started making those How To Play 101 Smash 4 montages. I was only like 14 ish but now I’m a grown man & I always watch your videos when you upload. Watching your videos is nostalgic to me & seeing you grow / become more popular makes me happy, keep up the good work alpha!
I came here for the ride of financial ruin because I’m planning my Japan trip for March and just love how this video ended. Beautiful storytelling and thank you for sharing this 😊
This dude gives off major incel vibes
After hearing Alpharad talking about one piece in a pokemon video *Me: hol up, Let em cook*
皆幸せそうで嬉しい😂
that amazing im so glad you had a great experience and i loved seeing everyone so happy at the end too
17:09 is this a gamer getting deep oh no..
also too real, sweden has the most amazing mcdonalds ever. id know, im a swede.
0:08 yokohama is the city where the anime bungo stray dogs took place. the character kunikida doppo is a citizen in yokohama. therefore this entire video is a kunikida reference (i really like kunikida guys)
日本でポケモンとかミクとか、食べ物とか、色んな物を楽しんでくれてよかったー！ ただこの人が海外旅行を楽しむ映像かと思って再生したから、彼が周りの人たちのおかげで今の人生がすごく楽しいって話すシーンとか、最後に彼の友達が彼からの贈り物を楽しそうに開封している様子を見て、今まで全く知らなかった人達なのに、すごく感動したし、幸せな気持ちになった。  こんなんいきなり来ると思ってなかったから😂
Honestly I don’t blame you I would have blown a hole in my pocket as well…
the plushies are nice and look good, but why would you need to have them.... like.. all of themm?
Actually, the people who you are in debt to and who you owe are your subscribers... but thats okay... i dont need anything... rip
when my brother went to japan this past summer he got me that same magnetic kuromi !! i love it sm
I want some pikmin merch plz
英語全く分からなかったけど日本を楽しんでくれたこととこいつが最高なやつなことは分かった
Its crazy because Toast stayed in japan longer as planed too. Japan is just the best place out there I guess
Jaiden!!!
I HAVE TO LIKE THIS VIDEOO!!!! I HAVE TOOOOOOO ❤❤❤
OMG YOU SHOULD GO TO DONKI THEY HAVE ANYTHING
Honestly the end of this video speaks to my heart this this is the joy I want to give my friends.
また来いよ
I don't give comments. Allot tbf on YouTube but ..  I've been watching your vids for a while now tried joining streams ( no succes yet haha) I think you are super entertaining , thanks for filling my free hours with amazing fun content  , this video for some reason actually made me tear up hard at the end.  I hope to keep seeing your amazing content and I hope you will always take care of yourself .   Love from some guy in Belgium :D 💖
711 in Japan is great I want to Japan for my school holidays and my God have you had coffee Jelly cause it's just perfect
日本の様々な場所、文化を楽しんでくれて良かった🇯🇵😊また遊びに来てください✈️ありがとう🤝
11:14 is cool
OMG😊
1:22 A Hat in Time music detected, time to parade
Bruv spend 3 million on merch 💀💀💀
At first I loved it but now it makes me dipresed because I will never afford any of tjis
He is flexing his wallet
i started sobbing when you added all your friends reacting to their gifts omggg ;;;;;
5:25 WHAT?! POPPY PLAYTIME IN JAPAN?!
Oh man, I just discovered your channel with this video and ended up crying. You didn’t just give them souvenirs, you genuinely know them and gave them stuff that they would like, and that says a lot about you ❤
It's nice to hear you be proud of yourself and to see you're doing good! It is really really great that you were able to get better mental health wise. I will say that to me it also felt almost, like, out of touch to me. Like you compared to most of your fanbase really are in completely different worlds. It's hard to see others do the things you want to do. But the fact you're able to is great!
I'm not surprised a 7/11 in japan sells porn
Hell yeah alpharad. We're happy that You're happy! :D
The message about what YouTube feels like is spot on. I mean I'm not saying it's the only job/occupation that feels like that, but especially the constant confrontation with how things are going can easily get to someone's mind, at least for me that's the case ^^ and you can use tools to hide certain performance stats, but it's still what you earn monthly, so you will know regardless. But what you can be really proud of is that you have been doing YouTube for so long and are still growing, while having major success. Most people don't even exist for half that period or are forgotten, so that's a ginormous achievement. And I'm glad to hear all turned out well in the end and you were able to change your mindset/how you feel about things, keep going strong :)
How does Japan make plastic look edible
Such a great testimony and video 🥹
Pokemon bought the flight for Jacob to buy it over 😂
WAS THAT CDAWGVA??? OR EVEN KNOWN AS CONNORDAWG? OR EVEN KNOWN AS MONKE????????????????? also i love you to alpha
18:59 don’t ask me how I know this but you are flying on a United airlines Boeing 787 seated in Polaris First class
2014 was almost 10 years ago. Wow, i'm old.
it's so precious to hear that you are genuinely happy. You are an awesome guy and I'm so happy that you can say that about yourself. Keep up your lifestyle, we love you 😁 ps: the ending made me cry :(
what the FRICK happened at karaoke
21:02 Who is she?
12:00 I'm sorry but those eevee bags are so cool
15:48 that neon sign says uisce in japan, that's irish? is that a weird coincidence, orrrrrr.
I hope to have that much money one day. And the room for it.
❤
this video s first half is basically why and how japan focus so much its market in things for tourism shops   and i love it
man the kiss of the century
Sanji-san really grew out his rat beard
awesome vid..damn you are sooo lucky!! I cant even afford Japan this year..
What in the Fuckshit did he get pointcrow?
What a trip man i love how u spent the money and give it all to your friend i love this friendship of guys , u are truly kind dude
can someone tell me the name of the song that starts to play at 20:55?
I can't unsee the Sanji comparison
great video
have the same hobby as your friend is so amazing
I had resubbed to this channel before watching this, but this video has locked me into this subscription. I'm weirdly incapable of crying, but this nearly got me. Godspeed, Jacob, you're an awesome guy.
7-11 is actually goated. Good man!
15:29 ohara??
This video just felt satisfying to watch, and not in the normal way but instead in the sort of "things feel accomplished, you did it"   You have done Amazingly so far Jacob "Alpharad" and I look forward to the future with a smile.
6:46 Anyone knows this banger playing in the background?
As a fan of Pokemon, One Piece, and Hatsune Miku, this made me really happy
8:30 is the new shibuya incident
I heard the word shibuya and promptly had a panic attack (tw next time please 😭)
Alpharad: $1,000? I'll take it, sure. I got WAY more money to spend.  Me in my dreams the other night: damn, this bottle of whisky is $45.00, thats too expensive I cant afford that rn.🥲
awesome :)
This was really unsatisfying and very boring I didn't want a personal story that went on and on! Thumbnail suggested I'd get to see cool merch and well...i didn't😪 Second video in a row of this channel's i've watched and regretted wasting my time.. Won't bother next time
Wtf is this image 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 11:15
The irony of branding xylitol with a canine pokemon 😐 you know, xylitol, that artificial sweetener that they put in peanut butter sometimes that gives your dogs kidney failure.
11:14
Jaiden looks bad ass with those tattoos
I went for a trip in Japan 4 weeks ago as well 😂
Hey Alpha, just caught up on this vid. Not sure if you keep up with comments on vids from a month ago, but I’ve been following you for a while (prior to 1M I think) and always thought that “Mario’s Ultimate Forward Aerial” was my number 1 favorite video of all time coming from you (one of your classic videos, which is a major contrast from this video), but after seeing this video, it was beautifully edited and amazing, I’m glad you’re confidently saying you’re happy and are successful in doing what you love. You are an inspiration. Cheers my mans!
1:32 As a certified Dutchman, I can, with 100% certainty, say that our McDonalds is absolute dogshit.
i didn't even know you could check that many bags! that might almost double the cost of the actual stuff lol.  this was an awesome video, so proud of your channel's growth and your personal growth as a human <# (waffle heart)
The fact Jacob said this could have been his last YouTube video is terrifying. I don’t expect him to be q YouTuber forever but the fact that one day we might never get another video makes me sad. I’ve been watching him since 5th grade and I will soon be graduating high school. I love these videos and I loved growing up with channel and I’m excited for the future
Gay Alpharad kiss jumpscare
8:35 hey look it’s all about me
Omg my heart was bleeding with so much love pressure at the end so sweet to think about the friends who helped you along the way 🥹
Omg my heart was bleeding with so much love pressure at the end so sweet to think about the friends who helped you along the way 🥹
Let’s go big head
okay Alpharad the ending was so wholesome you get a pass for your financial irresponsibility. Crying. Also loved the Jaiden Cucurucho feature. You said it without saying it.
Never thought it would be an Alpharad video that would make me tear up. Good job Jacob! You deserved every bit of that trip! What an amazing friend! ❤
a very wholesome end to this video very wholesome
This overspending of money by foreign tourists in Japan is why the Japanese government loves them and is trying to bring in more each year. With an aging population foreigners are the ones who are helping out the Japanese economy vastly.
11:14 Good for you bro 👍
idk why but i legit started crying because of this video, just felt so...real to me.
Why do you do a voice over when you recorded your face it’s super off putting
Hey, Alpha, I know you’ll probably never see this, but I want you to know,  I love you, we all love you. I don’t think there’s anything else to say.
When you said “season of Pikmin 4” I almost shit myself because I thought that Altrive somehow got sponsored by Nintendo or something lol.
I plan on going to Japan this summer 😩😩😩❤️
yeah, this made subscribe for sure!
10/10 friend there
Jacob why did you kiss that dude
first video i watched of you and i almost teared up how excited your friends got. This vídeo reminded me how wonderful it is you to gift the people you love the most.
First off you kept any rare items. Except the Pokémon jacket but that most be a friend who’s made you bucnh of money & gave him a $200 “thank you box” & all the others, who’ve helped you make hundreds of thousands of dollars, you gave them a 50-$100 “gift box” of just small random shit.   You really tried to make a vid trying to make people feel bad for you. Have zero sympathy for you & must forgot how most People last “10 years of working” your age have worked their asses off not sitting playing video games & will have to keep working their asses off. Amazing how naive/narcissistic you YouTubers get.
Okay but how many plushies did Jaiden buy 😂
Great video
I was not expecting the second half of this vid to turn out the way it did but wow was this truly beautiful to watch! This was so heartwarming Jacob! You and your friends deserve the best and I'm glad you're happy!
Bro kissed a dude💀💀💀💀💀 11:15
So cool to see happy friends. I wish to do the same for mine one day.
I WANT EVERYTHINH HAIKYUU!! FROM THAT SHOPP!!
Of all the things that I thought would make me cry today, I wasn't expecting a YouTuber giving a sincere happy speech and being a great friend to be one of them. Good for you, Alpha, you deserve it.
Why take a plane to Osaka, cringe
You're going to commit a crime in my country anyway, right?
Pokemon got the infinite money glitch
11:14 I have no words   Yes, i did cheer
You look so good next to jayden. Hope some love happen
Excellent music choice for the video.
10:20 that’s kind a wholesome in a weird way
Found this guy at my peek depression, my friends and family helped me out of it this is inspiring big time!!! beautiful thank you!!!!
Australia on top of the McDonalds tier list, huh? That's actually kinda neat. 😊 And then this turned into the most wholesome and tear-jerking video ever, I was not expecting that Jacob, but this was magnificent.
Bro doesn’t even buy the good stuff
yep this confirms it. If ever in my life i get the Chance to Visit Japan, im never going to financially recover from it
Ohara!!!!
Imagine being sponsored by pokemon itself, man that's a huge W
noted save at least 20k if i am going to go to japan
That was a lovely video
ポケモンゲットだぜ！
you need to take more time off for yourself man
I just went back and watches some of his older videos, and it honestly brought tears to see how he's come in so many aspects, he truly is a one of a kind YouTuber, and i speak for all of his fans when i say this  Thank you Jacob are internet funny man.❤
That kiss hah
Awesome stuff!!
Alpharad being mean on camera But getting all his friends gifts on his trip You don't fool me. You're a loving guy.  Keep being you. We love you.
Love you Alpharad
Give a Pokémon stuffed animal because yes
Love the persona music
That ending had me tearing up
Nah, i would go crazy
This is the first video I’ve seen of yours and is it so good! Just everything flows so smoothly
Alternative title - My Biggest Tax write off
POV your rich
Consumer:😡 Consumer for friends:❤
Grand envy. Huge envy. Did you find any shiny plushies tho?? Asking for myself.
how did he not gamble his life away
I really want to visit Japan badly so I can buy a lot of Pokemon merchandise
6:10 wow, he wears うんこ t-shirt means poop haha
thanks for visiting to Japan!! lovely!
Pokemon got their money back and free content LOL pokemon should sponsor you again
OMG i love miku's look for the magical mirai show!!!!
helllllpp not sanji-san...😭💀
The video was so cool, wish we saw more of the trip but it was such a good vibe overall. Glad you’re doing more stuff that makes you happy nowadays. ^-^
bruh where’s the link 😭😭
This was definitely my favorite Alpharad video. It was funny, and real, and so wholesome. You're an incredible creator and I'm glad you're happy.
11:15  your welcome
I knew alpharad was really sanji one piece. Maybe major was onto something
Japan is really changing the whole world by letting us people understand the importance of hobbies. I don't really know to how put in words how happy I am to see alpharad shift and the smiles it produced. It made my day
Him not knowing what sanji-San meant is killing me rn bc he looks so much like him. That kid just met the ultimate gaijin
Soy face meme
I'm 100% sure that If I visit Japan someday,  I'll fall into a financial recession like dead ass once I come back
I had such a huge smile on my face at the end of this video. Congrats on a very deserved vacation and spreading so much joy to your crew!
Alpharad being confused for Sanji from One Piece is priceless.
WHY IS DOULINGO(?) SUKUNA
Why is Dutch Mcdonalds at the C tier??
11:14 Ayo 😳
HES FRIENDS WITH OHARA
6:26 WHAT DA HELL??!!
Dude, This is the first video I’ve watched of yours and i must say, I’m a fan now. As an old man, me not you lol, with kids who watch your channel, i have to say THANK YOU! Thank you for taking the time in your vid to share what is really important, to share your story and let others know that its normal and ok to feel lost, to keep going and to seek help if you need it! Thank you for being real, genuine, funny, and for saying fuck and spending money lol……life should be fun and I’m proud of you for showing that! Well done dude and again, THNAK YOU!
This was a ride  And i am glad it paid off
11:14~ 🎉
25:20 ok that was too funny
11:14 Good for you Jacob
The persona music is sooooo on point
It's kind of ironic that Jacob has social anxiety, since I use an Alpharad-type persona to beat any social anxiety i ever get
11:14?!?!?
Yea I’m living there now and it is amazing
Dang it. I keep repeating this vid for inspiration.
Im not crying, you are
explain 11:14
Transport  spent money  in japan.  Train transportation isn't cheap
11:13 👀oh my
idk why but i got so emotional watching all of Alpharad’s friends react to their gifts 😭
Sanji-san ☠️ 10:21
Bro what they do to Kobe.
I’m happy that you’re happy dude!
11:14 You're welcome.
I want to see your haul
I never thought it was possible to be borderline suicidally jealous, but this video proved it to me. Thanks mr. Rad
“Not seven eleven 🥱”, “Sebben erevenu 😈”
I wish I had that kind of money
1:31 mc donalds french fries aren't that good in France i guess
Jacob, thank you for being you; it's just the best watching you be genuinely happy and yourself.
11:14 no questions asked
White boy goes to japan season 3838372 episode 28475729, wonder which one it is, this time
This was so wholesome that I got diabetes of the eyes. Amazing work 🎉🎉🎉
SANJI-SAN

15:31 omg Cdawggg 😆😆
Hey umm there is uhh double big mac in indonesia…. (Im jealous asf i wanna go japan so badly 😭😭😭)
1:04 bro didn’t even use ichi
What the music at 18:21
What the music at 14:05
Jacob, You are Peak Homie, You dropped, SOOOO MUCH Money on Merch, and half of it wasn’t even for you, most went to your friends who you very clearly cherish, Love Your Content, Love Your friend group, Love Pokemon, and Love you dude, You’re a Badass man, stay happy with the Badass Friends you have that make you want to be an awesome person
guys, you should really try Hungarian McDonald’s best stuff I’ve ever had👍👍
L for your wallet
I love the freaking one piece reference in the thumbnail
09:55 i was there 2 weeks ago, that shit floored me when i saw it
did I just see a split frame of jacob alpharad making out
Is he dating jaiden?  They always together
its so nice to see a youtuber ive been subbed to since 2017-18 actually grow to be a genuinely good person and not fall for greed and money, kudos Jacob
Thank you soooo much for this video, I will stop myself from ever going and spending money I don’t have to buy all the things 😪😅 ommgggggg I would buy everythinggggg
👑 🤲 You dropped this...
I really love that he remembers his friends and the people who got him to where he is, I applaud you for that.🎉❤❤
I’ve seen this in Jaiden’s stories
cdawgva !!
Honestly, I love this video of course but I straight up just had an entire freak out that they use tobacco in Japan and I makes me so happy 18:36 I'm so giddy
I came for a Pokémon video but I liked for the friendships that alpha made along the way😂
If this was Jacob’s reaction to Japanese 7-11, I’d love for him to experience a Don Quijote the next time he visits. “Supermarket on psychedelics” doesn’t even *begin* to describe that place 😂
The ending's gonna make me cry
OMG your friends With fail boat!
I love pokemon so much I have a lot of pokemon merge
711 sells WHATTTT
That was actually a good life lesson near the end there Alpha, and especially with the heartwarming gifts to friends, here's to that coming 10 year anniversary with being one of the funnest creators throughout, cheers
Honestly, being mistaken for Sanji should be a career highlight.
14:12 crunchyroll worst nightmare (free anime to watch)
i love the end where he gave so much stuff away
Holy crap this video was so real the second half was the true jacob, not alpharad. And god damn was it eye opening.
Food 🍔 Food in Japan🍔(ya but in Japan)
do we wanna explain the last frame at 11:13 ???
That legitimately made me cry, must be nice having friends
This is the kind of shit that makes you the kind of person I strive to be Jacob. You're a great friend and a cool guy and genuinely kind of my personal hero.
So, as a full time creator myself, I know it’s unlikely you’ll see this but I wanna say it anyways. YT pushed me this vid cuase Ig was about Pokémon worlds. I’ve never heard of you before, but decided to watch. I loved the video, and the latter part was especially touching. I’ve been full time for 3 years, and while we aren’t rolling in cash, it keeps the paid. I can definitely relate to a lot of the mental and emotional challenges you talked about. It was amazing to see all the smiles of all the people you are friends with and send those packages too. Reminds me to continue to connect with people and make friends and trust, no matter how many times other creators are shady, there’s always good ones out there. Thanks for this video man. I hope you see this and know that this video made a difference. 😊
I got the same dragonair and I went to Uji too
im happy.... right now *proceed to cut to jaiden* brother man i am so happy for you too 😭😭😭
This is one of the most wholesome videos I've seen in a while🙏❤️godbless your soul alpha
Can someone tell me what the song is at the end?
Deezus sighted
I'm literally crying, how dare you? 🥺
Kid in a candy store < Weeb in Japan
Hey Internetfunnyman. i appreciate you being so open with your feelings and history with your channel. there will always be a piece of me that loves your channel like i’m the same kid that watched falconXfalcon. you’re my internet inspiration
11:14
Not me almost sobbing over the end of the video omg
Mcdondals in norway is goated dude
11:14 gay alert activated
11:14  😂
Buying all the items for your friends was an incredible twist.
As a huge anime and Pokémon fan I have been wanting to go to Japan for years now, this video has made me realise that financially it would be a terrible idea as I would do the exact same as Alpha
MAIN CHANNEL ALPHARAD!?!??!
I wish just getting there wasn't so expensive. This would be a dream to me
WHERE! CAN! I! GET! THAT! JOLTIK! PLUSH!  AND IS THERE A GALVANTULA ONE?
Wait your gay?
im not crying you are
did you buy me something?
are yoi mr best
11:15
HEY ALPHARAD I PAID 8K SO YOU CAN GET SOME HELP😢
youre an inspiration alphard this video was amazing. such a touching thing you did for your friends :')
I watched this right after the alpharad friend awards video and man. I’m just so happy :D
I really REALLY want the shirt narrator alpha is wearing.
8:45 I had a charger like that at one point, saw the weapon and thought “oh that’s neat, didn’t know they were still sol- WAIT IS THAT A TRISTRINGER”
This is so sweet omg
😭😍
Holy crap my respect for this man just went 📈
Ok I think that is adorable that Alpharad Got mistaken for a literal anime character from one piece by a kid. I would feel honored if I got mistaken for an anime character.
We’re so proud of you alpharad for coming this far, hearing you explain how you feel happy really touched me, thank you for giving me hope
Bullying is a natural part of the internet, it’s one of the few things that’s actually funny on this site let the people have their fun
NO WAY OHARA WAS THERE TOO?!?!?!?!?!
God, i wish I had that financials like you … is this all from streaming and video recording?? If so, can you help me improve please??
“And we went to Shibuya,you know the place where u spend money?” Me as a jjk fan:and then?
moral of the story- Jacob looks like Sanji if u really squint ur eyes
2:09 You should’ve learned Katakana 🥲  Katakana is the alphabet for loanwords, which means words originally from other languages (mostly english) so you could understand majority of the words written in katakana!  Example: チケット= chiketto = ticket   スーツケース= su-tsuke-su = suitcase  プール = pu-ru = pool
Bro the emotions and tears are real with the fact you did that for your friends
This is so wholesome. I love it. You seem like a great person, and youre lucky to be surrounded by friends you love. You deserve the best ^-^
DO A HAUL GORL
I wanna see Jan top Alpharad
I’ve only recently subscribed, but the ending made me tear up and just overall restored some strength back in me with my own mental health journey. Thank you 💙😭
This video was so wholesome towards the end  Also 11:14 👀👀👀 from enemies to lovers
Was this also the japan trip where Jacob and Jaiden met up with connor and on a dinner they had, they saw the creator of Pokemon?
OH MAAAAAAHHHH GAAAAWWWWDDDDDDDDD ALPHARAD KISSED SOMEBODYYYY
Make a tier list of everything you got!
A whole new video at 15:43... You deserve all the happiness, king! Thanks as always for these years of great content and creativity!
I can always find Jaiden in these videos.  She literally glows.
I’m so happy to hear Jacob is finally happy with where he is in life. He’s honestly just an amazing guy, glad you had fun in Japan!
just came back from japan myself, and now i feel like i did it wrong :D
alright guys, whos taking me to Japan?
When I went to Japan I spent more than 600 dollars and I only had 600 dollars
Jacob knowing all of his friends incredibly well is really a unappreciated talent for someone with such a big friend group
Lol i love the the most replayed moment is the drunk kiss. Thanks youtube, very cool
Ok but I need to know where I can get that Shanks jacket
I NEVER COMMENT ON YOUTUBE VIDEOS BUT ARE WE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT JACOB IS MAKING OUT WITH SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE JAN AT 11:14
11:14
11:14 finally!
19:07 I’m so glad for you! I hope to one day find happiness as well. Currently I’m in my 3rd year & hating university. With everything being unsure in life, only time will tell if I end up by the wayside or successful like yourself. Thanks for a nice video :)
I'm a pretty casual pokemon fan. Loved it as a kid, but I don't buy every game that comes out anymore. But after watching this, I'm so hyped for next year's one cuz I live in Honolulu! Yah the announcement was ill-timed, but a decision like this is definitely made at least a year ahead of time, so they couldn't change it or anything. Maybe they could've delayed the location announcement, but not like it would've really done anything.
pokemon going all out with the marketing
8:48 Did Zelda dirtY 😂😂😂😂
bro alpha wth is this 11:14🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
What did pointcrow get that was so bad that he couldn't show?
HELL YEAH HE WENT TO MAGICAL MIRAI
I've been watching alpharad since the smash 4 days and plus/deluxe/gold/whatever it will be next year since it's inseption and the entire second half of this video was way more emotional that it really should be for a parasocial funny man talking about his mental health and giving gifts to his friends. Seeing his reference all the stages of his channel and show how far he's come just put the biggest smile on my face. Thank you Alpharad for the years of amazing content that lives rent free in my head and thank you Jacob for putting yourself out that. I think all 3.3 million subscribers are happy to see you're doing ok and feel like you can be yourself while still being our favorite internet funny man.
Does anyone know the song around the 13 minute mark please
THE END WAS SO WHOLESOME ❤
i'm only like 3 minutes in and already loving this video! i went to japan both last year and this year and this year i was actually around during the same time alpha was (i saw those same stairs in the airport at the beginning, that weird kobe bryant etc) a lot of this really echoes my first time there in 2022, especially the "knowing how to read japanese via duolingo but not understanding anything" thing. it's just funny and interesting to see some of my exact opinions echoed
this video is just adding to my hyperfixations
Was not expecting to get this emotional over an alpharad video🥹
Hats off to you for spending 3,705 dollars (if I did the math correctly) on stuff for all your friends. Keep up the good work👍
Ik I’m late to comment, but Jacob has been my favorite youtuber for years now, and it hurts knowing that someone is most likely silently hurting and not being able to do anything about it. Knowing that he is now after 10 long years of content creation, is finally happy, might be some of the best news I’ve heard in a long time. Good job man. I’m so glad you had a good time in Japan. We’ll all be waiting here patiently for your next post.
💙💙💙
11:14 and this is the moment I realised I'm not your fan long enough to know you that much.  Anyway I have to see Japan at least one time in my life.
Mf really went and ordered a life sized Ace figure, huh.
So, did you make out with Jan?
Thank you so much alpha for the amazing video to watch, really put some happiness in my afternoon so thank you :D
This video actually made me think a lot, about what I'm doign with my time, if I'm spending it wisely, and if I'm happy with what I'm doing and where I'm going in life, and changed my perspective a bit, I have many dreams but I haven't even attempted to start chasing any of them yet, and I'm not sure what about this video sparked something in me, but I want to change for the better and be able to make myself happy, I went into this video thinking it would be about a silly little trip to Japan, not expectign a monologue about mental health. But after watching you for years I'm glad you can be happy with yourself and your life and still continue entertaining us fans. All together this was a great video and I enjoyed it a lot. Maybe I could come back to it someday with a better understanding of myself and a more happy healthy mindset.
I genuinely cried. Jacob, I hope you truly understand just how much this community loves you. I've personally looked up to you for a long time now and for many different reasons at that. You are an incredibly charismatic and talented content creator, with the BEST comedic timing on YouTube. You've been an role model for kids everywhere showing that it's okay to love and feel passionate about your childhood interests, and that growing up doesn't mean you have to give them up. And now, you've set an incredible example by being honest and vulnerable not only with us, but with yourself! That's hard! Obviously I can only truly speak for myself, but I think it's safe to say that many people will continue to get excited whenever they get that notification that you're live or uploaded a video until the day you retire. Much love, I can't wait to continue to see you grow! ❤
Jacob: Listen, creating content for 9 years is taxing. But you know what makes it worth it? Jacob: *montage of all of his friends getting all of the gifts he bought for them* Me: *MELTS* THIS IS SO WHOLESOME
Ah man I'm crying. This made me so happy, now I'm making a list of gifts I wanna give to my friends ❤‍🩹 thank u
Incredibly wholesome surprise ending!
If that kid had said something translated along the lines of "Mr. Blond," you could have been even more taken aback and made a Reservoir Dogs joke.
I didn't expect this video to be so heartwarming. On the verge of sobbing, brb.
literally gonna be me in japan tho- zero self control, consumerism has my wallet in a choke hold and japan knows how to exploit it. also 50 shades of fuuuucked up in Karaoke.
I know you received some hate for this video. But I appreciate you posting it and enjoyed watching it
did you see alpharad  kiss a man for a split secont man gay
I GOT THAT ONE PIECE ULTIMATE DECK TOO WHEN I WENT TO JAPAN A FEW WEEKS AGO! BASED
Appreciate the love you have for ur friends first time on ur channel subing right now much love bro… ps im glad u found your happiness again man blessing 🙏🏾
I just love how 7-11 is a basic run of the mill convince store in the states, always found in a washed up dirty corner of the crappiest spot you can find and only good for slurpees, but in Japan it’s like untouchable holy land where they warship it like their god, so it gives them Gundams, Mangas, toys, food, etc…glad they found their market
11:14 is an interesting moment
Your living every Pokémon fans dream
I have one question  do yall know the various music/osts that alpharad used in the video?
I think you have a problem with pokemon Alpharetta.
Bro knew that Hatsune Miku was gonna be everywheree
Bruh I saw that
7:57 purplcliffes was the best especially the eye
This might sound corny, but this is my favorite video from Jacob. The man went to Japan and bought a mountain of merchandise, but he didn't get it all for himself. He cares about his friends, and he wanted to thank them in the best way possible. Sure it absolutely murdered his bank accounts, but that doesn't really matter when you use the money he earned on his friends. Absolutely fantastic video Jacob, and I hope that you continue doing what makes you happy.
I just soyed all over myself fuck I love Pokémon
3:06 didn’t know Jacob had social anxiety. He always struck me as a very confident person.
Can we get a video of Alpharad going through all the stuff he bought in Japan???
Finally, a video about my experience in Japan too
ITS IN HAWAII NEXT YEAR???????? LETS GOOO
Jesuschrist that's almost 10k on merchandise. I hope to do that one day. But i wll include Gundam plastic model kits too..😊
I think that people really make the assumption that people over react about japan but i think if i were to go id do the same thing because its a new experience. Who wouldnt want a new experience sometimes.
so um Alpharad wtf is at 11:14 that you don't want to explain
Damn you really look like sanji 😂
Its hard seeing others live your dreams.  Lol!
SATOSUGU IN THE THUMBNAIL!!!
Boo hoo I'm rich.  That's how you sound. Which means that's important to me. Glad you're happy.
actually nutty that u got sponsered by pokemon, like the pokemon
my guy SPENT A CAR PRICE on merch and figurines and stuff.  A GOOD AMERICAN USED CAR  holy cow.
I just love how he got such wholesome gifts for everyone and then for pointcrow just stuff he can’t show on stream
RIP Alpharad's bank account
There’s no shot this will ever get read but not knowing much about this incredible dude and amazing friend I decided to watch this clip and found myself moved to tears listening to Jacob tell himself he doesn’t have to justify being happy. I saw so much of my own lifelong endeavors I’ve fought and fortunately overcame to finally achieve happiness myself in him I kinda went away for awhile and totally found myself enthralled. Then the friends opening the gifts from him came and I lost it, what an absolutely loving and kind dude, for real. I can establish you are straight up genuine and deserve all the good that’s come and coming your way and I’m pretty stoked you’re starting to live that truth man, one love brother!
is nobody gonna point out 11:14 where alpha is making out with somebody
did you meet purplecliff?
ALPHARAD NEXT TIME YOUR IN JAPAN VISIT THE STRAWHAT CREW STATUES OR IF YOU HAVENT GO TO SOME OF THEM
More than just a trip.
Im going to cope and believe we'll see a Trash Taste episode with either Jaiden or Jacob as a guest. 🙏
20:56 this is so wholesome I'm gonna sob
NGL I was in universal on the day before the one piece event happened and I was so sad that I missed it 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
i cant believe I got this recommended to me never seeing a single video of yours and not only am I gonna subscribe but also I am going to keep going more into my mental health journey this really inspires me to countinue to want to do content and follow my dreams no matter how hard the struggle is...Thank you
7-11 have what ??
Couldn't help but laugh at this paused moment... 11:14   Was there any tongue?
17,000 dollars….. that’s crazy  Edit: I didn’t watch the whole video when I said this but I guess it was well spent
You're not gonna talk about purpleciffs  Magnemite, Edward?
11:17
This took a very wholesome turn. Good job!

Genuinely, I wish I had a friend group as solid as Alpha’s. Filled with streamers or not, they just all care for each other and it’s amazing
11:14 is wild
Dr pepper is fire my favorite soada
He took THAT photo out….
And this is the reason I love Japan too much cool stuff you don't even know what to do and want everything you see.
GUYS 11:14 TRUST ME YOU WANNA PAUSE THAT EXACT TIME
I wanna live in Japan now, I really love Pokémon and Kirby, and Pokémon and Kirby, is amazing in Japan, so I wanna live in Japan, and live out my dreams of having an Ingo and Emmet shrine and a Magolor bedroom
I love you alpharad you are the best YouTuber ever and I'm really glad you got a vacation :) you definitely deserve it and I hope you'll have fun for the future with your friends while exploring the world
Jaiden and alpharad are dating frfr
The realization about wanting to explore the world and enjoy life to the fullest came to a few days ago. Seeing someone else coming to the same realization had me smiling like an idiot haha. Super happy for you Jacob and thank you for the great videos you provide.
motivating
Dude, I'm glad I met you for a second in Japan and even happier to see this video where you found some sort of happiness dude. I'm just happy for you dude
the ending had me in tears;-;
FINALLY THE ENDING TO THE JACOB/JAN ROMANCE WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR
my Dad worked in a factory for the better part of 50 years and never got 2 weeks vacation, he retired last year and found out he had stomach cancer and passed away 2 months later.   I'm glad you got to take a well deserved vacation for weeks in a foreign exotic land spending tens of thousands of dollars on toys. I know how taxing editing videos and playing video games can be.
I cried
I'm going to Japan in January and I'm trying to learn some more Japanese before then, but I don't have a crazy budget lol. I'm honestly going mostly to see things, go skiing and maybe buy a few video games. I also just want to learn more about Japan and have the opportunity to talk to people in Japanese.
You need no help. You just need to spend. Feed your addiction!!!  And nice moment of reflection.   As someone who went to Japan, yeah, it really encourages one to just walk the streets. Its safe, if not THE safest streets to walk. Heck, you can fall asleep on a bench or something without worry. Truth.   Cool thing you did for your friends.
eeyyyy its konna
Best Part Start 20:48
HOW DARE YOU PUT COSTA RICA AND AMERICA MC DONALDS IN THE SAME TIER. ITS OBVIOUSLY AT LEAST AN A
EVERYONE, TENNO HEIKA... BANZAAAAAAAI!
You just got cheated by Pokémon
Not seven eleven. Family mart
honestly the first 5 minutes started to feel like damn i wish i was there to damn i don't want to watch anymore so it doesn't spoil it for me when i actually go. Sorry Alpha, i'm not gonna finish the video but i know you had an awesome time!
glad you coudl enjoy your vacation and still find a way to write it off on your taxes.  you deserve it.
idk who is miku but that is wild
Wouldn't it be funny if Alpharad suddenly appears on Trash Taste because of this trip?
11:14, thank me later
5:09 nah its elsa x asahi
Its Sad too see Norway this low on the macdonalds tierlist, althoug i can confirm
Dude Alpha I’m so happy for you!! Japan was definitely the best trip of my life too!
Wow I have never watched your channel and here I am crying 😭
i would make the exact same financial decisions... maybe worse
happyrad (edit) what the fuck im crying
早く日本から出たい
Jacob alpharad you have single-handedly gotten me into Hatsune Miku with that couple seconds of Miku
Alternate title: "rich ass youtuber goes to japan for free because the most profitable media company ever sponsors him and spends 1% of his money (1 trillion dollars)"
bro every time any youtube goes to japan they always start putting Japanese in their videos for the next like month and i always fine that hilarious
did he kiss jan?
11:14  I FOUND THE GAY KISSING SCENE
San ji san 😂
Go to the phillipines 25 dollars is like 1200++ and you can get so much things with it
I'll call you "Elite Trainer Sanji" now
11:14 Aaaand they got drunk
I gotta say this was super cool to see but also Jaiden is dripped out in all of this?? Both of you dressed super well for what is clearly the most important event ever
Jesus loves you!
That's so cute ❤ Love that you're happy
I'm going in 2 weeks. I am scared for my bank account and sanity quite frankly.
Nah I would have spent a ungodly amount of money too bro why lol
Yoooooooioooooo Australia on top with chain in different countries teir list
Cant believe I missed him and Jaiden at USJ, Sunshine City and the Jump store
MIKUUU MY QUEEENNN
Is this a bungo stray dogs reference
Hey alpharad, i don't know if you'll notice this comment, but i've been a fan if yours ever since i was in high school watching the "How to 101" videos with my friends up till now, you've grown a lot as a content creator and person and I'm just happy to see you living your life to the best that you have without forgetting your fans at the end of the day.  Thank you for all the fun years and the grind that it took to keep this channel going. I'm glad to see you enjoyed this well-deserved vacation/trip.
seeing how much Alpharad spent on merch is the very exact reason I could never live in japan, my wallet would never financially recover lmao
11:14 BRO WTF
2:45
Would absolutely buy a giant ace
Holy shit its Sanji OnePiece
The end of this vid made me cry. Seeing someone do something for a long time, and eventually be able to give to others gives me hope for my life and career.
Classic Alpharad W
I wish i could actually afford pokemon merch.
Rich people moment
You poor man LITERALLY
bro wtf was this 11:13
11:14
Such a banger
Alpharad spends 18k on merch, realizes its problem, decides to give its friends ALL the shit instead of keeping it. They get happy as hell, everyone wins.
Hey hey hey, for the McDonalds thing, my dad went to Japan for a few weeks (we're American) and he said the Mcdonalds there was the best thing he ate the whole trip so...
Haul video?
I love the addition of "Peace and Tranquility"
How i made the US goverment pay me to go to japan , got my viewers to give me money to go to japan, and got a tax right off all in one fell swoop.
This video made me smile sm probley a lot more in a while anyway this made me smile a specially with the end thank you!
ALPHA LIKES EVA?!?!?! 10:03
7 eleven is wildin for what they sellin
Relatable, I spent almost all my money on claw machines
I love that u went to norway but that it was a C makes me mad
I hope Jaiden does a video on her side of this trip. This looks hella fun.
We're happy to hear you're genuienly happy! lord knows we all have our struggles, I only recently started being happy and god does it feel freeing.
Lmao I took a picture next to the  miku in the airport when I went to worlds
this is super wholesome! (also going to japan next year after a stressful time, hope it'll be as relaxing as it was for you! thanks for this video, it made me smile and really looking forward to the trip! glad to see you had a great time! also i too will most likely spend way too much omg)
did anyone els see someone kissing just before day 5?
Say gex
This is a really really sweet video!!! Definitely subscribing for more (like everyone else should) :)  The best parts of this video by far are the section about yourself and finally feeling happy with life, and the section showing all the different passionate creators freak out over the gifts. Incredibly positive way to end what was clearly a major passion project for you.   I have a lot of respect for content like this 🫡
Been a fan since 2014 during high school thanks alpha for making amazing content it has been an amazing journey with you
FYI the link to the Pokémon info is missing from the description, lol
The real point of this video was the tax write off, right?
Omg they finally kissed
This whooole video becomes a tax write off, doesn’t it? I’m jealous.
> Blonde hair dark beard  Wait hold on that kid was cookin
So glad to hear Alpha talking ab how his mental health has improved :)
This just randomly pop up on my youtube. And now, im a subscriber.
YOU SAW MIKU AND ANRI LIVE!???
nah i need to know where he got that shanks jacket cuz gah damn does that shit look heat i plan on going to japan next year
Yeah, i would have no self control in japan either. 😂 everything is so awesome there!
What happened here Alpharad?! 11:14
Alpharad self-fulfillment arc
Same
17 grand! Dude how’d you develop such a spending habit
11:13 This is the first video of this creator I've ever seen. Is it normal to see random clips of them making out with someone?
HOW is mcdonalds UK above Canada?????? The UK fries are so disappointing everytime 😭 makes me miss home 🍁 1:31
...
Jaiden is there?
I went to Japan last week with a budget of $2000 for food and shopping😂 Ending up spending $1200 on food & $3800 on shopping😂😂  Theres just so much to buy in Japan its crazyy😂😂😂
I went there too
I think this is end game of being in about  a million fandoms😂😂
I WAS LITERALLY JUST AT JAPAN HOW DID I NOT SEE YOU also keep up the good content  😁
YO! WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU JUST MADE OUT WITH A DUDE 11:14
OH GOD HE *DOES* LOOK LIKE SANJI
This was a really cool video! I mean, yeah, seeing Miku and the PWT and exploring Japan and trying new foods and seeing new places is awesome, but it’s also a really deep video. Since I’m in a bit of a slump in between college years, I really relate to trying to find out what makes you happy and balancing what you want and what you need. And I’m really glad your happy and that you got therapy. And seeing all your friends being happy about all of the gifts you got them. Not just gifts, but personal and heartfelt gifts. It really makes me hope I can find great friends in my life and one day be successful enough to do special things for my family and friends like this. So to sum it up, I’m glad you had a great time in Japan, happy everyone liked their gifts, thanks pokemon for sending him there, and make sure your budgeting the next few weeks maybe (maybe some pb&j’s or ramen). Thanks for the wonderful video, and I wish you happiness and luck on your future endeavors!
Noooooooo, I went to the Hatsune Miku show in Osaka (which was fantastic btw) in the same day Jacob and Jaiden went and I can’t believe I missed them 😭
I love you so much alpha you’ve been one of the realest YouTubers through out the years and i appreciate what you do on this platform
As an Australian I am very happy that you put Australian Mcdonald’s or macca’s in S tier    Edit: do you recommend doing Pokémon youtube full time and if so what age do you recommend to start????
stop the gifts part im cryingg 🥺🥺🥺🥺
I AM BUYING EVERYTHING IN THAT NINTENDO STORE
jan is way taller than I expected, just from a first look.
I never cried so much in my life
You said that the shops in Japan were like fortnite in crossover products, I feel like you giving a ton of YouTubers Japanese merch is more of Crossover than those 711 products, great job for gettin out of your comfort zone
The ending really brought me to tears, you are truly one of a kind.
CONNOR !!???? OMG!!!
We ain’t just gonna skirt by you getting drunk and kissing the homie
What I learned from this video is that this man is incredibly wholesome and amazing, AND that if I went to Japan I would also spend way too much money
:' ) almost 10 y of content u r awesome bro
Spent half my yearly income on fuckin merch 💀
Y’know… About half way through this video the thought hit me that I’ve been watching Mr Alpharad for 5 years consistently, and that and this video was an emotionally rollercoaster I did not expect…
Thanks for all the amazing content. I’m glad you enjoyed your trip.
japanese is very good. i like the language. Nihongo Jouzu
minion?
I really enjoyed watching this amazing video😢😢🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥ur friends made my cry😭😭😭💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Honestly didn’t expect to tear up a little at the end. This is so incredibly sweet.
“I literally cannot show this on screen-“ Jacob did you give him what I think you gave him? Because if you did that’s an absolute banger of a move. But mostly,the worlds glad to have you with us bro.
looking back its kinda amazing how quickly Alpharad started to nail his youtube videos, literally like within 2 years he was nailing his humour and has stuck with it
I HATE L.A.X.!!! I LOVE THIS VIDEO
So an online beggar wasted an unreasonable money on meaningless shit, bragged about it and then gave it to his favourite group of online beggars to brag about it in a much wider circle.  And apparently it's good for his mental health. You're truly just special when it comes to vanity and being delusional.
almost teared up at the end, its inspiring man, wanting to live a life like yours. The hardships and fight to be better too, its all so damn inspiring
11:13 Jacob?
11.14 go
To po*n 😂
Alphadebt
5:33 FUCK YH I HAVE THAT DRAGONAIR HE SITS IN MY BAG FOR COLLEGE AND MY CLASSMATES USE HIM AS A HEADREST! Dragonair is an awesome little guy.
Im glad to hear that you're happy and that this trip was good for you! You really seemed to have enjoyed it to the fullest and you are so amazing for all those generous gifts. After seeing all your friends so happy with what you got for them, I really want to see a haul of what merch you and Jaiden kept and see both of you as hyped as everybody was!
I was playing Pokémon while watching and almost missed 11:14 I was not mentally prepared for such a rushed finally to Jacobs and Pchalls enemies to lovers arc
Did you kiss your nuzlocke rival?
Good video
So Alpharad TOTALLY is lowkey dating Jaiden.... right?
💛💙
danm you just gonna leave lee out of it. must still be salty after losing that 2v1 shame just kidding man you a real one keep up the good videos man love your content!
I put so many faces to voices in this video
I’m happy you’re happy :)
Didn't expect to end an Alpharad video crying but the amount of thought and love for his friends that must've gone into making those boxes for them-
Jacob if you see this comment just please do what you like and what you want to do
Yay! It's good to see Jacob happy and make his friends happy. Also, I cheered at 11:14. I hope Jan and Jacob are happy!
11:14  IM CRYINGF WHAT
Haha fun video, lots of money spent haha, oh wait why am I crying
that ending montage of everyone opening their boxes was genuinely so sweet
Santa alpharad delivered!
Happy for you!
Referencement
Tbf, your hair rn does kinda give you Sanji vibes. As soon as you said "Sanji-san" I thought, _yeah, I can see it._
1:30 so you got Scotland and then you also have the UK? You coward! If you only had fast food in Scotland and not in England, Wales or Northen island then say it! Don't be a coward!
I like how whoever made the thumbnail put luffy, chopper, nami, and sanji *(holding like 10 boxes for nami)* on the left side and zoro on the right side since he has no sense of direction, there are also jjk and spy family characters on the thumbnail too
fun, entertaining, and wholesome. Nice. Everyone loves to watch wholesome personal growth.
Jaden is just off screen ALSO spending a ton of cash I assume. Y'all gotta add to that giant plush collection! What a fun video!  Edit: Very glad to see this guy I've been watching for years is flourishing. :D
ALPHA RAD :)
Alpharad really said Christmas came early
Seeing Jacob enjoy his time just makes me happy😊
11:10 you’re welcome in advance
Bro wants to be a viral wojack meme so bad
Hey! Why did you delete the Nairo tweets. You had seen the 30 page documemt, what changed?
pokemon sponsoring poketuber videos is weird as fuck to me, not the flying you out there, but the ad in the middle... like what non-customers are you trying to scoop up?
What is the reason that there is a frame when you kiss ?
whar happened at 11:14💀
did you forget to add the link in your description
I SWEAR a nuclear physicist will never read your YouTuber name correctly
Makes me happy to hear Jacob is happy
I'm so hyper for you man! 19:00 im so glad you're doing well in life and that you're happy.  Its my birthday tomorrow  and this truly made my heart melt, seeing someone happy in life just gets me kinda emotional!  It's important to talk about these things and I'm so glad you had all these friends to support you. This is my favourite video I've ever watched! Thank you for this coincidentally timed unanimous birthday gift Jacob! ❤
To quote Michael Jordan  Stop it, get some help
this video makes me incredibly violent i have never felt this enraged by a video on this platform more than this one
Ultraman sneaking in at 2:44
the franky at 15:42 is amazing
So happy to hear you feel good about everything, been a fan since early smash ultimate days and I especially love your storytelling! Thank you for the continued entertainment throughout the years
AUSTRALIA  FOREVER!!!!
Alpharad the most wholesome bean : )
this poor man
"ITS LIKE EVERY PRODUCT IN THIS PRODUCT IS COLLABORATING WITH ANOTHER PRODUCT..... basically its like.. Fortnite. It's like Fortnite. I refuse to elaborate further." as someone who plays fortnite religiously, yes, yes it is. I have a love hate relationship with it lol
therapists when they see alpharad:  HERE COMES THE MONEYYYYYYYY
The worst part about coming back to the states won't be the luggage fees, it'll be how underwhelming our 7/11's are.
how the fuck did you get all that merch back home?
The reason Pokémon treated you so well was because they knew they could recoup the cost from all your purchases XD
this video is fucking awesome man. the entire video is entertaining as ever, and the ending was genuinely bloody emotional.
This video was so wholesome and that one kiss in the middle... I love it. I hope I can do the same for my friends one day.
This was hilarious and super awesome! I've been to Japan and hope to go back soon! So glad you had such a good time (and had such an important realization - SO happy you're happy now)! <3
First, nice Lyn figure! 2nd, Fire video, sir! I really like you had a peaceful, "me" time. More power to you!
Literally me when i went to japan in may also you should go to the “slums” of osaka its so different than everywhere else almost like a post apocalyptic tokyo but my mom ended up hanging out with the yakuza under a bridge it just super cool also super cheap
You spent more in Japan then I make in year. I also know if ever went Japan my wallet would be crying
God this is so wholesome ❤
I’m studying in Yokohama right now! It’s great! Hope you enjoyed it here
You needed to do a arcade colab with ConnorDawgVa
Seeing you giving mystery boxes to YouTubers to react will probably be the best content when you reach a specific goal. Keep up the good work and I hope I can follow this when I start my own channel.
2:20 I know it's probably some stock background music, but that tracks really nice what is it?
I can’t believe Sanji from Single Fraction went to Place, Japan.
Bro is literally Sangi-San
It doesn't matter how long you've been an Alpharad fan; this video is a beautiful pay off from years of hard work that brought a genuine smile to my face
You know, alpha does kinda look like Sanji
Anyone gonna talk about that frame?
You JUMPSCARED ME with WolfeyVGC at 15:04, I should have seen it coming but he's just THERE I do hope you're saving up for the next time!
australia mcdonalds on top
Someone who is good at the economy, please help Jacob budget this. His family is dying.
This video is just amazing in so many ways. The way he plays off the absurd spending, the humor of it all, the strange way you feel just as joyous as he did while he was there (Though that might just be me), and of course the fact that Pokémon themselves made this possible.  Alpharad was one of the first YouTubers I ever watched, so the last part of the video actually hit really hard for me. I’m excited to see the videos Alpha’s got for us next now that we’re seemingly entering a new era of Alpharad
8:04 the magnetite was a special lil guy
As someone who recently got the pleasure of visiting Japan, It truly is amazing! Also thank you for making your videos Alpharad!
u the typa dude to say “This is Bussin!” at a theme park
god imagine being a youtuber and being able to live like this, wtf man, what a dream
Jacob, I like to believe you are the answer to, "We Have Sanji from One Piece at home."
my family also brings an extra empty suitcase. i feel seen
that pchal clip got me hard
Well thank for sharing this adventure and your personal experiences too. It is very good to finally say that “ I am happy” and mean too. Good job you deserve the good things that are coming your way.
that was so sweet i’m literally crying wtf
holy shit you do look like sanji
11:14 so proud of alpharad
I went to France and went to Mac Donald’s instantly. It was tasty but u only get NINE NUGGETS
This is so extremely wholesome. I haven’t been here for the full journey but what I have been here for has changed me in such a positive way that I’m overjoyed that you’ve found your happiness that you’ve given to other people. Here’s to nurturing that happiness and enjoying it as we all keep moving forward. ❤
I didn't expect that at the end wow that is truely humbling
This was such a great vid alpha, your frickik inspiring
..One day I'm gonna go on a journey like you did. And be able to answer 'yes' to that question. 'Am I happy."  I know 20 is pretty fashionably late to the party for something like that.  But I'm a paitent guy. I don't mind the wait.   Just gotta hang on for that inciting incident to spur me on. Starting my own channel, moving out, whatever.  Dunno what it'll be, but I'm sure I'll figure out when it happens.   Just a matter of time.
Xd
ONE PIECEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE THE ONE PIECEEEE IS REEEAALLLLLLLLLLLL
Proof of Nintendo caring sbout their fans has joined the chat.
ooh, you actually came in via Haneda?  I always get stuck with Narita, but maybe it's because of the schedules/airlines I pick
11:14 no context
I need splatoon gun
bro i love Ohara thats so cool you were with him
I would like to Thank You Alpharad, I made my first successful series on YouTube for Pikmin 4. All of my time has been spent on how can I make another successful series?  You reminded me that I was doing that same thing and that there is much more to life. God bless you for all the great things you've done!
Sonic Adventure 2 All A rank Lets fucking GOOOO
Hey Jacob, I just wanted to say, I've been watchin for quite a few years now, and haven't exactly had the best mental health. But I've been working on it a lot and these past few weeks, I've been feeling...happy, just happy, so it means so so much to me to see this now. I wish you the best in your channel and life, and I'll keep watching your videos for as long as you make them. Cheers
been following you since your Sm4sh Videos, its been a journey ! you are the best :)
2:40 are we going to skip the fact that he said p0rn
dont think i didnt see 11:14
7:00 that bg music goes hard, what is it?
good luck beating the sanji allegations XD
Hi! I found this on my Al Gore rhythm so this is my first vid of yours to watch. Wanted to say your kernel about your mental health journey was super important, kudos for sharing it. Got yourself a new subscriber. Glad you had a great time!
I hope one day to be able to give such incredible gifts to my friends like this. This is honestly such a goal
I'm so happy for you ❤
Nice video :D
11:14 care to explain?
I'm so happy I became a fan, all those years ago. It's been amazing to see this channel grow, and the joy you can feel throughout videos lately is so palpable. And it all comes to head in this one, truly brings a tear to my eye! Here's to what comes next!!! A fan now and forever
13:12 I am sorry wot
W mans
miku!!
MCDONALDS SWEDEN S TIER LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO
I hate keeping things to myself- to see that Alpharad to do the same thing (just to a bigger scale) makes me feel quite a bit better about myself, and it's not the same as like giving millions of stuff away like Mr Beast does. These people are his friends, and they are what made him today. So I say this, thank you Alpharad for not making me self conscious about my gifts.
This was such a great and wholeseome video to watch! I'm so glad you enjoyed your first vacation in a while and got to treat your amazing friends!!! You all deserve it ✨✨
I want a friend like you, I want to go to this and be spoiled. Just arrrrg I went to japan and I want to go back so badly.
7:00 JAIDEN!!!!!!!!
aaron 'cybertron' zheng shown
the end of the video was so damn wholesome I almost cried <3 thanks for the great entertainment and I wish you all the best and a healthy life Jacob :)
The kid looking at you and thinking you look like Sanji is extremely precious.
ALPHARAD SPONSORED BY POKEMON SCARLET AND VIOLET????
Was pokemon trying to fatten you up for slaughter????
THE ENEMIES TO LOVERS SCENE !!!!
Alpha joins Duval in the illustrious club of "People mistaken for Sanji"
taking the last seven minutes of this video to highlight how much thought and effort you put into bringing all of your friends home items they will truly appreciate forever.....that's how you do it
i hate people being happy. everyone should be sad like me.
Honestly I'm just surprised Jacob took the plane from Tokyo to Osaka when the bullet train is right there at a fraction of the travel time and the ticket price. Yeah you really need to learn how public transit works my dude.  But man I'm glad that you enjoyed the trip and really got so much joy out of it.
More money = More happiness
That was really cool! It seems like he took the time to get gifts that his friends will actually enjoy! How sweet :)
I'm happy that you're happy!
1:29 wtf is the uk and Scotland both on there when Scotland is part of the uk
Manu!!!
I haven’t watched since the beginning, but I have been watching since 2016. I was in high school then. Now I’m in my last year of college and in a similar place mentally (Unsure of my future and my own happiness) But hearing your story and how happy you’ve been recently, it fills me with so much hope, and makes me happier hearing how happy you are ❤
God I wish that were me
anyone gonna mention that zoro got lost in the thumbnail lmaooo
11:14 Alpharad and PChal having a crazy enemies to lovers storyline 💀
Hey Alphared, please come visit China someday! We got the best McDonalds' in the world, and the best Spicy chicken sandwich and spicy wings!
Man, with how big youtube is this days, i dont really have the will to make a yt channel, but man, seeing how everyone started at 0 like everyone else, and watching your speech about how you began in this site, makes me want to make one like, right away, i've been watching your videos since forever, you're an actual inspiration, thanks jacob.
I suffered from the same issue around a year ago going to japan because my brother lives there now easily spent over 2000 bucks on anime stuff together with the food costs all i can say is i was BROKE
I was in line at the one piece store between you and Jaiden and I realized when I was leaving my store, it was literally the saddest day of my life.
11:13-11:15💀💀
I sob a little 🥲 the things you do like make them happy . I fucking love you (not gay) alpharad
The peak of your channel, honestly. Adorable conclusion :D
Long time viewer, first(ish) time commenter, I always thought you were pretty dang successful with all the content you’ve made. My favorite videos are always the ones where you are genuinely having the most fun, laughing the hardest, and sharing memories with friends. Like a lot of us getting through life while managing mental health, this video made me so incredibly happy to see you getting to celebrate your success with friends! Congratulations Jacob, that’s my goal to achieve that one day!! You’ve inspired me to keep chasing my dreams for years, and I hope to one day get to thank you in person. 🎉🙌🏽😁
beg to differ with aussie maccas being S tier lmao
You didn’t give smant his whooper 😮😮😮😤😤😤
It is a crime wolfey was only in this video for half a second
The plushies he bought are in the background
Its the lich
I'm so happy for you! Hearing that you got through these bad years and you are in a better place now makes me genuinely happy! After following all these years you've become a different person, but in the end a genuinely good guy, dear friend of his friends. I hope i get there some day too
No way you put uk maccies on A tier 💀
I didn't expect to tear up at the end ahh❤❤❤
Sanji-san
Glad too see Australia is at the top of the McDonalds tier list. Thanks, Mate!
To sum up the end of this video: Jacob is an absolute sweetheart and his friends are so incredibly lucky
To be honest alpharad, I only watch the videos where you travel, which has been like 3? But I love you and your videos
1:31 he made Scotland and the UK separate places on the tier list… Scotland is IN the UK
You are so lucky to have friends and be able to hang out with them and have fun experiences with them and even have the choice to go travel to Japan and have a better lifestyle currently and be happy in life and enjoy all of the experiences and moments you get to spend with family and friends. Don't take everything for granted and have a nice time and enjoy life! ❤
As an Australian… literally none of this made sense to me, but it was still funny I guess?
Holy sit it ultraman in 7elleven
This is awesome 😊
0:54 this meme never fails to let me giggle.
been watching your content for the past 8 years, you're one of the best out there. glad you're doing well and that you're happy doing what you do. ❤
15:29  manu/ohara
Jacob is just great.  I hope to be at that kinda place in life. Friends, happy,......money Proud of your growth man.
NETHERLANDS C TIER WTF
Christ almighty, may the pokemon Gods save you
Wow. This took a turn, I came into this expecting a normal chronicling your trip style video with (of course) obscene amounts of money being spent or merch. And then it just became the most wholesome thing I’ve seen on the internet, hearing view on life and seeing how happy everyone is extremely refreshing. Just genuinely making people happy is my favorite thing about Jacob , so thank you to him and his team for being so dedicated and I’m glad your happy Jacob.💙
The cost of getting these suitcases checked in had to be as big as the money spent on merch lol.
21:24 we all know what he got
This.. this made me happy🥺
You really show me that it matters what you want and to never talk about being broke, even when broke. I hope you love selling as much as I do.
The ending is genuinely so heartwarming
That last section may be the most wholesome, wonderful thing I’ve seen on YouTube in a long time. That was wonderful.☺️
Brooo I hate McDonald’s in AUS and it’s the highest on the list, Jesus Christ I feel bad for everyone else what is McDonald’s everywhere else like I’m so curious if it’s literal dumpster food
Don't Think I Didn't See That
You are not only an great example of a YouTuber, you’re a great example of who a person should be, and who a friend should be.
How is alpha just gonna casually drop the most eye opening speech ever in a video about him falling under the curse of consumerism and capitalism
I'm cry, such a sweet dude
Does anyone know the song at 16:24? I’ve heard it so many times but my brain cannot locate what it is 🫠
My goal is to make enough money to spoil my friends 🥹
We just going to gloss by you frenching PokemonChallenges
i love how this demonstrates how much he knows about his friend group, every single one was stuff they all loved
It's really sweet of you to mail all these gift to your friends!!
5:30 i got that same plushie for free because of a deal :)
PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME WHO IS THE PERSON WITH THE OMORI PAD IN THEIR DESK!!!! PLZZZZZ
Zoro lost in the thumbnail 😂
bro did you randomly make out with a dude
Ok I just stumbled across this but this got me tearing up so badly seeing how fun Japan was and then the kindness giving the stuff you bought to your friends 😭
I was here for the japan video with Jacob but it's a nice character growth😌
God this vid is so amazing, the end was so cute 😋. I wish I had friends
Bro I am sorry but the fucking persona ost during this is killing me. Like great musix options don't get me wrong, but for alpha to be opening up then out of no where for strikers music bursting through it made me laugh my ass off. I rewatched the portion don't worry and glad you are happy man.
we are proud of u jacob
if you go back sometime in the future again you can mail back boxes of stuff back to your address so you dont have to have 8 suitcases XD but very sweet getting all your friends stuff
15:08 is what I was wondering about how he got sponsored this entire time lmao. But happy for you and your friends!
he likes weed cat alot
11:14 okay wow
the end was so sweet omg!!
The little boy thinking you were sanji killed me🤣
They should put you into YouTube’s hall of fame
yo dude make another omega strikers video
Man spends thousands of dollars in Japan just to give back to all of the people who helped him make the Alpharad brand i started watching your videos alpha back Before Smash ultimate and seeing you do this made my heart melt thank you for all of the years of entertainment you have brought me and my brother
Made me so happy when you said you're happy. I've been watching you since middle school and now I'm in my second year of college. You've come so far man.
11:14 EXCUSE ME?
Lmao weird how this place was enslaving  people like 80 years ago and now it’s this….keeping doing your own thing Japan
JACOB, YOU COULD BUY A TASTEFULY DECORRATED ONE STORY HOUSE, WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU SPENT ON THIS TRIPPPP
“Let’s monetize my obsessive qualities.”
the end where you gifted your friends presents is so heartwarming!! so sweet🫶🫶
I think the reason why us Americans and American-adjacent people like Japan so much is because they openly love the things they love. Japan just has stuff they like everywhere. I mean you can go into Seven Eleven and get Manga. Let’s say I wanted to buy an American made book, where could I go? The library, a book store, but most likely I’d have to order it online, I couldn’t just go to seven eleven. I want to buy a Kirby plush? I’d be hard pressed to even find one in a toy store. Only the absolute most mainstream stuff that appeals to kids (like Minecraft, Fortnite, etc) can be found here, and even that’s rare (plus it’s marketed directly to children). Japan isn’t afraid to be passionate about the things they like, and I think that’s the reason why we look at Japan like it’s some mythical dreamland, because we want to be in a place where we can be passionate without the fear of judgement.
I went to Japan earlier this year and spent about 300 AUD at one of the general pokemon centres. I can't imagine how much I'd spend if I went to this event with so much exclusive merch 😅
Genuinely surprised coney isn’t shown getting anything
OMG YOU WERE IN MINATOMIRAI!?!?!?!?!? COME ON I WOULD'VE TOTALLY GIVEN YOU A TOUR!!!!!!!!!!
Your journey through your career in YouTube hit hard in a way I wasn't expecting, especially with the timing of it all. I'm glad you're in a good spot and giving back!
SINCE WHEN DID JACOB NOW OHARA???????????
Honestly I can see myself going straight to McDonald’s with out a second to think.
HE SAID WHAT WAS IN 7-ELEVEN
I live on Oahu, Hawaii and even if the 7-Elevens here aren't as grand they are still a place of wonder where we get full meals and such. Also, you playing kingdom hearts music during your serious part killed me 😭
9:38 Alpha jaiden what are you doing Jaiden me and my therapist just vibing and taking photos Alpha thats a polar bear Jaiden his name is cucurocho
21:28 JC Players is now officially sponsored, in part, by Nintendo
Gaah im so jealous looks like fun aaaa, dont worry id buy tons too when i go somewhere amazing to spend it, you bet i fucking do! Lol plus i love getting stuff  for my friends and family ❤  Honestly thoo 711 is always awesome, at least for me, but I hope i can go to japan someday  This is so cool. i can tell you loved it lots. im glad :]  Im glad ive been along for the ride from the start of ur chnl and i hope one day i can do what i want and live my life and be happy  and enjoy my job and hope i can do more for my pals and thats so sweet you gifting your pals! That was so heartwarming i teard up  This entier vid made me so happy!! Ommggg aaa
11:14 we stan a bisexual Queen
This video legitmately put a smile on my face. Im glad you got to share the love with your friends, and that youre happy with your life now. 💚💚💚
I just discovered you and I loved the video!
We love a bisexual king 💚💚💚
11:14
9:53 surprise elden ring reference
711 have porn 💀📸
7:15 none of it matters if you die tomorrow
did you do the crane games with cdawgva? i saw him in the video so i was wondering
Ohara?
Jacob this is fucking amazing. I'm so happy you're finally in a happy space mentally because you've helped me over the years when I'm having a hard time. Watching you give your friends all this stuff really warmed my heart and I'm just so happy for you.
Seeing Jacob talk about everything takes me down memory lane of 3 months ago when I went and I want to go back.
What a wholesome end!! Just giving all the love back to your friends  Banger video as always man!
bro got sponsored by the biggest media company in the world
Play will you snail . You can make your own map in the game.
You are awesome
Gotta say, the Magnemite Jacob made looks really happy and I kinda hope they make a card based off of it
Jacob sounds like me when I discovered the Kinnikuman store. It was a struggle to limit to one purchase, that store was almost a serious problem
11:14 w
that last part got me emotional ngl omg
cute.
Not me getting into my miku cosplay while watching this 💀💀💀💀
i love this so much
wth does dulingo have sukuna markings lol
it was so heart warming to see all his friends react to the gifts that he got them and I don't even know these people Alpharad must be to the moon with the emotions! Way to go pal!
WT FREAK ALPH! U KISSED A GUY!
9:38 CUCURUCHOOOOOOOOOOOOO ❤
5:57 : Meet the gambler
That ending was so wholesome. Also Jo's setup is hilarious
1:31 SCOTLAND ISNT SEPARATE FROM THE UK
We need alpharad to play the fake sanji once return to sabaody gets made in live action
What happened in Hawaii?
i love pointcrow
This is my new favourite video from you it’s just the sweetest thing ever 😭💖
You sat next to me at that Korean Restaurant in Shibuya and I agree that food was so damn good! Great video man!
11:14 - W H A T
11:14 ...
most inspiring video i've watched in years
07:47 Léo 7:50 Léo e Luba
From How to 101's to How to Be Bankrupt Because of Licensed/Themed Merch 101. Good to see how far you've come Mr. Rad
Broo i NEED TO JUST GO THROUGH SITTING CUTIES PLUSHES FOR MY FAVES
@11:10 who was he drinking shots with OO
First comment asking Jacob to cosplay Sanji
Wow that ending though  I hope Alpha kept SOMETHING for himself
Now I'm convinced you need to cosplay Sanji  Because now that you mention it I can't unsee it   Tbh the kid being so excited is kind of wholesome in a way
tfw the Pokemon company sends your roommate all of the sitting cuties. And then YOU buy all of the sitting cuties. And then you have two rooms dedicated to sitting cuties.
ONEPIECE CREW
Literally one of my favorite alpharad videos
Did you fucking french kiss Jan ?
I almost cried at end man, you're such a beatiful person Jacob
Glad you are doing well
“Oh my god, I love her!” I also fell in love with Ogerpon literally immediately, she’s so baby :,)
My GOAT
The mic is a little messed up
1:31  scotland at A tier is so real honestly
Man’s the goat
alpha. i cannot believe that you are also an Anri fan. i am so happy. i hope you enjoyed the circuit of rainbow show.
Favorite YouTuber Alpharad discovering himself and feeling better? Yeah, I'm thinking we're back
It's such a touching feeling when the people who help you grow and develop as a person. You show them how much you care about them for all there efforts
こんにちは、アルファラド
I'm happy to see that liking and subscribing has led to this
I need the video of Jan singing karaoke
PLZ TELL ME IN TOTAL HOW MUCH HE PAID IN YEN PLZ SOMEONE DO THE CALCULATIONS
I'm glad I subscribed to the sweetest guy around.
Glad you found happiness Jacob ☺️
Yeah I kinda forgot he can go to the west to get to Japan instead of a world tour
Pokemon Company probably made more money from the people they sent to japan than they actually spent getting them there.
ポケモン好きの日本人として、こんなに日本を楽しんでくれて嬉しいです。また遊びにきてね
i need to cry
I'm going to Japan next month and I knew I was gonna spend money while I was there but my god now I'm both a lot more excited and a lot more scared of what will happen while I'm there 😭😭
Never expected to have my mod be in a alpharad video lmao
10:59 he looks so ridiculously happy there it's almost unsettling🤣
9:56 I am scared, help, want an adult, he looks like he just watched every episode of One Piece...help💀
The ending legitimately made me cry lmao, to love and be loved by friends and to remember so many things about them is so sweet and amazing. I aspire to be that friend. Thank you for the years and once again, amazing video!
I'm just happy for you man.  No amount of words.
You would think the price of being a content creator would be worth it for all of that..."the anxiety never gets better"
Alpharad has experienced "fifty shades of hangovers" on this single trip.
You're awesome man
way to flex on going to an Anri concert got dam im so jealous.
Going to japan was the most humbling experience ever, cuz now anytime I see ANYTHING i want to buy at all I think about the things I DIDNT buy in japan that were way better
As a person who has watched Jacob for a while it makes me happy to see him thrive and admit he’s happy. I watched him a lot growing up and based some of my humor off of him. Glad you had a fantastic time in Japan!
I wish I had as good of friends as you Jacob. Your friend group is amazing and you all have love and respect for each other, it's amazing! And that was a lot of money spent in Japan huh lol
:)))
Thanks for the inspiration mate, this video sums up all I want for my life. I'm very happy for you, despite we don't know each other. Thanks for bringing all your content! :)
11:14 💀
It makes me so happy to see Jacob happy because it’s always upsetting to see when the thing you love makes other people upset and you should always take care of yourself   But what REALLY HIT ME HARD IN THIS VIDEO  I also have a massive friend group who I love giving gifts to so this video just all around got me ❤❤❤❤  Keep being you Jacob you’re amazing 💪💪💪💪💪💪
This video cemented Jacob as my favorite internet funnyman on youtube and its not even close Godspeed
Man, I don’t know what to say but watching this video as someone that has been following you closely on youtube since the beginning of the How to 101 series really feels great, I’m so glad all of that adventure and risky path brought you to what you are now and how you are feeling about yourself now. It feels good to see someone that brought you several hundreds or even more than a thousand hours of content is doing that great and is also surrounded by so many great friends. Enjoy your life as much as you can!! We’ll enjoy that too through your videos and also from streams !!!
That's why he's the GOAT
1:31 jacob seperated scotland and the uk based as hell
BRO IS LIVING THE DREAM
I’m depressed, so I’m happy that you’re happy😂
Anyone notice zoro got lost again in the start of the photo?yeh?
15:29 is that Ohara the One Piece YouTuber???   That looks like Ohara and I'm not sure if it is.
New fear unlocked: bank account after Japan
11:14 putting this single frame in my wallet… :)
It's adorable that a little kid mistook you for Sanji from One Piece.
11:14?!?!? Lmao
Wish I could be rich as Alpha Rad! I would've NEVER left! 😭
he made _con_ tent but was he con _tent_
Jeeze we finally got Jacobs redemption arc 18:55
He really played the long con making us thinking he was a massive spender that couldn’t hold himself back
Omg, I teared up a bit at the footage of your friends. That's is soo fantastic!
Been there
The end of this video made me genuinely emotional.
Zoro getting lost in the thumbnail 😭 Also 5:00 got me 😂
Uhhhhh 11:14
As someone who just came back from Japan and got the same sprigatito and dragonair plush, Japan indeed swallows you’re wallet. Everything is just branded and cute to kingdom come
If there was an American game that was big as Pokémon, No American city would be covered with stuff like this. That's just the effort Japan takes with these events
Ngl I teared up when you said you were finally happy. I’ve been watching your videos since 2017 and your videos have helped me through rough times. Thank you for everything
Love you so much Jacob you deserve all your subs and the friends you’ve made along the way with your YouTube channel. Been watching since 2018 during a rough month of my life your content cheered me up a lot ❤
I want to visit, but I don't have the money to go T-T (Plane tickets and unhealthy spending habits)
Ever since I found your channel in 2016 via the Pokemon Sun videos, I have been a fan of yours ever since. It's honestly surreal seeing this video and how much you and the channel have grown. Good job.
I came for the "Not series", but stayed long enough to see you grow. This is soo wholesome, I literally cried at the end. You are such an inspiration, thank you for excisting! :)
The News 39 off vocal as video bgm was so surprising but so pleasant LMAO
7/11 is hype in japan... but tbh, family mart's fami chicken is even better, i highly suggest it.
alpha just realised a lot os my dreams in this video … the trip, the shopping but mostly  the kiss …
Mr. Jacob Alpharad. That was insanely inspiring and being able to provide so much to all your friends was insanely so cool and is something I’ve always dreamt of doing myself one day with my own family and friends.  Your heartfelt words about your journey resonated with me in a wag that I just genuinely appreciated, the honesty to recognize the luxuries you have and to make the most of it is something I absolutely respect.  Hearing you also say that the work you put in YouTube was directly proportional to your success reassured me so much that what I’m doing with my own career is worthwhile.  I hope you and Jan share more beautiful drunk karaoke kisses.  That’s everything I wanted to share. I hope we can have a real conversation one day lol.
But HOW does one bring all that stuff back home?? Like the extra fees at the airport must be insane (I never flew before so idk anything about it)
Honestly why feel bad about spending sm money on things you ACTUALLY enjoy??  Like thats one of the reasons why ppl save money in the first place!  I wish I could go to Japan and spend some of my money, get gifts for firends, sightseeing and experience their culture!!
The fact Jacob knows his friends so well, and got each of them something they genuinely loved, really speaks VOLUMES of his character! He's got to be one of the most genuine people I've ever known of; a true saint! Thank you for continuing to bless your fans with content, and for just always being such an amazing person 🙏
I just came back from 2 weeks in japan. 1 week osaka. 1 week tokyo. And i fell in love with  japan.  Its great
7 eleven. Family mart. Lawson. The triforce of japan.
sponsoring this video was such a good investment, they immediately made their money back through you spending all your money on pokemon merch
For my feeble little adhd brain this would be overstimulation af, even watching this is making me go insane
this dude is an actual saint. he’s been going through a lot mentally then pulls shit like this?! you’re insane jacob!!! keep being amazing!!
Watching people pop off getting some of their new favorite things brings a smile to my face. You’re a good man and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.  Remember to take time off when you need it. Traditional work has annual leave for a reason.
oh no
Like a lot of people I almost cried. Crazy to think it's been almost 10 years since the start and I've been one of the lucky ones to have seen this ride through ups and downs, really glad it's all been going up for you Jacob. Also thanks for reminding me how important my friends are and that it is important to show them the appreciation they deserve.    Also loved seeing 3 of the 4 FWOB boys!
Progress takes sacrifice, you sacrificed a lot to get where you are now you can reap the rewards. I’m jealous, enjoy it
Alpha’s shirt game was fuckin sick this video. Dripped as hell
That ending almost got me crying. That's so wholesome. Glad you are doing great! You deserve it all :)
Cool
Does anyone know the music at 4:43 ???
11:14 so uh you seem pretty wasted there huh
NO WAYYY! Yuka Morii has been my favorite card creator ever since i started playing in 2013!!!!
Ok somebody gotta draw Alpharad as Sanji
Jacob, I’m so happy to hear that you are happy. It means so much to be close with good people and the love you have for them and for making videos is definitely the reason your channel has been so successful, because that love you put in definitely comes through in the quality of your content. That’s what’s kept me watching all these years and it makes me really happy to hear that you’ve been able to feel that joy for yourself!
Real talk
Holy fuck, as a Mexican, I can't even begin to imagine how awful McDonalds is in another countries if we're A tier, its one of our shittiest chains, hell, I don't a single person that likes likes their burgers, just the ice cream, nuggies and maybe fries.  Edit: now I feel kinda silly leaving that comment in such a heartwarming video but that's life.
Bro Jacob did a master mind like plan for Japan to make everyone happy and then make this wholesome vid... I can't dawg, I swear...
Every time you post an update video it warms my heart. I finally feel like I’m at a place where I’m happy too, so seeing you have it in your video means so much to me man. I don’t know if I’m projecting or some shit especially cause I don’t know you but my god it makes me so happy. Thank you for making this bro.
"Things that don't matter, do [matter] as long as they make you happy." This is such an amazing quote. Thanks for this one.
Enemies to lovers was not what i expected but i love it so much
It sounds like Jacob feels like he didn't accomplish much when he grinded really hard for 7 years, but that grind made the channel blow up and turn into the money machine that allows these kinds of trips to happen.  It paid off in the end.
Jacob, you are one of the nicest people I have seen in my life. Not only did you give away most (if not ALL) your purchases, but you also have us laughing, crying, and staying with you the entire way. Love the content and you can do you! We love you! 🫶
As an Australian, I can agree that maccas is good here but still tastes like animal poo
I can not unsee after the kid called him sanji lol
This is like the dark souls of spending for Alpharad LOL
I know he didnt but in my head cannon alpharad just got pointcrow porn and nothing else
Song at 10:50 ???
See, some people say this video is to flex his money, some people to say it’s to hilight how kind he is. I say neither, this video is because he got back, saw his bank account, and really needs to be able to write this off in his taxes.
jacob speaks like a cosplayer
Aside from you going through what I think is just about every Pokemon fan's dream holiday, being mistaken for Sanji is absolutely amazing LMAO that's so cute
The last like 10 minutes is just the greenest flag I think I've seen for someone
11:14
1:13 new pokemon: Maushood
hell yeah!
7:47 Luba spotted
Those 4 frames alpha... i saw that. Sly dog.
Super wholesome, this made my day man. I hope that one day I can have an adventure like yours. Excited to see you in the next video, buddy! <3
As someone who's recently traveled abroad, it's very deceptively easy to spend a ton of money when using different currency
11:14 just 11:14
I gotta say, this is the third time in two days that I've watched this video. Good job :)
oh wow all of that looks so fun  if i were to go to japan id spend so much money on miku and rin merch lolll
Having just visited Japan this summer, it is incredible. This was my first time out of the country and it was amazing. I went to Okinawa and Tokyo, and if you're looking for a destination for your NEXT Japan trip, go to Okinawa, its magical just like Tokyo. I hope you had an amazing time in Tokyo, and congrats!
11:14 JACOB DON'T THINK I DIDN'T SEE THAT!!! AMAZING FANSERVICE.
maybe the one peice was the happiness we found along the way
Please someone tell me what book he is holding at 23:26
When are you and Jaiden getting together?
the world loves you
Aw that ending!
11:14    Won’t say anything else
You're not a YouTube millionaire... you're a YouTube one in a million. Youre the best out of millions!
Dude, how can you make me cry laughting, cry on happiness for you and cry over such a wholesome moment at the end??? Wft Jacob  and btw I KNEW IT 11:14
Goddammit Alpha, that emotional section actually hit way too hard but I'm so glad you've been happier Alpharad ❤❤❤
knowing so much was bought for friends makes me feel like @11:55 you had a list just to keep track and thats so fuckin wholesome
Genuinely started to cry at how happy everyone was with the gifts. Jacob really knows his friends so well
10:13 keeping this for myself
If you need to put them anywhere buy a second house or a warehouse and just display them
Man that one bit with Dragonair hit hard cause I'm that nut job who decided to Shiny hunt Dratini in XY via Chain Fishing.
Hope you get stay happy and healthy!
Okay wait. You got a personal clay class from YUKA MORII?!?!?
Jacob Alpharad being the most wholesome individual on the internet has and always will be one of my favorite things ever.
My future  strategy is to look for a shipping company and just ship my souvenirs
The fact that he returned from the trip without going bankrupt is a feat within itself.
Man it’s been super cool to see your changes as a content creator, you’ve done so much amazing biz it’s truly inspiring. You’re easily my favorite creator on this platform and I love watching all your vids. From what you show you seem like a really genuine guy and a good friend which is really nice to see. Keep doing what you’re doing man as long as it makes you happy we’re happy too!  Also that was a passionate kiss at 11:14 💀
A very good video
I’m not crying you’re crying!!!
Swablu :)
23:38 *I wanna Marshal plushie, too!* 😭
The dubbing is really putting this in the uncanny valley
May I have permission to be openly jealous in a healthy capacity!!?
It's been a long time since i've had tears of joy and a slight bit of jealousy at the same time like this. What i wouldn't give to have such a good friend who pays so much attention to those around him🙏🏻  The bit with social anxiety, i feel that. The sad part, it really resonated within me. Not knowing if the path you're walking is the one you want to walk, but feeling like you can't really just abandon it either.   In the off chance you somehow see this, remember you're not alone. I wish you nothing but the best, mr. Rad
docterrr pepperrrr
s tier video, will watch many times again  thank you alpharad :)
The fascination with american restaurants  in other countries is absolutely valid. Especially with how much they can vary (Pizza Hut being a good example with the shit ton of toppings different countries have)
Alpharad, it's a personal goal of mine to one day go to Japan and buy a ton of anime merch! You are living my dream! Seriously though, I'm glad you got to enjoy your trip. I'm sure your friends greatly appreciate you for giving them those gifts. A great video overall.
The Shibuya incident all over again
11:14 Truly a rivals to lovers story for the ages, AO3 could never
As one of my favorite creators of all time it’s great to see that you’re enjoying your life! You absolutely deserved this trip for al the amazing video’s you’ve put out troughout the years! 👑
mf said china town in japan 😂😂😂 no wonder they hate us
I'm a minor but damn am i excited to have money to spend on this
Best YouTuber of the decade hands down
This video makes me wanna become a youtuber so I can fund all these shananigans myself
ayyyyyyyyye yyyooooooo 11:13 some thing sus there
This is the best video for Jan X Alpha shippers, just go to 11:14
Actually beautiful video, especially the second half. A treasure to watch.
many, many of your videos make me happy, and i enjoy pretty much every single one, but this one is special. thanks for everything alpha, keep living your best life :)
My anti-social ass could legitimately never
wholesome
I’m so glad you’re happy man, that’s all that matters, cuz you can have so much stuff, but if you’re not happy with yourself and in general, what’s the point, take care and happy that you enjoy your trip to the fullest 💕💃💕
What was in pointcrows box huh?
You heard what she said subscribe or you’re cringe
Alpharad is Sanji confirmed
Alpharad of you need a two month to three month break you can tell us we won't be sad or dissapointed
I wanna go there so bad!  But I can't because it costs money
A huge tug on my heart strings for sure. This was so wholesome and awesome of you to do. I'm glad you had so much fun in Japan and thank you for sharing it with us! <3
Such a beautiful soul Jacob, we appreciate you and love seeing your content. This was well deserved!
You can probably call it a wrongfully usage of your intellectual powers, over consumption of work makes you unbalanced and you should probably start meditating time to time. And try to force yourself to be bored! Hehe maybe I’m not great at explaining but keeping your mind soul and spirit healthy and feel better all over mediation is the best! Maybe you should go to Japan again and do it for your mental health and visit shrines and such. Hehe nice video hehe 😅
I hate the feeling of leaving Japan. My heart breaks because it is so beautiful, and whimsical.
Going to Japan is the final boss for your wallet
At first I thought that Alpharad just spent a mega ton of money on himself and I was in shock and then at the end when I saw that he gave a massive majority of the stuff too his friends it was so wholesome and really nice of him. Amazing video alpharad from begging to end. Keep doing the thing
yooo great content as always and glad u are doing well remember that ur health first than others
BRO WAS MACKING LIPS WITH SOMEONE AND JUST WENT RIGHT IVER IT I WAS IN SHOCK XD
I came to this video expecting poor financial decisions (which granted, yes there was a lot of) but I didn't expect to get a small peek into your enormous heart, and genuinely after hearing you say "I'm happy," it made me tear up. I've been watching your content from Villager 101 to now and since then, watching you grow into someone that I look up to and strive to be like one day, hearing that you're living a life that feels good and exciting and free; that makes me so happy beyond anything. I'm so happy for you dude, that life really feels okay and that things are doing better. I had the biggest smile for the last like 10 minutes of the video just watching everyone be so excited and thankful. Just know that parasocially, we love you dude and we're all proud of what you're doing and who you've become. Keep doing what makes you happy <3
AND I ALMOST CRIED AT THE END
Does anyone else remember Alpharad supporting Nairo, a pedophile, and helping him escape the consequences of his actions by backing a phantom document which says he didnt have sex with a 15 year old twice? Even though he already admitted to it?? Crazy times
I want to be able to spend with such abandon. 🥲
That looks so fun! :0
Yo quiero tio
11:14  That is all
..did Jaiden get another joltik plush loo
I'm legitimately surprised Double  Big Mac isn't a thing in America. It's been a regular menu item here  in canada since the 90s.
Does anyone have the streams where people opened stuff? I want to see how happy they get!!
Has it been really almost 8 years? Dang. Im so proud of alpha... Such a wholesome amazing youtuber. I just been crying at the end such a sweetheart...
Dude I cried such a great video
Now you gotta do a sanji cosplay just for the Hilarity of the fan interaction
8:13 *Jujutsu kaisen flashbacks*
wait. you're friends with Ohara?
7:48 o @lubatv ali no canto que bonitinho kkkkkkkk
Best video ever
well looks like that was some well spent money XD
No way... I was on that flight lmao, but we had to take a transfer flight to Hiroshima after landing in Haneda Airport, what are the odds of that lol.
Alpharad: "I spent way too much money on this!"  Anyone who has watched any of his other videos: "We know."
Did he mean to put that one picture? 💀
Sanji-San!
TL:DW; Alpharad goes to Japan courtesy of Pokémon and spends a ton of money.
11:17 he kissed a man
Jacob getting super drunk was PokémonChallenges fault. 100%.
What was that @ 11:14?! 👀👀😳
well i mean if the card pack is only japan exclusive, buying it online for that price is probably cheaper than flying over there and getting it yourself
This was so much fun to watch. It was awesome seeing the joy on everyone's faces
I hope this man is on trash taste soon
big fan of the sneaky make out session in there, truly in the spirit of preparing for another awards show at the end of the year
The fact that in 9:49 there are 'made in USA' tags in Japan just makes this place cement itself as a different dimension.  *and no one will tell me otherwise.*
What alpharad has is shiny object symptom
9:16 *gasp!*
What song is at 6 mins
Nuh uh
Oh my god it's Sanji from the channel Alpharad
15:32 connor lmao
did pointcrow get 7eleven porn 😂
Alpharad is a fucking inspiration, he built it up to all be for his treasure horde when really it was all a gift, he did it all for his buddies, and still ended up having a great time.
Jacob i just want to say I also have social anxiety and just hearing that someone gets me just made my day and also love your videos.
What a video to return to watching with... I haven't always kept up with your stuff and this has been on and off my recommended for the last day or so and tbh it's an amazing one to return to watching you with. Hearing you say you're happy made me smile wide. Kudos, my man. The gifts to your friends was such a wonderful turn to cap it all off, congratulations on your career and the amazing people you call friends, looking forward to seeing where your journey takes you from here!
seeing all these alpharad videos the moment you talk about burn out made me nostalgic, but it felt solemn. Thank you for nearly 10 years of alpharad. Been watching since how to villager, hope you continue to live your life to the fullest.   P.S. shout out to Mad Dawg idk why thats the 1st old alpharad memory in my mind but it is
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T GET THE MEWTWO RAID YET??? I HAD TO DO MORE RAIDS???
Alpharad and jan enemies to lovers
you deserve so much alpha, your content is genuinely so cool and your progress has been insane to watch, so much love for you and your friends
SPLATOON MENTIONED!!!!!
Would love to do this for my people
Jacob you are a treasure, respect for spending all that on your friends
You are such a sweet heart  ♡
very nice video Sanji-san, really liked the ending bit where you gifted your streamer friends, wholesome as H
The persona music hits so different in this video
i was crying with the last 10 minutes wholesome moment and then you just appreciate your friends giving gifts to them!!! you´re awesome alpha :'D
At 16:24 could someone please tell me the name of the song playing?
What was the song at 6:00?
Ok I’m sorry but I swear I saw Jacob making out with Jan
this is so wholesome :)
holy shit alpha this video genuinely had me crying you deserve the best man we all love you <333 (also the sanji kid seemed so adorable)
Odd how much time energy and money they spend on all of this but so little on their games.  They noticed you so they must have seen tons of people complaining about how lackluster their games are
11:14 didnt know sanji swaped sides
Youtube video of the fucking year right here. Definitely needed to get a good bit of crying out of my system ❤
good for alpharad doing this he is had a nice time
let me ask you this, do you Tracking your flight can be as easy as one click with
11:14 ALPHA MAKING OUT WITH JO?!
Ultraman in Alpharad?!? Now that’s a dream come true
Alpharad just brings me so much joy after nearly 7 years of watching and seeing him grow, its got me teared up how he’s giving back to the people he loves. I can only find myself feeling inspired and having admiration for this man.
If I ever feel like I’m spending to much money I’ll just watch this video
Dudeee the persona music is such a nice detail
i need a full compilation just of his friends unpacking the boxes, man that second hand endorphine is the best.
The video was great and I had the biggest smile on my face watching people opening their gifts at the end.
Kid really just called you Sanji from one piece
This video was beautefull all the way till the end.  I'm also happy you wher able to take some time off and enjoy your trip!
I have to answer the question you posed in the video: I would buy everything for them. I would not be where I am without my friends and family.
You said "Needless to say," and then I accidentally clicked "0" on my numpad so it went to the start and you said "I've never been to Japan before". It genuinely sounded convincing.
Miku, Miku
Side note from the wholesomeness, I love how everyone is showing off their stuff you got them then there’s pointcrow with the “I can’t show this 😳” Jacob what did you DO lmfao
11:14 👀👀👀
2:07 日本語上手ですね
23:45
11:45 you probably have enough to fill a bookshelf that would rival  Jayden's poke plush wall😂
Take care Mr. Worldwide AlphaRad
11:13 caught in 4k
I❤men kissing
the fact i saw people try and shit on jacob for “flexing” before even watching this. This video isnt just cool, it’s SO sweet!
I feel this movie so much😂 Ive saved up for years to finally get a 3 weeks vacation.  It was such a blast!
How do we sign up for this trip ourselves?
A little fun fact in case most people kinda noticed it, Yokohama Japan (according to a brief google search) runs on 50hz electric instead of 60hz like the US does. Most electricity is AC (alternating current) that turns on and off so quickly you don’t notice it, it’s more efficient that DC (direct current) which is used in low voltage electronics. Hz is hertz that means rotations for 60, so 50hz is 50 times per second and 60hz would be 60. This means that if you are used to an area that has 60hz you may notice the quick flickering of lights in areas that have 50hz typically overseas.
The end was so heartwarming. Oh my god, Jacob, you're so sweet
Goddamn it jacob, youre such a good friend ❤️
"If you don't subscribe then you're cringe." You know what, I'm sick and tired of all these spoiled brats completely out of touch with the general population. I buy Youtube Premium to avoid ads, and yet I get bombarded nonstop by sponsored ads or by demands to give money to their Patreon. Enough is enough, I'm done with Youtube personalities.
I don't know why I started crying when everyone started showing off their gifts.
konnichiwhat’s up alpharad
Can somebody tell me how much he spent in this video? I lost count.
Whats the song that starts at 20:50? 🥰
💗
Alpharad living the dream!
as someone who went to Japan for 2 weeks around the same time as you did (like, my second week was your first week) and also had the most fun I have ever had, this video made me genuinely happy! Definitely resubscribing
You did good hope you had a fantastic trip
I what to go to japan
YOU WENT TO THE NETHERLANDS ??
Hey alpharad, how is Jaiden doing? She hasn’t posted on her YouTube much. She must be streaming.
15:41 FUSHIGURO
rotom vacuum cleaner
Alpha trying too justify pokemon scams
11:14 T-W-A-HUH?
日本动漫确实好，就是思想太变态了
Just wanna say you rock! The trip to Japan looks absolutely incredible, the stuff of dreams but it's admirable that you've taken the time to show love to the people you care about. I'm glad you're happy and that things have turned around for the best. It was heartwarming to see everyone's reactions. Your hard earned money comes from your dedication for the craft and it's totally valid to want to spend on yourself and friends. Keep up the good work and take care of yourself!
thanks pokemon
I love Alpharads videos but sometimes him talking about a trip he did become my favorites 🤣 you get to see that he genuinely enjoyed something and is telling all his subscribers about it, which is really special
11:15 Don't think we didn't see that, that's what I call a goood night
11:14
the end of this video is so wholesome, I'm so proud of how far you've come Jacob. To express that you're happy, genuinely happy is so important and takes A LOT OF WORK and I'm glad that you've made peace with that! My friends also mean the world to me and I wouldn't be here without them, so hearing you express this same sentiment got me a little emotional. You're such an amazing content creator and I hope you understand just how great you are because this was amazing. Keep up the great work dawg
I love your content I am so sorry you have gone through those times but to see you say you were finally happy made me very happy.
Well That is good enough for my broke butt . see other people buy stuff
Me: Wow, this was an awesome video! Shame that it's over though. Also me: Wait, there are 12 minutes left..
Honestly, no offense but you should’ve used wayyyy more persona music.
You Might Never See This, but this is literally my dream life you are living, one day i wanna be like you, i want a huge community that is supportive and nice and be able to make money through what i enjoy. My family isn't the richest so ive never really been able to buy my friends gifts, but somewhere in the future i want to make them the biggest gift they've received. When i first found your channel i never thought i'd be seeing such a big idol in my life in you, currently I am considering face revealing because my pc is terrible and can't record (my graphics driver died) but i am also scared of making the move, not even alpharad, but anyone who reads this, do you think i should make the move and do like skit videos?
that last section is the most wholesome thing ever
Sobbing rn, this is the kind of stuff I do when I go to cons, or even just scrolling amazon or etsy. I'm just like "Omg that's so cool...My sister would love that, lemme get it."
Love the thumbnail and your videos! So thank you Sanji san! 😂😂
W
Quite surprised that I didn’t see the onix clip, ngl. 💜
Jacob doing good mentally after 10 years of content grinding AND some of the most heartwarming shit I seen this year?  🙏🙏 makes me glad we have people like him
The Pokemon Company knew that they were making money with all the merch bought when they contacted Alpha, smart move Pokemon
11:14 ???HELLOO
Homeboy spent more in a week than I make in a year but at least he made at all his friends happy with it so I forgive him for his sins :)
Hey Alpha, look at all the friends and connections you have now! That's amazing.
Alpha, I’m happy that you were able to take this trip and get the experience to see more of the World and more importantly you’ve been taking time to assess your mental health to reach a more positive state of mind. I am always an advocate for taking no time for yourself to do what you have to self care for yourself. I do love your videos and hope that you will be able to take more pleasant trips like this and see the world.
All I got from this video is that I need to save more for my trip to japan. 😭😭😭 and a list of people I’m getting gifts for and a list of my fav Pokémon
Science Museum referenced W
I only watched this video thanks to pchal and alpharad kissing for a single frame.
You deserve it man! We’re all glad you had so much fun, and heres to hoping many (well, for the sake of your wallet, not MANY-) more experiences like this in your future!
I love the video all of it
10:57 what the title idiot
I am currently in Japan for the first time as well, and this video resonates a lot with me lol. Going home in a couple of days, gonna be sad.
omg someone tell me where i can get that shanks jacket
At 20:56, this video became one of the greatest videos you’ve ever done. Seeing how happy your friends were, absolute joy! Again, thanks for sharing!
The end of the video made me cry, happy to see you enjoying  life man, you've an amazing group of friends and they have an incredible frienship w you
Thank you for sharing. Keep on trucking. We will be here. Take time to love yourself. :)
It’s just him flexing about how much money he spent
5:08 btw that image is pretty outdated, there are WAY more connections now
2:34 it seems to be a common theme among alpha, me, and the group chat, that 7-eleven is the holy land for americans in japan
ive never laughed so hard at the word mcdonalds
This only verifies that I am vastly underestimating how much money I'm gonna spend in Japan
The Persona 4 (Junes?) music in the 7/11 really sold to me how big that place is over there.
Glad to see Sanji Enjoying Japan
Literally brought me to tears. Can’t wait to be this happy one day
jesus that "am I happy" segment really resonated with me and the fact that I may be trying too hard with my own channel. it stresses me out more than it should for being just a side hobby and I wake up every morning wondering if I will edit a video that day or not. the problem is, i don't feel like i should take a break until i reach 5k again, because if i just straight up leave now then when i come back i'll have even LESS subs which means i'll have to put in even MORE work and then it just becomes a vicious cycle. this youtube thing might not be for me but we'll see.
Jacob, you could have sent the stuff via mail and saved at least on buying the damn suitcases XD
Pokemon just spent their money and made it right back HAHAHA
SCOTLAND IN A TIER LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Congratulations Alpharad on finding your happiness, I hope I find mine soon.
Too bad Scarlet/Violet are still broken asf 😂
I don't think I'm quite to a position in life where I can know what makes me happy and what sates my ego, but this video will always stick with me for that.  I'm glad you've found some kind of happiness in the fickle life of subjective suffering. 15:29 Ohara got me into One Piece again after suffering the spee D. reader disease for years I was so happy to see him in this video.
Dang it Zoro is lost
This video made me cry and then beat me while I was down, I've been watching alpharad videos for years and I genuinely wish to be half the person Jacob is. He makes me want to be a better person in the best way, watching this video felt so personal and towards the end I was sobbing. To everyone reading this I love you all, this community has achieved such wonderful things and it's all because of what a kind and genuine person Jacob is.  <3
The pokemon company didnt sponsor Jacob to get money through exposure of this video, they did it just to get money through all of his purchases at the pokemon centre.
Jaidens style and tats go hard 🔥
So glad to have witnessed this journey!!!
Man the more I watching this, this my dream even down to ending, the whole reason I want to do content and everything else
2:03 DUOLINGO IS SUKUNA⁉️
I WISH I could subscribe twice my man! Awesome video! Can't wait for more!!!
Burnout is real. I think its important someone like yourself to be open like this. Take care of yourself.
16:24 does anyone know what OST this is? I can't find what this could be BUT IM SO FAMILIAR WITH IT!
my family doesn’t even have the amount of money you spent in their bank account and you spent it all on Pokemon merch 💀   To be honest, I’d do that too.
11:14 ... enemies to lovers trope easter egg?
It fills me with so much joy to know and see that I'm not the only one who mercilessly bombard their friends with stuff when they go on trips ❤❤❤
wholesome
Props to the kid saying Sanji-san to you Alpha I bet people there buying One Piece manga mistaken you as a Sanji cosplayer.
this now has to be my favorite video on youtube ever and i genuinely mean that. everything in this video hits too close to home with me like the ending where you gave all of your friends gifts and especially the section where you talk about trying to be truly happy, nothing but respect for taking the time to talk about that. you truly are an amazing person and deserve to be where you are now to have experience this once in a life time trip! :D
You know, I really wonder if all these sponsors think they're getting their moneys worth to pay me to press L 4 times in the middle of the video.
Did he lip sync his own words?
The compilation of old alpharad moments like breaking the stand in opening the dms, science museum and how to play 101 made me shed a tear... i grew up with these videos and you've been a constant positive force in my life. I'm so glad things are looking up for you and that one of my childhood idols is still kicking as a great influence on the internet.
POWER MENTIONED!!!! YAYAYAYAYAUAYAYUYUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! In all seriousness though, I aspire to be like you, Mr. Rad. Someone who works their ass off, then gives all of the people that mean the most to them personalized, incredibly touching things that just show how much you love them. Watching this video inspired me to just start working harder. Of course, this means I will have to start actually caring for myself. Thank you.
GOD DAM IT I LIVE HERE I SHOULD HAVE CAMPED SHIBUYA😭
0:53 HE DID THE THING
11:14 what a beautiful image
19:34 birb
Dutch McDonalds being C tier is a crime
I think this is the most wholesome amazing video that I've seen all year. Especially the end reinforcing my belief of how amazing Jacob is.  Love you, Alpha-dude 🫡
BASED GUY FOR HAVING BEEN IN COSTA RICA
8:35 hi mom
First time i wanna watch an ad
16:24 HOLD THE FUCK UP; MY BOY PLAYED MY MAIN GAME????   alpha, I want to see a video of you trying it out again.
So epic at the end!  Then I subscribed!  Awesomeness!
Incredibly heartfelt video, you deserve every subscriber from the push over the years. Even remembering the FWOB boys and your humble beginnings, bedroom? if you insist.
Damn I wish we were friends Jacob
God I really need to go to Japan
The fact that I'll never be more than just a fan is honestly crushing.   Having a friend like Jacob is something I've always wanted:  just a generally friendly guy who will do anything to make his friends happy.   Jacob, if you ever read this, thanks so much for sticking with this;   you are a massive inspiration to me, and I hope to meet you one day!
I'm going to Japan for the first time next week so this was perfectly timed. I'm that much more excited now, but there's 1 key takeaway here:  Bring extra suitcases
This reminds me of my trip to Japan it was life changing and in that time I ended up buying all my friends gifts obviously nowhere near the same amount of expenses but it's a crazy feeling but it's a nice way to express appreciation by being on the other side of the world thinking of them and during a transformative experience it's great to see!
getting 50 shades of fucked up- An alpharad experience
Me 5 min in: 😮  10 min in: 😲 15: 🥹 20: 😭😭  I have never been happier to hear that someone is happy.
Man I was not ready for this video to hit me so close to home (in a good way), you have no idea how glad it makes me to see someone else w/ mental health struggles relax and truly be happy!! It's such a long road but it's so worth it in the end for all the little silly personal moments ;u;
If we Australians have the best McDonalds, then I'd hate to see how you Americans screw it up.
Jacob, you are an inspiration. As I'm currently going through my own rough times and character development arc, I'm trying to carry on, booking therapy sessions is hard but I'm doing my best to push on through. I hope that I too one day can gift my friends that have been with me through it all, mystery boxes full of items from their favourite franchises.  I wasn't expecting to get so emotional over a video at 2am, but genuinely, thank you.
Bro 11:14
Australian McDonalds being S tier really makes me fear for the quality of foreign Maccas
Great video man, glad to hear you can finally say you're happy. Really made my day.
I genuinely was shocked to my core to see my "fool for you" cover featured in this video (even just for a flash lol). Thank you so much for inspiring me the past 8 years of my life and introducing me to the 2 bands that would change my life forever. it means the world to know you've seen at least one of those covers. glad you're feeling more fulfilled in life. in my books, that's all that matters.
I was having a hard time with my anxiety. Over my own future, really needed this. In it's own way this video made happy. As did it give me an answer. Thank for the many videos you written and to everyone that brought you here to your most happiest.
Glad you enjoyed being in japan! I wish I could visit lol.
I couldn’t stop smiling all the way through, what you do is immeasurable, great video!
damn bro you got me crying on my bed rn 😭
This really makes me want to go to Japan... If only I had friends 😭
Haul please
We love you ❤
Sanjirad
brooo how am i almost crying in an alpharad video
im genuinely emotional at the end and im so happy jacob is genuinely happy. parasocial i know but he's a cool guy and im glad he's happy
What a beautiful emotional rollercoaster of a video
That was too wholesome. I'm sobbing
When he said shibuya “ya know the place that…” I thought he was gonna say “the place from jjk” lmao
I love the video, the vulnerability that you've showed, and the love and care for others at the end. I'm still new to the channel but I love seeing that people still do this for others. Much love <3
It's really wholesome watching how much you care for your friends, but also the story about the kid calling you Sanji was so cute
This has to be the most wholesome, emotional video I have ever watched. Its mental see everything. and 10 years for that trip... hell that's something. Whats also something is the money burned but...the story told is amazing can't wait to see whats next and as long as your having fun that's all that's needed :D
11:14 um uh er ah wasn’t expecting that
Im glad you are happy now C:
Oooo look at me and how much money i have oooo look how cool and rich and awesome i am oooooo  Y'all smell that? It smells like broke in here
Its good that you are happy and that you are enjoying your life. Keep up the good work and make sure to take care of yourself more.  Edit: My eyes. My eyes TT~TT that was so precious.
OSAKA??? LIKE AZUMANGA DAIOH???
Aww, this was a really nice and wholesome video, god bless you for making everyone so happy <3 god knows i'd have even less restraint with buying funny little things if I ever go to Japan :')
was that a single frame of jacob and pchallenges making out
Seeing everyone open their gifts was awesome but I’m even more glad that you’re doing better mentally and trying to be more mindful about what makes you happy. You deserve the world brother
I don’t think there has been an alpharad video that has made me smile this much. Thank you so much Jacob! This made my day
That Miku poster at 13:12 hots different
A small child just randomly calling him Sanji is the best thing I've ever seen
Alpharad kissing at 11:14 😮
Is this a tax write off?
Bro hasn't had the Mckroket from Mcdonalds if he ranked the netherlands in C
Wow so wholesome
That is so sweet the end. 😭
I literally couldn’t stop smiling the last third of the video of all of his friends opening their gifts It’s so sweet and their excitement is so contagious 🖤
Damn, the ending had me smiling the whole way through.  Which is kind of a rarity, actually.  Nice.
ok that mcdonalds tier list is heat. as someone who's ate at mcdonalds in both japan and the US. heat fr
I gotta make sure that when I go to Japan, i have a lot of money saved up, because goly... imma be broke
Not only amazing to hear you’re doing so well but also seeing your friends so happy was incredible, everyone here sounded so excited and happy
There's something very surreal about hearing 'Date Start!' over an official sponsor from Pokemon and I love that it exists
Jan and Jacob kissing for a frame or 2.  Shoulda seen that one coming.
Never have I been so glad to be caught up on One Piece (this is a high bar to clear)
does jan kiss well????
2:45 wut 💀💀💀
Can someone explain why the Hawaii joke is? I don’t know what’s wrong about it lol
Alpha trying to sneak in the fact that he made out with pokemon challenges at end of day four was unexpectedly really funny
fuckinnnnnn everything           about this is excellent, thanks for everything youve done for everyone (especially yourself), jacob
i can’t get past the voice over and video not syncing
I am genuinely happy to hear that you’re happy. You’ve always brought content that I enjoy and I’m glad that you’re having the same joy from the channel!
Seeing the "A standard how to play 101" logo brought me back
Wow sold out to Pokémon, great right well yes however sitting there and saying everyone can do the seven star raid is a lie only people with Nintendo online get them which sucks so not for everyone and the real mask has terrible reviews glitchy buggy and barely any content for a billion dollar company and saying it’s great? I think the sponsor money he got must have made him overlook alllll the bad things in the real mask. But hay it’s Pokémon think it how you want right or wrong.
wow, honestly I kinda forget how long ive been watching you, ever since 2016 I think, its insane to see how far you have come man, the ending was such a cool thing to see, you are great dude.❤
The Persona 5 experience.
I feel that it's easy to forget that alpharad only has 3 mil. like, he's out hear doing 10 mil stuff
You do look like Sanji XDDDD
Love to see it man
The goat
Sweetest and most wholesome ending to a video 😊 And so glad you’re happy Jacob, that’s amazing 😊
Don't we all spend too much while travelling?
shoutout to pokemon for supporting alpharad to even do this it's so cool
15:03 Wolfey!!
Is alpharad gay ?!? 😅
I'm Australian, and I'm happy that we made it to the top of our tier list. Just gotta say, our mcdoubles are pretty good 😎
not liking and subscribing to this video is extremely not based
i did not expect to cry over the silly japan vlog but here i am wtf is wrong with you jacob alpharad
Jacob, brother, this is actually so selfless, and one of the greatest YouTube videos i have ever watched. you inspire me every single day with your work ethic, energy, and compassion. thank you for being so amazing, and thank you for inspiring the masses to be better people and selfless givers.
blud really is sanji
21:57 "because i get to be a furry" line made me break the hardest a line has ever broken me
holy fuck what a good video. so wholesome
my god i hope aplha showcases his house one day. geeez i wana see it
alpha we get it.... you are asking for more sponsers by talkin bout spendin money
This is a _strong_ contender for most wholesome video I've ever watched, and I've watched YT videos since 2007. You really brought a smile to my face throughout. Thank you.
I did not expect this video to make me cry but here we are. So immensely happy and proud of you man.
Who is he kissing at 11:14?
I want that jacket!
Alpharad the Alphachad Truly a radical man  Keep being a cool dude! Hope ya the best man :)
i don’t know how much it may mean to you hearing this from a stranger on the internet, but i’m proud of you! thank you for sharing your struggle, and being a kind human being. i’m glad you had a great time in japan!
Jacob saying he's happy followed by his friends opening up his gifts actually made me teared up, what an incredible video. I've been a subscriber for a few years now, and seeing how much you've grown as a person is so inspiring, we're so proud of you dude. 💙🌙
That little kid must have actually had a heart attack thinking he met the real Sanji
RIP Alpharad’s accountant, they’re no longer with us
This is Jacob’s crowning jewel. This is an amazing video, it’s nice to see Jacob’s true colours shine through with this, and the ending is so wholesome, I’m gonna cry. Best Alpharad video I’ve seen.
YO WHO IS HE KISSING
Congratulations on being higher on trending than BlackPink!
Damnit Jacob, you're my funny Internet guy that makes me laugh when I feel down. But here you are making me almost cry and making me feel incredibly grateful for the life I live. You're a huge inspiration and a fantastic person, I can't wait to see what comes next!
Ngl  ive gotten so used to blonde alpharad seeing him from 10 years ago brought both nostalgia and confusion
12 minutes in. This man better have bought another suitcase.
Waaaa most wholesome montage ever
Zoro got lost in the thumbnail 💀
Holy crap I'm glad you're happy man, walking through my adult life with you as a fun little guy to always be there for the funnies and occasionally the feels. I genuinely love the content you create. Keep flying on those super waxen wings and we shall keep clicking thumbs.
11:14 ayo
glad u see the light of aussie maccas
the kiss at 11:14 felt real. like, there was cheek movement. ty for this
Love that one part where alpharad and Jo kissed
13:35 YOASOBI MIKU SONG HECK YEAK HECK YEAH
So your telling me I was in Japan at the same time as you
So happy to hear him say that he’s happy ❤️
hi jo:)
I'm never gonna let you live the Sanji thing down. EVER. LOL
That ending actually made me tear up a little.
why is every youtuber going to japan the year I leave...
See, what’s fun about this is now all of these purchases are business expenses technically
NO WAY POKEMON COMMENTED ON A VIDEO WHERE EMULATION WAS CLEARLY SEEN
Watching this made me realize how unhappy I am and how much I hate my life.   Congrats on your success. You worked so hard for it and you deserve every moment of happiness you get. o7
16:26 CASTLE CRASHERS!?
As someone who has been watching alpharad for practically half my life, I think it’s amazing how much the man has grown from a small YouTuber to a well known funny man. Congrats on the awesome trip alpha
What an awesome gesture for an awesome trip, banger video Jacob! Glad to hear you're feeling better!
That…. That really hit me. The ending was beautiful your  story great. It really resonated with stuff I’ve been going through recently and the end of this video was kinda Inspiring. Very cool alpha very cool
This was a great video to watch - great pacing, great jokes, great gifts! Glad to hear you had a lovely, well deserved vacation! I hope you're enjoying more of life, your friends, and really enjoying your happiness.  So like - those 3 frames? We're not going to talk about it? Oh. Ok. No worries.
The smile I have at the end seeing all your friends get stuff. I wish I could be part of your community. I'm so depressed in my own life. I need this.  😫
11:12-11:14, watch at 0.25 speed.
The ending was so powerful. Not just the gift giving but the whole 'am I happy' moment brought me to tears and reminded me to go find joy. Thank you.
The pipeline from me being a huge One Piece fan since 2016 hearing Jacob say he’d never get into One Piece on Alpharad Plus into Jome (I think) proceeding to get the entire friend group vehemently into One Piece is I think the most serotonin-inducing YouTube arc I’ve ever witnessed first hand.
I think you should move there. Like most the youtubers do these days !
For everyone coming from the flappy bird Gold video... 11:14 0.25x speed
Jacob dude you're a absolute beauty... without a doubt! so freakin' wholesome!
This vid is so wholesome, seeing everyone so happy warms my heart 🤍 the merch maybe a cry for help but great tax write offs & amazing content
That karaoke kiss !!
This is my favorite Alpharad video of all time
I only watch Alpharad Gold, so I just had to tune in when I heard about the 3 frames.
MONSTER HUNTER STORE GRAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I NEED
HE MADE OUT WI THEY KI WHAT
I feel your pain at the over spending. I would have totally done the same thing.
Its so surreal seeing pokemon as a sponser, never seen this in my life
Ah yes. The embarrassment of the first Tokyo Pokémon store visit when you load up a shopping bag and turn to realize that you’re an adult in a store intended for Japanese children.  The persona 5 music is based btw
My poor ass watching this happy for alpharad
Comment for the algorithm
Doing interaction so jacob can make his money back
1:31 WAIT YOU WENT TO NORWAY?
LETS GO JACOB AAAAAAAAAA
Bro makes like a mil a year and makes an entire video about spending a couple thousand dollars lol.
I'm not joking when I say that I started crying at the end with all the gift reveals. To be able to spoil your friends such affectionate and personal gifts is genuinely a dream of mine, and I am so happy for you that you could do it. I don't have 20k$ to spend on a trip to Japan, but fuck me if I ever go I'm doing some version of this.
This has gotta be the best video on the channel yet. It perfectly paints the picture of both what Tokyo means to us, and what the channel means us. It cries out passion and heart.
feels weird not seeing smant here
Zoro getting lost in the thumbnail is GOLD
i can never unsee alpharad as an unintentional sanji cosplayer
Dude i just hope you will make 10 times more money than you already did :) spend-it with you and your friends because thats the best way to do-it :)
can anyone tell me where to buy the Shanks Jacket at 2:58?
ive been studying japanese for the past couple of months and now i really want to go there 😭
11:14 if you pause just right…you’ll see something 🫢
Genuinely my favorite Alpharad video This felt like the culmination of every video, experience, and journey Ive seen on this channel  The ending is absolutely beautiful as well, as well as that mental health speech
I learned beforehand that reading Katakana is much more useful than hiragana because being able to read loanwords usually means you know what it says. Reading hiragana only lets you know how to say the word in Japanese and that puts it at about the same level as French or German to the average American.
And so begins Alpha’s descent into Kleptomania
I loved seeing all the pokemon stuff but I would love hear about your experience as a one piece fan. I've been watching ohara (Manu) for as long as I've been watching you so it was a pleasant surprise to see him in your video. So happy your had a great time and youre loving life.  Thanks for all the great videos!
Am I the only one who saw Jan kiss alpha excuse me??
11:14 Masisi
11:14 Ayooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Very wholesome
Americans
11:14 is wild
Alpha, it makes me really happy to hear that you're happy, giving back to people you love, and taking care of yourself over your content.  I apologize if I'm being too presumptuous, but I do sometimes think about how the past few years can't have been easy for you with grieving your divorce and struggles with other crap I probably have no idea about. As someone still stumbling my way through grief and struggling to believe that I can really love life again, it's really encouraging to hear you say that you're truly happy.   I'm hoping to visit Japan one day, but note taken to bring at least one extra suitcase. 😆
I already wanted to go to japan more than anything, you don’t gotta taunt me like this bro 😤🫨
As much as you make silly videos, you inspire everyone in your community and people around u to strive to do better!
This was an amazing video, like, one of the best from Alpharad to date. Loved it.
50 shades of F@#$% up ... kisss Arra Arra :P
No one is gonna say anything about Jan and Jacob making out?  Ok, I’ll do it..: 11:14
i wonder what he got pointcrow
Why did  it make me so profoundly happy to hear him talk about how genuinely happy he is with his life right now after looking it up and finding out he‘s the same age as me? Well, whatever the reason is, I wish him he‘ll keep being this happy with his life in the future <3
HE WENT TO SHIBUYAH THE PLACE WHERE PERSONA 5 TAKES PLACR?!
I'm Japanese! I'm really glad that u enjoyed Japan a lot. u r more talented for telling how wonderful Japan is than Japanese 😂. ありがとう！また来てね！
In rhe future, try vacuum sealable bags! They're so good at compressing merchandise, especially plushies and clothing
11:14, pause
11:14.  You're welcome.
The fact that you brought back gifts(not 1 but a BOAT LOAD) for like 20 people is CRAZYYY
I can't believed I cried watching one of your videos, the ending was one of the most heartwarming moment I've ever seen on YouTube, thank you so much for all the content you provide !
I’m glad you are happy with we’re you are now and that you were able to give back to your friends.
This sounds like such a dream vacation to me. The fact that you also got to experience some of rural Japan is somethign I want so badly, and also getting to just experience how wild the main cities are as well.  Genuinely not sure I could experience enough in one trip.  Edit: ok I only saw the furst two days this is going downhill fast money wise 😂
Alpharad with a truly beautiful video. I went from laughing my ass off to damn near in tears in 27 minutes. I'm so glad to hear that you're happy Alpha!
Happy to see my fav content creator be so pumped up to talk about their trip. It was so heartwarming i couldn't process it Also that one frame at 11:14 was REALLY surprising
That ending when you gave stuff to your friends genuinely made me cry. That is the sweetest thing I have ever seen 😢
goddamn it jacob you know too well how to play my empathy
I am so poor
This is awesome
When I heard Pokémon themselves sponsored this video, my jaw dropped. Absolutely insane.
Love your yellow Hare. And your hair is cool too.
Am i the only one that noticed that the unite tournament shown at 11:24 were not worlds.
Honestly I’m not sure what it was (probably everything), but I really felt this video on an emotional level. Listen Alpha, we care about you as a person. Just because you don’t know us doesn’t mean we have to be strangers, and I want you to know that at least I will always be so happy to watch any video you put out, and will gladly wait for however long you need if it means you can take better care of yourself.  Sincerely, a caring stranger <3
Seeing myself in alpharad is pretty neat, hardly get to see myself in others haha
happy you happy bro go drink some water =) ♥
This is honestly such a sweet and heartfelt video, so proud of Jacob’s journey as a creator and person and so happy that he’s happy 😭
Watching the end felt like a pacifist ending in undertale
Gosh I wish I could like videos more than once
AY YO THE 1 FRAME GAY KISS???
As an Australian, the fact that Australia is #1 in fast foods per country tier list makes me dread the concept of trying fast food in other countries.
This man should not be allowed to have a credit card
Does alpha lip-sync his in person recording? It feels lip-synced lol
I am once again reminded why internet funny man Alpharad is still one of my favorite people to watch on this goofy website
Man I relate to Alpharad so much, I always buy lots of stuff for my girlfriend, friends and family wherever I am  Amazing video❤
Should’ve just been in a cdawgVA for the claw machines. You know free technically.
HI JO
@11:24 Alpharad's the fucking GOAT dude holy shit
Being friends with alpharad is better than being friends with MrBeast
i want it ALL!
Okay, that ending was so aggressively wholesome that I almost cried.
11:14
I ship it 11:14
Wow this vid actually made me cry. I just had to make a tough decision today, I feel like im letting people down and I feel so quilty. I had to quit something cause of my health. A part in this vid just spoke to me?? That taking a break is fine and that you need to prioritize your wellbeing. I feel a little bit better about it now. Thank you.
So no one is gonna talk about Alpharad and Pokemon Challenges at 11:14 ?
Alpharad, I like to throw on YT videos in the background and do other things but there is something about your videos that has me get engrossed in them like I’m watching a good movie.
of everything i was expecting from this video, seeing Jaiden wear the same miku hoodie that i've had for a couple years was Not one of them and Very Distracting
As somebody who lives in Japan it’s always weird but cool seeing these videos of YouTubers because there’s shots like 3:00-3:04 I walk on that exact street every day and I was in that don quijote earlier today even
this is so wholesome to watch, someone whos been here since 2015 seeing this just makes me feel happy even though im at the lowest possible point in my life, i hope to be like Jacob one day be able to make myself and other people around me happy. This was so awesome to watch
11:14 a frame for the ages for sure.
I’m way to blitzed for this right now Jacob😅😅
I’ve been a fan since How to Greninja 101, and I like seeing my fav content creator enjoying life. Thank you for the years of incredible content and I’m glad you enjoyed your trip.
holy shit this video actually made me tear up, that was awesome
Just went to Japan for my dads 50ith birthday. It was so fun, I luckily avoided spending outrageous amount of money but yeah it’s expensive there
Goddamn dud nearly teared up at the 'I'm happy' bit, wish u the best!
Just hearing the name Shibuya gave me some ptsd lol
Petition for an Alpharad house tour after this
i would too
8:14 SHIBUYA??? LIKE THE INCIDENT OF SHIBUYA?!?!
Jacob, I don''t know if you'll see this comment, but I am writing this through tears. I cried halfway through your video - if anyone deserves this trip, it's you. And I am crying cause I also relate a lot. I'm also working hard right now, and I just have a mix of emotions watching your video. I'm happy watching it because Pokemon saved me a lot as a kid, and so did anime. At times, it felt like they were my only friends there for me during times of darkness and loneliness.  I'm hopeful because I hope one day I can achieve this same level of happiness you were able to on this trip. I just want you to know that if you touched the heart of just one viewer with this video - it's me. Please continue to create amazing content that you love to do and play with friends, because sometimes it feels like I'm right there with you guys <3
you have to do sanji cosplay now sorry i dont make the rules
11:14 I thought I saw this for a split second 😭
It's always so cool to see people enjoy their gifts, even if you had nothing to do with it, great video alpharad, love all your content.
wait no one noticed Jacob and Jan making out at 11:14 ??
A WILD KARAOKE JAN APPEARED
Man I've been a fan since almost the beginning of the channel and did not expect to come out crying. You are truly inspiring and you motivate me to go further. Thank you Alpha❤
Can’t believe you went to place; Japan and didn’t bring dakotah
Watching the end where you sent your friends all the gifts genuinely made me smile because it’s so nice to see how caring you really are behind the “fuck it we ball” attitude and that’s why you’ve remained my favorite YouTuber for  so lobg
I had a great time, thank you for this video. You are an amazing person. I'm honestly so happy seeing you enjoy yourself!=) The last five minutes of the video were so wholesome=3
I hate that you're so good at hitting emotional beats with your storytelling, fuck 😭
Shut up, your rich
Alpha! Jacob! Hey, I’ve subscribed to you somewhat recently and just want to say your vibes have been nothing but awesome. This video in general and especially where you went into trying to make sure you were happy made my day. Just want to say even if I don’t know you personally you seem like a genuine good person and mean well and you are appreciated.   I’ve been truthfully struggling through life a lot lately and watching your videos and how you are is a positive vibe that has been helping. Just wanted to say thanks man and hope life keeps going well for ya! 🙏❤️💯
someone started cutting onions ffs, that was so wholesome!
Relatable Japan experience! 🇯🇵💸 For fellow travelers, how do you balance indulgence with budgeting in culturally rich destinations? Intrigued by varied strategies! ✈
I could cry that was so sweet. Don't we all wanna send our friends giant boxes of nerd stuff they love? Living the dream there. Look after yourself too sir!
4:06 “Phenomenal Expansion” ????  Wtf 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 More like a trash ass DLC for a trash ass game
... What did he gave to Erick?  Damn i want to know.
Guys don’t look in the thumbnail, it’s has spoilers!!!
Beautiful video Japan is a magic place
2:03 I honestly needed to rewind to confirm the thought of “was that a sukuna duolingo bird?”
I've been loving your content this whole time and its been super fun to watch your channel grow and evolve over the years. I'm glad you finally took some time for yourself!
Alpharad is truly the Santa Claus of YouTube
Don’t let alpha’s generosity distract you from the fact that he kissed Pokémon challenges
11:15 holy fuck what is that song
11:14 has 4 interesting frames 😂
holy shit i wanna go to japan so bad
I came into this video thinking I was just about to watch Alpharad spend absurd amounts of money on merch for shits and giggles but ended up crying happy tears seeing it was all for his friends 😭💙
this is pretty awesome
Alpha isn’t real, he’s made by the Japanese government to buy merch.
I love the little honest talk about your mental wellbeing. Thank you for sharing, and i am glad you had fun in Japan!
I need to see alpha in a sanji cosplay now. Who else wants this.
I love seeing Jacob so happy after watching his videos for so long
It is a dream of mine to be able to go to Japan and have as much fun as you did. Also it was so nice of you to give all that stuff to your friends, what a heartfelt ending!
That was such a sweet ending omg what a cool thing to do
POKEMON HIMSELF?????
11:14 😳
Jan defenitly felt the Karokebar
understandable i’d go into generational debt for all the stuff i saw
11:14 shout out to bi visibility
Only here for 11:14
so glad that im subscribed to sanji onepeice
Plusie deluxe gold members stare with superiority to the peasants that hadnt all the trip spoiled already.
lol jaiden animation is always somewhere in someone's video.
11:14 Wait, what?
Alternative title: recluse gamer discovers going outside can improve his quality of life
Alpha you are amazing I just hope you bought some stuff for you to you deserve
The fact he knew what to get his friends just shows he listens it's really cool to see the change over the past 10 years
Augh I've been watching for years, maybe it was around fwob time?(idk tbh) I wish to someday maybe in a year or two to collaborate
Watching a guy go to Japan and spend tons of money while it's hard to pay for anything in America is neat. Definitely cool and not out of touch.
Proud to see Sweden McDonald's at the top tier
We add a video with just all the stuff you bought
I haven’t played Pokémon in a bit, maybe I’ll fold
Cool felx.
11:14 yooooo what is alpha up too
Alpha has officially become a bugman.
Less than halfway through the video and alpha has spent more money than I have in my bank account
The ending is fucking heatwarming
Glad jaiden got to enjoy it with you 😁  And you should definitely take some off days to recover your mental health
What's next you ask? keep doing it,  good deed will never die my fellow hooman, till one day when you're on the death bed, the room is filled with GENUINE people who will trying to figure out on how to not unlive you at the moment.
Alpha you are absolutely amazing! I love all your content and everything you do on this channel. Your so thoughtful, kind and inspiring. Please keep up the amazing content it makes me so happy watching your videos. :)
Did you fr kiss a man again realy is the slopiest drunk
The last bit of this video with everyone opening their gifts absolutely made my day! Alpharad is one of the best YouTubers and I will die on this hill
Man, what tha fuck Alpharad, I just wanted to laugh about funny Pokémon Japan things and now I'm crying akd miss everyone I have ever liked.
Alpha is peak chaotic bisexual energy and I am here for it lol
R O T O M V A C U U M C L E A N E R
so happy for you genuinely
So Alpharad is sanji note taken
Jacob and Jan, starcrossed lovers for karaoke
9:54 had me wheezing
Was that Jan!? How fucked up did he get? Enemies to lovers question mark. /s
11:14 From enemies to ...
I wasn't expecting to cry from a place Japan video, but here I am. Thank you Alphard for all the great content.
*points at camera* YOU (cuts to a clip of Jawsh)
I have never smiled so much at an ending in my life. Your words are so inspiring and thank you so much for sharing on this platform! You made my day...
We not gonna talk about that karaoke smooch? 😂😂
I've taken away sm from this video. One mental health tips and two THERES MORE PIKMIN MERCH IN THE WORLD. THANK YOU NINTENDOOOOO!!!
I'm so glad that Mexico is on the A tier of Alpha's tier list xD
He should do an unboxing video of all the things he got from Japan
11:14 haha
I'm happy that you're happy. 💚  I discovered you through Smant but I've grown to love you. I love you as a person and as an entertainer. You're amazing when you're happy.   Your joy makes me happy. Your own joy is crucial. I'm only as happy as you are. You deserve to be happy and I want all the good things to happen to you. 💚  You are at your most entertaining when you're just actually happy. I wouldn't watch you if you weren't. I don't want you to suffer through content and pretend to be happy, I actually just want you to be happy and share it.   Live your best life. Share it with us. It's great. Have all the most genuine fun and share it. aber your happiest self. <3
JACOB IS SANJI
see this is exactly what i'd be doing if i had massive amounts of spending money, id buy my friends EVERYTHING
I’m glad you enjoyed your trip to Japan. I can’t wait to go there myself
This is an amazing video. I love that you went to the Japan and vloged it. You should always do things that make you happy.
You're a really nice guy, alpha, if I ever make it big in life like you, I'll definitely follow your path
Cant wait to see the rest of your crew in the next video! Keep it up!
You got a big heart Jacob
I'm so happy for you alpha, I started watching you a couple of years ago and you've been consistently my favourite since then!!! love the content, I'm so glad you had this experience ♥️
This video made my birthday. Thank u so much for giving everyone gifts it melted my heart 😢❤
Jacob playing himself off as being an unhealthy spender throughout the whole video and then giving everything to his friends is so wholesome 🥺
I saw that frame of you making out with Jann, you can't hide the truth! :D
hit me in the feels
Ngl your sob story is an annoying part of the video as you have it better than like 90% of the world lmao
fuck man i almost cried watching all your friends so excited over what they got, that's so wholesome and amazing
This video warmed my heart deeply 🤍
So wholesome 😭
Congratulations Jacob! Thanks for all those years of commitment and for the laughs! Honestly I am so happy you have some great friends to help you! Thank you❤
that heckin' worlds checkout bill was..... stroke inducing
They say money can't buy happiness, but it clearly can. It can even buy other people happiness in this case.
You gifting all your friends personalized gift boxes made me so emotional. I think it reminds me too much of how my own friends are the reason why I am where I am today. Thank you Jacob for sharing this with us!
This is so heartfelt.
11:14 no comment
AWWWW OH MY GOD THE ENDING IS MAKING MY HEART BEAT SO HARD DUDE YOURE SUCH AN AWESOME FRIEND. i wanna be able to do the things you do within both content and friendship and theres a reason i love you (as a youtuber nothing parasocial just autistic attachment) as much as i do jacob <3
You AND JAN?!
Okay but Does anyone see that kiss with Jan????????
The ending almost had me crying by how much you cared for your friends and even remembered small things they liked. Good video 🥰
17:03   God damn it why have i seen 3 mid life crisises you, haminations and somethingelseyt
why was hawaii ill timed
He's such a kind soul,  love him :(
Alpharad being recognized as Sanji is hilarious xD
11:14 so Jan finally got his wish.
11:14 😳
Make a unboxing video
i envy the fact that you can buy those things
Sounds awful...
Honestly my favorite video you made
Bro i would do the same thing
I know that no one is going to read this because people are going through their own struggles but I don't care. There is so much going through my mind. This just makes me hate my life more and more. I don't have friends that want to help me or even talk to me. They always act like I am not there even though we have been friends for nearly a Decade. I know that talking about your feelings on the internet is stupid but I don't care. Especially when I want to be a youtuber in the future, but this shit just makes me die. My friends would NEVER do anything like this for me and I would in a heartbeat. I have been struggling all my life and I just wanted to have a crew that always had my back, but instead my family gets robbed and screwed over by the government. We have to move out of our house which we lived in for 12 years because of an asshole that ruined my mothers mental state. Everything is falling apart and I know that no one will read this shit but this makes me feel slightly better. I have only one chance to help my family and that is by doing youtube. I don't want to get hyper focused on youtube like you did Alpha but I have no other options. This has been my dream since I was a child and every day something happens that pushes me farther away from my goals. I always put others feelings above my own and do things that others normally won't. I am a fucking custodian after all, I clean shit that most would steer clear of for a couple bucks a day. I have no clue how to end this so I will just say, Thank you Alpha for all you do and did that taught me how to be a better youtuber. I use tons of strategies and Tactics that you use in your own videos. I am currently learning how to edit videos and I have the work ethic. There are just a few things that I need that are completely out of my reach. At the end of the day it is all about luck and if you have the skill to grab onto that luck and run with it.
Jacob really snuck in that quick clip at 11:14 and I have so much respect for him for that.  On the real though I've been following since earlier days on YT and it's amazing to hear that you're finally in a happier mental place bc you truly deserve it after the amount of joy you've brought into your viewers lives! Much love man keep up the good work!
YOU CANT PUT NORWAY ON C TIER💔💔
So your mainly explaining why we (America) is in so much debt to Japan💀 your not the only one
i dont even know this channel, and i am not even subscibed, this was my first video and im sitting here crying over how good person you are, and im going to sub
Scottish McDonalds A Tier? I'll take it
I got a pic with my sister next to the long people at 9:57
Jacob’s accountant on life alert now
w xenoblade music
This is me if i ever went to Japan but instead of Pokemon stuff ( I might ), I would spend it on my main hobby.. Transformers. Takara makes some pretty good MP Transformers that normally 300+ bucks in the American market... and then finding my 2nd hobby.. Beyblade. Japan has a Beyblade Training Center
You know I honestly want to rewatch this video again and again
The outdo music gave me chills
Shoutout to Zoro getting lost in the thumbnail, he’s walking around somewhere till someone brings him back to the Sunny.
I'm a simple girl, I see Pikmin in the preview, I click.
dude im so happy that you’re doing better mentally now, take care of yourself man
are we not gonna talk about him getting sloppy on Day 4
I can’t unsee Sanji now.😂 10:45
I am seething with jealousy. This is like my number one on my bucket list but ima broke boi
If you ever need someone to help I’m here to help! Love you alpharad
man i just fucking love this dude
That pokemon challenges kiss was a surprise, but also not. It's amazing to see everyone so happy about their gifts
That part where Jacob shares his struggles and that he got slowly out ot it was already giving me a smile, but the part after ? Gosh man, my heart wasn't ready for such hapiness shown
By pure happenstance, I went to Japan around the same time you did and honestly seeing you enjoy it as much as I did and experience some similar things made me happy beyond reason and took me back to my time there. And then to end it all by giving all those memories and merch items to your friends was the cherry on top. Glad you enjoyed yourself!  Edit: Can confirm that 7-11 in Japan is a gift from the heavens.
This was such a nice, wholesome video. I’m glad you’re happy! I totally understand that whole conversation.
alpha, im genuenly happy that you are doing good. some people really de-humanise youtubers to the point that it makes me sad, even though it doesnt effect me personally. i know you prob wont see this cause like around 5k people said what they think of this vid, but if you do just know that as long as you are doing great. it doesnt matter what vids you post, i wil watch them all
one of the goats
Anyone else noticed the kiss?
Traveling really does change your perspective on life. Very good video.
I loved this video 😊
So am I not the only one who cried watching this
Turns out Alpha can’t fight women
9:53, is that Alexander The Warrior Jar?!
Alpharad needs the rest he deserved hes big long year Break
Thank you🙏❤️✨️
So what I got from this video is that Japan is just fortnite?
at 11:14 Jacob saying good night to the homies
very cool Alpharad. 🙂
OooOooo you like kissing boyyyys
This is the real Shibuya incident
I SAW THAT KISS WITH JAN WHAT WAS THAT
This video feels so surreal because I just came back from Japan right before you went and I recognized a ton of locations and landmarks
Heya Alpha. I gotta meet you in Japan and I just wanna say thank you!
I had a similar moment of introspection after a two week trip I took to Taiwan earlier this year. It's amazing what you realize about yourself and your life when you take more than a week away from your grind and routine to focus on just enjoying yourself. Glad you've found your happiness.
We need to see Jacob cosplay Sanji now.
This video had me smiling throughout, I'm so glad you had such a good experience and that you're able to talk about how happy you are!! Anyone who has you as a friend is absolutely blessed, remembering everything your friends enjoy is such a beautiful quality to have
I'm only half way through the video why does he already have two more empty suitcases now oh god   Update: I got to the last 5 minutes now I wanna cry tears of joy
I feel you.  I live in Japan and have dyed bright red hair.  I'm constantly compared to Shanks lol.
Alpha you put soo much editing and effort in to these videos and your soo fucking AMAZING. After watching this video I was speechless thank you for putting all the time and effort into this video and shoutout to @pokemon y’all are awesome, this is my new fav alpha vid
I seriously did not expect that ending 😢❤
This might be my new favourite Alpharad Video
Why is Scotland McDonald’s an A the only difference is irn bru
Great video. Honestly one of my biggest inspirations in my life has been all the videos you’ve made and watching you talk about how you’ve evolved mentally over time. Your videos really make me feel like I can do what I set my mind on too. Truly I love your content and I appreciate all you’ve gone through for these videos
Seeing how happinesscmuch One Piece has brought you has been great
I found your channel from Jaiden and fail. just want yo say you are a great person and creator.
Baby in Car and Kid in Car for Dash and Colin was so perfect.
I thought you where about to quit :(
I wonder what pointcrow got? But I'm happy that ur doing great!
I wonder what pointcrow got? But I'm happy that ur doing great!
Wait how tall is actually Jan?
I love you content Alpha and don't think that this is your fault. But this video is the perfect essay on "Why we will never have a good Pokemon game again". They main Pokemon games are only to show the next 50-100 Pokemon so we can spend thousands of dollars in merch.
i'm not crying at the unboxings you are
I have been watching this channel long enough to remember the passing 100k story for glory, the anxiety felt of no longer having a community due to being too big.  I am happy to see Jacob happy and to have his own community again
11:14 ????
This has to be the most cute and pleasant video on this channel! I'm so happy for you all!
That's a dream coming true for you Jacob, and you deserve it! This was really nice of Pokemon to have you go there. ^^
Japan truly cures souls
1. Glad you're figuring out the work/life balance that you need. It's super important to living healthily. 2. Even if you had help putting some of the packages together (in terms of content), it shows how well you know your friends and how much you care about them from the reactions at the end. Very hearting.
Bro just randomly started trauma dumping
BABY in car (chopper image)
God this video made me smile from the beginning until the end (most especially the end). It’s so sweet how curated the boxes were despite being it “random”. Alpha is the sweetest and most genuine youtuber ever. I love his channel before but I love and respect him more now.
i watched the first few minutes if the video but then had to go so something and accidentally left the video running the first words i hear when i come back are ‘sexy maid’
is the audio of his voice desynced very slightly, or is it just me?
You had me in tears of joy 😭 The End was one of the most wholesome things i have watched in years
Woah... I was just making a goofy joke for that ending question, but... that was legitimately wholesome!
The only thing i get from McDonald's in Canada is the double big mac
11:14 You are welcome
I'm glad you went to Japan and had fun, and to take a step back from YouTube to relax and find happiness is life
Thank you jacob for this, i you have caused so much joy for me in my 9 or so years of watching you, i truly wish that i can find myself working as hard as you are to love yourself and find a wonderful balance in life to help me chase my future and my dreams. I did get out of bed this morning because of this video, so thank you for that too
PogU
I'm so happy that you had a great time with your friends!
As a relative nobody, it's honestly real nice to see that getting your wish like this lead to you fully realizing a lesson that so many of us still need to learn and take to heart!  Rest well, and give yourself a break sometimes when you feel you need it.
Wholesome: 100

Cant believe sanji created a youtube channel as a side job
SHIBUYA?? YOU MEAN THE PLACE GOJO GOT ABOLUTELY SHIT ON???
You have so much love to give. I’m so happy I got to see some of that today.
11:14 Caught in 4k hyper definition Pokémon lens 360.9-e hyperdrive Hatsune no Miku
alpharad and jan making out was not on my 2023 bingo card
Can't unsee Sanji, you've gotta get the curly brows even if just by make-up
ahh nice, finally someone that can answer my question ya, is Jan a good kisser? I mean look at him, he has to right?
He must've gotten pointcrow some stuff from the 7-11...
Mr. THE Jacob Alpharad, you’re an inspiration to me. Made me nearly cry at least 10 times during this video. You’re probably the most unpredictably amazing person I’ve had the opportunity to watch grow and succeed.
I’m glad you had a wonderful time, and I’m glad you’re feeling good. We love you Alpha 💕
Can anyone explain the ill timed hawaii thing? I feel like I'm missing context here
I need the duolingo sukuna plushie
1:31 i beg you to try switzerland micky d‘s (uhm if ur down for a photo, uhm, the one at Pratteln, Basel-Landschaft, dont give me a heartattack tho, go to idfk zurich or geneva)
You're lucky that a little kid confused you for Sanji. If I went to Japan, I'd probably be confused for Krillin because I'm so bald.
im glad that youre happy jacob, youre probably my favorite youtuber, and seeing that you are doing good and in a better mental state puts me at ease if that makes any sense. we all love you.
glad your enjoying life alpha and thanks for putting time into YouTube
I'm really glad you included your growth in your script cuz that was somthing I needed to hear last night. Keep taking care of yourself❤❤
12:34 I never expected an Azumanga reference in a Alpharad video.
From one Oklahomie to another I’m glad you’re happy
This video is so fucking awesome man, i would love to do shit like this later on in my life and I hope to get there someday, but for now I'm just gonna be happy their great people out their like you :)
Thank you Alpharad. I now know I need a lot more money than 15k when visiting Japan and three massive suitcases
alpharad out here living his best life and i'm all for it, mans looks like hes having a blast edit: omg watching how happy alpha's friends are at his gifts after hearing alpha talk about how much they meant to him is one of the most wholesome things
the add on you did about giving stuff to your friends was a nice touch dude. good call back to some great episodes
Bro, the kid just said you look like Sanji from One Piece. I say just take the compliment, bro.
this is actually the sweetest fucking thing
oh course jadin got a giant joltick
So, jaiden gets free plus he’s And you get a plane ride and multiple debts?
This is a man who is thriving ❤
11:14
I can only imagine his hotel room slowly getting filled up with merch…
We just gotta ignore the fact that Jacob and Jan finally made out??...... yeah??... okay :)
AT EXACTLY 11:14 there is a FRAME of Jacob and somebody else kissing! I REPEAT THERE IS A FRAME OF JACOB AND SOMEBODY ELSE KISSING!!!
there's probably a room full of plushies in alpharad's house
If I become a multi billionaire I will lose all my money in japan
My wallet cried looking at this
🇸🇪 . So when will we get to see the Crane Game Challenge video?
I have been here since one of your earliest Sm4sh videos and all I can say is enjoy what you have created, you earned all of this and I’m glad to say I been here along for the ride.
The one piece stuff goes buck
15:30 Ohara was there
Thank you for the wholesome video and enjoying life as you experienced Japan. I cried tears of happiness and got emotional toward the end as I watched the other friends' reaction.
As someone native to Costa Rica  I can def say McDonald's here is B tier
11:14 your welcome
Ayo this man fits a crest of flames tattoo that’s so cool
A wise man once said, if it keeps you from killing yourself, it's an essential item
Aww I get it that it might felt pretty awkward but the kid was kinda cute for assuming you look like sanji just because you have light hair. I love this video, it went in an unexpected direction and I needed to cry. Glad to have you Alphared.
Videos like this is the reason I never stopped watching Alpharad
YO ITS SANJI 🚬
so the real japan was... the friends we made along the way?
I will be your friend Alpha!   Also unrelated I love Pokémon and Super Sentai merch
oh damn man was not kidding. pokèmon does love this man
gosh dang that how you be an influence. i wish i could do something like that for friends and family. and can only hope to see this trips impact on you through out your content and collabs
Subscribe to get his money back  Lol
I pray to see alpha in trash taste after seeing him hanging with Conner
Honestly the most hype moment in this video is seeing Jacob's McDonalds tier list with Australia in first.  As an Aussie, he's 100% right. I've literally never been able to eat Maccas outside of my country bc it always tastes like shit. Thank you Jacob for recognising the perfection of the Aussie Big Mac.
I really appreciate Scotland being separated from Britain in the tier list. <3
that's probably the least profitable sponsored video ever
11:13 Jacob ?🤨🤨
Oh if we had all the sitting cuties I could not control the urge to buy
I’m currently on my first ever trip to Japan and this video could not have come out at a better time! Love what you do alpharad!
heart warm,ing
AWAKENED LUCCI
Is jaden animashons your best frend? Please answer
10:43 I see the resemblance,
Get yourself a friend who knows you as well as Jacob knows his friends 🥰
Canada needs to be much higher on the McDonald’s tier list
I am at a bad mental Space right, thanks for showing that People that I respect a lot also can do irracional things too ❤
As someone who has also been and also had the time of his life there (and also hopes to one day somehow scrape together and save up enough money and time to go again) I felt the need to point out something about this vid. He genuinely undersold those 7-11 shops.
Seeing everyone happy at the end was the best.
I've returned for the kiss scene and it happens @ 11:14
This is so sweet, great video! Glad you had a great time!
When Rad said it was a cry for help I really felt that. We lived in Japan for 3 years and the first time I went to Pokémon center I 100% blacked out and spent $600
IS THAT YOUR ARCH NEMESIS JAN
Sanji-San
Bro I’m fucking cry😢😢😢
11:14 Pokémon Challenges and Alpharad getting friendly.
2:00 goddamnit alpharad why did you learn hiragana katakana is the one that they have english words in
Has somebody tallied up how much money in American dollars he spent?
the minute jacob said he sent all his friends gifts and owes them everything— i openly weeped
you're literally living my dream. pokémon worlds AND mm23..... damn!!! 🥰❤️
such a great video 👌
Jaiden looks damn badass tho 🔥
Dash’s laugh gives me life
Basically the Maxmoefoe Japan experience
8:47 what's a fiefhead?
if anyone ever told me that i would ever tear up during an alpharad video i would have called them crazy, but right now i am just so glad to be a small part of this huge community
You fell victim to the capitalist mindset of thinking your value and happiness came from work, money, and success. But we work so we can live not live so we can work brother
who is the vtuber at 22:47?
Honestly I’m so happy for you and the tremendous growth you have made not only to your channel but your personal life and mental well-being
Netherlands McDonald's being a C is 100% valid. I'm Dutch myself and it sucks. But sometimes you crave it XD.
Im happy you had a good time
9:37 WHATS THE LITTLE WHITE BEAR/HAMSTER GUY CALLED- i cant find them :(
Did anyone else see the half second clip of alpharad marking out with someone 😅
0:53 soy jacob
Did no one else notice Alpharad and Pchal kissing at 11:13 😨💀
1:31 I can confirm as a Australian we have amazing McDonald’s
I'm really glad that you're happy, Jacob. This was a lovely video and your friends being so excited was the cutest thing!
You've been to Norway?
I'm happy for you Alpharad!
The face at 13:27 is one of realizing how much money was spent
Local internet funny man DOES have emotions
This man is unhinged, and we need more like him
5:58 o luba e o leo ali
i hate you alpharad you almost made me cry
japan is fortnite
No one talking about Zoro getting lost in the thumbnail? Really?
To have this much passion, gratitude, to know so well this many people, his friends, by heart is just- wow. I think each and every one of Alpha’s friend truly is blessed to have such a good person in their life.
This video was perfection ❤🥺  Also I loved the shot of you making out with Jan lol
So we gonna ignore him kissing Pokémon challenges right
6:16 JAN SPOTTED
Damn, no-one told me this would be WHOLESOME
I’m glad that Alpha is great with his friends.      And great at kissing his lover at 11:14
the japan good ending
For trying mcdonalds in other countries if you end up in the middle east, get a mcarabia, literally my favorite thing
11:14 alpharad kissing men
Not Jacob putting in a single frame of him making out with a guy 😂❤
anyone know what several creators said they weren't allowed to show on screen?
E
Wait... America doesn't have double Big Macs? We even have that monstrosity in Canada.
this video took a turn i wasn’t expecting, but was happy to see play out.
I feel this so hard. When you have such an amazing friend group, it feels like nothing you can ever give will be enough to thank them. So why not a curated box of their favorite things from Japan?
this video makes me so happy, as i love seeing people I like being happy, it's great 😊 but it also makes me a bit jealous to see all this merch and knowing that i do not have the money for all that.  it's also so wholesome to see how much he cares about his friends and how thankful they are. and hearing Jacob talk about his life and happiness is so genuine and nice (?)(i can't think of a word that accurately describes my feelings, so i will just leave it as nice). phenomenal video, what an experience ❤ have a nice life
11:14 WE SAW THAT
don't think I didn't pause on you making out with Jan.
If Swedish McDonalds is S tier, you should try Max Burgers next time you're here. It's even better.
1:31 wait until Alpha finds out that Scotland is in the UK
Alpharad, this video was such a special and incredibly engaging story. Well done.
9:37 cucurucho mention LMAO
6:17 holy shit is Jan a giant? Wtf is going on
god this video was such a :)
The ending of this video made me extremely happy! I'm really happy for you, Alpha! Good for you!
Such a cutie Jacob
Every time I’m reminded about how much Japan centralizes their pop culture from their anime to video games I just get mad jealous, like god dammit world wtf are u doing
Boi if you need a break take it we'll under stand why ur mental health is important
Alfarad give me money please
Alpharad has been to scotland? 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
11:14 What the fuck
Hey Thank you for this
11:14 wild Jan appears
This is the best video I have seen in months. Not just on an entertainment level, but on an emotional one too. You deserve all the happiness in the world.
real talk though, the kid saying "sanji-san!" upon seeing alpha is really cute 😂😂
been herew for a while a vacation was well deserved i really recommend doing this way more often. we as fans want u to make quality video not quantity
JACOB X JAN  HOLY SHIT IT HAPPENED (11:13)
11:14 Playback speed 0.25 Need I say more
Ok so for real Jaiden and Alpha are having an affair no?
I didn’t gross cry over how much you love your friends 🥹💖💖 no one saw it so I’m not lying!
I mean when you were depressed you gave us some of your best content, which made us, long time followers, so happy. But on the other hand I'm so fucking happy for how you are now, and after all this years I can truly say I wish the best to your life, thank you for entertaining my life for so long.
What the f*ck does 1072 mean?
Why Netherlands so low 😭
this was a very touching video and getting more out of life than just youtube really hit close to home as someone who's also been making videos for most of their life - banger video man, i'm glad you're happy now :)
22:54 brother the street fighter cards are so cool
This video is so wholesome, but honestly it's hard not to feel envious of how happy you are in life. Your current life is something I aspire for.
jo recording on the poker table is so JOcore
Weirdly, alpharad and jackblack are my models in life  They just seem pure and if you knew them irl, you would treasure every moment with them
Haven't seen jo in forever, he looks great
11:15 SCREENSHOT, QUICK!
This video is so beatiful and alpharad seems to be so nice, there's nothing better than making your friends truly happy, probably this is alpharad's best video for me already  (btw sorry for the bad english im not american)
you should visit poland and taste our macdonalds it tastes so good
I rlly love this man holy fuck! Good for him that he's taking care of himself!
Really happy for you to go to places I’ve been to
I gotta get back into vocaloid man
1:32 As someone who lives in the UK, how dare you put our McDonalds THAT high. That shit is cardboard meat and plastic cheese.
9:32 I would be bankrupt if i could buy little darkstalkers plushes. 25:49 :o
Lil bro in the corner 💀
what a W
Oh shit why did I think path to the peak was a game? Rlly exited tho, looks fantastic
Pokemon really discovered an Infinite money hack. Just invite Alpharad out to events & he'll buy enough merch that you make the money back immediately
Oh god. bringing Jaiden to a Pokemon merch shop is the worst thing you can do to your wallet.
I can't figure out what that figurine in the background is, is that lin fire emblem?
I'm happy you're happy
what is wrong with you
I think the end of this video was wonderful. I reached a point in life where I kinda lost meaning to whatever I'm doing right now, but seeing all the gifts Alpha made to his friends really reminded of why I do all that I do in life, I do it all for my loved ones. Really weird getting reminded of such an important thing by watching a silly video on the internet but I think it gave me the push to go forward again. Once again fantastic job on the video Alpha, hope you have a good day :)
10:45 new nickname aquired
This video was so great to watch! Thank you jacob!
fuck me man that end montage was so sweet
By far my favorite Alpharad video. So glad to know you’re happy
Honestly the ending there is the kind of wholesome content we all need from time to time. Watching it put such a big smile on my face.
literally cried when ur friends opened their packages thats such a nice idea, i wish you all the best
I'm going to fucking cry bro this is the sweetest shit i ever seen
I've been watching your videos for about 6-7 years and I have to say that this is personally the best video you've ever made, maybe even the best I've ever seen.  Maybe it's just because I'm in a similar place to how you were and I've also been on a self-improvement journey for about a year. But I feel like this video has so much heart and soul poured into it, you've never been scared to talk about your mental health (which is almost a taboo topic on this platform, for some reason), which makes your speech feel more powerful.  I've always struggled with socialising, but seeing you act so confident and happy despite your social anxiety only motivates me to get better.   I just really want to say that over the years ive grown to admire you and ive been motivated to improve myself multiple times because of you!  💜🖤💜
Ireland A tire lez go
This shows how I should never be given tickets to japan with an unlimited budget or my credit or debit card. I would have to file for bankruptcy
We have double big macs in germany too, and we also have the mcrib year round, definitely a high tier mcdonalds
Can we talk about how jarring but also amazing transition 16:15 is
Japanese mcdonalds rules, I had a shrimp burger and it fucked
I'm so jealous I wanna go to Japan again too!
Take me to japan
I'm so sad I missed Worlds I wanted to watch live but I forgot! To be fair I still haven't finished scarlet so I wouldn't have gotten that much out of it...
Pokémon Pearl music ❤
what a wholesome and heartwarming end of the video. You truly embraced the gift of giving. I dont think ive ever felt so happy and excited to see someone get cool gifts.
Happy for you man lifes good been watching you for years
I love this video, as a long time viewer I've grown up so much watching you and your content evolve as I was, when you said it was 10 years ago it really got me, I didn't realise how long it's been and how much it helped my though my life, a sincere thanks from a viewer of the alfa-french comunity, This video got me really sentimental, thanks for everything, thanks for the joy you bring, and thanks for beeing happy and enjoying your life, you, as everyone, deserve happyness and nothing brings me a smile to my face more than seeing you where you are today! Wishing you and everyone reading this a brightfull future. (TLDR: 26:56 )
Jacob, as a subscriber since 2017, I am so, so happy that you are happy and in a better place. Keep loving you and we will love you too❤️
What the hell did you get PointCrow XD
Nice to see PokeChal 6:15 on the trip. Edit: I just noticed this 11:13. And no I am not referring to the karaoke.
You seem like such a good friend Jacob.
OH MY GOD THE JOLTIK
That was a good video man, i'm glad you're happy !
i cried :O
What did I learn?I would not be mentally prepared to receive this gifts,I want to go to Japan and if I went to Japan I would not be able to have money anymore because I would be Bank corrupted
Holy fuck, the final two acts of this video were unexpected but AMAZING. Super heartfelt. You rock, Jacob!
I was here before 1mil
i don't understand such glee over merchandise and possessions like those, but it's nice to see them so happy
8:21 bro's about to get maximum uzumaki'd hehe- I've watched all of jjk 3 times in a week pls help
Oh? A fellow monster hunter?
Not me lowkey crying in the end. My guy cares so much about his friends
We stan Australia peak fast food.
i'm glad this outing was a good wake up call. we hope you get to enjoy your life.
why did this video make me feel, wtf man
Hey, dont think we didnt see that little makeout sesh 😏 i see you broski
Glad to see Jan and Alpharad put their feud aside at 11:13
honestly i think alpha got infected by jaiden
Bruh I was just looking for a video to watch while I eat lunch, and now I'm crying
If this video didnt make you happy, then idk what will
The reactions were so wholesome
I will never unsee that you look like sanji
This video made me cry…
What a fucking kegend   I think I'd cry if someone got me a bunch of stuff i love lol
Sanjirad
26:04 EVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If I ever go to Japan I better have been saving up for the past 20 years
Imagine being called Sanji-San and not taking it as a compliment
this is why ur my goat man, nobody else could make a sponsored video this genuine
This video is my dream, not only being acknowledged by the Pokémon company but being flown to my dream location and getting SPONSORED by Pokémon themselves, getting to see Pokémon championships and getting everything Pokémon I see including EXCLUSIVE items never seen before, as well as a bunch of other stuff. My dream in a nutshell.
omg it got better
Wow ❤sugoi Japan kawaii 😻😻
I did not expect such a deep message nor this ending but this is fucking awesome Alpha I am moved to tears
Bro went to McDonald's and said " Ta Ma Go Onegaishimasu"
How surprising that the number 1 most profitable brand in the world, which makes the most money out of merch, would open a gigantic store solely for merch (all of this in the land of merch itself? The country where some people spend the entirety of their incomes on gacha machines, and those are everywhere?)...who could have immagined
god i love this. What a great creator.
I'm glad you had a good time Jacob :)
so cute, just a bunch of nerds having the greatest time
Next up: Pokemon bought me a bigger house! Because they know, I will pay it back in merch, now that I have more space!
oh haha the fried chicken at 4:47 says taiwan style! love taiwan fried chicken
BROOOOO... This is the first account outside of my own experience that I've seen of a blonde person's interactions with Japanese people.  I lived in Guam for a few years as a young blonde child, and Japanese tourists would frequently ask my parents to take pictures with me because of my blonde hair lol.
Im jealous
Visit back anytime! We are happy that you had a wonderful time in Japan! As a 7+ year viewer, It was great to hear that you are happy now since you gave me 7+ years worth of happiness. Treat yourself to more vacations. We will stick around.
Did someone hunt down the frame at the end of 11:13? Seemed to be two people kissing?
Omg alphrad you are An amazing person don't let anyone take that away from you, you keep being awesome and living your best life
Im glad your happy mate
:)
21:28   Hi Failboat. how are you today father.
The latter half of this video was incredibly heartwarming and insightful, but jacob kissing jan at 11:14 will absolutely be my second biggest takeaway from this video
that was so sweet
He must have spent a lot of money on that big yarn yoshi amiibo
This went from "haha look at the funny internet man overspending on funny products" to "holy shit this is way too wholesome for my heart". Actually so heartwarming at the end
Where do I get that funky blue, purple and black shirt he wears through the video
woah place, japan
1:31 Come to spain! We will be McDonalds at least A tier
thank you alpharad for single-handedly paying for gen 10
The fact that all those gifts in the end went to friends, and not only that, given in such a way that you're giving all your friends things they love shows a level of compassion you rarely see in video form, since this isn't just giving gifts, it's giving actually good gifts to so many friends, tailoring the gifts to each specific person that they all love the package, that is an amazing ending of the video.
The fact he didn't mention Carl when he was talking about the Oddish only deck girl is a crime.
not the separate british and scottish flags for the sole purpose of placing scotland lower 💀
Love how we just skipped past Jaiden's Cucurucho obssession lol
Wow the unboxing part brought a big smile. I just brought tokyo banana, kit kats, pens and keychains
What this video has taught me is that i should be a millionaire before I visit japan
I just realized how similar Japanese and Chinese is.
26 minutes well spent
the amount of persona music in th9s br8ngs me immense joy
You probably won't see this but it's great to see and hear about how good of a place you're at with yourself currently.   I believe we are somewhat close in age and I have had a similar year of change and I have also been finding my happiness so hearing about yours was inspiring.   You do great work and you're a good dude for getting all of your friends stuff from the trip. You deserve it all Alpha have a great day, you're awesome
I find it hilarious how Jacob ignores Jaidens hyperfixation even though he ignitied an amazing spending problem while being in japan
They animated the vile-pile
In a way, we're all the Alphard
1:31 Sweden represent!!
If you ever plan on coming back to Australia, try Grill’d
I came for the funny… Why you gotta hit me with the wholesome as fuck at the end bro?!
this video is so wholesome!!!
Alpharad further cements himself as letting your intrusive thoughts win personified
dear god, this video is just full of honesty, fan-service, happiness and just over-all good time.
So is anyone else gonna mention 11:14 ?   Scooch 2: The anime adaptation.
must be nice to be rich edit: i got to the end of the video. my comment still stands, but now i feel bad about saying it
When are you gonna do a nuzlocke
This has got to be one of the most special videos on the entire channel, it perfectly encapsulates everything one needs to know about Alpharad
youre such an inspiration to me and youre what i want to be when im 27. i want to be satisfied with my life, make silly videos and art, travel with my friends and make them happy! i was smiling so much just seeing your friends enjoy your gifts
The greatest trip of your bank account
Alpha continues to make a lifestyle that should feel unrelatable, feel very relatable. The near 9 minute wholesome ending had me tearing up. It’s great to see him happy and to show love to the people who have brought him that happiness.
Cdawg in the thumbnail 👌
Just gonna ask here because I couldn't find anything and was curious. But I was wondering what else pointcrow got in his gift box besides the clips "shown". Was looking on YT and twitch but it seems that segment seemingly got nuked from existence on both platforms. Seems to be a recent Kaizomon stream by the looks of things. Question will also be nuked afterwards once answered. :)
I went to Japan for a school trip and it was such a wonderful experience. People are so nice and respectful and OMG MY WALLET WAS CRYING BUT IT WAS SO WORTH IT! I BOUGHT COOL FITS AND WON A DRAGONITE PLUSH OUT OF A CLAW MACHINE 😭 we visited a lot of shrines and it was so cool! I bought some charms for my family and I. ALSO THE POKEMON CENTER WAS SO COOL! My inner child was so happy 😭 I was fangirling at everything, especially the Nintendo store
0:42 I luv when creators add Persona music to their vids 🔥🤘🏾🖤!!!
YOU BETTER HAVE PICKED UP BABBU FROM ONE IF THE STORES THERE 😂
14:52 sorry, i don't interact with the news like at all, why is this ill timed?
11:14
Hey alpha, I’m super glad you got to spend time on yourself, you have helped my mental health a lot when ive just needed something as a distraction until i can get to my support person, I honestly feel like i owe you my life sometimes because I dont know if i would still have it without you. Thank you for everything.
1:32 Dutch mcdonalds in C is something I’m baffled by as a Dutch person, but on the other hand, I can sort of understand
Why is no one talking about 11:13 kissing?
That's a beautiful kiss there brother
Can we just talk about 11:14?
Okay, I did not expect to cry from a video I thought was about Jacob's spending habits
You are an adorable guy Alpha
Hope u know u gave each and every sigle one of us our own mystery box through these videos
Beautiful video
The Zoro Easter egg in the thumbnail is peak
Probably the best Alpharad video ever
Alphard is genuinely the best creator on this platform! and I'm here for it
That ending was the most heartwarming thing ive seen in a while
1:31 Australia is S Tier? Is it that much better than American?
“Yooooo snoopy”
I was in Japan this year and saw those exact stairs! 1:11
11:14 AYO?! Better love story than twilight
you know you now have to make the Jaiden and build up a whole new shelf (or more like several) just for your new merch right?
So no one is going to mention that Alpha and Jan kissed
Jan is Tall? 6:17
11:14   <3
Alpha your just amazing and you do so many amazing things especially for your friends. ❤
Who was Alpha making out with at 11:14? lmao
NOT ME CRYING AT HIS FRIENDS OPENING GIFTS! AAAAAAAAAAA
I know this is stupid, but this made me legitimately emotional.  I've been watching Alpharad since How To Play Mega Man in the beginning of 2015.  I've watched Alpha work on so many projects, from series like A Story For Glory, the Not series, and Opening The DMs, to entire channels like FWOB, Replay Hut, and Alpharad Plus/Deluxe/Gold.  Heck, even a fantastic band in the form of Ace of Hearts!  Just seeing the growth that this channel and Alpha himself have gone through over the years, making new friends and bigger videos has been incredible.  I remember him talking about how unhappy he was when he felt trapped making How to Play videos, and hearing how happy he is now is just so wonderful to hear, and seeing him bring smiles to all of his friends' faces was just so awesome.  I don't know Jacob, but it's been quite a journey just watching this channel, and I look forward to many more years to come!
This Video Made me tear Up. Im Happy for you my Guy and everything you do and that you are Happy. Im Just Here surviving and thinking, but watching someone living Happy and His Dreams makes my day. Thank you Alpha
Was I the only one who saw him kissing at 11:13 min? 😂
i played the karaoke in .25 and confirmed i wasnt seeing things
Are we not going to talk about 11:14?
I totally get you, I went to Japan with my girl with 1 big suitcase for 2 weeks but heading back home we bought a 2nd (expensive-ish) suitcase filled with souvenirs
🎉🎉 trying new things.🎉🎉
You are the real one Jacob ❤
This was truly a heartwarming video and something i really enjoyed! I hope your trip was everything you wanted and more, man!
11:14 did i saw right?
I loved the video, you got to do everything I could imagine in Japan. So much cool merch and the speech at the end was inspirational too. Nice work
What is this frame😂😂 11:14
11:14, it finally happened bois, the ship is real
Jacob THe only person to be sponsored by Pokemon and comes out with less money than when he started
Jesus. I cried at the end.  Alpharad I'm just happy for you. <3  Love your content for 5-6 years now and it makes me happy to see you this happy hahaha <3
He was very smart to also fly out jaiden to help carry his bags
This channel is awesome
11:13 best part
11:14 Ok so they finally kissed, thank god
I started tearing up like pokemon mystery dungeon sky when i saw you walking around Japan on that final day....man
Oh Hatsune mikus a singer? I’d assumed an anime character from the Pokémon card crossover thing currently going on but that actually makes so much more sense lol
I have a feeling that Gieu might like Shanks One Piece
I'm speechless... That was awesome and heartwarming and inspiring af, one of the best videos ever ❤
Keep spending money
Damn
how DARE you insult dutch mcdonalds?!
if mr beast was a weeb
The title: My response: Lucky
This is the most wholesome thing, and I just love hearing your friends say how much you know and remember things they like. Everyone needs a Jacob in their life
So... Did you just kiss another dude? At 11:13?
11:14 I can’t be the only one who’s seen that, that’s an unexpected twist lmao
Oh my God, that ending. I was smiling the moment you started alluding to it. I can't imagine how happy you must've been while boxing everything, knowing exactly how great it would make your friends feel.
you _do_ look like Sanji
11:14 are we gonna ignore the fact alpharad was making out with pchal
1:31 I also have a McDonald's tier list! It's super interesting trying out the different local specialties/adaptations that McDonald's has depending on the country. My top 3 so far are Japan, Aus, and HK
LOL SANJI SAN
Seeing all the reactions of the people getting the stuff was really heart-warming. Also very nice that you had an awesome trip to Japan
So are we gonna talk about that one frame at 11:14?   No..? Okay
This has been the weirdest video experience in my life. The video is great, but I'm currently ill and put on this video to get away from it all. But seeing the food legitimately made me throw up, and now I'm feeling much better... So thanks alpharad? Your video has magical vomit inducing healing powers?....
GODDAMMIT THAT KOBE STATUE WAS CREEPY AS SHIT WHEN I WAS THERE
Wow it’s hard to explain but this video is incredible and just made me so happy seeing Alpharad happy and living their dreams
Comment for boost ❤
Top 3 alpharad vids of all time and it’s not 2 or 3
look at 11:14 wtf man
I'm really happy to see you enjoy your job and trip so much and it honestly inspires me to want to put more effort towards my channel I'm just struggling with the equipment is all but that's a personal problem just want to say your an inspiration and I'm glad your happy
I’m so happy that Australian McDonald’s is on the top of your list
11:14
The Pokemon company knew what they were doing when they let all the poketubers get early access to the pokemon store, that one excursion must've more than offset the cost of flying them out for worlds
the ending was super cute, I almost started crying
good to see my country having the best Maccas 😊
I fucking love alpharad
10:22 Only noticed just now how Sanji coded Alpha's new design is
bruh i was in japan at the same time as alpharad
I wonder how much he ended up spending in Japan
Uugh, Fernweh 😭 Incredible video, I’m definitely a bit jealous
Double big mac been in canada for a long while too😭
11:13 ayo? you can't just zoom by something so... *wholesome*
6:16 ITS HIM
I have never been so offended as when a small child called me Sanji-San. Now, I know that this didn't happen to me, but still, just the thought was enough...
I had to cry a bit at the end there ngl...
whats zoro doeng?
1:30 how tf is netherkands c tier??
I'm so glad you're happy dude!
This make me smile so much man
Today I spent $60 on some Pokémon TCG (I wanted some pretty cardboard pictures of Paldean Pokémon, since I didn't have any) and I even had a giftcard to pay for some of it. I was sitting here feeling kind of guilty for doing that over the last few hours. I no longer feel like that and I'm not even halfway through the video yet. 😂 I WISH I had the income to be this financially irresponsible.  Maybe one day.   Edit: I'm near the end of the video and now I'm crying. HOW DARE YOU, SIR. As someone who loves to give gifts to my friends, you are living my dream right now. I'm so happy for you and your friends. 💖 Worth it.
I bet Jan went hard at that karaoke
This man is one of the greatest treasures this god forsaken website has ever produced…
Uh oh Conner and alpharad crane video coming soon?
I've needed a good positive cry for a bit and this video just sent me by the end of it. I've been watching every video you put out since early 2015 if not late 2014, and it's insane to look back and see it's been almost 10 years now. For a while there, I wasn't sure if you'd keep making content for much longer, seeing the state of your mental health, but having you here today, actually /happy/, was such an emotional wake up. You've always been a huge inspiration, and definitely a massive reason I started making content myself, even though this channel is still pretty new and underdeveloped.  I don't leave comments much, but couldn't help myself by the end of this video, even if no one ever really sees this, let alone yourself. I'm glad you're happy, so glad you have a big support system of friends, and it was so touching to see you spend such a massive amount on all of those friends that you hold close to you.  Thank you Jacob Alpharad.
How am I more jealous he went to Magical Mirai than going to Pokemon Worlds?
Wow, don't even mention Hello Kitty, just Hatsune Miku in her Project Diva model.
Double mic Mac is great on someday seeing you got McDonald's Australia how did you not see double mic mac
11:14
JACOB THE LEGEND ALFERAD. Thank for serving the community so your friends can deserve the reward of your hard work through that trip of a life time in Japan
Every time I watch an alpha vid there's like a split second halfway through shen I remember he's hot it's pretty jarring
nice
Happy Alpha is best Alpha <3
A national treasure
this jealoussy is making me tear up
Alpha, please tell me you're an Eve fan
I've added all the numbers Alpharad showed on screen and they add up to 3259483 yen or 21842,73 $ and right now thats about what i make in a year
OMG SANJI YOUTUBE CHANNEL
that ending was so incredibly touching, I did not expect it, and I do not mind.
May Alpharad's wallet R.I.P. 🙏
Good to hear you've been working to find more happiness. And was that Jan you were kissing? Nice.
me: oh wow, he really spent a lot of money on this trip, this surely got out of hand!  *realise that I'm not even 10 minutes in*  me: OH......
The ending of the video was so wholesome and emotional I almost cried even if I don't know any of you in person and just see your "content creator persona". You really look like great friends and I'm very happy you got to finally feel happy about your life and had the chance to show your gratitude to all your friends like this Alpha
This was so wholesome i may not have recieved any gifts cause you don't even know me but i can sure speak in name of all of your friends and viewers and say thanks jacob for those gifts you gave them and all of the fun videos you make
AAAAAAAA I WANT TO GO THERE!!1!1!1😢😭
Sanjirad
Him sneaking a kiss with Jan at 11:14 lmao
You can take time off. Takeing a brake means you'll just keep pumping bangers out even more. Keep your mental state up alpha
"I play modded games and say fuck" - best channel description ever 💖
The obvious dubbing when he splices in footage of him “talking” is driving me crazy.
i would've never expected a video about a guy accidentally spending like, millions of yen on merch to have the most heartwarming last 6 minutes I've gotten out of a video this month, and honestly I'm glad i didn't ever expect it.
Honestly could be my video of the year, it had every emotion, the experience of Japan was incredible and makes me really want to go next year, Jacob it’s absolutely great to hear you’re in an amazing space at the moment, being here since the Pokemon Sun supercut, you’ve always been a guarantee for great comedy and entertainment, so to find this really entertaining and you wanting to make this type of content makes me really happy, Thanks for all the amazing videos you’ve made since Sun :]
NORWAYS MCDONALD’S SUCKS ASS YOU SHOULD OF TRIED BUGER KING. ASK ANYONE THERE AND THEY SAY THAT BURGER KING IS BEST
So we're not gonna talk about the Ace statue? Got it
Gosh this was amazing
15:31 Conner?!? CDawgVA!?? That you???
Thats a one of the wholesome video from entire world alright
Good old based Alpharad.  never forget space jam.
11:14 AYO ALPHARAD HAVING SOME BROMANCE?
That kid mistook you for a blonde character from one piece 😂
11:14 ❤
It was surreal seeing your story posts about japan while being there on vacation myself.
Holesome Alpharad is the best Alpharad
I also have this strange pokemon consumerism addiction but sadly as a child i cannot obtain the goods
such a great friend you are jacob :)
Watching this video blind I was like "another funny haha video from Jacob, let's sit back and enjoy" and then it transformed itself in the most sincere speech about friendship and happiness in general. AND THEN in the most cutest give away between your friends. I really love your content Jacob, now more than ever
As someone that lived over there for a year...yep.  7-Eleven is where I went pretty much daily for a quick snack of karaage or an onigiri.  It's incredibly convenient and can be found pretty much everywhere.
Great video!
The Double Big Mac is also in Canada. I have NO IDEA why it isn’t in the US and it catches me off guard whenever I get McD’s.
Gotta say though, from my point of view you have never sounded or looked happier in any other video outside of laughter. It’s good to see you got this far up, I wouldn’t have called it when I first saw your vids all those years ago.
Thank you Alpha for that video. You made my day ❤
11:14 hola hola hola hola hold up good sir, wind back and slow mow...ooooooohh yeeeeaaaaah, what is Alpharad if not an excuse for yaoi
i just woke up, i have job in less then 5h and now im crying real wholsome video, thank you for your content, keep it going please
New Zealand next? I wanna know what you think of us-
Phenomenal hm.. Well, get ya stacks fam 😂😂
11:14 Don't think we didn't see that.
11:14 AAAYOOOO????!?!?!?!????🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈
Man I’ve been subscribed for so long I think I’ve watched every video from you for the last two years and It feels great to see that your happy
i wasn't expecting you to open up a little bit about yourself (and i most certainly didn't know you have social anxiety). it's so good to know you're doing better in life. do whatever makes you happy <3
11:49 I saw this nine frame of perfection
11:14 we saw that
I'm just happy you're still using a hat in time music
All jokes aside, I'm so glad that you're feeling better hell I remember when you moved into the pool house, when you bleached your hair and everything else up to this point, I felt terrible when you were down on your self, and I was happy when you started streaming again after a while, and I don't know if it was your depression that led to you bleaching your hair but you pulled it off, point is I'm glad that your happy again and we can definitely start seeing more fun times in the future
what did you and yan get up to when drunk hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?
This Video really feels like the season finale or something
I saw those nine frames ...
Amazing video Sanji-San, now you’ll have 3 rooms full of plushies!
Weeb heaven
11:13 Bru though he could sneak that shit and we wouldn't notice😂
You went to shibuya? Glad you got out before the incident
Jacob is doing a MrBeast but just for his friends 😂
That Shanks jacket is so bloody damn cool. Daaaamn!  Such cool things!
the gift stream compilation made me cry
11:14 nothing more nothing less
11:14
This was a very wholesome video <3
this was really cool (but i am also really jealous)
Amazing video. Made me happy
I apologize for the chain food in the Netherlands on behalf of my fellow Dutch people
Want happy? Play btd6🎉done
lmao did you give pointcrow the porn from 7-11
Even in the thumbnail Zoro is lost
G.O.A.T.
The positive vibes the ending gave me are insane
Japan is a terrible place from what i understand. i wish the pokemon company would move their headquarters into US America but they are potentially enjoying previliges that no other person in Japan gets to enjoy. i'm not saying i'm knowledgeable on Japans laws and such but i got some info and from what i understand you would not want to live there, especially if somehow you become homeless. i'd be happy to be wrong.  5:34 LARGE dragonair plushie goes for about $30 5:37 i think that plushie is going for about $12
So what I learned from this video is that Japan is Fortnite
my dude spent more in japan than I have ever seen in my entire life
Anyone else notice alpha kissing a man? 11:14
Japan Stores knew what they were doing by keeping all the merch
So, none noticed the kiss with Jan? Huh...
When did u go to Sweden?
the smooch 😳
W 11:14 moment
SWEDEN MCDONALDS IN S TIER 🔥🔥🔥
THAT IS WHY THIS DUDE IS THE GOAT!  Long shot, but tell us when you're headed to Seattle next. I'd like to just chat for a bit over lunch.   Sincerely, a total stranger with no clout
crazy that yaki almost made it in this vid
What an outrage! You didn't get a single Joltik for Jaiden? What do you mean you went there with her? What do you mean she could've bought her own?! I'm going to unsubscribe, just so I can subscribe again, then unsubscribe again, so you feel the sting twice.   Then I'll sub again because all of this is needlessly silly. Great video man. I think you spent more money in that one trip than I'm likely to ever make in my life, at the rate I'm going.
14:18 the flashing text appearing and disappearing hurts my eyes. Thankfully it’s only 2 seconds but that could’ve been a seizure warning. 😢
impulsive shopping, DAMN WISH I WAS YOU.  AND GIVING ALL YOUR FRIENDS A SHIT TON OF MERCH, also want to do that, as you said. Friends help you get to where you are...  you really had a fun time and shared with your viewers wich is nice, love a good, happy and possibly life changing story  thank you sanji-san   also yeah,  take the vacations you want if you really think you need it, but never forget about the life you built on this platform ok? Just dont overwork yourself
As someone who constantly worries about never achieving true happiness, hearing you say "I'm happy" hit different. Enjoy your life to the fillest my guy, you made it.
This whole video is just all my dreams coming true. You are living the life i always wanted to live and i am sitting here stuck in Turkey hoping the weekend comes so i can play with my 13 years old ps3. Not to shit on people's enjoyments but man i wish my whole life for something like this and it seems like its never going happen.
yooooo australia has s tier mcdonalds
Man, even if you need a year-long vacation, we will support you. You're the Internet funny man, you deserve a break every once in a while. ❤
Dude where’s the haul check
When i went to Japan a few years back, 7-11 was my saving grace financially.
Cash is an illusion
i am so happy to hear that you're happy! You for sure deserve it. The amount of times you made me laugh in my dark times makes me glad you posted but now hearing that you're happy makes me extremely happy!!!!
That ended was spectacular
who’s the streamer at 22:07
How good that you hid the price at 0:03 ... just that you forgot the second price tag. Uffa wow big statue expensive.
the boy kisser alpha wth
YOU WATCHED 1072 LIVE THATS INSANE BRO
boy kisser👆
despite not eating maccas ever, i have a strange sense of national pride for Aus being S tier for alpharad
what is the song that plays when all his friends are receiving his gifts?
I love how he knows all his friends so well that he gave them personal gifts they genuinely loved🥺
LOVE EVERYTHING FOR YOU AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME. HOPING TO BE ABLE TO WATCH UNTIL WE COME TO THE END
Yeah the Dutch McDonalds slander is 100% justified
Does someone know where he got the shirt he is wearing in the video? I need it, it's vital to me
Jaiden has infected him with a pokemon plushy adicrion!
This is just so beautiful. I realized upon watching this, that I am very heavily work-obsessed and don’t really build social relationships similarly to how Jacob said for himself.  That got me thinking about where to even begin to build up my social life more. I know you aren’t a therapist or anything, and I doubt you are reading this. I just want to say thank you for helping me to start asking the question “am I happy?”.
That kid calling him Sanji is beyond hilarious
Sanji-san!
8:39 Okay, an entire store rack of Pyra and Mythra amiibo hurts. I somehow managed to get mine at list price, and that *still* hurts.
If i was you, my wallet would be empty to
Alpha flexing by living all our dream 😢😂❤ <3 just happy to see him and jaiden happy ahaha love this 2
Did I saw a frame of a very gay kiss at around 11:15?
ngl i teared up near the end  Wish you the best for your future endeavours  jacob!
Your accountant was Jaiden "buying all the Pokemon plushes" Animations? Well that explains everything.
love ya alpha ❤
We appreciate you Jacob and we‘re very happy for you, that you‘re finally feeling good ❤
7:36 No, it's to turn all that merch into a tax write-off
The way zoro got lost in the thumbnail😂
Manu jumpscare
11:14 HUH?????
This is the beginning of his mr beast arc
This video made my cry but i don't think thats bad
Jesus the last part made me really emotional and I dont know why. That was really a trip not only for Jacob but for everyone he knew. What a great friend.
What a wholesome ending:)
The most wholesome ending ❤
Dude spent more money on his friends than I have in my entire bank account, what a legend.
Can anyone tell me the what the music is called during the friends opening their gift part. I know it's from Diamond/pearl but I can't seem to figure it out
alpharad
Sanji-san!!!
aww i couldn’t stop smiling at the end seeing everyone so grateful for the gifts that was so sweet
Man I've been watching you since the sm4sh days and I gotta say you've remained one of my favorite YouTubers ever. I'm always happy to see you post, always brightens my day. And you have grown so much its crazy, because I feel as if I've also grown with you. I'm 16 now and so much in my life has changed but you've been one constant in this crazy life and I can't tell how much I, and the fans appreciate you. I know you may not see this but, we all love you Jacob! ❤
Petition to call Jacob Sanji from now on
Love ur vids Jacob. Have a wonderful life :)
The last part of the video was really unexpected but amazing.   You probably won’t see this Mr. Alpharad but watching you since I was in highschool and seeing you grow has a person has really motivated me to take care of myself and keep living through life. From the storytelling in your content, to your humor, to these little peeks into your life about how much of a person you are on the other side.  I’m so happy that you are happy and that you are such a good friend for those who have supported you this whole time. Enjoying the journey and looking forward to the future.   Cheers🎉
Jacob and Jan at 11:14 😩😳
This ending was so wholesome that I nearly cried. Thanks for the awesome video Alpharad and I wish you the best things of the world for you and your friends.
Im gonna cry of happiness. Going to Japan is now on my bucket list
15:05 I see you Wolfey
idk this comes off as 2017 ricegum to me, not a huge fan
what is with hawaii?
So called "free thinker" when they go to japan
This is why Alphrad will always be the internets #1 Funny Internet Man.
Cool but I think it needs more Kirby.
Love the Persona music
Alpharad is so generous 😊😊😊
Holdup, now I want to know what's wrong with the Dutch McDonalds. If my man is roasting our 'frietsaus' I'll be mildly upset.
I went to Japan the other week. Can confirm it's VERY easy to spend a lot of money, especially with all the Pokemon shops there (I went to 3 different stores 😂) Shibuya has a massive shopping center with Pokemon, Nintendo, Capcom and loads of other bits there.
bro why did u give that speach im bawling my eyes out T^T
Every video this man uploads is a roller coaster of an experience. Absolute GOAT!
No way Alpharad arrived when I left💀
THEY KISSED???????????
omg the kid calling you sanji-san THATS SO CUTE 🥺
This is the best tax write off ive ever seen
The pokemon company is just like a casino inviting Alpharad and giving him free stuff to further fuel his addiction but also give them more money.
*11:14* youre welcome
6:17 included the best nuzlocker in the world (not pictured) and Jan Pokémon Challenges, who still hopes to regain his title.
D tier for dutch mcdonalds? thats a violation
best money used by Jacob, that's for sure
This is heart warming damn
So nice of you to think of your friends!  Blah blah commercialism and all that, but I hope you had a restful vacation, man!
11:58 NOCTOWL AND HOOTHOOT SPOTTED
I’m very happy that you are happy alpharad. I’ve been watching since I was in middle school which is absolutely jarring since I’m an adult now. It is incredible seeing a small part of your journey and It’s nice looking back on the years of your channel and remembering how much I’ve grown. You have helped shaped the man I’ve become with your comedy and “wit”. Truly thank you alpharad :)
Thank you for the McDonald’s tier list now I know it is not just me who hates McDonald’s in Norway
As a Japanese, we will welcome you Alpharad!
Dang Japanese child u won’t let me I see how much alpha looks a little like sanji with the new look
What happened with Eric?
WAIT HAWAI? HOLY SHIT IM GOING THERE NEXT YEAR WHAT A COINCIDENCE
"Yeah mewtwo is the last one, guys"     *hisuian decidueye*
20:53 can someone tell me the song.
Watching this proved why I subscribed to you, you are both hilarious and have an incredible heart. The gifts at the end had me touched beyond words. Incredible video. I’m glad you enjoyed a well deserved vacation. Here’s to being happy 🥂
Atleast you got the old mermaid figure not the new one 🤣🤣
I love you so much your so cool i love every second i get to watch your videos
9:34 I love the Khezu plushes, they look like baby birds waiting to be feed.
i fucking love you jacob
25,500 roughly in us money if people are wondering, money well spent to have memories of a life time that he gets to share with us, hope you remain happy.
this is so incredibly wholesome and it’s so so so sweet to see all his friends opening their boxes of gifts. the fact that jacob remembers the little things and gives such thoughtful and heartfelt gifts to his loved ones is beautiful. seeing the joy on their faces certainly brought a smile to my face too! it always makes me happy when someone has found their people 💛
Jacob did you end up going to Artnia while in Shibuya? It’s the Square Enix Cafe
Ok, so i was thinking “damn the Pokémon company are spending a lot of money to fly you and all these other content creators out to Japan and to all these places and events.” However after seeing your wallet I think they got the better end of the deal here, especially since it’s tempting me to waste every dime in a trip to Japan, especially since I love both Pokémon and monster hunter.
Seeing that speech about depression made me think of Ace of hearts. Those same emotions are really visible in the songs and the lyrics. Go for it champ love your best liv
Wow that was a lot to take in Amazing video
I've never been happier for someone to go to a miku concert
He paid for everyone's tickets with that
You can say 50 shades of fucked up in a sponsored Pokémon video?
"what would i do next" . . . . . Thats.....a good question...... Maybe.....try to make my friends as happy and close to me as i can while still doing videos i love, although i havent done animation in awhile, i still make videos on my other channel and its fun  But if i had the trip you had alpharad, id.... pretty much do what you had, minus....the large spending habit😅  Besides, your one of the people that kinda inspired me to make videos in the first place, hell, i now have 100 subs on my other channel and im planning on making my first yt stream sometime soon and im both excited and nervous about it   And i dont regret it, having fun not my life, my life is hell, but doesnt mean i cant make a few jokes about it So alpharad, i thank you for what youve done, and i plan to do as much as i can, with what i have.....even if i can only temporarily make videos on a singular platform...😅 Thank you roblox. . . . . And god speed
You just gave me an itinerary
Was following your trip on insta stories and it was just so fun watching you have fun! Plus I could mentally prepare myself for my own Japan trip I did in September 😆
honestly nearly teared up with the gift openings, just the music and seeing how well you know ALL of your friends really motivates me to progress further in life because I feel the same exact way about my friends, the whole 10 years owing it all to your friends moment actually hit different.
Jacob kissing Jan was exactly the result I predicted when Jan's first ever reaction to the Onix clip occurred, easiest enemies to lover story line I've ever seen unfold
The one sponsored segment I won't skip past
Jacob is a really good friend. He may have a large friend group, but he obviously knows each one of them really well!  Thanks for always working so hard to bring joy to our lives Jacob ♥️
11:14 wut why how??? explain
im suprised he even went back to USA
Do this more Alpharad
I think this video taught us 3 things about Jacob Alpharad  1) He truly and wholeheartedly enjoys what he does, entertaining us viewers - has struggled with his own issues but has found his own happiness.  2) He genuinely knows every single one of his friends to the bone. Heartwarming to see that he got gifts for his friends that he knew they'd all like.  3) He has A LOT of money.  So thank you Alpharad for always being an excellent person, friend and YouTuber. One of the more elite channels out there.
Or as they would say in japan, 日本に行った、お金を使いすぎた。
Am I the only one who saw him kissing some dude at 11:14 for like a split second? lol
Touhou
Dude is an inspiration fr
dude i almost started crying about jacob saying how happy they are with their life now, i remember 2020 and how things were then so im so so happy that things are better now <3 love you jacob, you deserve all the happiness in the world
This kind of stuff is what keeps me working towards the future that I want to build. I want to be able to spoil those that mean so much to me. Thank you Jacob
Oh how Japan changes a man thank you Sanji-San for providing us with countless entertainment over the years and I can only hope that your future will be better than ever 🙏🎉🎉🎉❤❤
日本語上手!
You heard the lady you better do it
but like let’s be real, Alpha’s growth and like journey from unhappiness to being the god he is today. Is so unbelievably heartwarming and wonderful. Alpha, I’m happy you’re happy. Real Happy. Keep popping off in life brother.
Oh the Miku backpack looks good!
Im glad you are in a happier place
you saw the premiere show!
I bought my totk Oled Switch in the shibuya nintendo store
11:14 is wild
Nice to see Pokemon Company supports creators who support cheaters in their game, lol.
What happens In Hawaii?
It's crazy just how many things you ended up bringing back.
What was that song during the montage? Tears.
Jacob " anxiety 👉🏽😎👉🏽 " Alpharad deserves all the time and happiness in the world
SO that's why Jaiden is not uploading, SHES IN JAPAN JAPAN TRIP PT 2 PLEEEAASE
Your best work yet. Right in the feels...
Jan is a friend.
That was a good video ❤
Bruh zoros lost in the thumbnail
This has got to be the best Alpha video I’ve seen in a bit. Well done, funny man ❤️
25:31 everyone being wholesome and then there’s pointcrow LUL
AYO WHAT WAS THAT @11:12?
I've experienced so much joy throughout this video thanks Jacob
I haven’t cried tears of joy in a while but that last chapter of the video got to me. Thank you Alpha.
So true that Dutch McDonalds is C its so wacky
11:14 is that Jan? If so, the story arc concludes very satisfyingly
I am just happy for you that you are feeling happy. I have been watching you for a long time and seeing you grow like this with me is just so cool.
jacob in the shibuya incident spending thousands of dollars
It actually makes me just so happy to see Jacob be so happy and try his best to give his thanks to his friends, it really is just making me as even only a fan just cry out of happiness and wholesomeness at this point.  Keep going Alpharad... you are always doing your best and we all love it.
Bro is friends with redhawk 💀 21:43
i cant even lie, jacob def has some of the most entertaining videos on yt and gotta give him props for that thank you so much for giving us such amazing content and for being who you are. absolutely loved this video <3
This is the most wholesome thing I have seen all year. Happy for you Jacob!
I’m glad you’re _truly happy,_ Alpha.
The thumbnail is so cool and detailed!!!
i wish i was you but also you played paladins???
Why am I tearing up?
Alpharad in Trash Taste when?
i have never smiled harder in my life this is so sweet
i have never smiled harder in my life this is so sweet
Oh my god Alpharad and Jan kissed, I need the lore!!
loved every second of this video
Alpha being mistaken for Sanji is something I never thought about... But I can't stop thinking about now.
I wish i had money. I would buy so many pokemom things.
This video made me cry in the midst of my struggles in my 4th yr of college. I hope I could do the things you do rn to your friends jacob. Keep being you dude. Please dont do stupid shit that will ruin your life and career. Much love to you dude.
W alpharad
Damn i really wanna know what pointcrow got now lmao
Someone tell me I imagined the clip of a kiss at around 11:12
In norway burger king is better than McDonald's
im such a sucker, i didnt expect going into this video that i'd end up crying T_T
You know for a fact Jacob was crying, making the ending as wholesome as it is
Wkwkwkwkkwkwkwkw
Was gonne be like "Yeah, i totally get spending this much cash at the stores there, all the merch you'd have to pay double/tripple for otherwise". However, your talk about your life and finding out happiness in it, followed by seeing your friends just excited about all the stuff you send them? This was very, very dang good to watch
Legit tears !!! What a great travel video while surprising friends but a male influencer talking about mental health???? YOU JUST LOVE TO SEE IT!!!!
I just finished watching a Yokohama guide done by Martina and her editor on KingKogi.  Nice to see another perspective on the city.
Ah, seeing Japanese manga just on shelves would be a literal dream…
11:14 I dunno if this time-stamp will catch it, but I just saw something life-changing.
Alpha is so kind and considerate for letting Connor be in the video for about 1 second
YOU GOT TO SEE EVE LIVE !!!!!!!
I'm curious, how much of this video was just so the exorbitant amount of spending would become a tax write off?
This video was such amazing chaos I love every minute of it - and also the slow burn enemies to lovers(?) over the past year or two that has led up to Jan and you kissing lol
Damn, didn't expect the vid to get so real. Congrats on feeling happy
alpharad being so autistic he remembers all his friends favorite pokemon/anime and buys them merch. i kinda wish i was alpharads friend
I don't even buy merch and that merch shop looks holy O.O
are we just going to pretend 11:14 didnt happen???????
HES GAY?!
Indians and filipinos who is watching this wishing they were in Japan anime land
this video had it all, laughter, emotion, friendship, laughter again. I only started watching you recently but I know for sure I won't stop watching until I've done the same things as you have
Lets gooo Australia is an S tier, thank god I live in this country
Yeah I cried......
Let’s go Yen for Yen right now
My dream is to be like Jacob: going to a trip to Japan, have the time of my life and then spend ludicrous amounts of money to make my friends happy :)
I am so excited for Pokémon to actually come to Hawaii
Leaving a comment for the algorithm
I didn't think this video was gonna make me sob, but here we are. Thank you for sharing some much needed positivity. 💖💖
I actually met you in Japan very briefly when my friend asked for a picture I was just way too anxious to ask for one and a signature on my mat but it was so awesome :3
Bro's had 50 mental breakdowns just editing the footage of him burning his wallet.
I feel like the input vs output is a real fallacy for big YouTubers. In the end, the best Videos are about you having a good idea and leaving the rest to a talented editor. Their job exists for a reason after all. You have your weight to pull and they have theirs.
Best maccas? Yeah aussies!!!
Very wholesome video Alpharad. Ive been watching your videos for like 6 years now and i have loved every video youve ever done. Keep up the good work my guy and enjoy as much time you as you need.
Why did this feel so insincere?
Hate to be that guy..... but.... Possible Alpharad Trash Taste episode recorded?
Who Else Watched This Is Slow Mo And Saw Jacob Kiss?
Imma go to Japan to see their 7-Eleven's
Lol australian maccas sucks. Must be pretty bad overseas then lol.
my goat
Altrive losing his shit over the chopper "baby on board" sign is amazing
One day I want to be successful enough to be able to drop gifts on gifts on the people in my life that mean so much to me. I want to be like you. I'm speaking it into existence.
11:14      AYO 🤨
I loved that last just montage, gave me a smile seeing all them so happy
Really nothing can compare to joy from one's own earnest, self acknowledged, heart
The twist that keeps us coming back. Was cool to watch it build, but to what payoff? The reveal: and now my face hurts from grinning. The wholesome madlad we all need more of.
thanks to this video i yet again got hit with how cranky, nihilistic and mentally old i am, thanks jacob
Great video first 3 quarters a funny and insightful full look into jacobs life and ideology, last quarter a sweet rendition of his love for his freinds, brings a tear to my eyes
Such a great end to the video, wholesome
I am incredibly proud to say I grew up watching you, you are so inspirational both as a YouTuber and as a person and I dream to have the growth you have worked hard for in  both of those fields, keep up the good work man we're all happy for you :)
11:13 oh my
I try to avoid being a bit sentimental with creators because of the whole para-social relationship thing, but hearing how happy you’ve managed to become over the last few years and how much your friends have helped with that is honestly really sweet, and it’s honestly so important.  Hopefully you continue to maintain that for your own sake.
Been following Alpha since 2017 and he had been my favourite content creator since I discovered him, I’m so happy to hear that you’re doing better in the past couple months and I hope that continues keep doing what makes you happy because as a long as you feel happy you’re able to make all of us happy.
Alpharad, this is the video that we have been needing. Showing how much you have grown not only in number but in personal growth. Hearing you say that you are happy is all I needed for one of my favorite YouTubers. Keep up the mental health and enjoy what you have built!
Sanji-san
Last 7 minutes was definitely the best (also good to know how many suitcases to consider if I ever go to Japan)
What could they not show on stream?
👾
11:14  for everyone else coming over from gold: the way home
❤❤❤
You are amazing
wow ur so confident in your vids, i couldnt even think about you having anxiety
this man spent more than 4 grand in USD
21:07 ALTRIVE CHAT SQUAD
omg is that my friend dellapikmin @ 24:08
2:19 kikis delivery service (:
Ah, visiting Japan. One of the very many things I wish I could do but will never be able to afford to and makes me want to commit die. I appreciate the whole "i haven't been living life" speech, but you'll be living a way better life than me. I dream of the day I could afford to do ANYTHING
Just wanted to say that I've been watching you since the very first how to play 101 all those years ago and you're still my favorite content creator today. You are a genuine inspiration.
Love this video
Watching this vid made me feel pain with the amount of bad economic decisions he did
wow this made me tear up, who would have thought the funny internet man i've loved to watch for 8-9 years would have done something as amazing as that. im glad you had a great time on your trip alpharad, thank you for providing content even when you were feeling down. it genuinely puts a smile on my face to see you say you're actually happy. much love.
Sometimes you just have to do you. Take your time to enjoy yourself. Mental health and happiness comes first.
This feels special in a way that I think we say about Alpharad's content a lot but shouldn't undervalue. This man went to his favorite place, made videos for a week for a sponsor, then just ditched the camera, lived his best life for two more weeks, and made the most of it. And then, just because he's him, he spent a massive chunk of his time there thinking of gifts to give a huge number of people, because that's what he wanted to do with his dream vacation. The end of this video is really lovely, because I feel like you can see the smile on his face throughout. The amount of it that's just people reacting excitedly to personal touches, or being surprised he noticed something, or just being happy about something special is so sweet.  Jacob, I don't know what this next chapter looks like, that speech sounds like big picture stuff and I don't know where you'll end up with all of that. But I'm truly, deeply happy that your success gives you these opportunities, and it's a credit to your character that what you take joy in always includes making the people around you happy. I hope that continues, and if it does then you're a hell of a success in my book.
Alpha you made me cryyyy;(
Dude!! This whole video is really damn wholesome despite the *ahem* spending haha. But the ending with you giving so many gifts to your friends is just so heartwarming. I’m really happy you’re super happy dude. Trying to find happiness is really hard at times.
That PChal kiss though, we love a frenemies to lovers arc
Alpha really went through  "five stages of vacationing" from questionable food choices to Irresponsible spending to Reminiscing past to Appreciating life to Bringing back gifts! What a lad✨
I wish I had a way of making as much money as you do. I'd do anything to have that much money. I'd spend so much of it making people i love happy.
Did anyone catch the fact that at like 11:14 Jacob was sucking face with someone and he quickly skimmed past it...📸
You are the best human 🥹
I liked the Splatoon merch.
It's always a joy to see you and everyone so psyched and happy, thanks for opening up Jacob. See you and all of your friends next video :D
11:14 MR RAD???
So is nobody gonna talk about what’s going on during 11:14
I'm honestly blown away that the red wall at 12:52 sources the artists
so we're just gonna ignore jan kissing alpharad
Like goddamn man. I felt a lot of that  in my soul. Hitting me in the feels at the end, straight up made me cry as you gave your friends all the stuff you bought. I hope to one day be able to do the same, buy as much stuff, for all those friends I hold so dear to me as well. Your an amazing man Alpharad
What a great video ❤
Jacob, these constant sound effects make me want to die. Stop treating me like I’m 5. Please.
Glad you’re happy. I haven’t truly been happy for a long while. Just fleeting feelings I chase to make myself feel a little better, but I know I’m truly alone and bitter deep down.
11:14 hello???
This was the most wholesome Alpharad video I’ve ever watched, and I’m so happy that you’re happy Jacob! You love to see it.
I feel bad for your bank…….and your wallet
5:25 Surprised me to see Poppy Playtime there
11:14 ur welcome
Whats the song at 20:56?
More like Alphachad. What a sweet dude
This was so much more wholesome than I expected. T^T
How did this go from "haha look at funny man spending way too much money" to incredibly heartfelt so fast 🥺
Shoutout to that one time that he bullied jaiden for buying too many pokemon plushes!
Australian McDonald's at the top of your tier list, based!
Pokémom made a profit by inviting alpharad.
sweet vid
11:10 what car is that it looks cool af 12:45 damn that miku statue is amazing  15:36 goddamn. 21:37 LMAOOOO  the chopper one is good too... 25:20 good job dotcolin
you are the best bro i love you
I know you talked about not being happy for a while and I just wanna say thank you Jacob for sharing that and taking the time to be selfish and think about yourself, you truly are an icon in this space and inspire myself and millions around the world every time you post. I couldn't help but tear up watching your friends open their gifts from you, it was by far one of the nicest gestures I've seen and you can tell by their reactions that they didn't expect it but are overjoyed by their gifts. So once again thank you Jacob and Everyone on the alpharad team for continuing to make awesome stuff. One day I'd love to meet you so I can thank you in person.
sanjirad
Day 4 hit different 🤨
As someone who knows Pokemon made 12 billion$ this year and has a 120 billion$ net worth, the fact they had a convention sized pop up store with exclusives only is no shock.
This went an unexpected direction. Oh, my heart   💙
Glad to see Jaiden got a bigger Joltik
I saw you kiss that dude
Loving the jaiden jumpscares
So we not gonna talk about whats happening at 11:14 there are we Alpharad 😏
HATSUNE MIKUUU!!!!!
Woulda been a lot cooler if you didn’t ask all your friends to record themselves opening your gifts for content
Why do I get the feeling that Jacob learned something about himself at Night 4 Karaoke?
Straight up jjk manga flashbacks when he said Shibuya
Hearing you say that you were happy brought the biggest smile to my face. I am so glad that someone who helped me laugh through some of my toughest times was able to overcome their own. Keep being yourself because god knows so many people love that person🙂
1:21 this man is like me you should go to Columbia and try their kfc there i think it was better than what they had in America
Did no one notice that he kissed a dude at 11:14
at 11:14 whats going on
15:31 Random Connor is random, but i did see a clip of him mentioning touring Alpharad
I don't cry much (at all), but hearing Jacob talk about how happy he is with his life and then seeing how happy his friends were with their gifts a few minutes later made me tear up. It was genuinely one of the most wholesome things I've ever seen
So when exactly is Ace of Hearts coming back???
What did he get pointcrow??
The end of the video made me cry!! It’s so special to do something selfless for the people that you love 💜  Even better that there were so many people i’ve gotten to know and become friends with through smash and working events!! Biiiiig Keely, Jome, Bobby and Jo fan tbh ❤  Thank u for the wonderful video :3
How bad is American food? I've had Japanese expats come to my country and say they like the food in here more than japan😅  Also one piece 1072 let's gooo
Thank you for acknowledging how awkward it is that worlds is gonna be in Hawaii next year
1:30 the rare Norway L I'm glad that the video that is sponsored by Pokemon also has a gay kiss. Is Alpharad Pokemon's first confirmed gay character? No. The answer is no. He is not a character. Also his orientation is a bit more complicated than gay but like, there isn't a masculine version of Sapphic that's super accepted off the top of my head. Achillic? 5:25 This Huggy Wuggy merch is so sad to see, I hate that design so much and then they put those 3 letters on it. 8:02 AWWWW I LOVE THEIR UNIQUE CHARM!!! WAIT I DID *NOT* REALIZE THE FULL CONTEXT OF THE FAILBOAT THING, THIS IS INSANELY EMOTIONAL AAAAAGH THIS IS SUCH A GOOD VIDEO djwaofdjoifjsofiosjioe CAN'T BELIEVE I ALMOST SKIPPED IT nfesfsiofjiosfe
I am so fucking glad I can call this man my favorite content creator
Alpharad would make a great transformers fan
This video's ending is the perfect example for why Alpharad is probably my biggest inspiration and sources of confidences in doing  youtube. He constantly proves it doesn't have to be about the popularity or money, sometimes the friends you make are more important and are great motivator to stay sane and happy. Even if that isn't really the exact message he wanted to spread, that is what I took from it and warms my heart.
This video really feels like something special that I will continue to watch all the way through every once in a while just because it really hits in the feels. You are an incredible content creator, and I'm glad to hear you're doing well, and I'm glad to he along for the ride
Alpharad just had the post-millionaire clarity moment.
Its absurd to me that this man spent 17k on merch in another country, brought it home, and plottwist he went "Oh by the way these are all souvenirs for my friends (: " Like holy shit, thats insane. Quality video, thank you for showing us how it went there, and i hope that you continue to work on Youtube, but more so, take the time to be alone as well as with friends and family. Absolute Legend.
Jacob's wallet will never recover from this.
Probably one of my favorite videos of all time
This video had me on a whole roller coaster of emotions which I didn’t expect. Glad you’re happy Jacob, I hope to achieve that kind of happiness someday!
i started crying waterfalls at the end
Wow. This video was beautiful.😭😊
Honestly he's just so wholesome and funny and real, Jacob keep going! You're a inspiration to everyone around you and appreciate all your efforts
I like how he just sends Smallant a bunch of what is probably porn XD
I remember distinctly watching on my phone, refreshing YouTube every second, to watch you hit a million subs. I have almost no YouTuber merch, but I do have your desk mouse pad thing and youtooz. I’m not a diehard fan of everything you make, but the way you’re so earnestly creative and up front with how you feel about it has been an inspiring journey of growth. Pop off Alpharad. So glad you feel so happy :)
Who this mf kissin at 11:14😂😂😂😂
this had me crying. been following since i saw like the seventh how to play 101 posted on reddit, and i've watched nearly every vid since then. thanks for the years of great content
This was such a wholesome video. I'm honestly so happy seeing you enjoy yourself and still think of your friends (and about how many suitcases you now own)
I resonate so hard with the end of the video. I took a trip to germany a few years back and spent like 400+ total on gifts for friends and family and got myself a cool lighter and like 1 pokemon pack.
Never thought an alpharad video would radiate such feel good energy. It hurts to smile this much. Thank you for this Jacob, but also, damn you for making my face sore!
11:14 Your Welcome
OH MY GOD. ALPHA. I AM. SO JEALOUS AND ALSO 🫡 TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT It’s so damn sweet you got all that for your friends, you’re awesome man
cancer is after you  watch out
As an Aussie, McDonalds sucks in Australia
Giving back to my friends is genuinely one of my biggest goals in life and it makes me so happy to see Jacob was able to do it to his friends.
i hope you bought the bulborb coin purse
You are and always will be someone who puts a smile on my face alphrad your so kind and hilarious and yet so cool and ive always enjoyed your content
I love you and your content so much, Jacob. I remember watching you when you when you were doing the original "How to Smash" character videos and I thought I wanted to be just like you and that hasn't changed over all these years.
11:20 😳🫢
11:14 AYO WTF
6:15 so we all agree Jan and Jacob totally hooked up right?
"they fed us a lot like thats a lot of food" bro forgot hes american
Jan Jacob kiss at 11:14 ❤
Jump Shop looks amazing 😍
Heh sounds like me hmmmmmmm debt yesssss
Only one question remains: What did Jacob send Pointcrow?
Jacob im so happy for you man and glad that life has led you to this point in your life where you are really happy. God bless you man
Bro if I was called Sanji by a random kid, that would probably be one of the best parts of my trip
based 11:14 on god🙏🙏
Alpharads accountant hates him and his friends love him for it. All right with the world.
What a beautiful video. It's all I gotta say. I'm subscribing to not be cringe. ❤
11:14 for Jacob and Jan kissing btw
All I gotta say is, the enemies to lovers arc between Jan and Jacob goes hard
AAAAYYYOOOO WHO DUH HEEEEEEELL YOU KISSING
After finishing this video, all I need to say is that you deserve everything good you get out of this channel/life, I’m glad that finally after years and years you are able to see the fruition of everything you’ve worked for since I started watching you. Here’s to hoping that something soon will give you this satisfaction
what the hell did you Send Eric
Trying fast food chains in other countries is actually good idea. Most of them out best the original US version.
Jacob get mistaken for Sanji, my dad if he wears red gets mistaken for Santa. this has happened 5 times to him, particularly when we go shopping
11:14  Ayo?🤨
11:14 We all saw that, Jacob...and Jan...kissing men?! He just like me fr fr 😎🤝😎
<3
It's official, protect this man at all cost!
I remember when my uncle decided to take a trip to Japan, and I think he had a great time. He brought back some cool souvenirs, like different flavored-kit kats, some t-shirts, and he even got me a Dratini plush from the Pokémon Center. I’m glad you were able to enjoy the experience like he did, Jacob
I can confirm Shibuya is the place to spend money. I spent around $200 there myself.
This was an awesome video both in humor and emotion. It was really awesome to see all the friends you made so happy in the end and I’m glad that you’re enjoying your life too!
11:14 confirmed
I had the biggest smile plastered on my face for the entire last 5 minutes of this video. So wholesome.
So I didn't know that that Ariel figure even existed, so when he showed it in the video, I kid you not, I literally paused the video, bought one myself, and then continued watching.  I may like Ariel a little bit.  EDIT:  I just realized I did the thing where I post a comment before finishing the video.  Also Jacob giving all that stuff to their friends was an insanely kind thing to do.  Mad respect.
7:22 When I saw the INSANELY high price of this purchase and then realized that there were still 20 minutes left in the video, I knew I was in for an amazing ride.
"It's also hard to realize that the things that feel like they don't matter do,  if they make you happy" - Alpha  That was a quote I needed right now, it was an answer to my prayer. Its great to see a better side of Youtube about real messages of realizing what brings you joy in this life. Everyone has their own path to travel and hardship. I feel I don't have much to relate to people near me and I get criticized for things I love. I know that in the grand scheme of things you have joy from having what makes you happy in your life. Thank you Alpha for this video and I am glad you were able to go on a vacation and that it brought you joy. :)
This man really trying to squeeze in that split second between 11:14 - 11:15
Almost brought me to tears, man. Excellent video
Bro but everyone saw him kiss Jan, right?!
Nintendo fr took all of the biggest pokemon fans in the world into a store of limited edition Pokemon merch they knew what they were doing
6:16 Holy shit! Is Jan super tall or are those girls super short?
jacob your such a good person im so glad you found happiness and i hope you never loose it keep making such amazing videos and me and all your other fans love you 💙💙💙
Do anyone gonna talk about 11:14 ?? (Pause when he starts saying day 5)
write it all off as a business expense it's for the video it's justifiable
wow
Banger video, the end had me grinning like crazy
Bro is rich rich
you do look sanji
Hold up alpha is one of those gay ppl
This is heaven on earth
This may sound really dumb, but I want to be able to spread happiness to as many people as I can, like you did. You honestly inspired me to try to be someone that makes others days better (wether that was on purpose or not it happened) I’m really proud of you for finding the joy in life and spreading it to those who matter to you (I know me being proud probably means not much but I still wanted to let you know)
This video made me happy. My heart melted watching all of your friends get super excited with the merch you got them.
Is alpha bi?
HOLY SHIT! this was so fucking wholesome!
Giving his friends all the gifts has cemented Alphard as my favorite YouTuber
This video has given me the biggest smile I've ever gotten from any video ever
So all you’re saying is get sponsored by Pokémon Company and indulge in the finesse and beauty of overseas 💀
Alpharad needed this so much
"oh my God I love her" during the add read aka not beating the furry allegations
Jan and jacob kissing was traumatic
You ever watch something and think it's super cool and then the absolute sadness that is your life sets in because you don't make enough to ever do stuff like this?
ayyyyyyyyyye just got back from a 2 week trip with my 2 best friends myself. saw the one piece statues in kumamoto, saw a hastune miku magical mirai concert, saw a concert of my favorite band Tricot, went to the Itsukushima Shrine the giant tori gate in the water, went to another island called rabbit island where there were rabbits EVERYWHERE. did a massive tower slider thing in osaka and spent a ton of time at arcades and such in kyoto! Japan is amazing!!!
Who's the vtuber who got all the one piece stuff? 21:47
This guy spent what would take me about 2 months of straight working to get, all on his friends, that shits mad inspiring, hell yeah
I loved this video with all of the trips and hardships, and seeing yourself realise, that you love doing this and your friends that helped you. This actually made me cry I am soo happy for you.
The end of this video made me tear up with happiness. It's really cool to see you doing well
That is so beautiful and wholesome. I love it!
I'm so happy to see you being happy Alpha. You basically kept me going during some of the hardest moments of my life. I love not just your content but what you've done for me, creatively, enjoyment wise and more. I know you don't read every comment, but I just need to tell you. Thank you so so much❤
Sorry, I'm already cringe.  Er, wait, Subscribed. Nobbers Well, cringe too, but like, subscribed also, y'know? You know.
Its okay. Influencers don't deserve to be happy.
What a beautiful, sponsored kiss
It seems so hard to play video games for a living and still making more than most people.
I too hate my wallet
I had such a big smile on my face seeing all your friends unwrap their gifts because half of them I practically grew up with. I won't deny I would've done the exact same thing, even if they had the smallest impact on my life. I love all my friends.
He brought pchal with him? Oh hell nah this is a PROOF we're getting soullocke 2
soo are we gonna talk about what happened at 11:14 LOL
“Zoom in the camera. I dont know how”
11:14 this goes harder than eminem
ahh yes but can you get high and go skeet shooting of a skyscraper in Japan?
That montage at the end had me smiling ear to ear. Kindness goes a long way folks. :)
end of the video got me cryin in da club boi
I remember watching Alpharad cook Ramen years ago, what a ride its been!
11:14 Finally <3
2:38 Persona 4 music fuck yeah!
hold up, set playback speed to .25 scrub to 11:14 and find the best part of the video
11:14 if this is a pokemon-sponsored video does that mean the pokemon company officialy approves of yaoi. a great day.
5:25 STD?
Tip for your next internation shopping spree: vaccume bags. Suck all the air out of them plushies to save on space.
I love how the thumbnail shows Luffy and Straw Hats walking happily in one direction, and Zoro wandering in other direction. Love the attention to detail and the One Piece humour. 😂
This was so cute and good, I was in tears. I'm so glad you're doing well, and it really shows. You're doing great, and we're so proud of you. Thank you for everything
11:14  well that was unexpected  1:31 LETS GO AUSTRALIA FOR THE WIN
WE LOVE JACOB!! WE LOVE JACOB!! WE LOVE JACOB!!
Ran into you and Jaiden in Shibuya during the One Piece Card event, really chill dude. Glad you had fun!
Alpharad is literally the main protag who talks about how what really mattered was the friends made along the way ❤
bro said cool mermaid figure
All the money was worth it. 20:56
The compilation of all your friends getting your gifts made me very emotional. Thank you
9:56 The Bronze Jade jumpscare (WARNING: SCARY 😟😟💀)
Hey guys. Coming from Alpharad Gold. Can someone time stamp the kiss frame please? Thanks! 🙏
Alpha, ur just awesome!
How much was it total?
Wow al this is amazing I think we all want u to be happy and feel good we can wait for a video bro take a bubble bath we all love u
Thanks for all the gifts brother, love ya.  I was sweating on stream with how many One Piece spoilers were in that box tho LMAO
Surprised no one mentioned Alpha x PCal yet—  11:14   (Your welcome)
Kinda surprised this happened, TPCs sorta known for cutting ties with content creators for playing romhacks as simple as randomizers, which Alpha has done on the channel and in streams plenty of times. Wonder if they're letting up on that now.
Love the give back to those who helped you out. Just wish I could look at that price and not cry how ot was more than I made last year total
0:41 Hatsune Miku! Also, I'm excited for the next song for Project Voltage!
Started watching this just to have something to watch, quickly became enthralled by the travel vlog. Despite the cries for help coming from your wallet, you can tell you were having a blast. Then it really felt nice to hear you say that you're happy with life, and where you are in it. Then I was practically in tears seeing how thoughtful you were with all of your best friends. All and all, this video really made my heart smile, and I'm so happy for all of you.
thank you for making my furry dream come true, Jacob x Jan kissing at 11:14. THANK YOU.
wholesome content creator. <3 u mr Rad. <3 u fellow Chat members
Thank you, Mr. YouTube Man Alpharad, for being an amazing person. I'm happy and proud to say you're my favorite YouTuber
I know, this whole video was so emotionally charged, and it was just so good, but I must know  *cocks gun*  Where’s the crane game video vs CDawgVA mr alpharad?
Looks like karaoke night got interesting for one frame lol
2:46 no-one gonna mention that? Anyone? Cause that was a bit out of pocket.
If you came here from the alpharad gold video, it’s 11:13
Alright, alright. You’ve finally done it. I’m finally subscribing. Gosh I was not prepared for the end of this video.
Why was the best content the content when Jacob is just enjoying himself Instead of being alpharad and trying to get content even by ruining his own life. we can just see Jacob be happy
19:37 THE ALPHARASS HOLY GYATT
stay happy alpharad keep on being you
You should be on CDawg's claw machine series
This is the best video so far! ❤❤❤
I love how iron valiant's new card basically confirms it's blades are made of lasers
11:14 bruh
Fuck yeah, Aussie Maccas on top of the McDonald’s tier list, I could not be more proud of my country
Commenting it early bc it bothered me. That was a great clay magnemite imo! The only thing aside from smoothness it didn't have next to the official (which I'm guessing was eihter done by close attention before firing, sanding, or glaze layer) was different screw construction. The rest was quality!
Ngl dude if i had that kind of cash to throw around i would legit have to buy a dozen suitcases. Either that or get it all shipped back to the EU. Imagine tons of manga, gunpla and random merch.
Video ended in the best way ever
This video gave me all the feels, since I also took 3 weeks in Japan this august as my first vacation since doing a PhD. Very glad to see another human so happy
11:14 for the kiss
pchal so cute omg
Da king is back baby he neva miss
I lived in Japan for 5 years while I was in the Navy. 7 eleven was our go to for everything
colin getting kid in car followed by altrive getting baby in car had me rolling lmao
this is honestly one of the most wholesome videos ive ever seen. the fact that you spent so much of your savings on your friends shows how much you care <3 you've earned it buddy oomfie scrunkly
Teardrop as the emotion script dropped. Have a small channel with 20k sub. Which may be very insignificant compare to Jacob. But what he tried to say is so much
11:14 SIR?!?!?!
that was not the video I expected, but it was really sweet.  Looking forward to whatever comes next JakobAlpharad (Hoping for the part 2 of TwitchPlaysPokemon personally)
what did failboat get, i saw him at the start of the friend gift montage but not after that
I'm glad you're happy Alpharad!
This was so so so so precious
4:23 anyone seeing this as famous last words or nah
Dad's first mic intro at the end scared the heck out of me lmao
alparad is smash
Genuinely this is your best video yet. Thank you for being you and inspiring so many of us to aim higher 💞
I've been a fan since HTP Villager And this easily has to be my favorite video you've ever made Best wishes Alpharad! May you continue to enjoy your time with your friends, and hopefully be proud of your work that I can assure you has given many people a good laugh and happy hearts!
We love YOUR SILLY LIL IRL SHENANIGANS!!! Viral don’t matter as long as we get Jacob at his most happiest. That’s how I feel personally
Bro should of given me something >:/ but seriously this is such a cute video!!!!
Jacob’s videos are ADHD bait. I can’t stop watching
Seeing everyone open their gifts made me tear up a bit :,)
jackob best waifu
Alpharad… you are an absolute inspiration. It’s crazy to see how far you have came, but all of us are so extremely proud of you. I would say hope you loved you trip, but come on, we all know you already did
Can't believe I got spoiled on One Piece from one panel in an Alpharad video T_T
That part of the video about happiness was really like- inspirational, and that last part was so sweet. Showing what’s important dude, happiness and the people you cherish. 🤙
my condolences but the sanji bit was fuckin phenomenal, the visual of a small japanese child seeing a blond man for the first time in his life and immediately thinking "holy shit, sanji irl" has me in stitches
I just want to point out that 7-11 is just as good in the US. I'm a nursing student who wants to become a FNP and I'm deeply interested and involved in nutrition. Most US cities are considered a food desert, and 7-11 is often the only resource for affordable food diversity
God this whole thing is so sweet and I love every part of this
Pokémon challenges go crazy when drunk
11:14 Mood
I’m super glad you’re happy. That’s even better than everything else I’ve said.
One of my favorite creators through the years, so glad to see you've found a good place in your life. I myself am kind of struggling and hearing that you're doing good and seem so passionate makes me feel a little less hopeless about the future. Hope this great streak of your life (and your content) continues for a long time
Zoro got so lost in the thumbnail, the Forgers had to adopt him.
Always knew Jacob was just a tsundere for Jan.
Happy almost decade I guess
wow sanji-san, that's.. alot of pokemon plushies, where are you gonna keep them
THE ONE FRAME OF YOU AND POKEMON CHALLENGES????  Enemy to lovers arc complete.
Hi Jo
I forget if most of the stores in Japan can ship the merchandise to other countries too. I would love to go to most of these stores, between dealing with work and time. Good grief
I love Australia is S tier 🤣
You must've enjoyed yourself at that karaoke
tomato
Lol the Pokémon company targeted you and your friends as high rollers. Like employees rewarding excessive spending in a casino. 😂
I don't think a YouTube video has ever made me this emotional, and this is as someone who's been watching the site since its inception and your content for about half the time you've been creating it. The first half was entertaining, of course, but learning about the mental struggles that you've faced, seeing you be so down-to-earth about your life and the progression of what it's meant to you, it all... I don't know, hit really close to home for me, because as someone who's looking at getting into content creation, I feel like it's really important to know about the baseline of what someone can go through on the extremes of the creator life. Listening to you describe your recovery from such a dark place with such genuine catharsis was, on many levels, a relief of the highest order, because on a lesser scale I feel a lot of the things that you described, and looking at the way you've used the simple things of real life to patch up the holes in both your own health and your relationships, I have a new lease on the idea of improving myself in the same ways. And then looking at what you spent this entire video building up to, the combination of loving abandon and meticulous forethought with which you showered your friends and how definitively it shone through you didn't care about the price tag so long as everyone you cared about was happy... Your journey as a creator and as a person is so far from over, and I look up to you perhaps most out of any creator I've ever witnessed and can't wait to see where you go from here.    Just remember to send your accountant some stuff as well ;)
Its 9am and I'm watching Alpharad talk about being happy and then transitioning to show how much he loves his friends and now its 9:15am and I'm crying actually crying
I'll be honest, I started getting teary eyed at the end there. That was such an amazing thing to do for your friends and it shows not only how much you care about them but also how well you know them. I honestly feel like that made my day just seeing that happen
Genuinely you have the kindest soul, you’re definitely on the top 10 list of realest YouTubers along with Ludwig, jaiden animations and captain sparkles, if anyone’s gonna inspire another person it’s gonna be you homie
what a video
You did it, you somehow made unhinged consumerism into a wholesome video.
Welp, you did it, this video has made me cry. No words can describe how proud and happy I am hearing you say you are happy and how much you value your relationships. Especially as someone who is having such a tough time starting my second year of uni and about to start dabbling into content creation after years of hesitation, the second half made me smile so big. I don't know many people at the moment but i can only strive to become such an impactful friend as you are to yours and them to you. This broke me, it showed me what I yearned for and how fufilling it looks and seeing you talk about it just inspires me. If you ever read this, all I can say is thank you and I wish you the best.
I recently went to Japan and found the 7-eleven part sooooooo relatable!!
it's amazing you can spend that much money after a divorce
1:44 guess you didnt see what prozd did first when he arrived in toronto
That ending brought such a level of joy I was not expecting
The ending I loved more than I expected. Did something similar for a friend of mine. Took months and some overtime to order, but the joy he had and look on his face. I loved giving back to my best supporter
This video really makes me wish I had money and/or friends lol
Wow, after finishing this video I wonder what Jacob’s love language is lol
I’m glad you fine and happy. I’m also thankful to your friends for keep supporting you. You and your friends deserve it ❤.
yo what is that kingdom hearts theme at 16:24. shit goes HARD
Alpharad deserved this vacation to Japan 💯🙏🏼
IS THAT CONNOR DAWG VIRGINA I SPY???
That was so sweet at the end!❤❤❤❤
I dont really comment but man you're a good person be happy with what you do
holy shit i was not expecting an ohara cameo in this video
thx ,have fun, keep on living please
Thank you for sharing your story it was just what I needed to hear. I came thinking funny pokemon content and got so much more.
This shows that Alpharad can make his friends day get more better than ever with his surprises and all that, which makes him one of the best content creators to exist
At this point you could tell me you could purchase replacement organs and get the surgery at 7/11 in Japan and I wouldn’t even bat an eye.
Get you a friend like Jacob that remembers the little things and surprises you with them later on.
i have never felt more jealous of a random youtuber in my entire life
So no ones gonna talk about 11:14
11:14 go frame by frame
Sonic Adventure 2 video coming soon?? 🥹
Bro is in the negitives
24:06 bro I want that backpack 😭🥲
11:14 WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST SAW JACOB ALPHARAD Btw cool trip and cool vid, hope your wallet recovers
Self care seems to be a major thing YouTubers seem to learn later on in their careers I notice. Take a week or two break if you feel you must every 6 months. Go out somewhere different. I'll be honest I'm a city guy who would like to sit on my laptop all day and voice with friends or game all the time. But my favorite place to vacation is Wyoming. Teton Village or just across the boarder into Idaho. A change of scenery is pleasant for me even if I'm not one to go hike and will be on my laptop as well. But sometimes it's nice to set that down and walk out on the deck and take in fresh air. Remembering there are things called Trees and Grass out there XD.
Damn, you've come so far I'm happy for you Sanji
11:14 NICE!
so my new goal in life is to get a pokemon sponsored tour of japan with other pokemon fans
11:14 I saw that
Alpha, you had an egg burger. You had the double big Mac. But did you have the Samurai Mac???
I would have cried if a kid thought I was an anime character.  Also Jacob I haven't been a fan for long. I actually didn't know about your channel until I met my boyfriend 4 years ago. Even in this 4 years I've seen your growth. I'm so happy to see you love your friends and I'm so happy to see you love yourself too. Continue to grow and continue to be happy.   Thank you for you content 🩷
Jan jumpscare
He didn't give the Wooper to Smallant. The entire wholesome moment is now invalid
This is too good
11:14 love wins!
Ayo @11:14 !?
I won't lie i had a smile on my face watching this. You have come so far as a content creator and you inspire me to make stuff that people enjoy. I am glad you were able to turn your brain off and enjoy yourself
My god this video is so wholesome, this just shows how an incredible friend and person you are, you deserve everything and more you have worked on this platform.
probably my favorite video you've ever made, you're awesome
God just watching this entire video, you can tell that not only is he enjoying his vacation to the fullest, but he's also thought of every single one of his friends that have supported him through the years. And honestly? He deserves it. 100%.
ULTRAMAN 2:43
SMITH LOOKS SO HAPPY
I dont comment ever on yt and ill keep it short been watching you since silly smash ultimate but speaking and gifts made tear up am happy for you
You’re such a beautiful soul. That was absolutely wonderful of you to gift your friends so thoughtfully.
Banger vid, I need a life changing trip to Japan
If I'm gonna put my thoughts in this overflowing comments section, your message to us makes sense, and I'm glad you got to have this wonderful time even if you are a "millionaire youtuber" 😀
There is such a place as heaven.
Wooo
Listen alpha i love your videos keep up the amazing work hope you get to 10M soon i will always cheer 🎉 you on good luck and stay happy😊
Hmm, I think I’ve seen that crane game shop before. Might you have run into a dawg of some kind while you were in Japan?
The fact that he got actual genuine amazing gifts for his friend 😭 W friend
I went and I’m still jealous of you
wholesome
The ending part was amazing, this is one of ur best vids alpha
Sooooo Jacob, about you and Jan
Great to hear you enjoyed Macca's (Australian McDonalds) enough to make it S Teir lol
Biggest tax write off of your life
This guy just spent in 20 days what I need to stretch out for my 6 month stay. Honestly good for you Jacob.
Oh man, watching his friends open his gifts to them just....I needed that. I was feeling like crap today and this just put the biggest smile on my face and the warmest fuzzies in my chest.
It was so nice to see the last part of the video with the reaction of all your friends and how you really know their taste. I did something similar to my friend group for Christmas, so fun to see their reaction.
Honestly if you shave down to sanji's goatee and pencil in some curly brows you would pull off a sanji cosplay
So who spent more you or Jaiden?😂
Hey Mr. Rad. Random question, are you still the president of the Paulatina fan club?
Time to learn cooking and kickboxing, "Sanji-san"
I’m glad you’re finally at a place where you feel happy Jacob. I’m so glad I found you back in 2018 to see how much you’ve grown now. I love this channel and the contents it brings, the people I’ve discovered, and the memories I’ve made with my friends watching your videos.   Keep your head up high, Jacob. Don’t let your crown falls
Yo a wild Bobby sighting!?!?
11:13 wait what… lol
Good stuff man. You've worked hard to get where you are, and you definitely deserved a vacation to reset your brain.
1:30 as an Australian I have to say it's terrifying to know our McDonald's is "the best". Scared to imagine what other countries McDonald's is like cause I feel like ours is already awful 💀
I guess the lesson is dont leave alpharad alone to store?
It makes me happy knowing that Alpha enjoyed Japan as much as I did, and I loved every ventures he made! I was also in Yokohama around that time, but I think our anxiety would of not liked it if we met lol.
I've been watching you for about 6-7 years now Alpharad, and hearing your whole speech about doing what makes you happy and hearing you say that youre happy is amazing. Even as "just a number", watching you change and grow has been amazing and I bet all us fans are glad you're in a better place now than ever. Keep up the good shit!
This honestly feels like the embodiment of christmas joy in a video ✨
one piece
Aight so no one gon call him out for lying? He got 191 mons not all 200 i want my money back! But fr glad you enjoyed your trip alpha
Must be nice being rich...
am happy your happy
11:13 you are welcome
AUSTRALIAN MCDONALD'S STAYS WINNING!!
Thank you so much for these videos, Alpha! You're fantastic!
11:14 💖
dude i just Love Jacob Funny Man Alpharad
Norway McDonalds is cracked what are you on about
11:14 Noice
LETS GO ALPHARAD!!!
i dont think ive ever cried at any media before, ever, but for some reason that end of the video had me bawling. life is strange.
Protect this man at all costs, he is truly an international treasure.
The 7/11s in South Korea are sick as hell too, one of the things I miss the most about living there
I haven't been following since day 1, but I'm grateful for all your "silly little internet videos". Enjoy your life man!
mans has to cosplay as Sanji for the memes!
There are so much many colors
11:14 The joke's come full circle now lmfao
Ngl, the end of this video made me cry a lot! You’re such an amazing person Jacob and the fact you bought maybe half of that stuff for your friends is so thoughtful 🥹
11:14 the kiss
Bro I’m not even lying, I cried seeing all his friends receive his gifts, I am so happy for you Alpharad, I can’t even express it. I hope you continue being an amazing YouTuber. Stay gold ✌️
What a series of chapters and stories that was. There really is no one else like you, Alpharad. You have to be one of the most dedicated, thoughtful, and caring people the Internet has ever seen. I’m so glad to hear that you’re much happier now because you are more than deserving of it. Stay awesome. 💖💖💕💕💕💕
I almost cried at the end of the video, it was just so sweet. Ik its taboo when YouTubers talk about their personal lives but seeing alpharad grow over the past 4 years is truly an amazing thing to witness. And hearing him be happy and enjoy his life after knowing how long hes grinded out his youtube career truly warms my heart. Im so happy for you, i hope you continue to feel this happy
The ending of this put a tear in my eye.
Man the second half of the vid nearly made me cry, and then the clips of younger you just hit me with nostalgia. Especially the clip of the science museum song it just took me back. You’ve always just been a good guy for so long, thanks for the hard work for almost 9 years
It made me tear up how much a "Youtuber millionaire" really thinks about and cares about his friends, even while on a life changing vacation. True inspiration. Glad you're happy bro.
This is so incredibly sweet
Lol Alpharad x Pokémon Challenges 11:14
The Satisfaction of spending money you've been saving your entire life is nothing but godly.
Actually so heartwarming. Its been really fun to really grow up watching alpharad and seeing how the channel has progressed. I can’t wait until I have the opportunity to give back to some of the people who matter most to me in such a way that makes them feel as seen and thought of as the people featured at the end ❤
2:45 Please never change, Alpharad.
I've been subscribed to this channel since I was in 8th grade. All through my high school career, and up through today, I've watched every single Alpharad vid the day it came out. Looking back, I've had so much fun watching the escapades of the internet funnyman™, and I look forward to as many more videos as you want to make. Cheers!
I really wanna be like Alpharad one day. Where i've reached such a high point that I can go out and spend thousands on the people I care about most, who have given me all the support in the world. This is such a beautiful thing to see.
We're not gonna talk about karaoke night 🤭
I honestly think never a video made me so happy in a point of being smiling through it start to finish. You deserve the world, Jacob! Such an incredible content creator and a friend.
9:23 ROWLET LETS GO 24:57 MORE ROWLET LETS A GO 26:50 rowlet moment
Alpharad Sanji Cosplay for Halloween???
The kid thought you were sanji from one piece
You really thought nobody would notice 11:14? You sly dog
This video is a piece of art
Everybody talking about how sweet the video is, but no one is talking about jacob and jan making out for one frame at 11:13
We love you, Jacob! Me and others are super happy that you're happy!
so we're just gonna ignore 11:14 lmao
now that i think about it alpharad does kind of look like sanji from one piece
I went to japan this year as well, however me and my friends turned family mart into a cult following
You could give me your pokemone merch
just saying in aus we have a triple big mac
This whole video was absolutely incredible, but the montage of everyone taking out the Sitting Cuties of their favorite Pokémon actually started to make me tear up. Your "you don't know these people like I do!" from your YouTuber Egglocke really hits different now in the best way. I'm so glad you've got to build all this with all these people; I'm glad you're happy. And you've reminded me to try searching for my own happiness in life again.
This video hit so well for me emotionally. Hearing someone go through similar experiences, going from an extremely rough emotional spot in their life to finally going somewhere and doing something they've always dreamed of after finally getting better really brought me back when  I went through the exact same thing after my three year long battle with chemo and mental illness. I remember smiling and being just so happy the moment I walked into my first Pokemon center. I dropped quite a lot of my hard earned money but you sir defilement had me beat. Your videos helped me through some of those tough times. If you end up reading this, I just wanna say thanks :)
Heyo, I am planning on making YT videos and potentially livesteaming. Does anyone here have any tips on what to use to record videos?   Also shout out to my buddy @n3wb_deli Hes been popping off recently on videos and i hope whoever sees this comment supports him
Alpharad is sanji confirmed???
OMG IVE GOT THAT WOOPER
I had to pause during the video just to ask... did anyone see what happened at like 11:13 for a split second?? No? OK back to watching the video
What did gou give jaiden
@Alpharad Beautiful video. I haven’t had something touch me like this in a long time. It made me cry a lot but I’m happy that you’ve found so much happiness in your life. I wish nothing but the best for you
im not crying you are 0-0
It's really amazing seeing such a warm and lovable guy getting the happiness he deserves. The Alpharad channel has given me a lot of joy and a lot of laughs even tho I just recently found it, but Jacob has always managed to bring a smile to my face. He deserves the world
Invite meeeeeeeeee😭
Getting your friends to record the reactions to your gifts so you can have them be tax write offs is an outstanding move.  On another note. It's insane to see how far you've come from your How To Play days. You've grown so much and changed for the better in so many ways. Genuinely inspirational
what song is it at 16:24?
Man i can believe i cry seen this video haha, I'm so happy for you alpha. Hope the best for you and your friends
Thank you for sharing 😁 Alpharad
Wait ....did anyone else do a frame freeze on a particular scene?
How could you be so big and be so unhappy doing something you love? I'd do anything to get that talent and fame
nice.
I'm usually a lurker and never really comment ever but wow this was a phenomenal video. Good fucking job king
IM GOING TO FUCKING CRY
alphara needs his parenter to be financially amazing otherwise he is fucked later ;)
I loved when you talked about getting out more from YT. I've been doing YouTube for over half my life now and I'm almost 18, but have recently been stepping back to live life a little more.  It really is important to not let yourself get too caught up in it, glad that I'm not the only one that feels that! (Also BANGER VID!! I wanna go to Japan so bad)
The ending is amazing
Dude what a fun freakn video, thanks for all the continued top quality content. Was not expecting to feel shit in a Pokemon video today
Pointcrew got porno?
Love how Altrive got a random ass Foxy stamp card. Amazing  That being said, its crazy how long it really has been since I’ve started watching Alpha’s videos. Pretty sure my first video was the NOT SMASH video: a classic. Its been years, and I remember the post of him talking about how he felt about his content. It truly has been a crazy journey and I have absolutely loved it. These videos helped me through so much and I’m so glad to have found this channel years ago
This was actually really similar to my trip to Japan 9 years ago I plan in going again for the second time in 6 months  The only thing I didn’t like was how humid it can get but otherwise it’s an amazing country.
For the past 7-8ish years, Jacob has always had such a powerful impact on my childhood and it's been crazy to watch him grow as a person. This man deserves his flowers and definitely does not have the credit he deserves for how much effort and time he puts into everything he does. A genuine and honest man, if this is anyone's first time seeing Alpharad, definitely subscribe cause this man really makes sure he never disappoints. Thank you Jacob for making my childhood, I definitely wouldn't be the same person today if it weren't for you. I've watched tons of youtubers and have moved on from so many, but I really think you are the only youtuber who I've always been able to come back to. Thank you for all you've done Jacob and I personally can't wait to see where you go next. Thank you <3
As someone who lives in Hawaii haha….yeah that was ill timed LOL
I subbed because of this video.
this made me cry. you are so kind and thoughtful. that’s amazing. i subbed in 2020. it’s been amazing to watch since then.
Best ending of a video of all time
Dude, this so wholesome.
WAIT ALPHA YOU REALLY HAVE THE LOOK FOR IT, YOU SHOULD 100% DRESS AS TIME-SKIP SANJI ON HALLOWEEN
Love to hear a dude wax philosophical about ennui in the same 30 minute video where he humble-brags about dropping five grand on Pokemon dolls.
The fact that this video was released within a month of Alpharad playing a personally-commissioned hard-modded version of Emerald featuring Slugma the DeezNut type Pokemon sure is very something of The Pokemon Company to do.
"Pipe bomb, so cool..." 13:35 I guess they took the meme a bit too seriously.
Japan is really fun. I'm thinking of moving there when I grow up (I'm half-japanese and kinda fluent so it's pretty possible.)
Did not expect alpha the rad to make alpha the ....ball my fucking eyes out  Hope you enjoyed your trip!
I cried at the wholesomeness wow
This has got to be one of the best Alpharad uploads ever, hearing about your happiness and health and just how grateful you are for your fiends legit almost made me cry. Thank You Alpha
what it smell like?
i'm glad i helped minimize the damage done to his wallet
Pokemon sponsoring alpharad is...not something i expected
I am so glad to hear that you've been doing doing so much with your friends recently. I have been really enjoying all the "out in the world" videos you've had recently. I can truly say I think no matter what you do, I'll enjoy seeing you have fun with it.
i think this is like everyones dream, to get a sponsored trip to japan with all your friends also holy shit spending that much money on all your friends sounds amazing and we definitely made the right person famous lmao
At first I watched this being like "classic Alpharad video" but then when you talked about how it was a way for you to get a better perspective, get that vacation and overall say that YOU are happy....honestly made me smile like a dork, everyone deserves to be happy and I'm glad you can say that Jacob, not only that the fact you spent so much money only to gift some of it back to your friends is just honestly just the icing on this cake.  Glad you had fun and I'm happy for you! <3
You should tell Pokemon to ban all the cheaters. Oh wait, your friends like Wolfy is a cheater isint he.
Omg the Connor cameo?! Trash taste appearance when?
The wise words from a funny man
I love how everybody got these wholesome gifts and then pointcrow got porn
15:32 cdawgva spotted
I honestly wanted to see ALL what Alpharad bought XD
I am coping, seething, and malding.
Yeah i Saw that french kiss with pokemonchallenges at 11:14, cant fool me 😎
idk who that was dancing at 6:47 but they were the most adorable i ever saw, glad they are having a good time!  also jaiden looks like that awkward gf that is just there to give emotional support even if they dont like the stuff (which gladly isnt the case)  also, even if your youtube was sucessful and were able to make good money and all, your struggles are yours and are valid, even if you are sucessful or wealthy your struggles are still humans and i kinda understand, tho in the other end of the scale   tbh today was one of the worst days of my life, i was really close to make something really bad to myself, and seeing this and the end just brings a tear to my eyes, i never really watched alpharad much, he always remembered me a lot of myself and i didnt liked to see stuff that were like watching myself all the time,  but i am so proud of him, its like he did our dream of finally going to japan, seeing so much, being the kleptomaniac we are for merch and random stuff we like, and at the end bringing so many gifts to the friends he has (cant relate cant make friends, maybe autism or idk)  it feels like i see him as me  from another end, maybe that would have happened too if i didnt stop after starting all 11 or so years ago on my other account and getting bullied at school, alpharad is a strong guy that deserve all he got and i hope more good things come to him even after not being around!
Hey jacob, idk if you’ll see this message but i would like to say ive been watching you for nearly 7 years now. Found you in elementary and now im about to head to college. Crazy how you have impacted my life and how much i enjoy your content. Truly appreciate you so much regardless if you see this comment or not. Ive loved watching you for years i remember my first every video being the sun and moon supercut. Was absolutely hooked from there on and im glad to have stayed throughout the whole journey.
You are genuinely one of the best youtubers I have found. Your content is is always amazing and all your fans love you. Keep it up
11:14 You can come out
love you, alpharad :) your videos have made me smile and I apreciate everything you've done for all of us viewers!!
This video, this whole outro sequence with every one of your friends, it makes me wish I could subscribe to this channel all over again, like I did five years ago.
Hey Jacob, long time viewer here. I know that this is kind of weird to say, but I really appreciate your honesty about your mental health in this video. It makes me realize that even people I idolize are also struggling with a lot of things, and I just wanna say thank you so much for your sacrifice. This channel has grounded me and taught me so much about life, which is interesting to realize when half of your vids are about a funny fighting game, but you are giving me hope for my little life. A lot changed for me recently, a lot of discomfort but also wonders, but this channel keeps on reminding me who I am. Every viewer on your videos is also struggling with something. Sometimes smaller, sometimes bigger things, and I think that is beautiful.
I've been here since before 200k, and to say i'm proud of your growth would be an understatement. It's kind of funny too, as this past year i've also learned to truly be happy and love myself. Keep on living your life to the fullest man ❤
I'm glad you're doing well, both professionally and emotionally. Keep up the good work at your pace.
How to play 101 Alphard wouldn't believe it if we told him pokemon would fly him to Japan in the future
16:38 am i the only one that thinks he looks like mr beast
I'm cracking up at alpha being in awe at convenience stores.
i was like yeah sure another video of someone going to japan buying all the merch.. but the twist at the end?? incredible! thank you alpharad! you're the best 👏🏼✨
That compilation of people opening stuff is so sweet
Alpharad is too kind
Things I learned about Japan:   Japan = Fortnite
What did Alpha get pointcrow?
the Persona music is very fitting for the video
hate to break it to you mr alpharad but you used a chinese font for your japanese text so it looks a little off.  you only had weeks there to figure out what japanese looks like so I can't fault you too much
Japan being S tier McDonalds is wild to me. And that add read was smoooooooth.  P.S. After watching the whole video... damn, the ending hit me in the feels. <3
dont think we missed that makeout sesh during the blackout karaoke 👀🤣
11:14  Where the footage alpha? WHERE IS IT?!
Jacob just paying back the happiness his friends have given him. What a real one
14:37 they was trying to do the calcs to determine what is behind the prize cards.
i'm impressed that the ending blew out the entire fact that jacob was just making out with pokemon challenges at 11:14 lol
When I first saw all his instagram stories I thought “this man is gonna go broke 10 times” and now that I learned that Pokémon sponsored this whole thing, I know that THEYRE gonna go broke 10 times over
You now about castle crashers 😮
Alpharad, one of the few YouTubers capable of flexing wealth without looking like an asshole.
I can’t believe you spent near 20000 dollars on merch in the span of like 3 weeks.  Honestly I’m impressed and respect the dedication.
I'm one of your newer subscribers, only started following around March or so of this year. But you quickly became an inspiration, you're very friendly and look like you just do whatever you want to do. That's incredible, especially with the way YouTube works, and it's something I've been trying to get into this past decade with my own stuff. Going through a hard time myself, but I know with enough work and effort, and a focus on your own mental health, I'll get through it. Being sponsored by Pokemon and taking a trip to Japan (as costly as it was) is an absolute dream, and I'm glad you enjoyed it! Never lose yourself and everything will work out. :)
Manchild
WHO DID YOU KISS THIS TIME JACOB?! I SAW THOSE FEW FRAMES!
Ok that Anri shirt is just too cool
Hi Alpha
w alfa rad kissing another man 11:12
im sorry i know this video is very very wholesome not refuting that, but did everyone see alpha and jan booking it, its magical.
Everytime I watch an Alpharad video like this I get warm tingles
i watched this with a huge smile then boom makeout session that i didnt sign for but it was funny
Your castle crashers video was in the outro yippee
Oh, my goodness . . .
Words do not describe how happy this video makes me! Im glad you had a great time, and congrats on the Pokémon sponsorship!
Thank god you didn't went to shibuya october 31  (JJK Reference)
I bet Eric's box was filled with those 7/11 "romance" books 😂
So we all saw him and Jan making out right? Lol
I'm super grateful and proud to be part of Jacob's awesome community. Seriously, you deserve all the love, and thanks for putting in the hard work for 10 years. You're such a kind soul, spreading positivity to friends and the community. LOVE YOU, JACOB!
Going to a Magical Mirai is my DREAM!!!! I'm so glad you liked it. I'm going to Miku Expo in California this year but someday I'll go to Magical Mirai like you did :)
This video was beautiful and honestly felt like the culmination of everything you’ve given us as viewers, the sponsorship, the friendships, the love and passion for what you do and your love for communities, whether it’s you own, the Pokémon community, or your greater audience. That being said, are we not gonna talk about that karaoke moment?
So glad you enjoyed all of this, you sound so happy and fulfilled, real great you found a way to enjoy your life.    AHHH WHOLESOME
So glad to see that you're happy :3
Are we just gonna skip past alpha kissing a guy which not out of character but
9:56 why does he look like he's from Balan Wonderworld?
every last one of us if we ever go there, amirite?
1:31 Australian Mcdonalds is carried by the incident of '97
This is the sweetest video I have ever seen!
so are we gonna talk about 11:14?
Hey, thanks for the video, it’s a good one
The end was me pointing at the screen saying i know that person (a majority of these people were just voices before this video)
I went from being uber jealous of your awesome trip to Japan to gettin in my feels and bein happy for you..... so kudos i guess. I've been watching your vids for a good while now, and it's awesome to see you doin well.
I've seen hundreds, if not thousands, of Japan vlogs, but this was by far the best one I have ever seen. I am SO. HAPPY. you FINALLY got to visit Japan and had the time of your life. It was great to see you and a bunch of the homies enjoying Japan and all the awesome Japanese merch. I hope you visit Japan again and continue to have amazing times with friends there!!
Is anyone going to talk about that frame of Alpha making out with Pokemon Challenges (I think?) at 11:14?
This is so wholesome and I felt in my soul when he was talking about all the negative things he felt and broke my heart when I saw the gift giving vids
Great video as always!
All those smash huts paid off
"Unique"
Seeing all his friends getting the things made me so happy
Jacob, I’ve been following you since the start of your YouTube career and I got so emotional when you expressed how happy you are. You can really see it and I hope that light of yours never dies out. The way your friends got so excited over the gifts had me tearing up, that’s friendship goals right there. ❤
Alpha. I've first started watching you since your Pokémon Sword Supercut and I've been here ever since. You quickly became my number one favorite content creator and your videos and songs have gotten me through some incredibly tough times. When you said that you were finally happy, I swelled up with tears and they only kept coming until the end of the video. I know you've struggled with your own mental health and have pushed yourself to keep going for our sake so that you could be the Mr. Internet Funny Man for us, so hearing you say that you're genuinely happy brought me so much joy. You deserve all the success and happiness that comes to your life, and I'm thankful for all the laughter you've brought me. Thank you. 💙💛
tearing up at the end of the video. glad you’re happy, dude :)
they should have just paid you in a gift card
Cool guy buys cool friends cool lootboxes (colourized)
Well at least your not totally broke after that trip
I was so freaking confused when I went and 7eleven was like a top tier location
i went and spent over 5000+
this is one of the most amazing and wholesome videos ive ever seen.
Isn't this where we all wish we'd be in life? Getting sponsored to go have a vacation, have the best time of your life?
Alphas little magnemite just looks really happy :D
11:14 Eyo, run that by me again?
This is why Jacob Alpharad is the best youtuber on this platform rn! Hands down love every video!
We need a “best food I’ve ever had” counter
11:14
I have no idea what to say but I feel like I have to leave a comment after all this This video made me nearly cry, you are amazing Alpha, seeing how much fun u had in japan made me rly happy, what an amazing video, Ill be here to watch your videos and interact with them for a long time thats for sure
Y'know how YouTubers have video babies?? Yeah, this is Alpharads. 100%.
Why u gotta make us cry at the end there man
Really put the "Rad" in Alpharad.
I NEED that evangelion zippo
Oh you do look like sanji
I travelled to a different city in a different state just to buy anime figures, brought five empty suitcases and could barely fit everything so I feel ya.
i dont think the sponsorship will cover all the costs, but i think thats money well spent!
This is what it looks like to make it, Jacob's living his best life
Glad you found your way, for being someone who I often found comfort in.
The organized piles of goodies for each of his friends 🥹  The multiple people that said "how did he know I love this" 🥹🥹 Jacob you are a true Soft Boy in the best way. This video was so sweet, thank you for showing your genuine side for a moment
I was just smiling the last 10 minutes of the video
I'm not surprised there's Miku stuff there since she's very popular in Japan
I can’t believe YouTube recommended me to watch penguinz0 Biggest waste of Money Ever after this video.  In all seriousness, you are an incredible person Mr. Alpharad. This video is a great example of the true power of friendship. The fact that all of these other YouTubers as well as us the audience have gotten to join and watch your growth on this platform is truly inspiring. Keep on doing what makes you happy, and thank you for the years of laughs smiles and joys; to the internet funny man.
23:00 I'm going to cry 🥹
im i missing something or did he kiss a man at 11:14??? 🤣
Thank you for reminding me to do my Duolingo lesson I’ll be right back
This was so awesome and wholesome and made me so happy to watch ❤❤❤  We as your fans love you so much and i think i speak for everyone here when i say we are so proud of how far youve come. 2014 feels like ages ago. Glad i found you randomly in a smash 4 video where you said foward aerial a lot. Youve brought me personally a lot of years of joy and i really wanna say thank you for that.
11:13, wow just wow i knew my eyes didn't deceive me
A little kid mistaking you for an anime character has got to be one of the most adorable things I have ever heard.
I’m glad that your happy. Weather it’s McNuggets or friends happiness is important
11:14 based
I need that giant Joltik!
You may have a problem lol but glad u had fun!
Okay the ending literally brought me to tears. This is the most wholesome thing I can't even.
19:17 NOO you cannot put stickerbrush symphony right at the most emotional part of the video I will die of crying 😭
11:14 we all saw it Jacob, but no worries, we already knew it too
I would pay an unreasonable amount of money to see Jan sing karaoke.  That aside, this was a great video.
21:38 😂😂😂😂 frame it bro
Jan and Jacob is crazy☠️
I love your vids bro! Been here since maddawg in smash 101. Loved how u opened up, it helped me as well :)
This was the most wholesome Alpharad video.   I also now see why his friends keep falling for the Chris McLean episodes, you get a box from Alpharad there is a solid 70% chance it’s something really nice that shows how much he knows and values you, and not a smoke bomb after which you wake up in a content experiment, and I’d take those odds.
so wholesome.. i rly had to cry..
There’s something so heartwarming about seeing you buy 6 more suitcases to fill with gifts for your friends. You’re truly a gift to them Jacob!!
Odd question: Did you check out the car scene in Japan?
Got to love how America for some reason has low B tier near C tier McDonald’s.
I wish to be as successful as him I want to experience this too  Edit: I’m also scared to be unhappy in life but I think as long as you do things that keep you happy and you keep that passion you’ll be okay~.  18:45 I love the nudge at this but yesssss HES HAPPY!!!  I’ve been scared if this cuz I also want to maybe become a YouTuber/streamer I’m just scared of losing that passion and just become null and numb and void.  20:40 ALPHAAAAA bro at this point I’m just shocked, amazed even at how far he’s come, and finally speaking out about this being open and finally admitting that he’s happy and this to just cap it all of off, it’s amazing I’m in tears
Thank you for saying that Australian McDonalds is good. I had some like an hour ago.
Seeing that second half of the video brought me to tears and already having an emotional day this just hit the right spot of heart warning and fun and I liked seeing how open you were was great I am glad for you and hope you enjoy life too the fullest and thanks for all the good content
We love you alpha just keep your self happy you are awesome keep on going great ❤ wishing you the best 😊
Lil Asian boi said Sanji-san cuz u got blond hair and a beard which is exactly what he looks like in one piece... and not gonna lie... kid was right 😳
11:14 just threw me through a loop it went by so fast I had to pause and come back HOW DID NOBODY ELSE COMMENT ABOUT THIS.  Honestly, its probably just a bit, but ALSO knowing Jacob and Jan......................
Tea ceremonies are awesome (and the tea is honestly delicious)  ...Boy, that escalated quickly (I'm really happy for you)
I've been watching you for awhile. a long long while. 2014/2015 around that time. You've grown and changed so much and the fact that your given such amazing opperatunitys after working so hard. Im so happy and proud for you, Makes me tear up seeing the amazing life you've made for yourself and It must of felt so good to say "im happy" You deserve all you've gotten! I am so happy for you. And hopefully you get back all the money you spent broski that's more than I can count!
As a longtime fan, this was truly magical to watch.  I’m so glad you’re happy, man.
Ive been watching alpharad for years and seeing him genuinely happy and sharing it with his friends is honestly really heartwarming. Thank you for the great vids
Came for Japan, stayed for Therapy
Colin forgot the leaf transisitons
Man I just started making videos and this video is so inspiring. This helps motivate me to want to make more and more things because I know that I can get people to laugh and have a good time. Then after everything I can give back to everyone that has helped me become the person I am today and will continue to be. You've been a massive inspiration to me and I can only hope that this is a good thing for you to see. Though you don't know me I will continue to thank you again and again for being able to constantly put a smile on face and inspire me to do the exact same thing.
wasn't worlds an absolute shitshow nightmare for competitors? yeah IDC how many of my favorite youtubers they pay to promote their bullshit they can fuck off
I'm gonna be honest this video nearly made me cry twice it was just so amazing to see all of your friends so happy because of how well you know them and know that you're happy too. Thank you Jacob, for another amazing video.
nice balls
If your happy then its worth the world keep your mind healthy please
5:06 this will probably be the only time skylanders will ever be in an alpharad video and I WILL RELISH IN IT
wonder if they would of invited him if he was a stickler to never spending unless nessary. :P
i want to be a alpharad friend
15:10 Wait yeah wtf?! That doesn't make any sense 😂😂😂
🫂 Take a hug Alpharad. You need it.
11:14  nice.
Dawg where do i get the shirt youre wearing in the intro
19:30 i was NOT expecting to hear that song... i havnt heard that in years
I've been watching you for the past 4 years, watching every alpharad plus(delux, gold) video.. I'm so happy that you you actually feel Happy now:) wish you the best of luck!
im not crying, YOU'RE CRYING! SHUT UP!
I've been here for a few years and you know what I'm happy for you. And I hope you continue on your mental health and career
God damn, this video makes me want to meet you casually, have a drink with you in a one time encounter, knowing it'll be a great moment
Why tf are there no comments talking about the president timestamps
The second half really makes this one of my favorite vids, do whay makes ya happiest man :D
hello alpharad. I'm someone on the internet you've never heard of, but i wanted to send this comment out as a lil means of thanks i guess.  i wasn't expecting much more than what the title suggested, cool japan stuff, and you spending a lot. there might've been a lot of those things, yes, but that second half of the video was something special. i think everyone has had this dream of wanting to become a big youtube star, and i am no different.  but i always hesitated. never took the time to really sit down and work on big videos for people to consume and enjoy. i did it once and then never again. but the lil but very not lil talk you had about youtube, and how far you've come, and how one lil instance changed your entire outlook on the process, and how you took the time to talk about it and show the world what your thoughts were. it kinda shifted my view on everything.  there have been a lot of youtubers that have influenced what i wish to make, or when i want to make it, or how i want it to look, blah blah blah...  but you're the one person that might make me just... do it? y'know?  i've always had these thoughts and concepts for videos living in my head and i never acted on them, but after hearing and seeing what you did for you and your friends, it inspires me to act on them!  to put it simply. thank you, alpha. that one chat in the second half inspired me to do what i've always wanted to do. as you said it yourself, it's about time i "put myself forward" <3
That kid gonna remember meeting Sanji for the rest of his life
End of the video got me tearing up watching everyone geek out over everything they got, knowing how happy Jacob is now, and being able to tell how much he loves his friends and how much he wanted to share that happiness with his friends. You are truly a wonderful person, Jacob Alpharad. Thank you for these past 9 years that filled all of us with happiness and laughter. We're glad you can feel the way youve made us feel since watching your channel. We all appreciate you lots :) <3
man ive just been watching like youre a sensory video, but now im realizing its been like 7 years since i started watching. I remember the pokemon videos, smash bros, etc. honestly just speechless and im sure you are too
I should have seen that ending coming because he bought a CONSPICUOUSLY LARGE amount of merch.
I now really want to go to Japan
Its infuriating seeing first hand how much money Pokemon makes and then watching them deliver below average games like Scarlet and Violet. Glad you had fun though.
After all the brief asides that Jacob’s made about his mental health problems the past few years, it’s so good to see Jacob being this openly, genuinely happy.  This video felt like the end of an anime arc lol
Jacob legit got called Sanji. That's wild
It's so great to hear you actually say that you are happy, you deserve it all brother. <3
Halfway through. But I 100% expect the new photo for Biggrst Slut 2024 in the clearly yearly Alpharad Awards to be already featured in this video.  Edit: Finished the video. And it is beatiful. Loved it. Congratulations. Friends and all, this is one of the best things out there.
11:14 you thought we wouldn’t notice
Kid was going through it thinking he just met an irl anime character
Jacob being called sanji by a little kid is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard
11:14 or 11:13
💸💸💸💖
Luv this vide
This was cute and great! Have a great day
Honestly, I would have never thought to bring an extra bag for luggage before watching this video. Thank you, AlphaRad, for teaching me life lessons that I will cherish forever!!
A friend of mine recently came back from Okinawa! He was studying abroad and said he really did enjoy being there for a whole year! So it's cool hearing his stories, along with the experiences you had within this video. I'm thinking about going to Japan eventually, buuut i have other things on my plate as of now.  Also i wasn't expecting your talk about being a content creator in the middle of the video to hit as hard as it did. I first discovered you in highschool when you uploaded Luigi the Best and liked you for being a cool and energetic guy, but hearing how you felt about where you were is beneficial for everyone. I wanted to pursue content creation as hard as you did but I'm genuinely glad I'm pushing it to the side and worrying about it casually. As of now I just wanna go out, meet up with friends, and spend time with them to show I care
is it weird to say this viceo motivates me? like I've always wanted to be a youtuber or streamer or whatever but I could never get the motivation, never get in the right groove, but they way you talk so lovingly and honest about your experience really helps me out
Something about non US 7-elevens man(save for Hawaii), they’re all godlike
You also lead by example Jacob, I am very happy for and inspired by you rn! Also, it was super sweet of you to gift your friends ❤
Good for you alpharad!!! Keep doing what youre doing
I'm so glad you're finding happiness Alpha! I've been subbed for so long and I've loved watching your growth!
Any body see this 11:14
Thank you jacob
Why does he refer to jaiden as his accountant? 6:57
11:14 great joke
11:14 nice
Is alpharad and jaiden dating
He knows his friends
Hearing that your finally happy made me pop off so hard I broke my chair. Congrats though Jacob you deserve it.
Genius. The more suffering for your wallet, the funnier it is. The more comedy, the more money, the more money, the more wallet, which leads to more suffering.
so like did anyone else the the very mad dude dress in all pokemon or like
You know... I was smiling most of this but after the half way pint it turned to tears, but not sad ones. The talk of doing what you love, finding happiness in what you do, then the sheer joy of your mutuals getting those wonderful boxes, that contently looked like thought was put into each box...  I found this channel around the Amibo Smash videos and have been on and off, but this... This is a lock in.   You're a good man Jacob. Thank you for sharing a much needed smile and renew that maybe, just maybe, things will work out.
Honestly, Amazing video. I've been with your channel ever since your Mario Maker days. It's been an absolutely AMAZING 5 years that I've been following your channel (possibly even 7 because I remember you from one of your Mario 3D world vids).  I'm so happy for you Alpha, I'm so glad that you're finally finding true happiness in this stuff. I may not be a fan of finding happiness in having lots of merchandise and stuff like that, I'm proud that you are becoming a happier human being as a whole.     Right now I've been feeling very stressed over this stuff, and my future, so thank you VERY much Alpha. I wish you have a bright future ahead of you.
The plot twist that all the merch he was spending thousands on was gifts for his friends was so wholesome. I'm in tears right now.
W vid! Totally didn’t get emotional at the end.
This videos title should be re named to “I single handedly funded all of Pokémon’s games for the next 10 years by buying their merch”
Y'know, you could probably fly to japan and buy a japanese amiibo for cheaper than a scalper would sell you one for
Been watching you since 2014/2015 and even got to meet you at Evo either 2016 or 2017 can’t really remember honestly. But I’ve watched you grow as a person and this video made my cry of joy because of the happiness you feel. Just being in a position where you can give back to the people you care about and has helped you is really inspiring and just heartwarming. Dude I’m very glad you found your happiness, despite spend ungodly amounts of money, and it just warms my heart. Whether you see this or not extremely happy for you and looking forward to whatever content you have next. Thank you for sharing this with us!
Lucky bastard.  Not only did you go to Japan And get cool shit  But saw 1072 of One Piece the morning of!  Jealous doesn't begin to express how much i feel.
been watching you since How to Play Luigi 101...man I've really enjoyed your content Alpha and this video definitely got me emotional. Love you alpha!
Alpharad is Sanji now 😂
does anyone know the name of the song that starts playing at the 18:35 mark?
i was wondering why u hadnt been to japan yet but im glad u finally took the vacation u deserve! go on some more!!!! also spending that amt of $$$ makes sense if u spoil ur friends XDDDD
hey jacob. i say this as a non-subscriber who has watched you on and off for the last 6 years. enjoy life. i say this as a pilot who has seen very close friends die flying. dont let your job takeover your life.
soooooooo, new ace of hearts album?
I thought that he said that he was leaving YouTube for a second- 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
ALL HAIL SANJI SAN
Seeing everyone at the end genuinely makes me wish I could do what Alpha does, not just because he does cool things and gets sponsored by Pokémon themselves, but be able to absolutely just, be able to make their friends as happy as genuinely possible. It makes me so happy I could cry.
Pointcrow getting only god knows what
I think Nintendo is financially justified in "covering" you for another trip in the future.  xD Oh.  And I just had a realization about the "Sanji" encounter.  Japanese society is pretty conservative in certain aspects and bleached/dyed hair is still pretty heavily stigmatized among older generations.  Bleached hair is not something the kid likely saw among friend groups and his and their parents very often if ever.  And the parents having bleached/dyed hair would be like parents with lots of tattoos back in America; They can be great parents, but many other parents following more "traditional" values would view them as cutting against the grain.
never thought I would get emotional watching Alpharad
i've been watching you for 6 years. you are on of the most wonderful people on earth. I am so glad that you are finally happy.
I know Japan has economic collapse issues. It seems like a quick and easy fix that is subsidized air travel for Americans
I’m glad to know Alpharad would do the same stuff I would
New favorite youtuber
Bro my former camp counselor fail boat is friends with my favorite YouTuber
11:14 hit like a truck
Jaiden? Get 3 seconds of screentime, thats the gift
Didnt expected this wholesomeness
Happy to see you think Maccas and McDonalds Japan are some of the best!
this channel has evolved from a basic gaming channel to a full on emotional journey. incredible how far he has come.
Jaiden having tatts down both arms with the sleeveless top, in JAPAN. That look goes so hard.
I still cant believe that some dude ate someone else's Pokemon card in an attempt to get someone disqualified
Throughout all the youtubers in the world I have to say Alpharad is a personal hero of mine.   I remember watching him and just fell in love with his goofy personality. This video and all of his videos serve me happiness. This video and just hearing his struggles and relating. I just started to tear up. This man has been through alot and still gives so much to his fans, his friends, and who else more.   Alpharad. Idk if u will read this. But thank you for showing me a silver lining. Thank you for being the greatest youtuber in my life. I wish you the absolute best in your life.
I’ve been a long time sub from your overwatch days and honestly seeing you constantly evolve and change and move makes me so happy. I wanted to play ow because of you. And paladins and I picked up Pokémon again because of you. Playing s&s, arceus, sp, and a & v has been so nice and helped me rediscover my love for my childhood game. Thank you Jacob and I hope to continue to grow older with your content that I fell in love with when you would meme on ow
Hey alpha I really wanted to sort of thank you for this video and letting your viewers be apart of your experiences. This video might have been one of the most emotional impactful vids I’ve seen which is sort of crazy. You made me understand happiness and I’ll forever thank you for this video as it is a reminder of true happiness with friends.
Come on, man, you're gonna make me cry...
10:40 you DO look like Sanji WTF? the only thing is the beard
Jacob, your kindness and warm spirit really just touched so hard, and you sir are just downright amazing. Definitely an amazing person and such a warm spirit and heart. This is just the coolest~
eve jumpscare at 26:03
I'm so freaking happy you're happy my dude!!!! seeing you have fun is one of the best kinds of content. because lets be honest you deserve it
The Cucurucho cameo is crazy-
8:04 I like em 😊
11:14 is no one going to mention that?
I've been watching your videos since smo came out and you've become a huge part of my life, I'm always waiting to see wth your gonna come up with next, I love recognizing your voice on other creators videos and just like the fact that you exists at this point, you truly deserve the world and I'm so happy that you're happy
11:14  good for you Jacob
20:36 who is she
Being so close to everyone you hold dear, loving them enough to give them gifts that mean the world to them… and even finding that small warm share of happiness for yourself. You’ve gone way beyond the funny smash player guy you were in the beginning. I’m happy for you.  Though that trip cost almost literally two of me, Jesus Christ.
Cause I like all you’re content, and ace of hearts, I bought that cd and can’t stop listening
You think YOU have a problem with spending money? I get like ≈750€ per month. I got the money yesterday and i've already spent like 350 on gambling.   And i don't think i will stop either (I can't if i wanted to. I'm in too deep). I gotta chase the losses, forget the scf, i have money to make!
"50 Shades of Fucked Up." - Alpharad 2023
Now this is the top of YouTube. Thanks for making such great video for so long and hope your mental health gets better.
at first i (and im sure a lotta other people) was like "dude jacob jesus christ... but then seeing him give stuff to his friends who helped him out in so many ways made me tear up (again as im sure a lotta other people got). jacob is a fucking amazing guy and is not just an internet funny man but a great friend/person
Going to visit for the first time too at the end of October! Happy for you Alpharad!
Sees empty luggabe bag, has faint suspicion it isn't gonna be enough. :V
I thought this was gonna be a normal video of Jacob being irresponsible with money but NO. This video has emotionally struck me in a way that was unexpected. You’re awesome Jacob and I’m glad you’re happy
The double big mac is called the Mega Mac. I had it when I went to the Philippines in 2016 and we had a layover in the Tokyo airport.   It made my American heart cry with joy (and diabeetus).
Japan Merch go next level, they don't just got anime stuff
it feels weird to say this because I don't know any of you all in this video, but this made me really happy to watch. seeing people I recognize just being happy is a really cool feeling, even if I don't know them. I guess it gives me hope that I can make my friends this happy someday
I mean, I’m super happy for you and your emotional growth, but are we… are we just gonna gloss over that last frame from day 4?
I love he said anime mermaid but really it was ariel
I Love you Alpha  You make my days happy When they are trash, and im happy that you are so huge  I wish I was like you, you made my Love for Pokemon bigger, thanks a lot for All those times you made my days better
This video is now property of Earnie Gang
11:14 😳
*New goal:* Befriend Alpharad
Try Caribbean fast food, come down during Carnival season
The gifts at the end 😭 I’m not emotionally stable enough for that after a long day at work! Seriously 100/10 video I’m going to watch it again with my sibling to make them cry bc we’ve both been fans for a few years (but I lost my old account so there’s no proof)
15:30 I knew Connor was gonna show up at some point lol
Giwi getting only Shanks merch, Dash getting the Baby in Car sticker, and Jo getting the Blue Pikmin are all such perfect gifts.
I would be a blessing or a curse for your wallet
The last bit is the sweetest thing, holy shit 😭
"Subscribe or your cringe" is the hardest thing to say to get someone to subscribe!
i think the person Jacob is kissing is Jan. all i can say is if you need an officiant hit me up
Did not see the wholesome ending coming, niceee
he really just flexed on us in 2 different languages
Moral of the story don’t spend your entire cash
There hasn't been a single day in the last 14 years I haven't thought of killing myself
I wonder how often you heard "Nihon Jyozu".... despite not being so "Jyozu".
Please make a video of showing off the Pokémon merch please  Edit: wow
Thank you alpharad. Your videos have helped a ton of us, and you’re deserving of this. You’re a great person, and incredible in general. I’m glad you’re happy, and hope you’ll stay like that for the rest of your life.
Man yer living my dream.
11:14
Happy for you Jacob, glad you’re feeling great, it’s crazy to me that I’ve been watching since I was in 6th grade and I’m graduating highschool this year. You’ve provided me with so much joy and this video was exactly the same. Cheers brother
I had such a big grin that entire last portion. I wish i could be as good of a friend as Alpharad. I gotta keep working hard to get to a point where i can give back also. I love your work and who you have become. You are an inspiration to me.
W
This video has really inspired me to not take my friends for granted or anything in that matter, I want to give back to my friends that gotten me this far in my life but I can't because I don't have a job or any money.
11:14 Alpha,what is the context behind this???
Its kinda cathartic seeing someone else live out your dreams
11:14 I saw that last frame Jacob
I already know it stung to give away the Whimsicott XD
Man it's been a journey watching this channel grow. I've been here since the early days of Smash Ultimate, and I love the direction this channel has taken, and it makes me all the happier to hear that you enjoy making it as well. Keep enjoying life to the fullest, I'd say you've earned it!
This video made me cry. It is so full of love it is overwhelming. I am absolutely overjoyed for you and I wish I can reach your level of contentedness someday. It is a massive love letter that showcases what its like to love and to be loved. To be appreciated, valued, and cherished. I aspire to feel that way and to make others feel that way just as you have. Congratulations for reaching this point in your life and thank you for showing us that it is possible. My heart is so full :)
I wonder who spent more, Jacob or maxmoefoe in Japan
I've been watching you for a long time man. I'm so glad you can so genuinely say you're happy!
01:19. Same when I visited Fam in Guatemala for the first time. 🍔🍟🥤
6:58  ......... is your accountant jaiden?
Admit it, this was just to justify the price tag, wasnt it? XD  Jokes aside, what a great ending.
OMG SANJI-SAN IM BIGGEST FAN PLEASE YOU ARE SO COOL SANJI-SAN 😊
We love you Jacob ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍💘💝💖💓💗💞💕❣💔❤‍🔥❤‍🩹
you are a good soul
Well, they definitely chose the right person to make Japans merch industry a little bit richer
i love this guy
That was so Wholesome
I'm glad to be subscribed to alpharad
As a 3+–year Alpharad viewer now, it’s incredible to see how much he’s grown. Hearing him say just how blissful his life is right now, along w the end reveal of giving all his friends those presents, made me cry tears of joy. I really wish nothing but happiness & positive things for him & his future. Never _EVER_ stop being you Jacob—you’re a dazzling light in this gloomy world ✨💖✨
This is the one sponser from alpharad i'm ok with
Going anywhere results in spending too much money tbh
alpha u are genuinly one of the goats of yt keep up the amazing job brodie
Tell me someone saw this 11:14
Seeing Jaiden is a chiikawa fan is great, I’m so obsessed with those little critters
11:14 just gonna leave this here for no reason at all
3:33 THE FUNNY NUMBER
11:14 now THIS is content
MAN!!! The persona music on this video SLAPS HARD
While I wish I could have gone to Japan myself, I have to say being a part of this community means I get to view whatever crazy ideas Jacob has next. And that is truly a great gift to be hold in of itself. From way back then to now, I don't regret subscribing many years ago and I wouldn't have it any other way.
I am now heavily jealous of all the awesome shit Jacob got, I will be saving all my money now for my trip there next year ❤️
are we gonna graze by a man making out with his homie at 11:14 this is why i subscribed to this man
i cant help but feel envy. i cant help it, but im jealous you have so many people you keep close
11:14 AFuckingYO
As someone who got out of a major depressive spiral a few years ago, this hit me like a truck. The feeling that there’s a gaping void in you that grows, and no matter what you put into it, it’s still there. So much so that it becomes a part of you. It can be really frustrating, and I’m glad you’re happy. You’ve been one of my favorite content creators for years, and I love watching your videos. I know you probably won’t see this, but I just want to let you know that no matter what you think, you deserve the happiness you have right now. I’m sorry this is so long, but I hope you have a great day.
Just 1 empty bag ? should bring 2 just in case. Jaiden see need 3-4 and another person to stop her. also hii "Sanji-san"
Most holesome shibuya ark ever
Yeah, we're gonna need the full footage of Pchal doing Karaoke lol
5:06 every time i see this fortnite collaboration chart i lose a little more of sanity 💀
Full respect Jacob. Best content creator of the year
1:29 YOOOOOOO im glad to know us aussies make the best maccas
The kid thinking is Jacob is Sanji is the cutest thing I've ever heard, I'm crying.  Edit: Ok I got to the end and I can't decide what's cuter, that or Jacob buying his friends a ton of shit that he knew they'd like.
I'm quite jealous of this funni man, but he didn't manage to make it this far without hard work, so I'll take that as an inspiration, hopefully I'll see japan personally on my own, thank you funny man
11:14 THIS MADE ME AUDIBLY GASP AND AND YA KNOW?? BIG POG MOMENT??  edit: this video was amazinggggggggggggg
money well spent
this makes me wanna make a youtube video on a very depressing topic now…
I love the fact that you used the music from mario 3d world level: Hands on Halls to start the video
this video called me poor
Seeing you have 8 suitcases stuffed full of merch and the absolutely jaw-dropping 17 THOUSAND you spent makes me realize just how much this channel has done for you. It's allowed you to go on the trip of a life-time, one that I'm sure you won't soon forget.  This was possibly my favorite video in some time, and felt very down to earth. That ending made me grin ear to ear as well 😂  I wish all the best and more to you, and a good rest of your year!  Glad you had fun! Edit: misspellings
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Greeted by the one and only HATSUNE MIKU
This is one of the most wholesome videos I’ve ever seen. Happy You Enjoyed Japan
“I’m not a pokemon YouTuber guys”
I barely know a tierce of the people at the end but I honestly started to cry a little seeing their happiness. I'm also genuely happy to know that you are happy, you deserve it <3
It's so cool being sponsored by Pokémon! Must be a real dream come true! Congrats, dude! That ending is so wholesome! Great video! 🙏
I recently went on a trip to Japan with a friend who also went for the first time. Needless to say, all of these reactions and impulsive spending is very familiar to me hahaha.
Words can't begin to describe how inspirational and wholesome this is. As a long-time fan, I love everything about this and wish you all the best going forward
Oh my god you look like you had so much fun there, you are living my dream, dude! Congratulations so much Jacob, I've been watching you for nearly a third of my fucking *life* at this point (since around Game & Watch 101), and your entire content creation journey has just been fucking fun. You've actually been such a huge inspiration towards the person I want to be in life, and I have had way too many damn laughs with all of your videos. May be a little weirdly parasocial or some shit, but I am crazy happy for you for finding happiness too. I remember the start of your mental health arc ages ago, and it's just very satisfying to see you genuinely happy after all this time. Keep being you Alpharad, you're an inspiration and comic to so many damn people. Peace!
This video cured my depression
the ending to that video has probably made so many people have a tear in their just like this 😢i know i had multiple. you have to be one of my favourite people on this site it makes me so happy to see people treat their friends so well ❤
Thank you Pokémon! <3 Thank you Alpharad! <3
Bro I can’t judge at all cause if I was in your situation I’d probably end up even more in the hole 😂
Right as you said the kid pointed and excitedly said “Sanji-San” I immediately knew what was coming 😂
I love hearing your once in a two year period update on the alpha rad life and I am glad you have found your happy place. Your my favorite YouTuber I’ve been here for years and I hope to be here for many more! whatever you decide to do!
I didn't think there was such a thing as too wholesome but here it is
my favorite part is when he talks how is grown as a person thats kinda inspiring for myself as person who watched sense he was 8 and now im 14 thxs for making my late child hood man❤
Hearing Alpharad talking about Japan make me miss it. I need my 7-11 beef curry
this video so aweosme. i cry
I'm gonna be honest if I had the chance my spending probably wouldn't be much better, if at all
dude, just ,,, dude
Awesome, you’ve grown so much as a person, you’re doing great!!
So how much money did you spend total?
I am very glad that my country is in the S tier for maccas haha! One time our McDonald's made shiny chip packets to stop the seagulls from stealing chips
6:04 OH MY GOD, ITS POLTCHAGUIST
This video made me physically feel better
11.14 jacob is haveing ablast i see
this is the cutest video ever oh my god.
Holy shit he does kinda look like Sanji
Bro seeing Anri live sounds so fucking cool
You got the Weed Cat plush so its worth it don't worry.
Alpha why did you pay for your claw machines? Don't you know that CdawgVA will pay for it if you guys make a video out of it?
I guarantee you, alpha felt amazing and had a huge smile watching all his friends reactions.
bro looks like sanji
Jacob Alpharad Video brings grown men to their knees
You’re not just gonna gloss over that second bit
altrive laughing at 22:25 has my heart and truly understands humor to whoever the other guy was was not
one of your best videos yet. I love how you included like 7 minutes of just your friends because it makes you happy /gen
This video legit made me cry you were always one of my favorite creators alpharad but now you became one of my favorite people in the world and I wish i can someday make as many people happy as you do.  Im so happy for you keep at it champ.
Alpharad. This is cool dude. This is super nice of you. I wish I could do this. One day of my friends just surprised him with so much gifts. They don’t know what to do with.
Nice dreamcast shirt
Of course, Jaiden and her love for joltik:D
where's my gift
The Sanji - san fan interaction was adorable
Absolutely brilliant
MY GOATTTTT
I love how one of the only times Weegee appears is to say “uhhh… sexy babes”
Alpharad's such a good guy
god hes the fucking goat
I've been watching you since the early smash bros days! It's been awesome watching your channel grow over the years and I hope it will continue to grow!
Okay so no one is going to talk about Alpharand Kissing a guy O-O
HOLY SHIT THE SLIDING INTO THE DMS CLIP WAS NEARLY 5 YEARS AGO WHAT THE FUCK
I didn’t expect for this to get so profound and personal but I respect and appreciate that a lot. Thanks for sharing that & glad you’re happy with things the way they are now!
Not the p0rn at seven eleven- 💀
honestly seeing someone who i've been watching since their youtube beginnings grow and help themselves become happy is just an incredibly warming thing to see? genuinely, you're an inspiration and i'm so happy you've grown like you have, even if that's a little 'parasocial' to say keep doing you because most of us would probably watch anything you make just because you carry your content
Why is nobody talking about the part where Jacob and Jan making out
this video reminded me of when Fool for You dropped and oh god i need to listen to that again
11:14 I knew I saw something
i've been watching you for maybe 7 years at this point, and I agree with all these positive comments. wish you the best!
I would've been happy with this just being a funny video about poor financial decisions, but the added chat about you just....having a good time was so great to hear. I feel like the question of "what are you doing and does it make you happy" is one of the hardest things to ask yourself because what the hell even is happiness and if where you are doesn't grant you that joy what will? I feel like I've barely truly experienced the world and I'm already coming to this question. I am so glad that you've been able to work on yourself and get to a place where you can say you feel happy as well as having a large vacation that filled you with bliss. And to top it off, giving the stuff you horded from Japan to the people you feel you owe so much to is something I would want to to my friends if ever given the financial stability. In general, I loved this video. It really lifted my spirits. Thank you Alpharad.
Yo biggest take away? Jaiden is tatted TF UP 7:00
dude i absolutely respect you so much for doing all of that dude what even, you're such an inspiration to me and you're literally one of my favorite youtubers, can't wait to go back home to Hawaii to see and do what I love, pokemon :)
"I play modded games and say fuck, so I'm just as surprised as you are." -Jacob Alpharad, 2023
11:14 WHAT THE HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL DAWG OMG NO WAYYYYYY
tbh i would have cried and broken down in joy if I got to meet Yuka Morii and do a clay workshop with her
What an amazing video, Alpha be giving back like his own take of Mr.Beast and its insane, most of the tubers I watch don't go this hard for their friends and teams and just shows I sub'd to the real one
Bro experienced Live Chuusen, my condolences
Thank you for all of your hard work Alpharad I’m glad you’ve found your happiness and continue to strive towards it
Since 2014?  I've been following since 2018 and it feels like yesterday.  Congratulations on all your success and happiness Jacob, it's well deserve and well shared <3
When he was going about spending like crazy I was thinking “haha silly boi, but go off king is your trip” then at the end to learn how much he cares and genuinely loves his friends, I became a sobbing mess.   I may have only know his channel for a short period of time, but regardless I am proud of this man and how much he has accomplished 🤍
also, man is the living embodiment of "what is the point of money if not to spend it on me and my friends" and I'm HERE for it
This has to be one of my favorite videos to date. Thank you Jacob for allowing us to be a part of your life. Your journey.
bro thought we weren’t gonna notice that “soul link” at the karaoke spot
thanks for keeping it real, dude. genuinely awesome to see that youre happy :)
I have watched many videos before, but this is one of the only videos that makes me enjoy how I can access great videos like this. The music ties it together as well. Hope you're doing well, man!
Jesus, if Australian Maccas (I refuse to use its real name) is top of S tier, that’s disappointing to know it doesn’t get better.
I had a really rough day today but this video put a big smile on my face. I can’t thank you enough for all the gifts! Never in a million years did I think we would ever cross paths and become friends, but you’ve become one of my dearest friends in the past few years. You care so much for us and know us all so well. I strive to be such a sweet friend like you. You deserve the world. Much love Jacob 💙
That was fuckin wholesome my man
Great video but maybe spend a little, less next time you travel somewhere.
Sanji-san!
"It makes me even happier to say I'm happy" Now THAT! Is some good soup.
I would pass out if this happened to me, I'm so so glad you had the chance. You more than deserve it for how thoughtful you are.
3:00 I better not be the only one who sees it
I really want to go to Japan someday. Every time I see stuff in Japan my drive to go there only increases. I only recently got into anime and I still have a lot to explore there. Ahhh, I just wanna go so badly!
10:28......the kid is on to somthing
I doubt you will actually see this Alpharad, but if you do, your bit about finally being able to say your happy, how happy that made you to say. That bit I just want to say I needed to hear that, its hard  and sometimes I struggle to always keep in mind that one day I will be able to say that I am happy too. Seeing you say that helped remind me that I'll be okay. Thank you.
Alpharad did it, he reached influencer nirvana
Back when I first started watching you Jacob, I tried to mimic you and your funny guy personality as much as possible, you were honestly such an inspiration for me. And as ive continued watching you as youve grown and changed, I've noticed it in myself as well. Thank you for making such amazing content after all this time.
Hey Jacob I’m your friend right?
Man, that trip was sick! I wish I could’ve been there for worlds, because that’s such a cool experience! Maybe next year 😅
I’ve never been more jealous in my life then I do now
11:14 i saw that.
It’s fine we’re happy if you’re happy you know you can just make content and be yourself have fun that’s what being YouTube is all about have fun
I wish I could go to Pokémon championship I have finished the violet version of Pokémon
Honestly, the kid calling Alpha Sanji-San is so on point similar length blonde hair and a brown beard. It’s not perfect but its close.
Just gotta say Jacob's eye for gift giving is absolutely insane.
Truly pure content. Enjoying life and spreading that joy to others!
11:14 pause it at this moment for your own risk
The Magnemite looks so happy. I wish I was Magnemite❤
Dream come true
Dog, like...usually im all for people buying things they like...but you need restraint man. Thats not healthy. 17 THOUSAND??? Dude
11:13 Oh my
Haha, I hope the first thing PointCrow saw was 7-eleven adult magazines. I'm glad you found some zen!
Is that persona music i hear Might i even dare Say from persona 4  if im right
Are justo gonna ignore the kiss... is just me?... oh... OK.... (i cried with the ending BTW)
yo love that compilation at the end everyone was so happy but in the end Alphabad was the happiest of them all he found the One piece its real!
9:50 ZIPPO MENTIONED! BRADFORD MENTIONED!
Eastern 7-11s are absolutely fabulous. Like, they are so much better than ours here in America. (That I’ve been to, anyway)
we just gone gloss over 11:14 aight
Unironically, im super happy to hear that your doing well. Like not to get prosocial, but its always hard to see content creators we love sacrificing their livelihoods for it and just hearing that your non-sarcastically, not a bit, just really happy and had some of the best days in your life is honestly some of the best content on this channel.
Nice video Alpharad, glad you had fun and you shall continue to be an amazing friend to your people/ tribe :)
All I can say after watching the vid,   Big Alpharad/Jacob W
Hit!
As someone who has been watching you since 2016 (7 years!! Actually crazy) it’s been amazing to see how much you’ve grown and how far you’ve come not only as a content creator but also as a person. I truly hope the rest of your days are spent just as happy as you were on this vacation. Me and many others will be by your side until the end. Sending love 💜💜💜
it is so weird seeing old Alpharad
That dragon air plush was worth it
Well alpha if you are actually reading this comment I’d say you should be fine though the rest of your life. You and your friends have done amazing things together and so I will say you should cherish your friends and the memories you spend with them. Also don’t worry about taking a fucking break from content making you deserve it you workaholic gamer Jesus Christ.
That kid who though you were Sanji-san (from what you said) sounded like he really thought you looked like him. It’s always sweet in a way that someone (the kid in this case) thought you looked like a character he must have really liked. It’s cool seeing how people who live across the world from each other, have a language barrier, and who like the same series can have a (hopefully) positive interaction like this
so jealous that you saw anri omg
Being a fan for so long, this video was super sweet
Holy crap is this one of the best YouTube videos (if not the best) I’ve ever seen in my life. What an emotional roller coaster
That Jacob and Jan kiss tho 👀 11:14
I wish I had a friend like Jacob🥺
Man that was so sweet, happy you’ve been given these incredible opportunities, you deserve it 100%
0:58 Why is this a movie now? I'm not complaining, I love it, buuut why?
Jesus loves you
Im so glad to see you feel happy. Its insane to me that ive been watching you for over 7 years now. You are so incredible. How well you treat everyone is just insane. You deserve every bit of happiness you have in your life and so, so much more. Thank you
11:13 whaaaaaaa!?!?!?
I font know how 11:14 is not the most replayed part
Wholesome vid
*on the phone to the accountant* Jacob: no no, you don’t understand-I put all the merch in a video, now it’s a tax write off-boom
7-11 has the best coffee out of all the convenience stores, mans got good taste
I Find It so funny and cute how his friends/editors react to the gifts he sent them. And of course It’s to their personality/liking. Seeing what they received, especially the Pokémon put the Biggest smile on my face.
Alpha nice work with your channel and taking time for yourself. Keep growing Alpharad 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
This is hands down the coolest and Moses based YouTuber known to man, spends so much to give, it brings a tear😢
Beautiful use of the Internet, checkpoint music
Yeah, you have friends. But you also pay attention to them, probably more than they thought. Those boxes could’ve been just generic, but you found a way to personalize them. This easily could’ve been a flex video of your wealth, but it was a flex video of how much you care about your friends which was a pleasant surprise.
Bro is broke
This comment is controversial As an aussie, seeing the mcdonalds tier list is very confusing. Am i the only one who thinks that the burgers here are just…. Really tiny and like…. Shit. The nuggets are s tier and so are most of the other sides but seriously. Hungry jacks tho, idk what u guys did to stuff up ur burgerking but HJs is fire (zambrero on top tho that shit actual s tier can’t tell me im wrong im sorry u guys have to stick with tacobell)
I'm a very new fan of yours, only started watching you this year, but I'm really happy for you Alpharad. You've worked hard, come so far, and deserve the happiness you've achieved. I hope it stays with you.
How does it feel? Living *my* dream ?!
you're definitely my favorite youtuber but the sarcasm is too much to the point where its cringe
So we just not gonna talk about 11:14?
11:14 hit HARD
This is the most wholesome alpharad video ever
This made me cry
I'm so happy Sanji got invited by Pokemon
Dude, this is totally something I would also do if I was in your shoes. I love buying things for myself, but giving every one of my friends a box of personalized japanese pop culture merch? That's the most wholesome thing in the world. I'm glad you took that trip and found your source of happiness, and don't be afraid to take a break if you need it! You're an internet funny man, not a machine that pumps out videos. I'm just happy for you and your friends.
Your a legend
if Alpharad can, I will too. Go to japan, I mean.
NOT THE EMOTIONAL KH MUSIC
Kissing the homies 💪
Wonderful video!
The way this man talks and uses his hands enrages me
dad's one appearance being "i barely know english" is pretty funny
That ending was so sweet! I'm sorry to hear that you had a hard time over the past few years but happy you got the help needed and are living a better, happier life.
Hey Alpha, it's easy for me to be invested in and care about the people I watch for entertainment, especially when they put so much of themselves into their work. It means that when I hear that they're going through a rough patch or they're living through some of the best times ever it means a lot. I'm glad you're happy and I can't wait to see what you do next, I'm sure it'll be great.
11:14 best frame
You should of put CAUTION: Make sure you have 500,000 dollars worth of Yen for spending!!
Who was he kissing at 11:14 ?
I've been watching this channel for so long and I'm not stoping now also you make everyday at school les boring when I've got nuthing better to do
you're experiencing my DREAM PLEASMKFNFJMKLOPS i cant wait to finally get stationed there, just a few more months 😭😭😭
What did pointcrow get?
It's comforting to see you growing into an adult at the same time as me, glad to hear you're in a good place!
did you lip sync lmao? it just doent look right
Wolfe is 100% gonna analyse that show and probably use it too
That Split 1 Frame cut at 11:14 XD
I was not expecting this emotional semitruck at 2am but I'm here for it
👍
WHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT OF DAY 4 MY FRIEND 😟
This man needs to be hired at pokemon
Emotional rollercoaster of a video in the best way possible, start to finish. Hearing you talk about struggles on the platform but following it up with “I’m genuinely happy” was enough to bring a tear. Incredible ending, shout out to everyone that helps bring such incredible content.
wooper spotted
So wholesome ❤ Hope you keep doing better each day and have more happy days :)
I started watching you almost 3 years ago and I haven't regretted a thing. You're such a good friend . And I enjoy watching your videos  . ❤🎉 And you were one of my favorite YouTubers
Fuck man i went from finding a funny video called tengen toppa crashers to seeing my mans finally happy after everything he’s been through. Saying you deserve this is an understatement, cheers to the content to come. :)
This took such a wholesome turn I was not prepared for.
I noticed if you slow down in 11:14 He kisses a dude
I wanna visit Japan so bad. It's my biggest dream. But I can't afford it :c
Alpharad went to Shibuya WAYYYYY to close to October 31st!
This video was beautiful. I didn't expect to cry but here we are.
Did you get altrive pikmin 4 merch?
GG Alpharad, You are now the most loved friend in your friend group!
going tomorrow can't wait!
This is so nice, this is just your best video no matter on its youtube performance
I'm glad you had fun in my stupid country. XD. Worlds really changes Yokohama into a weird thing for a few weeks.
11:14 I knew that was going to happen since a saw PC before in the video
Does anyone know the music that plays at the end of the video when everyone is opening their presents?
man alpha is such a great guy
I only just recently got to the same mental place, where I'm actually happy and like myself.  I'm so, so happy for you, and this left me crying in my dorm.    I will say, the thing that shocked me most about Japan was how tall Jan is
so wait what was that on day 4
It really dawned on me as I was watching the gifting montage at the end that there are so many creators that I would never have discovered if they weren't part of Content Creator Cinematic Universe that is Alpharad's friend group. :)
Duuudeee, I think I started watching you waaaaaaay back with the funny smash compilations and meme edits, look at where you are now!   Keep growing, you're an inspirational person and I wish you more happiness in your future!   PS: For you to know your friends that well and sending them all personalized mystery boxes with their favorites, that proves your heart's in the right place🎉
I wish I could treat all my friends like this, ending was great Keep up what you're doing alpha you've deserved it all
I want to sleep on a pile of Pokémon plushies
You do look like Sanji lol
The first half made me laugh, but the second half made me smile
uplifting content gorge x
Congrats on trip, and the very long overdue vacation! You deserve it king! Next time, you should visit Kyoto, and visit the Nintendo HQ and maybe even monkey mountain.
I'm really glad that you are happy and that you were able to get out of the void you felt. Also I was smiling all the time your friends were showing their gifts.
im so happy alpha likes one piece i heckin love one piece
I have that dame dragonair, its awesome
did you put one piece spoilers in your japan vlog 💀
Shameless, I’m not buying Pokémon slideshow(aka. Scarlet and violet)
That second half is really heartwarming. I’m glad you are in a better place.
I cannot pick a better video to make my first comment to. I've loved your videos and want to make some of my own  because of this.
That Sanji kid was based asf lol
It makes me so happy and I know it makes all of your other subscribers happy to hear you say that you are finally happy. Keep it up Jacob ❤️
Another video & another adventure with alpha and Jaiden in Japonnnnn 🇯🇵🇯🇵
Maybe the real mechandise were the friends we made alkng the way
oh my
Plz tell me he was in a trash taste episode I saw Connor
So on October 69
Karaoke w Jan was probably legendary, I wanna hear it
You deserve all the happiness and great opportunities that come to you! You are one of my favorite youtubers to watch in my free time in university :)
nice
His phone your walking to much have you been kidnapped
Im just starting the video but... McDonald's Mexico good? That's... I don't want to know the quality on other places below if our McDonald's is an A in the tier list, omg
Im glas you had fun alpharad ❤
BRO, that last part just gave me more fuel to study, im at engineering because i like it ofc, but i want money, to have a lot of time to spend with my friends, buying them shit they like and that  ThankYou, Alpha U .U
I hope you know how much you mean to people... I also hope noone sees this because that's really scary but I just had to voice the emotions, seeing this is so amazing I've been watching for years and watching you grow from someone whose content I was guilty about enjoying as a teen, chasing after a nintendo youth I never had as a kid, trying to know more and play better than my peers to satiate my envy To seeing you changing your content to this sort of celebration of happiness, the music where passion was so much more important than income, suddenly all these other incredible people as your friends and just watching someone sort out their life and become happier and happier... Your story has meant so much to me for my plans for the future, from such simple affirmations of that life doesn't have to revolve around college to showing that there's such amazing people out there... it's so strange how the internet can bring that, someone who doesn't know me has maybe influenced me more than those people closest to me As I'm trying to get my life together now and I've started serious work on creating the art I hope to turn into my life, seeing this video, seeing what is possible, I don't think I've ever seen anything or anyone as inspirational before. Thank you for being here and thank you for what you've done and what you're doing, so much. I hope that in five years I can come back to this and see if I can say so genuinely they I am happy too ... I don't think I'd be able to live without trying and trying and trying Thank you so much, I'm sorry for being weirdly personal but that's just how it is online I suppose... I didn't know you could simultaneously have so much respect for and be so proud of someone I can't wait to see where you continue to take your content and when you'll make me cry next
Zoro, wrong way!
If I wasn’t already subscribed, this video would’ve made me
Bro this is literally me I got back from a two week trip to Japan yesterday And I spent A LOT of money on random things To be fair Miyajima Island was the only place I've ever seen sell an ocarina in real life
This video made me smile :]
Earlier this year after Graduation I went with 8 of some of my closest friends on a trip to Japan, I spent too much money as well (my understanding of 'too much' is much lower than Alpharad's understanding of 'too much'). I got to know things about my friends that I never knew before, enjoyed even seemingly mundane things such as the 7-Elevens mentioned in this video, explored many different landmarks and places and came back with 2 more suitcases than I brought on the trip. Now don't get me wrong, I was extremely happy with the trip, it was definitely the biggest thing I had ever done in my life, but after watching this video, I truly appreciate all my friends near me, and look back on every single day of my trip knowing it will be nearly impossible to ever top that trip.  When I saw this video in my recommended, I thought "Hah, a funny coincidence that Alpharad and his friends went on a trip at nearly the same time as me and my friends and a funny coincidence that he spent a stupid amount." But now I truly just wish everyone can have an experience like this. Go on a big trip with some friends, cut loose for a while and look back and realise that you had a great time.
This is awesome, I'm happy for you
:)
nice to hear i cried cant say the same but im happy for you
I’ve loved watching you over the years. Hearing your happy is great  to hear. Hope you continue to make great content and to enjoy making it with the people around you!
This video made me feel so great inside. Great on you man.
That last part had me smiling so much, you are an awesome man!!   This was sent from yours truly,  Sans Undertale xx
7:00 gotta collect ‘em all
Imma be real when you showed the amount of money you spent in total I physically recoiled like it was a jumpscare, but I'd say the outcome at the end was worth it. :)
The tears I can’t stop them.
Id be lying if I said this didn't make me cry.  What a friend lad, not only did you get a nice break and enjoy your deserved break, but you also took the time to get your friends gifts. Wholesome.
This is the first ever video I have saw semi-sponsored by Nintendo themselves
This entire video is ethier a flex or a way to tax write off every purchase shown in the video
11:14 woah there man
hey i just came home from Japan today lol
That ending quite legitimately caught me off-guard that was like some Studio Ghibli emotional stuff, I couldn't help but have this big old dumb grin on my face😊
Thanks for buying one piece 🙌🏾💯🤩
Sure you may be wanted for credit card debt but it looks like it was worth it
Connor needs to challenge alpharad to a crane game video now
As a long-time (maybe 5-6 years, maybe more, maybe less, idk for sure) viewer, this felt...weird. Starting with the typical funny alpharad and turning into an emotional release talk was a very welcome surprise.  Easily one of my favorite videos for not just the video itself, but for you as a person.  Okay, that came out weird, but you know what I mean...right?
2:44 Ultraman Blazar jumpscare
11:14 alpha-
Also also, that shirt slaps! Anyone knows where can I find it?
Genuinely, this channels means a lot, I have had my ups and downs. But the amount of days where Jacob Alpharad has brough a boiling laughter out of me can't be counted. He has helped me get through boring events, been a place for unironically some of the best wisdom, and most of all is a channel I can always come back to when I need some comfort. I've been watching since 2016 when the luigi is the best video came out, thank you Alpha for everything you've done. Truly glad to hear that you are in a better place now.
Just an F.Y.I about your thumbnail, Japan doesn't normally use the "Y with 2 lines in it" to represent money. What's actually used is the character "円" ("en") which means "round". You probably saw it a bunch of times at the right side of the price on signs.
Seems like you had blissful time at Japan
The actual reason 7-eleven is the "holy land" for american tourists is that it's the most reliable place to find ATMs that will accept american credit cards, but yes all the stuff you can buy there is cool too EDIT: After finishing the video, let me just say that as a long time viewer I'm legitimately glad to hear you had an amazing vacation and that you feel happy with your life. It was very cool of you to buy so much merch for your friends.
Everything you have is well deserved dawg! Happy that this trip turned out so well for you.  side note, who else notice that cut at 11:14?
Dude im 13, i had a bunch of money in my wallet from past birthdays about 300 or more dollars and the second i could go to the shops on my own boom having a 3 doller donut for brekfast cause i cant wake up fast enough to have brekfast
I was getting jealous about all the things you were getting, but when I saw the ending it just reminded me about how good friendship is. Alpharad is the best friend I have ever seen ❤
Funny how I was in Japan at the same time as so many youtubers, but I went alone because I have no friends.  Guess I need to become a youtuber to get friends.
bro the roller coster of emotions you were dealinmg with while still recording videos for other people is amazing tho.  i think we all thank you for this, you deserved that trip to japan and that 20 days day off!! you go! :'D <3
11:14
captialism in america vs capitalism in japan
I’ll be honest, when I saw Shibuya, I was half expecting a Jujutsu Kaisen reference 💀
Man
Ok but what did you send to Pointcrow
anyone gonna talk about that kiss at the end of day four??? Not judging, just a very funny jumpscare
Wow 😻😻😻😻😻  This is such an awesome trip you had (and the bill behind the merch, food, etc. was nuts), I'm happy you enjoyed it, especially that Hatsune Miku Live concert. Now that you've let me (and others, duh) know that there are actual Splatoon 3's arsenal over there, makes me want 1 of those 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I‘ve never even owned that much money
10:51 knowing law fans, that should NOT be clean
They knew what they were doing. Congratulations alpharad. You deserve to enjoy yourself at Japan
Hey Jacob, just wanna say thank you for all the videos, been watching for a very long while now and they have helped me grow and go through tough times I'm glad you found a way to be happy, and somehow you posted this just as things seem to be going up in my life and I'm starting to be happy as well  Please keep making more, without overworking/neglecting yourself 😄  Thanks for everything
1:30 Scotland in A tier is a pretty based take ngl
This was a surprisingly wholesome video and I’m glad
Jacob don’t think we missed you putting that photo of you kissing him (I can’t remember his name)
11:14
9:55 Omg it’s Lebanon jahames!!!!1!!11
I almost never press like on videos, but this one is one of those likes. You earned it Alpharad.
Pokémon company made a profit on flying you and Jaiden out
Okay this video honestly had me crying. I'm so glad that you are finally in a place that you're happy, Jacob. You honestly deserve it with how hard you work on this channel and how kind you are.  Also, seeing all of his friends' reactions when opening their gifts was so wholesome! 🥰
Thanks for being such an amazing friend 💜  Can't wait to adventure through Japan with you the next time 🫡
I’m glad you got to experience all of this Jacob, and that it made you happy. Keep up all the amazing content, can’t wait to experience all of it
I definitely see Jacob doing a Sanji cosplay now. Thanks random Japanese kid
This video has got to be the best tax write-off I've ever seen. Jokes aside, HOLY SHIT ALPHARAD CONGRATS!
My favorite category of Alpharad video is when it’s very clearly an excuse to get a tax writeoff
Jacob Alpharad making me cry around minute 15. Happy for my favorite content creator
sir jacob alpharad, I have been a silent (yet religious) viewer of your channel since 2015, which is a stupidly long amount of time as you noted in the video. I teared up to hear you were finally feeling happy again, as it was clear to me and likely other viewers that you were going through a rough patch but still put yourself out there to try to make the best content you could. Keep on going good sir, your joy and happiness is infectious to your viewers and clearly your friends. your videos have been with me through all my rough times as well. thank you for doing what you've been doing, and keep on keeping on for as long as this brings you joy.
Anyone gonna talk about how alpha and Pokémon challenges just kissed??😂
I love how he knows he knows his friends so fricken well and all of the being so ecstatic to receive their gifts is just so wholesome.
i'm just glad that alpharad is happy and had fun with his friends :D honestly, those are the best things anyone can have. glad he's taking care of himself and his loved ones!
i one day hope to do what you just did for all your friends, thats literally so awesome man im so glad you had fun and you seem like a genuinely great friend because you managed to remember what all your friends would love
Glad to see my goat is happy
please say that Shonen jump store had promised neverland....👀
So proud of your growth, Jacob! Glad you enjoyed your trip🤭💕💕
21:57 ADRIAANNNAAAA
I’m glad you’re happy alpharad, we love you
Shanks is on the inside and outside *coughs* me taking a second to process  Wait a minute- AYOOOOOOOO
I am so happy for you Jacob! This has actually brought a tear of joy in my eye. 🥲I am soo happy that you enjoyed your time in Japan! I hope to go there myself one day 🤩
End actually got me to cry
20:53 Porn  It a joke
Cheers from Big Band Happy Birthday combo guy, you sent people to go watch my video when you were streaming Skullgirls a long time ago and I was awe-struck seeing ALPHARAD GANG pop up in my notifications repeatedly for a good couple days.  I've been aware of you since your Hat in Time supercut and continue to get a heart-warming kick out of hearing Hat in Time music continue to live on in your uploads.  This looked like such an amazing trip and honestly probably one of your best uploads in recent time!  This really had everything, including one of the most unexpectedly wholesome heartfelt expositions I wasn't quite ready for.  You brought tears to my eyes with that epic twist in the end of the video, it shows character to pull a boss move that big to give back to your friends to the level you did.  You've earned my respect more than ever before, and I am proud to come back and yell...ALPHARAD GANG.
ARE we not ging to talk about the rlly short clip where he kissed that guy
ayyy karaoke plus
so happy for you, really great video. (does anyone know the name of the kindom hearts song that plays at 16:24?)
Literally the best content creator on planet Earth.
Ok guys in Australia dollars 1 yen is about 1 cent. 100 yen is a dollar
All the small details Jacob remembers about each and every one of his friends, what a wholesome thing to do!
27 minute one piece ad
expect an alpharad x pokechallenges fanfic soon... (pause at 11:13 and you will understand)
You casually just spent 17 THOUSAND DOLLARS
I wish I could spend like that, but nope, gotta actually think if I can afford to buy a 6$ t-shirt.
I really wanna know what else was in PointCrow's box besides the Gear 5 Luffy. What couldn't he show on stream, Jacob? 😂
Hey here's pewdiepie there
I've loved watching this channel evolve, so wholesome
as someone who has been around since before you hit 10k, this video actually made me cry.
I realize this is an unhealthy relationship to have with online figures, but I’ve always been anxious about how much creators actually enjoy the stuff their making. If the act of creating is making them miserable then what’s the point? Letting that anxiety get to you isn’t great, which is why I appreciate that message at the end so much. So many creators focus so much on their online personas that it can be hard to tell what is real and what is not. Congratulations on reaching this point, and I hope anyone else reading this will get there too.
I'm sorry what does seven eleven sell
All the Persona music was fitting and perfect.  And then stickerbrush symphony. Just so good
Japan is a place i  really want to vacation at while im still in my 20's, but for the whole time ive been saving up its like the opening montage from the movie Up where things happen and i have to pull some money from my Japan trip funds.  But at least i can live vicariously through youtube videos like this.
Man, I can’t believe Sanji went to Japan. Crazy!
might have peaked with this video, i don't know if it gets better than this  glad you can say you're genuinely happy & also share that happiness with everyone around you
Why your face doin that
after hours of looking online into postgame pokemon and raids, its obviously alpharad i find out what requirements i need for 6/7 star raids. i tip my hat
The Pokémon sponsoring what is ultimately a mental health video feels right
Haha 11:14 nice try jacob we saw it
Zoro being lost in the thumbnail warms my heart
So did him and pokemon challenges kiss or what
11:14 dang
Of course this video has a lot of Persona music...
This is the reason I want to be a youtuber
11:14
As an Australian I’m glad you think our maccas is S teir
11:14 what happens In Japan stays in Japan 😂
I love Hatsune Miku
...I'm kinda jealous of you. Most people don't have the kind of wealth and time to do the self-reflection you've done, or the kind of job that will let them take their time and shift around their lives like you have. I'm happy for you, and I just wish I could do the same.  I also wish I could get all those Pokemon plushies. That wouldn't solve my problems, but it wouldn't hurt.
11:14 UMMMM UHHHHH IS THAT PCHAL???????? JACOB CARE TO EXPLAIN?
I'm so happy you're happy, this video was so emotional and beautiful, you are truly an inspiration to everyone and I can't wait to see what you create next !
Alpha i love the persona 5 music (also Australia maccas S-tier WOOHOO)
I gotta say Aussie maccas, slaps hard, if you're ever here, try some, you won't regret it. That sentence has more of these , than I have ever used in my life
Fun Fact: If your friend invites you to a 7 star raid, you can join even with no badges :D
This video makes me sad since I now have an adult job with no self control over what id buy 😂
This was so sweet <3
It kind of feels weird to me that listening to Alpharad say that, despite all the hardship he's went through, he feels happy with his life, made me actually feel happy. But I genuinely feel glad that happened
Wth that was so wholesome im also crying lol
I am passing through the same phase you mentionned alpharad im a 23 engineering student , I felt those words very deeply everything you said is true I hope i'll get to be happy one day like you are now
“GOD!, Look at this addiction, isn’t it beautiful?” Best funny phrase ever heard
Why did this video legit make me cry and start thinking about EVERYTHING 😭😭 Alpharad you’re so freaking cool and it’s awesome how much you love your friends
Maybe your most emotional video, and maybe my new favorite of yours. Hoping to go to Japan one day and experience what you did!
After your last video (a fan game) I am surprised
11:14 i see you Jacob
Can confirm, McDonalds in Japan is actually fantastic, those spicy chicken nuggets go crazy
I did it mom! I technically made it in an Alpharad video (one of my chat’s was in a Jo clip)! I hope this doesn’t make me fly to close to the sun.
What a good kiss.😊
This feels like how my trip to Japan went but high budget edition
Did I see Ohara???
The snoopy plush is a legendary gift
It's crazy how a ton of youtubers I watch all went to Japan this summer, and actually around the same time that I went up with my friends!!
Omg during the unboxing part i was smiling so much. Jacob, although he may not show it in the best ways, actually cares about his friends, and i think that this is really freaking wholesome.
Seeing this video is really cool because I visited japan for the first time around the same time you did, and experienced a lot of the same things, but unfortunatly i have to dislike due to the slander of norwegian McDonalds. I hope you understand.  (edit) I reached the halfwaypoint and now I'm dissapointed in myself. I changed it to a like👍
I love the detail in the thumbnail of zoro being lost on the other side of what I'm going to guess is shibuya
Is no one gunna talk about that last clip at the end of day 4
5:25 when I tell you I got JUMPSCARED by poppy play time
What kind of Newports did they have in Japan?
Release the drunk karaoke footage, I NEED to hear Jan’s singing voice
11:14 👀
wait a damn minute, if you put our mcdonalds in d tier, and i really enjoy mcdonalds, what kind of heaven are y'all havin'??
ok but jacob being called sanji by a little kid is the cutest shit. i dont even watch/read one piece.
Must be nice to be filthy rich
Why do I have a strange desire now to see alpharad cosplay as sanji
this video summarizes my dream, having an awesome group of friends and spending a lot of money in japan with them
The ending of this video, starting with your very open and personal reflection, brightened my horrible day. Thank you. ❤️
I'm really glad you had fun in Japan and that you're feeling happy! I also really liked your shirt in the second half, it made me think of the TV show All That!
I might be one of the few people to be able to do this so... ACTCHUALLY, in Path to The Peak, Eva does NOT go undefeated. She loses the International Championship in the Finals and THEN wins at Worlds.🤓
Bruh, I came here to watch sick financially-irresponsible flexes not to feel genuine emotions such as happiness, warmth and "the fuzzies".  Wholesome video, you're a great dude, Jacob.
I didn't think a video about spending large amounts of money on buying merch would make me cry so much 😢 Seeing everyone's reactions absolutely melted my heart ❤
Pleasssss make more content like this
Oh, so you're like,,, Competitively bisexual
I legit starting tearing up when all of Alpharad's friends opened up the gifts they got. It's so fucking wholesome.
Same man. Same man. All on Thrift Shops haha.  139k views 2 hours ago
Jan and Jacob really do be doing enemies to lovers.
Mother f'er really got the biggest sponsorship on youtube
Now I have to know what Eric got if he couldn’t show it on stream.
This video made me realise how fucked I would be if I went to Japan, and I got nowhere near any YouTuber money so I’d be even more ruined
I just realised ive been here for 7 years, i can remember the "not" series and it was such a nice time
What did he give point crow
from rivals to lovers lol
8:05 I mean... at least he looks happy, with that little ^.^ face or, I guess in the case of a magnemite, ^
Who would've guessed that a little Gameboy game based on beetle fighting would've lead up to this. It's insane watching how much it's grown at this point...
Seeing how happy you friends were at your gifts was best part
I could make this vid too but replace Japan with Popeyes
Don't know why but seeing all the friends react to the amazing gifts and stuff hit me hard in the feels. I think its cause it feels similar to how I treat my friends and always seem to spend so much more money they I should on them cause I just love all my friends and want them to be happy. Recently I cant really spend any money at all cause of stuff in my life but seeing this made me really emotional and I started to cry a little cause I just love seeing people share the beautiful friendships they created and surprises to them.
Absolutely loved everything about this video, so glad you had fun Jacob!
Anyone notice 11:14 ?
Casually spoiling one piece for the anime only geezers What an alpha move
Taiwanese here, yes, 7-Eleven is great!
Damn he really bought doubles of a lot of merch cuz i know jacob got some for himself
Though I label myself as a cautious spender in foreign countries (in case you’re wondering, I’ve only been to Canada), I majorly respect you sending your purchases to your friends. At the risk of sounding corny, sharing is caring. Also, you and Jaiden definitely had fun on your Japan trip. I’ve been looking forward to a video like this for a long time❤. Eli out
This was such an epic video
idk if you'll see this in a sea of comments but i'm actually going to tokyo for a week in january and ngl this got me super hyped bc it will be the first time *i've* had a real, extended vacation in a long time too. i know u got paid to go but regardless, your motivations and what u reflected on really resonated with me :)   also, i'm hayden and pixie/cory's friend (and their stream mods) - this isn't the first time i've heard or witnessed how generous and kind u have been to them, along with so many others. it hasn't gone unnoticed! keep being awesome jacob \o/
9:38 CUCURUCHO!!!!!!
I had the biggest, stupidest grin on my face watching your friends open their gifts. Amazing video, so glad you had a good time!
You gotta leak pkmn challenges karaoke
Bro alpha I love u and ur content what an amazing video loved the reactions at the end made me smile the entire video and im super happy you're happier now in life
Alpharad is the best streamer out there, he is truly happy.
11:14 I saw that kiss
Wait, Aussie maccas is S tier?  Holy fuck what garbage do they serve in the US, France or Denmark? Are you okay? Blink twice if you need help.
This is so incredibly wholesome and I'm glad that you found your way through early adulthood and learned to be happy with yourself.
I can't imagine being as successful as you are and ever not being happy being able to do the things that you do
Did he just send pcrow p*rn?
11:14
Life’s a fucking rollercoaster man. I’m glad you got to enjoy your vacation dude, I hope things keep on getting better for you. Im glad to know you’re happy.
I can’t tell you how happy I am for you. Your videos never fail to make me smile.
wow i didn't know that american fast food here in mexico was so high in the tierlist (from your american view)
This is the best video I’ve watched in a really long time the ending warmed my heart 🥹
This was good thanks alpharad, and I’m glad you’re feeling good and being happy. And so glad you gave back to the people who help you obtain that goal. Was really smiling watching you’re friends open gifts it was priceless
What is hatsu mika?
I'm not crying, you're crying 😢   Thank you for that. All love alpharad.
If I had the money and time that Alpha has, the amount of gifts that my friends would be receiving would be insane to the point that they would be worried about my spending habits due to how frugal I normally am.
Gratz Alpharad!
Never thought I'd cry watching an Alpharad video lol
I wish i was able to do things loke this for me and my friends. That is just awesome
alpharad is one of the youtubers of all time
AlphaDAD
You cant just drop Alpha x Jan kissing and leave like that.  You cant do this to us.  No.  Please.
Did anyone else see the kiss
god i wish i had the money to buy egregious amounts of merchandise for my friends
....are we gonna talk about him making out with someone at Karoke
I slowed down the video when he talked about the karaoke.
The fact that he knows every single one of his friends so well, and that he thought about them shows how nice he is,and that he deserves everything he has made.
7:26 if Jacob spent that much on Pokémon. I really want to see how much jaiden spent
Love your videos but we gonna talk about the kiss orr
I don't know how McDonald's in Mexico it's A tier. I'm from Mexico btw
15:04 IS THAT WOLFEYVGC?!
I watched this with a smile on my face the whole time, you deserve the world my friend, thank you so so much for the gifts.
Im literally just so happy and proud of you. Im glad this is your life <33
here in brazil we had the double big mac for a while and also special ones like a cheddar mcmelt version of it and another with thicc ass burguers, but those were ''seasonal event'' things
Jacob we don’t know each other, it’s been a long 8 years since I’ve started watching you, right after you made how to play bowser 101, and it’s been an honor to watch EVERY one of your videos throughout the years on different YouTube accounts. It’s amazing seeing you grow change and improve and I hope that you know that you’ve been an amazing personality for the world to see. Much love from just one of your many fans
Been a fan since the start of the NOT series, glad you’re still happy and grinding content that makes you happy
I absolutely love that you got all your friends gifts. This was an amazing video.  Good job.
SA2 lesssss gooooooo bois
hey Jacob, hope you are having a good week!
Jacob's title of Biggest Slut reigns true as he sluts himself out to every possible storefront that exists in Japan, looks like you guys had fun!!
JAPAN HAUL NEXTT
"How do I tell this to my accountant?" "Gift them all, massive tax write offs" Genius.
Zoro on the wrong side of the thumbnail lmao
UR SO LUCKY I WANNA BE THERE
11:13 O.5 speed we shipping that or not?
I found this channel around the "Not [BLANK]" series and it was so fun seeing the channel grow from there I'm glad to have found this channel and stayed for the ride  Thank you, Jacob alpharad
Can we all pray for Alpharad’s wallet
So happy you had such a good time Jacob!! You deserve it!! (Also as a CDawgVA fan, CDawgVA spotted)
Alpharad kinda looks like a gay man who identifies as a lesbian
11:14 🤏  lemme just *happy dance*
11:14 I BEG YOUR PARDON
11:23 HE SAID THE LINE 😮
I wasnt ready to cry at funny over spending moment😭
1072 is a great episode
nice
@6:16 I didn't know he was a giant!!!!! On the bright side, you have the money for 5yrs of therapy? That's more than what most ppl can say lol :) Damn he has a lot of friends >_> I guess this is the good part of having hardly any friends, you have to buy less presents lolololololol
Welp this is the best thing ever
So um alpharad kissing someone 11:14 note* this is not the exact frame but you can find it spamming pause and unpause
JACOB IS HAPPY SO I AM HAPPY!
Least favorite thing about worlds is how they did the raffle for all the tickets
Your bond with Jan is so wholesomely platonic, and it's made clear by that moment you two shared in that Karaoke room. Can't wait for the Enemies to Lovers Arc I've been envisioning!
how bad was the dutch mcdonald to be C tier ?
Room vacuum cleaner
I've been going through some "adulting" realism in my life in terms of work/relationships and this hit a lot harder than it should have LOL
when alpharad saw how much he spent on the first store, right then and there he knew he needed to make a video to pay for the loot.
Tax write off the video
Dude flashes in a video of him making out with Jan in a Pokémon sponsorship
We love you Jacob. Very touching words, and I loved the ending bit <3
I never thought id cry watching your videos but here i am in tears at the ending 😭 that is genuinely one of if not the sweetest thing i will ever see someone do for their friends that was so wholesome
never thought an alpharad video would have be bawlin but here we are
I'm not the only one who noticed that he's dubbing himself 👁️👁️
Jacob pls do a game show with all your friends! Super niche anime and game questions!
A
14:16 HES TOO LUCKY!! HE SAW *THE* EPISODE LIVE HEHDJEOJF
Pointcrow not being able to show what he got is hilarious
Man ain't you rich? Enjoy your wealth and don't invest it into your future holdings like a responsible adult, you can always make more... right?
you get one manly tear from me, impressive work soldier
❤️
Seeing his friends open the gift almost brought me to tear because you can feel the joy all of his friends felt and keep making great content.
Wholesome
20:42 damn I can't relate at all  I'm truly happy for you to be able to have such a good life Jacob keep it up
I think this will probably go down as my favourite Alpharad video ever, it may not be the best in the way it doesn't have this insane amount of planning or incredible editing to the hypest moments imaginable, but it will easily be a favourite of mine forever  Him opening up about his journey to now and the insight into his life is touching, and even just imagining having the ability to do something like he did in giving incredible gifts to the people that make his life truly worthwhile is honestly so hearttouching and beautiful. It's a message from the silly little internet funnyman to cherish what you hold dear and it really does make me wanna work harder to achieve something similar to where I can do even the smallest things to show appreciation to the people who make me, me  Even if he never sees this message, one section of a video sponsored by his favourite game franchise is inspiring to a level I can only begin to express in words and it really did get me to tear up. Thank you for all you do to supply strangers on the web with some funky brain chemicals because stuff like this really does make me wanna follow in his footsteps and live to the fullest, thank you Alpha ❤
Damn Alpha you need to stay Sanji spec with the blonde. MrBeast looking head ass
Spicy Bacon Potato Pie?! I should go to Japan.
I LOVE PLACE JAPAN.
15:29 wait is this ohara wtfff
I wish I could go to Japan! that'd be really nice! I also need the money to go onto that trip...
congrats to pchal
This is the most insane ive ever seen alpha with money and I fully support
Karaoke night went HARD
sanji san
I witnessed a lot of people say they are happy just to be.. gone. Take care, your videos mean a lot to me, so do you :)
Jacob is the friend that I want to be.
The end of this video almost made me fucking cry 😭
That was the first time in a long time I've gotten choked up while watching a video. Being able to finally say that you're happy made me happy, and you being in a position to be able to give back to your friends is something I dream of. You are truly an inspiration to me, as I'm sure you are to many others as well. Thank you for everything you do :)
wholesome philosophy jumpscare!
Sanji-San is a compliment!
11:14 enemies to lovers win
This turned out so wholesome at the end! I couldn't stop smiling.
You're just such a role model Alpha. As a VERY long time viewer, each of your videos bring so much joy ❤
12:22 BAABUU:) !!!!!!
Let's be honest, I'm glad Alpharad  is feeling happier know, work that happiness!
If someone is calling you a foreigner their usually saying something on the lines of gaijin
Wait, when TF you came to my country Costa Rica? 😂
Knowing his content, I was expecting a bunch of tax write off jokes. But this is even better!
This was cool. I enjoyed everything and it was amazing to see more of Jacob being an amazing person and friend.
Oh I was having a shitty ass mental breakdown but after that end bit I'm smiling like a dumbass
Wow so wholesome, nothing warms the heart like, poor financial decisions.
The little sentimental personal part in the middle was very wholesome and i feel like it was good to include.  Im glad you enjoy doing what you do and im glad youre able to take time off every now and then. After all mental health always comes first! So if you ever want to take time off, you absolutely deserve it because of all the dedication and hard work you put into this all. Your videos are always a pleasure to watch and i hope you keep having fun creating them for us! Thank you!
11:14
Japan is white peoples wakanda
The wholesomeness got my allergies acting up
This is like when a casino comps you a room so that you waste all of your money gambling. But it’s pokeymon.
The freeze frame of Jacob kissing a guy(who i cannot see the face of but i think is altrive idk) is the highlight of my day
I love the last part of the video. It was so wholesome. Anyways time to go watch Small Ant’s video of him torturing Alpha in a Pokémon escape room
Spending a bunch of money to buy your friends stuff they love is exactly what I'd love to do if I had the money. So wholesome. Glad you had fun!
11:14 hmmmmmmm…
11:13 Wait a second
alpha wtf 11:14
Seeing happy people in both yourself and other people is what we all love to see
“I just want you to know, I’m happy.” That made my heart melt. And it’s weird saying that, as we’re both complete strangers to one another. I don’t know you, Jacob, have never met you nor ever will and vice versa. But I do know alpharad. I’ve been watching alpharad for about 5 years now. And watching him makes me happy, I love his content and his humour and interests. So knowing that Jacob, the person behind alpharad, is feeling better about his life, about the way he feels and the content he gives to us, makes me happy too. I’m glad you’re doing okay, and I hope you continue exploring new experiences to keep it that way. - from a complete stranger
This has to be ome of my favorite alpharad videos ever.
I smell a tax write off
damn, I was really hoping to see PChall get his plushy Trubbish
This video genuinely moved me. As an Alpharad fan from 2015 and knowing the journey hes through from that time to now has moved me to tears. Cheers mate
genius way to write off so much of that expense
The ending got me cryinggg
11:14 Well, Alpharad lived up to a bunch of the nominations he got in that award show video
im in the same boat tbh i spent 50 bucks on crane games
Trying to sneak 11:13 by us lol
karaoke goin hard damn
That split second shot of Jacob and Pokechal kissing made me cackle
Video so sweet I got type 4 diabetes
I am pretty sure alpha has multiple warehouses full of merchandise and he spent 20k on merchandise 💀
My friend was here, if not STILL here not too long ago.
ohh yea, this is goin in the comfort playlist
What was that at 11:14
11:14. That is all.
Are we just gonna skip over 11:15?
11:14 😳📸
Did bro not get the toy at McDonald’s?
he does kinda look like sanji though cant lie
That was amazing to watch, honest to goodness top tier people being top tier pals giving top tier gifts
11:14 👀
did I just see jacob and jan making out?
I hope to see you in Hawaii Alpharad!!! 😊
I am dying 11:14
I read a comment on the inescapable escape room video I think, it said that alpha has to be the best friend one could ask for if they allowed him to put them through so much bullcrap. Now we know he is.
expensive merch, ... but worth it
This makes me so happy, I’ve been watching this channel for what feels like forever at this point the first video I watched was the chao garden one like 6+ years ago and during that time I’ve gone through the ringer middle school pandemic and now highschool and this has continued to be my support and the fact that he has found his happiness makes me more happy than I ever thought possible, alpharad if you see this please live as happily as you can and continue being you.
11:14?
Trade offer: Pokémon gives Jacob: a trip to Japan and a fun experience Jacob gives Pokémon: a sponsorship promotion and several thousand dollars from Pokémon merch
14:35 I love the Mew reference in Pokemon Unite. The pain, oh the pain
Congrats, Jacob. Japan is wonderful, great that you enjoyed your trip. You deserve all the happiness in the world.
Wolfieeeeeee
Based
Jacob you do look like sanji
The Pokemon Company is smart for flying out creators, since lucky/upstart/long time creators make money quite well, then present them with lots of merchandise for them to buy 😏
Love your content man, I'm happy you had an actual vacation and fun with friends where you wanted to be🫶❤️
wish I could like a video thrice, this was so wonderful to watch to the end
Netherlands McDonalds a C, where have you defined this. Groetjes uit Nederland 😊
and nobody talks about how Jacob kissed Jan? i get it sad emotional yadda yadda but like IM HERE FOR THE G@Y SHIT XD
I went to Japan and got beat up by a man in a Kanna costume. We are not the same.
This made me cry man 😭
22:13 very wholesome
Sweetest ending possible
The only thing I’m taking away from this video is how many tattoos Jaden now has like I feel like I missed some thing I knew she had a couple, but damn girl get it✨
As someone from the netherlands, i might have to try mcdonalds in a different country sometime. I just assumed all mcdonalds was equally trash
Yo aus number 1 for Maccas let’s go
YOOO WHAT
actually how do you spend 17k on merch 💀
this is the most video ever 🛴🛴🛴
I cannot express with words this video is incredible
i never expected this to be a deep video but im glad it was especially at the time it is rn  but thank you for making this video I'm glad youre feelng happy :)
This video is amazing
Is the cure to male depression end stage capitalism?
He does look like Sanji and loves food in this entire video.
I wasn't expecting this video to be so sweet
Yay, Jaiden appearances! Can’t wait to hear her story!
A Pokémon show where they play Pokémon cards like yugioh is the most epic thing I’ve ever seen
CDawg and Alpharad crane game competition tease??
We love you sanji
Last chapter literally made me cry. One of the best joys in life is making your friends/family happy. Jacob you are an amazing friend and person 💙
The jan and alpha moment 😭😭
The end of this video fills me with so much joy and even hope. I'm not in a great place right now and haven't been for years; I've been slowly getting better but keep feeling like I've fallen back down after some progress so it's like I never moved at all. But *this* is a future I'd want. To be able to vacation, to be able to bring smiles to my own friends' faces, and to finally get to a place where I'm just *happy.* I haven't had a goal in a very long time, but I feel like this has helped me realize just what I want to do. Even if you never read this, thank you, Alpharad.
I went to Japan for the first time as well back in March. And the first thing we did after getting out of the airport was ALSO McDonalds. Can confirm, it's pretty damn good.
Cheers lad. Hope that you'll enjoy yourself for years to come and take more well earned vacations.
Christmas came real early at the end!  Pretty crazy to think how far this channel - actually, no - how far Jacob's come. I wasn't there at the start but I remember watching his Smash videos maybe a year (give or take) before Ultimate came out. That was 6-7 years ago. And it's kinda nuts how big this has grown since then. When he first started posting non video games videos, I wasn't entirely sure if I was gonna like where the channel was headed but, lo and behold, I was lucky to not miss out after all. I even remember the first Jaiden Animations video he appeared in, where I realised that 2 of my favourite youtubers were all of a sudden best friends. Surprises are fun like that, huh. Well, here's to much more of doing your thing, Alpharad 🥂
11:14  bro tried to sneak this in here
22:15 omori
So what you're saying at the end is retail therapy works...............
11:14 the friends to lovers arc i never thought would become real
The videos of people going to Japan I watch THE MORE I WANT TO GO TO JAPAN STOP IT.
15:30 CdawgVA jumpsacre
I could see you pulling off a sanji cosplay
Why did pokemon partner with you
Going to japan or a new place usually brings joy. Especially when all the new stuff is there. Want to travel alone again and go in a shopping spree. Wallet has been light tho...  Great video alpha!
You are just a very awesome youtuber I mean I love your personality your content and just the way you are . For me you are like a sunshine on YouTube and thank you for that :)
This is exactly the kind of immaculate editing I expect from a college drop out /j
SAME!
11:14
Minor thing, the Jan kiss popped off for real
this video hit me like a truck emotionally  having known you for nearly a decade and seeing your journey from the very start, hearing you genuinely say out loud that you're happy brought a tear to my eye :')  so much love for you man, and I cannot articulate how thankful I am for the gifts. You truly are one of the most generous and kind people i've ever met 💜
And Day 5 五日
First alpharad video that made me cry. Genuinely love this dude with all my heart and am so glad with how well he’s doing
Is it bad that after the heartfelt talk about happiness I thought you would plug an advertisement for some therapy service?
11:14
Broo i started tearing once i saw hat he got EVERYTHING for SOOOO much of his friends even if it cost a fortune. It just shows how much they mean to him ESPECIALLY with all of their favorite things. <3
God damn it Jacob.
11:13 DID I SEE THAT RIGHT 😱
Seeing pointcrow frantically screaming “I can’t show this on stream” is hilarious.
Give them way too many gifts. brilliant.
... We need context at 11:14 o.o
Why is Hawaii ill tied?
Im so glad you got this vacation alpha. Ive been following you since the story for glory days (yes, that ancient series) and youve always put up a positive and upbeat personality. It looks like youre taking more rime to soend as jacob, rather than alpharad, and i think its for the best. Keep doing you, and iook forward to the next video from this internet funny-man
I always worry how are youtubers doing behind the scenes because well... we dont know. Glad to hear you are happy nowadays
Probably everything at that pop up store can be sold for like double the price so every purchase made there can technically count as an investment
You cant just slip in a frame of you and Jan kissing with no explanation
Favorite YouTuber strikes again
I don’t usually watch vlogs, but I’m really glad I decided to watch this one. What a heartwarming video, thanks for everything Jacob
The kid at the shonen jump store really called him sanji
Omg the ending of this video made me tear it, it was so wholesome
This was a really nice video. Its always good to see creators who make so much stuff I like be happy. And hearing what Jacob has been feeling he really deserves it. I went to Japan recently and despite all the memes, the 'place, japan' phenomenon is real. Japan is a place I highly reccomend going for anyone, weeb or not. I went with my family and we all had an amazing time.
I was in japan for a month and was hopping to see you and Jaiden there. I believe my last week in japan was your first week. I bought a lot of stuff bot not 8 suitcases worth 😂
Enjoy your life to the fullest and be happy.
Bruuuuh that final chapter 😭 thats soooo dope!!
out of the lope what happened in hawaii
Was your accountant jaiden animations
11:14 Crazy nigth uh?
Goo goo ga ga I want milk
It’s so awesome that Pokémon just straight up sponsored this dude
Man... you're so insanely lucky. Ive been saving for seven years to take a trip to Japan. Then I lost my job and had to use all of that to pay for rent/moving. I don't know if I'll ever be able to visit in my entire life
Japan is truly peaceful. Even thought me and my friends caused a few things
Antatica
Save some woman for us!
Tanakas amazing commodities theme 😂 when shopping 🔥😩
11:14 glad they made it this far
The more videos I see about Japan the more I imagine what it would be like if other places were like it
The ending was so amazing and I loved it but I’m just wondering what Pointcrow got that he could not show on stream.
that’s gotta be the single sweetest ending to a youtube video i’ve ever seen. i’ve been watching since 2015 myself, and it’s been such a crazy ride seeing your growth as a creator but more importantly as a person. i always find myself looking forward to ever project you create, and it’s been so fun to see you and your friends take part in them together. the last few minutes had me tearing up, such a beautiful gesture and i was just so happy watching it man. i’ll forever be a fan and i wish you nothing but more happy memories going forward💙💙💙
can't state enough how much i loved this video💚💚💚
This video made me start bawling by the end. You are the most amazing person, and I hope you really get to live your life to the absolute fullest.
I think the gifts moments at the end but I'm honestly loved that Alpharad had the little emotional reveal that he's been a whole lot happier now that he's been focusing on his own happiness, slowing down with making videos, and spending time with friends instead of constantly being on the nonstop content grind.
5:24 OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG
Thank you for doing this. We appreciate your work, and are happy that you are and were able to step away from it. Enjoy your life and thank you.
THIS IS SOME WHOLESOME IM GONNA CRY❤❤❤
Goddamn. Bro spent enough money to get a good used car just for his friends. Good on you, brother.
Only thing i took away from this was you have been to norway and sweden?? Huh? When?
More than anything, I'm glad you're healthier. ❤
Ah hell nah bruh, alcohol done made Alpharad and Jan gay
very wholesome great video!
YOOOOOOO METAVERSE CAMEO
11:13 gotta love dudes being bros ^^
Thanks Alpharad, for the years of glorious content. Godspeed you dilligent man.
As a fan who’s been following since 2015, I want to say that I’m proud of you and what you’ve become. You’ve done and made a lot of memories, for yourself and others.  I appreciate your work and just want to say thank you
lmao, actually laughed at the ad read, idk it was just funny to hear someone talking about a massive franchise like pokemon as if it were raid shadow legends
Honestly, the goat and the best human being this world can ever have, love you Jacob❤️
They earned more from this than they spent getting jacob there, haha (please help, I got an addiction again nooooo)
This is one of my favorite alpharad vidoes just because of how wholesome it is.
That ending was so nice and thoughtful, and I'm happy you got to go to Japan and have a truly one in a lifetime experience. I've been Subscribed to you since 2017 and So proud of how far you've come, and You're one of the many inspirations for me to become a YouTuber, I hope one day we can collab on something but I just want to say thank you so much for entertaining not only me, but everyone on this platform.  There have been some days where I felt meh, or had some really rough patches, but your content really helped put a smile on my face. Keep making the videos you want to make, and have fun. Happy for you dude ^^.
This video made me flood with envy  I just notice one of his freinds got a rowlet plush and fucking hell I require that. Now. Also lol point crow couldn’t show his shit  Update: I went to Japan and got both that exact plush and a better one so I’m happy now
This video proves my point, Jacob is my favorite person on earth, even when he’s wasting money he does it for his friends. His cause is just.
Man Alpharad honestly that ending impacted me a lot. I'm glad you're open about your journey to get where you are now and  have found happiness! Giving back to all of your friends is such a kind  thing to do as well. So happy you’ve found yourself
....Did you upload a video where in just one frame you were kissing (i think the long haired guy) in the karaoke bar while being drunk?! hahahahaha Damn you Bi-bro!!! that was wholesome hahahaha
One of the happiest videos I’ve ever seen  A pure genuine smile across my face seeing this man and many others happy
This def is one of the best moments on the channel.
That was so wholesome I cried a little
One of your editors is a close friend of mine. When she opened her box, it was one of the happiest I've seen her be. Thanks for allowing her to edit for you. She has been having a great time :>
im so sad i had my trip way after this happened man i would have probably returned home broke from all that merch, and thats coming from someone who already spent too much at 3 different pokecentres, 2 were on the same day
Such a heart-warming video, glad you had a great time with everyone on your holiday!
im literally in a plane to japan right now
Tax right off?
Imagine having to be a Pokemon bootlicker in 2023. How pathetic
ALPHARAD YOU LUCKY GUY!! I would’ve spent all of my money on day one.
alpharad called sanji by a small japanese child is honestly the best part of this entire video
Quick make out sesh at 11:14 with PC, Kinda kinky ngl
Nice
This video was a masterpiece because I’ve been to Japan multiple times and Jacob experiencing what I did the first time I went was really cool
Growing up with ur channel has been insane, going from s pokemon sun in 20 mins to ace of hearts to this has been amazing every step of the way.
Bro one of my favorite videos by far, it's amazing, funny and so cute in the end, your awesome alpharad your videos always make my day thank you⭐️
Damn the end of this video was so wholesome 😄
This is the most wholesome ending to an alpharad vid and I kinda almost started crying ngl
Alpharad, your a really wholesome guy. An amazing character of a person at your core. Thank you for every effort you put into your videos. Stay rad, Alpharad 😎
I was just in Tokyo back in May. I got so much stuff at the pokemon centers, I also brought a full empty suitcase for souveniers. Wish I could have gotten more though
All in all I’d say this experience was wholesome
This has to be one of my favorite videos to date, this was so wholesome 🥹
im speechless.
2:44
5:43/9:38 CUCURUCHO
did he just persona (5)
Nice flexing on us with your Tumi luggage Jacob
WHen you are on vacation and spend money in a foreign currency it doesn't feel real until you come home and see your credit line
They invited alpharad and Jaiden. Pokémon knew they would make their money back on mercy alone.
You focused the camera on the cartoon Kobe statue but for a split second I saw Alexander the Warrior Jar's elbow, and I wish you let us see more of him.
Having lived in Japan for a year I can confirm that 7/11 is a godsend. I paid my rent there.
alpharad is the equivalent of the sad man with a moth flying out of his pocket
Alpharad Sanji Cosplay when?
Hey Jacob, play Pokemon Inclement Emerald. It's my favorite rom hack and pokemon game literally ever and I think it's right up your alley. Think OrAs on crack with pokemon all the way up to gen 7 (soon to be 8 and 9 too) abilities, and a rebalanced version of every pokemon. Few things were left unchanged for the better.
Ok, 2 minutes in I hear that seven eleven is reveried as a holy place, then they have those “magazines?!”
You do look like him.
Check at 11:14 and thank me later
Costa Rica b tier wtf
Parasocial relationships and pretence of the online persona and whatnot, I really hope what you said here is at least somewhat genuine. The video just raidates SO MUCH joy for life and honestly? Good on you man, I'm happy for you
Man I understand that feeling. I would buy everything origami and design paper.
This whole vids reminds me of when I was in Japan and went HAM at the Tokyo Pokemon DX store and Akihabara lol  Also the little kid calling you Sanji-san made me lose it
Wholesome
i didn’t realize how tatted Jaiden was 😭🫶🏽
This guy is amazing
This video is what I needed. That personal part wasn't necessary, but it is very helpful and reassuring of life. So thank you for that!
pfff sometimes i forget that alpharad is bi 11:13
damn I teard up at the end dude 😭 jacob is SUCH a real one man what a legend great content creator and generally good guy
Im glad you could go to japan sanji keep up the good work
Just hearing Alpha say "I'm happy" really made my day. Thanks for being there for your friends and fans Jacob!
Happy 10 years of youtube sanji-san!
Alpharad is Sanji now, it’s canon
11:14 is crazy
amazing
That was incredibly wholesome
11:14 i saw that
<3
Ok but, as a clay person, who also likes pokemon, that magnemite bit is genuinely the coolest part of this to me. Like, it's objectively not the coolest part, and yet it is.
Its so awesome that you've found your happiness Alpharad. Now I can enjoy your uploads guilt free, knowing that anything you put out these days is something you wanted to make! Also, absolutely incredible what you were able to do for your friends. Im sure you didnt have to spend that much to show them how much they mean to you, but the level of individuality in the gifts was perfect. The GOAT.
don't worry jacob alpharad. a few ad reads will probably cover the massive merch hauls.
Everyone: Rushes to the comments to joke about spending Everyone after the ending: Perhaps I treated you to harshly  You are an amazing friend for that
bro spent my income per annum
HATSUNE MIKU HERO IS SO GOODDDDD
Jacob! I joined you only recently but I love your content and I’m sure everyone is happy for you!
Fuck yeah, Alpha became our grandmas on Christmas
the seven 11 keyblade man. They really made one
11:14 AYO ALPHARAD...- CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS??
Holy shit that ending hit me man, keep doing your shit Alpharad, you truly are one of the good ones
11:14 we saw that.. 😳
11:14 AYO
Why is no one bringing up the fact that Jacob made out with Jan at 11:14? lol
And you said you weren’t a Pokétuber
To be fair, the Japanese fast food chains are really different.
I kind of teared up at the end there. Seeing you really open up about your mental health like that in front of so many people is brave, and I respect you for doing that. Seeing you give back to all of your friends like that was so cool and kind of you. Please never stop making videos, because they are the highlights of my week. You’re the best, internet funny man❤️
Love the last bit but like what did pointcrow get? He just said he couldn’t show it on stream and we never came back to him.
Japan's a nice place to visit. That ending was so sweet!
Cheers buddy.
Yo! This is awesome. Dude you made it! Mr. Pikach himself asked you and paid you to come to the Pokémon World championships. That’s insane. Congrats 🎉
11:14 HELLO!???
The way he put the scottish and brittish flags together on the tier list 😶
We know he got Pointcrow the good stuff from 7-11
Petition for Alpharad to cosplay Sanji
I swear Jacob is one of the most to Down to Earth Content creators
Someone was cutting onions at end 🥲
11:06 HEY. I expect your house to look like a really *high quality* souvenir shop
11:14 there's a single frame of something. That's all I will say.
I’m crying for the end
pokemon having enough power to take over an entire city. So true
Know its mostly a pokemon and japan video but really happy youre doing good Alpharad!
Jacob entered his shibuya ark... i hope he doesnt get sealed there for eternity.. 😅🤦‍♂️😐
You better have gotten major a new plant
We love you Alpha! You've been making amazing content for years and you deserve the world!! I am so glad that you are finding your happiness. You are the kind of person I aspire to be. You had the strength and ability to step back and realize that you weren't living your life fully. You analyzed your life, broke your chains, and are starting something new, something better for you. Love you so much Jacob.
I love this thumbnail so much look at little Zoro being lost 😂
I was not expecting to cry from an alpharad video, oh god
Jaden jump-scare at 1:54
.
Had a wide open grin plastered on my face during the final montage of the video. Wasn't expecting the most wholesome content ever when I opened this video, but I'm so glad I did. Happy to hear you're in a far better place now, and hope you keep finding ways to experience life to the fullest in the days and years to come 💛
1:32 why is there a flag for Scotland and the Union Jack, the Union Jack flag (🇬🇧) represents all countries in the United Kingdom which already includes Scotland, and if you ment England by that the English flag is this right here (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿) It just bothers me so much for some reason when people think that scotland and britian are different places, SCOTLANDS LITERALLY A PART OF BRITIAN (for now anyway)
If you ever need a reminder about how much thought this man puts into everything he does. Every single gift box is personalized so well they all love every single item they get.
I cried. There, i said it, i cried. About how amazing it felt that you said "i'm happy". Genuinely glad you're more than "just okay", hope you're living the best life you can and that it will become better and better, because fuck it if there is one person here deserving it, it's Jacob Alpharad himself. Watching your videos since 2016, you rapidly became one of my favorite content creator (even if i'm french and we have plenty of good content creators in France out there), but I always wondered if you were truly living the life you wanted and deserved. So glad this made you realise what you truly needed from now one.
Ireland McDonalds goes HARD honestly!! love that its so quality here
I didn't see the video yet, but just like to point out that I loved the little touch on the Thumbmail where the straw hats are shopping in one end  and zoro was on the other side, going the opossite direction. Such a little detail that made me smile for a bit.
With the Sanji-san thing, I mean, you're not only blonde, but also have a short brown beard. That's fucking hilarious.
woo hoo Ireland is in a
I don't care if it's in Japan, where they seem to have a higher standard for their food. I'm never, NEVER eating hot food from a gas station ever again.  A hush puppy I didn't even get for myself nearly cost me my life, and I think it permanently fucked up my guts, because I've struggled with all food ever since.
1:31 ordered tiers?
I never thought I see a Pokémon Scarlet/Violet ad read
White man goes to Asia and it changes his world view.   (In all reality, this was an amazing video, and was an amazing story!)
HOW THE FUCK IS THIS THE MOST HEARRWARMING VIDEO ON THIS CHANNEL
this mans is too good at spending money
Cant believe Jacob went to yomama and bought pokemon
I have been playing too much One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 recently and recoiled in confusion when I heard the main theme in this video. It is invading the other parts of my life. 😭
So happy to hear how well you're doing and how far working on yourself (and therapy!) has brought you. You're an inspiration. Hope I'll find myself in the same spot as you one day. Much love ❤️
11:14 👀
I literally just got my Hisuian Decidueye before watching this. Damn....
11:14 😳 bro didn’t need to show that (Watch on 0.25x speed)
Lets be real this video was for tax write offs
6:17, a wild Jan appears!
That was the sweetest ending i have ever seen in my life
I had no clue you were a one piece fan lol
8:15  oh no… (jjk moment)
Holy shit this video has a banger sound track 🔥 Always makes me happy to see Jacob enjoying irl stuff like this, keep it real chief 💪
I actually saw you in McDonald’s in Ireland btw
11:14 Yo my Jan x Alpha fanfic is real             (for legal reasons this is a joke)
11:14 pause fastly. No questions asked
Good guy Jacob, most wholesome content I've ever seen. Thank YOU for almost 10 years of amazing content! Glad you enjoyed your vacation <3
RIP to Alpha's Wallet-san 💸
ummm what happened at the end of day 4🤨
11:15
Oh fuck, you too?
I feel connected to alpha on a personal level. A personal, money wasting level
Seven eleven, family mart, Lawson its all the same. While its super convenient and pretty good, it gets old when you travel around japan and you eat from those places. a lot.
I’m glad you’re doing good hope you continue to make good memories, happy memories.
Ayyy, Sweden is in the S-Tier!!! Let’s go!!!
2:46 We’re is the receipt? 🤨🤨🤨
Not alpha making out with pokemon challenges
I know we have the best maccas
From temu to pokemon… how our boy has grown..
DAMN HE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY At shit there is 18 minutes left
pchal X Alpha canon??
YOO CDAWG
The ending reminds me of the end of the 2011 film tower heist. Good job I appreciate the deepcut
The whole second half of this vid was an amazing set to watch unfold
this such a fun video and a beautiful love letter to alpharad's friends
‘…Pokemon himself…’ making a lot of assumptions there.
Hatsune miku:)
Yup that was definitely a man😀
11:14
26:57 what the amazing Vtuber said
I dont know if this is weird, but congrats Jacob Alpharad, you genuinely made me cry all my makeup off with this video :,)  Everyone's reactions to your generosity was so fucking sweet to watch and as someone who can relate alot to your experiences, hearing you talk about life and just being happy and living how you want to live was so meaningful to me I may not be exactly where I want to be yet, but this video and all the positive energy it radiates makes me certain I'll get there <3
I just lost my mind seeing the .5 sec image of Jacob and Jan at the karaoke and really just went, well that make complete sense. Also this vids made me realized that i could too be unresponsible with money, learning that there is where I live a bandai namco store. Thanks
I was also crying at the end of this video. All of your friends must be the happiest people in the world because they have you by their side.   I wish I had a friend like you are.
I am pretty sure that mare than 50% of your viewers are in a state of happiness and jealousy the human mind could not comprehend
Good to see Jacob Alpharad discovering work/life balance. You deserve it.
The trip looked like an absolute amazing time! And that ending was so wonderful!
I'm glad you've been more fulfilled recently, Jacob. It's shown, and your work has really inspired me. Thanks for going above and beyond.
Bro the new gen one piece lovers is just so awesome tah see. Bro I ain't no pokemon guy but this video went hard. Also bro Jacob so glad your in a good space now
The ending legit had me tearing up. I'm so happy you have such a wonderful group of friends, Jacob.
Honestly, i was insanely facinated by the trip but yknow. That ending definitedly led me to tears. It inspires me indirectly to well, keep going to inspiring and supporting my friends up. This was insanely damn sweet.
thank you Jacob :D
This genuinely makes me happy. I can only one day hope to have a friend as lovely as Jacob. God bless, and may your videos always make y’all smile. Because the lord knows they make me. Also, Colin’s pouch is definitely a pipe bomb :)
1 hour ago
Holy crap alpharad was an hour away from me and I didn’t know :(
Jacob is the kind of person I try to be, literally the biggest role model I have and just someone that keeps me going whenever and wherever, he seems like such a good friend it’s insane
That is the most radical shirt ive ever flocking seen.  I really want one.
YO? 11:10
1:30 jeeze McDonalds must be trash globally if you have Aussie McDonalds in S-tier. Only good thing they've got is the coffee (I'm Australian)
21:53 (wholesome montage of friends happily opening gifts from Jacob) vs. “I CAN’T SHOW THIS ON STREAM”
I got a digimon ad on this video.
The last bit of his friends getting gifts from him is so incredibly sweet and heart warming, it makes me hopeful
0:27 are we getting a sonic adventure 2 video soon? That’s one of my all time favorite games
It is my dream to be able to spoil my loved ones like that one day <3 keep making incredible content!!
damn if i went to a place like this i would spend a lor but not that much, specially not in figurines, i prefer plushies
he cannot just gloss over that karaoke night.
That heart-to-heart really hit home- Alpharad is achieving his dreams dude
Best video 100/10
4:36
Jaiden definitely saw this video and is absolutely buying every single plushie seen in this video
imagine Japanese people finding out that the US has a state called Good Morning 😭
that ending was amazing!! you are a great person alpharad, im glad you are happy :)
When your in a place that pokemon was created, its hard not to spend loads of money lol
I would do the same thing if I could, we ALL get it, respect the flex hahahaha, I’d buy one of everything if I could 🫶🥰
I didn’t not expect to see Jan and Jacob making out today but here we are
Cucurucho.... I can never escape Cucurucho...
The netherlands mcdonalds C tier? well lets cry in the corner
11:14 WHAT?! did i just see ...
man i’ve been watching alpha since CHAO GODFATHER it’s amazing to see how far he’s come
That final chapter was so beautiful. That was very kind of you Jacob❤🔥
Thank you for your content and especially for being open about more serious topics in such an adult and broad way
This started out with me beyond envious, blown away by how cool it all was, only to end extremely wholesome. Love it.
Woah. I didn’t know Sanji had a YouTube channel!
Well played
What’s “ill timed” about them announcing being in Hawaii next year?
I find it funny how none of the comments so far have said anything about how much money he spent
Ive never watched a video more relatable
YOOOO AUSTRALIA IS THE BEST MCDONALDS!! LETS GOOOOO
WholesomeRad is real and its the last half of the video. You really deserve more than just 3 mil.  Also seeing how many people calling Alpha gay causs he made out with Jan is proving they dont know Jacob, he is not gay, he is the imboddiment of gay only when hes drunk
so sick to hear about your journey through the years with content and your mentality with not only content itself, but with the parts of your life it affected. People like you inspire me. Thank you.
Literally popped off when you said you were happy, you’ve been a major influence and inspiration in my life and you just deserve it, plain and simple. <3
Huzzza!
Yo i never knew you were gay!!!!!!!!!!
11:14 You cant hide it Jacob. We know. We see all
Slugma
Try Hong Kong is McDonald’s
Watching you grow in content and as a person over the last 7 years has been amazing. Thank you Alpharad.
king
This one felt special. And ya know what  I'm happy that you were able to find your way to happiness
-Rich person goes to japan for free -Gives free stuff to his rich friends Lol this is content nowadays. Basically Ricegum tbh
Honestly, I wasn't expecting this to get so emotional, and ngl, I'm crying a bit. I'm so incredibly happy for Jacob. I may not know him personally, but his message still hits home.
This one video turned you into my one of my favorite people. I've been watching your vidoes for years, and I always noticed how sad you seemed at times, I could tell it was getting hard to hide those emotions, and finally seeing you get happier as of late made me very happy for you. You deserve the good friends you have, the comfortable financial position you are in and all the happiness you've gained. Thank you, Jacob for being a great person, and thank you for sharing your happiness to the world.
Alpha went from Spending MrBeast levels of money and fangirling every chance he could, to going into a Group Therapy Session
Of course the video where you get sponsored by the pokemon company is the only one that is wholesome xD I wonder why you cant remember your night with pokemon challenges in a few frames before that I wonder what happened xD
"Japan is like fortnite"
I didnt expected this video to make me tear a little, i expected Jacob pointing at shibuya and going LOOK GUYS PERSONA 5 REAL!!! but that whole second part of the video just made me so emotional. I have been here for years now, followed all your projects, and its just so emotional for me seeing you say out loud things that you usually tend to talk just a tiny bit in other places outside the main channel. Im really happy we got to see Jacob, the man behind Alpharad for this video.
The title is a really nice touch with the one piece and as a fan of one piece I found it very funny that Zoro was lost from the group😂
19:03 I'm the complete opposite nowadays
Wholesome ending! Keep it up king!
Thank you so much for making this video. You have become much more than a YouTube funny man.
The most jealousy I got was seeing all those Pyra/Mythra amiibo, not gonna lie
"M" in money should not be capitalized.
Made it to A tier baby
This man is a legend
proud of jacob alpharad for having a revelation about his life or smth by spending copious amounts of money on anime merchandise
That was nice
What music was used in this video?
Were those eevee bags  Does anyone know if they sell those by themselves
I love when multimillionaires pretend they are making bad financial decisions when spending insignificant amounts of money to them
That was so heartwarming
Jacobs journey in Japan looks so sick and it looked like an amazing time.
Is that OHara the one piece theory guy 15:30
Very proud of alpharad for not clickbaiting with Jaiden in the title, only in the description
Time to shill for those prime subs
The main reason why this channel is my favorite is because I've been able to see it grow since its early days. Even tho it has changed so much through the years, it's been awesome seeing it grow and has brought me so much joy  Shine Get brings back so many great memories. Can't believe it's been almost ten years...  Thanks for all the experiences, I'm glad I bring some support to such an big inspiration of mine
I just want to imagine how much Jaiden spend.......🤔🤔
Alpharad really out here spending 5 days in my dream vacation area and I think I got a big smile just watching it all unfold and it makes me really excited to visit Japan for myself, I can't wait to share this experience with my close friends.
Alpharad living our dreams Fr, now to try to accomplish it myself.
6:15 You Said The Magic School Bus  🤣
I can't believe it. This is just like my favourite game Persona 5! I can't believe they made the areas from the game into a real place!
Bro single handedly gave pokemon enough revenue for a new game lmfao
That trip looks like a hole in my pocket too lmao
heard the word "shibuya" and had a 30 minute mental breakdown from jjk
The showcase at the end is honestly the dream of what I want to be able to do for my own friends. I was grinning the whole time at all the excited faces and wonder. That's such an awesome thing to do for someone.
11:13 ??? lmfao
How odd, I suddenly developed an unquenchable thirst for buying Nintendo products.
that made me happy
i have a trip to japan in april and this video made me want to buy the entire merch of everything but i dont think my family will ever recover financially
I know it was a hard path but I’m glad your living a life you can enjoy now
LAX is like 23 minutes usually sometimes 40 it’s not that bad
I can't believe its been 10 years and that Alpha started in his first year of college and I haven't been here for the whole thing but its wild watching this while I'm a freshman in college right where he began and I'm very glad thay you've come to be so happy with your life alpha  Edit: unrelated but if alpha sees this I would love some more of "how did we get here" or more ace of hearts, I love all forms of the content he has made over the years, what a brilliant man
You really thought that we wouldn’t notice that half a frame of you and Pokemon Challenges making out 😅
I just can't take the face of Jaiden at 9:40 realizing she has made that beautiful new hyperfixation.
Thanks Alpharad for making my poor financial decisions look actually good.
W vid lol I want to make a cringe argument comment but I people are actually smart so I didnt
Smart move Pokémon, you found a good way to make money XD
I’ve been subbed for a while, Jacob. Hearing the entire second half of the video almost made me cry. I’m so happy you’re in a better place mentally and what you did for your friends/team was really sweet.  Peace and love 😎✌☮❤🥦🌟🎵🎶🦏
1:31 Great Britain is not a country, it’s the union of England, Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.
25:05  Fyrus, my man! The cyndaquil line is my favorite, and i definitely need that plush
Honestly Alpharad talking about his struggles and the finally saying he is happy hit hard. Hopefully we all get there one day. Alpharad you make awesome content and I hope you stay happy man
I am going to use a quote from JJK. " Sukuna lived for his pleasure and displeasure" He is satisfied and lives how he wants. So Jacob. Relax and live how you want my guy
My wallet hurts. But i love it! ALSO at 11:13 i SEE YOU... omg why was the ending so sweet
It's always good to see when creators you watch are genuinely amazing humans
I was smiling throughout the entire ending of the video.
14:36  I don't either, but it's probably easier to understand than what I'm used to.  Honestly, for a second I was thinking about how cool it would be to go to a card game shop in Japan and get Yu-Gi-Oh cards, then I remembered that doing so would be near worthless because Komoney doesn't let us in the TCG use OCG cards.  Their reason. They've never directly said this, because of legal reasons or whatever, but it's very clearly because letting us use OCG cards would destroy the second hand market of TCG cards.  Long story short, the OCG prints cards in more rarities making them more affordable for people with less money. The TCG doesn't.  Well, not quite. They recently added a new rarity that does help a bit, and so far it seems to be working decently well.  Unchained soul Lord of Yama would've probably been a $40-ish card, but the it's closer to $20 because anyone who wants max rarity can pick up a quarter century secret are for around $130-$160.  It's not a great example, but it's the best example that I have. Not much else in DUNE was that influential. We'll probably (maybe) have a better reference point moving into AGOV.
So sweet. Bless the homies.
The ending made me tear up...10/10...keep up the amazing work Jacob! And stay happy! Your friends are lucky to have met you!
Love you Jacob, hope you stay this way, is nice seeing you that happy and relax.
1:29 Fun fact about Mcdonalds japan. they have a menu item called adult cream pie
You know what... I think that kid had something, you do kind of look like a budget Sanji
Alpharad, I hear your plea, I will bravely accept your wealth to help you with your spending, you won’t have to worry about the money, it’ll be gone from the both of us so no more money!! 😂😂
I doubt anyone's going to notice, but in the thumbnail you can see the Straw Hats in the background walking to the left, while on the other side, to the right, you can see Zoro alone and confused because he always gets lost. Props to whoever designs these for that attention to detail.
I cried during the friend gifting session and I don't really know why. Just congrats on everything you've been able to achieve with this channel.
I came to watch haha funny wallet dead.  Left with the most beautiful understanding of friendship and happy. God damn. I'm gonna call my freinds.
This is the LAST video I would have thought would bring an emotional tear to my eye 🥹   I’m happy you’re in such a good place, Jacob. Personally, I mean. Japan too, but whatever 😅
What a beautiful video this was, the ending was so touching. When I first found this channel a few years ago, I was just laughing along with every forward aerial. Alpharads videos had helped me thru some hard times and I always get excited to a new upload in my subscription box because of the amount of effort that Jacob puts in his videos. Thank you so much for making content Jacob
he do look like sanji tho
is alpharad geyyyyyyyyyyyyy ???
Just the joy of all your friends opening their gifts is so sweet. I hope one day I get to go to Japan and see all its beauty
This video made me so happy, just watching funny internet man having fun and taking a break after entertaining us for so many years, I've been a fan since 2017 and watched the channel grow and grow, alphadad just kept pumping out content, and even when he was a part of fwob and the various other channels he uploaded and never stopped, glad he got to take some time for himself, thank you alpha, its crazy thinking how I started watching you when I was 14, IM 20 NOW. like you never stopped entertaining, THANK YOU take as many breaks as you need, you deserve it.   EDIT: 2016 holy hell it’s been a ride love you alpha/dad
Okay so when is the merch store relaunching
11:14 IT HAPPENED AGAIN
as someone who relates to you in all the wrong ways and loves all your content, It's awesome to know that you are doing better now! I too have spent the last year focusing more on relationships than on other things that people would deem more important like my grades or work. with my senior year having nearly my worst grades ever, it was well worth it because i finally have 2 people i can call my friends without triggering my RSD for the first time in over a decade. your story gives me hope and you are a real inspiration to my life. Stay strong!  Edit: what would I do next? hug my friends. then spoil them in gifts (as if one of my friends hasnt cleared their steam wishlist to stop me from buying them shit LOL) (oh shit you just did that) uhhhh then I hug them more try to be a better friend give them money
Rich YouTuber spends unneeded money on expensive trip. Gamers everywhere press F on world's smallest keyboard.
everytime you said yokohama i remember what's happening in bungou stray dogs and i don't know what that says about me
I mean... japan sure is like fortnite
Mr. Alpharad I just want to say that your content has helped me through a lot. From your Smash 4 videos with Travis to Plus/Deluxe/Gold with Jo and Dash, your videos have made me laugh and put smiles on my face when I most needed them. Frozen In Time made me realize I wasn't feeling fulfilled in the relationship I was in at the time it released, and now I'm in a relationship where I don't resonate with those words anymore and it's a great feeling. So thank you for and congrats to nearly 10 years of putting yourself on this platform and just being a funnyman.
i can already tell native hawaiians are gonna HATE that it's in hawaii
I was not expecting such a wholesome ending to the video.
This was a wholesome video and I’m really glad that you’re in a good place right now. I know what it’s like to be in a slump that never seems to end, and the fact that you got out of yours is heartening to hear.
You and your friends are amazing
Dinner with a friend that friend being Aron Cybertron an amazing Pokémon player
Mate, this video caused me to get in tears. Not only would I love to visit Japan, but seeing all your friends reactions to the gift boxes made me tear up heavily. You're such a lovely bloke and your friends are lucky to have you ♥
I remember all those years back watching you as the 'funny smash guy'. The development since then has been insane
This is so awesome!!!!!! Glad you had such an awesome vacation. As someone about to go to Japan for 2 weeks very soon, this is the perfect video to inspire my future poor Pokemon, Miku, and Jump financial decisions
haven’t watched the vid yet but banger thumbnail especially after seeing all of the instagram stories
i did not expect to cry
11:14 You’re  welcome
11:14  your welcome😂
I cried.
5:22 I think that was Jaiden that held you hostage
Everyone opening the packages made me get a little emotional and I can’t really say why.
I have been to japan and holy shit is 7-eleven actually heaven I had their doughnut’s and I came back and bought five more
20:03               AMONGUS
Dope I've been there twice before you were even popular on YouTube
Jacob being mistaken for Sanji by a child is the funniest thing
I mean, it says Honolulu, which isn't Maui, so...
8:14  the Shibuya incident 2023 found footage
I love how the xenoblade soundtrack is appearing in more vidoes
I was not expecting the wholesomeness at the end omg I cried so much. Jacob you're such a good noodle!
This looked incredible and I'm so glad you're doing good. This video is one of your best! Hope you stay this happy for many years to come.
Is it just me or does this feel like a farewell video
As someone who had an early release from High School, I can concur that this is a video of all.
Jacob gotta be top 1 anime characters of all time
The montage at the end is so heartwarming <3
Australia got that S tier maccas
Thank you for this video.  I could say a lot more than that.  But what it all really boils down to is thank you.  I needed to see this right now.
1:22 I'll be in Asia next month, and everyone looks at me weird when I say I'm interested in what the McDonald's have. I need to understand the McDoo  lmao also 7/11
11:14 what happened here alpha?
Alpharad: im aro-ace Also Alpharad: 11:14
The last part was wholesome af 😭
I love that Zoro is lost in the thumbnail
The MOST wholesome twist of all time and I love it!!! 💕💕💕
Alpharad is now snaji
11:14 Not again alpha....
did not expect to get teary eyed clicking on this video
Speaking as a subscriber from near the beginning, it’s inspiring to see how much you’ve evolved. It’s one thing to say you’re a terrific content creator, but it’s another thing to say that you’re a terrific person.  It’s incredible to hear that you’re happy. It’s something so simple, yet so difficult to say for a lot of people. I hope you continue to prosper, and I hope you have a wonderful day!
SO FUNNY TO SAW THE KISS BETWEEN POKEMONCHA AND ALPHARAD OMG
Bro the end soo wholesome
Can we talk about how good of a person Alpha is
When he’s talking about 7 eleven in Japan. I was like OK that’s cool until when he said the “P” word, I was like HUH?!!
Melee mod reference spotted
Can’t believe Sanji one-piece got sponsored by Pokémon
im watching this as my foot its bleeding  this video is relieving the pain thank you
A POPULAR YOUTUBER SAID THEY'RE HAPPY!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!  never thought I'd see the day
Glad to see you're feeling happy and gained a new perspective on life after this vacation. Know that you can always take a break if needed.
jacob is my favorite fucking youtuber and he deserves every single bit of fame and wealth he has
I think everyone can agree this is just a dope ass video
I feel ya, I love Pokémon plushies! 😄
Alpharad, Jacob. I don't know if you are ever gonna see this comment. But my guy? You're gonna make me cry with how sweet of a dude you are. Keep on keepin' on, and keep bein' as rad as you've always been, Alpha! Thank you for being one of the best youtubers I could have ever subscribed to! Maybe this comment's too sappy, but who cares? I sure don't. Thank you for being rad, Alpha. I mean that with every single bit of my heart. - a random user on the internet, aka me
11:14 theres are 4 frames of jacob and pchal making out
Jacob Alpharad Spending Money: The Movie
Zoro in the thumbnail 😭
I’m so glad that sanji is making YouTube video
If the Marshal AC plush is targeted that has to be the funniest way to call someone a twink I’ve ever seen
The most wholesome of videos! ❤❤❤
One of my favourite videos by far
Your feelings that you realized while being in Japan and how it made you think and how you focused on enjoying it reminds me of my time in Paris last year. I've studied French throughout high school and college where I actually had it as one of my majors, and the pandemic massively delayed my opportunity to study abroad to actually use my French. That month-long trip was the best time of my life - I felt like what I was doing had purpose, I enjoyed the lack of ability for me to sit and spend a ton of time at the computer or on my phone, and I was in the moment, learning how to use the Paris metro, learning my way walking around the city, and using my French. Everything has been so much worse since I had to come home because I hate this place and hated my job (that I got fired from like a month ago) and after all the thinking and being miserable, I've decided to go get my master's in French because I do not belong here. Needless to say your heartfelt revelation reminded me of mine and brought up some strong feelings haha
Thank you for telling us about your trip Sanji!
bro the video is really good and the end is so fcking cute, but i calculate how much he spend and its several times the value of my all university career.... now i'm miserable
damn, after watching this video I wish I was alpharads friend, hit me up if you see this.
19:00 That is so good to hear , it makes me happy to know that you've been able to reach your own happiness and that you know how to keep it. Keep being awesome Alpharad, We love and appreciate you very much ❤️
HELP THE TRIP TOTAL
I'm so damn jealous
Alpharad so based for being happy ❤️
If this wasn't the most wholesome Alpharad video.
7:02  AWESOME GUY
Damm that endning was *GLORIOUS*  Cheers
This video reminded me of the trip to Japan I took a couple months ago and it has got to be one of my favorite memories because of what I got to see and get and also because I was with really nice people during it, Magical is the perfect word to describe my trip there
This is the most based kind of person
Bro reference the homeless man who ate his chicken. no other creator could match this world building
Post the karaoke video, coward.
11:14😱😱
Wholesome meter filled, glad you’re happy Mr. Rad
Pokémon!
My biggest takeaway from your trip is that Pokemon Company is okay with emulation and it’s just Nintendo that’s the annoying one. Also glad you enjoyed the trip!
It makes me so happy to see Pokémon support the YouTube community after years of being completely against them
F you Alpharad your supposed to make me laugh not cry
Having a kid go up to you and say "sanji-san!" In japan must be the best feeling ever
1:30 Can you please tell me why the Netherlands is in C
Alpha. We need cosplay now. You are now Sanji.
ive been watching you since early 2018 and i love the new alpharad, you actually look happy
really cute video but seeing how much money you spent gave me some really weird anxiety lmao
we love a happy little identity crisis. cheers, internet funny man!
I miss Japan so much. This video made me so happy 😭
I'm so glad you enjoyed Yokohama!!!! I love my city, and we were happy to have you. Did I stay in the city for the tournament? Fuck no, too many people. Am I glad you enjoyed it? YES!! And I'm so glad you included all the sweet videos of your friends opening gifts. That's exactly what I want to be able to do someday!!
Not that last section had my face hurting from smiling
Is no one gonnatslk Abt how he kissed another man?
11:14 just seeing You kiss that guy with a beard. was a surprise but a welcome one
I'm so glad to hear that you are happy and that you had a great time in Japan! I finished my final semester in college there this summer and had many similar experiences- spending too much money, becoming obsessed with a certain crane game prize, buying so many souvenirs for friends. It truly is a magical place
I might go to Japan this summer I saw that jar man statue I’m going to Japan
Pretty sure Japanese Doctor Peper would at least use actual Sugar instead of corn like we do here at least... but given the spicy flavor is what sticks out I could see how it's less of a difference for Dr.Pepper then like Coke or something.
But did you get somethings for your self if so WhatsApp did you get
Oh my an upload from Mr Rad, that makes me want to please buy your merch frfr
you have no idea how suspicous the guards probably were when they xrayed your empty bag
On 4:06 it looks like that character has no head
I'm honestly just so glad to hear you've just been feeling so much better, and after watching you and your shenanigans for so long, you're finally taking the time to ENJOY the fruits of your labor, and that your really enjoying your time.
What did he get for Crow......
I hope you're mentally healthier now.  Taking breaks is part of the grind.
Its actually adorable that a child mistook you for Sanji. He is My favorite Straw Hat
He said he’s happy LETS FUCKING GOOOO!!!
Ok, I had the BIGGEST. FREAKING. GRIN. at the end!!!😁
This video was way more emotional then what I expected, so happy to see how happy you are
Now i really wonder what Pointcrow got that he couldn't show...
It makes me feel happy that the content creators I follow are happy and healthy. Especially since they have jobs that are incredibly taxing.
Man what a wonderful video to watch. And even though we have all been watching from a tv, phone or monitor I feel like we have all been right there as a part of the journey :)
Viral sensation or not, this video made me smile wider than any others I’ve seen. Friends are so important and letting them know just how much you love and appreciate them is really cool. Great video. Also, your unique Magnemite looked like the happiest little guy! Super loved him!
❤❤❤❤
Bro kissed Pokémon challenges for .1 seconds
Someone imagined alpharad happy
We're glad your happy too ❤
Its not just Japanese 7-11, a lot of the Asian 7-11s are way better than the North American ones. On a trip to Hong Kong I got a sim card (prepaid for like 5 dollars Canadian), made my own burrito, got sushi, bought a book in English and somehow didn't get food poisoning. It was a magical experience.
11:14 This is in a video sponsored by the pokemon company, i love it
Alpharad being the realest mf i heard for 27:32 minutes is Definitely one of my favorite videos.
You gotta take more vacations, like even another one soon if you are able to
Hey, no worries about foreign chain restaurants.  When I went to Europe, I specifically wanted to go to a McDonald's in Paris.  I did, and it was better than ours.
11:16 🧐
KONICHIWHATS UP GAAAMEERSS
Dude, I legitimately fucking BAWLED. You took care of yourself, thought of and cared for your friends, and still laughed the whole way through. You are truly a light in this world. Thank you for being you  ❤😭
did alpharad funnyman himself really just say he had social anxiety? i am shocked
2:45 Legends says little Timmy is still trying to pause at the perfect time and look hard enough to see what lay beyond the blur to this day.
Im currently in Japan for the first time and am spending way too much money  Highly relatable
Thank you Mr. Alpharad, love your content and seeing you genuinely happy is so inspiring.
oh my god that was such a sweet ending!!! I'm glad you titled it "spent too much money" and not "wasted money"  because that was anything but a waste. You know your friends SO well, you most certainly weren't lying when you said that they all mean the world to you
pokemon company knew you so well that by paying your trip was not worth it but an investment
Alpha… what did you do at the end of day 4? Do I even want to know?
There really isn't any feeling like giving back to those who you care about and have helped you through the years, it's just such a nice feeling and its awesome to see those people happy too; easily one of my favorite videos on this entire website for sure, thank you for all the memories for so long and I'm glad to see you finally feeling better.  Genuinely can't believe it has been 5+ years since I started watching this channel, and it will likely always remain one of my favorites.
Did you really think we wouldn't see those 3 frames of you smooching Jan..?
What happened at 11:14 😅
Can I have a gift box pls
That last segment displays who AlphaRad actually is; a man who values and cherishes his friendships above all things,  and is constantly thinking of his homies.  What a lad.
Pay a man to come and buy your merch. Smart move Nintendo, smart move.
Damn what a good video! That make me want to visit Japan more I’ve been waiting for 6 years but the day I arrive I will buy Zelda and rumiko takahashi merch while exploring everywhere!
So that’s what game freak is doing with all their money.  Instead of putting it into the actual games,they’re giving it to Alpharad to feed into his intrusive thoughts.  I like it
20:50 when you find out you have that friend who knows you better than yourself. Protect at all cost.
I saw that kiss
11:13 enemies to lovers
I would do this  Except i am a nobody
i cqn't say anything about this 11:09
Didn’t expect to cry from this video and yet here we are! So wholesome and inspiring, it’s clear you know your friends to a T, my favorite part was when everyone was gushing over the plushes of their favorite Pokémon ❤
Happy to hear, that y enjoyed Japan so much 👍🥲
Live your content irl Sanji-san.
So Moral of the story, buy tons of merch and you'll finally be happy
He got sponsored by pokemon s/v thats wild
Bro used a kingdom hearts music for the neat end, shits gonna make me cry maaaan..but to be real here, hope you had a good time Alpha been enjoying your content for the last 6 years and im almost 18 now. Your videos always make me smile when I come accross them on the day of upload or even rewatching them when they re-appear in my recommended, so once again, thank you for making content for all these years and im glad you enjoyed your trip ❤
It made me so happy from start to end, keep being you and being happy!
it's okay jacob, now that you own all this pokemon merchandise you will be happy
It is now cannon that Pchall and Alpha are friends
It’s so heartwarming that you made those gifts for your friends it really made me happy for you and them!
1:31 Glad to see Australia there, as an aussi, hehe
The Pokémon company spending more money on jacob than the main series games 💀
An addiction I cannot save you from. I am sorry. Glad you had a good time!
ALPHA STOP MAKING WANT TO GO TO JAPAN MORE STOP IT STOOOOOOOP
8:40 is that foreshadowing!? :0
Got me all teary-eyed at the end. Glad you had a wonderful time!!!
Did you sent bunch of porn to point crow?
This is my Favourite Video yet 👍
It’s always nice for people to appreciate the people that mean the most to them, you’re a good man Jacob
i was nervous that jacob was giving his retirement speech for a bit 💀
I know most are here for the ludicrous spending and cool stuff in Japan. But I really just want to point out how human Jacob is. He loves creating this stuff for us. But he is still human. It's inspiring for anyone, musicians, artists, youtubers, even people following ventures of their own discovering the world. Seeing him being so straightforward about his mentality not only is healthy for himself, but for all of us as well. Showing the importance of self care and knowing motivation and objectives are just part of what you do, not solely what you do. Thank you Alpharad for so many years of great content, seeing you grow has helped us do the same. And I can't wait to see your joyful adventures in the future!
This video makes me want to get a job...
Congratz on all the hard work ya put into ya career mate. Youve earn it :) and thx for all ya given to the people of the world
YOOOOO As an Aussie, our Macca’s being S in your tier list is based
7:51 Jaiden has tattoos?
6:18 that means it was a good one alpha
To be honest who wouldn’t. Hope I can go to Japan one day. Lovely to hear your super happy in life.
I hate it when I go to Japan and go into 3 billion dollars debt because I poured all my money into anime souvenirs and vending machines
Hatsune Miku is the sole reason I know or care about anything Pokémon right now
It's official....the Japanese have all the cool stuff!
I really love you and your friends’ content, and I’m really glad you have such a good relationship with them. I just want you to know that your fans are just some goofballs who know you want to do your best. And you do.
Dude that kid met an absolute legend when he saw Sanji-San
Seeing Alpha spend as much as he did for the Dratini makes me wonder what would happened if CDawgVa did a crane game video with him
<3
wheres the gifts for major?
R u still makeing more ace of hearts
Jaiden obsessed with Cururucho, call her Jaiden Hyperfixations
i had always shipped Alpha and PC 🥰, nice to see i still had the touch
When the cry for help came so soon.... yeah we all knew where this was going lol
Alpha spending all that money not for himself but also on his friends is so nice
"Japan: The wallet destroyer"
Wtf how can I be salty about life when this vid is so wholesome
god, what a great cautionary tale for anyone thinking about going to japan                     & also for anyone starting out or wanting to do youtube
Hearing alpharad being recognized as sanji wasnt what I was expecting today 😂
Cucurucho at 9:40, thank me later
Glad to see you out here living your wildest dream after pawns like ourselves press a button a few million times. And as always…thank you for your time Mr. Internet funny man. You deserve a break as well.
Love the video especially the mystery box opening!!😺
didnt know you were gay?
Why is the announcement of the next championship being in Hawaii ill-timed?
10:16 I went to a jump store near the Tokyo dome and there was blind bag pins for dragon ball characters and spent like 30 bucks to not get the character I what
Bro imma need that leafeon plush
I will lose my life savings if 10 miles from that pop up store
He scammed himself by paying Pokémon for everything and more
when i went to japan i spent like 600 dollars and i thought that was insane but this video has made me feel better about my financial decisions
God I love alpharad
swedish mcdonalds S-tier lets fucking gooooooooooo
8:28
Aw the end is wholesome 🥰
This is unironically one of my favorite videos from Alpharad. One of my first friends in high school recommended the channel to me and I haven't looked back since, and I just really like the second half of the video a lot. I'm just cheesing while writing this comment, I loved it!
Glad to see Jan and Jacob getting along so well at 11:14
watching the story unfold on his Instagram story was... interesting, to say the least
Does anyone have an estimate on how much he spent? Asking for a friend of course
the ending was incredibly sweet and thoughtful, absolutely amazing video <3! also extremely jealous lol
Bro turned into a philosopher by the end of this. F you for making me feel things alpha...
damn here i am crying at a sponsored video of a funny man going to japan and buying merch. Bravo!
I honestly cried after the whole unpacking of gifts your friends made. Ever since i went on my first trip by myself i made sure to get family and friends something special and unique that i know will be of their liking and seeing you do the same for this amazing trip is honestly god tier wholesome I hope you had an amazing time in japan and that your friends enjoyed every gift Jacob. You truly are a friend
I just want to write a simple comment, I've followed Jacob from the day I was 17. Now, I'm 22, living on my own and trying to live from paycheck to paycheck. I hit 22 a few days ago, and my friends gave me for my birthday exclusive figure of Orange Piccolo. I was so happy I cried, to have friends so wonderful. Right now, I realized that Jacob was a really good role model for me in my early adult life. Watching his videos made me happy when I was sad, and watching him progress while I was progressing in life, thanks to small moral messages in his videos, made me a better person. I just want to thank you Jacob Alpharad, you are truly, truly, amazing ❤❤❤❤
I once went to Singapore to meet up with some long-lost family members who had to move from the U.S to Singapore for their permanent jobs. MY GOD was it beautiful!!! The gardens, the rooftop resort, and the shows man, the SHOWS!!! But it was nice to see some of my long-lost  family members again, that thankfully can still speak perfect English, XD!!!
15:30 is that grand line review!?
Surely he didn’t make this video just so he could write these off on taxes…
That ending was the serotonin I needed for the next five years
Never has a YouTube funny man brought such emotions into my heart
It still makes me endlessly happy that Jacob got addicted to One Piece. I got really into it around 6 years ago, and seeing it really boom in popularity only a short time later has been nice to see. Magic circle.
Been watching for a while and I don't know how to say how good this feels. Glad you had a great time and thank you for sharing.
PHYSICALLY can't wait for the merch store to reopen, I NEED to buy the Frozen In Time CD now that I have money😭
The person who makes the clay pokemon for the cards is a person I didn't know existed, but now is my hero.
Awesome :)
11:14 hmmmmm
sanji is such a good youtuber 😂
I myself have been spending this whole year taking care of myself. So its nice to see you mr alpharad are very happy and in a good space. Keep on rocking man. ❤
I see Jacob is living up to his AFA award 11:14
That bit where the kids said you where sanji was so funny
11:13 alpharad…don’t think we don’t see that kiss. 🤣🤣🤣
Kids in car made me PISSSDDDSDS
You shouldve gone to joyoploys
Sanji-san became Santa for his friends! About your feelings in the past years... That's.... relatable, but it's great that you're doing better! What's important is that you're happy with what you're doing, you need to take more vacations if you're stressed-
Pokemon made the best choice bringing Alpharad to Japan. I'm so glad he got time to have fun,make content and be a Saint Nicholas of japan to his friendos. 😎👍✨️
10:36 jisan also means old man so he could have just been calling you old lmao
Take breaks we wont be mad
Absolute banger. I like how varied it is
Everything you have is well deserved we all love you alpharad
I got emotional seeing all the reactions of your friend group, I already knew this, but the end part of this video just further made me realize how great of a person you are Thanks for making great content 😁
Me and my friends are conspiring to breach Japan during our graduation, this shall serve as valuable research.  No Splatoon merch shall escape my clutches AHAHAHAHAHAHA
Mmuaa väsyttää
8:22 yea..the place where you spend money.. definitely..
11:14 HUH?!?!!
You met Yuka Morii!
11:14 ...
There are so many of your videos that feel like a before and after, like the end of an era, but this one specially does.
11:14 It pops up for only a second but why dis you add a clip of you making out with someone 😂
The taxes you had to pay on all of that only to give it all away to your friends. You're such an thoughtful and kind friend.
lmao the tiny clip of you drunk making out w someone
You better pay your accountant well
I was not prepared to see alpharad making out with Pokemonchallenges
Even tho I just started watching him a few weeks ago, I love him so mutch and love all of his videos
you're so cool, jacob alpharad!!!!!!
Alpha now broke
real
If any Pokemon product is out of stock blame him.😂
The later half of the video was so heartfelt, hearing Jacob talk about his feelings towards the Alpharad channel and his life is the most honest Jacob has been with his fans. the ending with all of his friends was also incredibly endearing
He said Shibuya and my brain is cursed by a certain incident bt Gege Akutami
I may not be a big One piece fan but that baby in car stickers goes hard
This the first time I see a yt get sponsored for the main game itself and not the spinoffs
I've been watching since... I wanna say 2016? It's been surreal watching Jacob's channel develop. Even without his little rant about how he's happy, you can *see* just from his videos that he's getting happier and happier as time goes on, and he realizes himself.  I honestly got teary-eyed during that final segment, with the rant about him being happy, and all his friends opening the gifts he got them It makes me so happy to see that he's gotten to this point in his life! Subscribe to Alpharad, and congratulations Jacob for finding a way to be truly happy!
Enjoy! ❤💜
YouTuber: YouTuber Alpharad:
The end of this episode is one of the best payoffs I've seen in YouTube content. How wonderful that you have such a great group of friends and that you were able to share a bit of Japan's magic with them.
Spend 10k, no balls.
I have bean waiting for a Japan video for sooooooooo long.
i actually cant unsee it now... alpha actually looks like sanji without the curly eyebrows
Really glad to hear, not only the trip, that everything is going well! That you are most of all happy and the thanks and small montage towards your friends was heartwarming. With capping off with all of the joy you were able to bring to them.   Your journey ans growth has been amazing, Jacob. Keep on being awesome.   P.s next ace of spades album when?
That one frame of alpha being wasted and going at it on another man is the most hilarious and wild thing I have seen him do lmao 11:14
Went in expecting shit post, came out with a more positive outlook on life. Jacob Alpharad wtf
Wholesome
You're great Jacob and please keep doing whatever you love. Your enthusiasm and passion is highly infectious and we feel all of it <3
amazing and heartwarming video man, do what you feel is best for you and even though there's a disconnect between you and 3 million people watching you on a screen, know that all 3 million of us support you man!! do what's best for you!
Can we just acknowledge that he got another 1,000 subscribers since recording this? Thanks (17:05)
Glad you are doing better Alpha! I'm so happy that you had a great time in Japan and got to spend all your hard-earned money haha No but seriously I had a constant smile on my face especially in the last part. Making your friends happy and giving them thoughtful gifts is such an amazing feeling. Keep up the great work ❤
Bro I got SCARED when I heard shibuya cause all I could think of was JJK shinuya incident
I feel good 2 hear that ur happy Alpha. I wish everything good 2 u
Hey your wallet may be empty but at least you didn’t end up in the hospital after this one
Also really enjoy the ending your truly a chad tbh
Day 10 of asking about the Ace Life Size Statue Purchase, and the Miku Car Showcase. And what a wholesome Japan Visit 💯
I couldn’t imagine a world were you walk into a 7-11 to buy P💀
Austrian mcdonalds is also really good.
I’ve been an alpharad enjoyer since the how to play 101 days, and this video made me actually parasocially tear up, as a random internet person you don’t know, I’m so happy for you
The end was so wholesome, im crying now...
Alpha pls your going to make Me cry.  I am genuinely glad you find yourself in such a amazing place.
One of my favorite videos ever on this channel, and I have been watching for sooo many years. The last segment was especially heartwarming❤️  glad you had such an amazing trip!
Jacob: *Lands in japan*  Hatsune Miku: 🧍‍♀️
Bro i see what u did there 2:03 they were soo wrong for that
Alright folks, put your guesses in, how much do you think he spent in merch, I’m personally guessing over 1000
I've been watching your channel for several years, laughed a ton throughout that time, but legit hearing you just say that you're happy, like legit happy, was the best.
Honestly this video was very interesting considering the look back on your history. I remember discovering finding you back through the How to Mr Game and Watch 101 video. I will admit I haven’t been keeping up with your channel but I have to say it’s inspiring to see you still going doing videos. The ending was really sweet and makes me happy you’ve been able to do so many cool things. Here’s to the amazing things you’ll do in the future.
I wish you the best man. I am sorry about the mental struggles that you had to face. We all need to enjoy our lives more
How big was Pokemon Challenges peepee
Clicked for the Worlds experience, stayed (and cried) for the wholesomeness at the end. Thanks Jacob Alpharad.
It's about the time of the magnemite building I realised, yeah this really is just a school field trip isn't it. But like, the kind I really wish I could've gone on
This video is wholesome af  So happy you’ve found yourself Alpharad
Happy for you Jacob
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE ENEMIES TO LOVERS THAT IS ALPHARAD AND JAN KISSING 11:14
This video was entertaining, but that bit at the end was just so heartwarming. You can just feel the happiness coming from everyone. 🥰
The end of this video is just the cutest shit. Jacob really loves his friends and it shows. He absolutely nailed the personalized gifts.
It is so satisfying to watch this video after following you for so long. Ever since I saw your smash content I fell in love with your sense of humour and you personality so much that you basically became my favorite content creator of them all. I'm very happy and proud of you for all the things you've been through and it's so heartwarming to know that you're in a far better place now. You're the best of them all, thank you for always making my day better.
I love nothing more than seeing people do cool and awesome and hella sick as fuck things for their friends it's so wholesome
1:31 when did he go to Mexico? Anyways, i'm glad we are on A tier
I see Jaiden, I click.
26:57 facts
The montage at the end is one of the sweetest things I've seen on YouTube. So heartfelt, so thoughtful, so giving. Glad that you're in a better mental space than you were a few years ago, as someone who's been subbed since 2014(I think) it's been an incredible journey. Keep taking care of yourself!
There was only one moment in this video where I DIDN'T have a smile on my face, and that was the moment where you weren't meant to have a smile. We're so proud of you, Jacob. Rock on <3
during the part about his career, i saw a clip from Ace Of Hearts. And I wanna say I love ace of hearts' music. All of Alpha's content is some of my favourite. Keep up the work king.
I didn't even make the Sanji comparison until now, but dammit it's more apt than I could've really imagined lmao
11:14 I think we can all agree that this was bound to happen eventually, right?
Bro is a millionaire and barely spent any money.
11:14 >:)
seeing alpharad’s friends open the stuff he sent to them is so wholesome. i love it so much
Thats so fucking raw emotions, i love it
Japan is making a habit outta retiring creators and it’s scaring me.  I’m happy for you Jacob! Have a good night!
Bro him using the Mario kart Wii credits theme gave me mad nostalgia I was not expecting to have today.
Your videos are so entertaining
Learning work life balance in japan😂
My favorite part is 1000% the gifting at the end. Alpha is the next Mr.beast.
No way this video made me cry man.......
Did Jacob just say he likes Ogrepon?  Oh no...
As someone who has been to a Japanese 7 11 it is the bomb
this is one of the best videos ive seen from him
I went to japan this year and i really want to go back merch here in canada is so boring and expensive.
Dear GOD this just makes me wanna visit Japan so badly...
Glad to you had an amazing and safe trip! I don't know if I would be able to do that. I don't speak Japanese and be afraid of getting lost. Plus it seems very overwhelming. I would go to Canada instead purely for the food. Plus it seems calm and peaceful.
21:25 he definitely got pron or something lmao
5:38 HOLY FUCKING BINGLE
That ending almost had me in tears (especially as someone who loves anything Japan). So thank Jacob, for everything!
Thoughts and prayers for when you do taxes next year
Bro straight up reached self-actualization halfway through the video
The end of this video is so wholesome it almost made me cry c: I am glad you are happy and get to share it with others Mr. Alpharad
See this is why I cant ever go to Japan I will go broke so fast too soon 😂
Alpharad, i know that you have probably heard this a bunch of times but you are the g.o.a.t when it comes to storytelling. I wish my vocabulary was legendary as your videos because i want to use words that would compliment the level of quality you put in your videos. You are NUMBER ONE in my eyes. I cannot think of any other youtuber or creator who puts such a performance in every video, on this platform. You honestly deserve more but more importantly we are glad that you are in a happy mindset. Stay healthy my guy and continue being our G.O.A.T.
59000th comment
11:14 kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Wat a video the end was verry hart warming Alphachad🥲
So, what you're saying is.... Jancob is real???
11:14 yup...
11:14 HOLY SHIT IT HAPPENED
11:14 AYO??????????????????🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
This makes me so smile in so many ways.
I'm not crying my face is just sweating😢  Alpharad/Jacob is a wonderful individual this such a sweet video😭💙💙💙
Wasn’t gonna get the Pokemon dlc but I’ll get it for you Jacob Alpharad
Pokemon really wanted the "nuzlocke king" to play in the pokemon world championship
That’s the most profitable media franchise in the world for ya
JACOB GAY???
Damn, I wish I could be alparad’s friend…oh well at least I have this parasocial relationship
Jacob really cheated on Scooch?!?!?!
Heartwarming end
NINTENDO!!!! LET AMERICA BUY THAT MERCH TOO!! WE WILL!!! AND WE WILL LOVE IT!!!
11:14 had me laughing more than it should lmaoooo
... not gonna lie bro, you DO kinda look like Sanji 🤣
This video became so real and the ending was so wholesome. I'm happy you're happy now and you sure made your friends happy too!
15:13 and you took a college class in show business
Zoro is still lost lol
It’s great to hear that you’re doing great and feel like you’re on a good place Alpharad! Keep up the amazing content and hope you stay happy!
This was so nice and touching. You really held it down for the squad fam.
Video actually made me cry. So glad you had a good time :)
If I had a million dollars, I would have spent even more than Alpharad did. Probably all of it.
Under one hour gang! 🎉✨
Seeing everyone's reactions to the gifts at the end made me cry. Because even though I've watched some like Failboat and Ross, seeing the other content creators who I haven't watched as much made me realize how special they are to Jacob. Edit: I'm rewatching this and now I wish that "Swear To My Bones" was in the outro for one final time. Because not only did that song use to play in Alpharad's outro, but the symbolism in Persona 5 had it play when there was such a strong bond between the cast of characters.
Watching Jacob's friends being filled with joy because of the stuff he got them is just so wholesome to see.
Hunter hunter
Oh my god bro went to seven eleven wtf whyyy family mart is so much better try some famichiki its the best convenience store food ever
Mexico in A tier Nice
You’re cool as fuck. Every time I watch your videos, I’m having fun. My favorite videos from your channel are the ones where you’re having fun, because It means I’m having fun, you know? You’re just, fucking sick man.
Thank you Alpharad
So like... Jaden's been walking about with her Yakuza-like bare arms... In Japan? I'm surprised this didn't cause a scene.
I didn't expect that emotional whiplash after seeing silly Japan footage but I'm genuinely so happy for you, man And thank you SO much for the gifts, you are truly one of the most generous people I know
Damn this was a great persona soundtrack with pictures of Japan and a man talking in the background
11:14 LMAOOOOO thats adorable
As someone who grew up watching you this gave me tears
random cucurucho cameo
Oh to be alpha’s friend
This is one of the few videos I didn’t skip the Ad because it’s just insane that you’re sponsored by the Pokémon company
bro was in persona 5 irl
That was wholsome😊
Can’t believe Alpharad got to visit Persona 5
I would never trust a big mac with an egg on it in the states. That'd be speed running food poisoning.
I thought this was going to be a fun vlog about enjoying Japan and buying a shit ton of merch, so your takeaway from the trip and reflection of your YouTube career was really heartwarming and vulnerable. This is one of my new favorite Alpharad videos. Thanks for all that you do
Holy crap… this was one of the greatest and most emotional Youtube videos I have ever seen.  Absolutely amazing! And thank you to the Pokemon Company for allowing this to happen.  This video has only fuelled my desire as a weeb to visit Japan one day!
Nah the child called alpha sanji im dead.💀💀💀
Jacob really went to Japan to Mr.beast his friends.
We need jaiden to make a video of her trip to Japan… she’s never done that before…
If Jacob spent over 17k, good lord how much did Jaiden spend on the trip?
I just find it funny how he mentions how much money he's obtained off of his channel before talking about his community
This video made me realise how gkad I am I found this chanel.
Damn bruh, what a beautiful video. As someone chasing happiness, you definitely put a smile on my face the whole way. Literally stole all of my attention, I legit forget where I was. Thanks, Internet Funny Man.
Bro made scarlet and violet sound like a mobile game
No I'm not crying because of the beauty of friendship and the unending power of love, why do you ask?
This is one of the most wholesome and emotional videos ive ever seen.    Three cheers for Jacob, the best youtuber on the platform!
Not gonna lie that ending made me tear up a bit
The Alpharad transformation from 2015-2023 is crazy
Imagine you're just a kid from Japan wanting to go buy something from the shonen jump shop and then you see *SANJI FROM ONE PIECE?*
Dang, this was one of the best vlog videos ive ever seen. And the ending of it where you gifted your friend's with all different types of items you got on your trip was so wholesome. Alpha is truly one of if not the greatest not just content creator or friend, but person in the world. Always so kind and caring no matter what (RIP his wallet/bank account though) And keep up the awesome work my guy.
11:14 *_PAUSE_* Mr pharad, I implore you to cut back on your drinking habbits.
Congrats alpha, you deserved that vacation.
This video was an absolute rollercoaster and some peak content, maybe the best you ever made. You could just feel all the love and passion that went into this. Funny, wholesome and inspiring with how far you have grown as a person. I'm glad I have been here for the ride. Also One Piece.
Not me genuinely tearing up about Alpharad opening up about his change in life and how he's happier now at 9 in the morning?? Keep it up, Alpha, this video was amazing and I wish you all the happiness in the world (●'◡'●)
That all looked so much fun and I'm glad this all helped to make you happy, as you should always try to make yourself happy. Work is important, but your own health is even more so. And seeing all your friends'' reactions to the stuff you got for them had the biggest smile on my face. Does it all now get written off as a business expense? XD
No one can convince me Jacob and Jan didn't fuck on this trip.
I just find it amazing how Jacob spent 17k in Japan, and yet ended up giving most of it to his friends as gifts  Absolute madlad 💜
Thank you so much for your content 😊 and I hope you have a great week you helped me through my depression I’m serious you helped through my depression thank you so much ☺️
So the next question is: What's next?
This is the sweetest thing ive ever seen!! :)
1:30 alpharad, i love you for not putting Mexican mcdonalds on a low tier, you get my instant like
No one see him kiss someone?
HOW MUCH FUCKING MONEY DID HE SPEND?????!! HAHAHAAHAHAHHAHA (good video)
as someone who was anxious to buy one shirt for their halloween costume today, i fear you
I really can't even comprehend having that many close friends or even a friend group of this size but man you treasure them and the memories you'll create together bc you won the friends jackpot and I wish to have anything close someday❤💪🏼🤯
So glad to see you guys had fun and I was even happier to see Conor make a slight debut 😭😭
well, now i have an idea of what kind of success i want to achieve in life!
Does anyone know or have a list of all of Jacob’s friends / creators at the end of the video?
this video was amazing, it was very fun to watch and the ending reveal was so wholesome
oh my god this video was so fucking cute,
you are a great man
Alpharad is sanji confirmed. I knew it!!!!
Nice
As a big fan of Mr Fruit who has had multiple mental health updates through the years, this was refreshing to see alpharad come to the realization that numbers aren’t everything. We’ll always watch your videos. We love your content. But take care of yourself first, always.
Aw man that went from envy inducing, to being relatable, to inspiring, to heartwarming. I am currently finishing uni and looking for a job and I have dreamed for a long time about finally being able to give something back to my friends and family. I can only hope I get this opportunity one day.
Wow. Dude, this video was amazing! This may be one of your best videos yet. I'm SO glad you had a wonderful time in Japan. You've always been one of my favorite content creators, and seeing how many years have passed, you're still one of the best! Also, seeing you give mystery boxes to all of your friends, really made me feel very happy. Jacob, from one of your biggest fans, keep doing what you do, and I can't wait to see what you do next. 💙
8  s u i t c a s e s
AYO NO ONE GONNA MENTION THAT JANXJACOB MAKE OUT CLIP????  Edit: Goddamn, what a wholesome second half of the video. We're happy that you're happy and in a better mind space. Imo, CC worry too much about the YT shitty algorithm, but loyal viewers are willing to wait months for content if the CC needs a break for their own sanity. YT burnout is real. Lots of great CC have left YT because they prioritized making videos over their own health. I imagine YT could be much different+better if so many didn't quit.
Australia on top of the maccas tireless huh as an Aussie I didn’t think I it was that great but idk haven’t been out of aus so can’t really compare others countries that well.
Common Jacob W
This reminds me of my first time in Japan. Japan 7-11 god tier
This was wholesome as fuck. Love this!
Wow, this was a very wholesome video :)
alpharad spent the money Pokemon gave him on Pokemon merch thus causing pokemon to make back the money they spent and then some
Tax right offs are compulsive spenders band-aids
peak fucking alpharad content thank GOD
The ending was so sweet 🥺💕 I look forward to you having more fun in life and seeing how that reflects in your future videos!!!
This feels like not only a peak Alpharad video, but a peak Jacob video, and that is absolutely awesome Good on you man
Nice Rad!
You and Jaiden probably looked hard as fuck to the average Japanese person with all your tattoos out
I wonder what alphard would do without the persona 5 ost
I'm so glad to see you happy, Alpha. It gives me hope that I can find my own happiness in some way. That my hard work will eventually pay off. Also, yeah, I would probably do the same thing you did for your friends. God bless you, Alpha.
Sanji has a youtube channel?!?!?!
dude i need to get rich
JACOB GOT TO DO MY DREAM AND JUST SPOIL MY FRIENDS WITH EVERYTHING THEY WANT AND GIVE THEM ALL THEIR NICHE INTERESTS THEY DIDNT KNOW I REMEMBERED
I feel like spending too much money in Japan is just normal
Jacob that was insane. You're so amazing and this is beautiful (yes, I cried wdym?)
This was the most emotional roller coaster video that Alpharad has ever made honestly
I love that Jacob makes sure his friends know how important they are to him
11:14 JACOB WE CAN'T JUST GLAZE PAST THIS MR "jan jokes about being into me, maybe a little TOO much" lmaoooo
Stop making me feel emotions im supposed to be a husk
From the title to the end, superb
was NOT expecting to see alpha be homies with Ohara
happy for you big guy ❤❤❤
*I was sponsored by pokemon but was forced to make a video I didn't care about
This is sick hope you keep going
I hope one day I can follow in your footsteps. Not personally but as a content creator and following my dream of going to Japan, giving back to those I cherish, appreciate and love. I've followed your channel off and on since middle school and you never disappoint. I'm happy you got to see what's important to you in your life as well and share that with us. We're so proud of you man. Thank you for all that you do.
Ha, yes, my favorite youtuber Sanji, being confused by Alpharad from One Piece 🤣🤣🤣
I want to be like you when I grow up
Hi Jo
Damn it already time for the Sanjirad arc?
11:14 where the rivalry ends
Hey there, I don't know if you still talk to Travis, if not and you guys are on good terms I'm sure a call would be good. I miss the drunk commentary you two had back in the smash 4 days.
As someone who's birthday IS 7/11, glad to hear there's such a magical place connected to that number combo :D
🎉🎉
OMG seeing Jacob know his friends so well is so awesome <33333
Don't believe him about Pokemon DLC , it does not add much. And what it does add hammers your FPS like crazy because they didn't optimize. Plus the story just plain sucks , just as much as before. Don't buy it , IT'S A TRAP!!
Alpha spended so much money, he made a video to make it a little bit better
this was unexpectedly wholesome
i will lose all my Money on my vist to Japan
rip ur bank account i guess
I was there for 6 weeks and I think we spent the same amount of money 😂
Now we go to his financial recovery in Step 2: Tax Evasion
keep up the good work
That ending was so cute
How has this man not done a CdawgVA crane game collab video yet?
Jacob, you need to bring a "Trip  Mom". Someone who will turn this car around and tell you no when you try spending $100,000 on anything other than a down payment for a house
this is just like when that little boy visited japan on august 6th 1945
this is actually so wholesome i love it
i wanted to see more failboat happy...
What a chad
"From Grocerys, to Porn" Alright it does have everything
Yoo it’s that place from hit atlus game persona 5
21:53 what was it
I love your shirt, where can I get it? 👀
Oh god I am watching the ads in this he need the ad revenue lol
11:14 erm
started watching because of a mudkip challenge, and stayed here because of the amazing content and the wholesome guy who made it...
17:43 But don’t worry because Ace of Hearts is fire and is definitely worth your time   Also bring back the merch specially the short sleeve hoodie please and thank you
5:41 the infamous cucurucho...... oh god
I just want to say I give you all of my respect Alpha. You are a amazing creator and I love your work and all you do for your friends
Wait he actually bought the ace statue? thats awesome
ALPHARAD UPLOADED LET'S GO
Early gang
As a person who recently went to Japan over the summer, I can vouch that Japan isn't actually real and it's just one really fucking big merchandise store except theres also 33 more. Oh and also all of your money is being vacuumed straight out of your pockets.
glad my home country got put in the s tier for MacDonald's list! (GO AUSTRALIA)
This video to me is just, "True Pokemon Master"
This video was so wholesome TvT having so much fun and still keeping your friends at home in mind, this has to be my favorite video of yours :D
Oh my god. I love this. I waited long because I was curious about your trips and more what you bought, but I'm so happy to hear that you are feeling good. I still struggle from my Depression which pushed me one year till now and it doesn't seem to end soon but people like you, people who made it throgh something like this let me feel hope. Thanks Alphared, Thanks Jacob and thanks to the people who gave you the power and strength to be with us and don't give up. Keep it up man. Love ya <3
That "BABY in car" merchandise with Chopper on it that Jacob gave to Dash goes so fucking hard.
what in the hell did he get pointcrow?
I love how they invited pchal but the pokemon company doesn't like nuzlockes nor modding so idk what happened
Lmao I love that I just assumed he went with Jaiden and I wasn't wrong
11:14 the enemies to lovers arc is finally complete <3
Norway McDonalds being in C (bottom) tier is expected and surprising at the same time
Alpharad is a special kind of youtuber that ive watched my whole life. I struggle a lot with anxiety and fear of the future and growing up and seeing this video as well as the super Nintendo world posts really hepled with that, seeing him with all his friends having a great time made me excited for the future which is something i dont say much anymore. This video is something to treasure on this channel and seeing all your friends so happy with your presents and how happy you were yourslef on the trip makes all us, the viewers happy. I don't really know how to explain it but i just love this video and hearing how happy you are. Jacob, keep doing what your doin man we all love u 💙 Edit: 18:50 YOU CANT DO THIS TO ME YOUR TOO WHOLESOME
I gotta ask. Was that a real kiss between you and jan??
I wouldn't call it a sponsorship but more like an investment 😂
Lmao I love that I just assumed he went with Jaiden and I wasn't wrong
"I cant show this on Stream!" What did you give him, a Dildo????
I feel like the outro for this video hit even harder than normal bro. Awesome video
came for the pokémon and stayed for the crying because jacob feels fulfilled in his life and that is incredible
If I got to do what alpharad did here I would spend way more money on pokemon merch
Japan Mentioned
This man is literally one of the nicest people in the world! He is such an amazing human
alpha: *Reminds me of S/V's Existence me: no. we dont talk about the sonic 06 of nintendo
Imagine getting to watch Gear 5 Luffy live now that is life changing.
1:41 that is a spicy bacon potato pie
AHHHHH I'm crying!! You need to know just how fucking happy you make people. It's clear when you look at your friends that you make their lives better, you make my life better, we are all eager to and grateful to receive your unending kindness. Please always be as happy as you make people. ❤❤❤
25:20 i love this so much no one would understand  just the confidence in "I know the difference" killed me
“Thanks Pokémon for booking me a international flight to see Hatsune Miku”
So we went gonna talk about this 11:14
I can’t wait to go to japan in spring with my family!
Day 4: better known as The Shibuya Incident
images of alpharad kissing man are my favs
Can someone calculate the amount of money he spent
7eleven:😐 7eleven(japan):🎉🎉😁
I’m not gonna get too into it but the segment at the end about appreciating your friends really opened my eyes. So thank you
This had to be the most wholesome YouTube video I've seen in so long I'm happy
Local man visits Place, Japan and suddently fixes their worldview
what a beautiful video
how many pokemon dolls do u have?
this is without a doubt my favourite video youve ever made. So glad to see you be able to honestly say out loud that you are happy, and a person who spends about 20k on their friends shows that you value the real true things in life. So happy for you man you deserve it
Not the persona music in the first minute😭😭
That was a nice video Sanji-San, thank you for sharing this with us!
My heart is melting, what a wonderful thing to do! I hope to find friends I love like you one day <3
this is one of the few videos which I DIDN'T expect an emotional message about being happy about the job u have. Ur doing great Alpharad, keep up the awesome work
I aspire to be as good of a friend as alpharad is to his friends
Turns out the trick to beating Sanji isn't girls, it's merch.
This video got me teary eyed at the end, I knew he bought stuff for others like a lot but I didn’t realize most of them are for others. This was so touching. It's so awesome seeing happy the others were. Literally made my day.
Just realized this was 37 mins ago…
Kissing Jan in a video sponsored by Pokémon is pretty baller I gotta say
Why did I almost cry at the end???
Alpha rlly tried to sneak the enemies to lovers arc with Jan under our noses huh
I live in a country where Nintendo's culture is almost non-existent, and I probably only have one friend who is interested in it. This channel means a lot to me, and the other channels that Jacob runs. Thank you for what you do!
I can't like this video enough. I'm so glad to know that you've found happiness in your life. Thank you for making these videos for all these years, and I hope you keep being happy because, in the end, that's what's important in life.
Don't tell nintendo that he's emulated one of their games. They will send a death squadron of team rocket members to assassinate him.
This just makes me so happy for watching you all this time such a great video and ending \
The only way this gets better for him is if he ends up on Geoguesser again.
the next pokemon event happening in Hawaii could actualy be really good, considering the tragedy that occourd this year having a big even like pokemon could help get a lot of money into the country which could go towards helping recovery, at least I hope thats how things end out
Idk why but seeing Jacob talk about being more happy in life just make me smile so much!
11:14 🤔
Its just like Jacob to spend a lot of money, brag about spending said money, then show us that he didn't spend the money on himself. Jacob should identify as a walking plot twist.
Sanjirad has been born.
11:13 Japanese Karaoke?
This is so wholesome of a video, holy hell.  Also Ima agree, McDonalds in Japan gives nearly 0 acid reflux and goes down easy. And since its so walkable you can just....order more later if you want.
Dude you can't be making me this emotional, I grew up with your stuff and all your weird expirements along the way, and that end was just so heartwarming <3
:)
This was a amazing episode, I can see how much this video meant to alpha. This video really spoke to me in a way that i can put into into my actual life. I'm so glad to know that my favorite youtuber is happy. As a 15 year old that has been stuck and depressed for a very long time and uses one piece as a coping method for how bad my life has been recently, this video truley motivates me to one day do the same as in being such a great person with such a funny and amazing personality and soul, also having such great friends and be able to give them many great gifts of appreciation for just being my friend. I have no "real life friends" and also have MAD social anxiety but all of my online friends mean so much to mean that i can be as happy as having real friends.  Also alpha if you do read this, just know that everybody that watches you (especially me) We love everything you make, i will take in as much alpharad content as much as my life will live on. If you ever take a break, just know that I will wait for however long is needed. If you take a break for legit YEARS, I will wait. Even if you never post again, i will always be happy to know that a great human was able to make something so beautiful.
I'm always scared when people from media start talking about their personnal life but still thanks for everything alpharad, genuine thanks. Hope you will keep everything and everyone you wanna hold to
Just watching Alphrad enjoy himself brings me such joy, and seeing all his friends also smile and scream in happiness from the gifts just- my heart!
i saw those frames of you and pchal making out at karaoke you cant fool me
I’m half Japanese and have gone to Japan at least 5 times, been to most of these areas and know what alpha is talking about, but now I feel bad because I spend way too much time on my phone when I go there 😢. I want to go back to appreciate the place again!!!
omg just finished the video and it was really wholesome. thanks for everything Jacob Alpharad <3
I'm insanely happy for you dude! Glad your trip was so much fun :) it's well-deserved! And what an awesome friend you are for getting all your friends stuff! I hope your wallet will recover from this 😂  *now stop giving me more reasons to go to Japan ya jerk*
Who did alpha kiss?
Omg that was WAYY MORE monny and itams than i thought he got but dammm thats so sweeet he gifted it to his frainds and that speach!! Am so happy for you!
i mean that kid wasnt wrong,  jacob does kinda look like sanji
I wish I could like this video more than once. Hell, at least 5 times.
@Alpharad, i am begging you, play persona 4 golden and pos it on your channel🙏
Congratulations! Hope things continue to go well for you regardless of the path you pursue.
Sorry why is this video just the plot for Yakuza: Like a Dragon and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth?
I’ve been watching your channel since 2016 and that section of the video where you reflect on your time making videos felt really nostalgic and melancholic. Good to hear you’re in a good spot now 👍
I went to the pokemon centre in Tokyo when I was there, the uber driver sounded so disappointed when we pulled up to the shopping centre and without me even mentioning it "the pokemon centre is that way". The last 10 minutes of this were so unbelievably wholesome
Cool video Sanji!
You are a good person Jacob! You really are!
If only I was one of Alpharad’s friends and that he would spend 700$ on Japanese merchandise and give it to me.
That’s so cool
Pause at 11:14
7:25 And this is still leagues cheaper than getting it all on eBay, if the card thing was any indication.
This guy knows his friends so well you love to see it I been waiting for this video come out after seeing you post about it on Instagram It was worth the wait
This is why I don't want to go to Japan. All of my income will be gone, and my shelfs for collectibles would be full.
I didn't know  that I would get such a heart to heart speech from the guy who says forward aireal we love you alpharad  thanks  for being with us for all these years 😊😊
~ 11:14 😳 Get it Jacob. 👏
I really love that you showed each gift reaction. It likely won't ever be as magical as it feels right now, but it's such a thoughtful thing to do, and it was following how you admitted how happy you were. Thanks for sharing that happiness with us, Alpha!
Stop the ending is so cute. I wish I had money to not only go to Japan but also buy a shit load of stuff for me and my friendssss 😭😭
I can't believe they made Japan real after Persona 5 came out
Also yeah i saw that ace thing, you crazy for that one  You look like Sanji fr fr  I would've spent all my money there ngl  You've never had a break?????? So glad you got a vacay and glad you enjoyed that!!
so did you make this video so you can write off all of the things you bought on the trop?
11:14
whats the shirt your wearing
came for the japan vlog, had a whole crisis over the happiness portion
This video turned out to be so much more wholesome than I (or anyone else I believe) could have expected. Thank you. Genuinely, Thank you @Alpharad
my heart is so warm after this, thanks man
jesus i feel so much pain watching him go through his materialistic enjoyment for more materialistic Enjoyment
Incredible
SANJI?!
1:49  Oh yeah that’s right you got food poisoning
Ah yes.. Japan is my favorite place to buy my pornography and hatsune miku tickets. You know maybe I only buy the miku e tickets because I like her por-
That's how i want to have my life. To be able spent a shitton of money on me and my friends
👍
OH NO!
came to the comments just to see people talking about alpha and PC making out but nobody said nothing yet???? DID I ONLY SEE THAT OR-
I'll learn and know my friends as well as Jacob Alpharad knows the people around him. I'm glad I have an influencer who inspire me like you.
ayo 11:14????
This video made me cry. Congrats on the mental health improvements!
Jacob not only had an awesome dream vacation, he got a lot of cool stuff, got to see the Pokémon world championship, got to see an awesome Miku concert, he sent a lot of cool stuff to his friends. Jacob is definitely one of kind, not only as a content creator, but also a person, and friend.
The most heartwarming flex video on youtube.
The bit with all of his friends opening their gifts is so sweet and heartwarming. The absolute joy he brought to so many people has me crying happy tears 🥹 ❤
I have a sneaking suspicion that we are about to be getting alot of content on the way.
When it comes to McDonald's in Poland, it's average, I would say, because I don't remember exactly when I ate there.
I’m glad that you’re happy
This turns into a very wholesome experience. Thank you Jacob.
I love how your MacDonald's tier list has the United Kingdom at the top of A tier (which is a country made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Island) and then you also list Scotland at the bottom of A tier (which is in the aforementioned United Kingdom).  I'm assuming the top of A tier is supposed to be England? In which case you needed to use the English flag (white background with a red cross) to not confuse your United Kingdom viewers  /End silly Geography nitpick in a Japan video
I watched through the entire sponsor segment of hen I realized, I don’t have scarlet and/or violet 😂
It means you need Jesus bro
I was in Japan for Worlds and tried so desperately to find you and Jaiden for a picture but couldn't :( but had a great time first time back at a worlds since 2015 and my 2nd time in Japan, glad you enjoyed your trip!
Good to see an Alpha vod and the success he got from Pokémon, proud of this human with his work
Alpha your'e such a badass
11:14 peak enemies to lovers
11:14 is gold
GO WHITE BOY GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“next we went to shibuya” I immediately had jjk flashback
alpharad 😐  alpharad in japan 🤩🤩🤩
Its been a wild 10 years, i remember seeing each of those videos as they came out. Ive grown up and have a full time job and everything. I never noticed how quickly times would change and yet here I am, still watching Alpharad.
14:53 I case you were wandering there was some fires in Hawaii when this was made
Ngl you kinda do look like sanji
question: for them one piece fans how far are you I’m 350 but it grows fast
Yoooo, who would have thought Fir would show up in this video!
Yay friendship!
maybe i did cry a little bit i love you dude
Toda Raba, thank you very much
Super based Alpharad here
damn, that karaoke night tho.
Why does Jacob sound like he's talking through a traffic cone?
Song at 6:07?
He just got called Sanji and yeah he kinda looks like him haha 10:20
Those last 10 minutes gotta be some of the most wholesome content I've ever seen  So nice of you to spend that much money on mainly your friends and make their days and lives better
Chingo😊
I'm so happy that you had the vacation of your life in Japan. :)
This is a long shot, but you think it's possible to stream and do what you do on a semi decent gaming laptop? Been watching YouTube content since 07 and always wanted to do it but never sure how to start since I've had to work a full time job unlike a lot of the bigger names who started when they were young or in school. Any advice?
The entire second half of the video was beautiful. Thank you Jacob Alpharad.
damn this shit was mad wholesome. cheers jacob!
This is my spending spree in a nutshell
This was just absolutely beautiful. I'm not even afraid to admit it. I cried for a man that doesn't even know I exist and I'm not sorry
Thank You Pokémon for Flying out Alpha to Japan . This Video and The Work he puts to these are so Amazing and You can tell he Pours his Soul out for each and Every single one of them . This Event looked so Special and he Got the Chance to literally share it with everyone. I don’t even know where I am Going with this but I am Genuinely very happy and Crying at the Moment for the Amazing time Alpha had . Thank you and All of your hard work after all these years and Hopefully everyone continues to support him . ( Also let’s not forget how much fun Alpha Had during Karaoke 👀)
If you are happy then I am happy
I’m happy for you dawg, keep chasing what makes you happy.
Now that i think about it, Alpharad does bear a strinking resemblance to Sanji.  Huh
hey I am going to japan next month. got an tips?
i was in that exact airport at the same time broski
It's been an honor to watch you for the past 8 years and see how you've grown through my phone
Legit have me tearing up at the end. The generosity to your friends is what I strive to do.
Your accountant must've had a field day
i think the end sold me on the fact that alpharad probably is one of my favorite people ever. and i haven't even met him in person. crazy
Man that ending was just so wholesome. <3 Can really tell how much you love your friends, Jacob, and how much they love you, too. <3
Great video, Sanji-San! lol
omg not the unintentional Sanji cosplay 😂😂😂
I have EXACTLY the same Dragonair plush and got it from an arcade machine in Tokyo Skytree. It cost me like 15 dollars but hey, is my dog's favoruite one now.
Happy for you Jacob (or Alpharad, whatever), I've been watching you since I was 10, and I've watched the amount of progress your channel has made over the course of my life. A little weird coming from an internet stranger, but I'm glad finally gave yourself a break and filled the hole in your heart with copious amounts of Pokemon and One Piece merchandise. Anyway, been a fan for a while, and just wanted to say love your content, and thoughts and prayers for your financial stability.
Man, you're an awesome dude. I'm glad that you can live your life to the fullest & bring joy to your viewers & more importantly to your friends & family. This video made me really happy. The joy on your friends face showing that you really know them well is solid proof of what they meant to you. Bravo
was that Jacob and Jan kissing tho
The ending was so wholesome
The ending put the biggest smile on my face. Needed that
not only did he get things for all of his friends, but knew what all of them liked, down to their favorite pokemon. what a good friend alpha is :)
The funniest thing is that I am going back to Iowa on the 10th
this rocks so hard
11:14 🤔
Yeah the tokyo capcom pokemon and ni tendo stores are all like 5 feet from eachother and they hurt my wallet...
I literally was crying for that last section😭😭😭 this video really made me step back and think about my life. How I’m managing, what I do, and who my friends are. It really means the world that Alpharad is here. He’s helped me in so many ways and he 1000% deserved this vacation. Thank you Alpharad. For everything. Take as much time/rest as you need. We love you and always will.💯👑
Not an anime person or vtubers but this was an awesome video
The moment I realized where the ending was going I actually started crying. Showing those you care about how much they really matter to you is always the best feeling, and it just makes my heart so happy to see you doing it too. Thank you.
It honestly shows how much of a great person you are with the entire last quarter of the video. Spending all this money and giving back to all the people who've supported you throughout your career. I'm so glad you're happy Mr. Funnyman, you deserve it. And this video is proof of that. >:3
you should go to nagashima spa land. (and hotel nagashima) best themeland and food.
bestending ever
sanji san is a addict
EARLY!!!
this whole video is really heart warming with u experiencing ur dream place to visit and giving amazing gifts to ur friends and just overall making us realize that we can all do it too if we put in the time and dedication into the things we love❤❤
Ion got notnin to say bruh this was just a feel good video
japan
Alpharad, Please never change, you are in fact one of the best YouTubers I have known. I’ve been subscribed as far back as 10k, and just seeing your story grow over these years has been amazing, and honestly you inspired me to start my own story. I know you might not ever see this comment but Thank you for everything, and I can’t wait to see what the future has in store for you!
This whole video was awesome, the twist at the end really was sweet
Errrrm I mean you viewers also help you so like errrrm I don’t wana be that guy but…….. I like One Piece and Pokémon soooooo.. just kidding bro love the video and I’m glad you are happy your videos bring me joy when ever I watch them ❤❤😊
God I love you alpharad
THIS MAN IS SO KIND FOR NO REASON
11:14 👁👁
11:13 ALPHA
Comment to help you out financially
I like your shirts
This is genuinely adorable, good to see how you've grown Jacob, keep in goin.
Wow, this guy rlly just got flown to japan and paid to talk about one of his favourite game series. I have never been happier
I’m going through living hell and watching all of alpha’s friends opening their presents and being so happy brought me to tears but good tears instead of terrible tears and yeah. Thank you for that
This video is so heartwarming!  Thank you for all you do Alpha :)
I love to know that your happy with your life and that you are generous thank you so much for being who you are
Omg you’re that one guy from one piece
Hearing you say that you were happy, made me cry a bit; you deserve that above all and as the stupid parasocial YouTube commenter, I'm super happy for you
The Netherlands a C tier!?
this video genuinley wants to make me work harder at being an artist just so one day i can just say fuck it we ball, buy a shit ton of merch for myself and a shit ton of merch for my friends and not be finanically destroyed  thanks for the inspiration man
ALPHARAD WEARING THE SAME VAPOR95 SHIRT I OWN WAS A JUMPSCARE
Mad props to alpharad to pay for pokemon's next championship prize in merch
:)
I'm so glad I've been a fan as long as I have I love how I've been able to see you grow as a creator your content has diversified so much since those years ago. keep being amazing Alpha
Me coment me monkey brain
I want a overview over everything you bought!!!
I just couldn't stop smiling watching this whole video. Especially the ending.
Alpharad is so generous, he's like the Mr Beast of Youtube ☺
You are literally stabbing my heart, I’m so jealous of you, glad you were able to get all your stuff and kill your wallet! Also you look like your the best friend any YouTuber could ask for…
What the fuck this was one of the sweetest videos ever and I'm crying????
Actually watching the entire thing and getting slapped with raw emotion, this was an incredible video. Real glad for Jacob.
Alpharad is the reason Japan is a first world nation
a child thought jacob was sanji thats pretty crazy but you cant blame him its just a child great video tho
We all love you. We may all just be strangers on the internet, but you've impacted millions, and you can always step back and take a break.
Sexy kiss tho
This man deadass spent the last like 7 minutes burying his friends with random nerd crap.  ...I wish I could bury my friends with nerd crap.
Do a one piece card unboxing
Honestly... That entire ending made me cry a bit.
This just helps me realise that Japan as a whole is always at least 3 steps ahead of the rest of the world at all times.
this is all just a plan for Jacob to get invited to more events by advertising his spending addiction
It sounds like he needed a break for a while
Thanks for the silly little videos
Glad to hear you are in a better spot mentally Alpha. I was fortunate enough to head to Japan last year and it was amazing. I’m at the ending right now and desperately choking back tears. This was such a kind gesture and I’m sure your friends really appreciate it. Hopefully you get to take more time for yourself in the future!
peace and love ❤️
4:48 JAPAN DR.PEPPER that confirms it im going to japan
I love it! The ending, I love! This is amazing!
I loved this video
11:14 o-oh 😳
Wholesome
Watching this video was extremely worth my time😄
Pokemon Is so awesome how nice of them
Congratulations Jacob!  I can't click the sponsorship link just so you know.
Hope you and jaiden had fun😊
That speech about your growth as a creator and a person was beautiful.
Hiroshima and Nagasaki
I love ace of hearts getting represented on the main channel🫶
It feels great watching this knowing about almost everything that Jacob is about to experience for the first time. Japan is one hell of a consumer goods trap, you will spend your money and you will enjoy it.
The fact I was about to start saving like $40,000 for merch in Japan before I saw the ending 😭
Good. I've noticed a happier uptick with you, and it's made your content better
yo at 6:17 is that PokemonChallenges?
That message at the end was beautiful, I've been following you for many years and I'm glad to finally be able to hear you happy
11:14  caught Alpharad lacking
We need the house tour
NANI?!
This has a really wholesome ending (won't spoil) 😊
42 MINUTES?!?!
no way jacob kissed pchal
we love you alpharad <3 take care of your self
I have one piece permanently on the brain so when you said a kid called you san-ji-san i immediately thought of the goat sanji
Trash taste ?
the emotional whiplash in this holy shit
He moves his face like the characters in mortal Kombat 1
Dutch mcdonalds really fell off after their stupid recipe change. It used to be so good.
this is all just one big subliminal message to buy Nintendo merch, isn't it
My fight or flight response activated as soon as that one piece pirate warriors 4 menu music kicked in
I've been watching you since 2018, I've seen, plus, gold, HDWGH the whole library. Your smash ultimate reactions dropping into my recommended single handedly got me back into Nintendo and through that, I've met some incredible people who I consider some of my closest friends.  Hearing you say, "I'm happy" it feels so rewarding. Thank you so much for the years of entertainment you've given me. Its awesome
awesome
This is the most detailed tax write off I've ever seen. Lol glad you had a good time
You know Alpharad?  You might Visit Costa Rica again for those MCD burgers again, they changed the recipes here xD
oh im crying at the ending ok wasnt expecting that :')
Based.
Wait no, you being recognized as SANJI is so cute  EDIT: I want to be that kind of person at the end of this video.
Pokémon sponsoring a pokémon nerd is a massive brain move because they'll give all the money directly back to buy merch
LOL
Hello this is you accountant and we have seen you bank account an you have made several  unscheduled purchases.
he kissed jan... but ofcourse
Interesting choice to put the Scottish flag *and* the union flag - glad to know Alpharad is pro independence
the persona music made me laugh everytime
......... I can't unsee alpharad sanji
i went to like all the places he went how did i miss alpharad 😔
8:41 I’M CRYING 😭
this video makes me want to spend money now......
As someone who has also had to buy additional luggage in Japan because of merch addiction, I salute you 🫡 it was so sweet watching all of your friends at the end!
Okay I cried with the ending lol
Hiroshima
I went to that Nintendo store in Japan. I agree it was a mistake/virtue to go there
Its a good week of Alpharad Videos. Your so amazing, ive admired for so long! Keep going Alpharad!
Wait Sanji One Piece has a youtube channel?
Just keep up what your doing and don't push yourself because people love your content me included. It was sick what you did for all your friends as well
We love you Alpharad!
It would be so interesting to travel to places like this if flying wasn't absolutely terrifying
SWEDEN MCDONALDS S TIER?!?!?! 18 years of living in sweden and i have not had one good mcdonalds. You won some kind of rng for sure.
Honestly, the whole bit at the end was so heartwarming, seeing how much not only everyone appreciates you, but how much you know them with what gifts you gave, awesome shit Mr funnyman<3
Place Japan real!
Konichiwhat's up
Honest question, why  this guy makes so much videos about how much money he can spend irresponsibly?
That miku merch looks sooo fucking good, wish I could get some
Not the illegal Jan X Jacob footage
Persona 5  is just like u, you show your true self and by doing what you love you remember what forged you, which memories you remember and by having great people you have by your side you can overcome everything. . .
Alpharad. I have been a big fan of you for years. Anytime someone as ask me who is my is my favorite YouTuber I always say: Jocab alpharad. The last 12 minutes of the video it showed me how much you’ve helped me and probably so many people. I would say so much more, but I’m lazy. So what I want to say.   Alpharad you are the best and my favorite YouTuber. Thank you so much for making content for us, and I’m excited to see what in the future. We all love you alpha. Keep on being yourself and being so fucking awesome!  + you are a real one.
Pokemon knew what they were doing
11:14.5
The talk about your journey throughout the years on YouTube honestly made me a bit teary eyed. You’re seriously a massive inspiration for me and I’m happy to see you living life to the fullest
As a Scottish guy, I really appreciate the distinction between Scotland and the UK in your tier list
Next up you should come to Brazil
I went to Japan recently, can highly recommend, it has something for everyone, provided you can walk a lot and take trains a lot. Knowing some Japanese can be really helpful, everyone going should at least learn Katakana and get an offline OCR translator on their phone imo.  My trip was very unlike Alpharad's, I did visit plenty of the places he mentioned but bought less than $50 on merch over my whole trip (approx. 25 days).  I visited Hiroshima, Kyoto, Nara, and main based in Tokyo.  Climbed Mt. Fuji to the real summit and down in a day (there's a real summit and a kind of summit that's actually not that many people stop at).  Visited plenty of anime stuff.  Even though I'm vegan with the use of the happy cow app/site I had no trouble finding fully vegan places in Tokyo nearby at almost all times, and in every city there were at least vegan options. This honestly surprised me after how many horror stories I've heard, and yes let's more foods did have dairy/egg in e.g. melon pan.
11:14 🤨🤨🤨 don’t think you could hide that from us jacob
Alpharad talking about how happy and how much better it is now for him mentally is so wholesome!!
Alpharad is one of the best content creator and people alive
Tbf to that kid, i can see the resemblance
T H E F R A M E 11:14
14:51 can someone expalin why thats ill timed
I hope that whatever you end up doing, you keep doing what makes you happy. Never feel pressure from us to do something you don't want to do. I love your content.
11:14 You want to see this
lmfao the split second of alpharad and pchal kissing
bro was kissing that dude crazy
11:14 HUHH?? and WHATT?? i got jumpscared by that
I'm sorry when you said you were happy, I let out the biggest grin imaginable. Happy for you dude
miku segment made me so unbelievably jealous
That frame 11:14 bro kissed a man
The mad lad actually bought the giant one piece statue, absolutely wild but yet somehow not surprising.  Edit: the fact that the last almost ten minutes was showcasing that nearly everything he bought was for his friends is one of the biggest most wholesome plot twists ive ever seen
I was expecting like "I bought 5 plushies, im so addicted" but seeing the full suitcases was like some sort of childhood dream!
Alpha opening up to us in a video about his irrational spending and pokemon is so out of character and wholesome, i love it Hope you can keep up your mental health and manage to take more fun breaks Thank you for making us smile and laugh with every single video
Pokemon: hey alpha, we likme the videos you make and want to invite you to worlds Alpha: Cool! *pays them back in merch sales and gets hammered* (happy you got a vacation fr though)
Weeb
omg gojo and geto are in the thumbnail AND he went to shibuya....
This gives me pure joy
Aussie maccas s tier lets goooooo
I don't want to sound like an asshole this video is very wholesome but how much all together did you spend!?!?
I'm glad you had a great time Jacob, You've earned it for all your hard work.
Alpharad is Sanji confirmed lol
I waited soooo long for this <3
totally didnt change the video speed to 0.25 to be sure of what I saw. There's nothing to see here.
Alpharad and not making out with his guy friends in a video challenge: Impossible
is it possible to subtract too much from your taxes as a business expense?
11:14 ?
I’m happy Alpha had a change of viewing life and being happier now! WOO GO JACOB!!
You're telling me Jacob went to Japan and didn't mention anything Persona even once?? Woah.
This was an epic video
I hate to laugh during the mental health segment but one of the upset clips was from the chicken video
Me patiently waiting to see when Jiaden would develop Cucurucho faze
Plz do a Japan Haul, would be so fun
I audibly gasped when the $1807 came up
I went to Japan last year, and it was great! I wish I went when worlds happened, since I love pokemon! Then again, I went to 3 different pokemon centers.
I am commenting so alpha gets more money
hm
As Dutch person, Dutch McDonalds is straight up F-tier, please change your tierlist
Proof that money can buy happiness
27 minutes of Jacob Alpharad being beat up by capitalism and liking it
Early gang 👇
I bought a 27k Yen Figurine in Japanese 😂
Highlight of the vid 11:14
11:14 if you slow it down you can see he was kissing another guy
7:25 Let's be honest, If you were in Jacobs position, would you spend this kind of money on pokemon merch?
The McDonalds tier list has me questioning everything
11:14 I saw that clip 🤨
I warn people if I ever go to japan I might never come back 😂
Alpharad wanna explain what happend at 11:11
ireland mentioned 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I can see why Alpharad was the most drunk. Because wow
Ah so this is how Jaiden got those plushies that have now turned into something much more than plushies.
Alpharad if you look in the bottom right corner of the fortnite chart you can see a little game I have asked you to play about once or twice it is called yo kai watch
11:13 that is crazy
trust me everyone, its 11:14 you want to watch
Everyone ask me "how much money you need to have when you're going to Japan" and the only answer is "normally around 3k USD including airplane ticket for 3 weeks without being obliged to save on each step, but if you're weeb - credit card debt is the limit". There is so much thing to "waste" money on like sitting 8 hours in arcade and destroying locals in Tekken or Initial D Arcade, buying gatcha, console games, gaming consoles (fun fact, new PS5 in Japan even after paying import taxes is 2x times cheaper than in my country), anime figurines, mangas, shady DVD's from basement stores - you name it. I am intentionaly not mentioning eating, because main problem here is stomach capacity not money, because food for me were extremely cheap in Japan while I know that other nations complains about prices of japanese food, but in my country cheapest meal option, in cheapest bar not even a restaurant cost around 15USD while durning 3 weeks in Japan I can count on fingers of 1 hand how many times I ate meal in restaurant for more than 10USD and usually that was options like kobe beef or fancy japanese burgers. So when you're going to Japan and you want to respect your hard earned money first rule - DON'T BE WEEB - or you will be that guy on airport for return flight that have 6 suitcases only for himself.
I don’t know why but that add read actually hooked me
11:13 So in the violet soul link Jan wasnt kidding about them becoming lovers
Other countries McDonald's is always a fun way to see a worse or better version of your local McDonalds
Buy mother 3 or play it
I stayed home and also spent too much money on Pokemon stuff.
alpharad singlehandedly boosted the japanese economy tenfold
E
YOU WATCHED 1072 LIVE IN JAPAN? WTF?
11:14
I’m happy you’re happy. Also, hands down that jacket is the best thing ever!
🦫
I like the fact that some kid literally thought you were Sanji from one Piece
Are we not gonna talk about this? 11:14 🤣🤣🤣
I love how Alpharad and Jaiden are basically non romantic life partners at this point, greatest anime non couple in history
11:14 care to explain jacob??
11:14 what happend
11:14 hit pause
11:13 is like... Nice
Love the less than 1 sec cut before Day 5. Knew how you felt about him Alpha
goofy man puts holes in his wallet for 27 minutes straight.
Man I wish I had irresponsible amounts of money to spend irresponsibility
I'm crying - This is so wholesome!!! :')
The Netherlands in C tier? Is the reason I hate McDonalds just cuz they're shit here?
Long winded way of asking us to watch the next few videos with adblock off
Thought he was gonna say Shibuya the place where gojo died
I see san ji
Not surprised about the Jan and Alpha bromance escalating at 11:14
I saw that Day 5 Alpha
Look at this addiction isn’t it beautiful  Yes Jacob buying anything anime related is beautiful  I wish I could spend that much money on all my favorite anime Merch
for those wondering what Jaiden's fixation was... QSMP and Cucurucho. that's all i want to tell. But i'm glad you got to enjoy Japan. And I'm glad you're feeling happy again.
the constant animal products really kill the mood man.
Thank you for making me feel better about my crippling plushie addiction.
this is just jacob and jaiden when you leave them unattended
Man you really getting into pokemon has been the best thing ever😊
"the goal of this video isnt to flex my finnancial incompetence, it's a cry for help" Actually its purpose is a tax writeoff but we get the jist
257th
11:14  would you like to explain us, what happened?
Alpha time
"Its a fucking vending machine"-alpharad
accidentally ordering an egg is definitely a language barrier moment
Satosugu in the thumbnail
11:14  so happy for you alpha ❤️
Jacob has not only been sponsored by Google, has not only been confronted by the official Sonic the Hedgehog account, but he got sponsored by Pokémon. I'm proud that after years on YouTube, the big guns are scouting you out. Jacob, keep making good shit, and おめでとう。
I feel like arson.
Jacob being as responsible as ever i see
245th
Cool, I have no money and can never go to Japan.
11:14
i would spend all my money too
Wow
How in the world does the funny man do an ad for POKEMON
8:14 it’s gojover
11:14 At this point, Jacob could have all of Berlin when he’s wasted.
Man, how awesome would it have been to have a photo taken of your magnemite and a card made of it, replacing the usual picture?
Relatable
hello
1:31 since when did Jacob visit ireland?
Wait... so did Pokémon company just pay Jacob  so that he could pay them a good percentage of it back.
SANJI-SAN OMG ❤ that is too adorable
Pokémon I should have known
Through all this time, I did not make the Sanji and Alpharad connection and it’s crazy
"Everything Here Is Like Fortnite" Alpharad 2023
This is what the pokemon company like to call, a return on investment
Japan? That place isn't America tf is that
2:07 "Nihongo Jouzu" We have Dogen to thank
Seeing Mexico in McDonalds A tier made me unreasonably hyped
worth it
Granting creators early access to a merch store is a great idea.
OHHHHH HES GOTTA MCDONALDS TIER LIST TOO NO SHOT I thought I was the only one… but no shot you put uk in a tier that shit is bottom tier, rest of the tier list checks out but… cmon mam
“everything here is like fortnite”
19 Dollar Fortnite card
Honestly a great country, The views and culture is like no other
Nice! Video about capitalism and spending money when inflation is at an all time high!
Mr. Krabs approves
Was that Ohara?
Watching Jacob do a YouTube sponsorship for the MAINLINE Pokémon games has to be the most uncanny thing I've ever experienced on this platform
Coincidentally, my family and I went to Japan basically the same time you guys went. Not running into you guys was the saddest part of the trip. So it was only a 9.99/10 trip
hey jacob you should ask jaiden to contact to contact tommyinnit and then tommyinnits freinds and that to that to that
My husband left me
God I hate that Pokemon would literally steal all my money with the power of good merchandise...
Thanks for the foreshadowing, it delivered.
hi future me
pokemon desperate after releasing that "game'
Hiroshima
I wish I could be happy.
Glad I am not the only one who completed the teal mask dlc Pokédex
one day, i shall go to japan to do the exact same thing
Completely unrelated but I need that fucking hawaiian shirt right god damn now
HOLY SHIT ULTRAMAN BLAZAR IN AN ALPHARAD VIDEO FOR A SECOND

I mean your not wrong, Australian McDonald's is good af.
Cool, I'll make a good comment in 25 minutes when I've finished the video
I've never been this early
where the fuck did you have bad Norwegian fast food
alpharad is now alphasad
I love when Alpharad uploads as frequently as this...
Alpha post Alpha post
omg
Why does the persona music actually just fit so perfectly with everything
Hi jo!
Do you like One Piece?
Konechewa Alpha San. Saynoraya Alpha San.
I can tell there was some effort put into the thumbnail. You can see Spy x Family and One piece in it.
Damn Pokémon themselves sponsored him
Lets goooo
150th comment
MORE VENDING MACHINES
Truly the Jacob moment of all time
Australia in S for the Macca's tierlist makes sense, we're carried by frozen fantas but we move
Alpharad, spending too much money, nooo thats impossible (he's spent thousands if I recall on Fire Emblem Heroes ) wait this video is so wholesome
so funny to me that japan = persona music
2:53 dont think I dont recognize that Pirate Warriors 4 music, im happy
I feel like all the Persona music really enhanced the experience, thank you funny internet man
wHeReS JAdeN????
Mad props to Alpharad for having a children’s game sponsor a full blown vacation to Japan, and then dropping the video about it where you mention porn in the first three minutes. Masterful gambit sir.
No matter how much he tries to deny it, Alpharad is the epitome of the "Place, Japan" meme.
I wish i could spend this sort of money
What a great video! Sure hope the creator of it isnt blonde!
bro gets a thousand views a minute
Pokémon is genuinely amazing for doing this for you.
the title is self explanatory
Hello alpha
I’m putting this comment here now and editing this when he says he went to the Pokémon Center and bought too much there.
I love how whenever someone goes to Japan, one of their first instincts is just “Mcdonald’s” 😭
WHO flew you out?!?!?
❤❤❤❤
As I look at his insta stories occasionally, i already know how fucking incredibly irresponsible this man will purchase in this video
Can't believe Alpharad went to Place, Japan
Hoping and praying for a trash taste collab
this was so level five gyat skibidi rizz temu what the dig doing sigma ohio core, great job💕💕
I gotta see jo and Jacob play ctr nitro fuelled on gold
When Pokemon itself gives you a HM02 Fly.
after watching a second of this video, I can confirm he went to Japan and spent to much money
hi
Finally. Jacob’s irresponsibility part 143
I am gay
Gets flown out to Japan by the Pokémon company themselves  Immediately goes and tries McDonalds
Pokémon HIMSELF? Are you assuming Pokémon’s gender?
Seeing zoro in the thumbnail just going somewhere else in Japan is so on character and funny
Прикольное видео, Джейкоб! Жду еще крутяцких видосиков
He went to the place one piece was made, what an epic chimichungus moment
les go new alpharad vid
666 baby let’s gooo
It’s a good day when alpharad uploads
The Pokemon Company knew that they were making money with all the merch bought when they contacted Alpha, smart move Pokemon
Honestly I feel like the title would be anyone haha. I would personaly spend waaaay too much because god damn being in Japan would be such an opportunity haha.
Japan breaks everyones money
I heart alpharad !! :3 I heart alpharad videos !! >0<
Havent watched the vid yet, this man better have just bought everything, along with jaiden
Honesty Jacob, just having a section of the video about giving his friends gifts is the most wholesome shit ever.
Aphlard ublode :grammar:
I hope we can see alpharad in a upcoming ep of trash taste
Alternate title: I joined the other millions of people in the Japanese crane game addiction.
👆Sanji-san!!
Finally a new video!!
Omg, Japan real?!
Hi
ostentation is a terrible trend to follow
Can’t wait to see what you and Jaiden did in Japan
Not gonna lie,  I’m not surprised.
i wish i could go to Japan to spend a Ridiculous amount of money and most likely lose my mind :D
I did the same this summer😭🙏

Can never spend too much?

I would love to go to Japan someday
I think the problem was that you spent too little money
