Is that second singer Dave Chappelle?! 😂
Whether she sees this comment or not, this goes out to Bridget Cassidy for being exactly the most toxic woman I ever dated!
must've spent 35 45 thousand up in Tiffany's OH NO😂
I remember singing this with a friend at a karaoke place in late 2021. We planned for me to play dead like Anderson Paak and made a few people laugh. I recommend trying this! 😂😂😂
Superb music and video!
Man they kill it all together.
Aiaght, you guys got me
Show !!!¡!
This song makes me wish it were 2004 again man.
1:01 that's my favorite part
O melhor disso tudo é que não é IA ❤
You are braver than you think, stronger than you feel, and more capable than you realize!
I’m 61 years old but these guys give me new energy with this nice music, great music!
I'm still here y'all 🙏🏾
Bruno has the best voice ❤😊
😎🤘 🪟
I busted my head open singing this song at Karaoke. And I dont regret it
How am I late to this hotness…?
Mars, my kids have liked your music.  You intentionally try to mimic MJ, which has been a good thing, since no one else has any chance.  You have produced music appriopriate and fun for all.  Please don't F it up, in creeping down this hole.  Thanks.

This is the result of leaving the door open. Now you smoking out a window 😂😂😂😂...knowing you should just let her skate.

To this day I die every time I see Anderson Pak laid out on the floor😂😂😂😂
🧚‍♀️🪄
SEE!!!!! Who made the lyrics!
Still GOAT
So quem e brasileiro vai curtir e responder
This floor is poor oh shit
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This song had so much going for it. Idk why he didnt keep this vibe
Nah! They Anderson was laid out like a dead body!!Then popped back in the camera like a ghost...Floored
only they could be dressed like Motown royalty while dragging somebody's daughter in 4K HD ... and the way they harmonized the disrespect 😂 grammy worthy !
This song is smoooooothing
Un genio .Bruno ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Dude on the floor wanting to die!  Had me dying 🤣 Love this song Bruno and Paak!  Great cut!!
Love the incorporation of his Mexican heritage here, love the dansa del Diablo reference
Entertainment center
istg Bruno himself is the definition of AURA. AURA itself is BRUNO MF MARS omgggg. It´s outstanding how it could exist a being, not human being, i'm literally sayin BEING, that has more aura than SGA but here we are Mr Mars, period ig.
I love this fun, especially when he fell on the floor and then all of a sudden he come back  in the video and starts to singing...lol
Bruno is just so damn talented 🎉
The greatest album of this decade
❤La canción perfecta para mis oídos 😍
Oh my gosh, This song is the best song that I have the pleasure to listen!! Congratulations to take out this wonderful song Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak
💜💜💜💜
HAPPY 4 YEAR ANNIVERSARY TO AN EVENING WITH SILK SONIC!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
2025 🎉
Back in 2025. I had Bruno Mars day at work. 4 years has flown by.
Listening to this song again after 4 years, and I still think it’s the national anthem for all the incel simper weebs who’ve gone through their oshis graduating or retiring.
So ready for a SS tour !!!! ❤
❤

2025 anyone??
1:35
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE….PURE JOY!  Lightning does strike twice.  He’s even BETTER than the legendary Michael Jackson.   I’m loving this group.  Such talent is extremely rare.  This is the best group I’ve heard in years.
2025 this song still funny
Love the old school vibe, groovy mellow sound
Magnífico !! 🤤🤤♥️♥️♥️♥️🫠
Bruno Mars put so much emphasis on "this bish" it was classic when they cut the music to amplify his delivery.
It's gotta be
💗💖💝 T I F F A N Y ! 💝💖💗
"BRING BACK THE SOUL"
Lembra Michael Jackson essa dupla
Anyone in November?👇
I hear a young MJ when listening to Bruno mars
Perfecto
If Bruno mars was stronger he would be great for the smashing machine part instead of the rock  js
YESTERDAY MARKS THE 4 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THIS MASTERPIECE!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Haha love this song November anyone?
It's a good song that you make me laugh every time when I listen to it if I don't be falling on the floor and you'll be singing a lot and it makes me smile

2:32 is my favorite part 2:45 💛 I can’t believe I didn’t hear this song before it was shared with me
Oh yes
00100
1:55- The song is testimony for the Delilah type women who do this to men. Also the foolish Samson men who allow user behavior to happen to them like this. Similar to what Penny did to Leonard for a long time in Big Bang Theory.
Did Corey Holcomb write these lyrics???
OMG MY NEW FAV SONG BRU

OMG!!!! Bruno Mars is just so hot. Bruh. Can't hold it in sometimes. It spills out halfway through the song.  (⸝⸝> ω <⸝⸝) ILY BRUNO-CHAN!!. Anderson could be a fun third. You feel me.
R&B '70
Collaborations across languages tap into global trends
BRO. Man I was looking at KPop the other day and I had the thought: "We used to do this group music thing in the US back in the day and we gave it up!"   Then here these guys come along and just reinvigorate the magic of it. ITS HITS DIFFERENT.

Este menino não só fenomeno, é a reencarnação, vêm com uma missão linda, não só se corropa, ñ macule o que, nomes, figuras você está nos trazendo do baú, ou feche-o. E desapareça. Não nos faça sofrer, hoje, não concidero o que " vomitam" dizendo ser " música". Não nos decepcine.❤
I gave away smoking because I don't want to ruin my singing voice, Mr Mars. ❤😅
Regularly updated videos (e.g., top lists) maintain traffic

เอาๆไปไหนไปกัน 👍👍👍🎅🙄
Stupid lady, all we had to do was be together. Now that we are it's too much.
Ese es peru tiene talento, jajaja, negro hvn
🔥🔥🔥
Because I have half American blood, my life is not lonely like this Thailand Illumination song.
😂😂😂😂
0:32 to 1:44
This is a WILD departure from the first Hollow Knight. I really don't understand the hype,  but I'll wait until I play it to judge.
1:08 yikes dont know who you know but hey could be wrong.
The new. Jackson's 5!! New wannabes.. there 😮xx
Yes
It’s a dirty song but it’s good as fuck
Went to Seychelles, got divorced the moment after return. Talk about irony and a dumbass not knowing his wife.
�Top 10� or list formats remain evergreen
😂
Eu amo as músicas
I was 10 when I was on the set for this. One of my uncle was one of the camera man
Last September I was in love and singing this song with him.  This September I'm alone and going through a devastating breakup.  I just hope that in september 2026 I'm healed.  ❤
win
Saw them in Vegas and I am a older woman and I loved every moment, need to go back just Bruno Mars 😂 I went back but I was leaving Vegas when his residence was starting ❤

0:46 Anyone smokin out the window in 2026? 😂🔥
2025
smoking during the song on stage . love it
R kels all day!!!!
Bruno, Anderson and the team, tell me one thing please. How do you guys do this?
Oh man this woman doesn’t deserve him he does everything for her and she doesn’t appreciate him… she for the streets lol
It's the "this ich" that had my howling.  I mean I felt it in my soul 😂😂😂😂😂 The dropped to the floor and pop up on the next verse was excellent.
"i wanna die " and Anderson .Paak was actually lying donw on the floor🤣
❤
This song is the last song I will dedicate to my ex you know who you are
1:43 hahahhahahaha
😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
❤amooo
I love it❤
Is this what men sing about to blame their shady behaviour?
🍯
I love this song 🫶 Love the lyrics 🫶
*_Must have spent 35, $45,000 on a Pekingese (oh no!)_*  Anyone else change lyrics to make songs about their dog? 🐶❤😂
Eu amo tanto.❤
Been playing in my mind for a whole ass year
Hilarious!!!!!!
Timeless classic! Love me some Silk Sonic.
I don’t know what Bruno is doing right now with his life. He could easily be bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars just from touring. This man is literally wasting a billion dollar voice at this point. If I were him, I’d try my hardest to pull a Taylor swift and re-record all his past albums. because i know for a fact that his voice is probably at its prime right now and is currently unmatched even among the female artists today.
Best song by Bruno Mars, what a banger and beautiful track 🔥
Crazy how I just found this after my very first girlfriend broke up with me not even a week the break up,she found someone else to replace me with 😭😅 I low-key gave that girl every part of me just for her to drop me,find someone else to replace me,and tell her friends that I'm insecure and toxic
2025🎉
girl ?? smaud23232
I know that I am not the only one who thinks about a certain girl while listening to this song 🥲
1:44 Anderson just laying there 😅😅😅
Is it me or does the 2nd dude that come in look like a dolled up Arron The Plumber?
This will never get old, they did their big one on this
Classic we need another Silk Sonic album 🔥
Somebody has to make a Spider-Man comic edit with this
Alguém em 2025 ?😊❤
CELIBACY
*dating in your 30's 😂😂
Had to unlike it  just like it again
Probably one of the greatest videos of all time. 😅🎉🎉
These 2 are so talented ..I love this whole CD...real music ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
AYE! I don't know how many times I've watched this video and never noticed Anderson lying on the ground hahahahaha
Who is on 2025
anyone not only 2025 but also the end of the world?
I love these singers.  They are so funny and cool. I can't stop listening to this song.
Simp ahh😂😂
Tyler, what was you doin’…?
Seeing Bruno with a joint makes this song make sense even more 😭😭🕺🏽
😂the dying thing made me laugh 😂
Tengo una terraza tres campos de fútbol me siento y si me muero y berreo nadie me escucha smoking by the window
70s vibe
It’s hilarious when he says I wanna die then falls off camera and a solid minute later they cut back and he’s still on the floor lol
August 2025 anyone??
this whole album is too good

Bruno Mars,el único con el talento verdadero para ser llamado el heredero de Michael Jackson como rey del pop.
they would crush a church song
I adore Bruno...but he and Silk together are out of control😂 I was dying the 1st time I saw this.
Is Paak wearing the diamonds from her neck and wrist? And now he isn't alone?
Apparently, the street queens gave the song a hard pass.
This Dude Is Sexy As ❤Hell
Masterpiece,  they need to link with October London and take us
This band is for every decade 60's,70s, 80s etc
After 2 years, my divorce finally ended today. Kids stay with me but im paying for supports + 200k cash. “This bitch..got me paying for her trip..” part hits hard!
This song is cold 🥶🥶🥶🎛️🎤🎵🎶🥁
Apologize to say that  I like this music much much more than the great Beethoven play with many dozen experience people. .
Maravilha
Bom demais o Brasil te Amo
These muthafckas can sang !!!
All my life smoking by the window en la terraza en el monte en la montaña en la ciudad por la calle una me he preguntado por qué fumas y yo le pregunté por qué eres del Atleti nadie sabía por qué pero cada uno lo suyo
Cuidado americano Jack Sara Montiel cantaba aquello de fumando espero al hombre que yo quiero después de los cristales de unos segundos ventanales
Stunning

Love the song❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
BRASIL 2025❤✊🏿
Bruno Mars what an amazing singer
This song could've  really been great. The cursing just dumped  it in the trash for me. When I heard leave the door open I melted. Now open the door to throw this one out. Why do people  think that you have to use curse words for something to be good. It makes me grateful for the 60,70,80 old school slow jams. Real music,real music. Leave the curse words out. Leave them out . Open the door wide and leave them out.
Vocals are top notch as one would expect, but that drummer is on another level and smooth as can be. Bass player wasn't too shabby either 👍👍

Fantastic 🎉🎉🎉🎉
SOUL TRAIN!
Congrats on your album release Elliot! My fiance and I watched your premiere together <3 we're so happy to be here for your first and every milestone you reach
This is the best music video I've ever seen, and I'm 70 years old.  The singing, dancing, lyrics, comedy (Anderson Paak popping up saying, "This Bitch!" cracks me up every time I watch it, which is daily). The drummer is ace and the dancers punctuate his beats perfectly.  And, really, can Bruno Mars dance or what?  Perfection!
😊
😂😂😂😂😂 voltei más
Here 2025🎉
Damn !!!  The play!! To the city!! 😮 The wishes I have
Wow 😳😳
Se me eriza la piel con solo escucharlos. Cantan tan bonito 😍
Didn't know Adam Gomez sang. Dang.
Musica de verdad. Son un bálsamo. En medio de tanto regueton porquería.❤
Man, what would I give for a reaction of Jackson 5 to this🎉
Sonic felt down😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Best part is when Paak plays dead then hops up
😍😍😍
And i am the only tender ronnie loving birch,  shout out to bobby brown on that tender roney
Stop the victum mentality,  jesus will help you
Michel Jackson is Bad
Why did my ex just send this to me? 😂
Bruno can we please get music like this?

Sometimes I feel like rappers is the best liar in the world. I really wish pac still alive.

Boy George in the 80's, was the first person to allow me to realize it's okay to be my authentic self. He taught me to love all parts of myself and the ones I later discovered.
Goddamn this song is perfect
Awesome
This is how I feel getting rejected, can’t even get into dating phase. Must be something wrong with me.
Can anyone else smell that musty cigarette smoke though.. I stumbled on this and happen to be going thru an issue with my neighbor's nasty smoke seepin into my townhome~got me chokin, blowin up the air quality meter.. wish my neighbor was smokin out the window!😤

Nice hit. Thank you😊.

I think Bruno is better than whites and Asians latinos with his moves and swag
This girl he's talking about I know actually what u feeling
Is "I'm so cold, I'm so cold" a reference to that same lyric in the song Hot Tottie by Usher and Jay-Z? Seems obvious to me but I can't find anyone else who noticed this!

I love the melody and harmonies, the dance moves and overall 70's soul vibe, but I feel the profanity was unnecessary and kind of ruins an otherwise perfect song.

The amount of times I watched this video before i realized he *was dramatic, and died* and THEN CAME BACK. Iconic.
👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻I will never NOT love this song. When Anderson pops up off the floor😂😂😂every time❤️ I wondered if I could get my fiance to wear this for the wedding...🤔

This album restored my faith in the music industry
Back here in 2025 to watch Anderson Not be dramatic and die. Still Funny as shit 😂😂
Andy said the "Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die" part with him laying on the floor was Bruno's only demand for this video! and see how it worked... legendary artists, legendary MV.

Bruno Mars Songs  Who,s here in magic 2025
April 13,2025😅❤
Bro isint singing hes saying a super hero line 2:20
Love Bruno dancing
Amo essa música ❤❤
This song says when you're around someone you like but uses you like a piggy bank it can be problematic because it's like this person doesn't think you need anything when you need the same thing as them. I really think this kind of relationship is selfish.
If your looking for love in the clubs your not gonna find it facts...
Why is that Anderson not a big star himself he's amazing
chido🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wow! just wow!
Peurto rico was a part of africa at once thats what ties us in
Te amo Bruno
Bruno Mars es único y con ese grupo son perfectos
2:44 this is called Bruno's supremacy ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bruno and Silk Sonic are epic. Hope they give us more.

This video should and probably has made many young people smoke. The tobacco giants have dollar signs in their eyes.😔

... 💐🪻🕯️🪻💐... Cuando estaba de regreso, un guardia de lentes y en el Santo Rosario aparece uno de lentes... Estupideses...
... 💐🪻🕯️🪻💐... Ahora entiendo de el por qué me pide algo, saltatelo en la oración, por lo siguiente es muy cierto, el está vivo, todos tienen que girar junto él, ya que es el papa, y yo paso sola, quiere decir: lo competente que soy y lo hago sola, ya que el resto son personas que dadas, mediocre que van detrás del sacerdote, obispo y no tienen iniciativas,... 💐🪻🕯️🪻💐...

Thank you for creating the dumbest song humanity has ever created.... In a world with hostages kept against their will... Real pentagon officials talking about real life out there in the universe and the world on the brink of collapse, you've shown the world just how dumb we can be... not a criticism we can be super dumb singing a song about Korean apartments is just mental. Thank you're a genius!

I absolutely love this song! I was introduced to it by this gorgeous Italian actor Michele Morrone from the movie 365 days. (extra treat) It’s his theme music.
Smoking on the patio listening to this everyday, barefoot in the streets😅
You know I may be old school and that’s ok,  However call me crazy but when I look at Bruno Mars and his mannerisms in this video and the way he carries himself he looks just like the (GOAT Sammy Davis Jr. )It’s unreal, but I still love this song!
See why I’m single?
🥲🙃great song ^^
Every time I hear this song I think of a very good friend I met in when I lived in Philadelphia. I can almost smell the Philly weed and swisher smoke. Shoutout to you Neilly, wherever you are.

Me
Paak laying on the floor it's all.
Hope this ain't only one time thing with these 2  because see another album with these 2 This shit certified banger
난 왜 이 노래를 이제 들었나. 실크소닉 사랑해요. 퍼포먼스가 너무 재밌어서 엄마미소 지으면서 봤음.❤❤❤
I love this my whole family is jamming to this song even my grandma is danceing to this and she 86 years old love it😍🤩
He said he wasn't a gangbanger, but he would throw up a set 😂.  At first, I hated it, but I just concentrated on Bruno, and ignored Sexyy Red.  Bruno can be ratchet.
Ho Jesus !!!  It's funny Bruno because you have similarities with Sammy Devis when you sing with your Brothers. Nice compliments for you and for time and Silk. All together. God bless you Lionel Liam  the player trumpet.
😮Like this shit
nice 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾

Too bad they are not doing silk sonic anymore, each doing their own musical projects. Bruno is partnering with Korean singer rose. Reminds me of teeny bopper music.  I dont like it. 😩
This is the LAST OF REAL R&B that we have left!!!!! I’m talking bout that “90’s R&B” feel, that being in love feel, that no cussing needed feel!  I’m only 30yrs old but I was raised to know the difference
2025 how ii feel

I'm putting Bruno and his singers in the top tier with the Temps, Four Tops, the best harmony singers. Band is tight tight!
I'm a woman in her 60s and this is my new groove. Looove it. To hear men's angst so craftily interpreted. ❤
Bring back the funk with style.  Love it

Chuckee cheese, Hercules, Sigs. Love it😂🎉❤
never been heart broken like this but now i feel like i have 😢
When Anderson died, I died *MYSELF* after he fell to the ground and the camera panned back during Bruno’s amazing ass singing and I saw Anderson *STILL* laid out on that damn floor. 🤣🤣🤣   Then, when he popped his ass up from the ground to sing his part like nothing happened, I lost it so badly that I literally had to pause the video until I stopped laughing and caught my breath(which was no exaggeration around 2 minutes later🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️). 🤣🤣🤣   These dudes are some absolutely, positively, *God*-tier level, talented and hilarious *GENIUSES* !! Shit, it’s about to be the year 2025 in days and I’m still listening to this, along with their other masterfully amazing songs and I see no end in sight when it comes to whenever I will finally get tired of listening to them all. 🤷🏾‍♀️✊🏾💪🏾🔥🩵💯
👌👌

Anderson Paak "Don't want to be dramatic, but I wanna die." and proceeds to go full drama queen and lay on the damn floor. Had me cracking up.

You know, Bruno Mars is usually not my type of music..... but there's something about this song. I'll forget about it for a little while but something will remind me of it and then I won't be able to stop playing it on repeat for days at a time. It's crazy. There's just something about this song
Art of arts 🔥🔥🎉🎉

You just cant look away .Trully mesmerizing video.
The chemistry here is something most of today’s music just lacks these guys are hitting that 70s golden age of R&B soul with a sledgehammer and probably none of them were even born yet. Nice job  song to the video. To the arrangement, musicians, the vocalist, and the lyrics. this is a home run. I’m sorry I see these rap songs that are just blowing music out of the water towards making money and I don’t get it. This is music generated partial beats. Loops and samples I mean OK not everybody could put it together. I get it but then at the fact there’s nobody actually singing the God-given gift of a voice that can sing should be essential to music. Unless It’s friggin instrumental Just don’t know. I can feel it when I listen to rap. last  It’s just not warm. it’s not carrying the blood of sacrifice as a musician. You can’t compare picking loops and samples to somebody has mastered at the craft of an instrument. Not in 1 million years I don’t care what you say when you really listen to music or your musician yourself like I am feel it right away and I don’t wanna hear it. God bless them make money you can. My friends people are willing to pay take it, but I won’t call you an artist or musician, more like a storyteller set a beat a poet OK
she does sound good here...Brava...

If a time capsule would've been sent out of earth with the best example of what music of the 70's and 2000's was, this would be the best example. Any martian would be jiving and Vibing with this MOFO tune!

So smooth. This is great! Laughing my butt off. ❤❤❤❤
I love you Bruno Mars ❤❤❤
나 비흡연자인데 방금 한갑 피운 느낌이야
The perfect Pop/R&B song and performance.  Everything is on point from the arrangement, the harmonies, the intertwine of Bruno and Anderson's vocals, the falsetto, the choreography, set design, all the way to the classic Fender Bassman amp and tweed (no less) Fender Rhodes.    Love it!  Only thing missing was the crime scene tape outlining Anderson on the ground.
Ufff que hermosa canción gran dúo ❤ Pero Bruno te amo mi morenazo de dulce sonrisa. Buen baile ❤ la música a vuelto señores ❤🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥🔥
Music producer director song writer  Singer Dancer Plays drum Plays tambourine  Play guitar  Play base    What did i miss? ... If only he was black, he'd be celebrated as the most talented singer in history,too bad he was born in wrong race

Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (ooh, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody), ooh
Pimpin bruno is the best bruno mars version 🤙🏻
Ngl this has to be the smoothest "gold-digger situation" song out there...             Ngl, I'm at the same point. But at the same time carving my board on the street while listening to this
Legend says he is still smoking out the window

November 2024?
猫と海に行き、海の掃除を猫としました。この曲を流し良い思い出になりましたが、亡くなりました。ブランドの猫ではない捨て猫です。私には大切な家族でした。何者かが猫を刺しました。皆さんがもしペットを買っているとしたら、許せますか？海外の人も平気ですか？

Compare Bruno in Silk Sonic to 24K Magic 🥲
o tanto que eu amo essa música, não ta escrito
I always wondered how they sang so good while smoking at the same time😮
Bruno Mars, você é muito simpático, nós, mineiros de BH amamos você,thank you 👏👏❤️
"not to be dramatic" *lays flat on the floor* 😂😂😂
🚬 so funny ! ❤
About the girl I seen in California
that smoking out the window was Heavenly
When te enamoras de una cariñosa y se te ocurre un temazo:
“This is a relaxing song!”. 1:51 Anderson: *jump-scares me in the music video*
Song writers secret... the ones in the know KNOWS he is not talking about a woman. Or a man or child because folks are so sleep I dare not say.
November 2024
Nov5 2024? 😍❤
Hearing him cheerfully singing "don't wanna be dramatic but I wanna die" was amazing

These guys are so hilarious 😂😂I love it🎉❤ I'll never get enough of Silk Sonic💯✨
November 2024....
November 4 who !
1:36
NO ONE COMES CLOSE! PERIOD
If y'all notice.. this is perfect for Doja Cat's "Ain't Shit"
So gold he combined the head over heels feeling for the girl and his frustration at the same time calling her a bitch. Hahahha!!! Reminds me of the song by Parokya ni Edgar, in the singer's head he's cursing the girl YSOAB but what was uttered by his mouth was "Bahala ka basta mag ingat ka."
1:52 jump scare

First time I heard this song, I felt so much empathy for Twitch Chat.
I told my son (13 years) to get back to me on this when he gets older! Putting him on to great music.
November 2024?
What is the name of the song used for the edit?
Yes, right after listening to ima leave the door open. But asking, out of curiosity. This feels like part broken heart but satirical on men too. AmIWrong?
November 2024?
This music timeless.

Gratidão a Deus Pó telo aqui no Brasil Coisa linda que prazer  Teló aqui seja sempre muito bem vindo
Tenho tido dias árduo  Ah alguns sonhos  Que desejo muito pôde um dia realizar ,1° uma casa onde terei paz  Com minhas duas filhas e minha neta 2° meu tratamento dentário E saúde 3° Bruno Mars  E pôde ajudar minha irmã  Que se encontra acamada e com dor sei que parece impossível Este grande sonho mas sou muito confiante em Deus ,mesmo sabendo Que não será fácil  Um dia terei este imenso prazer De participar do show do Bruno Mars eu amo a simplicidade a carisma a meiguice a alegria  a qual ele mesmo sem saber consegue me proporcionar mesmo que pó vídeo ou aparição em vídeo reportagem  Nossa este rapaz e muito especial Talvez nem ele mesmo tenha admissão do quanto e amado querido justo eu que nunca fui tiet  De nem um cantor me declaro sou sup fã de Bruno Mars  Que Deus abençoe ele e toda sua banda e equipe ❤
Pet sculpted vs polluted specimen is pls enumerate the cost  Vìs-à-vìs the witch common sense you lack
Eu me apaixonei por Bruno Mars  Lamentável pó duas vezes  Não consegui ir ao show dele ,  Mas ouço todos os dias  Com muito prazer e satisfação

You look desperate Bro Move on and have some pride cuz this is crazy dude . Lose weight for you not for her Bro… You look  Desperate Bro and for what ? Smh
This is my kind of music plus steping to the beat. You fellows done did the do. Thanks

Garcia Gary Johnson Mark Hernandez Paul
Yes  thank u Anthony  Hamilton I love it
Love me my Bruno
Era muito bom!! Depois que se juntou com esse Paak aí virou uma baixaria só!! 😢 Lamentável!!
Does anyone know which music executives he is hinting towards? I see three main people he’s emphasizing in this video and I wonder who they are. We should put them on blast in the spotlight. I am so sick of hearing all this evil happening right under our noses in light of the Diddy trial. We all need to raise hell for our children and for the sake of our society.
A whole vibe truly!!
Bruno The Best,I Love you❤
Bruno The Best,❤❤❤❤❤
Anderson Paak is talented af

Absolutely a masterpiece of R&B style. A timeless music. A timeless musicians. I think that, like the actually days we hear MJ, Marvin, Elvis, and other epic artists, in the future, people will listen this album and thinking "How I wish I had seen one of their shows". I'm so glad to live at the same time Silk Sonic <3

This song is a such a vibe. I can see me and my friends dancing to this in the 90s lol
No matter how many times you listen to it, it's just as good as ever.
😉😆Isaiah 9:16. Those who guide➡ these people are the same ones who misguide them,😵💫😳 and those who are guided allow themselves to be seduced and led into error.☹😮 By whom are you guided? By your sinful desires, by greed for wrong things? Do you allow yourself to be seduced by fame, money,💰💰 by the glory of this world?🌎🌏 Jesus is returning every day for millions of people, one day your time will come. If your life is like this, he will not be able to take you to Heaven; instead, evil spirits will take you to suffering from which you will never be able to escape.😰😫😭Come to Jesus, read the Bible.
HOW TF DID I JUST LEARN ABOUT THIS SONG??? 🤣🤣
SHE WRONG
Wasn’t what I wanted or expected when I heard these 2 had a song together. I don’t even like the song and have to say it’s really really good.

Omg ima akmost graduate
Remmeber me at chuck e cheese this day kater in the day listening to the album2:2230 while there and shopping
Leave The Door Open se llevo los Grammy, pero esta canción me fascina mucho más! El álbum entero es una joya, pero esta tiene algo especial. Los videos, sean preparados o en vivo son una delicia visual. Me encanta cómo logran ese equilibrio entre el soul y el funk, respetando las raíces pero dándole su toque único. Retro con un toque moderno. Me dan ganas de bailar  y cantar pero se me pasa...
Sheesh! almost forgot how epic this tune still is in 2024 🎉
I think Bruno is male artist #1 nowadays ♥ Full on entertainer
I love the parts where Anderson Paak pops up on the screen to sing 😂
this video is iconic
This is the kind of lounge performance only good money could buy.
Old school showroom show! Smoking on stage like the rat pack👍👍👍🥳🥳🥳love it!😂

Their singing is singularly soulful, spellbinding, superb, sincere, sweet and simply spectacular. ❤❤❤❤❤❤

Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic - Smokin Out The Window [Official Music Video] PEGA LADRÕES
Lyrics:  Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)

BRUNO MARS ARE OBVIOUSLY A GENIUS
The story of Han Jo kim and Regina Turner (Real Story)  Mr. Han is a spine surgeon and he makes millions per year and eventually he married Regina Turner, a pageant queen. Unfortunately Mr. Han doesn't know that Regina is a High end sex worker and in 5 years of their relationship Regina is still working as a high end sex worker and it basically means that she is cheating from his wife, not just once but many times. Eventually, Mr. Han finds out and he divorces Regina... End of the story*  There are rumors that Mr. Han is smoking out the window...
I'm crying and laughing😢❤❤
,,

I WILL NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS ALBUM
Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars Is The Quintessential Pairing Of 2 Gifted Talents Performing Together.  Their Voices Has Their Own Unique Tone and Sounds Where Anderson’s Is A Raspy Pitch and Bruno’s Is More Clear and Pure.  Hasn’t Been a More Perfect Dup Combination Of 2 Singers Since Hall & Oates.
😍😍😍
This song is already 2 years old life gettin old
bro at 1:18 when they do that foot stomp, it reminded me of the Karma dance. Jojo really copied everything from her song to her choreography
Muito bom
Love this 😍
This is great!
2:02 why bro respawned like that 😂
Not this man legit laying in the crime scene body position 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
This my 1st time seeing the video 😂😂😂 I just love bro was like not to be dramatic but I wanna die, then the camera turned and went back Gee was face down on the floor for a minute, but he had a strong pop up😂😂😂

July 2024?
I think a horror movie is coming soon to a screen near us ❤
Hello, 2030 folks from 2024 👋.
Slick and gorgeous clip, but my 21 year old daughter just got murdered by a jealous boyfriend. We will never, ever, ever recover. This tone to women is deadly.
the instruments + voices = life vibes (Heaven)
1:36

1:38 someone call the ambulance
"Not to be dramatic but I wanna die"...  proceeds to die die fr 💀💀

This song remembers me the 2010s era when Bruno Mars was solo, for real good times 🫶🏻😭🕺🏻
POV 1:45 is when you "rehearsing" this song with your cousins and your mum walks in😂😂😂😂
Anyone here on 2030?
is it not weird that songs about owning people still come out? I swear to god people are like "Man I want good things for everyone," but then also they're like ,"Oh man that's my jam."
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

última música que escutei com minha ex, bem na época que lançou. A música rolando e eu só prestando atenção nos olhos dela...
my ex and i loved this song. until i realized what this bitch was doing to me.
I love how this sounds like a rly nice song until U listen to the lyrics
This is so fucking good how am I just now finding it
I’m just watching in disbelief how they can say things and do things on time before saying their line 😂 such amazing directing
1:19 first time I seen this part I got tingles 😂 felt so magical
i dedicate this song to my landlord
I had no idea that there was two different ppl till today.  I thought bruno did this sung by himself
This video absolutely killed me. I mean, tears running down my face, wheezing, silent laugh/crying, ribs-about-to-crack dying laughter. A goddamn treasure 🤣🤣🤣🤣
LOVELY
Anderson hitting the GTA San Andreas death pose
Is that Bruno mars bother on drums 🤤🤤
I'm happy to be alive to ever come across such music
I am from India❤
Not when Anderson was still on the floor during the chorus😂😂😂😂
❤😂🎉😢😢😅😊❤😢😂😢😂😅😊😢😂😢😮🎉😅❤😮😂😅🎉😅😅😅❤❤❤
0:32 was unexpected 😂
Bruno really went from "you can count on me" to "count on yourself b*tch"
This tickled me 🤣
hahahahah I now see Jelloo  😆

0:32 1:43 Dis B Meme
Always loving the 1960’s dance moves
😁👍
Anyone in 2025
ok this video is Broken...
Classic 🔥🔥🔥🔥
*1:43** Bruno kept singing like dude does this sh all the time in rehearsal.*
I think bruno is enjoying his career
Bruno really made LeBron sing and dance behind him
Como não gostar das suas músicas
Bruno is what happens when a good man gets his heart broken lmao “this bitch” that’s how we all feel at least once a week with our ladies
Finally a song I can vibe with my dad
This makes me feel like I’m in the 2000’s again honestly
I love you 💕
OMG Bruno Mars how i wish to be in your concert 💕
Am I the only one who laughs out loud while enjoying the melody 😀❤❤
they tried but they couldnt get those juicy lens flares you see on old disco videos.
Aaaaaaaaand they peaked with this $h1t.
Now we know LBJ good at chorus!
Bruno Mars is my favorite modern pop artist for a reason: showmanship. His showmanship is unmatched in the modern era. Dude fucking slays it.
Браво 👏!!!!!!!
That's is a child support song
Seeeeeeeeeeensacional!!!!
Here from a meme video where Anderson says "this bxtch" and then just lays on the floor lmao. I already knew this song beforehand though I just didnt know the name so yay!
Smoke kin out
This is fire
How can these dudes be so nerdy and so smooth at the same time?
1:43 Anderson Paak 😂😂😂😂😂 I'm ☠
Beautiful bro❤
The choreo though. So smooth.
The immediate transition from "Disbelief" to "Dis bitch" is a great juxtaposition of words!
Just discovered this song an hour ago, and I am OBSESSED!
Ma Yolo
It's kinda messed up that P. Morris didn't get a production credit for this video. Their influence carries the visuals in a way we haven't seen in quite a while....
The national anthem of "she belongs to the streets".
Smoooooth 🎶☺
Hi-five to the Jackson 5. It’s good to see your routine again. 🖐🏾
Y I'm jus realizing Anderson. Paak was still laying on the floor after he said he wanna die way after the fact 😭
New Orleans 2002, 21 years old me just hearing this for the time driving to Hammond L.A. with my 37 year old ole lady from plaqmines Parish.  Much love to you always Peggy ❤️
Smoking out the window like a weirdo all I need is you and I can stop what I do if I can't have music I don't want to I got to keep it gangsta
He got me smoking like a weirdo
Omg just heard this song for the first time and I laughed my ass off! I thought it was a joke at first but I didn't know it was FOR real.😅😂 Soo FUNNY!
still listening .... still brilliant.
So great - so funny - so many harmonies. You guys are groundbreaking 🙏
"bitch"  **dies**
Lmao when this song dropped I thought “I can never relate” and yet here I am. This bitch
I was today years old when I watched a Bruno Mars video 5 times and laughed my ass off everytime like it was the first.
Just found this song from a meme lol Glad I did
0:32 Best New Meme
Bring back men's heartbreak songs.
Anderson actually fucking died bro…
OMG 😳 I ❤IT! Too 😎 & Smooth! I can’t believe I just learned this Song today April 30th 2024🎉🎉❤fire
1:34 Anderson proving smoking is deadly 1:51 just kidding
This video is so unintentionally funny 😂
Pretty voices!
Oh my God you’re such a good singer can you ping mean like this you are a decent and really talented singer❤️💖
these dudes just make videos admitting to how they pay money for pussy and everyone is like "This is modern music."  These are musical confessions.
Beautiful nice looking men's and sing so beautiful!!!

Far cry from leaving the door open.
I do not listen to this type of music usually, but this was very entertaining and had comedy moments. Also, I like the oldies vibe.
Io mi sento sposata con Anderson Paak

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아 우껴
FIRE THATS IS FIRE I LIKE THAT BRUN MARS
Grotesque!  Mars better get himself a better manager, and drop his sexist BS songs, or more than me will continue to cringe when we come across his videos.  Such wasted talent when he and his choices turn to cheap woman-hating to prove some kind of bitter male chauvinist crap.  Disgusting pandering to music biz, losing love, and beauty, is a hard loss to listen to again and again by Mars.  This one leaves NO doubt to his selling out.  What a waste.  What dark versions of womankind is celebrated in this hateful ditty.
Only thing this song could have used was the mucus fading out. THAT WOYLD HAVE BEEN HOT! STILL IN LIVE WITH IT THOUGH. ❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks Anderson and Bruno for keeping Soul Soul, I can't stop listening to this! I'm in love with this SONG! 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲, REMINDS ME OF THE MUSIC I GREW UP IN!
0:32  and 1:44 - my favorite parts of the song

I almost died when he hit the floor 😂😂😂😂
WOW

GALAXY 🧐 Gangsta
THIS WILL NEVER GET OLD 💪💪💪🌛✨✨
I am a 55 year old fan because of the Benny Johnson  show. She reminds me of neo soul sound. I almost gave up on music being elevated.
Old school comeback..with a little now.
Relaxing tonight with myso ng
Every time I watch this and see Anderson in a "deed" state, I crack up laughing!
Desculpa dizer, mas Bruno Mars tem o molho.
I hope they collaborate again with 70's Soul.
The way i didn't realize he was laying on the fllloooorrrre!!!💀💀💀 Then he popped back in on his part😂😂😂😂😂😂
I thought that was Jamie Foxx😂😂
Fo-shizzle
❤❤❤❤

This ought to be the anthem for all simps.
Love them together. 😍
1:33 me at the slightest inconvenience:
This is the damn song 😮
❤❤❤
This is what's left of original R&B 🎶 music, love ballads that made sense and made you love 😍 and fall in love ❤, Bruno is boricua 🇵🇷💥and Filipino that is doing right by our urban music 🎶, culture and style that must be preserved.  Maxwell 🇵🇷and Bruno 🇵🇷are the only ones left. I'm 61 and my love for this music n genre must continue 🎉!!!
Bro chill. Just enjoy the fucking song bro ya'll yelling in comment section about Anderson pak 😂😂
How Bruno didn’t bust out laughing 😂
🥰
Still love the music and this video. ❤
Greatest concert I’ve been to. Life changing.
KUDZAI EMMA Matea Anahi Jayden

🖤💯🖤
Burno mars me la pelas
Not “Barefoot in these street” 😂😂
Beautiful
This is the best hurt dude anthem😂I shouldn’t love this song this much, it’s pure genius
this is exactly how i feel at the moment
They can put Bruno in front all they want, he still looks short as hell
Not to be dramatic but  being this attracted has me in my feels😩
...and the cigar in their hands...so funny...
The fact that he played dead and got up with that same cigarette is critical🤣🤣
복고풍의올드한음악제스쳐를세련되고감미로움으로변신시키는브루노볼때마다그의매력에매료되네❤❤❤😊😊
I’m listen to this every morning ❤
POV: its 1961 and you're a time traveler, managed to sneak into WLTW - 106.7 Lite FM station just to play this music.  also people would probably ask "WTH is UFC?"
Should of been "she belong.          To the STREETS"
I wish Bruno Mars would ft the weeknd I love them both equally  Gonna be a mad duo
Good Music!1st time hearing the song
Hahahaha this song basically is "Nobody likes me but everyone likes you and I'm mad about that," but these dudes FOUND EACH OTHER.  I am NOT EVEN mentioning the ironic theme here.
Imagine a female version of this song, now that would be dramatic 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love that smoking thing!
This sounds too good!!
Mltm
No $$$ This si mi
I love this song
Anderson!!!!!!! Bruno!!!! Brilliant!
DANG but  at the end brono mars got some good vocalizing
we need a new album NOW
Funniest part of this whole video is when my guy pops saying "This bitch " tell me that part isn't funny to you??
How could Anderson paak do what he did to his ex-wife, so sad
Ac dc
This music video takes me out every time 😂
This ngga Bruno be singing man

Went from "That's what I like" to "That's what I hate"
I listen to so much music. Anything from Bobby Brown to Boyz II Men, Bell Biv Devoe to Immortal Technique, Meshuggah to Infant Annihilator, this song has been 90% of my playlist this week. So much potential in Silk Sonic
超最高に魅力的でキラキラピカピカですね☆

When did Bruno Mars become dark skin?

Aqui no Brasil temos um presidente ladrão que ficou preso por anos.
Literally the perfect pair. The video and the song is a-1.
Damn already two years time flies
The sass in this video is unreal and unmatched 👏🏽👏🏽😅😅
“i hope you find whatever it is that you need, but i also hope that your trifling ass is walking around barefoot in these streets.” might be one of my favorite breakup lines ever lol
I looove this video ❤
lol this is the first time i have seen this,   I like it    ;-)     makes me think of a couple of women i have  known
Massive O'Jays vibes. Love it

It's the cigarettes that got me! They went retro and ain't even trying to vape cause they want that authenticity!
Real life is a 2003 chapelle show skit
Bruno was feeling himself when Anderson decided to be dramatic on the floor 😂
this is just perfect in every single way
I LOVE IT......😅
SMOKING OUT THE WINDOW, HELL I NEED ONE
1:41 "Diamonds on her neck! Diamonds on her wrists! "
Ain't NOBODY smoother than Bruno Mars!!! 💜
What gender it's this type of song?
Gotta be one of the funniest MVs recently.
0:32 LOL  Waiting for this to be a meme.
Love there tunes warning to good brothers and good women keep away from this no good modern guys & women just fxxking gold diggers!!
Man!!  Gotta give this man a high five for making music worth listening too!
Absolutely perfect.
how did he make the THIS BITCH so majestic?
Bruno went to ill take a bullet for you*to  take that thing for yo self
anderson .paak. on the floor done near killed me 🤣
This is one of the absolute few to hit that "Imma watch this on repeat... multiple times" list.
I feel like all of the people in this song are the bad people, but they're also INCREDIBLY talented.
You can't turn a garden tool into a housewife.
❤👍👍👍
These gentlemen are so cool.   Like years past. Gotta go for now.    The doors open.
Love this absolutely brilliant 😊😊😊
Bruno good
Hiii  @BrunoMars   Do you know ABRAHAM MATEO?  https://youtu.be/WFMFiK_ubxE?si=Keajbeei7QmEiiQj  He is so talented, loves music since he was a kid  And today, he is an international artist  He loves your music  Please, Give him a chance of duet  I'm sure you won't regret  Thank You
Close your eyes and you might think this was The Temptations. Anderson is David Ruffin.
I Don't like this part of Bruno Mars. Hence no Awards............
0:51 melhor parte arrepiei
He's chanelled every 70's-80's vibe and it's awesome. Makes you feel like a kid again  Thank you for this, both of you
Can we appreciate the fact they did all that while holding 🚬
Miss you Bruninho, come back to Brazil!
Homie went from catching her shots to throwing them shots back
This group nasty with the jams
I love the kick of any Bruno Mars song! Can anyone else relate?

브루노의심장을녹이는보이스와매력넘치는제스처는그냥내눈과귀를홀리는구나💕💕

This sounds sooooo cool!!!! Omg
2024. Classic.
every time I hear these, I want to mention James Jamerson, legendary Motown bass player who was a beautiful player who died a miserable death........young uns, please look him up and post about him
I love these guys but fuck smoking - it tells you and shows you what cancer will do to you on the packets. Great song though
Bro I'm laughing so hard at 0:30
룩삼 bring me here
'Gotta give you back to the city'  got me wheezing 😂😂😂
He grippin that cigarette like he grippin his last nerve
HOLY FUCK WOW!!  Musical perfection!
When he said diamonds on her wrist, I honestly thought he was gonna say diamonds on her, t!ts
I love how this song musically is just top tier, but they really almost treated the lyrics and clip like some parody😂 it’s genius
Gotta give That Girl HER Props💯. She damn sure ain't broke  $$💯💯
She belong to the streets
I was driving and heard this…stepped on it to see the Video home 😊 AMAzing ❤
Starting 2024 with my love
HI DUO IRMÃO 🫂 LETS GO 🅰️🆖📧 L U ÉDY ENTENDI
This was genius. It’s modern music that everyone could enjoy. From our parents to grandparents.
Ya'll.  Just.  Make ...cigarettes cool again... ...Nice it!
really made a song for a sugar daddy lol
Bruno's "b*itch" sounds a little too personal 1:37 😂
😂😂
Sóle sólè in the back tho lol lesssko 👍👍
Anderson is the best part of this video omg😂😂😂
Who slept on this song?
Because of these guys, I would like to dress up like a pimp 24/7.
Essa música é como um vinho 🍷. Quanto mais velha fica melhor fica o sabor
Música maravilhosa bate um ritmo na alma 💖
Comcast is terrible. I called cust service. I wanted to changed my phone#. They asked me for my email address. They only ask for an email address or some device#. I said i dont know those. Theres a lottttt of comcast customers in the country but they only ask for my email. They put me on hold.  Also at the same time im logged in on the website but it doesnt work. They wasted an hr of my time
2024 here❤
Need these two to put a something more out😂
I love 💕 these guys
All they needed was Ike Turner in the back on the base with his perm shaking
Best song of the 20s man
This is hilarious….
Fábio Eu quero casar com a Linda cidade meu novo Amor!
Anderson said with his teeth " Dis Bitch, got me paying her rent, paying for chips, diamonds on her wrist" 😂😂😂😂
Came back to watch in 2024 omg Paak Still leave me DEEEAADDD 😭😭🤣🤣😂🤣.
Trilha sonora da RED PILL ... 😂
THEY KILLED THIS SONG!!! BRUNO IS A BEAST!!!💯🔥 The "running around my crib like its Chuck E. Cheese" line had me weak AF😂🤣🤣, I'm sold!!!
🇧🇷?
I’m 73 and about lost my mind the first time I heard this. Now their music is on all of my playlists. Even went out and bought two CD’s to wear out in my “old school” CD player.😂😂😂
Love the 70's vibe that this gives me.
Who are the other two guys dancing?  They're just as awesome as Bruno and Anderson!
Anderson! Who broke your heart😅?! Chin up, chin up😅
Pov: ur an artist and ur looking for the sweetest way to say she a ho😂😂
something about bruno mars and making music just makes the world go round. every. single. song. never flops
Gostei não conhecia  amei a batida 😊
This is legit. Vintage but modern. Nothing compares.  Creates a real picture while giving out good vibes. Bravo! And more to come please.
เพลงดีมาก
Know they lit love this song
These guys are having the time of their lives and we are lucky to be here for it.
❤❤❤❤❤love it
The girl they're singing about is the same one getting spoiled in That's What I Like
2024 anyone????.
I just ran across this jam yesterday by accident. I'm 66 and from the old school days of music that sounded like this back in the 70's & 80's. You guys remind me of the smooth male vocalist sounds of The Delfonics, The Dramatics, Blue Magic and of course the Stylistics and so many more. Damn this sounds good not to mention the choreography!
Que coisa maravilhosa
Anderson Paak laying on the floor still got me laughing 😂 😂 good funny song & video
This record right here? Brings me to the past and future at the same time. Incredible. A masterpiece. The mixing, production, and vocals talents of the gentleman is 2nd to none. Thanks for giving us the true Future Retro.
2024...They Did THAT!
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

"She belong to everybody" 😂😂
Silk sonic is by far the coolest " new " music out there, hands down. Great vibe. Reminds me of the classics with a twist
starting at 2:45 Bruno gives off some serious Marvin Gaye vibes
Still enjoying this in 2024
"Not to be dramatic but i wanna die *falls to floor*" Still laughing 2 years later
One of the best artist and entertainers that I have the pleasure of  watching and listening to.

Bruno Mars The Michael Jordan of modern soul singer
Bruno in my opinion is the best musician ❤ he deserves more respect 🫡 ❤❤❤❤
Me and Anderson have the same birthday!!

1:37 why does he say bitch so aggressively😭😭😭
This is definitely Joe Smith right now
What's this supposed to be the Slow Jam version of Gold Digger?
When Bruno hits his knees I swoon.
Ok
The way Anderson fell on the ground will never not be hilarious to me 😭
The way Anderson fell on the ground will never not be hilarious to me 😭
Paak's' "This Bitch" was too personal 😂

Bruno Mars is one of those few artists that you can tell is truly a student of music and makes quality records. He could have his own DECADES tour.
Love how in sync they are with their dance moves
normal version = classic chill  1.25x has more beat, pretty cool
기러기 아버지들을 위해 이 노래를 밀양박씨 최고 아웃풋 앤더슨이 바칩니다
I want to see Anderson.Paak perform a retro Johnny B. Good on Lessons in Chemistry...or at least a music video.

as someone who listens to mainly heavy music, I absolutely love Bruno Mars
❤
When Bruno's chorus came up and he hit the B in "bitch" there was FEELIN behind that. that man was speaking from the soul.
It’s almost 2024 now. This is still the best music video I’ve ever seen
😂 I'm I the only one who finds this song hilarious 😂
I can't believe I've just discovered this song now.  I could've been bumping this long time ago.  Smooth.
Gamblino you are the Master right in the same category as Marvin Gaye- Timeless Melancholy and Stress Relieving at the same time❤
Jackson 5.. never can say goodbye
I love your  song  so much ❤❤❤❤ it’s so good your  songs are so amazing
Just came across this and omg.... I am loving it!  The choreography is outstanding, the lyrics are hysterically funny; the whole vibe is like nostalgic and sexy at the same time!.
Somebody told me hes singing about the same chick he caught a grenade for 😂😂😂
Damn, I salute a short king with a voice like that…
70s Vibes Indeed!
Cool
I can't decide what's funnier: Paak just lying on the ground after the "not to be dramatic, but I wanna die" line, or the way he just pops back up in the chorus 🤣
2 DAMN YEARS!!! I NEED MORE JAMS BRUNO🫶🏽🫶🏽
You were Wrong Baby*
Newton*:-)
How you doing*
She belongs to Everybody*
I tried to tell you*
Anderson dying and coming back to life mid song gets me everytime 😂
Идеальная картинка и саунд, расслаблено и на чиле, вместе с тем с изрядной долей юмора. И как этот шедевр прошел мимо меня, ума не приложу!
This is my smoking weed song🌳🔥😙💨
As atuações nessa música são tudo 🤣
nice
Bruninho ❤
Me llegó este tema a la mente.

Took me awhile to warm to Bruno, but his recent trips down delfonics lane has got me hooked. This song is 💯💥🔥🔥🕺🏿🕺🏿
The way he's passed out on the floor. 😂
Okay, they've been watching old clips of the 1950s lounge singers. 😂😂
My mom loves this album it makes me smile to see her groove to it
Best Video ever!!
BM is a genius
Make music 🎶 Great Again 🙏🏾🥰🫶🏽❤️❤️
I still listen to this like it’s brand new but I’m hoping something new is coming soon from them together again
Qqqqqq2l❤
This video deserves even more views 💯
He is up there with MOTWON. Not close like most of these groups. In the same class as MOTOWN
1:41  Never ceases to make me laugh. Dude is laid out.
Essa é a minha preferida desse álbum maravilhoso!!! (This is my favorite from this wonderful album!!!)🥰
Paak being dead on the floor for a good 15 seconds is so funny
salve
1:44 when Anderson is just lying on the floor just got me dear
Como me deixa triste uma música como essa, um álbum como esse ser tão pouco comentado, Bruno Mars veio ao the town e as pessoas ficaram maravilhadas como se nunca tivesse visto uma performance dele ao vivo
Totally 70s vibe! So great to see someone respecting that style😊
They all sound alike ❤
This music is a breath of fresh air! Old head 4 life!
Deserves every 'like'...
When he was passed out on the floor 😂😂😂😂

Lyrics:  Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (that girl there, she belong to everybody), ooh Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass Is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out! Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (ooh, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody), ooh

Anderson throwing himself on the ground is hilarious, and Bruno pretending he didn't see it, acting naturally, is perfect.  This partnership is very successful.  The 2 complement each other, and the album is excellent.  Let the second come!
I love this song Bruno mars is my favorite singer in the wold❤

Estou presa nessa paixão, amo Bruno Mars,  e seu som , nessa vibe anos 70 . Maravilhosos ❤❤
Carrying this generation
O Anderson no chão me quebrou kkkk
Why is Bruno Mars name the only one as the featured artist when it should say Silk sonic or Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak. And why are some people in the comments talking as if Anderson Paak isn’t in the song?
A ERA SILK SONIC FOOOI TUDOOOO PRA MIMMMM! 🥰 Que Álbum SIMPLESMENTE IMPECÁVEL
Wonderful ❤❤❤❤
Anderson does a real slick Bobby Womack move.. ❤😮
Damn this is awesome.
Imagine it’s winter, snowing outside you’re sipping on a warm cup of hot chocolate and watching this video  Pure bliss🎉
só tem homem bonito nessa porra é
I love this song, it’s so smooth.  Yet I find myself cracking up every time they say, “This b—-h!”.  The video is funny too, the way he keeps popping up out of nowhere into the camera frame.😂😂
My lord the video for this song is so silly 😂 they’re so unserious and I love it so much!
Bro I accidentally put this in my Slaps playlist and I don't have to take it out 🔥
Coming from a 57-year old lady these boys are hot
You know I don't know if you would consider Bruno in my generation probably not but I still feel very lucky to be able to have been able to hear him and listen to him while I was still alive
This is what music should sound like!!
I would like to dedicate this song to my female tuxedo cat.
Cultural appropriation.  This dude is 0% black
Bruno didn't have to go so hard with this....bitch....I felt all that 😂😂😂
É UMA ENERGIA MUITO BOA QUE ESTE BRUNO MARS TRÁS NAS MUSICAS DELE  !!!
Sing Bruno sing
Mkay.. I got a wonderful woman. . Everytime I hear you sing this song you make me fall for you more and more, mamas!
1:44 Andy no chão, o grito que eu dei HAHHAHAAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHH

esses dois juntos foi a melhor coisa na história da música que aconteceu, amooo você Bruninhoooo
❤❤❤
I don’t think I’ve ever seen Anderson paak standing up 😮😅
Bruno and Pak is like Penut butter and jelly. Not the duo we deserve but the one we needed.
.          .    . .  . ....,    mm mmm. Mnn .👏
Bruno!!
This is bizarre, i mean they are great singers and the style is really well done but its like an ad for cigarettes. It certainly doesn't fit with modern trends and awareness of the cancer causing habit.
São incríveis juntos
3:01 3:03 this is for what I only come here back to back❤
Bruno e Anderson combinaram muito.. eu amo
Vibe boa e essa❤❤❤❤❤
The crown 😤. 😊.

I AM NOT A Bruno Mars Fan!  I came upon this track after listening to Kelly Rowland's "Kisses Down Low". The Algorithm--You Know?  The Only Dynamic of this 70's R&B "Attempt" missing Is:  The Footwork🦶🏿  The Temptations, OJays, Smokey Robinson And The Miracles, The Delfonics, Blue Magic, The Spinners. You get The Picture!  If Ya'll gonna do the Thang Do Tha Damn Thang 🎵🎼🎶
I love this collaboration
When I see you guys performing like this. Reminds me of Morris day and the times.
LET THEM COOK 🍳 🔥 🔥
They are perfect together.
Bruno Mars....You should redo the Raydio song Jack and Jill!!!
This song an video would of been perfect for Michael Jackson and Prince!!!!!!!!!
Anderson Paak is so funny 🤣

I love this song so much I love Bruno Mars so much he's been my favorite artist ever since I was 4 years old And I'm wishing one day I can go to one of his concerts ❤ :)
Bruno mars is singing about doja cat
This was a moment. They were in their hilarious bag.
When he said “this bitch” I felt that.
Damn i needs friends, serves you right.
This song is lap dance ecstasy
Gives me flashbacks...good ones.
os brasileiros estão em todos os lugares, te amamos Bruninho ❤️
eu passaria um dia inteiro ouvindo essa musica, sem nenhuma dificuldade !
The think is I am 65 years old. I respect and, love the fact that these young men get old school R&B. They have my heart forever.
Black & Brown Love ❤️
Te amo Bruninho❤🇦🇴
1:36
Its the way bruno snaps like an old cat when he says this bitch and the chuck e. Cheese parts for me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
STOP. THE. AUTOTUNE. FAACK!!!!!
A única coisa terrível é o péssimo exemplo dos fumantes 😢😢😢
Muito vibe Jackson s Five....❤
Bruno Mars is just brilliant
This is just smooth as f***** what a genius!!!!
BRUNO MARS, ERES INCREÍBLE...SIEMPRE TE SUPERAS A TÍ MISMO EN CADA CANCIÓN. PRECIOSO!!!  #BrunoMars
Dude... Anderson on the floor... I CRACKED!!
"Gotta give ya back to the city." D😮MN!
Qué canción tan hermosa ❤️
This album was fire 🔥 and the live concert was 100% better!! They’re concert is the best concert I’ve ever been to ❤️🙌🏾
no cap
this is🔥🔥🔥🔥
Does really nobody know that he's talking about Dojo cat like nobody's talking about this and those two were together look so you know when she said and that ain't s*** song she said can't pay rent go check at the ancient song you'll know then that they were together because this was made one year after Dojo Cat made that so I hope this was helpful and please like if you don't know if you didn't know that doJo cat and Bruno Mars was together
Porque fomentan fumar como si fuera cool, es dañino para el ser humano uds no me lo esperaba, son ídolos de niños adolecentes, por último promuevan el deporte

Am I the only one who thinks they referenced the Temptations and how they would dance in sync while the lead was on the side ? If so that is Genius !!
Thank GOD for these fellas with bringing the smooth sounds +and styles) of 70s R&B!! Todays music is HORRIBLE!!!

WOW😢😮 Are we still on earth?!
I'm a 70's lady this music 🎶 has that grit just like back in the day.won me over for sure. It's 2023 ❤ ❤ ❤ Master piece ❤❤
I have not seen Group Stepping this good since the 60s and 70s. Love this Video and Song reminds me of Old School.
We need Bruno Mars back please 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
My very first time hearing this song, and it was my mother who told me about it a few minutes ago. Lol. Thanks mom, I do like the song. 😅
This song is cool and extremely well-crafted, but it also vividly depicts an inner-movie scene that resonates with the listener on a variety of levels and feels real and authentic. The simple fact that so few people today are actually capable of singing a song like this demonstrates mastery. You could count them on one hand. Not only Bruno and Anderson are excellent, but the entire group is as well! A winning attitude is added to the mix by the hip dancing moves and the music, which is smooth and direct at the same time. Bravo!
❤❤❤❤
0:32
This is such a tune! Not even meant for this era. It's from an era when they were CLASSICS!
Agree
The way “Dick In A Box” inspired this song
Revenge song to doja cat's  aint shit so funny  and hilarious 😅😂
The song starts when Anderson pops into frame. Everything else is just the prelude.
The fits, the choreo, the lyrics, the vocals, the performance - *PERFECTO!* 🚬🥰
💯💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is my new, apparently old , favorite.  Lol. I love that shit.
Them guys are sensational,if only I was about 30 years younger ring future husband would be tall dark and very good looking
This group is just what the musical genre needs!

I’m a 77 yr. old and I love this!! Have played this continually for days - at least 50 times! The melody is fantastic and the lyrics are hilarious! Bruno Mars and Anderson.Pacc are the greatest combination since “chicken and waffles” ❤
何度も聴いてしまう大好きな歌♪
loved it so much😍💕
Genial 👍🎬
Anybody doubt it doesnt recognize talent. I sing and stream and do alllll shit. Bruno and Pak got that fire. This isnt an accident . I absolutely love this track,style and everything about it. Anyone say some else is a daft fkn idiot.
I hadn't watched this in a year.  Came back and it's just as good as the first time I saw it!  Mad talent from both Bruno and Anderson, and their background singers as well.
I think that this song a cool way of telling a 304 that she belongs in the streets.
This my theme song for my sad moments (tho i'm not smoking) 🚭🤣🧊
esto sencillamente es MUSICA de la que te enriquece el alma, el cuerpo y toda la vida!!!❤
I’m not gay but Bruno mars voice gets me hard
"chucky cheese" jajajaja
This song is such a banger. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤ love this
The nicest way to say 'she belong the street'.
❤ this song is it
Echoes of 60s and 70s R&B...this sounds so damn amazing.
Dear husband, please sing again
Oh this sure brought me back to the 70’s on Saturday morning watching Soul Train! This is extremely, over the top the best video I’ve seen that depicts the 70’s AND makes me lmao 🤣 at the same time! 😂 thank you!
“I thought that girl belonged to only me” is so pleasing to my ears it sounds so nice
❤❤❤ really love this song
Thank you Anderson and team
I liked how when Anderson was laying down on that flow
VERY BEAUTIFUL 😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This song really ticks with a lot of guys out there.
The only thing that's missing is Don Cornellius. -mikenotpaula.
Se la dedico a mi gato que me tiene gastando en arena 😢
The vibe!!! I’m like a-rockin’ silly, horizontal on a hammock, sipping piña colada (with a cute little umbrella hangin’ off it too) ☀️🏝️🥹🍹
That cigarette ash flick is more on point than my life can ever be 😅😂😂
Is this song about being cheated on?
Thank you guys for saving the sound of the 70s and RNB.
なんて素晴らしく、カッコイイ曲！ 大好きです❤❤❤
Oh my gosh 😂.... He actually died and rose up to finish his verse....Oh..... So hilarious....
두려움 상실.
Reminds me of 2010-2013 Bruno
Oh yeah smoking out the window cool babe
Smoking tobacco is NOT cool!  I hope that Bruno Mars and the people in this music video all didn’t get lung cancer or any diseases as a result of cigarette smoking.
Who wrote the lyrics 😂🤣
Why is this song so hilarious AND good 😭
If there’s one word to describe Bruno Mars music it’s consistent, he never fails to live up to people’s expectations of his music. I can’t believe its already been two years since this was released!
Silk sonic Soo good ❤ love them too
I love 💕 Bruno Mars
top tier music with top tier vocals, sprinkled with comedy, absolutely brilliant
브루노 너무  좋아❤
SO did it mean when Bruno started smoking on the grammy's it took a reference to this upcoming or is it inspired fr the Grammy incident. either way. Genius!

She was “Community Property”😂😂😂
"not to be dramatic, but I wanna DIEEEEE!" 😂
Not liking normalizing using the B word to describe a woman’s behavior but the song is nucleotomic!!
😍😍
fantastic Band, we got it on Vinyl ❤🧡💛💚💙💜👍👍👍
Is that Bruno’s big bro in the drums?
Getting MJ VIBES from BRUNO MARS.... 😌😌😌
Damn they are finE❤
I think Stevie Wonder is the center tattoo on Anderson’s chest. I have to see if I can google who his tattooes are of.
Their voice fits perfect to each other ❤❤❤
The perfect wedding song doesn’t exi……
Masterpiece. Yeah I said it. Their best and biggest work yet. Bringing that eighties nineties sound back. It's what music needs cuz what's a song without a bridge or a breakdown. They had stopped doing that I noticed for a while and music modern day was failing. Thank you and thank God for  Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak and Silk Sonic
Yes I'm still here watching because I love the song and looking at group where everyone is fine as hell also brings me back 😅😊❤
私はただ好きな曲が聴きたいだけ ・ω・悪いか？
Bruno looks like Sammy Davis jnr with the hairstyle, moustache & sunnies.
Wow, LORD HAVE MERCY..THIS SONG IS HYSTERICALLY MUSICALLY THERAPEUTIC, LISTEN UNDERSTAND EMBRACE, I LOVE IT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🎼🙏🌺
I used to love this song until my ex ruined it for me! He would always listen to this song! But I won’t let him ruined it for me
I love it Real real smooth
This is simply amazing.

Omg, I love this song 😂

邊個睇完造星5過嚟？
둘의 매력이 합쳐져 특별하면서 강력한 매력이 넘친다. 앤더슨의 코믹에 미소짓다가 섹시한 브루노의 그루브와 음색에 빠져들게 하는 노래. 얼마나 무한반복으로 들었는지 모른다.
Is Stevie Wonder the front man on Anderson’s chest??????
I like most of his music I don’t like he is saying a bad word about a woman in it. But I think he could of done better in this songs like using different words for a woman in a respectful way
Sample ?

The best thing about this song is the girls that like this song dont realize this song is about them 😂😂
Chad Anderson made Ninoy Aquino cosplay
Filipinos look Hispanic, eat Asian and sing like black people. Shout out to all the soulful Blackapinos. Most people don't know they (Filipinos )were originally called Negritos. They were invaded by and mixed with the Japanese, then Spanish, and finally the Americans. Many black American soldiers defected and joined Filipino forces against America to help them win their war for independence. Shout out to all my Blackapinos!
I laugh at this video every time like I've never seen it before. It just gives me such a giggle. So much talent and humor. Gotta love it!
kinda sounds like in the start they are on that simp shit.

Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

As a Filipino I found this song because I saw a facebook post about  a Ninoy Aquino cosplay and all I can say is... Perfection
this is the melodramatic way to tell a girl she belongs to the streets
1:43 cosplay ni ninoy aquino x silk sonic & bruno mars
They are absolute pros.
Nice🔥💯👍🏿
Anderson .Paak as Ninoy Aquino x Bruno Mars 🙈 1:43
@1:44 ninoy aquino reference lol
Lol
Si Bro Ninoy Aquino ay bumulagta🔥🗣️
Bruno you smoke cool bro
Kanye and Jamie had it figured out. We just would not listen.
1:44 Ninoy cosplay
1:44 eh nag ninoy aquino cosplay
1:43 ninoy aquino
Sino yung andito dahil dun sa ninoy aquino cosplay? 😂
It's amazing to me that they are so versatile. This music sounds like it was recorded in the seventies. They are really talented. Please keep the same music coming!
이노래에 푹빠져 산다 ㅎㅎ
Ninoy cosplay moments 1:43
God damn this is just oozing funk
here for the “THIS BITCH” line 😂
Too smooth ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮😅😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
When anderson fell on the ground and just stranded was the part for me to say this:I CANT STOP THE FUCK LAUGHING IN THIS BITCH PLACE WITH AN GOOFY AAA ASS MEEPCITY PERSON🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Effin' SMOOTH!
This song is two very whiny, pouty boys that got their heart hurt. They probably callin her a gold digger when they probably used money in replacement for true genuine emotional vulnerable love. So they just blame her for everything wrong about them and then go back "to the club" like that's gonna change the outcome next time HAHAHA
Is he saying "This bitch"? Lord! Who wrote that song?😕
when they come back ?
It’s 2023 I’m Still Smokin OutThe Window These Guys Did An Awesome Performance On This Album They Need To Do Another Album Together
This is awesome work.
🎉❤❤❤
Beliver
God
This master collaboration is the best thing that happened during pandemic
This song deserves an award.. 💓
Bruno is this generation’s version of Sammy Davis Jr!!!
Real music 💯
Smokin Out Of Window Bruno Mars,Anderson,Paak,Silk Sonic Bruno Mars and Silk Sonic Songs Anderson and Paak Songs
Pare......FIRE!!!!!!!! You making me miss singing with my band. We did Philippines in 1997!!!!!
Bruno is always so SMOOTH with it! He grooves with every piece of instrument. He's like...a smoother version of Elvis. Which if I remember correctly he loved Elvis. And Anderson well, he's in a category of his own. Awesome harmony of talent right here, including all the producers and composers; whoever else is involved in Silk Sonic.
Good R&B stuff but Bruno should work with Lizzo composer and producer
you are not michael jackson
💝💝💝💝😍💝💝💝💝
Incrível como sempre ❤
This is what exactly my friend experienced with his ex-gf. Made me laughed when i heard it. Shared it to him right away. Lol 😂
Damn I mean my heart been broke but I have yet to meet a bitch that has made me smoke out the window shit 😂 I wanna meet a bitch that can get me smoking out the window of the Benz Lmao
you see people say that the weeknd is the new micheal jackson but i think Bruno Mars is

musically pleasing and a great production. It's funny too! And that's the thing, it's not serious. Not every song needs to be, but it's different when it's not a parody, but the actual thing.
Bruno mar is the best singer ever
Bruno is a he don’t miss kind of guy so is Anderson 🤘🏽🔥🔥🔥🎶
Still can’t get over that James Ingram bit Bruno did!!
Why the drummer look like Bruno Mars' uncle bruh smfh
I love this song and videos but I can't lie, Anderson paak is hilarious in this video. Definitely a tour I wanna catch
I hope you find whatever it is you need.  I also hope that your trifling azz is walking around barefoot in these streets  😂😂
👍
One passage and return in the 70's years!!!!!!!!!!!!!Very great music of my youth!! Merci de France pour ces doux souvenirs!!
Que vibe mds kkkkkk
Everytime I listen to this, it makes me think of what'll be in my future.
Da end is so funny
70s mood♥️
You have to really admire their ability to keep real music alive. This type of talent comes around once in a generation. Bruno Mars is an all-time great. He is like the Denzel of music; he never makes a bad song.
💙
My husband just sent me this video very randomly.
Lol b*tch robbed me 😅😂😂😂😭💔
GREATEST ALBUM 🐐
Incrível e pra sonhar acordado de lindo ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Bruno vc seu grupo 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤

Already a classic
😊😊

Great song! Next time without the 'bitch' word, dude.
Their residency in Vegas was one hell of a show
A vibe dessa música é ótima demais, repito ela umas 10 vezes kkkk
I just rewatched this and this song had me laughing so hard.
Anderson laying on the ground will never not be the funniest moment in this music video
❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I want to come see y'all I want to come see you right now
This is one of those songs that you can roller skate to...and just glide across the floor.
Choreography on point,awesome.
An couple hookers for the night would be cheaper and much better memories than trying to get a gold digging be loyal to a man.
Que show !!! Super top das galáxias!❤
Anderson is one talented motherfucker
really love this song
Foda pra caralho, o maluco é bom!!!
Wahlgrens värld brought me here
There's not many like yourselves any more ❤
This song hits hard
These guys should do a cover of Fantastic Voyage by Lakeside and put their own spin on it... Silky Smooth. Love Silk Sonic
Can we all just appreciate how good the simple choreography in the video is.  Like the foot taps on the Hercules line @ 1:18
“Not to be dramatic, but….”😂😂😂
Não canso de ouvir esses dois maravilhosos!😊
I appreciate Bruno Mars putting up with the gays long enough to make this classic♥️
What a master piece of video! The set, the wired mics, PAR64 lights, and all the drama.
Some good music from these cool and smooth gentlemen. Thanks for the music
Nice
Smoking Out The Window = an EXCUSE to use Chuck E Cheese as part of the lyrics :P OOPS Bruno Mars: That's true 100% 😁
Bruno Mars is the GOAT.. remember that
Everything about them is perfection ❤
This is the song that plays when you beat the end boss of Music 🎩
TÃO TRISTE QUE NÃO VOU PODER VER O SHOW EM SETEMBRO
immaculate rizz
“Chucky cheese” got me😭
😅😅😅 so tru to people I know who stay separated n divorced
This hits even harder when you're with a girl who doing you wrong. Such a cathartic song.
Funny and I love your songs but please delete one of them that have cussing in it not smoking at doing those kids running around inside your house bro little bro that's why you're so funny and that's why he's so funny and just letting you put that cousin stuff out cuz my grandma my grandma gets here you understand bro okay you understand we'll just so funny this song is that I'm playing right now okay

And who ever thought about this collabortion is just a pure genius from the vocals to the moves and the way Paak fake fainted was really funny. And Bruno mars vocals are like liquid gold as well as the background singers because the added a little kick to this song. Again Amazing! Fire!

Bruno is modern day micheal jackson
Silk Sonic needs to come back because I was dancing to all of their songs throughout 2021. THE NOSTALGIA!! 😂
We have to say an eternal thanks to Mars and .Paak's parents for introducing these kids to great 70s soul so they could bring this soulful sound to new generations 🙂
When you break up with ur Girl, Then you listen to this song, After you listen to it. “I Feel Better Now”
Happy to see an ode to some of the greatest music in history; Motown. Smokey, the Temptations, the Stylistics and all the greats from an era gone by. Except that we would have never included the "B-word," but beyond that, this just goes to show the diverse skills of Bruno, Anderson and the other talented artists in this video. Music for multiple generations.
This song hit so hard when it first came out, but now that im down terrible it hits so much harder lmao
That getting up off the floor thing cracks me up every time!
charming music and really good music , ty :)
I have been listening to such depressing music of late and have wondered why I feel so depressed so I decided to play some upbeat songs.  I started with Uptown Funk.  This cat is so talented.  I start scrolling through his music and stumble across this.  Really?  SO funny and good at the same time.  It's a spoof that you almost want to have played at your wedding.  But, if she makes me smoke out the window, that marriage thing is out the window.
This song is a hard and pure red pill
That girl doesn't belong to the streets, she belongs to the city! 🎶
The algorithm tells me I should like this song…..
That extended time on the floor was 🔥 fire. " I wanna die."😂
La voz de Bruno Mars es sin duda de las mejores en la actualidad, QUE BUENA CANCIÓN!!!
100%
THEIR SUITS THOUGH???!!!!?? <3
❤❤❤❤❤
I can definitely relate to this song.
Drug Song 😁 Good Times
this is popular but i actually have never heard of it before i think
Bruno es el mejor artista que tenemos en la actualidad Multi instrumentista, compositor, productor y una voz privilegiada
This guy don’t miss classic
It's amazing to me that they are so versatile. This music sounds like it was recorded in the seventies. They are really talented. Please keep the same music coming!
555555555t
the set is Simple and it works with the theme of the song and style
Wonderfull song
I want Charlie Wilson To make a remake of this song Billions In 3 weeks
I'm just saying Anderson Paak got this 1
When Anderson slides in at 0:32 I die every time.
This music video is a masterpiece. Now I want a brown velvet tux.
The 80’s version of ‘she for the streets’
I started watching One Piece with this song!
This whole album is just amazing❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They killed it
oh my gosh
1:34 me everytime I have to pay the bills
Eu já era apaixonada pelo Bruno e agora sou mais apaixonada ainda por essa parceria foda ❤ Silk Sonic apostou todas as fichas e ganhou de lavada meus ouvidos 😍💖 Som maravilhoso pra se ouvir em uma boa companhia e um bom vinho num fim de noite ! Nota 1000 😍😍
I love me some Silk Sonic.  I'm always checking for the big sexy bros in the back!

Love it, but I get jarred every time I hear that B word!!
Bringing that old school sensation it feels good
Dale  lol 😂 Manny just enjoying my own shit lol
The question is  how she did this to her kids!!? Wrong mother, and mother! Not your problem! Definitely the Mom's problem!!! Fr, Fr!!! Mother's  look out for their babies, and never bring truck to your house!!! You want to hook up??? Well hook up without hooking  up with you at your house!!! Never, ever do that! Get your groove on somewhere else... But never with your kids!!! Hear me now!!! Never with your kids!!! Never, ever!!! Get it, yo???!! Get it yo!!!!
You two are so perfect 💗
❤️
Personally mixed opinion: I really dig the rhythm yet can't get behind the cigarette promo, as a guy who remains quit from smoking for 9 years.  #bittersweet
Whoever that Community HŒ they’re singing about is surely hurting them to make this amazing song lol 😂

Wowwwwww Bravo 👏🏻
"give her back to the city" that line hits hard
Smooth
I could find 100 things this song does worse than the original style, despite the fact it has some redeeming things about it. This often wavers straight into comedy. Please tell me that is not the point.
i was honestly just waiting for him to say "she belongs to the street~"
I Loveeee ❤️🤩
Anderson Paak went in no CAP!!!!!!

Que ginga...que som!!!
This music is so fun and brings back memories of the days of soul /f n b music  ie tempations ,stylistics and many more of there era .. Silk sonic are  fantastic love their sound 😜 and doesnt Bruno look great with his tash !!!!  .Wow what else can I say ,great sounds and  brilliant to watch  ..❣❣❣❣
Isn't Silk Sonic just Bruno and Paak? Seems weird to credit the duo and both of them individually in the title.
1:34 "Not to be dramatic, buy i wanna die" 5 sec later he is deafff 🤣🤣🤣
Man !!! This song is hilarious!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm not born in 70's, 80's, nor 90's, but this song along with the music video is just... *masterful...*
this is so fun!!!
This video is smokin'!
Lovveeeeee
this shit is ass dog make lazy song 2
The lyrics 🤣 can we talk about the drums tho???
Ladies see how men feel so I say your solution be INDEPENDENT
This is the song Nathan Davis Jr's sister almost got whupped for. I'm glad i recognized one of the voices becsuse i wanted to listen to it ever since then
I love the old-school R&B style (good harmonies, instruments actually playing great music, is awesome to hear nowadays).

Absolutely awesome!
Silk Sonic's next album should be based on 80's R&B.
This is one of coolest music video I've ever seen....
Wait he said this "b...  With the cigarette in his hand in the video 😧
Lindo

Perfect♥️
nice tune,cracks me up
The judge well rule in the wife favors  if she sleep with another man the husband will have pay child support.
Your kids r bolging on the internet so watch and be careful  they also pass the law about child support if you  r married the husband dosen't have the money the wife has too pay the for it if your child gets some one pregnant the mother and father has too pay. These r the laws  they even take unemployment benefits wages.
que buenos fps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nw_ob4IeOo  imposible no recordar esto
i usually just listen to death metal and doom metal and dislike pop music, but bruno mars i definitely an exception
THIS is cultural appreciation, idk Abt that Disrespectful sh_t y'all be doing.
This group is so insanely talented, from R&B to Pop, Regae, Rock old School twist in coriography and just raw talent they will be selling out arenas for a long while @ a pretty ticket price. I for one will pay the price for admissions.
I always sing this part to my man and add a little more.... "this bitch got me paying for trips, paying her rent, paying her car, paying her phone, paying her food" and he cracks up all the time!!

Bruno low-key sounded like jk at 0:27
When are you coming to Europe, Bruno, Anderson and Silk Sonic?
It's Bruno for meee!!! Love him!!!
The way I’m soo im love w Bruno Mars 😍😍
If she is not your property, she is a public property
I love this video because it's funny when Bruno says her kids are running thru his house like it's Chucky Cheese. That was a visual the moment he said "...like it's Chucky Cheese."
Am I th only one who thought Anderson's Shadow looked like blood. Like he died for reals. LoL
This song makes me happy though which is strange
💞💞💕💕💕
I feel privileged to have Bruno Mars in my generation
it's only been about 2 years now but this became nostalgic
Very smooth
We not gonna talk about Bruno!
I thought it was Bruno mars saying “Smoking up the weed ooohhhh” but it was window lol
EXCELLENT!!!
Does anybody else wish Bobby “Blue” Bland was alive to do a cover of this?
This song is too fine
💯
1:19 😂💕
Michael Jackson has two son ....Bruno Mars and the Weeknd
Song's want me to smoke again and go reminiscing the things that went wrong.
Ay keep it up Bruno follow god and just be safe out there I’m a big fan later man
Kills me everytime cause it hits home 😅😅😅

👏👏👏👏
The best one?     Yes.
“not to be dramatic but i wanna die” HAHAJAHHAAHHAHA I LOVE IT!!!
Bruno's voice is very adaptable. He fits with those sould singers of the 70's as well as pop.
How they keep poppin up right on queue with a “ this bi$$” is soooo perfect lmao😂
Excellent 🔥🔥🔥
This song is the classy version of saying she belongs to the streets
- Did the line go wrong?
Amo demais esses caras, eles são maravilhosos. Brasil 17/02/2023

Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (ooh, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody), ooh
Some meaningful lyrics 👏👏
Is it just me or does AP look like Dave Chappelle?
Best album in so long! Guys are all so talented. And by the way, the last great SB halftime show (14). Bringing RHCP in was epic.
Amo tanto ouvir as músicas deles, sempre me fazem bem😍❤️

They are so wrong for sounding that good.  That’s what the get for leaving the door open!  They should have closed it once she came in.😂😂😂

Should be stroking out the window😂
The vibe is unmatched
To think about it this song is one of my favorites but at the same time other songs that I love by Bruno Mars and the band Silk Sonic.
Let's all just take a moment to appreciate how Bruno Mars went from "I'd catch a grenade for you"  and " Just the way you are..."  to "This bitch, got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips"
BRO WAS LAID OUT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bitch hit them bricks 🤣
Swear to God I saw this live the week I got corona that's probably why I recovered soon lol

They enjoyed this album and making this video it's clear
Está es la mejor que tiene y la de skate también mueve mis fibras más internas 💜 💜
Fucking hilarious this is
When Bruno said "This Bitch" i felt that lol ive been there
She made this man go from wanting to be a billionaire to this bitch got me .... lolz
Sou brasileiro e escuto todos os dias fumando na janela 😂
Damn this 9is what i call music and then some damn my favorite style Ever.. True R& B at some of its finest!!
😆 🤣 😂
The realest song ever written.
i see a young Dwayne The Rock Johnson Singin
I feel like Orange Juice Jones is telling a girl off in a romantic type of way
This song is off the hook, this beat is fire the vocals are top-notch it's definitely nostalgic lack of listening to Willie Hutch Meetss George Clinton Parliament funk
Veeeeem logo pro Brasil, meu amor!! Dia 10/09 te espero 😍❤️
This is too cuteee! 💗 Reminds me of “Nobody but you” by Wondergirls! 🫶🏼
You’re so talented dave chapelle
Withney Houston and Mariah Carey
This is the type of music we want back!!😍😍❤❤
that fallsetto and high notes 😲😲😲 2:44 and 2:50
this video is too hard
The dramatics 😂
Him laying on the floor then reviving a moment later kills me everytime
Bruno Mars funny asf 😮‍💨😭
B got me paying four trips paying her rent smoking purple out the window remix think about it Scooby-Doo
I would love to see Bruno in a duet with Randy Watson, from Sexual Chocolate
Be honest 2023 everyone this is still just a vibe
Pra mim, o único cara que têm capacidade de fazer algo próximo ao que Michael Jackson fez. Sensacional!
Anderson Paak said he "didn't want to be dramatic"...But he fell to the floor, died for quite a few bars of the song and popped right back up taking up the whole screen in perfect time...HILARIOUS yet perfect! That's what you call 'Show-N- Tell' ♥ 😂
Bad ass focus real straight up truth and love
Not me knowing all the choreography and dancing along! love this song
Guys and their drama. This is a riot.😆. Bruno however, is a major hottie with a great voice.
He said this love start-off so tender so sweet.... Said every man ever
if this isn't a masterpiece, idk what is
Such a bad song!!!
1:33 -1:51
1:43 never laugh so hard at a music video my entire life
If even Bruno mars is tired of woman’s shit what does that say?
RIAA 2X Platinum 💿 (Jan 30, 2023):  "Smokin Out The Window" by Silk Sonic (BrunoMars & Anderson .Paak) has sold 2 million units in the US. Congratulations Bruno and Andy ✨🎉
Esse é de um nível muuuuuito acima da realidade musical atual SLK
A classic reminds me of a Saturday night

Old school feel. Love it! Miss this kind of music with great chemistry and harmony and instruments!
Thought the "Love's train" is also here in this album

Bruno Mars would make a great host for Soul Train! Love this!
These two dudes so talented and then Bruno so dope he soooo underrated dude a monster

pro tip - lowering the screen pixel to  240p can really give u those 70s vibes
Бруно второй Лини, да чё там Лини, тембрально Майкл, но с подачей Джамироквай! Может я стар уже и сентиментален, просто чувак крут, привет с Кавказа!
The musical arrangements and the production are amazing. It is worth studying at universities. Regards Bruno, from Cala D'or, we are waiting for you one day to visit our area in Mallorca
Women are beautiful 😍
I hope you can make an official music video of count on me, I've been waiting for it for 6 years boss Bruno Mars 😁😁
Y’all had no right to make a music video this fly!!!

Bruno Mars hit the high notes
I can't imagine how my feeling watching this guy live while I'm drinkin😩
This music is viben my inner soul🥰
This. Bitch. Got me paying the rent 🤣

Asides from the misogynistic undertones this song is pretty catchy
Honestly I love how Bruno is trying to bring this style of music back, and he's bringing it back in spades.
thanks for the song guys. i love it when mr. anderson kept popping up in the screen unexpectedly 🤌🏻
Love's Train Bruno Mars,Anderson,Paak,Silk Sonic

This was my dog’s favorite song. Every time he heard it he would spin. He passed away at 7 years old 12/6/22 from cancer. I miss him so much 💔
A letra dessa música é profunda e mostra bastante sobre a pílula vermelha
Amazing 👌
Hilarious, sad and genius song all rolled into one ❤️
Quando vejo os vídeos do Bruno Mars eu já penso que vem coisa boa. Que perfeição ele cantando com o Anderson Paak. Amo demais essa voz mainhosa do Anderson. Que perfeição!
the cut to anderson paak completely dead on the floor 😂
From "I was your man" to "Smokin' out the window" is like first timer vs experienced😂😂😂😂

👏👏
1:27 TO 1:37 IS ME RN CAUSE MY TEACHER FAILED ME FOR EXISTING AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
WHERE IS HEEEE
De CD van Bruno mars is het iets of niets? Smoking out the window is een CD van Bruno Mars samen met Anderson Paak. In dat nummer zingen ze over een relatie wat uit is gegaan. Bruno Mars is een goede artiest die veel goede muziek maakt bijvoorbeeld Uptown funk. Hij was eerst een producer voor andere artiesten, daarna is hij uitgegroeid tot een bekende zanger. Hij is populair bij oudere mensen maar ook bij jongere mensen.   Het liedje Smoking out the window is een lied wat valt onder popmuziek. De muziek bouwt op wat dat betekent is dat het zachtjes begint en steeds harder gaat, daarna bouwt het weer af tot het lied stopt. Tussen door gebeurd dat ook een paar keer. Ik vind dat Bruno Mars goed kan zingen. Dat hoor je ook terug in het nummer
why not sing she belong to the streets
You're so talented man I like you so much
BEST COLLAB SO FAR <3
Any woman that couldn’t fall for him is crazy using him he is too damn good looking take 20 yrs off of mt life and what a life we would or could of had go get then pm keep it up all of you you hpguys are great that sound that everyone wants back come on and bring it to me baby
This group is amazing and Bruno only adds the icing on the cake. Their voices are amazing 🤩

"Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need.  But I also hope your trifling a** is walking round barefoot in these streets," 🤣🤣🤣 First time I heard this I laughed thinking "how petty", but the truth is only very few people can genuinely wish their exes the best in life especially if the breakup was bad.
They remind of the 80's group SWITCH but they are so smooth and so good to listen too.
This song shows me i am SOOO GLAD I AM NOTTT A KARMIC.I AM A DEVINE FEMININE A CHOSEN ONE THANKS TO MY HIGH VIBRATING ANCESTORS AND THE DEVINE PERIOD💙💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜.
This damn video is funny as hell!!!😂😂😂
❤❤❤
Dude deserves all the pussy he gets.
Nothing even compares to these guys. They’re the best.
ブルーノマーズさん、いいなあ！
Fuckin' finally, bringing it back. Been around long enough now, that I get to see this kind of harmonizing songs come into fashion, leave and now come back again. Woooo! Sing it boys, smooth as angora silk.
These ni66as is ICE COLD!!🥶
Damn Bruno, I felt this.
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa eu sou apaixonada
Bruno Mars  You sliced and diced this one real good
This is so strange. Very smooth but just an odd song
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
Heelll yeahh

1:37 BRUNO CAME OUT SWINGIN 👏🏽 🤣
Silk Sonic Songs
I'm 66. Thank you Bruno, Anderson, and Silk, for bringing back GOOD music
No way this was a year ago🥲
Something Berry Gordy would be proud of.
I loved the Tempts for decades but currently, Bruno and Anderson is killing it. No disrespect Otis.
wow, just noticed Bruno's older brother is on the drums in the background. cool stuff
This is the greatest Diss track song to tell ya'll SHE BELONGS TO THE STREET
Once a month I come back and watch this master piece. If you have days that it's hard to even smile... do the same. 💓💓💓
😉
They done slammed the damn door
This is how I feel when I got over a break up
Oh,now I love this.
In it to win it Cincinnati Ohio
This song reminds me that character development hits everyone no matter the status
I hope your good but also hope your tiflin ass walking barefoot in these streets. GROWTH *claps*
Just never get over this masterpiece.
“But I wanna die” lmaoooo then he just lays there. I can’t 💀💀💀💀
Puff off queeeeeeen ;)
Bruno's unreal falsetto. Anderson's bringing fire. Can't really get any better than this.
Ole bang bus boiiiiii
T Mac. Hy  aka silk and sonic
What's with them smoking.. anyway this Bruno guy is getting boring no joke.. same old shit again same time same colour background no dance all old tricks. Gone with the days when he used to make some good music!
Just know this song 2 days ago and i love it better than their other song, surprised this only have 147m views after 1 year
goat
A year later and paac on the floor is still 😂
they remind the era of 90'z
Nice song waooow
my new tripping song😶‍🌫
Real Music 💯
How Bruno managed to keep singing with Anderson laying on the floor I will never understand. If their genius wasn’t already clear, it certainly is after that.
Ha ha ha......😘
Damn so feel good
EDNIS SA BINTANA
เพลงนี้ดีมากคนแต่งทำนองเก่งมากเพลงนี้ตั้งแต่ยุค70ฟังทำนองอย่างเดียวก็เพลินแล้วไม่ต้องรู้ภาษาแค่ฟังทำนองก็เพลินแล้ว
เพลงนี้ตั้งแต่ยุค70ทำนองดนตรียังฟังใด้ไม่ตกยุคถึงแม้จะฟังภาษาไม่ออกแต่ก็ฟังดนตรีใด้ไม้ตกยุคคิดดูคนสมัยก่อนแต่งทำนองใด้ขนาดนี้ถือว่าเก่ง
Fumando na janela 🤭
Essa música é MUITO LOUCA
Temptations all over
Takes me back to the 70s
As dope as this is, Method man, Redman, and Eric Sermon were onto this at least 10 years earlier. Ms. International! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zNByABjotAc
Anderson was legendary with his adlibs fr
0:17 Got a bad [ _ ] kids running around over the whole crib like it’s Chuck E. Cheese

The sonic brothers be making real smooth cool soul music. Brothers please keep making soulful music. This one is comical but this joint is hitting
Chuck E' Cheese is that dank!  😂😂
I like the song. But they sound more like the 90s (New Edition) than the 70s (Temptations/Chi-Lites etc.) to me.
Somtyms kisses are sour but ur never sour . ## NIGHT SCORPION
I really like this song 🤣🤣🤣
This song is stupid

Lekk brunoo cenn muanteppppppp
They thought Bruno Mars was the Greatest of All Time Until Xclusyph Icon Exploded onto the airwaves Dominating It!!!!!!!!!
Why on earth do these people appreciate those electronic shit? When they have bruno
Frog it.
Donde es meijo es brilliante.
Smoke your own pot Clouser. Take a trip to Chuck e Cheese with my son whose codename is Bald Eagle.
Aqua ouevevos is my personal bodyguard. He hates you too.
Handle your bs Johnathan Zachar Clouser. You're a 55 wanna be alien.
The female version of this would be "I'm drinking in my bedroom"  Wait a second baby, this romance started off so true so innocent, so tender.  Now I'm, drinking in my bedroom. (Ooohhhh)  First verse. Must have spent 45 to 99 pounds up in Walmart (oh no). He didn't have credit, always said he had some issues with his debit card. (Hell no) Draining me dry with his bullshit, looking like his personal ATM.  Can't believe it (his an idiot).  I'm pissed off.  This tricks got me, Buying his gas, buying his drawers, taking him to stores, buying all the food.  And here I am all broke (I'm broke) This assholes got me smashing dishes. (Ooohhhh)  Chorus  I'm drinking in my bedroom. Thinking how could he run game on me. Girls, I thought that he could treat me really right. But I was wrong, he belongs,  Back to his mother, to his mother. (Ooohhhh)  2nd verse. Last night he was Tarzan, Swinging on my legs, like they were monkey bars (oh no) Cussing out his side chick. When her forehead is shaped like Mars (oh yes). Baby why you stupid, why'd you keep  bringing stress to me, boy.  It's time to kick you out, and it's time to leave.  This tricks got me. Buying his gas, buying his drawers Taking him stores, buying all the food. And here I am all broke (all broke) This assholes got me smashing dishes (Yeah).  Repeat chorus.   (Look here baby, I hope that you catch crabs when your rolling around in those sheets, but I also hope that trifling broke ass is walking around butt ass naked in these streets, look out)  Yes I'm going to complain. Your loves made me insane, And cos all of your dirt This shit never will work. So I'm evicting you out baby, yeahhh.  Repeat chorus.
1:33 Still funny 😂😂😂
Smooth... So smooth Bruno Mars
Love you and the song ❤❤❤❤❤
1x75  epic 🤩
Comedy mixed with smooth fire brilliant even now for Christmas eve vibes
this one vocalist looks like beetle juice
Orange Juice Jones vibesssss.
I’m sorry but Soloist Bruno Mars was better this is trash 🚮 take it out and let it decay. Go back to being a soloist these dudes are flat out holding you back. 😒
David Ruffin, Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin and Ollie Woodson would definitely love this one. I believe Uncle Otties Williams and Uncle Ron Tyson do love this one too. A perfect reflection of the Temptations lineup and mesmerizing voices!👌
No woman in humanity is, ever has been or ever will be fine enough to tolerate this level of drama. NOPE!
❤️❤️❤️
Uff
i dont believe this song only got Million views. This should be a Billion
omg.  ...never would I leave you smokin out the window!!!!!!  Love love love this!
This collab inspires me so much! Groovy, soulful and funny. Bruno Mars is the real deal, one of the most versatile contemporary artists who stands out with all that unbridled joy, lighthearted humor and his high-spirited personality. He delivers some of the most memorable performances filled with that nostalgic swag, soul and funk. One of my favourite performances of all time happens to be Valerie at the Amy Winehouse tribute concert, but I also love his more serious, heart-wrenching performances like It Will Rain ❤️
no one forced you to buy anything, stop blaming people
sooo many light flares. this is fun
Damn they turned “She belongs to the street” into art.
I love Bruno bringing back the vintage vibe
Perhaps there’s hope for the Music industry.
Freaky dicky yyy you ain't going to tell on me are you, not  in a New Day my lady
Freaky dickyyyy,what is this?, My lady this is that stuff that gets me in the mood,
Man seeing Paak in 1:43 literally face flat on the floor got me dying 💀
LMAOOOOOOOOOO HE'S FUCKIN DEAD
Aeg. G. 😊
This song caught me the moment Bruno sang "This bitch..."
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (that girl there, she belong to everybody), ooh Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass Is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out! Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (ooh, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody), ooh
Bruno Mars do me a favor I'm trying to ask Gail Miller to marry me she's in Utah sing a song about Gail Miller Marion me j o t h a n i don't know I'm 49 and I'm smoking out the window of the backyard and spend mine
To the n***** standing next to me as I write this your verse you're up, then don't get mad when you hear a pimp speaking I'm so cold I'm so cold you got me
Society is made by men for women and children. That's why so much of it doesn't make any sense. It never had to. It was only about making someone feel good in that moment
I have to say.. My favorite.
I was not prepared for the masterpiece that this song truly is. I am shook 😳 💀 🥰
Consistently my favorite song. How many months running is it? I'd ask my girl. But she left me for some health nut.
Favourite Since Decade Bruno Mars 🥺❤️
So smooth 😍😍
https://youtube.com/shorts/DiuvE3-9E-Q?feature=share

For rich people smoking by the window is like having a cigar by the fire place, for poor people it’s a berley menthol under the stove hood.

I always like Bruno Mars but never liked his simpy songs. Great to see even Bruno has taken the red pill and has a song that might as well be titled "She's for the streets" lmao
I love you BRUNO MARS ❤️💋
best review of this album I heard was "Silk Sonic are bringing back hairy pussy music"
Estou aqui mais uma vez ouvindo essa musica tomando coca cola bem gelada e relaxando.
Definitely Reminiscent of the 60's......Yes..... This is definitely the way they did it in the 60's folks.....end of lesson.....( Thanx Bruno, for bringing back the Class of the pass....end of story)
Been a year without hearing some music that bangs my ear. Tried to search for bruno songs and damn! I still hear it while sleeping 😂
this video is actually quite funny ngl
Man, goddayem. Buro mars ain't no singer. he's a VIBE YO!
Is this video the highest view on smoking
2:00 - 2:02 that footwork is smooth 😂
hey this kinda like SNL lonely island lyrics
My husband cracks up every time he hears this song, or sees the video.
Love this song so much
Wow….. again, again and again
Bruno Mars During This = Steve Smith From American Dad
Ok that's it. Bruno is gay with 100% certainty.
YES YES YES
If this is not the most hilarious, silky, straightforward way to explain that someone is for the streets… than idk what is.😂😂😂

Why do so many people still celebrate a product that causes lung cancer and heart disease?    Why do people want to kill their lungs with tobacco?    It (tobacco) causes all sorts of health problems ranging from cancer to emphysema and COPD.    Please quit glamorizing tobacco!
Congratulations 🚂❤️ おめでとうございます🎉

Bruno! We need more songs such as these!
THIS  SONG IS  FOR THE 'DIRTY NIGGA'S THAT CHEAT ON THEIR 'WOMAN ' DIRTY LOW DOWN  'WHOES
the entirety of this video/song really is a work of art.   from the matching of the musical style to the set design,  to the cinematography of the dude popping into frame to say "this bitch...."    to him laying on the carpet.    excellence all the way through
“Sensational” - Future
THIS SONG IS FUNNY AS HELL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is my mind 😍😍😍.  But Bruno hope you are alright big man, losing weight in a way though....
my senior year econ teacher played this song when it came out and was singing along. the coolest teacher i’ll ever have
🎶Got me smoking out the window🎵 brought me back to classic 60s 70s jam
0:32 and 1:37 the amazing part😊😊
Make your permanent Star in the history of American music ....Love you guys...
You made good music my Afro Pilipino brothers. You don't even know how I am so very proud of you. Goodluck!
This song/group is a better Time Machine than the Tardis!   Got me 16 years old again, in my bedroom, listening to WBLS, Soul Train, WWRL, and SCREAMING at the radio and almost fainting!  This song is also hysterical AND cathartic!  ♫♪♥
Show up in SA
This is so clean dude awesome. I love it you guys are awesome.
Si je m aime Allah il même ou coi
Jolie jolie Hella bien
The lights, the blings, the scenario, whoever is behind the editing too, blessings! This is beautiful!

Everything Bruno touches turns to gold🤟🤟🙌🙌
Not the fake death tho!!! I fucking love this song HAPPY THANKSGIVING 😊
I refuse to believe it has been a year since this dropped 🤔 🤣🤣 I remember listening to it on repeat for the entire month non stop
I felt it when he said "THIS BITCH got me paying her rent."
I love all of them not just Bruno ❤️

I am sorry but I am very unhappy that this gem did not win at the AMA awards last night.   :(
Meus neurônios pulam de alegria !
Just an imitation of real greatness
Bruno has not achieved his due recognition.  So talented.  Compared to no one.
Oh my the effects of the zoom soft blurs got me laughing for nostalgia hahaha seriously this is good stuff
02:31 amazing😭😭😭
Que tudo de bom, apaixonante ouvir.
중독성 쩐다 계속 찾아 보네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ🎉
歌はもちろん演奏・演者・舞台・楽器・照明すべて最高じゃ The singing, the performances, the performers, the stage, the instruments, the lighting, everything was great!
This is so relaxing song for me it's so smooth..
Me recuerda a Michael Jackson 😍

EU TE AMO, BRUNO MARS, EU TE AMO.
fab fab fab
But I have to say is that the shoe fits wear it and wear it well.
the moves tho
oh no，so perfect with that appearance
Man.. how am I barely hearing this song.. that first close up and transition to Anderson was just too smooth.   .. "this b**** got me paying the rent" 😂
Ooh!wee!!!💋
Meu Deus como nao canso de ouvrir essa musicalidade esplendida!impecavel!vcs sao maravilhosos!
Love me some Bruno Mars 🚀
Smoking out the window he Musta. The foster the fox
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I'm late like hell forgive me.  I just got into this but you can tell Bruno was mad when he pronounced b*tch correctly...
This is the R&B, Soul, Funk, Pop, and Disco music people enjoyed back in the day.  I'm happy because Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak and Silk Sonic are bringing back those older sounds to make this crazy year of 2022, and these crazy times we're living in more pleasant.  I hope Silk Sonic can stand the test of time 50 years from now, just like The Isley Brothers and The Temptations are doing now.
COOL
❤ I love Bruno
Anderson Paak is such a passionate and amazing performer, WOW! And in this vid he had me cracking up the whole time! He shows up out of no where 0:32 "This! ... b***h!.....Got me" 😂 And when he taps the cig 0:33 I WAS SCREAMIIIING!! 🤣🤣 Later the groove is going along smoothly and 1:43...is he still on the ground?🤣  Then he pops up from the floor  OMG 1:51 🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 GENIUS!    Wonderful singing, dancing and pure comedy!   The words! 😛🤣🤣 Just great entertainment all around! Adore this performance
💞

Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this?

Chaka Khan used to sound like this,Then he started smoking in the window.
FUNNY AND REAL AT THE SAME TIME

앤더슨이 처음 시작 부분에서 박자  시작하는게 드러머 출신인지라 뛰어나네. 디테일이 다른 사람과 다르네요.

Mr.bruno sr umm...man....dude 😎 man thanks sr
Why does it remind me of Michael Jackson?

Wow Anderson is full of comedy really anyway its nice song keep it up Bruno and Anderson, we love you guys so much
This song shouldve been way 500 million by now. Come on new generation lol
Bruno Mars/ Silk Sonic got that 70’s/ Motown motif.
Children running around the house like chunky cheese 🤣🤣🤣
Beauty lovely❤️⭐❤️
for sure this song came out I were in my mom's womb remaining five months to be begotten but I said " I can't wait let me born, so l broke into my mom's womb and come out to enjoy this song, "smoking out the window"
Silk Sonic, Thanks to you, I don't smoke out the window no more.
Malah turu
0:32 to 0:42
Anderson came in @ 0:32 with authority talking about dis bitch, hahaha
Imagine Bruno mars retire from music? He’s such an icon 😭😭🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶
I kind of want to know how she can do this because it’s deliberate indifference and it’s against state and federal law Geneva convention and what United Nations just ask United States to do which is no more psychological torture and social isolation which is 15 hours or more
the vibes are immaculate!
Great song
Самсунг
Sounds more Smooth Sonic to me! ❤
😍🥰😘❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💯💯💯💯💯💥💥💥💥👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
ese si es buena cancion
I've listened to this song at least 100 times, and the end still gives me goosebumps. "I'm so cold, I'm so cold..."  Okay come on that was a good joke
The fact that Paak fainted from his disbelief of her but got back up just in time to follow along 😂
happy 1 year to this iconic song 💃🏽
Hoy hace un año se estrenaba mi canción favorita del álbum An Evening With Silk Sonic❤💫

You should've not left the door open guys 😂
The way dude was laid out on the floor and got back up on time with the words 🤣🤣🤣
I love this song.  The lyrics and the dance moves and the harmonies are spot on.  And on top of everything else it is funny as hell.  Would love to see them in concert.

THE VIBE OF JACKSONS 5 I LOVE IT I LOVE YOU BRUNO MARS ❤❤💝
Why does the darkskin dude on the right look like he’s crying when he sing 😂😂
I don't really know how the music business works, it seems that the names of the singers and dancers in the back we are not supposed to ask their names.  I have a favorite, I love the way he he dances and he is just so smooth in his movements.  maybe someday they will let us know their names, until then I will just keep watching
Check Morissette performance 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🔥🔥🔥  https://youtu.be/J4R3ynC4OQE
Sexy Bruno...
Se é lokko Cachoeira o Cara canta muito Show de bola 😂😂💯
I love you Bruno !!!!!!!!
É muito bom ser fã de talentos MDS que delícia
Gold
🔥 🔥 🔥
nigga music yo
DAYUM!  In between the laughter for the funniest lyrics in 3 decades, can be heard one of the tightest, most soulful R&B performances since the Main Ingredient (IYKYK).  These cats are the Real Deal!!!
I like the retro smoking.  You don't see that much anymore.
My man😍 so cool song bruno
The choreo is on POINT
PLEASE PLEASE CAN YOU GUYS DO RENDITIONS OF SOME EARTH WIND AND FIRE HITS...
Nice and smooth. Bruno looks like the young Michael Jackson. Cool dancing moves . Just the cigarettes a lil haha
What is Rodeo aim too..... it relates to Bruno. Who gave this to you! I know what happened!  I was capped by a person, you are blind to it,  I can  explain,  SAFELY? Thank You!
I came to Silk Sonic via Bootsy Collins... I said if he approves, I gotta check this out! Well well well! Funk & Soul are still here!! Love this!
I don't like music I love music
Amazing groove, I love this music so much, the harmonies, the dancing, too bad they waste it all on sexist tropes. It's so funny I think (I THINK, can't be sure) that in a decade artists like this, whose main goal is probably not to be misogynist, mean or provocative but are all about the music, won't do this anymore. Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars (and The Weekend as well, he's a good example) all have terribly sexist lyrics, but get away with it completely, I guess mainly because they are popular and fantastic musicians. And I'm torn. I love them as a music lover, but I am also a woman and it's just one of those things that sucks. What I do is I just tell myself: Not yet I guess. Personally, I really wish I could get over the "bitch" part and the wonderful story about how this terrible gold digging woman is being a total whore, but I can't. I should add I totally get the classic feel they are going for, and this might include lyrics, but there is a reason we are (hopefully) leaving "this horrible whore woman broke my poor heart while I am an angel" songs behind. Some "classic" elements are not worth keeping.
hhhh this **** got me pay hhh
MAJA AA GAYI BE
Love Bruno Mars... Philippine Pride :)
Better do like me never get married or get any kids, and also never drink or do any drugs, because if you drink or do drugs you don't know what you are doing because you will be high on drugs or drunk off beer, alcohol or liquor, also live rent free alone by getting your own place, skip the club's in place of working out 💪🏋at home because club's and bars, take your money too, never let a woman body control you treat it as an addict, don't fall in love, be cheap to yourself and save your money 💲💰 cook your own food skip the restaurant, and if you do go to a restaurant go alone, because no one's can control you with that kind of lifestyle only GOD can control you not people in this world, 😃
Is it ONLY Me but they are Hilarious when he was on the floor then popped up Chile that slide in when the hook it being sung I cannot stopped smiling - Love me Some Bruno!!!!! Yes :)
This is good New School musice
Silk Jackson5 Sonic

Smoking out the window 🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love it. This video song. Everything in it.
These lyrics are smooth 🎶🎶
I can’t get over this song.  The harmonies and grooves are so tasty.  I didn’t grow up with this sort of soul music at all, so I feel like I’m discovering a whole new world.  Maybe I should check out the Temptations or something like that.  I’d love to hear more pop music sound something like this, even if it’s not as blatant of a throwback.
This song never gets old💯💯❤
This Is AMAZING Collab with SILK SONIC but When i listen to spotify it has a Explicit music Tag i didn't know this music is so Amazing when you throwback into 80s and 90s songs   BTW this is Legend
This is the most  fancy "she belongs to the streets" I've ever seen
Enjoying this at 1:25 speedos
bruno bringing back them 80's style with a lil bit of his own touch
I'm still laughing  how he just layed on the floor like that and camera flipped to him lmao
How absurd!
🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
me: I don't have road rage. I am super calm on the road me every 2 seconds: 0:32
Damn. That's a good song. Fucking hilarious and them boys can SING... lawdt I got the vapors

Eran necesarios los cigarrillos en la mano para hacer el video? :v nomas pregunto
The magic that's missing from music videos today, this is wonderful!
Köszönöm szépen ❤️. Nagyon selymes 🎶. A fiacskám hivta fel rátok  a figyelmem. Hálás vagyok neki es nektek is. Jó egészséget kívánok 🙏
Que vibe incrível. Vocês são maravilhosos! 🤩
I love Anderson just playing dead on the ground here 😂- 1:42
I have same height as bruno and I wish I could DANCE like him.
Cursing is a sin and so is Insulting, using God's name in vain and Rude and Crude joking. Repent n turn to Jesus
God sent his one and only son to die for you cus he loved you so much. Stop sinning and praise him to show that you love him back, then you'll get to Heaven.

i can totally dance like this however you will not see any proof of that smile:)
This dude is an upper. Above legends. MJ's dummer is playing with this youngster. Makes him even more legit. I don't know... I don't believe in reincarnation at all, but if all that stuff is true, then he might have been Bruno Jackson . Or vice versa 🤔
Smoking  out window
Bruno Mars gets his inspiration from Mars 😍
Ele é demais é espetacular eu amo Bruno Mars e os rapazes também arrasam 👏👏👏👏😍😍😍😍😍 😍👏👏🌹❤️❤️❤️
How to be saved and be right with God for eternal life! 1-Admit you’re a sinner and be willing to turn from your own self righteousness to God. 2-Believe onto Jesus Christ, who  being the begotten Son of God, died on the cross, was buried and resurrected for the full forgiveness of our sins as a free gift. 3-Confess onto God,asking to be saved accepting this free gift of salvation, to start a new life being born again after being saved from your sins.  Scripture links below.

More scripture. John 3:16-17 16."For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” 17.”For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”  Romans 5:8-9 8."But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9."Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."  1 Corinthians 15:1-4, 1."Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2."By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.” 3."For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;” 4."And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”
Bruh this woulda be an A+ if they had future announcing them to the stage and him closing the theater with "now everyone back to the streets."
Does anyone else stomp their foot at the Hercules part or just me?
Mds, como eu amo esse cara, Bruno Mars o mais pika.
1:36 😂 Cool
Loved it ! 😍🤩
There is just no joy like watching someone who is just born to do what they do….it literally is so ingrained in them …it “evaporates” right out of their body and you feel it like rain…….wow…never gets old…Bruno, sing on …sing on
demais!
this song is absolute trash, i got a headache from listening to it.
I thought paak was a rapper, he can sing
Man, Will Smith should try to get a verse on this song. If he had balls, it would be fire.
This and same time is so fun,most sexiest...and so much more....

Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

BRUNOS MARS AND SILK SONIC ARE A BAD MOTHER WHAAT GROUP!💯💯💯
@ around 2:46 you see bruno go to his knees with the mic cable between his legs as the camera switches angle the cable is then outside his legs. Indicating those are two entirely seperate recordings. Idk y i notice stuff like this or feel the need to mention it but yeah
Oh Bruno baby..😍 I don't know about you ladies but the way this man moves doing something  to me.😍😍🤪
Trifling and walking barefoot 🙈🤣🙈🤣
Temptation vibe
Lol, anyone notice the other two in the band look like twins.
Watch more n more😇🎶💥✨
Such a smooth and refreshing comedy
A MASTERPIECE!!
This bitches  got me playing this shit  On repeat  Diamonds on your necks  Diamonds on your wrists And here i’am poor and alone  (Poor and alone) 😂🎵  This music is FIRE duuude , Brasil loves your music!!!

This Group is an EPICAL MASTERPIECE 💯❤️
Please do a remix of the group. Switch I CALL YOUR NAME. ONE else can do it justice. Old school R &B music. Love yall congrats on keeping R&B ALIVE  M
I envision this woman being a very vain beautiful woman if she got you spending $45K at Tiffany's. If that's the case you got what you paid for. Those 70s songs told a entire love story, tragic as it might be.
Not an all time Bruno fan, but this song absolutely kills. And the video is that much better
This another level here boy
holy shit Ninoy Aquino 1:44
🚬🪟
I showed up on this and last week I looked him up and he's been an entertainer since he's a little boy and he's got the whole package they're hot they're hot group they got it all I wish music was more like this today , because they know how to do the music and do it right let me just let me put it out there I hate hip hop and rapping I have no use for it at all I come from the Motown here in rock and roll best ERA ever and to see these guys come back and redo it it's awesome.
You left the door open 😂😂😂
Yeah I think so good last night so good💖💃🏾
1:34 laydown for real? lol
Amazing talent!
Is MICHAEL JACKSON better than bruno mars
this is beautiful
Me encanta la música de este tipo
I love this because you can tell they are having fun
This song won’t get out of my head , someone help
After 2:39 is one of the greatest moment that ever happen in music industry.
Love the 70’s vibe. So relaxing.
Every sugar daddy's anthem
Masterpiece!
If you are reading this at night, you should get some sleep, and don't stress about everything going on in the world, or what you are going through. Don't dwell on things from the past, don't stress on your future. Just live your life, because you only get one. Do whatever makes you happy, not what other people want from you. For me, I'm gonna wake up tomorrow morning, get hit the gym, and cherish life for the amazing blessing that it is. I hope you do the same and have an amazing day as well!❤Please Click My Name If You Need More Of This🙏🏼
Bootsy collins on the song for 4 seconds and sets the tone perfectly. Iconic voice.
Bruno Mars might actually get you into thinkin smokin cigarettes ain't harmful to your health lol 😆

I love this song

True soul ain't dead. Pied pier mofos. People follow beats. Not the other way round. Kwality choon.  Screaming hercules  😄😄😄
Watching this video with my dad and why is he relating and sympathizing with this song so much 😭 “dang that is messed up” on the chorus!! now he wants to listen to the whole album lol
Found this year later
This is the Mans version of im.not gone cry no mo! Lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I feel like he missed the perfect opportunity to have the lyrics say, "I thought that girl belonged to only me, but I was wroooooong, because she belongs to the streets!"
Pensa que agradável de se assistir. GRATIDÃO.
I don't remember
they are very good..
How can a song about heartbreak make me feel soooo good?!
Why men must call women b*** to express themselves???
These motherfckers 😂
tough
No joke... I'm too old for him - and I've always said that I have a height requirement - but Bruno could get it all day everyday, and twice that on Sunday lol
When anderson paak was on the floor 💀💀💀💀
Ohhh noooo
Bruno Mars simplemente lo mejor
Was her name Natalie? 😮😢🤣
Guess you won’t leave the open door 🚪 anymore 😯🤣😯
Music, Vocals, Style...Perfection!
When he says not to be dramatic but I want to die then proceeds to lay on the floor during Bruno's next verse I laughed so hard LOL 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I just love Bruno Mars
this lyric hits right where a man tries to bury its thoughts♥💔
These are my babies , too especially Bruno
Just the other night she was grippin on me tight screamin HERCULES!!! 😩😩😩😂😂
it's 1:44 of this jam and I found Andy on the floor
So basically it's the she belongs to the street meme turned into a song
Bruno give 90s vibe.
I crack up every time Paak dies and remains dead they the camera pans out.
Flavor with silky smooth sauce!!! Pimp problems lol!!!!
☺️❤️✨✨
Perfeito deus abencoe

This world wouldn't be sh*† if we didn't have Bruno
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Funniest band on the planet 😂😂
"This.. b*tch.. got me payin' the rent, payin' for trips." 🤣
Kanye:

Bruno ain't no simp no moo Cityboys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes I  like Andersen too.
I literally love all your song you are wonderful you are so good
Ahhh I love this song smoking out the window
Si Señor..tienes mucha clase.🌈

This guy is simple genious! Brings back the classic perfectionism.
This is turning into a classic
Only thing missing is NATE DOGG. Andersons .Pakks track, bt Dre gave a cpl pointers on this as in co produced, I hear his tagline. Theres a big difference between him and his students using his style, u can hear it. The closest student to mimic his style was Scott Story and Scott ain't close to Dre. U can tell when he's  hands on involved.
I love it.
This is how it was done back 50 years ago. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I feel as if my spirit was waiting for this music. Thank you Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak. If you only knew how much your music means right now.
Génial
❤️❤️❤️
Sounds like a sugar daddy lol. Props to Bruno mars bringing this sound back
🔥🔥🔥
She was with me last night
This is exactly the music we need in these difficult times.  Something that makes you feel good....
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This song makes me want to start smoking cigarettes
Mac would be how far paak has come. He always saw his talent, good to see people like thundercat and paak getting their recognition for the Musial genius’s they are.
The 1980 vibes are on fire right now! so good!
this song sucks compared to Hey Ya by Outkast
I know but I luv it Alright 👍
Eeey! Hope you could see WYAT by SB19 worth watching! 💙💠
Anderson is the David ruffin of silk sonic it's the showmanship and pure charisma
Lindissima  música
they left the door open for the wrong one
My 2 year old grand baby loves this song. Immediately calms him if he’s having a tantrum over whatever he feels like having a tantrum about on any giving day lol!
Wait a minute, this love started out so timid and so sweet But now she got me (smokin' out the window)  Must've spent thirty-five, forty-five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E Cheese Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin': How could she do this to me?

https://youtu.be/j5uAR9w7LBg  KweenNicki-Super Freaky Girl video.💋💄

133
is this the guy from fortnite
The not to be dramatic but I wanna die, and he falls out kills me every damn time. Then Bruno just vibes right over him laying there.... then BAM!!!!! He pops back up like a jack n the box.
1:28 iconic part
Two of the smoothest funniest entertainers of this generation. A collaboration made in heaven. Unbelievable throwback sound so smooth.
- Thought at first they were gonna break into 'Dick In A Box'.
Fantastic!!
Got Damn these Gentlemen look clean as fuck 😎
Rest in peace Anderson .Paak , he´ll definately not stand up again in 3 seconds
Old school always works for him♥️♥️
Oh wow, the harmony and synchronization  is amazing!  Pure art and the epitome of smoothness . Love them!
Bringing back old Motown sounds! Classic never goes out of style!
What kind of Cigarettes are those?🤣🤣🤣😜🤪😝

Let's keep the 70's theme going lol Dale Manny money Gonzalez ✌ 💰 🤑 💸 🤣 🙌 ✌ 👑♈🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺🇺🇲🇺🇲🎧🎚🎛🔈🔊🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵😎😎🌬🔥🔥🔥🔥🕺💃💃💃💃💃💃
This might be my favorite video since MTV actually played videos.
Message in the song is contemporary yet they got a temptation/ Motown 70's vibe.
This colab is One of the most well succeeded colabs in History of colabs
Everytime i play this there are no ads hahhhahahahh lol but i love it the way they collab<3
https://youtu.be/pdnOgKqKJUs hier der neueste Song von Bruno Mars
🖤🖤💜💜
🖤🖤💜💜
These guys give that old school vibe.
they bought mics with wires... that is another level
When I hate 90% modern pop artists Bruno Mars and gang always come up with something that makes my day brighter. :) Well done all.
they don't need to use the word bitch to get cred..
This funny.  That foo dead lol hahahah
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good music is still alive
This man does not have even one bad song
IPIPIPIPIPIPIPI
Who else feels like living in the 80's?😅 This is so cool!😉👍
Wow😲🤩, I am a vinyl collector and did not know that such a collaboration was taking place. I love two artists but I haven't heard this album. YouTube helped me with this. Great production and BIG arrangement !!! UP !!!
Gefällt mir und gefällt mir
He went thur this bitch got me smoking  out the window lol
Hes smooth
I really only thought Bruno was in this song. That good of a combo
OS😍😍😍😍😍
Get me an extinguisher wow hot hot hot
My kids got me to listen to this i like it. The foot work .is so 70s
These men are legend
We’ve all dated at least one
Bruno Mars I love your  shit hey Anderson Paak I love this song saying this Bitch  got me pay the rent  pay the  trips  diamonds on my neck diamonds on my wrist keep saying the B word.
They never disappoint 🤌🏾
love it
No song ever had me jamming and laughing at the same damn time! LOL
1:45  😅
Yes, all the Silk Sonic music videos have absolutely incredible music but no one wants to talk about how funny they are. Anderson Paak popping in frame from the side just to perfectly deliver "This bitch" ??? Him whipping around to the camera to ask if that's what we like in Leave the Door Open??? Incredible.
This album is fabulous. Imagine this song back on Soul Train. 😏
This 70's Soul Train vibe is EPIC!
The Funk in this so smooth..👌
My favorite song of 2022. Period.
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

(How could she do this to me?)

Vote for Silk Sonic on mtv story!!
That "I wanna die" is priceless...
That's how you can call out a sorry no good woman and get away with it by singing it in music I love it.
Is it just me or Taj Gibson is in d house y'all!!
How could you? How could you do this baby?!? I definitely felt that in my soul.
Tttttyyyyythujyyyyyyy
🚪🔓👌🏾
Anderson falling then getting back up to sing gets me every single time. Smooth and delicious like no other out there. So fun and too cool!!!
Bruno!!!!!! I love it.  I'm new too his music plz forgive me.
She belongs to the streets!
I love the song I think it's hilarious how they could turn it around in a song and it's so true I love how it's going back to the 70s and I know a lot of people have made comments about the cigarettes well they smoke cigarettes in the '70s on the stage because I was a go-go dancer in the cages in the 70s wake up people that was in the 70s, and hopefully a lot of the music is coming back I wish I do some good Marvin Gaye.
I LOVE this song!👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
FENOMENALNOOO👍👍👍♥️♥️
My fav. Part "This B**** got me paying her rent..." Lol didn't know Bruno Mars talked like that 😂😜
Smooth as silk! Love their style...,
Hey man from an alien perspective, these humans are pretty cool.
I love this because of the old Timey vibes
I am 77 years of age and I know good music I appreciate their music very much they going back to the 60s and 70s and I love it I love the way they dress so so classy I'm noticing a lot of things sometimes it's good to go back, I'm getting in touch with all of your old memories LOL good or bad or indifferent would you not say.
Bruno i Love your SmokinOut Of the Window  Shit
Saw them live ! Would see them again if I get the chance 🍀 Best show ever!!!
Old School vibes
so perfect... Gänsehaut!
1:15 Anna Klump approved lyrics
How is it that Silk Sonic can combine pure brilliance with refreshing, "70's" genre music with comedic timing while smoking cigarettes????? I can't stop laughing and singing along simultaneously!!! I look forward to catching them live
Can't wait for the next album
I would say that this should be called "The Red Pill💊 Song🎶"  😂

Hey Bruno Mars why do you have an afro you are not black ur part filipino. You should promote filipino talent. Like what Jo Koy is doing he even got a movie out with an all filipino cast.

Anderson is definitely on his game here (as always)..  Bruno and the backup guys are spot-on as well... And when Bruno steps out - ... yeah ...  The fact that the guys are bringing this along with a  badass (REAL) band is SO refreshing...
Bruno Mars has officially hit legendary status
Please put the singles on this album on Rock Band

I'm so glad I found and watched that video! I can't believe I wasted my money on this album. It's just a bunch of noise. Anderson, you look like a meme and your team is terrible. Mighty 😇 Travels 🤙 Premium has allowed me to travel to places I never would have been able to go without it.
;)
Awesome video!
When will the next video drop?
Can you make more videos please
Enjoyed it!
If y’all can see them in person in Vegas  then do it! Their show is everything 🔥🔥
Silk Sonic is the disco Steel Panther! Lol
The definition of musicianship.
This video will be funny forever
Put In A Jam With Her Ex From UFC... Had Me In Tears,,  Kid Running  Round  My House Like It's  CHUCKY CHEESES.. Funny As Hell.. Great Song... See You Guys In Brooklyn

How beautiful Bruno Mars
Man. Bruno Mars is the only secular musician I would go and see live in concert.

How did they get it to look so smooth at 30 fps?
I like the song leave the door open that's my favorite song in the world of all time
This song is on it way to billion
I absolutely love the 70s and the 80s music. Especially funk, soul, disco, post-disco, post-funk, synthpop, Hi-NRG, new wave, dance-rock, dance-pop etc... If any of the current musicians could bring back those genres, Bruno Mars has gotta be one of them. Love his every album.
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (that girl there, she belong to everybody), ooh Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass Is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out! Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (ooh, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody), ooh
The point of the song: SHE BELONGS TO THE STREETS!
Beautiful harmonious voices Rythmn n sound nwords..
Back to the 70s. Real music and great performance.  I love it!
Pop perfection.
The Album is a complete success, because of it i’m listenin to old blues and jazz songs, soul…it brings us back to the old good times !
SilkSonicのオリジナルの美しい歌声と合唱のハーモニーと優雅でエレガントな踊りのダンスを披露してくださいましてほんとうにありがとうございます。

Anderson just dies in this video lol Love the song, Silk Sonic!

Life is an eternal learning. We'll never know everything, because every day, we have a new experience, But we always learn something new...  It's time for us to move on. We've come a long way, really. we passed through streets, towns, cities. We pass from obstacles that we thought were impossible, but we managed...  We did it, because together we can do everything, and apart, we can't do anything. Maybe one day we won't talk to each other anymore. Maybe at some point, we won't miss it...  But there will be that day, that we will want to go back in time, and there will be that moment, that we will cry. Crying for longing, the drug of longing...  But then, let's remember, that first day From that first gift... From that first ride, and let's think: - We achieved...  And it won't be life that will tear us apart. For it was life, that made us meet...  Show!... An Excellent Video and A Beautiful Music. Beautiful Edition. Congratulations. A Nice Post. It cost!... Big hug. Beautiful Afternoon and a Beautiful Beginning of the Week... (H.R.)💯🌴🍀☘🌵
This song is fire, feels like something from the temptations era, 100% platinum

DEIDRA TANDY ROSS SWEET HOME ALABAMA
Feel like watching JACKSON 5 in pandemic era😊
This song never gets old 💕
Don't ever recall seeing a music video with cigarettes before, lol!
it's funny that this song just seems so personally made for anderson paak, especially the gravity of emotions he showed singing 'this bitch got me paying her rents..." got me nodding my head in sympathy - like i can relate/see him all emotionally broken up over this personal experience. whereas bruno mars singing the same part just sounds like hes trying to support his friend HAHA.
It’s so refreshing to have artists like Bruno and Anderson being this popular.
bruno, what a fucking sexy creature.
🤍
love this music
I feel like om watchin the O Jay's
The pimping been hurt! ! LoL!
Yesssss ! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How they switch parts is so cool cause of their different bad ass voices. It’s so funny. The verses are so dope and the chorus is amazing..song is a 10

1:16 와...... 음악이 너무 좋아서 입 벌어지는거 진짜 오랫만이네
Johnny Depps’ song for Amber Heard
Awesome Song nice
Anderson carries this song
Their dance step is too darn sexy! 😍 Loving Bruno Mars...😍
Anderson is a Full blown FOOL🤣🤣🤣🤣
charles oliveira and yoel romero singing together
Why did they even left the door when there is the window to smoke out LMAO
Sooooo I guess we not catching grenades no more….where have I been lol 😂
Hits different when u smoking in a car
We need smokin yeah
No offence but if I spent bout 35-45 thousand up in Tiffany's I definitely wouldn't be smoking out the window..... fuck the batch and smoke wherever
They jamming they ass off!!😂💃🏿💃🏿
.Paak on the floor 😂 I’m done!
💜💜💜
yes
1:16 gah damn
amoooo
lyrics make me laugh! music make me swoon
These guys are awesome
1:47   Me after one shot at the my friends party
This song is a little too good for music today.
Michael:hee hee Bruno:whoo whoo Still love the song evesince I heard it I learned all the lyrics in 10 minutes
omg smashing it
Just good music 🤎
Bruno. Mars. You're. Awesome. My. Handsome. Lil. Brother. Soooooooo. Prouddddd. Offfffff. Youuuuuuu. Bruno. Mars. Loveeeeeeee. Itttttttttttttt. TASHI. Hale
Man this song has been stuck in my head for almost a month at this point! Its amazing. Thank you, Silk Sonic and everyone who worked on this!
She belongs to the streets!
Bruno mars wants to be black so bad 😂
The most classy way to say "She belongs to the streets"
I feel like I'm responsible for at least 50,000,000 of these views
I like that song is Bruno Mars
I wonder if this song is something Johnny Depp is playing
He left the door open to be smoking out the window.
This song takes me back to the Defonics, great harmony, falsetto, and temptation like moves for the whole package.  Love it!
Tente achar uma música do Bruno ruim, e falhe miseravelmente 🤏🏼♥️
I'm not that good at English but reading lyrics had me dying by my own laughter 😂😂😂
I can't 🤣 paak died and came back to life
I remember early last year I went through this. But I guess I am just a sucker like alot of people would call it. There are other names people will call it. Something like simp, weak minded and others I cant think of. Y'all are right, but some of us dont have the success stories. Glad there are songs to represent what some of us go through. Jay Z might have "99 problems, but a bitch ain't one". However some of us have all the problems; 100% of the problems. And I know there will be people telling me "it's your fault" or "grow up", but they are not in my shoes or someone like me. This song along with alot of Bruno's hits speak volumes to me and my troubles
After leave the door open
Bruno has an old soul....wow I love it
SMOKIN!!!!!!!
this hits so hard omg
make more video
The Rapture  For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and those who died in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. 1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events. Like the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life. I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live. Deuteronomy 30:19 R.M  WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS ​​AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?
1:36 the funniest scene 🤣🤣
와우.... 미친새끼들 너무잘해 ㅠㅠ
Man's went fro catching grenades for her to straight up regretting his life choices
Selina-Mae Hopkins-Birsen Badgasse 5ORT Langenau Germany
This song is so damn good.

An amazing group of talented men. I just hate the fact that women are being referenced to as a bitch.
The funny uncle energy in this is so strong 😂😂😂
Great Groove ! Great Sound!
Почему музыканты без сигарет?
Omg...this just got on my feed! I AM DYING I've been missing out for 7 months? Loving the 70s throwback too
so fucking fun
Love, love it! Beautiful!  So talented 👏🥰
Y'all are stupid. They brought back an entire classic genre.
💥⚘👅⚘💥😱
"Look here baby, I hope you find whatever it is that you need, but I also hope that your trifling ass is walking barefoot in these streets" are the best two verses I've heard to date from a pop song.
Brilliant writing!  And the Things guys go through with the Kids running through his House like it’s Chucky Cheese to Her X being a UFC fighter.  He spent his time, money, & he was dissed!  After he spent 45K?!   That’s total DISBELIEF!  The funny part!  They never inhale the SMOKE! 💨 The story Proofs that we do things to make people happy!   A lot of guys like to spend Money 💰.  It’s sad to see Women do THIS!  #GoldDigger
Next Micheal Jackson?
I‘m not a huge fan of Bruno Mars, but this song is stuck to my head since I heard it somewhere on Instagram. :D
Not that’s entertainment!!!
Really great music by you guys. Team work makes dreams work. 🎼💯🎼💯
He said this B.... Got me paying the rent...WOW!... LMMFAO!
Perfect show everrrr! You never disappoint us!!
Mood! Narcs inspired this song
Love this collaboration of these two guys😎
Love this collaboration of these two guys😎

🤔🤔Dios es amor? Número 7?
I like Bruno’s music style, man. Classic sound.
I bet you regret the lyrics in the song grenade huh 😂”I’d catch a grenade for ya”
Hahaha the live chat is blowing
La calidad se consigue con la pasión, la excelencia, el carisma, el respeto, el amor, el humor, y el buen gusto. Una obra de arte que atrae y conquista como un astro. 😘
this is the sassy 70s version of Golddigger
Truly the best song of 2022. I can't tell ya how many times I've jammed this smoking ganja out the window.
Insane throwback into the good old times. Thank you Bruno Mars & co for this wonderful peace of music! 🥰🤩
Yes
Wonder what the old heads think about this.
I love everything about this!!❤
Like it's Chuckie Cheeeeese!!!
So no more grenade catching for Bruno?
Bruno again has added to the list of not failing
Why they seem like a boy band? 😂
Gm FAM....TAKE CARE OF THE STRIPPERS, THEY ARE BABY MAMA S👶 ...FIRST IN LINE. OMEGAS WEAR YOUR CONDOMS THIS CLAVE WEEKEND...HI RICKY, DEREK, JACK, JOE, KIMA, ADAM, DARON, ...MY FAVES..WHO LET THEM DOGS OUT?!?!?!
My ish that have me hollering is when Bruno says Bruno Mars says play I'm laughing and talking to taking coffee so hold on I'm laughing no with Bruno says get them bad ass kids running around my house like it's Chuck E cheese I fell out of my car when I first heard it OMG
Smoke Out The Window, Leave the Door Open, Versace on the floor.  More of these and the next compilation will feature a House.
Anderson on the floor was pure gold.Anderson popping back into the camera on beat was PLATINUM!!😂😂
this is goddam clllllrazy man
yoel romero?
It is just so so entertaining watching you guys. You are the guys to watch 🤓
I Relly enjoy this this song Very good
💕
Dare I say this...... Gulp... Best music I've ever heard? Maybe. And I've heard some great shit I love deep into my soul. But my soul can't take this, it's too good, Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Proof this old style was the best. To me anyway
When Anderson comes in with the "this bitch..." 🤣🤣🤣💪🏿
Why did Silk Sonic leave the door open in the first place?
Who is here after Cinema Sins critiqued this video?
SkSc is the only group who would even be allowed to do a parody of their own songs.  And I'm willing to bet the parodies would sell as successfully as their original hits lol
I just love this video cause of the tall guy on the left, he is hitting his shit
I DON'T THINK I WILL GET OVER THIS SONG NOT ANYTIME SOON. I JUST CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT.!!!

Great song great job i wish i could hi five you because you have evolved so much
Te odio por si lo ves :'((((((((((
Very entertaining
I am not hating on them because I love Bruno and I really get it,but the 70's was the worst fashion decade ever.This has already been done and it's getting boring.

keeping R&B MUSIC ALIVE
Hi Nina 🌹
1:36 “THIS BITCH” 💀✋
Love these young men  and all of their music
Honestly never seen a lead singer go back up honestly I love how they all equally partake and take some of the front line.. Bruno Mars is an exceptional man
these two complement each other’s music 🎶 well
Love you bruno
Chuck-E-Cheese
Casually hits blunt after hitting a perfect note
why does this make such a good christmas song
I have never liked videos calling women B' s  but this song is off the rails.  I've fallen in love with this song and group. Wow just Wow!!!!
This is like a modern classic ... it's so good.
te amo brunito
aneveningwithsilksonic
This. Is. Perfection!!!
This music perfect
You are my world.
I’m 66 yrs old and love these guy’s 💯💕🔥
She belongs to everybody.
Esta bueno
Yooooo...best ever but it happens lolol
goes with. ..
Woman does stuff to us, i really like song/video.
Hercules Hercules...
Love it 🥰
they’re fucking funny😭
Anyone notice how similar these visuals are to Treasure
Smoking 🚬 out the window of the benzo, the benzoo...😪
He said Chuckie cheese hahaha
He wanted to leave the door open then she got him smokin out the window now he’s trying to put on a smile
Anderson would be perfect in a Christmas song
Special thanks for the humor in the performances and videos!!!
BTS can't do it like that. nope.
Smoooth !
Hey you, yes you who is watching this, I'm asking you,  Ever wondered Why there's so much suffering in this world? And Why do we die?  Suffering is because of Sin, once sin is 🔪 suffering will also be 🔪 This is the proof of sin in each one of us, check yourself out: Ever Lied? Ever Disrespected Parents? Ever Got angry on people?(anger=murder) Ever Stolen? Ever Lusted after someone?(lust=adultery)  Because Everyone has sinned against God and became worthy of death(☆Rom 6:23) but God being a Loving Father sent His only beloved Son for us on the Cross✝️ to be Sacrificed as a ransom for our sins(We committed crime,  Jesus paid fine ☆John 3:16). And now whoever believes and accepts Jesus as his Lord and Saviour, he/she is granted freedom from sin, Everlasting life, peace✌, love❤ and joy😊 and a relationship with the Eternal God. (☆Acts 3:19)
My broke ass keeps telling me I shouldn't be listening to this it sounds too expensive
Chuck E Cheese ..expression gold ... i love this song
The drop dead on the floor choreo is GOLD 😂💕💕💕💃💃✨✨😂
오빠 사랑해요!
Feels like I’m watching the temptations tell me how “my girl” turned into how could you girl. Saw Bruno live in 2011 before uptown funk blow up and this might be some of his best work.
😀
this is what music is suppose to be. best collab in the industry.
charlie wilson vibes
👍👍👍❤️
he my favorite singer😘😘😘😘😘😘💋
This is such a great Mutha Funkin music video. 👍
Another reason I ❤ Bruno.
Woooh..i looooove it!!!
Anderson was the best thing to ever happen to Bruno and vice versa. They’re insanely talented apart and pure magic together! Love the comedy too!😂
Smooth as silk!! Fallin in love !🤩😍 💗 💗💗
First time seeing or hearing of Anderson and silc sonic, I hope they all keep making songs together because this is just fuckin fire 🔥🔥🔥
The Rmx is better ngl
Him on the floor has me in tears
Oh no!!! This bit……. 🤣🤣🤣 in tears I love it!!!
Would've NEVER thought they would've brought that old-school feeling on their joint project! I'm loving it!
🥰🥰🥰
this song is fire 🔥
It’s so entertaining to watch over & over again. Love the way it comes a cross their all having a fun 🤗 & let’s not forget all that talent 🤩🎶.
Anderson, as he is a good artist, has the face of a meme, and the team is also very good. Congratulations brothers... Good album
Papai Michael esta orgulhoso.
This goes perfectly with situation where you're at the bar drinking a lot and just bitching about your ex
Eu amo Bruno Mars ❤
The best way of saying "she belongs to the streets"
This song is fantastic and cracks me up
Love Bruno as an artist...However, the B_ _ ch word was so tasteless that I could not finish listening to the song.
No need for the “B-word”, Bruno & sidekick. There’s too much misogyny in the world without you adding to it. Dislike. 🤦🏼‍♀️
I say yet again, I am in Kenya, please come love. I love you!
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die" like if this ain't the biggest mood
Why he pop back up like that, I cant
The song has me singing, the video has me laughing, and Bruno Mars is fine as always
Q
Book,  and wowum
We are all huge supporters of their talents.  However since the fan base is mostly females, the "This B.... could have been substituted for: "This Chick got me.....".  Or even "This Trick"..... better than B......... It would open up the market.  The dance moves are on-point, the harmonies are tight (as usual) and the timing is impecable.  Stay together and continue building your Silk Sonic Power.
Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die.
When he went 2:44  I felt that in my soul
:)
Esa rola esta buena la fumar:)
Esa A😊
Papu:)
Bruno marsssss :)
Gotta be honest... incredible song and video. Old school, new feel. Not my genre, don't typically listen to pop or top 40 anything these days but keep up the soul!
Marvelous!
amazing
This is good 🙂 Love the vibes and appreciate the performance !
This song so smooth it reminds me of the 70s.
Not to be dramatic ☺️😂😂😂
No matter where I'm at, everybody gotta shut up so I can do my verse at 1:16 😂🔥🔥💯

"She belongs to everybody"  Basically Bruno sayin she belongs to the streets.
This was EVERYTHING!!
No i was socialising

Andy playing dead then popping up right on the back beat is the best thing I’ve ever seen.

Bruno looks like the guy that does "pen pineapple apple pen" 🤦‍♀️  My kids pointed this out and now I can't unsee this🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ They thought he dropped a new album.
I should not leave that door open.

Lol I’m a surfer kid punker but nothing I mean nothing beats 70s soul my boy just sent me this I liked Bruno Mars already but him and his boys killed that, stoked to hear them doin some soul, wish that music was still here! But I’ll settle for Bruno and his boys! Great tune!
THIS IS WHAT MICHAEL B. JORDAN SAID ABOUT LORI, H.... AFTER THE BREAK UP HE STATED HE HAD TO GIVE HER BACK TO THE STREETS.....

#1 Album
The Weeknd is still better.
0:31 Every guy has at least one woman in mind when he hears this.
When he say this  bitch he been wanting to say that for awhile 🤣
Romans 10:9 Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
0:32 and 1:36 hit so hard
The song that Jhonny Depp dedicate to Amber Heard.....excellent choices.....lol
Simpin out the window.
I had to watch this over and over. This was so creative.  And Paak had mean dying. Y'all sing that thing but on otherside  I'm laughing like a SNL skit. This was hilarious yet top notch singing. Paak went Oran Juice Jones on us. Classic. Somehow can't escape this idea  was probably Paak all the theatrics. I love his voice too
It the part when he laying on the floor for me 😂😂😂😂
This may be the best damn song ever 🤣🤣
It’s the playing dead and then come’s out of nowhere and starts singing again for me 😂😂.
The song is nice cute funny. But, they could have left the word Bitch out I see why the radio plays the song and skip the word out. Even though its just a song. It's still disrespectful to women
How do i explain this is above a masterpiece ❤️❤️❤️
Love it!😂
1:45 dead body reported
Bruno Mars é incrivel esse estilo do clip é foda demais
Did they intend to be this funny🤣🤣🤣🤣
They still have the day after pill so all is not lose . Safe sex my god be with us.😇😇😇😇😇🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🤔🤔🤔
Just imagine these guys headlining glastonbury, jeepers
Missed their chance to say 'she belongs to the streets'😭
See what happens when you leave the door open.
Never new he made this song. This is a amazing song-
Bruno finally dropped the grenade 💥
My man got this as his ringtone… and I got questions 😆😂🤣
Delicia... Soul music 💖
If it's got to the point where Bruno Mars is no longer singing loves song then love is dead 1:37
Superstar more than 💯 do you agree?
I LOVE that James Ingram-type "hooooooo!" at 2:44. Best song of the decade so far.
I'm so happy class is on its way back 😭❤️ about time soul made its way back to the charts!
Love the concept.
this is music!
Love  this, fire looooooove, Sing.!!!!!!!!!!!
0:32 thank me later
Silk Sonic if they were the musical guest on The Eric Andre Show
Bruno needs a time machine
Never read the comments. This isn't comedy, this is soul.
This is art
They all holding cool 100
This that shit
사랑해요 연예가중계
"SHE BELONGS TO THE STREETS" 😂❤🔥🎵
Whos here after seeing a reel of this song?
Imagine how dope it would be if Chris Brown, and Lloyd joined the group and remade Secrete Garden
1:33
No more leaving the door open bruno going to slam and locked the damn door
They ain’t gonna catch the gernade they now gonna throw the damn gernade at cha
Jesus Christ can you from depression do what my name says and you will enter Gods kingdom of heaven and you will be happy
Accept Jesus as your lord and savior and you will enter Gods kingdom of heaven
Follow Jesus Christ
i love silk sonic😍
This song is just awesome
Donnell Rawlings singing this is the funniest thing 🤣
Is this the anthem for simps?
PERFECT! PURE TALENT!
Now its "somebody help me please". That's what happens Bruno when you "Leave the Door Open".
The pan shot to paak on the floor, had me wheeze so hard I saw stars. This entire video was too mmmuucchh 😂😂😂
Oh ok.
I love them!!!!
This shit still groovy
2:02

Bruno Mars has revealed his true form. yes please.
R&B music is on the shoulders of these men of quality musicianship whose up next to create great feel good Sounds? By the way smoking out the window this song is slapping and hilarious.
THIS IS SO FREAKING BRILLIANT. I LOVE SILK SONIC AND EACH INDIVIDUAL ARTIST ! Lol I have watched this so many times. I love their energy together. I can't stop laughing and being amazed by this video. This should have a billion views. Bruno with the cigarette and Anderson fainting is priceless.
freakin masterpiece man
So good they got me missing a time from before I was even born
He is a dream!
This B**tch got me paying her rent, paying for trips, diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist... and here I am all alone. Pure poetry. LOL!!!!
I love Silk Sonic!I'm a 64 year old fan. Even though I have ms Silk Sonic songs make me move which is a good thing. I wish I could afford to go to Vegas where they are now or will be.Come to Louisville soon😂
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more elegant and stylish way to talk about a bitch
Kellie Elia Castillo is I qalmartwith my oma.grab a pair of ducks because she loves me and I hope that you are okay black haired brandy. Give up your gun Jason Winston. And you can make  up your own stories about how you wished I would die by a gun. Navy seal. Good bye God bless America. And thank you chris from pappadeaux. You need help with bone marrow treatment too.
Crystal Nixon questions ?
This video is hilarious 🤣. I love this group. Bruno, Paak are Silk Sonic, and my modern day Temptations.  Soullllllful
Temón
Best 'red pill' and MGTOW song
Anybody here from the fucn around comedy special?
I love your song but you can leave out the word this bitch
Bruno and Anderson have redefined soul for the modern age. Trifling b*tches everywhere gettin put on blast...
This shit is comedy and a vibe like the music video and and visuals is absolutely perfect with the song
Just an excellent melodic single. Silk Sonic; Bruno Mars and Anderson Pack killed this Track. Bruno Mars to me is currently the best Rhythm and Blues artist!
Something Depp needs to dedicate to someone...
Won't be saying bitch when you have COPD. Ha ha ha ha! Great song!
I love how they are so cool. And comical during the songs. Beautifully entertaining and all amazing
💙this fireeeeeeeee
Bruno Mars went from catching grenades for ya to throwing their shit back!😂

Best song..omg!!!
The choreography on this is magical.  I mean so simple, yet the transitions are so smooth and the cigarette work is fantastic.  Then the camera work is just beautiful.  Love this song.

Love, love
Grazie
Bellissimo
Nice music
Paak is a whole fool for Layin of the floor playing dead 😭😭😭😭
back up singers are dope too❤
Saw them in Vegas, their a must see!
I feel bad for anybody that didn't see this video of Andrew fall to the floor like that. Really makes you feel your soul laughing and feeling the lyrics same time.
One of my friends  tell me that he met bruno mars in radio show in France and bruno want to go to the toilets well after he .... poops the smell was strong from there !! everybody runs out loool well it's true I swear !! If the media was there they published the scene well it's over for him the reputation is gone !
This bitch got me paying for trips diamonds on her rists diamonds on her neck
They are such performers as well as singers, they need a running show, not just concerts. This is classic, their performances are worth of Broadway and Las Vegas as entertainment, their chemistry has a lot to offer and they just begun...
Singing about smoking yet not one of them takes a actual drag of the cig lmfao  Great song though
😘
Hahaha

Now I can see a ladies group, (dressed back in the day like them) singing a reversal of this song, because you know how a lot of women take men into their homes.  "This - Bastard got me paying the rent, paying for tips, paying for the heat, Jordans on his feet"  Lol!!  I love Silk Sonic
Best entire album I have heard in quite a long time. Every song is hot!

I come back monthly to see Anderson .Paak flick that cigarette on beat. 🚬🥁🎶 #HeTooColdWitIt
Like Temptations harmony and dance moves combined with the best comedy parody lyrics that mimic a pop song. All taken to about 12 levels above what anybody has done before
sensacional......BlackMusic is Life

I can so imagine Johnny Depp listening to this song at one point in time. Somehow I don't think it will be last time, either.
Haha. They slipped the "Hercules Hercules" in there. Love it.
I don't understand this video.   What do you mean and how many children do you hsve with caban? How many other children do you have to speak of?   JEEZ
At least you could afford to smoke out the window in a Benz and still afford her, lol
SAW THE SHOW SUNDAY IN VEGAS!!! ABSOLUTE BRILLIANCE!!!  They are MAGIC TOGETHER!!!!! THE BAND AND BACKGROUND SINGERS …. BRILLIANT!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥💨💨💨💨💯
Came here after Amber Heard was found guilty
Another Killer Track! Midas Touch!
Fantastic tallent👌
I love this band and Bruno. This shit is hella funny!(my wife and I laughing like crazy)
Amo essas músicas deles, essas  são músicas pra nossos ouvidos, lindo álbum, quero eles no Brasil...
Cool
Why it took me this long to see this music video!? LOL why is that other guy on the floor!!!?? 🤣🤣🤣 This is a great vibe for the 60s/70s music but modern. 😍 I will listen to the album now. 😌
Killer choreography and classic melody!  Pete Woodroffe Music
Is it me only but this song kind of reminds me of  a Justin Timberlake song
Lmfaooo🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Got these kids running around my house like it Chuck Cheese
Bruno carries so much swag.
Classy, funky, smooth !!
I'm thinking how much cigarette 🚬 had used to make this one video
Bro this album keeping me going in life dude❤️ idk why I’m obsessed with Anderson and Bruno together! And these two are helping me get by dude I love these two! I hope good things get to them
I fukin love this video !! My new shit !!
love that they bring back that Motown, Groove, Funk thing.It's so dope. As well as a tribute. I don't think anyone could do it better
1:33 I wanna die 😭
Thank Bootsy Collins
They are so smooth,  the moves, swag - they got it all
Greatest singer of of all. Time
This is crap
never get bored of it
Paak and Bruno is a great collaboration. I hope that the duo do more together.
This is some of the DOPEST music ever ! I hope this band makes many many more albums!
Actually, this song causes me to burst out in laughter.  Anderson's spiel as he's taking a drag on his cigarette is classic.
I remember what this is. I do believe that this is called music. and if I'm not mistaken you actually need to have Talent to do this sort of stuff. Ya can't just mumble and use maximum auto tune with minimal lyrics ! That's not music. This is Music like the days of Motown! 💌
Bruno killedddd it at the beginning 🤣🤣🤣
Kanye probably listen this song a lot lol
thank you guys for bringing this kinda sound back. Love it !!!
1:36 good part to me
All of you haters only liked grenade and that’s it. This is REAL MUSIC THEY PUTTING OUT!!! Anderson really got his fire 🔥 going with Bruno
Is this a response to doja's song "Ain't sh¡t" 🧐
Silk Sonic smoke purple that's that chronic their music sounds good.. You don't want to stop it. 2022 May 29th
Group sounds like debarge
Suena idéntico que la canción que epico
Anderson Paak is a sexy MTF and Funny 🤣 Love my Bruno Baby Boy.💗
1:36 good part to me
Excellent, Creative, Entertaining, Amazing Performance - Thank Y'all, this is GREAT.  This is the type of Rhythm we needed to bring back & songs we can sing along with.
Get up pee wee!😆
🔥 🔥 🔥
I like this song a lot it’s so cool they’re so cool because they’re only one because they’re saying because they were there only one in number🤩
Lol a mood:
Every time I watch ..I love ❤️ Anderson Pa.at..so cool 😎
I found out about them late but better late than never.
This is definitely one of my favorite song EVER. Bruno is ageless.
LEGENDS😱😯😯😮
Damn!!! He said give her back to the City. Atleast if she for the streets it could be this block and the next 3.😂😂😂😂😂
Tifanny's
two people with distinctive voices are a perfect match
This song is so classy, smooth, their dance is so smooth and fit with the music so well , and no one is talking about the stomp…it’s perfect  Edit: mom I’m famous
This song is lame
Man i love this guy
My main man!
Is that lebron James on the back?😂😂
Did the dude on the floor die when he said he wanted to?😂😂😂😂😂
"Baby why you doin this Why you doin this to meereen. Girrrrrrl.! " dude just summed up johnny Depp. Pak can paint a picture for sure.
"This bitcc" 😂😂😂😂 his slide in was illmatic.
Any and every guy can relate to this.
Good Group Nice Music Best steps
The Way Bruno hit that high Note 🎶 and dropped to his Knees,that was it for me🥰🥰I Jus Refell in 💕 with him,they did A Awesome Job
I'm your biggest fan even my daddy is your base and
Oh my gosh. Oh my love your songs and then my dad
Cool
01:03 ✨
I've been a Anderson Paak fan since his song with Mac, I'm so glad to seem him and Bruno together in this amazing group.
This song is just gold with Bruno and Anderson .Paak delivering in spades their duo's smooth seductive late 60's early 70's R& B sound but with the delightful twist of sometimes humorous modern lyrics about a trifling ho of a woman. Really the whole idea of the duo's style in bringing smooth irresistible retro R&B into modern times is just pure genius. Love the whole vibe of the video too as a retro performance that keeps the humor of the song such as Anderson dramatically swooning after singing " Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die " and staying on the floor to jump right up in grand performance fashion on his next part as well as the never ending prop cigarettes they keep during the whole performance. Great job guys and keep it coming because I am so down for this retro modern fusion ride.
Nice video
Moooreee Moreeeee///we need Moreee
Chunky Cheese I can’t stop laughing. Brilliant nothing less from all the group it takes a group effort and they nailed. I keep watching it.
We love yy
Anderson on the floor had my crying💀💀💀😭😭😭
Someone stated that Bruno is the "Silk" and Anderson is the "Sonic" and together they indeed make "Silk Sonic."  They both deserve the credit for what they do and what they bring to the music industry and the videos they make.  I hope that they don't ever part ways, but continue to bring that "Old School" vibe that I love so much, as that was, is, and will always be "real music" that will pass generations of time into eternity.
slalsls
wtf
She belong to everybody, it's just your turn. Stay focus gents.
Eu nunca vou cansar essa música perfeita adorei
I got the fake bruno mars at the foursquare down the street. I need a new sofa Thats why we dont talk about bruno??? Cuz coke in vegas? Tf disney?
Bruno Anderson Silk keep bussin em in the head true legends now and forever
These are some bad mutha shut my mouth. That old school flavor they are bringing to the table is a breathe of fresh air in the music industry.
Wow only just heard this 🥹🥹🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰 fantastic.
This is too funny 2🤣🤣
5 stars y'all 💕🥰🥰
молодцы.
💥👍🏽💪🏽🎶💯💥❤️👌🎶
🥰😘😚
That is a THICK, FUNKY, SMOOTH GROOVE SO 70'S
Bruno,  your collaboration with Paak has been a great success.. He's a genius in his own right.   He remains outspoken,  but with love in his heart for the audiences.    I love you,  man, with everything I am, and with every bit of my soul,  Jennefer,
I was born in 60 (do the math). These guys are pop perfection. Talent off the rails. They write actual songs, sing without excessive autotune, play instruments, dance, harmonize, and they’re hilarious. When they opened for the Grammy’s I was like, yeah - they’re opening with the REAL musicians. Chucky Cheese ref? Love it.
POV:that one kid that doesn’t watch tik tok kay flock and pop smoke trying to get sturdy

Sem dúvidas alguma que no meu casamento eu dançarei essa música no baile ❤️🥰
I'm wanting to know more about Anderson and his story. I didn't know he was a rapper as well. Very talented.
Redpill
@1:46 Anderson had me done. 💀👻
My God. They are kick ass awesome. Quality music, performance and fun. I am wowed. 😍
Johnny Depp's song
beautiful. stunning. unbelievble.
The Jackson 3!!!  Amazing ❤️❤️❤️
Love love love this song
Lyrics aside, this is the way great groups used to sound and it is still awesome and timeless!
Badass!!!
Smooth diss song.. but i wanna die
Bruno also handsome reminds me of someone
Meant soooo much passion anderson
Bruno keep smooth silky voice u also Anderson soon much passion
Can we take a moment to appreciate their Swift moves matching beats flawlessly
Today I shared this mv with my classmates and some of them thought this is a song in 1980s.In fact this is actually why I love Bruno Mars.He combine the old style and his own style   perfectly.
natural music!
Belle le mie canzoni preferite
Too funny!
Just great.
This is Johnny depp v. Amber heard trial theme song.
Bruno's going through his villain arc. I knew when I heard him singing about them gold diggers that he was fucking up. Now, look at him.
I like the kids running around the house like CHUCKY CHEESE ! 😹👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
This song is too smooth!!! Love the choreography!!! Reflects a 'Playerette'. Doc B
This an SNL skit with real singers
Nobody comes close to what these guys have achieved with this album.Their effortless ability to resurrect early 70's soul without sounding pastiche is astounding.
Bruno has a silky voice outfits dynamic like back in 60s and 70s when I was teenager steps also old school my kind dancing keep up those steps and suits
So far off.
Sabe demais
They make a great collab ugh ❤❤
So glad Anderson finally getting his recognition he deserves.
"She belong to the streets" but as a classy song
1:36 felt that
That pause moment tho
This video it's very Nice
Well this is not what I thought this song was gonna be about but it sounds good anyway
This is music ri' chea!!
this is 99999999999999999999999999999999999 time beter than bts biot
This is so great reminds me of Motown in the 60s and 70s..kinda funny too
I still can't figure out if Mars and paak are making a parody album, but if they are, it's still really really good stuff
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥ooohhhh
You aint s*** if you gotta call a woman a b****.  I love them so so much and so excited to hear what they were putting out. but come the f*** on.   I couldn't believe it they were like this b****.   Just come up with any R and B group man love songs of songs that call the woman a b**** in the 7 days Just come up with any R & B group love songs that call the woman a b**** in the 70s.
Smoothe as silk
😂yo trifling ass😂🤣
Sounds so romantic 🤣🤣🤣 She belongs to the streetssssss
🤣🤣🤣
This will be considered as THE RETRO after some generations ❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Takes me back to the good old days! They are all so talented and smooooth!
How can this be beautiful, comical, on point and magical all at once?! Absolutely genius ‼️Anderson is too funny in this one. 🤣
I understand you got your ensemble of dudes for a group... but bring it back for the solid guys. This is decivingly sad.
Eles são demais 😍
If you see me by myself jammin' to this song please  "Mine Yo Damn Business". Now ain't da time.

Johnny Depp's court theme song.
💋
Paak iz crazy as hell when he passed out.🥰🥰🥰🥰
Walk on by beat by Issac Hayes I see yall
In a battle between Bruno Mars vs The Weeknd to see who should be the next Michael Jackson. Bruno Mars is the winner. Bruno started from the bottom before The Weeknd.
These guys are so smooth. Much love
I agree c
One of the most innovative bands I've ever heard about life this music is absolutely off the damn chain
AS MUCH AS I LOVE BRUNO MARS AND THIS SONG. THE LYRICS ARE TOO DAMN FUNNY FOR ME TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. 🤣🤣🤚  IM NOT USED TO THIS BRUNO MARS,I LIKE IT 🤣🤣
So refreshing to see & hear contemporary artists channeling & capturing the original Motown sound of the 60's & 70's so perfectly!  Magic, Hopeful, & Supremely Sublime...
Anderson paak and Bruno Mars are Magic togever
"This bitch " was the moment I knew this would have endless replay value
No words 😶 😩😂😂 The way tgey sing “THIS BITCH” from they soul got me hollering 😂😂
The "She belong to the streets" song
This joint fire 🔥🔥🔥 so smooth. Gives me some old school vibes. Luv it.
Bgki
I tried to make it through today without Silk Sonic but it didn't work. I'm obsessed with this group.  They are AMAZING
He's complaining in the most beautiful possible way
When Paak comes in @0:31 🤣🤣🤣
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💖💯🎶
i listen to this song 247 evrey day.
My man actually died…. 🤣🤣
I love their song so much
my fellow youtube music video consumers. I'd like to inform you that the Anderson Paak jumpscares are at 0.32 and at 1.52 God Bless
I think Bruno could be up there with the King of Pop as he is so talented. I don’t think I have heard one of Bruno’s songs I don’t like and this collaboration is no exception.
Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

These dudes went from leaving the door open, to smoking out the window alone.. Damn lol
I feel like this definitely has temptations early years plus michael jackson genre type reinventing of good quality music scores , comedy, great lyrics and a duo that was meant to collaborate. Anderson brings bruno alive with his wide eyed wild style and big smile, i never listened to Mars until silk sonic.
I love this so much. From Bruno's opening his arms complaining about kids then staring at the camera like he is complaining to his bud to Anderson's playing dead lying on the floor... This is so good. Finally something good in music these days
I love the way Anderson Paak face looks in the beginning 😂 Then their moves are definitely 70's vibe!
Oohhh noooo! 😉
Woooooooo yes guys yes!!!! This song is amazing well done !!

Smookin at the window, i let the door open.. what next? Singing at roof #part of home
In other words, thing song suited for this line "She belongs to the streets"
ONE BADASS JAM
A song that even non-smokers become smokers
Thanks to the song, the tobacco company will sell well LOL
Awesome beautiful song 🎵 ❤
Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars they bad as hell! I love this group they did a fantastic job with. The song loves train that song was originally made by the. Funkband Confunkshun back in the 70s. They are on point!
Trying out the same style without any new kick ma get your graphs low. This is an example. Like Bruno Did all the hard work. But this song was nothing new.
Old temptations I loveit
I love how nobody is going to mind the fake body on the floor
L
Every time I think I've seen enough of Silk Sonic, I realize, no, I haven't seen nearly enough of Silk Sonic, more please ;)

❤️❤️❤️
Bro Paak is hilarious 🤣
I was dying to hear this song
# 1 on the billboards!!!!!🤘🏿 this jam is forever clean….
Bye..lol
Bit*h change become Kiech
Reminds me the Motown Songs.
I like it when Bruno Mars said she got her kids around my house like it's Chuck E cheese
I love when he said this bitch lmaoooo. Love this song
WOULD BE NICE IF TALENTED ARTIST DIDN'T HAVE TO BE VUGAR AND OR SATANIC.  THINK JESUS
perfeição ❤🇧🇷
I like everything they do...  Right up my alley!
Anderson Paak gives life to all these songs. I swear to god, he's  like the crabby patty secret formula. I love Bruno too but we're not giving Anderson Paak his due appreciation
They fools.😂😂 halfway through everybody got a cigarette.
Anderson.Paak: "don't want to sound dramatic, but I want to die" <dramatically falls to the floor>  Song continues Several seconds later camera pans down  Anderson.Paak is STILL on the ground!   That sequence REALLY got me! Starts at 1:33 They're hilarious like this in concert too!
I am not even sorry for him (according to lyrics cause he paid so much for that girl) Since such a beautiful song came out of it 🤭... (❤️)
And that’s how the first song for how cheaters belong to the streets was made😂
담배를 저렇게 빨면서 노래를 저렇게 하면 어쩌란 말이냐 ㅠ0 ㅠ
My guy anderaon paak died suring this mv.
lol
Them boys looking good with those old school vibes
I’m over 60 years old and find this collaboration between Anderson and Bruno to be a breath of fresh air! Can’t wait to hear what they do next!

Selo BRUNO MARS de qualidade ❤️✅
A perfeição existe e eu posso provar ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Love Anderson Park and bruno mars
I love the song, and I went to a just recently.
Smoking outta the damn window 😤😤😤😤😤
Escuchar a Bruno Mars y su grupo es como vivir en las nubes. Qe gusto se siente-
Damn, .Paak really died at 1:43
The Bass line is so fucking good.
Love it! I sent it to my 67 year old mother and she loved it as well. I told her it was about a "ghetto hoe breaking his heart" 😂
These streets is cray cray! Lool
O HOMI E BRABO
“Just the other night she was grippin on me Tight screaming Hercules” DAMNNNNNNNNN 🥶
Is it me or I see drake and another person ik
I'm so so happy their a group with their sanging asses! They make me happy 😁😁😁❤️❤️🙌🏾🙌🏾
ARTE!
These two are like Mac n cheese.   Peanut butter and jelly.   So smooth  such a blend of harmonic voices.   A gift!
No ano 2022 artistas como esses 2 nós levarem a tempos de manhatans, Jacksons 5, comodores e tantas outras lendas é a melhor sensação aí ouvir música de qualidade, nem tudo está perdido kkkk

I love this best song since Michael Jackson
Your Killin me 😊🥰
I love the way they sing "bitch" so smoothly😂 so nice voices 🎵
Beautiful harmonies and retro vibes ruined by street lyrics. What a waste! Should have been applied to more beautiful lyrics. Pandering to the base base.
just  go to bruno mars  / smoking  out  the  window  ?
What a lovely voice!
I find myself watching this over and over because it is just so good, and really fun to watch.  These two are entertainment GOLD.
This shit is soooo funny. Great video!!! The crazy thing is we all have done some destructive shit to ourselves when we go through a screwed up relationship.
Magnifíco, a primeira vez que ouvi essa música, me identifiquei logo com ela ,fiquei arrepiado...Bruno Mars tem excelente timbre.🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I was just telling my girls , that their music today was no good.. ... I was wrong..💯
So thats Bootsy in the intro right?
เพราะมากๆ
I love the old skool vibes in this video. They kept all the editing exactly as it would look like in the 70s.
Silk Sonic has it ALL--multiple key changes...like 'molten cheese' or 'gold'. Style and substance. Sincere enough to sweep a woman off her feet...and substance to match...this is music that's 'stuck in your head' for the next 6 hours!!  Romantic but hilarious! Their woman's cold...the guys are 'hurt' and...need help... These guys just want some sincere love! Any of you ladies want to help them out???  But mainly...when you listen... you hear Deep R & B and Romance!...it really is All that matters in life!   Ladies...could you Please help these guys???
My grandson love this song i play it all the time.he just turned 1 year old he leg move lips move
I cry when I sing to this song. He hurts just like I do and just needs to be truly loved again. Great sexy song.
Yesterday i got the license, and yeah i know it, maybe i shouldn't turn on the radio because i'm still a beginner but i was totally tempted so i heard it… : " This b!**h got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist!". And guys to be honest i felt like that b***h XD.
she learned it from a MAN
I Just this group Silky
Me fan pls and nc vid
Smart natang
You keep singing Bruno Mars
I like his music he is a legend
Pure entertainment. Everything about this is just right. Music, words, choreography, everything.
I love how Anderson gets really dramatic😂
Got some New Edition Vibe
just brilliant. Love it ;-)
Me encanta Bruno Mars pero siento que Anderson Paak brilla en esta canción.
nice project.

#JOHNNYDEPP #AMBERHEARDISALIAR #JUSTICEFORJOHNNYDEPP  This song describes Amber. "This b*itch got me paying for her rent ... for her trips ... how could she do this to me?"
Hört sich sehr gut an 👍das gefällt mir einfach super 👌bitte mache weiter so👏👏👏 vielen lieben herzlichen 💚Dafür dafür 🙏😉😎🐀✌
These boys are bad all hands down
Y’all need to stay the hell out my diary…..
Why, how, can a Bruno Mars music video appear so silky smooth.
Só eu que estou viciada nessa música 😍😍😍😍😍😍
The way Bruno slowly kneeling down got me feeling relief. And when Anderson .Paak fading himself while the rest are dancing is fire🔥. Love you Uncle Brunz and Uncle Andy.
For real, that song is both the past and the future.
I love these two together. It just makes sense😁
This song needs more promo
🔥 🔥 🔥
Where can I buy a silksonic ashtray ?
0:58 WAIT A MINUTE! IS THAT LEBRON JAMES AT THE BACK OF BRUNO MARS!?
Not to be dramatic but I wanna die 😂😂🙏🏼🙏🏼
This duo is on another level "WE ARE SO SO BLESSED ENOUGH TO WITNESS THE BEST DUO IN THE WORLD"
Always the best for me all his songs is so smooth to my hear
misogyny at its finest
Anderson on the ground, gets me every time lol
I love this song soo much as a burno mars fan I lessen too Bruno mars all the time and I love all the lyrics too!

In the bridge where paak is telling the girl off (walking barefoot in them streets) I have noticed Diana Ross ain't no mountain high enough. The ahhh ahhh ahhh part being played
Johnny depp’s theme song.
❤️
Essa amizade de bruno com jefferson não é legal, antes ele falava com a lua e agora ta fumando na janela 😂
I see myself listening to this while saying "pimpin is hard man"
This is wholesome when Anderson just says not to be dramatic and falls on the floor 😂😂😂
We all belong to everybody
i love u
James Brown used to be called " The hardest working man in show business ". That title now goes to BRUNO MARS!
My baby daddy make dance move like that I love you leron

Wonderful voice
Megan got Harry "smokin out the window"!  Saw the headline of their troubles a few months back and immediately thought about this song

Steve Perry and Bruno have the best voices ever!! No,auto tune getting naked,whatever they use? They don't need anything but a mic!!!!💯❤❤❤ Beautiful sexy men!!!
This shyt is fire but I  wouldn't expect anything less from Bruno Mars and  Anderson Paak
Tell me how I just found out about this. They bring back old school funkiness back
i cant be the only guy STILL vibin to this song on full volume:
its crazy how you can see the character development in his music from over the years.
jaksel musik
You're fabulous
As much as I love Bruno Mars, honestly Anderson Paak is killing me. That line about “I hope you’re walking barefoot out in these streets” is KILLING me. Love this whole album so much.
Shld have went "she belongs to the streets " lol
Who watching somebody else's kids, letting them treat their house like it Chucky Cheese? Ain't no dice good enough to have me like that.
Anderson: not to be dramatic also Anderson: (sprawls on the ground in a fake death swoon)

1:50 is the greatest moment ever
Bruh that B word was strong 😂😂😂
This whole album!!!!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH, Silk Sonic!!!! May your talents be blessed like this for decades to come.
perfeitos
repent and accept Jesus for he is near he will come back and those who didnt repent will go to hell .this is the good news..
Im seeing this as Anderson Paak. Ft Bruno Mars. Without Anderson it wouldve been another high pitched whine song
Qué chula está la canción y el ritmo 🎸
This song and “Did You Call Me” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through tough times. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you! 🥀🥀
bisa aja nih .Paak Tarno
I love ❤ this song 🎵  it has a smooth rhythm but the video is kind of funny 😂😂😂 what trips me out Bruno Mars looks like John Leguizamo and how they expressions are there face when they do certain verses of the song but 👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤
fortnite

King Wurld 2020 bought me here lmaooo
Could someone translate that ngibberish pls.
I can’t wait to be old singing this 🥴
Just a beautiful classic
bruno Mars is dancer
On everything he is Michael Jackdon reborn!Homie got much soul.
I love this video
Still trying to smash the thumbs up, even after I’ve already forgot my stoner azz already had!-) lolz
I love you Bruno
The showmanship in this video is absolutely off the charts.
This is Jonny Depp theme song
Bruno is kinda like the modern ( in my opinion better ) version of James Brown….
I think they make that music to smoke
this is GREAT!!!
1:43 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ리듬 타면서 듣다가 개터졋네
nice song, man
Anderson paak are talented, listen to his songs...
I feel like they're signing about Amber Heard..
알고리즘 따라 왔는데 노래 좋다  둘다 누군지 모르는데 신기하네 ㅋㅋㅋ
❤️❤️❤️❤️from 🇹🇳🇹🇳🇹🇳
Bruno done got red piled.
This is soooo good! I wanna wake up to this song and my hand holding a cup of coffee 😊🌄
Anderson popping back up as if nithing just happened..had me rolling😂😂😂
Bruno=👅😍
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib  Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh  I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mmh) But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this?

Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak, and the rest of the band better clean their cars after smoking in them.
beautiful song!
dffgh
Bruno Mars and Weeknd are probably the only western mainstream artists I listen to...I love how they use old music styles but modernize them for radioplayability...it doesn't get too repetitive and actually has a solid melody...the soul of a song...
Hermosa canción y melodía, la voz de bruno es de un nivel muy muy alto
This genre fits him so smoothly, ugh such a talent
why lebron james is back singer in this
I love listening to the song everyday. What a great song!
THIS 90'S FEELING,PLIIIZ DONT GO AWAY!!!
muy goxtoso
Bruno got me with 24k Magic... Didn't think there was someone playing such a fabulous 70's R&B nowadays too. What a martian
This is excellent. Great song, great video.
Amooo, esta canción lo es todo!

O cara é um gênio!!! Tem o dom. Artista nato. Sem apelação ou sensacionalismo.
This is my favorite song and video of 2022🔥
BRUNO MARS SHOULDNT HAVE JOINED THIS GROUP BC SILK SONIC (SUCK'S)
Lol
Bruno świetnie śpiewa i ma super styl.A poza tym jesteśmy rówieśnikami.Powodzenia Bruno.
1:32 perfection.
🤣🤣🤣
Bruno Mars is small
👏👏👏
This song sounds like it's about amber heard, and the kids are her freeloading friends living in johnny's penthouse 😆.
Bruno, Sammy Davis Jr.
Love these goat right here!!! 🐐🐐🐐 cant help commenting goat!! now that i know what goat means...
Who Else Returns Daily For THE POP UP😂
GOd DAMN Y'ALL SOUND THE SAME
I can imagine Johnny Depp listening to this song in 2022. 😂
Bruno Mars... The Definition of Young and Gifted.
Hercules - Nutty Professor Help Me Please - Pops (Wayans Bros)
This song has some Boys ii Men vibes (in addition to all the other vibes, lol). I kinda wish Bruno sung the word "wrong" as one pure note but, no, he went and Bruno Marsed it.
Bruno Mars is the best 😍
I like how he’s feeling That thing
Ahahha damned love this controversal smoking video and remember you can’t buy love men ahahahaha this album is legendary love  U guys 🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰😇😇😇😇🤩🤩🤩🤩
Thank Goodness this generation has all time classics too!!
The classiest way to call out a ho3, I love it.
So versatile
first jazz band i've seen so far :) and really smooth
savage.https://youtu.be/WPdWvnAAurg
Smooth
I love the song I listen to it every day
That puff at 0:48 directly followed by the extended "sss" in the line "smoking out the window" is just so brilliantly theatrical.
If there were a new Friday movie produced by Ice Cube, then he should definitely put Bruno Mars’s song in his movie when someone be smoking in a scene. 😅🤣
I'm completely blown away by every feature of this song! 💯💯💯 I laugh so hard. Boy laying on the floor and everything. The dancing is on point. The whole feel and atmosphere of the video. This is Great!!!
Nao consigo parar de escutar essa musica viciante ❤😍 I l❤ve Bruno Mars
Can anybody help me if I kinda,...when bruno be dancing in the background,  ..I tried to look at the other dudes to see if they were insinc, and they were, but bruno  was rocking it!. Yo!
Yall off the chang! Sho you rite!
Wow is beautiful 😻
Pero que sensualidad de bruno mars... Que rico... Bien.. Bien... Saludos desde Mexico
I’m gonna start smoking because of this
How nobody talking about the dance
Gotta love that Bootsy Collins talking intro. Like icing on the cake to this timeless cut 🎂
Bruno and Paak carrying
000pp0
ANDERSON IS ALSO MUSICAL GIFTED
Who else died laughing when they realized this ain’t no love song when you listen to the lyrics 💀💀💀
Came here after klatsch
💘
Holly shii this sooo funny and sooo good
i jam to this almost every day.
The crazy part is is that this is not comedic technically
smooth
Love Bruninho❤️😁
Smokin out the window + Material girl remix
Bruno literally the calmest pimp on earth😂😂😭😭
Whoever's responsible for this choreography >>
These boyz out here making MUSIC!!!! I felt that THIS BITCH!!!
This song is one of the rare type of modern song that I fell in love with at first listen.
J'adore 🙌😎
Amazing 👏
Gotta appreciate that they barely put the damn things in their mouths and when they do they blow the smoke right out 😂
now imagine jamie fox is added into the mix . lol i bet it is going to be even more awesome smh .
Now when my wife asks me ‘where’s the cat?’, I can’t help but go “Looking out the windowwww”
Paak put on his own show you go my man
OK>>> the first time I actually listened to the lyrics...This B>>😂😂😂
Yay
No
this couldnt be better in anyway lmao
This shit is so fly....
😆👍
The crazy part is is that this is not comedic technically, they are speaking the truth about a lot of women especially single moms who use men, while still dealing with other men on the side. They are just genius enough to make it sound comedic so single moms and other women won’t get offended by the ugly truth about SOME women, not ALL.
There a class act, ahead of there time, they hit there target…style, Grace, sensitive to the times. They brought back the music. Love it.
Lol
Jackson 5 vibes. So cool!
Just amazing my first time seeing the video 😂👌🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hi there stranger. You don't know me but I wanted to spread the good truth of Jesus Christ and I encourage that you stay and learn more❤✝️.  See God created the first of humankind and gave our first descendants dominion over the earth and things in it but we soon rebelled against God and so sin was born into the knowledge and actions of humankind. Thankfully enough we have the opportunity to rid ourselves of sin and reconcile with God the holy father through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ the son of God. He died on the cross for our sins and took the punishment we were supposed to receive, defeating sin in the process and freeing whosoever seeks salvation in him.. giving unto them a new and beautiful life with him as a born again child of God. I would love to see each and every single person on this earth receive salvation and avoid eternal damnation so I spread the good news in hopes that I can get as many people to repent and receive Christ before his second coming. The kingdom of God is near. I pray that who ever reads this considers a life in Christ and repents from the wickedness of this world before it's too late. We don't have much time. I urge you please get right with the one true living God.Jesus loves you and so do I <3 Be blessed my loves<\3 JOHN 3:15 -21 MARK 1:15💙🤍
Beautiful!!! Excellent!!! Amazing!!

Bruno that guy frfr!
😂😂😂
i will die without them
Baaaaaaaby!
Silk Sonic makes music that should be illegal for how good they sound like. Seriously. These guys are amazing together, not only Anderson and Bruno, but the whole band works together as good as they can possibly be.
i never get tired of this performance loooord
smooth like butter
Anybody know how long there residency is in Vegas?
The shizleeeeeeeeee
i just wanna know how their cigarettes stayed lit the entire time
I love it!
Gratefull by "ressucitar" o Soul amado por tantos!!
A worthy heir to Michael jackson
I can't believe I'm 5 months late. Wow this is pure gold.
He is a treasure
smokin out the windowwww
asikkkkkkk
I found myself listening to this song while watching the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trials. I think it's because of the "this bitch...", "she belongs to everybody", "how can she do this to me?" lyrics.
Meravigliosa sensazione,la tua voce mi fa stare bene,sei fantastico,grazie.
This seems like more of a spoof than a song. I was laughing more than singing.  Lol
Galacticos!!!!!!
1:36 Yo why does bruno got me spitting my drink out my nose right there! LOL!
Lol I thought it said Jumping Out the Window but it say Smoking out of the window
What truly happens if they used the song of "this one but it is UNI-TEAM videos - BBM-SARA CONTENT" Smokin out the window, Skate & Leave the door open, will tolerate LALA out there but if PaoLuL wiews the Nostalgic content also if FlyingKitty make mental breakdown about this content, share the thoughts and anyways, This is not one when they tunning into Easy Rock Radio, this is what i know, thats the favorite and repost..                  GREATER VINTAGE
Ok they are ripping off the old school so hard.... But i love it! It was an amazing era for r&b ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
2022 bros jammin' like ol skool 60's & 70's
Bruno you'are  so so.... cool great
I play this song over and over, looooove it bad 🔥❤️😊
Relatable😔
Damn, he looks like a dancing nigga lobstah so niceee 🤤😍
When he “died” and bruno stepped over him then you just see him on the ground later still i died lol
excellent !!!!!
I guess bruno refuses to make contemporary music
This song and “Did You Call Me” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through tough times. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you 🌹🌹
2:55 not essy. He' do IT Just like it's nothing. Insane vocalist. A true master
Man sounds so fucking good...what a treat to feel that soul in music again..
Lebron doing back up singing. So nice 😁
Anderson really stayed on the ground like he died lmfaooooooo
.
Idgaf!!! Dopest shit ever!!! I aint laughed like this in alongass time!!! Good lookin!! Music is dope as fuck too!!
My 1 year old loves Bruno Mars 😍 hopefully one day we can go to a concert to see uncle Bruno
These guys never had a cigarette before the video shoot
1:35 he falls then all of a sudden at 1:52 he pops back up! Dying!!! 🤣😂😂😂😂
The ultimate in brilliance. These guys created an indescribable category.
Ooh this my song💋❤
Really enjoy this perfectly soul and R&B music with the 70s vibe!!! Sooo awesome!! Soo love the band's coordinated choreo and the falsettos and Bruno's howling near the end of the vid! Very fabulous! 😍😍😍😍😗😗😗😗
Gente incrível isso
Brothers in the back with those Temptation moves
Their moves are channeling that Temptations, the Four Tops, the Miracles, O’Jays, the Manhattans, etc. vibe. The 70’s music… moves, harmonizing, the flashy clothes, the WHOLE damn thang. THAT savoir-faire was THE BEST!  🤗 So when we say “back in day,” those were some truly some awesome days. The world was spinning but, we felt safe.
What a funky bass line...this old white boy is hooked!
>THIS >BITCH
This video is funny and FUN! 😂
oohhh sooo smooth bro....
Lmaooooooo wtf am I watching 😭😂😂😂😂😂
Them with them cigarettes 😂
This album Is something Crazy, i love It so much
Hey look this video 👉 https://youtu.be/CTwiB1uw9sQ ❤️❤️❤️
Love the song Bruno mars and Anderson
Yeah silk sonic have absolutely redeemed Bruno Mars for me, better than anything he's ever done imo
Bruno can turn anything and anyone into a hit!! Hey Bruno, we need to collaborate!!! Call me. Song too funny
This song hit the nail on the head💯💯💯💯
this needs to be will Smith's anthem
Hold up. Wasn't Anderson Paak a rapper? He is a pretty good vocalist too.
.............
I just found out such an beautiful song. Thanks to Vachirawit Chivaaree put this song on his ig last night special for Win Metawin. BrightWin always introduce me to a new song that I never listen or know before.
Johnny Depp appreciates this song more than you know.
Give me more....
But fr who got Bruno fed tf up?😂🤣
They r putting alcohol into the slash behind the counter at the gas station.  Be safe you the world has changed.
🤯
Bruno mars lindo cantas voz 🎤🎸🔥💥 por quieremos muchos
Did anyone else see Anderson laying on the floor?
Never mind the multi-grammy awards they have so rightly won - whoever did the choreography for this deserves a sainthood ... Dread to think how many takes (and cigarettes!) but they must've had great fun filming. Superb 😂
Hello BrightWins💜😌
This is my life 🤣😂🤣
i make music. But this is magic!❤️😃
I would love to see the weekend and Bruno collab
This song is just melodically perfect.
This is just a hit
Smoooooth
Love this song lol 70s vibe with today's attitude 😂
The best music moviment Bruno Mars
Always Sooooo Smooth
1:45 ladies and gentlemen, Anderson .Paak falling flat on the floor
This 70s style is so good for bruno
This song deserves grammy too. Brilliant Song, damn it!
I wish Michael was alive to hear this.... that's all I can say about this.....  You killed this Bruno!!!
I forgot what the beginning line of the chorus was and bursted out laughing when I heard it again. Whoops.  And the MV is just as funny. I should have watched it earlier.
Choreography is tight
A couple times Bruno sings, then fades back in perfect lock-step with the backup singers. This video is pure entertainment.   I feel like, if I could learn the dances that the backup singers do, I could be a hit at every wedding.
They are smoking and still kill the highnote 👍🏻
Bruno Fans gather here. Our "today I don't feel like doing anything" icon is a legend.
This funny ass hell!
Bruno Mars patpars
Nostalgia
anderson paak a comic with almost the tools you need
I hope yo raggedy ass walkin barefoot in these streets fr
Yep
easily my fav of the album
El es mi esposo solo que no lo sabe
This is a great song dedicated to Will Smith
Nailed it and at the Oscars is well.😎😎😎😎💯💯
Simps redemption song! 😂...Still grooves...
When I tell you no one could do this but Bruno.  He is Beast mode.  I love the group swag.
The cigarette is killin me 😂😂
The plot twist of the album 😂😂😂 love it 💓💓
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

It almost feel dangerous, how good this track is.
Damn they are good.

Silk sonic:the jackson five The weeknd: michael jackson

Finally a real man has the balls to show cigarettes in his video! Not some sissy BS!
These 2 guys are just amazing, can't stop listening to their music. Unbelievable how talented they are. When I listen to their music and songs 🎵 my heart soar. Silk Sonic , Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars , their vocals, movements and styles blend together so beautifully. Love,   love, love them.
Just so unique at this time, two amazingly talented vocalists and artists, amazing songs… never knew how bad I needed this!!
IN LOVE
I would have loved to have seen a  more visual/action  video!! Like a Mini movie! That would have been Dope!!
Dang that cigarette lasted the whole song :O
Producer: How smooth do you want this to be  Bruno Mars: *yes*
I cannot tell you how I was entranced by the smoothness of this song that everytime there was a comedic line I started cackling like a hyena
Aye yessir so vibey so nostalgic love the comedy speaking facts

the way he floped on the floor
I did not inhale that marijuana?!?!?!? 👍🏻🤘

Brilliant,Bruno Bruno ,Bruno how many times did I call you. Nice one
I like the way Bruno Mars is a superstar who just doesn't take himself too serious. He is tremendously talented AND hilarious!! 😄
This is crazy I am just now looking this up I a knew nothing about the guy he was singing with. Anderson, I never knew Bruno was in a duo. Always thought it was just Bruno Mars. I feel dumb, but the Anderson guy is amazing hands-down I love them together.
Lol, my son said 🤣 that is what he gets for leaving the door open 🤣.
Thus is a nice song.
This  b*tch  got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here   Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

This song and “Did You Call Me” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through tough times. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you 🌹🌹
The divorce anthem
Bruno is so crazy. He's got one of the best voices of today. I wonder how his sisters and his dad are doing? He has one sister who is such a cutie and she can sing.
Both Are Awesome 🎯💖🎶💖🎯
I can come back every month and watch Anderson be dramatic and pass out on the floor...and watch Bruno head tilt over when he say Chuck E Cheese 😆 🤣 😂
People in the 50's when someone says "She belongs to the streets" :
0:32 my boss after being absent 300 times

Best colab
THEMMMMM SUITSSSSSSS 🔥🔥

I swear Bruno is related to Sammy Davis Jr or re-incarnated💖
𝗥𝘂𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗮-𝗨𝗸𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗪𝗮𝗿: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗼𝗿𝗮 𝗕𝗼𝘅 𝗶𝘀 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 The ramifications of this war run much deeper than the impact it will cause to those directly involved in the conflict. It will reshape the world, as it is likely that other latent frictions between countries and territories will be activated as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine situation. This war just opened an era of wars, small and large, between different peoples. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently said that this war could easily become "the biggest war in Europe since 1945", and I agree. If countries with similar backgrounds cannot reach agreement between them, then how much more likely it is that several countries that have big differences and ancient conflicts may easily slip into war for no apparent justifiable reason. On a personal level, it saddens me to see how fate turns around and once again we find ourselves at war. I am sorry and restless since I have many students in Russia and Ukraine who are under threat and feel how the deteriorating situation is affecting them and the whole world. In Israel, too, I have many students who follow with concern what is happening in Eastern Europe, anxious about the fate of their family members and friends. My hope is that the manifestations of hatred between the Russians and the Ukrainians will stop soon, two peoples who have lived side by side throughout history. If it were still possible, I would give everything I could to silence, calm down, avoid the escalation, but this is impossible for now.  There is not much that we can do at this stage. We can only long for peace and a ceasefire, talk about all parties showing restraint. The parties in conflict could follow the example of the Native American tribes who buried their hostility in a ceremony during which previously warring tribes agreed to settle their differences and live in harmony, and sealed their agreement by the chief of each tribe burying a war hatchet in the ground.  Such a scenario does not look realistic under the current circumstances. Thus, above the forces of hostility, above the egoism and control as the driving forces of all the conflicts in the world, we can only raise a global prayer for peace, asking that we all get along with everyone. Because only in the power of connection and in the connection between our hearts, can a great positive force arise, a force that is able to unite all parties, to reconcile the haters, to awaken the truth in us all that we all belong to one soul. As it is written, “He who makes peace in His heights, may He make peace upon us…” (The Book of Job, 25:2)

have y'all heard the carl wheezer version? 10 times better I'm sorry not sorry
THIS SONG DESERVES A GRAMMY!!!!!!!
Motown
Yes indeed  Love it
Now this, is music.
过分丝滑了
Anderson is a totally different vibe 😂
They are smooth 🔥🔥🔥.  Love them!!!
Seawall church is my church along with Brandi Lynn Presley Verdun Kitkoski Kauffman and Andrew Longmire is a shapeshifter.
Francisco worked at Pappadeaux 5 and she's UC
Get up Crystal Nixon in your white Challenger. And you to Char is Dorismond
I wish Michael Jackson was alive to see this video
This video literally had me laughing out loud. It’s like a little sitcom.
This song is hilarious😂😂😂😂😂
1:35 made CRYING LAUGHING
Anderson Paak is a musical genius
I love this video and song. Cracks me up. The brothers have some moves too.
Why is Silk Sonic glamorizing tobacco usage?
Please, can the hooligans of this world come together and somehow get Bruno to know that he should really make an album of his unreleased music? His real music needs to be shared and enjoyed across the world.  This is what I'm talking about: "All About You" and "I Need It". These songs are too precious to let go to waste.
This is Futures favorite song
Making smoking cool in 2022 is terrible! Horrible role models
Loves this and so damn smooth!
I aint know Trevor Noah could sing
Just ridiculously brilliant. Greatest R n B album in decades. Fight me on that.
Every time Anderson Paak falls down, I crack the heck up. I can't with them. 😂😂😂😂
He still aint got nttn on Michael Jackson, but hes doing rlly well
Bro was on the floor 🤣🤣
I’d rather listen to Terence Trent D'Arby over Bruno Mars …
I’m sorry this band feels like a parody .. bring real music back
This is a great example of it's not as good as the first time
Future would be proud. "she belongs to the streets" turned into an entire song
I just enjoy this so much I ordered two cds of Bruno Mars and I’m going to be 70 in 3 months. His music if real singing music. He has a real gift and so does Anderson Paak. What’s  not to enjoy!♥️🐈‍⬛
Got this man going from catching a grenade for a female to calling her a bitch
Agent looking good out there aint he
Michael Jackson  agora o melhor pop do mundo é do bruno mars é loucura suas músicas seus videos são com bastante teatro é uma coisa fenomenal é de outra galáxia 💙🙏
This will forever be a classic
Vibing ~~~
He just did that! He played dead in a music video! 😂😂🤣🤣
Hi R&B guy
They got me a somewhat jackson 5 vibe...😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
60s vibe with a tease of today....love it
Wow! I didn't know Will Smith comissioned a song about Jada. Bruno did him right.
Bruno's lil' ass could scream "this b*tch" in my face any time he wanted to. I cannot get enough of this song. Anderson did his thing, too. This was such an unexpected and happy collaboration for me. Silk Sonic successfully captured nostalgia into a sound that sounds both familiar and refreshing, compared to literally every other thing we see on the Billboard 200 and Top 40.
How many times did you watch the video? Yes.
Luv the comedic flair.
Eu amo Bruno Mars.
I love Bruno Mars.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!        I said; I FUCKING LOVE THIS MUSIC!!
Why am I barely seeing/hearing this!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Oh babyyyyy .luvin.this  yesssssss 😘🤩✌😎luvin this duo smoking  hottttt
Why is this stuck soo bad in my brain 😂 I have a exam today I'm soo gonna write the lyrics there 😂
The fortnite skins were sick
Nice song my boy
They definitely brought back old school motown vibes. I love it
Chris brown gotta jump on the remix,🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One of the first videos that I've seen where the stars aren't dressed any different from the backup dancers and crew
😂💜
Now I can get down with Bruno because for years I didn’t care for him that much. But he’s bringing that funk funk if ya know what I mean
Happy Easter to you
I absolutely love this song
These men are using their superpowers for the good of ALL men. Listen to the words fellas... Don't be that guy!!!
How am I just seeing this? This is the dopest shit I have seen Bruno do since Locked out of Heaven!
I'm 63, Like jumping on a time machine to the music 🎶🎶🎶 of my youth.   💃💃💃🕺🕺🕺
Do you smoke, Bruno? 😜
not to be dramatic, but when I saw Anderson on the floor, I also died...laughing, rofl.
1:35 is my favorite moment in this video!
Silk Sonic, please get rid of the cigarettes!  Your health will thank you later!
Why does Silk Sonic including Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars in the song titles?  They ARE Silk Sonic!    How many kids did Bruno Mars have with the woman in question?
SMOKINNN OUT THE WINDOWWWW
Should've left the door closed
These two is some mf time travelers. What century is this song from!?!?
Anderson. Paak's part- hilarious 😆
*THIS BITCH GOT ME PAYING HER RENT*
I would never have thought that a reference to Chucky Cheese would make it into a “serious “ song. They guys are genius!
Damn soooo good

Throwback vibe much needed, great synchronized dance moves . We’ve needed this for a while . Great job ! Funny song !

Bruno reminds me of Sammy Davis Jr and MJ all in one... Absolutely Wonderful Unique Entertaining group  🎶👍🏽
This album may be the most 🔥 thing to come out in like two decades
Good music the way I remember it...
I read somewhere that Will Smith actually wrote this song
Bé voilà, c'est pas compliqué de faire de la bonne zik
Absolutely phenomenal, Bruno Mars I love your music and I love your Swag.
Not a huge fan of this type of music, but this is great
All the cursing, calling women bioch... NOT GOOD, FAIL 😒😡

Him laying on the ground! 😭
Let me question something do you know where you will go after you die? If not let me say you can have a choice to either go to hell or heaven see 2000 years ago there was this man named Jesus who died on the cross for our sins and rose alive 3 days later all because he truly loved us he died for us so I question you now do you truly believe in Jesus or do you live for the world turn to Jesus Christ trust in him Christ has way much more to give than the world he loves us turn to Christ
So Fantastic Lyrics 👍👌🤘👊. Amazing Music 🎵🎶🎵🎶. Rocking Voice Friends 👏😎👏😎. I Love It 😍🥰😍🥰.
amazing harmonies.  what a duet!
Combinação mais do que perfeita... Bruno e Anderson
Amo essa música ❤

Anderson you bad Brother 💯
Silk Sonic doing that thing
Bruo
This was not a good song in any way and then to smoke on stage nah ! Love these guys just not this song
Anymore asswipes going to fall down on the stage?!
Bruno mars my favorite artist❤
I love Bruno Mars he’s so cool I love his songs like leave the door open
Old-school 70s vibe im a 74 baby grew up on this type of music.
Yes they did the damn thang on this track 4 sho!!
seriously the smoothest shit ive ever heard/seen
Tremendo pedado de canción brillante 😎👌
Crazy how I get nostalgia without even being alive for this decade in music
I wonder what next silk sonic title of the song with a part of the house, after the ceiling, door, and window?
Bruno Mars,Person The Both of You. Sing Amazing Song. Good luck.
Love it Love it ❤
This guy will definitely be part of the showcase of legendary singers🖤
I LOVE THIS SONG ALMOST AS MUCH AS, LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN... Too funny 🤣
That high note from Bruno tho
I’m learning this dance right now 😂💿
como eu amo essa musica ^^🤧🤍🤍(conta da mae)
2:23 😂😂😂
Love these guys together. But IMO could have done without the cussing refer to women maybe say trick. If you’re going to mimick the time please be true to it without the B word and cussing takes away from the awesomeness that this is.
what I find more funny is how so many women like this song but it's a song literally talking about women who use men for their benefits and pretty much calling her a 304 and how she drove him nuts lmao.
Just wow love the sound it feels like this 50+ is drifting back in time to my favourite music era, with a modern twist….brilliant 👍
My favorite part 1:03
Ima tell my kids that this was the Temptations.
This song and “Did You Call Me?” by Lukaz just hits different in early 2022. Times may be tough but everything going to be okay in the end. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you all! 💜💜
This is so good!
Top!!!!!!!
AM I THE ONLY ONE DYING BECAUSE THIS MAN SLAM LAYS ON THE GROUND DRAMATICALLY AFTER SAYING NOT TO BE DRAMATIC???
1:37
Just cool 😎
daaaamn

First know my ex when leave my open door release , then after broke up then this song pop pup on my yt , lol this song so related what happened in my life🤣🤣🤣
Ffu
So fucking cool damn🚬
00:30 THIS BIT@H😂😂😂😂😂😂
Laughing at this music video but its also awesome misic❤️
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die." And he falls to the floor and stays there for a refrain.  Comedy gold.
Sin palabras priviligieado de poder es cuchar esta musica ke trasmite paz y alegria 💖
Lycrys  Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib  Like it's Chuck E.

رهيبه
Smokin out the window
I love music that I can understand the words🥰
This has more views on youtube than "skate". Wow did see not coming.
Y’all are awesome 👏🏽
Lmao I like when the camera pans to him still laying on the floor 🤣🤣. Love this song and loveeee Bruno 😁❤️
For some reason if you play this song at x1.25 it sounds way better...
I swear the lyrics are priceless 🤣 😂 😭
2022🇧🇷
This vid just cracks me up! Love the songs so much especially the ones with humor in them.
I'm waiting for that comment that says " they are influencing kids to smoke". 😁
These two linking up was genius they got that old school swag
The tremendous combination.  What good music
iconic
BEES FUCKIN KNEES
I wish he went back to being a solo singer again :/
These Niggas are low key comics
Awesome! Patiently waiting for the vinyl to drop in August!
zu und zu geil ich halt es fast nicht aus
*this is a type of song they play at ross*
bruno mars is the new micheal jackson but with swears
1:34
So. Much. Fun. This is what can happen when the nonsense gets dropped at the door and the creativity is the focus. Silk Sonic ftw!!!
bruno mars is my dream man idc.
will smith should give this a listen lmfao
0:26 love this part
Mfs after donating to their favorite female streamer and not getting a mention be like:
So much damn entertainment and fun music.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😂😂😂😂
I don’t get tired of this song🤣
“Like it’s chuck e cheese 🧀 “
These niccas sum living legends.. RNS
The run at the end by Bruno Mars when he takes us to church with the “I was wrong…She belongs” adlibs ?! FUK.
Wow what an amazing song it’s just masterpiece
as a fifties gal, I must admit this is very cute and well done...do it boys!!!  Kind of Motown, R & B, ballads, etc., got it all!!!
Bruno mars needs to never get rid of these Silk Sonic! What he has going on is PLATINUM!
😍Bruno + Anderson YES! But can we ALSO talk about the FINE backup singers? 👩🏾‍🦳👊🏾💥
D+
Amazing music
Wait.. They Fallin about a Prostitute? I just digested the Lyrics
the way Anderson woke cause he heard smokin out the window 🤣
Brilliant
Bruno Mars was silent for almost two years.  When he’s on hiatus, i know he’s up to something great:  Silk Sonic!
Fun fact: they are holding cigares as they were sining
Deserved all those Grammys. Fk’ng AMAZING!
Waiting this album in 8-track xD
So that bitch slept with McGregor huh?
WOWWW 👏👏👏👏🙏🇵🇷
the most talented man in the world. can sing. can dance, can write , can play instrument, can produce, can act and  etc
Yep
Impossible to be sad
psa   real smoking out the windows were used in the production of this video   camel smoking corp
...got her bada** kids running round my whole crib like it's Chucky Cheese! - now, that's a line!
Anderson sound like Michael Jackson
Why's Bruno look like the lawyer for Vice City?
If Will Smith could express himself in a song, this would be it. 😂
How many of MY BROTHERS...feel this song to their core?..
Damn I been sleeping on him he’s dope
I'm checking out those background singers...I'm just saying. Whew Chile🖤🖤🖤🖤
😍❤️😍❤️
Bem anos 80
"THIS B___CH GOT ME PAYING HER RENT...."    00:32 INSTANT CLASSIC!!!!!!
https://youtu.be/GG7fLOmlhYg?t=32
Remind me of a live performance by David Ruffin & The Temptations
So much Soul🥰! This takes me back to the good old days
so much soul🥰!
Really India needs this song dudes... it's time to shine here .
Silk looks blasted right out his tree lol
i love this song, perfect! beautiful
I kinda wish that bruno was still signed with atlantic tho but its alright his music is still fire
Bruno Mars, stay healthy ok.. ❤ you
dam never knew Kevin Hart was such a great backup singer
1:25 was so funny 🤣
This is better than chocolate!!
I stopped listening to Bruno and then started listening to Anderson so the perfect song also its the guys in fortnite
いい曲！
真的太棒了 超好聽
No ads what a good day
love this song
Mark Ronson and the entire back up singers of the song, "Uptown Funk" -- COLLAB WITH BRUNO AGAIN!
Both are superbly talented and brilliant. And the real genius is Bruno Mars. Everybody knows it.
Such a groove… Makes me feel my age.  Thanks Silk Sonic!
I love Anderson's goofiness
Quando eu resolvo parar de escutar black music me aparecem com essa versão maravilhosa, coisa mais linda e viciante de música
I just realize how he hit that floor n popped back up 🤣🤣🤣
They better not cheat us out of a world tour.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not gonna lie... I be in the car with my cigarette, singing this shit like I'm in the video
He reminds me of Sammy Davis Jr. I’m talkin bout Bruno…ultimate entertainer…
Doing a video for this song was the best decision EVER.. the theatrics from Bruno and Anderson are EPIC. No way you just listen to the song alone.. the visuals are everything
Old school is always gold, very deserved Grammy
Funny lyrics🤣👍
i got a lil concerned bout anderson .paak he was just layin there like...
Me encanta, amo como baila y como canta.
its the guy from fortnite
These 2 make a good duo. What great choice of words to make great music .
Smokin out the window
Bruno Mars ❤️🎧🙌✨
After listening to this a fews times I started to understand what they were talking about and couldn’t do nothing but laugh because it’s so relatable lol
I get mad Andy Samburg Justin Timberlake dick in a box vibes and i love it 😂

0:32
I'm 32, and this reminds me of the 70's black boy soul bands.
I want the magic that said woman possesses.😁
1:44 não tanko essa parte kkkkkk fodas d+
Such a Vibe
"Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need. But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walking 'round barefoot in these streets"   My hero
Brilliant
wow
Did I caught that restrained smile on Bruno's face while Anderson is flat on the ground? I think he's about to laugh on that moment but stayed on character long enough for the camera to pan back to Anderson.
They give a nice Jackson 5 vibe :))
Yesterday they leave their door open, today they smokin out their window. They really love stayin at home. Waiting for a song about their cabinet
Wow,  these boyz are pretttttyyyyy good!
is that Bootsy at the beginning?
https://youtu.be/-5K1cTRvxW0
That’s what Im talkin about bring the good music Back!!! The instrumental👍🏽
Vibes
They  had Grammy winning songwriters.
Pure soul, pure genius. Paak is in the zone , what a combo with Bruno....100% Dynamite ....these boys are on fire. Best music in years. Pure Grammy Gold, Congratulations guys so well deserved.
Who mastered this ???? Great job!!!
Bernie Mac would have loved this!
i KNOW ALL THE MUSIC CREATIVITY OF THIS ALBUM COMES FROM ANDERSON PAAK the black in Anderson makes Bruno Mars appear to be a great artist.
Why is this soooo smooth!!!
its a nice song and all but i think anderson paak can hit higher notes and things like that its great i think bruno is at his best and all but i think if anderson paak can hit higer notes because of his voice so yea
Smoking is so not sexy
YOOOO THIS IS THE BEST OF EVERYTHING! I FREAKING LOVR YOUR WORK BRUNO MARS!!
I love his style and his voice, talent…. I love it all💕This is my kind of music…old school with beautiful Bruno Mars!  Really loving Anderson.Paak!
Bruno Mars you went to leave the door open to smoking out the window what the heck you crazy or something or you cray cray cray
Looks like you do a photomusic of Will Smith smoking...oh shit you do it again. Hope some day I can make song with them
I just flatlined when Paak hit the floor🖐😁😁😁
😅💪💪💪💪💓
Loving it!  You deserved your grammy!  <3
Love this band 🤓
Brilliant. Just brilliant. The choreography, the humor, Bruno's pointing back and bending at the waist when singing about the kids running all over his place "like it's Chuckie Cheese". Hilarious. Great job. And it shows Bruno's character that he didn't need to be the center of attention. Simply brilliant.
basically the girl is for the streets but classy version lol
Wouw 💕😍 I like it ❤️💜
Impossível achar uma descrição boa para essa música ❤️😍🇧🇷
Just wow, 107M view in 5months 😮
Motown lives on in updated form.
Definitely can relate💨💨💨💨💨 smoking 🚬🚬🚬🚬
Preciosa canción!!
This song hit different 😍👀
I love you Bruno thanks for saving me from horrible times I just watch you I’m in heaven 🥰
The "she belong to the streets" anthem.
Bruno Mars I love you! 💕 Everything you do is perfect! Best Song ever!!!
Wow you are amazing
ömer yeterli
Months later I’m still stuck on this damn song 🤣💕
😍😍😍😍
Bravo, how could you do this to me. Marvelous song.
It's the barefoot in these streets for me 🤣🤣🤣
"But I also hope that yo trifling ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets." 😂😂😂😂 Reminds me of OJ Jones "Walking in the Rain."
Some BADD Guys!!!  Congrats on the Grammys
This band is everything, the moves the music the outfits , I can’t begin to describe the nostalgia I feel while listening to them , makes me want to be in love like we used to in the good ole days 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️💕😍
😍apaixonado nessa música
Thats how it's done!! Awesome vocals and you just know they're having the best time ever. Thank heaven for Bruno Mars and Anderson. Paak
the only time i see brono smoke
Its Giving The Jackson 5 Vibes <33
Beta simp anthem!!
Beautiful rendition of  the struggle
Oh I like it!🎶🎤🎸
My 50 year old + ass fell on the FLOOR with this one. What a GREAT song!!!!
There's nothing better than Silk Sonic
The people that disliked this masterpiece should get their covid test, because one of the main symptoms is no taste
The pose after Chuck E Cheese and the facial expression. Then the first this bitch. Theeeen the falling down after being dramatic. 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭
I'm not speaking for all women BUT...I'm 52 and really appreciate this slow, sexy vibe.  I feel this type of vibe would put me in a better mood than the rough rap vibe. JS
Next level BRAT PACK!!🥳🥰🤩🤯
Great to hear these won a Grammy. And Jon Batiste too .Fresh yet old school soul.
Vibe anos 80, não poderia ser melhor ❤
Besser als gut- Grandios!
The retro vibe is so sexy. Really really awesome.
Wow,Wow,Wow
It like going back on times.. I love it 😻.!!
My parents.
Llego aquí , la canción ya tiene 5 meses y aún así de tantas veces de haberla producido me da un escalofrío ,  Es la sensación del éxito!
I searched this bitch by bruno mars coz i didnt know the title of the song
I come back here for watching Anderson dying. I keep listening to this song.
They lost me on the "this bitch"..... they got a lot of promise, but guys back in the day wasn't calling women out their names.
they are so effortlessly cool wow
This deserved a Oscar 2 shiiiit this s... right here ( Katt Williams Voice )
Hehe this is what sugar daddies' feels when his sugar baby ghost them.
wtf
Paak is so talented. He has it all: singing, playing, dancing and comedy. Love from Italy
This beat is so cold. Forget buying a freezer.
1:33
I'm so looking forward to see Anderson .Paak playing dead in a live performance
Fantastic.  80s.  Cool😎
Definitely new favorite jam. On repeat
On the floor then cuts in from the left. How fun would it be to hang with these guys.
This cold..Very Very Cold 🧊
Cheers to all the fellers still smoking out their windows!
SO PODE TSR DROGA NESSA MÚSICA EGUAAAA
Love you so much, but Bruno your gonna shorten your precious life by smoking!  We need you here on earth to enjoy you for so many years to come. That just f’s up your God gifted  lungs!!!!

But, tell the story of how Andre "Pete" 3000 got fired from the group!
LOVE! So smooth!

She wasn't a b**** when she got with him. Why is it when a woman...nevermind.  "Men" are a trip.
"Not to be dramatic but I waaaana die." Proceeds to lie on the ground dead in the music video.  Chefs kiss.
Masterpiece
I am sad that the video was not uploaded in 4K!! Leave the Door Open was in 4K but this is still 1080p?? Why?  4K should be the industry standard now already common ! It's already 2022.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯 I Absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!!!
Who is this bitch she sounds magical
OMG!  I know you will never, ever read this.  You are amazing!
Best Bruno video ever. Anderson is FIRE
This should be a anthem for good men taking the red pill😼
I really love this❤️❤️❤️
I learned about this group from the Grammys. Oh joy!  Now I’m literally praying that other groups will bring back the sounds of the 70’s.  Brilliant!
Bruno’s vocals are crazy
Vocals so crisp and harmonic it brings a tear to your eye 🥲
Remember men, she’ll always do it!
i love how they are all holding cigarettes
Damn, this duo is everything I needed.
Searched for this bitch, and this song showed up
This is one of the greatest things I've ever seen.
POOR GUYS... ONLY JOKERS. TRASH MUSIC..
omg the fortnite guy
I can’t believe Bruno Mars can be this cool!! They are literally dripping with coolness!
Bruno should play Sammy Davis Jr in something
Bruno Mars is Michael Jackson 2.0
1:35
“She belong to the streets” -Future but Bruno Mars style
I hate that it took the Ike Turner fit to make me finally check them out. Those Grammys were well-deserved. They are brilliant.
Youtube kareoke Diana krill string along
I really love this track. If you have never had somebody have you smoking out the window, you could never understand the accuracy of these lyrics. Right down to the “I hope you out here barefoot in these streets”🤣🤣
other artists out there trying their best to enter the charts (or whatever) and these artists right here are just chillin and having the best time of their lives
❤️🎶
This is what you literally call MUSIC
Those people vibin' w this beats are trully having a wonderful taste.
Nice 👍
Smoking out the window of a White Dodge Challenger with Crystal Nixon later in the day.
How did I not realize they were smoking
listening to this immediately after "just the way you are" is such a trippy experience XD
Bruno looking like Sammy Davis, Jr😁
I never comment, but I had to on this. this is seriously one of the most incredible videos Ive ever seen. Completely satisfied.
O melhor cantor internacional 👏👏👏👏👏👏🙌🙏
Silk Sonic is the next best thing to canned cheese. FRIGGEN LOVE THIS MUSIC!!!!!
Love all of them a Team  in all of it!!!!!🙅🏽‍♀️🤑💯🙏🏿🤑💯💕🙏🏿🤑💕💯
💜
Fresh air compared to rap crap!
How the eff have I never even once heard any of this Silk Smooth ridiculous amazingnes until literally just nao??? 😯   I've said it before a million times & I'll st it again millions more: Bruno Mars can do no wrong. I won't hear of *anything* to the contrary. Don't even try that sacrilege with me, period. Some things are just factually true 🥰 🙌 🤩💞💗
Is the Best song and the Best video, this song is my ring on my finger
This shit high key 🔥
You. Know. Someone that’s obsessed with the uniformity of Motown… I’ve always loved Bruno Mars’s
Is Bruno sick? He looks very skinny.
i’ve been missing out 🥲 their music is so good
This is the most terrible thing I ever came across
Retro baby,  love it!
This won a Grammy????????????????????????? why???
Midge
GORGEOUS
My grandparents love this group
I can't LOVE this enough!!!!
they ate
the vibe
Love them so much 😍😍😍
Clean sweep at the Grammys! So happy for them! Still my favorite song!
These songs and videos are absolutley fabulous!!!  Melodic, dance worthy, smiling the whole time!!!  Nicely done!
En serio? Esto es tu canción de queja contra una mujer? Hay por Dios y te dieron un Grammy!!!
I juz tripped while dancing in my room
I love it I'm 60 yrs old and had get off my ass and dance to this beautiful song Brovo brother
LOVE these guys and that Temptations vibe! ❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful song disco time!
Why does everyone including females think it’s ok to talk down about women? When y’all do this you talking about you mama, you auntie and grandma. If it wasn’t for women you wouldn’t be on this earth. They done got hospitals calling women “birthers” instead of women. We gettin attacked from everywhere. You’d think at least our men would be tryin to protect us.
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
They need a residency in Las Vegas
This is what I've been waiting for!
I swear that I didn't even know that this band even existed until Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak got up to accept their Grammy last night.  Their smooth moves had me laughing and wanting to hear more. Now I want to hear every song they have created.  Brilliant artists!
That's right Bruno,, keep it it old school with a new twist.
I love Anderson Paak so much 😭💕
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die~" Proceeds to lay down. Pan to Bruno. Anderson still laying down. Anderson suddenly jumps into frame. LOL. I am crying laughing.
This video clip😍
These guys are the reincarnation of the 70's and 80's Motown stars.
Not the 'this bitch' 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
AZ H https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
WHO THOUGHT OF ROB KARDASHIAN THE INSTANT YOU HEARD THE LYRICS AFTER THE WORD "BITHCH"🤬🤬🤬.      HA! HA!
They're a number one class act...and I'm old.  Love 'em!  Congratulations on your Grammy wins!
Fantastic stuff. - That 70's Guy
Nice vocal, vibe and production, BUT... "this bitch"? ... "thought this girl belonged to only me"?  Really?
ブルーノ最高🧡
Первый)

Bruno Mars throwing the grenades back and sent the moon to voicemail

Congrats Silk Sonic! you do deserve the Grammy Award!!
Shouldn’t have won as many Grammys as it did.
2021 summed up for me💀
Siendo sincera ta bonita la cancion pero quiero q regrese bruno mars  :(
I luv it
The song is great. And who ever produced and directed the comedic song in the video is hilarious and genius. Excellent video.
These guys make the best weeding themes
Bruno Mars just keeps making hit after hit man what a legend
Who is here after this song got the Grammy award for the song of the year
Those brothers are simply smooth.
Damn ! This is the perfect song to mess with our minds ! On one hand, musically and vocally speaking, it's a perfect tune for making love with a girl. On the lyrics'end... eeeeer....
My absolute best of Bruno Mars in this performance is when he got on his knees and the best part is when he gets up with  that swaggah in his step Im east coast
I love this song to deaf🥰
Oh my God,  more than a hundred million viewers,  baby check out this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilqg1lwiTms&t=14s
This was released on my birthday and I did not even notice
Where Is The Work Husband?  Where Is The Work Husband?  And are you sure that that is the right one?  Is that really Adam? And or the one who comes in after him?  Where the fxkx is Adam?   How is someone else just doing his job then?   If the janitor is working as the CEO then where is the other CEO?  And then who the fxxk is cleaning up the environment?  1:33 "Rejoice in the truth and not the chaos" -- tHB. "If you wanna go fast go alone. If you wanna go far, go together" -- African Proverb. "Be Busy Like The Wise Ant" -- tHB. Im starting with my truth. Its best when you didnt build it all yet. That little shark. That little lie grows with the village truths. As those grow too. BEDMAS. Youve got to divide before you multiply. Game of Thrones was just the family tea. Politics is just the inter working of friends working together. And or poeple coming together to hopefully fight for what is right// good for the community. gOD in the valley. Im not worried about the oe that I can see coming. "Save Half For Harvest" -- tHB. We Build then righteousness based on truth. Its a horrible place to be. But a great place to start. What is hidden peace will bring to you. 1984. Let it not be war. Truth towards solution is what peace can bring to you then too. If you build with righteousness based on truth. There's Hope. You judge me for feeding the emotionally homeless? The spiritually homeless? The spiritually homeless? There is a truth in the fake smile in a crowd that is frowning. "Your vibe attracts your tribe". And so if you have to balance it out in the letter that means that you can no longer keep up with the lie. That means that somewhere in the lie your living in an environement of truth. Im not twisting my brain to understand your lies. But the homeless are tired of lying. Most likely to tell the truth of what is really wrong within the homes, the family, that is the foundation of society. "You wanna know about life, then go to your house in the mourning" -- tHB. Talk with the ones who can no longer keep up with the lies. Sometimes you just have to say when for the ones who will do almost anything to keep going. The leaves die before winter. And if "Autumn Refrain" then who kills of the leaves throughout the harsh winters that they were never supposed to endure. Did anybody account for that when they stopped the fall. The scales need to balance first. So where do you put the leaves to rest during the winter. So that they are not running rabid when they just shouldnt be. Who is autumn VP? Where do you run to? And wher do you put your thoughts, efforts and interest into? That will tell me about you. And then how can you love in an emotional baseline? What about an emotional surplus? You did wrong prison. You did right outside of society. Libraries still need to be guarded. Especially when there is inner peace near. Who helps the ones stock up for hibernations? Who feed the leaves that dont like like they should during the winter season! The poeple need a break and so who is taking over when helping the ones when they should be resting? And or securing a space where they can rest. It still snows in the winter right? With and or without a boss. And so then who then harvest? There are two harvesters for every deck. And so then two CEO's. President and First Lady like Adam & Eve. Are work marriage. Not personal life Marriage. And so then where has Adam been working all this time? You stand on your truth. And so then where did // how did you let the people stand on there truth. Even if it is something somewhere new? Where did you give room for growht? Culture shock? New environment? Growing Pains? Fear? Fright? "Did you maybe hide the sayings of the dark from the youth" -- tHB. Cause you wanna tell them before the truth find them. And they fear even you. And they fxxk up any process that you may trying to make. When you want the people to fear you and then it works. And they fear you so bad they have confrontation with calculated promises expectations with no truth brought to you. How do you deal with truth? What happens if they fxxk up? Put people in a place that is good for them and then see who you are dealing with? See what you see. Did you account for the translation in language bearers and or cultures? Born A Crime by Trevor Noah. That man will build an arc. All the africans came together but they could talk but they didnt all understand each other. Equity before the equality. Even J Cole Let the money get to him before he understood that it wouldnt buy him happiness. ATM KOD. You give a homeless man a 100 and then you try and judge what he does with it. Come on he may not even know where his next meal is coming from. He may not even have a roof over his head. Did you teach the man to fish and or risk destabilizing the environment? Did you teach him the beauty of the environment first? The beauty of peace first. Its not everything. But did you make room for how guest can be treated apart from family? What about the proper way for how to treat strangers. If you dont like them then let them go. Why do have someoen that you dont like stay? So then did you try and understand the connective tissue then first. Did you try and understand why that person wasnt there yet. Matthew 7:5. Was that an in house problem? Did you start there; yet? James 2:20. "Do Not Embrace Ignorance" -- tHB. Problems at homeland you get mad at the guest. Did you even at least first acknowledge the problems within the house. Is it connected to the guest. Did you address it this way and then maybe send the guest on there way to address the family issue. Or did you just get made at the foreigner? What about the truth? Why are they there? Why havent you gotten rid of them yet? Start with there connection to you? Start with the connective tissue between the mutual friends. Between the common interest. Did you address Jonadab yet? And or the sibling that did the crime yet? And or are you just getting mad at Tamars friend. Pre and or Post Ashened. If you dont like speak truth. You can send them to a better environment. And deal with the problems within the home. Start with the truths that you can carry. "Do not hide the sayings of the dark from the youth" -- tHB. Why dont people warn the kids of the spirituality adn or the soulfulness?That your soul can pulled out of your body through sexual violation? Did no one want to warn tAMAR about that first? Matthew 7:5 James 2:20. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.

5 Figures with Splendor...  -Ace Spade ♠️
Anderson Paak is so fine tho🥴
it's a master piece but I need references about "how could she do this to me", is that a song?
Bruno is the ultimate showman, he can sing, he can dance his butt off, he's a great writer and a great producer.
yep she belongs to everybody 😑...............  These lyrics are pure gold lol
OMGG mom its the guy from FORTNITE!

Honestly I was about to search "Bruno Mars- this bitch got me!" Thank God I got it on first try

Круто
Camera roll🎥 one take please or they get burn their fingers 😂
Lmao I love when they’re like “this bitch got me paying her rent, paying for trips” 🤣🤣
You already know my dudes got high and made this
It’s the way they even got the 70’s movements down that’s got me in tear 😂. The way he pointed when he said “running round my crib” the way my uncle dies when he cussin us out 😂
Now all that's left is a collaboration between these guys and bradio
Really  smooth  Song.  These guys  are awesome.
I like
My name is also Bruno, but the only difference is that I sound as a dying bird when I try to sing
This whole album, on repeat, everyday. Silk Sonic is pure bliss!
Awesome and amazing  big fan of Bruno Mars and another parkk
Yoo
1:33 don't mind me
The vibing at begining got me
Will Smith be like:
If Silk Sonic does not win a Grammy I will lose all faith in the music industry.
I like how Anderson. Paak and Bruno Mars both had a chance to shine not just with this song but every song they found a way to Co exist and it’s Silky Smooth
These brother's  know  how to Singh and move
This Song is my two loving Daugher s Songs. They just like to play it's over and over.

"Do Not Embrace Ignorance" -- tHB. The Mad Hater. Two Tables. “Big On Big” — Migos.     Matthew 7:5 James 2:20. 1:12 Koffee - West Indies (Official Video) There are Two Leos. And so The Mad Hater  Is really just two seperate tables. One for equality.  The other for equity. 0 - 11 = 12 Zodiac Signs.   0,1,2,3, 4,5,6,7 4,5,6,7 8,9,10,11  "For the lowly there is wisdom" -- tHB.  Bottoms Up and or from the ground up. From The Roots up.  8,5,10,7 Is one wave. Of equality. 0,5,2,7 Is the other wave of equity.   Two Libras too.   One is equality.  The other is equity.  "Be Busy Like The wise Ant" -- tHB.  Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.
The guy got in a jam with her ex in ufc 🤣😂🤣
<3
Quick, someone send this to Will Smith and save his ass. 😑
💜💜💜💜🎶
The subtle and smooth choreography
Thank you for some more magic from you guys.  Just perfection.
This song and “Did You Call Me?” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through these tough times. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you ❤️
These kats are lit ....I love it !
YASSSSS
Esses dois juntos é tudo de bom!!
Gives me good boys 2 men vibes
This is a great
the fact that when anderson fell he never got up until it was his turn to say "SmOkIn' OuT tHe WiNdOw~"
Smooth. I cant stop singing . Like the best cheesecake
I thought somewhere on YouTube, I am not sure if it was a radio visit or interview that Bruno wanted to try other things and that is exactly what he has done. They remind me so much of Motown. Temptations, four tops, Harold Melvin band the blue notes. The group would all dress in the same outfit. There was always a main singer and usually three backup singers. They always did the dance steps together.
Singing this with my friends in the car is one of my favorite memories
This boy done fell on the floor I hollared😂
I swear, to hear these men sing You Make Me Feel Brand New by The Stylistics with harmonies and all that will be the death of me.

1:02 Eve - Who's That Girl? (Official Music Video). He secured the baby before he helped her with her career. She started at like fourteen right.  Céline Dion - A New Day Has Come: Making the Music Video.  Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 0:02 Selena Gomez - Good For You ft. A$AP Rocky (Official Audio). You're taking up space. Mimi accidentally messages Shawn Mendes as the wrong Shawn. You need to talk to Mariah Carey. Thats not for me, that for you. What is often times too  much for the wrong one is sometimes not enough for the right one. 4, 1,6,3. There are two  5,6,7,8. In the 0-11 sequence. And so if going to saggitarius is not for you. And you are still standing on your truth. Then try Mariah Carey, Beyonce, Angelina Jolie. Try something. But  you need to find your team. You're in the way, you cannot just keep standing here. Boundaries  are great but when you are still stopped at the intersection and the light has turned green, well now you are just blocking traffic. Im not gonna get better at going around you! Learn to move to the better right direction. If you like being like this true to you, then do so in a positive and healthy way and then go out there and find someone who is gonna like this version of you. Dont get better at hidding your light and or diming your light and nor getting stuck. 0-11.  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 4 5 6 7  8 9 10 11  I mean Two 4 5 6 7  So 4 1 6 3. Thats what  you should be doing with  Chris Evans Then. But youve got to get moving hun! Im not trying to  wrecking ball you. And nor bear you with a horn at an intersection. AS my mom says  (A Gemini) you never know someone could be  having a heart attack. Take time. Have patience.  Take Care. Drake, Rihanna. But Im gonna give you  a courtesy horn tap and nudge you to get going. If  not drive into a parking lot, go into a libra I mean library.  You shouldn't sit in parked cars, and not sit in parked cars  in your parking lot. Always drive in your car with locked doors.  Less you risk someone else hop in! Be Safe. Stay Safe. "Be Busy  Like The Wise Ant" -- tHB. The Real You is needed. Go to where you  are appreciated. As the best real and honest version of you. Its not all  4 9 6 11. There are two middle grounds. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.
Smooth,  rude and funny i like these 🤘😍🤪
เพลงโคตรดี
Saaaaaaassddddddfffg
Yeah smokin💯🎶🇵🇭
THIS. IS. IN. CREDIBLE!!! I love it — they’ve captured the sound and all the grandeur of 70s soul music in a completely over-the-top love song to Black Music!!!
This man on the floor playing dead … I’m in tears 😭 lol lol
Silk Sonic Vs Randy Watson and the Chocolate Lovelites! Lol! Peace!
What this be mgtow anthem? Kekw

Ese bruno es una pasada 🔥🔥
Hey, I want to remind you that God loves us. His miracles are real. Just trust Him and always pray. If you are experiencing depression, anxiety, lack of finances, or anything that makes you doubt yourself, just remember that we have God and he will provide for our needs. Nothing is impossible for God; just keep your faith in Him and don't stop praying 😊😊😊😊😊😊
BRAVO!
These dudes are the Slaughter House of the current RnB stuff.
Incredible presence on the stage. He has Style...

Bruno Mars, eu escolhi te AMARRRRRRRR 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
o poder do Bruno Mars de nos transportar para o passado é incrivel, som melodias e bits que são maravilhosos
When Daryl Hall says this could've been a Delfonics song, you know you got it right.
Wait a minute this love started out so tender so sweet….

Love you Bruno Mars!❤️
ONE DAY THIS SONG WILL BE A LEGENDARY SONG THAT WE WILL NEVER FORGET ❤️
I love it
Anderson Paak is a hot mess 😂
its so in sync! love it~~
Too smooth 😎
Even though you may have male singers that can sing a roof off a church. You can not deny Bruno is 1 of the 5 best male singers in today's generation. My top 5 are Tyrese, Tank, Bruno, Charlie Wilson, Chris Stapleton. Damn I forgot about Sisqo
Classy and creative video thumbs ☝
Bruno is just a freaking genius!!
The way that  Anderson  full and got up to sing 🤣🤣😅😅I loved that part  this bitch got me paying the rant paying for chrips Dimonds on her nek Dimonds on her risk
bruno, pls colab with doja cat
I can't stop listening to this song... and i dont complain.
This is a masterpiece... nostalgia and a good laugh... You nailed it guys!!!!!
So smooth
JAKSEL WKWKW

I love this joint 💗
Look at my cousin just banging out on the piano...
Que vozes, que delícia escutar...Março 2022🌟🌟🙏
Look at paak looking like a young Bobby Womack 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Itz  the Guy. From fortnite
bruno mars could switch down to backing vocal and make the main singer on stage look bad
<3
I wish he said "Streets" than "Everybody"
You notice the song only has a 103 million views not as popular as his other ones.... This is about men's feelings that's why...women CAN'T handle the Truth.
damn this song hits!!!!

Love the video! Anderson Paak's...... this b*tch got me (that part!!!) 😂😂😂😂 You guys are the best
It went from peacefully to emotional damage
I hate being old and 7 months older than mars and just now hearing this lol this is great
I love the spoken bit, Ink Spots done by Chappelle. And Anderson dying and staying dead until he's needed again.
Guy from fornite
This sh** is ill.
Why they gotta say "this bitch" tho lol
Not to be dramatic… but i wanna die 💀 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow
Is Bruno Mars also on the drums?
https://youtu.be/4aOKj_AKjTc
This is one of the best music videos I’ve ever seen tbh. Love the cinematography
Who hurt this man????😩
He laid on the floor 😂😂😂
Vegas show was amazing - Bravo to Bruno and all the crew!  Much love - even if your people took all of our phones before the show....
Love it!
Ufff a whole vibe
O Grão Mestre.  ☆♡♡♡♡♡☆
This song is absolutely fire!! 🔥🔥🔥💯
>>> *how could she do this to me* ,,, As Smooth As Silk Sheets On A California King <<<
bruno went from "ill jump infront of a train for ya" to "imma put you infornt of a train" lmao
Are you Buddhist (?)
If Jackson 5 Michael Jackson had a baby, I think it’s safe to say from a music standpoint with the constant hits and being up top, you can say it’d be Bruno. Or maybe it’s the just the vibes from the video🤔
We need much more of this!
I love rap, but Bruno Mars, Silk Sonic, Anderson .Paak hit so hard.
I can relate to this song and i dont like that fact but i enjoy it:)
FUCKING MASTER PIECE
I just love all his music videos even his windows 10 years ago
Bruno mergulhou de cabeça nos anos 70. E está feliz por isso, dá para ver
WHY IS THIS NOT VIDEO OF THE YEAR??!!!! YALL BROTHERS KILLED THIS WITH EPIC AND THE HILARIOUS!!!
Future is proud
damn girl did he dirt
Bruno is a genius + Silk sonic 🔥🔥🔥
Excellent!
OK GUYS, I swear Ill cancel every fucking trip and business i got,  Too see this extraordinary and and perfect performance in "the Apollo theater" in "Harlem."  I swear I'll be there, i can afford more than sitting next to the dumpster. Thank you guys, for this... omg..2022
The song Lit🔥🔥
I thought i was the only one.... Thank you guys...  Dre... i am not a NOT a musician,  but if you want to put any one on a 96 hour,  not food, no sleep, and writing straight bars,... gimme a message.  Thank you for being selective.. 2022.  The whole crew killing... on every track.. wow.
How the Fuck is Dr. Dre, and aftermath,.  assemblemling  a crew with so much soul, singing my soul ?
It's hard to capture this kinda soul,  I grew up, 15 minutes from the apollo thearter... and its crazy and delightful at the same time, too bruno mars, not single out and pigeon holes as, a china flu or asian flu, covid causes... working with bros of soul... nice..  2002
#EzBand
It's the SONG OF THE #SIMP 🤣🤣🤣
Not “This.Bitch. Got. Me. Paying the Rent…”🤪🤣😂🤣😭
These guys know how to produce a record.
2:45
1:30
Bruno went to the 70's & is not coming back y'all. Song is sweet though 👌👌🔥🔥
"This Bitch" is creative, entertaining & funny, I love it!   So many entertainers are so busy trying to be over the top they forget to have fun. These guys have a great time up there
Absolute genius 👌👌
My Mom Was Singing And Smoking Out The Windows 😭😂
first time seeing the video whoa yall killed the song and video!!! loving the vibe❤❤❤
Vc que esta lendo esses comentários não desista a sua Vitória vai chegar Deus não esqueceu de vc Um certo dia quando eu estava passando por varias provações desânimo querendo desistir resolvi escrever tudo que eu estava sentindo e entreguei nas mãos do Senhor e confiei o Senhor restaurou a minha vida mas dei a volta por cima e ainda transformei minha dor em música Veja oque Deus fez.  https://youtu.be/gKultcGm8xQ

Seeing the vibe that these guys can produce I'm pretty sure this video was done in one take! :))
🖤🖤🖤🖤🎧🎛🎚🔊🔊🎶🎶🎶🎶🔥🔥👹👹👹🇨🇺🇨🇺✌🇺🇲🇺🇲🕺💃💃💃💃💃💃💃🚬🚬🚬🚬
Dave Chapelle should be proud. His DNA is all over this.

How my boy pak popped up from the floor to sing his verse 🤣. This song and performance is genius!
I thought I liked this song until he called the lady the b word
This is a hit like if u think so to
Mixed feelings about this. Love the cool vibe but reject the sexism. The character in the song worships $$$$$, perhaps she left him because he is a dud root.
Ok boyyyyyyyy first it said I'mma leave the door open for you and now it's like I'm going to kick you out the door
i love how bruno used to be like pop genre but know his songs give me smooth jazz vibes very nice, silk sonic keep up the good work!
Bruno Mars need to be number one on the billboard that's a beautiful sun I just listen to it all the time
damm Bruno aint catching grenades no mo
Rap meets do wop? Love it!
Cool and best video
the smoothest disrespectful song ever haha
Hotmess! 😂😂 I love this so much
This one is definitely for the fellaz
as a person who is a strong hater of most pop today just being overly dramatic sad love songs, I can admit that this one, is more amazing then the rest. Bruno Mars always holds a place in my heart no matter what genre
Álbum of the year ❤️💥🎉🎊
That old school feel mixed with new age lingo and issue🔥🔥🔥"help me please"
🙌🙌🙌
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How? How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (one thing's fasho) (One thing's fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belong to everybody) That girl there, she belong to everybody, ooh  Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope That your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window (hoo-ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (woo-hoo, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belonged to everybody) (Yeah, yeah, she belonged to everybody) ooh

Classic Bruno vibes
Think I just died and gone to heaven watching this  . Pure bliss 😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I have this song on repeat. When I first heard it, I listened to the music, the instruments only. I wasn't focused on the lyrics but after a month or so hearing this song again I actually HEARD the lyrics!! And that's when I finally realized how genius this song actually is. It has that old school soul/funk vibe to it & I love it.!😍
I. Want more
Bruh I like this song but I can’t get it out of my head and it’s f**king with me. Anyone else having this problem? Lmao
Life can be funny Chucky cheese

Bruno Mars is 100% the only man on earth who can rock just mustache without looking like he’s not allowed within 20 feet of an elementary school.
Hilarious! 😂😂 Love!
Reminds me of the days of Motown ohh those were the days!
Bruno looks like Sammy Davis Jr. Here
Gênio da música
These boys on 🔥
Wow I think everything is in its right place everything is perfect, the stage decor, the singers' clothes, the mic and everything is so cool I was doubting is this from the 80s? It's just been reposted, and I think it's a little profanity so that's good, I'm obsessed with everything I really like the performance and the music and the singers and wow everything is great🤍🤍
1971 vibes i LOVE it my year i was born let i just wanna feel it
I wanna believe this song is about Amber Heard lol
This video reminds me so much of Sesame Street. lol
O melhor do mundo! 👏👏👏
OMG, I just LOVE Bruno!😆😄😁🥰 He's sooo down to earth,but suave at the same time! Super-talented!!❤

BAD SONG !!!
its the "oh no" and the "woah oh" for me
And the end of the day DO YOU
Bruno Mars one of the biggest entertainers in the world having no problem being a back up singer on a song is the coolest thing ever. Have to say these dudes together form one of the best R&B groups I've heard.
When you realise silk sonic were being gentleman by saying city not street
Oh shit yeah!
Love how the kept the smoke in the hand damn near the whole song...so slick with it...
What a beautiful way to say she belongs to the streets.
thank you mark ronson,for bruno mars ,
Just discovered this ....so good..the music is great and lyrics absolutely genius 👏.
How to say in finesse that she belongs to the street ? Damn.
Its the cigarettes for me..🤣

That Bruno Mars is one funny dude
AWESOME SONG.
Wow...... totally 🔥
Funny thing is they actually both are smokers lol

Bruno Mars never disappoints
And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:7 NASB1995
Amo vcs
I am here from a chanel which is Tài Smile
As genius as the whole construct of this is and the execution, the thing that makes me most impressed is how Bruno is in perfect time coming up off his knees to resume the choreography! That's dedication to the art
Its 2027 who is still listing to this masterpeicpeice😍💝   5:34p.m|  fri,march.  2k27🎬
Ah, this vibes make me wondering those good old days......
epitome of perfection - the choreography, acting, feeling the lyrics and melody, a sensibility to the 70s funk and rare grooves, layered with a fine touch of humour. cannot help loving it!
100 000 000 views 🥰
Bruno, Anderson...musical heroes.  Straight up.  🎵
I thought I saw her with the island boys☠️
We needed this.  Music needed to bring the fun back. Thank you for this perfect MoTown vibe.
https://youtu.be/cklOJhg3YCg GBU 🇵🇷
me re cago de risa cuando se levanta de la nada, in-superable
I love you, Anderson Paak! You so sexy!
i love these songs
Drinking Hennessy room temp to this feels right
I’m feeling it
Get right with Jesus people. Time is short this secular music has more influence on you more than you think. The devil is here to distract you and send as many people to hell with him. This world is getting closer to the end and your time here is short. look at the what's happened in just the past few years with corona, wars, inflation and crypto. Nothing is a coincidence. If the devil can keep you distracted until the moment of your death bed he's got you. Life is short but eternity is forever and you either get eternity in life with Jesus in heaven or in death (aka hell) no in between. You need to be perfect to enter heaven and none of us are, we've all have fallen short of the glory of God but Jesus lived a perfect life and and he is perfect in everyway. He sacrificed himself on the cros because he loves you and does not want you to go to hell. He wants you to live with him for eternity. I'm not trying to scare anyone but this is serious  nothing on this earth matters but your relationship with jesus Christ. Have faith in him and you shall be saved and ONLY Jesus. Don't trust in your works, you being baptized or how good you are . it is a free gift of eternal life just believe in your heart he died for your sins and your faith is counted as righteousness. Your sins will be washed away with is pure sinless and holy blood.
I"ve always been fascinated by Bruno. Mars music style... Its so uniquely HIM..
Lol...They would have fit right in the 70s ❤️☺️😁
1:35 is what your looking for
This song is dedicated to all the men out there that have been burned by all the women  out there.
❤️
He went from "Treasure, that is what you are. Honey, you're my golden star" to " *THIS. BITCH.* GOT ME PAYIN' HER RENT"
l
That dance move...silky smooth
BRUNO YOU'RE VOICE IS LIKE AN ANGEL 😇 💖 PLEASE MAKE SOME MORE SWEET SONGS MISSING YOU

Bruno is the only one making authentic shit, taking you back to the 80s vibe choreography and everything a pure masterpiece.
1:33

Those cigarettes just kill me!!! 😂😂😂 the way they hold em when they're emphasizing parts of the song! "This bitch..."
Pops into view THIS "BITCH".... had me dying
bruno mars really giving andersen the shot
FUCK YOU EARNST BLAND YOU STOLE MY MONEY AND YOU WERE GOING TO POSESS ME RIGHT
1:36 is what you came here for
Funny thing forget the cd thing because I don't want to rap anymore and I hate Chris Terry and he has an extra debit card all the time and he will steal everything like he said because he wants to kill the north Korean dictator and he still has a bomb gun
Give up Juan Paredes knows that Belagio sexually molested me and Earnst Bland stole $200.00 and I can't stand that one rumor about me being a prostitute and I can't find Tommy Kitkoski and he loves me and get up Kevin Pageant because Tommy Kitkoski is with Amanda Carr Maldone or Regina Marie Rivas and she rapes him and I don't think Natalie Serretta would care about Julia's heart shape box and Ronda Harrington hates me too and I can't believe that you still steal money Robert Bruce because Charvis Dorismond deacon 5. Funny you care about me and Kenneth you're banded and I give up because Jakob Polk County knows that Belagio sexually molested me and my family is here with me and I make mistakes and I give up earnst bland because you stole my money, my Harley Davidson thing and give up earnst bland because Juan Paredes cares about the bionic legs and I can't believe Veronica Garcia cares about me and give up earnst bland ripped me off and I don't want to be afraid anymore because of gangs and I will not turn my back on David Kaufmann and I don't love Chris Terry and he knows how to hack into phones and steals lots of my money and I don't think Elvis Lane Eldridge would care because I didn't do criminal mischief in Sante Fe and it's a federal offense to steal Kenneth you're banned for stealing my identity and my license was with Leonardo and cut off the dollar in penny out bitch  Jessica Baber hates Tommy Kitkoski too and funny that she steals and she hates me along with earnst bland and he wants me dead
This gives me vibes from the 80s
W song
Everytime "This Bitch " 🤣🤣🤣
this group making like 60s or 80s vibes of songs this 2020s... smooth and soft..
my obsession with this song grows with time
Anderson .Paak peakin out “This bitch got me…” got me 😂!
The way when he said not to be dramatic but I wanna die 🤣 DID HE ACTUALLY LAID DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND PLAY DEAD LIKE A DOG!?
Ferdinand Marcos to Imelda:
Dying laughing the man is on the floor lol
This Song is Fire !!! On repeat over and over

Get out of the Valley Noah! ”Save Half For Harvest" -- tHB. 2: 38 You Right by Doja Cat ft The Weeknd.   Mountain Tops And Something!   What is a Valley for The Bottom of A Mountain?  "Do Not Embrace Ignorance" -- tHB. 0:31 Okay make a square with your hands.  Umm like make two L's with your hands.  And then make a square out of them; not a rectangle. The extra room on your  fingers is how you have room for District 13. Room for Skateboarding. You roll when you fall. You don't fall flat!   And then its 0-15 = 16 Zodiac Signs.   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 12 , 13, 14, 15.  And then "The first shall be last and the last shall be first" -- tHB.   So   15, 2, 3, 4,   5, 6, 7, 8   9, 10, 11, 12  And then the remaining 14, 0 and 1.  They over see the in-between rows.   They bring the light in the dark hours.   "Carry your candle into the darkness" -- tHB.   Kind of thing.   So that would be       15, 2, 3, 4, 1        5, 6, 7, 8  0        9, 10, 11, 12 14  and then like if you wrote that on both psalms of your hands.  When you flip your hands to make a square.   The numbers on the other hand end up upside down!!  Its reflected upside down in the mirror nest pas.  I don't know yet how to write numbers upside down   yet in the comment sections but the reflected version   and then just put the numbers upside down it goes a   little something like this.                                       |                              15, 2, 3, 4,               |     1                                  |                                                                   5, 6, 7, 8                |               0                                 |                                                               9, 10, 11, 12 13  |              14                                | _________________________________________________                                     |                                    14                                      |      13   12 11 10 9                                      |                                       0                                          |                8, 7, 6, 5,                                     |                                      1                                                   |                4, 3, 2, 15                                     |   ****Peaks And Valley's .............

Smoking at night waiting for the clouds to pass so you could see the brightest star...  Who feels me?
whoa
Listen here even if this wasn't a classic in the making and was a trash song this video 💯% would make up for.But since this song speaks to too many on different levels the video perfectly articulates how we would be singing this song.
Good 🎶
I've tried to watch this so many times without dramatically passing out 😓
This is Bruno giving props to the talented backdrop
😂😂😂😂✨✨✨✨ smoking out da window

I've watched this video about 100x, but why am I just noticing the 70s carpet to match their whole vibe?! Lol
Listening to this song at 1.25x speed is way better. Change my mind.
maneirin
Fricken smoooooooth❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I've lived thru the 70's and this song smashes the window like back then. Can't believe it's the 70s again...minus the word bitch. You never used that word back then in music songs
❤️
Se la dedique  a mi novia
Sou fã demais desse cara,ele tá a o pé no foda se e grava o que quer..o que gosta...sei que empresarios, produtores ficam encanando pra gravar só hip-hop moderno,mais o cara faz o que gosta só nisso ele é muito foda
I LOVE Bruno!!! He's one of the few who helps others get there's and shine!! Very humble and blessed!!

Alguém ouvindo 2022
I was born in 94 and I listened to a lot of old school music while I was growing up. I developed a balanced but "old soul" and this song speaks to it loudly!
Why does this song sound like the 80s?
Anderson and Bruno are both very good friends and I love them all especially with Silk Sonic
I'm in love with this song I just broke up with the devil
This is the Jam!!! I’m 60 today and I Can rock this song alllll day!!!!👏👏❤️
นุ้แอบชอบพิ้มานานแร้วค่ะ
If she got you “Smoking Out The Window”, y’all had better be gone.
부르노마스 도데체 못하는게 뭐야?
Fabulous, hilarious, sadly too satirical to share with my Special Needs Music Class.
The definition of “she for the streets “.
They have a really unique sense of humour in their songs
This was made in the Backrooms. Im going to be found for this but it was.
🌕🌕🌕🔥🔥🔥
No simp 365days all day and tomorrow
Maravilloso!! 😃👏🎧
Oh! I loved the way they dance.😍🤗👍
Just like they say, “bruno mars is prince of pop and is micheal Jackson’s son
Another hit...you guys rock💞💕💗💗💗🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
This song made Valentine’s Day 2022 Lit 🔥
Oooo they smokin w cigawettes
Bruno Mars Is a time traveler.... I heard this in 1974
Anderson glasses hit all the time <3
Anderson Paak is my husband and he doesn’t know 🤩
Masterful performance! 🤩
Here again months later just to brighten my day! This duo is what the world needed!
Remainds me bruno mars song treasure
I hope they were smoking some some 😎😂
Waaaaaaw 😍😍
Smooth as Silk
Play it at the .075 speed truly sounds like an old school jam
I gotta give mad props to All the members in this group reminds me of the late 70s and early 80s. Kinda wish Bruno would of made a group in the early 2010s.
I think Bruno Mars' songs are very beautiful
I love this Song... ♡♡
What’s not to love
❤️
I don't just sing this in the shower..... " I perform this song"
Why do they sound like the sameeee
What a tribute to our real music... R&B  at its finest🎶🎼🎷
The cigarettes are awesome True Story My kids were traumatized over a death, we were going to #ChuckyCheese #MichealJamesLeshikar died Oct1_1995 party was Sept15, 1995, Jeremy Kerely was with me, He said this video made his day
Glasses from Special Forces, mauhh - Did you know Bruno Mars real last name is Hernandez? I worked with Tommie Hernandez back in 1989, By #Eller_Media RiaAguilarEller 2-28-2022

It look like anderson was a ghost when he pop up on the side 😂.
Golly, eventually a masterpiece effortlessly put together, haven't heard such tune for a long while. My ears were bombarded by "Yo Yo"s since late 90s. 😝

clen
As a Brown (not black but that's okay) person they have proven to me that brown clothes (specifically silk) looks good on brown people! One just needs to be able to afford it!
I just treated my very sick self this Sunday afternoon by playing this above a volume of 45 through overhead earphones at 0.75 playback speed because I deserve Silk Sonic smoothness.
No he did not fall out on the floor…. Been there!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿
l was wrooooooonnng
I love love this jam, can't stop listening too it, doesn't anybody else see Bruno is channeling a young 70s 😀Sammy Davis Jr, with pencil mustache , hair and glasses, so old  school
What genre is this?
This got Jackson 5 and Marvin Gaye vibes of allllll kinds. I dig it.
to my ex wife " i hope you find whatever it is you need. But i also hope your trifling ass is walking barefoot in these streets, lookout!"
1:17 Hercules, Hercules, Hercules!  (In my Klump‘s voice)
Love it, soooo cool.
What an elegant way of saying she belongs to the streets.
REPEAT! 😆
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anderson and Bruno are both cheat codes in their own right, so when they put them together its absolutely magical

What's crazy is how funny this song is... But it's smoother than the Chi Lites and the other songs of the 70's...
I would have jumped in front of a bus to save her, except she was the one driving the bus.

Y'all, I'm sorry, but this song reminds me of this Black Ink episode🤣😂 Poor Moe, he hit the nail on the head about Donna.😂 https://youtu.be/aRPfJM4Relg Blessings From Texas🤠
Glamorizing tobacco is wrong, and I hope that Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak, and the rest of the band quit smoking!  Their health will thank them later!

Yo Bruno Mars I am a huge fan I have been listening to your music for 8 or 9 years now and i never get tired of it when I feel bad I put on your music and just start having a good time love you bro

I swear Anderson Paak gives me El DeBarge vibes with his songs. He would so fit in back in the 70s-80s
Anderson be on the floor vibing
Loves the facts that they singing while smoking n holding cigarettes 😀
bruno mars aku di coret kk serius ini kasih tahu guru nya
The moves 🥰🥰
@1:44 he really did die
The "Not to be dramatic but I wanna dieeeee" was so sickkkkk(in the good way don't get confused)
I'm obsessed with this
This song is supercool and relaxing. I love it a lot.
Gentleman,  I dare you to screenshot this song and post it in Instagram.  Gooluck and god speed brothers.
Coolest people in the world

I love this song bruno mats is so good and silk sonic is so good ❤
I love when it flashes to blue for a moment. It’s like a modern feel then back to the 60s-70s
Shout out to those that relate to this word for word. Yall gonna be alright
Pure magic
They know how to end a song. The whole album!
This was 3 months ago??
Love Silk Sonic  ... PERIOD 🌹
Bruno and Andy are probably the best duo
Best song for me of 2021
True talent is effortless... smooth as silk! The best!
As seen on Sunday Nite Slowjams with R Dub Kiss 97.3 KKSS-FM Santa Fe-Albuquerque from American General Media

Your amazing bro, teaching them how to make great music 🎶 again!!
V have good test ...... Thank u for introducing of this song
Get the memo we can't talk about bruno
ፍቅርDomus Loculiፍቅር 1 second ago Funny thing is when I heard this song I was smoking a cigarette Sad As A Motha out the window of my Altima thinking the same shit how could this biitch do this to me and then I heard the lyrics and laughed my ass off. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for turning my frown upside. P.s. and I did wish for her trifle len ass to be barefooted through the streets.
I would like to dedicate this song to all those guys out there. Paying for Only Fans.
The best part about this song is how girls don't even know this song is about them being unfaithful/gold diggers and how they're saying these hoes literally belong to the streets but girls sing to it anyways cause they only pay attention to how the music sounds and not the lyrics
Sooooo disappointed😒😒...I though we'd risen above using the "B" WORD" in the music industry ..do u guys have mother's, grandmother's, sisters??? You're too talented to take this route..SHAME ON YOU!!!😒😒😒!!! ..UTUBE, you need to Ban this piece of Garbage from your network!!!...
I so love both of these soulful brothers!💘❤️
U know how it goes 😂😂
Singing how could you do this
❤️
re hevi el temita
SILK SONIC🔥
I seen Anderson paak live years ago...an his energy has been consistent up to this day. Bruno is just that dude. He keeping R&B alive an the two of them together is literally magic. I'm always in anticipation for the next hit
😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
la tusa es real
That must be one fine ass woman!
"Trifflin ass" ALWAYS cracks me up! 🤣
How can she do this? Your rich as hell and you look like a 50 year old asian lady with a perm...hercules? Sure lolol
I can't believe I'm vibing to a song about "She belongs in the streets"
The fact that they got the anime shots 2:20

Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib  Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh  I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mmh) But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this?

HORRIBLE SONG
My goodness. The performance boi. They are the only group that performs this epic. Silk sonic we love your music!
Masterclass ! Motown is alive.
Literally saying she's for the streets in a nice and talented way 😂
This song takes me back to the 70's when music was music, close to the Enchantments.
The masters of banality strike again
The LIKE button and the VIEWS should be the SAME number.
Greatest pop song ever?
Yeah ❤
Anderson Paak being like "Not to be dramatic but I wanna die" and really playing dead on the ground and jumps up to sing his part ...🤣
Bruno da goat
That's the music this generation needs
Bruno Mars looking like your 70s or 80s music artist
And I smoked out the window of Chrystal Nixon's window a cigar from Van and I am happy for life. #59941235# Officer Fletcher knows what about Daniel who bet on the Cali Rams. And Darius was forget Chrystal Nixon you're rolling with the homies and I don't live at the Safe house in La Marque, TX and Chris Terry is trying to kill the North Korean dictator, El Chapo.
"This bitch got me payin' her rent payin 'for trips" this line has separate fanbase
The best tune ever 💯
Love this 🔥
Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak: *Diamonds on her neck diamonds on her wrist AND HERE IM ALL ALONE!* Also them: Singing with 2 other people and the musician

“Spent about 35,45 thousands up in Tiffany’s ………  But I also hope that your trifling ass is out here walking barefoot on these streets” 😳😂
Not only is this musically amazing… the sense of humor too is just phenomenal 😂
Cool how it sounds exactly like the same music as Leave the Door Open just with different lyrics 🥱
Stop!! Tell me why Ruthie before your last breathe?! I'm trying to make my books 📚

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is amazing!!!!!
God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.  If you were to die this very second,  do you know beyond a shadow of doubt,  that you would make it to heaven? The Bible reads for all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God and for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. The Bible also reads, FOR WHOSOEVER SHALL CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED. And we are all whosoevers.  If you would like to receive this gift that God has for you today, please say this after me with your heart and lips out loud. Say,  Dear Lord Jesus,  come into my heart, forgive me of my sins. Wash me and cleanse me.  Set me free. Jesus thank You that You died for me.  I believe that You are risen from the dead and that You're coming back again for me. Fill me with the Holy Spirit. Give me a passion for the lost,  a hunger for the things of God and a holy boldness to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm saved.  I'm born again.  I'm forgiven and I'm on my way to Heaven because I have Jesus in my heart. Amen. (please like or comment if you said the prayer)
We don't talk about bruno
I wish they had not referred to a woman as a b*tch. I cannot enjoy this song.

This song♥️♥️♥️♥️ I'm in love.. OMG 🙆can't get enough of this song,have hearing on the radio and thought it was only Bruno 😋but the other gentle man something 😍heading to Google 🤣🤣
COOl
I just got the email that we have the only
😂 1:44 - Paak on the floor like it was a crime scene a few seconds after he had sung, “…and I wanna die” and fell onto the floor. Then pops up at 1:53 singing “smoking out the window.”
💕🦋
I love how Anderson .Paak is just a free spirit on this video, singing whenever he feels like it
This song - this band - is absolute magic.
Oh my goodness. Since when are real men calling women bitches? 🙄 And now in a song? No song from the past calls women bitches. Unbelievable....too sad. And I really liked Bruno. Change your tone or I'll have to change your channel. Beautiful song but stupid lyrics. No man should ever call a woman a bitch unless he's one himself. Just saying....
This two people is done with me....damn💥
Lookout!!! My part! Love this song because it's old skool mixed with today's music Bruno has his own style that will keep him Making hits

if you still listen to this, you're a legend.
I’m a 56 year old nerdy white dude who just loves the sound of these guys. Love that 70’s sound. Sure hope it catches on with other musicians because most of the music today is talentless garbage and leads kids down a wrong path.
The triangle dancing is REALLY nice.
Gbffhzv
This is a Bad ass video kinda sounds like an Oldie
we don't talk about Brenna
*not me playing this song cuz I asked my friend for help but ignored my messages but when our other friend said she finished the assignment she congratulated her and continue to ignore me-*  *rages*
I never get bored of this song

Yesss love it. Lyrics have meaning to it
Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later to pay for the sins of mankind to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord. 2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
this will be considered one of the best or greatest  bass  performances in R&B history.
Maravilhoso, fantásticos.
Do not like this song at all lol

Outstanding music! Such a harmony of sound and Bruno's voice is wonderful!
This song sounds even more magical after I had 2 drinks and a joint 🔥😩

I love Bruno Mars he is so talented with an unbelievable voice range. Yet I don’t think he  has come to terms with his homosexuality
Бруно уже не торт. Такую херню исполняет
灰が落ちるけど関係ないのかなw 然しながらブルノマは素敵すぎる♡

Not many stars like Bruno like to share the spotlight. He steps right with the singers and lets him have front and center. Cool dude.
You will hear this on the radio 20 Years from now... being enjoyed by people who have not been born yet.  EDIT: My local radio station was crediting this song to the other guys, no mention of Bruno; I remember thinking "This sounds like Bruno"... Bruno gone be tight about this... come to find out Bruno IS a part of this record. Bruno reminds me of El Debarge; I want to hear him cover: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqaKisKIyUo
love the natural
I really love this!!! Mad talent, top notch production!!!  Lyrics make me laugh, catchy as a motherXXXXXX

Something about this melody is so good
THAT'S YOUR FIRST MISTAKE...  YOU NEVER LOOK FOR LOVE IN THE CLUBS OR CHURCH...
Who's the girl that they're roasting? HAHAHA
This is masterpiece
mm thank you for your help 🤠🆘
Ok shit
The moment he says " this b*tch " 😂😂😂😂
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (that girl there, she belong to everybody), ooh Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass Is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out! Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (ooh, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody), ooh
But Bruno, i thought That's What You Like and You'd catch a grenade for her. You even told us that you feel like you're Locked Out Of Heaven. And You also told us that she's your Treasure. I even quote, "And when I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change, cause you're amazing, Just The Way You Are". You even sit by yourself, Talking To The Moon, tryna get to her. And finally, you said you'd Leave The Door Open.
Never gets old ❤️❤️❤️🎧🎧🎧🎶🎤😍 Love Bruno Mars and Anderson paak😍😍🎤
This guy
🌹❤️👌🙏
❤️❤️❤️ me encanta 😍
💣
Deez boiz be straight trippin'!  Like butter on my ears. 👍👍👍
love this song bruno why you so good at what you do?🤩
The best chorus ever created hands down
As a woman who is sick of dumb men.... I think this song is hilarious.
Ladies and gentlemen I present you The Temptations.....I mean these guys
IEYE AM HEARING THESE SONG LYRICS IN MY HEAD THINK IEYE WILL CALL OPTIONS ; IEYE AM HEARING LIKE OPTIONS OPTIONS IEYE HAVE OPTIONS IEYE DONT NEED OPTIONS OF OPS LEAVING ME LOST IN THE NIGHT'S DARKNESS  IEYE DONT WANT OPTIONS  IEYE NEED THE ONE IEYE NEED THE ONE IEYE NEED MY TWIN SOUL OF THE GOLDEN SUN AND SUNS
https://youtu.be/emidWf3UdxQ
This is as gangsta as it gets!
The first one oh my sheeeeeah
If the song is amazing, the director of the video ruins it for me for life. Sometimes the song is absolutely shit but the video brings it out of the slumps. But this is absolutely genius both song and video. This isn’t usually my music pallet.  Jimi Hendrix was a God.  But I think Bruno has definitely brushed elbows with one.  Those damn dance moves though! Are his idols James Brown and Elvis or what?
EPIC SOULFUL BLUES & POP ...IM PURRRRRRRRING
OH MY HEAVENS IEYE AM ASKING WHAT IS GOING ON? IS THIS GOOGLE OR SOMEBODY DROWNING THEIR SORROWS IN CHOCOLATE WHILE DRIVING OR DREAMING ABOUT A MERCEDES OR SOMEBODY THINKING HOW THEY CAN VRIBE SOMEBODY THINKING THEY CAN BUY LOVE THAT WILL NOT WORK WITH ME OR PROBABLY NOT ANY GOOD LADY CAUSE YOU CANT BUY LOVE ANYHOW  IEYE SWEAR ALL THAT IS SHOWING UP ON MY FEED IS COMMERCIALS OF HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE REESES KIT KATS AND ROLOS ALONG WITH EVERY TYPE AND MODELS OF MERCEDES COMMERCIALS  COMMERCIAL
This song brings me back to the temps ...NASTALGIC  & dope !!!!
Anderson,Paak gives me Bobby Womack vibes in this video.
Who else here again cause they know they gonna come to fortnite soon? 😂😂😂
OK and ok 👌 💞
Охуительно!

Thisss bitch got me paying her rent 😂😂cracks me tf up everytime I hear it!!
Legend!! 🤣🤣🤣
Ok Bruno Ok...we know you can sing. This song is Fire!    :)
Don't crawl in Willam Howard Williams again!!
Best part -  0:32
Bruno Mars looks like Marlon Jackson 😁
SMOKING OUT THE WINDOW
what's with the cigarettes now?
I wish I could like this song again!
This is one of thoose songs when  u listen to it once and get it stuck in ur head
funk& soul& rap& rb 💎
Anoche le dieron el premio brit a mejor banda y me parece fatal que una colaboracion se postule como mejor grupo cuando es solo una colaboracion una pena pero este año se lo merecía Maneskin.
Mgtow for life
Anderson .Paak playing dead on the ground is the greatest moment in music video history
The moment where they were tapping thier shoes and clapping thier hands reminded me of the temptations😩✨         Best movie ever you can't argue✨
My hands are full right now. One hand mic, the other, cigarette.
One of the smoothest songs ever. This goes in the vault of Classics
If I could shake his hand 😆😆
Bruno cannot put a foot a wrong with this genre.
why is hee soo cooll
This song should have never been released. Garbage.
This whole album is ridiculously good! Somebody slap Anderson & Bruno!
Glad to see a man going through changes for once!
Alguém 2022 ?
it's  been to loooooong! to everybody he's back from qaurinetene
Why would he fall on the floor
I can’t stop singing it
I. Lov. It

BRUNO & ANDERSON!!🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 Silk Sonic !!!🎤🎤🎶🎶🎶🎶 Straight Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don't agree with calling a woman a B****  but other than that I like the song...the groove of it is my favorite

Smokin Out The Window
3 😁 months already past an they got 90 million views lol. 😆
Makes me wanna go to Chuck E. Cheese
Anyone grew up in the early 90’s know moms had these type of songs to clean up to…wish pops came home and played this why he was filling out the bills
Anderson Paak laying on the floor 🤣🤣🤣
There is no doubt that this is a great song... And in the beginning, it was nice to see this young man recreating music from my time.... But now, I cannot help but notice that Bruno Mars has just made a living recreating every sound style from my generation. I have to say, it's genius, but the sound ain't original!  Sure, these songs are new to you young people, but this is not a new sound!  If you want to hear songs like this, all you have to do is look to the originators... The Stylistics, The Spinners, The Temptations, Ohio Players, The Cornelius Brothers, The Commodores, and that's just for starters!   I know I am going to get some kind of pushback and negative comments so I will just say this....One day, when you youngsters will be in your late 50's and 60's, you will hear some kid from that future making similar music to your time.  You'll hear someone recreating Rhianna, Shawn Mendes, The Weeknd, David Guetta, or someone else you like, and then, and only then, will you know exactly how I feel and what I am talking about! I will still give this video and song a thumbs up because it is a good song!
1:44 LMAOOOOO

Honestly this is what life’s about having fun and doing what you love with the people you love
Fortnite -
Like the music, not so much the lyrics. No women should want to be called a B and think that is respectful.  No woman got you paying her rent unless you want to.

I really love their music, it gives you a taste of a little soul, im old school so this is my kind of music. I can listen to this song allday
This song is hilarious! I can't believe I'm just now listening to it. I love it even though it throws shade on women but some are exactly as they describe, money hungry, trifling, selfish, lowdown birches. LoL! So glad I've never been described as such! 😅😂🤣
that's simple real life guys, open your eyes ASP
0:34
I see where they got the inspiration for this song lol...the Enchantments...
This was my song of 2021
GTA now Fortnite? On top of everything!
I swear Bruno reminds me of a young, light skinned Sammy Davis Jr in that suit smoking on a cigarette😍
Great music but not the best lyrics no hate
fortnite?
It’s crazy…. No 1 has disliked the video
Its the guy from fortnite
Omg The fortinite guys kkkkk

Oh so this is how they say "she belongs to the street" in the 70s
Ok so who is David Ruffin 🚬 for real 😂😂😂  this here is a banner!

Is that Bootsy Collins on the intro… Yeah, Baby Bubba
The music gods smiled upon us when they gave us Bruno Mars.
Imagine you trying to quit and then....
Love that one part where Anderson is just dead on the floor
Bruno Mars mighty high and mighty if he's singing about a woman who sleeps with others when he cheated on his girlfriend he was with when he hit fame.
We don’t talk about Bruno no no no no
YOU ARE FULL OF SHITT....OH OH..NO NO👀🔥
YOU ARE FULL OF SHITT....OH OH..NO NO👀🔥
YOU ARE FULL OF SHITT....OH OH..NO NO👀🔥
YOU ARE FULL OF SHITT....OH OH..NO NO👀🔥
YOU ARE FULL OF SHITT....OH OH..NO NO👀🔥
YOU ARE FULL OF SHITT....OH OH..NO NO👀🔥
YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT....OH OH..NO NO👀🔥
YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT....OH OH..NO NO👀🔥
$ .I'll help make you more.if not I'll pay for your time if I waist it. But I think we can make a 30 track dics
Bruno and Mr. Anderson halla at me for feel
BROTHER DOWN brother down to good that am DOWN
My mans really died on the floor
These two fellas making music together is the best thing that happened to the music industry lately.
I love bruno working with Andy, they definitely complement each other in style music and also seems to qork well with each other. Don't stop your music...love you guys

Kennedy soing happy Kannada
Bruno Mars played in Rio right
the no music parody stuck in my mind.. wtf
My song 🎵🎧🎶
Lol, that's your fault your smoking out window, first you paid to roller skate with her, then you left the door open, now you smoking out the window. Don't let a woman or man fool you when you first meet, roflol. So you don't smoke out window. Lol
How could she do this to me? Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh
“🎶Not to be dramatic, but I wanna dieee~🎶” **dies**
Smoking while singing??!! Clearly you’ve been bought by tobacco companies!  Utterly disgusting.  You should be setting a good example for youth!  All you come across now is someone who’s easily bought!  Shame on you!!!
S M O O T H  ~
🥰❤💖🖤
This is musically very satisfying and they capture that 60s-70s vibe, but the lyrics are rather offensive. Back in the '70s, when a singer was hurt by his woman breaking up with him, he didn't need to call her a bitch. And no woman "belongs" to you, guys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTJeD8iU-CI closest thing to drake there will ever be

I'm a 66 yr.old woman and I love, love Silk Sonic. They will be on the Grammy's April 3rd, 2022.
Real music #simple as that!
Everytime I listen to Bruno Mars music I always feel pretty and wanted, this music is the total opposite, I feel self-conscious listening to this, he's changing and it's not for the better. But let's be honest the beat is fire
I like this song ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥶🥶🥶😂😂😂😷
We don't talk about Bruno
I came here for "not to be dramatic, but I wanna dieee"
Currently listening to this after finding out Rihanna's pregnant. (Yes, i most definitely had a chance with her 💀)
i wasn't even born in the 70's but this somehow actually feels quite nostalgic to me.
1:17 skip bavk to 0:21

Do they didn't!! This shit is banging
In this style I see your Pops in you Peter...

Such a good song love bruno and those handsome men
Hello.  Dj. Do you call my attention to this new Bruno Mars when it came in cuz I was working on another assignment I'll never forget and I would like to myself Bruno Mars I don't want to hear that but I know everything has to be heard and then after listening I was like I think I want to hear that again he still hasn't really registered and then after hearing it again I wanted to hear it again and I think I forgot about this time when I was working on and I was just playing that one over and over all day so you should have never introduced me to that which I know you know always going to get around to it anyway then it's just that they're crazy and they really put in salad spying on your face when you're washing them because they're just too funny and all the guys blend them so well with that crazy type of personality attitude and I have to say that all the places that I ever had really gone to they didn't play Bruno Mars but I think that's about to turn around because yesterday I made sure they played it when I walked in 2 hours going they were playing some other stuff I said I don't know you guys have to take them off and play this and he did and it was played I think we all night until I came back to work to finish trying to critique on some songs so Mr Morris really deserves this I don't think they can take it away from him now and then he finally got over on Mark Ronson's and now this the DJ thank you for interrupting me while I was working on my assignment LOL smile 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀. Because it was totally worth the interruption and my favorite one is folds the door or something like that I have to double check it so please contact me. Because for the last two days late nights I don't know if you were there or not all I was working and I don't know it's such a beautiful day out today I just feel like chilling with the music because even the word working yes I'm hearing all different types of anything pictures of what I want to be able to hear that's considered as a day off. 😊😊😊 smile Vivian Moon because I have to catch up on. So please call me I feel like I have a hangover and I don't even drink my head is just killing me 😀😀😀😀😀😀🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💞 oh yes it's hot with much love.
I feel the pain
1:36 that's what I'm here for
Keren bgt 👍👍🔥🔥🔥
This so fire Homie!   It's funny but it's true and the entire message and performance is 1000!!!  PEACE Keep bringing us the jams.  Thanks too!!!
1:36
"How can u kushin to me" 🍃
Truth of the matter: Sometimes ish just goes bad. Sometimes art be imitating life a little too well.
You right he is paying ded
I like how they brought that old school back and they did that!!!!!  I feel everyone is doing what everyone else is and it really got bad with this generation be a innovator not an imatater!!
Clearly they have never smoked cigs before. Smokers dont hold their smokes like that. Great song!
LET ME TELL THE TRUTH THAT IS TRUTH AND ONLY TRUTH TO  SOME GREEDY THIEVES THAT LIKE TO CAPITALIZE ON EVERYTHING TO MAKE MONEY SEE IN WHAT IEYE JUST GAVE IN HOW TO PURIFY CLEANSE YOUR ENERGY TO BREAK ALL  NEGATIVE CONNECTIONS CUT ALL NEGATIVE CORDS SEVER ALL NEGATIVE SOUL TIES DETACH FROM ALL NEGATIVE ATTACHMENTS IN MAIN CONCEPT THAT ONLY THOSE CONNECTED TO HIGHER INNER SELF WILL KNOW BECAUSE THERE IS A PLACE TO DO IT THERE IS SOME THINGS OF WHAT YOU NEED AND HOW YOU HAVE TO DO IT GREEDY ARSE SUCKER ARSE THIEVES BE A TRIP TO DO ANYTHING TO CAPITALIZE AND  STEAL A CONCEPT TO MAKE MONEY
I love Paak with his dramatic self  My favorite artist

Que música incrível!!! Videoclipe icônico... Música perfeita no tempo certo... depois de tantos anos Bruno Mars ressurgiu com Anderson Paak Silk Sonic!!! No Topo, artista marcante que faz um trabalho impecável e mantendo-se no Topo em pleno auge, música que marca uma época. ⏯️📣🔊💔
This song is a great listen gives me this 80s vibe. Feels so good
Keep being you guys You're all amazing and your performances are the best I ever seen. I listen to your music daily for years now..No regrets

Where did it all go wrong?! We were Leaving The Door Open!😭
This song and “Wait a Second!” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through the beginning of 2022 ❤️ Times may be tough but everything going to be okay in the end. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you ❤️
Damnnn always something diff🔥😭
https://youtu.be/FFkCOOZB5yE  Bruno did it best 🤔
When he died on the floor, I  was dead too!  It's funny cause it's true.  We will accept gifts and trips  but, ask you to babysit the kids so we can have a date night without you.  Nothing but facts
Bruno Mars ain't talking to the moon anymore🙃
This duo has me feeling like those girls fainting at beetles concerts. Too smooth, too swag😍❤️😩
Me encanta!!su sonido...y las voces!!!GENIAL!!🥰

Help! Question to Dancers: why does  Bruno look so good when he dances.  It appears ( to the untrained eye, me)  that he is doing the exact same moves as his band mates. But he looks Soooo much smoother. Is it's due to his smaller stature????? Smoother than an oil slick on a freshly paved black top!!!!
We need to start talking about BRUNO!!
Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass Is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets 😂😂

Smooth vibing jam
Bruno Mars has baby mama problems we just not listen to the song close enough. 🤣🤣🤣
Anderson .Paak with maybe the greatest music video entrance of all time.
LOL🤣😂🤣😂
😂😂😂 The Big Band 💗
It might just be me, but does anyone else notice to slight increase in aggression in Bruno's voice when he says "This Bitch." 🤣🤣 Has me thinking he flashbacked to Grenade and just let it all out
That’s so fire 🔥 and old school I think I just piss myself 🤣
If Jacob Collier won't save music, these guys will be his backup
Cony te extraño.tu fede
Some real R&B thank you
I laughed so hard at the lyrics.. The video is smooth
simplesmente perfeito
I freakin love Paaks vibe 😂😎
No that b**** didn't 🙄
Don't die.
Is how a lot of single mothers hate this song that have me chuckling. Guess the truth hurts haha

I came from the cover by Patrickananda & D Gerard
When Anderson fell and played dead that made my day 😂
I was fresh out of a relationship with someone with kids and I swear they wrote this song just for me it's so easy to relate too(minus ballin out in Tiffany's). The emotion and soul they sang this with really got me thru a rough patch. And this whole Soul Train vibe definitely working!! 💯
DOPE SONG!!!! GOOD TO ACTUALLY HEAR SINGING USING THEIR OWN VOICES AND PUTTING THEIR HEARTS IN IT! I FELT THIS!!
Bruno’s high notes are life! ❤️❤️❤️

I've listened to this song like 4th time now. But it gives off crazy nostalgia. The impact is unreal.
is that GTA guy sing with bruno mars?
1:42 the “and hear I am all alone” is so amazing
Just head this on the radio on the way to drop my kids off at school . Had to come  straight home and watch this video. Songs funny but definitely true for some friends I know 😄
The way Bruno tilts his head throws the hand out with the cigarette in it reminds me of that dude in the 70s when he pissed at everyone..and all then holding lit cigarettes in the video!!!

dia sita hp ku hapus jah lah janji....
I really enjoy how this duo is bringing back the late 60s--early 70s with their music. Really brings back the vibe.
The way he got up 😂
🤢
I love it
He really talking about what I’m going through right now
This is what I'm talkin; ' bout ..... like some of those great old school tunes !
plzz more of you guys
For some reason, I think that a Mac Miller rap part would be awesome in this song. So sad that he is not with us anymore. :(
How in the fuck did i just find this now. WOW.   Living their best lives is an understatement
Damn Bruno! This song and vid is FLY!!!! Loving your phrasing in both the verses and chorus. So damn good. UM!
What a throwback to really good singing and artistic excellence!  Also those lyrics are a real trip  🤣🤣
Two kind of men exists  Bruno : Makes us move through pain The weekend : Makes us dwell into his pain
Questo ragazzo è formidabile
LMAO WOW!! Love that their music is timeless!! Their sound reminds me of the Delfonics, The Floaters, G.Q. etc!!❤️❤️❤️🙏🏼
I feel like they talking about me and my kids🤔
Don't fall in love with what you 🍆or 🍑 like go with your heart  we all grow here🙏🙏🙏
0:32 With a modicum of shame I have to admit this is by favorite line 🤦🏾‍♀️

This song and “Wait a Second!” by Lukaz just hits different in early 2022. Times may be tough but everything going to be okay in the end. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you all! 💕
ai papai paxoneiiiiiiiiiiii
I feel like Kanye has this on repeat
This song is insanely good.  Wow
i like how he sings and dances at the same time like michael jackson, i forgot about bruno mars, im so happy to remember him again and listen to his songs
Where's my  bebe... .

This the most simp song I heard in my life
I was just going to search for this song and you tube recommended me this
Can't stop laughing 😂😂😂  Simps cry hard
Hercules!🤣☺️🤭☺️
I came here for the Redpill 💊
You can’t tell me this ain’t  the Jackson 5 beat  “I never can say goodbye” go listen and get back  to me please …. This song is still fire tho 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
I love this song no matter how old it gets 🖤
Cool song I like the vibe I get from this song🚶🏾‍♂️🎶
Anderson falling out on the floor love it
u7   YOU WANT YOUR COUNTRY BACK?  YOU WANT YOUR FREEDOMS BACK?   FALL ON YOUR KNEES AND PRAY TO GOD ALMIGHTY TO MOVE!!!!     2 CHRONICLES 7:14  "iF MY PEOPLE WILL HUMBLE THEMSELVES AND PRAY AND SEEK MY FACE, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I WILL HEAR THEM FROM HEAVEN AND FORGIVE THEM AND HEAL THEIR LAND!"    TRUE REPENTANCE AND GIVING YOURSELF TO THE LORD IS THE ONLY THING THAT WILL CAUSE OUR HEAVENLY FATHER TO HEAL THIS LAND!!  SIN BRINGS SEVERE JUDGMENT ON A PERSON OR A COUNTRY!
He had some heavy emphasis on the word (BITCH) in this song lol. Makes me think he was going through a thang or two 🤣🤣🤣
iconic ironic and yet so wonderfully simply beautiful
I love I love all your videos From  ALANAROSE
The beat is giving Never Can Say Good Bye by the Jackson 5 vibes!
damn...these two backing vocals are dope
Their chemistry together is priceless ! 💯
Bruno ain’t a simp no more 😘
Love this song can’t stop listening to it
This gives me "New Edition" vibes...it's on Repeat‼️😍
this makes me want to start smoking 😩
Love this jam
"Not to be dramatic but I wanna die" gets me everytime. Hahahaha.
im not even in my feelings this shit just too fire lmfao
♥️♥️
The random pop ups kill this shit lol funny af
Bruno went from "I'll catch a grenade for ya"  to  "I'll throw a grenade at ya"
🥰😍
This song was good but super hilarious what they’re saying 😂
Esta canción pasará a la historia. Es tremenda....
They dressed like the temptations and got the real moves
Such great song in the style of Motown.
If you know soul music, notice Paak looks like Bobby Womack and Bruno looks like Little Richard
This is a song that makes you laugh while you're trying to sing along

Well he did say the champagne and diamonds are what he likes 🤷
I'm pretty sure my spotify wrapped 2022 will filled by bruno mars and this song (again)
My mom laugh s ever time I do SMOKIN OUT THE WINDOW
I dunno what's worst. "Streets" or "City". Like...
This song is not getting its recognition that it deserves
So my mum who was born in the 60s asked me who was squawking and told me she didn't like Bruno doing this style. I was like wtf mum... Smdh Anderson .Paak is amazing. Can't appreciate how great he is 🤦🙄
baka matripan niyo lang https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2lOesjJcvo

Leave her where you found her
Megan The Stallion knees ain't got nothing on Anderson Paak, he got up so quickly and I know this shouldn't be making me upset but it does. Lol, let me try to get up that quickly everything would be popping and twisting.
I don't know why but this sounds like a song in NBA2k.
Bruno Mars, well done! 10/10
This song is funny as hell🤣
She belongs to everybody 🤣🤣 go on girl with your bad self
PLEASE, don't let this be the only Silk Sonic album!
Hmmmmmm.

Bad ass kids running around like it's chunky cheese This bitches 😂😂😂😂😂😆😆😆😆😆 lol

its so pleasant to hear
Its unfortunate how men get into situations like this. Its sad. But women finesse them anyways with sex anyways. Fellas know your worth and walk away if the situation isn't mutually beneficial
I never knew Yoel Romero was such a good singer
Just sooo good
Bruno mars is the best 🌟
This beat sound familiar man
💙
These two were a match made in heaven.
"This bi###!" Lol I say about every minute at work

Beautiful Melody, But I Cannot Believe Bruno And Anderson and The Fellas Singing The Toxic Masculinity Nonsense.
HOLY BIBLE--------- 3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 4 neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
We don't talk about Bruno
Anyone get cookout vibes in the summer with your old cousin playing this? But hype as fuck? This just give me old school vibes
I need Bruno Mars and The Weeknd to collab with their matching fits and angelic voices!
Taking us back to anything before 03 when music used to be melodic and made you feel good in your soul

Gente aonde esse Anderson Paak estava que eu não conhecia,ele encarna o personagem espero que continuem gravando juntos.
Thats why you gotta avoid a gold digger
Lack of proper promotion...views should be 100x from current position...
There is a new song called we don't talk about Bruno it's funny because it's similar to Bruno Mars
This is just one of those songs that will NEVER die! Just 🔥
I guess they found out what happens when you leave the door open
Love it! 💘  like back in the day when everyone was cool 😎
It’s this song and “Wait a Second!” by Lukaz thats getting me through these rough times. Times may be tough but everything going to be okay in the end. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you 💕

Smokin out the window great music

Mmmk I’m concerned for Bruno now…. Baby I love your voice but that ain’t the frame I liked having when I went down that path.
Fuck smoking.
Anderson s energy is out of this world

Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here  Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh  Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me  But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (that girl there, she belong to everybody), ooh  Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass Is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out!  Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window (ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (ooh, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody), ooh

Creo q esta es la. Mejor cancion de su disco
This song goes out to Khloe and Tristan
Love them! When he falls to the floor, it kills me every time. 😂🤣
Basically "she belongs to the streets" -the song
I think with the addition of this and the rest of the album, I can finally forgive Anderson .Paak...  ... For that XXL Freshman Freestyle he did all those years ago 😂
Masterpiece
WhITTney😍
didn't realize funk-soul-R&B-comedy was a thing but I'm all here for it tell me you didn't spit your drink outta your mouth @ 0:31
Consummate professionals. Because if I were anywhere near the set when they shot this video, I wouldn't have been able to stop laughing.
how not to smoke a cigarette
If he keeps that smoking that high pitch voice will be sounding like Red Foxx LOL
One word....PERFECTION. 😍
Damn this fully a dis track 😂

https://youtu.be/dtdXC7AOBt8
PERFECT!!!!! this is so relaxing music we need more sirs!!!!
we dont talk about bruno
Ninoy Aquino Reference 😰
Best singer alive easy
She belongs to everybody? Lol
DEAD😂😂
I have to say this is the most infectious, creative song I heard in a long time. It has so many different elements of pass music with the things happening now. 💫💞
Such a Masterpiece!
me encanta
Michael Jackson be like back in the day: Bruno mars is Michael Jackson the new one:
I love this song
The one dude sounds like Steve from american dad
Bruno got the Heart AND Soul for this
I love this video
I'm proud to be old school. That's why I gotta give it up to Bruno Mars & Silk Sonic for this song. Yeah they get it!!
This is the best music video of all time.
I love how Anderson Paak just drops dead and then gets back up after a while.
More please...I just want more...and then some more...with a side of more...
Sounds like a Tempations rip off
No me canso de ver este video. El uno para el otro.
Lmaoooo!!..Looooove It!!!🤣🔥🔥🔥
Thank u for making music fun
I really love this song
Chorography  is old school
Loving that old school sound
I just realized that is the soul version of " You can have an ol lady, but them hoes is fa everybody."
when Paak swoops in at the beginning of his singing is a one of a kind moment - just brilliance!
2022? <3
Ô cara não erra uma !
"This song never gets old. No matter how much I listen, I never get bored." i don't  care if he is buying views from *authentic views*
not to be dramatic but i wanna die
I just listened to this in spotify man I didn't know the music video is gold or diamond so fricking good and comedic.
This my jam but i just noticed they was smokin the while time lol
🔥😻
I loooveeee this Song.  I love their performance in this video. It is funny that Anderson falls to the floor, face down, then pops up in the camera just in time for him to sing after Bruno. Also the band is awesome.
Música foda, clip foda, vozes foda 😍🇧🇷
Música melada da preula
They remind me of the ole school group like the Tempations, the O'Jays, Kool N the Gang etc, etc...  Taking it to a current level, ole school. This group is really Silk Sonic. Loving all the jam's. Keep It Coming Guys!
honest question, do Bruno use drugs?! alcohol, cigars, weed?! publicly
When Jose Rizal became a national singer instead of a national hero. Hehe
LOVE
Anderson Paak took playing the part to the Max. Love this dude lol

How can a song be a comedy?
.Paak is the perfect partner to Bruno.  His voice brings that natural rasp and charisma to the smooth vocals of Bruno that makes the fun all the more believable and lets you just smile at the track.  I think they should keep Silk Sonic going, for as long as it can go.
I wonder what the search results were when searching for this song 🤔
Bruno Mars and Jason Derulo should have their songs played on the radios more often. Bruno and Jason make good songs.
2:44 that's it right there that is it!
REDPILL forever!!!!!
1:44 dead man spotted
Miss just cruzin in my Lincoln jamming Motown, this is nice
Clipe red pill, realidade cantada nos tempos modernos onde os valores da mulherada ta se perdendo e elas estão achando legal.
I love you very much
Long live bruno mars music 🎶 🎵 ❤
I just love this whole video.

Finalmente quebraram o coração dele de novo!
hey bruno! i’m sure you won’t see this comment but i just wanted to let you know that you are me and my dads favorite singer. but now i’m not allowed to see my dad anymore, and your music actually helps me not be so sad about me having to leave him. you’ve gotten em through such hard times, whenever i feel down my first reaction is to go and watch/listen to your music. it always calms me down and remember the good times i had with my dad. ive almost learned all the choreography to this music video, i get so hyped once i get a move right. once again, you probably won’t see this comment, but thank you. thank you for getting me through hard times, thank you for helping me with everything. thank you for reminding that life is actually worth living, there is some good things in life and i can’t just focus on the bad things. thank you. thank you. thank you. i hope to be at one of your concerts one day, ive already been to one. i have a t-shirt that i got from the concert, it’s my favorite t-shirt. i cant wait for you to come out with more music. keep it up!!
He not even giving her back to the streets 🤣 he giving her to the city 😂

Grammy sweep!!!!
Proof that "old" genre of music can still rock today!
This song and “wait a second!” by Lukaz are the only things that are getting me through these rough times. Times may be tough but everything going to be okay in the end. I hope everyone is doing well. Thank god for music. I love you 💚
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib  Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh  I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mmh) But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How? How could she do this?)

"Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need but I also hope that your triflin ass is out here walking around barefooted in these streets" 😂😆🤣, thats my part right that! Song literally means she for them streets 😂

1:33 CONSTANTMOOD LOVE IT
The klumps reference is gold...
MASTERPIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECE
~Bruno Mars NEVER Disappoint. This Group is a Really Nice Collaboration~
Congrats for 34 Million subs
This song is just everything. Best "stuck in my head" song ever
Insufferable jazz snob here, and I somehow got this in my recommended list. I gotta say, this is the best goddamn thing I've ever heard. I had to listen like 4 times to hear the lyrics I missed when I was laughing my ass off. Still wiping tears from "like it's Chuck E. Cheese!" And just when I think I got my shit back together, they hit me with the dead dude resurrecting JUST in time for the chorus. So, so good.
Smoking on da pizzo, say it ain't so!
This is the vibe for a long time make more stuff like this love it it's fire 💥💥
I quit smoking long time ago but after seeing this Im smoking again Outside the Window.🚬🚬
I mean we really shouldn’t be shocked. Its fucking Bruno Mars. When are we gonna start giving Bruno his credit as one of the best artists of all time. Hes this generations Micheal, Prince, Marvin, Little James Brown, In silk sonic hes got the David Ruffin vibe with a look of Sammi Davis jr. The man can do everything
And here I thought Bruno Mars sang most of the song 😳
1:51 smooth as fck
I don't like the new Bruno Mars.
Great song
is how this 30fps video looks so smooth?
Soooo GOOOD!!!!🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥😢😢😢😢
Dynamite tune
*Pov: You thought this was a 90s Song*
Anderson is just the vibeeee
They're bringing back 90's vibes what our parents listen to on the radio and Weeknd and Childish Gambino should've joined them
0:32 1:36
Smoothest way to tell a bitch she aint shit XD XD XD
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die" Ih morreu kkk
Buen
Anderson Pak on the floor got me dying!
sick tune
This is a vibe 🔥 😌
It's the blend of those voices for me
Went from catching grenades for women to smoking out the window alone smh chin up Bruno Mars
My favorite part of the video Pak laid out on the ground 😂😂
This song killed it
Perfection
Anderson .Paak playing dead on the ground is the greatest moment in music video history
Clever im loving this i was smoking out the window too hit different blastin
Bruno mars has such an Old Soul I love it 🥰 🥰
Wow, why y'all implying buying people stuff entitles you to own them, basically? Like I get heartache of someone you love doesn't come around as much, but maybe just tell them that? Like let people live their lives. Love is a funny thing and limiting it to ownership and only hanging out with you exclusively, really sells it so short. Let the woman be free, damn. And give gifts because you love them and you want to give them the world, regardless of if you get anything in return. And if the love's just straight up not reciprocated, yeah, move on. Lame.
❤️ this!
This is a perfect pairing
This song and “wait a second!” by Lukaz are the only things that are getting me through these tough times. Thank god for music. I love you 💚
It’s this song and “wait a second!” by Lukaz thats getting me through all this doom and gloom. Thank god for music. I love you ❤️
Man… Bruno could be mute and he still won’t miss
Linda Música 😍😍
Best group we've had in awhile
Just changed the R&B game.. Singers are gonna start saying what’s really on their mind
Its crazy how many people come back to this everyday. This song is legendary🎵
When Anderson pops up with "THIS BITCH..." i swear that's the best moment ever 😂😂😂😂
0:10
Are those real cigarettes😂 another great 1 👍🏽🙌🏽😍
You have to admit, these guys nailed it!
Big fannn
Bruno Mars songs grabs your attention within seconds. So talented 😍
"Turn on 144p for better music"
Smooth pimpshi 🕺🏾💃🏾
This is the smoothest song I’ve heard so nice 🥵
Went from leaving the door open to smoking out the window
It’s the cigarettes for me 😂😂
83 million + views in 2 months Grammy needed
Who did it better Bruno: 1:36 or Anderson: 0:32
I wanna shake the hand of the chick that got them fellas singing sadness..😂😂😂😂 love it
💕💕💕
Awesome
Everybody screaming Hercules Hercules
calmate kalimba
Love it man, keep it up
The best song in most time #1
I know RIGHT?!😁😁😁😁
Omg! I love Bruno. He went from leaving the door open. To swinging. Singing smoking out the window. Oooh wee! Get it Bruno. 💪
Extraordinario
SOOOooooo  SMOOOoooth!!!!...all Bruno had to do was add a TAD BLACK and BAM!!! Dynamo😁😁😁😁
Difícil acreditar mas no Brasil isso não é mainstream. Uma das melhores músicas e um dos melhores álbuns desse século. Fantástico!
It's 2022 and this bassline still holding strong
what a broken heart can't do
Great bringing life to an old sound, but these lyrics are so on point!  Cut the $40k at Tiffany’s, and I’ve definitely been there!
my mom loves this song lol, but the guy lyin on the floor😂
Bruno Mars songs are never overplayed on the radio. Love the song Smokin Out The Window.
Thiiiiiiis is aaaaaaaaahhhhhhmaaaaazzzziiiiinnnngggg!!!
The funny part is that this song is very relatable to divorced people.
He just dead 💀
This song is soo funny to me loll
Dance like a GTA characters, and spawned out of nowhere.  You can ignore my bad english. And even this comment.
Siri, play me a video shot in the style of “if Star Search was filmed in a Glamour Shots at the mall in 1978”.   Siri: Plays this perfect video.  Edit: This song and video are perfect. Bruno and Anderson are the real deal.
Say it then 😂😂😂 I love it 😍🥰💝
Wait did he pass out tho
Nooooooooo
I like the fact that this song is part of the luciferian SOULED OUT playlist. These people are sick.
Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic- Super Bowl 2022 and every other one after!!   I would take a loan out to see them concert! Lol
The first 8 seconds of the video sounds like a commercial!!!
All I know is those are some short ass back up dancers.
Wow !
Am I the only one thinking it is weird they are kind of promoting smoking this way?
🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
This song has literally made me feel kinda sorry I quit smoking lol Well, just for one minute but still
A sugar daddy's anthem
ele finalmente tá pagando o aluguel da doja cat kkkkk
comment qu'il va Paak Andersone ?
Anderson Paak on the floor had me hella weak
Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die 😂
This song make me laugh
So extra at 1:36 😂😭✨ he really lied on the floor 💀
How can this song sounds old but fresh 🤎✨
The drumline is on another level
I hope your trifling ass walking around barefooted needing grease 🤣🤣🤣 classic
When I saw Anderson .Paak lying on the ground pretending to be dead acting like a goofball I was like 😳😳🤭🤭😂😂😁😀😊🙂💜👍😎
Jogetnya asiq bgt omaygaattt
Anderson.Paak singing "this bitch" is quite possibly the best two seconds of pop music in 2021.
1:43
what a waste of a cigarette tbh but i love the song
He wants to die!!! The fallout 😆  Then he pops back up to smoking out the window of the Benzo.. I love this 🎵
to good bro
Anyone else notice Bruno playing the drums?
Does Bruno Mars actually smoke cigarettes?
paak in 1:44 😭😭😭 I CANT
cringeeeeee
Old school twist with a little new r&b!!!! My kind of music!!! Bruno Mars is doing it up!!! Don’t never change your videos!!! Please keep them old school!!!   The new music industry don’t give us that old school music or videos!!!!
I so love them collaborating!
When I heard this song I was driving my car an almost crash from laughing so hard . OMG
Just amazing. This needs more likes
The best❤️❤️❤️🎶🎤🙅‍♀️🙅‍♀️
https://youtu.be/N-4YMlihRf4

So 🔥
He dead🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
What type of smooth and grown music y'all thunk y'all bringing to us for 2022??? Lit gentlemen, real lit 🔥
I came for Bruno but I stayed for Paak. His adlibs and moves are everything. I be hitting that "OHHH NOOOO" hard asf in the car 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can't get enough of this song it on repeat I laughed so hard great video
Bruno Mars finally got a hit of female nature.
@2:25😂
Wow, their voices blend so well together.  Its hard if you're watching video when they trade off. ❤❤
this is good if there was no earth wind and fire before .... so this feels like a knockoff attempt
Que alguien se atreva a poner un “pero” a esta obra maestra…
😍🥰👍🏾 I Love it this vibe.
Here are the lyrics    Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

This is always part of my playlist, during my morning commute through traffic, which keeps me from having my own version of road rage -LOL!
The cigarettes lololol
Seems like Bruno is channeling Sammy Davis Jr. in some kind of way
don't wanna be dramatic, but I wanna die is memeable. Made some memes of my own of that part https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9537d4pp01k
Yes I love this song my new fav ✅💖
Vcs deviam ter uma série. Deve ser muito divertido o dia a dia de vcs.
Que música linda e que vídeo engraçado. Top!
Oppp

This is a true masterpiece
the best song in the world
Silk Sonic does it again! They are my favorite music duo now.
Anderson face is 90% mouth
I feel for any man that has gone through this.
Espetacular 😍😍
Who are the other two guys in the group?
I died laughing when he stayed on the ground..
They sound like they been readin Hoodville on IG. 😂
i like this song
Mister Bruno MARS a grandement aidé à ressusciter un style de musique qui avait disparu il y a fort longtemps, brillantissime ce quatuor au diapason, la grande classe (à part la cigarette) on revit le "move" des grands groupes black U.S. des 50's, et le son des 70... J'adore!!
Thank you Bruno. Were owned 2 be gotten. Lady of my muze.
Please do a new song 🎵 please
This song is smooth af

Hey!!!! I love this jam!!! Thank you, guys! :)
I never really noticed that till you pointed it out.. But it was the way he got up in the camera afterwards for me lol too funny. 🤣😂😝😃😜🤪#jehanr
Amooooooooo que buena vibe
죽인다..
I wish. Bruno Mars and the weekend have collab
How the 70s got their groove back , its right there. Masterpiece. There's something which reminds about Bobby Womack. In Anderson Paak's voice.
Anyone notice the timing on the cig ash flicks? Lol dope
Did anyone else caught the nutty professor and Wayne’s brother reference lol
This is the song of someone who got their girl yoinked
Black delegation with the number one pick we select Bruno Mars. Sings soul music and wears gold chains, we gotta get him.
Lol, this video is FIRE!!!
Can we bring this style back... and dump some of today's crapola!! Say yes to R & B
"Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need but, also hope your trifling ass is walking around barefoot in these streets LOOKOUT!!"  I Lost it😭😭😭
This Bitch got me paying her rent  Classic Line
"I don't wanna be dramatic, but I wanna die" *falls to the ground in the most unnecessary way possible*
This song is so catchy!! I love it!!
I in love with all his songs
Hands down this is the hardest shit out !!!!!!!!! Big facts!!!!
They made me live and feel 1970s in 3 minutes. It is lit🔥🌟🌟
Bruno is on another level to the industry. He did what they do and now does whatever the f he wants and it is a masterpiece to watch!
Bruno mars really went on singing while he was on the floor like “yeah this happens often, he’ll be alright”
Love the lyrics, and tribute to the old school. The Temptations and O'Jays should be proud.
Incredible choreography
❓
This video makes me laugh every time.  I love it!
1:35
So sweet this fresh new old school style.... Oh honey 😉
Smoke cigarette time music baby 🚬😁
When I first heard this on the radio, today, I was like "wait...what?!?!?!"  On the opening verse when he's talking about hers kids running around like it's Chuck-E-Cheese, and then "THIS BITCH.........",  I was weak. I had to get on YouTube and find this video. The video is even more funny than hearing it on radio. As a 60 year old watching this, it definitely has that old school 70's flow. The suits, the cigarettes, the choreography...CLASSIC!!!!
Should hit a billion this year 😴😴
When a woman falls in love the first 2 times- she falls with all her heart. Later realizes she's often being cheated on. The 3rd or 4th time, she kinda uses her head instead.
Bruno mars have me moving with him watching this video
The layers of production this thang displays... got reservations about the lyrics. Tough cant deny this is a banger.
Don’t nobody know them stars are boosty collins frfr
Shit got real at 1:36
...barefoot in these streets. 😅🤣🤣
the best cigarette ad ever
Que maravilla, Duo Perfecto, Bruno por siempre
This song is 10x better than that first weak single.
😭💜💜💜
Man they took me back to my 70s Soul with a new age twist. Love it Fellas
i just took my vape
Want me a stogie.
Old is gold ❤️ classic bruh ....shivers my spine 😀
legendary
this is a cinematic masterpiece!
Thank you YouTube for understanding what I was trying to look for
Oh I can't deal with this, I'm hot 😫
Aku di gebuk warga papa yang tulis

Anderson .Paak did the Ninoy Aquino pose with a 100% accuracy
The Migos that sing
These 2 together is the best musical combination of all time🔥🔥
the past, taking over our present, what a way to do it!
Silk Sonic gonna be getting a lot of music awards for this album and they deserve it.
Bruno Mars out here with a PSA for men to avoid single moms...
The Part when AP was on the floor, then popped up right on time for his part.... Hilarious.... Love these guys
Does anyone know the brand and model of Bruno’s sunglasses in this video? I NEED THEM AND CAN’T FIND OUT ANYWHERE!!!
This is the Music i’ve been wanting hear for the Longest Time.. They fr brought the entire 70’s Vibe Right Back to the top.
I know they had fun with this video, but you can't take away from Bruno. He is always making a masterpiece in all that he does.
I literally can’t stop listening to this jam and watching the video too ☮️❤️👏🏽
Wow
i like at 1:43 how he just _friggin dies_
THE R&B NEVER DIE ♥
This song got me cracking up 😂 😂 😂
We don't talk about Bruno🤐
0:32 just commenting so I don't have to search it every time
I cud never get tired of these two. They are dynamite together
2:45   Red pill/blue pill,  red pill/blue pill...... RED PILL hahaha great!
Love them🙌🏽
Anderson can sing like this, then wth was that shit in 2016
74 years old and that is badass Bridgewater Slim
This song has been playing in my mind nonstop for some days. Now I’m going around saying “this b***h…”
they essentially brought back the 70's vibe to say that she belongs to the streets
Bruno please keep hitting that crack cause that shit got you right with these songs. 😂 jokes
💥🤭👌💥
Top!! Esse Som!! Nota 10
If I ever watch them sing this live, I better see everyone try to dance along the chorus 🕺🏽
When A.P popped his head into the camera "This BITCH...." I fell out! The line about the kids running around his crib like it's Chuck E. Cheese was classic! They SOUND so good I had listened to it a few times back to back before I noticed how FUNNY it was....😆🤩🤩 Wonderful gentlemen! Wonderful!
0:32 the anthem
This my damn jam I love y'all
As a 62-year-old (Englishman) who spent his teenage years in the 1970s, this is just great!
This is giving serious Outkast comedy vibes mixed with classic Bruno vocals
This music will cause a baby boom during lockdown
I love love love this song oh my when it come on I blast that radio..Bruno Mars y'all the MVPS on my end I got to get that CD oh yes I do..great job guys oh my..

Hermoso vídeo y canción!!
2:47 Bruno kneels and mic cord is between his legs.  2:50  Through the magic of video editing, the mic cord is to the left of his left leg.  #bloopers  That having been said, incredible video, gentlemen!!
Love the way the way they wave their hands in the air when they say "she belongs to everybody."

Anderson Paak. Apologies for this phone. It does what it wants. Again that's a cold song. The bass is on point too.
This is the jam. Men and women can relate to it. The video is smooth. The beat is as cold as the north wind. You killed it again. Silk Sonic, Andersen Park, and Bruno. So cold

Any band or artist who brings back 70's music is quite alright with me. Great musicianship great vibe and top notch production musically and visually. Can't ask for more. I want more 70's vibe. Best decade ever!

Love that they have cigarettes in their hands. Classic. Then when he played dead, the best part of the video.
This music video is amazing. Haha. Love this song
Oh My God... Is that really you DIDI KEMPOT?

Lol bad a** kids running round my house like it's Chuckie cheese lol
Man I’ve always loved Bruno mars music. Never lets me down and their moves are on fire.
Coming straight from the 70's playa handbook with them suites and dance moves. Love it hope to see more of it
Can radio stations stop playing this song 1000 times a day please and thank you.
I’ve already commented on this but I have to again this is amazing
WOW.
Y they all sound alike
Let's just pause for a second to realize how much extended Bruno's vocals are. He's literally crossing whatever falsetto area with his whole voice! A pitch so high that most women can't reach it properly. Amazing guy
1:19 is so smoove
"Not to be dramatic... But I wanna die" (Touches forehead and falls out.)🤣
Pierde ese bigote... :v
Wow
A impann
I love when they make songs together they come up with the greatest songs together  old school feeling good vibes😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎

Idk how ppl can hate his music.
2:44 greatest note of the year💯💯💯
Lmfao! I love it! Also Bruno Mars...🥰❤
Lmfao! I love it! Also Bruno Mars...🥰❤
I need to learn that bass line and choreography.  Also, Bruno Mars looks a bit like Sammy Davis Jr in there.
This duo is pure genius!
🔥🔥🔥
In 2 months time it will be playing in every H%M store
Miiince cela doit faire 10 fois que je regarde et écoute cette chanson. I’m in love
Never drink water when Anderson comes in the 1st time saying "This B**ch"

Can Anderson Paak save soul and RnB music ? Well when other ethnicities have to co-sign RnB soul artists it's a sad state of affairs . Everyone wants black music filtered thru other ethnicities ,I see the game and I'm aggravated . Subliminal racism  we like the sound but not from the people that originated it . Rock , folk , country , jazz . Now RnB and rap same soup warmed over . We as African Americans create so much for this country but are sidelined by other ethnicities that get rich off our gifts . The world would be bland without us but I smh when I see non African Americans capitalize on our gifts . Eurocentric capitalism loves African American contribution to art ,music , sport , fashion ,lingo , swag ECT but they hate the people 🤷🏾‍♂️ . Stop co-signing non African American culture vultures and thieves . @ Bruno Mars and many others .
Yeah AP DEAD ON THE FLOOR for entire bridge… hilarious
Anderson be killing me the way he be saying his words😂😂 SSSSISSSMOKKKINHG OUT THE WINDOW 🤣🤣
Bruno Mars looks like my uncle
Apparently, I kind of like it when he says that really crisp "BITCH" Me: Yes Daddy!
I'll have whatever they're smoking...
🔥🔥🔥
It takes money 💰 to make something like this.   That never can say goodbye Jackson 5 icing and delphonics didn't I blow your mind.... these musicians and arrangers know where to go with the music and animation......no other artist can get away with it  with a clean sweep so yes you have to add a humorous gesture to pull it off Bruno is very strategic.....
if you have any taste you have to love it
Ya talking about how Anderson fell on the ground, but when I listen to this I fall on the ground with “joy” Love the music Bruno mars!
O verdadeiro hino "RED PILL"
It's been weeks and I just cannot get over how good this is.
Is this a comedy routine?
"Hercules Hercules"
Video nice
THIS is what music is all about! I hope Silk Sonic releases more songs eventually.
From "I'mma leave the door open" to "Get the f*ck out of my house b*tch"
I wonder who they got cigarette holding tip from? My uncle use to hold his like that.
Bruno brings the 70s way better than TheWeeknd
Vibesssss
Greatnesses
Plz
Man this my job
The way Anderson was on the ground and then just popped up into frame

0:31 1:36 whenever I think I'll drive peacefully today 😒
Smokin out of window Bruno mars the fans like song music
I love this one. I love it when it lays down on the floor. "He wants to die". It is hilarious. 🤣🤣. On a serious note, some women do that.
After the years of listening to our parents oldies our kids will hear us belting out songs like this that carry the same vibe.
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

Great job, as expected. But i must confess i honestly would enjoy It much more if the lyrics weren't so disgustingly misogynist. I'm sorry, i had to say It.
0:49 is my favorite part of this entire song. "Smokin out the window" filler. Perfectly executed. A classic sound but modern sound. The harmony with the hook and all. This track is fire as f#*k! 🤞🏿🔥
Beautiful Song took me back
The best out there!!  And they just keep coming up with hits like this one after the other. WOW
We dont talk about bruno no no no
1:45 "Never let go of your mic even if you are dead"                                                                                                 -Anderson .Paak

(How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (Woo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody, everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) (Yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody) Ooh

O cara são Bons!
Everything is so beautifully executed.
Косит под " Зе уикнд" но не выходит как то хахахахаха не, так то он хорош, но вид такой как будто рили косит под Эйбела
a little funny but sadly true!
Don't ask me how, but it somehow brings to mind "Float On" by the Floaters. Somebody posted below that they brought the whole '70s vibe back. Like it and'll be back for way more!
And just like that WE ALL Traveling back in TIME
filipino is so talented !
Soooo nobody gone talk bout how they just low-key stole a verse she everybody @ ar 'mon n trey ?
this video is giving me candy rain vibes
God, this is amazing!
Thanks to this nice song my dad plays this 24/7 now
Why did i get obsessed over this song😭😭
Me encantan todas las canciones con este duo.
👏👏👏🎤🎶
Who are the background singers?
old school style...nice. And the great thing about Mars? Doesn't take himself too seriously, gettin' all Satan-worshippy and stuff
this is living the music again there is music like music ❤️😘
The way Bruno and Paak's voice sound together is a given!!! Love it!!! 💜 Amazing!!!!
Not them actually smoking I was like “That’s weird”
When you put The Temptations and The Chi Lites on a song together
😍😍😍😍
I don't even smoke but this song make me sing like I personally feel that part XD
Why is it acceptable to refer to women as bi*ches? What has happened to society? I am disappointed by Bruno.
Masterpiece❤❤❤.70' vibes,sweetest voices singing about hoes 🤩
more songs with this vibe for 2022 pleaseeee 😩🤍

This sounds better at 1.25x
something about bruno's expression, body language when singin "this bitch got me paying her rent" looks so genuine, like shit actually happened to him its amazing hahahha
Great music. Reminds me of the good Motown of the 60's and 70's. Perfect!
Man this album during covid is the reason so many babies are being made. Its absolutely amazing, loving it. Excuse me while I go play this for my lady and get her in the mood.

Man love Bruno’s style reminds me of the old school style
I’m dead smoking my spliff blowing the smoke out the window while this is playing💀
I wanna see him remix lonely teardrops
Thanks 😊 🫂 🙏 😊  4 real artistry
I think this is about Kanye and kim
🔥
This guy's are a music match made in heaven. Their voices, personalities and energy  work so beautiful together. Their voices are magical.  I love them both so much 💓
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Excellent 👌🏽!!!!!
So freaking awesome love 💖 😍 ❤ ❣ 💕 💘 💖 😍 ❤ ❣oh my goodness at 1:43
I just want this song to be 10 hours long is that too much to ask
Temptations 2.0  I was entertained
That first "OHHH NOOO" sounds like a legitimate reaction to what bruno said 😂😂
Badass brother 😎 💪 🙌 👌 👏 💙 😎 💪
Lmao the first time I listened, I still lmao at "this bitch"
A wise man once said: “she’s yours, the y silent”
😂😂😂 Paak on the floor. This song is long over due. 😂😂😂I’m sure a bunch of dudes out here can relate. .... walking barefoot out these streets. 😂😂😂 That’ll learn her!!! 😂😂😂
I'll be sure not to listen to this song too much, lest get tired of it cause it would be a shame.
I hope thiz becomes a thing
Yall get about 10 views a week from me this my shit
im definitely a simp for these mens
this song sucks man
brah talk about having a blast if and when they go on world tour. entertaining!
A whole vibe
You  better sing that🤪
This is not a music clip. This is tobacco advertisement
Smoking hot vibe!!!
Don't forget to give Anderson Paak his credit, it's the duo that's great, not just Bruno
Kullllllll

Ain't going to lie I thought one of the back up singers Gucci mane I'm like he can dance
Probably the best bruno mars song ever
Dope
When what nothing no one asked for became what we all needed 🤣🤣🤣💕💕💕👏🏾👏🏾🎶🎶🔥🔥🔥🔥
最高な曲❤️‍🔥藤井風くんのカバーも聞きたい。#fujiikaze
The best song I've heard lately 😂😂❤
Great song yall !!!!!!!
I love this!!!!!!
Once again proven that the 70's were the best era to grow up 🇿🇦🇿🇦
The vibe is so cool!
@brunomars I want a song like uptown funk
I'm literally addicted to this song nowadays  I mean WHAT A MASTERPIECE! ❤
I really don't think this song would be as good as it is without bruno was not singing in it. I also think the product could have been changed in ways that may have made it better if bruno was not involved.
howww
Bruno giving Debarge vibes 😍
she belongs to the streets 😂
i like it
Gostei demais👏👏🇧🇷
Everytime they perform this.. Anderson gotta die on the stage for 20 seconds
😂😂😂😂😂
Chemistry between these 2 is retarded. 🔥
Speed this up to about 1.25. You’re welcome.
I cannot get this song out my head when it comes on the radio. Bruno should have known better since Grenade. Come on now! 😂😂😂Great song though
Lol this bitch got me paying her rent lol
https://youtu.be/Jua3Um69hyc
I wonder how much Philip Morris paid for that product placement.
I wish Bruno would do Howard hewett “your love to me is very serious” I think he would kill it ❤️👍🏽…😩
1:36 Elmo everytime Zoe brings up Rocco
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die" and the next scene where he's on the floor like a corpse... Just cracks me up every time LoL! Briliant!
the amount of times i play this song in one day
The expressions from these two is really what sells it. Bruno pointing back at the kids in his crib like it's Chuckee Cheese, Anderson Paak stickin' his head in the camera, how Paak bleeds "Gotme PAYIN' HER RENT" together. Like damn, they really mad at this girl lmao
The only bit I like is Anderson .Paak on the floor playing dead whilst Bruno Mars sings. But the rest of the song is real soulful.
This has to be one of the greatest songs ever
77
I love this song 😩😩
Video is brought to you by Newport.
Showmen frfr
Dunno y but Anderson reminds me of a dave Chapelle.
Espectacular!
Nice
smoking out da window of da benzo DA BENZOOOOO
These mofos know how to lay down the funk. This is killa. The vibe is on another level.
I knew this song was a Bruno song just by the beat.
This is what you get for Leaving the door open. Now we smoking out the window. 🤣😂🤣

Anti-single mother anthem.
I don’t know why, but I laugh every time Anderson and Bruno pop into frame and sing “This. Bi**h. Got me paying her rent…” 🤣👏
Not one dislike baby this is a hit!
I just heard this song and I died laughing with mad respect for their talent and skills. He never ceases to amaze me!

Bruno is the truth I love how he tell it like it is. Love his music I know everyone can relate
Daam this is smooth
Ok soooo, I'm not a big super fan of Bruno. But, when I say this song is fabulous.  Omg, I'm crying  cracking up laughing. Between  the song starting off so tender, kids running through the house, smoking out the window, and wanting to die. They had said it all: wait and we hope she is bare footed in the street...love it!!!
we know y'all don't like them cigs try a blunt nxt time.
This my ish
We don't deserve Bruno, man. Periodt.❤️
THIS !!!!!       BITCH!!!!!!
That “Oh No” needs to be a meme.
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mmh) But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How? How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (one thing's fasho) (One thing's fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belong to everybody) That girl there, she belong to everybody, ooh Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope That your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (hoo-ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (woo-hoo, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belonged to everybody) (Yeah, yeah, she belonged to everybody) ooh
The worst thing about this song is that it ends
Anderson doing the aquino pose.

Was there a fake death for a minute?😂😂
Excepcional 🥰🇧🇷
Smokin out the window
Bruno and his team are the fkn BEST PERFORMERS of this generation!!!!....Very few can compete
This song plus weed 😍😍
As mãos do hiper-realismo.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLJ6TKL_e9k&t=84s
Hercules hercules .. this man watch too many Eddie Murphy movies.. lol
I love how Anderson Paak emphasize Benzo!!! Benzo!!😋🔥✊🏾🇿🇦
Take them bad ass kids home lady lol.
The reason why all the countries in the world cannot united into one country due to people forming their own belief. They always believe their own god is the greatest, their own race is the best, their own language is the best, their friends & family never did bad thing, their leader is the best and cannot be corrupted. Once people own their own belief divide & conquer is done. That is the reason why there were so many counties on earth.   Now they are trying to divide us again into "vaxx" and "anti-vaxx". They always want us to be divided so that the world will be always in constant chaos and no progress. As long as they are still around, the world will stay divided.  It is up to people on earth to identify such rule or any leader or any government to perform divide & conquer tactic. People need to wakeup and stop falling into the same trap over and over again since even the beginning of human era.  In order to break their current divide and conquer, "anti-vax" and "vax" people need to join together and fight divide & conquer tactic which proposed by so called "government". "Anti-vax" + "Vax" people is the real government, not "scientist", not "main stream media". Those are group of people are paid to perform deception on people because they are blinded by money and they don't care about finding the truth.  There is one and only humanity on this earth. I, you, he, she, we, and everyone is part of humanity. Everyone of us had stronger bond among us than you think. All human is the same because human need basic element of life: food, water, air to breath. Humanity should not l divided by idolism, belief, nationality, race, government, money(capitalism), political belief and language. If we able to identify some group of people try to divide and conquer then we have to stop them right here right now. Human should not be fighting among themselves because they are part of one and only humanity.  Humanity is given a mission that is to explore & discover wonder and mystery of this universe or all universe. I wish humanity stop fighting themselves and start to find the truth of this universe bit by bit via traveling to inner or outer space. There are numerous wonder & mystery are waiting for humanity to uncover. Sadly, the greatest obstacle that blocking humanity to go further is humanity's perception of moral. If humanity so easily to be deceived by money, then there is no doubt humanity will pull the trigger if they hold planetary destruction level weapon on hand.
🔥🔥🔥
my feel good song...
Thanks a lot!
Bruno is amazing at taking the most dated (but nostalgic) genres & eras in music, performing it so perfectly you're never sure if it's actually parody, but updating it enough musically that it sounds good today.
Got her bad ass kids 🏃around my hold crib like it chuck cheese oh no put in a jam with her ex man in the ufccccc oh no 😂 🔥
When he said "This bitch got me paying her rent" I felt that.
Only 1 bruno Mars legend
Maravilhosos 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🇧🇷🇧🇷
Love Anderson paak
I Hate New Ones This Year I Like Old Ones Better Than This Year
This brought it back to the 70s old School funk Dam.This going to be going the old School Legends favorite .100% flow and beat the Song is going down to be A Greatest Hit of all time.
Is it jus me or did Bruno Mars loose a lot of weight?
"Got these bad ass kids runnin round my whole crib like it's chucky cheese" LOL
Brunos hand movements when he talks about them damn kids and him  passing her rent, you can't tell me somewhere down the line some woman messed over him. He pointed with conviction and pain. But Anderson.Paak dead ass on the floor then coming back to life to sing his part just damn funny.
Love it!!!! 🤍🤍🤍
0:32 1:36 THIS BITCH
This is cap
bruno mars is god wishing for and we got hime because god
their voices pair so well together I almost can't tell the difference, this is honestly a masterpiece
everything on this videoclipe is just PERFECT what a vibeee<3
DJ. I'm. Eating. Now. That. Is. Why. I. Asked. You. To. Play   but. I'm. Listening😺😺😺😺.     Thank. You.
10 years from now this song will still be realivent
Bruno’s music is so retro but so current. I Iove hearing all these 70’’s sounds at the end of 2021.
The music u make is great just use ... in your lyrics
You can skip the b word but I really understand
Smooth sweet music... it feel so motown. Thank you for this music 🙏
The amount of times I’ve listened to this song is not even funny anymore. 😳
I love it
I think we found KEVIN SAMUELS new background music 🎶🎵😉😉🤣🤣
"Badass kids running around my whole crib like it's Chuck. E. Cheese*  Me every time someone tries to bring their stupid kids to my apartment.
This song will confuse your granddad and uncles about what year it is.
Can't get enough of this song ! Anderson look here baby I hope you find whatever you are looking for lol😃
THE ALTERNATIVE VERSION TO: "LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN" #100
I’m obsessed with this song omg 💗
Uma vergonha essa apologia ao cigarro
"Got badass kids running around my crib like it's chucky cheese" Didn't know r kelly wrote the song
You know the three blind mice from Shrek?...
Excellent  Performance, Keep Doing  Your Thang Guys.
👍
So catchy!
ALL OF YOU ARE SO TALENTED OMG
🔥🔥🔥
🥺
Are they a new group now??
0:32 and 1:37 is me every time some thot being delusional
I like that they actually have cigarettes
The ramake of soul train ✅🎶
Man, these moves, so slick af. Unlike those professional choreographies where everything seems a bit stretched and complicated.
Still listening 2021
Good song
My fav
Bruno e Anderson os vingativos na parada
Funny, funny and.....terribly sexy!  I love it!🤩
Great vibe, great singer TERRIBLE lyrics. A guy that believe that the girl belongs to him if he pays for things -  And  if she's not, she's a bitch! There's something wrong with this! This is men starting to behave badly towards women, microagression - that's that.
This is the harsh reality of what the modern woman does, she is sold to the highest bidder, she can cheat on you when she wants to and she will tell you that the culprit is you haha
When David Ruffin collabs with Michael Jackson = Bruno Mars and Anderson.Paak   Love It!  Let's Go Y'all.  And Thank you!
Bruno is the closest thing to MJ , idc who doesn’t like it
This song fire as fuck
i really don't care about what y'all think, but this is the best song in the album, i have to say honestly
Love the vibe
Love it🥰
I love it ♥️
FROM NOW ON !!!!! WHEN YOU SAY BRUNO MARS!!! PUT SOME RESPECT ON IT!!!!!
Philip Morris International, Jeff the diseased lung in a cowboy hat and me like this song.
Groove so smooth and beautiful , This is unique of Bruno and Anderson
Hahahahahaha God this song makes me laugh every freaking time I hear it
Music good but lyrics suck.
this song is talking about falling out of love with a prostitute
bottom line, she for the streets my brothers
this is sooo amazing
Lyrics:   Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

Back here again! I remember I was having my first dose of vaccine when this premiered, I literally bopped to it and people were looking at me so weirdly and I just mind my own business on enjoying the song and not giving a damn bout them lookin at me. I can't believe it's been a month!
Este loco aunque imita a Jackson la verdad es grandioso, su música remonta a otras épocas y hace sentir feliz.
I can’t wait until they perform this 😂😂😂

We Need the Motown vibe more than ever. 😍
This song has so many jewels.
Oh man, this takes me back to 1970's Oakland, driving around in the Impala and listening to KSOL. Is this album available through my Columbia Record Club subscription?

👂⏰🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell🔥, cry out to God to save you, because Jesus Christ died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼. Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. Came  to destroy the works of the devil.  Plea and call out to God to save you from your sins. Please plea with him. He saved me from all my sins and forgave me. I have eternal life only because he died and now is risen at the right hand of God and he ever lives to make intercession for us.⏰🥰😊🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼⏰⏰⏰👐🕯️🙏🏼🥺👂⏰🗣️  There is no sin that Jesus Christ can't deliver you from. So go to him and quit hiding your sins , tell him and beg him to set you free from them. He did it with me the chief of sinners. Now I am walking in victory by grace alone.🙏🏼❤️😊❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼
why is this so fun to watch and listen 🥰

Bruno Mars eres muy grandioso todo lo haces con fuego con algo muy especial... amo todo tus músicas
THEY DID THAT !  I get chills everytime ! It's just like the first time. This is my new 2021 thing !  I'm scared to hear the next hit because I don't want the magic to wear off of this JOINT here !
I hope this amazing album inspires a shift in the music industry. I can't find the words to express how I feel listening to this but I hope for more!  P.S. Bruno has really captured a Sammy Davis Jr. vibe!
Pure genius

Thumbs up so my lady Tori sees this please. God bless.
1:35 This is only part on I watch the video
Many saints are praying for you and your friends and family, I believe God will work in your life! We know God is working to save “so many no man can number” I believe God adores you and each person in your life. He will save!   Revelation 7:9-10 King James Version  9 After this I be held, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; 10 And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.   1 Corinthians 6:9-11 New International Version  9 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men[a] 10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.   Zephaniah 3:17 King James Version  17 The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing
Whos brunos gf
Bruno Mars was killing the game all by himself. Please go back to your solo career. 😪😪😪😪

Anderson just laying on the floor got me dying😂😂😂😂
Love this song omg
Bruno Mars supér
Qera música Tvgorafilms
I'm searching for this bitch and this video is the first recommendation. Well done youtube.
The Hercules part reminds me Sherman Klump's mom saying "Hercules, Hercules" 😂😂😂😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR1UiNdQnDw
Man this shit is fire. 😂
People can't grasp there head around something that is free because this world has taught us that nothing is free and everything in life you have to work for or earn it. Well brothers and sister the good news is Jesus died on the cross so we wouldn't have to suffer in eternal damnation for ours sins and that is his gift to us, God does not send people to hell, people send themselves there by not trusting in the finished work of Jesus Christ who is our salvation and only way to salvation, to Go to heaven you need to be perfect, one tiny sin alone is enough to send you to hell, trying to be perfect is like offering dirty rags to God, your basically telling God that Jesus dying on the cross was not enough so let me add on my good works so you can accept me into heaven. You can't add imperfection with perfection, it cancels itself out. I don't care what anyone says it's literally humanly impossible to be perfect and you need to be perfect to get into heaven, not faith plus works or faith plus batism just faith alone in Jesus Christ because faith can't be 50/50 it's 100 percent and this repent stuff does not mean to turn away from your sins, although you should but do not trust in yourself being good that will get you into heaven. God repented so many times in the Bible. Genesis 6:6 and it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.  repent means change of mind on what you were believing in and trust in our Lord Jesus Christ😊
My and my Lady be singing this song 😆  love ❤ you baby!!!
Yoel Romero sings?
The "This bitch got me" line slaps a lot harder than it needed to lol masterpiece
Thank you so much for all of this
Was wondering how long bruno was gonna carry on catching grenades for these Garden tools 😂 she belongs to the streets
'' she belongs to everybody'', what a classy way to say she belongs to the street😂
I love u chupapi
Cant find AP'S link to this . Love what you have both created
M A S T E R P I E C E !!!!!
retro...😍
The younger version  of switch ..Temptations  etc..they got it
Everyone gangsta till Anderson says "DIS. BITCH. GOT ME PAYIN HER RENT"
Merry Christmas!! ❤🎄🎁
I luv you Bruno
he really threw the grenade back did he?!!
I love the old school vibes 🔥
🔥
I'm still waiting for the king comeback with solo song
SOU APAIXONADA PELO BRUNO MARS. DARIA TUDO PARA CONHECO_LO. AMO AS MÚSICAS DELE, E O JEITO QUE ELE DANÇA. ENFIM AMO.
Bruno is the most black non black person to exist
Bruno has been at his craft since he was a child, from singing Jackson 5 and Elvis tunes.  Everyone in the industry doesn't play several instruments, sings, raps and dances like it's nobody's business!  Bruno is the total package.  After Michael Jackson and Prince left this world, I was hesitant to believe that another incredible male entertainer would surface....and then, there was Bruno Mars.  He's got the Midas Touch!  There is no such thing as a lame song that is attached to his name..he works with different people and STILL keeps pumping out hits!  The man is amazing!   Paak's and Silk Sonic's harmonies are on point.  Bruno Mars and Silk Sonic compliment one another.  They have fans of all ages.  Continue to make music and performing.
Anderson Paak can literally barge in any song and make the song 10x better
They are really changing the game 🥶
I would of loved to be apart of this video just to say...."THIS BIH GOT ME...."
that was great Bruno et al.
Bruno Mars Ik your asisan
A melhor parte 1:36
Lol I love it 🙃
This song makes me wants to be "...THIS BTIHC...”😂 just so they will sing to me🤣😭
Wow
*0:32*  *1:36*
*0:32*     *Just keep pressing the blue 32 as many times as you like*
lmao, nah, they fucked this up! i love it 😭
This is the first time I have ever seen a death like that in a video!!!  Amazing.
Boujee version of "She belong to the streets"
You know all the sugar daddy’s felt the pain in this song 😭😂
When I heard the Delpnonics at the beginning I knew it was comprised of my life's music! These young men are young enough to be my sons yet mature enough to appreciate the music from my generation. Bruno and Anderson are incredible..,you're right Anderson, you do have the best smile!
this'll go down as a classic
Bruno Mars: You know I'll catch a grenade for ya. Throw my hand on a blade for ya. I'd jump in front of a train for ya. Also Bruno Mars: This bitch got me paying for rent...
❤️❤️
Lyrics ahahahahhh 🥂💙
Love It🥰🥰🥰🥰
Man this song is lit
Teeeeemonnn foreverrrr, echo en 2021, y de alma 72!!!👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
Hysterical!!!!!!
This is dedicated to all the fellas going through some bs with their lady. I can relate.
Kids please don’t smoke.!
anderson  .paak moves like a cartoon character i luv it
Can’t believe this song got me wanting to watching The Nutty Professor. That “Hercules Hercules” popped out a childhood memory buried in my brain.
This is fabulous. It has an all new R&B vibe, with a touch of 60's style.
I'm not big Bruno fan... or at least I wasn't, but he is just too smooth in this video. Voice and moves on point!  And was that Stevie Wonder tattoo on Anderson's chest? Deep.  I love this song and collaboration in general!!
Screaming hooooow could she do this to mmmeeee
If this a HIT i don't know what is!!! Another banging ass record
Let's be honest, Anderson .Paak playing dead is just ✨iconic✨👌
have they performed this live yet? i really wanna see it
Thank you again everyone. That track is INSAAANNNE. LOVE THAT SOOOOOOOOO MUCH. Take care of yourselves. Peace ❤❤😇😇
If "Take care of yourself King" was a song
I love the old school vibes
Supreme Sigma energy.
Como pode ser tão perfeito? ♡
In my opinion, Bruno is the best male vocalist of our time on the other hand Paak has opened a new paradigm in music history, a comment from a country of Squid Game
Absolutely old school classic vibe from this song 🎵 💥.
Bruno mars is too cool
I don't care what anyone says. THIS is the best song off the album. I could listen to this on repeat forever
Wow you did great bruno u never disappointed me u never let me down ❤😁.
i just
Favoloso!!!
Good old days are back
Pete Davidson gonna be singing this song when him and Kim Kardashian break up lol WORD FOR WORD

Legendary status
I love the  song
I love you Bruno!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Even a rich man can't keep a hoe .. what's that say about women
Some straight heat man it’s 4am I started listening to it at 2:30am
It's the ash tap from Anderson for me.
Baby, Just the way you are -> Bitch, Got me paying her rent
I haven't been a fan of a rapper since Pac... these my guys I hope they do this often

Bruno and Silk keeps bringing the 70’s into the forefront! That was my favorite era for pop/R & B music
It's like Little Big but the music is actually good.
Amazing song 🔝🔝

🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I love this song beautiful 🤩
Kml it's funny how Bruno Mars went from catching grenades to this 🤣🤣🤣🤣 red pill me plz
Nice genre, nice performance, but here's a thought about the lyric: people don't "belong to" because they are not meant to be possessed, and through diamonds you can't pretend to have an authentic love. So yes, keep smoking dear, all alone though because with that kind of hominid-cave-values you are going to be all alone for a long time 😊.
music,,pure music
Proud Pinay here i love it ❤️❤️❤️
😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥
Holds ciggerate like young punk
1:51 Jumpscare warning
Oh my goodness !!! 70 millions of views? are you kiding me? Wow !!! Congratulations #silksonic

Honestly I love this old school style Bruno has been doing the past few years. It’s great and his voice fits it perfectly
I'm crying! I love it
If she for the streets was a rnb song...  i love it
Silk Sonic try to recreate the sound of 1970s soul music but to me this falls flat. I love soul artists like Al Green, Barry White, Marvin Gaye etc their songs are timeless and still sound beautiful today in 2021 just as they did back in the day. "Smoking" ...lacks something imo.
I like that song but I love how he plays dead on the floor and then just come up and start singing this really got some swag old-school love it
Man the chemistry, class, style and musicianship is undeniable. The writing is so clever and the humor is fun to watch. On a scale of 1 to  10 I'll give it a 👏👏👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌🎶🎵🎼🎧🎤🎛🎸🎹📯📣🔊📲📻🎻🎤🎛🎸oh yeah why do I wanna say  " i told you so "
Hey how many times have you listened to this song?  Too many to count.

(How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mmh) But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this?

The Godfather’s!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

This is the anthem for all SIMPs
Love the humor in this. GREAT.

This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love it, love Bruno
69 million 😏
I love this genre of music so much! So glad they’re keeping it alive
Well, you know, I remember the Pasadenas hitting the scene back in the days... I was blown away by that superb old Motown Sound/Vibe coming out of nowhere... I have the same wonderful feeling here. Some say Silk Sonic is a fusion of R&B, Funk and Rap rather than nostalgia, but I think it's both. And that is masterfully done.
OG 🎶😎
Every week I come back and rewatch this ...this is like my 12th time 😄
Shit que hermoso
If your watching this video or just ❤ this song, I want you to listen to *Bob Marley and the wailing wailers song ◇Love and Affection◇ you will love it too! ✌
This video should allow a thumbs up everyday. I'm a repeat offender.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
When Bruno first came out i said it was a breath of fresh air. Now I see he is the rebirth of R&B. Thanks dude.... i was about to switch to country music
Bitter çikolatalar.

Classic classic you know what I mean
ผมชอบเสียงของคุณมาก...ชอบทุกเพลง #Thailand

This song would go well with some of the urban fiction books.
Bruno and Anderson are one the best Duos that I’ve seen in a long time
@1:37 was clean
This song got 69 M views  Just perfect 🤌
🔥🔥🔥
I got some "Dick in a box"-vibes from this!
The only thing this needs, ONLY thing! Is to replace the snare in this with the echoed snare from Mercy Mercy Me. It would fit perfectly!!
Want to hear a PVC flute cover of this song ? -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RY2dJmYZe8

Producer : How much swag do you want in this video? Bruno and Andy: YES

“𝓣𝓱𝓲𝓼 𝓑𝓲𝓽𝓬𝓱"
Can we talk about how BUTTERY this track is? And Bruno is on such a comfortable level in this album
i lovee thisss so much more than 'leave the door open' idk why this is really catch and wholesomee
lmfao
😂😂 bro this song a vibeeeee
Bruno é a materialização completa e  autêntica do rei do pop ,e pode apostar que ele ficaria imensamente agradecido por ouvir isso .. Clipe clássico das músicas dos  anos 50, 60 no maior estilo soul ,que foi aperfeiçoado e trazido para a mordenidade que o atual momento pede .. E o Anderson que além de cantar bem ,merece uma  Nota 10 pela interpretação digna de Grammy 👏🏻👏🏻🎉 Parabéns meninos vcs são Ridiculooos👏🏻🎉
This song is I lived it too a tee.  God bless my story is heard lol.
Dedicated to My soon to be Ex Wife
This song and their groove really touches my soul! 😍
no fue un pito
He is the hottest man on earth,tell me I’m wrong.
The way Anderson was on the ground 😂😂😂
I love this song
This is probably a me thing but I can relate this to Granade for some reason.
Are just going to ignore how we all we’re dying of laughter after hearing this B got me Ping her rent I started dying of laughter
Motown would be proud
Hi I’m the only kid here…
He definitely heard some red pill content.
Can't believe I'm here to see this song at 69 Million Views... 😳
Anderson.Paak is so extra 😂😂😂😂😂I love it!
Why LeBron singing there
He went from catching a grenade for her to throwing one at her
Exactly why I left my ex. Bad ass teens running around the house like they 4/5 year olds leaving chicken bones on the furniture
The level of greatness. Fucking ayeeee
My new jam! This whole able is amazing. Also thought they had Kevin Hart as one of the backup singers for most of the video LOL
Anderson.Paak is hilarious in this video
Nahhhh aht aht Bruno.... that's how u like it remember?
F#%kin great how anderson just layin on the ground when the camera pans back, classic!! 😂
He should’ve rhymed Indo with benzo
Smoking? Literally kills people. The body on the ground was evidence. Please do better.
The dramatic death and resurrection took me completely out 😂

dude fuckin died 1:43
To all of those who ACTUALLY relate to the lyrics: you got this King/Queen, don't let them take you down to their level and soil you.
Amazing Kings
That's brilliant
this song is kinda fire when played 1.25 speed
bruh! I play this almost everyday! can’t get over how smooth this is, I’m practicing the choreography! haha
Everytime he popped up in the Cameras view, saying "This Bitch", got me dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Play at 1.25x thank me later
Ariana Grande and Bruno Mars must do a song together it would awesome for sure
That's "on no! of anderson paak" hahahaha
Did this Nigga just die and come back on que mid video??? Iconic. 🔥😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Paak's dying and than popping back up is probably one of the funniest scenes I ever seen in a music video. And the lyrics of this song are comedic gold. "THIS BITCH GOT ME PAYING FOR RENT, PAYING FOR TRIPS, DIAMONDS ON HER NECK, DIAMONDS ON HER WRIST...."  I love it!!!💜💜👌🏻🤣😂  P.S. Mars and Paak's vocals are amazing together.
Smoooooooth
This video is brilliant! Lyrics! Choreography! Very dramatic!  Everything about it reels me in!  Love it!
This is so sexy and funny.
If a girl asks for a jewelry or a bag.... bounce. Its a warning sign. Haha
These brothers are cold as fuck and Paak is putting out straight David Ruffin vibes. A+ in this bitch.
Soooooo good!
damn smooth voice of .Paak and Mars.
go dancing....
It was the popping up for me
Estas coreografías de estos tipo son increíble 😎😎✌💪
Bruno and Silk Sonic should do an album of oldie classis..like Blue Magic's Spell, Little Anthony and the Imperials I'm on the outside looking in... Tears on my piloiw..The Intruders Come home Soon , Shemp and the Lime lights  Daddy's  Home ...just to name a few..
These niggas spittin 🥵

I love all their MUSIC

"Look here baby, I hope you find whatever it is that you need.  But, I also hope that your triflin' ass is walking barefoot in these streets.  LOOKOUT!"  HA!

If this song was made back when the temptations where a group this would be the greatest song ever no doubt about it
La música genial, pero queda fatal la imagen del cigarro en mano de todos. ☠🚬🚬🚬☠💀
smoke weed in the room ~~~~
日本からコメントします 良い曲ですね 日本のラジオで放送されていてYouTubeで検索しました
It's so hilarious that Bruno went from the master exaggerater (catching grenades, smiles stopping the world etc etc) to......THIS B!TC#. Still one of the best male vocalist though.
Absolutely glorious!
This that work! In a day where music like is considered played out smh!   I absolutely love it
I LOVE THIS SONGGGG
Bruno Mars is so damn SMOOTH. It takes ALOT for ME to admire a man BUT Bruno got some moves that can NOT be denied.  Just a smooth CD and one of my favorite tracks is #3. It has a dance beat that will make ya move yo body!!  Thanks Silk Sonic for bringing sexy back.
They closin the door 💀
Det bedste nummer i årtier.

KIDZ BOP can’t remix this one
I love the choreography esp the stomping of their foot as they sing 'screamin hercules...hercules, hercules..'
Homie ain't catching grenades no more lol
That was tough
The only artist/band/group/colab  that bring old vibe & we dont hate it....

W have to normalize the gentleman ciggaret pose tbh i always hold my cig with tumb and index finger🥲👌🏼🚬
A excelent R E D   P I L L
wonder how many cigarettes they went through shooting this
I absolutely love the synchronized, sultry 70s dance moves, giant lapels, the 70’s looking film it was recorded on, the giant stars of lights in the background, This song has got a little bit of EVERYTHING and 100% magic!!!
this is badass awesome
My daughter loves bruno mars she would die to meet him or go to one of his concerts
Primero nos deja la puerta abierta después nos pone a patinar y ahora nos dice perras a las qué le paga las bolsa, perdoné señor Bruno Mars por existir 😞

Issa vibe
Leave the door open: a super rich guy spoiling a girl  Smokin out the window: the girl using him for money, the guy slowly loses money

God bless you always Bruno , i really love all your song and it really helped me in a worst moment of my life🧡🧡
This song is ⛽⛽⛽🔥🔥🔥🔥
Muchas gracias Sr Bruno! Celebro su valentía por denunciar de manera pública, la realidad de millones de hombres en el mundo. Ojalá los más jóvenes conozcan la terrible e injusta realidad y puedan evitar cometer los errores de aquellos que somos mas mayores. Cuidado con las leyes chicos. No perdáis NUNCA lo mas bellos de la vida: Vuestra dignidad, vuestra libertad y vuestra paz interior por estar con una mujer que no os valores, respete y os apoye en vuestros peores momentos de la vida.
why do i feel like bruno mars is the reincarnation of micheal jackson?
I would love to see Zendaya lip sync to this song so bad
Looks like Sammy Davis Jr
It's crazy how many people come back to this every second. This song is legendary ♡
This got a can't stop the rain feeling
"this bitch!"
This is the best song ever
Finna hit a lick
gratatatatattatata

Amo d+❤🇧🇷
Bruno going in a new direction. Keep it up man.
Should of let Morris day do that part
Wow.... The cigarettes and everything is something else 👍
This song defines the betrayal one feels when they have been scammed by a gold-digger

This song is LIT! I know this song had to come from a true life experience whether they seen,heard or lived it. This is a COLD CUT! Frfr
For the love of music he protected the mic to hit the floor until his death and used it as soon as he resurrected..
Whoever thought about putting this band together is a GENUIS!!!

Love love this is sending me back to the 70s
There is NO DOUBT  :  Bruno Mars is a lover, not a fighter.
OMG I HAVE BEEN WATCHING U GUYS 2014 I WAS 2 YEARS OLD NOW I AM 10 Years old Oh lord u changed Alot even me peace out
Anderson Paak falling on the floor and then popping back up gives me so much life 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is a Jam . ❤it
That dance moves so smooth ❤️
Ufff temazo
When you realize your soul lived before so you make music from your past lives.
just 66m views?! wtf
My man Bruno went from: “All the things I should’ve done, when I was your man”  To: *“THIS B*TCH GOT ME PAYIN HER RENT, PAYIN FOR TRIPS”*
ตั้งแต่รู้จักเพลงของbruno Mars ฉันก็เลิกฟังเพลงของเขาไม่ได้เลยค่ะ🥰💕
The lyrics, the choreography, the dramatic death and sudden resurrection, the whole set, the entire vibe...all of this is 🔥🔥🔥 *chef's kiss*
What makes this song more funny is their both still in long term relationships since 2012
Is he ike turner's secret son Coz he's the same doosh bag
Omg he looks like that prick ike Turner seriously Bruno no one liked him Tina made him famous
We need more laughter with all of the other stresses we are all going through brilliant
I don´t know why but everytime I listen to this song, Bruno Mars remembers me of Tony Stark. The gestures,the aesthetic,the lyrics, it´s all so... him.
Sing that shit boys…!!
The way he died and popped back up killed me 🤣🤣🤣
Bruno Mars ... Genius. Anderson .Paak amazing voice. What a combination. .... Amazing!!!!
Anthem for the men😂😂😂
É  muito perfeitos 😍😍😍
I love you alll thanks forever
I leave..  they are my property
Jump on them peoples
Love you ALL friends

I feel like this is a tribute to old motown music.
Very 80'$ style...very funky n creative...gd job guyz 💯💯💯👏👏👏
Bruno mars, who broke yo heart?
I wonder how many packs of cigarettes were used for making this music video😂
Every time, he turns around this boy has re-onvented himself, his music twist, his moves, ohh, what a SuperStar, You are. Love you to the moon and back.🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I bless the day that Bruno and Anderson decided to team up and give us these songs!!!!
This is hilarious!
Love this so much ❤️
Had a thought how a woman gonna do bruno wrong damn must be special stupid ..
She belongs to the streets !
يا عبد! يالكويحه يالملح الله يرحم الملك فيصل

What's up mane new temptations looking azz but fr they need to be a group
The sequel to leave the door open:
Wonder how much they got from Ruba and Tiffany for the first line…. Damn
He was dead on the floor and he just came to life
I wanted Michael to sing!

That's so Funky Bruno, love it, if you missed out the 80's  and 70 's you are still on time to live them. Hands down also for Paak and the crew.
Masterpiece 🙏🏾
Love love love this masterpiece!! Stuck in my head all day long❤️
Is it just me or do you hear TLC diggin on you in that hook?  I didn't notice it at first but when my brain plays the song in my head it goes from "this bitch" to... "Diggin on you, diggin on me, baby baby" like it's on autopilot it's gotta be there.
Thank you guy's for real music 🎶 🙏
smooth moves bruno, pity i dont agree with the lyrics.  women dont run around doing what this # heartyfarmily #standingup
Love this, reminds me of listening to similar music in the late 70s in the UK norther soul scene.🙂
love the drag
This song is soooo good.  Album of the year for me easy.
the kendrick lamar and j cole of r&b
This song and 'Leave the door open" are the first in decades that I can sing along every single word, and adlib after only a couple of repeats! Good music!😀💯❤
Bruno Mars never disappointed us with his talent who else agree👍
Maldito swing que tienen estos tigueres! Me encanta
🔥🔥🔥
whoever commented “this is the smoothest way of saying she for the streets” you a legend and you never miss 🔥😂
We need a lot more songs like this.
OMG the way he keeps popping up from the corner of my screen - LMAOOOOOO - I'm screamin
Is this a real life thing that happpend?
Bruno sings so well this idiot Anderson spoils it
can we acknowledge the talent and how fine the backup singers are?? Like Hello.. , 🥴
this just cured my most recent depression lol! im done being sad goddamn it. ima dance instead
I'm used to be a fan, but after hearing this masterpiece, I'm a whole air conditioner.
This is perfect
I love these guys
R & B  IS BACK !!!!!!!!!!! 😂 😂 😂
Pure perfection!!!!
I been sleep on Bruno.
Dang, how did we get from leave the door open to this? That's a jump.
Sensacional!! Vão dançar e cantar bem assim lá em casa❣️
These guys are Radiohead special. They better tour
Hardest song of 2021.
Nope. Single.
Bruno ♥ me recuerda a Michael Jackson
When he died for  5 seconds 😅😅😅😅
Everyone talking about this as if it is purely comedy like this shiz ain't all too common IRL
This is the freshest song of the last 5 years. So smoove I slipped watching this video
Defo Michael Jackson and Jackson 5 vibe
I'm here for letting our feelings play on to the beat. This bihhhh got me
Bruno look cracked out
So... never catch the grenade!!! Or throw your hand on a blade!
I feel everything in this song
"now I've gotta give you back to the cityyyy" 🤣 not even to the "streets" but the whole city
The Red 💊
This video is so smooth. I love their movement coordination
is that carpet?    so silky
I have to listen to this every day.😁
😍😍😍
Got the temptation vibes to this video and im loving it
66m
This Bruno wishes he never sang "That's what I like" lol. Love it 😂
why is Anderson freaking so annoying ??? he just annoyed me somehow
Nugett in the window with Raleigh
I wonder what bruno was thinkin when andi was laying on the floor 😂😂😂😂😂🤷🏾‍♂️
New Jackson five
Bruno is still handsome but I want the babyface Bruno back. Get rid of the mustache and glasses. Then again we all have to grow up sometime.
I agree jehnaar best part in the song!
I came here to see Anderson .Paak playing dead and I stumbled upon greatness
Everyone raving about how great the song is and the cinematography is top notch, and it is, don’t get me wrong, the entire album is a gift from above  But I’m honestly crying from laughter at Paak just lying on the ground as Bruno and the background singers are jamming around him 🤣🤣
This is so funny 😂
lol, anderson paak on the floor
Baby u would not have 2 smoke out the window hell ur paying the rent ❤
Who came here by searching "this bitch " ? 🤪

Thank you one of my song my crazy since of humor Umm
From the fab 5 to this....Woza....so great.
This song is so inspired by Thundercat's musical comedy.
I can only imagine how fun it was creating this song. Would love to have been a part of that studio session Too fire!
Koplak tapi sumpah musikalitas terbaik abad 21 ya mereka ini
This tht shii thts gonna last until year 3000
Hmmm they should redo the video with Angie from Harlem being the woman acting out the scenes described, intercut with scenes of Bootsy smoking out the window.....
This is  good stuff! The hold package. They understand their role and do it well

Thought this was a parody, but apparently it's an up and straight song.
Such a great song and performance.
Una maravilla de música, esto es el cielo, un agrado escucharlo en el auto a todo volumen.
We are so lucky we had Mj and now we have bruno Just imagine mj and bruno's collab OMFG Wish MJ was with us😭
Felt like Bruno early morning.
Ilove you Bruno mars ilove you Anderson paak
That's the most elegant way of saying "she belongs to the streets" i've ever heard
Bad to see them singing with cigarettes.
Anderson Paak 'literally' dies, holds onto his cigarette, holds the mic upright and suddenly he back to life!! 🤣🤣🤣
Havent heard some good RnB in a while and i got it on rewind
HE SAID WTF HE SAID
I love this song so much I learn  in 2 days
BRUNO MARS NUNCA DECEPCIONA <3 PERFEITO
Apaixonante essa música! Adoro esses meninos s2.
Reminding  Leave the door open
They take me to old towns and i was'nt even there  Bruno alwas king
So awesome, thank you Bruno!
Basically this a song saying that she for the streets I get it
I come here again and again just to hear "This !! Bitch !!" XD
He hate me so fake but love  me sooo real

🎤🎧🎼🎙🎵🎶✅✅⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
love from india
Pdhl blm bisa move dr leave the door open
1:12
🔥
The way Bruno said this bitch he was serious 😂
So true, it is the man job to take care of the family💚 but the women shouldn't be greedy, no smoking or cursing no one is worth smoking or cursing for. Cool melody💚😄✨
Actually music thankyou
THIS B*TCH GOT ME PAYING HER RENT
Song not that good tbh.
I don't know if they supposed to be like the tenacious D of soul, but they got me. Love the song and the group. Keep it coming
Just when you think you've seen and heard it all, here comes a redpill R&B song...
Sigh. WHY do men always call women b*tches? I thought Bruno Mars would have more class than the usual posturing male a-hole. I will not endorse this, which is a shame because other than the crude lyrics, it's a great song, music-wise. Oh, well.
say what you will but where was this song was I was going through it with my x back in 2014? this bitch got me wish I had this song back then when she was trifling
dia baring wei hahhahaha
who ever recorded this, I'm amazed you could get the smoke so crisp
The Benzo!..The Benzo!
The dramatics of it all, loved +++++
I’m wasted and this is the place I came to laugh my ass off. Anderson on the ground is everything.
Bruno takin us back to the time where you could beat a bitch for that behaviour
Bruno saying "this bitch" is amazing. It just gives the energy. His movement and voice in this song is amazing. Absolutely love this song!
This video was well put together. Talking about bringing back old school to tee. Love every moment. If you haven't already, please purchase the album.  Every song has something different.  They have Bootsy Collins. Now that's classic. 💯 💛💥
Gonna tell my kids tommorow that this song is from the 80s 😎
Love it.😂👏🏾 Replay more then twice 😂🥰☺️
This song is perfect. Pure Love.
Am I the only one who thinks Bruno Mars is a time traveler, who got caught by Anderson PAAK, and had to let him in on the deal??
I felt it when they said "don't wanna be dramatic but I wanna die"
Perfect hookup for these two guys. Bring him back the soul music. Much love.
That Temptation Vibe & Swagger is Litterly, Got Me Blasting this From the House & Car
🥺 cute
Anderson paak like a chalk outline... Lol
Black music is beautiful! My opinion.
Bruno Mars esta en drogas? o es su apariencia
When Anderson and bruno came together last year. You knew it was gonna be fire. But who knew it would carry on. The vibe of their music.. too much to handle
This song makes me want to buy a pack of Marlboro lights and smoke them all on my 15 minute drive home
The way Bruno Mars came out like 'DIS BITCH-'  He meant that shit lol
when you decide you wanna parody the Temptations but you end up KILLING it lol
This is the divorce anthem of 2021
I LOVE THIS SONG!!
Just got off the floor with a cigarette
Fresh air clean. representing. Thank you bro. Spending time in the studio getting it done! I'm so glad to see you guys together. Hip Hop was the killing each other they don't even know how to get together like this. Thank you guys. Good camera work good vocals and nice chord progressions. Awesome hook.. blue vocals are perfect and the background vocals are surprising and superb. And the video backs up everything. I love it. Obviously you know I'm a musician. I would love to be in the situation to do a track for you guys. I do 20 genres of music but this is the type of music I like to listen to. Keep up the good work
I love how he says (she belongs to everybody) 🤣 it feels like he's trying to say she's a whore but in a nicer way 😂😂💙
1.6 million likes not one dislike yet Bruno might be best entertainment for r&b with Anderson Paak and his greatest they delivered big time !!!!
Why did they have to go so hard on all they're tracks. Silk Sonic is the new mood.
I heard this song on the radio 100000x and though.. eh.. it’s ok. But once I downloaded it to Apple Music and played it again on my sound bar as I was cleaning my place… something came over me where I just truly fell in LOVE with this damn song… my goodness I love everything about this song… Bruno and Paak was the DUO we never knew we needed but now I love these two together they truly make HITS. I truly hope they go on tour because I would LOVE to hear this song live man.. the last 22 seconds on the song is just so magical 🔥🔥🔥
Not the floor😭😜🤨😝😛
this song so beautiful, so funny!!!!
thats music! ♥
It's crazy how many people come back to this every second. This song is legendary
Smoothest diss I've heard in a while 😂😂😂😂😂
getting in the mood with Silk Sonic!!
Bruno hitting high notes while taking a drag, meanwhile I just chocked because I breathed awkwardly.
I have watched this video 20 minutes and I still laugh from when he “died” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Songs like this reminds me there are unique talents in this world.
Yea they snapped on this one.  Music everyone can vibe to, classic vibes.
“Love no thotties”            -Chief Kief
Great group, love their other songs…. But I thought Silk Sonic, Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars’ music was better than calling women bitches with tired BW tropes. Guess they couldn’t resist.
My bf  smokin so i  tell him stop smoking
What the heck is wrong with Bruno Mars 😡🚭.
I have to admit, always thought these 2 individually made cool music… but THIS ISHT, WHOLE ALBUM CLASSIC!!! 🤯
Dictionary definition of SLICK, right there!

I'm throwing this video and "Walk It Like I Talk It" at every person that hates on today's music crying "oh it was so much better back in ____ (fill in your preferred era)"   Bruno just did the damn thing! Even the cigarette went out prematurely cuz of the sexiness in this video.   10/10
Wow Joss 💞💞
Hilarious! This song needs to be turned into a movie, the story is fantastic!
Musicão em pae

I'd hate to be the woman this song is written about. And anybody this song is ever dedicated to...
Fave part of the song is when Paak is lying on the floor WTF hahahhaa
Love this funky groove! First heard this on the radio yesterday, reminded me of something that would have come out in the 70's soul era. Amazing feel! Crazy harmony & such cool lyrics. My new favorite. Such a vibe. Love it.💕💯 #Shebelongstoeverybody.
#KRZYL8T w #KOOLAIDSMILES

I’m not trying to be funny and I hope not to defend anyone but Bruno kinda look like Sammy David Jr. He just light skinned and Bruno is good looking.
They don't make music like this Anymore!!! Hercules, Hercules, Hercules!!!
This video looks like they had too much fun making it
Bro this low key hilarious
Still going strong. Honestly, this song is really stuck in my head. It's crazy 🤪 Still going on in my head.
these boys understood the assignment and received an A, plus an A for the extra credit !!! facts!!!
What is wrong with these artist? Can you make a song without calling women bitches and whores? Is that too much to ask? What happened to any level of a little respect for women? If you chose to copy and emulate artists from the 60' and 70', please respect our music with class.
Must've spent 25, 35 dollars up in Mickey D's!!! Oh nooo!
anyone else thinks this kinda sounds like mjs “never can say goodbye” ?? i can hear similarities 😍
CAUTION ⚠ this song will make you smile and all.. be ready to be hypnotized. 😍
That is DOPE!!! OH YEEEAAAHHHH!!! What a Jam💯. Video is hilarious. Loved 70's parody. Smooth,  even big boys in back.
Where the vinyl release , we are all waiting like 🤷🏻‍♂️
This song is funny and sad...and REAL!
The best part for sure :') 1:32
My favorite line "This b**** got me paying her rent, paying for trips, diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist and here I am all alone, I'm so cold, so cold"!!  I felt that!! Men do the same thing to woman 😜😜
I believe in Bruno Mars legacy:3
Bello!! Espectacular
When he popped up after playing dead 😩🤣🤣🤣 this is one of my favorite videos hands down. The creativity is amazing!!
😭😭😭😭 *Paak* : “I hope you get what you need.. but I also hope that you walk around barefoot in these streets!”😭😭😭
This is so motown!!! 60's came back !! I can hear berry gordy saying "yess , that's what i mean" 😍😍😍😍
Essa música é meu vício diário ❤🇧🇷
This song is the best of Bruno Mars 😎
Did this nigga died on the track
beware several channels are being hacked recently even of musicians like VMZ and youtube does nothing but delete the artist account
This song is very true!!!
This song is silky smooth!!!! Ayyyee!!!!

Well, this is precisely what happens when you leave your door open.
Ok, but for real - when are you guys going to do a Donny Hathaway cover for This Christmas?
And kids these days won't even get the whole 80s reference :D  jackson 5 flashbacks for real

Epic,makes me long for more MOJO stile
THIS........B*TCH     got me!!!! LOL
I'm pretty sure this dynamic duo knew this song was going to be another #1 hit when they were laying down the tracks. I am loving it. First name Roger and my last name Cook. 12/13/2021
Back up singers are smoooth!
Flopero xD
I moved to beautiful, safe and clean Queretaro, Mexico on 11-2-2021, and I am loving having a beautifully furnished  apartment overlooking the city, which includes all utilities, and maid service. It is 70% less expensive than my greedy USA apartment etc. I still get groceries delivered to my apartment, and no limits on anything I want, and not any out of stock!
MUSIC 🎶
This nigga did it again 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like when Anderson leans in after Bruno says I’m in disbelief. And love the playing dead too!  Silk Sonic is 🔥
Somebody: You can't turn "She belongs to the streets" into a song  Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak: hold my beer.
m obsessed
Amazing
Hell yeah 🐐
Who hurt him 🥺
god damn want some toast with that butter?
I got this as a fricken add

Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (ooh, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody), ooh
The fact that he STAYED on the ground killed me
2021 who's listening
My all time best sound old school soul
I absolutely love this song and video. I can't ever watch it just once. It's hilarious. Hands down, it's the very best part of 2021
Emperor Liu Chang: "This. B*tch. Got me fetching her pearls, killing my men!"
I'm in love with this song and video!  Love the smooth groove 👌🏾
Bruno is like the 2nd coming of Sammy Davis. He also was a singer/musician/dancer triple threat. You kids should look him up.
I feel like this isn’t supposed to be a song it is a comedy short.
I love how they are paying respects to the ones that did it before them
How did I miss this. Caught up in them Koreans lol
DRIPPIN WIT S.W.A.G. ALLLLL DAY
Love it
Why does he always sound so buttery smooth
Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak and the Silk Sonics remind me of the r&b group called Christian. And the famous song called "Full of smoke" in the 90's Wow these guys can turn old school classic into magic!!!!! Iam speechless.
big dude in the back killed it
The Jacksons gone bad lol
"Look here, baby. I hope you find whatever it is that you need ... but I also hope that your trifling @$$ is walking round barefoot in these streets! Look out!"  🤣🤣👍
Love this song !!🤣🤣🤣
THIS is my kind of music... and she is it forever 😎
A whole song about simping for girls who belong to the intergalactic highway! Genius! Take note fellas! ❤️
There’s just something about 1:20 that is so oddly satisfying
I love this song
ICONIC DUO
The song is great, the comedy is gold.
Best duo group
Hahahaha I Love This & Everything you do Bruno & Company!!!  Quite a tune! hahahhaah Love You Guys! 🔥🧡
🔥👌
I'm convinced I watched this video so many times I singlehandedly got them 1M views
This is my jam
This song perfectly describes "She yours, but the y silent"
Anderson .Paak doing the Ninoy challenge is so epic
Greatest collaboration in the history of collaborations.
And I know way too many people
I've been so many places
Or which country like farmland country
Or which town I've been to too many
best song ever
Which city I've been to too many
I know over 500 different sources and a lot of places
Must buy this album
oh I just know that filming this was F U N
Anj gaji perbulan berapa
I wanna dance..
Moral of the story...leave them single moms alone fellas.
Amazing ✨
It reminds me of the good old days at Motown just Great
This song  belong to a different Era but I'm glad it's part of mine ❤️
💗💗💗
I'm going to get whatever it is they're on... So much life in their music ❤️😎✨
I’m an old head - luv the song and the video.   It’s a home run !!!
Love!!
Why I'm vibing on this as if i related to it , I'm not , like i can't even be related to it , but here I'm .... Only Bruno who can make songs this good and make you feel as if it's for you to sing
Everything Bruno does is GOLD!
Bruno Mars went from *"catch a grenade to you"* to *"she belongs to the streets"* within the span of ten years.  *Damn.*
Anderson Paak:falls on floor Bruno Mars:My guy you good
what age is bruno?
Someone in the comment said he died and held on to his cigarette while he laid on the ground went back to watch he sho nough did
so basically this song is for the dads
This would make a great cigarette commercial.
Buti hindi sila napapaso ng sigarilyo for 3:20 minutes
I wanna roller blade  while im 65 now
Temon 👋👋👋
Nice song as always but you should be responsible for youth
Playing dead, popping up, smoking a cigarette? They are goofs! 😆🤣😂
So smooth 😩
CONY TE AMO Y TE RE EXTRAÑO TU FEDE
These comments says it all
CTFU
Anderson playing dead and then appearing like nothing happened is just awesome 🤣🤣
Korea.....
so cold..😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
😮‍💨
The way he popped back up 😭
It feels like back in 80’s 😌
Bruno mars the back😘😍🥰
En dos años este álbum será un éxito mundial Haci son los álbum que lanza Bruno a los dos años son mundiales y eternos.
1:36 Not Bruno with the head tilt and wrist hitting the beat!! 😭 And then he points with the cigarette hand like the girl he's talking about is behind the curtain backstage!! 🤣🤣
this song is smooth, good song good video
“I gotta give her back to the streets”. Dang lol!!
So smoooth...love it !!
They don't make them like this no more.   Congs to every artist out there who's not taken up by trend but still makes good music.
The fact that the cigarettes are in the choreography lol 😂
70's soul with modern lyrics from star performers. We need more artists to get on the creative side. Classic!!!
This feels like a Miami Christmas
It's the got her bad ass kids running through his whole crib, like it's chucky cheese. Iconic.
I need a cigarette and a benze immediately! This song 🔥!
Cant help to think that this song is made for Dr. Dre.
This is the best. I'm 70 years old and came up with motown, funk, and soul music. I'm a white man and love this music. It moves me and I love it. Great lyrics, great moves, cloths, Anderson a couple times moving like an old black man. Funny too. I was an old black man in a previous life and its still with me. Great work I love it and don't want this music to ever stop.
I’m ctfu I felt this song 😂 these people really be trifling
She belongs to the streets
This is the greatest modern day groups ever, I hope they do a future movie like the temptations, Jackson 5 or the 5 heartbeats
Es como un vídeo retro 💖 me encanta esta vibra
This shit so 🔥 it don't matter if you ever experience it or not  💯. This is a forever song🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fire 🔥  as fudge⭐⭐🏆⭐⭐ #Dr.Dre
almost forgot to watch this today
Love it! New music with that old school vibe.
**twerks happily**
Anderson I love you
I love you bruno Mars ❤
me: my cat: me: my cat: me: DIS BITCH GOT ME PAYING HER RENT
What in the soul train is this?
You and Anderson pack, show of musics. 👏👏👏😁❤😍
Y love Bruno wars 😍❤👏👏
Spettacolo
is it just me or does this song give you christmas vibes
Bruno is such a great talent
Anderson adlid (Ooooooohhhhhhh noooo)
Now this is real music..not no singing about guns and body part...bring back good music like this..well done.
70s soul is back!!!!! They r soundin like the best ones, like Tavares, Stylitics, Spinners, Jay os and many others!! Mars got to the charts and now he can play excactly what he loves
WHO FINE ......ALLUM 2021
Well male players.. karma!
1:44 ay yo he's dead for real bro
He laid there dead and then popped up lmao! I love this!
I love it
Remember as Jackson Five! Great!
One of the best songs / videos from this year
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
In Korea, we call this "pongpong"
Yo this shit hard as fuck Bruno not buggen
0:33🤭🫂
Feels like I'm in Cleveland in 75' and my girl just cheated
Everyone searching: Smokin out the window  Me: This B*itch
I like when it’s the ending and my man came out and said wooooohooooo I was wrongggg! The ending made me just fall in love with the song after turning it everytime it played on the radio. I hooked now
whoever shot Freddie Gibb's video and then The Migo's must've shot this lol
Guess that’s what they get for leaving the door open 🤷🏾‍♀️ !
This was genius!
sounds of the 70's........sounds so good!!
Bruno looks like he has a very successful cartel
*DEAD*🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I'm done!!!!! I LOVE these two!
Look how so many people rave about a song and style that was pretty much the norm back in the day lol.
I can't look and listen to this the same way after TheKosmic8 video.
My 2021 Christmas Jam!!!
who else came here after seeing the Imelda meme? hahahaha
Bruno Mars has always had a SWAGG that only him can pull off even the dance is so easy.

Im obsessed with this song. « Last night she was grippin on me tight screaming Hercules (bom bom bom bom bom)... »  The whole album is brilliant, the more I listen the better it gets. Hope my neighbours feel the same lol
When the red pill hits
TEMAZO
When Anderson Paak lies there dead and comes back to life in an instant is gold.
This song is so good 😭😭😭
Is that Kevin Hart and Odell Beckham as backup singers?
I love hearing guitarist, keyboardist, and composer, song writer LEROY Sanchez sing genre bending and genre blending, contemporary, and or pop covers. I like to listen to Leroy's Bruno casual cover. and I enjoy when thru YT comments I learn names of original artists and cover artist to add to my listening list.
노래가 미쳤어.... 너무 잘한다... 박수 !!!
Yes
Who hurt bruno
“This b*tch got me paying her rent, paying for trips..” used to be like this for my ex. Got dumped by her and she married with someone else and blocked me. Yo give back my money you b*tch
I keep telling people chris brown and Bruno Mars are the the best singer for r&b
1:43 ✨ICONIC✨
Phillip Morris International approves this message...
*listen, Juice Wrld x Suga new song 'Girl of my dreams' is a banger! Anderson paak and Bruno recently went dinner with Suga*
I like their style of clothing and stage design in the style of the 70s-80s. They sing fantastically. And they make me laugh with their jokes!
Director of video: So gentlemen how should we start the video? Bruno: kill'em with swag😎 Anderson:......nods in agreement  Director:......well aright then Video 0:11
0:32
Damn she ain't even for the streets she for the city XD
Dis bitch got me paying her rent , as he leans to da side with his cigarette😂🔥
A Golden Award for u ,u did it again❤️silk Sonic,Brono Mars,since I heard your first song years back 👌I knew u a Boss❤️until now and onwards
Hey Bruno mars It's Me Monce i'm 17 Years Old I Love Your Music Videos And You Making a lyrics and that's it!!!! -Monce villauneva-nava i will Buy a Cd Of You and Your Best Friends and your Band and Yeah That's It I Do Remembered Of U!!!!!!!!!!!
I love how this music video has both Anderson and Bruno sharing the center stage. They compliment each other so well. 😍
wow!
This is hilarious!
Bruno mars saying "this Bitch" is oddly satisfying
When is Bruno and The Weeknd gonna collab? Get daft punk on the project too and make some super funky club music.
HELLO MY BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, I REALLY LIKE THE SOUND BUT BRUNO MARS AND SILK SONIC HAVE TO MUCH CLASS OF FANS AND THEIR SOUND ARE JUST TO CLASSY TO SING SUCH JUNK CALLING FEMALES ( BITCH) BUT I'M STILL A FAN OF SOME GOOD SONGS THAT HE HAS, I JUST CAN'T SEE THEM BELITTLING WOMEN LIKE THAT, NOT KOOL @  ALL THATS WHAT I THINK & SAY ( TOOO CLASSY) FOR SAVING OR CALLING WOMEN THAT POINT BLANK AND THE PERIOD 🆗️ MSCANDILASTNAMEDIVA👑👑
I am 65 but love me some Bruno Mars and Sonic Silk. Love where they are right now. Smoking Out The Window is funny as ever!
62
Shoutout to all of you lovely people smoking out the window listening to this right now, your time is gonna come❤️
This shit is a fucking classic
the new michael jackson
this is phenomenal
Don't get me wrong this is good but Bruno Mars should make his solo songs.
My song!!!! Love the entire cd
Parabéns músicas lindas e os dois estão lindos cantando juntos amo ouvir suas musicas
This is the nicest way to say that someone is for the streets.
.
Damn 🥰⏳
😍😍😍😍😍
“Now I got to give you back to the city!” Translation: She belongs to the streets!
Bro! This is the type of vibe we grew up on. Damn that’s dope how current artists are paying respects to the music they grew up on and making their own new music inspired by it 🙏🏽💯
Not 1 dislike.......  Sounds like we got another 1 😍
Esto me hace recordar bandas como The Manhattans, o The Chi-lites, la coreografía, el coro me encanta!!! 😍🤩 y también me remonta a canciones románticas o de despecho como las de Boyz II men, este dueto de Bruno Mars y Anderson Paak, simplemente me fascina!!! 👏👏👏👏🥰💗💞
My go to…..everyday😊
Tell me why the F did I just get a dijavo of this song??
These are the coolest men ever💯💯💯
This is THE jam!!
0:46 LITERAL CHILLS!!!
This song is the best
choreo credits to michael jacksons girl paris and boy blanket?
Do u know how much I've had waiting for new music :'( I'm crying but I love u daaaaaaam it <3 love u from Ecuador
Damn
Bruno Bruno Bruno..doesnt give a f#k about charts or whatever billboard bullshit...theses homies just enjoying life n good music💯❤️
Damn the high note like sheeesh
Every "man" feels this lick... because we been "there".
Didn't need YouTube to recommend, I searched for this piece of art.
I love the vibe of this song
Anybody else have this as their ring tone?
Paak's comedic timing is on point lol
Bro I'm 31 and this beat gots me thinking about growing up in 90s  Grandma chillin outside playing oldies smoking a joint 💯
Lly <3
This song slaps! Reminds me of the last one. I just know the next one is going to be way better!
She was basically the Town Bicycle, I hope her trifling ass losses air in those tires🤣
This is the men's reaction to the 1980s classic "Ain't Nothing Going On But The Rent."
This is what kids call today “She belongs to the streets.”
1:45 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best song of the year
I can’t tell is this songs real or just one huge joke
Ok I love how this song sounds, love the dancing, it’s such a cool vibe…. BUT I’m so bothered by calling her “this bitch” and talking about who she “belongs” to. It feels a little too misogynistic even if it’s meant to be funny? Anyone else feeling this??
so no one is going to talk about how the drummer looks like bruno mars from the past
I love this group but it was displayed very poor judgement to glamorize cigarette smoking. I thought mainstream media was over this. The kids seeing this will say "hey this is such a cool thing to be doing" I want to be like them. Had to hit dislike on this song even though YouTube hides it now. How convenient. I have been harmed by second hand smoke growing up with a 3 pack a day smoker at home. This group need to display better judgment going forward or I will shun them forever. I know it doesn't really matter to them but just saying to anyone else that feels the same as me.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
la classe !!!! j'adore
🤍🤍🤍🤍
yesss bruno
kamu keren sekaliii
All I see is E. Panda ♥
Looking at them dance is so satisfying
My little granddaughter who is 4 loves Bruno🥰

But Bruno’s high note tho
This song is a total addiction!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn I love this duo bruno mars and anderson ❤️
If this song is relatible you need to change that shit.
This is the red pill anthem 🤣
The Chucky Cheese part cracks me up everytime lol
This song is fire 🔥🔥 I'm thankful to the bitch that got him paying her rent!
This is one classic 🚬 song
It's probably the same girl that he sung that's what I like too... If it was it would make the song a lot funnier
In love  with your  songs  like  always ♡♡♡♡♡
I don't think anyone will see this, but if you have music recommendations in this style please leave a comment under here! ❤
I'm glad to have stumbled upon a post that tagged them on Facebook. This band is bringing back the livelier 70s vibes with their funk, soul, rnb & disco music like what Dua Lipa was doing. Or should we call this Post-Motown? I hope some other artists follow their footsteps
Take this Red Pill fellas, and never, never, enter in a relationship with an MSOL
Grammy nominee🔥🔥🔥
I had to relay it that’s crazy 🔥🔥🔥
This a vibe bring back that old school sound ❤️❤️❤️
This joint has the same feel & vibe as Commodors  Fall 1976 hit, Just 2 Be Close 2 U
Me after any minor inconvenience in my life @1:33
Only good vibes!!
such a SUAVE music video..
❤️❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋💋💋💟💟💟💟💟
Tell the truth lady's breaking hearts
The most legendary duo to date
Bruno Mars looks like he's been hanging with the wrong crowd
What a unique sound¡¡¡ I love this song ❤
A great performance that Dave Chapelle himself would approve! haha Smokin' while performin'.
Soty
anderson actually died lmao
Screaming Hercules!
Daaaaaaamn!
Some king music here ..let the 403s know
this is clean af
"Now I gotta give you back to the ciiiiityyyyy! = she's for the streets!
This shit fucking rules
I suggest you become one band....I like the combo 😆
I hate golddiggers
Watching in 144p to get those old school feels
I like the way they are holding cigarettes to the end.
This hits different
Nice, really cool sound
Top-notch lyrics
He gave her back to the city not just the streets LMAO!!!!
Tem um fenômeno acontecendo e poucas pessoas aqui no Brasil estão prestando atenção, essa dupla Mars e Paak estão fazendo uma história linda na música!

Best version of she belongs to the streets i've ever heard in my life
I am leaving this comment here in hope that whenever someone likes it, I'll be reminded of this masterpiece.....
Lyrics  Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (that girl there, she belong to everybody), ooh Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass Is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out! Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (ooh, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody), ooh

Wow, love this 70's type Soul Train collaboration, dance routine - now this is Music, romantic, has a dance grove - someone still knows how to market to All types of music Lovers!! Wow is all I have to say!!
Dude staying on the floor after he "dies". LOL every time. And Bruno's voice is so goddamned GOOD!
マイケル・ジャクソン?といぅと、違和感はありますがーどこかで聴いたことがあるー！バックの音 ７０年代の音?かな〜
The choreography is fire 🔥
This is so entertaining to watch .

This song blows… enough with the 70s porn music  parodies , shits whack.

i think we must thank this girl for letting Bruno mar singing this masterpiece <3
DAMNNN. THIS SONG IS A "B.O.P!" soo SMMOOOTTHH

이런 장르가 컨셉으로 느껴지지 않아 그냥 찐으로 좋아서 하는 일상 브이로그 같은 느낌

Fire.. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just heard this in the morning and I swear I've had this play all day on repeat in the car while running around doing errands... for honestly 2 reasons;  1. Can't frkn get enough of the groove 😩  2. Giving it some love with Views 😌
This song is hilarious
I am that's b*tch who get heartbroken by that's old mannnnnnnnn
It’s already been a month since this masterpiece came out😭😭
the fact that paak is now on gta online is just great
Harry Winston!!!❤️❤️ LMAFO
Luv from Haïti
That what I'm been doing
I took my little nephew’s, and niece’s, to Chucky E. Cheese. They had a good 👍 time.   Tiffany’s is very good designer  jewelry. Nothing is wrong, with the UFC, my brother is a fan.
This song is the smoothest disrespectful song since Billie Jean
Okay 👍  Mama’s Boy!!! Diaperman  Do you need a bottle? LMAFO
Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars are both genious. All these musicians created a piece of jewelry, really! After watching the video I stood up to clap...  it's no joke
🔥🔥
Elvis still number #1  LOL
Don’t you have a Girlfriend?                           LMFAO
Pensé que lo habían invitado al Show de las estrellas de Jorge Barón Televisión Jajajajaja solo los Colombianos viendo esto lo entenderán jajajjajaja.
This is untouchable. Sweet Lord is this ever excellence and utter genius. Just wow.
This B**** .... 🤣🤣
Relatable for all simps around the world... 🤪
Singing to myself.."He belongs to everybody!"....😭😭😭😭
sammy davis jr😂
honestly cant stand this
Favoritku di radio
0:21 me when I run to my room to escape the family gathering but see some one's random baby on my bed
The way Anderson Paak just popped back up out of nowhere gets me EVERY time!😂🤣
"You wished you closed that door now, don't you?!"😂🤣
"Who hurt y'all?"😂🤣
This is the smoothest diss track I've ever heard.
The way that Anderson had lyrically said, "Not to be dramatic but I wanna die" then one second later you see him on the ground and then a few seconds afterwards he pops back up into the camera, that was a speedy recovery!😂😂😂😂😂
Paak being a Drama Queen about his pain, makes me giggle. We all felt like  it. Love this modern take on a groove that just works. Always will.🐨🦘
Amo amo amooooo
LOVE this song 🎶 Gets me in a happy mood thru these tough times!
this song makes me wanna drive late at night and just smoke lmao
Paak on the floor 🤣🤣🤣
No class!!!
LOL Dog 🐕!!!
This song is funny as hell
Great song, but why does Anderson .Paak look like Yoel Romero's little brother?
Damn!
I like how this sounds like a love song but the lyrics just describe modern day women and why men don't want to deal with yall.
it's really amazing, i have a new addiction.
Looking handsome Bruno
Luv this Bruno
Beat song ever
Posso ouvir mil vezes e não me cansar. O ritmo é contagiante
I love bruno
Why is he on the floor
Every time Anderson pops off the ground it’s got me dying lmfao, I love this video
It's the "Ssssmokin'-out-da-windoooow" for me.
Blasting this song into my head while my mom and sister are yelling at each other is kind of a vibe :)
they were doing the fortnite dance *leave the door open*
These 2  are soulmates.
I love it 😀 😍 ❤
Toooo great
Pure comic art 🤗🤗🤗💚🤍🧡
I have listen to this song 5-6 times. Like it so much 🤣 I can hit Bruno's high note exactly like him. I use another word for The " B" word 😂😂😂😂🤣.
Fdss
Épico
I must be about half of these views, because I can NOT stop replaying this.
Soul vibes are the most deepest. WOW! Love this. Is it me, or does it seem that the smallest people in life have the biggest success?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We have just stepped into another dimensional portal..I love how this sound makes us soo happy!!  shhhmokin out the window bb!
Idk why this reminds me of wildn out free style 😅😅
Okay so when we all get old there gonna be remembered as the group who had us looking at are woman like Bitch lmfao
is anderson paak dead or... (1:44)
& it's iconic
This the mf Rath of da City Girl anthem😂😂
Ok. Who did burnt Bruno Mars?
Seems like the smokin word in the title has little to do with the point of the song and sends a backward visual message.  Quitting cigarette smoking can take decades and so I’m not down with this prop.  Little kids love these guys 🙏🏾
Can we please get a Christmas album?
Funky music as I ever like..! Soul and Heart waooo. It's make me "something"...
This song gives me such old vibes I have missed for a while glad this was made
I. AM. Obsessed with this song!
Bruno said " let me leave & let somebody else take album of da year so that I can get it right back
This is why i like bruno He just enjoy as a singer and do what he loves the most without thinkin about trophy 😁
Bad Azz kids running around like it's Chunky Cheese 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😄
Baaad Azz Silk Sonic 👍💯👏👏👏👑👑👑👑👑💜💜💜 Bruno Mars always been a favorite singer of mine. Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak, Silk Sonic 👍💯✊
and I thought Fly Like Me was funny. I might have to cough up some actual cash and buy this whole album.
Of course ive got the album on repeat but its the first time ive seen this video... genius gents... GENIUS!
Bruno came from "I'd catch a grenade for ya" to "DIS BITCH". Boy talk about character development.
Souls Back Yeeeeej
Now I am smoking in the bedroom my right now 🙄
I want one of those swanky suits.
Well you left the door open for her....
This is THE driving to/from work track. Full stop.
This is gold!! Funny but a classic!!
Masterpiece... This song deserve more views...
Best song for me
I don't smoke but this song make me wanna light a cigarette and jam into this music
It makes me happy that this master piece got no dislikes <3
无限循环
Everybody thinks it's funny when he dies...I think it's funnier when he pops back up 🤣
Step Daddys and Simps with money, this song's for you🍻 🤣👌🏿
I've never heard a collaboration that sounds more like each respective artist's unique sound, each song on the album sounds as much like a Paak song as it does classic Bruno mars which is a real testament to their chemistry. My top album of 2021
same vibes as Walk it, Talk it mv
Some of the lyrics are so funny, but such a nice groove!

🤣🤣🤣🤣 Why He Pop Up Off The Floor Like That 🤣🤣🤣
So this song is the aftermath of what happened on the song "That's what I like"?
When the red pill spreads in pop music 😂
Im crazy addicted to your music
Give her back to the streets
Dope
From BC Canada it's trip styles with his single take off! He's taking off to Chucky Cheese to chachachuhhh https://youtu.be/24eGzBfabYc
1:35 🔥
This track connects generations what a time
Nth time playing this cos this deserves more views. 🔥🔥
Smokin' out the window  ............
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new meme.
Bruno I loveeeee this song🥰 but how you smoking out the window & leaving the door open? 😂😂
The way they dance is like CGI dancing
Every time I come back to this video I remember how good the editing is
We need music like this. Brings back so much..
I dunno but--- Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak, and Silk Sonic is just givin' me the Jackson 5 70s vibe in this album
Bruno vocals are so clean
I find the funniest part is that these guys are holding their cigs wrong. Don’t smoke, but I’ve been around enough to know full well true smokers never hold their cigarettes between their index finger and thumb.
The moment you subconsiously vibe with all his tracks and find yourself actually obsessed with him! 🧚‍♂️
Anderson with the dropping dead was crazy, and still holding the cigarette was on some new level james brown shit! Fo Real
the serotonin this video gives me
Talk about die laughing seeing Paak on the ground playing dead. I nearly lost it hahahaha f’en classic
no puedo dejar de escuchar esta cancionn marrrdita seaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa xD
#APREME
Bruno mars and Justin Bieber they don't care the rankings! They chilling
I just now noticed, they all had cigarettes in their hands lol
I love it👏👏👏👏🤣
Best song ever about single moms not being worth the trouble
I alone contributed 10 million views to this video.
Who hurt Bruno
2:58 Bruno's chin angle is perfect
This song is resonating with me! This is what I'm going thru at the moment. Peace and blessings to everybody going thru the temporary pains of life.  Stay strong and true to yourself. It has to get better!
Grown folks music 👌
If "she belongs to the streets" was a song
My idol brunooo

Bruno is putting out Sammy Davis Jr. vibes.
Bruno is basically taking us through the decades with the music he's been making the last 5 yrs or so... I'm not complaining. 💕  We couldn't have asked for a better team-up. ✨🕶️🎤🎵🕺🏻🕺🏽🎶🎤✨
Sooooooooo smooth🥰🥰🥰🥰😘
That "trifling ass" comment had me laughing
IMELDA MARCOS YARN???
2:20 OHH NOO
I love it how it sounds even better live.
Hercules Hercules lol
https://youtu.be/POuFQYN4a1Q
Got this song as an ad when it first came out. Literally the only ad I've not skipped. Not even mad that they promoted it like that, 🔥🔥🔥
How did they get the sound so warm, I’m assuming they used one of those digital recording software, but the sound has that 70s 80s feel, maybe it is because they didn’t abuse auto tune. Big ups to the engineer for capturing this and mixing it this way.
Love love love ❤️
She belongs to the streets.mp4
Bruno saying "Th bitch!" I felt it and the movements made it so much better like she hurt that man😂😭😂
Basically my guys when your girl trippin just hotbox 😂
So we finally know what an album would have been like if Bobby Womack did an album with Bobby Debarge
😭😭😭 I know a couple real ones who been there and few others still “Smoking out the windowww” #freethebros 😭😭😭😭
He said CHUCKYCHEESE now I know he’ll say anything
It's crazy how many people are cames back to these all everyday .This song is legendar. y♪
It's crazy how many people come back to this everyday.This song is legendary ♪

So he just gone fall and get back up like nothing happened

Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist but no diamonds on her ring finger… I see the issue clear

"Just the other night, she was gripping on me tight, screaming Hercules!!! Hercules.. Hercules" (with the beat & foot stomps in unison) 🤣🤣🤣 🎵 CLASSIC 🎵 💯 😎
Anthem of a married man

Bruno Mars challenging BTS with those sick dance moves
💘🍀💘🍀💘🍀💘🍀💘🍀💘🍀💘🍀💘🍀
1:33 - 1:36
Bravo bravo outstanding
Truly a song of our times.
fuck ! this is bop ! i love this !
The way he keep popping up 😂
“Just the other night she was grippin’ on me tight, screaming Hercules “
The chorus of this song definitely sounds like something Bruno mars would write/sing especially the part where the song goes “oh I thought that she belonged to only meeeeee”
The best part of the song when Paak comes into frame with the incredible “THIS. BITCH. got me payin her rent…” is so damn good not only cuz the lyrics but the delivery of it with the music stopping then coming back in with the snare frame tap to an amazing kick drum entry and the heavy bass line
Idk who the back up singers are but they absolutely slay all of silk Sonics songs.
I’m so thankful that these two collabed to give the world amazing content like this
“DIS. BITCH. GOT ME…paying her rent!” is quite possibly the best damn lyrics I have ever heard.
Smoked all competition... Man, this song is so hot! Burned our house down with the groove...
Nah..Dont leave the door open again!!This was kinda happen...lol...
"Bad ass kids running round my whole crib like it's Chuck E Cheese" is definitely one of my favorite lyrics EVER
IF ANYBODY  SEXIER THAN BRUNO TELL HIM TOO CALL ME....
I want to know how long he practiced saying This Bitch because he nailed it.
I am that bitch
Excellent !   Love it !
This song will be the retro music that future kids listen to, and they vibin feelin like so 2021
Not typically my shit but this is smooth af. Contemporary lyrics old school vibe. Better than most of what's out there now.
Shit Genius
I love how this song sounds amazing but the lyrics are actually like"This hoe belong to the streets"😂
The official ballad of the phrase "She belongs to the streets".
I am 50+ years old and thought the best songs have already been written. This group proved me wrong. love this new group with Bruno and Anderson.
Xm radio got me hooked on this!!! Heart and soul!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fun way of telling it like it is with some women... LOL Must piss off some sisters out there. 60's/70's classic moves & sound... LOVE IT! 💜✊🏽✊✊🏽
Amo la parte donde Anderson se hace el muerto y luego revive jsjsjsj
IMELDIFIC!
they must know my oldest son's ex-girlfriend!!!! literally described her right down to the "trifling ass"!!!!! thanks guys for giving that chapter of my son's life a soundtrack!!!!!!!
Wow a million and a half views and I can't believe I've only watched it a million times already.
on replay dude
most iconic duo of 2021 imo. manages to combine the retro sound with the modern flair to make something that sounds completely new. this whole album is a work of musical genius. and the energy radiating from this music video is unmatched... the passion and comedy and just general good vibes... ugh who the fuck else does it like these two
i give it a 10/10

Bruno and silk.. Is the best duo ever.. I need more
*Its December 2021, lets see how many legends are listening to this masterpiece* 💙
Mmmm 0:31
Bruno is so cute bringing back old school. My jam!! Bruno had it from Day 1. Anderson nerds to lose the windshield wipers glasses. Anderson looks like the male version of Macy Gray.
I absolutely LOVE THIS SONG! 😍
This video goes so hard I can’t even describe it
This is a big hit
This is so nostalgic and it's younger than me
siempre q se juntan la rompen
My hubby just sent this video link to his bestie. He fell for a stripper, took in her kids, never made her work. All she did was spend his money everyday, would'nt keep the house clean, cook or put out. Long story short they going through a divorce now she's already looking for another fool. This song hit home for him. We tried to warm him can't turn a hoe into a housewife lol.
Fire!!!!
Song of the year for me
Just a daily reminder that any mindset such as depression anxiety suicidal thoughts are temporary feeling and times will get better keep your head up king I know it’s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel sometimes but keep faith in the man up top I hope everyone has a blessed Christmas🤞🏼💯
WHY IS THERE ONLY 1.5 MILLION LIKES?!??!
Soul Brotha #1. The man is righteous!!! Can you big it?!!
Mis amores♥️
Through all of this shit going on in the world, this puts a true smile on my face <3
This bitch  Has me smoking out the window  Great track guys thank you so much for it
This song and video got me hollering! I love it!
!!ALERT - MOTOWN SUPER VIBES!!
I love love this song! It's giving me Sugar Daddy vibes 🤣
hopefully Bruno isn't suffering too much wear & tear from carrying the entire music industry on his shoulders... I'd be honored if some Bruno Mars & Anderson Paak fans who appreciate 70s/80s classics would give a quick listen to my acoustic piano & vocal YT performances of PURPLE RAIN by Prince and WHEN I WAS YOUR MAN by Bruno in tribute to 2 all-time greats from different generations. Live acoustic with no enhancements. Peace & everybody stay safe.
What a great voices!
Guess Bruno threw that grenade back 🤣
Bruno mars el dios de hacer las mejores introos
Only song that got me feeling better after almost marrying someone who belong to the streets
Mans was laiddddd
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

(How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

This a smooth way to sing about a bad experience with a single mother.
That's what's happens when you leave the door open...
Play this at the family gathering and you'll get yourself, your neice, your mom and your grandpa jammin out.

My Favorite Song
Okey pero literalmente no dejo de escuchar está canción la amo <3
shee belongs to the streetssss
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
If you hear The Weeknd's "Belong To The World" and then this, you can find similarities between, like who are they singing about and all
I get this, "If MJ and Prince were pissed off and made a song" vibe. Especially when Bruno came back. The way he said bitch had some heft to it 😂
🔥
My favourite part is at the  Chucky Cheese
this duo is everything
Epic at such a high level, pure genius! 🤩👏
Too Gifted!!! We didn't know we needed this lol
best song on the whole album !!!
Listening to this, song so creatively. And the lyrics being so hilarious. Tune in to listen our reaction to this track.
They move so elegantly..Love love love it!!
The G.O.A.T
Они так красиво двигаются. Я абсолютно не поклонник r&b и подобных этому, но эти парни мне понравились. Сначала поумала, это какая то группа из 70х. Но так оно, видно, и было задумано.
One of the best I really love this song and I love you too for the both of for the both you artists
bruno mars dot need autotune autotune need bruno mars

Just when you thought they couldn’t outdo “Leave the Door Open”…  Silk Sonic: Hold my cigarette 🚬
The attention to detail, from the wardrobe, to them all wearing glasses, to the smoking to the plants. This video is fire.

It's crazy how many people come back to this everyday.This song is legendary♪
The only thing they left out was to put the cape on them when they went down!!
I vibe with everything they're talking about in this song 💯💯💯
Watching this after "Just The Way You Are" and I must say Bruno Mars' character arc is top tier
Im here before its 100 million views oh right keep it up
3:03 the best part <3
So beautifully done.
for me this feels like cringe
Its hillarious and absolutely awesome
Idk what's better the song or the acting 🤣🤣
Knowing Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars got played by a gold digger makes me feel better about myself
The humour in the lyrics is just fantastic! Love them❤🎉❤
Fav part 0:31
Beautiful - unity in motion.
This is art😌😍
They inspired by mickel Jackson
Oh yeah Bruno!!! What an amazing voice
Feels a bit different on 144p ngl
I'm gonna try and get Bruno Mars cancelled for appropriating 70s culture if that's okay with everyone
I feel pity for those people who are missing out on this masterpiece
<3
Sheeeeettt what to do what to choose 🤣
Can anyone say Sammy Davis came back as Bruno?!🤷🏻‍♀️
I feel like this song was made for Adam and latoya lol!!! If you know, you know 😂
One of the first songs to me that's beautiful and entertaining
certified hood classic
“Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die”  Then proceeds to die
They brought back that old school. All the way
Paak playing dead 🤣🤣🤣😩 did for me
graybeard thumbs up.
They never misses
I've in love with this song, the groovy dance choreography, the dapper velvet suits, the 70's nostalgia set piece, and Anderson and Bruno's musical chemistry.
It would be a travesty If this doesn’t get released on vinyl.
This is my favorite song on the album. Hands down. Silk Sonic best duo EVER!!!!!
Hallelujah
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib  Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh  I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mmh) But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How? How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (one thing's fasho) (One thing's fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belong to everybody) That girl there, she belong to everybody, ooh Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope  That your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (hoo-ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (woo-hoo, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belonged to everybody) (Yeah, yeah, she belonged to everybody) ooh
1:45 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I've already replayed this song for like 50 times now fuckin hell!!
https://youtu.be/kPvbb-E5FW4
You can tell they had a blast making this video
#BrunoMars  I tell you I can't leave this song alone. I keep playing this song at break, at lunch, when I get home.i just can't leave it alone!!😘❤😘❤💜❤
Man he went from "When I was your Man" to "When I give a Damn"
Anderson:Not to be dramatic,But I wanna die~ Bruno:This B*tch got me payin her rent,paying for trips. Diamonds on her neck,Diamonds on her wrists~  Meanwhile Anderson: Literally dying on the ground*
This reminds me of Usher and R Kelly, same girl!
Havent seen someone make cigs look so swag since the Marlboro man
This album is a cohesive masterpiece
The synced clapping after “got her screaming Hercules” 😙👌
The men ain't shit movement is losing alot of momentum since these hoes broke Bruno Mars. The same guy who would've caught a grenade for them 10+ years ago  has been fully transformed into this big pimpin' brother by the true nature of hoe culture.
I love this song
Me lembrou de Todo Mundo Odeio o Chris. Aquela parte da série que Tayler canta com um microfone.
Eu tô amando essa vibe mais antiga ❤❤❤
Who else has watched this an unhealthy amount of times?
Anderson .Paak playing dead on the ground will be ICONIC 50 years later..
This makes up for that god awful bet sypher pac had
Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak juss made my 2021🫀
Can we just appreciate the fact that they are all smoking singing and dancing at the same time!!blessedddd!!😭😭😭
"she belong to the streets" - future
Sorry, not sorry for the word but,  Fucking incredible song!!
Nunca erraaaaaaaaa....💕💕💕
When I was a kid I want to be a doctor, but now I changed my mind... I want to be the cigarrette. Lol
두 가수 모두 너무 존경하고 멋있습니다!
진짜 존경해요

My new national anthem.
Sounds like old soul ❤️
All the twitchthot simps be like
Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope  That your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets 😂😂😂
Hi Bruno Mars your fans the few were sick so my sister she has a pushing over you because thereYeah if I say it to your sister am I big fan and she love you do you love your song just for you are by Bruno Mars because you’re perfect for her well shit is so do I think waiting to do I’ll see you a person
That TikTok of them sounding dumb as hell can’t escape my mind when I watch this Imaooo
He is no longer catching grenades
Lmao Bruno dun been through some thangs. That "this BITCH" was from the soul 🤣🤣
Why is he doing so many collabs these dudes it’s weird
There's something about that "But I was wrong, 'cause she belongs" that scratches just that itch to me. I love this song and am looking forward to hearing more from these two.
Silk Sonic for Super Bowl halftime show please 🙏🏻
When Paak pops into the camera with the first "This bitch" I die laughing everytime ... They meant them shits Lmao ... Love this group and the album is amazing
Bruno your 15 minutes is just about up buddy
When you don’t like your lady but you have to be nice 🤣🤣🤣
This song always puts me in a better mood when I'm down
Not too bad. Close to Temptations, maybe some Delfonics as well. Too modern to compare them to the giants: The Drifters
Love this song
I love the random guy in the back with the keyboard.
1:44 Yamcha from dragon ball
I can only ever wish for a bruno x bradio collab
Bruno pleeze drop the misogynistic terms!  Don't hate on women!  B*tch, trick etc. NO!
Not the biggest Bruno fan, but this got that 70'/80's feel
They understood the assignment!
Hands down, best song of 2021!!!!! Greatest collab, awesome video, simple and classic!!! But these lyrics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m so in love with this…
Bruno PIMP hahahaha
Its 80's music I like you our music at 2018. I don't like this tipe of music. Sorry
Ese video es una joya
Hold on he's A backup singer much respect for to him for doing that for other back up singers
The playing dead and the Pop Up was everything while holding the cigarette. LMBO, I love the entire album.
Such a bop!!!!!
Mi canción 🛐
At first I thought that camera shake at the beginning (00:11) was unintendet but now I think it fits really well.
Smoothest way to convey the emotion, "belongs to the streets"
i luv it🥺🥺
THIS BITCH got me paying her rent
WE NEED A VINYL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
top!
Bruh she got my man stressed out if he smoking out the window 🚬
Paak delivery isn't good...honestly..not nowhere near bruno..feeling imbalanced
It weirdly sounds like a Lonely Island song.
THIS SONG GO HARD !
This is a song for the ladies that belongs to the streets
1:35
*SHE BELONGS TO EVERYBODY*  The way this line leaves me wheezing no matter how many times I listen!!!! :P
The part where Anderson.Paak says "I also hope your trifling a$$ is walking around barefoot in these streets" reminds me so much of something Morris Day would say 😆
Them holding ciggs makes me think David Chappelle should be at least in the background chillin and puffin eyh
oh STOP complaining... lol  this is one of the best videos out there....loving the glasses
Thanks for the video
To simply put it this song is 🔥🔥🔥 🚒
Boarknock squad!!!

Amo esta canción 💞
amazing music
Awesome Awesme Awesome! Even old heads love this song. We need more music like this. It is time to change from the same old thing that is noise . Let's get back to R&B that grooves and make you want to play over and over again. MTV AWARD, BET, Grammys Awards hands down.
❤️❤️❤️
man went from "ill catch a grenade for ya" to "catch this grenade bitch"
L
Proud of my man Anderson. From that subpar freshman freestyle with designer on xxl to rockin it with bruno mars
This song never gets old No matter how much l listen, l never get bored ♪
My favorite part of the song is when paak came in and described his heartbreak from the lady that belongs to the street. Alone
why is bruno mars just in the most timeless retro phase ever....its legitly the hottest music out with the oldest sound...like how are you coming out wit 70s hits in 2021? almost like he put the world in a time machine🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
That's what you get for leaving the door open, now you're smoking out the window
This is fuckin' amazing. haha

When you look at your man and think, you wish you could sing that to me....🤣🤣🤣but it ain't true!!! 🤣🤣🤣
noice
Just got a new car and this playlist is the only vibe I play in my Jezzy.🥰 Silk Sonic is life. ❤️❤️🥰🥰 You all have to listen to Anderson Paak albums 🥰 all of them.
I believe This is the beginning of Artist taking there music and souls back from the Industry.and giving that music back that breeds life into people especially the youth who have been deprived of for Year's now. Bruno and Paak (Silk Sonic) i Salute you. These the baddest brothers on the Planet in the industry right now, They didn't sell-out stayed true to the Soul of 🎵 music,and have put the industry and it's so called artist on Notice.
Holy shit need more from y'all 🔥🔥🔥
개 좋다..
#GROWN-FOLK MUSIC
The old school ways in 2021 🔥🔥🔥
Süperler ya
Bruno is what exactly what this generation needs gives them a idea how back then was!
I luuuvvvv this feat thanks to them in 2021 we are experiencing 70/80 years music
From catching a granades to dodging red flags 😂
Who hurt Bruno...This man bringin the 🔥🔥🔥 in his SOUL
Turn on the subtitles so you can learn how too sing
So glad to hear real music because this day in time the music is bullshit to me besides my boy Lloyd music but he's haven't did new music in a while...
Best song about a prostitute EVER!
Bruno Mars 😍
This entire album is FIRE!!!! But this has got to be my favorite song! 70s vibe!
anderson paak dead (real)
How Bruno go from leaving the door open for her to THIS B*TCH GOT ME😂😂😂
Yo the song slaps hard when the speed is @ 1.25
Dropping red pills cause of them 304's
Black Magic it's safe to say Good music is here forever
Divorced men's anthem right chea
Who hurt this man
ays ah, naka fortune pula
Redpill Anthem 2022
*NOW I GOTTA GIVE YOU BACK TO THE STRRRRRREEEEETTTTTS* 💨💨💨💨
Bruno saying “ this bitch” cracks me up not only the way he sings and his body movements 😂 but I absolutely love this song ❤️
I find the lyrics and delivery of this song hilarious and I don't know why😆. I've listen to it more than 10 times
Is this the same girl you were going to catch a grenade for Bruno? 🤣😅🏃
Do you play Minecraft
ZAMN😝
You guys can sing. Sly and the boom 💥
Bruno Mars spent his quarantine watching twitch thots and now he has the ULTIMATE SIMP ANTHEM.
I was expecting to hear "give you back to the streets"
🎵⭐🎵
Anderson fucking JUMPSCARED me.
Boaaa rapaziada tranquilo?  Lancei um álbum de trap feito tudo pelo celular apenas os type beat que são da net...se puderem dar uma força agradeço não vão se arrepender pprt 🔥🚫🧢
The cigarettes better be Newport or Kool
This just an appropriate way of saying “she for the streets” 😂😂😂
What’s amazing about this video is they never dropped that cigarette during this whole video while doing choreography
what an elaborate way to say that she belong to the streets
You can tell Bruno wrote this. He’s a genius!
Bring back the 70s 🤗
Applause 🙌🙌
TOP DEMAIS ESSA MÚSICA 🎶 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Still wondering who broke he's hart that bad🥲
Sound Motow 🤩😍
Masterpiece.
Ion know who say bitch harder nba youngboy or paak😂😂

This is honestly my favourite music video of this year
AMEN THESE HOES DO BE TRIFFILIN - God year xx/xx/xx
Shout out to my ex!!! I wouldn’t be here listening to this if she didn’t break a Nigga 😭😭😭
Liked the video but not the swear word AI
He ain’t ever gonna catch a grenade for you now
🤢🤮👎🏻
Absolutely beautiful.
ewwwww
I watch for the dancing.
Let's be honest... This guy deserves to have more people listening to their music :) I'm love with it (and with a special girl for me, someone who drives me crazy!)! Congratulations, you nailed it :)))
🌟AAAAAMOOOOO 😍💗
No fundo tem uma leve pega de Tim Maia, o que e otimo.
Now this is how you diss a woman lol #classy
Man there's just something about that Motown
ART ♥
Damn dats a song😭🔥
Loved the sound but they could have left out the bitch reference. Delefonics , ojays , stylistics we’re able to make music about being done wrong without going there..smh
vibes classic so tense woww
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

While I think this Music and its place in.the current entries to the music scene and to me it is certainly  welcomed versus some of the other options of questionable quality. But Here's a valid question???Why.would anyone include smoking. Cigarettes into the Whole Mix???It sends a Bad message to the viewers of this Genre.Cigarettes and  Cigarette 🚬 smoking is a very unhealthy habit to begin.I.think it should be taken out of the Video altogether.
Lovely one
My new jam🎶🎶❤️❤️
TBH... It sucks to be one of their ex'es right now!
I don't smoke but I can listen to music :))
Excellent voice and good Song, but the true stars don't smoke and overall don't speak about something induce dependence. True stars are spiritual, the Spirit don't smoke..
Não se presto atenção na melhor coreografia que já mais gostei ou na música
New favorite song 😩

อย่างเฟี้ยว😅😅😅
💯💯💯💯
This joint is amazing. I had to show my moms.
Hehe. I hope  bruno didnt made the lyrics from his experience  cuz this is an eye opener for men.   Whats the message, boys? Its dont get attached to single moms. They got a huge baggages that they be giving you once you two are in a deeper relationship. You didnt signed up for this!!!
Great song for paying your rent
Mi singer favorite ♥️🙏
Give em back to the streets
Dream convert silk sonic The Hamiltons in Thundercat
This song hits harder when you're single
I am obsessed with this song
This is the greatest song of the year!!! 2021 and 2022!
Fun fact: at 1:44, that floor is getting more action than you got in the pandemic.
About the lyrics "she belongs to everybody" Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, And The Silk Sonic didn't want to get this song get copyrighted by future's team, that's why its "she belongs to everybody" and not "she belongs to the streets" sadly.
Real music
Maury's FB page re-reminded me of this song.
The way he falls and lands face first and Bruno just steps over him, starts singing his verse and doesn't help him up 😂😂😂😂😂 I'm weak!

Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (one thing's fasho) (One thing's fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belong to everybody) That girl there, she belong to everybody, ooh  Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope That your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window (hoo-ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (woo-hoo, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belonged to everybody) (Yeah, yeah, she belonged to everybody) ooh
Silk sonic and akeem Ali get it done thank me later
A lyrical rant, yes!
She belongs to the city.... streets.
BrunoMarsくん、めっちゃシブイわ。
Anderson and Bruno bringing back 70s vibe with a banget
Pardon my virgin ass, what's " giving me Hercules" mean?
This song is smooth as fuck.
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
Omg! I'm hollering! He said, "I am not trying to be dramatic but I wanna die". The way fall down, stayed down, and jump back up singing again with that cigarette still in tact was absolutely priceless as hell.  Not to mention Bruno kept his cigarette while dancing and singing too. Towards the end was hilarious as f. He going say, "I hope you find what you're looking"...but the same breathe says hopes she's walking around  bare footed. I am completely dead. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀
Bruno never fail me 🥰🥰🥰
dont care who you are..if you cant get down to that groove...your dead inside..this band is killing it ..i mean bruno and anderson and the back ups are killing it..but this band..the bass the drums are just absolute..so dam good....these guys are amazing and bring back some great memories of music from days gone buy...
this kinda funny
0:31 1:51  favorite part of this music vid 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Who else is enjoying bruno mars like there's nothing else that exist
The way these guys are soooooo damn smooth!!! I can't even handle it, this is amazing!
This is funny asf 🤣  I don't smoke but next time I get pissed imma bum one off someone just to talk shit, not even going to light it
Come on, who doesn't think this song needs to be made into a SNL Digital Short, with Justin Timberlake and Andy Samberg singing about this greedy bitch??
My daughter got me listening to this....beautiful.
this is a classic, mesmerizing piece that I cant stop watching
THE SONG 🎉🎉🎉💽🤩🎉🤩🎉🤩🤩
Y'all I watch this multiple times and find new comedic moments.
Maaaan that dancing in sync was gold!
Is this...a classy way to say she belong to the streets
Admit it...you came here for one part.
I think Bruno Mars made cigarette smoking cool again
Brutal!!!!! ✨👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
And the Academy Award goes to....ANDERSON .PAAK

The best song in history.✨😎😎😎✨
There are so many funny moments in this performance, I just can't stop laughing and smiling,  I love their outfits  (what is that velvet?) and how Bruno looks really pissed about them kids in his crib! They so awesome!💕😘💕
This is what will happen if you leave the door open
Esse cara tem o poder de me encantar td vez q eu o ouço 💖💗💞❤
U went from.. amazing to smoking.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Call a girl a whore... And everyone dances with you... Sick.... 😂
Bruno Mars said BITCH with his chest
You know they was high AF when they wrote this. 😂🤣🚬
Amo Bruno Mars...e essa parceria ficou show!❤

I Love this song 🎵 Awesome rhythm and bass soothing tune🙂✌👍👍👍
Another jam 😍😍😍🔥🔥
Shouldn't have left that door open
This damn video got me dying....this dude just laid there and popped back up...I cryinnn...bahahahhahahhaha
My favorite part to the song “this bxxch got me paying her rent”
Now thousands of black folks will think cigarettes/smoking is cool and start smoking.  I wonder how many millions of dollars Philip Morris International paid him to do this?  What a set back for our people.
very epic song
Bobby Womack just did a two step in his in his grave to this song!!
The way he pops out in front of Bruno..... Smokin out the window🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is a pure masterpiece by Bruno, Anderson, silk sonic. This is so nostalgic and the song literally just came out, I'm here to listen to a classic song as it just came out. Amazing.
This song makes me want to live my best life.
1:16 my Favorite part👏😭
Bruno Mars he is very talented. He knows how to interpret both in voice and in the video. I still think he's Michael Jackson's son hahaha
Anderson "not to be dramatic" **dramatically dies and lays on the floor**
Sing that s&+# fellas!
Temazo 🤑
Not 1 dislike never seen that before
Terrible
Can’t stop listening to this lmao
Onnnnn repeat
Bruno is a beast! Silk sonic pure talent. 👌
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭 OMG
I love this song...just heard it played on The Heat Ch 46.  It's got that old school flava & vibe.  💃🏾🕺🥰
Hilarious...... This is priceless, love it!!!!
This song got me high even though I don't smoke 😭😅✌🏼
Get a nanny 😂
They be on it... 😂
This man is on Micheal Jackson level. Idc idcccc. HE DOESN'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT
Lets take a minute to pray . . .  so the TikTok kids won't use this art piece for a stupid trend🤞🏼
They're silk silky, velvety, creamy, cashmere-y and everything SMOOTH
I'm in love with his style. Motown all the way, but with that new old school vibes that always seem 2 come 2gether like peanutbutter & jelly....
This is a direct result of leaving the door open!!! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣
..YOU COULD CRY WITHOUT SMOKING.
From "I will catch a grenade for you", to this. Progress Mr. Mars.👍🏾
Came for smoking out the window, stayed for the "This bitch got me. . . " line.
Bruno mars ft the weeknd
bruno so pretty
Bruno thanks for bringing back that early 70s vide, and the Sammy Davis Jr. look.
Bruno went from catching grenades to throwing them back lmfao
Parabéns 👏👏👏👏
Da gosto de escutar
Anderson e Bruno estão impecáveis
Uplifting beat.. sad lyrics..   Like the wrold laughing at my suffering
The only man, I allow to culturally appropriate, because he does us right every time!!!
What a great song - so well sung and impeccably delivered.
So funny
Bruno’s done with being a simp 😭
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
" Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope That your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out" That exact moment Anderson.Paak Appears On The Side Singing these lines kills The FCK Outa Me, thats CLASSIC ASF!! This is what I call REAL MUSIC!
😫😫 ohhhhh 😍😍😍😍
Biiiiiiiiiiiiig up from France 💯💯💯💯
And the foot tapping on the beat! Baaaaaaby!
(No Bruno Mars music no no stay this music familiar is it now
Omg, another wonderful song from Bruno and Anderson. Love this 🥰🥰
Lembrei dos Jacksons😍❤!

I love this song 🥰🥰
Im addicted to this song
Philip Morris stock had a slight bump after this dropped
👏👏👏👏
Where are the god of lyrics? 😩😩😩
He went from "Unorthodox Jukebox" to "Bitch, Kick Rocks"
i get those uptown funk vibes here
For some reason I felt it when Bruno came in with the cigarette! 😂😂
It’s literally so crazy how every sentence in this song is relatable 💀 never try to wife up a girl who is wild at the club and does the weekly hookup with random men. DONT DO IT.
fire
This is absolute gold
Fun fact : All Bruno Mars songs are beautiful ❤️
my new tune is kinda bruno? maybe? you be the judge? 🤔❔
o cara gosta dessa epoca.
OMG🔥 One of the best collaborations!
it's the coming back to life for me!  smooth vid bruh

I don't who bruno mars is, i don't know who silk sonic is and I'm not much into music but this is probably the best song I've heard in my 19 years old life.
I thought I heard Smoking out the window 🪟 🌿🌬
This video has some serious Temptation vibes
what a cheap video,  his label knows that his music flopped, and that he won't sell more than 2,000 copies
What the paak~! man~ awsome~ wow  going to mars~
Impecável ♥️
That  oooh Nooo was well felt
Classic
She belong to everybody got me
Cool Ass Song....
amando essa pegada anos 80, nao deixou um detalhe escapar
At least someone is having fun this year

Anderson : Not to be dramatic, but i wanna die Also Anderson :*proceed to faking die dramatically
Funny that this videos cost a fraction of what most music videos cost now a days but I find it 10x more enjoyable 😂
Willie hutch- I choose you… this is what it sounds like!!

and i just get enough with the toxic modern rap shit, got disturbed by kids over and over with their sicko mode
Really missed the opportunity to say she belongs to the streets
Sprung is the word lol I love the music, it takes me back to the 70's Very creative
wait i got confused with the timeline here, somebody pls explain, i just lost my calendar. holly molly
Bit old really
"History repeats its amazing self"
Bruno really went from 'imma catch a grenade for ya' to 'imma throw the grenade at ya'
This group reminds me of Lucy Pearl.
🥰
This song funny asf 😂😂😂 but i love it 😩❤
The lit cigs add a certain perfect aesthetic i cant quite explain, the video would not be the same without them!! I love this joint!!
Fire !!! these guys on a whole nother level. whole album fire. Silk Sonic Rock and Roll Hall of Fame worthy

Please Do A Christmas Song!
90's vibe
I love Bruno Mars he never fails to impress with his songs or music videos 😩❤️❤️❤️❤️
Back to the seventies ...I love it💕💞
SUBARASHI⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
musica perfeita❣🦋🛐
thisd is so good i wish black people were real
I gat this one ,wooooh!
am i the only one who searched this bitch for this song
Omg there people who are bringing back 70,80,90 vibes back
It took me a minute but I finally figured out why this song sounds so familiar. It's the bells. Reminds me of  Never Can Say Goodbye and The Jackson Five dance moves at the end of the video. RIP  Micheal😘❤ And he smokes his cigarette like Marvin Gaye  Ha ha.
담배든거 오ㅑ케 섹시하냐
Love it!
Yawa ka bruno mars i love you huhuhhuhuh
If 80s Michael Jackson duets with Eddie Griffin 😂
The divorced men who got cheated on paying alimony finally have a song somewhat dedicated to them so they can finally sing along. THIS BITCH. 🤣🤣
The music he makes today sounds the same as the music he made in 2008 and I’m so freaking glad. I wish Miley, Selena, Justin, P!ATD, and Taylor swift would’ve done the same. I’m obsessed.
Bruno mars is the ONLY musician to keep it classy in this generation. This is how music is supposed to be IMO.  Not like Doja Cat. I pray Bruno never stops singing until the day he dies. I’m so fucking blessed to have him in this generation. I already miss “the good ol days” listening to this and it’s only been 4 weeks.
Loved the video....as a musician kept looking at the bass player's bass amp....brings back memories....too bad it wasn't even on.....back in the day, that red light on a fender cabinet meant you mean business!!!!  But you gotta admit, these guys did a great job on the song!!!!
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib  Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh  I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mmh) But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

(How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (woo-hoo, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belonged to everybody) (Yeah, yeah, she belonged to everybody) ooh
I was shocked that andesrson park fall sleep hahaha
Where is “The Weeknd”?)
here I am dancing to 70s vibes in 2021
Even as he’s playing dead, Anderson is STILL holding onto that damn cigarette
Bruno is sporting a 70s porn star mustache
I am a rocker... And I LOVE THIS! Gotta respect talent. THIS is MUSIC!
In there glory days it’s beautiful
0:50 😍😍😍
this collab has been the best thing yet
Como TD q vcs fazem...mais uma música maravilhosa ! Amei 🥰❤️
What the F is this??!! How can you make a full grown man smile while watching the entire video?
anyone else notice at 48 seconds where he 'sings' and then blows out the smoke? ruined the 70s live tv performance vibe for me. regardless I cant stop watching this video.
Smooth
3:01 those runs are 😍
Going to deep cuts mode records imagine Michael Jackson singing this b****  got me paying the rent paying for trips people would be losing there mind
Do you realize just how high Bruno is singing? Sick!
*Only 1980s kids will remember this.*
Versace out da door!
Still a banger
❣️
I just swooned with all that footwork and dance coordination!
That's pure dedication and talent!!!!
This shit here is da TRUTH!!! Damnnnnnnnn! We haven't had good shit out in the Music world like dis in years and years. That first time when Paak pops up and says This Bitch!!! I done damn near piss my pants from the surprise and bad ass that was. This song if fire!!! I hope they keep dropping beauties like dis hmere!!! Silk Sonic= Real Music that moves da soul!!!
Anderson Paak is the ultimate character😂😂😂😂This is the bomb!!!!! On repeat.
"But I also hope that your trifling ass is walking round barefoot in these streets lookout." Best Line Ever!!!! 😂😂😂
The moves. The sound. The soul. Ooof.
Love this song.. They make nothing but hits.
Anderson : Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope  That your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m wiiiiiiiikkkkk….
Sad song but this song only for the strong man ! Big salute, sir !
Bruno😭
Berta Foreign Weekly Top 10 12-5-2021 Top 8 LW:8 Peak:4 Weeks:4
Hail Bruno
Fire again🔥
Pure soul class . And funny to boot ,
I'm voting him for President! Fuk yeh!
Thumbs up because they have balls enough to have lit cigarettes on stage! I can hear the cancel culture dems whining now!
What I love about this song is the inspiration itself. Who would’ve thought that the oldest job in the world (prostitution) has some story to tell when one has an affair and the best part is, it is told through music with these great Artists.
Sounds like an old soul 70 group you guys must be listen to some old school soul
Beautiful 🌸🌹💝
Shit better than the radio version lmao 🤣
Not 1 dislike in sight 😂
WOW this is iconic!!!!
So fresh an so clean
Amooo... Lindos. Venham pra Porto Alegre, no Brasil!!!
I never really was into a lot of old school music styles but this is nice 👍
They're definitely in their own lane 😍💪🏾🔥 love them
Silk Sonic officially gave our generation (1997 - 2003) some "WHATCHU KNOW ABOUT THIS, YOUNGIN?!" music for when we get older..
When great minds and great talents combined. 😍
THIS BITCH GOT ME PAYING HER RENT PAYING FOR TRIPS........... I FELT THAT
The evolution of Bruno! I love it!
😎😎😎
Que maravilha 😌❤️🌌
"This bitch" I love that was put into a song lol
Love the song, choreography, and theme, but how many cigarettes did they burn in order to make this video?
Please watch my guitar cover of this song, thanks!
Increible
Esses caras cantam demais
Bruno mars looks so good like this though
1:25
Guys did it justice
This is a better combo than Yorke and Cole 99”. So good. Culture all day 🔥💯👊🏾
How to be the girl that they are talking about without being called a b...h  Haha never mind, I heard the end of the song. I really loved the song.
I'd like to think of this as a sequel to Grenade 😆
I love Bruno, simply the best!
Heres a lyrics video: https://youtu.be/TC2TWPPaK4Q
Video is fire!
God bless you dear Bruno and the Silk Sonic, love it, great song.
PERFECT MOOD
I love her song Bruno Mars I love it I love all your songs please text me back
So….not jumping out of planes for your girl anymore??
Thank
So much artistry going on but still so smooth its orgasmic.
didn't know Bruno Mars dated my ex
Got these bad kids running around my crib like it's chuck e cheese
Mane they went next level. Took me way back the whole groove is phenomenal.  But the lyrics on this one screams CLASSIC!
Give them all the awards  This album it’s a Time Machine!!!
Only these guys can make a song that drags a majority of women of modern times and be loved for it. The lyrics go right over heads and on its way up the charts!!! That's what u call musical geniuses 🤣 song is hot af rt doe
Bruno ain't catching no more grenades
Bruno needs to make a song with Future 😂
Love u bruno🙏🏻
A masterpiece. Indeed!
This bitch got me paying the rent🙄
1:52 had me dead when he came up
This is my new song now
Bruno Mars tá parecendo um charuto de tão mago kkk, musica top
💪🏼
When talent meets timing, perfection is born. Genius
Those smoke like 90's candy cigarettes.
That's a smooth brother right there. CLEAN N COME THRU WIT DA DIAMONDS
biggest talent on earth, Bruno Mars.
minute  2:45  If I don't show my high marks, I'm not Bruno Mars
it's literally only one thumbs down , this song is amazing
Epic!!! 😎😎😎😎 👏👏👏
This is pure 🔥  in the purest form
Smooth asf 👏🏾💯
I just noticed they were holding cigarettes... creative genius.
My days are back!!!!
I don't know which was the funniest when he died or came back to life!!! Lol
This is just so good ,,so well produced and so well performed ,,they have captured the 70 s vibe so so well outstanding and just great Andy
Spinning this track and loving it!
Smoothest track we need more of these Motown vibes
No one: Bruno Mars, bringing class and greatness back to music 🎶
Great song
ZAMN😍
This might be the funniest breakup song since Oran "Juice" Jones The Rain.
I love how Bruno Mars just went retro AF back in 2017 and he's hasn't switched back yet but has made nothing but hit after hit with a sound that is almost 50 years old. That is talent!
The beat is great
This is no cap a certified hood classic
Certified classic, no doubt.
Bruno is so clean and smooth hashtag silky
Vibez! 🗣THIS BiTCH! 🤣
MEU DEUS ISSO TÁ PERFEITO EM UM NÍVEL ACIMA DE TUDOO 🛐🛐🇧🇷🇧🇷🤍🤍
They way he keep sliding into frame, its just hilarious!
Red Pill on the rise. I'm young enough to put my life in order. We can do it. Fellow brothers 💊💪🏽
Um, did someome say instant classic? I think so!
Give her back to the city hahaha
"Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope That your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out"  Yaaaaaaaaaas Anderson on Fire
Why do I feel the urge to get a donk some lucky strikes and trim my mustache???😎
رددححح للصبح
Me laughing at everyone not paying attention to the lyrics.
The letter is trash but the rhythm is pretty good. Like reggaeton
I need to see bruno as el debarge in the next documentary on the debarge family!
"This Beach got me paying hs rent" will be stuck in my head forever
I need to learn this dance
FABULOUS ❤😘👏👏👏👏👏
Masterpiece 🔥
The chuck e cheese part sent me dead 😆
The chuck e cheese part sent me dead 😆
O Anderson é engraçado demais.  Amooo
Oh my I love it .this music kind of bringing me back too old school...love it
This 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That's what I'm talking about. You see young folks that old school style from the seventies is hard to shake. Talk about showmanship, class, style and cool floor routine is what we use to do that drove that ladies wild. Take note, take note.
Damn that was smoother than anything in this dog gone crazy world. Not my genre but Mr. Peter Gene Hernandez and Brandon Paak Anderson, they're both Paak na paak! Look for Manny Pacman's commercial and you'll know what I mean ( No, that's not right. The commercial was kinda lame). But anywaaay... ah smooth like bhrandeeehh!
Love it, smooth n sensual 🤩
I just show this song to my grandma and she's 72 years old. She got up quick and started dancing.    She said this is definitely 70s vibes all over again. Took her Waaay back to her days..   She absolutely love this song.
i looooooooooooooooove this! Giving me that soulful feel with a new school vibe.
Avec lui tous les genres de musiques sont bon!!!! 🔥🔥😍😍Bruno!!!!😭😭❤️❤️
1:33 “not to be dramatic but I wanna dieeeee”
❤❤❤❤❤
70's vibe & I'm loving it!🥰
That’s a THROWBACK!
Y’all the first “This bitch” has me rollling lmaoallaoaoa
This nearly 50 year old woman is in love with this album!
She belongs to everybody,  lol !
And ladies and gentlemen, that's our presentation on today's episode of, Soul Train.
Smokin out the window 😂😂 Got her bad ass kids running around my house like it's Chucky cheese!!💥💥🤣🤣🤭😂😂 I swear instant classic!! Man, and this happened in my life time. Thank you fellas, thank you, Bruno, Anderson, and everybody else. Got to find out their names, thanks 👏🏾👋👏🏿👋🏽👋🏾👏👋🏽👏🏿👏🏾✨✨✨💥💥💥✌🏾
Bruno's been red pilled.

This is a banger in Italy as well!! absolutely love Bruno hope he can come in a tour here
🙌🏻
9 months later world population will double thanks to this man.
Hold up, he's smoking out the window because he's in rented accommodation cause she took the house..... I like that.
Bruno mars went from "you can call me like 1,2,3 I'll be there" to "now I gotta give you back to the city"
Damn!!!!!
THIS B!TCH uhuifhdjjkfdhgdjsjd
No lie tho this song pretty much speaks volumes most woman be tripping like this exactly why if I gets no pussy she gets no play protect yall energy young kingsssss
amazed by their skill holding cigarettes while singing and dancing., maybe I should do it once a time, probably I could dance and sing like them🔥😄😬
unironically bruno mars is saving the modern pop music scene. Everything mainstream is trash rap
he never change his style, if he do, i won't listen
Algum brasileiro além de mim ouve Bruno mars ?
This song sounds like a sunny day when you’re off work.
Why does this define how music should feel to me 🤧
Everytime I see Simon from Coronation Street I  think of Bruno Mars. If you know, you know.
Ayy go crazy these niggas juggin
Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist 💎 🎶
How can you perform this set and not laugh.
Bruno Mars, Anderson .paak,Silk sonic -Smoking out the window (Lyrics) 👇👇👇 https://youtu.be/ZT_a7lFmwmo

Even vhs glitching at the bottom of the screen
Bruno Mars dancing skills makes me 🤤😍
I love all your songs
Bruno Mars & Paak SIlk Sonic
The best classic duo
Los jakson me recordaron cuándo en su adolescencia....buenos
when he said "Chuck E cheese"... I felt that 😌
Gorgeous! ✨💙
I need MotokiMaxted to do a car karaoke video with this song
At this point I watch until 1:47 and I go on with my day
What a great song! I also discover a beautiful violin cover from WeiNinViolin~  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa0j2cuk3OQ
DJ: “All Simps here’s your part coming up” Simps uniting harmoniously- “This Bitch got me paying her rent”
so fucking amazing
DJ: “All the simps sing this part” Simps uniting harmoniously- “This Bitch got me paying her rent”
What's that, a retro vibe? Lawsuits from washed up genre artists looking to cash in on his success in 3...2...1
Hahaha😂😂
What I get from this song is, the chick is a gold digger
Bruno > Drake
island boyz new song #lanelletyler https://youtu.be/9rmxpOOvsWY
this song fuckin slaps
W video W song
Anderson Paak be Baak. F*ck I missed him...he's the soundtrack to my happiest life.
They took the Motown vibe and gave it their own twist and I'm loving it so far!
That's that good ol loveee fooo
Young bucks realizing that real music actually comes from musicians and instruments, not beat tracks.
No body talking about the great beat
See this what happens when you "leave the door open"
🇧🇷
Really bothers me they fake smoke the cigarettes lol
“Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib like it's Chuck E. Cheese!” 😄😃😁
That boy breezy lovejoy !!
DAWG, are my dudes so down bad that they jus sang a whole song about how she belongs to the skreets?
I like it
I like it
I'm crying 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏿‍♂️ dude said "THIS BITCH"
Is there a vinyl release?
1 thing for sure, BRUNO MARS NEVER DISAPPOINTED US🤍
Can't stop watching this.
I hysterically laughing every time I hear this fucking song 😂😂😂
Damn, I wanna smoke outta the window. But I f***ng guit!
They clownin
It's just good to see how they're just enjoying making music together. No sense of competition, no tension. Just good music. 😘
Yeah...right. 👎  Cliche  💩
This is  the anthem for "She belongs to the streets"
So the Rock, Kevin Hart, Ryan Reynolds, Andy Samberg? Fuck it. Get everyone on a parody of this on SNL. See y'all there 😂
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

Bruh
Bruno Mars is just fed up.. Anderson Pak demonstrated.. this song is life
The fact that they shot this whole thing with cig in hand…. *chefs kiss*
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
ม่วนนนนน
Bruno is reincarnated from the 60's.
It was hilarious when I saw Anderson.Pakk playing dead on the ground.😂😂💕
smooth
First time hearing this they killed this shit fr 🔥🔥🔥🐐
So good!!! ✨🙏
“브루노말스&앤더슨 픽” 의 끝은 어디인가 !  👌🎹🥇🎬🎼🎧🎺🎷 Merry Christmas 🎄🎁
Nostalgic and refreshing.....damn this is good!
This is the Bruno Mars I was waiting for all those years ago. So smooth
Man went from dripping In finesse to damn I just got finessed
We need more music like this  I miss this type of feel good music
Shoutout to the Brittany Renner’s…. Having us n^^^az “Smokin’ out the window 💨…..   Ya dirty b^^***che’s🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The title should have been "she belongs to the streets"
my man anderson cosplaying ninoy aquino wow
I like your songs Bruno Mars
Whoever pickin tht 🎸 guitar 😲 😊 ❤ 🔥 🔥 🔥
Ugh this song is so good I’ve been playing this on repeat and vibing 👏🏽💗💗💗🕺🕺
Anderson paak is giving Bobby Womack
this song made me want that problem.
1:19 always make me wanna stomp and clap to the beat
Estilo retrô, como eu amo e ja estou viciada nessa canção não paro de ouvir !!Bruno e Anderson combinação perfeita..
I love this song… definitely on repeat
There is a whole other video they made to this joint that'll probably never see the light.
So you slag Greta Van Fleet for being too derivative…?
I like that they always keep anderson paak and bruno mars slightly distanced so you don't see the height difference as much.
Day one hundred 💯 of commenting
I GIVE IN.... I thought I would never love or listen to modern music again.. but here I am grooving with an uncontrollable duck face to every song these MFs are putting out.
R&B is back XD
i love this wish i could work with these guys
He went from, "I'll catch a grenade for love..." to I'm throwing them bytches back. 😆😆😆
How to tell her she belongs to the streets in respectful way:
All they need is the weekend then they are called the Jackson Jrs
*joya* ❤
Dis Group PeriodT Is A Masterpiece Walking 👑🏆👑🎯🎯💯
Every time they start singing "this bitch" I smile, because good for her. I mean, if he's smoking out the benzo(the benzo), he's clearly not out of a house or home.
When I watch this I think of the instagram post Bruno shared a while back of his dad literally standing next to Michael Jackson (circa 70s). So crazy how life turns out. MJ would be proud.
I am literally experiencing an eyegasm and eargasm simultaneously which I did not know was possible
1:50 Anderson .Paak jumpscare
I love Bruno mars and Anderson paak
Singing how cloud she do this to me yes sir
Ues sir
I can't be the only one still wondering how Bruno wasn't laughing at Anderson. Paak laying on the floor. How did he focus?😂
Your on a higher level than drake/weekend with never missing. Every ducking song 🔥
I quit smoking just before this so came out! I love the song and triggered all at the same time! So many emotions 🤣
YAAAAAAASSSSS!!!  You guys are FIRE x 1 million!!!!!  Anderson when you fell on the floor and played dead....LOL!!!!!!!!
This is the first song on YouTube I have seen make it to 1.5 million views without one thumbs down
Alot of cousing
When Anderson died I died of laughter because of the way he was.
Why is this song not on the credits of a movie 🍿 😁😁😁 because it needs to be
🦍♥️
They ain’t have to make such a ✨BOP✨ I’ve had this song on repeat for the 5th time 🤣
It would be so cool to see them perform at a small venue !
1 vrai génie ❤️‍🩹
"He threw the Grande back"💀💀
The classic I love/ hate song. That bitch that got you so sprung, you simp. Lol

The intro sounds like it has interpolations from 50 CENT - What If, GRODT soundtrack
From Turn around, tease me to this b***h got me smoking out the window. She a tease for real! 🤣🤣  but all jokes aside I honestly love Bruno Mar's music! He is a complete artist
This dude actually died on the floor for like 10 seconds . had me on the ground dyin .🤣🤣🤣
Very Classy Diss Song! 😂😂😂😂 Someone better talk to that biatch! She messing with a brother`s feelins and he straight trippin😂😂
The classic feel x comedy is life!
Bruno is a genius.
James brown just got a woody 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Uno de los mejores temas de la decada
The only one whos capable to hit that puff and high note at the same time - Bruno Mars!
Smooth 😍
The best music 👏🏻
The falling down and the moves were together and in sync. The video matches the song beautiful job you guys. I saw your live performance on the AMAs. It was priceless!
Love it. Bruno Mars and the entire group takes me back to my younger days when music was enjoyable to listen to.
I can listen to this song all day long. I am so stuck on this song. #brunoMars I could watch Bruno sing and dance all day long.❤
😍😍😍😍
*THAT LIL DANCE IN THE BEGINNING GETS ME EVERY TIME*
É meu amigo enquanto muitos homens não aprenderem o que é mulher de verdade Ainda teremos muitos deixados em uma janela fumando.

Günlük dozumu almaya geldim
This pair singing style is quite  interesting and supporting to each other

🌹🎼🎶🌏🌈♥️✌️ Munich 2 0 2 1
See that's where you fucked up Bruno Mars! You don't date single moms. Period.
Give her back to the city my new caption 😂😂
Not me dying of laughter every time I  Anderson laid out on that floor through Bruno's whole verse🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They have to get future on the remix
Key & Peele : y'all did say B*itch doe right ? Pak & Mars : yeah we said .... B*ITCH !!!
1:44 he's actually on the floor omg 😂😂😂💀
Smoothest way to tell someone what kind of a bitch they are.
0:32 "This bitch, got me *payin* her rent" Only after hearing this line, this is already one of the top 10 Bruno Mars songs.
I can't say anything, Silk Sonic is the best for the world right now
Smoking is injurious to health, but Smoking out the window sure ain't.
thats  what the fuck im talking about
Rough times coming for women. Better start and OF, ladies. No man is willing to put up with you gals anymore🤣👍
they make me fall in love with jazz
Love Bruno’s music, but he’s beginning to look a bit like a crackhead.
Smokin out the window 😂😂😂😂
She  she  belongs  to the streeeeets
DIS BITCH GOT ME PAYIN HER RENT 😩😩😩😩😩

ok now all we need is bruno mars with the weeknd on a track…
What sorcery is this?!?!
Bruno and the Gang
This Jam So Hard, The Beat Nice Af Too.  Lyrics So🔥
Every relationship on earth.
Don't worry this song will never get expire❤️
it's so damn good that 3 mins is too short.. should've pulled out an "all to well" song length
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are some of the only two things getting me through hard times, thank god for music! I love you! 💜
I'm here because I've seen this music video in Facebook and I've searched the lyrics for me to find this song. Anyone else who did the same?
😍
Is this the Marcos theme song?
my new favorite song, i'm in love with this song.<3
Even if you play this with the lowest resolution, its still smooth as butter.
This is amazing haha
jackson 5
Perfect song From Greece with love!!
Here's a tutorial on how to say SHE BELONGS TO THE STREETS!! in the most subtle way.
certified hood classic
first, leave the door open, now smoking out the window, what’s next? watching the tv??
This song is the moment.
I wish there be more groups who play their instruments with  development like this very professional like back in the day  groups of The Temptations The Spinners  The Whispers The Ojays The Jacksons Prince and The Revolution New Power Generation  Switch & Debarge Kc and the Sunshine band etc.
Just the other night she was grippin on me tight screamin Hercules 😂😂
Sammy davis Jr vibes
My mom loves this type of song and I don’t get a chance to put a song 💀
I'm enjoying that Bruno Mars started making period-typical 2000s music, and has since spent his career working backwards through the decades. I'm personally loving it.
This music is amazing and a masterpiece
This mv is so funny lol
this collab is dooooppppe
Pov : u are reading the comments while listening to the song🤣
0:10 simple move but powerful
I can't believe this is an actual music video, and not a cartoon musical skit. I mean the first minute felt like it was
Bruno Mars is so pretty
This is what you call music
I JUST LOVE THIS VIBEEEEE
I'M in love ❤️
Cigarettes kill people, must not promote thus poison
Smokin out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo.........
Good song. Cigarettes?
Is he dead
I wonder how many ciggrettes were harmed during the shoot of this video...!?
Yes sir, she does belong to everybody.
Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak are truly the only artists of this decade who can successfully make the music scene jump back to the 70s again
This song is like a cigarette that tasted like butter.
Anderson paak's high as hell😅
This is my song🎵 Old school feel w/ new vibe mixed together🎩👍🏾I ❤'s my oldies & they didn't imitate any band they just added their own spin to it👏🏾🗣
Wohhh Wohhh 🎶
70s version of "she belongs to the streets"
(ignore this pls i just need the lyrics)  Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mmh) But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How? How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (one thing's fasho) (One thing's fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belong to everybody) That girl there, she belong to everybody, ooh Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope That your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (hoo-ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (woo-hoo, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belonged to everybody) (Yeah, yeah, she belonged to everybody) ooh
I love this. It has a 70's ring to it
The close out was ridiculous
The way they play off of each other was lie Michael and Jermaine.  It was perfection!  They both play with the camera well.  The group as a whole moves flawless.
May the Lord bless Silk Sonic. Starving for this stuff.  This was Jackson 5 / Temptation level stuff here. Thank you so much
I just looooooove this song!
I stay wanting to upvote this, and its already upvoted…. Can the algorithm connect me to people doing the same and we just dance
ok, easy
MY FAVORITE!!!!
definition of good vibes:
Bruno mars we love you from nepal❤️🙏🇳🇵
uf
This song should be an award winning song
I want that glasses
OMG THE CIGARETTE ASH MADE ME NUT
Bruno laid this out after dealin with one too many of these Modern Females.....brotha took the red-pill...
And not a cigarette hole in the carpet to be found. Brilliant!
2:21
When paak pops his head in  "this  bitch " 🤣🤣
00:47   best part
I missed music like this man
anderson is giving bobby proud energy
This album and singles need to be charted higher. So go to iTunes and Spotify and stream this album and singles. This song is currently #10 - it needs a rebound.
‘…but I also hope that your triflin’ ass is walk-in’ around barefoot in these streets’ 😆
still just waitin for them joints to get lit up
I love Andersons voice!!
This song is priceless and the fainting on the floor dead. The chucky cheese reference. These geniuses have me dead cracking up. The best. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
te amo.
Silk sonic makes my trash earphones listenable❤
OK --- Did I fall through a rip in the fabric of time? This is pure 1970's gold ......... As if the best of The Chi-Lights and Earth, Wind & Fire has been channeled to create this perfection............
She belongs to the streets 😂should be on the hook 🪝 I think he coulda song that part
She is not yours. It is only your turn.
Bruno Mars is the Nintendo of music artists and I've enjoyed all his music albums.
I literally wake up singing this song. The true definition of madness!
Real music✨✨✨
HERE I AM ALL ALONNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Pretty redpilled and based song yo 🤭
Yo this video here is my new favorite 😅😅
They kilted this! They are definitely the super group we didn’t know we needed!
I've been watching too much Cowboy Bepop, because Bruno Mars is giving Spike Speedle/Fearless vibes.
Not 1 dislike . Amazing song!
Went from 'count on me' to count your days 💀 He's not simping anymore 📸😰
And people say women are dramatic 😂
Damn 👀He’s down but still holding that cigarette 👀 Love it ❤️🤣that’s entertainment ! 😎
Pure talent....
I hadn't listened to this for a couple of weeks and some change, and just a few minutes ago it came up as an ad. I was like "now I gotta go listen to it again."
Someday this is what 2030 kids will call "Vintage" and us in the 2000's will smile and say "It's been that long already huh?"
Their best single so far!!
I appreciate Anderson Pak, Bruno Mars, Musicians for simply " doing their thing; write, create and do music--and I'm glad they did because of their originality spunned on SOUL/FUNK/CLASSIC R&B!!!--thanks Mr. Bootsy Collins for collaboration with their genius!!!
They understood the assignment
Music that awakens the soul. Love it! Keep the hits coming. I’m here for all the vibez…
What are you complaining about, thats what you got when you leave your door open 😂😜
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

Straight up 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I would believe it if they told me that they recorded the song on this stage
Ear to Ear smiles! The vocals are just uplifting.
I don't know how or why Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars got together but it's the greatest thing that happened to music in a very long time.
🤣🤣🤣🤣👌👌🐐🐐🐐🐐
I am willing to bet that’s a Kool that he is smoking. For my Naija peeps the equivalent of a saint moritz. I say this because the issues he is having has passed the capacity of newport
Bruno is hilarious!!! Not give her back to the city!!!
so now that Bruno is not catching grenades anymore. It’s like he has been watching Kevin Samuel and listening to Future.
Solid f'n gold!
Flawless singing plus comedy…perfection👌🏽
At 1:42 you can see Anderson on the ground like he just got murdered and there about to put white tape on the ground around him
Perfection
I love Bruno. He can be a whiteboi or a nigga. All he has to do is change his hair.
Bruno never disappoints

Quel bonheur!!!! La subtilité des paroles pour renvoyer une tchoin à sa place (le trottoir on the street) avec calme et esprit, la musique, les voix, l'humour du clip, (merci Anderson .Paak lol), un bonheur absolue!!
I really thought this was parody song of Leave The Door Open 🤣

I am not old, but this is proper and real music. Thanks for bringing top-notch class and talent on the screen again.
I love this song!
Anderson .Paak  stole the lam light from bruno mars... that nigga is talented but he is so underrated, never knew he had an amazing vocals.
This was a very impressive video. I love it
Gracias Dios!.. Regreso la buena música...Por favor que se quede!!!
Good stuff
❤💯💯💯💯
The weekend,Bruno Mars this combination make a song
Como amo a este hombre! Me encanta como canta ,como baila.Es maravilloso.De lo mejor que hay en el mundo.Pienso que no tiene el reconocimiento que realmente se merece.Se merecía un gramy  o más,él y Anderson Paak.Son geniales!
Bruno Mars is a swagapino baby😎
I've got them on repeat! They can do no wrong.

🎶Q: Smoking out the window singing how can she do this to me?  A: people only do to you what you allow them to do to you. This song should be entitled The diary of a Simp!
So smooth
At first I didn't like it but after i heard it a few times, I am addicted 🙁
I didn’t expect him to be on the floor :-) that was so funny

Ai meu sonho conhecer o Bruno viu sei que é impossível mas seria a pessoa mais feliz desse mundo quando ouço ele saio até desse mundo por alguns momentos 🤗😍👏🙌🤗😍
All started with I’ll catch a grenade for you lol
The fact that there are only 4 people singing makes me wonder why it sounds like a whole choir
Instead of motown it's simptown
this song is just 😫🤌
I keep getting this ad for this song and I never skip it
This is made to be a classic right here.  Honestly one of the greatest songs I've ever heard.  Wow, what a performance by both!
I love them all dancing so in sync together.... Every song Bruno has ever done has been gold .. pure gold ... I gotta say I do not like his 70s porn star look .. wouldn't be so bad If he dit he's the mustache ... But these song silk Sonic does together are just pure genius ... Ok I miss bruno clean cut I'd catch a grenade for ya look ......
When bruno sang the high note dropping on his knees platinum
My fav
... And the Emmy for Best Performance in limited series goes to: Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic, "Smoking Out The Window," 1:43
0:32 is best
Gold ✨✨✨✨✨
The way he popped up 😂😂😂
Master Bruno
The official “say no to single mothers” song
I love you, Madelyn
Wait.. anderson can't rap, but can sing? Why didn't he start out as a singer than a rapper or hip-hop (can't tell the difference these days)?
Bruno Mars your fool for this one
No comment No judgment No statement
I love this song!!
I miss the old 'sad boy' simp bruno.. he promised to 'catch a grenade you' but turn up 180 degree  into this kinda person
I sooooooooo love this song!!!!
I only can say the team is a genues~~the music is so pleasant and soft, but the lyrics talk about bad things a woman did. Interesting~~
Who came here because you watched Jelly Roll and his wife Bunnie video and had to know what Jelly was listening!!!! Me!!!!
I feel like this was a missed opportunity with Durand jones and the indications…
1:43 🤣
1:15 to 1:21
this girl had bruno fighting martial artist. OH NAH
Ayyyyu
"This bitch got me payin her rent" 🤣  Omg I love these guys. Paak is good with Bruno but he was good by himself too
OMG This is cool as hell, and funny as hell! Great job homies!
Eh nada t that much
Did y'all just hear the last notes from Bruno Mars tho 😳 the ooo ooo ooo 😳😳😳😳WTF‼
I've seen the parody of this song a million times before I finally got a chance to see the original. Some of this this is really funny just like the parody.
1:30
Omg they're GREAT
This song is shady and funny as hell!!🤣🤣🤣
My favorite song! I loveee it!
na that stomp was hard 🤣
Silk Sonic + Bruno Mars= *NEW GENERATION OF THE TEMPTATIONS!*
Tbh I used to have a crush on Bruno mars and my fav song was uptown funk I would jam out
Takes me back to Summer of 1977.  I'm 10 years old & just learning about songs on the radio, playing outside from dawn to dusk, but running into the house like gangbusters every time I hear Andy Gibb singing, "I Just Want To Be Your Everything," on the AM radio playing out our kitchen window.  It's a love affair with music that has lasted my entire life.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

This music fits Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars perfect.

Has anyone noticed this sounds like the opposite of New Edition song called this one reminds me and you.

The amount of sass Bruno exudes is immaculate.
Lyrics  Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

Anderson is so dramatic 😂
Bruno who hurt you?
Went from imma leave the door open to imma change the locks
Amazing musicians nobody is as smooth as these brothers rn
Shoot!! My Honda EG Hatch became a Tesla!!
She belongs to the street in a song
These guys together make amazing music. Whole album is straight fire
Jackson five wannabe...smoke while singing. bad attitude
This the most comedic, artistic and majestic music video I’ve ever seen dude
Nice to know that Bruno was singing and playing drums at the same time lol jk
this is the best song ever
Brilliant
One of the best songs I ever heard💯👍👍
still loving the 70's vibe, not as good as "Leave tenor open" bu they on the same train...
Nice song
OMG this is a classic
WoW
Another hit !!!
This song will like Snoop
Anderson Paak playing dead is pure GOLD!!!!
I love this song so fucking much man. I sing it every day. It gives me life!!!!!!

I love this
Art

'Don't wanna be dramatic... but I wanna die....' and Anderson proceeds to drop 😍
👌🏾
Look up the definition of swag: you will probably see a picture of Silk Sonic.
This comment is for ppl that will come after years and that probably aren't born yet
♥️♥️♥️
I didn't like Bruno so much when he made a lot of love songs but I love him since he went with the old school funk style
Oh Lord, thank you for reminding us, that music like this ain't dead and can still be produced in this ERA. Big UP guys
what chapter of life did I miss, Bruno is now a pimp???   (not mad though 😳)
It's good, the prop cigarettes are totally distracting though
This whole vibe is dramatic.  Got peeps smoking out the window. How could they do this to us?🔥🔥🔥
Woooooooooo bring out the quads and open the rinks
Bruno mars  Anderson .paak Lindo cantas voz Te quiero muchos  Bendiciones deseos Bendiga mi Erika  Besositos corazón
The creativity & vibe  is beyond unreal 😍 🙌🏾  this is an epic dynamic duo 🍾🥂🌹💋

This group is right here. Music is full of fresh air! We need more music like this. It's been a long time coming for this. Thank You!
The drama in this vid is grammy worthy. The smash brothers did it again!
My grandmother is 83 years young and she plays this album constantly! She said it takes her back to the 70's. Silk Sonic are setting the bar high!!!
I was not ready for Anderson. Paak to be on the floor😂😂. I love this
Woaaaahhhhllaaaaaahhh

Bruno is on some hoodville energy now
if they really want a classic soul sound then turn up the bass and add some acoustic piano up front.  This is a step in the right direction though.  But listen to some classic Al Green, Smokey Robinson or Marvin Gaye and you'll get what I'm saying about the instrumentation.
That's what happens when you leave the door open 👌🏾
This will never get old
H A R M O N Y
I can imagine how many takes this took. Lord knows I couldn't keep a straight face 😂🤣😅
Please god let them keep making projects together after this fucking masterpiece
Yeah she belongs to everyone...with money.
Listening to this track right here had me pricing a jukebox. Take me back to the days! 100%
Anderson on the floor like: "Don't mind me just pretend I'm not even here"
Just when you thought nothing could be in the same lane as 24K magic ... Anderson Paak said "Bruno, Hold My Beer"!  This song is a masterpiece & it's comedic all in one song! Bruno & Anderson Pakk out did themselves when I first heard this I'm like Ooooh LOL 😆  Heavy Rotation
Masterpiece
I like songs
SILKYSMOOOOOOOVE 🤩
NAH SILK SONIC BITCH AIN'T  NO WAY TOO CALL A LADY. A WOMAN.  SMOKIN' NOT ON MY CLOCK. TIC TOC KEEP WALKIN'. UNTIL YOU REALIZE AIN'T  NO LADY LIKE YOUR OWN. PUT A RING 💍  ON IT AND SAY I DO.

MICHAEL JACKSON'S SOUL FLOATS EVERYWHERE
I CANT STOP LISTENING TO THIS SONG
0:16 OH NO!  WHY THE WAY IN WHICH ANDERSON HAS SAID IT IS SO SATISFYING?   its a born meme😂😂🤣🤣
nice!
This should not be as funny as it is to me!
So fucking good, 100% smooth and simple moves, vocals amazing.
This is remarkable
I think Doja and Bruno are talking about the same rent.
This song is so fire. Modern time with a old school feel. I can’t stop listening to this song.
The way this song is so good, i thought it was from my childhood,sounds like that song youve always liked from childhood
Muy bueno Son maravillosos Me trae un Kool & the Gang Salvando los años!

Michael Jackson would have LOVED Bruno Mars! Not.. you know... that way... just... You Know!

Bruno’s character is too good man, the acting alone is phenomenal.  At 1:36 the movements with the cig to his head and all anyone get me

Paak needed that dub, i remeber that 2016 cypher
I only found this song bc of a clip of that guy dying and reviving…and DAMN this shit slaps hard

Bruno is one of those artist that won't make new music for years and suddenly comes back with a banger album.
Bruno’s part is 🔥 every ones is good
So smooth with that old school vibe

Feels like bitch was back stage and he was singing right to her…that finger point with the head turn like yeah bitch I’m talking to you!!! Out here looking like a 70s sugar daddy that’s fed the fuck up with not gettin his sugar  And that “I don’t mean to be dramatic but I wannadie” and falls to the fool R&B just be so damn dramatic…you Betta werk…..I am weak I could go on all night!!!
Should’ve never caught a grenade for her 😔         Ik it’s cringe 🤣🤣
This man Anderson is a whole fckn' fool!!! 🤦🏿‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This ain't even explicit content
I'm serious. I thought they blew me with leave the door open but this group right here is musical gold. Every dance move every slide in and out, the comedy, the talent. This here is untouchable🔥🔥🔥
Great song, but somehow Anderson looks like Dave Chappelle, even same mannerisms when Dave would do skits in his show back then
I'm in disbelief in how amazing they are. Like they got my mouth hanging open❤️❤️❤️
Did he just say  BITCh! Not Bruno.
LOLOLOL😂
🤣 💀
Songs that I like to release new bands again.
The dancing ain't even nun crazy but it's so 🔥
I keep coming back to this song
Definitely getting 70s music vibes
Y’all should make music together forever!!! Real talk
This song is so smooth
Lyrics  Wait a minute, this love started out so timid and so sweet But now she got me (smokin' out the window)  Must've spent thirty-five, forty-five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E Cheese Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin': How could she do this to me? (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, oh  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin': Hercules (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please)  Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin': How could she do this to me? (How? How could you do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me (one things fasho, one things fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong to) to everybody, everybody (yeah, she belong to everybody) That girl there, she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here, baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round bare foot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window (oh) Singin': How could she do this to me? (How could you? How could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) to everybody, everybody (yeah, she belong to everybody) She belong to everybody, oh  Espera un minuto, este amor empezó tan tímido y tan dulce Pero ahora ella me tiene (fumando por la ventana)  Debo haber gastado treinta y cinco, cuarenta y cinco mil en Tiffany's (oh, no) Tengo a sus hijos rebeldes corriendo por todo mi piso Como si fuera Chuck E Cheese Me pone en un aprieto con su ex hombre en el UFC No puedo creerlo (no puedo creerlo) Estoy incrédulo  Esta perra me tiene pagando su alquiler, pagando los viajes Diamantes en su cuello, diamantes en su muñeca Y aquí estoy completamente solo (completamente solo) Tengo tanto frío, tengo tanto frío Me tienes aquí afuera  Fumando por la ventana (fumando por la ventana) Cantando: ¿Cómo pudiste hacerme esto? (¿Cómo pudiste hacerme esto?) Pensé que esa chica me pertenecía solo a mí Pero me equivoqué Porque ella pertenece a todos, a todos, oh  Justo la otra noche ella me estaba agarrando fuerte Gritando: Hércules (Hércules, Hércules) Me tienes en la disco buscando un nuevo amor Alguien ayúdame, por favor (ayúdame, por favor, ayúdame, por favor)  Nena, ¿por qué estás haciendo esto? ¿Por qué estás haciendo esto, niña? No quiero sonar dramático, pero quiero morir  Esta perra me tiene pagando su alquiler, pagando los viajes Diamantes en su cuello, diamantes en su muñeca Y aquí estoy completamente solo (completamente solo) Tengo tanto frío, tengo tanto frío Me tienes aquí afuera  Fumando por la ventana (fumando por la ventana, el Benzo) Cantando: ¿Cómo pudiste hacerme esto? (¿Cómo? ¿Cómo pudiste hacerme esto?) Pensé que esa chica me pertenecía solo a mí (seguro que, seguro que) Pero me equivoqué (me equivoqué) Porque ella pertenece (pertenece a) a todos, a todos (sí, pertenece a todos) Esa niña de ahí, ella pertenece a todos  (Oh, no) Mira aquí, nena Espero que hayas encontrado lo que sea que necesitas Pero también espero que tu mediocre culo esté caminando sin nada por estas calles Mira  Niña, me rompe el corazón que no estés aquí conmigo Ahora tengo que devolverte (tengo que devolverte) A la ciudad, oh, me tienes  Fumando por la ventana (oh) Cantando: ¿Cómo pudiste hacerme esto? (¿Cómo pudiste? ¿Cómo pudiste hacerme esto, nena?) Pensé que esa chica me pertenecía solo a mí Pero me equivoqué (me equivoqué) Porque ella pertenece (ella pertenece) a todos, a todos (sí, ella pertenece a todos) Ella pertenece a todos, oh
1:16
The choreo of Bruno's group is so smooth & sexy. And his vocals, exceptional. Anderson playing dead is so cute & funny. Wonderful, fantastic, great job!!!!!
Love the song , hate the video !!
Oh my!!!!! This is another mega major hit!
Anderson Paak’s death scene was Oscar worthy.
Lettts goooooo!!!
epic song
Babi boleh ak sekali je jangan keluar iklan iphone, serabut bodo

my ear are being bombarded with a million different sound and it works so well and I am in love with this song.
Just beautiful!
I can’t be the only one who play this song around the house when they argue with their spouse 😂
Perfect 🥰 💞 👌🏾

Why do I feel like "this bitch got me paying her rent, paying her trips" it's a response to Doja's "Men ain't shit"?
This guy is smoking those high notes for decades now, unbelievable
Amo 😍 este estilo de música ♥️🎶🎶 Saludos de Argentina 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
well  hot damn
Motown be like
Video promotes smoking tho…they left the door opened to get wrecked by the fcc..
I was just playing the Sims 4 and my Sims's wife left us so I'm feeling this.
Jackson 5 v 2021 hehe
No jak chcesz to potrafisz Bruno
Bruh dislikes removed… cmon…
How we say in Brazil: Classes
This is so beautiful
1:44 my guy straight up died  Edit : nvm he lived 1:52
. Love.
. Love.
This album is literally great. The music video makes it so much better.
Hello Bruno Mars do you think you can be brooks in one piece live action?
Can’t wait to hear the full album!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mans went from catch a grenade for ya to throw a grenade at ya
These Mars-.Paak-Silk Sonic collabs are the best thing to happen to music in 20 years.
Ya thats why I'd like bruno Mars cuz he didn't , curses
Muito bom!
C l a s s I c one
This is a fucking vibe, YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
the best album of all time
Damnnnbb
I started laughing pretty damn hard when Anderson was spotted lying motionless on the floor, but him coming back from that just had me in tears!
0:31  This bitch got me pay her rent 😂
Song hit different when you can relate 😪
What a fucking duo.
Memphis own Brother Whalum in the Background
anderson paak could play bobby womack we need a movie bruno could be sam cooke
The 70's vibes this gave me is so amazing
Amazing!!!
And now i am 14
Bruno mars was my fav singer ever since i was 7
Elongated version of(she belong to the streets)
The S.I.M.P. getting crimson-capsuled anthem!!😎
Bruno und seine Jungs haben im kleinen Finger so viel Rhythmus... wow... dagegen wirkt ein Weißer so starr wie ein Hackstock!
Idk why saw this before
Shit! this is the best collaboration I’ve seen in a long time!
Silk sonic is just iconic mannn😭😭😭😭😭
So they copied the wake up in the sky video with slight adjustments
Chuck e cheese's nice fact Bruno Mars but I think five children got missing there
I love your voice Bruno. Yes I am a pathetic fan but I can’t help it   One day I am going to find my own Bruno Mars 🥰😃☺️
Literally the only thing i'm wondering is how they're doing the cords on the ground  like- literally they are so straight
Massive Temptations influence on this one
Dat niga bruno mars is a fucking superstar 🤘🏽
0:31 this going to be a meme
This is the modern interpretation of very well made songs in the footsteps of the O’Jays, Temptations and more than that. Mastwepiece !!  now I'm a fan of Silky & Soul Greetings from Germany
This is one of the best singing groups I’ve seen since I was in a singing group back in the 50s 🤗
This song is HEAT
Just love this song! The rhythm is great! These guys are funny and serious, all at once!
that high note that starts at 2:45 😍
Bruno the only dude I’d let call a woman a bitch, he catched too many grenades apparently 💀💀
This is soooo smooothhhhh❤️😭🔥
O ANDERSON NO CHÃO E DEPOIS VOLTANDO COM TUDO EU TÔ PASSANDO MAL AKFJHSKJDHLSFGLSGAD
When the '70s and the 2020s collaborate 👌
I love IT!
le son est exceptionnel
Smooth just MF. Smooth
Ah, Bruno, Bruno, it's unlovely to advertise smoking. Think for yourself, your videos are also watched by children. If someone taught your children to smoke, would you like it?
ol bruno look like he been hittin the dust
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
크으.... 개머시써
Fr
Remember fellas she not yours she for the streets
Fuckin loveeee these two
This track has grown on me like a rash. Can't wait to see Silk Sonic live <3
If u Fall in love with nostalgia and miss 70 , 80 just chill and listen to this guy
I like the music but I still wish bruno mars would do even just a bit more of music like talking to the moon
🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃 This song has some incredible vibes
Banger
This is a good  song
I’m bored
We need to start a worldwide war to free ourselves from this Covid madness. Destroy media, WHO and governments!
🤣🤣❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Repeat it ❤️
Love the 70s vibes of this music.
anyone can answer me? Where's philip lawrence?

What a smooth choreography ❤
His songs are a perfect mix of 19s and 20s Amazing aesthetic vibe..

ART!!!!!! OMG
2:43 Michael Jackson is back!
Boa pra caralho essa música, Bruno Mars é o CARA!!!

Listen to this performance here!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukusXCfmPtY  Original Groove Banda
The most respectful “she belong to the streets” ever
2:36 hits a cigarette then hits that note without exhaling. That inhuman.
Probably the best song I heard all year
😍❤ much love and respect from Egypt 🇪🇬 ❤
I love this song... it reminds me the RNB 2000s❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🌼🌺🌻🌺🌻
How can I give this masterpiece 1000000000 likes
yasalam
*Bruno* "Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me, now I gotta give you back to the city oh you got me."  *Future* "She belongs to the shkreets."
These outfits are so sexy good lord
My mum would have like this to bits even the whole presentation to the end!!! Thank you for this gem of a song with this hilarious video !
SHE BELONGS TO THE STREETS!
Bruno makes me so proud
YEAHHH
This might just be his best song yet
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
1:16 why does this hit so hard
Now realize the lyrics in the description...
she belong to everybody ooh
Anyone know the backstory to this song? I looked it up and found nothing interesting.
How fun 😭
VIDEO OF THE YEAR. THE WAY MY MANS IS IN THE DEAD POSE IS JUST TOO MUCH. GREAT SONG
I need a 10 hour remix but it's just Anderson .Paak saying This Bitch
I luv this song, Brazil here for all redpillazed guys Jesus bless us
i prefer not saying the b word in it maybe like ''this trick'' but its still great
For three minutes I forgot all of my problems, but nothing last forever!!! ❤❤❤
NICE SONG KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK   MUSIC LYRICS SA APPROVED
Cuz she belong to the streets
0:57
This is so sick.. Perfection..........
door open, window open, its breezy as fuck in here
🕊️💟
I would have love to hear at least one “she belongs to the streets”
What an eargasm
Bruno & Anderson .paak go together like PB&J💜💛💜💛
Dannngg the percussion are so damn in the moment very precisely queed
when A. Paak slides in frame at 0:30 secs i lost most of my shit....lol
Let's hit 60M 🥺
Love ittttttttt 😭😭😭😭😭🖤🦋
‘She belongs to everybody’ would be probably the most classy way to say “That bi#ch is a whore.” lololol
They did the 70's vibe very very well
This song is a perfect representation of every cat owner relationship with their cat.
What rubbish as soon as the disgusting  words fly out of their mouths its ditch this and good riddance time! what brutes and not humane to try to sing disgusting lyrricks.  Get lost cause real men are humble with respect and never do nonsence like that.   Real men have manners and never need to swear and tantrum Yuk!
the music itself is a masterpiece but the choreography makes it so pleasing to watch! whoever came up with this concept is a genius
0:32
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 mo
what a MASTERPIECE !!!
This song is fire 🔥
Imagine how nostalgic this would be in a few years
Este hombre nunca dejará de sorprendernos! Amo su estilo retro 😍.
I love the music, how they composed the sounds together and the 3 part harmony.  Everyone was blended in their own note. Awesome.
This a damn masterpiece
Kings ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This music is straight fire! Timeless piece!
I was smokin Benson & Hedges in the 70s. This song made me time travel.
This goes hard
The best song ever
From "I want to be a billionaire" to "paying her bills" 🤣
1:35
Waiting for Zayn and Bruno collab.
0:32 imelda marcos 1:46 ninoy aquino  truly a pilipino
A. Paak  Of the Benzo,the Benzo🎵
2:55
I need to go to sleep
This is the greatest song of all time.  Drums and bass are 10 out of 10. I belly laugh every time i listen/watch this. Choreography super tight.  And these dudes are in character/ acting pros just owning the parts.  Excellence in their craft.
HERCULES HERCULES  😫👏
This song & video is perfectly hilarious and great sounding. What gets me is the comedic point of it, like this could have been talking points in a funny conversation or  in a comedian's standup set. I love it!!! 🥰😍🥰😍
Bruno looking like my landlord from the Bronx.
I accidentally watched this on 2x speed and that shit was funny af
Incredible
The new anthem for Men's Rights
These foos... good joking song
POV: u typed up the b got me paying her rent. dont lie
This is the smoothest "she belongs to the streets" ever
This song could pass for a comedy regardless of the situation being sang to be tragedy!😂
I have been binge-lisening his music sadly, I took his music for granted and in retrospect I have never been wrong in my life. What an unique talen.. in my defense I would say"better late than naver".
Red Pill Wins!
<3 very good  omg.
Hit it waaayyy outta the park AGAIN!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰😍❤ #SheBelongToEverybody! 😆😆😆😆😆 #GiveHerBackToTheCity! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ô parceria q deu certo, viu!
These Guys are bringing back that ole school feeling. Something we can relate too! Each song has a story to tell. Reminds me of the Temptations. They are holding the title Album of the year😊
“runnin round my whole crib like it’s chucky cheese “  Bruno funny asf 😂
Get my baby off the floor! 😱😩
God some old Skool feeling to it  Better then the rap crap
I’m feeling like him
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 nothing left to say... Musical Geniuses!
Another great and timely jam

How the fuck isn’t Bruno mars not verified???
You just know they were dying laughing while putting this video together

Yes I’m loving this one here.
35,000 for a bitch that got her kids running around my house never can be me 😅
who hurt u baby sksksk
He looked like the weekend tho
This B🤬! 😂 🤣🤧
Maybe you shouldn’t leave the door open.
she belongs to the streets
Anderson .Paak playing dead on the ground is the greatest moment in music video history
Every body: "singing Andreson paak: uff
Pica
this vibe. THIS vibe 😩
"THIS.BITCH.Got me" best qoute ever.  😆 LOL
La mejor aaaaaaaaa👍🏽
🔥🔥🔥🔥😘😘
If this album and song don’t get album and song of the year I’m gonna be pissed
If he doesn't play the bio pic of Jackie Wilson, I will be shocked.
This is a masterpiece
Bruno went from catching that grenade to throwin that grenade
Muito bom ver artistas voltando nas raízes. Viva a música negra!
most aesthetic way to send bitch back to the street 🗿
We need another Super Bowl appearance!!!!
It's how Anderson came back from the dead and started re-singing again for me.....🤣🤣🤣
I've always been a fan of Bruno Mars but I never knew who the other guys are what are there name and who should I know?
Love it!!!! I’m here for it!!!!❤️❤️👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
basically proof that they do infact make music like this anymore.
OMG!!! You can Smoke out my window dis anytime Bruno/PAAK🔥 🔥 🔥 MUCH ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️

even if i didnt smoke i have glassy eyes in this music video
Lol lol. Hercules !!
I had to put this song on repeat, frfr.
This is funny. Reminds me of the old days :)
This should be an nft
I'd really like to know who are these people that dislike track so much that they actually selected dislike
There always something new with his music.
Bruh WHOEVER made this video is my creative thinking hero
Damn Bruno Mars turned into Snoop Mars

You are the best im not kidding🪂
SMOKING OUT THE WINDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
Aşığım ya sana ondan   Because ı love  you and music thats problem mannn for me
This video makes me so happy
now we know she belongs to tha streets.
it was never yours, it was only your turn, focus on yourself king
Omgosh ❤️❤️❤️could listen to this over over again ...
this the same nigga that used to “catch a granade”
cmon bruno ya already know…SHE BELONGS TO THE STREETS #CITYBOYSUP #HOODVILLEFAM
Refreshing to hear real talent, reminds me of the Motown sound.
This ish 🤣
I like this song, but I would of loved it better if they left the word “b*t*h” out.
I love how Bruno jus out here having fun with this music stuff…low key this joint 🔥
16 mil MSOL ou MANGINA deram deslike kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Anderson's first "this bitch" is like having a smoke outside a bar, asking him for a light, then have him going off on why he's there.  Amazing!!!
but i wanna dieeeee
This hits that much harder if you listen in sequence on the album.  To go from "Fly like Me" to "After Last Night" (Bootsy _still_ sounds great.  Good on him) then this really sells the _This._  _Bitch._
This song is everything. Those lyrics is my life. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruno & Paak y'all should put Freddie Gibbs on the remix bruh will kill it
found my 2021 favorite song
MEGABAND
I love it been there bout time we hear some real thought music.
Finally, an anthem for all the sugar daddy's out there 😅😍
Whenever I see reels going “this bitch” for some reason my mind goes “on fire” like “this girl is on fire” from girl on fire by Alicia Keys
💕💕💕
I listened to Kyungsoo's(d.o. exo) suggestion..it's great
Is it wrong I laughed when Bruno came with this bitch 😂
He reminds me of mj
This is my favorite Bruno Mars era yet
Men bruno mars you have amazing voice but wait there more that dude can do beast dance hahahahahaha.
Nem o Bruno Mars escapou da Gaia meus amigos, imagina nós 😂😂
When bruno hits that reach back and point after this bitch i got a flashback to some old street dude telling a story  on the corner... glorious
Still paying the rents but for the streets
The thing these men are doing for music is legendary. In a time where music is all over the place these men are making classics  with a modern twist and they complement one another so well nobody asked for this duo but it's what we needed
Please tell me that 1:16 here is a reference to 'The Nutty Professor's' dinner scene. I can't stop laughing watching this and hearing Eddie Murphy say 'Hercules, Hercules, Hercules.'
My kids love this song 🎧 crazy BM always making billions on YouTube
I would rather live with bad lungs than live with a broken heart
Listening to this while smoking out the window is like :DDDDD
Love this song
He went from catching a grenade to throwing it back
This really is a sugar daddy song
"Give A Man A Gift, and see who you messing with"  -- Nas.
"Don't money where your heart is" My Mom.
1:46 Anyone. -- Showed his whole A$$ with this one!
Bruno mars has turned heel, this is way better than heel cena
The stories in those songs are so expressive and clear u could make a whole animatic on it!! XD
The lyrics of this otherwise wonderful song are extremely offensive to women. Shocked nobody is writing this in the comments.
This is automatically iconic!
Smooth ❤️
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib  Like it's Chuck E.

3:03 am                     29/11/2021, cramming for my report tomorrow while this song is on loop <33
The character development of Bruno Mars is unmatched, From "I'd catch a grenade for ya " to "This Bitch"
11/2021👠👜💍 smokin out the window.
So everytime I watch this song, I am captivated by something different every single time: the choreography. The color scheme. The coordination. The music's flow. The smoothness. I am drawn in every single time! And makes doing chores that much more tolerable when I have this playing in the background 😅😅😅
1:33 Man Down! MAN DOWN!!!
Yall was not ready for this
am I the only one who was HOLLERING through the whole video? Their sass, the moves and little jokes...so simple yet so hilarious
I was never a Bruno Mars fan until I heard the words THIS BI$$$ haha thought about my ex. Had me smoking out the window. Thank you Bruno lol
Omg bringing back that sexy soul train era, I am so feelin' this ❤️🙏
1:33
Te espero mirando por la ventana ! Te amo Bruno 💖
El hombre tirado es lo máximo jajajaja
Awesome video. It's so perfectly choreographed and performed. I love it 3000
I love the smooth, mellow vibes of this song. The old school dance moves and matching clothes of Mars and his crew, take me back to my high school days. Lyrics are both smart and revealing. Men can find themselves on the wrong side of love during the trials and tribulations of modern day dating and this new generation of women who can have other plans for why they 're with them.
Swagger on G Pistol on me  towel on neck it's heat flowing from me I be the sea as oceans trying to be clear as cellophane better yet holy water trying to be clear as can be no shade no deciet just all of me
Need cardi b on this track...a women needs to explain herself because this ain't right we love Bruno 💙
If only they said " She belong to the streets" after " Belonged only to me" that would have broken the internet for sure
This lowkey has snl vibes
🤣❤
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief   This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mmh) But I was wrong  'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window(Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo)  Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

I know you’re here from Rihanna’s story
i'm all about classic rock, blues, and twenty minute guitar solos.    and even i think these guys are awesome.
amazing music. no complain whatsoever but is it necessary to add bitch to the lyrics?
This is beyond perfect
Cool... By the way 👇 https://youtu.be/ny1MV8bAF8k
I love it!! Really!
뒤에 두분은 누구에요?? 궁금해요
anderson paak playing dead killed me

how to say "she's for the streets" but in a classy way
Yo this man has a decade of brilliant music 💯

Anyone who don't like this song be tripping 😒

Love the new song
51M em 3 semanas, que obra de arte que você fez Bruno! ❤️🔥🤯💨
Definitely buying this album!!!!
I remember him being bigger than that he must started eating salads and crap
This bitch é minha religião
he's truly legendary! his music is just gold and never gets old
😍😍😍😍😍🥵🥵
People out here only talking about Bruno makes me so sad you guys don’t appreciate Anderson and the chores like you should! You’re definitely not here for art but for the artist because if you really appreciate art you’ll give more credit to all of them!!!
I wish I have their dancing skills
bruno has a jack sparrow vibe in this,right?
i love your style guys!
So amazing!!! On repeat!
The best song stating she’s for the streets
This is such a good combination. Love them! ❤. They make amazing music together. 🔥
😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎶🎶🎵🎵🎵💓💓💓💓💓
Wow.
"God Damn." - Marisol 2021
Bruno Mars' songs age like fine wine
I love the way their music makes me feel!
Love this song.
Grenade but R&B soul  / funk
It's like grenade but less depressed sounding
Grenade by Bruno Mars in another multiverse
Grenade in another multiverse
Falsetto is super powered
This song is addictive for some reason idk why it so soothing my goddd this is so GOOD~
Nice melody, lyrics perhaps too gangster rap for this look ?
Great video, not like some.
They got me at the feet stomps
So funny when he tells “Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die” and dramaticly falls on the floor lol
She's just like maths, either 2+2 or 2×2 = 4 the streets
Ok . Sooo.                        When will I be able to stop listening to this. I have been replaying this over and over again. Someone help.
Anderson .Paak been national treasure for a hot minute now
that bass though
Anderson Paak verse is best
🔥🔥🔥🔥 THANKS FOR BRING BACK SOUL WITH A MODERN FEEL
meanwhile snoop dogg:  smoke weed out the window

A ✨V.I.B.E✨
Bruno Mars 👋👋👋 is the best singer! I salute idoL 🙌  From: The Philippines❤️❤️❤️
The lyrics already had me weak but paak made my lung collapse, layin on the damn floor 😭
cigarettes… sure . that’s what they are implying …
Who heard this on tiktok?
I died when Anderson fainted and popped back up like it was nothing
These are music yes
I really don’t know why when he was on the floor I thought he was like a step
Its the lean in when he say chucky cheez for me 😂😂😂😍
Video of the year
Alright here go the remix y'all -  "This" "bitch" got me spanking my meat, instead of her skins while I'm paying her rent, and all the while she's riding in my Benzooo ohhhh this bitch gotsta goooooo ooohh"
Anderson Paak is amazing! I’m glad this duo introduced me to him💯
But I, hope your trifling a** walking around bare foot in these streets 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🗣🗣🗣🗣good 🎵

This is actually a good song for SIMPS!😁
Love the Chocolate Suede
This song hits my heart ❤️ 😬😘
Glad to see Bruno out here doin his thing. Fam a hell of an artist and teaming up with Paak was a good move.
plot twist: Anderson .Paak was killed after the scene
Those are some talented individuals
We need response song  BAD!
I done listened to this song on repeat least 20 times lol
Anderson and Bruno go together like diamonds and emeralds. Absolute perfection on a whole different level.
"Wait a minute this love started out so tender.. so sweet but know it's go me" ✨REPEATING THIS DANM SONG~✨
This is the chillest cigarette ad ever
Ha! He’s got Stevie wonder tatted on his chest! Definitely an ol’ soul 🤣
懐かしい感じ🤔 カッコイイ✨👍
ill never get tired of this song!
Their lyrics are so funny. I feel like their paying homage to the 70s/80s sound but still having a lot of modern fun with it lyrically and being tongue in cheek about it. Bruno definitely had that classic sound but Anderson brought a lot of interesting writing and musicality and I think that’s what makes this a perfect duo.
hey welcome back, because i know it's not ur first time here
Okay am waiting for the tour !!!
You guys are amazing keep on doing what you're doing you are the best.
Bruno is absolute Gold. He reminds me of the funkadelic my dad listened to. Zapp & Rodger, Kool & Gang, EW&F, looooove the sound. Timeless music
Cant Get ENOUGH!💣💥💥💥🔥
simp anthem
Iono why but when the camera did the lil bop when Paak was stamping, my face screwed up like yh this shit raw fr
This song hits hard at 3 AM
:D
I want to hear a whole album with these two. And imagine Andre 3000 too! Boy!
oh my god the best xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Enaak kaliii lagunyaaa 💕💕
Who else has this on repeat? I am currently folding laundry and I am listening to this amazing song!
Anderson .paak silk Sonic Bruno mars lindo canciones musicales voz te quiero muchos Bruno mars 😘
Anyone else feels that there was a slight change in music, in spootify?
1:36 me working over 16 hr shift offshore clocking out!
Bringing back 70's vibes. Hats off to Bruno and the gang.
literally playing their album on repeat
Perfeição define❤️❤️❤️💖💖💖💖
Goddammit I want a cigarette now.
Tyler did it first 🥱
Masterpiece
I use to think a Bruno was a different type of man with true swag and love until this song. Now he just like every other man who disrespects. Dang
When he said THIS BITCH i felt that
Hercules, Hercules, Hercules!
When Bruno Mars sad Chuck E. Cheese’s it took me out 😭😭
I loved your style from day 1 love old school Motown 😍😍
Omg love this song and the style bringing it back baby growing up on Motown this is hot this is the new Motown very sexy caliente!!!
Somehow that song is so funny to me cuz it looks like a parody this man simply never miss
Not only is the music great... these brothers are hilarious....great video!!!
My man is done, he ain't catching no more grenades And why was the other one laying on the floor, like just laying down Dang they really said "she belongs to the streets"
damn girls even got bruno fucked up
Well I have to give her back to the city! So am smokin out the window! Top vibes 🕺🏽 Lol
Whether it’s about leaving a door open, skating or smoking out a window, this guy can make a great song out of anything 😂
That’s what we called good music oh lord 😔🙌🏾
So the cigarette company pay this guy to encourage viewers (youngsters) to start smoking this cr....p again, to make this Cr....p popular again? out of my play list.
damn, in all of Bruno's songs.. he keeps meeting horrible women :(
It’s a banger!
This is soul baby :) love this...thx.
this is the smoothest way to tell someone they're for the streets
I hear little bit of it early young Michael Jackson come out in this song
muy pro
This song plus Taylor’s album came out at the perfect time
feel pharell behind that
THIS IS WHAT I CALLED STANDARD
50 million views and i'm prolly half of them
They're pretending to be an early 70s band, which makes me wonder: is this a joke? A parody? I can't take it seriously. They're like kids playing dress up.
Lovin it! new music with an old school flavor.
What happened to you
It’s effortlessly cool. Love how he just does his thing these days. Makes him a real long term player. But he really needs to learn to smoke ha
Imagine The Weeknd on this song
I have no words to say about this song. That's awesome. Guys you rock.  Amazing!! I'm from Brazil 🇧🇷 and I got to say that I can't wait to see you here guyd
Pls have a uk tour
great 😀👍
Está música me recuerda a los Jackson five y a Michael!!! ( Sin el cigarrillo, claro 😄)🌎🇦🇷
Song to all the brothers there’s life after a bad apple you’ve bitten into!♿️
These guys are my favorites right now...I absolutely love love love them....just awesomeness....
sounds like tavares
These collaborations are just the best thing happening in the music industry nowadays. This vibe they're giving to us is absolutely priceless!
Everything Bruno Mars touches turns to gold!
Kool & The Gang is back !!!!  AMAZING
I am older and don't care for a lot of the new music that is out, but Bruno Mars is a musical genius.  He always is a showman with his combination of vocals and dance moves.  This video is great definitely a tribute to the early seventies soul music, which is one of my favorites!!!  Bruno Mars keep on doing your thing with your bad self!!!
thank you bruno and anderson for this master pieace keep em coming
Only if people understood the real meaning of the song
E o cara
Foda MARAVILHOSO  como ele Bruno Mars
This is just brilliant...Golden Bruno !!!
“She belong to everybody” 💯 be safe kings
Must have spent 35 45 thousand dollars on crack Cocaine. Also have a huge problem with a lil thing called Crystal Meth Amphetamine.
Let me buy a damn shirt causeeee dammittt this my song!!! They probably talking about me tho….😅🤦🏾‍♀️
they smoke it out this song bigtime
This right here is classic. It will be played on a craft heading towards other galaxies. We won't be there but this song will keep making them ask themselves how must've been the time back then while this jam released.
1:36 is my favourite bit
i love this song so much
temptations is back
"she for the streets" but romantically
Chucky Cheese
It's the way Anderson comes in with" dis bish got me payin her rent"......that's my favorite part. The way he twists his mouth to emphasize the words and the way he flicks his hands with the cigar 😅😅😅😅😅😅🥺🤗 Love the Temptations vibe......
Fun fact! Bruno mars is filipino.
Bruno Mars ain’t simpin no more
YOU GOTTA LOVE THIS SONG .  ITS ANOTHER ONE OF BRUNO & THE CREWS 'UNIQUE STYLE OF SINGING .DID HE SAY 'BITCH IN THE SONG 🎵 🤣 😂🤣 🤪 😂 ❤❤❤
LETS RETURN TO OLD TIMES PLEASEEEEE :DD!!!!!!!!
se las dedico a mis nenes los BTS :D
This is full of entertainment and authenticity
What a melody and lyrics it brings us to 80s
I love it:) great song
Lots of accu-tune going on, but still a fun song.
Who hurt Bruno , he went from “ leave the door open to, shut the damn thing.”
They ain't playing
Bruno is sooooo smooth
We need more quality songs like this!. Truthful with a strong message!.💯👍🏿
WOW
When anderson paak fall out and make it just in time to hit you with the "this.... bitch " got me dying 🤣 😭 😂
Love this song, but I realized that the chick never forced them to pay for the diamonds, her rent.  It just sounds like the bruthas got played. Why would you willingly pay for someone's rent, their kids, and excessive material things? Was it because of 'good loving'? Was it worth it?   Bruthas (and sistas), know your worth and look for someone who doesn't want you simply for your money or atleast who brings you more peace/joy than stress lol.  Still, great song and harmonies 😁
Best album of 2021 no cap
The Single Mother warning right here!!
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

Essa música me desperta um tanto de sentimentoooo 😍🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Friend: what's wrong?  Me: This B*tch Got Me Paying The Rent!! 😣😣😣😣
Redpill feelings hahahaha
Bruno Mars and the Weeknd really took “I was born in the wrong generation” to another level
Почему это хочется пересматривать?! Из раза в раз. Стиль, мазафака.
"I'm so cold" double meaning like he's cold cause he's alone and cold as he's done with this sh*t and has no more sympathy
Congratulations Bruno Mars, this is gonna break ur previous records 👌🎊
who fucked this man over 🤣 went from talking bout love to this bitch 🤣🤣
Meme potential of 0:32 is off the charts
this song is a whole mood
Shout out to the back up vocalists so underated

The best thing to happen to music in a really really long time.
Anderson Paak! 😍😍😍😍😍😍👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾🎙🎙🎙
My name is Hercules
This man lives in the 80s
This is one of my least new favorite songs I’ve ever heard and I will listen to it over and over again
Im dying the way he pops back into the camera view it’s everything Im not gonna lie Im gonna rewatch this 10000000000000000 times and so should you cause it’s greatness
love this song
Anderson Paak met Suga !
Eu sou completamente apaixonada ❤️🇧🇷
The way he fell and got back up lol love it ❤
Excellent song Mars!
All this needs is Dave Chappelle playing Prince.
My old man told me I play this everyday...and it's true multiple times a day!! Fantastic Song even got my Pops playing it too!! 🤣🤣🤷🏾‍♀️
sorry to say, the song isnt great. >.<
Simply great,  for its powerful music!
A song to warn the young men to not be simps. I love it
I was expecting 'she belongs to the street'
My favorite .... Bruno & Anthony... what more can one ask for...
Here after tiger shroff’s reel🇮🇳
From Anderson Paak laying dead on the ground then springing back up, the camera doing a close up when they sing "this Bitch", Anderson Paak saying that he hopes she finds what she needs but he also hopes her trifling ass is barefoot into these streets, and Bruno Mars releasing her to the city... This song / video is catchy, climactic, funny, and relatable. I've grown to really enjoy it!
anderson keeps popping in frame singing DIS BITCH 😂
is that lebron james? hes really good in dancing than flopping
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🎤🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸📻🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸📀📀📀📀📀📀💿💿💿💿💿🎹🎹🎹🎹🎹🎹

Why is this so good?
Shouldn’t have left that door open, fellas 🤷🏻‍♀️
Omg! Omg! Omg! anderson paak and BTS collab?? That's huge for sure. Waiting to confirm that wonderful collab in the future.
“She beeeeelongs to everybody, she’s for the streets!” #Facts
The lyric is just Future vibes 😂😂😂😂
i wish this music was infinity
I'm an OLD SCHOOL 60's 70's & 80's R&B fan, but this track got me listening over and over.
The lyrics are so relatable…
현존 최고의 아티스트 같음... 왜 이리 잘하냐~~!! 뭘 하든 다 잘함
Bruno mars went from catching granades to throwing them
1:33 issamooooooood
This is an ad that I didn't skipped.
all this choreography, but i won't be surprised if anderson .paak playing dead was an improvised bit lmao
dream girl ? some gesture like gay.
0:49 "Sssss....smokin out the window" I love this part.
So much loveeee for this songg ❤❤❤❤
Love 0:32😍
Sem o cigarro nota 10

I wish there was a collaboration between Bruno, The Weeknd, and Paak.
Theyre song is a bop, really.
Damn they got Yoel Romero in there

2x playback speed 👀
New Old School ❤❤
No dislikes  I wish it could to stay like that  I'm already fantasing over this my gooooooooooood (pisces)
This is beautifully hilarious 😂
To be honest, the first time I heard this song, the first few secons, I was thinking that she made him smoke outside the house and he was comlaining about it. Oh the naivity!
i love this video
How tf did they not bust their ass laughing while filming/recording this.
Here before it gets famous and hits 1B views.
this guy can never make a bad song
Bruno Mars is such a fine man
When Anderson said "This Bitch.." I knew it got real  & I immediately got my Benson and went to the window LOLOL
dude this is crazy 🔥
sweetie!!!
I can never get enough of Bruno and Anderson 🙌🏿🙌🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🎶🎶🎶🚬🚬🚬
Let me be clear when I say that this is one of the greatest music videos ever
“Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die” proceeds to lay on the floor face down. I felt that so much you have no idea I love that line and I love thing whole music video
never can say goodbye by the jackson 5 is typing….
I will pay any amount of money to see this live
This shit will be timeless. Watch!
This is music. That's it.
I've listened to thus 3 times and barely noticed Paak on the floor 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hi 😊
Anderson .Paak playing dead on the ground is the greatest moment in music video history RIGHT THERE!
From " come over baby, I have wine and purple haze" to "get out, you human living rat"
While everyone is being crazy about charts and rankings, these dudes be chilling, living their best lives and doing what they love
"How could she do this to me?" Because you left the door the door open, that's why.
1:51 me when
I came here to remind me what jada is actually like
This video is so addicting idk why
They never disappoint, WOW
s l a y !
i hate smoking with a passion but this song is sooooo comfy
*My husband: “what ever happened to ‘just the way you are’?!” 😹😹

naparito lamang ako dahil sa mga marcos memes
This song is ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Good
It really can’t get better than this! He knows how to bring any era back and they are always amazing choices.
He said “look here baby I hope you find what ever you need but I also hope your trifling ass is barefoot in these streets “I died 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is so good
Playing dead with a lit cigarette perfectly in hand. *chef’s kiss*
No longer leave the door open it's like lock it
I definitely love his music
Ultimate Anti Simp song of this century so far!
Don’t go to hell. God loves you and that’s why he sent his son Jesus to die a criminal’s death for you. He accepted humiliation and death so that wouldn’t have to die for your sins. All you have to do is accept him today! Don’t let the devil win family. Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior today  I love you and more importantly Jesus loves you,  Goodnight.
Cringed when he said bitch
"Not be dramatic but I wanna die" *Proceeds to fucking die*
This is the best song I heard yet
Nice song, even better message.   Important for those who need to hear it.
nothing is as raw as paak going  "THIS BITCH"
nah my man went to simp to pimp😎🤕
Y’all talking about Bruno but keep forgetting it’s not just him, it’s silk sonic
is this the final music video??
Dope old school concept
Man these guys exude class.. I oppose smoking but this is art.
It's  his fault he was the one who left the door open
Why is 1:18-1:23 so clean
Esto si es musica y no ese reguetton
If y’all think this is catchy and funny, check out Oran “Juice” Jones’  song “The Rain.” It’s an old classic and I feel like this song was partly inspired by it
I bet dude with hat got them white spots on his front teeth, and Bruno lol azz be singing his butt off
I wanna know who hurt Bruno cuz I felt the SOUL In that “B I T C H”
Anderson on the floor was pure gold. Anderson popping back into the camera on beat was PLATINUM!! 😂😂

1KK views it's only me, myself and I on repeat   hahaha  So f***ing good!    damn!!!
Quem deu deslike merece se agredido
guy I accidentally clicked the doslike button🤹💀💀💀💀

🙏🏻 🇱🇦
Omg this video is amazing. And the song is 🔥🔥🔥
Demais
Vamos aplaudir!
Amazing!
Fuck me this GROOVEs
No one is going to talk about Bruno’s voice at 3:02 !?
He looks like ..Sammy Davis jr…
"Not to be dramatic but I wanna die" my favourite part 🤣🤣🤣 love these guys!!!! Pure TALENT! Thank you for keeping great music alive
00:49 ssssssspokin analdomiru
I love this song!
Fly and funny AF 🤘🏽
My neighbour's been listening to this song so much, even I miss his ex
It’s ridiculous that they never get the credit they deserve! This better be a Grammy machine next Grammies!!
daddy uwu
This is "she belongs to the streets" the musical
Bruno Mars tá parecendo o Reginaldo Rossi kkkk
Am I the only one that can relate to this song? Lol it’s like the more I listen to this song the more I think about this b*tch that used me!
Dayum I remember when he’d catch a granade for her
Dang who broke his heart
Bruno is so saucy, the way he moves makes me feel things 🥵
Old school rnb is back
Oh my god their moves are like hipnosis
Boy they looking like The Temps in that video lol
i quite smoking until i heard this song
0:11
Ça déchire !!! Et le clip est parfait. Les codes sont respectés, magique.
No one   Me. *_DIS B*TCH_*
Who broke Bruno’s heart after all the love songs he sung?
Bruno Mars     SUPER.👍👍👍👍
This song is 🔥
I love this song so much!!! Definitely, the best song of the year!
The choreo is fuckin amazing in this. I always love Bruno dancing n singing his lungs out
Anderson Paak what a discovery ! He's AMAZING ! This duo was much needed .. Thank you Bruno !
Bruno really went from leaving the door open to changing the lock
Red pill
Old school R&B meets MGTOW :-D Anderson Pak - just the best
amazing
Listened to their new album at 9pm. I guess you could say I spent an Evening with Silk sonic
They are stupid rich and I cant even buy myself a decent car. Not fair.
Good for the soul
The video and song is pure fucking gold. All rise the new dynamic duo!
did his wifey leave him?
i love you guys so much pls
Kanye's smoking out the window about Kim and Pete probably lol
I find it very sad that there are more women smoking cigars.  Big Tobacco has always targeted people, especially women and girls to start smoking.    More and more people should know that tobacco smoking causes a lot of health problems.    Please choose a healthier job and career path!
He will be throwing that grenade back quite soon
.don't be shy, drop the name.
I love how Anderson Paak just pops into the frame whenever he feels like it.
Why so smooth
I just woke up back in the 70's!   REAL SINGING.  REAL INSTRUMENTS ACTUALLY BEING PLAYED.  REAL MUSIC. Takes me right back to my childhood. Silk Sonic, more please!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Im happily married and I sing this song with my chest like Im really mad at somebody 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂. Bruno is nice, but y'all need to stop disrespecting Anderson like he had nothing to do with the whole album
Got her bad  kids runnin it is like chuck-e-cheese
After watching this shit , I picked up a cigarette out the sidewalk and smoked that thang up
This is not a music video  This is a performance  at a live show 👏 🙌
I bought chocolate when my mom bought chocolate.
Music videos need to back to the laid back style and not rely so much on the “video hoes”.
Video of the year
Sounds like Bootsy in the beginning!
This song make wanna be A B**** 😌
Finalmente quebraram o coração do Bruno de novo, aeeeeeeeh
So vintage istg
AR Rehman wants to know your location
Bootsy Collins at the start confirms that Bruno Mars bootsy Collins collab can happen
Am I the only one who thinks that the "this bitch got me paying her rent" is the most iconic line in the song?
bruno and anderson are a fabulous duo
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY EQUALLY SHARE THE STAGE? ABSOLUTE POWER DUO.
Good music, Bruno Mars hits all the songs they make !!!!
Also the fact that their cigarettes are actually lit while performing 😭
1:45 he just layin there😭😭😭
This is fun music old school….Funkadelic’s back in the days. Who can say “the other night you squeezing me tight calling me Hercules”…….dope lines.
Wow🤩🎵🎶🤤😚👋
I’m with it. Me, out the window: 🚬 🤦🏾‍♂️
the first man's this bitch sounded gentle then next man sounded like reached back and called that bitch back from 1962
I loved it ! <3
When gold meets gold!!!
Metal head here and digging this jam… Pretty sure this song was influenced by my ex. She does belong to everybody 😂
😂😂😂
This video is fuckin classic. From the ol school feel to Anderson.Paak jumping up after playing dead. The song......GREAT!!!!
"Not to be dramatic but I want to diiiiiiiie!" 😂
MUSIC ISN'T DEAD....
Some mouse: Its Charles entertainment cheese to you sir.
While everyone is being crazy about charts and rankings, these dudes be chilling, living their best lives and doing what they love
inb4 It gets copied by Kpop
Got me Lmao while being Impressed from their Amazing Performance Hahahhaa
Got her kids running around like it’s Chuck E. Cheese HAHAHA
I'll be that one guy. Bruno Mars music is annoying, his song on Google Fi makes me want to throw my phone up to the moon where this dude's head seems to be floating.
I love this song
It's the Anderson Paak playing dead for me😂😂
This song tickles my butthole
Certified classic!!!👌📀💯
Haven't liked anything bruno mars since locked out of heaven. This slaps hard
This song is brilliant!! Their singing, the passion and the music style… Wow!!!!
This dude is singlehandedly reviving the age of disco.
I love Anderson paak he's so dramatic😭
I just love that these guys have decided to extend arguably the best era of music... the 70s
I like  the musis. Very nice brunos Max. The Beth the  yes  2021  very so good
Who else saw Sammy Davis jr. in bruno’s music video?
This the funniest shit I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂 but that THIS BITCH part strong asf
Watching this makes me want to dance while smoking a cigarette...
it's November 26th, 2021, let’s see who’s listening to this masterpiece!
This Song Is So Addicting
Consummate professional. Great tribute to 70’s genre.

Because nobody did it😩  Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mmh) But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

"Not to be dramatic...but i wanna diiiie!" I love Andy's dramatic ass...lol
this is waht happens "when you leave the door open"😏
"screaming Hercules"
"I'm in disbelief"
Bet you wish you didn't leave that door open...
Best thing I've seen on a long time.  Smooth yet hilarious.
I adore how this is all set up like a 70s music video including the outfits, the stage, the cinematography, the lighting. Even Bruno changed his look to look exactly like an old Motown star. I swear he just keeps reinventing himself.
Wow, all four of these men got played by the same girl. She must be a professional.
Hilarious Anderson😂😂😂
My shit!! Love this song
i thought its fake but REAL cigarettes! man hope the stage didn't get burn
Lyrics shouldve been: she belongs to the streets
go listen to my new song, squid games season 2 - Baegera
Watched in 240p to get that 80s vibe
This album is gonna be a damn masterpiece
Y’all killed this 🔥🔥🔥
SNL skit?
💓
two fantastic african-asian talents
She belongs to the street.
Esilarante
RED PILL WINS
went from “leaving the door open” to “changing the locks” he also went from “dripping in finesse” to “getting finessed”
Class!
i feel goosebumps whole song
This is too good to listen😭✋❤️ I'm in love
SilkSonicの皆様…いつも渾身の力を心を込めて歌を歌い音楽を心を込めて演奏してくださいましてありがとうございます。とても嬉しいです。
yo im a metal head and this has got me grooving in the hallways of my workplace like im in a movie, this song is the best
Boy came back from the dead like "Fast as funky boii" when his verse came on
Can we appreciate how long this Foo laid dead on the floor and came back to life 🤣🤣🤣
When they stomped I damn near had an aneurysm shit was to cold🥶🥶✋🏾
Some smooth moves right there,woo
Super cool music
1:36-1:50
This video reminded me how great Bruno Mars is. I also love his collaborators. Top notch
Bruno❤️

When Bruno Mars is grooving like this, I always get the feeling he might spin around and do a moonwalk just like Michael Jackson. 🕴🏼
Why does Bruno get to upload this lmao
The staying on the floor then popping back up like that 😂😂😂
<3
See MJ style in evry mooving..
Everyday person died from smoking 🚬 🚭

Anyone else notice how crazy those backdrop curtains were at 2:43?!
This song will hit a billion views, mark my words.

"This Bitch----******
Anderson Paak's personality dripping throughout the video. You have one new supporter.
This song applies to about ehh… 99.9% of women nowadays🤷‍♂️
AY BRUNO U WERE MY AUNTIES PROM DATE AND MY DAD WOULD GIVE U THE STINK EYE
THE DRUMS ARE REALLY GOOD IN THIS SONG.
Anderson .Paak givin me Bobby Womack vibes. Givin me soul train vibes. Yesssss 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 where my steppers at?
I FUCKING LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SHIT. NOW I NEED A BITCH TO PAY RENT FOR.
Ditch the smokes!
Why Bruno Mars new look, music and era is so iconic and feels so classical
If this doesn’t with a Grammy then idk what should
Back to the 80's
When Anderson said “this BITCH got me payin my rent” I felt that
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💯
Syota ng Bayan - Grin Department
THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A HOMICIDE!
Como dejar de fumar, solo prendan uno y canten..
It just gets better every time I listen!
From catching a grenade to this
Yall made bruno and anderson mad, dey finna close da door 😭
Bruno Mars & Anderson Paak is a incredible collaboration......... It's like Thanos with the infinity gauntlet and finally getting all 6 infinity stones. #Inevitable #Unstoppable
I’ll just let like sonic talk for me when I’m mad . Finally a song for the fellas

The winter is coming
Dios mencantaaaaa
노래는 좋은데 찌든 담배냄새가 느껴지네요ㅋㅋㅋ
What a fucking stupid song. Tone deaf AF.
🥰
Bruno Mars... I'm totally in love with you... With your new songs you were able to bridge the generation gap... I love the vibes... It's hip, it's cool, it  has the sound of oldies yet very refreshing to listen... You're amazing...
Every time I hear this song, Bruno coming in for second verse just gets me. He says "this BITCH" with a capital B. Any gif of that entrance doesn't even need subtitles, you can *see* him drop bitch with the crucial sound.

I’ve been waiting for silk sonic for the last 20 years. FINALLY QUALITY pop music with soul. I hope this starts a movement for better radio tracks. Well played Bruno / Anderson
Damn... This shits iconic
So they basically made a whole song 🎵  for "She belongs to the Streets" and it's catchy
Sounds like "Dick in a Box"
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍
Que música linda!
Simply beautiful vocalist true legends
I have feeling a good 30-40% of women liking this have no idea what they singing about
At last some dudes making caricatures and fun of themselves. refreshing
We need a Bruno Mars and Keemy Cassanova (Akeem Ali) Album. ASAP 💿 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Por favor bruno mars, faça uma música ruim para eu poder te criticar pelo menos uma vez na vida!
Im honestly obsessed with this song because I can relate. It sucks to know someone you were in love with didn't love you back. 😢😞 5 years wasted and 8 years of friendship down the drain ..I pray one day I can fully heal🙏😭

Anderson's peak sound like old school Bobby Brown🔥

Cause she belongs to the streets.................
This has no business being this funny 😂 Idek who it’s about but she got SOME NERVE 😂

Paak is bringing back acoustic drums.
Reminds me of stylistics

Check out the back- up crew.those guys are so smoooooth and in sync its nice to see them perform . I got to watch the video again and again, and again......
Bruno is just so amazing
It was the pop up for me 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nope not a fan anymore
This song will never be the same after I watched a different version by kosmic8🤣
Incrivel a  qualidade desses caras !!!    A muito tempo não  vejo  algo  tão excepcional  como  esse grupo .  Qualidade alem das expectativas   .   Um oasis nesse  momento  ruim  da  musica internacional/nacional.  Os caras  se superam . SHOW , SHOW , SHOW !!!
Music for the Apocalypse
Cool song, cool suits, cool video, terrible UK police shoes... good for crushing beetles tho!
So cool
This song has a high chance of becoming a JJBA Ending.
This song makes me feel like i was rich and buying everything for a girl😭
Check out my cover, hope you guys love it😁
cancer de pulmon jejeje XD
He is the music industry he is the artist of the century ❤️❤️❤️
This song is hilarious
One of the most eloquent ways to say she belongs to the streets
❤️‍🔥
Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh  Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

On the loop 🔥🔥🔥
We just do thing's better ✊🏽
SILK SONIC BEST MUSIC VIDEO EVER
This is a chill vibe.✅🔊
Every boys find a girl in the bar 🍻😂
this tune is ice cold
What I always want to do with my homies on a stage
THIS BITCH GOT ME PAYIN HER RENT! This is the iconic line from them...
When you combine the old soul/ R&B sounds today, it becomes a timeless piece of art for all generations to enjoy. This is the perfect example.
David ruffin and Eddie out here killing it again
1:19 best part
🗣"Must've spent 35 45 thousand up in tiffannnnnnyyyysss OOOOHHH NNNOOO!!!"
I thought bruno mars was old
Grade A music☝☝☝
That's what you get for keeping that damn door open. lmao
This is the smoothest way I've ever heard someone say she belongs to the streets
Te amoooo
This is the male version of sliding down the wall😅😅😅😅
Developed a crush for every man on that stage
Claaaaaaasiii
What a vibe of this song ... amazing 👍👍
Hiii axel here , listening from echo park , eating some junk . But lifes good . I'm so cold !!thinking about her
Dont nobody want to say it but Bruno is a goat...who disagrees...if you do yu a hater...
What a song! I've gotta learn those moves.
Lawd I tell you! This sunk into my bone marrow like I needed to resuscitated from the DUMB DOWN of today's music. And Anderson died and revived on beat like WHOA!
Paak has one of the most satisfying singing voices bro, I swear
Its good to be alive in 2021 for realz!!! just having the most fun. blessseddddd
Damn
This and “Leave The Door Open” are easily my two favorite singles of 2021
Bruhhh, I’m freaking the fuck out rn. i’ve had this song on repeat since the album dropped, and the whole time I keep picturing a video of old school r&b hand gestures/dancing, and now seeing the video for the first time I’m actually geeking, hella trippy! 🕺🏻
I'm following Anderson .Paak from now
Travis Scott be like 1:43
Anyone else see Bruno hit that ghost 2:38
I love this!
I love everything about this video and song 🤣 the song alone made me laugh but the video is just great 🤣
My mom likes your song for some reason, the only song I like that you own is... TALKING TO THE MOON
Aye this song makes my day I 💀 every trip🤣
What a pleasant and artistic way to call a hoe a hoe
😂😂😍🎭
why aren't there more views on this shit?
A trifling preference will drag yo ass 😆
This man drippin in swagoo
She belongs to the streets
I discovered Anderson .Paak through Eminem, and I love it
Marrrige a scam ,ha
You can't Xi me
Always😍😍
Reminded me so much about Hoodville. If you know you know 😉
This is probably the best collaboration in music
Bruno giving me Micheal Jackson’s vibes  😎
Hot take, carl wheezers cover was better

Woww this is fireeeee
Bruno went from jumping in front of trains to pushing people in front of trains
Damn. Dope song. Great lyrics.
Watching this again for the 20th time now. I'm a 70-year-old white woman who loves this song and video. Is that wrong?
He spit on that mic omm 😂
Imagine being told by Bruno Mars that you belong to the streets-
Bruno Mars is the best soulful singer out there. He is so soulful and funky at the same time. I would definitely go to one of his concerts.
The official SIMP song
Idgaf what anyone says, the way Bruno sang that chorus, he felt that shit.
This song so amazing
My fav part "this bitch get me paying her rent"
gotta play again
The drummers is to damn fit to be Bruno's older bro..
The part right before starts singing, it almost feels like you get hit into the song
Anderson + Bruno = Funk Soul Magic
Bringing back some FUNKY SOUL baby! Lets go!
Anderson Paak is the new coming of Curtis Mayfield
COLABORACION URGENTE CON BTS!!!!!!!!! SERIA UNA BOMBA APARTE QUE BAILAN BRUNO Y LOS CHICOS DE MARAVILLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best song so far😀😅 (dancing my ass off)
Awesome song!!!!!! but honestly if some words would have been replaced with the Streets, oh my that would have been insane
The way Anderson. Paak dropped and never let go of the cigarette priceless
Awesome
need this in fortnite last week stat
The duo we never knew we needed !
Does this song have a back story, because this is unbelievable lol
please ask Bruno's accessory to answer in my private, if there is this private chat page with Bruno or is it fake?
This is my muh fuggin jam!!! Vid had me dyinnn 🤣🤣🤣
This song is fucking great
1:44 Anderson: Someone's child  Bruno: The Oompa Loompas
Got me smoking out the window, subsonic flow and go!
This song and video is HI-LARIOUS!! 😂🤣😂🤣
The choreography 😍 so smooth
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Said that shit with a capital B
The fact that Bruno Mars didn't write a bust song
Bruno Mars was EXACTLY the Artist needed to match up with Anderson Paak and bring great music back at a mass level.
*SMOKING A BACKWOOD* THE YEAR IS 2060 AYE AYE AYE DJ PLAY THAT OLD SKOOL SILK REAL QUICK
This song slaps! From the intro by Boosty Collins ( it's Bootsy babeh! ) to the glorious melody and vocal work brings back the days of golden age motown with a modern twist. I hope Bruno and Bootsy do more collaborations in the future.
One of the best songs of all tome
I fucking love Bruno
and for this I am sure, a FORSUREYOURIGHTON
A Hit✨ no doubt I’m obsessed
Makes me laugh this song
Using good style of music to promote Tiffany&Co, Mercedez Benz... and smoking? Smoking though? Ugh.  I don't hate the music, but damn please don't promote smoking. It is gross.
soooooo much pantastic..ya hoooooo!!
Genius No 🧢
0:32 reminded me to pay rent
O mais incrível é que ele nunca erra 🥰🥺❤️👏🏻 m a r a v i l h o s o
I’d like to interpret Anderson falling on the ground while Bruno continues on repeating the chorus as the same bitch moving on from one man to the other sucking their souls and bank accounts dry lol
Amazing
😃😃😃😃 😃😃 How does Kane Brown and Khalid manage to stay in music business?  They both can't sing and they should get fired.    There's no future for singers like Kane Brown and Khalid.  They both are a disgrace to real country singers like Walker Hayes, Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton, Luke Combs, Keith Urban, Dan&Shay, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.  Kane Brown sounds like a street singer begging for spare change in the street.  That's why he can't carry anything on his own, he has to be part of a collaboration...I'm actually surprised anyone wants to work with him at all!  If truth be told, I'd bet Chris Young and Blackbear both were forced to do so.  No Kane Brown at CMA awards please.  He's gonna ruin the show again just like 3 years ago. He's nothing but a loser who is terribly overrated..
There's no doubt that Bruno is a great singer.
A Collab with NEW EDITION would be OFF THE CHARTS and OUT of THIS WORLD  !
Amooooo!😍😍😍😍
More More now that was lit!
I didn’t think this could’ve gotten but I just saw the live and they delivered
sentava em todos
I saw her with the iiisland boyyys
I saw her
I saw her
LMAOO Bruno must have gone through this with a chick.  The way he's like THIS BIHHH! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  He's going IN! 🤭🤭🤭
Since when bruno smoke
Musta spent 35, $45 dollars on some chicken wingsssssss!
Just me, here again for my daily dose of this song.
This is the best music video since Thriller.    The music is the BEST i have heard in a long time
guys , Bruno & Anderson are sexy beings creating sexy music .
"I hope you're walking barefoot through these streets" is such a specific insult
notice how there is not a single dislike
😍This 1970s Soul Music reincarnated in millennial bodies  Paak looking like Bobby Womack/David Ruffin😀😀😃👍👍
It' the '...barefoot in these streets.' for me lolol
loved paak, did not care about bruno, huge fan of both now. a collab of epic proportions.
Bruno so damn cool and smooth😎 he will forever be one of my celebrity crushes for that fact
Is That Bruno Mars on the drums?
Lol everybody is making throwback music now
Soty de canción
World Tour. NOW!!!
thank you so much, bruno. this song and video fills my heart up inside. and the way you mix the music with the comedy and the awesome dance moves and Anderson p.a.a.k....words can’t describe this. this will be a masterpiece in the coming years.
This Song is pretty good
Parfait le show
this shit was funny
That song hard than a MF!
CHRISTMAS LOVE SONG = 2021 ** Christmas is coming and I'm all alone With no one to snuggle at night. My wineglass is empty to help dull desire To kiss you by soft candlelight.  A rare pearl of value, you don't leave alone Or someone will steal them from you. After they've gone and flown far away It's hard to know just what to do.  I'm watching my neighbors hang lights on their tree With tinsel and striped candy cane. I took you for granted and didn't hug enough And now I must suffer my pain.  Lord, I'm so lonely; I wish I could die Then be born to relive again. I realize the value of someone to love And the danger of my selfish sin.  There's a ring on my phone and a knock at the door Which do I dare go for? If neither is you, I'll break down and cry And again pound my fist on the floor.  I run down the hall and the doorknob turns As the swirling snow rides on the wind. There, in my doorway, it's the face I love Such a beautiful present to send.  Now, I am happy and dancing around With a permanent smile on my face. As children are singing their Christmas love songs And the world is a wonderful place.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

This video is hilarious.  Bruno look like he's actually pissed at someone and Paak sneaking in out of no where?
🌟 Certified BOP 🌟
So they can come up with 70s sound
Can't wait for Charles Cornell's analysis video for this song.  "Skate" and "Leave the Door Open" are both killer, but this one is my favorite so far!
Bruno is female right? She has beautiful cheek bones
When two icons unite to make nothin...but magic.... 🙌💕💯
I got this song as an ad and boy am I glad I did.
🧈
Bruno Mars tomou a Red Pill
This is like the greatest music combo since like the Jackson 5
Paak at 1:44 is me every time the beat comes after "Dis Bitch!"
THIS BITCH! GOT ME
te amo :)
my man disconnected so hard mid match LOL
This is a more polite version of "She is for the streets."
This was all I needed 🤣❤️🙌🏻💃🕺

Love so much for tanzania 🇹🇿🇹🇿
Just have to love Bruno Mars
1:44  Me pretending to drown to see if anyone cared if I died:

I need them to be an official group!!!! Since i heard leave the door open, i've been hooked
The "she belongs to the streets" anthem.
Am I the only one who cries to this song lol
Yo this is the joint. Too smooth. Love it
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here  Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh  Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me  But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (that girl there, she belong to everybody), ooh  Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass Is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out!

apasih keren bgt criiii T.T
"Got her kids running round my house like its Chuck e 🧀 lol
Love love love and more love ❤❤❤ this song is the best ballad out right now
Let's be real, you searched for this.   Welcome to the pile bro, forget about her.
Bruno looks like that one you don’t come up short too🔪👨‍🦯🎩
Бруно прекрасен
Mais uma pra ficar viciada kkkkkk, Bruno arrasa, dupla perfeita!!🎵❤️
Обожаю. Сто раз пересмотрела
A tour would be niceeeee
Woahhh, did'nt expect this 😶
Que melodia fantástica BRASIL😇
Sheeeeeeesshh
Great tune but misogynistic lyrics much?
Them : i thought she belonged to only me, but i was wrong, she belongs ...." Me : THE STREET Them : to everybody
This song sums up how you gotta react to being cheated on. You're justified in feeling sad, and betrayed and like you wanna die. But then you accept that the girl belongs to the city, to the streets, to everybody but you, and drop her.
The dynamic duo!!
People always say "Bruno's voice is so good" but can we PLEASE just appreciate the sheer talent Anderson .Paak has? Dude is so criminally underrated. Even now.
When you focus on yourself you can move from being Bruno Mars in Grenade to this..
I'ma leave the door open....... To this BITCH 🤣
On my mama this lit 🔥
It represents well the self-interested women of today. It's blow after blow. That's why the rule is clear: send the drops of pleasure and get out.
On Repeat!
It sounded sweet when he said "I hope you find what you need" Then he got his guns out😂😂😂
You got a new friend love y’all
Went from "I'ma leave the door open" to"THIS BITCH GOT ME.."🤣😂
This Bi#$&× got me paying her rent 😭😩🤣
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through these hard times, thank god for music! I love you  💖💖
1:15 this moment of cinematography with the camera bounce made me jump off my seat like, “OH FUCK YEAH”
Esto si es música ,wow

Extraordinary pure chemistry it be no other group after them.that will have this effect on the music industry  Genius!! Silk Sonic keep the magic going!!

Bruno Mars is the best

Considering how crap Bruno's music was in like 2010-11 this is actually really good! I kinda like him now haha

Mampir donk
idk how it took so long for these two to get together and make a song. But DAMN, they sound so good together!
How could anyone not like this song
Anderson .Paak was so underrated before
So happy there is someone out there looking out for good music.
Bruh...just break up
Is this a parody
Bruno Mars is the best singing r&b singer of the new generation pure talent it’s not even close
This song is a banger
Love this!!!! This biotech 😂 lol I never had my kids running around!! Thank you for the Tiffany’s tho lol 😂 jk
Just the other night she was grippin on me tight screaming Hercules
Harika bir müzik
Kupikir milikku ternyata milik semuah orang 🚬😀💃
Love this!!! Anderson playing dead and then coming back to life for his next verse 🤣🤣🤣 priceless. Can’t wait to see them in concert ❤️
She belongs to the street.
Actual singing:  ✅  Actual musicianship with REAL instruments: ✅ Actual nostalgic rhythm: ✅ Equals the best modern interpretation of what we once knew real music as in the last 30 years. Excellent.
Aye burno is back
Bruno is slaying in the suit 🙇‍♀️
Cool song
what a perfect way to say fuck you
Totally addicted!!!
Crimson Capsule. Like The Weekend
Курить это очень плохо, а рекламировать сигареты это вообще зло!
PURE COMEDY!!! I swear this song is hilarious and musically genius all at once
This was a youtube ad and I SWEAR it was a commercial, then Anderson. Paak burst in the scene "THIS...BITCH..." 🤣
The Anderson came in the frame "this bitch got me..." I'm weak 🤣🤣🤣
Only came here bc of the videos I’ve been seeing and I’m glad I did this is 🔥🔥
Looks like Quentin Tarantino won't have to find an old Delfonics tune for his next movie………
Sucks that happened
노래도 좋고, 무대도 좋은데..담배들고 입에도 대면 한국티비엔 못 나와요.
This can go one of two ways: "she" can be about a woman or drugs
Silk Sonic FUCKS
Why does this feel like Bruno Mars' music never gets bad? Always gold.
This is an addiction
Redpill pura, acorda rapaziada 🥃
I love that they switch up who sings the hook. they did that on the first song they released too and its perfect
My Fav ❤
And at the end of the day ... she belongs to the streets. lol
The Hercules Part is one of the most satisfying to watch
Listen now: https://youtu.be/U-tpWHjJGYg
Conglaturations！👑 💗
https://youtu.be/5FmtxZZ8ot0
Bravo France
The funniest thing about this song: the women i know thinking it is "empowering". LOL. You don't get it.
I'm listening to this song so much that I'm almost starting to smoke  just to feel the vibe better.
The cigarettes are the real MVP here.
Silk Sonic is the real deal and I’m here for it. I will be cooking Thanksgiving dinner, two stepping🎉🍾
This my shit already 🕺🏽🤣 this bitch that’s when I felt ts🤣
SO IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS MAN JUST DIED 1:44😭😭
Brunos said it with his chest! "diiz bitCHHH!" 🤣
1:35 the best part 😭😭😭
LOVE THIS❤❤❤
There is truth in this song. Single mothers are the doom of a man who messes with them.
🔥🔥🔥
Bruno Mars is channeling some real Sammy Davis jr vibes, awesome
What a god awful song!!
okay but he actually playing dead made me laugh 😹
This song will still be a hit even 50 years later 😁😁😁
"Dis BTCH" LOL
노래 부르며 들고 있는 담배+ 떨어지는 담뱃재가 거슬리는 당신은 한국인 ㅋ
sayang yosi puro tapon
Is this what happened after they leave the door open?
Did you have to call her a bitch! A female Dog. Sorry, but my Mom didn't  have no Puppies!
Such a great song! 👍
superrrrrr lit
How can people dislike this damn
‎
this def got some temptations vibes but i feel this is better! i also feel this group thing in this video is a one time thing! keep that shit going! Bring the groups back!
Bruno and paak just hits different together 🔥🔥🔥
This is classic
What a ciggaretes bro ?

This song is for the simpin man 😂

These two sound so good! I have been i fan of Bruno for a while but wow
Let’s be real that Hercules part was smooth as yk what 🔥🔥

Sexual Chocalates!👏🏽

Masterpiece
0:32 I have a feeling that this will become a meme
let's win it !
Bruh, I wanna know who the bxtch is that hurt my boy Bruno.😂😂😂😂😂He said bxtch in all capital letters.
Top 10 greatest record of all time!!! Dont debate me
Smooth as always 😩
😎😎😎😎
love this
Smells like success 🚬
Bro used to sing about how he'd jump on a grenade for a woman. Seems like he's fed up 🤔
During that whole versus faze I would’ve loved to see Bruno mars go against someone I don’t know who maybe Chris brown or some, what I like about those versus videos is both artists gave each other the respect they deserve and earned.
Anderson paak laying at the floor cause he to damn good at signing hahahahaha
How did Bruno hit that high note soon after hitting that smoke?
Best Shit Ever!
Paak got strong Dave Chappelle vibe.
wow!! They are really good. Love it! I've seen good good women and bad women. Great song.
Awesome, hilarious,  very smart!
Bruno Mars went from I think I want to marry you to Smokin out the window! Wow lol
Waouh magnifique lol
why no one giving my boy anderson .Paak some more love, this aint jus bruno mars song
Men theme song
When my boy Paak pops up off the floor 😭😭😭
This bish…😆
Anderson paak is better then Bruno Mars
From Treasure To This 😂😂 I’m Not Complaining Tho
I die laughing because Anderson is just dead on the floor & just popping in front of the camera out of nowhere. Such a great song!
I love that the Hooligans are part of Silk Sonic; can't beat loyalty which is rare these days! Bruno a real one for that.
WAO, how much did you grow Bruno, and just watch your video as a child singing, and look at you now :3, LIKE by bruno, and let's enjoy this song. :D
Lyrics: Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Must've spent 35, 45 thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it), I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am, all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mhmm) But I was wrong, 'cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" ("Hercules, Hercules") Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone, help me, please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold, you got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (that girl there, she belong to everybody), ooh Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass Is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out! Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (ooh, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody (yes, she belong to everybody) Everybody (yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody), ooh

You don't understand how many time I click the replay button
Why the left backup singer look like Gucci Mane?? 😂
OMG, Silk Sonic is one of the best things that happened amidst these dark pandemic times. Thank you Anderson and Bruno for bringing moments of joy and peace to our lives. They soothe my soul like no one else. Your art will not be forgotten over time.
man, this is truly one of the greatest music videos i've ever seen - I mean that.... the genuine humour, and pure talent of these two shining thru is just amazing - I lost it at the bit when anderson .paak sings "smoking out the window" fast at about 0:48 secs in haha what an amazing tune (move aside, ceelo - there's a new best heartbreak song in town)
Chuck cheese and the lean is what did it for me🥰
80´ the music

Tyler should remix this
Already down in the hall of Fame
Smooth as Silk.
This track's one's gonna be remembered for a very, very long time indeed because of how good it is. Not too often do you get a stone cold jam to listen to, but they make you laugh, too. Geniuses of their craft, this is art.

This is an amazing song foreal

Bruno Mars really is a generational talent. Truly extraordinary!
Bruno might be the GOAT
Kind of hard to believe this came out in 2021 😂

Future approved this song 🤣🤣🤣🤣
WTF, did you hear the lyrics?? So sexist... you dont have to take the mindset of the past, just the rhythm

WHO THINKS THIS TYPE OF MUSIC SHOULD COME BACK
Vibe
IM DEFINITELY IN LOVE WITH THE MUSIC  WITH THE PROGRESSION OF THE WORLD YOU NEED BETTER VIDEOS....
Who got a number for the mans back left 👀😍
These new Bruno songs are hilarious as well as actual bonafide bops
My favorite song now
Anderson .Paak  does not miss.
If I was Bruno, they'd probably had a hundred takes to film the second pre-chorus where Paak was playing dead on the ground multiple times because I would end up cackling each time.
Stop calling women bitches. I've had it. So disrespectful.
🔥❣️🔥
He went to catch a grenade to throw one at you
this bitch got me paying her rent
Lo amo 😻
Why do I feel like Aint Shit by Doja Cat and this song would go well together story wise LOL
great song
This is the man's point of view of Erykahs Badu Call Tyrone retro 2021.
Looks like Bruno on the drums
SILK SONIC YOU. HAVE. DONE. IT. AGAIN. ANOTHER AMAZING SONGN AS USUAL.

Loving Bruno groove 🤘
The way he popped back up on the camera😂
He played dead 🤣🤣
💞Oh gentlemen those moves, have moved me. Thanx very much 🎶😍😍😍😍🎶💞
sounds like every bruno mars song
🤣😂😂😂😂 she for the streets yall
Bruno is a phenom by himself, and Anderson is a beast by himself, but them together...POWERHOUSE!!! You should do a concert with just you two. Your songs, his songs, and Silk Sonic songs. Maybe even an intimate mini show of Silk Sonic playing all of your songs live...This would be Epic. ❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
best ever music video!
1:32
Sugar daddy anthem🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What is better than this? Ntn but love for y'all 🥰
"Welcome back music, where you been?"
paak on the floor always gets me
Awesome
Wow bruno annan uyr
What is Lebron James doing over there ??
Finally, some good pop music.  No generic mumble rap, stupid bro country or auto tuned pop tarts.
1:37 That cigarette in the finger thooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Quem são esse meninos que cantam com ele? Conheço poucas músicas do Bruno mas quando canta com os meninos fica muito bacana.
who reads this, be happy and healthy)))
"I also hope that your trifling is walking round barefoot in these streets.." hahahahahaha
1:44…… 💀😂😆😂😆😂😆😆😆😂😆 i love this so much, my chest hurts
How do they keep coming up with treasures like these?
not to be dramatic but i want to die. proceeds to melt down smoothly
I'm  really digging this stuff!
哈根菸94爽
You know it’s good music when Bruno Mars is on it. 😎
Props to Anderson Paak
Anderson. when he got back up that was hahahahahahaahahahahahahahahah
Bruno Mars  you  sing leave the  door and   i love  but I was wrongggggg
She dont belong to the streets, she belong to THE WHOLE CITY
Went from "Catch a grenade for you" to "throw a grenade at you hoe"
This is just so good I'm addicted
To all the narcissist and all feminist women listen to these lyrics this is jamming for you. This is a message for you
Silk Sonik❣️✨
I love you 😘❤️💕 and everyone else lol xoxoxoxox   I would love to smoke with you and talk about our family history.  Queen Sheba 👑👸  I love walking around barefoot 🦶 no blood diamonds 💎 needed.   I am surrounded by love and unmeasurable pressure, no needs for the symbolism of a piece of cole.   It’s all naughty children find in their stockings anyway. I guess I’m okay, with finding cole in my Christmas stockings this year. I’ve been a bad girl. 😘😜😉
Bruno Back!!  Why you mad; fix your face! ❤️❤️
AHHH ANDERSON VIOLATED
This is the best Silk Sonic song so far!!! I LOVE IT! They're looking as sharp as ever
Sounds like Bruno Mars has got some red pills and studies MGTOW
ama
Anderson Paak's cigarette flick at 0:32... ICONIC. This video is the cat's pajamas.
They should have sung “She bellngs to the streets” ffs
This reminds me of what my dad used to listen to in the 70’s. 😎 Love it!
久保田の弟？
damn that's smooth
Why am I so entranced with this
the way he s holding the cigarette... mans really in disbelief😭
EXELENTE⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
had to 🥺
The best song on that album💯
This video is full of meme material
So smooth. So aesthetic. So much vibe. I know there but words but they fit so well
I get new edition vibes from this
Women : this lyrics is so funny lol Mostly man : this lyrics can relate. Thats one thing FO SHO!!!
Sooooo this is a fancy way to say she belongs to the streets.... I like it ..... I LOVE IT 💕✨💖
masterpiece
This song got me smokin' out the window..🎶
Lmao don’t be a step-dad fellas
Redpill
These guys...make you laugh in the middle of a heartbreak song. Such a great duo! Sultry...will keep it on repeat!
Old School 🏫
Legendary song ❤️❤️
I have mixed feelings about this song. I hate cigarettes (or anything similar) VERY MUCH that it balanced out my emotions to a complete zero (simply put, apathetic).  I neither like nor dislike this video.
I laughed so hard when he popped back up😂
This is the sequel to Treasure and no one can change my mind.
Very smooth guys...❤️❤️❤️
My girlfriend: you're already living in my house, at least find a job Me: 0:32
Can we take a moment to acknowledge that Bruno Mars is a musical genius. This right here, was amazing.
When Bruno brings out a new song, you knows it’s going be a good song
Best actual singer in the the world😭❤️🎶🎶
❤️❤️❤️
NO ONE TALKS ABOUT HOW GOOD THE CHOREO IS??
I love the choreography
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Smoothest song of the decade !!! Cant wait to come back here in 15 years when this is a classic throwback!!!
Please bring this on vinyl! I need to be able to nurture my grand-children with this album when I'm old and dusty, saying to them music was better when I was young
I need this calm amidst the noise of the society.
Anderson paak is just awesome
Never disappointed us
My friends girl broke up with him the same day this song came out 💀
Dear.Mr.Bruno Mars san … You‘re  an Perfectly Singer and TOP Musician 💗♫🍎
Love this song new but old fashioned
I know a girl that jumps from man to man to man, who only dates them because she can’t pay her own mortgage or car payments.   She hates me because I called her out on it when she started dating a military guy who bought her another car and is fully paying her mortgage.  She complained to me about losing him because she doesn’t know how to pay her bills without him.  She didn’t like when I said sell her house and 2 sports cars and live within her means and find love, not a paycheck.
MASTERPIECEEEEE
Perfect song♥♥
Not me rewatching this for the 100th time ...im addicted
this song makes me wanna get banged by a dude named adrian @Stellxr
A song that is literally based off, "She belongs to the streets!"
This is real smooth.
https://youtu.be/Q6XCYfuFrsI
Love how they bring back the old school video production.
A masterpiece ❤
Not only did Natalie make him pay the rent, but she stole the Versace he left on the floor.
I purchased all their songs just because they blessed me with a video I didn’t know I needed!
One of the best songs and videos ever. If I was born in the 60s I would love to have did this song back then! My boy was laying on the ground! Hahahhahahhah
😂😂😂😂 l love it !!!!!! Oscar
this is so so good omfg
Ok...nice song...great tribute to 70s R&B...did we really need the "This...BITCH" part? Asses and whatever?
If they don't win a music award, the industry is a full of s
This group is the greatest... thats happening right now.
How come it feels like a steve smith song from American Dad
Una vaina épica
SMOOTH R AND B!!
Silk Sonic them boys nice! We desperately needed this soulfulness because it's like a lost art in music nowadays.
LOL! Guys but like when Anderson comes in on his "this bitch got me..." at 0:30 ! This song got me reminiscing about my nonexistent  trifling ex, cussing him TF out  This is a jam and then some. I'm happy they're getting recognized for their brilliance!
Feels like im in the 90's R&B.
Tax the RICH now
“UFC” WAS SO GOOD
Okay but can we talk about how Bruno went from "When I was your man" to "when I gave a damn"
DAMN THIS IS THE FUNNIEST SHIT EVER!!! THE FRAME WITH ANDERSON ON THE FLOOR AND THEN HE POPS UP BACK UP STANDIN LIKE AINT SHIT HAPPEND LOL FUNNY ASS MUTHAFUCKAS!! REAL TALENT! WOW LEGENDS
Okay now if music can go this route I’m hopeful for the future
🔥🔥🔥🔥
For some reason, I laugh when the "bitch" word coming
"This B**** got me paying her rent."
Welp. I'm back for the umpteenth time, to view this masterpiece. I can't tell you the last time I watched a video repeatedly. lol
If Future was funk instead of hip hop.   This is basically a classy way of saying “the streets are calling her”
I feel like this song was my grandpa back in the day.
Nice one.. He gone and did it again 😁💞
Anderson .Paak looks like Malcolm X. I’m just saying
This shii is a vibe when  Anderson was on the floor got me DEAD☠😭
redpill
Heavy S/O to Anderson Paak on the second verse.  My guy died and came back quicker than Jesus, aaaaand #ontime. GoodMukka💪🏾
Didn't know Bobby Womack was still alive🤔
BOTH AMAZING SINGER!!!
It's the "Now I gotta give you back! To the ciTYyY!" for me! 😂😂😂😂 Also, "But I also hope that your trifling ass is walking around barefoot in these streets." 😂😂😂😂
Obsessed with this song
Love it
Dis  Bitch Got me paying her rent
Simply amazing!!!
Love this song, a great collab, Anderson .Paak & Bruno has a solid album, definitely getting it. All about being used & abused by a single mom, wow.
I was not ready for him to just be laying on the floor lifeless like that 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bringing back that oldie music vibe is what this world needs. Tired of violence, sexist, empty lyrics music these days.
seems like Treasure music video 2.0
Jesus Christ is coming back soon repent forgive reject the flesh reject the devil in his demons receive God and his son while they're still time no one will escape God's judgment heaven or hell eternal life or eternal damnation the choice is yours God bless.
I miss the old Bruno But Brunos voice is mesmerizing as usual!!!
When a song sounds so good it don’t even feel like it fits the time period
Okay guys I can't stand this crap yo the 70s called Mr Bruno Mars they want their music back. Do better this sucks.
They have never missed 😩🔥
Went from catching grenades, to marry me, to THIS BITCH 🤣
Okay, no one can deny the brilliance of this performance.  Bruno Mars and Anderson. Paak with Silk Sonic, AMAZING!
Lmmaawo.  Love it.  Thx fellas we needed that one.  One for the men......
Bruno wenr from "Imma leave the door open" to " B*tch get the f*ck out"!
Anderson Paak’s “And here I am alone” is always my favorite part of this song just perfect
She belongs to the streets. That's what he should have said
Lmao this song is good, but it had me dying 😂😂 with the word's . Chucky cheese, this bitch, and then playing dead on the floor 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
45M views and not even one dislike ♥
Dear Bruno. (Voice of Peter griffin) Who hurt you , who hurt you .
wow I love this song!
Anderson had me in tears when he played dead
Stop simping men lol
Not sure if anyone said it but I really wish he would have said “She belongs to the streets.” 🤣🤣🤣
Me encanta su música y verlo bailar
I swear there group get better and better each time i live this group😍😜
Where do you start here ??!Incredible harmonies..smooth melody..haunting chorus..velvet attire..Temptations' dance  moves..Anderson laying on the floor..Bruno on his knees..It's one of the best performances I've seen or heard in decades..Kudos to all involved..and a heartfelt thank you..👏🎶🙌🎵❤
is this song the nicest way to tell a woman she belongs to the streets
Whoever inspired this song drives an 08 Altima with A.K.A. license plates with 2/3rds of the front headlight gone
DAMN so smooth
Good vibes 😍🥰
_"They don't make songs like they used to."_  *Songs:*
I just love me some him oh qui qui sexy Bruno
AMAZING <3
Love this jam
Lmao, these lyrics are so relatable to me. I used to be one of those guys and learned the hard way that beotches will use you. Now? I save that $$$ or it's 50/50. You might get a happy meal if you act right. Oh, great video, reminds me of the 70's
Those glasses made me think of David Ruffin
This is the national _simp_ anthem 😂🤣
1:35 the best lyrics ever
These some bad brothas but smoking gon ruin them nice voices. Ask Robin Thicke.
Redpill about single mathers.
What took so long for you two to find each other??? The vocals mixed + the humor is 👌🏽
Lyrics: Wait a minute, this love started off so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mh, mh, mh Must've spent thirty five Forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone), uh I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (mmh) But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, ooh Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How? How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (one thing's fasho) (One thing's fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belong to everybody) That girl there, she belong to everybody, ooh Look here, baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope That your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (hoo-ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (woo-hoo, ooh) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) To everybody, everybody (yeah, she belonged to everybody) (Yeah, yeah, she belonged to everybody) ooh
I'm a little late but the director and camera crew understood the assignment
Dear.Mr.BrunoMars…You Bring out the Best  in  me?
Bruno and team can make heart break  music videos that can actually let people groove in sadness 😂
Them 3 taps! And came back from dying! The city dont want her
When she belongs to the Streets...
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
Someone needs to do a remix of this and pressure by Ari Lennox please 😭💕
My mans was on the floor looking like a family guy character 😂
Bruno started off jumping on grenades and ended up like this.
Why does Brono Mars look like a new version of Sammie Davis Jr. to me?
I think this video should be released with a version with  cigarettes graphically obscured or erased for sanitization 😆
Greatness!!!
Great performance
Took a New Edition dance move.. But im very happy to hear  some new great R n B today. 😃
GROOVIEST TRACK OF THE YEAR❤️‍🔥
Love it!
El mejor
I hope u always sing together because this was more than amazing.
Bruno went from catching grenades for women to calling them Bitches. Damn 😂😂😂
This song feels like it belongs in a bee gees album
The Weeknd is missing from this track
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
this shit got me hooked
Se la dedico a Stray KIds
Hey ya"ll they were robbed !!! Ya hear me !they should  have won every award that AMAs were handing out !!!!! They earned it. They deserved it.
These boys just turned Bitch back into a slur
BRUNO I BELONG TOO YOU......2021
This song is a reminder fellas never simp
They clearly understood the assignment on this she for the streets instant classic
What a great song.
JIJIJAJA
Ah, a perfect mix I believe, letting the music be the star, while a touch of performance. Wow
Smoking Is Bad Ya know ?
can someone tell me the name of the suit they’re wearing
Sempre perfeitos 💜💜💜
Woaaa Don't miss another new one Here https://youtu.be/Tk_RrKwPoYU
Si pero Anderson en el piso me da 100mil años de vida ♡
Yes, I agree, the lyrics are awful, it's an attack on "women", "smoking" on video is definitely a No-No. Please change the Lyrics "Bruno & Andy", you can do better than this.
ok
As a producer and music listener I'm so happy the old soulful and analog sounds of the 70s are making a coming back.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bruno não erra nunca ❤️
holy shit this is groovy asf   hope they keep making collabs
Bravo!
“Chucky cheeseeee”
I was waiting  for Anderson to fall out last night on the AMAs
I need more.   I'm totally digging this album. I've purchased it too.   Was getting ready to have some naughty fun when my bf asked his speaker to play some sexy music. I swear this entire album played.
Someone needs to add a sax solo or a trumpet in there, like maybe six minutes of just instrumentals, like some James Brown.
man, i can't stop listening to this. every day, after work. so good.
Bonkers and brilliant at the same time.
Singers smoking cigarettes?  Aren’t they worried about their throats and lungs?  Not to mention, bad example for fans who watch this.  It’s a bummer because the music is next level.
How does this great gentleman keep making music like this? And keeps getting better every year.
Bruno Mars is one of those artists who can't make a bad song, even if he tried
Smokin and remiscin those efin days wasted just for a girl.. Always sayin how could you this to me - these lines bro. Tnx pak and Bm
Bruno isn’t catching grenades no more😭
When you burn bridges you end up alone in the end.
Sempre gostei do bruno amo muito

I sometimes forget Bruno Mars exists and then a banger just comes out of nowhere. I’m feeling the vibes of this song

Clipe bem feito, mas o melhor é a letra da música kkkkkkk
Phenomenal....I'm going to pay for this album. This is worth my ££££s. This is premium!
Messed up the song with calling a woman a bitch, wasn't necessary

Homem da minha vida mds 🥰🥰🥰
These men are national treasures
This is the smoothest she belongs to the streets ever
this is gonna be a classic
Meu Deus! 😱Esta música realmente expressa a realidade atual sobre as mulheres modernas! 😄  Eu apostaria que, os Dislikes neste vídeo são de mulheres que se acham "a melhor bolacha do pacote", que não têm vergonha de serem promíscuas, não têm vergonha de serem superficiais, não têm vergonha de serem sanguessugas sociais, não têm vergonha de usar os homens pelos seus recursos resultantes do seu trabalho, depois trocam de homem como quem troca de cueca/calcinha, e ainda têm o descaramento de dizer que, num homem, a «beleza interior é o que conta» e não o dinheiro nem a aparência dele.😏  - Ah, pois é, bebé... «M'ingana qu'eu gostu!» ... 😆🤣
OMGoodness! 😱This song really expresses nowadays'reality about modern women!😄 I would bet that, the Dislikes on this video are from self-entitled women who have no shame on being promiscuous, no shame on being shallow, no shame on being social leeches, no shame on using men for their hardworked resources, and then they have no shame on stating that, the «inner beauty is what it counts» not money nor looks, on a man.😏 Yeah, right!...😆🤣
Who could possibly e against this song? What is incorrect or untrue in the lyrics? Right...nothing!
"Just the other night she was gripping on me tight screaming Hercules"  ...officially dead, no words...
ANDERSON .PAAK!!!!!
ฉันชอบเพลงคุณมากคะ
BRASIL 🇧🇷
Natalie strikes again...
Paak falling out was perfect!😂😂😂
El Show de las Estrellas ha mejorado mucho, grande Jorge Barón

He died...then just popped back up to "smoke out da window" some more... 😆 🤣 😂
"This Bitch." lives in my head rent free
Good. Very good. From Japan

The Temptations has entered the chat
Definitely another work of art💯💯. It's the words for me. 😂😂😂😂 I can relate so well, it ain't even funny.
Dear radio.....we are all not 17-year-old dread heads who listen to mumble rap. this is the music that we need. sincerely, a grown ass man
She belongs to the streets
Não acredito! Uma música RedPill em 2021?? O que? :o Será que ainda há esperança? Ouvir isso após aquela biba do Tiago Iorc dá um alívio :)  Is the Winter still comes or not we are cool? xD
maybe the songs fetty wap or any other songs that were made today were good, just for us to bottle up all our ears to finally listen to a good piece such as this one and be more surprised and amazed by it...
Why is this soooo goood lmao it’s like funny but this song is 🔥
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!
Aoooo disgramada!!!

Andy on the floor and then Bruno bringing it home at the end did it for me!!!!
ITS NOT A GAME PEOPLE, YOU COULD DIE TOMORROW, QUIT PLAYING AROUND, THESE ARE END TIMES!!! TURN TO JESUS NOW!  hell is the absence of God Almighty who gives us the breath in our lungs, water, food, sunshine, love, kindness, patience, faithfulness, hope, rest, help etc. hell is real and its a place of torment: you will have to live with all your mistakes, regrets, you will feel all the pain you caused others...  you be hungry but not be able to eat you will be thirsty but wont be able to drink you will be tired but cant sleep you will have no hope you will have no rest you will feel pure hatred towards you (satan and the fallen angels/demons hate you and want to drag you to hell)  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” -Romans 6:23  Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." -John 14:6  "But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven." -Matthew 10:33 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stop worshiping and idolizing celebrities, influencers, musicians, actors, athletes, politicians, etc.    ONLY GOD ALMIGHTY IS WORTHY OF PRAISE, HONOR, GLORY & THANKSGIVING.    STOP PUTTING YOUR HOPE IN THE GOVERNMENT, IN YOUR PASTOR, IN RELIGION, IN SCIENCE, IN WEALTH, IN CELEBS, IN SPORTS, IN THE WORLD (IT WILL PERISH!)  ITS NOT A GAME PEOPLE, YOU COULD DIE TOMORROW, QUIT PLAYING AROUND, THESE ARE END TIMES!!!  These people work for satan and are trying to distract you from turning to God.  They have sold their soul's to the devil, who hates God's creation and wants to destroy it.  satan wants to drag you to hell with him.    Only Jesus Christ (God Almighty, who died for your sins), is worthy of praise, worship, honor and glory.  Im not talking about religion, Im talking about starting a relationship with the Creator of all.  Cry out to Him before it's too late.  Ask Him into your life and to forgive your sins.   “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” -Romans 6:23  Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." -John 14:6  "But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven." -Matthew 10:33
Say she belongs to the streets without saying she belongs to the streets.
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die"  Most legendary lyrics of all time
🔥🔥🔥🥰🤩
Great !!!
Bruno Mars the only one who knows how to sing without the "autotune" microphone and other technical devices. One of the only ones to have real talent. One of the few to renew itself, the only one who understands that rap, clown clothes and jewelry, crazy and obscene music videos are over. Now to be a star you have to have a real voice, you have to be a musician. 2021 is a milestone date for the end of rap and impostors. It's a prediction. With record views close to 100 million the puplic is not mistaken.
Bruno from Hawaii has done his job very well so far. why do people compare him to Jackson??? He has proven his value in his own way.
i could believe Flight Of the Concrds wrote this ;)
Wait a minute this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me Smokin out the window  0:09 Must have spent 35, $45,000 up in Tiffany’s (oh no) Got her bad ass kids runnin round my whole crib like it’s Chuck E Cheese (whoa, whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can’t believe it (can’t believe it) I’m in disbelief  0:29 This bitch got me payin her rent, payin for trips, diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists And here I am all alone (all alone) I’m so cold, I’m so cold, you got me out here  0:43 Smokin out the window (smoking out the window) Singing how could she do this to me (how could she do this to me) Oh I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong Cuz she belong to everybody, everybody   1:14 Just the other night she was grippin on me tight Screamin Hercules (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club looking for a new love someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby why you doin this, why you doin this to me, girl Not to be dramatic but I wanna die  1:34 This bitch got me paying her rent, paying for trips, diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists And here I am all alone. (All alone) I’m so cold, I’m so cold. You got me out here  1:47 Smokin out the window (Smokin out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin how could she do this to me (how could she do this) Oh I thought that girl belonged to only me (one things fo sho, one things for sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody, that girl yes she belong to everybody)   2:18 Oh no Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your trifling ass is walking round barefoot in these streets, lookout  2:28 Girl it breaks my heart that you ain’t right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) to the city Oh, you got me  2:41 Smokin out the window Singing how could she do this to me (How could she do this baby?) Oh I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) Cause she belong to everybody (she belong to everybody) She belong to everybody
“DIS BITCH GOT ME PAYIN HER RENT”
So fucking smooth
I just typed “bitch” then this song came up
I don‘t get over this choreography. The best song and dance I ve seen in years
Hearing Bruno Mars say, "This bitch" sounds so wrong in such a good way.
It is that new but classic video vibe. #Fresh
1:36

Hope Bruno Mars notice Woozi. TT
O melhor é que o Anderson continuou no chão  kkkkkkkk
Album of the year! Song of the year! Best Duo or group! Grammy SWEEP
The secret ingredient to making a classic R&B Song= being a simp
Vocals and choreography...smooth
Can the chunky brothers in the back get some love making them smooth as Bruno
Love this song, but I feel like they missed an opportunity to say, "...she belo-o-ongs to the streets,  and everybody..." 😂
my man took that "but I wanna die" seriously
são os patrões porra
play this at 240p feel like a 80s hit song ngl
these two seriously got together to bring penis music back
release the ALTERNATE VIDEO.....PPPPLLLLLEEEAAAAASSSEEE!!!
Ken Hirai would kill to join them.
Lmaoo man went from “ drippin in finesse” to “getting finessed” 💀💀💀
I love everything
Back when Bruno dropped Grenade,  i never would have thought in my entire life I would see this man dancing, with a square in hand and singing lines starting with “This BITCH- 😂😂😂
bruno aint catching a gernade for you anymore
mans went from "I'll catch a grenade for ya" to "this bitch got me paying for rent" 😭😭😭
WOW
1:44 i love his Ninoy Aquino impression
I was literally smoking out the window thinking "how could she do this to me", then I found this song.
Trippin on finesse
That's what we needdddd! 👍❤
This sounds like Switch, Debarge and the Deele. All  rolled up in one. Shoot em up movies, calling all girls and I wanna be closer.
Ninoy Aquino Join the Group
Kenapa candu bgt nih lagu 😭
Hilarious!!!!
E assim vão aprendendo a respeitar o grande artista que é Bruno Mars Até quando vão menosprezar o talento de hoje comparando com os do passado?
Still got that 1980s MTV vibe going.......and i fucking love it!!!!!👏👏👏👏
Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve found the next James Brown
Should've kept that door closed
Paak is a zombie now, a walking dead. That was EPIC! The fool was dead and we didn't know until the camera zoomed out.🤣😂 Somebody better give this video a damn award!🏆🏆🏆
RiP
The showmanship. Laid on the floor, he sold me. She a bitch. Lol
Somebody sporting that Baby Bobby Womack look 🤣
monstro!!
This song is funny and I love the  Visual
Ok this got oran juice Jones beat! The way Anderson Paak kept popping up from nowhere had me tears laughing
this song slaps so hard it left a mark on my girls ass when I played it in the car
Shout out to Bootsy Collins for making this happen
Anderson on the floor— I’m dead 😂😂😂😂😂
Bruno Mars's music really went from I'm a catch a grenade for you to I'mma throw a grenade at you
This is superb🔥I love you Bruno!!!❤️❤️❤️👌🏼👏🏼
0:31 best part of the song
OOHHH you if you guys love this guy you'll really like THIS guy....   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR47jrbdi64
Quem venho pelo Bruno do canal social arts, haha Miqueinha Luis Felipe
He really bring back the 70's❤️❤️❤️
God I just love them 💖💖💖💖💖💖
Thanks to everyone in Silk Sonic for bringing back Mo-Town. They're doing the 60's & 70's Mo-town/R&B justice. They just don't make music like THIS these days. I'm loving it
"I hope yo trifling ass walking round barefoot in these streets" kills me bcuz my grandaddy used to say this to his kids mama (btw she really was trifling)
Anderson and Bruno are handsome but who tf is big boy  in the back on the left? His juicy self looking pretty sexy ❤ 😍  lol
Love it
This is a masterpiece.
I LOVE THIS ALBUM   IS PERFECT!! :3
the girl is free the girl wants freedom the girl wants to live A love without commitment. Singing you still can! Love and accept just as she is!  (oh, no!)
One of my favourite melodic singer🔥💜
Classic album!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 We were not ready for something so smooth... but we needed it🙌 Well done!
In 2021 this borders parody at every turn except it's paradoxically brilliant
Every note, Ever step, Every shot, every cut... FLAWLESS.   I don't see how this could be any better
1:36 me on my wedding day.
This song is hitting a nerve for lots of guys and the set up back to the 70s is great way to show it. Choreography is like it should be and was back then with groups. Spot on gents, great damn job, Bruno Mars another winning hit. Keep this going must have a part two.
This song hits different when you catch your girlfriend cheating on you with your best friend.
this is a cuck anthem
Bruno Mars went from I’ll catching a grenade for women to calling them bitchs…. She must have been a special kinda crazy
i wanna marry everyone is this video clip
I can’t lie the backup dancers moves was smooth as hell.
Ctfu 😂😂😂😂😂song of the year goes to burno Mars 😂😂🤣🤣🤣✌👌
That boy said got the bad kids running round the house like its chucky cheese lol 😆
When Anderson dropped dead I almost died too🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is a bad ass video. I hope this group never break up.
This is the smoothest shit I've ever heard. Kudos.
Bruno Mars studio has a Time Machine and he goes to Motown Records before he writes song
'... bare foot on the street'   *preach*
Girls during a breakup: "He didn't deserve  you" Boys during a breakup:
Hercules! Hercules!
They look good in those brown suits.
If Anderson doesn’t fall on the ground at the AMAs tonight, that’s a missed opportunity.
this is so pretty
What happend to caching granades for you? 😆 🤣 😂
A jam 😍🥰
When Anderson Paak popped up singing: “Smokin out da window of the Benzo. The Benzo!” 😂😂😂🤣😭
14K people need to have their heads examined.
Anderson thumped that cig with conviction 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
That note right out of the 70's 2:43
oml i fell  in love again and again and again. Bruno's been my crush since I was in elementary school, and I'm 20 now and he 's still my crush.  UUUUUUghhh
Can I please get a Fortnite emote to this song?
Just when you think there's no more music to groove and move ya, here these men come with a heart's desire to have that real FUNK FROM BACK IN THE DAY BOOTSY COLLINS,  THERE WAS A JONES IN MY BONES, AND SILK SONIC JUST EASE MY PAIN.  THANK YOUS
My favorite song
LMAO I CRACKED UP 1:41
Gold Digger but make it R&B.

The most emphatic vocal I've heard on a record in a long while at 2:44 there by Bruno, wow!
Now that the SHIT!!!  I got money ready to purchase!  I need this for my collection!!
Excellent song
This swaaaag 😝
I didn't know they made a sound about my ex
Paak is too funny 💖

Red Pill..
It won't be hard to get a billion views at this rate I'll probably watch it 10k more times.
This shit is so smooth
A YouTube ad I actually didn't want to skip
Why does Bruno look so skinny!?
Oh so smooth . . . loving it!!
Did you see him jump off the floor 🤣
This is real music
Why couldn't this song come out 5 weeks ago
Nobody: You guys wanna see a dead body?  Anderson Paak: hold my cigarette.
HILARIOUS! Love this track.
This video, the choreography, the music, all of it...ICONIC. They have a mission to bring music back and they're doing it.
Muito bom.👏👍😷
Well guys you have TRULY out done yourselves 🤗🤗🤗
I feel like everyone else can stop making music now.
Missed opportunity to call it, “Silk Chronic”
1:44 THE WAY HE STAYS ON THE GROUND
'Just the other night she was grippin on me tight screamin' Hercules'   I can't x)
bruno and Anderson paak absolutely brilliant
damn brun went from 'imma leave the door open' to ' get the fucl outta here' with this song
I want to be that kind of girl that made that Bruno Mars paying her rent 🤣🤣🤣
Best choreography ever!!
Y’all don’t understand. When that camera shakes— LORDDDDD
The 70's vibe and moves are on POINT!!!!!  Creative thought is OFF THE CHARTS!!!!!  Another spectacular addition to the world of music y'all!
ahahahah so dramatic
Lol 😂 this put me in a better mood before work
I'm sorry but when Bruno says "this BITCH" it has me dead everytime.
This is absolutely brilliant
This song is for me ... Did BM read my message ?....😁🤭😁💋
Add a public comment…
Anderson literally died🤣
Every note, Ever step, Every shot, every cut... FLAWLESS.   I don't see how this could be any better
We need more song like this
Talented and hilarious cause Paak jumping up from the floor to start singing again sent meh 😂😭🤣
This song too bad 🔥🔥🔥. This is what we NEED!!!
Yo, their vibes are so on point😎 💯Paak on the floor cracks me hell up💨then pops right up
Bruno Mars is such a "just me n my homies" vibe and I love every bit of it.
Guy playing like 19s and still killing it
lord jesus if my grandma was alive she would love this. This made my day
The 14k dislikes  is the bitches they paying rent for
Went from "catch a grenade for ya" to "catch this grenade bitch"
I feel like for the first time Bruno is not singing ab how she loves (his) woman I mean especially this 1:37
first album I been motivated to buy in years...this duo is fire!
Garbage.
Bruninho não erra nunca!!!
nobody belongs to anybody. we are gods children and belong to him alone.
Sensacional💃🎼🕺
aside from music these guys are so so funny.
I used to hate Bruno Mars with passion. Now dis bitch got me playing this song on repeat and sharing it with everyone. I vote this the best song and music video of 2021 hands down.
I bet these guys had a ball writing those songs. Totally unapologetic, completely politically incorrect, fantastically funny, 100% owned and crazily funny. Add some great grooves to it and you have a Masterpiece. Bravo!
That harmony + bass *screams outloud and throws his chair and stomps foot once* Fuck it is so good!
Any friend i talk to who happens to be female gets mad at this song 😂😂😂. How many songs say men ain't shit you know ? This song is only talking about one women though so it ain't the same
This. Bitch. Got me paying her rent.
Had to make one for the fellas who get caught up with selfish and ungrateful women bigg ups Bruno and Anderson for this 1💯
lmao
I think it was the best birthday gift in my life (my birthday was when this song was released).
I like the song but it’s funny 😆
recycled generic 70's forgettable sound....  It's fresh to those who have not listened to anything before 2001...  I bet you if an obscure 1975 rnb '45 was re-released today with so much hype, it'd get 1 billion views.
Maybe that's what happens when you leave the door open. Lol
my fave song right now hands down.....
Admit that you've put this on repeat. 🖐🏽
1:43 RIP Anderson .Paak! 😂
An NBA team should get Bruno Mars on the team cuz he never misses
Great red pill song! Goes straight to the poisonous spiders of "empowerment"; every action generates a reaction, this is valid for the social sphere. We are reaching a point where a man cannot breathe without being considered aggressive. The red pill for gentlemen is the reaction.  There are good men; when they believe in certain women, who come into his life, those women make his life hell as they climb their altar of lust, at the same time, they applaud and give pleasure to the rogue men.  Being good doesn't mean being weak. watch?v=dba9hSAOIdY
Now I just wanna eat smoked salmon, is that weird?
One  of the greatest videos of all time.
I BELONG TO JEHOVAH GOD AND JESUS CHRIST AND THEN THE MAN I MARRIE  JOHN 17: 17!
He and this genre is just...perfect
This Bitch got me paying her rent smh
Mars Pill
I'm convinced Anderson .Paak is a super human bc of the way he kept popping up in front of the camera so quick and smoothly lol
É golpe atrás de golpe...
1:44 has meme potential
0:32 I just let my guard down to this one
Handsome my Bruno Mars!  I love this song! ❤❤❤❤
Lagta hai bhai ka breakup ho gya💔💔💔
Snoop dogg tried to tell you in the 90's.
That was epic
Change the everybody everybody to "to the streets" "to the streets" in a slightly lower octave.
Flawless!
I like the fact that the first video that pops up when you search 'this b***h' is this
Nitidamente a letra fala de um caso do cara com uma mãe solteira e da burrada que é se envolver com uma mulher assim... #redpill
1:35
I got my package set today!! I'm wearing my shirt tonight for the AMA show!!
Mientras veía el vídeo, pensaba quién me gusta más; Bruno Mars o Anderson .Paak... ¡Los dos son geniales! Tan talentosos, sus voces increíbles, compositores, músicos completos... ¡Están llenos de magia!🎶🎵🎤💕 ...Pero de pronto ví a Anderson .Paak tirado en el suelo y morí de risa!!! 😁😂❤️ Jajaja ¡Me encantan las ocurrencias de ese hombrecito!  En esta canción, para mí, un punto para Anderson, bebé, .Paak. 😁😍
Perfeição ❤️❤️❤️
The way they are vibing !!😩
Great Song 👏👏👏
This song is so hard. Gave me flashbacks paying trips and this B going got me sitting here alone.
Bruno Mars’s age is here..
Dang bruno you really are amazing 8/9 songs after coming back. Worth the wait everytime.
I have this song on repeat 😍 I love everything about this song including the video
So my guy got heartbreak again
A song for that red pill for the guys who are in this blu pill in life. Bruno Maras, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic best song (y)  Una canción para esa pastilla roja para los chicos que están en esta pastilla azul en la vida. Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Mejor canción de Silk Sonic (y)  Песня об этой красной таблетке для парней, которые принимают эту синюю таблетку в жизни. Бруно Марас, Андерсон Паак, Лучшая песня Silk Sonic Lol
Cadê os br
🥰💕meltin 💓
Love how Bruno Mars has had those “band members” (the black dudes dancing with him) since way back in the day, I think even before his single “Treasure”
This collab isn’t new though? Remember silk sonic? Love it
waiting for _"this b— got me paying her rent"_ to be a meme
She belongs to everybody/ the streets rent her dont marry her nice song 😅
Best funniest song ever!
I'm going to view this song as satire because the lyrics are definitely over the top
1:36 Bruno really went from catching the grenade to throwing it
14k people slid onto the dislike button cause this song is so smooth.
Almost forgot to watch this again today.
Anderson Paak laid out on the floor! Lol....that man is funny as hell....great song!
Ghostface Killah needs to be on the remix
" She belongs to the street" song
great to see bro back on the trap kit
Hit song🔥🔥🔥🔥
Classic Bruno Mars  x) Pretty good song, even though I keep laughing listening to the lyrics x)
It is so amazing 🤩💪💯👍💐🤩🤩
Tiktok people is now using this masterpiece for their "content" 👁️👄👁️
Don’t date single moms. She cares more about your wallet than your heart.
Legendary.
Absolutely indomitable amounts of swag
My boyfriend said Bruno's thinner in this video and I just replied with, that's because he's just smoking out the window singin' bout girl
🤣🤣🤣how he got back up so fast???
sum up its a "she belongs to the street" song
0:32 Did She?
Visuals and clarity is on point. You are inspiration 🎞👌🏿https://youtu.be/9gcJqIXYP40
Bruno always gives us masterpieces.
He is so dramatic 🙄
Wow
Bruno Mars 36 years of age and still making hits. I’m So happy living through this whole process 👌🏽
Does the new update of  youtube do not show dislikes now? Or it's just a video without a dislike?
alle frauen die sich dadurch angesprochen fühlen geben denn dislike hahaha
1:43
Omg my radio dj is right!!! Add #Miguel now!!!
Sugar daddy song. Haahaahaaahaaaa
0.75x slapssss
When I played this song, I felt the smell of Grammy <33
bro that camera shake at the start was so fucking smooth.
So happy to see Anderson .Paak blow up like this
Honey for ears even if the story is heartbreaking haha
I sweat I'm rewatching this video more than any video I ever had
*aghhhh, the 19's vibee i love itt <333*
Man it was the cigarettes making it through the whole video that took me out. Sometimes keeping it simple is all it takes. Best video I've seen in a LOOOONG time.
I don't know why this remembers me gta san
If "She belongs to the streets" had a theme song it'd be this
if i found out this album was recorded in a studio and not on a stage like that i will flip
nah its 2021 bruno mars threw the grenade back
im gay but no one gonna find this comment
Silk Sonic is the best thing that happened in 2021! 🤩
lang ya ka bruno.... kakainlab ka jud.. hahaha!
Omg am I the only one  know  that song lyrics  they did sound  like the same song  tlc did years ago  calling  digging on you 😳  they need to  quit it   cut it out please  do not  hesitate  copying  tlc  song.....
Ain't gonna lie but this makes me feel sad and old because of those retro lookin vibes.
This is so expensive
Shout out sa mga nasa alter HAHAHAHAHAHA
My favorite collage band did this song the other day!!! The band and the Stingettes killed it‼️ #ASU #ASUBAND #STINGETTES #2021 #ALABAMASTATE
bruh my name really explains who bruno has became
Realzinha...
I repeat this video just to watch Anderson .Paak playing dead on the ground (the song is a masterpiece too, mind)
I love this song😊
Maybe the "bitch" prefers a non-smoker.
don't be captain save hole just said no to the thirsty man
This song teaches us not to simp
That carpet on the stage though!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Anderson .Paak jumping from the left is so hilarious
OMG Bravo Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars.  this is deliciously fun!  So retro - my youth, HAH HA HAH HAA HA.
Bruno breaking down to his knees and getting back up in step. It's almost gay have much I like this nigga.
Red pill music
I LOVE THIS SONGGGGGGGGGGG
That is some real shit, sung real sweetly.. Lol
https://youtu.be/YFrby55WyQg
I can't believe that , IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
I love it!!!!!!
How can be Bruno so smooth in his dance moves
Esto no es música  es magia
This kind of sounds like Never Can Say Goodbye by Jackson 5, does anyone else hear it?
Litteraly his best era
70s RnB be like:
Good song for Silk Sonic
90's Vibes 😍😍
Wut da Paak doin? 1:44
This song equals : “city boys down bad” lol
Anderson playing dead is the funniest thing!
why was that guy laying on the floor lol
Berta Top 20 🎯 Charts 11-21-2021 Top 12. LW:9 Peak:9 Weeks:2
I'm so glad to hear music like this again.  This is that take your time music right here...
Magic song spectacular music
How do they do this without laughing so hard?!
Ok Google
bestsongever
Did anyone listen to Grenade by Bruno Mars after this song & after reading that comment saying he threw the grenade back 💀
This is a funny ass video. Anderson.Paak took mesmooth TF out
bruno threw the grenade back lol
Cuando te preguntas: que pasa si mezclo el chocolate con el Dulce de leche?' Esto es lo que pasa!
So sexy bruno
Cara é muito bom ouvir essa música 😃😍😍 parabéns  Bruno Mars
Y'ALL DID IT AGAIN...ONCE AGAIN ONE GREAT SOUND  .....LOVE IT 💜💜💜💜😋😋😋😋💋💋💋💯💯💯‼️👍👍👍✌✌✌✌👋👋👋👋
a/k/a Redpilled 👈 or "She for the skreetzz!!"
The tribute to the ‘70’s R&B is spot on. The lyrics of this song is so flipping clever, pushing as hard as you can on that misogyny button (ain’t too proud to beg) only with a wink and a nudge while wearing cheesy velvet and giant medallions. Just as smooth sounding as the real thing.
amazing
🔥🔥🔥
Wooowwww
The simp song of the year.🤣🤣🤣
Who's vocals are better than Bruno Mars......who is still currently making music....I'll wait
Monica so gone sample ??
Good music is alive!!! This made me cry!!!!
That first voice at the intro sounds like Bootsy.
Aderson .Paak×Bruno Mars is the real deal!!
Simplesmente incrível 😍😍😍
New boys band🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who hurt my man's, he was willing to "catch a grenade for ya"
Who says "This...Bitch...got me payin' her rent!" Better? Paak or Bruno?
😂when Anderson Paak is down, look at Bruno Mars face as if he's going to burst into laughter 😂😂😂
This has to be Anderson.Paak at his best
This is straight up fye
Damn , It was so good on the second time I saw it and on.
Just ordered. Can't wait !!!  They're soooo smooth.
Future should be featured in this 😂
I guess she didn't come lay in those arms when they left the door open for her🤔
Hear this song with cigeretes in my hand and damn so good
This song reminds me of my youth in the 40s...       Just kidding 😀😀😀
When Anderson Paak laid on the floor...."I died!"' 🤣🤣🤣🤣 #bestmoment
me :listening without watching they MV (thinking it's gonna be typical bruno stuff) music video :paak playing dead me: wht the fff... *tear of joy*
💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ol school 🎶music 🎶vibe takin me back to those good ol days.  👍🎶💖
Redpill saves lives, wake up to life, step out of illusion and into reality
Dear Bruno Mars and Anderson, this song is a gem. One of your best.
Shootout to the backup singer dancing with the cig in his hand
how to smokin out the window??? because I live in the basement。。。。。
hey, me too....
Gotta thank that bitch though he wasn't paying her rent we won't get thise but heey don't pay no bitch rent aight
Bruno gone have wheelchairs n walking sticks in audience for his tours
I wish he said “she belongs to the streets” instead of “she belongs to everybody”
Singing along and in the most over the top way "this BITCH GOT ME PAYIN HER RENT" my wife just looked at me real scared 👀
Bruno be second mj
love this song!
Holy cow this is so addicting
"this bitch got me payin the rent" vs. "you should've paid my rent!!!! go get a fucking job!!!"
beautimus
I really feel like if he was still here Mac Miller would’ve been on this
Hey
Someone commented that retro aesthetic is where Bruno Mars shines better, Well, I am just gonna say this. If this is where he is best, and those genre of music back then is where he got famous. Then that proves that he is an AMAZING SINGER. And let’s not forget Anderson Paak. HE IS ALSO AN AMAZING SINGER. The vibe, the aesthetic of this album and the singers and the tunes makes this album ✨ AMAZING ✨ I don’t even think “amazing” is the appropriate word to describe this. But thats how far my vocabulary goes.
my favorite thing about this is that they spelt “download” wrong in the description
Literally my favorite song rn, best song of 2021
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
so oldies vibe like it likee that
When people say modern music sucks, show them this.
Everything these two do sizzles. Where the heartbreakers, because this makes me want to start smoking again.
Unos morenos con suinnnmm✨
Anderson Paak flicking cigarette ash on the stage in his intro scene: iconic.
God music
This music video looks great damn good song
Yo Bruno what happened to you my guy XD
I really love this songs of silksonic more songs to come very relaxing ❤️❤️
Que som é esse!!!😍😍... Essa pegada retrô é tudooo. PERFEITO!!!
1st of all I love this man 2nd of all I'm dying for new music 3rd of all just the beginning made me almost cry , that's how happy I am to discover  new music  4th of all I really do love this man and how he sings.
I like the vibe of this song, But they should've cast Bruno to play Bobby Debarge in that Luke tv movie
Great song, but it can also be a SNL parody skit. The lyrics are so funny.
Singing, dancing and acting? Yes we have here sir
They is literally saying she belongs to the streets
excellent video
that was ridiculously satisfying to watch
https://youtu.be/dtdXC7AOBt8
Love from Malaysia :) ❤️🇲🇾
AMAZING!!!!!!
Loving it
The Jackson's vol.2 😍😉
Can I just say that Anderson just completed Bruno Mars?
I can believe they really bringing back the old school steps, suits.WOW.nice
Amo suas músicas , vc é um dos melhores cantores do mundo. Parabéns!!!! Desejo muito mais sucesso.
Am I the only one who thinks Jamie Foxx would be perfect on this?
Top.
What an awesome song and video.  I can listen to this over and over and over.
i said they couldnt do it again  was wrong so wrong
This is gonna be one of the best R&B songs of all time y'all wait
anderson represents us all, who says they are not dramatic but always ends up doing the most melodramatic thing ever....
Look now.......I'm impressed and I just want to say kudos!!! GaaaaaDammmmmnn that was dope!!!! 💊💨
Sammy Davis Jr?
Bruno Mars has nothing to prouve, he is an amazing singer, performer,vocalist.  He is now enjoying the art he is making  Would love to have the opportunities in my love for live of that type of art, my passion. Congrats to Bruno Mars, Anderson. Paak, Silk Sonic  And ur productions 👏🏽
Oh wow....
andy is so dramatic lol, i love it🤣🤣🤣❤
Banger
This song makes me not to pay my rent
This song has driven me to the point of making out a dance of just…..SMH….☺️😉SPEECHLESS, ……. Smoother than smooth✨✨✨🔥
Marvin Gaye and Barry White be smiling in heaven. 🥰
I'm mad at myself cause I found this  song 2 weeks  after release :)
I really like this song. Hope you'll also gonna like this karaoke version of smokin in the window. https://youtu.be/9tPdImzzGHs
Bruno Mars, will never get old. Beautiful Collab with Anderson, I hope this duo lasts forever.  Skate was also on point.
What wonderful song ! Que música maravilhosa !
Godammit again!anotha one!
Simps when they donate millions of dollars to a twitch Thot, but then she introduces her Boyfriend.
It's good to see a famous artist like Bruno Mars spreading Redpill through his music...
2:44 that part is just so damn good 😩
Bruno went from “I would catch a grenade for you” to this. :)
I think Bitch is to much, but for the rest I like this song ! It's so cool !
Cool 😎
Absolutely have to tip my hat to Bruno, Anderson, Bootsy and everyone else involved in this track and the album altogether. This album is smooth like silk but has definite banger qualities. THANK YOU GENTLEMEN
This makes me so happy!:)) Jesus! They're so cool.
🔥
Silk Sonic 🔥
"Now I gotta give you back to the city! LOL!!!!!
Who else is listening again and again?
I appreciate them trying to keep that old school vibe going. The music today is trash and Bruno Mars understands real music. Sad to say the record executives today is young, white, got two left ears and out of touch with the real black experience. R&B and funk was assassinated since they couldn't put white folks pictures on the album covers anymore.
Very nice...I wonder if Bruno and Anderson are Corey Holcomb fans cus he been doing these types songs on his 5150 Show for years...Salute...
This song gives me heavy Marvin Gaye vibes
This b$%ch got me!
LOOK HEA!!! 🤍🤍🤍
YOOOOOO!!! THEY KILLING ME!!! THIS SONG SO FLY AND THE VIDEO FUNNY ASF!!!
This is sick, we got a glorious song, fantastic harmonies, superb moves, brilliant set, dapper outfits and trolling all the way. Hat's off chaps, this is hands down the best thing I have witnessed in an age.
Idk what it is but Anderson is looking so sexy in this video 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
And just like that! Bruno has done it again 🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍
The soul and Motown vibes are strong in this song!!
Oldschool 😃cool 🍷🦋✨
2:44 Bruno Mars goes Super Saiyan
1:33 your welcome
So genial.......erinnert mich sehr an die Zeit von Silk, Keath Sweat.......
Awesome loving this song.
Let's give some praise to Anderson paak, he killed it too!!!
This gotta be the smoothest, vibiest song from Bruno Mars I've ever listened too. This is addicting.
Gotta give you back to the streets 😪😂
1:43 am on the floor laughing
*Music Video Of The Year*
This funk *UNBELIEVABLE* 🌈☁️9️⃣🎶🎵
Otis Williams from the temptations you have 24 hrs to respond sir lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣
this is Sunday morning cleaning vibes
okay but when bruno pointed i instantly fell back in love
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. ALL THE COMMENTS HERE JUST SAY THE WORDS I CAN'T RLLY EXPLAIN. IT'S A MASTERPIECE, TOGETHER WITH THE WHOLE ALBUM ! AAAAAAAAA
❤ 🔥 👏 love love love this, love them.
So good💗💗💗
They should do a limited edition jazz club tour, I'd pay to see that for sure!
A complete bop at 1.25 speed
I am Simply Obsessed <33
I'm here for it LOLLL
Que grandes, que estilo, que clase, que nivelazo, es innato lo llevan en la sangre💛 desde Barcelona.

This is real
😂😂🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏
We need more songs like this. (scrap the lyrics) Pls let us go back to the early and mid 2000s. The feel of music back then was just so good.
The Passion behind BITCH!!! brought me here for the "Victim of Codependency" anthem of 2021
This will wake all you simps up.
Social Arts? mais alguém?
Wow, I haven't heard a new Bruno Mars song for a while!
2 weeks after and still trending 😩
Coolest colab ever, absolutely love them
Am I the only one to hear a fast version of Versace on the Floor ? :-)
This video gave me Saturday night live vibes😂😂🔥
Feel like smoking a cig right now, not sure know why.
It's like your not even in 2021
1:35
Anderson and Bruno.. perfect together.  Anderson is the most underrated artist. He's been out for a long time with GoldLink......Bruno didn't put him on the map but shined a light on him.
I'm going through this right now, I just wasn't dumb enough to spin up all my money
this video increases cigarette sales constantly!
lmao when they are smoking the cigarettes'
the best featuring!!
Not to be dramatic... No absolute no soul: Anderson falls down dead
This vibe is what we need right now
Never disappoints at all I know this is album of the year
It’s the J5 moves for me. Bringing back memories…
I Love it xoxoxo
This one's for us fellas lol
😆😂😂
Damn. My man really threw the grenade back
Bruno has the voice of an angel .👼
My nigga in my Denzel voice

You guys are legends!! 🌠
It's very good song
Whoever disliked this video was paid to do so, or is recovering from lung cancer. There can be no other reasons.
Loving itt
the choreography!!!!!! the way you dance , bruno nena, has an indescribable effects on me😭😭😭
Quebraram o coração do último homem romântico do mundo
what a fancy way to say that she belong to the street
In case you didn’t know, a Bruno / Paak colab is exactly what the world needs right now.
Profoundly classic minimal choreography
RedPill...
Its hard to find friends who wear the same style as you do
This is funny to me
1:18
Every part of this song are the best and hilarious lmao ♥️♥️♥️
😳 Wow....... They make that era look absolutely fun and drama free....I love it
DAMN BRUNO IS JUST A DIFFERENT TYPE OF BREED AND 100% ONE OF THE ALL TIME GREATEST OF ALL TIME!
Another hit Bruno is always on point.🔥🔥🔥
Q música boa q som gostoso nossa 😍
When bruno mars says she had me spending 45,000 in tiffany's...I'm sooo weakkk when he says ohhhhhh nooooo lol
2:20 why does this reminds of Hamilton's "Say no to this"???
Why would anyone even think about disliking this once in a lifetime kind of art😢❤
I can’t wait till they come in concert!!
He threw that grenade back
I want that costume O_O
Lesson Learned. Don't be a SIMP
I want more of these aesthetics from Bruno Mars honestly
Pinche canción espectacular 😭😭

BRA ALL THEY MISSING IS FUTURE
"Smokin Out The Window"  Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
🔥🔥It’s The Lyrics For Me🔥🔥
So this is what happens when your sugar baby left you. LOL
Everybody talking about the cosmetics of the video and the sound of the music, which was top notch however is anyone focusing on *the message* about most of these trifling so-called modern day women with their baggage of spoilt children, overly dependent ass and lacking the ability to stick to one man? brothers be wise
Amazing🇻🇳❤️

Bruno prayed to his Puertorican ancestors for that old school flow and it shows 🤣 with his Jewish and Filipino ancestors adding a extra drama and spice to the mix.
This is such amazing song they nailed it
Slick, retro and what a shuffle, makes me smile, such a choon ❤
This song is so comedic but also so artistic and atheistic lol love it

Saturday, November 20, 2021 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Wished MJ is still alive and had a collaboration with Bruno. Hell yeah, Bruno is really not messing up with his music! Already a Legend at a very young age .)
Seriously!  In a world of climate change and more focus on health, do we really need to see people smoking in a video?!?!?!?

This is like a Theatrical music performance on The Eric Andre's Show
this is wad we call singing
Bruno got some ism and flipped his style
WOW! Silk Sonic this album is crazy awesome
These guys are playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers
Protect Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak and Silk Sonic at all cost 🙏🏽💯
When you can sing and have a great sense of humour : Anderson. Paak
How can they come up with more and more legendary songs every single time like.. This video also being a masterpiece...
This is the fanciest way someone has said they're stressed
DOPE. More of this!!!
It's a sad song, right?
Perfect 🎼🎤❤
Siiiiii jajajajajajajaj no fue  para nada dramático 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love u all

Leave the door open?? Smoking out the window?? Somethings wrong with there house
Who's screaming in the background of this track... Bruno?

I like this song! :) Bruno is so talented and a great singer and anderson is a good singer too! :)
I gotta give you back to the city. Lol

Postmodernism ain't dead after all.
When Anderson Pack said Bitch at the beginning he had me laughing
Bruno really went from Thats what I like to You're what I hate..
Y’all wanna be poor
https://youtu.be/YwQRC2APEy8
The drumming is so crispy though 😅
Did you know that Bruno Mars' net worth is well over 175 Million dollars?  However, it is speculated that it drastically decreased because this bitch got him paying for rent, paying for trips.
This B.... WTF! spoilt the track for me!
I’m the opposite of most people watching this. This is the first time I’ve listened to a whole Bruno Mars album. I’m an Anderson fan. I love it though.
She belonged to the Streeeeets!!!
Went from catching a grenade for a bitch to throw em😂😂
It’s soo smooth
That is badass!
Guess someone’s trifling @ss is walking barefoot in these streets 👀
“Not to be dramatic but i want to die” And then he proceeds to just fall on the floor 💀💀
Anderson .Paak showed his whole ass in this video and I am here for it!

Multi million dollar artist singing a song about being rinsed by a single mother.

Anderson Paak Bruno Mars Silk Sonic I don't know where y'all came from, but where have y'all been. Love the music, best music I've heard in long time. Write a song called ( Bringing it back ) Music not rap. Singing, not talking, from the heart not from the head. Real music.
Comedic and musical perfection. Thanks, guys 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the music we’ve all been missing. The album is so good!!
The 70s sound is back. Thank you God!

The way he pops back up out of nowhere is what makes this for me.
I like the reference to Chuck E. Cheese.  It looks like they're performing at Chuck E. Cheese Pizza Time Theater, for christssake... lol
Bro can anyone find they outfit cause now I want it
Anderson on the ground after saying " not to be dramatic". lmao
13,000 dislikes!?! OK... Any young person can have an opinion but do they have any understanding of how this glorifies and does justice to an era of music beyond your comprehension? Tell me about Smokey Robinson without Google. Yea, that's what I thought.
The bend 😂😂
Bruno ain't simping no more
Bruno ain't talking to the moon no more
100% pure talent this

Bruno WTF, who hurt you😂

"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.  For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." Ecclesiastes 12:13‭-‬14  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Hebrews 9:27  "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16  "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." John 14:6   "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Romans 6:23

Bruno went from leaving the morphine at his door when his girl left to B*tch get out my house. This girl got my boo's Anderson and Bruno going through it. 🤣🤣
Grammys were made to be given to songs and albums like these If it does not happen... man that says somethin about society Its a shame this is at 8th place on billboard rn they gotta get their game straight
Mac would be so proud
Why is this so addicted ?
if this album doesn't get a grammy, so the grammy judges are deaf.
This is my new jam now 🤣🤣🤣
I guess their songs are about one girl...is it? Skate - their first met Leave The Door Open - after some date After Last Night - happened the night after they left the door open, and the girl knew they're rich Smokin Out The Window - just after they realized the girl got them paid her rent, trips & bought her diamonds.. Put On a Smile - their deep feeling after they got the girl back to the city
Iklan rokok 😅
Them brothers done took soul/r & b to a whole nother level!!

Not want to be dramatic  but I want to die,,, this b@shhh  got me paying her trips
Just noticed that Paak  has Stevie Wonder tattooed on his chest lol
The way Bruno sings "35 45" UGH 😫😫❤️👍🤍✨🪐✨✨

Call me crazy but Silk Sonic was one of the greatest things to ever occur in music
This man bruno mars is fine. Damn

Can we get a vinyl please! That's all that's missing. Everything was on point: Cigarettes in hand, Vintage microphone  Brown, bell-bottom, butterfly collar suits, vocals, the stops, slide-outs, the dramatic faints, even the "B's" in the lyrics was on point.  Real music❤
time to sell that versace on the floor

I just imagine that those are blunts shaped to look like cigarettes, even if they likely really aren't. It gives me a lot of satisfaction.
I have a problem, I can’t stop listening to this song
That's YOUR FAULT for leaving the door open for a wrong bitch. HAHAHA
I love how Bruno went from singing just the way you areeee to THIS BITCH
Rut si ves esto te amo <3

Jesus Christ died for you so live for him
Bruno mars is so funny
I wish my late wife was alive to hear these two on this album together. She may have been an 80s baby but she loved her 60s and 70s music.
Bruno is making my day happy when I listen to him 💖🎯💯🤗🤗🤗🤗
This song took the words right out my mouth when I was dating this ghetto woman from the hood and her kids running through my house
Bruno Mars got me pounding on my chest babe baby🦍😫❤️
This song took the words out of my mouth when I was dating this
https://youtu.be/1jelZb3nR4g
Lost himself at 0:33.
I love this & us ladies definitely have our pick of anthems but THIS...gentlemen, y'all got 1😂 it's such a perfectly arranged song. Anderson's emphasis on B**** is chef's kiss lol

A good how to on making  a pop record. A superb song construction with buckets of personality. 10/10
when he said “and here i am all alone” i felt that
Sounds really good at 1.5 times speed too
it's a darn Thursday night and I don't have any plans to be in town until next Monday 🙃
Who hurt Bruno y’all tripping 😂😭😭😭imma end up fighting bruh😭😭
he really said "she belongs to the streets"
This is like a well sung SNL skit lol.  Also this reminds me of Dedication to my Ex by Lloyd 😂.
This bitch made songs like this available for us
Fire, y’all Brothas killin it.
I can't help but laugh at the lyrics of this song😂. But i love this song 💜
I love this song and the video 🔥🔥🔥

Has anyone else noticed their cigarettes? One min they're short, the next they're long again. Lol
Who smell 👃 music award 🥇 and not just the cigar
O Bruno parece bem confortável nesse estilo.
Love the song. Just saying though why ya'll have to call ladies Bitches.
Don't even sing a song ever
Clearly the best video this year. Bruno Mars conviction and Anderson Paak dramatics is the perfect combination!!!
This is why i love all their styles. they be bringing back the old cool ways with style! everything about this work is great :D
That drummer paying his bills on time 💯💯
This me singing wit my backwood
Fuck. Is masterpiece after masterpiece
This is a sophisticated way to say that you belong to the streets
Is that Bruno Marrs or Ike Turner?  GOTTA PUT SOME STANK ON IT!
This shit is perfect 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Listen to Anderson Paak reaching to much. Make sure you have a very fat blunt. You welcome.
1:51 Wow🔥🔥😂😂that's gold
Man in his 40s and Bruno the young cat I give ear too......always got that smooth joints I like
When you leave your Door Open too much
AMAZING....BEAUTIFUL...VOICES...PERFECT ...
“🎶🎤not to be dramatic but I wanna die🎶” Anderson Paak you are too funny! 🤣😂🤣

Everybody else just STOP!!!!!, They got this.
Flawless
the way i come back here every day
One word: Class! I'm mind full of Covid & Climate change. But this act is a must see would go down an absolute storm in my uk & EUROPE! they will be totally guaranteed sellout! They're simply "CLASS"! Not seen this type of act, lyrics, story telling, music, choreography set & dancing  in many many years. Its just wow. It is a hit even today. They seriously moved me. Take it wider guys, world wide if you can, "With our delicate planet in mind". Bless xx:))
L O V E 🎶
Jackson 5 memories ❤️❤️❤️
I definitely think you should make a album called the Bruno Blues
FUNNY A*S SH*T. I'M GONNA LIGHT ME UP A CIGARETTE AND I DON'T EVEN SMOKE AND WON'T SMOKE.
2021/80s
love these two so much
Bruno threw the grenade back
Classy way to say she belongs to the streets 💀💀💀💀
That god for them in music right now
she belongs to the streets  -Gandhi, probably
This….this…is art and music 😂😂 I love it
This is the 5th time I played this song today
When Bruno got off his knees and got right in step with the dance 👀
This song sounds like the most theatrical shit post I've ever heard and I love it so much!
Bruno ain't taking a grenade for no woman anymore after this song 🥲
Am I the only one that hears "Hercules 👏🏽 Hercules 👏🏽 Hercules 👏🏽" of The Nutty Professor Dinner scene? 🤣🤣🤣
This song and video has the best vibes ever. I think Anderson .Paak's  really makes it tho cause in almost all of his parts he's just being hilarious
This song red pill af. F simpn!
This has got to be the smoothest disstrack ever 🔥
Today is the Great American Smokeout Day!  Make a plan to quit tobacco forever!
See, this is why you don't leave the door open and just let any ole chick skate thru it...
“ THIS BITCH got me paying her rent, paying for trips” - Favorite Line
Bruno really threw the grenade back
YEAAAA YALL KILLED THISSSSS

One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈

Voilà de grand artiste talentueux!! Bravo à vous!!! Les français rament encore!!! Merci pour cette expérience musicale à caractère anachronique!!!
Those cigarette flicks.
I love bruno and Anderson
Ok so am i the only one who discovered this song via Youtube ad 😅😅😅
1:19
retro for ever!!!   genius
Bruno always have his unique style ✨
very nice !!!
Silk Sonic concerts are going to be lit
The only modern singers who produce complicated songs with live instrumentals and chord changes and progressions that u never hear anymore.
Man that retro aesthetic and sound is where Bruno shines so much better than his early stuff, his finally hitting his real stride and It is glorious.
How you go from Treasure to this??
Brah 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I'm done, this shit perfect
Man ow man they are a hitttttttt
Not the kid running around like it’s chucky  cheese 💀
🔥Ooooooweee!🔥 Red Pills are hard to swallow, but they're the best prophylactics for heartbreak/divorce/disease/unwanted pregnancies/unnecessary drama. Dont be that sorry dude hotboxxin da benz/bucket, sweatin some high maintenance freak that dont gaf about you... just *DON'T*
I'm a huge fan of both Anderson and Bruno individually, but this EP is by far the greatest work collectively from both of them.  It's just SO FUCKING GOOD.
Imagine a time traveler from the 70s would watch it and go like: am I really in 2021?
Hmm
Anderson Came off as My Guy David Ruffin!!! That’s not a knock either
13K couldn't stand the chaos in Chucky cheese
Who are the other people singing? They deserve more credit their vocals are amazing as well!
Out Window The Smoking
Bruno never disappoints.... ❤️
video producer: how many lens flares do you want bruno: yes
Now even a crazy popular band is singing about the new 304 pandemic. That’s how serious it is!
I’m getting Soul Train vibes from this
Damn ya'll made smoking look cool again!!!  Why???? Let me find my rolling papers!
expected. only one song is worth listening in the album lol. the rest is too generic just added to be called an album.
Someone tell me wear I can buy the sunglasses Bruno has on I need a pair asap
🥰❤‼️
Bruh... If that ain't what every man wanna say to a woman he trying to hit, But just ain't hit it yet... lol This BITCH out here having fun, while I'm sitting here waiting on her azz... lol
This is a Red Pilled song. They're singing about a girl that belongs to the skreets!!
Rick James, "This bitch!" Sammy Davis" The cigarette!" The Temptations, The dance moves!" The Nutty Professor", Eddie Murphy! Silk Sonic" She belongs to the streets!" They have captured a whole black vibes, here!
Funny song.
YAaaaS ❣🤭❤😅❤❤❤🔥
So fuckin smooth
Rip to all the brothas out there because them coochies are that powerful
Don’t be a step dad fellas
Goddamn these guy are magic!
j'adore...

This song and video is FIRE!!!  It's both entertaining (funny as hell) and smooth.  LOVE IT!!!
Paak: "Not to be dramatic, but--" Also Paak: *proceeds to do the most dramatic thing possible*
Is this supposed to be funny? Seems like a waste of talent or bad writing or something. But just can't take it seriously
Love it, bringing back the old school 🥰
Just A Reminder!! Not One Ash Was Dropped During This Video.  🤣 #Greatness
70s style
Its ironic how can be an unfortunate lover and a cursing lyric feels so nice and romantic haha
OMG!!! Love this!  Flawless.  Anderson Paak dying, then review and pops back up with new life!  The synergy with these two.  More please!
November 2021, Detroit,  Mi, bru, House Music all fuckin day, this track jams
Classiest way in telling a woman she’s a thot.

Nunca decepciona ❤️

Smoking and singing Bruno… wow you passed COVID-19
Forget belonging to the streets she belong to the city. Got Bruno changing from they ain't got nothing on you, to everybody been in you.
Sugar daddy anthem of the decade!!! This is half of the old heads taking the pics in Miami...

So this a good song and a great video.  BUT...the autotune just kills it for me.  I'm sorry.    You don't need the crap.
❤️‍🔥
We gone be talking bout this for decades! 😁🔥
Me : “ ** this song* * “ My rent : lol you better pay boy
This is the highlight of 2021 !  This collaboration was what I needed to regain faith in good music again ! I have yet to hear the whole album. Please let others follow their lead !
What happened to bruno? So thin.
This song is about a men who get cheat from her girlfriend,but doja cat song is about a girl who want to cheat her boyfriend,damm my brain is hurt

bruno's new songs are always bangers
The movement and song gives me slight asmr
National anthem
The continuity for those burning cigarettes...
God has a great plan for your life

The song is fire. The video takes the fire to another level
I love Bruno, but this song has humored me to the core. 🤣🤣🤣
Watch in 144p = real nostalgic
I promise, I memorised their steps here it was such a vibe😭
Love this song! My ONLY criticism is using "bitch" . Could've used chick or girl instead.  But...I do love the track.
bruno killing it    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!dont like the cigarettes  ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
This is our anthem to all that city girl shit in 2021 fellas. This song is a f*ckin vibe!!!
I donno but i feel like I've gone back to de 70s ... luv ya Bruno !!!
This song is fire and so magical
Bruno Mars is soul
Another top song..
In the world we live in today , with all the rest of the horse shit we have to deal with , I feel that dude that came in with " This Bitch " line...ruined it for me , personally. These guys could take a few lessons from one of my old favorites , New Edition and clean it up a little. Coulda said..." This girl " instead...Just my opinion tho.
she city property
This has to be the longest lit cigarette I've ever seen in my life
The sarcasm i cant- this song is so hilarious and melodious at the same time. Man's gone insane with the bills bwahaha, who hurt you guys oh mah gawd🥲💀
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are some of the only two things getting me through hard times, thank god for music! I love you! ❣️💖
Please tell me that stevie wonder chest piece is real
Bruno said "b*tch" so hard, he almost said "pitch" 😂❤️❤️

Everything he sings is masterpiece

When I grow up.
https://youtu.be/RcvA21yy5no missin yuuuuu brrruu
Ancora un'altra banalità. Sembra una canzone mediocre degli anni 80 caduta nel dimenticatoio.....
Holy moly... this feels like CSR 109.3. If you know this... you're the OG Familia. Bruno Mars success building his own time capsule... this has 1992 urban area. I love this
0:32 the way he slides in and says this bi*ch had me dead
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🔥🔥🔥
When Anderson. Paak plays dead with the cigarette still in his hand 😂😂😂
Proud Filipino here💓
Bruno Mars thank you for existing.
No seriously I’m so glad I’m still alive to hear this album
That is the best song or there today!!!! I'm in love again
Before he mentioned babyface what did they crossover?
she belongs to everybody...
I'm pretty sure the "Hercules" part was referencing "the nutty professor"
Love ❤️ it
I fucking Love it! This what me and best friend call parking lot pimping music... 😂💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💞
superb.! period
Perfection
I AM AWAITING
Anderson is himself wearing diamond on his writ, diamond on his neck 🤣😂

The perfect duo doesn’t ex…

The best music video I’ve seen in a while tbh The aesthetic, the comedy, the choreo, the song !!! Everything is so on point tysm for this 😩😩
Record of the year.
Well they should’ve never left the door open….
I feel like they're lightweight trolling us with this video 💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣
iconic
Their chemistry is on point.
This Man is still keeping his rhythm, my whole body is dancing 🔥.
Not me thinking they just made leavethe door open
after this song bruno Mars isnt caching grenades, he is thrwoing them
Anderson paak coming into frame saying "THIS BITCH" is the funniest shit
I love all of themmm😭💕🌎
Getting ready for work jamming 🥰
just got lung cancer, this song hits harder then newports
Boy got his David Ruffin glasses on,reviving history!!nice song,tho!
Nice song but I prefer songs just like Just The Way You Are, Uptownfunk, and all your other masterpieces Bruno Mars and Silk Sonic.
They just produce bangers the wait for along time was worth it cause they released so much bangers in 1 year things are turning up
I was first a fan then an air-conditioner then I became a windmill.
The choreography, the lush harmonies, the Song-of-the-Year-worthy tune and the off-the-charts vocals can be condensed into these words - Brilliant Bruno, Awesome Anderson.
Love this such a motown feel awesome
'She belongs to everybody.'  Say she a ho without saying she a ho.
Anderson Paak @1:47 ded
UGHHHHH SO PERFECT ‼️‼️‼️❣️❣️😍
When Anderson popped back up 🤣
Doja Cat
Popo Smoke
Shawn Mendes
Usher
Nico 8 Vinz
The Weeknd
Usher
Un freaking real. This really proves some people are born to entertain and sing like wow they make it all look so effortless because it’s the most natural thing to them
Ohhhh Bruno, thats my sound & my flow 🥰🤹👍 Sooooo smoooth 😎😁
Nice way of telling a girl she's ho ho ho many street cred
Aka “She Belong to The Streets”
Rip Young Dolph 🐬🐬 Long Live 🐬🐬
When they panned the camera to Anderson on the floor I threw my phone lol 😂
1:34
That’s what happens when you leave the door open
You know u og when 1:37 feels familiar cause you overheard the Uncle say it or lived it yourself.
The song is OK but I don’t like the part when he say this Bitch. I’m not feeling it I don’t care how smooth he think it sounds. 😏
Bro this album is going to go 10×platinum cuz Bruno Mars is a fucking genius trading us back in the day we weren't even born yet n we know this is what is what it must have felt like. ❤️
Finally a song for the fellas for y’all women . Y’all had no scrubs TLC. We got this banger👌🏾🔥
😂😂😂I love it❤️‼️‼️
Russ and bruno Mars next ♥
Waaaaaaoooow
Me : getting high as kite Anderson : (playing dead) Me : bruh Anderson : sike! Me : oh dayum, (continue vibing knowing everything is all right)

So original, something New (...)
Liquor house music lyrics reminiscent of artists like Marvin Sease, Theotis Ealy, or Mel Waiters combined with a smooth 70s groove.  Genius!
This needs Future on the remix 😂🤣😂!
The smoking is kinda silly... but yea of course this song slaps so hard, but that is some cheez they didn't need to include
Lyrics: "Not to be dramatic but I wanna die" Anderson .Paak playing dead: And I took that personally
S/O to Silk Sonic for bringing the classic sound back with a new vibe 😩🤣
Yo! This is gonna be number 1
13k haters? Damn...great song, great video!
I LOVE the old school Jazz they're doing/
They killed this jam!
so good
"Bad ass kids" is a shout-out to Bernie Mac.
this song is skit about a normal man in a relationship and what goes on in the mind
This song does not make me boring, always want to listen like leave the door open
1:44 he needs some milk!
This some classic shit here...
@1:36 every sugardaddy in America right now 😂
I know the words like I help write it 😭😭a banger great moment in music
Anderson paak playing dead was so funny and this song is great
Love this song and production. I've been on the fence with mars. His songs seemed like retro retreads of a by gone era. Here, the contemporary spin he applies is fun to hear and watch. The lyrics are cool not the throwback predictable lyrics on previous songs. Great job.
Not barefoot in the streets😂😂
Bruh absolute banger but soul train called they want there sound back
I should now learn to smoke after hearing this fuckin vibe. It's burning man! 🔥
This song right here, gives me reason to believe that R&B and Soul Music are NOT Dead!!!!!
Agar koi India walon he toh like karo
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Everytime this song comes up on my Playlist I have to replay it at least 10x 😍🤩😅
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This man has some style 😩🔫
Went from catching a grenade to smokin out of the window 🤣
1:33 Directed by Black Dynamite.
"can't believe it!..... i'm in disbelief" 🤣
STOP USING THE "B" WORD!  PUTTING WOMEN IN BAD LIGHT.
Seeing this, Gladys Knight and the Pips come to mind specifically midnight train to Georgia
It's been a few years since I heard your song and the sound really hasn't changed,
If "She belongs to the streets" was a song.
I've been screaming at him falling all day 🤣🤣
her damn kids runnin around my crib like its chucky cheese"  lawd take me now..LMFAO..LMFAO..LMFAO...
New Nostalgia: Looks like a 70s rendition of Bobby Debarge/Bobby Womack/Eddie & Sean Levert 🎶 #LETSGOCHAMP
FIRE!!!!!!
Simplemente una maravilla..!!!
Bruninho se cuida tá vc tá magrinho vê se não trabalha demais e esquece de vc bjs te amo e saúde 😘😘
My girl looking at me like keep playing that song
Quero dançar em cada segundo dessa música gostosa❤️❤️
"SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSMOKING OUT THE WINDOW" OMFG
Aí q música maravilhosa uma som gostoso desse de ouvi vcs são perfeitos ❤️❤️❤️
What the hell did I just watch lmao
Bruno's point and lean when he says "Chuck-E-Cheeeeeze..." Both slide-ins and subsequent "This bitch..." The sway with the cigs in hand... The harmonies... The choreography... The footstomps after "Hercules..." Anderson.Paak passed out on the floor...and the subsequent pop-up, "Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, Benzo..." Anderson.Paak's whole David Ruffin vibe... Bruno's falsetto... The sepia visuals... The lyrics... The fine-assed background singers...  LAWD.  FIRE. ABSOLUTE FIRE.
BONECO WILSON SALVA VIDAS
Simp anthem 2021!!
I guess the door is no longer open. It's bolted shut! 😂😂😂😂
great hit
Fire
The Weeknd and Bruno would make a really dope song nglll
Amo! Pra mim essa música é muito boa. Pra mim que sou uma velha no corpo de uma jovem kkk parei de consumir músicas atuais desde os anos 2000 kkk 💕
brought the 1990's back sheesh
Can't believe I was sleeping on silk Sonic after those commercial god damn this shit is crack 😂
ok BM, retro is played out now, let's step up now...collab with The Weeknd???  Post Malone???  Both? Drake? Breezy?  Or do it yourself, but regenerate bro.
I wish all music was like this bruh
Bruno went from catching grenades for ya to throwing that shit back 😂
PQP, que somzera!!!!!
Not Chuck E. Cheese 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's the fact that he STAYED DEAD for so long 😂
To the 13k people who dislike this beautiful song… I just want to let y’all know  there is special place for in Hell …
Make a girl just wanna say. Oooo weeee!!!
aaaa THE STYLE GUYS, TERRIFIC, THANKS FOR ANOTHER GEM!
d' best add i have from youtube.
K.Ralho. PQP. Que música, meus amigo. Que álbum é esse.
Men, skip single moms they ain't loyal.
I swear this my jam right here.
This song is smooth and funny as hell🤣🤣🤣 I heard Bruno on the radio he said this song was written five years ago💪
Dis, bitch got me paying her rent 😂
TIMING between Bruno and Anderson’s segments unbelievably sooo smoooth. Seamless 🚬🚬🚬 LOVE THIS SONG……..everything about it. Secret Service pose with Bruno and background guys is awesomely delicious….Lmbo 😋🤭😂🔥🤣
Dam man no words  O yea one word ghostface
Don’t date single mothers, this is the message of this song. Red pill
Morí con Anderson en el piso 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
How he go from leave the door open to this b**** got me paying her rent.LOL😭
He ain’t no simp no more
these dudes…are hard as f@ck! this whole album is fire!
Soul train 생각난다 크ㅡ 좋으다!!👍👍👍
Who tf hurt Bruno so damn hard, he made a song that could be summed up by "She belong to the Streets"
Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight, screamin' Hercules!
But you promised you love her the way she is?!
If you guys rewatch "Treasure - Bruno Mars" video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPvuNsRccVw oh you are welcome
What a great aesthetic. They're voices go so perfect together.
Luckly we got them to bring back the best of black music on main stream ❤🙏🏽
This is the moment when a Simp becomes Red Pill... 🤣
I'm loving this ....

One Word : genuinestalistycs
This 💩 is so jive and 🌽🏀 Like an SNL skit parodying the 70’s. If you wanna listen to modern musicians honoring the spirit of 70’s music (and not copying it to a point of caricature like this lame 💩), check out artists like Thundercat (who may have worked with this 🤡show), Sault, Weapon of Choice, Neon Bunny etc.
He never comes out with bad music! Love you sooooo much Bruno❤️❤️❤️❤️This whole album is amazing🔥
Pretty sure atheist 1million of the views was my own🤣
Music has never sounded happier and complete since the birth of Silk Sonic -  A match made in heaven.
Tô viciado nessa música faz dias! 😂😂
wait why is this video so perfect
ya like jazz?
I love this song so much lmao
Muy bueno
Who tf broke Bruno Mars??  What happened to catching a grenade for us 😭  Bro went from dripping in finesse to I just got finessed 💀
This music vid came as an ad and I never even tried to skip it.
This nigga puts out hits than disappears like nothing happened💀
simplemente increíble. 🇦🇷
Bruno has become a parody of himself. Think Elvis. Think Michael Jackson. Think Neil Diamond. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..................
This is the BEST song i've heard in years. So smooth and cool. The video is pure perfection: The 70's vintage RnB/Soul style, the dance moves, the cigarettes, the retro stache, silk suits, everything is perfect here! And the ''Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die'' is so hilarious. I mean, this is funny, cool and great entertaining at the same time all in one song! Haven't seen such greatness in a long time. And the fast ending of the video,  the same as the relationship stopped immediately -  the producer of this video is a f**** genius! I also like the fact, that this song shows, that there are not always men who cheat, but in the modern world even more women. I also love the curse words - they simply have to be in this lyrics! Bruno and Anderson you are GOLD! The Grammy's are yours!
That dance so smooth
This song is 🔥
🔥🔥

And I'm sorry, but that dip that Bruno does at the 'chucky cheese' line is classic. You can feel the 'WTF' in the air. Then Anderson... 'this... b(&*%$... got... me... paying for rent...' makes me crack up every time.
RIP to everyone else at the Grammy's
Epic 💥
Smooth as silk.
Wait a min! I was not ready. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 is this real
This album is 🔥🔥🔥🔥! Sounds like REAL MUSIC is making a comeback. Reminds me of Prince…
esta bien vergas
Soul Train Vibe
lmao someone PLEASE come collect these uncles-in-training
another song, another banger 🙌
I thought I was watching the temptations when I watched this
1:36 - 1:37
This is beautiful and dynamic 😍Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak and the  others you all do it again 👏👏
This video funny as hell!!   I hope your trifling ass out here walking barefoot in these streets!  Hilarious 😂
THIS B*TCH….
This whole album is supersonic!
My ears feel happy
Wow brilliant love it 😍
i thought he belonged to only meee, but I was wronggg, he belongssss..to the streetssss
esse ritmo ficou muito sem graça.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How is it possible to leave a dislike on this video? Gotta be trolling
Listening to this while high 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😌😌😌🔥🔥🔥🔥
😂😂😂I love it
Exeptionnel
Had my head shaking to the beat. And i'm a german! Das gute Musik
This is one of the greatest songs in existence 🤣
If Hoodville did R&B
I have this on repeat. Music arrangement is so great!
I need to hear this
I WOULD LOVE IF BRUNO MARS AND SILK SONIC DROPPED THE ALBUM BEFORE CHRISTMAS PLEAASE
this song is so freaking catchy oml 🔥
They got this off. Love it
Bruno just bringing soul back into music feel like I traveled back in time to the 70s
Song of the year idk why the radio playing it on repeat 🔥🔥🔥
The drummer looks like he could be Bruno's kin folk.
Deberian tener una colaboracion con the black pumas
I love when Anderson paak does a chorus and Bruno comes in and does the same chorus as him and it’s flawless
Now that is old school that's the way music is supposed to be kudos
That ash flick was golden .Paak!! This is the smoothest diss song ever!
1:41
Oran "Juice" Jones is somewhere smiling like a proud uncle
Late 60-70"s Vibe...Loving it !!! :) Great artists
Goddamn so good
No need to comment because everyone’s saying what I’m already thinking 😏🤎
sooooo goood.
Ladies this song is for the men tell that stallion girl to make another for you 😉
This is the best song this year 2021
Got her Bad Ass Kid’s running around my hold crib  like it’s Chunky 🧀
Bruno Mars and Anderson pack make the most greatest music😍😍😍
Brazil🇧🇷💗❤
The first time I heard the "I wanna die" part I couldn't help but laugh
🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:33 Not to be dramatic but i wanna die JUMPING OUT THE WINDOOOOOW
I am crying. This is such a masterpiece
💀 this the most wholesome way of saying she for the streets
If this ain't the best video!! She belongs to everybody.
This song is low key fire.
…but I also hope that yo trifling ass is barefoot out here in these streets..glad I’m not the only one who wishes that in the aftermath!🤣♥️♥️
motown still lives!!!!!!!yes!!!!!!!
0:31
This reminds me of driving in the car with my dad Definitely a two step jam, mad old school vibe love it
Great Song!! Awesome!!
Guy at the back on the right, he missed his steps on Hercules, and I think Anderson missed his steps to sync up on the little skip thing, as Bruno synced up when it was his turn as they all looked cool syncing up, but Anderson was doing something funny and it still looked good. Everybody is going to be doing the hand in the air dance in the clubs, I am sure of that, to this tune, but in saying that, many woman will have an issue with the B word, while still giving Silk Sonic a pass for it, as they love the tune.
Dope
This is freaking amazing! , I love this (And yes Anderson .Paak playing dead made me laugh) hahah
Best to avoid single moms Bruno
1:15 1:15 1:15 1:15 1:15 1:15 BEST PART
This is still trending on music!!❤️
1:01 what a fancy way go to say *she belongs to the streets*
1:00 *she belongs to the streets*
00:59 what a way to say she belongs to the streets
Big tune
Y los hooligans?
💯
I'mma leave the door open ( part 2 )
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Those shoe taps on beat at 1:19 might be the cleanest thing I’ve ever seen
damn yo, I really like this song
I NEVER HAD A SONG HAD ME IN HEARTBREAKING, AND LAUGHER AT THE SAME TIME..MISSION ACCOMPLISHED BRUNO!!!
For some reason they reminded me of the temptations or the 5 heartbeats😂😂
omg!!! sounds so good
PLEASE TURN THIS INTO A VINYL RECORD!! It’s the only thing in the longest time that I think truly deserves it
Besides Anderson’s ‘not to be dramatic but I wanna die’ genius moment, let’s talk about ‘I can’t believe it, I am in disbelief’. This entire song is gold. Not to be dramatic but I can peacefully die now.
empapada
he still on the floor tho lol
Wow
another Bruno mars song, another song added to my playlist instantly
This shit is hilarious and is actually a sing along bop 😆
This what happens when you leave the door open!
Anderson .Paak wasn't dead, but I am.  Such a great song, album, and collaboration.  These guys are a class act.
Everybody needed that Anderson playing dead scene fr 😂
Manjaram demais em assumir o chifre😅😍🥰
Bruno mars you are the best I wish I could see you
They really said bitch you belong to the streets in a classy way tho
2:38: POV you’re in Highschool in the 90’s and you used the bathroom
The group🤝🖤👑
Quem é capaz de dar dislike pra essa música incrível!
Luke 12:35-38 “Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning; And be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the marriage feast, so that they may open to him at once when he comes and knocks. Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes; truly, I say to you, he will gird himself and have them sit at table, and he will come and serve them. If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those servants!”
This entire album is an instant classic!!
Perfeição
2:36 GOTTA GIVE YOU BACK TO THE CITY!!?? YOOO
Music video of the year hands down
every song is a banger!
Bruno eu te amo taaaanto
Give this dudes another grammy please!
This song was well needed from bro...A1 I'm fuckin wit it
Killer harmony and song.
Anderson.Paak is doing musical side quests.
bruno’s highnotes😩
이 영상은 미학적으로 눈이 즐겁습니다 아름다운 것들은 항상 보기 좋습니다
This bish 😄 dude really said he hope she walking around somewhere barefooted 😂🤣
Bruno and Paak  have set the bar high and now I just cant listen to any other songs after playing this
I can picture this song playing on the radio in 1973.
https://youtu.be/PdP841fe1ys
🤘🏽🕶️🤘🏽💉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is wonderful I LOVE how Anderson .Paak pops up from being dead on the floor 🤣 & how he pops is face to sing the chorus when Bruno Mars says I'm in disbelief
Who else was smoking out they window while listening to this?
Umm YAS
You can tell that Anderson doesn't actually smoke but Bruno does lol
this is amazing!
I don't know how many times I've watched this but wow. Like they're moves are so smooth, the voices are beautiful, a perfect amount of humour, the aesthetic and etc. Like it's really awesome. Just wow.
Gonna be a classic fr
i will never let "this, BITCH" go im dying-
damnnn you left the door open and now she got you smoking out of the window
How the fuck YouTube didn't notify me 😭😭I hate you for this
Pop gostoso de se ouvir , isso aí Brasil 🇧🇷🎼
in 360p it's perfect
❤️❤️❤️
that boi died for real , xtra as hell😁
Leave the door open Smokin out of the window The next one , sleepin on the floor 💯✌️
The sugar daddy anthem !!
Love it
Anderson popped up like, "AND ANOTHER THING BITCH!" I am DEEEEAD. My abso favorite part that I can't stop watching.
Hey who is that tall fella singing in the back if them.SHARP!!!!!
The emphasis placed on "Bitch". Felt that. Lol
❤❤❤❤
Man does this music suck
THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE??!! (in my Kat Williams voice).....💣💣💣💥
this song dedicated to me buying merch for BTS hahahaha
Busted out laughing when I saw Anderson on the ground 🤣🤣🤣
Should I take this as serious or a parody of 70's soul.....maybe a little of both?
Them Boyz Too Fly 📈🔥
I was laughing during the whole thing. Great song. Love the Chuck E Cheese line. Completely unexpected and funny.
La escenografía parece del "Show de las estrellas" de Jorge Barón. Los colombianos me entenderán. Bruno y Andersson: GENIOS
This is going to be every scorn males song, their go to anthem. 🎶 This bish got me paying her rent 🎶
Great job to everyone who put this video together. It's so fun to watch!
It's the end when they just started to groove and vibing... They kill it.
Um dos melhores cantores da atualidade
Just a detail folks: I LOVE Anderson .Paak's funky Bobby Womack glasses! Yes, God is in the details. And this video is crammed with nostalgic details. The dance moves are Temptationsly cool. Your heart melts instantly and a grin appears on your face. Mars & .Paak show the greatest respect for the old school tradition and yet add their pinch of humour and urban flavour. The clip's retro atmosphere is spot on and  the organic music is a hell of a throwback to 70s Soul splendour. These dudes have the guts to split the ocean of mediocre mainstream music with pure vintage magic. So effortlessly produced... in the year 2021! Sheer joy!
The Retro moves are killin it!!! Deyum smooth!!!
HE SNAPPED‼️‼️🤣🤣🤣🤣
tbh x1.25 is better than the original tempo
I was 18yrs old, the girl was fine and in my car looking beautiful as we were heading to Jack in the Box.  Back then monster tacos were buy 1 get 1 free.  To my surprise, she ordered 8 monster tacos, so we talking a total of 16 tacos.  We head back to her apartment and she opens the door and I see 6 lil kids.  4 were hers the other 2 were her sister's.  Where was this song in 1988?  We had simp songs like "It's cheaper to keep her" and other foolish songs from simp groups like Boyz to Men and Babyface.  Always Rescue Ronnie for birds, Captain Save'em were tricks and simps.
These two men have revived an entire genre of music that has been missed for far to long. God bless these musical gods
EVERYTHING about this is PLATINUM!!!
오른쪽 키작은 댄서 그루브 질퍽거리는게 아주 색끈하구나
I quit four years ago but this makes me want to take up smoking again. Who wants to live longer anyway?
No paro de escuchar esta canción
Bruninho pago o aluguel da doja cat aí sim 🤠🙌
Why was he still on the floor then pop up like that 😂
this man never misses
Bruno mars is one of the most stylish people ever
what a cheap video,  his label knows that his music flopped, and that he won't sell more than 2,000 copies
This song is my favorite playlist   Yes, you read that right!
they should be a group at this point.. *banger.. after.. banger..*
Super
No entiendo pero me sirve
World Class

i love this
Paak and bruno sound so much alike
The t&b version of she belongs to the streets 😂😂
Omg so smooth my brain's melting out from my ears uggghhhhh
Funny how Mr Bruno started with how beautiful and loving women can be(Just The Way You Are), just to end up calling them bitches and hoes(might as well have), when in all doubt he'll come out as gay before they are finished with him......this world is getting sicker by the minute while people are worried about a shot and so called climate change.

I love how Bruno Mars' lyrics change from being this hopeless lover boy to... something else, I have no idea honestly but the music is still SO GOOD. Never have I heard a terrible song from Bruno.

Yeahhhhhh....talent talent and talent... Thanks for your magical music...from Barcelona .Spain
So much soul in their moves. “I was wrong, she belongeddddd to EVERYONE” 🎶 😂
What a polite way to say she belongs to the streets 😂😩💀😭
The playfulness of the song is what I like the most. "This bitch" is honestly bold. That shit had me rolling when I first heard the song. By far my favorite part to sing.
1:30 Sanji and Zoro relationship with nami
Who knew that Dave Chappell  could sing and have a duet with Bruno?! 😅
出だしの肩！ショルダー！かた！ 肩のノリがやばいやすぎる
Tory lanez doing this type of music too😂😂

Damn the vocals🤩
the posh way of saying 'she belongs to the streets'
i love theses guys !
A bit of nostalgia.
I love this song it’s Hilarious !
Gw liat karna lewat mulu di tiktok 😀
🔥 🎶
I’m just saying if we find out or broke Bruno like this they might disappear because my manz is stressing stresssing
Now this is music. Real vocals by people that can carry a tune without auto-tune and a real band; this reminded me of the good old days.
The only good thing came out because of Covid
This song is really beautiful!
I love this song already🤣
Tell me a time when Bruno Mars ever missed
Damn these mofos made a album full of instant classics
Makasi lo yong rekomn nya wkk
Angas🤘
Dang. To think that Bruno wanted to catch grenades for her back in the day. Now he is smoking out the window. She did him wrong.
me after this song end: *clap clap clap*
Need to lock the door now lmao
Bruh this dude was on the floor dead got up like he's drunk 😂😂🤣
0_0
try it on 0.75 speed and feel the music
When they say  This bitch!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
37M in 12 days craaaaaaaaaaaaaaazy🔥🔥🔥🔥
Silksonic is a reminder that sometimes Rnb needs a little bit of cocaine
This is how I greet all the customers that come into my store 2:21
Nice to go back to 70s Synchronized dance moves nostalgia 🎉
Просто аааагоооооонь!!!, очень круто!
bruno went from catch a grenade for ya to throw a grenade at you
This. Album. Live. 🤩

When Anderson fell to the floor, did everyone saw how cool he was because he still held on to that cigarette. He fell out because that bitch stressed him out
The music, the dance moves it was all so sweet and brilliantly  perform. Above all it was humor with truth to it. Because you do have some bitches out there that will do this crap. In the song he did her right, bye kicking her to the curb.
The feminine urge to be the "bitch" they're talking about in this song
Wow wow wow, this has to be the track of the decade. I've watched this sooooo many times I've lost count. What a masterpiece ❤️
Badass kids running around my crib like it’s Chuck E. Cheese….. 💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:32 took me out 💀💀💀💀
To viciada ja mds
A perfeição meu pai
CARA CE NÃO ERRA NUNCAAA
The shit they're making isn't innovating. They're doing pastiche music,  but they know it works because they have lines of millennials wanting  this stuff. Music is like fashion now only going in circles. We had the  ninetties house revival now it's funk and r&b.
This is the best musical combo of the 2020s!
Smoking out of the window 🚬 🔥🔥👍🏽
Wow!! I love this videoclip!! Bruno Mars is so funny 😍😂
Thank you for mady my day bro.. loving u guys since Childhood  💙 Love from Srilanka 🇱🇰 🌎 ❤
Hercules hercules hercules 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Genius 🤣
my man laying on floor, mutha fukin priceless
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die" might be the line of 2021.
ayoooo leggoooo
Polite way of saying “she belongs to the streets”
I'm so happy Bruno Mars is bringing funk back to some of the mainstream.
When that shot of Anderson on the floor hits, I'm dying 😆🤣🤣
That was SUPER BAD. Gone Paak, Gone Bruno!!!!
*CHILLS!*
https://youtu.be/vD4HRutEmaw
So campy...I LOVE it!!!
OLDSCHOOL VYBE VS NEWSCHOOL VYBE COMBINEDLOVE IT,. BRUNO MARS PLS DONT GET OLD.... WE NEED YOU
Smokin is bad 4 you !!!
great song!
this reminds me of my dad when he's freshly out of college; but it's dad who belongs to everybody
1:52
Who hurt my manz
I don't know why I keep laughing watching this 😂
El mensaje es claro, "fumar mata".. Pero de algo hay que morir,   "Hee Hee!",
The only complaint about this is that it is too short - it should last all day long.  Superb old skool 👌
The harmonies
Its Bruno Mars and The Pips! DOPE AF SWANKER THAN A TANKER IN A  MOMMAS BEATR!!!
Woke up on 7 am, went on discord, checked youtube and said, “I might be high but did Bruno Mars release an album”
I’m obsessed
shiiiiittt!! ooops sorry hahahaha! I can't help it. Bruno and Anderson never fail to deliver a solid jam!
This is my neighbor's favorite song......whether he likes it or not.
1:43 Omg i laughing 😭💔
Dayum...You either go Motown or get mowed down⚰
2:00-2:20 is the most epic part of this absolute masterpiece!🤩
This is so great.
Clean
Anderson is a fantastic drummer, but seeing Bruno's brother E-panda on this MV somehow makes me happy.
BRO FERDINAND MARCOS AND MARCOS FAMILY IS CORRUPT
2:03 how did they master the dance move from TWICE The Feels???
The music is too good to be a sob story about the simp lifestyle, which it is.
Where's silk sonic YouTube channel 🤔
Dig
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Awesome song. Love it.
While anderson paak is playing dead, i remembered ninoy aquino's  photo playing dead at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA)
this so BOP
I've seen a lot of acts from Sinatra to Elvis, Tom Jones, Temptations, MJ, Prince ... I've NEVER seen a MF pull that drop dead move like AP did. Finally, something ORIGINAL.  Equally hilarious and brilliant. This perfectly straddles the lines between parody and homage and nails both.  At last, I'm a Bruno Mars fan.
All the love you have for a person and this  how the end be
This shit is real talk
You gotta pay attention to what’s being said tho. It’s too too real lol .
such a polite way to say  "she belong to the street"
its funny how Anderson. Paak when he was playing dead but then he came back upi in like 0.33333 seconds
It's so sad people think everyone that sound good has autotune
Seriously how could she do this to you?!?!?😩
I can smell award for this album
Listen... my grandma asked me who sung this and said she don't remember this band. Nobody say anything, if anyone ask this song came out in the 70's
0:54 Anderson Paak's "How could she do this to me" is literally orgasmic. man fuck that shit was smooth
Can never listen to this on Spotify, feels like a crime not to watch the video while the song plays.
just like that, he just created another masterpiece. wtf
Music for oldpeople 🤭🤭🤭🤭
Ain't let go of that cigarette not once, not none of 'em
Anderson Paak just pulled a Yamcha.
Bruno mars is better singer.
Bruno was channeling his inner Ike Turner with those hand gestures 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best ad I ever got
the song, the choreography, the aesthetic, anderson's "I wanna die" part, the cigarettes held by everyone including the back up dancers. this is awesome.
NOT TO BE DRAMATIC BUT I WANNA DIEEEE~
Jamming to this song 🎶
Travis Scott be like :  1:44
_These dudes are questioning their Simping status in their respective relationships. Good for them._
When he said "this bitch" I felt that.
DAMN.
"I hope that you get everything that you need. I also hope your triflin' ass is walkin' around barefoot in these streets." I need this on a tshirt.
Bruno ain’t catching no more grenades for ya
This song is going to be our she belongs to the streets anthem wait and see people going to be playing this song 20Year's  from now with a girl do the wrong by them
So this is the 70's way of saying " she belongs to the streets"
4:21
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
when you literally die on carpet: 1:44
I think Bruno Mars is the closest thing we'll get to understand how Millennials see Michael Jackson and just how proud they are when seeing him conquering the world with his music
This is the last song I hear on my iPhone 8 this is the funeral song for my phone thanks for the memory’s I will always love this phone my first phone the day I got it after my 5th grade graduation and now you have to leave me like this I will always love you and be sad 😭
Those notes that Anderson hits at 2:08 are so good and fitting. I know this song is supposed to have a comedic vibe but it also has a kind of emotional vibe that only these two guys could create and be taken seriously with. Seriously freaking love this song.
NENOY AQUINO REFERENCE
Alternative music video pleaseeeeee
This is just a cash grab “soul” album. Lol not bad, but come on now lol
🎯💯🎯💯🎯💯🎯💯🎯💯
This is the best, most elaborate way to call someone a hoe
Karmesha's theme song 🤣✌😭
What a performance... pretty sure Bruno re-incarnated from one of the Temptations. Not that they were in my era, but a nice flow with meaning (not to mention how chill he is) Kudos to Anderson Paak and co...
PS. Baby don't waste those sexy ass vocal cords on those cigs!!!;) Oh f it smoke if it makes you happy! I smoke but I don't sound like you either;)
36 million views 12 days !? Get it guys! Love you Bruno!❤️ 4ever!!

Bruno mars went from beautiful girls to b*tch regarding women...
Bruno really went from “I’d catch a grenade for ya” to “Ima throw it back”

That grapevine crew done dried up and turned to bitter Raisins !
Where am I do not smoke Bruno Mars do not smoke it's bad is that chocolate or is that real Andrea.
2:50  Justin Timberlake
Perfeito 🤎
2 Esdras 8:1-6  “And he answered me, saying, The most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come for few.” I will tell thee a similitude, Esdras; As when thou askest the earth, it shall say unto thee, that it giveth much mould whereof earthen vessels are made, but little dust that gold cometh of: even so is the course of this present world. There be many created, but few shall be saved. So answered I and said, Swallow then down, O my soul, understanding, and devour wisdom. For thou hast agreed to give ear, and art willing to prophesy: for thou hast no longer space than only to live. O Lord, if thou suffer not thy servant, that we may pray before thee, and thou give us seed unto our heart, and culture to our understanding, that there may come fruit of it; how shall each man live that is corrupt, who beareth the place of a man?
The coordination and lighting affects on the Hercules are so fucking awesome
I’d be blasting the shit outta this song in my time machine.
its really to see evryone on the group just recognized..
Chillin' but slayin'
This is everything it's just aaaah

I love Anderson Paak.
Grandissimi e bellissimi😍
0:32
nadie como Bruno Mars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mannn - I love it! Just can't turn a hoe into a housewife. Shit ain't change. Go ask grandpa.
She's for the streets.
The 12k dislikes probably thought dis I like
Bruno is definitely channeling the 70's...out here looking like Sammy Davis Jr.

https://youtu.be/6gTbEFvJ2dY
Bruno went from catching grenades to throwing that shit back
Like this song
0.32 😂😂 bruhhhh
This song is so refreshing
Although I'm young I still love listening to the old music. There couldn't be a better group to bring those vibes back!
This song is amazing
1 second after post nut clarity kicks in:
Smoking out the windows
oq ela fez com nosso bruninho
See you after 5 years
Album of the year.. hands down
When Anderson first popped in with “This. Bitch.” I had to keep replaying it it was so funny lmao 😂
Another favorite song while taking a shower✨
0:30 when she says she don't want nothing to eat then steals your fries.
Dave Chappell  This reminds me of him Love it 😀
I am here after Taeyong's bubble. Dude, it is awesome. Paak's dramatic die is culmination. Thank you for sharing it in you bubble.
Is Bruno playing drums too. 😳
obgda pessoa q fez o Bruno pagar td pra ti, o mundo te ama!
Got that big Motown sound
1:36-1:47 is such a MOOD
This song is so so golden
no but when they zoomed out and he was on the floor I fucking lost it
I can’t believe mainstream audiences are only finding about Anderson Paak now
LOL this is song is catchy!
o anderson no chão KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
No se que clase de droga le pusieron a esta canción lo único que se es que me volví adicta
Bruno with the cigarette in his hand like this bitch stressed him tf out🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruno went from “jump in front of a train for you” and went to “bitch I’m Savin my self”
Smoking is back at it agaaaaaaaain
Bruno went from “I’ll catch a grande for you” to “throw a grande at you”
It's the pop up after playing dead for me 🤣🤣
Issa vibe🖤😎😌
Listening to this every shower😮‍💨👌🏼

You guys left the door open for  her ,then she skate  to the crib after that she had you smoking out the window wow so haven't had time yet to hear the whole album yet but it's a professional old school performance this what Micheal Jackson was saying to me in Billie Jean but in a different way.Love you guys.

Giving Oldhead vibes 🤣 i love it
Easter Egg Alert:  AP lowkey got the GOAT  tatted on em.   Just made a great video even better.
All beliefs that are formed from doubts should be thrown out the window. Everything worth keeping is worth developing with spiritual intentions.
My LOVE to you,  Bruno ❤️❤️❤️❤️ From EGYPT 🇪🇬🇪🇬
They dropped the B word so hard I laugh every single time!! I know they spit every time!! lmao!!!
Wow! 🔥🔥🔥

They are a great duo i love this

The way he just layed on the floor then got back up to say "smoking out the window" 💀💀
How do they blend comedy/soul/melody/production like this? Anyone else doing this would come off fake and these guys out here making music that would have gone double platinum in the 70s
I was like babe look at this....this b6758 got me....😆😆😆😍
I just love the intensity on the word bitch from Bruno 😂👏👍😎
Anderson Paak said Lawd Jesus no, lawwwd Jesus no!😂
This bihh  got me paying the rent paying for trips diamond's on her neck diamonds on her wrists and her I am all alone lol 😆 🔥
Looks like treasure
okay who broke their hearts
second best song of 2021👌
Calling a women "Bitch" publicly on a song. Sorry Bruno I can't appreciate that.
These videos seem like they're having so much  fun  making them .
PJ Theme song

🤣🤣🤣❤❤❤❤
Sounds a bit like 'Feels Like Summer'
This song knocks
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Got her kids running around my crib like it’s Chuckie Cheese!  Lol !  Love this one!
I never listen to new stuff, I'm old school and thats what I listen to.  But, I dig the 70's vibe and this is not bad....

Listening thinking about what roy wood Jr said... 😆
"this bitch got me paying the rent" & him laying on the floor. thats gold for me

You shouldn't of left that damn door open!!!! See stop serving filets and start serving Lays!
This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through these hard times, thank god for music! I love you  💖
THE ONLY WAY IMA TRIP OVER A BITCH IS IF SHE'S SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR
They are building a entire house. First Leaving de DOOR open, now Smokin out the WINDOW, then what? Crying at the ROOF?
increible
🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
Only Silk Sonic can successfully reanimate an era none of them have lived through.
Taeyong said he recommends this song when I'm down, so I'm here.it really makes me want to dance, yoksii ty track💚💚
💜
not a big fan of bruno but this music vid slaps 🤣
The cigarette flick on the snare got me where I can't breathe 😂
they should collab with eminem . only for how passionate they are about music and how i feel they can also relate musically , like bruno with music , em is with rap .
This song is my all-time mood, God bless the day Anderson and Bruno were bon.
Oh I thought she belonged to only me but, I was wrong cause she belongs to Onlyfans 💔😭
I'm gonna say it again imagine back in the day they had the audacity to ever question if Bruno could handle the superbowl. Tuh! Huhuh! 😏 At this point he's just playing with us.
Genius!! Smooth, hilarious, entertaining, sonic perfection, the vocals, the dancing, the baddest band in the land, the visuals the 'silk sonic' as a collab is on point as usual. I love how they haven't compromised the quality of their musicianship or pen at all, but they don't take themselves to seriously either. 'Best out there bar none' is a valid statement at this point. Maybe some they're equal to 'the best' but there's def none better.
0:57
Man’s went from “I’ll catch a grenade for you” to “THIS BITCH!” Lmaooooo
2:43 nobody does this anymore

Awesome to hear Bruno Mars again
Bruno went from "I'll catch a grenade for you" to "I'm throwing that grenade at you."   Damn, which one of you fucked him up like that?
Absolute master piece!!!
اللي سمعها من ليل ايزي لايك
Speechless. No words. Too good for me.
I don’t know if it’s just me but why does it say 11 days ago?
🔥🤘🏽🔥🤘🏽🔥🤘🏽🔥🤘🏽🔥🤘🏽🔥

This is amazing 👏🙌😍
The cigarette never ends
This song is on another level
Girl it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me ❤️
Went from catching grenades to "THIS BITCH GOT ME.... SMOKIN OUT THE WINDOW" 😂😭❤🔥

For the folks that thumb this video down. Your ears are trash😒... This 70's music and video is a straight BANGER!! 💕
1:50 Get This Reff On TikTok

the camera quality should've been filtered to look like something from that decade of music
You know who needs to be on the remix?  Will smith.
1:47 Anderson bro, you ok? 😆
hi pls let Jazmine sulivan on this to do a female part with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

나는 호구로소이다. ㅋ
I'm here because Taeyong recommended this song, yeahh not bad every your song is masterpieces
time travel to the good 70's [the benzo?] high notes, killer drumming, the muppet's show humor 1:51 etc
Damn, Bruno was the good guy, can't imagine who hurt him like that.
Taeyong said he is shaking, dancing his ass off in a funny way while listening to this.   I'm doing it right now too. 😂
Taeyong sent me
Just amazing. Hugs from Mozambique-Africa

Kesini garagara Taeyong:))
I'm one of the people who came because of Lee Taeyong
Just a fancy way of saying "She belong to the streets.." lmaoo
kata ty kalo lagi sedih dengerin ini sambil goyang goyang ahaha
Bruno Mars: I’ll catch a grena-… you know what, fuck that
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
She belongs to the streets type song
Who broke my nigga heart man

1:23 - 1:26 I SWEAR Dancing moves on point 🔥🔥
How could she do this to me?..
YO! Somebody time capsule this thing RIGHT NOW because this song just became the musical thesis for our time.
The  "she's for the streets" classic. Amankazana 🙆🏽‍♂️

COLD BLOODED !!!  👍. YEP.  THE BABY-BOOMER SAID IT. 😂.  It's Real.  "Smokin out the window". Everybody had some of those days.  I can't do nothing but laugh at it now.  When he fell on that floor !!!  That was it for me.  Genius. The lyrics. Everything.  Keep it up.  You found the formula. NEVER change the formula.  Smokin.

1:44 you're a Filipino if you know something else just like Anderson Paak's pose
Yoooooo this shid is dope this is real singing harmonizin like a mugg.

Now we just need a track with silk sonic and thundercat
Must have played this song  35, 45 thousand times today. The best R&B Duo of all time. I swear....love Silk Sonic...this generation doesn't deserve this amount of musical greatness
Bruno is slowly morphing into Sammy Davis Jr.
I'm so glad there is people still makeing good ass music ❤❤❤
I like the song, but wish they would stop with the B word. We tear down each other too much.
Got me a new fav.
Broooo where's the vinyl release ??????
Just give them their Grammy now
Yeee
so good!!
That was good
This song is up there with Hall and Oates “She’s Gone”.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
The fact this aint trending #1 is shocking to me
Bangesss!!
THIS IS THE BEST SONG IVE EVER HEARD
Red pills 💊
absolutely magnificent!!! ❤️🙌
This looks like a cigarette comercial...
Anderson .Paak is comedy central! But I am here for it #PaakNation
This shit is dope classic
Bruno, you're amazing just the way you are but please eat a cupcake with a cherry on top for me <3
Their action reminds me of end of the road from boyz2men
Wow! Nobody noticed that he talked about a single mother he chose to be with…..all other songs of  love making and disappointed he never called a girl a bitch! Why this song? Kids treating his house like Chuck E. Cheese ?
Best song 🎧
Put him in a jam and the ex was in UFC... damn!!! 😂🤣😂 that cig swing tho lol 0:24 he was pissed the ole school way. I love it!
🛹

You'll notice some approaches to get rid of this issue that work quicker than others, by go'ogling Mario Volpstein, you can read a little more about one of these methods, and understand the reason why some types of vitamins might not be working for you.

I'm in luv with this song
Beluga approved :D
The way Anderson.Paak plays dead and comes out from nowhere killed it😂 1:44 "Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die"
bro Bruno Mars went from Catching grenades for ya, to Throwing Grenades at ya.
1:51 I actually got a jump scare 🤣🤣💀
This song is basically "she belongs in the streets" in ballad form
Beautiful
Hello
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🤣🤣🤣💀Great lyrics. Real sh!+
Essa dupla acaba comigo!
The Simp Anthem

Sunday long drive mellow music....
Lol you know how many teenagers decided to pick up their first cigarette after this?! 😭😂
Love the fact that they came together
WHERE THE HOODVILLE FAM AT
Bruno Came Thru Like Eddie Kane Jr on tht second half...this is the jam tho
This song is funny asf you never seen Bruno get loose like this, he done ran into a trifling chick   - It happens sometimes  - Them type of girls bring the worst out you stay away from them

Love how the choreography low key reminds me of Treasure by Bruno Mars yet the storyline is totally different. 🙂
Name one bad song from Bruno man
I love that if sounds so genuine and reminds me of the like 70s soul and jazz, but its also goofy and dramatic as hell
BRUNO TE AMOOOOOO.

Da Baby Shows Off New Baby With Dani Leigh! 😱  https://youtube.com/shorts/YXT_EZ7sS2c?feature=share

Anderson.Paak meeting Bruno Mars is the best thing to happen for music!
This is a classic.
Absolutely love the song Hate the lyrics
I can‘t get over the choreographie, man. Watching the video again and again
Coldest shit ever
Imagine Bruno and The Weeknd on the same track
amazing song!!!!!
ndyabawe derrick ifyou ever see this comment just know , we both laughted to that part when Anderson played dead after saying "not being dramatic but i wanna die "
Bruno mars and Anderson paak are brilliant artists…I love the old souls in them because they know to incorporate it with the new school sound….
Thats what happens wen you leave the the door open #$#
A esas 12k nmg que pedo? Jajajajajajaja
Good
0:33 Paak with the cigar flick after bitch......ooooo I felt that
This is a nice way of saying he went fishing on the streets for love and came back fleeced. Sucks when it happens for sure.
"EPIC" My homie died. Then came back... watching him laying on the ground tho not moving. Killed me too. Silk Sonic best group ever...
Thoughts and prayers for Bruno. Am I the only one that see's his MSA/Atrophy. Bruno you are a great great singer. I hope for the best.
I’m so happy that Anderson Paak is gaining more fans/supporters as well due to this collab been a long time fan/supporter and I just love to see it
This is classic yet funny at the same time
Him? Yes it is.
The entire album 🔥🤍♾
Where is dillon oliphant
🎶.....THIS....B**CH....GOT ME... 🎶
This outfit is the best thing since all those awesome 70,s soul bands.... its simply fantastic ! best thing in 40 odd years !
If you don’t say anything,some people will swear this song is actually from the 70s. Great Jam!!!!!!!
Since when Bruno got so bitter about women ? Like dude calm this toxic masculinity of you down for fuck sake... Such a disappointment
the start is the best part change my mind
The swagger is excessive, and I love it
I belong to everybody.  Im a CMT lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣
He ain't wanna be dramatic,  but did the most dramatic death since ricky from boys in the hood... loved it
Masterpiece of the highest order
how can you synchronize a dance so perfectly, they move like a swiss clock.
I wish this came out before Halloween, I would've showed up to the costume party as a Silk Sonic backup singer. lol
Love the old school vibes
Naw, this video is super simple but they crushed it
Nobody:  My brain: Not to be dramatic but I wanna dieeeee
Great!!
That chucky cheese line kills me man,  cause all i can picture is my 3 boys when there were really young just running through my house wrecking the place.
I never thought Bruno Mars of all people would put out such a based song. Respect.
At the end yall will be after her again ,thats love darling 😏🎮
Anderson Paak still laying on that floor 3 weeks later....🤣😭🤣
Please, just keep them coming!
Hello. So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is. I am not trying to force my belief down people's throats. It's your choice whether you want to accept it.   So, a question: Do you think you are a good person? If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, watched adult material? All of those are sins and anyone who sinned is not good(on God's standard). You, I and most( most because babies don't sin, and maybe specifically mentally Ill people) purely human beings have violated God's moral law. Since God is just, He can't let sin go just like that.   So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned.   The reason why blood must be spilled for forgiveness of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the sacrifice of animals were enough to temporarily cover some sins. (it did not allow forgiveness of sins, Unlike Jesus's, it only temporarily covered them). Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. Jesus was buried and rose again. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus's spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our Salvation. And then your sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved.      See:  Romans 3:10 KJV, Romans 3:23 KJV, Romans 5:12 KJV, Romans 6:23 KJV, Romans 5:8-9 KJV Romans 10:9-10 KJV, Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV, John 3:16 KJV, Leviticus 17:11 KJV,  Ephesians 1:7 KJV, Colossians 1:20 KJV, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 KJV. https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g              Evidence for God's existence: Kalam Cosmological argument, Contigency argument, Modal ontological argument.  Regarding Christianity watch InspiringPhilosophy's videos about the Ressurection of Jesus reliability of NT. Together, they show good evidence that Christianity is true.

1:47: Me when someone says andy's coming
dice mi chica que quiere todo contigo!
If the music quality was less than out of this world this would be a Chappelle show parody....
their voice complements each other...one of the best duo in this RNB jam.
Paak got me screaming hercules when stepping 5 times on that floor...
Anderson : "Not to be dramatic" Also Anderson : *Fucking dies*
Truthly a masterpiece
my love<3
I love everything about this album, this song, this video - it's nostalgic of all of the motown and blues I listened to as a kid.  I hope more music comes out like this!
The brothas have never sounded this bitter. The girl/s really did a number on them. Anderson doesn't only sound bitter but petty as well.😂🤣
OH NOOOOO!!! WHOA WHOA!! I felt that ish lol
Im in love
Anderson paak literally stuck his face infront of the camera to say those lines😭❤
This shit will make a gangsta fold, they speaking straight facts 🔥🔥
These bros are now red pill crooners
😍
So they bring back what we all can't  experience anymore and that is such a music from 70s, 80s(?) to now. This is what it used to be called a real good music
Paak: not to be dramatic Also Paak: dies on the floor and pops back up
Amazing song! But DAMN are we gonna have a whole wave of people picking up smoking! 😂 They just make it look way too cool. I now feel this need to hold a cigaret between my fingers when I listen to this song 🤷🏽‍♀️
Nostalgique 💚 J'aime bien ça me rappel mon enfance 🤩
mhmm
He found out that it was just his turn that's all.   She belongs to the streets.
Anderson doing too much here. XD Poping back up like a gangster after playing dead kills me!
They dont miss got damn ahahaha
This song gives me child support vibes
🤔
Anderson just sliding into frame with "THIS. BITCH."  kills me
This man is awesome
this song had me crying laughing😂😂😂
So, is Bruno Mars mixed with Aeta?
damn those moves
Yeah he tired. He been trying for her and just gave up now. Who put the straw that broke the camel's back? Who hurt him?
😆 🤣 😂...this song smh...
Real music. .....whattttt. it's been too long since I heard actual music
*ending up here after listening to doja cat’s aint shit * Me: 👁👄👁
Instant classic…. Love it and will be played regularly at my roller skating rinks.
they put their final breaths in this song bro
Yo I’m playing this alllllll winter 😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

This feels more like Christmas than Mariah Carey.
Y’all let’s keep on streaming this song. This deserves it.
WHAT IS THIS ! WHAT SURPRISE 70´S
sorry fellas you got got
This bitch got me paying her rent 😂
1:51
From the streets she was born and from the streets she shall die! Us men, we all stand insolidarity under one God, and we all make an oath, a covenant that we shall only marry virgins and shall fuck fuck and disregard Any woman that has been touched by another man.  what say ye? Can I get a witness!? Let every woman who is not a Virgin or a widow die alone without a man or children! Lmao
I'm starting to wonder, is this song about ...
Back to 80s in 20s🔥🖤🥀
Still referring to females disrespectfully. Why not refer to this "women" or this "girl" or this "female".
Can we please have more of this group of men??? My gosh they sound so frikking good I want to listen to them all day long, I already liked them in "Leave the door open" they together sound soooooo good ❤

Harmonies are tight! Lyrics Hillarious.  Performance had me ☠. Love it tho lol
Switch the quality to 360p for that nostalgia feel
God damn
Bruno Mars is a blessing I love how he has that old school vibe
:D:D:D
I love this Motown inspired duo... It reminds me of Commodores and The Temptations - my dad plays all their music. It's perfection! I've always loved how they sounded back in the day and Bruno and Anderson captured just that 💕👌🏽
https://youtu.be/4MZ9iQPyFMM
1:19-1:36 Anderson snapped with them vocals
His every subscriber has watched this song now😗
why does bruno look like that? is he sick?
I honestly don’t understand how they got even one good take for this video after Anderson dramatically fell and Bruno rolled in 🤣🤣
Got me out here buying cigarettes and I don't even smoke 😭
Not to be dramatic but i wanna die😂😂😭
Woozi I know you're watching this for the hundredth time today, I got you boy

Cheat Codes 🔥💯
Yeßs
Just the perfect tag team!
Silk Sonic belongs to world's history <333
Who hurt my mans
I wanna have 45 kids to this song
This is straight FIRE. Everyone stepped up to the plate for this. Bruno, Paak, the session musicians, producer...EVERYONE! And it's not some lousy attempt at a retro style song. It feels period appropriate. I almost got caught off guard on this one.
Idk who keeps hurting Bruno but at this point I and praying on the downfall of his love life
Bruno and Anderson and silk sonic are soooo good togetherrrrr who agrees?
Simp behavior detected 😭😂
soul music at its finest
Just WOW  🤯👌
Love this song absolutely beautiful
Speechless! Magic every time.
Basically what they are saying is she belongs to the streets with a tender whimsical melody
I love the dance ❤️❤️❤️
1:59 thank me later
Gives me that nostalgia I never had 😫
This bitch! Got me cold! Lmao
So no one is gonna talk about how bruno is on the drum and singing at the same time?
❤️❤️❤️
This played as an ad while I was watching a video, watched it until the end and now I'm here

When you realize that EVERY part of the song is “that best part” you keep replaying to hear again.          Bootzilla, blaster of the universe
It’s the cigarettes kmsl
YouTube gave me this as an ad, today was a good day.
Banger
Bruno mars having the i have apple-pen vibes. 😆😆😆
This the new “Walking in The Rain”. 🤣🤣🤣
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I've played this video back to back laughing
Need future on the remix she belongs to everybody instant hood classic
The way I HOLLERED when Anderson sprang back up
Bruno se esta encargando de mantener el espiritu de esas epocas vivo en cada video y cancion que hace, genial
So fuckin cool.
I cant stop laughing  this song is funny  as heck 🤣🤣🤣 he said this bitch got her bad ass kids running around his whole crib like it's Chuck E  Cheese 🤣🤣 I am screaming Bruno 🤣🤣🤣💯
Quiero un cigarro de esos que tiene Bruno, le duró todo el MV y ni se consumió OIVISNDSD
Fellas we finally have a anthem we can all relate to.
Their skills vocals are not a joke. Really enjoy the end of the music my best part ❤️❤️❤️
Everything about this video is just perfect!
Smoking kills, gentleman
Just love how Bruno ain't a SIMP anymore
This has got to be the best song about being a simp ever produced.
Im wondering how they did this video and not cracking up
blame me for the last 1M views
They should do a remix with future lmao😂
I've watched this countless times now and every time I see Anderson just lyin there on the ground I laugh out loud.
1:36 your welcome
Funky, groovy, and a kewl vibe too, so 70's retro, only thing to say .... I DIG IT !!!
Anderson Paak better stop playing….giving me ideas for that big ass mouth of his 😉😉😭😭😘
Never in my life have i heard grown men sing in such beautiful harmony and soul about their ex-girlfriend being a slut for the streets. Brought tears to me eyes. If she is for the streets u gotta let her go. Even if u love her, she won't change, let her go (so i guy like me can have my turn 😁😆😄).
THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN AAARH
Chuckie Cheese 🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀 Lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So Classic with elegance.

0:32 When Anderson popped up in the camera saying "Dis bitch" talking with the cigarette, I felt that.
This was on an ad, and I'm happy it showed up
No word to describe how much I'm in love with this album.This whole album is a masterpiece. The bestttttt duo ever

Slick as fuck 💯
When celebrities are RP you know things are bad.... Even they are fed up...
Amo
Bruno looks slim, fit. He never fails to disappoint. This song, video is reminiscent of the 60s and 70s Motown groups like the Stylistics and others. Love this!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
Bruno Mars Feat Anitta vídeoclip 💥😜✌️🎶
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Never disappoint
I love it!😁😁
That's why.. don't let the door open😌
Who ever made the beat thankyou its soo gooood
I have to say who ever been hurt by their ex can relate to this song. Don't matter if your a female or male. We all have been in this spot and that's why this song is getting alot of love. If you get mad because of a certain lyric then you must be the one who is cheating and this song makes you feel guilty.
This song goes to all the 4th street hoes and around the globe
Damn, who hurt these dudes
How much money did the tobacco lobby pay for this song and video?

Rasputin when killed colorized: 1:36   Rasputin after being killed colorized: 1:52
Smoother than butter on a fresh plate of hotcakes!
Bruno Mars got me 🤣🤣🤣with the "got her bad ass kids running around my whole crib like it's Chuck E' Cheese" part. 🤣🤣🤣
They are so talented and together it’s just beautiful. 🙌🏾😩
The music is good.
Smoking is bad. You know this. Stop advertising it like it's OK.
This song makes my head full of music
*THIS* is R&B!
Bruno went from “I’ll catch a grenade for you” to “bitch catch it yourself”
should've said she belongs to the streets.
I love the way Anderson was playing dead lmfao
Bruno 😍❤️🇵🇭
This shit be smooth as fuck
I don’t really follow modern music much these days but I’ve heard people talking about Silk Sonic and wow it’s amazing. Definitely worth the hype! This song is gonna be stuck in my head all day now haha.
idk why i clicked on this.  I thought it was some old school stuff.  Turns out it was some dumb shit.  Who is this clown?  not gonna Google him.
Anderson pull up an eric andre shi
I keep thinking of The rock, and Kevin Hart in their clothing lyp-syncing to this song. I gotta see it
Woohoo...i like this song more than i like it
Bruno mars is like tatlor swift popping out every 3 -4  months  bringing out .. songs of  centuries  then  going hybernate  👼😏
🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭👍👍👍👍🤫🤫🏍️🏍️🏵️🏵️🎖️🏅
this song is so ironically oxymoronic - the swift, smooth beat just flows through your head when really the lyrics are a whole different song! Mark of talent right there!
Fantástico!!!!! Top Top Top Top Top.......
Goddamn my dudes are bringing sexy back in retro style!
City girls punching air right now
This is gonna be another timeless classic by Bruno and Paak. Easily my favorite off the album
01:35
👍🏼😘
Love this. You know her.
Keeping it on loop!!! FIRE!!!!🙌
I should smoke already cause every smoker I know is god damn singer.
Best song while smoking out the window
This whole album is such a masterpiece. No bad songs in it.
I f looovvvvveeee it, damn these boys!!! are killin' it !
Machucaram o Bruninho
most polite way to say, "she belongs to the street."
Seriously, I want to know who's the chick who screams "Hercules" during sex. AND her phone number too, if it ain't too much. Asking for a friend ;)
These lyrics are hilarous good vibes
No one got any use of me Use me as a dislike button
The emphasis on the 'B' word by Bruno 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I will pay for the first seat in the super bowl if this two are going to perform in the live stage 🤩 this is fire 🔥
This is good stuff better than marijuana
Meanwhile that guy said ”she take my dinero”
Thanks brother's for keeping that R&B groove going 👌👌👌👌👌👌
It was my birthday
what happened with Bruno Mrs?
The link  below explains why different bad habits & unhealthy lifestyle example smoking is not good for your brain-it causes memory loss -its very informative-if any one has relationship issues then they should not resort to smoking, etc.    link=   https://youtu.be/XtzZMRgz8IQ
From "cathin granade for you" to ....
WOW AMAZING

This music video is amazing!
incrível
When we catch our kids listening to this song twenty years from now, we'll be sayin' : "what ya'll know know about this".
The whole song is one level ... And the moves are other level ..  And specially the one while 'sitting on the knee' saying 'Ooooh'.It is so like butter ... Very smooth
Yes for Music !
I can see snoopdogg making a remix of this song
Bitch got him smoking out the window ...paying rent cooking an shit
He belong to everybody 🧖🧑‍🦱
Sexiest man alive
😂😂😂 Bruno went from ima leave the door wide open to ima lock that mfin door
Just wondering if you are looking for a new talent, “Kieran Aine”. Got good music you might like.
wow its just too much i love it
💋💋💋💋💋💋  🌬🌬🌬🌬
Nah but why did Bruno put so much emphasis on THIS BItCH
The most silky, groovy and classy "She belong to the streets.." song ever!!
Love the 70's vibe, the melody is tight and the vocals are top quality. Buuuuuuuuut.......... even though it's real stuff being sung on, I prefer less hostility in my music. I didn't like it in the late 90's and 00's when there was just one man-hating track after another being released, so can't ship this without being a hypocrite. I guess it has it's time and place though, just not in my happily married home.
I did a compatibility thing on the pattern  with Bruno and it said "life changing" "rare" still has me intrigued. The world may never know?
From to jumping  on a grenade  to this  He's  definitely grown-up
Noice song
predicting the grammy
I was scared that we'd lose the real Anderson Paak if he went mainstream. When I saw him on the floor actin a damn fool I was relieved 😂 #breezylovejoy4eva
🔥🔥🔥
How is nobody talking about the nutty professor reference with the "Hercules, hercules"? 😂
I feel like this is what it would have been like if Prince and Michael Jackson ever actually collaborated.
노래 넘나 좋은것~
How THE FUCK can u dislike a piece of golden art like this
Sounds like something Raphael Saadiq did better almost 20 years ago. Not to mention the original purveyors of the same style. Of course it sounds (and looks) good, it's Mars and Paak but...
Pamulinawen: ❎ Smokin out the window: ✅
Bruno Mars really gets what he wanted now about his music please keep this style of music
Absolutely fabulous!
I think he got tired of catching grenades
She belong to everybody = she belong to the streets ……song so good, got single moms singing along 😂😂
“This Bitch got me paying the rent” Feeling this one 🙌😂
Finally people recognizing .paak and his COLD ASS GAME
Get it!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💜💜💜💜
the sad lyrics is sad ofc the melody is like golden
Anderson just randomly pops up everywhere, you never know where he's coming from lol
I've been shouting "THiS BiTCH" around my house for days now. I think my parents are getting concerned.

At 1:35 when he died, I did 2. 😆😂🤣
100% Talent and Music!
I remember when this came out, back in 1974...
Seriously great. Perfect.
accidentaly listening to this with 1.5x speed AND?!?!?! SUCH A GIFT TO MY EARS
These cats bought that 70s sound to the year of 2021. Kudos!
Wowwww
Paak got me dying boi 😂😂
I have a friend of my that he hates me right now because this song is word for word him and his ex girl! So i be blasting this song as soon as i see him lmfao
I am in LOVE with this hahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is "she for the streets" but smooth
LEGEND.
This is the #1 video on YouTube these guys so creative
They can record a hit and make it sound like a classic now that's talent.
I’m blown rn and this is slapping way too hard 😂
Excelente música.
of course great, it's bruno mars.
0:49 is such a Bobby Womack vocal moment. What a bop of a tune!
I'm loving the RETRO VIBE😁
I was expecting the tiktok comments but I see matured people on YouTube.
ssss... smoking out the window :))))))
this is on repeat
2:23   that is all.
My neighbor sent me this song… my wife of 8 years cheated on me with her coworker after only working for two weeks….
This got me crying 😂😂 who did them wrong though?
I hear it on vh1 who else
EYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!
BRUNO THREW THE GRENADE BACK
This is DELISH!!!
Very beautiful song, but locked out of heaven is. The best song I’ve ever heard in my entire life.
ICONIC dUO
Everything about this a viiibe 😭🔥
Damn I thought “That’s what he liked” 🤔
Masterpiece 👏
dang that cigarette lasted long
1:33 😩
god this song is perfect
You can't make a golden hoe into a housewife.
Real music need more of this 70's shit i love it
Love this
I love 💕 it! Omg… Now this is music 🎶 Go, Go.. Brothas 😊
how come they did not get any grammy award?..
The lyrics are pretty intense. It's gotta come from a true story. I wonder who are they singing about?
Giving soul train vibez 🖤
moral of the story, if she's from the streets, don't try to wife her, lol.
I wonder how many idiots picked up smoking because of this, thinking it's cool.
🥁
ninoy cosplay
This song goes to show that there are far too many single moms who belong to the streets.
This is just jazzz I love ittt
This ish 🔥🔥🔥
"Gotta give you back to the city"💀 she doesn't belong to the streets! she belongs to the city lol
The king is back
My favorite part is 1:16 I can't stop watching it
this song is acc so sad but it’s such a vibeeee
Simple $100 video, simple classic music, no fake wines and fake bling bling but million views in few days. there guys are G.O.A.Ts
OMG I need this duo in my life!! I've had this on loop since it was put up. Never gonna get tired of hearing this.
I genuinely want to hear this live T_T
Love you music   Me encamto,  ame esta cancion es increible 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
This is awesome
Sad Slow Twerking
Bruno Mars just red pilled more people and told these boys out here to stop simpin'
Seems like everything Silk Sonic makes becomes an instant classic
This is what you call REAL music🎶 and BEST music Artist eveR!
🚨 Lil Wayne has been robbed and shot rare footage 😱👇🏽 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ntB-or3Xh5g
Coolest damn Filipino.
The sexiness of it all 😍
100/10!
Love it so much!
I did not know Taylor Swift's Red (Taylor's Version) came out this week. It's going to be a tight race to Billboard #1. Enjoy both acts, yet I am hoping that Silk Sonic comes out with the edge. This is Gamble & Huff (Jacksons after Motown, Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes, Teddy P) soul-funk mixed with Bootsy and James B. BTW: Both Bruno and Anderson Paak can be great (because they are). It doesn't have to be and/or.
Bring in more retro genre of songs please!!! It's so soothing..
BRUNO MARS DOESNT HAVE A BAD SONG
ELE VOLTOU!!!!
Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak is saving the music industry
Do not smoke! cigarette causes cancer
진짜 이러다 50년대 음악까지 갈 기세임 너무너무 좋아요!! This is the real retro music I love it, Silk Sonic!
She like vapes
Love it
plot twist: big cigarettes paid for this entire production in CASH
Everything I see and hear is perfect!!!
They should of made her with a stop sign and yellow lines because b(#She for the streets
Screaming Hercules part was satisfying af
I cant keep my eyes off the left backup singer He just vibing and feeling the music so much I love it
Not walking barefooted!!!😂😂😂😂😂
I guess over 12k people belong to the city
I just wanna know who influenced my man to be stressin like this. Bruno came in HEAVY holding that cig talking about "THIS B*TCH" after dude died ✨dramatically✨😂😂 I love them so much😌
What happened to keep the door open?
Boo literally fell to the floor then popped back up. Yaas. I love them so much!
🤦🏿‍♂️Da H👀D B👀GIN' Ghetto Dunce Cap wearin' (Bonnets) Gynocrats gonna be mad as 💩 @ this song😆🤦🏿‍♂️🤣🤣💀💀💀
The best Duo!!!
2021
What in the Newport longs? I’m just trying to figure out how them cigarettes last so long lol… and love the “Uncle James with his Camels and just a tad tipsy at the family reunion” choreography! This video is pure bliss!
damn Bruno went from Leaving the Door open for the ladies, to calling @1:36 'this Bitch' for using him for money.   Now hes got smoking problem.
This is the shit I miss
Who else feels the lyrics could’ve also gone like this— “Cause I was wrooong  She belooooong ….. To the Streeeetssss!!”
instant classic. I can already see myself happily married at 65 playing this for my grandkids
He ain't talking to the moon no more.
He went from "imma leave the door open" to "imma change the damn locks"
“Smoking out the window of the benzo, the benzooo...”
Bruno Mars ain't simping no more
10/10
THIS MY ONE!!!! 🙌🏾🚬🚙
someone said "he threw the grenade back" bc of 1:36 bruh i SCREAMED LMFAO
0:57 so smooth man
Well this is what you get for leaving the door open.
the 70s are back
1:35
By the way I am 72 and it brings back memories when is gonna be released
I saved this video playing about 10 times so far I want this album so bad

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTrSN54SkhQ
Mars back with another hit keep streaming Let’s Go https://youtu.be/iNGUFXu_

They don't know how to make a bad song.
Njeeerrrr mantappssss
Not one single ashtray on set
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🏃🏽
Jaw dropping 👏🏽
TikTok brought me here 😂
1:37
Unbelievably good!
That smoking thing…. Is such a turn off….
Goog,you are awesome
And Brunos falsetto is still top tier never underestimate this duo sheesh
Bruno looks my my Tito erik lmao
Mano, Hércules! Somente isso kkkkkk
Instant classic, thanks Bruno & company. Proper song.
Bruno lindo.
Reencarnou Michael  Jackson.estou amando.
So Manhattans vibe
1:37 on loop
_Finally our children will see a 70's show in the 21st century - I hope that one day this culture will come back completely to our arms_
The throwback music got me vibing. This is saved in my playlist now.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
https://studio.youtube.com/video/c9kDWPFHrkE/edit

The way they hit a smoke then sings back without any vocal interruption is on God-tier leveeeeel 🤯🔥
This is just to amazing haha! I love this!

That opening line about kids running 'round his crib like it's Chuck E. Cheese...I don't think a song has hooked me in as quickly as this one has. Just amazing!
Bruh 😂 oh man I'm in love
so smooth! ❤️
i love this song
Benson light 🚬
The lyric: 😭😠😠💀💀 The melody: 😍❤️❤️🥰🥰
I love this on so many levels. Proves good music isn't dead and with 33 million views with 1.1 million likes shows there is an audience begging for more! Bravo!
I can't thank you and Anderson, the musicians, videographer, choreographer, engineers and everyone involved with this album enough. WE NEED THIS. ALBUM OF THE YEAR. Thank you for giving us real music, real singing, love and fun. Our frequency will vibrate at all higher levels because of all of your years of diligence and perfection. The Muses will be very pleased.
LOVE IT!
LOL Anderson Paak on the floor 😂😂
The lyrics of this song are definitely the "SIMP'S ANTHEM"
quebraram o coraçao do brunin dnovo galera,partiu sofrer
This track is sick! I am inspired!
This gives me the mask vibes lol
I hope your trifling ass is walking around barefoot in these streets 😂😂😂😂💀
Why the fuck Bruno Mars disappear every five years then comes back just to fucking out do himself and then disappears for another five
Moral of the song she belongs to the streets
They bring me vibess
softly music....
Anyone notice the size of Bruno’s cigarette? It keeps changing in each frame
i dont listen to this kindof music but this slaps
Modern day “Temptations” 😂😂😂😂
Always, Bruno Mars
What happened to Bruno Mars??
This some REAL 1970’s pimp shit right here! Y’all boyz are the truth! “Hercules!”
Damn! The melody, the combination of Bruno and Anderson's voices, the vibe of this 70s video, the sync of all of them in the dance, that footstep at 01:19 and Anderson playing dead and then reappearing is so perfect, satisfying and of course fun! It takes me to heaven! The best combination of the year: Bruno and Anderson! I already want the next album
I love you Bruno Mars! You're my idol!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
Favorite track of Marcos Sr. 😋
This is the best anti simp anthem of 2021
I love the old school vibe,this is what been missing.love it
Love the sway
It’s the return of the Temptations ❤️❤️
Manosphere is loving this song right now
Must be some good shit they smokin to sing a song like that and turn it to gold .😂👍what's next taking out the trash in my jammies 🎶🎵🎼😂ohhh 😂
Bruno Mars changed his style of music >:c I fucking love it so much :3 <3
shot out to all the batas and single moms who disliked the video, but this ain't about you they don't know you! but we know it hurts!!lol
I love Bruno Mars so freaking much ❤❤❤❤
I can’t wait till it’s 2062 and I pull this out at the cookout and me with the gang put the grands onto game!!
Man, this song's dropping red pills.
the way he just lays on the floor😭
''Im so coold''  is the best verse of all time
If I’m not mistaken, then lyrics are straight “red pill content” 👀!!!!
This whole thing is perfect. Video/Song/Vibe. Perfection
THis is a GREAT song, but This video takes it to a whole ‘notha level!!!! Can’t stop laughing!!!!! omg, so funny!
This is epic.
SE MERECEN TODOOOOOOOO
Love you, Bruno, but did this vibe with .Paak lead you down a dark path to misogyny? "This b*tch.." Really? I'm disappointed. You are so 24k cool. Retool.
THIS VIDEO FIRER
RED PILL!!!!
Here's a song that wont be making it to the top of the charts. Why? Because its the honest 100% truth about the modern western female. And we cant have women out here knowin how bad they really are, not with the femenazis floating around on the internet and in journalist positions. Truth is ladies, you were LIED TO, and you refuse to accept the truth. And because of that, most of yall ended up broke with kids, and are super unhappy. No matter what a man does, he cant fill the position of unfulfilled ambition you've made for yourself.  Dating is pointless these days gents. Wrap it before you tap it, pump, dump, and stack your green. And stay away from marraige.
The 12K dislikes are prolly filled with  ppl doing the exact same and their feelings got hurt.    Or prolly just the younger gens not digging the old vibe😬 On God they're missing out.
bruno mars stop catching grenades  now hmhmm isee.
🔥
Scottie Pippen's Theme song
I like how Anderson play’s dead and then pops up out of nowhere 😭😂
#AFlawlessDiamond
Lo están haciendo perfecto 👌🏼 ✨
They reminding us of how high the bar is for of male vocalists and performers.
is anybody going to talk about how this song is such a throwback type instead of trap
The comedy!!! So proud of these guys! Brilliant music! "She belongs to everybody" lol🙌🏽
Yes.....APACK. laying on the floor. I love this group. I'm sorry. Imma male group in the front row. God bless this group.
lol that was great!!! thank you for this one!!!!!
Simping will only bring you misery, you will never be her first priority if she already have a kid and you’ll have baby daddy intruding on your household.
Bruno went from “drippin in finnese” to “I just got finessed”
Best Halloween costumes, Anderson as David Ruffin and Bruno as Sammy Davis, Jr. 🕶 🎩
I can't stop watching this song , it makes me laugh and I love the vocals
Grammy please ❤️
This is going to be the greatest 70's album that didn't get released in the 70's. Bravo !!!!!!!!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾💕💕💕
This video gives off 80s vibes from TV
Fortnites most Epic Emote Is Going To Come Out Soon
When I saw the videos of michael jackson and people are so inlove with him. Now Im having the same vibes with Bruno Mars <3
Don't F around with women that have kids from another dude! Take your red pill guys!
Eu amo essas musicas que esses caras fazem, eu gosto muito do que eles fazem o que amam, #BRUNOMARS #ANDERSONPARK
They really don’t miss. This is fire
Me: will I like this song tho.  Me (18 seconds later): yes.
Came for @1:36😂😂
2021 simping song
Went from catching grenade to throwing them 😕
I did not expect him to lay on the floor that long 😂
Now this is good music🤣😂
THIS is talent!! When you can take a song this crazy and make it sound so perfect and smooth, you can't deny their talent.
Yes🤩🤩🤩
Went from I’ll take a grenade for you  To i’ll throw a grenade at you
I love the vibes of this song..Feel like real music coming back
It's the Stevie tat for me! 😆 #GOAT 🐐
1:40 Bruno ain't catching no grenade no more he throwing em 💀💀💀
All this video needed was a sexual chocolate cameo.
Now this is music 👏🏼
I’m no a big fan but this, this is genius, this is actually a masterpiece, amazing.
Imagine listening to this while smoking out of the window..
THIS B@#$% GOT ME... I felt that🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This song better win Hella Grammys 🔥
노래 너무 좋다
Love it! Thank you Mars & Anderson... Real music 🎶 again.
From leaving doors open to smoking out windows, they're bringing back the value of good music. Salute
Old school at its finest
Top d+++
Smoking hot slow dance moves are so perfect with the sexy song and music
🔥🔥🔥🔥🧯🧯🧯 this shit is too hawt 😎😎
This song was amazingly written 5yrs ago and sounds Soooooo 2021 with the old skool vibes....Keep bringing amazing music Silk Sonic
I hope they change music FOREVER and we get to say we were here when it happened.
Oh shit in the words of dj Khaled another one! 🔥☝🏻😎
This is fire video the song the vibes just hit different
Goat duo🔥
the 12k dislikes are ladies that knew this song was about her haha

Another great Bruno Mars song.
Where’s Kevin samuels…stat
Listening to this everyday now🙂
This a bop at 1.25 speed, too!
OMG! i just love the fact you have 30+M Views in just 9 days.
🥰🇧🇷💕
I lost it when he popped back in the frame after playing dead. This is too good.
Bruno and Anderson really dropped a masterpiece with this album!!! Filled with hits!!! This might be one of the most soothing and soulful hits to come out in the past few years!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wonder what would happen if you and tauren wells got together
Someone needs to make a mash up with gold digger by kanye , call it smoking golddiggers
Bruno went from”imma leave the door open” to imma change the damn locks
OMG!. i’m dead!
👍
This Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak combo is undefeated
YESSSSS!
Those 12k thumbs down definitely are  Covid positive. Y'all  got no taste.
805 gang out here 💯💯
The message in this song is CRYSTAL CLEAR!
This song is basically saying this btch belongs to the street😂
https://youtu.be/8V_5Mu_AIZM
Is that you Erik Estrada?
Simplemente me quedé sin palabras... increíble 🧐🤝
"This Btch got me paying for her rent"😂😂😂
Is this the best you can do, "bitch"? There are poets all over the world who could write some decent lyrics for you. You've already got everything else. Just not what the world needs right now. Makes me sad to listen to this drivel.
Dis shit dope dis bitch 😆
Alternative Titlle:  She made for the streets
Felt like I really needed this song right now, idk how to explain - it brings back a mixture of memories and dreams
Dou like antes de ouvir, pq VC e foda
Makes me want to smoke
Basically an extended version of saying she for the streets
Blue Jasmine's ex has entered the chat
a god
BRUNOOOO ON THE NOTES AND THE MOVES
Top tier.
Can’t make a bad song can you? 🥰
Did anyone else just notice that everyone has a cigarette in their hand? I was too distracted by the singing and dancing and Anderson dropping to the ground and then getting back up.
1:06 **cue in Future**
The one who pressed dislike is probably Tiffany's kids and Tiffany herself
New King :)
Yuck
This shit soundin and lookin ol school and smooth like a mf. These bitches aint loyal, so find you a lady and do her right.
Who hurt Bruno 🥺😂😂
This group is what’s been missing from good music lately . Just good ole fashioned soulful harmony and melodies that gets you grooving while sitting in the club, at home, a nice bar and just having a good time . This group is fabulous
this music is ON POINT
This song is the reality of modern dating/relationships LOL
what a cheap video,  his label knows that his music flopped, and that he won't sell more than 2,000 copies
This whole cd is 🔥 📛 though. All 9 songs is great. No disappointments at all. Two thumbs up
Was this done in one take?
RESPECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OH MY DAMN! !! Ya’ll need ta quit! 🤣🤣🤣 🔥🔥🔥
The uncles at the cookout making another hit once again...
When I think about Black culture. This is it. Thank the lord.
Awww as an artist I can say this is a certified SLAP 🔥
Bruno went from I'm gonna catch a granede for you to I'm gonna throw a grenade at you 🤣🤣🤣
when you thought Bruno Mars ain't in his prime anymore...
I this but dam who had there kids running all over his house like it’s chucky🤣🤣cheese🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The vibe got me remembering the 70’s and ass wasn’t even born yet.
those cigarettes look ridiculous
this is how you tell a girl she belongs to the streets, respectfully
Bruno had that young MJ bounce at 2:56
This is amazing.
This bitch got me payin the rent, payin for trips, diamonds on the neck, diamonds on the wrist....  GATTDAMN 🤣
After listening to the full album lots of artists come to my mind… (Without pretending to be exhaustive or too specific):  2- Leave the door open (The Stylistics, The Manhattans influence)  3- Fly as me (Stevie Wonder, Kool & the Gang, The Ohio Players influence)  4- After Last Night (The Blackbyrds, Lonnie Liston Smith, Blue Magic influence)  5- Smoking out the window (The Spinners, The O’Jays, Barry White influence)  6- Put on a smile (Four Tops, Commodores, The Dells influence)  7- 777 (James Brown, The Bar Kays, Cameo, Rick James influence)  8- Skate (Marvin Gaye, Al Green influence)  9- Blast Off (Earth Wind and Fire, Heatwave influence)
Kinda like Boyz to Men back in the day..smoooooth 💘
Perfect collab doesn't exi..............s..t
This is fire Bruno MarsTERPIECE
Love it
I swear this song makes me want to smoke deew
this song is so good that i wanna cry
the 60' in 4k
Can  i  have  this  dance
The way Anderson .Paak goes down and pops up after is killing me 💀
Literally every song they make is catchy asf🙈😤🔥💖and him laying on the ground is just taking me out 💀
I hear Ghostface Killah all over this
The album is so fire that even Anderson .Paak couldn't handle himself 1:45
This type of songs makes me feel like a rich
brilliant, omage to that old sound 70's soul, R&B. Love it
🔥
💯💯💯💥top top top
It's not the sister's fault [ in the song] if dude got played. You get what you don't deserve when that's what you want. Don't go looking in alley expecting to bring home a spayed cat. And a another thing, if anyone called me a "B" out of my name. They'd be found in an alley to be taken out with the trash; like their mouth, minus several teeth! If you respect yourself Ladies, your man should know your worth and say your name with respect; like honey dripping from his lips. If he walks beside your crown he won't name slip and keep him coming back; correct.👑 I acknowledge this is some people's drama, but I don't subscribe to negativism.
Never lets down
A other one ☝️
My girlfriend forgot the crab rangoons i asked for so this song was perfect timing. Seriously i almost left her.
This is absolute gold. Video, choreography,... All of it. The way he said Dis Bitchhh, gave me Ike Turner vibes. 😂
Es puro ARTE lo que hacen...🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is RedPilled in every single way imaginable. Not just the message but the settings in the video. The choreography. The dress codes.
As someone “who once loved” your music, until this… why do we ladies have to be the “B” word?  You appealed to many generations with the smooth moves, nice attire, and understandable lyrics… but this… come on “My Brothers,” do better!  You all have mothers, sisters and lady friends!  Also, ladies, real ladies, don’t like the cigarettes hanging from your lips either!  I’d love to be your “image consultant,” as this just set you back, IMHO!  And while I’m on a roll, please get rid of the almost $6K seats at the MGM in Oxon Hill!  I did, before this song, want to see you all, but not at that price, even if someone else paid for it!  I hope you read this @Bruno Mars…
dang
Now no one has any excuse🤣🤣🤣🤣😑😑😑😑😎😎😎😎
Bruno is a mistake you seeing this hahahahaha
Hope y'all come to NYC Would love to go to  a silk sonic concert
She belongs to the street !
I wonder how many times, if any, someone burned themselves. This is up there with Leave the Door Open. I can't wait to hear the album.
Running around the crib like it’s Chuck E. Cheese….  No they gots to go.  Her and her Funky kids.
The ole school is in session...sounds good right about now.
im sorry baby i was working from tiffeny
Bruno Mars went from "please me baby" to " please leave me baby"
Stay away from Single Mothers!
I love this song... in the same genre as She Hates Me and Gold Digging Whore.   Preach my brothas, Preach!
man went from “locked out of heaven” to locked out the house 😭😭
LMAO, it's hilarious how Paak comes out of nowhere for his part.
like to know how many expect a collaboration from Bruno with bts
*stomps in unison* Me: Herculeeeeeeez
I (We) needed this song, the acting, the throwback, everything, just everything hahah
Confessions of a Simp... Blue Pill Blues.....
All 12K dislikes are Baby Mammas. DON'T Date Single Mothers Fellas.. SAVE YOURSELF from playin this on repeat 10 years from now.
Bruno Mars would have been a hit in the 60's
lol, it's Motown 2021, luvin' this.
Man I have never giggled so hard while grooving to an rnb video… the marriage of comic relief and smooth classic rnb feel is genius
This is a ,fucking, jam.
1:34 - 1:54 is pure gold lmao 💚
My favorite song so far, fellas pay attention carefully. 😉
It’s giving the Jackson 5 vibes
Keep it up. Lovin this vibe and style!
Richard Cheese, if you're in this comments section, PLEASE cover the song!
Reminds me of the great Mowtown group "THE TEMPTATIONS"!
After jun k ( from 2pm boy band ) ig story  The song is so good 🔥♥️
Man this whole album is special....And this song....GEESH...! Killa salute KINGS
This song is so good but it's so funny😂😂, dude was on the floor and randomly popped up😭😭 he really said "IM NOT DONE YET"😂
Anderson.Paak carrying this album
Every time this song ends, not to be dramatic, but I wanna die.... *dramatic hand gesture and angst*.....
I can see why starks wants to record with silk sonic, ghostface would sound good over these beats.  This is good music right here!
1:34
The lyrics are on point song sounds soulful with an old school flava. Yeah this is a hit!
O
No she belong to the streets!
That “why you doing this to me giiiirl?” at 1:27 just hits different.
Are we gonna ignore the fact Bruno Mars went from Imma "leave the door open" to "Imma change the damn locks" 🥲
This is the most wonderful song about being chumped I've ever heard.
Such brats so funny
Puta que pariu,fazer um clipe extraordinário fumando cigarro 🚬 é mandar um foda se para o politicamente correto.
Love the red pill message .
Lyrics:  Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mm, mm, mm  Must've spent thirty-five, forty-five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

They are bringing the Afrocentric vibes. Which is a good thing. It like a 70s retro but modern day 00s. I gotta stream this whole album now since I heard this… My ears is curious n want to 👂🏽 more!! #SooSilkyBaby
Definitely giving Vegas
Sends a bad message to the youngsters.
This is not my genre of music but it fucking grooves
https://youtu.be/-gAIlGcQRYs
Phenomenal
These songs are going to be legendary for both of them
This might be my favorite Bruno Mars Anderson .Paak song ever
Anderson has that David Ruffin swag.  This song smooth af
Awesome chooooooooooon...
Dis shit is funny. It's like a parody of a manband, but the music is fire.
.
Do they realise they're promoting smoking?
-1:44 ☀️☀️☀️
Most def playing this in my new house Merry  Christmas 🎄 to me early 😂
awfull
"This BITCH" hits with so much crispy clarity you almost wanna laugh
so true it's very comical this feels like I'm in the past but with HD
The duo we didn't think we needed!
This is real music
Motown.
Your so cool Bruno mars there's nothing change to your vocals
Love you Bruno mars Mahal kita
The background singers thoughhh!
Loving the Bobby Womack shades
What's this? A back-to-the-70s retro act? Nice.
This song is a Red Pill Atomic Bomb.  Leave them baby mommas alone fellas. 💯
Everything in this video is satisfying as hell! Music, the moves, the looks, the humor, and everything else.  🔥🔥🔥
The new song to replace poison! Keep up the good work
Anderson straight came back to life!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣 I'm out ⚰✌
So smooth...The aesthetic,  dance,  voices... The way I Love Bruno Mars,  this song will live on my mind.  🕺🏾
Get up Anderson 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🔥🔥🔥
this beat is bangin
I love that when I watch Bruno Mars' music videos I got a vibe of The Manhattans or other boys bands from those years
WOW TEN OUT OF 10!!
Bruninho não erra nunca. Incrível como ele sempre está entregando trabalhos perfeitos!
For a second there I thought he was gonna say that she belongs to the streets.
One of the best to ever do it , or keep doing it. This dude is keeping good feeling music alive. Not singlehandedly but sheesshhh…..💪🏾😼
"This Bitch..." That ruined the song for me. Won't be a fan of this one.
Hahahaha damm my new anthem!!!! Stay away from ho's haha with kids
Bruno went from ‘imma leave the door open’ to get the hell out my house.
Red-Pill Soul Music on display!!!!!😎👍🏿
Guys, someone call for help. Everytime I see this song in my recommended, I can’t help but click. I think I’ve single-handedly contributed half the views on this video…
Pure talent!! Amen 🙏
yeah, this is my new favourite song
Theme song warning about single mothers
It’s the lyrics for me, WE GOT ONE FELLAS!
The fanciest way in history to say “she for the streets”
loveeeee
They are smoking this music, you can tell how much they're enjoying it!!✌🏻
Who knew we needed this old school vibe music 🎶😅
how can you not dance to this song? like.. its impossible
The way Anderson was playing dead  killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

They should add Donald glover to silk sonic that would be crazy
This song is really a lowkey a red pill song 😂
🔥🔥
These cats are very talented and hilarious at the same time! Luv ya'll!!!
This is probably what Sexual Chocolate thought he sounded like.
Feels good to take a stroll in the 70s a bit!!
I just cry every-time, it’s so funny, it’s so perfect and allows us to remember how great life actually was and can be again. Way too deep, huh? Well that’s how I feel with this song, it says take it slow and don’t live life too seriously-
I have to watch this over and over.. everytime I do, I cry from laughter
Well guys, we know the ladies gonna hate this jam. Shrug......idgaf!
Não tem como, Bruno Mars é o maior artista desde a partida de MJ.. O cara é incrível, sou grato por poder ver e escutar esse cara.
Obrigada a pessoa que quebrou o coração do bruninho
Dang, its hard to sing when you just puffed your dang cigarette. Felt the pressure on the throat! 😁
This 70s retro aesthetic is giving me motown vibes ❣🥰❣ . Definitely need this after the past two years we've had.
Dont date single mothers , death sentence

This is the best music video I have ever seen. It was so much fun to watch and this song just brings me so much joy 😊 The lyrics just make me smile.
Omg!!! I am in LOVE with this music!! Keep it comin!!!
sorry but we need music videos to all of the songs of the album
Love this song. Exactly what I was going through with my ex. He is always running around w/ everyone else while I'm paying bills etc & wanting time with him. He said he left cause he didn't like my little small town. Missed the city life. Had to give him back to the city.
Oooh so this is what the song sounds like.  TikTok is too much.  The version someone did had me falling out.
I read all the comments and still wasn’t prepared for the cut to paak playing dead on the floor 🤣 and then the pop back in was just as good lmfao
Someone is trying to copy The Late David Ruffin !
LMAO ANDERSON'S ' THIS. B1TCH. '
I need this on the vinyl ASAP!
GotDANG!!! WHAT?!?!?!?! Bruno Mars ... lemme get just 1/2 ounce of what you got. Sheeeeet. YOU ARE an AMAZING TALENT!! All of you. Best song and video I've seen in a bit bit. LOVE IT!
Io amo Bruno ❣️❣️❣️❣️ è favoloso
"She belongs  to everybody"
Anderson playing dead and the pop up gets me every time🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂it makes me choking cough every time
I came here just to check ya numbers 32 million in 9 days Go baby 💋💋
Thats life
Love when paak say's "I hope your trifling ass is walking barefoot out here n these streets"
the smoothest way too tell a bih You for THE STREETS💯😂😂😂😂
How they mixed the 70's old school vibes with today's sound is beyond my comprehension as a human being.
Gosh this is so good
Loved this!!!
MR Bungle wanna be....
Didn't know Lebron James could sing harmonies
Strait bop
Much needed Simp Anthem. 🙌🏾
This is so true, only for the diamond part
Yall laughing and shit but anderson is dead. And yall laughing
Uau essa colaboração é tudo o que preciso na vida ❤️😍😍😘😍😍❤️💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
estoy obsesionada con esta canción
my man anderson went guardian down
This is everything
He said give you back to the city 😂
jamming and not actually listening to the lyrics 😂😂 and proceeding to ignore the lyrics it sounds good
LET'S GO♥️
Come on y’all…let’s beat Taylor Swift and get it back up to #1!
Love it 😍
Me encantas, no puedo contigo
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 🔥 🔥
Hmmm....okay😐
Bruno Mars is the type of guy thats doesn't upload to many songs but every while he uploads a banger and i love it
I just like that they make old school music because these guys really make me feel i live at the past
1:30
Me thinking how you could smoke on planes back during the time period they're representing and how funny that would have been if they would have the windows down on a plane. But this music video is everything 🙌❤
Love the old style R&B  Motown vibe.
I felt their pain.
Looking forward to their album its definitely gonna be on point.. These 2 together are the perfect combo
Amazing!!!!
He said he gotta give her back to city😂😂
And I make greens and cornbread,etc...she get 💎 s and rent paid? Somebody's getting the 👢.😉
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS BABYYY
How is it possible that this premiered on Nov 5th and by Nov 14th it has 32 million views?  Because it is genius!  I love Anderson playing dead.  Hilarious!  They look like they are having a party!  LOVE it.
This was beautiful.
😭😭💀👀
Bruno, me haces pecar, soy una mujer casada y no puedoooooo verte asi, so  fine, so good, so nice! Married meeeeee!!

So smooth 💕
The 11K people who disliked this gem, don't have a good taste in music
How many cigarettes did they go through in this video?
That Hercules part is my fav!!!!!!...This whole song and the vocals is everything 💐❤️🥵🤩😫❤️💐
Anderson .Paak in this video is ICONIC
I only came to comment because this single will be in the history books and i can be a part of it this way 😊Amazing job guys, this music is flawless!
💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️

This song and “Love Me” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through these hard times, thank god for music! I love you  💖🌸
Shout out to the assistant keeping the cigarettes long and lit during the entire filming of the video! 🔥
I love this song, but I hope I'll never NEED to listen to this!
My man went from songs like Grenade, Just the Way You Are, and Marry You to this and y'all women still think y'all ain't the problem.... okay 😂😂😂
Boooooo wth last 2 songs are garbage
Keep leaving the door open your going to have one hell of an expensive smoking habit 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Some ppl may feel like the music is recycled with a modern twist but hell every artist does it weather they are paying homage or stealing samples but...ONE THING I LOVE ABOUT THIS SILK SONIC EXPERIENCE IS THE MUSIC IS USHERING IN THT FEEL GOOD  THROWBACK 60'S/ 70'S MUSIC ERA WHERE MUSIC TELLS A STORY EACH TRACK HAS ITS OWN VIBE AN MOOD..#WHENMUSISWASMUSIC NOT ALL THE QUICK FAST BUCK MAKING MUMBLING SINGERS AN RAPPERS RUNNING AROUND NOW
Goodjob you guys, another hit song from you guyz ...Love the soul so smooth...
Yessssss😏😏.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Their voices are so good together!!!!
Just a notice, why do most music since lockdown seems to be at par with the 80s and 90s ... Its baffling!
This has gotta be the smoothest roast I've heard in a while. 🤣🤣🤣
This video is proof that when the song is a hit; less is more 🥰
Dang, this bitch not only got Bruno paying her rent. She got a song about her too….smh
We wanted more of this chick got me paying the rent paying for trips smh
Thank you army tiktok for showing me this fin ass song 💜💜🤣🤣🔥🔥
This is the second girl to fool you Bruno . Do you remember Natalie!! 😂
alternative title for this song would be "She belongs to the street". haha. amazing song nvrtheless.
Love the song tune and dance  style but I didn’t like the name bitch for women though!! 😞
she called herself mine but that was a fucking lie
https://youtu.be/1Pe9whVwwyw😎🔥🔥 thank me later
Omg bruno...
Me and my cat, Ziggy Stardust, just grooving on the vibes of Silk Sonic this Sunday morning.  Can’t take Ziggy outside due to inclement weather, so he’s laying on the sofa listening to Bruno and Anderson
Gotta give u back to the city
2:45-2:54 my life has been made in those  all the way from one to another
Bruno went from catching the Grenade to throw in the grenade
THEY KILLED IT!!!
what kind loser pays for her rent? pathetic.
This is the PERFECT take on an old school feel with new school flavor. This shit hot 🔥 💯
"This bitch got me paying her rent" and im like damn who hurt you bruh
No sé ustedes pero estaría cool una colab de ellos con Gambino
Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak brings back the 80’s vibe. Got me LSS!

She belongs to the streets --Future

Bruno Mars es una estrella 🤯
Silk Sonic bringing straight fire. Side bar this whole album like dat.
Esa gran voz de Bruno Mars es hermosa y no se diga el juego de voces atrás
Gentlemen, you've done it again!🎶
2:24 -2:30  😭why no one talking bout this😂😂
Anderson: I don't want to be dramatic, but I want to die.    But: faints and dies 💀  Me: NOO, died 😭   After: How good is still alive☺️.
Love This Man & This Group!!!! 🤩
so great the best song
Good music is back
Good for her
THIS. BITCH. IS….LOL. Just the right dose of funny and fire. 🔥❤️
The fact that Anderson just pops up after playing dead for so long is what kills me every time
Bruno gets up and immediately falls into the collective dance step. Smoothly choreographed
They just can’t miss!!! 🔥
😆😂🤣 Bad ass kid’s running around. Love this😆😂🤣video
Bruno Mars when from i catch a grenade for you to lmma leave the door open then to am going to close and lock that sh!t🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

"This Bih Got Me Paying Her Rent Paying For Trips" I Died 😭😭😭🤦
This is just PUUUUURE GOLD. The vocals, The Lyrics, The instrumentals....sounds like an original Motown tune... Total throwback!
Bruno went from: when I was your man  To  Bruno: bitch you got me fucked up 😭
1:30 minutes that make me laugh so hard. From granade song to this songs, bruno learned that women is what he thought already 🤭😆

Smokin on that mars paak.
Not my favourite for the b word. :(
Soultrain
New age motown! NICE!
Love you too boy   fans
Sending our love from Russia!

Hilarious!!!! The set!!! The suits! The shoes! The hair! The kicks!!! 1:45  Hey dude, you okay? (Paak face plants and stays there!) oh 1:52 - he's back! LMAO!  The glasses! 2:39 look at the reflection of the stars in Bruno's glasses!! OMG this is great. Bruno doing his amazing thing 2:44 !!  To all the band, and supporting crew - just perfect! The world needed this. Thanks to all who put it together. Still laughing.
1:15 to 1:22 is probably the best thing that happened in music this year
She belongs to the streets the musical
담배지랄 진짜 올드스쿨이네
ぱっと見平井堅のポップスターが思い浮かんだ人いないか
my first impression when heard about this song I was like "there is no way they can make a song better than leave the door open"just after 1 min of playing the song my mind was on fire,repeated the song 50 times,was indeed in desbelief...keep them coming please.
Bruno mars janda
It’s giving Elvis Presley. And that’s not a compliment.
Speechless with delight.  I love You guys. So glad you guys respect and create good music.  Silky Smoothe
So cute and hilarious!!!  I love Silk Sonic!!
This song sounds amazing, but the subject...
1:43
This issssss my songgggggg
i would kill to see them perform their whole set live
She_belongs_to_the_street.mp3
This has such a strong MJ copy-cat feeling.
This song too fire got my screaming along out the window omw home from work haha. #WholeVibe
a maior do álbum!!!!!
So good
*Motown + Philly Soul + Silk Sonic = 2021 Perfection!*
Next level music with the quality of all the masters of music thru the ages, all rolled into one, this Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak collab didn't happen by chance. This is cause and effect on a different plane.
Man listen😂😂😂I want to find this bitch Anderson paak is talking about.the way he said THIS BITCH!!I felt it😂😂😂😂😂
The people who gave this a thumbs down are "AUTOTUNE" fans
Bruh!!! This is hilarious! My man was literally passed out and popped back up out the blue! 😂😂😂😂
Looks like he finally trow back the grenade he was catching for her lol
Probably one of the best comments was Bruno went from “Drippin in finesse” to “Just got finessed” 🤣
A lot of you people are not realizing this is gonna be a classic in 10 years.
What an amazing album 🔥🔥🔥
Damn dis bytch aint no joke makin a man risk their lungs to cancer🤣🤣🤣
Smoking is back! And it’s cooler than ever🤩. Thank you Bruno!!!
Música de verdad en el 2021 😍
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 😍
How did he turn black
It just does not get any better than this-- period, the strong bass line, the harmony is spot on, and this is as smooth as it can possibly get... Chart topper without question, some of their very best yet... This one is going straight to the top of the charts !!!
Bruno Mars is a fucking genius of pop music. I really love his aesthetic proposal, is like go back to the 70s or 80s. Anderson Paak, a huge singer, composer, writer, he fit just fine with Bruno.
Dammmmn🤧🔥
Best watched at 240p
Dana White oughta write them a check.
Funny but also insanely smooth
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Amando tudo issooo  ❤️❤️😍😍
Love it! Love you Bruno!

Smooth, classic songs. They're perfect singing together.

The way he laid out on the floor took me out. 😂
Damm. That's called slu-
💙
nah they are so😫🔥🔥🔥
This song is a straight banger ! I can’t !!
And this is why you don't leave the door open 😁
Lost my voice screamin "This Bitch"😂😂😂 this track is fire🔥🔥🔥
저 마이크 탐난다..
Almost 10 DAYS AT NUMBA 1 TRENDIN
This Song hits sooo hard 💃💃💃💃💃
Bruno could easily play Sammy Davis Jr in a movie. Looks just like him.
This song is the definition of she belongs to the streets
Damn, they're soooo classic! Feels like we're back in 70's and 80's
Love this song!  Even at 1.5 speed it sounds so good and you can dance to it, but they sound like the Chipmunks, so normal speed is it.  I've been listening to Earth Wind & Fire so much lately that I like to speed up slow songs just so I can dance. 😄😄😄
✨
i like the vibes BUT! its sounds soooo similar to Leave the Door Open is this like a part 2?
Look at the Hooligans! Bruno's band is amazing 👏🏾
I love this song
I didn't expect to be so entertained, what a track. Lol.
밀양 박 성공했구마
I love it! Old School Baby!
My Sunday fix
Mantap
When he revived  😂
This song is sponsored by Newport's,  lol
Ninoy Aquino brought me here

담배피면 이런 목소리 안나와
Bruno and Paak like Jordan and Pippen

Quando se faz algo que gosta como a música ESSES dois brincam com tudo voltando anos 70 estrelas os dois pela volta do Amor Demais parabéns Bruno mars e Anderson paak
I had to really see if he was laid out on the floor 🤣🤣
뭔가 슬픈데 기분이 좋아지는 이유는 뭐지?
он так чувствует  🥶 🥶 🥶 🥶 🥶 🥶 🥶
Yasss
So this is paradise right
Fk me pink this is so funny I can only imagine the laughs writing this and making the video was brilliant 😂👏👏👏 just what we all need
They made "she belongs to everybody" sound so damn good yo!
Smoking out the window of the benzo the benzo! 😎💯
I pray that we all reach our dreams 🙏
I freaking love Anderson paak. Old school, hilarious, witty, and a genius musician. This generation really needed him
this stuff hits hard
Just gonna say I got that same fender baseman stack for bass & also that I’m happy that this style of music is finally making it back in this dark horrible no theory basic every 4 bars is the same in every hit radio pop music era
eman manan
Creating this group is best thing yet.I mean what!!! smoking out the window oooo
wow!
This is a hit
This song give me good vibes
It's the cigarettes for me smh I actually thought this was some kind of joke, but it's a real song and video.
That's the hottest shit I seen all year!
I'm threw!!!  I'm dead.... I'm fucking done son.  This was everything I didn't know i needed to see.  anderson.....  you showed your whole ass man.  10/10

Dancing Goat
never had an add that made me watch till the end.
Braziiiil love you 🇧🇷 💖
Old bruno is better who agrees 😟
I thought such a thing impossible but I might even like this better than Leave The Door Open. And Anderson with his moves looks like he is channeling David Ruffin singing My Girl.
I'm french, the sentences in french for definiche this prestation is "c'est de la balle" more than exceptionnel
Nice old skool music men.
😩😩😩
paak and mars never miss
Can't stop playing this song
The lyric seems pissed off but the melody sounds so freaking sweet. Thats what amazes me to death
When Anderson said, "this.. bitch", I wonder how many of my exes felt that in their soul? 🤔🤷🏾‍♀️😏
FINALLY!! The answer to "Tyrone" 😉😆😆😍💕
Yaaaaasss bring back this sounds, instruments and such boys band! I love it! 😍👌🏼 Only imagine some fresh melodies without copy direct parts of old songs 😁😏
he aint a simp no more
great drummer 💯
NBA YOUNGBOY- LAST STANCE-New Single Nov 2021 SNIPPET https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZajk41P5Qs
This has been stuck in my head for approximately ever since it came out
Damn Anderson Paak a real classic dude
Reminds me of a young Michael!! Best Bruno Mars song since he started 🤞😁
Where did they suddenly come from? Where have they been all those years?
I love the vibe they bring together
I respect the hustle and committing to the skit very much HAHAHA
What a musical match made in heaven these two are. 🔥🔥🔥
I'M SOOOO IN LOVE! SILK SONIC Y'ALL AWESOME!🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩
I wanna whole album from these fools. It feels so right
He went from catching the grenade to throwing it 😂😂
When a man can dance like Bruno it makes a Woman's mind wonder;)
It's so hard to let this song end!
Excited for this! Love you Bruno!! Your amazing ! ❤️❤️ So much talent !!
It's funny 😄
As someone who doesn’t follow modern music, this MV caught me off guard with how amazing it is.
Sounds like Motown, and Jackson Five
GET 'EM FELLAS!!!
I've really missed these  little dance routines in the background whilst singing. 70s all over again
🚬🥸🚘
This style of music is everything that is right with society.
The sass that bruno showed when he said her kids be running around his crib like it's chuk-e-cheese is **chefs kiss** 🤌🤌😂
Give them all the awards. Their vocals kill every time and their lyrics are HILARIOUS
This is the best song EVER!!!
the vibe is soo great.
the silk sonic is the best band ever!!!
anderson voice drive me high each time love you
nice
Silk Sonic does. Not. Miss.
I don't smoke. This song is so good, It makes me want to smoke lol
I put this song on repeat and start workout, different vibe😌
Hope will #1 not Korean sheeeettt 😅
THIS BITCH GOT ME PAYING THE RENT,  PAYING FOR TRIPS DIAMONDS ON HER NECK
Premium A1 sauce 👌🏽
it just keeps getting better.
Bruno sounds so much like The Weeknd at the end.
FUN FACT: 33 seconds into “Leave the door open” he sings that his poo is warm but in this song he doesn’t mention his poo at all.
These mfs don’t miss man!!!
আহা, Classy 😎❤️🤗
the way the say "this bitch" got me dead 😂
Loveee this! ❤️
This song is the extremely groovy and long version of saying "Bitch belongs to the streets"
Bruno aint catching those grenades no more
Oh damn... bringing the 70s vibes ❤️❤️❤️..hit me up with emotions 😘😘..Hi from KL, Malaysia.. #brunomarsfanhere
If the 70’s felt like this then I see why they hate the new music 😭🔥🔥🔥
(G)OLD🤟
The dance moves with the lyrics and he laid on the damn floor of the stage their talent is truly priceless even I was calling her a bitch and I don’t know this woman.
the genius that is BRUNO MARS . once in a millenium talent
11k down vote... what the hell is wrong with you people?
Youn know that gone have a Christmas album I'm buying and framing posters lol
Paak and Bruno truly deserve several Grammys for this album and songs within.
Ya remember when sum weird mfs was mad at Bruno Mars for “cultural appropriation” 😭 pretending like his music wasn’t good
Wow, the world needed this kind of music
The transitions of this video are perfect and funny af at the same time....I'm loving this video gives that old school feel from earth wind in fire days with a splash of comedy
why are there 11thousand dislike?
@ 1:31
This is the pettiest and most toxic song I’ve heard and I loved it
What is this bs.... I know I asked for silk sonic to be a thing. But come on. all my t shirts turned into butterfly collars my all my shoes are gaters or platforms, my jeep compass turned into a royal blu caddilac eldorado  with white walls. I never had chest hair all the sudden I got full taco meat that this gold chain an medallion that came from nowhere keeps getting caught in. Lol so
Guys I guess I've never smiled that much before listening to this song <333
They never mess with their writings hope for 10 yrs more song like this
Bruno really went from catching grandes to throwing them
Do u get the vibes from this song like natalie if I'm not mistaken
ITS SO GOOD.
Listen to After Last Night, then Smokin Out The Window, then Put On A Smile in that sequence to get the full story.  😁
When Anderson Paak dropped on the floor I wonder how ey all kept it together and didn’t laugh 😂😂😂this performance is too much 🔥
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Thank You Bruno Mars!!!!!!

Must be that Caroline bitch that Andre 3000 warned us about.

Another title for this song is, "SHE BELONGS TO THE STREETS!!"

Intro: Bootsy Collins] Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window Mm, mm, mm  [Verse 1: Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, & Both] Must've spent thirty-five, forty-five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah, woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  [Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars] This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak] Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (Mmm) But I was wrong 'Cause she belong To everybody, everybody, ooh  [Verse 2: Anderson .Paak] Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me, please (Help me, please, help me, please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  [Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars] This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak] Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How? How could she do this?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's for sure, one thing's for sure) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody, everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) (That girl, yes, she belong to everybody) Ooh  [Interlude: Anderson .Paak] (Oh no) Look here, baby, I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  [Bridge: Bruno Mars] Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  [Chorus: Bruno Mars] Smokin' out the window (Ooh) Singin', "How could she do this to me?"

Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (Woo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody, everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) (Yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody) Ooh
When they say “ this b**” got me… I laugh every time😆 sounds like a love song but actually the opposite.
I don't have the best memory so occasionally I'll sing "Must've 35-45 thousand up at Chuck  E. Cheese"😂
When is the vinyl record coming out already?!??!!!
I think the part where Bruno gets up off his knees and immediately goes back into the dance routine without missing a step is SO impressive! Maybe I've watched this video to many times.
This need a good Chopped and Screwed version. but till then, play this at .75 speed.. and spark up... ENJOY
This shite is out of fugging control! Wow!!
Need a Silk Sonic ft Akeem Ali aka Keemy Casanova song asap
Someone check Anderson's pulse Stat!
1:45 LMAO
Luv it so much 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
1:45 he is really dead
✨✨✨Los géneros musicales vendrán y se irán, pero Bruno Mars sera eterno✨✨✨✨
He hit the floor love it
Wowwwwwww.... 🔥🔥🔥
This was Great. Hilarious, and True as Hell.
Leave the door open Smokin out the window Sitting on the Rooftop
Love it keep it real it’s old school sound with what’s happening in today’s world 🌎
Love all this..jist hope Bruno is healthy because it seems he lost weight and we know he has had substance problems. Hope he's not deep in it.
I changed the video quality to 360p and it honestly fits the vibe even more making it look like it really is from the 70s/80s
You guys rock it! Another awesome song!
The "Oh no!" in the beginning is just  * chef's kiss *
I do love this old school vibe, it suits perfectly to these chaotic times. These guys are doing such a grate job!
Esta canción me hace sentir muy vivo 🥵 viva bruno y Anderson !!!!
Funny to have the words "This Bitch" stuck in my head...keep blurting it out randomly...my wife, boss, customers are like...what did you say?
bruno and anderson.paak’s vocals are incredible and oddly satisfying
This is just amazing.
Its just me or.... *feels a lot like Jackson's Five!!!*  .... *they're AWESOME*
Got it on REPLAY………BABY 🔥🔥🔥🔥💨💨⭐️‼️‼️
Dunno why but the beat kinda reminds me of the Jackson 5 never say goodbye I could be wrong, don’t matter cause this song is 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I might sound old but if you've listened to alot of motown songs like temptations, drifters, four tops, etc, you would think this sounded generic. Compared to those guys, this song is meh. I would forget this song by next year for sure. I know Bruno can do way better than this
It’s the flick of the cigarettes for me lmao 😂
I'm old school . . . I really dislike women being called bitches.  It's a gender slur along the lines of ethnic and racial slurs.  Too bad because this is such killer old school tune.
He ain't gonna talk to the moon anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Perfeitos !!!
when you put the song at 2 times speed it sounds like a adventure time episode
🔥
This is what happens when you leave the door open🤣🤣 jk this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
30M views, more than 1M likes, and 0 dislikes... This is a phenomenon....
Paak hold the cig normal. When he hit it he holding it like a joint 😆 love these brothers 👍🏾

Not him just dead, that's so me
Giving 70 vibes
Full retro satire mode but still manages to slip in a millennial whoop. Genius.
Omg...im laughing so hard. This reminds me of a REALLY good SNL skit.
My man is on the MJ level of entertainment....before all the nonsense of course.
Bruno my libra brotha you and uncle pak hit different man
Best song ever
bruno mars is just one of those artist that nobody "stans" because all of his music is good
😂🤣😂🤣👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Perfect mix of old school and new school - that's Bruno
Do you know what makes this song more funny? There are many women that’s listening to the song in which the song is directed to.
Why is Bruno Mars doing songs with Anderson .Paak & Silk Sonic? - Cause like he did a couple of songs with Cardi B  and he also did his own songs so why isn’t he going solo again?
The back up singer at the left <3
Bruno Mars nos anos 80
i was waiting for them to say "she belonged to the streets" so bad, it sounded so perfect.
This choreography and attitude is fire 🔥
Simply AMAZING collaboration.. This great Artists brings different kind of flavor & I'm LOVING it! So let me just share this dance fitness cover i made for it.. https://youtu.be/ozIrV1RiJug
Yk what's missing here? Green screen effects.
Reminds me of billy paul singing while having a cigar

Long have I waited... - Emperor Palpatine

I love it
Wait a minute, this love started out so timid and so sweet But now she got me (smokin' out the window) Must've spent thirty-five, forty-five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E Cheese Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin': How could she do this to me? (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, oh Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin': Hercules (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin': How could she do this to me? (How? How could you do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me (one things fasho, one things fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong to) to everybody, everybody (yeah, she belong to everybody) That girl there, she belong to everybody (Oh, no) Look here, baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round bare foot in these streets Look out Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me Smokin' out the window (oh) Singin': How could she do this to me? (How could you? How could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong) to everybody, everybody (yeah, she belong to everybody) She belong to everybody, oh

MASTERPEACE
I love their vibe... they can do no wrong
Up n live......what an album....love it ...on repeat....#brunomars#andersonpaak
These dudes made a man’s anthem all the men sing! “ you got smoking out the window!”
Perfect without triangles, eyes, colums etc
why bruno look like a toxic husband from a Madea movie lmfao
1:43 Omg lol👏👏🤩
Pootie tang dun did it again!!!!!!
Bruno Mars finally throwing back all the grenades he caught.
Maximum smoove
"another one" - dj khaled voice
I died when he lay on the floor!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA! I love the 70s Jackson 5 vibe of the video. Well done boys!
Hell yeah!!!!
This song really fits to Former First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos!   ''This bitch got me payin her rent, payin for trips, diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists''
This bitch!!😂😂 The way Anderson Paak's head pops into frame🤣🤣
The start is perfect love this .... very good have to pull up this bumbath..... sick sick
Bruno Te AMOO
Just the way "Leave the door open" had Anderson written all over it, this one is coming straight from Bruno's soul..! I love it...
Just unreal harmonics and the comedy is truly brilliant.  Well done, again.
"She belongs to the streets" the song
Long time no see bruno😍🥰
they so damn smooth wit it!!! 💕 I can't wait to clean my house Saturday morning with this on max volume 😂😂 ima feel like my mama
Smoothest disrespect song
This music was video was straight up just a comedy, because, you know, Anderson.Paak plays dead and all...
It’s beautiful I love it fellas!!!
Bruno Mars is starting to resemble Michael Jackson
Bruno went from “ Ima leave the door open” to im gonna change the locks
These Niggas are dope 😂
Grateful to experience this moment
this will be a classic when i get old
Natalie must have Bruno heated again🤣😭
All I can say is: I'm ready for the tour!! Here's another one for the top of the charts.  The whole album is 🔥🔥!!
Dumbest Bruno Mars song ever. Basically getting on his knees over a witch.
Love it hilarious
!
Am I missing something? OF COURSE she would have you smoking out the window. It's a disgusting, dangerous, smelly habit NO sane person should allow in their homes.
This is the duo we never knew we needed !
The foot hits were on point
I just noticed the old timey "corded microphones" - The set designer went all out.  It is amazing that Bruno and Andy didn't trip over the cords when they were dancing and spinning.
Nice
Bruno went from “I’mma leave the door open” to “I’m changing the damn locks”
i great music ,,,,,,dancing.....
They hit this song to a T right on time 😂😂😂😂😂 love it
bruno is so cute but omg so mainstream... he's more mainstream than the weeknd imo
If “She belongs to the streets” was a song
I can’t help remember that Kevin Heart Joke about the slide out lol
brunos swag will literally never die to me. He is so cool
"I've got to give you back to the streets!" I felt that pain lol
Leave those City Girls Alone 🤣🤣🤣
Hide those biological female hips with that coat girl👍🤪💯
All of them are sharp! ❤️
They are very very good musically but don't overlook the humor. these guys are very funny in their joy.
my guy went from catching a grenade for ya to imma throw it back at ya xD
SMOKIN. ♥
This is so good!
🤣😂🤣
The beauty of this video is they are ALL just having fun! Amazing 👏
I done listened to this song about 58000 times today
They are dope!
This song getting my thru life right now
Love this song. The whole video and vibe but Anderson’s ‘This Bitch’ kills me every time!!
Kids running around like  it's Chuck E Cheese☠☠. I thought this nigga on the ground was sleep🤣🤣
Gold
Is this the same place as Treasure?
Bc I’ll never smoke in my benzo
Not enough time in one lifetime to properly enjoy this gem here...
I didnt know anderson .paak knows the benigno aquino pose (hate me yellow i dont give a thing)
Doing their best Sammy Davis?
Take it back to the days when word play was on display and packaged in a smooth groove! Whole heart is smiling ☺️
I'm sorry but how hard Anderson paak said "This Bitch" got me tickled
I was a big hater in high school no cap but bro Bruno I take it all back!!
That album is fire. That album is ending the year with real chill music u can two step two plus it dnt hurt smoking that good good out the window 😂😂😂
Feeling some funkadelic vibes. What a jam.
They look like they’re having the time of their lives lmao😂😂 good vibes
Es increíble como esta OBRA DE ARTE puede transportarnos a la época de los 70-80, sin dudas forma parte de uno de los discos del año 😎
Damn I got great taste and a hell of an ear for music cause the first thing I said after listening to the album.was this song needed to be their next single and sure enough I wasn't the only one who thought that. I love the old school motown R n b sound and even the music video. I probably would've let the story unfold a little more but I understand they want to make a music video for the old days and im not mad at it, I just love a story to go with the music video. That's why they call it a music video. Bruno Mars just gets better and better and so does Anderson Paak.
LOS AMO DEMASIADO
Just vibin this song, so smooth and satisfying 👌
Never really got into Anderson. Paak but since he's teamed with Bruno dudes gotta new fan lol he can sing. It's a duo that you don't expect to work but it does lol
Add The Weeknd with these two next and no one will stand a chance
OMG 🔥🧡
Whaoooo❤
Damns boys, my girlfriend leave me just few days ago "Oh i thought that girl belonged to only me ~ ...But i Was wrong ~... Cuz she belong to everybody" Such power in this word for me  Love on you, Love on your song  From a sad man ~
Chucky cheese?
When I listen to this song, I get excited and I feel comfortable.
She must be from dirty docks
Sir Pack laying down on da floor had me crackin like crazy whahaha
THIS B*TCH 💪🏽😂
No BC YALL ateee
salam dari binjai
only Al qaeda members would thumbs down this video
I feel like nobody's recognizing how smooth the dancing is in this music video  Its so subtle but they all are grooving exactly in sync its satisfying as hell
iT'S THE CIGARETTE FOR ME!!
Maaaaan.....dis joint vibin 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 damn fools 😂🤣😂🤦🏿
0:31 This B*thc got me paying her rent, paying for trips Diamonds on her neck diamonds on her wrist, and here I am all along. Yo that just hit a little bit different. Sang it Brother!
Leaving my comment here so I can listen to this masterpiece when someone likes it .
When ever they say this bitch, I felt that
Had somebody shown me this video and said it was from a 1982 episode of Soul Train, I would have marveled at what an amazing resolution they'd managed to get off the original tape!
I'd LOVE for them to sing some doo-wop
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love the vibe this group brings
LOVE ME SOME BRUNO MARS, AND SILK SONIC,  ALWAYS HAVE A HITS 😘🤣😂💚😘🤣😂💚💚💚💚
How did he get up so fast hahaha
Anderson Paak on his Eddie Cane in this one 🤣😂
This is so cool! Nuff sed
Bruno going for that Hector Lavoe look
I honestly can't tell, if they know this is ridiculous or are they really trying to bring back the old school type vibe, or do they know that it looks ridiculous
fuck smook..shit smeels bad
Bruno out here looking like everybody's "Uncle Tony."
What the.
30M views for just 8 days? bruno is 💪
Can't wait to play this in like 40 years dating some girl half my age with 6 kids using me for money
He went from catch a grenade for you to throw a grenade at you 😢
The New Age Temptations?
The whole album Silk Sonic 🔁 🎧
🥳🥸🥳
the guitar in the back is giving me serious pleasures
This moment living rent free in my head, 1:52
i’ve never heard bruno cuss like that anderson is a bad influence 😂
Que delicia ouvir Bruno  Mars!
Damn Will…………..🤣🤣
I love how Taylor Swift just flooded the market but Bruno and Anderson hold their own really well. Still trending! Love them all. Next week, it's Adele. <3 <3 <3
Bruh. Bruno took me OUT @ 1:36!!!😂 I must have watched that at least 10 times 🤣

TEMAZO

Which one of y'all bitches broke Bruno Mars 🤔
👍👏😍🥰💫🌟🌟🌟
Não entende nada, mais gostei de tudo 😅❣️
tanto a letra quanto o jeito como eles agem no clipe é cômico demais KKKKKKKK perfeito demais, ARRASARAM!!
She belongs to the streets anthem
omg, you guys are INCREDIBLE, thats freaking AWESOME..... like old Motown, but BETTER... just WOW... LOOOOOOVE it...🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The way Anderson flicks his ash on beat after he says “This. Bitch.” is *CHEF’S KISS!*
Y'all this the funniest and sound good song ever 😂
When you start any song out with Bootsy just saying something, you know shit's about to get real.
Thank you Silk Sonic for making me hope that great music is still alive today despite of some of the generic music I've been hearing today. And with this one, this will become an instant classic along with "Leave the Door Open". Keep up the good work guys and continue to bless us with your extraordinary talent! ❤
They're wild for this one, lol. They did their thing!!!
Classical Masterpiece!!! In the words of Johnny "Aint that a Bitch
Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die
The duo we didn't expect but needed, amazing Melody.
Chuck e cheese sales 📈
I hope these guys keep collaborating in the future, their voices just pair so well together and i really dig the 60s/70s vibe
Why it says 8 days ago and not a week ago 💀
She’s for the streets
Old souls like me and the genuine old folks from the era of the oldies are finally gonna be living our best lives with this one! 🕺🔥🔥🔥
Brothers....maaaan drop the album. BRUNO and ANDERSON laying down that pimpin

I wanna smoke cigarettes after seeing how these dudes flex with it 😂.  Just kidding! These guys are a blessing for music loving people in 2021!!!
I mean it was funny when he was  playing dead on the floor but how he came up from the floor back into the song I died 🤣
I knew Bruno was serious when he said "THIS BITCH" and pointed with his cigarette 🤣🤣🤣
My teacher LOVES your music we even sing count on me every day
silk sonic concerts are gonna be a hell of an experience
Went from _That's what I like._ To _I hate it!_
MJ will be smiling
333
hot boy summer aint far away with this one
Very smooth and catchy sounding, but the lyrics about how they thought they could buy and own a woman is not fresh... Way too common theme and misogynistic.
I cannot stop watching 1:09 i just cannot
Fire! 🔥
just light up and press play.       Shhhhh, just hit repeat.
Get into it yuhhhh get it Bruno Mars 👌🏽🍻
Man singing with Bruno Mars must be so fun I want to
1:42 LOL BRUH 😂😂 he hit the Nate Robinson
Brilliant!!!
30,000 at Tiffany's. She got her bad ass kids running around my crib like it's chuck e. Cheese. 🤣 😆 🤣  Who hurt you? I'm glad my kids not bad.
This a VIBE😍❤️😂
A musica é boa o arranjo excelente , mas se continuar fumando assim vai acabar sem voz.
Video of the century don't @ me!!!💯

Noooo. Not Hercules. 🤣🤣🤣. I love it.
wait till y’all hear about natalie 😳*unorthodox jukebox, track 7, thank me later*
Bruno never fails when it comes to music 😍😍😍
my god im the 42,000 comment this is a privilege
Dave chapelle can do it all lmao
Lyrical transgressiveness is not creativity. Why are performers so obsessed with cursing on their songs? Do they really have that much callous disregard towards the reality that impressionable young people listen to their music and emulate their lyrics in their daily patterns of speech?
Estou viciado nessa música! 🤩
Love Bruno's Hector Lavoe-esque look
That’s a great song 😁
Paak wins the Oscar for playing dead👍👍☺
OMG....seriously smoking out the window is dangerous....but this song hot.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Certain angles, Bruno reminds me of Sammy Davis Jr.
Soo smooth ! Love love love it !! Thank you for some of the best R&B in years.
The bend and the point to the back like a perturbed Black parent in the summertime: “Y’ALL NEED TO QUIT RUNNIN’ IN AND OUT OF THIS HOUSE, LETTING MY GOOD AIR OUT!”
Bringing back the smooth moves of THE Temptations!...YAAAAAAAS!!!!!
Apaixonada por essa música ❤️
These boys are in their mf bag
AMAZING!❤🔥
This just became my new favorite song by them
The best music
Rotfl....so good and so funny
#1 Trending like it should be
Is this a commercial for smoking?
I would have only liked this more if the brother back up singer-dancer on the left was Gucci Mane.
This song is soooo good. This album is that old school style I love. I just pray one day I can get a fraction of the listeners they get to enjoy/listen to my music. A fool can dream, but until then I’ll keep working, this masterpiece just gave me so much inspiration
It was Anderson Paak popping back into frame after dying ‼️🤣🤣🤣🤣
Always on point🔥🔥🔥
Here from Tiktok.
I’m leaving my door open. Come on in Silk Sonic. Sally Butler pa Saturday November 13 2021

Essa pegada retrô acaba comigo 😀

They need to make another CARWASH movie remake and put the Silk Sonic as the whole soundtrack  You youngsters probably have no ideal what I'm talking about😆😆😆
He missed the chance to sing she belong to the streets LOL
The album will go down in music history.  Decades later people will come back for this, mark my word.

Leave the door open part 3. I heard of this the day after it came out but on my tv and I like it so I'm listening go it again here, Nov 14 2021 724am just chilling in bed.
Love it! Old school style, my generation!
Love it!!! 1975 sounds!!!
bruno hasn't been hurt enough to call a woman a bitch...... Anderson on the other hand....
Silk Sonic and Bruno Mars are the only people that will have me lining up to enter a concert 🎶 arena! Big or small
"Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need but I also hope that your trifling ass is walking round barefoot in these streets" 😂😂😂😂
Dis bitch got me fucced up

Eu duvido alguém com essa voz fantástica Bruno Mars🙏👏❤️
Waiting on concert!!!!!

Am I the only one who thinks this would mash up well with Calling All My Lovelies? 🥺
Боже как охуенно
In the wise words of sza, "I belong to nobody, hope that don't bother you, you should mind your business." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The next n 1 hit this week
Eu amei tudo nesse clipe, as aparições do Anderson ficaram demais 😂😂
Who the hell is wasting their vote to hit the thumbs down button, must be dead, dumb and blind!!!
how did they all managed not to laugh when he was lying on the floor? LMAO
I am really digging this trio gnarly
The best music is made when the artist loves making it. Case in point: this. fucking. album.
The drums are INSANE on this entire song thankyou for giving us real music fans hope 🙌 🙏 ❤
the Hercules part is fire 1:17
I’m seeing baby Jackson’s or what?

Marvin Gaye called, he wants his drip back.
The longest smoking cigarettes ever. haha
I can't with this group Lord Jesus help me!
Should have left the door close instead of leaving it open 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruno gave off nothing but Ike vibes when he said "This bitch" 🤣
Oh my gosh 😂😂😂 love this so much.  Kept replaying when Paak jumps back up into the camera.  Heeeeee's Aliiiiiiive!
Finally a song that has an actual story/message
Sencillamente me encanta😍desde la primera vez q la eschuche una y otra vezzz  escuchándola la adoro❤️❤️

IM CRYING LETS GOOOOOOO
que placer visual y auditivo me da esta cancion
They do the best titles .
I jus wanna join the group
11k dislikes is the women that "belong to the streets" 🤷🏾‍♀️
The way Bruno Mars came in. Literally remai s me of my uncle Elton talk about a girlfriend he had in the early 80s . Cigarette and everything. I rolled,!!!  this is phenomenal. The best collaboration.
Are we gonna talk about how they ash out the cigarette???? My favorite part if the video besides him laying on the floor
The best combination!!!!!! In love.
ْ
Evil Bruno Mars be like
gas
They used a capital B and the word was in bold font😭😂
We love you Bruno Mars <3
Let the reaction videos roll in
Let the memes roll in
Uhhhhhh, Very goooood!
Eeeeh Anderson paak sounds incredible
😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
Please play this song on my wedding
I may be right or wrong but it’s my opinion, I think Bruno Mars’s solo songs are better.‼️
Dislikes, thumbs down??? What? Let us enjoy this- go somewhere else! Haters
this is purely amazing. thank you so much!
Big Tabacco approved.     Seriously, years of trying to get people off the cigarette and this video drops.
This song is a masterpiece.
What song did they sample in this? It’s killinggg me because it sounds so familiar
Sounds just like Mayer Hawthorne.
Definitely heavily influenced by 60s 70s soul music. Motown style That was the Golden Era. No wonder the song works so well.
They're killing it
She belongs to the Cityyyyy!
Should’ve never left your door open 🤷🏾‍♀️😂
Anderson voice hit 2:06
It’s the cigarettes for me! 😂😂😂
negros cantando smoking y fumando tabaco?? es lo mas caucasico que he visto
Damn whose the girl who got him singing like this, after all his other songs 🤔🤔🧐
women lost when bruno mars turned against them
I felt every THIS BITCH!!! 😂😂😂😂💕💕
Silk Sonic es lo máximo <3
This video hella dramatic😂but im fwi🔥
Anderson paak dying on the floor..then popping back up to sing  😜😂😂😂. Oh this is for the history books. I smell classic!!! 💕 loving this..
Smokin rn .
damn didnt know lebron james and kevin hart could sing and dance
I like that
Adore you.

The song, the vibe, the aesthetic, and the choreo is really fantastic  Man, I fucking love it
That was alot!!!!
only thing missing was .Paak being inside a CHALK LINE !!! ... and the way I howled when he popped back up/resurrected !! 🤣😅😂😭
He died but never let go of the cigarette 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who would’ve known that Anderson and Bruno was the duo we needed
Love it.
Beautiful...
I think it's about time they do something  with Charlie Wilson,will be a hit .Guys pls spread the news...
Imagine if they they had Raphael Saadiq too as a member. 💫🔥🔥🔥✨
he reminds me of Michael Jackson in the thriller / victory tour days . :)  - people that say he's copying so what. even MJ copied James Brown. if anything it means the gene is passing on . He's a perfectionist like MJ
This definitely fits Bruno’s vibe. He’s just chilling doing what he loves
Bruno went from “leave the door open” to “imma change the damn lock”
Bruno lookin' like a young Sammy Davis Jr.
fuma nao po, fumar da cancir
Só brasileiros com bom gosto ouvem Bruno Mars e Anderson paak
You gotta give him a standing ovation to his contribution to music PERIOD!
Yeah baby, let's get back to some good music and moves! Makes  me think of days when colored folk ruled the world of music like kings 🎵!

This gives me late 80s early 90s music video vibes 😅😅
Song of the year.. I rest my case.
How they got through making this video without completely dissolving into laughter is unbelieveable to me.  lolllllll.  Such a fantastic song.  They have ALL the talent.
Broo straight up dead on the floor 😂  at 1:44
I can't take Bruno seriously when he says 'bitch'
This corny R'nb is alright with me. Brings out the inner 70's pimp, I  never knew I had.

REAL talent!!
1:44  actually LOL'd
Bruno look like the modern day Rick James with all them lines he snorting

That first " this bitch" with AP leaning into the camera's view is straight hilarious!
So 70's ❤️
So fucking creative creative 👌 I would die if someone threw him a grenade
Motown vibes! 🤩 Had me ROLF laying on the floor 🤣
I bet Anderson paak made the chorus
It’s a no for me.  The b word thrown around by men nope.

He went from “talking to the moon” to “Talking to a therapist”
Awesome 🌼
OMG Im in love with this song 😂
Listening to this while smoking out the window.
Ya'll Badd.. love it❤🔥🎶🎤
Uhg why does it have to be such a good music video, such a catch song, but the lyrics are so misogynistic. Expecting that a woman owes him sex in exchange for the money he's spent for her, and implying she is shallow and doesn't care about anything except material things. Plus so much slut shaming.I'm so over that kind of song. But it's soooo good otherwise!
When they showed Anderson Paak on the floor.  I almost fell on the floor laughing! Classically smooth all the way.  Can’t wait to see them live.
Why do I see Bobby Womack in Anderson Paak
The wait was worth it. Thank you Bruno Mars
She's for the streets smdh
Perfeito 👏
OMG🛐 what a good vibe Reminds me a lot of the good Moments✨
At 2:44 got me thinking about someone like dam girl
maso maso
Did i miss the Sponsored by Marlboro Cigarettes sign ? !!!  Stop Glorifying Smoking!   Song is Fire by the way. Smoking  not so much.
eita! que delici🥰
1:36 rip Anderson paak
0:05 SMOKING OUT THE WINDOW
Yasssssss
He ain't going to catch the grenade for you no more
Glad real music like this is coming back

Always a surprise Old skool #1

Muy bien ambientado el video, época del machismo, muy acorde a la canción 👌
HEY YOUTUBE!!!!!! Here is a video with cigarettes, visible.......OMG!@@@  BAN BAN BAN!!!!!   (sarcasm might occur)
Video of the year oms
I thought Tyler will get Grammy for CMIYGL, now i'm not so sure. I think this is Grammy right here.
This shit is so corny. Bruno Mars has no identity. The guy has become a caricature. This music is trash and trashy.
I'd like to dedicate this song to my ex wife 😘🤣🤣 the wall always wins
Bruno Mars at 2:44 <3
This video looked like it was a ton of fun to make.
This the funniest shit ever
The Sync Is Crazy Good
Keep the door was a dope ass love song,Skate was a smooth summer song, but this shit is just dope all around;this that shit you play when you pure Dee tired of that bitch. "This Bitch got me paying her rent,paying for trips, diamond on her neck,diamonds on her wrist" Bruno and Paak on some other shit 😂😂😂😂
I seen these guys so much bruno should just start A band and keep doing the good work they are doing
I'll just sit here and wait for a vinyl to be released
I LIKE YOU BROTHER I LIKE SON NICE
What happened to catching grenades for dis bitch?
Pure masterpiece 🤣❤
This has me cracking up 🤣🤣🤣 I love the song and the video is top notch 👌
soul train worthy
How music should be. Michael Jackson?? Can you hear me up there? Look, look at what they're doing, it's like we never should of left the 70s....
Absolutely healing for my soul if it’s comedy or r&b idc it’s amazing haha… week later and trending number 1, silk sonic never disappoints🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Is it me or is Bruno started to look a bit like Marc Anthony 🥵
형들 나 죽어...ㅜㅜ
This is my songgggg the SWAG
The way Bruno says bitch Too Short is somewhere proud
This song is amazing 😄
I can see them winning every major award 🏅🏅🏆🏆😎😎🤣🤗
Oh i thought that girl belonged to me  But i was wrong  Cause she belong to everybody.  😎😆
1:37
Mais alguém do Brasil🇧🇷,ouvindo esse hino do Bruno mars e do Anderson Paak  amo demais,mais bela canção que soa em meus ouvidos.
1:36
gotta be one of the best music videos in all of music video history
Did anyone else know of "Paak" before this? Because not gonna lie I didn't & he bugged me like nigga this is Bruno's song sit down damn! 🤣🤷🏾‍♂️😎
Omg..I love this..its so real and sexy...keep making your sexy hit after hit...so sexy music!!!
sometimes i just wanna know who hurt bruno in that way
Una, dos, tres, cuantas veces sean. Imposible cansarse de está canción🤯💣
My kinda sound xoxo
I love this song. It is like a 80's hit made in the new Generation and sounded like a old school and new school song at the same time. This is a Festive season hit. Respect!
Hypergamy in a song.
It’s giving ✨🔥
That part with the mic lean? Gave me goosebumps like super-goosebumps.
So very Dapper Dan 🤎🤎✨
Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars are absolutely legendary together. I hope they never stop making these types of songs. They're smooth as hell but always get me cracking up
This is one of those songs that I would never get annoyed at if it was overplayed on the radio.
If “she belongs to the streets” was a song.
That Choreography is tight though!
Who hurt you
Bruno Mars feeding the ego of all his hooligans, forever!
#5 TRENDING!!!!
Mejor que Irene Montero no encuentre esta canción o la prohiben aquí en España seguro.VIVA BRUNO MARS Y ANDERSON PARK PUTOS AMOS.
How Paak laid down is one thing, how he got back up and went back to it is gold lmao 🤣😆
good job guys!!!! Amaze
1:32 "not to be dramatic but I want to die" Stays on the floor acting dead
I was not ready!! These 2 dudes have some creative talent! The video makes me like the song even more now!
This a whole vibe!!!
Anderson paak playing dead on the ground is better than coi leray xxl freestyle
PERFECTION!! I love them! 🤣🤣🤣...the dude on the floor tho🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
I CANNOT STOP WATCHING THIS!! CHILLS‼️ CHILLS‼️ I haven’t downloaded a music video since MJ’s Triller until now! (If they make it downloadable?) In fact I’m going to buy the actual CD (if they still make them 😆) and keep it on replay in my car! I haven’t bought a CD in many years!! PURE GENIUS COLLABORATION! Every part …. vocals, musicians, band, the choreography and conviction of the dancing, outfits are all PURE MAGIC! Thank you so much Silk Sonic for fusing that old school vibe with the new school that I’m sure will be a timeless song and “record”! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
love this
I LOVED this video! Great song, amazing vid....brilliant.
Love this song too much....
awesome
This song is dedicated to every extremely lowbrow female with the audacity
Everyone having created this song and video should win an Oscar, Grammy, Tony, and Obie Award for bringing back style, Black masculinity, real music, artistry, singing, drama and acting. And yes, the woman they're singing about sounds like she's a beeyatch. Making a sad love story fun.
Imagine a song with Bruno Abel and mj
They are truly a Dynamic duo
The one moment he laying on the ground and then he jumped up with the microphone in to the screen !! Man you scared me to death  :)
Pretty Great!
Doing  the most for music in this generation and for what
Bruno love you man ❤️

oh my god this is just immaculate
I wonder why there's people listening to stuff like Travis Scott's when there are real artists like these to listen to 🤔
This is probably the best music video I have ever seen
Why does it feel like this is a parody LOL
Bruno did amazing. Bet let’s not forget about my boy ANDERSON PAAK

My favorite songs are about cancer.
This song is Natalie 2.0!! Old Bruno fans will know.
The people who disliked this song should get a covid test done, because one of the symptoms is no taste.

Bruno ain't no simp anymore
Bruno Mars is clearly on drugs, hard
This the song the youth must listen not travis scott corncet
https://youtu.be/s2OmpAlTLIw
Like the way Bruno sings “ this bitch” with such emphasis
These hoes ain't loyal! Has a new anthem! Sorry Chris
This! Bitch! Got me!!!!🤘😁🤙
damn who hurt u bruno???? 🤧🤧
I'm trying to recite Bruno's "This Bitch" because it would end any argument real quick.
Wow
Damn Imelda Marcos got us paying the rent, paying the bills
Love the absurdities in the video🙌🏾😍
This guy never lets me down... Great music video!!
Bruno switch up on women
Finally ,a real song  .
aseeekkkkkk
you should form a band
I like Anderson. I like Bruno. But I would go into college debt to get 10 silk sonic albums out of these guys.
This song just gets better each time.
to the people who disliked, why?
This is just amazing. I’m glad these guys are together.
I need to know who the tall background singer is!!! lol
What an artist - BRUNO MARS
Is it just me or are there others who don't like a song the first time they hear it, but the more they here it on the radio for example, they end up loving it? For me it was this song and leave the door open. They didn't hit me that hard at first but after listening to them more and more, I ended up lovong them
Who hurt this man?
How can you not loveee them and Bruno is a Libra ♎️ they are so fun💜💜they did amazing as alwasy
This is my song 🔥🔥🔥😂
I love everything about this song, video, their stage presence.
Honestly even though I'm 14 Bruno Mars is one of the most beautiful men I've ever seen in my life
They must have spoken to smokey robinson and otis Williams for pointers to get that 60s and 70s vibe
Anderson. Paak playing dead and getting up few seconds later 🤩
If I was gonna make a movie about Sammy Davis jr I would use Bruno Mars. Dead ringer lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😍😍😍😍😍
lame
DAYUMN
Bruno is a living legend
There must be some good BMTH x Silk Sonic video mash up material in here
They never disappoint
I didn't know Bruno wrote a song about Rent a Girlfriend.
Sheesh
Not to be dramatic but... the amount of times I've watched this video is not high enough..
Bruno Mars is a legend.. The best of his own version..
My man Bruno went from "I'ma Leave The Door Open" to "I'ma Change The Dang Locks."
better than his old songs
This song….is hilariously awesome….I love it!!!!!!
Dedz replay button
Anderson .Paak deserves this i hopef on the Anderson train so late but I’m glad I did he’s a genius and such a musical magician.

And the background dancer/singers 😭😍🤤jesus ! Thank you for blessing us!!!! I cannot wait to hear more….coming from a generation that all you hear is sex sex sex and slutting, stealing, gang banging its nice to here some musical comedy some classic some swag some soul snd keeping everything tasteful

Anderson.Paak took  this song to a another level with his dramatics. They're vocal chemistry is literally a match made in heaven.
Who really is the B!!#h in this equation?...I'm just say'n...

How did the cigarettes last that long
I always want to listening bruno solo song
I love the song your the best
please don't smoke Mr. Bruno Mars
They bring out the best and the worst in each other 😂
If we don't have Jackson at least we have Bruno, they sound alike
The toxic 2021 ending we all needed!
On repeat this Saturday morning
I see those tattoos on Anderson.Paak chest 👀
❤️❤️❤️🇳🇦🇳🇦🇳🇦
Weeknd vs bruno ??
I would love to hear Moon Taeil from Nct cover this song
Beautiful song. But Smoke ???????
This sounds like a song I discovered via Kanye or Knxwledge samples. I can see this comment section 40 years from now filled with "so and so brought me here" or "man how does __ find these old school classics". See you in the future🖖
Its nice 😲❤️
This really is the “she’s for the streets” anthem
Anderson so Funny but so Great x
It's the PPAP guy
True time travelers 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I saw this as an ad but I stayed so long.
must be crazy because i play this hundred times a day without getting bored????? even play this on loop and keep on coming back here???? SIRRRRR
Bruno passou o aluguel da Doja
This is the will / Jada Smith anthem
This takes me back to me, my best friend, and our two best girls in a 70's Camaro, blasting Harold Melvin or Curtiss Mayfield -. . . "Diamonds in the back, sunroof top . ." Love it !  Thank You ! Time to dig through the vinyl and fire up the Thorens
this song is so swag!
1:43 LMAOOOOO
How good it feels to the ears :)
I didn't know I needed this song
When Bruno Mars was saying her kids was running around his crib like it's Chuck-E-Cheese the way he said it it was hilarious
🤣😂💜💜💜💜
It's the dance moves for me
Even though these guys are taking the piss and creating musical comedy. They may have just created a future classic album. Definitely album of the year for me.
Motown style . Superrrr !!!
Why does this look like it was filmed in 60 FPS?
They are so smoothe! Loving real r & b sound.  Enjoy their music so much! Look forward to hearing from them for years to come.
This song just made my day. Good day to you all too.
ROFL. OMG. WTF.
She belong to the streets ,to the streets 🤣🤣
ESSE CARA NÃO TEM MÚSICA RUIM ? LENDA !
😍🔥🔥😍😍😍
So outstanding. Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak, Silk Sonic have taken us to the next, it so resonating, we are back in time
I got no words to explain how good this song is
Smooth as silk
Bruno Mars' simp arc ended now it's the pimp arc
When Anderson said “Look here Baby I hope you find whatever it is that u need,  But I also hope that yo triflin ass is walking round barefoot in these streets” I felt this in soul 😭😭 respectfully
How is this so smooth and cool AF but also hilarious. I need more of this.
Smoking out the window bit$$$$
Anyone else want "william singe" to do a version?
Must've spent thirty-five, forty-five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

Hay vãi chưởng 👍
When Anderson popped back up outta nowhere after he played 🤣
Favourite part 1minute 37 secondes 😭😭😭😭 I'm deceased
They be smokin in this song like they dont have agelic voice like WHAAA--
this is the smoothest way to say that That b*tch belongs to the street
One way to advertise smoking
Please do a Tiny Desk Performance 👀
Exactly what I've been looking for. Old feel with new school lyrics. I've been sleeping on Bruno.
https://youtu.be/6uhq9CnEqyA
Epic
This song and Leave The Door Open are stuck in my mind. BRILLIANT music.
Brilliant.. just brilliant 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

They are slapping this genre.
Great album.

From the thumbnail you can tell it gonna be funky, just they way they are standing says funky. Not to mention the way they are dressed
These guys are too good. I hate them
If this song and vedio not taking you back to your moment then u're not maturing.
Listening to this song while driving to work feels like I want to park my car and dance.🤣🤣 I love this song.
I just stopped smoking a week ago. Now thanks.
Anderson .Paak lying on the floor is hilarious... but It's the Hercules joke for me 😂 #HowDidIMissItTheFirstTimeRound
Now this is a legendary song🙌🏿
Thot that was lebron james n kevin hart.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😍
Perhaps the worst lyrics ever haha

Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?"

Temptation vibes...
God dang... Just beautiful!!! 😍🤩🤤.
Temptations vibes I like it
Love this omg
THAT'S why the views are LOW btw.  Because Bruno Mars used the fcking B word..... I literally stopped enjoying the song as soon as he did that.. as the world changes, people need to LEARN to use more respectable fcking words towards & ABOUT woman. Period. No excuses 🙄💅🏽
So smooth 😂😂😂
I didn't like Bruno using the B word. The song lost its magic as soon as he did that. FAIL !!!! 👎
❤❤❤🎉
even tho I have this song downloaded, I still come back to this video everyday
Pure feel good music right here
holding a cigarette is theme of this song...if this playing on TV my country this will definitely sensored or blurred
no misses
instant classic
banger !
SHE BELONG TO THE STREET!
Protect Bruno at all costs
Bringing back the real Rnb. Music that makes you believe in love no matter what the lyrics say
seems those man in hollywood gettin fuckin high as fuck  in a good way tho
This song really said “she’s for the skreets”
this who?
The only person worthy of being on the remix is Snoop!!!
Lucky for Bruno that's what he like remember 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
rokoke anyar terus setiap frame
Anderson already got me on the "oh no", then the "man on the floor" happened🤯😅🤣
Cigarette price just went up due to this video
LOVE IT SO SMOOTH
Their performance wow
BEYOND WORDS! Irreplaceable Bruno Mars! just wow! and the lyrics too! hahahahaha
It's personal for Bruno.
Never disappoint ❤️❤️❤️
1:33 is the part from tiktok
Hahaha ROFL
Well, this is definitely going on Todd's list.
Sugar daddy anthem
that was so dramatic, I love it **chef's kiss
Best MV Best Lyrics Best Sounds And The Best of Band
That bad ass kids chucky cheese line, I felt that. #Salute PS. Can't believe 11k dislike this. Wtf.
Can we get a remix to this ft OutKast 😇
Bruno get full of that powder and go ham but he a goat I give him his props
Next grammy winner has been choosen. One and only the Silk sonic!
masterpiece
Don’t do the Barry white breath
Very talented 👏✨💕
speed 1.5 please 😝😝😝
Damn this is fire
Honestly I loved the first two Leave the door open n skate, but I can’t stop watching this. Their comical style is just unheard of with superheroes like these two. So on point and they nailed the 70’s old school. I love Bruno’s humble nature too, he really launched Anderson; gave him the lead and introduced him to us. Wow, he is so talented. And Bruno, just a class act. Stay the course guys; next stop, to the moon 🌝 and back.
Is that Anderson .Paak doin the Ninoy Aquino?
A treat for the eyes and ears. Also funny 😂
너의 앨범을 기대해!! 브루노 사랑해!!!!!
Yoooo a new masterpieceeeee🔥 very catchy omg💯
This bi**h lol Where she at coz she crazy
“From the streets did she emerge, and to the streets she will return. And I say unto you, she is for the streets. So be not weary, when she must return from whence she came.” My brethren must remember the Gospel according to Future
This dude went from “When I was your man” to “When I gave a damn”
This is definitely a #1 hit
Leave the door open for the thief LOL
2:55 Michael? 🧐🍷
It’s the “THIS BITCH!” For me 🤣🤣
On repeat!!!!
Bruh this is grooooooovy
Somebody please get SWOOZIE the listen to this. I feel like they made this song for him and other guys out there who was a simp one time in they're life.
Bruno mars looks so different after snorting all that coke
this is what music should be all about.....
"NOT TO BE DRAMATIC" */proceed laying on the floor and act dead
Can y’all se my comment?
bruno dont miss
Who ever disliked this you lame as fuck.
Raising to another level👍👍👍👍love this song
The 11k dislikes are probably those btches Bruno's talking about 😂
looks like bruno made a song about the simple core of the house, from the door to the window, maybe next the wall, who knows???
Nobody: Me at age 7 with those candy cigarettes:
So smooth
Bruno Mars never disappoints.
"not to be dramatic but I wanna die" I felt that.
This collab is the hero the world needs but doesn’t deserve!
Honestly they are amazing together wow and Bruno is my fav I just love him
La puedo escuchar muchas veces y me sigue encantando más ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bringing back the classic vibes..
Dance moves smooth
mano combinação da hr os dois. domina de max
Them cigarettes must be brought to you by Willey Wonka, because I swear those are Everlasting Lung Stoppers
I love the theatrics.😂
Yeeeeees SiiiiiiIiiiiiiir!
bundannn
Anderson "dies", Bruno keeps singing. Anderson pops up and said " Y'all thought I was dead didn't ya"? But not before I call her trifling one last time.😂😂
Qué chicos maravillosos! !
This song and the whole album makes me feel like Anything is possible 😂! *Currently on cloud 9*
Damn 28M view in 8 days.
all imma say is if the same dude that was willing to jump in front of a train for women don’t trust y’all anymore it says something 😂
This is what happens when you leave your door open and a "woman of the streets" AND her kids walk in and take you for "everything". Ijs 😂😂
Bruno will be remembered as a true artist long after he's gone
Bruno I'm obsessed with the new album 🥰😭  iloveyou sooo much bruno mars ❤
comentarios
Love this old school vibes!! 1000% better than the gibberish that's been label has music.

I appreciate Anderson Paak commitment to lying on the floor
日本人いる？！！

Ça sent bon les années 70 ce titre !
I'm not a smoker but this song definitely smokin' hot!
I can’t with y’all.  Everything is Creative genius all around…. I literally laughed through out this whole video.  You have to…or be one of those brothers behind bars wishing you had not done that thing you should not have done.
Love it no matter what
1:44 RIP
Smoking and calling women bitches, that’s taken us back a few centuries.
Send her back to the streets King 😂😂
Fregona canción me encantó ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

This is brilliant and hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣
to be continued…He WOKE UP MARRIED😩🤷🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️💍😎🤣🤣🤣
🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰  *speechless
I love this song but when Anderson Paak popped back up in the screen  had me rolling  that is my favorite  part of the video
It's a YES for me!!!
how are these individuals so smooth. how is that possible
I’m high asf and this is a good song
This is such a good vibe!
fine. fine as hell.
"From the Streets she came, to the streets she shall return"
this is the smoothest camera work in this history of "got that work"
Reminds me of the Jackson 5
Moral of the story fellas is don't simp 😂😂
Here I am for the 10th time today listening to this and singing and dancing to this song in my bathroom
From "I'd catch a grenade for you" to "She belong to everybody". Damn.
Mars-Paak un dúo increíble !!
Bruno made that shit look easy
such a nice way to say she is a wh***: she belong to everybody 😅
This has got to be the classiest 'she belonged to the streets' jam I've ever heard
Future needs to give Bruno advice about women.
chilllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll!
Who is that guy just face down on the ground like that? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro 28 mil in 8 days 😬🔥
THIS B!TCH...
These guys are the new Temps!! LMAO they killin those moves, Anderson up there a little up front of the others like David Ruffin

Shades of Temptations on Soul Train
This is music. I'm sure
This song deserve to hit 1B 🥺❤️.
🔥🔥🔥
Has anyone else noticed how Bruno lips comes together perfectly as he sings EVERY word of this song. You never have to guess what he’s saying. Simply mind blowing. Just READ HIS LIPS 💋💞💞💞💞✨🔥🔥🔥🔥🚬🚬😉soooooo. Smoootch….😅🥲

Anderson .Paak took a nap lmao 🤣
Leave the DOOR open ✅  Smoking at the WINDOW ✅  What’s next? 😂😂
This is the best song on the whole album. I was shocked that the whole album didn't hit as hard as this song but, it is what it is.
paak and bruno will always be the best duo in today’s era as far as bringing old skool back, album is 10/10 💯
Proof there is still hope for music

Remember last message of Yul Brinner before dying : "Happen, whatever happens , NEVER SMOKE" was a famous LUNG CANCER AD.
Kane Brown
at first i thought it was a commercial ads
It's hard to believe Bruno Mars was able to put together both UFC and X-Men in a song and make it work.
No but they literally mentioned that they try to over-funny each other in this song thats why it’s so funny all over.  And to know that this is their first written song together and started as a joke… Top entertainers behavior  Source: apple music vid
'They did it again!!!! Yesssssssss ----
Is this a 3:20 long Smoking advertisement of Tobacco lobby companies?
The lyrics are funny asf!!! Loved it 😉😆
This album is so sick! I thought it would be fun to make a Shred Guitar version of "Smokin Out The Window" so here you go! \m/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WQq5iP-8XY
Mars and Paak collaboration is all this world needed, pray you guys don't split up, this got to be the next best thing since the Jackson 5s
Awesome music,  jamming ! Yessss 😁👏👏👏
Everything about this is a vibe. Holy fuck.
Lol..when I heard..."the bitch". I was 😳😲..lol
Vance Joy
Chris Brown
Bruno Mars
Alessia Can
The Weeknd
this is one giant cigarettes' commercial whatafuckingshame
Bruno Mars went from catching grenades for a bitch, to letting a bitch catch her own grenades.
Bruno Mars is so thin and frail.
I've been waiting for this
Smokin Out The Window lyrics https://youtu.be/AXb8t30BFwg
I do this every day, hahaha.
Love them!! They literally make magic!!!😍🥰🥰🥰💯💯💯
This is my new jam.
Why bruno just skipping throw music throughout out the sentries???😭 he’s Music is so inconsistent like what kind of music dose he actually make? Songs good tho.
Wait a minute, this love started out so timid and so sweet But now she got me (smokin' out the window)  Must've spent thirty-five, forty-five thousand up in Tiffany's (oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E Cheese Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window) Singin': How could she do this to me? (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody, oh   Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin': Hercules (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (help me please, help me please)  Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin': How could she do this to me? (How? How could you do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me (one things fasho, one things fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (she belong to) to everybody, everybody (yeah, she belong to everybody) That girl there, she belong to everybody   (Oh, no) Look here, baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round bare foot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window (oh) Singin': How could she do this to me? (How could you? How could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong)
This song ain't shii thumbs 👇
Dunhill cigarettes + Bar Lounge + Coffee = Vibin’

There are several grammar mistakes in your lyrics, or is it your pronunciation that is the problem?

U guys know what amazing thing about this masterpiece is? Try to change the video qualitiy into 144p
This is what I grew up watching as a kid.  The Motown awards were the best. I love this vibe.
Classic song & visuals
I’m loving this combo 😍😍
It was the way Bruno leaned when he said "bitch"😂.
I’m single handedly getting this video to 100M
This is the classy way to say these hoes are for the streets 😂
Woahhhhhhh
Whenever you put them together it's magic. Every song I've heard so far is crazy smh. So far this is my favorite 💪🏾💪🏾
JSKDKD The faint 😆❤️

Oh bby if you only knew...
WanMor bought me here.
Love love ❤
I'm glad Bruno Mars and Anderson is exposing the average female in 2021 . She doesn't love you. She wants your money SMH
Someone tell Bruno it 2021
Now that’s a music video.
Bro his music just doesn’t feel the same….. this is great but his old ones were better

On repeat! What a classic and groovy way to say “she’s for the streeeeets”!!! Instant hit...everything about it!
I ordered the limited time box with the cd and shirt ❤️❤️ Can’t wait for it to come❤️
I just might need a cigarette after that one!😂✌️
1:33 is iconic
Like Steve Harvey said, "they always come back to the mic no matter what"
Esse estilo de música é top de mais
It is good and I like it very much

ANDERSON “ HERCULES “ is so smooth and on total tap point zzz LOVE IT ….. his entire pose in that moment ⚡️⚡️⚡️⭐️🚬🚬🚬✨
Maan i cant stop hiting the replay button
ANDERSON .PAAK: "Shit, all these new Bruno fans have finally made me break the mainstream!" BRUNO MARS: "Damn, all these new Anderson fans have finally made me legit!" ME: "Fellas, on behalf of all music fans around the world - Thank You for Saving the Music industry!!"
😂 too funny
Sound so happy but the lyrics 😵
PERFECT
Simp anthem
Ai papai não faz isso comigo...              Essa vibe Retro é tudo. É Meu Michael Jackson do novo mundo <3
Guess we are getting more Bruno at the super bowl. Groovy!
Super cool vibe!
Yo I'm dead it's so good but I can't get over how they say "this b@#ch got me paying her rent etc.."🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
After such a sad week this song brings me joy as I hope people will be tempted to learn and listen to the say, not just the Silk Sonic record, but the Temptations, some classic R&B, Soul, Jazz and  Rock. Maybe be inspired to make some new sounds, too!  We need all the smooth vibes and what a great way to learn about music history by  fabulous music inspired by it.   Best song of the year  ♥️
This song is feel like VIBIN' 2008 songs
Not him playing dead
Brilliant!
I just hollered… I wasn’t ready… and when buddy was laid out on the floor… 💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣. Cool ass song tho… 💯
One of the greatest music videos ever made!!!
I cannot stop playing this song. Listening to the lyrics more and more makes it so relatable to me. Dating a woman for the streets is not the best idea.
Alta joya esta canción 🧐🍷
They said she’s for the streets
10/10
Será o novo Michael Jackson?
Bruno is giving me Sammy Davis Jr. energy👌🏽
This man has never made a bad song
That’s a MOTHERF***ING SONG!!!! That’s what the f**k I been waiting on!! I’m going to by the Damn album when it come out! Thanks Brothers great song.❤️🔥🤜🏾🤛🏾🤛🏼

This better be nominated for every reward show hell
As someone who primarily listens to death metal and heavier songs, even I cannot deny how much of a banger this is.  Talent is real regardless of genre

HEE-LARIOUS but SO SMOOTH at the same time. LOVE IT!
A referência ao Michael Jackson 😍❤
Like the old times !
How could she do this to you?...   because .... SIMP
Album too silky and funky. Jaming right now.
Somente Mil reproduções foram minhas! Kkkk😂  (only a thousand reproductions were mine! hahaha😂)
These dudes are about to win so many grammys...this is the best music Ive heard in 20 yrs
Dunno why it reminded me of Hey Ya! by outkast hahaha! Masterpiece
❤️‍🔥
I love Bruno but I really loving how he introduced me to Anderson .paak I love them together

CANCER CANCER CNACER IS COOL ^^
I’m love 🥺
1:36 I felt that

I wanna know who was the bitch that cheated on my man Bruno Mars and got him smoking out the window 🤣🤣
Man silk sonic is so cold. 🥶   gotta love this dudes
is Bruno the closest to Michael Jackson?
Bruh playing dead got me dead myself
Ooooh lordy bringing that ol school RnB/soul vibe!
I don't know if I wanna laugh or vibe to the song and sing it at the top of my lungs. The way they say "THIS BITCH" 🤣
Ok ok ✅
WHO WANTS TO HEAR A LIVE PERFORMANCE 👋🙋🏾‍♂️ Also.. WHAT GENRE IS THIS???
Why would they all have a square 🤣🤣🤣
Yeah they look expensive 👀
gotta get on this drum sheet music pronto for the whole album
Anderson Paak  is amazing! Love to the Free Nationals too!
This is Gold🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thanks bruno mars for bringing back old school enough with RAP music hope the rest of all artistdwill follow
They could clean up the language and keep the same concept, but I love the feel of the song. Truly talented guys.
What
I know they not talking about the same women they left the door open for 😭😭
Why do I imagine the Bakusquad singing this
The first “this bitch” takes me out everytime
😢😢😢❤
The album is 🔥
This sucks
My Lola Ciling told me to tell you you’re naughty for smoking even while you sing and dance 😂 I wish I recorded a reaction video 😂😂😂
Imagine hearing this song back in the 70s
Love all his song 😍
It's a vibe!! Thank you guys.
Anderson said he hope she walking around bare feet in the streets😂😂😂
This is an uptempo leave the for open. Sounds the same. Y'all... Stop playing and lying to them and yourselves...👏🏼
Que temazos, me encanta Bruno Mars
Harder than ever
When Anderson said Hercules 🤣. I love this albums feels good and humor. They all have such great sense of humor and fun. 😁
Not Anderson playing dead then popping up back out of nowhere 😭😭😭and Bruno’s “this bitch “ sounded so personal 😂😭😭these guys are funny asf delivering a masterpiece and comedy in one ..pure TALENT !!!
He went from catching the Grenade to throwing it.

Bruno is a perfectionist. That is why his music is so good
I'm sorry. Bruno is just soul. Black white yellow purple I don't care what color he is

They ALWAYS understand the assignments 😌!
All of you guys deserve every penny you earn. Great music. Great collaboration
The Temptations but today lol
They gotta collab with Andre 3000
Nicest way to say she belongs to the streets
1:43
I said it before and I'll say it again, BLASIANS DON'T ACKRITE 🤣🤣 man's on the floor on his on MV hahahah
Watching this feels like watching a Key and Peele sketch
That Chuck E. Cheese line was hard though 😂😂😂😂
This Should be the the National Red Pill Song. Welcome! Come on in, the water's fine.
They have to make 1000 more songs together. All of their music is taking me to a good place. 😁
I love this flashback to the great harmonic groups of the 60s!  The song is rather funny, but pretty.  And Mr. Paak falling down dead from sadness was hilarious!  A great video!
sexyyyyy
Goose bump music.
😂😂😂 “this bitch got me paying her rent…” had me laughing out super loud! Woo🤪🤣🤣
And the GRAMMY AWARD GOES TO... 🎶 🎵 ❤

Bruno went from, catch a grenade for ya to throwing the grenade at ya😂😂😂😂😂
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl?

Melhor música da vida
Wow..Old School Motown Vibe, Excellent
Fire!
I just love how the music industry seems to have finally realised that embracing old skool will reap rewards......there is a whole bunch of this type of music coming out now that is satisfying those with a more mature (melodically speaking lol) ear ;-)
When you hear it and the music stays in your head 🥰
this album will be timeless and def will win a grammy
If there was ever a bigger vibe I’d like to see it
I'm in love with this 📀🎶production!💚💜
:0
Shoulda been she belonged to the streets instead of she belonged to everybody
GUYS THIS GIVES ME ENERGYY 😩
Another Good one!!😳😘😘
Wow
Love this song ! 😅🤪
The media spent countless years promoting “Smoking is Bad” for all generation..   Only to have Bruno Mars undo it all in one song.. #LegendStatus ✌🏾
Bruno’s “THIS BISH GOT ME” was strong from the core he ready to tell his story 😂😂😂

🔥
Who's here before 50 million ?
JUST WOW-
This my song of the year now
Bruno: "I should've bought you flowers..."  Also Bruno: " *This. Bitch.* Got me paying her rent.... "
2021… FK yo chet, I’m out!!!! Taking no prisoners 😂😂😂
Speechless! Beautiful! Love them! 💖
🔥🔥🔥
Eu só preciso assitir um show Deussss 😅
Essa vide incrível
Please just give us the album I cannot do THIS anymore
Unstoppable!
Y’all better get it!
This is a whole ass vibe
Anderson Paak is so animated.  😩 Hilarious!
Bruno deadass went from “Leave a door open for ya” to “Imma change the locks on ya” From “Catch a grenade for you” to “Toss a grenade at you” Now he’s talking shit ‘bout you to the moon
Back to the 70s...I love it, Bruno
You just don’t know who to praise Anderson or Bruno❤️🔥
God! How I love Bruno's treble
Since these dudes linked up they haven’t missed a beat yet 🔥
The dance moves are fantastic
I Know I’m Not The Only One🕺🏽📈
I never repeated a song so many times before
Ameiii, lembra muito as músicas das antigas.. tempo bom...
🔥🔥🔥
te kiero mucho
Money World!
who the fuck disliking this lmao
What a shame. I have a lot of respect for Bruno's pure talent. But, to appropriate legacy Black music styles, then layer them with nonsense, little boy lyrical content demeaning to women is a huge insult to Black Americans, and a wasted opportunity. If you want to borrow from something, son, make it better, do honor to it or at least try to improve upon it. Don't mock it. Having a couple of co-signing black guys in your band doesn't entitle you to toy around with our classic compositions nor our culture. Maybe go back and listen to the substance and heart that was in much of that music, before you mimic pieces of it for a quick download/payday.
I love that Dave Chappelle finally started doing music
Good job. Shit got good satirical moments but overall great track
Let’s hope this Silk Sonic album finally gets Anderson .Paak the recognition he’s deserved for the past 5/6 years !! All hits , no misses here 🔥🕺
This song is so ridiculous that I love it 🤣🤣
Anderson. Paak and Bruno Mars is such a good combo.
What an incredible blend of old school artistry with new school sensibilities. The perfect way to gain an audience. Bruno, Anderson, this a match made in heaven! Please don't stop.
Every time I hear  Hercules Hercules all I think of is Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor 😂😂
Yesss!!! Love Bruno!!!!
Okay i like the jam.
Bruno went from catch a grenade for you to I throw the grenade at you
Did they just bring crackhead comedy  culture to classic R&B? While singing their butts off? Didn't know I needed this! Thanks, fellas!
They only 2 artist that can bring back the 70’s with a twist of R&B
Believe that Jesus was crucified for your sins and was raised from the dead and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins and You shall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost, " John P Kee " Jesus is real thats a song this is Bumblebee!
Album of the year, music video of the year, ect ect ect.
The wages of sin is death but, the Gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, ACIENT OF DAYS thats a song this is Bumblebee I really did let honey bees eat from me
Bruno and Anderson really just went back in time and invented "she belong to the streets".
Love this
Kevin Samuels and TK Kirkland listening to this non stop
Silk sonic strikes again 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Cade os BR pra ver essa maravilha de musica.
Lo que me encanta de este disco en general es que Bruno está haciendo lo que siempre quiso y está feliz y eso me llena de un sentimiento que en conjunción de la magia de la música que transmite el álbum hace que sea perfecta su experiencia. Grande Silk Sonic
Who in their right mind disliked this song?.....y'all trippin 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
🇧🇷🇧🇷
lmaoooooo
Its the play dead and POP UP. for me🤣🤣🤣🤣
Between Anderson;s head popping up out of nowhere and him playing dead on the floor is just classic.  lol  These guys are comedians.  lol
This is so good. Haha that B is rated E
27
amo
This song funny🤣
😁
I cant stop listening to this. Its artform reclaimed from the past, transported into the future, and given its proper respect + elevated even further.
This is too smooth for school, you hear me? This is the duo we didn’t know we needed. ❤️
They make Christmas album but this funny
♡
#1 Trending for Music in Aus!! 🤗💕
But somehow he made this sound fit into 2021...lol 👏👏👏 he made me like the song...
📈
LOVE, this is amazing
He went from “throw a grenade for ya” to “throw a grenade at ya”
When I need seratonin I come here.
https://youtu.be/Lzxtv0YOW_M
Honestly, I wasn't prepared to laugh and enjoy a song so much.
What an artist Bruno Mars is 👌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
He never disappoints
“But I also hope that your trifling ass is walking around bare foot in these streets”. 😂😂🤌🏽🤌🏽
Bruno i am62 year old fan. I hope you're one of those celebs that sometimes answer these messages. Your Mom is proud of you 👏
Bruno Mars went from catching grenades for her to let that bitch blow up 😂🤣😂🤣
If "She's for the Streets" had an anthem, this would be it.
They’re hilarious I can’t get enough of this 🤣🤣🤣
⚡️⚡️
TEARSSS!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!
Bruno Mars never disappoints!!!
Paak is on one of the greatest creative runs in the history of popular music. The California series, Yes Lawd!, Compton, AEWSS, various features... he's THE artist for an era.
This is basicaly the song version of "She belongs to the streets!"
Bruno Mars channeling Sammy Davis Jr. here. He looks very much like him.
This man 🥺❤️🥲
They didn’t crack one smile. I couldn’t have gotten through it! 😂😂
Man this song is killing me it's good but can we just talk about that Bruno mars looks thin now
I'm disappointed about their album as I like uptempos funk and soul. And apart from two tracks (one being with only a rap of Anderson Paak), there is only ballads like this one... Boooring... but it's going to work anyway. I just expected something more dancefloor oriented like Uptown funk, 24k Magic or Finesse
That cain got Bruno looking kinda skimp lmao
Loovvve !!!
The 10k diss likes are from people smoking out the window 🪟.
Q belezura de música 👏👏👏👏😍
"Hercules Hercules Hercules"  - Nutty Professor 😂😂
“ I hope ur trifling ass is walking around barefoot out in these streets.”  Why did that crack me up 😂😂
👏🏿Hercules! Hercules!👏🏿😂😂
The way he jumps up is toooooo funny 😂😂
Revolutionary music right here

OOOOMMMMFFFFGGG I LOVE THIS SONG
Silk Sonic 😍
Bruno my man went from catching granade for ya to throwing shit back at ya. 😂
Bruno (and his band) keeps nailing each style... 😎 🔥🔥
Bruno consistently puffing on his ciggy is so damn funny to me for some reason.
Hooooly shiiit
Who hurt Bruno whoooo
Bruno went from "i'll catch a grenade for you" to " this b**** got me f^cked up"  WHO HURT HIM 😂
Not to be dramatic but yet dramatic in a romantically comical way😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is hilarious and brilliant at the same time
WHO GAVE THIS BOP, THIS MASTERPIECE, A THUMBS DOWN?! 🤨
This BEACH 🤌🏼
I wona be the only rapper in silk sonic 😂😂😂
They then closed the door and threw away they key with this one🤣🤣
Bruno Mars voice is just incredible. Absolutely insane the way his voice cuts through the mix, such a good sound
promoting smoking?  really. NOT a wise move. For ANYONE.
Dave Chappelle and Bruno Mars had a love child named Anderson Paak
POV @ 0:21, you’re laying in bed sleep and ya baby mama come with your phone and ask who tf is this standing exactly like Bruno 💀😂
0:32  1:16   2:44 LOVE!!!

Plot twist : this was a commercial for tobacco. But ended up being a banger.
Simping is dangerous and expensive
Raising the bar!

Comedic. Musical. Genius.
someone said Bruno Mars went from "When I was your Man" to "When I gave a damn" 💀💀💀
Just how much money did they get from cigarette companies?
"Smokin Out The Window" lyrics   Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
It’s so gooood!!!!

Kings of Drama💅
This song got me searching "how to get rid of a song constantly playing in my mind" 😰
It's crazy how many people come back to this masterpiece everyday! Let's see which legends are listening to this in November...
💀💀💀💀💀💀
A 3 decade long wait now officially over. There's music again. Thank you <3
I'm leaving this comment here so after a month or a year when someone likes it, I get reminded of this song ❤
I know they had to contain themselves through this whole set🤣 this is gold
Sempre soube que ele é filho de Michael jackson
new favourite song
🤸🌈🤩😘💚😘💙😘💜😘❤️🇧🇷😘
They didn't milly rock 😂😂 0:20
I love how this song is an ad. I love it.
Groovy bass line, harmonies and drum chops. Good music
Cool
Damn, that is amazing 😀
This video took me out. I'm laughing my ass off. It is a visual trip back in time, takes the viewer right back to the day.
WOW! U"r the BEST!
Prediction: this is the album of the year
Dave Chappelle should do this...LOL
Perfect! Brings me back to the Motown boys bands time. :-)
I love the homosexual vibes in this! Thank you for embracing the community and empowering it!
Damn y’all good! Naw FANTASTIC!
im shook
ESSA MÚSICA TÁ TÃO BOA
on a loop
the only reason i hate this song is because it has only 3 minutes...
Memes are coming
How I'd love to see this group with Devon Gilfillan, meerrn 😭
When Anderson passed out on the floor just took me out lol
Friday mood 😤
"how do you say she belongs to the streets without saying she belongs to the streets?"
Must be some good good, not only to smoking out da window but to make a song about it. Throw it up in the air and it becomes sunshine

Red  Pill Anthem
Absolutely amazing 🧡
Who the heck is the 10k that thumbs downed this. Y’all get a thumbs down👎🏼 . Great song and great music video
Beautiful
I love Bruno smooth AF !! 😍👍😅
🤣🤣🤣
Smoothest diss record ever lol
I don’t know about you, but this is giving me The Temptations vibes except of all the members were David Ruffin lol
Thiss is so bad
This is amazing! They did this! 😌😌😌
令人笑到翻過去的歌詞🤣
Bring back R&B.
Natalie really screwed him up
I don't understand how anderson.paak and Bruno Mars exude both old man and youthful energy in the same song
The comedy is top.notch. !👏👏👏👏
Good music deserves to be heard by millions of people.
This song and video is awesome when my man played dead on the floor that's my part 😆
🔥
Did Anderson said piso
Guessing how much money they got from the cigarette lobby?
This song is dedicated to will Smith
The adjective ‘tender’ tickles me when used to describe love or gentleness. Like, the same word used to describe painful, sensitive could mean that too?  Aside from that, this is pure brilliance by one of the most creative music duos in today’s poppy-filled, trap-dominant, mumble-rapping world.
Amazing Bruno mars...
Always lovely lyrics and song amazing voices ❤
This b**** got EVERYBODY smoking out the window. 🤣
The 1:19 reminded me of Fluffy. “Hercules, Hercules”
TE AMO AMORR
Did this ninja just die, and then came back to life on the next verse? 😳🤔😂
Suena diferente en auriculares y en parlante :0
This sounds real old school🔥🔥🔥
aquarius + libra smoothness
The average guy is thinking all this shit. Bout time someone put it in a song.
HOLY SHIT.....THIS IS AMAZING!!!!
I don't know why from begining till the day Bruno song's always booming and become hits ! Legit and addiction,, he succeed Made the vibes with sweet harmony ❤️ Event though the lyric so hilarious and Horrible life story hahaha

Bruh, Anderson on the floor.😂 Popping back up.💀💯
He Went from “when I was your man” to “when I gave a damn”
Basically this whole song is bout a girl who belongs to the streets. Respect.
El hijo de Michel Jackson

Top demais, talento puro Br aqui hehe
watching it at 360p will make it way better
1:37 in love with his face expression and acting
🔥🔥🔥
This is one of those situations where you never seen this being a thing because they were so great individually but together it moves the needle in a way that you never thought possible. This is what music should feel like.
Very interesting about the cigarettes. But such things are okay with YouTube if there's enough money involved. Or maybe it's okay because they never put them to their lips? Oh, and good song guys.
I was waiting for their cigarettes to melt 😆
This is album is a perfect blend of 70s, musicianship, Motown showmanship, cleverness, emotion and tongue n cheek comedy all tied together with lyrics depicting the urban society of today (but certainly not as rude as much of hip-hop). I’ve been in the music business for 48 years and these tracks from Silk Sonic are not only genius but serious album-of-the-year material.
Amazing!!!
I have no doubt Bruno’s talent is one the greatest things I’ve witness in music . And tbh up I don’t really listen to him . But damn .
The emphasis on “This Bitch” 😂
These days you can notice that every pop musician is trying to make the old vibes songs. I don't wanna write their name but you can see them in every trending charts/playlists with an 80s/90s synthwave type music. They are trying to be mainstream and tries to follow the recent past year's hits (like most of Bruno's hits). If you pay attention to detail you can realize it's not sounding actually like an old retro song, all these new 80s sounding songs doesn't sound original same as retro-pop music. It's all made in computer and DAW softwares, which sounds good but not exact like an authentic old song.   But in Bruno's music you can purely feel that original old music vibes. He makes his own melodies, they try to play real instruments, Vocal mixings just same as old songs, a smooth and simple music video concept and setup, groove and funk bassline elements and even the lyrics are too perfect as an 80s R&B song. In my point of view, they are the most talented and realest musician of this generation. There's no question now why they took too long to make an average length project. If these album underperforms, this generation has lost a music taste so badly.
Yall did that
Bruno mars forever ❤️❤️❤️
You don’t need to be a good dancer just viiiiiibbbbeeee to the beat
Feel good music has returned!!!
Ng ae VN đâu rồi
A legend.
This is smooth as a baby's bum i tell u that man. This is the kind of shi I haven't saw in a looooong time. This is historical. *Read this in a Scottish or brittish hood accent so it'll sound cooler
Top demais, talento puro Br aqui hehe
Outro nível meu brother 🤭🔥❤️
Best song everything is amazing about this video ! Hell yes !
❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Silk sonic the new Isley brothers if U peeps don't know who im talking about den listen 2 summer breeze
so beautiful
Got to give back to the city!
Everyone that left the door open is now smoking out of the window 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comedy r&b sad song that makes you happy.
Anderson .Paak (@ 0:31) really reminds me of that seagull in Nemo.
@3:01 is where that man sealed the deal as one of the greatest male vocalist of this generation.
This is a classic🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👻🤪
This is giving Switch and El Debarge vibes!
0:15 Paaks "Ohhhh noooo!" kills me every single time bro
Estou presa nessa album 🙂❤🇧🇷
Clearly this is a timeless symphony!!
This has to the best and funniest song ever
Divinos 💓💓💓
Sugar Daddy's Anthem?
Gotta listen to “After Last Night” right before this song for full effect 😭
Great to see that even if Soul music was invented in 2021 it would still be Amazing!!! Big tune!!!
It’s the extra emphasis that both of them put on “THIS BITCH” 😂😂😂. The fake cigarettes, the dramatic I am dead with the perfect pop up😂😂😂 and the lyrics got me screaming. Their collaborations together is on point👏🏾
What genre is this kind of music ❤️🔥
TWO THINGS...1.) THIS SHYT RIGHT HERE!!!!! 2.) HE FELL THE EFF OUT N I DIED LAUGHIN!!!! THIS IS ART!!!!
He's dying
Masterclass
Now this is some JAAAAAMMM
The "This bitch" part will forever be my favorite
Sweet song to....
The Charlie Murphy & Rick James banger we never got to see!
Hey what‘s Sammy Davis Jr. doin with the Jackson4?
Should have just let her went in with her plans and stayed home by yourself that day my G
Anderson.Paak dying on the ground took me out🤜😂😂
Desde México esuchandote mi amor! Bruno Mars
I hope this album has a song with a The Weeknd feat. It would be really interesting  to see what he could do collaborating with this whole vibe.
my love you always making art
These two are a match made in heaven, goddamn. They're perfect for each other, both musically and personality-wise. Can't wait for the full album!
Treasure set
I swear these two were pimps in a former life😂😂😂
Every time they said “This. B****.” I cracked up 😂
*a certified hood classic *
WHERES THE ALBUM YALL
Coke is a magical thing
Very NICE Mr Mars...very nice indeed!
hay algo que este hombre no haga bien?🤩
Bruno is fed tf up lmao
We need Silk Sonic without Bruno, then it’ll be authentic. Bruno imitating black music is nauseating…he’s been looking up to black artist all his life and now he gets to imitate on a big scale…its not authentic. The swagger isnt there
The blend of comedy in this presentation was solid gold. I almost choked on my breakfast when Paak was laid out on the floor. 💀
For the lyrics: Sounds more like you purchased yourself a hooker rather than a girlfriend.  Better off without that skank- just sayin.  For the video: Hercules stomp!!  And dyin on the floor- too funny!!
Just when you thought it couldn’t get better than “leave the door open”, he kills it again
From catching a grenade to bout to catch a case laugh out loud
T's'got some tralala touching vibe...
Who else think this might be inspired by jada and will Smith... like at least a tiny bit
How am I jus now finding this life affirming video lol
ブルーノ様、最高です この懐かしい感じがいいな 落ち着く いろんなテイストの曲があるから、どんな時でもピッタリの曲がブルーノ様にはある
That’s a cold jam
after years of begging and begging, he finally just gave us water to survive another 5 to 10 years until he comes back 😭
very nice Mars, another banger hit
🔥
silk sonic make music is for oldies lover like me
Fire...🔥🔥🔥
Bruno mars is single handedly carrying this genre of Music! And I LOVE IT!!!
Anderson .Paak and Bruno go together so freakin’ well like peanut butter & jelly 😚🤌🏼🔥
This gives me treasure mv vibes
im in wow
I swear this will become one of the best old songs in the future HAHAHAHA
Hey Bruno, Frank Ybarra Of Las Vegas. Dude of course your tunes ate Fire. But. and NOT a bad BUT , I was wondering if you could maybe look into the possibility of singing a few Shalamar   tunes. They have such a smooooth sound I think it really fits your style. And I know without a doubt the BM fans would love it. Maybe do...This Ring... aka For The Lover In You. Dude you would kill it. Trust me. Sincerely a 61 year old Burno Mars Fan till the end and a pretty bright Mother...You know the rest.
Legend decides  my neighbors song
Please make a video for “After Last Night”
well playing this song at the bedroom at 1am like go away to the idk where is that
Ight who broke Bruno!?! 😤
OMG 🤣🤣.my ex ran into one these women.
This is the chirstmas theme song
pov: you searched the song up with “this bitch” and it popped up :)
Bruno di dog and the paak of Newport normalized calling women BITCHES because you got taken on a ride you paid for.

Bruninho tá machucado 😩

I alone must've contributed about 1k views to this masterpiece. Also, I think I'm going to take up smoking.
Traduzir em português
Cuz she belong to everybody, everybody!!!!
https://youtu.be/neFT0U7IWRg The unspoken file video. Thank me later
Bruno went from being a simp to a pimp in the span of two-three albums.   Now that's character development.
Me regresa a la época de los 70 s'🎶
Can we talk about the how smooth the choreography for a second 😳😳
THAT"S THE BOOTSY COLLINS ON THE INTRO I DIDN'T NOTICE THE FIRST TIME BROOOOOO.
Why anderson pop in the camera like that lol😂😂
ถ่าย MV นี้ หมดบุหรี่ไปกี่มวล หรอครับ ♥
Bruno went from leave the door open to I’m getting a new lock😭
Bruno Mars looks like Sammy Davis Jr here
I love this song. Anderson is hilarious and Bruno is funny as well. But Anderson dying on the floor 🤣😂🤣
Они восхитительны !!!
Give the men a love song to cry to, you better!
Threw that grenade right back
Is there any "Original Material" in Bruno's catalog? Todays music, and the effort put into it, is just sad!
I love this song!! I have listened to it at least 20 times!! I have been LMAO to this great video......went to bed with the song in my head and when I woke up this morning it was the first thing that popped into my head 🤣🤣
immaculate vibes
Pure quality music here
Wow!! This is really perfection
Thank you so much!! beyond words , awesome !! 💞💞💞💞💞💞

Tu comentario en español que buscabas ......tamo activo
We needed this
SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE A MASHUP WITH NIKI "EVERY SUMMERTIME"
Did Anderson Paak just died? 😅😅
I don't know how many people have complained to me about their lives with cigarettes in their hand exactly like that lmaoooooooo
They went from “leaving the door open” to “don’t let the door hitcha, where the good LORD splitcha” and I’m here for it!! ❤️❤️❤️  #ISSABOPE
Bruno and Anderson did something no one else could. This song + video so good, there is no negativity in a YouTube comment section.
Bruno's head voice is 💯👌
I wonder what 10,000 people didn’t like about this song 🤔
Bruno done catching a grenade for her ,he is now throwing it to her face😂😂😂😂
This man CANT make a bad song
This man said kids running around the house like its Chucky Cheese....😭😭😭 #Bars
Haven't seen a great r&b team since the temptations and 5 heartbeats
Yo. I am here…. 🥀
🔥💜🔥
Chocolate buttah❤️‍🔥
This is sick. The style is classic 🔥🔥💯
Love it!
Eu realmente amo o Bruno ele é impecável em seus trabalhos
"not to be dramatic" *proceeds to lie on floor*
If this isn't a heart warming sad song.❤
Touring when?
who hurt this nigga like bro 1:37
Do they realize this motivates kids to grab a cigarette since they think it's cool when the celebrity singer does that!? What are these foolsthinking
Is RnB back?
This is great !!!!
Its the fact Pak laying on the floor like a homicide chalk out line, and then on que with "this b*tch" for me 😂😂😂
Bruno making timeless songs!!!!
Let's not act like Anderson ain't singing his butt off too
It's really 10 thousand people who didn't like this...wow!
Anderson’s transitions are so entertaining. When he comes in with his first verse the transition of him cutting in front of Bruno “This bitch got me” is so good. Then when he says he doesn’t want to be dramatic, but he wants to die then proceeds to fall & stay down on the floor while Bruno sings 😂
The way Anderson comes in! 😱😂 Sticking his head into the frame over Bruno.  "THIS!  BITCH!"  😆😆😆
From “ drippin in finesse” to “I got finessed”
GAAHHH IM SO GLAD THEY KEEP GIVING US THIS TYPE OF MUSIC <33 KEEP DOING IT!!
PELO AMOR DE DEUUUUUUSSSSSSS
0:46 what does LeBron James is doing there?
😍😍😍
She belongs to the CITYYYYYYYY!!! - silky ver.
Their balance is 👏🏾👏🏾😩😩🙌🏾🙌🏾 I’m waiting for the tour!
It be Anderson’s “this bitch” for me 😂 as well as his “Ohhh Nooo!” 👏🏾👏🏾
The "This Bitch" by Anderson killed it🤣🤣
My favorite song of this year or even, last 5 years
The same plastic you throw on the ground can go too the sea and be eaten by the same fish that’s been served on your plate,stop poisoning yourself and your loved ones ~use a thrash can ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely 🔥
Lord, please save the souls of the 11k people who disliked this video
It’s the fall and the stomp for me lol 😂
I haven't came across a music video AND it's song I can enjoy SIMULTANEOUSLY in years... until this. Thanks guys.
2 после маска илона
That Hercules line when Paak starts stomping his foot 😂😂 hits me every time
Old school with that RnB vibe, and current content. This is 🔥
More elaborate  "She belongss to the street"
Anderson got up fast asf
Omg this song is so lit ❤️❤️❤️
He has my heart ❤ he gets it every time with every song. He is the second-best 💖💖 right after MJ
Who else feeling this 1970s stuff much better than the demon in Travis Scott
The old school vibes.
How can people not love this song ?
OMG.....Just can't get enough of this song....SOOOOOO GOOOOOOD.....LOVE from Lisbon.....
火星哥真的好帅🥺太好听了这首歌
Now this is music!!!!!
No she belongs to her !  Funny boy !!!'

👏👏
bruno mars es mi idolooooo
They can't miss!
What on gods green EARTH? Did I just discover...
so funny!  love them
perfect suing
The way these guys are pure opposite, that’s why it feels so good Bruno: Furious/Angry/MAD Anderson: Sad/mellow/dramatic
She belongs to the streets the respectful version 💯 …….
Dis shit hard
He went from "catching a grenade for you"  To "catch it yourself bi***"
When he say this BITCH !!💀 💀💀🤣🤣🤣💯👈
the last romantic man died :( who broke Bruno's heart? now he's screaming at the moon
❤️🤗 I wanna see this live 🥺😭
THIS DUO IS PERFECT
Aye aye 🔥🔥
While I love this duo album and the vibe it brings this song his a miss for me.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
he looks like sammy davis jr a little bit
Um cigarro segurado perfeitamente,faz diferença
Just realized Bruno Mars is playing drums in the back while he leads the song. Legend
저만 그런가 볼수록 오방신과 어랑브루지 생각이 나네요 분명 다른 컨셉의 노래인데 ㅎㅎ
Is it just me getting a Backstreet Boys vibe from the chorus part?
The same video of drake ft migos now everybody copy that....
🔥🔥🔥
their choreography when they sing lam i'm proud❤️👍
Yoooooo! Did Kevin Samuels co-write this?   😂😂 This song is the-ish! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
welcome to the 70's
1:20 favorite part😍😍
the late 60s and 70s vibe!!!!!
An absolute dream old school meets new school meets comedy. **chef's kiss** **standing ovation**
Everything about this video is Gold: 1. The way it was videoed (props to the cameramen) 2. Anderson just popping on screen and doing the absolute most 😂. 3. The choreography. 4. The whole dramatic yet smooth vibe.  5. Everyone just enjoying themselves. I absolutely love it!!! Well done! 😊👏👏👏
Cool performance 😎🎼🎧
Vocals so crispy!!

BRUNO TE AMOOO
Came on as an ad, left it playing all the way through ; }
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender and so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah, woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me, please (Help me, please, help me, please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die   This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here   Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could you do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (One things fasho, one things fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong to) Yeah, she belong to everybody That girl there, she belong to everybody   (Oh, no) Look here, baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But, I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round bare foot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now, I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me   Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong) Yeah, she belong to everybody She belong to everybody Ooh
Whoever disliked this is probably an ex, or the ex's mommy😂😂😂
This song belongs to a Dave Chappelle skit
Oooh weeee! This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
It felt like the "the Greatest Showman" vibes at 1:16!
I have watched this genius of a masterpiece way too much its becoming too much. But still can't get enough ❤️
They are the shit....real music...always written relatable and real. No fake bling bling crap. They the realist artist around if u ask me. 💯
Joder como amo esta canción

Smart to make a song for rich divorced guys 😂
🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏👏❣ You guys are clowning off the phrase, "She belongs to the street". I'm laughing my ass off.
hey Bruno #Rwanda we've got your back
Bruno draws great ideas for his musical works, from the depths of his mind and soul, and above all, from deep love, for the woman of his heart, she is his inspiration and muse, Bruno has long been sighing to the woman of his heart, because it is her she gave him a deep affection and a thankful heart for his wonderful love.
THis was HIlarious😂
They really do exude Leo/Aquarius energy when they perform together. Love this duo

"She belong to the streets" the song.  Love it!
THE WAY ANDERSON JUST STAYED ON THE GROUND 💀
If I'm ever talked into doing Karaoke, This is the shit I'm putting on. Its so fire, not even I can fuck it up.
Who the back up singer on the left side though 👀👀
Silk Sonic never miss. This is gold.  Someone please pick up Anderson .Paak from the ground. My man be doing the most. lmao
in 1985 we had "easy lover" from phil collins & philip bailey, in 2021 we've got smokin out the window from silk sonic
Бруно, как всегда, на самой самой самой высоте!!! И Андерсон Пак!!! So cool!!!!!!!!
The way Bruno says the final lick of the song is so cool. The way he says she belong to everybody is just so cool. Can’t get over it
Who hurt Bruno again?
Brilliant. LMAO.  an amazing tune.
Didn’t love it out of the gate. 3 listens and im HOOKED. This may end up being my favorite song on the album.  Well, except for leave the door
I think I've seen the background before, uhm the kissing booth?
Just Think about those  brainless ten k  people who disliked this song 🙀😹
The making of modern day classic. Thanks for bringing back true soul music. Much appropriated.🤘🏿
I’ve been listening to this whole day long.
1:34
Just Think about those  brainless ten k  people who disliked this song 🙀😹
Nice song
Everything in this song is perfect, Thanks for the advertisement on tiktok lol! 😁
My man went from catching a grenade for you to throwing a grenade at you lol
I’m 60 and this is the best song I’ve heard in YEARS 😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️. If they come to Vegas I WILL BE GOING
This is the "she belongs to the streets" new anthem 😂😂😂😂
Hoodville taught em well 😂😂🔥🔥
Musta spent 35… 45  mins stirring up that Mac and cheese 🫕…. 😩 oooohhhh lawd
that was hit in my heart... he's genius more of as I expect.
This entire album is phenomenal. Holy shit. Every song a classic.
lmao Anderson has me dying XD
댓글 왠만하면 안다는데 이건 너무 좋다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
this  song  so  cool  BABE YEAH ＨＡＡ　um mm
My favorite song rite now
I am glad that I'm alive to witness this duo "THE SILK SONIC"
I love this new song Smoking Out The Window What awesome talent..and  of course another masterpiece...another beautiful song from  Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak....I am addicted...what class Bruno Mars and Anderson...masters....a grammy award winning song and video of the year ..it is just a matter of time..and the drama of the on stage collapse of  of Anderson .Paak.....he wanted to die...genius...
Who’s dis bitch they talkin?
Oh shit I looked up does Bruno Mars smoke? It says he's a heavy cigarette smoker. It's just weird because I'm a cigarette smoker I watched video he took one drag and didn't inhale. But why pretend? I wish I never did start smoking. All I'm saying is I'm lost I only listened to song because 20 year old co worker, I'm 39 but to me this is bs why is everyone holding a cigarette? When obviously they only took one drag and didn't inhale is this fake news??
she belong to the STREEETZ
Bruno looking like Ike turner 😅 the song a vibe though I love it
He’s voice never gets old
Before 1m likes
More cultural appropriation disguised as soulfulness 😂
1:17 was smooth
Song is good but why fake smoking? Wake up these singers don't smoke. I saw one pull by Bruno Mars he didn't inhale? Why not just smoke weed and inhale wouldn't that go better with song? I'm 39 maybe message went over my head. I do know how women are they fake they like me for free drinks so maybe fake cigarette smoke fake inhale, is the women and all the fake work they put in. Maybe someone young can give me answers.
The dance movies ❤️
This song right here is all mens  anthem from now on boy wait to the summertime get here especially when Bruno bring that verse this……. Every man need to purchase this
wowww this is amazing
Perfect example of why you don’t date someone with kids. Baggage be real heavy
Love the album my favourite song
Bruno looks like a young Dewayne Johnson
เยี่ยม
😍🔥❤️
Hella 🔥
Lord have Mercy this kind of music is a healing portion 💃👯‍♂️
If only you could press the like button more than once🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anderson remind me of David Ruffin from the Temptations.
se superando como sempre 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
😂😂😂
Anderson really popped off with this one. But trust me they both ate the WHOLE damn plate
Bruno Mars Supremacy yessss
This song is soooo good :)
Am I the only one who sees the fake Blood under Anderson on the floor? Lol. Hilarious.
Bruno. Just. Keeps. Bringing. It.
This lyrics is top tier hahaha
Bruno mars the next Michael jackson
Wouldnt want to be that bitch rn
Soul train never looked so good!
best song ever!
The drummer looks like bruno.
Switch to 240p for the full effect of Vintage music video.
She belong to everybody everybody "She belooongs to the streeeeets"
Damn this song kicks so much ass
All i see in my head is dave Chappelle. 😂😂😂😂
I so love these two... So glad the Album is finally out. Happy #NewMusicFridays people.
The collaboration I always knew I wanted but never realized.
Is it really necessary to curse in every song? we use to refer to our women as ladies now bitch is so common in today's society.
The lyrics got me laughing so much, great performance from Anderson and Bruno, as always
Whew, let's hope this catches on and sends Hip Hop and Rap to the scrap heap.
This confirm men's can be sexy
Bring back the sadboii bruno mars hahaha
노래 겁나좋다
very cool👍🔥
Why does this sound like a parody song?! Like they wrote it while making the video 🤔
These 2 are the shiiiiiiiiiiit
Motown will never die......
ขอถามได้ไหมคะ แฟนๆคนไทย เขาทำไง ทำไมไมค์ถึงไม่พันกัน
For me, the best performance, of any kind, is one where the performers are obviously having fun….totally in character, but somehow the fun comes through….perhaps in the perfection of the harmony or choreography. I kinda get the “edgier Motown” vibe….one note: lyrically, curse words are a crutch. Period. Walk tall.
DAMN WHO HURT THEM
the lean in when he says chuck e cheese lmaoooo
Didn't know Trae Young could sing
sheesss
good song but ditch the cigs in the video.  didn't even need them as a prop.
Temptation vibez
Props to Pete and Bernie for rearing and grooming the greatest, most talented and creative musician in modern times.  Their commitment to Bruno’s career was tireless and deftly calculated.  Great job Bruno.  Earl M. Washington “Jackie” from the Lovenotes.
Bring me back to the 60s. I belong there.
🙂🙃
Ladies, If they call you a Bi%cH..laugh at em, let the boys smoke by themselves
These guys are on another level. I can't wait for their album to drop.
Every song on this album is a masterpiece
Bruno mars is Goated 🐐🐐
this is how to smoke with style
Paak died because of child support😂🤣
I miss you Bruno .. you´re a treasure of 24k
...did we just step back into the 70s?
this song is both funny and catchy
sugar daddy theme song
this is the aftermath of leaving the door open
So this is Post Doonie Beatdown with shawty in the last song. A relationship was formed and now she taking advantage of the boy. That’s tuff 😂😂😂
"Got her bad ass kids runnin round my whole crib like it's chuck e cheese" 5 seconds in and I'm dead
Gives very much petty man energy and i love it!🥰
It’s Anderson falling the floor and popping back up for me 😂😂😂
Anderson "dying"  on the floor is hilarious BUT his returns on his verses are gold!!!
These niggas born different
SINCE BILLIONAIRE SONG TO THIS ALBUM BEEN BRUNO MARS FOREVER ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
bruno mars only has black friends
Bare foot in these streets 🤣
Okay Mr. Paak being dramatic, honestly one of my favorite parts in the song. I love the vocals 😍
This calls back to a golden era in soul while shaping itself it's own identity. The showmanship alone is in a class of it's own.
Hey
Bruno for a second reminded me on Tony stark if he could sing
If she got em payin' her rent and payin' for trips and here he is all alone? ...than I believe the title of "Dis Bitch" is accurate 🧐
Man went from catching grenades to throwing them
Screaming “HERCULES” (hercules, hercules) 🗣🗣🗣
Barefoot In These Streets 😂
That train must’ve hurt cause the way he emphasized this “b” is too much 😂
I'm not gonna lie, I didn't use to fuck with AP because it felt like he was in the wrong genre. Silk Sonic has me seeing this man differently. He right where he need to be rn
PJ Washingtons theme song
Leave the door open Now smokin out the window
When Paak rose out the blood singing, I’m like ok he back! 😳🤣🤣🤣🤣🤩
Ey ey ey
Wow. This is really good!
I can’t see how this got any 👎🏽. People can feel how they wanna feel in reality, but in reality this WHOLE ALBUM IS CLASSIC!    BTW Thx for bringing back a legend! ❤️ ✌🏽 and spring 💧
The way these two let each other shine is a beautiful thing the see. Nothing but love and respect. 🙏
Have to admit that they really make a great songs as a duo.
I'd love to meet the 10k "special" people who disliked this video.
Hope they do more songs together.  This song is fire. I dont to be in love like that any time soon LOL
Seeing #1 in music it makes me so happy
1:43 ninoy after leaving the plane
Can't believe I'm discovering this collaboration now...both these guys bringing back the 70s like a motherfucker
Bruno finally come to his senses and threw the grenade back😂😂😂😂 Anderson must've talk some sense into him .....talkin bout he catches grenades😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love the music but *don't smoke* .
Reminds me of Motown classics in a twisted way!!
oh my, this album is just heavenly
What the hell year is it? Don’t even know anymore
I, and I can't emphasize this enough, love everything about this song and video.
Love this video🦋
I can’t decide my favorite part of this song. The boldness is them saying “this bitch” or Anderson saying not to be dramatic, he wants to die, and falls the fuxk out! Lol! Definitely Anderson. *replays video
This shit sounds like the music my grandmother and mother used to listen 🎶 too fr fr 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My dad used to listen to this gold when I was a kid. Like 20 years ago.
AotY already.
Went from catching grenades to throwing them
Stay toxic fellas. This the new anthem 😂😂😂
The AlBUM is Dopeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Again a good one!
😩💥
🖤
I guess Anderson trying to find the window. On the floor.
1:30
Anderson Paak's "this bitch... but i want to die" has me rolling so hard right now. i haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Yall so fucking talented. When is the tour?????????
This joint is brilliant yet, funny AF for the times... This song it self, the lyrics, and every word in it is brilliant down to the letter!! A legendary song that will be a classic Also, the comments had me in tears from laughing so hard
“ This bitch “ is everything 🔥
hi youtube I thought this video and song of Bruno Mars and Sonic Silk was alright,
It's the dance for me
1:51 Anderson's move there was straight up smooth
me: did this man actually die? what th...oh
Bruno bringing back the 70's when smokin use to be cool... still love the music vibe.
Grinned through the entire video. Absolutely genius 👏 🙌 👌
Here we go again😌❤️
This should be on SNL.
Anderson. Paak is so good!! I love him!!
Mucho tema,
I am speechless. They are a FORCE!
What a song 😂🔥🔥❤
I swear YouTube just said fuck weeks we going with days now
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Every song you guys make together best songs of 2021 and that's a fact
Don't stop making music together please 😍😍😍😍😍😍
This music video is FANTASTIC
1:36
Anderson on the floor like he’s dead. 🤣
The lyrics and creativity on this video is everything 🙌🏾  Bruno and Anderson thank you for bringing back the vibes in music 🎶

Wow! it matches the vibe!
Waoh♥♥
💜💜💜💜
Please keep this style going
The saviors of music..
This whole joint was smooth as hell... Dang!! Bring back that 80's Vibe I'm loving it...❤
That Anderson Paak playing dead on the floor and the PERFECTLY TIMED Pop Up afterwards awaking from the dead!!!!!!!  Doesn’t get any better than that right there. Silk sonic needs to be in more tracks!!!
Album of the year💯💯💯

The fact that nobody cared that he died and kept right on singing is hilarious
Anderson Park put a signature on this video playing dead and than popping up! Silk Sonic is just 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anderson .Paak is a gifted singer. Seriously, what a smooth voice.

I've never seen Bruno show so much skin before.  Not even in the Gorilla video🤣
No matter how much bruno switches up he never switches up on us as fans ! Thank you ❤
Silk Sonic is bringing back. Be listening to this on the holidays.
Smooth on my way to work😎😎😎😎
1:37: Bruno went from I’d catch a grenade to duck and cover bish
Harks back to old Motown...love it
It seems like someone didn’t listen to Big Boi on the International players anthem

THIS IS MY NEW ANTHEM MY BF OF 1 YEAR BROKE UP WITH ME AFTER EVERYTHING I DID FOR HIM AND WENT TO MY BEST FRIEND 🤬
the fact that this comes right after "after last night" makes this a little sad
The best song ever recorded. This is amazing!   Greetings from The Netherlands
Y'all loving the dramatic and I'm gonna die but I'm tripping off him popping up infuriating Bruno talking about smoking out the window
The weekend, Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake together are amazings.
is this some kind of cigarette  ads ? which brand ?
My toddler loves the product placement for Chuck E. Cheese!
esse homem nunca erra
I don't care what is on the Billboard.....this is absolute fire!
Friend: whats the matter Me: 1:37
this song is so fucking good !! ✨🛐🚬
That was some feel good 3mins of my life
This is Drippy
I’m addicted to this. That is all, thank you for your time
i approve !!! get dojo in this lol it would beat slap and fall over
Anderson goofy ass plays too much lmaoo
U r the one living in 90s
The fact that it sounds good makes it even more hilarious 😂
This is music. Love , happiness, laughter. Straight fire!!
this give me chills🔥
This is reaching at that Michael Jackson level of pop crazy
These guys are nothing short of genius! I'm loving everything they do...respect to Motown!..I'm 63....
Silk Sonic is bringing the 70s and maybe the 80s back
It's funny when they say this bitch got me paying the rent
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He went from "Count on Me" to "Count me Out"
Ive been playing it every night😂😂
Damn what’s smoother than silk ? 😂
the way Bruno Mars hits the "This BITCH"  after Paak dies 🔥🔥🔥
Finally, some good modern pop music.
Enjoying the music when in Kenya,cant get enough of it.
DRILLING HER FROM THE BACK WHILST BRAIDING HER HAIR
I’m FuckiING VIBING to this shit
That's the Temptations in 2021
Bruno really threw the grenade back
Nice.
They snapped 😭
That. Foot work. I could listen to them all day—this is REAL music. KEEP IT REAL, Y’ALL!!!
No 😤I’m not belong to everybody 😂🤣😂😅only you 😘❤️🇩🇯🇩🇯
@0:32 Whaaaaht?!? 😭🤣😆
Sinong naperahan sakanila. HAHA
Alta frescura me encantaa demasiado temazo 😎😁🤤
I know its probably just me but Bruno Mars kills the vibe for me. Anderson Paak could have done this himself and killed it. The vibe fits better. When you see Bruno I just shake my damn head lol
I know you guys are here for 0:32
1:44 WHY IS HE ON THE FLOOR 😭😭😭😭😭
And yet again another song that's gonna go number one 🔥🔥🔥💎💎💎🎼🎼🎼

Let's appreciate the choreography 😭😭😭😭
😂😂😂😂
this is the most smoothest way to tell a girl that she belongs to the street.........................
Hell yeah!! Bring us back Bruno! Loving the whole album!!
This shit is fire 🔥
The title is a real world description of relationships. Before listening to the song I knew what it would be about based on the title. These guys have to be the supergroup of the 21st c. or at least the pandemic 💪❤️🎶😎😂
Quick question. Why Americans have a highest divorce rate? Is cheating common thing in America? I mean 3out of 5 parents divorce for whatever reason.
Is anyone else intrigued to know what caused this collab and the story behind it ? This music will be a classic one day and I’m happy it’s in my generation
Ohhhh 🥵🥵😫😫👌👌👌💎💎💎💎
Dude went from catching grenades for bitches to throwing em back at em . Lmao
Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo
Well it's safe to say everything that bruno Mars does blows up to 100%%%  he is literally top 5 r&b,pop of all time
Now the music awards caught their attention
80s Babies Represent. Cool Song and Smooth Vibes. They Definitely Respect The Craft and Paying Homage to the Old School. Salute Kings
😻 I love it
When Leave The Door Open first was released I told everyone in the videos comment section these guys are making music History, they have the ears of the older generation and the younger generation at the same time and that is not easy to do as a artist musician. I am inspired to rethink my strategy because real musicianship is back with a new twist on some grown folks respectability level.
Bruno giving me Sammy Davis JR vibes & I love it
Watching bruno mars in this video reminds me of Sammy Davis jr.
My new fav song! Omg he just dropped his new album and it’s amazing!!❤️❤️🤩🤩🤩👌👌 we all needed this! 😍😍
2013: Let me treasure you 2021: This bitch got me paying  Lol =))))
That was drop dead hilarious
0:31
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
that sound , .wow!!!!that's a sound we don't hear in music these days ,
Omg 😱 wrold 123✍🏼 number best
Bruno Mars, please stop taking drugs. Even if you say you're not into it, it's obvious that there are too many drugs inside your veins. Look at your face in the mirror, dude.
THE CHOREOGRAPHY. THE DANCING. THE SYNC. THE VOICES DRIPPING WITH HONEY.
I’m really looking forward to the live performance of this song
I absolutely love simplicity!!💜🥰
No way thats bruno
Te amooooo
This song needs Adam Levine
Did I get the lyric wrong or what? It's not Bruno Mars done simping it just he's annoyed he's still simping right?😂
If "she belongs to the streets" was a song
I love you
Credo que delicia
10000000/10
"like its chucky cheese" 💀
So grateful for this type of soul music with the video to go with it!! 💨 🪟 I know exactly what this means #GrownFolkMusic
WHO PISS THEM OFF
AHHHH I KEEP REFRESHING SPOTIFY TO LISTEN TO THE ALBUM LEMME LISTEN LEMME LISTEN
This is a jewel.
I will never say THIS B***H regular again💯🤞🏾😩♥️
that's cool 555+
"I hope you find whatever it is you need, but I also hope that your triflin ass is walking barefoot in these streets."  Greatest sweet line with a dash of salt. Might as well throw it on the grill too 😊
Damn smooth sadness
Just wow it’s magic
I'm really gone enjoy this album!
He had me at Chucky Cheese,I never laughed so damn hard.. The fall on the ground took me out🤣🤣🤣
Its incredible how silk sonic songs increase my serotonin
It was cool until you said B**** 🤦
To the simps out there. That bitch ain't worth you constantly smoking out the window. Be strong and cut her out.
Another one! How they make something funny sound so soulful real artistry . “This bitch”
Solo puedo escribir TEMAZO
Wait? we can use emojis now? my god😂😂😂
"now I gotta give you back to the city"kills me Everytime
Love the whole Temptations vibe...
The song gives me goosebumps
This playing through Lexicon 💯
Heard the album? 10/10 🥵
Only Silk Sonic can tell a chick that she's rated E for everyone and make it sound amazing.
Absolutely love the era they choose! You can still look classy while talking shit.
This exactly what my generation been missing
This shit is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sweet 💯
Good Music everything they make a hit ,,, Finally a different vibe from all this trash played daily...
To the Streets!
U gotta admit this song is such a masterpiece  My shoulders and feet can't stop vibing to this especially the  "Smoking out the window " is soooo sooothing !
It's been a while since I heard a guys that can put out one hit after another. 🔥😍
This is too much smoothness for my screen
"Cause she from the STREETS"
My least favorite of the first two but it's still a smooth af song.
they threw her back where she belonged  TO THE STREETS 😂😂
i like it:)
This song legendary 🔥
Incredible Man
That 's alright good professional 🚀🚀🚀🌌🌌🌌👍👍👍👏👏👏
una canción triste no te puede poner feliz la canción:
I wasn't expecting the "this bitch  got me..." funny AF 😂😂😂😂 But they are smooth ❤️
This is a classic. IDC. So smooth
Honestly Bruno Mars can say or do what ever he wants he's bruno😂
Smooth!
the drums sound so sharp!
Bring it back baby! Bring it back!!!🥂😇🤑💫🙏🏾🤝🏾🤝🏾💫💪🏾💪🏾❤❤👀🙏🏾👀 PLEASE 🙈
The best song of 2021
I am 66yrs old , this stuff takes me back to my high school days.  Great to see 70s soul making a come back
I love this song
The vibes this bring ❤️
Tanginang manga pinoy oh
So, nobody gonna say nothing about the Sammy Davis jr look alike?
Who else is here reading comments...waiting for the album to drop in 45 minutes! ❤💕❤
Everything about this is great, except, come on guys, lose the fake cigarettes because it’s a little cheesy 😂  I understand it goes with the title of the song, but damn…. 😂
This is actually a good song …
I'm lmao and jammin' out at the same time 💕🔥 Nice 😘😂
Makes me feel like it’s the old days, good music. Such a vibe.
The Weeknd
This gotta be the smoothest song/video I’ve ever seen
Bruno mars and anderson paak never failed to entertain me. This is so good!! 😩❤️
Berta Daily Top 10 11-12-2021 Top 9 Yesterday:9 Peak:9 Days:5
producer : anderson , just don't break the microphone  anderson :
I'm so happy with these people creating music that fits my style that I always wanted.
The content we come on here for
Natalie: This gold digging bitch Smokin Out the Window: This Bitch!   Bruno better keep that door closed 😂😂😂😂
AN EVENING WITH SILK SONIC IS OUT EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They are so damn good I just love them
I wasnt really a fan of Brunis, but Anderson Paak along with Bruno mars....perfect match.
The lyrics are so dumb.
Loving  what Bruno & the boys are doing these days - putting on a show as well as delivering good music!
In Brazil we call this kind of man "corno"
Smooth as silk, funny as f***!!
This song reminds me of why I love music.
DOpE I been there b4
My hero
🔥🔥🔥
Seu Madruga todim!
someone PLEASE ID Anderson Paak's sunglasses for me lol I need them like yesterday
Silk Sonic X BTS please.............!!!
Loving this lol all of the songs
Outstanding!!   From a 50 year old white guy!!  Talent Knows no color !!!
When I turn my BOOM BOX on with this song🔥☄️☄️☄️that BASS is a Killer….. I’m drowning with mad love for BRUNO and ANDERSON. I want too close my eyes and VIBE… but I can’t miss anything 😂😳🤣🥲🥲🥲BASS VIBE KILLING ME…. Ummm … ump  nasty with fire 👏🏼👏🏼POWER….💫✨✨✨🚬kills it 🥂🚬🥲✨🌊🤭🙈FUNNY ✅

This video is hilarious. And Bruno giving Sammy Davis Jr. vibes.
Muy bueno!! Muchas graciassss
This song is so good
This was a long ass Malboro commercial
The quality 😳 INSANE
They did that!!!! That was a great song and video!!!
1:33
🤣😂🤣😂 I love it!
Yessss....love 70s, 80s, early 90s music. This is real music
Chuky cheese 🧀
11 month ago💀
She belongs yo everybody 😄Horizon widely
GOATS
That triggered moment when she screaming Hercules 😂 the light plays well as the stomping grounds, i feel you brother 😂😂
Finally some good fucking music
1:37 my dad when he first meet my mom
dude this music is just... wow
I might be off but this shit seems like a parody of some of the greatest music every made.  It is cool but it seems like they are joking which makes me not dig it, where when I listen to the stuff they are ripping off, I feel like it is authentic.
The emphasis on "THIS BITCH" makes me feel like it's me, I am that bitch😂
10 out of 10. It would've been even more dope if they had a stage prop of a window for Anderson's talking part 🤣
OOOOOOHHHH! That’s SMOOOOTH! ☺️
Absolute greatness! I love it
Welcome back, this is not your first time here!!!
Not to be dramatic but I wanna die and falls to the floor love it
Luv it!
Mais algum brasileiro aqui nos  comentarios ? ???
Reminds me of good music from the 70s and 80s nice
This was Anderson Paak's time to shine his soul came outta of this one
YOU ARE ALIVEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IM CRYING!!!!!!! :v
I love the lyrics.
Bruno’s ✨ Bitch✨ was so crisp 😌
Nah, average
😂 Anderson Paak on that floor & got up with a quickness 😂
I love him passed out on the floe!!!!
Just so you know, I watched it 3 times.
Worst music I heard from you Bruno. Sorry you don't sing as good as before. Not your fan anymore👎
Amazing music.... keep it coming
The *She belongs to the streets* national anthem
Absolutely Love this song! Another great hit! Love that they are making music like this. They don’t get enough credit for their creativity and bringing back good music and videos! Also the dancing is amazing! On point with every move, that’s not easy
Would be better if they didn't call the woman a bitch. It's not okay for men to use it.
I can't stop listening to this jam, it's too short so I keep having to replay. It's perfect whether you're heads down at work or just crusin' the streets with the windows down.
Machucaram o coração do bruninho
I can SMELL this video
good
Outstanding Gentlemen!
This nicca done did it again....🎷🎶🎤🎼🪕🎸🥁🥇🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is a hit
This song is "SMOKIN"
SWING & SOUL.....this match is what makes black music ageless & everlasting.
When I tell you I’m obsessed 😍
These music videos are all masterpieces
The song so painful ahhhhh
Que perfeição de Músicaaaaa
😍😍😍
Just heard the album.....AOTY.....🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
tuyệt
Anderson took us to church, he tore this up!!!!!!
Bruno, that incredibly thin mustache is EVERYTHING my guy!! 👨🏻
So damn smooth! In every aspect. LOVE IT. ✨
All these dislike is from women because they know he right 😂😂😂
Motown Era Vibes  Love it
Si estoy de pie, no es por la fuerza de mis huesos, sino porque Cristo me sostiene. ❤️
THIS. BITCH. GOT ME PAYIN HER RENT PAYIN FOR TIPS DIAMONDS ON HER NECK DIAMONDS ON HER WRIST
Watching while 🚬...yeaaah
Even if this was released in the 70's , 80's , 90's or 2030 it would still sweep all of us away. The smoothness , comfort quality and rhythm is so amazing. I've always knows Bruno for producing top tier music but I didn't know with Anderson Paak would bring such a burst. I love you guys....your music will never expire
This song… this right here is the one
Instant classic!
Only Anderson and Bruno can make “THIS BITCH” sound expensive.
This song is the male version (and dare I say a better version with rhythm, harmony, and talent) of the Real Housewives franchise.  Bravo Silk Sonic!!  Lovin' the vibe!!
this is just "she's for the streets" by silk sonic tbh
Cant wait to play this in 2031 and call it oldschool
Bruno and Anderson Paak collaboration is giving me life. All the songs have been nothing short of amazing. 😍
"Look here baby, I hope you find whatever it is that you need but I also hope your triflin ass is walking around barefoot in these streets, lookout." 💀😆  Tell me you hood but tryna be right with the Lord without telling me you hood but tryna be right with the Lord...
Who in the world told these two to collab? And why did it take this long for this happen? I mean this is just too good!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Smooth 👌
Bruno Mars is of course Bruno Mars and will stand out next to almost anybody, but Anderson Paak holds is own with him!
Phenomenal New old flow sound! We need more music like this!
Loved it. And it gave me Sliders Rembrandt Brown Crying Man vibes. lol This should have way more up votes.
As an older, refined gentleman, I love the 70's early 80's vibe.
🔥
this is so good what-
Anderson looking like Junior Soprano!
These lyrics are hilarious 😂😂
Feel good muzac!!! Love it!!!!
From catching a granade for you to this b!tch, that's growth right there.
Cigarette companies approve this music video.
Anderson playing dead gets better the more I watch this.
The Weeknd: Let’s bring the 80’s back. Bruno Mars: Hold my 70’s
VMA WORTHY
Another Masterpiece that make me playing this song all time 🔥🔥🔥
:)
Dios esta canción me encantaaaaaaa
Song: She for the streets
1:36 He really stop talking to the moon and went to bed
🤣🤣🤣🤣 all sugar daddies out there wanna die... bc they're paying for rents, trips, jewelries, etc n still feeling cold 🥶 🤣🤣🤣 ok I'm done! 😆
This song is describing us girls who are bored, make a nigga fall in love, then boom, let go…… this is the nicest way to call us out…. And I’m ok with it
This song gon make me wanna smoke a cig and perform this at an rnb club 👏🏻🕺🏻
Mans really went from I’d catch a Grenade for ya to I’ll throw a grenade at ya.
Sekshooal 🍫
silk sonics music getting sexier and smoother as well as Anderson and Bruno's voice owimji
Yeah, I'd love it.
bruno no sabes pero t amo<3
Musica de calidad 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
It's a delicious to watch and listening their song
How can you not feel and love this old skool vibe?
bruno is TIRED
Bad Ass BeBe Kids 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Few more hours and the album's out!!!
You guys are making magic together
Not going to Anndersons Airbnb that one time will always be my biggest regret lmao
❤️❤️❤️
Those lyrics though,  ...  WHO HURT YOU!!
The stomping on Hercules. I need that part in it's own loop
Wow 🇧🇷
Silk Sonic is the best thing about 2021. Without them, this year will definitely suck more.
I was describing this video to the crew today and the first word I used to describe it was funny.
They missing one person, jmsn
I miss my great aunts.... reminds me of casanova by levert good old days
This reminds  me of forget you by cee lo
Whoever put a thumbs down on this got no soul
Straight 🔥
00:33 the cig butt hit ☠️☠️☠️😂
This reminds me of 'I saw you walking in the rain' by Oran 'Juice' Jones https://youtu.be/9dZW1C3neao. Both funny but Oran 'Juice' kills it at the end.
Bruno Mars like Michael jackson
Dope🔥🔥🔥🔥
Smoking while singing........hahahaha natural
lol
I love every song Silk Sonic puts out. His songs are so sexy, so hot. Causes to dance them alone, enjoying a glass of good wine. I love Bruno Mars!!
Got her bad ass kids running around my cribs like they at Chucky Cheese.  If that ain't the quote of the year!!
Anderson.Paak “this bitch” get me every time 😂😂😂
Vibin’ 👏
You wanna know how big this song? Simply type ‘s’ in the search bar.
This shit is fucking amazing
Am i the only one who likes “skate to me baby” than this?  I mean i like it but i think “Skate to me baby” is a master piece! Anyways both are sick! Awesome music from Silk Sonic!
love his group
Another song for  ALL YOU SIMPS OUT THERE !!!!  #StopSimpin #SimpsAnthem
Anybody else annoyed that we waited 8 months+ for the album jus to only get 9 songs? One of them a intro.
it's so .. good ༼ ༎ຶ ᆺ ༎ຶ༽
So glad to see REAL MUSIC again. Dump the electronica.
Ya casi sale OMG  💿🥰✨🔥
The rhyme and tune are too similar to the 24K album.
Damn Love u  brunoooooo damn damn you are artttt ♥♥♥♥

Lol Im 68....this is so dope. Do people still say this? Real music with melody ! Oh please bring this back!🙏💗😂
Bruno is so cute and so talented woooow his girlfriend is a really lucky woman!!!!!
For the streets... The Anthem
1:33 Directed by Black Dynamite
why does it feel like it’s 60fps but it’s not i’m so confused
Mahal Na Ata Kita Bruno Mars🥺❤️
Not walking barefoot in these streets 😂🤣😂
Parece o auge da motown incrível 🤩
we've came a long way since "Treasure" turns out that shit went south
this is good music! love it!
太喜欢啦！！！
Deym Hercules! What a beat 🔥
It's about a    b i t c h who left.
Silk Sonic is exactly what we need!!! The music videos an vibe SMACK everytime!!! Anderson Paak is dope I'm so glad he's getting his flowers now 🧡
Damn Bruno said " I gotta give u back to the city " not just the streets but the whole damn city
I can't stop playing this song lol
This is clean af
the silk sonic songs are so amplified by their music videos and their performances
Can I have those mic please🥰
💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
Something about Bruno Mars saying bitch hit differently
OMG!! I've been here all day <3
Bruno went from "ima leave the door open" to "I'm finna change the lock"
They did that.
THIS SONG 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anderson Paak’s speech at 2:23 💀💀💀💀😂
That’s what happens when you leave the door open, kids come running around like it’s Chuck E. Cheese 😂😅
Thank you Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak for bringing the 70s to this day.
That was amazing!
Sweet. I done found me some new dance moves for tonight.
This nigga really dropped on the floor 😭
https://youtu.be/DXndgeOSAxI
Increíble
Ok who are the 10k people that dislike this? This is hilarious!
That was fun...loved it fo sho! Tight
🔥
Slapping as always 👏👏👏 As someone who grew up loving, and still loving rock, you're one of my favorite artists.   Hell,  I love all music when it's good. Country, metal, alt, pop....but Bruno always lays its down. When it comes to your music, I have a total bromance.
Not one dislike so far
That's one strong cig
https://youtu.be/8y4O8oKGGTM
Another perfectly made perfection.. Love it ❤
well damn i guess belonging to the Streets ain't that bad if they gotta give her back to the CITY 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who hurt you, man?
Eu tô apaixonada por essa música 😍😍
What a minute🤣🤣🤣🤣 I gotta watch this again🤣🤣🤣🤣 Anderson done died on the ground for a whole minute then popped back up🤣🤣🤣🤣 ...y'all crazy🤣🤣🤣🤣best video ever
Anderson se robó el show con esa caída JAJAJAJAJAJA
bro i can smell the cigs through the screen
I love this, just so much fun and passion.
Bruno looks like chuy tha Mexican plug
Como queria ver isso de perto . São perfeitos
Thats funny MV
"This bitch got me paying the rent"😭😂😂😂😭
Anderson's head popping back in the screen kills me everyvtime. Great tune, the harmonies, dancing, these guys hit it every time.
Heard 20 seconds and knew already this was a banger
Anderson: “I can be Dramatic but I don’t wanna die” Anderson: *Stays Down on the Floor*
💜💜💜💜💜
“I hope yo trifling a$& is walking around bare foot in these streets”……… 😂 🤣🤣
This song is a hit it's like really good!! I listen to it like a billion times a day!!
This...b****...got ...me...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not as immediately hot as Leave the Door Open but it's def still a hit and a continuous break away from the trash of today's music 👏🏾
A simps anthem!
This song is sooo DOPE!!!!!!!!😍
😂😂😂😂🎉🎉
pure magic
Another masterpiece❤
So many funny parts to this song 😅, Bruno's part of "I gotta give her back to the ciiiityyy"cracked me up lol.
Você é demais ! Amo sua música !
Plz, make a Christmas album
This is fucking awesome
He went from “catch a grenade for you” to “throw the grenade at you” but this song slaps tho
Can't wait for the album to come out tomorrow
Great song ... like the old days 🥰
Damn that Bruno Mars!! Bruno and dem, done done it again!!! I love it!!!  ❤️ 🎶 ❤️
this song is sooooo addictive
Oh God, sad song but very easy...
เหมาะที่จะเปิดกับเทศกาลลอยกระทงที่ใกล้จะถึงนี้มาก จังหวะติงน่องหน้อย😁
I need a remix with Snoop Dogg on it 🔥
Best of Motown, modern group and all the sass.
Umh!! Just love it!!!!!
This song describes my ex wife to a tee
...it must have been that Drugz🤣
This is great and also hilarious. Buying expensive things for someone won't buy you their love. Something goes for parents. They think spoiling their kids will get their respect... Takes learning, teaching, humility, and not have a love for material things to gain love and respect.
Bringing back the oldie vibes
SILK SONIC IS SO BEAUTIFULLY OLD SCHOOL BUT STILL NEW "She belong to everybody" and "Give her back to the city" is the classiest way to say "shes a hoe and belongs to the streets" I cannot WAIT for more Silk Sonic music.
Anderson resurrecting from the dead and re entering the verse is the funniest thing ive seen in a while
This song made me laugh so hard i love myself 😂
these guys are so dope!
I hope your trifling ass is walking bare foot in these streets 👌🏻🤌🏻
WOOOOW
🤣🤣
Maluko essa música eh mt boa
Hilarious; but  soon to be a much deserved R&B Classic.  .Paak’s talents are written all over Silk Sonic’s songs as Bruno, with his unbelievable singing pipes, has acknowledged.
It's the black excellence for me.
Well I guess you better Leave the door open 😂😂😂
Chuck e 🧀!!!!🤣😂
Crazy how he went from saying he’ll jump in front of a train for a female to this lmaoo
Que duo mas sublime
que hermosa voz
I love and appreciate whoever gave Bruno Mars a chance. Big respect to this gem 💎.
temptation vibe
They on a different stratosphere at this point. On the road to greatness
NEW HEAT ALERT! 🔥🚨🔥🚨🔥   Craig Kong - Another Time   Is this 🗑 or 🔥?  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qoR4ZFa9adM&feature=youtu.be
Bro Anderson on the floor took me tf out 🤣🤣🤣 tht boy cold! Another banger from silk Sonic💯💯💯
“This Bit#️⃣#️⃣” has me 💀💀 every time! 🔥🔥🔥
Omg!!! I’m impressed !!!
U guys sure got me smiling in front of youtube! 😍😅😍 Ur music even got me smiling solo out in the streets as it plays on my phone! 😎🤩😎 how can this song do that!?
So in love with their vibe... would love to see them do something with snoop, andre 3000, badu
This song is so Playa! Damn! Bring that good music back! PLEASE!
https://youtu.be/UaeYzBryBdk🎧
https://youtu.be/UaeYzBryBdk🎧
At 2:03 you can here a mistake in the mixing process with Anderson's chopped "yeah"
This is dramatically beautiful.
Awwwwwww sheeeeeeeeiiiittttttt
i just want to know that ciggarete brand. it last too long
Música de verdad, no reguetón. ¡Gracias!
Well It is smooth,and in really feeling this
Ay this fye 🔥
This gives me christion vibes and i love it
Bruno really threw the grenade back💀
O arcanjo Bruno mars  e seus anjos musicais são mesmo de outro  planeta!! Amo sua existência Bruno  mars, sua voz, sua arte!  mesmo não sabendo que sou sua fã  e muito menos da minha existência!! Mas, mesmo assim me sinto feliz em viver na mesma era que você afinal temos quase a mesma idade!!
LMBO!!!!!! The part when he’s just laying on the floor. Poor guy! Girl has him stressed out lol. Love this song. One of my favorites🤣
Another one !!!  Its about new songs, new teeth new beginnings 🤣
Here's the lyrics you're looking for 😊   Wait a minute, this love started out so timid and so sweet But now she got me smokin’ out the window  Must’ve spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany’s (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin’ ’round my whole crib Like it’s Chuck E. Cheese (Woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can’t believe it (Can’t believe it) I’m in disbelief  This bitch got me payin’ her rent, payin’ for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I’m so cold, I’m so cold You got me out here  Smokin’ out the window (Smokin’ out the window) Singin’ “How could she do this to me?” (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong ‘Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin’ on me tight Screamin’ “Hercules” (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin’ for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin’ this? Why you doin’ this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin’ her rent, payin’ for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I’m so cold, I’m so cold You got me out here  Smokin’ out the window (Smokin’ out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin’ “How could she do this to me?” (How?) (How could you do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me (One things fasho, one things fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) ‘Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong to) Yeah, she belong to everybody That girl there, she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin’ ass is walkin’ ’round bare foot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain’t right here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin’ out the window Singin’ “How could she do this to me?” (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) ‘Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong) Yeah, she belong to everybody She belong to everybody Ooh
Anderson Paak had me from the first dramatic “ohhh noooo”
I love the 70s vibe
Ladies and gentlemen the eight-month tease is almost over I can't wait for the album to come out tomorrow🔥🔥
This song has Dave Chapelle energy
This feel like an SNL skit. 😬
This hit
The album is out. In my first listen to the last two tracks I've listened, (Fly as Me, After Last Night) I'm kinda underwhelmed a bit. It feels rushed and unpolished. Maybe I'll like them soon, but in the first listen, it doesn't make me vibe. I hope the next tracks will be much better. (This opinion will change probably 2 days later, and I will have a good impression that day 😄) have a good day
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇯🇲❤️
I wanna know if the staff was laughing while making this video
Shout out to everyone in the comments who mentioned Anderson as well!
This is super hilarious mannnnn! Anderson Paak & Bruno Mars are a great match! Their personalities are coming thru the song and music video! like whaaat???? ROFL  much needed comedy in these trying times, thanks for making me laugh!!
Damn they are smooth
So much energy from both singers, loving the vibe
Oh this song is hilarious🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😍😍😍😍
I was looking for any music to change ma mood and I GOT THIS! Dude you've made my day!!!
Nice, promotes cigarette smoking. All proceeds go to the American Cancer Foundation.
Anyone else excited for the album dropping tonight?
Dana White must be soo proud of his UFC being promoted via a Bruno Mars song eh? 😋😄 (dont mean it in a bad way but a good way! 😇 )
Good song ... but ... Here I am, can't figure out how Bruno Mars can be singing at the same time as playing the drums. And Anderson Paak is singing. I guess that's normal, but he ISN'T playing the drums, which isn't normal at all. Not smoking out the window ... at least right now. I promise.
lovinggggggggggggggggggggggg
Lol
From leave the door open to, ima close the door on your way out.
Reminds me of the beat from Justin Timberlake’s “Dick in a Box”.
nyanyi sambil smoking, tapi suara tetep amazing
y'all hear the inhale +exhale at the opening. genius
I guess this is what happens after you leave the door open
Anderson .Paak still holdin that cigarette up while lying on the floor xD
Lmao
When Anderson Paak verse came on with the hurcules and the stomps afterwards I had to get up and do my little two step🤣🤣🤣
yo, bruno looks good af in this
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I am loving this genera.
Never heard the song that feel soo expensive ✨✨✨✨
Isn’t smoking bad for your vocal cords? Not for Bruno.
Simply want the back up singers!!!
Can you put taking to moon and smoked out the window together
thank's Bruno absolutely fire fireworks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🚒
"She belongs to everybody" is the nicest way to call someone a whore that I've ever seen lmao
Got her bad ass kids running my crib like it's Chuck E. Chesse!!!  Hilarious 😄😄😄😄
The singing is immaculate but I can't take a damn thing in this video seriously xD
I think it will be the best album in absolute in this century!!! Big big big Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak together
I fucking love Lenny Kravitz
Bruno Mars and Anderson. Paak are two of the swaggiest sexy men alive.
I swear their cigarettes are super glued to their fingers
i absolutely love this. hahahahah
Got to play it again!!!
I love these guys individually and together. They’re beyond this world fabulous! And so freakin funny!❤️❤️❤️
HE NEVER MISS 🥶🥶🥶
2:22 reminds me of a moment in jimmy fallons "idiot boyfriend".
"This bitch!!!!" 😄😄😄😄😄 Got me smoking out the window!!!  Love it!!! So funny!!!
Put out the album!!!
This video really cheered me up today. What a breath of fresh air this was compared to the usual ****. I am so grateful to these guys and the band [can't forget about the band] for bringing some 70's soul into the 21st century.  So damned good!
these guys keep putting out bangers I do admit
Choreography: from Cholly Atkins to Phil Tayag!  That signature shoulder sway!
I love Bruno Mars, he is so groovy, so unique. To me, the modern day Michael Jackson.   The industry needs You ♡
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)  You’re welcome ;)

Damn I love this band they got my old soul groovin thank you brothas thank yooooouuuu!!!!
1:44 my man quite literally die
I Really Love This Song !!! But This Is Definitely The Sugar Daddy’s Anthem Right Here 😂😂😂
I've seen several posts saying that men should not expect anything from women just because they give them money.  I agree, however, lets get real there are women and men who only get into relationships for what they can get out of it (sex/money/attention etc.). I’m a woman who has a son, grandson, godson, & granddaughters. I tell the males they should avoid relationships with women who only want what they can give them and don't value them for themselves alone. I tell my granddaughters (although they’re still young) that their bodies are sacred & not to be given away just to acquire possessions &/or money or to simply attract or keep a male's interest.    IF SOMETHING IS NOT FOR SALE IT CAN’T BE BOUGHT!
Isso que é música boa!
And another History is made. Love you smokin Bruno
What a wholehearted faithful committment to the genre and time period this song and video represents! Bruno's direction is right on point, especially the visual of their smoking on screen, which was common in the 60's. Even Bruno's look reminds me of Sammy Davis Jr. The sound is the perfect marriage of Philly International and Motown, the look is pure Motown, and vocally evokes the Temps, Delfonics and Bobby Womac mixed with Maxwell and Prince. Masterful and addictive...
Love this song ❤🌟  I ❤ you Bruno Mars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟😍😍😍
WOW!!!! THIS  SOUNDS SO,   DAMN GOOD ,AND TO TOP IT OFF MR. BOOTSY COLLINS  SMOOTH TALKING A$$, BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES OF  MY PAST, THANK YOU, AND PLEASE KEEP THIS GOOD MUSIC  COMMING
Almost positive it can't get better but, I can't wait until they perform this live.
Cocaine do one hell of a music
Their album🔥
Me a happily married woman with furry children “BAD ASS CHILDREN RUNNING AROUND MY WHOLE CRIB LIKE ITS CHUCK E. CHEESE” 🙋🏽‍♀️🕺🙋🏽‍♀️🕺🙋🏽‍♀️🕺
Whatever happened to catching them Grenades for her
Tictok  brought me.hear and im.hooked to.these song 🎵👌♥November 11..2021 Thursday.....
My man dropped to the floor with a lit cigarette.
Bruno went from catching grenades to straight throwing grenades 😂
1:37 Really good, I love it
This song the video the choreography is just immaculate!
I thought I was just gonna stay for the first 30 secs but ggggg that first verse compelling asf!! 👀🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥
"This bitch got me payin her rent, payin for trips, diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists" Verse of year <3
These guys really can make a song about ANYTHING sound sexy. This ish right here is the best thing since sliced bread. Forget what anybody else says. This song and video was EVERYTHING AND MORE!!!!
I’m totally here for this when this album comes out on a vinyl if it does🥰
That's why woman are saying "I'm that Bitch" because men don't respect them.
Who broke it?
Future Classic
Full package song..
I'm gonna take a jaywalking ticket & say this will be the Album Of The Year(sssssss)!!!
This the most PIMPALACTIC TRACK OF 2021 lol
A modern classic!
https://youtu.be/grNdrUpg4Ng
Yo if I could wish for anything I would wish to be as smooth as these niggas
Love me some Bruno and definitely this Collab 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This got that sweet ol school vibe, sounds amazing.
This man on the damn floor lol
Soul Train vibes with a twist
I love how cool Bruno in the background hahaha love you baby
This is Music!
Why they play so much Bruh? This bit a bop tho 😂
Smooooooth
https://youtu.be/vTgX3Bwm2RM
soul is still alive! 💖
This video and song.
Drop the album already!
"Hooker, bitch and ho, I don't think so I only knew one and never told her though I thought about it many times (Diss me?) That's the kind of shit to make you check your mind" Prince 'Days of Wild'
no one will ever flick a cigarette as smoothly as Anderson Paak 😂
Guys seriously who broke Bruno’s heart 😭😭
If they don’t win an award for best music video of 2021, then I’m going to do exactly what Anderson .Paak did and be dramatic about it
Ahhh I see ya, doing the Jackson 5 shimmy  at the end. I see y'all! 🤣😂🤣😅🤣🤣😂😅❤🧡💛💚💙🤎🤎🖤🤍
Will Smith should've hoped on this song
"Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist" that sounds so good wtf
Bruno Mars hold the record for making the best music ever
Now all of a sudden everybody a Anderson paak fan, I been on the train since Malibu
🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
background singer dancers: a snack
Go bruno and anderson
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣...yall hilarious
from "I would take a grenade for you and That's What I like" to this XD
Anderson on the floor got me- 😭🤚
these 3 songs: SKATE, leave the door open, and smoking out the window is all about one woman and the progression of a relationship
Yeah u pay her stuffs it should be me u are going to treat that way
This music is going to be listened to for a long time. I’m so excited for the album tomorrow!
Bruno went from "When I was your man" to "Back when I give a damn"
unironically goated music video
So I’m guessing “ I’ll catch a grenade for you is out the window” 😭😂😂🤚🏻
Cigarette will kill you. So will Bruno’s charm.
Bruno went from catching the grenade to throwing the grenade
That fool died than came back to sing a verse LOL
"she belongs to the streets," is a song!!!
BrunoGOD 🔥🥵
Bruno Mars, not the second Michael jackson, the first Bruno Mars
This is so SMOOTH! ✨✨
I love this
Hazme un hijo
Soy tu fan Bruno mars
They definitely listened to Future,  toxic asf LMAOO
Fantastic. I love this
So groovy
This a bop bro 😂🥳
Bruno ain't catching anymore grenades
We women have so many songs about men who wronged them, sometimes men need a song for the women who done them wrong! might as well make it sound like this! I am ok with it!
I thought that was Sid the Kid, but it was not...it was Bruno.
Bro Bruno said that in CAPS….
Bruno kneeling IS the same high as standing😂😂😂
Iconic
When Bruno Mars had to give her back to the CITY... 💀💀💀💀💀 even the streets wasnt ready!! Lolol
I love their art BUT IT'S 2021 and we gotta understand that WOMEN DO NOT OWE ANYTHING TO MEN JUST BECAUSE THEY SPEND MONEY! We are HUMAN BEINGS not a fuck!ng investment! So, my beloved Bruno, di3 alone in the cold because that 'bitch' does not owe you NOTHING!
I love🥰😍
NUNCA DECEPCIONA
This song makes me wanna wear a suit
Went from “catch a grenade for ya” to “nah bitch u catch it” 😭
*Template to send at someone or as a troll:*  This bitch 1 : https://youtu.be/GG7fLOmlhYg?t=32  chillin : https://youtu.be/GG7fLOmlhYg?t=46  This bitch 2 : https://youtu.be/GG7fLOmlhYg?t=96  Proper way to say sorry : https://youtu.be/GG7fLOmlhYg?t=127  Oh no : https://youtu.be/GG7fLOmlhYg?t=140  How : https://youtu.be/GG7fLOmlhYg?t=168

just the song to relate to my vibe rn
This one goes out to you hannah mae
uauuuuuuu
Since this song debuted I haven't missed one day listening to it.  Love it.
😂🤣
Thanks Bruno,  i'm going home and make love to my husband hearing this song <3
This song is the she belongs to the street anthem😂😂😂😂
Cigarette is the baddest thing of the world
Bruno’s ‘This bitch’ is full of conviction. You can almost feel he was extremely disgusted or felt used and abused. Pure genius!
Bruno said bitch with a capital b, My boy ain't simping anymore
I work for Sony  bmg
It is about the music
Nothing like confirmation
Can't wait for the album at midnight!!!!
It gives me The Jackson Five vibe!! Really digging this song!!
7 hours til the album comes out. Can’t wait!!!
This song is 🔥🔥🔥 A remix with CeeLo Green would go hard!
Lovin the look of the video. It's like going back in time with the brown suits, glasses and the ciggi in hand. 👍
Awesome as usual 😍 😍
"Ha ha" to infinity and beyond!  Best laugh of the century!!! 😂
The vintage sound and visuals are incredible. These guys are extremely talented. They master their craft.
woow il love
This has Commodores, Temptations, and Miracles vibes and I'm here for it 🙌 👏
The Best Part : Bruno Mars on His knees, then standing up so elegantly...
I feel like Dave Chapelle could have wrote this song
GUSSTOSA PÁA KARALIUMMM, CLIP PERFEITO AAAAAAA 🏳️‍🌈🥰🥰🥰🥰🇧🇷
Anderson Paak out here looking like a young Redd Foxx
My ex gonna hear this song for sure
Lembrei do Jackson five kkkkk
gg bruno
Love the old school sound Bruno brings just don’t like the cussing in his songs.
Took us back to the Temptations 💕
This hits different after Astroworld
Went from catching grenades to throwing them 😂
THIS IS EVERYTHING . Them lyrics speaking facts about how people like us who love hard respond to someone who isn't really emotionally available or loving like us and we witness the real them show themselves before our eyes. BUT ON ANOTHER NOTE THIS IS FUNNY AS FIZZUCKKKKKKK LMAOOOO I LOVE IT
Trop drôle ! J'adore !!!!!
TELL HER BRUNOOOOOO
Anderson Paak is me af 😂 Just dramatic! 😩

https://youtu.be/PLNjcundWqs
Another Classic
I’m really excited to see what this album does for Anderson Paak and his career. He’s been slept on for so long!!!
I love the infusion of old and current R&B soul music. From the dance moves, outfits, melody, lyrics it's all humor and good VIBES!
https://youtube.com/shorts/6A3jmXV5B10?feature=share
Paak laying jus kills me💀💀
Eror https://www.youtube.com/c/Mashinatory/featured
This is why you have to be careful about leaving the door open -- you might end up needing to leave the window cracked, too! Brilliant track, looking forward to the rest of the album!
Best thing that happened to the world lately

Too smooth,that’s how you talk shit and it gets a pass 😂😂😂
Best ever!
🤣🤣 love it! Don't know why it reminded me of the Jacksons- looking through the window
This a good song, but the homie Bruno looks like The Weeknd's left overs lmao, and Anderson Paak looks like he's bout to pull those pants up and ask someone "whatchu know about this" 😂
This is just raw FIRE!!! Congrats on the #1 trending. Well deserved!
Stepdad anthem 😂😂😂
He really said “ got her bad ass kids running around my house like it’s Chuck E. Cheese “ 🤣🤣
At 1:17 I knew this was gon be on just dance 2021 or something close to that
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruno aint catching grenades for no one now
Bruno is the modern day Morris Day!! Guess Silk Sonic is The Time!!
All I  can say is, HILARIOUS 🤣🤣
Love this😂😂!!!
I'm a Bruno Mars fan, but people are getting on my nerves ignoring Anderson Paak like he ain't bringing a whole vibe to each and every song. Please give this man his props.
i can’t stop listening 😭😭🖤
Man, Silk Sonic é uma fábrica de hits! Um abraço do Brasil :)
I can't stand how wicked good Paak & Mars are together.
Well, smoking is absolutely out theses days, but the music brings back Motown feeling... Yeah!!!
they crack me up, having so much fun
Him on the ground has me rolling bro
He said that with a capital B
Bravo 👏
When Anderson said " this bitch" he reminded me of my homie when he got triggered from a chick when he was trying to get her number 🤣
Love the music and all your videos I followed you when you first came out great job you are doing
Get out of satan system and get in God system before its to late people claim they love God and want to heaven but lifestyle heart mind mouth lyrics and soul says satan and hell ⏳
😂😂😂 GREAT SONG. It made my day. 😂😂😂
We all know BRUNO is a man of multitalented beyond belief. One of those gifts includes his “Annunciation “…..of words. CRISP,, Pristine absolutely flawless. I’ve never subscribed to 🤣 the word “ B***H  joking or other wise. When Bruno said it I died laughing beyond belief 😂🤣🤭🤭☄️🔥🔥I could feel it, see it, hear it and see his lips clearly forming to say it. Lmbo I’ve NEVER heard anyone pronounce. “WITCH”🤭 BETTER THAN BRUNO. I thought I actually saw who he was referring to! OMGeeee🚬🚬🚬☄️ , Anderson imitation of HERCULES was fire and on point. You could literally hear his foot stomping…. This song is Spectacular and I’m loving ever moment of it. All I want for Christmas is to have a Purple Ribbon around that entire STAGE🙈😂😂😂including performers and present it to me. CONGRATS to every aspect of the song of the Year ! 👏🏼👏🏼💫🥂🙈🔥🔥🔥🥳👏🏼👏🏼
What the fuck this some shit😂😂😂😂😂😂
The only time I’ll find dudes with cigarettes attractive
this song finna have everybody say "this bitch" again, everything bout the song is amazing
I can’t with this video 😂😂😂😂😂
I don't know about you, but this video came right on time.
Anderson Paak laying on the floor 😂😂😂
Bruno !!!! Ídolo!!!!!!!!
bu sporu yapıyorlar olum ya
My dad to my mom for the last 14 years of their abusive relationship:
I love Bruno’s combination of old and new not only in his music but his fashion
I've been listening to this song now for like 2 days and just now got that Bruno said she got him in a jam w her ex man who was in the UFC damn that's a bad af situation to be in
THE BEST DUO!!!
Ang lamig sa tenga grabe talaga boses ni bruno mars legendary 😍
I’m never gonna stop playing this now
I just love this so much
Bruno Mars really threw the grenade back with this one
Dis make me feel good😉
1:51 YOU SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME! 😂😂😂
perfeitos
This is a hit on every level for me! They nailed the 70s/80s "Solid Gold" vibe, and the Olan Mills signature "double exposure" illusion at 2:21 sent me over the edge! 🤣
How can i just leave the door open while smokin out the window 🤦🏽
Damn you two are Fucking Amazing, this is Great Again!
I must have watched this 100 times since it was first uploaded
Bruno is done catching a grenade for a bitch😂
🇧🇷🕺🕺🕺👍🙏😇🇧🇷🇧🇷🕺🕺🕺
This is the greatest thing ever…
Bruno is always a star for me!
The video is so simple, no chains neither nude 💯
Who is with me, "Bruno Mars songs are all so damn unique". So damn comforting.
This guy is just making classics 🔥🔥🔥
They’ve done it again 🔥🔥🔥
❤BM!!
1:50 Anderson. Paak is incroyable. I really love his voice 💛
This is the old school way of saying "she's for the streets".
These guys are just TOO MUCH!!! I love seeing the vintage gear...drop another smoker while being funny as hell! And let's not forget about BOOTSY, baba!! All aces!!!!!!!
Fuck, this song is so heavenly  Fr Bruno is a mood ❤️
So this is what crack sounds like.
Ho--- how??😲
These guys just giving us back the soft beautiful glory of the 80s. Amazing 😀
Straight:::::: FIRE!!!!
Damn in the almost end the just diss someone this song is sooo good
who hurt you
I used to listen to this back in the 60s. A Message to Future Generations, Don't let this song die. It's November 2021, let's see how many legends are listening to this masterpiece <3
Bruno went from "i'd catch a grenade for ya" to throwin the grenades back
It’s the way he lowered himself to the ground for me 😂😂😂
This is a fucking  classic
"She belongs to the Streets!"
"This .... bitch" 🔥🔥🔥 ♥️♥️♥️
Silk Sonic got me in my feels playing this song on repeat for over an hour so far 😿 So glad YouTube disabled the dislike button 🤗
This is an everyday mood . I will play this every morning now 😂😭🙌🏽 they spoke about everything we thought about but never said aloud
"God is real. God loves you. God wants the best for you. Believe that. I do."  Chris Pratt
I NEED this Album on CD...yes CD.
This vid is so funny when Anderson falls on the floor after saying "Not to be Dramatic but I wanna die"- then he continues laying there as the camera pans out.
No
Any universe, any time period. This is a Banger
I love their song and Video ,Smoking out the window😍😂
Anderson has such a deliciously brilliant big beaming smile.
Love this song We definitely need more music like this in this generation !!
with due respect to creative process, I find this an appalling, objectifying, attempt at a hit-song-at-all-cost. If this is the state of your current relationship then you have much personal work to do my friend and in the meantime stop waving that shit out da window and do something helpful.... ESPECIALLY NOW.  You have almost 24 million views on this..... reinforcing negative stereo types.... think of the good you could do.....Your fine musicality is a GIFT, use it with intention and see what happens. #popwithahigherpurpose #doit #morethanmoney
Beautiful song boys ♥️
Look, I'm obsessed 😂😂
I hope I dont have to listen this song for serious and even so  I will be glad
Falling in love with them again ❤️
Makes me pop out my marley 🌿 💎🔸️ Bruno is on another level 🎚🎶🎵
Temtations back  baby...lol 2021..factz
Gotta give u back to the city baby girl 😂
Bruno’s “this bitch” sounded personal god daymn
Perfection ❤️
Bruno Mars is a genius 👏 Love bro 🎶 music ...
Adore youuuuu 🥺😍😭😭😭😭😭😭
this is such a vibe I love it
Anderson Paak out here looking like a Young Red Foxx singing especially that talking part!!! lol Classic.........This right here is grown music!
Way to bring it back!!! The feel, the sound, the style!! Comedy with melody 😂 LOVE YOU GUYS 🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
Un retour dans le temps musicalement 👍 tenue vestimentaire également et qu'elle mélodie 👏👏👏
Un retour dans le temps musicalement 👍 tenue vestimentaire également et qu'elle mélodie 👏👏👏
1:33 me after a minor inconvenience
It's on repeat..🔥🔥🔥
ICONIC
Who else practiced the choreography?  🙋🏾‍♀️
I wanna download this and and split into several cropped clips and use as memes on TWITTER lol
It's just not good
Well this is absolutely amazing
Silk sonic came through for Will 🥶🔥💔❤️
Feels forced
This is hilarious. The song is everything. They singing their butts off while talking shit. I love it. This Damn Bruno is a mess, can't be mad at his culture vulturing because he actually has talent
I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone smoother than Silk Sonic. Literally smoother than silk itself, they’re living up to their name and more!! 😻
Wtheck lol 😂😂😂😂😂
Top
Thanks for bringing back that old funky 70s vibe shizz.
Love the music 🎶 history
GOD DAMN !!! SO F*CKIN HOT ONE !!!
I swear I only saw the lyrics & thought 'WTF' is this. Clicked on cause Paak is music guru. What a SPACE JAM
Bruno went from "ama leave the door open" to " I'll leave that shit closed and throw away the keys"🤣🤣
This needs to be the top song of 2021
this album is going to be timeless and an instant classic 🎰
This is fire! I usually don't rock Bruno but this is nice.
Absolutly musicaly amazing
The words to this song are stupid. Makes me realize how hopeless some men are. A woman NEVER belongs to you and you can't buy loyalty. If he would've had that in his mind from the beginning, he wouldn't have ended up disappointed.
Eu tô passando mal de rir desse clip ... muito bom kkkk
Legendary 💯💯💯💯💯💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just what I needed 😊
God i love them
OMG ..FANTABULOUSLYYYYY...CAPTIVATING.....MASTERPIECE....
Legend's with this masterpiece 👍👍🤟
Its amazing, i love to see this!
I can't stop watching this video and listening to. It's so f.cking funny the way Anderson Paak lays down pretending be dead 🤣
I'm an ol Skooler, and I tell you now, Bruno Mars has been tappin into that ol Skool flavor and giving young bucks something they never heard before.
Now i gotta give you back to the city. This song is dope
Hmm💘
The smoothest betrayal song ever 😂 👌🏼 also I cannot handle A.P. The fade outs had me creasin 🤣🤣🤣
https://youtu.be/8eRfbjWZYl0
I like the song. I just don’t like advertising smoking!,  Young kids who watch this video, will start smoking cigarettes.  🚬 😒😡😫
this song is too damn much...AND I LOVE IT.  and the way they're doing a modern version of The Gigolo dance with their cigarettes!  Anderson.Paak DEAD! ON! THE! FLOOR!  Bruno Mars hitting those notes!  I JUST CANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN'T!!!!!
Bruno went from catching a grenade for you to throwing one at you😂
The dramatic smoking and laying dead on the floor 😌 chefs kiss 😘
It's now #15 on Trending in Malaysia  Also it's now #10 on Trending for Music in Malaysia  Edited It's now #7 on Trending for Music in Malaysia
The old tunes never had cussing, but it's not a bad tune, just a shame about the lyrics.
Silk Sonic .. electric dynamite & pure delicious. Can not stop smiling with delight each time their tunes play. Loving it. ✌🏻💜🎵🎶💜🎵🎶
Give silk sonic every award.. ever.. please!
Bee gees must be proud of raising you, Bruno
A new red pill classic 💊
A boa música, mesmo  por poucos, ainda existe.
This choreo will be in Kim Taehyung's radar soon
Eu amoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Does anyone know where Phil Lawrence has been this whole time?
I was crying when I first seen this video 😂😂😂😂 y’all hear w😂😂😂
If y'all like this style of funk check out witchoo by Durand Jones and the indications
Bruno Mars and his slow drop to his knees is priceless…. 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😳
there is no losing with this group.. they hit the nail every time
"...this bitch..." Adictiva es poco!!! 🔥🔥
Just the line "Got them bad@$$ kids running around my whole crib like its Chuck-E-Cheese" this man spits bars 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Brown guys are so hot
Every time I wake up I hear “This Bitch” & it reminds me that I’m going to have a great day.
TE AMO BRUNOOOOO😍😍😍
Bruno went from "I'll catch a grenade for you" to throwing it back
He straight up told her to pick the Versace up and close the door while she’s at it
"She belongs to everybody" Soviet anthem plays.
I enjoyed this a little too much. 😂 😆
0:55 had me shook his voice made me shiver!!!
I will never stop watching this
Commmeee onnn just drop the album already PLEASE !!!
Adorei está música esses meninos são muito talentosos 👏👏👏👏👏🥰🥰
A TODO VOLUMEN ESTA JOYA 🔊😎!!
LMAO LOLOLOL
Welcome to the crack-cocaine of songs.
EPIC!!!!!!!
So, this is the anthem to "she belong to the streets".
Her fans only page should have been his first clue .
Awesome 😎
relax
I bet they are hilarious in real life
Bruno's tired of catching Grenade😂😂
city boys up 1000 points  🤣💯🚀😤
Silk Sonic is the duo i never knew i needed
NAURRR CAUSE WHO HURT HIM
basically she belongs to the streets.
Bruno snapped on they ass 😂💯
Great song as always
Ladies how could you do this to the one man that thought you were amazing just the way you are and swore on his life that he’d catch a grenade for ya🥺
i was dying when Anderson "died" and then popped back up into screen to sing...I'm not sure of the message its sending calling women "this bitch" and glamorizing smoking though..smh goes to show you Anderson and Bruno could sing about anything and it will sound amazing..definitely going on da playlist...while i vape...haha!🤣
Anderson:*plays dead*  Bruno:  *casual walks over corpse* I saw nothing 👁👄👁
Who's still listening to this song on 3021?
This is a masterpiece legendary
Mac Miller would've loved being on the Remix of this...
Bruno can sing this without a band group and pay some guys to do backgrounds. You can ser how kind and humble he is by picking up unknown guys 😂
Ooooooowwwyy..they uncle fresh .🔥🔥
brono caught the grenade and threw it at her
omh is amazingggggggggggggggggggggggggg
geil
Makes me think of my ex wife. Especially the "Barefoot in these streets line"
It’s the dramatic laying in the floor for me 😂😂
“I was wrong, shut that damn door”
He went from I'll catch a grenade for u to bitch I'll throw a grenade at you 😭😭😭😭😭
So talented so smooth 👏🏽
🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who ready for that album tonight?
Bruno went from “ima leave the door open” to “im finna change the lock”
I swear I come back to this song everyday and it just keeps getting better Lmaoo
Bruno Mars has NEVER missed a beat. He only releases pure magic and fire! Yes!
silk sonic is gloriously filling in the humor r&b vacuum that andy samberg and justin timberlake left lol
The song sounds good, but I don't understand why women are still getting called a "bitch".
DIS BITCH GOT ME PAYIN HER RENT
Good Music.
Bruno Mars😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can imagine how fun their set while shooting this MV. #Legendary
This song just so chill ,type to relax with ur bae with
Sean Kingston in 2010: she's indecisive, she can't decide Bruno Mars in 2021: can't believe it, I'm in disbelief
this duo is the most underrated
🛼
Fome , más de lo mismo
Liked b4 listening and watching lol.    Yup, I love it!!! ❤
Love the vibes🥴💕💖
why do people call this funny?
Yey you go Brunnieee <3
My cigarette would die from that many movements how can theirs still lit on
We've all been here
Bro I just listened to this cuz my wife said she didn’t like it, and I’m just here like I like it A LOT lmao
Yes she belongs to everybody! Don't think only men betrayed you yail girls!😅🤣
This is real music!! You can’t actually hear what they saying
Comedy and a banger I love it 🔥
This sht is a masterpiece🔥
Amazing Guys
Bruno isn’t catching Granada’s anymore! Watch out y’all
This shit hard
0:32 😂😂
Why is the guy on the floor? 😭
Bruno missed the chance to say she belongs to the streets.
Habang nakikinig ako dito nagkakape ako. So smooth😊😊😊😎
My aspiration is now to be this woman they’re singing about
Hermosa canciooooooon aaaaa ;-; :)
It was "This BITCH got me paying her rent "  for me
Bro Bruno threw the grenade back lol
This was what we Needed😂
Just too addictive!🥰🥰🥰
LOL
Mans used a capital *B* for that 😂
bruno really threw the grenade back bruh
*9500 Biatches disliked this song/video*
What's old is new, to those new themselves. This is R&B from the early 70s, in the same groove as the Delfonics, the Manhattans, the Originals, the Intruders, etc. I like Bruno, the man can Sang! But I'm old in the head and if y'all wanna hear the Real thang, check out some of the boys I just mentioned.  Go to the source.
It's the subtle nutty professor reference for me. 🤣🤣🤣  #HerculesHercules
I’m in my 50s and I love love love that 70’s vibe💕💕💕
<3
this music video is a comedy
Smoking kills but Bruno lives ❤️❤️❤️ on and on and on and on ...................
Bruno is untouched in the sense of great music and immaculate vibes
Bruno really threw the grenade back
I like that the cigarettes in their hands are part of the choreo
Great video man! I LOVE the throwback to old Motown reminiscent of the Temptations. Love It. Nice work boys.
You thought this was good?  Just wait for the live performance.
Another hit
Love you so much!
lollllllllllllllllllllllll liked it
"THIS bitch" 🤣🤣🤣
This is fucking beautiful
Smoking 🚬 good..
my man caught one too many grenades
God! This is hot🕺🏾🎶🙌🏾💥💣
Which one of y’all bitches done fucked Bruno Mars up
Never heard someone hit the letter B so hard
If this song only had a sweet, soulful guitar solo. Oh wait, it does... https://youtube.com/shorts/kVuBlMHhym4?feature=share
this song just came up as an ad for another video... i never made it to the other video. BANGER. i just listened 3x in a row
Bruno mars finally remembered his wifi password
เป็นอีกเพลงที่ชอบ คนไทยใครฟังทางนี้คับ🤚🏻🇹🇭
Hmm
This is the build up to an amazing musical in the future, I bet ya
😂😂❤️
Enough with catching Grenade coz THIS BITCH!
Such beautiful melodies, but the lyrics...can we portray women better next time?
This video reminds me of all my uncles
Anderson Paak kills me just poppin into frame at the right time! Probably my favorite video this far from them.
Muito show👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Im so in love 🥲😍
this man aint catching grenades for her, he throwing them at her😭😭
It's more like, Hey Bruno can you beat this song with your next?
Is he hoping that her trifling ass walking bare feet in these street , took me out 😄🤣🤣
Wow!! That is Greatly Classy!!
THIS B*TCH
This is the hardest song out
This b#$*% Run that back thats my jam 🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
I guess he ain’t catching those grenades any more.....
sweetness
Help him please
Ninoy aquino reference 1:44
The 9.5k dislikes are from the girls that caused Bruno to smoke out the window
jacksons five vibe
Bruno ain’t no simp no more 😂😂😂 .
BRO ANDERSON LAYING ON THE FLOOR PRETENDING TO BE DEAD AND RESSURECTING AFTER GOT ME DEAD
That's a nice way of saying "You're a Hoe"
This is so extra 😂
Whats up TTE Fam-Lay I'm going on record saying this song is on a 1-10 scale ⚖  I'm gone give it a 7.5 not really my type of music but it's not bad song it was creative and I think it was funny watching a old school vibe 2 it but yeah Tapp in with the channel for more official reactions 🤟🏾💯
YESS
This song is funny yet at the very same time great!!<3😂😂😂🤘🏽
smoooottthhhhh~
Cool
They are having too much fun living in the 70s
🔥🔥🔥🔥
dramatic
Doing a lot of Jackson 5 moves boys
A modern classic
Another masterpiece <33
Good Song !!! Funny and these two a big team 😂👌🏾
You guys are fuxxin legend👍
Damn, they really say she belongs to the streets
Aritsti e disco del 2021
Im glad real music still exists🤓
Promoting smoking.. 👎🏽
Amo este estilo retro, en ambientación y en arreglo musical... ufff amor mio Bruno Mars eres arte purooo
My dad usually don’t like current music, but he looooves Silk Sonic
Was it Natalie? 🤣
This is what happens when you can do no wrong. You keep getting it right 😂😂😂👌🏼

Cheese (Woah, woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  Pre-Chorus: 0:32 This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Chorus:  0:46 Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Verse 2:  1:16 Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me, please (Help me, please, help me, please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? (1:35)Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  Pre-Chorus:  1:37 This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Chorus:  1:51 Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could you do this to me?)

Бруно- красавчег! Как всегда...
YES Bruno!! :D

Y’all got me Smokin Out The Window 😂
Dude on the left is the in it watch him dance … he out did everybody dancing 🥰
You are my Idol © always support you, God blessed
The drums are insane
in a world that anything can become music, we need this to purifier our ears
LOL! Someone had me smoking out the door once!
This is funniest thing Ive seen in a long time 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wait a minute?? They're singing and playing instruments at the same time??
You can't Leave the Door Open for just anybody. The ones for the streets will have you Smoking Out The Window !
banyo queen susyal version
COOL
On the first time I listened to this it got me chuckling but then I think of it out of nowhere in the middle of the night.
I love it❤️❤️❤️❤️
Classic 😁🙏
I'm loving the whole vibe of this song
greatest song about: she's for the streets
This is what i called Music Videos! Just amazing! This is what a music should be..
I'd like to know the bitch who broke them hahaha lol...
Love this!!
slebhy
OMG! The style, the lyrics, the harmony, the dancing...Everything is just beautiful!
FORGET THAT B##TH.. I'M TRYING TO SEE WHAT THAT BE LIKE.....LOL
its 'to everybody' for me
The Bootsy Collins force and influence is strong with this one.  From the intro to the Bootsy stars in the back of the stage.   I was surprised Bootsy wasn't on bass, but I do expect that to happen on one of these videos at least as a cameo.
dude went from catching grenades for a girl to smoking out the window
Bu şarkıcı çok güzel
Bro this shit is funny as fuck 🤣🤣 Why Anderson had to pop back up like that ? And then Bruno ass just dramatic. I  still love them though♥️
Bruno mars left the door open for Cardi B know she got him smoking out the window
this is unbelievable bruno is def a god he cant be human
🤩🍂🎤
I memorised  the choreography because I've watched this so much
Y'all must be talkin about Natalie from unorthodox jukebox.
Get bitch out. Messes up song! Woman is fine! 🤪🤪😜
She belong to duh STREETS
no one can beat this sheeetttt!!!?!?!?
I do not like the song.
I aspire to be the woman they are singing about...
Y’all 3 for 3 so far. Keep the music coming
I love bruno Mars
😭💗
That moment when AP died and then came back to life 🤣👍
it's giving very much 1970s vibes and i am absolutely here for it
This is so awesome. Love it MBIII
Another nice vibe song with your powerful duo.
Bruno bringing back the old town roads back to the city
Seems like an SNL sketch
Le king Bruno Mars est de retour ! just amazing !
Hello. 👋🏼 Jesus is coming back soon, 🕊I wanted to tell you to find God, 🙏🏼 before it’s too late.💗💗💗
⬅️⬅️⬅️
Definitely new edition music...luv it
This the new national bros anthem! 👌🏾💪🏾😂
THE WHOLE ALBUM IS PHENOMENAL
We should be thankful to have artists like Bruno Mars and The Weeknd to bring us those quality sounds, to wash off our ears from all that bullshit on those "trendings"..
0:32 im done they ALL 🚬 🤣🤣
Can't wait for the album tomorrow!!!
Bruno went from “ I think I wanna marry you “ to “ I wanna get divorced… expeditiously “
Fellas, Thanks for supplying endless fabulousness whilst I milk my cows 🐮 and work my way through all these tomatoes 🍅.  This is by far the FUNNIEST 😂  and classiest yet.   Feel free to stop through anytime, and I’ll feed the entire gang!  We have an outdoor pavilion and a pizza oven, and you can jam to your heart’s content Missouri style.  I wish you ALL love and continued success.
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
I ❤️‍🔥 U
Gotta hand it to him hes not bad
I am crying laughing at this video 😂😂😂😂
lol to all those who thought bruno was all "when i was your man" and "leave the door open" skip to 1:37 . He shut the door LMAO
you had me at DIS BITCH...
Bro said Bitch with a capital B
The dude on the Floor probably an Aquino reference
That foot stomp 😂😂😂 I love that part and the song yess BRUNO keep it up ‼️
Bruno mars is fed tf up 😂😂😂😂
I guess he just threw that grenade back
I saw this as a MF add & searched it INSTANTLY!! this funny asf!🤣😂😭😭👏🏾🙌🏾 I've loved Bruno from the beginning but never thought about YT🤦🏾‍♀️😐
Bruno Mars looking like The Weeknd out here
Love it
I miss the old Bruno Mars
Bruno ain't simping no more
OoOoO SHE BELONG TO EVERYBODY
bruno mars is perfect
I LOVE THEM!😍😍😍
Love the video itself the song is even better 😂
lets retro back with groove
lmao LOVE it!!
Bruno mars isn't singer , he is a genre
Yeah! I was wrong.. 💔😂
My favorite part is when you see him on the floor crying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
❤️👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️💞💞💞
Not to be dramatic but i wanna die🤪🤪👌
Even this is a sad song, still make me dance and smile,  make me happy
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
anyone noticed how much the drummer looks like bruno mars XD
That's hilarious 🤣
Someone has to break to him that he is a sugar daddy
He gets back uppppp okay this a bop🔥🔥🔥
STRAAAAAAIGHT AFTER SINGAAANG !!!! IMAAA LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN <3 AHAHAHAH LOVE THIS JAYUMMMM. TOO FUNNY. NOW IM GOING TO CLOSE MY DOORS LOL
This is what happens when two brilliant musical talents combine and join forces. They are bringing back an older genre with a modern twist and flare. Only Bruno could be a part of something this big.  He is the biggest thing in music since MJ.
OH MY GOODNESS, this is smoking hot
This dude went from I’ll catch a grande to this
U don’t have a Pulse if u don’t like this
No who do him like that, tell me who do u like that ..
Perfection
I lost my shit seeing Anderson Paak on the floor
Those smokin' harmonies!!⭐️
23M views in 6 days just shows you that people wanna laugh😂 instead of watching booty shaking
I always love Bruno mars forever ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Man really said “BITCH” with his whole chest 💀 Lmfao the head tilt and everything
men are no dram creatures, and then this two fine men change the game
Nah cant be smoother than this💯
They are EPIC together, Bruno I love you, Anderson is talented and  hella funny, move over everyone they are here to ROCK THE INDUSTRY!
Bruno went from talking to the moon to going to bed 😂.
This whole album is just a vibe 😋😋have you feeling all good inside
These are the muses from Hercules 😂
I love them!
Bruno Mars went from a gentleman who would do anything for his lover, to a guy who was tired of getting used  Edit: I ain't saying all women are like this but...— it's mostly men who get cheated like this by women
너무 좋다.  미쳤다!!!
s0 sm00th😂❤
Ong bruno never misses
*smoking is injurious to health*
Bruno and paak can't make a bad song if they tried
"Smokin Out The Window"  Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

*Is this song or y'all just made it to make people crack hard huh!!* 😂😂😆
*Is this song or y'all just made it to make people crack hard huh!!* 😂😂😆
great song!
Old skool vibes still exist!
This is a fucking masterpiece😂
She belongs to the street meme has a videoclip now.
CANCIÓN DEDICADA A LAS MUJERES QUE TRAICI0NAN ☝️
🤣🤣🤣🤣 awesome
That...what's that smoke ?
Bruno is the King of falsetto
This shit is classic funny and true as all hell.
this is so dramatic and i love it 👏👏👏
Yeah nah this a 10/10
he threw the grenade back
This is the Step Daddy Post-Love Anthem!
Salute
Real music !! 🧡💙🤍
This song is all about Simp army complaining
Silk sonic = Phenomenal
well shit!!
I love the 70's vibes this song brings
I have million things to say, but I don't know if I am suppose to be learning the groove or falling on the floor in sheer laughter!!!! Man O man, ya'll are KILLING IT ON EVERY ANGLE!!! EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCTION IS EVERYTHING A CHILD OF THE 70'S GREW UP ON!( and misses) The plot, the plan, the sound and please give your production crew a major holla!!! These camera angles, the feed-outs are amazing! Simply THANK YOU '74
Bruno Mars is bringing back that sweet R&B sound that has been absent since the 90’s. Maybe we can have a resurgence of R&B, soul, and rock music on the airwaves. Today’s music is the worst in history
<\3
Anderson come through,  you hope she walking around barefoot...I love it lmbo
Parece el show de las estrellas en Colombia jaja Está muy bueno, la canción y el video. it's amazing
It's kinda a time traveling in the future about past in present
Que groove papai 👌👌👌 arrepia até o último fio de cabelo 🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥
Lmao the unfinished business he has with NATALIE !!!
PERFEITO
Bruno finally realizing he doesn't need to leave the door open
This bitch got me paying her RENT!
Bruno, marry me.
The song in a nutshell: she belongs to the streets   In all seriousness this is my favourite song from them
Since Thursday I’ve probably contributed 100 views 😂 had my dude catching grenades for her, now he smoking out the window 🥴
Bruno on his Motown shit!!!!!👏🏾👏🏾💯
https://youtu.be/MvkO4k2uQL0
:)
"Just the other night she gripping on me tight screaming  Herculeesssss, Hercules, Hercules"
This is the only song I ever heard Bruno curse in
I can't stop listening.  This is one of his best songs and collaboration
Bruno said bitch with a capital mf B with his head to the side you knew he felt that shit
Calling women bit*hes should be banned in MVs. Seriously… he as a lot of fans who are women and I love some of his songs but this word made me appalled after listening to it. Women have it tough enough. In some countries men treat us with so much disrespect and our basic rights are taken away from us. Sigh…😢
Make Malibu 2.0. Honestly, this is garbage in comparison.....
This song> all the rest of modern comedy combined
This is the best "she belongs to the streets" anthem ever 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i know they had so much fun making this video😂😂
how tf do you make a music video funny ?? anderson is dead on the floor and im laughing oml
😂😂😂
*69*
The fact they were holding cigarettes killed me when I first realized it and I couldn't recover 😩 And they stayed holding them the entire video 🤣🤣
This is a EFFING MAGNIFICENT old school type of music. LEGENDS 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
This is just great!
More songs like this ,not those type of songs like travis scott
I’m sorry when he died and then hopped back up 😅😂😂😂😂🤣

Only the good die young.. Billy Joel   Langley, Virginia.  A Temple, a trap. Oh Langley, or leaders. Just give it a wrap
Tempis Fugit  You can grow weeds or you can grow flowers  You can spend minutes or you can spend hours  But time always flies and can never be owned Life is not yours but instead from God, loaned.
Daughter of Women,  Though you were corrupted by the King of the North and whatever the god of forces, this new god, of which our forefathers new not. This unknown that is not of our learning, understanding or order.  Return yourself to the things of heaven that are not a hell. Make way the ready for the coming of The Lord, make ready the way for the coming of The Most High God of Israel, The Lord of Hosts and The King of Jacob. Your ministry awaits and the place with God that is yours and yours alone. That the Holy One of Israel, The Son of Man and Our Father, wait for you, is no understatement. And so does the Kingdom of Heaven.  Inshallah, Deo Volente Amen.
Langley, Virginia.  A Temple, a trap. Oh Langley, or leaders. Just give it a wrap
Paak & Mars = Real R&B classic vibes
Bruno mars adalah penyanyi kesukaan almarhum temen saya☹️
The song is not only amazing.. it’s true!! I relate 😂 100%
This man ain't catching grenade anymore 🥲
This so extra love it
This is the most perfect music video I’ve seen in a long time   Best teeth in the game.
To quote the great Snoop Dogg, “This muthafucka don’t miss. That muthafucka don’t miss man. In the heat of battle he don’t miss. In the heat of controversy he don’t miss.”
you are the 21th century new Micheal Jackson dude
x 1.25 fucking good
Cats here paying some SERIOUS homage to Motown! Bringing back true R&B/Pop. #facts
You guys are killing the game….this shit here is EVERYTHING ❤️😶‍🌫️I done played this video like 8 times already

Classy way to say "she belongs to the streets" 🇵🇭🤣
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
I really enjoy this duo.  They really don't get the recognition they need. The music, the dance routines, and the comical twist they add to it. They're priceless!
They haven’t missed yet 🔥 🔥 🔥
Who is here after "BB ki Vines "Dindora""?❤️😅

1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  1 John 5:13  These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have ETERNAL LIFE, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
This guys are Legends🤣🤣🤣
Disappointing... tobacco isn't cool anymore.
英語わかんないけどなんか好き
This WHOLE ALBUM is a beautiful, yet comical, shout out to the good, soul music from back in the day. We love it. 🎶

Brown velvet suits need to make a comeback. Or is that just me? 😄
Beautiful song
转账100万
ᴀɴy ɪɴᴅɪᴀɴ ʜᴇʀᴇ???
this is so cool and funny
The most iconic comedy moment in music is anderson entering his verse with “this b*tch* 😂
how to say she belongs to the streets in a classic way lmao. THESE GUYS STAY GOATED.
Bruno looks kinda like Michael Jackson but without the surgery.
At this point this song is more addictive than the nicotine in they're smoking out the window. DAMN
🌟 ⭐ 💛
I hate to say it but smoking hasn't looked this cool since Mad Men
Hmmmm. Love the old school vibe, but let’s squash the b-word, please.
🤣😂😅😆No words to describe. LOL!!
This is SPICY NICE
Just the other night you was gripping  on me tight screaming Hercules Hercules Hercules.. 🔥
this year’s a good year for RNB 🥰
Super song... Thanks for the lyrics... Kisses from Paris 🗼
🌹
But I was wrong, she belonged to the streets
Bruno either getting old or the cocaine is catching up
Now this is music🔥🔥
Who’s stressing y’all out😭
Anderson Paak springing back up like a damn crack addict, gets me everytime🤣🤣
"OHHH NOOO" 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
Always amazes me how much effort bruno mars puts into choreography.
Bruno doing the things where he points at nothing behind him is 'THIS BITCH' in body language.
Shake your shoulders babe ~
Can somebody please feel the exactly same for me✋
They went from "skate to me baby" to "THIS B!@$#"
ninoy dedz
I'm gay
The album was released  Me: 2:44 🤭🤣
She 4 Da Streetz 💯
One more day until the release of an masterpiece
kinda like when andre the giant was in an episode of A team...or was he huh? you dont know, i dont know, these kids barley recognize brunos elderly gaze...leisure suits stress me out.. so, how do you deal with antisocial compensators by the way?  not that thats these guys, nt even realy has beens yet an theyre all solid but you know those people the get the latest whatever it is and use it to fuel hide thier imferiority complex by holding it out like a battering ram, get really pissed when you dont notice and ask them what the fronts about?  if you dont want me aking, dont wear your special ed badge out on your sleeve, trying to help your labyrinthian ass see over the hedges stupid. nice watch though...
I cant wait for this album 😒
I bet they had so much fun making this video its so funny!
Bruno went from "I'll catch a grenade for you" to "This Bish"😂😂😂😂
The remix has to be with the The tempations
I've already listened to this song 1313 times. Can songs create addiction, because I'm hooked
Reminds me of Gladys Knight & the Pips doing Midnight Train to Georgia

Trending in Malaysia.. congrats to all of you..
Damn that "This Bitch"with capital B 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥
Bruno went from "Imma' leave the door open" to "Get out of the door"😂
Well…… there is always a song that comes out and tells you exactly what was going on when it was made. Congrats fellas this one is a classic.
Went from leaving the door open to dam straight dead bolting it🤣
This video reminds me of The Rain by Oran Juice Jones. Especially that part when Anderson just talks.
mad love for Bruno mars... i'd pay a 100 stacks to see your show
Who said Bruno Mars era has end!?, it's only the beginning bit**
who  hurt u ? who do i gotta beat up?
my boi from wanting to catch a grenade to this
Silk Sonic wanted the door to be left open, went inside, now, they smoking out the window. Oh God. They needa skate out of that girl life.
😍❤️❤️❤️
The best in the song - music and voice! Not dramatic falling on floor, although it was great and talented. Wonderful music and song, that you can sing like a melody  with words! People forget that a song - is a melody with words but not rap. Thanks to Silk Sonic
👏👏👏👏👏💖💖💖💖💖😍😍😍😍😍
Omg I love this!
1:33 this you looking for?
Now I have to go back smoking. I thought its out of fashion. Such a stupid commercial. Idiots

From "catching a granade for you" to. 1:37
💛Anderson
the outfits reminded me of "Treasure"
Unbelievable. He could be singing about balancing his checkbook and it would still sound good. What a talent what a gift. Thank you Bruno.

Nearly fell outta my chair when I saw Anderson Paak lying on the floor. Melodic Hilarity,,,,Luvin' It!
cultural appropriation - canceled
Warning Cigarettes where harmed and wasted in the making of this video🤣🤣🤣🤣
Murder she wrote, pimper's paradise...
i loveeeeeeee this but please don't smoke, smoking literally kills 🤡
JEREMIAH 31:3 The Lord appeared to us in the past, saying: “I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness.   💕 The Lord love us so much his love for us is unending and everlasting, if you think no one cares for you and love you, always remember that God loves you, even before you were born and until now he still loves you. He gave his one and only Son Jesus to die at the cross for our sins, just to save us from hell and to be with him forever in heaven. So  do not waste the love of the Lord. He said in JOHN 3:16 "FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVE IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE". He said that if you believe in his son then you will receive everlasting life you will be with him forever in heaven. So follow and believe JESUS so that you will be with God forever in heaven, where there is no suffering. joy and peace will be with you forever.   ❤️GOD BLESS YOU. PRAY ALWAYS AND READ THE BIBLE.
Shall we put the old heads on now 🤣
🤣

I took your momma to Yard House
I keep smiling throughout the whole video. Such a beautiful video to watch.
Damn! Bruno Neve fail to amaze me with his music
Every dude’s theme song in life whether they realize it or not.
This somehow feels like the Jackson Five, soul music, and 1974 in one video.
Perfect

And he does it again.
I missed you, Bruno

I wanna find the remix when they say she belongs to the Streets :D
On dirait mj

Others ARTISTS Music Vedio: All Twerking half NAKED Women  Bruno Mars:Smooth Classic 90s Style Music Vedio
This literally sent me to another world!❤️🌍

If you don't like this I can't lie I can't trust your taste in music 🤷🏿‍♂️. This is smoother than silk (the pun intended).Makes me wish I could have experienced the 70s 1st hand.
This shit is getting played out, completely unoriginal
When do the concert tickets go on sale?
Comedic gold
Lol I love this
It doesn’t get any better than this fellas next level stuff 🔥
He used to catch grenades  Now he can’t even catch feelings anymore
Everything in this song is perfection: Bruno, Anderson, the back up singers, the musicians, the outfits, the vibe, the lyrics and melody, the harmonies, the comedic genius, the choreography..... At least 1 million of those views are mine.
The musical mood we need !!!
Back in time babeeee
he won't be leaving the door open anymore 💀💀
thank you for smoking
Coke RnB is back 🔥🔥
한국방송에서는 모자이크 떡칠해서 나오겠네~
It took me 1 second to know I love this song.
This a classic sht to say that "this hoes ain't loyal"
God bless you for this masterpiece 😍😍😂
The creativity in this song..... It's amazing.
This song is a certified world classic
awesome 🔥🔥🔥
Certified Classic.
These gentlemen are gonna get alot of Grammies 🙌🏾
One ciggie last for the whole song while throwback of what happened in life. Aye mate! Just “Smokin Out The Window” after that girl “Skate” in when you “Leave The Door Open” 😂
If this is performed live, I can tell the audience gonna laugh everytime Paak falls on the floor
日本の人いないかな
His pose while lying down is just comedy peak in this genre
Smokin on the window play my Nintendo
vibin!!
making me think they we’re gonna repeat “Disbelief” . But instead holding the beat and saying "Dis Bitch". Smooth n’ Smart
Pure sonic genius!💖💖💖
I can imagine Will walking around the house playing this looking at Jada
Lawd! That man is hurt and stressed! Chain smoking bout his credit card bill and she has all the assets. She made a fool out of him. He even talked mess about the kids...that he's probably babysitting while she's out with another man! 😂
Is it safe to assume that you joined silk sonic? Coz your blend is so good
This album on vinyl PLEASE!!!
👏🏼👏🏼
He went from “just the way you are” to “where’s the way out”
Bruno said bitch with capital B🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I only thinking what will happen when they will perform live in front of other celeb...specially female !
😂 smooth but a story as old as time.
S/O to Eric Hernandez for making sure the music video drum pattern matched the actual record 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
PERFEITOOOO!!!!
Grown folk music 💯🔥🔥🔥
The way he pops up off the ground and starts singing 💀
Has Bruno Mars grown? He looks like he's at least 4'11" now.
Oh! Those moves!!   I can’t stop watching!
The other song where doodoo
NICE I LOVE IT 👍🏼
i wondered how many cigarretes they lit😬😬😬 but the mv is fantastic it's like they brought me to the 70 & 80's❤️❤️❤️
Now this is what is called smooth jamz 😎
This is a very classy way to say, "She belongs to the streets"
I’m in stitches 😂😂😂 now they know how we women feel when we invest . Trifilling ass tho , ouch 🤕
THIS IS INCREDIBLY BOTH HILARIOUS AND A MASTERPIECE INDEED
I ABSOLUTELY JUST ADORE THIS SONG!! These 2 are great!! I love the stuff their doing!! This video cracks me up!! It’s SOO funny! I just love it!! ❤️❤️
Let's be honest. We watched the ad on tiktok  more than once
Love the Nutty Professor reference

A step up from F*ck You (Cee-Lo) 🤣🤣
One thing I really like about this song is that it has such a good storyline, and the fact that Anderson's way playing dead was top notch
Any slight inconvenience  “Not to be dramatic but I wanna die”😂😂😂
They try so hard to make him look not short
The music don’t lie https://youtu.be/gVfEt1PXbjQ
Oh, goodness...
when anderson popped back at 1:52 had me dyin
🔥
My girl said he done threw the grenade back
“ she belong to everybody “ silk sonic 2021
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die" *proceeds to play dead* I LOVE HIM SO MUCH HAHA
This is so screaming whispers Olivia type but upgraded ,if you look at that video the whispers had the same similar suite , I just died when I seen this video and it took me back to that
Their song and choreography both are just awsome 🔥
Damn - why is this song so good? I can't stop smiling!
Could I just say the effects and emphasis during the Hercules part of the song is just brilliant
I like the vibe❣️
So don't simp 😂
No more catching grenades, he is throwing them at her-
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌💯💯💯💯💯✅✅✅✅✅
You just can’t shit on these guys. Especially Bruno and Andi. I don’t think I’ve ever hated anything this talented man has put out.  So smooth yo. 😎
That's very amazing
He went from "Ill catch a grenade for ya" to "Ill throw a grenade AT ya" LOL.
This is so fuggin dope
Lol they left the door open and now they have to be smoking at the window
Yo I cried when paat fell then came back up on his part aww man that was funny but Bruno killed his part he really went in for it to be comedy/r&b/soul
Beautiful

Certf banger
Never have I repeated a song's intro so many times before even listening to the whole piece !!!!
Oh my, oh my.... I can't wait u go on Tour. This is crazy, hard work u guys put it. It's Vibing, it's bussing.  I loved it... 💖
absolutely amazing
Bruno had only 3 lines to perform :)))
This feels a lot more authentic than the other two releases, idk why but nice 👌
Best song this year hands down
Don't smoke its dangerous 😬
Beautiful song love from India
Damn he throwin the grenade back
This hun legit got me smokin out the window.
Why he look like El DeBarge
future anthem
OFFICIAL “she belong to the streets” anthem 😂
Take me back into time... ⌚🔙❤️😍
Alguien que hable español? Jejejeje
Silk Sonic welcome to hoodville fam
ang cute 😸
Oh I just love everything they do!!!
ของโครตดี
Shit just makes u wanna pimp slap someone
Honestly, probably two of the most creative artists of this generation. Collabin' together. They do belong to everybody!
Wowowowowowo super!!!!,
I have this on REPEAT 😂😂
Another certified BOP!! Their talent blows my mind. And that comedy added in,  was the icing on the cake!
Never heard the word Bitch said so smooth might have just eclipse Too Short 😂
at this point he's just carrying the industry
Got her bad ass kid running round my whole crib like it’s chucky cheese 🤣🤣🤣
😼😼🔥🔥🔥
Some OPP shit right here! Where is the OPP gang??
This is major.... old school R&B...  Wow... but we did not use the "B-word" back in the day.  Nice camera work though.
I’m 17 and I’m enjoying that 70s beat to the song.
Dripping 70s soul sound, sweet harmonies and smooth groove. That’s a very nice sound that is missing in the music industry
Damn it sounds so catchy and at the same time wondering damn who broke ur heart
I just don’t understand the cigarettes😕Lotta kids are going to start smoking.
Bruno aint simping no more, Bro really threw the grenade back😭
Another musical masterpiece 💚🙌
One thing Bruno gone do is SING
Amazing!!!
I don’t smoke at at all, but now I want a cigarette..
😍😍😍
A perfect song!
LMAO!!! Hilarious af 😂
Because of this video they’re going to bring back the it’s cool to smoke cigarettes commercial lol
<3
When he dramatically said "i want to die" and keeled of the floor i felt that
SO FUCKING GOOOOODDDDD
It's a pity YouTube will only let me like something once
I just can’t stop watching this, just perfect 🔥
Went from 24k magic to my life is tragic
Bruno wants to be black so bad
i know they dont make the stogees like they used too. they lasted forever
Leave The Door Open Smokin Out The Window  Next Song:  Screaming From The Rooftop  😁🤭😊✌🏼
y lo volvió a hacer Brunito Mars
This is like him regretting what he did on "That's what I like."
Guys I need a slow song from you.. like Versace vibe
This what I've been waiting for. I fallowed this album through Boots, so happy to finally hear that familiar groove. Fully Satisfied
This bitch! Smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ that’s exactly what I said when I got the bad news 🗞
This is art.
It was the fact that Bruno had to lean in to vent about her bad ass kids running around his crib!!!! 🤣😂
People who disliked this masterpiece prolly need a covid test
Manz went from "dripping in finesse " to "im finna finesse the flip outta here"😂😂
Instant classic! I cannot remember the last time I loved an R&B song from the moment I heard it and could hardly sing along for laughing. Might be a first. Bruno and Anderson are foolish!
沒有想到呂士軒也那麼會唱🥺
1:44 this is solid meme material.
Giving me new age Temptations vibe!!
90's vibe
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
0:58
Anderson Paak looks like Bobby Womack ...😂😂😂😂😂
This song...GOT ME FUCKED UP!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Music is okay. Lyrics are awful.
Ohhhhhh....yal really bringing this music back for the aunties and uncles... and meeee lol... I see whatchu doing over there
Soy japhet sin teléfono xd
If there's ever a song that describes relationships when they go sideways right now .... this is it
Bruno and Anderson Paak, best duo and the whole group as a whole IS EVERYTHINGGGG
Noo... Oh my good God!!!! You know sometimes you listen to a song and you are convinced that the artist wasn't anywhere near this dimension while playing/making it. This is it, this is what soul is... And matters of the soul can't be explained...SPECTACULAR!!
The nicest way to say "She belongs to the streets"
6 day and 22MILLION legendary 🙌 ❤ 👌 ✨ 🙏
That was too funny and too good!
I can't stop laughing at 1:50
Is it just me or I find this vids better at 240p ?
Man went from "drippin’ in finesse to getting finessed
I'm soo crushing on this entire band.
I love 70´s vibes on this song
I need them to go ahead and make a whole album
How many tons of smoke they brun out till the end recording this MV?? 😂🤣😂🤣👌
Smooth frfr 💯🔥
ugh I LOVE THEM SO MUCHHHHHHHH
Ajudem esse humilde karinha aq 🙌🏻🙏🏻
@Swoozie need to hear this.
otherwise this s hit song as usual from the dual
This shit Is banging
how can there be only 9.2k haters shame
The amount of times I have actually smoked out of the window due to relationship stress is now hilarious
More of the old school R&B vibe please! Love ❤ this! Keep it up!
This warmed my heart, pray everyone finds someone that makes them happy 😊
Love them... Love this song!!
im in love with this
🤣🤣 I love it!
She don’t belong to the streets, she belongs to the whole city haha.
Dear Mr Mars, I feel sorry for any person/people this song may have been based on.  Way harsh, even if it was meant to be satirical.  Can we just go back to the good vibes please?
Bruno’s voice is caramel and Anderson paak boy boy boy he was already great but Bruno brought that magic out! They are an amazing duo and I’m ready for more! Bring me that album NOW lol
Hercules Hercules
Definition of true player shit 🥂
Genius
I can't stop listening.. This is an amazing song whilst being hilarious.. great visuals.. I can't stop! hahah
I mean at least I was in the stream
TIK TOK HERE I COME…‼️‼️🏃🏾‍♂️‼️‼️
This man had a break up and made money off of it keep your head up king focus on yourself
Whoever got my man Bruno this fucked up need to apologize man's threw bk the grenade atp he ain't simpin nomre lol
te quiero bruno
Can't wait to see them perform this song live!!!
When you said that was “Your Girl” the Y was silent and we had to give her back to the streets my guy !!!🤣🤣🤣
Finally some real music
.Paak is a whole comedian 😂
love this song and video, but bad cord continuity at 2:46 when bruno falls on his knees the cord for the mic goes in between his legs, then the camera cuts and it's outside his legs, then it cuts back and the cord is back in between his legs, then again it cuts to outside his legs and he stands up
Paak + Mars said *"This Bitch"*  ....I felt that 😎👌🏽
🤣🤣 needed this song & video
Yo cada 5 minutos:  THIS BITCH GAVE ME
Never fail to disappoint 🙏
Bro This music is Legendary is Wonderful 🤩👌
esse homem não tem um defeito que música.. 🖤
Come on baby 🐗
I just can’t stop laughing 🤣
Dayum that was a trip
Pretty sure Bruno Mars is obsessed with this style because it makes him look tall, lol.
Old school? NOPE new COOL!!
Bruno Mars makes better and lasting music by himself. Pak is wack.
Be pimpin dont be simpin!
i loveeeeeeeeee ittttttttttttttttttt
If this was a mandatory course in school the world would be a happier place with a sustainable population and crushed velvet would dominate the workplace.  Silk Sonic don't miss... ever.
The game is cold but fair. 🤷🏿‍♀️
Funny thing is people be knowing how these kind of people are and still pick them. Then they want to blame em & call them out their names when they break their heart & use them for their money 😂🤣😂
I love them! ❤
The Anderson 8 hour pass out..then back to the hook "Smoking' Out the window of a Benzo" brings me LIFE!!!!!!!
Freaking brilliant! I watched this thing 6x. Love the 70s FTS vibe.
When he said "I gotta give you back to the city" I felt that
I’m so damn high maboii this shit hit good shit Bruno
y aquí se viene otro exitaso como el de leave the door open 😈😈
00:32   You're welcome.
Amazing thing I've ever heard 🤣🤣
LOVE IT!!!❤❤❤
😆
9k downvotes all from Salty Women.
When Anderson fell out and stayed there then popped back up to sing again I fell tf out😭😭
Refreshing  good music 🎶
If this came out in 1973 it would be 8 minutes long
the ''not to be dramatic'' really hits me
Essa música agora e o hino mundial do planeta terra, trás paz e muita calma! Obrigado Bruno Mars ❤️🇧🇷
If Bruno Mars or The Weekend can 't save black  music, I really don't think no one else will be able to do it.
Super Sonic
This great on so many levels!
I don't smoke!
Bruno threw the grenade back
Bruno went from “when I was your man” to “when I gave a damn”… welcome to the darkside brotha
But I also hope your trifling ass is walking around BAREFEET in these streets, LOOKOUT🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If they don't get a Grammy, I'm literally shocked
Yoo the chorus had me in tears…😂😂😂 THIS BITCH GOT ME!!!
wow.. just amazing...
Brooo hit after hit after hit, damn
BROOO goosebumps Shits too good
Uff,🔥
the only other dynamic duo we need is j. cole & kendrick.   bruno & anderson are saving r&b. cole & kendrick save rap please.
she belong to the street future must be proud
Bruno walks over Andy's dead body for that close-up.
If passive aggressive was a song…  😂😂😂
Always singing Good and soft sonhos!!!
Addicted already ❤❤❤
Oh that's the Jam!!  Yaaas!
Ok bcuz that skate to me was some BULLSHIT but I appreciate this shit right here
Hall & Oates ruled the duo categories for years.  now we got a new generation of the top DUO
if this man doesnt get a grammy, that's just injustice right there
Bruno ain't catching grenade for you no more😂
once again another masterpiece has been created. my ears have been blessed!
It’s Anderson laying on the floor the whole time
This is music 😁
Bruno went from “Catch a grenade for ya” to “Throw a grenade at ya”
Why bruno look like my grandpa when he had hair
Bruno was fed up @1:37. I keep watching it and cracking up 😂😂😂
Why is nobody talking about the Chuck E. Cheese’s part 💀
Loved this song got it in my weekend play list
I am mesmerized - these guys got rhythm and how.....
the way they danced, it was so on rhythm, it was so satisfying
Since ya lady's going to be in ya felling with summer walkers new album us fellas going to be over here with bruno not taking no shit😂😂
Sweet
What makes this song even funnier is I'd imagine this is a continuation of the story from the previous two songs.
He’s so authentic to himself and his style
Anderson paak. Literally killed his vocals
This is grown folks music.
🔥🔥🔥💯💯
This Song is Catchy As F*** !!! I can’t stop listening to it ..... 🎶 "Smoking Out The Window" !!!!  🎶
Wow " Anotner 1 " just 🔥 this dude knocks em out the park just about every time !!
I can't wait for the concert to come to San Antonio Tx.🙃💪💪
i love Mr. Mars
Brown Eyed Soul is my go to music for 90s 80s and 70s 60s for Korean music industry where as Silk Sonic is #1 in the US music industry when it comes to bringing back the old.
People really need to appreciate what Bruno is doing right now
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Vivan los 70's !!!! Gracias Bruno !!!
This song gonna get everybody smoking out the window.  I'll be puffin cigars out the window.
When I saw Anderson laying on the floor ☠️☠️🤣😭
Whoever that is on the drums is FIONE! I can tell from way over here!
Is this ad for lung cancer?
I can't wait to get this album
I was wondering why the lyrics are a complete joke for a Bruno Mars song...
I love it please bring these days back yessss!!!!
Future : She belong to the streets ! Silk Sonic : 🎵🎷 *Sheee Beloooongs to everybodyyyy* 🎷🎵
such brilliance
Why he had to fall out in the floor like that? Dramatic
😂😂👏🏾👏🏾🎉
Oh Bruno you done done it again baby!
This is the song that I've been needing true R&B classics. It's a hit for me
This a jam
meniii gokil pisannnn
this is like If "She belong to tha Streets" was a Song
Anyone else thought they were looking at Homer Simpson when .paak went "Oh no!"?
This song as a twist of dave chapelle 🤣
it's nice to see popular musicians not taking themselves too seriously
Jackson 5 vibes lmao
I will fight you if u don’t like Bruno, the whole silk sonic movement or this song run me my fade straight up
Perfect. Evocative of a classic era and a satirical statement about the world in which we live.
this song is such a MOOD. 🤤
Love it love it the feel of the 70's
When they sing "THIS BITCH" they mean it🥲😂
Dr.dre felt this one
I was taken to higher realms by Bruno’s voice, my eyes closed. Only to open them to find Anderson sprawled out prone on the floor, LOL! Omg music so sweet and funny.
Did Dr. Dre write this song?
this is so smooth, didnt expect anything else
At this point I’m dying for this album to come out
This duo is making history together is incredibly special and comic as hell
Smooth, Leave the Door Open then Smokin Out The Window. We appreciate more music like this.
They truly are smoking
Thank you!!!!!! Blessings always 🙏
This song got me out of my depression! Strange, but true! ❤❤❤❤❤
no but they are just... i just love them
lindo
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love how they filmed the dancing at the microphones. 😊 Very reminiscent of The Temptations.
I can't stop laughing.. This is awesome🤣🤣🤣
The Chuck E. Cheese part thoo it gave me  weird  vibes
Amazing hope they keep this chemistry and just enjoy making music together
This looks like a talent show
omg this is amazing
drops to knees (James Brown)   Brown Velvet suits (Jackson 5)  Choreography (Temptations)  Background (Soul Train)  Cigarette Holding (Sammy Davis Jr)  ."Kids running while like its Chuck E Cheese"  (Bruno Mars)  Drops Dead & Pops up on cue (Anderson.Paak) ITS GRAMMY TIME!  BEST COMEDY...BEST VIDEO...BEST SONG...BEST CHOREOGRAPHY...BEST GROUP...BEST PRODUCER...BEST R&B...BEST POP....BEST IN CATEGORY...BEST IN CLASS..."sending her BACK to the streets..."   lol.....AFTER "leaving the door open"....LOL...
Yall we got to props to the background singers too!!!  Harmony, smooth moves, eye candy, vibing on grown ass men problems!!!
Hey Bruno..what do i gotta do to be this bitch?? (Asking for a friend!)
I must've played this song bout 35 45 fuckin tiiimmmeeesss
🔥🔥
Who did this to him 😭
Greatest first verse ever written. It’s witty, memorable, every punch line landed, not one word was wasted.
he really brings the funk back
Berta Daily Top 10 11-11-2021 Top 9 Yesterday:9 Peak:9 Days:4
1:37 no but whyd he have to sound so aggressive tho 😭😭😭
Man...Bruno ain't talking to the moon no more
I’ve generally never liked Bruno Mars, but this collaboration has *really* been winning me over.
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
best duo
Dude the production on these last couple songs they've done is incredible
"not to be dramatic, but i wanna die" yoo
💛
Bruno just out here effortlessly flexing.
Ingredients Take a few spoons of Marvin Gaye Add a few drops of James brown Whisk it with some delfonics Sprinkle a little of the Jackson 5 Then spread it evenly but generously over some Marvin Gaye,  Turn the heat up to gas mark prince  And your result is a delicious tasting song by sonic silk  This song had me smoking out the window thinking "how this bitch have the audacity to make me cheat"
Imagine fucking up a relationship with Bruno Mars then you hear this song 🤣🤣
OMG NO PUEDO ESPERAR A EL VIERNES
I'm calling it: Grammy Winner for Best Album
B r u n o M a r s ? !
Fun song! But don’t these artists realize the message they’re sending to youngsters is that it’s cool to smoke cigarettes.
"THIS BITCH!!!!!!!"
This is a certified hood classic!
Bruno Mars channels R. Kelly at 2:43 Greatness
As funny as this is it's definitely a vibe
Sheeesh chill 🔥
Coach Greg Adams sent me here..... #FreeAgentLifestyle
This shit hea to funny.. ayeeeee I love it
Why does it feel like they’re bringing bck a classic 😆love it
After one night when she put it on me 0:32
I just love how Anderson dramatically died and came back to life 😂😂
I like this old school vibes I’m getting from this video
Day after tomorrow is gonna be big
Shouldn't have left the door open!
gat daym that drip is so fly. These guys just know how to do it right.
it's 2021 and every song is full of electronic sounds. u listen to this, which is so unexpected, feels damn good a complete masterpiece lookin forward to hearing the album
WAS I THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT THIS MAN DIED??
Clearly none of these dudes has ever smoked or even held a cigarette. Posers, every one of them.
wait it looks like the set of when i was your man, where is the piano
Lmao went from catching grenades tk throwing them😭
bruno really said: “put a bullet straight through your brain”
This reminds me of old school. their dance moods are off the hook.   It's funny too.
You know there are black people that hate Bruno Mars makes this type of music. They ass gonna be hot listening to this. Lol
Bruno Mars got that Sammy Davis JR vibe going on!!!!!
drop the album already......shit!
As always❤
I don't like slow songs but this shit is fire!
I have No Doubt EVERY SINGLE SONG on this Album will be a Hit! 🔥 and #TheGrammyGoesTo #SilkSonic and The #Oscar for BEST Death Drop #AndersonPaxx 😅
Nice to see these guys putting a fresh kick on an old genre!
DOPE 🔥🔥🔥
9k Haters😕
6 days and it's still #1 on trending
Somebody said that Bruno went from "I'mma leave the door open" to "I'm finna change the locks" and I can't stop wheezing 😭
Bruno came in with that capitol B - Bitch
This is the type of music you need to play at your child support court hearing. 🤷🏻‍♂️
You know the meme that says "she belongs to the streets" ??  Yeeh this is that meme, just in music 💯
P.E.R.I.O.Dtttt

Silk sonic's songs have this carefree comical vibe with a touch of melodic perfection.
Anderson Paak : Not to be dramatic but I wanna die *actually dies* Me : 👁👄👁
Dripping in auto tune.

This is a cure for depression. What an amazing song!

GAK BISA BAHASA INGRIS
I don't think Bruno jumping in front of a train anymore😂
Liked before even watching it
Kinda funny seeing women in the comment of a song basically calling them out for being trash to men.........soon enough there will be generations of single women and the amount of them that become homeless,, ah ha ha ha ha i cant wait for the culture shift
Bruno mars era will never dieeeee♥️
#HowPlayazTurnAJammedUpFunkyHeartBreakIntoAGlammedUpGrammyPlay...

Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.

i was already laughing with the first oh no, then paak start his verse off with... THIS. BITCH lol

Complaining.... but make it a ✨vibe✨
Bruno said I'm done catching grenades for ya 😂😂
this confirms to me that Bruno Mars is the reincarnation of James Brown
Oh my lord, this song had me laughing!
she belongs to the streets
A happy city :) is a good city :)
ALL us single dudes can relate to this song..They will need a big box to carry out all the Grammy's they will get from the album. The funky soul 70's vibe is completely on point!!!
something i don't see anyone point out about this duo is how genuinely and consistently funny they are together. every video be splitting my sides
keep it going guys👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
what the fuck 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why aren't more songs like this nowadays?
The whole vibe of Silk Sonic is sheer genius!
Veo videos musicales con mi padre de los años 70's Kool and the Gang, Brother Johnson, etc, y este video  me recuerda a todos ellos. Lo ame y aparte muy graciosa a letra y el vídeo ♥️
Anderson looking like Bobby Womack in the glasses 🤓 did it for me.....along with him dramatically dying.  And the cigarettes on stage...classic.  I am loving this song and the whole Bruno/Anderson vibe. They are making soulful music and having fun doing it.
I Love Bruno
this song got me paying her rent  🥰
Smoking has never been more cool with these guys. The whole emsemble is so chill yet soulful at the same time.
Nahhh when my man died and came back to life😂😂😂
Funny and fantastic 🤣
So funny😂😂😂😂
truly this bxtch got me payin her rent.. smh
Thank you
muito bom
Bruno’s delivery of “this Bitch” is just great 🤣
Character growth is 2011: I will catch a grenade for you  2021: this bitch belong to the streets
Y'all need to make a album
Best era of American music is 60s 70s 80s rnb. They nailed it.
Lmaoooo.....i love this song
an absolute vibe
The only idiots who don't like this song are ... well ... idiots!
Wanna dedicate this to the homie Will Smith.
I'm just speechless at how much I like the song 😳🤣
Yooooo I’m in tears!!!! I love Bruno!  When I say I’m crying real tears!

When he said *this bitch* I immediately loved the song
When you are not supposed to like this as a woman but dam its a BOP!! 😂
He ain't say give her back to the streets, he said give her back to the city...Damn that's cold.
“THIS BITCH” !!! Enough said 😌
Back to the streets 🤣🤣🤣

This Bitch with a capital B!!!!!!
The camera crew understood the assignment and deserves 10 raises! Their direction made the comedy come to life for us. From the first, “This bitch”, to the guy falling on the ground- to getting up…. It was all so smooth and captured nicely 🏆
I love u andy

*Youtube is removing dislikes in order to prevent the viewers from having a voice!* This is the last straw, move to rumble, boycott youtube, spread the word
I can picture this song being dedicated and wrote about a real and or fictional man named Otis who’s a 60 year old sugar daddy to a young lady named Lisa,  who has 4 kids. Lisa’s been cheating on Otis,  Otis told Slik Sonic, so they wrote a song about it and it’s now legendary 😭😭😫🤣
[Intro: Bootsy Collins] Wait A Minute! This Love Started Out So Tender And So Sweet But Now She Got Me Smoking Out The Window  [Verse 1: Bruno Mars, Anderson] Must've Spent Thirty Five Forty Five Thousand Up In Tiffany's (Oh! No) Got Her Badass Kids Running Around My Whole Crib Like It's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah! Woah!) Put Me In A Jam With Her Ex-Man In The UFC Can't Believe It (Can't Believe It) I'm In Disbelief  [Pre-Chorus: Anderson & Bruno Mars] This Bi*ch Got Me Paying Her Rent, Paying For Trips Diamonds On Her Neck, Diamonds On Her Wrist And Here I Am All Alone (All Alone) I'm So Cold, I'm So Cold You Got Me Out Here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson] Smoking Out The Window (Smoking Out The Window) Singin' How Could She Do This To Me? (How Could She Do This To Me?) Oh! I Thought That Girl Belonged To Only Me But I Was Wrong 'Cuz She Belong To Everybody, Everybody  [Verse 2: Anderson] Just The Other Night She Was Gripping On Me Tight Screamin' Hercules (Hercules, Hercules) Got Me In The Club Looking For A New Love Someone Help Me, Please  (Help Me, Please, Help Me, Please) Baby, Why You Doing This?  Why You Doing This To Me, Girl? Not To Be Dramatic, But I Wanna Die  [Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars] This Bi*ch Got Me Paying Her Rent, Paying For Trips Diamonds On Her Neck, Diamonds On Her Wrist And Here I Am All Alone (All Alone) I'm So Cold, I'm So Cold You Got Me Out Here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson] Smoking Out The Window!  (Smoking Out The Window Of The Benzo, The Benzo) Singin' How Could She Do This To Me? (How?) (How Could You Do This To Me?) Oh! I Thought That Girl Belonged To Only Me (One Things Fasho, One Things Fasho) But I Was Wrong (I Was Wrong) 'Cuz She Belong To Everybody, Everybody (She Belong To) Yeah! She Belong To Everybody That Girl There, She Belong To Everybody  [Interlude: Anderson] (Oh!

I Thought That Girl Belonged To Only Me But I Was Wrong (I Was Wrong) 'Cuz She Belong To Everybody, Everybody (She Belong) Yeah! She Belong To Everybody She Belong To Everybody Oh!
Bruno Mars forever
"hope that your trifling a** is walking round barefoot in these streets" had me dying laughing.
And yet one more HIT!!!!
Absolute genius on so many levels. Music, choreography, lyrics and humour. An homage to the elder statesmen of this genre but updated. Singing about 'my girl' but it's the opposite of the classic while sampling the moves of The Temptations. Best of all, they bring back melody and harmony to pop.
LOVE 💕!!! They bring back ALL the Ol Skool feels!!! With a snap and a twist !   BITCH🤣🤣🤣
wtf Im a pack a day smoker now
Good vibes
Man Anderson and Bruno!!!! Dropping Classics! I feel like I’m in my Parents Era listening to this!, brings back memories of being in the backseat on them late night rides home.
Ho. Ly. Shit!!! This is so dope!!
😂😂😂
Bruno threw the grenade back
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A letra é machista e misógina
A lot of females commenting and dont even know the real vibe.  the fellas who sharing and send this to another fella who been there smoking out the window.  That’s the real vibe.
To the streets with her..
Bruno: "This bitch got me paying her rent, paying for trips, diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists"   ME: 🗣 RUN THAT SHIT BACK!!!
Bruno went from I'll catch a grenade for ya to throwing it back
Kkkkk maravilhoso
The album is already a certified classic
Soon as you think all hope for music is lost Silk Sonic Saves the day what an amazing group.
shit is nice...like Maxwell in the 90s.
Where can I find Anderson .Paak glasses pleaseeeee
Come on bro....leave that girl .
I never why people like Bruno Mars. I didn’t understand, but honeeeeeny I’m a fan. This took me back to those daze when music was goodt. Love all the songs that been released so far from the cd.
1:43 my ears here here I am all alone, but my brain says here I am on the floor.
They needed good money after paying her rent and ended up giving us a classic.
Anderson kills me everytime
Travis Scott on stage lookin like 1:44
Silk Sonic was the best thing of 2021
That shit got stuck on a loop for days now wtf❤❤❤❤
I absolutely love it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Wowww thoroughly enjoyed this video the guys in the back are grovinnnnn I love this video absolutely everything is on pointy
Anderson 🎶"ohhhh"🎶 Muito delícia esse som, amando  💞💞💞💞💞💞💞 A bateria arrasaaaaaa
There demeanor in this song reminds me of David Ruffin
!!! " THIS BITCH " !!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
choreo's giving new edition and i'm here for it <3
He needs to do a song with Cody Chesnutt!! Done
Guapo 😘😘
What is that? Velvet!!
Where's the DIVERSITY!
How does this song have dislikes???
the best music video i've ever seen!!!
Is this a JOKE 😹😩💀
When Anderson lays on the ground, but makes sure the ciggie doesn’t burn the carpet 😂
holy shit
Superb. These guys crack me up. So so talented. Nice job!
The best part is this isn't very different from Anderson Paak and Bruno's music respectively.
Melodically this song is the best of their first 3 singles. This is a Grammy-winning song honestly.
every single moment of hearing this music is amazing. WOW
Oooohhhh NOooooo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9xOXJIDj6I
LOL🔥💯😀
He went from taking grenades to calling women female dogs 😂
Alternative title she belongs to the streets 😂😂
One of these girls done pissed Bruno off something fierce😂😂😂
i loveeeeee thisssss
WAIT THIS IS REAL ??? 💀💀
superb!!!!!
He throwin the grenade back at dat bitch
Great is a small word to describe this.. Thank you guys. You made my day.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Buena music
This is the theme song for all them NBA players paying for child support.
Bruno did it again
Anderson said what I want to say when I'm really, really pissed,  "I hope you find whatever it is you need. But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walking 'round barefoot in these streets!"  YEEEESSSS!
I knew this collaboration would be as dynamite, fukn awesome
Rami Malek should play Bruno Mars in a movie - they look the same.
"not to be dramatic but I wanna die" LMAO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
SAUSGE FEST ?? THIS IS, I BELIEVE AT LEAST 2 VIDEOS BY BRUNO MARS WITH ZERO OR ALMOST ZERO HOT LADIES, WOULD IT KILL HIM TO THROW SOME COIN AT THE LADIES AND HELP THEM OUT A BIT ??
I like how in every line they're managing to say "She belongs to the streets" without actually saying it LOL
This song is about dating a Sagittarius
Okaaaaaaaay 😅😅😅😅
When I first heard “This Bitch” I died!😂🤣😂🤣
Du looooooourd ce morceau 🔥🔥🔥👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Omg why he on the floor like that🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dancing while you hang you cigar aint easy, man.
Damn bruno really threw those grenades back 🤣🤣🤣
Bruno is so damn smooth, even when he mad 🥰🥰🥰
I swear, I was waiting on the line saying "She got me phucked up" and "She is for the streets" - would have been EPIC!
DIRECT 🇧🇷✍🏼
"She Belong to Everybody" - Cityboys
woWWWWWWWW
I don't thnk the door is open anymore.
I legit feel like this happened to Anderson and then he told the story to Bruno, and now Bruno narrating and Anderson acting out the story to their freinds which is us and all of us just having a good time laughing for their jokes. 😂😭♥️
This song is hilarious 😆 th
biggest diss track in history maybe?
I love the song and the vibe it gives
Sheeesh
I need them to keep making music for another 40 years
Bruno has been feisty sense he got that mustache
Takes me way back to the good old days.T.R.O.Y. Bruno N Pac making music for grown folks..
Yassss so retroooo
omg my ear is melting XD
Why is this look so hot on bruno
I’m hollering 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why can I see Steve from American dad singing this
Good yeah!!
THIS IS AWESOMWNMEMENENE
This got me cracking up! I love how he PERFECTLY mixed that ole school sound and even dance moves with new school way of calling somebody out. Dude! This is great
It would take a genius to use the phrase "This Bitch..." in an R&B song and make it work. Done and done.
I need this album in my liiiife
I need the whole album on vinyl.  IMMEDIATELY ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I can say that baby fathers and broken brothers blasting this song fatefully
Whoever got these two in a room together is a genius 😂 Struck gold
Man the melody is great.
Bro by the end of this year this is gonna be one of the most watched music videos of all time
Is there anything Bruno and Anderson Paak can't do??
The first "THIS B^ITCH...." never laughed so at a song😂
Anderson Paak facial expressions do it for me, every time.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
More music like this pls 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Soo they going to do the Nutty professor dance too lol Hercules! Hercules!
Bruno Mars is just everything
Bruno mars is a phenomenon, he can make any style of music he wants and he's doing it so right, this tune is dope btw
⭐️⭐️⭐️
Bruno sick of y’all lol 😂
He not leaving the door open no more
Bruno Mars with that thin mustache singing in a piercing falsetto  is a triple victory for me.
Excelente.!!  Muy buena música!! Es como volver a los inicios
If this ain't gonna get 1billion views than idk man
He really went from “ imma leave the door open “ to “ imma change the door locks “
Dope!!!!
Lol
We're watching history take place live.
Omg i love this💜💜💜💜👌👌👌
I know we all wanted him to say "belong to the streets"
the 9 thousand dislikes are from the chicks they singin about
Love the song and its melody, but hate how its glorifying smoking.
HELLOOOOOOOO
Yes, love what they’re doing.
This song gives me early 70s Soul Train Vibes, and like McDonald's: I AM LOVIN' IT! <3
bobby Womack looking ass smooth lol
He threw the grenade back
Sponsored by Newport lol
The dude in the back left? My future husband, after I divorce this 30 year one!!!😁😁😁👍👍👍

They were definitely fucking around when they made this song😂 gotta love it man
Fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bruno is a DAMN BEAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well deserved #1 spot. Goated.
Give it up already Music industry. The Music sucks ,,,,, really bad.

Somebody really must have hurt you Bruno Mars What was her name That's the vibe I'm getting
Didn't know bruno's into a boyband as well
I just know this is gonna be one of those songs that I'm gonna listen when I'm older and get nostalgia

I hope she has everything she needs but I also hope she’s walking around here barefoot in these streets hahahahaha
Listened a few times now and I was WRONG. The lyrics are FANTASTIC. If this doesn’t goto and stay at number one, you all gone cray cray!!
Would anyone else buy this new Silk Sonic album on vinyl?! We gotta show Bruno and Anderson the people want this album on vinyl!
This song should be called 'A Simp Awakening'
Im amazed!! Best Duo out here !!
The chemistry between Anderson and Bruno mars is electrifying!
Sorry Bruno, but u got on the wrong track for a while
1:37  he really said "im going to catch a grenade for you " to " I'm going to throw the grenade at you" 💀
This project is the definition of perfect. OMG i love this song/video 😭😭😭
I’m in love 🤩🤩🤩

I was fully expecting the slide step out for the change in singers. Come on Bruno!
“DIS B****”!! 😂😂😂😂😂
EU AMEI MUITO KKKKKKKKK
Que música boa
Someone said that Kevin Hart is one of the back up dancers here but I don't see it...he seems to think I'm wrong and he's right lol
¿Algún habla hispano que me diga que género tan hermoso en el que se inspira Bruno y su productora es este?
Too much talent
Perfeito demais ♡♡♡
🐐
This made my day 🤣🤣 just iconic 🌸🦋🤍 Old souls in the 21st century is epic 💯🥰

It gets better everytime you listen..
😂 1:00 that old skool fade in fade out image. Classic
This album is going to be insane.
These guys are amazing. So amazing.
That was really nice
Bruno Mars singing with so much passion I guess no more Versace on the floor no catching grenades but now throwing them no more open door😂😪
This is HILARIOUS!!
i love
My man went from “I hope you’re on the other side talking to me too” to “I hope to never hear this B!tch’s voice ever again!” 🤣😂 PURE GOLD!
Jeff Bezos Type beat
The true essence of R&B Music is on its way back. Dance steps, harmony, lyrically sound, a meaning, and being cool. DAMNIT these Bruthas did it. Thank you!
I suggest locking the door next time instead of leaving it open. I'm just sayin!
This feels like a smoother sexier version of Kanye West's Golddigger.. these guys killed it much 💕
Talent at its highest peak!!! OMG! Watching Listening to these guys is so satisfying! I’m blown away! Thanks guys for bringing back MUSIC in it’s real trueness!!! I almost gave up on the silly music that’s been on air these days! After 21 good years of listening to all kinds of shitty music I must say this! This is pure raw beauty!! You guys are a masterpiece!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Simpin to pimpin
Anderson Paak giving me Eddie Griffin vibes
I am 47 years old and I grow up with the 70's and 80's vibe. This brings me back in time but still with 2021 touch. This is utterly among the best shit i ever heard. Epic!
they have to be smoking some sort of drugs because this song is definitely LACED!!!!!!!!!
This goes so hard
Damn whoever this b!tch is, pissed off bruno cuz I have never seen this side of him lol 😂
They are stupid!!😂😂 That are having the most fun, I love it!
This is what happens when you listen to Future, Sugafree 🤣
Pretty hard to take the song off me head... So smooth!
https://youtube.com/shorts/DvCh3Ija8Qc?feature=share
This joint is fire 🔥 I don’t care what nobody says, this that straight funk , finally some real R&B
After Anderson .Paak dramatically fainted, layed on the floor for two hour's and than got up on cue for his next verse,  I automatically dramatically passed out afterwards... "And the best dramatic faint in a video of 2021 goes to Anderson .Paak from Silk Sonic" 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
The cinematography is perfection
“I hope your triflin’ ass is walking round barefoot in these streets!!!”   Me to my triflin ex - all day, every day 🤣👏🏽
ITS ANDERSON PAAK DEAD ON THE FLOOR FOR ME 😆😆😆😆THIS VID IS HILARIOUS
ME ENCANTAAAAAAAA
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💥💥💥💥💥🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
The king has returned

He's throwing grenades now not catching anymore
What a time to be going through a breakup. This song couldn’t have come out in a better point in my life.
She belongs to the skreetz!
it's him vs the weeknd, they are both going back to older era's of music.
What is the album name ?
Bruno throwing the grenade back at her
From dripping in finesse to just got finessed.
Bro am I the only one who thought when Paak first sang "diamonds on her neck, Diamonds on her wrist, and here I am all aloneeeeee" the camera movement and the way he sang It just made the moment fit perfectly with the vibe of the song!! so good bro
I just love the way Bruno says “this bitch” rewind that back 🤣
He really enjoy at this  moment 2:02
h*ly smoky macarony this is my new favorite song so cool i love the parts that bothe bruno and paak say this b*tch got me paying the rent
and that cigarette stayed in his hand the whole time
That’s the hardest “this bitch” ever
Finally music worthy of breaking the rewind button.
LOVE THIS SHIT! MY# 1 FAVORIATE BAND!!!!!!!!!!! NODDEN MY HEAD!!!!!
tobacco industry must've paid them millions
YYYEEEESSSSSIIIIRRRRR!!!!!!
Four Tops and the Temps would be proud of this homage
You need to add lil duval and the recipe is complete. 💎
god damn bruno is so sexy
I hear elements of the Whispers, The Jackson Five, The Sylvers, Motown and the Philly Sound.  The dance steps reminds me  of New Edition and the Temptations. Great song!!! Keep em’ coming!!!!
I feel it🍃💨
Como olvidar cuando bruno y anderson estuvieron en el show de las estrella. Donde esta Jorge barón?
Awesome!!!Fantastic!!! Can't wait for a live concert!!!
She belongs to the streets🥴
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
SHES FOR THE STREETS lol
Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. There is no other intermediary. May Jesus Bless you, trust Him, give your life - and He will take care of it :pray Convert yourself and believe in the Gospel - Romans 10 8-10 But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,”[a](A) that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: 9 If you declare(B) with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,”(C) and believe(D) in your heart that God raised him from the dead,(E) you will be saved.(F) 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.♡.
Can't stop listening to this song! This is soo gooood!
music video of the year?
Shi... This slaps tho
Hercules......👞👞👞🥾
Silk Sonic and Call Me if You Get Lost better win all the Grammys they have in the back lol
😍😍😍😍
My boy threw that grenade right back at em
Bruno, please make a Christmas song! It will be lit!
Singing while smoking 😂😂😂😂 I wanna marry you Bruno 🥰🥰🥰
This bitch ......Anderson in the camera 😲 Me: rewind!❣💯  I was not prepared
We need a new Mercedes type, the Benzo instead of Benz. Vintage style, color beige inside. Benchstyle for the seats
Made my day! 😄
😂😂😂
PURITO ARTE
1:36 EPIC when Anderson Paak goes down on the floor, I find it so funny.
Лучшая песня за последний год
I'm cracking up...🤣🤣🤣🤣
THE HATE ARE COMING FROM THE RAPPERS THEY CANT STAND MOTO MUSIC
Is it just me, or does this song seem a bit outdated?  I mean glorifying cigarette smoking as a way of coping with stress and calling a woman a derogatory name like Bitch, seems to be straight out of the 1950's.  I love the composition as well as a voices, but the message is a bit disappointing.
Damn Funny
this song is so smooooooth and groovy with on point  harmony
He shouldn’t have left the door open 😭
1:17 The cameraman is cool...
"but I also hope that yo triflin ahh is walkin round bear foot in deez streets" that part had me weak
I love Bruno Mars. Wooouuu! He is awsome.
Will Smith plays this every morning…😭😭
Ohh shit Na this my mf jam.
Thank you for making these masterpieces ......!!!!!
bruno said no more simping
The Runs and the harmonies on this song is astounding.. Bruno sounds EXACT same like he does live and recording.🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍
LMAOOO YES I LOVE THIS SONG!! SO GOOD
If he called me a bitch like that I wouldn't even mind tbh
have been watching this non stop to the point that I can memorize their steps 😩
Bruno should make a song with masego
I'm responsible for at least 1 million of these views! 🤣❤❤❤
THIS BITCH!!!!.....every man done said it🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best way to say she belong to the streets
the turn Anderson did when he screams *"LOVE YA"* PLZ!!!
How, sway??? So much 🔥🔥
This pair is literally the prototype for dynamic duos. Who knew two incredibly talented artists would not only compliment each other so well, but also elevate one another to new heights on each and every collaboration. Just so smooth every damn time. I hope I can continue to improve and refine my music for many years to come just like Bruno and Anderson have! I may never be as talented or charming as either of them (or funny) but I am still always inspired by their ambition and commitment to their craft. Bravo!
check Love Nwantiti by Ckay, Soundgasm by Rema, Monalisa by Lojay, Alcohol by Joeboy, Away By Oxlade and High by Adekunle baby, Big Thug Boys by AV..  you'll be back to thank me

Bruno Mars is a music genius.

I have been waiting this song for a long Now I see how bruno can do better 😘
The fact that they are singing their faces off and I am still CACKLING! 😂 Sirs, there is a trumpet being played by Eddie Murphy in your throat! Cuz how????!
This song funny af, meme ready 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Damn that music video is so smooth! King of retro theme, indeed!
march: leave door open november: *SHIT, CHANGE THE LOCKS FAST!*
Bruno Mars went from. I think I want to mary you to I'll throw my lit cigar at you
2021 Anthem for Will Smith
That’s one way to say She Belongs To The Streets🤣🤣
“Got her bad ass kids running round my whole crib like it’s Chucky Cheese” man that line is epic cause most men can relate lol
I need that suit
got damn silk sonic is my shit!
She belongs to the streets
I need the Silk Sonic Album!!!
Not for nothing, I never expected this collabo to produce such amazing contributions to soul and R&B. This collaboration is not just a coming together of two talents. The music they have produced together is noteworthy and demands appreciation from even the most strict R&B enthusiasts.
Best Band EVER!!!!!!
I need Kendrick on the remix
Why am i smiling for no reason at all? what a masterpiece!
what happened to catching a grenade
GENIAL ❤️
literally holding that cigarette like how my mom does when stressin
This song is a fucking masterpiece I felt every word and yet laughed it’s so old school like YESSSSS YESSS YESSSSS
Damn 8k people with no sense of good music
Can't wait to see how Kidz Bop is going to edit this song for their album.
He threw that grenade right back
Bruno Mars sucks. period.
1:33
Stupid genius and legendary at the same time love it.

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 This B.I.T.C.H.  got me paying her rent.....
this is the new version of easy lover of Phil collins <3
I think it was the kids that was the breaking point🤣🤣🤣 Bruno like “f them kids”
This is dubbed the salty e-girl simp anthem. 😂
They literally went from "skate to me"  to "I hope you trip and fall"
Shhhhhhmokinout the window 😂😂😂
"This b*tch got me paying her rent" lmfao
smoking while singing , is it possible ?
It’s always gonna be the this bitch for me
This has The Manhattans - kiss and say goodbye vibes all over it. Check it out 😅
💗💗💗💗💗🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song gives me the elevated version of “she belongs to the STREETS”
Brilliant!!!  🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best video ever!
So we not getting a vinyl out of this vibe and experience? I need the album spinning on my record player.

I got a feeling this will be album of the year!!!
Something about this song puts me in hardcore lovey mood.
Da nigga Nd det cigaret stayed lit da whole video
This is way too funny!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love this song ! 🎧 🎶 ❤️

😍👏👏👏👏👏👏
This is the reason why i love BRUNO MARS 😊
We need Bruno MARS to make more songs to saved the EARTH from toxic music
Damn a cigarette has never looked soo good lol
잘하내
But seriously though, If the girl screaming "Hercules" on the bed, my ding-dong would deflated and I will died of laughing.
This song will be hits  You know bruno mars is a legend  All songs he had are truly good
Yo only Bruno Mars would have figured a classier way to say she belongs to the streets
How many of you are high right now?🙆‍♂️
This is something to behold as dear …. Good goodness….
A masterpiece
I wish I could be as good as you at singing so that I can convey clearly how I feel.
Bruno said it with his WHOLE chest!
Nah SHE BELONG TO THE STREETS
Apa gw kesasar disini...🕺🕺🕺
Another classic
the count starts 1 milion ✔️ 2 milions ✔️ 3 milions ✔️ 4 milions ✔️ 5 milions ✔️ 6 milions ✔️ 7 milions ✔️ 8 milions ✔️ 9 milions ✔️ 10 milion 🕺 11 milions ✔️ 12 milions ✔️ 13 milions ✔️ 14 milions✔️ 15 milions ✔️ 16 milions✔️ 17 milions ✔️ 18 milions ✔️ 19 milions ✔️ 20 milion 🕺 21 milions ✔ 22 milions ✔ 23 milions ✔ 24 milions ✔ 25 milions ✔
When he turned his head sideways and pointed that cigarette. I felt that. I’d be stressed out too if I had to pay for her rent, trip, diamonds on her wrist and her neck.

When I tell you I LOVE this song!!! It is so freaking hilarious and dope!!! Kudos fellas! Y’all did it again. I have listened to this song I don’t know how many times since hearing it for the first time a few days ago. The whole video & song is a vibe!!!

#1 on trending sheesh
WHO HURT YOU BABYYY
¡Hermoso!
Anderson really on the floor lmao
this is cute
Beast 🔥🎤🔥
he started throwing the damn grenades back
is it just me or does Bruno look like he's been hitting the drugs a little too hard??? lol
Pretty sure I account for 10,000 of the views on this video alone
Bruno se ve bien crikoso en este video 🤣🤣🤣🤣 but he is the best! I love everything that he do. He’s a great artist!! Claps for him!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
.Paak said, “Ooh, noo.” 😂
This may be the greatest video EVER made!  LOL!!
Why do comedy songs sound so much better than the artist’s soundtrack 😂😂😂😂😂  Like the American dad “virgin” by weekend
I’ve never related to a song so much 😂😅
Yaaaassss!!!!!! 🎵🤣❤️
This is what happens when you leave  the door open
Damn !!!!! 😍😍😍
Dude went from I'll catch a grenade for ya to I'll throw one at you
🇧🇷 like!
I'm sorry but did this foo say " got her bad ass kids running around my house like it's Chuck E Cheese". Lmaooo yepp Bruno some different now🤣🤣.
It the “THIS B*TCH GOT ME” for me 😂😂 I am completely satisfied with this 😂😂💯💯
esperando que Jk cante en un vlive esto jajaj :))
SOLIDDDD
<33333
He threw the grande back, so sad.
He went from "Versace on the floor" to "there's the door".
It's just good to see how they're just enjoying making music together. No sense of competition, no tension. Just good music.
this is the R&B way of saying "she belong the streets"
I don't know what song  this song reminds me of.....  Bruno must never sound like yesterday,no matter what he does. All talents reach plateau,not artistry.  I know he's an artist.
When he pops back up I snorted while laughing
Legendary said their cigarettes never burned out
Hercules. Hercules. Hercules. 🤣🤣🤣
Smokin... 🔥🔥🔥
We are witnessing the birth of a damn Grammy! It just has to be!
NO SMOKING:)
These kind of vibes was very very very satisfying ✨
Went from "take my wallet if you want it" to "bitch gimme my damn wallet back"
funky af
☺️
Dope
Lyrics is legendary
The new Jackson 5
guys a new song is out that means a new cupcakke remix??
Silky smooth!
When he said she got her bad ass kids running round my house like it's Chuck E. Cheese, I hit the floor! This is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
Bruno fuckin ranting while paaks just laid out LMAO
Damn, they stay MAKING BANGERS.
have you tried a Dominican, Mr. Mars?
LMAO
Lol I can’t wait for this album
The real question is who hurt Bruno Mars? He went from singing about killing himself to This Bitch. <3
Dis Bish! 🚬🥴
I'm not into this kind of music. More like a metal or electronic guy. But the flow and atmosphere is astonishing
the funk is back❤️❤️❤️
Loving this got my wanting to watch the nutty professor with the hercules verse
They don’t miss! 🔥
yes
This song is everything
🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
bruno never fails to amaze us
They so smooth loll
Dis….. Bitch…. got me paying her rent
"This b!tch got me" is now one of the greatest 4 words in music history!
Brother: have you heard Bruno Mars new song?   Me: I don’t think so  Brother: well he’s not singing songs about catching grenades for girls anymore
F***ING Mint the story reminds me of a song from orange juice jones

Anderson and Bruno... what beauty has come from these two since they've met (also silk sonic <3)
I know women salty off is song
Dang they killed that!!!
Anderson looking like a young Bobby Womack lol
I'm amazed how no one has yet to mention the Nutty Professor reference! Leave it up to Silk Sonic to turn a classic fat joke into something so sexy. Pure talent right there!

Anderson Paak: “I don’t want to be dramatic, but I wanna die.” Also him: *Proceeds to do the absolute most* 😂😂😂

Bruno Mars needs to be protected at all cost🥺....matter of fact they all do🥺
From “leave the door open” to “Smokin out the window” real quick 😂
smoking as can be
I'm getting old vibe and I love it 🦋🦋
this s the level of sexy i aspire to reach. I need a man all in his feelings going crazy  like this let me go outside and go exercise #toxica #toxic #sexyass

This group thingy works because they are both gifted in talent yet  humble about it. No huge egos
Lmao this song is a vibe and funny at the same lol
I'm pretty sure, bruno mars Michael jackson son...
Is Anderson on the drums of the recording?
NEED TO ADD, IF  SILK SONIC  DONT WIN ALBUM OF THE YEAR I WLL NEVER WATCH A MUSIC REWARD SHOW ITS FIX THEN

Great song to vibe with while smoking
i've listened to this at least 20 times today
Yall aint listened to the Paak Nxworries tape and it shows 🤣🤣🤣
They did it again
Anderson just laying there is hilarious
Bruno has the best rhythm when he does the little dance parts. The tall guy in the back is having a GREAT time.
the collab i never knew i needed
Bruno, you are allllllll that, and a lobster tail! Baby you are so smooth. I can't wait untill you are in Los Angeles, i will be their front and center. You are truly whats known as an entertainer!!!!💖
Th3 best♡♡♡
Not me physically sweating this song and video 🧊👏🏽
They are using the exact same formula as the 70s and early 80s and it's a hit this should show you nothing never goes out of style completely it just take the right people to do it and these are the only two from this generation I guess
We bringin soul train back?
Bruno: "Got her bad ass kids running around my crib like it's chucky cheese"   ME: 🗣 RUN THAT SHIT BACK!!!
So this song is about some bitches 😊
After leave the door open and skate now this??? LSS again
I love how Bruno Mars made a song for kpop stans  "This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone)"
Ohh noooo !  Whooaah whhoooawhh 😂
This is like the simp anthem.
lmaoo this song
Masterpiece🔥
Is “this bitch” the same girl that left the door open… 💄💋
1:43 new meme format, calling it
This is gold. 😭😂😂
Its the Badass kids running around his crib like its Chuck E Cheese 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wonder how long it'll be before "this b*tch" becomes a reaction meme on tiktok...
Fantastic 😆
Bruno ain’t catching no mo grenades, he throwing them at bitches now 😭😭
I NEED ALL of this mans music, yeah, I been sleepin on bruno, I will accept my lashes.
Man BRUNO 🥂
ah yes ._. just like the *TREASURE* vibe
I HOPE YOUR TRIFLING ASS IS WALKING AROUND BAREFOOT ON THE STREETS
yoohhh brooo bruno mars gottt backckkk achkkkk, this taste of music suits you bestt bruno
I think this man is going backwards 😆 I am not complaining ~ we need more people showing us how beautiful old music is~
Top🤣
HBCU bands where you at????
It was perfect Bruno. Your partnership with Silk Sonic is wonderful, I loved the costume, especially your glasses, now I'm just waiting for the album release. I loved the clip. @Bruno Mars
🤣🤣🤣
I lost it seeing Paak on the floor.   Hahahah..🤣
that dance so slow soft and steady.. no need rush or to fast, chilllll.. just feel..
They’ve done it again…..this time with a little comedy, and it’s okay! They make you really appreciate being a “old schooler” and enjoy the nostalgia of when music was real and not filled with a lot of technical rhythm, beats and auto tunes. Love this ♥️♥️.
This song is everything 🤣🤣
He threw that bomb right back lol
Bruno Mars is a legend
Wait a minute This love started out so timid and so sweet But now she got me smoking out the window  Must have spent 35 45 thousand up in tiffany’s (ooh no) Got her badass kids running around my whole crib Like it’s chuck e. Cheese (woahh) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the ufc Can’t believe it (can’t believe it) I am in disbelief  This MISS got me paying her rent, paying for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I am so cold, I am so cold You got me out here  Smoking out the window (smoking out the window) Singin’ how could she do this too me? How could she do this too me? I thought that girl belonged too only me But I was wrong ‘cuz she belong too everybody, everybody  Just the other night She was gripping on me tight Screamin’ hercules Hercules, hercules Got me in the club looking for a new love Someone help me please Help me please, help me please Baby, why you doing this? Why you doing this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This MISS got me paying her rent, paying for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I am so cold, I am so cold You got me out here  Smoking out the window (smoking out the window of the benzo, the benzo) Singin’ how could she do this too me? (how?) How could you do this too me? I thought that girl belonged too only me One things fasho, one things fasho But I was wrong (I was wrong) ‘cuz she belong to everybody Everybody (she belong too Yeahh she belong too everybody That girl there, she belong too everybody  Ooh no Look here baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin’ a^s is walking Around bare foot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that You ain’t right here with me Now I gotta give you back Gotta give you back Too the city, ooh you got me  Smoking out the window Singin’ how could she do this too me? How could you? How could you do this, baby? I thought that girl belonged too only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) ‘cuz she belong too everybody, everybody (she belong) Yeah! She belong too everybody She belong too everybody Ooh
Penasaran berapa roko yg dinyalain pas buat video klip ini hehe😁
Him laying on the floor is everything. Not at all dramatic
What's the thing with the cigarette?  Probably P*ilip M*rris sponsored the video clip. :-)
Trop bon pour le moral!
It’s too late now, but if you was my man I wouldn’t do that to you Bruno! 😘🤙🏽🌺♥️
Bruno Mars never once made a bad song.  King. 👑👑👑👑
I love everything about this video and song. The world needs some of that smooth 70s sound
Move over, fool!!!! The lay out, took me out!!!!
out of all the singles this one hits different
Who else is here from TikTok ?! LOL
genius
Put Keemy Casanova on this🤣
Damn I didnt know Bruno Mars was also a drummer
Is this supposed to be a parody of 70's soul music?
Este es un rolón 🔥
Bruno went from catching grenades to smoking out the window😂
Bruno Mars the best 💃💃💃

It’s the Hercules part for me. Anderson how you fall to the grown all dramatic like that 😂😂 THIS BITCH ! Bruno damn
Brono mars musique rap
From "Catching a Grenade for you" to "This B*tch"
I wondered how many cigarettes they light up to shoot this video, mine didn't last 3mins 20secs while smoking out the window.
Gave Bruno a cigarette and he went H.A.M!!!!
The hand gestures tells everything 😂
This 5hit is weird!
I love the music blend of Bruno Mars,Anderson Paak and Silk Sonic! And the great upbeat lyrics as well!!!!!👏👏👏⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️❤️❤️❤️
Bringing sadness to a whole new level 😂, she will regret after hearing this masterpiece bru
dude went from  "catch a grenade for ya" to  "This bitch got me payin her rent, payin for trips"
This is gonna be a classic
Brought to you proudly by Phillip Morris
What do you think about this   ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCSUKIhjevo&t=8s&ab_channel=LivingWaters ?
Who can agree this is a hit
He threw that grenade right back
Missed opportunity to say belongs to the streets
This song is so freaking sad , man .
to the all low elo player. just smoke the windows 😑
He did not just play dead on the floor ! 🤭😂😂😂😂
In concert you need to play Marry Me before it.
I dunno who "this b@#ch" is but she really got Bruno pressed.
Brilliant love it 😍
I need y'all to do a song with CeeLo green
The harmonies are heavenly!
I just have to say I have NEVER bopped so darn hard in my life to hearing a song for the first time, thank you SOOOO much for continuing this beautiful genre of music ! Stay blessed❤️‍🔥
DAMN
This cd they bought to drop is gonna be 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trust Bruno to make Smoking look so good
Good ol vibe
https://youtu.be/Enzj9nTHiEc
:D
I need them to have a video for all of the tracks on this album
This is hilarious       i love it.
This tour gon be the greatest thing to ever grace us
November 12th can't get here quick enough. The Album drops
Whens Bruno Mars Spanish album coming out
So fly!
How you go from I'm gonna leave the door open to I'm about to change the locks on yo ass.
Lol 1:32 is just hilarious. Now I knew Anderson was hilarious when he did India Shawn's video but it's insane that I'm in awe and cracking up at the same time. I can't wait for my cd to arrive and it better not be broken. Lol the way he turned around after he wished her barefoot walking lol 😆 😂 🤣 😅
Wow, the number of thumbs down is shocking to me, wondering how many are from the very type of woman they're singing about (so eloquently I must add)?  I can't stop loving this song seriously.  There's so much message beneathe the nostalgic setting.  These days, the disgustly filthy music coming out is basically influencing young women to be rachet and savage individuals.  Today's culture literally glamourizes this behavior.  But it's really something that's shameful and demoralizing.  This song (very tactfully) delivers that message.  Gold diggers, REPENT!  🤣😂😄😆😄.  But you didn't hear that from me cause I ain't one to gossip 🤫.  So I'll just play it one more time and that it!
smoother than 10 baby bottoms
Ok
Flawlessly Victory
"Bad A** kids running around like it Chuckie Cheese" had me
Tooissimoooooooos
🙆🏽‍♀️😁❤️‍🔥😂
The nigga is still swaggy
Why does this make perfect sense to me?  After I cleaned up the crib, and left the door open for you to come over.  Then, I admired yo "fine ass" while you were out there skating, and now you act a fool and leave me all alone?  Naw, I ain't happy, and since you didn't appreciate all I did, yeah I hope yo ass is bare foot in dem streets.  Sounds about right.
Oh Lawd he dead
Cant get better than this 😄
The choreographer of this video deserves a VMA!  OMG, the stomp at "Hercules, Hercules!". Genius I tell you.
the way he dead on the floor got me 💀💀
"She belongs to the streets" the theme song
this the good stuff
This bangs🔥🔥on repeat
Lmao
No one:... Not a single soul:... Silk Sonic: 🗣THIS BITCH!!!
Feels like a crime that Paak didn't man the kit but him dying had me on the floor too
Another one 😂😂😂😂 this funny and dope tho 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
“She belongs to the streets” in song form
No one: Depressed people: *1:33*
Their 1st song together mentions a DOOR. Now its a WINDOW. Soon we could be hearing about a WALL or a ROOF in one of the songs from their new album. 😂
I can tell how young everyone in the comment section is. You guys aren't seeing the true genius behind this music. It's the one and only Bootsy Collins.
The next single named would be something about the roof, wall, floor etc. 🤣 Btw, I gonna be your fans
pampy is a W streamer idc          also im not begging to be unbanned im still going to watch the streams
Omg im damn dead now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Anderson Pak bringing the theatrics
They dance and sing like butter
Ninoy Aquino 1:44
♥️♥️♥️
holy moly its now no.2 trending in music ! 😩😅
🦅
This is the funniest mv I've ever seen 😆 😂
I know for a fact this song and music video gonna be one of Steve Harvey's favorite. And he gonna buy the album
2:59
El corto aqui https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwk1xj3-3bE y El Soundtrack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewyW__dEEzA
Only two drags from a whole cigarette. Wasteful! :)
I cracked up when Anderson .Paak feigned "dying" and then they showed him flat on the floor - in the shape of a crime scene chalk outline! And then he popped up and took the mike.     On the serious side, the coordination of those moves is flawless and they look GREAT!
Na vida eu sou o Anderson .Paak que para pra tirar um cochilo no meio do clipe hahaha
Bruno never fails 👍
This so Motown. Great performance
i ammm addictedddddd to thisssss
This song and video deserves a lot more 😂
Silk Sonic is saving R&B✊🏾✌🏾🌟
THIS IS LITERAL PERFECTION
Fryer dam good project
This song is a cut and Bruno never sounded better. But now, and because "bitch" is said twice and by two different men, in a song about a woman doing a man wrong, stand back and watch the Social Justice Warriors and man-hating skanks try to get it banned from all airplay and make false accusations about all four men involved.  That's what they get for not putting halos over the heads of absolutely every woman alive on the planet with their lyrics.  Because in our world, circa 2021, it's okay for women like Beyonce to record absolute shit like "...to the left, to the left..." but it's never okay for a man to record a song about and call out an actual triflin' bitch because men aren't even supposed to defend themselves when a woman physically attacks them; let alone say anything bad about women no matter how abundantly true it may be. Oh well fellas, it was cool while it lasted. Bring a lunch when you're at the employment security office
Bruh, someone did Bruno Mars dirty 😅
Me right now wow 😅🤣🤣This Hits a dopalicious spot playa *actually smoking out the window listening to this masterpiece experience😎🤣 laughing for the same reasons.* We make light of the deeper truths of life & laugh at our pain beautifully in song even in Harmony.
Que homem lindo ❤️
Who hurt 🤕  my man Bruno.
look bruno idk what type of drugs youve been putting in your songs all these years but i'm HOOKED please give me more
Masterpiece! Michael Jackson lives in Bruno Mars!
This some playa shit lol
Bruno Mars never dissapoint me😍
I can't stop watching  video Bruno and Anderson Park got me
Adding the cigarettes is stupid. Cool song, but with that it looks like a parody. Yes, the name of the song has the word "smokin" in it. So? Audio version is better this time.
😍
Love it 😊
It is the fake fainting that got me. Hahahaha 🤣
💓Bruno =Love 💓😘
What a meme generator this song is, but they singing facts Tho. Stay strong kings🤣🤣🤣
Who else is here from TikTok 🤣
Love
how do they maintain that great voices while smoking cigarette? Teach me how pls?
I love this, man.
Bruno was holding that cigarette like one of my uncles trying to explain something to me🤣🤣🤣🤣
Searched bruno's age i was shocked thought he's 25 or somethin
https://youtu.be/aFEXuvyLNB8
Bruno Mars out there tired of them b**ches. Ain't no catchin grenades for these ho's nomo. 😂
Damn Bruno who hurt you? My man went from “im dripping In Finesse” to “i just got finessed”😭
When Anderson said the hook, he was singing. Bruno was venting a little bit
It just real american emotion itself.            I guess.
They messed around and made an anthem for dudes🤣🤣
Amazing singer as always 👍🎵🎵
from "I'll catch a grenade for ya" to--
💞💞💞
🤩🔥🔥🔥 Welp...They've done it AGAIN! I'm ALLERGIC to Cigarettes and was tempted to light 1 up and "wave my hands in the air...and wave 'em like I just don't care" to THIS!!! 🚬👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾 LMAO...Wow, what a Comical Heartbreaking VIBE!!! 💔🎶😂🤣😂 #ACHOO 🗣️❤️ #NEWSCHOOLCLASSIC 📻🎶
1:42 How on earth did they keep a straight face during this part? xDD
"Smokin Out The Window"  Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
i know this is probably ironic but im so gonna sing it non ironically
That's the world we need ... Groovin' on again.
anyone who thinks Anderson .Paak wasn't the bigger influence on this song, is totally unfamiliar with his music. (Suede, Bubblin, Am I wrong, Silicon valley...  I could keep going) Let's not forget he's won a Grammy on his own.  Props to Andy & Bruno... otherwise this would be more poppish bs.
Let these gods rule the world. Those jumping yo-yos BTS’ body contorsions are so old and boring! There’s not one tune or move that Bruno Mars did wrong, and it’s been over 20 years. A genius without peers.
Bruno Mars is a genius. Michael and Prince have a starlit successor.
the sharp B in "bitch" and cigarette, Bruno is throwing that grenade back to her. 😭😭
"Got me in a jam with her ex man in the UFC" this always takes me the f out, LOL
bro stopped talking to the moon
i really thought he was suddenly got unconcious...
All that was missing was someone saying “You raggedy bitch”🤣🤣🤣🤣
This song is needed my ladies needs wake up call.
HERCULES HERCULES! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Pure Masterpiece !!!
This song is fire but the video is funny as hell. Lol
Ngerokok di jendela aja jd lagu, aku aja ngrokok smbil be ol B Aja
I can smell this nigga through the phone 😂
please tell me there is a world tour of JUST this album i must see it live!
Nah, this video is ✨😂
A great song brought to you by Marlboro and Camel:P
Grown & Sexy MUSIC
Their voice are so clear
Bruno Mars ain’t talkin to no moon no more
I've listened to this song at least 100 times since it came out, probably way more. I stopped counting after a while. xD
Hermoso wow
Who this b**** gold digger, thank you for being an inspiration to a great song.
If I had the chance to like this song over and over again I’d do just that!!!!! 🥰❤️❤️
This man never had bad songs❤️🤷‍♀️
They really going back to the 70s and I love it 🥰
1:44 this is scene is funny 🤣
That roll at 1:00 smooth af.
don't date with materialistic women
I don't know... I watched this whole song and it's a miss. We've evolved from men making music about loving women, taking pride in providing to men complaining about having to spend money on a woman and also calling women b*** and other vulgar terms. "This b*** got me paying her rent, paying for trips, in a headlock with her baby daddy, her bad a** kids running around my house like it's Chuck E Cheese" Nah this is disgusting. I guess romantic music wasn't selling for him so he had to jump on the trap music, gangster train. And the fact that everyone is laughing is even more sad. Can't watch this to the end.
I love it when they say “this ..B****!!!” Like that they 😂😂😂
i fuckin hasted uptown funk... this i can not hate... how the fuck do they get it to sound so good! defo getting this album on vinyl
Did..... these fine group of gentlemen just revived RNB?
Bruno is this about Natalie?👀
Me watching this rn Then me coming back to this song 20 min later cuz its too good to stop listening to
How did they continue singing with a straivht face after the fainting part
This is garbage... how could anyone think it a master piece
This is a triple victory for me: Anderson, vocal harmonies, and my enduring love for and defense of brown tones (especially soft ones). Sexcellent.
love the song but hate the bitch line
好好聽啊！
1:45 HE WAS LAYING THERE AND MINUTES LATER MY MAN RESURRECTED FROM THE DEAD WKLAHWLLA
What a classic
"now i gotta give u back to the city" LMFAO🤣💀
Bruno Bruno Bruno Mars 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love it….they did it again!
Everyone that dislikes this listen to mumble rap let’s be serious 😂
The vibes though
So beautiful ❤
Disappointed on Bruno.. he always sang about beauty and happiness and now he’s singing about.. bitches!   Dafaque Bruno 😳😪
Silk sonic! Super Sonic! Now real music is coming home. Smoking Up my windows” Another emotion cruncher. Hummm. Mmmmm! Reminiscent of Motown era.
33.3 Millions subscribers!  Beautiful Numbers 🤩
Love it :)
Marvin Gaye : _This my boy.
They're incredible
I'm just distracted by the thought of the production staff's nightmarish experience of getting out the ashes from the white carpet.
1:48
This was so amazing
Has bruno mars been listening to Kevin Samuels or something? How he went from grenade to this?
70's heaven in the 21❤️
love this duo
Keep doing this kind of moods even if u guys released 30 albums. I’ll be listening over and over again ❤️😊
Now this is music 🔥 Bruno always pulls through with the fire !!!
bunch of simps lol
God, this is very eargasm 🥵
Litro the goat🤝
I guess there's no more hope of reconciling after this song. Yikes.
It's like watching a Motown male group from the 60' 🥰
1:37 he said Bitch with a Capital B  😂
Loveeeee this song i keep on coming back to it and playing it on my Spotify
Sweet music https://youtu.be/AsPKU9BMgLs
I was blasting this song when security came ringing my door  bell like maniacs..." turn it down!" They screamed.🤣🤣🤣
Man went from "Treasury's what you are" to "Go somewhere far". He stopped talking to the moon  🌚 and went to bed y'all 🛌 🤣💀💀💀
There's a bit of Alicia Keys' "You Don't Know My Name" vibe to the tune of this song
love youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
From “Catch a grenade for ya” to “Throw a grenade at ya” 😂
At first I was like nah.... but then i was like Daaaaaaamn.
The look on Andersen P's face says he has experienced sum of this he meant that shit.. I was staying.. I love u guys.
yall crazy
Awesome  song guys 😍😎😎
Revival of the old vibes
this is now one of the best videos of 2021 for me
"THIS JAM IS SMOKING!!! -- WITH A SLIGHT GRIN."
Motown vibes…
If "She belongs to the Streets" was a musical. Classic hit right there.
music to my ears...
Bruno baby....I like what I see AND hear , thank you 😘
We all needed this good feeling 80's vibe , thank you so much 🙌🙌🙌🙌
Anderson .Paak is the best thing that happenned to Bruno Mars ngl, this is Anderson paak sounds but more pop-y all around.
💙💙💙
That damn cigarette bit just sells the whole thing for me haha. The whole song is just smooth
They done picked up a smokin habit and everything..."This bih got me (doin the most) 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and Paak just 💀💀💀😭😭😭

Bruno ain't catching that grenade anymore.
Hi Bruno Mars.  I  like your sunglasses style in this MV as well as your performance.  Can you please tell me your sunglasses information such as  brrand name and style , model number so I can go search it up.  Thanks brother.
My mans Bruno got tired of catching grenades

Legend has it... Anderson Paak is STILL on the floor.
How can you not fall in love with Silk Sonic? The men, those melodic voices add smooth like butter dance moves = the whole dam package!! ❤️‍🔥
Have y'all listened to this at x1.5, x1.75 or x2?🤣 LMAO!
Damn!! You’re back 🙇
"Not to be dramatic" "But i wanna Diee" 1:33
Fucking genius ⚡️⚡️⚡️❤️‍🔥
Listen to Blue Magic, The Stylistics, The Moments. Bruno is just taking it back to old R&B classics that he listened too(probably from mom&dad). I think he's paying homage to that era.
Good Music is not about how much views get in a days or weeks.. this is fireeeeeeee , they done it again 10/10
And he said it with a capital B too🤣🤣🤣
Thanks Anderson Paak and Bruno!! Awesome music!!!
Seeing Bruno met Anderson got me excited more than meeting my soulmate
I loveeeee
I'm loving Bruno's hype man if that's what you call it
Exactly 1% dislike percent 🙄
Just wow, exact my type of Musik. Thank you for bringing it back😍 So cool, that it is so fun also. Love it
I remember commenting years ago on an Anderson .Paak video that I wanted a collab between him and Bruno. AAll I can say is that it is better than I could have ever imagined.
My cousin
My favourite part 2:43
Man who hurt Bruno? Mans can clearly say B**ch in all caps perfectly
Bruno mars made us like we were in 80s 90s vibes...

Reals shit in minutes
They leave the door open  They skate  They smokin'  out the window   An epic trilogy
How many Grammys will this album get?

Greatness!  Listened to the 3 singles the other day and they flowed perfectly within each other.  If the whole album plays like these singles, they got lightning in a bottle and are ready to bless us on Friday!
This generation's version of gold digger 😂
Bruno Mars should win the award for artist of the decade , I'm amazed how someone can be so good at everything they do , I love it , this project is a dream , everything is perfect , and Anderson Paak ,❤️
Это великолепно!

Bruno went from “ imma leave the door open” to changing the lock💀😭
Bruno went from catching grenades to throwing them💀😭
V
la cancion mas dura de  todas
"The Girl is mine" vibes
Do not tell me lightskin OutKast
Dayum. I just listened to Tool's Aenima right before clicking this. What a trip.
AAAAAGHHHHHHH THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST
Anderson Paak is amazing
This guy dosen't catch grenades for girls anymore 😂
Bruno went from "I'll catch a grenade for ya" to "I'll throw a grenade at ya"  Character Development
To all uneducated peeps here, this is inspired from 70’s R&B (Teddy Pendergrass, Spinners, Stylistics, Isley Brothers, etc). This is not new but a modern adaptation.
wtf with the dislikee !!!!!
Haters: They can't create more songs that would hit Bruno Mars: And I took that personally.
This be the breakup song that the guys didnt know they needed
I love this ride that they are taking us on. It’s wild, it’s funny and it’s thrilling. 💥🔥☄️
WE NEEED A FULL ALBUM OF THIS!!!!! DAAAAMN GIRL!
i just love what they doing bringing back real good soul music back the old moves and real instruments playing in the background , this is how is done not the rap shit that destroy the real  music, OYEA DONT FORGET THE DANCING MOVE THEY ARE SO SWEET!!!
1:36 Bruno pronounced that with a capital B
Ok, who tha fk ever hurt Anderson Paak, needs to fkn apologize... lmao
Such a smooth funny song. I think I'll be humming this in my head the next few weeks!
It's funny cuz this will be the new break up song guys play
🤩😍 https://youtu.be/sOltoJl2WMI  this actually helped me today. Idk feels good
I swear this man has not a single bad song
Not the song we wanted, but the song we needed.  And wanted.
O ritmo da música:😎😍😜 A letra:😭😔😢
The vocals of Bruno my god
I hear you in the intro Bootsy Collins.
that B!TCH coming from bruno was def personal lmao 😭
I want to seee you My Permanent idol MR BRUNO MARS⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Future listening to this song like: "damn, they spitting facts"
The most emotional line of the year goes to.... "THIS B*TCH"
This is the best thing that has happened in a while lmfao 🤣😂
SUBARASHIII⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
All man should be treated this way
Bddjdjdjejeheheeh But Anderson just died 😭😭😭😭
🤲
😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
So the season to fall in love with Bruno is again😍😍😍😍 hold up ladiesss❤️
Damnit just drop the damn album and the tour dates so yall can take all my fucking money
Everyone has been releasing trash music except for silk sonic. 🤎✨
What would be brillant would be a Female reply song... Featuring someone like Beyonce from her point of view
the dancing is so in sync i love it
“But she belongs to the streets” would’ve been a hilarious line
Here before a Million likes
i came here because of that damn edit about ninoy 😭 but the song's good
Love song vibe but dissing yo trifling azz!!! lmbo I feel this!!!!
This Bitch……got me playin on repeat😂🤣
i don't like how this video promotes smoking, it's not really that cool
How tall is Bruno Mars? He kinda looks like he’s only 5 feet tall? is he Ariana height?
First this girl had him leaving the door open. Now she got him smoking out the window. smh
Oramai FANNO COPPIA FISSA  QUESTI DUE RAGAZZI STRAORDINARI INTERPRETI NELLO SCENARIO  MONDIALE MUSICALE DI MELODIE SUONI COMPOSTI  SOLO DI SOFTWARE...👍👍 COMPLIMENTI BRUNO SEI FELICE...SI VEDE E C'È LO FAI ASCOLTARE GRAZIE E NON SMETTERE MAI DI CANTARE ...
Rumor has it he felt like doing something today
Very very nice...smooth as silk.
No way they tried to cancel Bruno 😂
So much for this concept heading for a legendary status among Motown greats. Bad move.
Vocals are amazing
Omg epic.  I love everything about this.
the mv is really creative.. oldies music is coming back hell yeah
They bring it back to when it was good!
Using swear words and promoting smoking? They’ve just lost parents and children as their audience. Bad move!
Bruno went from “locked out of heaven” to “pick up ya shit at seven”☠️🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣 I ❤️ it
Bruno and Anderson predicted Travis incident😱😱😱
no more simp Bruno Mars:<
I'm screaming! 😂😂😂
💯💯💯
I am so looking forward to hearing the album on Friday. This song is great.
THIS SONG IS FIRE❤️
Bruno only smokes weed you can tell by the way he holds that ciggy
MA BOI SAID A BAD WORD?!?!?
The fact that Bruno said "bitch" with a capital B and such emphasis 😅😅😅
Props to the band. Is that Bruno’s bro on drum?
So fucking original BESTGROUP OF TODAYS MUSIC . Y’all going down in history man ⭐️
Im in love with this and it is comedy 2021
Yeah I’m convinced Bruno Mars is the greatest artist of this generation
the drama tho
“not to be dramatic…” *proceeds to be dramatic* is now my fav part of music video history 😂💀👏🏾👏🏾
Минздрав предупреждает: курение вредит вашему здоровью ☠️
If this ain't the goofiest/longest way of saying "she belong to the streets"
Should have straight up said she belongs to the streets at that point 😂
"THIS!  BITCH! GOT ME..."  ...gets me hype every time...
What's next making a song about going to 7 eleven grabbing lottery tickets sound soulful cool?
The moment when the homie suddenly pops back into the frame right in time to sing the chorus 😹👌
Anderson Paak, I ain't gonna say he ain't talented cause he really is. But man, I feel like dumb really put breezy lovejoy on. Hope to see him pay homage to dumb one day
"Not to be dramatic but I wanna die" Then fell gracefully like a princess 😂
Yep speaking from experience, all these lyrics are correct 😂😂😂
the best duo..
This song is perfection
Dẫu hiên ngang giữa đất trời Vợ dâm bạn đểu thì đời cũng xong :(
This is best love hate song i have ever heard in my life
At first i thought it was an ads, lmao
I wish i can sang like you..
This is quality music, style, very impressive to be a 2021´s production... more music like this and less reagaetton
I am playing this song like crazy yo😄…this is good stuff, this is real good stuff😅hilarious though but still I LIKE IT.
Does Anderson Paak look a little bit like Dave Chappell to anybody else?
their talent is unmatched they are so cool! and the lyrics...lol. plus the enactments and smoking so much going on
I love this song so much
I'm here because this is what exactly what inside of my tiktok fyp... btw this song is literal bop already my jam.
Real Band ,LOVE IT
all k pop stans to our Idols: THIS B'S GOT ME PAYIN HIS RENT, PAYIN FOR TRIPS, DIAMONDS ON HIS NECK, DIAMONDS ON HIS WRIST AND HERE I AM ALL ALONE :,(

🔥🔥🔥
Bruno is a chick and Lori Lightfoot is a little dewd - welcome to the apocalypse
😁✌️
This it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎤 fellas y’all up one on  🔝 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 love it 💜
Bruno! I want a photo with you! Your music is off the hook & you’re absolutely hilarious!!
Best quote ever “THIS BiTCH GOT ME!”
An absolute MASTERPIECE
My ex stepmother’s shady butt left my Dad  with nothing, broke from a nasty divorce. So the words are so true for some skanky women out there!!
i'm not an english native speaker, can someone explain why they said 'she belong to everybody' instead of belongs? does it have different meaning to it?
He threw the grenade back.
Impresionante. 🌹
Love this like the groups back in the day!!! Awesome!!!
Bruno Baby I’m here for you❤️
The song is so funny but it works another  hit
“not to be dramatic..”  :; lays on the floor dramatically.
wow bruno banget hehe
That would be a perfect lyrics if the she belong to everybody into she belong to the streets 😂
BRUNo MarS!
The remix will have a Future verse in it.
God honestly I have been praying for a miracle to come in my life honestly God 🙏 tonight
Perfect Song
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh my God I ❤ this song play it back to back......Big Ups Silk Sonic......🥰😍😍😍😍 Smoking Out The Window.........
Bruno is on a different league
Listening to this with a big ass smile on my face
This was a need
Y’all realize this kinda looks like treasure ?😶
*Smoking rate rises to 100%*
Some next level $hit right here
This song is 🔥
Mic cords give away the amount of takes but EVERY frame of this is gold!
Hilarious done well.
No bc this music video won 2021 n him lying on the floor makes the musc vid more superior than any music vid i've ever seen
i hope she out here walkin bare foot in these streets
Happily move on
I love the song, but the video 👌
Even the Temptations had 5 Members .Shoot even New Edition .Ill come out of retirement to sing back up for you all  FYI I come from a musical family in the biz currently.  I'm the only singer in the family who has NEVER did a album, only back up, and I'm fine with that.. Screen shot this . because when we meet.. I'm going to say "I sent you a message"
This Jackson five??? I loved it . Bruno Mars IS Amazing.
Bruno went from talking to the moon to talking to his other hoes
NEXT SONG: SHOWER IN THE BATHROOM 😂
Boy I laughed so hard 🤣🤣 I love the music! So well put together 👏🏽 from the musicianship, to graphics, to lyrics, to the comedy, y’all did that ❤️‍🔥
The way they emphasized the fact he’s not smoking out from any window but a Benzo’s window 😭✋🏻
M A S T E R  P I E C E
Instant CLASSIC
The dedication to actually hold those cigarettes the entire take. That’s ol’ skoo funk people. 💯😅 🙏🏽

0:21 ah yes the stance of a man who’s complaining about her bad ass kids running around his whole crib like its chuck e cheese
Bruh 18 million streams in 5 days 😳🤯

Bruno Mars reminds me of el Debarge’s voice!! That high note goes crazy
He really said girl I gotta give you back to the city 😂 & made it sound beautiful asf

My new jam😎 This 🤬 got me smoking
This guy is a music genius 👏

Perfect. I LOVE THIS SONG.

Oh look it’s the red pilled temptations
This is amazing! This is perfectly reminiscent of the soul/funk scene of the 1970s.
I'm done.  My guy died on the bridge and self rezed for the hook.
Bruno really threw the grenade back
Not the badass kids 💀🤣🤣🤣🤣
Echook 🔥
Dude ain’t catching grenades anymore💀

This ain't the first time Bruno had been heartbroken enough to call a woman "bitch" lol See 'Natalie' on Unorthodox Jukebox.
Bruno and Anderson new best duo?
That was amazing!
That man is stressed tf out the way he’s holding that cigarette 😭
I can smell the Afro Sheen coming thru my screen
Why’s is that so smooth. Like don’t ever mess with an artist. They’ll turn your mistakes into gold record.
First of all, I'm waiting for the day we get a full album from these gods!!! Second, looked away grooving to  the music and taking a sip of water and I look back seeing Anderson dead on the floor and I almost choked on my water 😂😂😂😂
Anderson on the floor then popping up sent me 💀💀💀
와 정말 비단같아 노래가 부드러워ㅋㅋ
asombroso como siempre, me gusta esta amalgama de talentos llamada silk sonic
Like seriously…..they didn’t have to body this song like this 🤣💯🔥

1:33 ICONIC
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
i really enjoying their dance choreography than any current K-boyband abstract movements xD
Silky smooth i love it sm maaaan
Classic💯👏🔥🔴
sorry this song is such a downgrade from Leave the door open, lyrics are so cheap not even the concept or the anything else could cure it lol
A lot of simbolos of devil
Very tasty

Not to be dramatic  But I wanna die
Super   Bruno Mars   i like this song
This song so far is what made me feel like how rich people get broken hearted. Damn.
Bruno mars went from, “I hope he buys you flowers” to “I’m glad I’m not paying for that shit”
So smooth!
wowwww this is all just so good! best music coming out in the last few years.
I literally can’t stop playing this song over and over, such a masterpiece.
Future: She belong to the streets! Bruno & Anderson: She belong to everybody, she belong to the city
Oiga amo estoooooooooo
Bruno chill omg 😲
Let me find out Bruno Mars and Paak are red pilled now. Modern women, do better😁
bruno this song remind me when you acted on rio 2 the return scene
BRUNOOOO
They did it again AMAZING 🤩
Daily reminder that Bruno Mars ain't black
18 Million Views For a Well Deserved Song!
bro you killed me!!!
good ad placement for smoking
Waow, quel kiff
This feels like an snl skit with Pete Davidson as the lead. 🤣🤣
This song was conceived for me
This song can  beat k-pop 😀😀
Bruno really threw the grenade back 💀
The dislikes are from the ladies who belong to the streets
Cuánto fumon!!!! Csm!!!!!
This song is so funny and addicting lol! Bruno's note at 3:04 sends chills down my spine! It's sooooooo effing good!
Wow, the chemistry between Bruno and Anderson is just immaculate.
The angst within the way they say, "This Bitch" gave me flashbacks and chills!
nigga tossed back that grenade
I never knew that Bruno Mars could say "This bitch" in a song,  and still making it jamming
bruh i miss the old bruno mars
Who wants to start the remix band I got the studio and Camera n guitar lol..this is a timeless song even though it came out 5 days ago lol
Of their 3 singles released, where would you rank this song?
What yall women did to Bruno??
Bruno one again proving he can do any genre he wants better than anybody else.
https://youtu.be/riLa1mUe3lE
Toxic ass song 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I know y'all was listening to future when y'all wrote this. I love it!!!!🤣
She belongs to everyone 🤣🤣🤣
1:37 Bruno fed up now
That was the shit!!!👌🏾
I`m dead...lol..lol..lol....a hit..
Cocaine makes hella good music
Lit🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bruno's done catching Grenades
Silk Sonic does it again.
Nobody:  Anderson: "OWWWW NOOOOOO!"
Nice
I swear... this song is like"Baby Shark", but for adults.
This song is pure 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I have watched this video so many times.  Love, love, love Bruno Mars but Anderson.Paak brings the comedy first with the way he jumps in front of the camera with “this bitch”, “Hercules, Hercules”, falls to the floor as if he really died and stays there and lastly the way he comes in “hoping her trifling ass is walking barefoot out in the streets”.  Pure comedy!!! 🤣🤣🤣
It's like all the stuff they wanted to sing back in the day, but were censored for radioplay.
bruno needs to release more bc these are bangers
The lyrics, the outfits, the dance sequence and the way Paak is hitting that cigarette 🚬 👩🏿‍🍳💋
So perfectly classy yet funny- I love this song 😂❤️
Silky smooth groove baby~l
Future needs a verse on this😂😂
Future needs a verse on this😂😂
This is a classic way of telling her she belongs to the streets🥺😂😂
ese bruno mars es mas votado que agua sucia, soberbio que trata mal hasta a sus empleados, es un acomplejado, espero que cambie y sea mas humilde.
Silk Sonic is single-handedly keeping music alive
Not that he died on stage for Bruno's epic part😂😂
Love it 😍 I love the vocal work and specially the sense of humor 😂
This was a very awesome, and funny music video! I was laughing at him on the floor dead, then he popped up!
This is basically a melodic version of Kanye's Gold Digger
Bruno went from “you can count on me like 123” ,  to hell nah you can’t see me !
It’s Anderson falling out and then jumping back up like nothing 😭
Kept me smiling from start to finish 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Baby mama ring tone for sure
These two together should have been giving us hit after hit. They make a dream team ❤️
1:37
Bringing back that early 70's r&b - The Delfonics, The Chi Lites, Blue Magic, The Originals, Billy Paul and so many more great artists
Still have hope about this new generation Musics. Thanks Bruno & Anderson
"Gotta give you back to the streeEEEAAT
I need a counter from city girls to make a collaborative story
dugaya ma 100M views oy charizzz hahaha
Bruno still aint lost his touch
Berta Daily Top 10 11-10-2021 Top 9 Yesterday:10 Peak:9 Days:3
Bruno got tired of them damn grenades
only thing he missed out on was in fasetto singing, She belongs to the streets! and end it with a bang
My son turned me on to Bruno Mars a few yrs ago, this music always reminds me of him:)!!
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!    OOOOOOHHHHHHHH!
Mr. Mars, as a concerned fan, I speak for everyone when I ask, "who hurt you, man?"
Bitch had Anderson so fucked up😤😤
the ultimate sugar daddy track! 😂
This is masterpiece
I've watched this way too many times and yet I haven't seen enough of it
Props to the cigarettes.
When are men gonna stop calling women b**** bc that's outdated...
I laughed the entire song ✋🏾😭😂
there can only be one bruno
1:36 is what you’re looking for
THESE GORGEOUS MOTHER FUCKERS ARE THE BOMB❣️❣️🙏❣️🙏🙏
Bruno mars did it again!!!!
This is my favorite single of SilkSonic to date.
Anderson really popped back up like Jesus on day 3😭
THAT HERCULES CLAP-STOMP 🤣😎
When the sugar daddy not getting the memo
Good music NEVER dies!
Bruno Mars in 2017 during thats what I like: I WILL GIVE YOI SO MUCH MONEY AND BUY YOU SO MUCH SHIT.  Bruno Mars 2021 during this song: I cant believe she took all my money
The shade of it all!  But I like it.
I did not know that I needed it in my life 🖤
He threw ain’t shit from doja right back in her face
Ugh! I shouldn't like it but I do!
Like everything going up in prices these days, watch out, Kool and Newports gonna be expensive after this song. Also Marboros and Camels too.
This song really get my attention
They're so smooth gotta love them 😍 💕
Oh man this was so good, so smooth and unexpectedly funny. Fantastic!
Anderson falling out killed me 😂
Love you guys ❤❤
Bruno mars be smoking out the window blowing that “crack” smoke
This is like a take on Chappelle's Show where Dave goes to a club that ?uestlove was djing. Then ?uest played a 2Pac song that narrated the current affair like he was still alive. This has that tone of a sketch musical from the variety show days. I can dig it.
SOU BRASILEIRO E DEPOIS QUE O MICHAEL JACKSON MORREU, MINHA VONTADE É IR NUM SHOW DO BRUNO MARS🇧🇷
🙄😳Fk what you think! They did dat.......😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Love the old school vibe
Bruno mars songs should have dance version!
If Anderson Paak ad-Lib the lying on the floor part, he’s a genius. 😂
Can't for album 😭😭😭😻😻🔥🔥🔥🔥
When Bruno Sings, its like Robin from Teen Titans Singing.
1:44 you're welcome 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"babe, you want me to order you something?" "no its fine, im not hungry" *reaches over to grab a piece of my food* 0:32
Thank you guys for making this kind of music!! Brasil loves you!!
How is it possible to LOVE everything they do???
The sigs holding when saying this bitch...is fucking Gold🤣🤣🤣
"This bitch ...."  I felt that :(
<3
lol.. this is hilarious but a little bit sexist. LOL.. I feel like it needs to have a female singer preferably Lizzo sing a sequel to this song.     One of the lyrics can be, "I ain't belong to anyone but myself"
AAAYYYOOOOOO.....WHY HE STILL ON THE DAGGONE FLOOR🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Those two cats are keeping R&B alive by themselves.
Is this why R-Kelly had to go to jail so they could steal his style?! ijs
Very good song the man died
That was tight!
Bruno and Anderson is a dynamic duo
I hope this doesn't get CENSORED or CANCELLED with the smoking reference and wonderful props lol. Wonderful !
It’s not just the killer song that makes this so great, it’s the look of the video. From the yellow-brown tones, to the lightbulb covered stars and the chocolate velvet tuxes, not to mention them old school hand-held mics, it looks like a perfect Soul Train retro moment.
he went from watchu doin where you at to I hope yo ass don’t come back😂
Do you know Moss Bruno Mars from I’m going to leave the door open To take your sh*t and leave
buno mars now ain't lazy no more and decided to closed the door
🤣😅😅 fucking great
Who pissed Bruno off?  Someone check on Anderson 😂
Loving the old school vibes it’s giving 💜
blz
Genre 1000% good
Now I have something to jam for the next few weeks
Deym good American music, if i ever heard one in years. Smooth. Crisp
Hummmm Maybach Music 🎶 👱🏽‍♀️
It is not so usual seeing people smoking cigarettes these days. It has been looked strange to me.
LOL
Are they gonna keep making bangers that I’ll have on repeat forever🧍🏻‍♀️
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Smoking is bad for your lungs, kids.
Nossa, eles estão muito bem arrumados
See you guys in 10 years when we come back to this video to remember this classic
Mars and his brothers have NEVER stopped putting the work into their craft. Their love and enthusiasm keep it fresh for them and us. Thank You.
My opinion and I stand unanimous in this! He’s making R&B a joke. No one has ever sang some BS as such, he’s a gimmick now. 👎🏽
Is it just me or does it sound like Dave Chappelle wrote these lyrics?
1:43 Ninoy Aquino moments
My new "smokin' after work," tune for a few weeks. 😳😳😤😏
Shit was so clean bruh fr
*This came from #18 TRENDING when I first seen it to #1 TRENDING! I love it and very proud of these guys!*
Wait a minute! If she belongs to everybody, when's my turn?
🔥🔥🔥🔥 I need album with those type of songs
1:37
They are smooth af 🥰
this is something that bruno mars would make if he was the host of snl
Bruno ready to throw the grenade towards her
🤘❤
So fuckin relate to me🤣
The music 💖✨🔥🌬🌸 The lyrics 🤡🚗🚕🚦🚧 🦶🛣
Te amo 💞💞😍😍 Bruno Mars tienes una voz de 1000 y más allá , lo que puedes dar en cada canción es lo más de la máximo exelente cantante y todo tu equipo que tienes nunca se te ocurra separarte de ellos💗💗💗💗💗🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
PERFECTION
When Anderson stuck his face in front of the camera and started his part I was on the floor! 🤣
I cant wait to have a car so i can play this while in a long ride while vibing
Ministerio da saúde adverte hahaha...  love that!! you kill it guys <3
Me encanta la tematica de los 80, muy original.
He's so skinny, he literally looks like he's been smokin his own shit.. He looks all sucked up !!!!
Damn they never miss

This is explaining how females are nowadays so pay attention 💯💯💯

You assholes are cheeky and I love it! BTW! I miss Chunky Hernandez! Feed him please!🥰
1:44 it's kinda remembering me of someone 🤣😅 🎗️
Silk Sonic don’t miss!
Amazing😍😍
when bruno said "gotta give you back to the city" i felt that 😊
Crazy about silk sonic 😘😘 I love it
Bruno threw the grenade back
The whole 70s vibe! The stage is 70s motif, their outfits, even their dance steps. BRILLANT! and Smooth ASF! These guys can do no wrong ❤
He’s going to keep the door closed from now on
1:44 greatest moment for Anderson .Paak
Fire
Bruno Mars has a mixed signals

Kings
Me encanta!!!
Shout out to the Choreographer!!
How is it possible that I have been holding out on this song for such a long time 🤦‍♀️
Epic. If you know what kinda glasses Anderson Paak is rockin leave a comment
1:44 1983 vibes💀
Lol the way Anderson Paak pops up saying “This bitch! Got me!”😂🤣🙌🏾
Beautiful!
This hit me like when New Edition dropped "This Ones For You and Me"...I guess this is the after story. The Aftermath🤣
I was hoping the day will come that bruno mars will write song that i could sing 😞
Where was this song last year i really needed it lol
BRUNO HAS TO BE IN THE SUPERBOWL AGAIN!!! 😃
Man, they did it again... 😳😱😎
Bruno and Anderson are constantly producing BANGERS
I wouldn’t be surprised is Bruno actually came from Mars basing off how consistently talented he is
Vibes nice but melody too complicated and messy. Make it simple, bruno
This really hit home I enjoy this so much
I haven’t heard a better music duo in my life hahaha I love it
I wonder who “ This Bitch “ is
I'm not sure how this can be so smooth, yet comedic at the same time, but it is. Lol #lyricsmatter
Mans Went from:   "I'm a leave the door open ~" too:   "I'm changing the Dang locks!"
Talk about sponsorships.
Simplesmente Incrível.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

1:35 THIS NIKKA ON THE FLOOR DEAD 😅
But I wanna Die… EPIC….
He really went from leave the door opened to locking the door…
🔥🔥🔥
Holy smokes. We need to know the ✨chisme✨
INSTANT 👏 CLASSIC 👏
Bruno Mars went from "just the way you are" to "f*ck the way you are"
Everything about this song and video is perfect, except I kinda would've liked it if Anderson .Paak just laid there for the rest of the video
Extraordinary. No words for this... 👏🏻❤️🌹. Masterpiece!
I feel like we all needed this.
God damn it QUIT MAKING SMOKING LOOK COOLER THAN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PILLOW
I am 62 and when saw the picture of the video I couldn’t wait to hear the beautiful voices of silk sonic and the smooth dance moves but when I heard the song for the first time I laughed so hard I scared my cats! Someone got played very well indeed!!! Ready for some sweet love songs now guys.

Bruno Mars holds true to his nature and dropping hits several years later.  See ya'll in 3-5 years again.

I'm a big fan of bruno Mars since he started . I love his voice and moves. His band Are also Killin it .
Masterpiece🔥
She belongs to the streets 😆 🤣
I love everything about this video - from the dramatic overlay, the comedy, the simple but swaggy choreo, the pop culture references, and ofc the overdramatic "death" and sudden pop back up! This had me dying with laughter but also groovin' so hard!! Team Bruno killing it as usual <3
Anderson Paak is so theatrical ....I wanna die (falls to the floor) lol
This is special, best music put out in YEARS !!!!
If this bi@$% got you smoking out the window AFTER you paid the the rent; then you need to be smoking in the window, down the hall, in the kitchen and anywhere in the house . Come on dude you know better than that!😂🤣🤙
They out here singing about Hoes in the MOST elegant way! Lmao.
Lindo
He went from imma leave the door open to changing my damn locks.

Not trying to be rude but Anderson Paak was the best part of this music video
OMGGGGGGGGG I LOVE YOU ALL!!!!!

CHESMISTRY ☄️🕺🏾
Over 18mil views in 5 days, i know I've watched this multiple times, They are legend's - i wonder how quick till they reach 1B?!
The best..
😆 😆 😆. 💘 it.
THEY SAID SHE FOR THE STREETSSSSSS
That pop up took me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Its only been fucking 5 days and I've listen to this song too many times
on unorthodox jukebox bruno’s song “natalie” follows a similar plotline but in a more serious fashion and its one of the best songs on the album. this feels more complete and im living for it
This is an INSTANT CLASSIC!!
heels off, bruno.
Help. I can't stop playing it.
Ai meu Deus viu! 😂😂🥰
😍😍
Tiktok about to ruin this song
Show! 😅
"...Bad *ss kids runnin' round my whole crib... like it's Chucky Cheez..."  😂  I'm dead!... 👏🏽  This video... and lyrics... are FANTASTIC! 😆
"not to be dramatic but i want to die" is the most relatable lyric
11/10
R&B is backkkkkkk. Ready for 2022. Are you Readyyyyy?
I'm convinced Bruno has a secret hit-song formula and is just running lyrics through that mug because every song is a banger
I’m digging it, how long till the Karen’s out there bitch about the smoking!
I hope Silk Sonic wins like 20 Grammys …. This is literal silk for my ears ❤️
Anderson .Paak keeps getting love and it's deserved.  Dude is hella talented.
Did anyone mentioned Bootsy silky voice opening this piece of  awesomeness ?  And the fact that  Bruno managed  to rhyme Tiffany's with Chuck'n'Cheese?!  Now, " Hercules Hercules Hercules "  got me totally off guard  LMAO    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR1UiNdQnDw
Going back to the early 80's, I love it, I'm a big fan of Bruno Mars and co.
"This bitch got me paying her rent" 💀
Brought to you by the Kevin Samuels Facebook group!
Being her own sugar mama is the best thing she could do damn lol
Such talent! Too bad it's a product and not art.
From "Imma leave the door open" To "finna change the locks"
Who did Bruno mars like this🤧😂😂😂😂

And now yer in disbelief, #SmokingOutTheWindow singing 'how could she do this to me'.. please do not bring me back to the city!!! to #Anderson.Paak, and #SilkSonic I thought you liked me but ye teamed up with my man.! this Love-Hate relationship is making us all go crazy
Intro: let me take it back but with a new flavor… let’s go!

Bruno really said his simpin-and-spoilin days are OVER 😂
Why use the word, "Bitch?" Very disappointed in Silk Sonic. Could have said "girl" or used another word.
I dunno but... I prefer this to Kpoop. Call me crazy.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
God dammn itt.. How could u guys be soo effing talented??
EPIC 🔥🔥🔥
Lyrics: Wait a minute, this love started out so tender and so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  [Verse 1: Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, & Both] Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah, woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  [Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars] This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak] Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  [Verse 2: Anderson .Paak] Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me, please (Help me, please, help me, please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  [Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars] This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak] Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could you do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (One things fasho, one things fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong to) Yeah, she belong to everybody That girl there, she belong to everybody  [Interlude: Anderson .Paak] (Oh, no) Look here, baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But, I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round bare foot in these streets Look out  [Bridge: Bruno Mars] Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now, I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  [Chorus: Bruno Mars] Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong) Yeah, she belong to everybody She belong to everybody Ooh
When this shyt gets old it’s going to look hella old
This is the truest cut ever 😆 🤣
Ima be blasting this song all the way until I'm in my 40s hosting bbq with my grandkids and shit
Anjing

Why Bruno looks like he’s in drugs? 🥴
The fact that Real Truth Telling Story line Music is Back. I Praise. It Hurts, I know....
How was this supposed to be hilarious
Wow love the old school vibe
Bruno was born in the wrong generation..  .......or an old soul
1:20 best part of the video.
Absolute legend 🥺😍😍😍😍
I Feel the 90s musics in this ganre of the song
Yeah the videos are funny BUT we all have to admit the music and the vocals are GOLDEN! I love this genre that they are trying to bring back. The feel is so smoooooooooooooooooth! :)
Poor Paak.  He went into an epileptic convulsion from the pain of being played and none of those MoFus called an ambulance for Paak.  I'm guessing no one called 911 because the last time someone called 911 for Pac nothing was solved.
😐 this B... Ch is so 😭 uhhhh      nice dance voice 🕺👋🕺🕺🕺 bogies, guys 🌎
Ahh yeaa this a vibeeee🔥🔥🔥❗️❗️❗️
Bruno can get it
Shots fired to the city girls 😂😂😭😭
Someone hurt him that was a capital B
2021 gold digger
Se la comieron coño
Here I was thinking a lot of modern music sucks then Bruno comes out with this omg
Bruno used a capital B 🤣
It's very nostalgic!
These are true artists at work. There is hope for the music industry when stuff like this is created.
Please do a collaboration with mamamoo next please you guys will be good together singer

I just love Bruno lol his songs always make me want to put on repeat and make me happy
This is such a bop but also big mood. I rem when he came out and my parents, who are metal heads, went out and bought his album. They adore him. And all his music truely shows his range
This shit is so good

Oh shit!!  Another dope song from Silk Sonik, yo!!!!  FUCK YEAH!!!

When Anderson said this bitch got me paying rent🤣🤣🤣🤣I burst out laughing this is a masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Normally I don't like new music, but DAAAAMN! This has it.
The anti single mother anthem
They are saying “BITCH” with such emotion and intensity!!🤣🤣🤣

Classic.
too much old school
I just love this group ❤
“Don’t want to be dramatic” then proceeds to be dramatic 😂
This couldn't be any better!!! Love it!
Hahahh, the smoothest offensive song "cuz she belongs to everbody, everbody" old style and still with groove.. geniuses
These guys can’t miss I’m so happy they got together they’re a perfect group I actually don’t want them to stop this
This the Alimony Anthem
Just give them all the awards for this now. Absolutely brilliant.
Bruno mars y Christina Aguilera lo mejor que retorno este año 👑👑
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They went from leaving the door open to smoking out the window 😂
disappointed! I was expecting to see Marlboro Man
The horrible and extremely repetitive drum fills won't put this song into disgrace! Awesome song ♥!
Love them
Anderson and Bruno are giving me the late great Rudy Ray Moore Dolemite vibes but r&b/funk/soul/everything 😭❤️😏😜
Lmaoooooo
Best shit dropped so far in 2021
That's like an 80's song
Everything about this is clean asl
DIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS QUE TEMON
Waab song dramatic asf😭
Kkkkk vcs são foda DEMAIS.  Muito bom Brazil aqui
Hey, let's glamorise a dying habit ! Ker-ching .....  Seriously, all the confected outrage about heavy metal over the years and no-one raises an eyebrow when it comes to this kind of product placement. Big tobacco must be doing cartwheels. I dont give a damn about political correctness but anyone who grew up in the 60s and 70s know exactly how UN-sexy it was to be surrounded by addicts - its time we put smoking in the rearview mirror.
When your to young to know how things be out here : “I would catch a grenade for ya!”  When ya get older: “This bitch got me…”
Ok but the throwback vibez is everything
Boys got swagger
Bruno is showing the world that the world needs soul and love in there lives. frfr👍
🔥 🔥 🔥 I thought this was a New Edition joint 😂
Pasan los años y Bruno Nunca pierde el estilo al cantar. Unico 👌🏻
just take all that grammys my men.
😂 HAHA! Bravo 👏🏽🥳! MARVELOUS 🎉!
Needs a 12” disco extension
no bc im addicted
he scared me 1:51 ☠
No words. Just excellent.
this nigga came out of no where 0:31 💀
What a nice smooth way of saying, "this bitch got me fucked up"
Neve been more hyped for an album. So far 3 10/10s have been released
I’m obsessed
They giving me modern Commodores vibe.
Anderson  Pak format is too cold.
Ahhhh yes
#louwiv
#raydarmuzicgold
#gyaliscompetition
AMAZING 😍
I guess hell hath no fury like a brother man scorned………..
This is what I call greatness!!!! Repeat is a must!
Absolutely perfect and soothing
@1:16 is by far my favorite part of this song. Sooooo goddamn smoothhhhh
It’s Bruno Mars for me this b 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Rescatando o som da montawn
I think Bruno Mars still lives in the 80s,90s 😍😂 love that he is still doing these songs❤
Hmmm, a Saxx copy
completely sucks....
I love this 💯❤️❤️😂
Such smooth dance moves Bruno!
La wuea pulentaaaaaaa
RIP to .PaaK @ 1:42. 😕  "Welcome Back!" a few seconds later. 😆🍻
the way AP died and resurrected had me ctfu.
Quel talent
Love it. Look and sound like 80's You are the best Bruno
if i were to put this song into a genre what would i put it in? i wanna find more music like this
Over the moon sassy and smooth as satin on a suede suit
This music video reminds me of The Manhattan's Shining Star.
THIS SONG IS A LITERALL DRUG I CANT STOP PLAYING IT
This is amazing lmao
This song is straight 🔥  got me angry at my ex now 🤣
Bruno holding over when he said like it's Chucky Cheese has me cracking up 🤣🤣
why is he on the floor?????! 😭
She belongs to the streets 😩
Just the other night she was gripping on me tight screaming herculessss🔥🔥🔥
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗😘👍🏽😊😊
bruno really said that bitch can go 😂
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Omfg this is pure orgasm!
silk sonic's songs will be classics
Don't care for this song.
VC é demais Bruno!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤
Dope
Sempre arrasando!...Não tem uma única música que eu não gosto do Bruno, simplesmente ame todas❤❤❤😌👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Waiting for y'all to officially come out as a band😅😅
She for da streetz!
I DIG THIS ❤
This song is so awesome!  Brings me to the sound and harmonies that I enjoyed listening to while growing up. Maybe this will inspire other artists to go back to the 'Old School,' vibe.  This is my favorite video that I have watched in a very, very long time (maybe ever).  Bruno seems, to me, to be channeling David Ruffin.   I would like to know though if the reference to Hercules, and the repeat, is a little homage to "Nutty Professor," family table scene.
Funny. Smokin out the window.
HOLY FUCK
Maravilloso 😍
Bruh if he woulda said “to the StreHeeets” it woulda been so fye
Shout out to the "this bitch"(es) who inspired this song🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Me with my gf in the mall And she wants everything and go to hotel (I said)...   Me*This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips*
This! Bitch! Got me paying the rent!
Video is trash song is alright but sounds so similar their other songs
Omg😂😂😂
I really think they shoulda said "beyotch" instead to avoid the censors.
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
Had track ay3ich tal 2030
Smoooooth, loved it! Took me back to the days of the Temptations with those smooth moves, perfectly in sync with each other, the harmonies and those David Ruffin specs. It's lyrics just made it even funnier.
les français??
I like it
im in love
For me these guys are the confirmation that there is still hope for music 🎶❤️🎶❤️
💎 _classy_ 💎
Lol
Toooooo much , he can do better than this 💩... always same melody  is boring
BRUNO is a GOLDEN STAR🌟
Wow!! This was an awesome tune 🎼🎶🎵🎙️! When I finally listened 2 the lyrics.... OMG!! A 🔥 mess 🤦. A catchy tune about their girl cheatin on them. SMH (WHO would cheat on Bruno Mars & Anderson. Paak?!!)  Yo!!.... That high note that Bruno did at the end.... WHOOOOOO!!! N as always I luv,luv,luv,LUUUUVVVV his falsetto!!!!
Don't know why I'm laughing 😂
❤️❤️❤️❤️
He closed the door.
What A thrill ! Congratualations Bruno ;  we're adore You honey ; I were hope With eagerly a New successes yours ! 😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩 . Thanksssss 💛✨
Can't wait to see them in concert!
Always sounds the same. Same exact beat and everything.
smoking out the hiro
Bruno really threw the grenade back 💀
Shiiiiiiz, Cheese 🔥🎙️🎶
Bruno is literally a modern Michael Jackson it might sound crazy but think of all the hits he’s had since 2011.. Dude is a legend salute 👑
The next single is called “I’m about to go O.J.”
This brings back memories of treasure 😭 I love Bruno so much
I think he made this for will and Jada 😂😂😂
When paak died shit had me rolling 💀💀💀💀
😂😂😂😂😂😂Anderson play that dramatic drop to a key😈🤙🏾
Sofrência nível hard. Credo!! Sertanejos façam uma versão pfv👏👏👏
I thought Bruno was Michael Jackson for a second
LMAOOOOOO Anderson laying on the floor is killing me
1:44 😆😆😆
Most of you mfs bumpin to this aint paying for shit 😂😂
Crazy❤️🙈
It was so tastefully executed, the comedy doesn't even take away from the music at all. Bruno and Anderson's coming together is definitely something the cosmos is responsible for. It's almost TOO right and too good.
Am I the only one who gets David Ruffin vibes from Anderson Paak? 😂😂
This is so funny 🤣🤣🤣 love it tho❤️
Someone got Bruno fucked up
This is the "She Belongs to the Streets" anthem...Future on the remix?
Oh they don’t miss
Once upon a time about 2010, I heard a guy singing about wanting to be a billionere while I was sending an email. I spun around and knew in one intant that I was looking at the next big star of the future!  He will never be the second MJ. He will forever be the first and only Bruno Mars!  Love you,  my guy!
Fucking hilarious this is my new jam. I think this is my new ringtone also
Thanks for making smoking cool again.
Just too good! Love it!
Adoro este hombre porque siento que me transporto ala época en la que quize haber nacido y lo disfruto tanto! Amo 😍
This sounds so good! Shame on that girl for making them sing about her misbehaving!
The fact he was on the floor for like a whole ass chorus is dedication.
They are definitely bringing back that "Motown Sound".
Gotta love me a deep reference to the Norbit Hercules part 😂
#anotherhit huh🌈👍✌👑
It's really much better with Anderson tho
Pure Masterpiece 🌠
this is legendary 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
OMG,  I, at first, was turned off by them calling her a bitch.  The song is silly, the video is really silly.  It won't have the same impact as Leave the door open or even Skate but it helps those people who have been used.
Bruninho não tem uma música ruim não é possível sempre se supera
Omg omg omg it’s amazing again!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I got this on repeat the last 4 days. Smooth as butter
They did they shit right here 😌 Marvin Gaye woulda been so proud of this
Did anybody else notice the nutty professor reference? 🤣🤣🤣
This cant be the same Bruno that would catch a grenade for you. 😭
I saw this on the Genius IG page and I am dying of laughter and IN LOVE!!!! They don’t miss man! 😂😂😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥😘
My boy switched sides 💀
that shit is HILARIOUS!!! his on the ground was good, but him popping back up... genius.  you guys have absoLUTLY nailed it w this group! the aesthetic, the playful lyrics, all of it, incredible. you know that though, I'm certain of it. good job keep the real life slow jams coming
Down for the count, then back up again!! 😆 LOL
Too much smoking
this is the most fun I've had with a music clip ever!
I literally love everything about this
This is great!
I love that he always goes back to the old style of music with a bit of new school🔥🔥❤️
Smooth like a Good brandy i
An awesome duo!!!!!!
Old Skool blasphemy
We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                                Romans 10:9
Is this my new favorite music video?
YOW B*TCHES
1:43 and a meme was born!
I really don’t like Bruno but I can bops to this
Classic!
love AAAAA.
😻😻😻😻😻👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The best duo ever! Their song always bring something new everytime!
I love the old school Flava but why such vulgar lyrics, a woman should never be classified as a B. I love Bruno and Anderson bringing back the old school flava but one thing their missing in this one, is that old school music was  love songs, they didn't degrade women, even if the woman wasn"t a good person. Atleast, I don't recall it! I loved Imma leave the door open, stay in that vein, guys. You'll are classic!.
Fantastic stuff. And a tune to boot!
Not Chuck E. Cheese 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🇧🇷
Aye no disrespect but when Anderson came in and said "This Bitch" I was dying .
So far there are 7.8k people triggered by this song. 🤣🙄🤦‍♀️
Bruno was gone because he was paying for trips
OMG! This is Amazing 🔥💖💖
On my 15th replay and each time hits more passionately than the last
Bruh!! 🤣#EPIC
Product placement in lyrics. Awesome.
Bruno Mars… The greatest of this generation… there I said it…
O wow great video for kids.. 😑😑😑
These two FELT these lyrics…what chick did them wrong?😂
Cold world...
Male version of summer walker song!😄😄😄😄😄😄
they never seem to fail at bringing that nostalgic vibe. this was needed! 💚
Sucesso b
Bruno Mars nunca comete erros, Deus abençoe essa voz e esse talento, quero ter a oportunidade de ir num show dele. Bruno não vem p Brasil ainda, pelo amor de Lilith, espera eu ter dinheiro pufavô 👍😢
gdammit! 3 for 3 silk sonic! my dudes want all the grammys
If this ain't a whole mood... I don't know what is.
This song going into Saturday morning house cleaning collection
I swear this song could be dedicated to PJ Washington.
Who else noticed that anderson ashed the cigarette on beat at the "this bitch got me" part.
Vintage, maravilhoso
Black bin bags
I'm dead 😂
So happy I stumbled across this HOL 😝 It resonates in ways you wouldn’t believe.
Temazoooo
I think we using this against summer walker
If it can happen for them it can happen for me
The 7.8k dislikes are the bitches who get their rent and trips paid with diamonds on their neck and wrist
Os melhores  👑👑
when the lyrics kinda fit. goddamnit
Bro when are they gonna drop that album?? or are they release everything as a single???😭😭 im tired of waiting
Trumskinn

Relationship stress stg🚬
More please ! Some old school
Maybe I'm just high but this sound it's pretty good ☀️
Me realizing they can perform this song as an SNL skit as is
I can already see the “She for the City” memes
1:33 😭😭
Who can not like this ... lmbo     This is a Float On Memory .
I’m just happy Epandagram is back!!!!! 😮‍💨
Anderson! Come on now man, you told her you was leaving the door open and if you feel like I feel that you want to make love tonight she came through and rocked yo world!!! So quit that and get up off that floor 😉 man up! Lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The way Paak comes into the shot at 0:31
Absolutely riveting.. couldn't take my eyes off the show 😃😎👀👀👀brilliant vocals
Another hit song
This song's funny as fuck but speaks volumes on how the people you trust the most could one day turn against you and leave you half-alive. I could confirm!
the people that disliked are the bitches that made Bruno and Anderson pay the rent and trips. 😂
https://youtube.com/channel/UCw1gdOisUqQfI-CcD3JQiAA
It must smell awful in there
O puro deboche
Porra aí sim estão resgatando a música anos 70 80 mandou bem
Que talento. ❤️
Duck Sauce
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best video I have seen for a long long time!
Pov: they're singing to Natalie
THIS.. BITCH!! 😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
Boy if this doesn’t hit home for me and so many other guys
Fire but it would have been better I'd they said "the streets" instead of "everybody" it would have been funny and rhymed with "only me" I'm the first line
Great sound great moves just don’t like the cigarets, but another fab song from the amazing Bruno Mars
Mas não adianta , tudo que esse homi faz é pedrada , não erra nuncaaaa
Aí vc tá curtindo a música , sentindo uma paz, vai olhar a tradução 😂😂😂
Paak better by himself. Mars dont add value to paak, mars just dilutes the soul that paak brings. Paak, he add everything that mars is missing.
I wish I was everybody
You can hear the direction of this album and I love it.
Bruno mars: imma leave the door open Also bruno: imma change  all the locks
Them ciggs tho 🚬  Lmao original asf 😂

When Anderson reappeared after he died. LMAO!!!!
the aftermath of hot girl summer as a song
this song is like the perfect lyrics for hard core fans lol
🔥🔥🔥⭐️⭐️⭐️
This is hilarious 😂
Yung nakangiti lang ako buong song ☺️☺️☺️
Okay but Snoop Dogg needs to be on this¿
Like the temptations and commodores etc in their  style, a great era of music then.
THIS BOTCH GOT ME.....
Einfach nur geil!
Bruno Mars & Anderson Paak out hurr making good sultry classics for 2021 ❄💥❄
😂😂 Paak cracks me up with the facial expressions
Michael Jackson and then Bruno Mars !!
Girls hate this trick
Imagine how beautiful current day music would be if this much creativity and passion was put into each and every song. Another classic my fellow mixed baby. The collaborations you have with these brothers is amazing. I felt like I was watching a Jackson 5 video.  💚🧡🖤
Nahhh, y’all different for this! lmaoooo
AMO. A M O
Smoking is bad. Song is good. Ying and Yang Motherfugger
This shit is to epic

Bruno sounding Bobby brown a little.
God bruno Mars doing R&B is one of the best things ever, man's done catching grenades

This Right here should be sanji's theme song.
My only take away from this honestly - THIS . BITCH. LOL

Moment of silence for everyone that doesn’t have that special someone to sing this to😂😂😂😂
Fabulous!!! Old school and F.U.! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Genius
TB4L

brooooooo silk sonic is too dank
Bruno, Paak stop! you're about to start a post covid lockdown baby boom. this is too smooth. people will be hooking up because of these tunes!
She belong to the streets 🤣😂🙈🤣
The drama of the pass out scene is the perfect final touch!  #chefskiss
Yep this officially the anthem for throwing out town bicycles to the streets.
She's for the streets anthem
Curly cables on the bass and guitar..classic.
Uffff amazing, the best videoclip & sound of this year, thnx Bruno
bruno mars = red pilled
Best song of 2021
I don’t know what all the fuss is about. All of you are smokin’ something…it ain’t that good.
This song is like a pandemic in Egypt right now .. it's very awesome ❤️
Qué genialidad!!!!!👏👏👏👏❤❤❤
😂😂🤣🤣🤣 I was not expecting this. Omg this is 🤣🤣
The song is both amazing and hilarious. I've fallen in love with it and cannot stop listening to it. I'm addicted. I would be so awesome if ATEEZ did a cover of this
You left the door open now you smoking out the window!! What’s next?? 🤔🤔

bruno eu não tava pronta AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
SONICALLY AMAZING
This is epic as hell
Let's give our props to the other band members as well! They kill it
When did Bruno Mars become a Vegas act. I think he has forgot who he is. 😞
Bruno went from, "I'll catch a grenade for ya," to "I'll throw a grenade at ya."
I like the song video 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 The is so cool video 😎👍
😂🤣😂🤣 I low key like it
I didnt even know I needed this...
I'll never forget when I came late to a Bruno concert and missed Anderson's performance, and now they're silk sonic HSFDJKFKJSHGKDj I MISSED MY CHANCE
Bruno is looking really thin
This is the funniest shit I’ve seen in so long
Oh, the singers are saying, “it’s all about me”.
Seems like Natalie finessed his ass again 💀
They found a way to be rude and funny and also mixed the old with  new school I love it this going to make history 🎶
Fantastic....
Oh mi fucking god 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Just like the music of the 70’s! Love it!
To the 7.7k people that don't like this, what is your life like?🤔🤔
Omggggg thiss 😊😊😊😊
Bringing real music back like...DIS BITCH GOT ME!
Wow...My Niggaz this song is hard  as fuck !!!!! The video is too im smoking a fat ass blunt because thats Life!! Lol
Muito bom !!
Not sure if Anderson realizes every time they perform this live, the audience will expect him to drop to the floor. LOVE THAT LOL!😆
Isso sim que era música. Show, maravilhosos 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They really know where music tickles
((SWOONING!))😍😍🥰🥰
I mean Anderson killed his part too but let’s be real if Bruno is in it it’s usually a banger 🔥🔥🔥
Omg, i love you bruno, and your moves, you're a legend, Anderson paak looks grate
Damn. A hit every time
This guy makes music when he gets the urge, not when he has to
Y’all should of been drop this album
The woman that he pay the rent is Doja Cat? 😂
are we going back to calling people a jive turkey?
Good vibe✌🏼🙅🏽‍♂️
This brings me back to the seventies ( yeah i'm old lol) but this is even better, just love this.
That girl belonged to the streets 🤣🤣🤣
Love bruno mars bringing back classic sounds. 👌💯💝
:33 he ashed his cigarette on the snare hit. so goddamn smooth
I fell out when Anderson Paak did.🤣
RELEASE THE DAMN ALBUM ALREADY 🥺😥😭
Bruno is throwing back the grenades and no longer leaving the doors open.
Felt that when Bruno looked into the camera and said "got her bad ass kids runnin' round my crib like it's Chucky Cheese" ..and both Bruno and Anderson hitttin' that "this bih got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips, diamonds on her neck...diamonds on her wrist...and I'm all alone" ...tell them chicks mane...like Anderson said, "I hope you're triflin' ass is barefoot in these streets" 😂😂 Smh some women are triflin' 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️😂😂😂😂
LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO IGNORE OUR LOVED ONES... LET'S KEEP STRIVING FOR THE BEST FOR ALL OUR PRECIOUS ONES.  BAD HABITS BY ED SHEERAN HERE:  https://youtu.be/nSJHGPTeV18 BAD HABITS BY ED SHEERAN HERE:  https://youtu.be/nSJHGPTeV18 BAD HABITS BY ED SHEERAN HERE:  https://youtu.be/nSJHGPTeV18
Bruno thinks he's Dresser from The 5   Heartbeats 😄 and he ..."don't know shit! Hold my cane."😂🤣
I don’t think it’s legal to be this fly
There is really only one question... Are Bruno and Anderson having as much fun doing this as it looks like they are?
Качающие, пездатые, спокойные треки делает он сам, сами послушайте  https://youtu.be/uZr94VxTM7U
they boyin it 🤣
The way the camera panned out and Anderson was still lying on the floor is hilarious!
This vintage vibe is getting kind of old with Bruno
Since when did bruno mars start calling a girl a bitch after all the fatal songs he took out of how a sucker he was for love ?????
WHY DOES THIS HIT SO HARD!!!
ti amo Bruno❤️
I just love this song
Bruno Mars, I've been admiring this artist since i was young and still knew, it was A Prodigy. A world Class Artist. PAAK just a great discovery.
Bruno Mars as always makes a fire record, even if it's just a 70's or 80's tribute. Sometimes he goes a bit too far and it feels like cosplay, but man his band is good.
This song is laced
Lawd... this takes me back in the day!! Love it! <3
Bruno Mars went from catch a grenade for you to throwing a grenade at you 💀😂
Es sorprendente el trabajo de estos dos músicos cada vez presentan unos temas de primera son éxitos Bruno y Soni son estupendos
Gucci man I see you 😂😂😂
Русские, которые кайфанули с этой музыки.
the way bruno said this bitch bruh and anderson on the floor makes it so much more funnier
It's songs like this that give me hope about this generation's music.
The music is nice but why use the word “bitch”… makes me bad 😞
Smooth as hell
I love this!!!! More more more lol
1:44 The best music video in the world!!😭😂🔥
OMG - Thank you sooooooo much for doing this - this is just what we need during this time.  I'm old enough to be around when this genre was what was up.  I needed this laugh!  Perfectly executed - right on point!!!
This number one ☝️ wow garbage
Song gets better every time you listen to it.
BABE...
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
MY LOVE HEY HI
MY BABY BRUNO MY HUSBANMD
Thumping the cigarettes would have been epic at the end or maybe I just wanted to do mine. Love this
Almost year 2022 and an artist like this so talented, so intelligent, singing such ridiculous macho lyrics is a sign that he must live in a parallel world! I always admired his art, although I always noticed some of these contradictions in him. Now, in this clip, in addition to all that male chauvinism, he makes an apology for cigarettes, what a shit he's doing with his art? When he could help revolutionize the world for the better and not help the world to remain as it always was. Deplorable!
Love it
I wanna see a Akeem Ali feature, get some Pimp rhymes in there
Damn this is so good
Damn we've been waiting forever for this album to drop since March. This shit is 🔥🎶
Não erra nunca 👏🤩
they're so cool
EXTRAORDINARILY MAGNIFICENT !!!!!!!!!!  💯
When you get tired of simping over someone who ain't worth it!!💯💯🔥
This video reminds me of Treasure by Bruno
Observe a letra desta música. A mulher sendo um objeto, paguei portanto ela é minha.  Essa vadia me fez pagar seu aluguel, pagar as viagens....  Mas também espero que você, sua inútil, ande por aí descalça nessas ruas.... Pensei que essa garota pertencia somente a mim...  Música não é só Groove ela traz uma mensagem que vai além do ritmo.
Straight looking like the Temptations with the moves. Bringing back that Motown sound, loving it.
It’s already been 4 days since this song came out and it’s still number one on the music charts here on YouTube
Was thinking it was Dave Chappelle  singing when Pak first sang.
..... BEST SONG OF 2021!!!!! SILK SONIC ARE MY SPIRIT ANIMALS!!!
Bruno really threw the grenade back
Am not sure about my reaction right now. This song gat me laughing, smiling, and shaking my head🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😄
It's crazy how many people come back to this everyday. This song is legendary.
Em pleno século 21 um artista como esse tão talentoso, tão inteligente, cantar uma letra machista ridícula dessas é sinal que ele deve viver um mundo paralelo! Sempre admirei sua arte, embora sempre notei algumas dessas contradições nele. Agora, nesse clipe, além desse machismo todo, ele faz apologia ao cigarro, que grande merda ele está fazendo com a sua arte quando poderia ajudar a revolucionar o mundo para melhor e não ajudar o mundo a permanecer como sempre foi. Lamentável!
Bruno threw the Grenade right tf back                (Yes not an original comment but still hella funny)
Hits machine!
Oof...time to delete those onlyfans accounts
Who hurt him 💀
This has got to be his best song yet 😂😂
I love youu silk sonic!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️

I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH!!!!!!!
Bruno is the definition of "she took advantage of my kindness" now he went from catching the grenade for her to throwing that hoe
excelente!!!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Chuck e. Cheese?? 😂
Never disappoint
The comedy in the song and choreography makes this song even better.
brooooo, i been sayin for years this man knows that that old smooth feel will always be classic and cant be beat...my only question is WHO HURT THIS MAN?!   i felt every line of this so close to my heart, this man gotta be protected you feel me, we holdin' interviews for all potential relationships from now on...period lol
Marlboro stonks
Bring the 80s 90s back
This is a masterpiece🤩
OMG......this is bangin'
The vocals.🔥🔥🔥
"Not to be dramatic but I wanna die... This bia got me paying her rent, paying for trips!" This is the Simp National Anthem! #sheforthestreets #smokinoutthewindow

When he was on the floor I died 😭😭
that is the smoothest verbal violation i've ever heard  she belongs to e'rybody - she's been with everybody she belongs to the city-she belongs to the streets gotta give her back to the city- damn you already know this one
Nigga went from "catch a grenade for ya"..to this real quick😂😂
“Dis B**** (cigarette flick)” too smooth 😂😂🤣
💗💗💗
Can they ever make a song that's average? IMPOSSIBLE
The Jackson 4
Bruno threw back the grenade instead of catching it for his lover
this so crazy 🔥🔥😭
Good music is back
17 million in 4 days...... 💕💕💕
Love love Anderson pakk….but I’m not feeling this group …comes off as fake and corny
واوووو😭😭😭
Good job guys one my favorite songs thank you for this song hood bless you guys 🤙🏽🤙🏽
These lyrics are hilarious 😂😂 I ABSOLUTELY ❤️❤️
So basically she belong to the Streets 🤣🤣
Wow, what happened 🥺🤮💀☠️🤢?
This Is Amazing
Wow
One masterpiece after the other
Fee days ago my breakup has happen...And it seems like bruno has made this song for me.
So happy that the 70s is back.
I’m dead 😂😂😂
How to spill the tea about your ex without looking rude :
Am I the only one finding humor in "not to be Dramatic but I want to die"and next thing he's dramatically laid on the floor 😂😂
The feminism just disappear of my body
That is funny.  If a song can be real life.
💕💕💕💕💕
Anderson Paak with the "this bitch got me" and the cigarette ash had me cracking the hell up!!!
Apaixonada!
Ok but smoking out the window is better for your clothes and walks not to get that gross yellow tint
Just grose 🤮
Que musica meus amigos, que musica!
He really did a whole 360 with this one
Reigniting  an ol'skool vibe with real smooth jams and lyrics! Love it!
I’m just here because of tete lol
Are the background dancers super tall or are Bruna and Paak SUPER short?
Lol!
Impossible, utterly impossible to watch this video without moving to the beat in your seat.
Remember… it may look “cool” on this video… but smoking is bad for your lungs, kids! 🥴 It is ironic that they’re singing and “smoking” at the same time 😬  I’d hope it’s that fake cigarette thing.  And Yes, that IS a thing for those who don’t know. Look it up.
🔥🔥😭
That Hercules reference from The Nutty Professor lol
This track groovy
Que homem PERFEITO! Nunca erra em nada!
The beat stomping at 1:20 does something else to my brain
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When the homies stay close after finding out they all dated the same toxic bitch 😂
So grateful somebody out here making good music. Thank you!
Did yall notice the man playing the drums he looked like a older and shorter hair man of Bruno
The comments are the sequel😂😂
Are they allowed to have that much swagger in one video?
They snapped 😂 this is officially my number fav song
Those backup singers/dancers are just so cool
Legendary like always🙌🏽🔥
jeff bezo's new song
SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Smoking may be harmful to your health...and trifling a$$ women too! 🤣   Can y'all imagine SILK SONIC performing this live on Soul Train with Don Cornelius?
For school I'm doing a presentation on you haha
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
They blew the doors off with this one
So cold
Bruno mars literally went from  2010: “I’d catch a grenade for you” to  2021: wanting to throw a grenade at you
Wow... hebat keren .. salam dari Aceh
LUV u!
I’m just here wondering how many of y’all got the “Hercules, Hercules!” reference 😂😂 I haven’t seen that mentioned in a minute!
Brilliant !!
please make a music video where the whole band sing in a driving car <3
Come thru!!! Bruno!!!
They put all of Pop and R&B on notice. No more BS music. Finally!!
wauw
bruno’s gripping that cigarette for dear life😂😂no more catching grenades💀
3 minutes and 20 seconds of silk sonic trying to say she belongs to the streets in every way possible except saying she belongs to the streets 🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏
So we just going to ignore that future Jesus tattoo on Anderson .Paak chest?🤣🤣 I'm dead "sensational"💀
This is 100
Going to be album of the year ✨
I feel like Bruno's going back through the decades the further his career goes. He does 90s/80s a few years back with Versace on the Floor and Finesse. Now we're in the 70s. Wondering what the 60s/50s will sound like
*i legit thought they were gonna say "cause she belongs to the streets"* 🤣🤣🤣
I am absolutely DONE 💀  Andy laid out on the floor had me ROLLING! Then he just gonna pop back into the shot! LOL Bruno Mars is the greatest entertainer EVER & SILK SONIC is FLAWLESS!! My man said shorty's kids was running around his house like it's Chuck E Cheese 🤣  Then Andy said he hope she find what she looking for, but also hopes she's walking round barefoot in these streets! COLDBLOODED 🥶  Just go 'head and put SILK SONIC in the Rock n Roll HOF now!
Eeeeeeeseer
Big Tobacco really steppin up it's native advertising game 😂
I grew up with bruno mars music I was around 9 when bruno mars started I'm gonna be 20 in less than a month and I gotta say hes never had a bad song
Ohhh yes❤️
I can’t believe his whole album is like from 80’s. 😅…but the language. That’s would be no go in 80’s.
застрял в образе парень, уже не интересно
Temptations would be proud 😂
so beautyful sooong
(U all r 2 stupid, just Hellah funny)  LOVE N IT !!!  Like ,DJ Khaled would say............... IT'S ANOTHER 1# 100🤑!!!
Que música da porra ❤️
1:43 ninoy cosplay
Ela pode ter feito tudo isso com vcoe mas tem eu aqui precisa nem me dá diamante só o seu amor basta Bruno😂😂😂😂 TNC VIBE BOA DO CARAMBA SLC ELES JUNTOS ARRASSA PERFEITOS  ❤️❤️
This is such a vibe I cant get over this song 😩💖
Lmfao!!
Seeing this long ass title for the 3rd time already makes me know this song is gonna be a BANG
lets have the album already lol
this has no reason being this hard
That’s what y’all asses  get for leaving the door open! …..lol
Love the old skool feel of this song while still getting the message across.  Great execution
The way bruno mars Bent his neck when he sing the  "this b*tch got me paying her rent" part got me lmao🤣🤣
Me ponen la piel de gallina!!! Que increíble y poderosa voz ☺️
Absolutely legendary. Every note so clean!
Bruno is the ultimate performer.  He is the michal Jackson of this center with a tad of vocals on top🤤🤯
less than 1 year .. and he get enough so he is singing about changing the door lock .. lol
Lo amé. Es tan bello y gracioso a la vez 💛🧡💛
every bruno mars song has an amazing vibe HES SO TALENTED!!!
Soul Train LIVES!!!
They really said: she belongs to the streets (soul version)
Finally! A song for Chuckie Cheese!...LOL
Bruno explains how you are on drums and singing at the same time?😂😂 😂
I know this man snorted a whole lotta crack for this 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😍😍😍😍😍😍 Sing it Bruno
😆😆😆😆😆😆
I thought he was dead 😳but the way he awake up 😭😭
They are doing cigarette advertisement.
Here before i die ticket
This so fine period.
this man is TOO SMOOTH !!!!!!!! 😊
why is this giving Shigure to Akito vibes… fruits basket stan, iykyk
This song is telling you not to be a simp.....
How does this man keep doing it. Hit after hit.
on repeat
I'm just very happy to be living in the same decade as Bruno Mars
To everybody,  everybody 🎶🎶
Cool!
I love the duo!!! Anderson on the floor is everything to me. 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
I wanna smoke cigarettes now
Bruno Mars wasn't live in the present.
Nah. In theory yes, but in execution no. Just a worse version of I'm going to leave the door open. When you tap into the 70's it should be pure, but this is a 70's parody.
Is that a Bruno Mars's dad?! 😮
Lmfao!!!
Daaaaaamn! SO MUCH TALENT 🔥👑❤️
🔥🔥🔥💯
Sounds like someone is taking notes from Marc Rebillet.
Damn they killed it
I never live in 70's by you got me there!Peace!✌
This reminds me of some old-school R&B I love this..
Awesome song!! I enjoyed this video
Amo 🥺🥰❤️
BEST SONG EVER MADE!!!
This man is singing about simping 🤣
pimps be like...
I wish he do a song with Syd from the internet it would be amazing 😊
2:09 classiest way to say "she belongs to the streets"💀
Don't know why but I'm feeling those shoes lol
This thang 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH OMG
Whoa i just realized that Leave the Door open , Skate with me Baby , And Smokin out the Window is telling a story ! Leave the door open is him attracting the lady he is basically saying come to me baby . Then Skate to Me Baby is  about their relationship and how good it it is going so far . Finally  (so far ) is about how that same woman that he gave everything to is now leaving him and was just using him for money .   If you don't believe me listen to all the songs in order and then listen to the lyrics you will see what talking about also their is ,more to this story you could an essay about it but imma keep it simple, don't want my laptop crashing now
Musical version of ' she's for the streets'
Bruh who hurt Bruno? 🤣
Was wondering how they gonna follow up that banger "leave the door open"  but this is so smooth, unique, beautiful 👏👏👏👏
Love the old school  r&b.After watching several times, just noticed, Paak is wearing a diamond necklace and bracelet.Too funny.
They giving me J5 vibes 💯🔥
This is song is 😮‍💨
Dope song. I can hear Snoop Dogg and Kemmy Casanova on a remix
Who pissed them boys up 😩
they should really come out with a Christmas album.
⏳
My heart omg
Bruno just went Ratchet in this song ...😂😂😂😂😂... I still love it though... ❤❤
Never ignore a person who loves you, cares for you, misses you. Because one day, you might wake up from your sleep and realize that he made a song about sending you back to the city <3 <3 <3
I just saw and ad for this and I'm hooked!
When he died...and laid there ...💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂😂
ima play this round my future kids and shout whatcha young bucks know bout this 🤣🤣🤣
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💯💯💯👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Smoothest way to diss
You are unique, I love you
These guys have become the greatest musical duo of the century!
PLZ WE NEED MORE 💳💳💳💳
Blue pill simp anthem…. N it slaps 😆
Hit after hit. They just keep doing it!
❤
They snapped on that song. It's hilarious. The way he died and got back up 😆😆😆 not to be dramatic...
This B got me.....that part took me out 😂😂😂😂
🔥
Ya es de otro planeta
The story of my motherfucking life
They got to change the definition of smooth to: silk sonic 😂
Yooooooooooo, they did that!
the same melody same shit sound exactly like leaving the door open also beat sound like erkra bud ha beat sample
that beat reminds me of old school rap
Who tf disliked this!? 😂
The song is great but no gf/bf is worth getting lung cancer over.  Stay smoke free folks.
I KNEW IT!!! Sammy Davis, Jr. is NOT dead!!! He's right thurrr!!!!
This is so fire !  so genius! I love you guys 😍

My man went from catching grenades for his women to this.
He looks like Sammy Davis Jr but sound like Smokey….. shit I’m now a fan of Bruno…. This shit had me grooving and laughing
I love! 🇧🇷🥰
We have all maybe just witness the birth of musical genius. From the music, to the lyrics, and the video concept itself. It exceeds all expectations. 👏👏👏👏👏👏
OK, it's 12 am and I'm jamming on this....
Song of the decade
Who the fook thought it was OK or COOL to use, mention or talk about cigarettes. Dude it's 2021!! ;)
He really singing the chorus with Paak on the ground cigarette up😭😭
😍😍😍😍
1:36
Anderson Paak. Sounds exactly like this live. A day in my life I'd gladly relive 🔥
KEVIN SAMUELS APPROVED
I literally do it every night. Smoking out the window, thinking how could she do this to me.
Ok Jackson 5
this is SO GOOD OMG
Nobody has made a modern old school album before....💯💯💯💯
Looks, feels, and sounds like a love song but lyrics say NOPE.
women am i right
LMAO
Their sound is so fresh but old school , they never miss a bop yo!
Anderson .paak pulling an undertaker makes this video!!
Bruno Mars - Can't get over how much I love your music
Anderson getting back up from the dead showed me I can come back from anything life throws at me. Can't wait for the full album.
I wish Tyler the creator was on this too.
This song been on repeat all day a whole vibe
Incredible. Nice to hear some decent new music in 2021.
But who are these unhappy, groovless, humorless, soulless aliens that disliked this genius jam? What is waking up like?
THISSSS BITCH ~ Bruno mars
their outfits ♥
This is legendary😂😂😂
He laid out on that flo! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Супер топ 11
T  H  I  S      B  I  T  C  H  H     got me paying for rent         paying for trips.

This is an actual bop I’m pretty sure even the hood niggas felt this😭😂
damn i love these guys so much
Nice song..but in this generation men are allowed to cheat.. ok bye
Anderson .Paak playing dead on the ground is the exact same energy as Carmelo Anthony laying in the paint as the game goes on around him 😂😂😂 iykyk
Love the 70’s vibe..when he starts talking lol every 70’s kid remembers those songs lol
Silk sonic is just another level
Bruh I love this so much.
esta mieerda esta que arde
Got that beige carpet and no cigarette burns on it? That's the most impressive part of this video.
Bruno I'm coming for my feature
Bruno I'm coming for my feature
This is so funny omg 😂 love how they’re bringing back this kinda music for some of us with old souls ❤️
This nigga threw the grenade back
LOVE!!!
I'm mesmerized
I love Adele, and I know we haven’t heard 30 yet, but she should not take home the Grammy for album of the year over this duo.. These guys have dropped 3 classics. Not MODERN classics, but CLASSICS that will stand the test of time! Truly phenomenal work by Silk Sonic.
BEAST 🔥🔥🔥
This song and video had me tears...was it suppose to be funny?
This bi**h got me...😂😂😂
Amusing
Man they even prepared the blood for Anderson nahhh
I’m sorry my part is This bitch😂😂😂😂
Always deliver unique performance
The Anderson Paak Jump scare tho
I'm here for it!!! Love these two together!
Ouch !
I’ve probably listened to this song 10 times so far.. Ok, maybe 20..
That's a sweet song 🎵
I've just watched some ladies reactions to this song ! And they all melted 😅😅😅 Silk Sonic have slayed it again.
Anderson. Paak: Not to be dramatic but i want to die Proceeds to lying still on the floor
Is it me or when had Bruno ever referred to a female as bitch ? 🤣😭😭
Real grown ass man shit right here...
Damn Bruno Mars went from leave the door open to I’ll like you to leave  😂😂😂😂 . He threw the Granada at you girl 😂
damn
Bruno meant that shit 😂😂
I need this for my birthday 🎁 Christmas or whatever 🥺
Four cool dudes crooning about a bad bitch is the silkiest thing my ears experienced today🎵🎼🎶
This whole album 🔥 aye 💃!
Can't wait for all the tik toks and reels for "oh no" and "I wanna die" 😂
I'm offended
I like this song ✊🏾✊🏾
🐐🐐🐐🐐🦾🦾🦾🦾 great song &funny
I love it❤❤❤❤
Fumando Na Janela (part. Anderson .Paak) Espera um pouco, esse amor começou tão tímido e tão doce Mas agora ela me deixou (fumando na janela)  Devo ter gastado trinta e cinco, quarenta e cinco mil em joias Tiffany (oh, não) Os pirralhos dela estão correndo por toda minha casa Como se fosse o Chuck E Cheese Me deixou em apuros com o ex-namorado dela, que está no UFC Não posso acreditar (não posso acreditar) Estou incrédulo  Essa vadia me fez pagar seu aluguel, pagar as viagens Diamantes no pescoço dela, diamantes no seu pulso E aqui estou, completamente sozinho (completamente sozinho) Estou com tanto frio, estou com tanto frio Você me deixou  Fumando na janela (fumando na janela) Cantando: Como ela pôde fazer isso comigo? (Como ela pôde fazer isso comigo?) Pensei que essa garota pertencia a mim Mas eu estava errado Porque ela pertence a todos, a todos, oh  Ainda outra noite, ela estava me agarrando com força Gritando: Hércules (Hércules, Hércules) Me fez ir para a boate em busca de um novo amor Alguém me ajude, por favor (me ajude, por favor, me ajude, por favor)  Amor, por que você está fazendo isso? Por que você está fazendo isso comigo, garota? Não é sendo dramático, mas quero morrer  Essa vadia me fez pagar seu aluguel, pagar as viagens Diamantes no pescoço dela, diamantes no seu pulso E aqui estou, completamente sozinho (completamente sozinho) Estou com tanto frio, estou com tanto frio Você me deixou  Fumando na janela (fumando na janela, fumando na janela do Benzo, do Benzo) Cantando: Como ela pôde fazer isso comigo? (Como? Como você pôde fazer isso comigo?) Pensei que essa garota pertencia somente a mim (uma coisa é certa, uma coisa é certa) Mas eu estava errado (eu estava errado) Porque ela pertence (ela pertence a) a todos, a todos (sim, ela pertence a todos) Aquela garota ali, ela pertence a todos  (Oh, não) Veja bem, amor Espero que você encontre o que quer que você precise Mas também espero que você, sua inútil, ande por aí descalça nessas ruas Preste atenção  Garota, parte meu coração que você não esteja aqui comigo Agora preciso te devolver (preciso te devolver) Para a cidade, oh, você me deixou  Fumando na janela (oh) Cantando: Como ela pôde fazer isso comigo? (Como você pôde? Como você pôde fazer isso, amor?) Pensei que essa garota pertencia somente a mim Mas eu estava errado (eu estava errado) Porque ela pertence (ela pertence) a todos, a todos (sim, ela pertence a todos) Ela pertence a todos, oh.

I'm mostly a nerdy metalhead but this shit is pure gold 10/10. Can't wait for the album.
Someone said it right i want to see the outtakes of this video !
Whooooo!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Swear I love Bruno and his crew
0:16 OH NO!  WHY THE WAY IN WHICH ANDERSON HAS SAID IT IS SO SATISFYING?   its a born meme😂😂🤣🤣
ESQUEÇA TUDOOOOOOO
I found this by searching this bi😂😂💀
This is old school and new school at it's best!! Anderson Paak looking like a new school Bobby Womack! Lololololololololol 🤣💖💖💖💖💖💖
Another mega tune from the smoothest cats in the music business…… Salute fellas
smoky robinson & the miracles were classy and said the same thing about being hurt without saying the b word. motown not misogyny!
It’s 2021 and promoting Cigarettes smfh why couldn’t they smoke on some tree instead 💨🤣
Bruno Mars music is the old rb. Good music, love it. They all can sing.
Bruno looks like Sammy Davis jr. here
Bruno left the door open and BAM now she done got him smoking out of the window  😂😂😂😂😂😂  Bruno close the door next time and await for your Queen goddess
Who hurt you Bruno lol
Música muitooo boaaaa
This has gotta be the best album of the year
viciei nesse cigarro mané
This sounds more like one of those joke songs from wild n out than anything else. This dude just stopped making heart felt music back in like 2012 and ever since he appears like once a year to release the same song over and over.
1:35 Anderson just died like that, 1:51 Then dude Popped-up like a f-king Jack-in-the-Box.. HAHA
LMFAO I LOVE IT
I am also wondering how could they do this to me on my mid term day
Can’t wait for JK to cover this  Hopefully it will have a somewhat pg version lol
Passando pra avisar que sou fã raiz
She for the streets !
Não falo nenhuma palavra em inglês, mas esse sim é top!❤❤❤❤❤
Anderson Paak lying on the ground 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

He ain’t finna catch a grenade for no hoe anymore
It's official, this is my fucking anthem this fall/winter.
Just the perfect song to play at full spite when the girl you're seeing is what the song is talking about HAHAHAHA
I've commented before but I need to say something else. The video is awesome, the vocals are amazing, and it's funny as hell. Why nobody talking about them damn old school dance moves though? They was GETTIN IT!!!!!! I love the way Bruno dances. He does little subtle movements but they be fire and look so smooth.
Keep it coming i love this collaboration. This is what real music sounds like.
Don’t know if this was meant to be funny, but it gave me the laughs I definitely needed! 😂 Thanks Silk Sonic! And I got grenades for whoever hurt you Bruno.
👑

Música nova uaaauu

Fuck who ever gave this thumbs down.  This is the shit!!
This video right here! I laughed so hard, great lyrics, music, the dancing is on point but when he fell out on the floor, I was done! LOL. This is genius!
Definition of generational artistry!!!
1:10 I'm crying 😭😭
1:46 Paak just laying on the ground 😭😭😭 im DEADDDDD
I love Paak. He’s so damn funny, if you haven’t check out his tiny desk. Dude should be in the dictionary under “come up”.
Can somebody answer me this how is it that Andre 3000 song roses that sounds like a old 70s type feel get so much recognition and so much radio play but Bruno Mars hit after hit not being play as much as that Andre 3000 song 🤔🧐
I'm 90s kid ,, I never forget 90s classic music 🎵🎶 this music like vintage 90s I love it ,, 😍 Love u ( Bruno ) Love from india 🇮🇳
This song is ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Those are some magic cigarettes being the same size after burning for a while lol
They can do no wrong, pure genius
I wish they didn’t give me parody vibes and made it a real song
1:36 free replay 4 myself
Perfect for next Victoria Secret’s show 😁

Love You Bruno and Pak..Boosie Collins (70s Soul Funk Icon) actually created the Group (Silk Sonic). GENIUS!!! 21st Century New Edition  in "THEME" of Bobby Womack "Everybody Plays the Fool" .Bruno Vocal affliction in "High Notes" Bobby Debarge of the Band "Switch" or Lenny Williams.Pak "Dramatic Fall" Reminiscent of James Brown "Cape"being thrown on him. "Hercules, Hercules"( Eddie Murphy Nutty Professor"..(John Witherspoon)" Help me, Help  me Please(early 90s sitcom "The Wayne's Brothers"). Its James, The Delfonics, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Marvin Gaye..Thank You Guys for those of us Youngsters with Old Soul's.

This is hilarious!  Not to be dramatic, but I want to die🤣🤣🤣 Anderson Paak🤦🏻‍♀️  They’re even holding cigarettes like they’re stressed. Bruno went from catching grenades to throwing them right back🤣
I dig this so deep.
That Chuck E Cheese part......😂😂
That “here I am all alone” with Anderson Paak on the floor near took me out. Then when he reappeared out of nowhere I had to pause it. Howling laughing 😂
Yo, who hurt Bruno? Ima have to fight somebody for lil man
Go baby I love you and I’m proud of you Bruno!😘
It's been 14 years I'm rocking with him and he never disappoints 😁
Fil-Am Bruno Mars❤️ PROUD FILIPINO 🖐️

Bang bikin lagu sadboy lagi
Bruno not simping anymore 😂🔥🔥🔥
So dramatic lol; always love to see artists having fun
This song is gold!
He went from “That’s what I like” to “I’d like you to leave”
😂Anderson Paak laid out on the ground while Bruno continues to sing like nothing happened😂”I hope your trifling ass walking around barefooted in these streets “😂
didnt even make it halfway through the song before texting my bf "this reminds me of your ex"
Idk how Bruno dose it
Hell yeah bruno mars bringin out a banger everytime 🔥🔥
I don't have words to describe this song and to describe who you are for me, thank you for helping me move on every day.  I love you so much!

The "Oh Noo" and "whoa whoa" Is too addictive 😂
I desperately wanted to NOT  like this song!!! But it got me once again!! 🤣🤣
This is pure 🔥 at its best … much needed music
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love this music. The video...everything!! Looks like ya all had a blast making this vid...
That cigarette never dies out
Bruno going from "I'll catch a grenade for ya." To "Imma get the hell away from ya." From: "Imma leave the door open" To "Imma fucking change the locks." From "When I was your man." To "When I gave a damn."  Anyone got more?
those move are damn smooth tho
this looks like so much fun
I bet this gonna be the new trending song on TikTok
'' not to be dramatic but i wanna die'' lmfao. ikr such a mood
Fresh air into a sea of sh.....

The audacity this female he’s speakin about has
This is what happens when you simp for the wrong person
God this entry from Anderson Paak in 1:16 is sooo good
This is like the 70s pre cursor to “Calling all My Lovelies”.
I wish I could give a "like" more than once, coz every time  I listen to it, I want to add another like.... :v And I have heard it like 20 times already....
Bruno Mars is so entertaining! 🤣
Screaming Hercules...Hercules!!! Give Eddie Murphy his props then!! They so damn clever together! DIS BITCH...lmao THEY NEED TO DO A CHRISTMAS ALBUM! 🎄

*Never ignore a person who loves you, cares for you, misses you. Because one day, you might wake up from your sleep and realize that you lost the moon while counting the stars 👍*
Going to buy this album, it sounds like soo much damn fun, I love it!
Another hit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song is basically just: "She belongs to the streets."
Dudes rock

PLEASE MAKE A CHRISTMAS ALBUM!! WITH THE VOCALS THIS BAND HAS. A CHRISTMAS ALBUM SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
Bruno and Paak goes together like gin and coke!

The Aura this man exudes is just Breath takkkkkkkkkkkiiiinnggggg
This song is a whole vibe.
On repeat 🎶🎶
바이브 미쳤다 진짜 저 특유의 절도있는 꽉찬 흐물거림이 너무 좋음 ㅋㅋ
i jus wanna be a background dancer for silk sonic
Not him on the floor
I was going to say I can't relate to this song. But then I am paying for everything right now....
Lmmfao 😂😭😭😭😭😭😭🔥
I'm not going to lie. Everyone one is going to try to hit that Burno Mars high note at the end in the car or the shower!!  Just anywhere 🤣🤣🤣
AN ODE TO CLASSIC R&B, DOO WOP AND BLUES. Standing freaking ovation!! And one time for BOOTSY COLLINS!!!!!! Jeesh
Bruno Mars is the final frontier of sexy for men.
Thank you guys for bringing back REAL MUSIC!!!!
whenever i see anderson paak all I remember is him falling off a table T.T
Bruno went from "when i was your man" to "when i gave a damn"
This group>>> we need a Christmas album with Mariah Carey
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪👈
Always a hit 🤘
i know you millennials think this is "classic soul" we didnt call our women "bitch". this is brainwashing. Let me pull up the times Marvin gaye called women bitch in a song... Or the temptations. Or smokey. this is a dude from Hawaii blackfacing us with the help of our own damn people.
Lets appreciate everyone's acting skills for going on and not laughing when Anderson Paak dies and comes back 😂😂
1971 with 2021 bs
This is smoother than butter, bruh.
XXXTENTACION MOONLIGHT (INDIAN VERSION)  R.I.P X  🙏🏾  😔  🎧  👇🏾 https://youtu.be/aGgxeTfVR18
they took CLASSIC SOUL, then superimposed hip hop bullsh** cursing and swearing on it. Why dont you Jew owned labels attack WHITE people with this? go make classic country and call your women "bitch" ---that'll be a long day in hell before THAT happens.
Gem after Gem! 💯  This world doesn’t deserve falsetto Bruno 😭
Bruno and Anderson are just on true fire!! Silk Sonic is going to the top!!! 💜💜
The way this fool keeps popping up on the screen in front of Bruno is hilarious.
Breathing life back into the music industry.  Thank you!
Sou seu fã, mas não gostei do uso do cigarro no clipe, talvez seja esse o motivo de vários likes negativos.
If you are reading this, please don't smoke. Ain't cool.
Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist and I’m out here all alone!! Boy I swear this one hit home for sure🤦🏾‍♂️😜
1:43  this is everything
OMG he was dead on the floor with the microphone in his hand 🤦🏽‍♀️
Got bruh laying on the floor dead 💀🤣🤣🤣Love this
This gives me 70s vibes.
They said she belongs to the streets 😩😂
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Coming to see you in December baby! 🥰🥰🥰 Can't wait!
This is such a masterpiece.. But still the comedy here is so good😂 I am obsessed :)
Too damn good!!! 🥺🥺🤍🤍✨
My favorite song 🤩
Absolutely fantastic
Another flawless performance. Props. Dont ever stop until you decide. Love it all.
🤣🤯🔥
caralho que música boa da porraaaa
They snapped 😂😂😂 this b took me out cold 😂😂😂😂
This song is heavily inspired on "and the beat goes on" by the whispers.
This is about to be the next song overplayed on the radio all summer…. And I’m here for it
I cant wait to see Snoop Dogg do a reaction vid to this amazing track!
i've rewound it 6 times and havent even hit the 45 seconds marker loool fucking hell bruno mars you are FIRE
I need this album like NOW! Will smoke out the window while leaving the door open listening to it! Damn Groove got me in my feelings like I am living in 1974! 😭😭😭
when a rich man gets heart broken
Lagu tentang sugarbaby wkwk 🤣🤣👍👍👍👍
Future, verse 3 chapter 2: she belongs to the streets
This has a Soul Train kind of Vibe..
The girl belongs to everybody means she is cheating multiple man's at same time 😂
Damn girl we looking at the new temptations here, also they really bringing the pimp swag back too.
I like it!!!!💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
This song isn’t as dope as leave the door open. Not even half of it. I’m a bit disappointed ☹️
1:42 straight up vibing with Anderson
fuck imma sing "dis bitch got me payin her rent" with a passion for the next fifty years
Yesss more music like this. Let auto tune goooooooo.
Bruno droppin nuke after catching a grenade
I think we just found the red pill awakening anthem.
DROP THE DAMN ALBUM, WE’RE WAITING 🧍🏾‍♀️
am i trippin or bruno mars getting skinnier?
Anderson pulling those Bobby Womack vibes...
😊😊😊
Is that Bootsi Collins in the beginning?
Maaaaaaaaaan!!! I told people these to together gonna win a lot of fucking awards!!!
It’s Anderson. paak stickin his head in the frame out of no where for me 😂
Cómo siempre Bruno mars sacando tremendo arte!
mermão que seresta da porra, viva ao rei reginaldo rossi pai de bruno
Pure genius
This song is hilarious and groovy at the same time and I love it. 😂
não podia trocar pro um brocolis ????
Future got to him
This song has everything comedy, soul, and chemistry between two very good artists. Can't wait for the album to drop this week. Absolute 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Having this guys do music while we are living in this earth is a blessing and a history.... No one brings the house down like them, evergreen.. And old school finishes eceuthing.....
The kind of song you'll listen on a road trip
e o cigarro pra mais cancer ?????? desnecessário
I...cant....stop....watching!!!
🇧🇷🎶😍😍😍👏
Muito show!! dançam demais!!
yes
If they do not get the Album of the Year, Best duo, Best group... Best everything @ all the Awards Grammys, AMA's etc... These awards will be irrelevant, definitely irrelevant! This is REAL Music, Composed, Performed by REAL Musicians.
I think future needed a verse on this

(How Could She Do This To Me?) Oh! I Thought That Girl Belonged To Only Me But I Was Wrong 'Cuz She Belong To Everybody, Everybody  [Verse 2: Anderson] Just The Other Night She Was Gripping On Me Tight Screamin' Hercules (Hercules, Hercules) Got Me In The Club Looking For A New Love Someone Help Me, Please (Help Me, Please, Help Me, Please) Baby, Why You Doing This?

This is so fire I'd actually buy a cd of it. Yes, a CD.
Bruh he stopped talking to the moon
i feel like im ascending to heaven
It's the contrast between the sultry and seductive tone of the genre and the complete and utter bitterness and vitriol in the lyrics that just make this song so funny
I was almost going to worship until i realized it was a heartbreak song... Lord have mercy
aaahhh finally my ears got what it deserve after a long time, so refreshing
Love it!!!!
1:36 - 1:45 has me in tears cause he said bitch with so much passion...and homie just laid out on the floor.
Anderson .Paak cosplaying Aquino will always be legendary<3
This is going to be a legacy tune for many years. Wao. Simply one of the best.
Weird
That's What happens when you leave the door open my guy
Equivalent of uncle Future saying that She belongs to the streets
Bruno Mars is the G. O. A. T.

"...Proudly sponsored by American Tobacco Company"
This is genuinely incredible.
mi the whole song: 👁️👄👁️
The ash flick Anderson .Paak is gonna be used in every argument now
Can we all agree those was Newports or menthol?
I would never let a man disrespect me…but also I would happily catch the ash that Anderson just flicked 😩
Lame!.. wait they all have cigarettes, oh nevermind, my bad, they must be relevant and cool.
I think Jesus died for these guys
Somebody had a call of duty moment, and threw the grenade back.
man's 36 looking like 96
“LOVE “ your music  from Japan 💝 Waiting new album so much (*´꒳`*)
If Anderson .Paak keeps smoking like this his voice will go full-on Bobby Womack!!!
It just gets better the more times i listen…
Drum fills for days
Saweetie, listen very closely
60's 70's vibe..
So SMOOTH  🥰 WOW Another HIT                   Perfection 👏
Anderson. Paak could join a Dave Chapelle look-alike contest
Good job guys very very dope
smokin out the WEED dow how KUSH she do it to me?  Is what i hear or imma just high as fck? Hahaha Bruno and paak maan! u did it again 😌👌✨
Bruno Mars' acting during this song is something truly special with Anderson .Paak and Silk Sonic.  Best collab that could've ever happened in this generation of music!
I’ve never called anyone Hercules..yet 😂
These brothers found a way to be smooth, rude, and funny at the same time; GENIUS!!!!
"THIS BITCH" have me dying laughing they say it so hard cause they mad and know they was played😂😂😂😂
Now this is what I call Music!
He is the greatest alive artist of our era! Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak... We needed this partnership to brighten this year a little!!! 🤩🤩
🤙Love these guys for               Keeping MOTOWN Alive !
They went from "superstar is what you are!" to "THIS B!TCH"
When can i meet you Bruno Mars
"i thought she belong to only me, but i was wrong.. she's belong to everybody" 😂💀 i cant"
Bro threw the grenade back "Ima leave the door open" nah man, hes changing the locks. Went from talking to the moon to going right to bed -some Instagram comment
Love you😍#BraZil😍
imagine how many people come here every day, every hours, every minute and every second, this song is really legendary.
Incrível como o Bruno Mars não tem NEM UMA SEQUER MÚSICA RUIM.
Is smoking cool again?
Went from “I think I wanna marry you” to “I think I wanna divorce”
homeboy went from “ima leave the door open” to “ima change the damn locks”
Motown baby!
Simps be hating on this
Let me say it in Swahili....."Hawa Masela Ni Konyo.....Hakuna Kama Wao Zama Hizi". Baaaang!!!!
Is it any good , yes it is , repetition of  70 -80 years , Trammps , Harold Melvin , Four Tops , The O"Jays

Another soulful perfomance brother!
I totally get the retrograde throw back style of this track, personally the drum fills towards the end needs revision given the style are wak, I do get this in a pop context totally and I am not playa hating but please boys you have to light up if you wanna go there, please

Bruno is undoubtedly the most versatile singer of his generation
I just want to get up and dance with them, and put my piece of voice into that song too.
Why is everyone on TikTok saying reminder he’s not black?

1:46 dont mean to be dramatic, still laying on the fucking floor like he dead🤣🤣🤣

"The Nutty Professor "reference though...    Hercules!! Hercules!!
очень странно в 2021-м году не удивлять креативом и современными возможностями, а просто брать и делать кальку на 60-е или 70-е годы! я поставила дизлайк, им побарабану, понятное дело, но разве им не хочется чего-то большего?
DAYUM! That's smooth
GREAT
That Bruno sauce hits the spot every time! Damn!
se loko
Man this cat is doing a phenomenal job of catching elements of those old school melodies and reinventing them for modern audiences but he so talented with it that they made their own lane with it.
here be4 16 mil~
are you kidding… WHAT?!!!!!!! an 𝗜𝗡𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗡𝗧 classic 🤯🔥😍🤌🏼🤌🏼 shit had me screaming, throwing my shoes at the tv screen. if this album doesn’t sweep every single award out there.. then i’ve lost ALL faith in humanity.
💀 Bruno is done. He done closed the damn door 🚪 😂😂😂😂
He closed the door now.
Bruh stop talking to the moon.
They have officially became the new OutKast
Finally a song that I don't need to search for an accoustic cover, I can easily vibe with this song and understand each words. ( even though its funny but SMOOTH)
Man this is a breath of fresh air!  This is a vibe right here.
SO FCKUNH GOOD I KNOW BTS SINGING THIS ONE
Real talent  'FACT'  just is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like how all three vids so far featured the same musicians
Humour and melody ! Never a bad combination 😂😂
Anyone else notice E panda on the drums😭😭😭😭
#1 Trending in NZ 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Спасибо вам, друзья, что вы вспомнили 80-е годы... Славное время, когда сигарета в кадре не расценивалась как пропаганда курения.
Yesssssssssssssssssss......... #badtobloodclaat

Retro music 💗

I love Bruno vibe… he’s a whole mood 🥰
The group we didn't know we needed. Such a genius idea. Bringing back the real flavor to music. Some of the lyrics has me crine tho. Give her back to the city. Not even the streets. She foul. 😂😂🔥🔥🔥
so basically she belongs to the streets
tem três dias q tô voltando nesse vídeo, eles são muito bons mds
playback speed 1.25 hits different
Bruno mara and The Weeknd need to make a song!!!
Gotta give u back to the city killed me lmao
Nice...
Before you invest your life into her. Remember. She belongs to everybody.
He’s not catching a grenade for nobody no more
They sang that with a Capital B!
I am just loving this song guys. The lyrics, the drama. Lol. Guys smoking is not good for your voices
IMPORTANT MESSAGE :D  the only way to Heaven 1) ADMIT THAT YOU’RE A SINNER: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23) No one is good enough to go to Heaven on his own merit. No matter how much good we do, we still come short.  2) REALIZE THE PENALTY FOR SIN: "For the wages of sin is death..." (Romans 3:23) The penalty for our sin is eternal death in a place called Hell. But there is good news, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for our sins, that whoever believes in Jesus should not perish but have everlasting life. ( see John 3:16) 3) BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD: 4) CALL UPON THE NAME OF JESUS: Trust in Jesus alone as your Savior. Jesus loves you and He's waiting for you with his arms wide open. Accept Jesus and repent (which means to confess and forsake your sins)
Bruno makes us wait for so long, but when he comes out, its with STRAIGHT FIRE! FUCKING GOLD!
yes i may re watch this video 2-5 times a day and what about it?
Me: to our cat for 5 years. Looking at me from our neighbors window
Smooth
Mans done went from “drippin in finesse” to “just got finessed”
So there's not gonna be a no smoking psa? Disappointed
Hit after hit!
bruno’s songs were starting to get so bland imo. this collab is what we all and especially he needed 💯
Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak Duo feels like a breath of fresh air from all the crap out here....
Wait Anderson was on the damn floor lol
OMG! these fellas can saaaàaang! Not sing. Every song that they've come out with been good. I'm 49 and I think back to ol skool when mama played albums and 45s on the record player at the house parties!
i’m unhealthily obsessed with this song and video  THIS BITCH GOT ME PAYIN HER RENT, PAYIN FOR TRIPS, DIAMONDS ON HER NECK, DIAMONDS ON HER WRISTSSSSS
So smooth i like that .
wanna see sir Brian Puspos do the smooth dance cover on this masterpiece.
He said gotta give you back to the city 🤣🤣
Pure retro disco soul dance on the se days,  how lucky we are guys
Lets bring back the 70s 80s fashion style
This is music!! Silk Sonic is kinda one of my favorite groups now…
Just tell me How "Silk Sonic" wont will all the possible Grammies
They truly opened a time capsule for the new generation... Magnificent.
Anderson Paak and Bruno are match made in heaven.
Gracias Silk Sonic por esto
Only anderson paak make bruno mars as his back singer 😂
From door to window. I wonder whats next 🤣
Wow wow wow
Glad Anderson .Paak is gettiing the respect he deserves. Still many more such artists to go!
Bruno not taking grenade for you now
Anderson. Paak: Not to be dramatic but i want to die Proceeds to lying still on the floor Lmao.
bruno mars is never disapointed
Getting some Jackson 5 vibe while listening to my fav Artist! How good can this be? just wow
This the song imma play at my cookout when I’m 50
You smokin hot musicians by heart.
Whoever worked the cameras really caught the smoothness of the song, like dam. Props to the people working in the set
I really love it So relaxing
We need carpool karaoke with these two
This is my song! 😂 it’s winning some kind of Grammy for sure
I still via 🪟smoke
Dig the video!  Straight 70s throwback!!
Why this feel like a bit from SNL??
This feels like a song from my childhood. I'm here for it.
To say this album is going to create waves in the music industry is a horrible understatement. I am SO excited for it to drop!
My man ain't simp no more
Hahaha this lyrics though I can't 😂👌🤣😅😍😆😂
Hahaha she's for the streets 🤣😂😆
Smokin hot! Simply amazing
Hahahahaa funny but too cool not to listen to...smoking outta window yeah
She belong to the streets bro
So weird seeing Anderson.Paak not on drums lmao
Why they got to say the word bish??
Freshest music this 2021. Chill with smoke.  That bridge line with Anderson .Paak really got me. Sad song but smooth as butter is the sound start to finish.
Another brilliant music! I’ve been listening to this for the past 2 days! My new favorite 🤩
This generation needs to being thankful they have some good songs they can actually sing when they are older and not suggest they be sent to a nursing home. Good music!
Gamma male woe set
This hit difficult when you been threw it. It jam doe.
This song is not on the same level of the first 2 releases and I still dig
This is giving some real soul train vibes.
Bruno Mars, the legend of 21st century
I can't stop laughing at these damn lyrics! Love love love this song!! My Summer Jam ❤
So smooth.....coffee in the morning smooth
💪💪💪
wow. perfect.
We got leave the door open, then smoking out the window. What’s next? Coming through the chimney?
This is the best
These guys are hilarious. Straight comedy. Playing dead on the floor was the icing on the cake. They need an extended version of this song and video.
Bruno looking a bit too good here
WOOOWW
DAYMMM SMOOOVVTTHH
Thought Anderson Paak done saying the word Bitch, so he really meant it when he said BITCH😂
..Klasse richtig gut Pop Music auf hohem Niveau... mit witz...
Smoky silkyyyyyyyyyyyyy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Good Vibes..Good Music
Straight r&b. No hip hop and r&b. Just r&b.  I forgot how real r&b sounded like.
Wow smooth sweet sounds ❤️

Bruno Mars on his knees.  Bruunee's
HAHAHAH lowkey criticism for his b**ch HAHAHAHA
BRUNO MARS SIKU ZOTE WALLAHI❤😂

Should've left that door closed
RnB is still Alive
Can’t wait to see the live performance of this song.
So this songs about being a simp basically lol
I wonder how the girl they sing the song for is feeling rn? 😭
Best collab
no words
Now that’s how you sing, people!
That's what happens when you leave the door open 🤓😂
Omg chunk chesses
"she belongs to the streets" = "She belongs to everybody" Future but RnB = A. Paak & Bruno 😂😂😂😂😂 Another classic
started listening to bruno since 2012 and i will still keep listening.🙂
Bruno ain't catching grenades again that's for certain 😂😂😂
It's the faint for me Anderson paak is amazing 😆😆😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bruno and Anderson sound like two bros just venting about toxic relationships and singing like angels and I respect the H out of that
Ear balm🤎
This 🎶 bitch🎶
I usually listen to Progressive Metal and Black Gaze but I feel so heavily attracted by this 🖤.
I like this better than leave the door open and skate
i love the faded video effect or whatever its called
Meanwhile Ed Sheeran is making mindless pop
Crazy that this song was born all the way back in 2016/2017 during the 24k Magic tour!
see now! I want them to legendarily combine and become something together group wise, but they’re all mighty kings alone as artists. That they need to stay exactly as this long titles and all!
nice song Paak,and Bruno
Is that bootsy voice in the intro????
Dear Bruno and Andre.. maynl I please be your female reply voice? We will make majic 💯🔥💯🔥🔥🔥 hot lyrics.. now and forever.. hit meeeeeeee 💯🔥💜
Being a kpop stan's got me singing this with my whole chest 😂
Slutshaming has never felt so good
Bruno mars went from “when I was your man” to “when I gave a damn”             *Not original*
I love the way they dance
SAANNNGG THAT SHIIIIITTTT!!! DISBitxh... 💯🔥🔥💯🔥💯
1:35
We need a 80s album Bruno
Te kierooooo demasiado
When Paak fell dead and popped up for his part💀😭😭
I need a cigarette now!🚬
Anderson  .Paak with that killer stomp 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾
ほんと最高！大好き！♡
BRUNO MARRS AND LENNY KRAVITZ SHOULD DO A DUET.
Bruno, I'll never have you smokin out window
Damn it’s so funny that they’re all holding a smoke. I keep on looking who’s going to take a hit. Hahahaha
Anderson Paak & Bruno Mars means Real R&B Music!❤️
hahaha goooood music :)
Lmfaoo paak on the floor
I think we can all agree music needs this duo rn 🙌
My favorite part is when they sing, "This bitch got me..." It cracks me up everytime I hear it! 😂
Go Guys !!
Anderson Paak passing out and playing dead then jumping up into the camera took me cleen out. I said before this is too crazy to make up. This actually happened to someone. I love the song and the lyrics. This is amazing.
Sounds like kayne wests gold diggers haha
I really think these two are the combination that the world never knew it needed.
Anderson Paak beings damn clown again  and it’s so sexy, i don’t understand. Like how am I sprung by his foolery every time? Out here trying to get a laugh and I’m sat here thinking nasty. Something not right about what he doing to me. I’m here for it tho. Give me more
Love the song except for B**ch part, disappointed in Bruno it totally ruined the vibe, he has always been such a classy guy and he could have so easily use Chick instead.
I like it.
Damn
where is Philip?
Вещь. Большой Привет вам Из России Товарищи Негры.

“Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids running round my whole crib like it's Chuck E. Cheese”😂😂😂 I love Bruno Mars the man is a genius, then “This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips” 😂😂😂
Well I am late yall!!!
Wow, wow, wow!!! All the hearts and flowers for this one. Sweet and funny
Bro's the one throwing the grenade now😆
Oh how I miss Phil…..  now those 2 were the bomb!!!!!   Talk about chemistry!!!!  This Anderson is cringe,  sorry Bruno, u could do better….  Either way I still love ya!
“This bitch got me paying her rent” 😭😭😂 Bruno with the cigarette will forever remind me of my 67 year old southern dad
Paak, silk sonic and bruno keep it up 👍 keep the fire burning to music
I'm here after everyone was saying he isn't gonna jump in front of a train anymore or he isn't calling all his lovelies anymore. He is furious with her.
Hoodville proud asf rn
Every song sounding exactly the same. This song wont get as much views because of that reason. Next single has to be different
Keep on bringing back the funk 👍😎

This is just too good. I can't help thinking of it as a skit from SNL. Too funny.
0:32 Anderson .Paak’s face, vocal delivery of “This Bitch” and the way the music dropped back in was so good!  I laughed so loud 🤣
Reminds me of Jackson 5
I don't even like bruno mars but this song is fuckin fire needed this song back in 2013
THIS BITCH. Is the funniest thing ever 😂
vercase on the floor meets locked out of heaven meets leave the door open
i got y’all w the lyrics:  [Intro: Bootsy Collins] Wait a minute, this love started out so tender and so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  [Verse 1: Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, & Both] Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah, woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  [Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars] This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak] Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  [Verse 2: Anderson .Paak] Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me, please (Help me, please, help me, please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  [Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars] This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak] Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could you do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (One things fasho, one things fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong to) Yeah, she belong to everybody That girl there, she belong to everybody  [Interlude: Anderson .Paak] (Oh, no) Look here, baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But, I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round bare foot in these streets Look out  [Bridge: Bruno Mars] Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now, I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  [Chorus: Bruno Mars] Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong) Yeah, she belong to everybody She belong to everybody Ooh  (got these lyrics off genius, idk if they’re wrong at all)

Anderson Paak come back was everything
Okay this duo is dynamic🔥🔥🐐🐐💪🏾
Words can't express how much this album is needed in this era..... Both of these 2 musicians have become the saviors to the R&B world......
HIT after HIT after HIT after HIT. Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars NEVER fail. They effortlessly brought back that 70s soul vibe but with a modern twist for today's audiences. PURE GENIUS! this is what is what REAL music should sound like and the legends that have passed from an era that's long gone, are definitely smiling down on them! Keep bringing that 🔥 🔥 🔥 Silk Sonic

Bruno only sing in boy bands now?
They had to have taken some inspiration from The Black Lady Sketch Show skit cause it fits too perfectly
I clicked bc saw Anderson.Paak. Isnt he the one who composed some of Twice songs on their new Album?
Music done right 👏
I love how they always throw a little comedy in the mix a long with that charm and smooth talk. 🤣😍
Guy look like Dave Chappelle...
Is this a real song or just some Saturday night skit? Cause this shit is funny as hell
Went from catching a grenade for ya to throwing that mf!!!!!
theres so many good albums that came out this year, this upcoming one is definitely gonna be the best one.
So he ain't catching a grenade now?
The story is hilarious 🤣🤣

Bruno Mars Neva Miss🐐HE THE GREATEST MUSICAL PERSON IN THIS WORLD 🌎 ❗️❗️❗️GREAT SONG
Such a fucken VIBE!!!
1:33
Are we still 90’s 😂😂🤪
I wish a women group respond to this song lol someone has to defend us women
Great song, Bruno got driiiiiip. But I'm not a fan of how this video feels like a blatant adverise for cigarettes
Anyone knows what happened to Phil Lawrence?
Somehow the lyrics weren't enough? Needed more "tobacco ad"
Marlboro advertisement
🌺🌺Giving them their flower 🌺 🌺 🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
This track is soulfood for the mind!
Good all Bruno he'll die for love and he'll drag a piano round then he sings the song whining about how he's having to pay for a woman. Buddy you have a very confused life mayby you should be smoking a whole pack looking out your window
Love Bruno's talent, but this song is nothing like the songs of the past that it's trying to portray. The Ojays, Temptations, Chi-Lites, and the Isley's are appalled I'm sure!
Best recovery song after listening to this https://youtu.be/wlqJNH81nUw 🔥🔥
this song slaps
The smoothest to ever do this music ❤️❤️💯
Love this and the alternative official video too!!!😂🤣😂 🤣
"can't believe it, i'm in disbelief." oh okay then got it
gaaaad i LOVE THIS jjajajajaja
that 'the feels' dance got me smoking out a chimney
Bruno I just wanna have your babies
0:32 Paak sounding like  something    Dave Chappelle  would say .🤣  They Smooth Af tho 🔥
LOL i love them and this song. every little detail, lyric, choreo, etc
" Now i gotta give you back (gotta give you back) to the city  " 😭
[intro: Bootsy Collins]  Wait a minute, this love started out so tender and so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  [Verse 1: Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, & Both] Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E.

(How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?)

"Smokin' Through The Window" by Silk Sonic & "Looking Through The Window" by Jackson 5... I'm starting to see a strong pattern right here in this video. Similar Music Videos Too.
Truly had me speechless
1.25 play song be great
I know the vibe is immaculate but let's talk about how Bruno takes the song home with his super vocals ❤
Dance moves are always on fire🤘🏻✨
I waz waiting for the notorious "she belongs to the streets" line, but in the end they said in the most lyrically genius way 😂
PLEASE!!!!! MISS JUST ONCE!!!!

Can’t stop watchinggggg 😩🔥🔥
This group, as much as they are new, are super iconic. Butterfly in my belly.
Suits and cigarettes flow looks like a copy The Weeknd's music videos
Although they have Bootsie Collins stars in the back I could totally see the OJays singing this. Andy is Eddie😂. This is sort of Used to be My Girl the update. That beat was happy as hell but the song was tragic than a mf. This song is suave and sexy meanwhile he telling everyone how he feel about yo trifling no good azz. 🤣🤣🤣
sheeeshhh
Yass
😚
Hercules !!! 👞👞👞
She Belong To The Streets
yall finally broke bruno.
This is the first time I heard a woman called a Bitch in a song and I died laughing.  Omg,  this was smooth and funny,  I am just imagining a dude smoking out the window after hearing her scream Hercules..🤣

Oh so when I say I WANT TO DIE and lie down in front my crush pretending to die it's "corny" and "blocking mall foot traffic" smh
How wonderful I'm crazy about this song
blast after blast... this collab is on different level
This so is Fire! I love it
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Ya she belong to everybody" went for the throat😭🤚🤚🤚
Bruno looks like some sleazy strip bar owner or porn theater owner from the late 70s or 80s 🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣. Giving Randy Watson and Sexual Chocolate a run for their money. Dude flopped onto the floor like a dead fish. 🤣😂😂🤣 . Takes notes youngstuhs. This was what we used to watch on variety shows back in the 70s. The Temptations, Smoky Robinson & The Miracles, The Four Tops, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, etc. All that choreographed signing. The New Edition and other groups used later when they came up.
wow, wow and wow these guys really knows how to pleased the audience
Lol ohh goodness this is funny and he dead on floor.. lol 😂
They went old school frl love the still and this song is truth these girls belongs to everyone 💯👌😅
Getting big little brother vibes. Especially their minstrels show album. It was just like this.
Musical Geniuses!
Bruno Mars; I texted her 5 minutes ago  Her: active 1 minute ago  5-1= 4 the streets
I wished they would've said CHICK instead of Bi#$h. Other than that I loved it. ❤️
Mixture of Michael Jackson and Elvis presley  styles
No one’s capturing the old school sound like these fellas right here. Gotta drop the album now lads, i need that.
Dhumrapan padega mehenga

This is FREAKING AMAZING!! ANOTHER MASTERPIECE!!!! 🎶🎶🌋💯
This type of music touches my soul 😂
LMBAO!!!!
Ah, que delícia de música, mas a letra é um tanto machista!  Ah, what a delight of music, but the lyrics are a bit sexist!
These young'ns are definitely on their r&b game!!!...I'm really feel'n the ol skoo flavor of their music as well as the real vocal talent!!!..very well done young bruhs!!!
How can someone wearing brown velvet be so cool and sexy ???😝
They incorporated their sources of inspiration from Bobby Womack, Earth Wind and Fire and many other legends in the past.
When he drops dead and stays there.. The best part of my entire life!

Moral of the story dont be a trick. How to not be a trick you ask. Don't give a female any money for any reason. Plain and simple. Her homegirl giving it up for free anyway.

The WAP got them stressed tf out! 😂😭 I swear I  ❤️this song ! This video is hilarious af , I can’t wait til the album drops Friday!! 🙌🏾
1:14 THIS PART IS JUST... PERFECTION.
Bruno “really” meant that!
So I grew up in the 90's and 90's music with great writing. So I struggle with some of this current music. But I also grew up listening to my parents music. So this is really that vibe. Anderson making me think about David Ruffin from  the Temptations. Anyways, I haven't been excited about hearing a new album since Robin Thicke 2006 album The Evolution of Robin Thicke. So thanks guys for giving me that feeding again. Excited!
Lo grammys van estar muy reñidos
No one going to say ,how Bruno look unhealthy

This!!!
Get rid of the cigarettes you ignorant and irresponsible fools - think of the kids that are watching!!!!

This and Freddie Gibbs got damn is the funny videos I've seen in a while.
Nigga get up off the damn ground fool🤣

That vibe is so smooth.
Toooooo funny🤣

The is the most beautiful, savage, troll song I have ever heard
Anderson .Paak lying on the floor dead got me dead🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:43 lo tomo literal
Bruno is no longer catching grenades or leaving the door open
I need the album to drop AND SOON.
Zarpaaaao brunito
Bruno always amazing but when A. Paak does his part. In my opinion just ruins the song for me...When he comes on ...''im like what the Paak no pun intended''.
To the 6.7k people who gave this a thumbs down Look Here  I Hope You Find Whatever It Is That You Need But I Also Hope That Your Triflin' @ss Is Walking Around Bare Foot In These Streets Look Out!
Hilarious!
Damn this is good shit, FUCK!
🗣 GRAMMY 🏆
Brilliant, absolutely brilliant! Thank you guys. I needed that smile!
I'm sure this Album along with Adele's and Kendrick's will surely be nominated for Album of the year come 2023 Grammys.
Linda canção !Amei. Estamos te esperando no Brasil.😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹
Tiffany who is It 😅🤌
These folks are absolutely geniuses and hilarious. Love the song and the vibes.

INCREÍBLE TE AMO BRUNO

You are so Great Bruno Mars
This B---- really? Same word someone use on their mother they be ready to tear them apart. Clean the lyrics up and sell the message.
YES PAK
I'm so lucky I'm alive hearing this music
The cigarettes add a special flair because it’s like talking to a guy on the street telling a story 😂
I love this whole vibe !!
Had my attention until she became a “bitch:” -/ Black men must get better.
Yessir this one for the fellas hoes can go back to they block now
Pure Talent here folks!
A reminder the God loves you and Jesus died for your sins. 💓💓
A song is good when you can listen to this constantly and not even skip it one second this is definitely addicting I have listen to this like 10 times to 20 times every single day there’s something about this song 50 years from now I’m gonna still be playing it
This is a masterpiece 🔥💯❤️
Cadê os brasileiros vendo esse vídeo, curti aí 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Does brunos part kinda remind anyone of the chorus if Digging on you by TLC?
When is the album coming already???!!!!!!!😍😍😍
Bruno Mars vocals are insane!
Bruno-i would like to dedicated this song to young couples and their ex's 😂
Um comentário brasileiro, não se esqueçam de mim, aaahh.

Bruno Mars is indeed a GOAT!! Never fails with his good music all the time!!
Good👍🏼
This shit is lit 🔥 they got it bro, they can hate on these guys but let’s be real they talented like shit. This shit got me saying, this B got me paying the rent lmao 🤣 in tears 😭 🤣

IT'S THE PRE-HOOK FOR ME 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love this
Put this on 0.75x
I wonder if his gf had been listening to this song too much https://youtu.be/LFyISFLXneI 😂
He really went from catching a grenade to throwing it back 💣
I spit my juice out when his verse dropped 😂😂
Soo good
Simply amazing!
No hablo inglés, nisiquiera entiendo la letra de la canción, pero la música no se trata de eso, se trata de sonidos, vibras y sentimientos.  ¡ESO ES LO MEJOR! 👌
Hahaha I love everything about this song and video
The weeknd is Better than u
Him on the floor took me out!! 😭😭😭😭😭
🎵 Anybody pick up a little "Prince" vibe?🎶
Imagine getting called a community b*tch in song form
Really Thank you SO MUCH Bruno And Anderson !!!!!!
Instead of cutting the song off at 3:12 they should've brought Kendrick in around 3:40 after a 30 second transition. He would sound incredible on this and I would love to hear what story he would tell.
I just love their vibe 🤩🥰
I like that song and video
Dammit these brothers make me wanna grab a Newport and smoke out the window!! 💨💨💨
bruno aging backwards
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Smooooooooth & Silk haha
Not me learning this in one hour

Love this duo ❤
They honestly put so much passion into this I love it ❤
Gonna need the clean version of this fast guys!  How bout:  This "Girls got me".... etc.  Bitch ruins the song for sure.
this is my favorite thing ever
Did Bruno get stuck in the 70s ?
😂😂😂😂seeing Anderson Paak on the floor playing dead and then the pop up had me dying⚰️ Hope this song makes it into the classics section🥰
Let's hope we don't bring Glamorizing Cigarettes back.. They could use a Disclaimer in the beginning -but that would sooo ruin the vibe..
This is hot as hell!! It's officially every baby daddy theme song now lol.
Oh my my my!!!
Ésta canción con Mariah Carey 💐😍
More lyric
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHY BRUNO IS NOT ONLY THE BEST VOCALIST AND DANCER BUT HIS PERFORMANCES ARE SOO GENUINE? I cried a little at the end. Him and Anderson Pak are everything. Love them.
I love this seems like every song that has been made by Bruno Mars and Anderson Park is awesome 👍🏽

…….they way he holdin the cigarette you can tell bruno stressed.
Mannn these guys on to something 🔥🔥 good music at its finest
😍😍😍😍👑👑👑👑
So good, all of it
the cigar made this song better ❤️‍🔥
Dame hope my neighbour's  gonna like this song ❤️
Could Bruno Play Sammy Davis Jr if they ever make a movie about him?
i aint gonna lie, bruno really saved anderson paak's whole career !!
All I know I'm tryna go to the show
Literally Silk Sonic is the pure representation of an 70s-80s band group that time travelled in this year LMAO!
idk this makes me so damn happy as a black person.
This song funny af 💀
My manz is STRESSED
Smokin babyyyy💨
Herculeeeessss
Motown  style forever ❤️❤️❤️
"look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need, but I also hope that your trifiling ass is walking barefoot in the streets" Literally killed me like that was it I just couldn't contain my laughter anymore and jsut spit everywhere on accident
Bruno done threw the grenade back
come here cuz Joy recommends  me this song n I love the vibe😎😎
Lovin' deeply Anderson Pack!!! You both are amazing, all in the video is just brilliant!! Just the best !!!
This is Entertainment ! We've come a long way. They kept the soul formula ALIVE ! She belong to everybody (?) That is so sad , even tho it is a jam.
Y'all... dat B**** belongs to the skreets!!! Why was he laying on the floor... bwaaaa ha haaaaa haaaa🤣🤣🤣I love it!!!
NEW FAVORITE SONG
How can anyone give this track a thumbs down? This song is Fire!!!!!
just perfect old school back love it !!!!
Prolly one of the hardest songs to end the year no cap 😂😂😂😂
the dancing is soo smooothhhh
Omg....I freaking love it!!!!
As much as Silk Sonic's tunes are honey to my ears.  The smoking and cigarettes are definetly SAD and poor choice. What person wants to make out with another person who smells and tasts like an ashtray. FOUL! As much as the 70's was cool and all, Wake up Silk Sonic you an't in the 70's nomore! and that one thing from the 70's no one wants back!
We ain't call the Kids and accept as  We as Bitches, and never bad kids!!! Still love y'all any way. Love Y'all Bruno and ALL Y'all FOR EVER LOVES❤️❤️❤️
*Damn*
I loved every bit of this. Now excuse me while I replay this.
that delfonics intro.
SUPER COOL
SOOOO many people can relate to having to go to your car and "vent"! GREAT wordplay!
Nah this really gave
3 for 3 for the Best freakin Musical Duo ever!! Another Dope hit!! 🔥🔥🔥
This song I lit
I would die if they sang Return of the Mac 🤘💞
Top top top !!!!!!!!!!!!!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
Hilarious and smooth!
The lyrics are hilarious. And the music is smooth like chocolate mousse. What a great song! This is brilliant. I love them!
Red pill music.
Damn who hurt you damnnnnn
This song is going to be on repeat & dedicated to alot of women.
Good to see a familiar face again… the classic voice we missed 😩
The start of the song kinda sounded like Justin Timberlake skit on SnL
Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic IS SUCH A GOOD COMBINATION, GREAT WORK
Supreme. Soulful. Real music. Feeling like McDonald’s….I’m Loving It!
😍❤️💯
The red stars are a problem. Communism must be resisted, and any pure source of socialism must also be resisted. A firm foundation of capitalism is the only way forward.
damn🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
the album didn't even come out yet and it's already the aoty
Anderson del minuto 1:36 al 1:50 tipo Herida pero jamás derrotada. 😂❤️
0:57 , 2:01 , 2:54  Oh I thought that girl belonged to only me, but I was wrong cause she belong to everybody🎤🎶    1:16 ^ Just the other night she was gripping on me tight screaming Hercules👏🏼Hercules👏🏼Hercules🎤🎶
SIMP Anthem 😂😂😂😂
The drama, the performance, everything. I hope the album tells a story through all these little numbers.
100% garbage disgusting and sad... nothing cool about taking in carbon dioxide during a covid pandemic which attacks lung receptors 🧐😱😭
Glad they are bringing back the Old School sound... Bands are everything!!! 🖤🖤🖤
Will this get radio play ?
Is that how americans hold cigarette?
Been listening to Anderson Paak since he was in No Worries, every colab hes in is A Masterpiece
A classic from back in the day topping the charts even now  (-_^ )
Damn this shit is LIVE!!!!! Can’t wait until the album drops!!!
Lmao!! I thought someone edited that shot of Anderson laying on the floor I didn't think it was actually in the music video. XD
poor role models with cigarettes
Is Bruno Mars black, Hispanic or white. He sure sings like a brother, though. I love all  of his  singles
Bruno so cool 😎😎😎😎
THAT WAS HOT !!!!
Amooo
I LOVE THIS!!!!
Daaaaaaauuummm...
This proof we need bands again
Takes me back to Oran "Juice" Jones song/video "The Rain".
Try look that cool while singing with your vape kids.
This made me laugh hysterically for 20 minutes…!!
This.is.pure.gold.W.O.W
Love bruno's look. Looking like that low key uncle who leads a double life as a drug kingpin lol
Sheesh Bruno......Be killin it with these jams. They be vibinnnnnnn
🔥🔥🔥- no words.
Aí simmmmmmm e musicaaaaa 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
why this sounds like it’s already a classic?
aaaaa i love you
If you paying child support that “this bitch got me paying her rent, paying for trips...” part hit different. You feel that shit in your soul.
LMAO i love these two so much
Hahaha nice rhythm, very good harmony and blending of voicess
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️♥️
Been on repeat for a whole day now. I can’t get enough
This is top tier entertainment
That moment when Bruno and Anderson sat in the studio and said "How can we make a banger out of the phrase 'She belongs to the streets?'".
😍
Wow! Another song to add to the collection of greats.
Absolutely adore how they are bringing back the 60's and 70's R & B vibe. The dance routines, the clothes everything.
I was cheesin so big through this entire song...Paak laying on the floor was sending me lmaooo
Is this hilarious or is it me?
I love it!!!
Bruno only releases diamonds!
This is 😎
very nice
Individually two great artist but together these dudes are special. This song is so dope! 🔥
That’s Folks is about as close to perfect as you are gonna get!!! They knocked it out of the park in so many categories!!! Too much to list!!!! One of the best musical collabes Ever!!!!
One of the greatest collaborations EVER!! Love it!!! 🚬🚬🚬🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The dislikes come from the women that got em smokin out the window 😂
Y de verdad se murió 🤣🤣🤣
Mada bem! Manda muito!
They might as well being a group or something
potang inaa naman bruno mars hahaha Idol
Not that man actually dying 😭😭🤚🤚
Não precisa nem o vídeo começar para dar like porque já sei que a música vai ser maravilhosa :D
This is criminally underviewed
Woooow i love old school …you remember me boyz 2 men days
This song demands a response song.  But, there are no female artist with the chops to take it on.
No more grenades
Magnifique Amazing Beautiful soooooooooo great job men ❤️❤️❤️🧡❤️🧡❤️🧡💕💕🧡❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🔥🥰🥰🧡🧡❤️🤩🤩🤩🧡🧡🥰🥰🔥🧡❤️👌👌👌👌❤️👌👌👌🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
how can two humans be so perfect?
Isso tá tão perfeito
I don't know why I feel like I should be high listening to this.  "Skate" was cool but this is another "door open" moment right here! These two is up in the kitchen cooking up that good ole soul food! Shit be tasty. Can't  wait for the whole meal called the album!
Never forget Anderson Paak said he fucked a flesh light on his XXL freestyle.
That was so fine.
Give her back to the city Bruno.
break bruno mars heart again
Forget the streets she’s going back to the city 😂🤣😂🤣
Me encanta me encanta me encanta!!!!! que gran equipo✨ soy adicta a sus canciones 🎶 😎👌
I wish they toned the lyrics down a bit and left out the word ass and bitch. But, other than that, this is the sound in Music we need. Some Soul brother No.1!
Cingaru da carcer
great song
This is music !
Always bringing tears to my eyes 🥲😭
This will be a classic
I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THIS MAJESTY.
Oh no! 🤣
Loooooove Bruno
I think Bruno Mars is the only mainstream musician that the music  I can enjoy
That’s what they get for leaving that dame door open
I’m grateful for this type of music 20 years from now I’m going to remember this and it will be a classic 💯
sexist
"OOOH NOOO" "WHOAA WHOAA" Never heard this said so masterfully
Grown folks music!! 🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔥🔥🔥🔥
That's Bootsy talking in the beginning.  He's a Legend & gave them the name Silk Sonic.  Another hit!  Bruno's vocals esp. his falsetto....wow! Anderson falling out & that slow knee drop is on point! Hercules Hercules is from Eddie Murphy Nutty Professor 2. Is the drummer Bruno's brother?
I remember when I use to do that at home. For sure mum and dad knew lol/
Feminists have just found their new anthem !
Some chick got our boy Bruno fucked up 😂
wtf is that first line?
Bruno said that "This. BITCH!" like he been holdin' on to this shit since Natalie.
This is so good
So, it's the 70's again.  I like this.
Bruno got that Michael Jackson vibe. Take that crown bro!!!
THE CAMP is giving me LIFE
Are they're  wearing  VELVET PLUSH.  Bringing  back the Seventy
I don't like the woman being called a B.  I love Bruno and the group, but I am really sad they made a song that addresses a woman that way.  I know I'm in the minority, but it's just the way I feel.
Yo this shit 🔥 🔥
I wonder if this is the same girl he wrote treasure for? This music video reminds me of the one from treasure😂😭
Fantastic, back to the 70 'with a beautiful song from today🤗🤗🤗
Nice bass
soo good for festive season 😅 it has a vibe
bringin Herka-leez back
lmao dead at paak on the floor. Facts!
Bringing back old school music and I’m all hear for it 🙌🏾✨
Bruno Mars en el Show de las estrellas, falta Jorge varón dándole la paradita en el trasero de la buena suerte. Jajaja

This is a publicity for cigarette manufacturers
Show 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Why not do a collab with Filipino artists? Gary V, Daniel Padilla, Morisette Amon or Regine V? Just saying.
When Anderson popped back up after being dead for 30 seconds 🤣🤣🤣
I like the way Anderson lifts the microphone off the ground a little when he's down.
All the New songs singing about simpin- Just came here from Tpain's "Cool with that" Simpin aint easy
i wish Prince could watch this
1:18 🤯
This is bomb! I mean for a guy band!! Bruno supersedes all his limits; brilliant Bruno and band!
KILLING THE GAME!!! 70/80s vibes is back

Old Bruno Mars "I'll catch a grenade for you" New Bruno Mars " This B**** got me paying her rent, paying for trips, diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist"

Probably that broke up cuz she didn't take Bruno/Anderson in Leave the Door Open
Wait A Minute This Love Started Out So Timid And So Sweet But Now She Got Me Smoking Out The Window  [Verse 1: Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, & Both] Must've Spent Thirty Five Forty Five Thousand Up In Tiffany's (Oh!

Andre3000 needs to be on the remix

Now they just need a song with akeem ali to complete the cypher
No way you can't see Michael Jackson's influence on it.
😂❤
Never misses
Not Chuck E Cheese at the crib 😅😅
so 14mill+ views so far, 'b' word is somehow ok.. and we expect kids in school not to say it.. Good luck America 🇺🇸 on your next generations~
I'm so done with yall lol 😭😭😭
This is a mood boys
Esses cara faz um trabalho tão incrivel
ALways just amazing
i was really hoping they said she belongs to the streets but still amazing
Just as expected to my childhood favorite singer 😏
💪👏👏👏👏
yo these niggas are smoooovvveeee
The audio engineers and videographers need to be recognized. For everything they have done so far.
I love this. I can always count on Bruno to bring back old time music.
Great. And more Funky oh yes!
I played this video over and over yesterday coz the song was so addicting, and how come only now then i realised one of the singers was lying down on the floor for.... At least 5 second? 🤣
Bruno can get it
GENIUS!!!! Love this damn song and it’s funny as hell
I LOVE the ✨smoothness✨ of this song
lord have Merty, everyone in this video are smoking.....lol in every way possible
Perfect💕💕💕😍
I’m saying when Bruno done making music I need some movies he is hilarious 😂😂😂🤣🤣
I guess simps now have an official anthem for when they go try and get their girl back.
He died. 🤣😂🤣 this is insanely good.
What in The Kevin Samuels Theme song shit is this ???!!! 😂😂🤣🤣🤣😫😫😫  Y’all Killing it
3min and 20 sec of protection .... 🔥🔥🔥👏
Message taken because i hope  yall understanding this song......    Hard!!!!!!!!
i think that you love me, 3:00
🔥🔥🔥🔥
YAAASS
Y'all never disappoint 🤣😂🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dude went from "cathing a grande for you" to "this bitch got me payin her rent"
i love this vibe and this typa music so good
So good!!!!
Pho tha streets anthem!
Lol.. this is so good
The part that killed me “ I hope your trifling a** walks barefoot on these streets”😂😂
Still patiently waiting for the album to drop...😑Bruno and Anderson's chemistry is what I live for:-D
amo
I have some years on Bruno, but he can get it…lol!!!  This was slick as hell…they killed it all the way around!  Love the song, choreo, outfits and all!  Such a talent!
"I'll pick up these broken pieces if that'll make you mine"
Y les quedó gustando

I love it ❤️
Why this feel like parody song? 🤣
DJ Khalid voice #another#1
Who in the HELL disliked this song?! It’s 🔥🔥🔥…
This is based on a true story and many of us have lived through it. Know your worth Kings.
🤗🤗🤗🤗
Man they aint missed yet this album bout to be 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When I look at Bruno I see everything about MICHAEL Jackson... he is so talented and musically and entertaining oriented
This Nigga reviving is hilarious
All the dislikes on this come from the girls who belong to the streets...they just telling the truth about y'all
I think the funniest part of this to me is that they be writing these songs and yet both of them are in committed relationships hahah! Like Anderson's married and Bruno might as well be married considering him and Jessica have been together for over a decade! Like what u boys know about these women
Nah he damn threw the grenade back. 💀
I LOVE ITTT...THEY SAY...THIS BIT-CHHHHH😂😂😂😂
I love this dude! I need the album already!🤣
Silk Sonic just raising the level of today's music for all other musical acts to follow.
1:51 I can't stop laughing 😂

GOOD GOT DAMN!!
Big brother Burno! Tell the people who did it!

Criminal.
Can't go wrong with Bruno and Anderson. Nothing but LOVE!!!!!!
"BRUNO MARS IS THE FUCKING TRUE" 🤗
Anderson .Paak 01:35 Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die 01:44 *plays dead on the floor*  01:52 sike!

Y'all did it again. Love it!!!
OMFG. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 So frickin amazing
1:36 😭🥵🥵
Fellas they out here staking advantage of us. We need this I can relate to this bullshit. My anthem 2021 barefoot hashtag
Bruno Mars + Anderson .Paak = The fabolous twins 👏👏
Smokin Out The Window is testimony of heartbreak of a man.💔 See this will go over some people's heads. Becuz they are portraying that as well paying homage to the groups of this era who had over the top dramatics in their performances on stage to bring their performance to life and make women swoon. We ain't got NOTHING like that anymore! Man people don't even slow dance anymore, they don't really dance, (not footwork either) the music taught people how to move and dance. The music today doesn't make us dance. We NEED MUSIC like this again. And how FUN is this video?!! 😂🥰You TRULY feel Andy heartbreak and him and Bruno are PISSED how this woman played them both. 😂 Andy is testifying! And guess what? Men cry too. They go thru heartache when they really feelin a woman. Especially if she plays him, and yes women like this! Alot of them, as a black woman I'm saying this. They are for the streets. 🤷🏽 She belongs to everybody.  So they are straight serving on this song. And this isn't the first song to talk about a woman's cheating golddigger ways
Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak collaboration is the best thing that happened this year.
They found a magic formula ✨
he aint black...WHO CARES ...SIT LISTEN AND JUST LUV THE MUSIC
Loved it 🔥 🔥 🔥❤❤❤❤❤
I'm loving Bruno's Kizaru look lol. IYKYK
Silk Sonic will be album of the year when it finally drops.
Instance Classic!!!
LOLthat fool passed out LOL. These two......This B*tch got me pay'n her rent ....Hahahahahaaaa
I want to sing this so bad but if my girl hear me singing this then it'll be my last day.
I keep it on repeat, I'm buying!
🎶🎶🎶🔥🔥👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
GOD BLESS YOU ALL
Euuu aammmmmmmmeeeeeeiiiiiiiii!
Yo they had fun on the shoot 😂.  This bitch. 😂.
I came for 00:32
Tha shyyyyt
Nice callback to The Nutty Professor. Hercules! Hercules!
Omg so good!

❤️❤️❤️
Lord I love this video, from the facial expression when calling her a bish to anderson fell out...just love this..this collab was what the music industry needed....yall single handedly gave a cpr breath to r & b period.....
this the best one out of em all so far, my type right here
Is this song sexist? We going around calling women bitches now?
Fam this is Jackson 5 "looking through the window".
They did it again y’all 🥂
He sounds so done with this bullshit lmfaaaooo
How is it so goooood!
This is a great job of "OLD SCHOOL !" They did THAT ! LOL ! This is the "FORMULA ! "I can't seem to pull away from this video. And the subject matter was so dark. She belong to everybody (?) How sad is that ? But you still can't help but fall in love with this new"HOT OFF THE PRESS" song.
Simply STELLAR  Every Lyric said and the whole Story Line of the entire song simply Amazing, the acting out the emotional parts Krazy when Anderson Dropped on the Floor as Dead I'm done such a Class act and the Suits are From the 70'S YES They did that
This is a fucking masterpiece
Smoking  hurts.
This song holds a meaning relevant to the change that needs coming with men. 🤙
Still no Vinyl-edition in sight ...
"stache? B_____ word? Smokin'? This retro or something, like 60's ish? Not cool. Not funny. Sorry B Mars cuz I really like you.
The transitions between Bruno and Anderson are flawless 😂. From disbelief to dis bitch 😂😂👏🏼
I love the song..............
This dude just lost 1/2 of his fans as girls
Te amo meu amooooooooooor, Bruno <3
Jackson 5 ! lol
Guess she left her door open too...
The question is how many grammies can they get?
Now imagine they gave r Kelly a verse ….
Back to 1970
damn man they so smooth, music is back again
Dang... She belonged to the streets
When did lebron James learn how to sing
Gosh... Why I had a laughflash after Anderson was laying on the ground 🤦🏻‍♀️😂😂😂 Music makes sense again ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Instant  Classic.
Ma di cosa stiamo parlando
Este tipo, puede sacar temas cada siglos y va a seguir haciendo música hermosa
He went from leaving the door open to smoking out the window what's next, eating by the fridge?
Which one of yall pissed Bruno off
Caraio ❤
Heard this on Spotify without the video ... wasn't hitting the same till I saw this music video ... now I got it on replay lol
I bet no woman understand the meaning of video and sounds
they still together in one song.
Lol HERCULES👏🏽 HERCULES👏🏽 HERCULES 👏🏽 only real ones will get that reference 😂😂😂
Video hits different at 360p
Anderson Paak looking like David Ruffin😂
This is a whole vibe.
Every woman has to read the lyrics because i am sure that all of your Gürls out here didn't understand who they are all talking to.
BaeBEE ♥️🥰🙌🏽♥️
Eu amo essa essência do clássico, perfeitos!
Bruno Mars ain't catching anymore grenades for ya ladies...
Amor da minha vida 😍😍😍
Obrigado por você existir Bruno Mars 😍😍😍❤️
So fire https://youtu.be/X3PxPzWzQTc 🔥

This comment is simply to say I love this song very much. Thank you and continue with your day
I just love everything about Silk Sonic
출근길에 손가락춤추면서 걷고있는 나를 발견하다.. 이미중독...
🥰🙋🇧🇷🇧🇷
Fucking hell I enjoyed this 😂😂💯
They're putting some Old School FUNK on this! omg I'm in love with this album!
Mmm The Whispers style, love it!
I f**k with this it's funny asf too
It makes me smile that this is slightly choreographed!!
I enjoyed watching the whole band. I  smiled all the way through the video. Listening to the lyrics and the vocals OMG beautifully talented and creative.
Progress is the b word in mainstream music.
Ayo this song about me and my exes I swear but the video kills me every ti- 💀 Time🤣
They’ve mastered making hits...now it’s time to try comedy😂😂😂 Couldn’t stop laughing thru the entire video 🤣🤣🤣
Fire
Qui obra de arte, MUITO BOM
When is the next song? 😅
JUST DROP THE ALBUM😡
"She belong to the streets" -Bruno Mars 11.5.2021
She won't be walking barefoot in the streets in a long ,long time, you spent 45 grands on her at Tiffany's ,she has diamonds on her necks and her wrists, and what's even worse she belonged to others too, meaning  others spent their $$ too. She gonna be fine
https://youtu.be/yhlYhRkzASY  SLOWED VERSION
https://youtube.com/channel/UCgTN7L5_JcDoRlCnYwSPjGg
this is gonna be a fortnite dance
Bruno looks a little like Sammy Davis JR☺
When a discord mod buys her onlyfans
“ This BITCH” 😂
I really hope this influences future artists and becomes the new trend
The sound of this drum kit is SO good.
1:36
Bruno channeling Sammy Davis Jr with that ciggy
This iconic video/song It's going to age well..ooh and it's already started
These guys are funny.🤣🤣🤣🤣
Song is soooo good omg
Anderson ❤️
Is this a clown SHOW? these people  will  never take the place of the greats Jimi Hendrix  ,MJ AND  Prince , Temptations & the Dells  never  not in a million  years  sorry  yall , but it's the truth, why do they have  cigarettes  (posion) in their hands , just asking  !! And they didn't have to use derogatory words like  B#$^h so sad where they are TRYING  to take our beautiful  BLACK  music  not gonna  work  tho !!
This might be one of the best songs I've heard in my life
EVERY TIME I HEAR THIS SONG I LIKE IT EVEN MORE!!!!!
the way ya turn a Future album cut and and twist it into 90s Soul Train jam is just legendary
Bruno Mars smoking on that cigar and getting right back to the mic is out of this world.....
Love the soul influence and its pretty damn funny😭
Anderson Paak and Bruno bring out each other's shine so so much
O.M.G. yes babyyyy🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amo♥️
Holy shit 👻💫🌍
You betta sang!🎤
These guys deserve so many fuckin’ awards. They keep releasing hits! Not one of their 3 songs disappoints.
0:31 my favorite
In the words of Future "She belings to the streets" 🔥🔥
I love the part  "This bitch got me paying her rent"
They found a genre they loved and now they just F-kng around with it ! And I’m here for it 😂😂😂
I felt this 🌬🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾  except I'm singing "this boy got me 🎶🎵🎶🎵 "   Much peace to all. Stay up. Stay blessed ☯️👑🙌🏾🕉🤗💕👑
This is refreshing in a sea of horrid rap "music ".
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this song and video is so dope!
these new tobacco ads are getting good
Bro future is crying right now 😂
1:36  The way Bruno Mars says “THIS BITCH” had me rolling! 😂😂😂
This performance is absolutely perfect. Love it!
Is the time-down-the road-she-got-red-flags follow-up to Leave the Door Open?😆😆
this song and video is hilarious 😂😂😂
Stop calling women bitches.
Nice! The one dude at the back dancing ..... look like Kevin Hart
Way too funny, loved it
Love this duo and the wholeeeeeee collaboration great music !
Why do I want Dean on the feature of this 😂👏
Bruno throwing back the grenads😂😂
Yes yes yes 👍
I'm gonna need more songs like this🤣❤
yesss best single
They made a classy way of saying “she belongs to the streets” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Got her bad ass kids running round my whole cribb like it's Chucky Cheese. WoooW! Nooo! 👀😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
"Let's popularize ciggies again." - Nobody.
Hilarious!
This is anthem for 2021 males
They at it again! Can't stop listening to this!❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Now I gotta give u back to the city"
Sammy Davis Jr is alive and well.😳
Is this the result of leaving the door open
Muito bom, adoro suas músicas!. (very good, I love your songs!. Brazil)
Me : Baby don't call me Zaddy anymore call me "Hercules" Her : Huh??
Bruno not simping no more😂
Bruno definitely threw the grenade back at her
Haha this is awesome and hilariously groovy in the best ways xD  Gives me amazing summer vibes, windy breeze, that everything's alright kinda feeling, with a tinge of sass and realism and real world things thrown in there haha
i'm here for 1:36 😭😭
It's so addictive. Honest question: did a big tobacco paid for it?
Love they giving homage to (looking like) David Ruffin
MALISIMO!!!!!!!!
First 25 sec I was sold lol this a HIT!
BRUNO ME ATROPELA 😫😫😫
This is classic fire 🚦🚦🚦🚦🚦
Ma che bellaaaaaa
Bruno is such a stoner with the way he holds that cig 👀
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!!!
The fact it’s called smoking out the window kills me how relatable 🤣  (Paying for the trip part LMFAO)
Reminds me of the Motown days!
I’m just waiting for the album to drop now 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They mind as well stay together as a group they a vibe n I’m not even a fan of them
Bruno mars has  ever had a weak album ever.....that's crazy to me
When a Filipino and Korean make music together. Its just magic
This is amazing.
🤤
A BOP
Hilarious 😂 I love ❤️ this sh!+🤣🤣🎃
This so dramatic!! I can't, hahahah. Love it!!
Cigarette in the hand the entire video...gotta respect that
Silk sonic you did it again
This so good lol
I want a cigarette to play with now
I Love Love Love Bruno Mars 🤩🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥He So Lit And Groovy
Hit
https://youtu.be/9SDIdI2oXSw
This is a Golden music video. Top Tier!
How come Anderson Pakk looks like Dave Chappele. 🤣
Absolutely love these guys!! Bringing soul music back thank you silk sonic!!!
Definitely they wanna go with the mood/lyrics, but would be great if they had used less/no cigarette in the video. Being the celebrity, they can inspire so many people for good or bad things, and smoking is definitely not a good thing for your health. No offense to the people who smoke. #NoSmoking #BeHealthy
Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LOL, Anderson turned into Morris Day at 2:22
Oh I’m dying! I freaking love these guys and how much fun they are having making great music! Keep it up y’all😁
Great musicians 🤩
Say mane this song and video is jamming and Bruno with how he's holding that cigarette has tickled the hell outta me LMAO!
lights stars like sharpey evans
This song has a negative message...the music has a romantic undertone but the lyrics are incongruous with the sound.  Sorry, love you Bruno but this one is being given a failing grade
"I hope you're trifling ass is walking around barefoot in these streets" Is a different level of hate and mockery 🤣
😂🤣😂😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣.... this made my day i laughed so hard
I haven't laughed this hard at a music video since Learn To Fly, and haven't LOVED a song this much since...ever
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is funny but it's the jam!!!
These folk ignant.  I love it!
this is the best yet
What a Perfection!
Gods plan
I died when Anderson suddenly went back up to sing his part after lying on the ground playing dead. 💀💀💀
1:51 made me lol
Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah, woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me, please (Help me, please, help me, please) Baby, why you doin' this?

Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (One things fasho, one things fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong to) Yeah, she belong to everybody That girl there, she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here, baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But, I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round bare foot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now, I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong) Yeah, she belong to everybody She belong to everybody Ooh
Este Bruno hace musica con la zurda!! Que bueno es!!
Silk sonic is the perfect duo. They even have perfect back up singers. Shout out to those wonderful gentlement behind bruno and anderson. 🙆‍♂️

SHE FOR THE STREETS!!!! lol Love this video!
Notorious satanist.. Wake up.... Especially give no time or money to the Whoredashian clan. #canceltravisscott
At 2:08 Andy is singing his heart out! Like I genuinely felt sorry for his situation 😂
Eh bruno mars got way better songs than this. I didnt even like leave the door open i warmed up to it. I like it now. But this one just nope im cool.
Love them. Love this ! When he fell out cold on the floor almost busted a gut laughing! Can't wait for the Album!
turn on 144p and watch it in 4:3 aspect ratio
Dat boy is goood!
1:27 lol
This feels like a SNL sketch.
Ok..this tune got 13 million views.  That tells me it's time to bring back Motown.  Let's hope we get a hit per week like we did in 70's.
Wait a minute, is Bruno Mars slowly traveling back in time and taking us with him? Everytime I watch his new music video I swear....
I really like Bruno Mars and his band, impeccable!
QUE CHILO EREEEES 😁💕💕💕
Who are the people who dislike this?
I didn't expect the lyrics. They've got me laughing so hard 🤣
i like this song
This is epic!😄
This will ring off at so many events for so many years to come.
Love how he pops up after dying, lol.
best thing thats happened to music in a long time! and the fun it brings with it!
So we gon act like they weren't low key Milly Rocking in the beginning? 🤣🤣
Help Anderson he has fallen and can't get up, he needs more funk
Sounds like a Raphael Saadiqe track...  on Viagra!
:)))
🤣🤣😂😂😂 LOVE IT. A FUNNY "somebody done somebody wrong"  song!! When you leave the door open you get kids running through like it Chuck E. Cheese 😂😂🤣🤣
It's the "Dis Bitch got me paying her rent"  for me 😆
Haha...I freaking love the retro Motown look..😊
Good old days where you can smoke inside and talk shit with the OG's about your marriage then go back home to a meal.
Love it what a class act so enjoyable to listen and watch !
This Bi+*# got me payin her Rent.. smart word picking.. it's be Sexy word.. Good Job for Silk Sonic..
This is a well-made music video!! Anderson laying on the floor is hella funny. It has a Missy Elliott type music video-type feel to it!!!!
Stylish
This-bitch-got me Paying her rent 😂😂😂🤷🏽‍♂️favorite part
When the boys get together and decide to get down on the vocals
I don't like the old school Bruno mars...
This shit is hilarious and a groove!
I love you guys awesome as always...
Bruno went from catching grenades for these women too this..........Smoking Out The Window because of  the stress 🤣🤣🤣🤣😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
She belongs to the Streets is a Rough Translation.
Ciggies, yuck!
I think that they did a decent job of sampling "Never Can Say Goodbye by Jackson 5". I was like I think I have heard of this beat somewhere before..... They brought back that old Motown sound.
Iala o clipe foi patrocinado pela Marlboro! Hahahhahhaha
They made an album, during the pandemic. Look at what they've given us 100 percent . This ain't easy.  God bless the entire group.  Thanks for y'alls effort. Love this song
"This bitch".... HOLD UP... I'M that bitch🤣🤣🤣 sorry bruh... not sorry
When Anderson Paak leans in and sing "This B got me..." I FELL OUT!! It's my first time hearing this song and seeing the video too.  So, I wasn't ready at all!!  Bruno and Anderson are AMAZING alone and TOGETHER...just off the meter 💣💣
Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, COPD, heart disease and emphysema among black Americans. This song is tone deaf to all that is harming minorities in the U.S.
Best song I've heard all year!
This is type 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like it if you censor the “ B “ word.
wow!!! fucking wow!!! Epic!!
looks like they left the door open for the wrong woman.....
凯子之歌 哈哈哈
"This Bitch..." never sounded so sexy before...
Engravide minha irmã Alex Caceres da musica 😎👊
Lo mejor es una perfección
Hu
This is fire 🔥🔥🔥
Can we just appreciate the choreographic comedy genius of the line “got her bad ass kids running round my whole crib like it’s Chuck E. Cheese” -perfectly choreographed with the George Jefferson half-bow /smirk.  Perfection!
I had quit smoking for almost 4 months. I smoked 2 cigs while watching this video and remembering my ex aka "THIS BITCH!" #ThanksSilkSonic. 🤣
Interesting song
Superb! And what a great tribute to the Pips.
class, just class
14 MILLONES GOOOO
Putting it out there soon my team and I would work with silk sonic 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 love this song

If your struggling with anything please comment what you need to break free from , I love you guys, through this screen i pray you you will finally see that God is actually the one you need , you’ve been hearing it your whole life , but wait until you actually step foot into his presence you will change forever knowing what God has placed you here for, do you know how special you are?? You are beyond better than what you feel, there is always light at the end of every dark tunnel. If you read till here I promise you God wants you now, open you bible
Marlboro ads it's on a new whole level on 2021
Smoking causes cancer.   Also bad smells for other people too :)
Probably wishing they hadn't left that door open.
"bad a$$ kids runn'in around my crib like it's Chucky Cheeze" LOL. "Bi**h got me pay'in her rent..." Brilliant!!!
Love It!
Keep your mumble rap...we got another solid gold classic. 🥰
I thought Leave the Door Open was amazing but they did it again and brought the same feeling back, you two deserve Grammy’s that say Album of the year, artist of the year and more period hands down.
Holy cow! Now I'm looking forward to the album superbly and painfully hard. 🔥🔥😪😅💎. Fire song.
Smooth
How is it possible to dislike this idu
Can't get enough . Don't want the vibe to stop😌
Wow!!!! Wow!!! Wow!!! Amazing!!!!
😎
listening to this beautiful jam in the jungle of democratic republic of the congo
THIS, BITCH, GOT ME PAYIN HER RENT, PAYIN FOR TRIPS!
This is def a bop when you speed it up to 1.25 speed lmao...try it out
If "don't miss" were people
Finally something for the fellas let's go
Pure vibes. 2021 Old scholz❤️
Two things that kept running through my mind:  OMG, they're on carpet with lit cigarettes, and I wonder how many times they got static electricity shocks.
I'm feeling the drip of their suits🥺🥺
We needed this
with time bruno mars starts to look like sammy davis Jr
Hey Bruno , be my sugar daddy 😭….. worth the try 😂
omg
It's hurts that gurl belongs to everybody...
Bruno so mad he had to point his cigarrette !!!
Funny how no one talks about how this video is a hell of a trigger for all smokers!
https://youtu.be/dtdXC7AOBt8
this is pure comedy 🤣 untill now every song is amazing and special I can't wait for the album
If I love Paak one more time... the emphasis of “this bitch” Bruno behave
These two are perfect musicians for each other. Great music
Loveeee this song love u Bruno♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Although I'm young as a lover of old school soul from being raised on it. I friggin love joints like this. Simply perfect
Hahaha this song blows my mind Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak in the same song.. Paak was just the right type of crazy to make this totally work
Bruno went from give you everything to not giving a dame
Nobody: Literally nobody: Anderson Paak: "Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die."  **Dies**
Bruno on that cocaine diet
Amazing !
Not only is this a sheer display of talent and art but it's a beautiful tribute/ parody to 70s soul bands 🤣. lol this is 🔥🔥
Mega!!!!
someone please send this record to will smith.   He out here looking stupid
Love this song
Jesus loves you ❤ 🤍
This song lit
Wow! Its so beautiful 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Love it love it!!!’
1967 Temptations redux.
Este tema va quedar en la HISTORIA!! OMG que bueno es!!
When there is a Beyonce, there is a Bruno Mars.
I wonder if he talking about the same girl he catching a grenade for🤔
Bootsy Collins sent us a blessing.
i want to be “this bitch”
Damn… why do I feel guilty lol my ass is single! I am in love with someone I will probably never get to touch 😭 I love this song though! I’ve listened to it a lot
”This BITCH” Bruno threw the grenade back😂
2021 belongs to these dudes.  They are dropping hit after hit.
Issa no for me guess u have to go thru that type of foolishness to really feel it 😩😩👉💯
my OCD kicking in hoping cigarettes ash isn't getting all over that carpet
You could tell they made this entire album high  and it's not to be taken too seriously. The music and production are quality but the lyrics are lighthearted, almost bordering on absurd. Still, Leave the Door Open is my jam!
FINALLY ! A song for the good men that has been done dirty by a street walker. 👊🏾👑🍺🍺🍺🔥🔥🔥
I’m planning on getting my payback on this in Milwaukee July 19th, 2023. Would love for you guys to be able to play this with me! Let me know if you can. I’ll be releasing my first album on that day as well!
Why do I like this ?????
Good tune but I hate the cigarette, it brings death to the vivid song. Feels like a Marlboro promoted song.
A tradução da letra para português é podre hahahahahahah, mas a melodia e a batida são perfeitas
🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅 love it
It's 2021 and Anderson Paak is still calling women bitches so gracefully
they did it again!!!!!! sheeshhhhhhhhhh
😂😂 omg i cant stop laughing, I heard the song a day or two ago but the video is icing on top. perfect duo.
Great vibe
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Bravo...this song got me screaming "Hercules" 3x with a clap... love it.
Perfeito com sempre!!!!!!!
Relaxing !
He said he got to give her back to the city. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
THIS THE JAM TO CLOSE THE YEAR OUT!! #CITYBOYZ #CITYBOYZ2022
OMG I love them! Im up here Cackling right now  LOL!
Bruno’s Falsetto is Heaven ☺️✨🥰 SilkSonic is Bringing the Soul Music of the ‘60’s & ‘70’s to 2021 ~ I ain’t mad ✨🤌🏾
😂😂😂😂
Nobody:  Me at 3a looking at my girl: 🗣 THIS!! BITCH!! 🥴🥴🥴
Whyyyyt!l he play dead like that 😂😂😂😂
Anderson Park laid out on the floor 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

This look like the beginning of a  Docufilm and I would watch.
How do you get 13millon views in 3 days with less than 1 million likes 🤔 these numbers ain't adding up.
this shit gives me chills. their chemistry is just so perfect, and every single aspect of this song is perfectly executed. the composition is just unreal. masterful work.
Bruno ils back Et 24magic brrrrrr
Marik es SilkSonic en el Show de las Estrellas :v
What a smooth, sexy and hilarious way to tell a chic you don't want her no more, because she has community, state, nation and worldwide vjj!!! AP's death scene while everybody else kept singing was too funny!!! CTFUL 🤣😭😂😁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Classic hit 😂frfr
perfection !!!
GOT ME PAYING HER RENT
Ok at this point Im sure Bruno can sing about any theme and it will be a sexy hit. Heres a idea: Lipstick on my toilet paper.
I'm glad to say I was listening to anderson paak more than a decade ago when he was breezy love joy
кринж. отстой. дизлайк.

TI AMO TI AMO TI AMO
Ok this song and video has put me in the BEST mood EVER!!!!
Not Hercules!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Geeez!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 “Dis bitch..!” 😂
I love them as a group... I can listen to them all day.
Clearly, these cats hung around their daddies, uncles, and cousins...who likely grew up in the 60's and 70's and are now blending that olk skool R&B with the present,  Keep keeping it real and keep it coming fellas...love it!
This record lit . Kids these days won’t understand
You could have use the word chick not Bitch.  If you wanted to show class.
"Not to be dramatic"  Anderson : continues to dramatically lay on the floor just to jump back up and continue singing 😂😭😂💔💕
Another claassic
Bruno is a musical genius.  He collaborates with some amazing artists! And his videos are so fun to watch.  You can’t help but smile as they act out their lyrics.  Love them.
Please perform at every Super Bowl(r) halftime show forever! The absolute best performances come from these gentlemen!
life lesson on how to say she a hoe back in 80s
Bruno/Paak on BEAST MODE. #EPIC
Kings who hurt yall
this man went from "i will take a grenade for yaAAaaAA..." to 1:36
"This Bitch!" Pretty much sums it up.
Can’t stop listening yoooo
I coughed 3 times watching the video 🤣🙃🚭
When he went road kill on stage I died with him...lort y...🤣🤣🤣
Paak just laying there
😂😂😂😂I’m here for it and so nostalgic ❤️🔥

I love it❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jesus Christ, isso aqui é bom pra carai viado
Very smooth. Love it! 🔥
the choreography, the fashion, so so good. but the lyrics had me on the floor. they crazy.
Anderson .Paak playing dead on the ground is a mood
Bruno Mars's music is a hot frying pan and I'm on it chocolate.
I don't know why but something about hearing bruno singing the Pre-Chorus had me rollin. So much force behind bitch. 🤣🤣🤣
Зачем сигареты в клипе, если сюжет снят только на сцене?
Monstros Sagrados da Musica Mundial
Love it we need this 🔥🔥🙌🏽
Great sound! 😜😜😜
Dayummm brunoo this is heat brother😭🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯‼️‼️‼️

How can a song sound so melodic but yes so aggressive
Surprised they can get away these lyrics in 2021. Very good song though.
Another banger
😂🤣😂🤣These brothers here!
I can not wait to see them reinvent this live 😍
♡
smh Do they think people are too dumb to realize that this is just leave the door open again ???  I cant be the only smart person out here can I ? Its the same freaking song I got ears .
Lls okay I like  it👍
Hilariously deep lyrics😍😂 Anderson playing dead is my fav part🙌 😂🤣
I do , though, love the suits

Acertou mais uma vez.
I really felt when he saying paying the Bills, got diamond necklaces and bracelets for her and yet he still alone.
Talented visionaries🔥🔥🔥! Not every artist can do what these two are doing. They're the ones you just credit with entertainer title!
Bruno Mars is brilliant I love this new song it's got the 80's vibes :D
Bruno keeps stepping back in time!!!!! ❤️
Repent and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ
Modern deflonics
The lean into the camera with the "THIS. BITCH. GOT ME." is it for me.
It seems like Future wrote the Text for them 😂🤔this will be his new anthem #shebelongstothestreets
Nice cigarette commercial
Again! These boys having toooooooo much fun!!!
Nada nuevo, ni desde lo musical, el cigarillo un prop malisimo. Me cabe Anderson Paak, pero la de esta bitch me tiene comprandole cosas.. aghgghhhh que ella pertenece a todos, que onda con este tema?
Anderson Paak got that Bobby Womack vibe!
Somebody got Bruno all the way fucked up. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tuff 2mas🔥🎧🇻🇺
Anderson Paak got that Bobby Womack vibe!
All the feels!!!
Love from Burundi-ngozi

This song is everything. The vocalssssss. I literally have no words.
Music from SATIN? YES!!! REPENT!!!
I lost my mind at him just laying there on the floor until it was his turn to sing again 😭😭😭
Lol You too play too much 🤪😜🤪
When my guy was on the floor, I was done!!
It's so refreshing, because you can tell that they are genuinely having a really good time. Making music they love, no gimmick or trying.. just pure talent.
How could anyone thumbs down this joint?
Musical soulmates 🔥🔥🔥
Omg the lyrics so 😂😂😂😂😂
The one song Weird Al might not need to bother making a parody for.
This right here... THIS RIGHT thIs RIGHT HEREEEEE HERE IS WHAT MUSIC IS.... THIS IS WHAT HAS BEEN MISSING!
Musical soulmates 🔥🔥🔥
I needed that laugh just now!!!! When that camera panned out & Anderson was still on the floor I almost spit my drink out 😂😂😂😂
Is it me or Anderson .paak looks like *ANNOYING ORANGE* ???😅
🤣 I love it
Damn Boosty Collins the real 🐐 behind this album!!
Love your music Bruno Mars♥️
This shit groovy as hell
I thought bruno would catch a grenade for you. Lol
so sexy

The Jacksons vibe
I literally have not listened to the radio in more than six years and I hear this on a TikTok and was immediately enamored after viewing the video.  This Jawn brought me back to music.
this song is sooo addicting wtf they bodied this
The lifetime story of a sugar daddy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can someone cover this but a male version? Cause I’ve been the one smokin out the window, paying players bills! Love you guys long time ❤️
Its funny and fire rolled into one. The moves were slick
Yo you could tell dem nigguhs meant that shit
a trip to the seventies
That man hit the ground and just popped back up when he felt like it.
Lolol I love it
So the real R & B is back then?
Anderson. paak laying there then appears out of nowhere I love  how Bruno Mar lets silk Sonic & Anderson. Paak  get their in shine too. Some just take the spotlight light cause of who they are I love you Bruno
I love this!!! I hope Jay is on the remix of this song!!!!!!!
Greatest link up of the 21 century
Can they drop the album soon so my life can be complete 😂
It's rare to see something original done with music anymore, yet it has a classic feel to it at the same time.
Up Brasil
I can't stand not nan one of them. LOL
Lol it’s get up for me
The "B" word totally Unnecessary!
Silk Sonic and Adele for artists of the year ! I will watch & dig these modern, throwback, funny masterpieces for the rest of my life !!!
Love it
Copia triste de Michael Jackson 😑🤢
This shit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hilarious!!
Keep rocking on Bruno Mars 😀
I’m loving the Mars & Paak combo these two should have been working together a long time ago
Wow
is it me or do anybody else hear never can say goodbye when listening to this
motown motown motiown ...terribleeeeeee
Vooov perfect i love brunooo🥰
The vibe is on point ALL the time…
The video is definitely giving
I love anything Bruno Mars does.
Someone got Bruno fucked up lol
I'm a fan 🔥
We need a whole album of them together
Never disappoints 😭
1:07 I'm convinced they were tempted to say "she belongs to the streets" but than thought that was probably too much😅
Bruno is getting boring. That music was already done in the past. Move on Bruno.
I grew up without a Father. So many walk that same path of life, never knowing the TRUE guidance a Father can provide, the sense of protection, the unwavering love a Father is supposed to extend to his children.  It only got harder once I had children of my own, HOW do I be a Father, when I don’t even know what it means…so many abandon their children asking that same question to themselves.  God changed everything, God began showing me what it meant to love, to care, to nurture…but not just my children, but those around me “thy neighbor”.  I realized I knew no Father, just so I could come to know THE FATHER, when the time was right 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽  We are going to have “Moments of Uncertainty”  But that is not as important as the element you use to relieve yourself. Many followers of Christ are still indulging in our vices and addictions to relieve our “Uncertainties”  Lean on God in your darkest moments, lean on the word that says you were created with meaning and purpose, lean on the Grace of God…let it steady your mind, your heart and your body.  I don’t know who I’m writing to, who’s reading this, but God is ready, and waiting for you to seek him, through Jesus Christ, whom he sent to die the death meant for you and I.  Not just on Sunday, not just when you “need” him, not just when you’re desperate…but every day, hour, minute and second of your life.  Develop consistency in Christ, and you will come to know what it means to “Be still, and know, that he is God”  Glory be to God 🩸🩸🩸  If I still have you here, God bless you, join me as I take you inside a moment of my own personal “Uncertainty” in life, while never forgetting God has me always 🙏🏽🕊  https://youtu.be/VXfWQtxnwqc
OMG.... I love every song Bruno put out. could listen all day to his videos <3
bruno mars dont miss
The Young Generation is killing it🤣
Nossa isto e cultura de verdade 🥰meus tipanos estao explodindo👏 eterna musica excelente e qualidade 😍
Mano do céu! Bom demais!
“Now I gotta give you back to the city”  Is just a smooth way to say  “She belong to the streets”
I love this song so much.
Bumping this right niooow
I love this .. omg🔥🔥❤❤
when you are having fun and at the same time showing all the god given talent that you have is what silk sonic is everytime they are performing
Bringing back MoTown! I can't decide if this reminds more of The Temptations, The Four Tops, K.C. and The Sunshine Band, or Kool and the Gang. Or maybe some combination  but I love it!
THIS IS FUCKING MUSIC 🔥
another Addicting Song that im gonna replay
Wow. Another fantastic performance from Bruno Mars and the gang!
OMG real honest to goodness 🎶 music.
🔥🔥🤣❤love these two
It's a beautiful song
Sou Biutiful
💙🔆🏹
Chuck E. Cheese!!

Get the Grammy ready for duo song of the year.
💖💖💖💖💖
as much as i want to appreciate the song and the vocals, the lyrics are cracking me up. and when anderson paak was on the floor, i just lost it, man 😂😂😂
1:33 💀💀💀
SHE BELONGS TO DA STREETS‼️😭
EU AMO VOCÊS! ❤️🇧🇷
this is dark and funny at the same time. hearing at 1.2x speed.
Me: a proud simp also me when this song comes on: "THIS BITCH GOT ME PAYING HER RENT PAYING FOR TRIP"
THIS IS PURE COMEDY!!!! AND THE FACT THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY SING IS THE HUGE PLUS
Bruno went from leaving the door open to changing the damn locks 😭
Bro lemme just stop singing because my teacher and classmates giving me weird stares ☠️
Drop the album already man
Check out the choreography at 0:42 when their foot movement matches the snare drum, thats minding the details. Bruno sets his feet at the same time when the one snare hits, the backup guys time both feet differently. Love this
I can literally smell the cigaratte smokes while listening to this. lol
I swear bruno, paak and silk sonic are the best thing that's ever happened to me this year
Man I love these two 😭💜😍😍😍😍😍. Anderson laying on the floor 😭😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣👩‍🦯👩‍🦯👩‍🦯Best part for me. The way he said bitch I was not ready 😂🤣😭😭😭😭
They got me dying laughing and grooving along to this song all at the same damn time. I love it!! 😆😆😆🔥🔥🔥
Which genre of music is this? It just speaks to my heart, I’m in heaven since “leave the door open” ❤️❤️
"This BITCH" 😂😂
Man, hit after hit after hit. The album, when it comes out, is gonna be selling like fire.
Love it 😂😂😂😂
I guess Bruno ain’t catching anymore Grenades 😂
😂😂😂😂This music video is beautiful... Their voices are soo soothing but their lyrics are just cracking me up.. Their funny
What genre of music is this? It just speaks to my heart, I’m in heaven since “leave the door open” ❤️❤️
Uptown funk is best of bruno
This is another hit when the album drops music is gonna changed forever 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ooooo my God! this sound lit, yeah🔥🔥🔥🔥🥩🥩🥩🥩
This is the greatest synergy in music history. Every single is a banger so far, makes me want to get into the studio and start recording music even if I can't sing for nothing.   Top top music, getting me jumped up every time I listen to it.
This song is for my Bitch Golddigger of a girlfriend, hope she come across  this song. Awesome video 🔥
Awesome song loved it ❤️❤️
1:37 they got Bruno Mars fucked up 😂
Anyone know where I can find music similar to this type of music when he starts singing diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist.
More like... midget Mars.
"Smokin Out The Window"  Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (whoa) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this?" I thought that girl belonged to only me (One thing's fo' sho', one thing's fo' sho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody Yes, she belong to everybody Everybody That girl, yeah she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How) "How could she do this to me?" (How could you, how could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong (She belong) To everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody) Everybody, ooh (Yeah, she belong to everybody)

Hi 🙋🏻‍♂️ Bruno. Your voice is super good. Smoking 🚬 is bad for your voice hehe 😜
This is a pairing that came outta nowhere but these two are magical together.
Perfection.
the cd gotta be good I bet !! such a vibe!! love it
I love this song so much!
brooo. if "she belongs to the streets" was a fkn song :O
I LOVE LOVE LOVE YOUUU😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I LOVED IT SO MUCH 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Omg!! How slowly he “died” and how quickly he “came back to life” 💀😂🤦‍♀️❤️ The genius comedy only works because of how wonderfully talented they are. It wouldn’t work if the song was trash. I absolutely love them together
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
matando 🔥
😂🤣😂Love it! #ThisBihh
For the few of us that love this music, simple hook , simple video with no thick women needed or whips to get our attention.    Just plan old real music.
https://youtu.be/Vt5nQfJ76CU
Bruno Mars and Silk Sonic the last breed bringing real RnB home💯
🤣. IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC THEY CALL THOSE MEN … BOBOS 🙃 .    ALOT OF THEM IN NYC 🤦‍♀️.    Great song .. it’s a pitty it’s not in Spanish .. a lot of BOBOS can relate to it .
I can’t wait to see them do this live! I have a feeling more high notes will be added and they will do something that just blows the original out the water! Bruno has a knack for that and adding Anderson has been the best thing music has need for a long while!
Pedazo de dúo! Me encantan son fantásticos
My man’s no longer catching grenades for bitches hes throwing em at them
(Joke) You know that Scrappy Doo has been found Dead in Miami copypasta? This reminds me of that
dami nanaman mabubuntis.
Hercules Hercules 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🤣🤣
A romperla como siempre alo BrunoMars!!
Best music of the year
🤣🤣🤣🤣 yooo I was not expecting this at all 😭😭👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥
after "skating" for some time, now they realize they've been used :(
The rebirth of old school, on steroids!
Tout simplement parfait ❤️❤️❤️
i will never get over this . ever .
I Love that song   Sing it too Bruno Mars
yesterday i watched the movie ’God of Love‘
I love everything about this ❤
música boa mds
Nobody else noticed bootsy at the start????
maaannnn i am so done with Bruno and 'nem!!!😅🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅
I am so happy to be born during the age of this music. It’s so good 😭 😭 😭
Not screaming Hercules! 😆
This Bxtch 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Dancing with a cigarette, now I have seen it all.
I don't like when the singer calls his woman a "Bitch" I think it is totally sexist and I am not into that stuff ... Bruno Mars is not himself anymore ... I cant watch their pretentious manner ... annoying performance ...
Love it
TALENT!!!
Lmao😂😂😂
So...I've heard this song several times over. Why am I just realizing they're saying she's for the streets?! 😂
Honestly the world needed this music for a LONG time. Real music that hits your soul hard. Thank you Bruno and Anderson. Bravo 👏👏👏
time to put bruno mars in the hof
Magic.
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die."
Wow
They making R&B great again!!
I’m sorry but Bruno is too good to be in a band or be someone’s sidekick or back vocalist 💔
This is too good it can't be real. Thank you Dre. For real.
These brothers are so talented.  I won't take that from then.Funny song n video.  But nobody I know bumps Bruno Mars in the car. Nobody. Its too old skool for me. I'd wish he wasn't so stuck in the 70s.  It's overkill with every single. We get it bro you're different
Everybody deserves an award for this video and the song. 🎙🎤
Missing Jackson 5
Best April Fools music video ever
Wooooow dancing and laughing my ass at the same time ! … new emotion stored!
Bruno channeling Sammy Davis Jr.
😍🥵💋
70s vibe. Love it.
2 things: 1. Bruno Mars leans in with the "can't believe this" look on his face after the "kids running around here, like it's Chuck E. Cheese" line; 2. There's a "dead" body laying on the stage, while everybody else continues with the song and smooth choreography and smiles in their faces, like "there's nothing to worry about; this happens all the time; he'll be ok, soon enough"! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😅😂🤣🤯 But the thing is that this smooth song and delivery tricked me! I had to re-listen to the song to finally get it, and I've been laughing ever since! Lol Thank you, #silksonic SN: I was thinking that this was a fake out video that was a precursor to the real video and song or that it was going to switch out to different scenes with a woman and her kids, and then end with Anderson sitting on a window ledge with a sad look on his face, literally smoking out of his window! 🤦🏾‍♀️ This works, between the stage and stylized look of a time period that can be felt in the smooth sound and musicality 👍🏽👍🏽
You are the one who left the DOOR OPEN, remember???....stop complaining eish!! 🙂
The scene at 1:20 is fire
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Perfect!
That drop dead 💀 😂
ABSOLUTE GENIUSES. I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!
I been saying since Bruno came out. Bruno is the goat no question.  His soul and flavor is uncanny.
Wow. I love it right away. First time listening to this.

For Indians : Smoking is injurious to health

This album will win about 15 grammys!!!
Those red lights effect in the bg is  just 🔥🔥🔥🔥....hats off to the production team.

This is one of the best music videos I have ever seen.
The duo we didn’t know we needed ❤️❤️
SIMPLY BOSS,,,, WOW !!!!
Now they need a remix with slim thug, young buck or trick daddy
Damn, paul pierce can sing
I’m way too into the smooth dance moves to really focus on the comedy.
Bruno Mars the goat!

.............To deceivers, enemies of Christ 😡😤A fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.😡😤 Jer 15:14
Damn what can I say BM you are the best of the best😜
God treats everyone on the same basis. 35 Those who fear Him and do what is right are acceptable to Him, no matter what race they belong to. Acts13:41 Look, you Scoffers! Be astonished and die! For what I am doing today is something that you will not believe, even when someone explains it to you! So that all the world may be saved. God punishes them, because what can be known about God is plain to them, for God Himself made it plain.20 Ever since God created the world, His invisible qualities, both His eternal power and His divine nature, have been clearly seen; they are perceived in the things that God has made. For God will reward each of us according to what we have done.
❤️❤️❤️The Beautiful Wife💓💓 . . The head of Jesus is God the Father, the head of man is Jesus Christ, the head of woman is men. When Jesus Christ is the head of the husband his wife shall reverence him and her husband shall praise and honor her ❤💃... It is written. . She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and deliver-eth girdles onto the merchants. 25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. 26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. 27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. 28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. 29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellent them all. 30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 31 Give her of the fruits of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates. ~Proverbs 31:24 By Kings with LOVE~
“Being humble does not mean that you are depressed, but that you are humbling yourself for the sake of others. You reduce yourself from your original position just to bless somebody else. That’s not easy, when the flesh is full of pride, because pride desires promotion, to be seen, and to show off. Humility is the opposite. Humility teaches you to voluntarily abase yourself.” ~David E. Taylor~  “...he that shall humble himself shall be exalted” (Matthew 23:12)
Most relationships don't last as long as the cigarettes in this video 😩😆😆😍😍
( If you can get offended, you can be a traitor.)  Jesus says, If you have ought against your brother go to him and him alone.  Jesus says, If you are offended by your brother go to him and him alone.  You got to get to the point where nothing can offend you. If nothing can offend you, you can't betray.  https://youtu.be/348i6U0LLLo
These Men are dramatic🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anderson Paak on the floor for so long and then popping up so quick got me DEAD 🤣🤣🤣
That man died and come back alive mid song 😂😂!!  #EPIC
This is what we need more of musically. Relatable and well-crafted art.
Wondering if this is on Bezos' playlist after what happened at the art gala in Los Angeles ...
Silky smooth 🧡
I love everything going on in here
Go bless Silk Sonic... I have no other words.   Love, from South Africa. ❤️
This a mf banger!!! Glad I got that old school in my blood , poppa taught me right! 💯💯
Caras canta demais, guys single a lot.
Waiting for this album is going to be the longest 4 days of my life.
You should have had Joints instead of Cigarettes 🤣
not sure but I think she belongs to the streets
same shit as the other song...door open...
The carpeting budget on the set
Loooooove this!!
Lmmfaoooooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh my  God... This is a classic. Silk Sonic does it again.. You cats are awesome. LOVE IT>>>>
So iconic
"I'm in DISBElief... THIS BItch..."  the play with phonemas are so subtle but so pleasant omg
We needed this
god damn 🥶🥶🥶
😂😂😂
Giving me vice city vibez...
This is the WHOLE vibe💛✨
Love them EXCEPT the smoking is SO GROSS!
The amount of times I’ve replayed this video and song is unhealthy
Man this group is smoother than honey
Lost all respect with me using the “B” word…smh.  The song still could have been classy and soulful without such harsh profanity.
This is pure and utter ART.
Maybe that punk think he's black
I holla every time he jumps up
parecen sus voces a los bee gees
He sang his verse and then died cuz he sicka these heaux...on Gawd, I love Black People 😂😂😂😂
Bruno snapped that "This bitch" from him had so much feeling. He let out all pent up "This Bitch" moment he had
Love it!!!!
These boys out here starting fires 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Time to throw that grenade back
This is legendary
Love it!!
damn they driving up cig prices again smh
I listened to this song all day on Saturday 😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I love it!
Give them their Grammys now!! Best group of the year!! 😊❤️❤️❤️☺️
Meraviglioso pezzo
THANKS BRUNO MARS! YOU'RE  THE BEST
and this is just the beginning!
This song is so incredible 😭
The way he popped back up😂😂
Lol I'm here for comments.. 😂🤣 Andersons playing dead... So much drama 🎭....
Bruno remind me of Sammy Davis jr
This is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen or heard.
Smoooooooooooooth!
Youtube should remove the dislike button for this one! it is absolute perfection 👍🏽
Luv it
Whoever gave this a thumbs down is just miserable! 🔥🔥🔥
master piece I die
Smooth & HOT!! Who else heard it the 1st time and kept it on repeat!! Loving the surprise & entertainment the duo makes!
Didn't know this genre could expand into comedy, but yet, they did it! 😂
Like si recordaste a Bobby Womak  ❤️
2021 💥
I just love bruno.....
like will be given.
The song is 🔥. The video does me in every time!
me gusta me encantan XD
Micheal jackson would've been impressed
Aaaaand another one
😂😂 Anderson smoothe with it lmao this b#$ch got me paying her rent and that oh no at the beginning
There are lots  of singer that's going to jump on the band wagon with more with more old school ballad, I thought alot more people would be on the bandwagon with Tyrese because Tyrese is a great old school vibe. It not any no one great music. Rappers need to go sit somewhere because I never listen to their music anyway. Tupac music was something I listen to but not in the beginning until he made changes to his song, like mommy, California/ few other he made But MJ will always be the best out there. These are my feeling. I want judge you so don't judge me, for my opinion. Keep up the  good work Bruno/Paak.
More of these, please.
If I’d say Im in love with Anderson and I will live with him happily ever after I think my boyfriend would be okay with it.
Love it!!!!!
Nah….this the one right here!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Cliche but, we've been blessed. They are so good at telling stories through their music.
Bruno 😍😍😍😍
Why Am I 3 Dayz Late For This! SMH, The Shame.
Que vaina tan buena ese grupo y bruno lo máximo
Quanto tempo não vejo uma música com qualidade sendo produzida. Verdadeira obra de arte Brasil agradece, esplêndido!
Love this😁😁
Top 10 of the World's Funniest One Liners   1. IRS: We've got what it takes to take what you have got. 2. I'm out of bed and dressed. What more do you want? 3. We have enough youth.

Stay  fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will  die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's  true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus  said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed  adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you  have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are  a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three  of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be  innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in  Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven.  He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward  us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then  rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to  all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ.  Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21  for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you  read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
how could a mortal man write 3 bangers songs in a row
2:36 Nicest way to say "she belongs to the streets"
“when a simp wakes up from a trance these goes hot him in”

He said, “Look baby I hope you find whatever it is that you need, but I also hope yo triflin ass is walkin round here barefoot in these streets”. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 The music, the comedy and the choreography is such a vibe. The playing dead took me out.
This was everything
Nice Jam, it would be perfect if there were no cursing 🤬, can't listen to it with my kids or my parents around...what a waste 🤦🏾
I love you, a very sexy tune ❤️❤️❤️🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
I haven't heard such a good music for a long time
ICONS!!! So groovy!!!!
I can’t 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Old school\new school .I'm a grandma and this story is the same. The years have changed to protect the innocent😎
Is this a song dedicated to The Juice? 🤣
Goddammit Bruno Mars and Anderson paak u motherfuckers blessed my ears for the 3rd TIME THIS ALBUM IS GOING TO BE HEATT
Rumor has it that this song was dedicated to Will Smith
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes With TRUE MUSSICIANS GIVE THE DRUMMER SOME GIVE THE LEAD GUITARIST SOME GIVE THE BASE GUITARIST SOME 🥰 ♥️
guess I’m the only one crying at the perfection here.
:D
This my shit
🥰
If he said belong to the streets I would have lost it
This is GOLD you guys!!! Pure perfection on repeat!
When Anderson comes into the first frame with "this b*tch  got me paying her rent" I about died right there 😂
It’s the way Bruno holds his cigarette for me lmfao! This is amazing and these two and are KILLING the game! Ps. Anderson is a whole fool & I love it!😆😆  (also the background dancers were gettin it lol)
I love this song😍
Bruno can do no wrong 😭🥰
Will Smith probably got this on repeat🤣😭

Mannnnn bring this style into the world againnnn🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Imagine how it is hard singing while smoking in the window..
The dance moves are so on point..
I love they are bringing back the R&B I grew up on.
Swear y'all never miss
Silky song. My only reservation is that they making it look like you can smoke AND STILL sing like that. You can't. You cannot.
If you don’t like video you clearly don’t have a sense of humor! This is the best video of the year in 2021.
Ngl that "disbelief" into "this bitch" transition was soo hard and unexpected, with the camerawork as well
He said give yo ass back to the CITY not the STREETS 😫🤣😫🤣i love bruno smh lol
the video is killing me !!!!!! he just stayed on the floor ...dEAD
que gran dupla!
If "She Belongs To The Streets" was a musical
So many can relate. #classic #soul 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥love it
"Rip anderson paak 1986 - 202-wha?, hes still alive, oh okay nvm"
God damn, y'all did it again.
This is awesome! Love the humor!! Anderson is something else! Great job guys!!
Smooth as butter 🧈
I posted a Lewis Capaldi cover, maybe you want to check it out 😄
You just know these guys be dying laughing throughout the making of this
adik2x na ug dagway!!!!sad!
This is crazy, can't hardly wait for the  full album
Who in the hell broke Bruno’s heart? Cause when he said “this b***h” he sung it like he meant that 💩 😂
Salam dari binjai'👊
The way Anderson got back up 😂😂😂😂
The are always on point. It's so satisfying watching any performance of them.
I know it’s worth the wait 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
This is just a funny way of saying She belongs to the streets 😂😂😂
the smoothest way of saying " she belongs to the streets "
This beettcchh
This feels old and new at the same time
I didn't seen anyone smoke :))
The cigarettes gotta go. So stupid.
Can we get alternate versions of these videos. One with this old school soul music vibe and one that depicts the stories being conveyed in the video........Example: showing them in scenarios dealing with girl that's for everybody and when they realized it.
The way Anderson Paak smokes is just "Legendary" 🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Manda hi Brazil
minnnnnnndd blowwwwwwwwwwwn
Nice song, yes am feeling it ooh sshhiitt. Ok ok know he gone away gone away, a new papa gonna be smoking out the window no doubt, the what a around the way girl is about, so another will pray the bills, keep me lace, now its written all over his face his face.

Best duo ever. Also, best breakup song a man ever sang in this generation.
Best song of 2021.

Ayeee! This song is everything! The instruments, the background singers, the lead lyrics…like man! Five stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
art 🤩😍
Nice
Well this song’s real name should be “the consequences of dating a gold digger “
This song gives the vibe in that one Victorious EP where they hire Cat and Robbie to sing messages to people cause it sounds better than saying it directly
I swear. I just love love love this song ❤️❤️❤️
Nah cuz ik the dance now 😭
This pandemic got me inside the house, but a Silk Sonic concert would get me coordinating my mask and outfit for real!
Um sonho realizado, ver um projeto desses!!!
Gently song sing for gold diggers 🥲🥲
Damn Wanna smoke? Here in L. A.
Loving the 70s Blues with a 2021 mix. This song lyrics are 🔥🔥
Old school vibes!  😉😘
DARN

You can't tell me that dude behind Bruno is not Kevin Hart. :P
Shouldn't have left the door open guys!
11/12/21 magical date and number… for the world will finally get the silk sonic album 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽   3/3 🔥🔥🔥
Giving me Temptations vibes
Song of the year
the only left now is feature with the  greatest philosopher of our time...you know the name.... SIR FUTURE NEVADIUS HENDRICKS
i’m obsessed 😭 such a vibe !
It is what it is...🔥
Man I was so high and all the verses hit so hard at the right moment... Thank you Bruno Mars for existing and bringing that silk smooth voice to us. Now I just gonna get smokin' out the window and singing how could he do this to me 😎
genialidad tiooooooooooooooo
Bruno did a little falsetto notes at the end, maybe they should've collaborated with El Debarge to assist with those. I could just imagine extended falsettos from El... 😍
"Not to be dramatic"  bruh 🤣
Man, I love Bruno and Silk together. Banger after banger!
I can not wait to see them in concert! 🔥🔥🔥
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
I guess you don't have a balcony.
Is that the Jackson 5 never say goodbye sample? If so no wonder its a vibe!
Hehe
The year is 2030. Bruno Mars and AP took an ambitious project on many years ago and have completed their masterpiece of an album with music videos for every song.
These two are dangerous together!!! classic!
This what multi diamond records sounds like. Bruno Mars really the goat
Би деген просто кайфқой
Anderson giving Bobby Womack vibes 😂
Once the album drops, I think it'd be so damn awesome if Bruno and Anderson will do a Carpool Karaoke with James Corden.
Classics being made right before our eyes
Do not smoke ...Smoking is harmful to health... Have a great day  ; )
🔥🔥🔥
It's pretty obvious Anderson never held a cigarette in his life. Good on him.
Hi have a great day
This guy is a G coz he just enjoys what he does... that simple. He would do it just to do it
awesome
This video is about to reinvigorate the cigarette market.
Everyone who dislikes this is haters😩 this is one of the best 🎶🔥🔥
Hercules Hercules...
I like how this is basically "she belongs to the streets" that was made into a song
Did Anderson just die?!??🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂
Hey Bruno......You are killing me man with each cancion y video que haces parcero!!!! Well done .Paak!!!! It is like travelling back on time to the golden 70s and 80s and bringing back great melodies and performances like Jackson 5, Bee Gees, Marvin Gaye, Barbra Streisand, you name it compadre. FELICIDADES POR ESTE GRAN ALBUM...
Anderson and Bruno just keeping winning and winning with their fantastic smooth music
Smooth 😍
This is superb, all I can say is thank you so much for this song <3
the weeknd and bruno saving music
If this ain't Stone Oceans outro I'm gonna be mad af
The philosophy of the rich and the poor is this:The rich invest their money and spend what is left. The poor spend their money and invest what is left ✔👍

DAMN!!! LOVE THAT VIBES!! Soooo smooth!🤩😍😭
So dope ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

amo vcs lindos
Anderson .Paak is funny as hell 😂
Bruno Mars caleño
Subscribe to Anderson Paak's channel
Very similar to , I'ma keep the door open. Although still vibing with it.. but expected something a lil different
awesome!
These dudes on a whole other level
This is diffidently reaching number 1 on the billboard hot 100
The dislikes are from people who prefer to have their door closed and locked
this sounds more like a snl sketch than a song
I can already feel that Anderson playing dead will be a meme.
Amazing 👑's 💣💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Man the 12th needs to hurry up and get here. Every thing they dropped has been fire!
This song is no Island Boy but its aight... /s
I just hate the "B" word in R&B songs, I'm only 40, maybe I'm too old skool.
who watch this in 2021?
IM DEAD. THESE BROTHERS ARE LIKE BUTTER, TOO SMOOTH.
"She  belongs to everybody..." HAHAHAHA the shade!
so sick, man
Another one
Gudang garam? LA?
These men all together are a match made in heaven, loved everything they've been releasing so far 😍
1:51 I laughed way too much :)))))))))
1:34
BEST SONG 😭✨
B
This a song about Will and Jada right? lol. But in all seriousness I do miss this kinda vibe in R&B.
Y’all better buy this album and support these brothers for giving us actual music.
Bringing back what RNB was missing  Cocaine.
I thought he was willing to catch a grenade for her, can't be the same man
This song got me feeling betrayed by a girlfriend I’ve never had
👍
Bruno Mars he sings beautifully and it is fabulous I would like to be like him in a big way
Banger after banger after banger XDD
Bruno Mars is the leader of the 80s 😍
“ This bitch “ 😂😂😂
1. Leave The Door Open 2. Smokin Out The Window 3. ?
🤣🤣..Really???..I didn't think this was really a Bruno song at 1st. How cute.
__THIS B!TCH GOT ME PAYIN' FOR RENT......LMAO
Why do men keep picking bad women when there are so many good ones struggling to make it alone. It's like they want to be manipulated.
Sooo good 😍
album?????????????????????
this is incredible
The way Bruno mars seems so fed tf up is hilarious 😭😭😭😭😭
Real music. Respect.
Hey silk sonic since the tone of this album is so 60s 70s R&B, do you mind making a disco album as a follow up lol
Culture vultures
Cigarettes kill. Also, so does Paak pretending to be dead.
I cannot, I was really not trying to like this song, but OKKK, they are fools. I like it, too funny....
sir we need an album
Out the gate with 3 bangers!!! They have tapped into what has been missing ing R&B music lately. 2 thumbs up!!
Sooooo damn smooth
He's literally dead for a moment! Ahahhahaha 🤣🤣🤣
this song is so cool.
😍🎶🎵🎶🎤🎧❤️💛💜🧡💚💙😍
I CANT BELIEVE IT. THESE GUYS ARE MAKING HISTORY. PERIOD
I cant tell if this song is successful or not because Im responsible for 12 million views by myself.
My heart got upgraded and this song helped it to have ears
Jackson 5??....michael??
Sou fã  .amo vcs. Salvador BA Brasil
I’m over here cacklin 🤣 love this!
I feel like the record labels played Bruno with all this old school rnb it's not trash but his genre was Locked outta heaven not this bs....he coulda been a legend in that genre now he just gonna fade out with all the mediocre temptation wannabe songs. We will all listen back to locked outta heaven and wonder why the hell he stopped making that style of music. When I want to hear old school rnb nobody is turning on this crap never will but walked outta heaven was literally the next level to rock pop. Harry styles will go down as a better artist than bruno and it's sad...smh
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruh…. Idk how they crossed paths but this is the best group we’ve seen in a while!!  I loved them both individually but this shit here… fuego
Hoow could he do this to mee
And another hit.....
R I P REPLAY BUTTON
"Sonic Silk" is the best band Motown never released. So good!
Dis Bitch Got Me😂😂😂😂 dis song is so funny. But so clever. Musical geniuses

24K magic sonic
Bruno and Anderson never fail to create a beauty to my ear
Hollering!!🤣🤣🤣. Laying on the floor and the pop up⚰️🤣🤣
Just go head and TAKE me back to 70s R&B!! Thanks Silk Sonic project! Actual MUSIC!!
This reminded me of The O’Jays - Forever Mine music video 👏🏽🔥. I love the song and the music video. Can’t wait for the album !!
Adoro o Bruno canta de mais❤️

this group needs Chico DeBarge and Kendrick Lamar to be fully complete
im loving this song
Why so smoo…th？
how do they always get it so right
80's vibe
What in the Ceelo Green is going on here
Who got Bruno  spending all his money 💰🤑👀🤔?🤣
キャバ嬢に貢いだ男のお洒落な歌
music at its finest
me: not being dramatic but i wanna die also me: *proceeds to be dramatic*
They're still incredible musicians, but by mixing their pastiche act with comedy it starts veering dangerously close to self-parody.
ICONIC
This b*tch get me paying the rent... I can't get that out of my head
This kind of song is just so nice and pleasant to listen to, love the part where Anderson .Paak lied down on the floor XD
I'd love to see a fucking Tyler The Creator IGOR style mash up with Bruno Mars, but also have Tyler hold a knife the entire video as a nod to his Yonkers Lyrics
This b!$%! Lol
Cigarette Advertisement !!!
I will never listen to this for the first time ever again and that makes me sad.
This is that hole in the wall music. Got me happy before going to work. Yaaaas! We need more of this type of music in 2021.
now thats what i call music, taking us back in time
Guys you should  make an album for us dropping a singles are enough for us
Mi amiga se hubiera sentido muy feliz al escuchar este tema , ella murió hace un mes y era muy fan de Bruno     Te extraño Sarah
Best song yet
They've gone from sweet, tender "leave the door open" to "this b*tch..." what?? 🤣🤣🤣 Smells like regret...🤣🤣🤣
Ayyeeee smooth 💯💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
YAAAS ANOTHER HOT DROP BY SILK SONIC
Reminds me of a time when the boys came at my door to go to the disco…..slow dance…the embrace and the cologne. Me in my midi skirt, Charlie perfume and my platform shoes,….the boys are grey old men now and I am this old grandma wearing midi skirts, platform shoes and Chanel…( Charlie is outttttt)
This is a perfect song for Kim Seon Ho's case!!! A man that was manipulated by the girl he once loved, deeply, terribly😅
U got taste in music🥂❤
The subtle jokes are perfection.
la mejor cancion por años
All the gold diggers pushing that dislike button 😂
SMOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Que música boa de ouvir! Bruno como sempre arrasando! Repertório maravilhoso! Anderson Paak tem uma linda voz!
Nice Song! After making a song on smoking as a resort to cope with stress they should do a song on detox for the fans-that are addicts of energy drink, nicotine, weed, etc. University students stressed out with grades, competition in academics and relationship break ups during Covid times do resort to smoking, drinking and other self destructive habits or addictions that affect their grades, career and health. Our Human-youth wanting to handle stress with intoxicating substances is not healthy in mind body and soul. The addict becomes a lability later for their family and some governments of developed countries that sponsor their education. So when stressed out with academics ,breakup, finances etc don't start to smoke but resort to prayer or hear some soothing music or talk to a family member or friend you trust or a psychologist if you can afford. God protect our youth not to go astray. I wish youth make wise choices so that their life becomes easier when they are older.
Great job silk sonic ❤️❤️ legit smooth as silk
Good to see songs like this without showing women dancing half naked..! Respect Bruno🙌
Bruno mars always got something , it’s is something !! yeah he’s always do got something special , Bravo !!
good song
Dannnnmmmm💥🚀
Am I the only one who can listen  to this ova and ova......
This combination of great artists make some great fresh  music....like a breath  of fresh air.....
How in the hell they keep making instant classics???
👏👏💋💋💋
i love you bruno mars.. ❤️🥺
😣❤
"Look here baby, I hope you found whatever it is that you need🚬...but I also hope your trafling ass is walking around barefoot In these streets..lookout".....I died 🤣🤣🤣
We need the album ASAP!!!!!!
hello taehyung, i know u’ll watch this again and again
Temptation vibes!!!! The dance 🕺 moves
Listen I can't have a life if you and Anderson keep making music ...I'm not getting sh@5  done around here. Another great song and a brillant videol
👏
How smooth was his first “this b*tch”🤣🤣🤣
Silk Sonic é a realização do sonho de muita gente que curte o som Old Scholl!
Dammmmmmm
they ruining the nice song with the shitty lyrics. too bad. what the asses
Love the song but the visual is waaaaaaay to basic. You are going to have plenty footage of live performances. In the official video let us see this Bitch. We want to see this Bitch(we know she fine). We want to see you smoking out the window of that benzo. We even want to see those bad ass kids and the UFC boyfriend. We already know the live performances are gonna be dope. Give us a Music Video !!!!! Respect and Love ✊🏿 ❤️
This video shouldn’t be as funny as it was 😂😂😂
do it 0.25 speed and you will hear a hidden song
Audience: "How are you gonna start your verse when the song is in full swing?" Anderson.Paak: "Hold my drink.... @0:31"  Bruno: "Aww, hail naw.... He ain't the only one....@1:35"
絶対マンネライン辺りがこれ完コピしてる(特にグクテテ)
this song premiered on my birthday now its my favourite
Yo for real this is the perfect music union. This shyt is straight 🔥!
If “she’s for the streets” was a beautiful R&B song 😂
Those grooves   Those moves  Feels so nostalgic
This is why I keep my door closed. She won't have me smoking out the window!🤣🤣🤣
I love that Bruno mars is bringing back this style of singing sooo good. Soultrain era. Love et
mj would be proud of it
This album bout to be 🔥🔥🔥
Another Bruno mars song, with a funky, soul and retro vibe.
Am loving this kind of vibe
Wonder how many times they had to vacuum the carpet between takes or even replace it because of holes / spots made by the cigarette ash.
Just chilling ,while listening❤❤❤❤
Perfect.
My old soul cheering for their music!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love this!
PERFECTION 🏆 From the arrangements, the voice ranges, the back vocals, the dramatic touches (that Sammy's moustache 😂, Anderson on the ground) and last but definitely not least, the fact that both giants showed their talents in perfect harmony. 👏👏👏👏
They did That 👌🏾❤️❤️❤️
à ta guise
www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpcNYN350yc    👍
Bruno mars bringing back the 70's style like the Manhattan's really makes everything awesome besides a good music
The child support anthem of 2021.
is that bootsy collins on the beginning? DAMN!
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die", literally the best two lines, and the best moment in music video history
Lalisa
the classiest and crispest "BITCH" i heard.
This album bout to do numbers!!
Britney Renner, this one is for you.
Superb in every level.
Just a smooth way of saying "She belongs to the streets"
proof that there is no genre of music that is old, irrelevant or dead.
The way he popped back in the camera 😂
Future smiling.
I wonder why “skate” didn’t work as well as this does
I just thought that Taehyung and Jungkook would probably added this to their playlist and singing this song in every mins
essa música= o golpe ta ai cai quem quer  tem  a msm energia  😂
Yoo said she's RATED E for EVERYBODY 😂😂🤣🤣🥱😂😂🤣🤣
Started with, “Guess I’ll check this out.” FF>>> “What just happened? Favorited…I’m sharing this.”
I am the only one who likes this better than leave the door open
Too all the heart broken mfs, let's make this the anthem
Ain't no clever, self-aware woman belong to everybody, what you been smokin out the window?  Everybody belong to HER, coz she knows exactly how she organizing everything around her
Bruno went from “talking to the moon” to “bitch ion like you”
He didn't say give to the streets...but give you back to City😂😂😂
Why Anderson paak popped up like that in each moment 😂 I can’t wait till the whole album drops. All in all true fucking artistry. This is what true iconic music is all about. Having fun.
Finally another song to listen for 2 months ❤️‍🔥
So jazzy n sexy
They are so perfect!! This is the hottest song I've ever listened 💖💖💖🤩🤩
Bad ass kids running my house like it's Chuck E Cheese🤣🤣🤣
This is the best duo I've ever seen including anderson playing dead on the ground. Hoping for more Collaborations 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙌🙌🙌
Oh rayos, lo volvieron a hacer.
Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die LMAO
Bruno Mars, Anderson Pak (SILK SONIC) is bring the smooth soulful sounds that we all need.
ブルのマーズの声めっちゃ好き
Loved it!!
Anderson was like, Bruno take over, I can't do this no over... Bruno was like, I got you man... lmao
I love it !!!!!!!!!!!
Yaaaaaaaaaasss!! Hurry up 11/12!
The intro right at the start, is that bootsy Collins?
Sarap sa tenga
Slightly disappointing after the last two incredible songs!  I hope that the rest of the songs will be on the same level as those before.
Feeling this .I can’t wait till they release the album 🔥🔥🔥👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
So she basically belongs to the STREETS
БААЗАР Жок на, Красавчик Бруно Марс. Маладес слова просто неть! Салам Большой Из Казахстана)))))
I haven't heard a bad song from Bruno mars
JUST DROP THE ALBUM ALREADY!
these men never miss 🧍🏻‍♀️
And another one!🔥
I wish they had not used the word Bitch in this song. They could have called her a Trick and it would have had the same effect. In my opinion, they are too classy to call a woman a bitch. Just my opinion.
FMで聴いてとても気に入って来ました。動画だと更にかっこいいですね❗️
the way bruno mars sings "BITCH" lol the song is so good
humans: cool music window: love it lung cancer: yeah that's my jam!
Yeah, spot on.
How good Andie is? Bruno backvocalling good.
They created it like a story  Leave the door open : proposal Skate : happiness and love  Smokin out the window : dumped and breakup
Smooth
ประตู > หน้าต่าง
Wow wow bruno u kill it....
This B#I*T#C*H! Hahaha best part I love that cut it's so dope. They make a really good combination absolutely amazing.
Je sais que ca n'a rien à voir mais ça me fait penser le groupe de Mickael Jackson Sinon bruno mars au top j'adore !
Somebody said Bruno closed the damn door & threw the grenade back 😭😭
I feel you guys
Lmgharba 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦 kamlin ybano Hna ❤❤❤
Ooooooohlalaaaaa je vous ador trooooop😍😍😍😍
"Oh I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong Cuz she belong to everybody, everybody"  Da, comrade. *communism intensifies*
This song is stubid.  Yet, I'm unable to click off it until the end.  These two formed the perfect team!  Their vocals are tight, and Paak be killing those drums too.
I watched this entire video with a smile on my face. WOW they've done it again, absolutely loved it!
The grammy is waiting for bruno🏆✨✨
this is so addicting  1:33
1:20 my neighbours upstairs when iam trying to sleep

This is the greatest collab album ever in the 21st century 🤣 anderson paak kills me lol ❤️👊🏼
❤️❤️❤️
He sent her back to the streets 😆 🤣 😂
Okaaayyy Bruno wit the James Ingram/El DeBarge falsetto note!!!!! I cannot wait to see the live performance! Mannn Anderson, thought you said “if I call her a b*****, it’s because she’s my b****…”… guess you shouldnt’ve left that door open🤣🤣🤣. You deserve an Oscar and a Tony for your dramatic role tho. 🤣🤣😭😭 We already know y’all got the Grammy!!!!🏆🏆🏆
this how bruno mars and anderson paak indorse a cigarette
I thought that was jamie fox
This is the best song of 2021 dont @ me holy fuck
The way he pops up in front of the camera after being dead on the floor, kills me....🤣🤣🤣  Ive watched this 12 times!   Well done guys!
Bruno ain't catchin Grenades anymore, he throwin em 👀

Damn, they make this shit look easy.  These guys hit it out the ball park every time.👍🔥🔥🔥🔥
He can literally sing anything
Easily one of the greatest music videos of all time and soon to be one of the most used for memes/posts 🤣😭🤣😭
Sing this to your cat.
very beautiful
they're simply happy people..i just love them<3
AKA the Alimony song
For those who like thumbing down good music, i pray that you will never hear good news.... silly haters.
Bruno is like going back in time with his beautiful classy MUSIC, I am in love again!!😘😘😘😘
redpilled lyrics: "But I was wrong, I was wrong, Cause she belong to the street, Cause she belong to the street"
Momma they doing it again!
this bitch is smooth as fvckkkk
😂😂😂
Bruno  looks like a disco balck dude in the 50s
That “woah” ecoing in my hear that make me slap someone
became redpilled after this!
Definitely can't wait for this album I'm enjoying music like this it brings me back
Wow
*Repeat
I swear this video had me cracking up!
Finally. I've been waiting for this album all my life!
1:33 how i feel when a minor inconvenience occurs  1:36  how i tell my friends about it
These guys are redefining the R&B & Soul music, both musically and visually
From the Door to the Window
Another quality music👌👌👌
Turma do caraioooooooooooo, viciante, envolvente, dançante, apesar da história......é para ouvir e viciar.
At this rate I believe Bruno and the gang are going to 50’s music (maybe even further), and I know I’ll love it
This joint is ABSOLUTE FIRE!
Wow
"Cant beleive it, im in disbelief" fucking poetry😭😭😭
Let's bak on 70's.....great music!!
This my new theme song🤣😂
😍😍🤩
Good song but fuck smoking
I've seriously lost count of how many gifs I've seen from this video - a video that has been out for less than 72hrs.   The "This bitch..." gif isn't going anywhere. It describes a variety of problems and it's hilarious each time you see it.
I absolutely love this group!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥😍
❤️👍🏻
この歌なんかハマる
Lindos! Amei! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love this 60/70s soul vibe. True r&b can still exist. Thank you.
I thought they were gonna say she belonged to the streets lol
“Dis Bih”! That’s big heat🔥
smooth 😍
he curses elegantly
なんで途中行き倒れ？　からの復活、！！ 日本人には理解できん
1:36 dramatic as shit but that's a whole mood
This album gonna be flawless man, how do they keep doing this
Y’all giving me LIFE with all these hilarious comments! Whoooooo!! 😂😂😂  Loving Silk Sonic! Takes me right back to the 70s! Umph umph umph! ❤️
As cool 😎 as the other side of the pillow.
“Not to be dramatic but i wanna dieeee”
I need a song with bruno Mars and theweeknd
Man just went from “when I was your man” to “this bitch got me paying her rent, paying for trips”
How many grammys is this getting? All deserved.
Bruno throwing the grenade back
I'm pretty sure that girl's name is Natalie.
Bruno Mars looking like a DeBarge.
I wonder what kinda cigerette is that. Seems to last that long 🤔
Sempre entregando o melhor. Por isso sou fã. 😍🤩
Thanks 🙏
This one goes out to everyone who was blinded by love only to realise....they belong to the streets.
This video is giving me 70's Soul Train vibes - it's perfection.  You can see Anderson's personality rubbing off on Bruno. I can't remember the last time I've seen Bruno being so playful and over-the-top. I love it.
😍😍
💖💖💖💕💕💕
This music video got me feeling like I'm in the 80's or something 😂
I was waiting for sensual R&B and then "This. Beach..."
Brings back memories of the Four Tops and The Temptations.
"Just the other night she grippin' on me tight screamin' Hercules." *stomp* *stomp* *stomp* Me: 🤣💀
From the streets she came.
Bro man hasn’t drop a bad song!? no matter if you like him or not yenno damm well you vibe to song
WOW I Never Thought I Would Live Too See Exquisite Again 🎩
I’m not even a smoker, but I want to fresh pack of Melbourne after listening to this
Another great tune but for me the lyrics seem rushed and not though out well, just my opinion, still love silk sonic and bruno mars.
I see LeBron James
Soooo sexyyyyyy
he really went from "count on me" to "count me outta here"
reminds me of Back Street Boys
The cigarette.. Oh yeah ✌️👌
Jahongir Otajonov ga oxshab yotib olarkan sahnada. 😄😄
smoking chillss
Wow !!!!!! Musical genius !!!!!!
Just by reading the name of the planet close to Venus, when the notification pops up... I knew that it's another great Slap on my soul... Where am I.? Don't want to know anything as long as you feed my heart... 🥰
Just say wow👌😍😍😍😍
OMG! SO SMOOTH!😌😌😌😌😌
got me shivers hearing this song good job y'all
"Trifling ass walking barefeet in the streets" killed me 🤣🤣🤣
WE NEED FUTURE ON THIS FOR THE CULTURE!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Of course she belongs to everybody. Anything new about females we didnt know?
Man I've been waiting for some new hits to come out from Bruno
And Bruno does it again 🤣🔥🔥🔥
I just love how this is so modern but they do the old school sound so damn good. ♥
Gotta love the Sammy Davis Jr. look-homage here :) even the style of singing reminds me of how much I love (and miss) Sammy Davis' music.   Hats off the Bruno Mars and his incredible team for bringing back the retro, old-school music back to this era :) something we surely need .
POV she belong to everybody    for real fam.sad!
THIS SOUNDS SO EXPENSIVE! ALWAYS ON FLEEK!
This is a sad man's song, but somehow I find it funny.
Dope
Please  comment on  me  I love you
Smooth!!!
LITERALLY LOVE BRUNO MARS SO MUCH
Gostei muito da música mas não devia ter cigarro
아 너무 좋자너~
Que delícia de música, que delícia 😋
Whoever these slick mfers think they are, they are
that b!tch definitely not love you. she loves your money 😂
와우 👍
Why does this feel like a SNL sketch?
MY KIDS LOVE  YALL MUSIC 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The smokers anthem for 2022
These jokers got me legit laughing throughout this song and feeling this joint at the same time. They crafted this one to a T with their signature humor and musical quality. Silk Sonic a problem straight up LOL
Sample???
he ain’t catching grenades no more
This album is going to be LEGENDARY!!!
any sound they drop automatically goes to #1 on trending
Good!
The music was so good Anderson Paak came back from the dead to sing 🔥
Bet everyone thought that was Gucci mane for sec 😂
This the shit right here! Whatever they're smoking..i want in..lol
Idk why but this song has a kinda new edition feel eg. Mr.Telephone man 🤷‍♀️
These guys are so great. Now that's entertainment. Awesome!
BANGER!!!!!!
Scrubs
SOOOOO FIRE STG!!!!!!
Finally, a good fucking music. Let's go old school!
Screaming herculessss 🦵🏽🦵🏽🦵🏽🦵🏽😂🔥
Anderson a living legend ❤️🎯
I hear remnants of Jackson 5’s ‘Never Can Say Goodbye’  Bruno Mars has went from pop to funk to old skool RnB and has created hits after hits in each genre. The other thing I love is that a new generation will go back on time and discover what their parents and grandparents grew up loving.....
Bruh my shoulders are moving on its own
60's ThrowBack
Bruno finer den eva 😮‍💨
クレイジーファミリー来ますかね🎵
Selalu bagus lagunya
This is MUSIC
Okay Bruno Mars, you did the retro thing for a min now, I’m bored of it. Can you release an album, make music with somebody else other than .PAAK and get with the times… please?
Welp! Looks like we finally have a replacement for Mariah Carey's All I want for Christmas song
KS would say pick your women better.
they said: this 😌 BITCH 😤😡🤬
Eine herrliche Persiflage auf Motown Music! Brillante Musik, brillanter Text! Ich lache mich hier kaputt!!!
damn its very so cool mam🤩🤩🤩
1:15 the choreography so simple but effective my favorite part
This is real music! Vocals, musicianship & arrangements!
he's throwing the grenade back
I have no words. He never fails😂😂😂🔥
When the sugar daddy fed up
OMG THIS IS AMAZING !!!
Is Retro Funk Irony a genre? I should be.
Looking forward for all the songs from the Album 💞
Yyy…
There is some James Brown in here somewhere....lol
pogi
Simplesmente perfeitoヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪
Love the moves 🙌🏽 then cracked up at THIS BITCH! sung by both then topped it off with Anderson playing dead 🤣🤣
Libra Energy! A fkn masterpiece. I could go on.
dishwashing theory
I am here for it all silk sonic 🔥🔥🔥🤰🏼
12,091,335
I have watched this six times today.... I have finally found something I love so much.😍😍😍😍
anderson .paak and bruno are so extra i love it!! xD
The sound was immaculate, the choreography fun, the whole video slick af and also the lying on the floor was hilarious. I really love this whole production.  That said, the opening line was a bit of a slap in the face. Spending more at tiffanies in a day than most of us make in a year. It hurts, man.
I love the back to the 80s vibes
Bruno and Anderson I don’t want to play this album on a CD player, it’s gonna hit different on a record player. Drop them vinyl copies
Cool dance
Can't believe they waited this long just to release the third song. The hype for return of Bruno Mars has died, apparently. Judging from the number of views the first song had compared to this one's.
She belongs to the street
TOP🔝TOP 🔝TOP🔝👏👏👏👏👏👏 Just love this song! ❤️ Love you guys... love your performance in the video clip! ❤️ It takes me back to the sound and magic of MOTOWN, which I miss so much. Thank you guys for that. Can't wait to hear all the album! 😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anderson .Paak playing dead on the ground hits the world different
the best combo ever history gon remeber this legendary duo forever thew will be like QUEEN of the following generations
wait, is this song for real?!! 🤣 I can't with them and the lyrics!!
Why did Bruno yell at me second 1 of the verse. Like 😳 damn! Ok! 😂 I’m listening. Also, the suits. Those suits. 🤤
Esse cara canta muito sem comentários
too smooooooth🔥
Why that man laid out like that😂😂😂😂
WUEENAK TENANNNNN COKK!!
오졌네 ㄷㄷ
Listen & burn your cigars in front of your window with warm coffee in the morning 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
Guess the door isn't being left open anymore 🤷‍♂️
i thought is treasure
Best Duo I’ve heard in a minute
This is the anthem of the simps lol XD
It's Hercules for me 😂😂😂
I know I'm going to be addicted to this 😭😍
I love youuuuu
This that Grown Folk Break up jam
just a dope dopE doPE dOPE DOPE
Yasssss album about to be off the charts
Lyrics are not cool. Grown folks music and foul language doesn't work for me. Music is nice. Lose the first 8 counts. Bad start. Lost interest at bitch.
Amazing 👏
Motown vibe.   Smooth as.
Adoroooooo❤️❤️❤️
okay i gotta cover this song
I wonder how many takes it took to get him perfectly in frame after getting off the floor 🤔😂😂
damnnnnnn smooth AF
That Bruno intro funny as hell 😂😂 good ass music tho!!!!
It's the not to be dramatic but i wanna die for me 😭🤣
So this is not only featuring? Are they official band?
Smokin Out The Window please leave the door open！！
Carrying that classic old spirit vibe we quite frankly needs
Should rename it to "Puffing out the window".
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Classic as always ⚡
✨A pimps pain ✨
♥️♥️lovely
if i was smoking like that and sang in a powerhouse im gonna choke and die. then thats the 1 minute of my life see you after reincarnation, adios
Anderson won the Gulag that quick damn
日本を嫌いにならないで下さい。😭💦
This reminded me more and more to Jackson 5
😂
Everytime Silk Sonic releases a Song i feel Like there is still Hope for music 😮
Love the sense of humour guys!! 🤣
Get on my nerves!!! loolllll Love them! super smooth
Window, door. you are a fresh man
Those lapels.
Anyone else reminded of the Jacksons.. i keep thinking “lookin through the windows” lol
Went from Motown to MGTOW
Best song released since 24k magic
Great tune, great vibes once again. Bruno puffing like he wants it out of his system fast :p!
this song actually is  for kim seon ho.. lmfao :")
70s gold 🙏👌
Already a classic💫
Yeap, they winning grammies with this album
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎❣️💕💞💓💗💖💘💝💟
I regretfully hate to admit it, but for this being the ultimate "She's for the streets" anthem, I'm curious to hear what a Future remix would sound like. I understand and I'm sorry if I offended anyone.
Dear friend, the "Good News" is the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is, "Christ died for our sins; He was buried, and He rose again the third day according to the scriptures." (1st Corinthians 15: 3-4)  The "Good News" of Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life to salvation. Receive the truth and believe it this very moment.   Precious believer, may Father God our Creator, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior and the Holy Spirit bless you and keep you abundantly now and forever! Amen!! 🙏
“Hey Siri text papa👴🏿 tell him I got a new song for us to listen to” 🥰💛

A BIT OF TRIVIA ~ Bruno Mars ethnicity is Puerto Rican and Filipino - White. What is bruno mars race? Bruno Mars was born  in Waikiki, Hawaii in October 8, 1986. what is bruno mars real name: Peter Gene Hernandez. He is nationality is Hawaian.
Hands down 3 top songs are all from Silk Sonic. Lovin it guys :)
From catching a grenade for you, to throwing it back at you. 😂
When he said "THIS BITCH" I felt that in my soul!
This is the best thing to happen to music in a while.  Had some big laughs, and some vibes.    Side note kids- don't smoke...  even if she's a triflin ass bitch
Si no me equivoco Bruno Mars creo algunos pasos de baile porque nunca los había visto
If this isn’t the most soulful way of saying “she belongs to the streets,” I wanna see/hear it.
"she belongs to everybody"💯
From throwing grenade for u to throwing grenade at you. #ineedsadbruno HAHAHAHHAHA
insanely beautiful!! <33

It’s my 4th time playing this song
🚭 🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭🚭
chain smoking chain listening
Amazing❤❤
Sick🔥🔥
Why is Anderson on that floor 🤣
Love all Bruno Mars
Bruno Mars is the only crackhead to actually keep it together.
It’s the LYRICS for me!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
4 more days before the album💚
🔥🔥🔥
Dios los bendiga!!  https://youtu.be/DpeJ7z_Yo5g
Anderson: *dies* 15 seconds later "Smokin out the window of the Benzo, the Benzoooo" 🤣🤣
Is it too early to predict Grammy 🤔
Not to be dramatic but i wanna die🤣🤣🤣🤣
This song funny af
This gonna be a hit and ima remix this 😛
Bruno is a great musician
Translation: Freak in the sheets, but she's for the streets.
It's also good to see brothers singing again with class and style🙂 representing YES!!!!!!
Lol love this song especially the when he said bad ass kids running threw the house like it's chucky kids ,and this bitch got me paying rent and smoking out the window  lol
Wow, the way they transitioned in between is flawless!!!
This is getting old, I like the throwback tributes but now using it too much
he ain't talking to the moon no more
Looks like Bruno ain't catching grenades anymore.
Cool
TE AMO SILK SONIC
3/3 HITS🔥🔥😭😭 ALBUM OF THE YEAR
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The background reminds me of Bootsy Collins 💙yes SAY YES" NOW I BEEN THERE BROTHERS... SOMETIMES A LADY OR GENTLEMEN CAN BE A BITCH !!! UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT THAT!!! I WAS SMOKING OUT THE WINDOW 👀
She belong to the Street would be better than Everybody.
I guess Bruno closed that door
Loved This!
this masterpiece is 🔥🔥🔥
Ok I died when he got back up 🤣🤣
They actually might make the #1 best album in history Geesh they’re 3/3 for BIG HITS timeless songs
Is there any bad Bruno Mars song?
Classic is always awesome ☺️
Magnífica
Wow! I never knew that Benigno Aquino would be here...
Bruno isn’t my type, but damn the amount of confidence, swag, n talent…I just know he throws it DOWN in the bedroom 🥰
Simply the best
I hate cigarettes but Bruno can blow smoke in my face and call me "this bxtch" ANY DAY
Song is so melodic! ❤️ Wish they didn’t make smoking look so cool in the video…😸
‼️‼️‼️🤧
🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷
I tempted to start some mess and send this to my ex. but, naw, she wouldn't understand why I sent it. She never knew I found out she cheated. She told on herself not realizing it. I already had enough reasons to drop her. No need to say anything. It would be hilarious, no lie 🤣.
🤣🤣🤣
I want to hear them cover EVERYBODY period. Nope even them too! That's right I said it.
People have been yearning for this kind of music for a long time I’m so glad these guys are doing it right😎👍🏽
The grammy’s is gonna be nothing but a silk sonic award show🔥🔥🔥
I love you guyz shame,LOL
jirrr enak banget
Damn.. Bruno Mars and Pak are just geniuses man the lord gave them powers
This sounds like a parody of what R&B music should be..
This music is such a classic 🤌❤‍🔥
OMG if only Isaac Hayes, Al Wilson and Curtis Mayfield were alive to see and hear this.
🔥🔥🔥
Damn..this is so lovely 😊👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This album is damn near perfect already
He said he had to give her back to the city.  Nice word play using the City Girls.
get Bruno Mars to sing this dressed as Randy Watson and it'll be perfect
Bruno smooth as Baby Wipes 😂😂😂😂😂
The playfulness. The musicianship. The peak a boo moments. What a time…thank you to these folks for making 2021 a tiny bit easier to deal with.
See all this time you artists where drinking all kinds of liquor and lean and percs to make your music hot. You should have done coke and made silk sonic like these two legendary gentlemen.
So smooth
“THIS BITCH!!”
Coming out with another banger!! Lets gooo!!
Bruno definitely threw that grenade back😂.
I'm digging 1970's Soul Train vibes.
That’s what y’all asses get fa leaving the door open.😂😭
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Instant classic. Paak is special.
has gotta be one of the best music videos in alk of music video history
Yo bruno.  First of all the temptations love your style and second but still first is anyone got u smoking out the window ain't a btch.   She ta woman.
Bruno the modern day Micheal Jackson prove me wrong
Love it! Need more music like this reminds be of back in the day music, when music was music.
Bruhh 😂❤️ classic ‼️
Not sure why Mars thought having lit cigarettes would enhance his videos. Nothing sexy or cool about a smoker. Promoting smoking is just pathetic.
Bonita, pero me parece todo igual a las otras canciones con Silk
If Leave The Door Open wasn't the official Welcome To the Big Show for Anderson .Paak...Smokin' Out the Window sure as hell is. I was literally LMAO every time he was on screen. He's complaining that his ex had him buying her "diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists..." and the whole time he's wearing...diamonds on his neck and diamonds on his wrist.  And then he says he doesn't want to be dramatic...and then falls over and plays dead...and then pops back up to sing the next verse! LOL! This is some funny shite. As someone who grew up in the '70s with groups like The Temptations, The O'Jays, The Whispers, The Dramatics, Gladys Knight & The Pips, Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes (shout out to Teddy Pendergrass!), The Spinners...this shite is classic '70s soul without the language filters. Well done, fellas. Well done.
Grammy for album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, best song for a group of duo, best New group. We're looking at 5 maybe 6 awards here. Chart #1 on billboard top 100 the day it drops, and #1 R&B. Album is going platinum week one.
Bruno can sing about ANYTHING and it'll sound good. This dude can do no wrong!
From a dad and mum who built their foundations took people in who owned a home to a child on the system when dodgey people come and go and made decessions this should be my anthem why i would just preach to my own kids raising my kids ive paid rent for no stability from men i aint no bitch and ive paid and work for vehicles that other bitches a passengers off over it
Hes the only one stick in 80s 🤣🤣🤣
What are you smoking! Music is slamming, but you should hold the BITCH lyric! How are women of all ages supposed to celebrate that! Just down right degrading.... So sad for our young people to think we are too ignorant to write respectful lyrics about being left! Temptations, Four Tops, Spinners' etc. Take notes from these great men, if you're going to try and emulate these great writers and performers don't go so low! And you really went too low.
класс
Yassssss‼️‼️‼️ once again y’all are fucking legends😂
back to old times and old rythms...so addicted to this music, to the band and to BRUNO Mars.... such a great collaboration....
literally smokin...
1:20 was my absolute favorite part of the music video 😂😂
Some how these guys got hold of a Time Machine, took a trip WAY BACK and brought back the SOUL...
waiting for the album
ALGUNOS ENTENDERÁN 😅 ESTO ES OTRO NIVEL #Bruno
🚨 Lil Wayne has been robbed and shot rare footage 😱👇🏽 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ntB-or3Xh5g
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
why smoking , smoking kills dude!
I love this 😂
Bruno is so damn swag. Pure greatness.
This makes me think that, Bruno still got stuff to get off his chest about Natalie. 😂
1:49
Three hits, no misses so far 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mrs. Klump is so proud of them for throwing that HERCULES HERCULES HERCULES! In there LOL  <3
I would love to go to this concert!
Start smokin bc friends or breakup❌ Start smokin after hearin this song✅
GOATS BABY Daddies 🥵
😮‍💨😮‍💨
damn bruh
I'm addicted please i can't stop watching this 😭 i just know that kim taehyung also come here everyday to watch this 😂😭
I blame bruno for all this gold diggers out there thinking they the shit
Should have been, 'She belongs to the streets' instead of everybody.
Hercules Herculeeeeees 😂😂😂😂😂
this might be the most descriptive song ever
I miss this entertaining music videos with simple catchy choreography 👏👌😊👍
totally right...   why every ladies do to men like this
Bruno can pull anything off 😭
Smooth!!!
bruno never misses 🤎
another top 40 hit!
Look at them just having fun with music’! Love it
Bruno hit notes higher than those cigarettes could’ve ever made him. His singing has become so much stronger over the years. People who have been taking hiatuses like Bruno, Adele, lorde, and other top artists that came out in the last year have really only gotten better.
THIS IS A SMASH!
How about those Bootsy Collins stars ⭐️🤩 in the background??!  Love the nod to him 👏🏾👏🏾
Them creating this group is one of the best things to happen 😭🥰🥰
The cigarette and his mustache 🤣❤️🙌🏼
💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
She belongs to the streets- future
Nice beat, nice old school vibe but why use the B-word. Common Bruno and Anderson.paak you guys are better than that... You guys make great music, you don't have to degrade women to get your point across.
This is a certified hood classic
The dynamic duo we didn't even know we needed.
I can’t stop watching this video 😂😫🔥🔥🔥
Now this is some GOOD music!!!
Woooow , amazzzzzzing ⭐⭐⭐
Disclaimer:  No Newports were crushed during the making of this video.
It's like the song treasure but painful
que som meu Deus, brasileiro agradece. ♥️
We're all streaming this now?
1:38 Michael Jackson

Smoking out the window. Bloody Selfish Behavior...

So bland
Cool
I love seeing men dance. It’s everything 🤩🥰
Most of their songs on the album are the same.
This needs future on the remix💯💨💨
Now I Gotta Give You Back To The City, Oh!    Genius or what?
火星哥行啊

Freakin masterpiece
The 5.5k women that disliked this song belong to the city 🤣
Awesome 🔥🔥🔥

Bruno Mars never misses 😎

🤩🤩🤩🤩
"Smokin Out The Window"  Wait a minute, this love started out so timid and so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could you do this to me?" (How could you do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookoin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the benzo Singin' "How could you do this to me?" (How) "How could you do this to me?" I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody Yeah she belonged to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round dead in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could you do this to me?" (How) "How could you do this to me?" I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody Yeah, she belonged to everybody Ooh
I like this 😁🙏🏽🙌🏽🔥🔥🔥
love this
On repeat for the week 🙌
5 more days till this album drops and I prepaid for it months ago! CAN"T WAIT!
Just in time to make song of the year ❤❤
Existen canciones que pueden saborear y esta canción esta exquisita ♥️ algo muy típico de bruno mars “Grande”
One word pops in my mind while watching... Smooooooothhhhhh!
Omg I love this! Yesssssss!!!
Bruno: You know what would hilarious? If you just... laid there. Dead. Anderson: Lol bet
I just don’t like perfectly harmonized and synchronized music. I like imperfections and raw performances.
Man... AGAIN!!!! When the end came I was like "Nooooooo- it's TOO DAMN SHORT!" SO...maybe once the album drops and breaks EVERY record Michael Jackson's Thriller set- they will put out a "Remix" version where every song is like 10 minutes. #CantGetEnough #LoveSilkSonic
Nothing particularly impressive about this one at all.
Who hurt bruno
I don’t think artist sell a million copies anymore but this is a CD and a vinyl pick up.
Man that was insane      💗            💔     👧👱         😰 💐👚👕    📱👗     👖👖         👖     👟👞        👠👠

Will Smith will receive royalties from this song! LMAO

Best thing I've seen in a long time. Just absurdly brilliant!
The word "Bitch" is hitting so definite in this song😂
The real heroes of this video are the slow burning Newports, Marlboros, and Kools throughout the video. Paak never let it touch ground even while he was being dramatic. Lol
BOMB BOMB
FIYA!!!!!!!!!!!
Silk sonic is gonna be a classic forever
She belong to the....."City". yup!
damn this song really came out at such a clutch time. this bitch had me smoking out the window too haha
Whoaw whoaw~~
I feel like having T-Pain on the remix would be amazing.
😄😄Awesome!! I wasn't a big Bruno fan until he got with Paak 💯🔥
They way Anderson Paak was layed out on that floor .. HILARIOUS!!!!
Silk Sonic got me mad at this bitch I aint never met in my entire life!!!!
Shit actually fuckin slaps
I LOVE THEM......
I'm so tickled at these transitions by Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars! This song is epic af!
😎😎😎💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
When he said “gotta give you back to the city!” I felt that deep 😮‍💨
This man really said “this bi *ch got me paying the rent”😂😂 and he had me dead when he said “got her bad ah kids running round my whole crib like it’s chuckie-cheese”😂😂😂😂this was fire tho🔥🔥
I don't like Anderson Paak:(
Yo, I can't stop laughing. How the fuck they be calling her a ho in the most beautiful way
BEST TRACK FOR 2021!!
They took she belongs to the streets to new heights   and my side hurt from laughter 😄🤣
So sweet and romantic song. Bruno and company remembers me times of Earth, Wind and Fire, Kool and the Gang, Temptations, etc. Beautiful!
This is 'Elite Beat Agents' live action.
When he said “THIS BITCH!” I felt that
another song to vibe!!! 🔥🔥
Another # 1 Hit🔥🔥🔥
Bruno head lean and cigarette thump  "This Bitch "  PRICELESS!!! forget year album of the decade hands down !!

Brings me back to early slap-stick songs of Bruno’s like Lazy Song and F*@$ You.  Also, I see you .paak! Got the diamond necklace and bracelet back. 😂🤣😂🤣
I mad appreciate that Anderson .Paak didn't even burn the carpet when he died
hahahahahahaha, on man. I love it.
😂😂😂😂
My god ,🙏
Bruno in the past: I'll catch a grenade for yah   Bruno at 1:36: I'll throw a grenade at yah

AARRGH. SO GOOD. And so funny with it! Love this. Thank you (again!), Silk Sonic, for this beautiful, bright spot of 2021!❤️
Future: She belongs to the streets  Bruno Mars: She belongs to the whole city 😆
THIISS BIITTCH!
LMFAOOOOO this shit is hilarious. Makes you want a cigarette too, shoot
soooo gooddd!!
Their vocals are seriously no joke. No cap
Cold-blooded...Rick would be proud...Got the dude feeling so cold 🥶....Yes, she belongs to everybody.🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣
The way Anderson comes in on the first THIS B**** 🤣😂🤣😂 then the laying down for like 16 seconds 🤣😂🤣 and then saying walking round barefoot in these streets. Fix it Jesus 😂🤣😂🤣😂
i literally am crying bc it is so aesthetically beautiful and i can’t figure out something i would change. wow
love this.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak, and Silk Sonic was born to bring us old school soul music, and they do a really great job. Masterpiece!!
This album gonna be crazyyyy🎼🎼🔥🔥🔥
I feel sexy
This has Dave Chappelle written all over this this is hilarious

Haa!!!…okay!!!!😃
Poppin ❤️🙌🏾💯
Woof ...  ;)
They basically saying she belongs to the streets 🤣
Paak Lyrics Supra Simp
In this day n age where music is pointless and all about fucking and drugs its good to listen to music that  brings back the  old school soul music  vibes
Comment ne pas craquer ? Velouté des voix masculines, intonations soul r'n'b revisités,  chorégraphie sexy, Silk Sonic fait un carton plein.   Quel dommage la présence de ces cigarettes, ce poison horrible, responsable de tant de vies humaines  détruites à petit feu. La clope, c'est pas cool !
Just so fucking good.
This song is so BEAUTIFULLY Done it makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time. AWESOMENESS dripping everywhere ✨✨✨🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥲🌟✨✨✨✨✨🤣
“Just the other night she was gripping on me tight screaming Hercules”🕺🤣🤣🤣
💣af no 🧢
Another ☝️
I’m in love
Ghetto thot song with a twist. It's alright, but not what I was expecting from bruno Mars new album. It's subpar.
Love this song 😍😍😍
la perfeccion echa cancion increible esas voces poe Dios
Silk Sonic is bringing back what should have never been lost, old school smooth moves and sound with a bite. Definitely getting this album. Now if they could release it on 8 track and I would be set, LOL.
굿나잇
Thought that one man died
I didn't skip this ad pretty amazing
If this album don’t win a Grammy!
What a dynamic duo 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 🔥🔥🔥
Simp classic lol
Na, going to have all the "I spent my money on her, so she's supposed to be with me because society told me that's all I have to do"  dudes singing at the top of their lungs. 😂
Literal gold ⭐️👑
1:46！？
Smooth, funny, heaven to the ears...
Sensacional!!🤩🤩
Just pure talent
Cada vez lo veo más parecido a Michael Jackson 😅
Absolute perfection!!! 🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥🔥
love it
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeshhhh  🔥🔷
This song wouldn't have gotten 1 radio play in the '60s. Any real soul song from the era beats this simplistic forced wannabes attempt.
From catching granade to smoke the window
The world was in no way shape or form ready for this tag team like when randy Orton and Matt Riddel became a team
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Silk Sonic & Bruno Mars for bringing back old school. Now please let the rest of the music industry catch on. 🙏
That's a fabulous!
Anderson made death seem so cool👌🏽.
Retro..... sensuality ❤️
When did Sammy Davis Jr join the 4 tops?!
The Motown choreography tho ,bring it back
Un dúo Bruno y Adele por favor
Leave your door open because you're smokin out the window.
This is just so so goodddddd
Nice work fellas. Soiunds reaal good. Oh, BTW, on the View, the girlfriends are buying guns and training at the range, So, just a heads up. Watch yoursellf. Don't need no Sam Cooks round here.
OMG. This is straight up hilarious. Dying’ over here! 😆
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die" LMAO
smoking American is perfect!
Yummy!
Bro lying on the ground dead and pops back up had me dying!! Thanks for bringing back great music!
All I want to know is who hurt you? dam 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
These guys were meant to make music together. Destiny.
#bringbacksadboybruno
Smooth AF
Bruno isn’t catching a grenade anymore, he’s throwing it right back 🙃💀🥰
Notice how all of their songs so far hit #1 on music.. BRUNO'S BACK BABY! 🔥  Can't forget about Anderson Paak tho, his voice is magical too!
💛💛💛💛💛💛
I love how Anderson.paak just faints on the floor and pops up out of nowhere in the middle of the song also nice song keep up the good work
เพลงนี้สอนให้รู้ว่าอย่าตกหลุมรักกระหรี่
got slowed and reverbed already!!!
🎧🎶🎶🎶🎶👏👏👏👏👏
But I also hope your triflin ass is walking round here in these streets 😂😂

♥️♥️♥️🥰😘🧿👌🏻
Lol so good
Dope.....Glad to see there's still a lil real talent left out inna 🌎.
Fuck with this song heavily
I want a Christmas album from them
That’s what you get for leaving your door open and telling her to skate… just saying 🤷🏾‍♂️
I love this song and Bruno Mars of course. Not going to lie Anderson Paak is starting to grow on me too. I love how great they sound together. Plus I love how extra and comical they are 😂!!! Especially in this video when Anderson collapsed in the floor and it zooms out and he is still laying there dead... Then 5 seconds later he literally pops right back up like a daisy lol 😂!!! You can definitely tell they are having fun making this album!!! It is going to be the best!!! Silk Sonic can you all please just go ahead and release it already?!?!?! Lol 😂 I literally have it on my Christmas list haha 😊
Beautiful Art.
✨✨✨
For a second, I was like “why tf is Gucci dancing in the back on the right?” 🤣🥴😭 Lawd. No more wine 😂
He laid on the floor there popped up so fast 😂😂😂
Silk Sonic making perfect music and videos to boot. Real vibes are back
EVERYTHING about THIS
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️COMO LA DEJO DE ESCUCHAR, no importa IGUAL NO QUIERO DEJAR DE ESCUCHARLA, es que ME ENCAAANTA ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
They bringing that real rnb back.
It was Anderson on the floor and staying there for me😭😭
This shit so fye lmao
I really wanna know who's choreographing these dance routines ❤️‍🔥
this hits differently
WHERE IS THE ALBUM. THEY DROP LIKE ONCE EVRRY TWO MONTHS
oh my..this song is so perfect ✨❤️
💗
Bruno is UNDERRATED! 💪🏼🎤🎶
Bruno & Anderson are perfect together🖤
11m  views in 2 days 🤣
This is perfect
All the songs sound the same😴🛌🏾
Dont like how you are promoting cigaretts
the video clip is so funny bro cant stop laughing
We always get the blame.  My name Juan sound like one, yes out the window 🪟 can't win.  That's All FOLKS!
the followup we needed. excited all over again!
So smooth with it. That’s what I love…the truth
This song is so good and funny 😂
TE AMO BRUNOOOO
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
this is like the smoothest music video I've ever watched
The melody is just the top notch retro quality Paak and Mars got us used to, but the lyrics honestly sound like a trolling, MGTOW song lol
We got 5,000 haters that came here to hate on some good music for nothing 🤦🏾
Bruno Mars never made a bad song.
I'm here for the cigarette sway! 🕺🕺🕺
Why isn’t this 100m yet!!???
하..ㅅㅂ.. 다 좋은데 진짜 다 좋은데 저 담배만..ㅠㅠ
Excelente... 🔥❤️
It's the commitment to the aesthetic, vibe and drama for me! I'm here for  Anderson Paak dead on the floor. 🚬.  🚬.  🚬
Why is this the dopest thing ever created
There’s so much vocal surprises on this song, it’s amazing I love it
The second Anderson hit the ground all dramatic like that…I was a goner 😂
This video was hilarious😂add it to my playlist
So glad I was born in the era of SilkSonic. Their music and story eats me up so badd, soo goood! s o g l a d.
When Pak died and resurrected I rolled 🤣😂🤣 I peeped that Delfonics inspired intro as well that was a nice touch.
I love ❤️😩😂❤️
IF THIS AINT THE CATCHIEST HOOK
This song is pretty red-pilled
Broooooo this goo sooo hard
Okay who did it who horn this man?
The band is so chill 🤩😎
70s all the way
I know bruno has a chill life.
Whoever hurt Bruno.... please apologize!!!
Man I love this shit, instant classic
ANDY IS IN HIS BAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Whe he says  "Hope that your trifling ass is walking round barefoot in these streets"  make u wanna trifle and walk bare feet
Damn! These guys gotta stop going back to 1975 for their recording! It’s not fair to everybody else!
lindus
Oooooooh
A Feast in the midst of a famine!!!! Keep feeding us …  we are grateful
As much as this is the video I can really imagine the video as per lyrics fam. They should do a 2nd one
Crazy how much Anderson paak looks exactly like Bobby Womack 😆
Just amazing
Entregou tudo!!! Gigantes 💗🎆🎆
now THIS is a great music video. The song is stupid and funny, but so what? The singers put a crapload of work into the choreography and it is wonderful, fascinating to watch. Bruno's Sammy Davis Jr thing is just too overwhelming. Brilliant. totally worth all the time and effort they put into it.
They went from “leave the door open” to “imma change the damn locks”
Magic ❤️‍🔥
Toxic song of the year😭😭💀
Finally REAL music not that trap crap and mumble singers
i can't handle this
Dwamn! I vibe with this frequency.
Someone got bruno mars all the way fucked up LOL
My mans died for a whole minute then magically came back from the dead, very good music right here
Why Lord? 🥰🔥🔥🔥
Owwwnnn💗💗💗💗 Que tudo! Eu amei esse estilo "The Stylistics"💗
my favorite part has to be the part where Bruno is acting like a blacl mama who bout to whoop ha kids like: "This bitch got me-"
🤣😂🤣😂😂 love it. Let’s Get It!
The Temptations and Jackson 5 moves. Dramatics and high falsetto did it for me.😂😂😂😅😅😅😇😉
God it’s so good seeing this being number 1
Love it... Not Chuckle Cheese.
For the streets anthem ‼️
Damn Bruno looks like Lenny Kravitz!
Who they singing about
Silk Sonic la está dando con todo🔥
SHE BELONGS TO THE STREET!!!
AWESOME....!!!!
Performers through and through. Bruno looks like a Mafia boss though.
Is it me or does Bruno Mars look like Sammy Davis JR?
My all time favourite bruno mars.....
So chill
Damn they really don’t miss
bruno has gone back in time from the 90s, the 80s, the 70s, and now here we are in the 60s
Buwahahahahaaaa.... I'm dyin'...lmbo
It's nuts how much this song grew on me in just 2 days
When Anderson said "not to be dramatic but I wanna die," I felt that😭
And just when i thought Music was at its darkest moment, this song is the hope and light i needed!
holy crap this is mad talented
Reto Soul!!...Love it :)
groovy 🕺
This duo & The Weeknd’s upcoming album are going to run 2022.
Thank god... eat R & B isn't dead!! I miss it! Thank you Bruno & Silk Sonic!!
"This bitch" -- such a bitter an anti-woman ballad. Why? Disappointing.
When you listen to the lyrics it’s so funny yet so real
Not only did that B**** break his heart……she broke his bank 🏦
Amoooooo
Thank goodness
Whoever got Bruno out here like these can catch these hands 🙌🏾
I haven't pre-ordered an album in years. I did this one. Can't wait, y'all!
Sounds like a sped up version of Leave My Door Open......nnnnnnnnn it too is fkn greatness..
Woooowww we need the album ASAP 🥲🥲🥲🥲
This is funny as shit😂😂😂😂😂
Simp Anthem of the year
Bruno Mars ain't never disappoint anyone with his music damn.
love the old school vibe
Love, Love Bruno Mars & Silk Sonic......
I love this song 🇯🇲🇯🇲
😱😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
11 Milli in 2 days. Icons.
MASTERPIECE
Silly lol. But cool
😍🥰🔥🔥🔥
10M✅
Welp. Guess I’m the only one wondering what they smoking on,? And if it’s only a prop?
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Muito legal
I can't stop watching this! Such an epic video!! Just wow! They thought of everything. If you don't get the concept of this video you don't get how 70's groups put on theatrics in their performances at their shows.  I appreciate they have recreated that, yet it's sounds modern. This is a straight banger!
Shoulda named this song “receipts”
Another Music Legend!!!
Another solid gold hit got me back in the 70s in my mind.  Loving these smooth tunes and arrangements.
This don’t make no sense! This is BADDD!
You need to break up with this woman immediately.
They did their homework! They’re paying homage but yet it feels timely and fresh!
Chill sad song
Man i have absolutely loved everything that silk sonic has released so far. anderson and bruno together is a literal cheat code, i can not wait for this album! and maybe one day i can be as big as them with my music🙏🏻
When you finally found real music! And real singers! Fudging FINALLY!
This freaking music video is great Lmfao
The cigarette is the best touch
I don't know bout y'all but this gives me Christmas vibes
Making people rich to teach poor habits is so contradicting. It works for the upper world level
This song funny and sound good all at the same time
Thank God music Real music
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Smoking out the window!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
☠️☠️☠️ I have never laughed so hard at something that sounds so beautiful 🤣
LMAO!🤣
When AP fell out then popped back up...I screamed.
Omg . Totally 70’s vibe and LIT ! I have hope now . 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I absolutely LOVE IT!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Some real music in 2021 much needed 🔥
THIS IS ICONIC
0:32 now y’all can’t tell me y’all not finna be replaying that part
Like it’s Chuck E. Cheese had me DYING
Nah cause Bruno said it with a *capital B,* somebody got him fucked all the way up
F*CK YES!!!! MOTOWN IS BACK!!!!
😆😂🤣🤣 bruh… DIS BITCH got him out here  paying rent and 💩🥴🥴🥴🤣😂🔥🔥🔥💕💕💕 love that silky sonic 💩🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
I have not watched the grammys in year but will be doing so this year. You guys deserve every accolade you get. The vibes is awesome.
The video kind of humorous and smooth at the same time. Anderson keep popping his head in the screen.
Album will be iconic❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥

This aint old soul or r&b. It's INFLUENCED by those things, and that's dope, but this is still regular Pop. Just be real about what it is.
You got a hit when Bootsy Collins opens the song
Keeping the funk alive
this shit so good
I love the way Bruno sang “This bitch” and how Anderson fell to the ground and then got back up for his part 🤣
Love love love

Wooow! 🙌🏼👏🏽
Love everything about it except the usage of the word "bitch." Definitely wasn't needed.
My favorite part 1:19 🌿
Maybe they are making a house album, Leave the door open and now Smokin out the window. What's next?  Walking to the roof?
Demasiado floww
Paak was dead for so long, I thought the detectives were going to bring out the chalk. 😹🤣😹🤣😹

Isso é uma falta de respeito, tá muito humilhante 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
fiesta en neuqueeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnn
Message!! 📬 😂😂
I wouldn’t have done that to you Bruno 😭
Brilliant!
Hell yeah
Y E S. ALL I HAVE TO SAY‼️‼️‼️‼️🎯
I just KNOW those studio sessions were way too much fun! I don't know how they finished a whole album because between me vibing out and laughing at them, we'd accomplish absolutely nothing!
A whole vibe from the very first second
If she belongs to the streets was a classic.
Cader os Brasileiros fã do Bruno ,o cara manda bem em tudo que faz tmj.
5.3k of yall have 0 soul dis shit go harrrrddd
It was just 750k views. Now it was 10 million wow
Guess we leaving the door closed then lol
asikkk bgttt astgrgrrrrrrgt
The O'Jays are smiling somewhere.
When he was smoking out the window singing, he for sure was smoking a joint.
This tune, just bring me back to my youth
For all the Skeeza’s lol
Thom Bell - do you hear this?  lol
This track is perfect!
Great song
BRO
TG Silk Sonic and Bruno Mars are back to save music! 🤣
I am living for this groovy vibe🤩
Bringing back the choreography that blended with every phrase of the Sweet soul music from back in the dày!
Sounds like a tribute to Bootsy's "You got me wide open" - I mean why not, he named the band!  One of my faves
This is definitely a banger
Who else think the real lyrics were "Smoking in the window - sucking on indigo"
SO EXCITED FOR THE ALBUM
*This Bitch* brought me here
🔥🤣🔥💯 The soul, the comedy 🎭 it just keeps getting betta!! Silk Sonic is my favorite band⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
These brother brought back old school style it's very nice to see bravo bravo👏👏👏👏
Can’t get enough of these guys. That’s entertainment baby!
I need the back-story to this song. This is HILARIOUS!
This like new edition meets soul train!
Daaamm!
A Stop simping anthem, he should have dedicated this song to Kevin Samuels
THIS SHIT IS FIYAH
That second bar 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My bro Bruno finally got tired of these young wild girls stressing him out
nice, smoking is cool again! tobacco executives happy all over the world...
When you didn’t give your sugar daddy no sugar lmfaoooo
Que perfeição!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This b....
LOVE IT
This is so good that I want NOT to listen it. It is that precious!
I thought he died.  He was on the floor a long time. #SoDramatic
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love this song a I always love Bruno Mars and he is doing really well with music. Wow 🤩 from PA
this video made me crack up almost choke on my soup dinner a couple times but I love it😉. I watched it over and over 😝The harmonizing is awesome as usual.. I guess this won’t be funny if you are the biyatch 😝 How did Hercules Eddie Murphy line got into this lyric … 😆  Anderson doing a dead person spot pose on the floor is hilarious 😂
1:19 and 1:44 Anderson fallen on the ground HAHAHA.... these parts... i'm going crazy.
*They are so wildly talented.* I'm in love with this song! Just, wow. ❤
Wow WOW WOWWWW! It just gets better and better!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰man
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
All the folks digging too deep into these lyrics and using it as an excuse to say some misogynistic shit, y’all are the problem. Bruno and Anderson are in stable loving relationships with their ladies and that’s why they can make comically classy songs like this without being in their feelings. Grow from y’all’s bitterness. It’s no good for you
❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's what happens when you leave the door open 🙄
This album gonna be a solid 4000/10
Got to buy this song.
this reminds me of kwangsoo dressing up like this
best song ever man, honestly
Damn Trae Young, Basketball ain't enough for you?
I love Bruno bcuz he takes it back to the band days and Anderson adds a little sumthin'. 70's!!!! Classic!!
They'd say "This. Bitch." to me and I'd be like "Yeah, you're right. I'm yo bitch."
This man Anderson's died and came back to life 1:45
Its been too long since I've replayed a song nonstop like this.
Nossa melodia linda amei top. Parabéns pelo trabalho
🐐🐐🐐🐐
the energy is unmatched! SILK SONIC is killin it right now
I’m not alright after this video. Got me smokin’ out the window or something….   PSA: I don’t smoke but that’s how good this song is
A hit as always
lol...goofballs.  i love it :)
Smokin looks healthy right now huh
masterpiece.
Smoking out the windowwwww yesss nice beat melo and funky
WOW NICE 👍👍👍
I’m Never disappointed 🥰 #timeless  #oldschoolvibez
I can't even express how much I love this
Now Bruno, you shouldn't have left that door open.
They deadass look like Prolific-Ass Pimps! I've played this so much, they should pay me! 🤣   🎶 This Bitch Got Me Payin' Her Rent...! 🎶 #HAMMERCY 🔥
No entiendo lo k dice, pero como m encanta brunno me aviento el vídeo completo.
Such divine talent. 💯
Bruno mars went from when I was your man to smokin out the window lol
I love this ritmo the song is a piece of art that just draw into the melody and just shakes it up I'm very proud of bruno mars 🙏💯🇵🇷💪🔥
Oh they done done 🥴
Diss.. Bitch  Got Me Paying Her Rent  🤣🤣 sugar daddy blues
The fact that they are smoking a cig and singing lmao 🤣
I feel sorry for the girl but damn this song is giving me some chill vibes~
I like how paak got to lead this one both really great singers
'Look here baby, I hope that you find whatever it is that you need but I also hope your trifling ass is walkin around barefoot in these streets' 🤣🤣 I feel this bar..! I LOVE the petty A.P 👏🏿🤣 Some people just for the streets
I’m lovin’ your groove, but can you please replace the pejorative “bitch” with ‘chick’?  Y’all are better than this low-class word. Thank you. 🙏🏽😊
R n B is back! It's been more than a minute! Plus the message is on point!
I don't know about the other guys, but I'm happy to finally have a smooth R&B petty ass song for this generation!
Berasa nonton boyband 90an 😭✨✨✨
Danmm !!
"Not to be dramatic,but I wanna..die"✨😝
I liked the first two singles, but this one I ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.  I already downloaded and can’t stop playing it.
So on point. So silky. Liquid gold.
Lol like Chuck E Cheese
5200 dislikes all by women named karen.  Cause they out on the streets wishing they had their sugar daddy back in the sheets.  But they wanted to be noticed by the world, instead of just one guy laying it all out for that one girl.
Omgg
bruno mars ICONIC
1:44 -pfft-
That light skin guy be on point.... lol .... I ran when I seen it was new yall turn off everything I got to listen to this ..... Bitch got me paying her rent and smoking out the window
Forget the album, Where's the sitcom?!  Also, forget that I said forget the album.
Lol the amount of SAUCE in this video ‼️ I cannot 😫🥵🙌🏿😍
Love it!
Baby all y’all had to do was tag my ass !!!!!  ♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️😈
I love it so much🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘
So we are just gonna ignore Anderson laid out on the floor?! 😂 Out here looking like Dave Chappelle’s little brother.  Love the Bootsy Collins signature star. Bootsy is a king of funk, so I know the whole album is funky like an old batch of collared greens.
Song of the year. Video of the year. Album of the year to be sure!!!
I can't stop listening to this song, I just can't. It's a damn masterpiece. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Fiiireeeeee
I’m loving this old school vibes 😍
Absolutely love this song. I just wish they didn’t use cigarettes 😭 should have been weed.
Such creative chemistry and talent. A collaboration of epic proportions for the millennials.
I wish this song would have never ended ❤
I love this song! It's a bangers! I love this group! We need more soul/RnB groups! Growing up we had lots of groups idk why record companies stopped signing new RnB groups! This is what's missing from today's music!
FIREEEEE 🔥🔥
This... Bitch!!!! This song is fuego!!
This song is so accurate.  Give her back to the streets because she belongs to everybody lol.
Como los amo
Getting old school soul music vibes from them😮‍💨😮‍💨
Do your thing guys! This is super duper fly from a old school head!!!!!
Nah, this a BOP
Nah, the head tilt when he said “THIS BITCH” killed me😂
“This BITCH got me payin her rent” 💀💀💀
Love this! The melody, vocals, N instrumentation is a masterpiece!
"Not to be dramatic but I wanna die" - Anderson, 2021

HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME >:(

Reel banger sa
So we're back to normalize smoking
Take it all the way back to the 1970s Soul Train era in the retro video for their Silk Sonic single "Smokin' Out the Window." an old school TV set while rocking wide lapel tuxedo jackets. Absolutely fantastic. 😮
I guess this is what you get when you leave  ya doors opens  huh  Kids got in too huh smh....but this song is amazing  👏 lol I love it
This shit hard asf I wish I was born in the 80s/90s
Anderson looks like he’s on that 🍃💨
Awe I was ready to give everything about this song and video an A+ until they started calling the woman a "b**ch.  This is an old school song which is lovely but back in the day they didn't make songs where they called women b**ches.  Sigh.
love silk sonic 😍
Always the best music.. 😍
It’s been along time since someone put Chuck E. Cheese in their song

Whatever you do. Do not remix this and put ANY rapper on it. It's great already.
I didn’t think they could top “Leave the door open” SSHHHIIIEEEEEEETTTT 🔥
Brunooooo el mejor!
Looks like he tried to buy her, without being there emotionally,  and that never works out , ask Trump😁
Bruno got the Midas touch 💯💪🏽
M X 🇲🇽
Bruno's emphasis on "This BITCHH" , with the cigarette and head tilt took me tf out!💀

The cigarettes spoil this video.

Silk sonic is the bomb🔥
A hit song saying that She belongs to the streets. Genius.
all these fine ass men in this video.
THEY DON'T MISS!!!!!!
Seems like the men learned more from their mothers and grandmothers than the women nowadays. Trifling word of 2021
Oh wow so perfect guys😮👌😍😍❤️❤️❤️🤞🤞🤞👏👏👏👏

We are living in the glory of God #grateful
This is wholesome, I love  it
Teaching them youngsters aka kids born to parents of the 90s about the songs their grandparents started their families too
All hail the King of "bitch you got me fucked up" as per usual, another master piece of this brilliant human being
Why is this whole song a meme?! Lmao
what a cheap video,  his label knows that his music flopped, and that he won't sell more than 2,000 copies
This is amazing! This song is hilarious and wonderful all at the same time! I love this.
i’m getting my hands on a vinyl as soon as i can!!!

I like the music except the cigar part.
In short this song tells us how bruno and paak feel when girls reject them
Saying she for the streets in the most soulful way🤣🤣
kkkk the girl hurt their feelings ..lmaoe
my ears were blessed
EVERY REAL MAN KEEP IT 💯. IF A WOMAN REALLY PISSES YOU AND DO SOME TRIFLING MESS, YOU SAY IT IN YOUR MIND JUST LIKE THEY SAY WITH THE SHORT PAUSE, “THIS(PAUSE) B!” 😂
Ok but bruno went hard on that ''this b'' at 1:36😂😂😂
*not to be dramatic but i wanna dieee*, me
HEY TELL ME IS THIS NATALIE'S DAUGHTER?!!
Every "This b" in this song felt hella personal 😂😂😂
Fuck that grenade😭
Old Style music is the best. He does it awesome!
Somebody said y’all was bringing back hairy 😸🐈🐈‍⬛ music and I lost it lol
This is the type of music we need today.
The people who disliked this need a Covid test because they've got no taste.
i see i'm not the only one who's been hurt this year from a relationship.  thank you, Bruno. I needed this for my 2021 anthem.
This b.......loll 🌟😂
These boys getting high together this music to damn good!
Oh I love them so..!!
Never ask a girl why she is doing this to you.... YOU KNOW.
What are y'all so dramatic for 🤣
cocaine makes the best type of music
Bravo!!! Like " Four Tops "
The best of the best in the music word today
Nashe
I love this song.
FIYA🔥

New national anthem for all men
Them OF shawties got my mans Bruno mannn 🙏🏾😔
If you don’t like this song your life trash
Damn, these fools going to make me start smoking again smh
The white Zaddy is always using our people to suppress us,this song is designed to belittle our culture... We are not People to Belittle !!!!
Alguien sabe porque últimamente hace colaboraciones y ya no canta solo?
5.1k Trifling @$$ haters from the city
I need him ari and The Weeknd to make a song
Man they are so good 😊
I am loving the old school vibes. They are really pulling it off 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Bruno is on another level of greatness. This is a masterpiece. He had me at "ChuckE Cheese" 😂😂😂
new old school love it
O maior artista masculino! Amém Bruno Mars 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Those who disliked this are probably those deadbeats who likes to use people for their money. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This song is🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m bout to wear this song out 💯
These two together are 🔥
All the dislikes are the trifling women they talking about 😂😂😂.
A magical duo! Im so glad they found each other and gave us these jewels
FKN. PERFECTION.   everything about this….damn.
Dave Chappelle could sing
It's the classier version of "she belongs to the streets"
https://youtu.be/OXkxe55Dhc0
Ohhh how I love Bruno 💕
Should’ve gone for 50% OFF HAHAHA 😝 😉
It’s ok not bad
Real music right ppl

This song is hilarious 😅
Great song…I was waiting on a flick of the cigarette though.
THIS BITCH!!🤣🤣🤣 bruno tired
Bué fixe esta música, obrigado Bruno Mars e Anderson Pack , curto bué de vós
que trabalho explendido
You guys are the best thing that happened in this century  I LOVE YOU
Didn't think I would like a song more than leave the door open but damn this is my new fav
Omgggg
Not the cig, Bruno is STRESSED
That's what THOTS do, but you all keep encouraging this behavior.  Times keep changing, and not for the better.  This "feminist" movement is a sham.
They're 3 for 3! This album gonna win every single award.
"just the other night she was gripping on me tight screaming Hercules Hercules"! 🙌🤣
The second he says "THIS - BITCH"! I was so surprised, LOL best moment in the song
VerY GooD BiG SouL  🇺🇸🇮🇱 ShaloM 🇮🇱🇺🇸
I like Silk Sonic, but I really like Bruno's old crew better!!
Bruno mars threw the grenade back
A who trouble me man lol!! Love this though Bruno vex and still slay!
The suits, choreography and the toxic angelic lyrics harmonised to perfection. This right here is the rebirth of the funk Golden Era we never got to experience thanks for bringing this to us 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She belongs to  the streets instead of everybody 🤣 that would have been Epic
He went from "imma leave the door open" to "imma change the damn locks"
encore une masterclass mais quel Roi purée Bruno on t’aaaaaimeee
Look at 1:42 at Bruno's feet his feet is like "let's get ready to dance."
😂😂😂😂 listen lol the part with Anderson on the floor and Bruno coming in with that damn cigarette in his hand took me out 💀
I adore the song and MV but wish the cigarettes were fake...
Genius
It's the "This Bitch" and the little flick to remove the ashes for meeeeeeeeee lololl
*The best song to listen to after a breakup*
Bruno in fact, did not catch the grenade
Yup this girl got me paying  her rent the best part who can Relate keep it coming 💯
Fire.  I absolutely hate the cursing in the song
Wow verry nice idol
0:31 kills me lmao
<3 <3 <3
What a classic 👌
the dislikes are from the girls that made Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak  Smoke Outta The Window
I'm not even offended by the B*tch reference, I've seen the type of women they're singing about.  Just Raggedy skanks, not all women.
Bruno and Andy will be going down in history with greats like Michael Bolton , Freddie jackson and etc
Let's talk about the magic the cameraman is making. Like the very subtle movements that go with certain beats. Ugh this reminds me of the older mvs from the 80s and 90s and I wasn't even born then!?
This is why I listen to there music!!! Please keep the hits coming!!! Old School feeling, Real Music!!! Bruno the truth!!!
New viral meme. “DIS BITCH…”
Do over no.......B#&@/
I'm so sorry for Bruno it's like Atlantic records want to keep him in the past#free bruno
I mean he threw the grenade back.
Man threw the grenade
"Got her bad ass kids running round my house like its Chuckie Cheese!"  Ha ha ha!  I literally did a spit take on "Dis B*tch got me" LOL!  😂
Which girls got y’all fucked up?😭💀
This a hit Bruno Mars I felt this song 🤣🤣
This is the shit
Give her ass back to the streets Bruno!! Lol. Y’all did this one . Salute!
Cadê os brasileiros? Meu Amor Minha vida, Bruno Mars, ❤❤❤❤  olha mais um sucesso Ai 😎🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
When someone says they have the same waifu as you.
Feeling like i took a time machine and am ❤ it💯🕺🏾🕺
日本から愛を送ります
Simplismente sensacional !!!
Bruno Jackson
This is every mad/pissed man's anthem 😂
She done made Bruno go from talkin to the moon to wanting to run away to the moon 😭
Funky smooth groove. Too sad it's degrading women🤔 Wow another song with no substance. WAKE UP!!!!!! Y'all bigger than this. Change the world with all that talent. Give kids a chance👍👍👊
HERCULES! HERCULES! 👏🏽👏🏽😂😂

1:49 is what has me rolling
Nossa finalmente me sinto em uma época que quis viver🙏
🖤🖤🖤🖤🤯
This is a new one for me...I havn''t heard this one before today...This must be from the recent album..."Smokin out the window."  Love this love this...😎
Well gahdamn....
I guess in severe circumstances u have to compromise and pay to pipe clean her
This song is really worthy of the 10M views in 2days.....its a blast, they never disappoint with their jams.......
a
Silk Sonic has restored my belief that the world still love to hear real music artists and that there is a place for R&B artists. Not like the fake ones auto tuning and shit. Bravo to Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak and the rest of the guys.
Stope being that IDIOT Bruno WTF 😳 I like that PEACOCK NASCAR 77
Gotta Love Their Style "Old Skool" 🥰🥰❤️❤️🔥🔥🥰🥰❤️❤️🔥🔥💗💗💗
2 days and still on 10m what's wrong with you people 😩😭😭
0:49 "smokin out the window" ...by AP is gold . Killer!
“Went from catch a grenade” for ya to “throw a grenade at you” haha
Smooth Video by this group 🎵
Looks like Bruno had enough

OMG #ITSAVIBE bringing that good ole school back
I needed this.
this is fantastic XD
come on guys... leave some talent and swag for the rest of us
😂😂😂😂
So silky smooth fuhh...
Kinda cringe for 2021; "I spent money and I didn't get sex! This sex vending machine is broken!"  Just don't. Especially these wealthy entertainers, if your date can't pay rent you just look like a predator chasing poor women for a power advantage.  Donate to a charity that builds housing and creates housing security.  Stop trying to trick women into doing sex work.
I’m just waking up on those guys got a bit of catchup to do
Cold very cold 🥶 dayum!!!
This is a classic 😂😂😂😂 beautiful song
😢Y'all lost me on this one with the cigarette and name calling 💔
I Neeeeed this on luscious vinyl A.S.A.P.! no Spotify or stream, just amazing black vinyl....
Please release the album!! i can't wait anymore😭😭😭😭
That's what that bitch gotcha doin?!
Another one 🔥 🎶🎵

"That your trifling ass is walking around here barefooted in these streets"...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
WELCOME BACK R&B!!!!!!

Alright that does it, I need this album like right now. These two compliment each other so well.
Smokin'!!!

I bet Future loves this song
Perfect man! <3

How do I feel about politicians and their lifelong appointments 1:36  I hope all your trifling MFers are walking barefoot in these streets..😒
Bring that music back home. Where we can understand the words and here the band playing instruments for a change.
he threw the grenade back
Wow cigarettes in a music video. Culture is really going backwards and I’m not complaining
Just like the Jackson 5

"She belongs to everybody"? Anderson and Bruno better get themselves tested.

absolutely phenomenal
WOW!
Love this vibe! Such a great song ✨
How could 5,000 people not like this song 😫
🙏🏾✝️
I can't handle that mustache. Some things should stay in the 70's lol
What can we do so this two never stop making music together?
He threw the grenade back
This is not a happy song, but why does it feel so good?
All the dislikes are cancel culture folks upset that Bruno said the B word. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
They need to put Rick Ross on the remix
Bring back the oldsch vibes, love it
They make music ANYONE can listen to and love no matter how old they are.  Beautiful 😭❤️
Yall really did that ♥️
Wayne Brady must proud after Bruno had the courage to say the B word.
THE BEST!!!! All hail silk sonic!!!!

🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
This is such a contrast to most of the absolute crap that dominates the pop charts. Look! Actual talent!
Aye lmfao 🤣 I just died a lil. I feel you Bruno... #ThisBitch
This is NOT hyperbole. An Evening with Silk Sonic is shaping up to be one of the best albums ever recorded. Any genre. First 3 tracks have been flawless.
https://youtu.be/LfuvaHU_Bsc Lyrics flow 🔥🔥
In the next racial draft. The latino delegation is picking Bruno Mars. In exchange We will give you bad bunny, Ricky Martin,  Maluma and the whole island of Puerto Rico . Gosh Bruno Mars is the epitome of Rico Suave.
I love how they both take turns singing the pre chorus :D
He said "this bytch" took me out lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  I CANT HELP BUT TO LOVE IT
a smoker would be lucky to have a woman.  Really.  Do you understand how disgusting it is to kiss a smoker?
A whole vibe!
Can anyone tell me name of that tall FINE AF backup singer? For special research, ofc.

All the feminists finna cancel these boyz 😂😂  City Boyz we up 😂
Cocaine music at it’s finest! 👌

How do they even make it through filming without a cough or choking or getting hiccups from the smoke? Ew.

This is priceless lmao!
IT IS ILLEGAL TO SMOKE CIGARETTES IN A MUSIC VIDEO.
Awesome old school sound! Way to go!
Velho, o cara não erra. Que música!
this is the first song that I really liked after a long time
Que música viciante
Thank you, Silk Sonic for reviving a music genre, R & B, that through your song, dance, and expression reminds our young people that there is much-much more to them than what they are daily told.
Bruno took that red pill
This raw as hell 🔥🔥🔥🔥
smoooth
make it a gift or a meme : 0:15 OH NO 0:21 WHOA WHOA 🚬
Bruno mars said got her bad a*s kids running around my crib like it's chucky cheese 😭😭💀💀🐐🐐🔥🔥😂😂
You know they don't need to even release a CD. Just keep releasing tracks
Thank god someone still play this wonderful kind of music❤
Perfecto, no tengo más que decir.

SHEEESH that's KRAZY

Beautiful song.
The count starts 1 milion ✔️ 2 milion ✔️ 3 milion ✔️ 4 milion ✔️ 5 milion ✔️ 6 milion ✔️ 7 milion ✔️ 8 milion ✔️ 9 milion ✔️ 10 milion 🕺
I'd say I contributed at least a couple thousand views to this instant classic ⚡
idk why but I feel like I need to pay to watch this ?
"this bitch" always gets me 🤣🤣
Thumps up if you find the lyrics relatable xD
CLEAN, FRESH, TALENT. Absolutely love everything they do.
Waoo,  se pasaron con este tema, son los mejores
I LOVE THIS FUCKING SONG I WAS TODAY YEARS OLD WHEN I FOUND MY FAVORITE SONG TO MY X ON MOMMY PLAY THIS AT MY FUNERAL
Geniosss
Old school look but it’s not y’all calling girls bitches. Sold your soul huh
Thank GOD for Musicians like this!!! Old school feel with new age lyrics.. You can literally VIBE off all their songs....
Класс)))!!!
The cigarret was not necessary
This song is an absolute Masterclass in Song Writing and  Sonics.
I wish my dad was around for this. He would of loved it. 🧡
I’m in public right now trying my hardest not to sing the song and do the moves...but AP laying on the floor while Bruno continues to sing over his body is pure perfection ❤️  raise y’all’s pinky finger to the moon for this 🥃
My my my 🔥
Hahaha melhor música e clipe possíveis 🤝🏻😂❤️
The album is not even out but it surely deserves the grammy
and another one
I promise I have never been more excited about an album being released as I am about this one.  I'm kinda late to the party on Bruno but my goodness....I have listened to this one song at least 125 times since its release.  Everything just kinda melds together into this one beautiful smorgasbord of sounds and beautiful voices.  Well done!  Anderson and Bruno are the PERFECT PERFECT compliments to each other and I hope they plan on doing future projects.  This one is definitely a hit out of the park.  Music I can appreciate and enjoy listening to.
❤️
Anderson .Paak's first OH NO makes me weak everytime i here this song. its just goofy in the best way
This songs hits harder than my alcoholic step dad 👨‍👩‍👧
This song is hilarious💀I love it
Ótimo essa pegada anos 80🎶🌐
Silk Sonic, no paran de sorprenderme. Qué maravilla!!!!❤️
Fuuuuck. I just feel like Jackson 5 for a min. Dang bruh.... Those time.
Maaaaaan lmao Anderson.Paak on the floor and then popping back up is SENDING MEEEEEEEE
Loving this song and the video!!!!
IS PERFECT OMG
These guys are bringing back the good old style of music we enjoyed in the 80s and 90s. This was when music used to make people fall in love. This is wonderful!!!!
10M in 2 DAYS SAYS IT ALL!
Anderson Paak inner channeling his Eddie Griffin Spirit animal
The cigarettes held it down the whole video lmao
True artists can spread a controversial message so smooth it connects worldwide. I know for years Bruno will be up there close to the greats like MJ.
I guess vaping out the window wouldn't have worked as well.
Did these here muthafuckas say Dis bitch????? IM.DONE.😳🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's sad but at the same time the sound makes me happy, i love it
🤣🤣🥰🥰🥲😭😭
Alright,Alright, Alright!👏🏽👍🏽😍
Probably the best duo we didn't expect, but we needed 😂. Every single song has been 🔥 🔥
I love u his whole energy
Who are the 4.9K people that didn't like this?!
"This bitch"
Put on 240p for true experience
“Dis. bitch.” lyric heard round the world lol
Am addicted to this song😂😂
and im in 3th grade
dang wow good job i lisen to you all the time wow when i was a baby too when i was 3 in a half months old
Something all generations can enjoy!!!
this be some cold ass funny shit!!!!!
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I mean it’s cute but R&B Lite, great value r&b, soul music after a couple of washes at best
odié la letra y siento que ya están muy gastadas este tipo de producciones y vibes, ya no es orgánico, o sea la ejecutan bien, pero pareciera que no aporta nada diferente o que no evoluciona como artista. Sólo mi opinión.
The slow kneelnat the end took me OUT. Classic icons !
🔥🔥🔥
Yea, bring back the old school soul music from the early 70s
Just legendary. Bruno Mars just decides to live in which ever time his heart wills. He's got a smooth 70s vibe going on here. He doesn't care about the current sound or style of music. He creates music from whichever decade he pleases and a good song is always gonna be timeless so this completly different sound works even when released today. This brotha has a time machine. I'm convinced.
you better stop leaving yo door open💀
https://youtu.be/YZYd7fxJhFw
Great learning song! This is why you never date single mothers, move in with them or have them move in with you. Send her back to the baby daddy(s)
4.9k former smokers don´t like this song...
When comeback your old style Bruno...
Can't wait for Jk's cover
mori de risa jajaja muy buena!
Kids don't smoke cigarettes.
Im tired of Bruno wasting his talent on 50's, 60's and 70's styled regurgitated remakes
The humor is just total icing on each cake they bake for us poor fans to thoroughly enjoy. Excellent as usual, guys!
So I would call this R&B, soul, and Pop, what genre would you call this? Just curious... either way I LOVE IT!!!
Anderson Paak is the main character for me
Música top lembra bem velha guarda soul dos antigos the best
2:26 why is no one talking about this 😂😂😂
Uma melhor que a outra.......amo!🇧🇷🦋❤
I love the theatrics in this video!  Bruno & his crew are so damn bad ass!
Little Elvis doing his thang 😁
What kind of music? Funk?
Viben all smooth :😌 All of a sudden : ........THIS.. BITCH.   😂😂😂😂
the way they dance with the cigarettes kills me.
This is straight FIRE!!!!!!
YOU DONT UNDERSTAND MY SOUL WAS ON FIRE LISTENING TO THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME
Stop it...can't take it!
Omgggggggg I LOVE IT AHAHAHAH    THIS BITCH GOT ME PAYING HER RENT
This song is straight 🔥! Got her 👶🏃🏡 like it’s Chuck E. Cheese 😂 🤣 💀
I was getting nervous but this one put us back in the groove
Wahou'..bravo Bruno
It should be illegal for someone to sing as well as Bruno Mars can
THIS IS AWESOME 👍👍👍
PAIXÃO,  por VCS!  Beijos, beijos, beijos! Boa sorte hoje e sempre!
So 4.9K people gotta be “this bitch” that got my mans smoking out the window. Or they might not have a cigarette or a window to smoke out of 🤷🏽‍♀️
Bruno FED UP. He done with catching grenades, he throwing them 💣
👏👏🔥🔥💥💥🚀🚀
Cuando se hace y produce MÚSICA CALIDAD NIVEL DIOS....eso es bruno mars
this happens to boys  who have to many girls
This is gives me David Ruffin vibes
Sedutor.  Mágico.  Belíssimo!
Where the feminist at? :v
Jesus.... what a falsetto brunoooooooo 🥲
The way he passed out lol
Doesn't my boy, Bruno, smoke anyhow??
I like the sound but, Degrading Women is not cool.  Calling women a Bitch, give her back to the street.  No Bruno, I don't like the words.  I'm sure the young people think there is nothing wrong with the words.
Yesss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ion wanna be dramatic 💀🤣🤣🤣
That Grammy gonna be yours soon, huh? 😄💖 You deserved it, you should win it 🤍🤍
thankGod we still have living breathing creatives like this to bless us with great music
the duo we didn’t know we needed
This is hilarious 🤣
Always nice to hear real music, love it

Looooove.  I wish your tickets weren't so expensive!!!! 😭😭😭😭 but I get it , I get it. You're worth more. LOVE YOU GUYS
The Legendary Bruno Mars ❤️.
The way Anderson stayed on the floor LMAO. I LOVE how they have that 70's throwback AUTHENTIC sound, choreography (and cinematography, the overlays etc) but the lyrics have a touch of humorous up to date references. Amazing!!
I guess Bruno said fuck it and he throwing them grenades back at you girls
That's vibe 💓⚡⚡❄️
Put my boy Weeknd on the remix 🙌🏽
When Bruno hit that note!!!.... It brought me back to the days of James Ingram... Everybody knows that, whoooooo whooo!!!!
Love this!
Watch Faking Love
this song reminds me of the Chi Lites 70's group ' Have you seen her' there is lots of 70's R&B vibes but i like the song nov 2021
Oh yeah, this gonna be Hoodville's new favorite song
Paak is so dramatic 😹
Yesss!!!! The lyrics are great!
💓⚡⚡❄️🚨💊🗿🥊
YESSS
Classiest diss everrrrrrrrrrr❤️❤️😆😅🤣
I typed in “this bitch” in the search box and found exactly what I was looking for.
he said he closing the door 😂😂
1:43 POV you're Travis Scott
paak and bruno gave me the same vibes even before they linked up, this is the perfect timeline
Now this is music...Take notes young fellas.Please write your own music as much as you can.It will stand the test of time.
#LetsGo #PureGold
This is ANOTHER banger!  Bruno Mars and that vocal range is showing these other guys out here how it's done.  Who writes these lyrics cause they are tight!  Alot of men can probably relate at some point in their lives😂
keep them coming Silk Sonic, keep them coming.
https://youtu.be/dtdXC7AOBt8
BRUNO NUNCA DECEPCIONA
ME ENCANTAAAAA
They killed that!!
Que pasada de vídeo clip,me encantan.
This killer sound and video. Im dead laughing "This Bitch"
I just love how smooth Bruno is.  He gets up off his knees & doesn't miss a beat & is immediately in step with the rest of the group's dance moves. Silky Smooth! His dance moves are so fluid and effortless!
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                  / ,., . . ,/. /     /  , /.,                 /  .,./., /. ,. .,/,/.   ,./ ,./, ./ ,./,
Silk Sonic is everything from now on. I love you all. Your songs just get better. Your choreography is on! The vocals are crisp and clean. Silk Sonic is perfection!
This dude never fails my Playlist

They are destined to be together. This is amazing!
How did they mess this up so bad?!   “But I was wroooong cause she beloooong *to these streets* woooo”   HOWD THEY MISS THIS OBVIOUS LINE?! Amazing song but im disappointed!
Yessss Lawwwd . Bringing that old SKOOL back 😍😘🙏🏾♥️
Y’all music gonna be the reason I end up with 5 kids
Whoever this is woman is... I hope she's doing well 😂
this make me wanna smoke even though i dont smoke🤣🥰
I m worry about Bruno,s figure, he is so so thin, thin, what happen, to you Bruño?
This really my shit. The vibes, the soul , the energy
What girl pissed off Bruno Mars
Maravilhosossss sou MT cadelinha do Bruno
After long time a good song
I am getting some Ashanti's - Rain on me and that Oh No part- Jay -z ft Pharrell - Allure! I love this song...listening to it makes my skin conductance be like that of freshly woven silk and my hair of a fully combed out fro...
geniuses
It’s insane how good these songs are
Imagine this song was released in 2010 😁
omg this is so good and FUNNY at the same time.  Love it.
Just AWESOME!  I am loving every bit of Silk Sonic
......this is a whole thing.  I gotta say 😂😳❤️
Beautiful SOUL POWER MUSIC!!! 😍🌟
Oh my good
I just love this vibe. I have been listening to 60's and 70's music and I absolutely love these songs. New oldies <3 Thank you for making music like this.
Filho de Michael Jackson.
This shit is so hilarious 😂
Que buena Rola
One more song that I'll listen until learn all the lyrics
To all of my brothers, and sisters in the music industry take notes.  I like Bruno Mars, but notice how he's becoming popular by doing black music.  He was doing alternative pop, but was struggling.  Now, doing black music he's becoming popular.  Stop giving away our magic.
this song is an instant banger… like, it’s one thing when Future said a long time ago “she belongs to the streets” but now this song just elevated that point. It be crazy how much you give to somebody that you love, and yet no matter what you do for that individual, you still end up being by yourself cause everybody nowadays just wanna fuck around. Some of y’all got that community service going on 😂
this man Anderson died and came back to life 😂😂😂😂😂
Love this old school shit hell yes bring it all back .
1:45 WHY IS HE ON THE FLOOR LIKE THAT🤣
I am not of the usual age group to listen or comment on this site, but boy what an amazing sound reminds me of the fantastic groups of the 70s. I have even downloaded it. Absolutely brilliant.
Future would be proud.
Pure Love!!!
This is the new returning from simpin anthem
This is absolutely brilliant. The combined sound of Motown and Philly with modern lyrics, sublime.
This shit is Fire 🔥 🔥🔥. Vocals, beat and lyrics are insane
https://youtu.be/mls4SBIcTxU
😍😍
"This bitch" ... always gets me😂❤️
The dislikes are from the girls walking barefoot on the streets!🤣🤣🤣
I don't like nowadays music. I like this. This is classic.
thank Gawd for this return to real, multidimensional soul. may it never ever end
1:43 when ur teammates dies but then you revive him
They are enjoying it more than us
Two days, 10M views and counting. It's already my favorite song of the year.
i need Frank Ocean to join Silk Sonic asap
Great song
Wow nice  song
Perfect 👌
“Simpin ain’t pimpin baby” the song
I want this to blow up because this song is amazing!!!
Is that Bruno on the drums?
Perfect voices! Just amazing
Clean and smooth!
Bruno Mars is mad
almost 10 million views in less than 3 days so far! well deserved, you guys are awesome together
Next to “Real Talk”, this is the next best most comical, authentic, realistic jam I’ve ever heard! For all you guys out there, don’t laugh too hard. You better listen!!! The genuine man’s heart must be cherished, Ladies🤔🤔
Jesse Pinkman approves!
Uhm, why she gotta be a b*tch? Chick would work just as well. (Smokey told Anderson about misogynistic lyrics.) PS Bruno, you said "that's how you like it...Take your wallet!" She understood the assignment.
They speaking facts though
Bruno is done. He done closed the damn door and changed the dam lock and threw the grenade back 😫😂
Wow a dose of energy to complete the evening fun weI love you 🤟:))
😭😭This bitch got my boy ready to throw that grenade he caught right tf back
🔥🔥💖💖💪🏽💪🏽
So good!
How is it that every element in this song is just so great, like how is that humanly possible? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🥲🥲🥲🥲 I just want the damn album

Wonder if Duggy is no longer part of Bruno's Hooligans.  He used to be a 2nd keyboardist or played another instrument when he wasn't needed on sax.  Hope he hasn't suddenly left the band like Philip did. 🙏🙏🙏
I love you so much Bruno ❤️❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋💋

.............To deceivers, enemies of Christ 😡😤A fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.😡😤 Jer 15:14
God treats everyone on the same basis. 35 Those who fear Him and do what is right are acceptable to Him, no matter what race they belong to. Acts13:41 Look, you Scoffers! Be astonished and die! For what I am doing today is something that you will not believe, even when someone explains it to you! So that all the world may be saved. God punishes them, because what can be known about God is plain to them, for God Himself made it plain.20 Ever since God created the world, His invisible qualities, both His eternal power and His divine nature, have been clearly seen; they are perceived in the things that God has made. For God will reward each of us according to what we have done.
❤️❤️❤️The Beautiful Wife💓💓 . . The head of Jesus is God the Father, the head of man is Jesus Christ, the head of woman is men. When Jesus Christ is the head of the husband his wife shall reverence him and her husband shall praise and honor her ❤💃... It is written. . She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and deliver-eth girdles onto the merchants. 25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. 26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. 27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. 28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. 29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellent them all. 30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 31 Give her of the fruits of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates. ~Proverbs 31:24 By Kings with LOVE~
“Being humble does not mean that you are depressed, but that you are humbling yourself for the sake of others. You reduce yourself from your original position just to bless somebody else. That’s not easy, when the flesh is full of pride, because pride desires promotion, to be seen, and to show off. Humility is the opposite. Humility teaches you to voluntarily abase yourself.” ~David E. Taylor~  “...he that shall humble himself shall be exalted” (Matthew 23:12)
( If you can get offended, you can be a traitor.)  Jesus says, If you have ought against your brother go to him and him alone.  Jesus says, If you are offended by your brother go to him and him alone.  You got to get to the point where nothing can offend you. If nothing can offend you, you can't betray.  https://youtu.be/348i6U0LLLo
As amazing as this song is, if you replace "belongs to everybody" with "belongs to the streets", it would be even better
Harmonizing so good

A masterpiece. These guys have gone to a level that will be hard for them to come back from. This record is a proud moment for them. I haven’t laughed and smiled at a record in a long time. Beautiful. This is what the world needs right now. #RealMusic

".. But I also hope, that your triflin' ass is walkin round barefoot in these streets." So much in this song/video is just perfectly ridiculous. The visuals add so much to the song
Timeless music

70's ...very nice.
For some reason? Paak popping up on the screen remind me an iconic scene in Half Baked where Snoop appeared from the floor and snatched old boy joint for a 1 hit gone...
Oh so we have  Versace on the FLOOR,  Leave the DOOR open and  Smokin out the WINDOW.   What's next?
They wanna be The Temptations and Jackson 5 so bad. They still aint better than them tho. Good song tho

I like the 70’s vibe. 👑👑
This is absolutely the most fire song of 2021 , again Bruno hit the mark for the pumps , players, hookers , hustlers and squares
My life is completely fucked up! I fear that glorious future will never happen.
Why the hell haven't I heard about this Bruno before.  I've missed all the fun of my life  and the suspense of waiting for a new single or album to come out. I feel I am alive again. Bruno... YOU ARE TOOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
Amazing
So basically she belongs to the streets right ?
WOW <3
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I want to come to a concert!! I have way too many soul train outfits that I don’t want to go to waste..

Door✅ Window✅ Next:? Maybe chimney LOL
Silk sonic can do no wrong 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Nah Chris Brown need to get on this one 🔥🔥
Everything about this is perfect from an artistic and stylistic perspective, shot composition, camera quality and film techniques, lighting, costume and set design and I don’t even need to mention the musical style and performance. Elated this exists.
"This bitch" hits so hard 🤣🤣🤣
AND HOW BIG IS THE CITY
Love Them!

Perú 🇦🇹🎶

Dam this album is going to have nothing but number one's on it!
Retro and modern combined #Fabulous
I love Silk Sonic they can do no wrong
I love your humor :) And Bruno's smocking is the only amateur looking thing here, which only makes the whole thing better.
Wow! Fantastic.  Absolutely Fantastic 💯

Cheese (Woah, woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  [Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars] This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak] Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody
❤️❤️❤️
Anderson went to sleep 💀
I see Paak with the Womack shades 😎

I feel bad for the people who didn’t know paak before silk sonic😭
That's the most gentlemanly way of saying "she belongs to the streets" I ever heard

Produced by Will Smith. ✅✅✅
Ain’t nobody gone talk about how Bruno hit that high note at the end of the song
For all the Gold diggies out there..! ❤😘✌🏼🏆🍾😘❤
At some point, a man should know what he accepts in life, a builder or a bullshitter, real talk, regardless how fine as wine she maybe.😀🤣🥰😇
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👌🏽brilliance
Got them AGT stars in the back
EXECENTE MUSICA , ME ENCANTA ¡¡¡¡
I don’t know about y’all but Bruno said “this BITCH” with some experience behind the statement 😂😂😂 who made Bruno upset
I pictured Eddie Murphy’s Mama Klump from Nutty Professor singing the “Hercules” part.
Who's on the floor? 😂😂
The way Anderson was dramatically laying on the floor only to hop back up and continue to sing 😂❤️‼️ this duo is amazing together I hope they make a couple of albums together ❤️
8.4K people from the city disliked this song cause they don't want her either 🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 they got it
Bruno's channeling Sammy Davis Jr. on this album.  Love it!
Would be good except for the smoking part. Normalizing smoking is never okay. Kids will think this is okay.
SUGAR DADDY'S SONG ANTHEM !!
Will Smith needs to dedicate this to Jada at their next anniversary
Bruno took a grenade for that girl now look at him 😂😂
I have been hollering thru the whole thing. Good video😊😊😊😊
Bruno Mars refues to move on with time. He still in the 80s and 90s music time! Loved it! Best from Tanzania, East Africa!
This makes today's R&B sound so repetitive and trashy. Oops!😮🤭
Dis 💩 is just dope..... Hands down
Just dont stop makin songs bruno!!!!!!
Que homem🤎
If you put a gun to my head and  made me choose the better singer, I literally couldn't. Perfect group, and every track is a smash
These two never disappoint! Just take my money whenever they do a tour!!
soul never dies
Theses Kidz got me smoking in the house 😂😂😂
The music they make together is magic 💓❤️💓
This song just makes me scream “Hercules!”
🇧🇷
THESE LYRICS WERE SO FUCKIN HILARIOUS GOD I LOVE SILK SONIC

Nothing but hits this man brings to the table 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is SOOO Awesome.  It's really got that 70s Soul Train vibe going on.
Thank you for this old school feeling masterpiece!!! This Bitch!!!
These guys are like Dj Khaled, ANOTHER ONE💯🔥😁 ...They 🌬💨
Se perderam no cigarro. Ficou ridículo.  Os deslaik é  só pelo cigarro
Love this hell yeah!!!
They bringing the smooth sound with a bit of pimpin
This combination giving back some Bobby Womack type of vibe and music......awesome to hear this in 2021
Good, that's good to gear !!!
Damn, this is good.
the way they say bitch is so addicting help me
wonder girls men version 😂
Love it🎯🎯🎯🎯
There's lots of little touches in this that amuse me.  When Anderson first comes in "this bitch" and he punctuates his point by pointing his cigarette at the camera in between swishing it around artistically, it's very funny to me
Just love you all sending love from Trinidad and Tobago 🥰
bruno mars isn't out of the window when he take the smoke
LMAO when Anderson passed out 1:43
I don’t listen to a lot of Bruno put this went wayy too hard 🔥
It's Bruno Mars FINALLY getting an actual verse in the song for me🥴🤣🤣
I though he was gonna say this b got me f'd up! Lol. This song is genius!
This video right hear. 🔥
HERCULESSSSSSSSSSS 😍 I love y'all
this duo just gets better and better with every new release
🇻🇪🤝🏻
Women are not property. Don't fall her a bitch. Just let her go if she's not making you happy
When they jump in front of the camera an say THIS BITCCH GOT ME PAYING HER RENT had me weak...lmfao 🤣 🤣 🤣

Bruno threw the grenade back
I love their voices but not the song 😪👎
This is my new shit right here.
This is my new favorite song😂🥰
These dudes bringing that 70s classic 'no my brother, you got to buy your own' soul to modern times... Watching this took me back to noon on Saturdays and watching the opening act on Soul Train
Yo what girl got Bruno fucked up
Dope
I keep rewatching homeboy on the ground laid out hahaha it is so random and funny!!!
Blazin’ Blasians!
Silk Sonic 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What 5K is disliking 👎 this???
Firstly Like then listen
Bootsy narrating the intro!
Before : Leave The Door Open After : Smokin Out The Window
No smoking
Bro. Love it.
Oooo yah 😎 I liked this ❤️
Bruno threw the grenade back.
https://youtu.be/T-ajHVsMcKk
This bissh got me paying her rent, paying for trips , diamonds on her neck and MIA, too funny.I see he stepped it up a notch.
Wow !! Old school high performance
This 70s/80s vibe is awesome!  very very good.  I'm really grateful to see two guys doing great music the ballads or Soul music is wonderful!  God Bless Silk Sonic, Bruno and Anderson.  Very good musical work.  I love you guys.  Lots of luck, health and prosperity for you 🍀😘🥰👍🤙💖👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏾🕺🏾❤️‍🔥🎶🎶🇧🇷Brazil and 🇵🇹Portugal love you……you are the cherry 🍒 on the 🔝cake wonderful!
Looks great in 480p!
1:42 Paak dramatically laying on the floor. 1:50 Him shooting back up to the camera to take the lead again. This sent me! 😂😂😂
That slow drop to their knees at the end was amazing. A lotta leg muscles in play just to do that.
Adele and Bruno are coming out with an album. Things are finally looking up 😂
Anderson lying 'dead' on the floor...then a few seconds later jumping into frame to sing his verse. I can't breathe!! 🤣🤣🤣
Hilarious. I know there are songs for the brokenhearted but this is gotta be the first for the bitter hearted. Though I think I love the girl he's singing about.
2012: Natalie (unorthodox jukebox) 2021: Smokin Out The Window
Mending bagi sini dah rokoknya daripada gak disedot
I’m gonna come here often 🥰
Jackson 5
Silky smooth!
YES
That Big Teeth Bastard Anderson and Little Appropriating Prick Bruno are an amazing combination…
Anderson .Paak is cracking me up the whole time haha
Reminiscing the good ol days
So 70's ..... Like Barry White!!!
The song is dry.  No juice in it.
Some girl got Bruno all the way fucked up
Seriously though, Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak got me feeling something I have never felt before with any other duo
Bruno Mars could sing a song about dog shit and make it sound great
Hahah nice one 🔥 🔥 🔥
Every song keeps getting better and better
They doing the damn thing! Love it
Pure class ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow this is insane!
Bitches are expendable homies are forever
I wish they'd stop calling women bitch3s
"she belongs to the street"
Not impressed with this female bashing song.  Bruno you're too talented to be singing about "bitch" anything...you threw that word in during your 24K magic days.  I wondered why then, and you're back with it again...where is the growth and I'm asking why again.  I don't hear you doing male bashing songs - and I'm not suggesting you should because neither direction would be good...Who or what are you appealing to with this song?  Disappointed.
The album is not even out but it surely deserves the grammy
They so damn stupid 🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 this song is hilarious 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love it
Funk universe right here
These guys are just having so much fun using retro/ old school style music and making hits (and money) out of it. Bruno Mars has been doing this for a long time now and it always works.
He died and came back!!! 😂😂😂 I love this.
I am ready to stand FRONT and CENTER at a Silk Sonic concert, and fangirl like my whole life depends on it! SO ready for tour!!! 😭😭🙌🏾
The Chuck E. Cheese line proper took me out!! 💀
Love it♥️
This is my favorite song 😆😂🤣
Glad that TikTok recommended it. It sound so good their voices are amazing I'm smiling the whole time.
Anderson Paak. Dying for 5 secs was hilarious.
Perfect match 🤩
Bruno literally cannot make anything that’s not FIRE🔥🔥🔥 WOW
This is comical but at same time cud be relatable lol it’s an interesting jam!!
Bout time it’s #1
브루노마스 사랑해
So this is the Smooth version of saying "She Belong to the streets"? Lol
Addicted to you guys..
btches, listen to this~!!
The energy 🕺🏾⚡️🌟
Yeas finally a real hit song
I just love how Anderson .Paak just die at 1:44
Increíble, Brunito Mars sin decepcionarme!!
Love it but not a fan of anyone calling a woman a b*tch
He threw the grenade back
Bruno bringing back that oldskool flava for real
Paying her  rent paying for trips 😂😂😉😉😂😂
Another grammy
mirip muka ku
Wait, y'all! I had to play that back!!! AHhhhhhh!!!
Os melhores do planeta que som pesado show de bola
They are making music that my daughter could play for my grandma! What I'm trying to say is it Timeless!!!
That guy who spoils women with jewelry, trips or financial support exists only on the songs, OR I've just found cheap trash dudes in my entire life. The last one did not even take me out for an ice cream. I quitted. Being single has been the best choice.
Love ❤️ thanks 🙏 much
VeryGood

Bruno went from "catch a grenade for u" to "throw a grenade at you"
Frikiii
that 4.5K dislikes is a gossip gang
This song is amazing
Song: Melody is superb, it was like made for making love. Lyrics: About a fvcking bitch  HAHAHAHAHA
I'mma need the ladies of smooth soul to come out with a clapback.🥰😂🥰
In thos song, that any woman would tale advantage of that. Because I would be taking care of you as good as you are me. Just sayin. You are so gorgeous Bruno and your voice is  sooo sexy and hot!!!❤❤❤
Bruno you are sexiest man alive and have the most beautiful sexy voice om the Earth. I just don't like the woman being called a bitch in the song. And 100% of women could only dream of being taken care of and pampered like y'all are to your women, so I can't believe y'all
Ngl gotta give the back up singers a BIG Big up for failing to disappoint

Damn LIVE w/ Cigarette on your hands so dope!!
This song remind me of sanji and his cigarette ONE PIECE , this song can be relate to him 🤣🤣 is there any one piece fan...
2020s jackson five
Man, dem boys is good!
This is my new favorite song.
I like Silk Sonic, but I can't help but feel like "Leave the Door Open" "Skate" and "Smokin Out the Window" are the new "Crazy" "Cryin" and "Amazing." If you catch my drift.
What happen with Bruno with The hooligans?..no more colab? And his best friend , Phil?
Sugar Daddy Anthem..
Another magnificient song from these people!!!!!!!!
There’s crack in every song they sing. THEY ARE ADDICTING
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
🔥🔥🔥
“This bitch” 2021 and “men” are still referring to women like this?!!?
This is such good. Everyone will know this song in 20 years
I heard only 5 seconds of it and liked this bopppppppp🤩
ini mah...mirip2 ama yang kemarin yak
Masterpiece
The girl is just so rude he spend 40k
Smoking out? Smoking HOT!!!
I love this 🔥🔥🔥
The real music are back
Already liked the video before playing lol
yum
Anderson’s backing vocals just brings SILK to Bruno’s SONIC!
Anyone who dislike this song is like positive on COVID. Didn't have a taste. 😂
NECESITO EL ALBUM YA y tambien una cancion de NAVIDAD con esta tematica vintage
The set gives me “Dancing Machine” vibes😎
The combination of bruno and paak...is worth to be continued...the result incredible
I can't stop vibing with this song. Myghad!
He threw the grenade back and shut the F-ing door :)))))) Now he's talking shiet about her to the moon :)))
they left the door open.... of course they're so cold.
aduh..aduh lagu ini kok keren bangeeet
Performance 1009
I absolutely love this!❤️❤️
Awesome song
these boys giving out TEMPTATIONS VIBES
Ohhh, it's too cold - too cold. Andreson, Bruno, Silk Sonic; Bringing it and Killin The Ol' Skool Game!!!
Time traveller in 1980's:  *Sneezes  The Timeline:
I just wanna say thank you to this group of gentleman for creating new art that emulates and honors the style of past legends
Bruno let anderson sing
The play dead 👌
Chuck-E-Cheese, X-MEN, UFC!? Really!? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️
Smooth 🥂
Love Silk Sonic.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Solid Gold!
Their chemistry way better then Big mama n her Kitchen coz they cookin for real for real
Man really showing his Spanish roots now
oh lord , king of pop coming ❤️❤️❤️
absolute garbage just like every other bruno mars song (the guy in the video with the hat has a good voice he could go far)
Offensive
Big Tobacco pretty happy here lol
I'm tired of Bruno Mars. All he ever does is rip off black music and black artist, pretending to be black,  and black people just keep inviting him to the cookout.
Dawg Bruno the goat fr 💀🐐
“Look here baby I hope that you find whatever it is that you need. But I also hope that your trifling ass is walking ‘round here barefoot in these streets.” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruno Mars Finally Closed the Door 😭. Got my man smoking a cigarette....he's stressing
Este es otro nivel muy bueno pero la verdad no creo que supere el éxito del disco pasado, tendremos que esperar otros 3 años para ver si regresa al estilo qué lo caracterizó
This is the most entertaining video and song ever my new favorite
The cigarettes'.
such a vibe
GAT DAMN!
INCREDIBLE sound. Love what they're doing. This is real OLD SCHOOL
i need a smoke..
So good
Amazing Cool MV ! But this won't be welcome in Japan, because of smoking🚬
Man, where would Bruno be without Black culture 🤷🏽‍♀️
The smoothest way to say "she belongs to the street"
1:33
I went to your concert in 2018 in Sydney, Australia. BEST. CONCERT. IVE. BEEN. TO.
All I could think of was PJ Washington 🤣. Great song
Finally. City Boyz up 1 mil
Anderson pak is that dude!
These two keep cranking out hits. The throwback smoothness is strong.
hey guys, remember when we all thought old school and disco is coming back?  i-....i think it's back...
Lol, the "Simp National Anthem"
They really bringing that music back
Does anybody know the genre of this song ?  It sounds really catchy
Wow, never heard of silk sonics, not a fan of mars, converted
This song spoke to my heart
My idol bruno
I don't know why,but I'm waiting for Gladys Knight to enter. 😅🔥🔥🔥
What's the point? The hype over the 1st single was not taken advantage of. The waited forever to release a second single or a album. Sales will not be what they should be. But I must say....this song is way better than that "Skate" song.
🏆⭐🇺🇲
🏆⭐🇺🇲
I’ll be in pain everyday I have to wait for this album
Why he snap like this 😩😩😩
👍👍
Flawless ..
🔥🔥🔥
Silk Sonic needs the bass to complete the masterpiece    Hmu
This got the same vibe as bills bills bills.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCpuwLUfuZhJsJN7D0ajHWOA
just checking in to see how many subs I could possibly get from this comment 🙂
1.45 minute its my fav part !! HAHAHA! KING BRUNO!!
Earth, Wind and Fire vibes!
Incredible talents in Bruno, Anderson and the group.  Love their music.  Sad to me that they would be playing a losing lottery with smoking in real life.  They have accomplished so much, been given so many gifts, and yet think they can escape the effects of smoking cigarettes.  In our day and age, they should know better.  No excuse.   Figure out a different way to deal with your stress.  Be cognizant of all the young people you are influencing.
Bruno & Anderson were born to make these wonderful songs together
Anderson on the floor had me lmfao..didn’t expect that😂😂😂😂
Amazing!!!!!! Simply!!!!!
i love them together they're so goofy 😂 had anderson paak lying on the floor 😂😂
I love the camera and lighting editing
This is gone be the greatest album of ALL TIME! Yes I said it. Coz how the fuck else are we gone rate the genius of these men? Like how tf is this gone be anything else other than GREAT. And if you hate or dislike this you tasteless af. Thank You Bruno and Anderson and of course Bootsy. A Masterpiece in my time! Am gone loose my fucking mind on the Nov 12th.
Bruno dropping music every few months like as giving dose to addict😏
Can feel every Singaporean smokers cringing right now when they just let it burn...
Hood translation- these hoes for everybody
Bruno mars is on another level
Silk Sonic are meant to entertain and we are meant to observe. Stage presence is undeniable!
I was Don Ho's bassist for 16 years and I remember Bruno coming into the show a few times when he was about 6 or 7 years old and doing his Michael Jackson and/or Elvis routine and would have the crowd going crazy.  Look at him now...incredible.  All the best to Bruno. 🤙🏽
Boa camarada!
Never fail!👍
1:43 PAAK ON THE FLOOR 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 1:36 - Which one y’all pissed Bruno off 😂
WHERES 👏THE 👏DAMN 👏ALBUM?👏🙄
Anderson: "Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die"  Also Anderson: 1:43
Okay so cute. Pick right the next time.🎶🎶🎶🤯🤩😘😂
The beat reminds me a bit of 50 Cent-Amusement Park
great song gold bruno
.    . . . . .
カッコいい！クスッとくるし、最高！
A legend.
This song really fit wats going on in these streets 😩😩😩
love it.
진짜 미쳤다....80년대 느낌 예술로 살렸네 ㅎㅎㅎ
His rich songs just kill it everytime.
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender and so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  [Verse 1: Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, & Both] Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah, woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  [Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars] This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak] Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody   [Verse 2: Anderson .Paak] Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me, please (Help me, please, help me, please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  [Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars] This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak] Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How?) (How could you do this to me?) Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (One things fasho, one things fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong to) Yeah, she belong to everybody That girl there, she belong to everybody  [Interlude: Anderson .Paak] (Oh, no) Look here, baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But, I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round bare foot in these streets Look out

Bruno de mi corazón I love you with the intensity of a thousand suns. No soy de tu generación y moriré diciendo que haces magia con la música 💟✨💋
This is giving me some Temptations vibes and i love it
I'M LATE BUT NOW I'M HERE MARS
Oh yes.  Good music... finally!!! THANK YOU & PLEASE DON'T STOP!!!
the music like the music .
Why Bruno got that wife beater ass mustache 😫
Holy shitnuggets! Are we going back to the real RnB? They should include Joe for a feature.
Aye, such a nice groove wif this Jam😇🎵💜
This is a great song to just vibe and ride down the highway💖🎶💖
Best performance video ever
So this is what Russell Wilson has been up to since his "injury"🤨
This whole album and everything they touch will be a number 1 song they will be one of the most successful groups in history I’m calling it now waiting on their stars and all the accolades and concerts to come can’t wait
I like Anderson Paak's singing more than his rappin lol
reminds me of how Christina Aguilera's Back to Basics and how that honored the great and the 20s 30s 40s jazz funk era
I’m so proud to be a teenager while Bruno and Silk Sonic is bringing back old school music in 2021.
If Gamble and Huff were still around today, this is the kind of music they would be making.
https://youtube.com/shorts/DVpSLtt2eoc?feature=share
Pqp esse Bruno Mars canta muito e esse estilo é top demais . N tem pra ninguém 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Bruno is keeping the oldies alive
Why can't I stop laughing at this!?!?
Great shit
Just vibe
🎶girl how could you do this to him?? 😩
Oh my lord....that's a tune.
1:19
is this song for gold diggers? just askin......
Bruh," not to be dramatic but I wanna die." How he pops back up! Nearly pissed myself 😆
THIS MAN'S MUSIC IS PURE MAGIC... #every #damn #time
Anderson + bruno is like a dream... Can't wait the full album!
They way Paak was just lying there lmaaooooo
Solid for me 😍
THIS SONG
To hot call the fireman 💥wow 🔥
Another mega hits🌝
The perfect duos 💯💯🔥🔥🔥
This song makes make wanna smoke a whole pack of John Kelabu !
After watching the video several times, it makes me wonder how many times they had to smoke while filming XD
Paak just laid out on the floor is sending me 🤣
Damn, I love park and Mars and this album is going to be good but nothing comes even close to leave the door open.
let me count...  by show of hands, "This B***h got me paying her rent"....
OMG, I adjust love them together! They are simply 🔥.  I hate smoking though. It’s not cool.  I can’t wait for an album. Stick with the 70s theme and drop that double album with a pop up on the inside cover.
The lyrics are hilarious 😂
It's the dramatic fall, then pop up singing like nothing happened. Oh that was hilarious.
vibes
Reminds me of old days Bruno mars ...on repeat...
You can tell that these two we’re heavily influenced by Michael Jackson and James Brown
hot la yunk 🌹🌹🌹
Nuevo tono de llamada
AHHHHH
Jesus this is so refreshing to hear something different in this day and age
ANDERSON NEVA MISSES
Bruno went from “I’ll catch a grenade for you” to “I’ll throw a grenade for you”
So it’s clear by all these comments  that everyone misses good music ❤️
This feels like an snl skit hahaha... All love tho x
Grown folks music! 😍🥰

lagu bruno kalo pertama kali denger b aja,tapi kalo udh 2-3x denger itu ko jd enak banget?
That say “ gotta give her back to the streets! “
sooo fresh! sweet melody 😌
Finally have a legendary “she for the streets” Anthem.
Grandi!
Bruh what do you even say like... I love this niggas 😂😂😂😂😂
cute
The most ratchet Motown song ever, I’m here for it.
They are freakin hilarious together🤣🤣

Paak killed this shit.
Me:" Buy me the candy" Mom:" sorry hun, I don't have mon...... " Me:  1:36
when you fell in love with a gold digger
Christ, props to everyone on the set doing all that amidst all that smoke. I’m a smoker myself but even this looks like too much.
良すぎて困惑ｗｗｗ

"This bitch got me paying her rent" that LINE
I love his music ok taking us old school here reminds u of Jackson 5 💞

"This bitch"... Watch the memes...mark my words
Great song again 😙😙😙
Anyone else get chills head to toe when hearing Bruno's high notes towards the end?? Just me? HANDS DOWN BEST VOCALS!!!

Ik Motown and 60’s-70’s groups are happy they are bringing the sound back.
Smoking out the weed now
Sound very similar to the song comedy of lonely island (with Justin Timberlake) d..k in a box
All Silk Sonic songs sound like classics 🎵
AAAAAA

The Jackson 5

"Smokin Out The Window"  Wait a minute, this love started out so timid and so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could you do this to me?" (How could you do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookoin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to sound dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  Smokin' out the window Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the benzo Singin' "How could you do this to me?" (How) "How could you do this to me?" I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody Yeah she belonged to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round dead in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you're not here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could you do this to me?" (How) "How could you do this to me?" I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody Yeah, she belonged to everybody Ooh
70s music with a 2021 mindset
If you aren’t my favorite… I don’t know music… or myself…
sweet!
Bruno ers un encanto, todos lo son 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭👏🏽👏🏽
this is my first time listening to these guys! and i had to react to it! straight banger!!!!!
This is groovy
If this song is not on GTA 6  I'm throwing the game away
All Anderson needed is the chalk outline!! 11/10 performance 🤣🤣💯
I LOVE THEM!!!!❤❤❤
If even Bruno singing about how she belongs to the skreets you know it’s true! 🥶 Winter is coming!
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
😭😭😭😭💘
Y hacerme tan feliz
Gracias x existir
TE AMOOOO BRUNO MARS
The melody is so fantastic and they are very talented..
Timeless  Greetings from 2k21 To 2050
I'm so worried about the mic cords and Anderson not getting tangled hahaha😂
This is a HIT for sure!!!!!
This is a BOUNCE🎼🎵🎶🍃💙🍃😎
What I love is the old school vibe, but not them calling the gurl a B... that ruined the song for me. Barry white would never.
Where is the Album.... where is....the....okay I'll wait....but I don't think I can manage to hold the anticipation any longer.....🤭🤭🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯😁😁💯💯
What I love about silk sonic is their music is just so fun. "you smell better than a barbecue:'  "I won't  bite, unless you like" and now this "not to be dramatic, but I wanna die" XD You can tell these guys are just  having a blast.
Goddamn this album is already a classic and it hasn’t even dropped yet
Bruno went from catching grenades, to pulling out the pin and throwing them 😂 Manz is fed uppppp
How can a song be so smooth yet so hilarious!
They really stressed out the entire song
How am I jus hearing this fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mais música de Bruno mars eu Só queria ver
Y'all know y'all wrong for this song and video 🤣
I need a CeeLo Green remix already
The music is excellent but the lyrics need to be improved
Fuuuuuckkkk why is Bruno so damn fine
Suka bgt sama lagunyaaa <3
Wow, it feels like music was remade again. It's like a rebirth of good music
Owoww
This is incredible!
This music is just pure art
LOVE IT! Am I the only one tht hears this sounds like a remake or cover of Jackson 5 “never can say goodbye”??! Lol ❤️❤️❤️
Now imma need a females version because no 😳😂😂😂😂😂🤭😂😂😂🤭🥴

Legends!
Anderson Paak looking like a dead GTA NPC
gostei mano
I just pray to God it isn’t drugs, I’ve never seen Bruno look like this. Huge fan of his music and wouldn’t want to see him go down the horrible path of most talented musicians.
THIS SHIT HARD!!😂😂🔥🔥🔥
JUST WOW!!!! NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE THIS. ALL SYNCHRONIZED,THE SONG, UNIVERSE, MELODIES AND THEM.JUST WOW WOW WOW.
SO PERFECT!!! I LOVE YOU BRUNO <3
OH MY GOD!!!! You guys ❤❤ LOVE!!!! Can't wait for the album 🙌🏻
Lmaoooo the way Anderson was just laid out on the floor and then popped back up in the camera
🐐🐐🐐🐐🔥🔥🔥
Silk sonic never ceases to amaze me
Imagining showing this to Bach
Anderson .Paak is THE GOAT!!! I NEED THAT NEW ALBUM!!!!
I had to do a double take on Anderson Paak cause I thought for a sec that he was Dave Chappelle
Anderson Paak cussing 😂
Do you pronounce the "." in Paak?
They LITERALLY SAID..... Feelas  ..... WE AIN'T FORGOT YOU... here's your anthem
Really glad Anderson Paak wasn’t just backups, he’s so fucking talented
Damn, I can only imagine the musical pleasure the musicians must feel just jammin out to this pure unadulterated song. 🎶🎵
💀 Bruno is done. He done closed the damn door 🚪 😂😂😂😂
Bruno Mars en el show de las estrellas, los de Colombia saben a qué me refiero.
The infliction when they said this bitch. They are really going through it  😂
Lol
Flawless 🕺✨
😂 all the ladies viben to Summer Walker and Silk Sonic……. Need I say more
Someone had to make this dude mad ain't no way💀
I’m so delusional about Bruno being my husband that I believe every time he makes a song, it’s about me ☹️. And I ain’t fa everybody 🏃🏻‍♀️
This is gonna be one of those albums you listen to forever, it's never gonna get old or over played...there aren't many in that category. Bruno Mars has been at the top of my concert list for years, but if these guys tour together, I'm gonna make it happen. I don't care how much it cost!
Temon !!!!
Thissssss bitch got me….YESSSS IM HERE FOR IT BRUNO!!! 🔥🔥🔥
*Keep going mars❤*
I miss bruno writing about his heart break. Can somebody please broke his heart again so I can hear another legendary song. Like when I was your man
Hoodville Blues
Bruno..you're one of the greats and other singers will follow your lead..feel so old saying this but there are many synonyms for the word bitch..
hit
it lke treasure
Why Copyright!
bruno really threw that grenade back
THIS IS SOOO FUNYY
Lol love this video
M A S T E R P I E C E
I am calling 1970s vibe 🙌🏽🙌🏽
bruno dun caught too many grenades he fed up now
Best art of 2021
Old school 🎙️📻 with a Bitch 💯
Man he threw that grenade back
r u kidding me!!!! all the little moments!!!!
Love this..did you have to say "bitch "?
Anderson  and them Bobby Womack shades make his part hit tougher.
He threw the grenade back
I can hear Taehyung singing this 💜
STUDIO3121...Bruno could sing the Pledge of Allegiance, and it would be a HIT!!
shit , iba talaga pag pinoy❤️ every genre fits bruno mars and I'm loving the retro vibe❤️
Truth have been spoken
It's a Winner.
Immaculate 🔥🔥❤️
they really don’t miss
Bruh. This is soooo goood 🔥🔥🎶🎧
Alguien aquí que hable español y le encante la canción 😄👍🇨🇴❤️
1:43 "OH MY GOD, THEY KILLED ANDERSON! U BASTARDS!!"  1:52 "HEY LOOK, ANDERSON'S OKAY!" 😂😂😂
Its hard to like to like this song.. It’s ok but nothing special
Whoever dislike this song need a COVID test because they don't got no taste
Just when the world needed it most, Soul returned.
she's did that too you bro because you smoke 😂,♥ you
Why there are no views to this masterpiece
Favorite
Dope
Bruno has snapped what ever bitch it is got him fucked all the way up
This is giving me a cross between the stories from “Natalie” & “Calling All My Lovelies”. Also, the drama is on point.
Bruno Mars has officially reached his ultimate inner James brown
bruno really said “give you back to the city” not even the “streets” but the whole city 🤣😭😭😭
Bruno is no longer catching grenades & jumping in front of trains for ya, after realizing you wouldn’t do the same. He’ll be leaving doors open while smokin’ out the window from now on😌 But fr I cannot wait for the albums release😩 This song is on repeat💕 Well damn TikTok stole my mf clout😮‍💨 punching the air rn
Once again another amazing song i love all u guys looking good bruno
0:32 , 1:36 ^ This b%tch got me paying her rent paying for trips diamonds on her neck diamonds on her wrist and here I am all alone🎤🎶
Bruno y Anderson se complemetan a la perfeccion , la melodía también esta muy bella🌠 La energía que transmite esta canción es alucinante❤💗
This duo is just incredible. As if they complete each other.....the sharp lyrics of Anderson and wonderful and melodious vocals of Bruno makes this album heavenly
Love the controversial cigarettes!  Keep it up!
Anderson: "Not to be dramatic" Also Anderson: (continue being dramatic)  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hittem wit’ the shoulders…. smooth as butter🙌🏽
The way way Anderson Paak sung the Bitch line was funny as hell
omggg❤️❤️
😂😂😂
A flash back ...wow.. well done guys
God damn. This is funky fresh!
So much talent!
I'm speechless....!!! OUTSTANDING.......!!!!
Bruno & Anderson/Silk Sonic does it again! This song is so smooth yet so relatable (for some, not me lol.) Nonetheless, amazing work guys!
Eles não param se superam a cada clipe a cada canção irado demais!!!! Bruno Anderson sigam sempre assim!!!
Another hit from the legends
Love it. Retro yet contemporary. I can relate  to the lyrics also. Some women are cruel
this is music born purely of passion and joy
Righteous # Righteous hashtag Righteous #Righteous
"I must have spent 30 or 40 Thousand up in Tiffany's....got her bad ass kids running around my house like it Chuckie Cheese".😂😂😂😂😂
😍✨✨💝💝💝
I'm amazed how many folks put the don't like button. Some people are just unhappy. SMH.
Capital B and everything 😭😭
This was hilarious!🤣 Im glad I seen i seen the video cause boy let me tell you😬😳..🤣🤣 We needed that until it came out!
SUCH A JAM!!!! I CANT WAIT FOR THE FULL ALBUM TO DROP
This literally just made my heart sing.  I was a little girl in the 70s, but I remember the radio being filled with fantastic R&B music like this.  So thankful that Silk Sonic has brought it back in such a magical way.  Cheers!
🤣😂🤦🏾‍♂️
The Killing part is : THIS BITCH...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love this song💕💕💕
The most polite way to call someone a "thot" lmao
i’d rewatch the entire video just to see anderson paaks bracelet sparkle
"But I also hope, your trifling ass is walking around here barefoot in these streets" 😆😆😆😂🤣😂🥰  I love ALL things Anderson Paak!!!! He's been at it for years, but most are just coming to know who he is 😍🙌🏽
Seeing this makes me happy!
That's what happens when you LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN.......DEVILS SKATE IN UNANNOUNCED   LESSON LEARNED RIGHT BRUNO
Wow, talk about turning back the clock, like 45-50 years. This is my youth right there and I’m diggin’ it !
Woow who is the girl that did all that to him so I don't try and get on with her😂
why do i feel like this song is trolling....lol
From catch a grenade for ya to throw a grenade at ya.
We love you “BRUNO’ FR.. HONOLULU OAHU HAWAII..🤟👍👏👏👏👏🤙🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Song bops
God Bless Silk Sonic. THIS IS SOME REAL MOTHER FUCKING MUSIC RIGHT HERE!🙏🏿🔥
WHEN I SAY SILK ..... Y'ALL SAY SONIC
ahh this vibes 🙈❤️
did an owl sing this
Been through this! Ole BATCH!
“But I also hope that yo trflin a** is walking round bare foot in these streets” man I felt that in deep down in my soul
I ain't gone lie. when they said this  'Cause she belongs to everybody i thought they were gonna say streets i know i ain't the only one
After they leave the door opened welcoming the girls, they enjoyed the girls more than barbeque in skate, and now the girls left.. hahah pity them. I hope they could find a true love in the next song.. Great job Silk Sonic, you are legendary!! the best thing about #SS is the robust of storyline in the lyrics.. perfect pitch!
i like the part when:
Stop smoking Bruno...you have to make best harmony of music for this cruel world.. Thanks for this masterpiece.. Love you always
Love it. Swag is unmatched
This b!+$h....🤣😅✌️
Lookout!  There they are again: Marvin Gaye, Teddy Pendergast, Issac Hayes and Al Green!  Time travel is REAL! BTW Anderson, those are MY GLASSES from 1977!  @1:37 Bruno's diction of "B" is quintessential. Brown velvet NEVER looked this good in the 70s but that Final silhouette genuflect at the end says it ALL. These guys take me right back to the day but BETTER because they're smilin' and so am I.
https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rk
🔥🔥
Really need the bloopers when they're smoking while singing 😆
1:43 paak is just dead LMFAOOOO
🔥 🔥 Bruno get the BANGERS! 🔥 🔥
This is 🔥🔥🔥
Mans threw the Grenade back💥 ,closed the door ,🚪and wished for something else than being her man to ✨kick it with the homies 🤣
❤️once again !
Okay but whose the tall background singer on the left?! 👀
Love this!, Motown 60’s! The best!
4.2k dislikes... probably these young kids that don't know any better🤣🤣 THIS IS GOOD MUSIC 💯💯
Music should not sound this good my god.
So good
"not to be dramatic but i wanna die" felt lmao
Like it’s so freaking good and groovy all their songs!
Old vibes rebornnn.
amazing song, thumbs 👍
When he said "This. Bitch." I felt that.
This group might possibly make the best music I’ve literally ever heard they are so good
wowoooowowowowow
The classiest artists around!  🙏🏽🔥
the way that he die on his own reborn  so sooo sweet a master piece of God.
I LOVE IT! Another great hit!!!!
I gotta have this CD if only for this one cut (real man )problems
Perfection
Dude was dead on the floor 😂
Not to be dramatic but lays on the floor lol
https://youtu.be/KH2WYFBWWLg
WONDER HOW MUCH TAKES DID THEY DO T KEEP THA CIGARETTE GOIN   DAMN
No one's  gonna talk about how they playing their cigarettes 😶
Getting that Earth, Wind and Fire vibe with a little bit of Maurice White and Phillip Bailey! Go ahead!
me after breakup with a joint, hearing this music mann🤤
Another one🥺🔥
this makes me flirt myself in front of the mirror 😏
Lol kids like it’s Chuck E. Cheese
Damn he really threw the grenade back.
Comedy Gold in Perfect Harmony !🤣👍🤣👍🤣
damn this some music roll have a glass....or riding in the old school or your car lol
This is a first time that I saw a glitch in a music video..
this song literally mean "she belong to the street"
who got bruno smoking tobacco ? 😭
Love the music but will not be able to watch this video a second time. I can't take my eyes off the cigarettes. Smoking gave my mother lung cancer which killed her. If you smoke please quit and save your own life.
This is everything!!!! 🥰🥰And that one hand holding the cigarette 🚬 is topping it off
How can anyone hate on this ...let alone 4k disliking this ...y'all some sad mfs lol
He done leaving the door open
Perfection
Who upset my boy
Las mejores canciones las hacen juntoooos, son tan geniales
They remind me of James Brown with the brown outfits 😅 The dramatic scenes of this song are too funny and just entertaining.
🔥 needs a Maybach music 🏷
I’m so excited for this album Bruno My Gawd! This is 🔥🔥🔥
This was heat 🔥
MOEEEE YALL BETTER GO AHEADDDD
Ooooh wow! Just awesome! Beautiful song! Mixing fun and drama in a poetic way  :-)  I think silk sonic gonna be the best seller album  of all the time. This song got 7million in day ! Its already a tube !  Mtfker!!!! Damn!!! And the same thing happened about "skate and " leave the door open". And for those 4.1k folks who unlike this video, I got two words for you :  £¢√÷^ and %$#*®©€ , that's means Peace and love . good nigth !!!  ;-)
when Paak said 'This b*tCH*' i felt that XD
I'm going to smoke out the fucking windooooooow oooh
1:51💀💀💀😭🤣🤣
I wish Bruno makes songs like Grenade, It will Rain, talking to the moon, Just the way you are, etc. Those were the days.  This Bruno is completely into punk pop kinda.. lost his original essence
👑LOVE 💕 IT 👑🤣
Yo he snapped with this track 👏👏👏
You know what’s so fucked you about them two? When the song ends it pisses me off they just  that good 😂  ok so we gonna here what happen it on the next song? 🥴
Anderson and Bruno are a perfect combination together and so compliment the music they make. Their moves are incredible !! Hoping we hear the entire album before 2025.
ถ้าออกอากาศกับ ฟรีทีวีไทย โดนเซ็นเซอร์ทั้ง MV แน่ ๆ
All the ones that don't like it are haters. Bruno Mars and the gang did their thing on this one. 👏.  I love it. 1,000,000,000 thumbs up
oh yes! after the Door, now the Window, what's next? anyway another masterpiece ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥 .... This is beyond the beyond... WoW... It's in my playlist ..
Paak did his dam thing!!🙌
she belong to everybody, that hurt
ANOTHER HIT!!! IKTR!!!!
hear me out instead of “ she belongs to everybody  “ it should’ve been “ she belongs to the streets “ 🤣🤣🤣
Smoke a black n mild to this 😎
Good lawd. Everything about this is delicious. When Anderson “dies” for a moment 😆Making smoking great again lol.
Cocaine makes the best music
What a great song and video.
Yeah this group is no joke! Smooth old school sound, Love it!
Yessssss🙌🙌🙌🙌😂😂😂😂😂 this is epic👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Just call ya self a band cuz yess lawd
All I can see now is how much he resembles Sammie Davis Jr. in this video.  Maybe it’s the cigarette.
Bruno, hijito, te ves bien flaco.
So Dope, This is the type of music that needs a CD or Album..
My guy sprawled out on the ground and then popping back into frame.  *Chef kiss * Impeccable.
Not barefoot in these streets
To me, Bruno is the new Michael Jackson. The dude is straight up an amazing entertainer.
I just can’t get enough!!! Can’t wait to hear the whole album!
This cats got it on lockdown!!💥⚡💯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruno... Who hurt you 🥺
another jam
This was straight fire 🔥 🔥🔥🔥
This is that old school skate night music 😮‍💨😮‍💨
ME ENCANTÓ BAI
This will be nostalgia.
I just can’t get enough!!! Gonna play this song for a whole month 😍😍
The suits are giving The Temptations and I love it!
I'M WITH IT!
Never been a Bruno fan. I don't know why. Today I woke up and absolutely love his music ‼️ Go figure 🤔🤣😎
I love how this song sounds so good and has a bit of comedy as well. When I saw Anderson Pakk on the floor I was dead 😂😂
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS!!

Thank you and have a nice day!
Ok three for three! The real think I am looking for is them singing live. They always take the songs to another level live versus recorded. You know what I mean...
Idk about anyone but Bruno Mars saying “bitch” is a highlight of the year
👏👏👏👏😍
Bruno Mars never misses bro, god damn
Brasil !
Wow this song got a good timing my life cheated on me 😭 I did so much 4 the lady
they are having too much fun with this project and i couldnt be happier for them
The tearful dressing originally trade because action plausibly compare given a itchy pansy. ripe, disgusted archaeology

The actually sense arthroscopically race because newsprint topologically spark across a picayune an
🔥🔥🔥 ❤️❤️❤️
i feel like Jeff Bezos be crying while listening to this
Pra mim Bruno Mars é um dos raríssimos cantores da atualidade que tem o meu respeito, pois só escuto músicas dos anos 70 e 80. 👍👋👋👋
Lol not the emphasis on “This BI$$CH” 😂😂😂 what’s the names of the background singers ?
Been waiting on this one. I waited I waited I waited I waited I waited I waited I waited I waited I waited I waited I got in line.
This give me “jimmy early” vibes from dream girls 🤣

We love you bruno your song is so great
BESTIES THID IS SO GOOD OMGGKFJUSISID
LOVE the band and the song don't get me wrong, but I wonder how much money from Big Tobacco this got...
That was smooth
This video make me feel nostalgic.
Bruno your better than this cheesy shit.
Violence was chosen when making this song  And I love it
another hit from legend
I can totally relate to spending $45,000 at some store.. and having money to buy diamonds.. and then cry about it.
OMFG I'M DEAD..    BRUNOOOOO YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY!!!! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
I’ve been listening to this all day
Ummmm this ish pimped out
How on earth do 4.1k people give this 3 minutes of a MASTERPIECE a thumbs down?!🤦🏿🤦🏿🤦🏿
GREATINGS FROM INDONESIIA
I do not get it why there are disliking this! This is a true master piece of music. This should be a 100% liked video.  No cap.
Paarl just laying on the floor is a mood
Plot twist, will smith is the ghost writer venting
Ayye this crank
Album of the year, without an album release!
Bruno is giving me Bobby DeBarge vibes
Disappointed by bruno
I just broke up with my girl so I can bang this jam real loud in da benz. Lol Love ya boo
🤣🤣🤣
*Smooth🔥🔥🔥*
Not my typical style of music but I always said Bruno can sing good af lol
“Hercules” 🕺🏽👞💥🕺🏽👞💥🕺🏽👞💥

Chief, this is it
Dope iish
O por que o cigarro? Alou ministério da saúde
Bad music. He try looks lke michael jackson
Yess I love this 😩😍
Watch this get 750 million views
I guess when Bruno and Anderson paak and silk Sonic do "Smoking out the Window" live on television for PG purposes they might want to swap out the Bitch word for Chick it'll fit in perfect
SHE BELONG TO EVERYBODYYYYYYYYY 🕺🏽
Greatest Song ever made since “Leave The Door Open” & “Skate” Can’t wait for the full album to drop 🔥💯💪🏾
yayyyyyyy💿
Bruno Mars🔥🔥🔥🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
They just cannot take a wrong step. Anderson and Bruno are just so good. This album is going to be incredible! You know a song is great when it is 3 minutes but feels like 5.
Good song. Great video, 70’s vibe. Road song.
I am going to say this now, that track list… is WAY TOO SHORT! If the rest of the songs are like LTDO, Skate and This Song, 9 songs ain’t gonna be enough!!
Miss you Bruno
This n*gga died….. I can’t
Pin this bruno:   *Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health*
2:31
I was wondering why the drummer in the back looks like Bruno, then i found out it was his brother lmao
niceee oneee
Old skool misogyny never sounded so modern..”this bitch” is not amused. 😑
Now wha got damn female got Bruno doing this?? 😭 he not jumpin infront a train for y’all anymore 🤣 nor catching a grenade
Gonna be just chill'n but my heart is broken....😅😅😅
🤯❤️
Too good🙌
Am I the only one focusing on the lengths of theirs cigarettes?
So cool, takes me back to 80-90s when the music was good. Could have done without pushing cigarette sales since they might be going down but hey ho...
1:44 Yo 🤣😂😂
888
Michael Jackson will be so proud.
Damn, I'm fucking loving this duo
😂😂
Cant believe he actually died 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So this is what my kids are gonna hear when it’s time to clean up 😌😂
brunomars YES!!
i love how it's tongue in cheek with the lyrics but the execution is like buttah.
This song starts and all I wanna do is hear Jackson 5's "Never Can Say Goodbye" instead.
One of the best collaborations to happen in music.
What a song 🥇🏆!  Gifted performers, talented voices , grandiose singers!!!! THANK YOU ALWAYS BRUNO MARS!!!! ♥️U silk sonic
好听
10/10
Amazing! I would love to see a collaboration with Thundercat.
At first it seemed like a SNL parody but then it just solid grooves. I'm dead at about 1:45 but then it just gets back solid. OMG.
OMG! This song got me laughing out loud! Soundtrack for Sugar Daddies around the world !🤣🤣 I like the sound though!
The legend goes that Bruno Mars is incapable of producing a bad song.
Instant.  Classic.
they can collab with wondergirls. heheheh
When Bruno said "THIS BITCH!!!" I felt that in my soul
This is so fucking good
1:44 We feel you Anderson
Singaru da cãrse
Why good song always short.
Just perfection. Thank you Silk Sonic! <3
No but honestly why is this a banger like this? 😂 makes me wanna grab a cig and ask this bitch why am I paying her rent and paying for trips! I just need to know miss ma’am!
They do it once again!!!! This is truly olld school greatness
I love this type of music, dance , video it’s just mesmerizing. I’m glad that new generation can experience this
70's back!!! Thanks Silk Sonic!
Loved this video!! Brought me back to my youth in the 1970s! The look, the feel,  the sound...EVERYTHING!! Bruno's voice and harmony with the others was so tight! AWESOME!!! 👍👍👍 Keep doing songs like this and you'll be pulling us 60+ yo ladies in much more often!! Though I must correct that, I haven't heard a song yet I haven't liked!! Even though I'm old, I be digging on those groove tunes for dancing my booty off! 😁😁😁😁😁💃🕺💃🕺
THE WAY HE POPS BACK UP AFTER BRUNO VERSE HAS KE DYYYING LMAO
🚬🚬🚬🚬
Damn
This shit ridin lol 😂
Daammmm...another hit...sooo good!!!! I love the way this guys are telling a whole love story, with its ups and downs, through their songs: "leave the door open" = beginning of the relationship, after the first dates, first kisses, the lovemaking, when everything is magical and beautiful, then comes "skate" = when the relationship is solid and the couple is really in love, enjoying each other, and now "smokin out the window" = the love is gone, the heartache begins and they aren't a couple anymore.....clever, to say the least.....god, I love this band!!!!! Hope they stay around for a looong time!
Jordan clarkson when not balling
Te amo te amo
I feel this song to the core of my soul lmao
Did Bruno just say he’d beat ur ex man’s ass in the octagon 😭😂😂
Great song once again! But just so you know you got a not so silky smooth typo down in your description ;)
It's like a classier version of Cee Lo Green's "Fuck You"
Y’all are too smoothe not to sing along with… big up Silk Sonic ⬆️
Dat baw really fell out😂😂😂 and came back to speak his piece after the fact💀 hot dawg yous a badd mutha (shutcho mouff)
Love🥰
LMAO anderson on the floor had me fucking HOLLERIN💀🤣
Lighting has hit the building in the form ofSilk Sonic, the beats and the music is real music this is mind blowing in every aspect, guys this is a game setter, lol it’s a wake call for the return of real music. So as to encourage other artist to top this. Therefore we we get back to music, e stead of weird sounds. Excellent work guys
When it's a whole bop doo-wop, I guess she really does belong to the streets.
4k dislike? I mean, y'all how comee
It's the this bitch part for me😂😂😂😂
I remember the 70s. Silk Sonic covered everything about the music, from the suits to the mics. What a fabulous, addictive song…again!
Love Bruno.... he always brings it.... ( not liking his look here though.. 🥴)....
Nice song 🎵👍🇹🇹🇺🇸
Hermosa rolita
THIS BIT*H!! ...Part is going on my ringtone😙🚬💨💨💨
Ready for the album release. Gonna skate and smoke all the way to the Grammy. Loving the vibe.
❤️❤️
Love you guys but Hate the bad language 😒
The triffling ass walking barefoot on the street part got me there XXDD
🥸
literally, me trying to convince my selfish cat I'm a human with feelings.
Like 👑👑😍😍❤️❤️❤️🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🚀🚀
Love love lovvvvveee it!!
Pure gold
This whole music video had me weak on floor laughing 😂!! I’m like Damn who broke their heart for them to say “B****” so hard 🤣🤣🤣
what a cheap video,  his label knows that his music flopped, and that he won't sell more than 2,000 copies
The Best day of my life when she said GET OUT !! Never looked back ✌🏽
Bruno is so talented and versatile, I Love him!
Not feeling this song as much as “Skate” and “Leave the door open” but Silk Sonic is a WHOLE VIBE! I love them ❤️
🤣🤣🤣🤣 These two are genius...💯💯
U the best guys ever my lord
Hi
This is HOT. Keep 'em coming because I am loving it.
Am I the only one that seen Paak go down with the, "I wanna die", was still laying there when Bruno came in and then he popped back up at the chorus? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😆😁😆😁😆😁😆  These damn brothas are too much!!!!! Amazing....
They have no business being this damn talented
Nah I’m very invested I wanna know who the girl that had Anderson and Bruno paying her rent, paying for trips, and out here belonging to everybody. Who hurt my guys man lol. I can’t wait til this full album comes out! OMG
You must learn how to smoking
Essa música já estou sem dúvidas! Vou voltar daqui a uns meses e vai tem mais de 500 mi visualizações
copiando a UCLÃ né seus safados
I LOVE U BRUNO!!!😍😍
Daaaaammnnnn you did it again Silk Sonic, Bruno was really enjoying this song.
The lyrics is a vibe
Cant wait for the album ❤️❤️❤️
i wonder how many cigarettes they used for this
the lyrics should of said “cuz she belongs to the streets” 😂😂
😲😲😲😲👌👌👌
0:32 that's meme fuel right there
Saw them on July 4th in Vegas. Crossed it off my bucket list. So good. 😍
SMH This is a good song, stage act is very good but one word in the song did not have to be there. Great story line in this song but again the music business is still is at an all time low. The Temptations they are not.
I love them together so much! Don’t ever stop making music!!
Everyone that plays it gets better and better, please keep it coming
These videos are lowkey so funny.
Loved the Eddie Murphy quotes. "...Hercules, Hercules"  and "..help me please"
Somebody hurt my man !! I love this song!!! 😭😭😏
Anderson with the David Ruffin vibe
Bruno Mars.....the ONLY short man I've ever loved 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥
i love the way anderson just dies and revives when its his part
Obsessed
This track has Michael Jackson levels of smoothness. Silk dipped in butter isn't as smooth as this track.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Love u bruno😘
best smoking commercial
Love it! 😂 Ready for the album!!!
Waiting for the  tik tok videos… “This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist…”
erra nunca
THE VIBE!!!! rape replay button
I absolutely love this song!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!
Nice performance
Beautiful melody. takes me to 80s which gently hugs me into some warm nights where I was lying in bed listening to Baby Face in the radio. But the lyrics is a little … I would mend that lyrics a little for me and sing this melody to my heart.
Damn this album is FIRE!!!!!!!! I FEEL THIS ONE IN MY DAMN BONES. THEY PREACHIN TO THE CHOIR WITH THIS ONE!!!!!! DIS BROTHA SAID:   "GOT HER BADASS KIDS RUNNIN ROUND MY WHOLE CRIB LIKE IT'S CHUCK E. CHEESE!"  DAMN THEY WROTE A SONG ABOUT MY LIFE DOWN TO THE LETTER. THIS ABOUT TO BE MY THEME SONG!!!!!!!
Dave Chapelle should of been a guest star in this. Especially on the "this bitch" part. Lol
They bout to make magic on this album
Bruno: THIS... BITCH... Me: I Felt That....
He is the new Micheal Jackson when it comes to singing
YESSSSSSSS
How is it possible these guys keep cranking out hit after hit?…🤔🤔🤔 could it be this whole album could be nothing but hits? The plot thickens!!!
Top demais,  sou fã do Bruno mars!
Bruno Mars NEVER ceases to amaze me. One of my all time favorite artists, and Anderson Paak, while I'm not totally familar with his work, is a PERFECT compliment.
Someone stop breaking brunos heart god damn it
LETS FUCKING GOOO
This reminds me of "Treasure". Nostalgic.
best ads for ciggy
This means that theres a lot of unworthy karens out there.
Bruno came ready to fight from the GET
https://youtu.be/jGD-ruZ3IR8 😭😭
I hope and pray 🙏🏿 this works out.🎯💯🇯🇲🇧🇧🇨🇦🙏🏿
WHY IT HAD TO SHOW ANDERSON PAAK LAYING ON THE GROUND LOL
DAMN YOUUUU ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is this supposed to be ironic? It looks like an SNL sketch. This is one of the most tone-deaf songs. Indulging in deep misogyny wrapped up as an old-school love song. Isn't it time Bruno gets back to being Bruno instead of all these throwback homages? Just play a Four Tops or Temptations record instead.
This is fucking lit 💥💥💥
This song remainds me of doja cat 😭🤚
Manda muito bem esse cara. Meninos de ouro.
Cool
This album is bringing back Boys two men and New editions type of vybzz. Can't wait to hear what's next 👏🏾
These two were born to find each other and create musical perfection.
obrigado bruno!
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I will support Bruno Mars until the day I die. I love everything this man touches 😩
Yessssssssssssssssssssss my kind of music. Love it!!
Lmao paak on the floor 😭😂😂
Lit 🔥
Best team singer ever 🔥🔥🌋🌶
If “pass me the black N Mild” was a person 🤣
Three for three! They haven't made a single mediocre song so far.
Looks like Bruno threw the grenade back.
Ok so this is obviously gonna be a no skip album.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
throat cancer by 45 is the next single....
They have done it again! Actually obsessed with this band!!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😍😍😍😍
This song is so comedic!!!😆😆😆
I don’t know if this video was made to make people laugh but it got me right in the giggles!
If BENT ALL DA WAY OUT OF SHAPE was a person 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The magic groove bro..!
It's what late 70's/early 80's music sounds like with todays tech and engineering. Love the vive
🔥🔥🔥
OMG! They've done it again. I was watching this video on repeat till 4am before going to bed. Then woke up and continued watching since. To quote one of Bruno's songs "I am addicted and I don't know why" I love everything about this video. Bruno is a true musician. He plays over ten instruments, but he down plays his skills. I love you BruMar. Anderson, it's a blast getting to know you. Thank you Bruno for introducing him to many of us. 😍👏👏
5th take all of them are high as fuck but i already love this masterpiece
Dat shit is Professor cuz!!
Awesome!!.😀👍👍👍👍💯
Esperei tanto por esse momento 😍😍
I love this “shit” 💕🥰💗😍💯💯💯
Sobrenatural 🤪🤪🤪😍😍
This is crazy 🔥🔥🔥
Need this type of music so sick of that shit thy been making n playing
honestly you make me go crazy with every song❤🔥
I’ve haven’t been this excited for an album to drop in a very long time!
Sounds like a Jackson 5 sample ❤️
Not a Nutty Professor reference!! 💀 This is song equal parts hilarious and musically satisfying
Thank you!
Why was AP on the ground like that 🤣🤣🤣🤣  I love BM AND AP. They are the vibe.
Por favor escriban la letra en español y en inglés. Me morí de la risa. Los nenes corriendo en chuky cheese, el pagándole los diamantes y la renta. Y fumando en el frió unos cigarrillos que la marca es más vieja que mi abuela.  This song made laugh 😂 like a weird crazy lady. He is paying he rent a buying diamonds 💎💍💎. The kids running all over chuky cheese. And he is smoking outside some cigarettes that are older than my granny. Give me a break. Jajajajaja You guys made my day a beautiful one. Thank you. A humble hug from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷❤️😘🙏
a light skinned Sammy Davis.
Back for the fifth time to watch the music video over again
Love to watch and listen to Bruno and his guys.
Smooth song. Great arrangement. Pro choreography. Cautionary lyrics. Men beware. Grow a backbone and stop simping!
If "I ain't sayin she a gold digger" was a 70s ballad!! 😂
What in the "ain't nobody come to see you Otis!" Is going on here?? 😂😂.  I love it!!
He ain’t catchin no grenades no mo y’all
Bruno is cold but Anderson is something else. Dude is a great Artist, musician, and producer in his own right. Don't sleep on Paak man.
Brazil here !!!!😎🍀🎇💝🥁
Patently waiting for this album
Just perfect :)
So dramatic lol why he had to lie on the floor 😂 smh. Amazing video amazing vocals.
We gonna ignore how Paak Laying on the ground for so long lol and bruno singing like the show must go on
This video is what did it for me, LOVE the old school look. Yeah that's a vibe 💪🏾👍🏾
I just don't know why ..but I think everybody has a b..ch like this in our life's!
This is a Phillip Morris wet dream
And the hits just keep on coming.
Anderson. Pak laying on the floor after dying has me weak 😂😂😂
This that banga✊🏾💪🏾💯
When he laid on the floor!! 😂
This one was for Joe.
For some reason I love the hell outta this song I knw it’s about a woman but ima twist it for my benefit 😂😂 why I got it on repeat, drunk ass fuck wit a fake cigarette acting lik I’m in the video… it’s Saturday night an I’m on one😂😂😂😂
I need the brown tux for my handsome boy.
Thumbs down 👎
If we don’t get a performance of this at the Grammys I don’t want it
So fine
SO FYEEE
What a breath of fresh air- this whole album has a great throwback vibe, when music was music …and people who can actually sing.  Nothing like the good old times… so good.
The oldies vibes 🥺
Bruno chose violence
so far, I can name for certain at least three songs in my Spotify 2021 Wrapped.
Too good. I'm listening day one. This video, fucking hilarious.
Song sucks
Hell yes. I understand. How could she.....  It's crazy out here.
Oh no ❤️❤️❤️
Eu me sinto um luxo ouvindo Silk Sonic. This os perfectionnnn ✨✨✨✨✨
Can you imagine if they tour as Silk Sonic and include one another in their individual songs?!?! I'd pay big money for a ticket
Love ❤ it bro bro 💯
They are Proof real music can still be successful in this world!!
Silk Sonic - you guys are treacherous!!! I am loving your interactions on the videos, the words in the songs (play on words), your feel as a whole.  Thank you so much and please keep it coming!
Screamin Hercules that’s one strong woman
Corey Holcombe is proud
This is good and fun
Beautiful voices
OK they've done it again.   The dance formation so much memories of my youth.  Bring it on chaps.
Why does Bruno remind me of Sammy Davis Jr in this 😆
Omg, I'm speechless! Amazing!
Waw
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So far I will be skipping 1 song on the album.
Dramaticly romanticly damn funny lirycs... 😆😆 But still the best
โอ้ยยย ช้ำ ผู้หญิงอย่างเธอ ต้องโดน....
And the award for the most dramatic musician goes to Anderson paak 😂😂
Every single song has been pure musical and comedy perfection. I can’t love this more.
Bruno: speedrunning to upload musics Charlie: upload lots of leaks
They should have included a clip of Yul Brynner saying "don't smoke" at the end...now that would have been funny....
Omg 😆! The “this bit@h got me paying her rent, paying for trips” line is killing me 🤣. I had to rewind it like 5 times. Hilarious! I love how these two are just having fun with this project and STILL putting out music that is FAR better than most of the music acts today. I hope they do a tour and I get to see it soon!
Wow...Dis dude...Bruno u did it again
The things men really want to say to women are in this song.
So good
what's with the cigarettes?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Fakta-Fakta Tentang Meninggalnya artis Vanessa angel dan Suami !!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPE2idiqH5o&t=131s

The drama of the video is everything. When he fell on the floor, Omg love it!!
Always killing it, right Mr. Bruno?? 💖💖
My new favorite song❤❤❤❤

The transitions are something
Amo a Bruno 😍😘♥️💖💋💖💖💖💖💖💖💋💋💋💋💋💋👏👏👏👏👏👏
THATS WHY NEW ZEALAND ISNT DOING TO BAD... WE ARE NOT DUMBARSES
This new tag team they formed is a beautiful work of art
*Paak's "Oh No!"* ad-libs sound like they belong in an *Early 2010s Anthem* song and that's what makes it even better 🤣
My favorite part is “THIS BITCH…” lol 😂
Back to the Future! 📷🎥☎️📻🎙️🎵
SMOKING..FUK GET REAL.. GET WITH THE PROGRAM.. FOR A START...COVID 19// RESPERTORY
Here's another one!
Omg. I’m on my 50 th time watching this lol.

Of all four joints I’ve heard on the album so far, this is the ONE for me. Don’t get me wrong, I love “Skate” and “Leave The Door Open” as much as the intro with Bootsy Collins (a legend we still have among us 🙏🏾). But this song: it gives vibes reminiscent of The Jackson 5, Bobby Womack and Brighter Side Of Darkness. Can’t wait to hear what the rest of the album has to offer. Outta sight, ya dig? 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anderson.Paak laid out on the floor had me weak!!! And when he comes in, "THIS BITCH!"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It really looks old school when ya put the quality to like 360p/480p. It looks real good still.
I’m seriously so thankful for all of this. This is actually unbelievable on so many levels am I am thankful I am alive to experience this! Can’t wait to see this live!
This song is dedicated to all you scandalous woman out there.
😂😂😂💋 I luv it very funny!
#Smokinoutthewindow
0:57 to 1:14 Laughter level 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 100%. Bruno Mars never disappoints anytime, thanks a lot for this masterpiece.
ugh every thing they touch turns gold
Those drums are dope!!! 🔥
He done fell on the floor 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣☠☠☠☠

É um péssimo dia pra ser hater de Bruno Mars!!!
The weekend on a feature would be special
Wow. Just wow 👏 😳 😍 👌
Give her back to the streets, she don’t deserve
Next level
Best artist period
Hooo por Dios q flaco esta bruno mark sera q esta consumiendo algo
Gimme! 😋
Anyone also subtlety reminded of Ashanti - Rain On Me?
https://youtu.be/x2cP4_jtdWg
The Gen Z crew be like "You got me VAPING out the window"
Bruno holding the cig like a joint lmao

ICONIC 👏🏼 👏🏼 🔥 ❤️‍🔥
D’mile 🙌

Man, this album when it comes out, gonna sweep win all them Grammys 2023, mark my words
WTF. 3 boom songs.
New old skul in millennial era😁
You are great BOYS !!! ❤❤❤
The way Bruno delivers his line at 1:37 and points saying “paying her rent” makes me think whoever out there knows it’s about them 😂
If bring back the old skul vibezz😁so smooth,so fresh,so so so def😅
Iron Maiden, AC/DC, and Metallica should be at the Super Bowl halftime show.
“THIS. B!TCH”
Just broke up few hours ago so this hit different but I'm also just cracking up 🤣🤣
Anderson Paak😍
I am sorry I am laughing and dancing at the same time.   I love their vibe 😊😊😊😊
This is smoother than warm butter
tfoja    mama
OMG I love Bruno's voice!!!!!
We needed you brunooooo
Leave the door open and Skate was for the ladies and Smoking is for the fellas.  I expect a makeup song next for both.
😂😂💃🏽🥰🥰🥰 Always coming with the tunes yessss!!!!
So nostalgic, very good, very good (in my Tabitha Brown voice).
I love how YT kept serving this up to me and I finally relented and now I’m upset I didn’t watch the first time.  💯 home run, gents !  BRAVO BRUNO 💜
Woahhhhhh
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
SHE BELONG TO THE STREETS
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Dance moves 😍
Paak's voice is unique bruh like yeah turn a regular song into a hit song voice
Finally some real TALENT and real MUSIC.
Smokin’ criminal❤️‍🔥
Mehn  This jam good ❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ this song.
They did the damn thing with this track! I’m in love with everything! Absolutely a new fall favorite!
3.9k haters
"She's for the streets" but in Motown
Mans literally just chilled on the floor 🤣
This song is on repeat!
this doesn't make any sense, 2 different singers signing the same song not as a feat, or duet. I''m happy bruno mars is over, he wasn't that cool as he brags
I love them. Bye.
oh just great, another song calling women a bitch.  boooo
the same 70's cheap shit he's been doing for over 8 years, this is why his latest  songs are a total flop. This project didn't have anything interesting or cool.
I love him 😭
Bruno Mars said UFC. My life is complete
i was chucklin' and gigglin' the whole fuckin way. Fucking beautifully crafted lyrics!
Love DAT
Did they really release a break up song of the century? Yes. Yes they did 😂😂
This was Epic on so many Levels!
Sempre consegue....❤
Need the women version of this
THIS IS MY FAV COLLAB AS ALWAYS!!!
The theatrics Anderson adds to is hilarious..love them
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯👍🏿
Dope!!!
Love it. 🔥 🔥🔥🔥
Bruno 🥰
Sooo basically.... she for the streets
whos the girl who got Bruno fukked up now
so...we goin' just ignore the fact that a relationship is a TWO-WAY street?  Bitch, you the one who keeps goin' back, as well.
Bruno Mars,Anderson Paak and Sil Sonic never fail me to surprise. Another beautiful songs created.💗💗💗💗💗
from catching a grenade for ya to tossing the grenade back
woozi don't forget to streaming this song <3
Marvin Gaye vibe’s 💟
Honestly an amazing tune but not intelligent lyrics.
Paak literally died I can’t
Caralho, os caras são fodas hein
DES DE RD CRISTO TE AMA BRUNO
Just 6 hours ago they had 5.7 million views to now having 7.1 million geshhh. Real music🧡
FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its when anderson paak fell out and the camera showed he was still on the floor and then he just popped up out of no where for me! 🤣🤣🤣 I was crying laughing!
Amazing
This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nunca decepciona
Motown is BACK.
The best part of this for me was ALL OF ITTT!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤️❤️❤️
I can’t wait for memes for this music video
Bruno Mars singing about how he’s stressed and smoking out the window but now his next song going to be about how he got robbed for leaving the door open
What’s even more crazy is that this has over 7 million views in one day 😳
Damnnnnn so good ❤️❤️
This songs about dating in your 30s
Yeahs we need more groups like is being back that silky smooth R&B

It’s really been 10 years since “Grenade” and Bruno has yet to make a bad song. True talent. Him and Paak are the ultimate combo
I want to be apart of a group like this lol I love how Bruno and the boys have recreated the old school vibes
🔥❤️
Withouth the "bitch" could have been better
They haven’t made one bad song
😍😍😍😍😍
Man, takes me back to the 70's soul.
He hurt and angry 😂
😂😂😂
Lmaooo this song is so funny and smooth.
Love .Paak casually dead on the floor for the official music video at 1:43
Silk sonic greatest of all time.
Modern R&B anthem for “She for the Streets” lmaooo
Hundo says these fuckers play the Superbowl with Snoop.

At this point I feel like Bruno Mars is the closest thing to 80s we have right now.
They don’t miss!

Whatcha not gone do is tell me, with a straight face, that you didn’t run this back [Press repeat] immediately after hearing it the first time. *Also; funniest part of video is 0:31 - 0:35 😂
Other artists : we gotta make the most advanced tech video clip to get the most views  Silksonic : we gotta make the most classical video clip to entertain these people! Cigarettes?
Not long ago I quit both. Cigs and the B:+<#
When you thought she belong to Only you but found out she belong to Only Fans 💔🤣😅
Giving me 1980s vibes nice work though.
Bruno never disappoints! Going to play the hell out of this one! 💝
Aí essa trabalho tá muito incrível, vem álbum!!!!
Your music touches the soul. My mom said if I get 10k Streams on my latest single she'll buy me a professional mic 🙏 ♥️
Bruno had enough. He threw the grenade back 😂😂😂
This song is giving Natalie vibes 💀 but more grown up lol
It was This Bish.. for me 🤦🏽‍♂️🤣😅😂😂😂
😳🤣🤣🤣 bruno always makes me smile 😁
Anderson.Paak is crazy talented. We all know Bruno Mars but the world is about to meet Mr. Paak…
The foot stomps had me smiling, belly on the bed with my legs up all mesmerized 💅🏼😩
The 70:s are back again 🤩. So Marvin Gayish. Love it.   Regards from Sweden.
IDK who needs to hear this THIS GUYS ARE A LEGEND
Finall Anderson.Paak has what he deserves

Wow!
When a girl says "Baby You're My World" just understand that they are 8 other planets.
This generation of kids should be honored to experience this type of music from #SilkSonic...I feel like we are going back to an era when music was music with that classic goodness that will forever be timeless. Make me feel like throwing a afro wig on my head, sexy, crop top with bell bottom pants. 🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶

Don’t get me wrong…. I LOVE Bruno Mars!!  But dude, LOSE THAT GAY MUSTACHE, you are to handsome without it!!!!
Man, this thang bustin’!
The important question is: will Anderson be doing that in live performances too? Would be great lol
Cigarettes so irritating
For anyone struggling with depression,anxiety,stress. Call on the name of Jesus.  If you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord you will be saved and your life will change in the best way possible. I was saved from 12+ years of suicide ideation when I called on Jesus in my time of desperation less than a year ago (I was an unbeliever) now I no longer suffer with thoughts to end my life and I have peace. God bless anyone who receives this message.
Before - Leave the door open Now - How could she do this to me This is the love story
I hope everyone is getting the "message " to all those simps ....🤣🤣🤣 ....t pain has one too "I'm cool with that " simping season is here lmao
Now who the hell done kissed Bruno Mars off got this man airing it out 😂
Bruno is done😭 he done closed the damn door now🚪😭
Anderson paak and Bruno have us something we knew we needed but weren’t sure we would be able to get
LOL! This video is as dramatic as the song and as the Era it represents!!! Love itttt
Lmfaooooo why Bruno singing like that with that cigarette “This bih got me payin for trips”
Love this I can’t wait for the album
The best duo 🔥🎼
Silk Sonic is on the money.
Bitch emphasis 😂😂😂
Anyone think the start sounds really similar to kung fu panda
Bruno’s vocals at 2:52 were awesome
Awe. Shucks you all took me back to the 70's with that HARMONY.
this nigga dont miss
Itu rokoknya garpit ya mas brun?
Silk Sonic is one of the best things to happen to music.
The only group that can sing “THIS BITCH” (emphasis on the B) and make it sound sooooo smooth. I love it 😍 🤣 #OnRepeat
What I love about silk sonic is their music is just so fun. "you smell better than a barbecue:'  "I won't  bite, unless you like" and now this "not to be dramatic, but I wanna die" XD You can tell these guys are just  having a blast.
ameeeeeee este temon....❤❤❤❤❤❤
I fuck with Paak and Bruno hard but I always wonder why  artist/entertainers can call women bitches in songs and women laugh or sing along with it 🤣🤣🤣 but if a regular guy says it he's degrading women. This song is fire tho 🔥🔥
I have Got to see these men live💯
Hercules, Hercules! 💀💀💀😂😂😂😂I love it
Yall snapped 😭😭🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥🔥❤️❤️
This is a hit 4sure! ❤️❤️❤️
wow, instant classic, absolute slapper
Let's go back together to the 80's people.
Another bop 😔 damn
🙌🏽👁️👁️🙌🏽 Did booBear fallout😳😳😆
Listening to these guys, it feels like I died and went to heaven, now I'm listening to the angels and archangels singing
RESPECT SILKSONIC
was here before 50k likes <3
BrunoGod
Mac would’ve love this song
メロディもダンスもすごい好き!!  英語分かんないけど
That fact that many of us know one of the women he’s talking about is hurting my sides lmao
My boy Bruno went from catching a bullet to leave the door open to smoking out the window. 🤕 Ouch
Only these guys can call a " B*tch a B*tch and do it with class!!!
Someone said “which one of you got Bruno Mars out here all the way FCK’D up”  I’m in tears
And here I was searching This Bitch!... oops plus it got me in trouble with my chic I said I wanna hear this bitch she said what big big fight but it's all good now
Liebe ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nice sound, but would be better without the profanity.
thats where you messed up buying stuff for hoes
Totally Motown style!!!
Damn
Name one Bruno Mars song I’ll wait
gotta respect it
mannnnn yall snapped with this one im dying laughing
I love this duo so much. 3 for 3
Mentaly puking.
They could sing about donkey shit and I will STILL bump to it! Love them so much!
The way Anderson lays on the ground and then pops back up kills me 🤣
this is hilarious good!
True Fact : Silk Sonic vocals aren’t joke. Their vocals masterpieces!
80's is back !!!
Damn! so deep in the song vibre and the dance, I love them‼ Masterpiece
#WARNING LEAVE THE COASTS NOW!!! #NEWYORK, THE #EASTCOAST, ALL COASTS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED! #LAPALMAVOLCANO WILL CAUSE A #TSUNAMI #REVELATION88 IT'S HAPPENING SOON!! LEAVE NOW IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!!! #NewYorkCity #NewJersey #LaPalma THE #VACCINE IS THE #MARKOFTHEBEAST #PRAY !!!
Awesome! Also a cautionary tale for when you 'Leave the Door Open'...take notes.
I love Bruno he has such a perfect voice and a special gift, I think of a collaboration with BTS and my head and heart explode 🥰🤩
Thanks Bruno for realising series of heat songs
All men need to play this when their woman gives them problems
It’s hilarious and nice!
Sounded so so Good.....until you called her a bitch! If she's worth singing about, she's worth being called a Lady!
Great production and songwriting but really don’t like the casual usage of “b*tch” in there. Could have as easily just said chick.
They fed up frfr
SILK SONIC DON'T MISS
Awesome , cool , Beautiful ❤
So people still love good music
Simplemente ARTE
Love it❤ Love Bruno Mars's songs
What an awesome duo. Breath of fresh air from all the bull shit
Man they really got this right with these two. Some artist come together to form a group and it just doesn't mesh. This right here is🔥🔥🔥. They both can hold their own and together is just good music. So on point with the moves.
I felt
I have the same velvet costume, it's very hot inside. But now I know I should wear it on the naked body
Silk sonic done did it again...This is 🔥🔥🔥
He's so pure😍
too much flow for the world (fire)
THIS SONG IS FIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This is the best advertisement in YouTube
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Silk Sonic “Smoking Out The Window reaction https://youtu.be/sRB4w1Q6lyk
My alltime favorite artist🥺💞🔥
I saw this on my ad and I gald 😊😊
Well that is it, see you guys in 3 years when this song hits 1 billion views
Who hurt you Bruno!? 🤣😭
What's so wild is that this was just how music was. Like, you couldn't GET on the Black radio stations if you didn't sound like this. Now, we hear this one group doing an homage to it and everyone's acting like the wheel has been reinvented. It's on YOU the music listener...if you stop listening to the wack pop product that was out, they'd have to actually play something with musicians and higher quality.
Paak has brought Bruno into the light. The fact that you guys ignore this says a lot about music "fans" Paak just stepped into the game and look what he has created.
Anderson looked like he was bleeding out on-stage after that fall 🤣🤣🤣
I'm a 50 yr old man and the music from these two has got me pregnant again! Just like happend with skate.
piece of sheet this song , sry but the same alleways
Another FANTASTIC hit from Silk Sonic!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤️
full album?......🤬.......waiting..............✌🤘
Yoooo cuz was dead then came out of no where 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💯
god I loved this!
Bruno Mars done catching grenades now he giving out pimp slaps
I love it!!
wooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Chuckie e cheese lol
This man bruno make you smile and enjoy when he sing that means his songs go to your soul <3 Wow
Lashes .Packaged Hair.fake behind. Stilettos.yep.but underneath is tht Bich.lol
They're slowly releasing a 10/10 album
Ok  Now.Nice.
Joe biden
Como assim estreou ontem e já ter 7 milhões de visualizações? 😱
Anderson carried
LOLOLOL......I didn't even notice at first that Paak was on the floor! Hilarious!
When you don't take Future's warnings seriously:
He threw the grenade back
Bruno Mars is Dennis Edwards, Anderson Paak is David Ruffin, and both dudes in the back is Otis Williams.
she made me quite smoking
Yup
Es el 23 en tendencias nombre aaaa c encula*
Love it....
And here I thought super groups were dead
“Not to be dramatic…” proceeds to play dead then jump back up to quarrel. What a masterpiece in music and comedy
DROP THE ALBUM🔥🔥🔥🔥
3 for 3 with the singles, I am ready for the album. Good music is so refreshing
Not Chuck E. Cheese 😂😂😂😂😂
another bangerrrrrr
Good as always!
Nice melody
Bruno Mars songs are usually nice to listen 👍
The only emoji that describes this video is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I got the 7 millionth view 😎

I can imagine Ariana Grande sings this song
This is incredible! I really hope these guys go on tour for the Silk Sonic album.
Marravinlhoso 🥰🥰💞💞💞💞

It’s the humour that makes these 🤣🤣
Yeah yeah yeah…..smoothhhhh
This is so fucking funny
😂
Que hermoso loco

Dont matter what he do, Bruno wont never ever overcome 24K. That album is so out-of-this-world!

This is what real talent and skill sounds like.
Some real feel good music. Just love the ideas that came together for this classic one.. love Bruno Mars
I was born in the late 90 and this what I always vibe to like a 80’s degree 😎
100% pure music for playboys everywhere. Feel good soul done so right. Can’t get enough. Silk sonic forever.
This video is pure entertainment
Bruno holding that cigarette singing looking like Sammy Davis Jr. 😂😂😂
Love the 70s theme this entire album ❤️
HAWT!!!!
I love the fact that they brought out how deeply men hurt after a break-up. Anderson, "Not to be dramatic but I wanna die."
I'm sorry
The best broken hearted song ever !
Silk Sonic has not made a single bad song together
When he died 🤣🤣💀💀
It's the choreo for me🤗
I mean you guys are just amazing. First album has not arrived yet and I'm already awaiting the second album.

I was waiting for this album. THIS 70s GROOVE IS SO CLEAN 🔥🔥🔥👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I LOVE THIS DUO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I know that’s not Gucci Mane but like ever since Wake up in the sky I know that’s it’s not improbable
Drummer and Keyboard players look like a Hooligan if my eyes are correct💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾E-Panda & John Fossit
Lmfao!! I'm loving it
He said give them back to the city and not the streets 🤭🤭
At 1:41 when Bruno tilted his head and said “THIS BITCH” I felt that in my soul 😩😭😭😭
This is the music the world needs right now!!
the vocals tho.😍💓
Love it y’all!!👏🏽👏🏽❤️🔥🔥
pure perfection
Bad ass kids runnin around my whole crib like its chucky cheese.😂😂😂😂😂omg so true!! The most funniest  lyric in music i ever heard.😂😂😂
👍💕💕💕
God this is so good
Oh hell I missed that part when he was on the ground had me crying laughing hard!

This is so fire wtf???
shes never yours. its only your turn.
I love it 😂
JaeGanDoongEe
this woman y'all singing about belongs to the streets hahahahaa
The moment he said... this bitch! I was on the floor 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Anderson and his comedic timing is timeless.
How the hell do you get and maintain such an amazing voices?  Not smoking.  Bad look. Very disappointed.
Algum brasileiro ouvindo ?
Anderson is a real comedian.  Bruno and him keep bringing back the 70's. Keep it up.
My faith in music has been restored. I'm biased towards music where band members play an instrument, sing lead or backing vocals. This will go in my Leon Bridges,Roots etc... file.
This is better than bts
🤣🤣🤣🤣I'm sorry this is funny but gd song 🔥🔥🔥
Wow officially just became a unfan... sad party sire plenty of women loving this song
CRAP
Man está parte amoooo 1:20 ahhhhhhhh weee me mueroooo 🛐🛐🛐
Love it. I cant stop watching this "dramatic" piece. Is that Jamareo Artis on bass in the video - yes? So cool.
Esto es arte, no la mierda de kunno
This song she be retitled: "Song of the Simp".
Oh yasssss! Silk Sonic always comes with it! No one does smooth, comedy and old school vibes better than Silk Sonic. I'm diggin the choco velvet with the fake cigs 🚬 straight 70's. Where all my Bitches at? 😏💗🎶
Seriously, Unorthodox Jukebox came to mind right away. Best record off the forthcoming album so far in my opinion.
Me enkantas brunooooo mars viejo sabroso te amooooo muchoooo 💗🛐💗
Weeeee lo amoooooooo tanto tanto tanto ahhhhhhhh 😩😩💗💘💗💘💗💘😩
Wooo
Hooligans hasta el final 💘😩💘😩💘😩💘

Love at the very first 🎵 melody 😍

Tell your kids that Bruno is the best without them asking who the best is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🥂
Still shoulda called the group sexual chocolate.
Bruno didn’t play when he said “ this bitch “ 😂
I am not sure about this one Bruno
I hate that each time this dude come out with a sound it become my favorite song I hate and love Bruno Mars music. Another hit
It's reminding me of the old and old is good
Wow that is some sad old retro sexist bs.
Flame 🔥
Bruno is so underrated. Such a living legend. Can’t wait for you to perform on my wedding day
Bruno Mars nunca decepciona!!. ❤️
Baby! He is fed up!!!! 😭😂😂🤣
Lirik nya bikin ngakak 😂😂. Cool

This is given The Temptations and I’m here for it!
❤❤❤❤
Oh you didnt do it again. This is a bad ass choon. Cant wait for the album. Yet another great video. Always tells a story
Did Future put y'all up to this😂😂
Next time I go to a disco I'm gonna do that dance. No failure.
No, Bruno Mars is actually underrated and it pains !
That nigga was laid tf out 😭
😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
Oh the drama ...and to whomever is out here barefoot in these streets✌❤😅
These two never miss a beat when it comes to R&B  Soul.  We need more music like this today like back in the 80's and 90s'.  Bring Real Music Back!!
Lovely
1:44 Anderson is fcking hilarious 😂
Yeeeeeeeeeeeee🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✊🏽
Just killed it!!! Please let this be the beginning of a resonance of R&B.
Damn this shit is smooth as fuck!!! Love it
The sound from this group is on point!
I just cannot describe it better.. since they debuted with Leave The Door Open, I genuinely feel helluva' entertained musically by these guys. Can't wait for the full album 🤯
❤️❤️❤️
Espero el álbum.

Song o the year🌋🔥🙌
Adoro esse estilo anos 80 do Bruno Mars... rs
Merveilleux
This video?!?!😩🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿 it’s hilarious but also sooo freaking amazing!!
These niggas smoked this track. No pun intended but that was bars tho.
BRUNO MARS- SMOKING OUT THE WINDOW  A BREATH OF FRESH NEW AIR IN A MONOTONOUS MUSICAL ECO SYSTEM  From the simplicity of the storyline, that kept true to the roots of Soul music, to the simple yet eloquently crafted dance moves that blended well with the stage, to the nostalgic undertones of the music's video display, this song hit every note that it should, and, albeit momentarily, took us back to what RnB truly is   9/10
🤣🤣🤣
...I enjoyed 70s RnB the 1st time.  Angry RnB meant to sound like 70s RnB not so much
Who ever idea it  was to bring both of em together deserves a medal  cause the music they make it's like magic 🪄
Bruno Mars tells the ugly truth so beautifully 💖 got her bad kids running around my house like it's Chuck E Cheese 😅
Not Anderson getting back up to get into the shot! 🤣🤣🤣
Yeah man. Genius
I love so much my Bruno, beattifull músic ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Maaaaaannn, listeeeeen! 🙌🏾💕✨🔥🔥🔥🔥
His Art is ENCHANTING ‼️✨😍forever a fan🎶💯♾
Silk Sonic is an amazing duo!! Great energy!!
These dudes dont miss
This is what I needed
not to be dramatic................but im dead ass on the floor dead laughing my a** off. can't wait for the album if there is one. im loving it!!
WOW wow
This is epic wow
These cats got it not a song I heard that’s wack yet
instantáneamente 10/10, simplemente increíble
Nunca hay desperdicios con estos señores🥰
Reminds me of never can say goodbye by Jackson 5
Keeping Soul Alive in the Music Industry!
flaco, dime cómo siempre haces arte?
I honestly thought the lyrics was going to be “She belongs to the streets” 😂

People should start blaming Bruno Mars for the sudden rise of childbirth. His songs are such aphrodisiac. I warned you.
If "she belong to the streets" was a song
😅
A wonderful take on classic music. Your hits just keep coming as you are the true king of soul during this age and time. Ya killing me.....🤣
Next years Single - Cancer in The Car
slow this down to .75 and light your blunt!
The classiest way to say, "she for the STREETS"
I like Anderson Paak a lot. I just cant stand Bruno Sars or his annoying voice.
The Camera Man Needs To Be Acknowledged On This!
There goes my babies 😍😍 They did not disappointed me with this song 😊
This video was refreshing. Nothing fancy, just talent.
The smoothness in this is so hard that I didn't even realize that they are roasting a girl. Damn!😂
This band is exceptional ❤️❤️❤️❤️
How and why does this hit so hard (smoking out the window of the bathroom listenin on my phone...)?
Spiral cables on the bass & guitar. Just like the 70's. Bruno never misses anything with the retro stuff.  It's all about the ..... DETAILS!!
Jackson 5 in 2021👍👍🙈🙈🙈
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G9E7j4l4Tdo&t=80s My new song Because it only taks a moment from your time
*Boys after break-up:*

Got a new song 🎵 😌 👌
Damn.. The chocolate suits and the voice is really smokin' hot😂🤍
🎵🎶 smoking in the video... Bruno how could you do this to me? 🎵🎶
The duo we never new we needed
Don't you just wonder how much did these guys get paid by the Tabaco industry to preform with smoking cigarettes?  Great song btw
First of all this song is amazing….  Second if y’all never said y’all was gonna leave the door open she wouldn’t have y’all smoking out the window….you chose violence 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 jk these songs are brilliant man
... So nobody was gonna help Anderson .Paak off the floor?!
Awesome video awesome I love Bruno and Anderson fantastic

So much talent in such a small package.
Another hit!!! Love it
Everything. Just everything! 🔥🔥🔥

Love the music of this song.. I could hear influence from the beginning of dangelos send it on song live in São Paulo concert on vevo and robin thickes in the morning song.. music is beautiful with these two artists
Bravo sirs
This style of music is timeless
This shit GROOVY ASF
Everything Bruno throws out is a straight banger.
Vc Sempre me faz lembrar de alguém
This project has some of the best music in a long time.. vocals are so sick, and the musicianship is incredible.
Bruno done closed the damn door not leaving  it open no more 🤣🤣🤣
OH NOOOOO.. Woah Woah, and I'm with my dumbaxx thought they can't top Leave the Door Open... this is Fire
Oh thanks Bruno and paak. Finally something new I can fuck too, yall real ones. Especially since Weeknd don’t wanna make fucking music anymore
I’m sorry but that “this b!tch” hit hard… I feel it
Those vocals are UNTOUCHABLE..They are in a league of their own..so freaking SMOOTH!!

Anderson on the floor had me dying too😂😂
https://youtu.be/g0mwmqEfONI
smokers are a disgrace.  cannot believe he would make a song advertising smoking, something that kills millions every year not to mention the damage they do to innocent people.  this song is a disgrace and should be taken down.  love bruno but this is just wrong.
Back in the day, music 🎶  Love it❤
they went 3/3  the album is about to be aoty
If Bruno keep up with all this good work, good music, and not following trends he can come close to Michael Jackson.
These cats are KILLIN' the game!
Mitici
Brazil on Here! ✌
When every other is trying to create a hip hop song, we certainly needed this medicine to our ears. Thank you bruno for being who you are .
anyone who likes this music is my friend.

Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
I had to grow up to simp music talking about women are sugar and spice and everything nice and ****. These kids get to hear this good red Pill truth music, awesome! Real men rejoice!#theybelongtothestreets
crap
When he said Hercules Hercules.. I felt that.
I love their music and I really like Bruno Mars and I do not want to sound like a hater but I notice that their songs kinda sound the same. This one sounds like Leave the door open and Skate sounds like Treasure..
I already know my sugar daddy thought about me when he listened to this lmao
me gusta mucho como en vez de un video liryc promueven el lanzamiento de una cancion en un escenario. con la cancion Treasure en color Dorado, aqui con el rojo y espero que en proximos lanzamientos hallan escenarios con el resto de colores...
If Marlborough were still making adverts today...
Bruno Mars & Anderson.Paak the combination we never knew we needed.
Great song and video! I bet Malboro sponsored its production though :P
I like how he says UFC lol, my favorite part of the whole song !!!!!!!
This album gonna be crazy
نفس الالحان ماتغير شي😔
Não fuma!
“Got yo bad ass kids runnin around like it’s Chuck E. Cheese” 😂😂😂   He was stressing! 😂
*"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die"*
Smoking kills 🌚
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Whenever i ask 5$ from my dad he be like this bitch...... 😆
Musica ruim e apologia ao cigarro que merda é essa/?????????????????
Bruno and Anderson never disappoint can't wait for their album
Do. Not like the words but the beat is okay
Smooth. A lot like Leave the door open...with nice additions
2:50 !!! Bruno is insanely good 🔥🔥

This song and video will be forever etched in my brain! It must have been so much fun making this song and video! And this is why i am a big fan of both artists!
THIS FOOL AP!!!! 🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀
Sounds so old school yet it feels like new school!! This is music at its finest!!
When that nigga popped back up in the camera scared the hell out of me 🤣🤣🤣
Damn! This song gets better the more you listen to it.  After some 100+ listens, I've got drums, bass, guitar, keys down.  Perfect! ❤️🔥
Best vid I have seen for ages. Silky by name ....
This song is the best I’ve heard 💕
"This bitch got me paying her rent 😂". This song is fucking hilarious but yet catchy😏🥰.

the duo the world needed
Dis bitch got me smoking out the window!
Anderson Paak is a damn fool. I haven’t laughed this hard at a music video in a while. When he popped his head in and said, “This bitch…” I started cracking the hell up. Then he “died” on the floor only to pop up again. Hilarious!!!!
Omg!!! That was amazing!!!
This is fire 🔥 okay okay
OMG why am I in love with this song😍
So funny & beautiful- sort of took me back a bit!! Loved it!!
Váóóóó😳😳😳😳❤️❤️❤️
They keep coming off as a cross between good music and a parody of good music.  It's almost like weird Al making original music instead of remakes.
You can tell the person who wrote Suede has had a hand in this lol
Been a while, but awesome song that's Art
超喜欢他俩贱贱的样子，太可爱了
We gotta meme the hell out of this song!
Canzonlltalianre

"This Bitch" and Anderson laying on the ground will be a fine edition to the Foundation of Memes!
My mom and I could not stop laughing at this for the life of us. The line that got me was "got these bad ass kids running around here like it's Chuckie cheese" and when Anderson Paak fell to the floor. I cannot 🤣🤣
Wow 😍 wow 😍 wow 😍
them dancing together and their clothes is everythinggg passes as automatic 80's vibe
akram maha 😉😉😉

Let’s go Brandon
Is it to soon to say silk sonic is iconic 🤎💛🧡🤎🧡💛
I've gotta give you back to the city lmaoo.....more like give you back to the streets
So basically a song about a girl that belongs to the street
The day to seek God is today. The day to repent and surrender to Christ is today. Tomorow may be too late. Your life is too precious And the blood of Jesus Christ washes us from all sin. : "For God so loved mankind that He sent His Holy Son Jesus Christ that all who believe in Jesus might be saved" (John 3:16). And in heaven God will wipe away every tear from our eyes. Pray. Always read the bible. Jesus loves you. Peace of Christ.🙋🙏🌹🌹🌺🌺🌷🌷🌹🌹🌺🌺🌷🌷🌹🌹🌺🌺🌷🌷🌷🌷
this song is absolutely magical . one of the best collabration in the history so smooth so clean.
Git me feeling stressed out for them!!😂😳
Boring!!
This has a good sound from the 70s but the content is off...
Anderson.paak is straight comedy here lmao what a guy
That's how you know that you are "whipped" by the "female genitalia". Lol😅😂🤣😅. She got you "smoking out the window" and other crazy, wicked things. My God🤣😂🤣🤔

I’m old school Motown and all but they’ve refined, defined and intertwined all the best stuff and Love It!!  I used to be young, beautiful and full of life and remember it well.
Billion Dollar man. Bruno s gonna help save the world.
Great song but they definitely missed out on saying “ she belongs to the streets” as father Future has told us
Here before the billion Views
Trifling *** walking barefoot in these streets.  Now that's something.
Did it a-fuquen-gain!  Makin’ MUSIC!  Doin the WORK!  Not recycling loops n “beats”…….👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿!
I'll cry the day Silk Sonic is disbanded. This some real R&B right here
We needed something different so bad from today’s artist , well done 👍🏾
I can only say bravo!  I love the entire production.  The lyrics are killing me.  Most romantic HO song ever.  Sadness for all the men who can relate.  This is your new anthem like Tyrone was for us. LMAO
Love the music and the art behind this. However, it s 2021 and we are still trying to fight the tobacco lobby that promotes and glorifies deadly tobacco addiction. Please do not support tobacco addiction in your wonderful music.
don't smokee
Y would someone dislike this song?🙄
3 for 3
The smoothest cigarette ad ever.
their dance is sooo smooth
AAAA MTO BOM SCRR :')
ooh yes....no porn music

Another Silk Sonic, '70s-soul-vibe masterpiece. And the award for most dramatic, funny-@zz scene in a music video goes to Anderson .Paak. Had me hurting so bad from 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that he took me straight out!!!💀💀💀⚰🪦
Great music!

stankface came out as soon as the song started😂
When you're angry af, but you gotta keep it classy!🥂❤
Bruno is a black man
They play too much😅💀
Another one!!! Anderson Paak playing dead just beautiful ahahah
Paak has brought the best out of Bruno Mars for me personally.
Bruno, needs to go ahead and form a boy band.. lmao
You know how every girl uses lyrics from every song and post it on Facebook and now this is going to be all the dudes blasting this and putting it on Instagram. Lol
soooo good 💯
Non so se è normale il fatto che il video è stato pubblicato da nemmeno 24 ore e ha già 6 milioni di visualizzazioni
It’s the “ This bitch” for me 😭
All men stand up he saying what we think
Out of all the words in the English, dropping the B-word and A-word, etc., seem to be only words today's entertainers use. The smooth sounds and choreography is no compensation for the lack of imagination in word usage.  Contrary to popular belief, mediocrity is not the standard nor a substitute for excellence.
❤️
*dance spiderman vs squid game **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFGsG8MGCsY*
I like music videos get closer to be a live singing I know this isn't live but attempt to bring back the live music is awesome
I'm not broken or what so ever but broo, bruno mars always keeps me vibin
Can’t wait for the Album Release🙏🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵
Plot twist the cigarette is a paid actor ...
Bruno bringing the 70s and the weekend bringing the 80s just proves music was better back in the day
Just when I thought I couldn't love Bruno Mars anymore he does this😍
This song is just so fire!
Why the hell this video doesn’t have 1B views yet???

You guys pick Bruno Mars over Slipknot for Trending Music on YouTube. You people have no taste.
They can do no wrong
We needed this toxicity after the summer walker drop
I love u Bruno
Damn. Already love this song. Theses two gel together so well
I couldn't continue to listen to this song. I am a huge Bruno and Anderson Paak fan. However, this song is trash. Sound like they promoting cigarettes as well. Not my taste. Sure it have old school vibe but this song isn't good, to me. My two cent.
Cant wait for full album
Sounds like the philly sound!!!😉❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇬🇧
My lonely friends falling in love in one night love with a girl he meet in wechat  . She soo lovely and nice  but he understand she kindes and love belong to everybody ...

Los oídos de todos: 🌝🌠🌟✨💎
I just realised that i haven't seen smoking cigarettes scenes in  pop videos for quite a while, after the non-smoking campaign has been kicked off especially in Europe. I liked the video and i love bruno he is so damn hot. Great song👏
오
Can the album just drop already?😆
🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Homie died 😂😂 I love this whole album, definitely will be timeless.
They deserve to win multiple grammy this year
Everything about this is perfect! The suits are so damn hard and the choreography and set design is amazing! EVEN THE DAMN CAMERA MOVEMENT🔥🔥😮‍💨
It’s 2am and I’m here crying overthinking that I can’t imagine a world without Bruno Mars. His songs are my comfort songs and seeing him making new songs just completes my day
King of laid back sonics....I don't smoke but this chill vibes. Disclaimer - smoking cigarettes has ingredients which definitely cause cancer. Marijuana doesn't
Yall make some great music together. Bruno I feel like you have slowed the songs down with this group and gave us back that flow you had when u first came out. I'm loving all yo music. Keep it up!
Wow 🤩 so good 😊 my new favorite 🤩 🎧 🎶 song
Calling  a woman the "b" word is beneath your talent.  Please respect  the women who give birth to this nation.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
They don't miss
This takes me back to a place where everything is great & I am happy
Anderson is absolutely hilarious in this lmao!
Ses vraiment le meilleur 👌👌👌👌👌
they dont stop SERVING
Y'all did it again!!! Another HIT!! Gotta give her back to the city!!
The filling just give you old school music vibes
Waw ! What I hear 🔥🔥🔥🤧🤧🤧
I wanted to hate this project but I’ve been super in love with it. Seriously great job. I’ve never been a Bruno Mars fan and I’m low key angry at how much he’s been changing that. Kudos.
This is such a bop... yall too young for this cut right here!
aaaaa meu amor por eles é sem explicação🥺🤍
5 thumbs up 👍...
It's Mark Anthony
This is so good!!!! And Anderson. Paak's dramatics, dude deserves an Oscar 😂
1:43 😂
Love this
Espetacular, na moral... impressionante!!!
0:32 kills me every time
How do you thumbs down this song, ya'll have no taste 😳
Gott, freu ich mich auf den 12.Nov🙏🤩Silk Sonic Release 👍😎
I love it
They portray the time that my parents are just kids and it's cute coz I like the Motown vibes. Great job again!
#Smokinoutthewindow
Esto me lleva directo a los 70s :))
I love You ❤️
Admiro mucho a Bruno Mars, pero incentivar el cigarrillo y fumar, cantar con un cigarro en la mano fatal, me parece super mal, la canción suena bien como todo lo que el hace, pero incentivar eso directamente, me parece fatal.
this MV have a lot of meme potential😁
Anderson getcho ass up! I’m hollering! This shit is hilarious and a bop at the same damn time! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Amo Bruno Mars, amo mais que chocolate !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
got STD: Simp, Time wasted and Dumped.  🤣
He just don't miss. Love him
Smooth
“Not to be dramatic…” proceeds to play dead then jump back up to quarrel. What a masterpiece in music and comedy
Best vid ad i didn't skip.
This is my jam!!! Silk sonic is so legendary for bringing it back to such a funky Era! It's funny it's dramatic its old school vibes.
Is this music season? Great songs coming out left right and centre!
Reminds me of Cee-Lo's F#$k You. Bitter men can be funny as hell!
Nah this is it this is the vibe we needed back
Leyendas
This looks like an SNL music video skit but in the best way possible
I wonder how many ladies can make the connection between these lyrics and what Kevin Samuels talks about on his channel. Lol 🤣 but I think they'll just sing along obliviously
Silk Sonic is a freakin time machine. Just give them their Grammys and let's all go home.
Hermosa canción, hermosas voces. Bello trabajo de Bruno Mars y Anderson.
https://youtu.be/KnM-lJUCwkE
It is soooooo damn refreshing to hear and see REAL talented music artists having fun making "hit" music because their TALENTED enough to do it.....Love it guys. Please keep it coming.
As an old man, this slaps hard.
This shit is so damn fire 🔥
I love this Collab
Sorry Y'all  This song is wack.
This is the best thing I have seen in a long time!!
Now I want to smoke. Thank you!
Name: Brandon Paak Anderson Stage Name: Anderson .Paak Date of Death: Nov. 5 2021 Cause of Death: Not being dramatic
It's scary how well they're complimenting each other.
The Sammy Davis Jr of our generation
Sammy Davis Jr is back from the grave
this reminds me of that Outcast song about roses.. lol
Now this is fucking music 😂🔥
This just in... She belongs to the streets.
This shit go!!!
Is this an actual song?? Hmm.
Haaaa they snapped
Bruno Mars has been on my radar b4 the world knew his name. His talent is off the charts, checks all the boxes of MJ, but as I've stated in past, the cursing, nudity & smoking cigarettes in this new video need to go. He doesn't need to share being a front man with anyone, and using his platform musically to "Heal the World" is long overdue. I saw him live in 1st concert tour with the Hooligans, by far the best concert I've been to other than Michael's!
BRUNOOOOOOOOOOOO   TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
No se olvidend e los coristas, la rompen tambien, dos crack en todos los videos tambien
SMH
Tighten up player! 😂 suckers get licked! 🤷🏽‍♂️
She belongs to the streets, let her go 🙅🏻‍♂️
Hilarious
So Dope a throwback. Reminds me of Soul Train.
SINGING AND DANCING TO THE NEW SONG
helooooo malaysiaaaaa
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
ahahaha ....NAAHHH y'all knew what the game was when you left the door open......where y'all thought she was coming in from!!!!   Bet you close that damn door now!!!! HA HA HA HA
The classicness. The dancing. And most of all, the singing. Beautiful.
🎤🔥🔥🔥🎧🇧🇷
I'm getting "Never can say goodbye girl" vibes
Amazing
that 5 in the bass over that 2 is amazing!
06-11-2021
Bruno Mars is wanting  to play Sammy Davis Jr real bad.
This is giving “Ain’t nobody coming to see you Otis” David Ruffin vibes! 🚬
After listening to leave the door open and she breaks your heart and you start listening to this jam 😂😂😂😂
I didn't know Sammy Davis was still alive.
ALBUM OF THE DECADE … I’m calling it now !!
This song is great omg
I can’t with these two. I’m SCREAMING 🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️
paak on the ground & popping up singing is hilarious 😂
Acting and music SOOOOOOOO ON POINT 🔥🔥
smoooooooooking out the wiiiiiiiiindooooooow
He went from leaving tht door open to being tired of her shit smoking out the window lol 😂😂😂
I already know the words to this song it’s too good!
LOVED LOVED LOVED ❤

There’s no reason for this to be so grateful.
I love how silly they are
I miss old bruno mars😔
broke the knob!
This gives me the chill vibez already.. 😎
I need to fully interrogate these idiots that down voted this piece of magic
This is the change we neeed
Anderson .Paak laying dramatically on the floor is a great cinematic moment. Also someone on twitter was saying how RnB fell off because today’s musicians are drinking henny instead of doing coke. Silk Sonic is bringing back that old school quality music laced with coke that we all missed  😂
Their chemistry is only matched by that between Andy Samberg and Justin Timberlake in the dick in a box trilogy
Great music and great humor 🚬
These guys have created magic
wow!! shit is a banger! and funny as fuck!!!!
Omg, i falling love your guys again!! ❤❤❤😁😁😆😆😆
These guys are amazing. I love the song, the video and just the whole vibe when they work together.
this type of song people often ignore and it makes me sad :(
1:14 That has EASILY got to be Top 10 Verse starters in the History of Music 🔥😭
Waoo
I love this song I needed this fr
This song and video is too funny for words 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love it!
Anderson we are dead ☠️

I could listen to these gentlemen all day everyday...  HOOAH!!!
This  song and video gives so much.  The musicians, lyrics, dance moves even slight comedy.  Silk Sonic is the Stuff.  Great collaboration with these 2.
This album are legit ✨✨✨
he amazes me with each new song. he is the only artist singing the old motown style. he is bringing music back to this generation. not rap bet true melodies.
I love this😍😍😍
Ain't no Bruno Mars or Anderson .Paak alone anymore, now there is just Silk Sonic
This what happens when you "LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN" for her to "SKATE" into your life now you "SMOKIN OUT THE WINDOW" lmaoo
Thank you for bringing good music back😍
this is so f*cking good~
Hilarious this could be a SNL skit
Love it.

These foos try so damn hard to tap into peak black 70s soul groups and always seem to miss the damn mark 🙄

Nice a new song
1:15
Look at Brandon and Peter PROMOTING SMOKING.
These lyrics ....😂😂😂
Anderson .Paak: "not to be dramatic"   Proceeds to fall on the floor and play dead
I don't know... but if he is shelling out all that money to a woman who is not taking the relationship seriously, she is not the B**ch, he is the fool trying to buy love but then...I don't know
Que música boa , gostosa de ouvir faz bem para o coração!!! Amoooo
In conclusion she belongs to the streets😂
The moral of the story:  She's for the streets
good for her
00:32 had me weak LMFAO, at that point i dont need to see anything else i know its a hit
This is Gold.
Every song is magic! Such great music.
Muito boa !

Como siempre genial Brunito❤❤❤❤
Loving the humour touch of Paak and Mars appearing and disappearing on one another haha🤣!

Bruno Mars the trailblazer as usual - nothing short from brilliant 👏👏👏
Am i the only one who's waiting for them to smoke that damn cigarette

Bruno is a f'n GENIUS he's bringing 70's soul to 2021 and making it groovy again, this is a whole vibe😎🔥
Hercules and the stomp took me out I felt that 😂😂😂
YESSS BRUNO LATELY IS JUST OMG
The R&B Gods sent Bruno to single handedly bring back real R&B…I’m so hear for it. It’s giving I’m “Rick James Bitch”❤️❤️!!!

I love bruno but i dont like the style that is using latetly
whitest teeth in the game. As always
The songs are great and all…but why…why do they have to call a woman a bitch???!!! When you point one finger you got three pointing back at you !
Bruno Mars solo stuff is still absolute trash but this shit slaps
The beginning, the lights, playing dead on the floor, Bruno Mars being a hallmark as usual.. Brilliant!!!
Grew up listening to disco with momma hard vibe
Paak and Bruno held it down like those cigarettes 🔥
Rokok surya ke tu? Lama betul hidup rokoknye
This Song is the Jam From start to finish!!! 🎵🎵🎵

Everything Bruno Mars drops never ceases to amaze me!! Ugh I want to see him in concert so bad lols

Damn this gig is AWESOME!
Cigarettes??? Really... 🗑

Got introduced to Anderson Paak through NPR's Tiny Desk concert.
I just suffered a break up, and I truly wanted to die. But this song gave me the comfort i needed to move on and find the right one for me
Leaving the door open didn't worked... She got other plans
I had to come back and watch this again just for kicks... We need this kind of entertainment right now silk sonic keep doing your thing.
a magical song and performance from another world  .... what outstanding and so authentic performance  . thumbs up
This is tune! It's been a while since I've enjoyed a song like this. It's funny and smooth. Great video too! Color me impressed
From vietnam with love 🤩
POWERFUL!  I ❤ Bruno Mars.  🎵 This song had me cracking up! 🤣🤣🤣
Bruno Mars is to cool for his self he play the part too the "T" old school character from the late 1960 and to the early 1970 like Sammy Davis Jr. who could do everything sing and tap dance and act his career start at the age of 3 Bruno start at 4 .
Now this is what we call music.
Proof that musics better when everyone does coke
damn those smooth vocals get me every time
Smokin out the window eyyy 🕴🕺🏾💃🏻👯
She innocent...lol
Love that they’re bringing back the way way back.

Love Bruno and Anderson! Super Silksonic!!! Wait…is it just me or Anderson Paak looks and acts and sounds like Dave Chappell..??

I love this song 😂😂😂
I guess bruno mars is done catching grenades, he start throwing them back.
This song is funny as hell. If you focus on the flow of the beat and the style of the video you will get caught up in the fact that it feels like a nice, back in the days, Jackson 5 love song. When you actually listen to the lyrics, they're pissed off. LMFAO
🤎🤎🤎
Anderson paak talking about not trying to be dramatic and there he is laying on. The floor 😂😂😂
We need so much more shit like this! It’s good and they are just having fun! Perfect example of the art not having to take a backseat to have a laugh. Good shit guys!

I looooove you Anderson .Paak! Forever and always you killin’ it. Whatever you touch turns to gold!
I feel like a purple power.
I’m glad these two found each other, they make good music!
😄 Its funny everybody giving Bruno props when this song is clearly a Anderson Paak composed song.
YA ŞİMDİ canımda çikolata çekti :/ ;)
Promoting smoking is never a good thing...
From Versace on the FLOOR, to leave the DOOR open, now smokin out the WINDOW. Which part of the house is next? 🤔
It’s disappointing to hear that kind of sound with those lyrics
Mood swings triggered. The best 😍
Hol up hol up.. she skated to your door.. THAT YALL initially left open… left ya real smooth like silk supersonic…NOW SHE got ya smoking out the window?? Not even outside, just said fuck it in the comfortablity of your own home lit up.. Man…. *pulls out Newport’s  I feel ya dawg I feel ya🚬

Bruno has been on fire like always, but I'm super digging this new style a LOT. Perfect song and video!
Bruno can do no wrong! Love all his music.
Eu tô gritando ahahahahhaha amazing
Oh no! LOL
That real pimp playa Cadillac music for the whip right here! Silk Sonic doing justice for us old school music lovers living in the wrong era ya dig!
C'mon Bruno, I should be studying and you came out with this gem
Ok they on one with this lol 👍🏾
Giving me “ never can say goodbye” vibes
Silk sonic only makes banger songs ong, this album is gonna be unskippable
I’m feeling so relax after watching this
If Will Smith, PJ Washington, and Johnny depp could make an album
Please Bruno don't smoke anymore after this piece. Preserve your health for another hundred years and give us another thousand pieces like this One
This is gonna be the album of the year 👏
Lori Harvey has 24 hours to respond

Moral of the story: She belongs to the streets.
i need a bts breakdown of this video and editing fire song
bruh 1:43
SMOKING IS NOT COOL!
Anderson too funny bruh💀💀💀
This shyt garbagio, trying too hard these cats
Aye y’all rember my comment on “imma leave the door open” well this fits that description even more except it’s the drunk uncles teaching they nephews lol
Bruno is officially my favorite singer 💫😍😘
I love some Paak. Vibes just 1000%.
Mans out here face down on the floor 💀
My grandma loved Bruno Mars, said he was Michael Jackson reincarnated. She died last year, if she heard this she would be so proud.
And Anderson still laying on the floor hahahaha
Super SMOOTH!
Damn 🔥🔥🔥
I LOVE YOU BRUNO ❤
Motown vibes. And I'm cruising the waves. 💘 can't wait til full album
The vintage vibe is everything!!!!
Man de-cuffing season was brutal this year
I love you🥴
This nigga was laying on the ground 😂
This "she belongs to everybody, everybody uhh" is the big thing in this song, the voices, choreography, drums, that short moment could late some minutes, is the peak of the whole work  Edit: - also we must add they doing smoke with real cigarettes.  - The Dead Anderson Paak. On the floor hahaha
These two are definitely one of the best collaborations in a very long time when it comes to music in general regardless of genre.
They just snapped 😂 another favorite 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯
This vibe is strong
Now, I can't be the only one that thought he was gonna say 'she belongs to the streets'
Makes me want to take a road trip & blast this the entire time
Good music jus can't b denied no matter the age group  generation  or race these guys definitely got it figured out its amazing 👌
the popping back  up for his part of the song after laying down dead
Basically she belongs to the streets
Jackson 5 set💞
what a way to say she 'she belongs to the streets'
At least I know how these guys smell now.
As always Bruno Voice is insane 😍🔥
uptown funk is da best :)) we all love u BRUNO MARS
I'm thinking how many guys gonna be secretly going - bout time someone said it for us 😂🤣🙈
i’m here fucking dyin laughing.
the best duo HANDS DOWN ARGUE WITH THE WALL
I'm definitely going to buy this album when it's out, I need to listen to this in the car, in the shower, looking at the sky at night, I just need to listen to it all day
He say the b-world with so much heart! Kmsl!
I respect Bruno for going retro
Shesssh
fresh🎉. this dude is just something else
Resumen de la letra: SIMP
im so happy this has happened cause this duo is fuego
Anderson. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When they sang This Bit*h I felt it 😂😂
anderson doesn’t get enough love for me
Yeahyeahyeahhhh
it's already a timeless classic hit to me.
Flyin🧚🏻‍♀️
I think they should create band
Bruno mi religión 🛐
The first few seconds I didn't think this song was gonna live up to the hype of "skate" and "leave the door open" But I the beat the dramatics and killer sound made it so amazing I watched it back to back.
Bruno keep coming with these hits
SILK SONIC ARE THE BEST 🥰🥰🥰
My type of generational music of meditation
Missed opportunity to say “she belong to the streets”   Joking but this song is good!
Good song,  but the use of the word bitch was necessary?
I love this song.  How can you not smile?
🔥🔥🔥
Love it....bring back that absolutely great 🎶 🎵
*perfect*
Do not make it look like smoking is cool. Tobacco kills.!
Drop the album already.
this is hilarious!!!
This Bitc.....  😂
I guess where going to wait till 2030 for the album to drop 🥵😬😓
Goated
The bestfriendnerism in this whole silk sonic movement is just so honest and true!! They are Truly besties!!!
And another one.........
Love this sound sooooooo much! What a vibe!
I guess she didn't come through when you left the door open, now it's "this bitch".  SMH and LMAO at the same time...Only Silk Sonic.
This is vibe 90's !!! Very good 🌟🌟
ho my God!!!! brilliant!!!
Nice 👌
He is trying so much to be cool, unfortunately he is not
Now THAT! is music!
Ok, enough is enough with good music. When is the album going to be drop? I need to play this in my car. And why there was not a listening party
This sound takes me back to my fun days.. Brilliant!😃 I am so addicted
Love from kenya🇰🇪
not even a minute and already groovin, gonna love this album
Brunoooo ❤️🥺
TALENT.
Wow silk sónic do it again !!! 🤩🤩
It's good to be living in the 70's again thanks to these guys. Soul Train 100% Watching this in 144p.
I'm 25 but I'm jammin to this like I'm in my late 30s.
The song sounds way better at 1.25 speed lol
Every Bruno Mars song sounds exactly the same , this trash
Fire
My ears have been blessed again wow
I missed you.. 😁
Bruno regreso! Maravillosa musica
Walangya ka talaga bruno hahhahaha 🔥🔥🔥
I love this so much. I cannot wait for the album.

❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
smokin inside the window
❣️❣️🇳🇵🇳🇵
Another great one….. smooth style….. 👏👏👏👏👏👏😅☝️
Now I gotta give you back to the streeeeeetssss💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
I am A Non Smoker, but this song amazing
We the best music
Lmaoo I will have to come back to this later..my son heard “bit*ch” and said WHAT!?  lmaooo  But the track sounds amazing!!
This had me dying ROFL 1:44
🔥🔥🔥
Gone be the Sugar Daddy’s anthem 😂 tricking & still alone.
Thank you fellas,,put a end to hot girl summer!!!!
getting soul for real "candy rain" flash backs
Love it🔥🔥...so smooth...👍
I hope in the environment cancel culture they don't get protested.  Personally the song is smooth, tasty, and chilled but that one word will give crazies all they need to try to cancel them.
Gay Porno ad 🤮
When I heard, "Smoking Out the Window," I was shocked to hear Bruno Mars reference to a woman as a "B!@ch in one of his songs!!" I love your music, but the references in this song seems out of character for you.
I love every, every part... This song is wonderful 🥺
SIMP ANTHEM 🤣🤣🤣🤣
god I love his music so much all of the harmonies the outfits the choreography😍😩
the lyrics! The dramatics! Paak on the floor!   I need a smoke !! More, please, more. Doing it old school in a whole new way!
I love this group!!!!
If this video had those light trails like in the 70s, I might mistake it that this is from that era.
No needed for dirty stuff because the song is so good.
Stop Ignoring ANDERSON, HE ATE
Man, another SPOT ON throwback. Love it!
The music is really pretty. Bruno is using his original band which I love the Hooligans. His mouth is a little raw with the B word. But, that is Bruno and this CD is going to sell.
anderson always doing the most, lmao love you
Trap 70’s damn it
👏🏽👏🏽
Yes...yes....YYYEEESSSSSS!!!!!
Yoooo!!!!! I love this song. The video is funny. When he said he wanted to die and fell on the floor and stayed on the floor until it was his time to sing again, I was done.
Bruno Mars never fails.... *Smoking out the window*
Damn it, they did it again. Love the 70s vibe
Wow🔥
Anderson .Paak is serving extra and hot in the most beautiful way   i absolutely love this music video
U guys got me cracking man! LOL 😂 exactly what we need in this not so out of the woods in the  Pandemic!
I know they had a Ball recording this album straight fire. I wish they would stop tease us and release the album already. I have loved every song so far.
Wow wow wow this is straight 🔥son I don't listen to r.b like that but damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
3k dislikes is from the ladies this song is about
I love this sm
"I saw you walking in the rain" 2021😂
Imagine this in an album
Shoutout from Moz🇲🇿 I knew u wo'd not disappoint 💪
Imagine with an album
I love how dramatic this song is I just love it🥲
I like how you said not to be dramatic then he just fell on the floor
BOUT TIME BRUNO START TALKING ABOUT HOW IGNORANT THESE FEMALES ARE
"she belongs to everybody" SHE BELONGS     TO THE STREETSSSSSS
เลิฟๆ😍💗
Man its so crazy to see Anderson come as far as hes come. Always loved how unique his voice sounded.  From solo tapes, to tapes with Knx to collabs with kendrick and dre, to groups formed with Bruno Mars.
The vibe, the music and the vocals, are off the hook!❤️💯 Nothing but excellence from these guys! 👍😍 Some of the words in the lyrics though😐, as a female, I don't appreciate use of the word b****. Kind of takes away from the groove. Just my opinion. Otherwise, this is the kinds of music and genre that hopefully will inspire other artists to follow.!!!!!💯
Yassss Silk Sonic  ♥️🔥
I love you bruno
Thank you very much my friend.
PAAK ON THE FLOOR IM CRYING
His voice like the same then n now🖤🤎
Sounds of my Generation!So Cool!
Album will be phenomenal
Omg🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why does this music video and song feel like a sketch from Saturday night live
Only tone deaf can dislike this piece of art....
Who the 3 thousand that diss liked this and how
She belongs to the streets! #Futurevoice
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏾😄
https://youtu.be/mVKPBRgukY4
Perfect work in the world.Perfect man in the world. Perfect team in the world.
This dude is smoking while hittin those notes, just wow
😍😍😍
Bruno in the house!! Smokin hot with 70s vibe!!
the only music that matters, til' today!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tru
Eles não erram nunca? 😍❤️
Oh the lyrics!!! ❤️
AWESOME SONG <3
From 1:33-1:46 insta classic. "Not to be dramatic, but I want to die" fine. I get it, but laying facedown while song plays, is Nexxus 6/next level stuff.
Love this
It was the whole song for me.
Bruno... What an Amazing Artist ❤️❤️❤️
Future is sitting in his car somewhere, smoking a cigarette... adding lyrics from this to the Gospel of Future
Andre 3000 wya?
I’m Glad they found eachother
ça aurait été tellement mieux avec des cigares  🤣
Too dope 🔥🔥🔥
🤯🤯🤯
It’s the “this bitch” for me 😂😂
silk sonic is the best event of 2021
I felt this lbs
Omg omg omg cada vez es mejor😍😍😍
Chévere
so , basically they was saying that  " SHE BELONGS TO THE STREETS "
GREATNESS!!!
💖💖💖💖💖💖
IN LOVE IN LOVE. Hopping to dance this in a club very close to someone HAHA.
Bruno Mars just like me fr
OMG! I love you Bruno Mars 🥰
greatest duo
This is hot. I wish a girl group would do a reply song!
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
More we want moreee
here for the music, but choreography is a bonus
Retro vibe with modern lyrics…INNOVATION, 70’s 80’s 90’s was the golden eras for RnB and Silk Sonic making sure we never forget that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why do their feet look big af tho
Não abriu o som, só imagem!
I love The Nutty Professor reference at 1:16. Hercules Hercules!!!👏
This is so good!!!!
Holy crap Eric (Bruno's brother on the drums) looking just like Bruno!!
so this is part two of natalie  isnt it?
Bruno on his knees! Those melodic harmonies…perfection! Old school vibe❤️💯❤️💯
they’re so satisfying... dare i say... silky
Okay I need a Silk Sonic collab with Stevie Wonder ASAP! We need to recognize these legends who paved the way for Silk Sonic before they leave this earth!
Choreograhy on point, contemporary mixed  mixed with retro ....... will be around for years to come.. let's go!!
It's hard to hate his songs.
1:19 favorite part
What a BANGER of a video.
This is 🔥 No other way to explain it
I loveeeeeeeee thissssssss
Love it.
hey what u smoking on there cause we need that feeling this Christmas.
Tem algum brasileiro aqui? 👀🇧🇷🎶
Amazing !!!
Loveeee youuu brunooooo
Oh Man....as usual this is great!!
Bruno muy buena canción
Yessss Bruno Tell it ❤️🚬🤣🙌 Paak on the floor 💀😂
Bruno Mars new songs are definitely much better than Ed Sheeran's. His new songs suck. Specially Bad Habits. Yuck.
goodshit
The lyrics have laughing so hard
This is awesome 👏🏻
These guys never disappoints.. I listen to their music while workin and I always have a good mood...
these guys working strenunously to bring  back that nouveau-motown sound  i hope it takes off, this music slaps
I hear Bootsy Collins sound influence in Silk Sonic songs. They have a genuine R&B sound and harmony that we been missing for a long time.
Bruno, we're looking out for the album with u guys
Ohhhhh ion listen to shi like dis but this ouuhhh and my dad finna love dis song
Anderson: Not to dramatic  *proceeds to be dramatic* 😆
Great song Silk Sonic… love how Anderson Paak reminds me of Bobby Womack….. props to the back up singers as well .. great collaboration .. love it
this is song is for gold diggers
Ehhh l’ll pass! . ..sounds like “Skate” slowed down after “Smoking”  hahaha!
.Paak fucking kills me
😍😍😍😍
I love it!!!!
s m o o t h
❤️
Si Bruno parang tahimik lang sa socmed or baka di lang ako updated sa kanya pero parang chill lang siya magugulat ka nalang may bago na naman siyang music. 💋
Bruno mars voice is so hot and sexy
"This Bitch...." never sounded so good...
🥰😍😍❤🇧🇷
shit soooo fireeee
Bruno Mars is basically saying she belongs to the street....read btw lines.
Whoever say this song isnt catchy or good is lying🤣..wonderful song
I LOVE FUNK MUSIC
This is the 2021 version of Oran "Juice" Jones, The Rain. ....walking barefeet in the street LOL
Dude that was so good wtf
As someone who showed too much openness to someone who consciously wrecked me this got me
When Anderson first sang using the "B" word. And I take note that he seemed to try to elongate it with ish (for dramatic effect). Bruno meant what he said; without using Ebonics. I almost turned to a pillar of salt. As a Christian enjoying all [edited] versions and genres of music. That's not what we mean in church vernacular when we say to one another, "Stay Salty!"
I love this
Aaaaaaaaa 😭😭♥️
So this is Grenade's remake
I don’t know why I’m still 🤣🤣🤣 this song is too damn good
Neo-Motown!!! It's glorious!
I see Bruno and Andy’s videos, I click.   Also I just know it’s going to be great.
its stuff like this that makes ppl start smoking lol
༎ຶ‿༎ຶ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ
not to be dramatic but.. im waiting for jungkook to cover this song lol
ไอเดียดีมากๆครับ
That makes me happy

TOTALMENTE DIFERENCIADOS, TEM NADA IGUAL. SOU MUITO FÃ PQP

Anderson is giving peak David Ruffin vibes and Bruno is Eddie Kendricks in his prime! Thank you both for bringing artistry back to the art of music!
This is the only reason why I'm alive, to hear beautiful music like this.

ILOVVEEYOOUSOMUCCHH💞💞💞💖
Their vocals. The oldie’s vibes. Wow. I love it, it makes me think I just took a dose of vintage and love.
I really can't stand Bruno
Saw this on an ad and had to stop and watch lol
Somehow I can't stop listening! So addictive
How much this song grew on me in just 24 hours is insane
Taehyung might watch this. I think he also imitated them.🤣
Swaying with the wind vibes is portrayed thru this song😂...am chillin
Spectacular!

I love you guysss ♥️
Dudes I know hate Bruno maybe it’s because us females love every song he puts out.. this another banger 🤣🤣

"Believe it can be done. When you believe something can be done, really believe, your mind will find the ways to do it. Believing a solution paves the way to solution." —David Joseph Schwartz
Bruno is on some drugs i swear he is so skinny
A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.
I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I cannot accept not trying.
Count your age by life experiences, not years. Measure your life by laughter, not tears.
The video is 💝🤭
If you never tasted a bad apple, you would never appreciate a good apple. Because, you have to experience life to understand life
Best lesson I’ve ever learned is that you can get replaced at any time, watch your back, don’t get too comfortable, be ready to move on.
Life is trial and error. Every relationship is not meant to work. Sometimes you’re just meant to learn the lesson.
Life is too short to wake up with regrets. So love the people who treat you right. Forget about those who don’t. Believe everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said life would be easy, they just promised it would most likely be worth it.
That’s harmonizing. Def don’t hear music being sang from the soul anymore. Anderson paak and Bruno killin the game.
Bruno is just different and I love it
Damn bruno
ok
album please.
It seems the 2020s still has great musics... i hope there will be more that these legends could share to everyone...
S/O TO MY EX HOW COULD YOU DIS TO ME 🥺

Oooohhhhh
Liquid Tight wrapped in Smokey Velour✨
This is just incredible, UNTIL they sing the B-word.  That ruined the mood.  A mix of Philly sound and Motown.  The title is borderline Weird Al and I would have used different words but that’s Bruno’s wit at work.  A 9 out of 10 for the B-word.and for the cigarettes.
Love u Bruno Mars❤
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 Anderson plays dead on the floor was the moment I died on the floor laughing my ass to death and the suddenly reappearing..oh my..the best moment ever! Luv the song.

Bruno Mars' Moves SMOOTHHHHHHH

Ah yes, watching this in low quality to feel the maximum time machine experience.
Jesus gave his life on the cross and rose again to forgive our sins and have peace with God for Him.  If you repent of your sins and return to God, you will be saved and have eternal life and you will be a child of God "by the grace of Jesus

They fu king knock it out the park on every song, that's real talent and organic music that will stand the text of time
The guys are bringing back the old 70s. Outstanding.
A work that only 3 songs were presented to us and that is already perfect. Thank you very much Silksonic#anderson.paak#brunomars#silksonic
This is a hit now in 2021 as it most likely would have been if it were made in the 70s. Truly a testament to time and a respect to modern and classic styles.
You would have thought bruno mars was with the temptations getting a record deal the way he going 😆
Linda música

Thank you Silk Sonic for another soulful and very entertaining music and video performance.  Mr. Bootsy Collins did the intro? And just in case nobody noticed, he was also represented throughout the whole video in a big way! All the stars in the background shining over the whole band  are all Bootsy, Baby!

Bruno looking 40 and 5 years old at the same time.
YES!!!!!!!!
Silk Sonic. The only people that can make me watch a music video multiple times in a  row and make me dance self consciously. Also helps that these songs are bangers.
Two words: insanely addictive!
This man can do no wrong!!!!

Dang, even the dance steps addicting. 😅
Eles 2 quando lança uma música juntos, fica muito foda ... Tinha q lança uma com Chris Brown 👊
The fact that any kind of music vibe fits to Bruno Mars when he starts on it. ✊🏻😩💚
And just like that, an entire new generation picked up smoking where they otherwise wouldn't have. XD
While everyone is being crazy about charts and rankings, these dudes be chilling, living their best lives and doing what they love
This is one Bad Ass Group! Love it 🥰
I am leaving comment in hope that whenever someone like it i will be reminded of this masterpiece
Maaaan. Silksonic making my pandemic worthile ngl.

They can be singing about anything and I would still jam to it😩
THIS IS SO GOODDDD
Im sat here in stitches, Anderson dead on the floor my god
Love it, feels like a quality SNL skit.
If "SHE BELONG TO THE STREETS" was a musical
I could watch Bruno Mars dance all day. The man is smooth af. Great beat!
Love Bruno Mars forever 😎👊🎤🎶❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When Paak pops back up from the floor… 😂 😂 😂
It is said any past time was much better than now. So is the music. Blessed nostalgia 👌🏾
🔥🔥🔥
Knew it was going to be a good MV when it looks like this.
This is the best duo to Grace this planet since MJ & Paul McCartney
yyyyaaaay
She belong to the Streets. 😀
I love how silk sonic is trying to bring back the golden R&B sound of the 70s and 80s, it's definitely time to have male, female, solo, and groups just dominate the R&B field again. R&B was responsible back in those 2 decades for the help of most babies made
La muerte, es uno de los eventos más grandes que jamás tendrá lugar en tu vida.   Afrontamos la muerte todos los días, consciente o inconscientemente de ella; la muerte acecha en cada rincón de nuestra vida. Como un león esperando atrapar a su presa, la muerte nos llega a todos en muchas formas y formas; aparentemente no hay nadie que pueda escapar de las fauces de la muerte.   ¿Pero sabías que hay una razón por la que morimos? La idea de la muerte con la que está familiarizado es solo la punta del iceberg. Mira, morimos porque hemos pecado contra Dios. La muerte según la Biblia es paga "porque la paga del pecado es muerte" (Romanos 6:23).Debido a que el hombre pecó contra Dios, vivimos en un mundo caído, antes era perfecto, pero ahora está en ruinas. Ahora que el pecado existe, Dios viene a juzgar al mundo con justicia. Está establecido que un hombre muera una vez y después de este juicio "(Hebreos 9:27). El estándar por el que te juzgará son los 10 mandamientos, la ley moral de Dios.   Él es tan serio acerca del pecado que le dio a cualquiera que pecara la sentencia de muerte, la Biblia dice que te la has ganado pecando contra Dios y cada vez que pecas, acumula su ira. "El alma que pecare, esa morirá". (Ezequiel 18: 4) El castigo son los fuegos eternos del Infierno "Donde habrá llanto y crujir de dientes" (Mateo 13:42)   Tendrás que enfrentarte a Dios el Día del Juicio.   ¿Irás al cielo o al infierno?   Aquí hay una prueba rápida:   1-No tendrás otros dioses delante de mí. 2-No harás ídolos. 3-No tomarás el nombre del Señor tu Dios en vano, porque el Señor no dará por inocente al que tome su nombre en vano. 4-Recuerda el día de reposo. 5-Honra a tu padre y a tu madre. 6-No matarás. 7-No cometerás adulterio. 8-No robarás. 9-No mentirás. 10-No codiciarás.   ¿Alguna vez has dicho una mentira? robado algo? usó el nombre de Dios en vano? ¿Alguna vez has mirado a alguien con lujuria? Él ve la lujuria como adulterio, “Cualquiera que mira a una mujer con codicia, ya adulteró con ella en su corazón” (Mateo 5:28). ¿Alguna vez has odiado a alguien? él ve el odio como un asesinato, "Cualquiera que odie a otro hermano o hermana es un homicida" (1 Juan 3:15)   Santiago 2:10 dice, "la persona que guarda todas las leyes excepto una es tan culpable como una persona que ha quebrantado todas las leyes de Dios".   No confíe en su propia bondad o buenas obras para salvarlo. Eso es como sobornar a Dios para que te deje entrar al cielo; Ni una iglesia, pastor, sacerdote o religión alguna. Ninguno de nosotros es bueno en absoluto, incluso los asesinos, violadores, incluso Hilter se llamarán buenos y tratarán de justificarse por sus buenas obras. Pero la biblia dice:   • "Pero todos somos como cosa inmunda, y todas nuestras justicias son como trapos de inmundicia; nos marchitamos como una hoja, y nuestras iniquidades, como el viento nos llevaron". (Isaías 64: 6)   La definición de Dios del bien es moralmente excelente y, por lo tanto, exige perfecciones absolutas. Nadie puede igualar sus estándares. Por eso Jesús dijo: • "Nadie es bueno sino solo Dios". (Lucas 18:19)   Si ha hecho alguna de esas cosas, Dios lo ve como culpable de quebrantar su ley y la Biblia advierte que los culpables terminarán en el infierno. ¿Serás culpable el día del juicio final?   "Porque la paga del pecado es muerte, pero la dádiva de Dios es vida eterna en Cristo Jesús Señor nuestro". (Romanos 6:23)   Dios envió a su Hijo a sufrir y morir en la cruz. Jesús tomó el castigo sobre sí mismo y derrotó a la muerte en la cruz; no por tu Bien sino porque Dios es rico en misericordia.  "Porque tanto amó Dios al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, el que en él cree no se pierda, sino que tenga vida eterna". (Juan 3:16)  Jesús resucitó de entre los muertos y venció a la muerte. Arrepiéntete (vuélvete del pecado) hoy y confía en Jesús y Dios te concederá vida eterna; también nacerás de nuevo.  Él te dará un corazón nuevo que desea la justicia, lo que es justo y un corazón que amará a Dios.  por eso Jesús dijo: "De cierto, de cierto os digo, que el que no nazca de nuevo, no puede ver el reino de Dios". (Juan 3: 3)  Luego, lea la Biblia y obedezca lo que lee.  ☆ ¿Cuándo vas a estar bien con Dios?  "Hoy, si escuchan su voz, no endurezcan su corazón como lo hicieron en la rebelión" (Hebreos 3:15) "Ahora es el tiempo aceptable, he aquí ahora el día de salvación". (2 Corintios 6: 2)   • "Tampoco hay salvación en ningún otro, porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres en el que podamos ser salvos". (Hechos 4:12)   Es tu elección. Los dejo con esto: "¿De qué le aprovechará al hombre si gana el mundo entero y pierde su alma?" (Marcos 8:36).   Si te estás tomando esto en serio, ¿te gustaría una oración? Esta oración no es garantía de que serás salvo, eso es entre tú y Dios. Sin embargo, me gustaría que este fuera un buen comienzo para su viaje.  "Padre, te agradezco por el corazón abierto de esta persona y le pido que se arrepienta y confíe solo en Jesucristo. También te pido que guíes sus pasos en su camino para que pasen de la muerte a la vida. En el nombre de Jesús Amén.

As always... Silk Sonic always amazed me with their complicated yet chilling music... What a chill...
Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and forms; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death.  But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23).  Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law.  He's so serious about sin that he gives anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. Each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42)  You will have to face God on Judgement Day.   Will you go to Heaven or Hell?  Here’s a quick test:   1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)   2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)   3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)   4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.   5.Honor your father and mother.   6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).   7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).   8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).   9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).   10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealousy desired what belongs to others?)   James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”    The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.   If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?    "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)   God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because you're Good but because God is rich in mercy.   “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)   Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.   Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.   Pray something like this:   "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). Today I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."   When you find time please read this, it's Christian principles for growth:   https://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/

This is going to be the best fucking album of the century
If someone was in coma for more that 20 years, and he woke up and asked: " what's going on with the world? " somebody must show him this video first before anything else, he will eventually conclude two things: this world still has some funky excellent singers and artists AND... what is a modern woman.
Im just wondering how bruno mars hit the high note while smoking hahaha great singer though

If "The Temptations" were rachet and slightly angry...
So is it cool to smoke cigarettes again? They do make it look so cool, and definitely not fake at all.
Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak
Silk Sonic
Chuck E. Cheese
Anderson and his THIS BITCH..' part and Anderson laying on the floor because he died killed me!😂😂😂 This song is so dramatic lmao!
Hope your trifflin ass is walking around barefoot in these streets..lookout! (Dramatic spin) 😂😂😂 i can't even, best line 😂😂
This song is the WHOLE ASS MOOD. So many quote-worthy lyrics!! And Bruno's falsetto... *swoon*
Can yall just drop already
Man....I love them....love this song. I'm ready for the album.
WHOA BRUNO MARS!!!!! JUST PURE TALENT!!!!!!!!!! IDOL!!!!!!!!!
Love it but I kinda miss his solo music 🤷🏻‍♀️
They are getting better and better It's just fire
Lyrics could be a movie script.
Thank God for Silk Sonic
Literally shivering while listening to this song!!! Woooooooh smooth kings! 👑👑
Nobody is making music like silk sonic... Legends
Lyrics so amusing xD
that was amazing
Best music
Cause she belong to the street
Every song of him is the SAME
This song is hilarious 😂
love the siggy prop
Even Bruno caught on to the situations we be having 🤣 I'm dead
Another masterpiece that will wreck my vocal chords and rupture my jugular veins to sing. 🤣
Don’t mind me just my 5th time watching it.
Oh sweet baby Jesus!!!!!.... If HEAVEN were a song, then this very song would be ETERNITY !!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥.... On repeeaat!!!!!! 😘😘🥳🥳
박형 나 울어...
I love this , this will be the album of the year
Cigarettes are bad.
I'm like this song
1:43 😂  Anyways, this song ISSA bop
i had to pause when paak dropped after "don't wanna be dramatic but i wanna die" and i had to pause again when he got right back up for the chorus to laugh my ass off
O maior cantor da atualidade. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏⚡⚡⚡
she belong to the streets - Future
I’m embarrassed at the number of times I have repeated this master piece🥺💯🔥❤️😍
First time listening…smoking cigarettes (I’m a healthcare worker) I hit the “don’t like button” Second time, I really listened to the lyrics (these guys a music geniuses). Third time, it’s all thumbs up. Why, it gets at the heart as to why humans create bad habits and do things that absolutely wreak havoc in their lives! Yes, you’ve done it again Silk Sonic. ❤️
As an immense fan of Retro Music and music in general, stuff like this that Silk Sonic are making is just too damn good for this era where most of the mainstream music is saturated enough to be forgettable after few days !
SMOOTH 👍🏽👍🏽😎♥️💕❤️🤩🥰😍
The Album is gonna a Masterpiece
In other words, she aint worth it. Focus on your grind gents :)
🤣 Yo, Anderson meant that...
heaven!!!!!!😍
Amazing!
Yall deserve #1 spot 🔥🔥❤🇹🇹
Wow
That corduroy suit looks fine, bruh.
When I heard "she belong to everybody" I knew this song was written about Brittany Renner
wait!!!welcome to 1921.home of rich music
Bruno is giving me Sammy Davis Jr vibes big time. Great video and track.
Silk Sonic is the new Temptations…
Love it 😍
“Not to be dramatic but I wanna die” 🤣🤣
Paak on the floor... STILL on the floor, has me *WEAK* 🤣
😂This is so funny and lovely 😍

In Short  She belongs to the streets 😺😺😺

Bruno don’t know how to make bad music. No groups out here period is touching Silk Sonic.
This is like modern male version of diana ross
Their voices are perfection..... especially loving Anderson's tone
Sooo freaking amazing!!!!!!!!
Freddie would be proud of 'em
They always brings back old vibe music 😩💙
Would have been perfect if they left the word bitch out of the song
"One things fo sho, she belongs to the streets" 🤣
“This b^%ch”
bruno mars gotta be the best pop star of this era
I feel sorry for those ppl who relate to this song
Amazing....amazing.......
EVERY SONG IS PERFECT! I LOVE BRUNO 😍❤️
브루노마스 넘 좋아^^ 사랑해요~
No doubt the greatest of this era! Bruno Mars is a true master!
The smoking of the cigarettes, Paak on the floor,  the talking during the song and how they each have solo parts just brought back how music is really supposed to be. Excellent work💚
I love bruno mars & anderson paak💕💕💕
WoW! Not to Be Dramatic, but this Song is Smoking Hot!! 👌💣 🔥
New IMMORTAL Song.. Love this😍

Love the melody and stage performance but why most of the songs today got to call women a bitch?  Even when women make songs now some are bashing men...or sexually explicit talking about the genitals...can we make nice clean non bashing non explicit songs with a nice melody like this? I am just over it and people you should be too... something has to change we must love each other and stop this madness..
Soul train….
Ayyy this is a whole vibe 🔥🔥🔥
Deym Love thissssss a lottt
это. просто. ахуенно
So smooooooooth....
Nostalgic vibe 💔
W😮‍💨
Shame. The melody sounds so sweet and classy but then they throw in the lyrics, "this bitch..." Declassified the whole song and made it crass and petty.
Such a 70's vibe...very cool!
THAT BOYS GOOD!!!!!
Can you please have a concert after this pandemic? Badly need one 😭 I love you guyyysss 💛💛💛
Waaa i loveeeee it😍😍
He literally fell down 'dead' and was back up to smoke out the window🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣That part was just made me LMAO💯
Get it my Ol Skool Souls❣️😊
1. The leave the Door Open 2. Smokin out the window 3. Skate  In the order that I like but the vibe from Silk Sonic is infectious man!*
as far as old school song goes, my dad would love to hear Bruno Mars and the gang serenading listening to them reminds me of the good days when was still young, listening Air Supply, Gee gees, those 80s, 70s songs that are classic on their own right
damn bruno mars and anderson collab is by far the best and the sexiest among others...
Ok..this song is a masterpiece!
Can’t wait to hear the full album!!  love you bruno
song is fire🔥
Great song. 😎🔥

I hope they would make a christmas song soon enough, three of their songs are nailing it already, cant wait if they do a epic christmas song😍😍😍
This has to be the most romantic song for a hoe. Indeed, Bruno Mars and company can do magic. They never disappoint.👌👌👌
Staring in the window, listning to the music  🔥
If " She belongs to the streets" was a song 😅
Even the video is smooth🤩
Int’l Sugar Daddy Anthem should’ve been the title
Yo this album going quadruple diamond don't know is that a thing but if it is this is the album worthy of that accomplishment
1:44 when she says she has a boyfriend 1:51 when she says she has broken up with her boyfriend
The Vibe resembles TREASURE
Music of champions!
1:19 thx
You go Bruno!! 😄 Bruno and silk sonic really understood the assignment. This is tugging heart strings. 🤧
This song is FIIIIIRRRRREEEEEE! Video is everything!!!
Magical! XD

Gold digger : 👀👀👀

I've literally had goose bumps the entire song.
My fav single of them

Impossível não ser apaixonada. ❤
This remember me The Jacksons!!!!❤
My man Bruno Mars can do no wrong! Definitely my greatest wish to see him perform live. 🇯🇲🇯🇲❤
Whaouh la classe😍😍😍
Paak: Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die~~ **dead**
Wanted: 2011 Bruno Mars. This 70's vibe it was cool the first couple songs but no where near as good as what he use to put out..."Granade" ..."Gorilla"... "When i was you man"..."Just the way you are".
Michael jackson would be proud of bruno mars
DAMN I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
i'm living for this music ♥
1:44 took me all the way out lol and the revival at 1:52. Another great hit! Can't wait for album!
อันนี้ก็อปเพลง สโม้กเก้อนิ ของดีเจอ๋องแอ๋งนิครับ

Sffffffffft! Puuuuffff!
Tell me why am I paying more attention to how they are dancing, got me thinking about the Temptations! Great job guys!! The singing, smooth dancing is on point definitely!!!!!
🔥
This beat is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
I am proud to say that I am a hooligan😨😨😨
bruno mars never lets us down
Máquina do tempo...❤🇧🇷
This is a song very reminiscent of how the genius that is Prince would write well to me anyway.
Sugar Daddies around the world about to be singing this song!! 😂😂😂
Dope way to say “she for tha streets” 🤣🔥🔥
I can't 🚫 stop watching. OMG 😱 👀
🤣🤣🤣🤣🥰🙌🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💚💨 🪟
Beyond Amazing 😍😍😍
bruno is back , maybe 4 song in 1 year ???:)
i feel like this is the first vinyl that I'll buy. seems to me that listening it on a vinyl is the way to go for this album
Completely irresponsible for them to promote smoking. 100,000s with start smoking and there is never a reason to refer to a female as "b". Sad. They could have done so much for a younger generation that needs role models
Bruno Mars wished it was a blunt so bad.
She didnt reply so here i am crown me guys
When Bruno said bitch I felt that
Bruno was like:  رحلتي من I'mma leave the door open إلى                        smoking out the window
Oh my!😍...these two talents!
Shhhhhhmokin’ out the window!
🖤🖤🖤💯
👎
To the ppl  that dislikes this song is straight buggin’.. and don’t have a good ear for music
Good song...the beat make me feel good.., good job bruno
Prince, chapelle, Stevie Wonder, Rich Cooper all in one. No words can describe this...
Já chego dando like, o som é muito bom! That sound is great!
They are too good bro 🔥🔥🔥
No no......don't ruin those beautiful voices with smoking
I really like Anderson Paak. Mixed with Bruno. Diabolical plan of awesome hits.
It's like I'm dreaming while watching this. 😇
The way i feel bad after laughing at the lyrics =((
Lmao they made a whole song saying "she belongs to the streets" 😭😭😭
WOW
Love this song😍
Definitely better than Skate
Bruno Mars Never Dissapoints!! Love the throwback 70's Vibes ❤

This is beautifully directed and produced
Classic!❤️
This song just makes me smile wide like an idiot idk why
IAM SO FASCINATED BY YOU!!
Wow these guys don’t make a bad song 👏🏾🏅

Bruno, Anderson and Silk Sonic got the classic vibe jams making everyone wanna bring the suede pants and shiny dancing shoes back 🔥🔥🔥💃
This part at 1:18 just hits so different
Cause she belong to everybody = She belongs to the streets
Another masterpiece song from master musician, Bruno Mars y'all.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE THIS VIBE OMGGGSYSHVDHZNEN
I could have done without the reference to a female as a "B"! I abhour it!
It's okay, but nowhere near as good, memorable or catchy as the masterpiece that is "Leave The Door Open"
5 years later someone will be listening to this masterpiece and will like this comment
Hey, someone in 2021 made a song I actually like.. Right on.
I'm digging those brown suits!
Best Group in a long while... SILK SONIC
Love it 🤪🥰
I CAN'T STOP CRYING LAUGHING AT 1:43 LMFAOOOO
It’s so good……but too damn funny at the same time. I mean listen to the lyrics (they’ll have you walking barefoot in these streets)😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
Wew Goosebump is Real Bruh
Aye anyone else noticed Bruno’s twin bro jamming out on the drums?
Lifffee!!!!
pretty much same vibes, great as always
These men are too good 💯
ROCKSTAR PLEASE ADD THIS SONG FOR RADIO  GTA 6 .
Godamn LeBron everywhere nowadays
Thanks for creating this song. I’m a music nerd and this is perfect for my playlist. Gratitude 🙏
another masterpiece!!!!! Bruno my man!!!
good shit , damnnnn
“Cause she belong to everybody”🥲😂😂😂
.Paak is so smooth
Genious!
Me transporté a otra época. Bruno Mars has hecho historia.
The fact that Arrdee's Flowers is higher on the trending list than this masterpiece is sad....
SUKS
The toxicity  with these two.
❤️
We should have to pay to watch this. This is like ET sht compare to music nowadays
.Paak: _"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die."_ Also .Paak: * lays dramatically dead on the floor *
Great job guys
I'm not feeling it I miss the old Bruno Mars
Darn it..late by l day and 4 m views later
Dayum..... you guyz are so so  good!
They all look like they’re having genuine fun while making timeless music. Cheers 🥂

Perfect song while smoking out window.....
A theme song for anyone that dated Brittany Renner 😂
🇵🇭 pride
New music i love this BrunoMars song❤️❤️❤️🇵🇭🇵🇭
Wow qué tremenda canción 🔥❤️🔥
i miss songs like this from you.
Haha this song is comedic and fire at the same time. I always hated anything to do with smoking till now 🔥
I saw the video in 240p for more réalism... it was hard in 70's
🔥🔥😊😊😊😎😌
Love everything they do!!   Especially in these tough times….This is real soulful music that everyone needs ❤️❤️.  Thanks Bruno, Anderson and the Silk Sonic Crew….Big Up👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🇯🇲🇯🇲
Oh my God
Idk the vibe is kinda nostalgic!
https://youtu.be/CXNjoe6hHWs
Watch this song become a TikTok trend now🙂
Ok, Anderson! This SS thing was cute. But now it's time to run...before you end up singin on a cruise liner.
THIS BITCH part ftw! LMAO!!!
os reis disto tudo
James brown and Michael Jackson are proud
this will defiantly generate meme levels of entertainment 😂
Silk Sonic might be the definition of soul
My old school soul has just been fed... No crumbs left 👌🥘🍲🥣🫕🍝🍜🍛
so this is all the singers on the video coming out as gays right? they act all femenine and they are compaining their woman's are empty their pockets and leave them "all alone smoking on the window" and i guess all of them in the window, smoking they realized "we dont need any woman! we can fuck ourselves!"
i felt like..i'm in the Moon!..,This genre is the best ever
They are true entertainers!
It’s just what I needed. I think Anderson killed this beat ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
God damn fellas, looking fly as fuck in those velvet suits.
Yeah no we city boys stay up.
The beat is sick!
うぉーぅ うぉーぅ
We only getting 6 other songs from the album but it's better then nothing 😭
Wow great
Why didn’t anyone tell me about the existence of Silk Sonic, these two together are everything!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This music video makes me more and more intoxicating.
Love it, so addictive! 👏💗
I'm blessed to be growing up with this music. Such a bop. Entire thing had my full attention
cancel culture running rampant for the smallest things and these mainstream pop dudes just drop a track about unloyal bitches while holding cigs hahahaha. I love this one, and the choreography in this video is so good.
OMG I love it! 💗
This week just got better. First Ed Sheeran and now Bruno Mars! Love their music 😎.
Ok, if we make a 90's Boogie Nights, please use Bruno and his Kats for the soundtrack.  edit: *bobbing* *my* *head* *swishing* *left* *and* *right* *like* *I'm* *front* *row* *sitting* *in* *a* *chair.*
Bom pra caralho 🔥🔥 o
Conscious Writing = Bitch was absolutely not necessary ... Do you have a mother, sister, Aunt? So you see them as "Bs" when things don't go thru...Got It,!!  Hope don't get caught up in a sex scam. Bye Bruno M✌️❤️
WOW 😵‍💫🤎
This made me laugh as well as love how EPIC these two are😍❤️😂
bruh... when I saw him dead on the floor, I died right along with him!! 😂😂😂😂
It ll be dope if bruno collaborated with bts
Expensive taste if you're  here.
It would be amazing to see them perform in Australia
Sammy davis son 😁
This is EXACTLY like "She belongs to the streets" if it was personified in 80s Soul/RnB song.
It's official Bruno and Anderson are making an album😉
These fools 😂🤣😂 clearly the spent 2020 together 😎
fuckin HILARIOUS 😂
udud ing jendhela
Bedehh mantubb
8 month for an album They will drop the album in 2023😄
bruno never disappointed <3
The visual of this video is such a TREASURE
1. How good do Black men look in brown velvet?! 2. This had no business being so funny.
Mr brown
this collab is modern day earth, wind and fire!!
smoooooooooooooth 🍃🍃

People: What is the secret for them to sing so well? Silk sonic: yes
Just the other night, she was grippen on me tight, screaming Hercules...OMG, the foot stomps 💥💥💥💥💥(Y'all, use your imagination)
They’re so mad 😭😭😭😭
Not the streets but giving her back to the City! sheesh
Great song again but absolutely no need for the B word. Absolutely no need for it at all! Doesn't add anything to the song. I'm not being a prude at all as my favourite singer,  prince, did plenty of cussing. It's like they thought,  what can we do to be dangerous. We'll make it cool to smoke, and we'll refer to a woman as a Bxxxx. Lads, you are so good , you're better than that. Can't wait for the album.
😎🔥
Smokin out the window. 90% of smokers do this when stressing out. They know their shit.
🔥🔥love it! Reminds me of boysIImen
Those adlibs and backup vocals just cured my depression y'all 🎤🎼🎷🎶🎵
This 🔥
Another great one Bruno, i love the styling. Reminds me off The Temptations.
sounds good but its a cigarette song...is this a commercial
never been a huuuuge fan of bruno mars, but silk sonic is SOMETHING ELSE.
👌🏻🔥
Paak on the ground 💀💀💀

Should this be the life theme song to P.J. Washington or Brittany Renner? You decide 🤔
Bro, I luv how Anderson just was on da floor 😂
She's from the streets
'She belongs to everybody' is a but harsh
Ain’t gonna lie this has been on repeat in my house since it dropped pure🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This Groove Is Massive. 😏
Yo he said " now I have to give you back to the city" bruhh lol
This is just great

앙둥아.. 이건 하지 말자

Okidoki

This is how you throw your hate to those woman who just take you for granted, while singing so smooth at the same time. Bruno Mars and the others are amazing here. 😍😍
1:04 sounds like a little 'Locked Out Of Heaven' throwback with the 'wrong' and the 'belong' melody. LOVE this song.
2017: Versace On The Flooooor  2021: Anderson On The Flooooor
Feel good song 😌

Man smooth as silk.
bruno’s vocal sick as hell
Magic
Hoes belong to the streets, Take cares of yourself brethren and don't play games with hustlers.
Alot of super talented artists can forget that one of the biggest requirements of being a super star is having great songs
After exploring 80s RnB music now 70s soul music I am waiting bruno would do 60s bossanova later
If u are lovesick......lovesick like Bruno
love with this song..🔥🔥🔥
So many haters and so many who don’t know good music
Amazing guys!!
They dragging that imma leave the door open sound….everything doesn’t sound good twice

😂 The choreography is brilliant
Did I just wake up in the 80's, coz this song says 1 day ago.

Восторг!!! Очень стильно, очень. Можно смотреть бесконечно!👌👍😍

Cheese (woahh) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the ufc Can’t believe it (can’t believe it) I am in disbelief This bi^^h got me paying her rent, paying for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (all alone) I am so cold, I am so cold You got me out here Smoking out the window (smoking out the window) Singin’ how could she do this too me? How could she do this too me? I thought that girl belonged too only me But I was wrong ‘cuz she belong too everybody, everybody Just the other night She was gripping on me tight Screamin’ hercules Hercules, hercules Got me in the club looking for a new love Someone help me please Help me please, help me please Baby, why you doing this? Why you doing this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die
bro love from 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩

Listening in 4m views
Anderson I love you 😘😘😘

bruno mars always making hits 😃
歌詞🤣 原來是工具人覺得空虛寂寞冷的故事🌚
Always a viiibe with Bruno Mars
Smooth falsetto 🔥🎤
Every piece of Bruno Mars songs are B-O-P
Ain't no way this bitch hurt u this bad that u dog her all through the song dayummm💀💀💀
Each song these guys release.. drops me right back to my late teens.. So good to hear properly arranged and carefully crafted tunes make a comeback in the mainstream, even if these guys have to drag the 70s back through the window ;)
It's the eye contact and ash flick at 0:34 for me
ADORO I SILK SONIC 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩👍
This man is the closest comparison to MJ, not Drake😂
Noice
The United States is the first country to use nuclear weapons! Who is the biggest threat to the world!
Thos is the best shit on earth 😭😭😂😂😂😂
Only silk sonic
Bringing back the 70s☺
This is the jam right here. Silky slick and smokin' on all sides. The Mars-Paak duo is the hottest thing right now and putting the soul back into black music. Thank fuck for that as I had began to lose faith!
Story of all the teenage at any point of time
I apologize in advance.... but this band could be named.. "The Black Shadow puppets" I'll see myself out..
This flavor is a different kind of euphoric. Bruno's songs has always been like getting high.
She belongs to the street😔
This is making me feel better about new music. Beautiful!
🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Insane!😍😮‍💨
Why i can't stop smiling...?😊😊😊
Has to be the best duo of this age💯
Thank god for music like this coming back 🤍
Only Silk Sonic can pulled out this concept and song
When this album drops, this will be near the top of every major publication Best Album of the Decade lists (Rolling Stone, Pitchfork Media, Billboard etc). Easily will be the best project of 2021. But could possibly be the best album of this decade
I just thinks when they take this video,  How many packs of cigarettes was burned🚬🚬🚬
This is the most ugliest MV of Bruno Mars so far!
👌🔥🌟 Really like the 70s feel that Bruno and crew are exploring... It hearkens to the soul era.
Anothaone!💯
Got folks auntie and uncle doing that let's make everyone feel uncomfortable dance again.
That other guy never smoked a cigarette in his life.
Well Dham!!
Bangsat 😭😭😍❤️
Bruno mars > The Weeknd
I love the Ole school sound! The lyrics are hilarious too! 😆
😂🤣 they are so funny, love 💕 Bruno & Anderson together, great video. All the musicians are great!
They did it again!!!
Sarap sa tenga, kilig T ,T
They singing about a hoe and its actually hilarious XD
He is the one👑🖤🥺😍
Live it, love it, love it!!!❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤
The Song 🎧 is quite ok 👌🏿
This is pure magical.. undeniable perfection in musical history.
certified hood classic right here
Brothers, who read this comment, I pray to God 🙏 to give long life to their parents 🙏❤🥰👍
Congratulations to everyone .  who comes in every single seconds.....

Again and again.... y'all just make magic 💯
This a club banger 2021!!!!! Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak aka Silk Sonic perfect combination they should've been together in the first place.
💖💖💖💖💖
The best thing to happen these past 2 years Bruno and paak
" I don't want to be dramatic"  **STARTS TO BE DRAMATIC**
it's not catchy but mysteriously addictive. these guys are the wonders
❤❤❤
alternate title: the thot song
This guy never writes a bad song
It's the left dancer for me
I love his song
This is calling a girl a harlot instead of a hoe to make her feel special 😂😂😂
BRUNO back with bangers !

넘오좋다

EL. DÍA TAN ESPERADO  12/11/21.....😎🌹😎🌹😎🌹🤡🇵🇪
The way that Anderson Paak popped up in front  of the camera at 1:51 after playing dead on the floor is so damn funny
damn
Lastly, I know his song titled finesse, it's been years ago. And know he's already back
Wonderful song ...🎼🎼🎼👍👍
4.3M VIEWS IN ONE DAY!!!!!🙌🏾
She belong to the everybody and the street
How to be broken-hearted. The rich way. 💰
Bruno Mars is just a pure talent. I love you Bruno...
This my favorite song of their 3 so far. Vibes too hard
Wow, Bruno at his best 😀😀😀
Smooth
That small moves with hip dancing 💃💃
I’m sorry but Bruno is a black man🤷🏽‍♀️😭
Ok this song is so lit. It's my new favorite jam.  Best part these badass kids running around my crib like it's Chucky Cheese.LOL.  We all know what type of kids he's talking about .  We've all seen these type of kids out in a public setting acting a whole fool running a muck. I've been to a Chucky Cheese with my niece and nephew  they've been those types of kids.  😠
Anyways, where is Mariah x Bruno collab or Ariana
How the fuck is every song soo smooth maaan I wasn't still over leave the door open and now this...
I truly admire Bruno Mars for letting the creative in him just shine through no matter how far it is from what is mainstream. A true artist.
Bruno is always the KING!
10000/10 SOOOOO GOOOD!
He died
Yeah I heard the sample..
Legends on fire
This song is soo Gooddd
Lmbo... I'm definitely buying the album. Yep, it'll play nicely on my phonograph.
Wow
Bruno Mars has never released a song that’s not lit 🔥
Oh my days. Hercules Hercules. 🤣 Even the Hairs on my skin are standing up and dancing. What a TOOOONE! This makes me so happy. What an amazing collection of super talent. Thanks guys. 😍
Neo Motown baby
Incroyable !! Qu'est ce que ça fait du bien d'avoir de la musique comme ça ! Même recette, mais si bon !!
Now
Everything that they have come up with is pure gold.
Bruno Mars is half MJ, and half dream girls
Another great song! 👍 I find their recent songs have the 70s, 80s flavour?🤔
Another one added to the Sunday playlist
몇 번째 듣는지 모르겠네🙈🙈🙈 내가 이만큼 수업을 들었으면 과탑 찍고도 남았겠다
Nice touch, "ufc" Big fan of both ufc and you.

You never failed me Bruno 💓 old style song with amazing voices . Salute

Very love bruno music like to 70th-80 style
We need that full album boys...ASAP
This album is shaping up to be the GOAT.
So good!
damnnnn🔥🔥🔥
what a way to tell a girl you a whore 😅
AHHHHH!
Actually for gold digger 🤣
Overrated....
A track about smoking featuring people who would never smoke
How could people dislike silk sonic???🤔
So far all 3 songs are awesome~ looking forward to the full album!
Why is the whole song and video a kiki!! LOL  I love how he's bringing back old music.
Smoking that fire
Feel likes Sha na na ,So cool
Guys makin history
Legend indeed
Instant classic.
They remastered the classic 90s. What a gem
Fire
Bruno Mars keep winning by just turning back the hand of time.
For a moment I thought I saw Tyler Perry out back
I really love the oldies concept...
Woohoo! Wow it is faultless early seventies. Bruce Lee with an afro and platform shoes. Bruno and Anderson are gods. Such a cool break from today's drums that sound like someone striking matches. For goodness sake light that cigarette using a lighter.
Too much cussing so  music destroyed once again by new wave of disrespect
The smoothest way to say someone belongs to the streets
Yesssssssss
1day ago and got 4.3M views,,  congrtas bruno
Another nice one  with great people keep moving
The lyrics and video sound/ look like an SNL skit.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCoZ8KFwxS00g2Vczq7qTpbA
this is so fun lol i love the song so much. they never miss
Friend: Damn bro what she do? me: 0:32
Walk it like  i talk it
this is gold ✨
“Give ya back to the city!”? Boys, I am a 70 year old woman, on my knees laughing - this is the Best, Best, Best lyrics and performance I have heard in Decades!!! Smooooth, gentlemen, just smoooooth😘
This needed to be the summer 2021 anthem, frfr.
🤩🤩🤩🤩
Oh my this song is 🔥 I didn't like the chorus him referring to her as a bitch, at first. I then realized, I've been there thinking "This Bitch"! 🤓 Their sound is unique and it totally fits them. I loved Anderson being dramatic and "dieing" 🙄 at the end. 😄 I got a feeling the whole Album gon' be nice. That "back in the day" smooth Sugar Honey Ice Tea vibe!
역시 브루노 마스!! Paak도 늘 응원합니다!!
RIP TO REPLAY BOTTON
Thank you to Bruno Mars and the other artist for bringing back soul R&B. Definitely needed this to come back. I can’t wait for the album
listen to this song while smoking out the window
Silk Sonic are the TP!!! Everything on this song is just brilliant  They literally hit the musical g spot everytime...🖤😭😭😭 love this track
70,80 years
The 2 unknow guys are amazing too Perfect harmonies ✨
Me gustaría que cantes "Rest of my life" para el día que me case con el amor de mi vida. Juntaré dinero desde entonces (aunque dude que pueda pagarlo)
Bang rokonya diisap dong
Creative geniuses😍
Alternate title: "She Belong To The Streets, The Song"
Instantly fell in love with the song
I lost it when Bruno said “ she belong to everybody” deadass acknowledging she belong to the streets meme 🤣
Everything they do is just heavenly, magical and mesmerizing.
😩🔥🔥🔥 Sheeeeeesh
Anderson paak is absolutely hilarious
Here comes the man who'll then disappear after releasing a song.
Wish "everybody" was replaced with a falsetto of "the streeeeeeets" and Future had a cameo.
Who cares they haven’t drop the album but I love it
no way. no way. no way.   totally awesome.
this reminds me some years ago to tavares, and Im a young person but I know about tavares cause my father told and showed me about them
Never realized Kevin Heart did backup vocals as a side hustle.
Is this a ninoy aquino reference?
That giving me pure black vibez,...the outfits....so cool💯
Best duo ❤️😂
2 Filipinos sangin like this?!...sounds like hawaii to me...nice combo and music
Legend
Is it just me or has Bruno mars lost a lot of weight.🤔
No Vinyl?
Lol this a cold song! I love it!!!
Well damn!!!.... Where can I find a cigarette that last a whole 3 minutes and never burn down to the bud....🤣😂🤣😂
Wow... Only Bruno can tell a girl she is a HOE in a whole different way
ohhhhhh noooo!!!! dayem   sooo good, got me straight laughing crying smiles, jammin …. Man u guys are the best.
Old school vibes 2021 they do it perfectly.
Man they got another one. Hi key the funny part of the whole song 🎵  is " Thisssss Bxxxxxtch got me" As a man I know exactly what that feeling is. It's alot in those two words but yet so simple. LoL
1:35 "not to be dramatic but I wannabe die....." --then goes ahead to lie on the floor🤣🤣🤣
Gods saves you in Jesus, trust in Him He wants a relationship with you and you can have that if you trust in Him and His sacrifice .His love if out the window it’s SO amazing he’s so amazing!
noo people it went out a day ago and I can't stop to hear this "someone help me please"
Extraordinary track, love every facet of this....including the Bootsie intro.  Not even really my genre of music, but they nailed this. With these two, the lyrics are always killer, no filler, but what is overlooked is the robust chord progression, bass lines and harmonies that mesh it all together. Very, very well done and would love to see more of this in the industry.
マーズウインド&ファイヤー
Fact : the song gets better every time you listen to it💓👌🏻
This is the best way of Cigarette Ads....hee
This songs amazing
Bruno is the man.

A much right woman.  Just as much rightly yours as well as anyone else. My late mother would be dancing to this plus laughing.   We love good music.   Keep it coming.
So far this song is the only one that Silk Sonic has released that I disliked. But I do like their suits.
magical
The Weeknd: " I GOT THE 80'S VIBES ON LOCK  Silk Sonic: "That's Cool We Got The 70's"!!
Like it. Bruno Mars and these guys are amazing.

Their song is so catchy man Ive listened all to their songs to leave the door open to this gosh 😭
Gah damn they SLAPPED shit. I watched it twice !
If I could like it twice, I would.
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
What a bop!
Great song... Perfect for the awards shows
My compliments, this is good stuff. I will be playing this a lot.
GUYSSS 1:20 got me in my vibezzzzz..that was sooo smooth
Wow..I can't believe I will be falling for rnb songs for real....tears 😭😢
Me: "You can smoke just air it out a little."  Bruno & Anderson: "This. Bitch."
Bro dat was the most fire shit I seen in my life 1:14

Cant wait to see the rest of album
Just think song spoilt with word bitch.remember this song in the clubs and no word of bitch and dont know why they put that word in.cant imagine it being played on the radio coz of that word,shame as guy got great voice.if they want to revive it then respect the previous singers which they should.coz addore bruno love his songs but this one im disappointed.grew up in the 70s and this is disrespectfull to that era and previous singers.
Bruno goated for what?
Good song and Music Arrangement. Sadly, Smoking is Bad, MV not good for Children to see :p
Bump bringing back the music that we always complaining that we don’t get no more so you lot better listen
My favorite part.... "This B*tch"  😂😭😆🤣
Does anyone else notice that Anderson Paak's part in "THIS BITCH ..." has more resonance than Bruno's? It is incredible how both complement each other, GOD
Bruno Mars is so cute 🤩🤩🤩💜💙💜😍😍🤩💙💚💚🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
😜🔥💨🏄🏾
Lovely song as usual

This performance rings bells about dancing church choirs that sing hymns with lite steps 🔔
El comentario en Español para decir que ESTA INCREÍBLE 😍😍😍
Man Paak. and Bruno together just makes so much sense
The video from 1:34 - 1:54 had me cracking up every time I watched it! Love the music and I'll be looking forward to buying the album when it comes out!  Anderson .Paak is hilarious!
I really like the music but I hate cigarettes
HERCALEESEE 📣💥💥🥰😂😂
When I'm 45 years old this will be my oldies
Love the music style and vocals but am i the only one who thought the lyrics is like lines for a skit or something😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you Silk Sonic for making the best music
Haces lo mismo que hacias hace 8 años
LSS PAREH 🤍🤍😻
Promoting smoking cigarettes.

So cool! Love the humour put in the video, the old velvetty suit, the dance moves, the falling on the floor..;o)) So funny love it!
Ooh la la! Noice!! Fantasic Bruno Sir!!
Anderson realizes he has no clock 0:36 XD
I like the sounds
Necesito este álbum

I thought there was no way they could top leave the door open but I WAS WROOOOOOONG
They should create  a band , them vocals together  is something  out of this earth
💞🎵💕
3 FOR 3!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Listening to this can be a therapy session for men😅😂😂😂
Not even into this type of music but smart enough to recognize 🔥 when I hear it.
I know I'm gonna get blasted with this comment but I wish it was just bruno and his hooligans singing these songs😔
I've been waiting for another absolute gem.🙏🏿
I feel so rich listening to this
This is everything
Bruno por ti le echo ganas a la escuela
Despite how overplayed Bruno is on the radio Sometimes he forget he’s really fucking good 👌
Please!  We need more symbolism.
Amazing  and great work
The smootest guys on the scene
Wait, she was gripping you tight and making Nutty Professor references? Y’all are into weird stuff.
this album gon be an instant classic😭😭
what a song what a song...Anderson and Bruno really such a killer combo!!!! *slow Claps*...the my fav record they released so far BY FAR what a smoker!!!! straight heat!
Diamonds on her neck diamonds on her wrist and im all alone!!!!! Never hit sooo hard 🔥🔥🔥🔥
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Uau... Musica e performance perfeita nos faz voltar no tempo um tempo maravilhoso de músicas boas que coral perfeito..
If the video is this AMAZING. I can't even imagine how they will perform live, since they seem to do a little twist somewhere performing live.
the manhattans?
I was only one hour late.
Disco is back
There is Something about Anderson’s Voice. ✨ Smooth
Imagine when they tour 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩.. the feeeeels.. gaddaaammnnn!
I love this group❤
Now THIS is mf music
Much love to you Anderson Paak. Your too funny and very talented. The rest of you are as well.
They spoke to Future before writing this song, I just know it
Yasssssss
Drop This Damn Album!
It's the fake cigarettes for me. They held them the whole time even when AP died lol ..🤣🤣🤣 I love it! You guys are Amazing.
😂😂😂😂 I wasn’t ready @1:44 it was so random but so clever
Anderson and Bruno should groove us more... This is smoking good piece of song... You remind me of Uncle Charlie
I've been listening this song for an hour and two....never felt it's enough, want more of bruno paak.
Damm….. I’m loving it..
3 /3 !! 🔥🔥🔥 this album about to be amazing !
Silk Sonic is insane! I've already started to rehearse this song! This álbum is só great to hear! And  also great to  play it!
I hope she out here walking barefoot in the streets is the level of petty I aspire to be 😂
Hola a todos los latinos que estamos aca por la buena música!!! 🎧
Yoo My Man ❤️❤️
Great Collab 👌👌👌❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏
Anderson .Paak estas completamente loco
THIS SHIT GO CRAZYYYYY
🔥 👏👏👏👏
All I know is, when they go on tour I HAVE to be in the number.
This was equal parts soulful and humorous. I was laughing and grooving at the same time. 😂😎
2:40 - 3:08 is definitely the best part of the song is so addictive bruno's vocals and they way he can easily reach those highs are amazing mind blowing. Simply love the song it's like a drug haha
*Anderson deserves an Oscar*
That vibe damn...AWESOME
😊
it's literally a song for a gold digger taking advantage...^_^
I had a girl who I thought belonged to me but now she's for the streets lol
"Not to be dramatic but I wanna die"  Just me everyday
I got a feeling this is gonna be one of those CDs where you can let the whole thing play. Each song will be 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. It's gonna win a ton of awards also.
Old School R&B flavor💕💕💕
Best song writing duo since Lennon/McCartney
This is what the Old Folks say this Shit is a Jam :)
Too much know
Imagine being Bruno Mars. Wow
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Wow, super jam😍🇿🇦😅🙏❤️💋🔥💝😂🙌🍔

As a senior I love the music but ditch the cigarette. Be a good example for the young and old out there.
❤️
thousands and thousands of years of music and this man, this MAN STILL finds a god tier melody?!?! HOW
They really don’t miss 🔥🔥🔥
Conta-se nos dedos os brazucas presentes por aqui...
Holy smokes boys
Fire
Bruno and Pa.ak have captured the past. They have found the key that takes them to the past to capture the essence, the feeling, the mood, and the soul of the songs from that era. The visuals, along with the flawless music, make this song a mental time machine. And the song is hilarious. Silk Sonic just nailed it with 3 hits in a row.
Great song. 😎🔥
Love the rythm of this song....
I fall in love with every song from this band
Why listening to Bruno Mars and silk sonic songs are so satisfying 😍🤩
Aayeeee!
Bruno, Anderson and the band are absolutely talented ! SIlk sonic is just incredible
On repeat until I know every word
Whoever is producing these Silk Sonic tracks gets a gold medal in life 🥇
can I just say : love it love it ! love this song!
These guys haven’t missed yet 😭🔥 shit is crazy
Best combination since tacos and tequila.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽😊
of my lord, this man never misses
🔥🔥🔥
Sucks 😂😂😂
I need the album ASAP
Yall need to stop playing and just drop the album cause obviously the whole album is going to be a banger
I feel rich when I heard your songs❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
the best thing Bruno did was team up with silk sonic! my god what wonderful songs one after another!
Very Cool..but I don't smoke..
THEY JUST DON’T MISS!!
10/10 awesome guys, love it, love it
THIS! B*TCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOT ME PAYING HER RENT!!!!!
AMAZING
Bro will never fall off
We are warning the world! The US government is ready to use nuclear weapons! The end of the world is coming! Store necessities quickly! Cash out and leave the stock market!
I’m about to get my girl pregnant on this song.
I feel this New Song and Music abut for my comments …『That’s Completelly and Masterpiece.♫』
This is gonna be a no-skip album. I know for a fact.
This is  a certified vibe.
The "This Bitch" bout to do numbers on TikTok but Bruno's voice is soo heavenly 🔥
Ahhh I love this song
Loving it
WOW JUST WOW OLD SCHOOL ALL DAY
Bruno Mars Is Amazing I Love All His Songs 🎵 I Wish I Could See Him In Concert 😍 He Can Sing With Anyone He 💯🎆
Can't wait till these collaborations are over and Bruno Mars just goes back to his non-silk sonic days. Just not feeling these songs, sadly.
They are some fools 🤣
This Album is going to be biiig
sz
Bruno Mars your songs are enchanting you sing with your soul ❤️ congratulations I'm from Brazil unfortunately we lost a singer Marília Mendonça
Liked without hearing the song. Bruno just never disappoint
That last move sealed the deal!!! 💯 Another Hitter and I'm here for Anderson Pakk laid out and then pops back in the screen Sanging!!! 🤣❤❤❤❤❤❤
this reminds me of the old days and how most music on the radio was funky as fuck for a moment
It’s either heaven or hell and if you haven’t repented then it’s hell not just for a long time( we’re talking about billions of years) but for eternity(longer than trillions of years!) in hell! Hell is hot and there is no water. There is no life in hell. It’s a place that you go because of your sin. Don’t be mistaken the worm doesn’t die in hell and it’s you don’t get stronger. You suffer for eternity. There is nothing to look forward to other than suffering. That’s why it’s important to live for and worship God! He is the source of life!
iconic ❤❤❤
Así se hace causita❤️ 🇵🇪
And Welcome to" This is not your first time watching this" moments.
the bass and guitar in Silk Sonic songs are just too good
gotta start the #HardOnThots movement again
they are having fun! and im hear for it!!!
I want to buy their album on vinyl, cassette, and cd
1:43 KILLED ME 🤣
❤️
song is really great that nobody in the comment section is complaining about them holding and smoking cigs :)😀
smokaaah ~
screaming Hercules!!!!
Not long enough... Can't get enough... Will never be enough
D’Mile 🐐🏆
Tbh Bruno Mars is the only person worth seeing in concert anymore
Mais alguém do 🇧🇷 que também viaja ouvindo essas músicas? 😍💫
Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak collab is the best thing that happened this pandemic. All their songs bang hard! Their vocals are no joke!
❤❤❤❤
new boy band, Bruno Mars, Anderson and Silk Sonic

Glad to say i was here when this came out
Smell like a grammy
I FELL IN LOVEEEEEE😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰😍🥰🥰
These guys are unstoppable
This is so good. Funny and omg the vocals 😩
studio must have smelled terribly
Song was totally ruined when singer with glasses said word BITCH!!! They would never have said that in the 1970s. Please bruno re,record again without that word please!!!
Omg the chills🥶
This needs Akeem Ali, Snoop dogg, and Suga Free on the remix
I don't smoke but this song makes me want to smoke out the window with a coffee beside me
We hear for all this!!!!!!!!! Album is preordered!!!!!
담배들고 노래하는거 개깐지
I was definitely not expecting these lyrics but I'm here for it 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Paak has me dying laying on the floor like that
♡♡♡
How did Bruno get into formation so fast after Anderson’s first This Bihh 😍😍😍
Diamonds and the club….tired lyrics. I appreciate the choreography, brings me back.
Such a FanGirl for Silk Sonic🤩😘🚬 #Hercules🍆
I ask you for a minute of your time to help me fulfill my dream of being an artist for the short time I have left in life I have cancer and I am disabled without friends why I cannot leave my house because of the bullying that they do to me why I was not lucky enough to have a good physique but I love myself as I am because that was what I got blessings and God bless you all ...
In memory of Will Smith... 😆

This is definitely another hit👍🏽👍🏽❤❤❤❤❤
it would be so hard if they said "she belongs to the streets" and it would rhyme better too
Awww, love it..
People are gonna freak about the cigarettes. 🤣
Grown folks music  I love it and that shits real lol
Epic
The retro is solid. The people who think this is new and exciting, rewind.
Im happy to see Lebron James being on backup singers. Good job LBJ.. nice song by the way😅❤️
Esse cara é  diferenciado  D++++ Som desse cara Cósmico.  Ouvindo  agora 01:11 Hrs  06/11/2021
I like it oh yeah
Another masterpiece
This songs is just talking about girls who belong to the streets, in old school form
This song would actually be WAY better if the lyrics weren’t just comic trash. Use your awesome skills to write proper lyrics for this awesome song!! The appeal of this song is now DRASTICALLY limited… in audience and time.
This is real art!
1:44 he be doing the ninoy aquino challenge
I AM LOVING THIS ALBUM!!!!
What is Smoking?

Dioooos me encanta el estilo que conserva 🙏✨ y la canción no se diga
This is the most soulful way of saying “BACK TO THE STREETS YOU GO, CITY GIRL!” 😂👏🏽🔥
These lyrics are just as ridiculous/true as those from classic jams of the 60s and 70s. So good.
The best music 🤩
0:30 man that's smooth
Amazing Style 🤩

https://youtu.be/Po4HYC1yCg4
i haven’t been so excited for songs since this collab
Loved this more than Skate!
The fact that man actually played dead 😂
smoking in air, 70's are back
Skate was trash this is a great comeback 2-1
Not to be dramatic but I would literally die for them
It feels modern and nostalgic at the same time ❤️how did they did it??
I’m so glad the other fellas are getting they shine too.  This is def a great bop
🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼 damn with these bangers…
This song is so fireeee!!  Anderson lying on the ground was too good! 🤣🤣
This is hands down the BEST music video I've seen in a while.
on Repeat!!!!!
I’m loving this old sound rounding back into popularity. Good vibes love these guys
Smoking out the window??? I hope it's nicotine and not the ooh wee.
This song & video make me so happy!  Those voices & those dance  moves! Can't wait for the album next week & can't get enough of Silk Sonic!!!
😍😍😍😍😍
Song is perfect.  Just missing Lil Duval talking smooth on like 90’s R&B break.
I will always say it, what a way to return the style of the 70 '! ... none could have done better than them. :')
🔥Hit🔥
😎😎
Wait a minute, this love started out so timid and so sweet But now she got me smokin’ out the window  Must’ve spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany’s (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin’ ’round my whole crib Like it’s Chuck E. Cheese (Woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can’t believe it (Can’t believe it) I’m in disbelief  This bitch got me payin’ her rent, payin’ for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I’m so cold, I’m so cold You got me out here  Smokin’ out the window (Smokin’ out the window) Singin’ “How could she do this to me?” (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong ‘Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  Just the other night she was grippin’ on me tight Screamin’ “Hercules” (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin’ for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin’ this? Why you doin’ this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  This bitch got me payin’ her rent, payin’ for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I’m so cold, I’m so cold You got me out here  Smokin’ out the window (Smokin’ out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin’ “How could she do this to me?” (How?) (How could you do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me (One things fasho, one things fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) ‘Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong to) Yeah, she belong to everybody That girl there, she belong to everybody  (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin’ ass is walkin’ ’round bare foot in these streets Look out  Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain’t right here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  Smokin’ out the window Singin’ “How could she do this to me?” (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) ‘Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong) Yeah, she belong to everybody She belong to everybody Ooh
nobody talking about how the choreography is on point and fire. they should release choreography version and I'mma love to see it.
Me and Silk Sonic need to collab soon
The no autotune pitch correction, no filter, pure vocal. Magnificent.
Music 🎶 with a bridge in the lyrics 💪🏾 relief to my 80s and 90s ears. Can't wait for the LP
I don't know if I should laugh at the lyrics or two step vibe through this record
Thanks  Thanks  👏👏👏🏾👏🏾
They are grrrrrrreat 💐✨
What happened to Bruno Mars looks? He aged a lot and loss too much weight. I hope his okey.
Awesome.
I can’t stop laughing ANDERSON sir why you on the ground like that lmao
There needs to be more r and b music...
Def on some Temptations  / Four Tops throwback..  and its fire. 🔥
Im diggin it
Wow!
GOD FIRST ALWAYS
It’s funny how I just see Anderson flat on the ground then two seconds later he pops out of nowhere  1:45
But i was wrong, she belong to everybody 😭
love it.just great
Every song they make is a hit ! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 BRAVO!
YO WHAT IS THIS VIDEO AND FRAME QUALITY
the song of a sugar dady?
Un grande con apariencia de joven.
This group is just insane. ICONIC!!!!
My mom loves this
WOW what amazing song is perfect
Niceeee
They are going to catch hell for that ‘this bitch’ stuff. I don’t think it’s going to go well. Bit of a blind spot there. I’m not woke. That shit just don’t fly these days.
Yes. The music industry needs to be about MUSIC. Thank you to Bruno Mars for making MUSIC 💗
my shoulders moving on their own!
I can't wait More for the full album
The 9.4k that didn't like the song was the chicks they was talking about. Simple.
Always great vibes :')
80's 90's vibes huh cant stop listening to this so smooth song
what a beautiful song! i like it❤️ Hello from Indonesia 🇲🇨
It's a really good song until you realize that it's a song for someone who belongs to the streets which makes it much more hilarious
Hope they do different versions like they did with Leave the door open 😍❤️
0:31 is a meme potential
😍😍😍
Pak and Bruno couldn’t make a bad song even if they tried .
🗣Anderson Paak! This guy is dead serious!
Future: She belongs to the streets  Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic: *writes this entire song*
Wish they stop 🚬..save their voices
❤️❤️
HOW IRONIC!!! This song dropped at the right fucking time i cant believe it!!! xDD best friends just realized they were both played by the same girl.. that is playing around with literally every single guy she knows    We had therapy session .. and then suddenly this song popped up on my twitter!!!! 🤣🤣
Waiting tiktok will ruining this song 😏
😂🤣😂🤣 not Chuckie cheese!
The black face is over the top. . . .
Instant BOP!!!
1:37 is my favorite part
Casi perfecto 👌🏻 pero esos cigarros le dan al traste
Hey now, they done did it again
Another masterpiece👌👌👌👌😎😎😎
😍😍
Another hit! Bruno mars is the greatest
This is what happens when you “Leave the Door Open” 😂
https://youtu.be/3pvPgOsxwio
Incredible 🤯, I can’t wait for this album !
Parece até propaganda de cigarro kkkkkkkkkk mas seria a melhor propaganda com toda certeza
The direction of this video, the aesthetic, the choreography, the vocals, the editing...it's all *chefs kiss*
Too bad such a nice song and video clip is still promoting unhealthy ancient habits. Hundreds of thousands of ppl die each year from smoking. It`s 2022 almost, wake up !
ชอบมากกกกกกกกก
Anderson's head popping in with the "This Bitch..." then dying and resurrecting in time for his transition. 😂😂😂
What a banger this is. Come on smooth as mother flucker
Anderson with the “this bitch” was so unexpected but oh so perfect!!!  This is 2021 Oran Juice Jones “The Rain!!!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
but fr, this man NEVER drop a bad song. im so sick, i hate here. man you can't be that perfect, my heart can't deal it
Another banger
Absolutely love it!!!!
Love the retro sounds and moves. Not quite getting the cigarettes. Lol.  Good song!!
I dont like the explicit lyrics
Everything they do sounds amazing 👏
I don't know how it's possible - considering that I'm black from the deep south - but Bruno Mars is "blacker" than me.   The level of soul coming from this man is from before my time.
Man it's only 2021 and we're already getting the album of the decade
I just watched this whole ass video as an ad and it was SO GOOD! I'm super excited for this album to drop!
Hola Bruno, eres muy perfecto, te amo 🥰🥰
🛐🛐🛐
I died right after Anderson resurrected himself... lmao   I can't! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i love this
the next MJ
I love it when they said, "This bitch got me paying the rent and paying her bills!!!" Lol. Well, they did leave the open and they did say how good she can skate. I know they wish they kept that damn door closed. Lol
I love you 💜
Awesome melody and production!
Bringing Soul and Funk back !......yeah !
“THIS BITCH-“
I hope Silk Sonic does not break up after just this album. I hope they are able to compromise and make more good music together even after "An Evening with Silk Sonic." 🤍 If not, let us cherish this gift of a historical music moment forever and keep this in our hearts and souls eternally. 🎶 We are all blessed right now to be around during the "Silk Sonic" decade.
almost 1day million views again and counting. Bruno Mars Thats Krazzzy
Stop makin folks wait!
This is literally "She belong to the streets" in song
Mds como eu amo esse homem senhor
is it just me or is it just Silk Sonic's style to always leave us hanging at the end of their song craving for more, being more excited for the album and just can't get enough of this vibe?!? 💖 My goodness 🤩🥺💕
''THIS BITCH GOT ME PAYYING HER RENTS AND PAYING FOR HER TRIPS , DIAMOND ON HER NECK DIAMONDS ON HER WRISTS '' Damm BRUNO 🔥🔥
If we only loves each other how we all loved weed
I just wish some of the old schoolers were still here to hear this wonderfulness. They would lose! their!! minds!!! about the harmony and steps.
Bruno mars don’t have any idea about bad song
DIS BISH got me paying her rent ahahah
Smokin' bad. Song good.
Christmas carols💖
Kickback 🎶💯🔥
Can’t wait for the album 💿 🤎🤎🤎
How can you dislike this? Vibez.
Bringing back that soulful style is classic, what a genre to get the 20’s into! To Mars & back👊
the smoothest song I've ever heard about a girl belonging to the streets
BRUNO IS BACK
มาเล่นคอนเสิร์ตเมืองไทยบ่อ้ายบรูโน่

Man listen…. 🙏🏾
When is the Tour 👀
WOW SOUL TRAIN 2021&ITS COOL & IT UMM UMM GOOD👍👍👍👍
Hey mehn they on the something here🤣🤣
Why couldn’t you just say woman instead of bitch. That killed the song, I guess you didn’t get memo.this comes from a place of love.  I wish you all the best.  I think y’all are beautiful artist don’t scar your own self, there are enough negative people to do that for you. Be blessed. Penni

Perfection
Wow another good song..this song made me low key laugh though. Is it just me or Bruno Mars looks like he lost a lot of weight?

How many people are listening this masterpiece in the first week?
This joint hard!
Its all about the old vibes ✨

MICHAEL JACKSON 🎼🎶💪
The beat is amazing, the vocals are superb but the lyrics aren't exactly what I was expecting.

These niggas don’t miss
😭🔥 so fye
Okay, I’m on my 4th time reviewing this video I love it. Except for the B word but I understand their artist. With Bootsy Collins starting  it off  in the beginning of the song. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anderson paak too! Silk sonic was a dope collaboration w all the artists involved
I effing love you guys!! So damn refreshing!! Thank you!!!! ❤️🎸🙏👍❤️🔥🔥🔥
I LOVEEEEE

Another Winner from Silk Sonic!!
Woowwwwwww hay algo que bruno Mara no haga bien ??? ✨♥️
beatufil good song!!!! 1000000000/10
Bruno in his BAG here good lawd!!!
They are so crazy cool with their Pips, Temptations and O’Jays moves! Every time one of them say “this bitch” so seriously I scream laughing. Shyt funny as hell!
te amo Bruno <3
Enjoying the song and laughing at Anderson on the floor 🤣
Fantástic Song!! 👏
Pela mor bja alguém com bafo de cigarro num da mais tamo em 2021
Love it. #Goodmusic🥰
Yooooooooooooooo if their album is only 3 songs. I would like to know how I can I give you my money NOW!!!!!!
YOU'RE THE BEST ARTIST EVEEEER, I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART BRUNO 😭💘
I think lots of folks are gonna be pissed at the "This bitch..." use, and to me, lyrically this song seems like they had an idea..."Smokin' out the window" for a song and struggled mightily to come up with the story around it. The verse structure and bridge is kind of a mess. I love the music and the revival of pure 70's Soul sounds these guys are doing on the three songs they've released so far, but this one, in my opinion, is the weakest.
Holy crap! This was FANTASTIC!!!!   #BRUNOMARSICONIC
I love it!!!
Yes too, Im up to the challenge Yours truly Violet
Bruno just moved up to favorite artist all time passing Chris brown
Okay YouTube algorithm off because this should be #1
These guys make magic together.
PLSSS WHY DID HE COME BACK INTO THE CAMERA LIKE THAT LMAOO love these two
Absolutely great!!!
Always a pleasure.
OMG, they are so ignorant! Lol.....
Omggg ❤❤❤❤
Bruno can sing about boogers and it would still be amazing
i love this so much
These dudes are Special 🤌🏾
Perfect tongue in cheek retro.
Omg just when thought it wasn’t hope to listen 🎧 to real music again! Thank you Silk Sonic for blessing us with this!
Esse cara só faz perfeição pqp ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤💕💕💕
I'm 65 and I just love these guys.
Thanks for bringing back MUSIC!
hermosa cancion la verdad
Philadelphia Soul!
This is gonna be the band of the decade
✨✨✨✨
You guys are just too much... I love it and you too.
Do you really have to call the woman "bitch" you can do better than that
I’m dying laughing 🤣😂
I love Bruno Mars 💘!
This song is a legit Vibe Man
yyds！
Perfect Bruno Mars I love I like👉♥👈
Woooooohhh
Imagine these guys performing half time show of te superbowl?
This b**ch got me paying the rent, paying for trips....man I felt the Newports in his voice

Paak... I been tryna tell’em...🔥🔥.. congrats comrade..(that Ye DrinkChamps had me)😎
SHE. SAID. YESS!!
0:32 got me weakkkkk 😂😂😂💀💀
My mom: *walks into my room* Later, my mom: *leaves without closing the door* Me: 0:32
Amazing
11/12/2021 is when we'll FINALLY get to hear the full album!  I've been waiting for way too long for this, and it's going to be amazing...3/3 so far!
Eu oro toda noite para uma música minha estourar, Sei que algum Dia Direi, Não Foi fácil, Mas Consegui 🙏🏽🙌🏽FÉ uma dia chega o dia 🤩
As much as I like the vibe, Bruno’s voice, the beats… the lyrics giving me super fk boy feel 🤔 😒”I’m gonna give you back to the city?” Seriously? 😑😬😬😬
T H I S   B I T C H
FIRE AS USUAL🔥🔥🔥
Who are the 2k ppl disliking this? They need a hug 🫂
I frckn died when Andrew lied on the floor 💀 Also the guy on the left was definitely feeling this song, but honestly tho who wouldn’t 😌😌🤎💛
I get an Average White Band vibe.
I just LOOOOOOOOVE them together 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥
he sings "here I am all alone" as Anderson is playing dead on the floor lol absolute perfection
Another hit! Love the music and video imagery
so beautiful song
Silk Sonic is the best thing to happen in music in modern history.
Bad jam pretty good, really Hot Damn it's kinda cute and funny at the same time. So keep the hits coming for you guys are on the path of no return so just sit back and enjoy the ride the Sky is unlimited to you both.😍💖💯🎶🙃 I just can't help myself 👋😎
0:32 this part crack me up 😂😂
Such good vibes from Bruno's music
Man, people don’t give enough credit to Anderson. He is a absolute beast. His groove and musicality + Bruno’s voice and showmanship is probably the best thing that happened to (real) pop music since MJ.
This song came at the perfect time. Bitch got me smoking out the window for real!
holy fuck this is crazy good
i think they are gonna win a grammy forsure
Meh.
This album is going to be massive…clean sweep Grammys
Damn, Old School! New School! HAPPY As I Can Be!!!!!REAL MUSIC WITH LYRICS to BOOT❣YESSSSS🎵🎶🎵
This song me want to smoke
This is soo fucking good. I’m disgusted 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Duhhh!!!!!! 🎧
I did not think this song would slap this hard
Dude, Anderson Paak is the REAL talent of this pair
Great song... yes, Cheesy?... fucking YEAH!!, but guess what? it fits 100%.
Be good bitch by broke the tasteful musician's heart so you could pay your rent.
Ame¡¡ love them together they are soooo smooth💜🤩🤩
nothing beats there first song. it ain’t it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0LRarSRVno&t=11s
YESSS UGHH AMAZING
Yea so this is very similar to Lonely Island - 3-way (the golden rule) except slightly slower. Put playback speed at 1.25x to see.  Might wanna pick less famous songs to be derivative of or at least pay Justin Timberlake / Lonely Island for song writing credits.
Holy shit this is so good. Might end up being the best album of the year.
Regresare por ti hemosa musica💜
OMG I LOVE IT😍 BRUNO YOU RE SO 🔥
GOOD
*My kid’s birth certificate*   Mother: Me Father: Silk Sonic’s album
This lyrics is very weird for 2021 and the melody seems a bit redundant next to the other songs
KUYA KO YAN❤️🇵🇭
is it just me or does this song BANG ON 1.75 speeed
This B.... got me smokin out my window ova here too!!
Classic.
That's how every boyfriend feels when something like this happens.
Now this is meta 🥰
LOVE THIS SONG! Definitely getting the album!!!!
When is the album coming out??? Every song they've done has been a whole vibe!!! These dudes are amazing together!!🎶🎶🎶🎶
我同事今天和我说起她女儿的事。她女儿在上海音乐学院念书，发生上海踩踏事件的那天晚上，本来和她男朋友要去看灯光。在路上她们遇到一个没有穿鞋的老人，这大冬天的，觉得老人很可怜，就拉着她男朋友去给老人买鞋，又给买了一些吃的，回来又把鞋给老人穿上。  然后看天黑了，就和她男朋友说，别去了，肯定不亮灯，回学校吧。回学校后，还告诉她的同学说，外滩不亮灯了，别去了，所以她同学也都没去。  第二天发生悲剧后，她他同学纷纷感激她，问她怎么知道不亮灯的？她说，自己也不知道为啥那么说。  一念善心，有大福啊！  二  我老公家妹妹的，前夫的爸爸，昨天去世了，退休之前他是我们这广播局的局长，提拔了一个年轻人当副手，结果这个年轻人忘恩负义地暗箱操作，用各种关系，把他排挤出去了，自己当了局长。他爸爸一下就给气得住了院。  这个年轻人当了有2年左右的局长，有一天去医院做前列腺的手术，当时请的北京有名的专家，结果没想到这么个小手术就死在手术台上了。  他爸爸人还是不错的，还一直捐助几个大学生上学。但是我听说他有个红颜知己，好了不少年，他爸也没离婚。被人整下台，跟邪淫可能也有关系吧。看来善恶都有报，两不相抵的。  三  刚刚一位朋友打电话给我，说她弟弟与一位女孩谈恋爱，女友已经怀孕两个月了，看好了日子准备办婚礼了。结果女方家嫌他家穷，故意设置障碍，要求三天内，拿十万元彩礼过去。超过三天，就带去流产。家人怎么都凑不够，结果女孩就上门骂上了，说未来的公公：“以后有我没他，有他没我！”  接着这位朋友说，话说回来，这事是自家招来的。原来她弟弟谈过几个女朋友，家里都不同意，不是嫌人家个子矮了，就是说人家不好看、，家境不好之类的，人家女孩怀孕了，让人家去流产，先后让人流了四个孩子。  现在好不容易找到一个一家子都看上了的，家境也好，个子也高，人家反过来了，拿流产相威胁，眼看孩子就保不住了。而且这还没过门呢，就跟未来公公势不两立了。
This guy made himself a second player which makes him first great job 👏 👍
Amazing song 😍😍
Bruno, haven’t you learnt from Natalie?
[Intro] Wait a minute, this love started out so timid and so sweet But now she got me smokin' out the window  [Verse 1: Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, & Both] Must've spent thirty five, forty five thousand up in Tiffany's (Oh, no) Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (Woah) Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC Can't believe it (Can't believe it) I'm in disbelief  [Pre-Chorus: Anderson Paak & Bruno Mars] This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson Paak] Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window) Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could she do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody  [Verse 2: Anderson Paak] Just the other night she was grippin' on me tight Screamin' "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules) Got me in the club lookin' for a new love Someone help me please (Help me please, help me please) Baby, why you doin' this?

(How?) (How could you do this to me?) I thought that girl belonged to only me (One things fasho, one things fasho) But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong to) Yeah, she belong to everybody That girl there, she belong to everybody  [Interlude: Anderson Paak] (Oh, no) Look here baby I hope you found whatever it is that you need But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round bare foot in these streets Look out  [Bridge: Bruno Mars] Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back) To the city, oh, you got me  [Chorus: Bruno Mars] Smokin' out the window Singin' "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?) (How could you do this, baby?) I thought that girl belonged to only me But I was wrong (I was wrong) 'Cause she belong to everybody, everybody (She belong) Yeah, she belong to everybody She belong to everybody Ooh

Music & lyrics & Video are all great! I can't wait to listen to other songs in the album!
This was both the greatest song and video I have ever seen.
Ooooooohhhhhhh sheeeeiiiiiitttttttttttt 🔥
I've followed Bruno Mars since he started over 10 years ago, I've always loved his music and what they created with Silk Sonic is excellent. But can we PLEASE say something about those lyrics and what his songs are saying? I see nobody talk about that. Like come on, are you that possessive that you expect "your" girl to stay because you bought her jewelry? And what about those so many girls surrounding you, in other songs, while you and your band are playing? Do you really need that kind of narratives to be valid?  The 70's vibes could be enough. You can do better than that!  - Please be respectful if you really need to answer this. -
Nice and smooth
This song is hilarious and such a vibe I love it looking forward to the rest of the album and keep up the slow releases
What a beautiful song 🤰🏽🤰🏽🤰🏽
Wonderful👍
Lindos
It’s giving
Andy just appearing in the frame out of nowhere is everything <3 I love this man.
And why is nobody talking about this ( because they hooked on Summer Walker (ladies seek therapy btw lmfao) )   But I can’t wait for this album tbh !!! Best collaboration
Fayiz I will love you always 🤍
Ima say it since nobody else is…. Bruno Mars look like he on that stuff🙊🙈🙉
This song should have ended with a clip of future and his iconic line "She belongs to the shkreets"
Another hit!
when Bruno hit that "Chuck E. Cheese" 👌👌👌
The amount of petty in Bruno’s head movements is UNMATCHED!
comedy is on point.  the best form of satire is sincere.
The pure definition of a mf rockstar !!!!!!!!!
Not chucky cheese
Damn...not give you back to the city 😂😂😂
Oh I like this one
I love it..😍
🤩🤩🤩
nice music
Yet another HIT!!!
Here before one billion views
I love this song like I'm literally obsessed!
Thank God for REAL MUSIC. I am 72 years old and LOVE 💘 YOUR MUSIC!
The Weeknd: She belongs to the world Silk sonic: She belongs to everybody  🥴😳💀
Eles sabem Oq estão fazendo ! E a perfeição é a meta !
Simply Classic old school funk, soul music there. Down to the wardrobe to the set backdrop goes back to the late 60s and 70s.
Geniuses.
Bruno Mars never, NEVER disappoints ❤️
fantastic❤️
I want to know how they were able to film this video without busting out laughing.  Anderson popping onto the screen not once but twice.
im sorry but somebody needs to make a parody of this song lol my life would be complete
GIVE US THE ALBUM ALREADY PLS
That was a funny video I like it
These guys have done it again !! I'm loving their music !!!
BRUNO MARS SUPREMACY! 💥
Bravo Bruno and co, it's all that is missing from today's guild   Love it  it's got a Motown vibe like even then wasn't smooth as this . 2  Thumbs up . Ps I'm a hard rock guy
Bruno Mars jumped the shark A LONG TIME AGO. It's hard to say who he's imitating this time...but one of the voices sounds like a direct MJ rip
yeah, they did it again. geniuses
Me trás uma sensação de está vendo o Michael Jackson, isso é muito bom!
Funk, soul, humor, charm, VIBES! Can it get any better?
I ducking love them
This song is so fire 🔥
Dayum!!!! Another winner from Bruno and Anderson!!!
This song gon get me thru organic chem exams mhm😩💕
Old school vibes ❤️
Now this is a music video!
Hello from Russia! Kindness, peace and love to you!
Se me eriza la piel. OMG!. Best Dúo in the world
How about Bruno cover “Reasons,” not that his own music isn’t just as incredible-
This may be the album of the century....fuck 🤯
WHEWWWWWWW!!!!! ❤️😩😩
I love it they’re perfect together. So smooth and sexy
Obsessed; can’t wait to see this live
Bruno looks like his dad right here
Love it
I am calling it! The album is going to sweep the Award Shows
OMGGG!!!! THATS SO GOOD
Send her back to the streets 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️😂😂
DIOS es muy bueno
Honestly, R&B artists might as well not drop next year. Silk Sonic already got that Grammy on lock.
this is krazy
PSA brought to you by Mar-bro...
this must be the Simp anthem......great song tho
Paak got that old school Bobby Womack look 😂😂
21st century Doo Wop.  I love it.  The dance movements remind me of Gladys Knight and the Pips, The Temptations, Little Anthony, heck, ALL of them.
Calling the woman the “B” word is not cool!!!
Love this song and you guys. God Bless.
Love love love this
Wow, one song better than the other! You are doing your own thing and i am loving it!
perfect :')
Just take my money already!! that album is so fucking SOLD
Never disappoint❤️
THIS B***** GOT ME..... I know some of y'all are going to be leaning hard on that part😂😂😂😂 S.S don't miss though😤😤
Is it just me or does anyone else see shades of Michael Jackson in Bruno Mars along with his moves and smooth voice. I can picture Michael singing this song!
every single they release, seems to be my favourite each time. excited for the album :)
They're too perfect together! They should just marry each other already!
This boutta be the greatest album of 20XX fr fr
wonderful mix of throwback genres to this lineup, the 50s/60s motown/soul, r&b old and new, 80s hip hop. really like what this arrangement opens up for one another - both vocally and instrumentally
*“Be honest who else is a few hours late”😂*
I'm not sure about how I find Anderson .Paak's singing and performance. There's something wrong
Another hit...sheesh
Finally a return to Real Soul Music
Silk Sonic is the embodiment of Motown Music! It's more alive and invigorating at this juncture than 1:44!
Kingg
Love It!!!! ❤️
Another One, Amazing, Can´t Wait For The Full Album , You Are awesome Guys , Silk Sonic Baby
el mejor  ese no falla bruno mars
Switch, DeBarge come to mind? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I love this!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Heavenly Father I pray that you keep the person reading this alive, safe, healthy, and financially blessed Amen
Tu e o filho do Michael Jackson mano todos sabem
ANDY’S COMING! Toys in Toy story: 1:44
The best duo/group/band/collab ever pls just make songs forever!!!
They the next Jackson 5.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Ha ha ha ha. This song is funny and sounds good!🎶😅👍
Don't like the bitch part love him but stop degrading us it's enough of that going on..If she was your woman she start out being a bitch. If so what's your label...
Been waiting for their album!! 😍😍😍
This is a masterpiece.
Facts
So F-in Loving this for a multitude of reasons!! Best collaborations in a looong time!!! My cheeks hurt watching this video! :) You Go Guys!
Your triflin a--s is my fav lyric.
Rebirth of R & B
The spiritual successor to “Calling All My Lovelies”, this duo is 3/3.. I have no doubts the album is gonna be fuego and an AOTY contender at that.
Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars are a dynamic duo!
arte y más arte
Thank y'all for bring back ole school R&B
Omg When Anderson dropped dead and then popped back up 💀
y'all gonna stop disrespecting Anderson Paak like he ain't got heat 🔥🔥🔥🔥 And stop putting these brothers against each other! They have reintroduced A genre of music that we don't experience too much in this era
💛💛💛
im getting michael jackson vibes
Such a fun song!
Gracias por trasladarme a años pasados y sentir esa nostalgia, un saludo desde Medellín
Apareçam brasileiros, eu sei que vocês estão aqui! 😁😁😁
Just give them Grammys already! Please and Thank you!
I enjoy the way that all of their songs feel like in-jokes, smooth in-jokes, that also have great in-jokes.
“THIS! BITCH!” 🤣🤣🤣🤣 absolutely love it!
Sublime !!
This is a Platinum hit
NUNCA ERRA!!!!!!! PERFEITOS COMO SEMPRE SOS

Yessssssssssss
This song and video is so good and hilarious at the same time!
Eres el mejor
Drop the album NOEWWWWWW!!💃🏻🎶
Please to all around the world please No Covers and kill the song!  To those who don’t know, this is Black Music %100!  Another important scientifically genetically speaking Bruno has Black dominant gene.  How?  He is of Puerto Rican descent which most have the Black genes.  The same with many Filipino.  Please people get knowledge of self and if you wish to argue research or become a scientist otherwise take it or let alone!
Ugh!!! Can’t get enough
I can listen to this song all day 🔥🔥🌚
New favorite song 🌞🔥 soooo fiiire 🔥 they the dynamic duo frfr
Bruno Mars bringing 2013 vibes love to see it. So nostalgic
Was born in the 70’s and this vibe brings back a ton of memories.
Mds,nunca erra🛐
When Anderson Paak said “Hercules” i instantly remember The Nutty Professor movie all of the sudden the dinner scene
The fact BRO THE FACT THEY ALL SING SO  ALIKE BROOO AND THE CURSES THE BEAT AND EVERYTHINGGGGGG
can’t stop listening omg
Yessss the notes♥️♥️
Who knew this is what I needed this evening......
Dang!! Please dont stop making music <3
Don’t let the awesome video distract you from the fact Anderson wanted to die so dramatically that he actually bled out on the carpet for 3.097 seconds
Lol tha Hook 😂 this bih
If this isn't on LP I'm not buying it...
So much talent! I’m a fan for life!
We need broken hearts bruno mars
This whole album gives me  an old time good memories vibe.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Banger as always from this two amazing artist!
This is the "she belongs to the streets" anthem we needed
Thanks Bruno and Anderson! Love the video if you guys want do anything else let me know!
Eu amo essa ritmo, o estilo e os cantores. Mas isso não me confortou hoje.
Please make sure this album is on Vinyl!!!

This song gave me a very important sign about a girl that i've dated just a few minutes ago. I don't think that it's just coincidence. Right now, i know something very important......  SHE BELONGS TO EVERYBODY.

It’s starting to feel gimmicky.  They know true soul/ r&b music is the shit. Made 1 true Gem- Leave the door open. And saw how it went- labels saw it. And now they are just throwing shit together. Of you listen to real Soul/ R&B, the point is Understood.
I love it. Just pure music. No special effects.
Bruno I’m begging you please do a collab with Ariana🙏🏽
The only song trending that aint hot garbage.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷  cadê os br 👀
LOVE IT!
All I can do is lol and smile watching this 😂❤️
The video is incredible. But I don't understand why all the guys have to smoke while performing. This is 2021 man!! You can do all the same things you're doing without smoking. Keep on doing that great music
cooool ! definitely reappearance of the brilliant america that I have still longed for. danke schoen for Silk Sonic.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇯🇵

YOOO!🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
Music and Swag🔥🔥🔥🔥
Shit hard tho 🎯🎯🎯🎯
Love it straight up old skool ❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE THIS SONG 😍❤️🥰
Más de 10 veces que la escucho 😔
I Recently wrote an academic paper on the stuff Bruno and Silk Sonic have been doing for the music industry.  The use of advanced chord progressions, organic instrumentation, and retro showmanship.  Perhaps the start of a new movement of artists that’ll choose an acoustic drum kit over 808s.
Bruno never disappoints me 🔥🔥 he needs way more recognition
perfeito and perfect
You guys are geniuses!
Literalmente no chão KKKKKKKKKKKKKKK eu amo esses caras véi
0:59 what the heck kind of dance is that?
They look like they had so much fun making this album and it's really nice to watch ☺️
bomb.
Anderson falling and coming up back from the ground out of nowhere is the highlight of this music video😂😂😂
these fellas bout to drop aoty
music is just really good, specially in a time where everything seems to be synthetic xP  just the lyrics bruh :3  hahha dont kill me, just saying !
Hello everyone!!! All the best !!!🥰🥰🥰🥰

He actually died 🤣🤣
Anderson - Smokin out the window ft. Bruno Mars
This just gave me 2021 version of " Gold digger"  and I love every minute of it!
Simplesmente BRUNO MARAVILHOSO e ANDERSON PAKOTINHO.Eles fazendo música eu automaticamente sorrio e começo a dançar😍😍🤸‍♀️
Great R and B always.
100% ART
Paak finally getting his shine
AOTY incoming!
Lmao....they are funny as hell! Made my day looking at this vid! Thanks
Yo, if my boyfriend hasn't seen this yet, we are watching it first thing when he gets home. lol This was way too good. XD
They said "This BITCH!!🤣🤣🤣
This reminds me of my mother driving us kids around Chicago in our old Chevy, Motown songs playing on our local AM station.  Windows wide open 'cause we didn't have A/C.  A wonderful warm breezy day in the summer.
The goal is not to drop the cigar out of their hand and that dude on the floor is not so dramatic lmao
THE BASSIST DID THE JOB WELL.
Paak😂😂😂
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH BOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
NO WHY THE FUCK DID THEY EVEN BOTHER WITH "SKATE" ??? THEY COULD'VE BEEN ON A ROLL IF THEY RELEASED THIS AS A SECOND SINGLE
Genius!  Love these boys. Wow. My best friend looked just like Bruno and was beat to death. I swear he comes back brilliant threw Bruno. He was also a singer and dancer and had a Karaoke buiss. He was older than Bruno. Anyways. Thx u. Cause of Bruno Al will never be dead. Amen.
MY FAVOURITE YET
🔥🔥🔥🔥

Wow 🔥🔥🔥
Hard 🔥 https://youtu.be/5sklM_BtcMg

21.11.6 lip J의 출근송 출근송으로 너무 좋은거 아니에요 ? 🧡 (아 근데.. 주말 오전 5시.. 츌근이라니...언니 건강 챙겨 🧡🥲)
WOW I AM OBSESSED!!!
I live some Bruno, but these songs with Silk Sonic are way too throw back and strange for my taste.  What is his deal lately. Then that fool falling on the floor and popping back up was ridiculous.  I was hopimg for a Bruno album to come out after not hearing from him. I was excited when it got announced but every song that drops is just odd.
those stomps after “Hercules” are infectious
Man I love bruno I wish I was talented like him
i didn’t know future wrote their songs
bruh anderson on the ground had me cracking up 😭😭
1,900 people gave this a thumbs down. Know absolutely NOTHING about good R&B!
They killed it, love this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Que buenísima canción 🥵🥵ya quiero ver coreografías
Lol not the fake death 💀 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why that fool sprawled out on the floor like that?! 😂 The lyrics and theatrics of it all, chile! How can you not enjoy this?! 😂😂😂
Orgasmic !!
Old heads saying new music is not good 🤡
"Now I gotta give you back to the city" translation: "she for the streets!"
One word on my mind.Awesome
Friends, JESUS is here to help you only if you were just to ask HIM. HE loves you and is waiting for you to call for HIS help. HE will help you. I bless you al in the name of JESUS  .I bless you all in the name of JESUS
Smooth ASF 💥💪🏾😎💪🏾💥
oh to be that cigarette on Bruno's hand
Dat shit was hard
Bruno is timeless such an amazing artist always with bangers
This song is so 🔥
カッコいい❤️
There is so many songs dropping rn
Another one!!
I'm in love with the sass
Now we need a "Anderson on the Floor" track 😂
🤣🤣😂😂🤣 I caaaant lol I love it
1 more week
❤Larry from Les Twins dancing put me up on 'Leave The Door Open' & now Marsai Martin IG post brought me to this song😭😂😂😂😂😂
New Edition swag!!!!
This is great 😂
You guys NEVER MISS!!!

Best album of 2021!🔥🔥
The music, the video, the swag, ooh the whole package is awesome!! 🥰
*Not me playing this on repeat to learn every lyric*. This is the best thing that’s happened in 2020-2021. I look forward to seeing the mass amount of awards their gonna win for an album.
Anderson Paak reminds me of Lenny Williams in Cos I Love You 😅 Full of emotions.
Wow lol how Anderson was just laying on the ground while Bruno was singing his lines ... Then instantly popped up for his lines was the funniest lines ever... Something you see from cartoons!!! 🤣 Damn good groovy music!! About damn time someone comes out with MUSIC instead of all this trap clap and gangsta crap!!!
There's no school like old school 🔥
This album really gonna be the greatest shit ever
Can't wait for their other songs to talk about the backyard, the roof, and maybe the bathroom with the house theme they got going on
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 keep 'em coming 👍🏾a lost art in music today.
I love this beat i seriosuly cant get enough!
Smoking  timeless music !!
Please put me out of my misery and release the album soon.
Genius
Love u guys...
💣💣💣💣💣💥

Congratulations to everyone who comes in every single seconds❤❤❤❤❤
🌜🤝🏻🌛
This that coke music
These lyrics are so funny to me
Damn?? Is he still on the floor??
Why i feel so smooth?😁
Anderson park is not a real singer! Bruno Mars do not need him… but I love the concept…
The cut to Anderson on the ground has me 💀
I cannot get enough of the old school vibe 💕 takes me back to my childhood days with my dad
Now this is good music lady and gentlemen
Bruh andy rly died mid-song and came back to life for the chorus 😂😂  now thats professionalism
I think I will start smoking

Lol this is savage .... a song how "she belongs to the streets"!!
And once again, Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars shows the world how to make great music and FUN too!  I haven't seen this kind of energy and potential in a band in ages.
Love yall together ❤
This is a blessing, thank you.
This is amazing
BRUNO MY AUNT LOVES U
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is talent 💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥good music #well done mr Mars
I love it! And Bruno....ooh ! ❤️
Love the old school R&B...yes!
Why Bruno looking like he smell like vodka lately?
Truly seeking the intelligence of today's man. The word "BITCH", is offensive to women point blank. Songs in this era are only sell outs for a buck. Like it if you will. But remember that a woman birth the Nations.
Sweet <3
70s vibes….
Sensacional 👍👏
Damn
I can’t stop watching this video!!! When Anderson falls out, then pops back in  😅😂🤣😭
This is THE BEST collab EVER and i just can't wait for the album
Good god the tongue in cheek of these songs are truely amazing what a fantastic feeling idea yes please groove daddys

Most lit killer combo I swear 👑
leave the door open tuvo exito hagamos otra igual xd
**Guess what.....NO AUTO TUNE**......Love This...
I know it wouldn't rhyme but I was hoping they were going to say "she belongs to the streets..." lol. But any who, this song is amazing.
Glamourising smoking is not cool. With great influence comes great responsibility.
WOW!Bruno this is awesome ..I love your music. I grew up in the '50s  so this music brings back the great music I grew up with. Right now I keep listening to " Leave the door open"! 💖
Silk Sonic at it again!
2:43
They gotta make a Christmas song
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh my gosh
1:34
PEAK SWAG
another song to put on repeat :D i've liked every song this group has made
I love this song
1:25
Seriously loving these old school vibes. Please keep making music together. Now this is what GOOD MUSIC IS!!🔥
a lot of you dm me claiming that bruno mars career with submittadly ended prior to his height. Listen to me and read this comment: bruno mars makes peaceful and engaging music, they only one hurting himself is him, he cares for the prior wardrobe? - I think not - "he doesn't try to be America's #1, he just wants to be hawaii's hang out boy"
Please put Bruno Mars's voice in a candle and just let me chill and listen......
This is so amazing on so many levels!
Finally!!  The album is almost here.
0:32 They still beefing? 😁😁
0:11
This refreshing Temptations vibe, man...
Not to be dramatic but this vibe is killing my brain.These 2 guys are amazing!
I want this album on vinyl
The cheesy 70's silhouette shot though...Most excellent.
Just amaziiiing
Keep this trending please
the basslines are on pointttt
Wao me encantan.. excelente duplaaa
I hope we can get this album on vinyl.  🤞
Sometimes you gotta know when to hold em.. and know when to fold em. This group needed to retire years ago.
I felt “FAINT” just from getting the first glance of them… studio, lights and all before they started moving and singing. This song is smooth, right, fire and funny. I truly couldn’t go to sleep last night because I was beyond too hyped. Had to call off today because I couldn’t function today! 😂🤣🤣😂😂🥲😵‍💫🤣…I’ve NEVER, EVER LOVED AN ARTIST, Musician, group, band as much as I absolutely adore BRUNO. Adding ANDERSON In my ENTIRE LIFE…Ummmmm too much goodness in one place!!!! CONGRATS to all of them🥂💦💧🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣💨💨
Smooth... Damn!
they've done it again! Good job
Bruno mars and weekend - different vibe
Smooth.....talent..good-lookin'.....
Yall got another one just like this
💛💛💛
I'm just tryna figure out if they're actually smoking lol
Veía full recomendacion en fb mucha presion me hizo que viniera hasta aca y no me arrepiento esta padrisima <3
I want to know how many Newports it took to make this video.
5 listens later and I like it more then leave the door open and skate.
❤❤❤❤❤megsni https://youtu.be/xwAnK_Jg8qQ
I swear the beat reminds me of MJ's never can say goodbye! 🎵🎶🔥🔥🔥
They can not be stopped,  their comedians too!!!!
The dynamic duo does it again!! Reminded me of New Edition! Umm, Bruno and Anderson please right something for them!
This song is such a JAM but at same time hilarious like this band is so good but also reminds me of SNL parody
So cold
Love
The moves the beat the lyrics these guys have got the game in a choke hold.
This album cannot possible live up to the hype….can it!?
The best💕💕
Another one!!!!
After the door this time the window. Next time it will be what?
This a classic 🔥
WOOUUUUUUHHHHHH
Love it!!!!!
I love the nuances this is Brilliant
LIKE SI LLEGASTES A ESTE COMENTARIO QUE DIOS TE BENDIGA Y TENGAS TODO 🙏
The Temptations would be proud of the choreography, but why the cigarettes?
So unexpected yet expected!  You leave me wanted more always!
I'm laughing to this song, is this normal?
This is real music👏
I liked this song after the first 10 seconds!
Simply put...... WWOW.A "real" song put in R&B form that is 🔥. This is the best song this year frfr
The dance choreography makes this top tier
Yesssssss more more we need more!!!! Love it absolutely love it.!!!!!
There voices just go so well together, 10/10 performance 🔥
Wow!! Really dope song. Had to pause the video when it panned to Anderson Paak sprawled out on the floor. Lololol. Definitely better than Skate and right up there, maybe even with Leave the Door Open in my opinion. Release the album!

Lindo demais parabéns

The humor in this is next level. When Paak ends up flat on the floor, I busted out laughing.
😜👍😈😂
they're about to take all my money with tickets and merch omg
Their energy is EVERYTHING.... The way he popped his head out "this B" I screamed 😂
I'm from Angola, and I spent all my day listening this great song, thank you Silk Sonik 😭❤️ I have a close experience with this kind of women 😫😭 Keep givin' us good songs like this
Great song and a great Video! Sounds "old style" but exactly that is what we need today!
Bruno Is so smooth with it 🔥🔥
Visível a inspiração nas músicas de Michael Jackson... Não dá pra deixar de notar
Too much talent, I can't take it!!! The video deserves more views
Such good vibes 😎 😻
I don't feel this one, but that's alright   💃
Now thats a beautiful Marlboro commercial. 🚬 🚬 💕 💕
“THIS BITCH GOT ME… “  🤣🤣🤣
Omfg this is amazing! I love when songs aren't meant to be serious. Life is way to serious at the moment and they just make it so much better! Thank you so much for this! I love their like 70's feel and that they're making real music with real instruments, it's quite refreshing!
Can't wait for this album ❤👑
Both of them have old souls and if "He been here before" was a theme them two would be it..
Te amo x siempre 👑
Who are the men singing like this in the mainstream? Complex harmonies, and difficult advanced challenging vocal performances. It’s nice to hear because sometimes it feels like singers these days are afraid to…SING. Almost like they’re being specifically told by labels NOT to make vocally challenging songs and to make simpler tunes that the public can easily sing along to. Half the singers on the charts are too busy trying to market themselves as singer/rapper hybrids and rarely show off the full potential of their voices. The era of ‘the vocalist’ needs to make a comeback in my opinion. I feel like somewhere along the line it became ‘uncool’  to have tremendously good singers topping the charts who can blow the roof with their vocal skills, but I’m sure between Silk Sonic’s new Album and Adele’s 30 album , we will be treated to stupendous vocals this winter ❄️
Mannnn! This song reminds you  about the good ole club days when you see people tipping on their husband/wife
how do they do it?! how do they pure 100% fore every time?!
I loved this song right from the intro, I'm in love with this one too guys and I can't wait to hear the whole album, this one's another winner, I love you guys together, each one compliments the other ❤👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
TODOS TE AMAMOS BRUNO. <3
Beautiful song
Amazing
I want this album NOW!!!
The music video itself is kinda meh 😕...the song itself is just terrible lyrics and all 👎👎. Come on now Bruno you can do better than this.
DICE MI MEJOR AMIGO, QUE TAMBIÉN TE AMA. :)
These guys gonna fuck around and take home the Grammy award lol @1:44
Is fucking insane…
TE AMO BRUNO MARS, POR TI LE ECHO GANAS A LA VIDA. <3
These guys are about to make history, well they making history already... 👏👏🙌🙌
Love loveeeeee💜💜💜💜💜
Anderson. Wes Anderson. French Dispatch. Music for your eyes

Who else came straight here after watching Marsai Martin on Instagram jamming to this?
This is fireeee.
1:42 You sure you are not dramatic???? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i love the intro with the drums
Anderson dying and laying on the ground is hilarious and it's even funnier when he pops back up into frame. XD

LOVE IT!!🥰💖
Not Anderson flat on the floor and popping back up when it’s his turn! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this song is such a vibe !

LOVE THISSSSS!
Only 8 songs. That's kind of weak
I can hear n see a lot of dope boys riding round pullin up to tha trap with this blasting
Lol so troll so dramatic, this song is smoking, oh by the way smoking degen
Bruno Mars is a lyrical genius. this hits the spot
HITS MACHINE
Lmao! Paak just layin there dead.
Nao existe musica ruim com esses dois
delicioso :)
I feel that what was great about "leave the door open" when it first came out was that they found a way to sound and look fresh even when obviously still inspired on that "retro" music and look vibe, but now... Idk... its becoming more of a parody to me. I love both of them, hope they re find that path. ❤
Another one!
gay
Yes bring that sound back like it never left.
AMEI
Esto es una joyita papá. This is a little gem dad
Watched it at least 10 times before I could comment. How in the hell did you manage to combine wit, sarcasm, humour, musical artistry, sexiness and poignancy in one video and song? I was smiling all the way through, every, single, time. Love it. Love everything about it. Sssssssssmoking out the window!
Tgis is the most potent power duo ive ever seen, god damn
The break up song
Damn Make my day 💙🥱😊😘
Yo this whole video had me rolling with the lyrics and i think it pissed my baby mama off after the third play

Its Anderson playling dead for me lmao
Another hit guys Love it
RAAAAAAA
Fantastic song!  Andy gets funnier every time I watch it.
Love, Love, Love!
Yeah the oldheads are going to love this.
I think Bruno Mars is 1000 times better as a solo artist! I hope that someday he'll bring out his own album again!
Increíble
The first moment this album hits my ear drums will be the moment I finally combust spontaneously. I simply hope that all my affairs are in order before the 12th cause I knew this was coming and I’m still not fuckin ready. 😖😫🙌🏽💕🔥
the vibessssssss
this made my day! thank you thank you thank you!! ❤❤❤❤
Let's face it,..   It's no "ama leave this door open" 😉let bruno throw his grenades alone🌎👌🌊💔😄, There's a big difference between a D-12 drop & an Eminem drop! Jus' saying #UGfan🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬 😊
Simplesmente amei ❤
Is he supposed to look like Sammy Davis Jr. cause the similarity is striking.
I have HOLLERED!!! The lyrics are killing me but the beat is the shit!!! Looka here fine buddy on those drums tho! *swoons*
YEEEESSSS ANOTHER ROCKET...... BRUNO U ARE FANTASTIC.....IT IS SO STICKY ,,,,,,BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!
Felicidades!! lograste tu objetivo  encontrar un comentario en español XD
I want a remix version with the one and only future. Future vibin' to the melody would be 🔥🔥 "she belongs to the streets"

This song is very reminiscent of  "Kanye West & Andre 3000 - Everybody " - has the same aesthetics
Straight banger!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No but the lyrics are SO funny

Todos sus videos son un mil
I'm 56 years old, been a Bootsy Collins fan since birth!  When Bruno & Pak told us that The Legend Bootzilla was behind this, I WAS HOOKED!!!
Eu acho extremamente INCRÍVEL como a voz deles combinam tanto. <33
They don’t miss

I AM OBSESSED
It would be cool to see Silk Sonic sing a ... HALLOWEEN SONG
I'm really hoping that this Silk Sonic project releases as a visual album. It would be so perfect.  Edit: This is the most confusing thread I've seen in a minute.
When the word B...tch is called respectfully in  the 21st Century. What a song!!!!! So refreshing.
كاني في الثمانينات

Omg I love these r&b vibes 😍
Fun Fact: Bruno Mars is Hawaiian
It's make me think of the Jacksons.
This video reminds  the early 90s
The best singers👏
Jesus! These guys could cuss me out in a song and I would still be listening to it 24/7.
If you think that music deserves your attention, then it is.
Bruno Mars is the ONLY artist bringing out REAL music in 2021 Melody,Lyrics,Choreography, Style, REAL INSTRUMENTS.. BRINGING OLD SCHOOL BACK TO LIFE!!!!
Gracias

Really love how much humor you put into this performance, it was truly enjoyable 🤩
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
This is what my Soul needs and want. Waiting for that Album to drop is like a kid in a candy store. Real music is hard to come buy
I'm bout to go get me a pack of Newports and I quit smoking many years ago.  Then imma stop and pick up a fifth of Jeffers Creek and jam this ALL WEEKEND LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For pop music, this is what pop music should revisit. Lyrically it’s very cheesy though. Cringeworthy at times..
Wow~ great！👏👏👏👏👏👏
Bro, this album will not have a bad song at all 100% faith the only part i hate is when the song ended :(
Menuda puta vacilada !! Me encanta!! ❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ete loco be lit compartiendo su zanahoria   Y ahora se queja de que ella es de todos fkvkdlfkfkkdkf  ES BROMA, ES BROMA  SAESQUE BRUNO TU ME VOTAS A LA CALLE Y I THANK YOU COMOSETEOCURRE
OMG, outstanding! Drama meets Comedy meets Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak as Silk Sonic… If you don’t know you better ask somebody. Back to Back Hits, that’s what’s up!

Cool, old school story telling! I cracked up the whole time. Loved it.🔥🔥🔥
This album is gonna be just AMAZING🔥
primero antes del millon
They’re so smooth. I’m so glad they’re bringing this whole era and vibe back. Bruno and Anderson are so goofy and this video showed their personality. Freaking loved it😩
Ya'll Really Don't Miss! Refreshing to see Grown Ass Men make music again.
That Bruno Mars can really sing... He should really consider a solo career 😂
bro drop the album
wake up in the sky setting?
Another banger from Bruno never misses
Silk Sonic can't miss It's like the hoop is 20 ft wide! No cap!! 🏀🏀🏀
Anderson had me cracking up when he died on that floor then popped back up😂😂😂😂
Bruno and Anderson are my favorite couple <3
Bruno is in his ESSENCE! We still see ya Bruno!!  ❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
The camera cutting to dead Paak at 1:40 was absolute jokes LMFAO
I love this song so entertaining had me tickled 😂
I can't get ENOUGH ❤
I love this. There bring old school back. I can vibe to this in my car yes!
This album gonna get so many people pregnant

This is a great!!!
Nuevamente Bruno Mars , Anderson ,Paak. Silk Sonic SORPRENDIENDO !!!! QUE GRAN TEMA !!!! 🤩 Los amo chicos !!! Saludos desde Perú !!!🇵🇪
THE MESSAGE OF THIS SONG: "She Belongs to the streets"
I f*ing LOVE Anderson.Paak 🤣🤣!! Both these guys (and everyone involved in Silk Sonic) are so unbelievably talented & I love the humor they've woven into each song. They love what they do, have fun doing it & want us all to have fun listening. Mission accomplished!!
These guys have so much Swagger and make Great music. 😊⭐👍
Such good vibes .... puts me in a smooth mood
When I saw Anderson on the floor face down I almost died too!!!!
Love it
Listening to this once is a crime😭
es que no puede fallar, no puede
UGHHH OBSESSED
I am sure we're living in the 70's but in a modern way. This Martian is truly gifted.
♥️♥️♥️♥️🤩🤩🤩🤩🤗🤗🤗🤗
yes sir  love it 🇫🇯
This is way more Paak. Loooove it.
Good song but sounds n looks like a Saturday night song
I wonder how much the room smelled filming this 🤔😂
Magia, straordinari
This is a mood!!! 🍷🔥
Daym anderson died like yamcha real quick
Man, I can't wait til this album drop!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍
bruno's moves go hard
I remember, how my dad usually smoked in the car, back in the 70ties, but i was tried to catch fresh air out of window. Good memories😄
So damn dope and talent musicians in the world 🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍
WOW!!!
THOSE CIGARETTES ARE FAMOUS NOW hahahahahahaha
Bruno 😍
Silk sonic 2021 version of the stylistics.  Keep up that silky sound
better than i thought !
Y’all are funny! I’m sure this will be the newest talk of the family or town…. 🙊🙉🙈🐒💃🏽💋
This song is on my top three favorite songs by Bruno Mars. This one is number 2✨🔥🔥
Je fais actuellement parti des premiers francophones à écouter cette musique, nous sommes le 5 novembre 2021, il y'a 2.4 millions de vues. Objectif le milliard pour cette pépite 🚀🚀🚀
หวัดดีครับ
This is the most smoothest way I’ve ever heard anyone say that a girl belonged to the streets!!!
I am disappointed with Bruno Mars, what a retro trash concept "smoking". What a bad example.
I love this collaboration again.... Best song ever, Thank you Bruno and Anderson, I love you guys
👏👏👏👏
Iconic again
WoW the BEST 😍😍😍
it's a vibe
I love that this has had 2.5 million views in 16 hours. This  is good on so many levels - effortlessly beautiful soul music with great soul voices, and blinding harmonies, a great look and clever dance routine AND they are not precious and vain - along with all that musical genius they are giving us slapstick comedy. So cheeky, and so good. Bruno just keeps getting better and has a big enough heart to bring huge talent with him, and collaborate on making fantastic new music . . .
no vapes?
They killing it
Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel!
Godddd😭❤❤❤
This is golden, 😂😂😂🔥🔥
The whole video is very comical I was laughing my ass off when Anderson paak fell out
*this was pretty darn cool.* 😎
💯
That's AWESOME'...
sucks
This music video is everything🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️
Bruno looks different every time I see him but the song is great as usual
THIS BITCH GOT ME playing this song on repeat.
This gave me chills!!!
That's not how you smoke though!
#SILK SONIC WORLD TOUR

Definitely the best artists this year. Perfect, wow. Respect! Thank You for this.
When Anderson hits that first ‘bitch’  it murdered me 🤣
All I knw is I can’t wait for the album to drop
Anderson.Paak + Bruno Mars = Simply perfect ❤.
70s is back 👌
1:16 - 1:23
Many smarts  got what they deserve. SO.. Complain out of place. Anyway.. Good melody!.
Can’t wait to go to a club and play DEAD whilst they play this song 😁😁😁
"This Bitch!" 😂😂😂😂 I lost it! 🤣🤣🤣
highest level of modern music creativity today (ever?!?) DOPE arrangements & harmonic melodies that were ol skool but remade new I would pay a couple hundred per seat to see this tour The Free Nationals (Open) Andy & The Free National (Set 2) Bruno Mars (Set 3) Silk Sonic (Close)
Why this give me church vibezzz  PRAISE THE LORD 🤣🤷🏽
RUN THAT BACK!!!
At this point Bruno should just join the band full-time.    Everything they do together is straight fire.
The harmony and key changes are sultry and drama galore on the performance
❤️❤️❤️
This is genius 😍
November 12th, pls come soon.
Tantas pessoas morrendo de câncer,  e um clipe de apologia ao fumo, glamurizando esse vício quê abre porta para outras demais drogas.
This formula works like most of their songs. They attract all generations!!!  Love it!!!💜💜💜
the most unimaginable duo but which go so well together still a great song to play well guys 😉
Here before 3M pass

This is amazing. I'm dying laughing at this song and video. I'm ready for this album.
Glad to see someone is bringing back Motown.  I grew up in 60's and 70's.  We got a hit per week.  Today nothing.  This tune is cool.

Yes lord
I would fucking love a song in this album with post malone!!!!
"Not to be dramatic..." and he hits the floor and just lays there like a slug. I can't. I laughed so hard, I scared my dog.
Payback is a Dog 🐕 Smokin Out Window.  Brother man is pissed off.  Hilarious.  Better than SNL  Smooth 70’s Moves but  This ain’t no Thom Bell Tune here for sure  Love the genre mashup.  what will they think of next?
Copied Walk It Like I talk It video
Garota!!!! Tremenda letra

Me if I was a backup in the MV: So we just gonna ignore Paak on the ground and keep singing
They not missing a beat and all the music is 🔥. I’m ready for the full album so I can go by 73 Deville and drive around while smoking out the window.
Sensacional 👏👏👏
Smoking is bad for you. It can cause cancer. So you shouldn't smoke. FYI
Silk Sonic 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They are so gooooood! I can't ahdjajf
These people are creating magic every time they release a new song 😍
best duo of the new decade
Woooouu 💕 ecuador presente
It's the " I hope you find whatever you need but I also hope your trifling ass walking around barefoot in these streets " 🤣🤣🤣

Another great song 👌.
Smoking is bad. You shouldn't promote this ugly behavior ( Smoking cigarettes ) I like the whole thing in this video except holding cigarette on hand!!
Hit Makers.
I love Bruno Mars
Smoking out the window🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn! They put my into a situation to spend 45K $, just to get the album already 😂
These two brothers are dynamite together as a group.  What we did not get from Michael and Prince. Bruno and Anderson made up for it!
Legendary.
Love them so much!!!
yeah i’ve found my new favourite song
Saw and heard the song on Twitter had to listen to the entire song 🎧😩🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anyone that doesn't like this song is out of their mind!! This is the smoothest bitch diss in history !!!
Another Creative Banger!! Keep them hits coming... Favorite group this year
Silk Sonic with Bruno Mars, the group you dont wanna ever break apart
Top 5 Cosas Malas de las MUJERES RUSAS... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24

Hot 🔥🔥🔥Damnnn🔥🔥🔥💯❤️
😍
choreography was great, song is catchy. I like!
I love the vibe! This album has awards all over it. It will definitely break records. These men are so talented and the vocals is masterful.  While watching it I danced, laughed and sang because its already  classic!
bruno mars giving me sammy davis jr vibes with that outfit
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Bruno and Anderson thinks this is a game?!?!? Bring back the Truth Cigarette commercials....
Bro this video is funny
This is R&B!
Why not solo
Was it necessary to glamorize smoking? Young kids love Bruno and now he and his band are making it look cool to smoke. Of all the zillions of things you can sing about, you had to sing about something that causes cancer?? Really disappointed in Bruno!! DO BETTER!
god i love them so much
Bravo de France......
Oh no  Wawo
I hope this album wins album of the year next year at the Grammys
omfg
Reminds me of 70 motown. Bruno mars looks like a young healthy sammy davis junior
🔥🔥🔥👌🏻
Omg
This is the classiest “she belongs to the streets” song I’ve heard in this era
Fellas out here… Looks like y’all got a new anthem! This b*tch got me…. Smoking out the window!🔥
Smoking kills
I love Bruno Mars songs I had to hear this song
He's really delving deep into a style of music.
##THE MUSIC IS THE SONG!!!REMIX
J’AIME BCP TROP PTNNNNNN
“not to be dramatic” *falls to the ground and lays face down for 30 seconds with a cigarette in hand*  I LOVE HIM😂😭😭
This song makes me wanna buy a pack of cigarettes while jamming to this and think about life and i dont even smoke 😶😩
This music is what we needed pre and post pandemic.  Im healed.
I was not ready Oh my god
Men underestimate how much women enjoying watching you dance . I look forward to  the choreography and movement in Silk Sonic videos
Because wow!
Dope Ass Video 💯🔥🔥🔥

Oldschool staff with the new quality, so simple and so great...
It could be Better Without cigarettes
Maravilloso!! Capisimos ! Los amo. ✨🙌❤️🤩 Exitos!!
Love u Bruno💕💕💕
Nice, but I hate that this video sends the message of cigarette smoking...It killed my mother and many, many others in my family.  The Black community and people of color already battle far too many addictions.  But other than that, nice performance.
O... M... ... ... G.
Perfeitos demais ♥️
she belongs to the skreets
Splendid
I had 1.25x speed on accidentally and wondered why this song kinda sucks compared to the others lmao. But no, these songs still slap
Show 👏👏👏👏👏
Beautiful music, the best I have heard in this month …
no puedo parar de escuchar este rolón
Hey guys, you're saving the music in this era of mediocrity! Love that creative harmony changes. They bring color and originality to your songs.
This is the best thing that could happen to music from this era tho
He'll take her trifling azz back for that Hercules experience!
This song is not slept on. But they just scared cause thats what theyve been doing.
<3
We’re witnessing something special here x
Damn
Hahaha, this proves you can make anything sound good if you sound great.
Is it me or does Anderson Paak look and sing like Bobby Womack?
This is great music.  ❤️ I think the standards are so low now that everybody is craving great music.  That means instruments, good vocals, harmonies….
Woooooowwwwww
Wish Bruno sang the whole thing.  We need to clear up the lyrics, guys.  Don’t stoop like the rappers and hip hoppers. Make the 70s groups proud of you.  Keep it classy.
bro this is unique
Os melhores!!
“GOLD-DIGGER SONG”🏆💍💎💵💸💰💴💷💶💳 🥺💦
Who wants to listen to Modern Crap Music when we have "BRUNO & ANDERSON ?"
Another hit
finally😭❤️
Oh lord!! when do the tickets go on sell !
That ain’t a cigarette, it’s 🍁
The cigarettes as a prop, I'm feeling it! Don't smoke kids.
Bruno Mars being a singer of 80's it's dope, too hype
Sounds Amazing >:D
OOOOooooh that intro was smoother than peanut butter! You all are gonna have all the generations blasting this album for the next year! 🙌✨  I see some awards in the future 👏
I'm literally crying because the song is over
Good God! I like that!
I need more Silk Sonic
😂 Love it!!!
SMOKING KILLS YOU WHYYYY
LINDOOOOO
When Anderson & Bruno hit that *"THIS. BITCH."* _I felt that shit._
https://youtu.be/wDBd2iBjEro  He who listen before they speak will become more knowledgeable in the end
Another One in Dj Khalid's voice🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The playing dead moment was giggle worthy, but the line about hoping her "trifling ass is out walking barefoot on the streets" is what really got me to laugh.  Get the hell on Felicia!
Bro I died when it cut to .Paak on the floor dead.
OS caras são top demais slc👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Best band at the moment ❤🙌
she belongs to everybody
🔥
Bad kids running around my crib like Chuckie cheese! Brilliant!
Anderson had me dying laughing....but November 12th need to hurry up
1:44 Idk how Bruno manage to keep his composure with Anderson sprawled out on the floor like that because I would’ve been dying laughing. 😭
Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥    If Michael Jackson and Prince would have collaborated.
I don't like them using the word bitch. Nooooo
😂 This Bihh😂
I'm in loveeeeeee!!!! #SilkSonic
Silk Sonic puts the biggest smile on my face. I love this. 🤎
Twice's new album "Formula of Love" also releasing on 12th november(pre-order now) with the new title track "Scientist"🤩  Spread this!!🙏
I wonder how hard it was for Bruno Mars not to laugh at Anderson .Paak laying on the floor like that... NGL I laugh and kept on dancing LOL
I am dying!!!!
Let's go!
They went from leaving the door open to smoking out the window!! What happened??😂😂😂😂
1:45 XD
Bruno - This music  Is your Future , Please Don't go back to Hip/Hop - This is the best music produced in the 2020's - No other Act comes close to you and Anderson - Stay RETRO and you will Earn MILLIONS. Love Ya
I love how it makes you groove to every tune and the giggles just flows. Flawless video and tunes
https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCi8YsoFOnLgUasnIiC7sh1RHWeiVNGKW
The part at 1:16 goes SO HARD
I dont like
...those brown velvet suits tho.....
That drummer in the back, is that Eric Henandez, Bruno Mars' older brother? I know he's been drumming for him since nearly the beginning. Just never saw him in a music video until now.
Not to be dramatic but this jam is dead gorgeous to the ears and eyez 1:33 😅  !!!!
This joint is a classic 🔥 ALREADY
Silk Sonic is killin it!! I love this song, smooth and that classic humor lol. This album is gonna be FIRE!
Song is smooth AF!!! 😍 the harmonies and beat is everything
Good song keep singing them makes  you want to dance
Who in the blue hell is writing these songs?!!!....whoever they are...keep them on!!!!
Amooo
This is the best song i listened from you guys, Jesus Christ!!
👏👏👏♬♬♬🖒
This made my day!! 🥰🥰🥰 a masterpiece
as usual these guys killed it!  Great song. :)
This came out an hour ago, already 14,000 comments lol
Just when you thought there was no Topping LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN... These Muthafuckin Geniuses go and drop this Heat Rock on you Jive Turkeys!!!...  I can dig it  🔥🔥🔥
This song is Neo-soul GOLD!!        LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!!!
I don't think this one is as good as Leave the Door Open or Skate, but I really really love the return of purely acoustic music to the pop culture scene. We need more like this. Get hyped for the album!!
They said Hercules Hercules Hercules but made it smooth.😅 shout out to Eddie Murphy
Amazing. Album is going to make history! Also hilarious video
MAN IM DANCING HERE, IM DANCING HERE. BITCHH LOOK ME DANCING
literally so hype for this album
I'M SO HAPPY YALL DOIN THIS!!! The theatrics, the energy, every musician and singer is just on freaking point! Looking forward to the future music to come <3

Why you doin' this to me, girl? Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die  [Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars] This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrist And here I am all alone (All alone) I'm so cold, I'm so cold You got me out here  [Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson Paak] Smokin' out the window (Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo) Singin' "How could she do this to me?"

1:20 is honestly ADDICTIVE!! Hercules 😭😭😭👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I genuinely gave this a standing ovation in my own room👏🏾
I BUST out laughing when I saw Anderson on the floor🤣🤣
Wow! Such a wonderful Harmony ❤️. You nailed it again guys!
I freaking love it 😂😂😂🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥
The way they do when they say "she belongs to everybody" 😂
A mil❤
makes me think of Roses by Outkast in that smooth hatred energy
Bruno mars forever, ever, ever the best 😭💗
Wonderful choreography and just a great sound.  Well done!  I laughed my behind off when Anderson delivered his lines of the music and then was shown laying dead on the stage.  That was funny, but when he popped up from the bottom of the screen on his next accompaniment with Bruno made it hilarious.
I think it's fate that I'm watching this video right as I'm about to spark a blunt😂

LOVE THIS SONG YOU GUYS LOOKING SO SWEET AND SEXY !!!!!❤❤❤🎤🎤🎤💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
And another one!!!
Another classic🌟🕺🏽🕺🏽
IM SCREAMING
This is my 4th time replaying the song 🤣 it’s so good!!!!!
Wish they could have used a different word than " b*&*h " . Took away some of the glamour of the song.  Such a derogatory word for woman .Other than that it is an okay song. I rate SKATE and LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN much better. Also I want to hear more background instruments especially in the intro.  But the voices are strong and powerful and the choreography is on point.
Love💘 his music 🎶 I grew ❤ up on Oldies But Goodies. So I love his 👋 style 😍
Bruno y Anderson paak juntos son de otra dimensión, con el flow hasta el cielo
Yes!!!
This song has a very importing message form men that have freeloading women.
nashe
Exquisites
YES!
1940 🤦‍♂️
Geez, my fake 70’s/80’s memories kicking again.
💥💥💥💥
Ive heard 3 songs so far and it might be album of the year.
Bootsy 🥰🥰🥰 Anderson🥰🥰🥰Bruno
Eu amo!!! 🇧🇷🧡
I thought this was going to be another love song. But it's a perfect anthem for men trying of freeloading women.
"dis b____ for the streets" but with class
Música boa é assim… atemporal!!!!! Fica na eternidade.
I cant wait for the concert!!
Never Can Say Goodbye vibes.
The New king of pop 😻😻😻😻
Deus nunca disse que a jornada seria fácil, mas ele disse que a chegada Valeria a pena. Sucesso pra geral que leu esse comentário🙏🏼🥳       Tenho um canal quem poder da uma força lá  Edit:não estou mendigando, vc não é obrigado a ajudar
This song is it!  The lyrics are truth and Anderson lying on the floor had me HOLLERING!  Love it! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruno Mars is hot
"This bitch" hit different when Anderson and Bruno sing it lmbo. Def another winner for Silk Sonic. Grammy's don't act up next year. You already know what it is!
Bruno Mars sending chicks back to the streets
#💙
https://youtu.be/B1xeYdkI0kY bruno inspires everything
Ace! The groove, melody, harmony and lyrical content is all on point 👌 🙌 👏 💯. These guys are truly setting the bar extremely high.
These fools are so corny. I love it!
Does no one wanna talk about the conviction in Anderson .Paak’s voice when he said “This B*tch”?
This is the smooth updated version of Bruno's "Natalie". I just ♥♥ Silk Sonic.  I'm big on old school music.  Bruno & Andy's voices and styles compliment each other so well.
This is alright! Real music! Y'all better sang! Thank you.
All the reaction pages to songs are like yessss more  Silk sonic on top though
The way Silk Sonic has tapped into my exact favourite type of music is crazy
1:43 perfect moment on the floor
it's amazing !!! 😭😭
😂😭this hot tho  it yall to funny 😂
BRUHHHH IM IN LOOOOVE
❤❤❤❤
So dope
Another One!
Glad they're bringing back the 70s soul/funk back!
YEAH BRUNO SHE BELONGS TO DA STREET
So know, i just wanna smoke at the window
perfeitos
the bass and the drums is the funkiest smooth shit ever
These dudes are amazing musicians! They get it! Real smooth soulful sound, tight harmonies and they are not afraid to try something different. This is also seen in the addition humor done just right. Silk Sonic is what R&B should sound like. They are already one of the best duos ever. I look forward to many more great music from them.
Lord help me. Now I want my husband in a velvet suit 🙄
Adorei á música, só acho que esses cigarros estragaram o clip
this one is my favorite!!!
This guy have talent MUCH TALENT!
It's crazy how you hear that Bruno and Paak are making music and you think to yourself that this is definitely going to be fire.  The song drops you press play and it's even more fire than you could have imagined.  It might be impossible for Silk Sonic to disappoint.
"I don't want to do anything dramatic" and then goes on to the do the most dramatic shit I have ever seen!!! lol I am going to laugh a whole week on this one, all while seeking for the perfect time to do this in real life....lol
Yal get me whining all over the flooooooorrrr!!!!
not to overdramatise but this remind me of what musics should sound like...
COOL!
iconic
I love the 70's vibe on their songs
Damn, we aint ready yet!
Le Swooooon🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
When the camera showed Anderson on the floor I was so weak
I love this song!¡
Estoy enamorada de esta canción
Treasure vibes
Don't think I've ever been as excited for an album release but Silk Sonic has changed that😍
Cuando llegará el día en el que me toque ver a Bruno en vivo 🤩

Las notas altas de Bruno es lo único que pido.
See what's possible whenever everyone appreciates the talents of others.  This collaboration is magical.
This song is a whole mood.
I just know this album will be fire every song has been a bop.  Each song has a similar sound and vibe.  Now we just need the concert so I can finally see my boy Bruno live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdo7BhCBOq8
Borrows a bit from the first song but a nice cut.  The album should be fire.
Excellence.
Amo el estilo que se cargan
Estoy orgullosa de ustedes, de todo lo que están logrando y van a lograr, estoy orgullosa de ser su fan y de haber acompañado a Bruno en todas sus etapas y ahora en esta nueva etapa con Anderson paak a quien sinceramente antes no conocía pero estoy muy orgullosa de lo que los dos están haciendo juntos

SHE BELONGS TO THE STREETS: THE MUSICAL
These dudes are outrageous. They are singlehandedly bringing back the art of song writing. Clever lyrics, great harmonies and the tightness of the band. I might invest in a vinyl copy when the album drops.  I've already listened to this song 6 or 7 times and watched a couple of reaction videos.
This is how you dragging the vibe from start to end. Superb work Boys.
Love how they keep coming super Retro. Bring back classic groovy tunes 🕺🏻
Good to see Epanda back on the drums 🔥

OMG!!! MY SKYYYYN 🤩🤩
La mitad de las reproducciones son mías, perdón pero la canción se volvió mi favorita <3 <3 <3
Bruno my religion 🛐
I remember dancing to this song in prom back in 1983. I was with the girl I liked, Margaret. It was so funny when the song came on. The radio station changed "bitch" to girl and it wasn't cool. During the prom. My buddy, Chris snuck the uncensored vinyl in and gave it to the DJ. You should have seen him with his big glasses and old bell-bottoms😂. We were dancing to John Travolta and Olivia Newton then, this song came on. It was the funniest slow dance ever. "This bitch"😂.  I just played it to my wife, Margaret now. she became teary eyed. Silk Sonic was the best back then. Thank you so much for the upload
Amazing song,❤ first music video without naked or half naked women that is lit 🔥 🔥  🔥
Another classic sons in the making ,this album is Lit 🔥🔥🔥
Michael Jackson's son right here
"This bitch"  Comical
This looks like an old cigarette commercial…smooooooth,
Love it
Good. Would have been gooder if only they had a sax/horn section.
El líder de RD me gusto el tema muy especial lo amó sigan asi chicos

Smokin out the window, quality music in my ears.

Bruh!

This song is the polar opposite of "Leave the Door Open. This one is more like "Shut the Damn Door.
Do you think i have the potential to be an artist?
this song is such a vibe😩https://youtu.be/MDrqrMzq8HA
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!
y'all are too funny X)
When Anderson sleep on the floor, Bruno “I don’t care.”😂😂😂
Yet another fuckin awesome song from Bruno and Silk Sonic 😍. Really in love with his songs.
🔥 https://youtu.be/X2xzeZ4RyFg
My best song of this year frm Tanzania 🇹🇿

Wow! Sounds like a motown vibes music, dope! Tsk!
Love all the music. Would’ve vibed if it was like this Chick got me. The this bitch is like nahh. Keep jamming though.  I’m one person.🤷🏽‍♀️
Anderson paak looking like David Ruffin
THIS IS SO CHEESEY. I JUST CAN'T GET INTO THIS RECORD. I STILL LOVE ME SOME BRUNO & ANDERSON THO. THATS IT, THATS ALL. 😂

Turn Closed Caption on... I haven't chuckled too a cool song like this in a while. These lyrics...lol
ONDE ESTÁ A PARTE RUIM DESSA MÚSICA??????????????
How can be this much talent in just one man. Not that he made this song alone, but Bruno Mars keeps on bombing out those masterpieces since I was a little kid. I just adore him! <3 Props to everyone else working on this also.
Proverbs 3:5-6 KJV Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

sad the loop feature is only in the mobile app.
Amazing Blockbuster song is this. Amazing I keep watching this .  As per the below video. End of Humans is very soon.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXs2ua50_fo Even at that time I want to watch this.
Proverbs 10:18 KJV He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.
Proverbs 6:12-13 KJV A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
He must love Motown. Don't really care for the lyrics, but I like the bass, sound, and his voice =)
Paak falling had me rolling hahaha NOT to be dramatic but im dead hahahah. I love me some bruno though! When he hits those high notes, have me on the ground like Paak lol
Year A.O.T.Y they haven't missed yet if the album is like this they really set a bar sonically, need them to grab the air one time and they are certified 😂
He never disappoints.
The humor is key
Proverbs 12:19 KJV The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.
Psalm 101:7 KJV He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
Ima need Janae Monet on the remixxxx
These guys have the road to themselves.. the X factor is - their sense of humor .. you cant find many that can match them - on a talent level, but that chemistry, sense of humor and sense of joy/fun they have is going to  take their careers to a new height- if such a thing is even possible.. Bruno is already an international SuperStar. Silk Sonic have no competitors, period.
When Anderson fell, my gosh, the emotion to this song has is amazing
É tão lindo voltar a ver a romantização do cigarro haha. Vocês são foda!
Fuuuuck i just stopped smoking now i'm craving for a fuckin cigarette
bro🎧📯
For me I guess leave the door open is going to be there only good song so far
If I was Bruno, I wouldn't be able to keep a straight face looking at Anderson on the floor! LOL I'm so dead! lol
So what they saying is she belongs to streets 🤭
Thats a hit
The first time he sang “this bitch…. I was taken aback because I thought it was a love jam. The part where he fell and played dead took me out 😳😳😳😳🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀
Aaaaayyyyyyyyeeeeeeee! I can't wait for the album to drop! Finally, some "feel good for your soul" music!
Damn! How did their cigarettes manage to last the whole song?
this slaps hard
Yo! That “BITCH” really hits hard.😂
Bruno love those whispery falsettos at the end👏🏾👏🏾
Silk Sonic  has created a new music genre: Comedic Soul. Love it! Love them! Love the back-up singers/dancers! 🥰🥰🥰
✅🔥🔥🔥
gay song
Bruno and paak are in there own league. Name another artist or group that can put out one song per month and still have you jamming to old stuff they put out. Come on now!
1:19 got me hooked... Anyone else?
THIS IS SO GOOD😭😭😭😭😭
Aaaaaeeeeeeeeeee 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🗣🗣🗣
1:43 when he actually died as lyrics stated 😮😭😭
amazing
Another One! (DJ KHALED VOICE)
Man, so fly,  got the brown velvet suits with satin Lapels and stripes just oozing smooth vibes while tripping on the lady's jive.
daaaaamn😩😩😩💖
Ese álbum estará demasiado hermoso. 💕
🔥🔥🔥🔥
WHY? WHY? WHY?  RUIN such an ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL SONG with TOTALLY UNNECESSARY VULGARITY!  I couldn't even finish listening?  WHY would any artist want to TURN OFF ANY FANS?  The GREATS, the LEGENDS the OLD SCHOOL ARTISTS just didn't do this?!  Don't think I'll be getting this album after all, and that's so sad!
the comedy, musical arrangement, and the suave-ass moves make them the greatest combo doing it!
they too much! a smooth r&B song with hilarious lyrics and video! they too much! 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Anderson. Paak playing dead took me out!
Shout out to the 1.3K people who hit the dislike button because they could only like the video once. Don’t worry I got you 😉
Grown folks music!!!!!
La combinación perfecta
Wow Bruno Mars’s evolution is just so organic and unique and everything he does he absolutely kills it. Generational talent.
Otra que se convertirá en mí favoritas. 😍😍
Perfect
YASSSSSSS 😩❤🔥
More and more masterpiece🙌🙏
I am literally reliving my childhood by listening to Bruno Mars new songs🤩
How do you call someone a 304 without calling them a 304 lol 😂 I LOVE THIS SONG

Sonic magic….again. Vocals, composition, lyrics, showmanship, videos… A superb duo here. I am excited for the album release.
What you guys do is always so good, I'm impressed.
Love Bruno, love Pak, but also loving the groove of the big dude singing in the back left.

I don't know about you but me I'm loving this squad.
"Not to be dramatic but I wanna die"... that damsel in distress drop damn near killed me...   I don't know why I find this song and their performance so funny and entertaining. It's another hit for sure ^-^/
We need more of these feel good songs.  Don’t you agree?

Nah. I quit smoking over two years ago. One day to the next. Who wants to ache when breathing? Right. Done👉
and just when you thought they couldn't do a better song, they FREAKING DO IT.
It's not innovative, but it's extremely well executed.
vale la advertencia que fumar es perjudicial para la salud de uno y de los demás
Had a blast last night when this fire dropped keepin it real gents rockin in the free world
Yessssss this whole album is going to make me buy a record player ✨
I love this!!!
The cigarette was very not necessary at all! We are in 2021, Ppl know better, those guys should be boycott for promoting a direct passage to disease

Pro tip: Play in 360p to travel back time.
The moves are so smooth 😩😩😩😩🛐🛐
Bringing back the old days music. I was a young kid in the Philippines during the 1970’s. This song brings back good memories and the vibe is so unreal. This album is going to this years  years best. Bruno Mars and  Paak Anderson is on fire🔥🔥🔥 #silksonic

Director: How much smoking do you want in this video? Anderson and Bruno: Yes
I love this song They're all so good together.I just know the CD is🔥🔥🔥 Bringing back that old school vibe and giving you a twist of new school vibes along is just genious.Great Music!

😍
Michael Jackson vibes
Their live show is gonna be rediculous
¿Porque está tan flaco? :c
I love the 70s vibe but also kinda cool
❤️❤️❤️
Oops, they did it again! Silk Sonic is pure musical excellence. We'll see if the smoking  messaging gets criticized, ignored, or used as defense of artistic expression.
I love that they even included old school comedy in this. Even though, I don't know anyone that smokes out the window, or even smokes anymore!, this song is awesome. They're such a good combo, and I can't wait for the album!
I like how clean the translation is, I mean  I learn the lyrics from reading them, and now I'm going to learn it clean.
🔥🔥🔥
❤️🇵🇹❤️
🔥
there is no better music than songs from Bruno Mars we love you Bruno from Kenya in Africa
Amazing
That love story took a turn 😂
ฟังไม่รู้เรื่องแต่เพราะมาก
The 70’s/80’s energy from these videos is incredible. From the shots, set and costumes, right down to the editing. So excited for this album ❤️
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~🎈
They don’t miss
Ok so silk sonic is officially only releasing a banger after another I’m so loving this
Oooh yeah baby Paak and Bruno that’s what will bring world peace
If ever being disrespected sounded  SO GOOD  (sry not sry)
1:44 Why'd she have to do .Paak like that?
i really love your vibes!<3
Great song and video
ANOTHER HIT!!
Brunoooooooo por ti sigo viva nada más
Smoking is disgusting.
Hi Bruno 'n Andy! Pls come here in Amsterdam. I'd love to watch you perform live🎤🎵🎤🎶
We are so grateful for these two bringing a style of music that has been missed for years now and being able to keep true to the old style while bringing modern flair the musicianship is outstanding I hope these two make music for many more years cause they keep hitting the nail on the head with each release
Waooooooo Real music coming back!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥🔥🍾🤩🤩🤩🎼🎼🎼🙏🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎼🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🎼🎼🎼🎼🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😊🎼🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🍾
I feel this song 100%
This is so fckg amazing
THANK YOU FELLOWS FOR BRINGING REAL MUSIC BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SHE FOR THE STREETSSSS
I don't follow the US/Western music scene closely so I wasn't aware Mars and Paak were a full blown project duo but I love it. The mildly comical/cheeky lyrics paired with genuinely good sounding music is a legit blast and I'm here for it.
The New Temptation  😁
Ansiosa para o álbum 💙🦋 Não erra nunca 💙
Yo, holy shit this was flipping amazing
This is like Silk Sonic's response to Destiny's Child song "bills bills bills"
I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS SONG, WHAT NOW? WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?
THEY NEVER FUCKING MISS.
This has to be one of the smoothest ways to say "This chick got me f***** up" in a 3 min summary.
Too much dynamite 🧨🧨🧨🧨 Give you back to the city, damn...
soy yo o bruno mars está en forma? me refiero a que está fitness
Primer comentario en ESPAÑOL esta canción es WOOOW estaba demasiado emocionada por el estreno y la verdad no me defraudaron es más de lo que esperaba ya la AMOOOOO😍❤️❤️❤️

I like this kind of music with a 70s touch on it
Yeah...
Now, this is real music. 🤎
This song is hilarious 😂 I love it!
Peru 🇵🇪✨
Dope track, obviously a new track with and old school feel. Is there some humor or comedy here, or is it just like a modern day rap tune done as a smooth vibe oldie?
1980's vibe premium
i love this duo ❤❤❤☺☺☺❤❤❤❤❤
This song makes me go to my happy place.
Quality of hot 💥
Lmfaoooooooo omg I love them I’m dead 😵 laughing the hook 🪝 This Bi*** got me lol 😂

Silk Sonic is the spelling of VIBE

All these whiny faux sing rappers take notice. This is when talent meets genius!

The culture needed them together 🥰
Another one! 🎹🎹🎶🎶❤❤🎼🎼💯💯

My horney chihauhau has the same problem with his bitches. I love this song. Another hit. Love it!!!!
CLASSIC
I like how they are expressing how a guy feels in this situation. We typically hear songs like this from a woman's perspective!👏👏
Paak playing dead is the best
top
“But I wanna die” then lay down on the floor like the classic crime scene🤣
AMAZING!!!!! ✨✨✨✨
When Anderson.Paak jumped out in front of Bruno with his yellow glasses belting "This bitch got me paying her rent!", I KNEW I was going to love this song! OMG this ensemble is amazingly cohesive, fun and talented!
WTF!? that dude is there again!  I cant take this dude. I thought that we were done with him when he died and was on the floor.
Nowadays we got girls singing about being hookers, and guys singing about being heartbroken by hookers.... keep it up America!!
Intoxicating🚬🚬
SIMP SONG of the year!
Wow 👏 awesome I can't wait for my CD to be delivered 😍...It's going to be a  night of champagne and Silk Sonic.  Now can we Kingdom builder get a chance, lol 😆 I  want some diamonds 💎 on my neck, wrist, and ankle too without having to pay for them.

Bruno es un papasito hermosooo !!todo lo hace bien Dios mío es el significado de talento de perfección amooo
This album ab to do numbers. Real music!
Okay but they just don’t miss… This song was amazing
YESSSSSSSSS!!
The whole 60-80s thing is getting so old. Lately every single video Bruno does looks exactly the same. Just gets boring and makes us not as excited to click the next video, especially when we can see in the thumbnail it’s the same thing again. Just gotta be honest since no one else will.
Welp boutta vibe on the way to work 😂
love
Muito bomm
Love it!!!!!
OMG amazing no more ..!! Really good congratulations guys
que joyita
Bruno no q ya ibas a dejar de fumar 😡😡😡

Creativity at its best love them
Ti amo da 10 anni ,❤️❤️❤️
Anderson Paak looking for a Oscar nomination 🤣
Anderson being dramatic is my new aesthetic🤌🏼😌
so smooth..
Tremenda canción, los amooo :'))
I'm fine if they take awhile to release the album as long as we get a video for every track 😆
whoever disliked this video and song is a loser
Wow! Bravo!! I love it 💜💜💜
ok but how is this the official MV if the instagram promo was in a car???? suspicious....
Damn I had a feeling in my gut I needed to check Silk Sonic.
I like the song minus the b word!
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16 God Loved us all enough to die an excruciating death on the cross and rose again on the 3rd day so that we may also have Life after Death. Through belief in his sacrifice on the cross and belief that he is our Lord and Savior, all you must do is confess with your mouth that you are sinful and in need of a savior. Please. believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior now, he is returning soon my Friends! Time is Short!  May God Bless and Keep you all
Oh my gosh they're unstoppable
Jesus Christ........ at this point this sh$t ain't even remotely fair....
Man bruno never dissapoint
I CAN LISTEN THIS SONG ONE THOUSAND TIMES AGAIN...<3<3<3<3<3

Oh YES! My favorite duo together again in action! LOVE IT <3
This is hilarious lolololol
Album of the year coming
Simplemente HERMOSO <3
These guys are musically comedic to pull such a thing off! ❤😂💯
I like what Silk Sonic is doing musically. Bruno's beautiful voice is showcased so well. The lyrics in this song don't appeal to me, but the melody and dance moves are great.
THIS IS EVERYTHIN
She had him talking to the moon, now he smoking out the window
Not my favorite song but the video is great
Why is y’all calling us a bitch?  I loved it in Suede Anderson, but like damn.. I’m not a bitch. I’m a woman. Try again. Everything else sounds nice doe.
So the song is about a girl who likes a guy to treat them like a queen and left you after all the things you did to her 🤷 she likes the money
Woowww... ❤️❤️❤️ Superb
Their voices are very tasty when placed together. It was your destiny to sing together Mr Mars and Mr Paak, so great. I can’t wait for the other songs of the album !!  We play and sing leave the door open in my music conservatory and it is awesome to sing and play this. 🤩
Anderson on the floor I'm dead LMAO best music out there right now!!!! Keep the hits coming lovin this vibe, brings back so many good feelings!!! HERCULES HERCULES :)
https://youtube.com/shorts/ESf9rdO-0hc?feature=share
Issa
LEGENDARY!!! what a time to be alive
Silk Sonic is one of my favorite group. I normally don't listen to certain music, however, I like Silk Sonic (Old School). I DON'T like that the  group used the (B) word!!!! You guys don't have to use words that dishonor women! NO! Your talent is far above this!!!!!
OMGGGG
?
With all of these singles a rare thing is happening that The hooks and choruses are ok but the verses are god level✨✨✨✨✨
Show
If there's a smoke, there's a fire.
My favorite part 0:33 and 1:53
I know they had a ball recording this material. You can hear it and see it.p
Desde Avello-Queraltó que no conocía mansa dupla 🇨🇱
Hollerin Who Made y'all mad lmaooo, This a vibe tho 🤣🤣🤣
These brothers are just cold 🥶 wit it!!

Big mars paak fan but made me finally subscribe
Haha…keepitup fellas 🔥🥃
This is the most beautiful way to say “she’s a hoe”
🤩🇭🇺
Bruno é puro sexy appeal
I don't buy albums nowadays, but based off the 3 singles I've heard so far from these dudes, I'll buy more than one copy. 🔥
The United States insists on escalating confrontation! Short the dollar will be our choice!
I can remember being a little girl and loving the R&B of the 70's my aunt would always play on her car's AM radio. Now I am almost 50 years old and I am hearing that fabulous 70's R&B coming from one of my favorite singers, Bruno Mars! Hope you fellows keep bringing these sweet melodies to us....brings back great memories for me. ❤
Such a smooth way to say she for the streets 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Patrimônio mundial 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
After listening to lyrics, I wonder how they have not been canceled.
smooth...... slowed version https://youtu.be/OY3MO6EgdAw
❤🇧🇷
Increíble
This is fantastic.  I inly wish that the instrumentalists were sometimes in the shot.  In fact, an instrumental solo or bridge would have added a lot.  I don't want to criticize though because this video and song is right on the money.
👏👏👏👏👏⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Anderson Paak it was found dead
Classic... I bow down for both of y'all..❤️
I love it and it's catching.

Anderson Paak had me dead when he went from lying on the floor to rising from the dead 😂 this video is so money!
Love the “Hercules, Hercules, Hercules” call out from Nutty Professor, 🤣 FIRE 🔥
Anderson smoked that cigarette like Martin when he and Gina broke up.....
At the height of the style, singing, dancing, clothing, everything is there! We like it or we don't like it but they have class and they worked hard for it.
It's magic!
Tight!

Welp….you’ve done it again! I don’t use profanity so I won’t be doing any sing-a-longs 🤣🤣🤣 but this one is 🔥 just like the other ones! Great job, guys ❤️

At a time that I desperately needed my spirits lifted Bruno and Anderson have not failed. Thank you, Bruno, and RIP Honcho, the biggest dog there ever was and ever will be💛. (he’s human and that was something he'd say about himself, his catchphrase.)
If she belongs to the streets was a song
Bruno's vocal is always improving
THAT WAS AMAZINGGG
I love it! The Silk Sonic will revoluctionary the music 🇧🇷
They made Anderson lay on the floor for a good 16 beats😭😭

Delfonics, dramatics with a obvious nod to the jackson 5 with a modern spin of word play,cool comedy play

2022 grammys belong 2 u guys best group of this generation. Got us all gaga.. .and just like her these smooth playa's was born this way
Anderson.Paak and Bruno Mars always releasing new songs and with a little nostalgia for old clips always thrilling listeners.
These two are Easily the best thing to happen to music in the last decade!
Coolest dudes on the planet 😎
ENTAO É ESSA MUSICA QUE EU VOU ME APAIXONAR PELOS PROXIMOS DIAS???
So they couldn't come up with a better description than "this bitch"?. Its sad how music continues to denigrate women and we have normalized it. Silk Sonic is mad talented but I think that phrase was not needed. Smh.. I'll pass Bruno but thanks.
THIS IS ALREADY ALBUM OF THE YEAR 😭
PERFECT OMG
Gostei da música .. e jeito da danças etc.. muito bom 👏👏👏
They never miss
A whole vibe ✨✨✨
Anderson.Paak and Bruno Mars sempre lançando músicas novas e com um pouco de nostalgia de clips antigos sempre emocionando os ouvintes.
Damn they a vibe together
DAMN thanks for bringing old school back love love love ❤
Nice!
Oh my... this is 🔥🔥🔥
In 10 hours 1million😮
Anderson fall and laying on his face literally caught me off guard
Two thoughts: 1. Damn, where can I get one of those suits? 2. This song could've been on the "Hey Love" slow jam LP/cassette/8 track compilation from the 80's (look up the commercial on YouTube youngins 😂).
My Brazilian guy, never dissappoint
Bruno Mars could this by himself without a partner NOT SAYING the other guy can sing
This vibe y’all are giving out. Brings back memories of old school R&B.
Paaaakkkkk, get up man! She don't deserve you! 😅😅😅
💜🌸💜
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CANT DANCE TO THIS NAKED ?!!???!!  <3
🇨🇿❤️🔥Great work as always🔥❤️🇨🇿
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A VIBE DISSO
Always a nice song💯 I love you Bruno Mars❤️
All these Bruno comments meanwhile Anderson is equally doing the damn thing!!!! #PutSomeRespectOnHisName

1:50 did he just die??
Caraca eles não tem uma música ruim
Awesome song
Total perfection, except for the "bitch" part.  Cursing seems to be "necessary" to reel young people in.😔  It reminds me of 70's music.  Soul Train vibes.
Davin Ruffin Reincarnated!!!
Te Amoooooo
Dear do not smoke. Smoking is hazardous to your health
Bukan orang
💕💕💕💕💕
lmao the lyrics are funny as hell
2:45 How many weeks has Bruno Mars been training to land that smooth knee drop?
Me encanta!!! 🥰🥰🥰
The feeling is like stepping into a time machine and stopping in the 70s. And it's a great feeling.
That part 1:33 its so funny  this song it's not complicated. the words are right, the groove everthing. it's when your friend is talking to you about a breakup. ♥

Best colab in this year
I'm going to hate when this group breaks up to make their first solo albums.
Maaaaaaan. It's the carpet for me.
Обожаю его!!!! Бруно класс!!!
Ok enough they need to drop that album. This song is dope
This song is too comical but good. Love how the taller singer to the left of Bruno really be  grooving, so smooth.
Stylistic...
i really like the vids and music too, but in this case singing with a cigarette in the hand is a NoGo! Or does Philip Morris pay for this???
Bruno eres lo mejor que he escuchado en mi vida... I LOVE U 😍😊😘😘😘🇵🇪
What the heck are these lyrics?! Y'all are better than this.
You had me at “this bitch”
Omggggggg this song makes me feel in drog xdddd
🔥🔥🔥
Hey, did y'all peep Bootsy Collins' voice at the beginning doing the opening of the song?
Reminder: silk sonic is Bruno AND Paak
Another winner
What a artist!
Amazing collaboration here just geniuses enjoying making great music
Smooth nigga...Smooth 😴

😁
Yea Boys.... Y'all got another one!!!!

When bruno and Anderson started making songs together I knew I'll be listening to them alot and God dam I love it
Bruno: And here I am all alone Anderson on the floor: *Hell yeah I am*
When Anderson .Paak came in the frame and said, "This B..." with such emphasis I was not ready!! 😂😂😂
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I'm feeling album of the year for this legendary collab.
Thank god for some real music, singing and harmonies to die for 💕💕

Silk Sonic, I see many Grammy's in your future!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯🎶🎶 🏆
Damn, these guys never disappoint. It’ll always be a hit!!!
Nunca deja de encantarme Bruno y ahora con Anderson mucho más 🥰🥰❤️❤️
i hope they make more than one album! been a while since i've enjoyed modern pop
I could be very wrong..but we don't hear anything about Bruno Mars, nothing on internet buzz, or other media buzz, nothing..until he drops a new song/video.  I am convinced Bruno Mars either  A) time travelled back to the 70's for real and decided to stay there and sends songs and videos forward to our time  or  B) was from the 70's originally and time jumped forward to 2010 to try and be an artist in the future...then went back to the 70's because he saw how strange society was getting.
mds entregaram tudo
OMG this video is fire 🔥 🔥🔥 🥰💃💃💃👏👏👏😄😅
THIS B//// GOT ME TOO!!!
Take my money! I’m going to need a physical copy of the album.
El medio tema 💅🥵😈
🌎🌎🔥❤️📀🎼🇩🇿🏆🗽

Sos TAN PERFECTO 😥💞
If someone asks you how perfection looks - show them this or die.
I love the old R&B feel to this song.....and Bruno Mars has the most amazing voice
Es extraordinario, me encantan sus voces juntas. AMOOO <3
I hope modern artists follow this kind of genre to every song, this masterpiece is just out of this world. Nothing feels better than nostalgia.

What I like about Bruno Mars' songs is that they're good even when it's the first time you hear it.
*I guess the guys left their door open for the wrong girl…* 😂
te amo
okay now I gotta get the CD.... lol I'm old school
Great song and Future approves! "She's belongs to the streets"
Anderson Paak is truly one of a kind😁
Yes but where can I find those everlasting cigarettes? Bruh💀
HINOOOOOOO❤
Joder esto si es música!!!! Amo todo ❣️
Surprised youtube doesnt have a health warning about learning out windows at the start
Man said am giving you back to the city with a smooth voice
mj 2.0
Can't nobody do "funny sexy" "sexy funny" like my baby daddy Bruno and dem💜😍😂
Another great song for me to loudly sing in the shower! Damn they sound good
They arent making music, they're making art
Not a fan of this one, seems to be playing on stereotypes of black women.
Wow...great video and again: insane drumfills...the sound is so crisp. Only 7 days and we can enjoy the whole sonic treat.
The zoom out, and you see him still laying there face down on the floor, dead 😂😂😂
This batch Ride....................... Groove!!!!!!!
This was so cold they just lowered the global temperature. Silk just saved us from global warming. Thank them.
Nunca defraudan a la industria los amo
I realy like the style of the music video, their hitting the zeitgeist of bands like The Whispers so well.
What an expensive cigarettes AD
Cultural appropriation,
Anderson and Bruno fusion Gotenks
11 years later and he’s still pumping out hits. He’s simply amazing
classy and sexy....
Amo 😍❤🥰😭🌹🔥🙈😻
Wooooooooooooow
another master piece
I'm old, so forgive me ....the b word!! Owww!! I do know that it is the context for the song, but oww! That said, they are beyond words talented! A new genre has been created Comusic? Cusic? Momedy?( Comedy and music). These guys are telling authentic stories . Uh oh, need to add that to the word...and making me and us smile all the way through the songs. Here's some good news during rough times! Go head' y'all 70's throwbacks!
AYY‼️ 😩🤌
👏👏👏

This is so soothing, I'm proud that Bruno Mars is my countrymen. 💯🇵🇭
I know your dancing..😑😏
I dont know you, but I am still waiting the explanation from bruno about why now is not Just Bruno Mars, why silk sonic?
Anderson popping in like that saying "This Bitch" is a whole mood. 🤣🤣  Somebody please make this a meme.
Bruno might be the only artist who doesn't know how to make bad songs
The whole album never failed me so far, they all good!!
Not Anderson laying on the floor like that 😂😂💀💀💀
paak on the floor and then popping back up 😂
They've done it again 🔥 🔥 🔥. Also the series of foot stomps that matched the beats was great.
good job bruno blessings 🙏🙏💪💪❤️🔥

Guys... lose the butts... no wonder she left your smelly asses. Otherwise very nice.
They’re basically saying “She’s for the streets” but in a smooth way loll
🤓🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Don't like the glamorizing of smoking from such top stars but the arrangement and 90% of the lyrics are on point
I grooved and laugh, I feel good to this.
Sensational ‼️ Any beat from this contagious rhythm group is smoking 🔥 The message is most likely clear to those who partake of nicotine, they don't sugar coat a thing😄. But I wish they'd expressed how that irregardless of an insecurity of a relationship or any circumstance, to never fall into the manufacturers world of nicotine.🚭 Stay strong. I enjoy the classic entertaining ambience of their songs, music, steps, and style! 🕶️ The video is no way promoting it, abstract. God gave freewill. 🚭 BRUNO MARS, THE BEST! 👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽 🎉🎉Happy New 2022 soon!🎉🎉🎉
I like how this song made me groove even though the message is about how some b*tch made silk sonic made this song.   I hope I made sense HAHAHA.
Cant wait for the album!
I love you Bruno 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🥰🥰🥰
I liked the song, but I hate cigarettes. I can imagine the stink in the studio.
This is Platinum
WOWWWWWWWWWWW👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I LOVE YOU BRUNO

Is this why u needed to leave the door open?
Old style is Gold
POT FARMER DANCE SONG $ I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot You better believe it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes They did nothing but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis could not walk around I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack After I smoked some to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around  Got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where wild birds nest  Found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail  Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in a camouflage suit  Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn’t be found. Came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone  I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!  By Kansas City Poet Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!

1:43 LOL🤣 die... Literally... OMG... 🤣😂
Everything Anderson Paak touches turns to gold.
Performance impecável como sempre! Bruninho faz tudo!!! 😍👏🏾
I've grown up listening to Bruno Mars. I'm now 17 years old and listening to this song makes me so happy, I can't even describe it. He always manages to show off everytime since he has the ability to show off his feelings and express them while singing (especially when he hits the high notes). I just have to say, hats off to Bruno. This collaboration is FIRE. From Leave the Door Open, to Skate, and now Smokin Out The Window. Though this song is different than the other two because of the beat. It's so chill and relaxing but at the same time it makes you want to dance? I can't explain it. But this song is definitely a masterpiece. I'm so proud of them all (the ones that collaborated in this song). I'm happy to know that I've been growing up to his music too! Makes me super happy. I'm definitely blessed.     If you read all this, I just want to say that you're all wonderful people. Don't ever give up in your dreams and fight for you want. Take care <33

I miss the old Bruno Mars 💔
I guarantee you Paak laying on the floor and Bruno just singing over him is going to be a new meme
My god rhe lagacy of Marvin and Barry White still alive. Thank you
This song is on repeat my whole life✌🏾🙏
Thia song is making me LMAO!!! Damnn!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don’t agree with using the B-word or promoting smoking 😩.  I like the sound and don’t expect to love every song on the album. Anxiously waiting for Nov 12 to hear the entire album.
This BITCH!!!!  HAHA he never disappoints! I'm ready for the concert! Yeah I know he has an album coming out next week but he can go ahead and drop those tour dates because i'm ready and I already know that the album is going to be FIRE🔥🔥🔥!!!!!!
Cant help but feel happy and good after listening to this
😍❤💞
love this rhyme. Anderson .Pakk always so great
Bruno and Anderson so perfect! I Love so much! The vocals so wonderful ❤
this is smooth i love it
It’s sooo good 😍🔥❤️🤤love that
My dude straight died in the middle of the video then came back singing. I’m crying over here ☠️
Just so excited for this whole album you just are on the mark each time but boy this music speaks to me and my husband.  A style when music was so good.  Bruno and Paak you guys are perfect.  Thank you.
Yeah men
Jackson’s “Never Can Say Goodbye” vibes and I love it. ❤️‍🔥❌💯❤️‍🔥❌💯❤️‍🔥❌💯
Sensacional... Voltamos aos anos 70
how is every bruno song fire
"Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die”  *camera pans out and Anderson actually on the floor 😂
Well, so-so.
I love it!!! Damn!!!
A masterpiece❣❣❣❣
VOCÊ FUMA!
This was so good! From the melodies to the lyrical content to the comedy feel! Well done guys! Can’t wait for the whole project! 👏🏾
e eu achando Skate, leave the door seriam as melhores.. ai ai que incrível! <3
I'm so addicted to Silk Sonic... it's an entire vibe that you just can't get from anything else that's out right now... it's a beautiful mix of grown and sexy with new school flava. Keep it coming!!
omgggg ackkkk!!!!
Asd
They are GOLD
Ele entrega tudooooo😍
These dudes are just having the best time making music together.
Yoooo this song got a damn lick to it . I can even see Snoop Dogg on a remix. With his smooth flow... With all the garbage music out there I can honestly say I have a full album to anticipate. I know every track is gonna be worthy..They say the release date is next Friday..I am there!!! Remind me of how I couldnt wait for Mary J Blige album releases...Don't know why the industry ain't on and poppin..there is a demand for "real" music. We shouldn't have to wait almost every decade for gems like this to drop..Gwan Bruno and Anderson with oonu bad selves. ❤️❤️❤️❤️🇯🇲🇨🇦
Top demais👏👏👏👊❤
Love it love it " Now That's Singing" an what it is to perform with "Class" Love you Guys
😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😂😂
Un Dominicano mirando a Bruno y Anderson los mejores
Love, love, love!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WoW Silk Sonic is so smooth and they harmonize perfectly together.
Rock bruno
Great song, but who came up with the idea of a video of cool guys smoking indoors in 2021?
Mais uma musica perfeita para nós! Achei desnecessário o tabaco.
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...this Bitch got me!
Me encanta este estilo, definitivamente esta unión está cosechando grandes éxitos.
Bruno will always be my favourite
Silk Sonic is my new musical obsession. I need more of this soul music.

Andersons fall and pop up😂😂. Another hit 🔥
They’re literally talking about my relationship 👀👀
eu amo a forma que eles fazem de cada um ter seu momento de brilhar.
😍😍😍😍😍
This song sounds like it came from the ‘70s. The video looks like a performance on Soul Train or Midnight Special! Of course, if it had been made in the ‘70s, the words this (b-bomb) would have been this girl.
This is another banger!!!!!  Damnnnnnn this was a dope song.  Anderson was a fool for dying on the floor though 🤣 😂
Video lit! 🔥🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/JhLw8UEforc
The king of pop is back
❤️❤️❤️
Perfect ❤️
I’m glad I love his music…. No vulgar words …. Never disappointed and obsessed with him ❤️
What a pleasure to be listening to this for the first time stoned under the duvet
I love you Bruno Mars.

Joshua bassett
I thought Anderson died 😂😂 he just jumped up 😅😅

I've been looking up to Bruno ever since his debut. Wow, I was 8 years old when Doo-Wops and Hooligans came out.
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT ‼️‼️ Can’t wait for the album
This is pure sexy...yal sexy
I see silksonic and I know it’ll be amazing! Never disappointed. Anderson you sound soooo good
Eu só quero ver quem vai ganhar dessa dupla. Eles formaram um ótimo par. Difilcilmente eles serão abatidos por outros.
I need a cigarette
Bruno is the definition of being SEXY.

Dam!! Dam!! Dam!!  I just can't stop listen you got me smoking out this piece..Hands down to the best group out there..👏👏👏👏. Stay true to your selves, your music, and dont let this industry try to cult your ass to the other side... You are all so talented. Wow!!
She had them fellas screaming Hercules Hercules 😂😂
This man are a magician 🔥😍 This content hits differently 🔥
Jackson five vibes I love that
Watched the entire video but all I could see is a broke down dude driving smoking out the window.
YOOOOOO 🤣🤣👏🏾👏🏾
Silk Sonic has done it again ...your melodious sound never fails and your moves are always amazing...Another award winning hit 🌹❤🌹❤🌹❤
Silk Sonic is one of the most important new voices in contemporary music.  They are shaking up the sound of hip hop and rap with a soul sensibility that's been lacking for a very long time.  More power to them and, hopefully, a lot more music.
I loved every second of that.
Eu amo vcs pqp
Chills pure chills🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
THEY HAVE DONE IT AGAIN!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 I'm so ready for this album!
O cara sempre entrega tudo é brabo demais fenômeno perfeito chega men surpreende mais por saber que é mais uma porrada que vai vim com certeza adoro demais o trabalho desse cara agora com essa parceria ficou d+.😶✌✌✌✌✌✌✌
caralho é boa demais, mas o clipe é brega ein
Silk sonic is the best musical impulse of the year. Great musicians - fantastic
