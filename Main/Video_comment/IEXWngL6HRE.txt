That Werner Koch try was crazy
There are some other things to point out. Rugby is a very hard physical sport, like Boxe,  in which African coloured men ( and women) are better suited than Caucasians. It is unfair that South African franchises, that are made up of mainly super- gym- Black Africans, are allowed to play against a team composed of Whites. I think that it should exist a "Rugby White Championship" and a "Rugby Coloured Championship", because it is impossible that  whites can compete, in rugby, with Blacks. Before 1995 South African national team did not win World Cups, in 1995, with many Blacks such as Brian Habana, they won against New Zealand
As former rugby professional players pointed out, South African franchises are far more stronger than any European club. It is not a surprise that only Irish franchises, that build-up players can stand up and achieve some victory.  The Cell C Sharks are supported by government , Harlequins are a private- owned club that relies only on his own money and on the youth rugby school of the city in order to drag some young players. Maximum respect, but it is unfair that SA play with European clubs. It is like, in soccer, brasilian top teams play in Portugal Championship...
Well all South African teams are doing good so far
Why is the stadium so empty?
Stadium is empty very surprising, its a shame for sa clubs. It means there is no interest in this compétition, this not sounds good
Esterhuizen can be so overpowered at times
Ryan wearing we see u
Stransky: "The laws of the modern game unfortunately..." Yup, absolutely killing rugby union!
Ox cited and suspended for 3 week for a "dangerous" tackle is pathetic. I see 2+2=5 for the law makers. If that is dangerous, any tackle is dangerous so we need to play touch.
Well done to the Cell C Stormers.
2:52 Harlequins player entering ruck from the side cause Bongi to go off his feet, but no you cant blame refs...
South African teams in the championship league,so if a South African team wins the competition they'll be crowded European champion's (euro_afro champs)very interesting
This stadium emptier than my wallet
Unbelievable effort sharks. something has to give with these head contact calls. That was a 50/50 clash of heads and most teams would have collapsed after that red card.
The views on this video is significantly more than any other championscup game of the weekend. Any thoughts on why?
Quins were good against 13 men : )
Unlucky red card.
All these red cards now are ridiculous. Ox literally just performed a text book tackle as the charging opponent began to lose his footing. Barely any contact and it’s a red? Come on.
That was not a red card. Contact with head is not a red card. It is only red card if there is a high degree of danger. The ref explains it and says there was a high degree of danger... he actually struggles to say it coz he's lying. These refs are paid believe me.
That pass from Hendrikse to give Mapimpi his second try was incredible 🦈
Bullshit red card. Game is becoming a joke
im not sure why people cry that jaden is too slow the man is a brilliant 9 and successor to faf
Some of those sharks tries 🚀🚀🚀
Mapimpi finally high fived someone 😂🔥
It's funny that Esterhuizen was mediocre for the Sharks, is kak when playing for the Boks, but performs for Harlequins
No ways red card! But okay, bend and send
so ridiculous to have sa teams in champions cup
That red card was so unnecessary
Kwazulu Natal 👍🏼👍🏼👊🏼
Nothing more satisfying than watching the virtue signalling woke Harlequins getting destroyed
Red card really was a joke. High danger?! Stop killing the game of rugby by making it soft! Next is pads and helmets to protect the players. How about making it into quarters? Oh wait you already have drink breaks. Its becoming a joke really.  World rugby is slowly killing the sport we love and making it into a shadow of itself.
What a performance by the Sharks especially considering that they played with a man less. The tries from Werner Kok & Mapimpi were superb.
Looks like SA must practise 13 man rugby in this red card lottery ! Nice rugby enjoyed it , well done !
South Africa is not Europe. A bit like Australia in the Eurovision song contest, it’s stupid.   What next? The winners of the Copa Libertadores to join the expanded UEFA Champions League…
Bravo les Shark
Le carton rouge il y a rien le joueur glisse en plus il le ceinture au niveau  du buste c'est sa tête qui heurte la poitrine du pilier sud africain
Jo Marler enjoying his Saturday afternoon strolls.
Great game but how did the quiens not score with 2 off the pitch well  played sharks
Love the Banana Boys (Sharks)..
Rugby has become a joke to watch  South Africa are getting penalised 20x more by every ref, I only watch highlights now as it’s too frustrating to watch and even in the highlights it’s ridiculous red cards, yellows and massive coward passes missed, so over crooked amateur refs destroying gif game I used to love
Red card another embarrassment to rugby.
Il cartellino rosso è pura idiozia
the best bit for me was the lady 6.21 - she was having fun
Red, how?
Red, how?
Ref made it close
The laws are not doing the game any favors, sorry. All players go in low and head contact will happen. How can you give red cards for it when the intention is to defend and hurt? Fact makes the game more dangerous, because how can 13 men play against 15 and you call it safe? Yellow should be as in football. After 2 yellows for a team, red. But, the red card player must be replaced. there must always be 30 players on the field. 8 Players on the bench, but only 5 strategic replacements allowed per team. The red card makes it 4 left. Injured players must be replaced and does not count as part of the 5. The front row must have professionals doing the job.
I stopped watching at 3:40....Yet another invalid red card
Where are the Quins traditional jersey?
High tackle but very good jackal
Ref was useless. This sharks team gelling will be hard to beat
Not a red card
Rediculas yellow card rediculas red card despite that great game till the end.
I keep seeing people complain about the red cards given for head contact, whether you agree with the law or not isn't the point, that is the law and if you hit someone in the head and there are no mitigating circumstances then the ref has to give a red card , the answer is simple learn to tackle lower it isn't as if this hasn't been the law for sometime now. Good game though.
I think those are the worst cards I've seen.
These red cards are killing the game.
The best player for the sharks was without doubt the ref, so many forward passes were ignored it was more like football match.
great game, welcome to the euros SA. hopefully the country's reputation and dignity can be restored somewhat.
Pommies getting moered again by the South Africans hahaha
Fair play… great attack from both teams
That yellow card looked questionable, I'm fairly sure the HAR player pulled number 2s leg causing him to go off his feet.
Sharks! Yes! What a show of character. Not long ago, they'd have lost that match. Mapimpi's first try was unbelievable. Guy had no business just carving through the middle like this. What an absolute legend.
Red card was a joke.
As a sharks fan, could someone please explain HOW DA FAK Mapimpis try was given? With all the rubbish TMO interference there is why wouldn't that be checked?
What bs laws earned the sharks a red and yellow? This FIFA crap will start making these games as farcical and unwatchable. Great rugby by both teams, inspite of the officiating...
Red card is really pathetic and at the end the right team came out winners.
What a cracking game of rugby :)
Soft cards are irritating and hurting the game. They really are making the game soft. What next, pads? Last try was brilliant! Andre had a good game
Wish they could add the best teams from the super rugby here so we can teach the north how to play rugby
Have to say it's disappointing to see not many in the stadium
Francois Venter showing he is way better than Kriel
Such a soft red card. The game is getting ridicules with cards. It’s ruining the contest
How was Nche’s tackle a red card? Absolutely ridiculous.
Red card was a joke
The red was absurd
Shark's, more like the jellie fishes. 🪝
Ridiculous red card!
Cracker of a game.
These red cards are killing the game
Glad to see the refs are allowed to wear the actual uniform and not just the SA uniform...always been a pet peeve of mine in URC that
Springboks will crush any English teams in this comp.
Esterhuizens always welcome in the Shark tank. Man...Can he play 👍🇿🇦
Our Saffa refs and TMOs are the worst 🦈🇿🇦
3:51 this rule used in this manner is going to kill rugby.
F@ck these stupid red cards…what are the powers that be thinking ?
Never a red what a joke 😂
That red card was absolute bullshit. No question, no debate, absolutely bogus decision from the refs!!!!!! The game never would've gotten that close if the refs didn't give the Quins advantage handjobs with those shit cards. Good on the sharks for holding out AND winning the game with a league team! 👍
Hey guys The incident with OX, is that a new rule? Im not a referee, but would like tho understand the rules... my goodness...OX redefine the term running into an brick wall.. but why was it red?
Jesus Christ a fucking red card for that. These refs clearly are trying to ruin this sport
That red card call was pathetic How can anybody run on ANY sport with your head behind your shoulders, your head had to be in front while you are running Tappe Henning jy Moet begin om jou skeitsregters begin leer om hoe werk die menslikke ligam It's a scandal how the referees and the TMO judge these things also the referees don't want to make the decisions on field so they keep passing it to the tmo to decide World Rugby and the URC need to wake up and get things sorted out
That red card tho?
Stadiums are all empty. Sharks were empty, Lions were empty, even 7s were empty. Clubs are going bankrupt and closing down. Because we don't ever get fair matches anymore. Every game now has cards and over officiating that ruins the match. We are watching the collapse of a sport in front of our very own eyes.
How on earth is that a red card
My Lord Mapimpi is a joy to watch.
Wow!  That last try was a bit tasty!!  Well done, from a Quins man.
All 16 Sharks played well! Was good to see Andre back in Durban. 😂
Notshe keep showing them how we play rugby here in the eastern cape bra ,always looking to offload and using your brain instead of bashing into people all day
🇿🇦🦈🇿🇦🦈🇿🇦🦈🇿🇦🦈
2nd replay I have watched today. 2nd ridiculous red card....I loved rugby.....
After getting a Yellow card and a Red Card, the Sharks not only held on, but managed to score the last try, absolutely brilliant!!
Well played Sharks..well tried Quinns ..
Some good dominance from the Sharks for a lot of it. Suspect this game and other SA games will come up for the so called ref analysts channels. Also red card was skipped over and why is some of harlequins team missing? Anyway we'll done Sharks.
That Ox Nche dubious red card sums up the direction world Rugby is going, that is NOT a red card in the 150 plus years of rugby, but in the last 2 years it is.  It's got nothing to do with player safety either, the upcoming world cup is gonna be like the FIFA 2002 world cup when it comes to match fixing and rigging games.
That Hendrikse pass at 1:40 is just filthy😤🤬
Amazing, highlights immediately after the game. Supersport would've waited till tomorrow.
These Saffa Teams are making good ground in Europe!
