4rabet pe jo cashback bonus hai, usse har loss pe kuch na kuch wapas milta hai, bilkul badiya
4rabet pe daily rewards bhi milte hain, har din kuch na kuch jeetne ka chance milta hai, amazing
Bhai 4RA pe no deposit bonus bhi milta hai, bina deposit kiye bet karo aur jeeto, kamaal hai
4rabet ka loyalty points program bhi bohot accha hai, points collect karke extra bets milti hain
Yaar 4ra ke weekend bonus se weekend pe zyada khelne ka maza alag hi hai, full paisa vasool
4ra ke s me participate karna bhi faaydemand hai, bonus aur prize money dono milte hain
Bhai 4ra ka reload bonus bhi zabardast hai, har baar deposit karo aur bonus pao
4rabet pe free spins bhi milte hain, games khelne me aur bhi maza aata hai
Yaar 4RA ka birthday bonus bhi super cool hai, apna birthday aur bonus dono celebrate karo
4ra ke loyalty program se bhi bohot points milte hain, jitna khelo utna fayda
4rabet pe daily login bonus bhi milta hai, bas login karo aur bonus pao, bohot easy
Mujhe 4ra ka refer-a-friend bonus bohot pasand aaya, friends ko bhi laaya aur bonus bhi mila
4rabet pe weekly cashback bhi milta hai, har week kuch na kuch jeetne ka chance
Haan yaar 4RA ke welcome bonus ne toh pehli baar me hi maza de diya tha, bohot badiya
Bhai 4rabet pe itne saare bonuses milte hain, pehla deposit bonus hi double milta hai
That’s a great idea! Betting is always more fun with friends around, and those bonuses for referring them seem pretty generous.
I'm thinking about getting some friends involved with the referral bonus. It looks like a good deal for both sides
Absolutely, the cashback saved me last week. It’s k after a lossa good feeling to get something bac
Did you notice the cashback offers? It's nice to know there's a fallback if things don’t go well
Yes, those reload bonuses can be a lifesaver, especially when you hit a rough patch. Helps to keep playing without breaking the bank
Have you looked at the reload bonuses They seem perfect for keeping the game going after the initial play
That sounds like a good plan. I spread my bonus across a few casino games, tried a bit of roulette and blackjack
I'm thinking of using it to bet on the cricket matches. There's a big game coming up, and that extra bonus could really come in handy
I did, and I used it as soon as I signed up. It really gave my initial bets a nice cushion. What about you
Currently Mike hayesman, Mark Nicholas,  Ian Smith, Michael holding & Ravi Shastri are the best commentators.

Harry Brooke take a 🙇‍♂️ bow.

Am I the only one who noticed salt plays like McCullum bazz
How flat was this pitch ?
doston, 4ra ke saath IPL enjoy karo aur bade prizes jeeto! Every game, har ek moment, chance hai jeetne ka
Match ka thrill badhao, points se rewards paao!4RABeT pe har over can be a chance to win big with gamification.
BMW ticket ka sapna dekh raha hu, 4ra se better chance kahi nahi milne wala Let’s not miss out this time!
sach batau toh, last time jo ₹10 Lakhs mila tha kisi ko, uspe meri nazar thi Next draw mein hum sabka number aayega
yaar, those Apple Watches aur Samsung Galaxy phones from 4rabbit dekhe? Next time hum mein se koi jeet sakta hai! Let's go for it!
Bada Dhamaka Karne Ka Waqt Aa Gaya Hai! 26 April IPL Lottery Ke Liye Register Karo Aur 4rabat Ke Saath Badi Jeet Paao!!! Jaldi karo, doston!
Main toh iPhone 15 Pro Max jeetne ka sapna dekh raha hu from 4rab. Kya swag hoga!
Socho, agar woh 10 lakh ka prize 4RABT se jeet jaye toh kya baat hai! Sapne sach ho jayenge.
"Arre dosto, dekha kya 4ra ka new IPL lottery? Every year aur bhi zabardast ho raha hai!
Guys, remember the dates! Wouldn't wanna miss any draw. Especially the BMW raffle on 4 rabbit. It's the big one.
guys, let’s register together for 4ra lottery on April 12, can't wait to see who wins! group luck maybe?
Count me in! But yeah, faced some issues with withdrawal last time. Hope 4ra sorts it before the IPL lottery ends. Looking forward to the April 12 draw.
Did anyone actually win something big from 4 RABET before? Deposits and stuff always a hustle for me.
Joining 4 RABAT's lottery is a no-brainer, guys! Let's win big this IPL season. Who's in?
Dreaming of that ₹10 Lakhs win with 4 RBT, what would you all do with the money? Imagine the possibilities if you hit the jackpot right on April 12.

West indies team fell off now they're playing great again like the early 2000's.  England used to be so good. What happened to them?   I used to watch cricket a lot in the 2000's and recently been watching it again here and there.   I was surprised to see England get knocked out of the world cup so early. Another team i remember was Zimbabwe, they also used to be good. Times have changed.

Sab prasidh Krishna ko gali de re the. Itne experience khiladi ne bhi last over me 21 nahi bacha paya
better than shanaka inning against aus 2022
I'm pretty sure this chase will hard for Indian batters because of big ground and slow pitch
Sell out
England is back 😗❤
Indian commentator should learn something from Bishop There is nothing wrong in praising the good game unlike Indian commentators always busy on praising their own players despite the performance of opponents
My favourite team England ❤
After Sign In Ipl here✅🥵
Westindies is fit for T20 not for test and odi ..all are power hitter..

Toofani match 😮😅
Sam curran 5'9 he is not short

No ad  is written on WI jersey I feel for them 😦😦😦😧😧😧
So sad😢
3-2 series win by West indies😊
Remember the name salt and brook.
वेस्टइंडीज किक्रेट टीम🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹

No last over drama🥱
Owsam lan bishop u beauty

love to see west indies winning t20 world cup
Selute to Brook 💪💪💪💪
SRH realise in IPL2024  brook is  really good batsman
Similar to 2016 finals
We really missed that kinda commentary from the very long time.. Super exciting n chilling commentary by Ian Bishop..  Again Worst Bowling by WI.. 🧐
4:24 Big Balls bouncing
Ground looks so small
Forde should replace holder
West indians hitting ball like bullets 😂, and best cricket commentry
West Indies performance reminds me of sky good at t20 but sucks in the odi's
Eng land  win
These kinds of matches keep  the cricket alive. Congrats, England
Magnificent game of cricket.. Both the teams must be congratulated.. No doubt.. Salt must  be the Man of the Match despite the end over heroic s of Brooke... Because Salt carried his bat through.. And that is the Opener's Role.. Congrats to England for winning the match to level the series... All the best...

Very bad balling of WI
Sheer brute force hittings and an absolute carnage from both teams. I don't understand though what's with the full toss deliveries by Windies.
Peshawar zalmi ❤❤❤❤🎉

Salt is one of the best innings top class bating❤
Really poor bowling from russell
India sports channel this cricket update 2024
What a game .....!!!!!👏👏👏👏
Never understood why Russel is given the final over. He always leaks a lot of runs, sprays all over the pitch
Even street cricket players will bowl better than Russell
Brook❤
Poor bowling from both sides
England best of luck ❤
West Indies bowling was waaay off.
226/3 record run chase very good playing england team philp salt ji ,.harry brook ji will jacks ,.ji livingstone ji uture for england team  🙏🙏 ⛳☀
There are two machines in cricket : Jason Holder and Virat Kohli. Kohli scores them with the bat and Holder scores them with the ball
West indies have started to give up. The bowling was mediocre. To many full tuss
I once heard a great former West Indies cricketer said, he has never seen Russell bold a decent over. Anyways t20 is like that, you dished it out and you also have to accept it
Russell been bowling pies all series...
How much does it look like Joss needs some time with the wife and kids
Ian Bishop voice 🔥
West Indies couldn’t defend over 250 against S Africa and now they can’t defend over 220 to England. When the World Cup comes around they better practice their coin toss technique.
Bowling Russell in the last over was an awful decision
After a long time england purchase smile😂❤
Worst bollwing wi 17 balls 57 runs so difficult but bowling is so worst
What a magnificent cricket match. I think this is the historical match in cricket history.
Only got to watch these highlights but a magnificent victory for England
31 off 7 deliveries, Brook you fkin drugga
harry brook took revenge for the 2016 final exactly how carlos braithwaite did it
To every Carlos Brathwaite there will be Harry brook🎉
Greatest T20 win of all time from ENG
Outstanding chase 😊🎉❤
"Carlo Braithwaite Carlos Braithwaite, remember the name..."" those lines of 2016 t20 final.. legendary
14:20 Who Else remembers Virat Kohli🔥😏
Where is Joshua Bishop...way way better than Hossain.....as a bowler and batter
😮😮😮😊
Amazing
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Best of luck Salt & Brook Congratulations for team England ❤
Love you the great bishop ❤
Beauty of the cricket 😮 both team
Great batting salt
Outstanding sixes from brook,  he is the beauty  of this beautiful victory.

Brook 31 from 7 are so underrated😮
Oo
West Indies gave away the Match. The Match was always in their favour
Revenge
Congratulations team England ❤
Woooow  what a betting  England 🇬🇧 team  super amazing  congratulations
What a chase , bravo England
Based on observation, the fans supported both teams!
Harry brook is my favourite ❤️🇧🇩
You can really tell Ian Bishop really enjoys the game for what it is and is really passionate about it regardless of who does well.
Brook looks very Dangerous 😮
Westindies is the best team of T20 but they don't have good bowlers
What A Match ❤️❤️
Commentary King Bishop
What a great T20..  🎈
Ian Bishop : The living Legend, ❤
Good unbiased commentatory unlike Indian commentators...
Miss you DJ Bravo ❤❤
Strike rate of 442.85..Harry Brook you beauty
Old black is come t20 history ❤
As west indian fan...i cant blame westindies..it was just a good game of cricket..kudos to englad.they have kept this series interesting
one of a miracle in t20 history ♥
2024 T20Wc, going to be more interesting in Caribbean pitches.
Windies cricket always full of vibes
Tymale mills career ended today
Great win england..windies bowling fail
Sad to see ... WI couldnot defend this total 😢
Necholas pooran next captain west indians ❤ best
Holder is becoming a spin bowler 😂
West Indies should have won the match but the bowling was very poor very poor
Wow wonderful game ❤❤❤
Weres the final over drama ? Wickets ? 😅
EA cricket real life 😂❤
Man of the match Ian Bishop for his entertaining commentary 😊
Really happy thay England and West Indies are back into their form❤🎉
World class commentry ian bishop world class run chase
Coming at crease at a time when there is immense pressure on the team and then scoring those shots like a master, is what guarantees a bright future for this batting sensation, Harry Brook. Gem of a chase. 👏
❤️‍🩹
21 in 6 balls.  WI: we have got this game wrapped up.  Brook: hold my cricket bat.
Well Played England ❤
West Indies captain is the definition of idiocy, why would you use Russell the bowler with the highest average to bowl the final over in both T20.
west  indies  throw  away  the  match. The  captain  should  have  used  Mayers. You  cannot  defend  222  in  a  t20  match? So  disappointing.
England have been playing pretty poorly for a while but this was a fantastic run chase, so hopefully it marks a return to form and isn't just a false dawn. Here's hoping they can make a better fist of defending their T20 crown than they did their ODI crown.
Harry Brook Is My Favourite Player in Current English Team,,, Well Done Brook❤👍
Cracking game. Great entertainment by both sides. Looking forward to the next one.
After tony grieg my favourite commentator bishop
What a match!!
Brook securing the IPL bag lol

Congratulations for england wi well played.what a entertaining match
Throw this old and aged Russel out of the team
Extraordinary
Class Batting by SALT & BROOK 🔥
West Indies have No Special Bowler to Control the Other Team
Superb run chase ❤️
Different venue match play betwean.So that very very well visitors .
Harry Brooks looks like the Ben stokes of coming days  Future of England
Fixing match
2 very average sides- Atkinson is simply awful. Over coached robot
Short but Sweet Innings from Brook❤
IPL Dre Russ For WI Andre failure Russell
Now this what I call a rivalry!! What a match! Tremendous striking from both teams. This century from salt is truly remarkable and the finishing to top it off from Harry. It was probably just a good batting day for england but if the wendies get a new 140+ bowler they'll have a much better bowling attack. Russel and holder aren't doing it. Hats off to Ian bishop aswell for such an unbiased commentary 👏
England t20 parfomance wourld class Defending t20 chiompions 💖
As a West Indian fan, I’m secretly happy England won… I want the next match in TT to be exciting because I’ll be in the stands!😬😁  Bring it home in 4, WI🏏✨
Fans from Sri Lanka ❤🇱🇰
What a game!!!  What these six!! O my goodness 😮
Great commentary from Ian Bishop. Just added to the spectacle. Great game. All to play for now
Andre Russell is trash
Old windies ❤
Why were the boundaries so far in? Looks like a woman’s game
Tremendous match ❤❤
That's one hell of a commentatory..    Ian Bishop Salute...🫡
3rd class bowling and fielding from West Indies 😂 222 is target! , defending 222 is nothing but a cup of tea,shame on their poor bowling performance 😂
West indies need to play Shepard and rest Russell his tired
what was the drama in the last over, absolutely disgusting bowling but great batting no doubt.
West indies lack of fast bowlers😢
T20 at it's best. ❤
Credit goes to Andre Russell for bowling a shit load of poor bowling.  That's why WestIndies needs regular players to play for country not a crap load of experienced part time cricketers.
Great game of Cricket ❤
Harry brook getting back to form by ipl season 😂😂😂
The boundary seem very narrow... the six 's wouldn't happen in Old Trafford..
What a t20 match 😎🔥😎🔥
God bless you all 🙏
Best last over drama
😮😮😮😮😮
dear wendies, please atleast change your DJ and cameraman plz
oh oh uk
Russell is so poor in bowling
England ❤❤
Ian Bishop's commentator is a bit too intense for an irrelevant match
This is just pure magic! How can a team can won when its need probably 98 from 38 deliveries 😮😮
Master Brooks 🥰
Smashing sixers ✌️
England had been at receiving end since the ashes, the the WC and even the ODI series vs WI along with 1st 2 t20is  The ROAR by brook and salt in the end shows how much this meant to them
Wow!
Well played salt+harry brook👍🏻
🔥 game
That's why I like brook❤
Russell can retire after that final over. Thank you for your  great service.  Go in good grace.
Boundaries look really short...
Where was the drama?
Keeping  West Indies outside from wc was very disappointing
Sir ian bishop is best commentetor❤❤
Commentary of Ian Bishop 🔥
most use less bowlers in West Indies squad = jason holder & andre Russell 😂
Bowlers were smoked bad 😂. Batting was superb by both teams
Amazing knocks from multiple batsmen
Russell batting very strong but I think he shouldn't bowling at final over, I was supported to England from the Beginning and Win and that's a great Win. Love from Bangladesh
💥💥👌👌
Poor bowling by West indies they gave lot of full toss for England batters
Harry Brook Is The Pure The class Batter, He is fit for Any Format of the Game

The man of the match is: ian bishop.. What a neutral commentary’!!
Wow
Indies Ian Bishop is praising England while his home country is losing.Thats the beauty of game.Indian commentators should learn this.Indian media and commentary is so biased.
Salt need Brook then 🗿💥
What a run-chase this has been! Harry Brook has played most impressive 7 deliveries of his young career🔥🏏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿

Shafared is better option than Russell.
So finally in 3rd t20 Russell completed his mission he failed in 2nd t20.
Commentry level💥💥
England revenged of 2016 T20 world cup 😊.. similarly same situation in the last over in 2016😂
*W.I.* batted excellently but bowling was too average Because England batting showed their capability 🏏 *2 - 1*
Just proves bowlers are dumbest people😂 you need 21 i will give you 25 ...another player in prasidah krishna club....full tosses😂
This was a brutal fight❤❤❤ I enjoyed it sooooo much❤❤ THIS IS WHY WE (the People) LOVE CRICKET❤❤
The screams u hear after Brook wins the game is just dam good
The worst bowling line-up is of West Indies...

Harry Brook : Lahore Qalandars product ❤️
Idk why they let russell bowl ...he makes no sense bowling to me ...all he does is give the teams alot of runs

Extremely poor bowling by West Indies. There, bowling has been a major problem.
omg

Mighty ipl Alrounder Russell 😂😂😂
Awesome 🎉
New star in the making remember thee name harry brook 🎉
Come on England 💪🔥🩸
Fantastic match
That offside six from harry brooks is  just pure class
Why Russell 🥭?
Best..........
Rutherford is best than Hetmayer
Hitman Rutherford
What a game ❤❤🎉
What a Match
Phil  really rubbed SALT into West Indiea wounds.Great game by both sides  to bad there had to be a Winner and a  Loser.All the way from Australia. 😊
The bowling is terrible 😢 they don't have good bowlers.
I am still searching for the drama 😂
Harry brook the PSL product❤🔥
Andre Russell should never bowl the last over, he just can't. He is not a bowler for such times.
That's the product of PSL🔥🔥
Well played England team ❤
Wow enjoy    T20 match  West Indies..... 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Oh my goodness
Ben stoke revenge by hary brook
Super T20 Match, full of entertainment 👍
Roman Powell has been in a great form. Looking forward to see his sixes in psl 9🎉😮😎
West indies boller is worl every losser
Windies you are the best in t20! Always love to watch carribian!
There is legwan who only play leg side😂😂😂
Unfortunatly Phil  rubbed  SALT  into West indies  wounds. GREAT game from both sides, to bad there had to be a winner and a LOSER. All the way from Australia.  😀👍
Indeed, cricket is that game in which anything can happen 18 Ball 50 runs 😮 just wow
2016 to 2023
Kmt unno.lose the match ballers no good poor ball
What a disgusting bowling by WI and outstanding batting by Eng
Holder is past his sell by date
Oh, the Windies lost at the end because they didn't bowl well in the last 3 overs, this team was missing in CWC23.
Sad to say none of the windies seambowlers can bowl .. they all jus run in and put the ball down. No containment nor strategy to their armoury. So even if the team makes 300 it will still not be enough to defend 😢😢😢😢😢
England on fire 🎉
❤️
Very well played england...❤️😌 Pill salt,harry brook what a knock 😍❤️😎 Love from sri lanka ❤️
empty stadium
Commentator ♥️
Bad bowling by Wi.Not good batting by eng as wi bowlers bowl too many loose deliveries
Good comeback.
whata run cheese buy 😊❤England
Magnificent game❤
Hoooooooooo
What a match.. But no one is talk about this match cz they r not indian... If indian did this i don't know what will be happend today
I dint understand why the hell rovman powell dont use anyone else instead of russel he should have came himself even Rutherford bowls better he always play only with 5 bowlers
Don't write or indicate the result of the match through title or image of the clip please it takes the excitement away from the people who are watching for the first time
Holder Russel wtf r u doing there. Give chance to young guys.
🎉🎉
West Indian fast bowlers have no discipline at all😒💔
Two teams played their best game🎉🎉
Amazing cricket 🎉🎉 woooww..
Pure batting war...
Brook hits 4.43 runs per delivery. Amazing shot selection
Congratulations England team but west indies played well too 👍👍👏👏👏
Well done England ❤🎉
as salty as i may sound russell made harry brook look better than he is with that poor bowling at the end but well played england and salt for the 100runs
What a win england wow ❤❤
A great win by England but I still hate the 20 over slog game. Hitting more sixes than fours because the boundaries are too small. Just wham, bam thank you ma'am cricket. Quantity has replaced quality.
Also Credit goes to captain & coach brook comes to bat Ahead of Ali
What a match
The bowlers didn’t do there job
Taking single for century is not good decision where each ball requires 3 runs, selfish act from salt
Welcome back ENGLAND 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
West indies new players are playing better.
Harry brook ❤

🎉❤
Bad bowling for the final over!
World most unlucky Team is west Indies 💔
Buttler + Salt 🧂 + brook 😮😮😮❤
Its short boundaries that's why can't feel fun to view this kind of match. This is a plan to destroy cricket, Fans didn’t get interesting like before. When the ball flies got six not come into hand.
What a match 👀🔥💝
Love you allah❤❤
What a man ! BROOK ♥️♥️. well done love from Bangladesh
Need to replace MYERS🙌🏽
It took Harry brook only 5 balls to tell everyone that he is better than Ahmedabadi princess gill 😂😂😂
Fair play that was some run chase.
What a match!!!
awesome batting by both teams
Andre Russell has been bowling very poorly in this series.
england played very well ❤❤ but no one can match westindies❤
Nice match ❤dont worry windies ❤love from sri lanka
Superb come back Eng ❤
wow what a game
Remember the name harry brook
t20 successful purely just because of westindies❤❤❤ love from PAKISTAN❤❤
West Indies bowling was disgusting! How can you bowl like this after batting like that! This is sickening
Classic t20❤❤
Well played England 🎉
What a fastest bating from both sides we are enjoying ❤
England's comeback before the T20 world cup...
Most six than four just because not Yorkers only fulltoss.
Jos the boss
What a game..T20 at its best 🔥
What a game what a inning by Harry Brock
Wow England 🇧🇩🇬🇧🏏🏏
What a Match 🖤
Harry brook again given an audition before Ipl auction
We want Dre Russ back💥😢
What a game!
Why put Russell to bowl in this crucial time ? 😢 best put Kyle Meyers with less pace on the ball and swing , shm the bowlers gave it away 😢 . Better luck next time guys 😅
Harry brook ❤
Ladies &  Gentle man This is called T20 match Wow What a match. Brilliant
Harry  brook 7 ball to 31 run😱😱
Pl solt harry brook two best
Humongous run chase🎉
Congratulations England
Remember the name Harry  Brook
Those 2 Shots are Owesome smashed by Harry in Last Over! 🤤🔥 15:01
What a game played by Harry Brook 🔥😍
Salt ❤ brook
Congratulations
Remember JOFRA ARCHER 💀
Why the ground like this much small🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Sunrisers screwed up by releasing Harry Brook.
Russell should see a barber
West indies balling line bad
They add special scenarios to cricket Even if they loose- West indies are better than srilanka Bangladesh Ireland Netherlands Namibia Zimbabwe e
West indies captain should have given the last over to wicket keeper
Buttler is back ❤🎉
The barmy army
Carnage ❤️‍🔥
Batting of the highest quality from Salt and Brook❤ Never a fan of West Indies dearh bowling, they always either overpitch or bowl full tosses
Mind blowing game😱
West Indians worst team eva
Kyle mayers didn't chance to bowl... it's sorrowful 😔
West indie😂😂😂😂😅😅
This is what west indies needs, you can't win matches when 2 of your 5 main bowlers are allrounders. Bring in forde in place of joseph and 1 more bowler in place of holder
Welcome Powel to the Peshawar Zalmi
Wooww..Salt so power today
Question: I bowled during my whole life but remained as an average bowler. Who am I?  Answer: Andre Russell! 😅
This is the problem of WI balling. They have powerfull and talented batters. But they fail in their balling attack.
😭🖤
*What a match❤❤❤*
Good batting wicket, poor bowling from the West Indies, especially the last two overs, piss poor as we say in Barbados
Brilliant run chase from the 3 lions,salt 109no,Brook 31 no off 7,well deserved
Remarkable run chase ❤❤
Waht a game 😂😂😂
❤❤England Win.... imagine games 😊😮😮😮😮
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
love it good cricket😎
😮🔥
Outstanding batting display from both teams but, as an England fan, I thought England’s “pace” bowlers looked very pedestrian. Not that blistering pace is the be all and end all but when the line and length are also questionable, what else have you got?
Russell needs to get drop and play shepherd
RUSSEL GOT HIS OWN MEDICINE😅😅😅
Amazing finished
Wow
আসলেই এরাও পারে কিন্তু এদের সময়টা খারাপ গেছে এই বার
What a match. Both teams are played very well. Congratulations England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🔥
Superb game..and marvelous 😮
LICKS like PEAS.....LOL.....barmy army
super game
We've often seen that the no of sixes in WI inning is usually more than no of fours which is guite fantastic
Brooks bat like he taking a walk in the park, no sweats.
What a game 😅😅😅😅😅
what a match
What a game 😮❤️
this field short
Without harry brook match winning is not possible am i right?
Brook is next level 🔥
Congratulations England. Well played both teams
Please get holder out of here
What a game ❤❤❤
Eng
Harry Brook😮😮
my favourite T20 cricket team West Indies ❤❤❤ and my T20 favourite batsman Chris gel the universal Boss  all time fire ❤❤
West indies batting good. Boling wost
Game is the game.But final comentry from ion bishop sir.Its beautiful.
Real England is back ❤
video  no hd
Thanks for posting
What a game? Unbelievable England.
I'm in amaze of how they've allowed Russel to bowled the last over. The second t20 match he went for alot smh
Baler khela,,last over e eto run niye jai
Salt and Brook was "brutal"..💥what a top class Chase from the boys.. the Windies didn't see this tornado coming..🌪 442.85 Brook strike rate..😲
Wow that flick off his hip from Brook was just an extraordinary shot
Buttler at middle order-😪😪 Buttler at top order -🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
waO nice game
Brutal 🔥
None would have thought a baby faced batter could be this brutal..😮
Andre russel 😂 what’s up man?
Ian Bishop❤️🔥
Just when IPL auctions around the corner HB and PS did it.
West Indies fast bowlers need to bowl straight expensive overs caused too much SALT
Brook day remember ❤
West indies sold big time
Russel and holder. 👎 bad bowling
WHO IN THE WORLD Ask Russell to bowl last over. TRASH t20 Bowler. Joseph is another TRASH bowler. Bowl joseh within first 10 over, he cant handle pressure.
Salt 🧂 salt up de game to rass! 😂
Honestly Russelle needs to stop bowling
Wawoo ❤
Ek hamari team hy k ksm kayi howi hy k es tarah aggressive cricket kabhi nhi khelnge or na hi sixs marenge
Poor bowling by WI
West lndies has the weakest bowling attack in the two teams. England did their homework.
cricket is so much corrupted nowadays. it was a well planned script executed to the perfection. west indies board needs money they cannot afford two dead rubber matches if WI were to win this and take the series, so just gave england the WIN.
Harry brook on fire🔥🔥🔥
That’s all WI knows how to do now play foolish cricket when it comes to real cricket they r sh-t
Well done Salt and Brook. Those are some small boundaries.
Why did russel bowl the last over?😢
Brook 31 off 7. Eat that.
83 from 30 at one point 😂😂😂😂😂😂 thanks Alzari and Andre 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Phil salt is very very underrated cricketer. How Delhi capitals released a player like this???
Really
Harry 🔥🔥🔥❤️
Poor bowling unit WI
Very poor bowling from west indies
Hi i am from Pakistan 🇵🇰 can u please all support me i am waiting for u Plz
West Indies bowling was atrocious. They saw England going after almost everything and continued to bowl the same line or length. Hardly any variations.. Also the choice of bowlers to start was a huge loss too.
Best commentary ever 😍 💖 Voice like loin roar 🦁 Congratulations english team 🎊
Small ground
When I saw the number of misfilelds in the first 3 overs I know WI would lose, the lack of focus was evident. The team does not handle success well. Was good to see the batting click though, nice contributions throughout the order. But losing that way is embarrassing.
Harry Brook - had a few low scores BUT then he did this!! 🤩
WI have to improve in bowling, they have no proble with batting
Brook - Future Icon
So sad they highlighted west indies 6's and not england rubbing salt 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂in the wound
Harry brook ❤
What a game this was...... Absolutely  wonderful
The commentary is a masterpiece, its stupendous and world-class.
West indies Batting 🔥🔥 kn kn agree ha like kro or reply kro
WI batting lineup is brutal...... bowling was lacking today though. Good win for England
What a match!!!   Brook  Congratulations England
Well done 👍 congratulations 🎉🎉 good batting, both sides.hope for this type of performance in the next game.. bowler's has to step up.
Full tosses,   is it bent ?  CWI need a shilling or two,  apparently.
great game
Wow what a game
Why does it always comes down to not winning series decider and d bowling was horrible 🤔
this broke my heart😢😢 but brilliant batting diaplay from both teams hard luck russell but dont be discouraged its only your 3rd game back...
Russell no fi get the ball so late down ina the game
Rubbing Salt into the Wound Well done Poms, but watch out for both these teams at the T20 World Cup
This Harry Brook guy’s gonna be some batsmen.
Massive chase, very close at the finish, both teams playing their best. England may have won, but that West Indies side is dangerous
Absolutely brilliant sport
Very small ground😂😂
Love  west indies
If not better then at least twinning with the DK against Bangladesh inning
Di number 23 fi west indies me nuh member im name im fi go pon di bench two many change im get and nothing sameway smh
Waraaaa win this is something else dude 😂😂😂❤❤❤
Biff bash bollocks.
Jason holder bowl inn look poor poor
Andre Russell can sit out di next two im look tired
wow
Rubbish bowling by westindies....6.5 feet bowlers are unable to bowl above 130 speed....this team should lessen their practice....( hand practice )
Really good batting  But sucks to put up that score and lose
One of the greatest chases in the history of T20s considering the circumstances. England have been totally second best the entire tour, but today, they kicked some windies ass 😂
Well played England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 congratulations for the victory and making the series alive. Pure entertainment T20I at its very best.
Mayers needs the drop just like hetty if he’s bowling won’t be utilize it makes no sense he keeps failing. Today I thought the skipper could have use mayers or even himself or Rutherford to try something different the main bowlers got hammered all over the place. The batting was exceptional but the bowling was woeful. None of these bowlers tried wide Yorkers to force the batsmen to do things differently to many half volleys and full badly lined balls. Great cricket match for the Neutral still
❤❤❤
Congrats to england great game love it
Reconfigure and let's move forward
Great game but for some reason like our west Indian bowlers cannot bowl a Yorker in the depth overs. Great win England.
Andrea  Russell  wasn't  the man for the last over
Good game of cricket 🔥
Can't even fill their ground for a T20
Russell got the Stokes treatment 😂
One of the better T20Is out there of recent years, all in gorgeous West Indies scenery, greetings from N. Ireland & an excellent performance by both teams. brilliant chase by England to keep the series alive. Looking forward to the T20 World Cup next summer already.
Russel has been the match winning player with ball and bat for team WI in past. He used to be use variations and slow balls in past gives him lots of wickets at the crucial time but now-a-days, he is balling fast which is not working for him.
Good play by both teams ...hats 🧢 off to Phil salt and Harry brook at the end...
Ok from a WI fan point of view that was an awsome game from the English. And you'd have to come good on a series decider to overhaul 200+ runs. They played like west Indies but with one difference, they kept wickets in hand.
What a great match.. Harry brook and Salt  These two will make good money in the upcoming IPL auction
As a West Indies fan, honestly I am disappointed that the results placed us on the wrong side of the fence, it reminds of that ODI match when Gayle and Butler were ruthless, then only to see England winning. However, this is a match where I could say the guys gave their best by fighting for the badge,  thus it was a super effort. Sad to say, but this match is surely one for history where the highlights will be showing almost every time.
One word for commentary "masterpiece"
Surprising how both teams hit more sixes than fours. West indies has always been a thriller to the t20s🔥
WI should include Sunil Narine or Rakheem cornwall
Why not jason roy
Windies look great again good to drop Hatymayer, think to drop Russell please 🥺
West Indies need to fix their bowling line up. Its a team effort that win games not just batting.
Lucky win for England, west indies still going to demolish them in this series.
They’re going to get toweled up in the Tests Down Under the Windies but I hope to god they find some sort of fighting  Cricket needs a strong WI test side.
Russel is not a crunch time bowler, West Indies need to learn that
Lollipop  bowling by West Indies as Jeffrey Boycott would have said
Kyle needs to be replaced too just like hetmyer
Russel made england win 😂😂
Dre russ n Joseph are getting too expensive their leaking too much runs you can have Dre russ bowl the last over that's a stupid   decision by Powell I think they should replace Joseph n put in forde
What these people are doing with hitmayer he is a waste
That was ASSalt and battery! 🙃
West indies  selector  and captain  needs to use their brain Russell  Holder And Joseph  are very expensive  why play the three  ,Take too long for our selectors to know that slow bowlers  or more effective  in the t20 format and the pitches  out here.why not myers bowled  a over or two .Captain u use to bowl good medium  pace how comes u just leave the most expensive  bowler to bowl the last over
I support west indies team. See you next game
Brook nailed it😮
Wow
As a west Indian I say kudos to England on dis victory
Just goes to show how important Buttler is to the cause. If he lands his blows, every player starts clicking.  I really think it's time to rest Tymal Mills though 😂
HARRY BROOK U BEAUTY ❤
Harry brook Lahore qalandar sunshine
Why are the boundaries in so much.??!.. push it out a bit. So boring to see so many sixes. Make it a bit more fun and balanced
Bro those sixes!!
What kind shit is this W .I. always have to make the other team look good ....
Joseph needs to address his poor bowling.
Good game, but real face will be shown when the WI Team would play in big ground such as Australia or India has. This Game was in favor of both Teams.
I love West Indies team ❤
Remarkable Runchase Highest vs west indies Salt butler and brook on fire 🔥 very well played congrats 🎉❤
Garbage bowling west Indies from all rounders😴
BTW , ADIL RASHID STILL ONE OF MOST UNDERRATED LEG-SPINER  ACCORDING TO ME
Russell needs to stop bowling the last over. He is cannon fodder. Well played WI despite the loss. I do t mind losing if the team goes out there and plays with pride and fight.
Class commentry by Ian Bishop. No bias towards his home team, unlike Indian commentators. Plus, Indian commentators just keep screaming"Oooo, Oooo"😡
Salt on Fire 🔥 well played England 🎉 congrats loVe 🎉❤
Better bowling effort and we would have won quite easily.
I always  say this stop the damn  short bowling you bunch of fools  damn
Good inning by salt but west indies is back
Congratulated England Love From Bangladesh Sylhet 🇧🇩
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOK!
Phil Salt in with a blinder and Brook with that almost Rinku-esque save at the end was the stuff of legends
Unbelievable 👏🔥
Gotta suck to not be able to defend such high runs
Why us Russell still playing. He's finished
It looks like WI listened to user feedback and decided not to reveal the winner in the titles anymore ❤
West indies if allyuh make me waste my money in Trinidad eh
Just got brilliant thanks
Russel🤧🤧
We all have surely seen Windies baters have played some great innings but nothing at all from bowlers in last 5 years
Tough loss WI. Good team effort. Brilliant batting. I think we bowled a bit too short at times on a small field. Hoping for a better performance next game.
well played England
West Indies bowling is awful after the time of Ryan king and dillon. After that no big name. Their hitting has gone more and more batter each day but their bowling esp fast bowlers are history now. BIG, TALL AND STRONG GUYS BUT no pace and aggression.
What a game ❤
What a game... And open series... Looking forward to the final games !
Just loving the come back of black storm 🖤
Why have Dre Russell to bowl final over??? Smh...
West Indies ❤
What a game this hat's off to Harry Brook, rated him highly ever since saw him at Lahore smashing 100 in PSL and he's proving just that
Congratulations 🎉🇵🇰
Love West Indies team love you all ❤❤❤
