Not Bass
Found this video somehow more relatable and likeable than past ones despite already enjoying ur content - i just subbed... but... tbh i dont think being youtuber is healthy. Focusing on viewcount etc... carrier isnt importante. stay healthy slapper. Youre a fascinating and interesting person <3
F
Daviewdiepie  lite...
f
can we  all congratulate davie  cuz he got married
Your real self is amazing. Much respect. And I won't be scared even if you improve your camera quality. Real slappers are already used to your face

OMG!!!  I have never felt like this before while  watching davie s videos , why is this video so emotional i am very sad now idk why. Has anyone felt that or am i the only one who feels this ahh!!! EMOTIONAL TIMES
F
Davie: I haven’t run out of ideas Davie: stops making full length videos and relies on little dancing stuffed cactuses for views
WhErE yOu GonNa Be In tHe neXT fivE yeARS?!
Wow imagine being 6ft7 and weighing 66Kgs

i've been subscribed for only 2 months now. Usually I do not watch your video's immediately when you post them but later when it's a better time for me. I'm trying to say that numbers are deceiving, I really appreciate the choices you make in making your content and I love the way you show who you are between the lines. Stay gold!
i loviu david, saludos desde
It's  1000000% cool beard.
Loved it
Great.
glad u always shave
F
As you're (supposedly) italian, this should be moustache reveal
beard suits you
Italian government must give u some award or medal for the being the least emotional Italian
We are usually our worst critic. You have good ideas and good music. So , SLAP Like to yourself now! 😊
Which is the name of the song?
F.   R.i.p beard
OMG F
F
You look awesome with beard!
F-
f
F
i have never seen davie with a beard before.
In youtube you have a loyal, old fanbase. In tik tok you have millions of genZ doing nothing but watching random videos in chain day after day.
didnt know sorathetroll was one of your qna
Ok I like the beard look
I just looked up your height. Come to the Netherlands you'll fit right in.
F
noice beard, so badass
Sora the troll has been in the video. Me = happi
Inspired me to buy a BASS! Just got one, just need to learn how to play like you…one day 🤙🏽
I like you Davie!
Dude... u look really good in beard!... keep it pls
Beard? Approved!
Grow the beard again, it suits you.
Ff
F to beard
Holy shit you can grow a beard.
love u davie :-) best youtuber ever
f
Lol, I love the emotional music to make every word seem deep. Except every word is deep, deep in bass.
a lot better withthe beard
Yes on the beard. Very stylish. But it sounds different when slapping a shaved face I guess.
Davie looks pretty forking good with his beard
That's not Justin beiber
Amazing facts about Davie504: 1. Plays Epic BASS 2. Plays Pokémon Go .. keep slapping and  we'll keep watching! .... p.s. Would love to add you on Pokémon Go.
F
The man can slap bass, he has a great sense of humor AND he can rock a beard!! It looks good on ya Davie!!
The beard is HOT at that length but don't do a ZZ Top thing...... BTW  I cant even think of ZzTops bass lines because I hate them.
It's crooked
NoShavie504
GROW THE BEARDDDDD
OMG, you call this a beard?? Pfff- not epic
I slap like for 69420 times with beard
Davie is so funny it is so relaxed that it seems natural
6'7"? No wonder you play bass so well. You got massive hands! My tiny hands made it way too hard to play the guitar but was easier for me to pick up the ukulele. Epico.
No slappers in this video..I'm leaving
Davie inspired me to start playing bas!
F u look good with beard
This was the best non bass video I’ve seen yet. The “real” you is far more interesting. The pure character version lacks depth after a while.    This was a nice change of pace.
Don’t think you look older with the beard. Kids thought you looked healthier too. Maybe it’s the contrast🤷‍♂️.
So pumped for chess 2
The numbers on YouTube and tik tok are manufactured.   some are real followers and views but all are not.  Lady gaga videos on YouTube dont start at view 1 they start at 3 million views to herd the sheep and curate the content they want promoted.
Is your MBTI:BASS?
I bought a bass, noodled around for a bit, and then sold it again. Davie504 makes me want to buy another bass.
F
That emotional music part cracked me up 😂
F
"Use your mouth" AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
I'm a Guitarist and your videos have inspired me to start playing Bass
Can you play fretless bass in one of your vids?
F
Slappeh
You look babass though, with that beard.
3:15 hahah at least 3 I will say! I am looking for a bass right now since I sold my old one.. sad times.. :'(
Can't wait for Chess 2...crying, just crying.  Great video all around with so many funny jokes.  Deciding to be Italian.  But Chess 2, ROTHF!!!!
I'm asking a question Davie504 from the past. 4 months in the past Do I have Davie504's permission to buy 🅱️ass So I can learn 🅱️ass And slap the 🅱️ass
3:12 now that's a face reveal!
I want to slapp chess with Davie504
Algorithm indeed. I haven't seen a Davie504 video on my feed for ages. I just went to take a look why and this is one of the videos I clicked on.
I actually liked the beard.
Dude. I love you man. You're the best. Supporting musicians in a unique and effective way, that you designed yourself? Amazing. You're a unicorn 🦄
"Can't wait for Chess 2" had me dying 🤣
this came out on my 21st birthday. thanks davie
f
Where do you see yourself in five years? Davie: Dead 😐  (I spilled my drink)
Beard-> Approved
“Davie504 with a beard can’t hurt you” **Davie504 with a beard**
Love the beard
That's a cool experiment of the YouTube algorithm. Makes me more confused though haha
F
Keep beard
Davie504: world tour reveal
You're awesome bro! Keep up the good work! Cheers from Brazil 👍
thank you for the slap man.
Just saying... I am watching your channel
9.98 Come on baby!
Where do you play live, Davie? Do you have any videos of you playing live... some where?
Sei un grande ti LoVVo anche se suono Sinths & Drums 🇮🇹😀❤️
"Let's start with this relaxing C&A" *Intense Shaking Reverb Davie:* *"FIRST QUESTION"*
You are one of a kind my dude can't wait to see the next videos@_@ 😆👍🙏

i love u so much davide
Davie504, when you slap bass, does it hurt? :(

I know some good bass players here in down under that could beat you. interested  ??????
If it helps from a viewer perspective, I'm subbed to over 200 channels and I couldn't tell you at this point who I'm subbed to.  The big issue is videos from my subs don't show up on my main YouTube page where I usually riff from.  I don't see your videos and I'm bombarded with so much other content that I forget about my other subs.  Then I finally get a video from you 6 months later (likely from a Mr. Beast link b/c it gave me your TeamSeas video) and I can catch up on your videos.    Maybe YouTube should add a big section of videos exclusively from your sub list or split the screen so you see non-sub on one side and subs on the other.
I have watched a few a your videos. I just discovered this channel a few days ago. One question: "should I subscribe? NOW?
I found you bc I was watching "dark web" videos and you had one that popped up. That was last week and I've been hooked ever since! ❤
F
f
You should take four months off a year like normal TV production
LoL sora the troll commented
Bonna sera senior Davie cnelentano super musicant coza nostra music 🎶🎵 bas guitarist fantastic coza nostra grass is komentari

Waiting for chess 2 as well
BASS BEARD
Usd dollars 😂 Still makes me laugh after all this time lol
what are your thoughts on stuart hamm? he gave me the love of bass and to see this newer generation mixing him with les claypool i give many props to
Very nice and candid video. I also applaud your editing skills & humor!
DAVIE, The unshaven face looks really good on you bud. 👍👍👍 OMG, VERY IMPRESSIVE. Don't worry you're doing awesome. 10,000,000 subs will come my friend. Would you ever teach anyone BASS? If they were passionate about it and dedicated? EPIC. I love you man, you're awesome and a huge inspiration. From the bottom of my heart, "Thank you for all that you do for us Davie".
This video is missing O.M.G. at the end. I’m very dissatisfied. 😤
F
noice beard
The beard is perfect!
E
love you bro
F
F
I was looking for super small musicians with no views when I found you. I shook my head cause when I searched for small channels your channel with 10m subs popped up. Luckily you’re absolutely amazing and you’re now my favorite channel but YouTube really is a mess. So many people just don’t have a chance and it’s hard to understand why.
You're our Justin Bieber ! 😉👍 🥰
BARBA!
When are you going to marry, Davie?
No offense man, but how the hell did you get almost 10 mil subs?
Damn davie, i don't like beards at all but YOU LOOK SO HOT WITH A BEARD 🥵🤯
F
Play the bass with a bass 🐟
dave your're looking like "Dynamo"
F
f
Cyka blin
yo not gunna lie Davie looks good in a beard
He said "Hi" instead of "Whatsup, SLAPPERS"! This is NOT Davie 504. This is a clone. :))
Do be slapping like tho
Have you ever practiced Taijiquan or Qigong in Taiwan? There are a lot of good masters there
Shavie504
Tiktok makes more views because they want content creators to join the platform. YouTube is already established as the leader. They don't give a damn. :) Take a vacation, bro. And keep bringing the power of slap to the world.
Q&A achievement in great style! Surreal answers to pointless questions.
F
I will buy a ticket for the world tour
f
I have to accept that this one was an emotional video. I feel you like a friend, bro
Leave your beard dont shave it its fit you
PFFFFTTTJ:ELWKJTRIO  i just spit on my keyboard "i cant wait for Chess 2"  WTF lkjfa;lkjsdpfioaj hahaha
the beard really defines the jawline in a good way
davie do you know how to dunk in basquet ???
LOVE THE BEARD!!!       CHECKMATE
Davie504 please try a video at 60fps or even higher, would be nice, slapping in 60fps BASS!!!
Bad helth.
Holy shit! you are 6'7'' Wow! with that knowledge your hands dont look as big as I would imagine a person of your size to have
Best quote. "...or play video games such as Chess. Best video game of all times. Can't wait for Chess 2"        lmfao
A video w/o bass! Why did I watch it?
Pokémon trainer code reveal!!!!!!!!!!!!
I saw you long ago because of TwosetViolin, I didn't subscribe your channel though I was so amazed when I saw your playing with Twosets (I'm playing violin and piano only). Two days ago I saw your video again, you played with your girlfriend such beautiful and harmony. And what a surprise you showed your guts and dared to say Taiwan is a country. Because of that, I would love to watch your videos and be one of your fans. Please stay healthy and play more. A new fan of yours in Taipei Taiwan. By the way, I always love bass more than guitar.
Chess 2 😂
beards great
beard 504
Davie504.....can you play....'doremon' on bass🎸....😅😅
Cool 👍real 🇮🇹Italians
Ora ti mancano solo i video all'aperto!

I love the beard!!!!  My whole family loves what you do!  We wish you the best of what life has to offer!
keep beard
Did you ever accidentally slapped your camera while saying "stay funky bros"?
you look kinda weird with a beard lol but chill video
Please make a video of you getting a crappy bass from a pawn shop, and then fixing it up, by oiling fret board, setting action, installing new pure nickle strings, intonation , neck relief, redoing pickups and electronics.
Why do you talk like a robot?
Keep the beard, real jazz musicians have beards.
I like the beard
F
Well, why not start a band? That’s a thang.

DID YOU CAME TO CHILE???!!?! AND I LOST IT Im cutting my right testicle right noe
Well, with a beard you looks like in your mid thirties... without you looks like a 90yrs old with some photoshop tricks on ;)
stay funky pal
I was inspired to learn bass by watching your videos davie been going at it 4 months everday now. Thanks so much
Ayo these bots outta control
F
I hear Chess 2 will have Bass in it.
f :3
Grande Davide, finalmente ho capito il tuo NName: 504 significa 5 aprile, la tua data di nascita! Really appreciate this video!! Un caro saluto dalla Svizzera italiana: Luca ❤️
f
Such a troll, making people think you have bass cancer and you don't, you're well you liar, no bass cancer!
there's so much content online this days, that it's pretty impossible to keep up with all the people you follow over different platforms. stay funky fratello!
If he keeps a beard we will have an Italian pewdiepie
F

It's like bald Michael but switched.

f in the chat
Beard looks good tho
Every Italian girl knees become weak with bearded Davie504
so i work at a guitar shop in new USA new Mexico and for almost two year nobody had signed up for bass lesson but in the last few years we have gotten hundreds of new bass players some saying YouTube inspired them. and i may have picked up a bass of my own. keep up the good work and stay healthy
Freddie Mercury Italian
i actually enjoy Davie with a beard, it's very fitting
Keep the beard!
F
I think you should start a new project! I've been a sub for a long time, and yes, I now own a bass and actually play with my church. I saw a comment about starting a new channel for teaching bass, but I would say it'd be fine to just add a short introductory series to techniques and such. I wanna learn to slap like Davie! And solo, walk, comp, etc!
Hey man, don't mean to bug or add to a pile of other people's comments. I really like these types of vids for how honest they are or at least as much as they can be. I just want to say that a lot of last year was hard (Had to get a pacemaker lol) and I did feel some what lost. I used to be a sculptor years ago and I got back to after the surgery, but getting me through the problems would have been much worse without your content. Just know you help people man, so stay funky too. :
f
gotta admit I only subscribed a few days ago and i don't even play bass (but i'm a drummer so we can still be best friends) but i have watched soo many of your videos in those few days :D :D i think i am addicted now!
I'm the anti hero who would occasionally watch and not subscribe, but the sad piano music made me slap like and subscribe button. Bass is p good too ig, anime omegal was good video
Are you a Juventus fan? I love that team, MY team though, ARE RANGERS F. C.                                                CHAMPIONS!
That video was so good, knowing more about Davie504 was EPIC!!
Pizza
You've made me want to be better as a bass player.
<3
You inspired me to play bass.    Thank you Davie504 :)
F
Your best SUPER satire...Uhh...I shouldn't have said that...
bass fire tho
I SLAPPED LIKE ON THE BEARD VIDEO, AND I HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRAG ABOUT IT!!!
I'd wager Davide is about 2m tall. Just a guess.

I just watch your videos because I like you and appreciate that you are adding something good to the world. Your musical talent is amazing and shows that you worked at it and love it. Thanks for sharing yourself like this, and stay healthy.
Will your nose scar ever go away?
I pressed F in the comments. It autocorrected to a word that starts with F and ends with K.  Yes, Firetruck. What did you think it said??? Pst...  Love your stuff, Davie505. These Q&A videos could be more often, shows off your comedic mind!!
Nice mustache
4:15 We live Inasociety...
Farai mai un video senza tagli ?  . . . . . . .
I just found your channel about a week ago and have binged a ton of vids since then. Loving the content man, but do what makes you happy!
the algorithm never shows me davies vids anymore, i had to come here manually, my recommended is almost all stuff i have see before...
want to see this in 4K? I laughed real good at that one. I haven't upgraded either.
Scruff looks good on you
f in the chad
Hey davie I love your videos they make me laugh I want to be as good as you some day and I just want to say I hope ur ok and have a great rest of your day<3

f bald davie>beard davie
This was one of my favorites. You're a smart dude and a good guy. My kids now think the fact that I play bass I cool because we watch your videos in the car. (Well, they watch, i listen because i have to watch the road)
F
Mr. Slapper you made my day and be well
Wow you look similar to David Blaine with the facial hair.. lol.... kinda cute ;)
Wooo, what's your nickname in Pokemon GO :o?
Love the beard
@Davie504 Bro, I love you... Go to a TRT clinic, get your blood-levels checked, and I'm 99% certain you will find deficiency in various vitamins, and likely lower testosterone and IGF-1 levels. Not saying anything... But, you are not a teenager anymore. And these things are VERY common and often unaddressed by men. Don't have an ego about this. TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy) is shown reduce ALL causes of mortality. Do yourself a favor and go see the doc.
jabari
I love the Evil Beard! Slapped the like button!
Get well dude, you look like italian gangsta in the second part of the movie when he betrayed by friends drinking a lot and preparing for revenge )
Keep the beard
F

not one mention of "slap bass" ? I'm gonna faint
1 min into the video. You should keep the beard like that. Looks really good on you!
beautiful
Mental health problems, come on Daviexbe happy
Is that your real beard or are you using a beard stand-in?
Shavie504
I've been subbed for a long time and now I realized I stopped getting recommended your vids a while back. It's like if I skip 2 or 3 of your vids, your channel sinks to the bottom of my subbed list. Youtube's janky.
Shavie504
I don't play any music these days but I still love your videos and your dry sense of humor and deadpan delivery. Keep it up bro. I'll throw you a sub just to get closer to that 10M.
No offense but is this guy a better comedian then a bass player? not that he's bad at the bass, but he's so funny xDD
So it comes out. Davie504 is just a normal bass player who wants to make a living playing it..... I'm disappointed.
"I can't wait for chess 2"
I heard they're gonna release a DLC for Chess before Chess 2! It's gonna be called ''Chess 1: Pay To Win''

Tieni la barba  ciao
why don't you start reacting to some local music? since you react a lot =)
Honest, never got into bass or tried it properly. A guitar player, so unsacred, coming to bass videos. Sorry if that dissapoints you but I like listening along and seeing all the bass going on.

Mic reveal at 10m!
Fan: OFFICER, THAT MAN JUST SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE! Officer: Really? Who was it? Fan: Davie504 Officer: HAHA, real funny. Stop wasting my time, kid.
I really appreciate your videos. My friends and I are all musicians in Louisiana, who found you during quarantine in 2020. We watched most of your content over the course of a few weeks. You helped us to laugh, find other musicians who we learned to love, and we all liked and subscribed from then on. You helped us, and I'm sure many others with your reality, truth, the hope you inspire, and the entertainment you bring forth. We continue to share your videos, laugh and enjoy the new content just as much as we always have. I really hope you find some peace. You're a great, deep minded, intelligent guy, and if you did need a break, we would be here eagerly awaiting your return, respectfully. Thank you for being the man you are, you're an inspiration.
I don’t know who that was, but it wasn’t a pic of Justin Beiber…
That beard slaps
"can't wait for Chess 2" LOOOOOOL
Dave, you inspired me to pick up the bass, then I got scared and put it down again...please don't slap me!
F
Ffffffffffftffttfffffffffff
Chess 2 gonna be lit
Man keep that sweet beard!

This is the first davie504 vid I’ve seen on page in a year and I’ve been subscribed like wtf
You are Yin Sanpaku. This is when, if you look at someone's eyes at the same level as yourself, you can see white under the iris. This represents physical imbalance in the body and is claimed to be present in alcoholics, drug addicts and people who over-consume sugar or grain. Bass guitar is not mentioned.
please, play some samba slapping the bass
We want to follow you from pimples to bright white hair. Got it?

Stay healthy bro! I am one of those subscribers that don't come so often to watch the videos, but I'm here for this one and I really like your videos. It's just that I'm really busy and sometimes I'm not really up to watch anything. But I hope youtube will be a better place in the future. Stay funky bro!
Press F to pay respects for the beard
i very rarely comment on anything, but I'm the same age as you and i grew up watching your playing for technique and correct tabbing, our sense of humor hasn't grown the same but i still watch you because you are an honest person who truly loves our trade and i never stop learning from you. sorry to say I'm a pick player because of muscle issues but I'm considered the best bassist in my town. sorry to commit sacrilege. never stop Davie, you'd be amazing in a band but instead you inspire many of us to start our own, and show that bass doesn't follow everyone else in the ensemble.
F
You look realy good with beard
F
F
Didn't even notice the music until Davie mentioned it, was just too busy swooning over his beard I guess

Incredible
The video quality is completely fine. I don’t even have the bandwidth to play it even if you do film in 4K and I bet many people are the same. What bullshit lol. Maybe you’ll need it if you tried out Korean make up routine for a video lol. That would be funny. Thanks for liking my country :)
justin mendez
You need muscles to carry bass amps.
I've been playing bass for about 3 weeks now and have just discovered your channel. Your videos are amazing, your bass playing is incredible and you are constantly making me laugh. Keep it up slapper

When you pump weights, think of Frank Zane.
Why is Stallone doing bass videos on youtube?
Davie likes playing games. Next he becomes a sensation on Twitch 🇦🇺

You are funny, talented, and extremely entertaining! You are amazing !!!!!

There's just too much shit on youtube to watch everything I'm subbed to. That could be a reason for the 90%.
Hey man any chance you could do a yyz cover video ? I wanna hear and see you play some geddy man you’re an amazing bass player🤘🏼
Great Q&A Davie Hope to see you at Sangah Noona's channel soon!!

Don't stress too much bro, stay safe.. hugs from a stranger♥️

Nice Beard Like 😁👌👍
My 6'6" self watching the video. Chuckled at the "You're so tall bit". Figured you were a little shorter than me. Davie504: I'm 6'7" Me: Well, s**t.   ;-)

4:20 deym its the weeb
why bassist get more laid than other members of band? along with drummer
Why your gf is so small? lol she looks like 5.0´´
Wow that’s actually really weird, I honestly just thought you took a break from YouTube. When you pointed it out, I’m subscribed and I haven’t been seeing your videos recommended to me for awhile :/
Davie, great video. Please keep it up... I really appreciate your brand of humour, and the bass playing is brilliant. Thanks for the entertainment.
Not gonna lie Davie looks like bearded martin garrix
Chess elo reveal?
I'm actually worried. This sounds like deep depression. I know that youtube can be cruel sometimes, but it's not something to be stressed about se much
This video hits different from childhood reveal man so emotional or maybe not or is it just me hehe nice berd
Ngl, the beard lookin kinda great
You just need some chicken soup and a good SLAP!
As a person who has tried to get street cred, but frankly, who has not worked nearly hard enough to warrant the cred, I have finally decided to just bloom where I'm planted. But in my case, it took a severe health problem at age 50 to cause me to realize that life does not come to me, like I thought would happen. So I made a commitment to work harder at stuff. And I have found that the harder I work, the luckier I get.  That said, you clearly work really, really hard! And it shows. And we the viewing public are better for it. I have learned a number of cool things from you and your channel over the last year or so when I found your channel. (But frankly, I do not desire to see your "pee-pee," or your nakedness. Ever. I come for the bass. :-) But it's your channel, your life, your brand of humor, so in the end, I can just scroll on or whatever -- that's on me.)  In conclusion, I have also learned to develop thicker skin. I have been on FB since roughly 2008. I have gained friends whom I have never met personally, and I have lost good friends whom I've known for 30+ years -- at least online. My wife is the one who looks at the number of friends I have -- I honestly can't tell you what that number is, because I look at it only once a year, if even that. I put my thoughts and feelings online, and if people are good with that, cool. If not, there's the "unfriend" button. Whatever.  I would rather see one video a week from you, than two or three, and you burn out. No reason for that. You will still be popular -- and maybe even moreso, because you are taking care of yourself. Don't let the whiners get you down, but don't cave in to public demands, either. We can't please everybody.  Be well, and be at peace, Davie504! Greetings from the USA.
hey
F for Davie's beard.  And, I'd love some tutorials or stuff like that, maybe in a secondary channel, just to not keep messing with the almighty YouTube Algorithm

Hey Davie, what do you think of mandolin?
6 feet 7 for real?? 😧
*HEALTH* me

F.  but really Davie, I love each one of your videos and I feel bad if I miss one! You've inspired me to pick the bass again.
pfft. Tetris > Chess.
Ok therapy time!
I feel bullied because as a bed room nerd guitarist I always look at the bass as a very chad looking instrument... Now even the god of slap bass looks more chadler than ever
Por fin mis comentarios de que te dejaras la barba se hicieron realidad 😎
9,69M subs 😏
I forget that a lot of us Italians grow facial hair in what feels like hours😂
F for davie's beard, it was a short journey, but it was a happy one.
"Bass videos are short videos so they have less watch time." That's why you need to make more hour long bass-playing-only videos. We must believe in BASS.
Chess 2!?!?!
You are at 9.69 subscribers. I will do what's necessary and not subscribe

I think the beard looks good
Davie504, thank you for videos like these... really love them... I don't use that word much, only when its really felt.... these videos let us know that you are a real human, a true human!! Your story is awesome... your humbleness is touching... and your bass playing has actually gotten me to think about learning the BASS.... and your epic original bass rifts are the reason... keep it up... and thank you!! I have to do this though.... no apologizes....  SLAP....  Had to slap you back because your bass playing has really slapped me in a deep way... SLAP... and that one is just because that's how I am... lol...
This new real personality reveal made me tear up a little bit to be honest, I have been following you for a while now, I think I subscribed in 2017 and you were one of the main reasons I started playing bass, and to be honest I didnt watched a lot of your videos in this current year, but this qna reminded me how much you helped me out through hard times, and now that im having a hard time again, you are still there helping me out. I just wanted you to know that there's ppl out there that truly enjoy your content and that you truly inspire. Subscribing to this chanel was one of the best decisions I've ever made. 504 4life

DISLIKE NOW! So you can be proud on the first and only bearded video of Davie504.69
Davie, i will not slap like button ever again if you don't keep your beard like this.
I'm happy to be a fan of this man
F
I don't watch every video because I'm not always motivated, or happy.  When I watch your videos again, or Andrew Huang's, or Red Means Recording, it's usually when I want to be happy, though. I want to be motivated.   But knowing I'll never make good content like yours makes me a bit sad, and so I avoid the channels to avoid being too sad
Ngl you look like an abusive alcoholic in the thumbnail
I Will always be here. You're fantastic and i love every video you upload. Send you a hugh and saludos from México!
I thought the beard would look bad on you, but actually you look bad on the beard.
f
F
You could start a series where you play a bass cover of famous pop hits and make a fun but quick tutorial on how to play them. Something like Umbrella by Rihanna on bass and things of that sort. This could help a larger number of common people get more in touch with musical knowledge; stimulate their interest in the art of music. Good old rock and metal classics are already well-covered (literally), have done and still do a great favor for beginning and aspiring musicians of all backgrounds, and everyone knows how to play them. If a popular and influential musician like yourself could do the same with iconic pop hits (the fans of which mostly have no idea how to play them, despite loving them with their heart), this could be revolutionary. It could bring a whole new and wider public to your channel and get you to 10 million subs faster.

What?! Helth video???

I need to totally agree on YouTube algorithm thing. I watch a lot of videos on yt and it feels like the feed is shit. Your videos almost never appear on my feed which is super strange. I wish you a good luck and an energy to keep going :) maybe someday they will actually fix it.
3:51 That smile. That damned smile
F in the chat
No one cares… 🖕🏻
I loved this Video
I bought a bass some months ago and I have not regreted. Thanks you Davie for inspiring me to slap the bass <3
Actually, you are one of the few people I've seen that can totally rock a no-shave beard, man. You should keep it
Do not stress David, it is the youtube algorithm, it drove many youtubers crazy
i love the beard
.
You look much better with the beard imo.
It's great that Davie picked up weightlifting. Health is indeed very important. I started exercising regularly when the pandemic started and I have never gotten sick since
The little laugh after "i don't feel too good, obviously" was so great.
Stay funky davie. The subs will come in time. Gotta just chill and ride the YouTube algorithm wave
Country of origin revel at 10M subs! liver reveal at 10.5Msubs! inside of my nose reveal at 10.7M subs!

You're taller than Bo Burnham
Personally I think the beard looks great but it needs some blonde, SDAIAY with blonde beard....
I have covid
Maaaan, you made a youtube channel that is based on non mainstream music and you've got 9 million people. YOU ARE A BEAST! Cheers from Argentina, arriba! un abrazo!
Don't be hatin on the man's camera!
Nice beard.
davie looks good with a beard tbh
Do a Pedal review.  I challenge you to try to sound like Royal Blood
F
My honest answer to why I stopped watching your videos is that the general feel of the videos and the "character" davie504 got old (to me personally). You just mentioned in this video that the same 69-jokes and memes got old in sdayai, which made me think you maybe think so yourself as well. There have been some great ideas, for example the collabs with other musicians and the hiring of musicians to try to match your "impossible" solo (just to name a few), but it's all in the same packaging.  There are countless sound and visual effects in your videos, very fast paced editing, and you have kinda created a "language" for yourself, with the "omg"s, the 69s and lots of others. You have a distinct style. At first I thought it was fresh and entertaining, but after like 30-40 videos I kinda knew what to expect. After this point, I slowly stopped watching, because I felt your videos gradually turned into one video, so to speak, and there was little new to be found.   I'm sorry, I don't want anyone to feel bad, but that's my honest reason. Might be just my opinion, but if it isn't just me, maybe it can be of some help. You're a good guy, davie.
please tell me i'm not the only one who realized JUST now during this video, that 504 stands for his birthday hahahah (5.04)

man, you're amazing. ♥

I actually like these kind of honest videos from Davie....
You give new meaning to slap happy.  Sorry for being the sub that doesn't watch all your videos, too much content for me already.   I did watch the short, but I don't use YouTube to watch shorts typically.  I saw that one randomly.
The non shave looks good funky bro
I need Davie504 as a friend on PoGo so we can slap raid bosses together.

I genuinely like and support this man. He is the reason I bought a B A S S. I would really appreciate it if he would play twenty one pilots songs on the B A S S like Jumpsuit
Looking more Italian than ever reveal

Have a breake dude, we are not going anywhere.
If you need a video idea: you could play more anime openings :)
hairy
About the subscribers' problem and the video on TikTok with much more views than the one on YouTube, the reason is just the duration of videos. Usually, one person is subscribed to many channels on YouTube, but it's impossible to watch every video of every channel, because many channels have very long videos. So, you receive a notification that someone has put out a new video, and even if you don't know the length you assume that it could be long and you think: "I don't have time now,". On TikTok, you KNOW that the video is going to be VERY short and so you watch it and if you like it you share it with your friends knowing that a lot of them will watch it because it's soo short. This way, numbers grow up quickly. You really can't compare YouTube and TikTok views.
What if you play bass in the background of an entire video and add a bass cam? It would be an excuse to still make “bass” videos that are long while still being a “bass” video.
Guitarist/Drummer here (nothing serious)... picked up a bass after watching your videos and now I'm learning it. I'm glad to have found this channel and I happily subscribed. 😁
F
You look cool
Semi Beard looks great!
The gameplays aren't a bad idea Davie

the fans who still watch videos watch them for you not necessarily the video itself. Davie cannot die
F
GET A BEARD Edit: Damn he really does look older than he is. thought he was 35
Besides all the fun, jokes and showing off your superb skills, I would love you starting a sub channel where you would explain various techniques like plucking, slapping, etc to bass players that have picked up their first bass and try to get the hang of it. I do believe you would be a great online teacher and could help people out there to learn and master the bass. Maybe it is time to move into a new direction and transmit your knowledge to the army of slappers out there :).
Even if portraying your character, we can see a bit more of yourself in this video, which is really great. It's sad that Youtube's system of promotion makes creators downgrade their content so much. I hope you get better.
Ehi tu bravo suonatore di basso..dato che sei un tipo cazzuto, perché non fai l'audizione per sostituire Lexxi Fox negli Steel Panther?!
F
Love u Davie Gonna watch more of u upload soon

Hey Davie I was watching on my tv and had to log in with my phone to comment on how good you look with a beard. Wait 4 months, if after that you still hate it. Shave it.. if not keep it. Lets not make hasty decisions…
you like vietnam?
shave your beard

Just like with Linus from Linus Tech Tips, I think you look better with the beard

The most EPICO beard!
FARGAN????????
grow that beard man
Davie, I watch and like every single one of your videos. I wish I could subscribe again and again and it counted. You're on my top 5 favorite youtube channels. Thank you. Never stop doing what you're doing, and never quit slapping the bass.  Also, I want another 1 hour Bassline video, even if it's just well looped. I wanna listen to it while I'm gaming. Thank you :V
Are you really 6'7?
f
F
Sei Italiano you italy
You look like kenny s
Well Done Davie, Relax ! If you don't feel like shaving , don't. If you're not 'feeling' the video, don't. You've earned respect. With whiskers , wrinkled T Shirt..etc., an artist can cover Led Zep or D Purple, with an old P Bass, and still be loved ! You do what 'you love' in your time. Just keep slowing us great Basslines. Stay sincere, you're the man.

Love the neck beard!
This video really hit me in the feels 🤧🤌🏽
How does he look like a lot of people at the same time. With the beard he looks like atif aslam loool
funny thing is about forcing everyone to subscribe to you, Youtube unsubscribed me from you.
f
I’d keep watching if you played bass more often but you are so worried about subscribers I haven’t watched til now.
If I send $1000 usd you’ll send bass for free! Will you sign it for free as well?
nice honest talk
Bro you shouldn't be stressed about having just under 10 million Subs. Most artist will never achieve 9 or even close. You are a legend and should be happy with what you have and have fun don't worry about getting more subs just have fun doing what you love and subs will come. Life is too short to be sad over having 9 million Subs not 10. Take care buddy
You are the best
F
u said my country but have u ever been in VietNam :))??
Lookin' good Dave 🥵

You Sound so depressive ☹️ bro keep ya Head up stay strong whatever happens 💪

All in favour of keeping the beard?

Love the video.. this type of video slaps
I heard davie504's parents were actually just two upright basses
I wonder if Flea and Les Claypool think about the YouTube algorithm. Those two are amazing. Davie is good too.
F

True slappers cried when they realized he didn't say "omg" at the end
Love you dude. Hope you're staying sane in these troubling times
f
The beard makes you look north African.
I think Davie's getting a little jaded. This video is back to him being relentlessly funny but I've noticed lately in other videos he doesn't seem to have the same drive to be funny as he used to. This video explains why.
But guitars are better....
Love you buddy
Good shtuff
F 😨
it's not all about money... no... obviously it's all about that bass, 'bout that bass

You are really inspiring.
I'll get hench if you get hench Davie!
Ironically you look heaps more healthy with the beard!
*F* to davies 🅱️eard
You look better in this video than you ever have before
YOO the beard looks great on you!
Take care Davie!
take a rest whenever you need man. we love you :)
Plsss keep the beard
3:14 You inspired me to play bass, I always liked it, but I never really made up my mind until I started watching your videos. ♥️
"Like JusTin bIebEr~"  Davie: *shows pic of Shawn Mendes*
f
I sort of like the tone of the video. Still there is the signature aggressive editing&vid quality. There is a nice blend of dry wit and of "it's about me".  Great timing. These are qualities of a good comedian. Maybe start some sort of a comedy show on YouTube? As on the 69 thousand gazillon people subs celebration vid, when you did that japanese bass player Vs the real revealed Davie405. Anyways, I was on my way to re-watch a vid on TM Stevens, and I got distracted to watching this page. It did work great.   Best of luck to you! Ciao :)
Wishing you a speedy recovery, Davie!
Dude, I just turned 43... I wanna be like you when I grow up.  Why?  Because I have decent talent and decent equipment but crappy social skills.  So I drink beer in the basement where I live and play BASS and guitar (usually a baritone so it's not that bad lol) I think I should get a hooker.😁
davie responds to sora ( Japanese youtuber)
4:19 I choked when I saw sora the troll appear. Holy shi-
I like the beard 🙂

Davie looks like a thin Sylvester Stallone
Brilliant bro!
f
yoooou silly brilliant man!!!
Idc for yt. Davide Biale is a legend
Notice the good comments Davie! It's gonna get better, I promise you, cuz I have seen the future and it's EPICO!
From davie504 to Dave Ghrol
*Not a word about his fee-YONG-say* . This may be related to the streaked hair.
"Can't really plan my life in long terms...try to focus on smaller goals..." (he creates a female character to figth with more than a year after, or make a video to react today from his very beggingin...)
Lookin like a single dad of 4
Sora The Troll made it in the video! Oh yeah!
Don't shave goddammit, you look cool
OMG
I am a subscriber because I love bass and I think you are definitely one of the best bass players I've ever seen I try to watch all of your videos but you just have so many of them it takes a lot of time but everytime I noticed you make a new video I watch it I am always happy to see you have made a new video because it always inspires me to be a better musician thank you for being a YouTuber and spreading the good word of the power of the BASS
its good to see Davies genuine personality
Cover a Cowboy BeBop song please Davey!
Dude no joke the beard looks good as shit on you.
F
im watching....and dewd, leave the facial hair
I would enjoy more videos like this
k e e p  t h e  b e a r d
Possibly an unpopular opinion, but Chad Beard Davie > Nude Dude Davie
Good stuff man. Stay positive.
Beard
F for the beard
Davie.  Much respect for me.   I'm a 57 year old fan.  Can play a little guitar and even less on bass.  Here's a question for you.  At 6'7" did you ever play basketball or other sports either in school or just for fun with friends?  Also, can you dunk a basketball.   I love your channel and wouldn't care if you couldn't think of content for a video that you just jam on the bass.  Love your style.  Trying to get my 2 adult sons to subscribe but they are more gamers than music nerds like I am.  The younger one is 25 and likes music unless I say I like it than he doesn't like it anymore.   I did however take him to see Black Sabbath with Ozzy  for his 16th birthday.   Keep up the good work.
Davie inspired me to play guitar    so one day i can duet a bass player
F
Something that cannot be used to slap shouldn't be called a beard
This is so stripped down and love it . The beard is amazing.
I must confess my sins Davie.  I only watch 80% of your videos :(
Honestly, that beard really suits you Davie. Gotta keep that SLAPPA of a beard goin
We all love you Davie! Your health is whats most important always.
Love the beard !
I don't know you, but still, I have the feeling that you're a pretty cool dude to hang out with. You know, chill.
f
You looked more Italian with the beard
Wholesome
At the time of watching this, there were 850k views and 8500 comments. Awesome!
I think you have subscribers that just  watch less YouTube because they have less time like when they get a job or something. They are replaced with other subscribers but the ones who watch less YouTube are still subscribed so the total number still increases but number of views remains stable.
Stay healthy bro!
after this video he committed suicide
You look very tired on this video. Please rest a little, we can wait... your health is important because WE NEED MORE HOLLY SLAP (maybe the only comment not talking about your beard ... wait? ... bruh)
F
I hope you get well soon and I like your beard.  You're handsome anyway.  I typed into Google Snoop playing bass  and I couldn't find one that he's actually playing. Almost all vids were you.  Congrats on that!  By the way you are not far from 10m subs.
Davie should be in Pogchamps
F
Man you look handsome with your beard 👍🌷
Hey Davie I’ve got a bass related question  What bass would you recommend to someone who loves Fender P Bass, is a guitarist of 15 years turned bassist for an indie rock band, and who’s budget is ~$1000 USD? I love your videos and am glad that you’re doing well! I hate the algorithm too and am always glad to see your bass videos on my feed.
f
F
use it like a slang "HOLLY FUNK MAN"
Holly FUNK man.
There is something about your videos that made me realised a little later that i wasn't subscribed to you . Perhaps this is the reason for others forgetting to subscribe you as well.
YouTube is primarily a documentary and teaching platform.
F
This felt personal. I loved it.
OHHHHH YOU'RE PLAYING POKEMON GO!!! Same. Add me up!! <3

He lookin like both vsauce and krist novoselic at the same time

Italian? I thought you were Russian.
Hi dave! What you think about matt freeman? Bassist from rancid?
6:25 Это так мило:3
Cheer up Davie504, thanks to your videos I recently acquired a BASS and I, too, can now enjoy the power of BASS. You make a difference in the world.
Do you play basketball?
pls grow a beard
DO YOU PLAY BASSKET BALL
Bass for Slap like
RIP Davie's beard...shame, it could've been the most CHAD bass beard since Dusty Rhodes or Lee Skyler!
Feeling emotional rn
10M subs... So close but so far away. It's 9.67M, as I write this. Has @Davie504 hit the ceiling? ;-) @Davie504, when you reach 9,999,999, let me know and I'll get you over. Let's cut a hole in that ceiling!
Aku penggemar stia kamu guy's 🙏
F
I am commenting so that YouTube can recommend your video
You were never boring Davie504. 😉  Ps. Edited. I realized, I'm being disrespectful to just named you Davie. Haha.
Davie on saying justin bieber but put picture of Shawn Mendes on screen 😂
but can you play rush e tho?
I feel ripped off. No OMG.
Beard looks good👍🏻
DAVIE WE LOVE THAT EMOTIONAL MUSIC
F
F
In which language do you watch animes?
Omg, you just reach 666 videos

Thank you Davie. This was actually very good video. I really like youtubers being themselves. And also, the beard looks good
Wish you the best
"Can't wait for Chess 2" - this man is a natural comic genius as much as he is an awesome slapper. Never fails to make me laugh out loud - don't do that too often.
Grow it out!!!!
you suit a beard dude!
Davie i would helping saying that you should upload bass lines doing versus audience, it's nice listen how different minds create something with different instruments and same bass line 😁 take care
till 10 million suubs dont shave beard chalenge.
@Davie504 - Can you make a video 9or series of videos) for those of us whom you inspired to jump on the BASS wagon: what to look for when buying your first BASS - 4-string, 5-string, 6-string, active/passive, long/short scale, recommendations for best value BASS. etc.
Thank you so much, you are one of my inspirations.
Now, for some reason you look even more Italian
Davie, you are an a ultra amazing charm man
stanley kubrick bruh
I didn't know chess 2 was in development. I wonder if it will run on my hardware.
F
It was not boring at all, I actually believe that most of your fanbase really enjoys this kind of videos.
When u have a beard u look like my father (really)
Davie looks like my uncle who died in 911  *He was the best pilot in the military*   C’mon Davie you can do this. 10mil will eventually come
F
Imagine reading the comments and not subscribing. Imagine subscribing and hot slapping the like button. Imagine slapping the like button and not playing BASS.
10M sup coming,cheers
03:51 Real emotion reveal "obviously"
He even had a tip for youtube to better their algorithm..
It suits you. It gives you an aura of wisdom and maturity. 🙂
Happy or sad, we're here to support you my friend
A world tour would really be sick and encourage people about bass. It's a very cool and cyberpunk instrument and deserves more admiration.
I love this video a lot. You're so smooth in front of the camera lol
Man I thought I am the only one waiting for chess 2. It's about time
f
F
Dave you are one of the best Tubers, you are so funny.
do you have a plan to make a channel where you teach Bass?
I like the beard. Also TikTok has 700million subscribers where as YouTube has 2.3 Billion, also as you said YouTube pushes longer content TikTok is all about the short stuff. So more people are here watching a 2 hour long podcast and that dramatically cuts down them discovering or even having time to watch content from people they follow. It's not awesome, but if you buy enough YouTube stock you can show up at their investor meetings and yell at the CEO.
Love you too my friend
you have put Shawn Mendes photo but said Justin Bieber😂🤣
6:59 epic answer
Slap-well brother
Can I receive bass? Please
I slapped like so hard, it knocked his beard off! don't believe me? Watch the next released video!

You’ve promoted the most unloved instrument for years now. As a bassist, I thank you. Take a damn vacation.

I even slapped the notification bell🤧 AND I HAVEN'T DONE THAT BEFORE! I'll slap you, your videos are addictive😭
iIm pretty sure he's just going to SLAP that beard off.
are you okay pasta bass man
Twenty one pilot cover bass , no talk u damed😀
Save pop your beer right now
Leave the beard dude
More beard!
Chill bro, you have less than 1/10th of pewdiepie's subs but manage to land 1/3 his number of views on an average 1 day old video.  Pewdiepie would Highlander you on a live stream if he thought it would bestow him with an audience as engaged as yours. He's lucky to get 2.5% of his subscribers to watch his videos within the first day.
Stay cool man
Beard looks good
Chess 2??
f
It's good to see this side of you. The past two years have been amazing for your channel. You surfed the wave and now it is slowing down and it's ok. Take some time off, regroup and find new ideas. Enjoy the success you have for now with a step back, you deserve it. Start another channel where you stream games or whatever I also agree with the yt algo being fucked, sometimes it shows me more new content instead of the channels I am subbed to. It does more than it needs to which is very annoying, should be dialed down
F
Don't die dave
How about a bass battle with italian bassist Federico Malaman🤗
F
1:13 OMG I'M THE FIRST QUESTION!!! 😱😳
..."Can't wait for Chess 2"... :D
Digging the beard Davie !!
Davie! Grow the beard!! Please!!
You are an amazing person !
You should grow it out to a full beard before shaving it
6:19 Right. Your favorite country is Belgium.  Why would you do that to yourself?  ... Honestly?
Davie, if you have not watched it yet, I strongly recommend you watch the anime Death Note. Besides having a very complex and sophisticated plot, the soundtrack is awesome!  You can find it on Netflix.
Very funny, indeed! I watched this video with my kids and laughed a lot! You were inspired! A break sometimes is important so you can think about some things more deeply.
2:36 why was that so funny
And then you have those that watch your videos and do not subscribe - like me, until today...which means I will no longer watch your videos (sad, I know...). Unless of course you make more with your girlfriend in them (also sad :( I know...)
Bass daddy uwu
Oo
1000 usd is for the shipping only
Shoutout to davie for helping me realize how much I love bass and inspiring me to start playing
My favorite bass line comes from the ojays for the love of money
Come to brazil!!(but come to the south pls)
Davie thanks for so many great slapper videos🤘

Aah man, I feel kinda guilty for admitting I'm one of those subs that don't come back as often... but I'm here for this one! Please don't let the numbers get you down. Just glancing at the comments, it's obvious so many people cherish your vids!
Press F in the chat for Davie who didn't know Chess 2 was out

The beard looks great and will look even better in a week, Don't shave tell ten mill subs!
Hi Davie you are genuinely awesome and crack me up regularly. While I'm not a bass player, I was wondering if you could crank out some Rush Freewill solos for us. I slapped the like button on this video and hearing some Rush Bass makes me want to slap old ladies at church..(but none of them are your relatives or loved one's.) Keep Slapping My friend.. Long live Davie504.  And can you do some Tom Araya?  Cheers 🍻
Don't worry about hitting the 10 million subs mark. It doesn't matter. I don't give a shit, the guy next to me doesn't give a shit. We've just enjoyed watching your videos. I think you put too much pressure on yourself. Chill. But. The "beard". ... A max of 5 days stub is not a beard. Let it run amok and lets see it in 2 mths aye ? Keep on the good work.
The beard looks cool
i think Davie might be too hard on himself. part of why the talking videos do so well is purely that Davie is a likable guy and we just kind of like hearing from him.
Hi Davie, since you're Italian, do you know a band called called Måneskin? and if so do you like them?
F
What you have done to the bass as an instrument cannot be understated.  Keep it up buddy!
you look so good with that beard bestie, hope you get better
Chad.
Finally growing a beard
davie is depressy. must be hard to have so many  things weighing u down.
When did Hasan start playing bass and being an italian man?
+1 on helping to start learning BASS
Davie with long beard reveal? I need it
The beard looks amazing, you have to keep it!!!!
Just discovered you, my dude. Love your videos! Makes me want to get off my butt and be more creative.
Cool
I dunno why, but I cried 'cause of this video. Mayby, because I watched Davie's channel from the beggining, and now I see him being stressed due to so many followers... Dunno man, it's just really touching for some reason.
DAVIE!!!!!!!!… have you ever reacted or seen Valter Kabas? He is on You tube bass player. I think he is Brazilian? I don’t know if you have done a Bassist of Brazil but he is a good quality player . I first saw him 8 years ago when he did a  bass cover of “Lucky” by daft punk. You should check it out!
3:14 I’m at least one of those two people
F
Silencio Bruno!
You say it's taken ages to get to 10 mil but I remember when you were at like 3 mil or 5 mil or something. Didn't seem that long ago lol
I don't know about You, but I think I heard breathing at the end.
There is a small part in our time on this sweet world there a beard doesn't make us looking older :-/
Keep the scruff...It looks really good on you...DO IT: NOW!:)
I think Davie's growth was normal. Just like other youtubers, He started from Music covers,  Skits, Some unique ideas, QnA's, Crazy challenges, Then Fiverr videos, Challenges, Memes , Reveals and It's what shaped his Personality and His Audience today.
we love you davie
You look like an Italian

I wasn't really expecting too many videos in August anyway.  IIRC, nearly all of the Continent takes holiday during August.  Hope you get some time to relax, and yes, time to shave as well :D
Beard looks dope
Here's my question... Can you play the bass line for the TV show Barney Miller?
F
f
Maybe you need to work on your pee pee.
Davie is the only one capable of being both relaxing and jarring simultaneously
YouTubes algorithm is the equivalent of a random number generator. Sometimes you’ll get recommended shit from 2005 with 100 views and sometimes you’ll get recommended the actually creators you’re subbed to it’s weird as hell
Hey Davie, I am afraid sequel to best computer game ever called Chess 2 is not yet ready, but you still can play prequel called Checkers.

Be well. =)
I'm gonna hunt down your bass only stuff!
As someone who looks younger than their actual age, and also has a beard, I'd recommend keeping it.  Growing my beard (although it isn't great and I have to keep it trimmed for work), was the best decision I made in my 20s.
"It's not all about money, alright" Literally cried on this part 💔❤
F
Great stuff, Davie, thanks for the video :) Made me smile a lot
hey davieeeee you can makeee videos about cool bass parts and grooves. I think people will really like those.

No beard shaving video? smh

Davie.... Don't forget about the people you've inspired. I know it can be easy to see people as just numbers on a screen, but Davie, you've inspired me so much with your passion for playing Bass. Watching this video made me cry because you're really successful, but you still get sad, just like I do. Seriously though, you're passion for the bass has inspired me as a painter, and even as a writer. The way you play Bass is different than I've ever seen anyone play ANY instrument. I used to hate my art, but you're one of the YouTuber's that changed things around for me. Now I love to paint again.   Don't let the numbers get you down. Know that even though you have subscribers like me, who don't comment, but watch every single one of your videos. I clicked this one immediately.  Feel better soon, Davie. Seriously. I don't know you personally but you've touched my life with inspiration, and lots of laughter.
I'm trying to learn bass but I accidentally bought a guitar on accident so for now I practicing my slapping picking and finger strength
Looking forward to the colonoscopy reveal.

Shaving a beard is never a good idea.
This video is EPIC, like you

Hey davie in your video idea why not buy a bass that changes colours
Hey Davie, just wanna say that I'm your new fan, so please keep uploading more fun videos
f
He has so much ideas and imagination this video says that itself (XD)
Davie I'm a sub for 2 years i think, but I can't watch every upload you do, among many subs only a percentage is possible. Shit I'm a guitarist!
Dave!! Faz um bass cover de "Bed intruder" Haha
You should go with a Italian moustache, just like Mario Bro, be like Davie bro.
Just go surfing Davide

Keep it beardlook! You looks great👍
luv u Davie

He looks so handsome with a beard.
much prefer videos like this when you're serious and being yourself
I thought it's Davie504's big brother... Davie503
Do you think to make a would tour with a band? Everybody loves you!
you can slap me in the face and i will slap the other side bc slapp
Can you do a cover of “ DOING STOP BELIEVING BY JOURNEY “ ?
Davie's beard could slap a bass anytime of any day!
You look like you just got a divorce and lost your kids and dog. I'm so sorry this happened to you. I guess your slap hand is a bit to strong for the general public.
f
For one, I love your bass videos the best. Some of them are in playlists for music listening even (deadmau5, fretless bass ones, to name a few). Too bad Youtube doesn't reward these/you more. Also, I watch ALL your videos and I think they are great. Good luck with the struggle (new ideas), take your time.
You look great with a beard!
F for Davie's beard
F
Good bye beard! Ok, I admit I don’t watch too many of your videos…I don’t really like bass… I just think you’re a nice guy, and I like your dry deadpan style. I’ll try and find time to watch more! And as someone else has said, the last year and a half of Covid has shifted a few priorities around for many people. Take care, and remember, your worth is not your subscribers or views or likes.
F
Im on it my guy i took all my friends phones and subscribed on their accounts for them im now on to doing it to stranger's you gonna hit that 10 mill hell or high water
Depression
Now this is a *TRUE AVERAGE ENJOYER MOMENT*
F for the beard ,but I think it looks good on you
You see, people get bored of your content no matter how good  it is. I am your subscriber, but I watch like one of your videos per week, same with pewds and everybody, I don't think you should feel bad about it, its just how these things work.
I will make sure to watch your videos!!
Bearded Davie looks like Nas Daily somehow
i love the Fact that the Advert before this was for Gillette Mens shaving Blades.
is davie ever gonna play korn in the present?
To be honest, I like this kind of videos from time to time. Good job! And don't stress yourself too much, there are more important things in life than subscribers.
I came here after listening to Jolyne's theme.  Yep I will now ask to nake a covah or reaction :)))). You don't have to if you don wanna :)))))
why do you have a guitar in the background Davey?
Hey Davie. Do what you want in life, whatever makes you feel good, whenever you feel like doing it. Every now and then I need to see a Davie504 video, I know it's going to make me smile and feel better.
Beard suits you well ! keep it !
OK, so finally I decided to subscribe to your channel.  Partly because I want to be among the first million – before – you hit a million, partly because I've watched and liked many of your videos without being a subscriber (so obviously your videos reach beyond your subscribers, I wonder what that reveals about the YT algorithm...)  But most importantly: I noticed a six string bass (with very thin strings!) in this video that looks a lot like a Fender Jazzmaster guitar. Not that I am a fan, but I really like six string instruments with very thin strings, I have a couple of them.  I consider this a reveal ('Davie504 owns a guitar'), but I realize at the same time that this could be old news, due to the fact that I don't see all your videos (YT algorithm, you mentioned it...) and you revealed this fact already ages ago... Well it new for me, so...  Off course, I also own a bass (and sometimes even play it). An acoustic fretless. I recently put some black nylon flatwounds on it. Wow!

Why no OMG at the end?😔
Youtube have bigger cost by 1 click than tiktok Youtube have more detal recomendation system And other stuff  Yo, don't do the goodbye part in the video, they don't really watch it, which is bad for view retention
Hey davie, You inspired me to start playing bass, it’s been one of the best things for my mental health and I’m just about to do my grade 1! hoping to get to grade 8 before I’m 30, wish me luck 😅 x
Davie looks insanely smart with beard

Congrats you have made 666 videos =))
Make a vid but only talking in a different accent
What is your PayPal so I can send you the cash to get one of those free bassesesss?
Dave, you inspired me to pick the bass back up after 15 years, and now both my kids are learning too. Keep up the good work, and spread the slap!

Hey Davie, play "Sir duke "  bass
OMFG the spaghetti mafia is here to end all guitarists' career 😭😭😭
I can tell that you’re a bit tired out from youtube. Most people say it isn’t a job, but don’t actually know how much work you put in your videos. You deserve a break, and take all the time you need to try and destress. I doubt you will actually see this comment, but everybody gets overworked and overstressed. Please, don’t feel bad about it. Take whatever time you need to recoup. You deserve it.
Davie you got my girlfriend into bass, more or less - you're awesome bro. From Texas
Good vid!
Hey, Davie, maybe uploading LESS frequently would help your subs watch you more? They'd feel more important! 2 videos per week is a bit exhausting, especially on top of other YouTubers that constantly upload. Just a thought from a subscriber that cares about you and loves you!! Please, take breaks. And stay funky.
6'7" and 84 kilos? Geez, man. Eat something. I'm 6'1 and was skinny as hell at 80 kilos.
Um, the beard looks good on you. NOOOOOOOOOO! NO SHAVE! Trim, yes. Shave? NOOOOO!
I'm already subscribed Davie! I can't subscribe again. I'm as subscribed as I can be! 10 mil will be here before you know it.
Like the beard!!! Were is the girlfriend?
Hope you feel better soon Davey🙂
DAVIE I LOVE THE BEARD PLEASE KEEP IT
I love the real Davie. That's it! That's the comment.
3:50 Was that a... was that a... small laugh? :o
Have you considered using the community tab more? I think that'd be a good way to have your fans stay engaged with your channel without you having to worry about pushing out a lot of content on a regular basis! I understand making these videos can be a lot of work and can get draining after a while. The community tab would be a relatively easy and quick way to keep generating interest in your channel when you need to take a break from video making for whatever reason. Of course, this is just a suggestion and you're free to do your channel however you want :)

Davie504 looks like a dad with a beard
davie's beard looks as bad as i am awkward talking to someone new
I like the beard. You should keep it.
F
your beard is EPICO 🧔🏻
6:00 That moment you realize the "504" is just Davie's birthday, but you're American and accustomed to the month being listed before the day (eg: 04/05/1994), so it's taken you 3-4 years to realize this fact...
Do you have any band?
F.
Davie your personality and worldviews are as good and interesting to me as your bass playing. I think you should add these kinds of vlogs to all of your videos. I mean, I love hearing YOU play bass, but sometimes I really don't care about the subject of your videos. I believe YOU should be the subject of YOUR vids! Take care of yourself Davie!
F
Looks great with a beard
Embrace the beard life bro
Wholesome. Stay healthy Davie
Davie504, if you play the bass line from When Doves Cry it will catapult you to 20M followers
fang cool off with the facial  hair. Hope to see your next episode
just end the videos with OMG dude I was waiting for it
"Can't wait till Chess 2.0"  LOL
can u do vlog, i mean house tour like dat
Davie was born on the exact same day on the exact same year Kurt Cobain died, also the same day as my birthday
Leaving a comment for the algorythm. Love u davie. Hope u stay fine. 💕
DAVIE504 I CHALLENGE YOU TO SLAP SOME PEANUT RIFFS!!!! I know it will be IMPOSSIBLE for you! Cmon who wants to see it..  SLAP LIKE!!!

f for beard
You be starting too look like the guy from csgo shroud
I dig the facial hair, looks good on you.  Glad you're taking care of yourself. Definitely a fan of the bass-only videos, but I love all of them. Keep it up my man
What sonno Italiano?! Saludos desde argentina increibles videos de bajo, estudiaste formalmente musica? Conoces de musica experimental y contemporanea para Bajo?

Love you davie! Superb work! I'm sorry i'm not here as often as i was, but man you're doing great! If this year i'nst as good as last year, take it as a good thing, work harder, or take some days off. But stay safe and health!

You make me smile . . . thanks.   Also, where's a link to your music?
I love Davie's acting and comedy, but when he tones it down for a video like this, it just feels so wholesome
Hey Davie504 - didn't know I needed this channel in my life. I slapped myself for not knowing this.  Great beard. Great channel.
First time I see you looking like an adult.  Woooooow!
dont do drugs and stay safe davie 503
I'd say beard Nooooo. But a Goatee would look good.
jolyne theme when?
Nice
I would love to see you do some rock/metal/jazz/funk melody/jam band. Make it a collaboration or something.   I love your music and man......its so good.....give me more!
Net you cant do Hit the Lights from Metallica,  "No Life till leather demo" on YT.  Especially Dave Mustain 🐔💩
I'm part of the 900% who doesn't watch all your videos. I'm happy to see you again, you're a cool guy and now I'm watching some of your videos for today. Keep it going 💉
I was worried when I opened this video. Glad to hear you’re well and working out. I appreciate your bass videos, I hate the YouTube algorithm.
You look like Stallone in Rocky 4 with that beard
Keep The Beard!!!!
No dude, in 5 years, you'll be good. Music will keep you going no matter what.
Thanks davie for all the great videos along all the time you have been on youtube, and even to this day whenever i look up a rhcp song Ill always find a random cover of it by you playing it with a vegetable or in an aeroplane. Glad to know im at least one out of the two people you inspired to play bass! Stay funky bro <3
MISA MISA MISA!!! But if I couldn't get MISA to play Bass in my band I guess Davie 504 would be a close second. So, keep up those chops.
OMG where?
F
do you make a website called onlybASS ? i would choose the 300 dollar subscription to see hard slapped bASSes.  :D
i still play pokemon go too uwu
Davie504, I have a confession. I used a pick to like this video.
speaking of anime i watched ace get a fist through his chest on one piece the other day... someone tell me he actually lived lmao i liked ace more than almost all the characters. he was like the kakashi of one piece
Davie, I am old enough to be your father, I don’t have any Italian children that I know of, but still.  You are 6’7” I am 5’7”, this may not be a coincidence.  Now go shave, you look like one of Jack Sparrow’s cabin boys with that facial spinach.  Stay Funky young Super Star.
That beard fits you really well dude! You should keep it for some time ;)
SDAIAY!!
I'm so glad you liked my country!
I legit stopped getting your videos on my front page on youtube. Usually anything new that you would upload would show up there, and in the past 2 months I havent been seeing any of your new videos show up. If I see you have something new, I would normally watch it, but now I have to goto your page to see if there is any new content.
I have SLAPPED liek on the only video were davie has a beard
Also agree that YouTube should force users to slap the subscribe button.
Have you ever played treble?
F
😂😂 I can’t wait for Chess 2 😂😂
Can't wait for Chess 2 hahahaha
“With your mouth” 😂❤️
Bullshit you didn't like my country. You've never once had maple syrup or weed in your videos (basically our national identity) so you've obviously never been here.
You look like Davie504 on a relaxed Sunday morning. Drinking a cafe. Having some Italian breakfast foods (breakfast pizza? breaksfast pasta? I'm Italian and I no idea) while sitting on the patio and watching the clouds blow by Mt. Vesuvius and wondering how many people are still alive under all that ash....
Davie with a beard is like Charlie wearing a black T-shirt.
F
hi
Enjoy your games Davie, take a rest. Come back even stronger.
Beard looks good 👍
hey davie, wanna play chess?
F
you suddenly looked like the bearded Shroud, you should do gaming again, lol
Last time I watched Davie, he was on 4 million subs! He is almost at 10!!!!😳😳congrats brother 😩
Goodbye Beard504, hello Davie504
Bruh you look way better with beard
The beard makes you look even more Italian
Looks.. Italian
Do you still have same girlfriend? If not, can i have your old girlfriend? She was really cute 🥰
Dave504. You could take your bass out busking and make videos of it and peoples reactions.
your beard looks like a beard
I like your beard. It could be fun to see how the beard looks like with some more time for variety.
God forbid;  What if you lost your right hand, how would you play bass?
F

Keep is strong brother BASS SHALL FOREVER LIVEEEEEE
Stay strong bro, I liked the beard, can it play the BASS?

DAVIE PLAYS CHESS?????
Oh the beard 🧔‍♀️ gotta keep it.
Very impressive, but can you play californiacation in California, and sweet home Alabama in Alabama?
Vuoi fare un video di Rammstein - Seemann? una chitarra acustica?
no "OMG!" in the end? are you really okay Davie?
Here's an idea for your bass music in longer videos. Instead of using those calm tracks, you can make your own and have it playing in the background during these talking videos. An example of some of your calm work can be #30-35 from your "50 ways to play bass" video
F
Davie504 4K reveal, when?
B is for Beard B is for Bass     B is life...
F
We appreciate you so much, Davie Just to share, I actually got interested playing the bass watching you, me and my cousin watch your videos to have a good laugh together Thank you
EFF
maybe if you made less anime related content i would actually watch the videos
I really appreciate the content you come up with. The video was great. Stay Funky...
F
Beards nation!
Con la barba stai benissimo 👍👍
I have been waiting for Chess II also!
'F' For Beard!
Nice beard Davie, keep that always
U look good
Give me some sunshine give me some rain
That was deep.  Like, baseline deep.
I don't watch Davie anymore coz of how repetitive the content has gotten. The titles have stayed the same for so long now. Just seeing the same titles again (eg- stop this *insert country* bassist) turns me off towards clicking on the video. I'm still subbed coz man can Davie play a bass.
Really Loving the Beard
F just here to say hi after a long time
Why Davie's height isn't 6' 9" ...lol
thanks for being here :)

non sei autorizzato ad avere la barba a Taiwan.
F
F
Appreciate you, Davie.
Hey, Davie! I first discovered your channel in 2020 and have been a frequent user since. I think maybe people are getting back to their normal livrs around the world, or in my case, Brazil is a big fuc*ing mess. So probably people are just having less time to spend on YT or struggling more with our daily life. You've been a comic and musical relief for me and for thousands. Maybe it's time to also invest in other social medias, but never to give up because you truly are very important for millions that follow your work.
8:25 F
*Uncle David energy*
The only reason to build muscle is to slap bass harder.
F
I'm waiting for Chess 2 too
Can t wait for Chess2   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Davie Shinoda
I’m on the Chess 2 preorder already! Love it!
Also if you want views, just post a few shorts, they'll get reccomended to almost everyone.
"Dead" xD
This video wasn't boring at all, it's just you being you, and that's alright. Maybe these videos are being popular because it's all about the content creators opening up and all. I'm not a content creator myself, but it's nice to see YouTubers opening up, expressing their opinions about stuff and all that, it just feels like an oddly nice change of pace sometimes in my opinion
F
We love u just sayin
Well since you ARENT running out of ideas, I'll reccomend one. Play Friday Night Funkin' while funkin' on friday.
b e a r d
I enjoyed this beard reveal... but.... WHERE'S THE OoooMmmmGgggg ENDING???
Threaten secretly the 'algorithm', saying you may make a video about freedom, heath + freedom ... You'll be 20 millions subs in a week. Be proud the 'algorithm' is messing, it means great value nowadays 😑 BASS ! Funky brother we're crossing a strange weather, set the strings of your sailbass.
really good beard
@davie504 dude don't u're HOT
Davie make a bass on a indian song please...
You can only fuzz bass if you have fuzzy face.
f beard
I like videos like this
I´m a little bit dissapointed ... i mean onlyfans ? Why you didn´t signed in to onlybase ...
Epico! Your my inspiration to learn base and music you're giving me a passion from the B A S S! Your lit no matter what!

Im loving this antihumor man. Also, chin up. Your an amazing person, a talented bass player (who ranks in my top 5) and a damned youtube superstar. You have a lot going for you Davie504. Stay funky bro.
Leave the beard
My heart goes out to you. It must be tough having only 9M subs and being able to make a living from making YouTube videos.
david looks like Turkhis peoples
Love you Davie!
Davie can you play a japanes bass koto instrument it would be nice to hear it😁
Thank YOU davie504 for inspiring me into buying my first instrument, an electric guitar. EPICO

Great video. I like the beard too.
I don't like Davie when the question said: how do you find yourself in 10 yrs? He said: dead... Wtf
Nice Beard
Davie with a beard is kinda cursed.
I’m half tempted to send you $1000 USD dollars to get the free bass!  People should pay you $1000 for this so long as you SLAP it, and them later at a meet and greet!  🤚 💥
When are you going to married?
Esilarante come sempre! 🤣
Next part?
Wholesome Davie
Pls give me bass
Cool beard 😳 i have noting to say so yeah
@Davie504 a list of your top 10 bass players ever would be interesting to see! #1 will be yourself of course, but the other 9? Salutes from Sweden
Thank you for gifting me samsung s21 ultra🤗
Please can you play Bad Habbits on bass. PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE
Do you. Don’t ever not be you. It’s what got you here.  Love you.

Davie you have 666 videos

Davie: 6:21 Me from kazakhstan:🗿
Stay well maestro.
You could do an sdaiay with musical memes and not only memes about you
U know when u did the video about that japannese girl bassist? She did a video to thank u for the bass battle and for some oportunity idk i wasent paying much attention to the captions can u pls react to that video?

WHAT? Where the H3IL is the SLAP?? WEAK VIDEO, NOT APPROVED 🤬
F
Davie don’t forget that even though you’re not getting as many views as you used to, over 700,000 views on a video is enough to blow my mind I’f it happened to me, and 700,000 is still a lot of people who love your videos :)
I love you davie
If I subscribe again, that would be cheating. You have inspired me (a guitarist) to switch to bass last year. Digital G string slap from the US bud.
Beard good
I think that maybe your current energy should meet your bass solos. If your solos have been slapping hard and fast, you could try soft and slow. I dont recall an epic slowed pased solo series. You could explore another mood through this phase .
You are beautifull <3
That sad soundtrack had me in tears by the end of the video. 😂 Stay funky bro ✌🏾 from India.
F
ideas for your videos? I didn't see all your videos, so you might already did this, but here it comes, the history of the bass, how the bass has influence in the music, play in the street asking money (you are very Famous so wears a costume).  Make 1 video all in Italian, it will be OMG. Let's make a game, use random images, sentences or wherever and try to say something funny of each? do a funky concert with the best musician that you have been talking on youtube, at least one song?
F
Rock that beard homie
Beardcore is basscore
when i make a joke in class the whole class:lugh* teacher: 6:16
on the other hand, how you can feel great for winning the world cup with the Materazzi vs Zidane episode? Why the Italians don't like the pineapple pizza? And the last one, do you know any Italian how don't like the pasta?
Deep beneath this caustic YouTube character you play, sometimes you sound truly annoyed by your viewership. Take a break man, for your mental health. We’ll still be here, I promise.
stay funky bros
Beard grow looks great, a stache would be better ;)
4:14 We live IN A society.😉
Challenge: eat spaghetti while playing bass 😉
Your beard has Italian energy around.             Stay safe, Davie.
indonesianians will always support you, stay healty
Play YOASOBI on bass please!
One of your best video David

The serious music really did a number on me.
O Its look amazing davie👍
I love you, Davie - but don't do any more freaky shit with your hair!! It might make it fall out for real. I wish that the guitar companies would send a bass to YOU for free! That would be EPIC. Any way........Thank you again and stay groovy!!!
dear god do you blink???????????
Davie if you ever read this comment, i hope you know that we wanna see you happy. This video being sincere and honest has been some of the best content in a while. You need to be happy and healthy to make the content you want to make, even if it takes a break every now and then! Keep the passion in your heart but don't be afraid to be real with us, we won't go anywhere.
I was a hobby guitar player who bought a bass last month and then found your videos. I find them inspiring! So that's at least three
PLEASE PLEASE INCLUDE SUBTITLES IN SPANISH
Davie is legit inspiring more kids to play bass than anyone else at this point. I think that's a good thing.
Davie ur all cover are easy I didn't slap sub button but if u can cover idaten jump ost 4 theme then I ll praise u and slap sub and like I challenge u😠
“how to speak english properly and correctly Davie:  “using your mouth.” Amazing tip.  Thank you, sir.  Best response, in my opinion.

Stay safe and stay healthy Davide

Love the beard!!
Keep da goddamn beard broda its pretty cool
F
No OMG
Chess 2 ..I literally laughed out loud I couldn't stop
F
I know you probably wont see this, but Im really sorry that youtube stresses you out. Youre just doing what you love man. Thats gotta be rough. Take care of yourself and your mental health first. We can wait. Especially if that means we know you feel better.
F
Davied are you okay?
why no sad bass background music? missed opportunity xD
[F]
Solo 1% delle persone capiranno cosa o scritto
F
So good to see you relaxing for a bit, not pushing stuff. That's health !!! Now, you want me to subscribe? Then... I challenge you! to make a short video, in your style, but using the words the auto subs sometimes "understands". Like "fibre" instead of "fiverr" or "ethical" instead of "epic" (check your videos). Stay safe AND healthy!
people with sick and beautiful beard: i dont like  me, with 3 transparent hairs on my chin at 26yo: :(
Don't joke about being dead in 5 years Davie, that would really suck
I think the reason a large % of your subs might not watch all the videos, is they either have a large sub list, and they get flooded with videos, or, they get on to watch something and then the sidebar recommendations lead them down a rabbit hole of far too many things and they don't get a chance to remember to watch Davie. I know these both happen to me for most channels I subscribe to. (Perhaps many got burnt out on the memes also? I think these more lowkey videos are more relatable personally and I enjoy them more.)  Do keep making just bass videos though, always good to watch/listen to them when I get around to it, which isn't necessarily on the day of upload.
Nobody wrote f y! DECIDED TO COMMENT F
We need more sdaiay
Therapist: Davie with a beard isn’t real, he can’t hurt you. Davie with a beard:
Nice facial hair
I haven’t watched in over a year and OH SNAP BEARD REVEAL!
I tuned out for a while and just saw this in my recommended. Hope you're doing good Davie.
I genuinely expected you to have drawn on a beard, or gotten one of those costume ones. Color me surprised you actually grew it out :D
Dude, I understand how hard it is to keep coming up with new ideas especially ones that'd be enjoyed by the majority. That added to the work of of editing, filming etc, sometimes, the idea of giving up comes so easily. I'm an aspiring content creator too but I already feel this way lmao. I can only imagine what you go through but it wasn't gonna be easy from the start so I guess we'll keep moving👌🏻
OMG
Beard 🧔‍♂️
beard Davie is too powerful
frettless
Play some slap on a fret's
Been following you for a long time and always loved your contents. Former musician for more than 10 years and now an insurance advisor. Currently I’ve lost all motivation for the two when I’ve lost loved ones. Nowadays I just stream my gameplays but even that’s slowly dying. How do you keep yourself motivated despite the challenges you’ve come across? Because I’m just lost now. Hope to hear from you. Cheers.

DON'T SHAVE IT
Holy shit there is a question from Sora
You come across as anxious and wound up in this video. Maybe you shoud take a break or quit if staying relevant is becoming too stressful, no point burning yourself out.
I left this channel for like a year and i come back just in time for beard reveal
Why is the background music not Bass??
you look so much better with that beard i think you should keep it
Wow the views is on 666K

Beard is sick no 🧢

Do some traveling and playing bass
Music is not emotional without bass guitar. WTF bro I thought this was a bass channel not a sad piano channel.
8k times more views/sub on tictok is ridiculous! YouTube is beyond repair. Hope you feel better Davie.
was really chill, i liked it; it relaxed me
Slap the sickness.
Nashe man
That beard is great, don’t shave!!
not gonna lie, was kinda hoping to see davie with a fully grown and nicely cut beard. good video though. really enjoyed the transparency, and seeing davie's true personality! F
You should keep it, it s so cool
u should dye your beard
That wet underarm tho
F
Davie Blaine?
Will u be happy if everyone in the world play bass
epico
Keep the BEARD!
Actually the beard looks good on him right ?🤗
F for the beard
Davie, you're the best bass player I've seen. You can literally play anything! Keep slapping, and keep your head up, bro. The pressure is a lot, but remember you've got the same amount of love slapping back with you!! 👋

Fan from India... Sorry ... Tik tok was banned in India🇮🇳

I know how you feel about being tall. I myself am 6 feet 8 inches tall.
The beard looks great my guy, though I've always preferred clean shaven. That being said, still looks good. ❤
You, kind sir, most definitely inspired me to start playing bass, even though at first it only was with my Epiphone Les Paul Jr. , tuned as a bass. So two weeks ago, after more than a year, i finally got me a BASS !!! 🎉🍹🍻👌😎 Now i am jammin  a brand new Ibanez TMB100 Talman !!!  This Bass  is  Biiitchiiiin .... 🎸👌😎  So, Thank "you" Davie504.  Hopefully one day we can slap together ...  If i can manage to learn how to ....   Take Care, Be Well, and Stay Funky. 🖐
Davie, have you heard of the person "Yanni"?
What are you doing?!! SUBSCRIBE!!!
That beard looks hood
Get some rest, your eyes looks so tired like mine.

Man, (speaking of chad packs) the beard has massive Chad vibes! Btw, rather then replacing the camera (which one are you using?), you may get a second one (more angles faster XD). Canon M50 is kinda the go-to Youtuber cam atm.
You can always play a whole symphony on bass. That will extend the length of the video! Checkmate youtube algorithm!
He's 6'7''??? God damn
Why am I so in love with you?
You should keep your beard long

Davie.. could u play suga suga on ur bass...?
YouTube forces you to start off on recommended instead of subs and doesnt show your subs ahead of recommended. They keep spamming me with shorts and same videos on repeat on YouTube. Also the world is opening again so I guess means less viewers. Personally I try to catch up on the vids.
Keep the beard ☹️ 🥺
Not sure if I've missed it but have you ever played 5 string bass?
Aaron Rodgers if he slapped bass
I am really surprised no big band has asked him to try out. He's one of the best bass players in the world right now; like an Italian Les Claypool.

Just play bass! Waiting for more albums on spotify ;-)

It’s happens with everybody davie ! Just focus on creating videos don’t think about future 🔥
Yeah this is what a bassist should look like, don't shave off your manliness again, you look tough💪💪💪💪
I think he should take a pause and be gratefull for the success he had in the past years.Numbers arent everythingHe also puts a lot lf work into his content,which not everybody does.He can be proud about himself.

When Davie said he inspired at least two people to play bass he's not kidding.
seems youtube pissed you off -> bass battle youtube
Love the beard
Davie I challenge you to try to play African basslines
Dud I'm 6'0.5 and I'm just 15 LMAO xD
I'm one of the two that you inspired to start to play bass!

although you used some emo music i had some really great laughs. keep it up, you're doing well and your videos are usually special 10 minutes to be intensely distracted from reality and that is really relaxing when days are stressfull.. thank you!

i subscribed a year ago...and i never missed a new video after that...i may have not watched all the old ones but i never miss the new ones.............and i enjoy watching him so much...ive not been in a very good place since last year and davie is among the few reasons i laugh genuinely....and i dont think we need to question his bass playing....its among the best....as always...... I LOVE YOUR WORK DAVIE.
Play ingress, not pokemon go, ingress is the BASS of gps games
The reason SDAIAY started being the same jokes every time was that it turned into "let's look at recent posts on my subreddit" and stopped being "some days ago I asked you".
You armpit get wet in tight shirt
Come to india
I think I like how you look with a beard more than I do without, it makes you look more like you've grown up along with your fan's, which is what so many YT'ers find even more sentiment in their communities that have been following them long enough to be considered og or veteran tier fan's, who know more about the person on camera, & educate the new fan's. Love from Canada.

Why did you put the piano for the background emotional and relaxing music... instead of a bass?
Bearded muscle Davie... so hottt   F
The reason Davie gets more views on TikTok rather than on YouTube is because on TikTok, when somebody is scrolling and comes to your video it counts as a view. But on YouTube you actually have to click on the video to count as a view. It is confusing but if you think about it, everytime Davie's video goes on the front page of YouTube it could count as a view on TikTok and not on YouTube

I’m also 6’7 (202 cm), but I weight 102 kg. 84 is impressive. I need to eat less 😅.
I know it's hard advice from someone who's probably anonymous and you probably won't even read, but taking time to yourself is also pretty important.  Don't put these numbers in front of your mental health man. You're already a legend. The 10mil will come naturally.  I see that Pewdiepie is a great inspiration for your content, so take a note of how he's changing his schedule sometimes and taking time for himself, that really made him better.

Beard is deep dark. Deep is bass. Bass is good. Beard is good. Next question.
I think Youtube's system is confused with the humongous amounts of videos uploaded every minute and it impacts lots of channels, I hope they could do something about it to make discoverability/recommendations as effective as it was before. This video wasn't even recommended to me and I have the notification on.
GOD BLESS BRO,, EVERYTIME I WATCH YOUR VIDEOS I REALLY FEEL BETTER,, THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS IN MAKING US SMILE,, WE LOVE YOU BRO,,
OMG BEARD REVEAL
i misss theee thanossss bass
Davie,play some bass from the KISS band.
Love you Davie. Take a break if you need to.
i dont slap like enough and i should comment on Davies content and the dude n his small crew do an amazing job.... its sad and strange how youtube can make some1 as popular as davie feel uncomfortable about paying bills n what not.... who knows how things will be next month... next year? good luck friend.
thank you for not shaving your headphone hairs.
Very disappointed you have guitar at your back :(
LMFAO @5:48  So fast!
Grow full beard and shave it with a bass
keep well Davie,  take a break and get better
The beard looks good, but it’s weird because it makes you look Italian or something, which you clearly are not.   Seriously, the “talking videos get more engagement and build more audience than bass playing videos” is a dilemma I have in working with one of the best classical bass soloists. She’s very shy, particularly about her English, so all her videos are just playing. They get decent engagement for what they are, but it’s a struggle to really build an audience. No way is she going to get millions of followers like you if she never talks to her audience.  Some of her videos went viral on Facebook and got over 1 million views, but only like 10,000 on YouTube.  So I’ve seen that same situation. Facebook lets people share with friends and groups, YouTube has no such thing.  Now that your videos are a little more “normal” and straightforward, I’ll probably start watching them more again. I don’t mind the dry humor, but an excessive emphasis on jokes and memes isn’t as interesting to me.
F
Davie504 income in youtube is more than any other bassist who perform in concert
I don’t know why this video seems deep and sad but I can’t point out why, hope that you are still doing good davie 🥰

You look handsome with a beard 🔥🔥👌
Get well soon Davie
Yo Davie, the beard looked good. Quick question post Q&A have ypu ever thought of taking some time off from making YT videos like how pewdiepie did a couple of years ago. It might give you some rest and clarity on what route you want to take the channel.  Much love, A fellow bassist and longtime sub
Davie's apparent age without a beard: 25 Davie's apparent age with a beard: 25
I played an early release of Chess 2 and and it is Fantastico. Checkmate
This video has such a more realistic and honest vibe, and I appreciate it
It's probably the v.
Davie should play birdland
Idk he look like someone who is named David.
I sub to like, 300 channels on youtube. And the garbage algorithm means i can see like, 6 new videos a day and and ton of garbage from 11 years ago shoved down my throat lately.  That's why your view counts are trash suddenly.
I am no depressed 😫
U inspired me 2 play bass u are an amazing person keep it up dude , stay funky Davie :)

Why was relaxing background music not BASS? I would feel better if you would end all your videos by playing us some BASS --- go on -you can do it!
You look more tired than Vince Vaughn in this video
"DV" is a 27 year old man presenting to the emergency room with a huge beard. "It was just a beard" he said. The doctors analyzed DV with "hyperbeardgenomeemia". Hyper meaning many, beard genome meaning the genomes of beards, emia meaning presence in blood. Little does he know that this is how his beard didn't grew anymore.
Love you man
lovin the beard, man!
Old Man Davie
It definitely wasn't boring Davie. We love u and everything about your content. Stay funky!

Agreed. Anime has great music in it.
I'd love to see some of your recent grooves on itunes! Are you planning to release a new album?
The video editing is a little bit intense in this video.
Never gonna give you bass
Weight reveal! Finally LOL!
Sora the troll spotted trolololo
Grow it
F
The reason more subscribers don’t watch your videos is because you tell everyone to subscribe, the same as every other YouTuber and some of them post multiple videos a day. Now our subscribe pages have more videos than we can watch and things get lost. But the homepage is still recommending videos from ten years ago from rando pages we’ve never watched. So it’s not you, it’s YouTube.
F
Some free bass ideas: let cartoon characters play bass; bass playing in movies review; bass played by small children and very old people; fun and games with base; compose movie background music with bass; contact some bass vendors for a bass givaway; one-handed bass challenge; the best and weirdest accessories for bass; the science of bass; history of bass; if you want more just ask, I can keep going.
I avoided subbing to Davie for so long and it was actually the donating to streamers that got me
Weird request, Davie, You told you enjoy playing chess, why don't you collaborate with Chess youtuber/streamers. It will be fun knowing you through chess.  :))
F
Good beard
it seems like you're getting fit now, Davie. or is it just because of the beard 🤣 stay healthy bro.
You are hot with a beard.
in my opinion I think it is time for you tubers to hit the road… join together and get some live gigs and crush it…
You should sleep early

Try to be proud of what you have. Don't let the dream of growing exponentially force you to constantly look forward, never looking back on the absolutely spectacular work you have already done. You are amazing.

heyy, Davie, your fans will always support you no matter what <3 idk if this is a sad music or me, but you seem a bit down. playing bass and making vids shouldn’t be your burden, always remember about your mental health, take a break if you feel like it, it’s totally ok and we will understand :) sending you all my love and support :>
F
Dear Sir, I just found your channel via 2set Violin.  I have subscribed to help you reach your goal.  I enjoy your content.
Hi Davie hope you keep on being well. I think that Youtube simply has too much content for a lot of people that makes it kinda difficult to keep up at it sometimes. It happens to me that I like watching my subscribed channels and due to the daily hassle it's kinda hard to see all of them at the same time and YouTube doesn't promote a lot of music channels nowadays unless they are mainstream. However keep up the hustle we love you man.
:D always makes my day.

I’m Italian and it takes me a month to grow that much beard.  Why?  I play bass. I slap.  It’s acoustic I have to slap.

Not only was it boring, it was also amazing.

The beard is here! If you let it grow all the way and that could take 5-6 weeks it will look even more AMAZING!
My dream is to see you and Julia from Thomann Music slap each other. Do it! Now!
No! That beard looks awesome! How to have a full set of beard like yours! Famous YouTubers have beard if you think about it! Stay humble and more success to you, tall man! Hehe

Please don't laugh. It made me sad.
Slapppppppp bass whit your beard
Even your bottom tier content is still 10 points higher on a 10 point scale than everyone else.
YT has sold out, in my opinion. Their algorithm favors Hollywood and corporations 😕 They snub independent creators. You got to love how quick they are to forget the people who built their platform in favor of the elite class and their money.
You know Davie is being serious when the "Stay Funky Bros" comes out :)

I SWEAR DAVID,, YOU ARE A VERY VERY SMART MAN!!! NO JOKE. I CAN JUST TELL BY THE WAY YOU CARRY YOURSELF. VERY INTELLIGENT. WHAT'S YOUR I.Q?? IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY DON'T YOU CHECK OUT AN I.Q TEST???? BUT THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO YOUR CHANNEL. ALWAYS MAKES MY DAY.
Beard Davie will be missed. Looking forward to the next SDAIAY that's all beard memes
YOUTUBE IS MESSED UP CAUSE THEY DONT WANT TO PAY !
I see you're really sick! : (   Since behind your back next to Bass, there is a GUITAR! HEAL US QUICKLY! PLEASE! O, yes - BEARD is EPICK!
F
Damn sora watches davie
F for the beard.
F
No wonder you have such an ease of reach on your fretboard being a person that is 6'7" tall, you have long wide hands and fingers! Ah-Haaaa! If you ever come to Toronto, Canada, check out Club Bass. They're an amazing Bass Boutique. You'd have so much fun and they have good coffee! 👍 SLAP!
Damn! You’re almost at 10million subs!
Davie, do you like dogs? There’s only cats  in your videos.  Stay healthy 💪
Keep it Bass Chad
F
davie: some musicians started off on yt like justin beiber also davie: shows shawn mendes
Davie404
If you watch his videos at 1.25x speed, he seems like a normal guy😂
F
nice beard you should keep it
f
You've been trying to destroy bass players from all around the world, now the world is fighting back.  Hang in there, bro, us Daves gotta stick together.
I subscribed, the hypnosis works.
You look BASS
subbed!
Bass Gear reviews? Would like to know what basses/strings/setups do you use.
You fitt a beard :)
wow real davie
F
4:35 I literally downloaded a reverse audio app just to see what he said there
I don't think the YouTube shorts have blown up the way Google wants them too. Tiktok is still a more popular platform for content of that length
❤️
Bruh david is born on the 5th of april and i am born on the 4th of april
Press B in the chat for BEARDY DAVIE
Where do you see yourself in 5 years:  DEAD
Davie is way too emotional, something happend.  i send my condolences in case he was not sick but lost his GF or anything worse...
F , bro I love you, kind we are all sad, but just know that you are out there hanging out trying to work, I dunno, just be fine a little too...
Slaffffffffffffff
6:41 *GYERÜNK MAGYAROK!* ☺
Thank you Davie!
keep your mustache and shave your beard
the people who disliked are piano player
Duh, tictoc has taken over from YouTube, it's what the kids are using now, they jumped platforms, only older people like me still use YouTube. Anyone under 20 uses tiktok or whatever it is a lot more, and obviously a lot of your subscribers have both apps, so why would they watch the same video on both platforms, anyway you probably know this and are just fishing for sympathy views but if you didn't think about it, there you go.
f
Do more episodes of BASS.
Can U do some Mariachi bass please?
Beards ALWAYS look very good. I wear mine since 1984. (With some cuts in the meantime.) Just slap it!
The DEADMAU5 "impossible bass" video inspired me to learn B A S S.  It remains my favorite demonstration by Davie.
u're very cool, Davie ⚡ thanks for your channel!
Davie504: Press F in the chat of this video me: pressing ffffffffffffffFFFFFFFFffffff (slapping F)
:)
Here is an idea to get to that 10mil mark. Go do what you set out to do in the first place? Do one of these videos and play bass in it…IN A CROWDED PUBLIC PLACE.
Noo
I just bought my first bass yesterday, inspired by you!
PS: I discovered your channel by my lover, who played bass too, and wanted to level up in slapping technics. 😉 We use to look at your videos together now, because: sometimes you make me laugh out loud, sometimes you relax me, and everytime you make me "WOOOOW!" 🤩 when I listen to you slapping every bass with so much talent, and passion. You are a very talented musician, with a "+": your caracter on YouTube is EPIC, unique, and you look good in videos. Don't let anyone make you think nothing else!  😎🖐💥... OMG! Did I slapped you?! 😉
Davie you are the shit man.  Stay positive and keep slapping.
Awesome beard
Stai meglio con la barba
I lov uuuuuuu
Stay healthy bro
i think david should be a rocker
Oh davi ma che combini,tutto bene? Io direi di tornare a la spezia,venire a Genova e farti due trenette al pesto❤️
I... I like the beard. Like, bro. Keep it, grow it
F
The beard looks good
Screw the statistics!  We all love you, and you've changed the world for bass players.  Beard looks good.
Davie, I love your videos, your music, and now, I love your BEARD 😎❤ (and TALL MEN). Be proud of you and your work. You deserve it. Good vibes on you and your lady! 🌈
I would love to see davie checkmate some NOOBS! Let's make it happen 😄
Seriously though don't shave
6.9k comments. Nice.
f
your videos are the one of a very few things that really makes me smile nowadays so unique and strangely mind-refreshing thank you for what you're doing be well, bro
Quit shaving dude
TL:DR  TikTok's algorithm doesn't give you a choice, but we prefer that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ - - - - - - - - -  I think the TikTok algorithm is "better" due to the way it shows you the content.  TikTok's main page is content right away. And if you like the video it just loops again after ending (no interruption) YouTube's main page is selectable content, meaning you need to make a choice of what you want to watch. Yes, there is the "shorts" option, but you still need to manually look for it and select one of the available shorts, again forcing us to make a choice. (And later obstructing the video with the "swipe up" message)
I like the beard bro
Chess 2... That caught me off guard, nice work. As always: Thanks, Davie.
I agree about exploitation of viewer ratings. You should play the star banner and torch the you tube bass.
Keep the beard!!! Become a bass Viking
Invite me in Pokémon Go!
you should collab with Kin Productions
F
<3
Get well soon bro and challenged me for a battle. Anyways your beard looks awesome better not to be shave. Love & support from Northeast India❤
Woohoo!! My country is the best !
F
Давид, привет! Слушай, не могу понять, ты говоришь на странном русском языке с итальянским акцентом. Понимаю слово через два.. Но тем не менее, ты довольно хорошо играешь. В чем секрет? Кстати, если бы не ты, то я бы не стал готовить себе баклажаны. Ты лучший! Ещё раз, Гордон Рамзи, спасибо тебе!!!
Dont shave again, the beard fits you nice.
F
beard davie i best davie
Can't wait for Chess 2!! 😄😄😄
F
F for the beard.
F and also you are awesome dude!! Love your videos 🤘🏽
Davie, i know being a youtuber automatically means that views and likes become part of your feedback of the community about your work. It is like you measure yourself and your works quality based on these figures, like you have said in an earlier video. But as you've tested with the short video, there are factors outside of your reach that impact the amount of clicks. Don't overthink it and don't start taking this personally, of course your financial stability relies on this; but remember you do not just have viewers, but people that you've helped with your videos and would always be there to have some therapy time for you as well. And btw: the beard was awesome.
😊 i laugh   🇲🇫   🌬️🍀
I like how Davie was gonna give someone a free bass for $1000. That’s so nice of him
how many people do you inspire? 2? well it's 3 now ... there are some times where i sit and stare at my bass , feeling stuck. watching your videos tends to rejuvenate that passion and that fire i had when i start and it keeps me going with it
always honest always entertaining!!!
I was going to buy another guitar, But I could not live with myself, having Davie in my head as I hover over the 'pay' button, Saying... " NOT approved! " So, I'm gonna buy BASS instead. Slap like now on this comment. Or I'll call the Police.
Doctor: ok whats you're Problem?  Me:I... think i fell in Love with a beard
davie stay funky we love you
F
F
Davie, are you in a band, if no why not? Do it, NOW. PS. Slap like now for Bald Davie with a beard reveal at 10M subs.
Can play a bass solo with your beard?
Davie looks like Eminem in the thumbnail.
3:50 Davie's hushed laugh is the most genuine thing I've ever seen from him, man it feels good to know you
When will you do a Pokemon Go ID reveal...??
EPIC!!!!!!
Glad to hear you're doing well Davie :D
Looks great!
Don't take the death poke!
About the beard... It makes your face look more like an oval shape which is what everyone want cause that's the "most perfect"... But you always look good no matter what. Love you bye
beard looks good  and i dont usually like them.     check out John Rose on you tube  re- health  ,  he is the best .   Bio -photons  baby  !    by the way i have a medical degree and am very knowledgeable regarding  natural and complimentary medicine  and diet and nutrition .  John Rose is awesome !
Hey bro, why don't you cover a bossa nova song? it would be really cool
F
Italian mustache reveal? 👀
Davie inspired me to play bass. The problem: If have no bass so I use the guitar bc I could never afford a 200$ or-so base :,)  help
Hope you feel better
davie make a chess bass video
Beard is not cool on your face
you have to remember what made you have a lot of subcribers, go back to the begining. but you already have almost 10M, you've done great for being a instrument channel. the easy way is to make a gameplay channel or a slut channel. but you have done incredible i think if you obsess with the number you are going to lose the spirit of Davie504. saludos
Keep it true and have fun 😁 Love from Brazil!
F
Dave you have to relax. You are tired of YouTube? You are famous, you have money, you are skilled: you won't be a loser or unemployed. You can start a band, a production studio (yes cause you are also a producer), you can really do whatever you want. So relax buddy and enjoy your life. Also because it is not healthy to be so focused on these tagerts like to reach 10 million subs. Stop thinking: you lose the empathy. Just do what you like and relax. Or all will seems to much artificial. You have none or nothing to justify. Do what you like and nothing else matters.
I like the beard it don’t look that bad
I literally screamed as I saw the beard.
F
sweaty underarm lol
fffff
F
Damn Davey you look sweet
3:14  Davie504 inspired meI! And I bought a Kala Journeyman acoustic-electric U-Bass. Evil ants dig graves and it doesn't stop there, great Danes are enormous.

Quiz who invented the art of SLAPPING in the bass: A) Larry Graham from Sly & the family Stone B) Stanley Clarke from Return from the forever solo and others C)Mark King from Level 42 D)Michael "Flea" Blazary from RHCP E)Les Claypool from Primus F)Davie504
why does my comment have a heart from davie?!😏🤫
1. Return the full black hair. 2. Keep the beard.  3. ??? 4. Profit.
LOL! "How to speak English properly and correctly?" Davie: "Using your mouth!". I laughed WAY too hard at that.
we love you Davie. Keep going!! You'll reach 10 Mil sooon :)
Everyone should hit like and help davie on the algorithm
2:05 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The beard looks great. Keep it!
When did Kenny Loggins start making bass videos?
Humans have a body and mind. Sometimes our body gets sick, same can happen to our emotions and mind. We need to take a rest to refresh our mind and refresh our emotions. Davie you are the best.

Q: how to speak english correctly  A : using your mouth ..  lmao.

Much love Davie!
I just love u, you (partly) inspired me to play bass, and you make me laugh in all of your videos, you impress me every time you play bass, and I just want you to know that whatever you  do, I will continue to follow you, take care of yourself ❤️
That beard wants Bass !
"SlAps ExTrA LiKe BuTtOn"
When I first subscribed, I watched your YouTube videos for hours.  You are hilarious, and an amazing bass slapper.  Lately my attention gets pulled in other directions, cuz I see so many interesting videos on my recommended list.  I'm not going anywhere tho - I am a Davie fan for life.  Also btw, your advice on how to speak correct English is SPOT ON - too many people talk out of their ass instead of using their mouth...amiright?
Why is there a guitar in the background davie504? delete guitar please
Davie504  bodat songong kau menyepelekan alif ba ta
"Slaps beard"
Your so cooool!
kind of looks like suicide bomber but without suicidal tendencies and no bombs. I approve.
Did you guys noticed that Davie was smiling when asked if he would still play bass even if it he doesn't make money? His love for bass is genuine.  Slap like this!
I liked beard davie

Hey can you play gratitude (amin toofani) on your bass 😂

Davie, I have a good video idea. I think you should make a slap bass competition (maybe a tournament?) and the winner gets a signed bass from you. Thoughts anyone?
F

Cara tú é o melhor !
Pewdiepie has 110 million subscriber but he gets views, somewhere between 2-5 million.. But you still get a million views.. Don't you worry davie, we love you. You gotta make videos for us!! All the very best in other platforms too.. And how is Yuuuu?? We love you davie and get well soon 🥰🥰
That quick break @3:50....LOL.  Davie, you're awesome.
It just a black screen ;(((
have you been to romania bass slayer?
i kinda like your beard actually 🤷🏻‍♂️ shame I can't grow one, still too young i guess
Do you like ice creams?
The sarcasm in his response thou😂😂😭😭💔
*This video was a legitimate cry for help to YouTube to fix their busted algorithm*
You really on drug
I used to watch YouTube all the time but most of my favourite channels got censored and deleted so I spend more time on other platforms now. That might be a reason why fewer people see your videos. I’ve just subscribed because I want to see you get to 10m 😊
I know your subscribers slowed down, but as I type this, this is #21 on trending. And you literally almost have 10 million subscribers following you, even if they don't watch every video, you have a community.  You have a cult
Respect level 420.
No " O M G " at the end of the video? 😳
This beard slaps man! 👍
wait that looks so cool
It's around 6 years or more since we got some Doom meet bass. Let's us see you catch up with todays heavy Doom / metal tracks. ;)

Try not to demand too much of yourself, being happy is more important than having 10M subs ;)

Beard looks good on you...but can you slap with a beard?  Of course you can but there are always skeptics. You should make at least one slap beard video.  Blindfolded, just to prove to the nay sayers I am right.

Davie, statistics aren’t everything. You’re an amazing person, and all you got to do is keep your head up and take life head on with your passion. The only way you can fail is by giving up.
Stay healthy David. There A LOT of us (including myself) who are loyal fans and would stay with you if you took a break. Thanks for another great video!
Look quite Italian ;)

with a beard, you don't look like you. a buddy of mine, all 4 of his grandparents are from italy, and we like to joke about it from time to time, but man... i almost thought you were him!
Nice beard
Your beard is amazing to be honest
I actually knew and Enjoyed davie because of his Bass performance, not the memes, reddit, or other content. I mean he's really good, he's the best in playing the bass. Other content are just additional reasons why I enjoy this Channel.  Keep Slapping Davie 🔥
you look good
Ayyyy a fellow Pokemon GO player. That's what's up. I have a huge PoGo community in my city
real davie
Please keep the beard
Do madonna, GET INTO THE GROOVE.
Internet shall break again (just like it did when PewDiePie revealed his transformation) as soon as Davie reveals HIS transformation since he started lifting weights.
The beard looks good Davie! Keep it 😁
im- 😳 the beard😳😭
10 million subscribers is an exaggeration of people. If you think about it, with only 10 thousand people you fill a whole concert.  be grateful for your luck friend. An exaggeration of people knows you and admire you.
like eminem
man... that was weird but necessary.
Good to change up your looks now and then
F. Bye beard. Very sad times😭

Stai bene con la barba Davie, e tutti noi vogliamo che tu stia bene. Un abbraccio dall'Italia  You look cool withour shaving Davide, and we all want you to be healthy and safe. Hugs from Italy
Davie, as i am writing this comment, your video has roughly 500k views. Thats 1 view per 20 subscribers. Meanwhile, last video from Pewdiepie has 2,2M views. Thats 1 view per 50 subscribers. Cosa? Your videos has better view per subscriber ratio than Pewds. Check Mate!
are you my real dad?

How to learn bass: Google: tune the bass and slowly learn Davie504: SLAP BASS
I have subscribed about 20 channels that I watch as soon as they post something new. Other 20 channels I have subscribed, I might watch if the new video seems truly interesting.  Less than half of the videos I watch are something I have not subscribed.  I really enjoyed this video, there's something really reassuring about a youtuber talking about taking some time off for health - a glimpse of sanity in the insane world the youtubers are part of. I think this video was REAL.
DAVIE’S TRENDING
I like the beard. 👍
Petition for davie to make a gaming channel
10 mil subscriber full naked body revealed.
You should watch the anime, Cowboy Bebop.  In the very least you should listen to the theme song, it has a sweet bass line.  It is, however, considered to be one of the best ever.
Better with the facial hair
I have great news for you: Chess 2 already exists. They even made a videogame version of it.
You look great with that beard, man!
I subscribe your channel only if you make a cover with bass of actarus shooting star!
Bye Beard 😢
Davie I am 10%. You are like a legend.
Long no Davie🥱🥱
"it's been a while since my last video" I watch technoblade, this is nothing
I'm actually surprised there are almost 10 million people in the world that care about bass guitar AND have the internet connection to watch videos 🤸
That was an interesting video :0

Hi

Davie looks handsome with beard
Oh my man, love your beard ❤️
a wise man said "lower your goals and succeed"...Peace
did you have covid, davide?
F
F  I mean, 🅱️ for the beard.  Also for no final OMG
When you reached your chad body goals, try to grow the beard again and let’s see how chad it would look like
Relax, 😁 , smoke a bowl, it will come to you. Think of Simon Gallop from the CURE. Have some fun. 😀
I’m a fan of the beard man
Thanks for the real Davie in this video. Nice beard. I slap F on my bass for you.

David504 can you play bass with your foot
6ft7.. You look tall, 84k 184lbs lanky, I know how it feels when people meet me for the first time at 6ft5 135-140kilo...  A lot of people think people lie about there height or weight on the internet... Then someone like us walks by.. Keep up the good work Davie and yes yt is a shitshow at best.
No "what's up slappers" ?
F for the beard
Health reveal at 13M subs
F
DAMNN BOIII, UR REAL PERSONALITY IS ATTRACTIVE, I WISH I COULD BE FAMILIAR WITH U IRL
Holy shit 😂
Two pieces of advice: 1. Keep the beard. It looks good. 2. Try not to focus too much on the fact that you haven't reached 10 millions subs, and focus on the fact that you already have over 9.5 million subs. That's amazing! Be happy with what you have and not sad about what you want. Easier said than done, I know, but it will really improve your mental health.
I really like your beard
Never thought id see davie with a beard

I’m one of the 90% of subscribers who don’t watch often anymore. My preferences changed over the year, but I still have fond memories of various David videos, so I’m not gonna unsubscribe.
what the flying heck davie can grow a beard?
F
I think your beard can be better with a BASS on it.
Davie - how can we cope with the immoral epidemic of people playing bass with a pick?

very sympathetic video! Enjoyed it!
Chess meet Bass video
Hi Davie, I wanted to let you know that, in May this year, I bought my first bass. I hadn't played an instrument in 14 years, but now I'm practicing at least 30 mins per day. It's not a lot, but I can already see some improvement. Thank you for inspiring your followers and don't worry: we like the meme-y content, but many of us can see the artist behind the youtuber
You look like a young and beardy bad bassist keep being funky
Beard Filter
Very impressive, but can you play something by Spock's Beard while you still have your beard? "Crack the big sky" has some some really bass lines from the beginning.

BUFF davie in the making. Davie da best, davie viva la vida!
Davie, here is an idea: how about asking for the youngest bass player and the oldest bass player to send you a video. I bet there is some old goat in a resthome somewhere who plays bass and I would like to see and hear the youngest bass player, 5 or 6 years old?
F for beard
2:36 bruh i laughed so hard

hay mate how you traveling the short stubble beard actually suits you glad to hear you are going to look after yourself. Better body = better bass playing longevity and we would like you to be around for between 69-420 years yet recently broke 2 strings on my guitar so been mucking around just playing with the 2 base strings and 2 high strings found your vids about a month ago and must say it was the final slap to make the decision to buy a bass if i can have half the fun you seem to have playing it ill be slapping out tunes after i get home from work every day keep up the good work looking forward to your next vid

Thanks for being real with us. Wishing you the best health. Get buff!
I'm a subscriber and I always watch your new video
Tbh I don't take (or have) the time to watch every video the day it is released. I propably would, when there is only one release per week. Atm I have to watch what I left out, at more fitting times. So for me, you really don't need to pressure yourself doing two videos per week.  But is just my opinion. You sure have a better view on how yt works, and what you need to do to get views... Just from this one fan: keep calm and do just how much you want <3 I really hope you can afford that.
keep the beard
Love u more videos like this??? I’m slapping wherever the channel goes, like hell you could live stream chess and I’d enjoy it
Dramas again …
You might have slowed down in subscriber growth from last year, but this is actually the year where I started watching your videos regularly. I eagerly anticipate them and watch them all the way through to the end.  You bring so much laughter to both me and my husband. Thank you for your amazing talent and raw honesty!

It’s tough having such a large following but seeing a decline in viewership or at least an in proportional viewership but don’t dwell on it too much. 300k that’s a lot of people. Don’t forget your roots

How about making a video of how to play bass badly where you make a song that the notes all sound terrible, kind of like unlearning all the music theory you know, but somehow the song still sounds catchy and has a good rhythm ?

Who's your favorite player in Italy football....?
Even Pewds, Jack, and Mark barely crack 2 million views per video. I also noticed that Mr. Beast is only getting around 36 million views per video when he used to get close to 60 million. I do think the Tic Tok type content from YouTube Shorts is hurting YouTube.

Will you make a review about cheap bass?
'its not like I ran out of idea' but 70% of your video follows the same pattern. 1. Slap Like 2. *** Reveal 3. Epic 4. Something bout paying the bills...  Davie, I still watch ur videos (*sometimes), i think you are an awesome bassist but ur content is because monotonous. Sorry😬 Please play more awesome bass and your truest fans will always slap the like.
Beard is temporary , screenshots are eternal
Here are some ideas Davie hopefully they can help 1 using the intentional stance to tell a story on the bass (basically our brains are really good at seeing emotion even just in shapes moving around, so you could do the same thing by having the strings each mean a different thing) 2 Playing the drums with me-- Davie504 I challenge to a drum off!! (You could still use bass though, as drums + bass = best friends)
I like Davie with beard more
Lol just realised we share the same birthday. We're basically the same person
Davie permission to buy a bass
i feel like i saw him omegle under “lgbtq” he was wearing a mask
f
The beard is better. No offense to your beardless face... (I’m in the same boat.)
You look like jesus
There was a bass in the room and he didn't play it
Come To Sebastopol and I'll buy you dinner !
If David504 like my comment, I will buy a bass and start learn it~
F
Seeing Davie with facial hair is seeing like Mario without it
Take your time davie. If you dont have enough time for creativity your quality will decrease. In my opinion its okay if you’ll release one video per week or less so that the videos‘ quality will be fine 👍🏼 stay funky bro 👊

Hi Davie, Good to see you again! Don't stress about writers block or feeling like you need a break. We will all still be here when you feel like uploading something :)) Take care of yourself
f
Your bass playing is exceptional, but it's really hard to listen to you talk. Its so monotone and just drones on and on. I really enjoy the videos most where you're actually playing bass and not rambling
5:51 i do the same thing but with my guitar
One more question, why you talking like a Lazy Bear😂
we miss your SDAIAY
Davie - the hard core is watching every fkn video and we will continue to slap like and force friends to subscribe. We will always support you ♥
dont shave it! cuz BEARD means [B]BASS [E]AROUND [A]THE [R]WORLD with [D]AVIE

Beard shaving reveal
The beard makes you look like PewDiePie lol
Love was a man who was nailed through his Wrists & Feet into a cross before that he was whipped & beaten and wore a crown of thorns, he committed no crime or sin,but he loved you so much he made a way for us sinners to come to repentance through Jesus! his blood was paid to use for our sins, for those who believe in him & who receive them as their Lord & savior, his name is  Jesus Christ! Do you know him? † He loves you so very much! Also remember Death couldn’t hold Jesus  down! God rose Jesus Christ up from the dead on the third day! Jesus defeated death! Jesus is alive & retuning back one day soon, are you ready to meet him? 🙌🏻🖤
I think you have done this before but you should learn suggested songs from fans

"I can't wait for Chess 2"
Take care Davie, I like all your videos and you are the best bassist..  looking for your next one ❤️
davie, you look hotwith the beard, i feel like i wanna tell you to spank me an d call you daddy, youre thebest davie405 ily
Davie504 doesn't shave with a razor. He removes his beard by holyslapping himself ✋🏼
my first bass comes tomorrow
Stay bearded, Bro
I like the beard honestly, you have very nice facial hair pattern: even, symmetrical, there's plenty of it. You should consider embracing dem italian genes thru the beard, man.
*I cant wait for 'chess 2' either*
F
Good choice to start lifting! If you didn’t start with something like Starting Strength I would highly recommend it. It is much more efficient than random messing around with machines and such.
Another excellent video.
F
keep that beard pls senpai
Pokemon go hell yeah! What team are you? Team Mystic? You seem like a Team Instinct guy... Just curious.

F
Bye beard
wish you always be healthy, people!
Like... Justin Bieber 🤣👌
F
Love you Davie
Wait, WHAT?!? No "OMG" at the end?!? I am forever scarred.  :(
I am one of the 90% who subscribed for years but not watching any videos, i left playing bass for years but dude, i still love bass
when sora the troll gets  recognized, thts bassed
F
You want more views? Bring back your girlfriend. I know she's super-shy but tell her to take one for the team. And tell her I love the vids on her channel with the two of you walking around Taiwan.
wow nice bread
Keep the beard! It looks really good on you man!
I was waiting for the omg......
First time here. Gotta ask, what's the draw ? How does this clown get a billion f'n subs?
I really enjoy your content Davie, percussion-bass unity
🧔‍♂️
"Chess 2", I can't wait!  Seriously though, aside from being an ace bass player, you are funny, and have a good sense for video production. Stay well!
he look like shroud.
I usually check out Davie's channel and smile when the new video with hilarious thumbnail... but this time I couldn't help myself worrying about you. Davie! I just want to say, health is first and then some. Please, be safe... :)
Two weeks straight a beard grows
Dont shave please, No shave challenge till 11 million
Have you given your opinion on the late Louis “Thunder thumb” Johnson of the group Brothers Johnson? I believe he did the bass for Michael Jackson’s Thriller. When I need a dose of funk, I turn to the Brothers Johnson.
F
I don't know if someone said it already, but you said you like playing games. It's common, but i would like to see you playing some games sometime, even if it's from time to time.
F
Italians be like.
Woah
Davie looks like an Italian version of wadzee
Beard chan...no.....😭
F for beard davie
How you have that thicc of a beard and aren't a Manscaped partner is a lost opportunity. What kinda razors do you use? Asking for a friend.
chess 2 already exists Go buy it
Hi Davie, take care of yourself mate.
The thing with youtube is that there are ALWAYS up and comers who catch people's attention, so after you've binged everything from a certain channel you eventually get drawn to the next big thing. I'm subbed to so many channels that it's impossible to keep up with everybody. I try my best, but it's just not realistic. So I'll try to binge as much as possible from time to time from all my favorite channels.
Davie504 please read NOW davie u seem very stressed out and that's ok it happens but still making youtube videos isn't the best idea please take a break I also heard u started working out I also work out a lot personally and it really big helper when you need time to chill with ur thoughts also I'll give u some advice if you want mucelses do ur research on bulking it helps with that hope ur doing good and.......I love you in a totally non gay way
F
you look good, bud. take care!
"Send me 1000USD dollars, I'll send you a free base. Deal!"  "Can't wait for Chess 2"  F

Love you Davie504. Please make a video about what bass styles the different jedi would play. I think Mace Windu would SLAP
Davie504 gaming playthroughs incoming.
Pokemon Go? Yay, hope you are in the team Valor. I'll leave my code, just for fun  4729 9295 2678
The beard/stubble suits you, Davie
I don't think the scruff makes you look older. My 17 year old has a full neck beard. Hasn't quite got the shaving frequency right haha. So one week he's m'lady, and next is holy shit you have a chin.
Keep beard. It starts with B. Like BASS
Davie, please take your time and get better. We all love you and support you. While we wait, I call my fellow slappers to press like on your video. And to press 🅱️ for 🅱️**s 🎸
Bald Again
F for beard
You know Megadeth is in need of a new bassist Davie.
He Davie, today is my birthday, you made my day with your sensual beard
Dude, you can totally rock a beard.
F
Road to 10m Davie you look like shroud with beard.
I noticed the way the YouTube app recommends videos is weird! If you subscribe to a channel it starts to recommend videos of similar channels, but not really the videos of the channel you subscribed to. Also, I think it’s because most people just check the home and ignore checking the page with the contents they subscribed to, so if your videos are not shown in the home, they don’t see them.
I watch nearly every video of yours Davie!  You bring a groundedness to my life,  I can't explain. Hope you get feeling better Brother.
F
Hey Davie504, where would you like me to send the thousand dollars for the bass.  I have been going through many things lately and have been using as many creative mediums as possible.  It can be hard for me to make intricate decisions when I know that I accept the initial idea.  So any advice on what bass options would be good for a beginner slapper would be great.  I will gladly accept a free bass of your choosing, if you would give me the name of where you want the 1000$ and I will transfer the USD.    I appreciated the offer, and understand if you have changed your mind.  I do not know how to send a direct message, but you said you read all your comments so I posted this here.    Thanks for helping me slap a guitar low E string, it makes a cool sound as well sometimes.  You are very inspiring, and great educational entertainment. Alex
Cool beard
Hey Davie. I think if you could play some famous songs on bass, like covers, it will be very amazing and maybe you can get some subs.   Dude you are amazing. I still love you
4:24 sora the troll
Take good care of yourself big man
vid quality is good enough . btw u may want to check this bassist :   Iqeen Queen
dont shave it nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Appreciate little things David and just do what makes you and/or your friends and family happy. You can rest and focus on what really matters in your life, then if you lose this whole YouTube gig, so what?
Davie, maybe ur channel is growing slower than last year because covid quarantine meant a lot of people were watching more of your videos. It could be nothing to worry about:)
shavie504
i missed watching you davie, I have dropped from youtube, but now that I remembered this site exist I will watch every video that you release, luv U
YOUR BEARD LOOKS AMAZING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH keep it pls
I'm surprised that I didn't get slapped by him today

F

I stay funky and I stay wirh you. I love your videos and you inspire me ❤️
nice beard
Do you have a pick up set up you really like? And how do you set your tone to get that good slap sound?
F. Bye beard. I don't know about everyone else, but I really like the music only videos.  It would be great if there was some platform someplace you could release the wonderful music you make so that I could, you know, purchase it :)
I love davide biale new looks.
F
Davie with a beard is cool
What part of Congo are you from?

The beard is a good look for you - you should keep it..
Do a one take video. You have too many cuts... i think.
F

F
Davie just unlocked puberty with the beard.
I like beard Davie  Like if you too
F
hes look more italian with that beard
Honestly tho, you could just go on the extreme and leave the beard on with a little clean up. Lookin old and clean isn't a bad thing.
F
With your creative style it would be amazing to hear you play with pedals.
I try to watch all your videos Davie, keep cool and slapping :D
Hahahaha
Keep the beard, it's in line with being a rockstar...

Davie could let his beard grow until 10 million subs. That would be cool

Italian mafioso face reveal 👍
I don't mean this as an insult at all. But something tells me Type O Negative toured in Italy around 1994 and your mom was a big fan! The resemblance is uncanny...
Forgot you existed  Nice to see you're doing well
Press F to Beard
I, for one, think the beard is good. Just my opinion, though.
Bye beard. F.
Will your face gets broader if you dont wear headphones that’s squeezes your head???

Dang u look better with a beard
Davie with beard hits different.
F
Who this🧐🤔
I have an idea. Deuling bajos, But on BASS
I’m recommending an anime Jojos bizarre adventure
Hello Davie! Greetings from Brazil... Add me on Pokémon Go :) Slap it now
Hey who is this bearded man. Where is davie?
Davie really changed much from last time i've seen his videos
Hey Davie504, I love your videos and watch them obsessively, even my kids love them.  I'm a 25 year guitar player but had found myself tempted to try bass a few times in recent years but never gave it a go until I found your awesome videos. Given how inspirational and influential you have now become is it possible you can make videos giving lessons to your followers. Also, given your disdain for guitar players you should put more effort in on helping those you have converted such as myself on how to play a bass such as what makes a good groove and how to "think" like a bassist when you've spent years thinking like a guitarist which is a completely different mindset. Any thoughts on 5 string vs 4 string and what the best bass features are for slap style are?  I'm using a Washburn 4 string with EMGs and find slapping the A, D snd G strings sounds weak as compared to the E string.
Ok, he look strange whit beard
Beardie 504
I actually kinda dig the look. Wouldn't go full-on beard, but that little bit of scruff actually looks really good on you.
Plz speedrun minecraft using a bass

The beard looks good on you tho!
Davie, subs are important, but you're far more important to the journey of the Bass than is reflected in your subs. You're becoming part of the history of the instrument.

F for Davie’s beard
Honestly tho as yes your no beard face is part of your look, I personally really dig it

Gaming channel reveal 10M subs??
Beard Davie looks completely different. Maybe you should try this new look for awhile.
You look Like Tony stark💖😁✌️
I almost fell out of my chair when I saw Davie's facial hair! Fuckin sick man! Great look
How about a busking tour? Pick a continent, buy a car & phone there, be straight edge,  rubber tramp city to city, country to country, play gigs, open for and join your fans' bands at gigs, continue to shoot weekly videos but from libraries, civic centers, labor halls and gyms,  help friendly homeless travelers and experiment with road and live show cinematography and sound challenges, free strange and unusual people and cultures from routine, help people hear their environment in relation to music, allow travel to be muse and bass to fight mediocrity of safe, play open air shows, and at landmarks. Keep a ticket home in your pocket. Couch, camp grounds, and hostel surf til you gotta get home for a real pizza. Ever seen a Fjord?
Awesome 👏 🍻
Just throwing this out there, but a bass battle with Alex Moukala would be an amazing idea for a video!
Foreal tho the bass around the world vids are dope. The Japan one was really good, I haven't returned to a video like I've been returning to that one in quite awhile. And then Mina posted a vid highlighting a little bit of the process behind the scenes, which was REALLY cool
Would love to atleast see one let's play video from you.
Davie looking like Rico Rodriguez
I just realized there is yet another BASS challenge that Davie504 must add to the list! We have all seen the many EPIC types of BASS's that you have played but you must add a 4 string BASS with a wammy bar!!! Les Claypool plays one and it is very epic, but the world waits for Davie504 to set the all time challenge of slapping the 4 string whammy bar dive bomb BASS!!! OMG! Do it now.
Davie plays Pokemon Go? Whoa.
Not Justin Beiber 🤓
Still waiting for alip ba ta
LOL, man, I almost spit my wine out: “how do you see yourself in 5 years?”  “Dead.” Hauehaheuaheguwehheushshahaha
Davie becoming a Chad
F
"Shortly after..."  -- I see what you did there ;-)
I did not type that comment
lookin good with the beard bro, you should grow it out and see how it looks :D
Do you have friends? I didnt think so.
make it 3, you inpired me to play bass, thanks davie :D!
Wait just one minute. When did you replace your headcans? The pads don't look........ crunchy.
If you ever feel down and unsure just remember that you single handily created a YouTube channel all about the Bass that has reached nearly 10 Million subs! That's an incredible achievement, especially as music content is harder to boost than channels that ride the wave of larger content creators ideas/trends. I love what you do and watched your content whilst hospitalised with Cancer last year during the pandemic to cheer myself up. So stay strong, stay funky,  keep slapping that bass, and RIP to the beard (which I think suits you!) :)
Slap like now!👋
I Kinda Like The Beard But You Can Shave It

Is Davie ok? I mean, it's a serious question. I understand tha he has a lot of pressure with YouTube numbers and stuff so would be nice if we could help him with that.
🇮🇹
Reddit: Petition for Davie to don't shave The actual video: (well, what else were you expecting to see?)
Davie: We're gonna have some emotional music  Emotional music: 1:53
Stay healthy Davie, a lot of people need you to have fun and have happier days now and then. Mad respect for taking that time for you.
I wish everything will b ok davie   Coz i need bass

I'd love to hear some metal bass lines from you
Davie, mi dispiace davvero tanto che il tuo canale non stia andando molto bene in questo momento, ovviamente sono sicuro che migliorerà. prenditi tutto il tempo che ti serve. capita a tutti di non avere più idee.   ti voglio bene davie
5 years? With you.
My pop music is beneath your talent. You are the ‘honey badger’ of Bass.
F hahaha
F
Would you like some advize, Davidada Bee-ally??? IF, and I mean IF...you decide to grow it out (and you really should at least ONCE in your life just to let the follicles mature fully) then make sure....and I mean MAKE DAMN SURE, that ANY time you have to blow your nose you’ll have a mirror nearby! I’m just sayin’.....😳.  😎🤘🔥👏

I like these vids buddy
Release a cover album
Davie with a beard is like pineapple on a pizza
Keep the beard my guy
Davies beard game is strong
F for the beard. Ciao
Here's a thought...why do you feel like you have to keep going? Why not at 10 million subs quit caring about what you think others want to see and just upload whatever you feel like uploading...your true fans will stay, the ones that shouldn't be here in the first place will go and you can stop worrying about producing content that "everyone" will like. I mean how long are you going to keep worrying yourself like this...is it worth it? I dont know how financially well off you are but I would imagine someone with 10 million subs and millions of views on his videos would be able to live modestly for the rest of their life on what they make...am i wrong? I mean i make 30 thousand a year as a postmaster...do you make more than that? Say 50,000 a year, do you make that much? Thats plenty of money to be able to live on. Do this youtube thing part time, only making the content that you want to put out, have that pay the bills and put it on the back burner. Point being, when is enough enough? 20 million..50 million? Most people could never do what you've done...you've made it man...your somebody...you should have no regrets...quit worrying so much, screw what people think, and find you a woman..get married..have some kids..and enjoy the rest of your life. God bless you brother...Michael.
the beard makes you look extra italian

dont stress over 10M subs, seriously, its not worth the health stress
Not good beard
Davie with beard is ugh....
"Hi"  Im scared  I wanna say I NEVER saw "Uh so basically" It never appeared for me
The boring video Davie is watchable
Not before we get blond beard Davie

Davie mentioned it a couple times in this video already but the youtube trends are a bitch. They pressure youtubers into conforming to a certain length of video, release schedule, and type of meme-y, click baity content. I'm sure a lot of Davie's fans would appreciate whatever content Davie wants to produce and release if that differed, but it's not practical when you're actually trying to be popular on youtube. I'm sorry that that's the reality and I hope you take a much needed break for yourself! Stay well, peeps <3
I’m not getting over this, you can’t tease running in the 90’s!!!!
F
Keep beard!
davie, it's ok to take a break. there are plenty of other things you could do. i believe in you.  im a painter, i used to sell painting online regularly, but over time the algorithms and flooded market means i rarely sell paintings now. it is weird to think about; the content does matter, but also it doesnt. do what you enjoy, only way to be healthy.
F
Haha
F
Hay Davie please don't retire when you hit 10, mil I know you want to take a break from youtube but I just don't want to see my favorite YouTuber leave like coryxkenshin HECK everyone doesn't want that to happen
What's on your workout playlist?
2021 Davie504 keep the beard challenge
man i don't watch every single one of your videos, but this one made me tear up a bit. you were the one inspiring me to start playing bass. well, you and Mike dirnt. but i remember coming home after school, sitting on my bed with my bass, and watching your old videos, trying to learn a few stuff. i really admire your love for bass. and i wish things here in yt get better, cuz you're a really nice person and deserving of more genuine attention online. i love your videos, and i love the more "serious" you. hope you're doing great Davie! we love you!
Shroud looking different in this video 🤔

Why is there a guitar in the background?
8:03 is not youtube fault, I saw the thumbnail's video in recommended but I never watched it cause I don't usually like videos like those
I love it when I see your real personality online since you act in most of your vids I never really got to see it but its a good thing your doing well on your physical health but do the same for your mental health Davie.

Great😬

Good answers 😁
Bird reveal..
Yo Davie looks good with scruff
F for 🅱️eard
GENIOOOOOOOOOOO
F
Will you compose any bass pieces?
I enjoyed the video
Hey Davie. Since you're running low on ideas, why not try doing a breakdown of popular songs/music? You can point out interesting features of a song you notice, maybe show how it would translate onto the bass. Or you can do a medley of game songs on bass. Another idea is showing the process/behind the scenes of making bass solos or covers. Love your videos and I hope you continue to enjoy making them
F
I want to see bald with beard Davie xD
OMG... I wasn't expecting to see his armpits like this 8:31
Davis can slap my bASS with that beard 😳
😢 You play Pokemon ... can we get a "Playing Pokemon On Bass" video

I want "real personality video 5 through 20" all in one video.
Yey!😭💕

I enjoyed this video.  I enjoy your humor in your videos, but I also enjoyed you not being “Davie504.”  You’re an entertaining guy, and a killer bass player.  You keep doing what you want to do, and folks will watch.
For what it's worth I think people's interest comes and goes. I used to watch all of your videos the second you released them last year, then there was a period where I stopped watching them, for no real reason, then now I'm back to watching every single video. Keep it up Davie and play the long game!
4:23 epic crossover here
@Davie504, why not more cooking?
Wait, your favorite country is NORTH KOREA?!
Con la barba sembri fabrizio corona
It looks great Davie!
Hey bro you haven’t uploaded much lately. If you are burned out creatively here are some ideas for videos I would like to see. It would be cool to see you do a series where you take songs you really love that have mediocre bass lines and write your own bass line for it and let us see the end result. If you have contact with other famous bassists a series where collaborate on some kind of bass duets with people would be cool, or even something like what Jared Dines did where you get all the best bassists to write a bass line for a song. The Omegle videos are also really fun to watch. Just some suggestions. Keep up the good work man.
Omg seeing you with a beard makes me feel old lol
F
Just let it grow a little longer, that's all I ask😭😭

Loved this content a ton. Keep it up Davie!
Yes YT is messed up for sure.... I feel for you, man. But i tell you what i love getting a glimpse of the real you from time to time. It feels more special with you because your almost always in character.   You'll get there Davie. Keep it up man!!! And hey there are other platforms out there to get famous on too!! 10Mil will come!!

That's a real personality reveal... Coming soon a video without edition. Davie504, you inspired me to create videos... I do something completely different. Your humor is so unique, the most amazing videos are where you do collabs, and fiver series.
Very impressive. But can you grow "the Mario"?
youtube is a mess. and they dont seem to care a whole lot about their content creators
The day we find out the accent is only a prop for the YT channel persona....
F! Huahauahauahjaha
Bella Davie, non ti stressare troppo e riposati. Noi ti vorremmo sempre bene. Stay funky bro!
Afro hair reveal
UPVOTE SO DAVIE WILL SEE HE NEEDS TO KEEP THE BEARD!
Epico!
Real personality reveal 6 at 9.8m subs!
Can the beard play bass too?
You are incredibly attractive with facial hair.
AHHHHHHHHHHH
sad time s F
I love the music videos and challenges. It would be cool to see you branch out to other styles and techniques in them. Some of the comments on the video with Olugbenga Adelekan were really mean (and a few racist) and I think in part because for some people all they know is your (incredible) slap technique and not many others.
Only cowards shave their beard.
*HOLY SHIT WAS THAT A SMILE AT **3:51** I SAW!?*
Hello Davie
Whats the longest bass solo...in the universe?
Can’t wait for chess 2 😂😂😂 Keep the beard btw
It would take me two months to grow that beard.  F
Beard looks amazing
You should keep the beard, there is a basist place open at ZZ top. R.I.P Dusty Hill
YO, davie how about a break at 10 million?
What do I think of your beard?  Makes you somehow look even more Italian.  Now I need to hear you say "I am Davide Biale di Firenze 🤌.... Requiescat en pace. 👏  Assassino, assassino!" 😁
Do  you   always     talk this    way, I like the   way    you       talk  mmakes me laffff h  a     hhh    aaa haha a...........
Davie Vs mohini dey bass battle!
Hey Davie,  Thank you. It's ok to be genuine. It's ok to act mature sometimes. You don't always need to be funny, but you always are full of personality.  This episode is very honest, and honesty is the best policy. I hope you have some therapy time of your own and get the rest you need. This is a tough job, it's ok to take a break sometimes and take care of yourself. We love you, and you continue to do what you love and follow your dreams and goals, maybe even find some short term goals to look for.  Love the beard BTW, hope you enjoy the smooth shave after the video. Stay funky bro.
For the next B A S S video do you think you could do one for Canadian bassists? I am one myself and it would mean a lot if you did one
The beard reveal is cool and all, but you look really tired, Davie...
Someone should have asked why 504
Your videos are awesome dude. Getting more serious about working out has done wonders for my mental the past year and a half, wish you all the best man
Damn but davie looks pretty good with a beard. Handsome ass
Your English improved

Davie: Pit stain reveal NOW!!!
That is an insult to beards, but keep working on it You can see my beard from 3 feet away in that picture of my fretting hand, im definitely slapping
Its look cool bro..keepsafe bro
F
Emotional times when he said no more beard videos
You should keep the beard. It looks amazing.
I don’t miss SDAIAY, but I do miss Therapy time. Could you incorporate it into another video?
I do love these types of videos as well as the memes, I have a question too, Davie, do you think you'll upload any bass tutorials in terms of different slapping techniques including your own?
Made spaghetti carbonara for dinner tonight. Wise choice.
Creepy lol
Glad to hear you have taken a vacation - well deserved❤️
You're awesome Davie.  I hope you really are doing well.  Stay funky bro
Change things up and take some time off if you are stressed. And yes, YouTube is assho!
Where is the Bass? No Bass here.
3:17 *3
Stay safe davie. Hope you are doing ok.
That beard is very impressive. Fits you well
6'7!?
You look so unshaven 🥵🔥
I appreciate him sharing about his life, lately his character has become too much
plot twist: he is davie504's brother, davie505
Take a COVID test
I would love to see you play video games!!
You should really have vacations Davie, you've been uploading videos regularly through out this years and we appreciate you. The part when you talk about wanting to play videogames and relax thinking that maybe you are being lazy is a symptom of stress, but is not just simple to relax because in the back of your mind are the things that you have to do for youtube and your daily life. Try to improve the situation somehow and if you need to stop we'll be here waiting for your return. Take care
F
Just slap the beard off. Save time and a razor. PREGO!
it's been one year since a watched a video of yours I think and I just got this in my recommendations
Eff
You’re a cool person and it’s normal to have a creative writing block after a while. Keep on! PS: Still, we need another SDAIAY :/
Great beard work
Davie looks like daddy Davie where he has like 2 children
nice beard and hair cool
You're so weird with beer
0:00 hi
i think it’s actually quite good that davie’s talking videos are more popular, it shows that the fans love davie for davie, and while the bass video views may be smaller, there is still an audience that enjoys them, like fucking e ve for christ’s sake
I watch davie's talking videos once, but I watch his bass only videos 2 or 3 times.
Davie, youre a nice guy. Tell your girlfriend to give you a kiss from me.
F
Just found Davie504 a couple day’s ago, this dude cracks me up! You got another subscriber for that diamond bass!
I'm a subscriber and I watch 90% of your videos
Press F everywhere
Davie: my favorite country that I have visited is your country me from a country that Davie never visited: *confused screaming*
There will always be time for YouTube. We love you Davie and will always search for a video when we don’t see you upload. If you take care of you, your subscribers will take care of the rest. We want that diamond play button bass probably more than you at this point. No pressure. Much love. Stay funky.
Your beard looks great

Hi Davie. I've been watching your monster  bass playing for  a while now. Not just slap bass either. I see you are not feeling well so I thought I would  share my health tip with you. I just  turned 71 on Aug.6 by the way. I take 2 little vitamin D3 pills and 1 aspirin size zinc citrate pill every day. That's it.  I get lots of sun. I see you do too. I eat well. I see you do  too. I exercise every day. I see you do too. There you are, Now I have to learn bass. I can't  learn to play as well as you but that's OK. I am still am healthy. I don''t have as many subscribers as you but that''s O.K.too.  I still am healthy.  I slapped that button too. Thanks.
Keeeeep the beaaaaard ! Honestly it suits you so well !

That beard must stay!
Unlock better with this beard
For when davie is stressed, he should watch “therapy time” usually made by Davie504 (what coincidence for same name) they really help me and i think he should try it too someday
You are awesome! Just watched your 9mil video and it was great, you crack me up! Thanks for sharing a portion of your life with us viewers, you are helping more people than we’ll ever know.
Stay funky Bros  F for the beard, you could do a long goatee tho!
Video Idea: keep beard and make beard content just like when you went bald.

Nice beard, Davie.
Next up: Shaving reveal!
I started playing bass because of you Davie...
The beard is alright The end of this video have a really nice and sweat spot
Nonsense, I love the bass only videos, I usually watch them more than the talking videos
A bearded Davide Biale? Checkmate, society
i'm glad you enjoy my county Slapping ASS
you look sabroso
Maybe it is time to start streams on Twitch?
Beard
You heard it here, folks. Davie’s favorite country is the United States of America. He looked me in the eyes, pointed at me, and told me.
F
looks pretty great the beard man. keep it
6 foot 7?! No wonder your hands are massive
The beard looks good on your face, it’s just perfect, what about making the goatee style beard?

Grow it out davie
Buon Agosto Davide!

Looks tight 👊🏽
Hehe I SLAPPED like on the only video when davie has a beard
You sweat a bit while making this ;)
fun fact: i always remember to slap like when he says slap like now
Am I the reverse Davie? 90% of my views are not submarine sandwiches... But also most of my sandwiches don't watch either I guess...
F
wow! you look like Jack Barakat from All TIme Low with that beard!
keep the beard!!
*F*
He looks so cool
Davie laugh aaahhhhh
Nice job 👍🏽
I have no musical talent whatsoever and love this channel
Nice video davie hope your doing well
We had bald Davie.... Now it's time for hairy Davie
It's not you Davie, it's Utube, they have become so woke and have upset so many people with censoring videos that don't agree with their warped view of society that a lot of people are just not using the platform as much.  If I want to watch kittens play with a ball of string in the International Space Station I should be able too! To hell with it not being multi cultural enough or upsetting the Llamas, the two legged ones not the four legged ones. Geesh the world has become a weird place.
I devote most of my time to the guitar, and at some point I started watching your videos and I can say that they helped me raise my English level and inspired me to master the bass, so thank you very much for the video and your existence
please go on a tour!!!! <3 <3. CYKA
F
"it's cool to see there are real people behind those numbers". the story of being famous via social media/internet
Davie ya look great with the beard but you gotta do you. If you don't like it, go ahead and SLAPP it off. Stay healthy please.

Stay funky bro.

6'7  185 lbs 😲 Davie is a basketball player 🤯
Yo Davie, I'm glad I found your channel. Fellow Bassist here too respect 🤟🏻 Try just a soul patch. It gave me a Funk Boost. Not saying you need a boost and it may not work but any chance to unlock Bass Super Saiyan God... I'll take it!  Stay Fresh
Davie do NOT. SHAVE. THE. BEARD. It is a beast on its own  Might help with slapping, you never know 🗿
7:20 Society has trained people to be dumb. We look, but many do not see you. They ONLY see memes. Some of us DO see YOU. By you I mean the man behind Davir504. I can see and hear your frustration. Stay being the funky, eccentric, and intelligent person you are!
Beard is perfect, SMASH LIKE IF YOU AGREE
Question: Favourite bass that you own? Also, would you ever buy a MicroBass?
DAVIE MAKE A NEW Q&A AND MAKE THE FIRST QUESTION how many bass guitars do u have
F
S L A P P-liked because of the beard.
Davie needs to keep his facial hair tbh. It suits him
Davie you should try going onto Omegle with your Slapping Base Skills
Beard looks amazing
U look cool
Chad Davie504?
Honestly I know he plays a character but the amount of small smiles in this video really brightened my day.
Chess... 2!  hahaha good one Davie!

8:33 Me: 0_0 Davie: What? Being honest makes me sweaty!
Davie504: It never was about the money, it was about the bass!
Davie looks even better with a beard
This video is number 666 🤘Satan reveal at 10m subs. What about doing a behind the scenes making of a Davie504 video. I think people enjoy seeing your real personality and I also think people would appreciate seeing how much work goes into creating your bass videos.
I've watched you for many years now but this is the first video of yours I've had show up in my feed this year...and it's freaking August.
keep the beard 👍
battle w/ davie503 when
What is italian reaction when Valentino rossi announced his retirement?
Pokemon Go Friend Code Reveal at 9,69 MILLION SUBS!!!!
Davie...you're much smarter than the majority of your viewers.
4:20 Sora’s comment… of course it’s at this time 😂
Beard Davie is the saddest Davie
Rock the beard Davie!
Question:  What do you think of the cast and crew of Mystery Science Theater 3000 suggesting that a defining trait of Italian men is wearing womany sunglasses?  Is it completely wrong of them even though it's somewhat justified considering that their exposure to Italian fashion was via cheesy movies from the eighties?
I really dig the bass playing videos. Please don’t stop doing those!
"Answering to serious questions about my health: beard reveal!"
I have a question. Do u think u can play an acoustic bass? That would sound funky
Davie, looks like you need some therapy time...take care of yourself buddy, stop worrying too much about youtube for a while
I'm really impressed by the fact that when you get up you become taller.      Incredible.
F
The beard is ok. Does not make you look older
Davie, bad times will pass , and believe me for most those times right now are really bad , easily the worst summer ever...
Guys, he's 190cm tall.
tRendiNg?
KSI seeing Davie's beard be like:
Davie, you shave the beard - you not get 10M subs!
I love your videos. please make more meme videos even though I will watch everything you upload
SO SHOCKING: there is no OMG at the end :(
F
....slap
F
Hi davie. I love you. Great to see you :)
slap that beard
I love the bass playing, but the personality is really why I come here.
Get well soon and slap that illness
F
Lovin the beard but if ya don't like it you do you vro!!
F
Davie!  Davie!  Davie! Perhaps you've done it before, but maybe there are bass guitar manufacturers that you could visit to see the craft and demo their product.  That would make for interesting content.
you should grow a beard for longer
f for the beard
No omg?
F
F.  Can't even grow beard. Big F.
Beardie504????

Be well brother...
F
Stay healthy, bros

I'm watching you for several years, and it's kinda inspiring looking how u upgraded yourself and your channel. Proud of Davide Biale aka Davie504. U r the coolest.
Stupid YouTube, your bass vids are the best, I usually play the new ones on repeat
Hello! Just discovered your channel, and it's been really an inspiring experience. Hope you reach 10mi subs and much more, because you deserve it, you are an amazing musician an I do love your youtube persona, I identify with it. BTW, we have the same birthday, cool.
I’m a relatively new sub, but am trying to do my part by watching all of your videos… which are my favorite thing EVER on Youtube!
hey Davie 283391139711 I send present every day ;)
dude, keep the beard and im totaly fine with 4k tbh :D

You look freaking badass with your beard tbh
It's just my imagination? Or this video really felt kinda sad?
When are going to marry your girlfriend? You make a lovely couple 💑
dude the beard looks dope, keep it
This video was kind of depressing, but I also liked it because of seeing Davie being himself
Real personality is not having "OMG!" at the end of the video :( feels bad man
STREAM GAMES ON TWITCH
F
You can work as a session/touring bassist in the musical industry.
F
Don’t allow this moment of vulnerability affect your judgment.  Keep up the good work of proliferating the slapping community. Best wishes!!
beard is good.
it’s so nice to know you a little more.. i like that you’re very honest answering the questions😊 stay safe always davie💕
f
What do I press for beard in the chat? 🧔🏻
That QnA wasn't boring. It was just true QnA. I like it.
F
f
Davie you should definitely grow the beard out for at least another 3 weeks, you’re gonna look like an absolute chad😂
F
This is the most important question everr Do you have another source to earn money next to youtube?
F
What do you use to shave. I’m trying to do a magic trick w my beard and make it disappear with no razor bumps. Slap the reply button Davie504
You’re a cool person and it’s normal to have a creative writing block after a while. Keep on! PS: Still, we need another SDAIAY :/
I love the beard. I wish it was here to stay 😞
Davide! Hope you’re OK, you look pale, like pizza bianca, without the sunshine of pineapple … stay strong, be well, slap bass
Ciao Davide
I also can't wait for Chess II
Davie, grow the beard like Leland Sklar.
Your stellar Q & A made me realize something. I watch all your videos, and never slap like. I'm so ashamed. Please forgive me!
Genuine guy
F
F
i’m on the opposite lol when i started watching your videos (you don’t have to stand) i knew you were very tall  XD
Keep the brd
I liked the beard
Pareciera que necesitas un abrazo!! te mando abrazos desde CBA!!!
Do you have a favourite bass Davie??
f
I watch all the videos... I would say, "Send bass now please," but I do not have $1000 to send to you.  Plus, my arthritis would probably make learning to slap impossible.
Italian Tony Stark
Nice vidéo, even if it's the same content for sdayae, sometimes if it's not too often it's nice
awe, pfft davie your just amazing . ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO SEE THIS IN HD? I DONT THINK SO........   man you cracking me up over here hahaha! to be real even movie stars dont look to hot w craxy high quality cams , no shame. just real
You should keep this beard
I like the beard.
I love the real-personality-Davie 😍 it's good to see you as a normal guy and not the YouTube persona sometimes! You may need a break if you feel too stressed. Take care of yourself Davie. We don't care about your numbers, so you may also need to chill out a bit, or else you may find yourself not so excited when you actually hit 10M subs. Just a random subscriber showing care for you. ❤️ We love you
I wouldn't stress too much about the numbers, I think your content keeps getting better and better!
F
The group looking for music and the group looking for Hype and memes doesnt overlap that much, I think. For example I subscribed a few years ago when you were mainly doing covers and am not that interested in 10 Minute Videos but rather chose my vids a little bit carefully
Hey Man, Really respect this video. I can't imagine how hard it is to exist in the realm of always trying to creating videos that make people want to watch. Just want to say that I always get a lot of enjoyment out of your videos and hope that you don't get too chewed up by the capatist side of things. Much respect. Slap
You look like Marion Cobretti
i lov u <3
You remind me of David Blaine😂
I can't see you feeling unhealthy.
U know, I'm not a fan of facial hair, but I kinda dig it on Davie.
Chess game reveal ?
”Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Dead.” So relatable 😂
beard= very emotional times.
Davie when you feel insecure and unhealthy, worship Jesus Christ playing hyme with bass, your feel god comforting you. Don Moen is a good worshiper , his worship will be so comforting and touching, please do watch his worship .
Why am I typing F in the comments? Anyway, I think these type of videos are great for those of us who actually watch. I watch personalities, not necessarily content, so I like basically everything you're doing. Just keep being who you are! Just so you know, Pew uploaded 2 hours before you, and only has twice your view count and he's at 110 mil subs. I think that's pretty awesome statistically.
Thanks, your beard helped me discover the true meaning of life...
We love you Davie. We know YT is a mess now, and how hard it must be for creators like you. But remember that you're an amazing musician, loved by millions of people across the world. Hang on tight bro and stay funky 👊
Haha 🤣
Davie I pray for your health. Jesus Christ is faithful and honest to listen our prayers and answer.
Hi Davie504. No slap bass? I am disappointed. Minus 10 subs.
Can you reveal your Pokémon Go friend code. I would love to SLAP!! your Pokémon! ;-)
do you know what BASS spelled backwards is ?... it still spells BASS.
Very nice xx
Hello.  Belated question…what three bands would you like to ‘sit in’ with, past or present? Thanks. Rest up.  Eat well.  Peace
We share the same birthday Davie. Also, I've lifted weights pretty much my whole adult life.  Lift with good form, & a decent intensity. Stick to the meat & potatoes compound lifts for a good couple of years. Don't worry about isolation stuff so much for now. Deadlifts are the daddy Davie...gotta be the best all round strength & size building exercise...but again, always good form.
The beard suits you!
Somebody get this man to 10 million subs! ASAP! 🍕🍕🍕🍷🍷🍷
One day, davie will post his last video and probably say "goodbye k-bros"
F for the beard. You should keep it, it looks good.
Lose the beard, keep the Kilimanjaro T-shirt.
You are a badass Davide 🤟🔥🔥

You mentioned that you wanted to get fitness into your life! I agree with you, and you should start now while you're thinking about it  I lift weights in my home using FREE WEIGHTS, and furniture, to work out for 30 min. 3 days a week. And ride a bicycle for Cardio fitness.  You will feel like a NEW person once you get started my friend.  Go jogging today!!!!!  I'm watching you on YouTube....
Entertaining and funny
What is that bass in the background with 6 tuning pegs?
F
Who inspired you to play BASS? David504: David Biale

i love you
Congrats 10 million subs, i'm from the future.
Hey you saw that that's @sora the troll !! GG . But then why he play guitar?
You look good With the Beard
I love when we get a little taste of your real personality dude. I bought my first bass like a year and a half ago because of you. I didn't really know what a bass was exactly before I stumbled upon your channel. Now I play bass every day, and feeling that I get better and better is an amazing feeling, and I have to thank you for making me excited for something, that I would discover I really love. I hope we can see Davide Biale a bit more often
Freddy Mercury reincarnated.

I knew you just one week ago and i love your videos, i slap the like button in every one of them with my 2 accounts. You are EPICO!!
Stay healthy. Hope you're doing well. <3 Not a famous person, but hopefully you feel lots of love from non-famous people like me that really enjoy your content and wish you the best in your career and life.

I actually really enjoyed the video. Keep being yourself bud. Most importantly stay funky bro Davie.
This was enjoyable.  Stay funky Davie
F
bye beard F
Davie, I've been watching for years, and I can tell that you are getting sick of having to make videos where you act because of that damn algorithm. I don't know you personally so Idk what works for you but a rest will never hurt. Take care.
Have you ever hit your camera at the end of a video??
F
F
Beard reveal
don't shave it, you look more manly with the beard. I bet it would even improve your slapping technique.
Please keep the beard, it's a really dope look 💥💪🏽

Davie504 in PogChamps - EPIC!
the beard is killer. love it
Hey Davie, if you like chess that much you could join Chessbrah or IM Rosen stream and give those guys a shout-out. They create awesome chess content, and I would love to see a small collab with them even for one short video.
Beard reveal , Epico , spero tu ti  riprenda presto 💪
When you go to slap the like button but you realize you already slapped like.
F
You look handsome with a beard. Grow it out a bit.
Do you make bass cool or does bass make you cool?
Beard looks nice.👍🏿

Like the beard bro
The fact that you made it this far on bass is insane. dont be hard on yourself bro
Like a friend I lost I missed you.   Wish I could of called while you were away!
Fare soldi e avere successo è una merda se non si è ludopati
I don't know how and why I discover Davie504's channel few years ago (ooooh I know I was looking for some guitar videos, 🤫shuuuuuuuutttt don't tell him 😂) but I'm really happy it happens. Take care of yourself man!

I like the beard!!
You seem kinda sad in this video 🙁. If you need a break from YouTube, take it and get your mind in the right place. I imagine that must be very hard to have to do things when we are not inspired or just not feeling like it. We'll be waiting for your 🅱️ass videos when you get back ☺️
BTW I don't know if it's just me, but with this video you hit me right in the feels. To the point that at the end of the video I slapped in sync with you just like I was giving you a high five. <3 I've never seen your final slap this way before.
F for the beard Stay funky big bro ❤️
Davie : My favorite country I've ever visited is YOUR country Me in North Korea : .o.
4:20 what the hell are your doing here Sora !
Thank you, man.
Lucky we had that laugh reveal a couple of years ago, it let you sneak in those little 'davie chuckles'.
F
Ooh. I have that shirt.
Keep it up Davie, love you
How long is your middle finger?
Hi Davie, hope your health get better soon.  And I slap this beard!  Stay funky !
Unshaven is so jarring, but somehow fitting for the mood of the video. Take things easy~
How you look with a beard? I would  just say, it is so OMG. And how you would look playing bass and wearing a beard...  so OMG 😊 💯 💯
Play stuff backwards
We live in a society...pff!
I love content.
You're the absolute best, Davie. You inspired me to play bass - and to slap it.
good luck with the 10M subs!
When do we expect to have some Pokemon Go content?
F
Maybe starting some Taiwan jokes and get burnt in random ways ? BTW 看這影片我一直不自覺拔鬍子==

Let the beard grow !
LUV THE BEARD!! also thank you and i hope u r doing well your videos make my day and i hope i get a bass for christmas so i can play like u do :)))
Honestly, I really loved this video (and your beard by the way) because we see the true Davide, you finally express your feelings without being Davie 504 and that's really a good thing...  PS: I know it's too late but you should have kept your lovely beard
3:50 Sneer reveal and beard reveal in the same video
He looks a lil bit like freddie mercury when he grew a beard
Epic beard game
If I ever meet Davie, I'll tell him he's tall then wait for the "Slap" to come :-D
🤜🏼💥🤛🏻
Thank you a lot, Davie  For all
Before:SLAP!  After:Hi
I dont get notifications of your vids :(
3:45 If you sort by Most Popular all of Davie's highest viewed videos are pure bass content
Never expected sora to make an appearance
I dig that Stubble, Make it a Beard ma guy
Question: Can you slap me pls -daddy- Davie? UwU
OMG I WAS WAITHING FOR THIS
Yay I’m one of the two people he inspired :D
David, you need to stop putting so much pressure on yourself my friend. 10 million subs will come in good time, you need to take your focus away from the numbers as it is clearly not helping you nor making you happy. Just remember that you are already a massively successful YouTuber. Nothing last forever so just enjoy the ride and stop tormenting yourself over the things you can't really control.  Be well Davie504.
Olryt!
Just become a model already!!!
Da fuk, davie with beard? You look great with it
I think the beard looks good! 🙂
lets all send Davie $1000 USd Dollars and demand our bass
Don't sweat it Davie, you are still a bass God. Really enjoy these Q&As outside of the persona you created

Play BASSless Whisper pls

Davie should grow it further into a goatee. Cause only GOATs like davie can pull it off.
When you play chess, do you play the Sicilian Defense or the Italian Game?
✨good beard✨
F
porque me recomienda esto si no hablo ingles
video quality is fine
F
Bass
I slapped the like immediately. Apparently you are not an Italian viking kind of guy, but I think some mustache or beard would suit you very well.
I was bass player turned acoustic player.   why?  because now it's my turn to sing.  as u know, it is extremely difficult to sing and play bass at the same time.   I know it can be done, but so hard.
I was scared you were going to tell us you had cancer and grew a beard for us before your hair started falling out from chemo. Glad to see ya again, YouTube is weird, this is the first time one of your videos has been recommended to me in months...
We love you davie!🧡
YOU'RE 6'7?!?
You ok my dude?

Question for the next QnA: Bass?
You kinda look like 1989  Freddie Mercury
Keep the beard. Looks so much better.
2 videos per week is because youtube only paid them 2 videos in a week that have the most view..thats why he dont want to put constant multiple videos upload every week
Much luv super mario bassist!
He did not say omg at end
Shave = smol pp
I play guitar and I've been wanting to play bass but sadly I don't have one
Love the keep it real videos. It's just nice to see you as a real person and less as a persona. Good luck Davie! Almost at the 10 mil!
f
F
thank you for that breach in your authenticity, it was super heartwarming. peace and benevolence to you 🙏 thanks for all the laughs and inspiration

You need Bass soup!
You should start live streaming, interacting with audience and do video reactions live, twitch or something that'd be cool

Don't even worry about the 10m subs, man. You will get them. You can't always have the best year ever and last year was an amazing year for you! You're channel is is great as ever and 10m just around the corner. Cheer, bro.
He got the shot. Sad, many such cases.
SHOW ALL YOUR BASS'S
never shave that beard
That chess joke was legendary, haha!
You don't look older than your age without a beard. You look like a baby to me. But I'm also almost 40, so that's probably why
Staying funky bro since 2015 😩🤟
Petition to make Davie to grow out his beard
I’m an on n off bass player. I just don’t have the time with work n kids anymore. You’ve inspired me at least 100+ times to pick my poor neglected bass back up after watching your videos. Your love of bass is motivating. I’ll keep watching when I can as long as you keep making videos.  Thanks Davie  From your favourite country.  My one
Take a vacation so you will be refreshed. You look tired. I am not a subcriber/non-watcher. I watch.
Love you
Dang! 6’7 inches. 🔥🔥🔥
😢 rip beard
Your videos haven't been recommended in months. Clicking the bell so I don't lose you again!
OK, question: a lot of YouTubers do live streams, and it seems they get a lot of tips that way. Sometimes they start a new channel for those, but not typically. What's your general feeling about live streams?
When you had to slap the like button three times for it to actually work
Comment for YouTube
BRUHBRUHBRUH yes lift weights and eat gud. I am lifting while watching you. I teach elementary band. You can get swole, too.

Yoooo davie very nice video, don’t be too focus on stats, of course it’s important because its your jobs and stats are the only way to see if your people enjoy your content, but you you will always have a community that follow you, do what you enjoy the most and its normal if some type of content don’t really work as well as others YouTube and the algorithm is a big mystery, love your video davie😄❤️
He needs to reach 10 million subscribers so he can make a bass out of his diamond play button
bASS CHAD
Keep it
Davie, I always watch your video when you release it. Even if I have a bad day, it will immediately improve thanks to that video
Man I wish I have a beard
Keep the beard, yo.
why are you so sad tho?
man, i slapped the like button before you even said anything.
Davie with that beard looks like an absolute Indian lmfaoooo
i would watch your vids if you would only play bass
stay health guys 👍🏻
You forgot to slap me at the begining This is a bad sign!
first of all, hiii i kinda missed you, i really enjoyed this real personality reveal 3 and i'm probably gonna watch it again second of all, thanks for distracting me from my sad reality in such a nice way <3 third of all: *beard*, i'm usually not a fan of beards, yours i think it's pretty cool but honestly you look great without it, just as you said - you dont need it  you won't read it but have a nice day anyway :D
Next : SDAIAY with beard 🧔🏻
I fucking love this man
Thanks for sharing, Davie! Question: what is significant about “504”? I watch all your videos. I don’t play bass, but would if I had the dexterity! I will find you on TikTok and subscribe.
"Can't wait for Chess 2" 🤣🤣🤣
You can't spell BASS without B[E]A[RD].
When eh say that my country si best I have thought that I ma italian so già best country si Italy ahahahah
What a Fantastic Beard Davie !!!

As much and I like Davie504, I think I like Davide more. Thanks for just being yourself sometimes.
We Mediterraneans look good with beard. You could very safely keep it.
I love the beard
Keep your beard and nurture it as a fellow Italian. It only increases the handsomeness

F For the beard
Vabbè dai tik tok è rottissimo, la gente guarda molto più content lì, su yt invece la gente guarda meno content ma più lungo, per questo ti ha fatto meno views. Poi gli shorts non li usa letteralmente nessuno.
If you're really 6'7, are you any good at basketball?
6:58 "just for you" and that *little smile* aaaah Davie referencing his wife's song so cute say hi to Joel from me lmao
Didn’t know Davie’s birthday before, clearly he is the reincarnation of Kurt Cobain from my favourite band ever, Bush. Love you Davie, make another massive band like bush pls
The beard looks sick dude. Keep it, or a mustache.
Saúde 💞🇧🇷
SLAPPED S2

There’s a word for people without beards - women.

your beard needs more BASS, should ask David Biale how he does it. I heard he can grow a beard in the shape of a BASS. confirmed BASS beard reveal at 10M subs ........
4:21 Sora The Troll!!!
I would slap the beard to feel how thick it is
You should keep the beard.
Your sarcastic and flat humor is hilarious
Keep doing your thing man. I'm an occasional viewer, subbed since "very impressive but..", but tune in from time to time because it's refreshing to see the energy and creativity you manage to maintain. You're a very creative musician & individual. I hope the channel keeps growing because it's amazing that a channel focused around the bass guitar has gotten so far, and further than anyone would have expected.   Be proud that your creativity filled the void of the hearts of every MysteryGuitarMan fan.
*helth*
You should do master of puppets but BASS
I think the reason your videos aint doing so well as last year, because it aint original anymore
F
That beard do be bussin tho

Looker in a beard davie.....keep it

You have inspired me to take up Bass. I've played a couple instruments starting with violin when I was in grade school, and took up harmonica while on deployment in the Navy. Been retired from the Submarine force for 10 years now and at 50 am taking up BASS, OMG..... Slapped like and subscribe after 2 or 3 videos and have binged watched a lot of your content. Keep up the good work and I keep slapping that like button!
4:35 Had to reverse it just to be sure. "Next question" :D
Buy a Sony A7S3.
From gender reveal to beard reveal
Davie lookin 🥵🥵
maybe talking videos have more views because people that watch you like you more as a person than a bass player
I hope you don't shave it! You honestly look awesome with a beard!
You are the best Davie❤
Davie you should SLAP for Twelve Foot Ninja! I believe they still need a bass player!
F
nice, beard reveal
Shroud ??
F for beard.
New subscriber here.  I was trying to get my two young children to stop watching TV and go play, so I started a playlist of your videos, thinking they wouldn't be interested.  They were mesmerized...now my 5 year old thinks bass is really cool.  Later my husband came in and said "oh you watch Davie504 too?". None of us know much about bass, but you are so entertaining for the whole family.  And inspiring!  Keep up the good work, your passion shows.  Subs don't count the little kiddos you are introducing to the instrument.  Much love
You look like spains 23yo football player Mikel Oyarzabal
The first man to grow a beard an actually look younger. Lol

David should keep the beard!!!!  We like Davie504 with beard!  At least slap Bass with bearded ness!
Parents revel????
Keep the beard... Thats a chad look if anything.
To be honest, I always thought he was quite young when he had no beard
You should live stream on twitch, bro. Play bass, chat a little, react to bass videos etc. That would be epic!!!!
Stay safe and healthy! And keep that beard!

The Davie504 with beard looks so normal and human
Davie, the fiverr videos have always been my favourite, where you pay people for requests or try and recruit other bassists (including triple camera guy). Are we going to see any more of those?
Stay healthy bros
I really like this moment where Davie is being true to all of us and yet still being hilarious.
*presses F in the chat*
You to be the king of the bass :O
What a straight forward video HAHAHAHAHA tbh i was also thinking abt how devie doesn't get bored on SDAIAY literally most of the post is abt pizza and a guy looked like him 😂😂.. now i know deep down he's bored too
F
Take your time. And consider keeping the beard.
BASS
Fine! Take my sub. Long time watcher finally decided to sub. Thanks for making me understand how important subbing is to you (and I'm sure other channels as well). I never went anywhere with my attempts at internet fame so I never really saw it from the same standpoint as the more successful channels. Let's hope you get to 10 million soon so you can hopefully get some of that stress off of them tall ass shoulders.
You look like a pasta thief  Who moonlights as Bass Slapper
with a beard like that you just look like gennaro gattuso.....😁😁😁
Mr.504 I actually think the "beard" looks well on ya.. Truly.. Not sure how old/young U are but I'd guess between 24 & 27 😎 -now that I'm almost done watching this vid I seen 1994 as you DOB so I was right on the money! Whatever that means 😁
Im in a bank queue watching your clickbailt video. Add me to pokemon go plus davie 9329 8928 1419 I will send you gifts from my small town here in Chile. Love you

10,000,000 subscribers= 10,000,000 seconds of beard growth
I’m so glad you think my country is the greatest, thank you.
Тебе идёт борода
Keep the beard
You should let the beard grow out until you look like a hillbilly, wear suspenders with no shirt, and try to slap a banjo.

You look better with the facial hair, man.
Davie, your beard is so cool!
Thank you for inspiring me to try to learn how to play bass. It was not only you, but the biggest influence on me is yours. Grazie mille!
GigaChad504
F
Tbh I think being in a band is much easier (for your mental health at least). creating a new song with your band sounds easier than coming up with new video ideas for years and years.
Make it at least 3 people you've inspired to play bass!! I was actually going to keep learning guitar, but you've convinced me to switch to the better instrument. Ps the beard looks good. You look younger with it. Not that you look any more than 50 without it.
It looks deepfaked
F
f
oh shit I missed the QnA question   Davie got a question for you  Want a cool bass guitar ?  I promise you it will be 100% D.i.Y and 100% one that you didn't seen before or played before. You will love it ;)
The beard may get you more slaps
I love the beard! It looks great. You should do a video with it half shaved to see if it looks half as good.   If you are looking for a good anime I highly recommend Death Note.
I don't think you should stress and worry so much about views and subs, just focus on what you can control: Slapping B A S S
Ffffffffff
F
I just automatically like on Davie's videos now, it's more of a habit nowadays. Cheers Davie.
Idk if I like you davie504. You've made me spend all my money on bass
Davie, do a video playing pedals
Bro, keep the beard. It’s awesome.
F
As  a Libyan...I don't know how to take "I liked your country"...He's obviously talking to me and was specific that he liked my country, but given the history....GASP! I think Davie504 is secretly trying to invade us again!  Checkmate, Davie! We're ready for you guys this time and your bass slapping fare!

Imagine running into Davie out in the world and he slaps you and runs away😂😂
Davie504 heart my comment or I will slap your bass
It looks like you have beard.
Of course you didn't expect me to be so tall, because I'm always sitting. 🤣
Don't worry Davie, you'll reach 10M this year, and I'll reach 50k in 2027. Everything's fine.
Great beard
=))))))
He looks like zeke if zeke isn’t a titan shifter but a regular guy
Fan : will you send me free bass?  Davie : Yes, send 1000USD i will send you bass free....e That got me😂😂😂
You really should use beard. You look more serious, and the jokes are even funnier.
You are pregnant??? You will have a minibass!!??
Hope you're looking after yourself dude.  You make me laugh - that's pretty rare.

I may not be able to Slapp Like on your videos but I do save time to catch up on videos that I missed since I subbed on your channel around 2018-19. Been an avid fan ever since. Stay funky 🤘
Nice Beard 👌
Do I get this right: do you play Chess? I'll checkmate you.

Staying funky no matter what
Always funky
The lovely Beard is gone but not forgotten 😢❤.

i bought a bASS because of you!! i love your content so much. Keep inspiring people with what you do <3
If Davie504 likes this, I will do a comment reveal.
woow you look handsome with your beared man!
I would like now a don’t laugh challenge again with bass laughing therapy at the end 😁
This man is going to have 10 millions subs - which means he is famous as fck. Around the whole world. But in the first place, as we can see in this video, he is still only human being. A man, who sometimes feel stresfull, burned, sad, angry... My first thought is to give him a hug, open a bottle of beer and relax for a while on a bench. Davie504, you feel this way, because you've been happy. You achieved something amazing, inspired many people. So dont worry... this sadness its just short period, which came back many times. Remember, that you feel this beautiful sad, because you were and you will be happy again.

Hey Davie it’s going to been 100 degrees Fahrenheit in my town this week. How tall are your parents.
Jacksepticeye
Contexto plsss xd (no entiendo el inglés )
no bass this time? disappointed.....
YouTube es duro de conquistar 😁
stay funky too and watch one of my videos. they distract.
Keep the whiskers.
This "obviously" at 3:51 broke my heart. It must really hurt him that his bass only videos don't get as much views as his other videos. :(
I love your content Davie, don't worry about the 10M, they will come
ngl, beard504 looks nice
Question: what happened to your girlfriend? Is she still alive?
Ánimo, Davide!
Man, i really felt kinda down this few days. Now i feel way better. Never stop doing what you're doing Davie. I love your videos
I'm only at the start of the video and i can already see in future david will attempt to shave his beard but suddenly he will say "oh no, i can't shave it. something is stopping me to do it😨"  then here we go again, "real face reveal in 10m sub... send help"😂
F
Ill give an idea. More like a challenge. You should djent using bass. Do it now or small pp
7:55 Me watching every single video that comes out: <feels good>
F
F
I can tell hes tired by the looks of his eyes. Get sone rest bud
Petition to make Davie keep his beard🙏
That beard is weak!  Chuck Norris is laughing.  You should grow it long enough to SLAP the bass with it. Like 69 inches. Epical!  Stay healthy bro. Numbers ain’t nothin’ but a thang.
3:13 so im one of the 2 who's the other one?
F
Davie 50beard
What is “Slap Bass”?
I love it!!!!
3:13 i swear i seen these eyes in movies i swears it-

Look after yourself Davie504, I watch every one of your vids that comes up in my notifications and I always slap the like button.
F beard
You are born the same day that Kurt Cobain died :O
If it may make you feel better man.. i watch your videos whenever i get a chance and always leave a like because now i know..a lot of people do not act as they should i mean i subbed to your channe..l the least i can do is give a like for your efforts putting on this video..anyways never change bro and keep your head held high because i find you more real and down to earth than anyone on YouTube..so keep it up and best success to your future project. Respects from canada. Oh and i am also a bit Italian..isnt that cool?? Haha
f
Beard Davie is Badass
I think I know why your subscribers don't often see your videos in their feed - If you don't click the notification bell, it sorts recommended videos based on recent watch history.  If a given subscriber starts watching other types of videos a lot, it will get deprioritized severely.  There are channels I used to watch all the time that don't get placed very high on my feed anymore, because I watch mostly unrelated videos more frequently.  There have been channels, where I'll say to myself "I haven't seen a video from so and so for a while, I wonder if something happened?" and I'll go look  and find that they've been posting videos regularly, but YouTube just doesn't show them to me, because I've been watching different videos lately.  Subscriptions mean nothing compared to current viewing trends
If I’m gonna be real, if Davie lets that beard grow in and gives it some tlc, it’d be a dope look.
Davie :its your contry The guy who lives in north korea: :)
cool beard
Bye beard.
You're a handsome devil what that beard sir 🤴🤘🏼 great video! Wait as long as you need to post the next one haha! Love you bros!
f

Ah, it's about health, not HEALTH
It looks super great!

Davie looks kinda wiser tho
Hi, Davie504. I'm subscribed to your channel on youtube. I always get your vids on my notifications. But I am currently disabled. I lack of a good internet access.  I couldn't help but missed several videos. *sob* . Does it help if I see them once after a while you upload them?  Not F for your beard, though.  It is not important the beard outside, but the inner beard what it counts.
3518 0901 8654 add me Davie I won't even know if really you as this has 3.7k+ comments
Loving your work man! Keep it up, in your own pace! 💞
he's getting ready for a manscaped sponser
You look like a criminal with that beard :D
I wounder if Davie shave his beard by slaping it off
This was really really nice, I really enjoyed watching this
Awesome Beard, Davie!
U look Great ❤👍👍
This was a good video, it might be the emotional music in the background, but it felt much more personal.  Also the old "Stay funky bros" gets me everytime
Will you do a 69 strings bass video soon
3:45 this question make Dave chuckle, my day better now
f
With his beard he looks actually Italian
Love  from india bro ♥❤

Stay healthy bro. I wish you would do therapy time again, always helped.
Wait.. 6' 7 inches??? Wow.
Most important words in the whole world: -Checkmate -Oh em gee -Slap -Slappers...  oh em gee i forgot the most important one: -B̶a̶s̶e̶ Bass
really liked this type of video
Davie504: "I didn't write a script" Us: "never asked about it"  But also Davie504: -Intentionally revealing- _that he's doing a skit/script every video_
Somehow he looks more normal with a beard
bearded davie looks cool! 👍👍
f
You should try watching Angel Beats. It's a 2010 anime, and has a very good sound track. One of my favorites. I found your videos just recently, and you inspired me to buy a Bass. Thank you.
Davie slap heart on this comment
Beard :0
With beard the looks like chandler brother lol

Keep the beard. It adds to the BASS face.
3:20 kkkk stupid question and good answer
4K please
okay i've seen bearded davie i can die in peace now
2 weeks? I Hope you didn’t get Covid504. Thanks for all you do. I enjoy the video504s a lot.
Since when did Davie start looking so fucking cool?
I'd adore to see you play the Pacific Rim theme, if you haven't already. Also, Are you the tallest person in your family?
F for da beard ✋😔 It was good while it lasted
VERY IMPRESSIVE but can you do a Q&A in both a beard AND an eyepatch? Slap like if you are excited
Stay healthy bro
It looks... strange and unusual
it ok davie take your time💛

I watch every new video you upload.
People are using less time on YouTube, because pandemic is getting better. So don't stress to much.

F
Stay Funky man!

Nice Beard!
Love you and your channel. Stay healthy! Feeling with you! With this beard you need a cigarette to complete this look.
F
So, I guess, the audience across platforms may be overlapping, and posting a successful video on TikTok (just for instance) can bring some new subs on YouTube as well. And from the other hand, even if most of the audience will not reach here, building your success elsewhere doesn't sound like a bad thing, hm? What do you think? Maybe it's time to invade other resources and become even more powerful? :) Why keep trying to beat local algorithms if there are media more loyal to music that YouTube )))
F
Stay funky, Davie...
F
Greatings from Poland ❤
Nice
Is it just me or he just gigle or laugh a little
I'd love to see a bass collection reveal
“Can’t wait for chess 2” 😂
Stay funky)

I heard Davie slaps fans so hard their face flys off
I love all off your videos (that I've seen).

You should send me your trainer code.
F
Davie, I wanted to say that you are pretty handsome without shaving. But you always are. Thanks for the video.
My mother has a beard like Davie's, so I was wondering if someone could slap her for me.
F
I like beard😊 plus I slapped like. Yay😁
You look good with a beard, Davie. Take Care
The way that "next question " got faster and faster untill it disappeared
I know I haven't watched Davie504 in a while, but dang he has a beard now
What if we can photoshop and remove Davie's beard

Whatever you do Davie, don't challenge Logan Paul to bassboxing match.
Okay, how many of us are professional bassists, , lifelong, and to have " bass" player humor, the inside jokes applicable to us, amazing. And how many of Davies subscribers do what I do, every single time...which is at the end of the video, when he raised his hand, looks at it, says " stay funky" and then slaps, how many, out of respect and appreciation, raise there hand ( no matter where they are on this planet) and slap Davie " high five"??? I always do ( and feel good,like I had actual contact), just wondered if EVERYONE did that.
F
question for your next QA: did your girlfriend introduce you into anime?
Don’t even think to shave it!
Keep up the great work, I check out the old and new content because its motivational as a bassist and funny to watch at the same time!  Looking forward to the 10 mil play button bass reveal.

You look sick man
Bearded Davie is giga chad energy
Looking good on beard
Cook spaguetti!
Don't be afraid to be wild Davie. I personally would love to see you trying to learn some non string instrument. As cool as bass is, what if you tried to learn the sax and brought us along for the journey?
helt
So you play Pokemon Go!? Go out, catch a FeeBASS & Evolve Shieldon into a BASStiodon ;)
such an emotional video. take care davie ♥ thank you for being you!
I kinda like your beard
question for the next q and a,: what kind of cereal can make bass?

I love all your videos Davey
Thank you for the beard reveal
Health full of health
We got your back

How do I send the $1000 for the free bass?
An early Beard Reveal?  Pretty Nice if u ask me
Dude, you look very good with the beard, you should leave it on.
Brother, just keep your head up and continue to be great, the results will come for sure! You inspired me a lot and I bought my first bass this year because of you! Big hug from Portugal
the meters with a meter?
"You have to put on your own mask before helping others."  This isn't the perfect fit for that well-known psychological health tip, but it's good enough.  Regardless of your intentions--to grow your YT channel, to reach and inspire people about bass, to be doing something you love for a living and have it show through--you've got to take care of yourself first, or everything else falls apart.  Good advice for every single person.  You'll get to 10M in a few months at most.  I'd say get it, get your diamond play button, make a thankful video (which I know is completely sincere), get the diamond play bass construction process going going, and then take a sabbatical.  Not a vacation; a sabbatical.  Sabbatical comes from "sabbath" which literally means "a time of rest."  Vacations are not restful.  Three months is a typical length for a sabbatical for people in stressful jobs.  Do whatever's necessary to rest, enjoy your time, think about things, NOT think about things, and just heal.  We'll be around.  It's stressful and lonely at the top.  We understand.  We'll still be here.
I think that beard looks so awsome, i just wanna slap it!

I found the anime question funny. Seeing as how Davie has mentioned in previous videos that he actually didn’t watch anime 😂. Great response from Davie though. I do love the bass playing videos, ill watch them from start to finish too. Just like all of Davies videos. But these videos where you genuinely speak from the heart also hit very good on a personal level. Keep up the great work. Stanky funky bro!
Keep the beard bro.
You should keep it
Who is this old man in a Davie504 video?
but-
Outside of science documentaries, Davie is literally the *only* youtuber where I get excited to watch his new videos.
bella barba...
Davie, the beard is men's version of the Wonder Bra. Keep it up.
Davie504, have any of your basses ever retaliated and slapped your bASS? This is no laughing matter and a very serious question.
😦
*frantically adds beard to swag shopping list
Beard!
Look like what I think about it... is that first Davie man you're the youtuber I watch the most, Like I already wake up listening to your tracks and more since the end of 2019 I got to know your channel I kind of loved everything you do do, man you showed the world that the bass is a great instrument that can't be underestimated, like it surprises me because a well played bass has the best sound and you're really good at it you have a lot of musical talent, make the bass do it sounds I've never heard sincerely thank you davie, now i want to be a bass player like you, i'll try my best for it... thank you once again Davie and may god bless your life and work :3
the real reason why subscribed people don't look at your videos is that there are too many subscriptions too go through  each month there would be atleast 1 person with 1 increased subscription to other youtuber, because they are interested in other stuff as of now  Hope you hit 10M soon
Justin Beiber is kinda SUS
Bye beard
f
F
Lookin great davie
i wouldnt be dissapointed in 400,000+ views. id like to get half of that on anything. or even a fraction of that.
I really think that davie needs to take some time, it would be good if he relaxed for a while, fearing 9 million people commenting on his videos is not easy, so, I'm sure it would help to find what to do, I hope you read this comment, I'm sure that your mental health matters a lot more for now, we all love you davie, OH btw send bass
F
WTF am i doing? Its 1AM and watching this video.. seems like i just lost my sense of humor ....
Keep the beard.
Finally a manly look. Need more beard and stash to be a real bassplayer! And long hair too. Need more hair!
Actually, i cmnted once in an old video of his saying what wud davie look like with a beard but he didnt rply bcz i wasnt a subscriber but was a frequent viewer. So thanks davie for finally revealing ur beard. Also davie with 69420 iq: 2:14 USD "dollars" 😐
Emotional time!
No OMG at the end :(((
Love your humor...makes me want to stop picking and start slapping! Oh, and my question, have you always slapped bass?
Hey Davie, we love you
Davie on more anime song please (Dragon ball super opening theme)🙏
So i'm actually one of your subscribers that watches less of your videos. I have to say last year the Covid lockdown produced more Youtube watchtime and I wouldn't miss a video. Now i watch less of your videos because I watch less Youtube. I wish I had more time. Stay funky Davie504! Great work as always!
You look... AMAZING
Beard looks weird
It's weird considering how few Patreons Davie504 has, especially compared to his Youtube subscriber count. If you love Davide and his music, commit to the minimum tier on his Patreon. And buy his albums, damn!
For those that say Davie504 is not always sitting down at 1:52 will receive a SLAP! Because in his video "I Laugh For The First Time EVER" he was sitting in a walking chair :) ALL hail Bass! "press F in (at end of video) Chat" I pressed it five times in chat! wahoo cause its Davie  "F" 5...
te amamos davieeee
i not always play the bass anymore, but i watch all your videos davie you are a legend

I S L A P P like on a video of Davie with beard. I'm proud.   F for Davie's beard
Con la barba sei un figaccione della Madonna
Davie, I have an idea for you that I hope you will like. Ask your fans to send you music clips that they have made that don't have bass. Then, you can make a video of you adding   basslines to them. It would get a lot of views, and let you play bass more.
Take care good Sir.

If you did hour long compilations of your old bass videos I’d watch those. I like listening while I do homework, but I don’t like all the youtube premium ads in between every video. Other people have compilations of your videos, but I wanna support you directly

To be honest davie, I think you should relax a bit. Based on what you said about your thoughts on YouTube I dont think thats healthy. Listen, your fans are here to support you and will help you at your time of need. The ones who really watch your videos are the ones you should cherish. Take care my man.
This hair is simple, just cool, and now let's talk about the hairstyle...

I picked up bass because I saw David Caraccio’s cover of RHCP when I was 18. He’s amazing but so are you and I sure hope plenty kids will pick up bass after watching your videos thanks to all the spotlight you’re giving to this awesome instrument. I suck at playing but have lots of fun! Continua così Davide che ci fai fare pure bella figura all’estero. Qui adoriamo tutti i tuoi video, e li guardiamo sempre con piacere! Un abbraccio.

Es la primera vez que te veo con barba y bigote xd te queda muy bien la verdad:)
It's nice to know that people working toward 10 million subs are also thinking "dammit why can't I get any traction?" Lol
Davie > Giga Chad
STAI BENISSIMO CON LA BARBA
Idea or question take it as it is, but ever thought about doing a bass on bass cover? or in other words ,   run a bass then cover that with another bass , your bass beats are phenomenal .  I think I need to give up guitar for few reasons and go with bass, maybe do  both!
Davie504 became even more chad with this beard

Bald davie with beard?

I'm seeing so much love in the comments for the first time in this channel ❤️❤️ He deserves 10m subs

Heyho Davie
Videos like these, Davie's responses feel very genuine, like he's opening up to his audience, and I think that's really wholesome. ❤️
f
My internet is shit where i'm at atm but somehow for this video my pc decided it would go hd 1080p when my internet can only hold 240p sometimes
There is a word to describle people without a beard....   ......Those are called "WOMANS"......
amazing video love your content keep up the good work
I think TikTok numbers are kind of bloated, just seems too unreal but idk man 🤷🏻
F
U R blessed with being skinny. Most people R fat. Like yours truly
Missed you. Love this video, your real self reveal and the beard, too.
Classical covid-19 beard incident :D did the same but at the point i realized there some grey hairs .... i just got rid of beard again :D
Good vibes, also Shout out to Alex Moukala music. Dude is underrated.

I wanna see Davie504 shaving his beard
lmao
Davie, beard is best, grow a beard, it's good advice, use it.
F
Definitely seems like I've just been getting recommended random video instead of my subscriptions lately... YouTube trying to make it more difficult to watch the videos I actually want to watch. Hang in there Davie!!!
You don't look bad with a beard.
6:25 philippines??? thankyouuuu!!!
F
Dude, you look good with that beard
Maybe YouTube is the ultimate videogame? You score with views, comments and subscriptions with achievements for landmark subscription numbers. You must determine how best to use the power of bass to entertain both viewers and satisfy the all powerful algorithm.
"cant wait for chess 2" 😂 i love this video, davie. Youre way too funny...these answers are another reason why im such a fan of yours. ❤️
I seen one video from you .. my uncle played bass before he died... the way you do your videos is what made me love the channel the way you are is exactly what I like.
You look like nas daily
Hii Davie, to be honest I think you look a little bit sad, I wish a could help you, but I don't know how. I think you should take some vacation, not because the video contents, but because your mind's health. Also, I'm working on a video for you, a drawing in my free time. The idea is it be a meme but I want that it looks cool at the same time. I don't know how many time I will need to do that, but I will post it on your redit page when it's done. Also, I'm a brazilian who makes english videos (sometimes Lmao) and I'm feeling the same difficulty to say some phrases too LOL. I wish you the best. Sooner you will get the 10M subs, I know it and you should know it too.
10 million sooonn.   Ayyy
F for the funky beard Davie
I will recommend your channel to all my friends and colleagues until you reach 10 mill subs🔥 Keep going Davie❤👍
I seriously don't wait for any YouTuber but damn i wait for ur videos 🥺♥️ .... After every 3 days u upload new video .. but this time it took longer i was worried
helf k

Looking at davie504 have a beard is hot as hitman.
The emotional music really got me. That being said, I’m glad you talk openly about some of your concerns with the channel. Really humble of you :)
We all love you Davie,take care.❤️🤗

Ohohoh... Would you prefer 10 subscribers and 8 views?  Wanna swap mate 🤣?... But seriously, good video, appropriate amount of jokes... It's not going to have a lot of views (appropriate amount of jokes 😅)
Hey Davie! I just got my first bass today!! I was so inspired by you playing bass I got one and I am so excited to play it :))! I’m a guitar player (not the best) so it’s time to become a bass player instead
Davie arabian style😉
Davie's next video will be the 666th vid in his channel lmao
Thanks bud, I always enjoy your videos
Wow, bEARd
Do you find offensive that there are Guitar Hero games but no Bass Hero games?  Those game's devs need to be slaped.
5:22 - 5:26  Same.
So calm
About your subscribers... a few days ago I watched a video of a bassist of Thomann playing four Nathan East basslines. Top comment was from Nathan East. I thought it couldn't be him, so I clicked his profile and yup, it was him. Checked out a little deeper and he has subscribed insane amount of channels. And one of them was Davie504.  So if you see this, you might want to check out every famous bassist on Youtube.  Who knows who else is subbing.
EPICO DAVIE504 love you bro ❤️❤️❤️
Davie is a nice and wholesome guy. I've heard people say that they don't like his videos because he's a jerk, but they really don't realize, that he is playing a character for the show. The best example is the singer from INXS. He was an extremely good showman, but in reality, he was shy and depresses
f for the beard, it suits you very well
beard is pretty fire tbh
F
What happened to the Davie504 signature bass?
Was watching on my xbox, had to open my phone to comment and say something because something you said irked me. It made me sad to hear you say, "If you were growing at the rate you were last year, you would already be at 10,000,000 subs."  Progress isn't linear. You will hit 10m when you are supposed to hit 10m, and not a moment sooner or later. You have an incredible channel, and we see all the effort you put into your work. I appreciate you and your videos. Theres no doubt that you will keep growing and being a badass, so enjoy what you have made here. Be proud of yourself, even if its not easy.   Youre doing great things
Te quiero mucho Davie
Davie never been so manly before.
Handsome :3
take care of yourself, dude
Davie should let his beard and hair grow at least 1 year so we can have a pirate Davie reveal
OOOOMMMMMGGGG you missed that, nvm we are with you always man! take care about your physical and obviously mental health , 10M is knocking at the door:)

I have just recently started watching your channel....I have watched many videos on you tube with Bass in the past - especially ones with the late, great Mick Karn, my Bass hero. Have you heard him ? You probably have...so why did it take you tube so long before it recommended your fantastic site ? Strange !! Anyway thanks for your videos and the entertainment they bring...keep slapping...
Just wanna say I don't usually comment on videos and I'm not a bass player (electric guitar, but not touched it in about 8 years) but I do enjoy your videos even if I don't see all of them. Stay safe and healthy!!
What about you and @RoomieOfficial ?!
Ily
How do you feel about short scale bass guitars? After 35 years, I’ve traded in my standard basses for short scale!
One of the problems with having less views, is that lots of people is subscribed to hundreds of channels and most of them are not interested in majority of videos from this channels or just don't have time to watch all, and cannot handle with all of then, that is why i only am subscribed to like 60 channels that i prefer to watch almost all videos from them.
thank you Davie! 我會繼續努力學slap!!
F
u look like indian
Slow and steady Davie! Love the content
i literally asked my self earlier why he isn't uploading anything for 2 weeks now.... this is the only youtube channel I actually wait for videos to be released.... thought something happened.... stay well davie!

Smart move making money on youtube instead of playing bass live.  I've been playing bass live for a long time.  Not a lot of money in it for most people.  Beard looks good.

For what it's worth, me and my 1 year old daughter love your videos. She's not allowed to watch screens, but she gets so excited to see your face, I make an exception. I look forward to them every week (been subbed since maybe like 3m?)
Davie plss grow up my beard too 😭
Davie 504, stay blessed and stress less bro 🖖💙

you're awesome man :)
Slap the Youtube algorithm in the bass by making some videos with prolific Pokemon GO youtuber Billy at the Trainer Club.
sora the troll xD collab when?
Beard looks great on you! It's a keeper! 😉
Pokemon Go is a pretty bad dopamine drip. Too many delays in gratification. Candy crush is much more generous, though ritalin requires less of a time commitment...
Keep up the awesome work Davie! I bought my first bass last week because if your videos. You rock and I enjoy your content a ton. Beard looks sweet too btw
nice!
Some one with your skills should play with other musicians. .it's not healthy staring at al those screens day in day out talking with others  On a keyboard ..millions watch your channel , admired for your awesome musical skills , Go out back to your roots ,familia, nature, having fun jamming etc ..

Love you Davie
What not even a single string slap🤌🏽

I really like the beard! I think it suits your facial features.
Davie I feel like a gaming channel would be really fresh. That genre on YouTube is so oversaturated but when it comes to you the way you talk and your style I feel like could be really good for a gaming channel. Do walkthroughs with no cuts so we can see you laugh. I feel like that would feel so fresh
F
I actually like the beard
PoGo team? level? and who is you buddy?  Can we be friends?
Beard looks great. Fitting for the Bass Boss.

You are putting a smile to my face almost every time with your videos. Sometimes it’s joy, sometimes it’s laughter. You are an incredible artist! Don’t ever let numbers bring you down. You are valuable and you matter!

Beard is nice. Big beard reveal when? Also bro, don't put on yourself the weight of amassing subs in the system. The pandemics is not over, but as it's getting better people as a whole will watch a little less YouTube, so a decrease is normal. Independently of it, you and BASS still slap my heart <3
Beard would look good if you let it continue to grow my man. Hope your well

Beard looks epic! Have you thought about doing a Fiverr video where you hire composers/producers/songwriters to make a full track around one of your basslines? I feel like it'd be awesome to see what kinds of styles of songs people build around it.
F to the beard. Loved this, it is such a pisstake that YouTube doesn’t recommend your main style of content to people and it really should be changed, but I still love to see them.
so beard
Keep the beard!

Davie, I am one of your 10 percenters. Keep doing what you do and I will keep watching whatever you put here.
Not trying to provoke anxiety here, hopefully won't, but here's a question: is there a point to having more and more subscribers? It seems that they really don't translate into views that much, especially with these changes of the YouTube algorithms. Isn't it better to have only subscribers, who watch most of your new content? I think I've watched over 200 hundred of your videos since subscribing a couple of years ago (OMG), rarely missing anything new, but not a lot of people do that -- doesn't it make the algorithms value you less in the end?

too long
me Simping over Davie with a beard *cough *cough
I feel every successful YouTuber goes through this stage where the numbers start really messing with your head. And in the end, they always end up saying that they became happiest when they learnt to stop stressing over the stats and just did what makes them happy. Not an easy task for sure. But I hope you can break through this fog that is weighing you down and learn to enjoy what first made you passionate about bass and YouTube again. Mental Heath is just as important, if not more important, than physical health. We’re here for you Davie! So I hope you feel better soon! Take care.
You look more handsome with beard, F
Dont worry davie we GOT YOU! You will reach 10m subs soon and we will all cheer for you!

that beard was surprising! I think you should make another video 100% in Italian, it'd be cool. And may bass keep you healthy and happy.

Yeah the algorithm is kinda cucking you over at the minute. This is the first of your video that's been recommended to me in 6 months
Davie with a beard is sick
Actually when the Europe Cup started - here in Germany they were talking about the "Finalists" prediction - saying Germany / France / UK / Portugal. I didn't have you in mind - but I told myself - and Italy? And carried on driving to work. Boom Italy won every Match Boom Italy won the Semi-Finals  And I joined in on the 11M shots vs Britain. I didn't want the Brits to win - alone for the fact that they were very rude against Denmark - I know don't put the Hooligans together with the rest of the country - but alone for them I didn't want them to win. Undeserved.  But chakalaka they won it - mad lads. I really should've betted something somewhere on them like I could've made thousands.
10m should be right toe reveal!

Unfortunately I can only subscribe once. And I did that a long time ago. I have not watched every video you've made, but I've watched a lot of them. They show up in my recommendeds all the time. What I wish you two would stop doing is recommending the same videos over and over. There are some videos that I do want to watch more than one time, but most of them I only watch once.  Keep on slappin Davie
Downfall started Davie, nothing last forever

I am not subbed, i play guitar (with a pick..) and i still watch your videos, making weird numbers on your channel stats... As i write, there's a quiet rumble downstairs.. the P-bass is calling but i will resist. If i become a slapper because of you, i will subscribe..  .. and it's fine to take a break, got to relax. you can talk to us, we are here to listen to you.. THERAPY TIME...  mhmm..  yes... i know it's crazy..    me too...   just burry the body in the garden...     yes, with his picks ..

F for beard.  While this video didn't have bass, it was really nice to see something some genuine.  Stay funky and healthy!
Love you man.  BTW, you can say at least three as I bought a bass and started slapping because of you.  Thank you for the inspiration.
THE BEARDDDDD AAAAAAAAA
I'm through a real shit with my mental health right now and I'm glad I whatched this video. Ususally Davie is so "in role", but this one was so calm and relatable. Despite it's a parasocial relationship, I've got really better for 9 minutes. Thank you, I've been on this channel from 10k and I watch all the videos! Also I've noticed, Davie looks a bit dissapointed. I think if you're throuth some adifficult times, you'd better not hung up with video making and stuff, take care of you health. Your fans will be with you, stay funky, bro!
Use Ur mouth to speak English properly ........!!!  😂😂😂😂

F
👍
You're going to get through this. And it's alright to take a break. We can wait. And we'll be right here when you're back
regarding being stressed about the 10M subs milestone: would you be happy/would the channel be sustainable with 5M subs? If so then having the arbitrary goal of a big number, and the search for growth, will never provide happiness. It will only push the goal forward, in an endless hedonistic quest that will also provide failures and stress.. I'm not a YTuber so I might be missing sumething, but I think that if you were to run your channel with no growth goal, just a a good channel with a solid number of subs, it would be easier on your mental health. :)  ottimo lavoro davide, continua così ciao
healt
Sora is in the video!
Davie! I must inform you that Chess 2 is already out, try searching it on steam, or watch reviews on YouTube!!!
Bhets ali ba ta
I've been subscribed for a while but I sorta stopped watching your videos not because of YouTube but how your content became primarily reaction based videos, I know you posted more than that but a high amount of them were reaction videos.
F
I hope your channel will boom again like last year. Stay strong and healthy. Love from Germany
Imagine getting a kidney from davie 🤣🤣
Excuse me but I would like you to let that beard stay there I actually think it looks pretty epico
Not shaved Davie looks great 👍

Too much truthiness in this video Davie.  Btw, 69420 is my favorite passage from the bible.
I think im gay
Grow it out!!!
On the day one legendary musician died, another was born.
I think he should do more fiverr videos or the other contest type videos, it was a good way to communicate with fans and really fun videos to watch;)
You know you don't have to do anything crazy in your videos for them to be EPICO, they just are

You know and I know, taking a break would probably destroy your momentum completely, thus will further distance you from the goal. But pushing forward with the dead zone weighing on your mind would cripple you in the long run. Whatever your strategy, keep on meditating, have fun, have enough rest, drink water! Stay funky Davie
This beard is epic, keep it

Davie looks better with beard tbh
Take care I enjoy your vids no matter what so dont worry about your upload schedule and I'm waiting for you to look like the terminator   Take care
Comment for making this video up
Nice
You sure it's not drugs? Seems like a phase for every youtuber
The beard looks great!  I wish that you had kept it.  In any case, I enjoyed this format of you talking about things.  Yes, there's occasional humor, which is fine, but it's mostly REAL.  That's what entertainment lacks so much of today, that and enough bass.
I'm kinda waiting for that "OMG!!!" Ending
This video will be cherished by many people for atleast 42.69 years

F for the beard
Man this thing felt very real and hit me you have problems too
💜❤💝🧡💛💚💕💖
Would you play the bass with beard?
More videos like this please :)
Why you do not stream on Twich? Bad inglish
i havent seen ur vids in a while and i never knew you grew a beard
Eating and sleeping are as important as lifting if you want to gain some muss-skulls
Question: Have you thought of making an interactive app/game for us to use for getting to know bass and how to play a bass guitar, or anything related to you/the channel?
Predatory algorithms are ruining peoples brains and peoples youtube channels

Stay funky Davie
Rambo with beard '-'
you look very communist with that beard
Wait?? I thought davie edited the thumnail
I think I have a nice idea for a video. Why don't you do a collab with Adam Neely? I am sure it will be very intresting to watch. I can admit that Adam's vast knowledge about music theory can make most musicians look uneducated in an interview about music but I think that Adam is a man that may make you want to go further and study more about music, in general. Don't get me wrong, your music is great but just knowing how to play an instrument is different from knowing how to make music. Get better soon, man.
L beard 🧔
KEEP THE FACIAL HAIR
Loved it davie ❤️❤️
Even for unscripted, you show such a great, dry sense of humor. I don’t play bass, I just sing. But you’ve had me thinking about learning. I really enjoy listening to the great bass on here, but I come back for you sense of humor. Just how I’m wired. Thanks for another fun video! ✋🏼
You good?
"F" is for "Beard"
Yeah, I'm subscribed. I'm subscribed to many channels so I don't have notifications turned on. But I don't notice a lot of content creator's new videos.  I even go through the subscribe tab daily and it just doesn't sort correctly. I agree, YouTube is a mess.

Goal : Be straight  Obstacle : Bearded Davie
In community poll, Beard reveal didn't get 69% vote..... We live in a community.........
It might be a way to boost your numbers by appearing at other big channels like "Warp Zone" or "Viva La Dirt League", or something of your taste. Many of those 9.66M don't really play BASS or even have one.
U look like ryan the intern when he got back to the scranton branch after the incident.
Most of your latest vids have more than a million wiews each. It might not sound alot when you say that only 10% of people subbed watch your videos but those 10% is still about a million views which is a very much healthy channel

Who is this davie504 imposter
I liked this video. Don't let the drive for improvement mess with your head too much. What got you this far was your humor, skills and creativity. These get lost when you are too obsessed and stressed. Take it easy, get away from YouTube and computers for a while and make sure your batteries are recharged. And then don't worry too much about growing your channel. Be happy first - us subscribers will always be around!
Davie if you need a break take one relax bro dont push yourself and if we stay a bit without a video nothing happened..... Everyone beeds a break

7:14 Even my small channel got affected as well. When I upload, I usually get minimum 2k views within 24 hrs, I upload daily previously. Then all of a sudden, it went down to 200 then 100, less than 100. When I asked my subs, they said they don't see my uploads unless they search it manually. It's very sad.
Bruh the beard looks epic

3:54 - what if you made LONG bass videos? Hour-long freestyle! :D< XD
I can’t remember when I subbed to Davie, or how I discovered his channel in the first place, but I believe he was only about 900k subs  It didn’t feel like a long time ago to be honest but it definitely is
I dunno about you guys, but for me, this is wholesome.
Weight lifting and strength training will take you to the next level (+10m?!?). go for it and good luck!!

Keep doing what you are doing davie. I know people say “I wanna see more bass” or “I wanna see real personality” but sometimes that is just not feasible with the YouTube algorithm. This channel is your career and you have to play the game to support yourself. Videos like this every once and a while are great to show that you have a real personality and are genuinely a great human. Content creators have to adapt, and unfortunately I think you are reaching that stage now where you kinda have to shift from pure bass videos to videos with talking and bass. The content you have been putting out recently is by far my favorite, and you are rocking it in terms of quality, at least from a viewers perspective. There is bound to be an algorithm change when you reach 10 mil, so just keep pushing along and I’m sure the views will start to pick up again. And even if they don’t, just know that every single viewer you have loves you as a person and will do anything they can to make sure you grow as a channel and a human. Thank you for the quality videos, especially during the peak of the pandemic. While everything was crazy and the world was turning upside down inside out, you continued to push out quality content on a consistent schedule. You made our sad days better and helped us get through tough times just by doing what you do. I’m sure that I’m speaking for everyone when I say that I am infinitely grateful for you and that I wish you the absolute best. I love you davie, Zach
Lol was that sora the troll ...... Creep
🅱️
Dude, I really enjoyed this video, stay chill because this is just a "bad phase", you'll pass through this, man! Much love and much BASS...
Keep yer beard!!
When are you going to make that girl Mrs. 504?
I would love a vlog series, where you take us on your day to day and just be your normal self!
You shouldn't set goals you can't control. You can set a goal to work x amount of hours on a video, or learn a new skill, or build a home.  These are goals you can control with your own will power. But setting goals like "10M subscribers" is a really bad goal because it's something that's completely out of your control. That's gonna mess up your mental health
Wtf auronplay

When did you started playing slap on bass

Sei una bella persona Davide, prenditi il tuo tempo <3
many mainstream musicians started on youtube, like justin beiber *inserts shawn mendes' image*
Finally you lokz like human being just slap lik this
Oh you like a real Italiano! Is this offensive? It shouldn't be.

Videos like this are really special IMO. I've followed a bunch of people with sub counts this high and Davie is the only one who truly does speak honestly. No pretense, no character, not hearing answers to look a certain way. Just from the heart.
Cheers from Chile Davie .. It is never enough to say thank you for the smile and great moments you gave me during the journey of watching all your videos. Never give up ... take a break if you need it ... Stay funky man, but most importantly, stay healthy.

Ciao Davie, in mezzo a tanti commenti inglesi, ci tenevo ad augurarti una pronta guarigione. Sei uno dei miei creator preferiti, e con i miei amici ci facciamo sempre un sacco di risate quando guardiamo i tuoi video, ed è sempre bello vedere quando un connazionale riesce a sfondare così tanto all'estero. Daje tutta, ti aspettiamo più BASS che mai ❤️

With davie working out now, his slaps are only gonna get harder 😤😰
So much love for you Davie! I send you my hugs 🤗 Even though I don't know you personally, i feel your kind heart and i feel your a great guy. I want you to know that no matter what happens you will always be loved, and you are worthy. Worthy of life, and love. You are a precious soul. Don't let the the thoughts in your head become giants. Their just small dogs barking loudly. Check out Doc_amen out on Instagram Love from Sweden

F. but davie with beard not bad at all haha
Davie actually looks cute like the gentleman he is😏
:000000000
Its not that youtube is bad. Tiktok is home for lifeless people and videos are a lot slower even if they skip your video it will count as a view. Think of the tiktok views as times your video has gotten into their feed and this number is a lot higher in  youtube
Davie, I absolutely love you, you motivate me to move forward and to keep making music
SDAIAY with beard...
You not look epic🙁
Somehow he looks like 40 and 17

Ngl davie with a beard looks like an indian to mee
You're doing great 👍
Davie, two weeks ago I decided to go back to BASS after 15 years - because of you.  I tried to become a bassist when there was no YT to help with the process. If you couldn't afford private lessons, you were basically on your own. I got stuck and ended up believing that I'm just not good enough to even try. Then 3 weeks ago one of your videos randomly popped up in my recommend and since then I binge watched your channel.  Your life story and love for Bass got me so excited that I really started to feel I could actually overcome one of my biggest insecurities and try again.  You are a huge inspiration to so many people, you bring joy and make the world better with your big SLAP energy. For that I will be forever grateful, thank you!!  And now please excuse me, I'm off to practice for another two hours 😊  PS. Please be good to yourself. Take all the time and care you need for your mental and physical health. YT burnout is a real thing... No one should feel such pressure.  It might be scary but remember that nothing lasts forever. These platforms change constantly, forcing their users to desperately change their tactics and themes in order to stay on the surface. In the end what is somebody's home for art and creativity is just a source of money for those who create and control it.  In some time there will be another big thing for creative people and YT will die out, as it already happend with MySpace, DeviantArt, Facebook... now Instagram is going down and YT probably will be next. It's a struggle. But there will come another invention that will give us a platform and opportunities to create what we love and to share it. We just cannot let it consume us.  Please remember that your mental health comes first!
WTF davie u look like Nas from Nas Daily. HAHAHAHAHHA
❤
Am i the only one that thinks Davie looks super cool with the beard??

Stay healthy! :)
You look like the age of a kebab pizza, Dave.
Barry Allen ✅
Stay funky bro🤣
Why the piano music on this video, why no bass?? <3
F hope you and your Beard stay healthy
Davie would've been a great goalkeeper because of his height and slapping abilities. Slapping the ball out of the goal like a boss.

u look like salim merchant from India
Ayo Davie, don't need to be stressed about your subcount and worry if your videos will not perform, many big youtubers that I watch and probably you watch too all have been through this after their channel blew up and then went down and stayed the same. Still many of them are still here and are doing well after a huge shift in content style and doing what they like. I know your vids were originally about bass as I used to regularly watch you even back in 2017. I remember you live streamed you paying bass till you passed 1 mil and back then it felt like everyone was happy for you. Its hard to tell, but I think that you are just in that phase where you aren't performing as much as you did back then and maybe in the future you'll get out of it and be happy doing what you like again. I'm not a youtube obviously but the feelings you've been experiencing recently can be said for anything that takes a lot of effort and I think that you should do what you want, not what the algorithm wants and people may catch on and you'd begin to enjoy content creation again. Sorry for the Ted talk I just felt like this was nessecary because I've never seen you express yourself to us before and that beard usually means that you are probably emotionally drained as you said in the video and us fans want to make sure you are happy making videos and happy outside of YouTube.
F
Davie secondo me devi capire che se il canale cresce meno velocemente non è colpa tua. Sono trend... ci sta che ci sia un momento di massima visibilità e poi un po' meno. Quello che conta è che comunque tu abbia una community unita, fedele e che ti supporti, cosa che mi sembra vera. Grazie per tutto quello che fai per noi.  Ho scritto in italiano perché non avevo voglia di pensarci in inglese
I know this is a QnA but hmmm.. Where's the BASS?
That was awesome, Davie504! Thank you for all you do for us.  I am a recent subscriber and I watch all of your videos. I'm in the process of going back and watching ALL of them.  Very entertaining ... epic. ✌🏻💜😇
May the force be with you my friend. BTW beard looks *EPIC* on you.

F
beard epik
It's not about money its about BASS.
Leave the beard, it gives an  'i don't give a fu/k' vibe.. it goes nicely with your youtube personality :)
i think its okay , just slap him , he will back be normal and healthy again what he needs right now is a razor like a Rambo in a movie , guys do you know what will happen after Rambo cut his beard ? ..... dynamite everywhere
Chad504
F
the "no money" was the most stupid question istg-
Don't worry about the numbers or the channel growth, just the music and the video quality. 10 million subs will come inevitably. In the meantime, you have loyal fans who rejoice every time we get a notification from you! Stay funky bro.
You look good with a beard
f
U know this is a serious video when you see davie without headphones on the thumbnail
I'm subscribed with notifications and I watch and like all of your videos, Davie🤘❤️
You made me discover bass and appreciate it to the point where I now own 2(electric and accoustic) Take you time Davie, health is the most important thing in the world(after bass) and you should take care of yourself anytime. Thanks a lot Davie for making me discover a new hobby! And of course... Stay funky, bro!

I pressed F in the CHAD, cause you're a chad.  Take all the time you need. I can't imagine the exhaustion you must sometimes feel, uploading the amount you do.
definitely keep the beard
5:07 "Chess is the best video game of all time. Can't wait for chess 2"  I died XD
Keep the beard!!
The beard looks really good on you, btw.
Grow a beard
omg
i guess you definetely should tAke a break to watch anime. YouTube is a work that never stops, so you shouldnt overwork yourself
If you need to take a break, just do it brow, you're awesome the way you are, even been a caracter or your own self, and everyone needs to rest, even to be more productive, health for you davie!!

F
Beards Around Sthe Sworld
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Davie, can you do a house tour?
The beard is awesome. Please feel free to keep it as a personal favor to me. 🙂 No SDAIAY is fine, but a therapy session would be kool. Please play bass in every video, even if it’s subliminal. We need your bass! I hope you feel better soon. Sorry YouTube is messed up. Remember many of us are still out here watching and standing by for the next video.  🙂🥰❤️🎸😎👍🏻💐
F
Hey man dont think abt the numbers man
F
SORA THE TROLL!!!!!!!!!!
What is yout oppinion about Valentino Rossi Retirement?
F. Also, the YouTube algorithm test you did was impressive. The algorithm is the worst part of YouTube, hands down. The fact that when I'm subbed to more than 100 creators and when I refresh the "recommendation" page, it shows me the exact same videos I've ignored for the past three days instead of any from the people I'm subbed to proves YouTube is broken as hell.
Take care Davie
Should definitely keep the beard
My cousin grows the exact shape of beard. I hope you actually grow it out a bit more before unrevealing it.
I like the beard. Keep it!
I bought my first bass today fam,
Gaming channel reveal?
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
*phone rings* I pick up:  "Who dis?"  "Hey, it's me, Davie's beard. Somebody please help me! He's gonna kill me!" "What? But you look amazing! Most guys would kill for a beard like that!" "I know right? But society's beauty standards are bullshit! They all just want shaved face, shaved body, shaved ice, everything shaved. Oh no, he's coming back! Don't let him..."
i really love your beard
You are doing so well Davie, we all love you and are behind you. You will make it to 10 so goddamn soon dude, we are here for the long haul bro
Davie had a beard, NANI??
Youtube Algorithm works in mysterious ways!
I hope you will do only Bass/no talking videos again. I like talking videos, but I watch only Bass videos more often just to listen to you playing. Maybe one day you will upload an at least 30 Minute only Bass video. That would be great! ❤️
If you have covid please give me some. I need it so I will keep my work! Thanks!
so you like venezuela? liar
@SoraTheTroll made it?!?! ❤
Is it just me or is it weird that this is your 666th video? LOL
7:00 that's hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Bella barba!
Of all Davies i've seen, this is the most handsome. It compares to the power of bass
Slap like.
I have been enjoying BASS (Bass Around Sthe Sworld) videos.  Keep it up, you are doing fine !
Davie Bear Biale
OMG IT IS THE MAIN CHARACTER IN GTA LIBERTY CITY
You look indian ngl
You should definitely wear a beard, funky bro 🤟 it fits you very well
What's your current chess elo? I wonder if you can find a way to move the pieces using the bass for a YouTube video...or maybe that's too complex.
wow, beard
I for one actually really like the unshaven look u should keep it
Pensavo di aver aperto un video di davie 504, non uno di Mondo Marcio..
Bla bla bla continue .......
Yeah YouTube puts too much garbage in the recommended too often and we don't see new uploads when we should sometimes from channels we are subscribed to
Who said only Bass playing videos get less views ? I mean , check out the older videos where Davie plays- only slap bass or challenge videos or playing 24 strings bass etc got millions of videos . But now a days ,it gets less views because of - well , Davie already said it .
Silly people ask questions like "How's the music going?". Their understanding of playing music contains an end goal, making money or being famous, as if making music were not its own reward.
Old man Davie
Rocky
Rescue a cat and teach it how to play bass ez 1 Million subs. hope it helps.
Is beard unhealthy?
stay healthy friend!!
F
Epic beard omg
Careful I heard chess 2 is going to suck. Remember not to preorder and wait to see.
I held a bass without your permission, will you forgive me?
Tobey became a youtuber now?
F
That piano backsound changes the mood, in a positive way
I have a question for you. When are you gonna play some 🍕?
F
I know you don't care about the opinions of strangers on the internet, but I rather like the beard and would certainly not mind if you kept it in future videos.
Missing SLAP LIKE NOW
You look a newly father it kinda look bad , but I kinda like it 😏😳
F
Next time shave during the video
beards fresh bro. your always lowkey so funny tho
'' O7 / |  / \ respect cuz u're swet and sweat bro  <3 remember to drink lot of water, stay healthy.  remember to don't drink too cold water.  if put it in fridge check it by SLAPPing bottle, if it istant freeze don't drink it, not heathy <3
You should keep your beard
Why
Like it or not there already is a Chess 2 on steam... Also F
Although you aren't muscles...,but you can't get fat either!!😂🙋😻
Thank you. OMG!
NO BASS!  Where's the BASS?  I was told there would be BASS!!
Omg davie with muscles would be HUGE
Cool video 👍 take you're time and stay healthy 😉 You are the best😄
Hey Davie, you've probably been suggested this before but how about making music albums on Bandcamp and vlogging about the process? It'd be a fresh series, be musical and could attract a new audience.
His beard looks. Cool
Do you still have the squier bass VI???????
Lol it was sora the troll
F
Ngl the beard looks good, maybe turn it into a goatee?
Loved the beard. Looking good
f
You inspired me to play bass for real
I unironically laughed at the Wikipedia article reaction.
F, beard chan :(
Who's your favorite Italian futbol player
Beard? Oh Shit
Wow. new look.
He looks so fucking good with a beard
I actually like it
07:37 oh man, I've noticed the same thing on my YouTube channel vs my Twitter page. It hurts to hear that it affects giant channels like yours too. On the other side tho, I hope you'll post more bass stuff on TikTok, Instagram Reels etc. since the algorithms there actually love music posts, unlike YouTube sometimes. Plus, the moments when you play bass are always my favorite parts of your videos!
F
Hi Davie, hope you are doing fine and taking care of yourself, dont worry about reaching 10M subs, you (without a doubt) will very soon!
Question: Who inspired you to play BASS? David504: Davie504
You look better with that beard.
If possible Davie stay away from social media, seek more natural things in life, like personal conversations, walk on the park, nature... things like that, stay healthy best slapper on youtube
🅱️ASS has made you hilarious 👍 great video
F
We love you Davie! Take care, of yourself. if you need to, take some time off to slap some guitarists and come back when you're ready.
Random guy: Your camara is bad! Me: Stop watching youtube in 144p, checkmate!
Beard makes you look more like rocky .. Sylvester Stallone 😛
Davie You look epic man 👍🏼😎
666 videos 😨
You should keep the beard!
Keep the beard, then do frosted tips to match your hair.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)👍
Davie should become a streamer since he mentioned he plays a bunch of games.
F
Not gonna lie to you Davie, for 2 years of watching U, the content has changed a bit, and every single time I felt anxious at best. But at the moment I have no trouble to see, how good it is 4 U just to talk to US. Playin' bass is fine and creates some "surrouding" to your personality. I truly believe, once U choose to change this channel to be more about U than bass, numbers [even though U don't seem to care much] will increase as well as the impact of the videos.  cheers bro
F
3:14 I am one of them, thanks!
stay healthy men
when gf's beard reveal?
I am still here davie, waiting for your battle with alip bata.
Mental health is something that most of the people ignore, but on a serious note, being mentally healthy is as important, or even more important than being physically healthy. It is good that youtubers are actually talking about this and for this, they have my respect.
Bass and health are equally important, so stay healthy!
Next question  Nxt qesion  Nx qsn Nx q N q N . . . . .

Beard is copyrighted by me.

H e l t h
Hope u feel. Better
I want big beard reveal!
Do you think you could slap that beard off your face or are you going to have to shave it like the rest of us mere mortals have to do?
This video is uploaded to Davie504 channel. But in this video, we saw Davide Biale. This should be correct. (Or not?)
Ngl Davie looks really handsome with beard
Not gonna lie but I prefer seeing Davie with a beard
The beard balances out your face
Davieee, you look great with beard, you should keep it
Beard looks great..!!
Davie looks way better with a beard
davie, that beard is hella nice. Can i buy it?
F
F
oh... Hi Sly
I started following you when you were having 50 k but now very soon you will reach 1M its a amazing motivation for others and also for you
f for the beard it's looks nice on you btw
Nice
Davide Biale can you play the accordion on your next video?
Your beard doesn't make you look older. Looks fine.
What you gonna do if Youtube decide to stop? Keep the beard
It might work out well to create some compilations of your bass playing from past videos.  Increase watch time without having to do too much work and just show off a bunch of your bass skills.
Uomo barbuto, uomo cazzuto
WHAT DAVIE504 white hair and beard omg
davide beard? he is so... hot! 🥵
You should use Minoxidil 5% to have full beard, believe me, really works hehe
no OMG in the end...... :(.....
yoooo davie.. ngl that beard looks so freaking good on you. I will slap like on all your videos from now on if you keep that beard ahahha
F
don't pressure your self👍 just enjoy everything..
from one bearded man to another I gotta say, you look pretty good

I like the beard. I wish you would keep it, it looks good. SLAPP THE LIKE BUTTON

F

f
F
6:53 Wow, you must be *super* skinny. I'm 5'7" and 82 (slightly overweight).
Actually like the beard F. Nice, I think, to a certain extent you have narrowed what SDAIAY is by making those memes a big part of your channel. So when a fan sees a man and sends it to you it's usually similar to the rest of the memes.
Stay healthy, Davie! 🙌🏻
Круто нарастил на лице
3:14 I'm one of those people and I'm really happy that i got into bass. It just makes me fell happy and chill. I recently bout a new bass and i play it 24/7 only because of you! Thank you and keep up the good content!

Keep it up. I love your sincerity and your humor. And of course, your bASS.

Pls davie beard reveal
6:51 missed opportunity to say you're 6 feet 9 inches
oh hi sora
You look stunning with the beard, but you also look 35 years old…
beard opinion:  it's press bas(s)ic       But I'm glad you're doing okay and not dead. Or maybe you dead, live your best (un)life. Play chess and chill man.
Very impressive, but can you react 2020 em uma música by Lucas Inutilismo?? 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

These videos, or you just playing bass, are my favourite of yours, Davie. Honestly I just skip the meme content, so it was nice to hear you say you're growing bored of them as well. Stay funky, bro.

F davies beard
Omgg!! Can't wait for Davie's onlyfans!!!
Hey, I'm 1 of the 2 people you inspired to play bass. I bought my bass after watching some of your videos in April 2019. And I've been following your channel since then. And a fun fact: Some weeks ago I was checking the first videos of my favorites list and one of them is Funk Bass Groove, your video from 2011. I had 3 of your videos in my fav list before actually knowing "Davie504". :D
I'm subscribed and on youtube often during the day, I never saw that video mentioned at ~8min uploaded or suggested.
You look better without beard
Davie in his final form of Sylvester Stallone
We love you Davie, take as long as you want, your heatlh is more important than all the videos, stay funky bro

When Davie504, look like David Blaine with his beard. I wonder who is the most powerful between the two of you.
Rush e on bass
First of all you look damn good with a beard… and I watched all your videos again and again …. You inspire me and I have subscribed with my 3 different channels…. And don’t shave
Next question
F
Davie: Hi Me: WHATTT??!!
Bearded Davie is the best timeline Davie
MY DUDE!!! he actually showed emotion in the if bass made no money question... his appreciation for base was seen on his face and his joy talking about it was clear even in his tone. The ONLY thing that makes Davie show feelings is BASE! WHAT A LEGEND
F
You are a wonderful person and I really enjoy watching ALL your videos. I wish you health, wealth, and happiness. But most of all, I wish for you to have 1000 small blessings each day and the vision to see them.
I hope you get discovered someday
Davie wants me to press F in chat but I press B instead. Because there's no F in bass... unless we talk about notes.
F beard
Stay safe bro
I hope you stay alright man, until the next video.

How bad is the camera? The beard has always been there, it just didn't show up on the camera.  Get better Davie. I figured you were just on some fun adventure in bass land.
video idea: playing bass outside youtube hq until they fix the algorithm

When you came to Costa Rica? XD
Why do you need to reach 10M subs? I mean, it's fine to have a constant amount of subs! Look at Quei Due Sul Server (I know you know Synergo), they have an almost constant amount of subscribers but it's one of the most loved channels on YouTube! The only thing that matters is that you have fun and the money you get are enough to sustain your life. Who cares if you make 10M subs tomorrow or in a year.
f  i dig the stubble
Don't overcook it - stay al dente and just make videos as they come to you. No sense trying to speedrun 10M subs, you'll get there.
'F' for the beard.
Slap like for beard! Or we call FBI  <3
F for The beard.  Btw.  Could you play some ZZ Top for Dusty Hill's sake?

“I already look older than my age without my beard” LMAOO
Your channel has as many subs as Hungary has people.  You run an entire country.
Review other subreddits… might be hilarious
I'd actually enjoy more serious videos just as well. Please don't let the numbers, statistics etc. make you worry, as long as you are doing fine financially. We don't wanna see what the algorithms like, we want to know what you like!
I like your beard
Chad Davie504
Do more game music from ur bass like u did with amog us
You need to take some long vacations Davie! It has to be overwhelming to produce that my videos constantly. Good luck with everything.
"We live in a SOCiETY" -Davie504 2021
I noticed you mentioned playing a lot of video games. Have you considered streaming what you play? It might give you a little boost. Anyway, don't worry so much about algorithms and views and reach. Your videos are excellent and you should be proud of what you have done and become. Just relax, my friend. You're a great content producer 😎🔥💪🏼
I'm suprised there was no "OMG" at the end
Why your eyes look like that??ffffffff beard
I'm a straight guy but to be honest you look really good with that beard. Looking older doesnt necessarily mean looking worse.
You're awesome with a beard Davie. You're awesome without a beard Davie. Actually, it doesn't matter what you look like. Stay funky, bro. 💖

3:14 No one asked me but, I discovered your channel many years ago and before that, I never acknowledged that bass is the backbone of music in any genre. Since then, I asked my parents for a bass for my birthday and started playing 24/7 because I fell in love with it, later I joined a band and started adding fills and solos to spice up things and man, people loved it! Thanks Davie.
I'm good. I tried sending you a slap yet I get I'm bad and you are busy. I wouldn't unsubscribe just because of that. 😅

I feel davie is more depressed on this video not like in other.
2 weeks? It looks like 25 years
We're not mad, Davie. Just disappointed.  In us.  We thought becoming FKA bass players would be good enough. Now, we have to start taking care of ourselves.  Please stop, before you kill us with self improvement.
Working out is the best thing that i have done this year, hope your health journey goes well too. Maybe we will see Chad Davie slapping bass soon. please do work out vlog/meme along the way, share us your experience. Much love
