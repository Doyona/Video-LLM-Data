C Ř Ä B  MAN
15:31 he took “minimum wage” to a whole new minimum 😂😂😂
watching this having no idea what this game is, who these people are, or any idea whats going on is a fun ride
When the title says, "Making a One Man Army", and it's a lie as it's one man WITH an army.
"Tzeentch is a massive ASSHOLE" what fun it is to cause general shenanigans
"Congress take notes" did not age well😭🤣
I need more of thiss!!!!
Please do all seasons have been loving how much you love this show!!!😊
8:36 tap this multiple times
6:03 I swear it’s always the random empire 20 stack, leave me alone bro, leave me in peace, these mfers have been causing problems since the damn second game
All Hail God Noctilus!

What's the music starting at around 12 minutes?
or can someone make a similar video
can we get a remake of this plz ?
You make it look so easy but I always get pooped on every game 😑
imagine being the elves during this and then sending that save file to legendoftotalwar
Your narration and editing is so engaging and on point! Happy to have come across this channel
I came back to this video cause it is what got me into warhammer. Into Reggie , grim kleaper, and stupidity

Yarrrrrr
ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY! HE'S ARISEN FROM THE SEA.
hi
Could a necrofex colossus be considered mecha
manifest destiny as pirates is nice, good sir.
bro just discovered you today.  You're a funny guy.  Subbed instantly after the crab joke. (you know the one)
VIVA PIÑATA MENTIONED!?
Lmfao great work and huge style points hilarious content@@#$keep it up bud.
3 questions: 1. Where has this guy been all my life?  2. Why doesn’t he have more followers? 3. Why did I need to discover him through a Wirtual video comment section?!
I think the ending songs lyrics go like this “Hail the mighty” “He’s a rising from the deep” “wind tattered sails and incredible tales we’re calling on the sea”
Enlisted
I swear, your accent makes Khatep sound like you're calling him Content.
Love this!
A VIVA PINATA REFERENCE?!! IN THIS ECONOMY?!!
17:27 noctalus goes straight.       Every body else indiscriminately annihilate                Those are some great bars🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
12:35 MEGAMIND REFRENCE!!!
This is like if the rumbling had cannons
"banana chinned man with a sharp stick"
good
This was so good
why is it starcraft music XD
This was amazing  Kairos "JP Morgan" Fateweaver🤣🤣🤣
28:18 living in a small town be like
31:57 Pacifism for the peace god I can't, I just can't! 🤣🤣🤣
So did every faction die or nah?
14:24 made me laugh the most
"Lining the entire ocean in some sort of... Vampire Coast." 🔥🔥🔥
Thank you YouTube I love mobile game ads every three minutes I'm sure this in no way harms content creators ability to retain viewers.
34:25 what song is this?
Fun fact, if Penny Cox goes the entire game without going to war, you get an achievement "Penny Pax". Don't believe me? Google it.
Oh thank you for listing the first song, I've been trying to figure it out for years since I first heard it on some youtube video. No one that has used it hasn't listed it (Okay by 13ounce)
"pulling X out of my ass was surprisingly lubeless" is an amazing neologism
Gor-Rok siting on the sidlines having already sieged down multiple city’s, single handedly ended entire army’s in the hero only challenge video on his own only for a dead pirate to only siege down one city and calling him the one man army is one of the funniest and saddest thing I have ever seen
If you could speak like a sober person, one would enjoy your channel.
*Declare war on all factions.”  Isn’t that basically the Imperium of Man?
10:20 ah yes murder Barbie the best elf
3rd or 4th time watching this lol
PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME
16:24 wtf is that :D
11:55 I did not expect my favorite game of all time to be referenced wtf
6:46 smash
Unironically, crab invasion is a real thing.
Not a chance you'll see this comment a year from posting, but, even watching this video for the third time, "they are heavily armed, but we are heavily legged" has gotten me every time.
5:00
2:18 End of ad
Lmfao. W video😂
i feel the same way about the dude who posted all the solutions to the rune puzzels from WH2 online.
The only good part abt not being able to get sigvalds trait because of Be’lakor is that be’lakors defeat trait is still pretty good
I just got into the warhammer universe at 26yo. Total war 3 is my first game. I’ve been overwhelmed trying to figure this sh** out. It’s like Stellaris all over again lmao.
No business, no deal, and i threaten you with a gun. Ah the dupont approach.
one man army you said...
Bro please try out bannerlord 2 im begging
A man of war on a man of war
what dlc's?
I have watched this video more times then I am ever willing to admit.😅
“There Is No War In Galleon’s Graveyard.”

The pvz music is good
COUNT NOCTILUS REINGS
23:29 The Moment when you see you Friend in a Free for All match
The Brigador OST hell yeah
i couldnt smash like and sub faster
23:09 you’re welcome kleaper. (But fr I am playing karios rn)
26:41 😂😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The best part about these videos is how hard it is to tell whether or not yr'oue winning
I luv curling up next to my girlfriend, in front of a warm fire, with hot cocoa, and flicking on this video
Wait a minute you turned noctolus into end times setra
What is the name of the song at the end
Great video
We start the campaign by doxing every leader's home address so we can send them a big middle finger in the mail.
Pulling an entire army out of my a$$ is surprisingly lubeless 😂😂😂dawg tf
“COUNT NAUCTULUS🔥🔥 I hate snow🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️”
22:54 If it was 20% + 30% + 8%, then where did the last 5% come from to make 63%?
Uncle Noctilus and Manifest Destiny
14:19 And yes there was one thing to do, and you nailed it
11:33 hol'up something's not right here
This video almost killed me because of how funny it was XD
I think one of my favorite parts of your videos is just the Terran music from StarCraft.
BIG DADDY PIRATE and HIS FRIENDS
Loved the video, made me start playing and the first game of Warhammer 3 I did was  vampire coast with cylostra and by turn 12 I found out you can have her legendary hero have 43 percent ward save kinda broken
The name of the video is literally clickbait. Why is the tww community so degenerate, i don’t know
Says over 275 factions when its 276, classic Advertising Scumbag Behavior (I do that with literally everything I can its so easy)
iwould pay a hundred bucks just to get this guy report on Cnn News anchor
The auto resolve thinks this is a crushing defeat, witch isn’t wrong but for whom lol
Love this version of Warhammer cause I’m a fantasy freak but my computer just can’t handle it
The advantage technique for marking all of the other factions, “Doing it manually” had me almost having to seek medical attention as my sides were hurting from laughing so much! 😂😂😂😂0:49
lol you single handedly convinced me to buy and play vampire coast. FYI guys is there any deal has it on sale for $8
"Pulling an entire army out of my ass is surprisingly lubeless" that's a quote
only vampire pirates get to pilot gundams in warhammer.
is this modded?
"A whopping 1.1k weapon strength" *Laughs in Skarbrand*
3:55 that got me
2:55 🦅🦅🦅Accuracy through volume! *YeeHaaa!* 🦅🦅🦅
Anyone know the shanty at the end?
16:50 im i seeing Count Noctilus doing the rumbling ?
One man army must mean something different these days. I miss the good ol days when people spoke the truth instead of resorting to dishonest baiting.
"What a sigmar?" 🐙
Have you ever played 1 minute of Warthunder?
VIVA PINATA  MENTIONED
What’s the song at 34:05
15:12 level 5 WHAT  ???
ork see dakka ork watch ork smile
Very well made and cut. Also I am sure you never took a breath during all of it, I couldnt even keep up with everything LUL
The floating pizza was 👌
Gun
After dealing with the high elfs i had to deal with the slightly more sober elfs lmao
Forgive me for it I needed somewhere to complain. As a newcomer this has to be the most insanely gatekeeped greedy game in the history of the business. What do you mean you have to buy warhammer 1 to play Karl Franz and there’s $300 of dlc after you already paid for the game
Do I play this game? no.. Do I know anything about this ip? no.. Did I watch the whole video? I need help..
Daaaamn, finally, the content we deserve . Thank you so much ^^
noctilus has no use for siege ladders
26:31 omg the puns x-DD
25:18 oh no, not the 'slightly more sober elves' x-D
25:59 you gonna take that Charlie?
Man advertised a one man army, then raises a second lord at 13:35. I want my 14 minutes back.
"Bye Karl" 😂😂
"The only end game crisis I couldn't find were the Skaven"  Uh oh.
Why are there armies like Bretonnia and the elves when gunpowder is a thing? I mean I suppose the elves do have magic, though I didn't really see them use it, and crossbows and bows might be faster at shooting that hand cannons or muskets or whatever, but you're using freaking canons mounted  to giant undead pirate mechs! You'd think they'd at least enter the early modern era and adopt pike and shot tactics, but no. Me knight. Me like riding horsey.
Today we learn that a necromancer with an army of undead is, according to this guy, just one person.
That last fight was personal
Do a campaign where you can only auto resolve
Turning Warhammer into Warhammer 40K by creating the God Emperor...
dawg I remember playing Viva Pinata on the xbox, that game was lit asf, you just hit a childhood memory
I would love to see this challenge done with Orion since wars decrease his upkeep!
For a one man army, you have a lot of units

bro made a one piece pirate
I like this
2:00 where to get this decal?
Nah not the pvz music in the background
Medallion of the Nautical Psychopath
Subscribing for the line of "pulling an entire army out of my ass was surprisingly lube-less" I actually laughed out loud.
faster than Jehovahs Wintness
The sea shanty at the enf gave me chills
Huh. So maybe the reason I suck at Vampire Coast is that I keep bringing melee to a gun fight.
It’d be pretty interesting to witness the effects of declaring war on the entire world turn 1 on the global map.  All the factions that normally would declare war on each other might ally because they share one war against an enemy that’s half the world away. You might actually have caused more peace than war here
Idea for a very cool class of mage: militar mage! They use their magic not to cast spells but to manifacure multiple kinds of fire (and stuff alike) along side their ammo in less than visible time. Creating things like rebolvers, pistols, grenades/bombs, flametrowers, artillery weapons (cannon, missles, "greater bombs" ect.), and other types of more advanced wepons than stick sised spears to use against their enemy. The down side? Unless the element in question is ice or fire, those mages cannot cast any kind of elemental magic to be more efective against creatures weak to said elements. They also just can't cast other types of magic at all! Healing, cursing, buffing ect. Is non-existing for these mages spell polls. Would _you_ be a militar mage in a fantasy world setting?   Edit: also i'm writting on my phone and it's kinda dog shit
“Hey hey people…”
Me spinning because I’m mentally deranged: The zombies watching me: OH FRICK THAT
Do you smell pestilence
He should do another now that Elspeth is around with her defeat trait lol
im not that many games into tw:wh3 (handful or so) but its always vampire coast factions claiming the sword in my runs. 50 turns in the "donut" is split in three between high elf, dark elf and vampire coast. so far my greatest achivement was as the free to play demon of chaos faction and taking over the donut and ofc as its elves i had to take every city in the name of slaanesh. playing as a warrior of chaos is fun. to make the world map belong to one only. or demon of chaos and split the world between them all. north is blood god, donut and mid west is for obvoius reasons god of excess. empire and breton is for god of change, lizard and bad lands i give to grandpa nurgle and the rest i try to split depending on what faction the city belonged to as i took it.
What is the music at the end, I love it and I want it TwT
How long did your editing take? I just watched the whole video and loved it. Great job 👏
10:35 does this man play FTL??????????????????
If you not bate computer, Noctilus will lose. It is false
WAAAAAAAAGH!
The devs knew exactly what they were doing with the name of Booty Catcher. 😂
Ôi bố sợ quá bố sợ quá skill khủng quá lmao
Non vãi, một lũ losers ảo tưởng world war lmao  Everyone has the right to dream, but even the dream of losers suck
Bây giờ mà còn hi vọng world war  Bây giờ là world domination thôi, ko có war  vì ko ai dám chống lại
OMG! Claiming the Sword of Khaine is lore-accurate now!
In summary: this is one piece
"Mouseilion" hurt my soul
11:32 comedy gold
beatbox champion got me  on the floor
This is the first wor hammer video i show but got bord and left
What's the music in the background at 4:38?
20:33 this fucking killed me
Decepticon of the Sea for sure 😁🌊😅🤣
What would have happened if Noctilus wasnt stopped in Dreadfleet
Man I really want to try this game but I just can't get over the $300 pricetag...
America magic: *second amendment*
lining the entire ocean in some sort of "vampire coast"
whats the mod?
Brood war called they want the Terran track back
This channel’s sponsor segments are the only ones I actually watch
one year later and I just realized, Franz hit hard because he had magic attacks and was ignoring phys resist, magic attacks are only reduced by actual ward save and armor
bro the fucking vampirate shanty goes so hard
internet historian ahh soundtrack
*THE LONGER THE SWORD OF KHAINE IS ON EARTH THE STRONGER IT BECOMES*
Count Noctilus just trying to track everyone down to talk to them about their extended warranty.
Hi
Im not sure if your a copy of Reggie or if hes a copy of you ......
Bro. This is magnificent.
William Bootycatcher got me laughing
Imagine this but with the new nemesis crown
"But we have the sheer unwashed masses of... sheer unwashed masses!" gets me everytime XD
Count Kleaper "Jones" Noctilus, ripping the Sword of Khaine from, presumably, his chest: Nice Sword, I think I'll keep it
2 full stacks on turn 10? cheating AI.
It's funny that every Warhammer player makes the same gag about dark elves
35:18 / 35:18
I’m ngl, Pacifism for the Peace God did me in.
+1
25:12 should have been "Noctilus hotboxed a turn by smoking four 20 stacks of high elves and getting a contact high from drinking their blood."
As one of jehivahs witnesses, i enjoy the call out. We are pretty good at finding people
My 5th time re-watching. Any time he posts he make a amazing peice of history, one of the greats.
Is it just me or is the RoR of the necroflex worse than the regular necroflex
This is actually the best intro to any youtube video I have ever seen. The music combined with your humour, voice, and actual discription of what you will be doing makes for the perfect intro.
"Tzeentch is a massive asshole" Im glad im not the only who detests him in Total War
Do you have to finish the campaign to play the same mode as you or what?
26:40 Make you're bed!
Does anyone else get @reginald  vibes? Like every detail is so similar. It’s just so good, the kind of YouTubers I need are falling in line. I don’t even care if they are all carbon copies of one another.
I like how I’m two minutes into the video and he’s already making war crime jokes 😂
I think I've watched this video too much... Noctilus has started showing up in my dreams
Being Cambodian made that random ass line side-splittingly hilarious. Just as I was thinking "Wait a minute... We're not Thai!" the map marker in Japan popped up and elevated the joke from a belly laugh to an outright wheezing one. Very well played, my dude. Very well played indeed.
Anwser. GUN.
They are heavily armed but we are heavily legged 😂😂
i dont see a 1 men army ^^
This video just proves that if the Ents in 'The lord of the rings the two towers', were strapped, them orcs would've been clapped, at least those walking boat thingies kinda look like Ents...
i have a noctolis run where he is invincible and has never lost a battle
I reckon Orion due to his 8% bonus or manus dark blade because he’s the one man army
6:44 RAHHHH FEMBOYS MENTIONED YAYYY :3
Yo ho ho ho ho yo ho ho ho ho 34:01
The best moment in the video 9:53
Reggie with a bit less personality Still incredibly enjoyable
I'm generally curious what was your research order
I can't even escape the snail on the yt. I even got ad on instagram.
Who!?!? Who are you buying from? You're at war with everyone. Who are you paying? You're a necromancer.
anybody know the source for the meme at 24:51 ? was that a show?
idk why but I love Warhammer vids
I luv gun.🥰🥰🥰
How many kills did noctilus get in the last battle?
Sheer unwashed masses of sheer unwashed masses is by far the best army
Wtf is total warhamer? Yeah that warhamer is total! Total war warhammer... just because it sounds good does not mean it makes sense. Total war, warhammer
Brigador music in the background
necrofex stack having bad autoresolve is why I don't play dreadfleet. It's the intended way to play him, and it's cool for a while, but having to manually fight every single battle is exhausting
Well , can you call it an army if it is one man only ?
30:14 What is that image called?
18:10 anybody know the music?
"All hope of world peace"  Lets be honest, the AI was gonna fight you anyways so you are just being honest with the game.
Makeup and Vanity Set <3
I’M THE MARQUIS OF MARS, AND I DECLARE WAR ON ALL OF YOU, WAR ON ALL OF YOU
I never want to hear “surprisingly lubeless” used in this context again
How the hell does this have 4M views?!
Welcome to  the capial. It sucks here!
This reminds me of the time I modded Rimworld and unleashed the one woman Death machine called Silver on the entire max population density max coverage planet. It took ages, but she eventually destroyed every single faction that can be.   I did give her a weapon that fires anti matter mortal rounds two times a second, so the outcome of everyone else dying was expected.
If you want to auto resolve a lot  as the vampire coast use the zombie bombers the ones on foot they are broken in auto resolve being a lot better in it than in actual battle. If you want the same situation for skaven warpfire throwers are identical.
Ending the game with a revenge beatdown instead of total domination is just so you, keep it up.
All Acts:  Act I: 2:48  Act II: 17:49  Act III (Noctilus' Revenge): 34:01
So many laughs had! Thank you!
what was the name of the song you used while u oblitirated everyone
Does anyone know what music is used at 22:30
Is the Italian navy just a box of pizza? 🍕 🇮🇹
陈希汉吉 1:45
I've come back to this video quite a few times. I intend to keep coming back to it cuz this video is amazing. Can you make some amazing content. I've showed this video to my dad he has no idea what Warhammer is but he finds this video hilarious along with other videos. Keep up the great work bro you're killing🎉
Be’Lakor killing himself to spite you is something very in character for him
I'm playing war thunder right now:)
i once was belakor and i got the sword of khaine early they didnt really have a good time with a 20 stack of fully researched aspiring champions and belakor the destroyer of worlds
I wonder what the song is at the end
Wot the heck... I just came across your channel and dayum this video was a work of art
"With all the battle sites nearby, pulling an entire army out of my ass is surprisingly lube less"
Guys, can anyone provide instructions how to choose which endgame crisis will happen?
Banger. Watched whole video in one gulp, didn't notice 35 min passed!
When i played as Count Noctilus for the first time i too got my hands on the sword of kain and when Tirion showed his ass at my dorrstep he got one shotted by Noctilus
How long did you play this for?
SO enjoyable to watch. Big fan of RTS games and your commentary is gold
best warhammer 3 video i have seen till now🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,funniest
I (and The Emperor) will watch your career with GREAT interest! 😁
I already play warthunder
I have been loughing through this whole video thank you!!!
femboys of Cambodia ????
this is so ironic that Markus Wulfhart teamed up with Lizardmen in battle to fight you
Plastic solar auxilia 🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
well done! you worked hard on this, bravo!
Hi
31:45 "Khairos 'J.P. Morgan' Fateweaver" is f'ing brilliant!!! 😅
Спизженный у убиваки челлендж, на облегченных условиях
That Cambodian joke was so under rated
femboys on top
At 12:11 I had to pause the video resulting in "the lineup with my 40 groups of Gunner I had a simple plan shoot" and subsequently didn't really want to continue the video because I thought that was a pretty perfectly good plan😂
Bro became Germany 💀💀
Pulling an army out of my ass is incredibly lubeless 😅
This gives me a headache lol
i want that act 2 manifest destiny thing as a wallpaper
Not a one man army but an entertaining video nonetheless. I will downvote for clickbait
How do you have blood in the game when units are fighting ?
Very cool 👍
Call an Ambulance, call an Ambulance, but not for me.
what is the background music at 03:15? I am familiar with it and i know I own the game where it's from but I can't remember it....
Jokes on u i aleeady play warthunder for like 6 yeras now, also awesome vid thx
Best music choice on YouTube
tldr; a reenactment of world history.
One of the only channels to mix humor and good editing while still having quality content
If you wanna cheese it harder set the unit sizes to small. It scales your single entinity units HP preprotional to the unit size. But not your single entinity units damage to my understanding.
As a Markus myself, I just want to say, Wulfhart put up a good fight.  Two hits is better than one.  22:19
How did the last battle go so well 😂
22:37 William Booty Catcher
i can't imagine how long it took to create this edit, really nice one tho, hard commitment for probably minuetes long AI rounds <3.
How the f%#^ does this have 3.4 Million views ??
I honestly love to just put pirate bays everywhere instead of taking over settlements you can be at war with the entire world and have 1 single settlement and be ok because you're fielding 5 doomstacks funded by pirate bays that give you income without needing defense
As a WH3 player i couldn't understand why this WH3 video has 3,6 million views.... until i watched it to the end 😂
I think this achievement should qualify as officially *beating the game.
How does this have 3.6 mil views 380k subs and 1.7k comments but only 900 thumbs up? Its a good video too
how to get ai controll
“only jake from state farm can save us!” - Vikings, 1066

Can you please kindle do more of these Warhammer 3 stuff? Please! Man, please!
Jesus you are the best unhinged channel I've came across so far

Viva Pinata was so good
https://youtu.be/lpSgC-e_uXA?t=220 what's the music playing around in that time?
27:40 He probably hasn't, considering that just yesterday he finished uniting the Empire, then you come along fresh from burning Ulthuan to the ground and land in Bretonnia, his ally.
Count Noctilus (formerly Niklaus Von Carstein) is the pinnacle of the "fuck this, I'm gonna go be a pirate" mindset during the age of exploration. Dude used a spell to LIFT HIS CASTLE OUT OF THE GROUND AND TURN IT INTO A BOAT. He looked at the dark elf black ark and said "doesnt feel homely enough" so he just took his home with him.
I have watched the video 5months ago and youtube keeps shoving it in my "auto play next video" and you know what I continue to watch it! xD
Great editing. Too bad your voice is annoying.
I hope we get to see more factions
This was the most amazing and beautiful thing i have ever seen amazing
I want to see that infinite health happen.
That Italian navy joke just got you a subscriber
bro I am already playing war thunder, please someone get gaijin to stop sending me ads
Why i never saw a vídeo of somente winning total war warhammer by clearing the whole map? I want to the the full map in hot pink :(
I barely understand this game but I the video is a masterpiece :D
That dotA 2 trigger got me harder than i want to admit...
they may be heavily armed, but we are heavily legged!  awesome :D
"The italian navy"😂
What is even going on here. I don't even know the game. But I will watch this unholy conquest.
34:40 Damn this music slaps!
17:02 why does this remind me of that one mumakil scene from lotr ...
What mod did you use to be able to use diplomacy with every faction from turn 1? I’ve been trying to find it but can’t.
what was that song you used at the end?
16:33 “COUNT NOCTILUS!”                                                                                                                 “I hate snow.”
that was one of the best made war thunder ad i have seen so far. normal i skip them xD
Italian Navy...the sad floating pizza got me
6:23 instant classic
Loved the tucker joke made me absolutely die 😂
What is that sea shanty at the end of the videos?
Jesus is Lord and the only God Amen
I watched this masterpiece 3 times now over the last 5 months - its just fire mate.
07:53 bro really chose the bob semple tank as his tank reference
interesting
reggie copy
5:04 Elf girls be like
Use crab king next!!
how tf is this possible lol
Bro forced a popeyes biscuit of facts down their throats with no water
This should be a game mode
The extensive use of the Brigador soundtrack in a playthrough where you primarily use what are effectively wooden mechs is extremely fitting.
Count noctilus, also known as "Cheeseburger Freedomman"
Penny Cox? Like the pornstar?
34:00 what is that song?
we need a hot pink map
Hey my name is Tyrion and then I heard that it was an elf’s name and I.           Don’t know :)
I laughed at the crab joke lmao
mans just doin ww1 but undead pirates and i laughed so hard i almost broke my chaire
War Thunder is shit
amazing video, and the age of empires music got me in love
No cap, I watch this when I’m feeling down and gives me a good smile. Thank you sir 👌 prolly my fourth watch at this point
man said Gucci island
i have never played this total war at all and you made me laugh the whole time, ggz
you're genuinely funny, your writing is solid, keep it up man
Kinda like a business deal, except there is no business, there is no deal, and we threaten you with a gun. Lol
I was never involved with warhammer let alone played any of the games, but this was glorious.
Basically what happens when you give a homeless pirate zombie a cool sword 34:21
This game is so broken by magic
Whats the start song?
Brigador soundtrack detected.
No idea how I've gone years of being a Warhammer fan and never seen a single one of your videos. This has ben a hell of an experience. Subscribed 👍
This niggas funny
So basically, freedom blasters attached to the undead.  Nevermind, one necromancer too angry to die.
12:58 that's a statement hhaa!
Imagine if he did this challenge as the wood elves with Orion. Bro would have 50 armies by turn 5
This is WW0.5
That background music at the beginning has me feeling like a one man army walking to the grocery store to pick up dish soap. duh duhn duhn duhn dunna dunna dun duhn ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ )/
Viva pinyata is a core memory for me thanks for unlocking it!
Hi
Melwin and Doors, is this Yugioh Abridged 😂? Great video.
I wish I could like these more than once - every time I watch I still get the giggles!
Sorry, I can't play Warthunder I don't have access to classified Military documents
I just realized how much of the map I have memorized.
I here pvz music at 20:53
Ah yes, Skarbrand. Definitely the one to pay you instead of filling a sock with the coins and beating you to death with them
I think this is my third time watching this video, your delivery, gameplay, humor its all golden, you are without a doubt the best total war youtuber, I hope you make more videos of this game soon
That's not a problem, that's a feature
Fucking crazy how if you reach your thirty limit on traits it doesn't give you an option to remove one for another. I'd be pissed lmao
Best Warthunder ad ive seen
I love the intro 0:00
Do this but with lizardmen
“Let CHAOS take the world!”
alright man its time for another warhammer video.............. been a while...... Play Balthasar Gelt and re-enact the vietnam war fighting a vampire crisis
Geeze so much going on lol I can't keep up, awesome content
11:10 p e n n y c o x *button*
You sir, are a hero and an inspiration to all of piratekind.
Omg noctilus is coming Everyone be like  HODOR!
Allarielle the batshit insane
Every single time one of these videos come on, it really makes me want to turn my computer on and buy all the dlc 😢
"And a lot of humanitarian crying. At least there would be, if I thought elves were people" -_-
america fuck yea !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! o and also GUN
this video is fucking hilarious
MORE MORE MORE! I have never played any of the games, but it is so addicting to watch! Awesome stuff
Puss in Boots getting charged for his multiple accounts of genocide at the Nuremberg Trials 9:53
If you do more likr this id sub lol
can some one tell me what the music is at the start of this video that is like "dun dom dun dom dun dom clap clap clap clap"
The 'massive driver of GDP' line got me. thumbs up
Pls let Age of Sigmar never happen in the Total Warhammer franchise (the franchise of two other franchsies, official subtitle)
If I had a nickel for every time an undead pirate wielding a cursed sword became the most powerful person in existence and ruled the entire world, I’d have two nickels, which isn’t much but it’s weird that it happened twice.
You might have used a better tank example than the Bob Semple.
I have watched this video 5 times send help
15:36 beatbox champion ☠️ I dead
Queen Bess, her 4 baby Mortars, 4 Gunnery Wights and Necrofex Colossi was my Noctilus army in 2. literally didn't need to set foot inside any walled settlement. Right now, I'm digging the Norsca.
COME BROTH-oh yeah. FIRE GUN FIRE
When I played Immortal Empires the first time, and saw who got the Sword of Khaine, I thought back to this, and an overwhelming feeling of _dread_ filled me.  Especially 'cause I was at war with her...
This man's humor is absolutely 11/10, literally hilarious
I did this with 3 armies of 20 stack colossi in warhammer 2 but took a little bit of a slower approach 😅😂😂  I wish i could do it again in 3 but too broke to buy the remaining dlcs in 2 😂😂😂😢
Napoleon Roleplay
"A crushing defeat... But for who?"
Definitely got my Sub.  I'm dying laughing over here 😂
Noctilus thw Chaos God of Gunfire and Crabs, do not fear for noctilus is here when you're about to get smitten by a foe be relieved for the sounds of cannons and woe
I see you used empire total war tactics. Make them run at you and die in a volley of lead. Perfect!
6:38 brooooo 😂😅 nooooo im making a short clip of that statement....that is your promo...."FOR THE G.D.P"
I subscribed only because of the smooth war thunder plug.....stayed  for legendary content 😉
I honestly thought this was going to be a Lord only run
This is my first favorite legend lord. Not my favorite overall but the first one I fell in love with.
But like can we talk about how there arent sea battles
So either your title is click bait or you don't know what a one man army is and don't tell me it's impossible that would be a lie
Would love a vid on gobbos
No
"Man with crabs"  Hahahahahahahaha
Such a great video. Well done!
>zoom in on the German flag during the words "military atrocities" That joke was a greater source of national pride than anything my government did in the last few years.  It's good to always have something you can fall back on as a nation.
This pirate king did more damage to the high elves than Mslakith tried to do for the past thousands of years. Ironically it was all whilst he used the sword of the god the dark elves worship. Another thing: Imagine being Belathor...THE chaos champion of undivided power,gifted boons by all four gods,harnessing a legion of corrupted monsters and warriors,all for naught...All because a single pirate king walks in and claps your legion for daring to even get in his way.
What's that ending song?
34:01 what's that song?
Did you change the name of this video?
first time i heard someone make a cambodian joke and im all for it
War Thunder ❤
I don't even like total war style games but i can't stop watching this man's videos, great job man!
You may have created world peace via joint hatred. Nothing like a shared enemy to bring people together.
“It’s just like a business deal. Except there’s no business, no deal, and I have a gun”😂😂😂
Not gonna lie I want viva pinata remake
I can only imagine the amount of work that must go into productions like this. Well done man. I'm gonna stick around for more.
Can some one send this to old man reacts he does Warhammer videos and other things too
How tf this guy have so little subs. YouTube clearly glitching
You made me fucking snort so many times
Brilliant video 😁😁
This was amazing to watch! Thank you!
This was like an episode from a good TV show man! Liked and subscribed!!
How ironic that it was Belakor that stopped Noctilus from becoming a God. Must be jealosy...
Okay, but can we talk about how amazing of line "may God have mercy on you. This God." Is with the camera focused on Noctilus? Especially with the rest of the video backing it up?
Just saw a german gamestar article about this video and decided to rewatch it again xd
Total Warhammer 3, never heard of it. Heard ot Total War Warhammer 3 though.
Your vids are hiliarious, you deserve a subscription
22:02 I think the joke here was that they can’t speed in a school zone but I find it more funny if it was like one of those restraining order that says that’s person can’t enter a school zone
this keeps auto playing for me ive watched it like 12 times.
Natilus, too angry to die Malekith  always comes.
Where are the rats? Nuke goes off They are in the walls, THEY ARE IN THE GOD DAMN WALLS
That ending went hard good job man
28:13  I don't know why I find this so funny.
bro Noctilus literally pulled a lore accurate doom slayer what the hell
There Is black Magic and black powder
Pirate man scary
You know you've done it right when the auto resolve can't understand what you're doing.
I'm gonna kill you with the power of friendship - and this gun I found.
14:25 "sheer unwashed masses" My mind: "sheer unwashed asses"
that thumbnail goes hard
you remind me of ambigiousamphibean
the song at 4:40 is clapping, what is it?
this is so funny
Feels like the anti-spiffing brit and I for one am glad for representation and that we have both of them
Have you ever played a human
Bro , that dota 2 and Minecraft jokes killed me at the end
7:43
Hi 15:17
Better title could've been "total war but it's actually total war"
I don’t want peace only war
True pacifist
I absolutely love videos like this! I have rewatched this video 3 times in just a matter of days
Putting this on my watch later save because when I want a good laugh I am cumming here.
"that is a lot,... of naked green men" Absolutely sent me. 🤣
You and channels like yours make me want the game.....just not$80 want it.....maybe $30
Love viva piñata what a game
Loved this
*the sseth at home* meme at the and killed me, well played
Ima beat it so hard to the right side of 6:24
new here and i love your content. keep it up
My tactics in this would be to out pirate groves every port of ulthuan and norsca, then go to Araby to get naggashizar and the black pyramid and fortify the hell out of them to act as bait. Then chose one direction of the world that there's no pirate groves and start the world conquest
9:55 got me laughing so hard
YES! Finally the channel that puts songs used into description, WITH timecodes! Thank you so much for that!
0/10 not enough sea shanties
ahh yes his "known weakness with no known counter... DOORS"
Do you play dwarfs at all?
31:42 Man just witnessed an alternate universe
Hahah love the Humor
Dude..that that great was a lot of fun to watch keep it up
Mans turning a neck beardy game into a banger
E n t e r n t a i n m e n t
The quality of this video is absolutely wild! Easy sub, hope to see more warhammer in the future :D Best of luck
pirate🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🗡⚔️⛵️
pirate
Ahhh, yes, Tzeentch is a massive asshole
Why did the title of the video change?
this video has made me buy total war warhammer 3. having good time so war :)
misclicked..... arrived on this vid..... found the sarcasmn interesting and fun..... subbed
The fem boys joke at 6:50. Where, where do you get your humour from xD
Holllyy shit this was BALLER
I absolutely loathe ranged-players.... unless they use America as a back-story 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
part 2 when!!!! dun.dun.duuuuun
Ogres
Honestly I don't really watch Total war content creators, I just find it normally boring so I just play it, but this....... This was a bloody masterpiece
the siege segment at the end was amazing to watch
I have never seen a guy so good doing his video’s, the cut the humor the approach. It’s damn near perfect!
Those naked green man are naughty 😅
I hate blacks?!!!!!!!!
bless you sir for playing so many campaigns so we don't have to..... genuinely awesome video ^_^ PS I'd love to see you play as Wood Evles
10 minutes in first time seeing this game. My brain is in overload but im loving this for some reason
Incredible
bro knows how to make a promotion
This is the first video of yours I've seen, but holy shit was it a thing of beauty and wonder! Subscribed. Here for the lulz. Gibs moar plox!
Pvz 1 finds its way into all content and thats they way it should be
This sound.. It can't be! The rumbling! The rumbling is here! It's here!
That's awesome joke WE BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF THEM
25:07  Song?
I've seen this video like 5 times, such a Master piece
You're such a SETH spin off the way you talk :P
where did you find all the locations of the treasure?
I recentley got this game and if i was playing that way i would last to turn 2
Now do a reikland challenge
Vermintide hasn’t been newly added for awhile now
i wanted to play war thunder, too bad its not on steam
6:45 was not expecting a joke about femboys in a Warhammer video Xd
Make like the Russians and throw men at it.
Insane video, made my day.
That PvZ soundtrack hits me right in the feels.
"Even with our overwhelming number we are overwhelming incompetent"
No one: Grim Kleaper on his way to commit War crimes🍷🗿
What song plays at the end of the video 34:14 ? Shazam dint help. Also total war videos are amazing.
12:10 golden opportunity missed. Insert "Shoot her!" clip from Jurassic Park.
Such a great ending. Thanks, I watched every second.
Small hat
i see you have taken inspo from the frog man himself
The amount of memes is dangerous to health at this point, that's a sub.
I just threaten to make a military alliance with everyone. No one will want to be friends with you after that.
I wouldnt say free I would say under new management killed me
Rip politics in a total war video smh
you’re giving iamkibitz crossed with ambiguous amphibian. love the video !!
I did this we the empire, it sucked, including the instant civil war with elector counts and then i got pretty bodied by Grand Cathy of all NPC factions
Wood elves in the ocean is like forest Navi in ocean. HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT WORK!!!
Hey, thats Japan, at least be like kissenger and point somewhere in the jungle and say its vietnam
I like when pirates go boom (I have no clue what’s going on but it’s fun)
I don't usually do this, but this is the third time I'm watching this. It's just too good
Was it you in the costume?
The warhammer version of the rumbling.
23:08  this is the reason I love and hate tzeentch 😂😂
Kairos "JP Morgan" Fateweaver got me lmao.
We need your Warhammer playlist
more pls.
I have watched this video at least 5 times and will likely watch it again and again as its such nice back ground content as well. Editing style is hilarious and very entertaining.
Technically you didn't lose 6500 lives since they were dead to begin with.
Even though I keep finding myself playing this game time and time again, and having a lot of fun with it, I cannot stress just how much this game needs better optimization.
I think he forgot to declare war on his own faction
Just found this channel and game today. Subbed.
There ain't NO WAY I just saw someone make a viva pinata joke. Subbed
that was hilarious. thanks for existing
Imagining the work that goes into editing this makes me feel exhausted on your behalf, exceptional.
I honestly can't stand this type of edititing, it's unwatchable for me
nice
Literally at 0.1% of his power and still soloing an entire seige. Jesus christ
Now it time to do the opposite challenge, get thru a game without going to war with anyone (preferably with someone like Skarbrand).
That was the greatest and most compelling warthunder ad ive ever seen.
highly unexpected viva piñata reference based!
Behold algorithm  MY ENGAGEMENT
Should I be worried that I like internet historian, blue jey and I hit subscribe at the first video of this channel (this video)
Moar MoaR MOar MOAR
I laughed solo much with this video love it😂❤️✨
Does anyone know what mods grim uses if any
Great video
Man the Brigador soundtrack is dope
29:30 Risk of Rain crabs???
We just watched undead mech warriors go on a spree
Why did you use the BOB SEMPLE as an examplw for a TANK
I have never played a second of any Warhammer game. I didn't understand anything, but I liked the bright colors and the sound effects.
16:55 Missed oppportunity for image of the Rumbling. :)
FOR KHORNE
27:37 My favorite joke
Vermintide was added because of his Skaaven playthrough
what is the name of the song at the end? Sounds really good.
This was amazing. I laughed like six times. Keep it up!!
I guess you fight a lot of people's enemies before them.
Noctilus becoming a new Chaos God through overwhelming cannon fire and big crabs is truly the pinnacle of Warhammer lore.
Great video, surprised that YouTube algo got me here even though I don't watch Total war videos but i couldn't be happier
Great video. Your comentary made it so much better.  I don't play total war nor am versed in the warhammer universe... but this was great :)
ABANDON REASON KNOW ONLY WAR
Am I the only person who caught the "RoR crabs" comment?
pacifism from the peace god : ``shows skar``  there my guy is where i lost it lmfao
Idek what this game is
First ad that I wanted to watch....
What is that song at the end
"deceased rednecks" lol
17:00 its Warhammers version of the rumbling
This video in a nutshell: "I came here to kill elves and conquer the world, and I'm all out of elves."
I think I've watched this at least 3 times now  On a side note, what did those declarations look like? "I have waged war on you!" "Why?" "...I don't know. But we'll cross that bridge when we get there!"
best warhammer content ive ever seen :') subbed and liked
banger
I bet on....GUN
bro!  I keeled over when you zoomed on the German flag and said "committing war atrocities has never been more fun."
Do peasant only as brettonia
Hey you Mr Kleaper, I like your style
"Pulling an entire army out of my ass is surprisingly lubeless" love your way with words
On the topic of declaring war on everyone. Shouldn’t this have been the “Germany” campaign lol
That was very funny:) God bless your channel <3
Dwarves
so you did just a total war? and made a big deal of it?
Karl didnt actually do THAT much damage to you, he has magical attacks which means physical res does not get applied to the calculations
That viva pinata reference hit like a truck
this was beautiful
ngl the crab jokes got you a sub loved the vid
I'm somewhat of a William booty catcher myself 😌
"Luckily his decision to fly away was tactically poor" HAHAAHA
20:34 I don't believe you didn't notice that lol
This is just what Davey Jones would have done if Jack Sparrow didn't exist
When ever i see you play warhammer, it activates my dopamine receptors higher than The Count's ward save. Keep up the good work and make even more fantastic videos!
I just realised something: Immortal pirate Finds and uses cursed sword People come from all around the world to try and fuck him up That's Cervantes.
Please more warhammer 3
The Border Princes making it to the end has got to be the most messed up part of the entire campaign
i like bacause of viva pinta throwback
The joke at 3:30 was amazing
The last song sounds great what is it's title
never sub to most of these types of channels,  but you sir.... are comedic gold xD SUB +1
I didnt expect Adam Friedland to make a gaming channel
when was the vermintide endgame crisis added ? i dont have that
This gives me spiffing brit and martincitopants vibes and i love it! Subbed
Okay new theory: you’re not playing as the faction lord you choose, you’re playing as the sword of khaine that chooses the faction lord it wants to control
Shear unwashed masses of shear unwashed asses more like
I don't know why or how but I can't stop watching this video. It's just so fluid and well done I'm not tired it even watching it again
Sees title: *Happy Kohrn noises*
I have no idea what's going on in each battle but this video was entertaining as hell
your total war warhammer videos are the best
is this campaign with all the dlc's?
18th century warfare= "best" warfare
Huh. For a rather meme-y, mostly for hyuck's challenge run, I was not expecting to learn vocab on the term "Necromance" today.
why is it always gun :(
Judging by how many times I've watched these four Total Warhammer videos, I think it's safe to say I agree with many when I say please make more.
NIce ending lol
please make more
You are the spiffing american
The most sane total Warhammer player:
Easily the best ad spot i’ve ever seen. Inspiring me that WE CAN have fun with these reads!!
Are you related to Chris Hansen by any chance...
...you mean this isn't how you're supposed to play the game?
So, how long did all this take?
Why would you declare war on *EVERY* factions, my dude...??? 😳😱 As if declaring war on one isn't hard enough 😂
But you still used 3 talent points in lightning strike, when you could've used them on charge bonus...Simply a bad call.
I love the narration! So well integrated! Noctilus and the boiz tore it up baby
11:58  A Viva Piñata joke 😮! I loved that game!
who else googled ♀boys in cambodia haha great vid man
Bro, u're a genius!
Ахуеть Ебать ты конченный пиздец Но круто конечно спасибо
Good work Sseth.
23:04 I’m surprised the God of Fuckery only seemed to fuck you one time during the entire campaign.
you're the one who got me to buy TWW3 its my first game like this and ive already starting buy tons of dlc
William Booty Catcher
What was the song?
war thunder commertial.. my god
Please release more total war videos they are amazing
34:30 what's the name of this song? Smn knows? Edit: Nvm found it, it's "All hail the mighty*
"Beliveing i would not Shoot through my own units" My inner chaos dwarf *chuckles* 😈
Tzeentch is giant asshole made me laugh out loud :) Nothing was as annoying as every tzeentch faction spamming changing of the ways on you constantly before the patch.
I love this, despite you not uploading a lot, you have a better uploading schedule then Fitz.
Oh yeah guys, I tell you myself. Don't play war thunder. In fact, don't even touch it with a 5 meter pole. It's so bad it hurts.
u ought to make mo warhammer vids
This guy is definstly an economist
This group wields GUN their neutral special is GUN their ultimate is GUN their defense is GUN
0:00 Introduction 0:05 Premise 1:03 Rules 1:25 War Thunder Sponsorship 2:47 Act I: The Reckoning 17:40 Act II: Manifest Destiny
now this truly is TOTAL WAR warhammer.
"This sword makes everyone declare war on you." Normal players: "That's horrible." Kleaper: _"Oh my god automation yes please thank you."_
I don't play or know Total War Warhammer but these vids are making me add it to my Steam Wishlist to be bought during a sale and never touched
There's an Steam achievement for doing this in Troy: Total War (highly recommend btw, heavily underrated). I believe the actual achievement is declaring war on every faction the turn you encounter them. Less than a 0.2% achievement rate.
Gotta say, Be'lakor ruining your 90% ward save is exactly what he'd do. He was sort of an ally back on ulthuan, but decided letting you kill him was better than becoming a god. So it's only right you crush him as your last act.
Watching videos like this makes me wish I was actually good at the games like this and could make crazy shit like this
Xenos scum
duck voice
Did I hear GIA?
The amount of content showcased in this one video has shown me that this might just be the most variable and sandbox video game I’ve ever seen
Why do you use that kind of nonsense english what nobody understand?
Next video could be getting world peace with Skarbrand
Call that World Warhammer 3.
DWARFS!
For your next video, can you just turn everyone into your puppet state
This... this was beautiful
Next one you must capture the entire map!
Cool video but your analogies are trash son
Truly a Madlad
Be'lakor engages in some minor tomfoolery.
what the hell is total warhammer 3, I have no fucking clue what's going on. Is that bad? That's good? Why? How? Okay? What? But it's fun
War Thunder is a pile if garbage
Thumbs up for the beat the crab joke, it made me die of laughing (don't worry i was ressurected right after)
Whem khorne campaing?
No im not playing warthunder its 2am ill play it tomorrow i cant wait to get cucked in my mbt-70 by a ka-50
Karl Franz had magic attack. No physical resistance.
“Where committing war crimes” *zooms in on German flag* “has never been easier”
*anti-player biais intensifie*
0:21 national anthem starts playing in the background
Man I don't even play Warhammer and I love these vids
Honestly, founding father Count Noctilus von Washington busting down Belakor's door to manifest destiny his ass with the second amendment was such a perfect ending for this video! And the sea shanty? PERFECTION.
The time and effort you put into these is greatly appreciated.
Seriously, you need to do more of these, ive watch your 3 campaign videos like 30 times, i can definitely see you blowing up cause of these.
This is the most entertaining thing I've watched this year.
This was the video that inspired me to finally buy total war warhammer III and I'm loving it.  Currently attempting to save bretonnia from the skaven and wood elfs as Alberic de Bordeleaux alongside my brazillian lizard friends.
This is great you and try khorne or the dwarfs it would be interesting to see what you do with either of them
I thought I was watching Total Warhammer 3 gameplay. Not a depiction of hell.      Ork-related video when
IMO any the game is too easy if you dont have ultimate crises also if you set i t above 100 its also no challange
More total warhammer content is required
I almost died laughing at this im subbing and liking the video
THE GREAT CRAB MAN DEMANDS MURCH!!!!
Khorne would be pleased.
glad your getting enough support to go full time, keep doing what you like
“How does power beyond comprehension feel?”   Really makes me want to see a run Archaon booking it for Sok at the start of the game. Be pretty funny to watch the rampage
I keep giggle evrytime he nickname  one of AI leader "beatbox champion"
Only question i have is why does this guy sound like Owen Wilson?
The warhammer videos are so incredibly funny
I dont know what it is, but youre the ONLY channel ive ever gone to on purpose to rewatch videos ive seen before, no lie ive watched your skaven vid 6 times or more, the Taxevading tombkings 3 times and this is like my 4th or 5th time watching this one. What im tryna say is i dont quite know what it is, but YOU GOT IT!!!!  Btw, the unwashed masses of unwashed masses joke was so funny i spit out my water on my first watch.
Great video
thats not a problem its a feature 12:58
This was one of the best videos i've watched in a while, thank you very much
To be fair the crabs are taken straight from Japanese History.  Be sure the enemy doesn't knock the crabs on their back and attack their underbelly for massive damage!
I like at the end of a video it not "let Conquer the world with my unstoppable army" it "let destroy the person who irritated me the most with my unstoppable army."
Plants vs. Zombies
I want to see him do lizardmen… any lizardmen
"Look at this disgusting Empire smut!" 🤣
I got addicted to your vids chinaman next plese ;*
I haven't laughed that hard in ages
What the hell? This is great, subscribed
I dont even play total war, but these are hella interesting to watch. Entertaining too!
I don’t know why YouTube gave this to me but I’m not complaining
Create a Warrhunder armie in Warhammer! Tanks, Helis and more guns!
Just had to throw in your dumb little comment about Tucker Carlson, huh? He's a psycho?! Stick to what you're good at. Your view on politics is clearly infantile.
Our captain dude became the vampire version of the big bop
Bro why is every single TW:W3 video from this guy a fucking banger. This content is on repeat for me I absolutely love this dudes humor
“So how does power beyond comprehension feel?… ok” 😂😂
so im new to warhammer 3. how do you even set up a game to be like this?
Bloody awesome :D
Love the video I have never played or herd of Warhammer 3 but I enjoyed watching the video 10/10 would see again
Should have said inner Davy Jones instead of Jack sparow
Why have i never heard of u? Your amazing
Yay
I have watched this viedo 5 times and its still not enough
34:19
RIMWORLD pleeeaaasee
MORE
Me meanwhile picking skavens so I can make the world rat war 😂😂
I have never played this game, tho im always so invested in those videos, good job
Viva Pinata was fk awesome
by far the besr warhammer content
Pretty much an average this is Total War challenge..
Belakor is the epitome of "Slithering... Watch out. Watch out! *WATCH OUT!!!* B O O M!"
Of course the Skaven didn’t do shit
Why is your twitch empty my guy
14:24 My lungs still burn from laughter!
Am I the only one who saw the thumbnail with him in that pose with “world war” who immediately thought of “the major” from Hellsing abridged giving his war speech going “A true war! The sequel you all been waiting for! I! want! world war 3!!!”?
All im saying is that if i heard someone drinking my müller frijj i wouldnt let that shit slide
Just wanted to say thanks for the laughs and the geography lesson. 6:46 Cambodia is nowhere near Japan
The most entertaining video i have ever watch this morning
waiting for viva pinata video now
bro what man said about the skaven crisis had me on the floor cryin bro
Omg this must have been so much work! I love it pls keep this comedy up!
not sure if this remains true in 3, but in total warhammer 2 there was a cap on ward save and damage resistance.  Not sure what exactly the cap was, but I'm pretty sure noct had reached it by the time you fought Sigvald
is it just me or does the video seem to just stop buffering at certain points and then refuse to load unless i skip ahead?
6:45 as ur fan and Cambodia  I can’t comprehend this meant....
35 min of laughter!! I enjoyed every second of it!
Excellently made with a great rhythm. Nice story telling. I loved all the references. Truly, a great deal of efforts went into this. A well deserved like, good sir!
14:25 the unwashed masses is a great joke
I think I've watched this video like 5 or 6 times already
I remember in older TW games that, if you were playing on very hard, as soon as you bordered someone you were 99% guaranteed they'd declare war on you in the near future. No matter your relations and how many gifts you sent.
Love that PVZ music
"What's the Point of Building Giant Walls, While You are next to a Giant Hill"   I felt that.😆
Thx youtube for recommendation. Great gameplay and even better commentary. Easy subscribe
Doors...his worse enemy
Honestly didn't know this game, never were into total war games, AND EVEN THO I FREAKING LOVE THIS VIDEOS. Makes me curious about all the mechanics and factions of the game. Awesome videos!
Please keep making these i love them
I find you hilarious, I loved this, I now love you and I hope to god you make more of these. Much love! Hope you see this too cause seriously I actually loved this, aight bye!!
my guy you are way to good at scripted vids. This shit slaps continue your work, But also invest into a patreon cause this shit deserves more support.
this is great
femboys in Cambodia
bro i subscribed cause i laughed so much
Dude your Videos are insane, now your doing fulltime there will be even more great things to come
After coming back and watching this for who knows what time, it was this video that finally made me subscribe to your channel. I've sadly never played Total warhammer games but they seem fun and if done right, pure chaos. Idk if you'll see this comment Grim Kleaper but I just wanted you to know your content is amazing and I'm looking forward to seeing more of it, and of course watching your older videos whilst I await new uploads
i have never even played the game yet this video was one of the most entertaining things ive watched in a bit
This guy is making my loyalty to Legend of Total War and Cody Bonds shaky. He's so funny and actually quite good.
i have absolutely no clue what this game is or what was going on but i certainly enjoyed it
i can see the inspiration from martincitopants (i think, he couldve copied it from someone else or you) but great video none the less
You should do the dwarfs next they have a unit similar to the death wind mortars the skaven use called the dreadquake mortar and it can get ridiculously stupid
My biggest question is, why is Brigador music the new goto royalty free choice?
6:45 bro this is the map of south america
Yo that viva piñata reference made my day, nostalgic as hell for that game
This just came up randomly and I am so glad I decided to watch this its freaking gold love your humour you sir have gained a new sub
Now do a pacificist run by making peace with everyone but getting the short victory campaign
I like to think that kleeper got dressed for the little bit he did for like two seconds and then undressed right afterwards
certified grim kleaper classic, i have already rewatched it 4 times
William Booty Catcher will be the name of my first-born son.
We need a playthrough where every faction is at war with every other faction, though I have no idea how that would work. I just want true TOTAL WAR!
Do this on legendary and I'll be impressed.😂
I’ve never even played a warhammer game, let alone a territory based war game. But this is still very, very cool and entertaining. Congrats you made a game that probably requires a lot of brain power dumb enough for even me to consume.
that wart hunder ad made me sub. bro i laughed so hard
Not going to lie, but that’s the first time i didn’t skip a “war of thunder” Sponsored ad and now I low key might download it due to your commentary!!
This was amazing, subscribed
Please do an Empire run. The suffering would be amazing.
that clap sync at the start got me hooked lol
First video I’ve ever watched of yours and I gotta say I loved it 😂
Artist of the Femboy art is: sky_guy_art  Enjoy.
"Best way to play the game"( laughing maniacally)
Are you going to play the new age of wonder 4 game?
10:19 is the perfect incapsulation of the warhammer experiance
this guy is like oversimplified uploads once in a while but the videos are top quality
we need a chaos dwarf video
This is a game of all time
more! MORE!!!!
34:01 showed me the proper way to end a campaign.
Why Belakor must ruin everything XD, ruined Cadia's fall, ruined Vashtor seek of power and now ruins this video  :( Btw very good video dude
jack sparrow got super jacked
Bro played as Tau
"May God have mercy. This God."  Is so badass I'm gonna start using it
I love this man
My guy made the rumbling army with guns
6:45 that is not Cambodia
Please make a viva pinata video. Thank you.
I absolutely love this so much!
man the war thunder ad got me 💀💀
my fav part was where he said "Its warhammering time" and warhammered all over the place
holy shit, new watcher, and immediately subscribed. fucking love this. just found you today, showed up in my feed. the algorithm is in your favor!
Great video love the jokes !!!
Bro how tf does he find ways to break warhammer 3 THIS BADLY
Am I imagining things, or is the music around 7:15 the Zerg music from Starcraft?  Edit: The Starcraft Terran music also plays at 27:41!
man this is so coool!!!! my dream of making the whole world an enemy
As a person from the USA this really should have just named the USA playthrough
I hope you make another Warhammer video but I'd like to see you try the Chaos Undivided faction. Id like to see whats monstrosity you make for the customizable Daemon Prince
Brood war sound track uh
since when you are called kleaper
34:25 DOOM ETERNAL in a nutshell
Actually funny how by being at war with everyone, they can bring the money to you. Saves you the trip
31:45 did he say dwarven Slovenia?
You're either fighting multiple 20 stacks or 1 homeless guy 😂😂😂
Make more videos like this
Just about had a stroke with Khatep playing Gangnam Style, I was not expecting it in the slightest and it broke me.
never had the wits or attention span to play these kinds of games, tried so hard to like shogun but was so trash at it, pissed me off for the last time so i'll watch from now on
mfw you literally had a total war
How would sigvalds defet trait mske him invincible becuse all it does is give him 10% pychical resitanc
"We have the SHEER unwashed masses of... *takes a moment to process* ...SHEER unwashed masses"
i have never even heard about this game before but this video still intregues me.
no idea who u r but i respect the pvz music
Please do more
Heck yeah great video my dude!!
Hmmm this guy funny *follows*
love your dedication bro
the Brigador ost makes it even more memeworthy.
I love these vids😂
"I don't want peace... I WANT PROBLEMS. Always" personified
"however, biggr swoard"  i dont even play warhammer and this strat makes perfect sense to me
You know you’re gay when you get excited because the YouTuber used art from you’re favourite femboy artist
This was very entertaining despite the fact you're not the best at combat!
I have never seen this channel in my life but holy shit this video was so good! I will be subscribing and recomending to my friends!
You voice and your editing are just perfect
Bro why was this shit so funny 😂
its not a problem its a feature i hear Mojang say that all the time
dude you actually make me wanna play warhammer and also what a great video
Gun isn't a spell though, that's Lead (Sling(er/ing)/Shot/Volley). Guns are merely Wands and Staves with the spells bound to them.
Bro, the idea of two powerful violent fuelled monsters.. a vampiric pirate and its army of the undead, and a blood thirsty daemon, both of them tearing away, from faction to faction, destroying all in their path and meeting in the middle of nowhere to settle who is the strongest... only for the victor to look on at their victory before sinking into the ocean. Is so fuckin metal
i love this absolute chad of a player ;)
How did I just discover this channel, DO MORE PLZ
do dwarfs next
Meanwhile I have the difficulty on normal and i can't even complete 1 campaign (excluding the Prologue)
First time in decades that my short attention span brain damaged by shorts , have ever been captivated by a 30min+ vid , luv ur work!
"either multiple 20 stacks or a homeless guy". bro that got me choking on my water. perfect that it was an ogre too
This is spicy
wait are you not suppose to get a new recruit like... 60 turns in or somethign
men, i just watched the video out of curiosity but discovered gold in the end, i laughed more than i should kek
Please make morw of these stuff!! I'm addicted to this!!
So a corpse wielding gun is good?
You and spiffing Brit would be the best duo
I wish i had the same level of calmness...yaknow imagine ur head being targeted by anyone and ur still peacefully talking
Idea: Rimworld but with every gene lol
Subscribed for the Viva Piñata reference. Stayed for the sheer deafening firepower of a million guns.
I’ve never seen this game before and I’m so confused but it’s entertaining
So a Khorne player tried to play a different faction without changing tactics?
And the grimoire of GUN is the 2nd amendment
Truly amazing content sir you are a true comedian❤
And I don’t thought 40K and AOS had a lot of factions
Kleaper: we May be at war with every single person in the world except our people. But we have one saving grace and its this thing called the second ammendment. Sure the founding fathers said home defense and its a country so its more or like homeland defense.  Also loved the rats video you did on this and the androids video in the other game (i forgor the name)
"Gun."
says cambodia, shows picture of japan,
“May God have mercy on your soul… this god” went hard af
I have no idea why they would sponsor you, but sure thing.
How long took the last battle with only Nocticulus? O_o
Awesome video! Perhaps, zombies only Helman Ghorst or World Peace, Pacifist Tyrion?
I have literally never play Warhammer and never play on playing it. But every time you upload a Warhammer video, I watch it. It's just the amazing story telling that encapsulates me ig.
Lol Tucker isn't a psychopath
This guy gets more entertaining each vid
Count noc is the best lord in the whole game
no idea how this game works or about anything in this video but havent seen something this entertaining in a while
This is alot.... of naked green men....  If i had a penny everytime i heard this....
The Grim Kleaper teaches us delayed gratification and quality is better than quantity
Mid game just became March of the ents, but if they had cannons.
be'lakor is a good band
I would love to see this with Skarbrand
k
I don't even play Warhammer (outside of 40K) but your videos are absolutely hilarious man. Good shit.
The three commandments of playing war thunder: 1. Play war thunder 2. Kill your enemies 3. Leak official government documents.
legend of total war is gonna jaw drop
The videos are always more than worth the wait
Damn, those TWH3 Videso are awesome. We NEED more of them! But it seems like they take forever to make, thats sadge :(
17:52 crew-sade
Doing Math  "...Meaning it's more expensive to upgrade these-than THIS!"  That really got me while working in a library
hello grim I have bought Rimworld only beause you made it soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much fun
The grim kleaper has blown up. Love it.
Full time time let's F*cking gooooooooooo
Sick vid
what a shitty 4ss game
Vampirates are stupid OP. You get all the economic benefits of having settlements All the mobility benefits of being horde, or rather having black ark that can walk on land. And you are god damn necromancers who cancompletly replenish thier whole army after battle the bigger loses the better units you get. AND you get absurdly tough missle infantry from day 1
"the age old art form of minimum wage" - I'm in tears. You make this game so entertaining.
can you please make more of these videos these are my favorite
do more tf2 pls
That penny cox was good one, i wish i could know game better lol when i play empires i get smashed on ez i cant imagine play it like that or on hardest ☹️ i dont know its complex
The commenting on this video is indescribably amazing.
The 2nd amendment will always when
I think your content very well may be my entry point into this game. All of this bullshit looks so fun 😂
viva pinata reference, yep your amazing Kleaper
Man I really want to playbthis game  But to enjoy the sheer varioty and choas in these video id need the dlcs Which collectivly with the game coast over $400 (at least in my country)
Red.....
plz make more videos on this game its really funny and good quality video
How money did you paid for this game+all dls you have?
YOU DID NOT JUST DO A VIVA PINATA REFERENCE…  MY MAAANNNN
holy shit this must have taken ages. Wait what took longer? the actual campaign or editing the video? hahaha
Sometime in the future if you decide to try different lords with factions you've already played can we get a clan moulder Skaven video ?
I have to commend you. This is the first time I have ever wanted to play a game because of a sponsored ad in a YouTube video.
Me: Can we watch SsethTzeentach? Mom: We have SsethTzeentach at home SsethTzeentach at home:
Bro, iv bin looking for viva pinjata for years. never remembering the name of the game, thanks!
So this is how the greyjoys hope all their rebellions go
Less goooo
I await the day we have another skaven video
this dwarf ass got me.
What was that Sea shanty towards the end?
[|87
I love this video, but i have one critic. You should have played the best faction. WAAAGH!
Bro, I’m actually doing the same thing 😂😂
woah dude just stumbled upon your channel! nice to see you again
Amazing work man
Hard no commerce is hard
Eu jogando de caos com a espada khaine, esse deve deve ser o nome ? No modo lendário passa 40 turnos todas as facções do jogo estão em guerra comigo , se vice não tiver abilidade de ataque relâmpago você está ferrado.
This fits too well with the insane undead pirates. Nothing can stand against the power that is the Lore of Sulfur, or Gun Magic to casuals.
Alternative title,  Role-playing as Britain
Holy moly, this guy has the masochism of DoshDoshington with the entertainment vibe of Martincitopants. I like it ^^
10:14
Saying “tank” and the showing a picture of a Bob Semple is just master class memery
War hammer doesn’t have guns
Interesting how different tge overall experience is, when ever i play immoral empire the dark elves always wipe the high elves out before turn 50 XD
Next is chaos dwarfs ?
WICKED
Try to play for Vietnam in the future, or as it is known here - wood elves. They have a couple of cute sisters with bipolar disorder, where you can play diplomacy and get alliances from almost everyone who is not Orcs and Skavens, or skip the "Cold" war stage and fight on 5-8 fronts at once. At different points on the map. Without the ability to build adequate settlements.
Jeez. I did miss that kind of stuff. Great job once again. :)
By far the funniest gameclip I have seen ... amazing 😄
You see the thing is, that i've never played this game. Video is fun tho
Bro, how many weeks have you been playing this?
Will there be another video of this epic adventure
Cool game
This really was a total war hammer 3.
vilitch the curseling.
can we talk about the absolute flex destroying a faction with a single man is
"Tornado in a jar" killed me.
It feels like real Overlord where they tried to concour the entire world 🌎
i like your videos nice
Lowkey the sea shanties are the best of the faction
6:46 That is not Cambodia that is England
Undead Pirate Eren Yaeger cosplay went well it seems
Has nobody mentioned that this video is literally just AoT:The rumbling.exe this entire episode?
BOAT
This dollarstore TseethZeentach or whatever the hell that guy's name is editing style hurts my eyes. All the constant zooms and pans make me feel like I'm having a stroke. I can't even think or look around when watching your videos - you shove whatever you're talking about right in my face for half a second. I am willing to bet a ridiculous amount of money that the majority of commenters on this video can't summarize it, which settlements you took first, which factions lasted longest, hell, even the best jokes or what they were about, everything's so fast, rambly and listless. I know this was scripted, but was it even structured? How, as a viewer, do you comprehend any of it? Its just in one ear out the other. I watched this whole video but don't remember anything about it aside from your boring OP doomstack ranged-heavy armies as the Pirate Coast, the editing being annoying, and some ability where you killed two armies before you even got to the battlefield except for one unit and then mollywhopped the single unit. That was pretty early in the game too, so you know the rest of this wasn't gonna be hard.  This cookiecutter hyperspeed TikTok editing style of 'gaming challenges that are drawn out for too long and made to feel like it was actually difficult even though the whole thing was easy' are absolutely everywhere. The entire recommendations bar is filled with gaming nerds with the same personality doing this exact same type of video. The same type of thumbnail, the same type of narration with milquetoast humor and pointless sex jokes, same spastic editing, same titles that are more buzzwords, capital letters and hot topics than anything else. Same boring challenges that sound interesting and dificult but actually aren't hard. Especially since most of them use speedrunner level exploits, glitches, or just cheese game mechanics to oblivion to be able to accomplish more easily whatever pointless challenge they're doing.   I'm too old for Youtube anymore.
Did you just call me a Dark Elf?
Noculus is the Ikit of the Vampire Coast.
iloveu i tried to sub but alr was
trait limit is actually 40 but it adds traits the moment you start making progress to them, meaning you had 10 inactive traits. you were just lucky to get a nice even number. Look it up for a mod that fixes it
Subscribed
Grim rejects feeble concepts like the geneva convention.
Let's FUCKING go, Kleaper. Started watching you around the time you uploaded that Rimworld zombie mod video, and boy am I happy to see how much you've grown in both presentation and script writing. I guarantee you that your just gonna keep growing if you keep going. This video is no exception, I've never touched a Total Warhammer game and yet I was entertained the entire way through.
Finally he's done it he has really made a total war
I watch total war videos, but i have no idea what the fuck is going on 60% of the time. And this is no different, still enjoyed it.
20 minutes in... haven't stopped laughing yet XD
8,950!!!! LMAO ok ok that got my subscription I don't know any of the games on your channel but you are FUNNY! Love the energy! Wish my PC could run Warhammer
Easily the best content I've seen in a while
Warhammer Vids are my favorite now Grim start a WWWWAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
Did you do this on legendary difficulty? If not, that should be Rule #3.  With pretty much the same rules as #1 and #2, I have done this campaign successfully from The Awakening as Markus Wulfhart. It was pretty damn hard in WH2 with the HE due to being surrounded by everyone and they just land everywhere on Ulthuan.  Markus Wulfhart melts faces if you can make it to  Tier 5 cannon technology. It was one of my funnest-ever campaigns, and I did it in WH3.
I just watched this 4 times
Yws
Funny, was my first faction. Love your Warhammer vids and you played my fav faction! Great stuff
This series gives me life
Can you do lizards next?
At last TRUE TOTAL WAR!!!
Do you think any other faction could survive this challenge
You make the best warhammer vids I’m happy you finally realized it
I feel like you would get along really well with Martincitopants
I dont know how I got here. I dont even play warhammer 3...or any other total war titels, but you catched me in the first few minutes. Im super entertained even tho i dont know what is going on. have my sub.
This video is a work of art.
I love kleeper Warhammer
11:58 I miss viva pinata
More
Never played warhammer never even watched a video about it, but this video was so well made and interesting you got me interested.
This is the Warhammer game of all time
Pov a American men in the 1800s
bro you fought armies with fucking titans jesus fuck
Full-time GK? Awesome
That bug with controlling ai army +large armies should probably get fixed
never played this game beofre
Wow...2nd time, finally checked the number... wtf @9:58
I didn't think you'd get half as far as you did
Yeah vampire coast endgame stack is necrofex. Bonus to upkeep cost makes them winner by default, rotting leviathan are more for big monster stomp
What's the specs of your computer just curious
“Committing military atrocities”  *zooms in on German flag*
Kleaper, you do not know the most powerful hero yet, try out Vengence Incarnate, Dwarf Belegar Ironhammer, he don't give a fuck even if he kills whole armies by himself, just give him a tankard to drink from XD
I don't understand this game, nor do I understand what this guy says half the time but god dammit am I going to watch it
When the Vampire Coast lots of money
British be like: Time to colonize all of these uncivilized barbarians with MUSKETS"
A masterpiece
Mmm pirates
So its just a normal playthrough as any evil faction, huh
Glorious amount of guns, just as the founding fathers intended
get a friend who has never played Warhammer 3 before and guide him through his first campaign letting him do dumbass decisions
Congrats on getting full time! Love the Warhammer vids!
Yeah grim kleaper
this video was a masterpiece from start to finish
И на какой сложности он играет?
I ain't no booty catcher
Me a legend fan: 'A' a fellow This is total war appreciator.
background synthwave hitting hard actually
Thanks for cambodia reference
That’s hella insane lmao
I see you playing the roll of sasuke
This is the ideal Warhammer playthrough. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
Dude this is a awesome video u earned my sub for sure!
Cosplaying as Germany in another plane of existence
Pretty cool to see someone I watch regularly have a character in this game, in this video. BurkeBlack.
I remember killing god with a musket it was fun
Loved everything about this video!
Ya know, your editing style reminds me over a certain african warlord  and for that you have my thanks.                                 hey hey people
holy crap, i remember watching your rimworld videos back when you had like 4k subs (or 14k idk) and just look at how far you've come, i'm proud of you dude
Yes, true to real life US. Clearly warhammer 3 is the most historical of all total war games.
this video is the deffinition of warcrimes
As my favorite git once said: WAAAAAAAAGGHHHHH
not enough skavens, dislike
Please do Empire next :)
So I put this video as background noise while playing Total War. Apparently I ended watching the entire thing while only playing 2 turns.
I haven't watched the whole vid yet, but Creative Assembly's Total War games, even back during the good 'ol days in the 2000s, have always had bad diplomacy that was absolutely worthless.  It was guaranteed even allies that you went out of your way to support, will eventually try to backstab you.  Even if it means they'll be quickly be annihilated by you.  So knock yourself out and never be setup by a false sense of finding friends in a Total War game.  They'll turn on you eventually anyways.  Give them hell.
I just got into a warhammer and  found your  videos. I've never been more into a game. It was so fun to play, and I'm excited to see what comes of your videos. Hope to see you around more.
That was a neat video!  Now drop the unedited footage.
the viva pinata part brought me back fire ass games i wish they had a remaster
THAT'S A LOT OF GUNPOWDER!
:pepe_pray: thank you lord for having this man of a man release another Total War 3 video.
average skaven playthrough
average skaven playthrough
FULL TIME??? Also the fact this video is 35 min long is fucking crazy. It was amazing, i really like your editing and adding the sea shanty at the end? Chefs kiss
Hope we get loads more war crime videos dude!
what mods are you using
He protecc He attacc But most importantly Warhammer is bacc
World war 3? More like world war me
Good comedy thanks great vid
As a German i appreciate and approve the zoom in on the German flag while talking about committing military atrocitys. Watched the Ad 2 times. Other than that great Video as always keep up the Geneva convention ignoring beauties id call art, if i may.            Lets see how many people think im a na*i or some shit like this because of these jokes building up on jokes in the Video lol
Instant subscribe. You've got style, my man. However, every time I see that mask....  *bell tolling* ... "Bring out your dead" lol
Chaos Dwarfs next ya flog
13:52 that cut tho 💀
Seeing that Sun Dragon get humiliated like that at 14:07 just made my day as a Morathi main. 😂💀
The best channel with another masterpiece again
Looking forward to seeing the industrial revolution of the chorfs
You give off a hint off Sseth Tzeentach, and i love it.
This man never misses with his total war videos!
nice
the intro of this video was glorious, here sir have a subscription!
Can you play Chaos please?
really nice sense of humour. Looking forward to more videos.
Noctilus is a pirate No loyalty does he possess
Vermintide, more like Spermintide.          I'll head out buying some yummy tide pods now, cya <3 8===D O:  -> 8==0:   -> 80:
In Malekith's defence...
this is the 3rd time i’ve watched this video
This one earned my Subscription
ngl the editing is kind of cringey
Happy to see a new warcr- err upload
Hail the mighty Noctulus Von Washington
so happy to see you go full-time, i absolutely adore your content and i cant wait to watch you grow
It was funny and made me laugh. Thank you
32:50 there is something so fitting about the pettiest Deamon, Be’lakor costing you the ultimate build 🤣
If u play it again should use the dinosaur guy
Love all your vids!
if you playing tww3 - how on a fkin earth you have time to play anything else, ESPECIALY warthunder? XD
Bit of Nostalgia but damn cant believe you referenced that Pinãta game. Played that shit alot back in the day lol
20 necronfex Doomstack, aka: RUMBLING! RUMBLING!!!
what broke me was the “They might be heavily armed but we are more heavily legged” around the 26m mark
Y’know, I just wanted to leave this comment here to tell you that I absolutely adore your videos. Your humor and editing makes me laugh like very few other things can. Thank you, Grim Kleaper, for these hilarious videos.
i dont think people understand just how hard to create, play, edit a campaign like this and compress it in a funny 20 min video. Absolute massive props, subbed and liked
I love your videos, it’s so amazing that you have gone full time with YouTube ❤
World War? Nah bro, that's just annihilation
So, the tactics here is line infantry. It actually works
Bro your total war warhammer videos are the best I’ve seen in a long time, and I hope you the best
Bro definitely committed some war crimes
You should have called crab man Mr crabbs
I Love your total war videos
Was not expecting the Viva Pinata reference xd. I love that game
You : Alerian vs the guy she tells you not to worry about : Banana chin man with big stick
True power of the industry
15:03 i was afraid he was going to federal reserve
I love these videos, pls keep making them, maybe next time u run as the dwarfs
Superb stuff, your comedic timing is on point.
When your war bar looks like a barcode💀
Youtube algorithm recommended me something good for once. Idk who you are, but I'll be looking forward to more Total War content from you.
love ur vids bro, keep  up the good work
I hope they make a total war: warhammer 40k one day
"The strongest spell ever invented: [GUN]" Somewhere in the 40k universe Gork and Mork pause from their constant brawling in the Warp to nod sagely in agreement with this statement. For dakka is, and always will be, the strongest spell ever invented. (and if it's not enough: 'add moar dakka')
Part 2?
You should try chaos dwarfs next please
Editing is top notch 👌
MORE CRABS.
why the fuck I watched this video 3 times in a span of two days? what the hell is wrong with me and why youtube always recomends me stuff I already watched?
These videos make me realise how bad I suck at this game 😂😂
Every single person in the Warhammer franchise.'ëxists.'' Grim Kleaper: '"I see you have chosen death
When your a demon god and you expect a dead pirate to die to your army but the pirate didnt die but the pirate committed genocide on your demons
very internet historian-like
my brain:is it worth it waiting for so long me:YES
Is there no mod for removing trait cap?
Yay!! more kleaper vids
Count Noctilus became one of my favorite campaigns because of 2 things, he is basically a horde army so I can go where I want and do what I want and secondly, those Colossi are amazing
alright, cool, you sponsored war thunder... *now play the game*
Bro, I haven't thought of Viva Pinata in YEARS!
Yessss. The absolute best videos for WH 3 by you! Thank you!
I love your use of speedrunners music, that game doesn't get enough credit.
*"Can't expect God to do all the work"* and Grim Kleaper proceed to wipe every factions in TW3 until only one is left This is not cringe. This is KEK xD
You just know this man has been binging legend of total war videos.
This is fantastic, Glad I found you! Will be sharing you with my friends!
FINAAAALLLYYY THATS WHAT WEVE BEEN WAITING FORRR.   No cap though i watched all your warhammer videos, and then looked at the last upload and saw a few months and about cried 😭😭😭 these videos are fire. Your rimworld vids are also pretty good but i tend to like videos on games i havent been utterly addicted to for months on end more anyways
Great vid, very entertaining and enjoyable
Waiting on Jeff Bezos the chaos dwarf work boss
Noctilus on his way to be an actual God and still have crushing defeat auto-resolves
If not for Bela'kor  is an ongoing trend this days
Man, play Khorne pls!
Love this video YouTube didn’t recommended it to me 😢
I have no idea what this game is, or how it works, but these videos are fantastic.
Ok but Belakor coming in out of nowhere to screw you out of attaining godhood in the form taking the final trait is not only hilarious, its also kinda lore accurate.
100 pons rimworld when?
You are making a step in the right direction, dope ass video. Subscribed
God tier video.
Really good add insert 😂
I love your Warhammer videos so so so so much
That sponsor bit was absolutely phenomenal
I was thinking about doing something like this a few days ago, your video timing is perfect! Now I can see if it'll be fun or not
Full time grim kleaper!  Glad you can make more content now!
I knew it
Where is Spiff?
6:34. Enemy of my enemy.  Also if there's enough inaction in a war it'll mend relations.
Taking total war literally
Vampire counts are by far my favorite faction to play
- The sad thing is, as informative and engaging as it was…all I kept thinking about while watching the 2nd half was how I wish the Monstrous Arcanum was available to all factions. It would be funny to see the Necrofex Armada up against all those Monster Hunts and what clashes of titans those would all turn into - 25:12 I'm so jealous that you spawned Celestial Storm...I still haven't personally seen them yet
I have never seen your videos and i quite enjoyed the commentary. Keep it up
I’m glad he compared a pirate cove to Femboys in Cambodia
Crabo
The return of the king Anyways love the vids bro 😂
<3
I don’t Know Who This Guy Is…   But He’s Kinda Hot
I love your total war videos. Please do more
Orks would of made sense lore wise
One of the best TWW Vids, I love it, you, guns and the sword of khaine ❤
Ah total warhammer 3 the most unfinished game in existence, still somehow being funny af to watch people cheese on
15:00 👌👌🤞🤞 Respect!
Normal skeleton interaction
Pls more total war vids
Hey! Thats My doomstack!
1:28 Promotion Skip Button: 2:19
16:23 is that the fucking rumbling
Legendoftotalwar says git gud
The grind for this video is insane
Don't feel you have to be shoehorned into TWH3.  I love your work, and it seems to be the most successful, but you're cultivating an audience that will allow you to branch out a bit.   I for one would love a Crusader Kings video, for example.   Keep up the good work my dude
Youre on trending dude, thats craaazy, hell yeah!
Amazing last battle.
Congrats on going full time and the sponsor, looking forward to more vids
Pvz music in the background
Hilarious. Fantastic. This video was great
Very good content. Thanks for the entertainment!
Please keep doing this.
You should do khorne or seraphon
Thank you for the video.
Badass
I’ll try a campine like this next
Can someone tell me in a bit more detail how he made count noctalius so unkillable, I want to recreate the pirate god that was in this video
I guess this bring a peaceful AI in many place on the map, as everyone greet eachother for fighting with you.  Wolrd peace achieved !
I dont like your new fast action edit style. I liked the old series type of edit. Slow but funny edits with different parts. But the people of today like fast action edits so I think im quite alone. Nice video anyways. By far the best total war channel. Keep it up
Love it ❤😂😂😂😂
"Every campaign I play, [...] Tzeentch is a massive asshole"  Yep, sounds about right for the Fucker of Ways
What's wrong with a warm pillow!?
Holy shit that Ai control shenigang is something I didn't know about. Does that work since Warhammer 1 and in other Total War games as well ?
FOR THE ALGORITHM
when your voice cracks you sound like the space core from portal 2
Which mod was used to reveal all factions? Wanna try this with Morathi
Fun stuff and good to see War Thunder as a sponsor.
More warhammer please
Now this is the real war thunder 😂😂😂
Pls don't stop your videos are so funny
Those boats are basicaly Metal Gears, aren't they?
Great video.  Very Entertaining!   I find it infinitely funny that not even you with a God Army will go for the Domination Victory.  Has anyone ever took the time to do that?!
Do a pacifiste challenge
Back to watch for a second time.
Dota 2!?
Ah wonderful, another crackhead YouTuber with the same amount of mental illnesses that I have. Truly my favorite kinds of content creators, you have my subscription.
While I am not a Warhammer lore expert;  The Skaven spanning in with a world ending army made up of millions of rats just to take over bump fuck nowhere and gangbang a single dwarf, while Ikit runs off to build a nuke seems perfectly in character.
I love this!!! More warhammer!
I dunno why but I legit died when nocs tuffets opponent was door
*Do You want a Total War* Then this is what Goebbels had in mind
>undead rednecks with floating trailers I hope they add ships in Rimworld's next Expo so I can play Redneck pirates...
Best vid
Watching kleaper get his warthunder sponsor is like watching a baby take their first steps, so proud 😩
More! Moreeee! MOREEEEEEEEEEE!
you almost made me install warthunder again :D love the ad
Top tier content 🎉 Gotta love it when grimkleeper uploads
Wow
34:54 würde ich anschauen no joke
You sir earned my subscription
Perfection, great video. You couldn't lose.
When I heard the pvz song in the bg sound. I know I have to see this.
The only total war videos I watch, great stuff man.
Honestly every time I see Grim come out with a total warhammer video i keep hitting myself since i have still not gotten it. I still have nightmares about the schizophrenic necromancers from the last one with the shaggy and scooby voices talking about unarmed civilians.
Heheheha
Truly a total war
love your total war hammer videos!
Really like your comments on video, so fun
I really appreciate it  . . . but not as much as dude who posted answers to them
11:33 I did a spit take IT HAS NO RIGHT BEING THAT FUNNY
we beat the crab out of em~ hmm...
im so glad this guy is going full time, looking forward to more bangers
Geez I never imagined that holding the Sword of Khaine for that long would basically make anyone a god
I feel that you unknowingly created soul caliber lore and I find that great.
love your videos
I havent played Total War Warhammer even once, I also have little interest to do so (its Just not my cup of tea), but Boy howdy, do I LOVE these videos!
what the fuck did i just witness- that was unholy lmfao
SO glad the algorithm shoved this onto my timeline. This was a great watch, you've earned a sub from me.
mad respect for using the FTL: Multiverse soundtrack
Commenting for the algorithm
best total war content creator
Come on I can't be the only troll in here 😂
CLICKTHELINK
*Video about zombie faction* *Has Plants Vs Zombies music in the background*  You sneaky bastard im in
No way he is going full time. Can't wait for more banger content.
FINALLY!! I VE WAITED TO LONG FOR THIS VIDEO.
4:56 Bad choice: the picarron's hideout gave you just 56 gold per turn, while the Smuggler's cove gives you a fixed amount of money, 200 in WH2. So for the hideout to be worthwhile the settlement must at least generate an income of 402. Hope you found out by yourself during your campaign. Anyway if a cove income is below 600 it is more worthwhile to build the building to increase the capacity for mournghouls hunters and gunnery wights if you can afford them.  3:10 Poor necrarch vampires that invented and crafted the monster... 16:30 a vampire captain with lore of vampires in Noctilus army would have been most beneficial: it summons zombies to keep the enemies away from your colossi, a decisive corwd control unit. Plus wind of death and arcane conduit.  Beatbox Khatep ahahah well done
I know its a huge time Investment but i would love to see a total world domination video.
Love your videos :DD
Yes the  keeper has uploaded another warhammer 3 video praise the reaper
This video is a masterpiece
"We are either fighting several 20 stacks, or a homeless guy", is the most accurate representation of Warhammer AI I have ever heard,
You’re incredible man 😂 your video make me laugh beyond my capacity and i love it 😂❤❤
I wonder if Grim will play as Chaos Dwarfs?
damm 4 20 stacks he probably smoked them.
Ive watched this 3 times from start to end, you're videos are god tier Mr Grim Kleaper.
i think its time for dinosaurs my friend.
Finallyyyyyy a kleaper video
This series serves better as an advert than any other sponsor some executive can come up with
"Taking over....this dwarfs ass"  that made me laugh out loud and gained you a subscriber
Amazing
So I really want to get this game, or even just start playing TW Warhammer 2, but do I need the dlcs to get the full experience or are the dlcs just fun new armies to use or whatever
You have become my favorite youtuber. Your videos are pure gold. Continue with this amazing content you do because it's freaking awesome!
what is the song at 34:27 ?
we need more TW warhammer 3 videos
discount bargain bin sseth lmao
Awesome video as allways grim
Wow... this was awesome
It was your Settra video that got me into Total War and Warhammer as a whole, not even kidding, I'm now deep into the Warhammer 40k and fantasy lore and have nealry 200 hours in TW:W3 now, thank you Kleaper for showing me the pearly gates and fiery hells of the insanity that is this game!
34:40 Needless to say the end times (with all triggers) is madness. It's like losing 2 to 10 years of lifespam.
These are always S tier
hell yearh
I have been waiting for another 1 of these videos from you since I started playing the game, ty for blessing me on a tuesday.
Ive never seen such based memes incorporated into an incredibly edited warhammer video. Thank you very much sir.
This is amazing. Its also about my favorite faction and lorde so this shivers all my timbers.
Ay a new one! Been waiting a while for this one. Thanks for still making them.
These are videos are litterly my favorites
After seeing you wearing that leather plague outfit you have now been unoficially dubbed by my brain as "The Gimp Kleaper". May this ruin your day as badly as it did mine.
I have no idea what’s goin on but this is so entertaining
Do you still get the “Total War” achievement if you go to War with every race on the turn you encounter them? I tried to get this with Skarbrand but ended up missing a couple of factions so I gave up.
lubeless
Love your content
Man this video is well made. Worth the wait for sure
Best warhammer video I've seen in many years! Glad to become a new subscriber.
You are going full time, that's great to hear. Hopefully we will get that twitch streaming juju again soon enough.
Nothing's more fun than grim playing total Warhammer
Please upload more ttw 3 vids theyre fucking amazing
Please make more total warhammer videos they are so funny!!
"Dwarven Slovenia"*is a bunch of trees* yeah that seems about right
Not me having Vietnam flashbacks of when I tried the "declare war on everyone - never make peace - win a campaign" achievement in Total War: Napoleon. Not quite the same scale of course but it was indeed extremely hilarious trying it with Prussia, going bankrupt in the first turn and deciding Russia is the only 18th century power that can piss off everyone and get away with it... long enough to win a historic campaign anyway. Much love and admiration to your work, it truly is a delight.
Ah of course how can I forget Willam Booty Catcher. His deeds almost match’s the Booty Warrior himself.
This video is the best thing to happen to me today. Work was shit, got horrible sleep last night, and I’m sick. This singlehandedly made me regain my will to live
Maa man woke up and chose violence
That moment when Noctilus said "Its I hate snowing time" and I hate snowed all over the place had me in tears
2:40 You didn't eradicate world peace, you just made a very clear plan to it. Can't be at war if there's nothing to fight!
Heeeeees back
YAYAYA FULL TIME CANT WAIT TO SEE MORE LETS GO!!!!!
What’s the sea Shanty from the end?
Tbh, would love to see someone animate Grimmise over here gameplay, and I mean all of his gameplay-
I play with a mod that randomizes start positions which keeps things interesting
Damn , ur videos are pretty good man
VIVA PINATA I remember that game playing the demo bc I was so poor over and over again on the Xbox 360
You know things are bad when you outnumber them 1700 -> 14… and you’re losing   I was dying at that part 😂😂
this would explain where you've been for quite a while
You should play dwarves
Im happy whenever you upload total war
I love your videos
you try to play as taroux i think his name is, the brace bull dude from the beastmen and see how much hell you can rip through as a angry man bull
I don't even play Total War, nor I'm interested in the Warhammer universe. That's how good these videos are.
That is such a belakor move
American National anthem intensifies
This video is top notch 👍👍👍
North Korea Simulator 2023
Such a cool video, loving it. I’m glad you’re full time now so you’ll post more often
Your ad sponsor almost killed me literally. When you called the Italian navy a freaking pizza, which it is, I almost choked to death on my soup. Im so upset about this and I can’t comment on PlayStation I pulled up my phone and found your video again just to say this.  .v.
Excellent commentary 👌
the amount of editing this takes respect
Hey @The Grim Kleaper, you didn’t credit Makeup and Vanity Set at 3:00 in the description
15:37 was so fun
Nice! Love to hear more content!
BRIGADOR MUSIC?!?!? MAKEUP AND VANITY SET MUSIC?!?!?
31:42 those names xD
Pascifism for the peace god killed me
Pls and I mean plsss make a TW3 video on skarbrand pls
time to reject monke and return to lizard, funny medicine man will you simp for the frogs next playthrough?
It's feels like a fever dream.
Dammmmnnn the production !!!! I really enjoyed this
Great vid as always
I hate to bring this up now, but there is a declare war on all factions mod with the steam workshop
It would be awesome if you did a collab with brilliant stupidity🫡
Eyyy Count Nocti! my favourite lord to play! EDIT: also yes. nocti is better off his mount. used to use him as my solo wall cleaner in siege battles. man can take the battle solo! :D
This was absolutely fantastic!
you absolute madlad!
I approve of Crab Army!
Man I watch all your content, leave for like 5 months come back and rinse and repeat. I fucking love this channel
Well done
I think the trait limit is actually 40, but you get invisible traits when trait challenges are partially completed, which eats up a trait slot.
I never like videos But this one… This is the one. Make more.
I love all your videos and content keep up the good work Kleap I'm sure you'll make it to a mil in no time
Love your warhammer videos
MOAR!
Well damn, you sold me on Vampire Coasts. Well played sir.
Vampire coast, aka, "we have napoleon total war at home"
Definitely one of the games of all time.
Truly a glorious day when the Grim kleaper blesses us with his presence  Praise the bird man ＼⁠(⁠^⁠o⁠^⁠)⁠／
LETS GOOO FULLTIME!
Props for using the Brigador OST. A true man of culture. 💪💯
I haven't laughed this hard since vanos
Truly one of the rational decisions of all time
Love these Warhammer videos, they are insanely fun to watch
I bet kleaper is cute under that plague doctor mask... also great video <3
PvZ music is just perfect
I've been binge watching all your videos and love the pacing and comedy in each one. Thanks for the great entertainment.
Ngl step 3 caught me off gaurd bc I'm watching this while playing war thunder
Can't wait
Ok but how many kills did God-Noctilus get when he solo'd Belakor at the end?
My dude is not starting world war 3, he’s starting galaxy war 20 by skipping everything else
This game looks so much fun but I don’t want to buy 2 other games and all the dlc to play this mode
I chuckled when he said 1.1k weapon damage, as i got more with skarbrand without the sword of kain. Then i thought about skarbrand with the sword of kain. I promptly wet myself
its like the march of the ents, except sponsored by the NRA
And so i Bring Them War
An absolute MASTERPIECE
Globin army when
ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY
Grim
34:44 YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
So glad i found this channel
Make a hole goblin army
Why are you here
If i could mainline endless videos of this quality into my veins 24/7 i might
Good Vid 👍
Love the war hammer videos
Bro your shit is criminally good
Keep up the fantastic work, these videos are absolutely gold! Would love for you to make a chaos dwarf video since they came out. ❤
these vids are always an amazing treat
William Booty Catcher 👌
Best wishes
Idk if its the accent or the cleverness but man this guy is pure gold. Love this content
Always love watching you TotalWarhammer videos
The edit is top notch! usually total war video's bore me to death (playing it is always fun but watching ehh) but the video is just **mwah** chef kiss.
That's got to be the best (vamp)pirate I've ever seen...
12:50 The generic problem with wielding the Sword [of Khaine] is that it will make everyone declare war on you.   For us that’s not a problem but a feature.
More total war warhammer for sure! :D
I really wanna see a Alith Anar run
oh
the alarielle part/edit killed me lmfaooooo
Les goooo more content
Man so much warhammer content and it’s only Monday, salty my laptop cord broke and sad that I can’t play it
Your channel is like if Sseth did Lets Plays, and every word you utter is dripping with distilled 'didn't ask' energy. I am here for it.
The joke at 17:35 is hilarious man 😂😂😂
I freaking love this guys videos, it’s a nice summary of a faction and he does it comes icky too please do wood elves next and give your grandpa Vietnam flashbacks
thank you for this video it unironically helped me get out of an existential crisis by making me laugh my ass off
"Greetings, we are a new civilization, and we come to-" War.
The ending though 😭
Great video as always and congrats on the sponsor! keep up the amazing work! <3
I’d say skaven give them a run for their money
I can't believe you didn't quote, "I don't want peace. I want problems." Love the videos though, Grim!
Cool now play the Ogres.
The Halt Faction ability is actually disgusting. You just lose a turn because some blue bird decided to fk with you for no gain
Great video to randomly click on. I havn't even played a game like this in years. Great all around really, a bit much to take in when you dont know the game but well edited/commentated. Glad you can do it full time now~ cheers
Please do a sun eater video
Warhammer vids are Always nice
Hope you play frostpunk one day
my god...this youtuber is amazing !
9:08 "wood elves in the ocean!" Truly the most horrifying prospect ever.
I appreciate the effort that goes into the subtle audio jokes that play ever so briefly
Noctilus is truly an American patriot. Why? Because smooth bore black powder cannons are completely unregulated by the ATF, NFA and aren't even considered firearms. Our boy Noctilus heard about this little fact and made it his niche.
The editing and voice over was top notch this video
Funny how your starting a World War and you not playing as the Orcs.
I waitad the masterpiece rhat is your video for what i feel being 20 years.
This is 100% my favourite warhammer total war video you've done, thanks Kleaper!
The content is so good that I spend weeks watching the Warhammer videos on this channel.  I am extremely happy that the channel is doing well.
Genuinely funny video awesome work
Another good video from one of my favorite people. Keep it up!
I love these videos keep them coming!!!
You and PancreasNoWork should do a collab
Love it
"Diplomacy is Cringe" -Count Noctilus
Babe, wake up. Grim Kleaper uploaded
Too many armies cause lag? Just destroy them. :T
I love your videos keep it up!
The more total war you play the happier I am, God bless Kleaper (also do Chaos Dwarves next with a doomstack of dreadquake mortars)
I wonder how well morghur would do with this, early on he can handle settlements by himself even without the sword of khaine, and he starts with regen and has the same horde mechanic along with a mortis engine. The only issue is you wouldn't get the pretty map painting quite like noctilus
The chosen one is back
The greatest Total War Warhammer 3 content creator has gifted us with a fourth installment! Everybody revel! Rejoice! Make merry!!!
amazing content bro
What difficulty my dude?
Sega needs to sponsor you.  This vid ( and Setra's brilliant run ) convinced me to buy the game.  😂
Chaos Dwarves? Pls? Also, love your videos and how you're able to condense games that take a really long time into a relatively short video. Can't wait to see more!
35 minutes I’m doing this then building a lego set    This is a good day
Vampire Coast is my favorite faction, your beat the Crab out of joke is one major reason why
That minimum wage joke made me laugh out loud for a good 30 seconds and I had to subscribe after that lol
The German experience.
Bro playing as nazi germany. Epic
VERY happy to know you are a plague doctor in real life tbh
Yay a warhammer video
I couldn't hold my laughter with Sword of Khaine being under new management LMAOOO
Oh blessed with another Grim Kleaper video AND it’s warhammer oh what great day.
If you do this as Orion you get free upkeep on your armies
One of the best and most entertaining Total War video  that i've ever watched
Now we send this Count Noct save file to LegendofTotalWar for a Doomstack rating 😂
Not sure if it is mentioned yet, but it is very suitable that your master plan with Sigvald was ruined by Be'lakor.. The shadowy schemer and manipulator, and your unofficial earlier "ally."
2:01 I'd say that makes you quite hardcore.
The funny guy is back!
🥰🥰🥰
2:50 back to that guy
With how often war is declared on me in this game, mind as well war everyone. Lulz.
Noctilus was my first campaign I did in a Total War Warhammer, so this is nice.
How to be more Khornate than the Khornate faction themselves...
i love these videos so much they make really save my days whenever you upload them💜
Who the heck says in a fantasy game you need fantasy weapons? Modern weapons are ALLOWS superior
Babe wake up, Grim Kleaper posted another WH3 vid
I absolutely loved your other warhammer videos, the Skaven and Tomb Kings got me into the series! Keep up the great series and I can't wait to see more from you!
Omg a GK vid!!
I can never understand how archeon dies within the 5 turn's of the majority of time for players. Every single game i've had in warhammer 3 archeon has made it to endgame
Ngl your WH3 videos are the best on YT
"a business deal, but there is no business, there is no deal and we threaten you with a gun" so it's a business deal, but honest
WarHammer is one of those games that I keep meaning to play but I really need to learn the bindings first or tape my monitor with a dozen sticky notes around the edge. :p
Positive comment
Finally, a new video, thanks for 35 minutes of pure joy
14:22 Based
Im genuinly surprised that you managed to go this far with those basic ass gunners. Every time I play as Vampire Coasts those fuckers are straight up useless. I don't know if they fixed them but last time I played them they were just standing there and not shooting at all.
pacificism for the peace god. Why am I laughing my ass off it isn't even that funny but i just can't stop laughing. what kind of foul spell did you cast at 31:57
You one upped yourself, what a masterpiece of a video. Laughed like hell. Good job man.
This man needs merch
👍
YES! YESSSSS!
Ah.. That SC1 music in the background brings nostalgia every time... In addiction with your commentary and gameplay it's all I need to have an awesome evening
NICE. I've been hoping for more Total Warhammer from you. Noctilus v. Door actually made me laugh out loud, not just exhale through my nose or chuckle.
Hell yeah, brother.
Finally I have been waiting for soonlong
Bro, AoE II music? I have it pulled up atm too, tripped me tf out.
That moistcritikal goofy comment got me
Congrats on full time!
this is great
These videos single handedly made me want to play warhammer again
Finding your Skaven Video was the second greatest thing that happened to me. I instantly fell in love with your videos and humour and binge watched all your videos. Oh if you are wondering what the greatest thing is that happened to me: I Found 5$ on my birthday outside a Rewe.
Belicor(?) deserved it
Yo what was that song at the end? Its sounds badass
Your total war videos are absolute gold - keep it up, sir! And if you can’t, don’t worry - we have pills for that
This was 11 out of 10, goddamn this is the most interesting and entertaining Warhammer Immortal Empires video I have seen ever! And I saw some pretty fucked up cheese already! Goddamn this was good, thank you and hope you keep this insane shit up!
Thank you for bringing the good old fun back to yt😂❤
Me when memes
Yaaaasss daddy you are full time
I'd loved to have seen a 100+ hour super cut of this, I'm sure It'd be a funny watch in between the hours of silence
Getting cucked by Bel'akor. Now that's is funny.
I reall Wish a dlc and more characters for vampire coast!
another great video!!always looking forward to new content
We need more of warhammer 3
I absolutely *love* your Warhammer content. I found your channel with the Skaven video and I have watched all the rest of the Warhammer vids about a hundred times each. Keep up the great content!
Now do it again as Chaos Dwarfs.
Very entertaining!
Dude I never even thought of the 40/20 army cheese. That is awesome. My undead games are going to be wild.
I'd love to see a pacifist Khorne campaign.
Karl Franz being op makes sense due to him having Ghal moraz
This was a great watch. Thank you, good sir.
I now want the Manifest Destiny Noc as a wallpaper
I played war thunder for 15 hours today don’t remind me of it 😭
Why no one talks how the song of the spooky pirates of this games is SO GOOD?
You just condensed over a hundred turns of intense warfare into the best 30 minute total war video I've ever seen. You are gifted.
great, now take over the whole map as someone (preferably Tzeentch)
Genuinely the narrative of this video Is amusing without the gameplay 🤣
10:26 "Tzeentch is a massive asshole"  Lore accurate then.
After 300+ turn, the game just lag so much that it's unplayable. I can't blame you. great video
Love your videos man! Hopefully going full time means more Warhammer
we need more wh3!
Please make more Warhammer 3 videos they’re so good and the reason I got into the game
Congrats on going full time! Hope this means we'll see more goofy Warhammer 3 videos!
Damn, a viva pinata refrence? I loved that game growing up, did not expect it to come up here
Congratulations on making it to full time.
Its almost a tutorial
Belakor serves the chaos gods once again, clearly tzeentch just used him to troll you and stop you from truly ascending with the last trait
Perfection!!Need more of these
Massive w
My man zooming in on the Germany flag when talking about committing war crimes 🥹
Awesome stuff!
i just laguhed my ass off when he said to khorne's sword "its a feature". Man how long it takes to make a video like this?
Great editing!
Not to be rude but I have to ask, when will you continue the tomb kings challenge or will you not?
Could you make a video of Dwarfs? They are racist and can be very funny to hate every other race because they don't have a good beard/beer :)
THE KING IS BACK
Absolutely loving the Total Warhammer videos, keep it up!
So this is the true power of met-wooden gear that snake was trying to warn us about.
I will perform the same ritual as with all these Warhammer videos and watch this 10 times over 😌
Love your videos man
I loved the map summary in the middle of the video.
great video! loved the narration of this campaign. happy to see you're using memes sparingly
Ooh, new vid
11:05 Same as the guy who made a mod that shows the correct glyph when you search a ruin.
it doesn't matter how long those elves trained, they brought a spear to a gunfight.
11:03 So funny thing about the treasure maps in Warhammer 3... using the "Go to location" button, takes you straight to the point you need to dig at. Yeah, its dumb.
29:30 "when you outnumber them 1700 to 14 and you're losing", ah I love the Warhammer universes.
I feel like the fact that this is even possible is a mark of failure for CA.
I love these videos they are just the best😂❤❤
I can't play warthunder anymore
You had khornes sword for so long he became subservient
LegendofTotalWar: Hey I've seen this one before, it's a classic!
I loved the music at the end
Pacifism for the peace gooood!!!
Lets goo new episode
theese videos are amazing !!! keep it up !!!!
100/10, as always
GG
Man it would’ve been funny if the chaos dwarves were here too
Nice vid grim
This video made my day, just brilliantly well done lol
You have litterally decided to upload night before my exam so i will do the logical thing and watch this video
I love it when Kleaper releases these videos. Somehow they can only get better, now we have reached the Undead US Navy
luv ur vids and u (purely homosexually)
good
Please my man, make more Total War Warhammer content. You are one of the best.
The best birthday present ever
This is Dr. Sex Approved
One and a half hour of rotting zombies and decomposing ships shooting rustiy muskets and cannons. One and a half hour of the best entertainment out there
Dude ur warhammer 3 vids are my favv
How about you to declare war on some women instead
>Cambodia >shows Japan  Lol
unfathomably based
More Warhammer and Rimworld.
I feel like it will be fantastic to watch this man play The Darkest Dungeon
Shoutout to the Viva Pinata reference, underrated game about cannibalism and exploiting animals as entertainers for massive profit
He's not kidding when he says armies will sail out to fight you  I started a campaign as the Dreadfleet about a week ago and even when not at war with everyone, you still get armies from god knows who coming to your capital, a full stack of Skaven got itself killed with ocean attrition sailing to Gallion's Graveyard
Yay the Grim Queefer uploaded
You can get a mod for this
Fun thing about those traits is that while there is a limit of 30, you might not get 30 as even going in to force march once, for example, locks in the resultant trait as one of the 30, but does not tell you until you have met the requirements for it to appear.  Having a general do every action once, fight every faction once, and hang out in low control settlements with construction for one turn will lock out over half your trait slots and give back nothing.
Moar Total Warhammer plz.  kthxbye
HE LIVES!!!!!
So mister Kleaper. Video is absolutely amazing. Any way I could support you in your full time slacking in front of video editting tool ? Patreon or better onlyfans ?
W
Yay new video
The pace and tone of all of grim’s videos make them 1000% better
Game: So what endgame scenario do you wan-  Grim: BITCH I AM THE ENDGAME
Let me say this once: We want you to make more Total War Warhammer videos. This was amazing.
This is first class entertainment!  👍
YOU CAN PLAY AS A DINOSAUR???
This is a great video and just because of this i will use this great link to a game where I can leak secret informations about tanks of the 1940s lol
Singehandly got me into this series of games and I’m about to play my first campaign thanks dude these videos are crazy
❤️
Im commenting to help vid engagement to help the video win over the youtube algorythm. I will also be replying to my own comment to further make the algorythm think your video has people talking to eachother.
yeah auto resolve calculation is super weird... i had in Warhammer 1 a Kholek Doomstack with 19 Shaggots, especially against big cities and sometimes dwarfs, i had many bad auto resolve predictions for battles, that weren't even challenging...
what is the name of the song of thefinal battle?
I know it takes 2-3 months for every vid, but the degree of comedy the Script has is amazing and worth the wait
Ahahah crad!!!!
Another TW video, I'm so happy to see it
He's making banger after banger now and I'm very scared of what Grim could do.
Jesus loves you
These videos are the best Warhammer videos I have ever seen, keep doing what your doing.
Use the "cheese" Heal always on Units. Lords have a way better Heal Factor after a Battle - especialy the Undeads. Did a similar challenge - i used a 2nd Army that never left the side of Nocti , but cotained ONLY Zombie Melee Pirates (cheap ones) and used them as canon fodder. What´s the worst thing that could happen to them ? Die again ? Who cares. And since Nocti & his Lords are Vampires - u also have the chance of a whoopin 50% to resurrect a destroyed Unit after the Battle.
Probably the only youtuber that can convince me to download a sponsored game. 😂
Here we go again!!!! This is going to be fun!!!
deficit spending was the name of the game for my total war 3 kingdoms playthrough with Lu bu. I only ever got out of the red and sorta not at war with people at the end of the game
finally a real challenge
Very entertaining video! If you want to try this again, I recommend playing Orion. He gets bonuses for how many factions he’s at war with, meaning you basically get free armies.
She has never done anything in my games but for you she gets the sword of kaine
Each time you upload new video my day gest so much better Kleaper, Thank you!
Alternate title: spreading freedom and deregulated guns to all in total war warhammer 3
FULL TIME LEZZZZ GOOOOOOO!!!
I love this man !
i would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for DOOR!
I noticed when u have taken over the Middle ring island you´re economy gets broken and goes pass 1 million  due to all the harbour towns
Babe wake up a new Grim Kleaper video is out
I love your stuff, good concepts and well edited videos. But the jokes... I could do without. A crutch you don't need.
This feels entirely in-character with the Lord he picked.
A new total warwarhammer video and a long one at that. My day has automatically been made much better
I like this new remake of Pirates of the Caribbean
11:57 oh god, nostalgy
Who needs friendship when you have guns? -every American ever.
Putin taking notes
16:51 RUMBLING, ITS COMING RUMBLING
I love this idea
What a great script. Had me laughing the whole time. Good stuff
I love ur content so much. The way u commentate everything is so funny and the video ideas are cool on their own but u make the 1000 times better
Yeeeeeesssssssss
THANK GOD THE RAVEN BOI CAME AND WENT FULLTIME NOW I HAVE REASONS TO SNEAK OFF TO THE BATHROOM TO WATCH VIDEOS
You better keep that TW3 content coming, otherwise I will send the papa Kholek to your doorstep.
14:20 Sheer unwashed masses of ... sheer unwashed masses.
He's Alive!
nice video, sseth
"That is a lot, of naked green men" is one heck of a quote 5:06
The best faction to declare war on everyone is Orion's wood elves. You get less upkeep per enemy you're at war with. Eventually, you are paying zero upkeep for dozens of armies. It is glorious.
This man isn't speaking english in this video he's speaking american 🔥🔥🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
I feel like with every Total War Warhammer video you upload, there comes up another faction that I'd love to play as when I once buy the game
Ok this genuinely looks fun. I’mma try this myself some day.
LOVE your content bro! Genuinely laughed the whole way through... keep up the awesome work!
Damn I wish I knew how to edit like you
I missed your video from Warhammer soo much mate  <3 Soo, thank you <3
This seems like playing Skarbrand with extra steps.
Love ya vids man
I cast GUN!!!!
Needed this today thanks Kleper
Seems like the author is copying the Sseth style in his speech and video edits.
When he went “this is total war” and total warred everyone made me shiver
This is an hour old video, I just finished it's 35 minute runtime. 25 minutes into it being posted, I started it. I knew not. I only saw a TW:WH3 Grim Kleaper video, and knew i'd enjoy my time. I am happy to see more will come.
I would say khorn should have been played  *but then I remembered khorn is surrounded*
Cool
PVZ MUSIC 10/10
You are the definition of it's only a war crime if it's committed during war time.
Literally the best channel I found a few of your rimworld  vids ago and have binging everything twice since Keep it up!
“Babe! Babe! Wake up! Kleaper posted a Warhammer 3 video!”
Cant wait for new vids 🎉🎉
Noktul literally becoming the pirate king
I'm pretty sure you would really enjoy playing Skarbrand if this kind of hell is what you unleash with Noctilus
hold on  Full time TGK ?  This is a blessing
Love your yearly Warhammer video's
A viva piñata reference in 2023? Someone else actually knows about that game?
Congrats on the sponsor! It's great to see your channel grow
UR AN OGGGGG
In the final battle how many kills did our Psycho Pirate Lord get?
YEESS More Warhammer
Grim Kleaper TW Warhammer video, my favorites
i imagine this actually helps promote world peace, all the factions will get a relationship buff with each other due to their mutual hate of you
Hello.,.,.,.,..,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,
9:54 Me when the fbi agent asks me where I was on september 8th, 2022
So this is what happened to Davy Jones after pirates 5
THE PSYCHOPATH BEING SO CURRENTLY RELEVANT HOLY SHIT
oh my god he uploaded
Enemy: looks like we defeated the army  Undead pirate boy: :( *In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the land seeking vengeance against the lords who had wronged him. He wore the pirate hat of death, and those that tasted the bite of his khaine sword named him... the Doom Slayer
I was hoping this was coming lol. Surprised he didn’t use Orion though
by the gods hes back again
Chaos Dwarfs NEXT!!!!!!!!
Yasss ma man is backkkkk
Moans
Please make more ❤❤❤❤
I think you should stream your content on twitch and make videos out of them like this one! I would love to watch all 1000 hours of gameplay from you!
YEEEEEES!

Ah, the Skarbrand experience
A POOOSSSSTTTTT!!!!!

Algorithm Support
Yippppppppppppppiiiiiiii🎉
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees i have been waiting for another one
Can't believe it took 3 games for Total Warhammer to become about Total War
Is it possible to see your Warhammer campaigns in complete as a live stream or something. And nice video
Your editing style reminds me of martincitopants lol love the warhammer content
He’s alive
I really love these Warhammer videos
Yes! More Warhammer. I really love your Warhammer content! <3
...wait, how good is auto resolve in this game?
35 MINUTES OF GRIM WH3???? Holy shit man you’ve spoiled us Thank you so much for this funny and well structured content
These are easily my favourite total war videos
Can't wait till you do a chaos dwarves video
warthunder ad on warhammer video. WHAT A GENIOUS
A new video 👀
As an economy student I confirm that femboys are the best GDP producer
praise the great grim kleaper
I feel like he's reached internet historian status. Where every time he uploads they're bangers, but he only uploads once every fifty years.
if you happen to do something like this again, you gotta name one of your lords, "Warren the Warmongering War Lord" W.W.W, for short
The quality has gone massively up recently and I'm loving it
can you start streaming warhammer 3 please.
Classic American Moment. Standard pirate experience.
bro ı respect your work (its hard to make  edits tho) <3
Loved the last one and was waiting for another, probably watched the other 3 Warhammer videos like 10 times each.
Wtf does "femboys in cambodia" over a picture of japan mean
normal game on legendary difficulty
