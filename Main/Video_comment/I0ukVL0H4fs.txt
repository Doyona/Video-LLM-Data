The guy knew straight away who he was
Man didn't question it, was just super supportive and great 😂
I swear before he became a rockclimber he was an actor lol
clocked
00:15  that’s my climbing gym 😂😂😂
less to live for is SO FUNNY
So funny😂😂😂❤it
Looks like a homeless, not an old man
Mixing in the German too 😭
You need to bring that trainer back.  What a great human being.   Even if I was the best, I would let that kid coach me.  He has IT...
You cannot hide a face like yours, Magnus. Your features are far too striking.
well i would instantly recognize your voice^^
welche zug?
毎回毎回変装がバレてないと思ってるところがキュートで好き。どこからどう見てもマグナス。
he plays a quite convincing german grandpa
It’s crazy to me how no matter what the disguise, he still looks undoubtedly like himself
Of all these ‘undercover’ episodes, the gal from the 2nd is clearly the best teacher. She was giving concrete advice and strategy the whole time.
His hands look like the hulk. Who would buy this?
climbing with a scarf haha whaat
Cameraman is LDS?
If I ever see that belayer he has earned several smacks
Dude wtf you are insulting the 90s no bouldering I will smack you when I meet you.
Big shout out to Kieran at Foundry; taught my son and I lead climbing a few years ago and not looked back since!
As a german i have to say we don‘t speak that good english 😅 for me it sounds like nativ speaker
At this point it’s just people playing along with pretending not to know who Magnus is.
beard fell apart. lol
The Coach all the time: that’s fine 😂
6:05 his nuts 😆😆
you don't look like an oldman, you look like a hobo
What a fun coach, no bants like Irish bants.
Bro these types of videos are SO corny and cringe
Magnus looks goofy as hell climbing
What in the Tim Robinson is going on here?
b
you're such a corn ball buddy
what a good sport, nice video
The accent is so inconsistent 😂😂😂😂
Never seen such a trendy " elderly german man"  with a cute cropped jacket and skinny jeans❤❤❤ His voice sounded too young for an elderly man😂 and he looks the same- just maybe dirty and unshaven, like he's been camping for 2 weeks😂😂😂
That instructor is actually really great. Gives him confidence but does make sure to check everything. He tries to give tips where possible and seems to be enjoying it. absolute legend
FairPlay, he was a good sport. He definitely worked out something was going on!
The simplest movements during a conversation, speech and make-up will convince only a blind person that he is 73. Theatre.
6:57
Lol as a makeup artist..what the hell..face looks dirty and lumpy he is supposed to be old not dirty
Wow that Old Guy sure took a pretty Weird Route
if he is pro why did he fall. that means if real mountain, he is ded. noob
Magnus really deserves an oscar for this acting 😂
Ungefähr 😂😂
That instructor is a legend! Super encouraging, friendly and mad knowledgeable. Respect.
The fact that his beard was literally falling off around 16:00 is the best thing. How did he not notice that?! 😂
10:53 😂
Face don't look real 😂
I'm old!!!
Ngl thought this was a JonTron Video
Olympics climb climb the mountain watch a video
Olympics climb climb the mountain
Olympics m
the german act works 🤣
"This is what we used in Normandy." That killed me.
Facial hair was done terribly
17:28 I love he just keeps pushing him regardless of his age
15:30 I’ve never heard someone use that phrase in such a nice mannered way 😂
I’m remember watching this video when it came out two years ago amazing how much time has already passed
peaks of yore
I hope I’m like that at 73
I have seen an actual old man flash a v10 (the highest in our gym), pretty sure he could do up to v12-14, dunno though
I've been to this exact place on a school trip
That disguise is so cheap. Everybody would realise that he don't have a strong German accent immediately 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The funniest part of this is the guy didn't fall for the prank but kept his suspicions quiet the whole time so the pro climber could do all the climbing and old man impressions he got dolled up for.  That's more entertaining than actually falling for it.
Who pranked who? 😀
Более тупой постановки я не видел. Конченые
Your hands look "YOUNG"!  :D It gives away, Your eves too, maybe contact lenses next time!   Amazing video by the way!
He knew immediately
Whoever did his makeup must be young because he only looks in his forties with the makeup.
There’s so many old people that climb nobody would care
old face but hands are obviously don't belond to a 73 year old man. Skin tells the age
Bro knew the whole time 💀
Bro nice enough not to notice that the beard looks like glued on dryer lint mixed with kitty litter
His beard just falling apart
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Still looks like Magnus. 😂
the Irish accent on you're man, is quality
”You dont look that different” 😅
late to the party but i love that magnus knows the german climbing commands
I don't think he suspected anything in the beginning, but I'm under the impression something changed after Magnus climbed  the 7c so effortlessly.
Ok, not sure how, but the youtube algorithm brought me here. I know nothing of this sport, but from a layman such as myself, that looks hard! But whats more entertaining is he's like undercover and its like the biggest insode joke lol. And yeah, I do know if one climbs they sweat a lot, or at least the body does warm up; and my point with this, is the hat and scarf. I just know if it were me, I'd be too hot and sweating my butt off.
Saying 73 was just stupid, he instantly knew you're trolling. 63 could have worked
*POV: replaying a game you already mastered*
I'm sure the professional camera filming them didn't raise any suspicion
6:04 the german impression is sending me every time
i hope this climbingteacher is aware of his natural talent of being super likable and motivating in the way he is speaking, commenting, reacting and so on.  The content, therefor the part with the knowledge is a learning-thing, nut not what i'm talking about. :-) <3
does magnus speak german? perfect immitation! nice details
You've got very youthful hands for a 70 year old Magnus even if you pretend to shake them LOL. And 30 years ago is just 1990s so yes people bouldered then😆 The sure giveaway of age is the neck and hands even if you can disguise the face. Wonder if the instructor noticed as soon as you used your hand to tie the knots and clip in - and is just playing along. I did a few climbs outdoors in my mid 20s but learnt it the very hard way in Yosemite against the face of solid granite some 30+ years ago. But never took up the sport - led a pretty much sedentary with work and family rearing. Recently did a climb in a gym and it all came back. Now that my grown son is getting into it - I might tag along just for a few climbs. So if someone at my low level can do it - yeah Magnus will still be out-climbing all the young guys at 70.
I got to be honest, this just seems like what Magnus would look like with a beard, glasses and wearing a flat cap. He doesn't really look, sounds or act a different age.
Waiting for Magnus to do same video when he really is 76 or something. I bet if he keep up with climbing and overall being active, it could be an interesting video
Great video! keep with the good work!
Easy to figure out if you just check the guy’s hands come on check the fingers what’s going on with those fingers, old man? 🙌🏼😂🙌🏼
"this isnt as bad as my way to school"
3:48 30 years ago🇫🇷🥖🍷
I love how he shake his legs like beginner. You’re not only good at climbing but also acting mate😂
Great fun to watch.
plinKs of yore 2
Yeah the 70 years of age definitely blew his cover immediately 😄
Friedrich looks just like Magknuss.
Friedrich sounds like Magknuss.
Lol at the norwegian verdammt
Bra jobba
10:53 "Old so less to live for" is diabolical 💀
Dude even leg twitch!!! that fucking diabolical HAHAHAHHA
props to the cameraman for being so stealthy
The way he just stares into the camera every time the cameraman asks a question is hilarious. 😂😂😂
I have never seen anyone wear a scarf while climbing 😂
That coach guy was awesome
In Italy Thera plenty of “via ferrata”.  Used back in the days for cross the mountain during war, prohibitionism and for smuggling. Nowadays are still used from alpinist, for Italian force training and from enthusiasts… really racomanded but safety always first!!
The thumbnail reminds me of Count Olaf in A Series of Unfortunate Events, but great video 👍
How does YouTube know I started rock climbing
Is the coach Irish
He barely changed his voice! And I love the scarf and hat… inside the gym!
Can Magnus speak German?
I´m really surprised how good your german accent is xD (I said that as a german)
Around 10 mins in 🤣 good acting
The instructor was so professional, smart, and good humored.  What an awesome guy.
Bist du deutsch
LMAO THAT FACIAL HAIR IS HORRIFIC
Imagine being fucking Norwegian Sweden #1 SVERIGE SVERIGE SVERIGEEEEE
12:02 😂😂 described him
Got to love the Irish he knew the whole time and was having some fun !  Perfekter duetcher akzent ! Danka
Yo that’s actually crazy you came to Sheffield! This is where I’m from, I just got in to climbing and found this video straight away, hope to meet you when you’re back!
I’m 71 and maintain mission and operational readiness and my interactions always result in the comment, “Gee Mr. ****** your older than my grandfather and there’s no way he’s able to be here and do this.”😂
Whats the point of all this?
hahaha his beard is falling apart
That german is hilarious
Bro when u start screaming my food just came out from my mouth because im laughing😂
the instructor: this must be Magnus´ uncle or something
well played
Peaks of Yore in real life.
I love how, in the middle of having a scandinavian accent, Magnus shows enough mindfulness to say "Oder?" to throw him off the trail.
"Move quick" to a 70 year old 😂
Magnus: pretends to be an old man Also Magnus: shows his hands which are visibly young looking
he's looking like an old Magnus...not really a good disguise
worst disguise ever
just from your eyes it is easy to recognize you , you can't disguise sorry
just from your eyes it is easy to recognize you , you can't disguise sorry
Copycat. Hot Dog Hans, aka Alex Ferreira.
2:46 - did Magnus fake the hand spasm or did he not realise it happened? If it was't part of the disguise he might want to get it checked out
A trainer who lets someone climb wuíth a scarf on? Realy???
Genau 😂
imagine the person belaying you isn't heavy enough and he flys up while you all
ee
He was too embarrassed to say he knew that perfect ass anywhere.
His beard keeps falling apart 😂🤣
That's literally the climbing gym i go to in Sheffield omds
21:03 used a blue???
You should do this when you are actually this age 💀
I love these videos because every time it’s just “Magnus pretends to be bad at climbing and then is good”
15:29 Thats wild!
Lol. Comically bad acting. Knows all the professional climbers and knots but thinks you're gonna use a 2 m long rope for climbing.
should have chain smoked some cigs so you sound a little more raspy
bro looks like trippie red
Honestly, good acting on the climb 👍🏽😁
this is what we used in germany...that line killed me, im dead, call a priest
Kieran has an Irish accent, this is in Sheffield? I think I heard Sheffield mentioned.
Im sorry but wtf is that beard, the hairs don't even look attached
The instroctur was so great. He most likely knew immedietly, but managed to keep his calm, hide his excitement and even started tongue-in-cheek messing with him throughout.  P.S. I find it so funny that Magnus wasn't sure if he knew, despite Magnus beard literally starting to fall off infront of him.
bro is smurphing irl
Smurfing my climbing lobbies smh
He's getting too good at the character imitation
We use a diffferent harness/ different carabina.
as a german u nailed the german accent😂
One of the funniest videos ever!
Count Olaf vibes.
John 16:33  "In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world."  Isaiah 41:10 (NIV)  "So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."  Philippians 4:6–7 (NIV)  Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  Psalm 34:4–5, 8  I sought the LORD, and He answered me and delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to Him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed. Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good! Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!❤  Jesus loves you all✝️💟 May God guide you throughout your whole entire life and lead you to the right path of life‼️‼️
Why pretend to be german lol
Magnus trying to climb like a Gumby is the best!!!
that beard holding onto dear life
"my arms are not so strong" get called bullshitting immediately lol
Instructor saying : cool you skipped a clip at the top....  He knows.
But Gullich was better..... When there are arguments Hubble might have been a 9a and earlier. Magnus knows the history and is stirring the controversy. Lolz.
Those cotton balls hanging off his face had me dying
“Cheeky knee good to see” was amazing
bro looks like he came straight out of Peaks Of Yore (look up game, its an amazing rock climbing game)
that instructor was top notch , his laughing was him just being flabergasted at the fact a 73 yr old man is destroying his workplace xD
you should come back when your 70 to the same coach and do some climbing
these videos make me laugh so much because magnus doesn't go half-way, he fully sends into his characters HAHAHA i think it's time to start pursuing acting
Why is this so convincing
I love how he always just looks like Magnus with shit stuck on his face 😂
22:15 when he laughs at how long the makeup took made me smile
The first coach looks like Emil Abrahamsson
I think the way he can disguise himself is by getting a spray tan and a dramatically different hair color like  red or brown or texture like curls
He said "genau" lol, thats a German word meaning "Exactly"
The fact I’ve been there
Had no intention of watching this today or going through the entire thing but that was entertaining as hell
I love how inconsistent the accent was, sometimes it was barely there and other times you could barely tell you were speaking english XD
We do a little trolling...
Epiioc
If you're going to do another one of these you have to do it a fat suit
I watched your channel a year ago and I still get your vids in my fyp why? Still watched this vid tho
I was once hiking up mount colden in the Adirondack mountains proceeded to climb to the top and sitting there was an 83 year old man proceeded to have an hour long conversation about hiking and how he had been a truck driver and all the amazing things he had seen
This guy gives me Anatoly vibes
7c+ on-sight…either he is playing along for the camera … or this guy can’t put 2 and 2 together 😂
Is he aware of the person filming him?
The beard falling apart kills me
The shaking leg was a nice touch
5:15 are you sure about that
magnus climbed unrecognized, but at what cost lol
LOL
How did no one question the fact he was climbing with a hat and scarf on lol 😂😂
i love how the climbing instructors are always pushing new climbers to not be scared of harder climbs
This coach is legit. Super knowledgable and clearly loves what he does. Good for him doing something he enjoys
Ngl, Iike old magnus fashion sense
i know nothing about rock climbing but if i were to try i want this guy to be my instructor.
Woah magnus, Didn't know you did more than chess.
😂😂😂had my best comedy watching you climb in this clothes, well done fredrick😂😂and your german accent smashes it🎉
"that is a major wanger!"
HAHAHA that shit was funny as hell. I think he knew earlier than he said.
"first you were a duck and then you were a chicken" omfg i love the coach. I want to be coached by this guy.
16:15 i get your chalk back for the next one / Magnus: ye thanks (annoyed) XD
TESTING
I like the yoghurt example!
I think the disguise was perfect but your posture gave it away, I mean this as a compliment
German accent sounded convincing haha.
you cant show up with a rinkly face and have "younger" hands
12:58 "Scheiße verdammt!" Nice detail! 😂
WHY ARE THE CHAPTERS CALLED "What is God" AND "Did the events of the bible really happen" 😭😭
That is one good coach right there!
i have never heard of this man yet he has 2.35 million subs
I wonder if Magnus actually thought nos his disguises are good? XD
B
Excellent instructor
Its a very short rope isn't it? Lmao
You need to get some contacts and try voice lessons to speak differently
I can imagine how uncomfortable he is in those clothes 😂
13:47 i %100 thought they were about to have a thumb war 😭
Magnus proves he is an egomaniac by doing this. It's not funny. It only glorifies him
Seniors don't wear pubes on their faces. That beard does NOT look natural.
Old man pretends to be a pro climber
Huuuuge wangers!!! Love it 💗
17:41 this is sus, lol  (I just mean it looks like the teacher's holding back a smirk)
8:34 why are they letting him wear a scarf?
5:35 i am way too prideful for all this
It’s honestly not that crazy I’ve seen someone in their mid 60 doing crazy problems
Everything is fake nowadays.
Dovresti fare video in un rocodromo dove ci sono molte altre persone e con una camera nascosta filmare le reazioni, sarebbe epico! Continua così 💪🏻
Not a good disguise
i didn’t see some parts of the video but i think it is staged because how did he not see the cameraman
My grandpa doesn’t need to pretend he’s been climbing for over 40 years
I am just here to call Frederick a ninny
“How old are you?”  “73.”  😂🤣😂🤣
i feel like the guy at the beginning knew right away, he was smiling and laughing. he knew for sure i think the whole time.
Always gotta texture the hands with the face! It passed this time...
that fake beard is terrible 🤣🤣
73 bruh you might have gotten away with early 50's but ain't no way he bought that
Not tryna ruin the video but this is obviously staged because of the microphone on the coaches shirt
has the voice of a 14 year old but whatever
This guy has way too much time on his hands.
This guy came out of nowhere on my feeds and now i am beinge watching his videos.
The coach is great and he kinda looks a bit like David Tenant.  What a kind man.
20:30 "before you die" had me bursting out laughing
the coach was fantastic. really fun video
73 was a stretch 😂 I was thinking in the 60s he was probably a little suspicious after u told him u were 73
This was so great!!!
You can't really hide how your your body moves. That is the main giveaway
That was a fun video to watch enjoyed both of you guys awesome dudes
There's something to be said about the strength of youth, but there's some older guys that have hardened muscles that just don't let go.
Sorry man, you definitely need better acting and wardrobe
Cant hide magnus voice. The less he talks the better.
Where is this?
If I made this kinda video, I'd make a birthday party with some other guys climbing, so that cameraman (with unprofessional camera, of course) won't look suspicious. The old man needs some approval from the other guests, like: "have you drunk your pills, grandpa?"  In the end all guests are encouraging the old man to try climbing himself, telling a tearfull story of his dream... 😏  So, It's just my thoughts, they could be grotesque, but you get the point. I think it's  a good idea for you to try to hire a specialist in the social engineering field 😁
witzig, wie er immer wieder deutsche wörter einwirft ;>
What a good instructor
How boring!
as someone who is named fredrick, hearing this man keep saying fredrick is throwing me off
Good one, but let’s do that again in 30 years
He does not look 73, lol!
I mean the out fit says it all
THey all knew lol. Fakest beard ever :D
Deine schauspielerischen Fähigkeiten sind wirklich grandios!  Wie Du sogar auch sämtliche typischen Anfängerfehler in Deinem Schauspiel mit dargestellt hattest. Und dann sogar das Kommando "Zu!" auf deutsch und auch noch andere deutsche Worte, wie "ungefähr".  Wirklich Klasse! 👍 😂  Hättest Du denn auch mithalten können, wenn der Trainer plötzlich angefangen hätte fließend deutsch zu sprechen, weil er es eben zufällig irgendwoher gekonnt hätte? 😉
The guy is awesome
hghj nice magnus
That there is the Friendly Guide👊 Hope you left a great tip my friend.
he just doesn't question why theres a cameraman?
I giggled, thanks!
Wonderful coach, such a nice voice of encouragement I love you man.  World’s a better place because of you.
Anatoly
If the hat and scarf didn’t make you suspicious. The Young man’s posture, movements, legs etc, would. You’d have to be pretty oblivious not to notice.
Could people waste their money on anything more easier and mundane,?
Climbing with a scarf XD
Somewhere along the way Magnus went from a shaky old man tenatively clambering to spidermanning up that wall.
When he heard 73 😂😂😂 lol I think he clocked then 🤣
As a german your accent is very funny to me. Because you get some german elements but sometimes the vowels sound like a french accent. For example in "try". And it matches somehow, because the french also have the hard "tr" in their language.
AND SHEFFIELD IN NEAR HILLSBROUGH AND WALKLEY
OMG IVE BEEN THERE BEFORE, ITS AT KALHEM ISLAND
The makeup is obviously fake. It can only work if they see him from a long-distance away. The clothes dont cover his strong looking frame either. Fail.
What a ridiculous spectacle. Why is it necessary to fool people? Just to make them feel bad on camera? So you can display it and make money? You owe this guy some portion of the proceeds from this video, considering you made a lot of cash off of his embarrassment and him being made the fool, and you did it all without his consent.  Smh frigging social media. This is exactly what those algorithms do- they turn every single thing into the lowest common denominator.
Unfortunately it was staged
Bro, your beard is falling off half way through lol, there is no way he didn't know the whole time lol
i'd be so worried 💀💀
His voice doesn’t even sound old….
I love how supportive he was 😂
I wasn't impressed with the gym dudes belaying skills he kept too much slack in the line in my opinion and shouldn't have had to go up in the air when the guy came off the wall. I'm easily 267 lbs and have people lighter than me belaying for me and they don't end up in the air like that.
5:16 "AND HIS NAME IS... JOOHN MAAGNUUUS!"
Excellent❤
Bros looking like Jim Carrey's count Olaf from lemmonys snickets a series of unfortunate events
He knew the instant he saw his face 🤣
I came for the usual magnus’ prank video but I staid for listening to the man coaching.
I found Magnus through Storror, and I'm am SO HAPPY that I did. :D Him and Pete. This man is a legend, and he's funny. Nothing but respect.
The instructor is world class.
Can you speak german?
The instructor didnt know him lol or if it had a disguise on, you can tell.
I was a bit surprised when 8b+ was called out as the grade to shoot  for to be the ‘worlds strongest old man’. I bet that’s off by at least two grades.
21:15 When he nailed the dyno on the 8c the music was perfect! Gave me a real LOL!
Dude should have worn different clothes like a tracksuit or something! But brilliant nonetheless.
Lmao funny couch kind of unhinged hahaha enjoyed this
Tbh it's usually the old guys at my gym who are smashing the hard routes 😂 that technique
"Old man" looks the same age as the cilmber
The coach is cute ngl, I’m not particularly interested in climbing but I watched the whole thing for him 😂
Magnus tying the knot without looking wasn’t a give away at all.. lol
I lost it when Magnus started screaming 🤣
Climbing boulders without rope was all the climbing we did as kids. Gyms and rope are luxury items when you're a free range child.
"Okay, now do these routes that I can't climb" Is so funny if he actually thought you were some boss old man.
Guy sounds Irish and then say 'ungefahr' in german?
“First you were a duck and then you were a chicken”😂😂😂
So much fun
12:50 scheiss verdammt haha
what a dance up there xD
The charisma and genuine good energy of some people. If we would pay people based on that, this instructor would be rich.
When patches of your beard are just falling off, the jig is up.
Anyone else think this was Jim Carrey as Count Olaf?
funny how magnus sprinkles in other accents as well here and there like Swedish and even French??
What’s crazy is he always looks like magnus
Magnus was so ungrateful and butthurt that the guy played along and didn't ruin the video...he's kind of an asshole underneath but tries to hide it.
No one is fooled by this
The coach was so patient and kind! Love it
cmon this is ridiculous. Bro could tell right away you were wearing a disguise.
I know he's from Sheffield but I can't help but think "Wales? That you?" with this instructor.
8:31 PTSD kicking in lmao
I’m 34 and just getting into bouldering, currently climbing V2 or thereabouts. There are dudes at my gym who are easily 70 doing V7 and higher, props to the guys who say no to “I’m too old for this shit”
Love he Irish babble lmao
That makeup was terrible, lol. And they didn't do the neck or hands, which is an instant giveaway. Doubt that guy actually bought it.
when you got shaky on the pink, superb acting
this couch loves his job... cool dude
The elbows were going up like a chicken. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm watching this for the second time. It's so funny!
This was ridiculous..
Jojo character: "the stand user could be anyone" The stand user:
Disguise was a bit shite the pubelike beard was even falling away.
So his stuck on beard hair starts to fall out and we are expected to believe that the instructor hasn't notice....really?
give this man an oscar
the butt gives it away. no old men has a smashable buttocks like that.
The trembling legs and screaming when almost at the top were so damn funny. You're a comedian Magnus ;-)
Hilarious! Some good old feel good content! No adds just friendly banter!! Well done. That kid was a good sport too.  Thanks
You gave it away when you said at 1:20. “The bolts are far apart”.  A guy this old wouldn’t have likely sport climbed.
God bless and much love to you all❤🙏
pls add in your videos at the end like extra content how you climb the hardest path in the hall with your climbing gear would be a nice addition to the revealing end :)
He's such a good climber that, not only can he climb bad on purpose and make it look legit, which is hard enough as it is, he can do it in different styles.
That's actually very convincing, Magnus is a good actor. It's not just the makeup and clothes, it's also the way he moves, the little mannerisms, the attention to detail and a whole bunch of other things. Well done.
Me ? I've had a 43 break from climbing, and I'm 43. This video gives me the courage to stay seated and watch more climbing videos. Go Magnus !
3334
When you're so famous people can tell who you are by the way you climb. That explains all of the old man jokes. I was about to say, this guy is kind of a jerk to say these things to an old guy 😆
"I suppose less to live for"  🤣
the makeup looks horrible. im not convinced anyone bought it
Пригожин
Which gym is that?
Spoiler: he knew
your guides are always the stars. The are so involved and happy. I love the climbing community.
Haha
Autobelays??! No-noh!
"Ungefähr zehn Meter" 😂 bester Mann 👍
This guy knows as soon as minute 3 xD
The instructor is adorable and so positive 😊
On the tumbnail, you look like Jim Carrey. But you surely already read that...
The coach is not fooled at all... he never actually is concerned about a 73 year old man hurting himself.
Proper Irish man offering the lads a cuppa char. Character as well, knows his stuff and doing what he loves. Credit to all
bruh 73? that gave it away if he didnt knew already cmon
The coach is awesome!!
This was great.😆
So if he's gonna keep displaying poor form and cutting loose early, then what's the point of the video?
After 3 hours of makeup...you better not disappoint Grandpa Frederick 😅
On-site 5.13 with rental shoes is crazy!
pretty fun watch
06:04 "Genau", He even used the word in a way a old german men would use the word xD. Such a good german imitation.  edit: After watching the whole video, I saw many good "german" moment xD great job ^^
German old men would never be able to speak english so fluently 😂
Good for him playing along
Dudeman fakes being old to pull a prank while there's actually a old guy climbing on the next wall.
Haha so interesting😂
Magnus' jawline ruins it for him, lol.
At 16:20 the beard looks like it's coming off in chunks.  Guy doesn't say a word!😮
Magnus get a prosthetic nose added for make up it will change your face a lot and not obstruct your climbing.
Ok, this is how you pretend to be german, not in the silly US style. Perfectly done
“Hi YouTube I’m magnus midtbo 🤓🤓”
Hello Magnus, I saw your very first video couple days ago which was the video where you pretended the same thing but dressed as Johanes from Finland. When I was watching the video I had no idea of your real personality and how you are as a person. Your pretend personality put me off and I thought to myself this guy is so cocky. Oh how wrong I was, I apologize. I've been binging your videos for the past couple days and you're an amazing climber. Congratulations on free soloing with Alex. Your free solo video was the reason I watched his documentary which spiraled into me watching more of your videos. I have never thought I'd be interested in climbing myself but after seeing your many videos, I want to say that once I lose some weight I will begin learning how to climb and you were my insipration for it. Keep on doing you Magnus, awesome content!
obviously he knows but the A for effort! and entertainment hahaha
guys an actor too lol
Cheers @ the climbing coach!! The dude seems rad as chit and is for someone I would loved o have climbed with  in younger years. I hope you all tipped him well !
Hahaha
Take that Frederick
Funky. That pink one would be a 5.8 or 5.9 at some gyms near me, not a 5.10a.
Can’t wait to magnus actually becomes old and tricks all the new wall climbers.
“Take that Fredrick, you piece of shit”
Magnus’s disguises all look like Magnus 😂
he deserves an Oscar
All old people are like this in Sheffield
i cant stop laughing when magnus deliberately violently shakes his legs 😂
Imagine asking a 73yo German if he knows what yogurt is 🤣🤣😭😭
How does the dude not know something is up lol,…so he did know,should of went to a gym where no one knew you
You lost when you said you were above 70 instead of in your 60s
MAGNUS...THE WORST ACTOR IN HISTORY..
I really appreciate the many perfectly placed german words.
I like how cheerful the guy is
He looks so unreal ^^ Just like a young guy pimped with grey beard
Why hes used to be a GERMAN grandfather xD
The leg shakes had me DYIN LMAO
Excellent instructor
Man his beard is falling off 😂
He knew exactly from the very start
Wolfgang Güllich! A legend in climbing, died by a car crash driving home at night from a radio interview. He climbed do dangerous routes and then he crashed into with a car....
I don't climb at all but been watching your video since the pandemic. lol
Love this guy’s attitude. He is hilarious
What a likeable instructor, good craic.
Magnus at 70 years old "pretending to be a 25 year old climbing for the first time"
Love how he said to an elderly man "Don't be a pussy" haha
No way an old fella has a but that tight hahahahah
I knew it was Magnus from the beginning.
This required more effort than I could muster to make this plausibly believable.
He looks younger
When an old man's beard starts falling off maybe there's something suspicious going on.
I wonder what through his head when he felt magnus finger strength and realized he’s coaching an alien
The shaking legs was too much.
the instructor is a legend, super humble and kind! way to go young man!👍👌
73 😆
Yeah this doesn't look like it was staged 😂😂
Magnus Midtbo pretends to be Count Olaf and tries to climb harder routes than orphans
no way you were taking cinematic videos of Sheffield. you cant make depravity look pretty
I think I know the instructor! Kieran, are you in the comments?
An old man wearing a weird hat and a scarf, coming into a climbing gym with a camera crew …. I am sorry but there is no way anybody is buying this.
I honestly don't know how anyone who has done rock climbing for a while can be fooled by these disguises, even with the makeup he still has the same facial structure.
Magnus is so much funnier than i expected! i am howling at this screaming on the wall
haahaha when Magnus falls and speaks in german, so funny
Sorry Magnus, men 73 år var å dra det i lengste laget 😅
“Seems like” sixty but, talks like 30, move like 30, blah, Blah…really?  NOPE
Ha! The instructor was brilliant. That was great fun. Nicely done Magnus 😆
8:30 Here Magnus looks like a little boy out in the cold snow peering through a window, watching other kids opening Christmas presents that he'll never have.
Could tell from the very first interaction that he knew, fast forwarded to the end and yep he knew the whole time
What a great sport he was, playing along
There are a lot of things to know someone is young but mostly  1. their voice 2. their hands are soft and not wrinkly  3. the language they use   I didn’t like the word choice he used it was clearly a more modern language, like he used “yup” or “yea” and it’s not really words that a 70 year old would use But that’s not the biggest giveaway because he also made the coach feel his hands and you can clearly see his young looking hands. but the biggest giveaway is his voice. He sounds so young there’s no way a 70 year old would sound like that.
"ungefähr 10 Meter ?" hahaha
Idk why it’s so entertaining to watch this in bed 😂 raining outside. Very relaxing
8:11 😂😂😂
I wonder if Magnus is underratedly funny. Just his face makes me crack up! He feels like the funny uncle to me.
scheiße verdammt!
No matter what, he looks like Magnus Midtbo 😂
Looks entirely the same. 🤣😂😅🤣😂
In Germany we would call this the bitch wall
that's the worst belayer ever, he gives likes 6 meter slack
🎉sauber!
"first you were a duck, then you were a chicken"😂😂😂
Well, it did not go as planed 😂
lol that's my home town, welcome to Sheffield!
can we all just agree at how good of an actor magnus is among all the other thing he does Edit: 23:39 wtf thos wrinkles are really convincing
it was so obviously magnus...if you've seen magnus.
Click regret in first frame.  I can't decide what sucked more--the make up "artist" fail, the dumb wardrobe choices that neither hide physique nor make any sense at all (for ANYONE who would choose to go climbing)  , the obvious lie about age, the weak acting, the lack of planning that makes this completely dumb and clearly not worth the time to watch through.   A prosthetic nose, at very least, would have helped that pathetic make-up fail.   seriously.
Oscar winning performance by Magnus and the coach
is this the old man from peaks of yore?
why make real content when fake garbage content works just as well ?🫠
Great  instructor!
You started slipping when he was talking… You dropped the accent a few times…
I know nothing about climbing but the instructor seems to be a really good and patient teacher.
nice pube beard
Would you like to buy your soul back?
Did anyone hear the coach say “don’t be a p**sy”?
I can tell he's not an old man from my phone with cracks in it.
As a German its very funny to hear you trying to speek German
And the invisible camera man strikes again.
He has the voice of a young teenage boy, how anyone falls for this is beyond me
too fake
They made Magnus look younger ;-)
I liked the "genau" inbeteween! Great research!
So the instructors dont find it suspicious or at least VERY ODD that a guy comes in stays climbing with a insulated coat,  scarf, and a hat? Something seems a bit strange with this video
Very original
Least convincing old man makeup i have EVER seen
is that sender one in the thumbnail
This pops back into my feed every couple months and old man Magnus staring into my SOUL is always a jumpscare 😂
His physique kind of gives him away I think.
Pretty sure the moment they saw the make-up, they knew it was a set up.  You can tell from 50 yards he's not a legit oldtimer.
I think especially on the 7c+ he was chalking a lot he started to get really suspicious, but yeah very fun video :D I think an old guy who hasnt climbed a lot might still have nice technique and skills and strength but the chalking just looked too much like you are in your everyday routine :D
You dont honestly think this fooled anyone do you? 😂😂😂
At least you know it's real when it barely works
If a cam crew, a scarf to cover the amateur makeup job, weird beard falling off as he sweats more and more, lumberjack looking shirt to hide hidden microphone and khakis pants doesn't yell you are being pranked I don't know what does..
Ahoy fisherman Barney
Almost makes me want to try climbing in a gym.
The fake sewing machine leg was hilarious.
Whenever i see a video where some athlete or whatever pretends to be an old man or woman, i always think the same:  You have to be either completely blind or completely stupid to believe it. It's impossible to recreate old people artificially.
Is this the foundry
did he say don't be a 😺😺to magnus😂😂
Climbing with a scarf on 😅😂
My wife is special makeup artist and works for films and opera and I can say that this is a pretty bad makeup. Beside of that, Magnus' voice isn't even close to the sound of an old man. That costume simply does not work, his appearance is just weird. The coach must have suspected that there is something wrong, especially when there is also a camera team.
How the hell he speaks german ????😂😂😂😂 isnt he from norway ?or something like that
come on the beard is terrible.
Where are the rest of climbers?
Reminds me the good ol' days of The Professor, good vid
MAGNUS'S OLD MAN CHARACTER WAS SO PRECIOUS HAHA
It would be a hazard to go up the wall wearing a thick & stiff jacket like that and a scarf lol they wouldn’t it obviously! Would have been a wicked cool joke if the guy was not in on it tho
Bit silly; did anyone actually buy this?
He doesn’t look like an old person. Just someone with makeup!
Whole time with the scarf on lmao
Whoever did you makeup should be fired
the dude gave up all pretense of being old after the climbs. i can see how it would be hard to act old while climbing but it's the recovery part, as he stood around after the climb. He looked like a 30 year old. The way he stood. Ram-straight. The non-labored breathing. He no longer was bent over, or hobbled around.
Nailed the personality of an old German dude.
I love it when the coach conveniently has a microphone ready and dosnt notice the camera man
Magnus has always seemed like a great coach...but this guy is fantastic as well. Great historical knowledge of the sport and very motivating!
Yeahhhhhh.... Dude knew.
What a good bloke
Hats doffed to the climbing coach for rumbling you. And great fun to watch.
these videos are so absolutely dire, as if no one knows that Magnus when he walks in...if people think these are genuine then they need their heads wobbled...
What a coach. Increadible man. You have to give probs to him 👍
xd
how funny would it be if the coach actually broke "character"... i feel like they all know who he is and just play along, no?
it's hard to know if i'm critiquing knowing you're in disguise or if this actually happened to me if i'd be fooled, but your disguise seems not realistic and you quivering legs while climbing seems unbelievable/super fake, but mayb the trainer isn't "bought"/going along with it ;)
The „SCHEIIIIßE“ at 8:23 😂
FUCK CENSORSHIP!!!.  stop censoring the dirty words. Stand up for human rights
Is it good for a first time climber making it on a 5.8 on a shorter wall and a 5.6 on a taller wall? (age 16)
he really actin like he as popular as mr.beast like bro you really aint
That was a trip...Great Fun Magnus!
So obviously a young fit man haha, sorry you’re just moving wrong and the makeup can’t hide how got you are. Old people don’t move like that 😅
Hmmm climbing with the over stuffed flannel, scarf and newsboys cap might make me look twice.
8:29 Man Looks Dumbfounded
Dude's beard is falling off. No old man wrinkles on his hands.
I don't think anyone was fooled.........not for 1 second........
wow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I like how his beard is just a patchwork of pubes like it was in team america lol
I feel like I'm watching Count Olaf try and spy on the kids in some weird new age version of Series of Unfortunate Events and I love it
The best climber in the world is Alain Robert  a legend!!!!!
So silly
the swearing in german was a nice touch
Fantastic instructor.  Loves his job.
I was almost bursting for laughter when he started screaming
How did none of your crew not just say “hold on you still look exactly the same just with a light beard let’s try a different disguise”
Want to know what’s truly impressive??? A actual old man doing this and not no gimmicky stunt.
Why
Love how he never breaks character, like when he mutters “Scheiße verdammt” when he falls
that coaches vibe was wonderful the whole time lol. you could tell he was having a blast with you.
You should have given your hands some wrinkles
Cameraman: no one can see me except him.
yeah how did no one reailise like the camra crew and all that?
When I see an old man in the climbing gym I don't think, "I don't think an old man should be doing this" I usually think, "oh wow that guy must be really experienced"
They allow you to wear a scarf during climbing??
12:58 SCHEISSE VERDAMMT IM CRYYIIINNGGG
hes pretty hard on you for an old man lol
Can't believe you've never been to rock town.... Need to come visit.
Lfmao
i climbed once without a leaser or rope and broke my legs Haha
Your acting is terrible.
I love how he obviously knew and just wanted to see some awesome climbs 😂
"like yogurt- you know yogurt?" IM DEAD, BRO ASKED IF HE KNOWS YOGURT
I just think the scarf was a bad idea but this was a really good video and you put fkn so much effort into faking this lol
Dude out here looking like Count Olaf... his beard is straight up falling off.
These videos are SO dumb. It's disrespectful to the teacher and it's also super obvious what's going on.....especially with a full-on camera crew in tow.
Captain Sham
Wow a rubber room
1:55
dude is merlin
cant wait to come back in 40 years for the real thing
You did the german accent very good!
Idk why but that instructor reminds me of Syndicate when he was younger
8:13 *LOL* he must have gotten some suspicion when he flew up the wall at the perceived "lightweight" of an "old man" that looks SMALLER than him lol! Magnus is as dense as a black hole in muscle mass, I can imagine he weighs 10-20 kilos more than the other guy despite being shorter and slim
every time they were talking to the camera man and pointing at him I felt like they were talking to me cause my name is josh LOL!
The make up is really not good, this guy figured it out before you even touched the wall and plays along..actually silently mocking their attempt at pranking him but he was having fun.  Magnus is a god climber but these impersonating attempts are very beginner like, would only fool a kid.
who is that 60yr old that did the 8b+ or was it cap when he recognized it was magnus?
Lookin like Prigozhin
If he'd come in on a walking stick it would have been awesome.
Im from Germany and i know those Grandpas haha 🤣
It's the worst disguise I've ever seen, but good try. 😂😂
That Irish bloke leading him is a bloody champion
You can tell the coach was super stoked that Magnus was there once he figured it out.
Love him actually saying german words like "Genau" what an actor
Wow!!!!!!
😅
I dont climb, but this was an absolute joy to watch.
Don't know how I ended up having a rock climbing video recommended to me, but here I am. Great work 🎉
I think it’s so hilarious that he’s playing as Frederick now 😂😂
As an Irisman, I don't think I'd trust any Irishman to guide me climbing. We're all to fucking easy going haha
I love how the coach is having an absolute blast at Magnus playing the old man.
So you're telling me an old man beat you, yet you stroke your ego in the beginning and in the title?   Couldn't even do the last red one
this gives the same energy of san pretending to be an old man and then busting out his dancing in front of that LA crowd
his beard started to fall off shit was so funnt
It’s kind of obvious but it’s prett funny
"How did you know?" The camera crew- 👁👄👁
"Less to live for" thought the instructor was gonna nope out of there, but bro laughed it off and took it like a champ
We learned Magnus needs to improve is climbing history😂
This coach is a legend
stop trying to desperately make money this sad way...
magnus, you are least convincig actor I've ever seen. these idiot show of videos get old after two.
at 19:22 he said something about alpine 7c+ on sights, wasn't that what happened in another video where he had black hair and played a beginner? i think alpine was the name of the place where they were
No wonder Bjorn doesnt like fredrick, his a bit of an ahole haha. Great vid magnus
Its soooooo obvious that the instructor knows you arent a real old man. "If you climbed during the blahblah era.." he knows you didnt climb then. Its nice he played along but obvious he knew something was up
Its soooooo obvious that the instructor knows you arent a real old man. "If you climbed during the blahblah era.." he knows you didnt climb then. Its nice he played along but obvious he knew something was up
this is so staged and fake and lame
i do not even know who you are
Bad grandpa would be proud
Idk, the instructor seems like he didn't really know but acted like he did. Something doesn't seem right, like he was insecure about what he thought so he ignored it but was in the back of his head.
That manly yell / grunt lol
Why would anyone climb wearing a jacket, scarf, and hat??
The shakey leg was perfect, you looked way more convincing as being old.
"First he went up like a duck and then like a chicken" I gonna remember that line the next time I use a flamethrower in a videogame
16:00 when the beard started to fall off i was loling XD
Take a few minutes and reapply your fake beard.
That shaking cracked me up, don't get surprised if you get head hunted for porn videos. 🤣🤣
He nailed the german accent too 😅
I would be able to tell the makeup is fake but I also don't climb. However as someone under estimated I can see how clothing fits someone or when clothing is lose and hiding how rough someone really is.
Gee another old man shows up with a camera crew to (The gym, the driving range, the baseball field, basketball court....)... can't imagine what's gonna happen next?
Whats the point! Look at me!
Why camara man is invisible always 😂😂😂
The old man makeup routine is tired.
I’m not super into climbing… but this video was gold lol
Instead of trying to find the one guy who doesnt use social media, you should have searched for the dumbest person in the UK, to believe you're actually old and not wearing makeup.
Guy knew after one look who it was. I mean he looks like a 30 yr old dressed up as an old person.
Climbing bores me.
I like the instructor.
The coach is great and the man and the gentleman is amazing climbing but we all make sounds while climbing and free climbing, even more screams. Great video
I come from a lawless part of social media where we get used to call this 'fake and gay' as in 'homosexual and fabricated'.  In no way I want to throw shade on any sexuality as I am a gay man myself.
He had the body and hands and ears of a younger man  and his make up would have been a dead givaway.
An average man starts to lose strength around 50, so trying to say you are 70 is far fetch and only a young person would believe your story.  I am over 55 and I would never be able to do what I did in my 40's.  The best target to dress up as is a college kid.  You would never fool an older person.
any idiot could spot that shit disguise from a mile away
The hands are a givaway.
cameraman invisible 😳
So a professional climber came to town for an exhibition, he was supposed to climb the face of the church. So he tried to climb and no he couldn't do it, and out of the audience a voice was heard saying he would like to try the climb and so this local did. Climbing all the way to the top of the bell tower with no problem. Told by my dad, an eye witness, may he rest in peace.
it would a much better video if it was actually an old guy doing it
I love it!
11:00 the moment he knew he was bullshitting I would have thought he’d say he was 60.
him pretending to elvis leg was crackin me up
pro climber..like...who cares about that
73? What year were you born?
bro thinks he kratos
technique Trump's strength
That scarf is ridiculous
Thanks for the video old man! Good job!
Why is this a thing now? Pretending to be a old man climbing or pretending to be a rookie weightlifter.. its like the strippers in the club, look at me please!!
Jesus saves
This feels highly staged with the attendant, but it's still cool to see him climb like a crazy person
Germans favourite humour
What a tired format upon which this clip is based.  Climbing in a cap and a scarf.  Nonsense.
waiting for magnus to do sex replacement therapy and take estrogen for 2 years to pull of a prank
Don't be a pussy he said, that's great
You don’t look old
Hate to tell you but we climbed boulders in the 70s and 80s we just didn't call it bouldering.
This instructor loves his job😂
I just found your channel and you look like Van Gogh 😂
So staged.
Good luck getting the Irish kid. They have the best sense of humor to just keep going with it and so many encouraging Irish phrases to drop in this situation. "Go on, then!"
Your hands were a dead giveaway. A persons age is always apparent on the hands.
Waaahh hahahahahaha good one
When your Old you have less to live for. That had me dying 😂 dude just made it sound soo casual
This is the worst disguise I've ever seen. His fake beard is falling off. Dude has known this whole time
There’s no way they bought that guy was 73 😂 he sounds far younger, ears too small, skin is too firm and thick, etc. they also should have done something to age the appearance of his hands…one can usually guess a persons age pretty accurately by looking at their hands and ears.
Hard to hide a young neck and hands. The sun is mean to skin.
What’s  the  point?
The instructor knew something was up.  And when he said 73 for his age,  I was like “C’mon now!”   Should’ve said something like 61.  And that he used to be a mason,  which would explain his obviously good physique.
hahah looks shit
Staged. Delete this garbage.
damn, i was listening at 15:26 without video and it was special...
That thumbnail reminded me of Jim Carrey's Count Olaf lmao
Climbing instructor literally thinks he discovered a super human 😅
XD
I learned to climb there lol
It feels like its faked. The whole setup, the camera and so on.
Man these are getting old.
Honestly... the spotter guy is a great hype man
"We're looking for a 20-year-old that doesn't use social media..."   lol  Good luck
This is very silly
Next step... Prosthetics and a fat suit.
Is a pro climber someone who makes a living from climbing?
After meeting an 80 year old guy in the gym who’s still in great shape and seeing another old guy doing weighted pull ups, I’ve learned to never underestimate old people
I couldn't watch much this seemed really dumb
Hmmm, all the grandpas going past me on the mountain trails while I'm catching my breath in Japan must have been young fit people in disguise.
I don't believe that nobody twigged, the disguise was garbage
The hat. Where can I get one.
Hello from Mullingar - what a great trainer!!
Such a bad fake ... just poor and embarassing
did the trainer notice the cameraperson?
Mexican at 61 did it haha but not this guy
Instructor: C'mon dont be a p..... Magnus: Beast mode ON.. Uaaaarrrrrrggghhhhhhhh.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The oldest climber I ever climbed with was a 80 year old woman from the British mountaineering club - the mid 1990s. She climbed harder than me, was fearless, and pushed my limits as a second when she climbed past the length of the belay rope, requiring addition of every sling, and line I had within reach in my kit. On a route that was definitely not suited to both of us off the ground.  Then after my own heart, she down climbed to her previous clip point 35m below her top out, before abseiling off.  This was adventure climbing, and she had chosen a route none have repeated to this day.
Magnus, your acting skills are AWESOME once again! I had a blast watching and listening to you guys. Also the coach is full of positive energie - really nice!  And as someone who was born in Germany, I congratulate you to your spot on german accent, with the right placed and sounding german word snippets!  Haha, awesome!
He talked too quick to be old  ..and he used climbing terms an amateur wouldn't know   ..unconvincing oldness
🥱
This was the worst attempt at a disguise by fat
Why doesn't he have old mans hands?  Erm HELLO!
22:39 If I had to guess, it was the voice, to me it seemed like the voice sounded too young
He looks like Michael Reeves but 50 years older
Who climbs in a jacket and scarf?
youngest looking old man ever... and what a sweet child voice too
73 was a bit generous i would have went with maybe early 60s
First you were a duck, than you were a chicken
I don't know this guy off of his character from this episode so I don't know his actual skill level or his actual personality.
Only an out of touch with reality climber would think that an average person would see a geriatric climbing  and think that was perfectly normal. 73 year olds aren’t that strong. And those hands don’t have the skin of a 73 year old.
next time, try to hide your young man posture by adding something in the front of your stomach, also your hands and voice were giving you away a little, im surprised you werent immediately figured out ! It made me think it was staged at some points , it must be hard to change ur voice the whole time, and have something in the front of your stomach and to hide ur hands as well as possible and do a slow step instead but it wouldve gotten a greater response ! i look forward to your next videos !
It’s probably hard to make yourself look like a rookie
he still looks 100% the same lmao also the goofy outfit and tight pants you shouldve picked something that hides his legs, a 70 y/o woulve needed a wheelchair after 10:28 but still entertaining video and nice coach
I think the makeup crew went a little to much. It’s a little obvious that your a young guy. Plus your hands look very young.
"At first you were a duck, and then you were a chicken" 😂
Fun video, but it only takes a barely-observant person about 10 seconds to spot something like that.  Think of the "uncanny valley" people talk about when the eyes of a CGI character are off JUSSSSST a smidge.  Nevertheless, all in fun... good job.
Bro 😂
Lyyyyyyyyser Mr Midtbø laaaang vei!
how much German can you talk?
i really enjoyed this video, what a pleasure and i laughed so much on the end. nice guy this "young" boy, thanks for this content, really good ;)
06:03 "Genau". All you really need to know to impersonate a German 🤣🤣🤣
The "Genau" got me Hahahah
was it really that hard to put a little make up on his neck too so he doesn't have to climb with that stupid old man shit on his neck?
amazing ahahaha. I think the biggest give away was your voice. The accent was perfect but sometimes you forgot to sound like an old dude  also the screaming killed me ahahahaah
Absolute carnage
ngl the disguise kinda reminded me of Michael Reeves, like an elderly version of him xD
0:40 looks like a video game
The coach is amazing, even as someone who doesn't climb, I can tell he's amazing and his positivity would be really helpful for someone to learn/improve.
dd
Your voice, body language, overall attitude and posture are all dead giveaways.  Also like a comment said earlier the hands.  Edit: also that type of 70 year old man image is antiquated (pun intended).  Remember this person was supposed to be born born in the 50's in America/Europe.  Won't find many dressed like that, you'd need to go older 😐  Makeup alone can only carry you so far unless you're with a moron
I went to this specific climbing place. I am french but my grandparents live in sheffield. It's one of the tallest in the region if I remember well.
15 minutes into this his beard looks like something out of the film "Team America" lmao
The instructor was so nice and patient I would like to take a class with him
73ys old LOL... okay...
Your hands they still look young, little tip make your hands old too😊
This is one of the most team rocket disguises ive ever seen.
IF YOURE NOT FALLING YOURE NOT TRYING ! good words
The fact that he's wearing a thick plaid and scarf is suspicious to begin with
Love how he didn't keep his body too close to the wall to keep up the illusion
You're a damn legend. I loved to climb anything as a kid. I'm overweight now, but I know what its like to be in great shape. Makes me want to take up climbing to feel like a kid again. Maybe I will if there's something in my area. Being overweight just means a better workout lul.
This instructor reminds me of a young Linus Sebastian for some reason.
This is so fake!😂
A man in scarf and hat walks into the gym, pretends he is noob, and goes straight forward to lead climbing. And somehow the instructor knew something was up... Could a camera man be a hint?
Love the videos Magnus.. next time try doing the easy ones and then say “ can I try a very hard one to see if I can do it” then just send it on the walls and smash it
Terrible job belaying!
That was really cute, the employee was a great sport
He doesn't look like an actual old man though...
Were they not suspicious of the cameras???
warum trägt der alte mann einen schal in der sporthalle 🤣🤣🤣
After the Fall at 15:45 you can see his beard is coming of at his left hand side :D  Edit: 2 seconds later they notice it as well... I'm dead xx
The boyish scream then the accent is just PUREGOLD 😂
he was a good sport lolll
back in my day, climbing was easier because gravity hadn't been invented yet...
Does magnus acctually know german or just a few words? Because his pronounciation is pretty good and
Funny video, but not a chance in hell he lets you make those climbs if he thinks you are 73.
Now I want to see a real old German man try rock climbing
2:53 "Do you know what an autobile is?" "Yes, we rode in one on the way here"
Who the hell believes that beard is real?
Whoever did the makeup and beard needs to be fired. Looks pretty unconvincing
There’s no way the couch didn’t know.
Falls: Scheiße verdammt
wtf would an old man even be dressed like that
I feel like the makeup isn’t that good.. He doesn’t look like an old man or sound like one lol… The Instructor must have been like WTF is going on here
Message for you tube. Keep it up with the constant advertising. You’ve exceeded your polite limits. I’d be less pissed if you paid your creators. Cat videos should not be equated with, for instance, Obsolete Oddities, whose creators craft what are most accurately called short films. It’s not a difficult concept. You are keeping too much money for your investors and not enough for the people who actually make the site what it is.
This is maybe your best performance yet Edit: Okay guess not
I predict that one day “old face” will be as offensive as black face.
Excellent video… These instructors are inspiring…Magnus  looks like Spider-Man when he makes that jump thing…
As a German I loved the „scheiße verdammt“ and other german expressions. 😂 Fun to watch!
20:19 epic
Looks like Michael reeves pretending to be an old dude
His beard trying to hold on to his face for dear life. 😂
First time I've ever seen a belayer get belayed despite casual rock climbing experience. Wasn't expecting him to go shooting up but it does make obvious sense. I feel like an idiot.
Dude looks like JonTron in makeup in that makeup
We call this the 😺 wall 😂
He still looks like magnus though lol
Kieran was a great sport, and you could tell he knew something was up, esp when he offered the 7c. Great video Magnus - I love these.
He basically pranked the prankers
1st u r a duck then u r a chicken hhhhh
i _love_ how the instructor isn't afraid to criticise or question magnus. something we need more of
23:10 holf crap, the snap into two climbers talking about a route out of a original instructor noob client relationship is crazy
20:57 that tongue in cheek of your instructor.. he knows your about to crush this route
hey magnus, your acting aint half bad!
finding my way back to you after a couple years.. your video premise have gotten even better
Isn't Otto Bilet the African guy Russel Peters talks about?
I would spot you in a heartbeat.  Your outfit, too heavy on the detail, is trying to hard to deceive.
16:40 this is the moment the british instructor knew this whole thing was weird. When he refused to drink hot beverages.
He didn't really put on an old man voice or anything I would have assumed undercover boss or something being up just on that alone I only know the guy from some Nick Symonns videos so would only recognize him off that though. I love climbing as a kid beat an instructors time up a 50ft wall in France - would love to climb again sometime
pesima caracterizacion de ninguna manera parece un hombre de más de 40 años
I don’t know how Kieran didn’t know something was up, that scarf never comes off 😂
”whyre u laughing” 😹
Doing a convincing old mans makeup is harder than climbing K2 at wintertime. It becomes suspicious real fast. Better just wear glasses, color the hair and hope for the best.
As a German, I rly enjoyed his French accent.
You know the gig's up when the trainer gets this stupid grin on his face. But it looked fun pushing on and waiting for the other person to admit the truth.
Hahaha, amazing. Try with more old people with you climbing, maybe you can throw the scent off
You actually look like the action lab😮
You missed an opportunity to be 69 years old
You didnt even change ur voice lol, its like you tried to look like a grandpa but didnt even try to do anything else to seem older lol
It was a valiant effort, but surely a full scarf and coat plus obviously jacked legs showing through the dress pants sort of gives it away 😂 at some point it becomes really hard to hide talent like that 🔥
omg tis ye olde magnus again
Come on...
W
I realised it's fake. I mean, whose trainer let to climb in scarf and cap?
That french accent, when you're german :))))
The “before you die” comment towards the end had me rolling 😂
This Trainer is Gold. He just take you and you "shown" abilities as a given while still encouraging you. Also he's positive all the way through, while still 110% professional eg. testing your finger strenght, rope skills and doesn't get sold on "my arms are weak" BS ;-). Heck, I think he could teach me climbing. And I'm scared of hights.  And I really likes how he teases you at about minute 20, that the Spanish guy might actually be better than you - not sure if he realized at that moment - but still he's still you best friend while also your drill instructor. Also your actor skills might match your climb abilities.
Goal: Old man Result: Burn victim
You can tell he knew immediately lol
Shouldn't have said 73 mate, should've said 60 or 58
Magnus, you can’t not look fit and professional no matter the make up. 😅
He should pretend to not know things lol
The camera man has a stack of invisible positions
Climbing with a fking scarf and a hat. Its too obvious.
In my career, I want to be a college professor. My dream is to be as positive, knowledgeable and instructive as the coach in this video ❤❤
Sender One thumbnail lol why is that there?
How can anyone be fooled by him its so obviously a disguise i think these videos are staged although i still love them 😂
French/German accent lol
Who doesn't like Friedrich?
“First you were a duck then you were a chicken” genuinely made me laugh so hard 🤣🤣🤣🤣
loved it !! new sub here  I'm going to have to get back into climbing, as an old ish man haha, it's good fun.
I’ve been climbing and sailing for awhile. I use the figure eight to tie in while climbing and the bowline is my goto knot on the boats. If you truly value your life stick with the figure eight. Follow thru, it’s fool proof. The bowline is a great knot but it’s definitely not what I would consider a life rated in all situations knot, I’ve seen it come apart to many times to bet my life on it every time
wait so the old guy with glasses is magnus ( best climber from norway) ?
He's gotta be sweating through that coat and scarf 😆
This coach is pretty cool!
Obviously the world needs a video of Magnus trying some of Johnny Dawes and other UK classic gritstone routes - would love to see him try The New Statesman and Gaia (on a top rope, of course!)
This is so cool. When the instructor encourages Magnus onto the 8b+ we can all understand what he’s about - he knows he has a world class climber on belay and wants to enjoy the spectacle of a world class climber on-sighting the hardest moves. I know this wall. 8b+ on this short wall is super bouldery, with tough clips.
Damn. Now I feel like the old man. I used train at this gym, The Foundry, in the first few years after it opened. It was cutting edge when it opened and all the hardcore locals trained there. It has a great woodie and the ‘Furnace’ lead walll probably still is perfect training for the local limestone, only a slight overhang, slippy, very short and technical.
Isn’t it weird how some people treat old people like children?
12:58 "Scheise verdammt"
The foot shakes were a bit much lol
Pretty chilled out coach! Excellent that he went through with the prank 😅
1) I love the couch. So nice and supportive and with great knowledge. You are doing great job, sir! 2) Magnus clothing is too suspicious. I understand why it has to be this type of clothing. But still, too suspicious :D.
Pro climber gets fooled into hard climbing. Kieran made Magnus work for this video lol.
The fatigue shakes 😂
As a German, your role as a German pensioner from the Alps seems very familiar to me^^ you can even speak fluent "denglisch" ( German and English combined).
Having a piece of beard just hanging in a clump off your chin is as obvious as a moustache half fallen off. Like who is blind enough to not know?
Good acting. Leg shaking and everything lol
Your hands are to young
Who would let a guy wear a scarf that could strangle him during a fall?
The fake sewing machine leg might give away the game.
😂😂😂 the shaking legs is the best 😂😂😂
6:05 GENAU? Wait so Magnus actually speaks German??
If THAT Magnus is 73…looks 73, then I’m 93 😢
Seems like he knew from the start. 😂
Old men can't be trusted anymore
My toxic trait thinking I could dothis
The age "73" BAHAHHAH
How fake is this? Very.
LOL when he sticks his leg out up there...
Your voice, your shape, your hands... everything about you is screaming : I'm a young man disguised as an old person. Surely noone bought it
11:55 hes onto you
He certainly didn't notice that the beard was coming loose.
Lol his beard standing in all directions 😂
Man these videos make me want to try 😮
Bored with the fakery
this coach is a G
He should've worn gloves, or at least stained oil spots. His hands are obviously youthful.
Excellent 😂
"oo a cheeky knee.. good to see" might be the funniest line of any video i've seen the coach was funny as anything,
Can someone translate "taking some massive wangers" to American for me?
The camera man is invisible😂
Dude i lost it when he started yelling 😂
Lmao. The real comedy is Magnus being disappointed that his prank isn't working and someone finds out. He needs to climb around non instructors lol
This just goes to show you that old people can do anything if they're actually young people in disguise.
small ears for 73 years old man :D
No offence, you are very strong, but this just screams for attention; i get you are doing it for the views and ergo the money, but still, sad to see
"First you were a duck, then you were a chicken" 🥹🥹 He's so adorable
You're beard was shit
Coach: That’s it! Come On! Yeah! *repeats 30 times*
I think the giveaway was you wouldn't climb with a hat and scarf.
You asked how he could tell... I've never seen a beard look so fake lol
He knew right away. Climbs with jacket, scarf, hat still on... gotta be a disguise. Accent or not, they know his voice, too.
Your German accent is so damn convincing👀
I'm from Sheffield, and our climbing gyms have at least one old man per day who can somehow cling like spiders to the most ridiculous inclines. Props to them ❤
I wish we had something like this where I live . Of course we do have the southern Appalachians but I'd like somewhere to practice first so I don't obliterate myself 🤣
The beard just falling off
rock climbing is probably the worlds´most boring sport to watch....I can´t even get past 1 minute of this video to see the final reveal.
Honestly I would recognize him instantly and the facial hair is just disgusting...
“Pretend like you have some yogurt on your finger so just shake that yogurt off” proceeds to scream in old German man
He obviously told you he knew multiple times. You think he would talk like that to any client? Lol
There’s no way they’d let someone climb with a scarf on.
That’s an extremely unconvincing “old man”.
I would've called you Count Olaf
This has to be the worst disguise ever
Had the “sewing machine leg” going and everything.  Very funny, “3hours of makeup”
This is very cool LMAO
73 lol
He knows he's being scammed ... because of the camera ... and they guy's build. Honestly, who falls for these bullshirt videos?
Are there old mountain climbers or do they eliminate themselves before becoming old?
Damn he's so good at looking shaky and unsure at first
First,love the quivering legs during the first climbs. But also love the excitement you brought to this man’s day, thinking he was working with an exceptional older gent.
Excellent prank. 😂 Magnus, you have to work on your voice tone because it is quite characteristic for many by now. You dialect was good, but use more of it. And use more baggy pants next time to camouflage your fitness level. Otherwise, excellent.
You Madmag! HahahaI This is hilarious!!!!
you looks like Sun Wukong 😂
oof that makeup wasnt it lol. If they couldnt tell it was bs they were high as a kite.
I mean c'mon, who wouldn't tell him to take off his hat and scarf...
Thought this was Jim Carrey from that movie. You know the one
He’s way too recognizable
Your ripped pairs of legs gave your disguise away from a mile away, Magnus!
RIP Makeup
I love this coach ❤😂 “BEAST” 😂😂👍 He had a blast at work that day!
😂❤❤🎉
This reminds me of the famous Seattle's Pike Place Market Gum Wall...super-sized!
I love how he just goes straight from 6c+ to 7c+ 😂
The feet shaking, twisting and turning omg that's so hilarious XD
I don’t even climb but I loved this video
but pro climber didnt complete the hardest route
I was about to comment.. “damn this old man can do better than me” at 10:16 but then I remembered what I was watching 😅
10:50 "but when you're old you've got less to live for" Then magnus's non verbal response and coach tryna to change the subject, best part of the vid for sure
This is why I love bouldering :) the community is just so awesome 😂
Fricken love the shaking legs and the yells.
I love this coach!!!
lmao
Sometimes it's funnier when they know than when they don't. New sub!
I know nothing about climbing (or anything really), but I really enjoyed this.
That was a nice prank
The makeup is not convincing
5:21 Frederick had a flashback to the 60's ngl
Hat
Scarf
Old man should remove some clothing
What if he just crushed it, when he was falling down his beard came off and looks  him dead in the eyes and goes 'I feel young again'
I honestly kept forgetting that Frederick wasn't a real old man and it made me sad each time I remember the whole point of the video
Young hands defeats all of the face makup, this is so sketched
Unfortunately, he looks like someone in old man makeup. Zero chance this dude actually believe he is old.
Try wearing baggy sweatpants next time. You can clearly see your legs are very fit through those pants which makes it harder to fool someone.
Bro really forgot to do the old voice
Awesome video! 👍👍
People boldered 30 years ago what the hell. I was climbing a little in the 80s and we were bouldering
Lol he knew it was you from the start, the disguise wasn't that good man.
Great work on this vid. :)
That big fall was terrifying
well that was a waste of my time. lol
Weve all seen pro athletes dress as old men and do crazy stuff. What we havent seen yet is an old man do some crazy athletic stuff
He knew within 1 minute something was up
Pretending to be an old man is aid
It's amazing how much he knew about climbing.
Worst fake beard I've ever seen lmao
heartwarming
Massive props to the coach!!! SOO encouraging and sweet
Y tho
I like how are used to climb these as a kid and it was so easy no apparently full grown adults do this it’s literally not even that hard as long as you know how to get good grip on your fingertips
Yooo Ripon
Might've pushed it with 73, the disguise was imo worth about 61 at most. Still great fun.
Gotta get the old man full head mask next time, ur face is too distinctive
You like the price is right mountain climber!
Ok. Not the best try in terms of understanding the people you guys prank are not retarded, but still was very fun. When he said he was 73 though... That was poor xD
I prefer other vids of Magnus, because I don't climb and can't even if I tried due to health reasons, but I genuinely hope that this climbing gym and especially this coach had more visitors since this video. It was a light hearted, pure enjoyment.
Man how hard it must be to act like you are not a high level climber haha. Great video per usual.
Next time you have to get a heart attack for like, 5 seconds
21:04 : You always nail the music integration. I love the effort and attention for detail 👍
Next time go as a woman ;)
"thats the knot we used when we climbed the eagle's nest.."
its not sus at all he is wearing a hat and a scarf lol
Magnus is just a beast
Its so funny seeing him pretending his leg is shaking when hes climbing the pink wall like an old man lol XD
Magnus Silente
Should have told him 62. You Dont have the voice for a 70+ year old haha. Needs more rasp
Great video, man! You should definitely continue this trend of disguising yourself - very entertaining. You might want to take some acting classes though haha.
You can see and hear his trying his hardest to lie😅😂 and i love how his coach is having fun hahahahahaha
That was a great job, with the legs shaking and small mistakes. Very convincing, great vid.
Because old men climb with winter jackets, hats, scarfs 😂
Going to have to step it up on the disguises.  Teenage bikini model might be a little sneakier.  At least until he climbs a bare section of overhang just using the mounting holes.
your new video where you pretend to be an old man on muscle beach, that makeup would work. Couldn't recognize you at all.
HEY WAIT PLEASE i want to get your atention please give this even a small chance as a grain of sand alright just please it will only take you i dont know lets say 5 minutes and trust me it might be the most important message you will hear ALL day❤️❤️ Repent to God before its too late i know this message keeps on apearing every now and then but it doesn't get atention or at least enough atention people wake up and stop living in sin and in worldly toughts and doings its not only afecting your relationship with Jesus our Savior but its afecting you please listen to me give it a try im a very direct person and the truth is many of our friends loved ones known ones and even strangers!! WILL GO TO HELL!! It hurts me just to write this fact and that they will go there now to cut to the chase if you want to live for THE truth and THE Lord you need to repent. Repent? Right now wherever you are get on your knees if you can and shut your hands closed together and start praying this either with your mouth or in your head: Father God i know that for ME and my family and my enemies and my neighbours you have sent your one and only beloved Son Jesus Christ to live a perfect and sinles life and to die on the cross for all of our sins and to be raised by You on the 3rd day. Father God i admit with my mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and i will let him in my heart and i admit that i have sinned and i have done wrong by you. We don't deserve You Lord but You died for us so that trough You we may get to heaven. Father Jesus we pray that you help us with our daily strugles and most importantly help us not to sin and be free of our sins and live a new life in Your name. In Jesus name amen.❤️ Now i think that should be a great enough prayer and if you need any tips any help first go to God and Jesus and ask them for directions then either come here and ask me to help you or go on youtube and search david lynn i think is his name hes a very wise and powerful sharer of the gospel even better if you have tik tok go search davidpurther he in my opinion is a very strong person in God and to be completely honest he was the one that saved me him and some more if you want more accounts like brother David ask me and if i will see your request ill try my best to answer  As always may God bless you and give you a blessed new year AMEN AMEN :) ❤️✝️ Jesus 🔛🔝🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
Magnus is so full of himself. No one knows who you are. You're not Alex honnold
The "before you die" part had me dying lmao
massive WANKERS 😂😂
This instructor knows his shit and is a cool guy! I like him!
Soo funny 🔥🤣😂
haha he still looks like magnus xd
My grandfather was climbing in the lake district in the U.K up until his death when he was 81 (from natural causes). Maybe the oldest rockclimber in the U.K, and he dressed a bit like Magnus is dressed here. You can read his obituary  in the independant newspaper if you google 'sydney thompson independent obituary climber'
Is no one gonna talk about him not using chalk for the first 16 mins of the vid💀
bro you're not fooling anyone lol
I literally thought this was a recap video of a movie bc the title and thumbnail
'You don't look that different' haha brilliant
Magnus is a genius actor
double bowline knot in beginning, then at 7:20 he's just using a figure 8. yea, i would have noticed that standing there too
Plot twist, the instructor pretended not having social medias just to have a chance to be with Magnus. Then after meeting him went all over his social medias? ;-)
This guy has NO IDEA!  Totally just coming back each time like, "I want to see how far this old man can go!"
Jesus...these 'pretends to be old man' youtube vids are played the fuck out.  Come on man....
I love this series so much! Keep it up!
I think Tim Robinson may have out done you on this one.
I bet he was screaming to warn the rope holder about his coming fall after his scary drop off
That beard is uh...
They didn't put any makeup/effects on the back of his hands or on his neck; anyone who knows how aging works would know this man is young as hell ;P
Beard was falling off halfway through the vid
scarf and hands are a dead giveaway
He looks like a 20 year old with a fake beard
The guy in the video goes to my gym in awsome walls in cork 🇮🇪
That French accent 😂😂
He should have shown up wearing full scuba gear and been all like, "I normally go the other way, but I've been curious about all the fuss"
Irish people, best people on the planet!
Somehow Kieran pretending not to know was more entertaining than if he had actually been fooled and surprised
😂😂😂😂😂
That's what you do when you're a hard mountain man, you onsight 7c+ 😂😂
So Funny video 😂
I’ve never even been climbing, but this is still entertaining as hell
You didn't even look old though
i LOVE these videos, hope they never stop getting released <3
no.
An autobelayer strap cut loose at OAKA climbing center in Athens, Greece, almost killing the person. The system was of the highest quality, brand new. Do not remember the brand. Be aware.
I fucking love this coach with all of by being
Why would the cameraman film from directly below him?? Horrible shot.
he knew immediately, you can tell by his face.
Now we need an old man pretending he is a pro climber and trying out all the easiest routes video to complete these series.
I think the beard falling halfway off probably gave away that he was in makeup 😂
Kieran has the most magnetic energy oh my goodness I just wanna hang out with that guy, what an awesome vibe
I would rather see real people at various ages, not this fake shtick. Maybe biased, but my local gym has many legends, and former pros climbing 5.13 into their 60's, while also having had - gasp - real professions not related to climbing! Too bad YouTube fosters vanity, self-absorbed posers, and fifteen seconds of fleeting fame, rather than the gregarious, welcoming atmosphere that doesn't care whether your numbers are impressive. The unique feature of indoor gyms should be that a 5.8 newbie can trade belays with a former world champion and not be intimidated, or dismissed because they aren't sending cutting edge routes with their new tatts flexing.
the german has no anger :P and its verdammte scheiße! not scheiße verdammte
Best thing about this is how great the coach was on the early climbs, and he was so encouraging. As a genuinely old fogey, it makes me think I maybe should give it a try after a 30 year “break”…
Magness faking the sewing machine leg is funny
I'm a German myself and you absolutly smashed the accent. Great video and funny idea.
As soon as he keeps the scarf on I would know shits about to go down
I find it so funny and entertaining watching Magnus get better and better😂 I especially loved the music that went with his epic moves at the end
Loved the Pink Panther...ish music!
Some of the best days of my childhood. Running around my town skating everywhere, laughing and falling all over the place with my friends. Something about the feeling of getting back up to try it again.
🌱
my guy has the lock of the carabiner on the wrong side, skill issue ig. shouldnt coach if he doesnt know basics
Magnus is copying Anatoly LOL
pretty obvious, he has very young hands, no wrinkles
Hvor varmt var dette? 😂 How hot was it? 😂
You should do this but instead of someone directly filming you you can haver them go into the gym like if they are filming themselves, but are actually secretly filming you. This way you don't tip off the instructor.  great video btw
this guy can teach old dog new tricks
His beard was completely coming apart lol
Umm that beard looks fake
He hasnt got an old voice though
10:20 I'm loving the disco legs 🤣
3 hours of makeup and still looks exactly like Magnus.
This old man is such a quick learner, I bet he used to be pretty athletic back in the day
so, magnus is an amazing actor??
he's obviously clocked in 2 seconds just like the last ones. but it's still super fun to watch 2 guys who could wayy outclimb me playing along with it
I don’t think he fooled anyone.
This guy needs to be an actor 😂
Man ur amazing.. ur fan from Kuwait
Nah, you just look like the avarage 30 year old who isn't an influencer.
6:57 he knows, and he's joking about it - it is hilarious
That Team America beard man...
Doesn’t matter how you look. If you don’t move like an old person, the jig is up. I refuse to believe this coach didn’t instantly know this was a ruse, but great video anyway!
He should have worn lose pants, we can see all his leg muscles 😅
Could of been good but he knew from the start what was going on
"How could you tell"? I dont know..maybe your weird looking makeup and crappy fake patchy beard. Its obvious.
Тренер молодец!!!
A little bit guttered that you came to my local gym and I haven't been in a while to see you 😅 would have been an honour
Count olaf taking up but another disguise
the fact that nobody found it weird for a man to be climbing with a scarf and a hat on 😂
Dang, they weren't kidding with the whole "British people are just constantly sarcastic" stereotype lol, even when it was obvious he knew, he was still just dropping the ultra-sarcasm every other line lol like "suuuuuureee, you can do this 7c+ as a 73 year old man, suuuurrree." was really funny tbh.
Magnus your young hands give you away. I’m so glad you found this coach.
The more that time went on the more he was trying to suppress laughter. He knew he was being trolled. Kudos to him for humouring you for so long though.
Your German mannerisms and the few small words were super legit ahaha!
This dude is such a clown lmao
I love how much fun the instructor was having 😆
Of course he knew, Magnus is tying his knots while looking him in the eye and still looks jacked in his flannel.
Wow how did you age so quickly!
he is definitely irish with his kindness and his accent
This coach is an amazing lad. Happiness himself
These vids are bloody hilarious! The disguise was pretty shit though. Looked good from afar, but up close it just looked too fake. Props to the coach for being an awesome guy!
"you dont look that different" lmao
Honestly these videos are not good. Im gonna say it. It seems like youre just doing it for the views/algo and noone actually believes that anyone falls for these "disguises". It cheapens your channel thats otherwise very high quality dude.
Next time try coming as a black man
The intro is basically what happened when my dad who used climb in the 70s came to the indoor gym at age 65. Brought in a figure 8 belay device and didn't know how to use an ATC let alone a grigri 😂
I'm amazed he was fine with you wearing the scarf. You'd think that wouldn't be something you want to get caught anywhere.
I am not even a rock climber and sadly have never climbed before, but I can't stop binging your videos! xD
God resisteth the proud he giveth grace (: that which is not deserved and yet given anyway,) to the humble.  Love Jesus, read the KJV and pray for wisdom, seek God and his sweet amazing grace. John 15:13 "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." James 3:16 "For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.” Every sin that there is always requires a little uncaring selfishness to accomplish" Matthew 4:17 "From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Repent: to change your mind, to change your ways, to believe in Jesus and what he said, to ask for forgiveness. Note when someone asks for forgiveness at each point in the past they did something wrong they wish they did the right thing
Yellow t-shirt guy's reactions are faker than my gf's orgasms.
Can't wait for this to be an on going series, when eventually Magnus's disguises will get more and more elaborate as time goes on😅
Ive been playing guitar and bass for over a decade.  And to try and purposely play "bad" or sound like a beginner, is extremely hard.  To go against conditioning and muslce memory, is alot more difficult than it seems.   I imagine it must be the same way for Magnus when he has to try and climb like a beginner😅  Every fiber of his being is struggling, as he tries to look like a noob haha.
the leg shakes xDDDDD
those legs shakes when he's climbing the pinks... hahaha
Because old people are useless and can't do nuttin'...
Magnus: dont do this in the netherlands unless you actualy speak the language (in this case german). High chance the dutch person will start talking that language to you :D This was a great one, well done! (even the sheaky leg! awesome!)
The fake facial hair looks as though someone glued pubes to his face. It's the furthest thing from believable. 🤣
When you are at a skill level like Magnus, it is extremely hard to pretend to be a beginner. The accent was pretty good too. Sounded very Austrian.
Very good video, thanks for sharing 🙂
Nice
Nice
Very interesting
bien
unfortunately what you forgot to add in the makeup department was the hands and neck... older people tend to have looser looking skin on the extremities and neck... either way it was pretty funny to watch magnus act like an old man. edit: btw how long do you think it took to remove all of it off?
if all teachers had such passion....
This should be a movie
Nice one
Wait up, you did all that with no chalk? Holy crap this young guy is having you for one too!
classic asf dude magnus you have got it man!
:))
Love these videos
You can tell by how much the instructor was smiling he knows what's going on. He is having trouble containing himself lol
GF
Nice
r we sure about wearing the hat and scarf wont be more suspicious? loll
He definately knew right from the start you can tell by the way he was holding back the grin right at the start
He really climbs in that fit?
Magnus... it's obvious. Come on. No disrespect. I'd read you first minute... so good climbing video would be getting every single popular young folk on the wall with you. Like... the rest of storror.  As Pete did with Bob. Anyone out there doing strength vids cause... you're above and beyond. Hope the hustle keeps you viable, always.
Do a fat suit next.
I love this coach. Not only is he a sweet man and a good sport, but he also sounds like a really good coach, as well.
This coach was amazing. He`s so exited and engaged, I myself wat to climb now
I love how you confidently assume he doesn't know the difference between German and Norwegian. 🤣
This isnt fake at all not one bit.
Hidden camera?
I'd love to see a video with an actual old boulderer crushing it
The shaky leg got me GOOD 😂
Osm old man
Thank you for bleeping the gendered slurs the instructor kept saying.
Cameraman: "When you're old you've got less to live for" Coach: "I suppose yeh, less to live for" 🤣🤣
You look like Aaron danger when the jackals guys glued pubes to his face 🤣
I hope dude looked at that beard as little as I have... 16 min in... "That beard is such shit"
When he said 'genau' I burst out laughing, class content Magnus!
That guy was super supportive. What a dude
Magnus gave away his identity when he asked for the chalk hahahah
Awesome video
In 40 years, Magnus is going to be dressing up like a teenager and saying he's a newbie
i think he knew from the very beginning lol
I hate to say it, but I would immediately know it is Magnus... I'm sure the guy knew from the start and just played along with it. The beard was falling off and he is wearing winter clothes in doors. lol
Oh my god, i need it lol
His hands have makeup?
Very nice video
I could watch these all day. Please do even more 😝
Do the same but in a crowded gym with hidden cameras. I guarantee some amazing reactions!
Bro you got to do a fat suit disguise
Next Video: Pro Climber pretends to be a professional Parkour athlete
Nice
These are definitely my favorite videos!
Doesn't look like an old man but a guy trying to disguise himself.
He doesn't even look old
Seems like he definitely knew very early on. If so, good on him for playing along so well.
Need a new make up artist. Still look 12
pöölst€G v ?v 6:25 ah the gürrkin vv mentäll leiF is ´ingsöcciatiün ^?^
And here I am 64 and doing stuff trying to look younger
Dropping an old man fart or 2 (whilst under strain climbing) would have been good and effective 💨💨💨
nice video
A voice-over would be a great a addition to videos like this, allowing you to tell the viewers what's going through your mind while not breaking your disguise
Come on! That beard surely aint fooling anyone!!!! 🤣
Yo!! That thumbnail is my home gym!!!
9:30 the elvis leg had me dying
I've had the pleasure of climbing with a Yosemite OG in his late 60's and you can tell off the bat how great they are. He wasn't in 5.14 form any more, but he had the grace, technique and even strength that we couldn't mimic. There was no shaking legs, unsure movement, or out of control breathing. Magnus' imitation was great, but if you saw old man strength, you'd know right away haha
that coach was an awesome dude
He looks like he was bitten by a radioactive oompa loompa and was mid transformation @ 0:30 🤣
Frederick why your legs shaking like that XD
5.11c and jugs the whole way up?  This gym is soft or mine is hard lol...
You are so mean Magnus!
I know zero about climbing, but this was hilarious! The instructor seemed like a great guy.
That is the least convincing old man getup I’ve ever seen
<3 You are an actor my friend
Thank you for these videos Magnus. I don't think I will ever get tired of them. 🤣 Maybe next time see about getting a prosthetic nose to change the look of your face a bit. That might throw them off a little more.
His voice sounds young! But I know he is disguised so...
I just love your undercover style videos! I thought about starting climbing over a year ago but never did. The past few months you have reignited that spark in me. Love from Sweden ❤
Beautiful home, wonderful people🙂
Climbing with a scarf around his neck scared the crap out of me.
Bahahahaha the leg shake. Nice touch! Just cracks me up. I don't think I could film this with a straight face.
is anyone gonna talk about how what the dude said at 8:23 made no fuckin sense lmao
Why is no one here real or am I the weird one ruining the fun? like no way this coach doesn't see that this is not an old man. It just seems like a big show to promote the gym or the coach. Yes Its entertaining sure, but if anyone here really believes that the coach is stupid enough to believe that this "old" man is a beginner then you either have never climbed or your are climbing but you are really bad.   Seriously... things that this "old" man does while climbing are all details that shows that he already been climbing before. I have been climbing for like 6 months and just by watching the old man kicking the way he does while getting down with the rope I can see that he is not a beginner because I know how pros move when they get down. Furthermore just by looking at his body you can see its a young man in a costume.   Its just a show lets be honest, but still interesting.
13:40 was a big mistakes. If he hadn't gotten it already. Pointing his attention to you hands, surely was a wakeup call for him.  Hands are always a giveaway to 'old man' makeup. Unless you've went that extra mile.  Watching the video a few times, it seems to me, he might have noticed that something is wrong prior, but after this point, he definitely know that something is wrong. In the end, he's actively trying to get you to confess for a while. By pointing to your back story, as being redicolous.   Great video.
Oh ..kay...
Brilliant.
Beautiful
This guy is an EXCELLENT coach. So encouraging and positive.
Got my palms sweaty 😂
I would be so hot in all of that stuff
The genau got me
The scarf and the hat were overkill and kinda gave him away. That being said the instructor would have always recognized magnus right away, dude was clearly a big climbing nerd 😂
the shaky leg🤣🤣
It will be interesting to see what this Magnus will be doing when he hits the 53 year old wall that few surpass
Brilliant
Am I the only one that thinks the makeup was sub par?
Ohhh my God I died laughing seeing him to pretend his legs shaking in fear 🤣🤣 such good acting, you made it look so real 👍
I think you over played your legs shaking tho lol. Enjoyed the video!
I love these type of artist video
19:33 the dark humor and disapproving looks are great
HELL YEAH! I suggested this and I knew you would pull it off perfectly!  Much love Friedrich <3 ;)
🤣😂🤣
Actors without oscar))
That look at 8:28 !!!
I need to get facial hair like that 😅
Looks more like an in shape zombie xD
that bouldering wall is disgusting ahaha. im so used to beyond bouldering
Ah the foundry, used to be amazing but when we last went the staff were extremely rude and agressive to our newbies and locked my friends outside at one point for 15 minutes.  They don't seem to like chinese people there....
It will take more than that to fool an Irish fella. Well played, Kieran.
The young hands are dead giveaway
Tbh Magnus is not getting as recognised as he should, he put quality content but not many are subscribing and sharing to help him grow. Subscribe y'all. He deserves much better. He should be in 4M subs rn
The beard was awful. I am sure the makeup artist did great before he got to the gym but man it looked so bad in the gym. It was a dead giveaway. I wish we could hear the entire audio from whn the instructor was in the back. He seems like a great guy. Super positive and just loving life.
If an old man comes into my gym with a camera crew I'm expecting Olympic level feats of strength.
Looks like the climbing walls are on acid
Haha!  This was entertaining.  Good job 👏🏽
What a good sport and what a good coach. Super fun video
Hey someone follow me !!
These are always so much fun - its great how the people he tricks are such great sports lol
Too good at knots to not be a climber…
Haha the chalk addict in you kept subtly hinting about the lack of chalk several times 🤣
That coach is a great dude and deserves hella respect and a raise! 😄
Is this considered smurfing in climbing?
15:29 cmon don’t be a p*ssy
I loved the Elvis legs on the pink.
Wait, why does Magnus even speak German?!
I would have never believed he is 70 haha
Didn't see the end of the video yet, but damn there's noooo way the coach doesn't know what's up :D
First question. How did he get away with keeping his scarf on lol gimme a break. 😂
thats a freinds pubes if ever... you aint even fooled the 7/11 store my son
The way Magnus shakes his legs is so good!😂
19:36 josh is catching strays 😭 EVEN FROM THR COACH LMAO
You can still tell he's ripped under that flannel lol Greetings from Franken!
That coach was amazing and the "before you die" comment that almost crippled him keeps making me laugh
I know yogurt
The teacher is a legend. So patient and motivational. Good man! And Magnus was really into it. Very nice, give the man a Hollywood role somewhere :)
That Elvis leg 9:40 XD
These videos are getting more and more fake.
Cheeky knee, good to see!
It´s so funny that you even swear on german.
So the camera crew isn't a give away what so ever???
the German accent was really good, and throwing in German words here and there was hilarious. love it
Low key looks like Michael Reeves in disguise 😂😂
The coach is a regular coach in at least two of the Sheffield gyms I think, he's a lovely guy and a great coach from what I've overheard from his sessions. Very knowledgeable fellow.
73 was a stretch 😂 should have gone for 55-60
hahaha, when he pretend to shake his leg.😂😂😂. And the coach is a better actor for sure
Such a fantastic video - I cringed (in a good way) at how funny you acted as a 73 year old! Keep it up Magnus and thank you
u gotta climb with this instructor again hes awesome
You need to add a little scratch and/or rumble to your voice, a bit of age :-P .
The coach was BRILLIANT. Such a cool personality.
Just want to comment that description of this video seems to be from previous video. (otherwise great video)
It was obvious the instructor figured it out from the start lol
You didn’t notice his smooth hands and athletic body? That would’ve made me go 🤔
you just have been mitdboed :)
These videos where people play down their skills to do these are silly.  Expert guitarist dresses as a beginner blah,blah,blah.
"- 73?" - I think this bold claim kinda gave away to the coach that something was off. Definitely didn't sound or move like a true 73 years old.
It looks like you
you need actual prosthetic realistic masks and stuff, you don't really look that different here haha
the poor instructor thought he was doing such a good job haha
He did all of this in bulky coats and scarfs and makeup and everything
i like the quote this guy came up with "if you're not falling, you're not trying"
very funny video, especially when magnus said scheiße and other stuff
My hands are slippery.  I forgot to give you the chalk.....  Practically laughed out loud!!!
thumbnail looks like jaakko saariluoma
Magnus, you have to wear a body suit to make your self look a little fat.
everyone knows that face lmfaooooo
Magnus you deserve an Oscar for this performance🤣🤣🤣
I donno if I'd have the guts to pretend to suck up there. xD
15:28 motivational words from the coach
Really loved your cursing in German 😅
Kieran’s a mate of mine from home in Cork and I had no idea he was in this video, bloody brilliant 😂
When you are so good, that you need to practice on how to fail.
Your body language is hard to conceil, no matter how much make-up you put on. I think you have a certain, very specific way you move and that gives you away: others pick up on that subconciously at first and register: There's something off here...and then your cover is already 80% blown.
the accent so funny😂
2:45 *intense hand shaking*
These types of coaches are rare. If you spot one, please ca your local good coach-conservation center immediately
I thought it was count Olaf in a new costume in the thumbnail
Camera crew, hats and scarf... etc... BS
His face looks old but his body cannot be hidden😅
I love when he knows and just plays along and makes Magnus get on the red 8b. haha. baller.
How does magnus keep it so dead pan, when everyone else is laughing so hard around him.  Give him an Oscar.
this is gold! i love these pretend videos, they always crack me up and they are informative and entertaining too!!
First you were a duck, then you were a chicken... next a barn door 😆
You can tell this guy knows who it is slresdy
The scarf is the best part.
So an instantly and obviously fake old man pretends to fool a coach, who is not fooled but pretends to be fooled, in order to fool the YouTube crowd, who is also not fooled but pretends to be fooled. What is the point? Everyone just pretending to be fooled? The emperor has no clothes.
Doesn't look 73 to me he should have said something in 50s, so that's a red light for me to spot
2023 yet people still can't make a convincing fake beard. Might as well have put on the ol glasses and nose disguise.
7:12 „ungefähr“ 😂😂😂
Do something useful, don’t waste time in being fake
Love the Foundry, crazy to see Magnus blitzing the same walls I've been up as a casual
You close all the “gym” and it’s not fake ??
#1 professional female cyclist 🇺🇸✌🏻🇺🇸🐺🇩🇪 I said that in fluent German…
Some of the most interesting bits of these for me are the different approaches to teaching the skills and the different analogies they all use to teach.
The only logical next step is to put on a big man body suit and act like hes 150kilos. If that doesn't get eyes popping than idk what will.
"You know who Messner is?" Yeh, he's Italian lol
Need to do a fake nose and chin.
My foot and hands were sweating like mad...
You look like Jim Carrey in series of unfortunate events movie when having makeup to look like an old sailor! Respect!
It was the voice that gave it away. Doesn't sound old.
Next up "Pro climber pretends to be 4 year old boy and tries all the hardest routes"
Thoroughly enjoyed this vid, great teacher BTW !
i mean, the cameras are there. It's very obvious
hey this was really entertaining!!
The fact that he is wearing the scarf throughout the video is hilarious, I'm fairly certain it would be a choking hazard...
i love the army videos but can u try to do MJK18 army in norway plz i am going in there soon
I think the coach could tell immediately. If you watch Magnus start to climb you can see the definition of his leg and glute muscles and he looks like a younger toned athlete.
Magnus, you're actually such a good actor🤣
That scarf would not be allowed in a gym I was working the floor.  Last thing you need is a client hanging themselves.  I saw a degloving of a finger because of jewelry once, and prefer never see it again.  Remove all loose clothing and jewelry
Lol the way Magnus moves quite fast and the fact his hands haven't aged gives things away lol
Pro climbers when they reach the top and have to come down.
You can climb..but you can't hide Magnus.  I can run....but I can't climb.  You have got me climbing Magnus, been going 2 months now.  I love your channel!
Instructor is the cutest thing, not hard to tell he’s Irish
Baris W
sweet, Frederick is the name of my fridge :)
When he had the massive fall about 9 or 10 minutes in, that climb his legs were shaking and ngl that happens to me cus I have a damaged muscle in my calf
Watching him shake in the knees was absolutely hilarious knowing who he is
I love how the attendant ignores his age and keeps pushing him based on the skills he’s seeing.  After the old man says he can’t feel his arms, at 16:05 the attendant says “Would you like to take a few minutes then try something even harder?”  🎉
Laughed until I cried. Made my day!
LOVE how knowledgeable this coach was 8D corrected Magnus's sketchy history several times, and knew of an ACTUAL climber of the previous generation still going strong 8D calling you out XD
Coach: First you were a duck then you were a chicken.  Magnus: *seriously thinking to take the shirt off*.
I love the video, but is no one gonna mention how bad the beard looks??
Haha, "zuzuzu" its to funny. Magnus as a german grandpa
Scripted
Good german accent, but its pretty hard to disguise since his voice doesn't sound 70 years old. Also climbing with suit pants, jacket, scarf and hat, that just ridiculous 😅😅 But also fun!
As a German I loved how he built in these random German words😂
The instructor is so knowledgeable!!
Just had to add one more cheer for that coach. The most motivated and motivating instructor ever.
I haven't watched all of this. But 100% this dude knows from the start.   I'm not a climber and I'd recognise mitbo and his voice.
obviously staged, how did the camera man explain himself 😂
This was hilarious!
😁...It never fails there's always someone in disguise 😌..Respect Love and Help each other I feel better now✨
wow ive been to this place in sheffield. great video i really enjoy this series
Got to love how excited amd into it the instructor was
Hey Magnus! Thanks for becoming more comfortable with performing on youtube man you are making great content!
maybe boulder dressed up as an old guy and only have the cameraman film with a phone or something.
lmao bro killed this acting job
He knew right away
You should really dress out more.. like pretend you are on a "utdrikkingslag" and have silly mask and stuff.. That could work and be fun! :)
you will need to find an Eldery community  and let one or two climb before you
wow what a great comments section.  I learned about the German words here and there which I didn't even know about.  I gotta rewatch this now... 😄
When magnus called josh a p*say then the coach agreed that was hilarious 😂. What a great guy the coach is
Nice video
Nobody buying that beard
There's no way anybody's actually buying that disguise.  The make-up and beard are so obvious... particularly when the beard started falling off, haha...
Damn, your german accent is on point!
When he started tap dancing on the holds
Magnus too famous, can't get by anyone :/
So F'n pointless and stupid..  WTFever, can't you find something better to do for views?
Love how he looks like an old timey climber attempting Everest for the first time
Do you still want to climb at 73 Magnus?
This man is a menace lmaooo I cannot handle the shaking legs
good coach fair play to him
yellow shirt is a super nice and respectful guy
ive been to that wall its a W
I know 70 year olds fitter and younger looking that this guy.
Lol you could tell the guy knew right of the bat.
The fake beard would've gave it away for me. Wrong type of hair and too patchy.
Very informative and interesting video. Thanks for sharing with us.
try using different colour eye lenses, or maybe a girl disguise? :D
I heard you speaking some german. Are you from Germany?
If I ever see an old man doing anything I’ll be assuming he’s crazy good at his shit
The interesting thing is the camera lens coatings enable us to see through some of the make-up. What a lovely guy the instructor is.
It was SOOOO obvious that that wasn’t an old guy. The shape and volumes of the body can’t lie. Despite whatever make-up. …
That was the least convincing old man I've seen on YouTube
the fake sewing machine legs 10 minutes in had me rolling on the floor 😂
Nigga dropping names like hes related to them. Legend.
Very nice video
So nice he actually used German words 😂 ungefähr, zu, scheiße and so on
Get Tomoa Narasaki on the channel! That would be great!
What a great dude honestly he coached you with no judgement and passion
For me personally I feel like that kid knew right out the gate that this “old man” was an expert 😂
We all like hard mountain men
It's Halvdan Sivertsen!
I cant work out if the trainer/worker is British, Irish or American
I think you didn't understand the concept, you're supposed to have a public/audience to react to the "old guy" that impresses everyone around. This looks so scripted
He could have noticed that he is a pro because he knows how to use and tie the ropes ...
Damn it sucks that I can tell he knew. You need to make these videos quick.   Fat suit.  Go and mess up hard then destroy  then add the filler to make the video.   Gets a better reason.
Did anybody else hear him calling him Mag/Frerich 10:03
this instructor 🥺🥺 love him and how he played along
these are hilarious
The reverse Punk is hilarious
feels like an episode of cyberchase.
I’m in love w the coach
Next Video: Magnus comes to gym dressed as blue Navi from Avatar, says first time climbing ever on earth.
ok  good
🤣🤣
The fact he's wearing a scarf through all this is hilarious lol
don't forget makeup on the hands. you can tell someone's age from their hands and his hands dont have any wrinkles
There is no way this man didn't recognize you. He clearly knew it was you.
You are basit video
Personal opinion / theory. Feel free to discard it.   I think Bojrn was a better disguise. Old Man took a lot longer to set up *but* it was still essentially you, but older, which is something people can more easily recognize. Bjorn gave a very different vibe.
Some PPL actually believe in those WWE type scripted old man meme makeup videos?
these videos are so fake... bummer when you do skits i wish they were real.. SKIP
why is he still wearing the hat and the scarf, gives away the disguise like bruh who the hell climbs with that on
What a fantastic coach
this is what smurfing looks like outside of video gaming
Awesome coach!!
the camerman tho
Magnus should try old Jingwu style wall climbing, where you climb into your local government building uninvited
Recognize his climbing style
"The trad climbers never fell off" Where'd he hear that nonsense ? The voice was wrong for a 73 year old among things.
Marcin Banot, BNT. Go, meet him. I hope, You know him, right? ;)
everyone knows dude
the coaches are always so nice in these videos
The coach was fantastic. So much knowledge and care 👌👌👌
The fact that he kept the microphone on break was hilarious! Also what a historian he is too.
Look like a guy nursing a zombie bite who hasn't told anyone and is enjoying his new found athleticism before he succumbs to the zombification
This video was 23:41 minutes too long
At first I thought this guy was Jim Carrey
The leg shakes lol, acting 10/10
I love the way Magnus screams
No old man has those legs lol
The whole thing was very nice. I like the way he played it back to you at the end
Great climbing and comedy. Wonderful entertainments
Very convincing performance. I am dual lingual german/english. You pulled that of nicely. Very entertaining vid. Really nice guy at the climbing place!
The only thing that would have made this video better is if he would have name dropped Magnus too.  He 100% knew what was happening from the get go.  Great instructor.
YOU LOOK LIKE A GERMAN GARY GLITTER
I don’t mean to be mean but that makeup artist did a horrible job.
“First you were a duck then you were a chicken” 😂
the guy in the yellow shirt is a paid actor..
so you basically think we are stupid? (After reading through the comments, okay sure, some [most] of them are) but that doesnt mean to make matters worse. dont contribute to their downfall.. What im saying is, if you think we think the employee think this is absolute bs, then well, i guess, according the dummies in the comments, youre right..but you didnt trick me lol. the last 3 times youve done this shtick, it was cringy. now its just horribly unbelievable
the 61 year old did that red wall is insane
He reminds me of Goldmember !!
Love the foundry!! I began climbing there at 8yo in the late 80s
This kid is a great teacher.
oh damn, sheffield! was a student there for a few years and even climbed at a couple places in the area a few times, love that city. hope magnus enjoyed the other stuff Sheff has to offer while he was there!
That disguise is fooling nobody lol
Aha great acting but the clothes are WAY too new for an old guy. Eyes are too similar too, that’s where people are recognisable. Eyebrows might have helped.😂
I thought this would get old for a third time. And it didn't. Well-done, bravo!
When he starts cracking up 🤣
“That’s a very short rope, isn’t it?” Ha ha ha! Comedy gold!
this is next level cringe
I think they should get an old man to pretend to be a pro climber. Now  that would be impressive.
These would be better if you just dressed up as an old man and climbed in a busy gym without the staff reacting but the people.
The facial hair always gives it away.
im 52, can't do a push up but can run forever.  Ya think I'm ready?  Shakes head vigorously side to side  NOPE!
What idiot dude would wear those clothes to go climb? Everyone knew you were a phony. That were just being nice lmao
I don’t think anyone realizes how amazing of an English speaking German accent he does. Even when he mixes up his words it’s sooo German!
Should have used a real MUA who does prosthetics
The trouble is genetic... Norwegian people are stoic and unable to act.. This guy is himself and talks like himself, can't even make a shaky old man voice.
Still looks like a young man to me.
I think he figured you out when you did all the fake leg shaking and still kept climbing lol
It still looks frake as fruck
Wait, you’re in the uk?? Pls can I meet u pls pls
He was like "let him have his video content first" lol
Sender!  👍
The leg shake alone is Oscar deserving.
0/100 chance anyone’s believing that makeup lol.
Damn you were in Sheffield! Hope you liked Yorkshire
This is pathetic. We - climbers - have really hit the low, when such idiotic stuff is watched by so many.
He's not one bit convincing as an old lad 😅 Too much energy, old age is characterized by stiffness
🙄 uf ...
I just like the video without even starting it at this point because I already know it's going to be good! 💯 Didn't even think about clipping in! 😅 Deep inside thinking 🤔 I've climbed cliffs to the moon bud! 😂
IN A JACKET!
Hilarious switching from a German to thick French to Norwegian accent
Give that man an oscar, that acting was outstanding (I say that as a german) :D Videos like these are always really entertaining, keep it up!
Magnus, you're getting too damn good at acting, you should consider a change in careers... before you die.
this instructor is awesome
hate when people try to age for acting.  It does not work and can tell from miles away
Bad times now for old mens in gym after thoses videos :D
That coach made the whole episode. What a great guy
He will be asked to teach undercover operations for military forces one day 😆
"Youre strong for 73" "senk yu" ich kack ab
"First you were a duck, then you were a chicken" Frederick: "👁_👁" Im done ^^
This guy seems like a really good teacher 😊
Spot on german english accent
The beard falling off, haahahahah, he was onto it from the beginning for sure
now that everyone expects an old man magnus you should do a fat suit
Pretty sure the coach could tell.
why all the the gym guys are so kind xD  its so nc for videos to work with good and kind people !!!
Next time get an actual mask that hides your face, you are too famous :D
So basically you're a fraud?
Sp: was hoping to see you flexing by looking old but takes off your shirt to show off. Start filming with an phone, go on as an average guy with a completely different make up and change your tone of talking this might bet someone better.
He doesn’t look anything like an old man. Pretty sure the guide has got him sussed from the word go.
For someone with no social media this guy has an extraordinary knowledge of climbing history
I have to admit Magnus German accent is actually pretty convincing (age appropriate, a bit of Norwegian shines through) (saying this as a German)
Fair play to the coach he was a very good sport
Frederick's dead eyed stare into the camera really sells it. Magnus is a fantastic actor
I love how this guy keeps calling him out for fake history
Magnus's acting is whats gotten better! you sold the show in every window!
Maybe it's just me but somehow the well trained posture gives it away, even with all those clothes over it :P
Oh man i loved this, Magnus you are such an entertainer and i wish you all the best!😂🔥
Who on god's green earth gave you the green light for that aging makeup. Woof.
Your hands are a dead giveaway
Man må jo gi instruktøren 10 av 10 for å manøvrere den sekvensen med buldring nydelig 👌🏻😂😂 Vet ikke om jeg hadde klart å manøvrere noe slikt like bra 🫣😂
My brother used to teach climbing wall at the ymca, and he’d tell me how about two to three times a week, this like 73 year old man would come in, and he was absolutely RIPPED. Like, Hollywood actors wanna be him ripped. Anyways, this old man would walk in, and just go up and down on the pegboard 3 or four times just arming it the entire way. I’m not a climber or anything, but I’ll be damned if I’m not inspired by that guy
this is actually awesome
Was smiling the whole way through, really enjoyable video, the guy was really knowledgeable, friendly and good fun, was nice seeing you try to pretend to be a 73 year old on-sighting really hard routes especially when he didn't reveal he was on to you early on!
Lame
I love that he didn't take the scarf off the whole video
Magnus the German comedian.
Come on man I've never even seen your face you're not that famous
You're absolutely milking this "pro climber disguises himself as beginner" and I absolutely love it
19:32 *me being named Josh* 👁️ 👄 👁️
That employee sounds American even though he's British.
Gotta say, I think all of these punking videos are really stupid.  Guitar, climbing,  etc.,etc.
Shoutout him for getting you a video and not exposing it early.
Never heard a rock climber call somebody a pussy that doesn't rock climb the way they want them to lmao kinda weird
Rental crap shoes lol. Guy know his gear
Climbing with a scarf?  How to get strangle 101?
What a great coach!! Keep the good work up ma man!!! Happy to see you
Before you give it away you should take your shirt off and climb a route lolol love your personality Magnus!
This is stupid
What a fraud.
Why would someone do this ?  Seriously. What is the point ?
Auto Bee Lay does it lay bees down?
This is my favorite type of video!!!
I went to the foundry in Sheffield for my 6th birthday 16 years ago. Crazy to see it’s still going! Awesome stuff.
yee you looked exactly like yourself
Scheise!  🤣🤣  Well he's old, so he's got less to live for 😂  "Before you die"  How Magnus stayed in character there????  😅
This is the best content ever
the accent😭🤣🤣🤣
12 boutta turn 10 😂
👍
Making a believable old man make-up isn't easy. Patches of loose beard isn't helping.
I am a climber - if someone came to & dressed up as old man or a woman & did first three moves on rock face or a indoor climbing wall - I would know instantly they are climbers.
The shakey legs and the "feet back on!" And the old German man screaming 🤣
I could not stop laughing when magnus’ beard starts falling off
I love that despite him figuring it out, he played along. What a good video!
You look like Jim Carrey as Ebenezer Scrooge
I go climbing there every monday lol.
WP sir
That's a coach you can trust right there.
8:29 make-up doesn't work. It's obvious who you are right there.
it cracked me upp when they tried the autobelay! *are you shure about that* hahaha and magnus fake testing the rope! hahaha
most friendly guy in the world, absolutely lovely
worst footwork ever Magnus!
Outfit for climbing :/, it’s hard to watch.. it's strange that they let you be here so dressed up
Lmaooo amazing vid 🔥🔥🔥
The cameraman be like: 🫥🫥🫥
what do you think guyz, is it possible to be a beginner in climbing in age of 30+, after inguinal hernia surgery? in gym only i mean
I think it could be even funnier if you went to the gym as yourself the day before you dressed up and try to fool them.
back in the days hahaha
Anyone who's looking at that stupid makeup would spot right away, just take a look at that hilariously bad beard.... come on
Please another one but next time with a believable make up 😂 what's with the pube beard ?
i really enjoyed the video even though he knew it was you
enough already...
"don't be a pussy" -based coach
ive not climbed for about 5 years but when I was younger I used to be really into and would climb at foundry all the time and for I think my 10th birthday I got crack climbing lessons from Pete Whittaker and Tom Randall and foundry amazing gym
You have to come back and send that 14! We all wanna see that...left us hanging there bud
Does Alex Honnold have a youtube channel? Who knows?
He doesn't look old
Everybody that cares enough about climbing to work as a climbing coach knows who Magnus is
The funny thing is Magnus actually couldn't do any of the routes til the coach got him the chalk bag.
The beard is an absolute disaster 😂
12:58 Das "scheiße verdammt" klang echt gut 😂👍
that shaking legs, what a  joker hahahaha
The leg and foot trembles were awesome. Nice one, Magnus
It’s funny how he’s pretending his legs are shaking in fear
Love the german words here and there! Especially the "genau", you will hear it every now and then from english speaking germans who haven't completely switched over yet. 😄👍 So do you speak german Magnus? 😃
winner there was the instructor, good guy..
I love how the coach told him "dont be a pussy" and he went beast mode
he doesnt look like old man, he looks like middle age crysis hipster
comon .. no old men are built like this haha
When exactly did Josh(?) know? Rewatching the whole thing, it could be any point in time :)
Hahaha oh man, I live literally acriss the road from the foundry (kelham, Sheffield) and go to the Hangar, which Magnus also went to so it'll be cool to see that in an upcoming vid
"Like Josh! He's not hardened by the mountains like you." 🤣
The power screams HaH
Great video :D
That coach was awesome!
fresh looking 70 year old
I love the coach.
This was a great one!! You made me laugh😂, hips🤣🤣🤣!  Well done Magnus 👍
Man shoulda said 55 years old and not 73. That did not pass hahahaha
nooo i could have met you i live in sheffield and go to the foundry to climb.
Зачем ты так, Магнус? Нам и так недавно до 65 лет пенсионный возраст подняли... Сейчас это, кто-нибудь в Кремле увидит и я вообще свою пенсию никогда уже не увижу! 🥺
Awesome vid. Thanks for gathering all that info and sharing with us!
The beard was so bad haha. I wouldn't be surprised if some tufts of hair came floating down on some of the climbs
You played the serious german who never laughs very well. Cheers from the Frankenjura
Hi Magnus, an idea for you: go to a Parisian Firestation and beat the firefighter at the plank (difficulty, number of reps..)
Think u could have gone with 45-53 age range idk if he buys 70+
This is so cringeworthy! Worst acting
10/10 Video! Keep up Theo great Videos!
he actually learned some german words there, nice
I'm sorry but this beard is the funniest thing i've seen online today.
The coach as awesome, funny as well.
love these videos man keep it up we need more military ones tho
bro i love you magnus been watching for years now
I want to see you do this disguised as a sea turtle
Took a 20 year hiatus from climbing. At 40, I decided I was tired of waiting for the right time to begin enjoying climbing & backpacking again. Then 2 years ago  I quit everything when I found out I had heart valve problems. Gained 50 lbs.  I credit Magnus's videos with helping me get back to it.  I finally decided it didn't matter what I look like or what people thought. It's not easy doing things I love with heart problems & having gained weight,  but I'm enjoying every minute of it! Thanks Magnus!
Come to Jordan<3
Not sure when he caught on, but that loose chunk of beard is kind of hard to overlook 😆
So is it normal to wear a scarf while climbing??🤔
You are a beast on the wall. You make it look so easy.
Magnus is really childish😅
I love this trainer, how is he so damn wholesome
Wow! I know absolutely nothing about climbing but i’ve just seen your Bjorn video and this one and you really make me want to try that.   But i’m not sure if i could lol i’m afraid of heights and also my eyes are bad. If i get a hit, or fall or anything like that i could become blind because of my super thin retina. :(  But climbing really looks fun! 😁
seems pretty stupid they'd allow someone to climb with a scarf on. easy strangulation hazard
With this level of acting skill involved   , a new Hollywood actor is born 😉😉😉✌🏼🤩
Went way overboard with the shaking legs but had to commit. Like a footballer faking an injury on the field 😂😂
Come on Magnus that make up artist just put a beard and a mustache and that's it. It was pretty obvious from the get go. lol.
Uncle Magnus
next time grow your beard Magnus:D but enjoyed the video as always
When magnus is 70 he will be climbing mount averest without safety
When he started screaming on the 5.11 after the guy said don’t be a p***y, I died 😂😂😂
LOL. You pulled it off so well, I forgot who you actually were, and felt bad for you at 10:25 😂
Magnus so goat
I've never done any climbing but i can't stop watching these climbing videos 👀
What a great video. So entertaining. Thank you!
Magnus is gonna end up recreating the I don’t wanna be here anymore guy from I think you should leave
The leg shake 😂🤣 he has it down so perfectly!
I would recognize Magnus so fast, even like this.  HIs eyes give it away.
This coach is a very nice man
Man those leg shakes were on point
These are fun even when they realize
Love these videos. It might be easier (and cool) to surprise an unsuspecting public with sick climbing
Instructor has such a great attitude. Awesome guy
I really want a cocky magnus in some kind of fat suit character that says they don't understand why it would be hard and then flashes everything.
Im sorry but I really hope he doesnt think he Really is fooling anyone xD
I think 73 years old is a bit too much. It would be easier to fool people if you said you were 60, for me it would be quite impressive to see a 60 years old climbing like that! Also, in my opinion you still look like you in disguise!
Magnus doesn't even wear this much clothing outdoors. He must be sweating buckets under there.
It is quite fun to watch the pretence but is perhaps a little unfair on the coaches. I've seen it also in arm-wrestling.
have you ever heard of campusing before? 😂🤣  this coach was an absolute blast, super encouraging and with so much history knowledge
Your legs totally give it away I think, you need baggy pants to disguise the muscles!
I think the beard falling off would’ve been a give away to anyone that something was up
The beard coming off is top level comedy 😂 Great video Magman 🤘
that beard wasnt really the best :/
Can u do one on Torsov climbing senter in Norway next time? I climb there and it wold be very fun
Pretty obvious makeup my guy
Hahahaha the versatile accent 😂😂😂
I mean the costume is not bad. But who climbs with jacket, hat and scarf?? 😅 And I know for a fact that thats not a german thing. Hahaha
2:53 I drive one!!!
First the duck! Now the chicken! You making progress! :D hahahaa
Lol i think the fact that he was climbing with a hat and scarf inside gave it away early
That guy is blatantly the son of George Mellory.
WE LOVE YOU KIERAN
Hey Kieran
12:59 SCHEISSE VERDAMMT! 😂😂😂
"THEY PUT TOO MUCH SHIT ON ME"
I was skeptical of these videos but all the people are so great, and its really fun to watch. Those big falls and cutting loose and recovering were fun to watch
I didn’t know Matthew McConaughey is a climbing trainer as well
15:20 did i just hear someone say come on Magnus in the background? :)
I don't think anyone believed this story.
wait what, do  you speak german Magnus? that "genau" (at minute 6) caught me off guard lol
ROTFL!!!! I enjoyed this video like you wouldn't believe! Excelent!
Again you found an awesome coach to prank. 8b+ in rental shoes wearing a big jacket, hat & scarf - respect (lol nutcase)
You're going to have to wear one of those silicone masks next time to fool people.
Man this trainer is by far my favorite. “Don’t be a p*ssy” 😂
damn magnus that bad climbing was pretty convincing :)
The way his tone changes after the 7c+ is amazing
That Magnus German accent tho..😂
Absolute prime stuff again! 😂
This instructor is a good man.
I lost it when he started shaking his legs 😂😂😂😂
Make up person did a horrible job, he looks like a rich zombie
that guy was funny
Magnus can you speak German?!
Ima join the haters. Why da fuq is u wearing a scarf the whole time. No old man would be wearing a scarf while doing physical exercise indoors
the climbing instructor is smirking the entire vid mannn
That makeup looked obvious AF
nice vid
This is so silly 😂, love it
How awesome is that. Including the accent and a german word here and there, you should think of a acting cereer😂
If I saw him Id be like, Oh, you know, you look a lot like Magnus's grandpa
sooooo cringe
This is prime content right here.
12:57 love the "Scheiße, verdammt"
had me cracking up at gotta onsight the 8c+... before you die, and Magnus' face 😂
Old dude with young people hands looks sus
Kieran?
Hey Magnus! Love these videos!  I think you should try this again with a different format. Instead of trying to look like a beginner on the wall, set the bait in the lobby during peak hours at a busy gym. Dress as an 80 year old to the point where you are totally unrecognizable. Huge beard to cover your face etc. Really act old in the lobby. Let the staff in on the ruse so they can help you play it up. Then start sending super hard routes immediately. Could also be fun to collab with Pete!  Best of luck, thanks for all the great content!
Love the shaking legs 😂.
Magnus next career should be in acting
So dumb! Blocked!
Great video!
As a german this fake german accent is killing me 😂 pure comedy
73 he gave it away right there. 58-64 would’ve been believable!
I didn't find this very believable because an old climber wouldn't duck foot and generally move shaky and awkwardly like this. They're not very strong, sure; but they always moving quite calmly, really. That would have been more believable I think.
the shaky legs! lol
All of those videos are cheap fake.... No way that someone who saw your videos, wouldnt recognize you.... So the only way people wouldnt recognize you, it's if they don't know who u r.....and in that case what for all the make up is..... Cheap ... It reminds me of little kids when they wear a hat or some mask and they running around expecting you to not recognize them... Common.... U put mustache coming to the gym and expect someone who knows your face to not recognize u?! How dumb u think they are? Or how dumb u think we r? I know... And I understand the idea... If you only could cover your identity just good enough that people know u, wouldnt recognize you... It could be fun idea for a video.... Like the videos of fat guys in gym that suddenly just taking insane weights... But for that to work u need to try better.... Even this grim of an old dude.... U just can tell that a lot of effort took place here... But it's just doesn't work.... Your face too recognizable.... U show up in gym with a camera if there will be even 1 your sub he will 100% identify u.... And instead of being fun video, in a second it turns into a pathetic desperate race for views... Put on a mustache ...... Hahahahahah just stop and think for a moment.... I can't believe that u yourself are that naive... The only way I can explain that are the views
the beard falling off tho
You should have deepened your voice or make it sound like you smoked a lot
You could dress as a black guy and i still think anyone in the climbing world who has youtube is gonna recognize you at this point.
Incredible
and the oscar goes tooo MAGNUS! 🏆📽️🏆
“Scheiße! Verdammt!” 😂 brilliant
Magnus midtbo VS Magnus Carlsen
I like that you switch between Norwegian, German and French accent on the English :D
Poor guy! He’s trying to be so helpful, he’s a great employee. This is good. ♥️ You rock  😁
No one buys this
Who would climb wearing a cap and a scarf? 😏
21:18 amogus
Pro gramer takes all gaetz doors and locks the gates behind himself
Why did he keep shifting from one foot to the other while standing? Old men tend not to do that.
Is that the same coach like from the other pretend this and that clips?
I can just picture the rock wall at the ymca and then this guy comes in “I can’t climb I’m old” and then climbs like hell and all the parents and people are like. Wow that’s neat.  Lol.   When professional race car drivers do this video it’s awesome, or pro footballs players.
I live in Sheffield!! Cool to see a local gym in one of your videos
to be honest, you as an old man with all those clothes, a scarf and all and then climbing: it is a pure give away. It already screams: HEY MAN! I AM TRYING TO FOOL YOU. Hence why you keep on all those clothes.
Magnus, you've switched your knot back to an 8-knot after the first presentation... Good video though.
Train your female voice and compete as a girl next time 😄
He still looked recognizable honestly
So cool to see @JoshRundle on your channel! May he get the views he deserves :)
Magnus - great at climbing, shit at acting. His voice and speech are a total giveaway, not to mention the camera. The premise of the situation is farcical, almost patronising. Still love Magnus though.
"I needed to not be recognised" immediately goes to the foundry
Fellow German here: Good accent and nice "genau" in sprinkled in between 😆
He doesn’t look that old, he looks like an Amish philosopher
I could absolutely tell the guy knew that it was Magnus.
As a german I can say - well done with the accent :) Sehr gut! Fun video to watch as always. Greetings from Kristiansand!
Magnus really just out here becoming a pro actor
If he doesn't try to recruit you at the end he must know lol
Half way through I've picked up on 4 slips where magnus goes into his regular voice for a sec
I do not enjoy that much the "pretending I'm someone-else trend" but please if you do this kind of video again do make-up the hands. I would have spotted the fake as soon as you tied that knot!
That beard tho... has a jorney of its own.
Magnus is packing😮😮
6:00 the "genau" was perfect :)
Scheiße verdammt, haha german cracked me up. No way he didn't know but still fun to watch
😎
being german it's so funny hearing magnsus swear in german
I love how the trainer played along. He didn't ruin your work by just saying "Haha, Magnus..." and so everyone had a lot of fun and we have a great video to watch. It also shows that the human brain isn't that easy to fool. You simply recognize differences when you see an actually aged man and a young dude who wears make-up and afalse hair / beard... and who is also mastering every damn wall like a pro. ;) And thanks for creating a good and funny German accent... I really loved that and how you implemented random German words.
Hardest challenge was no chalk bag on him for the first climbs
This was just a series of unfortunate events.
Hi Magnus. Try inviting a Jiu-Jitsu black belt to climb. They have strong grips and uses almost similar muscles as a climber (more pulling movements and feet, for example, pulling to guard etc.).
8:30 Me when my mom used to dress me and tell me I looked handsome.
Problem is his body looks way to fit to be an old man. Plus the aging prosthetics look majorly fake. Fail imo unfortunately
The shakey legs is hilarious 😂😂
I love how you made the lower level of climbing ability believable. The sewing machine leg was a thing of beauty.
Omg Magnus
Do one where you cant talk :O
I was kinda hoping that he said "c'mon Magnus" on the sly during that last climb lol
Man,, I remember, years ago, my favorite combination of people on YouTube: Devon Laratt, Magnus Midtbø, Jujimufu, Anton Fomenko, and even poor Tom Boyden…. Is that guy even still alive?  That day when you guys BROKE the ninja warrior course was peak YouTube haha….  Edit: hilarious episode, great work haha 🤙 Edit Edit: DUDE speaking of friendship,, you should collaborate with Pete Whittaker and STORROR…. Them boys are doing some wild shit lately haha
Guy looks completely the same. Basically put a hat on him.
I love these videos hahaha the hat actually seemed to make the disguise more noticeable but it was still a great video!
Best move in this episode was to pick a jolly Irishman to boost morale.
You really don’t look old…  maybe try another concept like pretending to be a motorcross rider or windsurfer (both sports develop decent grip strength) and you’re trying to branch out into climbng.?
Keep doing these so entertaining to watch! You'll just have to get some better disguises eh?
Outstanding video!!! Keep up the hard work.
Love these videos.. gotta say, this disguise just wasn’t that convincing! When filming these undercover stunts, Magnus probably needs to find less experienced climbers who aren’t familiar with pros.
Man, those first couple climbs were so sketchy, I would've been nervous belaying as he was really hamming it up early on with foot quivers and arms shaking on just the second clip haha
i feel like its harder to climb with that acting.
The camera guy needed to egg the kid on. Like under the breathe comments: This old guy makes me follow him around with this camera and always tries to show off how good he is at things but actually sucks. Something along those lines. Great skit either way tho!
Maybe try black face next time.
9:33 lmao the leg shaking from here on out
I'm not a climber and I would recognise you. You seriously need to drop these videos. They show a real lack of understanding human psychology and come across as kind of ignorant. We recognise more than the texture of a face. The geometry of the face can't be disguised. The posture of an athletic person can't be disguised. Your voice can't be disguised. Your mannerisms can't be disguised. Your arse is not the arse of a 70 year old. Your hands! Have you seen 70 year old hands? They know who you are. Always. 100%. This video was pure cringe. From the horrible beard to the terrible acting. Props for coming to Yorkshire though.
Maybe a fat suit and bald head might be a little more convincing, but even my gf who doesn’t follow Magnus knew who it was immediately 😂
Pranking the nicest guy on earth.
Lovely fellas, very entertaining 👍🏻
The constant chalking of the hands gives him away...
Saying you’re 73 was too much of a stretch and the beard was obviously fake. Gave it away.  But I enjoyed it anyway. LOL
Oh my god 😂 I'm not even done with the video and I'm dead! 😂 @josh "when you're old you have less to live for" the bantering is perfection. Can't believe neither of you broke out of character! edit: As I finish, I do have to say Magnus you just looked like an aged version of yourself, loved the video though ❤️
using facial hair that falls off...not really a good idea lol. Everybody can kind of tell makeup is beeing used also. I don't think any of the disguise videos where people can't tell are real.
I don't even like climbing but always watch his channel.
Dude yes. I can't believe you just took that whip lmao. And the guy was such a good sport he didn't even care😂. Even telling you to skip bolts on the head wall😂😂. Lead climbing vids are always the best.
If you want to see a professional motocrosser do this, search for "dean wilson grandpa"
I also love how Magnus' beard is falling apart by 16:00. 🤣
It was making me start to sweat just watching you climbing in with that scarf, hat and heavy shirt!
100% setup video, he obviously new it was him from the start
Probably the most clothing Magnus has ever had on while climbing.
Would have loved to see you try that route in your normal outfit (no shirt) but keep the makeup on hahaha what a visual that would be
That beard was terrible 😂 It literally looked like the beard of pubes from Jackass
First you were a duck and then you were a chicken. Tf is the dude on hahahah. Great video though, it was hilarious
I think the climbing coach is a very handsome guy and I want to go on a date with him. :)
How does the voice fit tho 😂😂
"Oh, yeah, I forgot to get you the chalk!" That loook in Magnus' eyes hearing that! I am literally in tears. 😂
9:56 the shaking of the legs are so good. it's like you where a real old man on that wall. Mycket bra
What’s up with world champions being named magnus 💀😭😭
you just look completely jacked under that jacket lol
What a nice guy that instructor is.
Hellou forem Prague. I enjoyed the effort you put there Magnus 👌👏great job and nice video
"Take that Friedrich, you POS!"
The shaky leg was a nice touch 😂
Rookie skier tries all of the most difficult courses but hits tree ends up in HOSPITAL!!
Jesus Christ that has to be the worst  fake beard I've ever seen
You should dress up as Adam Ondra and try out for an NBA basketball team.
Takes new year new me so far
More of this please!
Nice bit of acting, I loved the legs shaking& being out of breath, very convincing, 👍
As someone that is a old (65) climber, I found this quite, funny especially his Elvis legs, thanks for repping us old guys
Loved this. Great interaction between people who clearly knew that each other knew (or at least suspected) exactly what was happening. So wholesome and very funny. Oh yeah and pretty good climbing too!
The 'Genau' at 6.03 took me outtt 💀
Never seen this channel nor do I rock climb but I had to watch.
I guess next time you'll have to wear one of those movie masks of a 'real' face
How does the instructor not realize that more and more parts of Magnus'  'beard'  behave very strangely?
Didn't watch the video but I bet everyone was like "whhhaat an old man doing things and old man doesn't usually do omg" and then they all chuckle while I die inside am I close?
When He said don't be a pussy, that's when i knew...he knew.
so strange watching a whole magnus video where he keeps his clothes on
Lol... instructor had to have known lol good sport. Funny video
Magnus' take on a german accent: "Ja... ja... jajajaja" 🥸
On the rewatch of this, knowing Kieran was aware from THE BEGINNING, that makes Kieran's jokes and laughter after 19:00 SO much funnier. He was trying so hard to play along but at that point he just couldn't anymore and he's like wheezing with laughter xD Made me laugh so much harder on the rewatch
Thats a shit disguise. He must have seen you aint old 🤣
this is painful to watch
Should have shot this with an iPhone.  Real camera is sus for sure.  And putting in a belly would be good too.  You look super duper fit even with all those layers haha.  A layer of fake fat everywhere really.  Your legs are way too defined through pants too etc etc.  you need real looking fat suit. But then it would be too obvious immediately.  Idk… a few small changes prob.  Belly for sure. Edit: I keep adding thoughts… then fake a spider in your shirt or pants and freak out and just flash all the way up super fast 😂..
I lost it at genau, was impressed by ungefähr but just lost it again when you fell and yelled zu 🤣 Did you prepare your german or did you know already?
Part 2: Pro climber falls to death due to make up in eyes
Finally 😂 that was amazing
Hey Kerian! I am pretty sure I met you at ceüse! We tried a 7C "machoire d'ane". I remember when you sent it :) Good to see you here!
What a waste of time this video is. With big flashing cameras there...sure no one else expected you to be a troll hahaha please
Well, I guess the only disguise left is that of an old hag. 🤪  Also, you didn’t get the 8B+ because you didn’t take your shirt off! Duh! 😅
Magnus: if I was fresh, didn't wear rental shoes ... but Magnus's super power no shirt!!! Instructor laughing and laughing....!
Lol the fake shaky leg @9:20 is hilarious, somebody get this man an acting contract, it's so convincing!
Amazing. They can make the same when he is 60yo,  pretending to be young and making the same kmkkkk
Awesome
Wow, this video made me laugh out loud. They joy of the instructor and his positive attitude and how calm he was on the massive falls was super cool to watch. I'm myself a (gym-) climber for years and most of the climbers and instructors I met were super supportive and friendly - it's a great community. It's wonderful to see how much fun the instructor had and that he played along so well. The German words were funny to hear and actually pretty good (I'm myself German). Keep these videos coming. There are some pretty nice climbing gyms in Munich ;-)
thought he’s gonna take a break and go topless half way up on wall on the last climb
I opened YouTube to watch some relaxing ASMR… this was at the top of my feed and I HAD to watch this instead
massive wanger my dude
6:00 'genau' - on point =D
Stinker !
come on - this guy could see Magnus is a pro climber in the mid of a video
My man needs to be an actor because him on the wall acting like an old man was so accurate the shaking 🤣🤣
11:45 -  12:05 tying a knot without looking? that's a bit out of acting my friend ))))
10:55 Magnus’s facial expression in response to the joke has me dead
73 is too old to be believable, maybe 63 would be better.
I love these pranks
You can always tell by the hands 😉 can't fake old looking hands even as a climber.
His voice gives it all away lol
The first thing every climber learns,  even before tying a knot, is how to say 'come on' the right way.
go back and try that red !!
love it.
He knew from the start
I'd love to have a sessions with that instructor. Such a nice guy and a great climbing attitude.
I LOVE this Kieran guy!! Wow, he's a fun dude. Kieran 10/10
13:33 the fake beard is becoming dangerously messed up. This was funny. 🙂
"Scheisse, Verdammt!" 😅😅😅😅
GENAU! He said genau. That's the real way to pretend to be German.
Oh man Magnus, when you started the shaky knee, I DIED! SO funny! How are you so good at imitating somebody new to climbing??? hahaha
When Magnus climbs like an old man he still out climbs me
I think you have "jumped the shark" on the impersonation routines, otherwise I enjoy your videos.
How original. Tell me, does he pretend to be poor and then turn out to be amazing? Who knew?
The leg shaking at 9:35 ish 😂👌
When he said he was 73 no chance I would have believed it. 🤣
that was awesome :D  make more of this please) funny and epic at the same time
Yes, I am an old man in a rock gym *positively yolked legs and ass cheeks showing through the pants*
each video he gets better at fake-climbing
"Forgot to get you the chalk". LOOOOL. Where do they find these instructors for these videos, they've all been amazing.
Actually I don’t understand what’s the meaning of doing this 👀
Regardless, it was a lot of fun to watch.  He was a good sport about it, and he was also a really good instructor.
It was really fun seeing you act like an old man but like he said, is really easy to see tru cuz is just an old version of you Thx to that guy cuz he didnt say a word till the end so we got a nice video
That disguise is TERRIBLE. New Make Up Crew needed.
The instructor is a good one with excellent manners and a positive way of explanation
no way an instructor lets a “beginner” climb in that scarf
you serious? this is the worst makeup ever. 😑
Things I never expected on this channel: Scheiße verdammt!  This is definitely the best undercover video so far, especially with all the German sprinkled in.
great vid
ist the coach irish
As a German I have to say the Scheisse verdammt sounded really good.
Magnus' biggest struggle in this video was not using chalk at the beginning
Why does it say pro in the title but he falls off everywall
Next episode: 'Climber pretends to be a 14-year-old girl and tries all the hardest routes'.
"Scheiße, verdammt" at 12:58 haha. I love it! 15:32 is the best scene xD
Magnus DNA is far too strong shows right threw the makeup
Lmaoo I love these videos. I laughed the entire time 😂😂😂😂
I loved it! It was brilliant! And what a great instructor, had me crying with laughter. Than you :)
That effin' beard made me crack up throughout the video
There's only 1 thing for it now, going into a climbing gym dressed in drag
bruh...magnus Elvis leg game is serio 😆  lolol, poor belayer atp prolly still hadn't figure out wtf n, lol. I'd a been lil gripped feeding him further.
One thing I enjoy with these fake beginner videos is as the routes gets harder, Magnus can’t fake weakness so much and has to reveal his talents 😅
In my opinion, these type of "undercover climber" videos are getting tired and lazy.  This is the first time I stopped watching a video half-way thru.
such a feel good vid! Thanks to all invloved. Your trainer was awesome btw, such a good spirit about him!
Pro climber old timer
This coach is a legend, brilliant content. 👏
LOVE THIS
I catches me off guard when he throws in a german word here and there :D such a good job on the acting part!
i just don´t buy it .. this guy know Güllich, Moon etc but has never heared of the most famous climber of youtube .. in 2023?!?!
Magnus  is very welcome to be a german any time he wants😄
i mean, your face may be old but the clothes you are wearing just gives you away haha, you should choose bigger clothes, that way your muscles dont mark that much, this same theme with soccer was succesfull because of that
I mean not to be ageist, I know that some 73 yo are strong, but I think Magnus picked just a little bit too high a number to trick him (but I agree with the guy that although the makeup artist did well with the tools used he didn't look different enough -- AGED yes... but unfortunately aged Magnus hehe).  I think if he'd picked like 58 he could've fooled him a bit more in the future.  But unless you use hormones I think people lose too much mass for this by 73.  Possible?  Maybe but he's adverting both out of practice AND 73 -- that makes it too unbelievable.  I think this sets up a great collab though -- Magnus AND really professional makeup artists.  They can do prosthetics and change your face.  Change your skin, nose, hair, everything.  Your climbing might get sweaty, but if they just do small silicon prostethics with medical adhesive, it'll stay on and not be too bad.  If Sacha Baron Cohen can do it for 2 movies and several series -- I think Magnus can do it for a couple videos.  Gonna have to work on the accent though.  I was thinking the whole time... If you've seen Magnus, he sounds too much like Magnus haha.
“Hello sonny do you wanna hear about my grandchildren?”
"Zuu zuuuu das wird sehr scheißeeee" – Man that's some next level acting here, love it! 🤣😂🤣😂
Them leg shakes on the 2nd climb. When is this man going to get his Oscar? 🤣🤣🤣
"before you die" cracked me up so much. Actual tears of laughter
Bruh, climbing with a hat AND scarf on indoors for the first couple was funny.
that dude instantly knew who he was lmao
Looking forward to have a laugh when Magnus goes climbing as a woman 😂
Big up for the instructor dude being so happy, honest and supportive man haha. Good one, a lot can learn form that aye!
So fun! What a great sport! Both the actual sport and the coach! 😋
I just love how every time you do this, it just showcases what a great community climbing is.
I liked how he was climbing in puffer jacket and scarf. Real old school. 😅
The scarf is sending me
Your acting is getting pretty good Magnus
Thank you magnus, this was exactly what i needed in my life haha
You can be like me. A older guy in great shape doing stuff younger people do
After he figured it out, he should have had more fun with it.  Told him an 81-year-old nun did it just the other day.  Then continued, "Yeah, she did hauling up her dog in a basket." "Yeah, her ride was very impressed...you know she can't drive anymore...because she is nearly blind",  "She also insisted that she use the loafers she is used to."  And so on.
People pretend too much for the dumb reason of getting a reaction. Stop it. Get some help.
Magnus i like your channel but it feels like you're getting desperate for content :D
I like it how you were looking for a low-key climbing wall that isn’t aware of professional climbing and would not recognise you, so picked the most hardcore, dedicated wall in the countries climbing capital city 🤣🤣🤣🤣
How about "noob pretends to be pro climber"?
the fake shakiness of the feet lol
That facial hair is so offputting
Let’s be honest, with a camera man, you’re fooling nobody. ‘It’s a documentary on old people’ - 🤦‍♂️
I love how he uses german words. As a german it is very amusing and i have to say he is pretty good in pronouncing them aswell : )
V0, but your trying to dodge dodge balls.
You're terrible at acting like an old man xD
The fact y'all let that hair hang from his chin like that was ridiculous.
These types of videos are kinda annoying
The German accent is spot on.
So funny that you mentioned frankenjura, I’m from there and Kurt Albert was one of the best friends of my father! Great video as always Magnus! 🙌🏻
Magnus, if you play an old man you have to sound like one. Low raspy voice. It sounded like you used your regular voice which is already distinct. Fun video though
LOL at that makeup xD
When he said 73 I was like nahhhh too much broski 💀💀💀
amazing XD loved the crative aproach to climbing videos! also like the more hardcore stuff. thank you
I enjoy these videos so much, please make more of them! Also, the coach was great and I love how he played along even though he knew. 😄
I find it very funny that you dyed your hair, even tho you wore a hat the whole time
Magnus climbed the first half of this video without chalk. The things he does for this chanel 🤯
To famous for ur own good lol great times
Marijuana Stocks Moving Up! Buy MedMen Stock!! Buy MMNFF today........
First you’re a duck, now you’re a chicken  -Kieran 2023
after the break he knew :p
Well if it's getting too difficult trying to act like a beginner in front of a camera what if you just pretended to be some random old guy who is just really really good despite his age. Like a 70 year old who casually climbs 7b+'s  or something
when you actually turn 73, I want a remake of this video, mark it in the kalender magnus ;))))
Hahaha the German "zu... scheiße" was so on point
Climbing in the scarf! 😂
"73" loooooolll no way he believed that. the most he could believe would be like mid-late 50s haha
Looks fucking ridiculous.. as ifn
The shaking of his legs was the result of not chalking up from the start
The beard is falling apart 😂😂😂 how could he not notice?!
Nice hearing some old tunes from the kalymnos vlogs at around 15:30
Hahaha that fake beard is awful
he knows :)
Guess no one noticed the camera.
lol I think the instructor could tell this was  joke from the fact you never took off your scarf like a normal person would. your choice of clothes in general doesn't seem serious either haha
Old man climber pretends to be older man climber. Jk 😜
lol that make up looks terrible. you literally just look like a young guy with weird pale paint on your face
Fake ?
Jesus luvs u,God bless
I love these videos
Where was this?
Should have went with 62...
You should do an “uncle drew” style video where you go Boulder while the gym is open and send all of the hardest problems
What a wonderful coach and a wonderful (and convincing) performance from Magnus! Loved the video
This coach reminds me of Garand Thumb's host for some reason. He even has the same facial expressions.
that was hilarious
The coach is annoying
I'm waiting for the day where magnus is old and realizes he is Fredrick
HE DID IT!!1 He's Frederick now 🤣
Got to love this Coach. He exemplifies everything a good coach should. And he truly cares. Great to see. So dang knowledgeable, as well.
great video as always. Love yor content. Greetings from Germany
Fantastic video, as always!
🤣🤣 the fall was a little bit scary, I was was getting closa and closa
Ma boy Reinhold getting a shoutout, love to see it!
He got the german swearing on point :D
just seen your free climb up a mountain, have you ever thought about caving?
Worst German imitation ever 🤣 made it even more funny though!
i need an irish friend during my boulder session. that dude is a gem
I have seen ken nickels climb stuff that I fall off of 10 feet off the the ground he is in his 70s
“Prentends
In 50 years you can do this video again for realsies xD
No makeup on your hands)
he knew... he knew
I could tell he didn't believe 73. Was quite funny to watch though.
even if you don't recognize Magnus, its obvious that someone has disguised himself 🤷🏼‍♂
Head back and do that 8C+ please I'd love to see it
This is so over-the-top and so well produced. Thanks for the laughs. 😄
Thing is that everyone at the Foundry knows who Magnus is and most of their favourite Magnus video is the disguise one. I think his cover was blown before he walked in 😂😉
I always found these types of videos 'old man does hard physical challenge' kind of cringey. Also I think the instructor had known from the start that it's you.
The Elvis legs are hilarious 😂Magnus rocking out on the rocks
Your voice is giving you away...
Kieran is great!! Always helping and aiding people willing to pick his brains.
this video was racist!
Very entertaining to hear Magnus speak German or English with German dialect. Quite realistic, He nailed it! Magnus' Screaming... aaa I had a massive fit of laughter!  Funnily I myself am German and was born in the area around Frankenjura. XD How cute is the instructor Kieran- always encouraging and has immense knowledge about climbing history!
08:12 AHAHAHAHAHAH
Magnus had no chalk with him up to 6c+ route! That's impressive!
I really enjoyed these videos trying to fool someone. Pretty decent performance Magnus!
"back in the day of your alpine 7c+ onsights" i watched this at work and burst out laughing
Can't hide Fredrick's insane legs. Also, josh should have been surprised.
😅🤣😂
8:14 that comes so naturally lol I was at this gym last month but I was (and still am) too new to bouldering, so there were not many boulders I could actually do. Maybe next time I should book a belay training session there coach looks really patient
I just love how he brought the german words in like aaah zu zu zu (=take), sieben c plus (=7c+), scheiße verdammt and stuff like that.  I think magnus speaks german because he pronounced the words very very correctly
They let you climb with a scarf? At my gym, the coaches asks to tie hair and remove rings and necklace. They never would allow a scarf or a hat XD
your disguise is so bad, its so so bad
Next time go Indian!
He probably worked it out when your beard started falling off 😂
I love the moments around the end where both look at the camera with knowing looks As Magnus doesn't know the coach knew at the time and the coach is pretending he didn't realise anything haha  Great vid again!
Magnus, just stop. Stop
🔥
😂😂😂 great video haha Now for the next one you need a Mask like a Latex face mask that’s not your face 😂😂😂 or a prosthetic or something that makes you look not like you 😂😂😂
the chalk up in a pocket at 18:37 lmfao amazing flex
The beard after the 5.11c was looking real bad lol
Sorry, after the first whip .... nah. No one would be fooled.
The next time, search for an unknown guy proclimber
Hahahaha 7:11 "ungefähr Zen Meters" 😁😁👌👌
Feel like he knew ngl
I have begin climbing about 1,5 month ago, but I am already addicted to this channel :D
Why is his outfit actually fire 🔥
Man, make a collab with this instructor.  This video was SOOOOOOOOO funny.
Magnus kann deutsch
gotta love the irish
What a nice dude.
FIrst of all everybody who is at least a bit more passionate about climbing knows who you are and second you're not fooling anyone with that makeup :D
You really need this clickbait content :/ just give us your authentic climbing content :)
“I think for me it helps screaming.” This will be my new mentality for minor tasks
This is just stupid, everything for the views
The guy is just nice
Those are some super strong looking hands for a 73 year old… 😂😂
Love the climber-in-disguise videos! Tips for next time: Don't forget to age the oversides of the hands. It's a dead giveaway. And cry out the first times you "fall" - most people can't help themselves.
Neck and hands couldn't be of a 73 years old man, and the beard guys 🤣
had hear in Russia old climbers ain't use any rope.aint no autobellay
first irish climber/instructor i've seen on the channel ... 15:28 "come on don't be a pussy!" 😂😂😂😂
Kkkkk
Love this instructor
I really hope we gonna see a climbing video from you when you are actually 73 :D
Ok?
besides the outrageous falls and skill level of this "73" year old, I think the beard falling off in clumps was a bit of a giveaway :D
What did Frederich do for 80 years ago?🧐😉
hmm.. it's kinda hard to believe that any guy with internetz and passion with climbing doesn't insta-recognize Magnus .. well..whatever
magnus climbing weaker isnt cause hes an old man, its the sheer amount of shirts he has on
What's best is Magnus let's us see his wins and losses. He is humble and down to earth to show us that anyone can fail, even him. Feels like an honest friend
I feel like the climbing coach knew who he was instantly
It's getting boring not harder
Honestly, I just can't watch these videos. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable to watch because I hate seeing people be deceived. Even if it's a "white lie" with no real harm in the end. It just makes me queasy to watch.
Coach has a great personality!
Love your videos but I'm no big fan of this format tbh. It was okay the first time but after that it just felt so unnecessary to me to trick more people like that. It's just not fun to watch you 'pretend' to be bad at climbing - I can't take anything away from this for myself. In my honest opinion it would be much more interesting to take the opposite approach: Find someone who has never climbed before but wants to give it a try and see how good you can teach them and how well they can climb with your tips. That would be a cool format worth watching imo.
"First your were a duck, then you were a chicken" funny af coach🤣
Not me gnuinly rooting for Fredrik while Magnus was pretending to climb hard lmao
Climbing coach? More like climbing history teacher😂😂😂
very funny, great entertainment Magnus
I AM SCREAMING, I LOVE THE UNDERCOVER VIDEOS
I would think your hands would give you away. The skin gets crepey and the veins are prominent.
good german accent
The trainer is such a nice guy
Absolutely awful disguise
haha magnus kind of nailed the german accent xD
I think you could turn this into a series. Putting pro climbers in disguise to go into gyms and see if they can fool people. I don’t think Adam or Alex could fool anyone since they are so distinct, but Stefano, Jakob, Janja, etc. That would be fun. “Undercover Choss”
Great makeup, but, you just looked like an older version of yourself!! At least you got to see the future you. Next time.... FAT SUIT!!!!🤣
I dont know, my german uncels are definitely not that fluent in english. And their accent is way stronger haha
You need to find a person similar to the girl in the first video who didn’t know you at all
This guy from the climbing gym is just awesome!
This is not quite believable
Why ask what a back-clip is if you're not supposed to do it? )
The guy with the yellow shirt didn't get suspicious when he saw a cameraman following the old man???
Keep doing these, love these videos.
If the actor did any fake intros to the camera it would be cool to see those
I like how ur accent is surprisingly accurate, and you know simple words like genau
Is it just me or do those jugs look huge for a 5.13?! In the Southwest climbing outdoor 5.13 had tiny little crimps!!
This coach is a gem. We must save him at all costs.
C'mon he does not look like 73, something around 50 would be convicing but 73 😂That prolly gave it away.
"Sanks" 😂
genau :)
11:11 many new climbers know The Mango
Magnus must know a least a little German. For example, at 6:03 and at 7:13 he spontaneously responds with "genau". Maybe he picked that up climbing with his German mates in "ze Frrrankenyurrra" (or at IFSC comps in Innsbruck). It's a recognizable word that comes up a lot in conversation.
I was wondering the whole time why the instructor didn't ask "Frederick" to remove his scarf. I thought it might pose a safety hazard, like if it were to get caught on something. Now I know it's because the instructor realized it was Magnus from the jump and probably figured: _Eh, I'll let him keep his disguise on. He's a pro, I'm sure he can manage not to choke himself_  😂
magnus's void facial expression is hilarious
Man I love these videos, absolutely hilarious :)
Sorry Magnus, but those kind of videos are stupid :-(
When you are so good at climbing, you don't know how to backclip 🤣🤣🤣
Great coach
Kinda think 73 is a bit of a stretch, something around 60 would be better.
Hilarious
Haha I really enjoy the German swear words 🤣 Really funny 🤣🤙🏼
I think people can recognize you from your voice and face shape. Maybe try change you face shape bit more like bit rounder using fake skin 😂
Love the accent man
That make up is not convincing
Lmao magnus it looked exactly like you 🤣🤣
Your beard was fluffing off
He knows 😂 I watched it back to try work out the moment he went from suspicious to knowing something - My guess is around the 7 min mark. After the tea break he 100% had it sussed! haha great video!
kinda crazy to allow someone to climb with a scarf
Voice, shaking hands and legs.. Magnus needs try acting career :)
Funny and fake, you look basically the same xD
love that content haha gj
Loved this Magus!😂👴🏻
no way this time. I am pretty sure that he recognized you at the beggining
Do another on a weelchair
It's going to be hard for Magnus to go unrecognized. It would be great to see a series where you get less famous climbers to feature as the old men, Josh would make a great old man climber
It shoulds say I pretend,not pro climber. You're there mate. Cheers
The beard was dodgy as haha, no way he didn't realise it was fake
Bro lookin like count Olaf, great video. Your videos keep improving.
I got a bit tense when the beard started to come apart 😂
Hahahaha, old trick but gold. :)
by his smile you can tell that the instructor knows that something's wrong.
Haha 73 was too much, he already knew that you're not telling truth. Should pretend to be 63 or something :)
why not doing the same with Theo Blass ??
Your moves, your fake beard, your posture and first of all your hands... I couldn't think of anyone falling for this :s
I guess the only way to not get recognized anymore is to wait for the gyms to have a halloween or some carnival event
when you‘re old, you‘ve got less to live for💀💀💀
Not Magnus trying to make a Schwarzenegger accent to sound German 😂😂😂
Gotta say, the German cursing is spot on. Even fits with the age he tries to portray XD
Climbing with all that clothes, a scarf?!?! rental shoes can imagine how hard it would be!
thinking about it, i don't think many other climbers could pull this stunt off, for the simple fact that to keep the make-up good, you have to do the whole session without breaking a sweat
wish the beard grim was abit more stronger, was falling apart mid vid , great show overall x)
Great videoooo!!!!!!!!!!
Ace to see Magnus climbing walls iv climbed 🤣
its crazy how good you are at looking like a beginner with that leg shake and stuff
Eoic😊
Magnus switching to a French accent real quick had me rolling on the floor at 3:44
the shaking legs are what got me
The voice was a bit young for an old grandpa, you should've smoked a pack of cigarettes before entering xD
Maybe stop playing around with people who do not like being fooled...
Sheffield! Man, the Foundry was where I learnt to climb :)
Next version: Magnus crossdressing as Adam's sister. The power scream analysis revealed that you two are family.
What a lovable guy that coach is! When you talk about the 7c+ onsight and he eggs you on to try the 8b+ has to be my favorite part😂
Oh please make more content about climb history ! This is so interesting
Magnus in spain we have a lot of climbing walls run by some hippies who surely don't recognize you. it would be super funny
Way too obvious disguise.
Brilliant 😊
73 wasn't convincing enough. If he said late 50s, he probably could have kept it going.
Naja guuuut, der Typ kannte aber halt auch einfach alle großen Player im Game - darum hat es auch nicht geklappt. Aber war trotzdem witzig.
:D that was quite funny. The thing you cannot hide is your physique so just tell tales, like chopping your own wood oder doing Yoga or you work as carpenter, it might help a bit.
You shouldn't be surprised if a climbing instructor recognizes you under your disguise. Most people who like and practice this sport will have seen a video of you, if not all of them. Even though the makeup is fantastic, you still look like an older version of yourself and your voice is recognizable. Next time try it with a more hipster look, beard covering half your face and shoulder length hair.
first guy knew instantly.... then he started talking about the history and name dropping all these great climbers lol
This is just getting boring now and is rather condescending to the centre staff, but I guess today's generation love this kind of click bait crap... When I got into climbing, you and Jan Hojer were my training inspirations.... but now, you're just a dude dressing up as a dude pretending to be an old dude who used to climb hard once in a while. Fun times.
now we know to never trust magnus
Liked. Now time to watch it. Instant.
13:15 i don´t think a grandpa would fist bump like that xD
The _sarcasm_ of "back in the days of your 7c+ on-sites" omg I love it
Jesus, he went WAY over the top!!!
I really appreciate the effort Magnus puts into trying to actually fool the people he's climbing with. So many of these videos with a pro athlete ringer, they don't even try at all to disguise.
why was he allowed to climp with a scarf :D   Wonder if Magnus took any acting sessions, because he is brilliant at it, keeping his straight face like a pro.
Those leg shakes were legendary Magnus really trying every trick in the book 🤣
im pretty sure he knew it
73 wasnt convincing to me, sorry
Epic!!!
Gave it away with those overhanging cut looses xD
Smurfing irl be like
This old man has freakishly young looking hands 😂
Ja genau ! :')
Look more like a homeless man than old
Skinny hip jeans give it away, alter
Next time leave like old men and come back as urself start using the gym and see if he would notice 😂
His German accent wasn't that convincing until he said "genau" 😂
Great to see Magnus do this at my home gym!
I love this so much, my favorite series by far!
Weird seeing u in sheffield, not a big climber but i find it interesting and been a couple of times, fun to see u in the area
It's so funny, to see a non-german try to use some german words to trick another non-german...😂 Magnus, did you already had German in school? That would be interesting.
what's his tie in knot?? interesting :)
This prank is only fun and good mood, top instructor. Real laughs watching this ("this is a major whanger!"). GOLD
Magnus looks like the type of guy that cant grow facial hair naturally and the acting isnt really there..
Magnus turning into literal Arnold at 10:38 got me rolling 😂😂
it doesn't matter how good the make up is, it still looks like you xD
A really good call to do this in the UK, because this would never fly in the US. A staff member would see the struggle to clip and not allow you to lead.
this feels set up, how didnt he notice the beard falling off lol..
I'd spot you from the bottom of Karl Johan to the top.
Very funny video and very positive as usual. Great acting skills Magnus. My father-in-law is a 73 years old German and your performance really reminded me of him🤣
Magnus started to transform into Rob Schneider. Next time he will disguise himself as a carrot.
I love his so-formal outfit!
Magnus has mastered the art of climbing like a beginner, as well as being an old grumpy German man. Truly impressive.
'frederich'. 'nicolaj'
I liked your german swearing 🤣 very good
Surely most keen climbers will tell immediately 🤣 good effort though
21:15 I actually started laughing 😂😂
Old German = Doesnt stand around with his hands in his pocket :D Instant tell somethings wrong hehe
Your German is pretty charming 😂  the trainer is amazing. He knows his stuff
Would love to see the aftermath, like a chill session with the coach and getting to know them more too!
Lolol the bowline
magnus looking more like the middle aged homeless people i see on the streets in my city than an old man at the end of the video 😭
…He is smiling a lot and stuff but i think it’s just because he thinks I’m just kind of funny 😂
As a german, i love that he uses german words sometimes. Really good impression xD
Without the chalk, magnus is the old man😂
hahaha what a legend "come on don't be a pussy!"
13:42 Did you give him old man  grip or did you give him the full Magnus strength? I'm imagining you gave him Magnus strength and in his head he thought "Wait, this old guy has iron hands, what the hell?!"
Jetzt fängt Magnus schon an deutsche Rentner beim Klettern zu spielen😂
♥
This is brilliant
I am no climber by any means but I have free climbed 2 or 3 things so far in my 24 years of life. One being a beautiful boulder on Mt. Mitchells Balsam Nature Trail in North Carolina i cannot find any photos of it but my name is inscribed on a piece of wood i brought with me at the top of the rock. Would like to see one of you pros try this boulder and let me know what you would rate it if you can find it. From starting out at the parking lot its about 2/3s to 3/4s of the way up the trail after a false peak on the left side and before the Wardens Cabin if im remembering correctly. But this boulder is nearly vertical at the bottom but never goes inverted and actually decreases in angle toward the top. Nice 2-3 foot wide area where you climb up on after ascension then just to the left (up the trail toward the peak) is somewhat of a sitting area where 1 or maybe 2 people can fit comfortably. My phone died as i reached the top and before i got any pictures as i was enjoying the moment of my success since i was alone but the top of my name should be facing towards the trail/peak versus toward the parking lot. JCM or Sinnic would be what i wrote I cannot remember.
Proud Sheffield had a route Magnus couldn't flash 😅
Quite cringe  to see such a fake rection of the climbing teacher.... Pain to wacht this kind of content
You should have gone as the granpa and cameraman of a young talent and then say it's within the genes and showoff
You should have gone as the granpa and cameraman of a young talent and then say it's within the genes and showoff
Magnus' beard : *slowly degrades and falls off in patches* Magnus: *Suprised pikachu face* "How did he know!?"
10:36 why did Magnus start to talk like Arnold Schwarzenegger hahaha
Niceee lol I like how you addressed all the worries (about you not being recognized) at the begining of the video clutch...
Love that Fredericks beard was falling off after he had try a bit harder! 🤣
Really good acting, Magnus! I love the chicken winging, sewing machine and citing feet!
Any Germans ever heard the wall being called the shitty wall? I've never.
Magnus I love your content but this series is painful to watch
You are 73, do some damn warm ups. This is going to kill your joints.
70+ yr old man with 35 yr old hands 🤣🤣🤣  Another great set-up 😎😎😎
That's just Robert Crumb when he spots a rare vynil at the top of a hoarder's pile.
please stop making videos like this...  everyone sees that there is no old man coming.  the whole body stature etc.. Why should a cameraman film that too.  All of this certainly doesn't seem conspicuous to the climbing instructor...
I think the screaming kinda gave it away. Your voice already kinda high for an old guy, but the screaming definitely sounded not like an old person xD
he even shouted "zu"
Magnus: "Yeah in Germany we call it..."  Also Magnus: He can't check that, so let's just run with it.
This gonna be hilarious I already know😂
Content really fell off lately what happened?
In itself this is a really funny video, one thing though: in Germany, the general population does not remember the time between 1933 and 1945 fondly. We got history lessons and everything is pretty much critical about that time - so... Referring to a wall like that probably wouldn't happen...
“You don’t look that different” I think that about sums it up 😂😂😂
This will be magnus at 70. Even then he’ll be able to make these videos pretending to be young.
Beard was falling off the whole video😂😂
The fake beard was falling apart so bad after the halfway point hahahaha
Morsomt. Veldig morsomt :-).
We could all do with a coach like Kieran! What a sport.
Another great video 😂🔥
Magnus. Just stop
This video is just magnus being a better Actor than 90% of Hollywood, what can't that man do?
I'm afraid of heights, have always been afraid of heights, so even when I'm 73 you'll never catch me on a wall - but I love watching it.
"ja... genau...." 😂😂
At this point, Magnus is just showing us his acting portfolio. Magnus's personas need cameos in the Spiderman films. Marvel meets Magnus.
8:12 , I had to watch that again and again 🤣 Another brilliant video! I think if we videoed ourselves watching this we'd all have these goofy grins on our faces.
The *german swearing* does it for me
Its the hands. They are a dead give away. Older people have wrinkly and sometimes weaker hands. Awesome content though!
Love these videos!
What show or movie is this
The  make up is not convincing.
Next episode, Pro Climber pretends to be Normal Girl
next video show up to a crowded gym as an old man and just randomly meet people and just crush whatever they are working on...
Great video! Next time Magnus should disguise himself to a 8 year old trying climbing for the first time
Love these videos, I’m picturing a female Magnus next time 😂
The facial hair coming loose around 16 minutes in… ha!
Small suggestion for Magnus: I think it would be nice for the viewers, when ever they are naming other climbers a picture of them to show up on screen.
He should start telling people he is an old Olympic trainer or somethin
Hi Magnus!  I love this series but you need a new plan and I’ve devised one for you.  Keep reading if interested!   You need to go to America to the state of West Virginia, the city of Beckley, and visit The Chocolate Moose Cafe. You should wear a fat suit as a part of your disguise, add more facial prosthetics (nose and shave your hair), add fake teeth, and hide your sharp jawline with some prosthetic neck sleeve that looks like you have double chins. They willl never know!!! It’s a tiny tiny climbing gym with friendly people and great coffee! If you get a monthly membership  (~$75) they’ll are always willing to open the gym early for you. It’s one of the only indoor climbing spots in  West Virginia and usually only has novices and kids. Scout it out first because it is small and may be too small for you, it does resembles Adam Ondras personal climbing gym. Although the walls resemble limestone and it most likely has 20-25 routes total.  Alternatively, you can also climb outside near the New River Gorge near Fayetteville/Summerville West Virginia if that’s more interesting. You can get try water rafting or hike!  It’s a wonderful region and the local people will add charm to your channel!  Thanks for posting great climbing content! Please keep this series going!!!!! All the Best, KL
It's like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory where he walks out with a cane, pretends to fall over then does a forward roll.
Is it just me or dose he look like the bad guy from up
Thanks for the video Magnus. Keep up the good content!
Hope I'm in that good of shape at 73
impersonation vids are getting stale Magnus.  The Army challenge ones and the Marte ones are better.
Maybe as an idea if you continue on with this series of disguise videos, try going with a group of people and pass your selves off as part of some online news site doing a video on climbing gyms. Have an instructor show the group of "reporters" the basics of climbing and get everyone to try out some walls, and see how long it takes someone to notice the 73 y/o german guy keeping up with the younger members of the group, as they try harder and harder climbs. This can provide an explanation for the cameras, help strengthen the disguise by hiding in a crowd with a convincing story, while also making, I think, for a fun video idea :)
Coach: "Come on, don't be P----" Magnus: And then I started yelling
i'm so glad linus tech tips is finally showing gramps the ropes to wall climbing
Love your content:}
Yoooo that guy has my name!!
i suspect magnus is secretly an actor
He definitely knew. You look more like yourself as the old man as your younger self somehow. It's like it's a blatant attempt to cover up. :D
Your pronunciation of German words and German names, is on point 😂  Do you actually speak German?
That beard tho lol
It's pretty funny when he starts shaking. 9:34
The beard piece hanging I couldn't stop seeing it hahaha
yeah need to touch up on the ears, and neck actually...you can see the different shade of skin color on the neck and face...fun to watch still!
The bowline knot was a great touch.
When Magnus is 70 years old, I really hope he is still making climbing videos and recreate this video as an actual 70 year old man.
In 40 years maybe we'll get to see Magnus recreate this vid without the disguise XD
You need to have more stiff movements
He seemed to quick to make jokes about how close you were to death at your age. He was very knowledgeable and analytical so convincing him that you were 73 was always going to be a big call... I’m guessing you didn't have much make up on your hands so when he checked your grip strength he should have seen that your skin wasn't aged and the flexibility in your joints, ability to make powerful moves etc should all be giveaways. I guess some people are very trusting though so they can ignore their intuition because their character is to take people at face value. I just wish he had done something to turn the prank back on you. Making you climb the hardest one was getting there but I wonder what else he could have done to mess with you.
genau
Idk If the YSD conversion is off but all of this looks VERY soft compared to what I'm used to.
he speaks english with an french accsent and say hes german because he yells scheiße when he falls haha rly funny learn ur german doh  com to my country and practice ;D
The problem with the makeup was they made him look like an older version of himself they need to add prosthetics to look like a different person. Different ears, nose, jaw, eyebrows ect...
Magnus just casually inventing "Climb Acting"... the leg shakes are so perfect and intentional lol
Baller
The way he played along and made fun of Josh... priceless!
Come to Canada we have a lot of nice mountains to climb that are lonely
they'll keep your secret as long as you can, but they'll drive you up the wall doing it
The frickin leg shaking got me 😭
Beard's totally falling off...
Jeez old man, you are well on your way to TWO million subs!  The older you get the better you get!  Your gift for physical expression was also very strong in this vid.  I'm pretty sure if you (Found the time to.) did some acting classes you could actually get an acting gig that required physical humour/slapstick pretty easily.  Maybe you can find a way to use the climbing skills to fool NON climbers somehow - you are just too well known inside the climbing community these days.
oh my god the screaming got me
73...yyeeaahhhh...weell looks like ur in pretty good shape haha
Magnus is an absolute troll I'm dying
As a german guy I gotta say: this man knows how to impersonate an old german climber man... if the instructor was german, he probably would have noticed pretty quickly that Magnus is not actually german, but the body language and the general dialogue... fair play to Magnus man!
I'm just surprised they let you climb with the scarf on.  I usually don't like these imposter videos, but I think since it seemed to showcase the coach a bit more in the early phase that it was bit more entertaining.  He was really a good coach!
Could’ve gotten the red one if he had taken his shirt off!!
Not a chance he believes that guy is 73.
Couple of things: You need a FULL latex cast of your face AND neck. You also need your HANDS done.  No hats, wear a wig or color your natural hair white.  Same thing with facial hair. Don't fake it, grow a beard and color it white.
He is screaming😂😂😂so hilarious
His climbing IQ was just too high! Need to find a gumby, not a dedicated climber with no social media ;p
That's a very short rope.  LOL
Frederic Magnus Bjorn "shaky legs" Midtbo 😂😂😂
i just saw your pretending to be a beginner video yesterday, i love this videos!
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW MAGNUS WAS DOING THIS IN RENTALS!!!
Lol the coach knew it was put on right away. He was a good sport about it though.
Amazing, I've never seen a trick like this on social media before. You can't tell the difference between your get-up and a real old man with a super fit body. Uncanny.
Just a couple weeks ago I was in Arizona, climbing Picacho Peak.  It's a hike, with a couple sections somewhere between a climb and a scramble.  Here I was, holding onto the steel cables and climbing up the rock face, and just to my left comes this 70+ year old man free climbing it, barely using his hands.  Never underestimate an old man still doing something that young people struggle with.
That was hilarious! Every newbie at the climbing move was demonstrated, give this man an Oscar.
neck and hands always give away the age
Imagine meeting magnus and nos giving him chalk
Wish my progression was as fast as Frederick’s! 😯
yeah honestly Magnus, I have watched a couple of your videos, so there's that, but I'd recognize you in half a second :/
Magnus, do you speak German? That sounded good :)
I think you needed some age spots on your hands as well. I think your hands might give it away 😊
Kneebar was a dead giveaway 🤣
Lol I love that guy, “come on Fredrick, don’t be a pu**y” 😂
We would love to see you do more Crack Climbing maybe with the WideBoyz (;
Now… just wait 30 years and do it for real!😂
You gotta do one of these with some ninja warrior stuff where people might just believe you’re ridiculously strong from working in the trades for 60 years.
10:55 was hilarious
“Back in the days of your alpine 7c onsights” lmfao at this point he’s just fucking with you
Wait 40 years and we will see the REAL Magnus as a 70 yr old flashing 8c like a walk in the park!
Will Rungne be releasing this hat and coat soon? I also liked the more traditional look of the pants as well.
lmao, the beard not handling the climbing over the course of the video is hilarious.
Cheeky knee, good to see !
Love these.
The shaking 😂😂😂
would love to see a video where you do no ramp up so you go from failing a 5 and then climbing a 8A at different Gyms around the same city so you can see the genuine fear when an old fragile man starts on a really hard route as they try to yell at you to be careful and get down so you don't hurt yourself
Lmao he forgot to give Magnus chalk-  that’s hilarious
The teacher was so nice. He should get a raise.
Stop this clowning, and do normal climbing  videos...
Great video. Loved the shaking feet.
Lmao that was hilarious
Love these haha. The real effort is not the climbing, it’s the make up dedication hahah😂
you have an insane poker face
Fint könshår i ansiktet!
he rlly forgot the chalk smh
Any videos with Juji coming soon?
It’s like… Magnus and Wim Hof did fusion from DBZ.  I wasn’t ready for this
those screams took me out🤣🤣🤣
I love your videos but the problem is you’re just not that spectacular at acting so it makes it not very believable. And 73? No way do you look or seem 73. Keep practicing though! I still love the content!
Dude sounds like a fun guy. Great coach
How old are you? "73." bulllllllshiiiiiiii.... he 1000% knew right then. Maybe 54/57 would have been believable, changing your voice, going slower overall. You react so fast, that it makes you seem very young. You could try this again right now with some tweaks to make it good. Maybe not wear the most ridiculous outfit the whole time either looking like a Charles Dickens character.
The acting is so great. Fantastic job playing the part. Great video 👏
Maybe for the next “undercover” video, Magnus could pose as the camera guy (for another climber) and surprise everyone with his skills that way
Give him Oscar finally! That Elvis syndrome...! :D
I cannot get enough of these videos. Keep them up Magnus
He knew at the first sight
i haven't even started the video and i just have to say this is getting ridiculous lol what's next?
Fake af, thanks but u are still keeping the same storytelling( hi I’m a super nice and technical trainer )
This is very much like watching the show Nathan for you because it's all about how people know that something is wrong but they won't say anything.
I'm like "Did he not notice his hands without makeup?"
Can't believe they let you climb with your scarf!?
You looked more like a zombie than an old man.
You need something to obscure your fitness to make this at all believable. A fat suit, some jowel makeup, etc.
you can tell he knew
Loved this video. Really had me going when you hit him with the bowline.
@2:45, wow!  Even threw some tremors in there with your right hand.  Good acting!
You need to paint your body brown or black Magnus because anyone can recognize you
The beard falling off the entire video was my favorite part 😂. Great video as always!
Yesssss
His german swearing is on point too.
sheisse
the beard for me was the best climber, hanging in  there for so long
ungefähr 10 meter
magnus needs to have baggier pants his legs too buff when hes climbing even when trying to sell the sewing machine foot
wait til Magnus is an actual Old Man..  pretending to be a Young Man smashing all the other young men in the climbing gym..
It’s remarkable how visibly grimy every hold is
Magnus gonna be a great Old man
Not gonna lie Magnus, Frederick has swag. Nice jacket
This is getting old too fake
The German swearing and the screaming 😂😂😂
Its so obvious lol
Your voice is recognizable. Maybe be in the next Uncle Drew movie.  LOL
Lmao great video but a couple giveaways:  You didn’t age your hands  And a 73 year old probably wouldn’t be so quick to fist bump.
Today I learned that brits call whippers 'wangers'.
This makeup is so bad XDDD
What a good disguise! Your voice is pretty distinct though, which might be a bit of a giveaway
Fun.
Even though he knew early on, it was a banger of a video.   Just great content!
Your beard is falling off, he didn’t know.😂😂😂
Thought it was Jim Carey in the thumbnail
Magnus should go back here when he is actually 73 years old
Imagine an old man walk into your gym with a camera.. you punch him on his chest coz you know he’s probably an pro athlete.  HE DIES. 👀
You gotta find a way to hide the camera man and wear a bodycam.
i wonder why magnus wasn’t on the oscar nomination list this year… he’s a complete method actor 😂
every climber would recognize him or ?? my guess is old these dude have seen Magnus ?
LOL  BUT THE SCARF AND HAT IS TOO MUCH
and let´s see the 8c onsight!!!!
I smiled when I read the title of this video 😂before I watch I just know this is gonna be a good vid.
11:48 he almost got you 😂😂😂
Good video
lol
Magnus is actually a total beginner and pretends that he is a pro
When I worked as a bartender, I always looked at peoples hands to see the true age.
Okay Magnus, the step up from here is to do prosthetic makeup to completely disguise your facial features and embody an Uncle Boris 😆
That fake Elvis leg was emaculate
The music on the 5.14
Hahahah love this
Your German accent and swearing were excellent! 👍
hahah, this is climbing history in a great way, would have loved some pics of all the famous people mentiioned and the shoes!!! knots!!!first auto belay, and cimbing safety!!!!
"That's a very small rope" 😄 Reminds me of "Being There" Where Chauncey refers to the elevator as a "very small room".
He had no clue... Magnus is a genius!
This coach might not be using social media, but he's seen every climbing video on YouTube
Is not laughing part of his role as a German ?😅
You absolutely nailed the attitude of an old man, especially at 20:46 not laughing at all. Perfect execution Magnus haha.
Btw kudos to the coach, looks like a really smart lad that knows the discipline and how to explain it, he's the kind of guy I like to climb together with
Man I sure get a kick out of watching you and others climbing. I am too old and arthritic to even walk around the block but back in the 60s my friends and I were climbing fanatics. I am really impressed with the shoes you climbers wear these days. My first climbing shoes had a jute sole and the first pair that I owned with a rubber type sole I think were made by Asolo or perhaps Vasque. When we started out we made most of our gear. I made climbing harnesses for myself and all of my friends. We made climbing chocks by filing the threads out of machine nuts. The only real store bought gear we owned were our ropes and carabiners. I hope you age better than I have. Cheers from Canada. ~ulrich
The foot shaking is so relatable
Your acting is getting better! That was most entertaining. And he was such a good sport, keeping it going along. Great video.  Cheers!
Dette er moro Magnus 👍😀
More 😂
The instructor's attitude is just awesome, he's a great guy!
As a German its so funny hearing these german lines from Magnus 😂
That was great
That was really fun!
The inthusiasm the trainer has is infectious
Please shout out the Ukraine guy that came up with doing this concept in the gym.
At this point, whenever a weird guy/girl enters any gym in Europe with a cameraman behind them, asking for a beginner lesson, they are most certainly some manifestation of Magnus Mitdbo
Way to funny your old man straight face 🤣🤣 awesome video!!!!
I'm a 68 year old climber and even though I knew you were acting, I was still inspired :)
Dude yes. This is gold
You are a very bad actor. Why not just make some videos of you actually climbing hard routes? You don't always need the whole gambit thing. It's cute sometimes, but it was very obvious he knew exactly who you were.
This coach is awesome. So positive, supportive but also making sure he’s doing it correctly and safe. Honestly all the undercover coaches have been excellent but I think this guy is my favorite.
Everybody knows Magnus is a 1300 year alien-viking hybrid.
This time your pretend was a bit more convincing. The last time it wasn't.
"First you were a duck and then you were a chicken" that was adorable
next time you need to collab with pro climbers and send them in under disguise
Dang Magnus you fell off that last wall.... I've never seen you fall not on purpose.  Is their a video of you completing it?
Should have stuffed a pillow under his shirt and a few worts.
Magnus I really can't tell you how much I have come to love this series. Maybe you could start involving the staff but pranking the climbers so you are recognized less?
I love the thousand yard stare as the shots begin, or after someone makes a joke
"Scheiße. Verdammt!" hahahahha
The amount of knowledge this coach has is amazing. The names mentioned deserve a compilation here in the comment section
This is content gold. You've reached youtube mastery with these disguised videos. Keep them coming! Cheers from patagonia
Bro youre so good at making it seem like youre a beginner, with the shaking legs and all
I really wanted to see you onsite the 8b+ just to see what he said!
Lol😂 pretend to shake your hands…
The lil leg quiver 😂😂
Magnus should disguise himself as Anton.
cool video , no gym owner would never allow to lead for someone who is just a beginner. So my bet - the instructor is playing his role as well
If the beard was a bit better this would have been perfect
The screaming @15:40 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hell yeah, brother.
If anyone ever asks me to teach them to climb, I will assume they are Magnus until proven otherwise.
I think Magnus might actually speak German pretty well after hearing some of those... exclamations haha
Yoo Kieran what up! I knew it was gonna be a good vid when I saw ya! 🔥🔥
next episode: pro climer pretends to be nigerian
It's your jawline! It cuts right through every disguise you put on.  You should also put makeup on your hands, old people have old hands.
This coach definitely has his dream job
The feet trembling at 9:45 is oscar worthy
Magnus you’re actually ridiculously good at acting mate, got the mannerisms down pat! Good heavens
Next video magnus is going to acting classes to learn about pretending an old man for fooling people 🤣
Hahaha I hope Messner will see this! We need a colab of the old guys - big mountains you know 😂
Great video! 👍
Hahaha please never stop doing these disguise videos Magnus! Most entertaining videos on YouTube haha!!!!
In my gym there are a bunch of old men who really rock hard! The oldest one is 75 and climbs up to 7c
As a 66-year old codger, I couldn't stop laughing. This season I will have to try wearing the wool coat, hat and scarf on my 8b+ project. Not the big whips though!
I love it. His accent is so bad he sounds French. Perfect
Best one yet. Fredrich crushed it. Bjorn can only be jealous.
You can use makeup all you want, but hiding being jacked is more difficult.😀
He was smiling right at you after a minute. Three hours wasted lol.
The old man noises 😭spot on
Coming up: climbing in a fat suit
He doesn't move and sound like a 73 yr old.
You can't hide that jawline.
I want to meet with u!😅
Old Magnus looks like Magnus.
Ouh.. A shawl and thick sweater. Come on. Btw keep it up Magnus. Always love ur work.
Kinda funny you can start to see his beard come off more and more.
Needs some better beard glue 😂
Ah, Magnus, I’d watch you climb when you really are that old! Such a treat to watch so much fun developing, you’re a good sport for doing the whole makeup thing. Thank you so much for all you do, it’s appreciated! ❤️ from Canada
What you can do is actually tell the place what you're gonna do so they can assign you an older instructor. Probably wouldn't be as easy for him to notice something is off
12:58 „Scheiße verdammt!“ 😂 That did sound very convincingly German, nailed it!
I wish I could like this twice! something about the setup, the old man, the encouraging coach, amazing!
The one coach without social media also happens to be the coach with the most climbing history knowledge. Of course he recognized you! Haha!
I just found your channel "by classical youtube accident" and viewed a lot of your stuff, even I am not in anyway in climbing but your videos are very entertaining and I admire your physical strength and technique.  So, after this episode I am thinking who is the next "guest" in your channel - after we saw Björn and his German grandpa (they must be relatives, they look so similar 🤣😂) maybe his French aunt?
magnus should consider quitting climbing and becoming an actor, oh, my, god Trembling, chicken falling, hesitation to plug the rope, BREATH PLAY, calculated moans, voice tone, posture, fake accent, good choice of clothing and masking, the way he looks up and down after hearing about the new rope holder thats supposed to save you from breaking a leg, the way you get into character? Holy shit
You need a better make up artist, Magnus! If you told me you were 73, I'd have known immediately I was a part of a prank video. The coach was a good sport though.
That beard is so gross lol
Holy shit Magnus, how are you managing to sound that much like a German old man Your swearing and accent are just extremely great   Great video :D
Thanks magnus for introducing me to climbing. It has really helped my frisbeegolf actually.
I think 73 was just a little too high, i think saying even 68 would be more believable
15:36 more screaming :) :)
To be fair, klettersteig is not ment to be hard. A decent gym climber can climb a hard E section in klettersteig. I think the hour long pitches is what makes it hard. I do it for the scenery and getting to places normal hikes don’t come
Great climber but would probably flunk spy school 😂 This one looked like Magnus Midtbø going in disguised as Magnus Midtbø wearing a hat.
Lol
I’m get so hype when I see you drop a new video
This channel is going to become a chronicle of Magnus' transformation into an international man of mystery and master of disguise
Nice video but why you didn’t brought your shoes with you to do the last route. I really would have loved to see you beating it
Anybody else see the figure eight he tied
Promouncing Gülich as Gülik gives away that you are not german :P
I think you have an acting career ahead of you. 👍
Next time go dressed as Dolly Parton! ♡
zu, zu, scheisse. alllllmost made it believable ;)
Rope and a scarf?!  Love the videos. 😂
LMAO the typewriter leg shake was great
Haha 12:58: "Scheiße, verdammt"😁😂
The intentional loud footwork is incredible 😂😂😂
🎞📽🎬🔬🤟📈
Did you learn german before this video 😂 it was really authentic 👍🏽
Its harder for magnus to pretend to not climb well than to just climb well lol.
I loved the trash talk about via ferrata ahhaah
This was an amazing video wearing the jacket,scarf and hat is such a funny idea I laughed for 20 minutes straight when he is testing his strength he knows he has some power
Next time we need disguised Magnus being taught how to crack climb
your hands dude!! wheres your liver spots!?
when u make a similar video and at the point when u trying rly hard can u  scream MADAFAKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA? PLEASE
As a german myself, i must say that your german accent is on point :D
Butt like a melon, Fingers like a Gorilla, that scarf and Cappy in a climbing gym… not sus at all 😄
“How fake do you want this to be?”
Absolute good acting
The sewing machine legs was absolutely Hillarious.
The makeup was a bit much. Guessing he figured you out right away with the Via  Ferrata bit. Nice effort. Always enjoy watching things like this. Fun. 😁
man I wonder why this old man has a massive back
I hope I take care enough of my body so I'm not like Frederick falling on 5.14 when I'm 73, Frederick you POS!
very hot dog hans
Another awesome disguise video Magnus!  Loved the big falls and the coach being fun about them.  I think you may have given yourself away earlier on the orange overhang where you managed to get back to the wall a couple times.  I don't think a 70 year olds legs could move like that haha.  Great video as always!
I’d love to see a heart rate monitor on the coach as you struggled with those low clips 😂
I really hope you did another video with him, just you two climbing,  he is amazing!
I'm at about 2/3 of the vid and I'm afraid the deteriorating beard gives it away...
Amazing video ❤, next time maybe stronger glue for the beard 😅🤣
Amazing
Magnus could easily change career path to becoming an actor at this point, the leg trembles were a nice touch!
Hi I’m Magnus Midtbo, welcome to jackass
Depot Sheffield is the best place for bouldering
His biggest mistake was saying he was 73 😂 I mean look at his hands! Could have easily said 50’s and been fine. But then I guess it wouldn’t have been so awesome to see him climb the way he did!
Magnus is a little too good at actung
love watching these types of videos and can't wait to see what other disguises you come up with!
This is the greatest video i have seen in my life
19:28 jajajajaa
As a german, I like your little sprinkles of german here and there :D you nailed the ungefähr almost perfectly :P But you can hear you ain't from germany if you are native :x Still, your videos are so amazing, keep it up man! :3
Alex Honnold should do this and free solo and indoor wall and clip only the top one to get down
This guy's way too loose belaying a senior citizen lol. Unless he knows what's up
"first you were a duck and then you were a chicken"
At this point any of them could be Magnus. I just dont know anymore
eyebrows should've been done darker, Magnus. That's something what catches your recognition - blonde eyebrows. Plus the beard was weirdly scruffy :P
The guy would have to be 70 years, blind, deaf and demented not to recognize Magnus in that costume.
impersonating some one not you age is very hard, the voice, the hands and the way you move among other things require alot of make up and preparation
Telling Magnus first you were a duck then you were a chicken, then that is a major wanger (that's what she said) 🤣 great job coach loved it
Lowkey kinda early a little kinda
Alright, we need to photoshop Magnus in as many ways as possible, collage them together, and distribute them to as many gyms as possible...
What kind of instructor lets a guy climb with a scarf around his neck?
Please do this video again when you'll be 73
As a German I can say that you kinda nailed the german comments, best part was "sch*iße verdammt" xD
gonna have to step up the costume game there magnus
cool
i love the lore that's being built here
This guy knew too much climbing history/people, of course he knows mangus. Need to do it with people that are not climbing historians.
“1st you were a duck then you were a chicken”
im blown away by Magnus' ability to not only climb but act like he's forgotten to climb!!!
Loved the video!   Great fun!
I'm impressed with climbing those while wrapped in wool !
This was the most enjoyable of them all I think
Old man magnus forget about chalk
Magnus can you do a Magnus Carlsen pull-up?! 👏
These videos are great because it's going to be funny seeing magnus think he's fooling the person when he's not or the better outcome they don't know who he is. Either way the video is good
Kannst du echt deutsch sprechen? 😳
This German accent is epic! :D
Wake up babe, new Magnus video just dropped
In love with Magnus randomly throwing in German words to really seal the deal
that instructor was a great sport. it's one thing to be a great belayer (really soft catches for someone deliberately taking monster whippers), but another thing to be roleplaying along the whole time
I don't want to look mean, but there's no way in hell the dude didn't know it was you from the get go. He has vast knowledge of climbing and your make-up looks like shit lmao. In no way, shape or form it's somewhat realistic, the beard is clearly fake and it's dropping out. The skin is also really uber fake, the color and texture are really off. I'd recommend a better make-up technique like in "Bad Grandpa" and something like that.
Instructor is a great guy. 🤝
Love seeing a dude whose free soloed Yosemite with Alex convince people he’s scared of a 30 foot indoor wall, never not hilarious
Even if the kid was buying it, I feel like saying 70 was a bit of a stretch lol
this is way more plausible than a beginner climber just picking up a v7 casually tho.
I dont want to be that guy but I had the feeling he instantly knew who you are. I mean who would call an old man "dont be a little pussy"?
I think from the beginnig :D He was just smiling that way. ;)
Your German accent is hilarious Magnus 😂
One time at the crag, a 70 year old couple cruised up a route that I can't even climb yet. It was their warmup! I want to be like that athletic when I'm that age! (I want to be that athletic now, lol!)
You should use contact lenses, that will make you totally different
We really changed the route difficulty scale in the US? Jeez as if us not using the metric system wasn't enough 😒
Hw seemed like an awesome coach!!!! loved it...
I imagine after a life of doing this he'd be quite healthy and he'll be able to actually go to these places as a 70yo man and shock everyone for real 🤣
love it!
If Magnus wasn't my favourite youtuber before, he is now
Good try attempting to fool someone working at one of the spiritual homes of British climbing. 😅
your german words inbetween are so fun for a german-speaker like me haha - "ungefähr" and "oder?" are so perfectly placed that I now believe you're german :D
Hahaha dang, these videos will never get old, 10/10!
I loved when you so casually said "73" years old. 🤣
You sounds like a French... Haha, but good one!
Video idea: you should do a forfeit challenge with another pro. Take turns to pick a boulder, if anyone drops it they pick a forfeit out of a hat.
Pro Climber does the same video over and over again...:D
I lost it when he suggested you to do the 8b before you die from old age
OMG KIERAN SUCH A LEGEND
Next time you're in Yourkshire can you please collab with Nile Wilson squad! I'd love to see them on a wall, and I'm sure they'd be happy  to teach you a thing or two at their kind of a gym 😄
You should put your old guy outfit onto Rungne. I mean if you can onsight a 7c+ in it, it must be very functional, and it looks comfortable!
I freaking love when you do these videos and this one is definitely the best so far 🤙
come to canada you'll fool everyone :D lol
Love your videos
he had crazy knowledge of all the climbers too. true student of the sport
this is amazing. that guy was so nice
Keiran!! Sometimes he coaches me, he’s great 👍
The beard coming off was hilarious
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOUR NEXT VID LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
You're going to give someone a heart attack Magnus 🤣
I've been really surprised a couple of times in the gym by older folks and overweight/out of shape looking people who really crush. It's extremely impressive to see humbling that I have a long way to go! And also no excuse 😅
Has anyone ever called you, Vegetable Lasagna?
Wow what a great and knowledgable instructor, the guy is just pure positivity and support.
"I guess when you're old, you have less to live for" - the zoom into Magnus' sad face and the coaches reply just cracked me up!
Great one again. Had a good laugh. I just wish you would do a few minutes interview with the instructors afterwards. About climbing and their personas if they want to.
“you know yogurt?”
Truly a Bjorn again climber. Bjorn to be wild? From dusk til Bjorn? I'll see myself out.
I saw the Bjorn videos about a month ago. Then kept watching more. Magnus, you inspired me to try climbing, and now i've been going to a gym every other day for 2 weeks now. It's all I want to do. So thank you so much!
the one day i decide to skip out on going to the foundry bc my head hurts 😭
love the german words you threw in to make it more convincing "ungefähr", "oder", "scheiße" and "verdammt" also the accent was pretty good the vid was ofcourse entertaining as always :)
The shaking absolutely kills me everytime
Now try to wear fat suit ! It will be interesing :P
Nice try Magnus your just getting to well known being famous does have its down sides. Climb safe old man.
The meme potential in this episode is OFF THE SCALE
Frederick! LOL
Aaaaaargh the leg shaking 😝😝😝
its the eyes and his smile i dont think it matters wut he does he cant hide those
im impressed at the random german words in there he been practicing that cover a lot huh ? XD the german was pretty good overall i would like to see more agression int he pronounciation the scheiße was a little damp like didnt sound german we germans have a ear for hearing german you know xd been trained to understand that my entire life
Magnus, I know this would be hard but can Bjorn and ol' Fred make screen appearance at the same time? XD
Nice, every day you release one of these videos you get closer to where I climb!
Stick to your day job, acting is not for you.Hollywood is safe :-) If the gym guy didn't realise what was going on he needs to have his eyes examined. I have watched most of your videos but I think this one is the worst. Didn't bother to watch it to the end.
As a German... Magnus german comments were the best. So funny 🤣
You'll do the same video in 50 years, but whithout make up
As a climber from Frankenjura myself, it was so cool hearing Magnus talk about it! And the way he talked about it (bolts often placed far apart, etc.), he definitely knows it from experience
massive props to the guy who played along. he made this video 10 times better
That screaming was abit to much :) but it was funny
U could look way older with a subtle makeup
Still wearing the bouldering came first shirt even after fredrick completely roasts bouldering 😂
12:55 sheisse verdammt ahahahaha xD this guy plays his role so well !!
You sell it so well with the shaky legs 😂
Magnus broken German has to be the highlight for everyone from Germany. 😂
As a German I can confidently say Magnus nailed the German-ish Accent! Too good hahahhaa
aw i love the foundry so much
The Norwegian yeah, or Yat can give anyone away
Magnus ich liebe dein Deutsch. Haha you're such a legend 💚
This was awesome.  Especially to see a climbing gym I've actually climbed in myself, nowhere near the 7 grade level though!
This is not fun anymore . The strongman . The skater and several other types of sports ? this is just not fun ... It obviously that he knows who you are . make it more subtile for god sake
that guy is a legend
For those who don't know he actually spoke bit german in this video
JOSH RUNDLE???????
Haha great being reverse trolled by such a lovely coach
Bro  Your get noticed because you still look like Magnus 😂
When I worked as a climbing instructor 10 years ago, I use to have a pair of old ladies (I believe in their 70s) come in and climb together. It was fun to watch because they were very good and had extremely solid 3 point technique. They weren’t the fastest, but could climb most routes in the gym no problem.
omg i literally suggested to do ''old man'' disguise in the previous video and 2 days later you do it. I know this was filmed long before, but I will still take the credit for idea of this :D amazing video, love it!
How hard is it to climb while pretending its hard to climb? :D
Lowkey flickering between the scandinavian and german accent. Luckily, loads of English mistake the danish/norwegian accent for dutch/german lmao.
Are you in the UK!?! Climb with us @clmbxr
If I can add any critique, I feel like a weakness in these disguises is that Magnus can’t quite commit to a choice between being strong with bad technique or weak with good/mixed technique. 73 year old school climber with terrible footwork and bent arms who nonetheless moves like he’s limber, cuts feet and does clumsy campusing? The older guys I’ve climbed with all have pretty solid technique and try to climb as statically as possible, avoiding strengthy moves. Would’ve made sense for this guy to be decent but appear at first to have a limited range of movement and to move slowly and cautiously—and then just amazingly make that work on ridiculous grades.
Oh god yes it’s back
Coulda said water, but no. Yogurt.
Magnus: we looked for an instructor without social media The instructor: knows more about climbing history and famous climbers than 90% of the climbing community
He’s a cool coach, awesome how he played along 😂
Next video you should invite another climber to also pretend to be an old man with you 😂😂😂
Despite some serious injuries to my spine and other bones over the years, this channel alone has got me really into bouldering. It's incredibly painful at times but I'm persevering and really enjoying it. Managed my first V4 today and it was an incredible feeling. Thank you Magnus!
Love your videos! You must try out doing aerials sometime, especially aerial silks! I would love to see how your grip strength and body awareness can help you to succeed in the skill
I've actually met an old man that calls these "pussy walls" and wishes young climbers would just go climb actual cliff faces. He constantly tells stories about climbing mountains, and even has one about climbing up a burning building to help retrieve a person's child from the 17th floor. All in all, you nailed the performance.
I love how Magnus is taking climbing into the 21st century and making it more entertaining, i'm only 14 and have never climbed but after watching him I really want to try. Though i always wondered, with all the risks of injury or even death why do people free-solo ???
Throwing in those German words makes you sound just like my grandpa when he is cursing and slips back to German.
You know, now you're going to have to go back when you're in your 60's to do that wall...... :poke:
Old man goes free soloing with Alex?
Holy moly that spotty loose-hanging beard 😂 and the German swearing as you fell, really selling the disguise.
I think we need a massive beard and suit that makes you look 100 pounds heavier
I was there when they were filming this, I was fingerboarding upstairs for most of it. I could only really hear Kieran's side of the conversation, and it was a bit weird seeing an old man punting up the 5 in the corner whilst being filmed and wearing a swanky Mammut harness. I was a little more confused when he took a flier off the pink and then didn't crap himself. Finally worked out what was going on when he flashed the 7c+.
That coach is just amazingly nice and knowledgeable!    And that beard is peeling off by the minute 😃
dude the beard is not the best 😅
The fricken coat and scarf :DDDD
"ungefähr 10 meters"
The fake beard is obvious tho lol
I guess you've got to act like a blind person now and have them call out the holds for you.  There is only one other route to take to disguise yourself but it is frowned upon nowadays.
8:11 bro casted a spell 🤣
That was a great video.
would have been funny to fail at every easy route and then tell him that you have to go and take your steroids=)) then come back at full rage mode and tell him "GIVE ME THE HARDEST ROUTE IN HERE" and easy flash it
The hardest part about acting old is the maturity of the voice, and it can't be faked. It's why certain parts for Wagner's ring opera can't even be auditioned for without being at least 40 yrs old. That would've been my first clue is his voice just doesn't sound old. But the rest was spot on
Had so good fun watching this! I loved your foodwork! :D Thanks!
73 yea right, the coach could tell it was not true maybe 60 will have been more believable
Hey Kieran 😃👍🏼  Greatings from Chris vd V, Anna Maura, Sietse and Chris v E.the netherlands We met you in Ceuse. Keep Crushing 💪🏼😃🧗🏼‍♂️  Awesome to see you smile and enjoy so much!  And thanks to Magnus for making this video with Josh and Kieran.  Enjoy life! 🥳🧗🏼‍♂️
As a German myself I have to admit that you really nailed playing the role of a German old man with the way you behaved and the way you talked. :D
Gutes deutsch Frederik! "Scheisse verdammt!"🤣
I love that "Are you sure about that?"
You won my subscription man, keep it up
I love how along with his climbing, his clipping gets slowly more skillful. Wonderful acting!
Silly Irishman thinking he's 70
The Irish will fuck with ya if ya fuck with them and it’s out of love
(magnus) " and now i must take my shirt off like we used to do in freezing cold german winter climbing mountains" (ripped young body and old man face)  (coach) "there is something not right here"
21:17 you defied gravity for a second I think
great video... laughing all the way through 😂😂😂😂😂
Magnus’ ability to pretend he can’t climb surprises me every time!
I never knew Linus Tech Tips was a climber.
I'm more impressed by his German accent then his climbing. Spot on!
Three hours makeup, to look just like...  Magnus. 😂
He's so supportive and cool though ❤️
you absolutely nailed the German personality!
Nice stuff grandpa of magnus. Pls tell magnus, i want to see more lead climbing. Thanks.  Good performance at your age!
9:31 I love how the leg shaking instantly changes from left to right 😆
keiran's my coach and i had a session with him later this day, he said the moment you walked through the door he knew who you were. thanks for the beta on my project though!
This is amazing this is my home city!!! This place is great
This was fantastic, I love these disguised climbing videos. The fact that Kieran worked it out was hilarious, and Josh's old man digs were great 😂 top work
'First you were duck, then you were a chicken' 😂
Love these videos!! hahahahahah
This series is so freaking fun
Absolutely hilarious video, the best laugh I've had in a while. Brilliant content mate, keep up the good work!
hahaha I lost it at 15:35 when you started screaming xD
Magnus you should go to extremely sandbagged gyms and the opposite, and decide how accurate the grades are! I have one in mind! Lol
Magnus hearing to not cut feet…🕺
"before you die" hahaha fucking lost it
For me as a German this was really funny. Well played Magnus
"Scheiße verdammt" - Magnus 2023
When it comes to naming videos dont forget that your own name has power in the algorithm. Dont be afraid to try it sometime. Wonderful video
Within two hours
This was very funny and entertaining.
16:00 "oh yeh I forgot to give u the chalk" hes gotta know by that point....
73 was a little too much lol... maybe 60ish would be abit more believable
Before you die was the funniest moment ever😂! I don't know how macnus dindt laugh
i wish i knew you were in Sheffield, would have been so cool to meet you
For some reason the previous disguise was more successful. 😂 I think the black hair sold it better last time. Good luck for the next one though.
🗽You can recognize Magnus by the voice very easily! ☝ .
I want to see if you can get into a pro event dressed up as someone else
"Before you die" Josh was really letting lose there. What an awesome video
19:32 🤣🤣💀
I laughed thru out the hole video…
"Scheiße! Verdammt!" 😂
When you pretend to be old climber from Germany but the young guy from USA knows everything about history of European climbing.
I like these videos :)  Good stuff
is it time to invest in some prosthetics and body suits in order to expand the bjorn cinematic universe?
wait what is magnus doing in Sheffield? I'm at that gym 4 times a week :P
beard looked kinda fake, and u can struggle that much on the lower ones cause it gets obvious when u flash a hard route
That beard was terrible. Lol.
oh magnus this looks like an absolute blast to watch lmao. im heading to bed tho, so i will come back to it later! already excited hahaha
he really lays it on thick and its hilarious
"Back in the day of your alpine 7c+ onsights" 😂😂
i think you might need to fly to madagascar to do these videos lol
At this rate, we'll soon see Magnus doing Hamlet
"but Gullich was better, no?" 😂😂😂😂
ayo now that you collabed with josh you need to collab with louis parkinson 😤
This series introduced me to Magnus and climbing. I’ve only played American football and basketball but I’m thinking about trying climbing
The german accent of Magnus is underrated
This was so much fun to watch! Kieran leaning into the gag instead of calling you out right away was super cool on his part.
Its so nice to see that Magnus attemps to be more authentic with using German words like "oder" or "ungefähr". Nice Video and keep it up
That disguise aint fooling anyone lol
Midway through beard turning into loose pubes 😄 And really appreciate the guy playing along, having fun not faking his reactions. Really entertaining!
That old man Ondra scream will be scary AF after hearing Magnus in his 70s!! 🤣😆😂
Next video of this kind you gotta watch out for magnus in a wig
😅 that would have been quite the slam for an old man @ 10:00 if you fell before clipping in. If I was the instructor I would have been so nervous 🤣
As a german, it was SO FUNNY to see how good your interpretation of the old german man was xD. I didnt even know that you can speak it :D Well done m8!
Can't even describe the anxiety Fredrick gave me shaking up the wall taking forever to clip in 😅🙈
"Before you die" killed me 😂
Bad actor
Very elaborate con Magnus and well done!  I'm thinking there might be a  future in this for you if the you tube thing doesn't work out.
Hahahaha. Good one.
One look at your hands or neck and he knows you are definitely not 73 yo :D
Love these
Not a fan of these.
As a German, who studies in another country and frequently has to recognise other Germans based off accent alone, this is hilarious, because Frederick does not sound German at all to me
The coach was awesome
A lot of people in the comments say that you made them try climbing, me included. I'd love to see a poll of how many people tried/started climbing because of your videos. Love the disguised pro climber videos!
This is hilarious! Just started watching it, and I'm already laughing out loud! That accent!!!
Never been into climbing growing up but this has so quickly become my favorite YouTube channel. I’m soooo invested!
I do that with water on my hands . never ciose close to getting that much yogurt on my hands lol
Magnus, no one is fooled by this. Stop doing it. It's embarrassing.
The voice has to be the most difficult one to alter. Magnus has a voice thats I recognize pretty easy.
How does u climbing with a scarf doesn’t raise suspicion
Blast from the past, with the lead climbing. Love it.  Hope to see more in the future.
I loved the German accent 😂
a+ for actiing Magnus
Why no sub 😭
13:40 really smart thing to say! As we age much of our muscle mass tends to decrease but grip is one of the only things we can constantly progress as we age
One big problem; you don't feel a constant pain in most of your joints so your movements are not authentic. Next time you try something like this, at least put on some straps above and below all of your joints and tighten them as hell :D or at least, practice like that
Magnus, great old German guy! 😂 The „verdammte scheiße“ was very well pronounced! Greetings from Berlin.
5:15 *John Cena tears through the screen*
I absoulutely love these videos, so hilarious
These videos never fail to give me a good lmao kinda laugh
Magnus trying to thumb war the crimp test 😂
This is what we used in Normandy.
Channeling your inner Fredrik, love it!
Your english sounds really like german. Well done
Watching someone climb on 2x speed is hilarious
Ja okey 😂
Effing beard coming off towards the end lol
"How'd you find out?" asks Magnus with his fake beard falling off. 😂
I think he should have gone in guns blazing, old man strength style
15:55 his beard is weird
The chalk obsession is the give away.
That instructor was hilarious
who wears a scarf while climbing, that can get tangled either on the rope or on the feet, be in the way or get trapped and in case of fall hang  the climber, baaaaad idea. Is like my kid is waiting at the red light and someone else just passes... and my kid says "huh!? why are we waiting ?"
Hey I'm just an old man and I come with my camera man casually here yo try climbing. Sureee it's all casual and normal.
i still think the first trainer was the best teacher
I think the coach knew after "Fredreick" said he didn't know what campusing is.
That leg shake deserves an oscar
15:07 i thought my phone screen rotated
He seems so sweet
Dang, in the rental shoes too haha!
Take that Bjorn you piece of …. 😂😂😂😂
The instructor was super enthusiastic and professional, very cool video. However, you still look a lot like yourself, but if you was 70 years old 😅
Your acting is getting better Magnus. :)
if you ever have grandkids, youll be ready for the role of grandpa
Absolute perfect grandpa play. The scarf and hat were just icing on the cake with your mannerism and demeanor. I was crying in laughter 😂😂 great job.   Vet ikke om du leser kommentarer men så på deg når du konkurrerte også.
LOL the instructor at the end is totally hilarious egging him on to try the hardest route 🤣🤣🤣
The disguise might have worked if Magnus didn't have one of the most famous faces in rock climbing. In any case, his performance was still great.
when he said 73 i fucking lost it hahahha. he should have gone with 60 or something, the eay the guy looked at him when he said 73 was the end of the gag imo lmao
The bowline and using hiking boots are such great details on selling it
I am impresses of how good he is in not trying to be good 😅 climbs like true beginner 😄
Terrible disguise 😅
I don't love the premise of tricking people, but I do love seeing these really positive, encouraging coaches who are good at what they do.  It makes a huge difference in whether people continue to try something, if they had a good first experience!  As did Tristan, Kieran stole the show!
Next video title: “I pretended to be an actor and landed a major Hollywood production” Fun video!
Magnus throwing in the little german words makes this so much better. But I have almost never seen a veteran climber with bad foot work, so I think it wouldnt have been necessary to fake bad foot placement. Most of the time they use their feet so much more and much more elegantly than younger climbers
I love how you threw these German words in there like "zu" before the fall or "verdammte scheiße" after you fell. I don't think you were that convincingly old but a pretty good German
6:04 Wow he even mimicked that subconcious 'genau' which we Germans do a lot when talking english. It means something like 'yeah right'. Nice detail.
I love you Magnus
I really enjoy your videos, but for some reason I'm really appalled by this pretend series. I just don't find it interesting enough to watch.
I'd also love to see Björns overweight brother, aka Magnus in a weight west and fatsuit try bouldering/climbing! I think it might actually be nice for a lot of people to see a realistic depiction of how a first time climbing session looks like for people who aren't physically fit yet. Also, it would be funny to see you climbing with 1.5 or 2 times your bodyweight!
OK magnus
the leg shaking is priceless
When he mentioned he was climbing without chalk... my mind exploded
First you are a duck then you are a chicken 😂😂
Bretty good climber …
Where is this I’ve been two a couple places in Sheffield but I don’t recognise this.
You should do this series but get other really strong climbers in disguise so they're less recognisable
You are just an absolute Beast Magnus xD So hard to act as an old guy when you are that good.
amazing
THE BEARD FALLING OFF HAH
Turns out I climb lead like a 72 year old grandpa just getting back into it, on top rope bring on the 6c's, on lead bring on those 6a Elvis legs and t-rex arms
Genius 🙌🔥
8:12 LOOOOL
I went climbing for the first time today its so fun if your on the fence do it its totally worth it
Oh
if climbing doesn't work out you've always got acting in the bag
You didn't fake the hands to be old, right? Super entertaining video xD
I love these videos. I know they must be difficult to make but the whole “undercover boss” vibe is so fun. And who knew Magnus was such a skilled actor?!?
Magnus is my dad
At what point does he have to remove the scarf and hat?
Why’s magnus actually such a good actor though like if I didn’t know that was magnus I never would’ve guessed that this old man wasn’t all that old. He really channeled that old man energy.
Need to black up a bit 😅
One of my favorite Tubers is a 150 year old Canadian sasquatch who climbs all over unsafe mines.
Magnus mimicking having shaky legs on the wall felt a bit personal
Amazing video as always Magnus. Thank you for getting me through some tough times with the joy and inspiration you bring from these videos.
I love how he just accidentally started tying the figure eight, realized mid-convo that he isn't supposed to, and unties it to go back to the other knot. What a legend 11:51
He knew from the first minute 😆
You should have pretended to be your father. That would have worked.
Lord this is getting complicated
As a german i can say that i have never seen a german old man in a climbing hall 🤣
Please more of that 🤣👏👏👏
i love this series
Really enjoyable Video! ☺️ Gettings from Germany ✌️
Haha, nice try ;-) Maybe wear a turtle neck to hide your youthfulness instead of a scarf that'll unfold. Also the glued on beard was too obvious. Better to just dye your own beard and hair the same colour. A couple more ideas: coloured contact lenses, fake dadbod, henna face/neck tattoo, 80's style frame eyeglasses, restrictive compression clothing. Comment ideas below 😅
GENAU haha
"Take that, Frederick! You piece of shit!"
Yes another one!!!
H is german accent is also spot on !
Imagine being so good climbing you can pretend to be old and shake like a leaf
Gutted .. my 6 year old daughter watches all your videos and we have been in Yorkshire the past few weeks as my mum is unfortunately seriously ill in Pinderfields hospital. We have tried to make Sheffield a number of times so my daughter could get some climbing in! It would have made her absolute year to have bumped into you.  She has had a rough time with family illness recently and would have been a great boost. Love the video as always and crazy that you've been in Yorkshire lol .. any plans to come to the Northeast? Durham or Newcastle area?
Magnus you need to lose 15kg of muscle before your disguise is believable!
Nice educational content
I love u bro
I'm really enjoying watching those Kinde of videos keep on doing  them and all the rest you are very inspiring
8:25 First, you were a duck and then you're chicken haha
Great video! Would be cool to have subtitles though :)
"Back in the days of your alpine 7c+ onsights" hahah
Fuck I was waiting for another one of these, not to bash but you need a better 'make up person' for these. I really hope you continue these but for the great acting skills you seemed to show in the first, U need as good of a make up artist that can put some realistic stuff on your face.
bro the leg shake had me dying lol
Damn I was waiting for another one if these 🎉
Good stuff
NOOO HE DIDNT😭😭😭😭
As a German I love it when he adds german words to his sentences like "ungefähr" at 7:13 wich means its about that height for those that don't know
Magnus just sounds too much like Magnus! His speech patterns give him away. Maybe I've just watched too many Magnus videos! ☺️
Love your vids, but to pretend effectively, being an old man, You got to go full skin cover, like neck and hands, and bold wrinkled head. Otherwise, your hands gave away your cover immediately.
Aww you even learned some german words. :D Weiter so Magnus!
Magnus ze Aktorr xD doing great! gonna pursue a career in acting next? hahahha <3 love the vid!
the guy definitely knew what's up as soon as he saw you unclip the rope
havent finished the video yet but it looks pretty obvious that theres something sketchy going on with the grandpa.. so he might have some clue 😂
you should do a series where you teach subscribers!
The climbing community is so cool and helpful. Shoutout.
Always funny, and your "denglisch" was on point ;)
Wait lol the screaming too 🤣
Great. You played the character in a very funny way. The disguise was just who magnus lookes when he is old. In the last video with the neard black glasses, it was much simpler was more disguised. Anyway had to laugh . thanks
At this rate Magnus has to disguise as Martne
What about disguising yourself as Magnus, pretending to be really good, but whiffing all the time!
Disliking cuz the shirt stayed on. Jk jk this video brought me so much joy
“You don’t look that different” haha
How could you tell? Magnus Midtbo looking like someone glued lint to his face.
Yes obviously love these videos!!! Thanks Edit: yes I was def watching thinking he knows.... lol 😆
It was hilariously obvious how unfooled this guy was. I think these disguise videos are at an end :) Entertaining though.
such a fantastic video,, and what a great lad keeping the banter up the whole way!
I wonder if they remembered to put makeup in his hands. Old people’s hands usually have a bunch of spots and wrinkles and veins.
5/5! Such entertainment! 😂👏🏼👏🏼
Next Video: Björn and Fredrick climb together and hate each other
I absolutely LOVE these disguised climbing vids, and your acting gets better every time, LOL!   Thanks for the varied and amazing content Magnus, your channel is my favorite not only for the entertainment but for the fact you single handedly got me off my lazy ass and into climbing! Into week 3 and loving every day of it. Not only has your passion for climbing and sharing of the sport gotten me into the gym and having the time of my life, but it has had the butterfly effect of causing me to want to be more conscious and healthy in my daily life simply because it'll help me on the wall!   Nothing but love from SLC, Utah, Magnus! Keep going!
Omg, I've just realised this is the first video from the monumental Sheffield series. I'm looking forward to seeing videos with Adam and the wide Boyz!
9:23 shaking kills me 🤣
boring. could be 5 minutes. watched 30 seconds
i love these videos do more
Love to see u in my home lead gym and heard u were with ondra
Nice touch using a bowline to tie into the harness!
Josh at 0:34 looks JUSTTTT like Wren from Corridor Digital 😂
Was great to collab with you Magnus! Nice to see you can still climb 7c+ when you're 73
Kieran seems to be a proper good guy
Priceless, absolutely priceless.
I'm sorry your makeup to transform you is awful. Are makeup artists that bad outside of the US?
I've watched approximately 30 seconds and I already love it. Keep up the good work!
Lol the shaking 🤣
He let you climb with a scarf?
going in 2023 climbing bc of your channel, ty!
😂😂😂😂😂❤
Reminded me of that one time I was clmbing at two really old men showed up. Their gear looked like it was over 20 years old, even the rope had already seen it's best times.  I wondered if I should say something, because from my POV this was really risky.  But when he started climbing I felt like a fool. Yes he wasn't the fastest but oh man that old man made the 6a i really struggled with before look easy. When we both reached the top we had a talk:  - Turns out he was 82 years old and came from Saxon Switzerland. He had been climbing for nearly 60 years.   Insane respect for that man, I hope I'm at least half as fit when I reach that age.
Yeah…. Looked like an old man 👀
"ach scheiße verdammt"
Hilarious, pretty good. You should make more videos of this kind.
Just had some really good soup, perfect video to watch to go into a food coma
I'm 55, and went to a climbing gym last month for the first time. Now I'm a bit dissappointed that I didn't climb at this level. :)
This reminds me of Uncle Drew for basketball lol
From the days of Jackass and on, "Old Man accomplishes X feat" is always a favorite of mine. Magnus - I think your next video needs to be outside of the climbing world - folks know your fact too well! Brilliantly done, as always.
Nice German accent Magnus :)
you are having way too much fun with this. it's hilarious!
“Are you sure about that?” Concerned about the auto-belay, little did coach know that the man has the most auto-belays in all of Norway
genau :D
Him playing along made it so much better too as it went on!😄
That leg shake at 9:30 had me crying, really good acting Magnus!
Really impressed by this coach, very encouraging and patient, and really knowledgeable about the history of climbing, damn. I feel like he got slightly suspicious when grandpa didn't clip and he said "you charged past the people I teach" lol
I do the inverse, im a (somewhat) younger man and I climb like a grandpa.
I climb with the exact same outfit
YES! A bowline to tie in!
from bottom of my heart ❤
this was great, you need to do some more undercover videos.
All the teacher he got so far were pretty good.
Kieran was awesome. Love how gung ho he was, didn't hold back at all with tips and encouragement for poor old Frederik
Damn magnus can speak good german
hahaha you savage, you always manage to prank the nicest bloody instructors ;D
Hi magnus 👋🏻
i was deprest before i started watching you then i started  climbing and now im the best version of myself so tankyou so much
the coach is such a good sport ! lovely video
"zu" and "scheisse" - nailed it
Really loves these, even when someone figures it out. Keep up the good work!
I have never met a 70 year old german who speaks english so well 😂
You can tell how much time and effort he spends on the videos
the begginer shaking on the legs its just too accurate
Why can you do the German accent that well?
Love the style :)
😆 and he still climbed with a coat, scarf and hat on the entire time!
I’m an instructor in NY and part of me is dreaming the the Bjorn Cinematic Universe makes it to my gym someday 😂
Your acting is so good I was feeling proper sad for the old man with the Elvis leg(s) 🤣🤣🤣
as a german myself, you have a better german accent than me haha
When the coach joined in with the old man hype and shouted "don't be a pussy" I cracked up.
Who’s this old guy? I came here to watch Magnus!
2:57 "very short rope isn't it?"  😂
i love this so much😂😂
Hmm, they let you climb with a rope around your neck?
give him rugne gift cards. such a cool dude.
haha that was great
Good acting, let down by poor makeup.
More of this lmao, you can still get away with it
That coach is great and very enthused with climbing. Knows everything about its history
Man how did Magnus not burst out laughing that guy was hilarious haha
Soon when anyone walks into any climbing gym, everyone is going to think you are magnus in disguise because of how many different disguises he's worn now.
magnus looking worse than gary in team america after getting his undercover job
The instructor was great and he knew so damn much
Stare
All things considered its great to see an instructor that isnt absolutely clueless
Jajaja fake shaking legs,  so nice video Magnus,  thanks for that!
Come on!)))) Who goes climbing (or do any indoor sports ) wearing hat and scarf?))) This is screaming like a prank:)
The amount of excitement I get when I see a new video posted from Magnus is immeasurable. Thanks for the laughs Magnus!
Your german accent was on point haha 😂😂 "Verdammte Scheiße" and all the "Ja's" between your sentences.😄
I think it would be a long-term goal to build a structure of gym climbing but with a friend
omg ive been to this climbing centre everyone is so friendly, can't wait to get back into climbing when i go to uni :,)
this one was interesting because obviously you would have experience, but would probably have forgotten stuff
💪
I love his beard falling off halfway through.
He has wore socks and sandles. And have patience and temperament of old man.  This disguise is mission impossible in standards.
"if you are not falling, you are not trying" such a nice and high motivated climbing coach.
He ain't fooling anyone with his voice
Loved it. Great work with the makeup, acting and even the accent! Greetings from Germany and thanks for getting me into rock climbing some years ago!
Don't know if it's only me, but Magnus looks a lot like Messi !!
Nice video and super funny! 😃
Josh!
The Accent is great!
still looks like Magnus 😂
73 omg he went full old guy
hahahaha this is cero credible but is fun and i really apreciate the effort.
This is so fun to watch
Don't mention the war....
Imagine the coach suddenly speaking fluent german. That would have been truely amazing
Honestly did not expect another undercover video any time soon, thanks Magnus!
awesome video like always!!! I think that you should go out of America where no one can recognize you!
the screaming got me so bad
3 hours of makup to get recognised in the first minute 😂
11c straight into a 13 yeah think he caught on pretty eary
your German sounds good, did you learn it somewhere?
Magnus Climbing Universe is the only MCU I care about now
Parts of your playing were actually really good German xD. Maybe not the accent, it sounded a lot like French sometimes, but pretty good overall! Love those vids!
Weighted fatsuit for the next one.
Magnus was really in the role, that "genau" at 6:03 was just perfect :D
Magnus in sheff how did I miss this lol
scheiße verdammt xdx I didnt know you could speak German..love it XD
Almost blew your cover at 7:20
This guy was awesome
I have never clicked so fast in my life
That is the fakest looking disguise ever.. hilarious! :D
"But when you're old you've got less to live for"  😑  Perfect 😂
Magnus is scarily good at portraying old man mannerisms! Well done man ^^
I'm surprised they let him climb with the scarf!
Been loving your videos man ! Really makes me want to get out and try a climbing gym.
Was not expecting to see Josh Rundle here! Man gets around apparently haha
Dein Deutsch ist wirklich gut :D <3
Climbing with a scarf? Not on my shift brother! 💪😂 I don’t like Frederic too! 😂😂😂 Amazing funny video! 💪😎
funny video, why do you know some german words? nice "Nähmaschine"
To me as a German it's really funny to hear you speak some German words. These seem so much out of place after having viewed hours of videos of you speaking only English.
Great video!
the leg twitching was so good😆9:24
Frederick, ich hab doch gesagt ohne Training wird das nichts...
Haha still dont believe it for a second haha try it in a different country or continent
The German accent, you nailed this pretty well 😂👌🏼
The shaking on the pink wall was excessive? Not really sure as I don't watch newb or older climbers...
Jeee, who could that old man with a camera be?
Are Björn and Frederick related? They look so alike!
Magnus out here showing us all these super chill and awesome instructors.
oh how original
tysm for this effort I love these kinds of vids
As a German I love his german exclamations and accent   genau… zu,zu,zu!… Scheisse 😂
Pretends???
You should do one of these with Theo blass and have him pretend to be a beginner climber🤣
Man, retirement took a toll on Magnus 😔
I cant believe Frederick finally came to life 😆
Magnus with another banger!
can't wait for your next video "blind man with no hands climbs 8A"
for the algorithm
„But Güllich was better, wasn‘t he“ I died laughing at this Point 😂
The leg shake at 9:24 🤣🤣
If an old man comes into my gym with a camera crew I'm expecting Olympic level  feats of strength.
Mangus is growing his collection of alter-ego climbers :-)
i started from magnes
I lost it as soon as he started his war screams💀💀
always love these videos! haha your awsome
the beard omg...
Um…😂
Magnus is very good at pretending to be very bad
the coach sounds like he's about to talk about engineering
Fairplay for trying this one, but I think 73 was bit of a stretch :D
love the german swearing😂
I love these ones pretending not to be a beginner!
these types of videos are always the funniest keep it up magnus
Magnus: but no one did it you know  Coach: Yeah they did it was around since the 40's
Love the video, cannot wait to see who you disguise yourself as next
yuu gotta worrk on yourr gerrman dialect forr surrre! funny video! love how the fake beard totally falls apart XD
Bring back climbing content
Been thinking for ages that Magnus could make some great videos if he went to the uk. Great to see it finally happening
Lol dude you need better make up
I'll give up my bowline when they pry it from my cold dead hands.
the beard coming off 😭😭😭😭
Inspiring work as always Magnus, keep it up!
Makeup is more or less decent but come on man, the voice and everything... the video is fake as fuck. No way you can sell this to anybody, we're approaching tik-tok level of cringe.
So I have been mostly inert for a while now, spending almost all of my time at my computer. Yesterday I finally went to my local rock climbing gym, mostly due to Magnus's content and I had some of the most fun I've ever had. I'm certainly going back and while I am extremely sore, I am looking forward to the future! Thank you so much Magnus your content means the world to me.
As a German, I can confirm "zu, ZU! Scheiße!" is the official term for "take!"
that subtle German accent hgahahahhaha
I love the german accent he does. It sounds pretty good to be honest.
I love this video, I was also in the foundry a few weeks ago.
Been loving these new style of videos your doing keep it up 🧡
It’s giving hot doggin Hans vibes, ifykyk😂
Good old Magnus the Trickster!
That was the best test of skills ive ever seen a coach do. Great stuff and great effort magnus! love to see ur channel growing! EDIT: Ur german sounds great!
wow so now what''s the next step ? I totally see you act in a movie
I love seeing magnus in character😂😂 Always funny
Magnus out with another great video, love it man!
The content is just so good
First?
Lol, the dude knew all the time what's up 😂
lmao you nailed the mannerisms - physically and verbally - of an older person reminiscing. pretty dang convincing grandpa, there, Magnus
The shaking hands are so accurate
You look like a completely different person...
imagine getting a heart from magnus really big fan sir LOTS OF LOVE FROM INDIA
"they're not climbers you know" I cracked up at that
I love these types of videos keep them up !
Can't wait for this man...
This guys is my climbing instructor and he told me he knew from the start ...
There's too much fucking shit on you. You did way too much. The Chin kills!
Magnus you are the GOAT at climbing and one of the funniest YouTubers
I always love the coach so positive

I'd like to thank Magnus for introducing me and many others to rockclimbing. After I started going to my local climbing gym my mental health has improved a lot and I feel fit and healthy for the first time after I was forced to stop playing football. Thank You, Magnus!❤
