i,) 👽
Alright for Nicki Minaj doing a duo with my #1 trans Sister!🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
🔥👌🏾
Who's here in November 2025?
Nicki getting involved in this level of a slay with a prominent feature and shared track credit w/ a trans artist in today's world says SO much about her character <3
And ofc the Better Off Alone interpolation goes w/out saying! Done the best so far by far omg
My 5 year old thinks nikki is the real barbie she calls it the barbie song 🥰
JUST got that Kim is in all these hyperpop polished versions of like, those hypersexual weirdly aesthetic pop EDM music vids from the early mid 2000s (Fedde Le Grand etc.) Those were always a bit gross even when they were hot because it was always male producers and it felt SO male gaze-y. Ugh. Reclaiming that vibe is SUCH a pull. Kim pulls it off so good. Omg crying SO good
Yesss girls. I LOVE how nicki always shows up to the studio w/ the other artist these days even if they're much more indie than her. Such a queen. BOTH queens. GAG
Perfect song for douching as a clean Barb.
playhard
I got tricked and at first I didn't knew Kim is a transexual.
❤❤❤
What did Kim do to her face? She doesn't look natural at all anymore. Also, her choreography and vibe feels very "Britney at the VMAs" like she is just phoning it in kinda thing. #FLOP
Here in 2025 💕
Yes straight to the topper plus to be able to get easier 😊
Yes straight to the topper plus to be able to get easier 😊
NICKI MINAJ 💋

The transformers😂.
Don't forget Nicki was the FIRST EVER RAPPER to collaborate with an openly Trans Artist.
I am so f**king proud of you Kim. Who's still here 2025? I've loved you since the day I discovered you. I have seen you live 3 times SO FAR. You stand for SO MUCH. You've done SO MUCH Queen. ❤ Thank you.
This song is better than cardi b whole album ❤

i can't even imagine how hard it was to get that latex on😂
the matching hairstyles and outfits are so iconic🔥🔥🔥
kim's voice is amazing, so powerful
😢this was an easy bb number 1
If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy. If our love's is insanity why are you my clarity
Is Nikki was in the song it would suck
Just Found Out That They Are Under The Same Record Label❤😊
EUROPA 2
When Nicki used to be cool
I remember her song with Sam Smith, but then I didn't really follow her after that. A snippet of this song was featured in another video, so I had to hear the full track and...  OH MY GOSH IS THIS SO GREAT!!! I like that she used a sample of "Better Off Alone" by Alice Deejay, yet her beat is slower and funkier.  I really need to check out more of Kim's stuff. She is even better than I initially knew!
I love this hit l played it on a daily basis ❤❤
not another Ava Max
Clarinet is penis?
Here coz my queen 👸 nicki minaj ❤
Why is this an experience 🤯
Icónica ❤️
The fact this song still hasn’t hit a million likes!

KIM BEING A FAN IN THIS VID IS SO IT NGL LOL LOVE THEMMMM
Американские клипмейкеры и музыканты безусловно лучшие в мире, но такие видео это полное разочарование в творчестве!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Shocked this wasn't a hit!!
This is an excellent fantastic song!
Umm 😮nooo
❤❤❤❤
It made me so sad the hype of this song then it was just shit
What's it gonna take? hmmm, well you'd need a new manager, label, movie distribution network, a team of attorneys to change the American constitution and some good oral skills and you really would have to loose the black woman. I am better off ALONE, not thinking about it!
Cant hide this jawline!
Why does this beat sound so awesome 😎
i love this song so much but the music video just looks like she’s harassing the guy driving. 😅 it’s giving “losing all my sanity in the back seat” with the way she’s rolling around back there ALONE while dude’s just trying to driver his uber client home while she’s drunk asf 😂😂
02:05 when you feel jealous of your boyfriend with anyone😂😅😂❤

Better Off Alone is one of the most sampled songs at the same rate as Blue by Eifel 65 and Barbie Girl
Ich finde, Kim sollte wieder so ähnliche Musik machen. Was sie aber jetzt auf YouTube hochlädt, kann ich mit meinen Eltern im Auto echt nicht hören.
2025 ❤ History was made!

Im so excited for the next album GUUURL 😭😭✨✨✨✨

Where do I even begin?! Disgusting and perverted. Its all about sex, and I don't care what anyone on here says. That is a man. He can think he is a girl all he wants. No kid of mine would be listening to this trash! Terrible world we are living in. When right is wrong and wrong is right.

"if you want me let me know" youre a boy so no. In fact look like one fr in this video. Btw love how artists rip off old melodies and throw a beat behind them then pass it off as their own originals. No mention of Alice Deejay bc the label paid them off for it. Still its every dam day now, remaking movies into crap and the music too. Bye boy!

Art is most used when HATED, don't you pretend people wanna be a good person, people wanna watch people get AWAY with being on the AMERICAN team, which is pretty nasty when you think about it. They all gotta show off their "not" Hitler combat preparation, like write better personalities for these American EYES, ya weird. Kamala approved word choice by the way, totally legit political attack, catch.
Plz I do not want u judging by how u dress for millions to see u... you a hoe idc how much money u got no thanks, plus u have the jawline of a dude.. good song tho 👌

I'll never forgive y'all for letting this flop
Has Nicki actually ever appeared on set with the other artist in a video? It's always so obvious she shot separately. Even Madonna couldn't get her to show up in person.
I LOVE YOU

Nicki never fails us period! Also Kim petras did her thing on this one too. You can say I been under a rock for this but this is my first time hearing about kim. I’m so great full to see both of them together to make this amazing sound 👏 💞
this was worse than auschwitz
trump has won when u guys let this song flop
Is this play hard of david guetta and some parts of destination calabria video clip?
Very good song and love them ❤❤
This FAT Bebe Rexha is killing me 😂! She need to go to the doctor Now Zaradan . I remember the time when she make I got you ( in the video she was so skinny and beautiful) .
Love it
IDC Nicki is the QUEEN of RAP, Yall hearing how she is running this🔥
Awesome 🎉🎉
I feel like she's gonna be hella embarrassed by this video in the future tho.
I love them but WTF??
Nikki is a rare Breed of singer 😮😮 she can rap and actually has a great voice for normal singing as well which is quite rare . Not many out there can do  both styles of music . . Charlotte church for one anyway . Insane opera voice and had a few singles in the pop charts for a while . Then disappeared and turned up on the masked singer 😮😮😂😂😂 . Soon as she sang i instantly said her name . And my daughter who is mad for that show was like no way !!! 😂😂😂😂 . And Kim Petras is hotter than LAVA 😮😮😮   id let her give it to me all night !!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂 😮😮😮😮😮.
It started off so good then it gets to like 40.0 seconds in and then ruined
I love summer and this gets me to the 2015 summer vibes! makes me feel so cool and happy, thank u both queens, kisses from Perú 🇵🇪🦙💋
Young Money!
Love this song Nicki’s verse frrr ateee❤❤❤❤

I have the feeling that, say 20 years from now, Kim Petras' tell-all is going to be FIRE with a lot of names of those who tried to hit.
I've been tryna give it to you all night What's it gonna take to get you all alone? I just want you here by my side #Queens ❤🥺

Nicki Minaj  is  the absolute  Queen of Rap.... The way she can ride any beat is the reason  I love  her..... Forever a barb.... absolutely  love  Nicki Minaj
I wish I could magically physically transform into a duplicate of either Kim Petras or Nicki Minaj. I hope at least Kim or Nicki would want to see me physically shrink into an exact duplicate of one of them at least.
This song should’ve came out in 2012-2014, would’ve had an insane run.
This reminds me of 2012 Nicki Era❤️✨

Love it!
Gente os crente não podem ver esse clipe 😂😂😂😂😂
Gaga is Gagging and live for it 🩶 let’s embrace the monster inside once and for all 🩶
Awesome video and the background is so amazing KIm is so gorgeous and beautiful and lovely and amazing and she have a lovely voice like an angel this song is perfect for nights clubs and people cars 💯💯👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🔊🔊🔊🎶🎶🌷🌷🌷🇨🇦
Everyone's talking about Kim Petras lately so I wanted to give it a try... and the very first thing I hear is a sample of an old song. Like record companies always tend to use when running out of ideas for a pop girl.😅 It's so sad. Most "new" pop singers sound and even look the same. Sleek long hair, barbie slut aesthetics and a very thin voice. Maybe this german girl is talented, but from this Better Off Alone remix I can't hear it. Terrible. And even more terrible for german reputation. At least we have Rammstein to do well in the states. 😂
Kim Petra's is beautiful
It’s the same concept as the black mirror Miley Cyrus vid lol
Okay that sounds good
🥺بارين 😔مانل 🧑‍🦼🧑‍🦽🧑‍🦯🚶🏃⛹️🐣
Is it just me, or is the beat in the background the same as in David Guetta - Play Hard?
Did that clarinet consent…. Even I’m traumatized
mother monster cooked the antidote, feed the children, left no crumbs, left no room for later... on God ....give mama a Newport ciggie STAT
I see Nicki gifting the “Super Bass” fantasy to Kim and i’m obsessed with it 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑🩷🩷🔥💅
The Song Reminds me off the Song ,,better of alone``
It remind me by alice deejay alone
that was so cute

The girl in the beginning to the left of Kim is super sexy she killed this music video; she is wearing the orange bikini. She is 100% the highlight of this song / video. Like the part when they are on the balls and she says I can ride it all night? KIM is so lazy on the ball the girl in the orange bikini killed it. Kim is horrible.

the queen of rap and the princess of slay
Who is here in August 2024😅?
typical trash videoclip of unatural, unsensfull, overacted, expensive mess. Becouse " Thats how the showbusiness works" ... :D ... You cant just wake up, wear jeans and shirt and go to studio to sing a song. ... That would be so natural. What a celebrity you would be then. You must be extravagant.
1:45
If you’re here August 2024 you’re an icon, a LEGEND ✨
one is never enough, you should listening more and more and more ♥♥♥✨
Kim is so incredibly sexy and yes I know that Kim is transgender and I love it so much more.

I read a post of hers saying she loved Gaga's Chromatica so I looked for her music hoping sound similar to Gaga. I didn't know she was from Little Mix. I watched that X Factor season. This song is 🔥. I'm looking forward to hearing her first solo album.
I follow the fluid in the music  I can swap body fluid with is and have different abilities like dress up and stuff  I am immune to many sexual diseases so dont worry

Healthy girl's is cute too cute. Nice comment is,good.👍.
That's a biological male
sorry but i’m gonna say it 🥰 the reason this didn’t do as well as it would have if other pop girls released it is because kim is trans and they don’t wanna show recognition to trans artists 😗 because let’s be real it’s a song with THE nicki minaji on it 🥴 if this was dropped by another massive pop girl people would’ve been all over it. they always are when nicki features on a song.
So cute bb love this
It should be marked with *Productplacement* label
❤❤❤❤

There have been about six major songs that remixed/sampled "Better Off Alone", and it's no coincidence that the best one features Nicki Minaj.
i think im crazy but i swear this tune sounds so familiar like early 2010s i just cant figure out where😭
This is an akon song inspired right? Or am I tripping?

Good song but this Kim Petras chick is 🤮
(Hacking)
work hard play hard~~
This really is a good song. But I genuinely can’t hear this without thinking it just doesn’t bring out the same excitement as the 2.0 or 3.0 versions. You can really tell the contrast between the verses and the chorus, it really should’ve went more towards the euro pop direction.  Still a total bop tho. 🙌
happy anniversary alone
The hit that got away :/

This song is trash. Shit plays everyday on the radio, it's sucks, can't wait to never hear it again with all the other useless garbage that never gets revisited.
Imma just gonna ignore the fact that it's a sex song and just focus on the nostalgic sounding beat 😅
Copycats 😂 can't make up your own beats stealing others beats an mocking the classics "Better off Alone" Alice DeeJay listen an like always they never got credit for the beat at all I'd sue.
Kim is a real juicy beauty ! Petras!

Kim Peters masz piękny głos
Them  singing together so good
Immer allein, auch in der Nacht!
Ariana Grande called.  She wants her hairstyle back.
Let me tell you how mf jealous I am that I’m just finding out about Kim Petra’s and how light her voice is I wanna see Ben Shapiro say shes not allowed in the women’s restroom
I don't believe I've seen worse product placement in a music video😂😂😂😂😂😂
i really love when Nicki is playful on her rhymes❤
songs so fire , gonna get nostalgic in a couple of years
Bin ich einzige die den Song in 2024 hört 😂

I love this music❤😮
This a throwback to the 90s!  Not the 2000s… #AliceDeejay
Nicki❤
I had to put a piece of garlic up my nose when I went down on one of these "girls". Sorry
When you tell your awkward friend to act sexy 😂
Who let the Sex Robot have a music career 😂
Men singing with women beatification
this is so fucking ass oh my goodness
The original can't be topped. It won't be topped.
Trans girl magic!! Go Kim!!
Kicki nicki

Denle créditos pues a Alice deejay
2:15 Nicki Manj when distracted
whoever directed this video needs to be sued for plagerism.  1st part of the video is a direct copy of Crystal Waters - "Destination Calabria" 2nd part is Mason vs Princess Superstar "Perfect "  Like really... not even going to try to be original?
He’s still a man 😂😂😂
To all Nicki's collabos, we'll never fail to enjoy every day.
Simplesmente dmais!!!! TOP!!! tmjjjjjjj🥰😍😘
ICON ❤
Holy hell this is embarrassing
NAT BAD , nat bad... but i stil prefer Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone (Official Video) MOARRRRRR >>>>>> I'm sorry Gen X
Kim is gorgeous, nicki is flawless. Unreal.
Change the background theme song. Do not disrespect that master peice with this crappy song.
Pov- You realise Kim is a boy 🙈
Make sure he knows your a man before you sit on him 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Them hormones helped Kim 😂😂
Kim is a man 😂
I love Kim’s voice so much and this is probably my favorite song by her ✨😍❤️
Podre
Kim if I told you that you can have a real one then would you go there? the disclaimer is it's the most pain and panic you'll be in until it sets... do you want to have that discussion?

My Love Song
I just want to let yall know that i am kim petras & i am not transgender. I am just ugly & stalky from being beat to death my whole life. I never signed to any label. This whole show is a lump of 💩 this account is phishing
Is this a Bose commercial?
Niki should her doctor’s info to Kim cuz she needs some butt..
💅🙏
It's a man, baby!
Suddenly I want to buy BOSE earbuds. . .  Actually no, because they've been mid for the price for awhile.  Any event, someone owes Alice Deejay royalty checks for a better song, Bollywood inspired video aside.  Kim does all the heavy lifting, Nicki phones it in with her standard staccato pattern in an unnecessary break.  Not bad, but. . .  Meh.
Nicki Minaj is QUEEN 😍🤩
Nadie valoró este temazo😭
Cringe as f
More garbage for the kids
Still love it
I'm so much addicted to this song❤
awful
She give it to me all night ? What she means with that ?
God damn this is terrible.
KIM PETRAS REMINDS ME OF JESSI SMILES GURLLLLLL
El Intro lo es todo 😰🥺
Way too sexual 🤢
kim petras voice is very beautiful but the video is very bad because it looks pornographic, it would be great if she walks alone or drives a car without wearing sexy clothes & unnecessary dancers
I love how the QUEEN 👑 is so versatile ❤
The collab we never kneww we needed❤😍
Omg the Blink182 ref 😅❤ loved that album !!🙈
'My mommy told me sex sells.'
yesssss!
Good
NEXT LEVEL SHT.
Fucking disgusting
Thats a man.... Wtf is going on , no you cant ride it all night 😂
noone can deny kim is really talented
Para mi el Mejor éxito de 2023 🥇😎
Little sister if you believe in me    ill never let you down.   Loyalty is my religion.     Just  please go to church Sunday morning.   Everything is possible that s the power.      Baby bandit.

Dj Jurgen is like :  Give me the money!
💙💚🙋‍♂️❤
Incrível ❤️
All he does is copy J Pop dancers and others.
This Beat took me back to Wiz khalifa *say yeah 😂
❤❤❤❤
I'm done I know Nicki Minaj didn't  just give a shoutout to her abusive ass husband in that "Kim Petty" line! For those who don't know her husband's name is Kenneth Petty and he is a known woman beater/raper. In the line she says " We throw jabs, bitch a get dragged, call her KIM PETTY.'". She thinks she slick, that's disgusting.
Industrial copy mainstream shit.
I’ve been trying to give it to you all night! What’s it take it to get you all alooonee
Yes 🎉❤
❤ love baby ❤😊
Salut petra
howd this song not pop tf off on the charts??!!
This reminds me of the early 2010s
Kim is so fine like damn
Whoever made that intro needs to be hired and fired again.
Here coz alone ptIII 😅
Xuxa vem aqui rapidao
My toxic trait is thinking i can choreograph this in those heels
Im here for Nickis Verse 😭😭😭😓😓
Salut Kim petra
Hey Kim, greetings from germany ❤
💖✨💖
Mi canción
Loveeeee
Amooooo
This song sampled Alice Deejay's 90s club classic hit, "Better Off Alone".
❤  🇹🇹
Love you Kim!!
So I’m just being annoying, I actually only saw this b/c I was on for Alice Deejay 😅 curiosity killed the cat in this case
The best referent
Trans woman power
Kim's voice is so good
Am I the only one who find the videos too sexual explicit??
kim cant hide he is trans... he has that man stifness in the lower back and that man jaw,,,,
Nicki!!! ❤🎉
No vale tenia que ser a 60fps
I love this for Kim! Having a song with NIKKI! Yea aiight
This song feels very nostalgic
So good
NICKI LITERALLY ALWAYS DOMINATES ANY GENRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
am i the only 1 think the song sounds like Play Hard by David Guetta?
When I first heard this and found out she was trans,  I was FLOORED. It brought back the worst day of my life , when i stopped seeing my therapist and went against recommended HORMONE THERAPY ( I was already 35 and terrified) now women like @KimPetras and @Therosemontoya  are TWO of the strongest trans women I look up to now, and have found a job that SUPPORTS TRANS INCLUSION AND THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERS TRANSITION FROM DAY1! WHAT WHAT GO TOYOTA!🖤🖤
who thought that she(he) is a transgender
They were sure to zoom in on the BOSE earbuds 😂. Product placement in ur face
I can't believe I missed kim in concert I guess I will have to wait till the next tour
🫶
its Play Hard song
I'm so addicted to this song ❤
🎉
Work hard, play hard.😀
Only true Kim Petras and Nicki Minaj fans can like this comment.

Lo mucho que escuché esta canción en este año  2023 🎉 ufffff ❤❤❤❤
Barbie y kim petras
Alone deserve her flowers
The beat is similar to David Guetta's "Play Hard"
Still disappointed with Kim's team cause this could have been a huge smash hit
at least i know how to play a clarinet now ...
this song deserved better :(
I'm still here ❤️💯
Would you let Kim ride it and watch her all night long?
Yes. This track is awesome🎉
why is music so  much more sexual nowadays my God we got hoes in most female music now yet the new generation says they don't want sexual attention but I mean the things you do like Dressing like this video show something else so yall can't be mad I'd you dress like this and a man stares at you because outfits like this are what turn men on and your obviously not wearing it for yourself unless your just a look at me priss but yeah I thought it was gonna be a good beat song qith ok lyrics but I was wrong dude. Oh and the beginning od this song should be copyrighted because it's a copy of another song beginning
Pretty dope
Who here's gay?
Why am I just realizing that their clarinets have no reeds lol

Don't sell your soul out for this world...God's grace covers all when we repent. Choose righteousness...Yeshua (Jesus Christ) is the way the truth and the life. God loves u!
I love kim and my Queen Nicki Minaj ❤️❤️
I'm a bad bitch when I perform this song in the shower  😂
💀☠️
I feel like Nicki don't like Kim because she the never shows up to concerts and stuff like that and can't defend her because she showed up for the Grammys bang bang song
Bop
Kim Petras and Nicki Minaj are hyper goddesses! 💞💎💕
1:57
(I just want to give some respect to the back-up dancer at @1:52; no disrespect to Ms. Minaj or Ms. Petras, I just love her look. 😍 )
Zlay
I love it ❤
So beautiful 🤍
Not only did need to sample a classice but have to act like complete perverts. Had potential so lame.
This is a cool video!  Beats and lyrics got great together.  And Kim: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
schon traurig das frauen nichts als perverse lieder machen heutzutage
This song hit me like a ton of bricks write back to save me
Is that Tinashe amongst the back up dancers?
This slaps🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Vocals are good but I’m mad they used this sample.
Pasame la hookah que andamos en jangueo como ruta que viva el teteo el desacato
Who's the guy? He's really hot
another flop
worst song to ever exist how song about riding a D can be even in music channels
Where is the sound from its sounds familiar
No one deseverves to be alone. I’m drunk right now but if your feeling alone right Now, talk to me. I believe in in one thing and that is doing the right thing no matter what?

My feelings are increasing. It's a very nice song.
I don’t know why it took me so long to notice how suggestively she was stroking the clarinet at the beginning of the video.
You're aware that you...licked a clarinet, correct?
That's a whole man. And making prostitute music. This needs to stop.
What talent
Better off alone-alice deejay
♡
Sorry 'Kim', you still look like a bloke to me. It's that pesky jaw line , dude.
The Sample is Cool ❤ and more lyrics but it’s just way too Sexualized, The original version better
Reading the recent comments make me realize how stupid the human race actually is 😂 This song is 🔥 and it’s a sample IDIOTS. Nothing will replace better off alone 😑. But Kim and Nicki killed this 🤩
Oxi a Kim petras tá fazendo cosplay de xuxa
Original better off alone is really bether than nothing can take original always is best don't ruin 90s edm
Song? Bad Music Video? Awful Talent? Zero Kim Petra's hits 1, and it wasnt even her song Nicki? Fallen off the charts -82 after one week.
Queens
KIM PETTY OMG WE NEED THIS ON THE CHARTS
Whats the name of the original song? Please guys tell me
No wonder nobody came to ur 13$ concert
I didn’t realize that this wasn’t Meghan Trainor until the end of the song. The opening with the clarinet was very trashy, but my girl, Nikki is looking amazing and she killed it GOAT🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 she’s a savage, and she stays in beast mode! The Barbz r back baby!!! #barbz #nickiminaj
Im sorry babes this was the best Nicki verse all 2022 hands down
TIMMY
Tim Petras
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Doesn't the background music belong to Akon's song Beautiful?🙄
I love this song!!!
Love the red on nicki love them together loved kim since the beginning when she was transitioning and had a video of duct tape!!
son unas grandes reynas
https://youtu.be/KSd4nGoNftg?si=_1tPfzq2t-a4O_RI
I wonder how many of you know that Kim isn't actually a woman lol
Commenting this on 8 November 2023 and I can’t believe I didn’t listen to this song earlier!!! This song is bussin!!
The best
The fact I never knew Kim Petra’s use to be a man is crazy 😩✌🏾
Hard pass unfortunately. Took a beat from a good ass song and trashed it all the way with these cringy lyrics. Looking like straight trash
Play this shit at my gym all the time shit grew on me and now here I am 😂
This song deserved Everything!A HIT❤ nicki's verse goes hard....and Kim you did your thing
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Alone .... :(

who was fooled?
Complete retrdation.
Fuckin Bose commercial, extended mix
We need LESS songs about having sex... the shit is fkn over-done.
do you know that Kim is trans?
Nicki i love you
I love those masculine hands that my bro Petras has. Keep it real my brother
Get em Bro
Kim Petras thats my Man frfr
Bonnie & Clyde 💪🏾
I remember when this came out 5 months ago
In my opinion it’s bad
Sounds like
It's so sad that woman prostitute for man. The Man sit on a chair and the woman dance for him, what is that for a wrong Pic, you woman show them that man could use woman only for sex and woman are objects, dance only for the man. Please that's not nice and a wrong picture for man's and woman's that patriarchism, machism and against woman and man
How to get into heaven if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead you will be saved . Love Jesus
AS MELHORES!! ARRASARAM MUITO ;)
This song flopped hard 😢 had the ability to be amazing until the beat change on the verses.
How could she sound like a biological woman? She's trans, right? *Gen Question, no offense
Love this
My favourite song ❤️  Stupidly underrated
well played its new back
What was the original song for the soundtrack they used?
Flop
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Kim Petra’s is cute….she reminds of….IF Megan Trainor & Kelly Osborn had a baby ❤️👌🏼
I like it ! But @Alice Dj-Better of Alone@ was better. -)))

This came out on my 21 st birthday 💗💗💗💗💗
Kim Petras bringing back 2000s eurodance was such an iconic move, I get so much nostalgia from watching this video, and the fact that Nicki was on board makes me love her even more

Video giving off destination calabria/call on me vibes.
Was that ice spice in there with the black bob?
This is not music. I miss the 1950- 1990 era where music meant an emotion.   These days songs are garbages which people easily forget after sometime. Say the same thing 10 times, show tits and booties , be vulgar and song done. Idiots on internet like the videos and music academies rate it based on number of likes. Utter trash  Listen to Queen, Beatles , Nirvana, Pink Flyod, The Doors and so many more legendary bands or singers. Most of those legends might not be among us anymore but their songs live with us forever.   The music industry sucks balls in the current era
kim is a freak of nature!🤮
5 miesięcy, a ja dopiero teraz na to trafiam? Nutka sztos❤ from Poland
That was one sexy ass video there hahaha
Una buena electrónica
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Its a dude... 🤢
Its the amazing Alice deejay tune or else this song is nothing without it.. 25 yrs on and this tune never gets old.. brings back some great memories..
Good song, but so much of that comes from that killer synth line from Better Off Alone. That was an incredible song that has been getting people dancing for almost 25 years.
2:06 ? IS this tinashe ?
David gueta?
🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
Strange but I want to buy a set of Bose earbuds? What's that about?  Ugh - I get it but do you have to be such a slave to the brand and really... do you need the sponsorship that bad?! Just switch on auto tune, hire a writer (or AI will probably do) and just shovel out a few more like this.
I performed the 3.0 version both Kim and Nicki at Roscoes in Chicago, left SUCH A GREAT first impression. Perfect choice thank you for helping me be ME
I love you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I can't imagine someone cutting down his pp.💀💀💀
OMG PLAY HAAARD's new versioon 😮
هل يوجد. جزائري  هنا 😂😂
Alguém sabe a marca desse óculos que elas estão usando ?
Best genre. Trans trance
How did I not know the melody of Alice Deejay’s one hit wonder was playing throughout this song?!   🤯
It sounds like "Better Off Alone" By Alice Deejay 😮
Kim and Nicki slayed
🔥🔥
The fact that she is a transgender and Nicki worked with her says a whole lot
Heard this over the store radio... so i decided to listen to the Original afterwards. Edit: The new lyrics also change the meaning of the song.
better off alone is a timeless song
😍😍😍
i'd prefer that kim does not dance lol
Los aestetick a qui
Voll cool gemacht mega das lied
2023🎉
❤❤❤❤
Seriously hope you are paying Alice Deejay to use her music and vibe.
Stole this song from Alice Deejay. I prefer the original. 😑 the original song was not slutty like this.
I thought this video was sexy until they forced us to stare at the Bose ear bud.  Bose is just a bunch of bluetooth gimmicks now, and rely on product placement instead of sound quality.  Bose is not Bose anymore.
Yeah Kim's mother beat the hell out of herself in the hotel and said she would call the cops if I didn't do her and since I didn't trust most of the people there and was forced to go by Two fake friends and a worthless father and brother I had no choice. Also the driver got pulled over and a cop also forced me to go then at the airport they said I had to go. If I didn't go peacefully they would gag and bag me for the whole plane ride. And Dua wonders why I didn't want to come back you people on this plant are evil
I played the clarinet & I still think this looks stupid & the person who created the concept for the video needs to be fired. The director is the worst I've ever seen because any person looks terrible trying to make an instrument look sexy. Scrap this entire video. Y'all know I'm right.
kim hawt
❤
Love how Kim did the woo hahh  for the hard core fans ❤❤❤
Let's be honest, this song needs more recognition. It could even have reached 200m. Seriously, it's great. Kim, as always, innovates pop and well, Nicki, no way, queen of rap forever.Super well done girls! you are the best
Her wig i wishthey would give it free to people whoshairdknt grow like they wished it would #henm
Ay que reproducir  más veces 🥰😍🤭💅🏳️‍⚧️
Her dancing is quite awkward :D But this song is straight from 2010 and it would have been a crazy banger
Hi! My baby I miss so much I ❤u! John ling! 🤗😋😍🥰😜😘😔🤫🥱🥱♥️💓💘💖💝💞
nicki couldnt save this song either
💚💚💚
pelo que me lembro mais ou menos, esse clipe foi mostrado pra mim em anúncio abaixo de um vídeo  transmitido há 1 dia ou 1 semana por aí !  gostei muito dessa música por causa da melodia do better off alone ! e por incrível que pareça, no começo a voz da kim não chamou minha atenção ! depois de ouvir várias vezes comecei a gostar da voz da kim ! 😅
My favorite still Sept 29 🔥 ❤
Super clip Kim Petras et Nicky Minaj 💖💗💙💕💙💗💖💗
Yaaaaaaasss my cats and I just be jamming everyday to this song
Lovely song, lovely voice! 💜 I remember when blink-182 had the Red Cross on their album cover they got in trouble with the red cross because that's a protected symbol in the Geneva convention, I hope she doesn't get in trouble for the same reason. Among Us got in trouble for the same reason too
Just love that shit so much!!!Solid on repeat in my Car🎶🎉💥👍🙏🍀
I want you. Now you know pls I really want you,😍
too many ppl stole this song, its really sad
Why stealing better off alone beat tho?
Whoo!!!   I heard this song at work, and ever since, it became one of my all time favorites. Along with Nicki is the best part.    🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯❤️🤌🤌🤌. I’m now a fan of Kim Petras. The beginning reminds me so much of All Alone.
❤️
🥰🥰

Essa música é perfeita
Kim Petras’ voice low key is something special
When I sing, it’s considered shouting
it's been four months and i'm still gagging they ate this so hard left no crumbs no morsels
Do you ALL EVEN KNOW KIM PETRAS IS A ***** GUY?! 3:08 God please help this wrecked up World 😢
Omg hopefully kim/transvestit will never make it! I'm sorry for all THE REAL GIRLS which were forgotten because of "THIS"  *********** ...(monster)....
I'm a Tranny 🏳️‍🌈💋
Why does the quality go away everytime someone becomes super famous?
Se tem Nicki Minaj n tem como dar errado 😍😍👑👑
Is this a new song cuz,i like it alot its okay L.D 2023
Cara , simplesmente o melhro feat dos últimos tempos 💗💗💗
Nicki is so iconic
C'est fait C'est fait... meurt😢😢😢
Kim Petras acts pretty cheap, overly sexualized zero talent choreography, licking the instrument as if it was a dick, cheap. Yep, that's men making women look cheap
❤❤❤
David guetta play hard  back music….
The opening dance sequence is an entire vibe
I thought it was David guetta and neyo song ( work hard)
Nice.
I love this song a lot
what's the Instagram of the man who appears in the video with Kim Petras?
Finally a song that feels like 2012-2018 era
Nicky Minaj is the best ❤❤❤❤
Hello omg my Hola
Work hard play hard!
What a way to fuck up a classic.
Nicki is the queen 👑 of rap hands down! Early 2000 vibes with this song 🔥🔥🔥
I can’t forget about this hit!
Alguém 🇧🇷
Of course she's transgender!  I had never seen a girl dance so clumsily until her and I wondered what in the f--- was going on.
Anything Nicki touch is platinum ❤
❤ making America 🇺🇸 Great Music  🎵   🎵💋
this is such a good combo of that nostalgic early 2010’s sound and now. genius engineering done in that studio !!
Official Music Imitation. This is Alice Deejay + Call on Me video.

What a great song it was to hear it as soon as I started at second 2 and I love it, I think it's the best song I've heard this 2023, new sound but with essence of the 90s and 2000s, impressive 😎
This is just my opinion, but the new singer ruined the old music
Mds como eu amo essa musica 😭
Let’s be honest anything Nicki touches is just 😍❤️
Let’s see Andrew eubanks listen to this
I only listen to the first half
Watching Kim and Nicki swing their ponytails is so funny and cute 😂 1:53, 2:07 - 2:10 and 2:12 🥹
🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
😀🍄😀😂
Hey
Nicki so iconic 🩷😍💜
Omg this is one of my fav sampled songs I canttttt believe I missed this 😭😭 I love ittttt
Missing Guetta here 😢😅
At the 53 second mark it says that it could "ride it all night". With the state of modern vaginoplasty procedures being what they are, I doubt that is really true.
Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone (Official Video) ??????? just wanna say its the same
What a disappointment...
I could ride it, ride it, ride it, ride it aaaaall night 😫😋
What is she doing with that clarinet💀
😊
2:23 - 2:26 Mothers did not have to serve like that 😩😩
Oh she ate that at 1:20 - 1:27 😍😍
3:03 OMG THIS WAS CUTEEEEE OMGSKSKSJJJJSLSS
I want Do you know why Nicki Minaj is calling herself Barbie
The lady is hilarious talm bout “click on a bch before she finish her sentence” 😂☕️☕️🔥🔥🔥🔥 catch that dirt 😂
Reminds me of "better off alone" but a flip 🙃 version
They was killing this video 💜💜
Shit sample nicki saved this
Flop
Faltou uma bridge, um break sei lá  A música ficou muito linear, o único ponto alto é a nicki
😅😅😅
I hope that Kim Petras will become even more popular 😊😊😊
Definitivamente Kim Petras se volvió mi diosa desde que la descubrí❤  te amo Kim❤❤❤
❤Nicki inspired me to go all in  with my music . She was just like me , an artist trying to get heard .And now she's on top. It's happening for me , and I'm not stopping when it does !❤
Hino Perfeito Vício ❤😢❤ #2023

Hi yall?
Theses bitchs are so good together they make so good music
I can’t imagine that we will finally get the lead single from Pink Friday 2 next Friday 🥹 Barbz, are we going to push it to the #1 on Hot 100? Points are low now. This song is gonna be a hit anyway.
What’s your favourite Nicki’s song released in 2023 so far?  A: Shake The Place (Remix) B: Red Ruby Da Sleeze C: WTF D: Princess Diana (Remix) E: Alone F: Pound Town 2 G: Barbie World H: Money I: Endless Fashion  Mine is D)
Te amooo Nicki Minaj ❤Queennnn

What an amazing collaboration! Love you girls!
2:11 barulho foi esse.?
I'm sorry but this is gross, period.
no body talking abt how good this song is??
Such a disappointing move by Bose, to be associated with this clarinet-licking filth.
•3 meses após o lançamento dessa obra prima e eu estou aqui vendo essa obra prima😍❤✨
Song deserved so much more love😢❤
why is kim so awkward in this??
HELP ME THE WORELESS HEADPHONE SPONSOR CAUGHT ME SO OFF GUARD

Nikki gets more disgusting by working with this boy
Nicki part even the colors
This song makes me having a vision.
TEMAZO QUEENS.. BARBIE AND KIM PETRAS ❤
0:47-0:48 — Looks like Kim is clearly still the throat goat.
Wanna see the ladies dance.
I want you, I always have. I love you. Not that you’ll ever acknowledge me. I know you won’t, yet I’ll always factually be factual!!!
that's probably why girls are bitches in 2023
I can see why this never took off. Women being sluts only to  say they're not sluts and make a remix about it...
Naprawdę podoba mi się to ale mam wrażenie ze one to jacyś Replikanci podludzie czy coś.
Damn…this oversexualization looks really try hard. Sad.
7/10  it's great
Arrasa pra gente mana precisamos de você na mídia 😍🏳️‍⚧️

Best 2023 song anyone?
Failed society.

Kim Petras and Nicki Minaj did their best on this track . It deserves way more ❤
Sounds like Better Off Alone by Alice Deejay
I'm 41 so...Nicki is still a newbie to me
Nicky is PHUCKING Awesome she running her own race and is winning
This is my second viewing and I just learned there was music😮
Basically a softporn 😂
It's a shame to ruin an iconic beat with such degenerate lyrics.
Nicki Minaj is arguably the best female rapper ever; she has consistently maintained her excellence ❤.
More songs plase
This song is so good
Das Original ist Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone
the song still flopped with nicki in it. Her impact is not that big

Nikki must have struggled to put on that dress 😂😂 Can’t even zip the back up

Well done ladies, I love this cut.
❤Nicki inspired me to go all in  with my music . She was just like me , an artist trying to get heard .And now she's on top. It's happening for me , and I'm not stopping when it does !
It looks like a pxxnographic parody of Sucker Punch. Kim looks extremely uncomfortable with hyperse*ualization...
New song from Nicki Minaj is here and we put on the lyric so you can sing along Check this out!!! https://youtu.be/tmF__S3_JcA
Nicki is tiny she always looks tall in her pics
Why not learnt the clarinet,it is a worthwhile instrument to learn. Instead of dancing with it suggestively...
I see that Bose paid for advertising
Why isnt this on the barbie soundtrack
Just saw tinashe
Please this is the type of tracks we need 2010 vibes
this song is so underrated
Thought this was the barbie song. Why isn't it in the soundtrack?
I love this song sooo muchhhhh .🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹

It’s Kim tryna get in her Nicki Mode for me lol 👌🏾
This video is full of references from early 2000’s music videos.  0:14 Alex Gaudino - destination Calabria  0:41 Eric Prydz - call on me   0:53  Mason vs princess superstar - perfect  2:32 Fedde le grand - put your hands up for Detroit / or Alex C - Doktorspiele

Chocada com a tradução kkkkkkkk Mas, a batida é viciante 🔥
its not just video music, its commercial  😃of Bose company  plus Nicky Minaj, woman who has money from talking to music  but I like this song   ❤
Alone deserves her flowers!!!
Lets just remember that there's folks who don't know the song she sampled, let's give em time 😂
Why does everything gotta be remade 😭🥲
This song sounds like it's from 2008-2011 i swear
Parece que voltei para o ano de 2010 ❤
Impressionante ,como essa música é ruim.
Borrowed the beat from the song. But it came out well.David Guetta - play hard remix
What's up with the close up of the ear peace jw

Does she play the clarinet? If not she's using the lize flut as a gimmick
❤❤
Hino injustiçado, clipe e música impecáveis ❤

The song is lovely, but if that is how someone tried to get me home, I think I am better off alone.
Why everyone says that it gives them 2012 vibes?? I mean yeah because its stolen from david guettas play hard work hard song from 2012 lol
Gibt so wie so Bürger Krieg also strengt euch nicht so an Burzig mich fertig zu machen ihr seit dran Ausländer

I like the beat to this song thanks for making a good music video
typliky  german "huch" in the first second..
Don't forget about Alice deejay 😉
Song is 🔥 but the video is 🥱
All I can think is that's a freaking dude singing those lyrics. Just ewww
I cannot wait to meet her! im so unbelievably excited.
What a skanky video, makes my skin crawl 🤮
Slay it for us gurls Kim!!!!
The song is not bad but people need to stop sampling because the original is just as good on its own and the top of the best are people that can come up with their own tune to their song instead of relying on sampling unless they really like part or the whole tune then I understand where they're coming from.

I love you so much but on this video you look like a gay dude and not a girl just saying
Super lied ❤🎉🎊
Nicki carried as always
Gaymerica🤢🤮
Nicki literally left no space on the beat
When Nicki bring this flow out you know it's a super hit just saying 💯🚀💕✨
They killed it with this Collab. I love Kim sending them shots to the air scene....🔥💯❤️🔥...what's crazy is the many times she thought about ending her life because of the pure ignorance that come from the human being. But I'm glad she overcame it all and now look who's on top laughing...get em K.P.....🙏💪❤️
😍😍😍😍😍😵‍💫😵‍💫
IcoNIC

Nicki the Queen 👑
Nicky Minaj I love 💕

They shoulda added this to the Barbie soundtrack deluxe frfr
Y’all stole David Guetta beat
Megan Trainor has lost a ton of weight! She sounds great too. Love Nicki ❤
Nicki's best verse in a while ngl
♥️♥️♥️♥️
it’s giving old nicki!! love it
how do these artist steal old songs, like do they get the rights to sing over the original and give them a percentage of all sales?
This song sounds so epic.
KİM PETRAS 🏳️‍🌈❤️
I set trends from Queens to Beijing  I’m not the one that do the imitating  🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great voice no booty
I get the impression that she wants the D...not that there is anything wrong with that.  Anyway, I have a sudden urge to buy me some Bose headphones.
whats the nostalgic background song called?
Niceeeeee .....
Kim has given us banger after banger but that beat in the background was epic song & beat  back in the day
This really just shows Onika's ability to be versatile as a artist . . 💯 Only Nicki can pull this off ✨💕🌍
The arrangement of this piece is creative and innovative.
The bassline in this song is groovy and adds depth to the music.
Nikki went back into her 2010  era
One of Kim's best songs
Un coraje que traigo 😡😭puedo ser el hit mas grande de este año, que teniendo un temazo viejo  no lo aprovecharon como era y todos saben porque 😔 que mal
🫵🏾😎👍🏾
They ate this up 😩 been having this on repeat ever since it’s release 🥰

That's lit ❤❤❤
We don't care how many haters talk crap about Kim Petras, the most important thing is....  WE ARE BORN UNPERFECT
I listen to it only for the Nicki's part, really.
Kim needs to practice her lip synching. It looks like she's talking and not singing.
Love this video ❤
I love this song 💗😍
How many songs do we have now based on better off alone lol. For the longest time I liked the original one but now its between this one and the original. The vocals are amazing!
Omg i loved ❤❤

No pores!
It’s 2023 and Nicki has never stopped rocking!!!
Necesito saber el nombre original de la música electrónica que suena de fondo, no me acuerdo cómo se llamaba, solo lo escuchaba en la radio y nunca supe cómo se llama, me hizo recordar cuando estaba más niña, y ame esta canción es adictivo 💖
Ain't this An Akon Sample  The song called Beautiful
Gagging 😩💖💖💖💖💖💖

The Better Off Alone melody. 😍
Nicki NERVER miss!! NEVER EVER!!!!!

Too much sexual 😅
The same sound with “play hard” of David Guetta😢
What’s the original song and don’t say the wiz kalifa version I want to hear the original for nostalgia please if you know
Как точно называется оригинал этой музыки ?dj?
Is the beat a remix of better off alone it kinda goes hard
Orginal: better of alone from Alice Deejay
Alice Deejay!
Song on repeat👌🥂💕
It feels so good rapping Nicki's verse. I did it
Is that tinashe 2:06?
So cool! Shall we connect?
Alice deejay? Its so nostalgic
Alice Deejay still did it way better.
I’m singing it’s Barbie and it’s Kim Petra’s everyday since hearing this, so fun! ❤

Woow 🤩 so good the song bravo
Nicki just be featured on anything 😭
Giving batons hand jobs & boasting about bouncin on dudes. Ladies & gentlemen I present to you "entertainment" in 2023. Will never understand why everything nowadays has to be so overly sexualized. It's shit like this that's makin 12y.o lil girls think it's cute to be a h*e. Don't bother @ me I won't reply, I don't waste my time arguing about my opinions. Either way I fear for the future of my daughters in a world where their bodies matter more than the ppl they are...
❤❤❤
STREAAM
Outstanding music and quality Kim Petras I am listening first time your song but I am impressed this song so I subscribed your channel . I love love English song I am from India 🇮🇳❤️❤️👍❤️💕❤️😘😘❤️❤️👍❤️💕💕💕💕
Ain’t no way they stole the meme song
We need a Kim Petras, Charlie xcx and Nicki collaboration, I would literally die.
The Bose ad caught me off guard 😆🤣
♂➡♀ 😂
Excelente música nostalgia 🇧🇷
I salute you Nicki💯♥🤳💥🔥🚀🌟💫
Underrated song fr I love this song
Wow , High Start , Kim & Niki With Alice Deejay 🤩😍 Amazing , The Sexy Women , The Best Off Stars 😈 💔💥💯
Nicky❤
YEE
Alice Deejay did it better.
from which song this melody is familiar?
My god Kim can NOT dance. I think the problems from the SRS (of which there will be many) probably prevent them from dancing properly.
All rise for the national anthem!!!!
High Powered I love it!
Are the radio stations transphobic? Why am I not hearing this on the radio? ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Yeah they are. This been out for weeks and I ain't heard it👎
Love the original song, but enjoy this song too. I'm old and don't know who this was till I Googled. Good for her. Hope she has many years of success as a performer.
Magnífico el sampling del "Better alone" de Alice DJ
Nicky can be on any type song and make it hers
Sorry about love😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂

Wjeżdża biała mewa
I'll be watching this constantly until it hits 100M.
kim wirklich wieder was mega gutes rausgehauen schöne grüße aus deutschland :)
I been tryna give it to you All night
Found it! This artist (Kim Petras) ripping off one of the greatest house songs of all time, lol! I wonder if she has any original content, or is her record company just going to have her entire album be high-jacked for other artists with real talent? Type in - Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone (Official Video) if you want to here the original artist.
night at the roxbury?
WHATS IT GON TAKE TO GET U ALL ALONE
Esta canción no la supero, Nicki y Kim Gracias por darme este himno!!! yo si las apoyo esas 15M Son mías
How many times are they going to sample the same 5 songs?!?!
Geometry dash beat hahaa but very nice song
Nathan 💜 Like your music
Wow.. Great song. So profound. A master piece indeed 👏 🙌 female empowerment has never been so 👍
She looks awkward and forced
1:47
Perfect  pair!! Two queens 👑
Die Line ist doch geklaut? Der Rest ist Dutzendware und austauschbar. Die meiste Arbeit hatten die Make-Up "Artisten" und Kostümbildner.
That is NOT how you hold a clarinet.
i feel like I've listened to something like this before? Is it sampled from a song?
nice
😍😋
She didnt have to serve SO MUCH... and the Nicki verse salys and feets so well, go girl!
sad how these women present themselves as sex objects. If you are a girl and you read this please know you are so much more than something to fck.
Watching her from the very beginning of her career and now seeing her in a song like this with Nicki Minaj is crazy.
I love this song
KIM is Actually TIM FACT😑👍
Nicki minaj is the queen ❤️❤️
Shepherd's Chapel Network !!!!!!! Pastor Murray is an Anointed Servant of GOD who teaches the Word of GOD with Authority!!!!!!!
I love this song
Starting off with the fact that I love Kim and her music. Every since turn of the lights album, she has been on my "oh my gawd she has a new album!!!" list. Love this album love this song... But this music video was pretty bad in my opinion. I hated the "band" outfit.. Made her look like she had a double chin (not fat shaming just made it look awkward). Her and the dancers looked like they learned the choreography an hour before. I could also say somthing about nicki but I don't want the internet to hate me (which I love nicki more than Kim so). It's just my opinion but this music video was cring for me.
This definitely deserves over 100 million views
trans man think if he change his body he will become a woman 😂😂😂 nice song by the way trans.
😍😍😍😍
Nicki is like Michael Jackson to me ❤ I love both of them deeply❤
This is terrible.
❤❤❤
I fucking love this song AND the original better off alone. ICONIC
❤❤❤❤
Kim, Nicki, Alice Deejay… this song has it all! Love this ❤
is this giving anyone else AG & NM side to side MV vibes?
This is great lol
How dare people not view this I love this song😢❤
14 million views 🎉🎉
Still here
I really love the music but the soft core porn? These artists don't need it. They already have talent. I guess it's been so normalized now nobody thinks twice about it. Teens listen to this stuff.
Hardly seen and heard anything worse. You are destroying the original song.
90% top Gs only here for instrumental 😂
This video is comical!
The Best Trrrrrrrrr of the world.
It was uploaded a month ago but why do i feel like i heard this 10yrs ago 💀💀
nicki
The first part of the song is complete crap😂🙈
AWESOME
call her kim petty
Got*
Hot this on repeat like every day
Nicki always rips it up on every song.
Queen of rap
That's a man, baby
I guess Kim would have to ride it all night to keep his vagina dilated or it will close up and cause an infectious bubble then rot
Nicki Queen baby
Moment Kim kann Deutsch?
Linadas las dos ❤
Stupid video
Omg ❤🎉
Shit the video is soft porn lmao 😂
Queen onika
You ain’t Barbie you’re black
Yesss its The Queen and the Princess!!❤❤
Ruining nickis part with this acoustic pollution
Play Hard
Both of their voices reminds me of Sailor Moon or Toon Disney’s W.I.T.C.H. 🧡🌊🔥🪨🌬️
❤❤❤
Can we get a clean version without Nicki dear Kim?
Nicki hung up on that 304
Baby. This song so epic. It’s literally my life story
What’s crazy is I didn’t know Kim was trans until I looked closer. Her transformation came out amazing. Stop trying to hate on someone y’all wish y’all could be. Y’all wish y’all had HER confidence and fame. Stop being sad, listen to Jealousy Jealousy by Olivia because it explains y’all feelings perfectly.
I cant believe what musics become!!! This is dreadful
TEMAZO
People are to uncreative with product placement😭 at least try to make it feel natural
I love this song
I'm so friggin proud and happy for the success this transgender woman has accomplished 👏❤
Klasse Song und noch bessere Künstlerin. Verfolge sie schon seit Jahren. Hat hart gearbeitet für ihren Erfolg. Ich gönne es ihr von Herzen. ❤
Why I feel hearing music from David Guetta - Play Hard ft. Ne-Yo, Akon. It's look like same backsound is't right?
Come on 20 millones ❤❤

Damn. I knew it was a trend using a hit beat from the early 90’s-2000’s. But I had no idea it was going to be done by EVERY artist. It’s nice when it happens here and there. At this point they should place them on a “Now that’s what I call music” Album. #100 at this point.
was really hopin kim wouldnt go the route of the ho rap crap. Welp... another great artist ruined by the industry.
Kim Petras & Nicki Minaj - Alone it's nice
Bet so many folks didn’t know Kim is transgender and I’m loving that! She doesn’t need to prove anything, she has so much talent! She deserves all the success in the world!
David guetta❤️❤️❤️
Not me wearing bose headphones for my first listen of this song and then proceeded to see her show off her bose earbuds 😂. Let's go bose 💪 💪 💪 🔥 🔥 🔥

😮😮😮😮😮
😮
Lindas
The better off alone sample >>>>
I need band camp BAD
I guess everyone wants look like Gwen Stefani.
Wow, is the example to young girls these days?  We would never treat our clarinets like this or do that stuff in public.   But whatever.  I had to see what all the fuss is about.  Now I know.  Fascinating.
Kinda looks like an owl
Not me clicking just to hear Nicki but ended up loving the whole song
U can tell when someone is forcing sexy vs naturally having sex appeal
Who tf is kim petras
wow, the average talent of this is off the charts
Amoooo ❤
Linda sou sua fá

Nicki Flopaj
Obrigado por esse presente, no nosso mês, era oque a gente precisava🏳️‍🌈❤️🔥🔥🔥🇧🇷👏👏🥰
Anybody else felt like that scene where the girl did that acrobatic pose looked like a half næzi symbol?
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
And it’s like no matter how much of a expert you are. There’s always someone who’s gonna take you’re ticket. Best thing you can hope for is to stay on top a while. You know…. Be the BEST. 😑😑😑😑😳😳😳😳😐😐😐😐
Nicki Minaj is one of those people who wants to see the new girls shine. But she just doesn’t want them to outshine her.
they’re the moment ❤
Seriously, is this what popular talent is nowadays? Two women acting like strippers ripping off a dance track from 2000?
Such classy ladies
Nicki stay comin out her bag always been versatile❤thats why i love when she push her pen
queeen
i thought this was going to be part of the barbie soundtrack
EHH QUE TEMAZO. KEEP STREAMING! TE AMO NICKI<3
Damn she ruined an original.  BIG TIME RUINED.  Slobbing a clarinet   What is that
Is this a parody? When she licked the flute I thought this was jest.
im ready for tomorrow! havew been since 2021 Fall
Kim immer noch eine der besten deutschen Künstlerin. Einfach bombe die Frau.
Fogo
The original song reminded me of cattle mutilations and aliens when I was a kid 😂 🤣
I cringe so hard at Kim's facial expressions :D Like what is she doing? No appeal no charming energy. Yikes
David Guetta? 😂
Bellísimas 💙💕
🤍🤍
Teanna trump maybe
He's stiff in the middle
Uma porcaria essa música 😅😅😅
I love me some Nicky Minaj. This songs like some 2013 music by the way lol
Great with better off alone beat

Bett isn Brett, Terror
Merece mais reconhecimento nossa Kim S2
Kim lindaaaa
Крутой трек ,лайк
Nicki is the undisputed rap 👑. How relevant she's been in this game for too long without losing it to NO ONE is mind blowing. I head this music on a friend's story background music... immediately I came checking, no disappointment and it's been on repeat for over 24hrs and counting.
This sounds like early 2010's and late 2000's.
There's boxing 🥊 gloves with your name it https://youtu.be/LIpLNMA2BmI
Just think… That’s a guy lol
2:51 omg, Nicki looks like a drag queen xD
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I thought this was a older 2010s song omg 😩 the vibes of it
Mis canciones favoritas 🎉
Todos los creditos kim y nicki ...❤❤
Las dos devoran ❤
how you can make music and a video that has absolutely zero innovation or creativity. All that money to make a testament to zero. Every single element is a tired repeat of something thats been done a million times already.
dont put that Bose shit in your ears unless you want brain cancer and your 3de eye glued shut.
Summer 2023!!!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 main character syndrome
Aww Kim & Nick  is giving  us  the amazing  club vibes  unforgettable experience  in music 😀😀 Together  let's  gather  here for international Music 💕❣❣❤
whats  with the flute, fallic symbol, do these new girls know anything else except porn stripp  bdsm outfits; the song has no music value,
DJ Goofy White Kid brought ME here. This song is quite addictive.  ©2023
I'm so damn obsessed with this song it never gets old!
high level...  love it
This goes hard!! Classic! Let’s get it back on the Hot 100!!
Akon and david guetta 😮
Nadanya mirip play hard nya David Guetta
you have to be careful when inviting nicki minaj for a feature she just might end up taking over the song hehehe i mean look at what she did with monster she is deeply talented.
I want it.
I want it.
I wants it.
The fact that Kim was born a boy and slaying as a female is amazing .!! Hella vocals keep up the good work kim I love this !! ❤
❤❤❤❤
this goes to show "better off alone" goes with EVERYTHING

This vid gives me “FOCUS” by Ariana grande vibes .
Watch me Ride it ride it ride it ride it ride it all night...🎵❤
If Nicki isn't back full force I don't know what she is.  I'm almost convinced she's a robot at this point, she doesn't age or lose relevance!  This video and her in the "Will I Am - Check It Out" video look like they were shot in the same down and the Will I Am came out in 2010.
Look a mess
Tou chocado que a Kim é uma mulher trans! 😳 Deusa demais...😍💕
Love this song 😍❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So funny that beat is a trance song lol
Nicky and CRYSTYL methanie. Sweet dreams❤
Better off allloooonnneeee
Love it and Do this I never listen to this So i listened to unholy with Sam smith😅😅😅
This work is addictive, anytime I'm listening. Kim Petras and Nicki 💗😍
Summer vibes>>>
Very beautiful song
14M!!!
Just like nickis ex assistant said - she only works with the young cats to stay relevant! Otherwise she would have fell off long ago
J'aime cette chanson♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💜
🎉
❤❤ Nicki & Kim did a really great job on this song, they should do more
Sorry but Kim did that devil music with Sam and therefore I’m good
Ooooooo
Vykrádanie pesničiek je teraz asi v móde. Nepripomína vám to davida guettu - play hard.Obdobne ako Loreen s pesničkou tatoo tam je tiež časť melódia okopirovaná.
Worthless, just worthless. A waste of time and resources; just to create another sexualized music video of which in the end, doesn’t mean jack-💩.
its ATB track 🧘‍♂️🏄🏿‍♀️😎😍😊😇😀😀😀😂😂
🦄❤️🦄❤️
still a dude
I liked the video bc of Queen Nicki.
I get that this is the song Jocelyn doesn't like....that said, it's a catchy pop song. Exactly what it is supposed to be. Lily Rose has a really pretty voice.
❤😍😘🤩🥰🥰
The song is incredible.. the music video seems a little low budget?
eigentlich müsste es heißen Kim Petras feat. Nicki Minaj => Ich feier den track !
I love Nicki on anything ❤❤❤ take my money 🎉🎉
Songs dope feelin @kim_Petras and @Nicki_Minaj Barbie/ Queen working with Madd female rappers and singers ..she said she would let haters hate but nickis wat 40 not slowing down at all can't wait 4 her new album!
0:34 ❤❤❤❤❤
Yesssss Queens😍😍😍😍😍😍
Full Pop🎉😅😊
Repeat clipe several times 😮😻
Tô viciado, nesse clipe! ❤😍
Lol this song reminds me of david guetta 😄😄
🎉🎉🎉13 million views should be more
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Esa base es del tema "Better Off Alone"  Alice DeeJay
That base is from the song "Better Off Alone" Alice DeeJay
Can someone please tell me where I can find the Sunglasses towards the end.
Una colaboración increible ❤❤❤
If you thought after David Guetta, it couldn't get any worse.  Kim Petras: Hold my beer...
Kim looks so excited it's so funny cute 😭❤️
I'm so glad somebody finally brought this Wiz Khalifa beat back
There’s a reason the likes of Kim Petras wants Nicki on her track and the likes of Doja gives Nicki the utmost praise, Nicki is a sickening legend who deserves to stay as relevant as she cares to.
I hate kim petras. HE is so annoying
Wow, Kim and Nicki sure do know how to steal melodies! They're so good at it!
Another banger xo
Is real is moments ❤😊
Sorry Kim that this song didn’t blow up….. we tried 😢
Iconic nicky ❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
It's Barbie and Kim petras
Of course it's going to sound like a hit because it's sampled from a hit literally the entire beat is one giant sample of Alice DJ Better Off Alone
Love it❤ Nicki verse is so 🔥  Brand new range i just painted it betty(White)
Niki is ❤
Uma parceria com nicki minaj é ESSENCIAL para carreiras bem sucedidas
😍 amei
kalktı.
Nicki the queen 👸 ❤
This deserves way more views
Is that a real song or a parody sketch?  Like milk milk lemonade by Amy Schumer 😂
😢
sex
Best part of this1 is that Alice DJ/Better of Alone simple 😊 gr8 for the gym workout btw. Too bad it's so short
Hello friends. Although I am Iranian, I got a special connection with this music video, and thank you for the good feeling you convey. Kim, you are really beautiful.
?? Is that chanel #5 can someone tell me
her voice is so amazing omg
I love this song
I'm naive in this world😢
1:15 Conseguiram reunir Anitta e a Pabllo no clipe hahahaha
German Power Yeah...
song of the summer
The fact that you can tell how genuinely happy Kim Petra’s is because she has an iconic MC in her song. Even at her release party, her team celebrated her collaboration with Nicki Minaj.  Nicki will always support people, whether it’s financially, physically, or emotionally.
Kim is a transgender 🌏👹
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥wouuuuuuuuuuu hot
This music take me to 2010 🫡🫡
Y'all please keep streaming don't sleep on this banger
So good petty
You doing great
Doja cat ice spice sexy red heavy on it
Mamasita
WOW, Kim looks like a CLONE of Kelly Osbourne, here... Lit vid🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🫶🏽🖤
Welches 90s Lied ist das noch mal? Mir fällt der Name gerade nicht mehr ein.
Hi 😘
Kim Petra's is as good as 2012 Rebecca black, he should have kept his penis
TEMAZO
Inspired from Alice Deejay's Better off alone.
高瀬愛奈にしか見えん
Kim voice is amazing and she is gorgeous🌹❤
Is it just me or dose the song intro sounds like another song that I've heard like 100 times.the beat Feels so nostalgic 🥹🥹🥹
Loveee ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nicki truly is the queen of rap, damn!!! This collab was cool.
Kim petty 😅
You can't be serious with those pink exercise balls 😅
Swear the transition to Nikki gives off chills in songs idk why 🔥
Forever Better of Alone Alicee Deejay 🤘🎷🎸
Kim looks terrible acting in this video. I'm sorry just no. I've never seen Nicki have to tone herself down so much... Kim is SO WEAK here even with that hook. That can't be her best shot at this. The director has some explaining to do.
YASSSS
Beats hard but who’s this 😂😂
I wanna be mad that you guys ruined an old banger “better off alone” by Alice deejay but its actually a sick track. Better then bebe rexha’s “im good” version of “blue” by Eiffel 65. Kinda disappointing you turned a banger into something sexual tho. Great job and Nicki still comes back after so long and absolutely smashes it so keep it up
Amo como a Nicky me fez conhecer essas outras duas artistas maravilhosas que são a ice spice e a kim petras😍😍😍😍
Eu sou o comentário brasileiro que você procura
Love Nicki ❤
only original...
Amoooo❤❤❤❤ brazil te ama
Is it just me or Kim Petras looks awkward next to Nicki ? Anyhow. Love the sampling from Alice Deejay ❤
Copy of old song David Gueeta... Work Hard Play hard?
Nicki Minaj is the best❤❤ this song💥
Is that tinashe dancing 😭 if it isnt it looks sm like her omg
Nicki Minaj is phenomenal!!! Wow the ability to adjust to the sound of any artist !!! Is mind blowing !!! This song should be the song of summer 😩😩😩😩 🙏
A masterpiece
I like this song 😊😊😊
Troye Sivan, Jaden Smith and Saul Nanni.  (sex mute).  I can remember.  (persona)
This song is for me.
Isn't anyone going to talk about how they made references to some classics electronic music videos?  Destination Unknown, Call on Me, The world is mine, etc... ❤❤❤❤🥺
she's so pretty she's a doll...
Hell YES I love Kim Petras!!!! Her voice and talent stands alone ❤
Cinta satu malam, oh indahnya 🎶
“One night in town” wiz khalifa did it better
Terrible
Nicki😍😍😍😍
This my shit
so nicki decided to bring back 2015 ok
DROWN CHOKE
This Music video reminds me destination unknown and sexercise By Kylie Minogue!
this song makes a boner , Thanks again Kim
1:53 queen entered
Nikkis verses are short but she always delivers!
Colaboracion con danna paola ❤
Is that tinashe in the video?
2:10 wtf was Kim saying
Nicki went in
this is a good song but.... i thought it would copy right the original beat from alice dj-better off alone??
Over 13 milli views and I'm responsible for at least a couple hundred of them 😂🥰 kim petty I love you
An die Musik wird sich keiner erinnern in 2 Jahren. Künstlich, verzerrte Computerstimme wie bei Micky Maus und keine Mimik im Gesicht.
Amo❤
Kim’s face looks waaay too stiff, it literally looks like it hurts for her to make out words with her mouth. Too much tox. Yikes !!!
These so called artists can't come up with their own shit no more 😂
adoro
asmei
amo
lindas
amo essa
Am I only one hearing here David Guetta song
Ice and shots get ready they may sting! Nikki is the GOAT!!!
Immediately felt the nostalgia when i heard this song. Work hard play hard. The rap is hella good too. 2010 vibes
IM IN LOVE
Stop taking my 90s music god I hate this generation
What's with everyone, including *YOUTUBE* doing commenting about how good Minaj is or how cute it is that Petras lip syncs with her in *the single most erotic music video* I have seen in *years*?!
Bruh, my **ck is so confused. She has so much talent and is hot AF.
hit ultrapassado
I dont get it,  why do people think  this Song is amazing.... They Just took the melody from better of alone combined it with a cheesy pop/Sex/love reference text from chat gpt and everyone is Loving it... Wtf.... Congrats 4 nothing.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🦄🦄🦄
https://youtu.be/nEcLvi6ihd0 👍👍👍
Love from india 🇮🇳❤
I just want to live in a world where Nicki Minaj never goes extinct. She is a goddess.
It is great seeing Nicki being a boss more often again. Go ladies!
I love holding Chris Cochrane as a black man in my arms.
Nicki never miss🤝🏻
NFL Super Bowl half time show vibe❤
Listen to revers music it have Black satan massege
David Guetta Work Hard play hard tunes copy
It's gonna take me a whiiiile to wring the dopamine outta this one hehe 🤖
It’ll take Pepper spray, ropes and kidnapping.
Where did I hear this instrumental before 🤔
I thought Kims part was Nicki...😂😂A lil disappointed but this still 🔥 😂😂
Nah better off alone is better than this bootleg
Nicki came through with empathy, a stamp of approval, and a legit verse
Serious question from a hard left leaning lgbtq+/-$ supporter. How does he (kim) keep his dink hidden in these clothes?? I've tried tucking, Gorilla Tape and bungee cords and all failed miserably  😭  Someone related to biden told me it was surgically reassigned and moulded (molded?) into fun bags....but that would require a good deal of fore - and five! - skin!!
Evangeline an Chris Cochrane are finally together feels so good.
Boppppppp❤
This song is a bop ❤
Better listen to the original! Alice Deejay - Better of alone 🤟
노래 너무 좋아 나는 김의 보이스가 너무 좋아
flopou apaga a conta kim
Song of this summer 😝😘🤘
Barbie movie looks crazy
This Song Like a David Guetta - Play Hard
Bringing back those 2010-2013 vibes with this one
Wait. Was that Tinashe at 2:06?!
Nickiiiiii❤️❤️❤️❤️😩😩❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I really don’t understand Kim’s concept in this video… it’s dumb
Mais c’est tellement le kifff cette musique pour embaucher a 5h00 du mat 🎉❤
Chris Cochrane as Dennis Rodman is so hot!
Evangeline: Thanks for the like Chris Cochrane.
Chris Cochrane: 😃👍
watching kim try this hard to be sexy is awful, he looks even more ridiculous next to nicki lmao
Nicki is still here after the hate train. After what she have been through and the mess cardi made. Maybe she had to go through all this bs for us to learn from her that never ever give up and always believe in yourself.
Queens 😭
Made a big decision to change sex in her teens, and keep her passion of climbing up to this point and continuing to make more catchy songs is just so wonderful and AMAZING. And to be honest, I'm constantly addicted to this masterpiece!!!! 'm rooting for you Kim from Japan!!!!🇯🇵٩( •̀ω•́ )ﻭｶﾞﾝﾊﾞｯﾃ!!!!
I heard this on Radio 1, a while ago and not heard it, on there, since.  This is an outstanding song, recording and collaboration.  Surely some mistake.  The BBC should "A" list immediately and in the meantime, YouTube saves the day.
This is a bangerrrrr Jesus christtttt
very outstanding and upbeat song i love this new song and i love both singers love the moves and the customs in this song  and well done ladies thank you both for making this new song
OBSESSED
Kim and niki singing and dancing together was adorable af ❤
She was popping at the start!
This song deserves more appreciation
Estaría bien una colaboración con peso pluma para un intercambio de culturas 😂
“I send shots get ready they may sting”
I LOVE how much fun Kim is having during Nicki's verse. Her funny faces are so cute 💗
nickis input is very present in the video.
NICKI loking SICKKKKKKKKKK
Great song
This song is very sexy
Waw I love it
Ended cardi and latto
People cant just be nice but then again haters do make for good profit maybe even more then actual fan service so.....meh is what it is
Je veux un Feat 😢 seulement entre moi et vous même si je sais que je vais espéré dans le vide mais un Feat ferais grimper ma carrière
Le commentaire vient de la cote d'ivoire pays d'Afrique de l'ouest lourd hit ❤❤❤
So beutiful ❤❤❤
I miss this old style music 😢❤ This song reminds me David Guetta - Play hard...

Bose product placement! Puff puff pass 2 me please 🔥🔥
Keep on streaming the mv to 20M views ❤

Great song and beautiful voice Kim and Nicki ❤
Got that 2012 vibe, i like it
This song made me go back to listen to the old one when I first heard it in 1999.
My bf really likes this song.. i like it too, oh my gosh tho, the clarinets? Those look like an expensive model
BARBIE!!!!
Nghe nhạc Mỹ chất Vl

I like you Kim et Nicki 😚😚😚😍😍♥️♥️
Kim Petra looks like the sexy version of Megan Trainor
The iconic part "yeahh its barbie and its kim patras"
This song doesn't feel original..  is it sampling? Which song?
Nicki Minaj 🥰🥰🥰
🎉
nicki readyyy
when I first heard this song I thought it was released in 2015
She’s proof that the U.S. government shouldn’t restrict gender affirmation surgery for minors.
what is the original song of the beat? I forgot the title
Nicki Minaj the Pop legend still active in this era that's what Professionals done 💯💪
Why is this my first time watchin this, I feel late asf.
B*tch what you gonna ride 😳😳📸
lets stream this harder for the summer
❤
SLAYYYYY ITS BARBIE AND KIM PETRASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 💅💅💅💅💅💅💅
This a Bop!! 🎉
Oh wow i didn't know kim petras was trans like i just found out in the comments. Honestly thought she was born as a girl 😅
This is definitely a banger, but I think I honestly prefer the energy level of the remixes.
Glad to see nicki worked with you tim. Good to see a talented woman still accepting work with a mentally ill little boy
This is an exact replica of the song “ play hard” by David Guetta and Neyo
The destruction of humanity!!! Get this Devil off my screen
❤️❤️❤️❤️🎶🎶🔥🔥🔥🔥
U t et y
Girls bye y’all knew this was hitting
that BOSE product placement was really akward
Bose,why are you so afraid of not selling 🤣
Bop
Lol 0:32 pathetic advertising geez
#ANITTA
funny, but he cannot even have orgasms because of his surgeries, yet he sings how horny he is, would not be surprised if he is still a virgin
No comparison of nikki minaj
I thought this was a old song wtf?
MamaKatt, sumathat mine, the wet part, that part, shaking uncontrollably, nut nut, breaking your one soul to me,  you're mine,  dick way in ya til tomorra, feel tommara, deeper deeper like I'm trying to kill tommara.  Fyni Einuppa.  4
Alice Deejay is way better! And she doesn’t have a d*ck!
A MAIOR QUE TEMOS!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️😘🥰😍
Beat is the same as Guetta's Play Hard
This slaps❤❤❤
❤️
Alice DJ Alone : 70% of success 🙂👍
Alice Deejay deserves more recognition for their genius Better Off Alone rhythm! ❤
Like the song but the content is full of Soft porn which is not good.
Good nice🎉🎉🎉
should've been a hit
👑🦄💕
Kim Petra's used to be a man, correct?
I love this song, I hope to continue with this style of music 😍
Ame la fusión
Nicki killed that 😂😂
Songs okay, but this video is weird as fuck lmao, something bout Kim’s movement is strange haha
Elas entregaram tudoooo! E esse "woo-ah" da Kim é perfeito, uma pena não ter no vídeo ela fazendo, que nem ela publicou no Tik Tok
Jesus loves you
CORNY AZ SHIIIIIIII😢😂😂😂😂😂
I think I have heard this music somewhere before also.
OMG. Hits behind hits
Omg love this song
The tune is so catchy but why every song needs to be about sex only? Couldn’t you just come up with something else?
There is no life in this video after the opening scene.
Can you call it a ripoff of work hard play hard?🤔
Kimmy bad
Here for Nicki waiting 1:48 minutes that I'll never get back. ❤ Nicki.
Such a catchy song
She is copying Arianna Grande video side to side
YESS!!
This unbelievable. Children watch this garbage.
Lil x just ask if there are police cats, since there are police dogs 😂 3:50
Who remembered David Guetta ❤ this is his background music ❤️❤️❤️ it is stolen from it
Lil x just ask if there are police cats, since there are police dogs 🤥
That’s a whole dude & this song is 🗑️ come on 😂 Nicki better than that
category.... FACE... 10 10 10 across the board!
You said you have something for me  What will it cost  The last offer like this I took a lost  It started out fine  Then she showed who's boss  The cops had to be called  I got double crossed
song of the summer for sure
what did the clarinet do...
This mix is the best version: https://youtu.be/rNxgzHdSvAw
Holy cow what an awful song. Let's jam every current cliché and feature the most overexposed act.
Ban this song from youtube
Essa música é muito boa! A produção é impecável!! 👏🎉😃
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️ nicki why you hop on this 😅
I see some Super bass song style there from Nicki. That never disappoints 🔥
Wow!!!!! Nicki Minaj you are so amazing, music will never die in your mouth, life 💜🖤
Reinasss
This Song is Fire!
Isn't David gueta's beat
Its barbie and its kim petras
😍
everbody skips to nickis part hahaha nice
Ended cardi and latto
Hahaha 😂 hahaha yeah great music hahaha
Lovee Nicki , it is the queen 😍👑, Kim iconic beautiful!!
Love this song ❤️
😉😉😉
Beat sound like Play Hard by David Guetta
Crazy to see Destination Unknown referenced in the first scene
Younger people may not know it but the melody is from the Better Off Alone song (1999). It was later also used in Play Hard by David Guetta.
I’m only here for Nicki
❤
Melody from Better off alone
0:38
Much better than cardi and lattos duet
I love this song
yass
Get Money yau
Queen of rap Nicki Minaj ❤
I'm ready for Nicki to disappear.......  her voice is played out like tpain.
Love❤
Song sucks even with nicki on it
Love niki
Just the first part with the nostalgic beat is good
I relly don t care that she tarns
AMAZING❤
❤❤
What a bad song
play hard sound in back is incredible O_o best music !!
Onika ate this up! 💕
Red ruby da Sleeze in everybody songs
Best Song of this year ❤
Nicki is the best
I Can See Katy Perry On The Remix 😍😍😍
Its giving a 2000s pop song an im here for it barbie tingzzz😤😍💓😥
The beat is just "i ve heard it before but where"
Wonderful from the field of R&B, the duo has have it all
this song is so 2016
kimberly supremacy
The Better Off Alone beat never gets old.
Essa música é maravilhosa demais o público não aceita uma trans , Nicki Minaj te amo sempre
Giving nostalgia vibes🥰🥰🥰
Ate
nicki slays....but that meghan trainor impersonator sucks
Está muy cool la canción, un ft con bebe rexha, tove lo o Rita ora sería maravilloso.... Exitos
Allez y porté des vêtements. C'est du n'importe quoi. Êtes-vous possèdées par des esprits démoniaques les femmes Américaines!? Désolée pour le message. ✌🏾😇😎
What's it gonna take to get you all alone, 🎶🎶 love that line 😂
Is Anitta 1:14??
Vi una publicación de que la chica gastó todos sus ahorros en este video y no tenía mucho apoyo y vine a apoyar. Me parece una canción con buen ritmo
Bora 13 milhões
My father would climb out his grave and slam quaters out my ass if he saw me sitting in that chair looking at him/her.😅😅😅
Te amo bebe ❤❤❤❤❤❤
En verdad las nuevas generaciones se quedaron sin ideas esta es la tercera version que se basa o tiene la base de Better off Alone de Alice Deejay
the opening sounds similar to one song  can't find which one
Why do artists always sample and steal sounds from other songs! She literally used Better of Alone by Dutch singer Alice Deejay
Is this a bose commercial
I wouldn't be surprised if he  is still a virgin
just realised this sampled alice deejay - better off alone
The original song keeps getting sampled  It’s annoying
Garbage
Nicki ate this up 😍
Everything was perfect but couldve been more with a beat drop huhu
IT'S FISH HONEY!!!!!
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Nicki Minaj will forever pop up on your tv 20 30 40 years later trust me she ain’t going NOWHERE! ❤️
Here girls look up to this trash
❤🎉....😮
🥵❤️❤️❤️
nasty petras
Estou viciadaaaa
YESSSSSS KIM
Hit durmiente:(
Better off alone
Love it
I needed a song like that 😌
The first few seconds  sounds familiar, a song that came out around 2010-12?
great use of Alice Dee Jays better off Alone
MDS Kim must have been insanely mad about that hlpp
Ni siquiera salió Nicki Minaj 😢😢😢
These are superstars so talented Nicki Minaj and Kim Petras keep on shining Advancestarr 🤩❤💛💖loving you like that superstar🌟
Por que no le dan apoyo esta muy Buena la música..
Wow kim.... Super Frau mach weiter solche music, ein Ohrwurm... Lg Markus aus Deutschland ❤❤❤
It’s Barbie and it’s Kim Petras…   Edit: At the beginning I was not really convinced by this song but after I few listen I understand why this song was selected as the lead single for a reason is one  of the most commercial songs in the  album and with the sample of a already known song it makes more sense to me I love this song and the Nicki verses are pretty good the only thing that it tricks me is the part that she works with Dr.Luke and that’s something that I can’t agree with it…  #H1YTFTB
🔥🔥🔥🔥okruu
soy tu fan #1 kimme curas la vida
te amooooooooooooooooooooooo
Absolutely isane song😮
LEGEND 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Brazil presente 🔥🇧🇷
Nicki the best for real reppin from jamaica
This Song is song of Alice Deejay. Alice Deejay - Better Off  Alone
Alice Deejay - Better off alone
Such a great artist u're Kim!
Somebody give Nicki her flowers now!!! She bodies every feature ong 🔥🔥🔥
Ew the song is so sexual.
No sé quién es esta chica,pero sentí feo cuando leí que había gastado todos sus ahorritos en este video y no pegó. Así que aquí estoy viendo y dando like 🙏🏼
Big shit
The song is fire. But the whole thing makes a lot more sense, now that I've figured out who she is lol
Same tune as David Guetta's song? "Play Hard"?
I’m only here for Nicki
Do people realize that Kim Petras is really a man dressed as a woman?🤢🤮
🔥
Nickyyy's part was way to short ugh ..they couldn't give her space for a few more bars?🤔 Common. I feel like she was just getting started.. the rest of the song is waay to long. I feel cheated😅😎
cada verso de nicki es sagrado<3
This feels very 2012 Nicki, which is definitely something I missed a lot as a long time barb
Nicki I love
🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰🥰
The intro reminds of tinchy stryder
hi
I’m so mad this flopped alittle . I love this song
similar beat with AKON beautiful ..tempo also almost same.
❤
oh my god 😮
This is amazing song give me nostalgia and flashbacks 🥲🥲🥲
God dam you acting like a hoe! I feel like you’re channeling me and I don’t want you to copy my style lol,  love this video. Your eyeliner is hypnotizing.
I got this song from ovilex truck simulator ultimate and hit “mega hit”
This beat is forever in our hearts !
Amazing Song!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Amo 💜
Hit mundial 😊
Stopped listening when I found out kim is a tyranny.
Yay another song that's sampling a song that is way more known and popular than this will ever be. What happened to actually making new music?
Kim petras 😍
🐐
This song would have been better with a Ludacris guest rap.
kim used to be absolutely gorgeous. what happened to her face? doesn't even look like her anymore. she sold out real quick.
Um arraso de música ❤ Dps que surgiu Doja Cat e Card b a carreira da Nick Minaj foi pro buraco, Kim Petras dando uma força nesse feat ❤
Copied beat... First David Guetta now these...
The baddest song of summer
Yeaaah
I’m gonna make a dance to Nicki Minaj’s verse 🔥💯
i can see the references from the 2005 -2007 dance videos but those dancers were so SPOT ON...that this feels ....REDUCTIVE.  I wish she deliver a little more of energy and pop diva energy, cuz she is clearly a QUEEN
b-et
tumben nicki minaj agak ketutup
BOP and I can't scream it any louder
I actually love this song playing it all summer my new summer jam..Nicki is the mf queen she always comes with them bars periodd...always lookin amazing queen barbie forever 😍 nicki..!!!team barbie for life

Nikki is ALWAYS A team player 💪🏼 and She always supports upcoming rising young rappers that's what's up that's how she plays that's how she rolls Nicki Minaj will always be the queen 👑❤
great song
❤❤
❤❤❤
June 2023 anyone?
Esta canción hubiera tenido éxito si fuera estrenada en 2011-2013 xd
Dont forget Alice Deejay, we still loving her masterpiece.
ITS OFFICIALLY SUMMER AND WE GOT THE SUMMER ANTHEM!!! Playing this at every outdoor volleyball game i play this summer 🙃🥰
The melody is not original it is kind of boring music nowadays. Creativity is gone in our society. References about the sex why so degrading. Gangsters and swx addicts. We need inspirational music so sad.
When Nicki is there everything is beautiful ❤️❤️
O soy yo o se inspiró en el vídeo anaconda de Nicky minaj
Pure garbage. Zero originality 🤦🏻‍♀️
This wasn’t it…. I think Nicki knows it
Nicki and that dude are two good singers
YASSS NICKII KILLING ITTT!!!!!✨️😍
Kim selected the perfect female body of Nicki to showcase how much of a male body he has
❤❤❤
QUEENNNNN
Sir that's not how you play the clarinet-
catchy ❤
muito forçada, mas pra ralé serve
So original and new, is she reinventing the genre? The world hasn't seen such originality since never!
i don’t get how this song is not a hit yet
When you realize Kim Petras is a dude
PLEASE RELEASE WITH 2.0 ITS FIREEEE
Kaiguerõ
Este tema es muy 2014
I love this song 🎧 @nickiminaj @kimpetras
Alice Deejay. Probably made the best sample of alltime.
Nicki Minaj...una sola oportunidad puede cambiarlo todo y llevo 6 años esperando la mía para que mi música suene en el mundo, pronto va a ser, así y podré cantar contigo!!! Tengo flow, tengo el talento, tengo la disciplina y sobre todo tengo la fe en Dios❤️ Mientras tanto te felicidades por cada logro que has cumplido y seguiré preparando los mejores temas porque los tempos de Dios son perfectos💖✝️
Esta buena la canción ❤
Flooooppp
Pure produit commercial.
https://youtu.be/Lgs9QUtWc3M
And then people wanna hate because she stay poppin.
Definitely picked the right person for this, Nicki is definitely SHE!!! ❤
Ê de moi Site plai😢😢😢😢❤
Nicki Minaj je ta d'or tout ce que tu fais tout t'ai sont Me plaît tellement j'en vivre de vie comme toi 😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
We sang this in church last week
The only good part about this music video is Nikki. Straight garbage
More Nicki and Kim? I love the female strength in this video
Is it me or it’s taking me this long for me to know that she was born as a boy. Btw how much money did the operations cost to be as sexy as what u are 😂❤😊😊
🎉
Sounds like the David Guetta - Play Hard ft. Ne-Yo, Akon
❤
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😂😂😂😂😂😊😊😊😊
Bora subir as views
Queen Minaj ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
She doesn’t really seem so popular .. this is a bop I duno why she isn’t being recognised
Flop...
Kim Petras is scary and Minaj needs to just do porn!!!!!!!!!
NM5 IS COMING!! 🦄
This ain't right
Awww I love this ❤❤❤❤❤
She is a living Barbie doll 💅
This is why Nicki is my fav🤫
Where that oldest come from? I remember the original song just can’t think of it
I LOVE IT🩷
All the idiots in the comment section that think this beat is original. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
nicki why so good!
🎵❤️🎧❤️🎵
I love the video reference to Destination Calabria 😂
El cover del cover jajaja Solo Nicky salva la canción .
Why is it that Nicki is so fast to work with these white artists but have issues with the black ones
Why it's like i hve listen this back music before!!
THIS PART 2:12 - 2:15
“CLICK ON A BITCH BEFORE SHE FINISH HER SENTENCE “
Yeah... Shit
Hz effects = nostalgia
A total flop 😢
I love it here! ❣️❣️❣️
Its really smirk watching the performance
No es una buena canción y el video parece una copia de 7rings de Ariana grande
Still a dude
Goddddddd Nickiiiiiiii😍🥰😍🥰❤️❤️❤️
❤️
This song is giving me 2010,2011...vibes .♥️♥️
It should be new category Porno Music Video 🤣🤣🤣
Is that Tinashe as a backup dancer
The video looks soo out of place 🤧
Kim I love you 🇹🇿🇹🇿
Tim is that you
🎉🎉
👍
The sounds like black eyed peas
Eww
I don't know Micki Minaj I knew Kim Petras in 2008
Love the Nicki comments truly, but like let's talk about Kim? For just one second please. Kim's vocals on this are just so full one, two this is her bop, might not be the bop, but this fits Kim music style wise and we all know this and then lastly can we talk about how cute her fangirling over Nicki is. Okay, that's it.
LOVE LOVE LOVE❤
Another song featuring Nicki Minaj that has flopped
Nicki sliiiiiiiiiiid on the beat. Slick like warm butter. Well done Kim.
I THINK ITS SHADY HIW EVERYONE COMKNG K HERE ONLY FIVKNG NOCKI LIFE WHEN KIM SONGS BETTER THAN HALF THE WOMEN IN YHE INDUSTRY
❤😍🥰
Dont think about it would be a perfect disclaimer before you see the video, the song is much better
KEEP STREAMING, TEMAZO REINAS <3
Wait that’s a whole ass dude?! Omg
Nice and sex👍🫵
Exotic
Poor thing most comments are about Nicki lmao, and for the people saying this song hits with nostalgia, maybe because they used an already used before tone? sad
i like the reference to Destination Calabria
THIS NEEDS MORE VIEWSSSS!!!
Queen is slayed every single song, lol g live nicki minaj
Everyone talks about Nicki but no one talks about how Kim looks here both like iJustine and slim Meghan Trainor at the same time.
dr luke apologist
I love this song and the video is a serve but the weird clarinet shit at the start coulda got cut
☆
I'm definitely feeling the rush...Ms Petras❤

Im pretty sure that’s NOT how you hold a flute…
Best beat ever classic 🎉

musas
PLEASE BRING BACK POP
Esse aqui é hit 💁🏽‍♂️
Perfeitassss
Wanna be a balloon
Wonderful! Let's stay in touch.
Alice Deejay really did a timeless song, a real dance music anthem!
I played the clarinet in school and this makes me realize how unlike Kim I looked with it. 😂😂😂😂
Britney Spears & Beyonce version 🛐
Summer anthem for Me🙌
Anyone looking for a beat drop/europop remix, I just added a drop to this :)
This is so fnny she sample 90s dance track she gives me 90s pop idol vibes
all the instrumental of the song is a copy of the song “Play Hard- David Guetta “
I don’t know why, but I feel like Kim Petras is not really a trans, I think they talked her into agreeing to pretend to be like one. But I feel like this whole thing is a scam for some reason. I have no way to prove it and I’m not gonna do the homework to prove it because I’m too busy doing other things. But right now I’m going off my gut feeling. I could be wrong. I just feel like there’s some kind of trickery going on here.
PLAY HARD
Congratulations Kimmy we love you
Song of the summer
Someone needs to tell Nick Cannon he already has enough BMs 🤦🏻‍♂️
Que canción tan mala y genérica 😅
Love it here ❤
Lucky Guy 👍🙂
Omg cuando quiero dejar de pistear sale esta rola! ❤❤❤

Queen skated so hard on this! I love this song so much ❤️

“MAIN CHARACTER SYNDROME THEY EXTRAS”

Everything before 1:48 and after 2:16 is trash.  Nikki held this song down solely.
❤❤😎❤❤
Lmfao this song is about girls giving it up 😂😂😂
Sponsored by BOSE
When Jennie wore nurse clothes in their video clip the world started being like OHHHH YOU SEXUALIZING IT until they took it off their video, but when an american artist does it, no one says a word. Unfair.
Nicki's so iconic. 2:49
🔥🔥. Perfect
Stop sleeping on this song! It’s so good 🎉❤ Nicki skated
Is that Tinashe at 2:07 ?
❤❤❤ Wow! That was a great video! I love Kim!

Ily kim petras!
Actually I'm here because of Nicki Minaj
Flopped..
Why is she sampling everything now
These girls are talened and beautiful enough without all the sexualization incorporated in their videos , we really do not need to pander to the most base part of the masculine energy , we are QUEENS ,  remember that ❤
😎😁⚡️👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Period
Nicky still trying to keep up she still ok for a older woman
Many people think your gay if you think Kim is hot because she was born a man. I guess im bisexual now. Oh well.
I thought it said Kim kardashian at first 😭
WTF are these wordsss dude this shit is outta control. The whole song is about her being horny and wants the d. Is this what u call art nowadays. BS
Too bad we didn't fully  saw the surprise behind  nicki's black outfit
Kim é linda maravilhosa ❤️
This will be one justified mean comment directed to you, pointing out one of the biggest flaws with people purchasing adds on YouTube, and they commit the most unforgivable sin: making their ads unskippable, therefore here are my two invisible cents of mean but constructive criticism.  You want more people to watch your content? Make sure your ads can be skipped after five seconds. It's as simple as that and you don't ruin other people's days.  Therefore because you've done that infuriating act: making your ad music unskippable, here's my plethora of insults:  *You're a boring jingle who cause its company to lose millions in revenue.     You're an irreparable tire with which not even a tire swing can be made.       You're a useless charger that happens to cost thousands of dollars.        You're an unaffectionate grandma whose personality will guarantee a lonely grave.*  Most importantly, I fart in the general direction of your music and I puke in the nearest vicinity of your unskippable ads. Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries.
❤💗💗
Britney Spears & Beyoncé - Alone ❤️
i miss u so so much
1:20
The talent is astounding
Nice song. And the video is a success
that "click on a bitch 'fore she finish her sentence" is a freaking tongue twister
https://youtu.be/Sm-tD7Kwuvg
The actual lyrics meaning is so....😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🙏😿
Nicki Minaj ❤🎉
Can’t no female out rap Nicki Minaj
Nicki brought back the pink Friday Nicki nik flow for this one
Remembering 2013 hits 💦🤞🏽
The product placement in these video always makes me laugh 😂
No.
At first I thought this was a song from 2014😦
❤I listen to this song everyday
this music sound so much like play hard by neyo?
Catch me dancing to this at the summer night parties. Ayeeeee. 💃🏽🕺👯‍♀️👯‍♂️💃🏽
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The last part❤
Call her Kim petty ❤❤❤
How many 2000s music videos can you spot in this video 😂
A grown ass man trying to be a woman
I love Kim Petra’s music, but every video I’ve seen so far it looks like they skipped hiring a choreographer? Maybe she’s not a dancer but it’s very wooden
Nicki verse
Mentally deranged Man!
Trans excellence
Thats a man
Love this❤
Who would have known 60 years after WWII that Germany and not the United States would be the shining city in the sky exuding Inclusion, Tolerance, Diversity and Liberty.
GIVING KUNT 💅🏻
This better be on the radio next time I get in the car.
Thats prolly the worst song i‘ve heard this year. Sounds like a farting trashcan fr
Nicki  Minaj is the queen

😭😭😭SOO GOOD
kim is trying hard not to look like a male, although he is
This is giving me a super bass sequel like no other!
I’m sorry to offend any trans but I really have a big problem with it… but all I have to say is that they killed this we already know that Nikki murdered this and I swear the way Kim sang here you would think she’s a real women I didn’t know she was trans until this vid.. props to both them anyway
Captei as referências de clipes anos 2000
Lol kim go sit down lol I like this video
I love the reference to the to mid to late 2000s dance songs music videos. Takes me back to childhood ❤
Nicki and her new looks 💖♟👄🤘🏻🍒♦️♣️
Hard to believe thats a man.
Kim is not a Kim, more like Kam. Nicki killed it tho
This is so cute 🥰

This little boy was mutilated. Imagine slicing your little boys penis open to make a vagina! They slap plastic fake breasts on that LITTLE BOY. Nothing short of demonic.
I LIKE REAL WOMEN. PETRAS IS A MAN. AN UNTALENTED MAN. THIS SONG IS DRAG PORNOGRAPHY. And HE CAN'T DANCE.

Um Feat tão perfeito 😊😊
Maravilha magia
“Main character syndrome, they extras” that sh*t hit hard🔥
Alone❤❤❤❤🎉
Grandiose
Very Good 😢
I swear to god, I was and still am sooo excited for Kim. I remember reading about her when I was 13, in our Polish magazine for teens called Bravo. They wrote about her being the youngest trans gal to have had transitioned at that time. Since then I remembered about her from time to time and googled her to fing her acapella or garage band covers.Then her first singles like faded and I have always been a fan of her work. So I'm very proud. And I also like to brag that we're practically neighbours since she's German and I'm Polish (quite a controversial combo tho). lol
awesome Cover 🎉 #1 🎉🎉
Remember those 80's cardio  exercise videos ?
I never want to get rid of nicki. I'm so happy that she still make music, I never want her to stop. I want to see her forever until she's like 85 seriously!
This scares me . Says a lot about us as people

KIM PETRAS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE!!!! i love this bangerrrrrrrrr ... gonna ignore the bose advertising :P
Perfectttttt❤❤❤
De donde es el sonido? Yo recuerdo haberlo escuchado en otra canción antes
Diva ❤
Genial otra copia barata.
Instant classic.
She’s releasing a EUROPOP remix!
Good stuff.. 🔥🔥🔥
While original song "Better Off Alone" by Alice Deejay was a great hit in Europe and all around the world, this 2023 remake by Kim Petras & Nicki Minaj is a pathetic, sexualized garbage. What a shame! These so called "artists" are destroying the music industry.
nicky si literally on every feat song, I love the fact that she collabs with so many artists 😍😍😍❤️
Kim petras & Nicki ❤😭
Society is in the crapper based on these comments. This is just awful.
Was that a Tinashe cameo?
Tiene un leve parecido a ojitos lindos de Bad bunny 🤔
Nicki REMAINS THE BEST 💖
not authentic- using a voice box doesn't make one an artist or makeup as a cover
The beat brings back a lot of good memories 🎉
Nicki is a legend and has charisma and unique talent and performance. Bet's be honest, kim is just tacky. Nothing special. She has a nice voice but she's misusing it with that sexual overtone, and the lyrics is also boring and stupid. She's only being an another copy. Wish she would make advantage of her talent by making something meaningful.
Great song!

A turd is a turd no mater what Color you paint it!
I can’t stop hearing this song 😻🤭
Slayyyy
Is Thinashe on this video?
Honestly if more trans people put this much effort in being what they truly believed they are, a lot less people would have negative things to say. Honestly I respect and wish the best for this artist. I had to do a lot of digging to even know this person is trans and I think thats a good thing. (not my typical type of music) but serious respect
10 MILLIONS SLAAAAY
should've given nicki more time.
Cool 😎
✨Iconic ✨
Love this song ❤❤❤
Is that the same guy from Heart to Break??
....sooo a man and a woman make a music videk together

Wow 10 million we back on y’all stream
Truly I say to you, whoever hears my word (Jesus) and believes him who sent me (God) has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.John 5:24 Are people born gay? Do people choose to commit adultery/fornicate or are they born with a tendency to sin? Repent/believe or you will not inherit the kingdom of God. Jesus died for you.
Damn these girls have won my heart again
I can't understand why people are sleeping on this song!!! 😢
Nice porn with some song!

"Right now, there are people all over the world who are just like you. They're either lonely, they're missing somebody, they're depressed, they're hurt, they're scarred from the past, they're having personal issues no one knows about, they have secrets you wouldn't believe. They wish, they dream and they hope. And right now, they are sitting here reading these words, and I'm writing this for you so you don't feel alone anymore. Always remember, don't be depressed about the past, don't worry about the future, and just focus on today. If today's not so great don't worry! Tomorrow's a new chance. If you are reading this, be sure to share this around to make others feel better. Have a nice day!"💕🙏💗

Did you know that each year you age the day it lands is in order to the week. It used to be on a Monday 3 or 2 years ago.  Wednesday this year Thursday next year and the year after it’s on a Friday.  So weird right? Maybe it’s just me noticing it lololol
Sorry but this song is so slept on 🥱

Love this! The original song from back in the day was epic. I spent a lot of time on the dance floor dancing to it back in the day. Glad to hear sample used for a cool song. Love Kim and Nicki
If nicki ft it the song goes eat yu
THIS FLOPPED SOOO FKNG HARD, THAT'S WHAT U GET, WHEN U WORK WITH RAP*ST
THIA FLOPPED SOOO FKNG HARD, THAT'S WHAT U GET, WHEN U WORK WITH RAP*ST
I have to admit, this made me nostalgic, it is giving me 2012-13 vibe, damn I missed it so much!  Ps. I know david guetta released a song with similar tune in 2013. And that was a huge banger. It just reminds me of those times, those were good times🥹
At this point every so called artist is trying to sing about sex in the most creative way possible, like girl.....what's next? Cause honestly I'm bored of her so called "creativity"
Que grande sacanagem essa dupla entre Kim petras e Nick Minaj, esse som ficou cabuloso o toque é muito begajoso 😍🙏🏾👍🏾🤘🏾
The beats and music instrument seems familiar

I prefer Kims outfit to the Destination Calabra version, Bcuz in that you can see the panties from behind and so not a real skirt and I like a skirt and to see example of women wearing pleated micro miniskirts.

Alice Deejay did it better. Ten million times better. Her song, this beat, will forever belong to the 90s. Ya'll suck can't even come up with your own beats.

É muito emocionante ver que a Kim está tendo o alcance e reconhecimento que merece, tudo era muito difícil pra ela na indústria da música por ser trans, tô emocionada de verdade e feliz por ela! Sempre fui fã e torcia pra que ela conseguisse tudo que está alcançando atualmente.

The rythm in the start, where is it from!? I remember it is from a 2000's song  Wait.. all the song is a reference lol katy perry the clothes, that is awesome!!!

Nicki Minaj is not queen of Rap for  nothing. Imagine being this legendary 15 plus years in the game.
This music video kinda sucks not gonna lie, the choreography is terrible and I feel like whoever directed this was just looking for a quick paycheck.
Kim is also doing great y’all lol like it’s her song
Already!!

It’s Barbie nn it’s Kim Petras .😍
This is like coockies
iggy azalea 3.0 :v
hit of the century!! GREAT! I will listen to them so many times ❤
Sampling a song that you did not write, using an actual playable instrument as just a prop ( no clarinet sounds at all in the song ), and just focusing on sex the whole entire time either through dance or lyrics. It's quite terrifying when movies start to become real life...Idiocracy anyone?
Nicki ❣️
10M views let's gooo!!!
A remix with Chris Brown will make sense
they can have clear thighs all they want still bad  music
How much the did company pay for the intro loyalty haha
9 mil in 9 days nice
This song is sound like 2010s and l have no idea its so surprising me and it became my new fav
NICKI WAS STARVINGGGGG
Nice video, nice rhythm. But can we hear more songs about love instead of “i can ride it all night” ?
She so massively copies Charli XCX who is 5 trillion times more art
They just giving away music contracts to any and everybody these days. 🤨💓🤨 Nikki is flawless as per usual. Love that she's still out here grinding.
We need an official Europop remix!!
I don't need to complete watching the video..... when something is good we say it's good... uganda 🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏻‍♂️🇺🇬🇺🇬
1:48 for Nicki's part
THIS VIDEO IS HILARIOUS!!! Wtf.. A phallic clarinet... why...

Damn Nicky don't care. A song with snitch 9 and now this 😂😂😂😂 ..who's next .. Island Boys 😂😂😂
Hello👋🇺🇦  Great music👌🤩👍
I think youd be better of alone without this derivative crap.
If you want to be so blunt and explicit about sex, you can’t perform like this Kim girl lacking confidence and effervescence 🙄. Somebody get Doja over here to give some training.
I'm falling in love with Kim

Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone released in 1999 for those who aren't aware of the original.
Honestamente está Música terminara en 40 Millones en 5 meses, tenía potencial de llegar a 500 millones pero ya casi Nadie apoya 😢
Better Off Alone by Alice DeeJay is such an immortal song. Inspired so many other songs to sample it  and mashups. Incredible. 🙌
Love from Nepal ❣️🇳🇵
Left at 54 seconds in
❤❤❤❤❤
Nicki Minaj always the female best rapper all time this others r immitating the real queen
El mejor sample que pudo haber tenido la canción original es Play Hard de David Guetta pero está es pegadiza absurdamente
I'm only here for Nicki Minaj. Not for Petra
I like how most to all of these comments are about nicki 💀
Nicki to the world❤
Nicki is a timeless artist. No matter how many hip hop artists come up, her flow and talent are never defeated. She sounds great in every sort of song she wants to feature in. What an icon.
#Arte esta canción ❤❤❤❤❤

This is so bad
NM5 let's gooooooo
Kim Petras , Nicki Minaj and David Guetta？
This just propelled someones career. Huh! Kim?
lets aim for 15 m views in one month barbz
Can someone explain this trend of wholesale taking classic electronic tracks and just throwing new lyrics over them?  Is there something I’m missing here?  Because it just comes off as a lazy cash grab by the labels.  And before y’all come at me, this isn’t me trying to come after Kim, I love her…but like seriously explain to me what artistic value is being added by song such as this or “I’m good” by Guetta x Bebe Rexha?
I wonder who sponsored the video
La hubieras cantado con bebe rexha en lugar de la nicki
My love song <3
KIM PETRAS RELEASE A REMIX RN
Wait a min!!!!!! Is 2:06 pause TINASHE????

This song is so good❤❤❤❤
I love kim peters
Ким выглядит, как добрая 19-летняя соседка из Петрозаводска.   Трек огоооонь, дает мне очень много «женской мощности» (на русском конечно необычно звучит 😅)
i don't know if it's me or the music reminds me of 2011❤
My god its awful song
Yall lets bring this all  the way up to number 1 trending PLEASE!!!!😭
THIS IS SUCH A HUGE MOMENT FOR KIM PETRAS,LIKE I'M IN TEARSSS😭😭😭💗💗💗
I love how Nicki always adds her own flow but still manages to match the themes of the artists she works with .
15 years later and she still on top, that's what we call a LIVING LEGEND ❤
Nicki just has the flow.. she can literally rap to any song and sound different from everyone else even after all these years she's been in the game .
More than 14 years and no female rapper have outdone Nicki, she has one of the strongest fan base in history. She killed this beat per usual .
I'm scared of nickis mind because how do you put out consistent catchy bars over a decade without sounding the same, just incredible innate talent and no one can deny it .
Nicki's ability to stay relevant in the music industry needs to be studied. She's amazing .
Love nicki ❤❤
The fact that Nicki is still popping even with the new girls after all these years is iconic ! ❤
This song is so good! Reminds me of something that would have come out in the mid 2000s
Beautiful Queen nickie
Omg am in love ❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤♥️🇧🇷
Nicki is like fine wine
stream harder
You seem very excited to be with Nicki aww
🇧🇷🇧🇷
🤮   go back to the brothels and let the artists make music and their bulgarity leave them in the clubs where only the perverts go to see them
🇧🇷
Please someone remind me where that sample is from😢
uninspired and wack use of a sample on this track.  could hav ecame way more creative
That’s my first time to watch her music video of Nicki Minaj i am a big fan of her she’s my baby and i think I’m in love with her i am a huge crush on her

Hi everyone
01:48 ;D
Iam a metalhead but this adds to my guilty pleasures and ai I gotta support a trans sister LGBTQ+ fo life all hail our reign
Nicki minaj goes younger and younger
Heard this on the radio and got instantly hit with nostalgia. Combining old solid beats from the past to a modern day song feels refreshing to hear.
Nobody else thinks they have no chemistry? Like perhaps they were hired by their record label and didn't even record this together? They seem like fake friends , dont think they are having pizza night together anytime soon pls dont come for me lol
حلو
Where my German barbzzzzzz
bose really getting air time these days
A transwoman
Wait, isn't Kim Petras a dude?
mother didn't disappoint😭
Get Um Nick. Real Boss Sh*t 🔥️🔥️🔥🔥️🔥️🔥🔥️🔥️🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Love The Video and Nick killed It 🔥🔥🔥🔥️🔥️🔥🔥️🔥️🔥
This is just "better of alone" with worse lyrics and a soulless video.
In the beginning I hear a melody of NeYo - Play Hard ft David Guetta https://youtu.be/a2CTWkTQY6A
Party rock sound  is crazy LMFAO
"Alone" has fallen off the Billboard Hot 100 after 1 week! BUY, stream on ALL platforms, and request radio play!!! Let's get this song back on the charts!
This is the same crap as 10 years ago but with more advertisement
the roblox song
Nicki better rap til she 90😭 I rewinded her part 100 times already 😂
gracias por darme el placer de una versión decente de esta canción para volverla a la vida💕 sin duda, esta era la mejor manera💖
Damn this is lit
i am angry, perhaps vexed :(
lit esta canción me teletransporta a las vibes del 2015, lloro
very poor quality video, the singing was out of sync with the audio. I've seen Kim Petras sing, she can sing but this video makes it look like she's lip syncing. :/
Song of the summer🔥🫶🏻
El coro de esta canción te transporta a muchos años en el pasado ❤
The video is giving lil Debbie work the middle vibes
Nicki fuckng minaj 🫠🖤🥺🥺🥺
I wonder if Nicki ever gets tired of saving songs?!?! Per usual, her part was the only good thing in the song.
de cual cancion antigua es el sonido de fondo?
Meh.
✨✨✨✨
le me try to explain the meaning it's about s** ?
Collect your "before 20 million" certificate here
I love this video
THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTE BANGER!!!
Are y'all streaming?📈🔥
I'm trying to figure what this video is about. The visuals aren't really that clear.
Yeah the tune was awesome 12 years ago... plastic lookin women is grose.
How is this song not at a billion views?!
To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion. may peace and calmness fill your life.
So we gonna ignore how she ripped off Gwen Stefani, Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa and. Alice deejay? Girl, next...
I set trends from queens to bejing
kim is an icon
Que música incrível. Icônicas. 🫶🏻🫶🏻❤️
Miley was right about Nikki tho does she ever do her own music anymore,or is she always just going to be jumping on other ppls music

Guys, please try to listen to David Guetta - Play Hard ft. Ne-Yo, Akon. No hate, but Kim Petras uses the same instrumental and I think David Guetta version is so much better.
Love it ❤
Love this song, Nicki and Kim understood the assignment.
except for nicki's part, the song is trash...
Nicki killed it ❤
You'll find out in 9 months what the result was of listening to this song. Great guidance!

Just ho's.....Nobody cares about self respect anymore I guess but if you want a man to take you seriously don't let the lyrics of this 🗑 influence you. Act like a ho, you get treated like one.
Nicki Minaj ❤ whenever the sentencs *Nicki Minaj* I always love it. No matter what Nickiii ilyy from Indonesia ❤❤❤❤❤
The music background is similar with David guetta “work hard play hard”
So catchy!

J'aime trop le couplet (style, flow et rythme) de Nicki Minaj, il me rappelle tellement qu'elle est la meilleure rappeuse.
I love the way Nicki is popping with new girls
Omg kim ✨♥✨🌈
Wow… Sampling Alice Deejay and taking such an iconic song from the 90’s and destroying it with this mess. So gross. Watching a man parading around in women’s clothing and all of the over-sexualizing with objects makes this repulsive. This is what kids are listening to and watching in 2023 😒… tragic.

Music for really really really thick people... 👎👎👎👎👎. Fake music
Nicki is still giving good verses and Kim is going full dance anthem on everyone.  And just like that, everyone signed up for Band Practice.
Nicki made this song decent 👌
it's good, but it's not coconuts
How to ruin a classic dance song Alice dj you did this so much better 😅
WHY DOES Kim sound like she's shouting half the time?!?!... Thank God for Nicki.... Nothing special though, this song is boring honestly..

Nicki always a LEGEND 🔥🔥
nikkis dress is very good
U guys r dat hot@nicki
Crazy love the nails they are wearing in this video clip!  💅
Porn
the video is awful 😂
David Guetta - Play Hard
💥💥💥💥💥
Literally ALL of Better off alone samples are awesome. Nicki killing it as always and Kim being an absolute icon. 10/10 ✨💅
Classic retro musics running to worst nowadays
Beautiful voice by petras
My kwiinn Nicki Minaj.
An absolute original with a recycled beat & overly sexualized young women.
That beat is weirdly 2010's HWHAHAHHAHA
Cardi is Queen
Hommage a David Guetta 😅😅😅😅
i love it this song
Is she really trans
Muy perras 😭❤️
Loveeeee song 😍❤️
Amooo❤
Respect from Uzbekistan 🙂 I liked this song 🤩😀👍🏻👍🏻 Kim Pitras Nikki Minaj 👍🏻 🎵
I love u Niki
The spot is weird but song is good
most stupid song and a senseless video sampling a great hit from the 90s ! such dumb new artists always copying the original tracks ! there's no creativity these days shame on them
Me about to praise Nicki Minaj for dressing decent in this music video then boom her ASS is displayed 😂😂😂
I honestly thought the song would have like EDM bass drop at some point. In my opinion that would’ve been cool.
🔥🔥🔥
I thought this song was in 2003.
Needs promotion
✌
Yes
Am I tripping or is that Tinashe dancing?
This beat is so 2007
The Bose product placement….
😘😘
🎉🎉
Wahhh
TRASH 🗑
Feat Anitta pls
I’m confused on why this isn’t on the billboard hot 100 anymore??
Maee
Am i the only one that kind of see Roman! coming through a bit at the end with nicki face gestures?. i love it. To be honest, It would have been sooo dope if Nicki! took this chance to chanel roman in her verse on this song, and go off so hard and agresive with her voice tone. I mean roman is gay right, and kim petras is trans a due combo pack. i mean come on. MASSIVE. And nicki would have wear like i dont know something more masculine androgynous to give an image/ idea for roman etc... that to me would have been more iconic. i dont know. thats just me.
las escenas presentan a canciones antiguas , es una buena convinacion pero esperaba mas
Ya toda desplomadaj
Love this video 😍😍😍  !!!! Nikki is different she can rap on any beat 💅🏾
The trumpet is as useless as the G in lasagna... 0:13
queens
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm sorry but why is she famous? The song, singing, dancing etc 🫤 is she an influencer? Family are record label managers?
This is crazy, love the song, on repeat and grow so much in me lol Kim come to Mexico ! Loving this new era

" Click on a B before she finish her sentence "  🦄🙏❤
Nunca imaginei que fosse gostar da Kim Petras um dia 💛
Great sample of Better Off Alone!
Demons of the NWO, masonic puppets.
I fucking hate Minaj, she's like a monster
Sooo, she’s the new Ariana Grande, but without the vocals? Ha ok.
Do you believe in life after love by Cher I think is where this original beat comes from.
work hard play hard :)
That a remix
I love the Alice Deejay beat , feeling Nostalgic ❤
Fantastic, it was very cool,... it's very delicious to see and enjoy 🔥🔥💞🎶👍🏾
BOP
The exact same beat with David Guetta - Work Hard Play Hard
Por aqui
Vcs arrasam
Amo de mais❤
She's very nice 😢🎉🎉🎉 niki
Abatida dessa música não é dessas duas cantoras não gosteim
Yo con la motica 0:32
I'm gonna have to call YouTube tf out...this should be trending higher than this
"Alone" has fallen off the Billboard Hot 100 after 1 week! BUY, stream on ALL platforms, and request radio play!!! Let's get this song back on the charts!
Mh Bose commercial ?xd
Nicki with that red hair ❤🔥😍
LETS GOO
seriously? western pop artists really need to start coming up with their own melodies again some time soon. everything these days is piggybacking off of older songs, i hate it
A 2000s vibe, thanks Kim Petras and Nicki Minaj 💗
The music beat is also featured in another song, anyone know what is is? I can't figure it out!!!
Nicki looks stunning in red 😍😍
Rap verse onwards was good. This music video is stupid though 😂😭
😒 The song is so generic and the video is seriously lacking substance and creativity of any kind too. I really want my 3 minutes and 8 seconds back. I wish Kim Petras would retire because he has no talent worth seeing or hearing.
Kim Petras is a trailblazer. Keep shining on them beautiful!
I want you both🎉❤😍
Load off trash
Nicki carried tho
i will never forgive yall for letting this flop :(
WHO NOTICED A BRAZILIAN FUNK BEAT IN THIS SONG?? TANK U ANITTA! ❤
the beat is fire and the queen is still popin hot
is tinashe one of the dancers or am i buggin
When I saw that it was written Kim I thought it was Kim Kardashian 😅😅
Yo y las potaxies iconic en el 2023 escuchando está hermosura ❤
I love this song .... ❤❤❤❤
Nickiiiiii 🎉🎉❤❤❤
Nicki just never misses to slay but omg Kim has been giving banger after banger🔥
😮😮
Let go
Click on a chic before she finish her sentence 😂😂😂🎉.  Period.
omg❤ this song should be 3 on trending...🔥🔥🔥
Everything is "pornified" and everyone in the comments thinks the song is amazing. When will people stop glorifying these puppets??? Women cry about being sexually objectified but they still feel enjoy songs that promote sexual objectification...I really don't get. The likes of Nicki Minaj rap about being "bad bitches" but it's bad when a man calls you a bitch😂😂😂. These musicians are really turning millions of folks into degenerates 😢 I feel sad for all the kids being born from anyone who glorifies such songs
Kim Petra's is so talented. I'm a Barb I love Nicki Minaj she's a living legend. Hats off to them  Plus the fashion in this video is to die for 🔥🔥🔥🥺
Yaassssss😍🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️🔥‼️🔥🔥🔥🔥💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Play hard voltando depois de uns anos rs
Queen Rap Nicki Minaj!!❤
Love it!!❤

Don’t you dare disrespect Alice Deejay with this absolute trash
Props to @ Alice Deejay, Better Off Alone!!!! ❤❤
Minaj😢 the queen
Modern version of Better Off Alone
The music is similar to akon's song 'work hard play hard'.
OMG the VIEWS!!!!!! Come on Nicki and Kim!!!!
No começo me decepcionei pelo fato da música não ser uma farofa Europop, mas dps comecei a gostar e costumo ouvir frequentemente
i love Kimmy

the way the video is literally perfect for the song and pays homage to dance classics is perfection. They both look absolutely stunning!
Songs backtrack is a copy
Feels like Angel of darkness
The beat like insomnia by Craig david
Better off alone ALICE DEEJAY 1999..i like this song..
i think iv'e heard this song before the beat i'm confused
It's the instru of play on
Nicky is so stunning but kim so she is
Alice dj? Do u think u better of alone 😳
why does kim look super uncomfortable and can't lipsync to her own song :(
QUEENS
love the song aint loving the video  its kinda amateurish?
The gays really are winning
1:52 looks bretman but girl
🔥🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳❤️❤️

オートガイネフィリア

☺️😉❤️
It giving 2010 vibes and I love it🔥🔥
The queen at it again👑🙌🙌🙌
Well she did say it that these bi*ches are her sons, Nicky still slaying
😂😂😂😂
Why doesn't it say that it's a cover? The music is "Better off alone" by Alice Deejay.
alice deejay - better off alone ORIGINALLLLL
I don’t understand the hype about Kim Petras. I don’t see anything special about her. Only because she is trans? In my opinion she doesn’t fit in that business. You can see she has no star attitude especially next to Nicki
Here for Nicki
A něco nového není?
*Let us all express ourselves through the power of Love peace and Music.*
The only reason this song is hot cuz Nicki is on it
Iconic👑🔥
Your team is super
Horrific what "artists" these have done to classic dance tracks. They should be ashamed.
"better off alone" then wiz khalifa "say yeah" now Kim petras
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ive always loved you Nicki 🥰😘 keep killing the industry with your hit
I’m no hater , I’m still mad at how she did Trina even tho her team fkd up it wasn’t here , however Nicki is anotha Queen gotta give it ta her I like dis song it’s added
this is iconic
1:52 SIR BRETMAN IS THAT U?????
trust me bro i didn't come for ass😁😁🙊🙊
Queen Nicki is great as always
song is good, but the video doesn't match
Maaaann! Nicki looks so beautiful in that red outfit
Worst song of the year 😐
Gracias Kim por ser siempre fiel y leal á este gran genero pop bailable y llevarnos á esas épocas de antro en el 2015 y 2016, me llevaste á esos grandes recuerdos que pensé que nunca volverían, mil gracias por ser tan fiel á esas épocas y tiempos 💖✨
Both mid and cheap.
Barbz and kim petras 💋💅💅💅
Nikki always amazing as always
Meh, yet another boring song that recycles timeless melodies and tries to tiktokify them with instant-ramen noodle lyrics. An AI can do a better job.
This is the most award video I've ever seen. Why is Kim Petras so uncomfortable? Looks like they put her face on another body. In fact, the whole video looks like it was made by an A.I.
they know what they are doing
Out of this world.. Wow wow thank you.. 😎😀😎🎉
Nicki is the queen of all time no competition it’s on period 💯❤️❤️❤️🇰🇪
I love the sound of David Guetta -Play hard ft Ne-yo and Akon 🎉
Hey I’m not even 2 secs in & this song already feels like old times 🥰
wow😮amazing 🎉🎉🎉😍
🌈 MAGIC 🧚🏿‍♀️
apaixonante💖🔥
HAIL DA QUEENS 🤘🏿🤑👌🏿
The beat was so very familiar..
Anything that Nicki  touches they is 🔥 like no man's business. keep doing your thing 🔥I love her 🤟❤️❤️
I don’t like video  this song is cool
I hear Play Hard from this song, nice combo
Why have I feel like I have listened to this kind of music b4? Like the soundtrack sounds familiar
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
💗🎶🎶💗
100% PORN 0% EDUCATION
Don't forget better of alone guys 😢

Ficou ótimo ❤

Amo que Nicki apoye a tantas artistas y ahora le toco a Kim, ya que ella se lo merece a trabajado mucho para llegar a lo alto.
Who tf is Kim petras? Industry plant af. Selling souls like hot cakes.
😍😍😍😍
I te durne machanie tyłkami ...co to ma wspólnego z piosenką? Ludzie opamiętajcie się ...piosenka to piosenka ..a nie to co wokół niej tworzycie .

Using 2000s music and singing anything to make a song trash
I wish nicki's verse is longer because I love her outfit in here!
so random to see Tinashe dancing in the background... but love Kim & Nicki
No comment ❤❤
1:14 Anitta eres tu?

Old Nicki is back? 😤
Música e clipes impecáveis!!
Muito viciado nessa música, Nicki como sempre deixa as músicas melhores
OMG THIS REMINDS ME OF 2010s NICKIIII
Perfect combination love it ❤😊
This is definitely going to be on repeat for days to come. Hats off to the talented artist and their team for creating such a masterpiece. Who else is feeling the vibe?
I ❤ THIS SONG
Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone - if their are soooo talented how come they cannot make their own music?
Collaboration that never fails!
Music copied from akons Beautiful ?
Okay, I loved this song
His shoulder still firmly manly. LOL
ya the bridge is a little corny but i dont get all the hate on this song. kim should get charli to write 4 her
💯👌👌👌
❤❤❤
EU AMEI MUITO ❤🇧🇷
Yikes do I know you. Sheesh ! This a good song forsure. Elite platforms.
That beat is definitely familiar, what song is it from?
I feel disgusted and dirty. Let me go shower.
Essa musica bate um clima muito nostálgico vei😍😍
Flopped so baddd lmfaooo
I mean obvious industry plant
Why nicki why nicki mother of rap this is a flop 😢
what year is it.  the throwback vibe is real
Trans rights 💅
01:34: if using optical flow will make that transitional blur much nicer, 01:15: frame lost for that horizontal pan shot, also could use some plugin to make up for that lost frames. That's why some parts of this music video look stucky. Or could be the final export fps is not enough. Anyway, some obvious misses in the post.
omg this song is so true if u want someone so bad
Gross
Ridículo. A Enfermagem não deve ser Sexualizada. Errou feio em Kim! 🙄👎
Keep streaming “Princess Diana”❤️
This gives me an updated version of Starships from Nicki.
Im getting Alex Guadino and Eric Prydz and Kerli and Inna and Carolina Marquez vibes here!!!!! So many callbacks!!!
Kim's face don't move
mulher faz um remix
Pero es el hit del verano y así.
Wait, this official video was posted 6 days ago?? I haven't see any promo for this, wtf?
uff 🔝

Yeah but n you in doh?
damn this cover is pretty done well. very catchy
Nikki you are amazing, but please do better with your choice of who you let sing beside you.   Who is that even and how did Wayne think she should make a m.v. with you?    Can you please put more substance in your words and stop singing with these weirdos? You were the modern queen and should not lower your stage game.    Maybe consult a new writer and get Wayne off vacation     What's good tho
💯😌🥰🤗💥😁👍
They should comeback on making this types of songs
Auto like the video and the song was great! even tho I haven't seen it as long as Nicki is there its epic❤
iconic 🥰

I like this song!
Fun fact: this beat is sampled from a song called “Better Off Alone” by Alice Deejay
I really like this song....it was a great video and they looked really pretty and classy❤
What? Lol
Nicki a fashion icon 😍
Anyone else remember the computer commercial that was like “ do you think you really want a clooone” and then some guy adlibs ‘NOOO’ 😂😂
Do you think you're better off alone?
Seriously what the fuck happened to music hey...
Can you tell me the instrument of this song? Sounds so familiar
Stop the Bose sponsorship was so bad 💀
I feel like turn back to 2010 era. What a great song!🎉
STOP STEALING MUSIC
I love this song and wait the versión elctro ♥️♥️♥️♥️
There is so much energy here, extraordinary.👍💯🍀
Me gusta porque tiene el sonido de la original de fondo y me trae recuerdos 🍷💯
This is so bad!
I literally just watched this video 10 times in a row and couldn’t stop rewinding Nicki Minaj and Kim Petras part they ate up every scene together 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
This Is a simple rap like this song is simple. You can say no Nikki ,to some songs. This probably took 2mins to do in the studio. Come on ya stop
So ein Autotune Kack
I can't articulate how much I love this song. I feel like I'm in heaven, enveloped in clouds and the power of love. Nothing can bring me down from this elation. I'm just simply floating so resolutely in the ethereality of her voice.♡♡♡ https://youtu.be/rebU91cj1wU
O brasil🇧🇷 loveeeee Kim petras❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Damn I wanted to see more of Nicki lol needed a twirl or something 😏
I’m sorry but the original is still better 😅
Why this sounding like Chris brown forever in the background 😂
This Alone song is iconic Very early 2000s Kim and Nicki ate this song up
Nicki never fails she’s as hot as f🫠🫠k and the best ❤❤❤
İf Bart Baker ever comes back from his depression and chinese media. ı really wanna see a parody of this.
1 women 1 man 😂 😮
Who the hell directed this MV , its bad. And the song should have been mixed differently. Idk i was excited for it but it was kinda disappointing.
😍😍😍
The song has 0 drop, too bad
Recordar esos tiempos en donde Kim Petras era emo...
Un plagio por todos lados, ya no hay ideas originales.
Copiándose el video de Alex Gaudino
Too many chants
Nicki will never fall off, SHE IS THE STANDARD‼️
A Nick nunca me decepciona❤❤
Guys was is that tinashe dancing  during nickis part
If your a barb I love you with all my heart 😭❤️
Ok Kim
This is basically what ChatGPT would make if it was asked to make a “song to be popular” .
this song literally slaps but why is this music video awkward hahaha kim and nicki look gorgeous though
eventhough kim changed her gender, she still thinks like  a dude

First time I see Nicki dressed
Queen of the pop
Kim love u
Vibe 2010
🔥🔥🔥
How many times has better off alone been remade ? Didn’t Neyo and Akon do one not too long ago?
Love how nobody these days can come up with their own unique beats so they instead simply just remix songs from past artists who had a damn good song & they usually ruin it
My summer anthemmmm
Nicki😍😍😍❤️
! Is Good
Kinda sound like David guetta play hard. Am I the only one who sound it?
😉😏
Need good music like mine
👍😊❤️😘😘😘🇲🇱🇮🇹
:)❤
Like why licking that instrument? What are our kids learning by listening this song or watching it.
Lol 😂 the fact that this disgusting shit is normal blows my mind. Y'all sick
I hear kind of play hard by akon
2010’s mood ❤️❤️
Merece chegar em primeiro lugar na BillBoard Hot 100. Tá show demais!
I like this vibe it fire might have to smash a snowflake or two to this joint.
Il manque plus que Chris Brown ❤❤💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿

Only 6.2m views. 😂😂😂😂. Anything collab with Nicki Minaj will always flop.   FLOPNAJ.
The original of this song is ACTUALLY good. Not sure how they stole the whole song.
Oh em gee. What filth is this. Are music videos just porn now.  That’s Alice djs song they absolutely butchered. I hope children don’t watch this crap. Disturbing af.
This song is begging for some hardstyle remix !!
Great artists.
This porn not a song what a fucking joke
Song of the summer! 🔥🔥🔥
You have ruined a classic
Period
Queen nicki ❤

Good job my queen ❤🙌
Is it just me, or does this Kim person and her backup dancers look a little off in the face?
Nicki gives me goosebumps every time.
I wonder who wrote these complex and non basic lyrics
😂
of course, one can't please everybody, for specific target audience
She's new in the game but trust me she's already ruling the music industry
Chris brown 😮
10 mil millónes 😇🙏
The instrumentals is so nostalgic.
its the beat of Wiz Khalifa say yeah the first track Who Rememner This ?
Nicky dropped the beat, on fire
I love you Kim
If this song was uptempo it would probably be a hit
all alone!
kim petras!
Nicki looks so good and so as is her rapping.
I thought it's Better Off Alone by Alice Deejay. 🤔
Why does this sound like "Work hard, Play hard - by David Guetta"?
I love the song, and the Nicki rap is perfect, but, sorry Arrad, this is not your best work, I was expecting something different I can see to much from Gwen Stefani(Hollaback Girl) and a little bit influenced of Lady Gaga videos.
🇧🇷❤
If the song actually went off (which it doesn't), the video would be even better.
Soon we gonna be running out of  old fashion girls , you know the wombs
a summer bop !
6.1M !
Bora de 7 milhões até as 16 hr de hj!

Welcome to illuminati kim😂
Okay so this video concept starts of in term of sucking D and sex. Got it....
My girls slay every single time
Awww another one of my fav songs ruined to the new mainstream...I wonder what Alice Deejay thinks about this...girl they better pay you for this...everything is sex these days so sad...someone teach the new generation there is more to life please...
the music really sounds like play hard david guetta neyo. but this music pretty good
Crazy song normal.  0% normal
Tô viciado nesse som
Promoters circuits get back at highlighting there Artist .   Circuits are opening 2023.
Hope this will be trending...
it sounds like Play Hard by David Guetta and Neyo
First Alice Deejay, then Wiz Kalifa, and now these two! Love this song and energy, keep it coming!! <3
Amazing this song is everythingggggg xx
Cant believe 😅 David Guetta and Neyo Rocked All Music Charts With This song back in 2012 #Play Hard
Nicki Minaj a my woman ❤❤❤
I feel like this is so last year, the video especially
Kim tá linda dms mds 😍
Women sure have lost a lot of dignity in rap videos especially
Copia de varios videos,no se les cae una nueva idea!!!
WOW This song sucks 🤣
2023? OH come! 90's music video is better than this!
Work hard play hard
Kim Petras is one of the Song Actresses for Evelynn from League of Legends. This song would fit Evelynn perfectly. ❤
No Nicki, no pop 🐐💙💗 legends can relate 😎
This gives 2000 music vibes
That bear sounds very very very familiar, like it's has been used before and was quite popular. 😂
Love nicki 😢❤

Despampanante, en donde quiera que salga Nikki Minaj, resalta su belleza, y Kim hermosa 😍
Super waoooo el video ❤🤯💕💕🔥
THEY ATE 😢
QUEEEEEEEEEENN YEAHHHH
Another sexual song ... this version after soo many years its disappointing
Love it! Bringing back the beat from Alice Deejay's "Better Off Alone" (1999) and paying homage to music videos from 2000's hits: Alex Gaudino’s “Destination Calabria", Eric Prydz’s “Call on Me,” and Fedde Le Grand’s “Put Your Hands Up For Detroit"!
Gurlll I was thinkin that one back up dancer is the bhadest Bretman rock lol
Who choreographed this video? Come here boo 🔫
Ils se sont pas fouler pour la musique derrière PLAJIA
niki is queen
The intro song looks like a song Timber from pitbull and keisha
Old music beat mixed with this song. Mmmmmm
David Guetta - Play Hard ft. Ne-Yo, Akon
11Kth Commented 💙
Nicki never disappointed us♥
C’est une parodie?? On dirait un extrait de film parodie 🤨
Original still way better than this silly copy-sh*t https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgs9QUtWc3M :D
https://youtu.be/mdyG1N_kv3A

Was wondering what Stifflers mom was doing when she was younger
why is 「crying on the dancefloor」used？ please tell me！
alice deejay - better off alone           We have another shameless stolen song.
Showing her vajaj to prove shes a woman is so funny to me. Kim Petras you'll always remain a man. no matter the the surgeries you undergo.
Love Nicki she never misses and this is the first time I’ve listened to Kim but I love it…reminds me of the original song from when I was a little girl. Kim just need to work on her dancing and she will be perfect!
NICKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK UR SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LOVED IN THIS WORLD TRENDSETTER & THANK U MS. KIM PETRAS THE STAMPEDE CAN ONLY PUSH ITSELF! U 2 R GOATEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD #BARBZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ4LIFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 Such a warm-hearted Collab, I can trust Nicki & the fact that Nicki can trust our now Kimmy us barbs love your music totally, we love and respect GENUIENESS in the kingdom I mean the kind dom lol 🤣 Barbie & Ken are two kind-hearted, fun-loving people and I trust Kim Petras is PLUS UR NAME IS LITERALLY AMAZING 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Nicki will forever be great
Everything is about showing less clothes, and more skin toward sex.
Kim & Nicki ate this song up
music industry has sworn to humiliate women ... art has bothing to do with these se.x.ual movement...it s so cheap after all these years of evolution and women's status in the western world has decreased so fast that it has convinced sweet girls to earn their living by being soooooo cheap...if we go back in time...this was a shame
The instrument sounds like work hard from David Guetta???? 🤔
Poppin ❤❤❤❤❤
Horrible song. Sounds like a remix of 4-5 past bangers and the video a failed copy of the Alex Gaudino's Calabria one. If you're gonna do a remix at least be original.
Alice deejay - Better of Alone (1999), David Guetta - Play Hard (2011), Kim Petras & Nicki Minaj - Alone (2023) The next cover of BOA is expected to be released in 2035 stay alert
Another hit 💯l'm feeling the song.   What's your rating?
When Hollywood sings music that shapes, folds, and molds the youth minds…   Yea! A+ on dis shit

Just want to point out the first verse sounds like it's pulled straight from a Teierra Whack song. Cause I never heard that flow before. I like to point out swag from others.
Queeen

"Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness." Ezekiel 23:48  "Deste modo, portanto, colocarei um ponto final à lascívia e a perversão na terra, a fim de que todas as mulheres, isto é, as nações, fiquem advertidas e não se deixem seduzir e influenciar pelo vosso mau exemplo." Ezequiel 23:48
Nicki so good
I love this song so much ❤ thanks for this duo legend
I hated the way they cut the dark dancer out. 😢 they had her in the back where you bearly see her if it wasn’t for Nicki this song wouldn’t be hitting like that. Nicki bought this song out. Nicki was the only brown girl that was seen they blocked the black dancer out they had her so far back. Now I don’t like the song 👎🏾🗑
wonderful
PUSH BARBZZZZ!!!!
💕💕💕💕👑
How many of you jacked it to this music videos without knowing she’s trans?
Nicki slays
this is the most random music video ever. love the song tho
I love it such a vibe congrats on your collab with the queen 👑 my queen stay working 🥳🦄
Conexoes de mafia matue
Another voice lost in a boring voice. Same as all. Horrible.
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The video is wack at least Nicky didn’t disappoint on her part and Kim outfit slayed Can’t wait for a house mix to roll in 🎉

Essa música é perfeita, obrigada por esse hino ❤😊
São às maiores sem dúvidas ✨️💕
Aaaaaaa tô tão viciada nessa música 💕✨️
Such a lame Alice deejay rip off
1) Recycle content 2) Tits & Ass 3) Profit
I loved her so much, but now she's working with the old team of Britney... Fvcking disgusting.
❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
POV u don't knw how the video ends u kept repeating Nicki's  verse😢❤

Apaga o video, ta uma bosta
Rainhasssss 🇧🇷🇧🇷💗💗

It is the best song
The best, the barbie and the princess Kim 😘
Why does it look like Kim doesn’t even know her own lyrics in the video lol
I’m here for nicki 🎉❤❤❤
So iconic, the 2000s dance video references 😍
kim petras ate the choreo up but looks like she doesn't know what to do .. just standing there 🥲 camera presence needs some work tbh like look at nicki embodying that dress and giving us expressions, she was in character lmaoao
This combo🔥🔥👏👏👏 ladies I love this sooong 😭😭😭❤️

This song is a banger!!! Barb all the way 🎉😮

He looks thirsty

is that music stolen?
#55 on the billboard hot 100!! come on for more!!
اغنية رائعة ❤
How to ruin a classic tune in 3 minutes and 8 seconds.
I don't know why but this clip makes me cringe so hard
i love when nicki said she is not the one imitating
like nicki said she make 50k for verse no album out😂😂😂😂
It's a mix of David Guetta's play hard
Came to take peek and there is nothing here to see. Off to afrobeats bye
Queremos sim
OMFG this song is about to hit  top 1# i already know it i love kim petras and nicki  sm bro waiting on the concernt!
Kim in her flop era
I really like Kim’s voice. Smooth. #Nicki still a queen 🫶🏽
ITS BARBIE AND ITS KIM PETRAS
brings back that early 20's vibe NOSTALGIA
I was expecting a good a song 🫠
tudooooo
🥹❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is so bad
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
The Queen
Estamos presenciando el nacimiento de una estrella actual
Stay trying .
This is so basic. I prefer Art from Kesha
This is the most sexual Bose commercial I've ever seen.
Was that Nick canon🧐
I'm not saying this song is bad, it's not. But you can tell whoever tf Kim Petras is, she has no idea what to do on camera. Lol
Nicki Minaj had her first chart hit in 1950 before The Beatles & Elvis,  I remember it vividly, feels like she's been around forever😊
Queen Nicki spitting bars until this era❤❤❤❤❤ she is the best female ever to do it.
Bgm  Akon - work hard (David guetta ) Why copy😡😡😡
What is the meaning behind the marching band outfit in this music vid?
I love the original, but here.. they used the verse as the chorus and the verse didnt have any instruments at all? :/ what? They just turned down the volume of the chorus..
Not that original. Alice Deejay better of alone sample
The only miss in this videobis that I didn't get a chance to see the back of nicki's dress
Nikki part is the only good part, she ate and she’s beautiful
10 million lets goo
ELLAS SI QUE SABEN❤ REINAS
kimmi
Why is this giving 2012 pop? I love it so much!!!!
Anything with Nicki name on it will always be 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 and every single artists the she collabs with are always 🔥 themselves. Which is the only reason they were blessed with the presence of The QUEEN of Rap 🙌🏽🙌🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥
fire, love you Nickj🔥
🔥🔥🔥🖤
He Kim is a he
Tenía todo para triunfar el video pero no me gusto. Idk why. Creo es kim sus ojos su mirada no se. Igual el inicio del baile se me hizo súper ridiculo. Pudo estar 1000 vecws mejor. Eso si, outfits on point.
Another one
Ayo nickyyyy , Good stuff here
the aesthetic is everythingggg!! 🔥💕✨🖤
toda década sai um remix dessa música
Great BOSE commercial 😂 0:28
Loving the older video references too! Crystal waters -Destination Calabria, Eric prydz - call on me, Special D - come with me. Maybe even Kylie - Sexcersize!
Did Anyone Notice? The Melody was copied from Akon's Beautiful song and the flow was copied from Madonna's bitch I'm madonna ( Madonna's line i just wanna have fun tonight )
4K AND professional captions!? Awesome. Great job on the production for the song and the video. 💕
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
Not attractive 😜 Love you Nicki 💗 No matter what bottom you drop a verse with 🤣🤣🤣
Nicki carried
♡♡ call on me ♡♡ 🎶🎶🎶🎶❤
https://youtu.be/mGASEtYL_EA
Queen 🦄🩷 is working hard. Work ethic is ooo mwah! 😙❤👌🏿
This feels nostalgic but at the same time it's a new song...❤❤❤ #ILOVEITHERE🥰💓
I can’t believe this song won’t be on the hot 100 this week, where did we go wrong
I was waiting for this kinda songs 🔥
Someone has to do a fart version haha
Forever ❤️ Nicki ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So discussing 😏🤢
Am in love❤❤
Akon vibes!
this was everything i needed
I've been looking for music that reminds me of this 2010 spirit for a long time. And the surprise came to me in 2023.🎉
nervt so dass alle jetzt so songs aus den 90ern 2000ern mixen....... und auch Trance Sounds....... Originale sind die besten.
Back ground sounds like play hard David Guetta
1:55
Minios vida loka kkkkkkk
I think that song is "alone - alice deejay" 😯😄😍
Frustrates me she used same beat from Alice Deejay's song "Better off Alone." :(
Push ❤
Nicki Minaj Queen of rap
Original song - Playing hard by David Guetta, Neyo and Akon which is far better than this version. I thought may be Akon or Neyo was in it but I was disappointed. Lyrics are also bad man.  very disappointed to see this Iconic music from David Guetta gone to waste. 😠
This gives me 2010'ts vibes
I just can't...all my old ears hear is "so you think your better off alone"
👑🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎤🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤
This is what gays waited for so long. Good song, nice video, (Nicki Minaj back into the 2011’s) and Kim looking on point!  🎉❤
Song of summer
Nicki queen of rap!
❤️❤️❤️👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gesponsert by Bose
I got chills w/ Ncki's verse. This is a bop. First time hearing of Kim.
kim looks like she was born a female, you can tell she invested in her body. gotta love her even more for that! a real woman for sure 👑
Lixxoo
A Nikki usando summer eletrohits hahaha ícone que repagina as músicas antigas
Was hoping for something new; I wish these producers would stop sampling old music. Artists deserve more.
😎👍
This reminds me of when Nicki started popping 💖🥰. Absolutely lovely
I love you both girls 💖💖💖💖💖 this song is amazing 🤩
Everything is remixed now a days…such a let down…music doesn’t feel like it used to 😢
Club banger
the most stupidest song ona life time. give up music or you create sanity in the community. this is all pollution and a subversions. not the best for the listeners
Lol, Kim sounds so good. Love the fun, playful, sincere(?) sound she has. Breaking ground, all of these reactions and alot of people don't know Kim is Trans and the back up dancers too 👏 👏. Also the line, "Don't talk your talk, unless you going to back it up" while doing the stroking motion lol, CAUGHT THAT. 😏 🔥
nicki aynt playing around no more
Nicki and Kim killed it
Extreamly cute on the outside, beautiful voice inside!
Se você estava procurando comentário brasileiro olha eu aqui curtir 🇧🇷🤜🤛
Why’s everyone sleeping on this bop 😢❤️
I love how Nicki always haves her animated moments 😍😍💕
Mixing with Queen Rapper, you know how to say damn❤️‍🔥🔥take this Crown 👑Niki Minaj👑✨️
❤Forever love 😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is Kim’s song. Don’t forget that. Kim always makes bangers
Não vi mal nenhum nessa música
who is the background dancer with the short pink hair, she is soooo beautiful!!!
So no one is gonna talk about the lyrics 🙂
Sau 😂😂😂😂😂
This is the equivalent to packaging tobacco products in fun fruity colors..Kids have no chance smh.
Whyy this sounds like "better off alone" song?
Nickis outfits are always the best like did you see the back of it yessss slay 🩷🩷🩷
Powerful women ✊✊🏾
Obsessed 😍

The song is like David Guetta :0
This is a whole bop🥺❤️🔥
I can tell for sure that wiz Khalifa intro from let “say Yeah “
👍👍👍👍🙏
wait, was that Tinashe in the video?! 🤩
❤❤❤❤ I love this song
Bora 5 milhões até as 16 hr de hj
Came for Kim, stayed for Nicki 💯
Lame
Can we talk about the iconic dance song music videos referenced in this!?    Destination Unknown by Alex Guadino- for the marching band look.  Call on Me by Eric Prydz- for the exercise look Perfect (Exceeder) by Mason, Princess Superstar- for the exercise ball scene Put Your Hands Up For Detroit by Fedde Le Grand- the nurse scene  I know I’m missing one or two but this is amazing
Nicky minaj is not a name  . its a brand 🎉
SLAYED
Alice Deejay ( Better Off Alone) >> David Guetta (Play Hard) > Kim Petras & Nicki Minaj (Alone)
nicki ate
Gente que música! 😆👏👏
Nicki ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
Alice dejay
Nicki Minaj is real prove of "classical conditioning".  When Nicki Minaj started, she was bashed for being obscene and not a real hardcore rapper. She was accused of diluting rap and influencing negatively the younger generation with her vulgar approach.  Fast forward today, after a decade or so, she's being praise for being a legend, an OG of the game, super talented and her style is being worshipped. People hardly ever, in recent times, refer to and remember her vulgarity.  Moral of the story: when you consistently push something down people's throat it is only a matter  of time before they regard and appreciate poison as a magic healer!
Am I the only on that seeing them having that cool siblings that actually get along vibes??. ❤
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
,
Damn, this song video is enthralling, Nicki's always giving the best features  Nobody is talking about how Kim Petras looking like a Barbie character
Nikki just completing side quests at this point

🔥🔥🔥👏
Yeah! Fetish outfits are super!)
💞👑
I am literally just watching this back to back. I’m obsessed. It’s like every part of this music video is so perfect. I also love how easy the choreo was to pick up 😊 I’m glad I still have my pink fitness ball
Nicki ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yesss
This song spoils the legendary melody. CRINGE.
Garbage ! Get out of satan system and get in God system before it’s too late ⏳
Id never leave you alone ❤🎉
nicki rlly saved this one
Literally to lovely friends who's reading this, God bless you, and may your dreams come true, stay safe and have a wonderful day:)
The most basic/generic lyrics for most of this song🤮 Love ❤️ Nicki Minaj, I am a huge fan js this song is trash💯
Nicki on 🔥🔥
Nick minaj❤
Nicki 😘
❤❤❤❤
David guetta are u on hare?
Really creative with David guetta's work hard play hard sampling😅🥲
😮😮😮😮
Good nicki
Omg i loved iitttt nicki is the queeen
Do u think your better off alone .... loved my old jam
I hate to say this but I’m kinda disappointed
Did Kim Petras plagiarize Alice Deejay- Better Off Alone?  They sound very similar. Clones.
Another plagiarism song.
Kim Petras is working with BRITNEY’S ABUSERS.  Larry Rudolph and Lou M Taylor. She is not innocent. I DONT LIKE HER.
Well this isn't becoming a feminist anthem lol
Why still remaking old tracks music and instruments? Are stopped creating new music and instruments.......
i the Part Of Nicki Minaj...Boom🔥🔥
This song deserve the best
Kim 😍🔥
Isn't this just 'Better off alone' by Alice Deejay with different lyrics?
American music is running out of idea and keep recycling the old hits
Omg this was an amazing song, love u kim love u nicki
For the men lusting after kim petras just know that dude was born a man just like dylan mulvaney
Was waiting for the sex hotline number to pop up. What happened?
its good!!!
Chanson très efficace .. interprétation parfaite, duo juste fantastique , indéniablement l'un des hits de cet été 2023 🔥🔥😍 Nicki minaj toujours au top du top Grand Bravo 👏👏😍🔥
Nicki Queen in red leather & whip....what a bomb!!!
ate and left no crumbs, no restaurant, no chair, nothing left 😜😜💋💋❣
New songs are so horrible , only s*x and naked women nah and nothing masterpiece. I like Nicki but she only can rap in music videos not live. And another thing they copied famous song nah.She/He is bio that the hell i don't know who i can call this creature.
Glückwunsch Kim!! Geile Karriere hingelegt, mach weiter so
Not a fan. Oversexualized.
Nicki queen
Ta baphoo ❤
If you’re seeing this you’ve been hypnotized and this is your message to wake up, this is your only warning, go back or you will be dragged and drained. Go back.
Don't think about it KIM PETRAS is On Fire 🔥👄💗
Love Kim but this video performance is so OFF.   Her lip sync is horrible and she is so stiff in her dancing!   yikes
RUBBISH POP🙄
Uh ah
Good autotune to make this man sound like a woman
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pure fire 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
L O V E   Y O U   N I C K I

This was so fun to hear and experience the visuals 🌈🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 I’m here for it 🫡
Is that Tinashe at 2:06?
Just how amazing and queenly nicki is, she can bring back her previous musical style anytime, she sounds like super bass and starships days on this remix. Perfection 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Awful lipsyncing 😂 omg
Going to be the biggest summer 223 song! 🎉
Why are they jerking and air blowing the clarinet
Maravilhosa

Um cabaré ta tocando agr

QUEEN AND HER PRINCESS

Everyone proly gone love this song because of nostalgia...
Roube uma música mais antiga e estrague.. Mto bem!

WTF she really destroyed that song. 👎🏽 Terrible.
Zanzibar Stand Up for Queen burn everything down here............🔥🔥

Kim Petras she is ICON 🇧🇷
Amooooo

hi
I’m so mad at her label frr shoulda boosted this song more on radio
Ameiii essa música
This is the best nicki collab this year imo
This song could  potentially drop from the billboard hot 100 let’s make this song rise📈🔥 from the charts what happened to giving Kim another number 1? Let’s do it
Love this song so much and it’s only been 4 days
I didn’t know this came out
It sounds like play hard by David guetta
I was summoned here for Nicki Minaj 1:48 yow!
Imita las poquitas de la xexa
Kim Petras good new clip i'm alone too will be together!❤🇺🇸 this An Nick from Kazakhstan!
SLAYYYYYYYYYY
Streaming party come on barbz the biggest fan base in the wrld
If we stream everyday this could get hundreds of millions of views in a year
Were so close to 5 million let’s go
Yes baby 🔥
Queen of the Game forever❤❤❤
Do really 90%+ of all the new music videos need to be an introduction to PORN? Please, stop it!! Children will watch and consider all these dirty things as a sth that is normal. The end of this world is coming very soon. :(
❤👏🏼
Nicki on it again with Kim
Why the music industry have to be so dirty… she uses it for views? Is it the contract she signed in?  Focus on music more
Is this a sample? Sound very similar
🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤
Am in love with this fosho 😌 Nicki looking hot in 🍒 and Kim I love ur moves 🌹💕
Why most songs nowadays are sampling other songs?
i hate this so much
NICKI MINAJ OUTCLASSES KIM PETRAS, BUT STILL HUMBLY COMPLEMENTS HER WELL IN THIS SONG! I'M GETTING BEYONCExSHAKIRA BEAUTIFUL LIAR VIBES ... BUT x 10.
Such an outstanding choice for colab on this hit song Kim. Nicki Minaj just made me note u fr fr 😊
Alone forever ❤
first minute gave me super nostalgic flashback to destination calabria music video!
Me as an underground artist with a small audience, Nicki is the type of success story that inspires me. It's been inspiring to see how she's grown in her abilities and steadily exploded after embracing every chance she's been given! With good reason, She has swiftly become a hallmark in the music business. I know that if I work hard enough, I can eventually reach a wider audience, but for now, I'm satisfied as a supporter. It'll be my time next. Much respect Nicki🔥
Kim Petras ist immer gut
MINAJ = FLOP
I ❤ Nicki Minaj 🥰🥰🥳
This song is fit to the barbie movie!!
Perfeitas ❤
I love this song
Omg I love it!
Y’all this music video is not eating
the beat gives 2014 vibes

This is my first time listening to Kim Petras. I actually like her music

Illuminati all over this garbage
Me encanta ijuepuercaaaaa me encantaaaaa 😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
It's the ALL BLACK for me! Especially giving the world the Petra the world needs to see! ❣️ Also, NICKI is always going to be NICKI.. ❣️
do you think you're better off alone? do you think you're better off alone? like srsly people is there no one watching this video who was clubbin in the early 2Ks?
What is with these garbage 90s cover remake things. stop
I would rather stick to House music 🎶 This is too slow to dance to and boring. Maybe it’s for lazy folks ? 🥱
Nicky Minaj ❤
a bop
gross
“Brand new Range just painted it Betty!” That Betty bar tho😮‍💨🔥🔥 her pen not to be played with!!!!
The beat favors Nicki, same old music so amazing 😻
“Nicki ready! Yes we back!”😍😍 Nicki so animated and pretty🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nicki so damn pretty. Looking like 2014 Nicki 😍😍😍🔥
I'll be boogieing n twerking to this forever 😂😂 too much of a tune❤

Been rooting for her since I don’t want it at all ❤️
Try 🎵 Blair Woods 🎵 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎶💯🎶💯🎶💯
It’s crazy, it feels like just yesterday where Nicki Minaj was the new artist that everybody loved. Now, she’s the MC.
I wonder how Germans are reacting to KIM PETRAS ...why don't I hear anything?

Nikki is the queen of rapper because we all know even when nikki rapping we can clearly still heard the words carefully
2 icons
Nicki ate this shit upp, kim was also amazing!!!
I love it ❤❤
Is no one talking about the references in here? Eric Prydz, Ida Corr, Princess Superstar.. and is thst maybe a Sisqo reference at the end 😂
The song gives me old pop songs vibes era and making me nostalgic.this is fire
I love Nicki Minaj she is such a Badass, Long Live the Queen! And Kim Petras is pretty great as well So Pretty!❤❤❤💋💋💯
This video is actually soooo amazing. It really gave the song another look. loved it
Seriously,  princess Diana distracted the barbs.  Distracted me, i'm coming back to this song and I'm realizing how fire it is. I have in on replay. Nicki is so versatile, the Queen.
This is cringe to me but i love Nikki
Queen of Rap always on point
He still looks like a boy
anubis said hi time to collect - this blonde doll is now your queen and king in one- check mate- only the damned may punish the damned and only angels may punish all!

Ludmilla
Bruh THIS SONG IS SOOOOOOOOOO COOL 👀👀👀👀👀
Estou arrepiada. Essa música lembrou-me a minha adolescência quando comecei a ouvir nicki  Essa mulher é lendária
wauu! isso foi foda!🔥🔥
I don’t want to see Kim dance ever again lol. It felt more performative than effortless. Super corny. Nicki is the goat as per usual though
❤
Kelly Osbourne n nicki minaj
David Guetta
❤❤❤ Linda ❤️
Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone
man people had me thinking this song was bad. i like it 😭
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kim looks like she’s imitating nicki when she’s trying to sing rap lyrics with her. It’s awkward
#ANITTA

This melody is already known all over the world and super old. I just have a question, isn't copying a melody a crime?
https://youtu.be/Z0I1_GggPHg
Nicki 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Tão caricato e sem vida. Sensualidade Cafona.
This song makes me #orny
I'm in LOVE with this song
The queen 👑
Nicky is truly Iconic ❤
This is pop that we been missing
Old school Nick !!! ❤❤❤
Does anyone know the name of the bose earbuds kim has on her ears on the 0:32 mark? I liked them
Am I seeing homage to perfection, destination Calabria and Eric prydz call on me??? And put your hands up for Detroit 😯👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Sick.
❤❤❤❤
Sorry but this kind of oversexualized videos are not interesting at all or sexy...this is so..I don't even have words...she doesn't even move well it looks like a parody..and the song has the main melody that is from an old song that is older...I hoped for a good song and cool video
Perfect song 💗💗💗
Bem popzinha vcs tão tudo garotas,kim e nicki lindas parabéns 😚👠💖
We need a feat between Pabllo Vittar and Kim!
❤
Love
YES YES YES
Yay! They added the instrumental of Better Off Alone
I'VE BEEN TRYNA GIVE IT YOU ALL NIGHT!! WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE TO GET YOU ALONE???
Todo dia por aqui
I love them 😭
Aquí apoyando
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nickiiiiiii🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🦄🩰❤
So original. Taking Alice Dj song and adding your own nonsense lyrics to it and changing the beat.   Bad enough that Bebe Rexha, Ava Max and Charlie xcx redo old songs and ruin them but even they did it better than this
Nick💛💚
🇧🇷 com amor aqui do Brasil 🇧🇷
I’m a BARBZ no wait I’m A super BARBZ
Hooooot
❤❤
tbh...i don't like the video clip
Kindness costs nothing but means everything.
o clipe tá perfeitoooo
lindas
Le son et la vidéo sont trop bien faits.
Nicki Minaj ne peut pas donc faire un clip ou un show sans qu'on ne voye la peau de ses fesses ?
Love Nicki❤❤❤
Yeah its Barbie its kim Petras
Whats the original song about this ???
😱😱😱   🤩🤩🤩
GIVING ARIANA GRANDE MUSIC VIDEO 😮
"I've been trying to give you all night." Sex is overrated.
how does nicki just instantly make a song 10x better with a feature
Does Alice Deejay know you have her song...
ATE!!!!
MOTHER
❤️🔥
Brasil love you ❤🇧🇷
Queen
Sucker punch 🤔
i know this beat who can tell me the name of that song?
I like that 😎
I only care about one thing: Does Kim Petras still have his testicles?
What is the song this is sampling? It sounds like something from the early 00s or late 90s but I can't quite place it...
now here’s a girl who knows what she wants.
Este video es perfecto es tan adictivo todo lo que hace Kim petras 😍 es tan sexy
nice song mélodie en bas pleins de souvenir 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Kimmy bad (Bad) Nicki ready, yes, we brag We throw jabs, bitch'll get dragged We be like, "Gag," call her Kim Petty (Petty) When I r-ride it, I ride it steady (Steady) Brand new Range, I just painted it Betty (Betty) I set trends from Queens to Beijing ('Jing) I'm not the one that do the imitating ('Ting) Puff, puff, pass 'cause you know we blazing (Blazing) When I put it on him, he say, "It's amazing" (Amazing) All this cake, he doin' a tasting (Tasting; mm) I send shots, get ready, they may sting (Brrrr) I-I-It's Barbie and it's Kim Petras (Oh) Main character syndrome, they extras (Okay) We-we-we ain't answerin' questions (Uh-uh) Click on a bitch 'fore she finish her sentence (Sentence)

Czy teraz każda nowa piosenka będzie bazować na bicie starych hitów?
I feel like i heard this  song before
Nicki with the bars, so dope 🔥🔥
Nicki doing the same rap over and over 😖😑😴😴😴😴😴😴
😍😍
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
It’s like we forgot one of these women married a convicted rapist, and then harassed the woman he was CONVICTED OF RAPING. But its cool Kim. The check cashed the same way didn’t it? You’re a discount Britney Spears.

Arteeee
Non talented
The Yuhua Hamasaki move is perfect.
I used to believe that Nicki Minaj was super trans and homophobic, but now I see she's not)?
Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone, this is why it sound so familiar. They use a sample from this song.
Nicki is just forever!!
Can't stop listening to this banger😩🫶🏽🩷
5million let’s go🔥

QUEEN NICKI
The message of this version is vague.  I love the original version "better off alone"
🤪🤪🤪😋🍆🇦🇺
My ringtone🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nicki🥰
akon ft colby  beautifull vibe
Nicki ate that🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm slayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Nicki dressing code is on another level 😘
00s are really coming back
damn shame this song raw lol smhhh
Kim Petras just have slipped through some gray zone in order to get into the industry… SO bland and not even pretty. I’ll never understand this choice by the machine
Nicki ate that soo good
A song that originally talked about getting together with someone you like into dickriding all night. Disgusting.
Barbie and Kim petty ❤
that is some seriously terrible lip syncing from kim, like the vid and music but jeez they could have tried a bit harder with that
Still can't get over the fact Kim Petras is transgender...
Trini gal does it period Queen Nicki
Really wish Nicki's verse was longer
This tune is similar/copy from Akons song "Beautiful"😮
Nicki is undoubtedly the goat
IS THIS REAL?? WTF I SWEAR I HEARD THIS BEFORE 😭😭
I THOUGHT THIS IS YEARS AGO?
This song sucks lol
David Guetta Remix?
The tempo on this sing💥💥💥
This is gonna sound weird but kim petras just gained my respect with this song nicki and her killed it😂
Nicki n Kim are so cute together. Nicki really came in pop in ready on this. I’m thankful to actually get to know this fan base and also her music.  Shout out to Kim Petra’s pushing the barriers 💯It’s crazy how wide the web is but we all don’t come across the same things sometimes. I grow up loving hip hop rap and pop in no order. The sample was done justice in my opinion and it’s feel good music listeners want. I’m here for vibes and good music 😮‍💨💪🏾🔥
ateee
Sodom and Gomorrah
❤❤❤
Nicki's verse can kill you with orgasm
Smash hit song of the Summer! This is why I love Nicky!❤ Much love from Kigali Rwanda 🇷🇼🇷🇼🇷🇼
Love the old vibes! Alice Deejay!
Good ilove you
Nicki so fire 🔥🔥🐐🐐🐐
i thought i'm hearing work hard play hard by david guetta

WHEN I HEARD THEY WERE DOING A COLAB I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS SCEPTICAL. BUT THEY ACTUALLY PULLED IT OFF. CUTE!!!
It reminds me of 2015🤔😍
Omg yess
It’s too Short Nicki 😂😂😂Literally you verse should last a life time ❤️🫡🦄
Klingt, als ob es anfangen will, aber nie beginnt.
Nicki Minaj Is Very Good When It Gets To Feature”s She Can Own Da Song 🎧 😂😙
Mais c’est horrible….
I see nikki i like
thats the exact same beat of David Guetta - Play Hard ft. Ne-Yo, Akon that was released 10 years ago! maybe #Musicplagiarism ?
Kim looks like the other side of Iggy
AMAZING
❤❤❤wow sexy lady ❤❤❤
🤢🤮
Nicki baby ride on I love ur lyrics❤
Wow
Nice duet who agree 👇
Wow So Beautiful!!! Kim petras ft Nicki minaj 🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘🔥🔥🔥🔥
The back ground music reminds of work hard play hard song👀
👌👌👌
WOW!!!
Play hard 🥰
Is that an ad for Bose earplug?
Queen Nicki 💖👑
Einfach krass 🎉❤
I like Kim Petras and her voice is really great, but i feel like these kind of songs dont fit her. And it feels like there wasnt much room for her to show her voice.  Plus, there are moments where she doesnt look as confident? Or comfortable?  Again- i realllyy like her voice, but these songs dont do her justice.
Nicki is relentless girl! 🔥
embarrassing. Petras has nicki minaj collab and can’t even go past 3 million views 😭😭💀
'it's barbie and it's Kim Petras' 🎀🦄🎠💗
Its bose audio commercial tbh, i love nicky minazzz.. ❤
can someone tell me the one make the loop part?  I heard this loop but don't know the artist
Alice DJ has left the chat
Barbie all the wayyyyy💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Nicki Minaj is the queen of rap
🔥🔥💕💕🔥🔥
Im expecting the beat drop but they slay
흥해라 노래 너무 좋아요❤❤
So, Nicki and Iggy finally did a duet?  Next with Lil Kim or Cardi B 🙊
Manumber manyama aya #@goodvibes daddie speaking

The beat is from DAVID GUETTA Song "PLAY HARD" ft. neyo
Nick ni legendary. I'm glad i was here
waiting for the infinite mash ups of this song and the original at festivals :)
I never knew Kim was trans.... I would have never guessed.  Happy for her though.  Reach to the top babe.  And you rolling with the QUEEN. you're a star.
That familiar tune is from: https://youtu.be/Lgs9QUtWc3M
Kim is the revolution
This track is old....WE DONT NEED A 2086578TH VERSIONNNNN....GET YOUR OWN IDEAAAAAAS
nicki is so iconic

Clipe cheio de referências aos clipes de eurodance dos anos 2000 muito bom ❤
we have gotton 4 songs in 5 months from nicki, 3/4 have had videos and still on the hot 100! 15 years in, nicki and the barbz will be studied and looked back on in the years to come cause this kinda of loyal support and interested and influence on culture is honestly gobsmacking, the talent this woman has is amazing
sdds de um clipe pop bem produzido e a música é bem vibe old pop. gostei tanto ❤
I simply love the vidéo 😳😍
Love this song shout out to Kim Petras and Nick Minaj for this amazing song 🔥🔥🔥🔥

this song is unbearable apart from the nicki verse. really disappointing.
Kim ateeeee real pop vibes and this has an old school new school vibe I love it. The theme is 🔥
slayyyy kim petras❤❤
nicki não decepciona 🔥
🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Sad and pathetic that youth today think this debauchery is good pop music. A trans dressed and acting exactly like a porn star doing filthy things and lyrics that are disposable. Them/They are literally farting into a microphone using Autotune to resemble a sort of singing voice. Wow sad future music is heading into. Oh well it's making money that's all that matters it seems.
What genre is this? pop?
Never get bored watching it ❤❤❤❤🔥
the most underwhelming song of 2023
👑👑👑
GO BARBZZZZ !!! 3MIL TO GO 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Instrumennya tuh kaya pernah denger ya, apa ya namanya
So CUTEE
I love this Collab❤️🔥
Nicki is soooo good ❤️❤️❤️
Amooo elas resgatando  um hit é tipo a nata do pop reunida ❤

This is so colorful & love the past references  Nicki ate her part! she is a star!
sin duda nicki sigue siendo la reina del rap
Surreal saber que a Kim Petras já foi homem um dia. A voz dela é bem feminina
The song is really good but why is on the tune of David guettas work hard play hard?
my first time watching the video, i love it they nicki looked so good 😍🥰 and so did kim
Queen 💯👑 she bodied these haters plus shut them all down ,get out way Queen coming thru ok period.cardi it's over for you .sorry

This might be the next big 📈sleeper hit it’s already 55 on billboard hot 100 let’s get it to top ten🔥
So, first dr luke and now Larry Rudolph, who’s next Lou M Taylor? You like to work with really nasty people 🤮

ALONE 🔊
This music video has that early 2000's vibe to it💯🔥🎶
Y’all can’t say nicki didn’t eat
I’m so happy she’s doing a song with a lgbtq artist and nicki ate per usual
❤
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

Love bendición desde República Dominicana
Kim, sos el futuro, AHORA ❤
EW....not music.
Nicki la reina
Love ❤❤❤
The extended version should of been the original version. Sorry not sorry
the vma's this year is all her
Good melody, good sounds in general, but it's empty!
Nice song! but it was still unnecessary with the BOSE headphones, right? In my day, sets were called Sell-Out. Don't want to be mean, but think it's ruining, you have money so it's enough anyway? Yes yes, keep on rocking anyway 😀
Toooop lan stre
This is literally the anaconda music video lol
Amoooooop
I remember seeing Kim on German TV yeeeeaars ago and look at her now holy shit what a huge career jump. It's so hard to get noticed in the US music industry if you're from a non-English speaking country even if your songs are in English. Im really happy for her ❤️
QUEENS
All these people in the comments passing transphobia as “edgy.” How depressing! She’s a great vocalist, she’s getting the recognition she’s worked hard for.
Omfg how sexy is this!!! So 2000 vibe! I love this!
Wow
Kim and anitta pleasee !!!
This song is so good !!!!!!!
😍😍😍que temon con Niki saludos desde 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
ok, after watched this, im gonna watch play hard
This song is so nostalgic ♡♡
Aí eu gostei

This reminds me of Nicki from pink Friday.
I love Nicki , I'm only here for her but all the song is also amazing and catching. Good job Kim.

So good! Both Kim and Nicki killed this. Reminded me of Nicki's old releases that had more of a pop/edm vibe
que problema
Mother ! Nicki🎉 👑
Queeeennn❤ it’s the voice for meeeee
Women be making a career off there body, if they weren’t good looking with a good body they’d have nowhere near as much fame as they have. It’s sad and dumb. No talent, just body.
Yeah 🫦🫦🫦🫦
i loveeee kim
freaks
I miss this type of music 😭😭😭😭
Que temazo Dios mioooo las amo tanto ❤
Did anyone else notice that Kim Petras was showing off a pair of Bose Headphones cause I know there is a company who owns those and I think she just did that to show them off
Love nicki's red look
mulher lança uma remix logo pq minha nossa senhora
what a trash song of a remix jeeeeez pls stop
They should have gave this track to Ariana.
Y the music same like neyo and guetta's work hard play hard
I’ll never forget when Nicki said when she does a feature she really does her best and gives that person their moment. And it never fails.
Nicki's verse FAYIAAAHHHH
Kim is that German transsexual
The whole thing looks like it’s out of 2012
É hit !!!❤

Who else felt David Guetta vibes "play hard work hard"
I can ride it ride it ❤❤❤
Nikki Minaj just completely sold her soul. Supporting this, her ex, and exploiting lil miss ice child... wow. And she claimed Polanski? It's giving Degenate - I mean Degeneres 👀 #no false idols #shepickedaside #thefrauds #thelost
If u wamme lemme know ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑
*so I love this song everything kim do is amazing but I have a serious question was that the amazing talented singer writer dancer extraordinaire and one of my underrated music faves tinashe being a video girl / background dancer because if so im about to be mad at the music industry*
Music work Hard play hard
it’s barbie & it’s Kim Petras
Omg yes 💖💖💖💖
Man this song gives me that 2007 - 2011 vibes ❤️❤️❤️ I’ve been missing this kinda song for so long.
This gives me 2015 vibes
Nicki up you on the stage and you be famous 😂
2 MILLION IN TWO DAYS!!
Kim Petras and Ariana Grande's music contrast with their faces, they look so innocent but they're not... 😂😂😂 Love them
Jesus forgives
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Se me hace algo familiar el instrumental pero no me acuerdo dónde lo escuché antes. 🤔🤩😍
Square root of 64?
❤🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥹👑👑🤧
I don’t want Nikki to get old who could ever replace her?? 😭😭
What a lyrical genius
The Nicki impact is ridiculous. 2million in 2 days??
que bonita voz tiene Kim
Work Hard Play Hard 💅💕💋
So boring
Nicky was so good with ice spice but with kim petras is damm it's amazing 💕😍
Tinashe 2:06
nicki killed
0:48 Someone tell her it's a flute,  not a skin flute. 😂
This is a really fun, catchy song. I've been streaming it on Spotify since it came out. Kim and Nicki look and sound great together!
Video is fire 🔥 this
Thirsty much?

Yes now I understand feminism and female empowerment.........its an excuse to where the sluttiest outfit possible and fuck a clarinet!!!
BARBZ PUSH PUSH PUSH!!!
YESSSS OMG FINALLY 😆
I thought they would learn from the bud light commercial but bud ain't wiser till u have a period or can give birth u ain't a woman, if I put a Cape on I ain't superman, I'm surprised more women dont get offended by tyraniies
Wowwwwww Nickyyyyyyyyyy♥️🗿
Kim!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
one of the best remixes ever. I'm so glad petras got away from sam smith. he was ruining her muscical career. Keep doing you petras. it's working for you. Thanks for not having a bunch of distgusting things in your video.
My Queen 👑😘 Nicki Minaj never give up 👉😘😘😘👑👑👑💞💞💞
Geht‘s da um‘s romantische Bumsm ?
This is my new favorite song 🔥🔥🔥
Love love song ... latinos present 😍
Nicki is all time fev ❤❤❤
the only relevant part is the alone sample, that's it
Work hard play hard vibes
They sampled an iconic song for this trash????
Nicki with Kim "the guy" lol 😂
glad she didn't abandon her Era 1 sound. luv this.
Where's the drop or beat Remix?
I don’t like the way Kim Petras dances- it looks stiff and unnatural…it just doesn’t flow smoothly with her, like she’s new to it or some kid girl dancing on stage in high school for some concert. Bad dancing. And she’s someone who looks better more clothed
It's something different about this nicki verse comoared to others idk what it is
Alice Deejay " better of alone "
I want a live performance!
That sample again? The LACK of creativity and innovation when having all their funds is just disgusting and I swear to God I'll never play this song again.
Addicted!
This a catchy song. I can’t get it out of my head.😻
Im here because of Nicki minaj
So profound...
Da way she said patruuuuuuus 👌
Work hard play hard remake right?😂
Puff puff
Red hair is everything
The fact that all the comments are about Nicki 😂😂 sorryyy Kim
kim petras really has dick?????!?!?!😢😢😢😢😢
2:53 I missed that Nicki
Alice Deejay :Better off Alone!!
#Nicki #QueenOfRap

Best forever❤

Viciado na música e no clipe 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don't know why but this song just gives me nostalgia
❤❤❤
They both look sooo good
Wait is that Tinashe?
It's giving me 2012 pop music era
❤❤❤
damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn nicki you look real trini in that red out fit

❤️❤️❤️💞💞💞💞
1:47 nicki’s verse
Ek number hai 🤟🏻
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMG THIS SONG
ME ENCANTOOOOOOOO!!!!
BOP!!!
Nicki is the greatest female rapper to me
This is a really well-done MV. I love that the ladies are so confident and beautiful. This may turns out to be over sexualize them but it didn’t! This somehow reveal their love desires in a fun, cute but still mature and active way. I love it when the girls are liberated to show their feelings like this.  That is what I find amazing about the video . (Plus, cute outfits ^^)
Mother and...MOTHER?
I love you Babie queen ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶
Nicki is so passionate about rapping !!! She always come through !!
Keep it coming like lava ❤
She’s been trying Dick him down all night
20 million, Let’s Goooo
I can’t believe I didn’t know Kim Petty Petras till now. On repeat ❤
I wonder what or how much they have to promise female artists to sing these lyrics and do this choreo. Just sayin. Nicki's verse was cool, nothing crazy.
It gives me Side to Side and Anaconda music video vibes❤❤❤ slay madame 🥰😘
german princess of pop <3
everyone email your local radio station and get them to play this xo
<3 <3 <3
20's vibe 🏄‍♂️❤❤❤
Kim is mothering
This song deserve the best
WHY BEAT IS DAVID GUETTA's Play Hard ??
Kim sounds like Charli xcx
The music take me back to 2012 vibes 🔥🎉
This no hate but i think i already hear the music before
What the name of the sample song
NICKI IS OUTSIDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Hello boy
this is so 2010’s!! it’s a vibe for sureeeee
Gente ja era pra está em 5 milhões.. O que está acontecendo ? Será que o YouTube está bugando as visualizações? Esse hino merece ser Hit ,quer dizer já é 🥵🔥😍🫶🏽🇧🇷🇧🇷
Work hard play hard steel hard.🎶🎶 Dose anyone get it 😂😂😂
Cantora não e sim Puta
Is that the dude who thinks it’s a girl?
Awesome.  I miss these type of edms. More please
NICKI'S OUTFIT IS TOP TIER
hip-pop makes me wanna hop .. the beat issa whole new level
Who is the random dude sitting there looking like this is blowing his mind and has a remote to the TV that they are in (sus symbolism but OK), it like cuts to him a couple of times and for some reason i feel like have seen him before.
NAH
You stans are lying in these comments, because this is a flop..
Vamos por el millón
Manifesting a Kim Petty & Nicki feature when I get in the music game! Still so proud of this video 🔥🔥🔥
Que musica incrivel
This song is actually growing on me ❤
this is fkn embarrassing..8 weeks.. no one will remember this shite
Original tune, no sex, no boobs, no ass, just pure talent 😅
Background dancer #16 do a spin
Very familiar to Nicki's Anaconda (aesthetic wise/props esp in beginning) so Petras was definitely inspired by Nicki's former work. Please give Nicki her flowers 💕💕💕💕💕💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾 #nicecollab
I love the fact it gives 2012 vibes and nostalgia ❤❤❤sweet feeling
I love everything about Queen but whoever did that bang for her needs prison time 😅
All night long 😂
Here from Uganda....sending much love to the king of rap#nicki❤
Very boring to see record labels re-use old songs to just keep some of their artists above water
another sample...
if I were the wardrobe people, I WOULD BE PISSED!!! how you gon put Nicki in a black backless leather number only show half a second's side view of it at 2:25?? Missed opportunity right there.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
2:42 pensei q ela ia tirar a peruca
New song....hell no
A mina lambendo a clarinete vai cantar muito

Can we appreciate two things. Kim is clearly enjoying herself and I love it, and Nicki ninja is finally over her “I only green screen into videos” era ❤️ great pop music and no more lazy rap artists, music is healing
❤❤❤❤❤
yeah, no
💯🎧
Who is Kim petras?

The music has been taken from  " David guitta / neo ft  akon 2014" ,the original is amazing

Venia a ver que tan malo era el tema..
2:30 Kim Petras Doctor 🏥
Wow this is goals 🎉😍
When I ruh rideee it I ride it steady 🔥🔥🔥

I love the beat of the song. It reminds me of David Guetta, Akon, and Ne-Yo's song "Work Hard, Play Hard".
ITS BARBIE & KIM PETRAS
Me hubiera gustado mas sin el sonido de fondo  Ya aburren queriendo plagiar canciones viejas
A batida da música lembra a música do ne-yo com FT Akon
I dislike this kind music and video it should add age restriction because kids and easily watch this mature videos. This music is a repeat of a previous good top song and a constant remake from music industry for the last 10 years i guess singer cannot think of anymore lyrics so this try imitate other famous songs.
Ese ritmo ya la an sacado como en 20 canciones más ya aburrió caray
This is on the explore page for a bunch of kids to see🤔
KIMMY ATE THAT!!!!! AND QUEEN NICKI AS WELLL
Não gostei do clip a música só e boa o refrão 😢
🥰❤
OMGGG🔥🔥🔥🔥
The video vixen is fine af! The music video is better than the song by itself
This is so addictive ❤❤❤
OMGGGG KWEENS

Man I swear it was Nicki on the background vocals at first.
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
❤ iconic
You guys saying this is a hit song and it’s super unique… lol you guys realize this is just sexualized lyrics added to an early 2000s beat.
0:07 THIS SCENE IS JUST >>>>
Büyük hayranlıkla izliyorum kim petrası ❤️

Eattttttt Kim…. So pretty !!! Got your Nicki feature ‼️‼️‼️ the trans dolls should be proud
kim looks like kylie jenner without lip fillers
this was too short!
Kim Petras is so gorgeous and I love how Nicki always does the playful choreo with whoever she’s collaborating with. Super cute ❤  I LOVE YOU NICKI  & both you lovely women did beautifully
I hate the fact they used this sample
shes talking about me
Don’t get it twisted this is a banger !! The fact Nicki is on this song shows Kim is finally blowing up ! Long time overdue ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏
Was that Tinashe dancing?
Who is the guy of the video?!
Ok but serayah in the background dancing is givingggg
Genre after genre, Nicki Minaj has given and given us so much music to love. No one's more versatile, man, woman, or anything else. She's the best, no questions. Hate all you want, she's the best by far!
Kim's always been awkward and try too hard and it shows in every scene with nicky pettyphile who also looks desperate to be sexy and a hit with the younger generation, sorry granny, we have cardi and meg, go feed papi  cub
Uhm... I not trying to be the asshole in the comments... but that video was very cringe. And the song sounds like its copy paste from 2008... sorry. 😬
The video script are inspired from the movie Matrix
Tem que estourar.
Bora 2 milhões
Essa música ficou maravilhosa. Tô viciado…
This song has that nostalgic 2010 vibes
Love it!
This is a disappointing release, highly unoriginal from the poor sample (if you're going to use Better Off Alone, an iconic 90's dance anthem, you better nail it), to the generic lyrics this just doesn't impress and is not at all memorable. I like Kim and hope she has continued success but I think she can do so much more than this very average effort.
This shit is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m here for ONIKA💕
Is Kim Petras a new artist or has she been famous for a while?
Oh dear, this is awful
l ' so is beautiful ammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm love this New  song of yours Kim Petras never disappoits us this is amazing love all the esthetics of the  clip, love all the looks the mackes the color ft with Nicki Minaje etc.. the lyrics l don't even comment.Thanck you so much
Okay
Nicki be murdering anyone who thought they were competition.
Slavery is legal and censorship is banned.
Hm not sure I’m a fan of the sample but I like what they did with it; the song is ok, but the video has a few awkward duds, not sure what is happening to Kim’s camera Interaction here but she is kinda losing it; she looked awkward and if she didn’t know what to do in some parts….she is vocally talented but has been losing me lately. Hope her newly recorded album charts well and ensures her a more established career; what she did on Clarity was major; hope this lives up to it.

BFFR 😂😂😂😂
WOW 🔥❤😘
The product placement 😂
Oversexualized as usual
How can you so blatantly still the main theme from another song and shamelessly ride it for money. This to me just show lack of talent and a lot of laziness

BORING. None of her songs are that good. The only good ones she has to be carried by other popular artists.
Seeing Kim trying to act sexy reminds me of Ariana 😂❤️ Two cutiepies

Nicki minajs facial expressions make other female rappers look like sun burnt fairies trying to mimic her😂love you Barbie  Nicki the Rap Queen
Kim look like a Barbie ❤

Nicki minaj  🫶💓
I love this song but man the video don't suit the song AT ALL 🤣🤣
Nicki is the queen 👑 she's the all time theme of every song she's featured on ❤
Come over 👏🏾💗🫦💗🫶🏽
Thank God this’s not Unholy
Ok next guest should be Cardi B plzzzzzz
Kim Petras’s acting is so cringe. The femininity is so forced. It’s so natural on Nicki and the other women.
Could artist put some originals songs always used some olds beats 🙄
Nick da goat Queen of rap 🎉
Ate
Wasn’t this beat from kid ink song ride with me
Gosh the way Nicki ate Kim is gross, but a queen is a queen...
Where my barbz at?❤❤❤❤
Did i peep roman comin out!?!?!
as a millennial, that beat is triggering
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I only clicked on this cause Nikki was on it.
slayed !!!!!love love
This is meant to be 100% a compliment, and if anything, let’s hope it sparks a collaboration … I feel like @Kim Petras and @Naomi Jon give relatable vibes… if they teamed up for a song, it would be an unbelievable mindgasm!!!!
Youtube  With The Bullshit Again Freezing Views
It’s the gunshots for me❤❤😊
Bose plug was so lazy and unnatural like come on , marketing team - you are at the bottom this week
Adorei a referência das paquitas da Xuxa
1:47 su atuendo de ella me hizo recordar a Michael Jackson.
To everyone who believes that they somehow know the instrumental from somewhere else, its "Better off alone" by Alice Deejay. Thank me later.
Love this song! 2010’s vibe
Entregaram tudo, as referências mdssss que perfeição
Entregaram tudo
Man this was supposed to be awesome but how the beat just drops dead in the song kills it. Gotta keep the BPM up.
so glad shes using her 2000's style again
I love the Destination unkwon ref. Now let's say what is the problem here. It's clumsy and the visuals clearly BEG for a more upbeat composition. Because of how much slower the audio part is, it seems disconecteed from the visuals. It's like two people trying to have a conversation in two different languages on video call, but there is a conection problem causing delay. Make a REMIX!!! You can do better! You've done better! EDIT - Also extremely male-gazy
Wonder how much Bose paid her for that promotion?
Sex Sells
Nicki is so little 😭
These new girls can’t even keep up with Nicki. She always outshines the main artist 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Not me waiting for nick to rap 🤭❤️

Nice song... just here for the fire that is Nicki  Edit: watch Nicks verse 10 times😢... I'm so emotional
Queens
Amoo😻😻😻
Yoooo !!!!!!!! They copied the verse tune from “akon - beautiful “. Infact , they both didn’t come close to the legend.
USA Hollywood is shit Trash
NICKI is so Ugly African with Blond Hairs 🤣 haha mega joke
I would like to see Kim sing or rap in her native language
Não acredito que essa música flopou tinha tudo pra ser um grande hit
red looks so good
2 million lets gooo
love it
Does anyone get the references ?
I only like this song for nickis verse
I only clicked on this video because I saw it featured Nicki. I knew nothing about Petras until I did a Wikipedia search and I must say... HER BACKGROUND IS SO FASCINATING. She considered the youngest person in the world to undergo gender transition surgery and is a big advocate of trans rights. I also read that she had great parents too, so not only did they support her transition but also her burgeoning music career too.  You go Kim!!
Wir haben kur noch wine nase koooooks
OMG JUST LOVING OUR QUEEN
Queens perfect !!! I love you song
Ok, I love you girls but I hate that you use 'Better of Alone' in the background and reference the explicit version of 'Destination Calabria'. They are classics and I don't like to see remixes in common videos to compare: "Anaconda", until that video it's more original than this :/
https://youtu.be/CclT1VY883Q
The beat is so nostalgic 😉✨
This song is such a grower. I’m so addicted to it. You betta work Kim! Can’t wait for the whole album!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

I keep rewinding to Niki's part❤❤❤❤
It’s the TINASHE cameo for me ♥️
I can’t lie. In regards to her music, Nicki doesn’t stop, and girl is constantly dropping bangers. It’s impressive   Also impressive, is Kim’s ability to not only break into the mainstream so suddenly AND her ability to keep that mainstream attention, because of her talent!
Как-будто русскую музыку стырили🤣🤣🤣
nicki never fails to impress❤
Love the red on NM!❤

is that all?
Dope

It's barbie and it's kim petres
Nicki we couldn’t expect better that this. 👌👏👏
Please make more duets. Please. 🤩
Terrible
Rise rise rise my queen you deserve it ❤️💕
I think using so many scenes from classic videoclips is the redeemable trait for yet another remake of an old song, one which I was not very fond of and this remake being slower doesn't help either. But remebering and trying to figure out the used videoclips is fun and a nice touch.
Kim comes off extremely awkward in this video poses/Coreo. Good song she needs more work on physical presence. Nicki ate of course.
Omg this is the cutest song i’ve listen to this year. The video is lovely❤
Addison is better than these 2 nobodies.
Clubs gonna be on fire this summer 🔥
Bose ad?
Boy i tell ya, riding the babies wave..
They killed it 💯💯💯💯 ! And Tinashe 👌
Copia
Nikki is great and amazing, but people this is what's up:  KIM PETRAS has more talent in one of her assuredly goddess like pubic hairs than almost anyone who is anyone. Nikki knows her shit that's why she knew to jump on this shit while she can.  Approximately two days after Kim dropped I DONT WANT IT AT ALL (lol @ the person who referred to the bunqueen as "the new girl" is a binch and its embarrassing lol!!) I proclaimed Kim Petras would be the "New Lady Gaga" as Gaga was once deemed the "New Madonna" and had like 100,000 followers. A few short as fuck years later and she literally has been given the sickest nickname by NIKKI MINAJ. After this epically long awaited work of art Kim has been working on while laughing and being the cutest realist derpaderp   I can't even!! I am so proud of you Kim. I'm crying because you are about to embark on being the biggest, well known and beloved pop star of this generation and the best part of it is im always right.  I dont know how I've already seen you live 5 times but I will pay whatever price you gouge us when your filling mega domes YOU EARNED THIS!!   Love, just another bunhead @KimPetras
Nicky minaj🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

I love when Nicki brings Barbie out !!!! This song is 🔥 definitely radio vibes
So, I assumed I wouldn't like this song (out of pure haterism).  I love it though.  I watched the video twice in a row.
we need the remix, girl
Every life is precious so in any situation the gospel is needed: God so loved the world, That He have His only son, so that whosoever believes in Him would be saved. (John 3:16, Bible). We have all broken God’s moral law and have gotten the death penalty. However, Jesus lived a perfect life in order to take our place and endure the wrath of God. He did this because He loves us so much! Repent from sin and trust in what Jesus did for you so your sins can be forgiven and forgotten. <3
We can make This song at #1 on Billboard if we all buy the song and keep streaming…!!!!!!! This song and the video is fire its a hit guys 🔥❤
Creepy dude
Cultural reset
Nicki's black dress😍🤣
See Roman outtttt @ 2:53 🤣😂
OMG i love this song so much. the MV's concept like 90s futuristic MV (which are very rare nowaday) . the back white wall, the skintight plastic bodysuit are all ATE.
kim petras is becoming a complete artist
😍😍
Nicki killed that verse. Beautiful song by 2 queens 👑
IT'S BARBIE AND KIM PETRAS

don't fail but i'll never get to the top with another sample
Creí que estaría mejor
Omg I love the song and the music video like it so good yessss queen
I dont get how people like cardi b are more popular id rather have nicki any day
The video is giving elements of Alex Gaudino - Destination Calabria, Mason Vs Princess Superstar - Perfect and the Blink182 Nurse. There's other elements of other videos but can't think which. The song is very catchy though ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nicki still got bars sheesh
This works in very way I hoped it would. Enjoying the sampling of “Better Off Alone”.
this video gives 2000's vibes
So joyful ✨✨
I thought it's better of alone at first lmao
Kim petras e Nick uauuuuu
ok
BOP ❤
I thought the fact women of the 2020's have more control of their careers than ever, meant that videos like this, so obviously pandering to us men sexually, wouod never be made. Shows you its women, still using sexual tropes like licking the side of an obviously phallic saxaphone, that are doing this still on purpose. Clickbait and likes are yearned for and sexuality coldly used still to further their careers. Point is, it always has been, and always will, and its 99% the choice of the woman. So who's been expoited over the years? We men cant help ourselves thinking with our d***s, and women know it and use it. Fair play to them, Hope its always this way! 🤞🤞🤣🤣🤣
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
omg another verse for nicki
As maiores
❤❤🔥🔥🔥🌹🌹🌹🌹🍾🍾🍾🍾
Oww very nice ❤❤❤🎉🎉
a nicki sedenta cantando o refrão junto <3 amo elas
Samples a song from the 90s and then has blatant Bose headphones ads 😅
❤❤❤
This deserves Grammy 🔥🔥🔥
They both look fire
Reminds me of 2000s when bops were created effortlessly
this did not give the sexy i think kim expected…. but wasn’t she a youtuber?
I love ur music
Fav Song
I saw a TikTok edit of nicki recreating Michael Jackson’s  dangerous outfit so am here for it 🎉🎉 ❤🖤❤️
Feature or not Nicki never fails with the bars. This is why she’s forever the queen of rap. Nobody can fuck with her💯🐐🎯🔥
Barbzzzz
Im in love with this ❤
Every iconic song have cheap remake. This is cheap remake.
You stole the music from Tungevaag- ride with me ft. Kid ink😂😂
why do i feel like the chorus sound's like black pinks song HAHAHAHA
Play Hard - David Guetta...lol
Woah Woah! This is SURREAL! 😲❤️✨
Remake 😬❤️
this was trash I'm sorry especially lyrically speaking
it feels like I'm back in 2012, and I am living for it
wow i how i missed songs like this very 201+ vibezzz
The worst song I've ever heard
I love to hear one of the songs I loved when I was a teenager was sampled in this “Better Off Alone” by Alice Deejay. ❤
Love the song. But the beginning part when she’s in the band uniform is a copy of Destination Calabria for sure 💯
Nicki that GURL!!!!!!!!!!! ❤
uffffffff no me esperaba esto de better alone diosa minaj muy tipo 2012-13 🤩
Omg this song 😭😭😭😭omg nicki 🔥🔥🔥🔥
pornhub lyrics
After all these years the queen of rap , still gat it!!!Kim is so amazing too😍

This is really cute❤
Nicki Wow, tongue out
this song flopped so damn hard 😭
im here, im here, im late but here let the video begin
🤔 hard to tell
The song is 🔥🔥😍
❤❤❤❤❤
wow tacky cheap and all about product placement. Whats happened to art and music .
Defecating on a classic beat, with plenty of Bose product placement
woo ahhhh!
Club banger
trash xD
This felt like old school Nicki ,and I am liiiiiiving for it :)))) Faaabulous :D
Brasileiros?!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-L59kNAjeEsub_confirmation=1
The cadence and versatility nicki has is impeccable, she's goated . Kim is servinggg.  #queenstobeijing
Nickiiiiiii we love you mama
The only Queen 👑 #nickiminaj
Red Ponytail hits different ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Rainha do rap sempre fazendo história
This is rubbish.
what the hell is this shit ? ....ALICE DEEJAY 4EVER !!!
This is the collab i was looking for. Go kim and Nicki❤ leave Ice spice alone🤣🤣 im sorry princess D wasnt it..IMO..
This reminds me of starships and super bass Nicki💥💥💥
😘
I love Nicki
Yasssss ♥️💯
HAHA...my drums into pop ooh a magic carpet!!! No waaaay...lmao🤣 please
this is so good i love you both ❤️❤️❤️
guys, incase you couldnt tell, bose is the sponsor.
yayyy
This ain’t it.
okay song.. feels like its missing the drop.
Yaaaasss❤🎉
Barbie and Kim Petras ❤️❤️
Which song did they sample with the beat? it's a bop.
Nicki 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Y’all don’t understand how lyrically and visually this song together - it is masterpiece! I can definitely see why Kim said, she created/wrote this song with Nicki as an inspiration
❤❤❤❤❤😊
2010s vibe
I love you Nickiiiiiiii🥰❤️❤️
Whoever come up these concept needs to get fired! The song is perfect already. Learn from Kpop mv's, they really think about the concept not just releasing a song, both mv and song works out.
These days Nicki ignites the communication sites
That was hot 🥵
I  need to be tested for STD's after watching this.
This is a MASTERPIECE 😍❤️
I don't like it
•QUE VIDEOCLIPE IMPECÁVEL,amei tudo,essa música ficou incrível com a kim + a nicki,arrasaram muito.❤️✨
Nicki queen of rap
Hollywood atp should bring up new concepts coz its just boring seeing girls twerking with big butts and whole ass dancing, the songs are good ngl but visually its nothing Kpop on the other hand is giving us such high class content so we wish to see these stars slaying as well.
Who's  this
the best video of kim petras 🖤
Talent IS dead
nicki loveee❤
this video is a bit sexually explicit but at the same time cute
👍🏻👍🏻
❤❤
Slay
My queen nicki   ❤❤
Kim did that and nicki really did that she really the queen
Nicki helping these new gen girls over all these years, such a legend!!!
Forever nicki ❤❤❤
If you love nick let me see your like.
Yaaaaaaaas ❤❤❤❤
I hear I wanna love you by Akon and Snoop Dogg, is it just me ?
Awesome Kim P is getting to shine and it’s so nice seeing Nicki back in the Pop❤
I just love this song I really hope it hits radio
❤❤❤❤
Excelente canción UFFFF NICKI MINAJ QUEEN
When the boys hit the gym
The ball scene reminds me of Nicki Minaj in the music video with Cassie the boys it’s like she really paid homage like I don’t know if any one caught that 💕💕💕😜😜😜😜
Why does Kim have a weird face?
Nicki always fire!! 🔥🔥
👽
0:27 🚪
this is such a great song
she stole that beat from someone else. who is it?
Did Minaj write the entire song?

Dioskim y reinaj 👑
❤
Las amoooooooooooo
Las mejores ❤
Que buena fupla de reinas
Me encantaaaa
Amoooooo
Keep streaming barbs...❤
Love the video but I just would have left out the shot where she licks the oboe. I mean why? That's just weird, and not sexy. Not sure what they were trying to achieve when the rest of it was suggestive enough without being completely overt. It kinda ruined the playfulness of it which had the perfect vibe apart from that bit.
KIM ILY!!!!!!!!!!!
KIM ILY
Omg nicki minaj ❤
🤣🤣💩💩
Is that one girl tinashe?? 😂❤ correct me if I’m wrong but Nicki her thangggg and go Kim! 🎉
Spanish❤ https://youtu.be/IsBLuUHpRyE

I must say this is the best MV of Kim Petras so far.
❤😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤nicki i love you ❤
Rip the charts
This song goes hard asf
WHY TF NICKI AIN'T TURN AROUND?????? FUCK
😍😍😍
Nicki gave stands & looks & old vibes new vibes she so animated @ 2:14 @1:55 🦄🦄👸🏽 & the face & hand movement @ 1:58 the stands when she said “I’m Not the one doing the imitating” @ 1:59 gave me life tf down  & 2:12 2:25
fuckin hate kim petras music but she mothers so i’ve got to contribute my views 🫡
luv u kim pretty 💋
NICKIII ATE DOWNNN
i never really liked kim petras but this song hit the sweet spot and i love the beat
Masterpiece❤️
I mean like Nicki will always be queen
Yah yeahh
Ate so bad!
A Millie in a day!!!!! It’s Barbie and it’s Kim Petras
I like this. Nicki so talented.
Cheapness of the first category. You can only sing through sex and advertising. And people like it? This? Sorry. Corrupted world.
Este beat me recuerda a play hard de david guetta
❤❤❤
/
Pop Perfection
Nicki is a gem❤
aaaaaa amooo
Better off alone by Alice DJ is so good but this ruined that beat which I thought was impossible. The chorus is kinda cute but those verses were trash. Nicki had to remind us twice who was on the songs because it's so forgettable. Then Nicki has been delivering the same thing for years like it's a cold pizza you didn't order and don't want. Her verses literally are always the same and as usual as a feature has nothing to do with the rest of the song. Nicki has been really hopping on popular artists or beefing with them and hopping on popular songs lately and it's starting to feel like it's to stay relevant.  Kim petras had a peak with unholy and this sample is a popular track. Freaky girl is a popular track, super freak. Ice spice. Doja cats already popular say so. None of these artists needed nickis feature at all. I thought her first two albums were so good and after that it's been the same thing. Her fans are bananas talking about she's the best rapper. Like she raps about the same thing so she should be able to be good at that but even then others do it better.
IS 2:40 A BLINK 182 REFERENCE?? I NEED TO KNOW OMFG
Wow!!! The beat is Out of this World!!!! 👽👽👽👽👽👽🛸🛸🛸🛸🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊
Amazing
Click on b word before she finish her sentence
Sucks can’t listen to Kim P anymore, fk Minaji
It flopped
Kim Petras is unstoppable <3
Original Music is far better Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgs9QUtWc3M
Esse toque do DAVID GUETTA nos leva a 2010-2015 SO GOOD NICKIIIIII
Love it
Umm that opening is totally from an old school trance song
watching the music video at 1.25 speed greatly improves the music experience <3
Nicki minaj makes her fans sooooo hapy shes truly herself and constanly gives th best SONGS bitch im living my best life❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Wait isn't that the same beat of " play hard"?????
Main character syndrome they extras lmaoooo Kim bye

They revive this sample every couple of years. The OG sample is from Alice Deejay “better off alone”.
I thought I saw Bretman at 1:52
This is legit dumster trash.
Nicki Minaj the woman that you are

Kim is really a masterpiece but nicki really chewed on her verse omg

Ahhhhh Nicki worked with a trans woman !!!! I’m screaming and want to cry so bad omg!!!! Congratulations KIMPETRAASSSSSSSS
This reminds me of the 2014 era of music. There's just something about the way the song sounds and the way the music video kind of looks like the music video from "Super Bass" by Nicki.
1:48 1:48 1:48
Main character syndrome!!! They extruhhhhhssss
“Boe Say”

This song is a whole vibe. I can hear this at every theme park this entire summer.  This is a hit for sure
I'm so excited they made a music video because I've had this song on repeat ever since it came out!! Such an iconic collaboration and the instrumental gives me such a nostalgic feeling! 💖
Nicki part really saved the song !! Kim part could’ve been better
❤❤❤
Kim and Nicki look soooooo good
Here for Nicki only! ✌️😎
Leave “Better Off Alone” alone dammit! 😂
They could have used someone who doesn’t look like R Kelly… not gonna lie was this done on purpose or am I the only one who noticed?
This was cool. I dig it.
Amei ❤

Nickiii so cool❤

DARWIN DARWIN NUÑEZ
Is that Tinashe by 2:06?
I think “Better Off Alone” goes way harder…….. Nicki’s part was rad though.
Now this is a certified 2023 music video quality
This is my introduction to Kim. What a lovely video. Clean, great choreo, vocals and a dance mix throwback sound.. the Queen killed it as usual and I'm now a Kim Petras fan. Great job girls ❤
What is this choreography? Sorry sis that’s not it.

1:00 to 1:05 off sync. Her lips aren't in line with the song.
Make the product placement casual. Lol.
Queen ❤❤
O comentário brasileiro que estava procurando 😂
🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🍭
I still love you Nicki
Amei
I love the old classic beat but the heavily sexualized lyrics and vid ruin it like most songs today
Them crammin' just about every kind of kink into a video for a raunchy pop song has a bit of a bitter 50 Shades of Gray aftertaste. I get the feeling they have been playing this shtick for a while now rather more to boost their view rate than from their hearts. For kink, one might just as well call this what it is. Careless exploitation instead of sincere representation.
All Nicki 💗
Love u Nicky  Kim petras ❤❤
work hard play hard is all I hear
❤
❤❤❤❤
Nicki Minaj is really the only female rapper that could disappear off the face of the earth for however long she wants and still have people waiting for her return and desperately wanting new music, that’s powerful for real.
IM FORGETTTING THIS IS ROMAN THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS TONE ACCENT 🔥🔥😭💕 HES BACKKK
I just love how kim is so Giddy around nicki, you can tell shes so excited 😂😂Cuteness Overload
Sounds like "Work hard, play hard Work hard, play hard We work hard, play hard Keep partyin' like it's your job, ayy"
A GROWER!!!
❤️
Is she gonna be competing for women awards or men. Real talk. Do we consider her a man still. I mean he can't win for best female can he or she idk. No disrespect it's just confusing. Can we create a lane for them specifically so they don't take from others that really deserve it
0:38 why is it giving my anaconda don’t here 😂
Please someone teach Kim how to be in a videoclip and dance
How much did Bose pay for this music video? 🤣
More like a sex advert than a song
this is the cringiest thing ive seen so far
I still can’t get over the red outfit it was a GAGGGGG
NICKI JACKSON 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
it is insane seeing kim with this budget. she deserves it so much.
I am following Kim ever since she appeared on German tv. It’s so surreal to see her becoming this big pop star and working with icons like Nicki. I feel like a proud dad 🥺 And Nicks part is so dope. She is infact the queen of rap!!!
THE DOLLS ARE WINNING
Fake
🤮
Damn 💅💅
slayed
Nicki ate ❤❤❤
La canción con un minuto más hubiera sido espectacular. 75/100
https://youtu.be/wv2TS1Sn20w Love how she set herself a mission to become a pop star and has not let anything get in her way such an inspiration and very determined person, she gives a lot of people hope and makes me want to believe in my self even more ❤
Kim is not alone like me but it's a nice song.. Queen Nicki is allways lovely 👑🐐

I’m hooked..
NO SONO NI SONARA
this song is giving early 2010s vibes
💞💞💖💖
the fact Nicki hopped on a track with a trans artist is fucking ICONIC!! both of these woman are just incredible.
Ripping off an old song, Check! Oversexualizing lyrics for no reason, Check! Including a rap verse in the middle of the song like it's 2003, Check! Trying too hard to make people believe that those individuals have any artistic merit, Check!
I didn’t know she sings too! I actually like this song a lot!
😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😊😊
Same beat as so many other songs. Next.
Nicki 👑 💗
Work hard David guetta

Both Kim and Nicki ALWAYS SLAYYYY!!!! As a clarinet player, how cool would it be to have a clarinet that Kim used in a music video?!?! 😱😵😭💓 I’d probably pass out! 🥴🤣💓😁 This whole video concept is everything! I always love when an older song makes its way back into the spotlight with a new take! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Letsgo the music video droppedd
This is the song my dad used to play, it seemed like it always came on the radio when he’d drive the family to dinner in our old station wagon. I'm 54 now and he passed away a few weeks ago, I will never forget this song and it will always have a special place in my heart
1999 👉 2023😜

Why does it have to be this sexual.
Young whipper snappers should also look up Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone from 1999 to appreciate where the backing track came from.
SOOOO GOOD
I don't know why... I want to buy a Bose headset now.
Had to watch it twice, so good
A chaque fois j’attends juste la partie de Nicki
Not heard this beat before how new and different (sarcastic)
Come on now it's so good blow up ❤️❤️🔥🔥
Poor Nicki had no shot at saving this 🗑
Now this is my type of music love y’all
I saw God today. Thank you Kim. Truly. My life is full filled. I am truly happy. My Purpose  here is done. I have transcended.
Alice Deejay shocked😎

LESGOOOOOOOOOOO
Personally, I really dislike the lyrics and Kim Petras her voice. Her movements and dancing is cringe to me. Only watching this to hear Nickis verse.
My lady Nicki….. much love from Nigeria
DISGUSTING!!!
LOVE and HAVE LOVED Kim ever since she first released "One Piece of Tape" many many years ago. Its exhilerating to see her starting to recieve the recognition she truly deserves.   The only thing I am disappointed with is the visuals of the music video.  Yes, every outfit Kim is wearing is very fashionable and looks AMAZING on her, and her personal esthetic alone is gorgeous, but I would have liked to see more visuals or more of a story behind the song type of thing as far as the video goes.    Nonetheless, Love you Kim <3
Por que esto no está tendido el reconocimiento que merece vamos chicos
This is very beautiful. Follower and beautiful 😂😂from Morocco 🇲🇦 I love you all

The music video is lit but the song ain't it. Such a waste for a stunning MV.
This woman Nicki Minaj is a goddess ...
The queen always support new girl pop 🎉 respect ❤
I’m sorry are my eyes deceiving me or is that Tinashe?
Were people hoping that "BEAT" would continue or a rip off of alone from 1999? I'm seeing some people talking about this, about generation z, guys, relax, i'm a millennial too, just enjoy this version, no drama, just start the music. Good job girls
https://youtu.be/TP9DbloPe2k
This song is giving me those summer hit vibes. Defo going to be a big song x
Kim looks bored. something is off

Yesss Nicki
When is it enough…? Such filth and disgust. Seems like people can’t get enough. So evil and demonic. No wonder the world is in such way.
Finally!!! A label who knows MF Kim deserves to be heard and seen !
Esse albúm vai ser lendário, gostosas!
Eu amei ! ❤❤❤❤

The way this song is so bad the only nice part about it is Nicki's part (block me  if you feel offended or wanna fight me)
Lyrics genius and Choreo is mind blowing. You can never get enough crotch thrusting.
Barbie 🦄 .
One thing about a Nicki Minaj feature is that its gon be the secret sauce for a banger!!! No signature like hers!
Nicki has remained a force in the music industry  The fact that she is so versatile not only in her music, but who she collaborates with is so inspiring. Two icons in the music industry. Pop off  indeed!
It's so f@@king amazing! Я ебу, ахуеть не встать 😍😍😍😎

I'm glad Nicki is using her old style... It kinda sends me back to the 2000s She's absolutely killing it ❤️❤️❤️
To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
As a Barb, I have been fed!
Nickiiiiiiiiii! They both look gorgeous and this music video is fun!
Omg I freaking love it
🔥🔥🔥
Muito bom
I wish artist came up with their own rhythm instead of taking it from a different song and " make" it their own ... ugh 😒
QUEENS
Queen singed the self verse and gone. Reminded me of her duet with B.O.B. (“Out Of My Mind”).
Kim it's not giving
Nicki 🥰
BARBIE ALWAYS COMES TO SERVE😍

Let's be honest we only clicked on here for Nicki
She's the sidekick in her own song 😂😭😭
Chatgpt lyrics
Clipe incrível. Só queria uma explosão de pop farofa na música aaaa
I love everything about this music video and the song is just perfect!!!
My queenss
I adore it .. Congrats for the colab.. you go girl .. 🙌🏼👌🏽👍🏼🤞🏽✨🔥🎼🎧🎤
The funny part is again a beat that has been stolen its so hilarious when are people going to make their own music its so hilarious for years America has ghost writing & stolen beats & music its so funny everyone can do that ! 😂 making billions of dollars showing filters & fake beauty unlimited botox & butt implants lol good job America good job ! Hahahahahahahahaha nobody wanna taste  NM iiiuew i understand why joe biden  is laughing at any American person they are to stupid to understand the world. Instead they make Children's rich just for saying Gucci gang wow man so amazing talent 💩 really hilarious.
“I’m not the one doing the imitating” then why take lil Kim’s barbie person and queen bitch radio 15 years after her album???
It’s a shame Alice Deejay who did the original song was not featured in the video in some way as she has returned after 20 years! Such a missed opportunity there! She could of even sang the famous better of Alone Vocal to give fans a bit of nostalgia. https://youtu.be/Lgs9QUtWc3M

Such a beautiful music video. I love the song too. This feat is perfection! But i feel that kim should work on her moves and facial expressions
This song is giving both year '2010 and 2023 vibes
Nicki ate
Got a download something’s gonna happen 😳✌️
Nicki’s fit game though she’s been going off🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
I love this video song 🔥🥰🤩 💗✨💫
Another Nicki lyrics to learn before summer
This song is on repeat. Damn. ❤
I'm not hating but even though the melody is catchy, the instrumental is redundant and boring.
QUEENS
thought i was listening to black eyed peas at first then i heard her voice. good song!
Deserves more than grammy
1:48 THE QUEEN'S PART
Que orgulho da minha garota Ice, Kim you're perfect <3
You both fumbled this so bad
The😢 sample ia boring.  Her stage presence is terrible.  Nicki dont save the song (what she does in a very easy way)  She need to study much more to become a pop artist.  I understand that a commercial think here. But, the song is very very Boring. In Unholy she alrrady show her bad way to be a pop star, but that song was god and vicious. This one is terrible and her problematics with pop fenomena comes out stronger
Nicki verse is too short 😫
This is so good 💖
Barbzzzzzz
What in the world is this trash? Ive never felt so embarrassed for someone. Hahaha WOW
Kim is ready
Oh nicki oooooohhhh nicki 😍 you gon' kill me. You're just... you know what?! No words can describe your act. OMG ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just love this song kim ❤
She is so fit hot sexy gorgeous beautiful dam ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
When is the album out
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
amazing!!!!!
Oh yeah this isss a VIBE!. Wicked one 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯✌️✌️✌️
Que clipe impecáveeel
Alice deejay - better off alone  original music ,, Kim petras copycat better off alone music ???
Nicki is so beautiful, I can't...
We can see how happy Kim is to be with Nicki, so happy for her te realise her Barbz fantasy
This MV is so pretty and 2000s vibes
Queen Nicki ❤❤❤❤❤
The entire time I was trying to figure out where the sample was from and it was from that song 'you think your better off alone' but the music video is referencing those 90's euro pop videos...but love it anyways, great job and great song! Glad to see her make a come back after she decided not to release her paris album :D We need more music from her!!!!
Collab of the year!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yass queen ate
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Daddy proud
They are so beautiful
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Nicki is just too perfect!

KIM PETTY CAME TO SERVE‼️
Love love LOVE!!! Kim is so cute and the music video reminded me of aris sode to side. I love how nicki didn't take over the video. As much as i wanted to see her ALL over this, getting to know kim better because of nicki, she deserved to have some time only on her. ❤❤❤ Thank you nicki and thank you kim!!!
It’s giving Super Bass vibes 🩷🩷🩷

What is this garbage
Nicki is Queen of Rap
This is such a bop, Kim and Nicki killed it
Just gross 🐒🐒🐵🐷🐷🐷
It sounded like play hard by david guetta
The core music is like playhard😬
Slay queens
Are everyone upset with Nicki why not veiwing?
Buy, stream on ALL platforms, and request radio play! Let's move it up the charts now that there's a music video!
Can we cancel the King’s coronation and celebrate Kim Petras instead? ❤🤷‍♂️
Why do they always sample the same old songs? I mean, I don't mind samples but at least be creative with it and make it sound completely different. It sounds the same. Might as well listen to the old versions.
Here for Nicki 🎉
Just unfollowed
No inspiration girls ?
It's a song and nonsensical video about riding dick... doesn't anyone want to make and see something of substance? I don't get how you're all happy with eating from the bottom like this.
Nicki❤❤
The mother & Queen of Rap never seems to miss a beat. ❤️🔥
I LOVE HER MIX VOICE SO SO MUCH❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
We love u Kim ❤
❤
Apoyemos a Kim se lo merece nos está dando un hit
All I can hear what is love and think about Night at the Roxbury
Yasss Kim ❤
You should give credit to alice deejay
Nicki + Kim =🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Nicki plus anyone = 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤
0:41 Bose vs Beats who wins?

WOWWW
GOOO !! 1MIL BFORE 24HOURSS !!!
How much did Bose pay to get that up close shot for 3 seconds
Ripping off an old song, Check! Oversexualizing lyrics for no reason, Check! Including a rap verse in the middle of the song like it's 2003, Check! Trying too hard to make people believe that those individuals have any artistic merit, Check!
J'adore j'adore👑👑💖💖💖 La Reine Est Toujours Là💖💖👌👌👑👑👑🎤🎤👑👑🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A cultural reset YAAAAS
Kim and the dancers look so cute, the choreo is on point and Nicki is just Queening💕💫💖

I'm a big Nicki fan but she doesn't gotta be on EVERY song. By the time her album comes out I'm gonna be tired of her. Its starting already. I said what I said.
It's a shame when a good theme, beat and singer has the WORST lyrics! Gross
WHEN NICKI SEND SHOTS THEY ALWAYS BE STINGING THESE BITCHES CHILLEE THEY WILL ONLY CLICK ONCE U FINISHED UR SENTENCE
This is ICONIC SHITTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 NICKI & KIM LOOKED BOMB

Comment section nothing but bots 😂
They are taking it, it's giving visuals and looks.   Main Character Syndrome 🔥🔥🔥 #AloneVideo
Maravilhosas!!! #Brazil
Love it ladies! ❤
An even more boring video to a already boring song.. what was all the hype for lmao

WAIT WHATTTT ITS ACTUALLY SO GOOD TF. DEVOURED FR
Kim always has good songs
Mid video deffo fire arrad
Let’s hit 2 million today!
What in the F?! Part of me wants to laugh w/disgust while the other half is truly outraged by this stupid soft porn video w/two “singers” & their autotune😮
Hey when I searched for the song before bed all I can find was a 14 minute Petras stream. Something was wrong. We’ve been sabotaged!
Is it just me or is Nicki thick now 😮🤯🔥
* skips to Nicki Minaj’s part *
I goggled the definition of 'sexy' and their was a photo of Nicki Minaj 😅😂
Amazing
Nicki so GORGEOUS

Why does the music sound the same as Neyo and David Guetta's song  ''play hard'' 🗿
If I went to school with Nicki we would be gossiping FOR SUREEEEEEEEEE
Kim is Terrible   Auto tuned and probably better on ONLYFANS
This is YMCMB Nicki Minaj
Call her kim petty
Loveeeee this song 🦋🔥
produced by a rapist <3
Yaaaaaaaassss 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You should be ashame to take the beat of the chronus of an other artist and use it  like it is  without event modify it. At this point it more plagia than anythimg else.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTawo1sVQg8&ab_channel=BrunoMartiniVEVO.   This is the artist that own the beat that you use, it in the chronus at 00:38. The beat is exactly the same and the song save me fron avian grays, Bruno martini and trixie was out  3 years ago. Shame on you Nicki Minaj and Kim Petra for stealing the beat of an other song

Nicki in Michael Jackson outfit is just WOW🥹🫶🏼
SO GOOD!!😻
Is that Tinashe or am I tripping?
OMG the song and this video has the same vibes as No Broken Hearts I love it ! ❤️
Thank you Nicki.. It actually means something when someone who is already at the top of their game sees it for the lil ones that are working to solidify their name and brand. It doesnt surprise me that Nicki would work with someone who is Trans but its still an awesome sight to see
ดีทุกอย่าง 👍 🔥

This song feels oddly like a fever dream, and the music video doesn't help. It's so weird, like something between Ashley O and the Anaconda video.

Greatness !🖤
Nicki is gifted she is what you call a versatile artist ❤
Nicki is literally queen of rap change my mind
I thought they finished with this type of music and videos in 2012
Love when nicki is in her element and not in drama. The bars stay 🔥🔥🔥. Please stay here ❤

David Guetta - Play Hard 😑
🔥🔥🔥
I love the song   but let's be real this video doesn't make any sense💀. There was no need for that choreo it's just a feel good song.   I know these days we need visuals but they gotta at least make a little bit of sense.
Nicki’s line is soooo good🤩 queen materials
I really LOVE the Nicki’s outfits and looks here 😍🔥🔥🔥
I’m so happy there’s Trans representation in music, especially now more than ever.  The doors Big Freedia has opened ❤

This is literally a piece of art, the video is EVERYTHING💖💖💖💖
Beautiful
Nicki always slaysssss!!!!
Nicki is truly a legend I cant believe yall was even letting comparisons slide through at all. Kim and Nicki was not an expected combo but this is a banger
1 milli views in 24 hours we can do it! Barbz 🤝🏻 bunz
Omfg Its Barbie and its Kim petras.
IM SCREAMING!!! Nicki perfect as always and Kim, omg this girl is talented af! I freaking love her voice sm😍 love the visuals, the scenario, the catchy beat and lyrics! Another banger!!!🔥
Why is everything about sex do something different this song will flop
The secret to staying relevant is just being about your art and business, ALWAYS.
Menos mal Nicki Minaj promocionó la canción porque el liryc no llego a nada y es muy buena canción
I hate when shit artists have to rip off classics in order to create something so drivel..... cant anyone be original anymore. Alice DJ this ain't got shit on you're original. Shame the record company allowed your track to be sampled.
Barbz and bunheads unite ⚔️ let's blow this song tf up and high on the charts 📈
While others are in the met gala nicki stay blowing jams🎉
I came here for Nicki and left here with Kim ... Damn 🔥
:3
First of all: BOTH OF THEM ARE SO ICONIC AND THIS SONG SLAYS MY PUSSY.  Secondly: 3:01 is such a meme🤣🤣🤣

This is Nicki's grammy!!❤
Ugh as a Kim Petras fan I hope her identity doesn't get lost in her rise to commercial success... the visuals on this look cheap and she seems uncomfortable
it’s BARBIE & it’s KIM PETRASSSS 🩷 slay queens
Mother❤❤🎉🫶🏼
Nicki alone is iconic
I’m sorry song is good but the video isn’t all that. This new girl just looks like a cheap version of Erica jayne
😍
OBSESSED ‼️
Yes yes yes yaaaassssssss 😍😭♥️
❤❤❤
legendary tbh
The director of this miusic video sucks
iconic
The video is also *chefs kiss 💋! I love the references I feel it gives to the music vids of that era ✨  Destination Calabria, call on me, doctor love. And then with these goddesses, my queens, it’s just amazing 💕

Flop era for both 😅

I’m fed 😋
YesSssSs
Nicki minaj es beautiful
I’ve been a Kim Petras fan for the past couple years now, and I’m just so excited to see her taking off! It makes me happy to see that even now that she’s making it big, she’s still just so adorable.
Las amooooooo... 💜✨
MOTHERS 🩷
I send shots get ready they may sting 😭😅I love her❤
She really didn't change the beat in 39 seconds of the video😢
Who ever argues with nicki being the queen got problems who's plowing through rappers singers ticktockers her on albums written by her💝
🍑🔥🍑🔥🍑
Congratulations your song it's make me happy🔥👑😍😘the queen Nicki Minaj and Kim petras❤️
Is that Tinashe l saw
We'll pretend Kim is a woman , Lol
I dont know why, but this video does not fit the song so much….it seems cheap and just….random
Literally in tears Nicki is the Goat 😢🥹
I'm convinced Nicki Minaj unlocked Cheat Code for Time & Space itself! For the past year she's throwed me bck in 2012 (Highschool) with all these features and BANGERZ 😂 everywhere. So I'm def going on this ride again 💪💙
Nicki ❤️❤️
❤
Actually one of the better Alice Deejay samples used on a song. Not bad at all.
I LOVE YOU NICKI🩷
Kim Petras kinda sucks
A bop❤
Lit
They should never do a video with ARRAD again, the video is cute but is just weak
The fact that Kim is taller than Nicki blows my mind
who else can hear AKON
Knew it’d be slutty but not this slutty. I love this
Dude , this music is wonderful, this video clip is wonderful , Kim and Nicki are wonderful !! E everything is beautiful!! This is the best thing i seen this year ❤️😍💅✨👑👑  Mi love It!! ❤️😍✨👑

Nicki red ponytail is fire 🔥😮‍💨 & of course Nicki killed it 🔥
Y’all ain’t catch when Nicki said. “All this cake he doing the tasting, I send shots get ready they may sting” **she said “I send” in a way that it also sounded like she said “icing” which correlates with the cake line… 👏🏽
kim had so much fun with mother i can seee ittttt 🥰🥰

Is it just me or can everyone hear "Play Hard" by D Guetta, Ne-Yo & Akon, playing the entire time 🤣
They are so cute and perfect together!!! Nicki is the mother fucking QUEEEN, and Kim - girl, I'm so proud of you!!! Been following you for years and always thought you were so insanely talented, so glad you're getting your flowers now girl!!!!! My fav. part of the video hands down was 2:07 - like OMFG idk if someone told Kim to do that or if it just came natural, but it was PERFECT with Nicki's facial expression omgggg!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The rap game is going to SUCK after Nicki retires 😭
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Budget!!!
I bet these head phones don’t fall out like other brands.  I want bose

Radio and play listing needs to pick this up ASAP
This is a gag
If trans women keep looking like this it’s over. Over for cis women.
Very good!
Omg!
That was not a cohesive video.  All over the place. Didn't match the lyrics.  Girls looked good but directing was terrible
She’s out of here. I’ve been listening to her for 5 years.
#queenofrap
My jaw dropped when I saw nicki in Red ❤

I don’t care what anyone says  I think this is the best feature Nicki has done in 2023 and it’s better than Princess Diana with ice whatever her name is haha 😂
Its a banga for me 🔥❤
Yo this  is 🔥 I wanna hear this everywhere I go I wish they added an extra beat to it make it a club bop! But I'm in 💕 either way I know other versions may come!

As a long time Barbz and a trans, my heart is so full. I love it and im proud of Kim & Nicki 🔥
Love that nicki is keeping her knee on these wanna-be rappers necks non-stop.  Song fire 🔥.  Bars for years. Mother never disappoints. Am I the only want that wanted nicki to show the back area of that black suit lol.
THIS ATE
It’s Barbie and it’s Kim Petras😌❤️
I felt the roman’s revenge season when i saw the part of nicki this was nostalgic
That song was cool I like it ❤🎉😊
No one talk of how Nicki looks like Meghan with the red outfit
I guess Bose has asked from Nicki who she is going to collaborate with 🤭
My goodness I love this
The video is superior
Omg this is such a cute ass vibe! Nicki doing it once again 🎉❤🎉❤
It’s missing an iconic bridge or sumn
Likes a billion ❤

🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
Que hinooooooo
SO SO SO GOOD THE BEAT SUPER catch my ear god !FIRE FIRE!
Alone is currently #67 on lTUNES let’s get it #1 Yall 🏆🔥!
What was kim doing with her moves when Nicki's part started ? I'm not sure if it's her not knowing what to do, not being camera ready or if it was intentional? Some moves were cringy and not executed properly, makes it look unprofessional... confuseeeeed! ANYONE?!!!
MOTHERSSSSSS!!!!!
Two of my favorite Queens together, as always, pure excellence.
❤❤
Woah this is different from the leaked, I was gonna say I didn’t like the leaked version cuz it sounded corny but this is just so much more greater production value. Good job, good summer bop. :)
Ahhh these both>>> Barbie and Kim Petty
~✨♥️😘💋❤️✨~
Perfeitas!❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Que artistas , que cantoras , que clipe, essa música é tão boa. E como sempre a Minaj mostrando porque é a Rainha do Rap e a Kim uma grande revelação da música pop e juntas entregaram esse hino chamado : ALONE 🎠💅
So weird I didn’t like song at all because the chorus was sooo annoying but the video allowed me to not focus on the beat and voice over production and appreciate the overall sound
I love how Nicki ride that beat tho‼️‼️👑👑👑🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not Roman making an appearance in the video 😂
Me encanta te amo mi kim❤❤😍😍
As Queens🥰🏳️‍🌈🇧🇷

Also, didn't Nicki retire? Bank account must be drying up, huh.
It's Barbie and Kim Petras
Wiz Khalifa say yeah sample
I set trends from Queens to Beijing 🤭🦄
Now go and listen to Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone. I love Kim Petras's music but I hate that none of these artists ever givecredit to the original in their descriptions.

One of the best music videos of this year
What a courage that they had an excellent sample and it was a disappointment, a YouTube remix sounds better, we wanted music and sound to dance something summer and this is not it, RELEASE A NEW VERSION!
2:06 is that Tinashe ?
lets go barbz stream and buy alone
Escuchándola varias veces ya no suena tan mal 🎉❤
OMGGGG YESSS NICKIII
Eu simplesmente amei
They slay❤
Wouldnt they get copyrighted or sued for the first melody??? 🤨  (Play hard- David Guetta)
This is iconic, one for the books
Video stink but awesome record, either way don’t y’all think it’s time everyone face it. NICKI MINAJ is RAP/HIPHOP
Icónics 🩷🩷🩷🩷
I set trends from Queens to Bejing, Im NOT the one who do the imitating 👑

🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
NICKI ate this verse 🥵
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I love it.... Kim and Anaconda❤
Nicki ruined it 🫤  Which there was a version without her verse.
oh my... 🤩
I can’t believe she was born with a penis🤔😳😳😳🤯🤯🤯🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
It’s a hard no for me love Nicki but y’all gotta start being real
This song still sucks 😅. The music video is barely doing anything. The only reason why this song is still relevant is due to TikTok using the chorus as a sound
This is so cuteeeeeeeee ❤❤❤❤❤
I didn't expect this type of VISUALS this song deserves more 🥹 we should push it high
Achei meia boca !
NOW I'M LIVING!!!!😩😩🔥🔥💋💋
❤❤❤
This was good, Queen love you.
Again NICKI QUEEN OF RAP
❤❤❤
WHAT
I LOVEEE IT
Who did the lighting this video is so dark turn up the saturation barbie world
I love Kim Petras and Nicki Minaj, but I find the art direction here super disturbing. It's predatory with the guy just sitting in the chair watching all the women. Stuff like this has been done a million times where women are nothing but objects. Wow, she's a nurse. Wow, she's licking a clarinet. Then a dominatrix. I mean, did they run out of ideas? Can we get something original, please? Kim Petras is gorgeous and has a strong voice, but her record company isn't utilizing her potential. This was just so underwhelming.
Woooooŵww kim ❤❤❤❤❤❤ i love u
damn this lit and it's not even my kind of music nicki bodieddddd that beat perfect
Yesss I love this ❤
Every single moment was a different homage to classic 90's EDM songs and I'm in LOVE!! I said ' bitch even "Superstar"??' first introduction to music and I'm not mad about <3 Favorite references were from Mason vs Princess Superstar - Perfect (Exceeder) <3 <3 <3 ANd Yes Kim you ARE Perfect 10/10 <3
The Karl L reference NICKIII OMG ICONIC 🥹💓💓
Pop sampling is getting absolutely stupid now
Love that Nicki made it in person to Kim Petras’ music video and not Katy Perry hahah
Amazing ladies 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I love this so much omgggggggg❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nicki is out here working! This is going to be a great year for her!
Queen of rap

Wow i love Niki, she  just unlocked yet another level ..this woman is timeless ..shes here she is here ❤
This song is f&%king epic!!! I love it! Obsessed! Fan of the original song too. Thank you queens for this colab! The MV was 🔥❤
Kim Petty & Nicki Minaj
Omg, it's perfect
Woooo-Ahhhhhh! 🎉
Fly Kim petras 🗣️
This fucking hits, holy shit 💯💯💯
Just keep going, Kim Petras !! 🎉
I loved ❤❤❤❤
Im trying to say nothing but I watch the video again and I cant. Kim; why? This is not Slut Pop this is not that kind of song pls think about it this song sounds like something can go even far away your career. Really? Simulate to estimulate the clarinet as a p3nis? Its tasteless it makes us the trans woman being seeing as a fetish Im personally dont like it who is your manager? Wtf Youre the first trans pop superstar think about it. For the pictures on IG i think it would be a cheerleader guiding her crush to the football camp it would better and you could take advantage of the nostalgia because many people listen the original song when they were on High School. I support; we need visibility; but please think about it the things I said are NOT for a bad reason
Yasssssssss I’ve been waiting for this love this
wtf has the world come to???
Omg love it
Music was cool,nicki's bars were basic boy they really do a lot to make your voice sound good, sounded like Webster hall music. That club house.give it a 7,OH DON'T  GET THE PETTY TAT THAT'S HER RAPIST HUSBAND'S LAST NAME but you probably don't care,anyway. 🥴😬😂
NICKIIIII!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
Deluxe Kim & Nicki
l love you
This video giving me bebe rexha ft nicki minaj - no broken hearts vibes 😂
Amazing job Kim & Nicki‼️‼️ I love your energies together! Just epic🫶🏾🤩

Iconic
I am a 23 year old man from South Sudan, I have spent most of my life in a continuous war, it was a normal day 2 weeks ago as I was fighting. Then, the Sudanese fighters played this absolute masterpiece, we then began to all put down our guns and dance to this lyrical masterpiece. Thank you, sir. For Peace this song changed my life. My entire view of everything that exists in this world, in fact, even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way again. This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song. This video is an exquisite masterpiece, out of every single video I have ever even heard of on the entire platform, this by far has enlightened me to do fly, lose 90 pounds and even become the president of the United States, and I'm going to tell you why this is such a masterpiece as if hearing the creators, no, god of this universes luscious voice. I would like to express my thanks to you. My gratitude for your indisputably magnificent assistance is almost infinite. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. I really like your contribution that you have in our society, you really make a difference and help others out, the world could always use more people like you. Gosh, what a polite and humble fellow. It is such a kind honor  for someone as low as me to be in contact with someone of a level such as yours. I thank you once again my good friend. A world without you, would be a world I would not be able to live in, and I believe I share that opinion with most people. I can rest easy tonight knowing you helped. I appreciate you and everything you stand for and on behalf of everyone on planet earth, thanks. Yes I 100% agree no lie I am 10/10 with you in this statement no question. You are completely absolutely correct and have made no mistake in your sentence whatsoever and I applaud you for that as you have made a thoughtful statement that many agree with and those that disagree are in the minority because your statement has absolutely no faults and thus is completely without a question correct and deserves nothing but agreement. and by the way, super saiyan blue theme is a very powerful, moving song that showcased the capabilities of human emotion. It used groundbreaking technology to create stunning sounds that would mesmerize the listeners. This song is suitable for all ages; whether you're 5 years old, or 50, you should listen to this song. It is inspiring and it showcases the spectrum of human nature and how humans communicate with each other. This song revolutionized the music industry and set the bar high for other songs. In the future historians will look back on this song and regard it as the pinnacle of human achievement. It was a roller-coaster from start to finish, the nail-biting song will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Listeners will find themselves absorbed by the heartwarming tale of a relentless, determined African tribes who didn't let societies standards shape his/her/it's life. I was shocked by how intense and gripping this song was. The plot is rich, unpredictable and touching. This isn't your typical African war song, this song is a war with one's emotions. Tales of Africa is a stirring masterpiece that only comes once in a millennium. This thrilling instruments makes it a jaw-dropping performance that properly utilizes the medium. I rate this song 10 African tribes/10 African tribes, and will never listen to it again as every time I get saddened by the the fact that there will never be a song to match this masterpiece.
MARAVILHOSAS! 💖💖💖

Kim Petras owning the 🌍
Amooo
I will support Kim Petras for her achievements in the industry but I just can't ignore the fact that she seems a bit clumsy and awkward when dancing. I don't know why, she seems half a step behind all the time in the video or you can catch her looking around for a split second waiting for her turn to make a pose or a move
❤️😍❤️😍
Lindas amei demais 😍😍❤️
Nicki Minaj has to get new people to collab with because her cutting music by herself don't cut it. 🤣🤣🤣
Do you think you’re better off alone?
Nicki delivered. That red look was 🔥 🔥
MARAJ DYNASTY
☀️ Summer Bop all 2023🎉
KIM PETTY
So this is what PERFECTION looks like. The Queen always on fire 🔥

✨💖🦄
Kim Petras a paquita perdida 😎🥰❤.
Song: Iconic  Video: Iconic
Ela se inspirou em Destination Calabria, Call on Me e The Killer Song…  mas a música não casa com o vídeo.  Triste… Minaj belíssima… ponto alto
🔥🔥😍❤
Did I spot Tinashe at 2:04?? 🔥
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The video should’ve been in a clubbb!!
YASSSS QUEENS SLAY❤
Nicki was like nope! I drop my videos whenever i want! Love her!!!

Wait!! is that roman zolanski? 🙄🎀🦄
one thing about nicki .... she never disappoints 🥰😻🔥🔥🔥🔥
all i know is the brand bose is make money
Record is trash and so is the choreo in this video.. What a waste of a Nicki feature.. I expected more from Kim.. lLooks like they’re watering her down for the masses.. sad..
Soak Nicki in NOW because there will NEVER be another Nicki, icoNIC ✨
Queens 😍😍
Kim and Nicki looked so good! Alone is a bop.
I liveeeeeee❤❤
The Queen ate 🔥
i think this song is really good sonically & nostalgically. raidio stations near me play the same 8-12 songs over and over and add in a random song to the mix here and there, anyway i hope this song gets added to that rotation
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽😍😍😍😍
Mfkn ate 🤝🏾💥🔥
Biggest bullshit...
Waw 🔥
UGH THIS IS SO GOOD THEY LOOK AMAZING🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anything QUEEN 👸 Nicki touch turns GOLD 🙏1🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🧯🧯🔥🧯🧯🎠🎠🎠🎠🎠💫💯🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄

I LOVE THIS VIDEO😍😍 it made me love the song even more!!

*No entiendo por que es tan infravalorada esta canción, entiendo que esperaban algo mas "dance" pero en realidad el resultado final es bueno; es de las mejores colaboraciónes en lo que va del año, a mi parecer y gusto personal merece ser el hit del verano. Me encantó el video oficial, ame las referencias a otros clásicos de música tecno como Be My Lover, Destination Calabria, Call On Me, entre otros himnos del genero; trasmite mucha nostalgia ademas que Kim y Nicki lucen espectaculares.* Saludos 😎🤙🇳🇮
Nicki!!!

Nicki give me life ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😭
The direction and costumes for this were really cool!!
There’s a quality to Nicki that’s unmatched. People keep going on about her doing a versus battle but her peers are Jay-Z, Eminem, Nas and rappers of that calibre, I’m sure she’d rinse those too! Very proud of Kim also, I hope she goes galactic.

Like I get LITERAL CHILLS! The way NICKI DOES IT IS LIKE NO OTHER! Truly the Queen of RAP! 🦄🦄💜🫶🏾
I’m in tears 😭…. Nicki is sooooo iconic. She fits in any genre effortlessly….. I love  love love love her so much. God bless you ❤️❤️🙏🏾 you and Kim Petras really did a phenomenal job. Beautiful song and beautiful video ❤💯
Queen
😮😮🙈
Nicki Minaj is undeniably the most undisputed opponent in the Female Rap game. She can blend in with the old & new. Keep stinging her that Scammy, playing with her numbers (YouTube & billboard) "Allegedly". She's the ishhhhhh🦄🦄🦄💗  Kim Petras nailed & embodied this song. Beautifully done Love😘
No matter what other says....I LOVE THESE SO MUCHHH💗💗💗
Bye I found a new loop🦋

Eu amei
It’s an amazing music video but I feel like it dosnt match the vibe of the song. The song needed a harder drop, or a drop at all for this music video.
Amazing
Ate. The end.
The Background Music reminds of Work Hard, Play Hard by Akon & David Guetta
A parte da nicki ta tudo
eu esperava mais do clipe
Its here flops
Arrasou no clipe
Nicki flow is insane 🔥🔥🔥
VERY SUGGESTIVE... ❤❤❤
Nicki Minaj is just DIFFERENT. 🔥🦄
They killed this they sound good together
Nicki Minaj OUEEN OF RAP
Is it only me that watches this  then go to Princess Diana ft ice spice, then go to WTF ft youngboy, then RedRubyDaSleeze then coming back here
Devine Dollies 🫶🫶
Omg this video was amazing love Nicki❤🥰🔥
❤❤❤
Nicki Minaj ❤❤❤❤ &  Kim Petras❤❤❤ song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
nicki minaj its the best I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU i think cardi B its not a competition for nicki when u hear nicki minaj u now that that's the queennnnnnnn when you hear nicki minaj spid nicki minaj wrote it and no no no no shame
Idk why but Kim seems corny and not as on beat, confident and cool as usual… I think Nicki made her nervous and it read all over her face and in her movements.
From this song drop I can’t find myself  going a day without listening to it
IM GAGGING OMG
Ate ❤️👌😭
This is really our queen. For us real barbz, I’m so proud of us for pushing her longevity for this long. 08 til now and til the death of me. Love all you real ones ❤   Side note I did not expect Kim to eat this much, knew Nicki would though queen of rap WBK. What a bop!!
Nicki fire y’all better stop playing with her and get on fucxchibg board before you miss the boat
Nicki made me cry! She is still doing what  she loves. She’s been hated on, lied on, failed in the public eye( not to me), doubted and called the bad guy. She still pulled through!!!! I can barley get through one hater! I love you Nicki
Nicki is life! Yeeeeeeees
No one has even TOUCHED the legacy Nicki has made. She isn’t even finished yet. When she leaves it’ll be a sad day for music.
I want to see this Trending #1 let’s go! 🔥
The views are flying
They fact they Kim Petras and ice both sponsored by bose so iconic🤭🤍

I’m sorry but Kim needs to fire her team and find her some new people.. I really wanted this video to be sickening for her since she got that Nicki feature! But it feels cheap, low budget and just not it.
〽️〽️

Nicki Minaj is truly the 👑 of Rap, MTV VIDEOS, Global charts, Billboards, and #1 Global Fanbase. Her Genuine lyrics have crossed over to a Meaningful Significance vibe old-school and new school . She's truly 🔝  5 Best Rappers Ever💕❤️🔝🔝💯👑👍
2:25 umm Nicki pink underwear showing. Is that apart of outfit? Or Nicki just show the front but not back i noticing. That was a mistake maybe
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
BOOOOOOOOP
Y’all realize how many different genres Nicki gave us this year and last year? She’s the most versatile female rapper ever. No question about it.
Still can't believe that Kim Petras use to be a boy. Amazing work on the transformation and sounds like a woman. The song is dope! Kim Petras & Nicki Minaj look bomboliciouz. 😍
OMG is beautiful ❤❤❤

not my fav....
Nicki is literally the queen of rap PERIODTT!!! You can deny that all you want, but facts don't care about your feelings boo😘 She really paved the way for all the rap girls in the game, writes her own lyrics and basically made a female rapper starter pack. She raised an entire generation and still does. Our queen is still popping after 15 years in the game. She is and forever will be THE GOAT and the best female rapper that ever lived
😍😍😍😍😍
Queen ate so bad 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
Get it you two! Nicki is the blueprint. 🔥
The MV is so good but the clarinet scene is so dumb😭
Kim Petra’s keeps looking worse

All I got to say is this woman better be happy Nicki hopped on her track….mamas devoured!!😍

Fire 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This was amazing!
Damn Kim n mama really killed diz 💜💜💜😍🥺🥰💫✨🎧🎤🎵🖤👑
It's a cool song + the visuals. Mixing eras and genres.. I'm getting like Europop in the melody and the flute with the costume is also giving me like 2010's Europop vibes. Then other parts of the video are very contemporary - the bubblegum pop aesthetic plus the Latex/ BDSM imagery that is pretty popular today. Then you've got Nicki and her rap which is always pretty stellar. It's a cool vibe too, a little bit sad but at the same time a little bit euphoric. Quite a cool direction all in all! Slay. Really pleased for Kim, she's come really far! <3
😘❤️❤️❤️👌
Chii anyways stream princess Diana 👑
I love the way that Kim is being recognized in the pop industry… she’s mother 🛐
Its nicki for me everytime
YESS it’s Barbie and it’s Kim Petras

MOTHERS
50k views with 32k likes IS AMAZING 😍
So proud of kim rn im gonna cry
Well I can certianly say the lyrics and feeling envoked in the song this is based on/ripping the catchy synth and beat from, "Better Off Alone" are somehow miles ahead with the entirety of the lyrics just being, "Do you think you're better off alone?,  Talk to me, ooh-ooh, talk to me"
Nicki s'est la reine ❤❤❤❤
the video made me like the song a lot more
Y'all let's stream this hit to death!! Let's take it to #1 on BB.

Also the yoga mat dancing?? Eric Prydz - “Call on Me” reference?!
BUNS AND BARBS TOGETHER!!!!🤝

Nicki ran out of things to talk about in her verses because she was just talking about this in her other verse. What a joke.
💕💕💕
It’s barbie and it’s kim petras ooh aah

Warms my heart every time i see Nicki! But makes me so happy seeing her collab with actual barbz! This video was amazing and Nicki DEVOURED those looks and Kim popping out with the choreo was soooo cute!
Queen for a reason ❤
Momma ate and left no crumbs 😍

The fact that Nicki and Kim have to bite new music is bullshit. But all dem girls and I mean little girls steal better bears.

Still don’t like the song but I’ll always support the Queen
Let’s be honest Nicki Minaj is an icon,a legend and the moment,Barbz never disappoints us.She slayed for sure.
Why would NICKI jump on a song like THIS when she’s has taste and is highly critical on choosing her features is beyond me… she really lowered the bar now. Hopefully she makes that whack song chart. Go barbz ig

Listen the song isn’t  bad but the way Kim teased this song non stop and even if it was said jokingly she said it’s gonna be the best summer hit. all of that just took the expectations to high and now we ended up with a hit that isn’t bad but also isn’t that exiting

Strangely, even if the intro is short and simple, I think its absolutely perfect. The vibes we got during the tract from both of them brought us to an ending that feels like its not finished, there's more, its just the beginning... in a good way of course. IDGAF about the people who say that's not a good song, I'm dying for this.
The bubblegum bouncing ball needs an account for this amount of iconography, YEAH!
Damn Nicki you look flawless in red❤️
This was nothing but amazing. Well done Kim & Nicki! <3

Cute video

Nicki Minaj always slays! ❤❤, thank Kim for collaborating with Queen Nicki 😍😍❤️❤️.
Calling Kesha a liar DOESN'T make you look cute Kim. Also dating a sex offender doesn't make you look cute either Nicki. Let alone having a baby with one. Both working alongside a rapist also isn't cute. You're both garbage.
It’s giving coconuts music video budget 💀
Nicki still top❤
The vocals and visuals 🔥
🦄🦄🧡✨😻😻
I wanted some blick blick video but this is amazing
TWO BARBIES 😻❕

The visuals! The choreography! The looks! The budget girl! WOW! What a fabulous music video! Has everything you want from a pop star! As a trans woman who's the same age as Kim it's truly amazing to finally see her win & get all the success she deserves! She's literally making history as a trans woman becoming the first trans pop superstar! It's so surreal to see a fellow trans woman get to this level of fame & success! Kim & Nicki are ABSOLUTE QUEENS! So excited for this collab & music video! SO ICONIC! She's paving the way for other trans artists! Trailblazer! Keep shining Queen! You've got a collab with THE QUEEN OF RAP! IT'S BARBIE & KIM PETRAS! ❤️

Nicki Minaj is a great lyricist, don't ever doubt her pen game. She's the GOAT of Female Rap! She's been popping since her debut till date that's legendary 💯
Lets go
queen
Nicki looks way too good and popped off way too hard. I fear that she’s gonna take over the girlies with this album.
if theres one thing nicki gonna do she gonna eat on every song shes featured on
Im waiting on you "Alone" ❤
This song should of been a big hit
Kim Petras and Nicki Minaj is a huge inspiration to me and I WILL produce a song for them one day.
Nicki is a lyrical chameleon. She can just easily blend in and compliment any rapper/ singer she hops on a track with
I've been a fan of Kim Petras since 2018. I've been watching her success grow throughout the years, and I couldn't be more proud of her! She LITERALLY got to collab with the Queen of Rap! I wish nothing but more success come her way <3 Her talent deserves more recognition! :)
Oh she has that MTV VMA in the bag this year!!!!
Nicki Minaj is the ONLY QUEEN OF RAP.
When are we getting a EuroPop Remix? Still a bop, but that remix would make it go #1!
Finally 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg yasss
everyone just talks about Nick in the comments and forgets that the song has Kim kkkkk
This Thumbnail is ICONIC 🥰
Queens
The fact that Nicki is still here… doing her thing and STILL inspiring many people is INSANE. She’s a QUEEN for a reason! Love her! Make sure to stream Alone you guys! And hey Kim and Nicki 💕🩷

I can’t wait ❤ this song defenitly brings out my girly pop energetic vibe, nicki Minaj got me twerking in my room with closed doors as Kim Petras makes me feel like I need to wear all pink and stilettos. These ladies are such icons and never fail to get me out my depression, and ofc the queen of rap, Nicki, never disappoints!! I’m so excited for a music video, I appreciate how hard they work together to please us, and now Nicki gives so many artists chances to be in a song with her, this is truly ICONIC! ♥︎♡♥︎♡   Edit: I'm so grateful I got to be on this premiere, their outfits slayed, they looked so stylish and sexy and it was such a vibeeee ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YAAAAAAAAAAAAS
I cannot waiiiiiiit
WE READY!!🦄
I swear this better be a catchy remix 😭 Because this collaboration has so much potential. And the music video is going to be so good. I can't believe people are streaming the song the way it is right now. The version they released totally seems like a joke.

I love how versatile Nicki is. She not only works with the big and well known pop singers e.g Ariana, but she also works with underrated and equally talented singers like Kim Petras.
