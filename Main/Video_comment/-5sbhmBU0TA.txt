@Digga D, I challenge you @fame and drip freestyle by @khaligraph Jones.
@khaligraph Jones can you nail on this beat challenge..??

Difference is Dvs had no record deal with millions or a massive platform he was just straight trapping and putting lyrics on beats 👌🏼 digga could only wish he made what dvs did from just trapping. Respect ur olders

) The governor of Texas on June 7 signed into law TX SCR3, a bill “condemning China's practice of involuntary organ harvesting,” after it passed both the state Senate and House of Representatives.  This bill was introduced in the state Senate in January this year. It was approved in the Senate in April, and in the House of Representatives in May.  “For the better part of two decades, China's communist regime has been engaged in the vile practice of forcibly removing human organs for transplant,” wrote the bill, which also lists numerous evidence of the forced organ harvesting, and urges the U.S. government and the international community to stop this atrocity. It also encourages the medical community to raise awareness of the forced organ harvesting so that Texans will not unwittingly commit such a crime by engaging in transplant tourism in China.  A Moral Issue Several newspapers covered this new law. The Dallas Morning News, the largest newspaper in Dallas, reported the bill’s approval in the state legislature on June 1. Citing information from international media, the report said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) targeted hundreds of thousands of detainees for the forced organ harvesting, with Falun Gong practitioners being the primary targets.  The Facts, the largest newspaper in Brazoria County, published a letter from local resident Ms. Jiang, who thanked state representatives for supporting this bill. According to Donate Life Texas, the only official organ and tissue donor registry in the state, about 60% of residents in Brazoria County have registered for organ donation. Still, it takes several years to find a matching kidney or liver. In China, less than 0.02% of the population is registered for organ donations, but organs can be obtained within two weeks. Researchers found that prisoners of conscience, including Falun Gong practitioners, had been killed for their organs in China.  By raising this moral issue, SCR3 will help more people to become aware of this tragedy. Before going to China for an organ transplant, people should evaluate the situation and reconsider their decision if the promised organs would be taken from non-consenting donors.  New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung in the Greater San Antonio area published a letter from Ms. Lamb on June 19. She praised SCR3 because it would inform Texans of the risks of having organ transplants in China. Forced organ harvesting is an inhuman crime, and she wanted to thank the legislative support on this matter.  Montgomery County Gazette in the Greater Houston area published a letter on June 20 from a reader named Ms. Liu Jing. She was in China when the CCP began to suppress Falun Gong in 1999, and there was massive hate propaganda targeting Falun Gong. With no access to independent news, she believed the defamatory propaganda. She did not know what Falun Gong really was until 2004 when she moved to the U.S. A Chinese friend told her the facts about Falun Gong and about the benefits brought by the practice. She subsequently began to practice Falun Gong.  Because of her own experience, Ms. Liu knew many Chinese people have been deceived by the CCP. As a result, she has been working with other practitioners informing both Chinese and Americans of Falun Gong and the persecution. She believes the suppression will come to an end when more people know about the CCP’s brutality and lies.

To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
This tune is cold

Nice
Cold 🥶
I'm sorry random youtube comment scroller, if you're such a real g that you might not agree with this, but the only thing Digga deserves cred for when making songs is his cadence, ear for it, and wordplay + delivery. However the worth of what he's saying is just shit, he really is just another sellout like all the other UK rappers out now. Culture vultures really done fucked up when they invested in the UK scene, cos now everyone and their cousin's sister walking outside thinking they're immortal now. I don't hate Digga but I don't like him either. Just respect his artistic cadence cos of how fleshed out it is
“The real side of bush , west Drayton and Hayes town” cmonnnnnnnn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Unfortunate facts to hear...Provocative clothing plays a role in sexual harassment
The 1 dollar notes though lol
Digga d has fell off now let’s be honest
Woi!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That’s that old rappop
A rap song you can dance to
Warning; Here is how it will play out   1. If Jesus Christ comes back to take his church and found you not saved (not believing at him as the savior through believing he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and that he risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now) you will be left behind and there will be great tribulation you will suffer on earth and that will be God's judgement.   The only way to be saved at tribulation after left behind by Jesus when majority of Christians have disappeared is to not take the mark of the beast on your forehead or right hand and you will be killed or starve to death.   2. Death always occur you can die at any time and the huge issue is if you die before Christ returns and you were not believing at him as the savior( that is not believing at Christ that he was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and risen again on the third) your soul will go straight to Hell for eternity, at Hell you will burn but not consumed.   Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.    Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.   Hebrews 10:4, 10  For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.   No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.   Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.   After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.   Romans 6:6  Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.   As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.   Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..

gotta get the hometown remix too now
for some reason this sounds like alz
Nah he went crazy on this. What the FUCK
Video would’ve went harder if he had a Urus, Cullinan, G Wagan and a SVR pull up 😭
1:10 @ for medical purposes as recommended by my gp please
DVS is a dutty nonce. Stop bringing him up. Digga D used the same beat and what! Doesn’t mean he’s ‘paying homage’ to a certy nonce. Anyone stickin you for dvs or mentioning him in a good way is just as bad as him. Dvs is a wrongunnn
🐐🔥
Who remember the Dvs version 🔥
Digga d never let's us down 🥶🥶
Digga living in Florida?,
What happened to “you still cool with the kilburn niggas, erm ion really feel them niggas” or “everyone in south kilburn is wet” swear Digga had personal beef with ssk😂
Lit 🔥 man Digga
Need to remix of ‘me too’
Digga 🐐
Pov ppl don't know the original song

Rah I actually get the concept for this project, he’s using beats/ inspiration from the artist that he grew up on, which is why the cover evolves from baby through to now!

DVS in jail:  Yoo that's my shitt
Digga paid homage to DVS by using the same flow DVS has on this beat. You gotta respect Digga. I’m so happy he’s moving away from Drill and leaning towards Rap. He’s the champ at the moment in my opinion
Na digga arrd for this i still play dv’s till this day!
