My Boy Might Have Lost But He Beat The Shit Out Of Fousey

Deji sleep him
I’m glad deji dropped his ego after losing this fight cause otherwise he just would’ve been a massive failure and wouldn’t have won his 2 fights
Happy 1 year anniversary
Wassabi vs Mayweather exibition alex has lots of fans people would love to see that
Dawg Alex Wassabi is saying nice things to deji 💀 😂
Alex isn't prepared for this because he knows that Deji will won
😂😂😂
He pulled a concussion
Who else is here after Deji's 1st win
1:45 why did deji gulp like that💀
these two are so fit for each other i want more face offs like these
4:32-4:38😂😂😂
Bruh these is like a try not to kiss challenge between them 😂😂😂
I don't think Deji understands that his fight with fousey will determine weather his career takes off. But I'm team Alex Wassabi all the way, and I can proudly say that Deji will get finished by fousey, so he needs to make it make sense
cap
I remember paying for this, never buying another deji fight
12:43 bruh Deji said he wont fight again
4 months ago deji takes another  loss oops spoiler alert
12:40 well deji u are fighting again
Alex looks like he’s 17
Funny how deji says he got the better over his sparring partners…..yet his first coach showed footage of deji getting dropped and kneeling down again 🤣🤣
12:44 well this is now awkward lmao
I'm a little late to the party started with the fight came back to watch this lol @ deji he retired after an L to Alex
Friendly face off ever 😂
Man talks about insecurity while wearing a hoodie cap himself. 😂 😂
ogus 25fth
why do all uk youtubers have thick ass minds and think they are all gods when it comes to boxing literally deji is the definition of cringe and his ego is thru the roof and does this just for clout
this is so lit idk why
👁️
20:34
My 3 y/o cousin sister atleast knows how to punch 👊
This is like an acting sketch😂
can’t wait to see deji fight again and say he’s had three events again and all the experiences but dej how did those experiences go ? all losses !
Deji: I’m not fighting again if I lose.  Also Deji: loses fight and continues fighting.  The guy just keeps contradicting himself
Be yourself next time if you ever fight again
If I was ever in a face to face like this ahead of my boxing fight, I honestly wouldn't say a word and just look into there eyes for a few minutes and smile.
From all the hard this Alex Wassabi vets? He's just a genuinely nice kid ain't he 😂
Deji’s fans are delusional
'never underestimate deji's ability to fuck things up' : barack o biden
I hope he fights again so he can be 0-4 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀😆
Deji was lying the whole video 😂😂
This was more of a soft core porn than a face off
Deji is a 🤡😂😂😂
Obvious who the more respectable man is
You can clearly see this fella is acting the bollox. Sitting there, staring Alex down with his hood up and nodding his head ever so calmly thinking he's smooth. This whole though guy act really doesn't suit him. He really needs to drop the though guy act. He was favored by most when he was himself and doing comedy. Alex was way much more humble and respectful.
Deji says all this and didn’t even try in the ring lmao 🤦
The fact that Leji still has fans is crazy lmfao mans is all bark no bite, a literal liar who claims he'd stop boxing if he lost and now he's back getting ready to go 0-4 lets go leji
Intro song?
Deji seems like he's at Wasabi's Psychology clinique😄
Deji can't be seen  Man is so black 🖤
Deji is just a moving joke that never fails to put a laughs on faces
I admire his spirit deji,. Should continue fighting
I'm sorry why is this intimate 🤣 alex is looking into deji eyes with sincere look on his face I can't 🤣
I say dejis gonna win
This aged like milk
its hard to feel bad for deji 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This face 2 face was just an excuse for them to have a conversation 😂😂
Alex sounds like he’s flirting the entire time
I swear to god it’s like Deji wants to be rude and intimidating but Alex is just too nice. It’s like Deji hurted is own feelings just by being rude to Alex. LOL
i found alex wassabi's channel  he is also became a friend with a youtuber guava juice
18:12 Welp, that didn’t age well
Wassabi is goofy, but he is a nice person we can’t lie
Embarrassing two betas
This just reminds me of "orgestwennifif" (if you know you know)
omg i didnt even know about that fight.. damn and deji lost oh god so dumb. congrats to wassabi!!
Be humble man
Wow this video aged horribly for Deji😂
Vinnie is 3/10 but fucking ENDED you lmfaoooo
This was the worst face 2 face I've ever watched in my life omds😭😭😭😭
Deji:I'm gonna destroy you,I'm gonna go right through you Also Deji:(loses to a beginner)
0&3
This is so much funny to watch now what Deji is saying 😂😂😂
Knock out power 🤣🤣🤣🤣👌🏾
Still won't win 😕 wats the point you embarrassment
Alex is a humbled and nice guy, he trained to protect his family before deji even challenged him. He deserved the W
Anybody Else Bothered About The Actual Sound Of All The Swallowing They’re Doing? 😭
Alex, from the start, just wanted for them both to make it to the end. And that's what happened so I know he is pretty happy and contented with this fight.
Deji ate those words march 5th
Alex is such an actor ffs he belongs on Nickelodeon
I'm glad Deji lost. Guys a clown.
This aged well
Yea this is shit
Deji out here losing to the worst YouTube boxers
Manja kali
LMFOAOA THIS IS MORE LIKE A THERAPY SESSION 😂
They could acc be bestfriends
love alex. seriously
i absoluely love alex, he's so cool.
Alex🥶🥶
Deji is doing a prime moments connor mcgregor by talking all this shit and losing every time
Acctually love wassabi, hes so chill and nice
Love the kindness in Alex ☺️
it's always the person who's humble, gets the W
Deji gets battered everywhere he goes.
Watching this after the fight...😬
We can finally end this stupid debate. And this goes out to all deji fans deji can’t fight he trash. He had all the stamina and the practice. He’s just trash😂😂😂
3:0
Deji will do better👍🏾 this  fight setback won’t stop Him
Yeah long day💀
Deji tries too hard to act hard lol
sad.
Deji: A LACK OF CONFIDENCE Me and everyone else: Nigga whauuut?
lol this aged like milk big W to Alex
Ahh hell nah 💀
This is just sad to watch, Deji in this video is so cringe he’s acting like he’s all that while Alex is calm and realistic.  To be honest at this point if anyone defences him they are just going to be disappointed again and again, this dude has lost 3 fights now.  Time to give up the gloves, you just were meant for them
I've watched both from young. I wanted both to win to be honest but man Alex is way more humbler and the fact he won makes it even better
3 things inevitable in life Death Taxes Deji saying hes gonna win and then taking the L
Glad you lost
This is even funnier now
Deji lost again~🤣 Deji fans are going to cry again~🤭🤫😂😂😂
I’ve been rooting for deji for the longest time but low key I hope Alex does well too, I feel like deji is the definition of trying to hard, this act of deji being a “bad ass” doesn’t stick man I just don’t believe it.
I'm proud deji tried his best and done better than last time and Alex beats deji in all height reach weight
Deji be like: I'm gonna eat through you, you're nothing.....  proceeds to a losing hattrick 😂😂😂😂
i'm gonna eat through you, you're nothing.....  proceeds to a losing hattrick 😂😂😂😂
L boxer
Deji haven't changed 🤣🤣🤣🤣 deji trash talkin and still loses
Leji
Well this didn't age well😔
Ohhhhhh dear Deji don't speak about boxing ever again
Why
Humble guys always win everything 😉 He won
Lul
This didn’t age well
Deji should never box once algún
And he still lost 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️what a damn shame 🤦🏾‍♂️there is no redemption after that 🤦🏾‍♂️😂😔 he lost every match and 2 of them he should of won but he got pressured
Deji should be embarrassed 😂
Here we go again
Idk if it’s an act but Alex seems nice.
I still can’t take Alex seriously
hahahaha, deji. ngl, you are a clown man
Deji! Idk if you're reading this but I wanted to say that your fans have gained so much respect for you. Even through a lose it was still respectable and idk what is in the future for that part of your career, but just know that your fan base is behind you now more than ever. The loss sucks but it's only love sent towards you man.
1:44 sum farted😂
All trash talk straight to bin
This is so funny now that deji lost. He’s so trash
Unlucky on taking the L
Deji underestimated the last 2 opponents and looking at this video he underestimated Alex too.
Na man he lost
0-3 man’s record worse than CM punk
Deji istg if you loose to ALEX WASSABI 😂💀
Too bad Deji wasnt able to quite make it with the boxing. Excited to see what he does next though. The life lessons that he has undouptably learnt will hopefully stick this time.
0-3
L
Keep playin in london so ur whole city knows ur ass 😂😂😂 W Alex
Who else is here after the loss? 🥲
Deji was so cringe the whole time idk how y’all still always be backing him up lmao
This aged like a fine carton of milk.
The fucking cringest shit iv ever seem
i know some people deleted their comments 😭
14:25 wow
Welp
Omg please don’t box again no one cares about redemption after the 100th time it’s getting boring now
POV :Deji watching this video after the fight 🤣
who else is watching after deji got absoulutely D U S T E D
Deji was acting tuff for someone who was 0-2 & now he’s 0-3 💀 love you Deji but it’s time to stop boxing. Keep slimming down & do YouTube man.
ok out of the 8 years that i have been watching alex, I have NEVER heard him cuss EVER and when I heard him my jaw DROPPED.
DEJI QUIT YA LOSER
Give this guy away. Only black man to take 3 L’s to the white man
Retire
Loooooooool 3rd L and took this one to a bitch
Well deji said if he lost this would be his last fight that aged well should have posted I am gonna shock the world would have stand a better chance of winning
Walking L
The sass in deji is fucking stupid cause he gets boxed by every shitter in this world
Erm……. Watched this whole thing after the fight……. Is Deij like a meme at this point now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Told you guys he was gonna lose HAHA lol big L🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well.....
man sounds like a fanboy to deji
who is here after deji loss
25:25 bruh... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can’t take this seriously fs🤣🤣
What an L
Awkward to watch after the L...
"i wanna show the world that i can box"😂😂😂😂😂😂..... Just quit boxing
Anyone here after the fight. 💀
For Deji, this is simply about him loosing weight. He's still to dumb to Realize fat loss doesn't mean reconditioning his body, nor auto increased stamina. Deji last 2 fights have shown him come prepared to fight 2 completely different ways and loose. Alex is much taller and Is gunna drill Deji and split his shit
“under estimating me” lol
Hold ur head up Deji ur still a fuckinh G icon everything for my childhood
Losee
whos here after deji lost lol
Wow I'm speechless wtf deji
Btw deji lost
Deji lost 😞
deji actin tuff for nun💀
Deji tries to act tuff
Alex wasabi got Deji with if him saying if he loses he won’t fight again😂
Hard to watch now
It's clear deji gunna get rocked again
Halal ham was a douche before the fight against salt papi and deji was kind of the same at the press conference. INSTANT KARMA.
Anyone here after Deji lost, after all this talk he gave as well... 😂
im sorry but deji stop acting tough!!!!
THIS IS SO IRONIC NOW
bruh this is too positive shit talk more
AGED SO WELL @deji
Deji is still undefeated ................................ ......................................... ......................................... ......................................... ......................................... on losing all of his fights 💀💀
Damnnnn bruh Lzzzzzzzzz
damn
Who is here after Deji lost?
Leji
All his fans can stop talking about dejis imaginary natural talent that we've literally never seen and we can FINALLY end the narrative of "if deji had stamina he would be good"
Legi
sad.
You did good 🤕
Deji put up a good fight. Sad to see him lose tho
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
0-3  holy fuck
Leji The Lank
who here after the fight?
This didn’t age well
Leji
Leji
Man boxing is not for Deji, period.
Leji 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Deji my 6 year old sister asked if you want to fight? About your level?
Leji
Leji
THIS AGED SO BADLY
Well this aged badly
deji could have clocked alex and knocked him out mutiple times if he would have actually threw a fuckibg punch
Well this didn't go as planned
Absolute shithouse
This aged like milk
Rip 😔
Deji just lost
Deji lost guys.
I really like you Deji but 0-3 please quit.
L
Oof
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Let us all down man 🙁
Deji lost fak he shoudnt been disrespecting him
why does this guy still get this "hes so much better now" hype each fight 😂 hes acc shit, I could probably box better than him honestly, and I've not trained in about 2 years
BRUH WHOS HERE AFTER DEJI LOST AGAIN
disappointing
WHAT A LOSER
why are they whispering the whole time
Why is Alex so damn nice tho 😂😂😂
is it me or does Alex sound like Michael Jackson
I came here to see some ppl mad dogging each other not sucking their knobs
Ain’t no way Alex is 5’9, I thought fs he was atleast 6’2
Well they are nice to Each other
Ahh the face of was nice
is that the guy from NXT UK?
Andy Shepherd NXT UK Commentator
I'm fr rooting for alex
Dejis so defensive, I think it’s just a lack of true confidence in himself. Good luck to both boxers
This is actually a good face to face to watch
respect to alex
Does anyone know how to buy the fight without a card? Like can I pay through Google store or something? I don't have a credit card
This has to be awkward for them 😭
Bruh there is no if DEJI WINNING THIS
These looks like they are on date and talking about friendly match after their lunch
This wasn’t even a boxing face to face more like a boys chat 😂😂
Alex wassabi's confidence comes from the fact that he has retirement money. Other than that it's all the Act lol. Alex Wassabi is not even in the position to be cocky. Neither of them are and that's what gets people f***** up lol. Dej being more humbled is nice though. That means you could only be something behind that I hope.
I don't think Wasabi has ever seen a boxing face to face/press conference before.
Deji is trying so hard to be aggressive but wasabi makes it hard for him being so nice 😂
Height doesn't matter in boxing and this man Alex is literally trying to get him to get him in the corner. He's trying to make dej get him in the corner so he can use it to his advantage.
deji is such a try hard
Alex wasn’t disrespectful. He was polite in his confidence of his victory.
soo.....why doesnt deji just say...i hope alex shows up and does better than he did when he sparred and got knocked the F out by fouseytube.    deji lost 2 times sure.. but he never got knocked out in sparring or in the ring. lol   especially by a guy like fouseytube ...a guy who uses his face to stop punches. lol
Watch it be a draw
yo why is alex byting his lips like bruh
alex is wearing a “nice guy” mask in this video so hard
😴😴
Alex is being too humble and it’s like he knows that he is gonna win. I am scared for deji  cause i really don’t want to him to lose this fight but it seems that alex is actually decent
Why tf is alex so kind
Deji in god mode 😭
They’re so nice to each other and they’re gonna smash the shit outa each other tonight
Yall are blind I could see Alex’s body language he seems nervous
Seems like Alex has probably gotten better, yet he doesn’t fully understand his own strengths.
Why are they fighting
why does deji keep saying "people underestimate me and no one supports me" when 90% of the audience supports him
I rate the respect between them 👏
Best of luck
Alex is a nice bloke
I’ll tell you what. Sometimes it’s the confident nice personality type that is more dangerous than the aggressive trash talking one. Gotta be careful Deji.
Boring
May the best man win! 🇬🇧 v 🇺🇸 🥊
Deji's dead serious about this one YO !!! Super exited !
Alex sounds high
this feels like a kinda weird first date
Alex has such perfect white teeth lol, imagine Deji knocks one out
Alex is my fave childhood youtuber. It's difficult for me to see him be intimidating due to his contents. Nevertheless, I'm on his side on this. But for sure the two will do good. Best of luck!
The only problem is let’s hope the weight cut doesn’t get to him
The bromance is real
This cringe af
Such a cringy faceoff 😂
i paid the PPV to see Deji lose
Alex is such a nice guy 😂😭
I got a bad feeling for deji, he’s too confident
Why is Alex such a chill person
Intro song?
It's a fixed fight probably anyway
Djei loss fight  to day is game over u 3 losse  dont box more u talk to much show me box to moro is donw  dont be chiken. Bet ale hate 3 face Get donw nock out 😁
i find face offs so intimate
alex atw
Bring this home tonight Deji
Wtf
0-3
i honestly dont knoww alex or deji really well ive followed deji more but the way alex talks it isnt like he is trolling. i hope this is a good fight
deji is a nice guy but he does the same thing evertime goes in with his chest up and loses and first fight he blame himself and last fight trainers deji no more excuse this time to show up if not retire
Alex just wants to have fun😂😂😂
Deji gone get fucked up omm for the 3rd time 😂😂
MY MANS ALEX BETTER WIN
“I have the height and reach advantage” didn’t say a word about actually boxing. This kid is a joke lol
They know they gonna lose😂😂
See man Alex is very genuine. I have so much respect for Alex. Ready to watch this great fight👍
What’s the song at the beginning?!?!?!??
alex is a nice guy
The whole "im gonna toy with you then knock you out" is cringe asf
Alex makes me happy
Dude u gotta respect em both for putting in the work. I fw Alex wasabi smiling his way through this. Deji looks very determined I’m excited for this man
They scheduled this fight at the worst time possible because Covington and masvidal fight the same night
Imma laugh when deji loses again lol
This is so cringe 😬
ill be rooting for Alex Wassabi. Hopefully its a good fight
Mfs sound like 2 high school buddies catching up
you’d have to be shit to let deji knock you out
That’s crazy I ain’t know he was 31, it kinda explains why he is more “mature” and basically in control of his emotions
Aslong as deji goes the full fight without a towel being thrown in, then I don’t care if he lose be majority vote.
Imagine alex wins💀
💯💯💯
Wtf is this. A date? Lool
I love how there so nice two each other
Wasabi tucked up
HAHAHA DEJI IS GOING TO EAT HIS FLESH HAHAHA
Im rooting for deji, please win this man
Alternate title : Face 2 Face ASMR
bruh i like alex actually hahaa
I know a lot of these comments say Alex is nervous just cuz he is smiling and being kind and what not but if u have watched him long enough u know that’s just him
2018: Deji what's your favorite food Deji: August 25th 2022: What about now Deji: March 5th
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
COME ON DEJI
Demi was so honest
What do you mean?
Guys, we need your help to stop the genocide war in Ukraine. Put the pressure on your government all you can, they must close the sky above Ukraine so we can stop putin's nazis for good.
Alex wassabi seems cool guy
I like this, deji has just seen too much of his brothers bullshit that here he is also tryna do the same thing: Toxic trashtalking, but Alex just shows him how being nice and kind is always a good option. I actually like alex, hr may be this nice because of a lack of confidence. But that doesnt matter. Im done with these cringe youtube face2face's. "Im an animal" "im a god" "im gonna kill you", childish. This is a mature real talk
Wassabi nuts need to drop already
Alex got deji on a leash on this face off
The questions Alex asked pretty much exposed the fact that Deji even knows he going to lose . At the end of the day it’s all business and deji has a bigger plan .
Alex is going to win. They both are not good but i feel like deji think because he train for 2-5 weeks hes a good boxer. I think alex is right,  Deji has had it so easy that he thinks just a little bit of training would make him a good boxer. Deji should have just took like 6-9 months then tried to fight someone. I think Deji is the level of alex wassabi 1 year ago. Alex is way better then deji and they both suck. Time for deji's 3rd loss and all the memes.
Alex is the exact definition of “kill them with kindness” 😅
This made me love alex
Nice conversation
When deji first said March 5 it gonna be August 25 thing all over again
These guys way too Friendly.
The way this is wholesome has me me deaddd 😂😂
This was so nice to watch, friendly confrontation.
Saying that ur gonna quit fighting after losing is such a bad mentality to have. You learn and improve from your losses. Why quit after all that hard work. If you did win, it would be understandable. Alex just humble asf. That’s why I want him to win.
I told y’all Alex is too nice
that was really gay
wasabi has a nice face shame its gonna be mashed up
Respect to Alex tbh lol, he’s just having fun. It’s so hard for Deji to act tough or mean because Alex is just so respectful and wants Deji to be a good fighter so he can have a real competition
Come on Deji!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥💰👊
Wtf?
Wtf are they flirting? They are one step before exchanging phone numbers
alex is gonna win
If killing with kindness was a human, it would be Alex 😂. Rooting for Deji tho
90:59:59
deji your gunna knock this bitch out
Good luck dej, keep focused, you're becoming a changed man for the better, don't let this one slip 👍👍
It’s impossible to hate Alex because he’s never been a hatable guy lol I think he’ll really surprise us I can’t even lie but I hope Deji wins...
I’m not sure Deji will win this one but not from a lack of trying. Alex has also put in a ton of work and he doesn’t seem like a dumb opponent. But Deji does have heart. He may put more into this fight and come out on top.
Alex’s camp looked pretty legit. And Alex seems confident. Deji definitely put work in but he still seems like he is talking and is underestimating Alex
This was unexpectedly chill 🧔🏻‍♀️
Alex has definitely gone for the humble and win the crowd route
I’m team Deji but how can he talk about dead channels and wanting relevancy
Deji: do you have knockout power?  Alex: i- uh- yh- well i mean- yh
Deji is probably the worst boxer out of all the ‘YouTube boxers’ and he acts as if he was the best in the world.
Deji gonna give the uk a big w this time round
This the most humble face to face I'm ever seen no one has shouted once it's just sweet talk
fighting wassabi is like fighting your best friend
Friendliest Face off probably ever
They humble
Deji gonna look like this normally when he in his mid 40s
what a romanric face 2 face😂
Deji negs
It is time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read your Bible!!!
if only they both could get knocked out....Maybe a miracle will occur and they will simultaneously knock one another out then break each others necks while falling over
25:33 lmao 👽
Deji on sum staring contest shit
22:00 P A U S E 👽😳🕶🤏
15:06 Alex is possessed 👽⚰
Go go deji,dont wory
Auuguss twentei fif 👽🤪
I feel like Deji really wanted to go in on Alex but Alex was just too nice that Deji really didn't want to seem so evil 😂
Pawns
ima be honest i w want wasabi to win mainly bc he was part f my childhood more than deji but i know deji gonna win bc wassabi cant fight if im being honest
His confidence is kinda scary
Putin made Ukraine suffer. Russia bombs nuclear station, residential neighborhoods, kindergartens. Many people have already died in pain - peaceful citizens, little children. I beg you all to support PEACE. SUPPORT UKRAINE!!!
Love you dej!👮🏿‍♂️
This face to face is so mature and almost humble
26:02 hardest part to watch out of this whole date
Holy fuck Alex dominated this
so cringe
God this was so uncomfortable to watch. The guy in the flannel needs a beer or go cut some trees
And later that night they went on a nice dinner date
Deji is a 🤡. They only doing this for views.. there's nothing interesting about this
Yooo for a moment I thought they gonna make out!
Wasabi is clearly covering up his fear with a facade of being chill... Can't say who will win but money after this on deji...
Alex wasabi seems so humble
This is a date, not a face off lol
Alex is such a nice guy wtf 🤣🤣🤣
if deji losses this aswell i swear fml
NGl deji career is finished if he doesn’t win this fight
It's a draw
When are you going to box?
Ever since deji n dounjah broke up deji looks serious changed  a lot
Deji to cocky, and thats why he will lose..
is this love island
Alex is so humble and kind. I can’t picture this guy fighting but I’m excited to watch the both of them.
Alex being this respectful and kind has me nervous. He likely has something in the locker
The cold stare that deji gives to Alex 💀
Alex is so humble and kind. I can’t picture this guy fighting but I’m excited to watch the both of them.
Alex is so humble and kind. I can’t picture this guy fighting but I’m excited to watch the both of them.
Wasabi about to catch the biggest W
This was just a chill face to face, no aggressiveness or silly shouting, very respectful.
S
Wtf is this!!🤣 they should just kiss
Love the respect
‘You’ll see march 5th’ reminded me of ‘You’ll see august 25th’
I’m sorry but I can read a lot of the bull shit coming out of dejis mouth
Bruh can’t wait to see these to somewhat pro boxers fight this is the Deji we wanted with the Vinny fight. But now we have him let’s go deji
This is honestly gonna be just a chill fight, they are both mad respectful
Well this was cute 🥺😂
this is like 2 school girls talking about their day
Alex asking sus ass questions 😂 acting like he’s talking to a chick 😂
Alex is so humble and kind. I can’t picture this guy fighting but I’m excited to watch the both of them.
I know Job interviews are more intense than this
Nice
“I’ve never knocked someone out but I hurt them and make them give up” I’m not saying it’s not possible but he hurt a boxer better than him so bad that he “gave up” what does that mean. Alex Seems kind of like he wanted to have a better answer to the questions being asked.
25 minutes of face to face wtf lol Gettem dej!!!
There tryna be friends I just know
dont let me down deji im rooting for you🤞💪
Shit im betting on wazzabi cause of is confidence buy shit deji I’m getting that feelings that hes a starving animal locked up In a cage
This is a fucking comedy 😂😂😂
I hope you take this opportunity seriously. If you do you may become a pro champion belt and all.
Get a room already
Alex is so humble and kind. I can’t picture this guy fighting but I’m excited to watch the both of them.
This is fighters should converse 👍
I like time skip Deji a lot.
50/50 fight
Respect for being humble but wait till Alex gets battered
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
how does deji talk a big game when he’s literally the worst youtube boxer like by statistics he’s literally the worst one 😂😂 he took a knee against a tiktoker that he rated his boxing skills a 3/10
2:54 up until the guy in the middle interjects they are literally being kind and respectful to eachother especially Alex 💀
I really think Alex is gonna win, he's been putting in so much effort and has done some inane and intense training
im only 4 mins in and deji went from being a tough guy to softening up and talking with alex lmfao they act like they ona date getting to know each other LMFAO
I’m from USA, but fuck wasabi
Alex is so humble and kind. I can’t picture this guy fighting but I’m excited to watch the both of them.
this video is sus
IDK WHO TO ROOT FOR 😭 Both of you are my childhood
This is more like a therapy session
Alex looks a little toooooo excited
LETS GO ITS DEJI!!!!
This is sooooo fking moist
A few minutes in, I forgot this was a face off and not a chit  chat
After watching this, I don't know who to support now. I'm a big fan of Deji and always has been, but Alex is such a humble guy, always respecting Dejis efforts. I honestly don't know who to support, One of my favorite YT or the guy from my Home Country. Can't wait for the fight
They’re just having a conversation 😂😂😂😂😂
In reality, Deji doesn’t need a victory for redemption, we need to see put his all that’s it
this really doesnt give me much confidence for deji. he looks scared.
America all the way but deji u better win
Lol Deji already lost by choosing wassabi as an opponent. Tbh he deserves to lose for picking the guy who has no experience and is what people would call feminine. I hope alex wins he deserves it more 💯💯💯
this is actually a nice face off. some thing you don't see in most boxing fights.  that's nice
Wasabi is going to finish the fight round 4-5
I use this face off as asmr to help me sleep
Why do Americans always talk like they’re in a movie 😂
Deji on master mind games crazy crazy, boxing is all spiritual mental warfare you can see he's already won
deji if dont win against this guy im unsubscribing
why do they complement each other?
Deji asking someone  if they wanna fight, deji is scary and would not even fight Jake  when he confronted him.
Hyped for this
Is deji stupid at 19:43 Alex  said he is learning  combinations,  deji said he is learning  how to box.
Alex doesn’t actually seem fake now ngl. Send decent and down to Earth
These 2 gonna end up kissin in the end
cringe
Lol deji looked him straight in the eyes the whole time, that’s intimidating
I love the vibe from Alex and confidence from deji, they're both confident in the work they've done. May the best man win!
Alex gonna throw it
i won’t be happy if deji wins by split decision, it’s majority or tko
You cannot beat my childhood 😾
Alex cant be mean😂
Deji is trying to hard in this
21:31 respect
Deji you better lose this mf you whole entire career for boxing is definitely over if you lose mane we rooting for you
Deji most the time 😐
i’m not seeing how everybody’s saying Alex’s being nice & humble , his arrogance is going completely over you guys heads kuz this dude seems like a self confident dick to me lol
it had to have been mad awkward to be the interviewer
This felt sooooo awkward 😂😂😂😂😂
Deji so annoying I can’t wait for this man to lose three in a row lmao
they low-key flirting
Caption - “2 gown men doesn’t know how to seat on a chair properly”
Deji going n lose
The last two fights I was confident. I'm kinda scared for the third one. And the amount of pressure on deji is unbelievable! He is fighting in his hometown in front of alot of fans, friends and family! His brothers gonna be there and if he loses this fight, its over. But if I'm gonna be honest with You, It doesn't matter how many times you lose. What matters is that you've got the heart to still keep going. You push your self even when others don't see that potential in you. You work hard and eventually you will show the world what you really are.
this is actually such a mature and genuine face off. they're both honest and wont back down
Alex needs to curse more in his channel
Most humble face to face ever but tbh his Alex lose it doesn’t matter because he has nothing to lose
Why this shit so hard to watch lmao 😂😂😂
if i lost to a man that sounds as feminine as alex id end it al
I really don’t care about this
team deji all the way lets gooooooo
I'm team Alex, but I like Deji a lot. If Deji does lose, I  hope he takes it well, but I'm pretty sure he won't. I think Alex is very grounded and will be fine if he loses.
I’m not on no one’s side, but I think Deji will honestly win, because he has more experience. In my opinion the person who has more experience will automatically be better than the one without experience
Deji seems too confident and that is worrying me
why they flirting tho bruh alex out here tryna rizz deji up
I laugh Deji still loses 😂😂💔
betec the gloves are off lol
the level of respect😳😳
I am 3mins in and I think they should just start kissing
2:35 respect
Jesus so chill
Why they being so nice to eachother 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Man made a meme
dude dji thinks so highly of himself , i think highly of myself to but this fool thinks hes the main character to a movie or something . i legit cant take deji serious LOL he looks like he just wants to say the coolest shit possible xD
Deji will get tired again and stopped, there's no way you can improve your cardio this quick, deji will fall lol, if he wins he wins but if wassabi wins, its game over deji lol
Deji asking "do you wanna fight now?" was so CRINGE ffs. I'm on dejis side but my bruddas chat is trash. Deji was trying too hard to be tough here. Wasabi was chilled and himself and respect to that. This was hard to watch.
First Deji said he put the work in but wasn’t Tested enough, then he said he didn’t put the work in… hes chatting bare shit
20:43
Dat nigga tryna fool you deji don’t be nice to dat nigga ofn
I'm from USA but I want deji to win
This is cringe as fuck
Alex trying so hard to make em mad but deji is just chill
Alex is nervous look at 3:06 when you swallow your spit is Bc you nervous and scared
Wasabi going to wipe the floor with Deji
Like two friends tryna softly insult each other
I love both of these youtubers. Honestly my hunch says Alex wins this
This is a podcast tbh
why is this a fight
2 clowns thinking they're the shit
Why is this like couple therapy though?
Come on Deji drop this kid
Wtf is Alex 31😂 he looks 16
Dejis not a fighter he going to loose again.
The way they looking at each other damn gayyyyy
his voice sounds like it never cracked
Alex looked at the mediator scared for his life when Deji asked him to fight right then and there
Tbh I really started to like Alex he is a very nice dude... and the way he loves his family’s just hilarious, he just like every normal person who becomes famous and rich... which is the dream to look after your family I like that dude... of course all respect to deji and I think deji is gonna win... but Alex is a chill dude I wish him the best in life...
This is some sort of Therapy fam
Why they whispering tho😂😂
i like that they respect each other
Alex wassabi my childhood is acting hard 🤦‍♂️ That childish person us now fighting it just doesn't work
Deji makes no sense when he talks about boxing lol
Alex is so chill mannnn but Deji gonna have that Dub 🔥
I was just waiting for them to start making out
Alex finna make deji cry 😂
Dej relax mate u are 0 and 2
This was a conversation amongst friends literally 😂
loki cringe but intruiging
I mean deji didn’t call it face 2 face for nothing
Lets hope deji isn’t this slow in the actual fight..
Bruh Alex is toooooo innocent😂😂😂
He is so focused, glasses off, hooded, deep voiced, no smiling, and no laughing. He’s really focused here. Go on Dej!
Deli ur repping all of the UK for the third time now. THIRD TIME’S THE CHARM. DONT f**k this up
I love how Deji is trying his best to intimidate Alex and Alex is just like “lol whateves let’s be friends 😆” 😂
1:43 someone couldn't hold it in
I was waiting for them to jus start making out bruh
who tf asked for this LMAOOO
If deji don't win I'm dropping out of school
My man Wassabi be looking like if ChrisMD and Nick Digiovani had a baby
Team Alex
This feels like a nice conversation more likely then a egotistical one and it’s really chill and cool
Deji is losing this one.
This is gonna be the worst fight ever 😂😂👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
It’s crazy how nobody wants Alex is win
I'm 3:13 in and i have a question. They know they are meant to fight each other right?
Deji can't trash talk 🤣
Sounds like deji keeps saying “you have no excuses, but I do” 😂😂
Deji has to come in with the naruto sage mode theme
I think deji didnt spar enough like Alex did, so even though I like dej, I think Alex will win.
How tf does deji hate Alex wtf
Deji about to take another L 😂
Deji is actually soo com in dis he isn’t even moving around a lot like Alex
Alex sounds so fake
this was like the most funniest shit ever lol
I love this. They weren’t trying to inflate egos or anything, seems like they genuinely have some respect for eachother x
Wait deji was talking nicely but then he said “so you are just about combinations “ and Alex “well yeah have you not trained combos ?” And deji: I’m here for boxing 🥊… deji boxing isn’t just knockouts
Alex is really chill if he wins i wouldn’t mind
alex wassabi sounds like Peter from don't look up
Kinda hope Alex wins Ngl
This was not a face off this was a date
Thats abit susss
They started having a normal conversation at 3 minutes 😂 I was like “wtf is going on”
I love u deji but u will lose again 😭
Alex is too innocent, you can tell whenever deji tried to roast him he just feels sad for Alex because of the way he reacts
Alex wassabi trying to flirt
Deji doesn't take his eyes off the target
Job interview
These are always so cringe
Deji is being cocky asf…
Im team deji and I really don’t like alex wassabi but this face2face was just 2 nice guys 😂
Cant wait till Alex wins and makes Deji realize his cocky ass aint built for the sport
Alex is nervously easy win for boy DEJII!!!
If deji has put in the work he will win Alex seems hesitant
Let’s go Deji!!!!
Imma just quit being on my social life if deji loses
Already feeling sorry for Alex he such a nice guy
I think deji will lose, it's not that he needed to improve physically. He needed to improve his mind. I hope I'm wrong but it seems deji hasn't grown mentally much since Jake Paul
Alex seems like a cool nice guy but in terms of fighting feel like he’s soft or just not that guy
Why was that wholesome 😂😂😂😂 Alex ain’t made for banter Deji kept trying and he was like nah man I love u 😂
I want deji to win but I can sense that Alex is gonna light him up lool
Sheeesh the softest 😹face2face
"so there's no excuses". One of the coldest most simple lines deji has ever said
Feels more like a therapy session than a face 2 face
There's a "pay per view on Saturday"...  ... There's a stream for me on Saturday
This is dumb awkward
From this I think Alex is a fan boy and he's dream to meet deji has come true
Hope alex doesnt get too excited in the ring. U can lose ur gameplan if u get too hyped.
Alex: "if you lose will you fight again? Deji: : "No, im not fighting again"  Man Alex is so much of a nice guy I bet he'd let him win so he doesn't end this whole man's career. That being said tho, if Alex loses of course I'm not gonna think its because Alex let him win. Deji's clearly put in the work to take the W finally, im just saying Alex is that nice.
This shit feels like they about to kiss or sum
Deji is a bit arrogant here.. The memes would be deadly if he loses...   So wait... Deji switched camps 5 weeks ago while the other guy has been training for 4 months... Wtf????!!
7:34🤣🤣🤣
"sounds like a date to me"
This alex guy wants to get fkd up
They r so nervous even minute u can here them gulping its mad
I like the old deji hes too scary now
Kenny won and Deji lost, sadly. And yes, I traveled back from the future.
“You’ve got no excuses then” was pretty good 6:25
Make us proud dej
26:04 this is going to become a meme when alex loses if deji is actually training
R they friends or something
Letsgoo dejiii
This is the most wholesome face 2 face I’ve seen 🤣💀💀
Cringe
26:15 💀I was finished
I love this. They weren’t trying to inflate egos or anything, seems like they genuinely have some respect for eachother x
Who are these people ?
Wtf deji
wassabi casuallly giving deji motivation and good comments
I just Hope deji had all the Time and Training needed to win this fight I do feel he is at a disadvantage a bit given this training but he does have past experiences to push him forward so will see
swear down if deji loses i’m unfollowing him
TEAM WASSABI
Deji at times shows he is levels above, like wassabi didn’t even know what “knockout power” meant. Like… come on.. both of them at times seemed like they would accept defeat, they think of defeat too much, Deji more near the healthy amount but just that little too much
I hope my boy Alex wins!
the most respectful face 2 face
Who?
DEJI NEEDS TO FIGHT VINNIE HACKER AFTER THIS
I can't hate these dudes anymore, good luck fella's have fun, make some money and just let the hard work show through
Dejis gnna lose in my opinion
They are going to fight
1:46 was that a fart?
Don’t let us down dej 🇬🇧
ah the face to face. best place to make memes after the person loses fight... no pressure deji, but you hve to win and be in shape
you know behind the competititve spirit they sound like 2 chill friends lol
This was more like a date than a face to face
I feel like Alex is lowkey trying to reverse psychology on Deji. Like being nice and not hyping him up enough to be aggressive and actually beat him you know.
i used to watch deji and alex a long time ago i’m in a weird spot cause i used to watch alex when i was small but same with deji i want deji to still win
Alex wassabi sound like a girl ngl
Deji wins this fight in 2. I’d rather him lose though cause that would be incredible funny
I can’t tell if the mean face, neck rolling, and muscle tightening on Alex is anger or anxiety😭
As a UK fan, defi is still cringe especially when he tries to trash talk. Just gets brushed off like nothing from Wassabi. Atleast it's not as painful to watch as the Jake Paul face off he was worse in that
Alex is so cringe man
I want another L for deji lezgooooo
Alex is a joke
That’s cold 🥶 from deji 19:34 😎
Deji really has the experience and advantage here. Two fights, he's gotten used to the feeling. And it's in UK, lots of boos incoming for Alex.  Goodluck to both.
Cringe. Pure cringe
wishing all da best to both, but i think most of the world is rooting for Deji, even Alex Wasabi fans is rooting for Deji.
This is so awkward
Deji I need you to tear this clown’s head off for me   But Alex good luck to you as well
This face 2 face is so cringy
This is the most friendly fire face to face I’ve seen
I grew up with alex and guava but i also like deji maybe tie
They Seem like good friends
I like the respect between these two
Wtf alex is 31 bruh he looks like 18
For the people who say dejis gonna win I ask why? Because he’s slimmer? We shouldn’t believe a single word he tells us. He told us that he trained 6 TIMES A DAY for the vinnie fight. He’s a liar
Dude this was a conversation 😭
Fix that hairline mane
Come on Deji ultimate redemption and we all believe u man
I’m from the US but I’m still voting for UK I don’t like Alex
Yo Who's All For DEJI Here
Alex Wassabi is gonna get knocked out
someone is gonna get knocked out. I hope its not Deji
this was the nicest face to face ever
Worst face off in history of a fight. What a disgrace
They're both actually really calm and chill
Alex totally got in dejis head
So cringey 😂😂 obviously rooting for Deji but wouldn't be surprised if he lost
I’m trying to spread positivity and knowledge to the masses on my channel, let’s help young men be MEN again. Support my journey if you’re interested and offer some value too! I believe everyone has something you can learn from.
The guys face in the middle just cracks me up like what a muppet what is he doing.
Loool i hope they become friends after this fight
It’s so weird to see Alex wasabi be in a face 2 face after knowing him from fouseytubes channel years ago, Deji looking at him like he ready to tear his head off😂😂 this could be a really good fight
respect to wasabi after this
The best part of these events is always seeing the lengths people will go to stream the event
I can't wait to look up who wins instead of paying
That was awkward lmao
I can't imagine being in one of these. It would just be so fkn weird lol.
I hope Deji’s got a cold fade for this fight. Man’s headtop is always a mess😂
It’s basically a date👌🏿
feels like an awkward date more than anything
it looks like they tryna be friends lol
why does Deji sound like batman
this is like a friendly  conversation pretty much
You got to give them this. The humbleness on alex is amazin and deji is alil ahead of himself but he need the confidence boost so much
Hella pause moments
deji needs a trim💀💀💀💀
The fuck is wrong with his neck
team deji
Let's goooo, Deji! You got this fam

deji how dose it feel for u to be doing all the training just to get knocked out in the first round
1:44 deji audibly gulped when he heard Wassabi was training prior. 🦻 I think he's worried.. 😟
I’m surprised Alex is 31 he looks and acts a lot younger

I don’t like Alex or Deji really but I just find it funny how Deji is speaking like he’s so good when he’s lost 2 fights in a row I understand that he put in the work and all that but why is he talking like he’s fucking Mike Tyson 😂

Its gonna be a fixed fight
And. After this Alex and Deji kissed
This is humble and genuine. The type of face off I like
authentic .
Boy this is the fruitiest chillest kindest face off
Notice Alex can’t hold eye contact with deji, and is constantly look everywhere EXCEPT deji…it’s the little things, deji you warlord💪🏽
No way these guys weight less then me
Is this even viewer worthy?
i wish i could have had a chat like this with sansa 😔
This was proper shit
You see them talking about a fight after the video next coryxkenshin flipping pancakes 😂
The man in the middle has to hardest job of making this a must watch when they made it seem like a friendly but let the gloves do the talking
Deji looks like Deebo out of the Friday movies 😂😂
Nice romance
Alex you fucked up the wassabi brand
yo ngl alex is playing it smart, his trying to get in deji's head with the kill him with kindness tactics, so when he fights him he'll underestimate him, which I hope he doesn't do. Nothing but love for the both them, I'm rooting for deji, but I'm curious as to what Alex is gonna do.
This fight will be epic guaranteed 🔥
deji sounds like he is crying when he talks lol
This made me want Deji want to loose.
How many days till the fight again
Pretty Decent and Professional face to face. Reminds me of Parker vs Joshua
This is so wank
Jake a 9🤣
Deji for the big win respect to deji for the hard work😃🔥
A respect face2face
Hopefully deji’s stamina improved as well
These two talking together like they're best friends at a sleepover
I think Alex is gonna win
Scrapped everything I know about deji to avoid any positive bias and I don’t know anything about Alex. Judging both just from this alone, I prefer Alex and reckon he has the edge.
This was a humble face to face.
Jep he will kill Alex
Hope Deji won the fight inside him so he can win all the easy fights outside him from now on!
Get this W Deji. Make the UK proud. Show us you have what it takes. Show us the warrior — the gladiator. Go get that dream. You have to eat the dream. You have to sleep the dream. You have to dream the dream. You gotta touch it, you gotta see it when nobody else sees it. You have to feel it, when it’s not tangible. You have to believe it, when you cannot see it. YOU GOTTA BE POSSESSED WITH THE DREAM!!
Alex looks like he wants to fuck deji, not fight him
Would be great if Deji reminded us the date of the fight.
ive never seen  a more friendlier face 2 face
Whenever Alex was speaking, deji just gives him a death stare
“ Did you want to win your last fight deji?” Nigga what 🤣😂no duh
This was so weird what tf was this they being Friends 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Respectful but this felt a little weird. They're too focused on their own game no mind games haha
14:00 Damn that made it even more intense you shouldn't have to tell us that now i will feel sorry if he loses and feel for deji if he looses as well.
This is unlike any face2face ever. No trash talk. Are you sure this is going to be a boxing match?
please win
I love to see them being so humble to each other and respecting each other And what happened to alex wassabi he seems really REALLY kind and humble
Not trying to hate but why is deji looking homeless 😂😂
I can't lie Wassabi is very likeable
Deji if you lose this im changing my gender...
19:14 your not supposed to KO people in sparing 😂 I bet deji hasn’t even dropped somebody
Oh this is not a American Youtube channel so thats why he is telling his weight in kgs which more understandable to Indians too.
I feel like Alex is too nice for boxing or any combat sport?!
alex is terrified, he’s excited but he’s scared out of his mind.
deji is homosexual
Alex is 31? He acts so much younger
Love them both
How many fucking times did alex crack his back
This is so wholesomeeeeee
This is soooo cringe i love it
The kid on the right cracking his neck every few minutes makes him look uncomfortable as fuck.
Hope Deji wins but if he loses again theres no excuses, This would be the most embarrassing defeat out the 3
why you tring to put on a deep voice hahah
Me and my BFF boxing will look like this 😂
Sounds like their on a date
This whole thing is cringe 😂😂
Alex Wasabi will destroy deji.
size of them lips jesuzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Don’t lose Deji
At this point they’re dating
I hope Wassabi doesnt get knocked out. He’s such a nice guy 😭😭
bruh alex is such a pure soul thats not how face to face should go lol it should be TOXIC as hell but this mf is just idk too nice
imagine if deji lose💀
Bless, Alex has no idea... No kill in him, he is fucked
If he loses this time thats him done fr.
prob another draw
gimme a pillow
Come in its a easy win man . if deji fks this up Plzz just let him perish himself
7:32 Emotional Damage XDDDDDDDDDD
Watch deji get beaten again  in 2 rounds
The pressure on Deji is unbelievable. He has to win this one decisively, because if he doesn't no one will ever take him seriously again. We are looking at a man who's lost his ability to roast in the group chat already. Imagine it, he's trying to run his mouth and all he gets back is Jake Paul + Vinnie + Alex and a gif of him taking a knee. Scandalous behaviour that he can't even defend himself from. Meanwhile if Alex loses, oh well he gets a wave of people telling him good effort, try it again next year etc.
Alex honestly looks extremely anxious in this the bouncing about, the trembles, the feint hesitations in speaking and what I can only see as embellishing or bigging himself up is odd. if he was so confident he wouldn't be doing this.
Going from Colby Vs Masvidal to this, this is like kindergarten shit 😅
Welp if you Don’t know who’s gonna win already. You’re clapped
As much as I love Deji, the middle guy is assisting Deji way too much in this face to face
he sounds so anoying
Alex was like comedy to a boxer how crazy was that
Deji will win by points or the match will end in a tie.
This fight is gonna be 🔥
😂😂😭nahh this is the most soft voice face to face I ever seen so calm and mature
Both got humble that's why this is so chill
Deji chose the easiest yt fight there is aside from fousey
Alex definitely lying out here
he 31? why he act like he straight out of highschool.    Khabib style this dej .  less talk more work.
I only wanna watch this fight to see deji get wrecked
9:30
idk why, but im cringing
why are they sat like that
Alex might seem like the humble nice guy but he’s playing the mind games and manipulating tf out of deji’s thoughts lol
This ain’t a face off😂 Alex is too kind, deji tryna stay tough but eventually it turns into a friendly chat.
This is the most chill face to face ever
U got this Deji!
That Alex guy is not confident at all dude pretending he’s scared lowkey
They just want a bag it’s funny watching em when they grew up but let’s see who wins
Why alex
They kissing each others arse
This is way to humble I don’t like it 😂
Alex is a nice kid lol
👨🏻❓❓❓❌❌💯💯💯🈲🈲 WTF 😳 🐧🐧😬🫑🫑
Cringest shit I've seen they should off just kissed I hope deji loses be fucking hilarious.
Imagine if deji loses 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is this f2f or review about other youtubers
after the fight hear me out Best Friends
Dej you gotta win this
Im sorry to say that but deji is going to lose
Was hard to start dissing each other when it started of respectful
I think deji got this, Alex seems over confident qnd tbh nervous
This is one humble face 2 face - Fair play to both guys. Bring it home Deji!
I'm suprised deji called out Alex Wasabi, that guy can actually box for a youtuber i doubt deji will win this one
"tryna turn each others brain off" never knocked anyone out before in sparring tho, huh
wtf  i thought that was a gay interview
Alex is too good of a guy 😂
Thought the Winter Solider was the host from The Avengers 😂
Deji ain’t the tough guy kind, but alex is on another level of wimpiness. Alex on a fighting sport is so cringey. He’s only meant to be for kids shows
This looks like a date
“I haven’t really though about Alex” what a fknnn savage
Lol when deji smashes him wassabi will become a meme
this was awkward to watch
Alex kept moving his eyes compared to deji, usually sign of nervousness. He took of his jacket to try to look tougher, talking to much with stutter and over talking definitely feel the nerves from his body language
The trouble I see is Alex likely soft talked Deji to take his edge off. Not saying it will happen, but it is a bit worrying. I feel like if he pulls him into a "friendly chat", Deji may find it harder to throw those hard punches when he's tired again
This fight will not be good 😒
All I got to say is… man like fucking DEJI.
" alot of people are underestimating me" no shit deji u get your shit rocked on a regular basis
Goodluck to the both of you guys!
What a horrible face to face, respect to both fighters on the night tho
Team Alex 🙌
i was just waiting for them to kiss
Cringe
im actually gonna buy this i never actually but this shit will be mad interesting
Even deji’s voice got deeper! Turning into a man
Deji gonna win
Don’t take another Edible  And if you lose don’t say that’s why you lost
this is nice
Come in deji
Alex seems like he knows more than deji
lowkey seems like a fan fiction
Alex is so chill.
Shoulda titled this ASMR face2face
The amount of times deji licked his lips makes me want Alex to drop him 🤣
I want Alex wassapi to win couse he looks pretty nice
Why does wassabi act and talk like a Mormon😂
Deji just sitting there like 😐
They are sweethearts
combo punches 😂 mans been training on wii sports boxing 💀
*Deji kind of pissed me off tbh and I was rooting for him.* Everything he said about Wasabi could be said about himself. “You’re acting like a big shot [because he’s sparring good guys].” Yet, Deji is bragging about his sparring knockouts against guys that aren’t as good. Deji saying Wasabi never boxed and doesn’t know the pressure yet saying he has no excuses. Deji has been full of excuses. He has ZERO right to talk when he’s never backed up his talk and got finished TWICE.
Respect to Deji. Alex is hard to be heated with but Deji clearly drained his confidence over the time of this face to face. New Deji let’s see you lad, we’ve all got your back!
No one here knows how to sell a fight
Delji looks ready for war🥷🏻
lmao deji trying mad hard to get in alex head but failing
No gay shiit but Alex is good looking
If deji lose this fight he will go back to Dunjahh
Deji knock him the f out
am i the only one who wants alex to win just for the meme dont get me wrong im a fan of deji
They look like they are on a date getting to know each other loool
Not gunna lie Alex was so nice and deji had a rude ass vibe about him
I think they will start making love i a minute
im rooting for u deji but alex is so sweet omg
*I don’t like how Deji keeps saying “you have no excuses.”* Deji, YOU have no excuses. Yes, Wasabi has the height and reach, but Deji as he said has more experience and has fought twice.
is that sebastian stan?
Just a casual chat tbh
*I like Deji but I like that Wasabi played Deji at his own game.* He proved Deji saw him as an easier opponent which shows his lack of confidence. Deji stepped down from Jake to Vinnie and then Wasabi. Deji has no excuses anymore.
*Yes, Vinnie had cardio but he’s also ONLY 18 years old. Deji is like 26 and is in his physical prime.* You naturally get a lot stronger around 25-27 without trying. He had a significant advantage over Vinnie.
Wow wtf I’ve never seen a peaceful face to face moment respect for both men
Flanges
deji: i’m gonna just go thru u. i’m gonna break you. i’m gonna eat u alive.   alex: 😁😁😁😃😃😃😃😊😊😊
Love to see Alex trying to rip Deji with questions and he responds flat and outright. Camps done him right.
20:50 nahhhh deji is jokes😂😂😂😂the man wants a knockout at the face to face
they gonna be best friends fr
Deji called Alex's bluff when he ask to fight him there, that's badass
Wasabi is just a chill guy.
Idk why it’s reminds me of my first date
lol its like a reunion between friends
Deji is salty for no reason lol
I just love how deji without glasses honestly goes with his boxer look
Ayo wtf am I watching 😂
Why is this so awkward
Alex got that Michael Jackson voice
Literally became best friends
I was not expecting this lol
i don't trust alexander to me he's still a scumbag no matter how nice or trusty he is (again it's nothing to do with hating its hard to trust someone)
I feel like Deji was trynna act like jake during this face 2 face
This is boring now. What the fuck does it matter who wins. They’d gain more views just running up on each other actually laughable 12 year old amateurs would do these two
Deji why you gotta do double adds
One of the most kind and respecting face to face
This is the nicest face to face I’ve ever seen🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣wth
what a cringe fest.
I like this
YEEEEEEAAAAH UP THE DEJIIII
Alex is 31
We love u deji ❤️❤️❤️
Someone plug me up with some tickets please!
this is how i talk to my girlfriend after a fight
Lmaoo Deji tryna act tough but alex keeps giving him kindness
Lol the alex guy seems like a extremely nice guy 💀😂😂😂
Deji gang deji fuck Alex up ❤️
Alex tried to be nice to him, but after that deji try to poke him hahahahahha
let's go mr.mcdonald 🤣🤣🤣
THERE NEEDS TO BE A LIL BORED VIDEO OF THIS
Why did parts of this low-key feel like a podcast host interviewing a guest when they spoke to one another? Good luck for Saturday
Nigga that got knocked out by fousey 🤣🤣🤣
DEJI has more power but I think DEJI gonna gas out again Alex gonna have more stamina
“Lack of confidence and underestimating me”  Deji how tf does that make sense
Are they gonna fight or kiss?
God these two are so dead zero conversation skills
This was easily one of the most chill. Face offs 🤣
Finally subscribed 🇵🇬🇵🇬
Alex Wassabi seems like a douchebags name, but IRL he seems to be a nice and chill person
I need deji to beat the breaks off this guy💪🏾 but let’s get a win 🥇
I am really excited
Deji seems more focused
I'm from the UK but I want Alex to win lol.
No disrespect but had to look up who Alex wassabi is
THEYRE LITERALLY HAVING A NICER CONVERSATION THAN ME AND MY FRIEND DO😂
Calling it right now they still gonna look like wet lemons in a ring
This ain’t no face 2 face this a Mf conversation
Lmfao may the best man win
Even if this goes to points a deji wins I would still be disappointed and think he should stop boxing. He has to knock him out to prove himself
alex wassabi is a bum
Ngl I like Alex's vibe
Deji is just about to lose again unless he paid off Alex.  He fcking sucks don't buy the fight smh
deji is a clown bruh
This shits way tooo humble and chilled gtfo
This is the least entertaining face to face I’ve ever seen
I hope I'm wrong but I have a feeling Deji could loose.
Teddy bear fight 🧸
I don't watch Alex care for him anything. But say if deji loses its nice to see Alex pushing him to say you've done the work now. You may have more work to do. But you're here now. Just saying respect Alex
I like the respect of the boxers giving each other
So ur just learning combos? Umm ya aren’t u no I’m learning to box makes sense
is it just me or alex is only seen know because of this fight
What are you learning  “I’m learning to box” LMMAAAOOO
Alex is actually pretty nice? I thought he would be a douchebag but damn, my view on him changed
this mf talking dseriosu
dont like wassabi but i see him winning
deji and alex just become best friends and they mature after the fight lmao
I want deji to win, but I have a feeling Alex is gonna win. Deji wants to trash talk so bad but Alex ain't falling for it lol I want deji to stay humble but he's failed that part. Looks like Alex is gonna win
Deji fuck is you doing comeback going to be strong ?
Hahah Alex looks like he wants to shah deji
I like both but I grow up watching Alex so I think Alex will win
At first I was gonna say Deji but alex is such an og for me like I grew up with him. Idk if he has what it takes but idk I think it’ll be good
I’d t bag both of them
deji looks like hes going to kill this man bruh
The sexual tension is real
Cringe
This was the most dead face to face on boxing
Honestly this face to face was so wholesome lmfaoo
Deji says he wont underestimate his opponent anymore but keep saying alex aint ready and dont have what it takes
They sound like they’re trying to seduce each other.
I’m not going to lie. I wouldn’t care who wins this fight.  Both look amazing and humbled
You’ll lose ,end of the line.
I never hated alex I just didn’t watch his videos…but let’s go deji!!!!!!!!’
why does alex look like Lando Norris
This was so respectful 🤣🤣🤣
Are they friends?
EVEN THE FACE TO FACE WITH FAZE TEMPER AND KENNY WAS MORE AGGRESSIVE THIS FACE TO FACE WAS SO FRIENDLY
They both tryna pick at each other without being the "bad guy", this is actually weirdly interesting to watch
Deji gonna kick his ass. I always believed in Deji no matter the losses I have no doubt in my mind that Deji gonna knock this skimpy bitch out
This legit sounds like they are on their first date ...
I feel like Alex is so polite and respectful, but deji WANTS him to not be so he can trash talk. Lol
I wish there was a heartbeat monitor attached to these guys to get an idea of what they’re actually feeling
Yo Deji you better not loose 😤
his head is so square
These wannabe boxers are pure comedy
🤡🤡🤡
Deji winning this fuck dat
Alex sounds mad gayyy idc Lmaooool
wow you suck at talking Deji. both of you are a complete joke. these guys went from silly youtubers to now tough guy boxers give me a break.. 2 rounds Deji is done
Alex Wassabi is so nice, lol.
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon
Matthew 3:2
I can’t wait to see Richard to beat deji
I am team jide
Hear me out, Deji have gotten 2 chance to take the dub and didn’t and now I want Alex to win this for some reason.
You better win
Deji looks so tired
No. Alex doesn’t want to fight. He just wants attention. He reminds me of fousey
Deji please win
lmao it's so weird to see such a friendly face 2 face, it seems like an awkward convo you have with that one family member you aren't on good terms with
Diji givin me da demon time energy
are they just man flirting with each other? lol
ASMR
i love both i don’t know who to go for😂
Nah Deji was ready to go blazing but he realised Alex was a bit more chill
God bless everyone. Give your life unto Jesus follow God
As an American No one likes Alex wasabi he ain’t no Team USA
Alex said he has no excuses but through out the interview he said the spotlight/pressure could be a factor and Deji says he doesn’t underestimate Alex but seeks knowledge throughout the convo in hopes to find reasons Alex wasn’t training at his level and hoping Alex is capping his confidence but it’s better to expect the best
Both lookin great, hope deji gonna slam him down tho
idk what it is about alex, but he gives me the ick🤣🤣🤣 i can’t stand the way he says shit it’s so cringe🤣
i dont know what to think anymore...
alex reminds me so much of ben askren 🤣
I wonder what roy thinks of this
Rip bucket head nation 🙏
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Look its Jake Paul's son
They both to humble😭
Did he just say he’s 31😭😭😭😭
bruh where did all the thrash talk go ? Vacation?
Jarvis is jealous
Deji be lookin at Alex like he's a meal 🤣
Respect both of these men 🙌
Deji man your amazing
Wassabis acting like a fan
Wassabi definitely doesn't have knockout power, you can tell just by the way he answered the question. Let alone after seeing him hit pads. idk how this fight will go, it's really hard to tell but I'll be tuning in for sure I'm excited to see how Saturday night goes.
I could meditate to this
Respect to both Deji and Alex tho, they both are good dudes ✊🏾❤️
Borringgggggg~
host: so what do you think of alex deji: i think he lacks confidence alex: so whyd u choose to fight me? deji: because he lacks confidence LOL
Alex smiling at Deji , js feel like he a villain in this story , ends Deji’s boxing career (TEAM DEJI)
Deji for the win🔥🔥🔥
Yeah deji lost, after the question alex asked him. "Will you fight again if you loose?" He answered "no" that's saying somenthing 😂
Most humble face 2 face lmao😂😂 I got Alex winning by tko. Deji looks good and all but he was exactly the same with Jake and Vinnie. I might be underestimating Deji but until then I can’t root for him since he hasn’t done anything. So I’m rooting for Alex by tko. If it goes the other way then props to Deji for proving me wrong
Alex seems pretty Chill,  he aint giving me douchey vibes lol. Why dont the Olatunjis like him?
I don’t watch or really care about Alex only knew about from when fousy tube was a thing but I actually love how respectful and humble he was to what Deji has done to try to prove him self this time around
If Deji doesn’t win he has to stop 🛑
I feel like deji is purposely covering up his body, so when the weigh comes around he can shock everybody
Alex wasabi was basically a therapist. 😂
Anybody know when the weigh in is?
They have mad respect for each other I’m happy for them both, big up lads! 💪🏼
Deji please knock him out this is your time
alex scared ggs
these guys seem like they could easily be good friends if they didnt have to punch each other in the face in a few days
why is sebastian stan in the middle
Deji kept trying to act like the villain here, should've just let yourself spoke normally.
deji wins. thought alex had it tbh until this
This is DEJI
That dude does not look 31
That shit's asmr
This is the nicest face 2 face I have ever seen
Deji is a savage
Not a body language expert in any way, but even a blind bat could tell who is feeling the nerves out of these two.
deji is a very different beast than he was. his entire demeanor has so more depth than before
Seacrest out
don’t like the guy but alex seems very composed could be a problem for deji
Dude I can’t decide who I want winning both of these guys I grew up watching
if deji loses, he needs to quit boxing for good and possibly even youtube because he's been all bark no bite for the past two events
Deji deep voice is always a vibe!
Yall clowns if yall think deji gonna win…alexs been training for like a year now nonstop
Deji be so calm and weird, he on another lvl guys
Just my opinion here and what I perceived, Deji looks and sounds like he plans on winning, and is treating it like business, Alex seems content to be there, and is just hoping for a good fight regardless of the winner.
Alex is low key being super cocky
OGUS TWENY FIF
Alex just has that face you wanna punch
This is great. Super nice on both sides. Hope both r safe on fight night
What the f**k is this. Looks like they are going through some mediation 🤦. Why don't you guys just kiss in the ring.
Deji looks focused and calm
Corny nonsense for 12yr old to watch. 2mins of this cringe was enough. None of them can fight
Deji you better win or your career is done out
Alex: Coincidence that you switched camps after my strength and conditioning video.  Deji: I don't watch your videos. Idk Alex: Oh.. (let me switch the subject)  nobody watches my videos.. lol
I love how they were talking shit with quit voices😭
Man.. Deji.. I don't know
alex a lil b
I Like both guys, Alex honestly just seems like a fan tbh must be wild for him
Don't think deji can afford taking on a "badass" role here he'd be much better off just showing genuine character but...whatever
im hoping alex wins as he is a nice dude and he has created a childhood for me and many others
Experienced deji gon be fire🔥🔥
🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤌🏽
Here comes the body language coaches in the comments section, dissecting each muscle twitch and contractions.
When Alex said he’s 31😮😮😮😮😮 aslo go deji
Why dose this feel like a asmr video when they talk
This has to be the most chill face 2 face I’ve ever seen indeed
Damn I Wish Alex Would Have Pissed Him Off. Deji Might Bust Out Laughing In This Fight
Looking 👌
Legit i just said a prayer in an african voice asking god to allow deji to easily beat this stupid  idiot and i also asked him if alex could just be a small stepping stone to the start of deji's boxing career
I got Deji for this fight..Alex is a pretty boy. Deji has had his ass kicked multiple times and knows what to expect. He's also got a lot more to prove. Alex is only here because he thinks he can make a quick buck.
Deji is so passively aggressive
Mf is like friends talking 😂😂😂
joke
I honestly don’t Alex is trying to get Relevance
Deji: im gonna go right through you im gonna eat you   Alex: 😁
lol the more intense deji got the more hyped alex got
If Deji loses he should face slim or Adam. Same for Alex. If he loses he should face slim
U finna get fucked up,😂😂😂 u lost to Vinnie hacker
Alex seems genuine and i dnt watch his videos or anything but man...he juss sounds like an ass lmaoo
2 feminist dudes 😂😂
I like Deji BUT I'm American so I gotta go with Alex. I cheer for my home teams. Go Alex!!
Ngl. Deji is silent…. Means he’s gonna be going full TRYHARD mode
Damn
we all know deji gonna win, Deji been putting in the work.
Wasabis a dark horse deji will lose again
Deji doesn’t seem very confident
LOL it's impossible to play the bad guy against Alex. He's too nice LOL. I'm shocked they didn't hug and cry on each other's shoulders
deji is the only fucking person I know in this whole event
why they so nice I did not expect this.
I’m happy that both of them already and they’re giving straight direct answers
theyre just having a casual conversation about life and the middle guy is getting third wheeled hard lol
Obviously I’m team Deji all the way.. but I now atleast respect Alex, he seems genuine and appears to have really put the work in
worst fight lol
Damn 40 pounds Dej? my god he has “trained”
Alex wa smiley ahh fuck boaaa😂😂😂
Kinda sus from wasabi
I don't know who's gonna buy this shit, please guys don't waste money
Damn My 2 Favorite YouTubers Gonna Box Damn
This isn't a Face off it's a Meet and Greet
after you get through wassabi, i say rematch jake paul and be the one to take him tf down les GOOOOOO
Bare funny when Alex went I’ve been hit so hard and rolled his eyes sus guy
Honestly, this was such a good fucking face-to-face Both of them aren't even trying to be better than the other, both being honest and genuine. Fucking love this All the best to both of them
Damn if Deji gets the W. And further pursues his boxing career, Jake might have some unfinished business
Jesus Deji, you're making me nervous with that 26 min glare of yours 😂
Who else was shocked finding out how old Alex is?
Can’t believe they finally collabed
This sounds like 2 friends talking that havnt seen eachother in 6 months
Auogus twenny fif
Deji “I just wanna fight you for no reason”😂😂
Deji: ‘I don’t think you have….’ Alex: ‘What? Prepared?’ Deji: *Yeah* 😑  ooooooo🔥 Deji with than cold attitude🥶
Talking like friends ‼️
After watching a bit more I think it will be a brawl, potentially a draw, but I have a little thought that Deji may potentially be not as good as people think, he has such a high standard coming to this fight so we’ll see what he brings on the table.
Alex definitely needs a massage to stop cracking his bones
Lol, they too soft for this. 😂
Ussually face to faces are like swearing a fight about to happen and raising their voices but this 1 was like they're being nice to eachother
Why do I feel like wassabi gonna get hit with one hook and his demeanour gonna change
Let’s be honest, Alex wasabi hit nothing to lose, the only person with a lot of pressure is deji
I’m here to predict that Deji will win with a late knockout, this may be very inaccurate, but I have a image in my head on how it will go.
Wassabi is gonna ko deji. TOOOO EZZZZ
Deji don't let him get to your head
Alex seems like he has a crush on deji💀
At one point in the video it just looks like 2 friends catching up lol
This shit made me have some respect for Alex
Fuk these niggas so nice for😭 there aint gon be no passion at the fight
MAN! i cant even handle the voice of this gay wassabi.. his voice makes me wanna leave the video.
Even when he tries to be tough He's 🗑. Alex it don't matter what you do. You are the person who got knocked out by Fousey.
Dejo won this one ngl
Dejis giving me ultimate gohan vibes
i just started watching and alex is shitting himself full stop
Honestly I love the aspect of this, where every other fights have been a lot of shit talk, but here is genuinely a lot of respect for one another and maybe not now, but maybe later but I feel like you guys can be great friends after no cap!
If Deji loses, I don't want to see him leave boxing but keep learning and training to win
The most chill face 2 face I’ve seen
Alex has such a punishable face
next thing u know they’ll be best friends and make a sports drink
Man telling him his strategy
I hope alex beats the breaks off this guy
I feel like Alex is secretly a fan of Deji 🤣
He can’t give Bonnie a 3 when vinnue destroyed him
This is the most mature face 2 face I think I’ll ever see
NDL
I think this is the best face to face so far 💯
But you cant say this wasnt the most humble face to face ...they kept it respectful and actually talked to one another without with out the weirdo shit
Alex looks a bit shook he’s not prepared
Fuck I hope deji fixes that man’s voice sounds like he’s had a sore throat his whole life
truth: alex is the nicest person in boxing
yo this shit is comical lol
I hope that when Alex loose this fight he is still like respectable, kind and dosent have any excuses.
I’m gonna laugh so hard if Deji loses again 😂
Laughing at alex wassabi v3       coming soon ..
Wack. I wanna see some static not this care bear shit you guys are gonna beat the hell out of each other. Fuck him up deji REDEMPTION CALLING YOU
Dejis spiritual pressure is crazy in this video
If Deji looses this time imma shave my hair off
This shit makes me think this is about to be a joke
this is not a face 2face, this is a sit down and chill, let's have a good time talking lmaoooo
Deji we love you and I think you have w in the bag but plz dont underestimate him you put in the work and its time to show what you can do
Man this guy is just smiling through the entire interview 😂
If I'm gonna be honest, this is the first time where I've heard Alex swear
This was nice
Let’s Goooo Dejiii👌👌
U can see the fear in Alexs eyes plus u can see deji maintain the eye contact with Alex evan when talking to the other guy.bring the W home dej do it for team UK 💪🇬🇧
Simps
i cant tell if this wholesome or just super awkward for them
Alex Was My Childhood. Deji Was My Childhood. I Don't Know At This Point
Deji lost 40 pounds Alex better pray nothing lands 😭
Yo I’ve only watched 4min of this and it’s already weird😂 Alex is so passive agressive it’s like he’s trying to be mean but can’t Alex is going to get slapped by deji go kill him tigers
21:55 AYOOOO💀
even tho im from the usa im team uk deji gotta win!!!!!
Rooting for deji. Don't let us down now pls
This was sooooo chilll tbh I now have somewhat a kind of respect for Alex
I want deji to win soooooo bad against this weirdo but wassabi cardio is outstanding and above prepared
alternative title: African vs Filipino - FACE 2 FACE
2 youtbers putting on a good face to face that wasn't hard to watch. They actually are ready to fight and are taking this serious respect to them both.
wow, they actually just had a civiled conversation in like the first 3 1/2 minutes
I didn't realise how nice and humble Alex is
Who’s gulping so much?
anyone know what size gloves they are using?
we believe in you deji!!!
Rooting for Deji to win but respect to Alex
alex winning that😂
Alex has too much of a good heart
Im from the U.S. but definitely not rooting for team USA. GO TANK.
this was so close to being a kiss to kiss lmao
alex sounds like Michael jackson lol
To be fair tho you can’t have a serious conversation with a clown. Unless you punch a clown in his face, he gone keep smiling his time away. So I think deji did well presenting himself and showing us his murderous intention, shows us he’s good sportsmanship too and that he’s not being cocky and he’s not thinking about the money and acting cocky to try get more pay per views. Shows us he doesn’t give a shit about anything other than proving himself
they respect each other
Yo this shit felt mad gayy!!!!
Alex so humble man
Alex just made me mad for no reason 😂
What's a rubbish face 2 face
Whole time Deji looks in Alex’s eyes and Alex keeps looking in curcles
you got this deji! bring this win home!
this is the most surprisingly respectful face off I've ever seen in combat sport XD
They come to make joke not fight 😆
Fuck me. This is the most smiley face 2 face I’ve seen if Deji loses this he’s lost a follower 4life and ima laugh till I die
😂what is this
Y’all see how nervous Alex was when Deji asked if he wanted to fight right then and there 😂
this shit so random
I like Alex as a person he’s always like that but I’m ready for deji to win
Its hard to watch
ASMR face off
Alex has been sorta training in boxing for years and got beat by a kid that learned how to box for a couple weeks. That’s why he was not on the undercard for the Austin and Bryce fight. I’m very confident in Deji beating him.
Alex will win
This feels more like a catch up date than a face to face ngl
that was the most chilled face to face ever lol
Demi looks so damn focused ngl kinda scary
Yo cant even lie Alex got some nice teeth lmao
Deji is gonna win I already know it 💯
Deji need to go in mc Donald 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
I think it's fake but were see....
If that dude moves his head around 1 more time...
Alex came into this thinking he playing god damn 20 questions
Holy shit dejis demeanor is crazy
JAKE PAULS SON #1
Alex as he said has been apparently training hard for 4months as deji 6 weeks shouldn't Alex have the confidence to be able to say no ima dominate deji but he doesn't he says it will be a battle truly Alex doesn't know what he is capable of with is bad yeah he could be capable of winning and beating dejis ass but if u don't know what your capable of u may not know if your capable of enough to beat deji I guarantee Alex is not in the right spot to win being that simple fact that he proved he don't know what he is capable of because of the so called switching sparring partners come on Alex each time u spar u should know after words what u are capable of and what u need to work on
There was more hostility between me and my mother when I woke up this morning wtf
Deji over confident again🥶
Yessir deji 💯💯💯
WASABI GONNA WIN 😆
3rd times the charm deji
sending bad energy dejis wayl
Yo dej please redeem yourself
They just had a conversation 😂😂
What a miracle, Deji not running his mouth, very confident.
Deji loses again. The pressure and cardio issues will happen again.
the mental toughness is surreal. Really hard to see who won this face 2 face so game on!!!
ALEX IS 31?!?!?!?!??
Nostalgia really keeps me from hating on Alex
What a calm face to face, Deji lookin confident I know he got this
imaging deji loosing his 3rd fight again lmao
Come on Deji. Let’s get it 💪💪💪
Passive aggressive press conference
alex tryin be nice and deji downplayin everything is hilarious
Only thing missing dinner table with roses ffs 🤦🏻‍♂️
Watching this I have respect for Alex the fact he kept cool didn’t loose his temper from what it seems like is telling the truth and just being honest although he does seem nervous because of the multiple neck stretches but mad respect to the both of them.
Deji - still childish & disrespectful  NOTHING HAS CHANGED....
Why is this so polite
They're both so nice to each other looooooool
deji fs lacking confidence
whos promoting this? lol first I've heard of it
This is like the most chill face to face I've seen. Two people who respect the dedication of the other, and just want to test out their strength in the ring.
No ffs alex tryna act nice so that Deji would be too nice to fight correctly
Alex was the most humble person ever
Deji fighting on my birthday he better win for mn
I feel like deji will win. I can just feel it
im npot convinced by alex. i feel like hes going to shock the world.
Get this W dej
do it for yourself deji dont care about nothing he got to say
they didnt seem tobe trying to scare each other - seems like they are jsut having a conversation
Why isn’t alex being a twat it’s bothering me
alex acc sweet af
Deji cold asl, they ask what version u see what will happen on saturday. Alex explained his part, Deji just said: *DESTROY ALEX*
I love Deji but he was so cringe in this
They are so chill... LOL
Love how all the hate and trash talk was nowhere to be seen here 🤣
On my life deji is winning
To me, Deji seems so much more comfortable this time around, he seemed to have a lot of nervous energy in the jake Paul face to face, this time to me Alex seems like the nervous one
Alex has the right attitude. Deji has the right mind set.
Why Deji look cross eyed
Deji looks like he’s ready to kill I like this
I've been backing deji for years but kinda want Alex to win, he's so humbling and deji is start to come across as big headed, and not respecting Alex ability, didn't really know Alex before this but definitely earned my respect, and dunno if I like this side of deji
It was no drama at all I like it
ngl, i used to watch alex wasabi a lot im on both sides
Alex is ultra soft.....soundin like he watches musicals while wearing a snuggie.......you can't lose to another man who sounds like that.......cmon Deji, we rootin for the comeback tour............
i love how alex was talking smmmm shittt and when he was seated right infront of deji all the shit talk went away LMAOOO
respect
Wait… Alex is 31?!
Cringe asfffff lol
ngl wholesome
This is so gutting cause I’ve been an Alex fan forever and Ima big fan of Deji but I hope Deji wins cause he needs the redemption. Man Alex seems like such a good guy
Pube
this guy essentially asked the same question in differnet formations about 15 times
Just because Deji looks calm doesn't mean this dude hasn't given piss poor effort in his last two training sessions for his last two fights. He has something to prove and if he wants any respect he needs to obliterate this pretty boy and quickly move on to the next. He better show up
I love this
Hope deji loses for being cocky loool
damn deji is cold blooded in this. alex is too soft man
i could fall asleep to this feel like im watching asmr
I have a feeling that this might be the best fight in the history of YouTube boxing
Please go through this man deji
Deji 3rd time is the charm you got the UK support
Alex is so humble and kind. I can’t picture this guy fighting but I’m excited to watch the both of them.
40 pound drop guys he did it. if he was lying the fight would be called off after weigh-in so he must be telling the truth.
deji never took eyes off alex that shows he is ready
Alex wasabi is genuinely a nice guy. Well from this video anyway
1 2 3 punch!
W plz win
😂😂😂
Aye dejis bringing back the views
This is a new man i swear u changed alot  Win or lose love deji
Good conversation between good friends
the amount of pain and lost deji has had..u can see it from the way hes looking at alex
The only calmest face to face I only think it’s because alex because he doesn’t really talk shit
This worries me, if Deji loses, he's done and dusted when it comes to boxing.
Alex’s smile is so contagious it pisses me off
I barely know Wassabi but he seems like a nice dude. Still want deji to win tho 😎
I wish deji wore something actually nice he would look so dope in a shirt and suite pants or summin no homo 🤣😭
Nicely Nice. Alex gonna get it. This new coach has stepped Deji up. 🍿🔜
An interview without Deji laughing, wow.
this like a podcast😂
Do you have knockout power? *Vinnie Hacker unfazed eating haymaker after haymaker*
Face to Faces are always so awkward😂
Lets go Deji W !
U got this Deji.
Alex aint even looking at deji,, then there's deji 👁👄👁
This was so passive aggressive 💀
I feel like deji is going to go for the knockout while Alex is going to try and fight the distance and win by points.
They  are just bffs i guess
As cringe as Alex’s videos are, he seems like a great person tbh
This is fucking boring… Sell the fight
DEJI IS GOIN TO SLAM EM!!!
friendliest face off ever
Alex 😄 Deji😑
deji’s got the eye of the tiger
New Title: Deji and Alex Wassabi kiss each others asses
Sorry boiz but ill wipe the floor with alex
Lmao reading someone lol u lost to a tiktoker shut up
Is this a face 2 face or a romantic, flirty date?
Deji you got this man
25:21 Deji says Alex is doing it to stay relevant when Deji called him out, Deji ur channel is only somewhat alive due to boxing
Dej seems way more confident, Alex looks like he’s  playing the part, stretching his arms and neck. I’m American, but a boxing fan I have Dej knocking Alex out inside 3 rounds.
please Deji win
Crazy to see how humbled deji has become
The fact that Deji is Soo calm is honestly shocking one of the most chill face 2 face ever
this is the best thing deji coulve done  stay on the GRIND DEJI
A mean Alex is just being nice and deji wants to fire it up😂
Alex voice sounds weak just his tone
Deji has been getting punched in the face literally dudes eye is swollen
wow
How many times did Alex break his own neck? He nervous 😅
My boi Dej looking focused
much respect for both of them honestly.
if Deji looses again im gonna cry and laugh at the same time
What time is the fight EST?
Did they hug and kiss after the cameras cut
Why does it feel like they wanna kiss 😂
i fkn hate alex face so much it’s kinda religious
Does Alex look 31 he looks so young
i think they might be friends after this tbh 😭
Alex is just happy to get the bag, he  seems to be a relaxed guy with not much of a real ego and he’s having to perform I very confident he won’t win.
I rate Alex bros humble
Should’ve just made out if y’all were being this nice.
The self confidence comment from Deni shut up alex
Boxing made his balls drop...u can tell Deji is ready for war
have so much faith okay? <3
DEJI
they were both my childhood, rooting for Deji 🔥
Yo was this them having a chill talk like IDK even know any more
Deji looks calm and I love it
cringe af fake ass boxers
This version of Deji was intimidating, he was bogging Alex properly, my man was keeping the answers short and calm, and he didn't smile it was straight face, this guy is gonna murder Alex periodt
Lol most humble face2face I’ve seen
i thought they were gonna makeout
Honestly respect to them both for being humble and not being arrogant - occasional trash talk but the mutual respect is extremely impressive.
More like a heart to heart than a face to face I cant lie
I noticed that Deji stared into Wassabis eyes the whole time and Wassabi looked around, to the interviewer, and into deji’s eyes for a little here and there. Nervous smiling as well. I think Deji take this one.
Wtf is this shit lol it’s crazy that nobody cares about the actual pro boxers yet this shit gets 1 million views?!?
i honestly think alex has verry little chance. not to hate really. i just think i have a pretty good eye about who is going to win, and i don't see him winning. wich makes me kind of sad because he did put a lot lot of work in,  just chose little too good of an opponent for his first ffight, wixh makes me think he will never box again. the ànly thing that can mess deji up now is his foot work, wich is very odd his foot worlk
Lmaoo them starting off as soon as deji said you lack confidence in that demeanor  I started dying 😭🤣
Body language of Deji tells me that he will win
I’m definitely on Dejis side but idk Alex seems a lot more confident whereas deji tries to “trash talk” and it seems like an act to hide emotions
this looks like a date
This looks like a face 2 face for a Beyblade tournament
this sounds like a date
This seems so chill. I rate both Deji and Alex but im rooting for Deji to win this!
i love how they look like just 2 friends talking
Jesus Jake Paul was brought up.😂😂😂
I think if wasabi was more aggressive and less a kiss as then deji would have gone off. I dont think deji can't be mean to someone who isn't mean him first.
im hoping that deji pulls it off
CEOs of “I don’t know”
deji is playin with 200iq he is getting all the information he needs on alex so he knows how to fight him😂
Damn Deji I can tell how nervous you were making Alex in this face to face. Judging by his body language, his eye movements and his overall energy. You were cutting his ego up and you were maintaining eye contact with him and the interviewer.  Alex kept looking all over for answers, someone who is confident in themselves doesn't lose eye contact. He is completely underestimating you, he was not expecting you to be able to stand your ground in a calm manner here. Deji no matter what we all support you, but remember that you are your greatest competition. You can easily beat him, just stay out of your head. If you get a negative thought, speak three positive ones after.
20:42
Alex got this ! His taking it to the late rounds
I like how deji is just calm and not biting to his bullshit
This is how face to faces should be
This is bear wkward
Tell me you have ADHD without telling me you have ADHD.   Alex: *the whole video. 🤣
he’s gonna look really dumb after talking all that shit about Alex
Wait why is this face off so chill and kind, lmao🤣🤣🤣
August 25th... I can't wait
Y’all are forgetting that Alex got knocked down by fousey
deji looks like he's trying to hard to hate mr. wassabi, I kinda hope Alex wins now
no hate to Alex but i just want a Deji to win this
This was wholesome tf😂😂😂
I think Alex is low key scared
I hate to say it because I want Alex to lose, however, with how Deji is answering and his demeanor, he will lose come March 5.
Anyone know what time press conference is
Deji don't do it again when you say your gonna win because what if you lose
Is this a date !!
I find Alex cringe but what he said at the start was hella respectful
"Do you wanna fight now" "Let me leave first you can do what you like" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm going for 🇬🇧
What the actual fuck is going on where is the screaming at
Deji fell right into Alex’s trap he softened him up before the fight this is going to be another loss from deji I’m afraid
Best face 2 face press conference I’ve ever seen they are respectful too each other and so chill hat’s off to the both of you
Deji will loose again, screenshot this comment!
Man why could I see them as friends
Seeing Deji makes me remember Gohan during Dragon Ball Super ToP saga
deji just doesnt give a shit hahaha
Bruh if Alex doesn’t stop moving his neck imma start throwing hands
It’s going to be the funniest shit if Alex wins 😂 prob not but imagine
This was a good face 2 face
This is just awkward 💀
Embarrassing got a failed YouTuber and who ever the other guy is leave boxing alone.
Alex thought this was a speed date bruh😂
deji gets knocked out in 2 rounds
Deji will have his revenge against jake paul in the next 2 or 3 years mark my words
Holy shit, Alex is 31? He looks 20.
Deji is gonna win. No doubt in my mind.
Basically ASMR trashtalking
Respect to these two
Bruh this has gotta be the weirdest face 2 face I’ve ever seen
It was kinda cringe and hard to watch
Deji needs more time to definatly win
Boring af I ain’t paying for this shit tf
Deji talking hard  yess all day 😂😅🤣
Deji means business here never seen him look so serous haha
This shot was boring as fuck
deji needs glasses
Low key first date vibes
Notice how deji just looks right in the eyes of alex most of the time. Alex looks uncomfortable, changing his pose and taking of clothes, looking at the ceiling, using his arms to explain. Deji won the mental game for sure
18:50 Alex was so confident he swore…
I hope everyone knows just cuz someone loses weight doesn’t enhance their cardio. Especially losing that much weight is in my opinion bad for conditioning esp if he did he incorrectly. It’s not water weight he lost it was body mass and muscle. Deji is going to get tired. I’m almost certain he will gas
so awkward man so awkward
Sad that it would’ve been Wade Concept doing these in-person
Almost 2.5 stone loss.....respect Deji 👊
Usually when someone's this calm and collected they're about to whoop somebody's ass BADLY!!!
Deji is actually scary this time lmao
Why was this face off just a little chat
Not massively familiar with Alex, but his fidgeting and lack of eye contact suggests a little nervous energy.  Seems like a respectable guy; he could be playing the "nice guy" to lull Deji into a false sense of security but it could equally be that he was worried to trash talk in case he couldn't handle the retaliation. I think if Deji sticks to the game plan and has top cardio he can use that natural power to do some damage. My money would be on Deji.
I'm sorry but wasabi sounds like he's on estrogen
Fuckin amazing tho Alex using insane manipulation techniques 😂
MY MAN IS FOCUSED
Something fishy about this. Smelling like a fix.
Alex is mad gay
Alex foght fousey the one that used his face as a shield
How could you not like Alex Wassabi
Deji please win and don't let us down honestly I want you to win so badly I love you man.
Alex Wasabi actually a chill dude
Deji thinks he’s a pro after 2 fights Jesus, he’s turned up likes he’s just come back from the drug den, I think dejis just a clown he’s picked an easy target after 2 piss poor fights
Kinda seeing through this Deji facade. Seems complacent and putting on this cool and calm attitude.
I think wassabi is very scared, he was moving all the time in the face off 😎 you got this deji!
Hey deji, i hope this goes well! I love you man, you should go watch alexs sparring videos because then you can see how he fights, so its easier to predict which punches hes going to throw 😊 good luck man 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Let’s go Deji
Deji is such a lil nerd and he always acting tough. Fight is about to suck, neither can fight. Deji will be gassed and quit
is this a therapy session or a face 2 face?
Alex is so cringe in this video.
Let’s go Deji
Deji u have to get that dub FOR US🔥🔥
Deji will win
I’m dead deji keep tryna trash talk him but then Alex complements him😂
😮‍💨
Deji is confident but the way he is talking to Alex is like putting him downish hah  like acting likes talking calm and stuff hah
I’m becoming more and more uncomfortable watching this
19:32 lmaoo
why are they so nice
Alex wasabi looks like he’s Philippine
feel like alex know he’s gonna lose
Alex is scared 😱
🤣 Wasabi looks like he's just happy to be part of the occasion. I don't blame him though- strolling through the bright lights, get the chance to fight his online nemesis, see some stars, then wake up on a bed like it was all a dream 😂
Definitely got more American fans at least ppl interested in him then wasabi
I can tell both of them are dying of laughter inside lmao
Why is deji cringe like this
why are they not talkin shit
Deji lowkey being the aggressor but i like it 😂 ROOTING FOR YOU !
this was kinda moist tho
Alex going to smash deji face😂
guy in the middle is a professional shit-stirrer
Alex has learned a lot sense the fousytube experience
Really 2:31 you still got ko by him what you mean he not good
It’s not just me that thinks that Alex Wassabi sounds like Micheal Jackson right?
Lol wasn't ready for names 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Deji is actually going to lose. I think Deji is the better puncher but I don’t think he has the intelligence, the in ring management and sadly the heart to go all the way. I am rooting for him though but I just can’t see him winning
Deji feeling himself too much, like always lmfao
Lol
nah dis face to face mad sussy
literally no echo room makes it like they whispering
bru wat da hell did i watch😂 sht is too nice
"i get to fight the real deji" if thats the case, alex is fucked
sounds like deji is gonna lose another fight lmao
Alex is a top bloke, he seems like a genuinely nice guy.
31 YEARS OLD  he looks 18 and sounds like a 12 year old
Alex is actually a good person deji is the best they respect each other
Battle of the cringe lord clowns
I love the respect 🤍
am i the only one feeling the sexual tension here ?
Wasabi is defo scared he’s smiling nervously all the time
im cringing hard
I'm on Deji's side but he seems unconfident and a bit childish. I'm actually starting to like Alex and you can see he's more confident, calm and more mature
I feel like deji has said "ok, we'll see on (insert date here)" soo many times but hopefully he can back it up this time
I feel like Wassabi was trying to do anything to make himself look better 😂 when deji clearly made changes
Deji’s straight face 💪🏼
Very very respectful but very competitive at the same time ! Love to see it! Deji has buckets of confidence here
Alex is so nervous and big headed
Deji gonna hit him with jab and Alex gnna be like what was that and run for the fight
Come on dejiiii you got this🤩
Dead F2F
these 2 will go all out on saturday
Alex is shitting himself
Whats with wasabi’s tone. Creeping me tf out. Why’s he sound like he sweet talking deji
Alex keeps fidgeting and squeezing his chair. Mans is stressed, Deji is hella calm and not laughing and smiles
I see Alex winning this tbh 😭
Deji Vs Alex Wassabi - FACE 2 FACE
DEJI IS GONNA FUCK HIM YPPPPPP
Alex is nervous
I hate both but deji is more annoying, hope he loses
The fact that this face off is so nice is so scary for me,got too used to the usual trash talk and mean mugging fighters do 😂
If Deji loses I’m going to whip my weewee out
Seemed like old friends who haven't seen each other in a while having a chat
Deji u gonna win this 💪💪💪💪
I love how even small shit talk sounds like they’re both nice
Alex was just tryna be nice, Deji was just dissing him, like come on 😂😂
I don't really know Alex, I'm rooting for Deji. But Alex definitely seems more confident and relaxed about it all than Deji from what I'm seeing. For me it feels like Deji's calmness here seems too forced to hide a bit or nerve, rightfully so in my opinion, he is the one in this fight with everything to lose if he takes the L. Alex is not really risking anything. I'm very excited for the fight!
If deji loses this he’s done it’s over 3 straight L’s 0-3 he can’t afford to lose this
You can just sense how scared Alex is. Unlike deji, he is asking so many questions, fumbling over his words, and even showing hesitation to everything he says. Deji got this
Not sure if they want to fight each other or makeout
Alex is 31?!?!?!?!?
God have mercy on u through Christ
Let’s go dude!
Is it me or in my head i hear what is 7 x 7
Deji u literally cant lose this time, ngl if u do, ur fucked, but, I have all trust in you.
Alex thinks he’s going to a barbecue 😭😭
literally just make out at this point
Let’s go Deji idk the other guy looks nervous aye being in the ring iOS way different
“You wanna fight now?” Deji on that youngboy timing😂
Better than I expected tbf  I was expecting them both to be loud and roast eachother  Alex looks confident and ready  Deji looks confident , ready and focused   I have a feeling deji is going to be way to much for Alex to handle but if Alex wins I want it to be because he was brilliant on the night and not that deji let himself down
My Testosterone Dropped By Miles LOL He's Fighting Jesus
Deji scary I love it
This was the most frendly face to face ever 😭😭😭😭
I never liked Alex Wassabi he annoys me easily.
maybe a crazy prediction but deji 1st round knockout you can tell Alex is nervous
Deji about to lose
alex wassabi is a walking L
I feel like Deji is gonna cook him at a low medium high heat and win easy.
"you wanna fight now" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wasabi is clearly tryna see where deji is mentally and fitness wise
Deji Gon win I'm predicting it
Haha they're both very respectful. So much so that it's hilarious.
Let's hope there not this nice in the ring
Deji got this
go alex
this was good
I love this. They weren’t trying to inflate egos or anything, seems like they genuinely have some respect for eachother x
Deji beyond delusional and arrogant for someone who lost every fight he's been in.
This shıt is funny 😂😂😂😂
Honestly Deji is a lot more confident, he has trained a lot, lost 20 kg but Alex has had more experience
Luffy vs Kaido
Okay but actually is there any one in wasabis corner?😂
Ugh! I want Deji to finally get a W but Alex is so genuine! I’ve always like Alex as a human being! GRRRRRRRRRR lol
Bloody hell Deji, you’re scaring me with your calm and collectedness 😂. Go get him on March 5th!!!
lets go deji
Why Alex talking so submisvley
When Deji loses this fight his career online will be pretty much over…he won’t get any respect after losing every fight he was in..so this is huge for him
Deji is giga cringe
why are they just kissing each others arses
When is the fight
Wassabi ruined Dejis try of intimidating him by complimenting him, i'd say wassabi won the face off
Both bad Muppets.. I'd switch both of there lights out at the same time 2 on 1 🤣🤷
Love both but I want Deji to win this whole thing ❤️
Hey how was ur day deji want some flowers
Is this a face to face or  guidance counseling 😂
I love the way they trying to create kind of a "hate" between them so people want to view buy it more, but they just can't hate each other haha. I think it will be a great fight. Hope you get the W Deji
Man Alex didn’t even do nothin 😭😭
Softest face 2 face ever lmao
why Alex sound like he wanna kiss him
dejjjj
Great face to face tbh
Omg Alex does not look 31 he’s looks 26
Terrible marketing Ong
we support alex wassabi!!!!!
Go Deji from 🇺🇸  Ima need alex’a barber tho fade is crazy
Deji m8 fight someone the same level as you
If see deji is literally starting into Alex’s soul
I KNOW the Deji will have this one
THIS WAS DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
Deji his open workout looked so good
The mouth noises are killing me 😭
Sheeeshhh I kinda respect the wasabi for being so calm
It’s so nice 🤣🤣🤣
This ain't a face to face this a date🤣
lol this was wholesome..
this is a whole asmr vid right here
I agreed with Alex when he made a comment on sparing shouldn’t be easy, and deji saying his sparring was suppose to be hard but it was easy is pretty concerning. Shouldn’t be easy every single time.
Idk why but you can’t get mad at wassabi lol Deji trying so hard to hate him 😂😂😂
Deji went from bad guy  nice guy lmaoo for real 💀
I think deji was a little too aggressive and rude but yk
i swear they about to f*ck🤣
"clearly there sport isn't for me because I would be 0-3" I felt the irritation of Deji saying them words he wants this win
This was uncomfortable
Deji if u take off your shirt and see abs. Then…. I’m sold Big W🤛 it’s wraps🥶
I thought this was a podcast forgot they boxing each other...anyways look forward to it!!!
Rooting4 alex
Hol up? Did I just hear Alex swear?
DEJI is so damn confident I can already see Alex getting whooped bc of lack of experience and he ain’t ready
Deji looks like Debo😂
Gained my respect back for Alex after this one. Really cool dude
i fucking hate it when all they have to say is i’ve been training since _____ like no shit stfu and talk shit
Deji is wafflin fam
Alex is 31??
Deji should have told Alex that when he wins, he'll donate to his little brother's college. That would have been hilarious.
Respect for Alex but deji is gonna stomp this mf out
I feel like Alex came in with a good mindset in terms of knowing what to say and respecting whatever Deji put on the table. That is what I think stood out between these two and I liked the fact that Alex always answered in a calm manner which is unlike many other face offs that we see
Idk I go for Deji, but he's not ready. You can't fight cause you wanna prove other ppl wrong, you gotta do it for yourself find that hunger that Demon within you.
Alex is 31 man looks fresh out of y11
Lol a guy who lost 2 fights and some who’s been knocked out by fousey . Are the main event 😂
2 mugs
Deji getting whooped , 0-3 otw
Alex is so condescending
Easy dumb for Lebrun. Deji is my favorite lacrosse player
I believe Alex will be throwing the most punches this fight and showing what he’s learnt. while Deji will be more resourceful and hitting Alex with powerful shots like Mayweather- My prediction
this is acc nice, I don't mind this at all
You can tell deji wanted to get disrespectful 😭😭
This was a  therapy session
Alex is shitting himself tbf  He couldn't answer questions propley he tried to avoid the questions  and he couldn't have said the sparing partners names also I heard a lot of stuttering
Where is the fight????
Yooooo
Dead shit we want tension
40 pounds god damn
Never seen small talk during a face to face lol
This face off was so funny 🤣
Deij i see no fear in u  But wasabi looks lika a roblox boss for u
I got Deji to win this time
deji the fucking goat
Come on deji !!!
Alex sounds like a social services worker💀
Casual conversation
i swear they both trying to not laugh the entire time haha
Alex asking some of the most pointless questions, key psychological sign of uncertainty/anxiety
I can’t see anyone loosing I think it will be a draw
alex is too nice for this to be good
"I'm gonna shock the world"
imagine if deji loses this one😂😂
ogus twennyfiv
this was bad
Alex can't even keep eye contact when talking to him. Deji looks focused. Deji wins by round 3tko
12:46 wassabi has to be taking the piss 😭😭😭 dfkm
This was so goofy🤡
Getting ready to watch some cringe 😭
Alex looks like he was sitting it when deji said u wanna fight now 🤣🤣
Good luck in the fight deji everyone believe inu
cheee man like alex you know
He got knocked out by Yusuf
After deji said he weight 77 kg, alex' whole demeaner changed 😂😂
i was coming hoping for trash talk but i like respect too ,, good luck to deji from usa
They were the most humble I ever seen them
wasabi a W guy
You got this deji
Why I feel like they go no kiss
Fam what are these Americans on saying what do you mean bare times 🤣🤣
the way when deji is asking wassabi to fight, wassabi just straight up just keeps looking at the refree, literally whispering help me in his ear lol
Was this there first date 🤣🥰
they just linked and had a chat about boxing😂
seems like a date
hahahah Omg Alex can't fight he's too nice come on
This is the most boring face to face
This was boring asf what happened to the deji that punches walls
Alex: I respect you as a fighter  Deji: you're underestimating me  ...what?
Alex is shitting himself, meanwhile deji is staring a hole through him. COLD
I'm still waiting for the damn fight
Who else realised that Alex was constantly moving, cracking his neck and stretching, this mf was scared
This interview kind of made me want deji to lose lol I think it would be more entertaining and his questions are kinda stupid.  “Do you have knockout power”  This moron doesn’t know a clean hit is more important than a strong hit?
Without trash talk from alex Wassabi.. i feel like deji comfortably reveal himself like he's ready to give up from boxing and walking L..
This is the first time deji actually looks scary look at the determination in his eyes
Good luck deji we are all with you❤️
All I can hear is Alex swallowing
Leshhhgooooo Deji
Is this a date or a face 2 face???
I dont know who this alex guy is i know deji since long time but deji looks scared and alex look so much more confident deji can’t even speak
Alex is nervous af. He can't sit still. He's constantly moving back and sideways. He's trying to cover up his fear with a smile. Didn't think I'd ever say this but deji is definitely gonna win
what time is the fight
Respect for Alex
i gotta say, this felt a little cringe to watch.. I just want Deji to say nothing until he shows everyone what he has made of himself, not to prove something for others but rather for himself.     Love you Deji! Good Luck on March 5 <3
Felt like they were flirting haha
Y’all are having this the day that Covington and Masvidal have their grudge match… I hope Deji gets his redemption and I hope everyone sees that
Wassabi is learning mortal Kombat combos, and deji said "Ian learning to box"😂
Alex talking like he in a date with deji 😂😂
It looks like a date 😂😂😂😂😂
Alex for the whole 🇺🇸 is counting on you. Win it!!
Presenter is so cringe man
I can’t tell if Alex is trying to fight deji or fuck him😂
Alex says that guava juice made videos with him and Relanda without guava juice Alex wouldn't be anything
Giving Vinnie a 3 is crazy
Deji looks and sounds like hes lost some brain cells
Alex is to scared, deji gonna win ezy
Have to admit Alex is such a humble guy
How cld Alex talk shit with that voice
Is it just me or was this whole thing awkward.
For a guy that’s 0-2 he’s acting way too cocky. Bet all my money he’s gonna lose again
crazy how deji still acting like an 8 year old. making empty threats (actually worse than empty threats), and disrespectful attitude. it's insane how despite alex's cringy american attitude is being so polite and respectful to deji
I'm still team Deji but really respect Alex for how he handled this face off and the fact that he's put in the work.
Deji “I went in believing, now I go in knowing” Olatunji
Hope Deji doesn’t underestimate him
Alex wassabi is going to WIN mark my words i want Deji to win but truth us ugly!
When Alex said no way at 12:49 it sounded so sarcastic 😂😂😂
Deji, *you have to win*
They both seem so chill I love it
Keep up the hard work deji! Never give up
Deji: so you have no excuses   Alex: No   Deji: Ok perfect, cool   Yeah Deji Doesn’t care what he says in this interview he’s just looking to shred this mf come fight night 💀 and im so ready for that Deji 🔥💯 that’s the one that would rule youtube boxing
Deji pls win
Deji pls win
Deji pls win
Deji was not looking away😂😳 he was looking at the man’s soul
lets goooo Deji!
Why does the host look like Sebastian Stan
This looked more like two pals talking with each other
I want Alex to win tbh he’s been humble
Respect for them both
why was alex talking smack over internet and now he’s being all scared and tryna be humble
May the best man win Let’s see what Deji can do
Wassabi started looking so nervous after he asked Deji if he hasn't been training combos
Oof just get a room already
In my opinion Alex Is giving off nervous energy
I really wanted Deji to win, but after I've seen this face2face, I want Alex to win. Alex is so excited, down to earth and without bad blood while Deji is trying to trash talk when he has no reason to. I respect Deji's body transformation and all, but I've done it myself and without any coaches so.. Physical appearance doesn't play a big role in boxing, you have examples like: Tyson Fury, Andy Ruiz, etc.. May the best man win, but I root for Alex!
For fuck sake Deji if you lose you’re gonna look a Reyt twat 😂
If Deji loses maybe he can fight Logan Paul in a who will lose their 0 match
Alex shows so much lack of confidence
Look at deji man he's calm and confident wassabis just mouth Deji your a superstar famm
Fuck his shit up Dej
alex is going to knock out deji cold. He's a knockout artist and will brutally finish deji.
Even though I'm American, I'm team UK
Alex looks genuinely scared...
Alex is making me lose brain cells wtf man 😂😂
Deji pls win
LETSSS GOOO DEJII 🐐💪🏻
Alex is too soft spoken to trash talk 😂
alex was talking so much shit then he don’t do it in real life lmao
The respect is insane between the two
I was waiting for a prono while watching this how they be doing this but honestly nice to see them hunble
i like the respect they are showing each other but deji is going to destroy alex
Wtf 3:00 shit face to face may as well not bother
Cmon deji smash him up mush
Hoping deji wins
Alex seems like a good kid, good luck to both of them.
Why isnt any1 going for alex wasabi 😂😂 His not that bad comeon 😵‍💫😵‍💫
Deji picking easier and easier fights, hopefully he wins this
This was probably the most awkward, chill, and humbal face 2 face. 😂
You can tell Alex is shitting it abit
Deji: I'm gonna eat you alive Alex:😃
It should be a good fight as long as Alex doesn't just sit there and let Deji punch him
I just wanna fight you know u can fight without training for boxing
Why does my brudda look like he has ticks LOL
What’s wrong with Alex’s neck 😂
Do you wanna fight, he clocked it been to nice and he needs to try to sell it asap
they wherent at each others throats!! idk if i would care who wins or loses anymore this will be a good fight
Alex did get clapped by nick Ireland last year, but if he was constantly working hard , we have no idea how good he will be.
Think alex should get his neck checked out
a lot of itching and stretching  from wassabi...not so confident after all
🤡
No way Alex wassabi representing USA 😭, get this man off
i was vouching for deji until this face off, but the way he’s being with Alex was shitty and fuelled by ego. I now hope he hangs up his gloves when Alex wins. Alex was really polite, humble, honest and optimistic, as a new-comer to the sport, those values are far more respectable than Deji’s arrogance and ego driven anger
Definitely the most ready we have seen Deji he looks stone cold
Deji looks ready this gonna be fun to watch good luck to both fighters
If Deji loses, he’ll literally be the worst YouTube boxer.
This was actually really chill 😂😂😂 go get him Deji!!!
It’s easy to hate Alex Wassabi.
Alex sounds like he's trying to seduce Deji 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You can tell Alex wasabi isn’t confident just by his body language,  he’s jerkish and his eye contact, they way he’s smiling at deji trying to show he wants to win, Deji’s is way more confident just because he not trying to show off, he’s focusing on himself etc.
alex’s energy is so jarring
Alex is to humble to go at
The way he cracked his neck my man looked possessed, he must be shook.
W
Alex: "you only had 1 sparring partner?" Deji: "At the time yeah" Alex: "oh Jesus"
Went down to 77 kg that’s actually crazy
I was waiting for them to make out😂 I mean both were so nice to each other
I wonder if the legendary Reng Saeed will appear
When tf was Alex 31 I thought man was 24 😂
They lowkey flirting
They’re not even talking sh*t
why are they ebing so nice together
Anyone else notice how good this mediator is at keeping the conversation going
deji man. fight for yourself to fight to impress others show all them people that u have been training for this
Come on dej
I know who Alex wasabi is I wouldn’t say he’s a nobody, but why him? do they have a past together or something, this fight seems like it’s coming out of nowhere
this is kinda intimate
All honesty I’m happy for either one to win. Deji wins I’m happy bc I’ve been watching him forever now and same with Alex plus I’m from the US so I’m elated for this
Alex trying to be humble so when he lose there is no bad vids for him
this felt like weird asmr video
Deji im rooting for you man, you need this w lad!
AlEx is super nervous 😬
They are so nice to eachother, they might just hug if off in the ring lmao
Deji is going to quit again
77 kg? let’s go Deji
These guys trying hard to trash talk. Hopefully it will be a good fight. Respect to them both
Why did it have to be two people that made my childhood
This is ridiculous
i think deji was waiting to go off at alex but alex was so nice so deji kept himself together 💀
deji and wasabi fight me
RESPECT
Deij looks fully focus!!
And I’m a deji fan lol
Deji is going to get dropped
I liked Alex in this
Wassabi speaks so softly like he’s Michael Jackson lol hope his punches aren’t soft as well
i've never seen anything so polite in my life lol
THE GLOVES ARE OFF 2.0
team deji all the way but both of them are so nice to each other maan, wholesome shit
There both nice guys it’s cringe
Alex Wassabi reminds me of Michael Jackson.
Are they gonna fuck or boxing ???  I'm just confuse
Cameras gonna go off and bam, Denise with the flying knee
Wtf is this 😂😂😂
Alex is fucked
Deji wins by knock out in the third round
What is this deji, sholw us the real face 2 face, like dude what is this?
Damn why is alex so sweet xD And deji lowkey is too
So what I've gathered here is  Deji is going to drop him early  Or Alex is going to win by split decision. Edit: Alright after seeing the open work out, Alex is going to get hurt lol
they gonna hug and makeout or what?
i want alex to win but im pretty sure deji's gonna win
This is humble and genuine. The type of face off I like
this was a weird face 2 face lmao
“youre learning combinations?”  “ye are you not???”  “im learning to box”  that was brilliant deji
Don’t really like that Deji thinks he only lost due to his cardio. Vinnie was spot on with his hits and bobbing, weaving and dodging out of the way. Just saying not to sleep on vinnies skills. He won fair and square
Alex is gonna beat tf out u deji
Deji looks calm and confident, Alex looks nervous.  An interesting fight, Team Deji all the way.
DejiW💯
Every time I look at Alex I hear the circus music
this is just a nice podcast lol
Goodnight and hopefully goodbye for good deji my man
This was some chill ASMR face off 😂
okey yea sure every thing went respectfull and rlly hope to see real skill from deji even if he might lose wich i hope he doesnt i would love to see the skill cuss thats what its all abt
Can someone plz tell me what's the song at the beginning and the end of the vid
I hope both of them the best they both one of my fav YouTubers
Alex gunna get knocked out like benazlart and Landon
Why r they being so nice😹😹😹wtf so boring
Ayo who’s Alex’s Barber?
nobody said that the interviewer is very good.
Man, just read the body language from Alex, I’m rooting for Alex because I love going for the underdog but Deji seems like he’s taking this
I ain’t gay but Alex’s teeth…hear me out
Where can I watch the other face2faces
team deji
Are they on a date?
this wasn’t a face to face this was just a conversation 😂😂😂😂
Alex on that kill them with kindness mentality, hes too nice lmao
Wassabi's getting done man 😂8:38 Wassabi realising yeah shit everything he's saying make sense im fucked  It was at this point he knew, he fucked up
Watch this stoned it’s hilarious
Deij already wearing the sweat suit to lose some weight.
Why was this so awkward 😭
I find so funny that Alex was just saying u have bad cardio deji don’t have poor technique and his patterned his cardio so Alex need to be prepared alexs words ‘my coach tells me to I do it’ deji coach said ‘he says I want to do it again’ deji hungry for this Alex be careful
This was a qna
Looks like Naruto and Sasuke... You feel me
Just imagine if he loses💀
dejij is gone lose again
Alex is just winnie 2.0, he's not all there mentally and physically, but this Deji isn't the Deji who faced Winnie... and this time Deji's gonna convince his opponent to get some sleep right there in the ring !
this shit is fake and for views
Don't know who Alex is, I've heard of him but never seen him. Seems like a nice guy though, best of luck to both of them. Especially Deji..... C'mon Dej!!!
Deji will take another knee for BLM💀
No one: Literally no one: Alex Wassabi 😁😁
wasabi whispering like he was trying to fuck someone in the room bruh 😂
Go deji!
this was almost an akward date
The fact that DEJI is calm In this face 2 face shows that he’s really serious about fighting and he wants it
Lmfao I don’t watch your videos
Let’s go Alex 😈
What is this are They going to cuddel
Deji can't lose this + 4:12 Cap
I can't lie, as much as Wassabi showed his respects, Deji will without a doubt decapitate Alex's body every step of the way
Deji may appear to be calm and relaxed, but it seems more like he's deflated, anxious and withdrawn. He's sometimes saying things, but it's like he doesn't believe himself. This won't necessarily reflect what happens in the ring, though. Once they're both actually fighting, and Deji gets a feel of Alex, I'm sure it will settle his nerves. More importantly, if Deji has been training hard enough, he will have a great chance of winning.
Wasabi was literally bumlicking deli the whole time 😂😂
Because Deji hasn’t laughed for once ik he’s serious 😂
This was awkward to watch Iol.
Much better better when it aint just shit talking. just two calm guys actually having a conversation.
Deji is gonna shock the world😂
Alex body language shows how he’s not as confident as he makes out
They had a pleasant chat
Why do they sound like they flirting
As much as i love it when 2 fighters just can’t see each other and not scrap this feels so much more real if ygm they are both training hard and both respect each other and they know the best man wins.
Lmfao they’re chilling
I feel like Alex is acting confident to cover that he is nervous. I guess we’ll see on 5th march
W
"I don't watch your videos, sorry" lol The guy in the middle did a really good job.
Where’s the kissing scene
Really love this, both are super confident and respect each other, this is how face 2 face should be.
Does any1 actually care abt this fight
I’m commenting this before I watch the video just to say prior that I don’t want to see Deji all cocky and saying shit like, “Im gonna destroy you”  Deji’s words are always big but we need to see him back them up for once.
Holy shit, 90 to 70kg, in that short amount of time. thats actually so impressive
Alex is too nice lol for some reason I believe he gotta killer instinct
Damn they both seem pretty confident. I think DEJI has that edge though. He looks hungry for this win.
I want deji to win This and then win like 6 in a row
They should of just turned those chairs around by how nice they were to talking. Might as well just sat regular haha
boi you betta not lose Deji
Why are they flirting? I thought they were fighting each other
Why the fuck does deji look like a beast right now
This is the most nice face to face LMFAO
Dont prove people wrong, prove yourself right. Stay calm and focused 💯🙌
Deji, kick wasabullys a$$.
wassabi looks really impressive he shows his confidence but also respect and humbleness while deji looks rattled he looks awkward and shocked before this i was in the middle and undecided on who i thought would win but after this im leaning towards wassabi winning either way just hoping for a good fight no matter who wins
they gotta  do a collab this is hilarious
I'm sorry to say, but deli will lose
Oh Alex is going to lose, guaranteed.
why can't you bet on this, would be free money loool
i really do hope Deji i can’t bare to see him lose again i have high hopes, if he loses then i give up
Alex still sounds like a girl
hopefuly you laid off the kfc
They both dont look like they take each other seriously 🤣😂 there underestimating each other and those two things are the keys I seen in this you got to take every opportunity and opponent seriously and never underestimate the people around you those are the two things you need for a fight 🙄🙄 dont matter who wins or loses good job 👏 😉 👍 👌 on that main event
This some cringe level of humbleness like come guys talk some shit
I hope this dude alex wins, he seems very chill and seems to have a better view of boxing, but whats for sure is that i want a good fight
Deji looks calm collected confident and sharp. My bets are on deji lets just hope it ain't a act
\
Deji dip your hands in that wassabi
Didn’t know anything about the Alex guy but he seems very likeable, hope he gains a lil respect this fight but teamdeji all the way.
Deji is trying to be intimidating but he’s too polite and Alex Wasabi is too positive. I’ve never seen Alex angry or Deji angry so I hope they’re both different people on fight day.
Remember that comment ...deji will knock out Alex Wasabi after 1 minute and 30 second
This so wholesome it actually made me happy with all the bullshit going on in the world
Great to see a reasonable fee on such an event. More of the boxing should be like this it would get more attention. Good luck both of you. Deji wins  body shot TKO in the 8th
I see a rematch in the future😆
They are very nice
ive only watched 4 mins and theyre vibing and im so confused
I'm saying it now, they gonna be best friends after this fight coz look how they talking to each other no hate no rudenes no shouting no aggression
I actually like Alex he’s a good and chill guy
Why alex looks like he that he is so confident and scared through out the whole video like he knows that deji will rock his face to the ground
Deji gonna humble this guy
It's literally just a nice conversation lol
this Alex guy don’t seem that bad
Alex is awkward
State of dej
I can see the devil in deji I kinda like it
Alex wasabi will win this for sure.Deji is just way over his head
This doesn’t look like a face to face to a boxing match 😂😂
Why tf does Alex keep whistling "let's go" in my fucking ear😤
alex cracked like every joint in his body 12 times thats a sign of nervousness
I hope when he said Alex said it’ll be a battle then him getting dropped
I respect both of them
Sorry but Deji being 91kg is mad
much dank is gonna have fun with this one
Alex fumbled hard when Dej asked what pros he sparred😂😂
deji looking like rocky but yknow a btec version
Deji tries too hard to be tough
I like the respect show by Alex tbh
Deji just looking him straight in the eye
Alex trying his best not to kiss deji
deji is a little to cocky after being 0-2😂
Was this an interview??????
Intro song 🔥🔥🔥
Am i the only one who thinks wassabi sounds like the child toucher michael jackson ( white one )
Can’t wait to c deji the bum loose
Got to back deji but I think alex will win.
most fuckin humble face2face ever lmao
I dont know i think the reason im cringing is because im high
I’ve took a liking to alex, seems like a decent guy.
Team Deji 🙌
What is the song into!
alex wasabi sounds like that one video of chief keef saying he 300 year old
Deji looks like he's wants to KILL HIM
"I'm learning combos are you not" ... "I'm learning to box😎😎😎😎"
Are they having a date or a face of?
alex is lowkey scared u can smell it
He both are respectable
The respect they have for each other is insane
alex is too nice, im not sure how deji is going to want to hurt alex lmao. i hope deji wins tho
I remember ryan higa and alex doing a parody of boxing eachother 😂
you know what respect to alex man. rooting for deji but good luck to both of these fighters
Alex wasabi looks like he is like 14 . Deji beating this kid means what?😭😭😭😭😭 Give slim a chance coward
18:49 Alex swearing. Things getting real 😂
sex
This is bringing me the OG youtube boxing vibes
Temper is so high omds 😂
Deji losing
Alex will get crumbled man
Deji is mad humble now 😂 what happened
Alex is afraid of deji but he doesn't want to show it
Alex now is what Deji was.  It’s like he’s fighting his past self
Alex seems alright but his voice is so annoying
Deji is coming out cold this time
If deji loses again especially if it's against Alex Wasabi he's entire career in boxing and youtube will be ruin
mahch fif is the new augus tweny fif
Some of Deji's arguments are so fucking cringe
🐐
20:18 Deji just said what's eating him Inside he smiles and act all tough to hide what's inside. HE HAS NOTHING ON THE TABLE!
he’s still boxing😭
deji is a failure man. just quit boxing
Alex is exactly how deji was in his first fight. Coincidence? I think not.
Deji knows he’s got to go for the knockout
I thought Alex was a douchebag. He actually seems like a really nice guy.
Ngl luv deji but after watching this Alex taking this. 😐
What's the outro song
i was waiting for them to kiss, wtf was this
Most chilled face too face ever 😂😂
21 kg sheesh can't wait
Nicest Face2Face ❤️❤️❤️
So awkward I love it
Alex didn't sit still that whole time, he's kinda looking nervous
Deji didn't talk too much but when he did ask questions, he caught Alex out. Cmom my g deji!
Gives me Gay vibes
alex is scared thats why he's probably being nice he doesn't want deji to fuck him up
Wasabi is here to win he is a hand picked opponent but team deji get a win and go on
“This is his first fight and he’s talking like he’s a big shot”  - Deji…0-2
Bruh the lack of fight knowledge is so glaring bruh yes deji could’ve used more time with his new coaches but most fighter start their actual training camps is 6 weeks out
Lets go deji, you will knock him in round 2.
Oh damnnn 👀 😯
cardio being a massive factor for deji and that extremely big weight cut will have a factor on your cardio also
August 25th = March 5th
3:10 these niggas having a normal conversation as best buddies
U better win u handsome big juicy deji
At the end of the day win or loss the respect is there for Deji.
The amount of gulps I heard 🤣🤣
This is awkward but in a good way😂
IM GETTIN AUGUST 25TH VIBES
Watching this made me want halloumi 😂😂
God Loves You Remember That 🙏🏾❤️✝️
Wasabi never fails to be cringy
bros a smiley waffle
First Alex was talking like he was on ft with a baddie 😭 Second damn Alex does not look a day over 25 he is 31??
19:34 Deij : Is that what youre learning, combinations? Was : Yeah... ? You're not? Deji : I'm learning to box.  Badass moments?
Ngl I prefer Alex Wassabi’s attitude, martial arts are about self improvement, you’re automatically a winner if you’ve learnt something
Aye, so what's the intro song? 🔥🔥🔥
Watch Adam and Slim jumping on the bandwagon as they're salty af 🤣
Cmon dej 🤟🏾
i respect these guys
Alex is just bragging about his training camp
Comment section proves everyone a hating ass weirdo 😭
I feel like I’m watching two ppl on a first date
why tf does that guy look like sebastian stan
I Respect Deji's honesty, he has definitely grown as a person. Alex seems genuine, this fight is going to be interesting.
This was the most chill and  genuine face to face ever lmao
Alex is so cringe
alex is a pathetic little p word
Alex is scared.
Yall should check Alex's most viewed video LMAO i remember him.
It's so funny watching them try to be mean to each other but they really have no reason to be 🤣  It's also really funny how they try acting tough like I don't care I'll fight u right now but also they wanna show they're taking it seriously
While y’all Laughing & shit Deji look more Lock in.I truly believe the moment he lost his last why it changed him I’ve been watching his videos and he actually have been putting in the work, let’s not forget his whole mentality change he lost weight I mean what is he do win. Is y’all still gone Laugh then 🧐
JUSTIN SIMPSON - NO STRESS ON SPOTIFY
“You’re learning combinations” “Yeah I am What’re you learning then?” “Im learning to box” That got me tbh 😂😂
We stand with you deji and believe don’t let us down
This is cringe nigga just smiling asking all these goofy ass questions I appreciate how deji came to handle business idk why wassabi Ackin like he Tyson just cause deji lost y’all niggas are both on the same level honestly
This just feels like couples therapy
Yk respect to both for not hating the balls out of each other. Glad it was peacefull but it still hyped it but
what is this a asmr LMAOOOOO
Alex seems like a good guy and all but I agree with deji looks like there’s not that much confidence I think Alex will go for a points win
Both hella humble respect this
Someone please make a deji face off , side by side comparison. He’s come so far
this is way too fkn nice for a face 2 face
Today I learned that Alex Wasabi is 31 years old.  Had no idea.
This shit was dead, neither of them look like they want to fight.
Deji trying to act hard is funny. Alex is just too nice. But I really hope Deji can show his potential
deji all of a sudden turns into mike tyson in the fight
Wassabi  gonna lose he trying to be clm but deji  not letting that happen
goes to show you don't have to be rude as fuck to sell a fight, this shit is gonna be jokes and I'm gonna pay the £7
ey yo deji lookin mad calculated innit
Alex is a rly chill guy, after all this lemme c what he's up to
This is so stupid 😂
I love Alex he’s so positive!
LMAOOO
31!?
notice how alex couldnt keep eye contact with deji this shows imtimadation and deji never broke eye contact showing confidnce
"What? Are you not Learning combinations?.. No im Learning to box" this had me maddd😂😂
YOU GOT THIS DEJI!
Alex Wassabi seems like a genuinely nice guy
Deji looks like he’s definitely ready
Ok I know Alex is a clown but lik he really took this professionally but let’s be real Deji is going to slap Alex 🤣🤣
respect to wasabi
Wasabi said he has the height and the reach.... nothing about the skill and the confidence
Deji looks terrafied
Alex Wassabi’s body language is all over the place, eye contacts off, timid but acting confident, talking too much.. he’s lost the mental war
Deji thrown off guard he’s expecting trash talk lmao Alex dude is like this should be fun I expect a good fight from him and deji like yeah well your a butthead lol
Deji is gonna lose remember this
its 2:30 AM, and i was hoping some disrespect f2f but WHAT THE HELL AM I WATCHING? are they friends now?
Does Mr Wassabi have veneers?
Alex is WAYYYYY to over confident
Win this Deji Win this u need this
Tbh Alex looks a bit un confident little, I think Deji will win this for sure, plus Alex hasn’t won or even had a boxing match so it’s difficult for him and in front of a crowed so deji will defo win this lol
The amount of respect between these two is great
Deji I hope you win but you being to cocky.
U can win just put the work in
Half way through & already one question that Deji answered I don’t like “If you lose this fight are you done?” The way he answered it.
This is a date lol
He's gonna shock the world.... a 3rd time...
I dont think alex is going to win.i just cant see him winning
I don’t watch ur videos 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Id laugh if deji knocked him out in 1 punch
Very friendly conversation
Duuuude, this is ssssooooo wholesome
They’re deffo touching tips 👉🏿👈🏼
This is the most passive face2face ever lol
icl Deji is coming off just a tiny bit coccjy
Seems a little shaky there Alex 1:07
March fif you’ll know
If deji doesn't win i stg
If deji loses again Idk
lets be real, neither of these guys are ruthless boxers theyre fighting to prove something to themselves more than its a rivalry that they try to portray and its clear as day compared to Deji and Jake even in his first fight when there was an actual animosity.
You hafto win deji
good for him but alex isn’t hard to fight against 🤣 Joe weller is better
To be honest after watching this I think that Alex might actually be a nice guy. But hopefully Deji gets the W he needs it alot more.
I feel so awkward watching this. I still think Deji is going to lose. Wassabi has been training all year. I remember he met with Fousi about 7-8 months ago and Wassabi was training hard then. Wassabi has been waiting for a fight, and fighting Deji as a first is a perfect opportunity for him. I want to see Deji win for once, but I doubt it'll happen...
Alex needs to shut up what a knob
His opponent isn't even a challenge. This is the guy who got knocked out by fouseytube smfh. Deji you're not impressive and are taking an easy fight. You're not a professional boxer. You entertain kids so stick to YouTube
Alex looks like he wants to skip the fight and get to the part where they’re friends and make a hydration company together
If deji don’t win he should quit everything
I miss the time when I came back from school to watch Deji reacting with his dad or opening mail . Good times
this looks like dating show
Why is deji being a prick
I want them to be friends tbh
Bruv gave vinnie 3/10
I can't wait for the memes 😂
Grown man Deji!
🇬🇧
Deji is finished just from looking at this interview
He went from mid 90kg to 77kg well done deji
The way I wouldn’t be able to stop laughing 💀
Alex: you would beat me if you trained with the coach you have now. Interviewer : I see you have a lot of confidence
Seemed like two friends facing off 😄
This is funny. I used to watch Wasabi productions when I was really little and would have never predicted him boxing comedy shorts gamer lmaooo
Passive-aggressively sweet-talking each other lol
GOD BLESS
There’s definitely some sexual tension between these two
Never heard of this Alex Wassabi but I can't believe he's 31. He looks and has the demeanour of a 23 year old.
deji is like tryna be mean but alex is just to nice lmao
Alex looking pretty handsome in this interview ngl
They like flirting with each other
Deji looks like he’s a little too confident and underestimating Alex 🤦🏽‍♂️
I’m more scared for deji cheeks
Deji W incoming
Deji abouta rock the shit outa alex
Deji does realize you don't have to keep staring at your opponent during a face to face right? He did this with Jake too, makes him look like a creep.
They try to have that cool calm collective voice  to show their opponent that he is, but they are just giving each other compliments lol it's so cring
Deji was so stand-offish lmfao, remember he has a lot of pressure
Cmonn dejii🙌🏽
Parents evening in school be like
Damn from 93kg to 77kg even if he loses its a big W
20:36, is it just me or became Alex a bit scared when Deji was being serious about fighting right now 😬
I feel so bad, I know this was definitely supposed to be wade :(
Alex: why did you choose me🤔? Deji:😐😐😐
Alex think's he's a pro boxer and he's never had a fight
0-3 💀
Deji, I was with you the whole time until this Face2Face, stop being so fucking arrogant when you’re 2-0 to shit boxers. Get real with yourself, you have both trained extremely hard, you are no better than Alex. Humble yourself and let your actions speak louder than your words.
alright I need a lil bored video for this
Ik the face off was genuine and humble and stuff....but dangg this was boring😴
The most humble face 2 face
Man deji is gonna lose and its just gonna be so terrible i wish deji the best man cuz ive been watching him since day one
For those of y’all who can read body language, who looks less confident? i can’t tell
The only person that sounds like they underestimating any one is deji, he picked Alex cause the guy looks soft.. Deji sounds dumb cause he's buying into the hype his youtube friends told him, Vinnie wasn't just cardio he was a better fighter than deji punch placement, he's out here underestimating his ops... Deji the last person to be talking to any one about excuses that's all he's been making descrditing the ass whooping Vinnie gave him talking about just stamina? You've boxed before Vinnie first time and you talking bout stamina.... Am irritated by deji saying he gave his all to his last coach but the training was light? We see his videos he gives up before the coach get the time done making just excuses... Deji is the person overestimating himself, many amateur boxers will destroy Jake and all of them, sparring them will help built a fighter better than sparring a big name
93kg to 77kg that's mad!! Big up Deji 👏 🙌
people can make fun of alex for being nice but it’s the same premise vidal would want, someone to be their best so you can learn more. it’s respect for the opponent, don’t rlly care who wins
Oh god mans said we will see march 5th
Deji do it for youself please and we all want this dub but you can end it with a better dub by knocking him out
Sssss
This was extremely wholesome
Both of them look nervous af
Deji is looking into his soul 😂😂
Deji vs Jake Paul next
Is Alex slow in the head 🤣🤣  Deji: “Yea I drink water” Alex: “What do you mean?”  Fuking idiot boi 🤣
Wassabi:  😁 Deji: 😐
Why was wasabi moving his head so much he just so eager to fight 😂😂
alex is waffling so much and you can tell how nervous he is by how much he is moving around in his chair.
31?! This guy looks like a baby! Wth I need whatever he’s using
Deji want a reason to smack him, but Alex be like c: ‘how much you weigh’ uwu let’s fight
Who’s here after deji wins 46 oops wrong timeline
The shorts made it seem so intense. Now it’s a battle of the compliments
Alex is too nice to be rude , I get so much nostalgia from him but Dejis  been my guy since I was a kid , come on deji
I thought the mediator was sitting criss cross. He is not tho
Dutlniv tioogattlyg
Deji wins on points
Deji is a very strange child but good luck hahaha hope you dont turn into a meme
Alex is such a good guy. He just can't talk trash
This is the nicest face 2 face ive ever seen
Where is the trash talk man 😭
I’m still at the beginning  , this has to be the nicest f2f
Cute face off
Lol this was dead af 😂
Respect to these two, but definitely going Deji for the win, he's come so far
deji has a whole different aura/energy 😈
deji turns up looking like a turtle
Deji tries way too hard to be something he is not. Even this, silent but focused persona is blatantly orchestrated. He wastes too much time on catering to his image, and concerning himself with what people think, as opposed to just legitimately investing in himself and having a fighters mentality.  Once a quitter, always a quitter, it's a state of mind. He repeated over and over again that Wasabi is underestimating him.. yet, he was the only was drawing comparisons between them, and stating flaws in his game. Whereas, Wasabi seems to be training under the impression that his opponent will show up to Win! I don't get the same vibes from Deji. When he said he would walk away from boxing if he loses again... quitters mentality.
Big man I've been watching you for years, if you don't win I will be disappointed
He's 31😮
🔥🔥🔥
Ngl wasabi is being too cocky! I hope deji drops him!
What in the tinder blind date is this face 2 face . . .genuinely looks like Alex is tryna move to him ... dfkm
how does deji have ten million again
alex sounds like hes tryna flirt lmaoo
The first few minutes are very 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈😅Deji I hope you get the W 🙏💯
What size gloves and are there heads guards??? Sorry I didn't do any research.
Deji was speaking factz when he said that Alex wasabi is lacking confidence. Notice how Alex is avoiding eyecontact with DEJI?
Come on Deji lad
Deji just a posh privately educated siver spoon boy
Bruh they gonna be exchanging more complements than punches in the ring 😂
Deji is winning.
I hope Deji gets knocked down cuz the guy has been clowning Alex for years...no wonder he failed himself in his own fights
Alex the whole time: wha wha what do you mean
let's go
This is the most honest face to face hahaha... No one getting cancelled for sure 😊
Alex was trying so hard not not to be the bad guy
Alex sounds like a calm guy yk
Please god just win this fight Deji it’s gonna be fucked if u don’t
Deji chatting like his a world champion lool washed ute
are they flirting or what
Wtf is this?? why they so quit 😂😂
“Wanna fight now” 😂
Why does this whole thing sound like pillow talk ☠️😂
Get the win Deji we believe in you
Deji is not that same childish Deji anymore,i swear after watching this face 2 face i have a feeling that Deji is gonna win this fight!
Low key they just want to fight
yes deji yooooooooooooooooo
Despite wanting Deji to win, I love Alex’s attitude and the way that he is approaching the fight.
This wont sell a fight
Idk who Alex is but he seems like a nice guy. Deji my guy, it’s time to celebrate a win 🏆 let’s go!
Feels more like a date than a face 2 face.
so excited, GET THAT W DEJJIII
These 2 seem so happy in the start its so weird
Wassabi wins
it’s coming home
This is a win-win! Deji either achieves redemption, or we get one hell of a laugh!
Haha wtf I wasn’t expecting Alex to be a nice guy😭😂
Such a boring video but still exited for the fight
He'll lose, bet
Not sure who's gonna win tbh both seems to have alot of confidence all I could say is if deji loses that's just the end of it
Cmon Deji you got this
yk what alex is actually a nice person wtf 💀
Looks like two best friends trying reconcile
If Deji looses his career is literally over
This is the only fight I'm paying for to watch
This is what’s going to happen deji will ktfo alex, there’s just no way Alex is winning
Alex is just being relatively nice n Deji is trying so hard to intimidate him
Deji looking at Alex for the whole video
looks like two best friends meeting after so long getting to know each other more deep lmao
I can’t take Alex Wasabi seriously 🤣🤣
I kinda like Alex’s personality idk y he is kinda nice
This is like a first date or something
I like this, I couldn't imagine this F2F being hostel. Deji is a lot smarter and his mind is a lot clearer. There's no bullshit distracks now and stupid remarks. Finally the YouTube boxing I've always wanted. (BTW I haven't watched the entire video yet so my opinion might change XD)
Look.  This is not UK vs USA.  Nobody likes Alex wasabi, in either country
Deji and Alex do be bipolar tho. They talk normally and respect eachother and then remember they’re meant to be proving who’s the better man 😂
BRiNG BACK THE DUB DEJi!
Its so funny how Alex is just happy and cheerful and Deji just playing it hard and tough when we all know mans soft as butter 😂 this is going to be a very interesting fight i hope
I already know my man has it the bag LFG
i'm excited now that both of them are really confident
Alex’s voice sounds like Michael Jackson 🤔
Guys does anyone know what time the fight is on Saturday uk time?
I have a weird feeling Alex wins
if deji wins, he should fight guava juice next lol
8:38 Alex got him there tbh
What is this? half expecting someone to bring out coffee and a couple of biscuits for these guys. Isn't this where they're supposed to trash talk and get into each others heads? I feel like these guys are 2 friends that haven't seen each other for a few years and are having a catch up XD
No one :  Alex :Less go
Why are they sucking each other up 🤣
The one thing I’m gonna say is, don’t underestimate Alex it seems like you kinda are
Dejis trash talk is so weird and bad. This dude definitely gives off rapey vibes.
Alex showed up with cocky bravado and a fresh haircut. He clearly rehearsed some of what he said. Deji showed up in running clothes with unkempt hair. And all that’s been on his mind is clearly boxing. He seems unshaken but any questions and is calmer than usual. I’m not saying this means Deji will win. But he seems a lot hungrier than Alex. That’s just my opinion as someone who has been in combat sports for about 8 years now.
I feel like I’m watching a dating show 🤣
Deji Said He Is 77kg So He Is 169 Pounds And Deji Just Locked Straight In To Alex Eyes Man
Good sportsmanship
I actually like alex wasabi he’s actually a nice guy
alex wassabi actually won this f2f no cap
There is something likeable in Alex for some reason
Team deji ❤️
People are seriously underestimating Alex. He has literally been training his whole life for this.
Thanks to you dej i subscribed alex now
This reminds me of Woodley vs Wonderboy ...  Alex used the nice guy tactic and I think it threw Deji off a bit ...
This was a pretty peaceful face 2 face I’m rooting for deji you got this
73 kg from 93 lets fucking go deji
Will Deji quit if its a draw tho?
You might as well just kiss 🤣
Wtf are these two friends, or  It's a fucking face off? they're meant to be ripping into each other.
When do they kiss
I really like how calm this face 2 face is😂😂
This might be the calmest face to face ever
Dejis face the entire time😑
Deji ain’t winning man
Is that Sebastian Stan interviewing them?
deji thinks alex is underestimating him, but it seems like its the other way around. Good luck deji
never watch anything of Alex but seems like a really nice and genuine bloke
Weakest face ever
I amma love you even if you lose
Bruh this is a blind date
deji looks like he wants to kill him
Both nice guys ultimately... not sure either of them have a warrior/soldiers heart, grit or determination??
This is not face off, this is homies catching up
Feels more like Deji is being interviewed by two guys rather than a face off
No bias I feel the power coming from deji
Why this nigga making his voice deeper 😭
Alex isa good startup deji build up you got this monke
Gayy
so damn nice to eachother lmfaoooo I fw it
alex is so cringe
When is this ? And Alex seem nervous!
I hope I'm wrong , but i think wassabi is going to win
I'm here
Deji is looking scary
Deji jus slap him up blood ah waam fi unuh jus go mental in the ring
Seeing nelson doing it on gloves off would be class
Dj u have changed I feel like u will win I want u to win gl
This ain't a face off, this is basically a meet up.. like wassup how you doin type of shit 😂    Nothing bad tho, I'm enjoying the respectful environment
ok alex looks more of a friend and just moving too much asking alot of questions and deji just looks like he's ready i think alex will definitely panic in this fight the pressure will get to him and deji will beat him 1st round ko
I made a prediction video on all the fights for this event!! Check it out!!
Why do I feel nervous watching this lol
Dejis gonna shock the world
Imo even if Deji doesn’t win, but he will, but if he don’t I’ll still have mad respect for him for just pushing himself to be the better version of himself because that’s what we all want out of life to be the best version of ourselves. And he’s achieved that even before doing the boxing. I’m very proud to have him represent our team and I can see him having his hand raised as he buries Alex
i like respect between fighters.
Alex coming out w all the questions whilst Deji is in the zone
Respect to both, changed my opinion on Alex, seems like a nice guy thats very sportsman like
Wassabi is super nervous he keeps fidgeting and all that trash talk but non in this face to face
This is just old friends catching up😭😭😭
I can respect Alex here. I hope he gets knocked out tho
idk but ship
Deji trying to intimidated him just does not work
Deji if you don’t knock or win again this wasabi loser I swear I’m unsubscribing on god we all rooting for you COME ON DEJJJJ MARCH THE 5 th put him to bed 🛌 💤 😴
Kinda disapointed even i can beat wassabi and im 15
Why is Alex so nice 😭
Alex is using the same camp as FouseyTube and lost. 🤔🤔
There’s some intense sexual tension in this video
Is the dude in the middle the Ring Announcer/Commentator for NXTUK?
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS FIGHT MAN
I think a lot of us are gonna proud after this fight💪
Alex : How are you   Deji : Stfu
Alex really can’t wait to play this stupid game and win the most stupidest prize of all time. Let’s go deji 🐐❤️
Love the respect “may the best man win”
whts the song at the end?
Where can I watch it online
For real though, Deji went in for the pure intimidation tactic here and Alex was just savagely killing with kindness during the whole thing XD but i think i'm more excited to see Ryan Taylor fight and to see Vitaly realise he's just a water muscle meathead.
The app Doesn’t all me to purchase it I live in the USA
alex: i never win spars bc my trainers give me hard spars.  also alex: i have knocked people down, made them quit etc😌
Should've given them some appetizers and there you go, a mukbang
Alex is really underestimating how a real athlete has to perform under pressure. Realistically all Alex has done is practiced he has yet to step into the ring which is a whole new ball game. Deji has a huge advantage in that aspect. I played D1 baseball and there are so many players that were so good in practice but never performed in a game because they just didn’t have it. Hopefully Alex does so we can have a good fight but just because you worked hard doesn’t mean anything, you have to see how you stack up against an opponent. So many people work hard at sports every day and get no where. Really pulling for Deji though!
Alex is fruity
what's the song at the end?
Alex is so calm cuz if shit talks too much and gets that L he will become a meme like Bryce...😂
ALEX DOESNT EVEN KNOW WHAT KNOCK OUT POWER IS AND IVE HE TBINKS HES GONNA WIN GTFOOO LMAAOOO
Wasabi looks ridiculously nervous
Alex mentally got him
feel like deji was being a bit of a prick towards alex. Alex is humble and respectful and feel like deji is just being disrespectful.
Terrible face 2 face
This is so hilarious because you can tell they don’t hate each other but they’re trying to trash talk but it seems so friendly😂
Deji looks like he came out of the hyperbolic time chamber
Wow what a romantic face 2 face 🤣🤣🤣🤣. I'm afraid instead of fight they may kiss each other.
Just giving eachother their game plan verry smart lads😂
LETS GO WASSABI
Just giving eachother theorie game plan verry smart lads😂
ye
-20 kg for deji  ok ok
love the respect
Oh nah Alex is done.
Deji is so calm and composed and way more confident. Hope he gets the W 👊
wasabi being so nice is kinda annoying
If deji looses to this guy he’s a actual mop
Come on Deji bring the W🥊 greetz from the Netherlands 🤙🏻
Deji is looking a like a beast, I hope hes gonna get this W but it won’t be easy..
20:40 was so funny lol
Alex really trying to pull deji😂
Imagine deji show up to the ring with new  hairstyle
are they in love with each other???
16:45 is why Alex is going to lose if he said he's lost multiple spars and then has to switch out, he's gonna lose
ngl i gained alot of respect for alex in this video.... feels weird.... didnt expect this at all
I really want Deji to win but I feel like Alex is going to win
Deji will lose
Anyone else not know that Alex wasabi was 31 years old?😂
12:40 Deji just lost.
Deji still acting the same like before, I don’t know what to expect this time
If Deji loses again I can't imagine what he will feel like bruh
too much respect between the both of em, this would be nice after the fight
thats the same guy that was on wassabi productions😳
Not the reason of losing because of cardio again but I'm  supporting deji
If deji loses its over
Let’s go Alex. You got this
Man deji, if u win, fuck the payday, do a rematch with vinnie then, ur a beast, keep up the good work
2018 deji: *says august 25th repeatedly  2022 deji: *says march 5th repeatedly
Giving eachother so much intel to their camps
This dude gonna lose again
as much as i'm on deji's side, alex's mood n how he's acted throughout the first 7 minutes i've been watching is rather calm and i actually enjoyed listening to his speech, deji has been hella bland n it really cringed me out, idk what's up w you, but that ain how you're meant to act in a f2f, it doesn't seem to be scaring alex, n you rather look hella tired like you bouta fall asleep, wake up man, have the same energy as him, if i was alex, i'd be thinkin to myself if you're either depressed or hella tired, mans smilin everytime he looks at you cuz he ain takin you seriously w your precious eyes n the way you're lookin at him, i liked the fact that both sides seemed genuine but, in terms of f2f i really liked alex's entire personality n how he acted it all out overall, however, i must say that deji has a chance to win, regardless by how much, there's a chance for him n i believe he can if he tries before his fight
I love how Alex is smiling the whole time, and Deji serious, in the last couple face 2 face, he seemed he like joking the whole time, he's gonna show us March 5th.  Deji for the win and 3rd times the charm.
this is hilarious to listen to LOLLLLL
Alex gulping a whole lot, I smell fear
alex has the gayest voice i’ve ever heard
alex was getting nervous twitching and losing eye contact
7:33🤣🤣 mam that one was a violation personaly I wouldn't 🤫🤫
If you lose to Wassabi, the man who lost to the human face shield, I don't think there's a way back.
2:13 don't make it gayyy
Wait alex is 31?!!?!!
deji looks locked in
Got to be the calmest face 2 face I’ve seen yet
Alex definitely doesn’t deserve the hate but you can tell this is a different Deji then the last fights… I’m putting money on you my guy
This was cringey as hell
This has to be one of the best in meeting in person I've ever seen. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Deji you got this I have my heart feeling for you man Alex good luck too I hope everything goes smoothly too
I'm sorry but he is literally the nicest guy on the planet 🤣🤣🤣
boa deji a demon now😂
What in the asmr is this
The amount of respect in this face to face
Why do all these clowns always sit there in the face 2 face tryna psychoanalyze each other, acting like they see something that is not there like damn you are not a psychologist please stop it!
I saw Deji blinking like 3 time the hole vid lol
I’m on both sides, I’m on Alex side because he’s Filipino and so am I I’m on deji side because he’s a another guy I’ve been watching wayyyy back and I wanna see a comeback
Alex is complementing Deji way to much
Deji man I swear if u lose I’m gonna give up on u ik u can do it
Is march 5th the august 25th of this generation?
Does anyone else think Alex sounds like Michael Jackson?
Much respect to both of them. Hope Deji wins this and redeems himself
if he loses this he needs to deadass quit boxing lmfaoooo
I love Deji but I feel like he’s being fake tough here tbh I still think he’s gonna win and I’m rooting for him but he’s not as confident as he seems to me. Looked like he was fighting back laughing at some points
litttt
ok good luck then
The kindness makes me uncomfortable
COME ON DEJ U CAN DO THIS
First minute in and I already know Alex scared of deji
My prayers are with deji. I hope he wins after everything he has said 😂
Dejis already won
Deji beats this queef bag all day let’s go!
This was probably the most genuine and humble face off ever in youtube boxing history
Dejis already won
Man looks like a demon he’s gonna destroy wasabi
Way more entertaining then I thought it would be
0-3
Lmao
I feel like the guy in the centre asked the same question 3times
Alex didn't say he has power smh 🤦‍♂️
I respect this video so much i rate you too both for doing this  but Deji got the W comon
Deji ain't looking intimidated at all
So... Deji didn't change positions much during that face 2 face, and usually a lack of movement in body language suggests complete focus, Deji is a lot more focused here.
You can tell deji is being cool calm and collected in front of Alex and Alex is matching him making the atmosphere very calm
The amount of respect between both of them is amazing. Great sportsmanship
He’s looking every where else but Deji’s eyes and deji calm tone is making Alex more scared and nervous he is looking everywhere else Deji is gonna win this fight far before it’s begun
Alex is cringe usually, that was his style of YouTube vids, but the guys been pretty nice and honest in this face to face.
Deji is trying so hard to be the mean and bad guy. But it’s the most friendly face 2 face
I’ve gotta be honest after watching this I’m hoping Alex wins seems like such a genuine guy
I respect both of these guys. They are both just saying genuine facts. I am cheering for Deji but I wouldnt be upset at all if Alex wins.
*JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU AND CARES FOR YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY EVERYONE*
hope this fight is either before or after colby fights. i need to watch colby absolutely maul journeyman jorge
Deji would work so much better if he stopped playing the cool game and acted like himself. Deji should be a jolly fucking boxer, who brings laughter between the fights. When the time of the actual fight comes, then Deji makes his point of his skill. He doesn’t need to follow this act of being cold and “bloodthirsty” or indifference.
you better back up what you said lmao, best of luck Deji. hope you do well
I can't wait for this. Deji get that W lets go!!!! :)
Deji look cold af
Predictions: deji will lose this fight and quit boxing forever
Deji remaining not breaking concentration not looking away for a second is a smart mental tactic as you can see the longer you watch the more Alex starts to move and he’s uncomfortable and he starts looking every where else Boxing is very much a mental sport as much as a physical one and he’s in Alex’s head the moment Alex looked away he lost the fight days before it’s even begun
The press conference is so late
I’m scared Deji is gonna lose… *Sigh
Alex: "I'm learning combanations"  Deji:"I'm learning to box" 😂😂
Deji has to win this one, after hearing him say he’ll quit boxing if he loses worries me. I don’t want my fav YouTuber in shambles
My man shit himself when Deji said “you wanna fight now”
Go get him Dej!
@6:20 I love the fact deji showing that he ain’t intimidated and staring him off whilst wassabi is smiling and laughing. Deji NEEDS to win this fuckin fight
Deji acting like a bit of a dick, Alex seems like a genuinely nice guy
deji just win
deji is confident
hopefully we see the biggest redemption from the big deji!!
This was a lovely date, thanks for letting us in
I don’t see this going in Alex’s favor honestly I want deji to win but even though dejis last fight was trash he still has it in him. I think it’s just a workout routine for Alex
Tbh I think deji went off at Alex unnecessarily he was actually being nice
I’ve never seen Deji look so calm, cool and confident! This just shows that he truly is at his best self. You got this deji! We’re all behind ya! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽😇
Why they giving each other sloppy tf??
Deji did well getting into Alex's head
Dejis stare is generally scary Alex couldn't keep eye contact
Wish my mom and dad could talk like that. They would still be together 😭
Look I want Deji to turn Alex into paste but I respect the goku like mentality Alex has
that gulping
It would be funny if Deji lost.
*Jesus Christ loves you and cares for you have a good day everyone*
Ayoo didn't expect tht from alex damn man actually being humble like i thought he is gonna be cocky as always. But after this he earn sum respect from me fosho.
It’s like deji vs whalberg he looks a bit similar facial wise
Alex uncomfortable af.
This felt like a therapy session
Interesting, Alex was proper trying to be psychological and get inside Deji's head saying he has no knockout power, and getting him to say how hes had only 5 weeks of intense sparring, Deji is screaming nervous energy and underestimating. But i feel the nerves will get to AW. Just hope Deji actually has tried as hard as he says, the big advantage to AW is that hes only had to gain 5lbs, Deji has had to lose 20 so not used to being at such a lightweight, but lets just hope for a competitive fight with respect shown at the end
Mental how Alex is 31! Looks like a 20 year old if not younger
alex is 31? i thought he was younger than deji lmao
I expected some trash talking but i respect these two still want deji to win.
Alex had nervous energy or something, the way he said “let’s go” every time deji said something lol good luck to both but I’m team deji, I payed to see him bring a win you gotta get this one my boy
It's like Deji's coach said in the previous video. Alex has absolutely no excuses against deji. His Head Coach said that he only had Deji for 6 weeks but the amount of work he put into boxing and the serious mentality he has gained just goes to prove that Deji has just the same chance of victory as Alex. Maybe even higher. I'm not underestimating Alex neither should Deji but I'm still very positive that Deji will come out with the overall victory.
first min deji already made a fool of himself XD
WHY TF THEY SO FRIENDLY
alex look s calm
Been supporting Deji all my life  And wassabi productions was part of my childhood  This finna be lit  Deji for da win!!
Wasabi talks to much in this interview, so annoying
Waste of Time Honestly
Why is he spazzing his neck like that😂
Deji u r so corney lol
CMON DEJ
One of them is gonna. Shock the World
wassabi at  the end was so exited and deji looked like he just wants to box
what sh  vid
alex is 31...
I can’t take these two serious
Deji is gonna get smacked up 🆙 and thats on dixie and charlie
I don't get why you are fighting Alex he seems like such a nice and kind guy
CMON DEJ, GET THAT W PLEASE!
alex is nervous, u can see it in his face, he would smile and his face would go red. you dont just go red in the face for nothing
Y does wasabi look like a shrimp
I like that Alex doesn’t want an easy opponent, ofc he’s gonna fight someone at his level but he doesn’t want it to be easy, he wants a challenge
Can’t wait till you gas out in 3 rounds again and lose so I can watch your stans cry
Deji this is the last chance you could do this we are counting on you 🔥🔥🔥
Deji has to win bruh
I see deji losing unfortunately & I would bet 1k but I broke. Come back here after the fight & worship me bc I was right.
Shushhhhh big up NDL spam W under
What do you think happens if Deji loses?
I have no faith in Delhi, he will be knocked out in the 3rd. This fake tough guy personality kinda makes him a clown, 0-3
“wanna fight now” alex shakin in his boots he wasnt expecting that
Deji looks serious
i love them both but i want deji to win because i dont want him to give up on boxing. As for alex this could potentially be the start of his boxing career and if he does lose then im almost positive he wont give up on boxing.
Change the title to: ASMR Face 2 Face | Soft Spoken Roleplay
This is the first face to face ive seen where they both have a great level of etiquette
deji is fighting someone who never been in a training camp in their life, embarrassing and sad. he will get 0 respect for beating alex, just a bully.
Man wtf even is this, 0 aggression in this face 2 face
deji looks homeless
Deji please don’t let us down
Deji is gonna win   He has already won the physiological game  He maintained eye contact  While Elex kept looking away
Lmao Deji wants to smile so bad. Seriousness does not fit him at all
Imagine Deji Loses
CRINGE Deji win
How come Alex isn't cringe anymore, what changed?
I have this feeling that Alex is gonna win... I hate it but I feel it
Is it just me or does deji sound just like the moderator
I sense a lot of sexual tension between them
Let’s gooo Deji
wtf is this theses guys are friends or something
This face off is too friendly 🤣🤣
Lol it looks like Deji is fighting with voices in his head.
Alex sounds like he’s sexy talking deji it feels uncomfortable 😂
Good luck to both y’all tbh
deji voice switches so much
This was so hard to watch. All I saw was two beta males that are scared to argue
"Now kith"
it will be a draw
Wassabi lookin nervous AF
Damn my man is serious without his glasses😂 if he loses this then 🪦
Let's go deji its almost time 2 sleep this guy
is this a face to face or a friendly conversation???
I rate alex seems like a calm guy
Deji looks cold
why does alex sound so nice
if vinnie is a 3 and he beat deji whats deji
Alex aint an ass hole but I want Deji to get the W, if Alex loses he can always try again, if Deji loses his enter boxing career is gone.  Deji has everything to gain and also lose. Alex has little to lose and so much to gain
I hope Deji doesn't just win and not follow up with good fights, you got this on Saturday
What the fuck is this jubilee 3 men dating in the dark
Deji lookin like a TANK    (Pun intended)
My man Delji looking ready and Unphased let’s get this win champ🙌🏽
Never knew Wassabi was 31…
This shit was more like a group therapy session than a face off wtf was that…
bring it home deji
My man deji is getting so much information.
There’s no aggression I hate it
cmon Deji we know your gonna win
Wassabi cannot sell a fight bruh
Come on Deji, I wanna see your bod transformation
W DEJI LET'S GOOOOOOO HE FINNA TAKE THIS DUB EASSYYYYY
You have to win this
I don’t watch your videos!😂😂 fucking Deji!😂
Deji is 25 and Alex is 31 damnnn . And deji acts more mature  lmao🤣😂😂
i like this serious deji
Alex keeps moving he cant sit still
MAN WENT TO 170LBS SHEESH. mad respect to deji they got more respect for each other.
While Alex kept it polite Deji was kinda just hostile
Dang we all waited for this face to face for two years since keemstar announced this lol
Alex is a nice guy, which will actually cost him in the end (as well as his lack of exp)
Deji looks like the crazy frog 😂
I can just imagine this being with jake Lmaoo mans would start talking maddddd shitttt
Alex's body language seemed a bit off, Deji seemed dead confident, trying to stare him down calmly. Regardless, I look forward to both of them giving an entertaining fight and going all out
Deji is so calm n composed , it’s quite intimidating
The most awkward thing I’ve saw in my life
This version of Deji is dangerous. He sounds like somebody who's got a chip on his shoulder. Deji in 3 (rounds)!
I love you Dej but let’s be real we’re all watching Masvidal V Colby on Saturday
LMAOO after deji said he has knocked ppl out before u can see the fear on Alex’s face 💀
I want Deji to win all the way! But the only way Alex will win is if it goes full rounds, and Dejis cardio will let him down. But Deji will win any other way.
Im so glad he didnt say 'Im gunna shock the world'
Wearin my team deji shirt for this
Deji do your best, My respect is nothing to anyone but you have earnt it.
We will see march fif
Bussin convo like they’re close boys💀💀
Deji u mong don't ask to fight someone now. Don't be a beta ffs
The that fousey knocked Alex out just sums up who I think will win, Alex may have good training but he ain’t got a chin
When is the weigh in
Wasabi is trying to act like the bigger person
Guys Alex was waffling and definitely not confident you can tell by his body language
Imagine if Deji loses the fight and he gets memed by this video 💀
This is like the butt to butt Jake Paul was talking about....HOPE DEJI WINS IT FOR THE BOYS
Deji therapy session
Bruh why Alex is showing the Joker smile. Not ideal, not scary, not creepy, just weird and funny
What the fuck is this 😂 and what is deji wearing 😂 corniest shit I’ve ever seen
wasabis finished
Who’s streaming it
I wanna see Alex get knocked out 😒
7:25
Alex is 31??
Funny how deji didn’t know what to say when Alex asked him why he picked him to box. He obviously choose an easy opponent.
not really selling the rivalry
Didn’t know if this was a face off or an ASMR video 😂
wtf is this lmao this aint no face 2 face this is circle time for compliments lmfao😂
Deji is finally acting cocky. I love it
I really hope they become friends after this fight
what the hell is this
I found this hella awkward ngllllll XDD
Fair play to these lads. Alex seems like a nice lad and a very respectful head to head. Hopefully that changes come the fight and after they will have a nice few beers together whoever wins. Good stuff 🥊
I’m liking Alex more and more tbh
You wouldn’t think they be fighting lol
Don’t really know anything about Alex, but he seems to have respectful manner.
Alex’s head the whole time ➡️↘️⬇️↖️⬆️↙️⬇️
this feels like a date
let's be honest both of them look like nice people let's hope it's a fun fight and they can be friends after
If deji wins this fight I will be so proud of him. Bring it home to UK. Bring it home to England.
Come on deji you got this
This was probably the most humble, chill and kind face 2 face ever 😂 no one once raised their voice, occasional small trash talk but nothing major and they both respected each other.
Deji is focused,will and fully determine mean while alex is overly confident, Team Deji all the way let's go dej you got this 👍 💪 👏 🙌 😀 👌
Most respectful face 2 face. Cmon Deji!!🔥
honestly think alex is just tryna get into dejis head
I hate to say this but I've got a feeling Alex will win just from this face 2 face
Wait what Alex is 31 I thought he was like 26
When 2 old school friends meet up
The start of this face off was more of an interview.  Both answered each other's questions with respect
Imagine it’s a draw🤯
rubbish face off
this was more like a catch up rather than a face off
Did he say hero ?
this is too nice what the fuck almost dont want then to fight
Alex sounds like a women
Why does this feel more like they’re on a date
face off? idk.... i'd call this something else
This makes me think they could be friends
Respect for Alex for not being annoying but he scared asf
Alex is very confident with himself 💀
If this fight is based on the interview which Ik it’s not deji should win. When someone starts rambling on to a simple direct question it’s never a good sign. Alex isn’t as prepared as he thinks he is and deji letting him talk and ramble is a smart move.
Alex’s skin fade is so shit
Alex looked abit intimidated towards the end of this interview
Deji is in de zoon
i dont think alex will be able to handle the pressure when he gets there
Wait what’s going on?
Alex seems like a sound guy they respect each other which is great for the sport, this is your last chance Deji prove us all wrong!!! 🇬🇧🤝
why are they so nice like wtf
Ngl I don’t take anything away from this. One guy has said all this before and lost twice badly. The other guy has never fought and is probably shit
Such a nice face to face, no drama, just respect and interesting questions. Team Deji all the way but Alex is a nice guy
I like how they low-key respected each other
Deji sounds like a villain
If deji lose IM done with him
This interviewer is good asf
Alex is 31 wtf dude looks 17 still
complete waffle by alex wassabi
guys when is this fight??
Why’s he so nice
Ayyo, why is so calm man....🤣
19:39 icl when deji said this lost my confidence is deji but hope for the dub
Alex is to nice😂😂😂
when they were making vids on eachother they were trashtalking a lot bc they were confident   but since they r in face to face I don’t think they want to trash talk to much before it backfires  on them
Wasabi was trying to soften Deji up here . I rock with Dejis intensity and focus. Got Dej 3rd round… stoppage via punches
I been a fan of alex for so many years and deji too but i stand with deji and tbh this was the most calm face 2 face ive seen 😁
you sure they are boxing?
I'm more excited for this fight than I was for all other youtuber fights
Honestly at least this face to face wasn't like the others just yelling at each other.
COME ON DEJIII
i actually think this fight is going to be close as fuck
Why Deji wearing baggy clothes make me scared again please just be ready to surprise the abs
Deji was just staring at alex like bruh chill it isnt all about domination
How friendly was this🤣
deji will not win
“I’m learning to box” went hard
I prefer boxing like this, none of that fake bs or cringe dog talk. Genuine and respect
I’m rooting for Alex icl 🤞🏼
i love dejis attitude, respect to both. W faceoff
What a shocking neutral they had there
Deji is such a child, he will never grow up.
What no big smooch at the end, what kind of romance movie is this
This is the most calmest face to face I’ve seen
Imagine paying for this fight 🤡
anyone want to tell these idiots how to use a chair?
Good luck Deji!!! You got this!
Not to be rude but if you lose to Alex🤦🤦🤦
Face off it’s about drive it’s about power
dead face 2 face
Come on Deji!
Wasabbi is a smart kid. He will win. Practising connering and taking in the little elements.
deji w by tko 2nd
Brah these dudes are chatting to each other like they're on a tinder date 😂
very nice and friendly face 2 face
My first two motorbike theories I failed because I didn't practice thinking it would be too easy. But the 3rd I smashed because I actually revised... Deji will win this fight.
Alex is extremely honest. It helps so you don’t fake anything
Deji I’m coming see u soon
16:57 That’s just a violation from Deji man
This is so dead 😭😭
Deji said Alex heart not in boxing yet his entire boxing career, his heart isnt in boxing..
Wtf is this ? They really dont know how to sell a figh lmao
Ngl if deji losses his career is over
dejis demeanor is so cold this entire video 🥶
I love how they’re just having a casual conversation in the beginning
Deji has doubts in his head. You can see how closed he Is
Team deji
Just two friends catching up😂
ITS COMING HOME ITS COMING HOME 🏆
Deji is scaring him with detailed boxing questions I like it
They both look confident
gonna be hyped asf if you grab that w Deji 🙏
After this I’m questioning his sexuality
intro song?????
They gave me the friendly CANADIANS vibe, and i love it lol
Alex talking like he’s back at the nail salon
You can just tell Dej doesn't wanna shit talk since he's coming off two back to back stoppage losses.   And Alex doesn't wanna say anything knowing a really possibility he gets clapped
Why do I like Alex after this?
This more like a mothers meeting
LET'S GO DEJI!!! 🙌
Hate too say but I believe alex is winning this, this is a new deji but alex has been single minded and focused for a long time now
Come on deji u got this
i forgot how dumb wasabis haircut was
I like this face off it made me think, it's not always about the adrenaline rush from drama.
Deji what the fuck are u doing hes clearly trying to mess with ur mind so in match day you wouldnt go full ham on him he wants to win
Energy dead
All this stuff is cool but I just wanna see who wins
I really wanna trust and put my faith in deji. I know it's probably senseless but I wanna trust he will win. But I know Alex is a tough opponent.
First 2 min it sounded like date 🤣🤣
Like a year or two later they’ll make a drink brand lol
So homie finna get his ass whipped and not have no fetti crazy
alex was always a really good guy
This is so tense
Wait Tyson fury opponent didn't come for the face to face press conference so did deji opponent didn't show up instead two interviewers with deji were was deji opponent Alex wassabi or was him the guy infront of opposite deji asking questions
Deji gonna lose 🤣
Alex swear he’s in deji’s head😭😭😭
Sadly the app not available in my county good luck deji hope you win this man 👏🏼👏🏼 Alex is a good lad hope he grow from this as well
Deji’s stone cold stare and low pitched voice is giving me goosebumps.
Alex giving all his cards hahaha coaches will be mad
jeez i hope alex doesnt win that would be so bad XD
First two mins was just dumb lol why did you want to fight me deji?? Didn’t know what to say… it’s obvious an easy fight for deji
i’m sorry but Alex’s smile gives me discomfort .
What pros 😂?
Wasabi doesn't have knockout power?
August Twenty Fif - March Fif
Deji tryna intimidate Alex  Alex:be's nice to deji
Alex is actually a really nice guy, good luck to both, but obviously want deji to win
I was confident and had full faith until I heard "I will show the world I can really box"
Saving the energy
You can tell Deji changed cause he’s calm
These are 2 mates catching up 😂😂
Looking forward to this, the most surprising thing about this video is that I learned Alex is 31, the dude looks like he's 19, damn
Deji is so dum , he literally gave him or props and he responds “ u uNdeResTime mE “
You can win deji i now that come ooooon deeeejjjjjiiiiiii wooooooooo🥊💪🏽👍🏽
Alex looks way to cocky for this man. Smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Alex gives me MJ vibes haha
The interviewer looks like Conor Murphy 👀
wassabi asking too much questions😂
Alex has my respect he’s truly improved as a person this fight win or lose for the both of them could gain a friendship
*This looked like a try not to laugh more than a face off🤣*
i dont even care if deji loses... i just want him to give us a real fight this time
why were they talking like they are friends arent they enemies?!
Deji is just staring at man 🤣
make us proud dej😤💪💪
Who actually gives a fuck about this ? Like I had to click just to comment this 😂
if dejo loses… 💀
deji was so calm, get that dub dej
Is this supposed to be an ASMR
This is just a nice chat  Alex is being humble so if he gets shit on, he’ll be fine
This is a wholesome face off
Anyone else think when deji said wanna fight now they were both gonna actually get up and fight😂😂
Deji is stone cold bruh
what is this
Deji won the mind games in this one for sure! Can't wait for March 5th
Alex sounds actually quite nice and genuine
The sexual tension….
Alex is getting knocked out 🤦‍♂️
Maybe they’re being real and respectful or whatever but that makes the face to face boring as hell. Throw some insults at least
Alex looks like he’s been set up on a blind date
Tank4life, fuck the haters.
not my man deji again with we'll see INSERT FIGHT DATE.. august twenty fif vibes
Probably one of the more gentlemanly face offs I've seem
Cmon Deji if u flop this ur finished
Surprised alex didn’t talk about his knuckles
Deji has a terminator face  That face says he's gonna win
I can't stop laughing!! This is so... Wholesome!!😂 lol
alex is so strest
Deji lost this its so evident
*We've all been waiting for this one*
I’m rooting for Deji but Alex seems like a good guy so good on him for that
Deji forcing the trash talk icl Alex is too nice
this is mad cringe
In the beginning Deji was like "ffs Alex we're supposed to act like enemies"
Deji looks focused and really ready and prepared to fight. Let’s go Dej get that dub.
tf was that 2014 intro AHAHAHA
19:33 is the best part of this video 🤣
19:18 That's a good question, Alex is a talking guy, with that question he responded to Dej with his tactics and what he can do. So basically he's a gonna try to do combo and land a lot of punch (he gonna try to win by split decision).
Come on deji
So if deji loses he won't fight again. He has doubt in his head. Lol. Alex Is smart laying traps for deji to fall into. 😂
Ik that deji can win not only that he is ready he has a great mindset
The respect between these two has been unreal in this video 🙏🏽
mind games alex wassabi
Deji no matter you loose or win...you already winning with the effort you doing to win this, we still got you man.
Alex is so kind lmao. Can' t take these two serious.
"Deji, do you feel pressure?" 'no'  5 mins later  "If you lose, will you fight again?" 'No i won't fight again'  Wtf are you on? Don't get me wrong I want deji to win but that makes no sense and you can tell Dejis trying to be a tough guy
Deji's looks made it look weird (sexual)
Deji will lose this again, oh my god
Tbf it's smart for Alex to practice right walks, the intimidation from the crowd could be the difference between a W or an L
Fucking love these two. They brought so much laughs back when I was a kid. Respect to both
Deji's confidence level is unreal. He made Alex stumble over his words a few times too. I can see it in his eyes. He's ready for it. Bring home that win Deji.
is this a dating show?
They brought in the Winter Soldier in case this was gonna be tense, but these guys are just smiling
Alex be moving a lot 👀
Jesus is coming back soon repent today and give your life to Christ 🙏✝️
This is actually somewhat wholesome
i see the respect between these two i hope this fight doesn't ruin their sportmanship.
alex lowkey gave deji all the info he needed to beat him lmao but respect to both
deji looks so bored ngl
Tbh deji is kinda underestimating Alex wassabi,  I just hope Deji knows that Alex has trained and he’s ready.
I don’t wanna sound negative but I’m sorry deji can’t lose man, he just can’t
I think Alex is going to win tbh but hope deji the best
5:24 Deji looks ready to fucking kill😂
Why tf is this soo awkward
Deji was stearin at Alex the whole time and alex didn’t look at him back. Could tell a lack of confidence from Alex. We shall se though!
I'm rooting for deji but Alex is so nice
After looking at Alex’s body and the things he has been talking about I can infer that Alex gonna get knocked the fuck out
I never liked Alex, but this video has changed that. I still won't watch his videos though
I like them both. The old deji would've been laughing, mocking, trying to impress. This time he's really direct, really strong and composed the exact same for wassabi, I see deji winning but fushow not underestimating Alex.
Alex wasabi villan arc
"I don't watch your videos I wouldn't know I'm sorry" That killed Alex Wassabi's ego 😂💀
Andy Boy!!!! Nxt Uk
U better fucking win istg
So they fucking or what?
Deji ain’t look away at all
They were trying so hard to look tough and not to laugh lmaooo
They both seem like they are trying to better themselves through boxing so fair play to them
What the hell is this more like a mothers meeting not a fight
Deji will be the greatest
Interviwer: Deji, what do you to see in Alex Deji:(I don't want peace) honestly lack of confidence 😂😂
This is so much more chill than expected
Never knew Alex was like this
USA dons are always acting fruity 🤣🤣
Alex really got nothing to lose and deji has got everything to prove. Hope Deji does us proud
This felt more like a date lmao
Wtf I wanted some drama y they talking like someone on blind date
This was kinda romantic
that man deji ready, he was tryin to fight right then and there
i feel like alex is gunna win he looks HUGE compared to deji, alex got no sleeves to show that, DEJI gots sleeves to..?
Just saying you got this dude...and let's make it weird I could knock out the three  of you easy...
Come on deji
Their faces the entire time Deji:😐 Alex:😁
why this sound like asmr... at least there civil about it
Alex reminds me of a biological woman who is transitioning to male.
I can already tell they’re going to be friends after this fight
Deji got this, he put in the work. Nd this new deji is better less talking more working
Is this a podcast or face to face
I think that if this fight turns into a back-and-forth war and it’s a close decision…if Alex wins, Deji may see that & fight again because of the close outcome. This could very well be a rematch.
This is the worse face to face I’ve seen
They shud kiss
deji deji deji deji deji deji!!!! deji wins
I can tell by Alex speech and body language he’s nervous
Wanna see wassabi get smacked just because it would make this face off funny
DEJI U GOT THIS !!!!
Deji gonna turn Alex Wasabi into Alex Guacamole
Look, I want Deji to win. But honestly he is known for talking the talking, but not walking the walk. He asks Wassabi if he has knockout power and says that he is knocking people out. I mean Deji just said he was sparring with pros. Like is Vinnie Hacker then better than the pros hahaha. Deji couldn't even beat a guy who shakes his ass for a living. I mean I love Deji, but honestly (even if he wins) if he looks bad in the ring, he should quit boxing and just STFU. Tbh I don't even think Deji looks in good shape. I mean he lost weight, but there is no muscles. All talk man!
16:50 Deji caught the guy in 4K 📸😂
This is dope
NGL, Alex seemed skittish,  kinda nervous. He wasn't here as Deji's opponent, he was talking like he was a friend.
im WAITING for the fight to happen, come on deji, you can do this!
I’m sorry I’m already 2 mins into this and they’re just fighting for the sake of nothing…😂 What’s happened to Boxing😂😂 Youtubers doing this sort of thing is just weird, I regret viewing this
Man i dont wanna see wasabi get beat up now hes too nice 😂😂😂😂
Deji please train rlly hard I need you to win
Why is Wannabe acting like he didn't get knocked out by FouseyTube😂😂
Damn Straight
this is so wholesome
Cringe
The presenter sounds exactly like the guy from dragons den and diary of a CEO 🤯
Can't wait
When Alex tounged his cheek was so disturbing
lets go dejiii. also respect to alex he is humble and respectfull. but still team deji for the w
Alex is playing mind games but are boy DEJI is serious and doesn’t look like he’s falling for the mind games
I love how humble they were
thats a new podcast ngl
I love it
Nice to see Sebastian Stan hosting this face 2 face
3:23  Period.
Deji you will lose ik that
You could tell Dejis trying to play it up which makes sense that’s how you sell a fight the drama but Alex is having none of it he just wants to fight and be done with lmao
Bout time Dej… prove yourself finally
Respect for both for taking it serious let’s go Deji bring the W we’re all wishing you the best luck you got this mate.
Alex smile 😂😩😩😩
The moderator keeps on re-asking the same questions
Hopefully Deji brings home the W🔥
Deji for the win!!! 🏆 🙌🏾 💪🏾 ✊🏾🥊🥊🥊  Alex wasteman is going done him and his soft voice.
I honestly dont think wasabi underestimated deji
3 days until deji's domination come back W LETS WIN THIS DEJI WE ALL GOT YOUR BACK
19:42 alex looks nervous when deji mentions I’m not learning to box
Bruh this was so awkward lmao
We’re only exited to see this because Deji hasent won yet
Wasabi was quite respectful
Deji ❤️
This shit was awkward
Deji took the face 2 face very steady and serious, really proud and i hope Deji gets his redemption win
ديجي عيب عليك اذا متفوز يعني مابيها اي مجال لازم تفوز
This is not a face 2 face this is just a casual talk lol
im happy that there is an element of respect and knowledge here. i find it so petty when they dont talk about boxing and instead are like hes just an ugly prick yk. i dont give a shit. u dont have to hate the person ur fighting
this is so fucking awkward
love you champ
Deji we're with you!
Deji stared him down the whole talk. Liking the confidence
Alex in Face 2 Face: 🕺🏻   Deji in Face 2 Face: 🧍🏾
Why the fuck is this asmr?
I really want Deji to win but not sure after the last two
You can tell by Alex’s body language he’s nervous
If Alex wins, 1 million kids in africa dies
Deji deji deji deji deji deji deji deji
Dejis boxing career is how I’ve been with my gcses ahhah
What's this soft speaking licking lips stuff
I’m rooting for deji because I’m team uk but I’m hoping Alex dose his best to cause both were apart of my childhood❤️🙏🏾
I hope deji wins 🙏🐐
If Deji loses to wasabi u will melt 😭
1:08 Respect.
This was a 2 on 1
Nah bruh Deji definitely has paid Alex to take the fall lol
The hardest working person in the room always thinks he’s the laziest 💯
This seems so awkward
Wtf is this a podcast
Deji should only prove to himself rather than proving to the rest of the world because that will boost up his confidence
im 2 mins in and it feels like these guys are moments away from kissing each other lmao The sexual tension between these 2 is off the charts XD
An awkward face2face, there was no believable tension here.
Man asked the same questions over and over
This is basically a friendly conversation with mild threats at most
Deji hast to win this fight🙏🏼
I have no knowledge of this
Alex seems like such a cool dude but dej take his head off!
"Oh so you're learning combinations?" "Yeah, are you not?"  "I'm learning to box." MAN'S A CERTIFIED TROLL 😂😂😂😂
“You’re practicing ring walks, what do you mean what do I mean?”  😂😂
Alex is gonna shock the world
DEJI LOOK SO SERIOUS MAN.
wtf was this face-off
Pretty bad trashtalk tbh Deji
DEJI you gotta win my boy! One last change.
Damn, Alex is 31, thought he was 21 or something!
they are talking like friends lol
Yo imagine if Deji loses 😂😂😂 I wonder what’s he’s gon say
This way too nice
i cant wait to hear that deji won or alex, yes NOT watching :(
Deji looks like them evil character from a cartoon  Wasabi looks shook icl😭😭😭😭😭
fighting somebody that has a dead youtube channel. istg if deji don't win this shit thats a new low
alex has a neck
Wtf is going on 😂😂
Is it me or does alex seem feminine. 😭
I love how much respect they have for eachother
Alex is a good guy icl
Now Deji u gotta beat him.
In the past i had no respect for alex he was just cocky and annoying but at the same time scared to back up his talk. Seing him now its like 2 diferent people you have to give him respect for how much hes changed for the better.
Man deji if u don’t beat this bum🤦‍♂️
Deji looks like an actual fighter now  mad respect for the effort
Let’s go Deji you can do this
if deji loses fousey would clown him
I'm predicting deji to take a knee again. Everybody laughing at him and then has cheeky anine smile. Jumps up then uppercut his ass flat out.
I like how their chairs are backwards
They are talking like they are friends lol 😂
Ngl deji is get pushed around
I wouldn't be surprised if deji loses.
I like Deji but nobody should be bragging about knocking out sparring partners. Pro's don't do it and neither should you.
wassabi literally doing ASMR
I actually think Alex is a nice guy
Deji don't embarrass yourself
Why they complimenting each other
This feels like friends who haven't seen each other in years and are catching up 🤣🤣
Deji get a fresh fade for your next fight
Deji is reading the hell out of Alex.
This face off is so boring
Is this the same night as Ufc?
>Lack of confidence >Underestimating me  🤔
The level of respect between these two Is just great to see
This felt uncomfortable watching
Honestly I thought Alex wassabi would come prepared with some trash talks.... But instead both respected each other let each other talk.... And they both listened. Respect to both...
20:32 bees be like
Props to Alex for being humble and respectful, you can tell he really doesn't deserve the hate.
Alot of fighters train for 6 weeks, you don't want to train for too long and then you get injured, it's better that he changes camp and pushing himself rather than not changing his camp and realising in the ring on fight night that he hasn't pushed himself, good luck deji. God is with you.
There's zero chance that Alex didn't go home after this and get mounted by his bf, zero chance
ngl its hella hard to watch these
Cmon deji i watched your fights since jake and vinnie but im still here rooting for you to win ❤️💪
Looking at deji he seems focused and looks aggressive/mean reckon Alex is in for a world of trouble Saturday night
Did they really went on a date before the fight
i’m not gonna lie it seems like alex is tryna make friends with deji he was like no way u lost all that weight that’s amazing bru stop that
Deji 🔥🔥
Deji tryna act like he’s won his last 2 fights lmao
They seem like friends tf
I’m cringinggg
Alex is too nice😂
I can’t wait for Deji to win
I am a Boxing Trainer 🥊 and Personal Trainer. I upload Boxing videos on my YouTube channel 👀
when he said ''what pros have u fought'' alex was scared
Alex pretends as if Deji hasn’t vastly improved since the Vinnie fight, and Alex forgets he has a glass jaw.
0 care from Deji, no fear. Alex looked uncomfortable, laughing, smiling, fidgeting constantly. Blokes getting sparked.
They're just having a chat 😂
I like alex now. 😍😍😍
Deji not being loud & obnoxious suits him so much, spark him Deji
wtf is this
Lol Alex is a tosser
You can see the nervousness on Alex's face.i think Deji will get the W🔥
This was so chill 🌌🌌👌
Anyone has ko power as long as it lands flush on that chin the question should have been "do you have a chin"
7:30 “i don’t watch your videos” got me dead🤣
Ima be honest no one really care but good luck
It's nice seeing a calm deji more level headed
omg kiss already!
This isn't a face off it's just a normal conversation 🤣
Alex is so wholesome
Alex By KO.
Deji lost boiis
Come on Deji we're all behind you on this show the world who you are
respect for eachother lmao
Dude is 31???!!!?? Damn alex
Do u wanna fight now 💀 deji is a menace  Go deji win this for us💫 Make us proud deji u got this
Respect to both for being mature, I’m with deji here though bring that W home to the UK
I’m rooting for Deji but seeing how hyped Alex is for the fight just gets me hyped too.
Deji confidence is like when goku arrives on the nemek planet to fight freeza. Deji is gonna win, it’s gonna be a tough fight but all Deji previous fights he’s had his opponents on the run and then he ran out of stamina. But his mind is in the game now
If deji loses this ima lose all respect for this man
Sorry to say but deji going to lose
The most kind face to face ever 🤣🤣 sounds like the boys conversation after half term 🤣
Shit show 😑
This looked like a try not to laugh more than a face off🤣
i feel like they can be mates
Cmon deji u got this fight
would actually be sad af if Alex were to end Deji's boxing career in his own home, let's hope deji's work ethic backs him up on sat
Honestly don’t see deji losing. I know he lost 2 in a row but even though he lost the last fight. He wasn’t doing that bad. Just gassed
May Allah let Deji win this match against Alex Wassabi.
Goodluck to both fighters especially deji.
Alex makes a good point at 8:28
Fucking jokes of a face to face
3 days to go, let's get that W, dej
This video was very telling if you ask me, you can just see the confidence in Dej's face and how Alex just looks like he isn't taking this seriously for some reason.
They needa stop this ain't no real boxing 🤣
Deji ngl you tried to be intimidating but the vibe was different , should have went with it
respect to both tbh alex wasnt as childish as i thought he was gonna be cmon deji i believe
Fun fact: Alex Wasabi is older than Canelo by 3-4 months
Deji you have the mentality, discipline to go 24/7, you’ve seen negatives of being in a that ring knowing it’s either win or defeat use it to your advantage let your work to show you won’t accept defeat prove yourself
I feel like Deji sees his old self in Alex when he asks him questions.
Alex is a Nice guy, respect mate
Alex Wassabi is a good person but that evil smile tho🤭😂😂😈
not gonna lie alex looks nervous he was moving a lot in that chair and sometimes would even look nervous while deji is still and having a death stare on alex so lets go deji you got this
Good luck to both dnt care who wins tbf
Alex is shook
Deji gonna lose again sadly
Do you hear this mf voice helium voice
You got this Deji!
Alex: Deji looks confident. I'm gonna fight the real Deji.  Deji: You're underestimating me. Alex:😐
Holy shit, Alex is oozing nervousness and uncertainty, who says “if you had your coach earlier you would beat me”?! Alex should have no doubt no matter how much training his opponent could do he will always prevail to get the W. Instead he’s fidgeting around for 20 mins thinking he can’t wait to get out of this interview and go home. This is an easy W for Deji
You can tell by the way that Alex talks ,that he's scared.
Weak
So if deji wins or loses he's not boxing again?
i like how Alex is being as friendly as he can hoping that Deji eases up a bit when they fight xD
Alex is a nice guy man wtf thought he was a dick
Deji lost 40 pound tf
This just a causal convo lol
Let’s go alexx 🙌💪
Deji is a man of focus commitment and sheer forking will
These lot really talking like their friends 😂😂😂😂
I hope DEJI wins
I can’t figure it out. Is the dude interviewing the guy from Ted
Cmon dej
Deji is right when talking about the period where he pushed his own content and people watched him. We all love Deji, i hope he wins
Deji was silently violating all the time 💀
Man said “i don’t watch your videos so I wouldn’t know”
we love you dejii
Alex just trying to get in his head
Nice to see that they are both calm
sweet talks no face to face >_<
Watch this be a draw
Deji you and your brothers content has been a contributor making a lot of people's day better I don't know if youll ever see my comment in particular but  I just want to let you know as a fan I don't care about hearing how committed you are I want you to make your family and fans proud I'm going to watch the press conference So fuck all this talking We believe in you go smash that mother fuckers face in  Violently take all your insecurities out on him in that ring and get that fucking W less talk more violence 😈😈👿👿😤😤😤💯💯💯
Go deji ! My dog is rooting for you 🐕
well, this is rather romantic ngl
The interviewer is very very respectable and you can tell he's a class act.
on ogus twenny fif we'll see
Let’s go DEJI !!!
My Jaw dropped when I heard the weight loss like we defo saw his lost weight but Not THAT much frr am so proud to be Team Deji
I'm only 3 mins in and I feel like I'm just watching two friends/rivals talk, it doesn't feel like there is any tension but obv it might change later, I cba to watch it tho lol
Man, if you compare this, to when he did this with Jake Paul, he has matured so much, really hope he pulls through with the W.
I actually can't wait for this, Team Deji
Come on Dej! 🔥💪🏼
ALEX IF YOUR READING THIS IF YOU WIN IM NEXT, bring someone who’s not famous into the light
Alex Wassbi's Uncle Phil neck rolls need to be nerfed, those things got at least 15 pounds of solid muscle behind them.
i guese nobody is rooting for alex  lol
We all love the competitive face offs but honestly I didn’t mind this at all. No fake personalities 💯💯
Ayo Deji, You seem much more confident now. I know you will win. Big up to both fighters :D
When is alex finna hit puberty yet???🤔
WAIT STOP✝️ITS NOT TO LATE TO TURN TO GOD BUT SOON IT WILL BE✝️YOU’RE NOT PROMISED TOMORROW REPENT AND SPREAD THE GOSPEL AND PRAY 🙏
Respect to Alex for his respect for deji and his proper manners … but I’m rooting for Deji but good luck to you Alex 💯💯
🤣🤣🤣🤣 deji is fucking this guy up
Alex good luck your gonna need it lad
I, honestly, just want a great fight. I don't care who wins, I just wanna see a great fight. Good luck Deji (rooting for you)! ;)
You can tell that Alex is like Deji before his last two fights. He is over confident and underestimating Deji. Deji is gonna win easily.
Great conversation
respect to both of them GASSED FOR THE FIGHT
Deji got this
DEJI IM SENDING YOU MY ENERGY! YOU GOT THIS!!🥊💫
This is so cringe 😬
Dejis smugness is actually worrying me. He had the same attitude for his previous fights now it seems like he hasn't learned.
can we all appreciate that Deji squared upto Alex, and Alex looked at the Moderator for help hahahahhahahaha
Team Alex
Respect to both
This is just watching deji and Alex having a regular conversation XD
this gotta be the worst face to face ever 😂
Respect for Alex... but why you sounds like ur balls ain't drop yet..
were the fuck is all the trash talk from wassabi. this face 2 face was lame. sorry to say it but, i don´t feel that hyped for this boxing match. but i still watch it because its deji
I hope deji wins. Deji you got this
Man idk man dejis been confident bf and loss I feel like he’s gonna lose hope he wins tho
Deji on top baby
LMAOOO...idk what wassabi thinks this is but hes a clown😂
Anyone else think that Alex’s voice is so jarring?
Fam y tf does alex seem like a good mans
who's even on alex's side? like nobody likes him. but he's good.
Deji looks good on the pads and sparring but on fight night it all goes out the window.
Alex stretching trying to intimidate 😂
Alex won this
You net to get back together with  your ex men I miss your videos together
Alex has good movement but Deji got strength
Man said “do you want to fight now” 😭😭😭
I support Deji once again. All I’m scared about is Alex trained for 4months.
The weighins are gonna show the true winner in this fight.
Deji please beat the absolute african out of him! he seems SUPER confident
So is this a fight or a date???
This is so awkward
If Alex won deji would be the biggest meme of 2022
I don’t wanna think it but I feel like Deji is gonna lose… I HOPE HE WINS COME ON TANK!
I would think it's funny if Alex won
Nahhhh don't do that team USA vs UK
Gg I can tell Alex is scared
I love deji but alex is a nice guy and he respects the sport and degi so it's gonna be a fair fight
deji dont lose
Alex is gonna slap this man around lol
17:22 bs
They both have respect 👍🏻👍🏻
I wish it was me taking the fight against DEJI ! I’m coming this year
This is shite
What is this
Alex Wapussy looks kinda different, but Deji is gonna slap this guy
it’s gonna go unanimous decision maybe deji
Alex gotta hook deji up w his barber his cut clean ash 💯
If deji lose I swear
😤I’m bringing a belt along. Deji u better not lose thing fight or u getting whipped. I’m believing in u once again.
Blud if you lose. Your getting back in the ring. Idc. Until someone actually gets you to smoke someone. My guy deji yana
why is this shit sooo soft!!!!!,  My man Alex be talking to Deji like he bout to seduce  him and hit that bunda... Kinda Sus bruv😂😂😂
Cringe the whole way
“Damn you lost like 40 pounds… thats a lot… that’s good.”
Its official.
Good face-off but Deji u better win
deji looks maaddd fam
Who else got reminded when he said we will see March 5th of his last face to face with Jake when he said oRgUST twonty fiF
deji cares more about fighting more than the win that to shows me  he is a true fighter
If deji doesnt win this fight i dont think he should box again but i still believe in deji
From what I've seen Alex is a nice guy
Deji if you lose just hang up the gloves😂😂
Deji was serious the whole time and wassabi was acting cool lmao, interesting
Such a great date they’re having
Face 2 face, now we escalatin'
Deji is commited, ready and focused. He has trained hard and lost a lot of weight and is more than ready to win this fight. On the other side you got Wasabi, a dude who trained a lot but to me looks scared, isn't confident and will lose...
Dejis too cocky it’s gonna be funny asf when he looses
I guess Alex was not so shabby
Alex is such a weird guy it’s like he’s flirting with deji when suppose to be warring with him. Where’s the attitude at ma boi
Deji, you're not gonna see this today nor will you see it days after the fight, cuz I know you're grinding and you'll be celebrating with your mates. But on the 5th of March, I'll be on a bike trip (like I always do) and I'll be pushing myself to cycle for as long as I can without breaks. And that's me wanting you to get a W. I'll be cheering you on, bruv.  Edit: I guess I didn't go that far as I thought I did, cuz Deji lost.
Deji > Alex
Deji had one sparring partner?
Rooting for Deji, but I feel like Alex wasabi is going to whoop his ass tbh
I’ve never seen any of Alex’s videos before, but he seems like a nice guy. This fight could go either way, but it’s cool to hear Deji has lost so much weight and taken on the challenge fully.
Deji was alot more stable and relaxed than alex i think alex is not sure of himself
LETS GO KING 🤴
so cringe lol
Good luck to the both of you ❤️
My face when deji said 77kg😅😅😅😅 i was so happy and proud to hear
Okay, I’m invested in this so think I’ll be paying to watch it live. At least it’s on UK time for once! I’ve no idea who is on the undercard 🤷‍♂️
is it only me or these 2 acting like friends but for this they r acting like well that
Idk man. Alex’s whole demeanor is fighting with nothing to lose, scary to me.
that was very passive aggressive. haha.
Hey deji if you see this comment i hope you win and i respect how you talked to alex with respect and it was very nice to see.
I don’t know if they are mates or they are actually going to fight 😂. This is too friendly for a face 2 face
Alex looks very nervous. can't even look Deji in his eyes.
This convo sounds look group therapy. It’s so calming 😂
Just brought the PPV im excited to see, I think Deji is gonna take the W.
This video made me install an adblock Jesus Christ!
I do want Deji to win but Alex seems quite chill i think he'll be better than people think ngl should be a good fight.
The irony, the amount of people in the comments saying Deji is acting tough. Tryna be the tough guy, dude that's all of you little gremlins on the internet in all the comment threads. At least deji has put actual work in and is backing it up and is doing it to Alex's face. Stfu 😂
This is closer to a conversation with your mate lmao
This is terrible
Ayo I got mad respect for Alex after this man🙌✊
Deji lost 16kg respect
This is gonnna go Crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just realized Deji hasn't been wearing his glasses anymore
31 years old????
Big up deji in the chats
Those niggas are were about to be friends
I mean there’s a big difference between confidence and arrogance and i think alex is being too arrogant
Deji is 77 KG now!? And he was 93 KG before???! We get to see the actual natural athletic Deji
Deji doesn’t sound up for this one bit.
Let's GO DEJI!!!!!
Alex is more respectful than Demi
Alex Wasabi is about to shock the world on Saturday night!
I really just don’t feel real hatred between the two so it just kind of feels awkward watching them talk here, also Alex is really cringe here just because of his voice sorry I liked him when I was a kid but now…
I respect alex for taking this but the best outcome is for deji to win and alex lose. Then alex can get redemption in another fight. But respect to both. Good luck dej.
Deji don't underestimate him!! Give it your all! You've got this 💪
Alex waffle is elite!
I hate how soft Alex is. I really wish he had an aggressive dog like attitude. There will be no knockout. Deji will get his hand raised in his hometown cuz his fat ass made it all 3 rounds or how ever long their fighting .
Don’t underestimate Alex he’s a fighter he can box soo good
Deji acting like he’s an anime character lmao
Great to see that Alex isn't a trash talker🙏💯
Alex sounds beta
You'll lose broda
When dejis voice get so deep 😂😂
Why can’t they sit in the chair like normal people do
1:41 What’s the deal with people saying they “train every single day”??? Your body can’t adapt
Alex> vinnie hacker
boring af. would be better if they roasted each other more
“You wanna fight now” had me on my feet, the confidence Deji has now is just amazing to see. We all believe in you. Bring this W home Deji we love you.
this is deji’s last chance to redeem himself but if he loses,  it’s over.
LETS GOOOOOOO
You're going to win the fight deji  I know
21:07 Alex wassabi swallowing 😂
Deji will destory this man on saturday. He has lost the weight so i believe in him! lets go tank!!!
so gassed for this fight, deji looks so calm and you can just tell alexs movement and expressions are showing some fear
deji is loosing bra🤦🏼‍♀️smh
I strongly believe that alex is underestimating deji from what hes seen and deji is overestimating alex from what he hasnt seen within good reason. I believe deji will win this if hes truly dedicated snd the look in his eye shows he is determined
im gonna shock the world
I’m more invested in this than any previous YouTube boxing fights
The ASMR 💀
Alex looks out of place today
Deji has to win this. Surely.
just a friendly chat
Let’s go Alex!!
This was nice to see, respectful comments. Good shit.
Why they sitting in their chairs backwards?
Deji's got it this time, we on your back legend❤
It’s kinda cringe seeing deji tryna be tough while Alex is being nice lol
This lowkey feels like a first date
deji was trying to bring in a cold eerie demeanor but alex was being nice and smiley the entire time lmao. may the best man win march the 5th
GO ON DEJ
So chill lol
Wasabi earned my respect with this one
7:32 Man's violating 🤣
Sebastian Stan?!
There is somethin about Deji. He is something else. Much respect.
deji is confident, I like it
One thing I’ve noticed abt Alex wasabi is that he looks less and less Asian every year😂
deji is loosing ...siad it here first
"You wanna fight now" 🤣
Man, it's so funny how Deji is trying to be this tough guy, and then Alex just pulls all the air out of the Insults by being so nice. Lol
Don’t let him butter you up Deji. That’s the enemy.
They’re actually flirting
I was never willing to pay for a YT boxing fight. However I will be buying this one. The respect is amazing.
the fact that dej said the era people leave out (2014-2016) is when he pushed himself means that he'll make some BANGERS soon. excited
Deji didnt train the mental part to becoming a boxer and learning the sport thats why alex done the ring walk and was actually surprised that deji had 1 sparing partner alex is breaking down deji and now has full confidence in his fighting abilities he has already won the fight thats why press conference like these make or break fights
I agree deji if you lose your should and has and have got to stop
You’ll lose again and I won’t be surprised
Alex voice gets me every time I get surprised every time he sounds like a kid
deez niggas is friendly asl😂😂
They don’t have to yell but like why are they whispering Also Alex looking for a whole lotta gratification
but i still support dejsss
i respect alex but i am rooting for deji
i think deji is goin fully over confident on this one even tho he tranined hard
Deji seems very confident whereas Alex keep smiling because he is anxious but hopefully it’s gonna be good fight and deji can win! Otherwise it’s gonna be a stinker for uk again!
I thought you deji don’t take any Ls
Deji calling Alex put for acting like a big shot Deji did fight 2 time but he had is ass wiped in both of them  I want him to win but I got a feeling that it's going to happen again
Deji was being a lil rude but Wassabi was being so nice
i cannot take ya'll seriously lmfaooo
Huge respect for deji and Alex, confident deji will bring home that W🙌🏿
This is so awkward cause Deji don’t want to talk cause he knows that it is what he has done before and he doesn’t want to go with the same approach
Deji's face is just "look at this clown"
Deji said he's been in the middle of the stage on not ring 😂 He really going to put on a show for everyone!
MARCH FIFFF
Alex is a really nice person but deji is more prepared for this fight
Honestly it’s Team KG vs Team Pounds
Deji talking like we didn't just see him quit literally took a knee in the middle of a round because he was gassed
Alex is so unsure about everything going on😂
Alex Is so calm and focused. Mark my words. He will take the victory ✌🏽
the calmest face off ever!
DEJI TALKIN TALK YOU BETTER BACK IT UP IM ROOTIN FOR YOU
Deji sitting there talking like he isn’t the laughing stock of YouTube boxing.
hoos periud blud are ya waring
Is it just me or was Alex way too nice?
yo, i mean, i know dehi lose 2 times. but i will be suprised if deji lose against alex. alex is not confidence  at all
Nice to see Sebastian Stan cross over to boxing
How is Alex 31, he looks so young. Thought he was 21.
Good luck to the both of them, this might be Deji's most fair fight.
These man are just having a catch up
alex is lacking confidence, you can feel it through the screen.
Alex seems like a nice guy. At first Deji was abit standoff-ish but Alex disarmed that with being humble and charming. If Deji loses then I think he should remove his channel
Is it me or why does it feel like alex is the guy asking questions wtf so weird
The American dude looks annoying
He really said that if he lose this fight, this will be the end
I hope Alex wins soooooo bad!!! He has always been underestimated!
Another pointless nerd fight
alex shat himself he was moving his headl left and right up and down itching his head pure stress
if the match ends by decision deji wins but if it ends by ko/tko wassabi wins......siad it here first
20:51 Alex looking at host the like save me please 💀💀
I don’t really care who wins but I have a bad feeling that deji will lose
Alex is 31?!?
2:36   WhAt wOuLd yOu GiVe mE
💪
This was so awkward
before this fight will there be a weigh in like with vinne and deji?
You got this deji👌
yo this is the most passive face 2 face ive seen hahahaha
Wasabi kid acting like he’s got a 20-0 record never lost , and deji acting like he’s been in wars and has a 15-11 record but neither guy has won a fight 😂
This is the weirdest face to face I’ve ever watched lol💀
I enjoyed this face off, it was so calm
They are so calm it’s scary🙁
Deji i wanna route for you but all the other times i did you’ve let me down and Alex has some promise i want you to win but i don’t have as much faith as before  BUT BRING HOME THE W
Alex seems like the kinda person u jus can,t hate cause he jus to nice😂😂
Please 🙏 God let deji win 🏆
Looks like Deji may be underestimating Alex a little hopefully not and he can pull off the win
Face to face. No dumb insults, no yelling and each guy trying to scream over the other. Just talk. Good talk.
The hat and hoodie combo makes Deji look like a mushroom is hilarious
Alex wassabi is voiding his look tells a lot.Go deji you can remove that smile for good
Friendliest face2face
I've seen 3 minutes of it, do I bother continuing? It really looks like they both don't really want to fight but Deji feels cornered in his life a little and feels like he needs to do this. Regardless, hopefully it's a decent fight and they both get paid.
You got this deji we believe in you
Deji is gonna lose
I haven't seen much of Alex before but he seems like a chill person, he was so respectful in this face off,   I think Deji will win this.
I dont really watch deji amymore but i used to watch him all the time and i can tell he needs this win. I need it for him too man. Loved this guy when i was younger and to see him lose its just painful. GET THAT WIN DEJ ❤️❤️ push that 🅿️
I can’t lie I wish Deji wasn’t as responsive to Alex’s questions that would have ruined Alex’s mental, I feel he should have been more stone dead short and snappy and just on pure go
I can see the respect between the tbh
DEJIs Redemption incoming
this is the most sensual face 2 face i'd say
hit em up deji💪
these mfs just having a conversation lmao
This is gonna be good, respectful fighters, strong fellas with huge hearts and they want that W, my money is on deji hope he gets his redemption. I’m excited
This is the cutest face 2 face i’ve ever seen
I think Alex will win.       I *want* to be disappointed.
See this fights gonna be good I feel like they’re gonna come out of the fight with respect for each other although I want deji to win I do like Alex’s character
Oh fuck, get a room already
Finally deji will take a W!, No Ls xD
these man bussing a whole conversation 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cmon now we not gonna talk bout how Alex is the most chattiest over confident and deji is calm and not chattin
what’s he stretching for. he keeps acting like some junkie what’s wrong w him
Deji is literally roasting himself everytime he is trying to roast Alex 😂 Tryna  come at him saying his channel is dead, yes that is true, But Deji, your channel is just as dead! Without this boxing thing you channel would be underground! Deji does NOT deserve to win this.
Deji is gonna fuc* him up
22:01 gay dudes be like
I acc don't know who is going to win they both seem the same level
imagine all this hype and then wassabi just gets knocked out with just one punch lmao
Are we able to bet on this anywhere?
31??? I thought he was 21
This is the gayest face 2 face
bruhhhh he fighting Alex Wassabi😂
Deji was not going hard enough and eating when he shouldn’t
Man I hope this fight is good
Nicest face 2 face I've seen lmao
Wasabi about to destroy deji
Why tf is alex so nice.
Deji take this W
This interview is seriously the weirdest and most uncomfortable i have ever watched feels like i am watching two gay people wanting to smash but having second thoughts
Alex is scared as f
first 3 mins in and it’s the nicest face to face ahahaha i’m just smiling watching them casually talk about their progress🤣🤣
Hahahha deji wants to be like Jake Paul when they had their face to face
Icl I respect Alex wasabi. I’m team DEJI but he was very humble and appreciated the hard work DEJI has put in 🥊
Wait.... Alex Wassabi is 31?😲 I thought he is like 26-27.😂
Alex is gonna whip him lol
you got this twin
This face 2 face feels like a therapy session for deji
Why tf is Alex’s face so punchable
This face off is child friendly
COME ON DEJI BEAT HIM
Alex such a nice guy, Deji staying same attitude as before every fight.. holy shit if you lose this fight....
Deji taking shots at Alex's channel dying killed me lmao.
Mate the way they’re talking is like they’re going to jump up and kiss each other.
Alex got knocked down by a guy that defends punches with his face i reckon Deji will win easily
Why they sitting like that? So impractical
this is the tamest shit i've ever seen for a face2face, but i'd prefer it over the fake cringey shit
10k ppv
Jake Paul 🐐 still haunts him
Its really just deji answering everything and alex trying to find out who has a bigger winning chance lmao
alex is too chilled deji is gunna destroy him. im gunna bet 1k on deji to win
Can’t wait for niko to break in the fight
here can i watch the fight
I believe deji has  got this , and  he will do it this time
Let’s go DEJI💯💯
Both men have intimidating seating tactics. What I wanna know is who sat down like that first.
Which gloves they are using?
This was entertaining
Damn this was kind of wholesome lol
I feel like Alex just had no idea what to respond with when confronted about any type of boxing situation
Alex in this interview is the best version of someone who wants to "play boxing" It isn't gonna work.
This was actually such a cool face to face. They both looked like they were respecting each other. It doesn't sell a fight(no drama) but no matter the outcome I admire them both.
Ayyyy. You have got this Deji
so nobody in the comments gon comment on how deji pressed alex at like 20:24 LMFOAOAOA “u wanna fight right now?” my son was ready to run the fade fr
it's nice to see bucky mediating the face-to-face
Alex getting the nerves and has to crack his neck every minute
Deji don't lose
Im seeing Alex win this one. If Alex is smart enough hell know how to break down this dude. It won't be hard
Alex is funny and he is scared
Let's gooo
After all the high-tension Face 2 Faces I've seen, two guys just having a chill conversation is so jarring lmao.
How NOT to sell a fight 😂
stop sniggering at  each other. this is so bent.  icl deji can’t after this
they are gonna become friends
"You're learning combinations? Heh I'm learning to box" DEJI'S A MUHFUCKIN BADASSSS  Let's go ma boi, knock the fucker out
Alex has never had a pro fight before. If deji loses thats embarrassing af
is this a date or a face to face?
fucking hell alex is gonna get destroyed
IS THIS A DATE?
The closer’s the fight get the more my heart beat. Like I’m the one fighting 😂🤣
Alex is stressed out👶
Alex soundin like Michael Jackson 💀
Deji please stop putting on this cringy tough guy act, we all know what youre like, in my opinion Alex made you look silly by being the bigger more respectful man while you sit there and try to subtly disrespect him, you cant say shit about him yet, you havent won a fight so clearly youre not doing it right, still rooting for team UK though
Its like FaceTiming early in the morning
Bring home that W Deji you got this we’re all rooting for you!
Alex just happy to be there. He actually seems pretty excited. Gonna be a good fight
Both r so kind they cannot be mean to each other 🤣🤣🤣it's gonna be a friendly match.... Interesting... N excited
these 2 are literally nice to each other 😂
DEJI
This is way too soft wtf
Deji is definitely winning this fight. Deji has a lot more to prove than Alex. Deji lost 2 fights but at least has the experience compared to Alex who it's his first fight.
This is the gayest face to face I’ve seen. Are they gonna kiss
Deji cardio madr Jake Paul a star
To be honest alex is scared
Cutee face to face😂❣️
I feel this is gonna be a really good fight, I might be biased to deji, but I genuinely think he'll win, Alex seems a bit cocky, and I can see the confidence in Dej's eyes and face
Deji with this atitude you will lose how can u switch camps ... man wasabi is shit but he will win this im sorry ... deji simply isnt made for the sport boxing and the sacrifices you have to made to reach a good level
Deji is so full of shit. This was so crindgey. He was waffling all the way through man
If he says “I’m gonna shock the world” I swear to god
If deji gets a trim for this fight it’s a guaranteed win
Alex is nice and respectful but in my opinion he is and will always be a clown 🤡
Deji gonna get put on his neck if he doesn’t t up..
This was such a nice and calm face off like hats off to both of them for respecting eachother man, that was really heartwarming to watch at the end of the day both the fighters have trained hard to reach where they are so you gotta give them respect👍 Rooting for you Deji and good luck Alex
TANK FTW
I expected shit talk not seeing 2 kids meeting at the camp
Deji on attack mood got that nigga looking left and right lmaooo
Why’s Alex tryna seduce deji?
This was the most awkward thing I’ve ever seen
Come on deji you know what you need to do get that W💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
You can tell this guy knows nothing about either of them  should have got Johnny nelson or Hawaii not this amateur
DEJI FOR THE FUCKING WIN
Man they're too sweet
COMON MEN
Redemption
Worst main card ever
Deji is really ready to be 0-3
Let’s goooo Dejiiii
Deji lookin scary
I’m team Deji but Alex did compose himself even when Deji was pressuring him
I could see these two being friends lmao…
wassabi not looking at dejis face is the funniest thing
OH SHIT HERE WE GO
Dj u are going 2 kill him
Looking foward to the weigh in
This is proof that boxing doesn't have to be an extreme rivalry to be entertaining or interesting.
deji needs to win this fight so he can come back to youtube after the fight and maybe start streaming again
Go Alex
2 of my favourite YouTubers while growing up I can’t wait for this fight
Am I the only one who thinks Alex is going to win
comon men
wasabi acting nervous, fidgeting, smiling, and not acting confident
Deji and Alex don’t wanna talk. They just wanna show what they can do.
he’s 31 wtf
Round 3 or 4 stoppage win to Deji I'm guessing
Hee-hee
You can do it deji
they give me gay vibes and just wanted to kiss after the face 2 face
No one have ever seen Alex this serious
why are they so nice lmao
Deji - 😐 Alex Wassabi - 😀
if alex has only gone up a few punds he comfortable with his weigh and been training at it for long and dejis worked 2x to get to that weight and train at that weight so i hope deji wins but idk last deji fight wasnt anywhere near i thought itd be.
Man is it me or wessabi really look like mardona
This is the funniest stare down i've ever seen in my life.
they give gay vibes
U got this deji
19:13 is defo cap u cant knock som1 out in sparring and if so mans got power like mike tyson
Super respectful to each other, very nice
Can you hear the nervousness in Wassabis voice? Man this little kid going to get rocked 🤣
there he gos with the "well see march 5th" just like with Jake Paul "august 25th" LMAO
i cant take alex seriously 😂 all i see is the rolanda and richard video
This is so cute not what I expected. Love it!
I think Alex was genuinely dissapointed deji said he would stop boxing if he lost
Let’s go deji
Deji bout to pop off in this fight 💪🏽
I respect both fighters but alex is shitting him self
23:43 they definitely gonna party together after their fight, u can tell they gonna be friends after no bad blood
I like deji a lot but I don’t think this fight is fair cause deji has had experience, yea he might have not won any of the fights but still enough to win this fight. It’s a dead give away that deji will win! If anything he should’ve fight Bryce hall or had a rematch w vinny! Someone w at least a fight under their name.
Everytime one topic ends Wassabi says ”lessgoooo😏”
Deji will win👍
five minutes in I am thinking this a date
Sorry deji. Wasabi looks toooo tooooo confident champion
The most wholesome video I’ve ever seen
Good to see they respect eachother
This is more of a date than a face 2 face but I am team deji and going for the win
why does wassabi sound like michael jackson
this feels like a therapy session lmfao
Alex is so nice
Hats off to both of them but Deji has that hunger boiis a right hook from Deji will drop Alex boiis watch
Wtf are you doing in boxing gym that makes you think that your shoulder is going to break? Alex is full of shit 🤦🏻‍♂️
tbh all this youtube boxing sh it is acc a joke to the boxing community just the way its presented like there acc real boxers makes me laugh and deji rating jake a 8 or 9 on boxing skill jus shows what a complete joke it is
The Wasabi dude literally doesn't know any technical terms in boxing 🤔
I’m pretty surprised they didn’t kiss at some point
Most calm Face 2 face to be existed. Lets Go Deji.
i don’t think no one seen deji this ready for a fight
bruh why's this so cringeeee
This is a friendly conversation more than a face to face
Got to respect Alex. Seems like a nice guy to be honest
Go wasabi! Good luck bra. Do a favour for your mate fousey and Deji running his mouth!
Alex really said “what’s knockout power?” And “I fight with combos” like what????😭 Deji got this in the bag
This literally feels so weird 😂they seem like they r happy and nice to eachither it’s so odd
why are they being so nice to each other
Deji gotta learn how to trash talk better
The first few seconds Alex wasabi lost eye contact while deji locked his eyes on him, Alex doesn’t look confident in my opinion, could change in fight night but who knows
Why Alex lip biting?
Alex wassabi got knocked out by fousey, if Deji doesn't win then Fousey technically could beat Deji
I don't know if Alex is being himself or not because I don't watch his videos but he's giving more YouTuber energy than an actual boxer. Maybe he's just preserving his energy but who knows...I still have faith Deji.
Guys i think someone is gonna win
This was a great "face off" without there being too many fake elements to it, very genuine and honest.
40 ponds is still not good at all
Alex seems so uncomfortable n has no confidence
Massive respect to how much deji has lost weight wise
Alex man is very cringey and when deji asks him stuff alex dosnt have he tiptoes around the answer for e.g do you have knockout power alex explains he hasnt knocked anyone out but dosnt say he doesn’t have knock out power he avoids the answer he could of said he dosnt need it for example
Big respect for Alex, he apprdciays the effort that's big and humble fair play to them both
It's nice to see them take this seriously without the stupid trash talk.
good luck to both
Wtf they are having living room conversations 😂😂 respect for both
Can they just make out already please
Alex was just playing 21 questions
why does this feel like therapy lol
Can’t wait 🔥🔥
Deji you’re good, the stamina wasn’t there. If you already worked hard to loose the weight etc. even if you loose this one no need to stop. Your  punches are crazy we have all seen it. You just gotta work harder and you did, but don’t stop now. Quitters never win and winners never quit my friend.
Respect to Alex I like him more after this but deji knocking his ass out
Id Love to see Wassabi win, not cause I like the dude, but because it would be funny to see Deji lose to him, he acts like he almost beat jake but in reality he was sloppy asf his stance, the way he throws his punches. I've seen middle schoolers throw more accurate punches
Every deji fight is on has a 5 in it August 25th June 5th and March 5th
DEJI GANG
I think I can speak for everyone here if deji looses this he needs to stop boxing and do something else..   Or stop pretending to train and actually put in the work it takes to become good..
This reminded me of goku ultra instinct when he said “he fighting for his self”
I feel like deji still thinks wasabi is a weakling  He’s underestimating him  Hopefully this man doesn’t get whooped by Alex
Imagine if Deji impulsively calls out Jake to fight after if Deji wins
The respect I have for Alex after this is mad, I actually see them being friends after this. But team deji all the way !
Deji going to lose, he’s been practicing for 5 weeks, it’s the sad truth
Both chatting shit before this now they chillin 😂
is it just me or Alex really  looked scared at the end ?
see i love deji i really want him to win but you never know you know what alex wassabi is packing so there might be a chance but i think will knock him out hes got power he just needed training and good form and physique and judging  by videos of him training i can see him putting the work so go on deji show the world what you been packing and spit on those haters for telling you aint gonna win GO DEJI :)
"Wanna fight now ?" ahahaha
Deji gonna loose, im not rooting for deji until he proves himself
if deli loses win , he's dun out
Deji round 5 knockout
I love deji but now his too over confident 🙃🙃
Bruh this is the deadest face to face oml 🥱😵
Everyone rooting for Deji to redeem himself, but Alex doesn’t deserve to lose neither, good luck to both 👍
Don’t stress deji you got this man have fun out there
Deji mate. Don't trash talk Alex, not that im a fan of Alex and not a like a fan boi a of Alex but I have mad respect to Alex to respect the freaking hardwork that Deji puts in for his redemption.
come on deji we love you deji
Damn these dudes make me feel fattt, I sit naturally between 195-205lbs and I’m only 5’9” don’t get me wrong I hold some good muscle mass, but damn, I’m too heavy 😂😂
Jake is not a 8 or 9
haha they looks like best buddies who had only one fight 😂😂
This has to be the nicest face 2 face ever…im not surprise if this kiss each other during the fight
W
Most civilest fact to face I’ve ever seen 😅
If I got a £1 for everyone comment that says “respect” I’d be rich asf.
Deji lowkey looks STONE COLD in this interview.
Respect to both of them but alex looked kind of nervous a lot of movement with his head, hands talked more
Come on Deji you got this
Alexs body language lol this is to easy for Deji
theres no way this nigga is 31
Deji bring home the dub 💯💯
How many google pixel 6 ads…wtf
This is like a date with someone who you’re not interested in
Deji's trying to sell the fight and you know damn well Alex doesn't care. He's just here for a good time.
This was awkward to watch haha
He so nervous look at the way he keep moving looking around taking his jacket of 😂😂
When deji I wouldn’t know I don’t watch yr videos 😂😂😂💀
The deji redemption arc.
Red or Blue Pill?
Their having a casual conversation and are talking nice things about each other 😂😂 (at least Alex is)
There’s mutual respect and we love to see it, we don’t see that in Face offs. I see a lot of confidence from Deji and Alex got a little flustered here for sure.  Hopefully they can back up their talk.
déjà will loose
Respect!
31? Alex Wasabi looks like he's 17.
first minutes seemed like a reunion of exes.
Why does Wassabi sound and stare so gay
This fight I think regardless who wins I a preety sure there will be a good job hug or something but I think deji will win
he's soo scared i can see it
Deji “I’m gonna eat u alive” Alex “okay”
Deji a boxer 🤣🤣
Nobody talkin about deji loosing 40 pounds?? If thats true then god damn 💀
Alex doesn't look 31 ngl Good luck to both fighters Hope Deji wins tho love Alex's vibe too💯🔥
Dejis got the death stare
Deji has not lifted his eyes off Alex, holy shit he's in go mode.
the nicest face 2 face after so long
honestly i like this way more very respectfull
Honestly can’t even get mad at Alex very humble guy
🤡
I love how nice they are to each other. It will help them both!
Deji didn’t even move once.
Feels like they were flirting. I feel like I shouldn’t have watched what I have just watched 😂
Deji K.O first round babyyy
Who's up for deji and Alex be Russia?
DEJI LETSGO
Who’s actually watching all of this?😂😂 fr fr
Wassabi looks like a Mafia 3 character with all that smiling he only needs a cigar tho and itll be perfect 😂
Deji is SERIOUS!!
ngl alex looks like he is so unconfident, you can see it in his face, he knows dejis going for him and deji will win
Have to say, I got everything on Deji! <3
nice
what the fuck going on
Deji you are going to win
Well I'm excited for this.
I may be a part of the USA but, rooting for you Deji BEAT THE HELL OUT OF HIM!
I like the confidence deji showing fr fr but just remember the Cocky mf falls the hardest💯💯
Deji looks tired and I’m HAPPY.
I don’t like how deji is talking here
Hi
Holy shit Alex is 31 years old he doesn’t even look 20 damn lmao
If Deji doesn’t knock him out, it’s a loss
Cmon Deji you got this
is alex trying to take deji on a date or what
As 21 Savage said “They disrespect eachother respectfully
😂👍
Welp If he loses this he ain't fighting no more your career is on the line
they might as well get kfc and watch a film after this😂😂😂😂
This is the corniest *Face2Face* I've ever seen
This was lowkey was more calm than I thought it was gonna be, glad both respected eachother, but Deji will knock Alex out cold.
Very chill convo actually.
two clowns, one ring, who will win?
Alex is so passive aggressive it feels like Deji is fighting a woman
Did anyone actually watch all this?
Alex not built for trash talk he’s trying not to be nice but he can’t help but be nice 😂
Please deli knock this guy out
Deji plz. Plz.
rooting for you deji
March 5th is the new August 25th😂
If this was pornhub,..Wasabi's upperlip would literally smell like dej butt union....  damn the ass kissing from this dude makes me believe he is doing absolutely everything to be the underdog and losing is expected
*LESSGO DEJIIIIII*   *CMON TEAM U.K* (I'm Aussie btw😂 but I stick to team UK in this case cause I'm a huge fan of Kenny and Deji💪)
Deji was just being open but Alex was playing mind games .
Idk if it nerves or what but Alex seems like he's chatting shit xD *Alex:* "I been fighting professionals in sparring..." *Also Alex:* "Well they aren't professionals, more like amateurs from the Olympics that haven't had pro debut" lmao xD
Alex looks cold here not gonna lie I'm worried for dej now he looks calm and ready
I’m rooting for Deji
Why isn't this fight on Sportsbet? Not a YouTube Boxing event if I can't lose money
Is it just me that thinks that guy in the middle is biased as hell. Asking Deji questions about his last losses and lack of self belief, but asking Alex about how confident he is. Rewatch it and you'll see what I mean, that's a bit outrageous
Deji looks like he wants to steal some bananas
Lmao they were so nice to each other 😂. Unexpected as hell.
77kg that’s huge cmon
The type of conversation that is happening here feels like a hook-up conversation.
boring ass fight build up smh
Deji vs Wasabi who has advantage:  Stamina -Probably Alex Power - Deji Reach - Alex Technique- Deji Height- Alex If you ask me who wins, I’d say it comes down to who has the greater willpower to remain standing
march 5th march 5th just wait for march 5th march 5th
why does alex look scaredd????lol
I obviously really want Deji to win but I wouldn’t be mad if Alex wins. He’s always seemed like a cool respectable dude
Deji pretending he has KO power LMAO
Alex voice is so damn annoying. Mf sounds like he never hit puberty
The don’t hate each other they are like best friends this is mad different yo
Demi gonna shock the wolrd
I hope Deji wins
Bruh this isn’t a face 2 face it’s legit to friends catching up it seems like
Deji looks like Adewale from the fourth Assassin's Creed game.
you're gonna lose deji
Lord, sorry deji brotha but that's what the press conference and weigh ins are for... respect the hustle/content, just makes me feel alil sus bout the fight... Fixed?
It’s all for the money 😂 so scripted they both know it’s fake
alright deji's physically well, now we have to work on the mental aspect because he was being a dick 2 minutes in
They flirting?
My guy?? This is a conversation, not a face 2 face 😂😂🤣🤣
how tall are both the fighters??
Dej is my dog and I'll always root for him, and Alex looks like he's in a good place, hope for a good fight and Dej W!!  Respect to both these guys.
Deji gets know out round 2
Am I the only one who cringed at how nice they were being to eachother 😭😭😭
This might be the most polite face to face ever. Deji, this is your redemption arc. Go out and beat him!
Lets go deji
Yoooo Deji seems so mature
why does it feel like a therapy session...lmfao
Deji better not lose 🔥
Don't fucking let us down deji
Aw what a nice guy
just me or is alex whispering half the time ?
deji u got this pls dont lose
letsss goooo
deji looks ready to fuck shit up.
Alex really threw deji off at the beginning of this. He controlled the interview
Alex is 31 but looks younger.
You guys are saying this is the most peaceful but it’s not. The look deji gave was shaking wasabi to his core, look how he was backed into a corner at 20:33. Deji’s mindset is way stronger and his demeanor is full of confidence. The way wasabi is moving around too much shows all of the doubt and how uncomfortable he is. Wasabi tried his best to break his confindence but Deji stood his ground.
Deji’s underestimating Alex like he did in his last two fights, I have a feeling this will be a lot harder fight than he against Jake & Vinnie
this is a face to face not a fucking date...
All in on Deji, no way he loses this one
19:34 HAHAHHAHAHAHAH deji "i'm learning to box"
You can tell they don't hate each other but deji is definitely putting his head in the space of this is my opponent and I will destroy him and I think Alex is the same way but more so excited since it's his first main fight to show his skills and how he has been working. Overall I can see after the fight that they could be good friends
Alex Wasabi looks like a retired back-up dancer for the Backstreet Boys.
I swear Face offs always look so funny 💀
I love deji man
Yeah I don’t hate Alex at all tbh just want Deji to show the world what he’s made of
I see a lack of confidence in Alex as well
Deji blud , if you lose to this neek this will make you 2X the neek you already are.
Let’s get this fucking Dub Deji🔥🔥🔥🔥
Y does the start seem like a casual convo
this was a quite mature conversation compared to younger versions of these 2
Deji barely smiling is scary 👀
Ayo Deji looking like a beast this time.  Good luck to both fighters 🥊 But I’m on Deji’s side 💯
Yo make us proud 😼😼😼
I feel like deji saying alex underestimates him was almost on script and he genuinely wasn't expecting alex to compliment him by saying he thinks deji has improved, but Deji didn't know what else to say so said it anyway xD.
alex didn’t understand the task
I don’t even think that Deji has to win he just has to prove he took it seriously
Idc what you say deji is going to kill this young man
Deji looks like a recovering alcoholic single dad about to prove it to his son that he can do anything.
Bring home the L
Alex is a clown ngl
Alex surprised the fuck outta me in this - I’m backing Deji but Alex handled this rlly well and was mature and respectful - hard to hate the guy after this
Just imagine Alex winning.  Man I hope he wins. What then
Alex is the biggest shit talker 😂😂😂
Alex look scared when deji asked to fight him loool
This will be an extremely fun close fight. Deji got that British Black warrior blood in him and Wassabi got that Mexicano Brown savage blood in him. I’m expecting an all out war
I rate alex for being so straight up and respectable, would of hoped for deji to be slightly more respectable rather then mocking it 😂 but overall made for an entertaining face2facw
Deji trying to act tough is cringe worthy
Just don’t tweet, *I’m gonna shock the world*
if you take the boxing out of this it just sounds so erotic wtf
Alex lowkey acts like deji didn't drop 40 pounds so all that muscle being at 210 will be noticed at deji being 170 Alex doesn't realize deji basically cut a bunch of weight and bulked up the strength deji will have will definitely be noticed over wassabis strength
Ohh I hate hes voice
As an American… Go Deji 😂
They look so friendly we want trash talk  Deji need to work on his trash talk
Alex seems quite nervous to me though 🤣 not gonna lie
This is the nicest face off lol
Alex is 31 WHAT THE -
Alex Wasabi looks like a gay scooter kid from Beverly Hills.
i want to seeeeeeee the fight now lets goooo
Deji I have £300 on you!!
How is Deji talking about relevancy when his channel fell off and he barely gets views.. LOL.
Alex is 31... what...
Deji tried to trash talk maybe his inner dignity didn’t let him. Respect ✊
This looked like a catch up between 2 friends
Alex is too nice lmao hahaha
Bruh alex is 31 years old. 😮😮😮😮
They actually have mad respect for each other
Why does Alex keep saying he has been training more and that there are no excuses for him to lose. I like his confidence but if he loses it wont look good😂🤦‍♂️
Im backing deji, but respect to Alex for being respectful 👑💪🏿
WTF!!!! Lol who else thinks this is scripted    I'm literally crying 😂😂😂😂
Cool
Kinda want both guys to win after seeing this lol.
LOL Alex is dominating this convo.. The one who asks the questions is the one in charge
deji is the only one who has knockout power tho
I'm in school legit watching this
I've watched the first 30 seconds of them sitting down and all i can say is Deji is here to absolutely KILL
Never really cared about Alex wasabi but I respect him after this
The nerves will get to Alex on fight night
Alex sounds hella on his nerves haha
Hopefully Deji gets KO'd again and we don't have to see him in a ring again. Inshallah
Lots of people here that really didn't pick up on things in this face to face. I found Deji over confident and too cocky which is fine. But he has a lot to lose and carrying so much on his shoulders considering his losses so far.  This type of Deji we've seen before. I'm not falling for it. After that abysmal Vinny fight I don't think there's reason to be so confident. A humlbe driven and motivatd Deji I'd like to see in this face to face. Alex came across as excited and with a lot of self belief and hoestly he should be after knowing his opponents past fights. He shouldn't over estimate this situation but id be pretty confident too. Alex didnt throw insults and go for low blows yet deji was on the offensive asking if he wanted to fight and not really showing any repsect for Alex (not htat he has to or should). I dont know if Deji asking about Alex's trainers fight records has any relevance in this sitaution but hey ho.   I'm not sure about the comment section saying this was wholesome. It seemed Alex had some level of respect for Deji but not the ther way around.   Either way I look forward to the fight, good luck to both!
so like when are they going to face two face I can't wait till they do
Is this really a face 2 face? 😶
Deji tryna act so hard lmaoo boi stfu
I feel that once the fight is over they will become semi-friends
Dej is gonna floor him
These guys are interviewing each other. I guess no real hate just competition 😂😂
I don’t know what it is exactly but I find Alex wasabi so unlikeable
This was brilliant.. hope deji puts on a performance he has to or he's finished
Let's hope it's not a draw
The difference between the Deji in the Jake Paul Face 2 Face compared to this is unreal. My man looks locked in and focused
The nicest face 2 face ever
I'll tell you one thing: I could trash talk better than both of them
Alex is a cool guy, cant lie
Alex is very humble but I'm rooting for deji
They both look scared as hell
2 months later - "This is it. My 4th & final chance. Deji vs Slim" 💀
these face 2 face really is something
lol literally thought these two are going to go on a verbal war against each other, and 3 mins in they start talking like homies😲😂
Deji finna lose
I like chicken wings
They just having a nice talk tbf
Mad respect for Alex
The jake Paul and Logan fights were good in conference
Feel like deji tried to be confrontational and then realised mf just came w compliments
All this for deji to lose again😂😂🤷🏻‍♂️
This was actually a really good face-off.
I love how this is just a chill talk than a face to face trash talk
We believe in you Deji. Let's get it💪🏿🔥🔥
I don't want peace. I want problems, always.
Give Alex a Grammy for playing deji with mind games
I can tell Deji is ready in his demeanor. Respect to Alex for appreciating Dejis work and noticing that but he doesn’t look serious. Deji looks determined
The shit that deji would do for his Chanel he can't really compare to what alex has done in his, plus with all due respect deji's Chanel has been dead if it wasn't for boxing it would have been fully over but im glad he made it back and is about to put on a show for all if us
Alex is too damn nice lol
Respect 👍🏽
this a sdmn tinder
Deji ate Alex alive, the kid mouth got dry, his body position at the end he crumbled like turtle, you could tell a real confidence & a fake one. No hate Alex you put the work but Deji put his life & that’s a winner mentality
Deji don’t disappoint me
The return of ringside
Are they flirting 😭
Mf tryna sound cold
Soon as Deji said he knocked people out, Alex changed entirely, body language voice, lil bit of nerves came in
After this fight I feel like these two will be mates idk after this rivalry I can see respect
Deji acting too much like a big man, I hope Wassabi ends him just because he is so arrogant and trying to act a role too hard.
3 mins in and im in the gay section of pornhub
Alex made this very awkward.
Respectful pre fight conversation, my moneys on Deji and I hope he wins , next level confidence
Every time Alex speaks I hear Michael Jackson
Deji you better win brake his teeth 😤
Alex can't be mean he's just a nice guy
Leji
Hopefully a story of redemption or all is lost
🧢
Alex playing 21 questions with bae in this video
They're using the chairs wrong
Scariest interview since Jake Paul vs Tyron Woodley 2 face to face & Tyson Fury & Deontay Wilder’s good morning interviews
Damn.. Deji has a lot to lose in this fight. I hope he will be able to perform come Saturday
Here to support deji
fucking hate the fact that you can hear them swallow
This two might as well lips at this point
HahahH proper thinks he’s Johnny nelson
25:30 deji - "he's basically fooled himself" 11:17 also deji - "one thing my coach taught me is self believe"   What's going on mate xD How's man going to contradict himself that hard?
Ngl deji ur channels was also low on views before this fight even before vin
Dejo being serious is strange
AYE YO WTF I EXPECTED A FIGHT HERE 🤣🤣 respect to both fr
I am very excited and it looks like deji is ready asf and looks ripped so I'm sayin deji wins
Alex only respects tf out of dejis dedication now becuase he knows deep down deji is coming out different and when face to face he doesn't tall all that trash he was behind the camera
Their faces during the video Alex:😃😁🤪🥺😂😅 Deji:😐
Tbh I'm team deji and I used to not like Alex wassabi, but after this interview, ì actually starting to like Alex, I'm still team deji
Are these 2 dating or somat they talking like they love each other
Not gonna lie I think Alex might win this
I don't feel the heat in this face off ❄️🍦🍧🍨🏔️⛸️
17:35 . Deji says Alex is overestimating how much work he (Alex) has done. What give Deji the right to say that considering his last two fights?
Damnnn I dunno who to support, I grew up watching Alex but I love deji 🤣 why do two of my favourite YouTubers have to fight,. honestly tho Alex is so nice even whilst doing face faces
Just stating the obvious that USA backs Deji, not Alex.
Deji W
19:38 Savage Part Ever 🤣
This was boring, ngl. At least try and sell it lads.
“Marsh fif”
Good luck to both of you. May the best man win
Alex literly praising deji😂
😭 are they tryna get to know eachother or something
Is it compulsary to sit on your chair backwards?
Boring face 2 face they respect each other😐
This will be a good fight I think Alex will win
Deji coming of as very arrogant, no wonder people dislikes him
I support Alex , but he doesn’t seem confident enough , like he looks nervous obviously because it’s his first fight , but I see Deji winning this one
Rooting for deji, but good luck to both fighters :)
Deji has changed a lot, just seems to have a more focused mindset and he’s seems ready. Fair play to him 👏
...I'm learning to box   -Deji
we'll see march fif
Alex sounds so stressed
Gay.
Deji I swear to god
Imagine peeps behind, they decided to make it a draw, to raise up more profits in the next rematch probs..
Wtf is this 😂  Alex is so nice 😂😂 I’m creasing
Deji is tryna play the intimidation game but Alex is playing the humble game and it’s not working
USA vs UK🇺🇲🇬🇧🤼‍♂️🥊🥊🥊🥊
My respect goes to both 👍💯
Deji dominate this mofo
DEJIS GONNA BEAT TF OUT OF HIM! He is not gonna shock the world this time fosho
All i see is darth maul vs random jedi
march fif
alternative title: two guys trying not to be memed....
If Deji wins we will defo see Jake paul asking for a rematch
This was more of a convo than a press💀
Alex lost a fight against foosey and foosey can't box atall
Alex has always been nice 😂
Tbh, Alex probably doesn’t have much faith or belief in this “work” Deji has put in due to past events. Alex is relaxed I think that fidgety behaviour is just him by nature. I want Deji to win, but Alex just tickles in a way that he has this
W
This shit a joke lol
i nearly fall asleep watching this video
If Deji doesn’t get tired and is composed, I got him winning easy, he is naturally talented in boxing and Alex has a glass jaw
"Orgus tweny fif"
Ouuuuuuuu “are you not learning combinations”? “Im learning boxing”
Alex wasabi just got into boxing and has a lot of respect for the sport✊. It’s as if he’s been doing this for years.   Good luck to both fighters but I am going with deji by decision.
Cringe time !
I don’t think he understands Dejis potential here, if he doesn’t looked ripped isn’t cus he isn’t buff it’s cus instead of just cutting all the fat he turned all that 40 pounds into muscle and cut a lot of fat, I genuinely have hope for deji just seein how he looks, I hope he drops alex
Deji got this boys trust
This has to be the most boring Face-to-face
Alex is actually quite nice
deji will get smacked up
NGL deji was a douchebag at the end.   The other guy was respectful always and deji still being a child.
I think deji is underestimating Alex as much as I want deji to win
Calmest face to face im rooting for Deji but big respect to Alex for respecting deji
7:35 I don’t watch your videos😂😂
Won’t be surprised if they become best friends after the fight
Deji will do a deji nothing new .
4:35 big pause wtf deji XD
This is so dumb. Alex is like 50 pounds lighter and is gonna look like Bryce hall in the ring. Alex is going to get tossed around for 30k$
nicest face to face i have ever seen
deji be so awkward lmao
respect to alex tho
Low-key still think Alex is gonna take the W
Tbh I don’t think alex underestimated deji. Deji didn’t do what he was supposed to multiple times so it’s natural to think he would do it again. I like both of them as youtubers and humans but I’ve watched alex longer so I’m rooting for him.
is this a podcast orrrr??
Alex: “ I think I’m going to fight the real Deji not the bad weak Deji” Deji: “He’s underestimating me”
deji was trying not to laugh YLYL video lol
This was more of a podcast than a face to face xD
This is like some asmr shit 🤣
Let's win deji this is your chance to rise
Good luck Deji but you are still very cringe
deji: *intesne eye contact* let's not forget deji that you KEPT eye contact with Jake the whole time and still lost.
Alex is a good dude. Fr  a lot of respect i love him. I just want to see the results
All these fake boxers make me laugh
okay i actually really like the respect between them
One of these Ls is going to get a w
deji will loose tbh its less probable for deji to win alex was training for 6 months apparantly but deji 6 weeks not emough man
Both showing respect and no hostile backn back. Props to them
What pros are you fighting💀
Ngl I think Deji has actually got this one in the bag
This is some psychological warfare from Alex here, very complimentary
Alex Wassabi is so scared lol
That nigga sounds soft asf
Anyone know how many rounds and minutes per round it is?
man wassabi is smart .. he is talking humble so even if he loses he doesnt become a meme.. but this fking deji talking like he is some pro boxer .. man is 0-2 and got humbled badly and now talking like he got the upperhand ..
btec gloves are off
Guys . . . . . Alex is going to win
I think the problem with both of them is that Deji is too willing to prove himself, especially when he said “you wanna fight right now?” And Alex Wassabi is just a little pussy. So match results are gonna be Alex and Deji put up a good fight and then a 4th round knockout by Deji
7:32 Deji put em in the bin 🤣
If Deji loses this he needs to delete his channel
kiss ffs
get a room
Respect to Alex for wanting to get in the ring but when you fight this version of deji you’re gonna really realise how hard he has worked and he’s gonna kick your ass
friendly chat right here damn
ya donkies again
alex is actually pretty nice, he's just happy to be there
really hyped for this, alex is lowkey chill
I'm from the future degi wins
Y is this soo wholesome in the beginning 😂
Wait...Alex Wassabi is 31!???? THE FUCK!?😂😂
Alex is to nice to punch in the face lol. Even if deji wins he loses, how do you hit that happy kid. Lmao
They are talking like there on some chill podcast together wtf
Idk Wasabi's voice is so feminine 😭
Idk who will win I hope deji but idk
Alex was so nervous and he's showing it. He can't look at Deji for long, and he takes deep breathes while he's talking. Example at 8:23, I do this too when I'm nervous.
Deji tryna light smoke being too over confident. After everything I think he will win because a lose will be seen as a betrayal to his supporters. But still
Lets go Deji  You Got This!
This face2face is entertaining..hilarious too considering they're like "You lost 40 pounds? That's crazy man..that's good" "Thank you man" XD
Wassabi hasn’t sparred properly, them man take it easy on him because he’s not about it
He just can’t use all his cardio in the first 2 rounds and he should be fine
Alex is really well spoken and humble, ive never watched him i used to just think he was some cringey loud mouth
Deji is so childish. He needs to grow up.
When asked "What you see in alex" I wanted him to say some sus shit, opportunity missed
Alex is just to nice man I don’t want to see that face get destroyed
This is so chill and civilised 😂
TIME FOR WAR
Deji, if he wins Should call out Jake Paul It would be a great match
These are the worst people to have a face to face video of lmao
We all know who ever talks the most loses and the one is silent / most shot talker type wins
Lmaoo deji is trying to hard lol
Calling it now, Alex is fucked
This isn't really shit talking or mind games. Kinda seems like a convo between the two
this is gonna be memed so hard tho
i trust deji ddeji deij deji deji dejidejiiiiiiiiiiiii
TANK!
Tbh Alex looks nervous
Alex will win deji never learnt from past still cocky
20:43 Deji saying “do you wanna fight now” is just a stupid thing to say obviously they aint fighting now like😂chattin shit is one thing but entertaining it is another
This alex dude is a squeaker😭
That is the youngest looking  31 year old i've ever seen
YOU CAN DO IT DEJI, WE'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN YOU.
Alex talking like he on a facetime call with a baddie 😂
Deji seems so cold these days and I love it. He seems motivated and best of all, he’s humbled himself. Let’s go Deji!!!!
Alex was  a big ahh part of my childhood but we all know deji got this in the bag
All of a sudden, Alex just became a good guy wtf
Daaaamn 77kg ?????? Thats hella hardwork respect Deji hope u win ✊
Aii.
Come on dej go get the w for us
This is the oddest head to head ever
Respect for each other for a reason. Guess nobody seen the old footage of them together.
Alex being 31 really blows my mind. I'm 28 myself and I though he was a kid who is max 22-23. Good luck to both of them. I'm Team DEJI let's go.
this is more of a date than a face 2 face lmao!
Deji aka skeeny neeck got this
Damn Deji is 77kg, he really worked hard this time :D
TEAM DEJI!!!!!
This is not what i Expected. SMH
They are just having normal conversations lol
This fight parallels the Jake vs Tommy fight
Alex seems to be sucking up
This is just a friendly conversation hahahahhahaha
Deji gonna get that W.  I can feel it coming...
When Alex kept clicking his neck like some WWE wrestler deji should've slapped him into next week
This is weird
1:44 bruh that nervous gulp like in the cartoons lmfao
alex ko by kindness lol
Alex don’t lose easily I’m not a fan but I want a show Alex :) so I’ll say this it doesn’t matter who wins just don’t lose pathetically
You can clearly see Deji's change in attitude, The first face2face with Jake he was feeling himself being smiley and carefree. However this time Deji looks lazerfocused and ready to scrap there.
we need a deji vs Vinnie hacker rematch after this like... ong
Alex did well in this
If Deji wins I think I might shed a tear or joy
wait this aint bad blood no more
the sexual tension damn
Why don't they understand how chairs work 🥴
That's harmfully wholesome for a Face 2 Face
This is over before it even started Alex by TKO
Alex is too excited
It's nice the mutual respect they have for each other
Deji is locked in and not looking away Alex looked shook 😂
Lol they are talking like friends it’s kinda nice
too cringe... :/
"I learned to box😐" - Deji
alex has change a lot
Ayye good shit guys. Let's Go Deji!!
There gunna be cuddling when they go in the ring
Deji got this. He never let his eyes off him
Deji is gonna  get knocked out in devastating fashion this could be fatal
I'M ROOTING FOR YOU DEJI !!! MAKE US PROUDDDD
First time Deji hasnt been over confident in a face2face. Bunch of random trashtalk ofc but he seems alot more relaxed and humbled. The things a good coach does
Why does the guy in the middle speak like Boris?
friendliest face off ngl
Is it me or deji not the brightest tool in the shed??????
Alex was rattled by the combo talk from deji
Much respect to the both of them , I feel like these guys have motivated me to change my life around , anything is possible If you put in the work Goodluck Deji hope you win and Goodluck Alex for being humble.
Deji I fucks with you, I really do. I’m happy you toned down the shit talk but please give it everything you got, that’s all I ask
Alex is 31 years old?  Man looks 21.  While I’m here 24 years old looking 50.  Da fuq
Pls win this
This was at the brink of being intimate
Wassabi is 31 ?!
kinda finding it hard to hate wasabi now ngl
This going to be interesting 🎥💨🥊💨 LETs GO🔥
Loud deji is cringy quiet deji is cringy im so confused
Glad to finally see some sort of respect in the YouTube boxing scene. Really looking forward to this.
with alex i see a man thats scared of loosing and the fear of failure
looks like a wish henry cavill
Positive vibes is where they are at
itd have been soo cool if deji said  "im doing this for the money" easter egg type shit
You better kill this man 🔥🔥🔥
Deji: I'm gonna go through you... Chisora: Like a laxative!
I’m sorry but you can’t have a lack of confidence & underestimate someone, the two cannot go together, Deji sounded dumb there. He shouldve said overconfidence
if deji lose again... he should start playing barbie
In reality Alex is just a kind soft dude, I wish he dropped his tough-guy persona completely because it doesn't fit him at all.
Alex talks like he’s genuine but his facial expressions just seem so smug and offputting
North L
comon deji we believe in you !!!
Wtf their just chatting like how u see one of the people u know in a party and just talk to them so you won't look awkward and out of place lmao
Although Deji put in the work, he's underestimating Alex hard. I watch Deji but I got Alex winning.
These are so cringe man.
i think that Alex isn’t confident
Team deji all the way❤️
Respect To Both
I love Deji, but my god he can be cringy 😅
why are they being so nice bruh 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Dej your my favourite youtuber im watching you for over 4 years now every single video ♥ get that W man i belive in you and always did ♥
Damn they rlly spoke in lower case only 🥴
Im mean i like deji but sorry i am on alex side because he was my childhood
Wasabi by KO or decision
This fight had zero to no promo😂😂I didn’t even know the fight was suppose to be on Saturday until this video dropped
Why are they whispering lol
I want deji to win but Alex seams so calm and confident
Deji is saying Alex Doesn’t have heart in boxing when he lost to a kid and Jake Paul really
I’m honestly so confused what is this
Wasabi would win sorry deji but still u could see easily
deji thinks hes something hes not lmfao
alex is wet
They are both too nice 🤦🏾
Deji for the dub! He looks ready 💯💪🏿
“I’m learning to box” Yh he sounds wayyy better than before like he doesn’t sound overly confident my opinion I am very hopeful
Alex is a fucking legend, handled this by being nice and diffused any anger dejo could have had. It’s mental I’m definitely a new fan of Alex
Alex kept looking away that shows something. Deji stared at him the whole time.
Fact of the day:  Deji is not a fighter, he doesn't have it in him.
The fact these 2 know nothing about fighting makes this hilarious🤣
Alex genuinely seems like hes such a nice guy, the poor guy gets so much hate from everyone
Deji and alex is gonna be friends after the fight and make the next version of prime drink
I like both of them
This is the most calm face 2 face. I swear most of the time it’s just really toxic… 👌🏾👌🏾
Alex’s voice 😂😂
These could actually be friends normally without boxing love the respect they gave for each other
Deji if you lose this please stop doing boxing 😒
At times Alex sounds more like Deji’s fan than his opponent 😂😂
I feel like you can tell that they respect and lowkey like each other 😂 from the first few minutes but I’m here for the fight anyways I’m for deji but Alex seems cool so I’m just here for the entertainment 🤙🏼 let’s get it bois.
I’m sorry I love Deji but we need more shit talk
Alex is so nice I love it
whos deji
how many rounds is it
This is serious Deji Need to ACTUALLY win this fight because Alex Got nothing to lose tbh but if Deji lose its over then. Go take the W Dej We here for you
The most Unclimactic face off I’ve ever seen lol 😂  but I’m gonna allow it because they both have worked so hard and both seem like they’re good people ya know!!  I really want both of them to win lol . Guess we’ll all find out lol 😂    Wishing them both so much luck 🍀  and love ❤️ and MAY THE BEST MAN WIN 🥇!!! Have fun out there!!
Deji is gonna smash this easy.
This is so wholesome. I love how both of these guys respect each other.
Deji come on who da fook is this guy your fighting
Alex talks a lot of smack for someone that got dropped by fucking fouseytube
Deji is going to lose
Why is this face off quite cute
Come on Deji you’ve got this✊
Alex looks nervous stretching all the time😂
this is strangely wholesome, not complaining
Bruh if deji looses shit is going to be heartbreaking
he scaredddd!!
DEJI is fully in....
Let’s go deji
How on gods earth is Alex wassabi 31
210 pounds to 170 jeeeesh!
This face 2 face like a date 🤣
bruhh alex fuckn breaking his bones
Deji has ice in his veins. My man is looking laser focused. We  want that W!!!!
so hyped
so wholesome
I’m rooting for you Deji please don’t lose this ❤️
Lol this Alex guy doesn’t have a scooby
His 31 😱😱😱😱 man he looks young lol
bruh these guys are friends no cap
a table, a kindle, and it's the most beautiful date ever XD but LBR I loved how they atualyy respect eachother and it's gonna be great fight can't wait 🔥
Deji gon lose again....
Congrats on losing so much weight, make the UK proud
Deji looks ded hearing Alex talk so much
Don’t have much confidence for Alex after this, guy seems too nice for the fight game
This was so dead
Why does deji look like he hasnt been sleeping😂
Both people made my childhood so I can’t pick a team..
I'm still team deji, but not gonna lie Alex seems like a sound guy!
I think Deji will win but it’s not gonna be a pretty win I think Alex will rock deji with a shot
if he somehow loses i hope he dont get hate because he lost 40 pounds which shows how much  and hard he trained
this was surprising wholesome lol
So what are people's predictions for this fight? I feel like Deji will win, but only by points. There will be no knock downs. But their cardio will be good enough to go the distance
If Deji can win, then his victory will inspire anyone who is striving for a redemption arc to work hard
Stay composed Deji, you got this!
Weird Face to Face
Hope Deji wins
I’m glad to see them both carrying themselves like this. 🤟
Come on dej u got this brudda
Bruh I thought the mediator didn't have legs for a whole minute😅
Alex is so nice lmao
Andy kinda looks like Sebastian Stan a little bit. Anyone else agree?
deji is a menace
this unhyped me damn
Clearly even Alex is ready to see Deji redeem himself….
Alex’s talk is very calm and I respect that however I want Deji to win. Deji came in with too much confidence I feel.
It's kinda cringe and childish so far. Idk what to think. I'm entertained tho
who else wants to slap the back of Alex's head when he smiles?
Hope its a hard fight and deji winning
damn fr deji is clapped
🔥DEJI WILL FINALY GET THE☑️WIN!!!!!
93kg to 77 kg??!!! That's mad. Deji about to kill Wassabi
If deji loose again he should just don't ever step in a boxing ever again deji fans been let down alot time.
The thing is Alex is being himself, happy, respectful and confident, not making up a character
alex got my respect from interview
Alex after everything: Let's go
Respect
Alex is only learning combos?
No support for alex loool alex am here for you.
3 strikes and he's out so he has to hit home
Alex switched shirts 😂
I respect that Deji respects that Alex respects him
Kings👑
This fight is gonna be wholesome
imagine if they both got up and just had a fight
Deji for the win 🔥
I expected smoke watching this then the first minute they was d*** riding each other so yeah
If Dej shows up with a six pack and a good body build on the weigh in it's done for Alex , cuz all deji lacked was hard work so i hope he actually worked hard this time.
Alex doesnt seem cringey now
Did deji train to get in shape, aka lose weight, or did he train to beat Alex in the ring? Also sounds like Alex was trained to last in the ring.
Alex looks scared tbh, I think he will crumble on the stage
Playing it safe with what they are saying, they have seen other face to faces and how they all get turned into memes 😂
rooting for alex
Deji tying to talk shit when Alex is being nice but I'm rooting for deji 🔥🔥🔥
alright this is hype!!! UK let's gooooo
THERE BEING TOO NICE TO EACH OTHER
ALEX LESSGGOO
going to be a great fight; but so annoying of deji to treat alex as if he isn’t shit… but then say he isn’t underestimating him.. alex was nothing but excited for deji to be the best he can be.
This has to be one of the best face 2 face. They respected each other, Except alex has too much confidence 😂
This dude alex litteraly complimenting deji and deji has to be the bitch in the situation by eating shit
deji is gonna crush this guy
Well i am still at 3:25 but i think they will kiss each other at 5:00
LETSSS GOOO DEJIIII
Let’s gooo, respect to both
tf wrong w the middle guy asking alex about it being his first fight again and again. seems a lil biased imo
why does alex look like tbnrfrags the old minecraft guy
Ima stop U lot from time wasting. Fair play to Alex he ain’t talking like he can actually box but deji is and he can’t throw punches to save his life. People say it’s dudes stamina but his punches looked as awful as the new comers at the boxing gym. Watch Ali vs Frazier 2 or ray Leonard vs hearns 1.
Where's the heat I don't like this respect shit😜
Feels like Alex has a lot of nervous energy, like he hasn’t prepped much for the interview
i hope alex wins 🤣🤣🤣
No fucking way he's 31 😂😂😂😂
Alex is very nice, Deji just like “ok what do I do when he’s this nice, it’s a trick right, no it can’t be”
Why was this so wholesome lol, I was expecting shots fired the whole time🤣
is it me or can i feel the tension through the screen.
i cant see Deji winning tbh, but i really hope he wins
Deji asks if he learning combos Deji making us look dumb
Keep underestimating Deji once he goes on the stage, everyone will respect the work he put for the fight 💪🏼💪🏼
I’m going to shock the world
Deji didn’t break eye contact 🔥
This was akward
Deji all the way!!!
Too much nervous movement from wassabi. Deji still motionless. Deji dub.
hes fighting alex wassabi 🤣😭
Just listening to Alex speak about boxing it's clear he doesn't understand it so good luck man it's gonna be a bumpy ride vs the tank the real tank now man he he he
lets gooooooooooooo deji, your going to smash this fight, believe in yourself
Both such nice guys but Alex is the least intimidating guy ever I can’t lie
I am suprised by how this went
Alex was pretty chill not gonna lie
why does Alex talk like hes talking dirty
Anyone gonna make a discord server, we can talk about the fight there and have fun ;))
Ayo this is just a therapy session bruh tf is this lmao nah but respect for both tho but come on I want more shit talk
i think deji is underestimating alex way to much tbh
This is the kindest press conf 😂
Wassabis body language shows a lot of stress and pressure buildup
at this point if alex back down his shit and let deji have his comeback, i won't be surprised
If deji is already talking about quiting if he loses again he defs aint made for this and he's gonna be 0-3 with a mindset like that
I love how they're just having a polite conversation lmao
If deji is already talking about quiting if he loses again he defs aint made for this and he's gonna be 0-3 with a mindset like that
They look more likely to kiss than fight right now 😂
Dej should stay humble for now
Another lost for rust tank.
Deji break his face
Pretty nice guy😂
To me he’s talking and acting just like the Deji that got beat twice hope you can back it up this time if not good luck on YouTube
didnt expect this to go like that
I genuinely want Alex to win.
Wasabi looks like he’s showing up to a press conference, Deji looks like he’s shown up to train. I think Deji has Wasabi in mental strength.
If deji loses this fight it's over😂
So Deji has trained properly for 6 weeks !!! Daaaaamn 🤣
Dude wasabi is surprisingly nice wtf
17:02 Alex says what their records are  Few seconds later Deji asks what are their records
bruh it looked like a candle light dinner tf
alex is so nice what the frick
if connor murphy lost his biceps…
I really expected from Alex to talk like Jake Paul bullsh!t , but he have gain my respect Good luck for both
boring as fck
15:42 Alex stayed silent 😂
Americans are so strange
Alex is too nice hmmm 🤔
Alex's smile is so contagious. Honestly Deji, I want to root for you, but Alex has won me over dude.
may the best man win respect
dejis stare at wassabi feels like his in love
I appreciate that they respect each other. They seem to be taking this seriously and they are not literally shouting at each other the whole time. I’m excited to see this fight go down.
alex body language screams nervousness cracking knuckles stretching constantly moving deji still and confidnet LETSGOO DEJI
Deji never took his eyes on wasabi thats how much he wants it
Alex gotta give it to him sounds like a nice guy dk if he's one of those ppl that are gonna be unexpectedly good
this is funny to watch
Alexxxx and roi guava juice
Deji if you lose you will never be remembered .
I’m behind deji
GWON DEJI LAD
Deji looks like he wants it more than Alex let’s go deji💪💪
Wassabi took this face to face and took control hopefully the fight isn’t the same
I was expecting some sauce to be honest but these fighters actually respect each other
Deji u gotta humble this kid man,all the best,do your best,we are all behind you
U can tell man Alex isnt cmftrble!
Alex congratulating Deji for losing weight was unexpected and also whole heartily whole conversation. Which is great to see! Can’t wait to see the fight. Never thought I would respect Alex but he earned my respect after watching this face to face.
Intro song please?
Gotta love the fact we get to see the most smiling ass YouTubers be face to face and fight.
Alex is legit so nice ngl but im team deji like i want him to win so bad he really needs it
Alex is SCARED ASF
Damn Alex asks a lot of questions
Deji is so calm and collected I feel a rnd 1 ko 🤨
Alex has a really hittable face tbh respect to both of em tho, Deji lookin a lot better this time around and I hope Alex is ready too. He came off a little worried and even threw out compliments/suggested that he would likely lose to Dej..
Alex is doubting himself, its clear
Alex wasabi is just a knock of guava juice
It scares me with how calm Deji is…..we’re rooting for you 🙂
Will this be a professional or amateur bout?
Deji looks like he's got some fire in his belly this time around here's to hoping he shows his progress.
He is gonna shock the world 😂
Hope deji wins.Alex is so excited and it's so cool to see
So awkward here
Guarantee deji gonna gas out again
Deji. U got this. Fuck this guy up at 1st round man. Pleaseeeee
big up to alex here
Good luck Deji
Some passive aggressive face 2 face
deji is going to get knocked the fuck out
This feels like a date
DEJI MAINTAINING THE SAME MENTALITY WHICH WAS SHOWN ON THE DOCUMENTARY. ALEX LOOKS DIFFERENT HERE, IS IT BECAUSE OF DEJI?  WE WILL FIND THAT ON MARCH 5TH .
I don't care what it sounds like but the way dejis attitude has changed for boxing its got me way more excited about the sport because I've watched deji for so long its like watching a freind grow for the best, get this win boiiiiii!!!!!❤❤❤❤
Alex  is a good person
It's actually refreshing to see them both respect each other instead of all that drama Good on them!
Complete waste of time. Embarrassing this is even allowed
As far as their rivalry goes, I wish both of them good luck.
wtf he's too nice LOOOL
Deji is locked in fam and idk if u guys can tell but the movement Alex is making and the occasional times he is swallowing his word shows a lack of confidence
- Deji Tyson  “I’m gonna eat you alive”
19:40 deji says “I’m learning to box” and alex looks so nervous when he says this
How many fucking times does Alex want to roll his neck🤣🤣wet wipe
i can see alex trembling and deji is sitting chill. I hope deji wipes that smile off his face, lets go deji
After seeing this I think we can expect a collab  sometime after the fight
Alex is not confident, he's just doing this for the clout.
COME ON DEJI
This is just a conversation .
After wasab,i this man better claim jakes head next.
Before y'all say it alex is not overconfident he's just excited I have felt that feeling before as I've been in a competition and could not stop smiling when I saw the other team anyways big ups to deji and Wasabi good luck to the both of y'all
I wanna see the weigh in
Alex needs to grow some balls
L vs L
Am I the only one thinking deji tries too hard to be intimidating here when he has a losing record of 0-2. It kinda makes him come off as arrogant rather than confident. Alex is super chill while deji's out here mean muggin. So what if it's alex first fight brodie u literally lost twice.  Just cus u already played the game doesn't mean a newbie couldn't beat you at it.  It would help to be more humble especially if he loses this fight then it would just be so embarrassing.   Love deji but come on man
Deji will shock the world 😂😂
Props to Alex for having to deal with all that Deji's cringe
Tbf, if he's lost like 16kg, since that last fight 🤞 the cardio there we, 🤞he turns up
20:43  i know whos winning on saturday
This gives tyron Woodley vs Jake Paul vibes Alex is under estimating Deji and deji’s gonna come through
This is so peaceful and nice I love this
Deji oozing confidence 💪
Hope Deji wins but respect to Alex wasabi, seems like a really nice respectful guy
why is this somewhat seductive
i aint rooting for Deji, because im tired of that, but ill be watching
Respect to Alex for respecting Deji
Alex's voice is too annoying to watch this and it's pissing me off because I actually want to watch it. Good luck Deji
you just know they have a lot of respect for each other
When two dead channels try to revive them self’s
I hope deji looses
Alex is smart… lol but Deji handled it properly.
Deji at this point shouldn't be this confident he should be humble and let his actions speak
yo both of them are so nice and respectful HAHA
This is the most wholesome face2face I have seen
you can tell alex isn’t ready to fight deji and you can tell he is scared  when deji told alex he wants to fight alex looks at the guy in the middle straight away and you can tell he is hoping he steps in because alex isn’t truely ready to fight the new deji 20:50
Alex I got too respect you G ..not one have u broke that smile damn man deji he just as focused as you are
I honestly think none of these fighters will lose , it’ll be a draw .
Alternative title: 2 Men having a friendly conversation
omg, they nearly kissed like 4 times.
2:58 minutes in and I’m already cringed out lmfao 🤣 😂 🤣
Only thing I see is that Alex is nervous as fuck. Deji isn’t nervous and I love to see him being so confident, hope it’s just not overconfidence. I see him winning this fight purely because Alex has no chin and because it is Alex’s first time. Idk about the difference in boxing skills tho.
Why they tryna copy the gloves are off 😂😂😂
All in for Dej no cap🔥👀
This is the most polite face 2 face ever😂
Deji - 😐 Deji after some convo - 😊
DEJI ANNIHILATE HIM!!!🦁
16:50 you already know who's bluffing here because he litteraly sounded like that meme where the kid stutters his life away
Mind Games Haha
This is embarrassing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was honestly more chill than I thought, regardless, Deji’s gonna spin Alex’s jaw differently on Saturday night
Stay up till two on a school day to watch this and im sad now
We here for you deji 🙌🏾
Alex seems to be giving to much information to deji smart move by deji for getting Alex to open up more
i guess you can say the red and blue lights really chose the right sides to be on based off mood they gave
Legend, mate.
Lol Deji acting like he's the shit is hilarious. I wish him a good nights sleep 😴
These guys are so sweet🤣🤣🤣
Deji looks like he’s been hurt and heartbroken… he might’ve finally developed that killer instinct and focus… I trust deji gonna take the win, you can see the demon inside of him 😳
Idk alex is just cringe
Man this guy actin too good to good look (Alex)
Why does Alex look like a lesbian
I don’t understand why deji just didn’t go to Vidall or that other dude from vidalls gym
It's about drive it's about power
Alex looks nervous af
Deji wins by decapitation
Deji looks like a killer
Horrible video. Awkward as hell. Too relaxed lmao. It’s like they both agreed to make people fall asleep.
Was waiting for them to start having sex at some point Jesus Christ the tone …
Good luck deji
Cringe 😬
what the heck is Bucky Barn doing there?
I know This Video Upload from this Channel      But Alex Is My Vote So good Luck
1:40 did anyone hear Dejis throat swallow when Alex said he's been training even before Deji challenged him😂😆
Deji has that cold stare while Alex was struggling to maintain eye contact
On his first two fights I was like I hope Deji gonna win but this time I know he gonna win🤘😈 Go crazy Deji!!🤘    🔥👑🔥
Alex gonna lose
Hopefully he got to work on that cardio
Much respect to both of these guys. Hope Deji wins this and finally redeems himself.
Bet💀💀
Deji, round 2, calling it 🥊
Alex looks and sounds so insecure, his bodylanguage says it all
This is such a respectful face to face 😭😭😭
Sounds like they flirting with one another
“Honestly, a lack of confidence” WOAH
the cringiest face off i have ever seen
When Deji said ‘you wanna fight now’ you can sense the uncertainty in Alex or the discomfort XD
Deji locking eyes into alex's soul
Are they gonna have head gear ?
Why does it sound like an asmr video?
Alex is too nice
Ryan higa did it first
Deji is seeing wassabi's soul. Wassabi ain't seeing Deji in the eye
TEAM DEJIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠MOUUUUUUUAAAAAAA GO ONNN DEJJJJ
Deji's trash talk is absolutely pathetic.
I came here expecting shit talk Now i have respect for them both
as long as deji shows he’s tried hard and really worked for it, i think he’ll get the respect win or loss but to carry on boxing he needs to slap alex up, be interesting to see if deji is really cut for boxing.
Lol
Deji this is your chance to show the world that you can box
Deji go ham in this fight, act like your life depends on it and just go dog mode, get this w, for all us supporters.
what kind of question is that "did you want to win in your previous fights" no he went in to the fights wanting to get finished and lose 🤡🤡😂😂
Deji lied about not watching Alex's video. Daley his coach said he watched Alex's video. why wouldn't deji, Alex's opponent not watch his video to analyse his weakness etc? it's obvious he shit his pants when he saw Alex's training video. then he changed camps because he knew he would lose if he continued doing the minimum to prepare for Alex. probably thought that just losing the weight would do it.
Bruh there just talking. Where’s the bloodshed where’s the shit talk wtf is this?
COME ON DEJI RIP HIS FUCKING HEAD OFF!!!!! BUT BE SMART ABOUT IT AND GOOD LUCK IN THE RING MY GUY!!!!
oh man bless them these lads obviously just wanna hug and hangout
Intro goes hard!
DEJI FINNA MURDER ALEX
lmao this is  Awkward
cringe af
Damn, actually gained some respect for Alex, rooting for deji still but good luck to both 👍🏾.
Nah why is Alex making himself likeable and respectable. I’m supposed to hate this guy. Frustrating
Alex got this in da bag
I kinda like Alex he’s respectful yk but he seems like he’s trying to copy Logan in a sense with the turning one’s brain off like what and he only talking about the scale of the fight and now he’s gonna perform
He wont disappoint us. Right?
Lets goooooooo
Deji ko round 3 🔥
They're talking like it's a normal conversation with Alex just asking questions about deji
Look at Deji man, so inspirational
I feel like they were trying to lure each other game plan Thru this
Beat him up Deji 🥊
wallmart willne vs kseye
Bring it home deji lad
Ion know why but this video really made me wanna see Deji get knocked out. He tried too much to act hard and the Wassabi seems nice.
This is gonna be one of the biggest fights in YouTube Boxing
Redemption 🔥
Is Alex just to nice for this?
Alex's body language shows axiety, slef protectivness, stress and lack of confidence
For Deji It’s Like A Ride Or die Situation Go Hard Or Fail Deji’s Mentality Is I gotta lay it on all out there or im done for & With the Last two fights we haven’t seen that Moral
This may be the most calm face to face I've ever seen but I loved it 😂🥊
Alex is not looking confident
Deji has one last chance to redeem himself if he loses again it’s over
Isnt the guy in the middle from WWE NXT UK ?
Don't go easy on him he will take it as an advantage
C’monnnn DEJIIIIII
I’m not being biased but Alex just isn’t intimidating at all, his voice and his aura just screams teenage girl.
I love how they just started having a normal convo 😂
Alex's body language shows he's nervous, keeps fidgeting and even his sentences he keeps tripping up
Dejjiiiiiiii
I know This Video Upload from this Channel      But Alex Is My Vote So good Luck
Cool good luck Deji your the man
All the best to the Showstar with the event in the legendary Wembley Stadium and may the best man win! Looking forward to this awesome event!
this wasnt supposed to be this cool and lovely lol
Ngl, Alex lookin like a chew toy
This dude is not 31 XD
Look at the way Alex is speaking you can tell his clearly lying about his sparing
deji gon lose
Im gonna watch this illegally
Deji is a joke
Deji at some points doesn't look like he gives a single fuck about the face 2 face LMAO
Who can hear all the gulping 🤔
Which side you on this fight???  Deji vs Alex
I think deji is over estimating his work and thinking that alex hasnt put in the work like the old deji yet i think alex has also put in the work
You got this Deji!👊🏽
My guy have allot mouth braveee
Let’s go deji 🔥🔥
Respect to the guy mediating you did very well
lets gooooooooooooooooo
Alex is too nice lol
i have respect for deji
if deji chose the next fight as his redemption then why did he choose Alex wassabi? he has been mocking that guy from a long time ago. for him Alex was the easiest boxer. he just chose the minimum.
I love both these guys I wanna see a good fight that shows Deji has worked hard and made major improvements and I wanna see Alex be viewed as a good fighter
alex looks like he’s scared being to nice to the face😆😆
When Alex said "he gave me people to hard and not people that I can fight and he keeps pushing me'' Me: that's the whole point dumass
Alex is hiding behind his smile
This felt more like a podcast than a face off tbh😂
uhh i see scars on Alex's arms, does he self harm? i know its off topic but thats concerning and pretty sad
The host in the middle, your sleeves are driving me crazy. Fix them please.
I didn't even realize alex wassabi was that alex wassabi from wassabi productions that i used to watch when i was freakin 7
Can we app appreciate sebastian stan for doing the face2face
again deji started the smoke! XD . But anyway let's see. I'm with dej.
Alex is a good guy. I hope we get a good fight!!
If that black man disappoint me again i swear i delete my entire account
I actually have some respect for Alex now
It’s time to takakae
Thank God Alex isn't behaving like Bryce hall the girl.
1 minute in and I know Alex is gonna get clapped
its more like a ASMR
Here before 100k views
they’re just having a normal conversation
So Alex couldn't even beat the people he sparred with 😂😂
actually respect for both
Deji the destroyer 💪🏽💯
Nobody: Deji:  August 25th
Deji looks like he has the eye of the tiger watch out Alex.
Dej I believe in you brotha, love from the US
Deji u got this buddy
woke up to this
Come on dej. We all believe in you. Bring it Home for UK.
Their both just telling each other their game plan 3 days before their fight. Real amateur shit
So everyone forgot that Alex was given his whole career by the other wasabi guy
bruh they both just can be great friends they have good chemistry
I do like the respect but it feels kinda Cringy it’s hard to explain
They both seem like that would be mates outside of this fight   In 2 years they make a company together lol 😂
I’m loving this mans energy. TEAM DEJI!
Deji your gonna get banged 😂
Let's go Deji
Alex Wassabi is too nice I cant root against him man loool
DEJI LETS GO FAMMMMM
tbh i kinda like alex now haha but i hope deji wins so we see him in the ring again also hope to see alex back in the ring if he losses. With all said hopefully its a good fight.
This is cringy as
Let’s go DEJI❤️
My guy Alex has the best skin wtf
they really respect each other
I have respect for Alex
PogU
Do your thing lil bored 😂
C'mon deji and respect to Alex for respecting deji
lol they’re just having a convo
It's hard to dislike Alex tbh, I'm not really rooting against him. Just going for Deji. Hope it's a good fight.
yeee lesgo dejiii. Be humble and just shock everyone
If I hadn’t seen Fousey KO Alex in 30 seconds I would believe him that he will win, but after seeing Fiusey KO him Deji will make easy work with him
Why are they sitting like that😭💀
How does anyone take Alex serious about anything 🤣
Damn deji good at talking training 😂
tbh not a lot of people will go see this because of The Batman
Ayo anyone seeing alex's head look fat or big?
Think Alex is not understanding you don’t want to go hard all the time because your going to give your best rounds in sparring
Istg if deji loses Ima be pissed bruh
why are they slurping each other off
Bring home the W
The legend Is here
Ngl if Deji loses to Wassabi at home it's over for him
Alex Wassabi needs to do a drug test ASAP, I can tell when a bitch uses drugs to perform better
ofc im backing deji but... i respect alex for being honest
We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it And if you ask me how I'm feeling Don't tell me you're too blind to see Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up) We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye……
If deji loses this fight get stop please
Whys alex flirting with him
I like how Alex is impressed with Deji's weight loss. Wholesome hahahaha
Worst face to face ever 🤡. Just having a life story 1 2 1
Anyone got elden ring I could use
Yo mans cracking his head feeling like his the boss . But I know they respect each other . Actually Alex Wasabi is a PPPPPPPPUSSSIOHHHH
C'mon deji you can do it deji for the win.
Man Alex can be so awkward sometimed. I don't care if Deji loses or not, obviously the dub would be amazing, but if he does lose he's gotta keep going.
Alex looks kinda nervous he was cracking his neck which can mean he might be nervous or anxious but idk he might not be
Alex is trying too hard to show that he’s confident. Can’ see in his eyes he’s not confident very fidgety and touching face moving around, as deji is just calm and collective
Bucky?
lmao i start the video with an kfc ad
I love how at the start deji was a bit edgy at the start but as they spoke it was like two awkward friends who haven’t seen each other in a long time 🤣🤣. Much respect to both of them
did not expect a mature f2f. not much demeaning. respect to both
hope its a good fight, and not a paid one
What is simping from both ?!? This a BOXING 🥊 match not a therapy 😂😂 for me Deji is the winner 🏆 .
🤣
Alex is SO LAMEEE AND
Cmon deji we believe in u 💪💪
This ain’t the comedyshortsgamer Deji I know, this is “The Tank” Deji💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Ngl, deji is trying to act to act like a real boxer in this situation. Alex just chilling and giving him respect.
i like that theres some respect between them albeit i expected a handshake at the end
this shit looks soooo boring. No hype in this at all
First time I like both fighters 😭 idk what’s gonna happen hope deji shows up man and win
Who even is alex 😂 😂
can he beat goku tho?
Alex seems scared to really go in
This is trash
on a srs note, who tf is alex wassabi
Does anyone else cringe watching this
lets go deji
smh alex didnt show that same energy and is quite frankly flapping it
deji win by ko and alex is a nice opponent
Everyone that had their first fight and never been in a ring before had the confidence Alex has. And after the fight it changed and they realized its so not that easy. I think thats where Alex is right now and thats what he is gonna realize post fight. I believe Deji is gonna surprise Alex.
Deji stays taking those Ls's .Stop with the BS
I love how nice Alex and Deji are in this whole face-to-face session together
sheesh
They're acting like best friends 😂
this is the nicest most smiley face 2 face ive ever seen haha
He nervous as fuck, can see Alex wanting to shit a brick the whole interview
Deji vs that thing ?
sometimes alex makes me so mad but this was nice to watch . lets go deji redemption time
Eeeeeeeeeeee
Im on Deji's side obviously, but damn  dude, bit cringey sometimes, Shoulda been more chill
I feel like alex is trying to ease him til the fight with the respect and dejis not having it._.
Idc if it’s fake but for the love of god at least act like you don’t like each other 💀
LETS GO DEJI
Deji looks defo more confident, you can tell about the body language and I really hope and believe Deji wins this one. Respect to Alex aswell for stepping up for the challenge.
I respect Alex Wassabi
Alex is going to whoop deji 😂😂😂
Imagine the results was a draw
Alex is actually so nice, mad respect to him for respecting Deji as well
I love dejis attitude here. I LOVE ITTTT
Deji wanted to be more disrespectfull but Alex was being 2 nice so Deji didn't prepare weaker insult in his mind, u can see the clear confusion on his face xDDD
Pretty sure deji gets the dub here
Personally even if Deji lost idc what happens, it's not about the end goal that makes you it's the journey, and Deji's journey now has clearly gone so well. Fuck him up
deji gonna lose
Deji will kill him no cap alex is a walking dead man
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DDDDDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEJJJJJJJJJJJJJIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Idk why but this video really makes me like Alex Wassabi
my guy Deji just kept staring alex down not breaking eye contact for long
Deji will finally won against a youtuber 🤔
To be honest i think Deji lose but i don’t wanna see him lose
CMONNNNNN DEJI YA BASTARD
Wtf is wassbi doing
props to alex for all the respect he paid to dej
That was a good therapy session
deji has been in the middle of that ring crumpled and defeated each time. the fact he is going in again just shows the james webb telescope probably cant focus due to his balls
Alex looks very unsettled, very fidgety and trying to hype himself up by saying let's go constantly. Maybe he might show us different but he looks nervous from his body language to me…..
alex melting.
Deji doesnt look confident. Youll be surprised Wasabi can box
Lets go Deji! Fousey him up! 💯💯
man U better not lose deji giving me anxiety
These guys were taking the YouTube scene 8 years ago.. like holy damn it's super exciting to see two OGs of YouTube battle it out in the ring. After all I'm rooting for DEJI!!!
Alex has been figiting like a fricking Squirrel the whole time while Deji has been rock solid and been staring directly into his soul. I seriously have doubts that he can last 2 rounds now, I don't think he's as confident as he said he is...
Deji he's going to win
letss fucking gooo deji
Deji is gonna gas out and it's going to be hilarious
C'mon Deji. Lesgoo
Wasabi's interviewing skills 👏👏👏
dudes having a normal convo ahaha
lets go deji! you got this!
They so nice to each other 🤣
Im not joking but I had a dream that Deji was showing off his abs lol
Deji taking another easy fight to try and get a dub, yet again he’s gonna get washed because he’s nowhere near as good as people tell him he is
0:56
Alex is trynna be nice so when he loses he doesn’t get edited into instant karma videos lol
Most respectful face off ever
Come on Deji, please win this time. I have full faith
friendliest faceoff ever
Deji.. no pressure..just FOCUS
LOLOL
I think deji will win the fight because he kinda NEEDS to win or is career is over in boxing
Lets go deji you got this we are rooting for you
L
🖤
C'mon Deji let's get the dub💯
Why is Alex so cringe ffs 😂😂😂
Deji looks kinda intimidating ngl
I forgot how nice alex wassabi is, goodluck to both fighters honestly! Go Deji!
LETS GO DEJI
WTF IS THIS FACE 2 FACE WHY THEY DONT INSULT EACH OTHER
Team Alex all the way 🥳🥳💪🏼❤️
ngl i feel like alex is way 2 nice to box i used to watch him years and years ago and he was the nicest guy ever it's weird to see him box but i reckon it'll be a good fight to watch team UK all the way
🔥🔥🔥
W for alex for respecting deji's dedication and hardwork. Truly a humble guy
You can see deji's eyes locked on Alex, hope he kills this fight this time you got dej! Team UK for the Win!
I get nervous bad vibes from Deji here. I hope he is ready, but Alex seem so much more confident. I hope Im wrong, lets hope for a quick KO by Deji💪🏼🙌🏻
they seem to respect each other at the start
This is like a friendly conversation. Didn’t expect that.
Can’t believe this is actually the main event 😂😂 it’s a half decent co-main or even less. But main event with no other big fights?? Jeez 🥴
lets go deji you got this and kick his ass
If the Deji that we all know has that potential comes to this fight I believe he might knockout Alex Wassabi he looks really determined and focus but I like the respect they give each other. 💪🔥
He actually knows that if he loses he cant fight again that says something..hes got this
This is really happening? It feels like a comedy skit
CRINGE!!!
if deji loses im gonna kms
This is just awkward 😂😂 way too friendly, they both clearly don’t really wanna fight each other
KNOCK HIM OUT DEJI!!🥊🌟
The gloves are on
I would watch but I have better things to do then watching stupid youtubers boxing other youtubers or streamers fight a professional boxer  then come back and say that your fighting a professional boxer i would rather watch a professional boxer fight with another professional boxer  not this rubbish dont comment on this if you know what your saying ?????
Im hyped!! let's go deji
Therapy session for deji hahaha
Holy moly Deji looks readyyyyyyyy!!!
noooo rip long haired alex ✋🏻
Dang I used to watch Alex doing skits
they r litterlay having convos
Why are these two having a genuine conversation 😂
your gonna pump him deji can see it 🤝
DEJI IS FREAKING 16 KG LIGHTER THAN WHEN HE FOUGHT VINNIE!!!!! My God that blew my mind!
don't let us down
If it doesn’t go Dejis way, at least we can appreciate the fact that he actually put in hard work
Randy seen this coming years ago 😳
They have respect but you can tell deji wants to trash talk for more views and tension but can’t really
Deji pulls a Lars up foward 3 ring carry combo on his ass!
deji has too much pride it's a bit worrying, i really don't care who wins this fight but he really seems to always get too ahead of himself in these things.
dude this is the most chill face to face
Honestly big props to Alex for stepping up to the plate, even bigger props to Deji for not giving up! Both these lads have fire in them now its time to see the fight and see who has the greater fire in them!
Fucking hell that wassabi guy acts so nervous
Please, please, please, please be a good fight please guys c'mon now give us a good fight please 🙏🙏🙏
this was actually a good face to face, considering there YouTubers this was very professional. LESSGOO DEJI!😤
Here before miniminter has reacted to this
alex wASSabi
Never heard of Alex before but he is rly cool, i hope its a fun fight and the better one will win.
the
Come on Deji you got this, light work
Lets go deji bring the W
Deji's trying so hard to be disrespectful but alex is too nice lol
I have exams this week so when I get done I’m gonna watch this match. So excited🔥
I like how the room is set up to really show the viewer the fighter's expression and just enough body language. This invites any emotion to be at play. Also the camera angle/shot is positioned very well.
Alex looks scared as hell
As a day 1 Deji fan, if Deji loses this then I'm completely done with him lmfao, don't blow your 3rd chance Deji.
hii
holy shit normally i don't say things about peoples outside but alex wassabi sounds like a fucking girl ngl
alex is coming across WAY too cocky
Why are the chairs backwards
This is arguably the easiest fight deji could big. Good way to get back into it. Alex was bad against fousey and won’t have improved. 1st or 2nd round knockout
Wipe the smile of his stupid face
I RESPECT BOTH
Deji is so awkward omg this gooooold. Im deeeeeeeeeaad
I respect that Alex is just having a good time
no matter what alex or anybody says, deji still doesnt care, hell criticize anybody. I want deji to win but he is pretty cocky in this face to face
This man has really grown into a beast 🥊
14:55 Man is trying to pull at dejis heart strings lmao
Petition for lil bored to make a parody of this🙏
any one here felt abit of cringe 😅
These people are both my child hood youtubers  and it’s crazy to see em box and I’m here for it but team UK 🇬🇧 let’s goooooo dej don’t let me post another vid of  u right man?
Alex: your not learning combos  Deji: l am learning to box 🤣🤣👌👌
Deji don’t know how to deal with wasabi respect he thought he was gona dig him out but showed him respect deji ur getting banged
Alex wassabi looks great I can’t believe he is 31
"Oh i dont watch your videos, i wouldn't know" LMAOOO 😂😂😂😂
they both have so much respect for each other its like 2 friends talking to each other
Next time can you make sure to add *ASMR* to the title just so I know what I’m getting into
Let’s give a shout-out and props to the moderator. Super professional, charismatic and engaging or at least not looking like he’s dead inside 😂
Always been a supporter of Deji since day 1 love your grind and hard effort and sweat and tears put into this can't wait to see Deji vs Alex wassabi
I always believed Deji had What it takes. Unfortunately the work was just not there, i have higher hopes than ever for this one shock the world this time my man!
16:24 you can train everything but your chin lol if deji land clean punches and alex is getting rock
I respect them both for actually being calm talking to each other and having a solid conversation without any slurs and any egoistic shit like with some other youtube fighters.
I feel like Alex isn’t taking u seriously and looks too confident and kind looking towards the next opponent. Just stick to what is being taught to u mate.
alex is a nice dude man... i respect both but ofc deji has to win DEJIIIIIIIIIIIIII and alex ur not anooying and stupid.. so i wont hate u after the fioght like i had with jake paul lol
why is this the most tame face 2 face between 2 people who are about to beat up each other.
20:44 LAAAAAAAACK OF CONFIDEEEENCE !!!!! sheeesh
sounds like a friendly conversation
Here before Simon reacts to this in his twitch channel.
This is really awkward
Alex playing nice. This might be a tough one.
Deji is so much more mature in this video alone than all the video’s he has been in
I live in USA but I'm team UK all the way frfr
Dejis confidence now is another level, get the big W
I like how he said Rate jake 9 Rate vinnie 3 He shoulda said  “So ur a 2 or 1
Why is this so boring
Wasabi got a troll face
7:23 lmao
These guys both seem scared. Im backing Deji because he done it before
😂😂 deji came with anger and the beast face but alex is smiling and talking very nice, he broke deji’s character. That is funny 😁
Why does it seem like Alex's there to meet Deji as If they were friends and never met for so many years lol
This was awkward asl but I'm rooting for Deji all the way. He's got this!
Lets go Deji Team tank all the way.
Fucking hell - why don’t you just kiss ffs
let’s go alex got £100 on you to win
He’s gonna shock the world man.
Yessir! Team Deji!
I thought you guys were ucking each other off for abit can’t lie
Who does deji fight next?
Deji a psycho
Calm and collected deji
Alex looks nervous.
How can deji take about channels when his is just about dead as Alex's channel 💀
THIS DEJI HERE??
I genuinely think deji kept eye contact for like the entire interview with a few moments he broke it like he was staring him down so fuckin hard
deji trying to show a mean face, but hes just too nice , this wasnt face 2 face, was just two nice guys having a nice conversation
Do you have knockout power what a stupid question
What an incredible moment!
TEAM ALEX HERE??
This was sooo awkward.
I hope deji wins and I hope Alex continues with the boxing. Alex is such a nice guy
Nice
Alex was talking a little smack online but when ut comes face to face he turned up a nice guy..😂 I know he is a nice guy but still you know 🤔 goona be a good fight tho
but alex seemed to be a bit kind in the start right? deji straight up looking for a fight hahah even though i still respect it!
I thought they were gonna argue but I was wrong
What’s the date again?
Yeah I’m a deji fan but he doesn’t seem ready whatsoever. Wasabi gonna make him a meme
Just one thing deji, don't get cocky or over confident in the fight. Keep your mind on the prize and pull through.
Alex already lost he can't hold eye contact at all haha
That's not how you set on a chair!!? What's wrong with them!?!?
I actually want Alex to win. I didn't really watch Deji growing up. Been watching Wassabi Productions since I was a kid so I gotta root for my man Alex
sorry but i can't take both of these guys serious HAAHAH one guy lost to a goth dancer and the other lost to fousey tube OH MY DAYS
Lmao deji’s trying to act so hard but Alex is just vibing
DEJI DONT DISAPPOINT PLEASE.
Deji if you lose I'm killing my dog........in Minecraft
This is fine weird and awkward but cool Much respect to both deji and alex
Let’s go Deji💪🏼💜
want them both to win:(is that even possible lmaao.
The MODERATOR looks like Sebastian Stan
Wassabi: i trust every thing on my team. Wassabi after he loses: ITS MY TEAM'S FAULT
nobody: literally nobody: American fans that'll be supporting the UK
Lil Bored, FlyingKitty or Sir Froge will make a funny masterpiece in this video.
Deji win this lil shit
DEJIIII
You got this Deji I believe in you
Alex is 31 WHAT😳
Deji has got this in the bag! Seeing alex with no experience is so jokes XD
Deji has all the pressure
Good job done by the Host!
they are more suited to be friends
Wow amazing chemistry and maturity 💪🏻
I want Alex to win now
excited to see if niko gets in
Deji will shock the world
Guy in the middle sounds like white deji :) :)
Wtf this is boring
Deji is confident Mashallah
alex is 31, fucking christ
If Alex loses let me fight him I reckon that’ll be fun I no named average person versing Alex, I’d kill alexxxx set it up….
DEJI IS WINNING
You can feel the energy
19:13 👀👀
This sounds like they both are in a first date
17:20 alex is chatting wassssss😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If anyone here thinks Alex stands a chance your mad....
First question and Alex wassabi already make deji look dumb
Deji KO 3 R
Been waiting to see deji make his redemption. Let’s get this w🔥
Deji is gonna lose , cause wassabi has too much reach
I’ve never been so confident Deji is gonna win
I can’t take the beginning serious with Deji staring
Honestly this is just funny for me to watch cuz Deji looks so serious but when he talks he just acts friendly
Let’s go deji
Come on Deji
Don’t care
If I’m being completely honest if deji loses I wouldn’t be too upset because we know he actually tried to put in the work this time
Alex is to laid back might get cocky and give deji easy hits deji has been focusing on training for a while so he will make every chance vital big up deji for the focus and hard work for his training and dedication to the lead up to this fight bring it home
This is what I waiting for
deji takes no Ls, still gotta say Alex humble asf
It’s cool just to see them chat tbh
ngl this is very cringe
So this guy talks shit behind the cam but when he meets deji irl he starts being nice. By the looks of it, alex is scared og
Alex Wassabi talking shaky, meanwhile Deji over here looking determined and confident as fuck. Let's go Deji!!!
Love that Deji is calm and direct and god dammit if you lose again but I have feelling this time is different you got this Deji <3
Why they like whispering. Feels so awkward
This Alex kid is so cringe
I’ve been so gassed since the leak of this. Deji’s come so far man. I just imagine hearing, “FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE TANK, DEJIII!” We’re so proud of u man!
He say he is 31 how
Have a feeling it's going to end up as a draw.
Am I the only person in the US that is only rooting for some of the members of team UK😂
from ogus twenny fif.... to mawtch fif
Respect to Alex for appreciating Deji’s hard work
Why is Alex not acting like a douche here?
POV: you see a deji video longer than 20 minutes and get hype asf
Deji tbh u are a letdown (not supporting Alex) but who so you think you are? Staring at him Will not make u look confident. Deji you are a waste of time
Deji hit legendary super Saiyan
deji made him nervous asf already
What a sound face to face, they were completing each other! Great sports men. Hope Deji wins tho COME ONNN
If deji beat Alex then he should fight Vinnie then massive redemption knock Jake the fuck out
Deji losing 40lbs shows how dedicated he is, hope he brings home the W 🔥
*Ogus Twnty Fif*
Please win.
So happy to not see cringey disrespectful behavior
Lets go UK
Boxing face to face and they're just having a standard convo at the start, love that haha
this is goofy as fuck
This fight will be good. Deji looks soo confident. Deji knows that he has a lot to prove. Good luck Bruv
Respect for both fighters DUB for Deji!!
Finally ! These Face 2 Face are always so epic !! 🔥
Alex looks nervous to me he's faking his confidence all ho he seems like a nice guy
Alex sounds like Michael Jackson fam
This was sort of a cute face to face
When Deji wins, that will signal the start of a new man…
😈
U KNOW ALEX SCARED. HE LOOKING EVERYWHERE EXCEPT AT DEJI   DEJI GONE MURDER HIM MARK MY WORDS💯🔥
Let’s go deji!
🔥🔥🔥
Bruh what is this? a date?
Respect to both fighters. But I have to root for Deji this time. Lets go team UK.
Nah knock that sucker down man 1e round clear the job
find it so weird that they were talking like casual mates🤣
I started cringing when he said "do you want to fight right now" like he was gonna do something
Love deji’s emotionless expression looking like he just killed somebody. Meanwhile Alex out here sounding like a 12 year old boy just excited to be there. I think who’s gonna win is  clear.
alex got fake teeth
This looks so harmanic, this som asmr shit☠️
is it just me or Alex sounds a lil sus
Deji has to win there no other option
why is alex talking like he is friends with deji 😭
Deji - cool, calm, collected, prepared Alex - nervous, twitchy, contemplating, prepared
Deji if u win make a rap song I win that w!.That white boy is gonna lose.I will laugh again and again 😈
It's feels like they're on date 😂
As Alex said, he has confidence in his team, but i think he lacks confidence in himself.
I want deji to lose it'll be fun seeing him lose 3 times in a row
Alex : "oh you've not been learning combinations?"  Dej : "I've been learning to box!"  Straight up you can tell he's taking this serious.
To much respect, cmonbro i want action
ogus tweny fi-- oh wait, I mean mars fif
Let's gooooooo Degi
why they talking like best friends reuniting after 5 years
This is a sucking of contest
deji trying so hard to look tough. hes even putting a deep voice on
Hopefully Deji gets a trim before the fight
These two gave each other respect..Love to see that
its so funny watching that transman trying to be tough.
Win this
Ideal Scenario: ComedyShortsGamer blows through all the YouTube boxers and eventually rematches with Jake Paul, ending his reign of undefeated terror in the rematch and restoring balance.
Can’t wait to see this fight, we’re rooting for u Deji!!!
I thought this was going to be a cuss match and talking shit to each other, glad to see a proper talk and and getting to see what they've been up to
Feel like it's gonna end in a draw
You might not see this but go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Deji!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
sheeesshhg this version of deji🔥🔥🔥
Alex looks scared. Nervous. He keeps stretching his neck. Keeps twitching his body, moving his legs. He’s not ready.
Deji looks like he is LOCKED IN
I love both of them.. Alex is a good guy and Deji also.. The one who trained and more lucky will win we just need to wait.
The other nigga is gay or what💀💀💀
This is going to be a good fight LETS GOO DEJIIIIIII!!!
THE TANK
I like Alex after seeing this, he's a very nice dude just like Vinnie... it's a shame Deji has to go to war with these people.
Don't hear alex curse that much i hope deji wins
alex has changed so much ngl
We are all behind you Deji! Love you man and I know you can bring back the W, fuck him up man
This is so cringy
Deji "ultimately" olatunji
wow.
This would have been so much better with Wade in the middle. But this guy was as average as it gets.
I've gotten the impression from watching training videos that Deji could actually hurt Wassabi pretty badly. Could be a big mis-match.
They look like lovers but lovers are fighters.
Is this a counselling session or F2F?
Ok if I'm being honest I rly want to see both the versions of the world one here Alex loses and one where deji loses no offence to him man it's just I'm rly curious
Lets fucking go Deji! Its time man!
Man this is cringe
Alex is an amateur giving up all his secrets
Alex is actually cool and isn't tryna act aggressive and cocky and you can tell at the start with deji's tone he had a more serious tone compared to Alex, Alex wasn't even talking back
Deji please don't dissappoint me  you lost to Jake Paul in 2018 and you lost to Vinnie Hacker in 2021  please win Deji
LETS GOOO DEJI!!!!!
Let’s go deji!!! Don’t let us down man xx
why are their chairs facing the wrong way
CMON DEJ ALTHOUGH ALEX SEEMS RLLY NICE
This the most peaceful face 2 face I’ve ever seen haha
Alex drops deji 3rd round
Alex seems to be showing confidence but not feeling confident, and deji is totally in the right mindset this time let’s see the dub March 5th🔥🔥💯💯
No one’s talking about how fousey beat wassabi 😂
No one talking about how they’re both hiding behind the back of their chairs lol
I can see these two being good friends after the fight tbf
Deji looks ready I love it
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Deji did look kinda worried when Alex talked about his training periods. But I root for Deji. I hope he isn’t too prideful this fight.
Alex Wassabi is so cringe. His neck stretches, stretching his shoulders. Sitting there as if he has a boxing record of 20 - 0
Saw the leak, was waiting so long, let's see🔥
Alex is stressed
You Got This Deji! Bring Home The W! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
my only noticed is that ive never seen alex hit pads hard nor a bag when weve seen him work also he works pads alot slower than deji currently does maybe thats a small trick but still not a good thing to be doing
You both wassy holes 🕳
Am sorry I think Alex is so coky like he is to confident like he is under estimateing deji
Will they be wearing headgear?
Lmao what was that throat swallow at 1:45 🤣🤣🤣😂
All hopes and prayers to you Deji! Keep your head up
looks like two friends having a conversation😂
Alex is winning
Team UK ALL THE WAY
From USA still rooting for big man deji getting this dub
This wasabi guy is so cringe my god
Few minutes in and too nice and respectful damn. They should be more savage and mean. Anyway, excited to see how this fight will turn out.  Edit: Okay, I do like Deji's demeanour. Calm, reserved, saying it as it is. I see a fighter. Alex Wassabi seems a bit more laid-back about the whole thing. Doesn't seem laser focused, but is confident.
it’s a shame deji had 6 weeks with his new coach. Still i believe he will be good but i think he could be way better if he had some more weeks!
Lets go Deji Make us proud
If Deji shock the world again, I don't know what to say.....
deji u got this alex a lil bit**
Idk why this is painful for me to watch.
"i don't watch your videos i wouldn't know" & alex's quiet "ah okay" had me dead
Dis ain't a fight da fk
Deji is locked in
we're rooting for our Lad Deji. but man there was so much ass licking from Alex's side.
Who you guys got I’m goin with my buddy Alex
They both too nice lmao they don’t know how to trash talk
Yo is wasabi gay or something man talks weird
Deji… show them world who you are.
Even if Deji loses, he shouldn’t give up. He will regret being a quitter.
Alex is too nice to sell a fight lmao
I dislike your cocky side deji it hurts so much
Deji looks locked in
COME ON DEJI YOU CAN DO IT
Cmon Bradda u need this win
18:49 this is the first time i've heard Alex swear 😂
1:44 I’m curious of who’s gulp that was😑
Deji please hit gym every day even after the fight we always wanna see you in shape and confident this is your moment we love you
Alex’s voice IS SO INFURIATING OMG
First round win for deji
This was wholesome😐
You got this deji
This Is So Chilling For Some Reason 😂😂😂 Respect To Both Of Them!
alex +is just relying on his height and reach. that reach wont be enough to get deji away
wasabi is about to get his shit rocked
Who wasabi think he is lmao
Man i was so confused at the start man... That was awkward
Nothing more exciting than the fight and weigh in to see his transformation 😍
I hope he can see what Alex is doing. He's playing nice guy getting Deji to think "this kid ain't that bad" gets rid of the fire, the rage. You need to keep that you can't fight your friend you gotta be enemies
“August 25th”
theyre trying so hard to be hard on eachother vcfkn criinge lmao
❤️
so when are they going to kiss?
i feel like they will be friends after ngl
You see, this is what a real face to face should be. No pointless and petty insults, no interuptions just pure factual talk and no biased opinions. Respect to both fighters both have grown physicaly and mentally
Who's the Michael Jackson sounding guy?
I don’t know but the way wassabi is speaking , I can’t never take him serious
Deji and Alex casually having a conversation for the first 5 mins 😭😭
When 2 people want a good fight push themself man that’s gonna be maybe the best ever it’s like goku and vageta going up against each other wanting to get stronger and fighting on
You can tell deji is taking this a lot more serious than his last fights, bring this dub home 💯
SEX IS TEMPORARY, UKRAINE4EVR
Funny how deji was expecting and prepared for a heated exchange but wassabi was authentic and nice. Makes him seem more confident than deji ! Hope we’ll see a great performance from both 🙏🏻
Man was 93kg vs Vinnie and became 77kg now! Man's dedication  is unreal, hoping for your win Deji
I already got a bet on Deji to back out of this fight 👍
Big respect to Alex for being such a nice dude and supporting Deji and accepting the fight. He was being such a honest cool dude.
How many times did Alex stretch or try to crack his neck in this video? ☠
Letss goo dejiiiiii , plss win this one
Good job 😁😁
The true confidence from Deji is a great thing to see. Dude just stared straight through Alex's soul.
isn't it funny that we used to clown deji for all the stupidity he did and when he decided to fight someone we clown even more everyone suddenly supports him?
Team UK
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm literally dying, watching them talk like they're friends 😂😂🤣
I’m  in the school bathroom  skipping to watch this video
BRING HOME THE W DEJ✊🏾✊🏾
deji lets goooo
You can see Alex is nervous lol
Cmon deji!!!!!dont let us down
YAYYYY
I actually respect both of them so much they acted like professional.
Whenever Deji says "We'll see on (date of fight)" i get flashbacks lol
You don't need to win to redeem yourself Deji, just go to war and do yourself proud! I'm team Deji but I wish u both a good fight and good health after the fight.
I like deji and he’s going to win but Alex cut is 🔥
Get the W Deji, bring it home!  Alex seems like a nice lad, hopefully some bridges will be built after this fight, best of luck!
LETSS GOOO TANK!!!
Alex is the worse trash talker
I think Deji's gonna win.. But, it's get more interesting if Alex wassabi Win.. Alex kinda deserve more in this scene tbh
Alex wassabi is too much of a nice guy
Fucking hurt him i beg please this guy is a joke im paying to watch this i swear if you don't win they put up at least a good fighter
Alex Wasabi is a class act still he speaks well I’m looking forward to this fight I’m backing Deji still but It’s gonna be good for us.
i love that you can just see Deji`s icon on the bottom right corner 😂
Yooo
Can’t lie Deji is going to win fasho
who else has been waiting on this video ?
DEJI DO IT THIS TIME LET GO
I can’t lie if Alex fights like an amature. Boxer and fights on the outside just throwing one twos and landing and not even looking for the knockout then he has a massive chance to just beat deji on a decision  If deji actually surprises me then fair enough but I’m betting on Alex for unanimous decision sorry guys😂
Alex looks respectable tbf.
If deji lose quit YouTube
COME ON CUPCAKS
Deji has changed and I love it, can see how much more humble he is!
He said what would you rate me out of. Didn’t you lose to robocop er I mean fouzzi tube
Is this a fácking joke 🤣
Good luck to you both.
Team deji
alex just seems like a kid even though hes older but deji is more mature and knows what hes talking about
Ima say round 4 KO for deji. You got this absolute Tank!
Deji getting a W for sure
I'm so hyped for this!!
bruh deji didnt look away once
Alex will not win. Deji wants it more. Clearly.
12:06 nahhhh
when is it?
Literally a friendly convo 💀
Nice press conference no one has left this and made a mug out of themselves
16kg weightloss fairplay deji
LESGOO DEJI
who tf is swallowing like that ?
Is it just me or is Alex literally just a fan boy of deji's
Let's go deji you have worked hard for this and you need to win! We're counting on you mate🔥🙌
Props to Alex for being a good sport
Les go Deji 👊
What is alex going to do😂😂😂
First video I’ve seen Alex Wassabi not look like a mong
Ooof, Deji is on this one. Going to be an interesting match, Deji can win this you can tell he's put in the effort and it's going to pay off.
Deji kinda toxic sheesh!
This feels like two friends just competing against each other
Come on deji so proud of you after watching you for soooo many fucking years you doing bits
this cold demeanour of Deji is smth I‘ve been waiting to see since the Jake fight, I know he‘s gonna win simply because of that look in his face
Betting on deji
If Deji lose then he should probably stop boxing and ends his youtube boxing career immediately, so im really quiet anxious about his fight ,he must win !!
Good luck Deji❣️
Is March 5th the august 25th of this generation?
March fiffffff
Why were you talking to each other like friends 😂 this was so weird
LETS GOO DEJIIIII
Deji taking NO SHIT nor L’s He’s gonna fight and Win!  Let this comment be known 🏆🏆
AYO THAT INTRO SONG BANGS, WHAT IS THE NAME?
deji is gonna get smacked bruhhh it’s gonna be sad
Let's goo Deji ur gonna knock him tf out
YES YES IVE BEEN WAITING LONG FOR THIS AND FINALLY ITS HERE! THIS IS GONNA BE A GOOD FIGHT AND EVERYONE IS COUNTING ON U DEJ WE BELIEVE IN U WERE ROOTING FOR U DEJ
I hate Alex so much and i don't even know why
"Work in silence let success be your noise."
i want deji to fight jack again
Alex looks shook in my opinion, Deji looks stronger mentally here
3 mins in and i don't wanna continue this, can't stand his voice..
Deji Is Jokes Nah Man I Don't Watch Your Dry Videos 🤣🤣🤣
Lots of people saying Deji has matured a lot. I just don’t see it. He’s still over confident and underestimating his opponents. Still too cocky
when someone loses this is a big L for them . I think if alex lose he's going back on tik tok 😂
lets go finally a face to face been watching the leaks
Cmon Demi u can do it
Ngl I expected alex to just keep being like “you got winded you lost to a tiktoker exe”
Alex Wassabi is the most socially awkward guy
Notice how Alex didn’t mention power and speed when talking about advantage
The amount of gulps wassabi taking.. Man's nervous 🤣
DEJI
I'm sorry guys but you might hate me for this. I think alex is going to win, you can like this comment after deji losses, because, I see something which you people don't, I felt like alex was way more relaxed than deji, I just hope that my prediction goes wrong, because, I want deji to win but unfortunately Wasabi is taking this dub.
Cm'on Deji!!!! We want to see that W💪💪💪💪💪
Come on Deji let’s do this
e
This is your time, make us proud
At least there respecting each other and know its just for the fight not really any hatred
*The most wholesome face 2 face ever lol*
Why they acting like friends
Ngl, but Alex seems to be very respectfull during this conversation
Deji a W
let’s GO DEJI
93kg -> 77kg WOW! Respect Deji
Why is this low key wholesome
This felt so weird🤣 nonetheless you got this Deji💪🏾
march 5th is the new ogus twenny fif
March 5th instead of August 5th lol
Aight when are they gonna kiss each other XD why're theyso friendly WTF 😂🤣
Already 9 minutes in and Alex is feeling the heat taking the shirt off, being real fidgety with his hands going around and to his face and taking sips of water, while deji has hardly moved and is just so composed, to me deji has got this win in the bag
from the first second of them being face to face, Deji has NOT took his eyes off Alex. He is burning a hole the size of Ukraine's air space in Alex's head... He IS in War Mode.
Huge 💀💀💀💀🤣?
Most awkward face2face I’ve ever seen, so family friendly😂
I feel bad for ths fight lol why deji and alex so nice ahhahaha
I actually shocked by Alex's responses! Its like he sorta wants Deji to win..
The most friendly face 2 face ever
deji looks so unhealthy
Aren't they supposed to be trashtalking? XD
Deji Will Definitely come home with a W💪🔥
BRING THE DUB CMONNN
dayum 2 minutes ago
they look like they are trying to not be nice to each other hahaha
I’m not even porn in the uk I’m was porn in the USA but I’m going for the UK
the nicest face 2 face  ever hahahahahhahahahahah
tank tank wank
Alex was trying so hard to play the ”nice” card, luckily deji was not falling for it and wont underestimate him
bruh this looks like a pillow talk HAHAHAHAHHAHAH
Let's go Deji
Looking at his physique Deji has improved a LOT! But as I noticed he still has a bit of fat on his stomach area (which means we still won't see him in 6 packs still😭) and tbh it doesn't matter since he's gonna win this one for himself, and the people who believe in him 💯 straight up my man is gonna shine like a lightening bolt on pitch dark night 💯💪🏼.. Go get him! We believe in you! Team Tank! Shinzo sasageyo! 🔥
Most civil face to face I’ve seen
Alex seems like he has low confidence
Wassabi has been a nice brair since he started youtube, can't really hatehim but defo looking forward to backing Deji on the redemption tip
Just started watching it. Is this a date ?
Honestly i don't think they dislike each other no more its been so long since they beefed and i think everyone can see it
TEAM UK FOR THE W
6am fight time in Australia sunday daam thats early
Deji's stare is sooo intimidating, Get the win for us deji

This alex guy needs to get CLAPPED. I’m getting 2018 Jake paul vibes from him….
Why does deji look so pissed
I dont know why ,but I cant hate Alex.His face shows that he isnt a dickhead
Y this face 2 face is a friendly convo wtf

Should've been Wade hosting this. Hate to see him go out the way he did
Man, look at Deji he seems to be very confident and really took this seriously
Deji didn’t even lose eye contact .
I love that they actually respect each other but hate each other enough to be entertaining, March 5th will be fun to watch
wassabi got no chance, he knows he is fked
Deji will win no doubt in my mind
Alex just sounds like a fan what is he doing 🤣
lol alex getting cocky man got knocked out by fousey lol
THIS IS THE ONLY GREAT START TO GET DEJI CAREER BACK. MAKE A ALBUM SONG 🎵
Eye contact was constant throughout, Deji's got the upper hand.
C'mon do some drama it felt soo peaceful
Much respect to both of these guys. Hope Deji wins this and finally redeems himself.
I have a lot of respect for both these men I grew up watching both but I’m rooting for deji

Why is the interviewer sitting like Aladdin on his carpet?
Do you guys know if deji has a nutritionist? I think his transformation would be better had he utilized one from the beginning.
Wow 2 friends having such a friendly  conversation
Man said I don’t watch your videos sorry lmao 🤣
I hate face to faces I cringe so hard
I'm rooting for Deji, but i just hope he doesn't underestimate Alex...
When the person said what do you think of Alex I thought Deji was gonna say like a little bitch 😂
Why they flirting 🤣

its so awkward between them, but they are still friends
Dejiiiiiiii💪💪

Let's go we are rooting for you Deji
I feel like no one is appreciating Alex's respect for deji
Wassabi is too afraid to trashtalk deji in front of his face lol
Why was this interview bare awkward 😂😂😂
It started kind wholesome tbh
Alex looks like he knows he’s gna lose. But respect to him for the appreciation he’s showing towards dejis dedication to this fight. 💪🤩
I've been waiting years for alex wassabi's face to get fucked up..
Can I just say, THEIR VOICES ARE SO DAMN SOOTHING, LIKE FAM I’M FALLING ASLEEP
It's wierd to see them talk like that "yeah um your nice" but I'd fck u up tho"
Deji lost 40+ pounds, shows that he actually worked hard and took this seriously for people who still don't believe he didn't train
At the start it seems like they respect eachother and they seems like friends LMAFO
Only 3 min in and its already the weirdest face to face ive seen lmao
Alex is like : I respect u deji I like u Deji is like : I will murder u Alex
If deji loses......
WHY THEY SPEAKING LIKE FRIENDS RATHER THAN FOES FIRST 5 MINS WASSABI IS BEING TOO NICE
Alex bout to get CLAPPED
YOU GOT DIS DEJI
Yess
finna be li
Deji looks so serious it shows how much he has matured because old deji would  be smiling but not today he looks calm and collected. Let's get that W deji!!!
Cringe
Deji is fucking locked in 😂😂. Tbh Alex seems like a really nice guy. still team deji all the way.
Deji has put a lot of work in this fight, he is in incredible shape and if he loses the fight then he still is in fantastic shape
I was bored af but - DEJI FOR THE WIN , LETS GOOOOO
This was a nice chat
Imagine Deji knocking out Alex on the first round lmao
Deji as someone who has watched u since 2014 its crazy to see how far you have come and what you have accomplished. Good luck for the fight mate.
Deji is a beast!
Limm😄😄
Deji gets the W!
come on i know Deji can win for sure this time.
Damn Alex fell off💀
Im a few minutes in and this is a friendly conversation 😂
I hate these. They are so fucking cringe
man went from 93 to 77 what a g
respect to deji for not talking shit in this face to face. hopefully he lets his physique and mindset talk in the fight instead of his mouth.
I love how Wassabi is just tryna be cool and calm but Deji just wants to act up for the audience. 😂👏🏼 LET'S GO DEJI !
Why was this so peaceful 😂
At the end of the respect to Alex
Were enemies when they started talking then slowly easies into them being mates hahahah
Why is Alex interviewing and being so nice to Deji
Redemption arc
It's difficult cuz wasabi is being so respectful. How do theu sell this fight😂.
If vinnie is a 3 is deji less than 3?
If you didnt know, Dad from BucketHeadNation passed away and really liked watching you fight and your videos for a very long time. Bring him back the dub while he watches for heaven deji you got this!
here before it blows up
We're rooting for you Deji!! THE DUB IS YOURS !!!!
Like here if deji is gonna win 🤝
Deji definitely got this, looks like a whole different person
both are very cool
Compare this face off to jakes face off, clearly Deji’s confidence has sky rocketed. Deji taking the dub 💪🏽
nicest face to face ive seen in a while alex is a pretty respectful guy tbh cant hate him
this felt like a blind date
Deji's got this 💪
Imagine sitting like that for 20 mins, just turn the chairs around
W EVENT I GOT DEJI FOR THIS
love how they're just having a regular conversation
First
They’re about to kiss
Deji is staring into Alex's soul I love it
Compare this deji to the, jake paul vs deji face to face, he seems pretty relax and confident tbh, I'm scared for alex lmao
Apehal ni cringe gile taik 🤣
You can see Deji has worked hard and improved himself. He isn't talking trash like he used to. You can see he is serious now and he will get W.
Come on deji! FUCK him up
The way Deji talks gives me Deja vu of his interview with Jake, just sayin'.
There having a talk like their freinds
Wassabi is gonna get clapped
This is kinda wholesome, i mean they are like friends😂
It’s like friends havin a chat😂
I still think if your cardio was there, u wuda smash Jake Paul mate  Don't burn out early rounds. Explode later rounds my guy
Just seems like they having a friendly chat
What in the siblings 'moms near so we are just passive aggressive' is this?
This is a sausage fest not a face off
Finish him deji
They’re being pretty wholesome. Tf? 😂
Seems like they got respect for each other.
Why is the first 5 minutes so friendly 💀
This ain’t no face off it’s a Make out session 🤦🏾‍♂️
ohhh
Team deji
77 kg damn deji!!!!
YOOO BOTH ARE HAVING A GOOD CONVERSATION! that's pretty insane! ngl
Nice face to face so far

DEJI FOR THE WIN!
Let's go Deji!!
second
W
Deji can get this dub
Agush tweny fif
Deji staring into mans soul
I think Alex will be in for a rude awakening. One thing Deji has in his favour is knowing what will happen when he is under the lights. Add to that the fact that Deji had taken this bout seriously, I don't think Alex will handle the power, the pressure and the boxing IQ Deji now has.
you can tell the funny editor guy will edit this
ZAMM
Alex is just another cringe American
Damn straight
ay yo, hoping both of them are going to have a great fight
August twenny fif
