11:29 randy putting his foot by the hole just in case he missed the putt :)
why does Callux look like he has the swing of an 80 year old man, like Joe Biden.
good match boyz
randy banking shotting the ball in off his foor on the 3rd hahahah
Why did yall take baby strollers and ur kids to the course😅
Still waiting for the golf shoes
i think they shouldve given randy the win cos they are always gonna draw
14:01 😂😂😂
Callux I also have leukemia and it is very difficult. Sometimes I want to scream from the pain so I understand you.
Wtf is a golf handicap i googled it and it made zero sense
honestly what a video😂 should have a million views
Dam this channel died died 😢😢😢
freezy to win!
Randy and freezy is so funny😂😂 can’t wait for more🙌🙌
Congrats to Randy on making Sdmn
Fire content
Callux is the definition of all the gear and no idea
Imagine needing a air up bottle to drink water. Unless u literally cant drink normal water then fair enough. Others that need it for fun are idiots
No two ways golf shoes would slap
that game was close, a real Callenge
randy kicking the ball in on a gimme is outrageous xD
There'll be tour players adopting the 'randy slice' soon
You wish lad. Vids are clapped. Stop.
So funny this guy
GEM
i saw u at winter wonderland
Randy i see that 😂🤣😂
Free Palestine
Id prefer randy over some one with anger issues 💀 lad you can hardly take a joke sometimes
11:26 randy trying to put a gimme and missing lmao
Cal, I'm not a golf expert but your body moves so much sometimes when you are about to hit the ball. Lowkey funny 🤣
Part 2 asap
Proper ogre that Randy guy
got no chance mate. make-a-wish ended some time ago for you
Simon hates you bro 😔
GOD bless the nation of Israel 🇮🇱
Cal fell off
Not anymore after the Spill or Fill your guts video💀
bruh haha I was so hyped when randy got the last putt haha
the boys have NOT seen the latest sidemen sunday! xD
Simon hates you dude
Simon doesn’t fancy you alot bro 😅
BRO RANDY PUTING IT IN WITH HIS FOOT😂
Never played golf, actually never even liked it. But these videos are so fun to watch tbh. Not making me wanna learn cause i will be shiet but still.
Great video - but Freezy needs to touch grass fr fr
Freezy won for sure
Good video lads, love seeing people getting into the sport ive grown up playing!! Should try a game called sixes its similar to this concept basically theres a max of six points a hole  - if 1 person wins hole they get 4 ponts and 2nd gets 2 (or if other 2 tie they get 1 point each) - if 2 people tie they get 3 points each - if all 3 tie hole they get 2 points each  Give it a try really good game for 3 people to play
Why is no one mentioning what randy did at 11:26 😂
Feel like I'm watching a top gear esc TV series and I'm generally enjoying myself, fucking class video boys ❤️❤️
Randy won tbh
JESUS randy looking good well done to him
good call to call it a draw seems it was always keep on going that way lol til the rematch lads
Callux looks like a older version of Rick shiels
what a great game!
camera man point the camera where they are aiming please and thank you
A troops golf channel is 100 %needed, any random 4 playing a round would be so entertaining
golf is fuckin shite
good vid it wouldbe sick if you have the troops
Randy ❤❤
Randy looking slim
The Sidemen could make a golf tournament for one full day and invite as much youtubers as possible to play golf for charity, similar to their charity match for football. I think this golf tournament would be sick
F of with golf videos
Has the whole of UK youtube picked up golf recently or something?
Can you make a new shoe for no two ways that looks good so I can get a pair Jordan 4s or Reebok Pumps weightlifter III’s get your designer dude to cook and make an infusion   Let me know when it’s out so I can send you some money   Black white grey and electric blue   I would have bought a pair but the current line up isn’t top drawer I want to support the brand but I want it to look fly I don’t want to wear chunky dog shit crepes just to show support   Make something sick and I will buy every colourway
Quality content. Snooker next 👀
pog
09:56 Cal and Randolph turn into a comedic duo
Great video!
STINKERRRRR
That ending was so perfect
Fell off 😬
Randy lost quite a lot of weight🙌
Randy's looking good. Keep up the good work mate
How did I get hustled into a Golf w friends video...
Absolutely love the golf content
This is a great great video 🙌
Is it me or is randy looking slimmer ?
It’s normally closest to the pin in a play off so callux should have won imo!
Never pull your trolley again 😂😂 and the fact that a new golfer gets a Scotty Cameron is so unfair 😂
Both of you should go
Randy should of won, it’s rigged
What a video part 2 is needed for sure.  Can you appreciate Freezys skills
you guys should make a golf channel
golf more golf
3 amigos havin fun, can't beat golf content with the lads 👑
U boys better make a golf youtube channel invite some guests like behz w2s simon vikk josh
Great vid Cal. Hope you keep doing golf vids
Randy AKA the sandman.  Class vid and great effort from all 3 of you
Randy looking good ! Good on him, what ourselves was this .?
NEED A PART 2, that was intense
Didn’t they both host a Sidemen video before…? Just call it a draw and have them do one for April Fools again lol
The golf shoes like a bit too much like Air Force knock offs imo, nice vid tho
11:25 that’s some shithousery  by Randolph there 😂
you've made me start enjoying golf and actually try it out myself
skip!
Randy is very good out the bunker fair play. Arguably the hardest shot in golf
More golf vids please 🙏
God damn Air Up. I got it... Its awful, dont waste your money XD
Yoooo! Randy my man you looking slim my boy. Keep it up 👍 🙌🦾🧔🏽‍♂️
Oooioiiiiii randy lookin fiiiiine
Randy is good out of the bunkers
Lux just looks frail
these golf videos have been so fun to watch please keep making them
Wow Ethan Payne has helped randy with his weight loss 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Randy the 🐐
Cal defo won
Honestly Callux for a while your video ideas have been good but the last 6 mths, man they've gone off, like properly next level. Not sure if it's just you can afford to do certain ideas you've had for a bit but haven't had the resources for or you've hired someone to come up with new ideas or you've just matured a bit in your understanding of what makes a decent YouTube video but whatever it is I don't really care as now I know that when a new Lux video drops there's a very strong possibility it'll be a real banger. I mean especially as a English YouTuber and so all the laws and restrictions you have to deal with compared to the American ones where it's so much easier to come up with crazy ideas and be able to do them, you don't have that luxury but you still release some of if not the best, most fun, different videos on YouTube. Keep it up man honestly won't be surprised at all if you hit the 10 million subscribers in a couple of years if you can keep the ideas and energy level the same. Oh never mind the fact you're started your footwear company on top.
this was such a good video, more golf content with the boys 🎉
Anyone see Randy kick it in 😭
Randy stop twisting your wrist
Cal, you drop back at the first point of entry to the water on the line the ball went in. Not where it splashed in and in line with that.
randys looking clean all round
thats a freezy dub just for that last putt
golf is such a neek sport its so dull
Great vid, Randy looking amazing too
The Buckinghamshire is such a good golf course!👌👌
we need more troops golf
More golf videos! Play with Rick Shiels!
Poor standard this
The golf channel we need
Callux closest to the pin
This gonna sound weird but Randy looks do hugable rn 🫣
Callux is too tori to be sidemen lmao
Finally some golf content! That course looks lovely too
Honestly with a non biased opinion randy won
Everyone been copying max fosh for how the vid ends
This video made me all warm and fuzzy. Loved to see you guys together in such a wholesome way.
i have been WAITING for a golf video
Calfreezy running being the funniest part of this video is completely uncalled for.
Golf videos just a walking podcast im here for it
such a epic end
More of these videos!!!!
We NEED the troops golf channel
I didn’t see anything, I saw everything 😂😂 actually a decent round I rly like the way Randy plays tbf need to make this a series
why’s this video only got 75k views
Imagine a goodgood & sidemen collab 😮
Sidemen/troops golf channel needed
These 3 are great together
Yoo Randy!!!!
Ngl freezy looking good in this vid
So who gets to be in the sidemen video, was it randy in the all sports golf?
Finally he is back
❤
Golf games looking tidy 💪
17:38 - 18:10 🤣 This was great vibes all vid. Just a bunch of friends having fun chatting shit and playing actually decent golf. That last hole was crazy. Cant wait for part 2!
This is the man version of men on walks with strollers.
Oof. Not getting off the ground with this video aye Cal? Lol
Randy gets out of the bunker better than my pops who’s been playing for 40+ years
Water is already so good, no need to add flavor.  Unless you're in a spot where you're boiling water
Randy losing weight?
LMAOO
FREE PALESTINE
It's a shame golf is so inaccessible. Such a chilled out enjoyable sport. Great video.
These golf videos just makes me want to travel to the UK to play courses like this one and ones I’ve seen over the years on the PGA tour.
This was so good, more golf vids. Absolute banger in my opinion! Btw Randy lookin slim ya know 👏
Old man game
364 ? 6:27
15:03 Sammy the sprinkler
What a good youtube title!!!
I think Cal did better than Cal so Cal wins 😂
Great video! Love the golf content!
hate golf. but love this :)
It’s actually mad that you drew twice! 🤣👏🏻 Seven Sidemen becomes nine…😅
11:30 randy using his foot😄
Respect to Freezy, playing for his Pa 🙌🏼 RIP 😢 He would be proud mate.
bro is 40 tryna join the sidemen is crazy
Great vibe from Callux, hope he does the sidemen vid.
The fact that golf has to do with hips and callux of all people is doing okay at it is just insane in itself.
12:50 is jokes 😭😭
Such a great video lol good vibes.
Bit of a dead video idea won’t lie
harry was looking for someone to edit this type of video loool
18:00 is the most unreal comedic timing. Poor Randy.
Randy’s looking short fam
Didn’t watch the golf vid, definitely not gonna watch the rejects vid XD
Golf content on the rise!! Love to see it!!
I wonder if Callux,Randolph,and Calfreezy all played Baseball⚾, who would hit a Home Run⚾
I'd like to see Another version of The Sidemen Charity Match, baseball ⚾ edition where if any of the players on either team hits a Home Run⚾ , it scores there team 2 points
Would love a part 2🙌🏽
Callux looks like Viserys Targaryen and Simon of The Sidemen looks like Petyr Baelish
I love watching these golf videos, I just wanna ask are the ball lines accurate or just for show? always wondered this
Damn Randy looking real good
Nobody wants that
More golf content with the boys please!!
Nice try… Still not watching golf thought
Free palestine 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸 🇵🇸
I never kept up with the game of golf but this makes me wanna play with some buddies. What a great video with really great players. Y’all are actually good ya know? Lol
Why do the sidemen think we’re having a midlife crisis n enjoy golf?
Such a good video
Some better editing could have made this video much much better, not hating just giving my opinion.  Could have had a map for each shot to show where the ball is going, alongside the actual footage. And could have also had an active scoreboard to show each shot
Callux your swing is atrocious
Please join sidemen
Wtf only 9k views in an hour is my app glitching
11:27 Randy making sure
would like to see more golf videos like this
yo has randy lost some weight? hes looking good yknow
