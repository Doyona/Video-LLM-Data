His outfit; Amazing! His style; Amazing His make up; Amazing His house; Amazing His hairstyle; Amazing His fashion style; Amazing Finn; Cute 🥰  All perfect! His personality is PERFECT too!!
You are honestly amazing, and your house is gorgeous
James Charles is my favourite
WHITE COUCHES?????? I don't get it!!!!!!!!  SO easy to get spots on!!!!!
It's nice, but I don't see your personality in the house. It seems like you are the guess. I would love to see your house with a make up that will scream that you are there. Sorry, I don't feel it.
LeClair is incredibly talented. Excellent job, team!!
Hi
James ur house is literally a mansion
i hard like 20B
Oh my god you’re my friend but why am I
Coke cellar. OH GEE I LOST IT!!
8:49,  James: perfect for the parents very far away   James parents: well ok then (‘◉⌓◉’)
you house was built in 2019 so it does not need renovating ??
I really don’t think your spoiled I think your like thankful for your home and things
yaassss James sister
That makeup tho
Not my taste at all but still super impressive for ANY age. I just feel like it looks like any CB2 or restoration catalogue. No character or anything unique. Where is the color?! Whatever games does not and should not care about my opinion lol but I just feel like this could have been so much cooler :(
Lone fox friends. Your such an amazing person love your style. ❤️💐🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
His dog does my dog is name Finn
The pantry is a little too organized. The point of the pantry is to have all your food unorganized so once you walk in you’re overwhelmed with food and hunger 💁‍♂️
She is loosing her subscribers 🥺
12:55
This house was on KUWTK when Khloe and Tristan were talking about Khloes new house

10:50 HAHA poor Theodore and his ball!
The sister house is so aesthetic
I feel like i entered pinterest
This house sucks! He even mentions himself we do not use this room, we do not cook we don’t do this that this that.... not a livable house to me just show!
Have you ever just looked at the mirror?
I liveeeee for the organization in the pantry
This literally  looks like rebecca zamolo's house 😵
This is problem my dream home LOL
Legends say James cleaned his house to make this video.
james’s entire house is literally a pinterest board ngl
I have never been so in love with someone's house before. His house takes the cake. I love love love his home. I will be using his house for inspiration when I renovate my own house.
It just clicked in. HE. LIVES. HERE.
and i want one like that
omg i love ur house ur so lucky i cant even  have one im 2 young
Can we just focus on how much drowny gold there is
Thank God for your Blessings! I am so proud of you.. continue to Love..That’s what God want us to do show love... 🙏🏾
I had a good laugh when James filled the wine seller with coke! 😂😂
I hate him but love this video lmao
It looks like a magazine 😍
me if I lived here: A wHoLe NeW wOrLd :D
Yes. The pantry area is called a Butlers Pantry! :) Most house that were built in early-mid 1900’s have Butlers Pantry’s for when the butlers and maids lived in the house. I know family members who have a butlers pantry but renovated it to a pantry or bathroom or walk in closet.
😒

His Bedroom and Bathroom is bigger than my whole apartment.
Damn man you rich rich.
So… I don’t support lgbtq or trans but… I gotta give him props for his outfit. And I love the house to 100% my style
Are you a girl or a boy?
I feel like i'm watching a pinterest house
Can someone tell me what "style" this house is? I like that you can look down from the stairs landing into the formal living room, it makes the home look large and open.
James: this tv I actually have never used this! me: what...
I feel like a proud parent watching this! I am so super proud of you James! Keep being awesome and a blessing to others!
imagine having money
Wow
It's just like Rebecca's home... It's soo same .. maybe it's same or maybe they're all the same maybe
Oh cococola haha no alkahole cute
Looks like James will probably have to sell his house now.
Me: *never forgets the first thing he says..”HEY SISTERS”
Your outfit and make up literally on point
his house is my aesthetic.
Only true James Charles fan remeber that the song James played on his piano was the first thing he played on the white sisters piano Grayson bought him
Your main closet realy looks like rebbeca zamolos wardrobe
I love his house it's so perfect for him it fits his personality
No entendí nada pero está bien chula tu casa 😊
Soy el único que habla español   Contésteme en Español porfis 😁

2019 was such a bad year for him. I'm so glad he got through it all . He's strong. I'm happy for ur house
🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋
This actually feels like a home and not an echoey white room
James and the Mom Jeans :) ---- (Love it)
❤❤❤
This looks like Rebecca zamolo house
Is it true he’s a boy?!
I have a doubt should I use he or she with this person ???
Seeing that James doesn’t have the piano that Grayson gave him when the sister squad was still a thing makes me sad.
my favorite part was the mini fridge in james room 💀
ويععع متحول ولابس لبس بنات مثلينن
I have the pendant lights in my sims home 💀
His backyard tho
По сравнению с ним чувствую себя нищим 🗿
Congratulations on your lovely new home and while you are relaxing, please READ: Apartheid's Insanity and Stupidity by Mateu Nonyane....available on AMAZON and TAKEALOT. Thank you for your support.

YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH. I FORGOT. KUNDALINI PPL ARE BEING POSSESSED AGAINST THEIR WILL TO SHOOT OFF BULLYING MIND CONTROL. SO I HOPE IT ALL WORKS OUT WELL. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A FREE MONEY SYSTEM & BE VEGAN ETC.

Your home is stunning
James: were giving away 100k dollars! Me in shock: turns off IPad and goes crazy
man how do you work for james charles, getting paid and live in his multi-million dollars home, not to be creepy but that’s low-key a life goal
OMG THAT  HOUSE IS AWESOME !!!!!!!!
WHAT ARE YOU ? A MAN OR A WOMAN !!!
Wow wow wow
Very nice 🏆
"They literally organize your house." Yes we are called Virgos :)

aesthetic house james 💕
Beautiful house you have. But, okay I'll keep it to myself ☹️
So empty and white and echo-y. I hate houses like that.
Where did he say he got the chairs from ? I love them they are so cute 😍
hijames
A perfect place to fly out his victims to hang out with him
my Goodnessss
I am happy he likes it, but there is not a lot of anyone specific in there. It looks like a hundred other beautiful California homes. Monochrome and predictable. MEH! Already dated. No personality.
James your house is amazing omg I am sister shock
i cant say this house dont look good. its amazing. now. i dont really watch this channel so i cant say i know anything, but assuming hes the only one living there, i dont get the point of having such a big house. even with multiple people. it must have something to do with the fact that i grew up in a normal house and im just used to that as well as the fact that i dont care much about money but... really?
IF you guys take a look at Rebecca zamolo's house tour you'll see its the same design as James House so I think they might be neighbours
Are you a man or woman? I didn't understand your loud
Do you buy this house 🏠 and people help you put the thing in? Please tell me. I love the house 🏡 , so clean 🧼
Chaka😁
It kinda looks like Rebecca house
Simply fantastic, not like houses here in Italy!
I’m going to have a house like this in the future, I claim it, and now I’m receiving it ❤️🙏🍀🍀
I wish I lived with him and we shared this home together. I'm a YouTuber, entrepreneur, author, and so much more.  This is so inspiring!!!
So organize and just lovely
those sliding glass doors look so expensive, even the way that they slide sldfsfsf

is it just me or does james first floor kinda looks like remi cruz’s house?
Sister James could be a real estate agent-
It looks like a really big version of Rebecca Zamolo’s house like the closet is like the same and some of the features of the same
Wow this must be in the same area as Jenna Marblems house  or the same builder. It has a very similar layout and features as her house. This is an amazing house to own at 21 keep on going up.
As beautiful as the home is, it’s actually quite boring and soulless 😬
I'm living in a villa it is big but u live in a maison bigger than my city

I think this house is about 7M but the interior would be probably....20 M BUT idk im not sure.
Wow. James had really done well for himself. Good for him. Hopefully everyone reading this will get rich and successful one day too
This house is amazingly huge and so beautiful! Love the way everything is decorated! Such a beautiful home! ❤
Jesus loves you and he cares for you. Pray to him, he will take you to heaven. He died on the cross for you. He overcame the death and ressurected from dead to live. He can give you peace when you start talking to him. Read the bible and he will show you new things 😘 God bless you, he always hears your cries
What can I say? Unique! Unique! Unique! Looooooove!!!

Wastecedit
If I own that house I will put a bathroom in there not a wine cellar
Hmmm, house design and “tour” & “intro” eerily similar to Heather Dubrow’s house 😂😂😂
Looking at James I find that hard work really pays off😻
LOVE that house
Who watching this in 2021
I'm 21 and i can't even have a 50 square metres apartment on my own

I don’t really know james. Just know he’s a makeup guy. His house is amazing though. Love the aesthetic and the style. I’d do it for my house less ostentatious version
He would make a good real estate agent
He has almost the same house as Rebecca zamolo
I love that James doesn’t brag or try and make people feel bad about their house. He’s so welcoming and genuinely just wants to show us the hard work he spent creating his house! <3
Literally my dream house!
James house is simple and humble while jeffery’s is too much
You know it’s a big house when you need a part 2 to a 17 minute video giving a tour
Are u she or he with gender ar u 😭😭
BUT CHARLES LIFE ALONE

Me after watching this : hey google how to become famous and be one of james friend
The used weasel occasionally irritate because cormorant geometrically bore down a oceanic smoke. elderly, anxious john

Coca-Cola should sponsor you. Periodt
James Charles real estate
Summary: James doesnt use most of his houses rooms.
Does he have OCD or something? His house is so freaking clean and organized!
I mean...its nice but that house kind of big for one person. Do you really need so much space? It's like throwing money away.
No hate to James at all. Love him to death. But didn't he give a house tour to a place he bought like a year ago or is this the same place and I'm dumb lmao?
I love your content! Keep up the great work :)
YOU'RE HOUSE REFLECTS TO YOUR PERSONALITY 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The piano is so, so beautiful
james and his team are LITERALLY IN EVERY ROOM ALL THE TIME.
How much is the total cost including renovation for this house?
This house is too clean 😂
Nice house...may i know the all paints used in this house...?
This looks like Rebecca zamolos house but without the basement
his house is bigger than my house, publix, and my cabin-
You deserve this so much, but my favorite part of the house is Finnigan 🤣
You home is avakin life
James Charles is unique
This music cushy- sleeves is amazing and also the home and the owner too 😁
Influencer house in avakin life
The tv is off by 1 inch to the left
Tbh it looks like ikea but bettterrrr

It looks amazing and homi
He or she?
You home is absolutely beautiful however for a person in fashion maybe a pop of color would be nice in the home. I think as you add more of you to the home the sterile white will become homey. 💖
Hey! 4:35 this is where James played Among us!!
Be honest for me I love master bathrooms
I have the same ladder shelves in my bedroom but they’re white
James Charles rlly deserves this
I'm 14 rn, I wanna be this successful one day. I want a house as big as this  Hope everyone gets wealthy someday.

His house is so aesthetically pleasing
He is transexual ?
The rhetorical defense supply crush because gore-tex methodologically point round a spotless design. demonic, squeamish gum
This guy is 3 years younger than me and he already has a house like this. And I have just nothing :)
Это Нереально круто!

Wow sister
I don't need big houses, giant bungalows etc What I need is happiness and peace in life Be grateful to God about what you have because alot of people doesn't have that and struggle for that What about kids who walk on floor with naked foot and sleep on road, we have a better suitation than those people
And I thought his old house was good. Ok, ok this is my favorite house EVER... lysm James! ♥︎♥︎♥︎♥︎♥︎♥︎

Beautiful house
this made me feel poor on a whole other level
James do you want kids? My number one question.
Me: has to talk about each piece or leather on my shoes to get to 20 minutes in my house tour James: does not show 3 of his friends rooms and makes a 2 part house tour
The only thing I don’t like about the house is that I don’t live there😞
eres  hombre o mujer
this is such a nice house (:
I feel like i'm watching the block or mtv cribs lmao
okay i actually found my dream house . you house is literally everything i wanted in a house omg and when u open that outside door do you not get flys in your house 😭💔
I don't know who you are and I guess 24 millions people know you better lool. All I can say is that you are a light and so positive. Thank you for this beautiful home tour, you deserve it all, sending love from France ❤❤❤❤❤... OMG there is a part 2!! Cooolll
I'm searching for Graham coment
This has became my dream house bthnx for that
Your house so beautiful
It’s kinda hilarious that like when our parents were kids they are in the living room to watch tv and cartoons but this decade wants to eat in the kitchen and hang out in the kitchen. *and they call us obsessed with electronics*
Thats a remodel of Rebecca Zamolo house
James bathroom is like the size of my room hahahahaha 🥲🥲
Bruh where I live a house like this would be 700k
My friends: OMG YOUR HOUSE IS MASSIVE Me: *watches this house tour* uhhhh u sure bout that?-

If you ever have to list the rooms in your house to a police officer, make sure they know exactly what you mean by "coke cellar".
Soooòoooooooooooooooooooo many clothes😬
Baddest bitch ever !!!!! I love James!!!
Absolutely stunning home to match the stunning owner. One question- can I move in?
oh to be successful
I may not be a James Charles’ fan but the way he decorated and introduced his house is amazing
I love the fact that he didn't want to show us the room of his friends because its their space, i mean is his house hi owm it but he stills respect that
I stan!!!!!🤍
i was impressed when he started playing the piano like damn..
Do you get periods  Cause you are not a boy you are a girl 😂😂😂😂😂
The fact that he had to make 2 parts of a house tour shows how giant it is
How can anyone hate him?

I'm not that much of a James Charles fan ( loved instant influencer tho)  But this house is totally amazing. The layout and the design and the way it is decorated is beautiful
Honestly i pity this man..it is sad how far you can go for money and fame.

Well congratulations for your new house. Any plans for gender change!?
This house is so similar to Rebecca zamolos house
top...top...

What I think about the new house of James is that is it amazing from the outside and inside and one is that I wish to have a house like James.

15:46 what if when rain 🌧 will com all the sofa 🛋  WHAT WILL U DO THEN JAMES
Love the house, but his outfit.... NAHHHHH I don't like it. A cropped vest with a blazer and jeans like what the actual heck. The outfit just doesn't work but if that's what he wants to wear then he can but it DOES NOT look good. Lysm James
How does he keep this house clean
First time watching James Charles' video and...    THE SONG IS UTTERLY EPIC AND IT GETS BETTER WITH HEADPHONES I CAN NOT-
I like how Finn photobombs like the entire first half of the video
my gosh- the house is just- a m a z i n g- So cool-
What a gorgeous looking guy...good luck to him in his new home x
SLAYYYYYYY THAT HOUSE IS AMAZING!!
My dog has the same dog toy.
Could you do a separate video or even a pic of the blueprint of this house pls?

The colors included in James's house is mostly pink and white and the cupboards are a really nice shade of brown and just the decorations in general matches with my aesthetic ✨
I wish this house was mine, but it's really nice '
Congratulations,  so beautiful
Imagine playing hide and seek here 😆
So can we talk about his outfit and his makeup 😩👌🏾perfect

Ashaunti Smith 24 Dallas, Texas  Insta: itnuahsaaa  Congratulations on your beautiful home! You deserve it and more. If I we’re to win this amazing giveaway, I’d first finish school so that I can finish up becoming a teacher. I am also a mother of two beautiful blessings, Alaena (2) and Amarey (5months) and would be able to do more for my daughters. Lastly, my fiancé and I have attempted to get married for 3yrs now, but our finances have stopped our progress. Winning this giveaway would help me and my little family so much.

I like how he's sayin' look how beautiful, stylish and big my house is, and to la yg an extra layer on just that there GOLD bars on the shelfs. Just casually layin' around the house.
His master bathroom is like my whole living room

I love the light blonde color of the cabinetry.   Can you tell me if it is a stain  or a paint?  I was trying to buy a painy but it is too yellow.   Mixing Paint is so tricky.

James charles house is so similar to Rebecca Zamolo's
Huh?!    WTF is YT recommending this crap to me for?

Me spotting the ZHC bag in the closet: :ooooo
LOVE THE HOUSE DID ANYONE NOTICE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE REBECCA ZAMOLO
Us realizing avakin life  copied james house....
Me: the out door fireplace looks like a massive tissue box!!!!!  Everyone else: nope just you.
To be honest, I think my favourite is the walk-in closets. They are GORGEOUS
The house is so peaceful and inviting. I love it!
I actually don't like the house :/ sorry James, no disrespect meant..don't come for me everyone..its just not my personal taste preference..I just don't like a lot of the color schemes, and I think the combo of the modern with the woods/browns just seems off, idk, I can't put my finger on it..James I guess I was also expecting more splashes of color throughout, being that you love makeup and color in general...
Beautiful home. Congratulations. 🥳🥳🥳😍😍💯
Beautiful home... furniture are just on point for the space! Love it..
I want to be his guest forever👁👄👁
Congrats at 23 million james also luv the house

Beautiful space but design style and layout looks and feels similar to the home Mr Kate did . Looks like a refresh on the that prior design on a bigger budget.
The decor is exquisite
What in the ‘modern minecraft house’ is this
Dude, i know your house better than you because i have a house named influencer mansion in avakin life.....that mansion is a copied version of your house.....
Beautiful😍
Jamesssssssssie boo
Those clothes look so dumb lol
The guest bedroom reflects that how much will you take care of your guest .  The master bedroom is like my dream bedroom .

Sister James' whole house is my entire Pinterest dream board lmao....
everyone whos reading this,,,,may you and your parents have long life. . . . .
Subtítulos en español por favor!
You need bigger nightstands, those are dwarfed. Same with the round mirror in the foyer—too small. These rooms are massive; scale is important.
Wow first time watching this gal/guy & the hands are just..A LOT. Back to watching...
I love his house it’s so beautiful
Why does it sound like he was trying to sell this to me... I mean I would buy it from him
The master bathroom is bigger then my bedroom...
Omggg the piano skills thoooo
Love it!!!
Perfect! A dream house ❤️
Oh James, your home is absolutely beautiful. I wish you much happiness and many treasured moments x

Vim Do Avakin Life (alguém do Brasil?)
I love the simplicity of the house.  It’s not overdone.  If I could ever afford a home like that, it would be my forever home.
He talks so fast
You see anyone can do huge things
How much does the house cost
Who is here from Avakin life after realising that the latest home there is modelled from JCs home.
Love you sister
James please promise me that you will be careful with the laptops on the bed cause heat and donna is not a good mix (fire)
James Charles is literally the definition of self made period
I do not know who this guy is. YouTube´s logarithm send me here. This is one of the best houses interiors I have ever seem in my life. Not only beautiful  but organized af. Inspiring.
I was so amazed that he didnt even breathe while talking and and i am catching my breathe for him😭😭
This is just a reminder of how poor I am lol but congratulations James you worked really hard to get where you are and you deserve it. I wish you and your new lovely home the best😁 maybe one day I’ll be able to have this as well not that I have any talent though I also have 4 dollars to my name😂
Where is the makeup room??
OK I am planning my future to get a house so can you tell me where you move to and what location those type of houses are at🥰🥰
More power to James!  The will to have a home is to be greatly admired 💕 So nice and clean 😊 Best wishes 🌹
Congratulations James! I remember watching you years ago and you saying how it was your dream to buy a home! Well deserved x

I love how when he says this is my every day casual closet it’s literally bigger than my room
Very nice to see a young man succeed
i love this house and yaaaaaaaaa
So he need to pull every cushion on that patio in? When raining or he just let it be?
Wow what a dream home!!😍😍👌
Dang James Charles has good music
Wow ! Love your house tour definitely gave me ideas on what I want in our first home! My husband and I are newly weds and its been crazy looking for the perfect home or atleast something we both like 😂
anyone have an idea of who the artist is for the video music or anything similar? watching this solely because of the little music snippets from graham’s react video haha
Beautiful  love  everything 💜💜

James is so frickin TALENTED.
Does the patio furniture get protected when inclimate weather happens?
Love how james's dog just showing his happy face

La casa de mis amados sueños
Congratulations
Bath tub is in wrong place. Others - love it.
I could never describe my dream house until I saw this house tour, and this is literally it! I re-watch this occasionally for inspiration for my own house as it completely emulates my style and how I want my house to look. Today I'm re-watching it for lighting inspiration :D
Random person- HOW MANY BROTHERS YOU GOT?  James- None  Random person- HOW MANY SISTERS U GOT?  James- *22.5 million*
my dream house

Any target dog mom, knows that Rainbow toy is from Target lol
There is no other person who deserves this house more than James. You are the best!
I love that bed and living room
I thought you already bought a house in 2019 and Mr Kate decorated it??
i loved it!
Why is James Charles bed short in length not breath? He is tall so how will he sleep?
The house is absolutely beautiful!!! Especially the master bath!!!💜💜
You what James you better, with the piano play!!!!!

What's the name of the dog.the cute little dog running around

The coke cabinet
I’ve never been so jelly 😭
Very nice house
I love it ! It is very beautiful like James Charles
I don't understand why I keep watching these videos. I try to stop but I can't and then I get super jealous and then fall into a loophole of just searching up the best way to organzine and redo my house until I realize I'm broke.
I love your house.
So beautiful house.
Is it me or does JC look like Erica Mena🤔
Your closet is bigger than my room
This is literally my dream home I’m just gonna kick you out and move in😄😄

What kind of interior style is this?
“There’s a his and hers sink, but rn it’s just me using it so it’s his and his” even if someone else was using it, it would still be his and his lol
i wish james could notice me
You should have filled the coke cellar with 2 liters or 1.5 liters
james master bath is bigger than my room and closet combined
Why does he speaks so fast? I can't understand a single word. 🥺🤦‍♀️
This kitchen/pantry/ lounge layout reminds me of Jenna marbles house

James, I'm so very proud of you for all of your success,  your home is beautiful and so are you! You're my hero 💞
I just found your channel. Like why now?? I am like so crazy about you. I follow you everywhere and I have beeeeeen looking for you on you tube.
Beautiful 🦋
What is the name of the song he played on the piano at the beginning?
I honestly think that James should do something similar to RTGame or other streamers where he dedicates a day or two a week to play games live on YouTube (or Twitch) for a few hours, then hire another editor (or get his current ones) to edit down those streams into like 10 minute videos where he then posts it on a secondary channel. That way he has his streams that people can watch in the background if they want to see the whole thing, or just have a short entertaining video for those people who are short on time and want to have a good laugh
I feel like i’m watching an episode of selling sunset
This is really his house
Super in love with your new house!
I srsly wanna live there!!!!!😍😣
I don’t think he understand it’s okay to breathe in between words
No entiendo nada 🥺
Stop making me look so poor

😒😲😤😬😡😠👺👹👿😈👣
I love the style of your home decor!! Totally me 💯
I know you probably went through a lot of criticism and work to get this far and I’m sure it’s something you truly wanted ,but please don’t let that type of life change you. I don’t know you , but I just feel like by watching you and seeing this that I should warn you that being an empath myself that I don’t see it ending very well for you. Just please make sure you don’t let the fame and money control you and you stay true to yourself. (That probably sounds cliché, but that’s the best way I can contribute my advice).
Masha Allah ❤️
Congratulations !!! Sisters !!! ❤️🌈 Your sister here from 🇵🇭💛❤️💙
OMG 🤩😍

The fact that James is only a year older than me and owns a frickin mansion🤯  I'm so happy for him. He deserves this!

Anyone know if this is the same house he did a video on last year decorating it with mr Kate or a new place?
Your house almost looks exactly like Rebecca Zamolo’s new house! That so weird. And also i cant believe it live next to Selena Gomez
I wonder how many places James Charles and his friends always are
His house is brighter than my future
If you wanna know my favorite part of the house:FINN

At fifty, I am still dreaming of owning my first home. I knew it's a bit late, but dreams have no expiration, right? I don't want a giant house, but a nice home where my children and their children can stay with me as long as they wish. I love your home, James.
So was his other house rented? I'm confused
This house is a dreammmm😍😍😍

Woah James has a coke seller 😂😂😂
James heads up larri is gonna Rob you lol
His living room is bigger than my room-
Such a beautiful and comfy space James! We're glad for you :)
Wow que exito Sisters has trabajado fuerte me encantas.
i just saw 3 seconds of this and i just want ur house so bad
I hear a lot of people arguing about the fact that he worked really hard to earn this he did period without the effort he put in to his business and social media he would not be so successful and that is hard work however I will say and don't come off me really not trying to undermine all the hard work he did do but I will say that when it comes to influencers like this there is a certain amount of privilege a part of the reason any of them are that successful has to do with time and place they were lucky to be either living in LA already or had a family or their own money and were willing to move for their career I live in a very small town on and island in Canada there are zero opportunities here for people looking to build their careers through social media and I don't want that kind of life anyways it comes with many sacrifices and hardships I'm just speaking for the people who I know who are extremely talented and can do things at a very professional level example visual artists, makup artists, and even though they are just as good if not better than some of the people who are very well known for those things they will never live somwhere that has opportunities for them and they do not have the family or the money to move to LA considering most of the middle class who live here are still usually struggling which is also fucking ridiculous but a different conversation and obviously that affects people everywhere anyway just wanted to explain why some people think or say he has done no hard work when obviously he has but yes coming from the experience of somone who even if they wanted to walk the walk wouldn't really have that option I do understand the frustration of always hearing people say they worked from nothing because that is not true everyone has a start and where you live and how much money you had growing up can make way more of a difference than a lot of people are willing to admit
James' house is sweet as he is.
Thats my dream home sell it for me for 20$ Lol please😂💔 jk jk but it is my dream house but keep it to urself have a wonderfull day🖤⚡ and congrats for that wondorfull house
I am so proud of you. I feel like James is my son. Is it weird that I have maternal feelings for him?

Like here if you like the house 👇👇
im too broke to watch this
Nombre: Micaela Agustina Merbilhaa  Edad: 23 años recién cumplidos😇 Locación: Madrid, España Hola James primero que nada me encanto tu casa como todo lo que haces, lo haces con amor y esfuerzo🥰💜 Soy Argentina, me mudé a Madrid hace 4 años con mi familia en busca de nuevas oportunidades y una mejor vida. La verdad costó mucho el cambio pero valió totalmente la pena, en fin, con el dinero yo lo que haría sería comprarme una casa, es el sueño de mi vida🏡🧡 sobretodo en España ya que los alquiler son carisimos y uno que recién empieza cuesta un poco más, pero gracias a Dios a pesar de los obstáculos siempre estamos de pie. Que sigas tan bello y resplandeciente como siempre💫😘
when he said “for when me and my friends would do mukbangs” or something like that i got a sister squad flashback
Kalo ujan bantalnya dimasukin ga a?
I don’t really watch James and only had an inkling of what happened so I am so happy to to see him thriving and happy. And congrats: really liked the house. Simple lines and wide spaces and lots of lights.
If you tell me that youtube money bought this house the world is doomed.
James outfit matching his house 😍
love the kitchen
Who thinks he's very organized person 😉😉😉
Very stylish decor! I don’t know if I would like my employees to actually live with me though lol
Where's the stripper pole at?
Every room is bigger than my entire house

You’ve come so far🥺💗 and I am here for the little tree in your room😩
BEAUTIFUL 🥰
Dang, this is amazing if I could afford this house..I WOULD BUY IT! I wish I could. :<.   Btw: Congrats James!
It is just amazing that James is literally so successful and was able to get this house. He started his own business years ago and all dream are coming true I'm so proud and inspired, love you James!<3
I love this entire dreamy house 🥰🥰🥰 Specially Patio and Kitchen. ❤️
Nice but to stale.
Everyone thinks that James Charles fans are ALL from Iceland, like this if you're not from Iceland
Insanely good taste!
Is the same floor plan as jenna marble's house??
i-  yeah that’s all i have to say. just i-
The Coca-Cola bottles have “Medio litro” like here in Latinoamérica 😂
Your master bathroom is beautiful ♥️
You have a very beautiful home James!
dear lord I'm so proud of him!! He is such an inspiration. A lot of people think YouTube and makeup is so easy but this man works the hardest I've ever seen in my life. He is extremely talented but also puts his entire heart into everything he does for us! Sooooo happy and proud you are living your dream James!! <3
Ohhh it’s really cool 😎

Is that Khloe's oreo jar I spy in the kitchen??
Congrats love! I bought my house 2 months after my 25th birthday, there's no better feeling than having ure own little spot in the world.
I wish I had a trampoline like his  I also wish i had a house like his and I also wish i had puppy's like his 🥺🐶😁like if you think Finn and Theodore are adorable ( in this video I don't think Theodore was there because this is two weeks later ) .
His house is a big version of my dream home. Spectacularly furnished, well done. Who does he live with by the way? He keeps saying 'we'
Please do a video using Maddie Zieglers morphie collab just like you did when Charli and Dixie came out with a morphie collab and maybe make it a new series on your channel
Its litteraly the same house what the heck
Nicely done, James! Loving the color scheme! Kudos to your team!
James could be a real estate agent fr
wow...
He must’ve like filmed this before his first time getting drunk video
Wow! You have been bought a beautiful house and it is pleasing to the eye of the beholder. James Charles is a youtube iconic, instant influencer of the viewers and he is my idol. He deserved to purchase his own house at his very young age. I wish somehow or someday I do the same with my idol for my old mother. I love you James Charles, I am one of your fans from Philippines.
The patio 😭❤️
His shower is literally the size of my bedroom🥺😂
I love how Finn is in every room shown... He is clearly following James around ❤️❤️
It's literally looks like those fancy sims dreamhouses. So beautiful 🥰
Ace family vibes 🥰🥰
i anna have this homeeeeee
We need more loveee the house jamesss 💜💜💜😍😍😍💕💕
Loveeeee the house 🥺💜💜💜
i lowkey didnt expect his room to be so simple
I love your video ❤️❤️❤️
I wanna play hide and seek in here
Algún día diré “Hi sister" con James Charles, algún día. :‘)
I’M SO IN LOVE WITH THAT HOUSE
You should do a video with Megan Thee Stallion
Ok that's great success but I still hate you a lot
James could you please link all the music that you used?? I loved the background music for the transitions. Thank you :)
FINALLY a youtuber house that not all white! yayyy!  also-YOUR HOUSE IS SO AESTHETICALLY PLEASING! LOVE THE DECOR AND STYLING OF IT!
Whenever I see clothes like that I'm like they look kind of funny, but when James puts it on I'm like 😍😍😍
Can you post a 2020 morning routine?
When You realise he only just turned old enough to legally drink in the US :o
People say James only has American fans  like if you’re not American
I think you deservers the best
He said Xbox instead of Playstation, I like him
you should call it the “Sister Soda Cellar”
I have to say that the doggo was my favorite part of this video.
He called me poor in 3 different languages 💀
20 years old and owns a mansion. I'm super proud of you James. You definitely deserve it unlike other spoiled kids out there. Keep it up the fantastic work!
loved the 10 adds i had to watch in both of these vids
james charles getting absolutely destroyed by technoblade in minecraft monday—
I think your bathroom is bigger than my room 😂❤️😭 but im so proud of you James ❤️
Lov it
Is it just me or do u guys notice a image in the marble above the fireplace...
Do you live near Rebecca Camilo because your house looks quite similar to hers
this house is pure perfection. As a coca cola adict I got a kick out of the coke celler :)
1:57 that frame reminds me of wings album 😂
please bring back games with james🥺
👍
I’m so excited like it’s my own house !!!
Feel slightly humbled right now
Imagine doing General cleaning on James' house. I cant even 😂😂
Wow, this house is stunning.
Wow, I'm your biggest fan. I always watching your videos.
THE LAST TIME I TOOK A COCACOLA, IT WAS TO UNLOCK THE SINK IN MY KITCHEN! YEAH NICE HOUSE.... BUT (FOR ME) MATERIAL THINGS HAVE NO PRIORITY IN LIFE .. IF WE LEARNED TO BE MORE CONSCIOUS PEOPLE AND LESS CONSUMER AND LESS MATERIALISTS THIS WORLD SURELY WOULD BE DIFFERENT. I JUST APPRECIATE THIS YOUNG'S ART BUT THAT'S ALL.
Your master beedroom and bathroom are so similar to Stephanie Soo's (the layout). LOVING your house, James! It's beautiful, congrats :)))
6:56  Finn: hiya sisters
james ur bathroom is bigger than my bedroom
Ur like so lucky I have been waiting for years to learn piano but a paino is expensive so I can't learn it cuz my parents do not allow me

CONGRATS JAMES!🦋🦋
You should literally be a real estate agent 😊😊
His house is absolutely beautiful
James amo tu casa, espero que la disfrutes
It blows my mind that we are the same age. I need to step up my GAME sisters
I caught my brain on being confused by the absence of breasts :P
Hola tu casa es muy bonita
This is an absolutely dream house!  So happy and proud of you Sister James...❤️ Loads of love and best wishes to you for the new house. May this house bring you all the happiness and peace in your live. God bless you...take care 🤗😘
I am happi for him, he deserves it <3
I assume because I watch a lot of stuffs like "Architecture's digest", it's why this video was recommended to me but like...Wow. I mean, as literally everyone on YouTube I knew who James Charles is (unfortunately mainly because of drama, although from my understanding he was the victim who managed to pull through like a champ :)), his content is just not my thing. This though ? Was great. That house is amazing, so well designed and thought out. It's truly amazing what James managed to build, even through the hardship, and it just made me oddly happy to see him that excited (I literally never saw one video of him, just beauty stuffs aren't my cup of tea, but I just feel happy he achieved a dream haha). Great stuffs.
Play Among Us with Pewds 😭💖
Ozm house
And to think he is this successful at 21
THIS IS MY DREAM HOUSE! very aesthetics
Very nice 👍🏽
James is so wholesome *coke seller* 😂
this is the first video ive finished from james, and i didnt know he was such a gamer
One question... when do I move in 👀

His home looks better than my future 😅
When he starting playing *THAT* song on the piano I LOST MY MINDDDDDDD😭😭😭
Thats a normal house
Hi
Beautiful home!!!!!! I don't even have money to put down payment but James is a billionaire
I *literally* just came ...from the recent video as we gotta know about he being selena's neighbour!!
Congrats on achieving a goal 👏🏼 Personally I’m a 👎🏼👎🏼 on the greige, glossy spread houses. I like colors and signs of life.
Is it just me, or, does this remind u of Rebecca Zamolo’s house?? This is how many ppl think the same 👇🏼
Ffsz0007 snap

Jade Walker, 19, @feeling.jaded Hi, my name is Jade Walker and I am manifesting right now so, when I win this $20,000 give away, I will use it to secure a place to live and pay for my next semester of college. I am 19 years old and a Junior in college, majoring in fashion merchandising. With my degree I am going to start my own fashion company that aligns with all my intersectional feminist ideologies and help establish generational wealth for my family. This money would mean I would have the ability to focus solely on the things that I have a passion for: activism, fahsion, and education, so I can start making my business plans for the future and figure out exactly how I am going to make my dreams a reality. My IG is @feeling.jaded
Kids are starving in America during a pandemic= every rich youtuber shows their houses and cars....
The fact that you created spaces for other people in YOUR house speaks so much about you James! Congratulation on your first home purhcase! You deserve it more than anyone. Can't wait to see whats next for you!
Can I live with you ?!

Looks like the house of a 50yo

Im obssessed with the chandeliers😍😍 adopt me please
your house is literally my dream house

I want his house. The color palette is my favorite.
This is a really nice house! Great job with house decor! Understated elegant! 🎉💕
Name: Arwyn Perry Age: 10 Location: United States( California) Why: I will donate to animal shelters.
Hiiii James Charles! l'm Patricia, and l from Brazil, and I greatly admire your work! Success!!
It’s the Mexican coke for me 🤪
Beautiful home 😍
why not pick multiple winners, like 5k for 20 people or 10k for 10 people. idk.
i love that fact that he's only 20 and has already accomplished so much and he has his own house. He's a whole motivation to me like idk why people hate him he's just so nice and funny at the same time. Love you James ♥️
I would describe Jame's style as 'archetypically  basic'.
Wow i love your house simplicity is the key
Love the mom jeans though.
Welcome to the coke cellar
gaming James is best James
James I'm mad you aren't calling the wine cellar the "sister soda cellar"
i love your house
This house called me ✨poor✨
EXUSE ME HE SAID "FUTURE" FASHION GURU SIR YOU AREEE A FASHION GURUU YASS
I'm crazy jealous of you
Jeffrey star watching be like 👁👄👁
Omg I’m so proud of you I remember when you uploaded your first video!!! Well done ! I’m so proud of you and how far you’ve come since then Omg you gotta do my makeup lol !
This is my dream home😭😭😭
He didn’t show me the basement or outside ugh what a cliffhanger 😩
Pinterest is jealous
I seriously want a James Charles Sister Sleepover!!! 😍♥️
Literally so happy for James, one of the few youtubers that I truly feel is a real, genuine person and I am always excited to see him succeed 🖤
YouTube is getting really comfortable with these double non skipable ads
his house is so big he had to make a part 2😹
That master bedroom patio is a literal DREAM!!!
his bathroom is literally the size of my room 😭😂😂😂
Ian needs to see this and do a sister and brother episode here
This blows my mind. That house is absolutely stunning. It’s  looks something like one of those luxury houses in magazines just million times better.
with that incredible amount of money i’d probably end up using it to help my mom with bills & then be able to use the rest to splurge on my hobby of pen palling & makeup 🥴
It’s beautiful James. Congratulations x
Why are you Gae
wow ♡
I. Was dying when James Charles his cell said hi sisters in the comments
bring back games with james
Good
So this isn’t the same house mr.kate did?
Hola charles soy de ECUADOR y veo tus videos deberías hacer mas videos en ESPAÑOL
Hi sister I love you so much  From me and my best friend she has a crush on.     You
One question, do you need that big house? Really for a person that area, how bad
ILOVE you james
From the Netherlands! 🌹💖💖💖💖
Also James it is really impressive how you worked really hard and you proved that there's nothing is impossible or there is nothing that you can't do. And if you want something really badly you have to go for it, without stoping, with passion! with a pure and fearless heart and hard work you can reach any kind of high you want. You just have to go for it. Thank you for showing it. If i want something i want to believe in me. And no matter what i will get there with my music. Just so you know you are a big inspiration) Thank you!
9:40 😂 I am deceased 😂
Me
Looks like a swedish house
James Charles' room is like the parents room
am i dreaming or did he say 100k dollars
Congrats !!! I am honestly so happy for you 💜💕
So glad you are making your dreams come true. Congrats!!
his master washroom is bigger than my room+my washroom + my 2nd common area
His bathroom is bigger then half of my house
"Roses are red" "Violets are blue "As long as james upload" "He gets a view"
🏘🏡🏠
15.43 I have a question about padios like these - what happens when it rains? All of this gorgeous space would get soaked wet :o
I like the fact that you are actually doing a house tour and not flexing like other people!!
James is so good to see you so excited and happy. Enjoy your new house you deserve it!!!
In our like superstition ur bed is not supposed to face the door its like a bad luck i guess??
When I first saw you I thought you were a girl
Soy la única que habla Español?
I like it that James has Patrick Star's sos wipes! Amazing! I love Patric Starrrr too!!!😘

It looks like the estedic of Rebecca zamolo's house
Omg! Congrats James Charles

Perfect House  ♥️
Me: skipping to the end just to know what the give away is
Is ur bank account okay?
ofcourse he plays on xbox
the cliffhanger was so dope
Wow it is amazing how he could achieve such lavish things he is an inspiration and a pure example of hard work pays of.
I wish i could have my own home one day, i don't mind if it's a wood tiny-house.. however, im working on that...  Nice house, James. You deserved it.
Omg im a girl and u look prettier than me life is mean ;_;
wow honestly james is so impressive. the fact that he's only 21 and built his own business from ground-up and bought this house and he's still so sweet, humble and kind.
Not too bad for a first home...wow slay
This was filmed a week ago and he already has 1 million more subscribers som SLAY SISTER SLAY
I am new  to his channel  and I just love it and congratulations  to  21 million subscribers!!!!!!!♡♡♡
everything is his favorite part of the house
I'm so happy for him but it makes me nervous when people do house tours, showing their floor plan and stuff cause what if someone wanted to rob you? They know what you have in each room
Do give us a tour of your wardrobes!!!
All interior designer freaks like me are drooling.. ik sweetie 😂
❤❤
I've never been a viewer of James Charles (nothing against him, I'm just not a make-up content fan) but I love interior design so house tours/makeovers/etc get me. But, honestly, I'm so proud of James! We all know other YouTubers tried to knock him down in 2019, but he proved how a) he is innocent, and b) he is unstoppable. He seems so down-to-Earth knowing how privileged he is, which I fully respect. I wish him all the best in his future, and his house is beautiful!
the house is so pretty 😻
Beautiful home!!!
your house is beautiful !!!!!
WHATTTT your amazing!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Stunning layout, happy for you!!
Hi Len Broomer  😍
I admire your strength! Keep doing what you do.. Takes a really loving and strong person to overcome what you have in the past year and smile as big as you do! We love it! Congrats on the 20 million and the new home.. All that you have been through you deserve it!
wow i'm actually pleasantly surprised with his house style... way to go man
4:54 - Just marking my time because i’m making his house in roblox bloxburg hehe!
wait does he get a new house every year!?
This house looks familiar that Mr.Kate designed for him
I can’t even afford a fruit basket
Killin’ it, James! Keep doing you!! 💛
Woah james! success at 21! Right off the bat! the key of good YouTube management! You work so hard into editing and posting, thank you <3 💖💖
this is what he deserves to get. he’s so good at his job.
Love your house❤️ it’s amazing, my dream one day😍🙌🏽
Lol. Coke cellar. Oh, James.
It’s not a house it’s a villa
*I like that James Isn't Being So polish Nowadays,,his personality is a lot more fun to watch*
So glad to see you like this ! We can all grow and move on sis ! Love you
How the hell have I never heard of you before? 21 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS??? Amazing but no wonder! You’re adorable and talented💕

The floor plan looks similar to Remi's..only bigger. House looks so classy and comfortable
21 million subscribers!! Damn!!!

Most of the house is the same as Rebecca zamolo
Love the Coke area. I would have placed diet cokes everywhere. Hehehehe

Hi sisterssssssss
I wonder if him, Jenna and safiya all live in the same neighborhood because their houses are so similar in layout. Maybe designed by the same architect or but by the same builder?
I wish it was so organized and clean in my house 🤯
He was 20 million before the video incident.
Are u boy r girl
but who remembers james his appartment tour with the foundation not matching?🥺
It’s beautiful but i wouldn’t want to live in there😩 i feel like i would be stressed bc everything so neat and clean lol

James Charles the gamer 😆
ngl u look so gorgeous, i'm jealous:(
Ok first of all: James said he didn’t want ppl at his house *its his environment he is comfortable in* Second of all: if you were him how would you feel if he broke in ur house and kept ringing at the door bell  Lastly: he can call the cops and his dogs are well trained to attack so beware
Omg pinterest boards are quaking
Damn James, your house is gorgeous! Gives me real dream house vibes! Just everything about it is perfect, so spacious, all that natural lighting! Love the interior design as well, it just gives me peaceful, serene, happy vibes! Love everything! Hope you enjoy your home! x
James: just finishes renovating a mansion  Also James: still has enough money to give away $100,000
Hi James, i've been watching you for about a year now and my best friend keria she started watching you a few months ago and she loves you very much, and it would be my dream if you replyed, plus you've gotten me through alot just saying thank you.♥️✨✨also you dogs are adorable ♥️
Full fish mawmah
I'm so happy for you boo
Literally perfect. A PERFECT HOUSE. Wow
Very beautiful home.
You probably won't see this but I have only just started watching your amazing channel and I would love how to do makeup but don't have any products to learn how to do makeup. You are an amazing inspiration. Thank you for being yourself and ignoring hate. <3
Your house is literally my Pinterest board. So happy for you!
Name: Cydni G. Age: 16 Location: California Why: My mom is working three jobs and we’re trying to move because she wants us to live more comfortably. It’s really hard seeing her getting up and going to job after job after job with the smallest amount of sleep. So, the money would help a lot. 💙
the house is very aesthetic i would so live there
Jamesss, are you living alone???... i hope oneday I have the house also
games with james needs to happen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow, gorgeous. I love everything about it.
I want Games with James to come back!

James. So. Much. Good. Content.  I can’t keep up! 😩
This is so incredible James. You've literally made it to the top. If I were lucky enough to be one of the 5 winners I would use the money to finish helping my children build their channel , and buy a property of our own to live in as me and my two children are living with family due to california prices being so crazy. I'd love to give them their own space and start our own life as a new family of 3.  I'd also start my channel back up and be able to put our quality content. It would be my dream to stay home with my babies and do what we love in making content for people .  Your amazing james, one of the first youtubers I've ever watched and still one of my favorites to this day.  Much love from the Taylor gang fam IG: kb.queen  Snap : kbqueenn
Please play sims 4.
I like it, clean lines, I like it.
love your house! very modern and beautifully decorated yet minimalistic, beautiful house in my opinion.
That blazer is the worst choice I've ever seen
I'm crying, this is inspiring @james Charles. A fruit of hard work indeed ❤️
IM SO PROUD OF YOU JAMES YOUR HOUSE IS BEAUTIFUL SISTER
Any Mexican will be so happy to go to that house for the bottled coca colas
Lmao my closet is half the height and width of one of James shoe racks😂😂😂😂🤣
Too many junks display that is only a show off, and clattered.
Damn i didn't know he was THIS successful
15:11 James! Put some tissue or something in that Birkin, it's slouching!
I’m hesitant to watch youtuber house tours bc I know I’ll feel poor
WOWWW OMGG I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS OMGG!!!!! James u must be rich  🦋✨😊

James soon its my first time moving near Christmas but I am scared 🥺🥺😭
Taeeun Gu 22 New York, NY With the money, I would use it to pay off my loans for college while also using it to pay for my grad school. I really really want to go grad school. It would be sososososo helpful . I grew up without financial help from my parents as I always did everything alone. As the oldest, it’s burdensome to ask the hard working parents so this opportunity would give me the boost. I also want to do investing along with saving money for the future!!  Insta: its_taeeun Snap: onyeol1126 Twitter: taeeun_97 Tiktok: its_grace97
I love your house, James!! You did a great job 😍❤️
Omg I am so late to see this vid but this is so beautiful 😍 me and James have the same style I LOVE him

*Hi sisters.*
So beautiful!!!
Name: Leonor Amaya Age: 26 years old Location: Arizona Reason: Hi James! If I won the $20,000, I would use the money to pay off my student loans. I am independent, living on my own, working full time, and going to school. I would be extremely grateful with any extra money. I also support my mother that lives in Mexico, we are both big fans! Congratulations on 20 mil subs! That's amazing, you are a true inspiration.
James’ bathroom is bigger then my whole room-
This is literally what kimkardashian would live like bruh- sis that house is big
why is his bathroom 10x bigger than my actual room😖
Omg hi sister
Why didn’t you work with Lone Fox?
He plays piano just as fast as he talks 💕💕
HIS KITCHEN LOOKS LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THAT ONE DESIGN HOME ADD
I love the house, it is really near perfect in my view but I wish all that white was broken up with one room or space being in color.
lets get another episode of cooking with Ms.James
This is house is stunninggggg 😍😍
Holidae Ware 18 Shinnston, WV (United States) Insta: holidaeware  Snap: hsrware Tiktok: holidaesummerrayne  Twitter: summerrayneware  Why do I need/What would I do with the money?: Well, I am currently staying at my best friends house because I don’t have any stable family members & I just started my freshman year of college, which I’m paying for by myself. So the first thing I would do is by a car, nothing too expensive (i’ve been saving up my money forever) so I can stop burdening this family with my transportation to school & work. The second thing I would do is pay off the remainder of my college tuition for this year & start renting out my own apartment. I would then save the rest and continue to work so I can proceed to pay my monthly bills and everyday life necessities which I am currently struggling to pay for. My hopes are to save enough money to pay for dental school so I can finally build myself and those I love, the life we’ve never had.  P.S. I just want to say that I understand so many people could really use this money & I’m just glad that people like you are giving back to people like us. I also know that the chances of me ever winning something like this is almost impossible but having something to hope for and have faith in is the only reasoning i’m still here today. Thank you James💛

Laura Ochoa  20 Concord California, United States  IG @lauraochoa101 Twitter @lalalaura_8a  What I would use the money for is for a down payment on a condo actually. For me and my mom and my sister. It is literally our dream to finally have a place to call home that’s just ours. Since we’re always moving and living with family. You have no idea how happy you’d make us.  Thanks Sister!!!

I love the house, don’t mean to hate, but if he has all that money, shouldn’t he be drinking out of reusable cups instead of plastic water bottles from his mini fridge? It’s so wasteful and bad for the environment

Hello, my name is Yasmely and im 24 years old! I dont use instagram but i just love watching youtube videos!! Im from Lawrence Massachusetts!

It will mean the world to me to win! , i want to teach 1st and 2nd grade, it has always been my dream to be an advocate for the children in my city. Lawrence is a very low income community and alot of children and their families suffer because of it. I want to make sure that my students always have someone they can turn to in their time of need! I just want make impact on their life as well as i know they will make a impact on my life too. Thank you for being so generous with your youtube community and im beyond grateful❤️ MY snapchat is Yasmely
God bless you James Charles.Watching from PH.🇵🇭💕

Arlet Castro  19  Seattle, Washington Insta: Arlet.castro  Snapchat: arlo_castro Twitter: arletcastro_ If I were to win I would buy myself a car and save the rest to get a nice place. I currently don’t have a car and I have to walk to work and walk home. It’s really hard because I get really tired but I’m so blessed to have a job I love! I’ve been trying to save up for a car but it’s so hard with all the bills that have to be payed and it would be amazing to be able to buy myself a car, finally! I would be able to visit my mom as often as I wish I could as well as help her and my siblings get around. The car wouldn’t only help me but my family as well. I would also love to have my own little apartment to call my own that would be a dream come true. Maybe even get my teeth fixed because that’s one of my biggest insecurities. I would love to be able to smile in pictures knowing my teeth look amazing! I would honestly be more than blessed if I won because I really would appreciate it, I think it would be an amazing help. Thank you so much for giving us all this opportunity 💘
Seriously dream house! Omg I love all the decor.  Please adopt me lol

Emma Pollard 22 Shropshire, United Kindgom Honestly I don’t have a soppy story, to win this would just be so life changing, I would invest most of it, enjoy some of it and spend some on my YouTube so eventually I’ll be as good as James one day!

hiiiiiiiiiiii i love you james charles you are my idol
Always so proud 🥰
YOU ARE TRULY BLESSED AND AWESOME.....THIS IS ONE BEAUTIFUL HOME AND MORE.
What happend to the piano the twins got you
Hiiii babe! First off, the fact you’re giving away this amount of money is unreal. You’re an angel on this Earth. Second, I’m just popping in to tell you why I want to win this giveaway. I’m 20 and live in Miami, FL. Growing up, life was tough for the most part. my family was ALWAYS tight on money. With that being said, if I won I’d help my mom out. Maybe pay off her debt, idk where I’d start really. She’s 43 and has raised all 5 of us on her own with no help. I saw her struggle everyday but I never saw her give up. She truly deserves the world. This would be a dream + more 😭😭😭😭  twitter handle @kaymbp  tiktok @ kayelahmb  Snapchat @ kayelahb8 Insta @0kaymb
I love ❤️ love 💕 love 💗 the kitchen and the formal living room
the house is beautiful
name: jaylnn age:21 insta:imactuallyjaylnn  i could use the money to help me and my mom move out bc currently we are living with a friend  it would rlly help we are struggling i could use the money for a down payment on a house
No hate but shoulder pads ain’t it
How much did everything all together cost !!!!???
Tell me why this looks EXACTLY like my bloxburg house-
Name daisy  Age 17  Where Quincy Wa  Reason : I want to help my mom with her bills and we live in a trailer that has holes for the past 17 years and it would be nice that I can buy her a house and she can be homeowner and I want to buy her a car because she has that car since I was born and she deserves a car .
Your house is absolutely gorgeous btw ❤️🥺

The money will be just a big help because i just started my bachelors degree on education and school is very expensive and the money will help tremendously with paying school off. It will mean the world to me to win! , i want to teach 1st and 2nd grade, it has always been my dream to be an advocate for the children in my city. Lawrence is a very low income community and alot of children and their families suffer because of it. I want to make sure that my students always have someone they can turn to in their time of need! I just want make impact on their life as well as i know they will make a impact on my life too. Thank you for being so generous with your youtube community and im beyond grateful❤️

Your home is so beautiful! You are an inspiration!! 💓🏠
Christen Hutcheson; 23 Instagram: christenhutcheson96  Snapchat: iichristenii Location: Maryland USA I'm adopted and I just recently found my birth family and it breaks my heart to know they gave me away because they grew up in poverty and not much has changed. My birth mother has had a total of 6 children and gave the oldest three away... I have 3 younger siblings that they have kept. I would use this to pay off their debts and help my brother pay for school, he just started two weeks ago at college and it would mean everything to me to help him live his dreams.  Thank you <3

Hi James, my name is Morgan i’m 23 and i live in St. Louis, MO. I am currently hoping to go back to school to become a nurse but ALSO hoping to purchase my first home soon! 🤗 Though, this can be challenging having to support my family at the same time. Having even a small portion of your generous giveaway could help me reach my goals and dreams. 💕 You are amazing and i love watching your videos and seeing how much work you put into them!

Also, donating some of the money to the blm movement, saving the children, and the stop the trafficking.   Hopefully I’m not too late but thank you for thinking about your fans and helping not only me but literally 21.6 million other people, congratulations. ❤️
Deithrea K. 31 MAUI,HAWAII IG: deithrea_k Hi James, I love all your content! Such a positive influencer! Such a VIBE! What I would do with the money is just trying to make ends meet whole raising 3 Beautiful children!! I am currently out of work due to Hawaii having such a strict COVID19 laws. I work for a hotel and have been furloughed since March. Due to being furloughed I was unable to close on my first home purchase. Which lead to alot of depression and anxiety. Watching your videos have defi7helped me keep pushing and striving to keep going for my kids. I have currently been looking for jobs but it's been a challenge with the kids doing distant learning unable to find a babysitter that will be able to do distant learning with them as well. Just a struggle out here. Thank you for the positive VIBES!!

Hi. I want to work as cleaner in your house. Seriously :-* 💪
The speed James speaks is on another level.
My name is Brittany I’m 23 years old I’m a student and I am living in Florida. If I were to win $20,000 I would be able to move into an apartment. My lease is up soon and since being furloughed from work I went through the little savings I had. I’ll be living in my car again once my lease is up. I have a 2004 Nissan missing a side mirror with a very cracked windshield. I’m a former foster kid so I don’t have much family support. Living in your car in Florida is not fun at all in the horrible Florida heat. Last September to this past February I lived in my car. It was a horrible time for me and I really don’t want to go through that again :/ so I would spend the money on a place to live or to upgrade my car to something better to live in.

Hey James! My name is Mallory, I live in Illinois.. I’m 19 years old and last year I got into a really bad car accident with my cousin.. I accidentally ran thru a stop sign and got hit by a John Deere field sprayer. Luckily we are both doing okay but I ended up losing my license for awhile and totaling my car. If I won the $20,000 I would buy a new car and help pay some of my cousins medical bills and it would also be such a huge help to my online boutique I’m hoping to start in the next few months. Love you the absolute most 🤍 Insta: mallorypflum7 Twitter: mallorypflum Snap: mal.pal7  Tiktok: mal.pal7 Congrats on 20 million!!! You deserve it

games with james comeback please
Hiiii babe! First off, the fact you’re giving away this amount of money is unreal. You’re an angel on this Earth. Second, I’m just popping in to tell you why I want to win this giveaway. I’m 20 and live in Miami, FL. Growing up, life was tough for the most part. my family was ALWAYS tight on money. With that being said, if I won I’d help my mom out. Maybe pay off her debt, idk where I’d start really. She’s 43 and has raised all 5 of us on her own with no help. I saw her struggle everyday but I never saw her give up. She truly deserves the world. This would be a dream + more 😭😭😭😭  twitter handle @kaymbp  tiktok @ kayelahmb  Snapchat @ kayelahb8  Insta @0kaymb
This is the most beautiful house I have ever seen. I want to build this house on sims 😹
Jame your home is similar to Rebecca zamolos house
i have the same bread box as james so we’re basically the same persoj

My name is Myranda Miranda yes you read that right haha married my bff from high school and his last name is Miranda!!! I am 21 years old and I am from California. I would love 20,000 because I recently left my job and we have been struggling, I started training to be a licensed insurance agent so rn winning some money would help greatly. What ever is left after I help pay bills or get things we absolutely need will go towards my medical bills I’m currently $8,000 in debt from just medical bills. We are both getting started in our careers and schooling the money would help us get rid of existing debt and help with my husbands schooling. We want to get a house in Arizona but we can’t do any of that until we are debt free. You’re help would be greatly appreciated Have a lovely day sister James!!!

Hey James! My name is Rachel Lott. I’m 27 years old. Me and my husband have been through a lot the past 2 years. We lost our baby last year so we have a bunch of medical bills. I would use the $20,000 to go toward paying off debt and giving us a little more peace of mind. Nothing can bring our daughter back but it does help to not have to worry about the bills. My insta is xrayrachel.   Rest In Peace Denver ❤️
Is it sad that his bathroom is leittarly the size of my house
James! What an amazing accomplishment! You should definitely be proud. Look at how far you have come. Can’t wait to see the rest on Friday!

It's so prettyy. I'm so excited because David Dobrik also bought a new house! More house tour!
Name: Meghan DeLapp Age:19  Location: Winston Salem, North Carolina Reason: I grew up in a small house with a small family in a pretty small town. A couple of years ago, I made a decision to save my earnings and travel to Uganda to pursue mission work with children from the country. I fell in love with the culture and more importantly, I fell in love with the people. I always thought that growing up, I didn’t really have a lot, much less anything to offer the world to make a difference, but when traveling, I learned just how well off we really are. I would use the a good portion of the money to travel around the world, as well as around our very own country to pursue missions, really just focusing on working with people in need. I specifically would like to travel to places of both past and more recent devastation to volunteer as much if my time and energy to helping those in need. Thanks so much for the opportunity James ❤️ Instagram: Meghan_DeLapp Facebook: Meghan DeLapp
I'm so proud of you
Amazing
I received a transfer of $45,000 directly to my bank account all thanks to expeditetools,com .

Wow I absolutely love this home. It has a cozy and warm feeling. Alot of richer homes that I have seen have more of a cold feeling. They don't have a feeling of home, warmth and relaxation.
I literally could not stop smiling during this video! I can't wait to buy my first home! Thank you James for the uplifting content during these hard times. Amazing house, James. You earned it.

Your house is three or four times bigger then my house crazy... but i love it its perfect for you... love your outfit
*llora en pobreza* 😭😭😭  That house looks awesome
Hiiii babe! First off, the fact you’re giving away this amount of money is unreal. You’re an angel on this Earth. Second, I’m just popping in to tell you why I want to win this giveaway. I’m 20 and live in Miami, FL. Growing up, life was tough for the most part. my family was ALWAYS tight on money. With that being said, if I won I’d help my mom out. Maybe pay off her debt, idk where I’d start really. She’s 43 and has raised all 5 of us on her own with no help. I saw her struggle everyday but I never saw her give up. She truly deserves the world. This would be a dream + more 😭😭😭😭  twitter handle @kaymbp insta @0kaymb

Hi sisters✌
It's very nice! Why do y'all walk around with outside shoes on though
I’m in love with this house it’s literally a my dream house! James definitely deserves this!
If I won I would use the money to fix my teeth. They are falling out and i am in constant pain. I am only 22 and never went to the dentist as a kid. I feel like my teeth are a reason behind employers not wanting to hire me. My goal is to be a labor and delivery nurse, although I feel very self conscious when I speak due to the way my teeth look.

Bella Rosenthall 20 Yorktown,Indiana Insta: bella_rosenthall  Twitter: bellarosenthall  I love you James and it’d be so amazing to win this giveaway. My goal in life is to open my own boutique and open a facility where kids with disabilities can go during the day to play/hangout. This would be an outlet for their parents & family to take a break from the craziness of having children with disabilities. My brother has a very rare disease and my family and I know the struggles that come with it. But don’t get me wrong, he is the biggest blessing ever. Shaving this money to create a safe place for these kids would be absolutely ideal. LOVE YOU JAMES!! XOXO

James Charles is giving a giveaway and me and my sis want to get it then we look at the amount of subscribers he had 😂
I love how this video was exactly 17 minutes 😂
I admire James moving on with his life and continuously improving as a person and as a celebrity.
Honestly need a day in the life of James Charles video PRONTO

I tought this was a house tour not a Buckingham Palace house tour   EDIT: you have gained 1 million subs in one week the fuck!!!!! Congrats
Why did I watch part 2 before part 1... awkward
Congrats James
Okay the interior is insanely beautiful. I want to work there so badly lol. The only thing that would make it even better is actual wine in the wine cellar 😝
Guy has taste.
When i was 21 i was still too anxious to make my own dentist appointments...
Nope this is a literal manor. Sickening!!!!
Jame’s bedroom is like a hotel room 😳
i’m gonna do this house in bloxburg 💀
James your house is bigger than my house my house is bit larger
may pag-asa kaya akong manalo sa giveaway? May Pilipino din ba dito? reply ka naman😂

Hello, my name is Yasmely and im 24 years old! I dont use instagram but i just love watching youtube videos!! Im from Lawrence Massachusetts! The money will be just a big help because i just started my bachelors degree on education and school is very expensive and the money will help tremendously with paying school off. It will mean the world to me to win! , i want to teach 1st and 2nd grade, it has always been my dream to be an advocate for the children in my city. Lawrence is a very low income community and alot of children and their families suffer because of it. I want to make sure that my students always have someone they can turn to in their time of need! I just want make impact on their life as well as i know they will make a impact on my life too. Thank you for being so generous with your youtube community and im beyond grateful❤️

My favorite thing about LA people is hearing them talk about how awful the light fixtures were in the home they bought and how the awful ones they put in are so much better 😂 you know the next person in that home is going to do the same exact thing. Some lamp guy in LA really found his niche. Lol
Your house is sooooo pretty! I want to buy my own house someday too 😭
you really came for vogue like okay go off i guess
Legit this is the first celebrity house I really love. Somehow it is glamorous, modest and cosy at the same time.  Love it! ♥️
Im obsessed with this house 🏠 😍
Right, so what form do I apply to - to work with you?☺

Finn is so cute 🥺
this house actually has a feeling. Most of the other house tours celebs make is just a white box with a chair. This has so much character. I love it
I’m just in love with your house omggg

I wanna know what you're wearing!! That crop top needs to be in my closet.
James charls bathroom is bigger than my house🐱
Wow what a beautiful house ❤️❤️❤️
I really find James annoying and I don’t watch him anymore but I like his taste in the design of his home.
You've worked so hard, fought so many battles, went through a mentally dark place, had suicidal thoughts, faced rejection and failure,  to reach here. This achievement of yours should be celebrated. I'm so happy and proud of you sister. I know probably you won't see it but if you do, know that in your life, you'll be facing more problems and when you do, see this video of yours and remember this is your achievement. More power to you. From a sister, about whose existence you don't know of. Love you, take care.
I thought he bought a house a year or two ago
Imagine being in college and saying you live in James Charles house...
GAMES WITH JAMES!!!
That suit jacket is to big for her...
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE ...BUT THIS IS NOT SO IMPORTANT.....WISH YOU NEVER BE ALONE  IN YOUR HOUSE ...HEALTH   LOVE AND HAPPINES ..ALL THE TIME IN YOUR BEAUTIFUL HOUSE !!!sorry for my english .
God😭😭 His house 🏡 is like my dream fantasied house, that I want to live in.
You're an INSPIRATION!
James house looks so much like Rebecca zamolo house 😂
You are gey ( pls dont sed i like you you are good person)
🙄🗣️🗣️🗣️🤪🤯😫😵😲🙅🙅🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️😒
good on him seriously after what happened last year im glad he got it together!
Nothing that folks love more than people who are rich, by being famous for nothing, showing off their wealth while the economy is tanking, people being evicted, becoming homeless, losing their jobs and dying from a lack of healthcare.  YouTube really needs to fix it's algorithm so that I stop getting videos from people living in gross excess. What about me watching BLM protests, news, documentaries and politics makes YouTube say "I bet this person would love it if we showed a James Charles video!"?
So organized!!! 😃 This is my dream house 🏡
james: one day in the future i want to be a fashion guru me: you already are!!
When he opened the door I was sooo wanting him to say “MTV welcome to my crib” ... but then again he’s like 5 years younger than me So maybe he doesn’t remember those days .

MELINDA PEABODY  24  PHILADELPHIA, PA I am a newly graduated nurse as of 2019. I graduated, got a job at UPENN Hospital, and now I am just doing my best to learn, be supportive, and a happy face in my new role during this difficult time. With $20,000 I could pay off my student loans and I could get ahead on rent for my apartment. This year has been tough for new nurses so I commend any and all of the front line workers. ❤️❤️❤️ congrats on 21M you truly deserve it!!!! Social media: melpeabs

Name- Josh holland  Age- 23  Location- Evansville, Indiana.  Instagram- _heyimjoshua_  What I would do with 20,000- pay off mine & my boyfriend debt& our cars. Buy some sisters apparel! My boyfriend and I love the new collection! Also I would donate an amount of the money to the local Tri-State Alliance to make a difference for struggling youth who may not have accepting parents or a safe home. I also would donate some money to those affected by hurricane Laura!! Thanks for this opportunity James!
Enya Guerra 20 Mexico City, Mexico Insta: so_enya I really be so grateful if I won, I would finally be able to go to college and continue studying will allow me to achieve my dream of having my own company. :)
Hi James, my name is Nydja Chiazor @nydja_ on instagram! I am a 21 year old college student from Washington D.C. With 20,000 I would be able to get my clothing brand “Pretty n Prints LLC” off the ground. My business stands for showing the world that girls&gays deserve respect regardless of the clothes (or prints) they wear. If I won I would also use the money to move into my own apartment in Atlanta GA because no 21 year old wants to live with their parents & that is the perfect city for me to begin networking. I’m manifesting sooo hard ❤️🥴. Thank you in advance!
Im subscribe
I love him and wish I come meet him but I'm a Sister fro Canada. But the house is incredible!

Name ; Alyson brooke  Age; 18  Location; Palm Bay , Florida  What would I do with the money ;  I would donate some to charity. And save some and definitely fix my truck it’s been having problems starting at times it will and then it won’t. And the radio is broken , the ac kicks on but kicks off and it’s been difficult trying to deal with it  as you know florida is crazy hot 🥵 and with my truck acting up it’s hard trying to get to work .. I really need the money to fix it and donate to charity and save the remaining for my future for medical program wanting to be a nurse
Hiiii babe! First off, the fact you’re giving away this amount of money is unreal. You’re an angel on this Earth. Second, I’m just popping in to tell you why I want to win this giveaway. I’m 20 and live in Miami, FL. Growing up, life was tough for the most part. my family was ALWAYS tight on money. With that being said, if I won I’d help my mom out.

Omg like that house is so pretty
wow the master bedroom is the size of my house,,,,,, I love the new house I feel like it's minimalistic while still having all of the necessities and all the space is smartly used!
He really said “mookbongs”
Omg this house is every vibe I ever wanted
YES JAMES, WE WANT GAMES WITH JAMES!!!
That house looks like Rebecca zamolo house
Name: Jayde Age: 19 Location: Tennesee Instagram handle: @jaydeolson333 Reason: I am a single mother struggling with her finances and living with my friends parents. I want to be less dependent on my loved ones and put some money towards an apartment as well as my first vehicle. I also want to get a computer so I can complete my ged, and I want to use my leftover money to build a savings for my son. This would honestly be such a life changer for my son and I.
It’s a beautiful house,  just as well you don’t drink wine because that wine cellar has obviously been designed as a showpiece and not a functional cellar.  Wine should be stored in a dark, cool space, not a sun filled cupboard in the middle of the hallway.
Games with James please
I love absolutely loveee your house and I usually don't like celebrities homes but yours is absolutely beautiful yet rustic and homey!

James baby I know I'm 30 but can you adopt me.I was adopted by the wrong people ! 😂 such a beautiful home 😍

First home? You said you bought the last one. So toxic
Name: Marilu Mendoza From: Pāhoa, Hawaii Age: 23 Instagram: @_marilu.m   If I were to win, I would definitely use the money to pay for my dads medical bills and make sure that he won’t have to worry about any charges for his dialysis. I would fix my mom’s smile and make sure she can go into the world fully confident like she deserves. Honestly, taking care of my parents in general is a huge goal for me and this would allow me to do so a little bit💗
Was there two of this video? Or are my likes and comments disappearing
I’m happy for him but it makes me sad that realistically I’ll never be able to afford such things.   I’m 25 btw :/

Melissa Torres  26 Chicago, Illinois  Instagram: mels.salgado Snapchat: melikinns TikTok: mels.salgado Twitter: mels88864151  I would like to win the $20,000 to be able to pay off my student loans! I am currently student teaching and I am so excited to finally start teaching. However, I am not looking forward to paying my student loans! I grew up in a household where my parents could not give me the funding for my schooling. They focused on providing a roof and food for me and my siblings.  Therefore, I had no other choice than to take out loans to pay off my schooling. I know that I want to make a difference in my community and that is why I chose to become a teacher. Making a change starts at school and what we teach our young students!  I really hope I win this to help alíviate stress after graduating this December! James Charles please pick me! You won’t regret it. Love you tons!
That nasty shower comment lol
You house is half the price of my house but you have a bigger house and cooler...
Love the house sister keep up the good work✨
This is lithely the still my mom loves.
hi james love you the most  my name is Amber Garcia I'm from LA but live in washington I am 23 years old  my instagram handle is @theambergray I can't even fathom winning 20,000 dollars but if I did I would pay my car off and I would also get myself out of debt and take my sister on a nice trip because she took me in 5 years ago when I was living in my car and I owe her everything. I would also buy a vlog camera because I want to get into youtube you inspire me everyday and lastly with any remaining money I would donate to the lgbtq and blm organizations and put some in my saving
His last house look the same
Such a Beautiful house, Congratulations sista sista 💗😍🥰
I literally comment everyday with so much hope!

What is with the ring???
Hiiii sister! First off, the fact you’re giving away this amount of money is unreal. You’re an angel on this Earth. Second, I’m just popping in to tell you why I want to win this giveaway. I’m 20 and live in Miami, FL. Growing up, life was tough for the most part. my family was ALWAYS tight on money. With that being said, if I won I’d help my mom out. She’s 43 and has raised all 5 of us on her own with no help. Idk where I’d even start but I’d probably start off with her debt. I saw her struggle everyday but I never saw her give up. She truly deserves the world. This would be a dream + more 😭😭😭😭  twitter handle @kaymbp insta @0kaymb tiktok @kayelahmb 🤎🤞🏼
Karina Pichardo  22 Queens, New York  @simplyyy_rina for all socials  With twenty thousand dollars I would pay off a big chunk of my student loans. Its been a long road and you don't know how much this would help. I get absolutely no help from family. I pay it all on my own and have to pay it off completely all on my own. Thanks for the opportunity James! Much Love <3
I remember watching videos of James showing his apartment, and also his other home. It really strikes me how much something can change in what feels, looking back, like a relatively short time. It's a beautiful home!
You really make my day everyday🥺❤️
Lucera Gante-Espinoza  15  Chesnee sc  And I would put it towards my family this money would help us so much like it could change so much for us
Kaniz Saima IG: @kanizsaima287 Age: 17  With the 20,000, I would try to find a new home for my family and make a down payment for a house. My family and I have been struggling to move for a while now due to various personal problems that arose. Currently, I am the only one working so the moving situation has gotten even Harder. This money would help a bunch with everything. Even if I do not win, thank you for thinking of doing this!
It’s nice but I feel a lack of character. Almost a bit boring
Great tour! Love your home! Dream home for sure! 🏡 🏠 🏡
Anyone else see how white James face is?? Haha
Hiii siiissttteerrrss!!!! (MTV!) My name is the James MF Charles, and welcome to my crib!!!

Angelica Sánchez @_angelicaaadsg 25 years old   Hey James,           You have been such an inspiration to watch and the way I would use the $20,000 would be $5,000 to finally finish production and the final touches to my swimsuit line and the rest of the money I would use it as down payment for my house! Me and my husband have been trying to get a house since our son was born and it’s been extremely difficult specially with a small child to save! That’s money would help out so much.  Thank you so much and your home is gorgeous you deserve it Sister!

Hi my name is Lorena Bailon, I'm 26 years old. I'm a single mom, I been doing it all on my own since my son has been 10 months old... I've had a difficult life growing up living in poverty.. Weather I was staying with family and or friends or living from our car.... It was tough, so I want a better life for my son. I don't want him to grow up like I did... So if I won $20,000, it would help me towards my goal on getting a house for my son & I. So he could live and have a good life to better himself more for the future because as they say the kids now are our future and I want him to be somebody & make something of himself & that starts with a healthy environment. My my Instagram handle is @lorena_bailon
goals honestly
Honestly think you should be sponsored by coke!!
The one thing I hate about using designers, the homes don't look lived in

Name: Courtney Age: 26 Instagram: @xcourtelizabeth Reason: Honestly I would use this to help me get out of debt so I can get back on my feet and start a future with my boyfriend who has been an AMAZING stepdad to a son who he loves as his own and my precious 2 year old son. My BD kinda just took a bad route and isn’t in the picture. I’ve been raising my son and paying for everything for him on my own. i’ve stressed myself out with bills, and I just want to be able to give them my all. Unfortunately right now I can’t give them my everything because my stress is really kicking my ass. this is by no means a sob story just someone who wants to get back on her feet for her son and the man of her dreams. I would appreciate it with everything and be so greatful!
LOVE WATCHING YOU!!!! & Seeing your happiness 😃😃😃😃
I want to see some cooking with James 😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿🥺

Connie Lopez 28 Los Angeles, CA Insta: skincare_by_connielopez / connie__lopez I would use this money to pay off my student loans, so that any money I am saving at the moment could go towards opening up my own business that could help me take care of my mom. After our parents divorce she had to sacrificed so much for my sisters and I to have a good life, go to college, have food on our table. I sometimes wouldn’t eat so that my mom could eat a full meal. I would love to be able to repay her so she wouldn’t have to work so hard anymore.

So, is it just me or does that kitchen and living area almost look identical to Jenna marbles house?

Andy Solano 22 Brooklyn, NY Instagram: @andy.omo With 20k I would be able to really kickstart my clothing brand and styling company. My brand Versatile Enterprise is a small brand that is built on bridging the social divide that is between streetwear and lgbtq+ hookup culture and trans visibility. I think one of the most important things to me is being able to really continue to shine light on POC individuals and artists who are trying to break into such a competitive industry and with this money, I would be able to give work opportunities to these people in a brand that finally sees them and respects that as the beautiful human beings they all are. I have been following you and your channel for as long as I can remember and am continuously inspired and blown away by everything you've done. I too am a gemini and I see the spirit that surrounds you. and I tell my partner all the time that we will definitely be meeting (and possibly working with) you in the future! xx AndyOmo <333
Many people think only GIRLS watch and follow James, like if you arent a GIRL

Hello James, thank you very much! for sharing your progress,! I like to see everything you do, you are an inspirational boy, I wish you all the best in the world, I am Mayra Martínez, 32 years old, I live in New Jersey, USA, my Instagram is @mayramrtnez, if I won the  $ 20,000 dollars I would be happy because I could buy the first house and have more space to record my videos because I live in a very small apartment 😔 it costs me to record and I would buy a professional camara and all the tools I need for my instagram videos and take my videos  at another level I do not have a camera I gravitate with my old cell phone 😭 I hope to win them thanks
Name : Jennifer Jimenez  Age : 18  Location : Las Vegas Nevada  Instagram: jennifer.97191 Why: what would I do if we my family and I won the 20,000 dollars? With 20,000 dollars we would be able to cover everything such as Bill's,  certain things that we have to pay, things that we can get them out of ours ways with these 20,000 dollars. But if there were to be a chance  of me winning this prize, it wouldn't just be for me it would also be for my people such as families and friends, that helped me through our my journey. Many of them helped me when I moslty needed some to count on someone who can help me get through of had situations especially my mother. My mother has always been there for me and I want to be there for her and pay her back everything she has done for me and not just with money wise but with everything else that she gave me once to continue with my journey. In addition this is what I would do with 20,000 dollars.

I plan on becoming a mentor for others and this 20k would help me invest in my YouTube channel which it’s niche will cater all ages but will help many others who were once in the same position as me (before the 20k lol) to start a business of any sort or surrounding starting their own vending machine business or looking to learn to invest in real estate with the revenue from their vending machines. SISTER JAMES I LOVE YOU! Period 🥳💚💚💚
Name: *Ruel Carpio Llemos* IG/Twitter: *@therealestruel* Age: *25* Location: *Urdaneta, Pangasinan, Philippines* WTD: *Will be buying a lot or estate for us to use to build our house since we don't have one since I was born. My fam been staying there for 27 years now which is located amidst of a ricefield where we got our money and living from - with no electricity and a neighborhood. That is all fine. We're eating 3× a day because of the hardwork my parents does.* *Another thing that I'll be using with the price is a ticket for me to be send in school - an amount to pay miscellaneous and tuition fees and an allowance - I might be 25 year old lad but I'd still want to be in a university. My parents can't afford me to be in college due to financial problem and here in the Philippines, local farmers are expected to be poor. They aren't receiving the best treat they deserve. That's sad but we're used to it as long there's food on our plate, we're good.* *Hoping that I'll be one of the winners, Jamie Charlie. Keep safe!*
Mashallah ❤️❤️ Stay safe stay healthy stay strong😘❤️❤️

Ashley Dean 25 Ig: beautybyashleyanne OR queen_leox333  I’d use the money to help my fiancé get out of debt with hospital bills so we can have a amazing wedding! help my growing at home business and it’ll help us get a home for us and our 3 kids ❤️
My bane is Megan and my insta is Mschwarzinger   I am from Chicago, Illinois!   I would use it for my students and car loans as well as rent!! It would be so appreciated!  Thank you sister!!!
Name: jay Age: 23 Location: NC For: I would pay off my Hyundai. infest some of it, put it to stocks, go shopping 😭 and pay some more bills off...wining this would make my 2020 a whole lot better.
Wow that is a lot of money
How nice
Hey sisters!❤️❤️❤️🤣😝
We love you James! Its so refreshing to see you flourish ❤️❤️❤️
Hi sister!!! First of all, I want to say how important and unreal this giveaway is! And also, I want to thank you for always making me smile! My name is Stefania (my friends call me Stefanie) Petridou and now I live in Greece. I am not going to say why I deserve this amount of money- I believe that many of us deserve this relief because of the coronavirus situation and I know that all of us face our own struggles and problems, so I don't think I lave to complain about the inequalities that I have faced many times. I 'm just popping in to tell you what I am going to do with them, which in my opinion is more interesting. I am going to make escape rooms which will be available for everyone at their computers or virtual reality glasses. You and your friends could play it together like you are in the same room. It is an idea that I 've been working on and this money will go for each website and some more expenses for the creation of the 3D rooms. Also, I was always hoping to buy a good camera, because I love making videos and taking pictures-- I will use the camera for the book I am making and I want to release. I hope you liked my ideas and thank you so much for your time!
Sierra  21 Newcastle Pennsylvania  @lil_tt_thomas  I would take 16,000 and pay off school then I would buy a car with the rest to get me to and from school
I can’t add any more submissions):
Omg how much did that cost?
Can you pls do a q&a video?🙏🏽💕
Hi James All your videos are SO good. But I have a question. Are you a man or a woman?🤔 Cause I’m new on your channel Pls answer this!🙏🏽 And last thing I subscribed and liked all your videos❤️💕🌸 You so pretty btw🥺 Nice house😉😊🌸

Beautiful Home, you deserved it sis! ♥
If I’m not as rich as James (or more🥴) in the next year and a half, I will have a sister meltdown 😭😭
I love you James Charles 😍😍😍😍😘😀🏠🏠
Also help my dog because he has leukemia
Name: Angelina Wilson Age: 19 Insta: @some.awesome.angie Location: California, United States Reason: I would put the $20,000 towards getting my best friend a brand new car. He’s had a 2004 Honda Civic for years and it finally broke down. He has been there for me through thick and thin, and I’ve always wanted to give him something really special. To give him enough money to purchase a good quality vehicle he will use for years is the least I can do for everything he’s done for me. My best friend deserves that and so much more
yeeeessss i wanna see games with james
When he said giving away $100,000 my reaction was the same as that emoji lol
watch my room tour too. support me 🥰
OH ME GEEEE
Payton Rutledge  17  Indianapolis, Indiana  If i had $20,000 i know exactly what i would do with it. I inspire to be at the top of the culinary world one day. I want to attend the Culinary Institute of Michigan. With $20,000 i could pay for my schooling. I also want to attend cosmetology beauty school. Im really good at doing makeup and hair. I would love to explore and expand my skills. I know you’re probably thinking “wow two totally complete opposite careers”. I know people always tell that i can never do both or that I won’t make it. But i just ignore and keep going because i know i can do anything want and be who i inspire to be as long as i believe in myself. So, that’s what i would do with $20,00.

Hey James I know am doing this in the comments. I would like to get the 100k. Here is why my parents are working to purchase our own home but money is kind of tight. This 100k will help with bills and also the house. Right now am living in a 2 bedroom house and I have 3 siblings. This would mean a ton to me hopefully I get it.
Alisya Feaman 12 Missouri, USA Insta: @feamanalisya
Sofia 13 Escondido,CA @Sofia.r.76  I would give some to my grandparents for medical reasons and I would buy things that we need and help pay the rent

Name: Ariel Jolly  Age: 23 Location: Brandon, Mississippi  Why? I’ve got some major medical bills to pay off. My youngest son had surgery in February; then, ended up needed a helmet to correct his head shape. Our insurance wouldn’t cover any of it, so it’s put our family a little bit in a bind.  If I won, I would pay off our debt, then proceed to donate the rest of it to the children’s hospital he was a patient at. ❤️
Name: Alexis Skidmore  Age: 20  Location:  outside of Charlotte, NC  Why: I would use it to start paying off my student loans sing I just graduated as well as get my life started. It would be sooo helpful especially since jobs are getting harder to come by!
Felicitaciones @JamesCharles  se q puedes leer esto!! Tu casa es un sueño!!!! Soy singlemom y te conoci por mi hija de 11 Años  q es obsesionada contigo!!

I wanted to start off by saying that i've never tried entering a giveaway because i have never believed that I could ever win such a thing. I'm 18 and I live in Lebanon, i don't know if you've heard about the explosion that happened nearly 1 month ago and I'm not telling you about it to make you pity me. On the contrary I'm trying to explain to you why I would really need to win this. The situation in my country is really bad on all levels. Everybody has been struggling with money and it's been really hard to survive here. Especially my family. We were already running out on money a few months ago and  the destruction of our house (because of the massive explosion) was just the icing on the cake. I thank god that all of us weren't home because we would have been probably dead. I have to go to college soon but I really don't know how I'm going to be able to do that. My parents have been working really hard and have been insisting that they will be able to pay the college bills but i know that they will drown themselves into more and more debt. I really need the money to help my parents, and maybe help replace everything's that been shattered at home. I've been a huge fan since day 1, and have watched you grow from all the drama and feuds that you have gone through. You are an amazing person for willing to help subscribers in need.  And even if I didn't get the chance to win i wanted to thank you for giving this opportunity to millions of people. I love you regardlessly James. And hope that you see this comment. Ps: i don't reside in the US  but I have family members that do.  Instagram : rim_moubayed
Maritza Rodríguez  United States  Insta: marr0d Hello James my name is Maritza and if I won the 25,000 dollars I would definitely use it toward college tuition but also pay of my moms bills and use half of the money for a down payment on a house we’ve been wanting since like forever. My parents deserve nothing but the best and knowing that I am doing this for them would be magical and a dream come true. I can’t think of anything else but to give back to the people who raised me and gave me so much and sacrificed themselves to give my sisters and me nothing but the best.❤️

hey is there any possible solution to the fact that i cant put notifs for him on bc its "kid content"
congrats to you! :)
if i won the giveaway i would finally get proper treatment for my childhood trauma and maybe get some proper cat walks for my cat in my home and also redo a lot of my grandmas house to put railings up and make it safe- im living with her and its so hard to see her struggle at times. My cat is my whole life so id buy him premium food too and also take him to the vet way more for check ups lol. I wouldnt spend it all at once id try to make it practical and useful to give me some boost in life.. i feel pretty frkn lost. I dont have hardly any of those social platforms tho... all i use is youtube 😭
Sister James I am so obsessed with your beautiful home, it's just magical!😍😍💖💖
Harvey  13  Uk I would be a new set up for my streaming career

Name. Sophia Azurin  Age. 10  Location. Fruitland Idaho Why. My family’s struggling with money cause my mom lost her job and she can’t find any jobs
I wish that i lived there
Hi James, I think it’s so cool that you’re giving away SO MUCH MONEY. If I were to win, I have big plans for the $100k. First, I would definitely pay off some of my student loans. I have a whopping $120k waiting for me to pay :’) Additionally, I have been wanting to buy a house for FOREVER. I would also use a portion of it to put a down payment on a house. I am so tired of renting because I don’t feel like I’m able to really make my living space my own. It’s always so bland :P A third thing i would do is expand my makeup collection. Being broke is hard when you want to have the same makeup capabilities as James Charles lol, i currently have one eyeshadow palette with 9 shades and some mascara and eyeliner. Sad, i know. Anyway, this money would help me in so many ways and I really hope you consider me to win. Here’s my insta: @payton_pierce_
I would use the money to pay for my house loan because my family is struggling
Wow
Kimberly Toledo, New York, 19, @kimberlytoledoo   . You’re amazing for this doing btw!!! I would use the money to buy a car bc I really need one to get to my job, and use it for rent because I am living on my own and it’s hard. I don’t have health insurance and I really need to fix my teeth because it’s a constant pain, so this would help a lot. I know whoever wins, deserves this so I trust you and your team on picking. Good luck to all you beautiful sisters. I would be forever grateful if I did win❤️
Name: Trey Brown  Texas  Insta: @706trey 22 I would use the money from the giveaway to get my car fixed. I was recently in a car accident where I hit a deer (thank God I’m alive), but my insurance didn’t pay for it. Also, I’m in the Army active duty, and I’m deploying overseas soon. I would use the money to pay up my bills while I’m gone i.e my student loans prior to joining the service, my car note, & braces.
Most of the fans will be girls anyway awesome video again👍 always stay connected
I think I’m the only one who SCREAMED when he got on the rolling ladder 💀
Michelle flores  Location: CA Instagram: mivhellef Winning this money would give me the chance to not only help find buy a stable home for me and my family but will allow me to give my mom a break who has worked so hard to  provide as a single mom for me and my sister.
wow you house is so nice!
Name: Krysten  Age: 19  Location: Idaho Reason: to help the children have a better program at the homeless (non-profit) shelter that I work at. Every kid deserves to have a good child hood
Hi James! Thank you so much for doing this for your supporters it means so much. I just turned 18 a few weeks ago and will be starting college in a few months. If I won, I’d use a lot of the money towards my college tuition. I would give the rest to my mother because being a single mom it hasn’t been easy but she never fails to provide for me and continuously works hard to survive. I would love to give some money to her to help her out financially because I love her so much. I currently reside in Northern Virginia! My insta is: @kat.haag My twitter is: @_princesskatxo_
Other you tubers use house tours to show off how rich they and it always looks pretentious, but with James he is greatful for how he got to this point and just wants to show what the support he has received has helped him do. I respect that
Yassssssss.Queen.yas.UwU

Hello, my name is Yasmely and im 24 years old! I dont use instagram but i just love watching youtube videos!! Im from Lawrence Massachusetts! The money will be just a big help because i just started my bachelors degree on education and school is very expensive and the money will help tremendously with paying school off. It will mean the world to me to win! , i want to teach 1st and 2nd grade, it has always been my dream to be an advocate for the children in my city. Lawrence is a very low income community and alot of children and their families suffer because of it. I want to make sure that my students always have someone they can turn to in their time of need! I just want make impact on their life as well as i know they will make a impact on my life too. Thank you for being so generous with your youtube community and im beyond grateful❤️
You’re house is so GORGEOUS, it’s literally my dream house. You’ve come a really long way and I’m very proud of what you’ve accomplished so far. I know you’ll do more great things.   If I were to win the $20k, I would help my stepmother build up her fashion business. She’s raising 6 kids right now, so I know it’s a little tough for her to start planning and taking the steps to start it since things financially are tight right now.

🤍✨ My name is Claudia Torres✨🤍 My Instagram: @Clawde.a I’m 19 years old and I currently live in Arizona and I just graduated high school. I was love to use the money for my education onto becoming a dental assistant.... it’s a start I want to help people feel confident and in their own smiles... It would really help me because my student loan doesn’t cover everything and I’ve been working two jobs at Target and Walmart which is stressful. Since I’m also Trying to save up money as well for a car. It’s really hard to save money when I have to lyft and take the bus to work or school because my parents aren’t willing to take me nor help me... so The money would be COMPLETELY HELPFUL and I would be honored and sooo appreciated if I earn this giveaway, but by the way congratulations. So proud of you! And by the way. Instagram and YouTube is the only social media I have. Hopefully I’m not disqualified. I love you and have a beautiful dayyy!!!
Name: Apechha Shah Age: 25 Location: Goldcoast Australia I would use the money to pay my education loan which I have 2 more years to complete from now. I have been working and studying at the same time. It would be a great help for me to complete my studies here in Australia..❤️

I would pursue my dream of becoming a cosmetologist. I would love to be able to do something that I absolutely LOVE and throughly enjoy for a living. Something i started doing to help my friends feel beautiful on a budget. It mean the world to me someone so high up in the beauty industry helping me start me on my dream career.

I commented once but I made a Twitter since it said all platforms to follow.   My name is Courtney Gates  I turn 28 tomorrow.  My Instagram is courtneygates2020 and my Twitter is @courtne02548116  If I was to win $20,000 I would return to school and buy a more reliable vehicle. I have a 5 year old, 10 month old and I’m expecting a baby girl in December on the 7th. My babies are my world and while I support them okay and work for them, I want something more stable work and vehicle wise. I want to eventually return to school to be able to eventually purchase a home and have more security for my babies! Any remaining money would go to my grandmother/momma! My mom has struggled her whole life and I love to help her when I can! 💕
It's genuinely so impressive that a 21 year old bought this house
I need this house but in Texas 😳🥰😍
Ok so when am I moving in James

Alexis starling 18- 19 in September  Indianapolis, Indiana  Instagram @xo_alexisrenee Snapchat @xoalexisrenee00 What and why? I would put the money towards getting my first apartment that’s the goal I’ve been working towards and definitely getting a car because I was offered a full time position and applied for a better paying job and was unable to accept due to unreliable transportation. My boyfriend had an incident in February resulting in 2 surgeries so far they are still not sure if he has to have more. he didn’t have insurance at the time he does now but did not pick up the month of February, he has been making payments on it while still trying to save for us to get our apartment. I would also like to take my personal make up journey a little farther you have been a huge inspiration to me in many ways and I would be forever grateful if chosen for this opportunity!🤍🤍🤍

Hi James Charles! I have been following you for years (way before 20 million)! My name is Kara Mace. I am 32 years old. I live in Vero Beach, FL and I am a nurse. I would use the $20,000 to start my own business. I have always wanted to start an adult day care center to care for elderly patients who can’t take care of themselves 100%. We would have daily activities for the patients and this would give an opportunity for their families to drop them off and allow time to get their errands done and we would provide a safe and fun environment for the patients! I currently do private duty for a gentleman with Alzheimer’s, and I look forward to taking care of more patients like him! My Instagram is @kmaceinyaface. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with your fans! We are so proud of you! Xo
So aesthetic

Name: Zachary Knight  Age: 21 Location: Lancaster, South Carolina First off I would use the money to start off my life by buying an apartment and finally move out. Then take half of it and give it to my parents for another down payment for a house for them so I can help them move out of the home we are in now. Thirdly I would use the rest and probly buy out my old part time job and start my own business mainly bc I don't want my old job I worked at for years to shut down 😓
Beautiful whole appartment is perfect love it 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖

James, i really hope you see this. Im your biggest fan <3 ive got your pallet, setting spray and brushes. But one thing, i know you love coke but they sponsor rodeos and rodeos abuse animals :(  so ive stopped drinking it bc i dont want to support them if all the money is just going to go to rodeos. I love you so much im your biggest sister EVERRRRRRRR
🦋🦋🦋Leilani Garciaparra🦋🦋🦋 ☆20 years old  ☆Joshua Tree, CA  ☆Social media I have & follow you on <3 Instagram: lanigyo  Snapchat: lanigyo  Tiktok: lanigyo Twitter: suplani  🌺If I were able to win the grand prize of $20,000 I would use it to invest in my priorities and set myself up for success. I would finally be able to put a down payment on a comfortable place for my fiancé and I instead of the tiny trailer we live in that lacks the basic necessities of a working kitchen and bathroom. It has been difficult but, It works until we are able to get on our feet and afford a nice place to call home and I can't wait for that moment! 💎 It would be the beginning to my new journey on my own from Seattle to Joshua Tree, CA with my love. I would also be able to put a down payment on a nice new reliable car instead of the Facebook market cars I can only afford that always have issues. My car hasn't been registered since 2013 lol 😂🚓 Most importantly, I would finally be able to go back to college and focus on my dream career of becoming a dental hygienist! 🦷This grand prize would help me get my life started and I would finally be able to focus on the bigger picture instead of the constant little worries of not having a comfortable place to call home and continuing to have to put aside my career due to lack of money and trying to find that stability I need first. I hope, wish, and pray that you consider me for this grand opportunity. This really could be the beginning and the boast I've been really needing during these hard times. Thank you James for the consideration! you're so kind and giving and have been my inspiration for years. You're an absolute icon. Love you Sister! 💫💕
This is incredible, I’m proud of you :)
Your home is beautifully decorated. Congratulations, James!
Literally a dream house omg i can’t believe
Super in love with your house it’s beautiful and a dream home congratulations sister I dream to one day have my own as well I know hard work will one day show💅🏼🔥❤️

.................. $100,000???????? uhh helloooo WHAT
Lilyanna Lopez 13 Atascadero, California  Hi James, I would live to use this money to help my mom. She’s been a single mother her whole life with guys that suck and do nothing to help. I live with my mom and sister in a two bedroom apartment and we have been saving to get a house for awhile now and the money would really help. I doubt you would see this but if you do thank you for giving a chance to change peoples life’s <3
My name is Zayda Bustos I am 18 turning 19 in November  I live in Los Angeles, California, USA Insta: kimmy.bustos Snapchat: kimmy.bustos TikTok: kimmy.bustos  Twitter: BustosKimmy Dear James, First of all I want to thank you for giving people a chance to win the money. I am so proud of how far you have come. With $20,000 I would first pay my moms debt. Then I would help fix her car. Then I would get us a better apartment with more space. I would get my sister a computer for school & her dream shoes. I would also just help my mom pay monthly bills. It would be such a blessing to finally help my mom who’s a single mother of 2 and has been thru so much and has helped push us forward thru life after having to go thru what she has I would be so greatful for this opportunity. My mom has been thru 22 surgeries while being a single mother and never gave up till this day she still pushes thru to give us everything we need. Hopefully we can get the chance to win this🤍

Congratulations James Charles on your new home. When it comes to food it's generally what do you want to eat and now a days it's all about what's healthy. But lots of us have cheat days. I attended the culinary institute of America and they generally spit out really good chefs and cooks that work from fine dining to anywhere. So in short ask what do you want to eat. Quinoa cauliflower chicken fish farm fresh etc?
Melanie  16  Location:Singapore  why: My Friend Beullah entered this too and I do not want her to win other than that I Want to pay for my college as my parents are very old and going to retire soon and I want them to rest :)

25  Ig _emyweee Location: Orange County Ca ☀️  A sister for years now!! I love you James. So grateful I’m even getting the opportunity to submit this entry! I would use the money to help my parents pay off debt. I would also use the money to buy a house for my husband and I. Who works so hard. we’ve been in apartment for a few years now. Pick me James! I have not been able to find work since March 🙏🏽
Let's admit it, the boy has taste. Beautiful house. Congrats.
Name: Kinsley Age: 18 Location: California Use of Money: I would use the money to pay for my college funds, my parents are unable to pay for the college tuition and it is difficult to live and pay in California along with college tuition even if you have a job. Without help I would fall into major student debt which could take years to pay off.
Name: Ayaka Kajiyama  Age: 21  Location: Japan Instagram: katerinayaka_ Why: my family has been rescuing cats and we have 9 cats in my house. But 3 of them are not doing well and every week we go the hospital and pay more than 400 dollars. It’s been a tough year for my mom, my grandmother(her mom) passed away so it means a world to me if we win this giveaways and help my cats get better and help my mom with the bills. I love you so much keep inspiring people you’re amazing❤️
Hi sister!! ❤️ I think it’s amazing what you do! I would buy my own salon as my passion in life if hair and make up etc I would also spend it on make up lessons as I would love to be as good as you! Keep doing what your doing! You make me smile just listening to you ❤️
Greta Kerwin 19 New York, US I would probably use this money to pay off college and help with family payments. But I would also use some to finally invest in make-up, skincare, and haircare products that are good quality and will actually make a difference visually. I am going to school to be a chemical engineer so I can make good quality cosmetics and I believe having some might be useful as well.
My dream home 😭

My name:Zhara Guzman Age :14  State:Utah  Why: I am from Venezuela and I don't know if you know, but Venezuela is in great need at the moment because they had to leave the country to be able to have some food to give their children and because my family went to Peru and they also suffer.  a lot there are even days when they have nothing to eat and have to go to work very early in the morning and arrive very late at night to be able to have money to pay the rent and for that reason I would like to earn 20,000 because that could help me a lot  family My mother, my stepfather and my brothers came to the United States two years ago, we lived in an apartment in Utah but we used to live in Idaho Falls and since we arrived in the United States they have not been able to buy a house and my mother works and my stepfather  Work  and they need in  many cases to send money to my family because they do not have enough money to be able to buy things like food or pay the rent
is this the same house?

I’m sister jealous
Katy Nicholls 18 Sydney Aus  I would use this money to help out my mother who has a business. She has spent the last 20 years making minimum wage - less than her employees, working 7 days a week most weeks and I think she’s only had 6 weeks off in those 20 years (including having a baby- she was back at work 3 days after having me) it has always been her passion to have a thriving business and unfortunately she never gets as much as she gives especially from employees with bad work ethic. I hope you see this ❤️
This house is amazing and I'd be so grateful to win the 20,000 I would definitely use it to basically pay off my car to help with one less bill every month that would be amazing right now. My insta username is @matysiak23 snap hat is  itsbrittneybitch(i mean come on i had to lol) and Facebook is just my name Brittney matysiak I'm 31 with 2 kids that I try to give the world to and I would just be honored if u picked me ❤❤❤ sister for life 😁😁
Thee house is soo cooll❤💖❤💖💗😭💗😭
Congrats sister!❤️❤️🥳
Hi James! My name is Makayla williams I am 18 years old from Washington state! @funnystarhoe- tiktok @kayla_02g insta  I am currently getting prepared to go to college for my freshman year! My family has struggled so much this year and previous years and 20,000 dollars would go a long way in my home. If I won 20,000 dollars I would start 4 bank accounts for my younger sisters so that they could start out a savings account since I know my parents struggle with that. I would also pay my families rent so they could stop stressing about winter and Christmas time. And then after I help out my family I would use the rest of the money for extra college finnancial help❤️ I wish the best of luck to everyone out there and I hope that whoever wins can finally get the help and or things the need!❤️
Name: Kenza  Age:17 Location: Miami Florida  I would like to win the 20k because I could help my parents out with paying some of there house mortgage and help them get out of debt and also would like to take them on a shopping spree and a day of relaxation by themselves because all they do is work really hard for us to have a really good life it would be a big blessing  Socials: Instagram: kenzasaja Snapchat: kenza_6930 Tik tok: kenzasaja

First time viewing your videos...love watching your bubbly and sweet personality....you complement your home because you are as beautiful as it is....and your kitchen is absolutely amazing and love the Coca Cola cellar....so happy for you
Sandy Tomeo (sct_graphics) Location: Glassboro, NJ Age: my daughter will be 17  Why: I would use the money to start a brand new life for my baby girl ( who is having her own baby girl on October 15th) and myself. We want to move out of NJ to someplace better. Someplace prettier. Some place that will offer both my baby girl and eventually her baby better opportunities. We’re struggling to save with the new little one coming and all, and we’ve had to postpone our plans yet again. It would be so very nice for us to be able to bring up my new Grandaughter in a new and wonderful place. We were hoping to move by at least January, but life keeps knocking us back a few steps. I love my daughter more than life, and want her to be happy always. She’s so miserable here.
Your house that looks like my dream house!!
How much was this house
Katie 20  Iowa city, Iowa  I’m a full time college student working two jobs right now to get me by. I would use the money to support my education and help pay for my rent! I would also put the money towards helping my parents, in Iowa we just had a huge storm (the derecho if you didn’t hear about it) and it really damaged my parents crops which is what they live off of. Giving them that money would help out a ton and i know helping them out would mean the world to them as well! Insta @katiegarnant Twitter @katiegarnant

Roshane 17 Instagram: rogotfanns United States..  I wrote a paragraph but I’m not sure it was saved.. nevertheless,  I would use the funds from this giveaway to help with my college tuition.  I was born in the island of Jamaica and 3 years ago migrated to the United States. Due to this,  I never started or began a college savings until this year. Working at McDonald’s rn trying to save $50 a check isn’t helping due to me being a senior this year. This 20,000 will be a HUGHHH relief for me and my single mother who is struggling with many responsibilities to make me happy.. and this is one issue that can go away from her mind if  My college fund is filled. Thank youu for listening

Hiiii babe! First off, the fact you’re giving away this amount of money is unreal. You’re an angel on this Earth. Second, I’m just popping in to tell you why I want to win this giveaway. I’m 20 and live in Miami, FL. Growing up, life was tough for the most part. my family was ALWAYS tight on money. With that being said, if I won I’d help my mom out. Maybe pay off her debt, idk where I’d start really. She’s 43 and has raised all 5 of us on her own with no help. I saw her struggle everyday but I never saw her give up. She truly deserves the world. This would be a dream + more 😭😭😭😭  twitter handle @kaymbp insta @0kaymb

Kaylan  24 Detroit and New York City I own a business with my family that focus on rebuilding the urban communities in Detroit and replacing all the abandoned neighborhoods with new builds and new home to bring life back to the city I grew up in. 20k would be a major help in securing a lot of land for development in the community. Being 24 and asking for finding is a major hassle!

Ashley Eng: 20 years old // Houston, Texas Instagram, twitter, and tiktok handles: @ashley_engg  /// snapchat: @ashley_eng WHY: If I had the privileged to win $20,000, I would give it all to my momma. Everything she has done for me, all her sacrifices, this amount of money would never be nearly enough to repay her. All of my life, my mommy has sacrificed her happiness and her education to raise my siblings and I and put us through school. For 19-20 years, the majority of my life, my family has lived in a hoarder house... and it is no exaggeration. Behind closed doors, years of arguing and emotional scarring has taken a heavy tool on my mom, my siblings, and I. On the outside, I may seem like a normal student with a normal life, but behind closed doors, you will never see the real life that someone lives. Each year I ask my mom to let us leave.. to finally allow her to be happy and to live the life she has always dreamed of, but every year she tells me "we will the next year when I earn enough money". But every year we stay, because there are endless bills of thousand dollars of debt and bills to pay and expenses. She chooses to stay in a house with someone that has caused her years of torment, for her family and in order to help her kids and her parents and her other family members. My mom has always be this kindhearted angel that took care of her uncle and her parents and every single person in the family, no matter if she had the money or not, and no matter if her own life situation was hard. She never let anyone know, but I have seen her breakdown and cry in my arms about being so sad and unhappy and tired of everything.. My siblings and I work hard everyday to try to alleviate the weight on my mom's shoulders. My momma has told me that after I graduate, that is when she will try to leave, because she won't have enough money to support me on my own now... Even now, my mom struggles to get me through school and has to ask my siblings for favors. Every chance I get, I try to take part-time jobs or random jobs to try to not be a burden on my mom, but it's hard to know that she is staying in this situation for a couple more years, because of me.. First it was going to be "when I graduated high school", then it's "when I graduate college", but every moment that my mom suffers in silence, makes me feel like a burden. I know that this money isn't that much, in perspective of helping clear my mom's debt and her responsibilities, but it would be such a blessing if I could give her this to help her even a little to try and start anew. I don't even need this money for myself, because I do not mind working hard for my own earnings and trying to give my earnings to my mom. I choose a career that is driven by passion and love (and not money), and my mom has always been supportive of that.. but sometimes I think I am being selfish and I want to quit in order to take care of my mom like she has taken care of me. But my mom encourages me to follow my dreams, despite what she has to sacrifice and her sufferings.. and I just wish I could be more than just a burden.   But even if I wasn't chosen, that is okay too. I will continue to work hard and make my momma proud. Thank you for taking the time to read this. And I hope you and everyone are staying safe and healthy. Thank you James for being an inspiration to many and it is always a pleasure to watch your videos. <3

Tanya G 18 New Jersey  @balloonsbytanya I just started college and my hours conflicted with my job so I had to leave and I recently started a balloon business. I don’t really have social media so it’s been a journey to promote and get my business name around. The money would really help me out towards helping pay for my textbooks (I got an academic scholarship so thankfully I could afford college), invest in my business because I’m really trying to make it big to support myself, and as for the rest I would set aside for an apartment or house which my boyfriend and I dream about getting in the near future.
i’m also 22

I would use the money to not only start paying off my student loans but to purchase myself a brand new car, my car is 12 years old and falling apart day by day.. the bumper is literally strapped to it 🥴🥴 I am 21 and fully support myself which is very hard most days. It would mean the absolute world to me if I could get the chance to win a portion of the $100,000.  Thank you. Much love & blessings 💞🙏🏼 -Bailee Jaume, 21 New Orleans, Louisiana  IG/Twitter: baileejaume
You literally are living in my dream house!! I love it so much. I’m so happy and proud of you for being able to live your dream❤️

Hi I’m Lara, I’m 21, and a hair stylist. It would be so awesome to get 20k to start off my own suite and will help a lot with debt in general. I’ve been trying to make bigger productions for my photos to advertise myself and I just don’t have the money to make that happen right now so this would be so helpful. I’ve also been looking into starting my own hair care brand and have been planning that out but just don’t have the funds yet. You inspire me so much to go for what I love and that’s what I’m doing now and working on. I can’t for all the beautiful blessings coming your way james❤️🤍✨✨✨

Can I live with you xD
Hi! I’m Katy & I’m 25. I would use $20000 to put towards my loans for my BSBA. I work for an accounting firm while I’m in my last year of school. I have recently started taking on my own personal clients, so i would use a portion to take that to the next level.  My insta is @katyspears
I'm so confused ... Did he not own the house he's been living in for a while? Is this the same building? What.?
Davon 21  Nashville,tn  Pay off my debt that I have and give back to my mom for everything she has done
Sarah Terry  19 Missouri, USA Insta/Twitter: sarahterry_ snap: sarmarie15  I would use $20,000 to help my mom pay off part of her house. She works so hard like many other single parents. All of my friends know just how giving she is to other people. She rarely just focuses on herself. It’s time for me to give back. I would also use this money to help my boyfriend move to my area from 3 hours away. The plan is to move early in 2021, but moving trucks and deposits on apartments are so expensive and I would love to make it easier for him. Anything else that remains would go directly to savings to put towards a down payment on a house in the next two years or so. xoxo 🥺💗

Bring back games with James!
Hey James. My name is Kelsie. I would use the money for a few different things.  1) My College - To further my education and future job in accounting and management. This would help me pay off my school loans. 2) Moving Out - Me and my best friend are saving up to move out and this would help tremendously. I work 2 jobs and this would help relieve some stress.  3) Charity - If I were to win, it’s always good to give back. I would give a bit to a few different charities. It is always better to give than receive, so why not pass on the fortune to someone else, who also needs the money.   If you read this, I love your videos and I am so impressed by how successful you are at such a young age. Definitely someone to look up to :)  @krice1223 on Instagram Age: 21 Location: Ohio

May GOD bless you with many more accomplished goals! I find it amazing that you show love to your fans and doing a monetary giveaway! It’s an amazing opportunity for college students like me, who come from immigrant parents and low-income family. I would use the $20,000 for optometry school, which btw I’m applying to this year! By paying tuition, I’ll be one step closer to become a first generation Eye Doctor & Minor surgery Optometrist! This will allow me to change lives by fixing people’s vision. I believe our world is beautiful and everyone deserves to SEE it as it is!  🤍 I will also be able to give back to my family who has been through a lot of hardships.   Good luck everyone!

Hi James my name is Stefanie and I’m 13 turning 14 in October and if I won those 20,000 dollars the first thing i would do is help my mom pay all her debits and the nexts thing I would do is see if with that money I can buy her  dream home because since I was younger my dream has always been to buy my mom a house because I always had to see her  struggling to pay bills or car Insurance and having to take care of my brother and me ,I honestly hate having to see her struggle and it’s the most painful thing to watch she has always been an independent woman never asking anyone for help but I know that it’s tough dealing with everything on your own and if there was still some money I would help my grandpa and uncle get there own car shop because my uncle and grandpa started a car business like probably 2 or a year ago where they get broken down cars and fix them up and sell them but they have to work in their front yard and there has been so many complaints from the neighbors and they don’t have a lot of space for their cars and with their car shop they can start to get more cars and be able to get more work done and thank you for reading this and I hope I get chosen because this would help my family so much and I just put all my faith in god amen🙏🏼
*this calls me poor in all languages*

Hi James! My name is Grace Linson and I am a 19! My Instagram is @757.grace  If I happened to be lucky enough to win $20,000 I would firstly take my boyfriend and family out to dinner. I would then pay off my car and my students loans. Then I would put a deposit on an apartment or home. Winning so much money could really help me. Being 19 and already in so much debt is so stressful. A weight would be lifted off my shoulders and I would be so very very grateful.
You have no ideas how a blessing that would be too so many people you giving away alot of money, super generous and grateful.  I’m from Orange  , California I’m 18 gonna be 19 in 1 month I’m the oldest daughter so it is pretty tough trying to help out my family and set a “good example or watever” the best I can.  First off all I would save and invest the money if I win pray to god I do , for my family so my family doesn’t have to work 9-5 anymore bc there getting to a point where they are not able to work anymore. Thx sister James twitter @ joclynbricia Instagram  @joclynnxn ⚡️💗

Name: Eric Wakeham Age: 19 Instagram: ericwakeham Location: Scotland, United Kingdom  Reason: Hey James. My reason is to help me finally get top surgery and help me with my transition from FTM.
Hiiii sister! First off, the fact you’re giving away this amount of money is unreal. You’re an angel on this Earth. Second, I’m just popping in to tell you why I want to win this giveaway. I’m 20 and live in Miami, FL. Growing up, life was tough for the most part. my family was ALWAYS tight on money. With that being said, if I won I’d help my mom out. She’s 43 and has raised all 5 of us on her own with no help. I saw her struggle everyday but I never saw her give up. She truly deserves the world. This would be a dream + more 😭😭😭😭  twitter handle @kaymbp insta @0kaymb tiktok @kayelahmb 😭🤞🏼

Ashley Eng I am 20 years old and I am from Houston, Texas Instagram, twitter, and tiktok handles: @ashley_engg  /// snapchat: ashley_eng - If I had the privileged to win $20,000, I would give it all to my momma. Everything she has done for me, all her sacrifices, this amount of money would never be nearly enough to repay her. All of my life, my mommy has sacrificed her happiness and her education to raise my siblings and I and put us through school. For 19-20 years, the majority of my life, my family has lived in a hoarder house... and it is no exaggeration. Behind closed doors, years of arguing and emotional scarring has taken a heavy tool on my mom, my siblings, and I. On the outside, I may seem like a normal student with a normal life, but behind closed doors, you will never see the real life that someone lives. Each year I ask my mom to let us leave.. to finally allow her to be happy and to live the life she has always dreamed of, but every year she tells me "we will the next year when I earn enough money". But every year we stay, because there are endless bills of thousand dollars of debt and bills to pay and expenses. She chooses to stay in a house with someone that has caused her years of torment, for her family and in order to help her kids and her parents and her other family members. My mom has always be this kindhearted angel that took care of her uncle and her parents and every single person in the family, no matter if she had the money or not, and no matter if her own life situation was hard. She never let anyone know, but I have seen her breakdown and cry in my arms about being so sad and unhappy and tired of everything.. My siblings and I work hard everyday to try to alleviate the weight on my mom's shoulders. My momma has told me that after I graduate, that is when she will try to leave, because she won't have enough money to support me on my own now... Even now, my mom struggles to get me through school and has to ask my siblings for favors. Every chance I get, I try to take part-time jobs or random jobs to try to not be a burden on my mom, but it's hard to know that she is staying in this situation for a couple more years, because of me.. First it was going to be "when I graduated high school", then it's "when I graduate college", but every moment that my mom suffers in silence, makes me feel like a burden. I know that this money isn't that much, in perspective of helping clear my mom's debt and her responsibilities, but it would be such a blessing if I could give her this to help her even a little to try and start anew. I don't even need this money for myself, because I do not mind working hard for my own earnings and trying to give my earnings to my mom. I choose a career that is driven by passion and love (and not money), and my mom has always been supportive of that.. but sometimes I think I am being selfish and I want to quit in order to take care of my mom like she has taken care of me. But my mom encourages me to follow my dreams, despite what she has to sacrifice and her sufferings.. and I just wish I could be more than just a burden.   But even if I wasn't chosen, that is okay too. I will continue to work hard and make my momma proud. Thank you for taking the time to read this. And I hope you and everyone are staying safe and healthy. Thank you James for being an inspiration to many and it is always a pleasure to watch your videos. <3

Oliver - he/him 14  Olliebroxton5   Hiya James   First of all I think it’s so amazing that you are giving back and now helping the community with the privilege you’ve been given it’s really what you want from the influencers of today!   If I won 20,000 I would donate a lot of it and help spread awareness for a disease called pulmonary fibrosis
Maleeka Thomas  19  Alberta Canada  I would pay for my college tuition with the 20,000 to future my education and become the attorney I dream of being
Kayleigh 22 North East UK Insta: @_mmmkay__ Save for a house as I might be made redundant very soon
I would use the 20,000 to buy myself a prosthetic for my left arm. I recently became amputated this year due to an incident at my college. I had to drop out for the mean time and would also use it to pay hospital bills bc the sxhool is not helping. insta: brujitabonita twitter: succubusgutz age 19 illinois  i don’t wanna put my snapchat or city on here cuz it’s private 😭 but yeah

✨🌈This is worth a try! Hi James I'm about to be 16 in like Two months! If I win the money I'd probably buy a house like you, a decent house with atleast two bathrooms and three rooms with a nice neighborhood! Or I would split it all with my fam! Thankyou!!✨🌈
Hi james charles... Im like your biggest fan since like 2017... And like for the money i would really really like to win the giveaway i talked to my mom about it and she said i could try to win i... Most of the money will go to my family, some of it will go to homeless peiple if my mom allows me and the rest of the money will go to my uncles family because he needs it and to my aunts family but thr problem is i live in canada and ive never won a giveaway before but it would be really really exiting if i won this one! I would scream!! And btw thats not a problem besides living in canada.... This is For your newest video about your house tour number 2!:) ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
If I won I would buy the most beautiful piece of land that this money would afford. I would build the small, sustainable,  off grid home of my dreams and share it with my husband and 2 boys. I would grow and cultivate my own foods and share the bounty with anyone who needed it. I would work hard every single day. James,  of course you would be invited to come and enjoy the property anytime you needed peace and tranquility. I would pay all of my first fruits to God. I will fulfill this dream either way but this money would further that dream quickly. Sincerely, Dianna IG: diannadeniece Twitter: dodsondianna Age:29
Name: Dre’Niyah Santiago Age:13 Social media  Instagram: Niyahgotbankpt2 Twitter:DreNiyah1 Snapchat:bemorelikeniyah   I would like the 20,000 because my mom is struggling to find a new house and she doesn’t have the money to buy me new clothes since I am growing out of all my clothes we are currently living with my auntie with a whole other family and this would help a lot thank you..
Okay did anyone else tear up? James did it guys!! He’s living an absolute dream! You are a true inspiration💛   Name: Lesley Felix Age: 23  Location: Janesville, Wisconsin   Instagram: Lesley_Felix Facebook: Lesley Felix TikTok: Lesley_Felix Snapchat: Lesley_Felix  This money would help me and my daughter so much. I am a single mom busting my butt to make ends meet. I would pay off all our medical bills and debts. My mother is my #1 supporter and has been my role model since day 1. I would put a down payment on a house for her. Or buy her car since hers always breaks down. I want want to live a life worry free of debt. $20,000 would solve a lot. That would be the biggest blessing to us.   Best of luck everyone✨🤞🏼

Have you ever dated anyone? Xx
I like his house but I feel like it lacks major personality. I feel like he spent a few days on Pinterest and decided to make his house exactly like those houses on Pinterest. James is a really lively and creative person so I thought his house would reflect that. It is beautiful though
When he says “Back here is where Lewis’ bedroom is” I thought he was walking into the laundry room and I was like well dang poor Lewis 10:39
I preferred his old house. I don't like the kitchen
Who’s here from willne?
:P omg I love his dogs 😍
It needs a bit of colour James.  The white walls are very bland. Broaden your horizons

Carolina Bossio  18  Miami, Florida Insta: business  page: @kuc_glam. main page: @lxnx_caro Why: the reason why I want to be the winner for the 20,000 dollars is because it’s Been a dream of mine to finally open up my online clothing store and nail supply store and salon. I want to invest this money in my business 100%. I pray you see this because it will drastically change my life and my entire family💕 I'm praying and manifesting that I win that 20,000 will really impact my life I've had such high hopes for my future ever since I was young and this money will truly impact in ways you wouldn't imagine. I'm going to start a YouTube channel for my nails soon as well to get more notice to form a fan base.

Name: Matthew Vincelet Age: 20 Location: Stockton, CA, United States SOCIAL MEDIA HANDLES: INSTAGRAM: @_mattbigpimpin13_ TWITTER: @_mattpimpin13_ SNAPCHAT: @soccerpimp13 TIKTOK: @matthewvincelet1  If I won the $20,000, I would probably do a couple of things. I am in school right now attending CSU Stanislaus full-time and I am in my Junior Year of college. I am studying to be a lawyer because of how our justice system is structured and how injustice it can be at times. That is my goal, is to advocate for change in the world and make people feel safe in their own homes, safe when they go to the store, safe when they are sitting in their car, and safe in their own bed while they are sleeping. It is very important to me people understand that we all bleed the same color and need to fight for change in the world and stand up for what is right.   SO, I would spend the $20,000 on my education/student loans that I have already taken out. I would spend the remainder of the $20,000 on a down payment on a house. I have a puppy named Bentley that is SOOOOOO cute and lovable and very playful! I live in a studio apartment with him right now and he has no where to really play or run around or none of that good stuff I feel a puppy should have. I have been trying to get a house, but need a down payment to get a home. So, I would definitely invest in a house so my dog has somewhere to play and BE A PUPPY!   My education and owning a home are probably the two most important things to me in my life right now, and this $20,000 would contribute to making those two things possible for me! It would change my life and I would be so grateful, thankful, appreciative, blessed, honored, and humbled if I won!   I HOPE I WIN AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY!
Bruh design my house please 😻
2020 is your yearrrr🥳
His house and floor plan reminds me SO much of Remi Ashten's house.

Hey sister, my name is Ciara, I am 30  and living in Dublin, Ireland🇮🇪 @TheDefiled666    Twitter @dixiewhiskey17        Instagram @CiaraNicGiollaPhadraig.       Facebook  I would definitely use the money as a deposit to buy an apartment for myself my boyfriend Joe and our 11 year old Staffy Loki😍 We are really struggling to find a place as house prices and rents are so high now in Dublin.  Enjoy the new place, you deserve it😍😘
Name: Ashley Eng Age: 20 years old  Location: Houston, Texas Instagram handle: ashley_engg If I had the privileged to win $20,000, I would give it all to my momma. Everything she has done for me, all her sacrifices, this amount of money would never be nearly enough to repay her. All of my life, my mommy has sacrificed her happiness and her education to raise my siblings and I and put us through school. For 19-20 years, the majority of my life, my family has lived in a hoarder house... and it is no exaggeration. Behind closed doors, years of arguing and emotional scarring has taken a heavy tool on my mom, my siblings, and I. On the outside, I may seem like a normal student with a normal life, but behind closed doors, you will never see the real life that someone lives. Each year I ask my mom to let us leave.. to finally allow her to be happy and to live the life she has always dreamed of, but every year she tells me "we will the next year when I earn enough money". But every year we stay, because there are endless bills of thousand dollars of debt and bills to pay and expenses. She chooses to stay in a house with someone that has caused her years of torment, for her family and in order to help her kids and her parents and her other family members. My mom has always be this kindhearted angel that took care of her uncle and her parents and every single person in the family, no matter if she had the money or not, and no matter if her own life situation was hard. She never let anyone know, but I have seen her breakdown and cry in my arms about being so sad and unhappy and tired of everything.. My siblings and I work hard everyday to try to alleviate the weight on my mom's shoulders. My momma has told me that after I graduate, that is when she will try to leave, because she won't have enough money to support me on my own now... Even now, my mom struggles to get me through school and has to ask my siblings for favors. Every chance I get, I try to take part-time jobs or random jobs to try to not be a burden on my mom, but it's hard to know that she is staying in this situation for a couple more years, because of me.. First it was going to be "when I graduated high school", then it's "when I graduate college", but every moment that my mom suffers in silence, makes me feel like a burden. I know that this money isn't that much, in perspective of helping clear my mom's debt and her responsibilities, but it would be such a blessing if I could give her this to help her even a little to try and start anew. I don't even need this money for myself, because I do not mind working hard for my own earnings and trying to give my earnings to my mom. I choose a career that is driven by passion and love (and not money), and my mom has always been supportive of that.. but sometimes I think I am being selfish and I want to quit in order to take care of my mom like she has taken care of me. But my mom encourages me to follow my dreams, despite what she has to sacrifice and her sufferings.. and I just wish I could be more than just a burden.  But even if I wasn't chosen, that is okay too. I will continue to work hard and make my momma proud. Thank you for taking the time to read this. And I hope you and everyone are staying safe and healthy. Thank you James for being an inspiration to many and it is always a pleasure to watch your videos. <3
James can YOU do a asmr please thank such im  big fan
I'm not trying to be that guy but the part of the house he's in the beginning reminds me Jenna marbles house?

PLEASE READ: Carmen Perdomo 18 Phone: 616-929-3754 Grand Rapids, Michigan Why: FAMILY- six years ago a huge part of my family moved to Barcelona Spain, including my cousins who are twins. We where in the same grade, so growing up we where ALLWAYS together even in class and outside of school, I almost felt as tho we where triplets (I’m only a month older). Ever since they moved away, for all these years, most nights I’ve had the same dreams of going to Spain seeing them again and having the best time with them, but then I wake up and it all goes away. I miss my family so much, but I would have to wait years to see them again one day. Why give me the money? Because you would QUITE LITERALLY make my dreams come true. (Of coarse i would wait for a safe time to travel and I would be safe and wear masks) I know this is a long shot but please consider choosing me James 💕 ily   WHERE I FOLLOW YOU Insta: Carmen.oxox Twitter: carmen_3754 Snapchat: carmen_3754 TikTok: Sam.3758

Anndee Barr 20 Anndee_barr (insta) (I don’t have a Twitter or tik tok but I followed you on the rest!!) Louisiana, United States I would tithe to my local church to help them continue to improve their buildings after the 2016 great flood hit in my city (they are still updating buildings from that disaster) along with using it to help me and others go on missionary trips......I have never been on one and reallyyyyy wanna go and help people in need. I would also use it to help me go to MBA school and go out of state to learn Spanish and be fluent at it so I can become more flexible in my future field (healthcare management)
Coke cellar? That doesn’t sound sketchy at all
willne?
It’s the oversized vest that doesn’t go with the outfit and look looks like you’re a little kid who stole his fathers clothes for me😐
Not that vest that doesn’t go with the outfit and looks like you’re a little boy trying to fit into his dad‘s clothes 😬

Yvonnie Bryant 29 Phoenix, Arizona  Instagram: @ yvonniebryant Snapchat: ybryant I am paying out of pocket for school to get my BA at UA. I can only afford to take 1-2 classes a semester, so winning will definitely speed up my graduation date. With the remaining, I would want to pay off my moms debt. She does a lot for my sister and I so it would be nice to do something for her. Thank you so much for this opportunity for everyone.  Your house is gorgeous! 😍
Dream house, your taste is immaculate 💫

🤍✨ My name is Claudia Torres✨🤍 My Instagram: @Clawde.a I’m 19 years old and I currently live in Arizona and I just graduated high school. I was love to use the money for my education onto becoming a dental assistant.... it’s a start I want to help people feel confident and in their own smiles... It would really help me because my student loan doesn’t cover everything and I’ve been working two jobs at Target and Walmart which is stressful. Since I’m also Trying to save up money as well for a car. It’s really hard to save money when I have to lyft and take the bus to work or school because my parents aren’t willing to take me nor help me... so The money would be COMPLETELY HELPFUL and I would be honored and sooo appreciated if I earn this giveaway, but by the way congratulations. So proud of you!

Jeannie Lozowski 22 Philadelphia, PA instagram: @justjeanniemarie Hi James! My name is Jeannie and I am a current nursing masters student at the University of Pennsylvania. I grew up playing tennis competitively and was even able to compete as a Division One athlete until I sustained a serious wrist injury, which unfortunately ended my career. Giving up a sport that meant so much to me was heartbreaking, but it made me focus more on my passion of helping and serving others. I was able to work with the nonprofit organizations: "Love Serving Autism" and "Aceing Autism" which teaches and connects individuals with autism through tennis programs. The game of tennis has made such a positive influence on their lives by providing them an outlet to be active, form friendships, and even have fun. These organizations have been such a big influence on my life as well as it shaped my passion to serve individuals with autism and led me to pursue nursing as a career. I am currently at the nations #1 Ivy League Nursing school in the country which will help me to become one of the nations top Nurse Practitioners specialized in advancing care for individuals with autism. If I were to win the $20,000, I would pay off some of my loans from attending school as well as open up my own clinic and non-profit that treats autistic individuals. It is my ultimate goal to advance research behind autism and combine my passion of tennis and healthcare to improve the lives of individuals that face various autism spectrum disorders. I really hope that you will consider me for this giveaway and thank you for inspiring me daily :)  -Jeannie

i would use the money to get my life started and start doing the things i really want in life, which is paying off college, finishing college. but first its moving out of my dads house. I am currently working 3 jobs on top of going to school full time just to save up enough money to move out of my fathers house. I want to be a trauma therapist for children and that is a lot of schooling. I don't have the time to work 3 jobs This money would only not help me get out of my toxic state (GA) but it would really help me to start my life and get things going for myself. my name is lexie dennis ig handle : lexiedennis, and my age is 20.

Armando Vega 17 Nevada, United States Insta: Arrmandhoe I would love the $20,000 because I would want to take my family on a luxury vacation since we haven’t been on a vacation as a family since 2013. Reason being. My parents don’t get holiday breaks. And can only get 2 weeks off within the whole year. My sister is in the army, and I haven’t seen her in 1 year and 5 months. When she visits she’s only comes for a week. It isn’t enough but she’s coming home on September 28th and I want to eat that Gordon Ramsay’s kitchen where I live in Las Vegas. Because I think my family deserves a nice rich meal for the weekend, and short vacation to California or something ❤️

As a first generation college student, and one with no financial support from my parents I would put money towards my college fund. I would also use a portion of the money as a down payment on a house! Any money leftover would be donated to give back to my community. Congratulations on 20 million subscribers, I could only dream of success like yours. Much love❤️
It’s kinda sad cuz  James closet is the size of my bedroom

Hi James
how to sell a big ass house in 17 mins hmm plus part 2
Hi James!  If you see this pls read this.  I would love to participate in the give away because I work for an organization called CHIA. CHIA aka Christian Hands In Action is a non-profit organization, and we give free medical care to people all around the world. We treat people and we give them dental care, medical care, and we give hem medicine (legally) we also tell people about the gospel. We are baptist Christians. But, unfortunately, we don't have that much money to support CHIA anymore but we would love it if u can give u a small donation.  Thank u for everything you have done to inspire the world. Love You Sister 😘❤❤

Name: Anna Murphy Age: 29 Instagram: annalouisemurph  I can’t explain what it would mean to win the prize, I’ve been saving like crazy to buy my first home but recently found out I’m not quite there. Winning this prize would enable me to put a down payment on my house and finally make my house dreams come true. Watching your house tour gave me so much motivation to work harder and also absolute California modern interior design GOALS! Love you so much and so inspired by what a role model you have become!

My name is Iesha Joseph and if I won the $20,000 I will be able to get my building for my cooking business and I am be able to buy me a house because I have a third child on the way and we’re living in a two bedroom and right now my oldest and my youngest is in the same room together and we need a bigger house.

Hey James, your house is beautiful but have you ever thought about giving your life the Christ ☺️✨

I’m in love with the decor💜
Does James like not have a belly button or sum?
WOOHOO...Hi James and the Sister Squad. It's Greg here, writing to you from Australia. I have been embellishing eyewear for almost 10 year's and have just launch Banks Beauty. Natural skin care and beauty product's inspired by the art deco era. The 20K would be an unspeakable head start on some innovative product's I feel are needed in the beauty community. Even thou the product'd are natural, they are powerful and deliver. I have so many exciting project's I am currently testing/developing. Anyway, thank you so much for your time. Much love, Greg.

Hi! This will probably never happen but it’s worth the shot! I’ve followed you on all social media’s! Name:Cianna Rodgers Age:22  Location: Manistee Michigan   Why: My girlfriend and I currently live with my mother. Her and I own an adult foster care home for people with developmental disabilities, we take care of 6 people and we also take care of my Grammy..my girlfriend and I have been saving up to get a place of our own but of course life constantly throws obstacles at you..and now we are about $1000 behind of where we need to be to even be able to put a down payment on anything. My mom also has been very stressed about money so I need to do what’s right and help her as much as I can..I know this is contest is gonna be impossible and I probably won’t even be seen but it’s always worth a try! Thank you so much for helping people who are in need!!

Name: Megann Gragg Age: 19 Location: McAlester Oklahoma Insta: megann.gragg Why: Really hoping to win this because me and my boyfriend have been working hard to try and find our perfect home. Problems get in the way and it’s hard to save so much money to put a down payment. We are working hard to save but I’m praying and looking forward to winning this money so we are able to put a down payment on our very first home! We would be beyond excited and feel relieved to finally get out of my parents house. I love watching you and I enjoy every video that you make. I think it’s amazing you’re giving back because I know some people don’t like to do so💜 I pray that you see this thank you for doing this for all your fans!☺️ also I do want to say I don’t have Twitter I never have but I hope that you still consider me.

Annina Immoos 20 (soon 21) ♎️ Zürich, Switzerland Insta: anninaimmoos Twitter: anninaimmoos Snap: schokobabe36 (annina) TikTok: anninaimmoos0 How I would spend those 20‘000 $: Honestly I would love to start my own clothing brand. But I know before I can even think about something like that I have to support my family. So I would at least spend half of it to make sure my loved ones don't drown in the system.  After that, I would safe the rest and work as hard as I can to double it again...so I can start my company and maybe even get a new place to live as well as travel to L.A to finally meet u💕.  I could go on and on to get some more sympathy points, but I'm gonna leave it at that and just hope that ure gonna read this and maybe decide to make me one of the lucky few🤞🏼🍀 Either way, I love u and what u do. Ur lively and positive vibes has been helping me through a lot. THANK U! Keep doing what ure doing! Much love from a proud sister!🌸👹👹🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸 (I already put my comment on ur newest vid...so I thought putting in on both would double my chances😉)

🤍✨ My name is Claudia Torres✨🤍 My Instagram: @Clawde.a I’m 19 years old and I currently live in Arizona and I just graduated high school. I was love to use the money for my education onto becoming a dental assistant.... it’s a start I want to help people feel confident and in their own smiles... It would really help me because my student loan doesn’t cover everything and I’ve been working two jobs at Target and Walmart which is stressful. Since I’m also Trying to save up money as well for a car. It’s really hard to save money when I have to lyft and take the bus to work or school because my parents aren’t willing to take me nor help me... so The money would be COMPLETELY HELPFUL and I would be honored and sooo appreciated if I earn this giveaway, but by the way congratulations. So proud of you!

My dream house so dreamy
Name: Marshay Howliet Age: 21 Location: East Saint Louis, Illinois  Instagram: sshay_cashaee Reason: I could use the money give away for my personal reasons and business reasons. I want to start going nails and need some help getting started it is something I want to make a career out of, and doing it the proper way. I want to go to cosmetology school, but the position I’m in now I just can’t afford it so  this is another reason I decided to get a job were I did because I needed something quick in fast so I can get back on my feet. The only problem about my job is, I have to catch the bus two hours early to make it to work on time because I have no other way, and I don’t mind catching this bus but my shift is 3pm-11pm and being that it takes two hours to get back home I don’t make it until  1am . And my city is VERY dangerous and it scares me every noght walking home from the bus stop so late In fear that something might happened me.. but I don’t want to leave the job because the money is good and it’s what I need the most. But I also don’t wanna have to live in fear every night walking home. So this give away will help in multiple ways. By adding to my saving for a car & finally begin my journey with starting my career with doing nails.

Dream house...!!! Wow
Hey 😇 My name is Kiera and I’m 20 years old. I live in Bronx, Ny and honestly being able to move somewhere a bit inexpensive and still live in a decent area is something I’ve been trying to achieve for a while now. Coronavirus made it hard to find anything stable, in terms of working. Winning the giveaway would be a dream come true. 🤎 IG: _Ki_e_ra_ (underscores in the beginning and end)
I love you james💕 sadly 😥I have no social media so I can't win the moneythat I really need but I love you😍 please see this 🙏
I was just watching PewDiePie and now I ended up here. BEST DECISION EVER. I love this guy!!
Love his house!
Michelle Hernandez 18 California, United States Insta: mushell_28 Snap: peep3276 TikTok: hernandez_90 What would I do with 20,000 dollars? I would save up for school. I want to become a doctor and will be taking out multiple loans. Becoming a doctor has always been my dream since I was a little kid. I love helping people to my best ability. My family helps me with school and I save up. It is very troubling to think about expenses but I believe it will all be worth it. 20,000 dollars would help me and my family tremendously. Congrats James on your new house 🏡 and 20 million subs ✨!! Keep up the hard work 💕
omg ur house look like rebeca zemolos house =D i love u james charls
I think one of the couples from Vanderpump Rules moved into his old house. It looked familiar on the last episode I watched.
James I know you will probably not see this but can you please do games with James and play a game called Dead By Daylight
You like snacks put ranch powder  on popcorn🍿🤤

I never see the subtitle moving this fast.
i absolutely LOVE your new home ! this is the first big home i’ve seen that makes me think every room is necessary! it fits him so well! so happy for james ! 🤍🤍
Your house is beyond beautiful, James! It definitely fits you to a tea. 🌻  Name: Megan Myers Location: Ohio, United States Age: 24 Instagram: @marswrd  TikTok: @marswardd   If I won $20,000 or even $5,000 I would put it down towards a house. I am not able to move because I have an eviction that wasn’t my fault and it’s about $4,000 to pay off. I don’t feel safe in the area I am in, so I would definitely move somewhere better and catch up on bills to put me ahead. I would also help my friend who is in need. 🌻
КАК ВКЛЮЧИТЬ РУССКИЕ СУБТИТРЫ НИФИГА НЕ ПОНИМАЮ

Grace Sloan Macomb, Mi Insta: @graceesloann_ Twitter: @graceesloann02 TikTok: @gracesloan85  If I were to win the giveaway I would start paying off my student loans, help my sister who is a young single mother, and my family who has given up a lot to get me to where I am. Even though they live paycheck to paycheck and often struggle to make ends meet they always put others before themselves and I would do anything to help them out♥️ thank you James 🥰

Btw I've been watching you on and off forever and I'm so proud of how far you've come. Thanks for the years of quality entertainment sister! You deserve everything you have, you've earned it.
Hey James❤️  My names Regan kelly I’m 20  I live in Portland Oregon  My Instagram is regan.brianne With that much money I would use it to renovate a house my boyfriend and I were supposed to move into in may but was basically destroyed by some ( let’s just call them not good people).  I work two jobs to be able to support myself and start my saving after moving cities after I graduated, trying to adult is not all that easy. I would share with my parents they gave me everything in life support love and they came together to make me who I am today even though they have not been “together” since I could remember. I would also give back to local fundraising, charities, and those in need. Thank you for your big heart James FYI love the new home❤️

Ok I love everything about this house 😭😍
Name~ Alexis Dimond Age~ 19 Location~ New Hampshire Instagram~ Alexisgiannaa  My name is Alexis, I am 19 currently working full time as well as going to college full time in med school! I am an LNA and I care for residents that need assistance living their daily lives:). Sadly my grandpa is quickly declining and his dementia is getting to dangerous for him to stay home. If I was lucky enough to receive $20,000 I would get him into the nursing home I work at and help him get the help he needs. I also would buy residents clothes, soap, and other items in need, unfortunately a lot of them are not fortunate or do not have the money to get soap or clothing that fits them. I have bought them things on multiple occasions because of this and it makes me sad. As simple as it sounds these things mean the world to me. I love being able to help others in need even if it is hard on me!❤️ and James if you happen to read this, thank you for helping people the way you do it means more than you could imagine. One of my residents granddaughters watches your videos on her iPad and they both smile and love supporting you just as I do😊  Thank you for considering xoxo
name: Victoria Fox Location: STL Age: 22 Insta: toriifox What I would do w 20k: I would pay off my parents debt, help them and my 3 younger sisters out, and finish my degree since I would have $ to pay for it😭😭 You’re a beautiful soul & I’ve been following you from the beginning. Keep doing you!!❤️

Ashley Mancilla  Salt Lake City, Utah  22  Insta: Ashley_mancilla  If I won I would finish paying off my school  (I’ll have my bachelors degree in May!)  That will take the most chunk of change haha but it will be me and Vic’s 5 year anniversary in October. We had plans to go to Mexico, but unfortunately those plans have changed.  Instead, I would want us to be able to move and furnish a new place together.
Am I the only one thinking about how comfortable it would be to sleep outside in the fresh air ,in that master suit patio 😍😍😍🙌🏻 like OMGGG 😍😍
James: This is the room that is also the furthest from my room so when the parents come to visit it nice and far away 😊. Me: 🤣 James you kill me
James you're literally goals. I hope to buy my first house too when I have enough money and be successful.
He all ready got 21 million

love ya %1000000
This is the most aesthetic house I’ve ever seen... haha I’m so jealous 😂
Name: Ashley Eng Age: 20 years old  Location: Houston, Texas Instagram handle: ashley_engg If I had the privileged to win $20,000, I would give it all to my momma. Everything she has done for me, all her sacrifices, this amount of money would never be nearly enough to repay her. All of my life, my mommy has sacrificed her happiness and her education to raise my siblings and I and put us through school. For 19-20 years, the majority of my life, my family has lived in a hoarder house... and it is no exaggeration. Behind closed doors, years of arguing and emotional scarring has taken a heavy tool on my mom, my siblings, and I. On the outside, I may seem like a normal student with a normal life, but behind closed doors, you will never see the real life that someone lives. Each year I ask my mom to let us leave.. to finally allow her to be happy and to live the life she has always dreamed of, but every year she tells me "we will the next year when I earn enough money". But every year we stay, because there are endless bills of thousand dollars of debt and bills to pay and expenses. She chooses to stay in a house with someone that has caused her years of torment, for her family and in order to help her kids and her parents and her other family members. My mom has always be this kindhearted angel that took care of her uncle and her parents and every single person in the family, no matter if she had the money or not, and no matter if her own life situation was hard. She never let anyone know, but I have seen her breakdown and cry in my arms about being so sad and unhappy and tired of everything.. My siblings and I work hard everyday to try to alleviate the weight on my mom's shoulders. My momma has told me that after I graduate, that is when she will try to leave, because she won't have enough money to support me on my own now... Even now, my mom struggles to get me through school and has to ask my siblings for favors. Every chance I get, I try to take part-time jobs or random jobs to try to not be a burden on my mom, but it's hard to know that she is staying in this situation for a couple more years, because of me.. First it was going to be "when I graduated high school", then it's "when I graduate college", but every moment that my mom suffers in silence, makes me feel like a burden. I know that this money isn't that much, in perspective of helping clear my mom's debt and her responsibilities, but it would be such a blessing if I could give her this to help her even a little to try and start anew. I don't even need this money for myself, because I do not mind working hard for my own earnings and trying to give my earnings to my mom. I choose a career that is driven by passion and love (and not money), and my mom has always been supportive of that.. but sometimes I think I am being selfish and I want to quit in order to take care of my mom like she has taken care of me. But my mom encourages me to follow my dreams, despite what she has to sacrifice and her sufferings.. and I just wish I could be more than just a burden.  But even if I wasn't chosen, that is okay too. I will continue to work hard and make my momma proud. Thank you for taking the time to read this. And I hope you and everyone are staying safe and healthy. Thank you James for being an inspiration to many and it is always a pleasure to watch your videos. <3
Tbh, your kitchen is bigger than our house, not joking, not to mention we have no bathroom and our house is made of wood.
Oh my god round of applause most detailed house tour about to go watch the other one I’m gonna comment it’s the lawns as detailed as this :-)
Lol I watched part 2 first but this house must have costed like $20 million
Name: Samantha Conley Age: 19 (will be 20 October 5!) Location: DETROIT Michigan  instagram: sam_conley127 - If I was so lucky to win, I would use the money to pay off college as well as help me get a place of my own. I feel like I have ZERO chance of winning but it doesn’t hurt to try. 😌
Hi James💖 My name is Emily Rodriguez I am 18 years old I’m from Laredo, Texas. What I would do with the money is pay my college funds because working and going to college is a big hassle! Congrats on 20 mil you deserve it❤️
Hopefully you see my other comment with socials and I replied to my own comment in what I'd do with the money luv you xx
Guysssssss!! James is marshmallow listen to me!
Evelia Uc  15  Chicago, Illinois  Insta: @eveliaaa.uc  Why: I just want to start by saying that I dont want to win this for me but for my mom. Shes gone through so much and shes such a strong women. These past 2 years have been tough for us, we got our first apartment and its was very pricey for my mom to pay on her own so the owner helped us out by reducing the price. When we moved in we had no furniture for like 7 months. My mom had to work 2 jobs bc her first job wasnt paying her enough to pay the bills. She would work from 4am-11pm and she would barely eat or get any sleep. There was times I wouldnt eat or even get to see her bc she would be at work. She did this for a few months last year and this year again. She pays the bills and all my necessities. But I hate that she never goes shopping for herself. She never really spoils herself, she always buys her clothes from thrift stores and I'm not saying that's bad but I just wish she would at least spoil herself a bit more, you know. I cant help her in any other way since I cant work yet so I want to give this a shot, I've never won a giveaway but why not. Her birthday is coming up on september 15th and I feel like this would such a great opportunity for her to win this as her birthday gift. She could do so much with that like start her business shes been wanting to start, buy a car since we dont have one, buy herself more clothes/shoes, or payoff her debts. It would mean the world to me if we won. :(
with that money I will spend it at the university so as not to worry my parents so much for expenses
I’m 5 days late but here nonetheless 🤍
This house is gorgeous 🥺 love it
Not a James Charles watcher but I FREAKING LOVE HIS HOUSE

Name: Katie Nguyen Age: 18 Insta: katieeee_nguyen Hey james - first off i LOVE your house. I have always loved beautiful homes too ever since i was a little kid, and i have always dreamed of getting one in the future too. Hopefully one day i'll get there just like you <3. I want to use my money to help me pursue a career as a woman in stem. Recently, I have taken an interest in computer programming and building computers, which i understand is unusual for a girl to be interested in, but i want to be able to do it to prove to my future kids that girls can be good at anything they want to be good at. I will use the money for college and graduate school -- this will have such a big impact on my future that even if you read this and knew what my passion is, it would be such an honor :).
I adore you so much like you are my great inspiration to study and work harder to achieve great succes!

I would love to win because I have been stuck with huge amounts of my health care bills that I would love to reduce. I would also love to use the money to help with other things like my student loans and a down payment on a house as well as a car. I am attending school for business and finances and would love the money to help relieve some debt and stress also a nice laptop. I have been working towards these goals tremendously and it would mean the world to me to even be considered for this giveaway. However, if there is anyone one more deserving please give them the chance before me. Thank you for the opportunity your giving to your followers and these wonderful people who support you!

I remember watching your YouTube in 2017 before you released your palette and before you even hit 10 million subscribers. You were one of the first people I watched that inspired me so much that I actually went out and bought makeup and tried recreating some of your looks. Since then my love and passion for makeup has grown even more and so has my talent😉 I’m currently enrolled in an online program to become a certified makeup artist and if I were to win this giveaway I would use the money to be able to start my own business and hopefully one day make it my career. It’s always been my dream to be able to do what I love and earn money from it and $20,000 would be a great jump start to that dream. Hope you can see this and through my social media also see my passion😊 p.s. it would also be an awesome birthday present
Lily Bradley- Lewis 17 Atl, Ga First of all congrats sister I’ve been watching you for years and I have basically watched you grow into such a successful and amazing person, you should be so proud of yourself.

But James I wish you all the best in the world, and I I’m so excited to continue watching you grow ☺️

Name: Gabrielle Cronin  Age: 19 Location: Colorado Springs, CO  Why: I would use the $20,000 to help pay for my school loans. My parents are helping with some of my college expenses and I would love to be able to tell them they don’t have to worry about that expense especially since I have another sister at home. Not to mention my parents want to retire and they love and care for me too much to not help me as much as they can and I love them so much for it. To be able to tell them I can cover some expenses would mean the world.  Insta: gabriellecronin_  Love you the most!! Thank you!!❤️
Can we just appreciate how amazing James makeup and hair looks today
james's closet is as big as my master bedroom :')
Where’s the upstairs mirror from?! I meed
bRUh i literally say this house in a house show thingy were they were selling that for lots of money! :0 so i guess james charles is gonna buy it!
Name: Amaya Urbanek Age: 19 Location: Houston, TX Why: I would use the money to repay my grandparents for everything they have given me. I want to buy them a car considering they have had the same one since I was born, and instead of getting themselves a new car they got me one. They also pay for my college classes and books, which I know is fairly expensive. They have always supported me and put my needs before theirs and I would love to have the opportunity to show them what they have shown me!  THANK YOU and I LOVE the house!!
The patio outside of your bedroom is my favorite thing about your house🖤 Imagine reading books out there and just getting lost😍
Not a regular follower but first all who is that adorable puppy 💕 and your new house is amazing!
name: abigail bush  age: 19 place: carbondale illinois  insta; abs463  i would spend the money on paying college fines and getting into a university, i would buy a new place for me it would be my first time moving out, and helping my family!! we have a tough time sometimes and struggle at points
I would put a down payment on a one story house so my mom would have a home instead of just a room she lives in. she is in a wheelchair and a one story house would solve a lot of our problems. let me just say that you are truly an inspiration that anything is possible
i know that marble fireplace cost more than my life

My name is Izzy. My moms name is Katie and I am nominating her to enter this giveaway. She is absolutely the best, kindest mother and human I have ever met. She has been through so much. She just went through a divorce recently and she is putting all of her savings into getting a townhome by our school, so my siblings and I wont have to move schools. She has sacrificed EVERYTHING for us and out of anyone I know she would be so thankful for this, her birthday is coming up and this is the hardest time of her life and I really want to thank her, and I know she would use it in such a good way. She would pay rent, put it in savings, get some better furniture for when we move in, better decorations, and so so much more.I dont know if James Charles will ever ever see this, but it's worth a shot, it's worth a million shots. I would give anything for my mom to get a birthday present this big. I've never won a big giveaway like this,  but I have nothing to give her. And it's either this or an $30 Walmart air fryer. Please Please Please. I love yall so much and love yall either way, but it would mean the world. I follow James on all platforms, and am gonna get my mom to as well for this. Her Instagram is @katiebarkleyray My Instagram is @i.z.z.y.r.a.y   She is 37 and a mother to 4. Love you James, thanks for this awesome chance!
I love how his bathroom is bigger than my bedroom
i-  But where is Grayson's custom piano for him
Done
Name: Brian Age: 20 IG: briann.chann Congratulations on your new house James! I absolutely am in love with your new house and its features you’ve toured us on. My favorite part of it were the photos you personally took when you were younger, adding a nice aesthetic to your household. As a first-generation student, I have always encouraged myself to excel in my academics to impress none other than my parents. They came to America just for the sole reason to bring us children a better life, and I want to prove them that. Not everybody has the ability to start off right when beginning live in a different country, like my parents, so financial sacrifices were to be made. The opportunity to obtain the prize would mean the world to me, since I can then have the potential to pay off my student loans when I become a graduate student in school. Nonetheless, thank you for giving us viewers the opportunity to have this reward, and I wish the best of luck to everyone else! ☺️☺️
Awww the dog is the cutest
beautiful!

Hiiii sister! First off, the fact you’re giving away this amount of money is unreal. You’re an angel on this Earth. Second, I’m just popping in to tell you why I want to win this giveaway. I’m 20 and live in Miami, FL. Growing up, life was tough for the most part. my family was ALWAYS tight on money. With that being said, if I won I’d help my mom out. Maybe pay off her debt, idk where I’d start really. She’s 43 and has raised all 5 of us on her own with no help. I saw her struggle everyday but I never saw her give up. She truly deserves the world. This would be a dream + more 😭😭😭😭  twitter handle @kaymbp insta @0kaymb
Hi sister! My name is Charmaine, I am 32 (__eniamrahc__ on IG). ID I win this giveaway I will use it to take care of my son. I am a single mom and definitely have not been able to work. Finish my college  degree for business management as well.   I appreciate this chance. And good luck everyone.

Name: Angela Gentile Age: 21 Instagram: Angela_gentile TIK-Tok: Angelagentile99 Location: Boston MA  Hi Jame, I would first like to thank you for always spreading positivity and making me smile in really hard time. I also want to congratulate you for all of your hard work and dedication. You have positively affected millions of people all around the world which is extremely rewarding. You being such a young age and accomplishing so much already is truly amazing not to mention admirable. You have been a great role model and have shown me ways to better my makeup skills. Ever since a young girl I have always been intrigued with the beauty community and having someone to look up to like you is a blessing. You deserve all the hype in the world there is to give. If I were to win the 20,000 dollars, I would do a couple things with it. First, pay off some school bills second, help my mother financially and lastly get a breast reduction. Growing up It has always been a dream of mine to help my mother out with expenses because money was always a big worry. I want to work hard, get my masters degree and assist her as much as I’m able to. I have also struggled with body confidence my whole life which many girls also do. My appearance has caused me to blow off fun experiences because of my anxiety on the way i look. So as imaged it plays a negative role in my life. Anyways, even if I don’t win the 20 thousand, at least I’ll know I wrote a positive message to you for you to read and make you smile. People are harsh in the world and if I can possibly impact you in any way shape or form I would write millions of comments each day. XO love you James❤️💜💖

Name: Miranda  Age: 22 Instagram: @mirandamarieee_98 What I would do: Personally I would use the money for my skin care and wellness business, invest, buy a “new” used car as mine is nearing its end and I would put some money into my 4 year old sons bank account to help with his future. $20,000 would be life changing ❤️ congratulations on achieving your goals I have been watching you conquer your goals for years! God bless you 🙏🏽
Dam me wishing for a cyan channel bag and you showing off ur gorgeous house iconic
the things i would do if i had this house
"I do not cook" *me cries in storage space* 🥺
Name: Camila Mena Age :23 Location: Argentina Ig: camila_menaa First of all your house looks amazing! Congrats. What I would do with half of the money is give it to my parents, I wouldn’t be where i am today without their help and sacrifices. My parents left to the states when i was 3y/o to give my sister and I a better life. Everyone struggles Ofc but immigrant parents always struggle more, so it has always been a dream of mine to be able to give back to my parents for everything they’ve done and given to me, with the other half of the money I would put it in savings because since I’m currently in another country and hopefully will be able to go back to the states soon, it would be used for a apartment and a car. Maybe you won’t see this but it’s worth a shot ❤️ thank you
Name: Kimberly Topete Age: 14  Location: San Jose, California  Instagram @: kimbo.topete Why: How I would use 20,000 grand to start a business use is that I want to start making my own YouTube videos grand so I can start speaking out around the world and being able to make people feel comfortable in a safe community and just make sure that everyone enjoys the content that I create! Though for that to start I need to start making videos. And with those 20,000 grand I can start with equipment needed to create my dream safe community that I want people to be comfortable in! Of course I am quite young, but I want people to know that I wanna see a good change in this world and by creating another safe environment I believe I can grow into fundraising and also make more businesses such as clothing brands, adjustable to all shapes and sizes. I know this might have been a basic request but you have become a great inspiration for me and to whoever does get their dream, I say CONGRATS!!
Hello, my name is Jocelyne and i have 18, and I would love to win so I can continue paying for my studies.

Name: Jenna Blair  Age: 18  Location: Pennsylvania (but I am currently in Florida for college) Why: I am currently going to college at Florida State University for Behavioral Neuroscience. After completing my undergrad, I plan on attending medical school to (hopefully?) become a Neurologist. This money would literally be a LIFESAVER because I am going to fall apart with all the debt I am going to accumulate throughout the years. With that being said, I'd like to use this money towards my education so that I don't have to spend as many years paying it back. Thanksss :) Instagram: @jennaa.blairr
Hello, my name is Miguel Ángel Márquez Canela, I'm 22 years old and I live in Coahuila, Mexico, in a very small city called Acuña, the answer to why I would like to win those 20,000 is why really  It will help me for many things in personal and family matters, for example personally I would like to finish my studies since I could not finish it due to low resources, a few months ago he began to see On YouTube thanks to my sister as we don't know English very well (estoy con ayuda de un traductor y un amigo) The makeup in general caught my attention, I think it is a very beautiful way of expressing myself, in the family, there are many things and well, I'm not going to write them all but ufff I'm not going to finish I just hope and if I am lucky enough to win, I am not famous or recognized in social networks, I have friends who really appreciate me, these are my social networks IG: miguel.marquz01

Name: Jessica Bauman  Age: 22!  Location: New York, United States  Instagram 📸: jessie_mae1_   I never win these kinds of things, but I love ya so much so I figured why not try! Winning 20K would be sooo beyond helpful in chipping away at my college loan debt. Having one less bill to pay would mean a step closer to being financially independent so I can move out on my own, sorry mom love you but gotta blast! Even if I don’t win I appreciate that you give back to your community in any way you can❤️
Aliah Aguilar 19 Palm Springs, California Insta: aliahxaguilar Snap:aliahagui Twitter: aliahxagui  Tiktok: aliahaguilar0 I first would like to say thank you Charles for doing something like this that is so unimaginable and special for your followers! If I won 20k I would use it to pay for my college expenses, help my mom with her cars payments and finally get me and my mom our own place :”) Me and my mom have been living with my grandparents since I was born and at times it gets tough and unfortunately we don’t have enough money to get a place. My mother is such a hardworking person and makes sure I have everything I need. Now I want to do the same with her<33 It has been a dream of mine to give back to my mom :’))))
I want to be rich
Yes!
Name: Joanna Gomez Age: 23 Location: US, Nevada  Instagram: @pinkraditz Snapchat: @pinkromanz Twitter: @pinkraditz  Hi James! I remember the day your Senior picture went viral & the day you were the face for Covergirl! I'm so happy for everything you've accomplished, and can only hope I'd be as hardworking of a boss as you are.  If I had $20 thousand dollars, I'd buy a new car! My old toyota was too old & was just draining my pockets in repairs. So it's definitely time for a new one, possibly a newer better one 🙆🏽‍♀️.  Anyway, I wish you the best, your house is a dream. 💖💖💖
Why is James kitchen bigger then my whole house 🤔😂
James is such an inspiration and motivates me to make my dreams come true!
I got bullied cause i was talking about cause ur sooooo amaZing
Rachael Gregory 19 Speedway, Indiana  insta: rachaelgregory__ imMy boyfriend and i have already figured out how we are going to pay off our student loans, and that left us with little money to have for a house someday. We have been together for 4 years and by the time we graduate it will have been 8 years together and we are beyond excited to begin our lives together and $20,000 would be amazing to have for a down payment!
Hi James I need. To know how to buy merch
i actually follow him since the start, and im really proud of what he has achieved, i just love him so much
mashallah
the things i would do if i had a house that ginormous
My name is Ciara, I’m 21 and I’m from Ireland.   My @s are   @mcmullanciara on Twitter  @ciaramcm_ on Instagram @ciaramcm_ on Tiktok   If I had $20,000 dollars there are so many things I’d do but my number one thing would be that I have a friend living in the states and his living situation isn’t great, I would love more than anything to help him get on his feet by getting him a car to get to work since his last one broke down in the middle of the desert and never recovered! Secondly, my mammy is the most talented baker and it’s her dream to open a coffee shop selling her bakes but she’s too worried about the financial impact it could have quitting her job to pursue it. I would love to give her a little helping hand getting that set up. Finally, if there was anything left would absolutely love to either visit Italy or to hire an agent as I am dying to get into acting or musicals. It’s been my dream since I was like 4! 😂♥️
Your HOME IS INSANE 🙀😻 🔥
YOU & YOUR House ARE amazingly compatible

I literally turned green from envy watching this
Name: Paola solorio  Age: 22 Location: Anaheim, CA  Why: hey James congrats on 20million! Well deserved! 💅🏽 With the 20K I plan to save 10k for rent & just so my parents & I can take a break from the rent lol & use the $ we usually use for the rent for our bills & expenses. It would totally help a lot !! 🥺 ever since I was little we have struggled a lot financially & I’m glad I’m able to help my parents but sometimes it’s so hard to balance everything out bc I honestly don’t get paid enough & I have my own bills... which leads to not having enough to treat myself. But it’s ok as long I pay my stuff on time but honestly it would totally help! 💗 and with the other 10k I would buy myself a car ! I’ve been having a hard time saving for a down payment bc of all the bills I have but I know eventually I’ll get a car. I need a car for work & school, I usually take the bus or my sister is kind enough to take me. Thank you so much for this big giveaway. This is truly kind and I just wanna say congrats on that milestone! You deserve the world and so much more! Much love xoxo ❤️  Ig: pa.css Twitter: paxcss  TikTok: pa_cs Snapchat: I’m following you on sc lol but I won’t display that haha
Name: Blaine  Age: 21 Location: VA, USA.  Reason:  kicked out by my family for being bisexual. Struggling with getting by with phone bills / rent.  I would be eternally grateful and forever thankful for help getting by.  Thank you James for all that you do with your platform.
Anyone gonna talk about how cool his outfit is?
omg the house is so pretty!
Name: Megan Kelley Age: 25 Location: North Carolina Why: I’m hardworking and have earned everything I have. There’s so many things I want to do. If I were to win I would love to pay off my car, get started with school and save to be able to start a family. I work full time and try to be a good person. Receiving such a wonderful gift would be life changing and so rewarding.  Social: insta, TikTok, snap, Twitter, mmarie184
Your house is bigger than my brothers College
what wait if it rains with that patio?
Name: Melanie Anderson Location: Massachusetts Age: 23 Instagram: @melanieandersonn Why: I would use the $20,000 to start an adult services program for individuals with autism and intellectual disabilities. My brother is 22 and has autism. He is unable to speak and relies on my family for everything. Once he turned 22, he aged out of the public school system and my family was challenged with finding an adequate day program for him to attend. After touring many programs, we quickly realized that they all kind of suck. Due to a lack of funding, the individuals receive significantly fewer services than they did in school and lack access to meaningful experiences. Between my background as a special education teacher and a caregiver to someone with such profound needs, I have made it my goal to open my own day program for people like my brother. It will require a TON of fundraising and a lot of hard work, but I am determined to improve this failing system. If you would like to hear more about my goals for the program and my family's story, please reach out!! Thank you, James!!!
Name: Mariana Rodriguez Age: 19 Location: México. Why: i would love to start paying my, and my sister’s university.

I would be truly blessed to win this giveaway but even if I didn’t I’m still great fun for the life and people I do have and regardless I will still continue to work hard as a CNA and gather my funds for nursing school. 💙💙💙 thank you for simply having the opportunity to try for this giveaway even if I don’t win.

Name - Katerina Da Silva Age - 17(18 in September) Location - Virginia  Insta - katnissdiamxnd  What I would do with 20k -  Hey James!! It has always been a dream for me to live in Australia and start my live there. Unfortunately, in the US I’m not able to work due to my immigrant status, because of this I have never been able to make a life sustaining amount of money in order to pursue my Australian dreams. I would use the 20,000 to move my life to Australia, partially for plane tickets and the shipping of my belongings. I would use another part for building the house of my dreams, just like you it has always been a goal of mine to build the Pinterest board house I’ve always wanted. And most importantly I would use the money to pay for permanent residency and citizenship in Australia. I have followed your life journey since the beginning and you have been such an inspiration for me to continue trying to achieve my goals and dreams just like you did. It would mean the world to have you jumpstart my new life!  Congratulations on 21 Million!! You definitely deserve everything you have❤️💛💙
This is my chance to win :)

First I just want to say I am SO proud of you! You deserve this & everything good this world has to offer !! I love watching your videos & learning from you & your wisdom each video! Thank you for being unapologetically YOU, I admire it so much! anyways haha, I would really love to be given the money because my parents are struggling right now... I just want to take some stress off of them and give them a life they really deserve! They mean so much to me and I hate to see them struggle. I’m really worried about them. I also would like to use some to get a car.. just a small used one will do so they can get everything paid off they need to. But right now they can’t afford one and I really need one. I know I probably don’t have as much of a reason as others so if you do find someone else that needs it more than me.. please give it to them. I’d also love some more of your great & comfy clothesss ;) Thank you so much for even doing this. You’re so incredible James, really. Love you lots sister !! 💖💖💖

🤍✨ My name is Claudia Torres✨🤍 My Instagram: @Clawde.a I’m 19 years old and I currently live in Arizona and I just graduated high school. I was love to use the money for my education onto becoming a dental assistant.... it’s a start I want to help people feel confident and in their own smiles... It would really help me because my student loan doesn’t cover everything and I’ve been working two jobs at Target and Walmart which is stressful. Since I’m also Trying to save up money as well for a car. It’s really hard to save money when I have to lyft and take the bus to work or school because my parents aren’t willing to take me nor help me... so The money would be COMPLETELY HELPFUL and I would be honored and sooo appreciated if I earn this giveaway, but by the way congratulations. So proud of you!
Name-Golden Jenkins Instagram- blakk.spice Age-22 Location- Kenosha Wisconsin   If I won 100,000 dollars I’d take my kids into a safer neighborhood and buy myself some bras, because I haven’t brought any bras in literally two years. I’d also buy myself some makeup because the makeup I use now is from dollar tree lol 😂 and I live in Kenosha, so I would give back to my community because our downtown got ruined by violence and we lost a lot of business this past week.
Danielle Richardson  29  Denver, CO  IG @itsmedanninicole ; YouTube Danni Nicole  I would take this money and invest it in to my business, help my sister with the cost of her surgery, buy my mom an amazing birthday present, invest in a second property.

Hi I’m a fan ✨
Hey Sister my name is Rubi I’m 21 from Los Angeles Ca  what I would do with the 20,000 first of all, all of my family moved to Chicago Illinois due to how expensive the cost of living is here but my heart belongs to LA and I want to strive here, so I decided to take a chance and stay here, it was really hard to part ways from my family but I wanted to prove to myself that I am strong enough to figure it out and make my dreams come true. I’m currently living at a friends house But I know I cant stay here too long, so I would use to money to help me get back on my feet, I’ve had it pretty rough I live pay check to paycheck and my dog recently got surgery so I had a really high medical bill to pay... I’ve been trying to keep my head high and not give up because I know god has great things planned for me. I would use the money to start a lash business I want to go to school to do lash extensions as well, I currently don’t have any sort of transportation and I would also buy myself a little beater to get me by in the mean time. I would use that money to become a better woman and to invest into my future even if I don’t win the money I just want to say congratulations on your new house and on your success ! I’ve been watching you since the beginning and I’m so proud of how far you have come, you are truly an inspiration to me and I know how much you deserve this your tears and sweat are paying off sister, love you❤️ my ig is  new that’s why I don’t have as many followers but it is _rubiixo

-Denise Umana  -20 year's young  -Boston, Massachusetts  -insta: champagne.denixxe  -snapchat: Denise_umana   -I love how your home came out! I gained a lot of ideas and inspiration from this video. I am currently pursuing my diploma in Interior Design. My dream is to design homes, from how the exterior will look to the interior. I want to be able to sell, flip, renovate, but design, everything that comes with Homes. My biggest dream of all is to build my community up. Not just mine but around the country. I want to buy laundry mats, cinemas,  grocery stores, banks, clinics, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, I wanna be able to create a program that could help the poor/homeless find a job, a home, and educate them on how to manage money. I have so many ideas in my head that I want to execute. What I would do with 20k, I would use it for a down payment for my 1st renovated home. To start somewhere! To also invest in my education, to educated myself on how I can bring myself to that point. In conclusion my dream is to make a difference, bring peace in a world full of hatred.
James is at his highest and we can tell☺️✨💖
To be honest, James' entire house is literally a pinterest board.
Everyone thinks that James Charles fans are ALL Americans, like this if you're not American.
Name: Kaylie O’Bryant Age: 20 Location: Statesboro, Georgia  Use: I would use the 20,000 to stay home from my 40+ hour a week job and help my fiance from just having burn trauma surgery (3rd degree burn to his right hand) and finish our bills for the year so I could stay here instead of working to make sure he is taken care of. Sadly, he is going to be out of work for a long time. He has two more surgeries to get through. I would use it to finally be able to go back to school as well. Hope all is well. Hoping for a better future soon. Don’t know how much longer I can handle the stress of adulting. 🤷🏻‍♀️ IG:kaylieobryant Twitter: @obryantkaylie  Facebook: Kaylie O’Bryant Cashapp: $Ko02010

I would use the money to pay off my student loans!   Cindy _cindee_ 29
name: Macie McMahan age: 18  Lexington, North Carolina So my reason for want to win the 20k, would be to help pay off my college debt. I am currently going to school to be a school counselor, which i’m super excited about, but the college debt is not the exciting part. It would truly help me out in my future and be a blessing!!

I Love James and he is such a positive and friendly person and im so happy for this house 😍😍 but am i the only One that would never live in this house even IF it was free ? I mean it looks like a hotel ...like a mansion...too much space . And he is the only one living there . I would rather have a Little bit smaller house or appartement that feels like a house not a hotel . But maybe thats just me 😍😊🙏
Name: Emmi  Age: 21 Location: Texas IG handle: @emmirosejohnson I would use this money for a business goal. My husband and I have dreamed of purchasing homes to turn into rental homes. We hope to one day have enough rental homes so he can retire from his pest control business and have a passive income from the homes. This would be a huge push for us to start our dream of being landlords and providing for our future family! We’re having our first baby in March and are trying to make this goal a reality to provide for this baby who deserves the best childhood and life we can give them.  Having a passive rental home income would allow our future kids to have both parents at home with them and be raised by the both of us. ❤️
Jamie ward ✨ 22 Washington, United States  Instagram: jamieeejane  If I were to win I would use half of the money to finish renovating our home and make sure my husband gets the dream shop that he’s always wanted!! The other half of the money I would use for bills!! I cannot go back to school this fall because my husband got into an accident on a side by side and cannot return to work because he injured his arm, so I have been working as much as I can to make sure we have the money we need. If I were to win I could go to school and focus without being stressed out with work and bills. I am in pre nursing and have 4 more classes until I get to apply for the program!!!👩🏼‍🏫🏡👩🏼‍⚕️ Thank you for the opportunity James 😇🦋
Name: Ignacio Riveros Location: Viña del Mar, Chile 🇨🇱  Age: 18 If I was the winner, I would defenetly use the money to pay my future career, get some gifts for my family and friends and buy A LOT of make up. I've been watching your make up videos since 2017 but I actually never tried doing it because it takes a lot of stuff and I don't make my own money (yet)
HannaBrook Monaghan Instagram: @Hanna_Brook93 Age:27 Mississippi, U.S.  I would use $5,000 to work with a non profit on providing feminine products to women in need. This is something laid heavily on my heart for a time now and is VERY needed. $5,000 towards nonprofit called Crown Collective which focuses on creatively impacting communities and youth through the arts. Other half will be to invest in my craft of dance, currently I'm in MS only using online to train but with the help of finances I want to better my craft with training, opportunity and create content so I can inspire and help young adults and more girls in need. I've been working on these goals for years now and this money would give the me the push I need to achieve them and many more!
Coincidentally started watching this video
Yoooo James you should do a hide and seek video with special guests or friends :)

Name: Mindi Camara Age: 25 Location: Layton, Utah Reason: I am a stay at home mother of two beautiful boys (4 years old and 9 months old). My husband works in landscaping and works extremely hard in order for us to pay our bills and provide a life for our boys that they deserve. We just went through a long and expensive process of getting him American Citizenship and have had to build up a lot of debt because of this. He is trying to start his own company and does side work on the weekends to try to earn more money in order to do so but its hard for him because we dont have a truck, so he borrows my dads truck/friends truck when available. His work is more seasonal since there isnt any landscaping to do during the winter in utah because of the snow. So he tries to work long hours in the summer to have money saved up for when work cuts down in winter time. With the money we would love to be able to put a down payment on a house and be able to put some money towards him starting his own company. I would love this to help jumpstart our future!

James just called me poor in 10000 languages

Name: Thalia Vasquez  Age: 13 Location: Texas  Hi James,  I know I am very young but I really would do some big things with the money. With some of the money I would give it to my mom. My mom is a barber and hair stylist she’s worked so very hard to try and get a house for me and my siblings before we move with her. She has been trying for 2 years now to make this happen I would just like to help her a little bit. Another part of the money would go to my great grandpa, he has a huge house and lives alone. He wants to pay it off and get him a much smaller house or an apartment I would love to help him out. And the last bit of the money I would use for my Quince did Quince dress and decorations and fly out any of my family’s members that can’t afford to come to Texas. And lastly, I would give the rest of the money to the charity, Feeding America.
Name: minnie white  Âge: 16 Location: Brighton, England   If I had $/£ 20,000 I would put some into savings, get a golden retrieverrrrr cause I’ve always wanted one 🥺🥺 I would also pay for driving lessons when I turn 17 and buy a second hand car for my first ever car 🥳🥳 obviously I would buy your eyeshadow palette even tho I can’t do makeup because I’ve always wanted to learn :) and I’d give some to my brothersssss

Name: Betsy-lee Lopez Age: 16 Location: London  Why: I want go start off congratulating you on your house James, it’s a big achievement. Where do I start off? I simply just want to emphasis how much $20,000 would change my life- as I’m still young as much tempting it is to keep the $20,000 for myself I would give it to my mum. She has worked so hard my whole life to give me and my brother the stuff that we need, working 6 days a week for 12 hours sometimes more as a nanny to provide us with our necessities. Recently, something happened in my family that has affected my mum a lot and has left her with a lot of debt and I know she is struggling a lot. So $20,000 would change everything and I can finally thank her for everything she has done for our family. $20,000 would help us a lot and is exactly what we need and I know she would be ecstatic. Thank u so much 💖 Ig: betsylee.lopez

Alyssa Marshall 17 Illinois, United States Instagram: a.lynnmarshall Snapchat: heeyy.04 Twitter: a_marshall0403 Tiktok: a.lynnmarshall00 Facebook: Alyssa Marshall If I won the $20,000, I would use it 100% towards my cosmetology school, I want to go to Paul Mitchell beauty school fat from where I live and lately have been worrying about my expenses because I come from just a small town, where jobs are hard to get. I’m a Senior in High School and my dream has always been to do hair and makeup when I was older. I’m going to have to figure out the cost of living, money to put gas in my car to get to school everyday, and the amount of money i’m going to have to save up to be in the program. This would help me out so much, and you’ve always been such an inspiration to me. It will be my sign to never give up on my dreams no matter how far away they seem.
Coke cellar sent me

Beautiful home, congratulations 👏 ❤
Meagan Connolly  20 California, United States (the state my parents are in)  Instagram: palmerremy18  For most of my life I recognized the aspects of my physical appearance that made me look different from my peers, however; somehow I never really thought that there was anything wrong - on a deeper level, I mean. It wasn’t until last year when I visited a neurologist on a fluke recommendation from a cardiologist that I got some form of clarity on what made me look so... unique. I was diagnosed with an LMNA mutation that causes muscular dystrophy and lipodystrophy, two genetic conditions with serious long term health implications. For the first time ever I hated my body - I hated that I looked different - and it almost destroyed me. Even though I had begun taking care of myself physically - exercising, eating well, strength training - I was emotionally drained. It took months to pick myself back up; I even ended up dropping my full time job and just... escaping. I stayed in California for six weeks with my family, which helped a lot and eventually, with their support, I got myself back - I felt like me again, but this time... stronger. Once I was ready I started planning out what my future would have to look like; with two progressive conditions you have to prepare so that you can just... manage. The first thing I did was look into fertility. I knew that I would have trouble conceiving and after speaking to others with my conditions I learned just how much of a toll pregnancy would take on my body. But I thought, “I’m young and I’m being proactive so I have time to figure this out”. So I went to a fertility clinic and began that journey (you know the wonderful adventure of attempting to freeze your eggs at 20 years old while essentially single and financially limited). Now this is where the story gets a little upsetting: after some (extremely emotional) testing we discovered that I have a very, very low ovarian reserve. This means that I’ll likely experience infertility at a young age, which I’ll admit really sucks because I think I’d be a really great mum. Anyways, the treatments are extremely expensive and because I’m on a bit of a time crunch I don’t know if I’ll be able to afford them until I’m working, which could mean that I may only really be able to pay for them once I’m already infertile. I know this is quite the sob story, but I just... I am so used to having to fight for myself. I have fought and fought and fought and frankly this is one battle that I find more exhausting than any other. I know that being able to have children isn’t what makes a woman - I know that - but truly nothing else has ever broken me so hard as the realization that I may never be able to overcome this hurdle. I work really hard for my health and I promise that every time I’ve fallen, I’ve dug my way back up kicking and screaming... it’s just this time - just this one time - I want someone there to extend a hand and help me get back to my feet again.  (Second comment, because I’m having trouble with you YouTube comments!!! Sorry)
3:58: it me, a coke seller 👁👅👁
The layout reminds me of Jenna Marbles house... Love you James!!!! Sorry im late to the party!!  Work ALOT!!!
My entire room and closet would fit it his casual closet 😶
Hiiii sister! First off, the fact you’re giving away this amount of money is unreal. You’re an angel on this Earth. Second, I’m just popping in to tell you why I want to win this giveaway. I’m 20 and live in Miami, FL. Growing up, life was tough for the most part. my family was ALWAYS tight on money. With that being said, if I won I’d help my mom out. Maybe pay off her debt, idk where I’d start really. She’s 43 and has raised all 5 of us on her own with no help. I saw her struggle everyday but I never saw her give up. She truly deserves the world. This would be a dream + more 😭😭😭😭  twitter handle @kaymbp insta @0kaymb

Hiiii sister! First off, the fact you’re giving away this amount of money is unreal. You’re an angel on this Earth. Second, I’m just popping in to tell you why I want to win this giveaway. I’m 20 and live in Miami, FL. Growing up, life was tough for the most part. my family was ALWAYS tight on money. With that being said, if I won I’d help my mom out. She’s 43 and has raised all 5 of us on her own with no help. I saw her struggle everyday but I never saw her give up. She truly deserves the world. This would be a dream + more 😭😭😭😭  twitter handle @kaymbp Instagram handle @0kaymb

This is amazing!!  Btw. I love you so much. ❤️
Hi sister
My name is Ariana Fernanda Pacheco Villar and I currently live in Milan, Italy.  I just finished my studies and I would like to go to university but my mother does not have enough money to help me. So I have started to work taking care of an old woman with 18 years of age, because I want to grow and achieve all my goals. I do not know if you know but the price of the university is too high and well I am doing everything possible to be able to pay myself everything ,especially because I have 3 other sisters which my mother has to support and it is very difficult.  I hope you can see my message. You're really amazing 🙏🙏🙏

Your master bathroom is bigger than my bedroom and bathroom combined😍😍

Name: Ashlly Ivoshka Berrocal Sandoval Age: 18 years Location: Lima, Peru. Facebook: Ashlly Ivoshka Berrocal Sandoval Instagram: @ brigtwinn24 To begin with, congratulations on reaching 20M, this figure is the result of all the effort and skill you have, you are admirable; from Peru we wish you every success. ■ Well, those $ 20,000 that I would invest in my house, my parents have been raising money little by little and after 3 years of living in 2 rooms, being a family of 6, we were able to finish building our house (most of it), managed to paint most of it; however, a lot of money is still needed for roofing(for which you need S / 35,000 more or less), flooring, and exterior foundation. My family has many worries wondering how long it would take for us to raise more money to finish the house. I just want to take a load off my parents, with this raffle we would finish our house and pay the debts. Only that would be necessary for us. Our goal is our home, and if it is not now, I know that sooner or later it will be achieved, I know it. Congratulations again on 20M !! Hope luck is on my side. I have hope!

Name: Rebecca Lucero Age: 23 Location: Texas, United States Why: If I were to win $20,000 the first thing I’d do is go see my sister... I haven’t seen her in so long and before she moved across the country we used to be best friends. I would also pay off student loans and THEN go back to school to get my final degree in radiation therapy  I just recently graduated from college and then moved from New Mexico to be with my husband who’s in the military. We live in a small town and so it’s been hard for me to find a job... I struggle everyday with keeping a positive attitude but this has made me really want to go back to school ❤️❤️

Name:Diana Heuner Age:16 Location: New Jersey, United States  Insta: dianaheuner Snap: dianah014 TikTok: dianah014 Why: With $20,000, I would prepare for my future. I plan on going to college so I would use this money to help pay my student loans. I would probably look into making investments too. I hear those are pretty beneficial. To be completely honest, that's all I can think of right now. I never really thought about what I would do if I was given that much money. I would give some to charity, as well as gift all of my friends with cool things. I would obviously buy my parents and all of my siblings cool things too. I feel the need to make this longer but I can't think of anything else. Anywaysss... if I had $20,000, I would do a lot of cool things with it. 👍🏼😁👍🏼
Besttttttt♥️❤️💞❤️
I really like the theme of the house.  Just being aesthetic like makes it feel comfy and hygienic.
CAN YOU DO A TRYING TO LOOK LIKE A GUY FOR 24 HOURS

How do you get 1 million subs in four days xD
Imagine having Pinterest as your house
why is this house so BEAUTIFUL
name: valery dominguez  age: 18 location: texas, united states why: My mom has been struggling for years with trying to fix her legal status and everytime we try to go see lawyers we can never follow through because they are really expensive and i just started school so they put it off and make so many sacrifices for our family of 8. I am forever grateful for what they have provided me with up to this point but i would definitely give the money to my parents because i would rather them fix that situation because it’s scary thinking about losing your mom who has been nothing but a rock for my siblings and i. regardless of whether i get chosen or not you will still be helping so many and you inspire so many in such different and unique ways<3
Just curious, what do you do with the furniture in the patio when it rains?
Wow
Good on you. Hard work pays.

Hi James🤍 My name is Zara and I am 22 years old. I am married and have a 1 year old daughter. I got married early and well life happened now my husband and i work day and night to raise our little girl. I just began pharmacy school as my life long passion has been to pursue a career in healthcare and help those in need❤️ I love to guide people and be there for them, I believe just being kind can be enough sometimes. I want to use the promotion money ($20,000) towards my education because I am basically taking out loans right now for my education. This money can go towards my tuition and I can be $20,000 less in student loans in the future and I will be so very grateful for that🤍🤍🤍 I have always loved all your videos and when I’m not studying, I’m usually on YouTube watching your videos!! My Instagram handle is: zara.ali._   . I hope you read this❤️ you doing this for people is actually awesome!! Take care, James❤️
Name: Ashlly Ivoshka Berrocal Sandoval Age: 18 years Location: Lima, Peru. Facebook: Ashlly Ivoshka Berrocal Sandoval Instagram: @ brigtwinn24 To begin with, congratulations on reaching 20M, this figure is the result of all the effort and skill you have, you are admirable; from Peru we wish you every success. ■ Well, those $ 20,000 that I would invest in my house, my parents have been raising money little by little and after 3 years of living in 2 rooms, being a family of 6, we were able to finish building our house (most of it), managed to paint most of it; however, a lot of money is still needed for roofing(for which you need S / 35,000 more or less), flooring, and exterior foundation. My family has many worries wondering how long it would take for us to raise more money to finish the house. I just want to take a load off my parents, with this raffle we would finish our house and pay the debts. Only that would be necessary for us. Our goal is our home, and if it is not now, I know that sooner or later it will be achieved, I know it. Congratulations again on 20M !! Hope luck is on my side. I have hope!
Dang I want a house like this :/
Name: Kenzie Stevens Age: 17 Wisconsin, United States Instagram: kenziestevenss  Why:  if I were to win the $20,000 I would put it towards college.  Winning this would make me so much less stressed about life and how I’m gonna pay for college to be able to reach my goals.  I would also use this money to help out my family.  My mom had a stroke summer of 2018 and I feel like I havent done enough to help her and my family out.  Winning $20,000 would mean so much more to me than just receiving money.  It means making my dreams a reality.  Winning this has such a big meaning to me and I really hope that I will be able to make my dreams of going to college a reality
This is my dream home... but I’m broke! Lol gorgeous gorgeous house! 😍😍😍

Hi James I just saw your video and I'd like to win that money don't have Twitter I cannot follow you on that but I follow you on Tik Tok Instagram and YouTube I hit the Bell on your YouTube and the reason I liked to win the money is cuz first of all I love your videos and I watch them everyday the reason I like to have the money because me and my mom are really poor and we don't have a lot of money and that would really help us if we got the money we take half of it and then give the other half to charity so that would be really nice if I can have some of the money. My tik tok @ is @lj24fun my ig is Leighton Hill my snap is LJ Hill ljlj6583

Valentina Rivera 🦋  21 🍷  ATLANTA, GA United States! 🍑  Insta: Valrivera23 🌞  Hey James! First of all I love your videos have been subscribing since forever. It’s always been my mom, who has been cleaning houses for the past 21 years everyday (literally) and my older sister and I. We live in a one story apartment with one bedroom. I am praying that you please see this and help my family and I out. I am a college student right now. And if I won the $20,000 I would give it to my mom to help her with finances. We also all share one car together a 2007 Honda Civic which has no AC and the bumper is about to fall off. My mom is the sweetest person in the world she left her Country to provide my sister and I with a better future we love you James and thank you! ❤️
Congratulations on 21M Sisters! Your home is absolutely stunning! I would feel like I died and went to heaven waking up there every morning. It’s so nice to know how grateful you are to your followers. Wishing you continued success and many blessings. XOXO from Texas

My number one fav YouTuber
Hi James I’ve been following you on every platform for a while now except for Twitter because I’m not allowed to have it but I would love to have the money for my family. Because right now we don’t have a home and are living at my uncles house. And would love to have a home and have a working car. If you would like me to tell you more reasons please let me know. Your literally the best for doing this for people.
If I get this I will use it on shopping to review on my channel and grow my channel. Including channel, Gucci bag 🤗.  Age 30, IG: bbbeautifulAngel Location: Minnesota
Name: Stephanie Coates Age :31 Location: Connecticut  Insta: StephanieMCoates Reason: I am 24 weeks pregnant and we are trying to finish up renovations on our house. I am due in December so I would use the money to put towards renovations on the house. Or to help me get a new car since I’ve had mine for 11 years and it’s time for a new one.  Also I don’t have a ticktock so I can’t follow you on that 😬
I have been a sister for literally 3 years !😬😳🤩💕
my jaw literally dropped when i saw the master bathroom. also the whole house is absolutely gorgeous, i love the style of it
I’m sorry did I just hear $100k???
God is good. Jesus loves you. prayer changes things.
Allison 26 Albany, NY IG: allison_soltis   I would use this money to help pay off some debts for myself and my closest friends who have supported me through some challenging times. I want to give back to those who have provided for me. If able, I also want to save some money to put towards my plans to foster/adopt children in NYS foster care system. I already have worked with at risk youth in the state, and I am set on being a resource to as many children as possible. Having more financial backing would help make this more feasible for me.

Did anyone else notice that James still has his custom bags from ZHC.
James should do one of those tiktoks where it's the "everyone has that one cool part of their house that everyone loves" and he should just show off his entire house XD
Well, what I would do with the money, I would help my mom to build my house so that I no longer pay a rented room and I would buy basic necessities, I hope I can earn thanks James❤️❤️❤️❤️

Name: Michelle Clayton Age: 21  Instagram: michelleclayton3  Location: Yorkville, IL Reason: I would use the $20,000 to pay off my student loans. I graduate from the Northern Illinois University School of Nursing program in December 2021 and have a hefty amount of loans. I have been working in a nursing home as a CNA all throughout nursing school but it’s hard to work a ton and get a bunch of money saved while being a full time nursing student. Paying off my loans next year is already stressing me out and I would be ever so grateful for the help. ❤️
the house us so gorgeous and aesthetic I love it. James you deserve this house from all your hard work and everything you have dealt with. Love you james and never stop working hard

Makayla Norwell  Age: 17 (18 as of September 2nd)  Indiana, United States  Insta: Makayla_ann_5613  Snapchat: Mnorwell1  Facebook: Makayla Norwell  Twitter: Makaylanorwell1   How would I use the money?: For me this money would be an amazing thing because I’m in my senior year of high school and entering my Freshman year of college within the next year. This money would help to take some weight off of my parents when it comes to helping me pay for college. Something else this money could help me with is my move. I turn 18 on September 2 and have made the decision to move out of my parents house and into a house with my boyfriend and our dog! This money would help us with the renovations the house needs, rent for the next few months, and help us to give our dog his best life! The final thing I would want to use this money on is my brother and his girlfriend! They have recently found out that they are pregnant, and the money I would give them would help them begin to get things for the baby, and also help them pay for doctors appointments and their rent on their apartment. I do understand that there is a slim chance of me winning this money, but I am happy to be able to get the chance to even try for this. James you are an absolute inspiration to me! I’m not a makeup girl, but I like to see the joy you get out of making content for all of us, and I like that I’ve been able to see you build yourself up after someone has knocked you down and you always manage to come back a million times better! Thank you for taking the time to read all of this. It is greatly appreciated from this small town girl! Keep making your content and being you ❤️

The rest of the money is to invest into something or into real estate.

Hi
Howdy!  The name's Winter and I'm 19.  I'm in college atm, almost a sophomore and if I had any money I'd use it to start a better music channel.  I'm getting my degree in Music Technology and Production and have always wanted access to Logic but Mac stuff is expensive hehe.  But I'd foremost be humble and would probably use the rest to help my mom get approved for a loan to buy her first house.  I have so many scholarships that I earned in high school so I'd love to pay it forward.  I know that it's your goal to do the same thing with this giveaway and I know it will make the most incredible impact on someone who will be forever changed by it in the best way.  It means a lot to me that you've pushed through so much negativity and have continued to be yourself and make your content.  I've had my share of assholes trying to tear me down and I am proud to know you even if you never know me.  Love you sister.❤️
Name: Kayla Age: 23 Ig handle: kthlang Why: I would use the money to pay off most of my student Ioans from nursing school! It was a long hard journey and I am thankful to be done and now working as a nurse taking care of people! And I would use a small portion to give to my grandmother who has helped me with everything in my whole life. She came to america as a refugee escaping war in Laos with my grandfather. They both have helped me with everything I ever needed and sadly my grandfather has passed on but I would be so honored to be able to give her whatever she wants! Thank you so much James 😭😩

Literally house goals and AT 21 YEARS OLD GOALS
Maga
I'm so sad you didn't even dedicate a separate room saved for your parents, and you actually would just let them sleep in the guest room where all of your coming friends or colleagues at work have slept into already. I don't know I just don't like the thought of it knowing as you said that the house originally has a lot of rooms before you started the renovation.
this whole house is a dream, I gotta say the backyard is my absolute fav tho
I would honestly love to see Games with James come back ☺️
I LOVE YOUR KITCHEN!!!
Kaniz Saima IG: @kanizsaima287 Age: 17  With the 20,000, I would try to find a new home for my family. My family and I have been struggling to move for a while now due to various personal problems that arose. Currently, I am the only one working so the moving situation has gotten even Harder. This money would help a bunch with everything. Even if i do not win, thank you for thinking of doing this!
Searched up l.a homes to build in the sims. It says James bought a 1 million dollar *STARTER HOME*

Lovely Classy House. You have actual great taste.
Hi sister!  My name is Tiffany and I’m a 25 year old single mom to a handsome little boy! I would use the $20,000 to further my education in teaching so I can continue my career plan that I’ve had since I was 15. This money would allow me to be able to pay for tuition, books, and materials and ensure that I get the best learning experience to be able to share it with the little minds I will be teaching on day.
MAY PILIPINO BA DTO LIKE RHIS YOU ARE
I can't find my comment from the other day!! Did i delete it by mistake??🤔 Oh well, James Charles: Congrats on your new home sister!!!🤗 May loads and loads of blessings keep pouring your way my friend😇. You definitely deserve it. Now, for my info as requested... I am 39 years young, i have two beautiful daughters (Arianna (10) & Camille (7)) and a fiance (Loui). We live in New York. My little one LOVES makeup so she sits down with me to watch your videos FOR HOURS on end!!🤩 Her dream is to start uploading her own makeup tutorials on YouTube!!!😊 Our absolute favorite video of yours is your first Drag Transformation video!!!! What will i do with $20,000??? Well, the first thing i would do is travel to fix my teeth😁 since the treatment i need is very costly here and my insurance here doesn't cover it, and abroad is way more accessible moneywise.🤑 Once that's out of the way, i will keep my promise to my girls of taking them to Disney World before i leave this earth. That is what i will do with that money. Thank you so much Sister James for being so generous with your followers. I always keep souls like yours in my prayers😇. Good luck to everybody!!!!🤗🥰
Love your videos James
Hi! My Name is Shanelle White. I am 18 years old.  I am from Saint Paul Minnesota. My Instagram + tiktok handle is @shanellewhite, my twitter handle is @shanellelwhite.  Winning $20,000 to me would be an unthinkable gift that I would be truly grateful for. I am currently going into my freshman year of college and I am struggling to finish paying of my tuition. My household is very toxic and I’ve been dreaming about moving out for years. With the money I would be guaranteed to getting my first year of college paid off to finish my dream of working in social work. I also would be able to get my own place and escape my current living situation. James your hard work and dedication is something I strongly admire. I’ve been working since I was 15 and managed both my junior and senior year working 2 jobs while attending high school full time. To seeing your new house and your large success gives me something to look forward to and work even harder towards.
Beautiful
James got some taste yo
It’s an amazing house, so beautiful, and I love the decoration everything detail the only thing I change is the bench in your room, better looking and comfortable, but of course it’s your home, I dream to be a home designer and I always watch videos and even I have games about that, I love ur natural modern costal style 🥰😍👌🏻💕
Um woah😳
You deserve it so much james, you work so hard and we love you. Congratulations! ❤️❤️❤️
James would be a really great realtor
PISO MO PARA SA LAPTOP KO"  Hello everyone! I'm Kenn Paul Angelu Nalda, an incoming grade 12 STEM student at Valencia National High School. I've seen several post about this online campaign to support student para makabili ng gadget (laptop) na magagamit nila para sa online class.  Honestly nahihiya po talaga akong mag post ng ganto dahil alam ko naman pong marami sa atin ang may financial problem, pero gusto ko lang pong i-take ang time na ito na humingi ng koonting tulong mula sa inyo. Lingid po sa inyong kaalaman, na sira napo kasi yung laptop ko na pinamana lamang ng ate ko nong ginagamit ko pa eh dina gumagana kapag di chinacharge, Para po makabawas sa gastusin ni mama ay nag lakas loob na din po akong mag post ng ganto.  Sa mga willing at gusto pong tumulong, ito po ang aking Gcash account (09776830021), any amount po na idodonate niyo ay magiging malaking tulong sa pag bili ko ng laptop (kahit tablet or laptop lang) para lang sa zoom na magagamit ko po sa aking online class. Maraming salamat po and God bless y'all! ❤️
If you showed me this video and told me that James was a realtor and was selling this house I would believe you and think he’s a great realtor

Name: Zejneb Al-Aboudy Instagram: zejneb_a Age: 21 With the 20,000 I would use it to help me pay for my final year of college as a computer science major. Once I do that, the money would help me start investing in real estate!
Carolina Bossio  18  Miami, Florida Insta: business  page: @kuc_glam. main page: @lxnx_caro Why: the reason why I want to be the winner for the 20,000 dollars is because it’s Been a dream of mine to finally open up my online clothing store and nail supply store and salon. I want to invest this money in my business 100%. I pray you see this because it will drastically change my life and my entire family💕 I'm praying and manifesting that I win that 20,000 will really impact my life I've had such high hopes for my future ever since I was young and this money will truly impact in ways you wouldn't imagine. I'm going to start a YouTube channel for my nails soon as well to get more notice to form a fan base. All the money I make off of my nails I save for my future businesses so I truly hope you see this message
The setup is like...identical to jenna marbles. Must be neighbors
Honestly I would use that money to pay my bills and my debt. I would also be able to just breath... To not have to worry about looking at my bank account for a minute thinking if I can afford something as basic as Starbucks or to just enjoy something good in life besides barely scraping by and making ends meet. I can also use that money to finally invest in myself and become my own business owner than working a 9-5 minimum wage job. I want to be able to design my own beauty blender or clothing line or lash line one day.  Instagram: justmissnikkii  Colorado, USA  23
i love the theme of your house omg
Damn I wish I lived in this house I live in a 2 bedroom townhouse w 13 people 😂

Dana Fields  Location: New Jersey, U.S. Instagram: @dana.nicki TikTok: @dananicki Twitter: @dananicki  Hi James!   I am a 20 year old college student! And I am in school studying Television Production! I hope one day to move out to LA to create more content and build my brand/platform. I have looked up to you for a while now and you are such an inspiration! If given the opportunity to receive this generous prize, I would use the money to help my parents to pay for my college. They have done everything for me and are the best parents a girl could ask for. And I want to be able to relieve them of financial stress for my education. I know there are so many people that deserve this money as well. But I know in my heart I just had to take a chance and try! I know that one day when I get a bigger platform and have the opportunity to give back to people that support me, I will immediately jump at the chance to give back, just like you are. Thank you for this opportunity! And congratulations on your new home and hitting 20 million! 💕💕💕
proud of u james!!

Hi James🥺 I hope you see this❤️  Name: Destiny Warren Age: 20 Location: Auburn Alabama  I’m not sure how to start so I’ll just dive right in. My sister Haylee(17)  was living with my wonderful grandparents until their health problems kept advancing to the point where they were no longer able to take care of her. Both of our parents are not in our lives so my sisters only other option was to live with me. I am trying to put myself through college and hopefully become an amazing pediatric nurse one day, but sadly I can’t afford school right now because i had to get a bigger apartment and provide for my sister. I am working two jobs and don’t get home until 11pm every day therefore I don’t see Haylee that often. With the money, I would love to put my self through college and provide braces for my sister and I since we never got that opportunity. I would also love to be able to quit my second job so that I can be there for my sister and see her more often. I love you so much and if you see this I just want you to know that it would be an absolute blessing if you could help me go back to college and be able to financially support my sister the way she deserves. There is so much more to our story that I can’t put on here due to the extreme circumstances but I would love to share it with you❤️ love you sister!  xoxo  thank you for this opportunity

Hi James, I saw your vidio and decided yo participate(and who knows, maybe I'II be lucky 👍🤣) I think I wold spend the money on a trip to go to the U.S.A (because I'am from Argentina) and meet you and other people that I admire, ir maybe I can pay for my graduate trip or just buy myself hamburger right here on the corner 🤣, but I think it's just that. And I hope i'm lucky.

Name: Charisma Germeyer  Age: 15  Instagram: charisma.bre Ok first of wowowowow 20 million is so many people I remember watching you when you were working with cover girl which feels like years ago and it’s insane to see how much you’ve grown and I’m so proud secondly 20,000 is A LOT of money especially for someone my age but I have always loved makeup and playing with color and creativity, but I don’t have much to work with. 20,000 could be so much help in investing in new products and storage for all of them and I would also love to donate the money to my brother who has just started college and I’m sure it would be a great help to him and also charities. (Also my birthday is coming up hehe) anyway I’m so proud of you James and congratulations to all the winners.
Name: Karen Taylor Age: 23 $20,000?  Good day! James and James Team who are currently reviewing names for potential candidacy! My aspiration for the $20k is to use it wisely!   • YOUTUBE CAREER! Yes! I WANT TO BE A YOUTUBER!  •Equipment (its expensive so I will purchase whats priority right now) •Lighting, camera, lense and more! I want to invest this money career wise!   I have been working and saving up my coins. Little by little I have been purchasing for my set up! I think viseo production is very important and so I  want to also invest the money to better my YouTube graphic designs, animations like I want to be the best version of myself and help others feel beautiful through my videos!   I want to give back just how you are doing! Please invest in me!

Name: Brittany Hunter  Location: Kentucky Age: 29 Instagram: @brittanyhunteryo  Why: I'm in a rental situation with a terrible upstairs neighbor. I'm trying to save to buy a house so spending the money to move into another place doesn't make sense right now. I would use it for a down payment on a house.
My name is Mahala Davaris my age is 20 instagram @mahala.cj California USA  My life didnt start out easy I had a rough life as a child but my grandma has helped me get through it she has done so much for my family and she is helping me pay for school I would help her in so many ways if I were to win this give away but I would also pay for my education. I recently enrolled in a university and I am studying to become a game art and development designer it has always been a dream of mine to create something for the world to enjoy and to be apart of a video game industry is certainly a way to do it. I am paying my own money for my education and my goals and this would help me tremendously.  James you are a light on this earth and helping so many people with this opportunity it could definitely be a life changer to me and many other people who enter. We love you with all our heart <3

Kate Davison  18 Newcastle, England  Insta: Kate.dvsn  I would spend this 20,000 on my  8 months old who will be one at Xmas. I also have just rented my first home and get the keys in November.

Joycelin Hernandez 18🦋 Laredo, TX. Hiiii James!!💖 If I were to win the 20k, I would most likely pass out😂. In all seriousness, I would use it for my college tuition🤓🎓, My plan is to attend UT Austin and become an architect 🤗 but like ya girl is broke af 😅😅. Anywho...Thank you!!! Much appreciation and good luck everyone ✨
This house is beautiful! Way nicer than Shane’s & Jeffree’s mansions . Really like his style.
woowwwwwwwwwwwww great
everyone is talking abt how James deserves the role that he was given today and on how he grew successfully. The fact that it’s  amazing how he built a fandom and grew a business on his own. I’m so happy and inspired of how he grew to be a smart and talented influencer  to a successful businessman. Everyone’s so proud of you James! 🥰🥰 we love uu
LITERALMENTE SU BAÑO ES MAS GRANDE QUE MI CUARTO
I plan to use the money to get an art business going... the money would help with shipping, supplies, marketing, etc. It would change a lot as I would be able to excel and really make a business out of it, instead of trying to hook buyers every now and then. It would also help me to improve my artistic abilities and have the financial leeway needed. Thanks so much for the opportunity!  Jackson Brown @itsparity 14

Name: Taijae Bazile Age:19 Instagram,Twitter, and Tiktok: taijaebazilee Snapchat: taijaemahone Location: Renton, Washington  but I'm on vacation in New Orleans, Louisiana  Why:  If I were to win $20,000 I would save up for a new, and keep the rest in savings account or I would help give back to those impacted by Hurricane Laura. There are are a lot of things that I would do with but the main things would be saving up for something personal like a car, college, and help fix my grandparents house  and I would also help pay for my grandma's heart surgeries she has a robotic heard and uses a defibrillator for her heart in case of a emergency.
Love love love your new house!!!!
James is so fucking cool i would live to meet him who ever wins this money better believe in blessings cause that would be eye opening # blessed winner💖❤👌

Name: Luz Aldana.  Age: 23. Location: Mérida, Venezuela.  Hi James, well what could I do with 20 thousand dollars? where can i start? I live in Venezuela, I don't really know if you know the country and the situation we are going through as a nation, here we live in a dictatorship, we go hungry and other things, what I would do with 20 thousand dollars, would be to buy a house for my mother She is a mother of 5 children, I am the second to last and she has never had the opportunity to have her own house, and I much less, with that money she could buy her house and one for me, or she could invest in my dessert business, in which I am starting .. I wish you could read this and give me the opportunity to have a life, a life that unfortunately I cannot have by myself, I have worked since I was 13 years old but as I said, the country and the situation does not help !! My best wishes to you and blessings !! You are really amazing and I admire you !! IG: @mumariam  Thank you for making other people's dreams come true, just as you are making your dreams come true!! ♥️♥️

Name: Angela Gentile Age: 21 Instagram: Angela_gentile TIK-Tok: Angelagentile99 Location: Boston MA  Hi Jame, I would first like to thank you for always spreading positivity and making me smile in really hard time. I also want to congratulate you for all of your hard work and dedication. You have positively affected millions of people all around the world which is extremely rewarding. You being such a young age and accomplishing so much already is truly amazing not to mention admirable. You have been a great role model and have shown me ways to better my makeup skills. Ever since a young girl I have always been intrigued with the beauty community and having someone to look up to like you is a blessing. You deserve all the hype in the world there is to give. If I were to win the 20,000 dollars, I would do a couple things with it. First, pay off some school bills second, help my mother financially and lastly get a breast reduction. Growing up It has always been a dream of mine to help my mother out with expenses because money was always a big worry. I want to work hard, get my masters degree and assist her as much as I’m able to. I have also struggled with body confidence my whole life which many girls also do. My appearance has caused me to blow off fun experiences because of my anxiety on the way i look. So as imaged it plays a negative role in my life. Anyways, even if I don’t win the 20 thousand, at least I’ll know I wrote a positive message to you for you to read and make you smile. People are harsh in the world and if I can possibly impact you in any way shape or form I would write millions of comments each day. XO love you James❤️💜💖

Age: 22  Instagram: 1unseeking1  location : vermont   hey james, out of probably the million comments of people explaining their reasoning for being gifted your extreme generosity, where mine will most likely be lost, i would like to state my reasonings on why i deserve whatever gift you choose to gift me with.  with every life their is good times and bad times.  Currently my life is in a deep deep state right now. between depts in my life, family unable to work and take care of them self’s for having contracted coronavirus , family member lost  home due to the hurricane in louisiana. there’s a lot of negativity in my life right now. helping me would ease so much of the hardship and bring smiles to myself, and family’s faces. it would be so much more than a gift james. it would help my family’s life for the better and push us into the direction we need to be. love you sister.
I feel this is a nice house for James. It fits him and it’s not too big unlike other celebrity’s
can i move in lol
That looks like Rebecca zamolos house
I am sorry James for saying food things 😞
james "we DO DO a lot of snacking" *immediately realizes he said dodo and tries not to laugh* and that's on ACTING, king
so proud of you James, for making it this far and for working hard enough to get to this point! ❤️

I commented earlier but forgot to add some stuff and I can’t find my comment anymore so here we go again!  Name: Brande Lor Age: 25 Instagram: brandelor Location: Wisconsin Why: It’s been both mine and my boyfriend’s dream to get a house so our dog has her own space to run around. We have an almost 3 year old husky who is just full of life and energy! The place we are renting now does not have a fenced yard so I can’t let her go free otherwise she will run away. I just want her to have all the space to run around leash free with my supervision of course. I would also love to pay off some of my student debt!
Tabitha Grose 21 Chicago, Illinois  Insta: tabithagrose  What I would do: I would pay off my cosmetology school loans, and buy myself a car to be able to visit my mom regularly and get to work easier 💗 my dream is to be a master stylist and the money would take a big weight off my shoulders!  Love you James, and congrats to whoever wins 💗
Was his last home rented? It was also very nice with the black pieces. This one is more warm and homie though.
And that's my dream house 😌

name: jamie  age: 20  ig: @jamie.hannahh   SISTER JAMES!!! 🦋🦋🦋 first off, let me say that i’m SO happy for you & your first home purchase! that is such a big deal, and i can honestly say that you inspire me to continue to work hard towards my dreams, and to preserve through whatever the universe places in my path. 🥰   ever since i was really young, i knew i wanted to help people. i sometimes struggled with what i thought my life purpose would be, & i remember times being  so upset because i had NO IDEA what i was going to do with my life. it wasn’t until i got to college where i truly feel like i’ve started to blossom (going into junior year!!!), & realize  what i want to create & build before my time on earth is up...   i know this sounds cheesy af, but learning from influencers such as natalia benson, gala darling, the skinny confidential, and of course — yourself, have truly helped me IMMENSELY to recognize that i want to be my own boss & create a business / brand based around skincare, lifestyle, and all things wellness — helping people feel good + confident about themselves, & their lives as much as you've helped me.   not only do i want to help other people step into their power & start living their lives the way they’ve always dreamed of, i want to be able to donate to charities & organizations that help people around the world who are struggling (maybe even start my own charity one day hehehe) !!!! one of these issues which personally affects me on a daily basis is helping to raise money for research into an auto-immune, chronic illness called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).   JRA affects the joints as well as the entire body, & causes serious damage to the joints and eyes without proper treatment (which is obvi expensive AF). i was diagnosed with this incurable illness at the age of 3. i personally know the pain and struggle of this illness and how scary it is.   one of the reasons i want to start my own wellness brand is so that i can educate others on how important it is to take care of your body (esp with chronic illnesses such as JRA), & to most importantly, donate to research to find a cure one day, & to help those with this disease who cannot afford treatment.   i truly believe that with $20K i will be able to invest into the necessitates for starting a business. this would give me the extra funds required to get started. and it would mean the absolute WORLD to me.   thank you so so so so much james for deciding to do this giveaway!!! 🤍🦋🦋🤍🌞🌞
It is the dream come true Congratulations your struggle and effort everything is possible
Shakira Hunter insta shakirahunter I would buy my family the world with $20k I’m from mobile, Al and in college

Name: Angela Gentile Age: 21 Instagram: Angela_gentile TIK-Tok: Angelagentile99 Location: Boston MA  Hi Jame, I would first like to thank you for always spreading positivity and making me smile in really hard time. I also want to congratulate you for all of your hard work and dedication. You have positively affected millions of people all around the world which is extremely rewarding. You being such a young age and accomplishing so much already is truly amazing not to mention admirable. You have been a great role model and have shown me ways to better my makeup skills. Ever since a young girl I have always been intrigued with the beauty community and having someone to look up to like you is a blessing. You deserve all the hype in the world there is to give. If I were to win the 20,000 dollars, I would do a couple things with it. First, pay off some school bills second, help my mother financially and lastly get a breast reduction. Growing up It has always been a dream of mine to help my mother out with expenses because money was always a big worry. I want to work hard, get my masters degree and assist her as much as I’m able to. I have also struggled with body confidence my whole life which many girls also do. My appearance has caused me to blow off fun experiences because of my anxiety on the way i look. So as imaged it plays a negative role in my life. Anyways, even if I don’t win the 20 thousand, at least I’ll know I wrote a positive message to you for you to read and make you smile. People are harsh in the world and if I can possibly impact you in any way shape or form I would write millions of comments each day. XO love you James❤️💖
To be honest, James' entire house is literally a pinterest board.

Everyone thinks that James Charles fans are ALL Americans, like this if you're not American.
"Here's my wine cellar, I don't drink wine." "Heres's my office, I don't use an office." "Heres's my kitchen, I don't cook."

Name:Noah Miller Age:24 Instagram:luln0aah Location: Miami Florida Well.. if I were ever to win 20 grand, I would INVEST INVEST INVEST, in myself and especially for my YouTube channel, I’ve recently came to decision to make YouTube videos recently and I’ve been posting on my 2nd one so far, and I’m thinking about making this into my 2nd passion, I would definitely invest in great top of line camera equipment like yours probably not that’s much lol but a nice set up for great lighting and camera glimpses and MacBook computer so I can make amazing videos as well. Also along with the rest of the money I would like to pay my moms back for the hard times I’ve had with losing jobs since I graduated high school back in 14 of course I payed her back here and there but it wasn’t easy , these past few years were and still absolutely hard for me so I just want to give her money back for helping me out for the bad times also. I don’t live in the house anymore I live in the back house which was a small garage for our lawn equipment which we moved into the shack she purchased years ago, it’s kind of small so I maybe I was thinking if I had the money I’ll hire some renovators to help turn this place into a actual small house I can make a bedroom or kitchen and a living space to make it feel more like a home I know 20 grand isn’t a lot of money to move out on my own just yet because I live in Florida and rent here is literately 1200 to 1300 which completely out of my budget right now but if things change I can possibly put a down payment on a house and just go harder to make more money to pay rent but I’m just focusing on the small important steps for now and the I’ll make big steps once I have the money. I hope you read this and like I said before the house is stunning and my favorite part of your home is the sisters studio it’s so well put together omg 😻 but anyways thanks Charles 😁💜✨
Evreyone talking abt the house Me: Omg the dog is so cute🥺🤍🤍 Lol

Carmen Perdomo 18 Sc: Carmen_3754  Phone: 616-929-3754 Grand Rapids, Michigan   Why: six years ago a huge part of my family moved to Barcelona Spain, including my cousins who are twins. We where in the same grade, so growing up we where ALLWAYS together even in class and outside of school, I almost felt as tho we where triplets (I’m only a month older). Ever since they moved away for all these years I’ve had the same recurring dreams of going to Spain and having the best time with them, but then I wake up and it all goes away. I miss my family so much, but I would have to wait years to see them again one day. Why give me the money? Because you would QUITE LITERALLY make my dreams come true. (Of coarse i would wait for a safe time to travel and I would be safe and wear masks) I know this is a long shot but please consider choosing me James 💕 ily.

Name: Angela Gentile Age: 21 Instagram: Angela_gentile TIK-Tok: Angelagentile99 Location: Boston MA  Hi Jame, I would first like to thank you for always spreading positivity and making me smile in really hard time. I also want to congratulate you for all of your hard work and dedication. You have positively affected millions of people all around the world which is extremely rewarding. You being such a young age and accomplishing so much already is truly amazing not to mention admirable. You have been a great role model and have shown me ways to better my makeup skills. Ever since a young girl I have always been intrigued with the beauty community and having someone to look up to like you is a blessing. You deserve all the hype in the world there is to give. If I were to win the 20,000 dollars, I would do a couple things with it. First, pay off some school bills second, help my mother financially and lastly get a breast reduction. Growing up It has always been a dream of mine to help my mother out with expenses because money was always a big worry.

Whitney Pagano age:21 instagram: @whitneypagano location: connecticut I plan to use $20,000 to expand my jewelry business @whiteislandshop on instagram. I started this small business about two years ago with my own money. Making jewelry is something I love to do, but am only able to do it on the side as I work full & go to school as well. As for a personal goal, I would use $20,000 to help out my parents and pay for the rest of college (I am a senior), and hopefully grad school!

Deithrea K. 31 MAUI,HAWAII IG: deithrea_k Hi James, I love all your content! Such a positive influencer! Such a VIBE! What I would do with the money is just trying to make ends meet whole raising 3 Beautiful children!! I am currently out of work due to Hawaii having such a strict COVID19 laws. I work for a hotel and have been furloughed since March. Due to being furloughed I was unable to close on my first home purchase. Which lead to alot of depression and anxiety. Watching your videos have defi7helped me keep pushing and striving to keep going for my kids. I have currently been looking for jobs but it's been a challenge with the kids doing distant learning unable to find a babysitter that will be able to do distant learning with them as well. Just a struggle out here. Thank you for the positive VIBES!!

hi sister!!! hope I'm doing this right.... if I won this giveaway,I would use it to get myself a camera, laptop, lights, all the things I need to get started on YouTube. I am a 32 year old single mom of 2. I am in recovery, and have 7.5 years clean! I've rebuilt myself and my life. but one thing that has stood in the way of my life really taking off, is money. I pay my bills, my kids are fed well and taken care of always. I found a sense of self in makeup and YouTube. it has been a way for me to cope and find joy. I want to help people, I'm currently working towards being a drug counselor. but makeup is my passion. I want to join the 2 things. anyways, congratulations on 21 million! I could only dream of success on YouTube like that. my Instagram is @serenideehope. good luck everyone! fingers crossed!!

Name: Angela Gentile Age: 21 Instagram: Angela_gentile TIK-Tok: Angelagentile99 Location: Boston MA  Hi Jame, I would first like to thank you for always spreading positivity and making me smile in really hard time. I also want to congratulate you for all of your hard work and dedication. You have positively affected millions of people all around the world which is extremely rewarding. You being such a young age and accomplishing so much already is truly amazing not to mention admirable. You have been a great role model and have shown me ways to better my makeup skills. Ever since a young girl I have always been intrigued with the beauty community and having someone to look up to like you is a blessing. You deserve all the hype in the world there is to give. If I were to win the 20,000 dollars, I would do a couple things with it. First, pay off some school bills second, help my mother financially and lastly get a breast reduction. Growing up It has always been a dream of mine to help my mother out with expenses because money was always a big worry. I want to work hard, get my masters degree and assist her as much as I’m able to. I have also struggled with body confidence my whole life which many girls also do. My appearance has caused me to blow off fun experiences because of my anxiety on the way i look. So as imaged it plays a negative role in my life. Anyways, even if I don’t win the 20 thousand, at least I’ll know I wrote a positive message to you for you to read and make you smile. People are harsh in the world and if I can possibly impact you in any way shape or form I would write millions of comments each day. XO love you James❤️💖

Hi James!  My name is Melissa Age is 27 Charlotte, North Carolina  Instagram: missmelissaa2991 Facebook: MelissaBarbaraCalabrese  TikTok: melissabarbaraca  I do follow you on all your social media except Snapchat cause I don’t have it 😬  I just wanted to say how I came to follow you and it’s honestly because of how genuine of an influencer you really are. You’re someone I really hope my daughter looks up to as a celebrity to model after once she gets older. I followed you from the Ellen interview and honestly you’ve been so true to yourself since then and it’s something I value as a fan!   What I would do with the 20k is honestly gift a good portion of it to my sister to help her in having her dream wedding that she truly deserves...as well as hopefully fix my vehicle so I can’t get it running again so I can go back to Work! Single mom status lol   Again love you so much! I hope I have a good shot but it honestly could not deter me from being a fan of yours!   Here goes nothing! Love the house by the way, you’re a whole mood 😉

You’re so cute. I love your personality. Congratulations on your new dream home,  you’ve worked so hard and deserve all the blessings. You’ve already overcome a lot at such a young age, if you continue with this positive energy life will only get better. Please don’t let fame and fortune change you.

Jessica Perez  18  California, United States  Insta: jessicaloperez snap: jessicaaxq  TikTok: jessicaperezx Twitter: no Twitter :(   What I would do with the money if I win would be invest. The way you were able to buy a house at just the age of 21 is super impressive. Your hard work has payed off for sure. With this money I would continue going to school to further my education which would allow me a good job and maybe one day I could start a business. I would also give back to my family because they deserve it. Our family is growing and we need a new car so this money would be super helpful. This inspired me to invest in my future so that one day I’ll be able to buy my own house. It might not be at the young age of 21, but at least it will happen. I’ve always wanted to own a house and this video gave me hope that I will be able to one day.
Wait wait waitttt whattttt you and rebecca zamolo have a exact similar kitchen
Ok but the way James speaks it’s so calming and relaxing. What a beautiful home this is what hard work looks like ✨
Image him and skincarebyhyram!!!

Savannah Berumen , I’m 18 years old , I’m from Austin Texas and my Instagram is : @savannahberumen  I am the second oldest out of four children , and with my mom being a single parent college will be very expensive for us. I would use the $20,000 for college as I recently got accepted into fashion institute of technology in New York and being out of state I will have to pay a lot more money for tuition. The money would be a huge help in getting the education I need for my major , thanks a lot xx

Name: Gina McClure Age: 26 Location: Oak Park, MI IG: g.kei.m If I were to win the $20,000 I would immediately give half to my two amazing grandmothers who raised me. They’ve spent my entire life and most of their life savings taking care of me and getting custody of me. When I moved out at 18 I went to school and got my degrees to be able to give a little bit back to them, even though I can never repay them for all they’ve done for me. The rest of the money would go towards the down payment of purchasing a home. I always grew up wondering where I would live, and if my life would be stable as I got older. Purchasing my own home has been a lifelong dream of mine that I’ve been working towards, and winning this could really help me and my family.

We have the same taste in house decor😭♥️
Name: Lauren A Age: 22 Location: Denver, CO Instagram: @lauren_adler429  Winning the $20k would change my life. I have an 18 month old son, a full time job, I’m a college student, I just started a side hustle on Etsy selling stickers & decals (@ellemaydesigns1) to get some extra income, and I’m trying to obtain a more healthy lifestyle. After going on maternity leave, I found myself in a lot of debt. But that didn’t stop me from trying to find new goals. I am currently trying to save up to get a more reliable car for my family. Right now, my paychecks are going towards paying off my past debt. If I won the $20k, I’d be able to pay off my debt and focus on my goals of buying a new car and expanding my Etsy business across the US.   Thank you so much if you’ve read this far ♥️ love you, Sister James😍🥺🥰
This is how much money James Charles spent on his house | |
Name: Taylor L Age: 22 Location: Scranton, PA Why: Hi James! First and foremost I want to thank you so much for this opportunity. You’re such a kind and giving person and i admire that about you so much. I’ve been watching your videos for years and I just wanna say it’s amazing to see how far you’ve come and how much I love your content! Your videos always make my day and inspire me! I’m entering this contest because I am a young adult living on my own and trying to become a teacher. I currently teach preschool but I would love nothing more than to go back to school, get my bachelors degree and run my own classroom and change the lives of so many young kids that I would be teaching. Unfortunately, preschool teachers don’t have the greatest salary so it is so hard to save money to go back to school, especially since I’m living in a apartment on my own with many other bills. This would help me so much towards my dream and change my life! Thank you again for being such an amazing person! God bless you 🥰
Absolutely beautiful home James!.. Your decorators did a fabulous job! It’s crisp and clean and bright but very comfortable and “homey” at the same time. I feel like the use of so many natural wood tones, baskets and the ship lap make it very cozy. Well done all around. Just stunning!  After going thru so much not so long ago, I feel this is all a testament to staying focused, staying strong, persevering, being kind, making better decisions and you can always turn things around.  💪🏼👏🏼🙏🏼❤️ The song “look at me now” was running thru my head during the entire video 😏
y'all james worked his way to wealth and i think it's fine to show it off! i don't know much about how he is as a person but if you have money it's ok to flash it sometimes!
Hey James, My name is Brittany! I’m a 20 year old inspiring photographer. I would use the money to buy all new equipment so I can further my career. I love to take pictures of my community sports and events. Also of random things around where I live and go on trips. With all new gear it would be easier and helpful.

Name: Anisah k  Age 21  Location: Manchester  With 20,000 I can’t explain how much I could do with that amount. I’d start by giving about 10000 to my parents to help cover the house mortgage, they’ve done so much for me so to be able to help them with an amount like this would be so surreal I can’t put in words. With the remainder I would use it to getting my first car and also put it towards my student loan as I’m currently at university. it would immense help my current situation I’m not working and studying so this amount of money really and truly would go along way for me. Much love   Win or not I just want to say after watching your house tour I’m so happy that at just 21 you have accomplished as much as you have keep smashing it as you are 🥰💜❤️🧡💛💚💙

Monica Arango 20 Florida, United States  monica_arango44  If I had $20,000 I would definitely invest part of the money so it could grow into more that I could use for the future. I would invest it in either stock or real estate. With that, I would hope to pay off my student loans, give back to my parents who have done the absolute most for me to make sure I am MORE than okay, and make a dent in my payment for my first house since I am about to graduate!!!  The house is beyond gorgeous! Love the renovations, interior design, and the style of choice. The house definitely shows a more mature and long term vibe.

Chanelle Garrett 21 Mesa, Arizona  I would use the money to pay back my mom. She’s always been so generous and helped me so much even though she’s never really had any money. Ever since I was 11 it’s just been her, my sisters and I. She worked so hard and went to nursing school while working and taking us to school. She deserves to be treated the way she helped all of us all these years. She’s always spent every penny on us to make sure we could always wear the clothes everyone else does and I want to be able to do that for her and give her something special.

I’m also in college getting into business so I can use the money for a jump start for when I start something of my own in the future. My birthday is also coming up, it’s the 1st of September so this would also be such a great birthday present.
love it!

What I would do with that amount would be to become independent by starting a business where I would sell beauty products.
He has my dream house
Name: Kimberly  Location: California  Age:20  Why: It would be a fantastic opportunity to be able to win that money for my parents and I. My parents have been working so hard for my sisters and I since day one and haven’t stopped ever since they came to the United States in search for a better future. Of course, I want to give them the world, but with our financial situation, that is something I would have to wait on. But with this money, it can help me get a jumpstart in my career and be able to invest it and give back to my parents but also help the community with my investment for my career✨
Wow so beautiful  house sis

kelli ohl  16  pennsylvania  kelliohl  i would give the money to my mom so she can get a new car finally. and the rest of the money would go to either anything associated with black lives matter and/ or the trans community.
James literally is matching his whole house 😫 such a professional mature style🥰🥰 Im obsessed
💞💞💞💞💞💞
I love and appreciate how he gave shoutouts to the companies that helped make his house how it is. Some people just ignore that and pretend they did everything
Name: Cheyenne Rose Young Age: 18 Location: Norfolk, Virginia Why: I will start my "why" portion with some background information about myself. I work part-time as a hostess while also doing school full time. I currently attend Tidewater Community College majoring in Forensic Science. I live at my best friend's house because I know my mother can't afford another person during these hard times. My biggest struggle for the past few years has been trying to attain a car. Now that I pay rent and can only work part-time due to college, I only make enough to get by. I would use some of the $20,000  to buy a reliable car so I can go to campus when needed and back and forth to work rather than spending so much money on ubers. This would help me beyond anything. It would mean I can finally get a hold of my life and make getting my degree 1000 times easier. I would donate the rest of the $20,000 to the UNICEF organization. It is a charity that revolves around stopping all child trafficking. I truly believe this is a big problem in the world that needs some light shown on it. I think if I were to win, James Charles's audience would see this and hopefully donate as well. Love you James! Keep doing your best buddy. instagram: yocheyenne
bless james charles🥺🥺
Name:Sabrina Age:25 Location:Houston,Tx Why? Well if i win the $20,000 I will buy my mom a better car because the one she has is very old and needs alot of repairs . With the rest of the money i will save it to buy a house for my son and I . I am a single mother of a 6 year old and this $20,000 will help us , i really want to see my mom smile and my son happy whenever we get out own house !!. Thank you James !!! Insta:bubbles_2013
what happens to the patio when it rains
Alexis Carrillo  Instagram: Alexis_auchaaa 20 (21 Oct 12)  Florida, United States  $20,000 is A LOT of money. And to be completely honest I would do A LOT. First I’d help get my mom started on her surgery I know 20,000 isn’t going to pay for it but it will definitely get her started so we know what exactly is wrong and why she is having so many problems physically. Second I’d get myself a car. I have been on and off of so many jobs because I’ve been kick out twice and I’ve had to move around like 3-4 times. And I’m honestly so tired of taking Uber asking a friend or even walking. And lastly I would use it to start up my embroidery site. I want to start embroidering because makeup nails and hair really isn’t me but taking time out to make things for other is and I feel like it’s a good side hustle to build my money instead of spending it. Once I start making them I can build my website and all on more items like resin art such as cup holders key chains and other small hand made items. Thank you for the opportunity and CONGRATULATIONS on the 20 million subscribers!!! You definitely deserved it ! 🏳️‍🌈💙😌 So proud on how far you’ve come even with the rough patches and SOOOO proud on how the house came out. It is definitely a YOU HOME 🤞🏼💕
Name : SHAFIq ROSLAN Age :18 Location:malaysia If i won this contest i would like to give all of the money to my beloved mother as she had raise me up for all of this while i know that her sacrifice would not equal to this money but i belive that she will be happy of this and i jope that sje will always be with me no matter what happen

James plz do a gamming chennel
Name: Abigail Rose Age: 19 If I were to win $20,000, I would put the money towards my education. My dream is to one day be accepted into a M.D./PhD program, a 7-8 year long program that trains you to become a physician-scientist (a career that combines the knowledge of clinical work as a physician and research). Being a part of this program will allow me to pursue my dream of researching how certain elements of plants can be used as an effective antiviral. I hope to one day make an impactful medical discovery. In order to do that I will unfortunately go into a lot of debt and $20,000 would help ease some of that debt, so that I can focus on my dream.
I would spend the money on getting my family a home to live in and computers or tablets for homeschooling for my kids twins boy an girl that are 10 and the baby girl is 8yrs old and I'm 31yrs so I pray that we could win this contest . That would be a Blessing SISTER'S
I would love to have the reward but I don’t want to give my personal information out to the world cause everyone can see it😔💛✨
Alicia Urista 25 Texas, United States  Instagram: urista.a Tiktok: Uri.Ali   and if I had 20,000 I would focus on school! I’m a full time college student and also work full time at my town’s hospital. I’m applying to the radiology program and I know it’s going to require so much focus it would be nice to be financially stable throughout these next couple of years with all my bills paying paid up to date.  🤞🏼

The closest look like Rebecca Zomolo house
Name: Margarita Isabel Age:43 Reason: the reason why i would like to earn those 20 thousand dollars is to help My mother-in-law; she has cirrhosis disease, and suffers every day with the pains in her body, my children and i are hurt to see her suffering, unfortunately the treatments are very expensive and the pills we give her no longer have as much effect on her, with the money we could take  her to good doctors and have them help us heal her, my mother-in-law is a wonderful person, since she was young she had to working and getting ahead has helped me a lot, and now i would like with all my heart  to be able to help her. Thank You very much for your great gesture, God bless You and give You much more. Instagram: margaritaisabel445
Games with James yes yes yes 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿💯
Name: Nadja Kallis Age: 18 Location: Germany (Baden-Württemberg) Insta: drawings.by.nadja Twitter: Nadja_Fungu Snapchat: ghostplayerin Tiktok: nadja_fungu  Hey James, I know there are many people who need this money just as much, probably even more, but why miss the opportunity to have a chance 🤷🏼‍♀️. So I’m finished with high school since July and I am now applying for university to study film directing. Becoming a movie director is my biggest dream. We don’t have that much money and having this gift would really help me a lot. Also I dream of going to an American university (USC/SCA....) but that is way beyond our financial possibilities. And though I will most likely not be able to afford it anyway, I won’t lose hope. Maybe a scholarship and this gift combined could do it? I’ll see and hope 😊 Either way thank you for this incredible gift to us, whoever may be blessed with it! Love, Nadja
Coke Cellar??? Hmmmmmm 🤔 ☁️sounds interesting lol
Sarah Taylor  26 Saint Augustine, FL @mrssarahtay I would use it to pay off my debt and finally move out of my parents house with my husband and two babies. 💛
Name: Paris Griffith Age: 19 Location: Nashville, TN Why: I am currently attending college completely on student loans while working three jobs to pay rent. My mom is trying to develop her small business while also raising me and my two sisters on her own, so I would do anything just to give back to her for doing everything she can to put my sisters and I through college!
Hi James! My name is Alayna and I live in Wisconsin. I am 18 years old and would use the $20,000 to help me with college payment, but also look into entrepreneurship.  Since I was a little girl, I’ve been in love with architecture and the environment.  If I don’t use the money to help myself grow, I would definitely donate a lot of it to organizations that help reduce the climate change problem.  There are probably millions of entries and if you happen to read mine, hi.  When I was in middle school, I suffered from depression and anxiety.  I am not at all using that for a better chance to win because I’m pretty sure everybody has suffered from depression and/or anxiety at some point in their life. I am one of the lucky ones who escaped the enclosing darkness and I would like to thank you for helping me through that. You might not know how much you have impacted everyone’s life, but you have. You are so selfless and caring towards everyone.  You’ve made me become a more independent and confident woman’s and I can’t thank you enough for that.  Alayna Rineck 18 Wisconsin, USA instagram: alayna.rineck snapchat: lany_r twitter: don’t have one, I try and avoid as much social media toxicity as I can

Name: Raimi Hercules Instagram: raimi.hercules Twitter: @HerculesRaimi Age: 19 Location: Arizona, United States Reason: With the $20,000 I would distribute the money & put it towards starting up my business idea I've had written down for a while. Not only that but I would be putting it towards schooling for business as well. Lastly, it would be used to help get me my own place & give back to my parents a little bit
Nu intende nada plis Brasil 🇧🇷
He’s come so far
Your house is stunningly gorgeous James x
Name: Autumn (Audi)  Age:19  Location: Lock Haven Pennsylvania  Why: Hi James!:) Im a mom of two little boys. Mason is 3 and Legend is 2. My boyfriend and i try to do all that we can as parents. I work full time while he stays home week days and on weekends he works. Ive been trying to save money to buy a car but it seemz everytime i start saving something goes wrong with my grams car (she lets me use it for work) and i have to fix it. I would use the money to buy a car, and a home. Having our own house would help us in so many ways. We could cut our cost of living down. We wouldnt have to worry for the rest of our lives and we wouldnt have to live in low income housing. Its hard doing so much work and seeing nothing from it. Ive stuggled to get where i am now. Its still hard but with 100,000 i could give my kids a better life. As a mother thats all i want is for them to not have to worry about a place to sleep at night.. if we had a house i could go to college and go to cosmetology school. Having a house would just make my kids life my own and my boyfriends 10000000 times better.
Name: Steven Abad Age: 18 Location: Nevada, United States Instagram: steven__abad Why: 20,000 dollars is so much money I could buy 20,000 dollar cheeseburger from A fast food chain and call it a day. It’s incredible to give someone the opportunity to change the way their living and I have a chance as well. I know that as I start growing older, my parents are as well and they won’t be able to support my sister or me as much as they want too. I want to step up my game and begin to start my own business in something. Reason being is that I could follow everyone, go to college, succeed in what I choose at school, work 8-10 hour shifts every 5 out of 7 days and live check to check or I can be my own person, and have my own schedules, create amazing products for everyone to use and be able to show the world what I’m capable of. Even without the 20,000 dollars I would try either way because it can change my parents/my life in the end, but having 20,000 would give me a stronger chance to succeed and to give back to my family for how hard they work and everything they did for me. Thanks for giving us a chance to win something that could change our lives.
Jimena Valz  24 Florida, United States  Insta: alwaysJime  My family and I came from South America. Like many immigrant stories my family came here for a greater chance for our family to succeed. My brother and I have always tried to make our parents proud and make sure their sacrifices were made in vain. I’m trying to graduate with my bachelors but unfortunately all of my savings are gone and I can’t afford my last two semesters in University. The $20,000 will help me to pay off the last two semesters I need.  I really want to make my mom proud and show her I was able to get an education in America! I have applied to all the scholarships that I can and also took out student loans to help me on my journey. I really don’t want to give up but I’m struggling financially. Any aid will help me tremendously. Thank you James!
Contrasts what a classy home
Thank you for doing a house tour of the home of my dreams 😩😍

❤️❤️
🤍✨ My name is Claudia Torres✨🤍 My Instagram: @Clawde.a I’m 19 years old and I currently live in Arizona and I just graduated high school. I was love to use the money for my education onto becoming a dental assistant.... it’s a start I want to help people feel confident and in their own smiles... It would really help me because my student loan doesn’t cover everything and I’ve been working two jobs at Target and Walmart which is stressful. Since I’m also Trying to save up money as well for a car. It’s really hard to save money when I have to lyft and take the bus to work or school because my parents aren’t willing to take me nor help me... so The money would be COMPLETELY HELPFUL and I would be honored and sooo appreciated if I earn this giveaway, but by the way congratulations. So proud of you!

Name: Alexis Obrochta Age: 48 Location: Kouts, IN US Instagram: alexisdoneright  I am currently making some major life changes, going through major transformations, finally believing in myself to follow my life path.  Including dissolving a 30 year bond of restriction.  I plan to use all the lessons I've learned and healed from to help others that are/were in my predicament.  There are aspects of all of it that I was unaware of and I didn't believe help was out there for me.  I want anyone who needs it to have access to it.  That money would go a long way in helping me help others. I also want to treat my kids to some things they never had with some of it.  Thank you for who you are and being authentically, unapologetically you. You are an inspiration to many!
Wow this house is so beautiful! I’m happy for you.
Name:Ellie Age: 17 Location: South of England Socials (ig, TikTok & Twitter) - @_ellieosborne  Hi James!! Thank you so much for the opportunity to win this giveaway, the money would be life changing for me and my family. I would use it to help my mum pay the bills for our house and re do some of the rooms as we have had all the same furniture and layout for 17 years due to not being able to afford to get anything new fitted as my mum fell ill a few years ago and lost her job not being in good condition to work. (Essentials including our fridge, washing machine, shower etc really need to be replaced as they are starting to break😫) The money would also be so beneficial into helping me to go to film school to get my dream job which is working behind the scenes of films/shows, and I could get some photography equipment as photography is one of my passions and I’m currently studying this at A level. ❤️
i love this sooo much!!

Hey James! My name is Mallory, I’m 19 years old and last year I got into a really bad car accident with my cousin.. I accidentally ran thru a stop sign and got hit by a John Deere field sprayer. Luckily we are both doing okay but I ended up losing my license for awhile and totaling my car. If I won the $20,000 I would buy a new car and help pay some of my cousins medical bills and it would also be such a huge help to my online boutique I’m hoping to start in the next few months. Love you the absolute most 🤍 Insta: mallorypflum7 Twitter: mallorypflum Snap: mal.pal7  Tiktok: mal.pal7 Congrats on 20 million!!! You deserve it

Aracely Cervantes 12 Connecticut, United States Insta: aracely_cm Tiktok: aracely_cm_ Obviously you may think that I am very young, but I would use $ 20,000 more than everything to help my family, since as we have just started living in the USA, we have not fully adapted yet, obviously I would give the money to my parents and Let them handle it, I would feel very good having been able to use that money to help my relatives, but I would also save for my studies and my sisters in the future. Maybe you may think that it is not a very logical reason, and I understand that there are people who do not need more, and hopefully they will get it. I would be absolutely grateful.

name: Christine Williams  Location: USA, Maine Why: my grandmother just went through a lot of surgerys and now there in debt, I would help my bestfriend who can't support themselves anymore because of her brother who got a bacterial infection and sense I go to a private school she can no longer support going to the school financially and it would help her go.

I may not have very much going on with me but it would mean so so so much if I could help with everything going on in others life.  Thank you James

GAMES WITH JAMES GAMES WITH JAMES PLEASEEEEEEE
Name: Evan Kirksey Age: 21 Location: Missouri, United States Why: As an individual born with mild Cerebral Palsy, I have spent my entire life striving to prove that disabilities don’t define individuals as humans or in terms of success. Throughout my life so far, I have developed a love for public speaking and advocacy. Because of this, my ultimate goal is to become a motivational speaker. If I were to be blessed with this money, part of it would go toward beginning a career there. More importantly, however, I launched a campaign last school year called “Plan, Prepare, Protect” which advocates to protect special needs students in school shootings. Since columbine, there is a long-standing history of special needs students losing their lives in school shootings, primarily because there weren’t enough plans in place to protect them. A majority of the money would go toward helping schools craft individualized emergency and lockdown plans, to ensure that ALL students are safe & planned for during emergencies. No matter what, thank you so much for giving back like this. This is really wonderful. My family has always had to work really hard. I would love a little boost to set us up for the future. ❤️ Instagram: @evankirksey

Jeannie Lozowski 22 Philadelphia, PA instagram: @justjeanniemarie Hi James! My name is Jeannie and I am a current nursing masters student at the University of Pennsylvania. I grew up playing tennis competitively and was even able to compete as a Division One athlete until I sustained a serious wrist injury, which unfortunately ended my career. Giving up a sport that meant so much to me was heartbreaking, but it made me focus more on my passion of helping and serving others. I was able to work with the nonprofit organizations: "Love Serving Autism" and "Aceing Autism" which teaches and connects individuals with autism through tennis programs. The game of tennis has made such a positive influence on their lives by providing them an outlet to be active, form friendships, and even have fun. These organizations have been such a big influence on my life as well as it shaped my passion to serve individuals with autism and led me to pursue nursing as a career. I am currently at the nations #1 Ivy League Nursing school in the country which will help me to become one of the nations top Nurse Practitioners specialized in advancing care for individuals with autism. If I were to win the $20,000, I would pay off some of my loans from attending school as well as open up my own clinic and non-profit that treats autistic individuals. It is my ultimate goal to advance research behind autism and combine my passion of tennis and healthcare to improve the lives of individuals that face various autism spectrum disorders. I really hope that you will consider me for this giveaway and thank you for inspiring me daily :)  -Jeannie
I can't believe that this is even a 'house'.

Kelly Coleman 17 (18 on oct 25) Pennsylvania, United States IG & TikTok: kelly.1025 SC: kellbell_rox   (i don't have a twitter)  My goal is to major in Chemistry and minor in Fine Arts and hopefully become an art conservator/restorer. It has always been a dream of mine to bring an artists' work back to what they originally wanted it to look like. I also had dreams of opening my own personal business for restoring/framing maybe even receiving art commissions ! ! To create is what makes me happiest. I'd use this money to direct towards art supplies and books, and ofc, a manicure in between because my nails look BUSTED right now. To be able to put away money and not have to worry about finances too heavily during college is a dream come true for most, and to even be considered to receive this financial help is an honor. Thank you James for your time and sparkle :)
James:we’ve been renovating since November 2019 Me: I moved into my house more than one year ago and we’ve only done downstairs and my room and three bathrooms
name: libni salazar location: usa MD  WHY: To pay bills 😣😣😣
Name:Jerome Location:Las Vegas  Age: 19 Instagram: talekbills What would I do with the money: Growing up I was told college was the way to go but once getting there I realized it wasn’t for me. So I left while my family wasn’t the happiest I knew I what was doing was for me. Once out I got a few jobs but I quickly found out that that also wasn’t for me and I wanted to become a business owner. I didn’t like working for others who didn’t care for me and have my own business that I can use to help people. I already know my business will pop and my plan is not to just sit there rich with millions but help communities in anyway I can. The quick and simple answer I would put the money into my clothing brand. Regardless if I get the money people will know my name and the message I have attached to it.
Name: Janela Arauco Age: 18 Location: Perú Instagram: jane_31_ Twitter: @janelaarauco Why: I'm student in a university, but it is so far, 8 hours to my house and I need money to pay a apartament or a room, and for the university, because isn't public, and it's so expensive. My mother is a teacher and in Perú they are the worst paid. So, If I win that money, I use it for finally my studies and heló my mother to pay it.

Name: Ally Boyle  Location: Southold, NY I am 19 years old and living at home with my single mom. I aspire to be a writer, poet and creator one day, and hope to share my thoughts with the world. Right now I am attending community college online and working as well, trying to save up as much money as I can so I can transfer in two years and go to a school where I can finish getting my degree in English Humanities. I took a gap year to figure out what I wanted to do, and now I have my goals set on working extremely hard in my studies and hopefully publishing a collection of my writing within 5 years. This money would help me so much as I don’t have considerable financial support at home and I could use it for school and being able to start a decent blog with equipment where I can share my writings. I thank you James for your generosity. Best of luck everyone!  Instagram: aboyle4

Name: Adela  Age: 19 Location: California  Instagram: @adelajrrz Hi my names Adela and winning this giveaway would honestly be life changing for me. The one thing I have always wanted was to be able to help out my hard working grandma. We live in a super small home in Oxnard (the middle of nowhere ifykyk😭) and I really want to be able to continue my education in order to create a better life for my family. With the circumstances we are currently living under it is hard to tell if ill be able to continue going to college. I’m scared i’ll have to drop out and work some kind of job to maintain my family instead. Anything would help, ily james!! <3
I would plan to use the money to pay for school, further my education so then hopefully in a few years I’ll be able to help children with disabilities live a life just like everyone around them and not feel weakened for discouraged because they are different. Everyone is different in their own ways and different is the new perfect
hey sister 🥰 my name is alison carter, @alisoncarterx, i’m 20 y/o.  the answer is to INVEST SISTER. invest in products! or a studio! or new lighting and cameras. or anything else i can think of to help my personal business. i know i have the talking skills of a salesperson and the talent behind it to back it up. Money being my only obstacle.  As of right now, i would use a good portion of the money into investing to make a better future for myself. i would use the rest of the money to pay off family medical bills and other bills we’ve been worrying about. i know something good is meant for me soon, after so much bad has happened, so i hope this is it!
Hi James,   My name is Zulema Juarez and I’m 22 years old. I recently graduated from UT Austin with a bachelors degree in Speech-language pathology (SLP)- first to graduate from my family.   I want to create an Alternative Augmentative  Communication (AAC) device that supports and alternates communication for people who can’t express themselves verbally. For example- people with autism, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cerebral palsy (on some cases), and more. Most devices are made for English monolinguals. I want to create a device that’s affordable, diverse and suitable for ALL languages, and accessible. I already have a plan and talked to professionals, researchers, and my personal professors.   I’d also buy a car LMAOO I mean I really need one bc I’m tired of taking the bus 🥺 the struggle is REAL !!

Name: Meosha Brown Location: Allen, TX Age: 31 Instagram: meosha_chocolate  I have been looking for land to here in Texas to build a facility that I am very passionate about.  I want to build a center for abused women with children. I am very passionate about this because I was in abusing marriage 4 years ago and when I finally got the courage to run away all the center for women were either full or a couldn’t take me and my 3 children. I was told that I would have to leave my children with my then husband who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bi polar. That wasn’t an option for me so stay with my abusive husband for another year until I came home to my son who had his eye swollen shut who was only 7 years old at the time. I finally got the courage to run to a near by hospital when my husband at the time was asleep and the hospital then called the authorities. I know there is many facilities and hospital that say call this number if you are being abused but from my experience there was no support for families. I want a facility we’re I can make room for families so mother can not separate from there children. A safe place for them.  I would use the 20,000 as a down payment on the land.   I also want to build a center for Autistic children to teach them skills to be successful in life. My son is also autistic and I notice that there are no programs that help to teach children who are autistic life skills. I would like to have a small facility to help teach children with the spectrum these skills.   The 20,000 will help to get these two things I am very passionate about off the ground. I can use the money for a down payment.
The house is perfect, so is our QUEEN.

Sarah Spedden  15 Greensboro, North Carolina If I got $20,000 I would, not to sound cliché, but I'd give some of it to my mom. She seems like she'd need it. If not that, then I would save it for college or a nice house in New York or LA. But I honestly think I'd just go on a huge shopping spree then save it :)) 👁💋👁

Name: Portia Williams Age: 19 Location: Jersey Shore, PA Instagram: @portiaaubryn Hi James! If I were presented with this giveaway money, I would place it into a savings account to help pay for my graduate school at Villanova University. One of my biggest goals in life is to become a nurse anesthetist and be able to give back to others.  I would also take out a small portion of the money to donate to the homeless shelter and love center in my hometown.
my face really went 😮 at the end

There are so many people in the comments wanting to win and they all have a good specific reason good luck to the winner. I really don't want any money. So good luck to all contestants and I hope it helps you 💗
Name: Kai (not my legal name as I am trans ftm) Age: 23 Location: Colorado, USA Twitter: necro_feline Instagram: Necrofeline (I'm a digital artist, this is where I post my work) If I were to win I'd most definitely use the money to help my ftm transition (Helping with Testosterone and/or Top surgery) I don't have insurance right now, and was recently laid off due to COVID19 so it's been really hard to go without those gender-affirming things.  I wish the very best of luck to everyone else entering the giveaway! ♥
Name : Evelina Kochetova  Age: 18 Location : Moscow , Russia  Why: I want to spend this money on education since this is what I desire most . My parents can’t afford it, but I never lose hope for a miracle.
Skylar D 20 Troy, NY (518) 😉 Insta: Skylar.paigexo + Twitter: _skylarpaigee With $20,000 I’d definitely give most of it back to my parents who’ve given me everything in life that I’m incredibly grateful for. I’d also use some of it to be put towards my student loans; I am in nursing school to become either a geriatric nurse practitioner or a midwife and tuition is NOT cheap 😅. With whatever would be remaining I’d take my grandparents back to their country (Scotland) because they’ve been wanting to go but tickets are pretty expensive to fly to Glasgow unfortunately in which they can not afford. Hope this reaches you ☺️ & have a good day! 🤗
Hello James!!! My name is Lourdes Lizett Melgarejo, please call me Lizzy! I’m from Austin, TX. Proud school Teacher ❤️🍎 👩🏻‍🏫  1st college graduate gen  If I had 20,000$ I’d give most of the money to help my parents get a home. Unfortunately, they lost their home due to foreclosure about 7 years ago since my mom could not work and my dad’s business was not making a lot of money. I have been working since I was 16 to help pay for some bills and my college tuition. I just wish that my parents eventually don’t have to worry about rent. I’s also use some of that money to help my boyfriend pay his student loans. Love your videos, and I really hope I get the chance to win! I’ve never won anything!!!!

James I Love Your House... So What did you do with your old house, I love the new one, next time at 50,000,000 you should give away a Car.......
Hi James my name is Abril. Age: 22 Location: Zacatecas, Mexico. Instagram : @getzemany31 Why: Because I would like to help in the small family business of crafts. It's called Artesanías Judit, my family is a producer and right now, due to the health emergency, things have not gone well. Of course I know that there are thousands of more important reasons and with which your help would be better used, but I think that all of us from our little place can help the world a little. Thanks for reading and I love you so much 💟💟❤
So cute.
That looks like Rebbeca Zamolos house

Name: Audrey Faris Age: 19 Location: Indiana, United States  IG: audballx If I won: I have been inspired by you considering you and I are so close in age and its incredible to see someone doing so good for their age, and im happy to say that my boyfriend and I just bought a house, although it needs a lot of work. With that money I would love to renovate this home to make it my dream home, like you have done for yourself. With student debt and making minimum wage (in indiana its the federal minimum wage, 7.25) I could easily turn my life around with that money, completely canceling out my debt and making a home for myself that I can be proud to own. Thank you for being such an inspiration to everyone around you, and thank you for giving so many people this opportunity to grow because sadly money does affect a lot more people than it should 🥰
Autumn (@autumnfrodo) 26 Upstate NY, USA I plan to use any amount to kickstart my Digital Illustration career to go full-time instead of the “here and there” work. I want to be able to live off of doing what I love like you have - but in a world where algorithms determine your success, this money could help me showcase my talent.

Name: Ruth Zaracho Age:18 Hi James, I hope you can read this. What I would do with the 20 thousand dollars, First I buy a washing machine and a kitchen, and then I buy the makeup that I long for, but I cannot pay because I am not working and I am studying to have a better future. I really like to lie down and watch your videos❤️
Love ❤️ this. My fiancé and I are currently in the house buying process so this gets me excited. Definitely not the same status by any means but inspirational. 🏡 👾
Name: Adele IG: adelescott21 Location: South Yorkshire, UK Age: 18 Reason: If I won I would give back to everyone who has helped me including friends and fmaily they all deserve it. I would especially give some to my mum who is the most important person in my life. She has supported all my dreams and ideas no matter how crazy they are. I would also look into opening my own business. I have so many ideas and goals I would want to do in my life and even to make one of them a reality sooner then I thought would be AMAZING!  Thank you for giving me this opportunity. Also not sure if I had already posted a comment YouTube crashed just as I pressed send so I'm not sure if the other posted or not. xx
This house kinda reminds me of the layout of rebecca zamolo's house

Name: Allison Age: 30 Location: Michigan Instagram: @allikillewald What I would do: I don’t want to be another sob story, but I would use the money to help pay for my infusions that I will need to have for the rest of my life due to Crohn’s disease. I’m a Chef here in Michigan and work my life away but still struggle to make much money to enjoy life other than paying bills. I would also use the money to live a dream that I have had since I was little, to travel to Europe which I have never been able to afford. Even if I don’t win, I want you to know how much of a light you are to people’s life and I’m so proud of all you have accomplished.

Daniela Pina 22 Stockton, Ca  Insta: _nennaaa A couple of months ago my mom started to lose her vision and the the doctors told her it’s not reversible, because she’s losing her vision she can not work anymore and she cannot do a lot of things alone anymore and depend on her children. I would use the 20,000 to pay off her medical expenses and a couple of bills that have been adding up. She is a single mother of 4 I am the oldest so there’s still 3 little ones who need their mom and big sister to help. Unfortunately my income alone cannot take care of everything but I am trying and won’t give up on the woman I have looked up to my whole life.
Name: Ashley  Age: 22 Location: Tampa, FL Socials: ashh_kaay  Why: I’m a single mommy to a 1 year old baby girl 💕 I would use this money so we could finally move into apartment or home. Pay back my college funds and fix my car. Put aside some for my daughter, buy the things she needs. Give back to other single moms who need it. It’s been a tough ride being a single mom but she made me stronger and brought so much happiness into my life. So grateful that you are giving back. You’re the sweetest soul.   Hopefully i’m picked & thank you for doing the giveaway  💛
My favorite part of the house tour is that my whole house can fit into the living room OOOooo yeah❤️

Coronavirus has affected my parents small business, and they cant support my college career. They have a lot of debt from trying to keep up their small town business during this time. I have been taking a class for real estate to have a back up plan for my future. I would use the money to pay for what I truly dream to do in the future, which is Dental Hygiene. The funds would pay my way through a Dental Hygiene Program, as well as help my parents keep their business running :)
I just wanna day good luck to everyone and that I hope you guys are safe and doing good and I hope the money goes to someone who really needs it 💜
Omg where is the big mirror from

Similar to Scott Disick's
Name: Elaia Argandoña Location: Spain Instagram: elaiaargandona Age: 16  $ 20,000 is currently quite a lot (for my economic status at least), there are many ways to spend so much money, I really don't know what I would spend it on, maybe for my future university, my future car, helping my parents financially, Who knows what I will spend it on, right now I don't need that much money, but in the future I probably will, so I would never turn down the opportunity to win $ 20,000.
What is sisters?
The house is stunning 😍😍 Tyler ford  26 Nottingham, England Tylerjay_94 I’d spend the money on a down payment on my house and treat my family to a holiday
Bring back game with James!! 🥺
My name is Lydia Palker and I’m a 22 year old sister currently in my first year of nursing school in Vermont. And let me tell you it has proven to already be super tough. This is always what I have wanted to do and wouldn’t change a thing but this money would help pay for my tuition. I am from a family of 9 kids so I’m kinda on my own and I’ve been stressing trying to figure out how I was going to pay for even next semester,  this would be a blessing. IG - @lydpalk
Dima Umeh is our James Charlse 💋

Name: Cindy  Age: 27 Location: Clearwater FL Instagram: rognstad  If I were to win I would use 20k to go back to school and continue my education. I always saw myself going to grad school, but once I started working that dream quickly faded. I could not work, pay for all my bills, and pay for school. I would love to have that chance of finding out what I’m capable of. There’s so much I want to do and having the power of education will get me there. I would love to get a doctorate in Anthropology and teach others about cultures and what makes us all different.
If i have this money I Will help people that don't have house and I Will rescue animals because i love It
Tamarah  25 Cambridge, MA Twitter/insta: oxdimplesxo5  I would use the $20,000 to pay off some student loans and go back to school again, to get a certificate in a field I want to be in. Growing up, my parents would push me to do things I’m not completely interested in and to please them I made decisions based off of that. So I’d hope to get another shot and do something I want for myself without other people weighting in on it.

Dream house!!!!
Name: Alexis Ramos Age: 26 Location: Texas, United States  Instagram: makeupby_naye Why: If I were to win the $20,000, I would use most of it to finish remodeling my house. My husband and I still have so much to do but the most important is to add a room for our girls and fix the other one for our son. I just finished my associates degree and I have been working at a small school as a math teacher for 6 years without teacher pay. My husband works at the Sheriff’s Office and just got promoted to Sargent. However, with our bills and everything else we are having to put everything on hold for the house. Because things are not fully finished around the house, dust and dirt builds up occasionally and the cleaning never stops. Please pick me Charles! ♥️

My name is Ashton DeArman and I am 21 years old. I live in Atlanta, Georgia. If I were to win this money, I would use it to help pay for my wedding. This would help me start a future with my soon to be husband! Secondly, I would donate a portion of the money to the Alzheimer’s Association. My grandma has been struggling with this disease for two years now. There is only a limited amount of research and I would give anything to help future patients. Having someone slowly fade away and not remember who I am is the hardest thing I’ve gone through. Although, with better research I feel one day we will fine a cure. My Instagram is Ashtonhope___! Thank you for all you do and for this amazing opportunity!
Hi 😁 My name is Sydnee Deane. I’m 21 years old and I live in New Jersey. I’d love to win the giveaway to further my education and grow my business!! You are so inspiring and motivating. Thank you for your content!!! Much love 💗  IG:sdeaneo
I was so excited about his house tour. soooooooo freaking beautiful
I’m sorry, the house is absolutely stunning, but the whole video all I could think about was that the dog had its own bedroom and it’s nicer than mine 😂
Name: Larisa S.  Age:23 Ig:itsellamarie__ Reason: I am an aspiring YouTuber and natural hair influencer. It has always been a dream of mine to become a youtuber but I currently record on my phone. With the $20000 I would be able to purchase a camera, a laptop, a ring light, and all of the equipment that I need to support my dreams!
Faith DePriest 23 (Florida) Twitter & Instagram: faithers000 James, you are absolutely an amazing and inspirational self made mogul! I want to commend you on helping in times of sorrow and unpredictability for many Americans. This prize alone would help me, and my family in so many ways. After losing my job in April, I had to move back in with my parents and help raise my younger sibling with Autism and Selective Mutism. I have been using my small savings to now support my parents and sibling instead of paying off student loans, and making a down payment on my very first home. If I were to win this $20,000 I could finally make the first steps towards independence while still securing a future home for my sibling when my parents can no longer support her. I am a future Florida educator in my senior year at UCF, and I am minoring in Exceptional Education. My goal is to foster healthy relationships for those in the public school system who need special services that go beyond education. Special education is my life, and this money would help me kickstart my classroom to accommodate those with specific disabilities, as well as secure a future for me and my sister. Thank you again for all that you do! I have been a fan of yours since 2015, and I wish you all the best. Good luck to everyone. :)
You are so riche
Are you a Male or female

I’m so happy for you and i like the grace Johns vibe (clothes)
Why do rich people buy houses with rooms in it that they are never going to use at any point in their lives? It makes no sense
My name is Isabelle Labelle, I live in the UK, Im 14 and I would use the money to boy a car in a few years and also give some to my family cause they need it

Mi nombre es Belén Sánchez  Tengo 20 años Soy madre soltera  Y utilizaría el dinero para abrir un negocio para poder brindarle un mejor futuro a mi hijo ya que somos d muy bajos recursos
Name: Corrine  Instagram: Stoodlestyle Age: 25 Location: England  What would I spend $20,000 on? I have an invision of creating a YouTube channel based on my travels around the world. I think with any destination- most people tend to go to "Tourist" attractions where as I like to go deep within the routes of the country. Going to the more " cultural areas" and helping people open eyes to the hidden gems. I'd incorporate traditional make-up looks & outfits along with food. Wherever I'd go- id make small donations to charities which are in extreme need in that area. Just started a new job in the emergency services, and this money wouldn't just help me on my potential side business venture but also a lovely escape away!   Much love sister! X

Nina 25 Washington Dc Insta: corgidragqueen  I would use it for a new house I just bought. I never had much growing up, and I don't want my children growing up that way. I would also give to charity, because that is really important to me. A lot of my friends are rich, but one in particular would get some money from me
Name: Ashley Gonzalez  Age: 22 IG: amgbeautybar_  Why?: I would pay off my car so I won’t have to be stressing about that anymore. I would also start selling lashes like I’ve been dreaming of.

I wonder if the wood used in the house was custom made to go with James' tan.

Jovhanna Martinez 21 Harlingen, Texas IG, Twitter, TikTok: @jovhannadarling SC: @jovhnnna What I would do with $20,000,000: first things first is get my license and buy a car, then a house and worry about paying off debt. My mom and I are disabled and have struggled after leaving a very unstable, abusive and broken home. Being able to help her by not having to worry about where we’ll live or how we’ll get to where we need to go whether that be doctors appointments or the grocery store, would be such a relief. I’ve always seen you as an inspiration since we are close in age, I’ve always hoped to accomplish as much as you have in the beauty world. Even if I don’t win I’m so happy that you’re giving back. ❤️
Hola Soy de Bolivia tengo 27 y que haría con 20$ aquí eso es mucho dinero y bueno pagaría mis deudas y ayudaria a mi familia y sacar un negocio para salir adelante con bebe
Crystal Veal 22 New Orleans, Louisiana  Ig: Frenchii_x  I want to start an online store and vending machine business to pay my tuition so I can go back to school. I was a bartender on bourbon street in New Orleans but the virus laid everybody off and we’re still laid off with no promise for this quarantine to lift anytime soon. So I want to start a business so I can work for myself when I get to go back to school and keep money coming in just in case anything like this were to happen again. I also want to get a breast reduction. I wear an F cup and it gives me back problems but no surgeon will take my health insurance. I’m blessed to qualify medicaid free health insurance but it’s hard finding a good, trustworthy surgeon to accept it.
Wheres the sister piano? ;(

Heather Raines , 28 , louielouielouie21 , Ringgold, Georgia.  Hey Sister!!!!! , Love your videos. Just wanted to say if I won this giveaway I would use the money to better myself !! I would go back to school and actually make something of my life. I’m so tired of sitting back and watching life pass me by. I’ve always wanted to open my own massage therapy spa , So I would really like to go to school for that. Thank you so much for this chance. Good luck everyone !
Wow!!! This house is BEAUTIFUL!!!! I aspire to be like you!
James will never notice my response because it’s not here anymore :(
Name: Sydney Location: Yulee, Fl Why: I would use this money to help my aunt and uncle with their money situation. My aunt just had a baby and they're barely scraping through.

I would use 20,000 dollars to help my family and the poor because i heard giving back will bounce back to you
Name: Dylan Tecson Age:19 Location: Leyte, Philippines I will use the money to help my grandparents and improve their house. Because of Covid19 my mom lost her job, which is why we moved back here in the Province. My grandparents own a little sari-sari store to help sustain the expenses. I would also like to buy a better WiFi service here. The Philippines is known for their extremely slow WiFi, and since I'm about to start college I really need fast WiFi for online learning. It's a good thing I'm a scholar and I don't need to pay for my tuition. Hope people not living in America can win this huhuhu. Love your house. And the dog... Instagram: dctecson

I'd also love to invest into a small business, because I love bullet journaling and people keep telling me I should sell them, so it's my goal to create pretty notebooks and calendars, maybe add some cute stationary and my own stickers in the future!☺️ As soon as I found the courage to do so I also want to start a youtube channel and share some art work and journaling!  instagram: @sokkatta  Have a lovely day, good luck everyone💖

Mary Mosqueda  25 Downey, CA Insta: maryliza07  It would be such a blessing to be one in five winners of this giveaway....  with 20,000 I would pay off my debt and also buy a house because my son and I are ready for a place to call our own. You’re such an incredible and inspiring person. Thank you for being you sister 💖
I'll take the guest room thank you James
To house is so refreshing to see
My name is Ricky Rodriguez, I am 20 years old,  and @hombrecitoverde is my Instagram handle.  I plan on using the $20,000 in increments; I would set aside the first $3-5k to spend on my Mom, she deserves the whole reward and I love her. I 'd then use another $2-3k to DIY a home garden and replace an old fence in my backyard. I'd set aside $3k for my girlfriend to do whatever she wanted with it; she's my best friend. So far were totaling in at about $10k. I will donate $2k to a charity of my choice, environmental and climate groups, and global relief funds. I really would like to buy my first car but I realize cars aren't very smart investments. Id save as much of the reward as I could to help myself pay for school expenses. I have a small business and Youtube idea so I may spend a couple hundred dollars to get that started. Another couple hundred dollars would be put toward my hobby for painting. I come from a low-income household and a $20,000 reward would be a much needed crutch. I just want to be better able to give back and support the people around me. Thank you and have a great day.
Wow.... I’m speechless.. your house is so beautiful and the renovations you did are literally sister style forsure!! 🥳
Name: Jasmin H Age: 20 Location: Australia, Queensland Why: let's be real sisters I would like to buy some makeup, I am inspired buy your everyday looks in beauty, I haven't worn makeup in a while cause the store I used to buy my foundation from have stopped selling. I would also like to take some courses in the beauty industry and get certified, but I lost my job due to covid19, and can't afford to pay for my studies. I would also like to win cause I've never won anything before, it would definitely lighten my life 😂 But yeah I don't have social media, I just hope my comment is enough to make the draw. Xx

I really never participate in giveaways because I don’t really think I’ll win but wow this would be life changing.

I also recently got surgery and have had complications so I’d pay my medical bills and be able to pay my treatment.
I’m so proud of you james. your house is also very beautiful, you are amazing sister. ❤️❤️✨✨
Name: David Magne Age:21 Location: Palm Coast, FL I don’t participate in giveaways cuz I never win and honestly I gave up, but I dunno why I see a opportunity in this one so I’m giving it a try, I always wanted to go to aesthetician school and I can’t cuz I don’t have enough money and the 20k dollars would totally help me a lot, and if I can I would also buy me my first car.

Name:Zaniya  Age:14 Location:Texas, US  Insta:@queen.naiya The honest reasons why I would want the money is so I can pay for a modeling class. I've done two meetings. First one was a get to know me, second was because I got choose to be apart of their agency! But, my point is I didn't have the money then and there, that was last year in july. The price goes from $800-$1300 and sometimes more I just need those classes out of the way and my career can start. Secondly I would like to give my sisters money for their new home to say thank you for the money they've spent on me when I wanted fast food lol. Third with the money left it can help buy us, my family, a new house. With the money we are already saving for our next house we could be home owners! On top of my modeling job and maybe acting I could become the next big star and that's my childhood dream coming true. Always remember little things add up. Thank you 💕

Hi James, my name is John Paulson. My insta is @johnpaulson and I am 18 now. Basically the $20,000 could really help propel my forex trading journey  and with the money I make of trading I have been planning on creating a homeless shelter in my city. In this homeless shelter I would essentially help ppl make money and teach them the way of trading stocks and forex so that they will never have to be in the streets again. Thanks for the opportunity sister! Also I am located in Townsville, Australia:)
Name: Jasmin Nuñez Age: 24 Location: North Little Rock, AR If I were to win, those 20,000 would go into my daughter's college fund.

I want her to be able to enjoy life to the fullest and will try my best so she can ☺️☺️. Unfortunately I don't have an Instagram account is that okay??

Hello James, I am very happy for you and your new home🥰.  My name is Deylin Mabel F, and I live in Denmark.  I'm only 18 years old, but if I win your raffle, I would buy a little house for my mommy 🥺 because sometimes she doesn't have enough work to pay for an apartment.  I would also help my family with that money, since I have family in Spain and America that are of limited resources.  But I would also like to travel to the United States to meet you🙊🙈💖
Roy C. Dumanjog 20 Clarin Misamis Occidental, Philippines  insta: @iamroycdumanjog - if I win here I will use the money for my school tuition fee then if I have any left I will give to my family.
Carli Willis  22 Florida, United States  insta: ohheycarli twitter: icarliiiiii snap: ohheycarli  About a year ago I got out of a super toxic relationship, we were together for about 5 years. We were living together, had a dog together, and we were even engaged. When I left (because I found out that he had cheated with multiple people) I had a really hard time getting back on my feet, financially and mentally. I’m just now starting to get in touch with who I am and discovering the passions I have. If I won this money I would LOVE to be able to put this money toward a down payment on a home or toward a business. I’ve always loved baking and I do it all the time for family and friends and they’re always encouraging me to start a café (Carli’s Café 🥺) but I just don’t make enough to support that dream right now.
I personally want Games with James back  🤚
What I’d do to live like this...

Congrats on finishing the renovation! I love your kitchen waterfall island.  name: Ash Parker  handle: im_ashparker  age: 34  If I won that giveaway I would take 3 months off work to purchase and flip a home as well as film it for YouTube because I've always dreamed of having those two things as a career. Everyday I struggle to try and find a way to achieve those goals and I'm often left feeling overwhelmed and sad because of it.

Name: Karla Gabriela Iraheta Melgar Age: 20 years old location: Spain, Toledo IG: iamgabrriela  Why: in order to have my parents with me, since I currently live far from them in Spain and they are in my native country, El Salvador, where, due to insecurity and threats of rape, my parents decided that we had to leave the country.  I have never been far from them and I really need them so if I get to earn this money I would use it to bring them to Spain and reunite my family again is what I long for the most.   I thank God for the beautiful heart of James Charles and I hope He will pour out many blessings on you. 🙏😄

Name : Hailey Rudolph ( yes like the reindeer 😭 ) Age : 17  Where I live : Las Vegas , NV First of all , WOWOW congrats on 20 million that’s such a big achievement especially for someone as young as you ! Anyways , $20,000 is a lot of money and it’s honestly life changing to anyone who would get it . If i were to be one of these lucky people i would use a big portion of this money to go to college and get the degrees to become a social worker . I’ve heard a lot of terrible stories of children in the system and i wanna be one of the people that changes these child’s lives . Even though i’ve never been through that struggle i believe no kid should ever have to go through something like that . I would use part of the money to of course buy myself a car & with the rest of it i would help our family members who need it  instagram : @haileymxrx

Plot twist: james is giving the house away
Andrea 19 años  Soy venezolana tengo 4 años fuera de mi país los mismos que tengo sin ver a mi papá vivo con mi mamá en ecuador vinimos en busca de un mejor futuro y la verdad no ha sido nada fácil para ninguna de las dos es mucha la depresión que vivíamos día a día por nuestra familia que aún está en Venezuela. Desde que vivo en ecuador he tenido que dejar de estudiar 3 veces por falta de dinero. Con ese dinero le compraría la casa que mi mamá tanto desea y le pondría su propio negocio para que ella sea de propia jefa traería a mi papá conmigo y yo volvería a estudiar terminaría el bachillerato y después quiero entras a la universidad y estudiar la carrera que he soñado tanto.
I’m in Australia I am a girl but my family could really use the money mum has a few loans to pay off and I wanna help and help save up for a car for her

Wow James GORGEOUS, congratulations on your new place
Your house is so Beautiful
Name: Kayla Madrid Age: 19 Location: Tampa, Florida Handles: @vanillabuhn on instagram & twitter   My reason: I’ve never entered a giveaway EVER, but for the chance at 20,000 who wouldnt try. What I plan to do with the money is buy a car, first and foremost. Transportation is my #1 right now; I’m helping my brother with his daughter for a while and I need a way to get back and forth from work. I also plan to go to beauty school for hair! Its been a dream to be able to be a hair stylist, Im mostly self taught but I’m hoping to get a license soon in order to (maybe) get my own place one day. Even just a license is the first step though, and with the money it’d give me a huge step up from where I am now.
I watched this with a huge smile on my face, good for you James. You have worked your ass off and deserve every last bit of your success.
That is just sooo creepy that the guy has girls getting changed artwork on his wall, creep pervert.

I know it doesn't sound like the most exciting business venture but I am really passionate about it and it excites me! I spend hours at night finding the best duplex's in my town and this money would give me the jumpstart I need to finalize a downpayment and chase my dreams!

I would buy a computer for school since I currently don’t have one, save some money for college because i want to go to NYU and be an astronomer and study/learn about the universes

I want it I want it I want it
Name: Niamh Nolland  age: 15 location: tasmania australia  why: i would pay for my next years of tuition, buy a new car and buy my friends whatever they’d like
Name: Derick Jericho Cardinez Age: 20 Location: Canada Why: I would definitely use the money to better my studies as I am trying to pursue a degree in business. Being a student is with no financial help from anyone is difficult. Yes we may have loans but at the end of the day we still have to pay for that. If I were to win this money I would definitely use it towards my study. With the left overs, I would definitely put it in the bank as a savings so one day when I graduate, I have money to start a business and hopefully get my own place. It would mean so much to me if I win this money and I promise I will give back to others and use it towards good cost.  Instagram: werdcck
Sister you now have 21 MILLION

My name is Logan and I live in Arizona! I am a recent graduate from Arizona State University pursuing a masters degree in Physician Assistant Studies, and I am 23 years old. If I win this giveaway, I would use the money to help me pay off my student loans. When I decided to become a PA, I knew that schooling would be extremely expensive and would put me into a significant amount of debt, but working with patients everyday and making a difference in the lives of the people I work with is worth it. My Instagram handle is @logie_bear97 🤞💖
James inspires me that anyone can literally get their own house.... I'm next! 🤔😳🙊😊
His closet is my whole house

They’ve raised me & have taken care of me my whole life, so giving back to them for all the 19 years of my life would be so great🤧 wow this comment is pretty long but I just wanted to give you a little insight of what I would do if I were to be one of the luckiest winners!

name: Catalina Age: 16 location: Puerto Rico  Well, honestly, I am not a person of limited resources so extreme but I live with my mother and my brother and at 16 I have always had the dream of being grown up and fulfilling the dream of buying a car for my mother since the one she has is  giving problems and is not very good and does not give her the money from where she works to buy one since her salary is for household expenses and I would like to see her happy since she has made an effort to take care of us and because nothing is missing in our  home and I would like to reward her for what a good person and incredible mother she is.  Good luck to everyone!

Name: Kiana Clark Instagram: @yourhighness.boutique3 Age: 29 Location: Seattle, WA If I were to receive $20,000, I would put all that money into my jewelry business. I started my business about a year and a half ago starting off with waist beads. I recently have been trying to expand into actual gold and jewels and become the next Johnny Dang lol ( but my own version of course 😉). I’m fascinated with gold and helping anyone feel and look like King/Queen lathered in gold with my designs. That’s always been a huge dream of mine and this would definitely put me in the right direction.
HE IS 💰RICH
I don’t understand how people can have all white everything. I avoid wearing white shirts because I know I’ll end up with a stain 😭

This could be such a blessing for my family 😊
Name: Kelly 💓 Age: 17 💓 Location: United Kingdom 💓  I'd use the money to invest into my own buisness. I'm seventeen and had a baby 6 months ago so I'd use the money to change both our lives 💓 We're both currently living at my mum's house which is lovely but its so crowded and I'd do anything for him to have his own space 😞 Becoming a young mum is so difficult and I'd love to be able to show my son that you can do anything you put your mind too 😇 I'd also use the money for a deposit for our own home. 🤞x Good luck everyone :)  Instagram: @Kellyrainboww  I've also followed on instagram and Facebook, i dont have Twitter x

However, if I were to be chosen my partner and I would be able to pay off some of our debts and student debts too! Not only this, we would help out our family and friends and it would help us as we recently had to move out of our rented home due to our landlords selling their house. So we are in need of any financial help!!! Of course we would also give some to a charity as it’s always great to pay it forward. Love you guys so much and hope we get the chance to win this exciting prize!! Congratulations on the 20mil subscribers, you deserve it the most. Xxx 😊😊😊❤️

Name: Lucia Rodriguez  Age: 19 insta & Twitter: lrodrigguuezzz  Why: I love makeup. My dream has always been to become a freelance makeup artist and also be a YouTuber. I had to start working at a very young age. I missed out on being able to go to school to get my license. And working full time to pay my bills kept me from focusing on pursuing my makeup career. I currently work full time while also doing makeup, making and selling earrings and keychains on the side. I also sell fruit and other goodies on the weekends to be able to pay bills since i recently started living on my own. I also have always seen myself being my own boss. I would use the money to pay for school to get licensed, pay off my car, and expand my little business. I want to buy a little shed to open up a little stand to sell my handmade items and to have somewhere to do my clients makeup. I want to be able to be my own boss and do what i love. I would also use part of the money to put a down payment on a new car, and maybe my first home. This might be a long shot but it doesn’t hurt to try. I hope you see this 💕
Keep Working guuuuurl, love it. cant wait what you accomplish in 3 years

Mi nombre: Hadid Herrera Edad: 19  País: Honduras Instagram: @Hadid_Herrera  Facebook: Hadid Herrera  Gmail: Hadid.Elissa.Herrera@gmail. Com  ¿Qué haría con esa cantidad de dinero? La pregunta ideal sería que no haría con el, pero bueno, voy a comenzar. Vivo en un país tercermundistas un país adonde las oportunidades son limitadas, son pocos lo que tienen la posibilidad de tener una buena casa, comida en abundancia, y talvez no todo lo que queramos pero si lo que necesitamos, mi familia y yo hemos sido afortunado y talvez no seamos ricos y nisiquiera lleguemos a la  clase social media, pero no nos ha faltado nada, gracias a Dios y que mi padre siempre ha sido trabajador, tengo 2 hermanos, uno que muy pronto terminará su carrera en la universidad y mi hermana que viene comenzando, y yo que también estoy empezando, lo primero que haría es asegurar mi educación, aun que yo tuve la oportunidad de entrar en la universidad pública siempre hay gastos, y mi carrera en este país es muy cara, las cosas que necesito y los años que faltan las cuentas salen muy grandes aveces me preocupa nisiquiera poder temirnarla, mi hermana no pudo ingresar en la universidad pública así que tiene que estudiar en la privada, la cual no ha sido barata, la mensualidad cuesta el sueldo de un mes de trabajo para el Hondureño  promedio, así que si sumamos mis años universitarios y los de mi hermana hacen una gran cantidad de dinero que enserio aveces preocupa a mis padres de cómo le haremos, pero ellos confían mucho en Dios ya que en la necesidad siempre nos muestra la salida.   Nose si mi motivo sea egoísta, pero para que mentir, eso es lo que haría con él, tratar de quitarle esa carga tan grande a mi padre y tener la seguridad de poder graduarnos y la oportunidad de obtener un buen empleo para poder salir adelante en un país donde los gobernantes solo saben robarle al pueblo.   Probablemente nisiquiera leas mi comentario, y talvez hayan personas que necesitan el dinero más que yo lo cual no lo dudo, pero vale la pena intentarlo.
Omggg this house is sooooo pretty!! ✨
name: karen Cornejo age:19 loCation: CDMX, MEXICO WHY?: Since I was a child, I have had to work hard to get ahead Now that I am 18 years old I have paused my university future to save and pay my tuition and now if I win, I could worry a little less and start studying to one day be a chef and support my family, really this now is the only option that I have to move on and I'm a little scared  ¿porque?:Desde niña he tenido que trabajar duro para salir adelante. Ahora que tengo 18 años he detenido mi futuro universitario para ahorrar y pagar la matrícula y ahora si gano, podría preocuparme un poco menos y empezar a estudiar para algún día ser chef y mantener a mi familia, realmente  ahora es el única opción que tengo para seguir adelante y estoy un poco asustada❤
Name: kamila age: 26 Vancouver, BC I dont have instagram unfortunately. but twitter is @kamilagach my absolute dream goal is to pay off my parents mortgage. As immigrants to canada, they struggled a LOT raising me and my sister with no english and no money, and worked their ass off to put us through school. I recently got laid off and so did both my parents. My absolute dream is to own my own event company but right now everything has been put on hold as I'm struggling hard to pay our bills. thanks james!
So happy for you James Charles ❤✨
With the money I plan on buying sum sister apparel and more makeup to learn your sister makeup ways
Love love love💗💗
Congrats, James!!💕💕
Melanie Urizar 21 Woodstock, Georgia Instagram: Melanie Urizar 20,000$???? Insane. So proud of what you have done with your career and how you’ve changed the makeup game. I would take that money and buy my parents new cars. My parents are not from America and it’s really hard for them to work for their money. I would do anything to make them drive what they really deserve to drive.
This is so cute and modern
such an inspiration🤍
So impressed and motivated by James. He made most of his dreams come true and it just shows that hard work really does pay off 🥺❤️🙏🏼
Roseli Hernández 20 México Why: hi James... Hope you read this. I would like to be one of the lucky people to have on opportunity to make something come true you will see there are two things that I would love to do first is to continue with my studies, I left high school due ti financial problems and I would like to havethe opportunity to finish my studies, the second is that would be a dream for me one day to have a house of my own since we rent and sometimes we don't hace enough money and I would be very happy if my mother and my sister they have aplace of their own. I konw there are many people who need to make dream come true and I will be happy that anyone you choose has that great opportunity. No I speak English in fact I translate it in my translator so that it is easier for you to read it. Greetings sister.❤ My insta:@roselihdz

My name is Laura Valle I am 20 years old  I live in Texas 🤠 Instagram: lauraavalle03 If I were to win your giveaway I would pay the remaining balance on my tuition. I’m currently going to school to become a Certified Occupational Therapist Assistant. I am on a payment plan and have been looking into taking out a student loan to pay off the remaining balance. With this money I wouldn’t have to take out any student loans because it would even cover my tuition for the following year. I would be completely set financially on the remainder of my education! I also might even have enough to fix my car! There is something wrong with the transmission and I haven’t been able to fix it because my savings completely went towards school. This money would mean the absolute world to me. Although I am already on the path to achieve my personal goal of becoming a COTA, graduating debt free would be absolutely amazing. Thank you James! Congratulations on your new house !
Happy for you James💕💕💕
I’M LOVE WITH THIS HOUSE AMAZING WORK Mi sister James I love you so much  HIIIIII SISTER I’m John Felix a singer songwriter I’m from L.A and live in Indio California ever since you started doing giveaways, I’ve entered every single one because If I had the chance to win your give away I would use the prize to help myself bye equipment for a music studio I want to do to write and make more of my original pop music I have some on my YouTube channel, it’s pretty small but all I ever want to do with my life to to give people music they would love to hear anywhere when ever they feel sad or happy just to jam to it, also I’m 18 years old with a big dream to become a huge pop star and to perform for thousands of people to sing for them,   A lot of people say that I sound cocky that I say all of these things of becoming a huge pop star but My grandma told me “ There is nothing wrong with setting your expectations high because nothing in this world is impossible, so set your expectations and strike and chase after them I believe in you” I love my grandma she very kind and sweet I really hope you see this James like I really would be more than grateful if I ever won this giveaway or any of your giveaways to presume my dreams or to start them from small and work my way up to the top Also you might not believe me in this but I believe there is no such thing as the top because there is so much more to improve and more to reach Ima end my comment now because if I keep going I won’t stop also  This is my Instagram: Johndafelix  Okay BYEEEEEE SISTER I’m crossing my fingers I really hope I make it 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Beaunica Austin 24 Dallas Tx, United States Instagram: flytoparis   Hello James congratulations on your new home it’s amazing. If I was to win the 20k I will first buy a camera and a laptop because it’s so difficult trying to start a channel when all I have is my phone. I also will pay my rent off for the rest of the year to relieve some stress off of me. God I pray I be one of James lucky 🍀 winners 🙏🏾
Name: Pinsuda Srisaard  Age: 22 Location: Stockton California, United States  Instagram: lovelypinsuda   Reason: My son name Legend currently out of Oakland children's hospital because he was born premature. And I am in trouble of trying to pay his medical bills because my health plan medical doesn't cover the whole medication bills and his surgery bills. My son came home with an oxygen so he will need oxygen with him 24/7. My husband was the only one working, he work as an Amazon delivery, and he only made $900 every 2 weeks. We barely have enough money to pay our car bills, insurance bills, phone bills, and house rent. Not to mention we live under my husband's parent's house. Our bedroom is very small, barely have space to put my son's oxygen machine and his monitor in our room. Sometimes it's hard to have our own space and privacy because we have 11 people live under this house. Basically me and my husband hardly have enough to save because the rest of the money goes to food and gas. I also use my old work place saving to buy baby diapers and baby supplies, but not any time soon my saving won't last for long.  $20,000 would be a very helpful for my little family because we are struggling trying to survive this dept.   Thank you James (sister), I love you Please notice me!

♥️💗 My name is Joyce (@joyceee1230) I am 22 years old and from NJ. For personal use I would use some to help my parents out and also pay off my college debt. For business i would use it start my own lash extension business! It would be a dream of mine to open up my own little space and do lashes for people so they can feel great and confident. Seeing people happy and confident after lashes is the best feeling ever. I would also love to expand my business and create products for extensions and my own strip lashes! This has always been something I dreamed of doing. I would be so grateful to win. It would definitely help out personal struggles and will help reach my business goals ♥️💗
OMG when can I move in??? This house is gorgeous! That master bedroom/bathroom/closet/patio situation gave me so much life; I am obsessed!!!!
Alexandra Kirkpatrick Fresno, California 19   Insta: Alexak243  Why: Ever since I was sixteen I have been financially independent. It has been extremely difficult paying for my college education as my parents do not support me in any shape or form. I would use the money to pay the expenses of my college education, along with giving half of the money to my grandparents, who I live with, for all the wonderful support and encouragement they have offered me. My grandpa is 65 and still working to pay off their many bills. It would mean the world to them and to me.
why is he wearing a suit coat😭😭

james i know you've worked so hard for this so it's amazing for me to see you accomplish this and take such a big step into a big part of your next chapter. i am genuinely so proud (and a little jealous) of you and you never cease to amaze me. much love!
Tatianna  23  Buffalo, NY  IG: tatianna_delia Ouuu baby, $20,000 let’s see here 🧐 That kind of money wouldn’t only help me but the people around me. If I was blessed with this money I’d have no choice but to pay it forward and donate a portion to a charity here in Buffalo. Next I’d help my mom with bills, and get myself out of debt. If there’s any left I’d invest it so we can keep the dollars flowing, and use the money to restart my life in a new city.... start that new chapter ya know. All I need is a lil coin  Good luck to all the sisters 🤞🏽
Name: Bryson Dudoit  Age: 26 IG: brikaridu   Hey James! Alright here we go 🤞🏻 if I won the giveaway, a good portion would go to help my family in Hawaii. Specifically I would help my grandparents on Molokai who have been nothing but supportive and giving to my family. They currently live in an old plantation house that is REALLY busted up and needs to be rebuilt. Something to see rather than explained. I would use the money to help them build that house back up and give my grandparents a good retirement. They weren’t able to do this for themselves because of their hearts to take on responsibilities of other family members. Another long story I hope to explain in person. They are the type of people who literally gave the shirts off their backs to help people. A lot of who I am stems from the roots they’ve planted in my life and it would be a blessing to give them back everything they’ve given me. I would also save some of that money to hopefully get my own home in California one day and also get some health insurance. 😭   Thank you for doing this. Blessing 🙏

Angel Arlene 22 Hong Kong SAR 🇭🇰  instagram: @angelarlene_    - I only realised what I want to become recently & with the money, it would definitely jump start things I want to do. To be a certified makeup artist & a teacher which was always a dream of mine. We barely get any prices from the US since we’re in Asia, plug Hong Kong is literally a tiny dot on the world’s map which is a bummer but I’m still happy for whomever will win the giveaway as it is definitely a blessing for anyone.   Thank you for this James Charles, for sharing your hard work, passion + home with us! ✨

Hey sister! My name is Jordan and I’m 22. I would use the money to further my dreams in healthcare! Since I was young I’ve always wanted to do something that would benefit others. I’ve been a certified nursing assistant for 5 years and although it can definitely be trying at times I love it! I’ve gone through the schooling to get my prerequisites done for nursing, but with being a home owner at a young age like you, just daily living bills, and my husband also going to school for his business degree, we just can’t afford for me not work full time right now. With nursing school being such a time consuming thing I would have to drop my hours down significantly at work. This money would help so much to where both my husband and I could both achieve our dreams at the same time and really push us further in life! Thanks so much for taking the time to read this! My Instagram is : _.jooordannn._
Honestly he deserves this house after what he went through in 2019

Name: Sojey  Age: 20  Location: San Jose, California  Socials: sojeyolmedo  Why: I would use that money as a down payment for a house. As I was growing up I was always moving from house to house. I never had a place I called a home. My parents immigrated here from Mexico and it would be nice to buy a house in California. Even if I don’t win I wish the best of luck to everybody !   Fingers crossed & thank you James for your generosity! ❤️
I would use the $20,000 to pay off some school debts in order to continue my education and achieve the credentials necessary to finally let my dream career unfold. I want to work with adolescents psychologically in a school envoironment to promote their overall growth as not only students, but also as human beings - because every single one of them deserves empathy and someone to root for them. I also would spoil my Mom cos she’s the most selfless person I know and has literally given everything in her life to raise me right and protect me at all costs. Love that you’re doing this generous giveaway and wish everyone good luck!!! Thank you Sister 💕
This is my dream house! 🖤
I’m really happy for James. I mean no disrespect by this comment, but his house has such a similar layout to Jenna Marbles’ house, it made me realize just how truly crazy 2020 has been but also made me realize how far James has come from 2019. Good for you James. Enjoy 🤍
Your kitchen lokks like rebecca  zamolos but with diffrent colors

Hi! My name is Jazmin and I am from Minneapolis Minnesota.  Receiving that amount of money would be such a blessing. I am 22, and currently working a fast food job. I’ve balanced working and helping my parents watch my younger brother and sister and have not been able to afford to start college. I have dreamed to be able to go to school and study to become a family and couples therapist but I just can’t afford it. I’d use the money to start college and pay for the debts that go with school.

Tiffany Duran  20 New Mexico, United States  Insta: iamtiffanyduran   I’ve been working really hard. Two jobs, double shifts and so on. I finally saved enough to get a pretty decent car and I would love to get my own place. I’ve been struggling with a place to sleep off and on. There was a time I would sleep in my car and had nothing to eat, I had to leave my house with my family cause they don’t accept me for being who I am and would get physical and right now I’m lucky to have a friend that lets me stay with her but it would be nice to have a place I can call home.

Name: Breanna M. Age: 22 Location: Wilkes-Barre, PA Why: With $20,000 i’d take care of the most 2 important things my life revolves around and I owe everything to. First being my grandparents. For two individuals who came from very little to becoming established individuals, they never take time to worry and care for themselves. Even if I’ve ever won the lottery, the first on the list is to allow them to take time for themselves, worry free & surrounded by pure serenity. Without them I more than likely wouldn’t have went off to college & graduate college at that. So with them being my biggest supporters that brings reason number two as to why this money would be a blessing. I’d secondly, put the money towards the student loans I currently have building up. Bless you for this opportunity & it’s amazing to see how far you’ve came, James!  insta: bankbre snap: breanna _mm

Name: Bryanna Arnett Age:22  Location: Ventura, California Instagram: hello_its_bree  Hello!!! I would just like to start by saying thank you for doing this give away and trying to help someone in need!!! If I were to win the money I would put it toward going back to school. My family and I have gone through a lot of struggles in life which mostly comes down to our financial statues. I've always wanted to go back to school and further my education to get a good job so I could help us out of our bad situations but that hasn't been an option due to money. If I were to win this give away you would be changing mine, and my entire families lives forever ❤️ thank you James!!!! Xoxo
Name: Krystal Hinson Age: 24  Location: Alaska  Instagram: krystal_3769  Hi James my husband and I are expecting our first baby in February, this amount of money would definitely be a blessing going towards her future and ours as a family! We would love to be able to buy our first home and this would help go towards that. I would also love to set some aside and donate to local charities. I have always been passionate about helping others and seeing them succeed as well as spreading positivity! This is why I enjoy watching your videos as well as watching you grow as Content creator time after time you’ve spread positivity on your channel and have been passionate about helping others and we definitely need a lot more people like you and myself in this world.

Name: Kay McKinney  Age: 21 Location: Norwalk, Connecticut  Social Media Handle (Instagram and other platforms): kay_fyre What I would do with the money: I got into a two-year master's program to study biomedical engineering. I would use the money to pay for the cost of tuition as the program is expensive. I have aspirations of being a medical device technician in hospitals and clinics, and going to grad school is one step in ensuring I get there.

Hi James!!  My name is Alexis Quinonez.  I just turned 22 on August 14th! :)  I am from California, US.  My instagram handle is: justanotheralexis   I would use this money to put a down payment on a house. My husband is deploying this Tuesday for half a year but we plan to start looking for a forever home when he comes back from deployment overseas. We would be internally grateful and it would definitely help us. My husband and I are coming up to our 3 year anniversary in December and it would just be freaking awesome to win this giveaway. I know it will take stress off his shoulders. Thank you for everything you do for the community! Whether I win or not, I know whoever does will be forever grateful! Love you sister ❤️
20,000 dollars wow I wouldn’t know where to start. I just started college. I am the first to go to college in my family. I’m getting a degree in business for now. I’m not 100% sure what career path I want to peruse, but that money would definitely help me not feel so limited. I could further my education, or start my own business. There’s so many possibilities. I’d also give back to my parents who have given me so much. Especially after losing our house to a fire a few years back. Who knows maybe I could finally make my moms dream of visiting New York at Christmas come true.   My name is Skylar Ragsdale  Instagram : skyyragss  I am 19   Good Luck everyone <3 and Thank You James for being so kind 💞

First of all, I want to tell you that everything you achieved with effort and hard work is very admirable, I admire you for being who you are ❤️I would like to win one of the prizes to help my mother build her kitchen, currently our kitchen is in our dining room and it is not a pleasant environment, with the award I would like to help build a kitchen as she always dreamed of, she is a lover of desserts and spends most of the day experimenting in her kitchen, you would make a 65 year old lady the most happy in the world, I would thank you for life and if I do not win the award, I hope that someone with the same desire to make a loved one happy wins it. Successes in everything James, I love you so much ❤️❤️❤️✨  Saludos desde Perú 😹✨

Isaiah Castro 20  Honolulu, Hawaii (US) IG:isaialohaaa  Hello, I’ve been amazed by your talent ever since and have also been a fan of yours. Your videos and co-videos that you do with some of your guests is what I look forward to watching everytime😂. We’re nearly the same age and I’m genuinely happy for looking up to an icon like you. You’ve worked for everything you have which I envy so much. I’m currently working on my BS in Dental Hygiene and with the money you’re giving away... it will definitely help me a lot. The expenses in Hawaii are unbelievably costly and the temporary job I have is only enough to supply my daily needs. Win or not, you’re an amazing person who cares for their fans and is always willing to share back. I thank you for that James.

Hello sister, my name is Juan Jose Roa, first I want to greet you and more than the award I would be very happy because you will see this message and you will notice that I exist and that I have always followed you ... regarding the contest or the award, I just want to tell you that I am from Venezuela but for the. Political and economic problems in my country and like many people I had the obligation to go out and work selling sweets on the street to be able to help my family in Venezuela, you have always been an inspiration to me if I had the opportunity to be one of the 5 winners With the prize I would accommodate my house, and I would set up a fast food store and make a dining room to help the elderly so that they had a place to eat since in my country there are people who eat from the garbage and I would like to be able to help many people in precarious situations I hope you can help me fulfill my dreams and that you can see this message I love you James I love you and thank you for existing and making me laugh I love you sister❤️
What I would do with that money is invest it in college✨
Eribel Zapata 21 New York, United States Insta: eribelzx_ Snapchat: bellitaahh TikTok: eribelzapata Twitter: eribelzapata  $20,000 it’s barely what my mother makes in a year. Very few people are talented or lucky enough to receive this amount of money at once, so thank you for your generosity. To me $20,000 mean the beginning to financial freedom and independence. Coming from an immigrant single-mother household in which everyone works to help their bosses achieve their financial dreams, my family’s dreams seem unreachable. These $20,000 will be used to start a family business. My family is hard working, honest, organized, smart and kind we just lack the resources to build a dream of our own. We would love to have a restaurant here in NYC, just something to call our own in this huge city. We want to share more of our Dominican gastronomy with the world and hopefully bring happiness to people through our food and culture. We have the dream, the minds, the drive but not the finances.   Once again thank you for the opportunity James Charles!
This is my first time watching your video and omg...i loveeee your intro so much!! And when you play the piano..i was so shock & watch it again (♥ω♥*) i must watch all your videos after this and subscribe you (｡’▽’｡)♡ love from malaysia!!

Name: Daniela Alvarado  Age: 23  Location: El Salvador.   Hi sister 😍 Having an opportunity to buy a house in my country is pretty difficult but I want to have same feelings like you. I want to know how it feels to buy your own house. A place where you can sleep, have great moments with your love ones and build your dreams would be such great sensation. If I won I would buy a house so i can live in peace with my relatives. Here violence and poverty make people go through hard times. But if you help me my parents would feel so relieved because we will have a secure place to stay in the future. They will not be worried any more.   James you are an inspiration for so many people. Being so young and successful is not easy but here you are showing us that everything is posiible with determination and passion.   Thanks for reading sisters.

Name: Nazareth Monasterio Santamaria  Age: 20 IG: nazarethmonasterio  Location: I'm front Santa Cruz de la Sierra-Bolivia ( South America) Why?: Hi James, sorry if my english is bad♥️.  I would be one of the lucky winner for 3 reasons.  First I would search it with my Mom, because she's everything for me and she does everything for me and my brothers, maybe i could help she with some payments of the house and my university.  Second, this is my second year in Medicine, and I want to continue my studies in Brasil and it's a little expensive. I save the money that my mother give me per week and maybe i could help my father's with this money. Third, I'm a dancer and I had the honor to represent my country in HHI 2018 competition, I traveled to Phoenix-Arizona with my group, it was magic, it was a dream come true, but my father's can't pay the trip all the years and other parents can't pay it to.  The last year my group had the oportunity again to travel, but my friends and me couldn't travel and pay it. So with the money I can make my dreams and the dreams of my group true. We're a family and we want to grow as a group♥️.
This house is bomb ! Do you have room for one more sister
I want a coke cellar ☹️
This house is PERFECT!!! I wouldn’t change a thing.

I work from home currently and am in the pattern of constantly renting apartments and paying student loans like crazy since I’ve graduated college. I’d love to use the $20,000 to do a down payment on Tiny House and get myself all geared up with a music studio inside to get the creative juices flowing!
you can actually stay in any area of his house, very functional and comfortable.
the guest room is bigger, better and more aesthetic then my room... :/
WOW tour house Is so PRETTY like you 😘  I'm from Guatemala, and my family Is in a economic problema, If I win I Will give the money to them, because my family Is the most important for me Thanks
Wait James matched his foundation 😳😂💕
your amazing !
Molly Crook  Age: 23 South Carolina   I would use the $20,000 to help furnish my apartment that is bare! All of the money i make goes to rent and it’s really hard for me to have extra money to spend to furnish my apartment. I am a student so the cash is slim. The $20,000 would help me tremendously!! Whatever i didn’t spend on furniture would go towards my huge student loan debt! Doing what you love comes at a huge price around here. Thank you so much for all that you do i have been a huge fan for so long!! I love you sister!! ❤️💜💙🤍💚🧡

She worked 3 jobs to provide for me and my two brothers. She worked so hard and as a single mother. I have been there for her at her worst and her best days. I’ve seen her struggle as i grew up. i have worked hard in school to pay her back for everything she has done for me and buy her future house. you inspire me to work hard and chase my dreams to give her everything she gave me. with that being said it would mean the world to me if i won. good luck to everyone!!!

Damn, his bathroom is bigger than my bedroom. It's incredible how he is 21 and could buy his dream house, I'm really happy for him.
Honestly, Why is this intro SO FREAKING GOOD?!
When you ship James an Trevor (Trames)
10:51 he dropped his ball :(
I’m not hating but I find it crazy that theses people have such big houses with so many rooms that they don’t really need and people that need a bigger house or a house at all have very small houses or run down houses or no houses at all.

Margot Warshaw  26 Marathon, Florida (the FL keys) Insta/Twitter : Margotlala  I would use this money to pay off my student loans, purchase a real car with no issues, feel financially stable for once, and further my passion for glass blowing ! It’s been a rough year for everyone but I’m hoping to keep moving forward.
Name: Jadyn  Age: 18 Location: Springfield, Missouri  I would use the money to help start my dream of creating my own hair care brand for natural hair. Back in middle school I fell in love with my natural hair and how to do it since I had never really seen people embrace their curls. Freshman year I cut off all my dead head and began my healthy hair journey. During this time I realized that where I live it’s hard to find products for my type of hair. With me not knowing what to do with my life at the time but knowing I liked doing my hair and with the mix of some research I stumbled upon cosmetic chemists and decided that’s what I would do so that people with natural hair can eventually have another option to chose off the shelves at stores like Walmart and target. I’m currently in college majoring in chemistry, but during quarantine I decided to spend some money to start trying to jump start me formulating my own products for my future brand. My first prototypes turned out okay, but they need a lot more experimentation before I find a formula that I like, the money I would get from you would go towards that. My Instagram handle is jadyn_amaya. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my entry 😊
Name: Lupita Lopez Age:25 Ig: 1upita2  Location:sacramento,california  Why: Im a wife with a 3 year old daughter, our little family has been looking for reasonable priced houses as californi housing is so incredibly high right now..the more we look the further away from our family we would be for something we could afford. Woth that being said if I were I winner I would use the money for a house down payment with so much joy that we would be able to stay near both of our families..🥰🥰 thanks for everything you do  P.s your video with elliot has by far been my favorite 🥰
how much did it cost
Name: Jazzeray Garcia Age: 18 Location: Oxford, Massachusetts  If I had the chance to win, I would mainly use the money for my family. I have two disabled siblings and a mom who struggles to work because she mainly has to give her attention to the kids 24/7. The money would be a big help to put for a house and help my family overall financially. Keeping track of bill payments etc can be quite stressful. Since at the moment I’m the only one that technically works a regular 9-5 job, things can get hard sometimes. Also now that I’ve just graduated this summer, I will be starting my college classes during the fall. What ever is left with the money, I would like to use it for college. My mother is trying her best to ensure that I will have everything set for school, but I know things are a little rough. I want to be the one to be able to provide for my family and get us where we need to be so we can be set for our future. Honestly, the money would just overall be a blessing to my family.❤️
I would open my own gym, I love you and it would be incredible to win anyway, we wish everyone good luck
20 million ? More like 21 !

name: josi sparks  age: 18 (19 in 2 weeks)  location: ohio  why: i don’t need to give you my life story i don’t feel comfy putting it out there but i work a full time job & i want to move out.. my household is toxic .. i struggle every single day living in this environment & i’ve been trying to find cheap enough places to move.. i also i want to go CCAD (a really good art school) so i’d put money towards that. it would mean the world to me. i know everyone is struggling & could use 10 k right now.. but if i somehow get this... you’d make me the happiest person alive that’s for damn sure. xox

Hi James, the reason for this message is because I would like to earn this $ 20,000 for a reason, I am from Guatemala I am 26 years old I have 2 children one 6 years old and a girl of 4 years old I am married and unfortunately my husband and I are separated because he is in The US working hard to get ahead, that is the reason I would like to earn that money to build us a house and start a business because that money here in Guatemala is a lot. I hope you can read my message
Heyyy sisters
I can’t stop commenting as I’m watching this video.., GO YOU!! So proud of you
Amanda Richards  19  Boston, MA  If I won the $20,000, I would use the money to pay for my college education. I really want to be a teacher but I don’t have much money for college. I would donate a portion to a charity relating to orphans and or homeless children.
You think your designers can decorate my room in my parents house??
What I would do with the money is to pay the rent for my parents' house and apart if it is enough for some debts that we have, I am from Mexico and I cannot follow you on your networks since I do not have instagram I have an old cell phone model and I don't have space If I were the winner I would appreciate it very much ♥ ️
congratulations. so proud
Deanna Espinoza Dyanna, 24, Los Angeles insta : dyanna_esp 20,000 would be so life changing. And every cent would go towards my kid. It’s been hard trying to find a daycare that is in my budget and also helps with special needs children. My child is also in need of a speech therapist. I’ve been battling with our insurance to get me a good therapist and it’s just so frustrating and time consuming. 20,000 would set us in the right direction in getting my child the care and help he deserves. Hopefully the fact that I don’t have any other Social media doesn’t ruin my chances of winning 😭🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
Ur bathroom is literally the size of my bedroom lmao !!! 😂😂😂
My name: Andres paez Location: Colombia  I believe that many people have different situations or ways of investing money, honestly, with the money I would help to finish paying for my mother's apartment that we recently moved and are paying the bank, it would be the main thing to see her happy and proud of her Own department since I am from Colombia and since we have never been of good resources I will never say poor because thank God I have food and a roof that even if we are paying in 15 years it will be ours if we continue working but if I win it would be the main thing Like buying a room since we have never had one and if there is enough I would like to invest it in a unique, entrepreneurial project which can in one way or another help my entire family to get ahead progress since everyone does not have optimal resources to live and It would be main to help my family and have a project of mine, whether being a content creator of vlogs, comedy and / or graphic design company, it would be as in what I do. I would like to invest that money, I know the chances are very low but it would be a dream🙏🖤
You know you've made it when you have a grand piano in your living room

Name: Marvin christopher G. Angeles Age: 29 Location: Manila, Philippines Insta: me_marvinangeles Dear james,  I know that hitting by a lightning has more chance than winning your giveaway price, but still I invest my time to join because i want to win this not only for myself but also for my family. If ever i will win your giveaway price first i will give back to my relatives in texas who really worked hard just to help us and send me to school more specially to my grandma who’s been celebrating her 85th years of excistence on November in that way i can definitely make them proud. Secondly i will use the giveaway price to renovate our humble home, because pest ruined our our ceiling and it’s really my way to make my family safe and happy. While watching your home tour video i was teary eyed that gives me an motivation to work harder that someday i will be successful like you. Third and last reason if i will win the $20,000 I definitely use it for my laboratories since i been battling for a confidential virus for almost 5 years now, but don’t worry it’s not contagious and it helps me to look life in a different perspective. Again I believe that there is no small person to dream big. Thank you and Godbless you james more power to your channel coz you work hard for it and you deserve it.

Graham Heinrich Insta- @grahamcrackers620 Massachusetts, United States I think it is crazy how you were able to be so successful at such a young age. I admire your creativity and positivity! You are a great entrepreneur and an amazing role model. If I were to miraculously win $20,000, I would use it to help my parents. My parents are the most hard working people I know. They both work in hospitals and they have had a very difficult time in the past few months. If anyone deserves to take a break from work it’s them. This would help them with living expenses and using bills.
I didn’t know James was a that rich

Hi James, maybe you don't read my comment, I don't know English so I'm using Google Translate.  I would use the money for my mother who is disabled, she suffered a stroke 4 years ago and since then I took care of her, she wants to continue helping her and supporting her always ❤️
JaNae Perry 35 Herriman, UT Insta: janae_perry Twitter: janaeperry1226 Snap: janaeperry1226 TikTok: janaeperry1226  What I’d do with the prize 💵: I struggle with infertility and would use that money to cover the cost of IVF (baby making with the doctor’s help is expensive)! I do have one daughter already (who is an absolute blessing and was a miracle to begin with), that took my husband and I four and a half years to get; but my baby girl is now almost 4 years old and she needs a sister! Ya feel me, sister!? 😘 She and I watch makeup videos ALL THE TIME and OUR favorite makeup pallet to use and play with is your James Charles x Morphe pallet (I’ve got hundreds of pics and videos of her doing her “wakeup” with your pallet)! Anyway, we really want to give our little angle baby a sister, but have been struggling to make that happen on our own again, so that’s what I would use the prize money for. How awesome would it be to give my baby girl a sister, that was paid for by a fellow sister!?!? 🤗🥰  P.S. I downloaded and created accounts with TikTok, Snapchat and Twitter, just so I could follow your accounts and enter this giveaway. I’m not huge on having a ton of social media apps, they’re a huge time suck which is not good to have as a parent (kids are enough of a time suck as it is), so I hope you feel loved and special!! 😜😘

My family separated and all the members of my family were left without work and we are in debt without being able to sleep because of worry. give that peace of mind to my family of having peace and seeing them smile and tell them that you always have to have FAITH
Compare a house for my mother and I will take her out of the dangerous neighborhood where she lives
this is sister goals!!!! yes james
Instagram: @lahopeal I am 28 years old and would use the 20,000 to grow my independent clothing business! I am currently a behavior specialist, but am reselling vintage clothing on poshmark part time. I have found that this is my passion and I love sharing clothing finds with others. I'd use the 20,000 to brand/expand my business and invest in inventory.  Thanks for considering me!
Done plz give me the give away i live u and im your biggest supporter
do you need a housekeeper ? 😳
I have an 8 year old that has been watching you since she was 6 and she loves seeing your videos. I allow her to watch you becuase i think that it would break her if i made her stop watching you.
Name: Maya Williams Instagram: @mayajwilliams Age: 19  Location: Arizona What I would do with $20,000: I think the first thing I’d do with $20,000 is get myself my very own apartment! I’m in my second year of college now, and still living at home while all of my friends are moving out and becoming independent! I also plan to continue on with college, so I would definitely put a portion into savings for myself. I began my modeling career in late February and having some money to put into building my portfolio and potentially relocating would be amazing! It’s so awesome you’re doing this giveaway and I wish everyone good luck! Thank you so much, you’re doing fantastic James!💞
His room reminds me of a Stock photo
Con 20000 compraría tu maquillaje ya que me encanta.
Hailey pedroza 21 Seattle wa  Insta:Haileyjpedroza  Snap:Haileyhope14  What I would do with 20,000$!!!

Yo usaría el dinero para poder ayudar a mis padres con sus problemas económicos
He looks just like Kris Kardashian.
Brittany Dowell 19 Washington, United States Insta:brit_dowell Twitter:brit_dowell I would use the money to pay off my schooling which I am currently in and pay on my own and have my own apartment which I support myself in. It was also my birthday a couple days ago so I would live to be surprised with this amazing opportunity! I love your videos and watch them right when they come out. I would also use the money to pay off my car then I would donate some to the humane society’s as I am already very giving with the little money I have now. :) thank you for considering me and I live what you do so keep it up queen!!!!
Name: Daniela Zamudio Age: 21 Location: Mexico  I would like to use the money to buy materials and equipment necessary to educate children who live in low-income areas and cannot go to school
With the money I would buy a new house for myself and my family
Age. 11  Location. Athens Georgia Why I want to have the money is because I want it to go to college and I want it for my family and I just you know want to pay off our house and it would be very nice to have that money
Name: Natalia Mootee Age: 22 Location: Minneapolis, Minnesota Social media: Instagram: taliamootee Reason: what I would do with 20,000? There is just so much for me to do with all of that money! But the thing that I desire most is accomplishing my dreams. I want to become an aesthetic nurse. These types of nurses handle cosmetic-like procedures. These procedures are non-surgical and include such things like botox, fillers, and laser skin treatments. The reason I want to get more into this field is because I love beauty and anything to do with cosmetic stuff. I also want to be there and help women feel comfortable and confident with themselves. I want to help them achieve their beauty goals! That is my passion. I would invest this money towards school and accomplishing my goal of becoming an aesthetic nurse and eventually opening up my own practice!
Bien.  Nombre: Leinirys Marte  Edad: 14 Soy de República Dominicana.  Usaría el dinero para ayudar a varios orfanatos de aquí ( R.D, S.D.) , pues , yo y mis amigas hicimos un plan de ayudar con lo que podamos (ropa, Comida, etc) pero lo hemos pospuesto por mucho tiempo porque no tenemos los recursos que necesitamos, y  comenzaría a ahorrar porque quiero ser grande con mis estudios y en el makeup.. es mi sueño de verdad.  Se que soy muy joven para esa cantidad , pero siento que soy madura para mi edad , quiero ayudar a todas las personas que pueda porque se que hay muchas que necesitan demasiado ese dinero para comida , ropa..etc. De verdad me encantaría poder lograr esas metas.
I love the mini fridge flex followed by the warm towels yess queeen

Hello I am 19 years old and I am from Argentina and if I had that opportunity to have that money I would like to be able to pay my mother for an operation to remove a cyst she has and if I can help her with something more obvious and with what to save for college  since the specialty that I want to follow is not public and I would greatly appreciate that opportunity

Hey Sister James I LUV U!  name: Narges  Last name: Hosseini  IG: hellowhatsup163 Age: 13 and 5 months If I get the money I would appreciate you lotsss because first of all I would focus on my studies and buy things to do with it like tutor and more... I would probably give it to the shelter if I find one where I live! I would help my parents and make them happy by buying them presents and making them smile and also I will do the same to my sibling or EVEN my cousins! I would appreciate you LOTS and be very grateful! I have followed you in nearly every platform I have like tik tok, IG, snapchat and Twitter, you really are an inspiration to me and I have subscribed to you when I was very young like about 10 years old AND CONGRATS ON 21 MILLION! I really hope I win but if I don’t then congrats to the people that did 💋

I’ve been watching James’ videos since the early days and it’s so fulfilling, as a subscriber, to see how far his career has taken him. What an inspiration!  Name: Rosario Fajardo Age: 20 Hollywood, Florida, United States  Insta: Rosariof19 If I were to win $20,000 I would definitely invest it in my eduction.  I am currently a junior in college and I would love to attend Medical School and even though it’s such a rewarding career it’s also really expensive and stressful. I constantly worry about how my parents and I are going to pay for the remaining years of university and medical school and it scares me; but this amount of money would help in immensely, in ways you can’t imagine.   Thank you for the opportunity. Good luck to all the sisters out there 💜💙💚💛  (Stream Fine Line by Harry Styles 💖💙)
Name: Kenzie Methven Age: 20  Location: Athens, Georgia  IG: Kenzie.methven  Hey sisters! My name is Kenzie Methven and I am a 20 year old real estate agent in Athens, Georgia ! I’m new to the real estate game and although I love my job so much, it has had it’s challenges . Being in the south isn’t always the easiest, especially when you’re a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Daily, I have to prove myself capable to my clients because I belong to a community they don’t understand. Growing up, I always stood up for the under dog and it’s a quality I want to uphold into my career and through the rest of my life. With the $5,000, I would invest in advertisement for my real estate business to include & support minority groups, specifically but not limited to the LGBTQ+ community. I want to give these groups a professional, safe, and loving environment to buy and sell their homes. In the real estate business, minority groups are often not taken seriously, causing poor representation and little upward mobility. This has got to stop! With the other $15,000, I would love to invest in a rental property. A property free of discrimination! In Georgia, there aren’t housing discrimination laws protecting people of the LGBTQ+ community. This is absurd to me! I would love to provide a living space for people to feel like they belong! Acceptance and love needs to be brought to the south. I strive every day to spread that sentiment!   Thank you James! Your content has gotten me through some really rough times and I appreciate it more than you’ll ever know ! Congrats on 20 million followers 🎊
he is in all the rooms all the time
GAMES WITH JAMES PLZZZ!!!!!
Hi!! My name is Hope, I am 24 years old living in North Eastern Pennsylvania, and winning $20,000 would help me in more ways than one! Particularly though it would help me finish getting my dental hygiene degree while raising my 4 year old son. Getting my 4 year degree in dental hygiene is so important to me because I want to help others in a way that seems underrated. & that being their oral health care! Many people are afraid of the dentist or don’t have a dental professional in their life that they can trust so they neglect their dental care needs. I feel a person’s smile is the starting point to feeling beautiful & confident. I would also like to use my degree to travel to countries where they don’t have proper oral health professionals and volunteer some of my time helping them! So in short, I guess if I were lucky enough to be chosen I feel like I would be one step closer to my goal of helping others feel better about themselves while keeping them healthy and happy as well as continue providing a life my son can love and enjoy!! You can find my Instagram @hope821
I could live in your master bedroom.  That balcony!!!  🙌  And can I have some of those toasted marshmallows?!
Congrats James!
is there an age requirement??
Not I go all excited nd shit when he opened that door😂😂
so proud king, well deserved bb <3
Name: Jordan Bibbs age: 22 Location: Schererville, Indiana Hi sisters! I would use the money to pay off my student debt and pay off my car, and whatever is left I would use towards a beautiful high-rise apartment in Chicago or move to California. Hope everyone is being kind & staying safe. Sending positive vibes, good luck everyone! IG: JordanBibbs
Name: Sailee Stephenson (Sally lol I know it’s spelt weird) Age: I’m about to turn 19 From: Garden City, Michigan Instagram: Sailee.rose If I would be lucky enough to win the money It would go towards my college education, I’m a sophomore right now striving to become a travel nurse! I hope you pick me! I love you sister James and everything that you do, Congrats on 20 Million!💜
My name is Abby Carolus and I’m 21 years old from Kingsburg, Ca. If I were to win I would help my mom pay off some of her debt, and then pay for my school since I starting nursing school this semester. It would be a HUGEEEE blessing if I won ;3; Good luck to everyone!  IG: pimp_daddy_abby  Twitter: __Abby__Rose__
If I were the winner, the first thing I would do is help people on the street by buying them food.  The second thing would be to help my mom with her debts.  The third thing I would do is buy clothes because I don't have that many.
You are not boy you are a girl😂
grow up
This is really stunning the fact that you were able to accomplish so much in only 4 years is amazing.  I would seriously use the $20,000.00 to invest in me and my fiance's event planning company.  We love creating events for people on a budget, that really dream of something more glamorous than they can afford.  $20,000.00 would help me buy lots of materials that my clients can rent and use for their events instead of me charging them a higher budget because i have to search and purchase those specific items.  Its way more to it that just that but that has been one of the huge issues (decor and venue items).  So $20,000 to $100,000 is life changing.
His house is literally my dream house 🥺
name: lara thompson age: 18 insta handle: @larathompson.n  sooo my tuition to sarah lawrence college is due in 3 days, and i still owe $21254. i have no idea how i’m going to get the money, and it looks like i’ll either have to drop out of my dream school before i even start it, or take out private loans that’ll trap me in like $100k+ worth of debt until i’m like 60 lmao. my dream: to be a writer. to create the type of fantasy worlds i’ve lived in my entire life, and use them to comment on neoliberal capitalism and racial injustice. (if the doesn’t work out, though, i promised my parents i’d go to law school ahhaha). the 20k would let me stay in college this year as i work to pay for next year’s tuition. the money i make working would allow me to pay for the next year, which would allow me pay for the year after, and so on. not having to drop the writing classes i’ve already signed up for would make me cry literal tears of joy.   anyways. thanks for listening to simp for cash🥺. y’all have wap energy🥺 i’ll return to the circus now
Hi James! My name is Corey Lucas! I am 20 years old and I reside in Pennsylvania! I am currently in nursing school right now and money is really tight for me. My parents aren’t able to help me with school and I am doing this all in my own. I also have a car payment every month. I have been out of work since March and might even get laid off due to my furlough ending with my company. Things have been tough for me this year, and I just have been trying to make the best of it all. I almost lost hope. I am shooting my shot and praying that a miracle happens and I don’t ever have to worry again about not being financially secure. The $20,000 would definitely go towards my college and anything extra would be stored away for emergencies only. Thank you for being such a huge influence to myself and so many others. You are the real definition of a hard worker and you have such a huge heart. 💕 Love you lots! Instagram: corey_lucas22
Valerie Alves, I am 18. I am located in Suffolk County, NY. IG: valeriealvees I would use this money to help my parents pay their debts as well as start a business of my own or to start YouTube.

Name: Ireland B. Age: 18  Location: Dallas, Texas  Social: insta- irelandd.owenn  Reasoning: The $20,000 would be an absolute blessing to receive. Becoming a young adult is one of the most difficult upbringings. I would use the money to purchase a vehicle so it would allow me to travel more places and experience new opportunities. It would open a door for not only myself, but for my family. You really have inspired me to strut my runway. I come from a family of little to nothing so this would be just a little repayment for my parents. Thx James, xo
His patio is the same size as my house 😂
You should of gotten my mum to help design your house she is light one of the best interior designers in Australia

She has tons of horror stories with her 1990 Volvo station wagon but it met its end a couple months back . We finally moved into a cute trailer after 3 years together. It wasn’t the smoothest ride coming out in a hispanic household but she stuck it out with me ever since. she bust her butt off doing 12 hr day and night shifts. So if I win I would want to give back to her.❤️ IG: fancygal_x Twitter: zoee_rivas

Kyler Y.  28 Dallas,TX KylerKABOOM is my social media handle.  I hope I’m still eligible even tho I don’t use TikTok any longer.   If I were to win the 20k I would definitely put it towards paying off my car and medical debt. I would take my boy friend, best friend, and I on a vacation as soon as it’s safe to do so. I would also help my parents and sibling out with bills. Then lastly I am looking to purchase my first home as well. So having that down payment would relieve so much stress. Thank you for the amazing and generous giveaway. This will drastically change someone’s life. Congrats on the new house and achieving your goals. 😭🙏🏼💖
you've been in my country😭😭❤🇿🇦
The bathroom is the perfect place to have an emotional breakdown
Ok that kitchen is the exact same as rebeccas zamolo

Josie Farese 25 New Jersey Insta: josietytakesnash  Twitter: amberxjosie Snap & TikTok: josietyx  Hey James, I'm currently a Music Business student at Belmont University in Nashville, TN. With $20,000, I would begin my entrepreneurial dream of creating a cafe where musicians can come and perform for talent scouts, as well as just for fun. (I'd definitely set some of the money aside for the indie label I plan to open too).      The industry can be such a cruel place; I know countless musicians who have had their art ripped away from them, never to be seen, heard, or played again. It tears me apart. All I want is to bring justice and peace to those that have been silenced or wronged. All I want is to protect new talent from falling face first into a mess.   I'm in this for the music, for the well-being and growth of goal-driven artists.   A lot of people think I'm mad to chase a vision like this, but I'm fueled by entrepreneurs like you.
Is it just me or does this kinda look like Rebecca zamolo house
I’d use $20,000 to get more materials and books for my classroom. I would use it to take more classes to get more certifications since I am an elementary school teacher! My Instagram handle is makeupbyemilyy0 😊 I am 22 years old. Boston, MA
PLEASE PICK ME JAMES :)

Name- Ashton Ferguson Location - Virginia, US.  Age - 20 Instagram - ashtonferguson  If I were to win, I would put the money towards furthering my education! I am currently still deciding on which major best suits me. I enrolled into nursing school in hopes of getting my BSN however with the transition to fully virtual, it unfortunately made it 10x harder to pass and now i’m stuck with loans to pay back. I am now leaning more towards teaching or hair (2 completely different fields, i know lol) but I really do think I would enjoy making a life long career out of either!! love uuuu james, this is an amazing & life changing opportunity you are offering to your sistersssss!!!

I’d use to money to help my mom create her own salon, she’s been a hairdresser for years but because Spanish is her first language she isn’t always greeted the friendliness of ways, or it makes it harder for her to understand others. She’s always wanted a place of her own, but we never had to funds to start it up. I’d be eternally grateful if we were to win but I’m wishing everyone luck on this. Please stay safe everyone!

Name: Rehan Mugali Age:18 Location: buffalo, ny Why: I want to use the money to help the people in Yemen. I am yemeni and I know tons of people that need it. The government is corrupt and people are not receiving water or food and there living conditions are horrible. I will send this money directly to them and they will help as much people as they can. They are honest and trustworthy people and they honestly deserve the money more than I do. I am entering my first year of college and the tuition and expenses for textbooks, and residence is ridiculous but I will get through it. I know this money would do right by the people in Yemen because they are suffering horribly and this will help them in so many ways. It would mean so much if this money would be used to something much greater than all of us. Thank you My ig is rehannnn.02

Savannah Remkus 21 insta: @savannahrem Hi James! Thank you so much for this amazing opportunity. With $20,000 I would probably immediately start fulfilling my dream of moving to Los Angeles after graduating college in May. I would pay off my car, save for rent on a Cali apartment (cause we all know those be priceyyyy), and keep some saved for food because a girl likes to eat.... I have always wanted to live in Cali because of the many career opportunities and because of all of the different kinds of amazing people you get to meet! I would save a good chunk of the money and give it to my mom to help her pay off her car and hopefully for her to take a vacation because she NEVER treats herself and she deserves it! She has selflessly done everything in her power to see me succeed academically, physically, emotionally, etc. and I would love to give her something to show her how thankful I am. Thank you so much! -xoxo, Sav

If I could have the blessing of winning the 20.000 € I would help my parents pay off their debt first off.

Everything looks beautiful and Good for you. I am glad that some things in the past have now put themselves in the past. It may be from the help of your subscribers but it’s also the work that you and the people that work with you do,  so good for you and just stay humble and just start to brush things off rather than react.” What other people think about you, is none of your business.” (RuPaul)   Such a great thing to stop and think about and to help you just say “whatever”  and shrug it off.

Hi James! My name is Samantha Diaz. I do not have a tik tok (I used to but I highkey care about my information being gathered, so I deleted it).. although I do not have that form of social media, I do follow you on insta, Twitter & subscribed to you here on YouTube. If I was blessed with the opportunity of winning this giveaway, I would use the money to pour into my self employed ventures, such as a house cleaning company, & my ultimate goal, which is a spa that specializes in enhancing one’s NATURAL BEAUTY, this spa/shop would include my own line of all natural products from hair- to sanitary + holistic curing remedies! Attached to the shop would be the spa, where we would do facials, mani/pedis, hair treatments and providing take home kits (apart of the package) to keep up with the self care at home!  Another portion of how I would use this money, is to help my other half, pursue his career in screenwriting/ directing! He has amazing talents & has even acted in a couple of films!   It seems like each time I’m given the opportunity to save money, bills & more obstacles arise and make it impossible & I would love to not be stuck in the cycle of living paycheck to paycheck and constantly worrying if I’ll ever have enough money to save. My biggest motivation, is being able to provide for my future family and make sure my children are given the opportunity to pursue an education or create a business of their own when they come of age.  I know it sounds very out there and one in a million, but it’s been my dream since I knew what wanting a family felt like (middle school, currently 21 years old).  I would so appreciate the opportunity to still be given a chance EVEN THOUGH I do not have a tik tok account 😩❤️ thank you for taking the time to read!  Good luck to whoever wins!

Michael Jenkins  30  Toronto Ontario  With $20,000 I would be able to pay off student debt and be able to put money aside for future business opportunities. I’ve always been interested in production and the arts however, in the financial climate these days, it’s a huge gamble to invest funds into a business which would probably be meant for things like rent.

I’m currently a student and work 2 jobs, however, my parents are finding it harder each time to pay our bills. I’d use the money to help pay my parents debt and my student loans. Whatever is left, I would put toward going on trips with my family as they deserve a most needed break from reality.
i would use the money to help pay my student loans as I plan to graduate college in the fall. I pay out of state with no scholarships so it would help immensely with my future post-college.  jessica allen, ig: itsjessicallen  21 years old, 22 in october;)
Laila Ahmed, 30. Texas  I would use it to pay off student loans, and move to Colorado! We’ve been saving slowwwwly and 20k would help so much.
Hannah Curnutt 17 (almost 18😎) Missouri  i’m a senior and i’m applying to college which is the most stressful ahaha so I would definitely use that money to help with college. I would also buy a sister’s apparel hoodie😏 you are a star 🌟

Hello, my name is Gia Warkentin and I am 19. (Due to still questioning my sexuality and well, just being a human being, I usually go by Keiko. ^^) I know this is only for Americans but I want to do it anyway. A Canadian can only dream, huh? My chances of being chosen is a big fat zero (lol), but if James Charles should see this, I hope he knows that he is such a big inspiration to me and a hard worker that I admire. You have probably heard that so many times. Lol. My first and foremost dream to use the money for is to meet my best friend for the first time. Unfortunately, we both are very poor and unable to make the trip.. We met online and we are the tightest. I'm not overly good with words, but they are the reason why I am still here today. It would mean the world to me to thank them face and face and get to know them in person.  Whatever money that is leftover, I would give to them so they can go to college and complete their dream. Seeing them happy makes me happy. I just want the best for them. (I would like to note, however, that they are American.)  That is my top dream. If you made it thus far, thank you so much. ♡ Have a good day, my fine folk. ^^   Insta account: OwlWorks101
Omg i love how you grew 🤗You are goals af love you♥️The house is 🔥 Love it hard work pays off👌🏼

My name is Laura. I am 32 years old. My ig is @ vaydassmommyy. The reason I give you this money is it can get me started the treatments for my mother who has liver failure. I can provide proof of this. She has been denied Insurance five times and I can also provide proof of this. I'm in the process of getting her some help to an organization but this will only take us so far. Also can provide proof of this LOL this money would give me more years with my mother and that is absolutely priceless. I need her my little girl needs her. I stay in such a terrible depression cuz I just don't know what to do anymore I tried everything and the thought of being with that my mother absolutely kills me inside this money would mean everything to me. Thank you.
Hi James, I’ve been a huge fan of you for about 2 years. I need the money for school to get a start on my tuition and pay back what I owe. Love you the most ❤️

Kelyan Bolonga 17 London, England  masxkells on instagram, tiktok,  snapchat and twitter.   I will save the money so i’ll be able to attend university next year and achieve my dreams of becoming a psychologist.   And i admire you soooo much james. Your literally my idol. As a darkskin black girl, it can be really hard to find a good makeup artist that can explain everything perfectly. But you seem to do it effortlessly and it’s really shown. You’ve helped me overcome so many battles and i really do admire you, not just as a artist but as a person. Thank you so much💕.

Hi sister!  Emory Vilaysack (Eayv)  22 y/o Charlotte, NC  IG: HiEayv  Tiktok: EayvsDrop  Twitter: Eayv6 What I would do with $20,000:  I would put a large portion of it in a Roth IRA to help grow that amount so that I can continue to work towards getting to a place in life where I can live without worrying so much about bills, food, rent, or how to keep myself and my family under a roof during these times. Another portion would be put towards my dream career/goal in life: producing hard copies of the manga I have been writing and making story writing, digital artwork, game creation and animation my life. The rest will be divided amongst my family as well as donated to a charity to aid ocean life and the fight against plastic. I’ve been so determined to get to where I want to be: which is surrounding myself with the things I love and making it my career and lifestyle. If I were to win, the money would help create a solid foundation for me to build my own career/business and do what makes me the happiest while earning an income to pay the bills at the same time. I’m tired of retail and student loans sis, but I’m working hard to get there.

Hi James, congratulations on 20million sistersss!! I’d use $20,000 to further my education and get some equipment to pursue my dream of becoming a singer.   insta: avanimerritt
Name: Hailey Roknipour Age :21  Instagram: haileyrokk  Twitter: hailzbeauty California, CA YouTube: (here 😂) Dear James, I too have had dreams of becoming a beauty guru on YouTube. I love makeup and the way I can express myself using a variety of different colors to create endless amounts of looks! I feel like my love for makeup came at a time when honestly, I wasn’t feeling so good about myself. With makeup, I was able to feel just a little bit different in my own skin, which really helped me overcome my own insecurities. I learned that makeup doesn’t have to be a full glam makeover just to feel comfortable. It’s about embracing the natural beauty that already inside of me. The money would really help me focus on my future such as buying an actual camera (I film on my iPhone for the time being) and studio lighting. On top of that, I am a graduating senior at UCLA with dreams of attending graduate school, but financial aid for graduate school is almost impossible to come by. I want to continue my education but with expenses so high, I’ve been thinking of putting it off for a few years. This money would help secure my future for my education as well as (hopeful) YouTube career. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and I hope you and your team are having a wonderful day! Much love 💕 -Hailey
Laura Lansing  26 Texas 🤠  @lauraloudmouth  My fiancé and I are building a house of our very own with connex boxes (shipping containers) his grandfather bought many moons ago. I would use the 20 grand to build the house of our dreams! 🏡💕
i’m so genuinely impressed. compared to the hype house and stuff this house is very home-y and cozy and super pretty.

Name: Charlie Brigstocke  Age: 17  Location: Sydney Australia  Insta: charliebrigstocke  If I were to win $20,000 I would buy my family a Labrador puppy. My siblings and I adore dogs and we recently moved to a farm where we can finally have dogs. To be able to finally have a puppy would be a dream come true and I would gift it to my family so that we can all enjoy it together! So proud of you sister x
congratulations on 20M subscribers , me and my sister have been watching you since 2017. we love you !!❤️❤️❤️
Kayla Blodgett 17 yrs old Navarre, fl. First of all, winning this amount of money would make a huge difference in not only my life but my sons as well. I've always enjoyed watching your videos while I was pregnant because they would really help me get through some days. My family wasnt always with the idea of me being pregnant at such a young age and so coming to youtube and watching you would really brighten my day up through all the negativity. I want you to know that you are huge inspiration to everyone who watches your content❣But if I was lucky enough to win the money it would really help me and my son move out of my parents place and give us that first step in starting our lives and it'll benefit him in so many ways. Even if I'm not one of the five lucky winners I'll still be here waiting for your next video🤗💋
This is just beyond epic 😍 so proud of you!!
Natalia Franca 18 Oregon, United States Hi, holy fuck, I don’t know. It’s been a rough year and despite my age I feel like I’ve had at least 12 midlife crises. I am a receptionist at a local lumber company here where I live and my current side hustle is reselling clothing and accessories online. I just moved into an apartment with my boyfriend and we are just so ecstatic with everything going on. With the $20,000 I would go back to school and pursue some kind of business degree. I had to drop out of school to help my mom out with living expenses ever since she became a single mother of my brother and I, but having my own business has been a dream of mine for forever. I’d like to expand my market and have my own online shop with my own original pieces to be able to have an outlet for the creativity I don’t really use at my current job up at reception. If all else fails, I’d like to save that money to buy myself a house so we can finally get a dog! My mom’s dog is my best friend but he lives with her so I don’t get to see him often and since I live in a small one bedroom apartment, I’d like to have more space for the little one. I have been able to see you grow and it’s so incredible to think that you’re like an actual person? I feel like a few years ago maybe when you were first getting into makeup I’m sure you had so many dreams you felt were impossible and that’s kind of where I’m at. My chances of you seeing this alone are like 1/20,000,000 so that’s crazy but my luck has been absolutely nonexistent lately and I have to believe it might be because of this right here. I have an immense amount of respect and admiration for you and although you have come very far, I know you will reach so so many more lives. Thank you for giving these 5 people the opportunity to do very great things that without you they may never have gotten the chance to. Ps if you don’t pick me that’s fine but also if you see this, I just want a sisters hoodie. Literally any one. Thanks. Haha!
Stephanie live in las Vegas 42 years old and follow you
This would be the best house for hide and seek

She been the best mother in the world , also she’s unemployed so she would definitely need that money & I would also do a down payment for a car ☺️
I'm 100% sure James's dog teleports around his house
I am not going to enter the giveaway so that way other people who actually need it can have a better chance at winning but if I win, I would give to my parrent's so they could help support my semi- Large family. I mean lets be real they need it more than me

Name: Genevieve Garcia Age: 18 years old  Location: California, US Ig: @gengarciaaaa Why: My brother has been diagnosed with a super rare disease that only a small percentage of kids get and there is no cure. He got diagnosed at the age of 9 and has to go to the hospital every month to get an infusion so they can contain his disease. When he first got diagnosed he could barely run because this disease was eating at his muscles and bones so it made him very weak. He started with 9 pills a day and going into the hospital for treatment every 2 weeks. He is gonna have to live with this disease for the rest of his life.  I would like to win the money so I can give it to my parents to help pay for those bills because I and a child of 4 and 2 of us are in college and I want to make their lives easier. They do so much for us and I want to give back to them! This money would mean so much to them and help us out a lot! James is such a great person who is always giving back and I am hoping that my family could be the next people he helps out ! James you are such an inspiration in what you do and who youve become!
My name is Abbey, I’m 21, and my insta is xabbeychristinex. I’m currently living in North Carolina with my loving husband who is in the Marine Corps and our sweet pup. I’m actually from upstate New York, about an hour from where you grew up! I have friends who danced for Anthony and I saw him perform many many times! I even have some merch stored away of his! There are many things that this money would go towards, but honestly the biggest thing would be the new member of the family that is coming in April! This is our first child, and we are so so blessed to have this bundle of joy arriving in the new year. We’re also in the process of buying our first home, and I have so many ideas of what the nursery will look like and I can just imagine our sweet babe growing up and changing with their environment. We haven’t had our first scan yet, but when we do I’ll be more than happy to send you pictures of the little peanut if you’d like!!  I’m so excited to see all of your new videos in your beautiful home. You are truly blessed. 💖

His house looks like Pinterest
🤍✨ My name is Claudia Torres✨🤍 My Instagram: @Clawde.a I’m 19 years old and I currently live in Arizona and I just graduated high school. I was love to use the money for my education onto becoming a dental assistant.... it’s a start I want to help people feel confident and in their own smiles... It would really help me because my student loan doesn’t cover everything and I’ve been working two jobs at Target and Walmart which is stressful. Since I’m also Trying to save up money as well for a car. It’s really hard to save money when I have to lyft and take the bus to work or school because my parents aren’t willing to take me nor help me... so The money would be COMPLETELY HELPFUL and I would be honored and sooo appreciated if I earn this giveaway, but by the way congratulations. So proud of you!
James I love your vids
James could go into real estate if he wanted to 😹
Omg i just saw that that house is almost the same as rebecca zomolo
Me cry’s because I’m only 14 and I would put this money to good use. 😭😭😭😭

James Thought he was belle when he tried to slide on that latter 🤣💀
How do you get the money lol?and I subscribed and turned on notifications and liked this video so yeah I'm desperate for this money
Jacqui', @jacqui_rubsam, 31. I would use the money to get rid of my student loan debt and to start building a down payment for a home for my family.
omg am Obsessed with this house
Jake Harvey 19 California, United States Insta: jake.alha Twitter: jakexharvey Tiktok: j.akeh Snapchat: j.akeh  Honestly if I got the $20k I use it to jumpstart my career I making and composing music! I’d love to be able to upgrade my computer to something that run more effectively, and also afford all of the essential programs and plug-ins to start making fully realized pieces of music. Maybe even purchase a real piano! I think with that with these improvements, I can finally stop using MuseScore, a free notation software for composers and arrangers. My music would be higher quality and I would be able to get a foot into the community, rather than eagerly waiting outside its door. I’d be so grateful if I won!
Next video you need to play more piano <3
Your beautiful girl
Ive always wanted a wine cellar 🤭😍❤️ congrats so happy for you you couldnt be more deserving
Love U
I would love to win, I’m 22 in Ohio I’d use that money to get a car mine was just totaled someone hit me at 60mph anywho I’d also pay off some of my college bills I go to University of Cincinnati

Beautiful house very inspiring ☺️🌱☀️

This literally looks like my house in ADOPT ME 💞💞💞💞💞💞💛💛💛💛💛💛
Hi James!  This is Hoang Nguyen but people usually call me Nikki. I'm your hugeeee fan since you started youtube. I'm currently 19 years old. I'm originally from Vietnam 🇻🇳 and I'm living in Sacramento CA for 2 years now. ( I got better in English because of you ...YOU KNOW... you talk fast and it force me to try to understand what you're saying LOL) If I'm the lucky one to get this $20,000; I would like to keep $15k for myself. this amount can  help me to get closer to my goal and my dream which is open a nail salon; and the other $5k I will send them to some of the orphanage in my country, maybe it's not much for us but I know for sure that amount can help them a lot. Again congratulations🥳. I'm very happy to see you achieved your goal, your dream. You're my inspiration James !
Ardenis Gashi 19 Germany, Aalen if i would win 20.000 dollars i would like to help the dogs and cats in Kosovo, my parents are from Kosovo because i’m really sad when i go there i see a lot of pets on the street hungry and sad i hope I will win so i can try to make a change there
*I went to skip the ads when he did the little montage then I realised it was his home*
why is my whole entire house the size of Jame's bedroom lol
I can’t wait to see what your house looks like at Christmas 🎄💚❤️
If I got the money I would give most of it to my parents because they are amazing and made my life I would put the rest in my bank account and buy sisters apparel
Name : Narciso  Age: 19 almost 20 Location : Spain / social media: narcisoooo_ ( Instagram )   20K$ WHY:  I would use that money to invest in my future by finishing my marketing studies in Barcelona and also studying visual merchandising & window dressing Master which it cost like almost 6K $, I've always loved fashion industry and It'll be so much to me to accomplish that and seeing me in a future working for big brands like LV .. a dream come true🥺 Also I would use the money to travel to the USA because I would want to find any sources to increase my fashion knowledge and improve my English and who knows maybe work there for a while.. And maybe someday start my own brand!!! Oh god James the level of happiness if I win that money would be extremely high!!  I KNOW im not from USA but Im not loosing nothing by pursuing my dreams😘

Name: Christine Age: 23 Location: New Jersey, USA Twitter: @ladydextro Why: because it would change my life. It would change my daughter's life. It would help us a lot. I had my daughter when I was 14, unfortunately I didn't finish school but I really really want to go to medical school and be a doctor someday. I don't know what else to say! But I hope whoever does win, truly gets what they want or need in life. Lots of love 💞
The master bathroom is bigger than my room 😕
Wow nessa then james whos next
Amanda Arambula 22 Texas, USA Twitter:  @CurlyyHeadMa   IG: @amanda.aram If I was even BLESSED to receive your giveaway I would first of all CRY! But I think for sure pay my parents medical bills. Pay for my own tuition to start my path of becoming a physical therapist. And most definitely I'd put part of it towards humanitarian work. I've always wanted to help with environmental issues, human rights, and so much more. Thank you James for giving people the opportunity to do good! <3
Name- Sierra Wesson Instagram Handle- @sierrarenewesson Age- 23 Location- South Carolina Why- I don’t want to make a pity party, because I know there’s millions of others much worse off than me, so I won’t. However, if I were to win money, however much, I would use it towards building up my doggy daycare and rescue business. I’ve been trying to build my business up for a year now, and it’s hard without funds. I’ve ran out of room and money for the supplies needed for veterinarian check-ups and vaccines etc. I have always had a passion for animals and I breakdown every time I see them being mistreated.  I just saw this as an opportunity to put myself out there where my anxiety usually won’t let me do this kind of thing. Asking for help sucks. If someone needs the money more, by all means give it to them first.
Very well done
I LOVE SISTER JAMESSS
This is such a gorgeous house 🏡 😍 I love everything about it 💙💜💙
Love your house , I’m 30 years old . I would pay my debt. I’m jobless with two kids. Insta: ace_one_89 💋🌸

Katelyn Schoelles 23  Bethlehem, PA  Insta: beautybecameofherxo Snap: katexo_2 TikTok: @katelynschoelles Twitter: beautybecameher  With the $20,000 I would go back to school to get my Masters Degree in Social Work. I do have my Bachelors Degree in Social Work and decided to take some time off from school to save money. I currently work for a non-profit and want to continue to help people and make a difference in the lives of others. If there was any money leftover after school payment which is highly unlikely I would save the money for a down payment on a house. I would love to own my own house one day as I’ve never had my own home. This would be an incredible opportunity and I love seeing your beautiful home!
❤️🧡💛💚💙💖💖💖

Lauren Hernandez 19 Years Old  Houston Texas Socials IG,Twitter,Youtube,Tiktok  / Laurensrevenge Why, I’d aspire to be greater than I am now, I’m a full time college student who has taken the last 5 years of my life to dedicate it towards my Beauty Career, getting amazing opportunities to work with NYX and BENEFIT. This award to be a winner amongst 4 others would be the icing on the cake to build my very own beauty studio and pay off all my classes for college. I am majoring in Business Marketing, and to watch you grow since the beginning blows my mind! We started around the same time and you gave me the vision of where I want to be! I am proud of you and all your success! The house is beautiful! A goal of mine!

Name: Bao Le Age: 19 Location: Kansas City, Missouri Why: My parents has worked hard and paid a lot for me when I am just getting started in life. Such as school, groceries, cars, etc. I would like to repay them. They did so much for me and our living, work hard all day, and I love them very much. This would also be a great start for me to start paying my own things now since I am an adult. I just finished beauty school and about to work the real job out there. I would like to join dance and acting classes to practice. I feel like there is more to me than just a "hairstylist." I pray for success, happiness, financially stable, and peace for everyone.

Yay!! So happy for you James, congrats on a beautiful home! 😊   Side note, sorry if this is a weird question, but in the successful YouTube world, how does one go about buying a home? Did you have to do a down payment or could you just pay for the house and renovations in full up front? I know I’m being nosy, but if I were to win the lottery and pay off my house 100%, it would be magical 😂 ❤️
the closet looks like colleen baligengers idky

Nataliah Smith-Vargas  19 Florida, United States Insta: Nataliahsmith  Twitter: Nataliahsmith1 Snapchat: Nataliah_smith TikTok: Nataliahsmith  First and for most I’m so proud of you James Charles for making it this far and having the opportunity to do this for people it really melts my heart and I hope one day to do the same. If I were to receive this blessing of a $20,000 giveaway: I will put it towards my dream of becoming a DOCTOR of physical therapy, just a couple of days ago I’ve come to the realization that there is no way I can afford $175,000 to go to school and it breaks me that this can ruin my dreams because of interest and debt. I may not be an extraordinary girl ,but all I want is to be able to support my future family with my prioritized goal of starting college funds for my children even before they are born so that NOTHING shall be in the way of their happiness, so that they can be stars no matter what challenges the universe may bring, to know I’ve done everything in my power to promote their success.  Being a physical therapist is important to me because I want nothing more than to help people heal from injuries, pains, etc.. I want to give people HOPE that they can get through anything with a little help from ME. I want to be known as the person who helped someone walk, feel, grab, play the sport of their dreams again. I don’t want anyone to give up on themselves due to a body failure. To help people live, love, and laugh with the best quality of life. Once again thank you James Charles & Co for giving everyone this amazing opportunity you are truly an idol no matter the outcome!

Name: Deanna R <3 Age: 14 <3 Location: Springfield, Virginia <3 Insta: @deannarafik <3  Why I believe 20,000 will benefit me and my wonderful hardworking mother. First off let me just say congratulations on hitting 20 million subscribers at such a young age! Honestly so crazy amazing!!! U (Sister James <3) have had such a big impact on me and many other people across the world by being such a great person and showing the world love. With 20,000 I would honestly give part to my amazing mother so she can buy us a place we can call home. she had gotten lymes disease about 7 years ago and we lost almost everything besides god. our home, our pets, our hope, everything just felt that this was the end. thankfully 3 yrs after she had gotten it, she got the treatment to cure her but for those 3 yrs she wasn’t working and she was unable to take care of me so I had to get sent to California to stay with her sister. the bills went up and at a young age I didn’t fully understand and I was scared. but thankfully we have a roof over our heads (we have a roommate) and food but having our own place we can call our home rather than someone’s house, would honestly mean the world. my mother has been a single mom my whole life and has taught me to always chase my dreams and not to care what people say or think. so to give back I would want to dedicate some of this money to her. Also I would give part of this money to those in need. I love seeing other people smiling because honestly the world has so much hate going on and I feel like the world just needs more love and happiness. I was taught that if u do good, the universe will bring good back. (if that makes any sense haha) then with the leftover money I would really like to save it for my future college tuition. I play soccer and currently been training for long hours (on my own because of corona) so I can get better and hopefully make my high school team (off track but I start freshman yr in 2 days! :)) ) I know if I make this team it could lead me in the right path and have great advantages from recruits from colleges. i would really enjoy getting the recognition by such important professional because it would feel like all my hard work has paid off. (if I make my high school team which I’m praying to make maybe u could come out and watch a game! ik it may be hard since ur basically on the other side but that would be pretty amazing haha <3 ) now that I basically have written an essay i just wanted to congratulate u one more time on everything u have overcome and achieved in life! May u take me in consideration of one of ur winners and I promise this money will be used for a good cause. love of love <3 - sister deanna!! :)
100k would change my life... I would legit share it with my gorgeous wife and pay off bills and start fresh ... Dang.. what a dream
James’s closet legit looks like the one from scream queens😟
Did u win the lottery james! ❤️
bruh you took my dream house
My IG handle is @fisforfaiza I’d invest 20k in my indépendant black owned digital media company and finally shoot my short film! 37 yo
Name: Lou Avery Age: 30 Location: Covington, KY IG: littlethinggonewild Why: I want to start a small business and it would help cover my ER bills and help me see a doctor as I am currently unemployed and uninsured, so that I can begin fixing my health and then start doing things outside of being in and out of the ER since I can't afford to see a doctor and get my teeth fixed, etc. It basically would help me begin to get my life under control again so I can do something other than have health issues crop up.
Woww...    Well deserved 🥰
Name: Courtney King Insta: @courtneyking_ Age: 22 Location: NJ I would use the money to help pay off my student loans and use it for classroom resources!! I am a first year, first grade teacher and I could use all the help I could get - and this would really mean so much to me!!!

Congratulations James on the new house :) you deserve it
OMG the house of my dreams. 🥰.   If I was so fortunate to win that would be the first time I ever won anything ☺️ I would use the money to Pay off all my bills.  I live on a fixed income and it would be nice for once to be debt-free and catch up on my house payment.  I live in Riverside county and wish I had the money to fix the air conditioning as well, get my brakes fixed, because it gets really hot down here. So many things that I would be able to do if I won that money. 😘Patricia Williamson, aka Curlypdub on YouTube and pdubstuff on YouTube, I am age 64.  I’m probably your oldest sister’s subscriber 🙂

My ig is lil_shorty_jackie  If I  win I would first put half of it away for saving then I would get a new apartment or get a little condo. Then I would go get each of my family members a little gift and fly down to California because I miss my mother soo much and get new clothes because rn I can’t afford any new clothes because I’m struggling to even just pay rent but then finally I would start my lip gloss brand I don’t wear much makeup but I love it soo much I can do or be anything I want to be with it and think making my own lipgloss would just be soo fun. Thank you for this wonderful opportunity and a big congratulations on the house it’s beautiful and you deserve everything gray that comes your way ❤️❤️

I’m currently in the process of moving out of my parents home into an apartment, been creating and doing makeup for 5 years now and have always been doing it locked up in my room or really late at night so my parents would never catch me with a full face. 20k would really help me with a lot with moving costs, furniture, groceries, etc! I’m tired of having to hide who I am and moving out would really let me be the person I’ve always wanted to be! You’ve definitely inspired me so much and being a winner would just really help me out so so much! Thank you James again for this opportunity!

Rhianna Robles  23 Dallas, Texas  All socials : zerogattsu It would help me be able to focus on my art business. I'm someone who likes to do multiple different creative projects and do it all by myself. I'd have the finical stability to support myself since I've been on my own the last three years.

Paige Osborne Age:19 Green Bay, Wisconsin   I would put a down payment on a house. It’s been a dream since a kid and I’m tired of my 1 bedroom apartment lmao. Congratulations on your new house. I hope you prosper even more in your near future.❤️
I think that it’s is so amazing that a 21 year old can be so successful
His house reminds me of that pockets of peace girl
To be honest, I think James truly deserves this. I know for a fact that not everyone knows how much work it is to actually run a YouTube channel full time, yet alone a business too! James you deserve this, you earned it, you enjoy it🙂
James is the absolute best
The kitchen is just like rebbeca zamolo layout
That house is gorgeous.

*cries in poor*
Hiiii sister James!!! My name is Sarah and I've been a sister for a very long time. I am currently going to a top make up school in Florida to try and learn more. If I were to win I would put the money to more classes to help grow my skills and for products to help with my kit. For the money left I would put into savings for when I am out in the real world. My goal is to end up in LA which is probably tons of makeup artist dreams. but uhh hey I would be so grateful to win this.
Ohhh my gosh why’s that outfit so bombb
Omg you've now brought your new house take care, god bless,and stay safe Charles💖
Brenna Riley  18 Ripley, West Virginia (small town) I would put it towards my college and probably get a new car because I have a 2008 Kia Rio with about 220,000 miles on it and she’s had her time. I love what you are doing you are my role model! ✨✨🦋🦋
Congratulations Sister!!! Its is absolutely beautiful..
Name: Ashley Lopez Age: 18 Location: Inglewood, CA  If I were to win $20,000 I would use it towards my college tuition and my family. My family and I are super blessed to have what we have but we definitely could use the money for some extra help.  GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE 🤍 LOVE YOU SISTER
Congratulations James🌻🌻🌻🌻 Your truly a young gentleman.  And your style is coming together nicely here. Great job Sister!!❤
Makayla Harper Age:25  Instagram: makaylaspring_   If I’m lucky enough to win I would put it away for my future. Honestly being 25 I’m in the middle of what I want to do with my life and where I need to be. It’s a constant pull to do great things, have stability, should I have children? Maybe get married.... idk and that’s okay. But as each day passes I hope all the little victories add up so I can eventually be the woman I want to be. The money would help me buy a home one day, maybe college funds for my future children, the possibilities are endless. I appreciate that you are even doing this giveaway. This is awesome.
Beautiful home. Stay blessed 𝒮𝒾𝓈𝓉𝑒𝓇 James! 🥰🥰
HIS BATHROOM AND CLOSET IS BIGGER THAN MY ROOM
It’s for my sister who is struggling rn and has a baby and she need to buy stuff for what the baby needs it would help a lot thank you god bless everyone good luck
Your house is beautiful!!! Congrats!!!
my name is libby schwartz i’m 13 years old i live in MA, United States and if i won i would use this money to help my parents and grandparents. my grandma and grandpa are being kicked out of their house and they need some where to live but don’t have enough money to buy a house, it would mean the world if i surprised them with this money
I had to re watch the frist house tour to remember what it looked like 😅🏡

So you sure you said i can live with you? 🐻
Stay blessed sister 💖💖
I’m happy for James but y’all keep buying Jenna marbles McMansions...I mean do you but you didn’t renovate lol
I genuinely like this house. Sure it is huge and too much house for me, but the interior design is very tasteful and well done. Oftentimes mansions have decor that looks like it is for old people, but this one is so modern and fresh. Cool
I thought he said 20 billion followers -.- (i actually checked)
His house is so  AESTHETIC and beautiful 😍

Izabella Laniewski 16 Illinois, United states insta: @izabella.laniewski snapchat @krizaiza  twitter @izabellalaniew1 tiktok: @izabellalaniewski  If i were to receive the $20,000 i would put aside $10,000 for College and Rent for my parents if needed and with the remainder of money i would use it to buy a Camera and all other equipment for making youtube videos since it’s something i want to start doing to gain confidence and just try and make people happy and put a smile on their face. I would also love to go into photography so i would buy the items necessary to help me :) i love you and your videos so much. i’m always so excited when you post because i get to watch one of my favorite youtube do something that they love and we’re able to pursue at a young age. i hope i win just so i could give back to my family and help myself pursue what i want to do in life :))
This looks like Rebecca zamolo house

Name : Brittany Age : 25  Location : Jenks, Oklahoma Instagram : velostergirl0718 TikTok : velostergirl0718 Twitter: bhickman1994 How I would use the $20,000.00  I would use the 20k to pay off the rest of my college debt. I’ve been going to college on and off. I took breaks when I had my children so I could be there the first 4 months after they were born. Pay my rent off until January 2021. I then, would use some of the money to buy a bigger family vehicular for my family of four. Pay off our late bills. Get our baby a bigger car seat, his poor little feet are hanging off and they could get hung up on something and get hurt. I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself for that. Any money I have left from that, I would put back and save the rest. My husband works full time and I stay home with our two children full time because we can’t afford daycare or a baby sitter. We are already barely making ends meet as it is, and get behind on bills. Grocery shopping is a pick and choose of what we HAVE TO HAVE. We can’t even buy stuff for our children. We have a diaper bundle for our baby and that’s it. We are lucky to get a month taken care of at a time, and HelloBello is the best ever! I drive a tiny sports car with three doors and I have a three-year-old and a six-month-old. I got the 2012 sports car with three doors well before we got pregnant with our daughter. The car has been backed into, and a couple other things. The air conditioning in it barley works and gets hot very easy. It isn’t healthy for our baby, yet our three year old. We sweat when we drive, and it’s just a huge problem. Our kids aren’t comfortable. We can’t afford to fix it. We just want a bigger vehicle. It’s so hard to maneuver two kids and pack our family into a tiny car and hope that we get all of our belongings together when we go to family events. Then sometimes, I can’t pack it and leave it at home hoping we don’t need it. Sometime we do need the things we left at home but then again if we had a bigger vehicle we wouldn’t have to worry about it. We have been praying for financial stability for several months now, and we’ve barley been making it. Our three year old is fed, and happy. Our baby is fully breastfed so we don’t have to buy formula, and that’s really expensive. My family has supplied our kids with most of their clothes and our friends have given us the things they used for their children, who all all grown up and 7 or older. Since our daughter has been born, we’ve only gone on three dates alone. One, to celebrate our four years being together and two, was the night before our son was born. The 20k will  help us out more than you will ever know, and we would love to help out our family who has given us most of our children’s things and at least return the favor in a small way if we can.  If you ever read this, thank you for taking the time out of your day to do so. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to write how I would use the 20k. Much love James Charles, from Brittany and family 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦💜💙
I would spend 20,000 dollars to help my mom we are loseing money. So it would be great
His house is SO my aesthetic 😍
okkkk
when his dog has a better life than me

GAMING WITH JAMES YES
My name is Gerri Stiltner.  27. My IG handle is _gerriwoods_ Twitter GStil Snapchat gstil Facebook Gerri Woods   You  are such a beautiful human being, first off. Your home is amazing 💜 Winning $20,000 would be a perfect start for a down payment on my babies a forever home. It is my goal to give them what I never had. We currently rent and do not live in the best neighborhood in Louisville, KY. Shootings happen daily. My husband works basically to pay bills. He gave up his dream to take care of us, all while I stay home with our littles. I would love to win this to give back to him and to give my kids a happy, and safe life. They deserve it more than anyone could ever imagine.
Miriam Moreno  22  Las Vegas, Nevada  Insta : miriam_611 : Twitter : __miriaam__ snap :miriam615 & TikTok : miriam_611  First of all with 20,000 I will give my mom half because she literally deserves everything in the world she has been working 6-8 jobs since me and my other 3 siblings were born she literally works 5 7 different jobs every week , side job she started doing eyelashes to get a little more money to give us what we need . Especially with my sister we just went through some tough time with her . She’s 16 had an abusive boyfriend and my mom had no clue about it . It just ended sooo bad . I would seriously appreciate this and would love to give back to my mom as much as she does ❤️  With the other half I would buy me a car , I need a car because I have a 3 year old the car I have has no AC and if you live in Vegas or been here during the summer you know how bad it is to be with no AC 😭 I don’t mind using it for work but to drive around with my kid is horrible 😭 seriously would appreciate this with everything 😭❤️
My dream house
The actual name for the second living area. Is the Great Room... thanks for making sure the actual living room didn’t have a TV, it takes away from its real purpose..... 🤫
I hope I win ♥️ I plan to use the 20k for both business and personal ✨ I want to buy a house and turn it into a group home for children/young adults with autism to give some of them a good home and get them out of the system. 🧚🏼‍♀️ Kae Li 26 @ExoticDaydream
Amia Bynum 16, 17 on August 31 California, United states Insta: amiaian What I would do with 20,000 I would buy myself a car,  provide for my family and maybe learn how to wigs and eyelashes to kick start a small business with my learnings.

Name: Lea Toshiye Age: 29 Location: Dallas, TX ig: @lea_toshiye If I were lucky enough to win, I would use the money to finally start my online clothing line! Of course, I could buy clothing from overseas, make a site, & sell it (not knocking anyone who has done that btw! Totally respect it!), however, I want to design & create inclusive, quality clothing that I love and that I think other people would love too! I’m also a taller girl so I dream of making clothing that includes longer inseams & lengths so that we can find clothes that fits properly too, while still including everyone’s different size & shapes. I currently have a job but not a career. I’ve let fear and lack of resources stop me from following my dreams and doing something I love for a living. I turn 30 this year and I don’t want to wait anymore. I want to live my life to the fullest and be the successful entrepreneur that I know I can be! 💗 thank you for the opportunity, James! I’m a HUGE fan 🤍
Omg it almost looks like Rebecca Zamolo‘s house

Name: Jasmine Spencer Age: 27 Location: Annapolis, MD Social: Jspencer1770 Why: Hi James! I hope you and everyone are doing well! If I were to win the money, I would use some of it to pay off my debt such as my student loans. I would like to put myself in a better financial position to succeed in life with other side interests I have like creating a YouTube channel. I am also relocating for work and would like to be able to decorate my own new house as beautiful as you have done yours. Thanks for the opportunity!
Congratulations on your new house James! You deserve it! I hope lots of new memories happen :)
JAMES make some room! I’m moving in
Dorothy Aurelio | 26 | @dorotheaurelio I was never one to say money will fix everything, but it definitely can help towards personal growth if you use it wisely. If I had 20K, well i’d invest in a trainer and anything health related. I believe that being physically healthy would lead towards a healthy mindset.   That money would bring me one step closer to being the person I always potentially could’ve been. I would be Confident. I would be able to see myself in the mirror and say “Wow, that’s me... and i’m beautiful.” So that I can love myself enough to be able to love others. So there’s no room for jealousy, because I actually love who I am.   I know that sounds so dramatic... but, that’s what i’d do with 20k extra in my life. Invest in myself (physically), don’t think I can go wrong with that. Once I invest in it, hopefully people can see 3x my worth.
Whoops not in America :( but still gonna keep this up  I'm going to just tell you the reason why I should get the 100,000 dollars... Ok so me and my family are not very rich we live in Australia and we don't have a bought house yet because of this. Me and my sister along with our parents rent a house about 200 square metres (which is smaller than it looks) and my parents have been trying to buy q house for awhile now (the truth is we have never actually owned a house) so this would be a perfect amount to atleast buy the house and start paying it off and thats really it except for the exception of me making my own channel which I've had set on my mind since I was little but I would still rather help out my family fist and then do whatever my heart wants. 💖
Damn i'm so JEALOUS.
WAIT 100K JAMES YOUR KIDDING??? I KNEW YOU WERE RICH BUT NOT KARDASHIAN MODE SISTER WHATTT!!!
Love It so much!!!! luv you too!!
Name: Natalie Klusman Age: 21 IG: @natalieklusman Why?: I am in the process of applying to law school. Unfortunately, it is very expensive but it has always been a dream of mine to help other people, just like you do everyday! I want to be able to attend but due to expenses, I am not particularly sure it'll be something I am able to do. Winning this sum of money would enable me to reach my goal of attending law school and then being able to repay my family in the future for everything they have done for me! Thanks for the opportunity of this giveaway.
im so sad that he didn't have the piano that grayson gave him
Wow
Felisa Juliette  18  Texas, United States Insta: felisajuliette I would save up the money for college❤️ I want to become a doctor someday☺️ By the way I love all your videos I’ve been watching you since 2016😍 you’re my favorite YouTuber!!!🥰
Sadie Moore 16  Sallymoore04 Texas I would buy a car and pay off the college classes I’m currently taking
Beautiful house
I'm a culinary/baking student and I would love to work for James in his kitchen and be his personal chef/butler.  That would be amazing!  (But we all know that would never happen in a million years XD)
From 20 million to 21.3 in 3 days. Nicely done.
James : "all that matter is of you know how to play the classics"  Also James : breaks out thousand miles on the piano
Hi Sisters, if I win the $20,000 I'm moving my family to Canada 🇨🇦   Love your new home.   Congrats on 20million xoxo😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
“Shayz lounger, look at me being a furniture expert!”  Lol James that’s not what it’s called. Most people will call them a “shez - lounge” but if you wanna be technical, enough to call yourself a furniture expert at least, “shez long”
I would use this 20,000 to get myself started on a startup with investments around me. Genesis
It looks so much like the other house that he haddd
james is currently living in my dream house. wow
If I were to win I plan to move and start my dream business in cosmetology. I feel A lot of people get discouraged sometimes because there are so many amazing cosmetologist or just people in that line of work some feel like they could never be as good as them or just feel put down. I want to invest in a building where I can incorporate all the beauty and glam but still offering classes on self love and and what it means to reach for your goals you set out for yourself. This was so inspiring and i hope I’m luck enough to win the opportunity. Name: Dionna :age 19: Instagram handle: nana_xbeauty

Stunning design
My name: Diamond Flores  Age: 20  Location: Houston Texas  Socials: Instagram: @Diamondaiko  Twitter: @Diamondaiko_   Hey sister James! First off I love you and been a sister since I discovered you on YouTube YEARS ago. What I would do with this money is first, help my bestfriend that tore all the ligaments in her knee out with her medical bills. She’s been stressing and everyday I try to find a way to help her out just a little. Second, my dream has always been to be my own boss and do a job I love like YouTube/ start my own business. So this money would really give me the jump to pursue that. I come from a family that wasn’t as lucky to have the finest things in life but we got by. I feel like I have to succeed in order to give back to my parents and grandparents that have worked their hardest to be able to give me all they could. So I hope you can consider me as a winner of this giveaway sister!! I love you!   Ps we need a new season of Instant Influencer!!!!! Me and my aunts would never miss a episode! You’re so good at everything you do. 💕💕💕💕
I will tell my kids about this man who created most of the happiness I have today,thank you so much James for my happiness from you since quarantine I have been quite sad because of not being able to play with friends outside and everything,you are like my online therapist and best friend.Stay well sister!
So beautiful!

Name: Marbelyn Benavides Age: 18 Location: Connecticut Insta: marbelyn125 Snapchat: marbelyn_5  Tiktok:mb.0503  If I won $20,000 I would help my mom buy a new car that she has been trying to get because the one she has now has broken down multiple times and has had countless repairs. She is one of the most hardworking people I know and I would love to give her something she definitely deserves.💛
I want to be as successful as James at 21 years old 🥺🥺

I’m 25, had my babies 18months apart. Love them ofc but wasn’t able to save and get my bag as I wanted to before hand, so pretty much would love to win for a new home. I’m obsessed with makeup and you. So thank you for your positivity and I’m happy for whoever wins. ❣️💕   And p.s I don’t have a Snapchat or twitter. Hope that doesn’t effect anything for me.

If I won this money I would use it to start up my own photography business. Photography is something that means a lot to me. Whenever I’m feeling down I go walks and take photos which helps me feel better. I would love to have my own gallery in my home town Kirkcudbright selling my photographs, it’s my goal in life to do this one day. I love seeing other people happy and I feel that photographs are a big part of people’s happiness as it reminds them of memories that mean a lot to them. Sorry for rambling on. I think this is an amazing thing you are doing. I love you James❤️

I know have the skills to execute the bench work, and this money would go to a really really important cause that I am deeply passionate about! My instagram is @steezyameez, my twitter is @ameliakschmidt and I am 22! The youngest by far in my class of PhD students at University of Montana. xx -A

Hi SISTER!! 👋🏼 my name is Monica my insta is monica_mrssunshine I’m 26 and if I’m lucky enough to win I would use the money to buy what my 3 kids need. One is 7yrs old, 1yrs old and a 1 month old. It would also help me get ahead on my mortgage and car insurance. That money would help so much! Thank you for being so kind always 💕 good luck everyone!!
Alex Brown 21 New Jersey Insta: ajbking_ Tbh Jamir Charlie this money will really change my life I work 130+ as a direct support professional with adults with autism every 2 weeks just to pay rent and my car payment. And a bitch is worn tf out. don’t get me wrong I truly love what I do but   I’m only working so much because I’m saving up to purchase my own fixer up to start creating different sources of income so Eventually I wouldn’t have to break my back and continue doing what I live to do.
If James was selling me a house I wouldn’t even hesitate
If I won the money.. which most likely won’t happen.. but it’s worth a shot, I would 100 percent help my mom with whatever she needs and try to get out of my living situation.. I’d probably pay James 50k to FaceTime me lol
EMILY ROMERO i love you so much james you encourage me to follow my dreams and that i can make them happen i loce you so much you are so funny and nice a sister snatched as always and you inspire me to make my own youtube channle thank you💕💓💖💘💞🌻☀❤💗💛💙💜💚
this is what my dreams are made of! congrats!
I'm obsessed with your home ❤️ well deserved. Love ya sister! I'm 27 and busting my butt to pay down my rescue dog's vet bills (he was paralyzed in China and has had multiple surgeries since, @joereinvented on Instagram). After that, I have about 20k in school debt to pay off so that I can start to save for a downpayment on a house. Praying I might win a giveaway or even get noticed by someone as blessed and kind as yourself, so that I can continue to help my pup and get a place to call our own and move out of my dad's basement before I'm 30 😔
I...I would get lost in your house....

Rebecca Lemi 19  instagram: @cherbum twitter: @becsitos  snapchat: b920a tiktok: @becsito  If I win $20,000 I would freak out like even the thought of that is mind boggling!!!! I would use some of it to finish building my first streaming set up for Twitch because it has always been a goal of mine to start streaming properly, facecam and all! (Right now I’m streaming from an Xbox one that I share with my sister)  I would help my parents pay off their debts as well, this year has been hard on them and I wanna do everything I can to help them out. The last thing that I would do is fix my car that has a dead battery lol and get new tags for it. As for the leftover money, right into savings!!!!!!!
I thought his favorite drink would be sister cola

Shaelynn Parfait 15 Cleveland, MS, United States Insta: @shaeparfait Twitter:@min_shae_kookie I would use this money to help my family move to Indiana. We have been wanting to for so long and with this money it would help us alot. Most of our family lives there and we hate having to drive for so long to get there. So if I were to win $20,000, I would use it to help us move closer to our family.

Name: Victoria Thompson  Age: 21 Location: Queens, New York Instagram: _tamii_tt What would I do with the money? One thing for sure I know I would do with the money is definitely pay off my student loan. I was recently in college but I had to drop out because I didn’t have the money or help to continue to go so I had to stop, and the loans I’d took out for the first 2 years being in college caught up on me (not good😕) and after paying that debt I’d definitely go back to finish and get that degree, and invest some of the money.
Alexis Bealer  19 New York, United States I am currently a sophomore at SUNY Binghamton university. And plan to become an NP which will require many more years of schooling. As you know college loans add up very quickly. If I were to get the 20,000 I would start to pay off my loans so there is less of a burden as I get further along in my career. Thank you for being so humble and enthusiastic, your videos can really cheer me up!
Siona Vellurattil 21 California, United States  Insta: siona_oxox
Wowwww
Michael Osborne Houston, Texas 19 years old hehe Why: If i were to be one of the winner’s picked, I would use half of it to put towards my college tuition and paying off student loans. I am a student worker and have to walk everywhere, so I would also purchase a car to make getting around easier. I would put the rest in a savings so when I do graduate and get out into the world, I’ll have something to get on my feet with! (Housing, food, amenities, etc.) Ig: ultmichael ☺️🙏🏾
PLEASE do Games with James omggg
21 years old!! Dallas, Texas :) Instagram: dakotajuarez Youtube:katiejane Twitter:dakotajjuarez TickTock: dakotajuarez95 What I would do with the money: I would finally start my business! I've always wanted to have a bakery for all my life. I love eating sweets all day everyday. I would call my bakery "Around the World Treats" because I would have traditional (breads, pastries, etc.) from different countries. The reason why I want to do this is because; not everyone has the time or money to go to different countries. So I would like to bring flavors from different countries for people to try and enjoy. Also once I gain the confidence I would film videos on how to make these bake goods that I know. I just love bringing joy and knowledge to people. And having a YouTube channel allows me to express that. But having a bakery I get to meet different people and help them in any why I can. Even if its a smile once they take a bite of my baked goods or someone to listen to you. I'm also someone who teaches self love. I'm a big believer in treating oneself right in order to live a happy life. Any one who knows me will tell you that. And I would really love to help people come to love themselves; by simply watching my youtube channel.

Fr tho what’s happened to James’ brother
i might have accidentally submitted my comment without putting my ig handle... but if you do see this comment, i basically said i would use the money to get as far away from my homophobic family as possible and that whoever did get the money, i hope will use it wisely! ig: l.bil1s

Name: Tayla Shahid Age: 19  Location: Sutton, West Virginia  Why: ever since i’ve been a child, i’ve always lived in poverty. there was a point where my parents couldn’t afford to put electricity or water in our home. we lived without for 6 months. in 2017, i accidentally got pregnant. i got married and my child is now almost 2. we are still living in poverty. me, my husband, and daughter live in trailer that is fixed enough for living, but still not fixed completely. If i were to win, I would pay off our debts and put a significant down payment on a house, because i want my daughter to have better. I want to have a house she can grow up in and we can finally live at least somewhat comfortably. after paying off debts and putting a down payment, i would pay for repairs on my parents house. their house has so many issues and they have no way to fix them. My parents are still raising two of my younger siblings and I would love to be able to help them afford things to get their house in better condition. Thank you for making this contest even an option. Im sending my best wishes to whoever does win ❤️  IG: thatonechick

james when last did you see your brother
Casper Desean 22 Covington, Georgia (United States) Insta:Casper.Desean TikTok:CasperDesean YT: Casper Desean Snapchat: RomanCasperX  What I would with that money is invest into building a YouTube studio somewhat like yours because I want to take YouTube very seriously and become a big influencer so I can start a foundation to raise money for my little brother who last away because it really brought down and set my family back he was only 3 years old and I didn’t have much time to spend time with him and I’ve been a huge fan of yours for a very long time and I don’t even do make up but you inspired me to be myself 🥺❤️.  Even if I don’t win I will be happy just know you you’ve noticed me even if it’s for a few seconds
Name: Barbara Burnett  Age: 19 Location: Ohio  Social media: I only have Facebook and YouTube 🥺 Why: I was forced to move out on my own after surviving a physically and sexually abusive home.

He tries too hard. Just bragging. Not humble at all. Pure cringe. Leave it up to James.
Name: Grace Location: Los Angeles, CA Age: 21 IG: grace_mellor Why: I could use this money to help pay my student loans as well as pay for my medical school loans. I want to become a doctor in underserved areas so I can help those without access to good healthcare! I really hope you choose me so I can follow these dreams and pay off my loans! I graduate this year and it would be a huge help for me to work towards my career goal! Thank you and congratulations on your beautiful house James❤️
Name:𝗘𝗹𝗹𝗮 𝗺𝗰𝗖𝗹𝗮𝗶𝗻 Age:12 Location: Michigan If I won the giveaway I would give some to my friend who is financially struggling and I would buy some clothes for school then I would save the rest to go on a trip to Europe later. Me and my grandma love watching your videos and I would be amazing if I won I guess that’s it.
I hope one day I’ll be this successful. But hi James congrats on the new house. My name is madison i’m 17 and Im from Los Ángeles. What I would do with the money if I’m even lucky enough to be one of the five winners is honestly a lot. First off I would take only 1,000 to get a camera and computer to pursue my YouTube career and for school. And with the rest of the money I would give it my grandma and uncle for a down payment on a house. Why i choose to give them the money is because they’ve been wanting a house for the longest but don’t have much money. They’ve both raised me since I was smaller and when both my parents left me. It would be so important to me to be able to help them since they’ve been my 1 supporters. My grandma loves you and always watches your videos with me. This would mean everything to me and my family.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  My Instagram is @mmadison.mua My snap is @maddeyfernandez  And my TikTok is @itzmmadisonnn
Pleaseeee bring back games with James 🥺🥺🥺🥺

Lyra basa 31 New jersey, US Pay for my cousins schools tuition, start my own small business doesn’t have to be huge just enough, set a side enough money for my wedding, buy my mom her dream gift, and donate to covid19 affected individuals in Ph.

But I would like to make most of it. 😊
Done followed on everything!!!
I love your house it’s beautiful 😍

If i was given $100,000 i would use $20,000 for school tuition. Im 19 and live alone and work full time yet cant afford to go to school.  I dont have a family to support me, ive been on my own since 16 and i came out to my parents.  Going to school to study psychology is my dream. I would also donate $20,000 to a charity that helps other teens in the same shoes, who have been put out or rejected by their families and are struggling like i did.  Thank you for your consideration🙏❤️❤️  Love you James!!!!❤️❤️

games with james come back
Alejandra Tamayo  Cádiz, Spain Insta, Twitter and TikTok: aletamayo21  With the 20,000 I would pay my university degree and I would help my parents and my grandmother with the bills and maybe I could save some money to gift them a trip to Paris when everything goes back to normal, because my mum and grandma always talk about what a beautiful city it is and how much they would love to go there and visit it.   After that, I would love to say that I think you're amazing and you really care about your fans. You have a beautiful home that you bought with your hardwork and eagerness you have for beauty and make up. You're doing a great job out there encouraging people to be what they want to be without caring about what others may say or think, and above all you are an amazing makeup artist. Thank you so much for everything James 🖤
I’m sister shooketh at how beautiful this house is. Imma go watch the other video now because I’m dying to see the rest. I’m so happy for you James!

Name:Paloma Singh Age:22 Insta:palogaldino  Hi james, your such an amazing human being for always trying to give back to your fans and thank you for blessing that lucky person to win this give away. I am currently in nursing school and if I was privileged enough to win I would use that money to help my family back home and pay my school debts off, I currently have 2 loans and its overwhelming,  sometimes I feel like giving up but I'm hanging in here for a miracle. Recently my grandpa had surgery and lost his leg and he was the sole person with an income now my family is really struggling and I have alot of responsibilities on my should to help them and pay my way through school. It can be very frustrating since I am so far away from them and i can nearly help with basic bills every month, this give away will be a blessing. I hope that you can read this and I know that many people are in need but I know you will make someone happy with your kindness. ❤

Elsie Boueche 20 San Jose, CA.    If I were to win the $100,000 it would help me achieve my goal of buying a home. I have 2 big dogs that I adopted about 1 year ago, I couldn’t leave them in the situation they were in. I live in a 3 bedroom home with my parents and 7 other siblings. My parents home is very small and everyone complains about my dogs being there, so winning this money will help my boyfriend and I have our own space that our dogs can roam in freely and finally have a backyard of their own. Paying off college and everything else is so stressful and this would be life changing.. You’re amazing for doing this giveaway.. you’re going to change someone’s life.
Ñame : Samantha rosales  Age : 21  Sacramento, California  Ig :saammmyyyy___ I would love to win ! It would be perfect for my little family to finally get our own house ! And use that money has a Down payment !

I also want to use it for buying dog cages for our 3 dogs for them to provide a normal house. And if there's some left, i'll just keep it for our emergency needs/purposes. We really need money right now for our foods and medicine purposes. Thank you in advance and GodBless. From the Philippines to You.  -IG: @allisa.98 -age: 21y/o

Name: Kaitlyn Horsley Instagram: @k8lyn.h Age: 19 From: Danville, Virginia. USA Why: I am entering this giveaway for two reasons. One is because I have been a longtime follower of James, and I love his positive attitude and his love for makeup. I myself love makeup and fashion and relate to James in many ways. (Thank you, Sister James, for being such a role model and for helping me through some of the hardest times of my life.) Two, I am a first-year college student in a middle-class family. My family makes too much money to receive financial aid for school, and not enough money to pay tuition without the help of loans. I would use the money to go towards paying for my education so that I can achieve my goals and dreams, just like James (except Sister James didn't need college, literal queen). My goal is to become a lawyer someday, which means a lot of hard work and commitment, also things I learned more about while watching James. Thank you so much to James and his team for the opportunity to win this amazing and generous prize.
Olivia inglis.  13  Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿  Insta : bertii73  I would help my family ..... it would help a lot I would also work on my makeup career ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Congratulations 🎉🎈🎊🍾
I love that you're giving back
Name: Olivia Caples Age: 29 Instagram: oliviaxcaples Location: California  HELLO SISTER!!!  First off, let me start by saying what an incredible opportunity!   I recently moved to a little town called Lemoore, CA, with my active duty husband. If I were to win the $20,000, I would give back to my husband. This man is an extremely hardworking human and deserves all good things. While I was in college working full time trying to pay my way through school without taking out an enormous amount of loans (which I still had too) my husband (BF at the time) who was making very little money would pay my bills, pay for my groceries and help out with school payments when he could. On top of driving four hours to visit me every weekend, I never once heard him complain or make me feel guilty for all he was providing. Not only does my husband help me, but he has also helped both of our families in times of need and always puts himself last. This fantastic prize would be my way of giving back to him, for whatever personal goals he may have. I could go on and on about how he deserves the world.   I love your channel and your positive vibes! Good luck, eveyone.   XOXO Olivia C.

The house is beautiful🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😱😱😱
Hi ☺️ My name is Nicole. I’m 21 years old, soon to be 22! and I live in NYC. The way I plan to use the $20k  wouldn’t even be for myself, I would use it to pay off my older brothers college debt. Him and I are literally the closest and I love him so much. I know you can relate on what it’s like to have such a close and dope relationship with your sibling and feeling the need to help them out whenever they are going through something. My brother who’s 27, went to a private college in which he received a partial scholarship. Once he graduated, he decided to enter the military and those were the hardest days for me when he was gone because I missed him so much and I always hoped nothing bad would happen to him. After a couple years and ending his contract, he decided to go back to school and study something he’s genuinely passionate about. He’s studying now, trying to get his bachelors, while balancing life, his relationship with his girlfriend and school. But regardless of him doing all these things for himself, he still has student loans from years ago that he’s still paying off till this day from when he first started college. And to me that sucks. It sucks that someone who is so hard working and so intelligent, still has to deal with the burden of being in debt and having that weight on your shoulders. Nothing  would make me more happier than to be able to do that for him and not only make him happy but see him happy and not having him think about where he’s going to get his next payment to pay off his loans. I wish you could meet him. He’s the sweetest, funniest and most intellectual person ever. (sounds like I’m talking about a boyfriend) 😭 but that’s just the type of relationship we have. We respect each other so much and I would love for him to have at least one less thing off of his shoulders. It would be a blessing to receive and I know that using that money on someone else to make their life better, makes me more grateful than using it on myself or on things that truly aren’t necessary. i love you and i hope you’re able to read this. congratulations on everything you’ve accomplished and you’re honestly an inspiration especially us being the same age. i love you James ❤️  My Instagram handle: indeliblesoul  Twitter (just in case): nicomaux
This is such a beautiful house.😍😍😍
ok but james's fit is sooo cute

Mia Redmond 22 Maryland, United States Insta: allthespiritualnamesaretaken When I get $20,000 I would first invest in my myself to become financially free.  I would start with my YouTube channel with (all high quality) ring lights, camera, editing software. Then I would invest in getting a Kangen Water machine so I can give me, my family and my community fresh high quality water, since tap water sucks and so does bottled water! Everyone deserves water that is clean and truly hydrates them!  I would also give $1,000 dollars to my parents for everything they have done for me.  I would invest my money in supporting ethically sourced local businesses and sustainable living such as,   to give back to the earth instead of taking. I would then invest in a website to create a blog to help others going through anything and need guidance to let them know they are not alone and share the sustainable life that I am living and how others can too, what business have great products that are all natural and beneficial! To help those see the light through their suffering. To help them find their inner peace through setting an example and investing in money smart and wisely! I want everyone to be financially free and abundant! I will also invest in making my own recipe book of all my favorite meals! I am adopted, so one day it would be a DREAM to travel back to India, I haven't been there since I was born and would love to visit there (once it is safe) I also would use a fraction of that money to help secure a place for myself for a while, while i work on what I WILL manifest into my life!!  I still live with my parents, so the goal as well, is to move out! my life's purpose is to help others, I would greatly appreciate this opportunity to be a tool to get closer to my vision.
YOUR TELLING ME THAT A 21 YEAR OLD BOUGHT THIS!?DAMN THATZ AWSOME

I'd also treat my mom and help get her a new place because she means the world to me and deserves so much more than she's been given. ❤️  Congrats on 20 million subs James! You have such a big heart and such a beautiful house! Good luck to everyone entering!
Hi James I am currently trying to turn on post notifications, but it says that your content is made for kids and I can not turn on notifications. 🤔
Play fall guys on games with James!
Proud of you james
Congratulations
Hi sister!!  My name is Alex Llocclla Manrique  Unfortunately YouTube is my only type of social media. 😢 I want to enter the giveaway. I don’t want the 100k but just 20k instead. The reason what I need this is because that the amount I owe to my student loans.  I have worked really hard to pay off my car and I am making the minimum payments on my loans. Having that heavy load gone, would be the greatest blessing I will ever get. I’m also saving money to buy my first house in just a few years. I know for a fact that it won’t be as majestic as your new place.   Thank you so much for taking the time to read my comment. I doubt you will ever read it with so many millions of them 😂😂  Cheers to chances 🍷
your house is beautiful! goals I'm going to have a house like this one day modern and organized!!
I love the house so much❤️❤️❤️
I don’t have snap but I follow the other places!! Kristen Poland , 26, from MO  and I’d use it to help pay off my current house so we can get one big enough for our family now that we had our last baby 🤍🤍🤍
James...I see you as the next Ryan Seacrest!
i LOVE that you have so much but you are still so humble

Hello, my name is jasmine I am 20 years old. My Instagram handle is : jazzy.c00 I am entering this giveaway because I would love to win this money and put it towards furthering my college education. I am currently in LPN school and once I am done I would like to further my career to a higher level nurse. There is such a big need for nurses expecially now. But it’s so hard for people to go to school with how expensive it is. I am currently paying $ 32,000 for lpn and to get my BSN It’ll cost me another 40k . That is what I would do with my money. Further my career would let me give my daughter a good and stable life and hopefully not have to worry about budgeting so much. Thank you for taking your time to read this❤️
Hi i am from Californian and it would be may payment for my new home. Thank you for doing this giveaway to help now that it's much needed. Love you sister💓💓💓
Maiyah Campbell 20 Sacramento Ca, United States  Insta @imaisenpai  What I would use the money is to put the money towards my small business (clothingline), I love business and creating new things through art. It what makes me happy and it’s a way to express my self with out anyones opinions. With the money I’ll be able to branch out and grow my business more too. I’ve sold a couple pieces here and there but with the money I can hopefully open up my own store. This is something I’ve been wanting to do for years and it is something I really love to do. I would be so grateful for this opportunity. Also if you want I will send you some merch too. Thanks for making my day with your videos your are the best.  - Proud sister mai.

I would use the money to improve my living situation and I would want to start my career in realty. There are a lot of realty start up fees when working for companies so it would be an amazing help. Also finally I am a trans man and have been wanting to get top surgery (gender affirming surgery) and as I havent been in a good place financially I would finally be able to look and feel how i want. Love you James and good luck to all the contestants ♡
The master bathroom is bigger than my room lol 😂😂😂
Hi Sister James! I think it’s amazing you’re doing this giveaway to give back to the very people who helped your success 🙏🏼 I hope to one day be able to be in a place to give back too, just have to keep working hard! As for what I’d do with $20,000 I’d really just put it all into school to finish my Bachelors in Bilingual Education. I want to one day present my diploma to my parents and thank them for all that they’ve done for me. At age 30 I feel more determined than ever to accomplish my goals and although at times I feel as if I’m falling behind I remember that life is not a competition but a journey that we all walk differently. I wish you good luck in all your endeavors and look forward to hearing music from you soon! 🎶 Much Love!   -Daisy Yaralissa 🌼 30, Pasadena, TX   IG: Daisyyt58  YT Channel: Daisy Yaralissa
I would use the giveaway money to pay off my student loans finally (I graduated in 2013 with $17k in debt and I’ve never missed one payment since but my debt is still at $16k.) Then maybe I could finally afford to buy my first home. My name is Alicia, and I’m 29 years old and would like a house but student loans make it impossible. I know it’s not very creative but it would allow me to do so much more with my life since loans are holding me back. My Instagram is liciaaaa12 ! My Twitter is zombievader12.
me: O_O James: This is my first house! me: im young but hes 21 HOW James: My friends come round sometimes me:i want your life :/ Also Well done James!!! I love your home so much! Want to live there so much! Ilysm!!
Your indeed successful at very young age.
I would use this money to buy myself a new wardrobe because I barely have any clothes and most of the clothes I have don’t really fit me. And I would also help my mom pay the rent because she never really has enough money to buy herself things because she is always paying for rent. Please don’t @ me for saying imma buy a new wardrobe because ik it sounds wrong but I’m serious. And maybe I could donate the rest to an animal shelter and help the homeless 😁
God bless your house
im not a subscriber or a huge fan, but i’m honestly so happy for him and his team, you can tell that they’ve worked incredibly hard for the things they have and james is genuinely loving his achievements. proud of you guys, great job!!!
Omg Yayyyyyyyyy

Erica karnes Age:22 going to be 23on the 16th Thatcher, Arizona We have a little girl and just had our baby boy 2 months ago so I would get us out of my tiny apartment and move into something bigger and well suited for our family and I would also try to get caught up on our car payments that we have fallen behind on because of  being out of work because of us being out on leave for the baby please please consider me❤️🙏🏡
Name: Jessica Bauman  Age: 22!  Location: New York, United States  Instagram 📸: jessie_mae1_   I never win these kinds of things, but I love ya so much so I figured why not try! Winning 20K would be sooo beyond helpful in chipping away at my college loan debt. Having one less bill to pay would mean a step closer to being financially independent so I can move out on my own, sorry mom love you but gotta blast! Even if I don’t win I appreciate that you give back to your community in any way you can❤️
Congratulations!  Your new home is beautiful!
The marble walls in the master bath ahhhhhhh

Supermom!! Thats what i would do. Give to my mom. 🦋👑🏡🏡💝🌈💸🗝
Is it just me or the doggie at 6:55 is so cute
I don’t think I ever looked at a house and the decor and said that it was my dream home, BUT LITERALLY THIS HOUSE IS MY DREAM HOME
First of all Congratulations on your new house, I’m so happy for you to be living out your dream in your dream house.  Name: Andrea Gomez  Age:19  Location: Las Cruces, New Mexico   If I were to be one of the lucky winners I would pay off school loans and just school in general so I could continue on to my second year of college pursuing my dream in Pediatrics. I would also pay off my grandma’s house she’s lived in the same house since her parents built it. And I want her to have just one less bill to worry about. Again congratulations James you deserve everything and more. IG: xo.aandrea
Cassie Jones Just turned 28 Also from the 518!  Snap- Captivatingchaos/cassieleejones  Insta- captivating.chaos Twitter- captiv8ingchaos Tiktok- Captivatingchaos  I would use the money to put a dent in my student loans.

Not very exciting but I'd love to make a better future for myself. Love the new house!
Hi sister! I'm Natalye Townsend and I'm almost 21 (one month away!) I would love to win the money to make a few different dreams of mine come true. First I would give some of the money to mine and my fiancé's families. Then I would buy our first home together and pay for our up coming wedding and honeymoon. After that I would put some in savings and use the rest to start my own wedding planning business/venue. This money would really be amazing! Fingers crossed and prayers sent. Congrats on the huge milestone! ♥️ Instagram: _nalia_   (UNDERSCOREnaliaUNDERSCORE) (the underscores aren't showing up in the comments lol)

If I were to win the money I would use it to put it towards college, a car, and eventually an apartment for when I move out. Being a teen can be quite stressful when it comes to money, and the money would really help with all the upcoming expenses I have. I really hope you’re able to see this sister!
Hannah Goodman 22 Mercer County, KY Hey, James!! I absolutely love you and your vids❤️ What I would do if I won, I would get the right equipment to start a youtube channel, get me a good reliable car, and use the rest of the money to help my family out❤️
Sandru Erika 20 Bucharest, Romania  Insta: sandruerika I would definitely buy a car 😄
I'm planning on using the money for college so I won't be in debt anymore and the rest I would probably save to get my career started

my dream to have a house like this in my lifetime lol and he’s just 21😭what
Ur house is stunning, I would love a house like that, it’s beautiful. If u ever need a houseguest give me a shout 😂😂😂 well done though, u deserve this beautiful house, u have worked ur butt off to achieve this, I’m so proud of u James, u have grown so much in the past year, I love to see it 💞💙💞
Emily Valdez  20 Missouri, United States  Insta: emily__valdez   I would definitely use the 20,000 toward school, it’s my freshman year of college, first gen 😫 and I am quickly realizing how expensive my 37 mile commute everyday is because I live at home with parents that try to help me as much as they can but being I have two younger brothers also one in school it’s hard. Plus I am not eligible for government help so everything I do comes out of pocket. Not only paying for gas more than usual but books, access codes, permits, extra things professors ask for it’s all so very overwhelming. I’m hoping I can be considered for the giveaway it would really de stress me in a time where I should be focused on my studies. Future RNBSN in the works 💛
Brody Jacksonville FL AGE 22 my social my yt channel

I would use the money to pay off debt and start my own makeup YouTube channel and help me get my tumbler cups a website to sell! I’m almost 23 years only and have a 8month old (our rainbow baby) and wanna be able to give him the room I’ve been dreaming of!

Hi James!💗💗💗My name is Marcella and I am 21 years old. I want to start off by saying you are such an inspiration to me being the same age and achieving so many of your goals. I’m currently a college student in Boston studying Business. This year has taught me a lot and the number one lesson is to go after your dreams while you can because life is too short. I have always wanted to pursue social media and build a platform. I would use the money to help buy equipment to get started! YouTube has inspired me in so many ways and I would love to do the same for others. I love traveling and seeing different parts of the world, butttt I’m a broke college student lol. Good luck to everyone entering!  Insta - marcella_natale
Ok
The dog @ 6:54 lol

INSPIRATIONAL
Did you redo the things Mr. Kate did? Or is this a new house? Sorry I’m out of the loop!
First off your house is amazing! You are so awesome for giving someone a huge break in life! If I were to receive 100k I would finally get to buy a home and move to North Carolina to live close to my mom! I live in Erie pa, I have been a GM at Tim hortons for 10 years and my fiance and I have a good life, but saving money to buy a house is hard. I am 28 years old and my biggest dream is to open a Dog Rescue, or at least becoming a part of one! Im sure there are a lot more people who need the money more then myself, but man I can only wish 💜 your awesome, thank you! @therese_konieczki_

He’s ballsy for having so much white furniture
Absulotly in love with your new home! Me and my boyfriend have just started renting out first flat as we can’t afford a house yet. So I definitely think the $20,000 would go towards a deposit on a house which I would love to renovate from scratch.  Hannah ward  Devon, United Kingdom  Insta: hannah_wardxox
His house It's like every house in studio city nothing special
Omg love your style
I wish I could be this successful but I probably won't be and I really want a good job but now I'm ranting. Good job with being really successful!
If i had 20,000 dollars that money would be going towards college so i am not in debt!
James shoulda been a real estate agent
You’re making me feel insecure about my house... I love it ❤️ So happy for you, James!💗 You’re making your dreams come through, and I love that for you!🥰

All I want to do is provide for my daughter and it’s been hard but I’ve been managing. Being one of the lucky 5 winners would be so amazing and such a blessing for us. We love you so much! She loves watching your videos with me💜 good luck y’all

Amber  England
Name: Alicia Carballo Insta: @alicia_carballo Age: 19 from Orange County, CA Growing up in Orange County as a minority with immigrant parents and little money was tough. At a young age I was involved in my parents messy financial battles and emotional trials. All I grew up knowing is how to pay bills, send them in the mail and set up lemonade stands to give my parents the money. I’ve graduated high school and started community college, financed entirely by myself. I still don’t have a car, which makes me have to use Uber or Lyft which can be pricey. I’d use your donation to buy myself a shitty car and help my mom out with her bills and get her farther in her life. I love her so much & I want her to retire fairly soon, she’s 57. Thank you James.
*cries in my nyc studio*
Wow is all I can say

When your house is so big you need a part two
I bet the coke cellar was more supposed to be a joke because of how everyone says he is so hyper it’s like he’s on coke 24/7
Wow your house is so lovely well done 🧡
Man, I don’t really care about makeup or anything like that. But I have been subbed for a while just for your personality and positivity. Super glad you got to buy this house, you deserve it!
I see hate comments on here about his living in a million dollar home James worked his as off n time of his day to day to get to where he’s made himself today so to everyone hating can get out Bc James is thriving n so happy from where he started n where he is now n for way more amazing things to come to him ❤️❤️

Hey James, I'm Saul and I'm 17, I know its a bit weird to try to enter when I'm 17, but I'd really like to win the money for my mom, she's taken care of me and my sister so much and has provided for us when she couldn't provide for herself. If I had the money I would give half to my mom to open up a bakery, which is her dream, and the other half to charity or to pay back anyone who has helped me or my family. My Instagram is @smh.for.no.reason and I really hope you give me the opportunity to make a difference in my life and others ❤

Can someone explain to me how these patios work when it rains...? Like I've always been confused on how people cover their outdoor couches everytime it rains
Ashley Bernados  @ashlowpancakes / @thebonqshop (Business) 17  $20,000 for a 17 year old may sound incredibly risky and irresponsible given the circumstances. However, I would use this money to further my sticker shop (@thebonqshop)! I would finally be able to buy a good quality printer and weatherproof sticker paper so that I can get give my customers the best experience possible when I ship them my products! Aside from this small business goal, I would also take this opportunity to help pay for my upcoming student and financial fees upon entering college after graduating high school. Living in California is very expensive, so I’d be immensely grateful for this opportunity to help thrive as an aspiring business artist, an incoming college student, and as an individual overall.   With that being said, I’ve never applied makeup to my face before! Buying the James Charles Morphe Palette has been a dream of mine. I’ve never had the confidence to glam myself, so I’d use what I have from the prize money to build my confidence and self esteem as a whole!   James, thank you for everything you’ve done to create such a loving and wholesome community. You are wholeheartedly generous and caring. I love you so much and I am thankful and blessed to be given the potential to win a fortune like this. You’re the best!
What i would do with 20.000$ is try to start some sort of brand especially clothes.it's my biggest dream but unfortunately I can't have Tiktok and Twitter but I want to participate anyway I hope I win  cross fingers from Denmark.
Dominique Ash  21  Florida, United States  Insta: dominiquee.raquel  Hi James, hopefully you see this ! If I were to win the $20,000, I would probably use it to help me start my own youtube channel by getting the right equipment that i’d need...like for starters a camera 😂 I mean there’s many things I can use it for maybe to even put down for my own place, which would help a lot so i can move out sometime soon ! Hope you see this xx Thanks for inspiring me always 🥰
this is a dream house
Omg! I love the style of his house. All the white, black, and browns is so sheek. I also love his videos and he has helped me with my makeup skills so much! Love you so much James!
Natalia Forte 20 Miami Florida insta - nataliabforte I would definitely pay off my student loans and buy some sister apparel 😍❤️❤️❤️ Love you james, congrats on 20 mil and your new gorgeous home✨You deserve it✨💖🥰
Would love that bathroom
The $20,000 would help so much! My name is Kaitlin Paulson and I am 18 currently living in yankton, South Dakota. With this money I would buy myself a car so I can get to work and school. With the rest I would put towards my college business marketing career! This would help so so much! My Instagram is @kaitlinpaulson   You have been such a great inspiration towards me ever since the beginning of your career, through everything you handled yourself with grace! Much love🥰
omg
I’m so shook at this place truly gorgeous 😭😭😭❤️

Thank you! Also love the house, so proud of you!!

hey james! I'll prob not get picked for the giveaway because of how young i am ( 13 ) but say i do win, i will help my parents with there store ( we work at a mini grocery store ) And because were redoing our name for the store we have lost our EBT (thats what people mostly pay with where my store is) So we have lost a lot of money. And because of that we really don't have money for school supplies (were doing online) so if i win i would mostly do those but my parents prob have way more stuff they need money for but they dont have so it would be my dream come true if i won that much money. love you james :)

Hi James! My Name is Grace Hang I am 19 years old, My YT channel is called HangwithGrace! If I won $20,000, I would use it to pay for my schooling. As of right now I am on a year break due to money shortage..and my parents of not accepting of the major I choose. I am an Asian American, and many Asian household families would want their child to major in the Health Care industry.. but unfortunately I don’t want to go through that route... my passion is Photography and Videography. I stood up for myself and told them that I want to pursue that and they were unhappy with my decision and decided to kick me out, I have been living in my car. So I took it upon myself to take a year off, get a job (I may need another job) and to save money so I could go to college for myself and hopefully get an apartment in the future. Thank you James for all that you have done. 💗💗,  you are definitely an inspiration ❤️. Here are my social media’s Instagram: gracehangg Twitter:Grace-Hang8 Snapchat: gracieisyourboo and unfortunately I do not have a tiktok 😞 I’m Sorry.
Your house is AMAZING 💖😍😊
I would use 20000 dollar for my YouTube career right now I have 8 subs in 1 month. Thank you James for inspiring me to do YouTube!

Maggie Lomas 20 Wisconsin, United States twitter: hiitsmaggs (i don't have instagram lol) hi james, first, i want to congratulate you on 20 million subscribers and your beautiful new home! it's so exciting and you deserve it so much! honestly, i've been really struggling to keep up with all my bills lately and if i won $20,000, i would use it to catch up with everything. i would love to make bigger payments on my car and maybe even pay off some of my student loans. it's so generous for you to do this and i appreciate it! love you, james!

My boyfriend and I share a really unreliable car and the winters in Canada are brutal.  I also wanted to say that I’ve never commented on one of your videos bc of my anxiety, but I wanted you to know that you’re an AMAZING creator, and you’re extremely humble. Please never stop making videos :) Im a subscriber for life!  I LOVE YOU❤️
I love that you’re finally so happy with your house now. It is so gorgeous and I love that you have spaces for your family and friends to hangout. I aspire to own a house like this!! 😍😍

Hi James and sister team, my name is Jasmyne and I’m currently a student studying exercise science in Columbus, Ohio. If given the opportunity to win $20,000, with your help - I would like to start a drug rehabilitation center in Columbus, Ohio. Back in 2018 my brother was shot and killed. He was addicted to drugs and couldn’t afford, nor find the help he needed to get better. I would like to be that help for other families struggling. Many rehab facilities will only house you if you have insurance or money to pay for your stay. The facilities only offer a certain amount of rooms and turn down hundreds of individuals everyday, simply because there’s no space. The people struggling with addiction is someone’s family member, these people deserve to have a second chance without worrying about how they can afford it. Even if I’m not chosen, I’m asking for your team to please take a look at this social issue and consider any options that can be made towards change.  My Instagram is Jasmyne_Holliday . Thank you for taking the time to read this, It is so greatly appreciated. Blessings jaz
Why is that bathroom bigger than my entire future? 😻 👁👄👁

Nirupama singh 35 Los Angeles, California  Insta: niru.03feb What will i do of this money? I just brought my 2nd baby to this world. I will save this money for both my kids college fund. 🙏🏽  Thank you so much Charles. Best wishes and  lots of blessings to you. 😙
Itzel Rios | 21 yrs. | @zelrios | Phx, AZ  With $20k I'll buy a $15 book about maximizing the $20k. With a business idea in the works and $20k, I need a strategy to distribute the funds and invest them into the business idea. When the business succeeds and a profit is made, that initial $20k will have come a long way, hopefully, more than quadrupled. Only then can I think about what I will check off my list of personal+family+community needs, the first being to buy another $15 book.  Thomas Jefferson once said, "never spend your money before you have it".
Hi sister,  I’m Jada Romulus  I am 21  I live in Seattle WA but go to school in NC  All social media platforms are @Jada_Romulus  if I were to win the 20k I would use it start up my non-profit determined to educate black youth on the law to prevent future social injustices. My birthday is September 1st, this would be an amazing gift.
Hey James,   I would first like to say that you are an inspiration as a content creator here. Your videos bring so much creativity and positivity to this platform. You are what every creator should strive to be! If I won the giveaway,  I would use the money to help pay for the rest of my college tuition and some of my medical school tuition. Becoming a doctor is not cheap! But I hope to get there someday, regardless of whether I win the giveaway. Anyways, keep doing what you're doing and don't let the haters get to you. I can't wait to see what you'll do next :)  Jacob Hatfield Insta: Jacobvhatfield 19 years old
Oh and my parents are in charge
My name is Dani Gledhill (IG: dani.gledhill) and I’m 19 years old. Having $20,000 would help me pay for my education so that I would be able to achieve the career of my dreams! Good luck to everyone entering in the giveaway!!!
If I win the 20,000 dollars I will help my parents pay their student loans donate some to charity buy a laptop for school and buy sisters merch. I am very thankful that James is doing this giveaway it means the world to me and being subscribed for so long and watching everyone of his videos. A lot  of people are struggling at this time and needing a job, so to whoever wins the prize pls make sure you help others and be kind.
IT LOOKS SO MUCH IN A BLOXBURG HOUSE
Hi James, first off I wanted to say congrats on 20 million and your new house you very much deserve it. The reason why and how I would use the money is because recently I have not been working and it's been hard to pay rent,food, and much more. I have a daughter and I want to give her the best I can as a single mom it's very difficult to give what you can to your child. With the money I want to buy a better home for me and her, and give her a better education during these tough times. My name is Anlly, my Instagram is moscosocaroli17 I am 34 and I hope you can help me out. Love you so much💗

Kaili Robinson 21 Liverpool, UK @kailimaree  With the money, I'd pay for a gym membership and  pay for my dance classes to help me get better and progress forward with my career in dance. I’d also buy a new irishdance dress as they are very expensive and my mum has been saving up and buying them up until now. I'd also take my mum on holiday and give to charity to help people and animals more in need  ❤️

Hey sister! I would love to win this amazing giveaway because it will help me and my family to get a house because we don’t have a house as yet we are living in an apartment which is not big because there is four of us.

If I was to win the 20,000 I would use it for college funds and to help my parents pay for many things needed in our lives my brother has autism and he wants to go to college and I think this money can help my parents pay for his college experience and better help his education I also feel the money can help my parents pay for medical bills  I would use also some of the money to go towards charity’s because I feelvery strongly to help others with this money and not be selfish and use it all on myself I do live in a nice home and my parents have good jobs so I would love the money but obviously if their is someone else who needs to more I hope they win and it would help them   Insta- gabriellapetrungaroo  Twitter-Gabriel44153903 Snap-gabbycheer09  Tik tok-gab.swag.queen I am 13  I’m from New York  And my parents know I am doing this

Hi my name is Abigail am 19 years old and will be turning 20 in September. I moved out of my parents home when I was 17. Since then I have pretty much been on my own. It has been difficult at times, but I keep a good spirit though all. I completed high school and I am currently a college student working towards a masters degree in education. I love to work with children and hope to take part in the educational field some day. I come from a family with no educational background I have watched my family struggle. My parents migrated to the U.S from Mexico so that my siblings and could have better opportunities then they did. They have always encouraged me to attend college I have worked very hard to get where I am today. I am the first in my family to work on a higher education. I financially support myself by working a part time job while attending school. If I were to receive the money I would would love to start my own business it is something I’ve always wanted to do. I would also love to buy a car as I was in a ver bad accident in March which left me with no vehicle. It would be a great help because I could finally have a car again to get me around instead of asking others for rides or ubering. I would also of course use the money to pay for my education. School has really only been my light though toughness and has kept me hopeful. I would also use the money to contribute to my savings so that I am able to get my own home in the near future.
I’m so proud of you sister ❤️

Is this just me or does this room give you Rebecca Zamolo house vibes?
Hi James! PLEASE READ MY STORY ❤️❤️❤️ I’ve been such a fan for a long time and I can’t help but recognize and admire how far you’ve come by yourself. You are so strong and made yourself to be so successful at such a young age. My name is Isabelle D (@izzydetrich) and I am 15 years old. It would seriously be a miracle if I recieved your help to start up one of my dreams! I’ve always had hobbies of being crafty and making my own things. I absolutely love the idea of making my own designs for people all sizes. I know I’m young, but I’ve always had the dream to start a clothing line with my older sister we have tried and failed numerous times with an old family sewing machine. We would love to start somewhere and potentially start a business together making beautiful fashion pieces that we love. At some point, when the business becomes successful for us, it would mean so so so much and I feel as if I owe my parents for all they have done for my 4 siblings and I. I would love for me to be able to repay them. And I have to start young because they had my twin brother and I late in their life. Thank you so much for taking your time to read my story. This would be an absolute dream and miracle all in one!! ❤️❤️❤️
Bring games with James back!!!!😫😫

In my non-study spear time, I'm looking forward to watching your videos to divert me from schoolwork. Helping people has always been my priority, and that's why I choose nursing. I'd need this money to pay for tuition, I'm already enrolled in the BSN nursing program, and I'm taking loans to pay for it. This will support me a lot, I love you and thank you for being such a beautiful person, after what you've been through. I loved the house tour and I am sending all positive energy your way while in this new journey.  It is the pool for me :*)
Hi Sister!!! I am Tawna, I am a 23, almost 24 year old. My birthday is in 4 days!!! I am from Ohio. my instagram handle is @tawnahope. If i were to win the 20,000 dollars i would pay off my student loans, donate to my favorite charity the Joyful Heart Foundation and A21. I would also use it to get a new car, mine has been totaled and i have been struggling to afford another one. Thanks so much for all you do and who you are. i love you the absolute most! 🦋
Hi James! PLEASE READ MY STORY ❤️❤️❤️ I’ve been such a fan for a long time and I can’t help but recognize and admire how far you’ve come by yourself. You are so strong and made yourself to be so successful at such a young age. My name is Isabelle D (@izzydetrich) and I am 15 years old. It would seriously be a miracle if I recieved your help to start up one of my dreams! I’ve always had hobbies of being crafty and making my own things. I absolutely love the idea of making my own designs for people all sizes. I know I’m young, but I’ve always had the dream to start a clothing line with my older sister we have tried and failed numerous times with an old family sewing machine. We would love to start somewhere and potentially start a business together making beautiful fashion pieces that we love. At some point, when the business becomes successful for us, it would mean so so so much and I feel as if I owe my parents for all they have done for my 4 siblings and I. I would love for me to be able to repay them. And I have to start young because they had my twin brother and I late in their life. Thank you so much for taking your time to read my story. This would be an absolute dream and miracle all in one!! ❤️❤️❤️
The way the house is decorated is so beautiful, the way the couches sit next to the window. so gorgeous and the Natrual Lighhtingg !
Good for you! Beautiful home, I hope you make great memories there in the years to come

Hi! I would love to enter the 20k giveaway. The reason why I would want to enter is mainly because my family is struggling with money and it would give us enough money to rent another apartment from where we live! My Instagram is sophia_robayo if anything. I really hope and pray I have a chance because my mom is really struggling with money right now. :( but good luck to everyone!

( It really is a tiny home) And get a car or put the rest in the bank & save it for rough times. But of course I would give my family some of the money. Because they deserve it too! I love you James! You inspire me so much & I'm so happy for you! Congratulations on your new house babe! 😍❤😘  Name- Erica Akins. IG handle- erica.j.morgan  (I have been married for 10 months now, but I haven't changed my last name yet.) And I would love to be able to finish my home before Christmas!

Literally so happy for you! This house is amazing. Congratulations James. You’ve worked hard and you definitely deserve it! 💕
HI JAMES, my name is Samantha Sykes and I am 31 years old. I would use the $20,000 for school. I'm planning on going back to get my MBA and teaching credential. It's always been my dream to be a teacher. The $20,000 would be able to lighten the financial burden of my Master's program and allow me to fulfill my dreams <3 @just_a_girlintheworld @samazon_89
I HOPE I CAN BUILD A HOUSE LIKE THIS ONE DAY WOW 😍😍😍  but hi james if you're reading this! im maiya (@paradiseless) on instagram! im moving into my first apartment and im so excited to finally have my own room to design!  i'm 20 years old and id use the $20,000 to help further pursue my passion for launching my personal business for  interior design + marketing!
This house is BEAUTIFUL WTF 😭😭😭😍😍😍
You are so cute James. And the only "beauty guru" I subscribe to. My niece is your age...she loves you! I would use the first 20000 to complete the upgrades I started in my house so that I could sell it. I dont need a home like this because it's just me!I would then pay back my parents for a loan they so selflessly gave me and use the rest of my money to pay for my niece to complete her schooling and help her move out to the city of her choice. You would love her! She lives with my parents, her grandparents. She left her mothers house right after she graduated because of the open drug use and other horrible things she had to witness for many years without any of us knowing. She deserves a chance. She really does. Thanks sweetheart!
I would love to use the money to help continue my education, and I'm 22! Insta handle: tia_skellington

Hi James and team members! My name is Ally Dube! I am 19 years old and trying to start my own life. I’m living in Missoula, Mt with my girlfriend (future wife) and our puppy and cat. We have been struggling to make rent and pay school bills. I have been on the search for the right job and it’s just not going great. With the prize money I would not only be able to afford rent for the both of us but I would be able to share with her all that she deserves. I would also be able to find the right job to further my business dreams and our family. This is my tiny family and they mean the absolute world to me. They are the reason I am doing this and they are the reason I’m happy in life. Thank you so much for reading! (I do not have an Instagram to put my insta handle but my snap is allydube6)
Hello James, first and foremost, congratulations on 20+ million and thank you so much for the opportunity.  I have recently become a commentary channel. I speak all the time about how becoming a content creator has been my dream since I was 17 years old. 8 years later, I am currently trying to get my life together. With 20,000 I will be able to fund my makeup line. I have already designed a palette, constructed a theme, chosen color names, picked out two possible distributors, I just have to save enough to pay for these items, licensing, materials, etc. I also wanted to create a side bar business where I can encourage plus size women to travel freely. Often times plus-sized women do not travel because of feeling out of place or worrying about causing other discomfort but I want to create an environment where that won't be a factor. My name is Miracle. I am 25 years old. Twitter: MindofaMiracle Instagram: Precarious_mind
love you james
This must be such an achievement especially at the age of 21 like what !!

You can make that wine cellar into a mini music studio....
LEFT ME ON A CLIFF HANGER
Sister James you definitely deserve this house, you have worked so hard to get here. LOVE U SOO MUCH SIS <3
I don't get it are u a boy or a girl

I love it so much it so aesthetic
When its like ur house 👁👄👁
😭❤️ I just love how sweet he is James is everything ok everything
Who clean these houses
Only 2 words:I’m jealous
I was about to say that, where's your studio? & james just revealed that he has a secret place in his house!
OOOO GURLLL THAT SCANDINAVIAN STYLE!😘
I LOVE HIS HOUSE SO MUCH!! Whic
Anyone else also a fan of Rebecca zamolo and think he lives in her neighbourhood bc they look very similar
This is like my dream house just less decorative and more lived in😂, it’s so amazing seeing how far he has come :)
so how can i win that money? I am trying to get through nursing school and I dont want to be in debt forever :((((  Maybe I can then afford a house 1/16 as good as yours
James i try to get iPhone 11. But I'm from another country. i stuck middle of the process the process. This always happens to me. Whenever i try participate but stuck in the middle of the process.
Hahahah
I hate to say this but this houses personality does not match his. He has a extrovert warm and bubbly personality. This house is decorated very boring.
This house doesn’t look lived in...
That schmoney smells like sister school tuition to me ❤️
Congratulations for your new house, you're so beautiful sister James  May God bless you n your new house 😍😘
Me and James have the same aesthetic and I'm kinda shook

James energy is what I need in my life!
Why oh why is he wearing shoes inside....and on the carpet 😂❤
Hello sir James  really good job
rude
Its such nice house james😍😍😘😘😘😘😘🤔🤔
To everyone reading this Jesus loves you so much that He died for you!! I pray you surrender to Him you’re so loved!!! If you want to know Jesus (feel like God is showing you this for a  reason and your feel convicted to pray this and know Him) pray this prayer or just cry out the the Lord admit you’re a sinner who needs a Savior! Tell Him you want to know Him! Just pray : dear God i ask that you would come into my heart forgive me of my sins and make me a NEW creation. I want to know you, please show yourself to me” i pray you turn from your sin and seek the Lord (reading the Bible, devotions, fasting, prayer, etc.) can’t wait to be in Heaven!!💖💖
Hi sister love your new home so fits you! who are you giving the money to?
In those white drawers he didn't show,I bet they are full of panties like at Victorias

Wow. So inspirational. I’m not much of a material kind of person. Name brand clothes, bags, shoes don’t do much for me. But a cozy beautiful nest to recharge in is definitely a goal of mine. Beautiful home, James! Congratulations! ☺️
Probably my favorite house tour I've seen! And I love when he plays piano! 💜
Wonder if you live near misseemiashten cuz her house layout is soooooooooo similar to your houre
"Here's my wine cellar, I don't drink wine." "Heres's my office, I don't use an office." "Heres's my kitchen, I don't cook."
Who cares
I’m so proud of you!! You are so dedicated to your work and to your sisters. You are an inspiration to be creative and start from scratch. Congratulations on your new home. 💓
If you choose me for the money it would mean so much to my familly we can barley get gas sometimes i have 6 siblings it would mean so much
james's house is bigger than my school and my house combined BTW love your videos a lot, they are making my quarantine much better

James really sounds like he’s a real estate agent trying to sell his house
To be honest, James' entire house is literally a pinterest board.
Everyone thinks that James Charles fans are ALL Americans, like this if you're not American.
can we talk about the fact James is only 21 years old and he owns the gorgeous house

i know i'm not the only one who is analyzing every single corner of his house for just checking if he still have the bench that ethan bought & also the piano that grayson bought for the dolan twins holiday collab video.

The whole house is beautiful but too pinterest for me
GORGEOUS!!!!

Love your house. Your house is beautiful.
James you really deserve this house I feel really happy for you
It is honestly so great to see that someone at just 21 can be so successful and accomplished. James you are the epitome of someone who works hard everyday and can conquer any obstacle that may come onto their path. I’ve been watching you since the beginning and I’m overjoyed at everything that you have accomplished and the fact that you are still you and that you haven’t let fame change you. Love you sister and I’m so happy that you got your house, can’t wait to see what else you have in store! 💙 xx

Hi james scan you do a makeup look inspired by back to school
omg I'm so happy for you James, you are my absolute  idol, juts amazing and very empowering
I’m not a frequent James watcher....but I’ve checked in from time to time .. and I have to say I’m really proud of James (: People see him do just makeup ... but it takes a lot of hard work and hustle to accomplish some wonderful things like this . May God continue to bless James , his health mentally spiritually physically and emotionally , and continue to grow to his best place .... I’m very proud . And sometimes ... that’s what people need to hear .. your doing a great job , keep working hard!
Wait, i kinda really need that money, my mom is very broke, and for the past years weve been struggling for years, and it would just be a huuuuge help please just give me a thought. I dont have to win, but just please let me cross your mind  thanks😊😊

His house is soo beautiful😍😍 I love it😍😍
you don't drink wine but your guests and friends might, no ?:) your home is beautiful, congrats
That us BEAUTIFUL James
So done with overpaid jobs. Like don't get me wrong, your house is gorgeous obviously and it's awesome that you can afford it. But here i am, 27 y/o, burned out because of work, living with my parents, struggling to find a place to live because even the tiniest place here is too expensive. And here you are, talking about your huge ass kitchen that you don't even use. Like, i love that for you, but this world is unfair man.
Geese my house is the same size as ur living room.......which one i dont know
dam beautiful house james
Beautiful home.
I LUVVVVV UR DOG JAMES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful house very earthy, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. :)
Me watching this in my closet sized bedroom: 😑

I love the simple things-white and black🤩🥰
In my house i have a piano, and i dont use it  😐
When James said what other interactions couldn’t see you later on in the shower  My Sims brain be like: shower whoohoo IRL?
I‘m sad that it’s not the piano that he got in the video with Emma and the twins (Christmas gifts)
Can someone tell me the brand of the two chairs in the living room? I can‘t find them online ..🥺
HES LOOKING SO FRESH AND LIKE AN INDEPENDENT PERSON FUDJSBDDJSJ IM SO HAPPY JAMESSS

Me wan100 dalaor
Omfg! James is giving away 100k????

Love your house✨
Wow! It’s really impressive to see how much James has grown, his house design really reflects his personality, like, down to earth and it’s just him. I remember watching your house tour when it was in an apartment space, I thought that looked awesome already. This house tour I think is just right, everything is accustomed to your taste and I can see it! Not too flashy but I think.. just right. Really homely and airy too, it doesn’t look too much.  And.. Aww the kitchen though! Literally everyone’s dream goal is to have a island in their kitchen, you’ve kinda got two! 😂  Although I don’t watch your videos whenever they’re out, I’m really happy for you for coming all this way, despite any hiccups along the way you’ve made it and I’m sure your family are very proud, we as viewers & other supporting fans are too! Keep up the amazing work, love to see you go even further! 😘☺️
I hope one day i can have my home too like you
I mf love james' outfit. The way it intertwines masculine and feminine, casual and formal- its immaculate
Make a lot of beauticians with Charlie D'amelio
He just called me poor in 83 different ways💀

When he showed the first room              :O  H O W xxx
the piano shouldn’t be right next to the fire place, those strings are going to be loosened quickly and damage the piano
This must be in the same neighborhood as jenna marbles because the layout is exactly the same
DESERVES IT AND A HALF
Hi James, I'm your biggest fan 😍😘 and I wonder if you could show us your makeup tools in your next video 🙃😊😇

Money is the root to all evil.         Repent brothers and sisters.  Open your eyes, turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that you may receive forgiveness of sins (acts 26 v 18). -  - The Son of Yahuah, Yahushua Hamashiac is the light of the world, the living waters. Believe He is the son of Yahuah (ancient Hebrew name for G-d) that He died for your sins and was raised to life on the third day so you may have eternal life. His sacrifice and shed blood made it possible for us to be with him . Seek him and live righteously by His word. Ask the Spirit of Truth to live in you which was given to us after he ascended. Ask him to open you eyes and fill you with everything that comes from Yah. Love one another.    36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?  37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.  38 This is the first and great commandment.  39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
It says TBC soo when is the next part comeing out 🥺✨💕
🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡

Not to be that person that misses Jenna Marbles, but the layout reminds me of her home! Other than that, the aesthetic and concept of this house is absolutely stunning.
I like in fact that the house is so clean and other yt :/ they not no offense
M from India
It’s the having 21.2 MILLION subscribers, but constantly saying 20 million for me 😂 haha
i love that his house still have a homey vibe and not like the “i’m rich and it’s just for show” vibe yk? it’s so pretty tho omg
sister james:the kitchen is the heart of the home         james 2 seconds later :i dont know how to cook i eat postmates everyday
Hiii jamess i luv u
Very nice sister so happy for u
Bruh James bathroom is the size of  my room or a little bigger
James house matches his personality so well. Absolutely stunning 😍
I would be so happy if I got that $100,000 because my uncle just had a stroke and he needs all the help he can get and I’ll buy myself some thing that’s very cheap then give the rest of the money to him and he can do what ever he wants with it😭😢
Definitely different than I thought but in a good way! It’s not just alot of empty space, is reasonable for all who’s living there and it’s beautiful!
Hi  I love your make up looks
James’ bedroom is bigger then my whole house ☺️
His bathroom is the size of my whole rental apartment 😂.
Wow thats so. Cool james congrats:) tysm sister LOL

For the master bedrooms patio what do u do if it rains tho...
Omgggggg this house is amazing
I cant believe he’s giving away so much money. You know how kind that is!! And me thinking we can finally afford more stuff if I won this is astronomical. Im so excited, except for the fact that I have a 0.001% chance of winning! I still love james and i wont give up hope. My wish is i get this money donate some to charity and give the rest to my mom to help her out!!🥰
Uuh actually it's 21 million!!!! Aaahhhh im so proud of youuuu
*hey sistrrrrrrr* I'm new hear lol sos

When AD doesn’t interview, James did his own home tour 👏🏽
When I saw james white couches  I was like, is he gonna leak through them, then I remember he's a guy he doesn't get period🤦🏻‍♀️
Every time you post a video I sing along to the intro🥺
i feel like this was kinda idk like a tiny bit rude to mr kate lol, cuz they designed his old house and james is talking ab how much he loves the design of his new house and how it was the most rewarding partnership hes ever had.
wait wait wait! this is the same house!? ummm i’m confused
This whole house screams Pinterest
He’s 21 with 21 subscribers

Love tour house ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍
Hi I’d really like $100000 to pay for college because I’m not good enough to be a youtuber.... so yeah
Love the intro😍
"to be continued..." what typa bull-
Holy shit I wonder if he knows $100,000 is the amount of most people make in 2-3 YEARS.. that’s insane!! I’m 29 and have 2 jobs to make $72000. I work an average of 55-65 hrs a week to make that. $100,000 is incredibly generous!!! Good luck everyone!!!!!

I won't breath into your replay 🌬🌬💨💨
Your house is decorated how id love to have mine but I’m just too poor to do so🤣 it feels so homey and comforting unlike so many famous people’s homes. They either try to use too luxurious of decor or hardly any
Hello Mr.James Charles can you pick me for the give away or can you show me how to do it my family only needs 4,000 dollars left on our house it would mean the would to me to get a new house I have had this house for my whole like but if you have to be fair I am ok with that but have a nice rest of your day
So nice to see James in such a good place in life, esp considering everything he's been through. Congrats on your beautiful house!  🤍
i like the tree in his room
James Charles, can you be my sister please?
😳
That is absolutely generous that you would give 100,000 to one of your subscribers. Honestly,  I am on a journey to pay off debt. I started 5 years ago and I'm half way there. This would pay my remaining debt and I would also have money left! That would be a blessing for sure!  Beautiful home James! Love you Sister!
Why does the beginning when james open the door is like 73 questions woth vogue??:)
Why is this dude dressed as a woman, does he want to be a woman? 🤮
James really did a good job touring his house. It's like he's trying to sell it😂
Tell me in the thumbnail his nose is flat as hell
James’s bathroom might actually be bigger than my room... but this house is so pretty omg I would love to live in a house like this😳
Beautiful!
Its a shit hole.
I love you James but you talk so fast when talking about your room at one point I got anxiety 😂❤️
Beautiful home!

Omg James it's amazing I'm glad I've been subscribed for so long I'm glad I help you get this far ❤️❤️
How do I enter
Congratulations on your beautiful home.
6:13 me: haven't you ever heard of an interior designer.   James: there are literally people whose job it is to organize your house.  🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Please do games w James PLEASE I WILL DIESESE

Such a beautiful home! Congratulations!
I love seeing James' vibes these days. Happy + slaying life!

Once again this would really be the most wanted decoration in my life, I love how this looks!!! It is so much better than one I have seen before.
The ugliest house tour I’ve seen in 2020
James: I can't read music *Proceeds to play the piano flawlessly* Me who's been playing for 7 years but can't play a piece without stopping: Sorry what?

LOVEDDD this video. Congrats on buying your first house🥳You really deserve this and even more. It’s so inspirational to see how far you’ve made it. I remember watching videos of you and Ian in your smaller apartment and now u bought yourself a beautiful mansion🤩 I only wish u more prosperity and success in ur life. Ik last year wasn’t the best year for u, but the fact that u came out of that adversity stronger and even more mature is all that matters. You got our support, and keep up the good work sister James 😊❤️ I can’t wait to watch another video in the years to come of a bigger and even prettier house (if that’s even possible😉)
Your home is so pretty
I know i dont have chance but ur beautiful ppl
Bruh his bathroom is as big as my bedroom
100.000$???!  Ok ur beautiful ppl
I cant afford a COKE, my moms house is falling apart because the owner built the plumbing wrong and she has my three sisters living with her, the landlord is making them move out in a little less than two months and they dont have money to do it, I moved out in an apartment alone to go to college and start my life but it's been really heard with money. Seeing people with there house all nice and pretty is so inspiring
I'm gonna copy the entire house when I earn money 😢
hi keep doing vides  so funny and cool pls answer

Its known that there are people who are able to fine or narrow down where you live by using floor plans/blueprint, etc. Home tours are cool but I would be more careful and not do it in a walk tour style.
I am getting some major Studio Mcgee vibes

You should sell houses IF makeup ever fails bc you point out all the good aspects and show off more of the aesthetic of the home while making more modern small talk also luv the outfit u look like a formal insta baddie😂
But only 1 person lives in his house no hate but someone had to say it Iy  james
Is it just me or does the first floor resemble Jenna Marbles' home layout very closely...
It's so impressive that a 21 year old bought this home, congratulations James 🏡❤️😊
Imagine getting bored in that house
It so big for 1 person
Wine closet more like ✨𝕮𝖔𝖐𝖊 𝖈𝖑𝖔𝖘𝖊𝖙✨

"personally i do not read music  but as long as you know how to play the classics it's all that matters" AND THEN STARTS PLAYING A THOUSAND MILES, I LOST IT

I love his closet!!!
OMFG🤯 it’s so pretty 😧 i love it😻😻😻
James is so professional, most YouTubers do house tours and everything is pretty random. But James’s house is so well put together
I feel like I just bought one of the most expensive houses in club roblox

James: looking for chandeliers The chandelier in his room: hey, buy me! Excuse me BUY ME James filming his house tour: this chandelier really just spoke to me     I know this isn’t funny, it sounded more funny in my head 😬

I love the house 🏠  and your so genuine 💕
I literally freak out if someone gives me 20 dollars, imagine having 100,000!! 🤭

I don’t watch James Charles so serious questions. I hear he keeps saying "We"; does he have a girlfriend or a roommate or something to live with?
You did the damn thing, love this house and how you have everything set up! It’s beautiful! 😍
4:41 please close the doors all the wayyyy!!! (ocd) Sorry.
I really love  your video's  i enjoy  them so much  UwU
Must be nice being rich and famous.  I'd give my right cube.. hell, both of my cubes to have just a fraction of his money due to a good job.. I'd give my 77 year old grandmother her own home... She's given me so much
the house is so beautiful
Your bathroom is the size of our house already. If I win this giveaway I would buy a house for my family❤ and still congrats you deserve it❤🧡💛💚💙💜

Dude i could use that money or even half of it to get a new car after it lost control on the road last Friday leaving it totalled 😪 My tires locked up on the left side so when trying to fix it from going in the grass as it did i pulled and it threw me into the other lane and when trying to fix that it threw me backwards and slammed into a tree Im also a beginning painter who has to have a car to travel for my job :/
Honestly, the closets look so pretty!

Time is short very short...  Our Lord Jesus Christ is coming back really soon... Accept him, with him comes eternal life securing that is extremely important... ..  For those who want to know Jesus Christ, my precious saviour say this salvation prayer out loud " Dear God I come to you a sinner I repent from the bottom of my heart please forgive me. Jesus, I believe that GOD raised you from death I make you Lord in my life baptize me with the fire of the Holy Spirit burn the chains that hold me captive to obeying you. I believe Jesus Christ you are the son of the living God please write my name in the book of life from today Jesus I make you LORD and saviour in my life guide and protect and teach me your word AMEN"  That's all next read the book of John & Hebrew u will know how precious Jesus Christ is he is amazing and waiting on you

JAMES I love the style of your house. It is so put together and the color scheme of the whole house fits. It has a mix of elegant and a hint of boho. The dark colors with hints of blues and raw wood is AMAZING. When I grow up I literally want my house to be so sophisticated like this and I want all the rooms to correspond with like certain colors and themes like yours. Ugh I LOVE it. Also I really love the chandeliers too haha! 💕💕
Congrats to you james you cane a long way im so happy for you i love how warm the house looks!

James kitchen is bigger than  my whole house !
10:50 FINN IS BACK AGAINNNNNN
He's still trying to find his own taste in home and decor, evidently. NOTHING in this house feels like him, nor does it represent his personality. I guess it's fine if he likes having that "home away from home" vibe, which is, of course, ironic because it's literally his house.
I’m sorry but the coke cellar is fucking hilarious 😂
Love your house
Congratulations! I am so happy for you.
My jaw dropped through all four floors of my building
James, you should that tik tok trend where your 15/16/17 year old self wakes up to your life now!
wait so did he rent his previous house tour?
6:55 FINNNNNNNN
All I have to say is:      G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S
Please do a mukbang in the new house
Fyi i am talking bout myself
The house is absolutely STUNNING 😍 There are a lot white mansions that all look the same but this one has a shittonne of character and life to it. Congrats, James 🙌
In many languages
This just says poor to me
imagine a game of hide and seek in his house
James is sexy and I'm a loser... got it lol
I 💜💜💜your house

I love ur house lol and can someone tell me what to do so I can 1%win the giveaway?
I want to see james playing games
BEAUTIFUL
Your home is a dream come true, well really your life in general is 😭😭
I think I've just witnessed the worst role model for young people ever. This lifestyle is not something to emulate children. This "guy" has already been embroiled in controversy, there will be more that'll will end his "career" and hopefully leave him penniless. The algorithm is behind his success not hard work or talent.
Love you
Am i the only one confused... I thought he owned his old house
How is he already 21 million
Excuse me, I’m just gonna make sure I heard this right. He said “1,000” right? I coulda sworn he said “100,000” 😂 that woulda been funny. Must’ve miss pronounced. 🤪
Idk why but this house's layout is kinda ALMOST the same as rebbeca zamolo's house
Beautiful Home James and I am very happy that you are happy with your home, Sends you Blessings
I love this house !!

I’m so proud of you James!!! The house is so beautiful!
Why are the houses in the USA so big?! ( you should really just for fun look on the internet for the houses in the Netherlands!)
I swear he speaks faster than Eminem rapping
James, I couldn't be happier for you, but I can't help but think of the pain keeping that clean would be. Still, worth every last but if it. This is phenomenal.
So sleek🙌🏼🙌🏼
Compare this house to jeffree's decor. Lmaooooo
he rich
when i heard the giveaway number, I made a face that was IMMEDIATELY matched by the emoji that followed.

i’ve peen playing the piano for 6 years and still aren’t able to buy a piano. must be good to be rich lmao
Awnn congratulations James🥺💅🏽
He lives right next to Logan Paul
Love your vids
Your house is absolutely elegant. The main use of browns, whites, and blacks (even gold accents) in each room give it a beautiful sense of simplicity. From the outside looking in, I truly think that if you add bold pops of color in each room; reds, oranges, yellows, blues etc etc...  Maybe even pastels would make your house look all the more inticing and alive. Pops of colors on your throw pillows, sheets, dishes, rugs, throw blankets etc etc. I guarantee it'll make you fall in love with that house even more.
did he really put coca colas instead of vines😂
Are you a girl????????
James can i live in your closet 🤩
James out here flexing his million dollar home while I'm skipping through 5 thrush ads. Please, enough midrolls boo

GAMES WITH JAMES PLZZZZ
He could honestly speak like that and sell a mansion to me whilst broke
That is a cool house
Omg I want a bathroom like that!!! I've never even heard of a bathroom having 2 toilets lol
When he said the formal living room, I live how his dog came walking in with a massive rainbow
james in every single room: ''we are here litterly always'' lol
Oh so that’s what you do with the hideous amounts of money devoted fans send you in return for crappy merch - it’s perfectly clear now! You might want to stop flaunting your fancy home in our faces long enough to realise your Sisters Support staff don’t even read our emails - EVER! Nor do they respond within the promised 72 hours.  It’s been one and a half MONTHS so far for me and still nothing!! WOEFUL!!!!!!! I feel cheated and well used. Thanks so much. This just makes me angry
Why is James' editing sooo awesome tho? Like bRuV
Why are there so many dislikes James Charles is a great YouTuber!!
Imagine the kid that has to tell their parents they won 100k -
me when he said 100,000: :OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is honestly one of the most stunning homes I’ve ever seen. It’s literally breathtaking & so classy😍 Congratulations on your amazing new home James, you’ve earned it💕
I love your house ,it is beautiful.

James I love how you not only brought us into your home but you kept it so simplistic and true to yourself. Even though you are rich and famous you aren't flaunting it and being flashy.
You're my idol
James you’re house is like a Barbie dream house 😍❤️

James that’s crazy that you will be giving away $100,000 dollars. That is so nice you are giving money away to someone and that is going to be very very exciting. You absolutely deserve a house and you deserve your 21 million subscribers and much more because you are so amazing at what you do. Even though I know I won’t be picked and I don’t want to be greedy about it I I am cheering on for anyone and wishing everyone good luck.     Love you James Charles🙏💕

Your house is JAW DROPPING. Congrats on this big big step! I hope one day I'll get to have a house like yours!
Okay, but if he became broke and had all his possessions removed from him what would he have? An annoying personality, a big mouth and a big ego.
but where is the piano grayson gave him for christmas
Amazing house. You deserve nothing less. ♡♡
I really need the money
I'm so happy for you James❤️❤️❤️
Obsessed xxx
The mater bedroom, is the size of my  house 😭
Going back to everything that had happened before, all the issues and backlash.. everyone was so rude to him and not believing in him was so painful to see. I knew since then he’s gonna be big and successful in his life! ❤️ He managed to ignore all the hate that he’s getting from his fans/followers and allow himself to be open minded and take everything so easy. You’ve changed so much Jamie! I’m so proud of you! You deserved everything you have right now! 💕 I don’t feel jealous at all knowing that  I am already 25 years old and still depending on others. 🥺 I know the time will come for me! I just have to fight and work on it! Videos like this doesn’t make me feel poor or different. It’s just this young boy being successful on his life is really helping me to achieve my goal in life, it’s motivating me honestly! Sometime we think of how lucky these people are to be having this blessings but in reality they’ve worked hard for it! 💕💕 I want to say congratulations james! I am really grateful to be motivated by you! 🥰😘 Keep doing what you love! 🙏🏻
I just hope I'll win part of the 100 thousand dollars you are such a vibe ur house is literally everything😍😍
This is sooo inspirational. I would like if any of you guys subscribed to me. I’ll soon would love to be like James one day. Please help me achieve my dream
Winning that £100k would literally fix all the problems I have in my life omg
When James’ pantry is more organised then your life 😂

This house is absolutely STUNNING, everyone did such a good job brining this together! It's one of my goals too to have my own home. Love you and all your hard work!
I feel like James is just like a vintage-cottagecore person plus a softie🥺
Its he or she
Here's to everyone working on themselves and trying to achieve your goals. Let this video be an example of what's achievable if you work hard & play smart ❤️
Is it just me or does @rebecca zamolo have a similar house  Like if you agree zamfam/game master network

The number of times james said personally or formal is the number of likes this video gets.<3
Nice
James literally had my dream I dreamt with my life early

"Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire." "Goodluck!" 💵💵💵
His house is so chill, I love it! It's so peaceful and calming
Imagine how much time it takes to clean up the whole house fully

Random fact:  The word ‘quarantine’ derives from the Venetian dialect of Italian and the words ‘quaranta giorni’, meaning ‘forty days’. This is because when it was discovered that ships were infested with plague-carrying rats they were made to sit at anchor outside Venice’s city walls for forty days before coming ashore.  -SciFacts
Well done James for reaching 20 million and I would just like to say u filmed this video yesterday right and u were on 20 million right and now ur on 21.2 million

Love you! I moved house! Before lockdown but mostly                                                     If ur reading this stay safe!❤️🧸❤️🧸❤️🧸❤️🧸❤️🧸❤️🧸
I really wish he had a lapel mic on
That book shelf with no books on it makes me sad 😔 but, proud of you James!
I also love this House 🏡
Imagine for a sec this is your house. Now look at your house. How Are you feeling?
☕
WAIT ISNT THIS ROSANA PANSINOS OLD HOUSE?
Oh my god he's so beautiful woah
I love James Charles he is the best 😅😻
The closest gave me Hannah Montana vibes🤣💀
You is so cute  :)
That would be great if you speak in a clam manner.
Me skipping to the end of the vidio to see the give away 😅
Are you a guy
looks like drakes tootsie slide house
Selling sunset vibez
WHY are you leaving us hanging?!?!? 😫
I’m always confused with people who have sliding doors that completely open, to create and indoor outdoor space. Do bugs not exist in California???? No moths? No flies? Nothing??  I think those doors are stunning and I wish I could have them, but it seems so impractical.
It’s so beautiful 😍
I usually love goin out rather than staying home but if this was my house i would never leave my house 😂...his house is soo damn beautiful. Love it James ❤
🧁🍧🍨🍰🍯🍾🍷🥂🥢🧃🍹🍺☕🍫🍬🥚🥞🍓🍌🥭🍟
I thought he was about to say we’re giving away the house in the intro.
u go gurl
The piano... only sister squad stans will understand this...🤧
The amount of success James has found is amazing. and a $100,000 dollar giveaway? That kind of amount could change anyone's life oh my god
Mr Kate watching this 👁️👄👁️
Why did I think this was the exact same house 😂 so glad you found a space that fits you!
U house is soo Cutee!!💮💮🌸🌸🌸🌹🌷🌌☁️☁️🥰🥰
Dude I need glasses..... I saw this in Trending and FOR SOME REASON....  I thought it said "I bought my first HOMIE" LMAO Duuuumb...  😂😂😂😂
Go back to project zorgo
What an extremely beautiful house! It really gives a very calm vibe because of the color palette used in the house is very minimal. But black and white can sometimes look a bit cold. The wooden elements that can be found throughout the house give it a warm appearance. This is literally a dream home. really pretty! Also so much respect that at the age of 21 you already managed to buy your dream home. That also gives me motivation to really follow my dreams and not because people say that dancing is an insecure profession and there is little to be earned that is should quit. After all, YouTube and social media is also insecure, but you show that if you really have a lot of passion for something, everyone can do it. Love your videos and the positive energy you radiate. Keep up the good work! X💪🏼🥰
The vibe of the house is so soothing and calming ❤️❤️
Omg sister u should come back to SA 😘😘😘😘😘💋
It’s the master bathroom and the sitting area at the stairs that sold me
Played myself at the end
I want to be rich as him😭
😘
Wow

Everything you have earned you deserve.  Your hard work has paid off. Especially looking at everything you went through. I got my first phone this year and I’m so glad I became a sister. In this crappy year joining the sisterhood has been a highlight so thank you. Love from Ghana 🇬🇭

*Oi james lemme live in your basement*
wanna c parttt 2222222222
Дом Джеймса охеренный🥵💫.
A truly beautiful home 🦋
Who is she/ he
Could you help me? My mother live in lran. I need 100.000dollars
But like why is this my dream house?😂😍🤗❤️
*OI James lemme borrow your house*
Jesus Christ saved my life, five year poly drug addicted junkie, repented and quit all drugs I was on (heroin and kratom, bud vaping nicotine, all day everyday) struggled for 5 years without Jesus. First month after I became saved I'm entirely sober. QUIT BASHING GOD HE WILL TAKE YOUR SOUL AND RESTORE IT BACK TO WHEN YOU FELT LIKE A CHILD! I've cried more in the past month than I have in 10 years, only difference is that they're tears of joy! Demons are REAL and they play spiritual warfare on your mind, stay consistent in prayer and Jesus will deliver you but you HAVE to want it!
Damnnnn 100.000 dollars wth. I could pay my entire college journey AND my stepfather's medical bills.......
can i borrow ur house for a day
Absolutely stunning! 😍😍😍 I love the homey feel and the see through glass doors to the closets and pantry. Cant wait for part 2!

Sister successful at 21!
Probably 1000% wouldn’t win so ill just say it, it would have been a blessing for people that he had instead divided that money and given it out to more people that are in terrible need of that money, than probably an upper middle class girl that’s gonna swear to him that “she has worshiped James from the moment she crawled out the womb”
Someone's going to be making this house in mine craft I already know
Your bathroom is bigger than my house.
hey james just to let u know i am a big sister fan and always will be ilysm and ur house             from                      macey xx

❤💛💜
Congratulations on 21 mil subscribers ilysm James!! ❤🎉
When your house is so big, you need to film the video in 2 parts
so proud! this house is stunning looks like a dream !!
Are there any other Brits finding it offensive that he called that big black light a chandelier? Like to me a chandelier is a fancy light holder with loads of crystals hanging from it to help mirror the few lights on it around the room, not that medieval inspired light shade (yes we call it a light shade in my house) that looks like it should hold candles in a castle in Kent or the country of Wales, not light bulbs in a home in whatever city in California that James lives in.   (I put “the country of Wales” for the Americans who don’t know that Wales is a country)
Wtf where did he get the shoes
Who loves james Charle  ↓
thank you for your house tour sister james and congratulations on the 20 million subscribers.
Your house is beautiful James !!
James house is beautiful 💖💖

DUDE-
Hi Sister James, I am using my moms email to tell you that I have been a fan for forever! My family and I  have been really stressed out lately because my mom is a single mom taking care of three WILD kids!And also because of the hurricanes that are coming in. We were hit really badly when Hurricane Harvey hit about two years ago! are house had water inside that was three feet high.  Right now my mom is using a walker because she had a complicated migraine. She has paralysis on her whole right side. Right now the four of us are living in a two bedroom apartment were I (a girl) and my two brothers share a room and my mom has her own. Life is tough and money is tight right now, so the money would be a blessing!    P.S. I am not trying to play on your sympathy. And if you decide to give the money to another sister, that's ok with me! They will be very lucky! To: Sister James From: Sister Saraya (Raya)
It's so nice to see him evolve above all the negativity. It really isn't about the mistakes he has made or how people want to portray him, It's how he grows from it and he clearly has. ❤️
Me when I heard him say 100,000,  👁O👁
This video realized me to never give upon your dreams.😍😍😍
Beautiful home.  I love how you using white as the background color to incorporate other colors into it to featuring each furniture and decor.

Thank you sister for giving us the opportunity to dream and see that dreams can come true! I wish you the best today and on the future. I’m still waiting for another new amazing pallet 🥰

Socialism appeals to the weak and incompetent because those people don’t have much skills or talents to compete with people who are better than them. So those inferior people want to pull everybody else down to their mediocre level by means of "virtue signalling" and pretences of "moral" validation. Those are the people who need big daddy government to take your money for wealth redistribution through high taxes and handouts labeled as "social" programs. It's time we put those worthless trash in their place by any means necessary.
The.....the.... the... BATHROOM!
Games with James ! Please bring back !
wowwww
Congratulations 💗

I like that James isn’t being so polished nowadays. His personality is a lot more fun to watch.
My dads friend decorated that
I GOT GOT JAMES CHARLES MERCH
I like how James forgot that he was supposed to show the backyard later on xD
Imagine having 2 living rooms
This place looks the samee as the last house 😃 so weird 😃 feel like watching a home makeover not a new house 😃 but i undrestand that it’s new.. just so weird and similar 😃

James closet is bigger than my whole house. Yeah I'm so pooooor
Pls I wanna win the giveaway pick me
His closet is bigger than my bedroom😂
This house is so beautiful. I want my future house to look like this but just not a mansion (don’t get me wrong a mansion would be nice but I’m not gonna be rich anytime soon lol) my dream is to retire from my boring job and become an artist working from home and just doing whatever I want really...that sounds nice.
I wonder how many underage boys you could hide in that place? 🤔
Holy. Sh!t.
His whole house is perfectly organized and decorated. Plus, finally someone use beige and black metal in his house! I love natural colors! I'm very, very happy to see him accomplish a great achievement like this, I hope he always has a lot of luck and health. ♡
The fact that he bought this home at 21 YEARS OLD blows my mind
soooo james how do i win?
:o
I'm just saying our sister could be a real estate agent 🤭🤭  Hope  everyone is staying safe! 😷
Sister
I’m literally in love with ur house. Like I will sleep outside just let me live there 😗✌️

That emoji was my EXACT reaction after he reveled the prize for his give away. I can’t lie, watching the video gave me so much motivation.
Idk how to enter the guveaway but I’ll do anything
James I recommend that you mount up the mirror in your bedroom.
I saw the house I was like yesss sister. *sees video* -sips tea cutely 🍵-

Dear James Charles I'm a really big fan but there is a rumor going around about you and I was wondering if it's true ready okay are you Marshmelone
James: The stairs so the basement later on I will show you.. Me: are there kids in there we get to meet?
Let's see how many of you are scrolling down the comments like me  👇
how does the camera man not shake his handss🤸‍♂️
This entire video screamed "you're poor" in every language.
His whole house is bigger than my cousins, my school, my bathroom and house combined..
James’s room bathroom and closet is my whole house :)
🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮
That is an amazing house 🏡 🥰🥰🥰
OMG! Looks great! Congrats James!!

I LOVE JAMES CHARLES NEW HOUSE!! THIS WAS PROBABLY LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS-!
is it sad that his bathroom is bigger then my room-
20 million special?? Sister ur already at 21 million
I would love to live in his house , such relaxing vibes
POV: you’re wondering why there’s so many comments from an egg
10/10 gold stars all around
your house is goals. like I aspire to one day have a house that nice.
Ok but like when u said 100 thousand dollars it came to my mind one thing I wanted to do for my family and if I win that giveaway I can make it come true i need to see the rules now
James:here is the living room  Me:(also not caring jk) FINN
sister curiosity why do those two guys live with james ?
Flexing on us during quarantine  Why?

Jame's me saludas
So creative using coca cola
I would be lost in there
And all I see is eggs

James plays piano just like how he talks: fast.
I’m sorry but I absolutely love him. He’s a literal queen
So your telling me this is his first house SO HE WAS POOR?

Lovely house!
😯😯😯
Wow that’s amazing james
I love James charles😍😍❤
Ur house is literally so gorgeous and now I can't wait for part 2 lol
Let’s Goo Queen!!! Hit me up in the dm, let’s pop some cherry for that new house.,
i can't help but imagine someone taking james saying he owns a coke cellar horrifically out of context xD
James playing games  "SHORE" Like if u agree
James playing the piano with those nails hurts my soul.
Why tf am i seeing so many “?k subs for an egg” ppl in this video
I am not digging the wooden/yellow colors . Not my style at all but nice house !
James if u ever thought about doing livestreams again play Minecraft with Dream
When i told u i SCREAMED when i saw the house LIKE GIRL I CANT EVEN AFFORD A APARTMENT 💀
Wow 🤩
James bedroom is the size of my house
wow😍
Love your house!! Can’t wait for next video
Lol coke cellar.
the house is absolutely gorgeous james i’m so happy for you congrats!
Congrats on the new house James, the design is so nice
How much was it? ($20mln?)
Congratulations, James! Your new home is gorgeous and this video is just what I needed to take my mind off the fact that a category 4 hurricane is barreling toward us!
I love the house
James I wanna see gaming videos please
Pretty house
can i have is im poor but the only thing i have is a leronit
Is house is very similar looking to Rebecca Zamolo house like if you agree
i find it a bit frivolous how he has a huge kitchen but postmates everything, a dining room he never uses,
How do you Charles I’m a big fan I watch you since day one I love your brand new house congratulations you motivate me to do more and more make up I love you so much congrats again
*3 days after watching selling sunset*
When his bathroom is bigger than your  house 👁💧👄💧👁
I have 10 shirts and 1 pair of shoes-   We can definitely see he’s rich just by the closet 😂
this is literally my dream home.
100,000 dollars oh damn that's life changing
Loved the kitchen is so big and has a nice view nice house u picked for ur first home 🥰💖
This is my dream house
Omgg James ur house is eveything! It’s such a beautiful home so proud! Also congrats on 20 mil been here for so long and rlly happy that u come this far. Love u sooo much. :)
I’m so happy for you❤️💕 you have worked so hard through everything life has thrown at you. 💕
Who else's life would change for ever for  one hundred thousand dollars? Oh my gosh. I honestly couldnt tell you how impactful that would truly be for me and my family!!!!
Gorgeous! Money well spent. I'm glad you chose a mature, sophisticated interior design to grow into. 👍👍
I absolutely LOVE,LOVE,LOVE,your home! It's beautifully decorated! I'm very happy for you,sister! 💜🙏
Hihihi
I love the vibe of his house!!
i yust to live in the house
❣️inspired af may just start a YouTube
why do i feel like jame's houses layout is very similar to missremiashtens house?!!
James for ur next vid u should try to do ur makeup with kid makeup like makeup for justice or Claires
Me taking notes for my next minecraft house

JESUS DIED & ROSE AGAIN TO FREE U FROM SIN ACCEPT HIS GIFT✝️✝️✝️
Loved this video!
This called me poor in 100 different languages 😳😌💅😔
Whoever picked out the slabs for the fireplaces did a really good job. To find a marble with veins that look that good is difficult.
Not gonna lie but his house kinda looks like the layout of Rebecca Zamolo‘s house
it's like a mix of fixer upper and property brothers and I love it.
james is THE best
James seems so genuine and down-to-earth. Honestly, if I be friends with any celeb I would love to be friends with him!
GIVE  ME  THIS  HOUSE      NOW
Personally not a fan of the way it’s decorated just looks plain and quite boring so much more could’ve been done.
I like how james is so energetic and so positive about everything🥺❤️
I'm wondering because the custom piano that Grayson gave to James said sister on it if James put the piano in the basement aka sister studios aka where all things sisters would be located.
What if it rains?
James charles look fab today
This is beautiful
James Charles house is bigger than my my school and grades combined.
I would like to see u cook pancakes plz
That’s a lot of money James.Hopefully someone less fortunate is lucky enough to win it.
Your house is as amazing as you❤
Such a nice home ! You have good taste ! Congratsulations 🤗❤️
Why is everyone’s pfp either an egg or YouTube
To be continued...🤦🏻‍♂️
Someone : how many fools are there in world Me : 22M one who subscribed J.C
Love it James!!!
MeganPlays the YouTuber made you a roblox accounts can you please make a video on it

So beautiful! You deserve every blessings that come your way Sister! Thank you for the house tour, wow! I can only dream of a house like that. 😍😍😍😍😍 The house is so lively and bright, and happy! Lol! Unlike some mansions all gloomy, lonely, and dark like the person who lives in it. Lol. I am so happy for you! 😍
he says 20 million special but is already at 21.2 haha love you congrats!!
Blah. There’s no personality. Even the assistants (or whatever they are) have bland rooms. White white white everywhere. Put up some accent walls or SOMETHING!
Guys look. This is how far CONFIDENCE can get you.
I love you james!!!
Congrats hun house is beautiful
my bf woke up from his deep sleep when James said “coke cellar” 🙃
James Charles: I bought my first house!  Me: Who?             🤔            🥱             WHO TF ASKED?!

Is this the same builder or something that built Jenna Marbles house?? Maybe it's just me but they look similar.

COLLAB WITH FELIX AGAIN PLEASE
Saint Padre Pio of Italy who died in 1968 had the wounds of our Lord Savior Jesus Christ for fifty years. the top scientists watched him 24/7 and could not disprove him and even his own could not and many many atheist became practicing Catholics and their families. They turned away from their old life because it is written if you do not want to believe because of the words believe because of the works. Amen.
Coca cola wine cellar i just can't that is the best creation ever

Video Content Suggestion: THE MAKING OF EVERY JAMES CHARLES' YOUTUBE VIDEO (An Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes)  It is going to feature the long process of producing phenomenal and viral James Charles' Youtube videos. From the brainstorming stage, the planning, preparation, set-up, long hours of filming, the retakes (which are so fun), bloopers, the editing stage, finalization, the people behind the cameras, and more.  Significance: 1. GENERAL AUDIENCE  It is to show everyone that being a Youtuber and a social media influencer is not easy money and it is not always glitz and glamour. Instead, being a Youtuber is a REAL JOB. And just like any job, the video will show everyone the struggles, the effort, and the stress of being one.  This awareness about a Youtuber life aims to make people understand what the job really is and so that more people can APPRECIATE this career.  Meaning to say, AWARENESS and APPRECIATION.  2. ASPIRING AND SMALL YOUTUBERS The video will show aspiring or small Youtubers out there that this career can be challenging at times but at the end of the day, it is a lot of FUN and it is REWARDING. This will INSPIRE small Youtubers to continue filming Youtube videos and keep pursuing this passion of being an influencer.  Meaning to say, INSPIRATION.  3. SISTERS  The video will provide SISTERS around the globe a closer look of our dear JAMES CHARLES life as a Youtuber and eventually bring the SISTERHOOD closer to each other.  This video is going to be a BLAST because many people are interested what really happens behind the scenes of trending Youtube videos.  Hopefully SISTER JAMES and his amazing team will notice this suggestion 🙏  What are you're thoughts about this kind of content? Reply your insights on this comment 😉😄
Noooooooo it fineshed damit
You’ve grown into such an amazing person. Proud of your accomplishments 🥰
How do I have chance to win??? I am already Subscribed.

What a beautiful home. The black and white decor is breath taking. Very different from the "pink person on here". I'll not name names. I like both because I'm a pink girl. What would happen it it got struck by a messy hurricane? Lots of hard work went into buying and fixing up this home. Congratulations.

Hope will have similar one in the future
Omg! And I’m glad that you’re being who you are!
You should’ve done a before and after picture of your home. And congrats on 21 million!!

He gives me so much happiness I wish I could meet him or be his friends he is so sweet to give all that .only away I want it not in a mean or rude way I am not that type of person someone who needs help should get it
wowwow THAT HOUSE OMG OMG i just got a house too but it has 15 aceres and im so excited to move :>
James, your house is beautiful! I know this isn’t the full giveaway video explaining how to enter or anything, but I am so entering. If I won I would give the money to my mom to let her finally buy a house. We’ve been living with family relatives because she hasn’t had enough money saved up to buy a home. This would mean the world to me if I won and I would honestly cry pure happy tears for the rest of my life. Even if I don’t win, this shows how much of a great person you are. James, this is why you’re my one and only favorite influencer of all time. Thank you for everything- your content has always brought me so much joy. I’ll be sure to watch Friday’s video right when it comes out considering my post notifications are on. Can’t wait😊❤️ (insta- _ryleighluznar_)

Congratulations on your beautiful home babe! It truly is a blessing to be able to own a place you can call home and feel secure in it. 😘😘😘

So nice to see James so happy, he fully deserves it. He has grown so much the past year and it’s so refreshing to see him surrounded by good people and being so content. ❤️
So beautiful🧡
The coke cellar 👁👄👁
Can i get the 100k my brother really wants to go to college
I dont give a shit.
So Beautiful I’m Jealous AF. I too had that dream of a house (not as incredible as this ) just a simple home. Unfortunately at the height of my career I became disabled so the house ... never happened I’m on apartment #14 now. This one doesn’t quite have what yours has . This one has holes in the floor , mold growing throughout and hasn’t been updated since 1960’s . Sadly I have pets and try to find an apartment when you have fur kids is IMPOSSIBLE. Good Luck in your new home. May the walls be filled with happiness and laughter 💜
this some selling sunset ting
Devoted fans, look what you guys have paid for!!!
What’s the giveaway
JAMES: Be careful with the coke cellar. If an earthquake hits and they all fall...RIP Sister.

I personally don't like house tours but this was interesting

If I was him I’d show everything because I’ve worked so hard for where I am and he should do it
Looooove the outfit

conspirisy: this isnt even james house, its just a flex and a sponsored video for all the decorators included - why would he put his house on the internet.... *thinky face*

Aloha, I am a realtor located in Hawaii. If you ever want to buy a little piece in paradise please look me up! :]
Oh my, James! I thought your last house was my absolute dreamhome, but now that you’ve shown us this.. Well I’m speechless, it perfection! 😍
He's very successful for a 21 year old
The cliffhanger tho
to the beautiful person reading this : have an amazing day and don’t let anyone bring you down 💕
James I have no words 😭 It’s beautiful 😍😍😍😍
isn't  that Rebecas Z house ?
One day when I become James Charles, I will own a house like that
Love it!! Gorgeous!!
Jamessssss congrats 🙌❤️❤️❤️❤️you're house is awesome 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I'm obsessed with everything about this house
He sounds sooooooooo professional
You bought hype house??
his patio is bigger than my backyard
MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!
James: Cliffhanger! See you Friday! Me: **sister s h o o k**
I clicked on the video so fast he couldn't say hi sisters
You are the person who made me in love with makeup I LOVE YOU  P.S. I can give you some recipes from Pinterest
Play Fall guys
This has called me poor in SOOOOOO many ways
Okay Sister!!! You really did that shit! I need to see the full reveal see you Friday 😉
Commenting just so that don’t read my name will comment on my comment :)
I think he’s grown up so much and really centered himself and got out of the drama headspace. He’s always talked about buying a beautiful house as his goal, congratulations on getting there✨🧚‍♀️
Congrats James! Deserved ♡
I wish i lived there. Congrats sister. Such a cool house.
this reminds me of  an open house architectural digest video
I am subscribed and the reason I think I should win the giveaway because me and my family of 6 are trying to save up to by a really nice big house I would not call us rich but we are also not poor but are needing a better and newer house and we could use all that money for the house
Why is james bathroom as big as my room😂😂
It’s very wholesome hearing that his #1 Dream was owning his own home. Not to be famous, not to have all the money in the world, just... have his own home 🥺❤️
His pantry is way bigger than my kitchen 😂
Ooooh my god, house of my dreams! 🥺🤩
His channel is so elevated lately. Idk how to describe it, but a 13 year old could love it and so could a 30 year old. Classy, professional, but fun. Love it 🥰
That’s my name
Love you James
Uhm well
You are wrard
You go Girl!  Enjoy TF out of that house!  YOU made this happen!  Congrats to you!  007
why are the top comments all from an egg
hello i love you omg
To the person called don’t read my name     STFU
I’m building this in Minecraft..... No cap
Never felt so broke🥺
I really love this house and how it was decorated ❤️ I also love how excited he was during the video and how he explained everything in the house. I'm proud of James for getting a house! I hope you keep accomplishing more goals!😁 You deserve it❤️😁
I’m barely 2 minutes in and I love it!!!!😍
15:27 coolest house thing I’ve ever seen. I want this lol
MEANWHILE, I'm VERY proud of all of your accomplishments, James. At such a young age, all I was concerned about was finding someone to marry and have a family with.
اكو عرب هاذة متحول لا بنية ولا ولد ليوفقني رءي لايك
when can I move in?😯
I’m really to take the 100k 🦋🤣
No  quakes
I love this. It looks so clean and calm - the black furniture is so sleek so it's not as overwhelming and I just think you really see the positive energy flowing through this house 😌👀❤️
The only thing that bothers me is the shoes in the house lol but other than that love it!!!!
I must be doomed to suffer for life. Every time I start to get ahead of bills & try to save money, something happens - heart attack, my kids needing 10 teeth pulled because they have extra teeth for some freakish reason, constant job layoffs, the basement flooding because the hot water heater rusted through the bottom, etc. etc. Does anyone else have this bad luck? I'd love a nice house. Not necessarily a million dollar house, but something not 250 years old in an area where the taxes aren't astronomical. It sucks not growing up in a family with money. :(
James isn't my favorite but I love to see people thriving like this no hate all love here <3
Omg imagine if larray and James done a a video where they play RHS!(ON ROBLOX!)
Wow🤩🤩, you’ve came so far. You deserve this. I’m so happy for you ‼️‼️
I thought he had bought a house last year (?
Replace that coke wall with ur awards ,best pictures or favorite things later on . ❤️😊
$100,000?!?!? WHERE DO I SIGN UP?!?
this called me poor in ALL languages lol
Holy crap his shirt❤️❤️❤️
Okay so 1, how can I buy this house off of you, and 2, is your neighbor's house for sale? because honestly living around or in this house would be a dream come true lmao
Who loves the new Sister house but still kind of misses the old Sister house...   ME!!
love a good coke cellar moment
James’ home looks like it has a filter on it and I’m living for it ✨
what song was that that he played
James just needed better friends lol
Love the house so pretty but the shoes on the white carpets is kiiiillinnggg me 😖
Your house is giving me all the vibes I want if I ever get to buy my own home😍
NOT COOL!! I NEED THE OTHER VID NOW😭😭😭 literally soooo beautiful. happy 4 u James!
Can we take some time to appreciate how beautiful this house is
🏠🏠🏠🏠

MORE GAMES WITH JAMES!!!!!!!!!!
YASSS BRING BACK GAMES WITH JAMES PLZZZZZZZZZ
Amazing tour, can’t wait for Friday!! Congratulations on everything you really deserve it❤️🇨🇦❤️
youtubers: quarantine isn’t that bad. just stay home! youtubers houses:
It's not your home, it's fin's home
omggggg so excited for the giveaway and the video on Fridayyyyy! Also this video inspired me to get my life together because when i'm older i can be as successful as Sister James!!!!
Babe NOOOOOOO!!!! from a security standpoint anyone in media/public eye should NEVER post/ show/ or advertise the layout of their home . EVER!! It gives an intruder everything they need to know about what access points to use and the more you can keep to your advantage, the better . Security and alarms , you can always get around that. He must not be working with a reputable security company, because they would highly highly advice against that . Which is another clue in to his life. No 24 hr security
honestly in the past i hated james just because i saw him as “basic” or “mainstream” and never gave his channel a chance but now i’ve been watching more and more of his videos and realized he’s just a positive creator and overall unproblematic (unless when he’s forced into it, which is honestly upsetting) but he’s honestly great way to go James just being you and staying positive 👏👏
Isn’t he vegan if he is then I don’t think vegans eat marshmallows no hate
Simply goals
James Charles new house is definitely a vibe to whosever coming into house👌🙌
James is literally the best prison ever 😂 like he is so easy to binge watch! Lol
Omg Congrats on the new house!
He's "so beyond excited" In every video and I appreciate it

James has really matured loving this new content
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18  Have a fruitful day.

This is the James I like to watch . Loved how he wasn’t being braggy but super humble and grateful !! So happy for you James !
JAMES POST PART TWO NOWWW dont leave me on a cliffhanger like this😪
Can someone tell me where he got his pants?
My name is Taylor and i'm a double major in art education and painting. the odds of you seeing this is slim to none but i just wanted to tell you how similar we are and how much you have impacted my life. Like you started with drawing, I have always loved painting and the arts since i was little. I was always interested in makeup but your videos grew my confidence to buy eyeshadows and explore painting with a new medium! I just wanted to thank you for giving me that confidence and showing me that art is art no matter what materials you work with. Now I feel i can say i am good at eyeshadow and makeup in general and so many of my friends come to me for makeovers at school. My next goal, as you got your house, is to save up money and buy a studio for myself. I want to have a painting area and makeup area as both are so important to me now. You following through with your life long goal gives me hope that i will someday reach mine in buying my own studio and in the LONG run having a showcase for all my art. Again, thank you for always being true to your talents and goals! my art insta is Taylor_cohen_art if you wanted to check out things I have done!
I litterally thought the thumbnail was clickbait
Wow How i wish have same have you both. Keep safe Madam
James house passes the vide check :3 // x
Congrats babe♥️
James deserves this and I am so happy for him! He seems very proud and I am loving that for him! Sister fresh❤️🥥
What a beautiful home 💞 congratulations James 🥰💙
I have how detailed this house tour was. James really gave us a clear explanation and tour of everything without it seeming too chaotic or dizzy. Keep up the great work and congrats on 20 (now 21.2) million subscribers!
james called me poor in 146 different languages
Vert beautiful, very clean!
Well, if it speaks like a girl, and dress like a girl, definitely is not a man..!
No words to explain how amazing it all looks! Literal goals, everything is so perfect! All your hard work defiantly has paid off. You're such an inspiration 🙌🏻🙌🏻
I can’t deny the fact that I had my doubts about James & didn’t have a liking to him at one point, but you HAVE to respect everything he has done and built for himself. Amazing. Ecstatic. Wonderful. Never done better. LOVE.
His whole house is such a vibe  ✨Asthetic✨
when james charles closet is 2x bigger than your room
WTF IS THIS... IT CAN LIVE IN A HOUSE LIKE THAT AND I CAN'T... IT is À HE Or she?!!
I LOVE videos like this! I’m an Interior Design student (and will be getting my masters in Interior Architecture) and can say that the team you hired actually knows what they are doing! There’s a lot of firms out there that just decorate to decorate, and there is a MAJOR difference between decorating and designing, and they designed this place. I can see James throughout the entire space. It matches who he is and there’s still room to grow and advance in his life, which is shown through the minimalistic feel of the house which definitely matches who James is as of now (being only 21years old and already owning a massive house). With major room to grow and advance when the time comes. All I can say is, good for you James! Keep it up 😊❤️
OMG I LOVE IT
James: 20 million subscriber special!! Social blade: Am I a joke to you?
It's truly a dream house
A whole vibe
WOHA
ok so your rich rich
What!? Is that thing a man...!? No way! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
OMG JAMES IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU

Si hamba mužského pohlavia
Gosh James. I would love to teach you how to cook. It’s really so easy. All you have to do is have good recipes to follow. Eating good and nutritious food is so important for your body, mind, and emotional well-being. Why not hire a cook?  Or someone that can teach you how. Nutrition helps with hair, skin, nails......everything your body needs to get thru the day. I highly recommend it for a growing young man
he lives in ikea idc
Stop it before it breeds

Congratulations James on your First New Home Renovation!! Now that it is completed,  and you have had a moment to live in the home.... what would you say is your absolute favorite spot in the house/property... and what would you say is the absolute most important thing for you when thinking back and say "Yeah... I finally accomplished purchasing my first home... and this was the ONE thing that I kept telling myself I absolutely needed in the home/property to keep me grounded.. I had to have it, there was no other option"  You and Your interior design team did a fantastic job decorating & designing the home.  Did you take any before pictures so we could see what the home looked like prior to the "James Charles" makeover?  Can't wait for Friday's post! I'm dying to see your outside patios, pool, lawn area and gardens.

Me: omg his living room is as big as my downstairs   James: It is the perfect size I love it so much    Me: MY DOWNSTAIRS OF MY HOUSE IS TINY
awe this is honestly so inspiring! here's to every one of james' subscribers to garner enough success to be able to afford something like this one day <3
Curious to know how much this house costs. Where i live it looks like it be about a 2mill house. But in cali this gotta be 5mill atleast
To the person that I see this may god bless you no be safe during these times ❤️ please help me reach my goal

Congratulations James !! You earned it for real
james ily so much! You are beutiful. Your personality is beautiful. Your house is beautiful. You are perfect. I love how youre so unique
Hard work pays off , congratulations
When you ain’t 18 and you know there ain’t any chance of u getting that 100k😢
21 year old youtuber can have this house. While a person who works hard everyday for 10 hours a day can barely make rent for an apartment. Our system is fucked.
His house is beautiful. The back yard looked amazing as well. I couldnt be more happy for him. All his hard work has finally paid off. He has a place to really call home and it soooo him. Congrats on the house James and to 20 million subs.
you seem so happy, u deserve the best love u James <3

When James pantry is bigger than your bedroom 😶
Your master bathroom is bigger than my bedroom.😢😔
This is how many times he said coincidentally(ho hate love you sister)  👇👇
That house is so beautiful talk about my dream home
So young and so successful! Wow you’re an inspiration James
I love how he has SO much money an could’ve spent it all of these overly expensive things just cause he could. He didn’t flaunt his house he simply gave us what we asked for and that was to see it. He stayed true to what HE WANTED an kept it very simple yet modern and I just wanted to say, I’m very comfortable with the energy we have created in this space today 😌❤️
This is one nice house!
Amazing house james
amazing home!!!
Who’s we? Who does he live with?
omg that money would help out my family so much but the house is stunning
I love the aesthetic of your home! It's amazing! I love it, we are so proud of you congrats on buying a home!!

he really did that to us at the end-
Its beautiful💗
I loved your house 🏡 🏠

james house is literally like theroyaltyfamilyhouse i think royaltyfam and james live in  same neighbourhood
So happy for him! 🤗 The house is stunning! I love the fireplace!
Very happy to see you doing so well, although big luxurious houses aren't for me; I can see this is definitely a goal you've worked very had in and you made it your own, keep up the good work my fellow artist.
He said "we are giving away 100,000 dollars, end the video now the suspension will kill em"
All I gotta say is that whenever I look at a house I puke today I puked 2 times🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

so happy for you James! you earned it and you are so humble in your presentation of your home. it is not ostentatious or vulgar. so low key and chill but still very classy. I don't know you, but I am proud of you for achieving your goal of homeownership esp at such a young age. Keep up the good work!
Omg that is the house of my dreams :O but I live in a third world country lol

Giveaway Time Stamp: 16:38
Home, this is a fucking Mansion .
Who’s eating for Friday
The house is cute.. but to be honest, it seems way overly staged, to the point where it doesn't even look like anything gets used, or even touched. I know he had an interior design team & obvi he wanted it to look good for filming this video, so I get all that, but it seriously doesn't look like anything there ever gets moved, touched, or used. It just kinda looks boring, like a model home, nothing looks warm or inviting about the home. Just my opinion.
I like that the house isn't empty and plain, nic-nacs make it seem more home-y. I also like that it's not just his gaint home all the himself, he shares it with his team, and I feel like it makes more sense to have such a large house when you have people living with you.
It looks AMAZING! I loved seeing all the changes from the first house tour! Congratulations!
please add captions for deaf/hoh sisters!!!!!
I absolutely love his home 🥺 I really don’t see why James got hated on. He seems so laid back, chill, and sweet. 💕✨
I love you so much you’re my everything and I wish I will win this giveaway 💞🥺
Congratulations James you deserve this and much more! You’re such an inspiration with all that you do and we love you! 💛💛💛
I love that even though the focus is mainly on James cause it’s his company, he still has amazing spaces and rooms for his team members.
Yay. I hope I win.
The layout of James' house is very similar to Remi Ashten's house
Wonderful house the colour is amazing 😍❤❤❤
with my luck i won’t win lmao but i loooove this house
Congrats on new home! X love you James X

I love how he’s not bragging, he’s just really passionate about his home 🤍✨💫
It's SOOOO pretty I want to cry🤩😆😭
Your home is so beautiful 😍
His house actually is better and more "homey" than Jeffrey's mansion.
Imagine being rich i could never
*gum pops*  My houses wig is snatched
Rich people are fascinating because they hire interior designers and there’s a bunch of stuff in their home all chosen by strangers, and the homes are all virtually identical. I wonder if they all have a secret room where their actual belongings go or if they don’t keep anything personal if it doesn’t fit the polished aesthetic.
His closet is stunning
Omg hai sisters
I it just me or he says every room is formal   👇
wow, such a beautiful home!! looks so homey and welcoming 💕
Almost 24 hours and James has 21M
Lol  week girl
Such a beautiful home!!! I’m so jelly!!! I can’t wait to buy my first house for my daughter and I ! I’m working on it!! You should do a fall and Christmas tour 😍😍😍😍 your house gives me such aesthetics vibessss😩😩💗💗 congratulations by the way hun!!! That’s so awesome!!!

Beautiful, congratulations
Happy moving day james.

James room is literally bigger than my house

You have a lot of clothes and in the video your house looks soft I love I wish I have such a house
wow so nice
I love the house 🥺
🏡🏡🏡
God has saved your life
games with james please come back :(
Can we just take a second to admire the aesthetic and how good the lighting is? The house looks beautiful and so neat! I can tell he's super excited to share this tour with us. This just comes to show, hard work pays off!
I love how practical he is too like most rich youtubers have houses with rooms they don't use or that don't make sense for them but it really seems like he made sure every room has a specific use that worked for him and that insured he used every room. I LOVE that
Instead of coke cellar, why not "Soda Cellar" or "sister soda cellar"
Beautiful House....Loved it!
I honestly would love more games with James, I’m not the biggest fan of make up but James Charles has such a wonderful personality to watch, please bring it back
is it jus me or does the house look almost the exact the same..
PLEASE TO MEGANS MAKEUPPPPPP
That house is worth 20x more because James lived in it
His house do be looking like an Ikea commercial tho
I’m low key jealous, I wonder how much this house cost, his house looks staged tbh
Mi sento povera dopo questo video🙃😭
James literally has the dream modern house we all wanted
I love it💕💕
James just casually has a tree and fridge in his room😂we love that

Jesus is coming soon!  Change your mind about sin, and accept Christ as your Savior. He gave up His position of glory in heaven and came down here to suffer, then He died on the cross to wash away all our sins. Three days later He rose from the dead to prove that He was the Messiah, and that He really did pay for our sins. Believe in Jesus’ redemptive work on the cross, and you will be saved! John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”

James your taste is legit pristine i love it so much.  Everything is so pretty seeing your house made me happy fr.
GOSH!! I LOVE your house so much!  Like it's so comfy and cozy. Love it  -sisters
this home is SUPER beautiful but its SO stark white it feels almost sterile? I would luv to see a few more pops of color and a few more eclectic pieces just to bring in some life & usability. To each their own & I understand that the sleek, all white on white on white look is pretty popular w/ the kids right now. Lol. Good job and well done on being able to purchase a home while being so young! That is a WONDERFUL accomplishment. U should  be VERY proud. ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
*gets ad in the middle of watching the video*  Me: 😱😠😠😠🤬😭😭😭🥺🥺:((( *ad finishings *  Me : 😎You thought bitc-😘
Our life will change if u chose me
It's perfect! It looks so homey.

I don’t usually watch his videos, and why YouTube recommended me?? No hate but for some reason his mouth is too big which is weird to me, that’s the reason why I don’t watch his videos. No offence 🙏

this entire house is so beautiful, like something out of a magazine, but designed by james
jame's personality is so likeable
I’m confused if James doesn’t drink what that green apple crown at 5:47

Your house is beautiful!  Can't wait to see the "too be continued". Kinda wondering how you get entered into the contest to win $, or do you just have to be subscriber?
I don't know this young man but I am proud of his achievements.
James selling real estate on Selling Sunset season 4?
ГРИНЯ Is a bot dont listen to him he only has one video xD

This house reminds me so much of Colleen's and of Jenna Marbles'
I like how its exactly 17:00
Day three of trying to convince James to do a Hamilton related look lol
Omg! I would love to enter!
Thought it was going to be a 20K giveaway but 100K 😳 LAWD!

Hi James I really need that money my mom can’t pay rent right now and if she doesn’t pay in a few days will be homeless so please can i win the giveaway
Beautiful House and very very neat😍you are such an inspiration ✨
It’s so beautiful
instead of 100k can the prize be a room in your house🥴
When your dog matches your house 😗
I want this house so BAD BUT IM BROKE
Your home is really lovely; so tastefully decorated. Congratulations!!!!!!
I LOVE YOUR HOUSE!!!!
I’m so happy that James is getting everything he has worked so hard for!, I remember when I saw he’s first Video and to think he has gotten so far is truly amazing, you go James!
*I,didn't get it that why people hate James ,,,he's so loving and entertaining*
But did anyone see the coke pointing the wrong way, I can’t unsee it
To anyone that's feeling motivated or inspired by this video, do be, but know that unless James continues to earn hundreds of thousands from his YouTube Channel, he won't be able to afford to keep the home.  The tax he'd pay on this property every month would be HUGE.
Loved your house.it’s really dream come true for you😍
JAMES WHY YOU DO US LIKE THAT
Sisters James!!! Where did you buy those jeans? They are hella cute!!!🥺🤩🤩🤩
U did not just stop the vid👉👈
This is my dream house
If I had a house like this I would literally never leave. You inspired to keep working hard so I can have a big beautiful house one day
Your house is Beautiful James
omg he needs to do games with james! i would love to see him personally do gaming and perhaps streaming!
HE GOT A DOG
Well the ground plan of the house kinda like the home of Rebecca Zamolo but I guess that’s just how houses are built there
His closet was bigger than my room.
100k OMG😳😳😳
James' outfit though❤️🔥😍🤩
What’s the name of the music at 2:20 ?? Lol someone please answerrrr
i’d literally sell my soul for that house
did he say 100,000 dollars... *SHOOK*
So beautiful house
I feel poor😂VERYY poor😂❤️
Oh yeah now its obvious. Too much work...... Oh well you can always work toward being an MJ impersonator. Just Dont have overnight juvenile visitors. Place is an overdone dump just like you

🏡
my one year old sister came to watch this and said "wow" to the house lol,i didnt even know she knew what that ment
Do part 2 pls!! 😊😊✨

James how can I Enter the giveaway?
Hi Charles my name is Aleia and I am 9 years old and I am English. Do you swear?
I looooove your house
Love this home omg❤ goals
You should get a Ps5 when it comes out
I love how James has two rooms with closet's and I have about on section of his closet to share no hate love u James 😂💗💗
The house is so beautiful
It's a really beautiful house and the interior is sooo aesthetic 😍😍 One question tho: who and how to clean this big house? 😂 If it was my lazy ass no matter how much i decorate it after a week it would be dusty 🤣🤣
omg
Do not get me wrong, the house is beautiful, but I am simply wondering why rich people buy themselves a house even though they are living alone? Is it already an investment for the future, or what is the idea behind it?:( I do not understand. (And does it not get scary to be all alone in one big house lol)
james charles house is literally my dream house
Absolutely stunning 😍❤️

the house is perfect James! Congratulations on your new house!
how much did it cost to renovate it?
So happy and proud of you James! Live it up here, this home is so amazing!
I'm still a kid so you may not take my opinion but I honestly think this guy has truly deserved and earned everything he has. Not only is he positive but he also presents his arguments without indirectly or directly dissing anybody. The world has tested this guy but hes pulled through so fucking much its unreal.
I think you mean 21million
Weird
wtf this is legit like matt and rebeccas house
I loved when you mentioned the guest bedroom referencing your parents. “Nice and far away.” 😂😂
Тут есть русские?
you did not just say to be continued.
Omg my heart shook because if I got blessed with  a little money I could start my own YouTube up
Wow that is cray cray
I’m so happy for James! He is so awesome and I love his videos. It’s amazing that he’s only 21 one he’s already this successful! Congrats!!!
😊🤩
Not only am I proud I’m also very jealous xD
*why*        *are*      *you*          *g* *a* *e*
ur pantry is like the size of my room  Also his closet is the size of Barbies closet
I have a video/channel idea for you. You should have a live stream of you cooking a meal. It would be interesting, you could answer questions or other things! Please get this to the top so James can see! :)
James: it is finally time  to take you guys to the next level of the house                           Me: -chokes on water- NEXT LEVEL???? I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WHOLE HOUSE
i really wanna win this giveaway so i hope i will be lucky person !😘😍💖💞💕
-How many areas do you want? -Yes literally so proud of you!
Did anyone else notice he didn't have the sisters piano in his room anymore? :(

This inspires me so much, I really hope one day I can buy my family something HALF as nice as this.   Right now I'm in an overcrowded 2 bedroom apartment with a fiance and 4 kids. Lol    This is just so inspiring and I am so so happy for you! So happy. I wish this for everyone honestly. What I'd give to have this life for even a short amount if time. I try to imagine but I cant truly I cant. I start to cry when I try lol    So proud !
omg congratulations! the house looks AMAZING!
That piano is from Yamaha.... a motorcycle brand..

James heart this for no reason
James Charlés *french kiss*

I love how the house is stunning but still has a “homey”, welcoming vibe. Congratulations on the new home!
i wanted to see the sister headquarters :/
Lol this comment section is so dry everyone’s comparing what they have with what James has.
That house is so aesthetic and kinda vintage
What about mr Kate
It’s sister stunning!
WE NEED GAMES WITH JAMES
I m a. big fan of you I'm nine
Oh james take a breath while u speak
his  house is like Rebecca Zomolo's
notice how the whole ex sister squad either got an apartment or a new house ?😂
Coke Celler....  OKAY THAT DOESENT MAKE U SOUND LIKE A WANTED DRUG DEALER AT ALL!  lmao
Uugh!! Stunning!! I am in love with the earthy, modern decor. It gorgeous!!!! Hard work pays off and you can now sleep in your accomplishments.
lmao my mom doesnt make that much in a year 😅
James: you have to watch all the way to the end for the giveaway. Me: skip the whole video and only watching the ending of the video.
So was he just living with his parents this entire time
everyone: my house is the size of his room     me: my house is the size of his smallest kitchen cabinet
Ily
i may not be a fan but congrats on 20 mil u have come so far and that is a nice house
Your house is so aesthetic ✨
I’m confused how do you enter the giveaway?
Your house looks so nice
21 mil
I'm so proud of James
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG
Love your house and the way u do your makeup your energy is the best
Congrats Sister! You deserve it. You are inspiring keep it up!
every room is so pretty-
Who can guess how much James spent on this house😂
this is the best youtuber house i’ve EVER seen. it’s so tasteful and simple and modern. nothing is tacky or out of place. your designers did an excellent job. i’m so happy for your success and this beautiful home🤍
god do i hate the minimalism trend
I really loved the interiors of the house.
🏡🏡🏡🏡💫
We love the growth ☺️
Did he say 100 thousand dollars? 😶 how can I get that, single mommy with a baby and a passion for makeup needs that 💰🙏🏼 help a sister out
The inside of his house looks like outside and that's very refreshing
Okay, so this is obviously super cute and looks great! Is there anyone out there that just doesn't like this kind of esthetic? I feel like this is how every single person decorates their home and I'm just personally not a fan, I think everyone should do what makes them happy, but is there anyone that has a different liking?
mmmk but this is like the ad for design home or whatever.... I'm literally so jealous
This is my idea of dream house. Absolutely beautiful
I live in india so those dollars ain't gonna do anything but your house is😲😍😍
I'm so happy you are amazing and you deserve that house and thank for making my life better😊❤️
james’s house is aesthetically pleasing to the eye
This looks like one of those boujee af bloxburg houses  in the good way😊

ICONIC 😍
This house is the definition of glam
COKE CELLAR YEEEES!!
"Piccolina, don't give me that look." Leo's accent became thicker, more rugged as he spoke. He pressed Carmin against the door, quickly reaching down to lock the knob.  "Why are you here?"  "You know why I'm here."   "I don't." Carmin squirmed a bit under his hold. The feel of him was growing more natural, more normal.  "You've been avoiding me." Leo moved his hand from the lock, to her chin, ensuring she had her eyes on him.  Carmin squinched her eyebrows showing that cute confused expression Leo loved so much. "Can...Can we just forget about the kiss, It's driving me crazy."  Her forwardness was something Leo would never get tired of.  "Piccolina, I like you."  "What?"  "I like you  and you have to deal with it. No more hiding out. No more running away."  "I-"  "I kissed you for a reason and I'm not gonna pretend it didn't happen." Leo's eyes grew a bit darker. "You're not gonna pretend it didn't happen."  Experience what happens when two clinically insane individuals fall in love.  Follow my wattpad account @malayjahthewriter

Who needs Architectural Digest when you got James Charles
Best house on youtube!!! Dannnngggggg!
Okay but like yassss king. You are thriving and you have built such an amazing life for yourself
When your outfit matches with your house 😻

I’m so so so proud of you James❤️ You truly inspire me!! Stay blessed and CONGRATS on your new home💕📎
The house is beautiful...But the dog is even more beautiful🐾❤️🐾Congrats on both😊
It’s absolutely stunning 🦋
God is the pen James is the highlighter  God drew the world  And James made it more brighter ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💝🌅
🏠🏠🏚🏚🏘🏡
It’s my birthday 😅👍🏽
It's beautiful and calm but I don't understand James you have MONEY! And you have obviously paid good MONEY for this! It shows. But what kills me of there isn't one piece of classics design, something stunning! Also something that's gonna keep it's money or even make you some. All of these pieces will be in sale next year as they are just trend. Which isn't a bad thing and you have they money to just change it. If you want any advise on some beaut stuff that's also good investments hit me up x

wow james house is a dreaaaam
James room is bigger than our house.

When you live in a two bedroom one bathroom on story home 👁👄👁
Omg wow
Beautiful house ❤️ love the interior design
Honestly I ADORE This.. something about light wood is mWUAH, chefs kiss. But like also.. Imagine being Jeramiah Starfish and spending billions on the "richest" things and ending up with a dumpster fire looking house, but a 21 year old with moderate style takes the cake in pure aesthetics and class. King shit honestly
I still remember that kid with the thiccc eyebrows, he's so grown now * Feels like an old lady *

*He really went ham 😂*
Okay, can we all take a moment to just applaud James, Ive only been watching him for a year now,  but I just love how successful he is for his age (literally Im the same age as him), and I love how humble he is compared to other youtubers... he seriously could have gotten a home way more showy, but he didn't.  I just feel like that speaks volumes about his character. I absolutely adore his house. I wish him all the best.
I love his pants 😭 I need jeans like that
Lol the scene where Fin just pops his head in The corner 😂😂😍😍
His house is what I want from life!!

James in literally every room: this is where we are ALL THE TIME!
He played the piano as fast as he talks
Beautiful. you never mentioned what do you like from the house that YOU enjoy? Why you choose this space?  You mention family and friends but never yourself.
James’s room is bigger than my house

Yes it’s big but it’s another generic looking house
James: opening the door to his master bedroom   Me: 👁👄👁 Me: Walking into my small dirty room  👁👄👁
I feel like I’d be scared to touch anything there. It looks like a model ikea house or something lol
this man should start repenting for his sins
A cliff hanger...on a HOUSE TOUR. JAMES you’re KILLING us
This gives me tumblr vibes
21.2 Million now
You are a man, not a girl, stop calling yourself a sister you are a MAN. Creepy.
ngl i replayed the intro like 20 times where his dog was walking bc it was soooo fuckin cute. ugh i want a dog
I feel like he was one of the "celebrity clients" on selling sunset

So so very happy for you James!! 🥰
James Has A good House and He is good at playing The Piano
My question is what happens to those couches in the balcony when it rains
Everyone: My room is small and dirty...and my house is the size of his room Me: Doesn't have a room
I’m a “I feel poor,again” button UR welcome 🙂
Why did he do this to us ;( I don’t wanna wait :(
Is it just me or does his house look like Rebecca Zamolo
Me in a poor family looking at this house 😲😫
feeling ✨poor✨
So pleased for you!
And also I swear half of the kitchen is copied from klhoe kardashians house
When James bathroom is the size of your apartment 😶😅
I love how his house obviously is really expensive and everything but at the same time very “homely”. I see houses where there is just huge space and that’s all but his house has a “personality” if that makes sense😂
AHH I LOVE UR HOUSE
i like how u don’t brag about if u have designer furniture bc us poor people don’t know about the high end stuff but u just actually make a good entertainer
I couldnt do white couches I'd reckon LOL I'm only 7 minutes and 56 seconds into the video and I already have the comment LOL
omg
I just bought my first home too, so this is inspiring me so much how to design it! :)
Ob der Reaktionsboss hier auch vorbeikommt?

Wow james, this is just everything! Congrats! ❤
He would only sacrifice his ending spiel for something as incredible as that announcement at the end like BAM
I have a serious question. I love the huge sliding door but do you not have mosquitoes in California? 🤔 Because I live in Wisconsin and all I can think about is all the annoying mosquitoes that are going to be in the house. 🤣
JAMES HOW DARE YOU NOT REVEAL US THE REST 😡😡
Wow 🤩 is all I can say and congratulations 🥳
I love the living room
James can I get a sister shoutout
I'm feeling poor after this.
Damnn James, he's such a fun loving person. Ilovehim 😭💕
All I kept saying during this whole video was, I wish I had this house. Absolutely stunning house! I love it all!
Amazing
Watching this video, makes me wanna study hard, work hard and be able to have a house like this. 🥺🥺
the fact that he posted his 20 million sub special and the next day he hit 21 mil
This house is prettier than I am
This house is stunning James all the hard work paid off ❤️🙏

Wine cellar filled with cola, huge kitchen and walk in pantry but doesn’t cook, bookshelf with no book... alternative title : you get triggered you lose 😂

So I saw him do jo
After a hurricane there’s a rainbow. They really tried you the last few years, but you made it through, and prove them wrong. 🙏🙏🙏🙏

Omg I love it and u
Decor is amazing! People always say not to bring work home but you must honestly love it since youre bringing ALL the work home! Congrats James !  100k would buy a house where im from 😳😳
I think James is brilliant but I feel like whoever did his house for him missed the mark. It seems super impersonal/modern like someone just copied it out of an architectural digest spread
James Charles make your hair long
Miss James you look like Kris Jenner
I'm literally in love with that 🏡😍😍 Congrats on 20 million subscribers! I'm so happy that you get your dreams come true.❤❤❤love u so so much!!!

I've literally been fan of him since before his first apartment and seeing this makes me so happy and proud
This is kinda random but you should go on the show hot ones, it’s were you eat really spicy Chicken wings. I really want to see how you would react

Before he said that we didn’t know what the giveaway was I thought he was talking about the house  Me before I realized: SiiiiIIIIiiiissssssSSsssss
Yes
i just KNOW it smells so good in there
so was he a girl before or a guy then wants to transition? I'm so confused. Got decent content tho!!!
James : *shows his kitchen* "i dont cook" Me: "now i wanna see u cook even more"
Your house is really gorgeous.
No offence James but what is a merur
But didn't you buy that other house like a year ago? So would this not be your second home?
hi james ily sfm. u deserve the world and everyone is soo proud of what you have achieved
So this is my “formal” house 🙄
This is how many people like James Charles new home 👇
i’m not being funny i couldn’t be more proud of this boy. Such a young age and such an inspiration ❤️❤️❤️❤️ILY JAMES
WAIT HOW DO WE ENTER FOR THE GIVEAWAY AND WHY DIDNT JAMES SHOW US MORE OF SISTER STUDIO
james as a lil kid:heheheheheeh ima cook    grown up james:this kitchen is so good but i never use it i always postmate  *smiles*
This house reminds me of remislife’s house
How I want my bb house to be:
We love the minimalism, it’s so hard to keep things simple but he managed to make it all work👏🏼
😮
Love the house James, it’s beautiful 😩😍😍😍
This is a prime example of balancing light/ dark colors that makes the eye move around the space so nicely !!! I’m so happy people are adding more black into their living spaces like ceilings, accent walls, tiles which actually creates a very cozy feeling!! 😍
James: 100,000 dollars is nothing  me: WELL IF I WIN ILL BE ABLE TO PAY RENT :,D
Creator of the house: How many areas do u want   James: yes
james you freak me !! srsly tht much moneyy
♥️♥️
or gays charles
I love, Love, Love that outdoor space. That day bed is everything.
I definitely like the more mature style of clothing.
I love your astetic
I’m so happy that James has a nice house that he loves. He works so hard for everything he has because he works so hard for it! I love James so much and he is my inspiration 💕💕💕
wow 😅
The house is amazing 😍 😍 😍
change the name to james gaylares
When’s the next part
okay, can i live with you?
I seriously don't understand the point of giveaways. If you hit 20 mil, meaning 20 million people deserve it. Instead of giving televisions and laptops to certain, reduce the price of your merch that'll benefit the whole 20 million.
Lo puedes hacer en español
this is too celebrate 20 million subscribers. me looking at his subscribers count: umm you a 21 million

Congratulations sister 🎉 SO happy for you :) your hard working is paying off! Your house is SO beautiful 😍 I love how nice and humble you are 🙏

Hello
how much is rent
And I know there’s 20000 more people out there but I really really really need this money... my floor was ripped up because we were going to put down wood but we don’t have the money, I’m 15 and my Burthdays Monday and we can’t afford me a car, I might be a kid who wants money but... I can promise you, I would go to a good cause, me a car, my parents bills, charity, and my church. So please James... if you see this, even though you probably won’t, please please please think of me and consider helping me
I subscribed and turn on post notifications and I absolutely love your videos🥰
Omg I love you James and your house 🤗
I smell a music video
Can you tell how much all this cost?
Oh!!!!!!! Sister, do you need a house-keeper? I am really good doing the cleaning work girl! Beautiful, cheers!
This house is GORGEOUS & well deserved!!!! Nothing like having your own humble personality showing through it all!!! Giving me some inspiration on my “some day” kitchen remodel!! It is the ♥️ of the home & I LOVE to cook!!! 😂😂😂 Thank you for inviting us in your home!
i want to see more this video

Omg! I just missed the live lol
You forgot the basement:( I was hoping to see some kids in there but next vid:)
Woah... if I had 100,000 dollars I could get a car... I’m 15 and I don’t have a car, it’s my birthday on Monday and I was supposed to get a car but I can’t cause we don’t have money. I understand you probably think I’m lying for the money but I’m not, my family really needs this to help pay for the house and my 3 siblings cars... I know your not going to see this but I really need the money.
Sister house ayyy 🥰🥰🥰🥰
This house is very similar to Jenna marbles house. I wonder if it’s in the same neighborhood or maybe the same designer
I can’t afford to watch this
im not checking the comments but i really want to be one of the first one XD
Sister is a whole property salesman

Can't wait for the next part...
I swear James can fit sooo many sisters in his house omg
Congratulations James, I’m glad you pursued your dreams❤️ Can’t wait you see part 2🙂
I subscribe to everyone but I have no permission why 😏😏✌
His house is bigger than his career
It’s so stunning and very well deserved. Congratulations, Sister!
Is there a reason James house is layed out exactly the same as jenna and juliens? Does it mean they live on the same street or something? 😅
I love the home I would love to win the giveaway
Wonder how he's gonna keep all that white, sparkly clean. Perhaps a maid and laundry service? Looks staged for the video, and doesn't have that home cozy feel.
I absolutely love how tastefully decorated your house is James!! It has a very classy, peaceful vibe!
My favorite part is Finn Charles chilling on the bed and pushing away the ball with his tongue and bamn... The ball's down, shit, should I pick it up or wait, I'll let James get done with his tour first.
¡WOW QUÉ COOL!
I love this for you James! So much natural light, a beautiful home ! You should be proud 😍
What a work of art that home is! 😘 James is out here living the dream and working hard ❤️
His house is so nice can't wait for the second part

What happend to your brother Ian tellll usss
Literally all rich peoples' houses are so boring cuz it's all for show and not really a home.
Is this the third house he got?
I'm really broke. Can someone give me money
Damn 100k
Your master bathroom is bigger than my room
WOW
Is brother Ian living with you?
flexing with james’s house cheeek
I want to hate on the 'coke cellar' so bad. But it just looks so friggin cool that I want one!
i have never wanted to keep watching a house tour so much
He has TV set which he generally never used😭
🏡🏡🙏
OMG the bedroom is dream... Just love every single thing in his house
so happy for u!
Can I be as flat chested as you,   Like can we trade?
Is this just the show home version? 🤣🤣😂🤣😂 this is amazing! You deserve this 💓
The only thing I absolutely dislike about this house is: there's literally nothing personal in it. It looks beautiful but also way to cold I think.
James Charles house is bigger than mines. I think its da biggest house in da world
I love you so much 🥰🥰🥰😍 so happy for you
my stepmoms friend did the decorating to your house
Love it
can you consider having another way to the patio or hangout terrace instead of entering first in your master’s bedroom. for privacyyy reason its much better to have it divided
beautiful home james!! congratulations 🤩
wow your bathroom is the size of my house lmao yassss Queen
The pantry is a dream 😍
Gorgeous house sister!!💜
This looks like a IKEA ad
it's times like these i think to myself that maybe i should work hard... nahhh
You house is soooo beautiful like you
Ur house is so beautiful I luv ✨
He is such a inspiration here I m sitting and living on my dad's money he already have a million dollars home. So proud ❤️❤️
How many millions is this worth!?
Why does his house look like the zoom Virtual background 👁️👄👁️
I don't like it i lobe it it's so cool and awesome I wish I was there love you

Omg so Beutfall😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

FINALLYYYYY
You got........  LIKE ONE MILLION MORE LIKE IN ONE HOUR WOW. <3
Woahhhhh
YOURE JOKING!?!? That would literally change our lives 😦
What happens to the outside sofas when it rains?  Btw I absolutely love the house it’s so beautiful and it’s literally my dream home but I just can’t stop thinking about the outdoor furniture in the rain lol😂
Your house is so big my God
bro his bedroom is bigger than my entire apartment 😭😭😭
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE, IT GOES WITH YOUR PERSONALITY JAMES🤍
In the beginning, when James said “and this is the 20 mil give away” my dumbass thought he meant the house at first😭😭😭
So I've not seen any other comments mentioning this... but this house was surely designed by the same architects/contractors as the ones for Jenna and Julien's house? Or is it just that all modern mansion-style houses in LA are the same layout? LOL (I studied architecture + interior design in the UK so have no idea)
The house looks amazing and also i subscribed and turned on post notifcation a long time ago... But i guess i was kinda shy to comment... 😐😵
i don’t know if i could live in such a “clean” house because i mean if you just let your trash in the living room for one second the visual appearance is ruined
You should do a makeup look inspired by the decor in ur new home! or a Coca Cola look!
Omg that coke cellar tho 👌👌 looovveeeee the kitchen and the decor of the house is stunning ....oh and the pantry tho 😍😍 ...lets not forget about the pool and the back garden ..it is just goals ...hope to be able to earn enough to have something like this in the future 🤞 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
ugh I love leclair ❤
I love you you guys and you have a really nice houseI wish you luck and I wish I could have a day with you sisters I love you guys 😘😘🤗🤗🤭
You worked so much, you deserve all of it. Congratulations it's beautiful
The way the coke bottled are stacked in the wine cellar is kinda giving me anxiety
Who are Louis and Travis? Anybody?
Congrats James!!! We love you 💕🎉👑
Loved that he placed coke in wine place🤣🤣
Im to broke to watch this video
That's big
I smell a Sisters Sleepover 👀😂
I've seen a lot of house tour in youtube but for me, this is i love the most, i love every details of the house, sanaol hahahaha

Also my drivings lessons start and my laptop broke en when i buy my new laptop and pay for my lessons my money is GONE lik gone i'm freaking out because i can't find a job here with a photographer.

I love this house and love your outfit James! 🏆💞🎉
okay wait what did i hear that right??
Hi sis
“ Half of these people recognized her from the back”  Me knowing 2020 TikTok with 16-year-old girls: she do be twerkin
The fact that after whole 17 minutes he still has more to show😭💅🏼💖
I'm so glad he FINALLY has a big mansion of his own now. He was like the only beauty guru that didn't and yet he made so much money. lol  also your home seems soo cool! but kinda simplistic? I'm more for that shiny expensive Jaclyn Hill vibes but to each his own. Its VERY pretty too!
So happy to see that you accomplished your goal of buying a house! Beautifully done and fits your vibe perfectly
James:”Who knows what future activity...”    Most Ppl : “ Wow James tmi just tmi “  My reaction : “ Pffft “
i need brother and sister season 3

Love you
Everything, beautiful 🏡🏡

James:WE ARE GIVING AWAY 100K   ME:.... I AM EVEN SCARED TO GET IT  Love you so much ja!es💖💖💖💖
James can we all come and live with... cause it looks like we all can fit in ur big house 🏠....... and by the way lm so in love with ur 🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋 outfit.....😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
And James deserves every bit of this. He works the hardest!
Why aspire to be a doctor, scientist, researcher, police, teacher. When the money seems to be in making crazy videos and saying things to catch peoples attention.
For such a big kitchen that’s actually a small pantry and scullery / butlers room. But the house is stunnnninnnggggg.
Fans keep asking me to do this but I don't like making people feel bad. Idk what to do, ugh. Would have been cool if James was his own decorator, I feel like he could have done better.  The house is beautiful of course, but they cut corners with that white paint, it's overkill and a bit lazy on the designers part. That's all it needs, more color here and there and it's perfection.
It literally looks like a show home. Beautiful congrats James!!! 😄
Idk can I have a house alreadyyyyyy. Y'all who reading this ,you gon be blessed with a beautiful home by the end of this year.
How do we enter the giveaway tho?

When james said "20 milion special.." i thought he said 20 BILION🤣
Dios cuide mucho de ty eres espectacular 🥰🙏🙏🙏🙏👏
his office is as big as my kitchen and half the size of my bedroom lOl
If I hadJames’ money I’d want Jo from Fixer Upper to design a house for me....very homey, rustic, cozy, and warm like a hobbit cottage w/ a massive fireplace.🤗
I mean this is almost as big as my room
Yoooooooooo
all of my clothes fit in one of those cupboards in his walk in wardrobe.
হিজলা নাকি
Everyone trying to find out how to win the giveaway me lying there : i ain't gonna win
dont put me on edge like this sister
that fireplace doeee! AHHH SO MUCH LOVE!!!
I would love to take a lot of pictures from each corner of the house 👁️👃👁️
This is the ultimate flex
6:54 you're welcome in advance :))
this is my first time watching James Charles and I really don't understand why he's got so many haters, like he doesn't act or say anything offensive.
I am sister shook-I am speech lessons—
He is so organised and hard-working I love people who are like this btw he also has nice taste in furniture
What happens to out door furniture when it rains??
That one coke bottle turned the wrong way! Eeeeepppp!!!
HOW MUCH MONEY DOES JAMES CHARLES MAKE İS İN THE NEW VİDEO.
is this homes under the hammer fam
luv the aesthetic
you have such a beautiful, cozy home! i’m obsessed with this aesthetic and organization!!!
The interior design in this house is absolutely unreal. In complete love with everything
Add CC plz :(
idk why but i thought  u would be giving the house away  :/
Does anyone else have a bedroom smaller than James's bathroom?
Omg!!! So beautiful
THE GUEST ROOM JOKE I CANT 😂😂😂😂😂
Slow down when speaking ffs
Anyone in his right mind would ask himself this question : How can a man of 21 years old in this time of history can buy a house that luxurious and make 10 millions a year ... Talking about superficial stuff , he represent all that is wrong with internet and yet he is constantly on top of trending . COME ON NOW !!! Don't sell your soul guys it's not worth it .
Anyone else want to be a professional organizer for a living??!!!!
My parents are lucky we didn't live in that house otherwise I may have never cover out of the closet.
If I buy my own house and it doesn’t look like this I DONT WANT IT
The person who will win the giveaway would be the luckiest person 🥺 im sure it would change their life
Mom: you better be doing school work   Me: *watches James Charles instead* 👁👄👁
Is any other Latino that is freaking out because the coke says “medio litro” or it’s only me
I really like your house.💜💜💜🏡🏡🏡
done james i have sub since you were at 100k
That house is way bigger then mine and it is just the neatest house in the world
Hold up... James can’t read music?!?!?! But he sings and plays the piano... he won’t get very far without being able to read music
*his home budget is my whole life value*
Mr.kate watching it 👁👄👁

Me: that master bathroom is probably the same size as my whole house!
It is rare that I can see luxury home tours and not get aggravated (as someone in my 30s who feels like I've worked just as hard as plenty of young social media stars did who somehow end up in mansions at 18) but for you I am honestly so so happy and I'm so excited watching this. You deserve this SO much. The world tried to bury you James and it failed. You deserve every single inch of this beautiful home. I hope you make lots of beautiful, happy, warm memories here.

James couldn't keeping up with sister subscribers number and saying 20 mil while there are 21 mill already is goalzzz 🌺🌺🌺
James 20 mln  21 mln
With your money and you're wasting your time sisters 😂😂 Only here for this msg😎
His master bathroom is 3x the size of my room
I smell heresy. Let the cleansing begin.
okay but i am OBSESSED with the vibe of his house
Wait Can we please take a second for that FIT?!!
In the beginning, when James said “and this is the 20 mil give away” my dumbass thought he meant the house at first😭😭😭
Wow his bedroom is as big as my entire house
Love 💕 the sisters your house James is very nice and welcoming and I especially love warm and cool colours
YOU DESERVED IT JAMES!!😘

OMG,  already love the house tour. It's sooooooooooooooooooo cool. Sisters master keep prooving that there's nothing impossible every day. After all of his work and difficulties that he gorgeously walked through, he keeps achieving his dreams and we can see the results of believing in yourself. Feel sooooooo inspired rn. Do really want to be like SISTER MASTER. 🥰🥰🥰Love you James 💖
DONE
To all the people commenting “he’s sooo down to earth” and that his house is not a mansion: IDK what kind of house y’all grew up in, but this is a mansion. Period. The end.   Just because his house doesn’t have 20,000 square feet and look like Jeffery Stars’, doesn’t mean it’s not a mansion 🙄
*Only people who love James Charles and his positivity would like this comment right now*  But the haters: *periodt, love*
So aesthetic I can’t even
So proud for you.
The giveaway had me 👁👄👁
for a second i thought james was saying his house was the giveaway lol

A wine cellar without wine...I'm crying inside.
Congrats sister on the new house it looks amazing
The only thing that kept me going during my workout 💕
Coca cola? I thought james is more of a pepsi person
James: *speaks fast  Also James: *plays the piano also fast

Excited for part 2
Me: *“I am def. recreating this house”*  Money: *“In your dreams, little girl”*
And when I'm bored I always watch your videos
Y’all the YouTube ads were xtra annoying this time 😂 I was trying to enjoy my sister tour and every ad that popped up literally came right when he was revealing a new room 👁👄👁 but can we talk about the coke cellar! I’ve never seen something as iconic as that 👑
СКОЛЬКО ЛЕТ БУДЕТ ЖИТЬ ТВОЯ МАМА ?  ИГНОРЬ: 8 ЛЕТ  ЛАЙКНУЛ: 57лет  ПОДПИСКА: 1999 ЛЕТ
Y'all his shower is bigger than my bathroom
Ngl, my favourite moments were when Finn decided he wanted to be in the vid and starting appearing in random places 😂😌
I subscribe and turn on notifications and like your video I love you and your house
I don’t have Instagram so if I need to follow you for the giveaway then I can’t get the giveaway

I LOVE HOUSE TOURS. This is so aesthetically pleasing
James I subscribed and like and turned on my notifications. I think I should win  because my mom has been looking into buying a house but she hasn’t been getting paid as much so that would really help and our house really needs some work done to it if I don’t win I understand.

Hi sister I wrote a poem for you! Ok, here it is..     You are talented, you are beautiful, your amazing, and your super cool! I love you more than anything, and your the best YouTuber I have ever seen! ❤️❤️❤️ You inspire me I love you!
His bathroom is bigger than my room
Omg James its beautiful!!
I can’t wait to see what this beautiful house will look like during Christmas with all of the decorations
So, you posting this with a smile on your face means you have room for your followers who's homes (during these times) are under forclosure and/or homeless?🙃😂🤔
Yess please do games with james!!
But he totally deserves it. He worked hard for it and got al lot of hate, while still chasing his dream. Ly James ❤️

When he said IT is the 20 million subscriber giveaway I was like is he "giving away his house"😮 just for a sec

Imagine being this rich to do a room only for coca cola

Wow so beautiful I wish I could by a house like that we are moving soon so I am excited but sad because I lived in the house that I am in right now that I will be leaving I have been here for 12 house
I could literally sleep in Finns bed and I would be ok
Wow the give away winner can literally start a new life with that money. I know my chances are REALLY slim but i seriously need the money to immigrate from my home country. I live in a country that is supposed to be a republic but because of the ‘president’ it has turned into a dictatorship. Our women are being murdered and raped everyday. I as a woman am not safe here. I NEED to move to a place that excepts me and my family. I really hope i win but regardless good luck everyone and thank you James and his team for this amazing video and giveaway.
am I the only one looking for the piano that Grayson gave James
His house really said roblox adopt me house

okay but james styles>>>>>>>>>>>
AMAZINGGGGG HOME ,THANK YOU GOD FOR MAKING YOUR DREAM COME TRUE🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wow your house is so pretty!
How many cokes are in this house?🌚
this is the most beautiful interior design style i’ve ever seen! so refreshing and light and at the same time it’s so glamorous 🤩
SO HAPPY FOR YOU🥺
The Coke seller is one of the most unnecessary use of space I've ever seen you should honestly take those wine cellar things down and use that little room for something else a nice glass wall room like that would be a neat little space for something
You have big support from Serbia!
I love the house
The house is honestly GORGEOUS AS HELL! It matches your aesthetic so well.
This video called me poor for 17:00 min
We have been waiting for this.
'I promise I'm not having coke before bed. The addiction is bad, but not that bad',  James ... Do you hear yourself talking? 😂❤

*20 million sub video* posts when he’s at 21mil 👁👄👁
Me crying because I know I won’t win but we are going to loose my house i have lived in for 10 years because my mum can’t pay it on her own 😢
This is not a giveaway, this is lottery 😭😭😭
The fact that James is giving away $100k is incredible. The person who receives that type of gift should be gracious! 💟  Everyone says the beauty industry is terrible, but it’s not the industry. The influencers who portray bad behavior make it a sad environment. James is giving away money in a time of need and despair, while others are bickering about “he said, she said” drama.   What a beautiful opportunity James has, with 20 million subscribers to be able to provide like this. He seems so genuine and real, I’m so happy for him and his new home! 🏡 He deserves all the happiness and success 🙌🏻
Umm your first home😑😑it means you are gonna buy more houses
I really can't imagine owning a really huge house and having 20 million subscribers😢❤️ I wish I could  have a precious  house as yours love it❤️✨ STAY HUMBLE AND DOWN TO EARTH PERSON❤️❤️
this is what i want my bloxburg house to look like
Crazy 😭😭
I make some alright vlogs you should check it out
Well done sister for the subscribers !! Keep up the good work :) 😀

Everything is so white and such a creamy color, I expected his house to be like Kylie Jenners (since their around the same age) all colorful and creative like his palette. But it’s looks very mature and and cozy.
Hi James!! I am your youngest fan! I love all your videos and you soo much❤️❤️ My dream is to meet and film a video with you.

it’s extravagant but homey. i like it. nice one james
I used to like this guy but now he just looks strange to me and I'm cring crying ATM lol yes to that point . On the real I understand he makes millions but for me I don't idolize someone for making YouTube videos I do respect there point of view but to me a person to idolize is a mentor or military hero unfortunately I'm not sure how you make millions from looking and acting a certain way I dunno anyone can do what he's doing make up blah blah blah like anyone literally anyone not bashing you Mr Charles I do like that you have been successful in your life but I work my fkng ass off every day and seem to get no where I go to my ordinary job in my ordinary life but you know what I sleep like a baby every night and I feel great about my self and hard work . anyway keep on keepin on mr Charles

Didn’t mr kate to some of this?
Do all LA homes look the same? I mean I feel like I have seen a few house tours and they all are build the same with the same room organisation. The only difference is the interior design.

His casual closet price is my dream in 10 million years
WOW this house is beautyful i love it!

Is it just me or everybody else that feels so connected with James' Happiness showing his home??❤❤
Pity you're trying to look like a girl, though, still vain and screwed up, nevertheless.

*Cameraman* : _A Guy_ *James* : _Hey Sisters_ Cameraman (doesn't watches his vids): *BRUH*    - _-

Coke product placement is not coincidence
Sister success. 🙏🏽❤️
When James and his team make this video exactly 17 minutes long🤩
It takes guts to have a white sofa. Respect.
Sister shook at that ending homies!
i was searching for the 1st piano which he got from dolan twins....
Poor mr Kate they worked so hard and made it so beautiful and now you live somewhere else ☹️
Woah
Woow this house is too lovely
i love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No giveaway trust me
Celebrate hitting 20M harder the 2nd time
omg finn walking into the furniture shot made my dayyyy!!!
This house is so tasteful ♥ beautiful.
Ur coke room should be a shoe room!
where’s cassies room?
Don’t make this top comment I’m scared of heights
*aestheti-c-c-c-c-c*
To be honest I hate him
I don‘t unterstand people who are wearing shoes in their own house
Ahem.......IM WAITING FOR PART 2! I’m not sure if I’ll be patient bu I am WAITING! Also, how do you enter the giveaway
Holy crap. 100k??? That’s literally so wild.
Love the house
Amazing house  Check out my new travel walking channel please 🙏
This house is very aesthetically pleasing I want to live in it
I initially thought smart to put the wine cellar in since it seems it will affect resale value. But then with all the earthquakes just putting the bottles on flat surfaces seems super risky and it’s also clear glass so not protected from sunlight and if you have a basement why isn’t it in the basement? Why is it in such pride of place but also in a sunny, not climate controlled area?  And is there a key on the door? Given how expensive serious wine collections can be, security is key.... Overall a bit perplexing. The other things that he has but doesn’t use make more sense like the office and the kitchen since those are standard.
I'm so happy for James !!!
The layout is like rebbeca zamolos new house
i would really love to see a video about 'James playing Roblox'
omg that was gorgous
The brown touch is sooooooooooo amazing. It makes the house feels so warm. I love everything about this house. Bless you, James & the team!
SORRY FOR LATE WATCHING. LITERALLY YOUR HOUSE IS REALLY SO BEAUTIFUL✨. I LOVE YOUR HOUSE SO MUCH. AND SORRY AGAIN.
I never knew that Sssniperwolf has more subs than james
James hitting the whoa at 0:56
Hell yeah! I would love to see James playing video games 👍😊
I like his design. However, the under chin contouring is terrible. Also not needed you have tv quality camera so it making it stand out.
James a couple of videos earlier: I don't drink  Me when I see he has a wine cooler be bigger than my whole house: 😟  James now: who doesn't need a wine cooler tehehe 😃
I'm sure when a thief comes to his house that thief will never find the way out because of how big james house
this inspired me                 to get a job
I can’t wait for next video
Me : looks at his closest 👁👄👁.       Bigger than my room 👁💧👄💧👁
i love the fact that all three of the bedrooms could fit in the master
I love
6 bed rooms? and i’m sure like 4 bathrooms.... shore. 😣
the guest bedroom looks 100 times better than my bedroom in my house..
When James Charles was playing the piano the music kinda sounded like that song from "White Chicks".😂😂😂😂😅😂😂😂😂😂😏
You inspire me because of your makeup talent
James’s bedroom is the same size of my house I- 👁👄👁
I love you so much
The first thing my eye became so intrigue was the barn door.
I want to be the winner of the of the cash because I want to help my mom and my family
He rlly hit us with the to be continued 🥴
WTF I’m seeing is this even normal
his bathroom is bigger than my house
His house looks like it came out from those houses on instagram
OMG his washroom is bigger than my entire room
ho
I love how after the house tour he hits 21.1 MIL subs
OMG! A Dream House. Can’t Wait to see the rest of it! 😍
damn
I was expecting a whole makeup room there but there wasn’t any 😳
Hi James I love your videos soo much but I have a suggestion that Ian your brother can be in more of your videos and you can do like Ian and you swap lives or something luv you.
My dream home grater than this home
what a dream ☁️✨
No hate but he clearly showed that so much of his space is unnecessary. Kinda hurts when there are people literally dying just to find a single room to live in.
Tumblr whoo?
wow!! This house is so~ beautiful 😍🙌 I'm so happy for you sister
I like how James didnt get a huge mansion with all white rooms and stuff, but instead just a nice big size home😌
this was so aesthetic
This is my dream house
So proud of you!!! ❤️
Can i move in with u ?
You could of made the thumbnail better
James, I'm soooooo crazed with this, it's so crazy, and I cant wait till we can find out the rest of the house and how to win, but just know, I'm moving to become your neighbor
this house is just awesome congrats !!
I have just one question . what's your gender ?? Male or female 😩 👈 Please tell me
Best house tour ever!!
CORRECTION!! ITS 21.1 MILLION!! NOT 20 MILLION
I love  this home very open cosy looking  And you show us how big it is  It needs to videos Very cool I think one day they should do a  Hide and seek videos Or something of the sort
bro you kitchen is bigger them my BEDROOM.
Omgg, your style is sooo prettyyy
James: go to ur room  Kid:  30 mins later slams door
This house is incredible.
your house is soooo clean wow
I wonder how much is his home
9:40 is my favourite part ngl
Just only dreaming to have this type of house . And OMG !!! This house is so organized 😻🥺  Wish I will also be successful and make my dream come true coz I am literally shitty broke 😂 I can even earn also 🤦🥺
Can you adopt me?
Take notes this is my new bloxburg layout.
👏👏👏👏
i am so proud of you james! i just hope some day me and my family will get to this point in our lives ❤️
Congratulations lovely home just remembered keep humble!
Hi
When his bathroom is legit bigger than my room.
i wanna live in his house its so prettyyy
OMG 100 thousand dollars if I had the money u had I wouldn’t share😂😂
wow loved the house  i really could use the money on my dreams like buying my own house and my life long dream to buy a motorbike  anyways doubt i would win it  Love u james
Great from Chloe from Wirral xx
Games with James yesssss, I wanna see you play, love your house, I hope to be that big one day! Tysm for sharing your dream home, it came out stunning!🥰🥰😘
21m subscribers couple hours later omg
The filming and editing on video this is immaculate
Every modern bloxburg home in a nutshell:
Wheres sister Ian????
love your new home sister lol sisterhood
The Coke seller is too cute
Such a proud moment for all the sisters out there 🥺❤️
That's a massive house 🏡 Best wishes James please try to give me the price cz I'm in need of money 💰😭
honestly this house just feels like it looks pretty and that's it xD why have rooms that you don't use? fill the formal dining room with video games and screens or foosball tables or something fun and personal that you'll actually enjoy? you don't need to put things in a house just because "everyone has a wine cellar" xD take down all the bottle stands and fill it with limited edition make up or something idk xD it just seems super impersonal and impractical xD but im glad you could buy a house and enjoy i guess
It’s like the perfect Pinterest house🥺🥺🥺
Watching James accomplish so much really makes me feel like a proud mama!  Loving u since day 1 :')
Wow this is so beautiful😍😍
I love how he’s trying so hard not to flex

I am literally in the process of moving with my boyfriend from a one bed to a two bedroom apartment and both together are smaller than James‘s private area (master bed, bath and patio).
If I lived in this house for one day, I would be a skinny legend
It looks almost identical to Jenna marbles house
this house is literally my dream- can't wait to see your new videos made in this gorgeous house James!!
James should play a large game of hide and seek in his house
This house is damn huge man. And full of bright colors. Mostly color white.
James' closet is lowkey the size of my bedroom lmao
I wish 2019 James could've watched this video and see that in just a few months he would be thriving.

OMG SO PRETTTTTY I LOVE THAT HOUSEE
When the ace family released a home tour, the number of ads in the video was astronomical! I felt like i paid for a week worth of water bill.

James is so brave to have a white couch!😂😗
Somebody has had a little to many coke's

James a tip it DO NOT use makeup wipes. They are bad for your skin. Instead use some wet plush maybe from an old Pajama top
But the normal house no? What good is it for man to gain the world if he then loses his soul?
James ur home is luxurious. I love it pls invite me
We need a family reunion with the bro’s (minecraft with pewdiepie)

james's bathroom literally bigger than my entire living room
my entire house is the size of james's outdoor patio!!
Why did I think this was a fanfiction 🙂😂😂😂😂
bruh my bank account is so jealous
That house is literally a dream like wow.
your house is so aesthetic 🤧
🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡
JAMES WHYD YOU DO THAT 😭😭😭
Does he say hi sisters or hey sisters
Am I the only one looking out for the Piano Grayson gave him? Because I needed to see if he kept it

Yaasss games with James pleaseeee 😂😩💕
i love james
Make sure that you have a very very good security system
His bathroom is my entire house
Queeen!!!
I literally can not wait!!!
YouTube is getting comfortable with these ads I got 3 ads in a row.
OMG it is literally my dream my number one goal in life to get a car before my sister😂And I know I seem crazy but I am 12 years old working my butt off to get money so I can get A car before my sister somehow I found a part-time job but you’re not allowed one in till you’re 16 I’ve been working for about a year now and I only have $2000 a car that I’m trying to get is $20,000 that would literally change my life😭😨
It's looks like he is living in a magazine!
How do i win? I mean the money sister? And i LOVVVEEE you sooo much pls ansver
The dog is so lucky for being James' pet. Now I'm jealous 😭😭😭😭
Omg his bedroom
this is not what first time buyer houses look like😂😂
Hi, I'm your fan. Like: if you love james charles ♥ ️🥺because I do love him xd
His bathroom is bigger than my bedroom, okay James I see you making me feel poor
That dog 🥺 James, how much can I buy him from! Actually nvm, I’m ur sister so I can just borrow him     For 5 years 🤡🤡😈😈 LOL 😅
I seriously hope this does not come across the wrong way. I think this is truly great for James, but this is utterly soul crushing and I'm only 22. James is 21 and has achieved such a high point of success that I think for many people it has surpassed beyond inspirational to supremely unattainable. I'm a fan and am consciously happy for him, but the psychology of this is really tricky.
Of course he has an Xbox ppl jus make it too easy at this point
his room is bigger than my house
Are you single? 🏡
GK tau bilang apa, yg penting👍👍
i had the biggest smile painted across my face during the entirety of the video, it makes me so happy that he’s finally being happy and living his best life very few of us can have our dreams come to life, this video gave me hope that maybe mine will come true too someday ♥️♥️♥️

Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

When James started talking about how he likes that his parents room is farthest away from his own, I was thinking about how Jeffrey saltar would communicate with his parents room across the state.
James speaks very well!  Your house is stunning sister🌹
The master bedroom is bigger then my full house
What happens to all those sofas outside when it's raining? I'm so middle class I would never know 😅
Pinterest  Thats Pinterest 😂🤍🤍
Beautiful house but decoration is bland as! Zero personality. Looks like an ikea catalogue 😴
To think I share a bedroom that isn’t even close to the size of his bathroom, with two people.
it looks like a bloxburg house
I love how down to earth James is, and the fact that he could buy an amazing house like this in the first place is incredible, congrats James on everything and can't wait to see what you do next

I'm so jealous omg
Rent me a bedroom! can pay like $150 a week.
Of all the youtubers' house tour on the internet. This is by far my favorite. It's big, yes but it's livable. You know what I mean. Some houses are too big, they put random things in every room. But this one is very homey. Not a lot of clutter. And every room is carefully thought of. I would totally remember this video for when I design my own house. I want it to be this vibe.
waahhh your house is so pretty and like homey (?)
Wooowww niceee
OMG my family and I  need money but, really don't  have luck when it comes to giveaways but I  will  give it a try

Is this house same as the one Mr kare decorated or is it different? The entryway and living room is giving the same vibe.  I'm confused

James it is so wonderful to see how much you have grown personally as a person in just a few short years.  Your new home is STUNNING FOR SURE. When you said at the end that you were giving away 100 thousand dollars I was like "did I hear that correnctly"? That I had to go back a few time to re-hear what you said. Yikes and wowsa for me to wrap my head aroud that dollar amout is like something not attainable in my life. I wish you all the very best at what ever is next on your lifes journey. You are truly an inspiration to mysel. Bless you for just being You. You go SISTER. Everything you touch is Golden from your SISTER APPERAL TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL NEW HOWE.
I LOVEEEEEEE the theme of you house so much.

So pretty sister 😩💖
(Mark 8:36) “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" What will it profit you to gain pleasure, entertainment, popularity, riches, and fame for a couple years and spend eternity in hell?  This is for anyone reading this. Repent and get right with God today. Build a relationship with Jesus today. Time is short. Jesus loves you, which is while he died for the world while we were yet sinners. While he was sinless and innocent, he still died for sinners. Has anyone else ever died for you? Wanting assurance from the world won’t bring joy, peace, and happiness. Only Jesus will. I believe it’s a reason you have seen this message. Hopefully you will take heed before it’s too late. God bless
Literally a dream house😻 🏡
I love uuuu so proud of u ❤️❤️❤️
Congrats sis 👏 💓  love the vibe clean and simple 👑

Me when James says he's giving away $100,000: 😳 Whoever wins, congratulations!   Btw me and my sis both follow you on tik tok and insta and we subscribe to your YouTube!  My fingers are crossed!🤞🏻ꨄ If I did win the money, I would donate some to charity, give half to both my parents, renovate my room because at the moment I only have a bed and shelf in it, and save most of it for when my family needs it!
So far y’all  YouTubers with these new houses in 2020- are looking good and successful :)
How is it that we, the viewers, make people so rich & we’re financially struggling 🧐
James: we’re giving away $100,000 Me: chile, anyways         sign me up
I am so happy for you James. Living your dream and showing us that nothing is impossible if you work hard enough for it. Love you so much and you are my biggest inspiracion💕💕💕

Doesn’t anyone see the fact that this house looks like Rebecca Zamolo‘s house like bruh when I first saw it I was like that looks like Rebecca‘s house 😂
His room is bigger than my apartment.
This House is beautiful!! It kind of feels like a grown up james compared to the other house
James in this closet room thing: we are literally here all the time James in the living room: we are literally here all the time James in the kitchen: we are literally here all the time so apparently james and his friends and family are all faries 🧚🏼‍♀️
100,000 DOLLARS!?!?
We’re giving away 100,000$-   Ok Miss RuPaul
Loveeeee this house & how it’s decorated. Obsessed with how simplistic & “formal” it is. Lol can’t wait to have my dream home one day. 🙏🏾✨
$100,000 omg thats so much
When u said 100,000$ 😩🙄❤🙏 I automatically thought finally I can help my single mother buy her house or I can pay for my college tuition!!!   You are beyond generous! Whoever wins is BLESSED !!!! Winning will be a life changing situation.  GOD BLESS EVERYONE & GOOD LUCK 💗💗💗🥰 May the odds be in my favor , this all for my mother 💘💘💘🙏😇
Something about sister house that’s giving me a simple yet fancy vibe
Really beautiful home. I could use the money.🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
This looks so perfect I thought it was a display home 🤧
I can never understand how people can buy such luxurious things while there are so many people who live in extreme poverty
thats actually crazy how you growth that fast. Im proud of you James.
Bro it's everyone's dream house like what-
Im so happy for him. He’s been tore down by many big influencers, has been accused of false allegations (that has left him to lose a lot of his followers), but he kept pushing forward and look at where he’s at now! I’m so happy for u James!!✨💖
He should make a tik tok using the sound where it’s like yes I am obsessed but it’s ok about coke   I don’t think that the sound goes quite like that but anyways
you have came so far and the 100000 could help my family but a car ours just broke and my dads pay dropped so it would help so much please james please god
Love it!❤️
Omg I love this house!! Congrats sister💓💓
Goals 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I am so proud of you James!
James it would be amazing if you did gaming videos and always play the games that you want to play :)
Love da fit doe
Wow I loved this video one of my favs can't wait for the next    ( read my name btw )
James really said hardworking ✨
you should make your house in a roblox game called bloxburg 😏 a new yt ideaa🤍🤍
Omg James is soooo amazing I love it
Who thinks James brad mondo and hyram should collab
after looking at James Charles, I feel like a day should have 48 hours bcoz the worst part is he does his adorable makeup and the frickin' REMOVE IT. omg y.?!!
James Charles fans have to be the biggest idiots on YouTube
The home is beautifully styled but it feels so staged. James is such a  creative person I wish he decorated his home himself. That is part of the joy of owning your own space in my opinion. Making it feel homey
James i am so happy for u! U finnaly got ur DREAM house congrats
Omg😳
It must be nice to be rich XD
James I am so freaking proud of you!!!!
The only reason am going to enter the giveaway is so i can give my mom the money so she can finish her house in mexico 🇲🇽

I want to be guest, oh just joking love you
Hi James! I am absolutely in love with your videos. It's been a year since I have been watching you. I can't believe the sisters are so strong. So happy for you. Love you

When James has style
James really went and dropped a bomb on everyone and said “lol see y’all Friday ;3” 😂
I'd chop my foot off to own this house...

You paid somebody to organize your pantry? 😂😂

James
YES I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE FOR SO LONG :)
James
I just realized I want to be rich
I can’t name anybody that asked
I’m so happy for you ! Well done for hitting 20 million ! Your house looks amazing!
Shut the front door that would literally change so many peoples life's I honestly don't think I would know what to do with that amount of money 😲🤯 I would literally probably be scared to touch it because I hate spending any amount of money😅😂 that's freaking amazing though and so generous I know I have no chance of winning it though but it would be nice😜
All I got to say it amazing! It looks so nice! 🤩
And now he has 21 million
my family really needs that 100k. they think I don't hear them, but they really need it 🥺
this is so weird your a dude wtf.I just can't I just can't
The closet is twice the size my bedroom :)
Love you Jamescharles ❤❤❤
OMG ..!! Amazing James 🙈❤️
Me at 25 broke and depressed with no job n husband :(
I’m confused... isn’t the previous house his “first house” 😕
What are the odds I win 100K? Probably zero
It’s beautiful 😍 I
James Charles I love your vids your house is incredible I love it 🥰 soooo much you were the one who inspired me to do makeup 💄 and my first palette was yours and it’s my favourite when ever I wake up and see you on the screen my heart 💓 filled up as a marshmallow I love you soo much and one day I wish I can meet       you James you are super and I am the biggest sister in the world 🌍

Congrats- Gorgeous home!! You work really hard, well deserved success :) Random q to people lol- I don’t understand the random brand name books as stands for bowls and vases. Are these books they read or they just put them there? I feel like it does look pretty but it takes up table space, idk I’m not a home decor expert but just wondering.
Love ur new home congrats ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽
That was rude
Am i the only one who looked at his piano and thought, "What about the sister piano that the Dolans bought for you" :(
The emoji literally matched my reaction 😂 anyway love you James and ur house is  looking great✨❤️

If i left the doors open like that my mom would have yelled at me for letting the bugs in and letting the cold air out
HEY SISTERS!
If I won that much money I could finally buy my own house!😭😭😭
Literally 1% people who's reading  May your parents live more then 100 year with good health for ❤  (Btw read my name)🙏🙏
I would kill to live with James.
This is my dream house!! Love the interior design
His house is literally bigger than my entire existence 😭😂
He did not just leave us hanging like that......
One question. For the outdoor space, if it's raining do you have some sort of shade or any kind protection to cover the furnitures etc or did you just let everything become wet? I'm really curious.
James shows the living room: so this is my favourite room in the house   James shows the patio: this is my favourite room in the house   James shows the kitchen: this is my favourite room but the house
he said mookbong-
Can you make a video in where you try playing fortnite with your brother cause I really liked that video

His house looks like a house in bloxberg 👁👄👁
James: gives randomly $100,000 for no reason  Instant influencer’s winner Ashley: and you gave me only $50k after all that hard work 😒  Anyways, imagine being that rich 🤣

Omg I can't wait for the second part!!! Im in love with your home!!! So luxurious but classy 😍😍😍 n the giveaway what oh my 🤗🤗🤗
gorrrrgeeeooouuusssssss
its so awesome that he’s giving away $100,000 but it might be better off being given to charity. Even tho many families would definitely benefit from that money, i just think there are countries in need & other charities that would greatly benefit from it.     (just my opinion, he can do whatever he wants with his money)
At a young age you’ve got your own house ❤️ I’m so proud of you sister
Congratulations James!🦋
Oh, my Puri-Puri Prisoner.
😍😍😍😍😍
I joined the giveaway bc I have subbed for 1 year and a half. XD

What happened to Mr Kate and Ian??
you might not see this James but as someone whose dream has also been to get a real home since I was a kid, I’m genuinely so happy for you — your face is literally glowing throughout the whole video, and I would like to personally congratulate you, because even though I’m not a fan, I can truly admire how hard you’ve worked to make your dream come true. I was actually stressing about school right now, with everything going on, and was feeling pretty unmotivated, but watching your video really reminded me that if I truly DO want something I gotta learn to get my shit together and work for it, so thank you so much for uploading this ❤️
SUB to Triple Brothers!!!
Despite how absolutely envious I am of him---  I couldn't help but smile seeing that he was doing well for himself
I bought my first home this year too, it’s not as nice as this one.
You deserved this congrats🎉🎊💓
But I thought he bought his first house in 2018
Finnegan should have a little modern hpise of his own😊
This was so nice to watch. You can tell James is genuinely so happy with his new home which makes me happy for him 🤍
Okay...I don't know if y'all notice it or not but James's house looks like another version of Rebecca Zamolo's new house..😯 like the master bedroom is the exact same thing in both of the houses. But anyways they both are beautiful as hell and so much love 💖💖💖
Hi James you might not see this but my family and I have been struggling with car rent bills and food I was wondering if I could get entered in?
when earth is throughly fitted to that house .

James can I move in with you
[James goes into every room! ] James: this literally where we are all the time!  Me: sis! How do you stay everywhere all the time!  Like if you agree!

The closets bigger than my whole room
how does he not get tired from talking that fast lmao
Its a dream to not only be rich enough to buy a house like that and everything in it, but also be able to hire people that pretty much to all the work for you. the only thing you have to do is speaking up when you really don’t want or like something.  James! Your house looks beautiful ❤️
White, beige, black, wood, greennnn love itttt
Your house is my dream house!! We almost have the same taste if black would change into pink
hey james just a question love what you do but if you were to stop youtube and social media would the amount of money you have and still would earn from past videos keep you at a stable financial level for the rest of your life?? i don’t mean for this to be offensive and if you don’t want to answer because it’s to personal i understand. have a great day/ afternoon/ night/morning/evening btw i love the house lowkey want a house that looks like that in the future!!!

Yess sister
I don't think you should give 100,000 dollars away that's insane instead you should give away 50,000 dollars and with the other 50,000 buy some smaller gifts so more of your followers get prizes that's just my opinion well done for coming this far love your videos xx frankie

I’m not gonna lie I didn’t expect to see “to be continued” I said “what the f—- do you mean to be continue” i was just in the middle of changing my career plan back to architect.
This is how many times James said 'Formal'  l  l \/

The house and James are perfect 👌 😘
My dream is to also buy a home before I’m 25 but I live in Miami and Miami is a very expensive girl.
Beautiful house! 😍😍
James I love your beautiful home! I think it would be really cool if you had a hot tub on your master bedroom outdoor patio. 🤩

i was waiting for this video for a long time 😍😄✨
En serio queremos la siguiente parte, corrijo... Necesitamos la siguiente parte, 😂♥️. Besos desde Colombia, 🇨🇴.
Let’s just talk about the fact that you like talking to people who are younger than you and try to get was a 14-year-old
Is it me or the camera guy is drunk in the beginning lol
hii
I think James is the only person that I know of give away that much money😳
My bloxburg home be like
James: GO TO YOUR ROOM!!   Kid: *30 minutes later slams door*
oommggg i can't wait !!!! plz quick to download the continued of this video 😤😤😤😤😤 😩😩❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The house is beautiful!! Too many celebrities have overdecorated houses that are garish and busy and ostentatious. The interior decorators did an amazing job here. The furnishings and fixtures are clearly expensive, but everything is understated and classic. And the colour palette is so clean and soothing. The whole house is very classy and serene.  This clearly is a home, and not just a showpiece house.
Okay can we just talk about his GORGEOUS OUTFIT
This is hard to watch because um I have a small apartment and 2 siblings so yeah sigh 😔😞
Its always been my dream to own a house. That’s why I’m working hard to get into a good med school. Its hard sleeping till midnight but it will all be worth it. Congratulations James. 🥰💝
hii
ao my ghat  good
can we talk about the fact James is only 21 years old and he owns the gorgeous house!
His new house is literal aesthetic
What about his previous home? Was that rented?
He is only 21 and he has 21 million sisters

i wonder where the white piano is
So beautiful house🥰 god bless uh james
Congratulations wish you all the happiness in the world
If this is a fact, that you as a human being who is the world and the world is you, are living a life in which there is no psychological conflict, then how will you live a life without conflict outwardly? When there is no conflict inside, there is no conflict outside because there is no division between the inner and outer.
You are filming a 20 million subscriber special, and in 2020.      Sadly, you can only msg people in the USA and Canada... I live in singapore
This is giving me a major architectural digest vibes, like the camera angles and everything is so perfect.
Off topic but like does anyone else wish they had a comment section for commercials?
Hi sisters!
Oommmmgggg I am so look happyyy
that master bathroom 🤤🤤🤤
you are truly an inspiration for us!!!
I've been wanting a house like that since like FOREVER, and I'm only 12  Seriously James, you have an amazing house and amazing life and please keep making these vids  Yours sincerely, Sister Bethany❤️❤️
And I saw the bathroom and realised yeah thats how big my house is 😂😂😂😂 jk
100k ??? Are you kidding me !!! I would buy my parents a home, maybe not as beautiful as yours but here in texas there’s decent ones for around that price, but i would be happy with just a downpayment lol which in that case its 35-40k maybe ? Not sure .. but omg a house would be a dream come true, my parents have been living in apartments for 21 years already, im 19 years old and it sucks because literally we have 2 bedrooms, 1 bath, and its 7 of us living in the apartment. I’m studying for radiography but i still have 2 years to go in college ...
that looks like rebecca zamolos house?but it's still gourgese!!!
Omg I love James’s outfit!
So we aren’t gonna talk about the “Crown Apple or Absolute Orange”.. LOL Kidding we’re all adults here, well most of the viewers...right? 🧐 😂
G I love it it's so amazing 😍💙 your the best
I wanna be like James when I grow up
wow james! you have grown so damn much since everything happened from last year! you deserve this glow up so much!!! im so happy for you and your family/crew and i cant wait to see more!!!  this is called character development sisters.
When I saw: "to be continued" I was like: "why u do this to us?"
OMG he looks like Kris Jenner
That’s a lot of money- James congrats on 20 million!! And you are the official fashion queen can’t wait till Friday!
I can't stop thinking about how that fireplace looks like it's a spiderweb and the chandelier is the spider... LOL I'd be spooked living there
James house is absolutely gorgeous!
I don't know why but this video gave me so much peace that I needed it
Congrats

Can we just respect James for not showing his friends personal space, also I want to see the backyard so bad after the little peek 😂
This is a house where your lawyers walk around and hang out at, and stare at people that visit
My favorite part is the bookcase with the sliding ladder, I could only ever dreammmm of having that!
He has such good taste
Your home is amazing sister 💜💛💛💙💙💙
I’ve been waiting for this video for ages now and you’re just gonna leave me waiting a few more days 😭😭😭😭

love how james house is actually beautiful and realistic for his career and everyday life, instead of going overly the top with huge spaces that he's not gonna use or waste. It's so gorgeous too, perfect for him and his friends, so organised yet lively and modern with a dash of class. James is much too kind to do a $100,000 giveaway, like WHAT?
Not hating, just stating he obviously went for the "HGTV threw up everywhere" aesthetic 😂😂
Congratulations James. Your house is so beautiful. Wish I could own a house like this.
I really hope i could win that giveaway even though there's like a 1 in 10 million chance lol  edit: James's house is so nice! And white! I probably couldn't handle a house like that.....:(

Thank you for inspiring me and giving me the confidence I needed to go on my own journey, I will forever be grateful.

wow james house is so beautiful!!
RiOrganize seems like something I am too poor to understand
I’m so glad the “truth” came out in regards to Dramageddon. I was not a fan of James but certainly can appreciate his success. I still think Tati’s excuses were childish and unacceptable. Like, grow up ... you’re grown. Congrats James!
I’m in love with your kitchen!!!!!! 🙃🙃🙃🥰
Beautiful Home!! James recomending LeClair Decore Me looking around my 200 sq ft studio (sigh) 😔 Wait, how do i win the $100k lol 😂

I have another question!   TEACHER: Ok, ask.   STUDENT: How to put a donkey inside the fridge?   TEACHER: It's easy, you just open the fridge and put it in.   STUDENT: No sir, You just open the fridge take out the elephant and put it in.   TEACHER: Ooh...ok!!   STUDENT: Let me ask another one. If all the animals went to the lion's birthday party, and one animal went missing which one would it be?   TEACHER: The lion of course! Because it would eat all the animals.   STUDENT: No sir, it is the donkey because it's still inside the fridge.   TEACHER: Are you kidding me?   STUDENT: No sir, 1 last question.   TEACHER: Ok!   STUDENT: If there's a river full of crocodiles and you wanted to cross, how would you?   TEACHER: There's no way, I would need a boat to cross.   STUDENT: No sir, you just swim and cross it because all the animals went to the lion's birthday party please sub to me ! :)*

Hey sister James love your videos
🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡🏡
it looks like pinterest <3
I’m mad it’s a to be continued
Oh my god that $100,000 would literally change my life... As it would anyone else I'm sure. I just bought my first house too and already we're realozing there's so many repairs that need to be done.. We had a home inspector who didn't catch any of it but we need a new roof, foundation work, electrical updates.. It's stressful to say the least! Plus my car is on it's last limb, I've dropped more money into it to keep it running than the car is worth now. I'm so happy for you buying your first house James!! Mind you my 1000 square foot home would fit in your living area probably. 😂 But I'm proud regardless! Onward and upward James!! ❤️ ❤️
I loved your house

THE FACT i'VE TALKED ABOUT MY PROBLEMS SO CLEARLY CAUSE i REALLY WANT THIS GIVEAWAY....Everyone is this comment box is commenting that their whole house is smaller than your bathroom or wardrobe but I don't even have my own house...
wow the give away is crazy....whoever wins their life will be changed
Idea! James! Do some Wabicusa or garden esc. project with fancy nails!  Tip: use a straw to make places for your plants to avoid getting soil under your nails. If you choose to accept these are the rules: 1) You have to use some sort of nutritious substrate. (can cap it with something more clean and nice looking)). 2. You have to use live plants (can be just different kinds of mosses and you can make like a prop to make it a scene)). 3. Have fun and update us on how it goes in about a week! You can gift it to somebody or do like a household competition.
The house the colours EVERYTHING is BEAUTIFUL ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
imagine working and living with james, that would be so much fun ;-;, I'm currently surfing places cause of family. some people are living the dream Xc

oh god lovee jamesss!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. Non-Duality ✌️
It's so nice
Beautiful and tasteful...love!
James: my special video for 20 mil subscribers!!      Me: jaaaamees! You have 21 guuurl
I hate it when people do a house tour of their home and there's a lot of rooms that are absolutely useless (like a velvet, theatre room, a room filled with vending machines, spa room, etc) and the really "I'm Rich" shoved in your face. BUT I absolutely love how minimal, yet cozy James' home is. It also shows a lot about James and his personality. This really suits him! Obviously he's wealthy but he uses his wealth to invest into a house that actually functions (on the most part) of what a "normal" or an average persons home would and has the atmosphere of a real home. I love this house for you *Sister!!
People are really into that very clean and minimal look, huh
This just called me broke in 30 different languages and 12 different fonts 😌🤚🏽     Congrats tho!!!🥳
I love youuu
Just realized that James could be a realtor
❤️❤️❤️
So you’re still going to lie that this is your first house? You posted a pic saying you bought a house like two years ago. Now you’re saying this is your first home. One is a lie for sure.
James Charles is very good person....
никогда бы не подумала, что Джеймс будет жить в доме, где жили Nikol CrazyFamily
10:51 finn's ball fell off and i want 2 cry ;-;

That house looks so relaxing 😌 wish th best for you sister James
This is literally a dream house 😍😍
One day baby! 🤍🍾
That fit is everything
I like how James thought of his team when purchasing the new house and them having enough space to work and chill, rather than just focusing on himself. I stan the selflessness 🥰🥰
why im watching james Charles at 1 am
Why did I think he was giving away the house 😸🙈😀
James Charles : 20 million special Me: see's subscribers (21m)

"The addiction is bad but not that bad" me trying to justify my tiktok addiction

His house is literally every minimalist dream. 😍 And when he said he's giving away $100k?! I forgot how to breathe for a minute. I mean, that's a LOT for me. 😍😍😍🙏
I don't know why but it frustrates me that he has a beautiful kitchen and rarely cooks

Me when he says to be continued:    👁👄👁 💀

Hi
i’m so proud of him.
James you are ROCKING that blazer
Just a reminder -- don't visit his house uninvited :) I know he is popular enough for that to happen but it's his private space and it's wrong for you to just show up.
Your houses so amazing I am biggest fan of you and your makeup     lots of love from India❤
I think my favorite part of your house is your room. The outdoor lounge area seems so comfy and the full sliding doors geesh. I’m glad you have your own personal space and a wonderful area to reflect and hang out with loved ones.

It's such a beautiful home James !
always thought i wanted a cozy farmhouse kinda home but 👀 ITS THE KITCHEN FOR ME
Narcissism at its finest. I guess he needs all that luxury surrounding him because he's so cheap on the inside. Barf.

I just hope my children don’t say “this room is perfect for my parents because it’s it the furthest from my room . Nice and far away “ Parents dont deserve this to be said to them by their son .i don’t know what would i feel if my son says this to me .
Nooooo not a part two :(

Omg, Wait does James play animal crossing cause that sound effect is from animal crossing
Hi I love you James Charles I would like to be in the giveaway
Step one: Be James Charles.
Imagine like being his neighbor
why did i think he was gonna give away the house 💀
Jefreee could have more money but James’s style is immaculate: clean and simple
whenever i see videos like this i think about the energy consumption. a mini fridge, double bathroom, heated towels, all those lights, the sheer volume of clothes, a double washer dryer, the televisions and computers, two fireplaces...i wish someone as rich and influential as james would invest in solar panels or sustainable fashion...
I’m building this in bloxburg 💀
This inspired me to be homeless
You’re telling me the video just ends there👀
Hi James I love your house I can’t believe how far you have come I’m a very small youtuber :)
Omg your house is gorgeous 😩
This is literally the most modern dream house there is on earth😍
I love this house 🏠 happy 😊 1 week in the new house 🏠
Ahhh yes 😌 btw what type of breed is your dog?? And love you James you don’t need to change for anybody this also goes to everyone reading this comment do not change for anyone you are beautiful just the way you are 😊🤩💖

(Aren't I someone? Yeah) I'd (I'd) like to be your answer (Be your answer) 'Cause you're so handsome (You're so handsome)”

I love the piano song
Wow James! It’s touching to hear that your dream came to reality. We all have dreams as a child and wish that one day those dreams come true. I’m so happy for you and can see your glow watching you live your dream. I have always had a dream to own my first home as well, but college has set me back so much that I’ve lost confidence with myself. I live pay check to pay check and know one day I will live the American Dream! ❤️
beautiful home!
Gaymes with James!!
Yesssss girlll gooo offffffff !!!!!
My birthday is today
“ *coke cellar* ”
when your new house bedroom that is HUGE. and ur old room is smaller than his closet
Am I the only person that doesn’t like his house I feel like it’s because of I’m so used to my cozy little house and this reminds me of an advert it’s too white in my opinion it needs more colour even if it’s just some blue curtains

your house is a DREAM
The emoji at the end was literally my face when he said the giveaway 😳
Your house is beautiful and this video was so good, but did I’m hear you right... you’re giving away $100,000?! That would pay off my student loan and would be a good investment in my business 😭💕
This is cool, but you are rich and will be consumed.
Fruit of labor indeed!!! 🥰🥰🥰
wow his house is absolutely amazing
Y’all saying the bathrooms bigger than your room, the shower is bigger than my room 💀
I got confused in the beginning when you talked about the giveaway I could’ve sworn you were giving away the house ! I really do be hearing things lol.
ABOUT TIME!
I can never understand why white Americans insist on walking around the inside of their house with their shoes on.
I like that the house looks like someone lives in it, like not just this huge empty cold looking house! Lovely home!
this house should be named the sisters house or sisters hype
Loveee😍
Beautiful, God 🙏
this house is beautiful!!!
Ahem cough cough* so when u moveing out 😅😅
Love the house🤩

If you enjoy this, you should check out my Twitch stream. You probably won't like it as much, but I play games while blazed and the commentary is relatively entertaining. I'm streaming now and would appreciate your support! @Blazed_Glory

“Only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day” “good luck”
James, sincerely I want to congratulate you on this achievement. Its a beautiful house! Enjoy it!
Omg seriously. This cliff hanger is killing me!
I'm not a girl I'm not a sister
James has the vibe his house is a vibe everything about him is a vibe
James I would like to hear your life story how you got all the money and how you became a makeup artist and how you became so good at YouTube
WOW what a beautiful home!!! You deserve it!
What's it like to be rich
Congratulations sister! You deserve this and so much more!! Never change! I love you! Keep working as hard as you always have. God bless you always!💗💗💗
I'm confused... he said he had 20 million followers but he actually has 21.1 million!!! So proud of you James xx
I’m obsessed with the home decor so comfy and elegant 😍

This sister is so stylish and rich!! I love the basement! Can't wait to see it.

Thay outfit is beauty ly
Llyan Austria yuhoo
I am crying because I have never moved in my life :(
if i like enough "Only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day” i must become one
Bapity dapity
No wine in the wine cellar, but you have a few bottles of liquor by the coffee maker? I Stan lmfao
Imagine sister seeking in a house like this😳 a game of hide and seek between you and all your friends would be so funnn
🏡 is amazing ✨! So cute! 💕 👑
Me sitting here with my small house like 👁👄👁
I don’t know what looks better , his home or his makeup 😍
Y'all this was posted 6 hours ago and must of the comments are new 😳
im sorry, did I hear that right?😭 im shooketh. the giveaway teaser made me speeechlessss
Beautiful 😍
I LOVE YOU JAMES
“Only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day” “Good Luck”👩‍🎓
His house layout looks almost identical to his previous house, just a bit upgraded
Your house is beautiful
omg this looks similar to stephanie soo’s house 🙀🤭
::describes his house::  James: This IS the 20 million subscriber giveaway. This home....  Me: Wait... what?  James: .... has been my dream.
Love the aesthetic of this home! It’s so simple, and not too flashy like other youtubers! Stunning to say the least and very homey! And $100,000?! I would feel so incredibly lucky and blessed to win this but just the thought alone that someone will win it is like wow what a blessing! 💕
am I the only one who noticed that he said that California has lots of earthquakes but his wine cellar is not really stable for the bottles in case that happens?
Oh my god that give away would be a dream come TRUE. I could buy a house of my own on a teachers salary 🥺
Jeffree’s mansion is huge but so disorganized and the interior design is not really cohesive and is really a mess. It just that he has a lot of money and can buy random stuff for his house but it’s just everywhere. James’ house is so cozy and pretty and well designed
Anyone else bugged by the ONE Coke bottle that's off right by his head? haha
The vidoe we have alllll been waiting forrrr
thinking about all the college debt i can pay off and then some with that money..
James is to coke as jefree is to Red Bull. They should commercials
Definitely games with james!
House goals. I was happy to have my own house by 22 but shoot yours is a DREAM!!! ❤❤
so happy for you🤩❤️
bro you ahould buy paintings add some color and flavor. your place is drab and there are so many incredible artists whos work could bring life to the space. even if its still neutral minimal
anyone else feel like they were watching an hgtv house reveal?
Gorgeous home, it looks super cozy and inviting. I’m glad he didn’t go with an all white kitchen, tired of seeing the same color scheme of whites and blacks.
soooo I’m new to this channel may I know when can I get the subtitles...yeah?
I like how all the rooms go together.
*smiles in poor*
Well that would be a blessing to win and then I could pay you to do my makeup for me I hope you have a wonderful evening your house is beautiful can't wait to see the rest thank you for being so cheery and happy you make me smile
A hundred thousand dollars 😳
Omg I loved this video 🥳😊
Why is everyone here right now?
I love your house and I cannot beleive that you are giving away that much money! I cannot wait for the part 2 and to see the sisters headquarters.
Me lookin at his Guest room: 👁👄👁 that's prettier than my room
your house is truly stunning James. Good for you boo, we Stan successful queens🥰🙌🏽

“Only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day” “good luck”

This goes to show that you don’t need a “traditional” job to get what you want. Passion and Drive are key 🙌🏽✨
This is like a perfect not so big but big house since it feels homey and natural. It's just perfect lol

Wooooooahhhhhhhhhh
I hope I win like the house
The bathroom is the size of my frickin bedroom 🤣 James has achieved so much in his life so no hate at all!
Who thinks this is their dream house because it’s mine
The ammount of white in his house triggers me so much... not that i dont like it but because of all the stains it would have if i lived there
*When his living room alone is more aesthetic than you’ll ever be*
dang i meant an “!”
HOW DO U ENTER?!?!? AND CAN U make ur stuff more cheap and restock more often? And where can I get you pallette other that morphie
Congratulations on your new house
I'm just gonna dislike all comments I see that say something like "only one person that likes this will become a billionaire good luck"
Wish I could earn that money☹️
i love that he had it professional designed! it’s so gorgeous and really does look more homey than some of the other youtubers homes?
okay but i’m so proud of james and how far he’s come 🥺♥️
Your house is amazing !!!! I love it so much 🥺 and how do you enter for the give away or do you just have to be a subscriber to your YouTube channel ?

Woah wait this is a different house than the last one and just I’m realizing that Ofer halfway through.  They’re so similar but I thought this was just post-renovations. Is a whole ass different house?!?

JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMES he really left us hanging like that 😭😭😭
🏡🏡
Wat I love James but show us the rest of the house lrlase
Aparte de que no entiendo inglés james hablas súper rápido JAJA
hi i love your vids
James Charles house is a mood this is literally my dream house. If I couldn’t make it a reality I’m glad James did
OMG I'm sister shook... 😦 100,000 dollars... I can't wait to see what I have to do to get the money... My mom could really use it and I could finely get me some makeup and sister clothing... Eeekkkkk I can't wait   P.S. James house is incredible and I live the interior. (My dream is to go to college and be a home designer so that really inspired me)
How could you just leave us on a cliff hanger like that! I was looking forward to the makeup studio the most 😖🥺🥺🥺
I WANT MORE EPISODES OF BROTHER AND SISTER OR SISTER AND BROTHER 😭‼️‼️‼️‼️
Wow 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This house is goals!!!  💘 💘 💘
James is an amazing person. I don't know why people hates him so much. He deserves that 20m sisters.
LOOK AT THIS DUDE LOL
The decor in this house is beautiful... Love the black with the light wood theme.  Currently bought a home and this gave me inspo... Obviously I'll need a smaller scale but inspo still.
Like always being shady af I can’t belive you didn’t shout out Mr.kate
James house is soooo amazingly pretty !!! Also 100,000 is literally 3 -4 years of college 🤯
Did i hear that right or at the end  of his video he said he is giving away one hundred thousand dollars
His house is so cozy and homey I love it.
🎉🎉No honey it's 21 Million🎉🎉
James Charles low key turning into Mr. Beast giving away 100 grand lol
I won't mind if you 👍my comment James YOU ARE hot
“you get no money being a youtuber” James charles: has a whole mansion
Make to 20 mil turn into 21
It’s the fact the whole house is all white for me😍 personally I wouldn’t survive living in it bc knowing me I’m so clumsy that everything would turn dark in seconds, no matter how many times I’d clean😅
Is this the house that Mr.  Kate helped you decorate
It’s just me or this house looks like a bloxburg house😂😂😂 ps I love itttttt 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
James I love you I don’t want nothing from you keep the positivity and good vibes 🥰💝
I wish i can do her house like in bloxburg cuz its soo aesthetic and cute and cozy!!! Who thinks like me??
Love everything about this house literally!! I wouldn’t change anything wow 🤩 🤭✨

That's great
I love your house, reminds me like modern farmhouse chic! I love it ❤️❤️
This made me want to play bloxburg 😐😐

Still love it tho
who knew a house tour could leave a BIG cliffhanger 😎😎
how is this so beautiful 😍😍
Looks amazing!
Games with James plzzz
You had a house before this house I-
😇😇😇
His bathroom is the size of my room x2
James literally has my dream house
Why is everyone commenting the same thing?
Love the decor!!!!!
Why do all studio city homes look the same
I love how his house is big but not too big and it feels homey not like the ace fam where it feels like a museum and can’t touch anything
My man got a basketball court he playin with the wrong balls
This house is AMAZING 🔥🔥🔥 so happy for you and very well deserved!!!
I’m not usually a fan of light wood but it looks so good in there you may have just changed my mind!
I love your make up
Did he just say $100,000?! 🤯
Lovl 💕😘
Beautiful 😩🥰
the fact that he doesn’t have the sister piano in his house anymore :((
You’re my inspiration James
OMG IF I WIN I WOULD CRY BECAUSE MY BIRTHDAY WAS ON THE 13TH OF AGT AND THAT WOULD MAKE MY FAMILYS LIFE WAY EAISER
OMG James ur house is huge!
I’m so proud of James he worked so hard for this
Me: let's see what others say about this house in the comments  THE ONLY THING I SEE IS " only the person who likes this house will become a billionaire, good luck"
When it said to be continued 🤬
Wait he bought another house
Yo i would be scared to walk down the basement stares
Makes me so happy how successful James has become, I’ve never really been a fan but he just seems so happy and is literally glowing you go glen coco
YOUR 2 ON TRENDING
That “to be continued” was a different kind of hurt 😔
where the hell is the piano and bench that the dolan twins gave?
Wow I’m poor poor 😂 (no hate, just realizing what life could be haha)
James literally went thru hell in 2019 but came on top 2020 breaking records cause he is a bad bitch 😍💅🏻
You literally have my dream house 😂😂😉
love love love this house! what a dream!!!
Lowkey thought James lived in the hype house.   0.0 (Oop-).
You did not just to be continuedd thatt😭
When your house is the size of the kitchen
Don't take any underage boys in the bedroom
am i the only one who's confused on how he apparently just bought this house a month ago and that this is his first house tour when i remember him buying this house like 2 years ago and showing a house tour of it decorated by Mr. Kate 💀😐😑
james really did us like that 😔
Omg your house is everything 😍🤩! My dream house 💯
Now THIS is a dream house!
I swear I'm always late and I hate it
The size of this home is illegal
tu vine en Estados Unidos
me having my Sim do a house tour of the house I just made him.
Honestly this is my dream house 🥺 I love the interior design 😍😍 It’s so simple but sooo beautiful! ❤️
T- To be continued WHAT NO. I NEED £100k
I think I just found out/realized that his intro says James Chares instead of James Charles🤯
ahh when he was touring the upstairs i was thinking "hmm a makeup & filming room is missing" and turns out he has a whollee studio in the basement. cant wait to see it!!
Wish I could win. I could use the money 🥺
“Only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day” “good luck “
Is it me or is anyone else sad that they didnt see the piano the Dolan twins gave James on christmas :( No offense to james :) tehehe
Its awesome. Congrats!
Is so similar to his previous house
Tik Toc:  interior crocodile alligator I drive a Chevrolet movie theater  James: interior im a designer I decorate my house to look fire!!!!
100,000 dollars.... that’s like 5 years of me working my full time job... wow
100,000 SMACKERS 👏🏾

*BRING BACK GAMES WITH JAMES!* COLLAB WITH TECHNO AGAIN HE NEEDS YOUR CLOUT
I’m super confused. Didn’t Mr. Kate did  a full house WACO of this house?
Omg can’t wait to see the rest!!
Ok, this video inspired me a lot even though it is not done yet. Love you sister.
we love a sister that gives back <3
Congratulations James, you deserve everything in the world♥️ your house is gorgeous and I can't wait to see the rest😍♥️
Que envidia

James bathroom is bigger than my room
Ooooo talk about cliff hanger that was worse than watching a good sister show
His house is clean than the White House 😂😂😂
i’m poor
Aweee I got super invested xD
James Charles can you pls collab with Melanie Martinez 😀
Wait isn’t this his old house
You did not just leave us like that
I’m assuming the only one person quote is what we have to do for the giveaway?  ANYWAYS, your house is a dream, I’m so happy for you 💖💖
The house is stunning love love love
MINECRAFT MONDAY
James: every day casual closet Me: my bedroom is smaller than that closet😂 *No hate btw* 💘💘
james worked his ass of and finally he is able to purchase his dream house 🥺🥺
its 21.1 MILLION now
I did not come here for the money
James: 20 million subscriber special Me: but you have 21... you mean 21 million subscriber special?
-w- wow dat whole lot of money qwq Hewo
Only liking this for the Coca Cola cellar
You look sooooooo cool
I love that you put aesthetic & style to your home decor. There’s a sense of classic yet modern good taste. There’s nothing overly obvious designer (Louis Vuitton, Gucci) chairs  or very colorful walls & tacky decorations. It’s humbling to see a YouTuber own a home & had class towards it. You’re 21 & you make look owning a home so cozy & welcoming ♥️
anybody else feel like his house is eerily similar to Jenna's house?? hmm...
My house could never
Was not expecting that ending
james i love you
“Only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day” “good luck”

"OMG"  First of all I love your videos.  I love your house so much I think that it matches you personality and I just love it.  Congrats on buying a house.  I am super happy for you.  You are one of my favorite You-tubers and yes of course I am SUBSCRIBED and I think that everybody should because your at great person and You-tuber.  Congrats again and I wish hope you have a good rest of your day.🤍🤗😁

I want to be part of the giveaway
i am a sister fan since 2017 and we are still renting house when i was a kid i hope im the chosen one to win the money so i can buy my mom a new home coz that is our biggest dream :>
2:17 ahhh yes, the true classics, I’m in love😭
Really left us at a cliff hanger
The blazer is everything! <3
On god if I had 100k I would buy another mobile home 🏠 plus land I hope he got the land
I love the touches of beige around the house. It brings a lot of warmth to the home! A lot of people's houses are just black and white, and aren't as homey as yours.
Sorry that I didn't watch the video earler I was on online school but 100k 2 much😥😳
Did he not buy a house last year?
Hey James you prob won't respond to this but i would like to enter into the giveaway because my great gran has dementia  and we could save her with that money and we can buy the house that we rent! so yeah but i live in the uk
You’re home is beautiful 😍
OMG I HAVE BEEN WAITING
“I bought my first house!”  *Proceeds to give a tour of an entire city*
Your comment section is broken Sister
He’s now at 21 million!! Great job James :))💗💗
🏡🏡
The way James is showing us around the house is awesome! I’m sure he could be a great real estate agent!
I think Rebecca zamolo used to stay here
You have such a sophisticated style, your home is truly beautiful 🤍🤍 I can’t wait for part two and I’m especially excited for the give away !!! Congrats on 20 million 🥳💖
Congratulations James Charles
a coke cellar is what I NEED IN MY LIFE
Omg your house is so beautiful and you deserve every square inch❤️ I remember years ago when you did you downtown apartment tour then your last house and now this huge masterpiece of a home! I’m so excited to see how your career advances! And I will be there every step of the way❤️        ❤️Lots of love from sister Makenna❤️
James your room is literally the size of my whole house
ฝาก
Congratulations James Charles
Why did you do me like that James😂 I was excited to see the basement then it just ended😂😂💙
I love your house ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Wow
I’ve been following James for a few years now and I feel like a proud sister watching him grow to the level he is now. I ‘m so happy for him❤️
The amount of times he said luxorious
James be flexin on us
I am a daughter and my mom is a single mom, James's house is literally 100 times bigger than ours. If you ever want to support someone who is in need especially during COVID19 with my mom working 3 jobs 7 days a week then please contact me. It would really help us out as we are really struggling. If you could even give us a part of the amount that you are giving away it would make my mom and my dreams. So thank you so much for hopefully considering us!
why is everything writting about becoming a billionaire like i did miss sm?
Your house is stunning! Im so proud of you. can't wait to see more!😍
The people who want gaymes with james  👇
Why is everyone commenting "only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day" "good luck" ?? Ya'll realise James hasnt told us how to enter the giveaway yet right?? The info is gonna be in his next video lmao

YASSSSS sister this is absolutely gorgeous
It’s a beautiful house but it feels like a display. How do you live in a house that’s designed like sections of a furniture store? This isn’t hate, it’s just me saying I wouldn’t feel comfortable

Why do youtubers use their money like this and not their subscribers?! They are they reason they’re rich so why not get multiple houses for multiple people IN NEED of it.

Beautifully decorated
My house in bloxburg:
He deserves every inch of that house, may god give people like him more and gives us some too!!!
It’s mind blowing how every person that gets money gets these huge houses and uses MAYBE 3 rooms. While there are children in this world that are LITERALLY STARVING / America is FUCKED it’s all for show! I canNOT STAND that this is how human beings actually are.
u got me insecure bout my house now lol.
Glad he didnt choose entire white and plenty of marblesssssss
A 100 what!
His bedroom is like the size of my whole house!! Like omg! And that bathroom like wow and the closet oml
Love that it’s been decorated with taste not hot pink velvet everything

Good luck
Hi saybit back 👇
Only the person who likes this gets to be james charles bestfriend! Good luck!
I love that front door!! ❤❤❤
hi James! I love you and your house but as an interior design major, I cringe when people use the word design when they mean decor. The company that decorated your gorgeous home are decorators, not designers. Designers create floorpans, lighting plans (which is an art and science in itself, form elevations, sections and much more. Please use your platform to inform, not misinform. again, absolutely no hate, I just love to spread the word because its a popular stereotype :)
James is really living his best life, because he earned it and it's actually fun to see him showing his personality.💗  (I mean he shows it all the time, it just hits differently now)💗
“only one person that likes this will become a billionaire one day” “good luck”
His house is goalsss wth
omg your house is so amazing, the plamt pieces are just perfect, the wood work is amazing, the mirrors, the everything  This is everything!!!!!!

Many blessing James🙏🏻
When people ask me what my goal in life is I say to have a house like James Charles
No❤                                                      To all the haters💕🦋🍉🌺
Bruh, tf the only thing i see is”like and one day u will become a billionaire “
Omgg!!! Hi James pls respond Ilysm I hope u never end being a YouTuber
Wow. $100,000.00 seems like an amount of money that is impossible to have at this point for me. When I’m done with school I’ll be graduating in debt which is honestly so frustrating because you can work so hard but then have nothing by the start of the semester. I can’t even picture what that kind of money would do for me or anyone for that matter. I wish I could live a life with no constant worry of money...
"only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day" goodluckk
Yasss James

Uhmm James Charles my mom recently just lost her job for GM at Quality in and we live in a town house in new Cumberland PA I was wondering if you could give it to us because 3 cats my sister and my little brother and my mom and I think if she had a little more money like that she could get us a nice 1 floor home for all of us and if her boyfriend moves in with her he could come to my name is Gavin and I'm on my moms account right now She works really hard at her job but since she lost it because her boss is not very nice to her and she has asma attacks 😔 that's all hard for her plus now distancing learning on computer stresses her so James charles if you could reach out to me that would probably make my day for school tomorrow btw I'm in 7th

I’m not gonna ask for the 100,000 dollars because I know someone needs it more than me.
The white walls were probably a good choice considering the hailstorm of jizz they'll have to endure
Good luck everyone
Me and James house look exactly alike besides my cabinets in the kitchen and grey not like a smokey grey😌😌
My childhood dream house still is to this day 😍😼

Me encantan tus vídeos pero no te entiendo nada jajaja
the dog dropping its ball @ 10:55
Damn, that’s a nice house
"Only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day" " good luck"
Idk something about this house makes me feel sad. It seems like a lot of it is just for show, and not actually things you like. A grand piano when you don’t know how to read music, a wine cellar when you don’t drink wine, a huge kitchen when you don’t cook, an office when you don’t like to work in offices, etc. Don’t get me wrong, it’s beautiful, but doesn’t seem like a great fit. But do whatever you want of course, I hope it makes you happy
The coke cellar is soooo cute , love the vintage, beachy vibe!! I could just imagine the whole time you and your friends hanging out in these rooms! Cannot wait to see the basement and outside! Love it and love you🥺🥰🥳
Why is everyone writing about becoming a billionaire. Like did I miss sm??
“only person that likes this will not  become a billionaire one day” “good luck”
Finn so cute
This house is absolutely beautiful! Would be my dream to own a home like this 🥺😍
Ur joking to be continued I cant wait that long
"Only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day" Good Luck" 😍😎
"Only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day" "good luck"
I love this house its soo aesthetic
only one person who likes this will become a millione air...,,,, googd luck!!!!!!
We stan an unproblematic legend
PLSS BRING BACK GAMES WITH JAMESSSS
Wait did James said $100,000
Only one person out of the people who like this will become a billionaire. Good luck
Why TF is everyone saying the first person that likes this will become a billionaire like tf
It’s so gorgeous
Happy 21 million James
You’re House is seriously beyond GORGEOUS!  Congratulations you deserve it sister ! I love that you always give back ❤️
And it scares me how similar downstairs is to his old house like literally the living room 😳
All these comments sound the same😂
I love you sister  James you Inspire me so much I so ready for my YouTube to grow and my makeup to get better I wish I could meet you so bad
ok the house is perfect but that blazer and that top, do not work together...
I've been waiting months for this house tour and your gonna leave me on to be continued, this is exactly how I feel when I own family leave me on read😑🤣
Also I honestly just watch James YouTube videos so I’m very confused about the boys who also live there. What happened to his brother? Can we get a video about James team so I’m not confused with all these people?!?!
The house layout looks like rebecca zamolos house
That was an interesting move. To not need a wine cellar, but to put one in because it’s such an important feature in homes in CA. So if he ever moves, it’s much more likely to sell.
“Only the person that likes this will become a billionaire one day” “goodluck”
*What I think my house is gonna look like in Minecraft*

Hi sisters
nice! i really like the style of his house! fresh clean, simple yet modern. Very nice!!
so what did mr.kate do? did he buy a second home? new sub here
I just will never understand how or why he has so many subs🤷i just can't even sit through 5min of his dialogue without needing extra strength Tylenol. And out of all the well deserved blood sweat & 💧💧💧fashion icons that should've been chosen for camp they pick him???  So much lost respect for Met..
i just hope that one day my house can be as big as jame's closet
High key obsessed with the organisation of the closest tho🥺
Congrats on your new home :)

Glizzy reveal?

NOOO omg that cliffhanger
His house layout is almost exactly like Jenna and Juliens house 😭 so pretty
I love it! 🏡🏡🏡🏡
What a STUNNING home, James! Congratulations on your success x
When James room is bigger than your house ._.
This was really wonderful! I can't wait for part 2 😊 I'm so proud of you James and so happy for you. You are such an inspiration, not just for young people but people of all ages..I know you inspire me. Watching you inspired me to get back into the creative things I always loved doing and trying to start my own business centered around my artistic side and creativity. I had once let it all go in the hectic struggle of being a single mom. I was always made to feel that my artistic side was just a hobby and not something I could make a life out of. Watching you made me realize it's possible and to try...it's been difficult, but I won't give up...one day I hope to start my own YouTube channel doing and making creative things. My favorite being making natural jewelry 😊
NOOOOOOOOO I WANTED TO SEE THE WHOLE HOUSE IN 1 VID WAAAA IM NOT PATIENT
Whoever likes this will get infinite money in one day
sister your closet is bigger than my room NO CAP
you are glowin ✨ keep doin u
Dude
“only person that likes this will become a billionaire one day” “good luck”       If I see this 1 more time I’m gonna scream
Wait... what.....?!? Where’s the rest?!? James did us wrooooong! Hahahahahahh im invested, watching peacefully and u cut us off like that! Girll.....
It's it just me or does the layout of the kitchen/living room/pantry really remind me of Jenna and Julien's house? It's so beautiful
Such Beautiful home ♥️... congratulations to James.. can’t wait to see James personalises it with he’s character ... and some colour like he’s palette 🎨

If i get the 100 thousand dollars, i will be so very thankful 😢 i graduate from university 3 years ago, but i still didn't have luck to get any jobs. But i keep surviving, i just like u james. I like makeup more than anything in this world. I dont have a lot of friends. I only have my family to support me. Im financially broke 💔
I respect that he doesnt drink diet coke
Hmm bruh

Literally he had to leave us on SUCH a cliff hanger!! But seriously his house is STUNNING!
OKAY you’re rich 🤣
I love how you organized your oreos
when a bathroom is bigger than your room
I am super excited for you cause I knew you have come a long way and people doubted you but now they swear you guys were cool you went from making tuna sandwiches to making the news started speaking your mind and most importantly you prayed on your goals because without Christ nothing is possible but you channeled a positive attitude and you reaped the rewards of success but not everyone is going to be glad for you but don't let that ever stop you from shining my love ,you are unique , courageous and kind and you have inspired me and maybe one day I will love to be as kind and sweet-hearted as you you are a queen and don't let anyone tell you different you got an army and there are thousands of me in that army I love you sister ❤️💗💓💓♥️💖❤️💗💙💙💙❤️💕😘 xoxo james

Hey James, if you ever go back to gaming, may I suggest Persona 4 Golden on PC?
it looks like a showhouse you see at ikea rather than an actual house where people live.
the reason I love to watch you do these things and not others is your attitude. king. 😎✨
why is every comments: "Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire.” “Good luck"
Wait so who's house was he living in then?
congratulations!!! That house is beautiful!
Hey sister I just joined the sisterhood and I really want to try to get the money to get your pallet so I can try it you have inspired me I love and p.s you are so good you should do taylor swift's make up that will be cool well bye SISTER JAMES!!!!

This place is immaculate. Architectural digest is mad they didn’t hit u up before this vid
when he announced the giveaway, I instantly felt an overwhelming urge to win. I so badly wanted to study abroad, though due to the fact that both my parents came from impoverished backgrounds they weren't able to provide us a better education.
Hahahahaha “coke cellar” hahahahaha
Stunning!!!😍

Sister James your making me sooooo jealous like that house is magnificent and as beautiful as you are I hope you make great memories in the house or do I say mansion.
It's just the fact that James said that they will be giving away $100,000 and I'm more focused on the in home movie theater 💀

The fact that it takes 17 minutes to show your house is crazy and there being a part 2

shore
Aww I love your house it really inspires me so much😣❤️
Amazing I love it sister
Sister that house is EVERYTHING!!! Ive been subscribed to you since Day 1 and im so proud of how much you've grown and didnt let the negativity affect you in the past... as a matter of fact it made you stronger and wiser and that is simply inspiring. I know this video isn't your giveaway yet but im staying tuned because that money would literally change my life!! Im a 28 year old single mom living in the Midwest working a minimum wage job and your videos allow me to believe that my dreams can come true if the opportunity presents itself. I've been obsessed with makeup since a little girl and never had the capacity to start my own channel or anything... your giveaway could help me follow those dreams to maybe one day have the same things and house you do! My intention is to invest, not blow it on nothingness. Invest in my dreams. Thank you for being my friend, without knowing me personally, and helping me realize im capable of anything. Xoxo Ellie.  IG AND Tw: she90svibin
That house is a dream 😩

Congratulation to you I can see the effort you put into everything like if I was your parents I’ll be so proud of you Sister I know they are proud of you
$100,000 would really help me to buy all the baby stuff that I need.......stresses me out that I might not be able to give my baby what he/she deserves because of my financial situation 😔
James ur #2 on trending!!!!!!!!!!!!!🥳
🌈
whoever likes this will become a millionaire one day.
I love how everything looks so basic but he loves it, and that,/ what really matters, James is now becoming and adult and probably surrounded with people whom toes are on earth, 🙌🏽
Did the oppenheim group sell you this home
“The coke cellar” We know what you thought hunny ;)
ugh, what it would be like to have that much money and not have to worry about how you're going to pay rent lol. He works hard though so he deserves it.
You know you’re rich when you have two vanities all to yourself 😹
That kitchen is gorgeous n amazing 💋💜
I loved your house. Omg it’s just all part of inspired by nature. Love you

Me waiting for him to start singing in the bathroom
And that is all thanks to us...I guess..😅 you're welcome
Ok the cabinet layout of thr hallway before the formal office reminds me so much of sharpays trophy area at the high school musical 2 country club
Friday?!😠

Omg I loveee your house it’s amazing
"Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire." "Goodluck" <3 <3
I find it incredibly inspiring that James purchased a home, especially being so young! I think its a great impact on his audience to realize that making money is one thing, but investing money and owning your own things when you get the chance is one of the best ways you can give love to your future self. So proud of you James, from one 21 year old to another!
Your home is so beautiful!!! What a dream.
I wonder if James will make a brand apart from sisters apparel, if he wants to make a fashion brand or smth like that :0
Im 6 seconds in and its already so cute
Games w/ James
This is mind blowing
I love u James but u show the backyard?😥
coke seller ?!
Fin is a teleporting dog :o 10:46
THE ENDING NOOO ICANT
That is a gorgeous home.  I'm glad you realized your dream of owning one and hope you enjoy many wonderful years there.
Am I the only one who saw the rainbow purse, ok ok I’m sorry 😂
I love the layout of the house and the colors that he has chosen for it as a whole! It definitely shows who he is as a person. I can't wait to see the rest of the house!! Watching this video really makes me miss my homestate...

The original, creative and actually funny people aren't here yet in the comments. Bots and attention seeking people, back off for now byee.
You know it would be a dream to win 100,000 dollars! Like WOW! seems unreal to even think about it happening lol. It’s my dream because my mom is poor she has no money, so she’s really sad all of the time I think.
I WANT TO SEE GAMING WITH JAMES!!!! START AN ANIMAL CROSSING SERIES SISTER
I love this video ❤️ this video is very inspirational to me because it really shows me that if you really put your heart and soul into something whatever it is whether it’s youtube or school. You can truly build an empire off of it 👌🏼💕🙏🏼
Woow James super happy for you. You're still so young and have accomplished and overcome so much. Your new house is AMAZING and I love it soo much definitely my dream home. Congrats.  Love your videos and was super shocked at the end for your giveaway   Whoever wins will be extremely blessed.   P.S . Right when you recommended the organizer i jumped on IG to follow her. I love it, that would  another great job for me of course besides building my youtube channel.
Wow. That interior design and the vibe is amazing 😳😍😍😍😍😍♥️

I hate you I’m not gonna check you on Instagram oh I got a notification from Instagram cupcake just said come and check me on Insta I think I got a new picture uploaded OK titan I’ll come in in Y minutes
Damn can I be a winner 🥺
i want your house!!!!!!
I got so mad when he said “to be continued, see you Friday”
I could use that money for the house I’m buying lol
2:20 thats a riff right there,
I don’t even really watch James Charles tbh, but I like how humble the title is and how grateful he is to his fans. He’s definitely grown as a person.
Where did you get all the stuff in your house like the bed the master
$100,000 that’s literally so crazy oh my gosh 😱💵💵
Yea do games with James like if you agree❤️❤️❤️
I would be concerned about security with showing off such a beautiful house. 😩😩😩😩😩

Your home was so beautiful!
Duuuude this house looks soooo much like the first one did
I’d be so annoyed if I was James Charles rich and bought a mansion, but then it was always crammed with people working. His house feels more like an office than a home

I want to warn my bad English but I'm  watching James a very long time now..although I am a Korean middle school student. After watching quite a lot of his videos James seems like a really nice person🙈💗 and I love his fans how open minded you guys are..some people in Korea actually hate man wearing makeup😥 BUT the world is changing and for me James was a big help for discrimination in Korea!!   I love you James:) keep going ☺

I love this so much, so proud of how far you’ve come james 😽
why do u need a bigger house when ppl are starving
James outfit is cute though I need it!!
I absolutely love this house!!
james really said ✨ c l i f f h a n g e r✨
“Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire.” “ Goodluck “

So happy for you James Congrats!!! 🎉 you deserve this and so much more💗💗

Good Luck Sisters!
you should do a make up relay with your team
I like how James recommended his interior designers for when we are looking for a new house... but then I remember I’m poor and can’t relate.
The aesthetic of this house is literally what I strive for one day!! 🏡 Beautifully designed and so organized!! ✨✨✨
I am just so angry with non heated towel rack now. 🤬
100,000 DOLLARS OML
That’s a beautiful house!
The pantry  areas is called a Butler’s pantry
thru out the whole i just felt poor lol
wait doesn't he already have a house????
when my whole house is the size of his kitchen
So nice!!  🏠 🏡
and thats on a ✨broken✨bank account
I actually love how his house is so like homie and warm and not strictly modern all throughout :)
It's so lovely and cozy!
Wow amazing
Your home is soooooooo beautiful 😍😍
It's  the way he's  celebrating 20million subs and four  hours later he's  at 21million.   Also i choked when he said "coke cellar" skskskks
James you know everybody hates to be continued James I love you but who wants a to be continued when we’ve been waiting for this for so long

BEAUTIFUL HOUSE SO FAR!!!!  Can’t wait to see the rest 😍😍  At the end my face was like 😳 okay okay 👏🏻
I literally love your house. I’m just barely away from 18 but I’m going to college for YEARS 😂😂. However I’m literally imagining my future apartment/house/s haha. And this video literally gave me soooo many ideas. I love it. Genuinely thank you, because your home is beautiful. It’s truly a home it’s cozy yet elegant if you know what I mean.
I'm Sister SHOOK!!!!
I literally have been designing my home with the natural wood, black accent, and neutral colors too!! Love this aesthetic!
James is amazing and has such a beautiful house
Why does James room look like a room that would be on a magazine
We love an independent sister  we are so proud of you james

Congratulations! You have a lovely home. My favorite space is your bathroom and closet!! I'm not sure what that says about me. Hahaha! Finn has grown! ** pets the puppy **
wooooow ONE MF DAY what a dream !!!
How do we enter the giveaway?? Btw am I the only Person that made this emoji 😳 every time It popped up on the screen? 😂 I love James and I don’t think - I KNOW he will become the best fashion grue to ever exist
Aww You’re just like Trevor’s guardian
james saying because he's the only one in his room, the bathroom is "His and His" forgetting the fact that even if he lived with a boyfriend it'd still be "His and His" is so funny to me
honestly needs more birkins in that closet
This is how many times james said this is one of my favorite place in the house | | | |
It's a real pleasure to see someone so well on their feet and realizing their dreams at the age of 21. I'm very happy to see all that he accomplished; it's great to see good people doing well. High five, James, you absolutely deserve this! 🖐
omg congrats
i love ittt
i want 100k lol
Charli would love this ❤️
I know he did not just say 100,000 dollars. If that’s not fully loving your fans and giving back to them then...idk what is.
I love how he has a kitchen that’s bigger then my living room but doesn’t even cook and then theirs people like me who love to cook and their kitchen is barley bigger then his butlers kitchen
I'm so proud of you James. You deserve this and so much more!❤️
Ok I am not American so I have a question: do all Americans wear shoes inside the house because it really triggered me to see him walking on a white carpet with shoes
I cant wait to see the basement 🤩🤩🤩🤩
It’d be a dream to have such a house like that. I hope you enjoy it with all your heart. This is the kind of house I’ve always dreamt about and it’s amazing. Everything fits to what I want for me in the future, I hope God helps me (He will) in building it such beautiful as yours.
that coke will only last a day
Me: enjoying video Video: To be continued... Also me: *cries*

James! Your house is beautiful the SISTER house will have many memories!💖
Can I come to your beautiful house sister james🔥💞😍😍😍🤗
Oh my gosh! What a pretty design. I really love the peaceful little area above the flight of stairs, and your resort-like bedroom. You could totally get rid of the wine storage all together if it’s not something you’ll use. I wonder what it’s like to live with your colleagues/friends and if it’s hard to strike the right balance when those lines are a little blurred. Very interesting and sophisticated home; congrats James!
... so it has almost the exact same layout as Jenna and juliens house...
YEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS
Your house so so beautiful! Congrats to you! You are truly blessed.
This is the motivation I needed, thank you 🤍  Congratulations on your beautiful home!!
Games with James please!!!!😍

Okay, live everything but that tv in James room is wayyyy to small. And the Listerine bottle on the counter is not it. Looks trashy, keep it classy.
SISTER: STUFF THAT BIRKIN. Storing it like that is a crime.
The style of this house is everything!!!!!
Beautiful home, well done James, deserved and respect to you for being focused and driven from the start x
What a gorgeous house you look beautiful like always I lost my husband and my 3 sons I could use that money to survive I love you 💖 james 👍👍👍

Wow 20 bill this is insane
OMG UR HOUSE IS GORGEOUS!!!!!! LOVE U JAMESSSSS!!!!!!!
I wasn't into the whole youtube beauty community until 1-2 years ago - needless to say I had to catch up on a lot of drama. I have to say James Charles and Bretman Rock are my favorites. I'm genuinely happy for them and who they've become. They seem like good people idk?? With all the mess going on in this community they seem like the most genuine of the bunch.   Also I love his dog omg soooooo cutie patootie
you can stop talking like a host now hahaha
Now compare James house with Jeffre's house... James wins coz he has better taste!
You sister snapped on your house!!! Love you! You deserve the world!
James your home is very beautiful💋
You inspire me alot
James, if you are seeing this, I want you to know, you are worth it. You get a lot of hate and I don't know why. You have such good vibes and always manage to stay positive. I love you James. 💗💗💗💗
i swear he said 20 million and i just checked at like 4 hours after this post and it says 21m
I’m so happy for you James like it is so crazy to think just a few years ago I decided to watch this new YouTube who seemed cool little did I know you were amazing and I can’t believe how successful you have become love you always
I know a cozy home when i see one
Loveee this house and the layout is right on point 🎉 First above anything I absolutely love how you have included those pictures adding even more of yourself to your home. 💗 The kitchen is gorgeous and a house is not a home without a fireplace 😍 Every room has a personality of it's own and the backyard is lit 🎉 🔥🔥 Have a wonderful night, Sending lots of love 💕
I had the biggest smile on my face🥰 and was clapping and saying “you deserve it all James”🥳🥳🥳  and then he said part 2😐💀
What a beautyfull home James, i am verry proud off you. Wish you nothing but the best🤗❤
This home is absolutely stunning!!! I love how minimalistic his room looks as well!

Si entro y me robo un zapato, ya puedo pagar mis estudios
Dude his room is bigger than my house-
lorddd, that house is gorgeous!! especially that kitchen!! i cook and bake a lot so that would be my dream kitchen!
""" ONLY PERSON WHO LIKES THIS WILL BECOME A BILLIONAIRE " 💖LOL  LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS
i think the house is very minimalist and i love it. Hi sister James from argentina
Beautiful house 🏡 sister
who is here when he has 21 million!
Hi James and sisters ! I’m not consistent w videos but can someone clarify what he means when he says “us” and “we” .. roommates? Or
Wow I’m so proud of you !!!! You post the video 3 hours ago and now you have 21.1million subscribers!!! Wow !!! I feel so happy
I loved everything about this home...I mean everything!!
Hey James not to be picky. But me and my family need money respectfully. We are almost out of money for rent. And my mom can’t work. So it would be an honor if you can send 100k to us :(
Why did I think this was just the same house but newly decorated.... also I totally thought he bought the last one
when James’ closet/wardrobe is bigger than your bedroom 👁👄👁💧
Live chat?
More cooking vids????
Absolute beautiful home, James. It made me think about all the money and devotion that went into creating this beautiful place
Why am I only thinking about how expensive the marble must have been
YES GAME WITH JAMES (simping for the past to come back)
💖💖💖
Where's the wig closet?
Can we just appreciate his beautiful home
Is it just me or does this house look the exact same as the old house
Wanna hate on him keep it up cause you don't what a nice person he has become  HE IS LEGIT GIVING AWAY 100,00 DOLLARS :0
i’m just mad we have to wait
James calling me broke in 1230 languages
yesss i love house tours anyone else? 😂
did he just say 100k oml oml oml
When’s part 2 coming out
Is it just me or does Finn also match his aesthetic 🤣
I LOVE IT
I mean I wish I didn't miss cuz I love your makeup videos and stuff what you do really cool
Omg I love it! I’m so happy for you! Congrats on 20M!!!♥️♥️

nasi temizleyecekler simdi bu evi
That house is so nice😮😮😮😮
i was just watching clips from the late late show and lowkey was confused reading the comments abt james bc i was thinking of the wrong james lmaoo
I’m like no I want to see the room nooo
Such a beautiful home!
I just went to your first video james and no offence but 🤢Yicks lol
Didn't Mr. Kate do a couple og rooms too? 🤔
<3
not james’s master bathroom being bigger than my room...honestly, go you james! this home is beautiful and you deserve it 100% :)
I'm absolutely loving the aesthetic on this house.the wood tones with the beachy vibe colors is definitely a more adult and grown look. A lot of people tend to just go towards the black white gray modern chrome look and I'm really loving this look. It's gorgeous and I am so very happy for you you deserve nothing but the best and I would definitely say you're not and inspiring fashion guru you're already there lots of luck and happiness in your new home
I love ti
This house is literally my dream home what the fuck. IT'S SO GORGEOUS!
Congrats on your BEAUTIFUL house James!!!🎉🍾Can’t wait too see the SISTERS HEADQUARTERS👀

Charles

All of you that think James is doing a $100,000 giveaway
Isn’t this similar to vogue🤔( vogue is a YouTube Chanel wear they go to celebrities houses and asks them question while they get to explore the house)
the fact that his closet is bigger than my room is sad
The house is stunning 😍
James is living on a pinterest page

Beautiful, Homie, simple, classy, comfy that's the summary.
Hiiiiiiiiii Sisterrrrrrrr!!!!
congrats jamess
Who ever is recording should start an aesthetic tt account
James charles give me a shout out pls
It's quite sad that homes nowadays look all the same. Lots of white, add some black and some brown or tan color. Anything metal is black or gold and the plants are all the same too. Add some marble and you're good to go.   "The interior designers suggested to add a personal touch from me." Uhm. Yeah. It's your house. Your house should be 1000% your touch
I was waiting for the cinema =))
This is so pretty! Good job James!
Am I the only one that see james just has  gold bars laying around his house 💚🤑
I'm in love with your house James omg I am sister shook rn ❤

Omg I just got to the end! $100,000 🙀🙀🙀 that emoji was definitely meeeeee
My sister James is the best YouTuber ever. All I see in him is that he's The nicest. The prettiest.the most talented of them all,so please give him love and support because he deserve it( a lot). BTW I love your new house. Kisses, your little sister joudi  "malika "❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love how simple but extravagant it is at the same time. Absolutely stunning! 💗
YOU PLAY TOO MUCH JAMES Talkin about some “To Be Continued” uuhhhh 🙄😤😒I guess I’ll see you Friday 🤣
Omg, this is insane James, ily sm and I'm so so so happy for you!
Anyone else here feel like if they had that many book shelves they'd put books on them? I live in such a small space, I wish I had that much shelf space
James is really clever. He managed to stick in, what, like 6 diff ads in there and he’ll get 4 million plus views on. Plus he seems to be getting that Coke money by plastering it throughout his video. This video alone will likely get him $100,000 he’ll give away. But he was clever enough to do it in two pieces so he can repeat the process (multiple ads and in-video sponsorship(s)) in the second part of the tour video to likely pick up another $50,000+. It’s great. It just worries me that money is being made so easily off of not providing a lot to the world. It’s just pure marketing and selling of things we don’t really need.
take a shot every time he says "formal"
When his bathroom is the size of my room
What are the actual chances it is going to be me for the giveaway
I love your house and if u reply I will keep watching u 😃🙂😊

Congratulations James taking notes from your young entrepreneurship
Does he have a roomate?
You should hire someone to cook dinner for you 3 times a week on work days and teach you basics you love to snack on for lunch or breakfast when you have free time. That way you convert your diet to something a bit healthier for your needs as you age.
Woww 😍😍 congrats!!
Please do a hide and seek in ur house xx

OBSESSED UR HOME IS SO BEAUTIFUL
James should be a realtor😳
i've been following james since 2018 and  im so happy to see his growth
If James was a real estate agent I would def buy the house ... love the way he shows around ❤️🤪
Rumah impian.. Simple.. Gak serem..
Love the coke cellar.
As non-American I'll never understand random books spread across coffee tables as decor, and bookshelves that have everything but books (I watched many AD open door videos and noticed these moments with celebs).  I will also never understand trend of paying random people to organize stuff inside my home. I want to decorate my place. That is the whole point. :D  Nonetheless, congratz on reaching your dreams. :)
imagine having closet doors inside of your closet door 👁💧👄💧👁
i love him so much 🤍🤍
EEEEEE such a cute home. I hope you make it your very own and have great memories in it!!! Have fun!!
so impressed at everything he has achieved and this beautiful home despite all the downs. much love James!
Me the whole time 😳
I would love to win it to buy my parents a new house or for bills !

Congrats on the house James IT'S STUNNING 👑 also James please let me stay in you guest room- I won't say anything I promise I'll stay out of your way-  I'LL CLEAN YOUR MAKEUP BRUSHES PLEASE

thats the slowest intro he ever said. hi sisters! james charles here!
James was Playing Making my way Downtown in the
it’s so gorgeous and cosy OMGGG
Anyone else aspire to have a house like this

Are you by any chance neighbours with jenna & Julian ? Ur houses seem identical.
Literally house goals
I love ur house James!!
Hi James Charles. Thanks for curing my boredom with your wonderful smile and Amazing house! Stay blessed Shorty 😉
I love you james and no matter how much i want the money you really should keep that because thats ALOT

🏡🏡
That's not a home that's just a show home...:(

A house that isn't so big that 50% of it won't be used..Just nice too see. Seems like this day in age the bigger the house the must. However, if a huge house is for you go for it. :-)

James I love u but ur house has no personality. It’s like Nice House™️. I guess it’s just not to my taste but your house is so impersonal, I’d feel like I was living in a lobby.  Edit: wait, I didn’t mean it, pls give me that prize😳

Hi James I watch Norris nuts and when you judged them in make up naz was blessed that you did that and your house is so so cute
I really got emotional, just because the fact James has been through so much ! And honestly just deserves this magnificent blessing 🥺👏🏼❤️
This called me poor in 100 different rooms
This place is ACTUALLY incredible
him saying his biggest goal is to buy a house and saying its absouloutly insane that he bought a house
I wonder How much did that house cost him !?
WOW JUST WOW.....BEAUTIFUL HOME😍🥰 SUPER COZY ASWEL😊😊

James would make a great real estate agent tho
God he’s good at piano
I’m confused He bought this home and says it’s his but I thought he bought the last one?  Is this one a new house? Looks like the same layout
a TRUE SISTER - hustler. ❤️ love how the house turned out! He definitely deserves it.
Its the bedroom the size of my classrom for me
I would never leave my house if I lived there, I mean I barely leave mine now and its more or less the size of his room lmao

James you definitely know your style cause its beautiful
Saying you’re 40 and living in a basement would honestly be the biggest flex if it were this house’s basement
Sisters shook 👁👄👁
His guest room is better than my bedroom
its the shoulder pads for me
This is exactly how I would decorate a house and how I will probably decorate my house in the future. For now I stick with small dorm ideas. Also your outfit is amazing. You look polished and fancy  while also throwing in your own style. I think clothes are a form of good manner and you constantly kill it!
His wardrobe is bigger then my room..
Also I love your house! It is absolutely perfect! My dream house is much like yours!!
Sister james: buys a house Me:can't even afford a McDonald's

y’all stop commenting saying “What about Kylie? She bought a house way younger than James.” Oh man guess what this is James Charles YouTube channel and comments not Kylie I love Kylie but Kylie and her sisters all took advantage of Kim becoming famous and started their own business and became popular after the kardashian-jenners became famous without Kim none of the sisters would be were they are Kim started their career while on the other hand James is self made he never became famous by anybody so stop comparing them (much love to Kylie this isn’t hating on the.)
Talented sister even picks out good real estate. 👑
OMG REBECCA ZAMOLO HAS THE SAME HOUSE
After watching selling sunset I view this so differently 😂
$100.000 , I am definately IN. Haha. Ly James.  ♥
Why so much money tho?

OMG yess sister

I NEED THIS HOUSE
Beautiful home!
James definitely knows how to live in style 😍
You left me shook

The style of the home layout looks so much like Joey graceffa and jenna marbles home do you guys live in the same neighborhood?
Ok James have a bathroom the size of my bedroom 🙄  Hehe jk lol this house is so impressive and although I’m not a OG fan ilysm! So proud 😚
It gives me anxiety to see people with fully furnished outdoor spaces being from the UK. Like, what on earth do you do if all that white stuff gets rained on? Also, congrats on your first home, you've definitely worked hard and earned it, so well done!
wow, absolutely stunning! I’m in love with the colour scheme. it’s so chic. obsessed!
I fall in love with this house. It's sooo gorgeous 🤩
Ngl I thought James what going to give his  palette or something like that, not $1,000,000,000 I'm sister shook

Wowowowowowow, so james shares his home with 2 of his workers..? I'm sorry but i would feel so uncomfy in my own house, like can he even walk around in his underwear, bcs i do that all the time
It makes me sad to see the materialism.. These huge rooms that aren't used.

James: this is just a little area back here not really anything interesting there. The “little” area: bigger then my f*cking house
Kylie was born into wealth. James worked his way to it  BTW: I respect Kylies hustle... but from a personal perspective working very hard is more respected  And I said Kylie because someone in the other comments did 🤦🏽‍♀️ lordy agree to disagree. Everybody has an opinion.
James is literally the most hard working YouTuber ever I don’t get how anyone could hate him
These is one of the few expensive houses that are actually cool,it’s simple and modern at the same time,some ppl buy unnecessary expensive stuff for their houses and end up making them look weird, everyone has their own tastes tho.
Ahhh this is so huge we’re so proud of u sister you are so talented and kind and amazing and all around the best person ever I love you so much keep working hard luv ya sister 💗❤️💗❤️💗❤️💗
This is my favorite you tubers house ever

His taste has changed so much but in a beautiful way
Me living in a one room apartment with 4 people 😳
Can you imagine actually being lucky enough to win $100,000? I would have a lot of my stress and anxiety taken care of and my hair would finally stop falling out from trying to make it in this expensive world on my own

James's personality is rlly glowing in this xD
Absolutely beautiful 😍😍💜💙💚💛🧡❤️
everyone when the video ends  whyyyyy
hey James, like every other one of your 20 million subscribers I'm entering your give away. I know I'm definitely not going to win because you've got 20 million subscribers, CONGRATS!!!!  And know I'm going to tell you why i think i should win. First of all you are my IDOL and I'm not saying that because i want you to choose me I'm saying that because its true, I've been subscribed to you for 3 ish years now! you inspire me so much to start doing makeup but I don't have a lot of money to pay for it :(. So if I won I would definity buy : ALL your makeup/merch, and help pay for a house -> me and my mom live in an apartment (since we don't have a lot of money) and we are looking to move into a house since we've got a lot of animals: 2 dogs (Bentley and Katie) 1 cat (Bella) 1 rabbit (gizmo) and a HORSE (Montey)! And before anyone asks no the horse does not  live in our apartment, he lives at someone else's barn that we pay them for him to live there. even a reply from you James would be a miracle. anyway there are probably people who need the money WAY more than me but it would really help me. p.s sorry for bad grammar I'm 13. I love you so much James and ill always support you!!!  - your literal biggest fan Lily <3  ps (again) I follow you on tiktok and Instagram and subscribed like 3 years ago.
This house!!! such a good job James, and that giveaway tho... see u friday ooof
one hundred and thousnd dollars ?! he rich af, im deff going to participate lol

I bet the haters are crying. Proof that hate doesn’t stop people from thriving! I Love you sister James 🦋🤍xx
All I could wish for in my future house if I am ever lucky enough to get one. Is a big soaker tub and nice shower. I could have a tiny closet and still be so happy if I had a big tub lmao.
ITS SO AESTHETIC;OO
James please all I want is your piano
watched the whole video just for it to say “to be continued ....” JAMES!!!!! Don’t do that to meeee
His bathroom is bigger than my bedroom-

such great and exquisite taste 😏🤍 while others spend a fortune on a hideous versace couch 😅🤡
i hate being broke.
“ Only one person who likes this will one day become a billionaire” “good luck”

The staircase downstairs give me radio rebel vibes
POV u see my comment and u decide to like it
Why does he have 2 living rooms
I think some of us can agree that James’s house is the house that everyone wants. it’s not to modern or to vintage it’s in between and it may be big but ✨ I still want it ✨
best house tour of 2020 goes to JAMES 😍
Wow! this is like my dream modern/rustic house. not too modern but not too old fashion and rustic. so asthetically pleasing!!!
you real mean for not showing that basement and backyard sis but I am here for it.
"Only one person who likes this will a  one day be a billionaire" "Good luck"

Idk which is worse, the way the video ended or the comment section.
I love it! I like how the main floor is very similar to his last house with where everything is, but also new and fresh and so naturally bright! Havent seen upstairs or the basement yet, but im keen to see it!
his bathroom is bigger than my bedroom ..
This house is a pipe dream for 40 year old married couples and then there’s James😂
💖 Well done!!! 🥳
Okay I don’t get the “whoever likes this first comes a millionaire good luck” or smth like that?? Like did someone spam comment it and everyone is quoting it now? Like what’s goin on-
If my house doesn’t look like this I don’t want it
Only person who likes this will become a billionaire one day" "goodluck"  Can yall like beggars just don't ❤

His house gives me Scandinavian vibes

i’m so proud of you, you’re only 21 and have an entire home😚 you’ve grown so much
Ugh people are so annoying with these “one person who likes this” comments 🤦🏽‍♀️🙄. Just wanna get likes can ya pls stop . The whole cm section is full of nonsense .
Me at restaurant: I’m 2 hour late me screaming  My mom: shut up where at a resturAnte
WoW
Your home is lovely James, I love the wood detail
Ahhh, the “hey sisters”
Y the heck is Friday so far away
Wow 100,000 dollars 💵 😳 umm that is a lot but I will dream of winning it if I don't then its ok because their are a lot of people who want/need the prize and I need it I am in a pickle right now but you know you do you want and love you James, see you later sister 😘
DID HE JUST SAY $100 THOUUUUSAND AND LEFT????
Honestly if I won that money it would be a blessing since my fiancé and I wreck we can’t get a new vehicle 🚗 to go home and he works 6 hours from our home and insurance is being very difficult and things are just not going good for us... police found us not at fault and we still can’t get a good settlement
Omg sis ur such a queen ur my biggest idol and ye ur just beuatfiul I love ur style and the house looks amazing as well kween 😳

"Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionare." "Good luck"
wow it feels like just yesterday i remember james posting his apartment tour
James Charles is a beast when it comes to organizating and choices for a house. His house looks top and cozy. Also the skills by playing the piano in the beginning has me shock. James is such a great and warm yet sweet person and with amazing personality. I love u JC❤
😳
Can I have your house? Pleeeeeease it’s not fair 😰😭
The secret emoji is🏡 am I’m right
I love how his stuff is not displayed to 'show off' his wealth. It kinda tells his personality. Im glad hes doing well!
the fact the his bathroom is my whole house
20, you 21 million subscribers. Love you James
JAMES START TWITCH STREAMING AGAIN, GAMES WITH JAMES WAS SO FUN
Omfg t I love you so f much that I would give you every single thing in my closet just for you to say hi
Can I say it !! "MY HOUSE DREAM" JAMES YOU STOLE IT!!!<3
I’m so happy for you sister
james shows us the house tour  me: wait i wanna see the rest , nooo dont leave me in suspense james ..Friday is so farr away  lol
his closet- 😍
A hole new dream house concept! Amazing 🥰😱😍
Wait didnt Mr kate do some rooms in his house ! And so far his has not mentioned them???!!!
Weber it your rich lol
House is bigger than my future
OMG 😱 your house is literally the one I see in my dreams
Closet? No. That's a whole kingdom of clothing
james i cant wait till friday
“Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire” “good luck”
Head quarters 😳
I thought the giveaway was a smaller house
That's Goals right there, dont ever tell yourself you CANT do something.  Find your passion and figure out how to make a living doing it and you will succeed.  It takes lots of work but you CAN do it!
your house is honestly stunning!
i want games with james back 🥺🥺❤️
literally chokes on my drink when he said giving away 100,000 dollars. That would change my kids, my husband, and my life. I don’t think I’ll get that lucky though
One of my favourite things is the fact that the home is actually liveable!! A lot of home tours that big YouTubers do these days show off homes that are like museums and you wouldn’t wanna move or touch anything in there 😂
Imagine winning $100,000... That money would help me in so many different ways. It’s going to be a blessing to whoever wins. James your home is insanely beautiful!! I love it so much. 💓💓💓💓
Whoa Sister James 100,000 dollars is alot of mulala! I want a house like yours so bad😭
Ummm... looking for a roommate?
James we're 21Million sisters
Omggggggg 😳😱 100 000 $ 😭 I would pay for my dream school (nyfa) because I can’t afford it 😟
Such a dream home! So beautiful James!
So proud of you
I WANT 100k KAKDKWMSZ
Wait I'm confused. He bought a new house. After he made a house tour last year did he tell us this
....yall can someone catch the chicken for me 🐓..............🏃‍♀️
Giiirl who is your interior designer. What a fantastic job!
Wow with 100,000.00 I could get my mom out of that dreadful nursing home and pay people to help me care for her in her final days, instead of her being alone during COVID19
My wife doing big things!
Can afford a house but not a tailor for that blazer
If James didn’t speak so fast this video would be like 46 hours long
*watches this video in broke*
Beyond blessed 🏡🏡🏡🥰😍
oh my omg your new house is nice
James ur not slick, I saw that bottle of crown apple
🏡🏡🏡🏡 you are so sweet and kind you are suck a king in this industry

"Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire" "Good Luck"  0👄0❤️
Wow- Your house is BIG! Bigger than my whole school!! 😂✨

Anyway, eat the rich
chile his house is bigger than my list of insecurities- i didn’t even think that was possible-
Okay but are we going to talk about how short the person was who knocked on the door?
He started from nothing and this is where he is now💖  Say what you want about him but you can't deny he worked hard to get to the place he is now.
Okay but can I just say what a great detail the laundry room being on the 2nd floor with all the bedrooms is? I will never understand why they're always in the basement or the 1st floor when THE LAUNDRY THAT IS BEING MADE IS NOT ON THOSE FLOORS.
this is my biggest dream house ever i seen this! 🥺🥺
OMG!! I literally LOVE his house. ❤️🔥
anyone else think that james room looks like a hotel room
This house is James’s old house but richer lmao

Me: **reading “one person who likes this will become a billionaire”** ugh these comments are so annoying and not true  Also me: **liking it cuz I wanna be a billionaire**
wowowowowowowowowow!
his closet is the size of my room💀
I quite like how the wine cellar is filled with coke bottles instead. the house is lovely. It's very elegant, not sure if that's the right word I'm meaning. It's just very well put together. Think I love the communal living room area. Probably cause the dog was in there too
dream house?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? looks hard to clean tho
Great job you are succeeding in life!😃
my teacher: define *Dream* house Me:

“Only one person who likes this will be a billionaire one day” Good luck !
I don't know why but the closet and certain parts of the house remind me a lot of Colleen Ballinger's house lol
" only one person that likes this will become a billionaire" good luck!
Words can’t even DESCRIBE how proud I am of James🥺❤️
Is this the house Mrkate designed or another one and if it is wut happened to that one
My interior designer ass is so exciteddddd for this video 😍
It's so frustrating watching someone gloat about something they don't even deserve.
it's so.... basic
If I did a house tour it would be 4 mins idk if it would even be that long. 😂
Did like a six year old knock on the door or something?
IM OBSESSED with your new house James! 😍 I see some celebrities/influencers who buy houses that really don’t look homey from the inside and look plain Jane but your house looks welcoming and fabulous!
Sister James.... Congrats!!!

When James’ bathroom is actually bigger than the room you share with your brother 😳

I’m sorry but Coke Cellar had me in tears :)
Ok but like if I win the giveaway ima probably faint or start crying lol

100,000 THATS INSANE - my broke student ass could only IMAGINE
yes you can please do you games
Obsessed.

Me waiting to see the customized “sisters” bench and piano from the Dolan Twins : ..............
Yooo this is a masion💸💸
Your home is beautiful, congratulations James.
🥰🥰🥰🥰
REEE
his entire house is bigger than the local high school, middle school, and elementary school combined....I-
When his bathroom is bigger than your room l-
This was the biggest gotcha joke of 2020!!!
out of all the things in this video why was the only thing i noticed was that the piano in the first room thingy wasn't the sisters piano that he got-
✨Beautiful Home✨
JAMES WHY DID YOU DO THAT I WANTED TO SEE THE REST 🤧🤧
This is a gorgeous house and yes James you will be a fashion guru 😈👏
No jamesssss I wanted to see the sister studio
JAMES cmon you cant do that to us just leave us on a cliff hanger.... But i will say your house. GORGEOUS absolutely stunning!😍😍
Did he just said 100,000 dollars omg
Damn not only 20 mil but 21 that's amazing as hell 🥺💖🔥
“Coke cellar” Hehe
Person: *knocks on James’s door for intro* Me: *slams door and kicks it down demanding for house tour*
I’m so happy to see you added the wood and green colors and not only black. Beautiful house, you worked so hard for it, I’m happy for you ☺️☺️
James can you do a  Video with Finn
Wooooooooooow love love love your style. Home sweet home 🥰 you go sister ♥️
Your house is kind of similar to Rebecca Zamolo‘s house like if you agree😊
I’ve never in my life seen a house with two kitchen islands hahahah
some of y’all hatin on him will NEVER be successful enough to buy a house like this lmao
This is my dream home but not the colors I want green, black, white & brown!!! Especially 200 plants in my house
I love ur house it’s sooo amazing hope I can buy it one day when I am your age 😂 but u really have gone far.
bloxburg houses be like:
Hopefully a fashion career? Nah... James already has one. He's SLAYING right now!!!
Ok but... 100,000$😳 that’s more then what the instant influencers got
When James played Thousand Miles by Vanessa  Carlton I was sister shook😍
My face at the end went from this 😌 to this😮 to this 😲
Beautiful home!!!! Love your positivity ❤️❤️❤️
Hi sister
This is so amazing 🥰🥰🥰 giving me inspiration goals
$100 what 😩😩😩😩😩
how do i get 100k usd? ill try to do anything
This house is so impersonal and boring. Every rich person's house in L.A. looks like this- I'd have no idea this was James Charles' house if I walked inside of it. I can't wait till the fad of white walls and white cabinets and white furniture with black and gold hardware goes out of style. I guess I get it for an AirBnB or hotel but to live there? It would feel so sterile and vacant idk...
Omg James, that house tho is literally my dream house🙌🏼 every single thing about it is BEAUTIFUL!!🥰😍😍
You have an absolutely beautiful home and as a Sister I'm so proud of how far you've come !
James said: AD WHO?????
Id rather live here than the hype house
Out here living my dream with this house 🥺
Me who lives in literally a cupboard:
Oh wow, incredible home James. It's big enough for a whole army haha. Wish you all the best in your new home x
Super minimalist. i love it
OMG! Your house is beautiful! And your house is kinda like Rebecca Zamolo's house!
you can tell how genuinely happy he is to give this house tour ! congrats , it’s such a blessing!! ❤️❤️🎉🎉
James I am so so so happy that you were able to achieve such a thing at your age!! 👏
your dog is so cuteeeeee
He be living the freaking lifeeeeeee
Does anyone know how much this house would be worth? So curious I know we talking millions though
Congrats James Charles!!! You're a BO$$! OMG You're leaving us hanging!!
*when Jame's closet is bigger than your room:*       *I-*
you're at 21 not 20 lol <3
But like, the positive vibe that James irradiates in this video is incredible! It's just so pleasing to see him grow into the mature guy that he is today ♡
Do nicki or beyoncess makeup ( you would FINISH millions of ppls career ) And also can you go back to doing more makeup videos and tutorials not just doing celebrities makeup bc its near back to school time and everything and i feel like your more of a lifestyle channel now NO HATE x
So happy for you James. 28 Million American families are set to default on July Rent/Mortgage payments. The moratorium of evictions have ended and Unemployment Benefits have ran out. Good for you.
Congratulations 🎈❤️
This house is bigger than my aunt’s house, uncle’s house, my grandma’s house and my house 😃😃😃😔😔😔😁🥺😂✨🥺✌🏻💜
YOUR HOUSE IS BEAUTIFUL
Wow james yr house is so beautiful and it looks comfy
when your house is so big you can't even fit it in one video hahah love this for James
minecraft mondays were the best 10000%
It really does hurt to see others living your dreams😩😂
I love this home so much! I was about to be in tears once I saw how beautiful and nice this home was and now I can say this is my only dream home now I'm so happy you showed us this beautiful nicely designed home! And if anyone play roblox I'm building this in bloxburg!  Message for James: you have reached so fair and became one of the most successful people I know! And I'm so happy you reached 20Million You are honestly so blessed and I can say I'm a proud subscriber! Love you James!

Holy moly! This house is insane and I’m sure it is everyone’s dream home! 😋👽
The house is so prettyyyyy, I wish I wasn't a going-to-be-broke college student
The office doors are literally see through and it still infuriated me when he left the doors open when he exited 😭

I love you so much James 😫❤️ I know you won’t notice this but I really really love youuuu
Can we all agree that James house is bigger then our houses?
I don’t know how to explain it, but there is something so likable about James Charles. He just puts me in a good mood
You are just the best James. Everything about you is truly special and you deserve all of the wonderful things this life has to offer. 🥰
It's amazing that you still 21 years old and yet you bought your dream house, I love you so much you deserve all the best ❤️
when james first said “nice and far away for when the parents come” i thought who the hell is james taking to his bedroom he isn’t getting anyone rn and then I realized he just wants space 💔
Hii sistteerr

I love you
Wait until Friday?!?! I can’t wait until Friday!!! I want to see the rest of the video NOOOWWW!!!😭

james in a vid he postes 2 hours ago: 20 million subscriber special!!! james now: has 21.1M subscribers
the house is all cute and its my style but do u even have a toilet in the master bathroom
My emotion matched the 😳 emoji when he said 100,000$
Literally the nicest house ever!!! ❤️
For a guy who spends no time in the closet, he sure has the biggest one I've ever seen😂😂
James: let’s go in the master bathroom Me: bish that’s not a bathroom that’s a bedroom💀😐
stunning house, modern and clean. Love it, James and his team have done a great job x
So proud of you!
Impressive. Beautiful house
proud of you James☺
Omg Jamessss sisssss this tour (this house) is extremely wholesomeeeeeee❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ i admire you soooo much 😭😭❤️❤️
WHAT ABOUT SISTER IANS ROOM!! SISTER IANNNNN
Love it! Stunning like you & you really did that with JoJo. People are fucking haters man.
How you going to clean the house you got to have a maid because that has way too big to clean explain James Charles
That is incredible!
we NEED a james charles and pewdiepie minecraft video felix already said he would do it
Ahahaha his house amazing and beautiful and big
20 million special,, now 21 million 😂
I’m obsessed 😍😍
Let’s see if James can get to being able to do Cardi’s makeup and James I’m so proud of you for becoming the person you are and having as much positivity that you do throughout the world from being LGBTQ to a millionaire maybe soon billionaire or already but your always on your grind always on schedule and always making things eventually work if they can’t so if you see this and like it I would be super happy that’s all I would ask for since my birthday is soon it’s like basically my number one birthday wish
What a way to end the video
James could tell me about his mansion all day long, and it would never come off as bragging
i remember when james first mentioned wanting a house 🥺 so proud of him, been here since the beginning!!!
Can everyone please stop with the ‘like to be a billionaire one day’ comments, it’s repetitive and your just begging for likes🙄
Why is his house what I try to make in the Sims 4 tho
What music does James use in this video? It is fire 🔥🔥🔥
say what you want, but this man is very accomplished
In 2020 I purchased my first pair of jeans!
Games with James
Literally my dream house
why are  you wering a seifti pin for earing its a littlbit weard  [ btw i sister love you  not hate you are the best ]
James for sure has the taste for everything 🧨 If he really making this giveaway for this amount of money that will change someones life from scratch... then... then.. I’m out of words 😂  he’s a role model of public figures. Respect the work he’s doing ! 🙆🏼‍♀️
TELL ME  HOW  EXPENSIVE  WAS YOUR HOUSE HM  Your light switches aren’t even light switches they are so BOUJI
This house is soo nice and the decor also
if i win the money (as i never going to do) I want to pay for a school place at my little brother's dream school:) i hope i win:)

I couldn’t be more happy for you James. You have come literally the LONGEST way but again, so happy for you! 🥺♥️♥️
OMG YOU DID NOT DO THE "TO BE CONTINUED"
James can buy all of his fans x200 then sell us and buy us again. CONFIRMED
Twitter: James Charles ADDICTED to COKE.
This is so stunning wow
omg im obsessed with your house!! also wanted to mention "master bedroom/bath" is a super outdated term that was used in times of slavery :( you can probably use "main bedroom/bath" instead!!
I hope some who gets it deserves it :) good luck you guys!
omgggg I’m early hihihihi
Listen, I’m super impressed (obviously) by how talented and business savvy James is, and I know he probably pays people to clean his house, BUUUUT that house literally doesn’t look lived in at all and it gives me an eerie vibe
I love it omg it’s so cuteeee I love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ hope u had fun in there
Congratulations james im soooo happy for uuu💓💓💓💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️
REINA DE YOUTUBE

TE AMO HERMANA
This house is so perery   I loved
James’ house is literally my whole Pinterest board
I'm pretty sure my apartment is the size of his bedroom and closet, I am hella shook and jelly
I’m really confused🙈 he did a previous house tour in a different house, did he not own that house then since this is his first house?
PLS MAKE A VIDEO WITH EMMA CHAMBERLAIN AGAIN
I'm the only one her from Palestine ??🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Yesssss James’s!!!! 💖💖💖👑
I absolutely love love love your home!!!🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️ Your positive energy you give off turns my bad days to not so bad ♥️♥️♥️
You know, I think it's kind of wrong the way these social media influencers flaunt their wealth. And they wonder why some of them are stalked or robbed etc. Maybe it's not a good idea to let millions of people see your money expressed in the form of an extravagant mansion.
Everyone feeling poor watching this like  👁💧👄💧👁
It looks a bit like Rebecca Zamolos house
beautiful beautiful home! congratulations! so happy and proud of you james. 💕
Just realized he created his YouTube profile on my birthday. 😌❤️
This is so amazing. It's so cool seeing all that you have done  at your age. Love you and congrats!!!
i am so proud of this boy.
His bathroom is bigger than my room lol💀💀
purr
sheesh i wouldn't like to be cleaning all that. very cute tho
Medio Litro
that house is gorgeous
Wow - what a fabulous house! Congratulations James!
we want sister squad back
Where are the living room chairs from?!
Jeffery Star was the first person to dislike this video 💀
Yesssss James’s!!!! 💖💖💖👑
Woah... my bedroom is the size of that master bathroom!
Should I get a earring  (I’m a boy)
pls collab with NICKI MINAJ
Loveeee I’m early! Dose James respond ? Btw love himmmmm !
The first and last comment from me is why did peoples hate the video when the house is absolutly the heaven, i mean it is sooooo beautiful. Is that mean that peoples do not like the house views, that would be crazy if y'all really hate the house.
I love everything 😭!!
The house is simply, beautifully breathtaking <3
Everyone’s saying how his house is to big and honestly I don’t think it is, it’s the seems like the perfect size plus how have y’all seen other YouTubers houses?!
Okay, but why is he rocking Emma's jeans? 👀😂
Batty man fi dead
Wow beautiful
TE AMO HERMANA
The biggest news ever in 2020 is                                                                                        I just wasted your time :)
I love you james 💖 I'm one of your biggest fans 🥺💞 I'm from Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸
So happy for you, cant wait for Friday's video. I wanna see sister headquarters
Geez Why am I feeling fkn broke rn....
When he hit that 'a thousand miles melody' on the piano i was sister shook
I’m acc crying that cliff hanger thooooo
The proudest thing about this video is that the piano that james has is from my dads company soooooo-
James: this is the formal living room  Me: Doggy, Dogo❤️😊🐶🐶🐶
Looks like the same layout as Jenna Marbles house
the fact that this was 2 hours ago and a 20 million special and he got 1 million in that time just amuses me
The house is stunning!!!! It is so you and you can totally tell how much you love it!
Wow.... so inspiring to think he got himself there and not just handed. Congrats
Me with my 60 m² apartment: 🤭
I hate him so much omg why in 2 videos I’m so maddddd
I love his house it’s so Aesthetic! 0:00
Play roblox
The entire time I was thinking how his living room is like the literal size of my house
This is unreal, you should be so proud of yourself!! 🥰
I love how James is posting more raw content rather than everything being so polished. It’s great to see more of his personality coming through in his videos.
3:57 🤭😂 no pun intended
James is literally living in my dream house 😭
"Shore"
I was sure I was the only person alive who dreamed of having a full wall book case with a rolling ladder! Hahahaha well me and Main of course but now it’s me Main and James! 😍
Bitchhhhh u really did that 😭😭😭😍😍😍
This is such a beautiful home!
OMFG!!! Congrats on hitting 21mil. Subscribers! And also, Happy for  Your new house!

Not trying to be bad
in the beginning i thought when he was talking about what the giveaway was he was going to give us his house... 100,000 is good to though

Hi James i love your house it’s so stunning and you deserve it so much 😘🥺✨x
Who is here who just bought like this house in his dream
It looks like his old house, but if you clicked upgrade. The floor plan is kind of similar honestly and the vibe of the house is pretty much the same, accept with a more luxe feel. Love the house. Also I would love to see games with James.
Can you adopt me so I can live with you ? I’ll live in the ‘butlers’ place I’ll cook for you too 😂💕
Cute and all, but I really hope you're actually saving money for retirement sis 👴🏻

THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED: DONT LET HATE STOP YOU. IT ALWAYS PAYS OFF IN THE END.

The whole house looks very serene and veeeeery FORMAL!
ASKJSDFUUEWHFSB JAMESSSSSSSS I CANT TO CLIFF HANGERS

James WTF!!!! 100K$
OMG 100.000 dollars is a lot of money 💸 like really 😅
Hehe by the time his 20 million subscriber special came out, he had 21 million subscribers
"Only person who like this will one day become a billionaire" "Good Luck"

Oh my god I’m in love!!! The way this house has been done is so so good
Your house looks like rebecca zomolo but some areas
I saw a bottle of malibu
Yes do more games because I love to see you playing these games
Anyone else find his house so aesthetic
He really hit us with the to be continued 😂
Something about this house tour feels genuine, yeah it's a big house, but it doesn't feel like he's flaunting his wealth or rubbing it in our faces; he seems genuinely thankful for how far he's come, and he seems like he actually cares about the people who support him. Honestly we have no choice but to stan.
Wowwowwowwow I'm so happy for You. That's dream house. Hope you're going to have the best life there. Eat well and stay healthy James 💞❤
I would love games with James come back btw this time I want to play in the same game and same sever

Omg your house is Beautiful
his house *IS* the orange and teal filter
I love how his house still feels very homely and comfortable, I see a lot of youtubers and influencers buy large mansions and they look so empty and sad, it's refreshing to see a well decorated house that looks very lively

James: “we’re giving away 100,000 dollars” Me: thinking what 100,000 looks like
Stan James for clear skin
He really did that.
1. Yes you should game stream, and it should be Final Fantasy VII Remake. Give it a chance at least through Chapter 10. You don't even know how much that game was MADE for you.   For the best visuals, play on PS4 Pro using an Ultra HDMI cable and QLED so you can max out the visuals.
His closet is literally mall 😍
Lately  I’ve been I’ve been thinking
James charles saying he has a coke seller:😗✌  Mafia bosses:👁👄👁

Half of the time i don't understand what he is saying... I watch it anyway.
Love this video so much your style is amazing
yasss sister!!!! You got your own house :O Yay James Well done Bai sister ^^
I can’t stop thinking about the fact he’s literally neighbors with Logan Paul lmao like

That is the biggest cliffhanger I’ve probably witness in my 26 years of living and I’m lividdddded ugh James! 😤 How could you I’ve been WAITING for your house tour and you pull this!! Ugh but I’ll be here... waiting.. 😣😣
For a guy, you make a pretty girl. I think you should have jogged in place while showing because you talked so fast.
James has grown so much! He saved up his money and grew even bigger!!!
I wonder if he could talk if his hands were tied behind his back☠️
I literally wonder how expensive this house is 🤔
James said house tour but make it 🌟DRAMATIC🌟
was anyone else wondering where the sisters piano was located 💀💀
I AM SO FUCKING HAPPY FOR YOU JAMES! I MEAN U DESERVE THIS! EVEN MORE THAN THIS! YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE BEST PART IN YOU !? IT'S THE FACT THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU FALL DOWN NOW MATTER HOW MUCH PEOPLE TRY TO PULL YOU DOWN... YOU NEVER GIVE A FUCK ABOUT IT! THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT! & MOREOVER YOU ARE A REALLY INNOCENT SOUL! AHHH I JUST LOVE YOU!!!! 💜🧡💛💚💙❤    BTW IT'S 21M SUBSCRIBER'S 😉 IT'S A REALLY LONG TO GO SISTER!
lol love the just started watching
Everyone thinks that James Charles fans are ALL Americans, like this if you're not American.
Now we see a real billionaire coming anytime soon

I- I got a condom ad right as James walked into his bedroom...
Wait I'm confused, I though you moved. It looks so similar to your other house tour.
I sister love his house
So... when am I gonna be invited to be your house pianist?
How did u get 1 mil subs in 1 hour u crazy.....  Btw he posted this an hour ago and now he has 21 million subs
The fact that James has really pulled himself and got him where he is now even after all that mess that happened last year. I'm very proud of him and can't wait for what else he has to bring in the future. Also glad we're seeing more of his personality and more than just his makeup even tho that's obv what he is known for.
JAMES YESSS🤩🤩🤩

my house tour would literally take 3 minutes to film
No matter how much people hate James he Gets past that and  love that he does not let people shame him and let words bring him down.
What a beautiful open home!  All the natural light in the house is amazing.  I hope that it's in an area where fans can't easily come and knock on your door.  When that happened at the other house that was scary.  It happens to David D all the time too.  Stay sister safe.

Wow impressive. I always dreamed of a house as well. It has been always my biggest dream. You accomplished so much at such a young age already. Take care and enjoy your new house x
Holy s*** your house is gorgeous!!😭 you’ve come so far and you’re only gonna keep going up in life I love you tons!🥰
He is 21 million not 20 m congrats sisters and james 💅🥳🥳🥳
OMG!!! JAMES IM SO PROUD OF YOU ALL ALL THAT YOU HAVE ACOMPLISHED! LOVE YOU <3
People need to realize how impressive this is, he’s 21!! And he bought a full on HOUSE! That’s amazing ♡
He’s 21 and made it this far and everything he’s gone through he still is going strong and didn’t give up. Just to see him grown into his own person and just happy with what he is doing in his life. Keep your head up and love yourself and don’t let anyone tell you different. 💕
I like how james is making more “vlog” videos they are very fun to watch
Snaps to James for one being so successful at 21 to buy the gorgeous house, and two for being so light hearted and humble about it
that house is on pointttt !! kinda seems like a family house but still love it
i couldn’t keep a single room clean, and james can keep his entire house looking ~*aEsThEtIc*~
i could get lost in that house fr
You should get Architectural Digest to do a video on your home!!!
Sister sneaky!!

Ok this is one of the most gorgeous houses I’ve seen. It’s so modern and chic without being to futuristic, the color palette is so calming and clean, the use of space is perfect, I’m 1000% saving this video for house inspo in the future. It’s my biggest dream to have a place like this where I can just be creative with friends and have my own little escape every day. Also... $100,000 😱👀
beautiful!

The Yamaha piano stresses me out

How long did this take to renovate!! It’s amazing
Did Remi Cruz buy jame’s old house?
This sister house 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations, what an amazing moment for you this is. I hope you enjoy every moment. Xx
James filled his wine cellar with coca cola bottles.... SIS, THIS IS WHY WE LOVE YOU. 😘😍
James, you're wrong for ending the video so quickly mannn...I didn't even realize 17mins had gone by!
Your house is STUNNING So proud of you and everything you've accomplished ❤
James, did you film this video back when you had 20 million subscribers?   PS. stan this house for clear skin
The actual amount of goals this is omg
😂😂😂 he broke the ladder
WOW 😍❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎
i-
omg this is litterally. a eye opening house 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Wait there is more to the house....
My nephew is in his walker and heard you say "we're giving away $100,000 dollars." So he turns with a suspense look on his face. I laughed so hard.😍❤ Perfect timing for everything.🙏
YOU CALL THAT A HOUSE THATS A NEIGHBORHOOD💀
Can you be live tomorrow
You have a mic 4:17 can you try doing asmr pls
Actual dream home 😍
James Charles *buys a house*  Also James Charles: doesn’t use any of the rooms in the house 😂
If think James decor is so pretty👇
Omg I would want that money😂
finn is living the life
i love that his house theme is a mix of modern and country
I would love to just walk in there because this is what you would see on Pinterest . Also its simple but SO CUTE
I haven't seen any bots in the comments yet-
its the being 21!!! & the mansion!! & it being paid in full FOR ME!! i cannot comprehend
OMG did James really have to do a to be continued moment RN! No no no I need to see that room right now. I need to see the back yard. I need to see the beauty of it all. How could you show us all this and say to be continued. On that note, I love the coloration and decor! It fits so well. I wish I had half as much taste as James!
I was sister shocked when he mentioned the amount he was giving away. Such a saint! 💖💖
I love James
Me: trying to scrape by some money to maybe be able to afford a tiny apartment in a few years James Charles: buys a huge mansion as his first house Me: wondering where my life went wrong🤔😅
hi sister lysm
Can i get the 100 dollars, I've subscribed to u since 2016 and followed u since forever.............My family can't get much and i want to start my own youtube to support my family&friends as well
You must change your title into 2021 not 2020. 2020 is suck!😠🤮. I hate 2020 worst year ever in my entire life 😭😭😭😭   I miss 2019
Oh my goddddd I can’t waitt
Would anyone else watch a hide and seek vid w James and his friends in his house? Might just be me but I think it would be funny asf

“OnLy PeRsOn WhO lIkEs ThIs WiLl OnE dAy Be A bILlIoNaIrE” “gOoD lUcK”

When his bathroom is bigger than ur bedroom---
James bathroom is the same size as my room-👁👄👁 I don't even have a bathroom but I have a pc and like a closet but I put beanbags in dereeereree hehe
Prettyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy house      Amazing sisters
I'm in the process of buying my first house at the age of 26, this is lovely but I can't imagine having this much space - if I put my phone down in my flat I'll lose it for a good 20 minutes. If I left it somewhere in this house it would be probably lost into the abyss forever 🥴😂
Bruh what was he living in before? A box? 😳
Me being a British sister and wondering if the give-away is just for American sisters? 💛 Love the new house btw ☺️✨
Honestly I just want games with james back, I really dont care about anything else
Your bathroom is half the  size of my bedroom lol
WHAT!!!!!!!!!!! I can’t wait!!!!!
His closet is the size of my room
coke seller 😼
dudeeeee so proud of u, u be as legit icon <3
Goals 😭
when you live in a trailer park so this all looks so gorgeous to you😭
"Coke cellar" did not come across the way James though there...
Why is there so many “only person who likes this comment will be a millionaire. Good luck.” Sooooo annoyingggg
Such a beautiful house, excited to see the rest. You’ve worked hard for this james!
100k what????

Random, I think his house looks alotnlike rebecca zamolo's house. But bigger. Seems like it and different design like the basement.
Wow the interior design is so beautiful! The entire home is so beautiful
I’m sorry, but that one Coca Cola bottle with the label facing the wrong way is making me go crazy... plz
I have to build this in the sims. my babies about to be boujee asf
Was anyone else checking his foundation color the whole time?

I’m living for these tones. James has done it again! Love him and everything he stands for. Very deserving of this and so much more! 💕✨
Ok, James’s house is defiantly my favorite YouTube’s house mostly because of the aesthetics

If i see one more comment saying: “Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire good Luck”  ima flip, like bruh shut up unless you plan on giving me a billion dollars.

This shit is so beautiful 😍
It's the fact that James' bathroom is bigger than my bedroom for me
You inspire us❤️
You should have a gaming channel Called Games With James

His bedroom is my house lol
me wanting 100k dollars
"welcome to the new 2020 house tour"....meaning he'll have a new mansion by 2021..... ?

what 100k thats how much i make in a life
yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
6:01 so ur not subbed to safiya 🥴
We don’t need to see you show off how rich you are. Most of the country is poor and struggling and works their ass off
K now James be careful of Peaches now! She be already lurking lmao 😆
omg
Omg the living room looks sooooooo comfyyyyyy😍😍😍
James: so the vibe in this room is, cool and beachy vibes.  Me: No sister your whole house is classic YouTuber vibes
Idk but i wanna spend christmas at your house
No u didn't just not show us the studio come on we have nothing to do at home and now we have to wait more 😭😭 I'm so curious  It's so nice of James to show us his private place that only means how much he grew up and how simple he is  I love the outdoor space he has beside the master bedroom I'm in love
omg
Me knowing I’m never getting a chance for any give always 😔
This called me poor in 43790635 languages.
My life would be completely changed with this money. I want it so badly! I have really had to fight and work and scrounge for everything I have and still I live paycheck to paycheck in a tiny apartment and my car no longer runs and I can’t afford to get a new one. I know I most likely won’t win this money but I’m grateful that you guys are generous enough to give to someone bc it really can change someone’s life for the better. Thank you so much James and his team for always remembering the people who got you to where you are and being so kind!! 💕💕💕
its a barbie dreamhouse
No i deleted my comment that had 2 likes :(
"Only person who likes this will one day become a billionaire" "Good Luck"
“only person who likes this will one day become a billionaire” “good luck”

James Charles is like the nicest person ever I don’t know why he gets so much hate
that literally looks like colleen ballingers  closet
To the random person who likes this will be famous one day :)
I can’t believe James Charles is buying that nice cool and expensive house but I’m sure it’s not that expensive
Your closet is bigger then my room
This video image me feel ✨p o o r✨
Am I the only one upset he didn't show us his entire house?😂💖
SHEESH that's a lot of money
My face on the end be like: 🤨 -> 😳😳
Idk why, but all this video did was make me tired hahaha
Am I the only one who thinks this house looks so similar to the other?!  The same placement of the rooms (formal living room, formal dinning, kitchen with the little space for the pantry, the stairway, the doors to the rooms upstairs, the glass winery/Coca Cola). I'm so confused. 😅 It's beautiful though!
i love that his closet is the same size if my room
Your house is so stylish and modern and so freaking cool. I'm so glad to see that after all the hard work you've done and all the ups and downs it finally pays off. Well done sister James,well done
God has really blessed you 😘😍
James I am your biggest fan i watched every single video and i love you so much I am watching about 3 years you are my fav youtuber❤
My house tour would take 3 minutes maybe less the living room, one bed room....well yea hoped you enjoyed-
at first i thought he was giving away his house lol
Our boy has grown up🥺
*When a dog is more lucky than YOU.*
The house is awesome

His house is such a vibeee
😳
I’m really happy that you have a place to call home. Looks cozy. Good job renovating and furnishing this house! Love it!

James bathroom makes me feel ✨single✨
James Charles: *has a huge house* Me: *I dont even have a upstairs and downstairs house* But I like the house
I have the longest ad ever going right now
Is anyone gonna talk about how the master bathroom is the size of my living room 👀👀
This must took forever to Edit!!💖💗 and james I want your  Lavender sisters hoodie but its kinda expensive. Or idk lol I really want it

Can I love hear like PLEASE JAMES I BEG YOU
He loves white colour so much . And good home .
Can he like give me his house?
I love how James is always mentioning how much time he spends with friends and family , he is so humble and knows what it is important,  which is friends and family❤
Wait no no no sister you can't leave me hanging like that no no no please realise the vedio I'm so curious ugh 💖💖
Pls play ROBLOX adopt me and be my friend on ROBLOX I will tell u my user if u reply
One day 💕 you give me hope x
it’s the coca cola wine cellar for me
chile his bathroom is LITERALLY bigger than my room i-
The house is beautiful but i feel it is lacking color and personal touches. Everything is neutral toned, I just thought it was a little boring. That’s probably just my taste though, I guess i’m not a huge fan of the modern interior design style. I’d just rather have my bedroom filled with pictures of me and my friends, books, and posters of movies and things that make me happy. I guess some people would rather sacrifice a personalized room for one that is more aesthetically pleasing. But this is Jame’s house, not mine and i’m glad he loves it! ❤️
I REALLY HOPE HE SEES THIS BUT CAN YOU MAKE VIDEO OF YOU PLAYING ROBLOX?!! LIKE I THINK ITS GONNA BE SUCH A FUN VIDEO TO FILM AND ALSO A FUN VIDEO FOR YOUR VIEWERS TO WATCH💗💗
Omg only that James bought this house only on the age of 21 years old shows how talented and intelligent James is some people could only dream this house at their old 50s Love u James
James is sister drowning in the jacket😂😂
Danm the master bedroom is like triple tke size of my bedroom
James u are rich rich 👁👄👁
I’m taking notes. 😍
Omg I love your new house James it’s amazing
we need more games with james
Half of the house is decorating
that dog must be so lucky
I wonder how much tiding he did 😂
Omg that is a lot of money and that would help so much seems my mom is moving to a new job hope I win good luck everyone 😮😮😮😮🥴
You should’ve did a giveaway to buy one of your subscribers first ever house
anyone know what company the chairs at 6:55 are from??
your house looks boring as hell tbh like wtf put some art, color in it

Heads up, but did you know Coca Cola is the biggest (plastic) polluter of the ENTIRE world! They got the award 2 years in a row and since then I just stopped buying anything from them or their huge variation of brands linked to them. Save the planet!! 🌏

So awesome ... Wishing u the best 🙏 you got this
Congratulations! You deserve it. Remember, whoever is reading this, with hard work and dedications, dreams come true, and James Charles is proof about what I just said. GET UP and chase your dreams. Not tomorrow, not in a week, NOW. You probably keep saying "tomorrow I will do it", You will probably say that everyday and then never start. Remember, you can't finish something without starting it. Chase your dreams now!
James is so kind and humble I love your new home it is so pretty it would be my dream if I I could be in a video ☺️😝and I am really exited to see your bottom floor 😆😌🙃

5:59 the fact that me and James have the same water dispenser makes me feel special idk why tho oop
When his house looks more comfortable than your own bed
Games with James!! We would love to see it, maybe you could start streaming on twitch again, or even start a full on series. Minecraft SMP with friends, MC Championships, possibly minecraft monday??, among us/fall guys with friends, or lets play series like: Detroit Become Human, Beyond two souls, etc. We would love to see you game and chill with other players again.

I like how James hasn’t bought a fancy huge house so just he could brag about it but I love how his whole house is organised with stuff and is not empty unlike other youtubers. It’s just really tells that how organised he is and not leaving random spaces empty
It is so pretty
I will cry😢

Danggg what the freak I love the Black Mable 😍😍
Yaaas
Is it just me or did you also think she was giving away his house
James looks so much like DUA LIPA 2:23 im confused
eat the rich
He bought a house that was probably made for a somewhat rich family-
I remember watching you last year, and when I looked at what u accomplished. My first thought was I need to start YouTube. I asked my mom if I could get the stuff I needed and she said "no we don't have the room, or the money". So I thought what can I do to get money. I figured the easiest way was to get a job, so I got a job. When I finally had enough money to buy half of the stuff I needed. My mom told me we still don't have the room. (My mom is in her 30s and we live in a apartment). After she told me we don't have the room, I gave up. When I was younger I didn't live with my mom. My brothers and I all lived at a boarding school that had a whole bunch of houses on the campus. I lived there for 10 years of my life. (I don't know if I can say the name of the place, but it's in the midwest). My mom is still trying to buy a house, but i don't know if she will ever get there. You have worked so hard for a house, and you have accomplished so much. Congratulations on buying a house.
100,000 dollars?!?!?!?? OMG that's my dream is to have enough money to be able to build a house ans I know some people would be like " omg she doesn't need it " or something like that. Even if I don't get the money I wish the person that does will happily enjoy the money and have fun!!!!!!!!! Honestly James you crack me up, you SOOOOO beyond talented and so caring <3
I subscribed! And I want to participate for the giveaway!
mom: honey wat are your future plans  me: well..ooh yeah can i borrow 5bucks

The furniture in what James calls the “landing area”(the chair and bookshelf by the stairs) probably costed more than my whole house

Can people in the comments actual talk about the beautiful mansion
dazzling home I love seeing James happy af love you Sister 💞😍😘😇.
I am soooo happy for you. You finally bought your first house and it loooks sooo beautiful. James, you are a hardworking, thoughtful, considerate man and each and every one of your sisters/ babes could not be more proud of you. I hope more and more blessings will come your way in the future by our Lord God in the Heaven above. Love you and wish you nothing but happiness ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
his bathroom is bigger than my bedroom-
If I was in Alabama and I saw James of course I would look because he stands out not in a bad way. If I saw him in LA I would think nothing of it . In all true  honest if I was scrolling on instagram I would think that it was a pretty famous person. The people that criticize him are people sitting around upset about them self that they are not as gorgeous that he is. The people put these to people together famous and non famous they should treat them the same
Please bring back the gaming!!!
At first the door was gray black, but when he shut it, it was light brown?, I'm confusion
Am I the only one waiting for him to say “Hai BrOtHeRs” ?!
💞💞
Video idea: find a makeup look you want to re-create and re-create it in however long you need and then again in 30 minutes and finally in only ONE minute!   Are you up for the sister challenge ?
OMG 😱 Beautiful you deserve it All❤️ I would pay for my daughter collage if I won the 100,000😁❤️
wait wasnt there supposed to be a giveaway????
James you look beautiful I mean bootifull 😍😍
He should play fnaf
congratulations sister ! 💘💘

You should do a 24 hour challenge in your closet
Can you like... gift me the house? Or at least a small part of the house? Please 🥺
Love your videos James
me thinking the giveaways the house:👁👄👁
I’m sad that I can’t be in the giveaway because I don’t have Instagram😒😞😔🥺😕😟🙁☹️😣😖😫😩😢😭😤😠😡🤯 but I do follow James Charles and I wish I was in the giveaway
NOOOOO WHY DID THE VIDEO HAVE TO ENDDDDDDDD
This is the best YouTuber house tour I have ever seen! James, you nailed it sister!!!
Wow i'm speachless
I WAS WONDERING WHY THE VIDEO WAS SO SHORT UGH
6:55 finn 🥺🥺
not him plugging his pantry organiser but not mr kate that decorated it all to begin with
it's genuinely so impressive that a 21-year-old bought this house.
when he mentioned a give away why did i think he was talking about the house-
Me thinking about being 21 still living with my mom and also going to collage and yet never making as much money as James?!
This house is so freakin beautiful ❤️❤️ I love it😊❤️
If I had the 100,000 dollars I would buy all his merch to give him money -3$
You from a year ago probably couldn't even imagine. You must be so (rightfully)  proud 🥰
that plot twist is pure evil.
One day. ONE DAY. I will literally be this famous and live in a house like this. Dream Big 🍸♥️
You have copied the ACE family homeeee
Your house is like rebecca zamolos house
love your house SO much
Wow.
When James's bathroom is bigger than your room🥺
I love that he is such a minimalist!! I'm obsessed! So clean, so tidy so sisterly! Also, yes please be a fashion guru I always see your outfits on instagram and you're always looking so good! Love you sister♡♡  Please sister shout out my comment
Hi James

I litterally thought the give away would be an Iphone 😳
Honestly my mum would live that kitchen
I hate that people hate you for no reason,your actually nice and you don't hurt people's feelings on purpose.
i’m sorry did i hear that right? 100,000 DOLLARS?!!!!!
The decore is just perfect *👨‍🍳 💋 *
dammmm james $100,000! That is too much, I give up 😞😞😭

Idk why but I'm addicted to saying sisters! Ughh! No hate!
Wow James!! 100K?! That’s so much! Thank you so much for picking someone to win that much. I was wondering how you join the giveaway because that money would really help my mother get a house. We live in a small cramped apartment with 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms a small kitchen and living room. I have to share a a room with my old sister which is kind of hard considering we have different styles and she is very messy. Once again I thank you for doing this giveaway I hope I could win.  Good luck to everyone! (Someone please tell me how to enter, also I’ve been subscribed for a while but this is a new account since the other ones password was forgotten 😅)
That house is amazing!
We want more minecraft with james😂🥰
Success is a blessing ❤️🙏
Hey james
So calm and beautiful... My only concern is that your pictures have museum glass. What is on them now is too reflective to even see the pictures.
You deserve it sister

What took you sooo long sister
That house is so beautiful.
hey James, have you ever thought about getting a personal microphone for videos like this? sometimes the audio was a little hard to hear because of all the echoing and it could be a little hard on the ears. I think a microphone would help the audio stay consistent and clear throughout the video :)
I’m so proud of how far you’ve come sister and looking fabulous while doing it!!
Jamesssss film a morning or night routine in the new house
james literally has been the only one that is having a good year in 2020
I wanted to see the backyard 😭 but I love your house so beautiful
I absolutely love James house and he's inspired me so much to push to do my dream of being an interior designer so thank you so much sister James❤😘
goals!!!!!! <3
This house reminds me so much of your old one
when he posts this to celebrate 20 million but now has 21 million so proud!
This is really a blessing.. I can't congratulate you enough James.    I literally don't have a plate or a cup to my name at 31 years old but I am extremely proud of you.   This is a dream home😍😍
Why’d he do us like that’s 😭😭
you are absolutly my favrouite influncer   i have watched eache and every video of yours and my fav  one is which you uploaded with the kid you are soo humble and kind + soo down to earth person  i love watching you...you are such an inspiration  one day i want to become as successful like you  love from india
He’s so successful at his age. Imagine having a house like this @ 21
I love the vibesss
I want that house:/
James: we are going to tell you the give away at the end of the video* does what he says he's going to do* Also James:u know what sisters gotta be patient bit$$##  Sister I'm sorry but I ain't like that
Omg this house is huge!!😱
I'm literally in love with his house
😳 oh wow! 😳
Nooo... i wanted to see the whole house😭
But I would like to enter your giveaway. If I won that would mean so much and I would give the money to my parents. We really need the money because we really need to move houses. Our house is old and I still share a room with my sister and she doesn’t like it. So it would mean so much to win the giveaway
do some more cooking videos
I screamed so loud when it said “To be continued...” JAMES why!

James: "This room is the furthest from my room... nice and far away"   Me: BAHAHAHAHA
Hi James! So I would dm you but I can’t have Instagram
Congrats James, your house is really beautiful 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
James: we do do a lot of snacking   Me: AHA YOU SAID DODO
james in every area: we have this gorgeous, gorgeous _____
Me: remembering ur friends complained about how little chairs you had in ur old house  Also me: *being satisfied by seeing you finally have chairs by your counter table*
Lol my entire apartment that houses four people could fit inside his bedroom
The ending is so confusing
Damn

Name: Karen Taylor Age: 23 $20,000?  Good day! James and James Team who are currently reviewing names for potential candidacy! My aspiration for the $20k is to use it wisely!   • YOUTUBE CAREER! Yes! I WANT TO BE A YOUTUBER!  •Equipment (its expensive so I will purchase whats priority right now) •Lighting, camera, lense and more! I want to invest this money career wise!   I have been working and saving up my coins. Little by little I have been purchasing for my set up! I think viseo production is very important and so I  want to also invest the money to better my YouTube graphic designs, animations like I want to be the best version of myself and help others feel beautiful through my videos!   I want to give back just how you are doing! Please invest in me!
James, you should play hide & seek with your friends and team members in your new house. The winner gets a prize and the “loser” has to do something of your choice! ⬇️ People who agree!
Me out here like you pay people to comment on your instagram you don’t need to do any more giveaways
I was literally just watching your til tok 😂 I’m a new sister
OMG
this is by far the nicest house I've ever seen.  It's the perfect balance of everything.. not too much and not too little.  The celebrity homes I've seen on architectural digest are not as impressive.    This is my dream home.. congratulations Jamsey.  God is good
this is how many times he said formal 👇
i could really use the money. i wanna help my mom get away from her abusive husband but we can’t pay the divorce papers cuz we’re in depth
my sister is the same age as james and she has no job has a house that looks like ass but most of the time just stay at are parents house
I like the beach colors in your home.

You deserve this, you’ve worked so hard for everything you’ve gotten and didn’t let all of the hate get to you. Good job💗
WHATTT!!!
It's beautiful James! Can't wait to see the rest! 😍😍
James is the CEO of hey sisters

James is my inspiration! this is the best house I've seen all of 2020!
that 100k would save my 2020 and my life entirely ! 😭 <3
Literally a DREAM home!!! You go sister! 👏🏼 Can I move in?! 😭😍🙌🏼
This video just called me out in poor in 64 different languages
All of these “Good Luck” comments, how about, after watching this house tour, get off your ass and make your dreams happen! I’ve been in a rut, and there have been periods where I’m like “I want that” or “I can barely...”-NO, stop. If I can make the life I want happen so can anyone else.  Forget luck, because we all have the energetic power to manifest what we want. Yes, the process is long, but we can do it, yes we sure as hell can.
i Don't know why but I kind of feel like James is very happy in his life this year
UH i know sister james did not leave me with the To be Continued -_- PaInNnNnNnN
Gosh I love his house!!! It’s so pleasing and just so pretty.
Hi
James: buying his own house Me: still studying and without money lol
Your the best jaaames i love your makeup

If you’re reading this, may god bless you and your family. May god protect all of us for facing everything that’s happening in the world!
oh my word. 100,000 dollars would pay for mine and my brothers college, and even pay off my parents student loan debt.  That is an insane amount of money!

This is how many times James said fOrMaL
Add: buy asda for a 1% voucher  James: HeY SiSTERs
But his kitchen is literally as big as my house...      I make videos!!  Have a great day xx
Having a “coke” cellar is actually hilarious
It looks like those houses you see in magazines...i love it but the master bathroom and bedroom are way too big they look kinda empty but thats my opinion
when it said to be continued i almost threw my phone.... wtf james?
Lol whenever someone knocks/opens a door my dog barks so at 0:17 my dog wouldn’t stop barking for like 5 minutes 😂
This is such an amazing flex, I've always been inspired by you, James. $100,000 would be so life changing to anyone. My family is really struggling to make it during these hard times. Being able to buy us all a home to share would be such a blessing. Thank you for all you do James.

Hey James I looked at a tiktok about you and I was sad when I found out but I didn’t wanna believe it please tell me if this is true, have you ever went up to a 6 year old kid and put makeup on them then when their mother came she ask why you did that and you said her face looked like a train reck, honesty I don’t wanna believe but I know that tiktok isn’t always right so I wanted to ask from you if it was true   (No hate I just wanna know)

What I most love avout James' house is that it looks like a 'normal' house in the colors, layout, and general design. Of course the house is ENORMOUS and has a bunch of this that arent in the typical US home design, but its design layout and color pallette doesnt seem super bougie or flashy which I looove
James.... adopt me 😂

Why the cliffhanger 😥 I am literally crying like actual tears
I have to wait 3 days now 😐😐😐😐
When I was younger I was still trying to find myself and who I wanted to be and watching your videos and looking at your post reminded me of how life is not horrible and everyone has to accept everyone and that’s why I have accepted who I am as a person and my sexuality and I can thank you your videos pushed me out of my comfort zone and I’m grateful bless you, and all your family & friends😄❤️
This house is so sister-stunning, I can't wait to see the rest, Friday can't come soon enough!
I am so happy for you! You deserve it so much! ❤️

James is getting so far in life 🥺💓 I’m proud of him !!
Ok so I’m in my late teens but back then when I was 10-13 this was my house in bloxburg 💀
When u need the money for college but know will not get it: 👁💧👄💧👁
Meanwhile me trying to get a job that pays enough so i could get to rent one room apartment with barely any space at all and survive alone....
Omg
Stunning
I'm so happy that u could bought ur house sister.!❤️
his house is AMAZING. like omg this is like literal pinterest goals 🥺
Good for James, he worked hard for it.  My only concern is teenagers seeing this and assuming they can easily build a highly lucrative career through being an influencer. Like anything else in entertainment, it's a lot of work, timing and luck, very very few make it to being able to afford the swanky homes in LA
Omg I love it
Congratulations 🎊🎉🎂🎂🎂
sis gonna hit 30 mil in a month
Are you gonna film with emma soon?
I love the marble by the fireplace
I know it is not too early but hey,I'm early
House goals

me at 7: i wish i have a really big home  and a very good job  me at 17: i just hope i get a job that pays the rent to my one room apartment
this actually looks like the expensive houses you'd see on pinterest and save them even though you know damn well you'll never be able to afford it
I don't want 100k I just want an iPhone 11 pro to give it as a present to my mom cause her phone is old and mine too but she's spending all her money on me and my sister to pay university fees so I just want to give her something in return but I can't afford it 😭💔
His house looks like an upgraded version of his previous house
I’m here for the “lifestyle” videos! Such a mature sister! 💕  Also, recently saw one of your first videos of you showing us your ROOM...look at you now showing us your HOME!   Motivation that anything is possible when you believe!
imagine living like this
Home goals
100000 eEeeEeEEeE sO mUcH eEeEeEeE
If anyone ever robbed ur house they would have a payday

When james said welcome to sister studio... i literally got goosebumps. I dnt knw abt house but the sneak peak if studio gives me like goals... for a studio. Oh my god.  The house was also supremely grand and i like the use of black tones. Like it was subtle n classy. Completely opposite of what we do here in india. Its totally flashy here
Im sorry but did he just say 100,000 dollars!?!?!?! Like that is literally so selfless and can actually CHANGE someones life.
Has now one noticed that this is rebec zamolos home Xd
why did i get chills on the last two minutes of him saying to be continued, that he is giving away 100k, and him saying come back on friday
Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE IT... Congratulations James truly well deserved.

I hope you keep doing this as long as you are able to and I honestly wish I could be a celebrity just so I could meet you (but I can’t cause I’m 11) I honestly never thought I would see sombody so inspiring get this big you are my biggest inspiration! I watch every video you ever make and they all amaze me and make me smile! Today I saw this and I can’t believe there is a chance I could win something like that if I did I would donate a lot and put some in college savings and some in makeup and the rest probably to help others but I shouldn’t get my hopes up there are thousands of people wanting to win all I ask is that you some how see my comment and yea love you James keep up with the hard work you amaze me every video! 🙂
aaay this is the earliest I've ever been aaaaa

Hi
petition to bring back games with james
this is the type of house i would build in The Sims 4
When James's house is bigger than my house and school and brighter than my future:
James talked about having earthquakes and making sure the mirror was stable then goes to a wine cellar filled with coke that is super unstable and would cause a mess during an earthquake. Contradicting a little bit.   No hate I love James just something I noticed 💜
This just makes me hella proud of how successful you've become.❤️
James OMG your house is Gorgeous. Congratulations on your success. Hard work has paid off greatly. I so wish I had your ambition. Can't wait to see and hear more. The contest is out of this world and will be the most amazing blessing to whom ever Wins.
They are just jealous that he is talented
We get it... you don't know why people hate on James blah blah blah positivity

I don’t know if this is fate or just a coincidence. But literally today my dads truck broke down, and I said what if we won like 100,000. Then a hour later James uploads and says he’s giving away 100,000.
I just love the fact that he’s so beautiful and he still loves the colour white and black
Hiiii
To be honest, he would make an amazing Estate Agent
His bathroom is pretty much the size of my house. I also seen the bags ZHC customized for you.

The house is the cutest thing I ever seen love you james
james really just turned into ru paul for a sec and said “see u friday” like ummm 😯
Stealing ideas for my minecraft house
To prevent getting cold for 10-30 mins, at the end of the shower, turn it to cold, the COLDER the better. This is because your body is naturally colder than u think, if you bathe in water that is around 20 degrees centigrade (don’t know what it is in Fahrenheit) you would probably burn yourself and it also wakes you up more
literally his old house but fancier
This is literally the best house tour I've seen
Sister, you deserve it! So proud & happy for you!
wow that’s one nice house 😳
the fact that he's only 21 😳. i aspire to be like james in the future

I love how relaxing your home is. All that nature lighting is amazing.
You should do a season of videos where you teach basic makeup steps for people who are new to makeup! Because you don’t do many basic looks, it would be nice to do a little season of just learning basic stuff, especially since your so popular!

Everything you do is just so hard working and it definitely shows on your videos. One thing that might be weird but my parents didn’t want me to buy your merch witch I was so upset about but just seeing your videos it makes me already happy. Keep up the great work
Love you James 💜💚💙

The layout of the downstairs is so similar to the last 🤔
I’m new here loved your house 👌❤️
This is how many people thing james is the most pure person ever🥺🖤
Why do big houses always have an absurd amount of storage space for wine? I'd much rather have an empty room and if I wanna add wine racks, I can...instead of having a whole room for wine when you don't even drink.
I thought the candle on the kitchen  counter was a lil birthday cake 😂
Congrats on the beautiful home!!!
Omg my dream house
The brand's name in the advertising before the video was "Sure"😂 James: Shore
been waiting so long for this !!
HI King of Makeup
I LOVE the house it's so beautiful, stylish, and perfect for you James! Also, I would love to see Games with James come back!!! <3
Chames Charles does not deserve this hate he is soooo cool

James: look at my new beautiful house which costs millions. Me chilling in my pourly designed house built in the 1950's: my house could never. Anyways he deserves this cause he worked hard for it. Good job James.   But two islands... I only have two counters 😭

You should do a before & after video of your home!!! I would love to see what it looked like before you renovated it!!💛💛
Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

6:54 favorite shot
James you have inspired me so much. We are the same age and your so bloody successful! I’m currently in bed and booked some annual leave from work as life is becoming too stressful. I work 5, 12 hour night shifts in a care home and start my nursing degree next month and head off to University. I love caring for people with Dementia, as it’s my way of giving back to the community and my Great Nanna Doreen was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2013 and they did such an amazing job of looking after her and loving her when I was unable too. So now I have the opportunity to do the same. However my heart is in make up, I love picking up a brush and forgetting about the world and being in my own bubble. You’ve literally made me realise, whilst watching this and I’m laying here in bed, that if you can do it... I CAN do it! So inspiring and I hope one day I can have the same talent and drive as you do... honestly so happy for you sister, keep on shining you absolute star! Love you 🥰
COOL HOME BRO
Wow.. What a beautiful home. 😊
Your house is beautifulllllll! Hell yeah James!
james is so nice and sweet idk why people hate on him and i love his house

Yes sister so beautiful 😍💕💕
I love how James is always so genuine and kind in his videos💕 his personality shines through and he doesn’t let the hate get to him...STAY STRONG SISTER!💓      I’m a small youtuber xx
His bathroom is like our whole house i-
His kitchen I bigger than my entire house and basement put together
ur restroom is the size of my bedroom and living room i- shorreeeeeee
BROOOOO I just thought of this what if James picked a random sister and he would do their makeup! that would be so cool!!!!!!! There could be some sort of competition or something to pick or he could just pick randomly.
If anyone deserved this house it's sister James. He's been through so much in his career and I can't think of anyone else who deserves this more than James
GAMES WITH GAMES!  yes
Congrats James!🥰 You deserve the best!!!🥳
I love your new house it looks great James
James literally minds his business. He doesn’t deserve the hate
I like the new stuff but it looks the same

You should consider collecting special edition coke bottles or cokes from around the world in your cellar!
Gotta fix that squeaky door sister
Hey guys
You need to change where you put your birken because it doesn't have stuffing in their it's gonna lose it shape
I love you james! Your video always make my day❤
I have been waiting for this for soooooooooo long!!! ❤️
Right he is so kind
God Im dying for your new home 😣🥰❤️
Can I stay in the coke cellar.  I have 5 dollars
i’m literally watching both of the house tours at the same time so i can compare them 💀
Wow 😍😍
Why did I read the title like "bought my first house tour"
james called me unsuccessful in 43 different languages
can i move in?
Crazy. 100k that could be a down payment to a house. I would cry
so u r telling me one person needs this whole thing
What are the odds of me winning the giveaway!‼️⁉️
That is literally the same house as Rebecca’s who agree’s
We love the professional sister outfit

i‘m genuinely happy for u u deserve it👍
Only real sisters have been waiting FOREVER for this video😂
I saw this on James’ snap you know I was sister shook
Ok thank you for making me feel bad again
O M G 😱 😱 😱
25mins late new goal yay 💖💖
ok nice house but lacking colour and character . its just bland , so cheap painting whole house with white emullsion paint from aldi ..  the bedroom is sooooooo boring , only decent room was the bathroom ,,,,,,,, james please put some character give it a room   dedicated to the sisters with colour and sparkley stones , i feel like this is his parents house , and too much shoulder pad in ya jacket  you losing ya style , if  you took me in the house and guessed who owned it i would say hilary clinton ... trump has more style ,, seriously james va va voom the decor
I'm ✨in love ✨ with the kitchen
james! you are a sweetheart♥️🥰
He said mookbongs😂😂
OMFG, I WAS JUST WATCHING HIS APARTMENT TOUR😭 AND LOOK AT HIM NOW😭❤️
Literally preach sisterrrr. He deserves to show this off, cause he worked his ass off. More power to you, and positive vibes xx
✨shore✨
so proud of you james!!!
Wooow it’s everything 😍😍💕
Absolutely Love James😊❤️This is absolutely inspiring🙌🏾🙌🏾👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Your dreams are valid and you can achieve all things you put your heart and soul into 👏🏽👏🏽 People respond to genuine passion and that’s why James is so successful because he loves what he does and the world responded. He knew 4/5 years ago what he wanted and today his living that dream. You deserve it James❤️🙌🏾👏🏽😊

You’re house looks great! I’m so happy for you and your success!! 💗😊

i can’t wait to have a house like this. you’re so inspirationallll😩😩😩😩
Amazing!
This house is kinda like Rebecca Zamolo’s new house
omg so many youtubers are uploading i dont know which to pick........
if his youtube career ever fails he could always become a great estate agent !!
His house is so aesthetic and nice. The colours really suit
The layout reminds me so much of Jenna marbles house
I used to not like james Charles when he started but getting to know him well he is pretty g So all the dislikes are from karens who hate the LGBTQ community

Dear James,  I have recently started a YouTube channel and was wondering about this 100 thousand dollars! I could use it to buy equipment for  my channel like maybe a vlog camera so I could start vlogging or maybe a pc. I’m trying to save up get a pc at my mothers house, as I just spent quite a bit to by one at my fathers house. I would also just save some of it! I hope I can get it, but if now, congrats to whoever does! ☺️ Edit: ❤️
Heyyyy
when ur so early that u already see the “why does james get so much hate” comment before 100 likes
James hi
Please learn to cook! It literally hurts my heart thinking about that stunning kitchen getting no use
when your house is so big you have to split its video into 2 parts
When he said “100,00” I literally could not breath.....
I love the whole vibe of the house it’s super simple decor and relaxing!
$100000? Including people from the Caribbean? I swear you're the best YouTuber no Cap!!! 😩😩😩❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯💯💯
We want gaming with James
عالی بود
this was actually so inspiring to watch. james literally had none of this 5 years ago and is a 21 year old who used his talent and work ethic to afford one of the most gorgeous houses i’ve ever seen. of course i’m jealous being the same age and finally about to graduate college, but man what he has done for himself is so fucking amazing
I’m in ah of his house 👁👄👁 all of that marble I’m gagging!!
How can he leave us on that cliff hanger!!!!!!!
Soo beautiful ❤️❤️
ABSOLUTELY STUNNING SISTER, an actual dream🥺🥰😍💁🏼‍♀️
All i can say is....ZAMNNNN
Can you make Arabic translation

Influencers don’t need a mansion made out of gold. I’m glad James found a home he is comfortable with.

“Literally 99% of you won’t see this...” **comments the same thing 47 times to make sure every one sees it**
I love you James! You deserve it all 🤍 you’ve done so many great things this year.
I hate the words to be continued🤣🤣🤣
His videos just get better and better! Im just so proud.
When someone who doesn’t know James asks “How many siblings do you have?” James: “One brother and 21 million sisters!”
Since you said we are sisters, I can come visit whenever I want, right?
Okay this home was freaking hugggeeee!!!! And there is a second part too??? Wtfff??
Well done You deserve this
His home is so gorgeous 😍😍 The interior designers and organizers did such an amazing job. It is beautiful and so spacious.   $100,000??? That would be amazing 😁😁😁 My husband and I are trying to get our own place with our two kids and that would be the biggest help ever. I would cry to be honest. Can't wait to find out how to get a chance.
You move did you it looks the same but it is really nice

To The one percent of people who see this: I hope your day is amazing and gets even better:) you’re beautiful and don’t let anyone tell you other wise😊💕
Please I am a big fan I been with you since you stared and me and my sister are trying to save up money some how to get new room decor and help are family
RUDE CLOFFHANGER
Hi james I dont have social media so i dont win any give always. Winning the money would be life changing it would change everything. I would love to win there is a chance you wont read this but if you do I love you and o love your house. Stay safe and well. From Tan
the random person who likes this will get a lucky life guaranteed.
Thank you James for being such an inspiration to the younger generation....you deserve everything you have and you are teaching us to workhard and make our dreams come true and be independent queens!!!🥰🥰
i hope he doesn’t give the 100k to a one person. i think it would be better to share it to 100 people so more people could get the help they need. obviously getting 100k is great but i think giving 1k to 100 people would be better.
Remember your amazing
James you are starting to look like Kris Jenner.
To the 1% reading this you'll become successful one day
Proud of you James!!!!!!
I’m simply brother broke
this looks like my house- are James and i neighbors-
so happy to see you striving and making something for yourself. its nothing but inspiring to me! <3
one hundred thousand. Oh my god.
Hey sisters! So that money is gon be mine and I’m not sister sharing...😗✌🏽

Hey we love a rich sister 💅🏽😌

His videos are so entertaining to watch . HE'S SUCH A SWEETHEART ( p. s, James ilysm.. I'm a teen just 14 yo but u made me jump into crazy and colorful looks.... I can't express how I feel about u into words. I u ever feel sad, just remember that all the sister love you too)  - sister urvashee 💋
