Get that idiot pogba off.
Why do they taking so long to fire 🔥 Ole. Look at Spurs they don't wast time.
Ole will play McFred for both the Spurs and City game, we will lose both games, embarrassingly, and united will NOT sack Ole.
it matters not who the manager is . if the over priced over paid players (talking about all clubs) on the field of play do not step up to the mark ,what can you the fans expect? talking as MU supporter since 1957 at the age of 7
Erik ten Hag is worth the wait. Been waiting nearly 10 years now mark.
Erm erm errrrrrm.. still has PTSD from the weekend
The sad truth is i am not exited anymore even if we win against spurs. We all know win or lose, its a lost cause. Ole will never ever rebuilt our club. OGS need to go! 100%!
All I I’ll say is, if Jose had this squad we would have at least one trophy, Of course i don’t want Jose back😂
You gotta start using timestamps man.
The new Banter Club. This is brilliant to watch
noir
Ole got the job, the mateys got their jobs, ole is now hanging on all thanks to Alex.. Dont blame the Board or Ole.. Alex will also choose the Ole replacement..
What drives me crazy is we play with 6 defensive players and still concede 5 at home?! Even Burnley wouldnt do that.
He should resign. He is destroying Manchester United
Why prolong the inevitable?
Before the Glazers let go of the this club there is no hope in hell that we will get anywhere. They don't consider it as a football club but rather as a cash cow .If they had football at heart we wouldn't be having this type of conversation but rather how to right the wrongs of this club and there is quite a few wrongs
SHIB INU 🚀
Great manager but man utd need to move on from the cult of Alex Ferguson. Arrigo Sacchi did wonders for AC Milan but you don't see him butting in. Anyway fergie left you lot with moyes!! Football has moved on so should man u
why not stop ignoring obvious?  SAF to come out of retirement to stabilize it with Paul Scholes and use Ronaldo as a player coach.  Problem solved...
OLE and the rest of the staff need to go as well. They need to sweep them all out and start over
The sad truth is " WHO ARE YEAH " ? HAS BEENS.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂LOSERS!
Divork is a better manager then ole. 😂
Sack on
To be real if OLE had played good attacking football n lost 5-0..I would still respect n gave him more time to prove himself but he's just so horrible..his tactics  team selections and substitutions in matches are unreal.. remember when he always used to say he was gonna play the United way?haven hear him said that for a long time now....this has been going on for 2years..clueless manager
Like when the owners of my club say I don’t matter because i live in America and can’t come to ground week in and week out
Everything this man is saying is just a made up conspiracy
Dude you are just so erratic and speak such bull. Ole is given a chance mate that’s it . I am gonna back and true United fans will have that respect for ole
We finished till this guy is gone 99 was long long time ago I'm not living in the past, we will be forgotten if this carries on
Have you even been to a United match ever
The United board is playing with fire. By not sacking Ole, they must be prepared to face the wrath of the fans if Spurs were to win. The Super league incident will repeat itself ...this time it will be worst
What I don't get is he's signed his contract running until 2024, why on earth does he not change the coaching staff if the team are playing so poorly? Surely can't play like this every game.
Man Utd might just about win a sack race.
Why would you willingly make a video on what the SUN reported and when pogba comes and dismisses it you say you aren’t interesting in hearing it?? Wtf is wrong with you, just gaslighting the situation
United fan's are chickens 🐔 in Manchester because they watching United getting fuckt every week not doing nothing.
Make De Gea or VARANE or Cristiano the captain........
Manchester utd are lucky and should extend ole contract! Ole in! Mutiny your right the boat takes one little hit and all the babies inthe pram start crying 😢 Manchester utd fans can't even face out a lil stormy weather and have no patience. You just want the club to be a revolving door and a new manager in every season. Let him finish the season and arsenal looking 👍👍👍 ya!gunners!
Any thoughts about getting Hansi Flick to manage United?
Hey carricky were fooked
Watching preston v liverpool and the liverpool fans are singing ole's at the wheel again. Quality
MG milking uniteds downfall
What a shambolic football club.  Liverpool of the 90s all over it. Mistakes back to back of mistakes.
I sort of fogave Ole for the humiliating Spurs defeat, now he has to go, the "spirit" and "dna" he purrs about, is ironically, being shredded like a Banksy at an art auction, by his own lack of profesisonalism. Our reputation is in tatters RIGHT NOW! Ole cannot rebuild that, sooner he's gone, the better.
0:46 - glitch in the matrix!
They're trying to buy an Indian Cricket Team during the most important match of the year for United. Tells you how much they actually care about a proper manager.
I'm shocked he's still there 😲
His press conference is gonna be so awkward
what is all those players that are not playing doing in the club? jones, mata etc
Give him time 😂
if OLE stays another year we wont even get top 4,
Fergie was at Carrington to  get fitted for a new club suit and not to speak to the players, if you believe the spin
Are United fans just daft? Success(trophies) isn't  immediate, isn't something that you can just buy. Success starts with a Vision, that is implemented by Strategies, supported by hard work and perseverance, to produce a Product The Glazers bought a successful club, benefited financially from the success of the club, yet failed to implement strategies to further the success of the club.  The fans need to stop wasting their time trying to change managers, coaches and players. UNLESS THE GLAZER'S VISION AND STRATEGIES FOR THIS CLUB CHANGE,THE FANS BETTER GET USED TO MEDIOCRITY!
There's no way conte will work with any of dem coaches
How come you guys don’t have this as a podcast anymore ?
I heard Eric Bailey said something to ole. Why he picked Maguire who was unfit ahead of him.
We have an entire coaching staff who are inexperienced. Carrick learning on the job, McKenna under 20 coach etc. It's a joke. I believe he would have done well if he had some experienced coaches
Hoping for a draw. ,?.. just so ole goes.. thats fucked up mark... shame on you
Woke club , gone woke … full of woke players … guess what
imagine after they questioned ole about giving harry maguire captaincy, ole gives the captaincy to fred
Put your fing phone down
Goldbridge will be hiking this for months it's a story. Bilbo baggins will still be there come what may no matter what is reported.
Very good analysis not what I expected
Is Fergie now an issue  because anyone will listen to his opinion top to bottom  out of respect in the position he holds at United ??
we are not going to get relegated but , players are just lazy
One week too many!!
Hours from the sack!
Were the words you were looking for 42 minutes in British favoritism? Or nepotism?
Fergie walking out has sealed his fate. Ole has until the next break with negotiations with the next target about to commence
Ole's at the wheel lads 😁
Do you honestly think that defensive set up will stop son moura and kane.lads  its united
Man these African experts on facebook are arseholes,EXPERTS OUT
You are becoming noisy
Ole going nowhere. 💪. 😂
Phil Neville it's not just the 5-0 it's everything what Ole says how he treats some players i.e DVB no tactics no plan no passion need I go on Ole out
100 agree….Martinez is a terrible manager, really bad
Was never happy with this muppet getting the job in the 1st place, and our fans blind loyalty towards ole ignoring his zero managerial credentials are just as much to blame.. And if you state the obvious you get called plastic! There are bigger club legends managing worldwide but the elite clubs are not giving out jobs based on sentimental values 🤦🏽‍♂️
Ole is a fraud
I wonder if Fergie comes back from retirement, will he be able to compete with Tuchel-Klopp-Guardiola?
Scrape wins against spurs & Atlanta. Draw with city. Ole keeps his job. Get humiliated by watford.
Goldbridge actually hit the nail on the head regarding the discrimination of non-English fans by the club and ex-players. I've felt it especially worrying recently with Ole singling out the singing section of OT as more or less the "true" United fans. I've seen it breed an especially toxic narrative amongst the fanbase recently with people trying to discredit those who want a new manager entirely due to the fact that they've never been to the stadium smh.
Ole at the wheel driving us over a cliff! 😡
The fact OLE managed to bring in such talent he must be given more games...you hate players backing OLE wow. It's true we have lost 4.0 before we ain't CHEALSEA we don't just sack our LEDGENs sorry about that you hard hard cold man
"United DNA" is tainted. Not a single ex United player/pundit putting the club first. They're all behind Ole despite the writing on the wall. Everyone needs to realise that these people aren't worth listening to!
The dictionary says it is fear of change
Fed up of these ex players running there trap, they only care  about there paychecks, they are not real united fans
Dont go to next game   and glazer lossning 💰
U actually give the most irrelevant points
Oh yeh u can't predict a win with these leopards there shithouses
Unfortunately for you GOLDBRIDGE the players do respect OLE clearly they must know they are not performing
Steady the ship? He's scuttling it!
OLE deserves a chance to pull off a miracle as he would literally break his back for Man united...the club and players know it he just needs to let his guard down and attack attack with amazing old school passing just when Paul schools was at the club OLE must surely know how it's supposed to be done
Why was he even given another week,  if it was any other manager they wouldn't have seen Monday as a United manage still, it clearly shows that this decision was made out of sentiment because ope is a club legend. He did a brilliant job building a solid team on paper he managed to bridge the gap between us and  City, Liverpool and Chelsea, arguably we're probably the strongest looking team in the EPL but tactically the man have no clue. It's clear that ole has lost the dressing room and keeping him there is affecting the team
solution why we concede is simple ,none of  them is tracking back , bruno ,rashford   ronaldo  greenwood  , no body
Don't know how the manager and staff can be so terrible when they carrick ole have literally been trained by elite coaches ther hole football carrer surly they picked up in so many training technical abilitys and they must know how to train top players surely
Prejudice is the word you were looking for Mark.
He is fooling himself about Pogba, You could count the amount of good games he has had for UTD on one hand.
Nooooooo....
It’s gone from Glazers out you’re not backing Ole to Glazers out because they’re backing Ole ... This has to be the lowest iq fanbase in the league. You’ve had one of the easiest clubs in the world to support for 30 years first sign of struggle and the crying starts
RONALDO for Captain & Bruno Vice Captain
Did you attend or you a Wally as well?
ole gunnar solskjaer united...
Man Utd's Long term - mates experiment is a failure.
All the things we said now is negativity of this club, even some people want this club not to win in the game vs spurs/atalanta/city. I thought its just a matter of time to get change the situation and the manager, because United want to make this thing happen smootly, full of respect with ole and well manages. I admitted i always backing solksjaer and never say: Ole out, but i know we need some changes and get back in the result. So even in this crucial time why we need to shout and mad to our club, like there are no times again after this result, cause i know all of you will never remember what ole make a positives even it happened. It really happened.  I just wanna say: WHY?
Ferguson probably is in charge behind the scenes and has been for a very long time since Ole's appointment. If I remember well it was he who championed Scott Mctominay and said he should always feature in big games. Does he really pick the team, and not Ole?
A mate of mine who supports City said he's ecstatic that Ole keeps his job,he  said  fans of all the other premier league teams will also be ecstatic that Ole's at the wheel.
I think its time that Gordon Ramsey comes and have a check in Man uniteds football kitchen!
Saf : NO ONE IS BIGGER THEN THE CLUB  Some people need to remember that philosophy .
Toxic ship until the owners go  or stop running the club as a cash cow. Settling for top 4 only is not good enough! If we can even finish in the top 4.
Without international fans United can't overpay for British mediocrity.
It’s not progress if we’re in this spot every year… it’s like moving round a circle . Play extremely well for a period and land in the same place after a while every year
I really don't want Conte... I can't get why people do.
Accept the reality that the Glazers will continue controlling ManUnited. Nobody can afford to buy the club, not even the Arab billionaires.!!
"Stay true to their feelings", they are footballers who should want to win. If they do not want to win, I don't want any of them at my club.
No foreign manager will ever become manager of  ManUnited as far as Sir Alex Furguson is concerned.
Mark you should do a show evaluatingall SAF former players now turned managers. None have been great managers. Ole has been the best but all others have disappointed
Phil Neville just like his brother were and are shite managers. Better just to ignore them.
The last video was literally titled pogba wants solskjaer out😅😅😅
It's like the YTS in the 80s .. everybody's learning on the job .. ⚽️I hope there on £27.50 a week..
No such thing as a stay of execution. Solskjaer will continue to stay until his contract expires 2024. Cheers!
THE BOARD AINT PREPARED FORBTHIS FOOTBALL CLUB PERIOD, OLE OUT!
Bro, it's done, he's staying, relax, no point in losing it.
Paul Merson said: In a way I feel sorry for Solskjaer. Yes, he picks the team, but it's these players who are getting beaten 5-0. They are hiding behind the manager.   Solskjaer has shown a lot of faith in a lot of players and they are letting him down - big time. That is probably the biggest shame of all.  The players need to call each other out and be honest with themselves over their performances. As a player you know when you walk off a pitch if you've left everything on it, you just know.
Why do people even listen to the Neville brothers and Paul Scholes and Roy Keane.. they carnt manage f@%k all .. that's why they think ole gunna do nowt is world class .. everybody can see the problem.. and its them .. clear the lot out .. there all looking for hand outs of the back of our club .. parasites.
How can The Norwegian or his coaching staff have any respect from the players? The Norwegian lost it from the day he was appointed full time, which the Man U board had a plan but caved in because he went on run and then beat PSG in Paris? They should have waited until of the end of the season.
Is Ole that insane he thinks those players are going to put a shift in to save his job. Hmmm expect another drubbing v Spurs. They want him gone
The United board haven't had plan in place since Fergie left
Agree its a myth re man management.  The reason why it appeared that way for a time is because Ole had lied to so many staff and told them what they wanted to hear i.e. players (i.e. DVB, Bailly, Telles, Lingard etc) will get game time. Ole is the worst man manager (probably because he is so nice) and not able to have the difficult conversations, all his lies are unravelling now.
Have zero interest until we have a proper manager in the shape of Ten Hag or Conte
Ole in 🤣
One more week after one more week, keep delaying like Ed Woodward, they all never going to get fired
"The Luckiest One"
Best away fans in the world is abit of a stretch mark?
The only way that the Glaziers, Woodwood and in incompitant board will listen is if people stop going to OT and stop buying the merchandise
Sir Alex needs to leave Manchester alone and stop making decisions.
GBridge: I wont predict a loss, but I wont predict a win. What a prat.
When beckham got sent off for England and they got knocked out the media posted photos of dummies being hung outside pubs but that’s not as bad as saying sack ole if it was sack mourinho theyd be pushing it
They need a manager that has balllss and they listen and he win the dressing room
Goldbridge don't want to hear what they say about pogba is a lie bit he always jump on anything he think pogba says thats bad thats how he is bias
What club does Phil Neville coach again ???? What title have Phil Neville won as a coach ?
Think hes staying put now until end of the Season.  Realistically only Conte and Zidane are adequate levels of replacements. Zidane doesnt want to relocate to England and our Board have reservations on Contes work methods which I dont agree with.
The only reason Solskjaer is not getting let go is due to a heavy compensation Glazer will have to pay.
SAF as care taker manager.
Conte would improve the likes of Dalot, Telles & Shaw to make them a force at wingback.
How can we get a response ? Leicester was not really good either... yet they beat us.. Spurs will beat us !!!
This is becoming a witch hunt
If the old Liverpool supporter Ole have loved this club he would have resigned immediately after that horrifying display
Your liveihood is on the United Stand bread Abd butter
There is always somebody calling him but he Wont Name the caller
This Pratt is doing all good best to bring MU down
if ole is at utd i will not watch his rubbish tactics
If these ex-players think what is happening at OT is ok, then they are talking out their arse.
What happen to "need more time"?
Ole will still be there till the season end. We might win against spurs and even Atalanta and again they will go ole at the wheel. so..basically we are a f***ed club. We are the next Arsenal. irrelevant.
Very disappointed because Ole didnt resign!! If I were in his position I wouldnt be able to handle the shame,and therefore resigned immediately.I believe he has lost all credibility and also believe that,"how can he motivate the players,"how can he expect these players to respect him." He couldnt get the best from them prior to this issue so hes no chance now.Its a sorry state of affairs which is made worse because the board appear not to have the balls to dismiss him!
Support OLE ✅ Give him new 5 year contract🥰 Now👍
Am sure against Totenham ole will bring back the same team 😂😂
At this point Derby are a better run club than us
With this sorryin for people and the board mentality man utd will never win epl again
What a complete joke this club is.  Getting the sack on Monday, getting the sack on Tuesday, greeting the sack next week.......
ITS TIME TO GOOOOOOO!!!!!!
I reckon the players will throw the next few games
Considering Ole's track record of having won multiple premier league and champions league titles, it's only fair that he is completely backed and given more time unlike the case of that Mourinho guy who got Cardiff relegated
SAF is doing what ole needs to do , he taking training session, talking with player for transfer . Remember when SAF was taking Bellingham for carrington tour
Seriously, stop going on about Zidane as a potential Utd manager just because he won three CLs.  It’s never going to happen. His league record was hardly great, he’s just as temperamental and likely to challenge the board or just quit as a Conte, but most importantly he doesn’t speak English as he’s already on record saying he’s not interested in managing in the Prem.
Mark needs to be on overlap
Ole has not got the personality or character to be a manager. That's what Klopp, Guardiola and all the greats have. He's a pathetic weak man.
we need an aggressive manager.. Am very sure Conte is United type of manager not ole..
Buying a football club is just an other way to tax avoidance
Thanks Mark for the brilliant insight on foreign players, foreign fans (in a broad sense) ... it was spot on and well said.
Ole can't coach football team...and 4-2-3-1 can't use with this squad
Manchester United is a $2 Billion asset to the Glazer's. They own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers here in the US. They just won the Super Bowl last year. They are flush with cash as a business. As long as the asset is worth $2 billion or more, we the fans get the finger. The bottom line speaks loudest. Until fans stop going to the games, stop buying the jerseys and the sponsors go away depreciating that asset they will not change.
Despite all these,Ole will still start Magelof and Mcfred against spurs.
Gonna miss the Ole Carricky impressions 😪
i don't care anymore...ole needs to go...glazers need to be forced out by any means necessary...idc about what he did as a player...be ruthless fire him...don't matter what he did...
No one can work under next game threat, that alone shows poor leadership from the board. Ole and his team should be having some detailed chats with Sir Alex for technical team input.  We’ve been through how many managers now and all have failed. The players also need to hold some responsibly their performances have been awe full.
Ole isn't going anywhere.He is here to stay for this season. # stand with ole
Sack him now 🙄
Learning deficiency is a real thing. How else can anyone explain Ole. If only his mates would only look at him in the eye and say these word: “you tried your best but it’s time to move on.” It’s sad because this football club doesn’t belong to Gary Neville nor Alex Fergusson. This club is for everyone and that includes the fans. We are the biggest cheerleaders. Without us this club wouldn’t be where it is. But what do we get for our support? Misery. Betrayal by ex footballers who are all looking out for a potential pay day or further role within the club someday. Shocking! Pathetic! Nobody cares anymore about the growth of the club. No one cares about competing with the best in the world. It’s all about rallying together to save the career of a failed mediocre quack manager. This club has fallen from lofty heights and now wallowing in the dirt. Everyone who loved this club once are all guilty of the betrayal we see before our eyes. Shambles.
I have no respect for Phil Neville's comments...get away...concentrate on your job in Miami.
SAF should be our interim sack Ole now
Ed Woodward was on holiday in Barbados (seriously!) - give him a break! Btw, Man Utd did have a plan - they gave him a 3-year contract in the summer. What Ole needs is an experienced 2nd in command/assistant coach. Kieran McKenna is out of his depth!
Ole's not lucky. City is gonna put up a huge number and double his humiliation
Phil Neville sounds like a Karen “the police will come if you ask for someone to get a sack” …the way ex players are defending Ole is shameful…they are basically putting Ole before the club…besides Scholes no one is criticizing him…
We need conte. We dont want poch. Hes bad
Why the board never considered gasperrini? He might be the right guy for us. Viva the devil!!!
If a Manchester United manager can lose heavily to liverpool and keep his job tells you all you need to know where this club is and what we are
Giggs is quite these days
As I said before, I won't be watching another match with us until Ole is gone..
How dare some explayers treat us like morons, without us they wouldn't have a job
🤫 Solskjaer is about as bright as Biden
Sir Alex was scheduled to visit the training ground well in advance of the game against Liverpool. He would still be coming if the team won 5-0. For god's sake, do some research before spouting your opinions as facts. Everyone is entitled to an opinion sure, but this presenter assumes to talk on behalf of an assumed majority, with nothing but personal takes... nothing to back any of this up. Again...fine to do this but have the humility to be upfront that what you are presenting is a personal viewpoint based on emotion; not a reflection or representation of anything real.
Pogba speaks out on this but anytime his agent pipes up you don’t hear a peep out of him makes you think he wants these things to be said 👀
How you can have any respect for OGS after what he's done to your club is beyond me. He should of walked
If I was ole I would thank the club fans and admin and resign step down he cannot continue he cannot offered better than this
Carrick is a bigger problem than Ole…he has now been part of two failed management teams…
Mark is optimistic  🤣
Mark pogba isn't signing because of United not Ole. Even if Ole left, he wouldn't sign because the club is ran like a brand
Let s not forget most of these players have down tools on three managers already!🤯
Part of the problem with United is the players- how many really really want to be there....what is their plan for buying players- like with Arsenal they want to buy really young players and have made a committment to build from them- why actually did we buy Sancho? Did we just buy Ronaldo because we thought he was going to Man City?  I watched Ronaldo against Liverpool and he virtually walked or at best jogged around. Look at Brentford- they have passion and desire and fight like a unit. We as a unit have none
Ferdinand and neville are after jobs at old Trafford.
The sheer arrogance and utter contempt shown by the Neville brothers have frankly tarnished both of them. Both of them need to realize that they are distinguished former players of Manchester United, not merely two angry, xenophobic lads from Bury.
How is that even possible????
what a waste of 6 points and potentially a champions league place. the crazy decisions made at this club continue to baffle me completely.
The Glazers and Ole caught with the pants down again
The Glazer's are businessmen,Woodward is a businessman as is the person who's replacing him.I urge you to realise we are a business now,we stopped being a football club when the Glazer's took over.Our name should be changed from Manchester United to MUFC business enterprise.
I don't care how he did at Ipswich and Sunderland but i definitely would love Roy Keane at the helm👺With Someone like Lauren Blanc along side him....
Mark thinks that there using spurs as a bounce back game because there not very good! Spurs look at man utd in the same way! There at home they have more points and won more games! So not sure about a bounce back game
I remember a season where after this many games United were down in 10th, and City were 13th and 8 points from the top.  City went onto win the league and United finished 2nd. It was last season.  Sorry, I know we're all supposed to pretend this is some unseen catastrophe and that last years start wasn't worse but just thought some facts might help with all the drama
Zidane said no. Why are people still talking about him for the job? It’s over. Move on…
Another few weeks of fucking torture. Great...
Zidane winning trophies doesn't mean he's a tactician
Great to see United in free fall 👍👍 keep it up Chaps !
I’m sorry but genius in their feet and sawdust in their brain is the perfect way to describe some footballers 😂💀
Those leaking news of players speaking badly of ole , You believe in it, if players backing the manager , and you said is PR spin..
I'm glad Mark you are now Ole out at last ,nice guy but he's just not upto the job ,or the background staff ,need fresh start ,and move so many players on
Ten hag is going to Barca😅
What is the point? This not fair to Ole. Pundit and glazers threat him unfairly by prolong uncertainty. Prolong wounded relationship between fans and Ole seem harsh.
Mark nice analysis
Every time I think the owners/board can’t possibly be more incompetent than this, they surprise me…almost like they are exceeding expectations, unfortunately not in a good way…
Ole out
Mark, your analogies are hilarious and there are many.
Anyone here has billionaire parents that might consider buying over man Utd?
There ya go...... blaming the owners *Again*.... yano the 1’s, them that have thrown nothing but ££££££££’ssssssss at Ole’ for players! Unfookinbelievable 🤦‍♀️
Ronaldo making fun of Ole tactics lol 😂
Players, ex players and fans should fight against the owners and not against each other
Spurs are rubbish, but they're better than us right now. Three losses are the most likely from the next three games. All the horrible on pitch issues won't be fixed by this coaching staff in a few tumultuous days.
I could be wrong but has any ex utd player been a decent manager
There is one word for this : SHITSHOW
Are you for real, do you think MANU will win any of the next 4-5 games. You must be dreaming mate. With such performance you will be lucky to get one point from Norwich. That is the level of our beloved club under Ole.
Who gives a f*** about what Phil Neville says. This is your problem at United …. Your so beholden to the class of 92 and Fergie. Much like us clinging on to the boot room in the 90s. Until you kindly ask Sir Alex to not attend games (or sit in a box out of the cameras gaze) so the camera doesnt constantly pan to him EVERYTIME anything happens, heaping pressure on whatever poor sod you have in the dugout you will never progress … and dont get me started on his brothers performance in the studio on Sunday 🤬
😂
It’s spurs yooo Not EFL cup They are bottlers yes but they deliver some good matches every year  If it’s a son or Kane’s day  United are doomed.
They need to keep the fans divided because they are too dangerous when united
Please, please keep him! I'll not want anything else for Christmas!
U still not getting it.united owners had their vengeance with united fans when they invaded pitch against the same fixture
British privilege seems to what mark is talking about
Social media is a sesspit ok. Why are you on it then (tool)
Mark backing what the sun puts out now? jesus
The owners want profit.less salaried manager that's y he is still there. If he wins a cup with luck. They will still keep how poorly team plays.
I dont care how old Steve Bruce is, he's available and he's got to be a better option than Maguire
The owners are in India buying a cricket team. They won’t sack ole
Ten Haag for manager  Scholes for Director of football
Too much old boys network with these ex players.. I used to respect them now I just want them to clear off really.
I’m with you mark. We are all fed up mate.
Ole is the lightning rod on top of Old Trafford, the Glazers are gonna fight like hell to keep it up there...
Man. UTD. Socials are filled with Ole Out! He can't survive now!😅
We got loads pens last season we got one this season shows that we not even in the box as much from last
Why didn't the board sack him yesterday? What does a week do. The week could be crucial to our season.
So the new baseline for sacking a manager in UTD is not even 5  nill loss to their rival. STANDARDS!!😆😆👏
I love Sir Alex but why and how did the glazers get a foothold in the club, it's mainly due to his fall out with magnier and McManus, I agree the board are inept but Sir Alex has some of this on his shoulders it's something that is never mentioned
Why is noone talking about simone? He's a long term manager and has made athletico a solid team for years now.
Rogers is a realistic shout the job is too big to turn down plus he has the players there already good couching for a couple of months get top 4 and have a right go at the big trophies next season , he knows the league inside out so no settling in period , he plays good attacking football , players improve under him , he took a team of Liverpool donkeys bar Suarez , and an ageing Gerrard to one game away from the league title , plus he’s played champions league football with Leicester . Madison floats around and Vardy is the focal point so he’s got Bruno and Ronaldo - Cavani to play the way he already does , sign a good DM play Donnie and Pogba and Pogba is playing where he did for Euve .
This clubs 🤦‍♂️
United treating Ole like he won the treble 😂
Tbf who has a plan in place for managers failing? The narrative at United has always been to give the manager time as well. Let's be consistent please..... Ole needs to go, I don't agree with the hindsight nonsense
“United have the best away fans” didn’t you hear the Liverpool fans on sunday there was so many fewer yet we was louder than that United fans in the ground!!
Mark, Sir Alex went to Carrington for something else. I am beginning to believe to you are a poisonous person.
Of course, they know more than you. You are just a central part of donut. .
GLAZERS OUT OUT OUT OUT
Diversity can be a good thing, or it can be poison. Right now it's poison because it's being promoted and implemented by evil people and sociopaths.
Knee jerk world. What does ‘undermining’ - regarding SAF attending training etc - even mean ? It’s not undermining, it’s a show of strength to get the right mentorship. Most people try to push on until they know they absolutely need it, especially under pressure. In contrast, SAF was good at seeing what was needed ahead of time. Ole much less so. But he can learn this. Defo a better structure needed around him. To the united ‘DNA’ not being key? If you don’t have it, then what are you supporting, a brand only. Ole has in many ways brought back that feeling. What ever manner we move forward, supporting a manager who’s struggling, is a distinction between united and other teams. Did it with fergie for his 1st 5 years. Xenophobia? A Swedish manager, top paid players are not British? If you’re going to make such statements, talk sensibly. Nothing factual, you’re giving a narrative that is based upon pure conjecture. Prejudice is a human bias for sure.   It’s not a dictatorship; standard include qualities such a loyalty and sticking with a team through tough patches. This is Oles first true tough patch. It’s been a slow upward projection until now. Was Fergie xenophobic when he chose to get rid of Pogba originally. Give a direct comparison.
Tottenham will win . Atalanta be a draw and city wil carve us up .
As much as I want UTD to win at Spurs so much...it will mean they won't sack Ole and I want that more so UTD will have to drop more points in order for things to change. Go SPURS💪😩
Ole in his firsr three months played more  expansive football. And during this time, we enjoyed watching football.
So is Ole a Caretaker Manager again? Watch us go on a 15 game winning run.
Phil Neville “Inter Miami” team is about to get stuff tonight by Atlanta F.C. That fool.
Dear Mark, thanks for speaking up for the majority of the fans. I’m so tired and disgusted with this whole saga. Ole should be gone period.  Manchester United need to reset.  A new way of playing football must come in for the club. We need a new manager and coaches.  Ole should have been gone last year.  The board is totally incompetent.
Zidan had a prime Ronaldo. Without Ronaldo zidan has won nothing.
💄🐷
Black sails vibes .....ole  is capt  Flint
This is like sbmm in games if you don’t like sbmm you’re classed as toxic and stuff
I’m sorry but there is also racism in football if Pogba and Rashford were White they wouldn’t get as much criticism/abuse.
What are the odds that McFred start against Spurs ?? It will beggar belief if they do....
Am getting abit worried about ole, after we got hammered by Liverpool, he said were nearly there, nearly where? The bottom of the table, worse manager in premiership history in my opinion
Phill neville for the sack
Paul ince seems to love social media
Slab head is a better captain that whiny fenadez
Funny how these pundits will sit and happily say that players aren’t good enough but as soon as it their mates in managerial jobs they have a mental breakdown. Embarrassing
Draw with Spurs, draw with ManC and heavy lost to Atlanta will do .
Ironic : Phil nevile calling social media as cesspit    on social media.. Ex players  want to put there opinion on social media  but don't want to  hear  the opinions of others on social media..
Please no hes had long enough what are they waiting for get him out please this is ruining my mental health
I’m starting to think that the lack of sacking Ole is the Glaziers protecting their asset to help prop up the buying of the Indian Premier League Cricket team. If they sack Ole it would wipe millions off the share value of the club as it admits failure. They’d rather just pull out the rose tinted glasses and keep plodding on with the hope of 4th with Ole & Co.
I hope the only reason we are taking this long is because we are trying to get Enriques,Ten Haag or Pochetino.
Mark ...we don't need analogies every minute .... we get it ...!!!!!
The scary thing is I believe they believe they (the board and owners) are acting in a professional and competent way. I can just see them in their bubble patting each other on the back.  Total cowards they don't consult directly with the fans. Ole out and then Glazers out.
Its very telling the only specialist appointment United board have made is a PR person. No football people. Fans seem to have forgotten SAF fell out with the previous owners over a horse that then led to them selling the shares that brought the Glazers into the club.
I cannot understand how some idiots can sit here and say they don't want conte and want to stick with this fraud  conte may play a defensive style but at least he's good at it! This fraud parks the bus EVERY GAME and is clueless!! We get dominated by just about every1 wake up people THE FRAUD NEEDS TO GO NOW!!!!!
Mark " Erghhh" Golbridge
Why is mark moaning here? Wasn't he the one who told us to stop moaning about ole out at the beginning of the season becoz he said that even if ole perform bad the glazers wouldn't sack him.. back him mark like you said.. so stop moaning..
I don’t feel sorry for Ole. How did he get the job in the first place?
Amazon would've made a fortune if had chosen United for their documentary this year
Whoever mentioned Roberto Martinez as next man utd manager in the live chat today OMG hang you head in shame lol seriously!
Watch SAF Be on the touchline against spurs with OLE
Glazers:- The fans in the ground or more important than the fans in social media in the world.  Also Glazers:- Match going fans and local fans are legacy fans. The global fans/international fans are more important. (During Super League).
There are more great players that are horrible coaches than good coaches that used to play. Just because you can kick does not translate  you into a grandmaster of chess
The fact that Ole may should or not go is academic at the moment, Conte is not the solution as you already know Mark. Ole is there till the summer where the chances of getting Ten Hag or Poch go up.
Roberto martinez would make me sick
Can all utd fans do a survey which we can express the main things we aren't happy with and what we want.
Liverpool have absolutely broke yous hahaha
"Genius in their feet and sawdust in their heads" couldn't be more accurate Mark. The problem is these wet woke people like phil neville have lost the plot of reality. Business is business and if you don't perform and have had chances then your fired. End of
Becoming Arsenalfantv this channel.
CONTE IN
2:54 Pot-kettle when this 🤡 criticises the owners for not turning up to games after he’s profiting so much from club and hasn’t set foot at old Trafford in years.
When you are judged week by week, that means it's already over for that specific job. They're just planning ahead.
Did Roy Evans work out for Liverpool? Was it good for them to have Shanks hanging around the training ground? We need standards. Club DNA doesnt matter as much as winning DNA.
He’s done. Everyone knows he’s done. Gallardo, ten Hag, or even Conte would be a big improvement.
That Liverpool performance should by on sky movies under comedy
I'm at that point where I just don't give a toss anymore. He should have went after the Everton game.
I’ve never seen a manager go back to an “Interim” position 🤣🤣🤣 such a joke! Good job Glazers and Woodward 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Change isn’t simply sack the manager, it’s what changes are required. Fergie took 5 years to turn the ship. He had fully formed managers alongside him for much of his success - Smith, Queiroz, McLaren etc - or senior figures (Kidd etc), and was more ruthless with crap players. One’s favouritism and blind spot with certain players +\- tactical weakness in some areas required change. But, to say he’s not a good manager per se, hasn’t managed to make some tactical approaches work very well (beating city multiple times), and hasn’t until the last few games, made us competitive again is simply to ignore reality. Mark;  knee jerk, this situations has to be placed in context, and statistical truth of how teams have runs of form. Initial solution Would be to sensibly bring in an experienced coach who is not a yes man. Then see what happens. There has been progress. Statistically you have periods of bad form. How can you know if this is not that, with his weaknesses being exposed also. The cycle of three years isn’t true. They have built, and bought well progressively with Ole. A midfield of VDB, Fernandez + another = very strong. Ones choice and tactics with the midfield are an issue. So is backing lindeloff and not selling pogba much earlier. If we do change mangagers, playing youth players again is a must rather than simply attempting to solve all problems through transfers.
IMAGINE POCH COMING IN AND BECOMES THE FIRST MANAGER TO COACH THE TWO GOAT IN THE HISTORY
Conte would get you short term success but isn’t he quite explosive tho, he might fall out with the players or owners in the end
United are afraid to hire Conte. They know he won't put up with any nonsense from the board. He won't toe the line like Ole or someone of that ilk.
Brendon Rogers?
Ole please take Maguire with you to Molde please ffs
I Can See Spurs Smashing Us,, As They Wont Take There Foot Off The Gas Like L-pool Did I Can See A 7-2 Thrashing,,,, Ole And All The Matey Coaching Staff Need To Go,,,,,,
If we get ten Haag I want Edwin VDS running the football operations as he's actually been an ex player who has properly run a football club. There needs to be a complete overhaul in staff where you have two divisions, a commercial one and a football one where in the commercial one you have these people handling brand deals, investments in the club like reconstruction on OT, improving Carrington, funding in the youth academy but like Edwin handle the football structure, appointing the DOF, Youth coaches, managers.
OLE OUT
I am sure he will the matches against Tottenham,Atlanta and maybe city with his ultra instinct activated and then he will return to his normal base form and start drawing and losing matches... and the cycle will continue forever.... 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Why would we go for Poch? He was free and there waiting and we allowed Ole to continue. This club has no vision! Each time a proper manager is available we delay and then we employ the best of the rest. We missed Pep, Ancelotti, Poch, Conte,  and Allegri. The days of long-term managers are dead. Three to five years a few trophies and they go. The elite clubs want to win trophies while United has become a training camp for former players.
Mark please stop mentioning mental health in the context of a football team losing a couple of matches. Many other clubs have suffered far worse than losing to Leicester away and 5-0 at home to Liverpool. It's trivialising mental health to suggest football is relevant in that context. Get a grip mate.
Mark Literally repeated himself over and over again to start the video
Everyone gets called out when they not performing no matter who they are or were there from look at Shaw Maguire rashford and wan bissaka it's not just pogba martial and de gea tht get it
🚫OLE OUT🚫
The Glazers were prepared. Do you think they would have risked coming into that stadium knowing Liverpool might destroy us? The amount of abuse they would've taken on Sunday. I wouldn't dare walk into that either.
I remember the 5 nil loss to Newcastle clearly. We actually played well in that game. It's just that Newcastle played better. Most fans were not annoyed post that game.
Glazers out yea but you realize they're the owners right?? Be realistic.
Imagine Dalglish coming to the training ground telling the players get behind Klopp. Wth is this. They wouldnt respect him anymore and Klopp would not even allow it
ALWAYS WANT TO CRITICAL SOLSKJEAR  WHY DO GO TO MANAGE UNITED
Phil Neville a legend🤣 he nearly cost us the treble with that stupid tackle that gave Arsenal a penalty. He couldn't even coach the England women's team successfully.
Because of our easy run of fixtures I thought we’d look like we were challenging and then be exposed by the big teams
The funny thing is that Gary Neville is a bigger Man Utd legend than Ole. Imagine if he gets the job next. What would it take to sack him?
GLAZERS OUT!
They were busy bidding for an ipl team at the time.
"The Glazer's weren't at the glame on Sunday." They're definitely to glame for a lot of this 💩!
Please dont sack Ole. We are loving it!!!
Gary is jealous that fans' opinions heard more than his
Not at the game🤣🤣🤣says the match day bedroom dweller.
Alex was due to go to Carrington before the result against Liverpool. It was arranged long before that match.
“Sign a contract if you Love Ole so much”?? What a dumb statement
Let not a single man u supporter be in the stadium against man city just the opposing team supporters if they have any crying and shouting ole at the wheel..
Lets see the next press conference before the Spurs game
The difference,  before social media the fans couldn't voice their opinion publicly on their own. Now we have the power to go public on our own and go viral.
I hope spurs thumps man united
sir alex came and handled the situation and try to calm everyone said it all. ole no longer can't handle this squad, have too many up and down, favoritism over some players, and they way he handle 2nd team players are awful.
Why would any board have a replacement ready - it’s a ridiculous argument and completely impractical.
“He has to go blud” ~ zac efron during the making of high school musical
Would prefer Ten Haag at the end of season and have SAF as interim boss!
Ex players don’t make Utd Managers remember Wilf McGuiness years ago! It’s obvious the board don’t want Conte for the reasons we all know or he would be in place now, so who do they want?
wont even watch games until solskjaer and his team leaves. They have sucked the life out of this team.
The players can back ole in the media but will they back him  on the pitch that's the question.
I completely agree but ronal do made solkjaers situation worse
That’s the excuse they will use 🤣
Its like in a sunday leagues club where the brother of the coach plays every week even he has 120kg and cant kick a ball 😂
This whole debacle just further goes to highlight the ineptitude and lack of care from the owners. I worry all the talk in the media of Ole is masking the issues higher up.
Ed Woodward isn’t even at Utd mate. He left so that’s why he wasn’t there at the game ?
Now watch man utd beat spurs and they management says ole job is safe since they bounced back
When a player on the bench has to point out to ole that he can't switch to a 4-4-2 because they don't have enough players left on the pitch then where in trouble
Watching Mcfred feels like I'm watching children run around the playground after drinking some coffee . No control, no discipline just wild energy and its crazy to me Ole is this stubborn. We're losing because of his stubbornness. He can't accept that he isn't good enough.
Phil Neville is a little bit deluded…
So sacking ole wont be happening but pls dont play maguire the nxt game
P Nev is a fool. And not a very good coach. He should also get the sack.
Mark u didn’t speak on the stories coming out of the dressing room from players frustrated with Olé
Man U should look at Graham Potter! Excellent manager with a promising future that has never failed in his former clubs
Fergie needs to take a back seat and chill now. He has way to much influence at this club. The United DNA was dead and buried when fergie left. It’s time to hire a manager who has a proven style of attacking football and let him build his own DNA. The ex players need to keep their beaks out of the club as well.
Drop Maguire, drop Rashford, drop Bruno who's lack of effort tracking back was criminal on two of the goals.  ANYONE at CB, Lingard and Sancho in. May as well play DVB. Don't play your half-arsed terrible press. Simple.
I just feel bad for Sir Alex watching Utd in this state after making us win a lot of trophies
WE'RE going to win on Saturday but regardless Ole needs to leave, he proved to us over along time he has no system and isn't a competent manager. For me for along time his subs even when winning were incredibly poor and if you can't get that right then you can't run a massive club. We've turned into Favorites fc .
The nevilles are deluded
Glazers were distracted by their IPL franchise bids.
I cried after that liverpool loss get this fraud of a manager out of my fucking club
It’s horrible what lot are doing to this man. Take a look in the mirror and have a minute, its bordering on online harassment
we re a bunch of losers
Wait. Did you just say at 28:35 that Zidane's Madrid played good football? Sure, they won quite a few UCL cups. But not for playing good football.
I wonder if there is a new coach..if Donny would play?
amateur hierarchy
Our glorious club has become a circus at this point!
dictatorial united
Meanwhile Barca want klopp
Chelsea felt no way in sacking Lampard their legend.  why are we messing about. sack him still respect him as a player shake hands and move on to the next chapter.
Liverpool could score 9-10 goals in that match, and Ole 100% gone by now
Ole ain't short of a Penny. He should walk.
The club is steeped in mediocrity from the board to the coaching staff. The club is not run properly.
0:45 forgotten his name already.
I have mental issues because of ole.I want to crushed my tv so bad
Conte would blow the joint up piss everyone  off but would at least win something
Respond to all the bullshit PR tweets with blunt qs - what is being done to improve standards, what is changing so we can improve as a team, what is the plan???
Mark as you have said Ole is a very lucky man if we have beaten W Ham in League Cup today Man City would have thrashed us badly
GLAZERS OUT
Man u what is going on ole out how hard could it be
I will always like Ole and Carrick as players! I am sure everyone will! But as coaches NO! they tried their best, didn't work now it is time to GO!
Next time United will win a title  is in 30 years
Ollie’s at the wheel boys, enjoy.
Why don't Ole just change his staff instead of the board changing him
Stupid board team!!!
Ole at the steal.
DNA, the united way, whatever ... Who would you trust to face klopp and guardiola if your life depended on it?
Glazers got out bid in there Attempts to buy IPL team & went Home Empty Handed.
The sad comparison under the current manager. Neither given a proper chance. Angel Gomes - Donny van de Beek.
One thing I cant understand and its annoying me since Sunday is Ole saying in an interview after the game “that we can't give up we are so close”. Close to what exactly? Losing 5-0 and regressing, we are close to what exactly?? He is deluded, stubborn, and has no tactical knowledge. He isn't even a good man manager. He is a good and likeable guy, but being a nice guy doesn't make you a leader and doesn't necessarily make you a good man manager.
You believe what you want to believe
if Ole has any gut or responsibility then he should've resigned and keep his legend status
The players might not believe in Solskjaer but they are trying, the tactics don’t work. Solskjaer and the coaches CANT and WONT change there tactics. We have hit a wall.
It all starts with the owners. Ambitious owners would’ve sought the best-in-class across the whole set up. Not settle for a yes man with no tactical know-how.
Ole going nowhere
Let's go brandon
It's going to turn out the same way :we might pull out a lucky win due to our star studded squad and that is going to delude ole and the board even more, which is scary !!
I AM HOPING FOR A DRAW AGAINST SPUDS LMAO GOLLUM HAS TO STAY AT BANTER CLUB UNITED. COYGGGG
Phil Neville a great...this guy is hilarious 🤣
Bang on about Phil Neville. He’s so out of touch.
You see Werd Video of paul scholes sucking his daughter toes?  Very werd in deed.  He also said pogba the problem
Watch out !!! Newcastle might just be ahead of United to get Conte.
Totally different attitude towards Ole compared to previous coaches... Untouchable, above criticism, just because he's a legend PLAYER. People need to be objective and look at performance. The only difference to Mourinho is that nobody felt a connection to him. If it was Mourinho right now in this situation people would be shouting Toxic environment, bad man management, unappealing football, bad results. The truth is Ole had full support that Mourinho never got.. embarrassing
So the board haven't got enough time to bring someone else in although Conte has basically said come & get me. They're waiting on another yes man. Small club mentality; instead of going for who Utd should go for they're going to wait for another club to go for them so we can have their yes man. Ole has stuck with players who haven't looked at him like he doesn't know what he's doing.
BTW… Ole has already beaten Guardiola, Klopp and Tuchel…
Ole is slowly ruining his legend status at this club so just leave him to it and he will probably just walk.. if he had any love left for us  that is!!!
Ole must take some responsibility for this because if he ignored his ego and tried players benched, moved into a more midfield structure in getting the ball up as his last effort then I'd say"u tried everything with the club as your focus" I was always Ole in because of the player status but as a manager, nope. His ego clouded his vision
Phil Neville is a fool and looks like one too
When you choose to follow propaganda
Am am am am am am slosjear 🤣🤣
When man utd loss to europa league final against Villarreal I know that this manager is going to bottling down club and players career even The Goat CR7
Can ya remember them days  When in August you knew 100% that United was in a Title race!!🥊
problem with ten Haag is that he's from Ajax, Board might bench him for the season.
As much as ole isn't up to it more than a few   players are stealing a wage
I gotta hand it to the glazers , they run the bucs really well
Before slagging people off for not going to games how about you attending one!!!!!
If we are realy serieus,  try and get Overmars&Ten hag, before The Geordie's will
Would be so nice to see Pogba play for Conte again. He was so amazing those years in Juve and Conte is such a strong attacking force ✊✊✊
The we are Manchester United guff has to stop, it does not count for much these days.
Ole is Living prof that it’s better to be lucky than good.
Ole "go out and express yourselves" Solksjaer
SAF going to the training just shows how weak Ole is, imagine someone going into Liverpools training to back up klopp for example? Sad.
😔
Would U take sir alex as interim until summer and then get Enrique or ten hag? I know he retired and deserves it but can’t think of any better solutions right now
This myth about conte turns against players is a joke in all the clubs he has managed he leaves because he stood up against the authorities......juve he wins 5 years in a row wins the league with chelsea in his first year and wins with inter in his 2nd year......my only concern is his track record in europe but at least he can go through the group stage
Ole has died by his sword
Ole and the coaches out
😱😱😱
It's tense at united, I'm suddenly unsure about tottenham
Please keep him 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Spurs aint a easy game because they are better coach team then us they are more a unity and all the teams we played this season played better then us so am scared because we could lost again
Good luck for harry kane and son It’s the best opportunity for them and also for conte
Supporting cr7 and united stand
Ole out  Erik ten hag in
OLE OUT SON FINISH THE JOB
He’s not going to go they are waiting for him to hopefully beat Tottenham then hope everyone forgets noway get this fraud out now
skysports saying fans clapping at the end of the game may have indicated to glazers that we are still on ole's side... this club is so frustrating right now
Oles style of football is called "scrabble counter attack"  Basically you just make it up as you go along and hope you get points .     Klopp chess master  Tuchel chess master  Pep chess master   VS  ole connect 4  beginner.
What is shocking is we a first club after such a heavy lost to have fans being ok with manager and actually attacking others for being hurt and want change
Moment reports of Donny + Pogba came out about leaving United if Ole stayed, Solksjær was a dead man walking bc United stay "elite" via player evaluations.  Pogba would've had assurances b4 IG post = am Conte update. Not a coincidence.
Glazers OUT. Absolute embarrassment on how they handle our club. No one is bigger than the club.
I am a United supporter but this Weekend I’m supporting spurs to win so OLE can go!
De gea should be captain most senior player at the club
No Mike! Ole will stay! Ole In! 💙
Ole’s stubbornness has got him to where he is. I think the Tottenham game is a form of giving Ole a chance to bid farewell to the fans.
The glaziers are hardly going to attend any of the games they know they are not welcome and would get dogs abuse.
Honestly I want Sinisa Mihajlovic to replace Ole despite his mediocre stint at AC Milan.
When r u doing ep 21 in career mode
If Star Wars was Man Utd: - Joel Glazer: Emperor Palpatine - Man Utd: The Empire - Ole: Darth Vader - Ed Woodward: Grand Moff Tarkin - Coaching staffs: Imperial officers - The fans: Rebels
United stand drivel
I think Pogba still needs to leave United regardless of if a new manager takes over or not.
The sad truth is i am not exited anymore even if we win against spurs. We all know win or lose, its a lost cause. Ole will never ever rebuilt our club. OGS need to go!
As a club, I think it's high time we move on from ex players and the past. These people believe their word is law because we have given them relevance. Let's appreciate what they've done and then focus on the progress of the club in general without their input. Every other big club in the world does that, can't understand why it doesn't happen at United.
Ollie is a spare wheel
If it's any consolation Mark I think every British player at the club is seriously overrated too, especially Shaw and Maguire.
It’s time for the fans to voice our thoughts. Ole and his team need to go. Thanks for having us in a better position but you’ve taken us as far as you can.
If you like woke nonsense, marks your guy! 👍🏿
Ole has to go, he’s just not good enough to be the manager of Man U we need an experienced manager!!!
I'd love to see Forgie come back from retirement and take charge until end of the season
Wow... Absolutely brilliant!! Your appraisal on the xenophobia at MU and the media is spot-on. Thanks for having the courage to say it. Sky Sports and MU are hypocrites. They talk about diversity and "taking the knee" yet they engage in, and perpetuate discriminatory behaviour everyday. I see it all the time. Every word you have said is exactly right. The overseas players are constantly being criticised. The one time Maguire was criticised, Jamie Rednapp said people shouldn't do it because it may damage his mental health. Don't they think all the constant criticism of Paul Pogba may be damaging his mental health. He's probably had negativity all his life.  Your comments should be clipped and shared with every news outlet, especially Sky, as the only true and genuine representation of diversity that's been spoken about football in the media!  Total respect to you, Sir!
Your board includes Alex Ferguson who had a lot of influence on the decisions
He must leave
I used to like Ole but he has proved that he’s not an honourable man. Clinging to a job he knows is lost. Look what Gattuso did when he left Milan. That is what a decent person would do
Just leave the stadium half empty from the start of the match, then they will know how f**king serious the fans are
Ole out
Ole say we are nearly there.... Yes he is right we are nearing relegation...
Ole will fight back.
If ole stays this season then we might aswell look for another club to support so the stadium becomes empty 🤣
The players are going to play for themselves and not for ole in the upcoming matches as there is definitely a rift between some players and ole in the dressing room
Fergie wants Pottechino,I don't think they want Conte which is disappointing. We need to  modernise our club for heaven's sake! Oh and Pogba, if newspapers are printing untruths you can always sue them can't you?
we must demonstration at old Trafford . riot is the best way for this club
Cardiff reject at the wheels .  Another 10years without titles or trophies in the making with Clueless Ole. Epl top teams and their fans will very happy the Cardiff reject still at the wheels. Gary Neville should make ole Shelford manager if he likes ole or daring enough to do that.
Respect to Ole but if he loves this club he resigns or the board should really be serious. All this is stressing the fans out and some of the players
I don"t have a good feeling about Conte.. he is overly aggressive in his philosophy.. i'd like to see other options
OGS formations are often wrong and he tends to play players out of position.
pls dont u toxic fans ever disparage SAF name.
When was the last time you went a game Mark? Always on the Internet as I see it leaching from the club.
Losing 5-0 at home to our biggest rivals and the horrendous start to the season doesn't result in sacking of a Manchester United manager. WOW We better change our name to Sheffield United then
It’s over for United. Watch arsenal finish above you
It's done for Ole. Please just go. If he stays, he might just become a villain.
Ole out
The fact that SAF had to go to the training ground shows how weak Ole is
He's definitely winning those games and staying ffs.
Ole is de best
what are they clinging onto? he needs to go
Ole out!! We can’t continue like this anymore
That got woke quick, damn
21 HAG
