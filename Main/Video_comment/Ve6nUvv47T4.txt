2025 and I just had to 🙌🏿😤
BRO REALLY IS GOING CRAZY ON THIS ONE one time I thought I was in a dream 0:22 BUT I was in a nightmare I couldn’t move at all. My head was twisted and I thought I was dead, but I was OK. It’s crazy how all the pedophiles are out there RIP two little kids that died by them that it is so crazy Dax you still be making good music🔥🔥❤🏆
This came out while I was in 11th Grade now I'm in university doing my last year and these lyrics make so much sense now it's no longer just a song I can vibe on
Pray to the cross I can save everyone
Wow your lyrics are on another level brother...love n light to you and yours  my brother 🙏
I don't know what to say Dax😮..... But keep up the good work coz I can really relate with this song❤
This is revealing
You don't need to be famous. Get a house, get a car, learn how to cook, clean, and repair. Get your basic needs met. The rest doesn't even matter
https://youtu.be/Eaqb0qeOOeY
Fame comes to those who sell there soul just to have it   , and never think of the consequences that comes with it  !!!!!!!!! .
this a masterpiece for those who looking for fame, be careful what you wish for❤
This was stupid dope
🩷💚
This is STILL my FAVOURITE DAX song
Dax and Eminem need to make a album
Gotham isn’t just a place. Its a mindstate watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow… bombshell..
In Gotham 🫵🗣️🦜🦍🍉🪓
Amen and AMEN 🙌🙏
Is he talking about Jesse Michael Taylor
Dax your my favorite artist and this is one of my favorite songs by you
Chained Im the broken link  Setting you free Praise the misfits

Klipnya selalu memukau ❤
I’m from Chicago and live in Chicago   I love Gotham 😈🃏🩷
I’ve been anti-v*olent but don't push me cause I just might do it
2025
Love that Linkin Park is continuing to live on! Rock on 🤘. I was like 11 when I heard Hybrid Theory and my life changed that day. I even had giant blue spikes. They wouldn’t even let me go into the school with them when we moved. Made me feel more isolated and oppressed as an individual. LP music got me through them years 💯
Would you please come to Zambia please

For real
Dax is one of the greats. This song proves it.
1:03 because you have a blue check. 💙 Don't mean you're anybody. You can buy it nowadays.
U see me am a Muslim but your lines in lyrics make me stick on Allah coz I understand we are moderate nigas different from others God bless you with the work what you do
❤Wow wow wow!!❤
❤❤❤
Damn Dax got a mean uppercut
Who came back for inspiration in 2024
The Asylum produces the Plans.
We was waiting for that plot at the end 🔥
This should be double platinum
For people who don't know, he sings about HOLLYWOOD! Los Angeles where zombies chace money and fame.
what you expect when dumb people got smartphones... 🫡
They're not tryna build theirs, they're tryna take yours 😢  Those lines... 2:25
This is deep. Gotham is the greed for fame, power, and money.
Is JOKER, JOKER RETURNS,Why So Serious?, and GOTHAM like a miniseries?
I don't need to be famous but I'm known in spirit
At the very end though
I mean ugh
Uhh
TIMELESS
2024 and this song still pure fire! Truth in every fckin bar! PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE THIS IN THEIR TOP 10 FOR ETERNITY

This is a good song.   I referred to it a couple years ago.  And I'll keep listening to it every time I have them thoughts. Four years sober drugs and alcohol as of  9 14 24   four years.  It's been a hard road but I'm doing it ❤🙏💯💪
Batman Gothom🎉❤

No body is from here but everybody comes here

From Egypt.... Thanks Dax❤ i love it
When life gets real ive heard enough to know your right people will wish your words touched them like a pedophile. Theyll wish they remembered these words.
Fire 🔥 📛 👨‍🚒 🚒 🧯 🎆
I can't wait until Batman's training makes this outlaw too funny for the devil to hide.
The Caribbean people is all for you  hun❤❤❤❤❤❤
Remember Pulling a Skywalker is short hand for trying to murder your apprentice in his sleep
Daxx is a fucking hero 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 he’s green lantern surely idk
We need to remember the reality
I need back stage tickets tmrw dax
Lol everyone wants that
My dad hates your music and thinks i only listen to it to spite him like you aren’t a good artist or something like the music isn’t worth listening to or something
I love this song.
I think dax is a DC fan
You're killing it! Wow! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 You're such an amazing rapper!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
My boy
Love the updated video
I don’t want to be famous but I do want to be someone people can go listen to to keep going
Real facts especially in state that want to be recognized as sanctuary City's
Marvle needs to call dax
What you expect when dumb people get smart phones
I give it for free so anybody can take it
DAX is for Geniuses, not for those who think they are amongst the geniuses.. though the whole world thinks that..
My favorite asshole. I’m right there with you, Dax
That deep
This is easily one of dax best songs❤
I love this song so much a lot of things you said is so true i love this song so much i love a lot of your songs but so just freak me out
The piano nosie in the background 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
America's Gotham 😢😢

🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️
What do you expect when dumb people got smart phones.That line reminds of Proverb 11.22 "Like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion..." Keep doing you Dax
touched me this one bro
What do you mean by real fake and we say fakes real my ideas people who have schizophrenia say that certain things about people and we say that they're lying in their capping what if they're not lying what if that's real and then what if these people who live these things online they say their life is real but it's really not because they make more money off of it and they're living a fake fantasy but it's really based off of someone else it's scripted
Respect brother
This hits harder than Batman beating up a jaywalker 😂💯💯🔥
My interpretation of what *"Gotham"* means, is a code word for *"The Industry"*   If you know, you know...  I believe that's what he's saying in this message.   0:45 - 0:58 Exactly. 💯👀  0:59 - 1:35 / 1:55  - 2:48  These are the type of messages that makes you *"Die of natural causes"* if you know, you know. 🤫  Keep it up Dax. You're a real one prayers to you 🇵🇷🙏💯✝️🔥
You probably terrified of me doing season greetings 40 days 40 nights boss degree ❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 joker assian 😮😮😮😮😅😅
I'm going to call the Batman looking character   dark x
Wow❤
We live in a broken Gotham 😂 but Dax is literally non-brainwashed Batman
Música Top demais!
Fallen from atop of a moutain  They say know matter who you are you can make it in a world like this. Cant remember what its like to make it . I guess cause i havent yet .  Fallen from atop of a moutain  They say its all a game . Gotta keep quiet dont want the media to understand how people use people to gain popularity.  Fallen from a top of a moutain  Lost my mind in a soul searching theme . Never believed . The day i was told . Was the day i will never forget .  Fallen from atop of a moutain I was in another world in a place being somebody else not believen the truth i was told . Why would you tell someone before the murder .  Fallen from atop of a moutain.
Hollywood is Gotham!
1 year 2 3,4 and still in this job
I know the line is "Gotham, livin' in, Gotham, livin' in..." But is it messed up that I always sing it as "And God don't live in it, God don't live in it..."?   After everything he describes and depicts, it seems like the best lyric. But I'm not an artist, so I don't want to sound like I'm criticizing because the song is genius all around. And when I say "genius," I am not being flippant with words. This song is actually genius.
"When dumb people have smartphones" my God this hits hard,this explain a lot...oh wait....that's only one verse and I dont wanna explain the rest cuz I dont have the words by my side rn...I'm not DAX
I'm old now and life got real
I lothe that fight scene
Wow! Lyrics speak volumes. Amazing !!
Honestly love to see u as the batman. Honestly
Finally, some meaningful rap, after Tupac Thank you for your existence!❤🎉
The song is about Hollywood, nit batman.. Thank you for your work Dax!
First time watching the music video, dad makes the best music videos, whole ass movies
Musical Lyrical masterpiece 🔥💯👍
Gotham is probably  is aka Hollywood

Only some will understand what ur saying. It isn't about Gotham. Names. Superheros. It's a schooling inside a tested time frame. Everyone has an audience based on what they create for you. And you make
Lost souls
Everything that he has song here I feel like hes taking every word out of my mind
It was such an honor to meet you.  NEVER CHANGE..LISTEN TO THOSE VOICES.   ITS ANGELS.  I  KNOW.I HEAR THEM TOO..

W SONG
The dax rises I can just see the billboards
dax is my legend for life
i would like to see a adaptation of batman with him as joker and china as harley.
Man the meaning behind these words are crazy and the fact that most won't actually get what he's speaking about is sad bro great song keep going your blessed
I wonder if people see what I did there??? I tie everything together
One of the best songs by dax ❤
Listened to this song I know over 100x. A true masterpiece.
um I don't like or agree with the message but i respect you Dax. The music itself is banger and i love the hooks. No hate my brother just wanted to share my opinion :D. also i love what you did with the whole batman theme. So cool. God bless you :).
I have no desire to be famous. I'd rather DAX become so famous that no one will not know him. He's a great and talented person, in all he does.
This song needs to be in a batman movie weather its animated or not. I would lose my mind, find it again just to lose it one more time.
I’m late but this is my new favourite son❤
I had my mom who hates rap of any kind listen to this and now she can't stop listening to dax!
I hear ye + sound energy psa119:155-142 יהוה בן יהוה  loves ye and So do ii  😅 all-progress is progress It’s the Most Highs’ will to believe in whom The Almighty’s sent.  ♾️Thanks 🙏
Been folowwing you awile now. Womdering why i never saw this until.now🙄
Perfect
GOD forgive me. I misunderstood you in the past. I told people what was untrue about you. Dax please forgive me, I was wrong about you.
finally black batman
Dax thanks for going hard, your the Batman in Gotham. Real life
How am only watching it today goddd
This song is underrated
I miss this one favorite
Call me crazy but this guy makes a much better batman than robert pattinson 😂♥️
You're an insanely god rapper
That's crazy how he exposed them
You know my dad jesse
Love this song! Please perform this on your upcoming 2023 Chicago  concert!!! Love you Dax! See you soon! ✝️🙏
Dax is the anti-matrix
He's trying to wake focus up so that way they don't get lost in the matrix become a Karen or just an ass. Cause u can lose your soul in this place
Only Truth can over power the wicked. It probably scares the "hell" out of them. Ha
Hey Dax  Just saw you with Tom Mac and now I'm listening to you. I'm a 60 yrs. Old "white" lol. Love it. Blessings
This is my opinion, we should atleast once come together and try to be human keeping everything aside,just be human for one month the whole earth,time for new beginings,and for sure we will all be free.💯
This song is a goddamn reality check
Dax, Gotham NEEDS a sequel. Lift this up, I know he'll see it even if he can't respond
What you all don't realize this man is speaking the truth and he's using a cartoon to express a biblical solid evidential truth this is what is wrong with our nation this nation is so asleep in regards to spiritual warfare in this man is trying to show you what happens, any is honestly being 110 percent truthful in what he's saying
Escape the matrix
Dax is on another level followers won’t understand his song leaders recognize the truth and understand this song it’s all facts
Notice how the powerful music is? And the elite make it get less views. Shame.
Awesome this is so great!!
This really isn't about Gotham
I love this. It's true... So sad
“What did you expect when dumb folks got smart phones?” What a truth teller you are, Dax!
Still in my Gotham
Check mate
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
IS THAT THE GIRL FROM AMP SQUAD
I said this already on the "Joker" songs but Dre- Batman Eminem- Robin Dax- Joker NF- Two Face Hopsin- Scarecrow
Hey dax.. i know you're overwhelmed and hurting and have a lot going on in your own life. I will never be upset if you dont see this but i want you to know your music has saved me from suicide in more ways than i could ever descibe. I am not liking your videos as one of the blind masses, i am thumbs upping your videos because i love you and each and every person out here who is putting there all in and getting nothing back. You are not a puppet for our entertainment, you are trying to open our eyes to all the deceit and you are showing us we are not alone. I hope you will be one of our leaders when we finally challenge our government, big PHARMA, and the FDA with the herd mentalitly we have been forced into.
❤🐐
This is pOp
What I like is that your music is all about you and your life your circumstances and how you feel you're not interested in Fame you're just interested in expressing yourself if people like it then great and if people don't like it O well...
I will chase my fears and embrace them so I may make it. I been at the bottom with nothing to show for, so when I become famous I will be unstoppable however never at the cost of someone else's fame, I made it this far and I can't stop now.
nice dax ❤
I listen to Dax but wow he always seems to surprise me has a way with words and voice 👌❤
Absolutely love this song!!! Although I can't watch ur video tho... I'm disappointed that you used a whitewashed version of the Lord instead of using an ACTUAL Israelite..
He's the shit
Your Words in every Song are the TRUTH❤🙏❤️
I saw this live in September 2021, so dope
Woe to those who call evil good and good evil. who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. Isaiah 5:20  Dax, I have a story to tell and I’d like you to tell it. If you like it, it’s yours but if not just tell me how much. I believe you’ll truly want it.   Death, come, and yet I remain not,  for life eternal exists in the ALL;  only an obstacle, I in the pathway,  quick to be conquered by the infinite light.  Awaken, O flame that burns ever inward,  flame forth and conquer the veil of the night 🙏❤️🤫
In New York
I think Dax is a huge fan of Batman but anyway I think he is one of the greatest if not the greatest. Your amazing man thanks for staying with it I really enjoy your music and your not just a rapper your an amazing country singer.
You are a real one
🔥🔥🔥🔥
U want some cheese with that wine?
Man, i low-key missed this era of dax man. I was never so excited to listen to anything until dax was giving us banger after banger, his recent songs are cool, idk just don't feel the same. Maybe it's just me though. But all love and support man, just felt like i had to voice my opinion.

I want meet you DAX 🤜🏼🤛🏼 u rap what I meditate
This is incredible.
Who doesn't want to dress up like Splatman/Batman.  I only say Splatman because I'm more of Superman fan. I just can't be fan of Batman because his dislike for Superman. Only for 2 reasons 1st he's not Human  which is a shitty reason. And because he doesn't feel physical pain. But Bruce knows Superman would be Human and was in comics and movie Superman 2. However he realized he can't be Human give up his abilities because of otherworldly threats Doomsday,  Zod,  Darkseid! The Justice League and even Batman agreed some threats are to great for Justice League without Superman.

why is it everyone had that child molesting pastor. me it was back when I was 10 when I first started going then kept going to be there for my friends. while that fucking pastor molested 2 boys one boy died but the other is still alive now he's 19 living a good life after he left the church. the other boy was shot by a corrupt cop back in 2018. I still miss him to this day and this is actually the first I've talked about this but your music is one of the reasons I'm still here

Blind people leading blind people to there cars while the destination on clear and you can't stear..... gotta be about the ev's right?... put in your destination let it drive you what makes the people blind is they believe they are doing good for the world but the batteries are horrible and the charging stations are ran by diesel generators... worst of both world
You're good dax is 1fst
Whos still here
I love this song so damn much the lyrics are so flawless
💯 Truth! Every time DAX 👏👏👏
You think dax dropped that $8 for that checkmark?
Crazy how I went from watching Demonic videos to this
This is deep my g
I just blasted a hater. Weird folks.
And Batman really only wanna be me
The devil is in here bro, u are good but you have a left side and this one is mixed with the devil's feelings and thoughts!
"won't give me know Credit-- cuz they know they gon Use it" .. (no Coincidence)..
And again we grow
Life (.)  Physicality isn't that Grand.
👍
Gotta love how hard Dax goes with his music videos. Some next level choreography right here 🙌
🤭🤩😛🥰
Dude I want to be so famous that I live my legecy
Messina
Come to South Africa 🙏
8 million views, congratulations
My Gotham? Homeless in Atlanta, Georgia. What about yours?
Gotham=The Industry/United States
Hands down Dax’s best song imo
✴️
♋
Too bad all the superheroes ended up being brain dead
How did they just ask the people of that building Dax: Aye can we use this building for an explosion? People who own the building: Sure?
I think Dax would be the best batman in the world. Or is it just me?
I have to become famous
You are right
not a justification .
I can relate
So true
I know it isn't good becoming famous but....I have to try...I want to become the best movie maker...and actor, I want to help the homeless
wait a minute?? HAVE TWO UIASHUSHAUSHS
You are no og
hey dax reply if you see this plz i was wondering  will you do one with NF
Polo
The vampire bat, the unholy feminine that has possessed humanity, Lilith
🔥🔥🔥 This is a vibe!
DAX SAVING ME ONE BAR AT A TIME ❤
I heard this song in passing once and didn't stop to think what the song was about...it's brilliant. There are things people know are true and can't put into words and when you finally hear it spoken it's just so true.
This is Soo true MONA, do you think you can do it..YES, she isn't nothing like them and they don't do it right because the are used to it the wrong way. They aren't queens behive, they are in the hive not the outside in the figure it out Mona
okay guys, this is just a hunch, but I *think* Dax really likes Batman.
up
I can sit a listen this guy for days. His song I can relate to a lot of them and they have a positive impact
So now that I have fully listened to 1. Joker 2. joker returns 3. why so serious 4. Gotham  I can say Dax is more than what is obvious. His understanding of how each core DC character is grey (neither white nor black) shows knowledge that is not from a superficial place.  I have listened to all the 'dears' and covers too... you know what you're doing D. Big Ups, don't stop!!
I be shaking when I write my music. I felt that. ❤
باغات
I don't wanna say ALfredo Pacino . No Roman walker
So which one is it... uber or lyft
can i use yo music in my streams?
gotham is a place where the best actions taken a subtle maybe you should be more careful catch my drift
My only problem is i do not recall ever thinking and manifesting where I'm at in life.
Not. Never!
2:30 reminds me of Alexander Hamilton. In a good way.
I'm finna listen to this before I watch Gotham on HBO.
His music does hit different some older people when they realize the reality
I'm late to the name for that I'm sorry happy black history month keep being great!❤️💯🔥
1:42 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼, 🔥🔥🔥, ❤️❤️❤️
0:52 🧿🧿🧿, ❤️❤️❤️, 🖤🖤🖤
🔥🔥🔥, 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼, ✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼
The end reminds me of the music video "Cool Guys Don't Look at Explosions". 😄
One of his best songs
I'm glad my friend told me about Dax. His music has helped me through my hardest times. I hope im not the only once that's been touched by Daxs lyrics
If you're hurting, remember that Batman *just* became Superman in the comics. It's time for the servants to be a masters. We just needed to learn to be humble by suffering. And we've done it. You've done it. Don't stop.
I hope one day I get to meet DAX. Such a nice guy ☺️
We need tom.mcdonald and Dax collab asap
I really dunno why buh this song makes me freak out like the world is entirely a lie…buh I’m glad you touched areas deep enough not to drown in
Brother from another mother
Real shit true like a mother fuck wish it wasn’t only person who get me
I don't want to be famous  Wanna live a peaceful and private life  Much love from Ghana Dax
Cute to see humans grow in self awareness
This joint still hits 2 years later
It currently says I’m watching Gotham, another great song, but it’s “My Heart Hurts” currently playing lol
lol, you aint blowin up cause you woke holms. "Who aint blowin up?! Im gold with no label!" k, I say again, you aint blowin up cause you woke. You're talented and if you can just rap about anything but politics you are gonna go really far. Rap about your dog. How he sees people and loves to eat. Rap about Aliens and their impression of the earth. Rap about Anime and why your favorite one is the best. Politics is gonna get you lonely. Eminem didn't survive his TDS and you won't either bruh. I love ya.
"...Gotham is not a place it's a mind state..." Nice.
dam....love this guy
dax is the GOAT idgaf what anyone says
2023 anyone?
If ur reading this dax I was once told "you have the fame. Why dont to take the power and fourtone?" "I never wanted the fame i only wanted to bring peace" Another person once told me " fame eill only bring u pain, missery and anger." He easnt wrong ❤ respect dax for trying to open others eyes
The thing that I remembered after Andrew Tate got arrested and Kanye West got canceled.
This is the best song from dax for real 😭😭😭
Reeemix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMKhFYg9PfY
Good advice needed bad advice taken
If that's what happens when the master starts fearin the student then I have ALL of completely fucking terrified 🤣😅 and I don't even have to try.
Dax sucks
I just discovered Dax. Damn how good his music/lyrics are. Amazing. Is he a new-school rapper? Iam old-school hip hop fan, thats why Ive never heard of him. Now Iam fan of his music. :) PS! New 2Pac?
I'm gonna name my first son Gotham so when my wife wakes me in the middle of the night and says Gotham needs you I will feel like batman
seriously did as well as the magicians in Hollywood.
Nobody’s from here…..😢
Is dax singing the chorus too? If he is then daaaammmnnn
We all want to be like Batman, but we don't know the responsibilities of that, thanks for showing us that.
YYYOOO!!! WHAT THE FUCK DID HE JUST SAY?!?! I LOVE THIS GUY! DO YOU HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING??
I really really want to be famous
I really love the whole show including the outfit ❤️❤️
Kicking
Truth 💔 Hurts
🎶
Everybody wants fame they dont care whats it for that's some real shit
the joker was my favourite actor in Gotham as it looks to Dax side😃
Remember cut and copy just beat the delete took over it's place and put it child with the numbers  don't worry the zero and one can tell us who feel and grow
Two years later, this song more real
Dax....real superhero....that's facts
2:26 !!!
isnt that blonde girl on the left from dhar mann
Clip no soo can do better But song No.1
Now, many artists are saying the truth about Hollywierd.
rectangle
Gotham sucks bro
Dax is already the best rapper period he took real and obliterated the multi billion dollar sellout industry. Hell Hollywood wish they could stop the truth he spit but it seems like everytime they try got busts they lips and say keep your evil off my kids. Fuck it bro keep being dax and destroy the industry every time we do evil we hurt God but everytime we are good we hurt the devils. So dax from one brother to another show these demons what happens when they fuck with our family!
Please bring back this Dax...the Wack ass rappers typa Dax 😭😭😭
Fire
I wanna be a fast rapper like  you i love your music and can you put my name in the next release. GORDON
This is fire Dax
DAMN THIS GUY IS SOMTHING ELS. WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
True Goat. He is describing blue cities to a T
Hard to listen to you Dax without getting emotional 😢
I see lexnour too 😂😂😂
I'm assume this song is about cancel culture and the people on Twitter
True talent right here
Bro this guy make me cry thanks dax preach brooo
On fire🔥🔥🔥
Może być
i used to say if someone made me famous they could keep 70% of the cash until i learned what those creeps are all about.
The end guy be like, " hi vsuace Michele here"
He said the everything is plastic when he stood Infront of the two ladies 😅
One day im going to rap with you dax
Great video and lyrics speak to My heart dax youve always been a great artist
WOW 😳😳😳 JUST WOW 😳 🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰

This song is underrated
Facts
Sounds like a metaphor  for the industry
Hey look where Im at again🤣. This song speaks so much volume now bro. Had to get right for a while. Ppreciate the wisdom in this song bro. Much love. Shalom🙏🏿❤️

#BringBackGothamNetfilx
“Everybody know everybody if you got a blue check you ain’t anybody reboot repeat sleep top suit keep copy” The best bar
Coming back to this man whenever I need to relapse from listening to this hours after it came out im young asl and your music has taught me a lot
Fuc**** love you man,
This song has such a strong message bro
That girl on the left in the pink, she’s familiar
One of Dax's best songs for me and for "some reason" it doesn't gets pushed to the top? Probably speaking some hard truths huh. Keep up the good work man! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dax is a fan for Batman is not my opinion is a fact right dax😏😏
Me to be famous is not my thing,i want to be just to me and besides what is the point of been famous if you will not hve your own free time, serious dax you're famous in this community of my all my friends from home, from school and church there know you. You're a legend 👏👏💗💓. Do you even have a little time for your self. If you don't mind me asking. 🤔
Like my pops told me is that us young adults are to busy tryna to get. Accepted into the world instead of being ourselves we always wanna be like others and forget who we are us as young adults n teens we use internet for dum reasons and we never use it to to better ourselves but we use it for others be side that me personally I don’t ever wanna become famous I just wanna inspire and motivate people to always push your to self to do what you love don’t do things that your not gonna enjoy do things what you enjoy and love don’t worry about what others have to say about things you do don’t ever let other people tell you something you can’t do
Great Song

I missed you Dax.. been a year.. you're still one of the greatest, and this will forever be one of the greatest tracks ever!  Your music is being blasted in Egypt bro! Keep shining!
Hollywood is Gotham.  I love this take.
Charity, giving batman few more year, by promoting
hmmm..... I'm a shipper for about $300 a month, I have a honda scooter and live in a small rented house Why you ask?
Gotham= LA &/ Hollywood (kinda most of Cali in my opinion). The modern day Sodom and Gomorrah! Lol
LOL I wonder what's batmans secret identity, does anyone else know what rapper where's his hair in the shape of a 👑
WOW!!!! Man all I could keep saying was just wow. Man you are BRILLIANT. Thank you for blessing us with this song & your music. Good to see someone spreading the truth with some power in this industry.
omfg i can't be stop listening 😭😭
I wish dax stay safe this lyrics is so deep that could put you in danger bro
"Ain't got to prove nothing to no one they done nothing for me." I felt that line as it hits so close to home.  Glad ive outgrown so many fakes and started getting myself out the mud🖤💛 Much love as always Dax hope you're doing good homie 💯 #LivingInGotham
Realest
Reminds me of heathens all my friends are heathens take it slo
I created a monster that they will never pay for mistakes
DJ SoSo Sorrow & DJ D~Llamas ft Dax - Murder The Rich
Not finna cap dax be looking fresh as the new bat man frrr tho
I love the part when you put that valid blue check that is soooo true nobody gives a fuck about you until your famous.
“Don’t tell them how you feel, because they won’t call back” that lyric hit
Dax your music is so relatable
What if you take the word Gotham out and replace it with America then listen to the song
This song is so True on a deep level 💯💯💯💯
Holy shit this song never gets old 🥲😈🖤🎶
this video gave me chills. "Save yourself" that all i got from this..... DAMN!!!
Dax don't ever stop speaking truth and what is going on. Don't let them silence you like so many others!!
Who's Robin? 😁 ... Good sound 👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾
I'm I know how to u a smart face
Dax. Keeps it real raw.   God is love and strength. Life is worth making a stand for your neighbors, friends and family.    Sim u late al gor it hym...   Create  J He can build it in a day She is to be praised  Our  Lady God bless the USA
I am also in Gotham - in my case it is Kampala; the options "befriend/take money/backstab" absolutely killed it cuz that is how it is in every Gotham of this world.
Doggy dogggggg!!!!!!🌭😂hummhumm sausage party .
Also I hope you passed your green card test DAX❣️💋
In Bowen, in Bowen, living in Bowen, living in Bowen
Dax! I see you! Stay true man. And alive Love your artistic message! ❤️
And we just stop for a moment and respect how this man always does everything within his power to preach the message of God and wake people upeople up to how evil industries can be but does it in such an entertaining way But you can't help but love his music like granted I haven't listened to that much I'd like listen to I'd say white listen to I say 15 songs But I love them all and they're really catchy Someone like him legitimately  Is a legend in the making It's only a matter of time before he gets a call do a collaborative with Eminem I'm just saying But I digress this Man deals with depression and what he is doing with his time is trying to help people through theirs God-bless this man
This shit goes so hard broo
i love your music bro
4.44m
I listened to this song when it first came out and liked it cause i thought it was catchy. A year has passed and now i like this song because its relatable and spits nothing but facts 💯
The fun fact that dex blows up when a new batman movie is about made is funny 😂  you gotta love change sometimes whoop whoop mcl
Wow Melody like heaven,,,the chorus,,,hot🔥🔥
Lv Dax ,, always speaking facts,,,,do another hit with Nasty C and Khaligraph
Gotham Joker Joker returns and Why so serious ands a holy quad of songs everyone needs to hear
when good is used for evil to destroy life how should one love when only hate refuert and one only receives injustice oneself does why split in half or be a copy i cry out for pain or maybe i have no voice anymore
Nha he wanted a paycheck big enough for a bat-mobile
This was the song that got me to focus on me and stop caring about others more than myself. Had to fix me to help fix others. Thank you my dude.
Yo dax I love your video’s
To borrow a comment from below that says it all in one word MASTERPIECE
I love Batman
Being famous isn’t great why for a few bucks  give it away to the poor so we can all be blessed and have peace here on earth there is no reason a kid should ever go to bed hungry nor anyone for that same thought no I say let’s meet as 1 and say thank you lord now I have to show this in this lil but if flow you already know I had to show you and DAX you already know I stand with you not against you stay true to you and GOD stay up much love …K.A.S
Let's be real! He is real! And that's one attribute that people of this world has lost. Keep it up Brother! One thing I can't stand is Fake people and Fake situations. 👍😁✌️

Bumpin this truth in hicktown Montana stay true homosapians ✌️
Fire! 🔥
Listen to the words inbetweeen the lines .....those words can fill the biggest book
I think that we're headed down the wrong road (I swear) Fake's real and they say real's fake woke (you see this?) False prophets on these screens everywhere we go But what did you expect when dumb people got smartphones? More memes, cool, make it all a big joke Crown your fake kings and let them sit up on your fake thrones You're young now but just wait 'til you grow old When life gets real you'll remember all these words I wrote I went roaming, walked multiple ways For forty nights, forty sleeps, yes multiple days (I tried) In the desert, no food, water, searching for the answers But you listen to these people who got nothin' to say (you wouldn't listen) You wouldn't know real if it slapped you right in the face Ain't for the culture, I can tell by the shit you embrace (I see it) I'm in Gotham but my mind's in a different place So fuck your co-signs, money, and your radio play I be shaking when I write my music I've been anti-violent but don't push me 'Cause I just might do it (don't push me) They won't give you no credit 'cause they know you'll use it And that's what happens when the master Starts fearing the student (they learn) In this city you're a number They don't see you as human (they don't see) Just a puppet they replace for their games and amusement In a city full of angels with the biggest influence I see demons with a platform who just fucking abuse it In Gotham Everybody knows everybody (everybody) If you ain't got a blue check you ain't anybody (fuck) Redo, repeat, sleep, double tap, see copy Lost souls unaware they're turning into dead zombies (zombies) Everywhere you look is plastic, all fabricated Everything you've seen on TV was exaggerated (it's so fake) Don't nobody see you 'til you get a million Followers and when you do they treat you Like you're someone and you're validated What do you do? How much money you make? Who do you know? What do you drive? Where do you stay? (Where do you stay?) And while you're answering those questions They'll be calculating how much of it They can see themselves trying to come in and take If you're fragile don't you even try Come to this place (don't come here) They gon' build you just to break you, then rebuild you to break Let you reach your own limit then heroically save And that's exactly how Gotham turns you into a slave In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your minds in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose Their souls 'cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Nobody's from here But everybody comes here Wanting to be famous 'Til they realize the price of fame Brings close everything that they once feared Consumed by the algorithm, it becomes clear Life's a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer Blind people leading blind people driving cars To a destination that is unclear while they can't steer One year, two years, three years, four Drugs, alcohol, addiction, morgue Fake friends, women gold-digging as a sport Who convinces you, you should live a whole life you can't afford Nobody sees you, you're continuously ignored Everybody wants fame, they don't care what it's for They don't wanna build theirs They're just tryna take yours This is dog eat dog in this messed up world You think you need this place but you don't Happiness is not a physical place you call home Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel? When you take that time away from your phone Fake shit goes viral, we know this won't They'll say they care but will never show Gotham isn't just a place, it's a mind state Watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your minds in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Don't tell 'em how you feel 'cause I promise they won't call back Everybody's in it for money, so it's all bad Killing off my demons, I'm rapping this in all black I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta Prove nothing to Gotham They ain't done nothing for me, for me
Ay keep doing u fax love ur music
this is a great excuse to say "i''m batman" all day
Dax catch me when you go live again...
Anybody ever wanted to know why Bruce Wayne just spent all of his dead parents money on expensive gadgets and cool bat costumes,I mean he’s just a rich buff middle aged man beating up robbers
I literally binged every single song just now and I’m obsessed😭😭❤️❤️
Speechless 😶🔥💯☑️
Yo every song is a banger
I ❤️this it's unfortunately so much true every city in the world looks like dax Gotham 😭😭
Am I the only one realising this Dad is Batman and beating up the jokers but dad is now a joker, saying that he’s getting beaten up by…well…everyone
“In the city full of angels” we know where Gotham is
As a lifelong batman and rap fan I'm extremely proud to admit the two go well together
Thanks for the goosebumps
this shit sucks 😂
Uhhhhhh.....this sound+ video.......so strong impact....RESPECT!
Robin
i love how u went from bat man to joker #be the hero u will see urself as the villain #Phenix jones the realist/if u only sold weed id look up to u
for a little i thought this was about internet. Still works but love the song going to be a classic when people stop looking up to the wrong things.
Yes, yes, yes 🙌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿❤️❤️❤️
The bars are so real here in so many ways. Keep spitting truth, keep speaking your mind and heart. Brighter note, you definitely got them hands I see. 😆
Okay Jason Todd would sing this song
#PastorBatman #BrightDarkness #BrilliantKnights💜🇺🇲🔥😈💯

every day i find one of your songs and i fall in love with it
So real
We r living in gotham💯💯💯
Thiss song onn fireee 💯💥🔥
I should be a star, Rock super star... I fear the fam and wealth... I can imagine, by myself the world and I could stay as is... Some say I'm a waist of time, I'm fully alive. If you could understand, maybe I'll try sharing ones more.but don't thing it is a good idea... It's best this way... All I had to say
I listen to all your songs     that are going to songs bro
This song is basically a warning. People who want to become famous sell their souls to the Illuminati. Because they have spiritual influences that can rope in thousands of countless people into listening and following them. As if it's like following a religion.  Those artists and actors who have millions of views aren't just from physical and talented influences, it's spiritual influences too sadly. Why do you think so many celebrities end up with drug addictions, have been to jail, have known to have sex with anyone bc they felt like it, and have mental health issues? Because they have realized this lifestyle that so many people idolize and worship isn't worth paying the price for. And that is their soul and how they live their life. They are basically, as Dax described it, "a puppet for the puppeteer(Lucifer) to use for evil intentions". And in the end, "when the puppet breaks, the puppeteer(Lucifer) throws it away". As if they never existed. Why do you think in the K-pop industry so many fans are obsessed with just a person? Or a couple of people? It's not normal to be undeniably obsessed with someone just because they are hot. There's nothing wrong with a celebrity crush, but that type of obsession shows they are something satanic (at least in my opinion) influencing it. Please people be careful around these celebrities today. I honestly don't know if they are human anymore from what I've discovered. But, hopefully, these people will stand up for themselves and get out of the lifestyle, or they might die trying. I do not think these people are our friends, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't pray for them. And people please be careful what type of music, movies, or just entertainment you let in your life bc they either have good or bad influences. And to be honest, if you really think about it, you discover the meanings of these words.  Entertainment: "Enter" in your life-"Tain" taint the innocent-"Ment" Take up every moment. Television: Tell-a-Vision Other Definitions that really show the truth: "delight"- in good or bad "distraction,"-to keep you away from goals and achievements "diversion,"- to divide people from loving and respecting each other "pleasure,"- to enjoy the pleasures of the flesh (porn which creates addictions, NSFW ASMR, fanfiction, books, tv shows like Euphoria and Riverdale, etc.) "recreation." is the action or process of creating something again. To change something or someone completely.   If yall want more evidence I recommend DuckDuckgo.com bc they haven't filtered through this kind of stuff, but I'm telling y'all, if y'all don't believe me, that is completely fine. But if you are interested, I will warn you, once you learn the truth, you will be wiser, but some things may never look the same again. Just ask God for guidance, and if you are not a believer, just ask for him to help you. He will listen. I promise you. All you have to do is ask 😊😉 God bless you, friend. We are all in this together.
When you think of it.. Gotham is a fucked up city.. Gotham is literally the epidemy of idloizing people who deep down are just pieces of utter trash ( aka Harvey dent or two face).. He was crowned Gotham's hero despite his actions just after he was put under stress.. And then low and behold.. Batman shows up.. He's doing the right things in a wrong way.. Which is more fucked up because that's against the law.. And even more fucked up because he's framed as the bad guy... But it's not fucked up because it's the right thing to do.. See where I'm going here? It's pretty clear to me through the line of super intendent "Not the hero we want.. But the hero we need".. Proving just how much shit is in this city that its own laws can't protect it but a vigilante can
There needs to be more songs relating to the same thing there just needs to be more people like dax and they need to try to prove the same point as dax
It's a shame that he has to conform to the system.  How he is in Hollywood now a shame how many he could have been God's gift instead of devils instrument.
OMG! DAX you are a legend to rap all those lyrics! Now that is some Real Talk my buddy...expose all the evil $hit in the world just in One song :) ,you really can be placed alongside  Pac,Em and all the other kings! Fuck the Industry! WE ARE THE LABEL!
El gato!
Dax might have like an actual career in maybe like action films or superhero films.
The test of the creator is to not sell, your soul is your consciousness, dont SELL.... be better.
Liven in Gotham can't no body stop him tall as the towers feeling the power of every soul I rap for feeling so sore  life pain till I'm number to the floor so graciously feeling better from the pleasure of the schedules leaks prepare to see meeeeeee lose my mind every time I bouce back to the real world can't stand it so I stand out can't count me out paaa
Famous naw i dont want to be famous but i want to  change the small towns in new mexico.  Starting with the city that my two sons live in espanola nm  they have no homeless shelters no one  residence for elderly they need. To have a rather huge change like .. its bad there and since i cant afford a lawyer to help me get them back  right away then i was to get non profits or make a non profit  anything to because those kids out there all they know is prison and drugs  feom a small age. My dad was from there and he left and didnt take us there to ever do anything ...    He died of a drug over dose in july of  1999   wow  another year almost ... But really  i       would not like attention             the money id use for  good and if the things i have gone through would help someone   id be famous just for them. Yada mean?
By now you have tracks some people will say is old. Music just ages it doesnt go bad. Ill appreciate your art and listen to these lyrics of yours through the ages.

Nice song Dax! It makes to think about your life.Well done one more time!❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥🧨🎆
Dax is so underrated. If they only knew ,or listened, instead of thinking about talking we would all flow.
The root chakra of the world..LA California.  If you know..you know. This shi deep Dax.
I think that we're headed down the wrong road (I swear) Fake's real and they say real's fake woke (you see this?) False prophets on these screens everywhere we go But what did you expect when dumb people got smartphones? More memes, cool, make it all a big joke Crown your fake kings and let them sit up on your fake thrones You're young now but just wait 'til you grow old When life gets real you'll remember all these words I wrote  I went roaming, walked multiple ways For forty nights, forty sleeps, yes multiple days (I tried) In the desert, no food, water, searching for the answers But you listen to these people who got nothin' to say (you wouldn't listen) You wouldn't know real if it slapped you right in the face Ain't for the culture, I can tell by the shit you embrace (I see it) I'm in Gotham but my mind's in a different place So fuck your co-signs, money, and your radio play  I be shaking when I write my music I've been anti-violent but don't push me 'Cause I just might do it (don't push me) They won't give you no credit 'cause they know you'll use it And that's what happens when the master Starts fearing the student (they learn)  In this city you're a number They don't see you as human (they don't see) Just a puppet they replace for their games and amusement In a city full of angels with the biggest influence I see demons with a platform who just fucking abuse it  In Gotham Everybody knows everybody (everybody) If you ain't got a blue check you ain't anybody (fuck) Redo, repeat, sleep, double tap, see copy Lost souls unaware they're turning into dead zombies (zombies) Everywhere you look is plastic, all fabricated Everything you've seen on TV was exaggerated (it's so fake) Don't nobody see you 'til you get a million Followers and when you do they treat you Like you're someone and you're validated  What do you do? How much money you make? Who do you know? What do you drive? Where do you stay? (Where do you stay?) And while you're answering those questions They'll be calculating how much of it They can see themselves trying to come in and take  If you're fragile don't you even try Come to this place (don't come here) They gon' build you just to break you, then rebuild you to break Let you reach your own limit then heroically save And that's exactly how Gotham turns you into a slave  In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your minds in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose Their souls 'cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Nobody's from here But everybody comes here Wanting to be famous 'Til they realize the price of fame Brings close everything that they once feared Consumed by the algorithm, it becomes clear Life's a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer Blind people leading blind people driving cars To a destination that is unclear while they can't steer  One year, two years, three years, four Drugs, alcohol, addiction, morgue Fake friends, women gold-digging as a sport Who convinces you, you should live a whole life you can't afford Nobody sees you, you're continuously ignored Everybody wants fame, they don't care what it's for They don't wanna build theirs They're just tryna take yours This is dog eat dog in this messed up world  You think you need this place but you don't Happiness is not a physical place you call home Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel? When you take that time away from your phone Fake shit goes viral, we know this won't They'll say they care but will never show Gotham isn't just a place, it's a mind state Watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow  In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your minds in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Don't tell 'em how you feel 'cause I promise they won't call back Everybody's in it for money, so it's all bad Killing off my demons, I'm rapping this in all black I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta  Prove nothing to Gotham They ain't done nothing for me, for me
Good shit brother! im a new fan!

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥man this song was powerful
Check my lasted video ❤️🔥
Watching since last year
This is definitely hollywood.
I don't want to be famous only stupid people want their name known sorry dax. But as soon as you gain fame the big guys come in controlling you for your followers. People don't understand followers have been around for years that's all celebs gather. Followers. Another part of control. Just like money & religion
At 1:15 the girl on the left acts in some dhar man vids
It's dax!!!
Dax just loves bieng the undcover hero, whilst at the surface hes the villian. Hes just telling us this, in joker, joker and gotham. Gotham address' that everyone is good till try over achieve their dream, turning bitter and hating people that they could of been.
You are the best dax
You and Eminem need to do a video together.. How badly do you want to be famous? You really overdid yourself. ) I am loving it..✊✊✊✊☯️ That's deep
This song is Badass
Dax goes hard on each track
Had 2 free style a Harley Quinn reaction 2 this. This song is soooo dope omfgg

Most likely I get blocked by YouTube and you continue life without seeing these
Hope you pray at night
Make it all a big joke. Dax

🔥🔥🔥
Holy shit this I good.
Relativity in music has been gone with them rappers rapping about money unattainable women,cars etc but this song in particular reminds me that true  musical artists still exists.
If u listen this masterpiece in 2022 u are a Legend!!!
This was amazing. This represents exactly what the world has become. The world is horrible and filled with terrible people, it always has, but it's never been this bad. Especially with cancel culture. It's nice to know that there's still people who keep it real.
WHY AM i JUST FINDING THING GUY....ANGRY AT MUSIC INDUSTRY...YALL MFKS NEED TO GET YA SHIT TOGETHER OR DO I?
Love 💘 it mm
He really a living legend 🔥
That feeling when you go back to an old song cause you relate
The only person who can save you is yourself

Hail the lord repent before it’s to late and heaven is funner because hell isn’t gonna be a party the devil rapes burns you in lava they stab you and I’m only ten but still repent before it’s to late amen
Hes talking about hollywood
I got fkin 29 subs bruh I feel like this is the prefect time to plug 😂😂
Literally just figured about him 15 minutes and he’s my new favorite rapper.
Its daxman! 😂
Sometimes, your music is just too much bro.   I’m sorry.   I’m in a really sad place right now and even though I want to listen I can’t.  My best friends mom just died and everything is just hitting so much harder right now.   I’m crying my eyes out harder than I ever have listening to this music and I’ve never heard it this way before and I’ve listened to your songs 100’s if not 1000’s of times.   Life is so crazy, man.  I pray for you every day bro.  To find the peace that comes from faith in Baptism so you can reach your absolute potential.  And really, that’s just what I want for you Kus it’s what I think you want.   But, Abba knows, bro.   Just trust Him.   Thank Him.   Love Him.  He loves you.   He loves us all so much.  It’s that simple, for me.  Thank Him for Jesus, so His light may be a beacon of hope after our own darkest night begins a new dawn.  Amen.  Thank you, Dax.   This music has so much emotion.   And a way to bring some of those out you may not want or think about needing to deal with.   Each song, a little miracle!
Yo from tik tok. Dude. Please dont change. Keep speaking truth
My name is daxton and I hope you notice me because  your my fav rapper but I know you won’t reply but it’s my 2022 dream to be noticed by you
Shit I don’t want to be famous I get cancelled right away just for making a joke
Dax is the best singer in all your song you tell the truth
Damn!!!  How come Dax has never grabbed a.... Hmm lemme keep mute. A full album sense in just one song. 🇬🇭😍
LA?💭
Dax is now my favourite artist. I feel you are the best story teller out there.... this hit the soul
Love it
Unimaginable brother I believe with you
dax i love the message you say i feel like your with me  in this world of stuck lost souls
Wait...are you telling me "GOTHAM" is pronounced "Gatom"?! O.O
My favourite Dax song till this day
Dax is a better looking batman than any we have ever had looking swag
you are truly awesome my guy
You are 🔥
OMG THE GIRL IN THE LEFT IS IN DGAR MANN
When dumb people got smarts hit different
You already are famous 6.3m views
I want round 2 of Dax and Tom Macdonald.
Can Dax,    after he raps.... put his slacks in the back of a sack, with his knick knacks, grab a snack of cracker Jack's, sit back!  like the Mac, smoke a stack, to avoid the attack, (this time it's manic so no need to panic)  take some time to relax, cuz if you don't, your on  track, to a heart attack and it's time you'll never get back- so do what u do!!!     just take a break!!! you've a lot more to do and this is my message to you as I sit on the potty and poo.
I just want to get past my head.   It stops me.   i won't be satisfied or ok until I get off my ass and give back and help.  It's hard enough to break out of my own mind and sadness let alone try to save others.  I think I can get there-and if I CAN....I can do a lot of good. or life will pass me and it will be too late.
Music and message is magnificent brother, I couldn't agree more with everything said while vibing to this nasty ass beat! You ever come to mid FL hmu bro we should chill, love to listen to what you got to say
This had better action than The Matrix Resurrection
EVERY SONG YOU MAKE HITS HARD BRO
I tried to show my mom and sister this and they called it demonic when we only watched up to 0:21 how you gonna say something demonic if the video started and they said it’s because of the thumbnail that don’t make sense
Not really being famous is that cool
❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🥺🥺
Damn this touched my soul,🖤
SIIIIIICCCCKKKKKKK🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The joker here is better then the one in suicide squad....
DC should make Dax a cannon rapper from Gotham
Like your cut g
I've been anti violence but don't push me coz I just might do it.
This song deep
2:49 ابو صلعااااااا
Batman hahahhahahahahahahhahahahh
How is it every real rapper has recognized and collaborated with you except Eminem and krizz kaliko?
id take being a great person and man over being famous anyday but the money would help
i dont want to be famous the money would be cool but honestly being famous when your an introvert with mental health issues seems like it wouldnt be worth it and when did the world become so stereotypical and materialistic
I mean people joke about problems to escape them so memes are just a way of expression really
The suite tight tho Mask could use some work
This deserves 100M+ views like what... So much truth in one song. Incredible.
.
I like the fact that Dax is both Joker and Batman… and dax… when u think about it maybe Bruce is the joker in his insanity!
Wtf👏🏻
FROM TIK TOK
Form TikTok
✨FOR REAL ✨💯💯💯💯💯💯
TIK TOK Love what you do and I thank you for not being a fake🙏speak truth through music is how it should be💯

Great song😎
Let's see if you're still listening to this masterpiece 10years Later
"I think that we’re headed down the wrong road Fakes real and they say real’s fake woke False prophets on these screens everywhere we go But what did you expected when dumb people got smart phones" - > This is just GENIUS! Thank you DAX! You made my day :D

Its daxxxxxxxxx
i don't want to be famous. i just wanna live by myself, on my own little shelf of the world. or something as small as a piece of coral. i speak this oral-ly. not comically, it's the way i speak. i rap i defeat i try to spit but i always weap that i dont have the power speak or spit or flick some heat. this is a rap that won't get a piece of the pie, i'll do what i wan't till i die for every day i cry i spiritualize and eliminate the demons inside. FOR REAL
👑👑👑🙏

Bro, where is your lyrics come from...so so hard❣️❣️
🤔mmm did they hear this??
LYRICS:  I think that we’re headed down the wrong road Fakes real and they say real’s fake woke False prophets on these screens everywhere we go But what did you expected when dumb people got smart phones More memes cool make it all a big joke Crown your fake kings and let them sit up on your fake thrones You’re young now but just wait until you grow old When life gets real you’ll remember all these words I wrote I went roaming walked multiple ways For 40 nights 40 sleeps yes multiple days In the dessert no food water searching for the answers but you listen to these people who got nothing to say You wouldn’t know real if it slapped you right in the face Ain’t for the culture I can tell by the sh*t you embrace I’m in Gotham but my minds in a different place So F*ck your co-signs, money, and your radio play I be shaking when I write my music I’ve been anti-v*olent but don't push me cause I just might do it They won’t give you no credit cause they know you’ll use it And that’s what happens when the master starts fearing the student In this city you’re a number they don’t see you as human Just a puppet they replace for their games and amusement In a city full of angels with the biggest influence I see demons with a platform who just fucking abuse it  In Gotham..  Everybody knows everybody if you ain’t got a blue check you Ain’t anybody Redo, repeat, sleep, double tap, see copy Lost souls unaware they’re turning into dead zombies Everywhere you look is plastic all fabricated Everything you’ve seen on tv was exaggerated. Don’t nobody see you till you get a million followers and when you do they treat you like you’re someone and you’re validated What do you do? How much money you make? Who do you know? What do you drive? Where do you stay? And while you’re answering those questions They’ll be calculating how much of it they can see themselves trying to come in and take If you’re fragile don’t you even try come to this place They gon' build you just to break you then rebuild you to break Let you reach your own limit then heroically save and that’s exactly how Gotham turns you into a slave  In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose they’re souls cause they can’t control in Gotham Everyone lies it’s an eye for an eye you will lose your mind in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls cause they can’t control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Nobodies from here But everybody come here Wanting to be famous till they realize the price of fame brings close everything that they once feared Consumed by the algorithm it becomes clear life’s a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer blind people leading blind people driving cars to a destination that is unclear while they can’t steer 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 Drugs alcohol addiction morgue Fake friends women gold digging as a sport who convince you, you should live a whole life you can’t afford Nobody sees you, you’re continuously ignored Everybody wants fame they don’t care what it’s for They don’t wanna build theirs, They’re just tryna take yours This is dog eat dog in this messed up world  You think you need this place but you don’t Happiness is not a physical place you call home Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel when you take that time away from your phone Fake shit goes viral we know this won’t They’ll say they care but will never show Gotham isn’t just a place it’s a mind state Watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow  In Gotham Everyone goes And they lose they’re souls cause they can’t control in Gotham Everyone lies it’s an eye for an eye you will lose your mind in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls cause they can’t control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Don’t Tell them how you feel cause I promise they won’t call back Everybodies in it for money so it’s all bad Killing off my demons I’m rapping this in all black I ain’t gotta I ain’t gotta I ain’t gotta I ain’t gotta Prove nothing to Gotham they ain’t done nothing for me... for me
Wow  Dax
Bro you sit and listen to Dax's lyrics and this shit can bring a tear to your eye, man...
Who’s still listening to this masterpiece ❗️❗️🔥🔥
This song deserves a Grammy
Just finding out how old Dax is like?? So much wisdom and inspiration at such a young age. He's such a gem ❤️
The best masterpiece I've ever heard
Still playing this. So good and so true. Very good camerawork and lyrics as always. It's always a pleasure to see your work and how you pour yourself into this.
Can't we just be real not Gotham? its this world this system. let them cry for peace and security sudden destruction will be instantly upon them. Because there peace and security is fake.
i like that ur not like the other rappers that only talk about them being rich, doing drugs and getting girls, INSTEAD u talk about not giving up and whats going on in the world. thank u brotha
bro I have been obsessed with this song resently and seeing this video makes me love it even more.
why is this not in a batman movie.
omg its BlackMan!! :D (dope song bro)
⚡⚡⚡
Your music is beautiful
All of you some freaks worshipping lucifer.  This video tells everything.  You are so sick
This will always be my top favorite in this entire hell of a world.
This song hits the heart. I'm 20 and I've been living in vegas since I was 7 and at only 20 I've lost too many fucking friends to drugs to gangs, people I saw myself growing old with didn't even make it to voting age, people I've known since they were innocent little kids growing up too fast the fucking government taking advantage of vulnerable people, vulnerable people taking advantage of each other just to prove they're not weak and by stooping to that level they lose themselves. I'm watching everything I love fade away and it's bullshit. We're all angry but most of us are victims of circumstance just stuck here so either you live the way you have to to get through or you die there is no in between and everyone is looking for an escape and people prey on that every day. I've seen so many people become ghosts of themselves, it's worse to say bye to people that are still here, when all you can do is accept that they're not coming back and just let go. Give up all hopes and control. And try not to let it tear you apart. Because if you become weak you'll be next. Try to be strong, you know how terrifying it is watching my siblings get older in this world that fucking preys on kids, trying to guide them and tell them they don't have to be a part of that life feeling like the world's biggest hypocrite because I'm not consumed by money like most of the people in this world but this is their world and I have to do what I have to do to provide. Hoping my heart will be enough to keep me from losing track of what's important, and my dreams will drive me enough to keep going even when all I want is to give in. This song makes me feel like I'm not the only one in their world who doesn't want to be here. Idk if you'll see this but thank you
Ok, dax, You a rap god, but joker, You got him a bit wrong
Love this song
I heard this once from my cousin and can’t stop listening to it now
Nice!!!!!
I feel attacked. But he is right
Every song Dax does has a message… now this is rap
Art
This is fact man, nobody don't care unless you got some hard hands man! It's like describing the LA, Mumbai, Dubai and a lot more cities.
Man I remember when this first came out it does not feel like a year
Is Gotham a symbol of Cali or the media?
Bro, all of your lyrics are wisdom. I repeated some of the parts of this song just to listen to the bars.
I feel the message here is you need to be able to save yourself
coming back to this song, these lyrics are actually really smart and well crafted
Gotham still schools me✊
Your raps are awesome but your singing voice is amazing.
This is terrible. Don’t quit your day jobs.
Hots hard makes me rethink life choices
dax is someone that kept coming across my playlist that i didn't think id enjoy, i hate to admit id skip all the time. and then one day i heard demigod go off, and now dax is an addiction i have and i regret not knowing of him soon. definitely can tell he pours himself into his music even thought it might not be something everyone likes.
Это просто прекрасно ты тот, кого я искал
俺これ大好き
BatDax Hell yea!!!
Hey man , i did a drum cover for this amazing song  It would mean a world to me , if you saw it 🙏🙏🤘🤘
Daxman
Always come back to this song. You're a true original, Dax, thanks for all your music.
2021..still listening to Gotham..🥰
So Fire!!🔥🔥🔥
Nobody wanna be famous
Well I'm a fan. Love that you feat with Tom MacDonald. Great work. You really give me hope for humanity
I guess I'm not everyone, cuz money ain't shit, but freedom is, so if I have to create war and kill the wanna be Thor, than be prepared you messed with the wrong whore.  Jason and Freddie ain't got nothing on this white chic. My crazies been brewing for some time now Just like the Joker said I'm Gotham on the talk show Bam Bam You get what you deserve From the monster you created Shot through the head, and your to blame, darling you  made my love into a dark thing. Ha ha ha ha BOO HOO life isn't fair
best Dax song
9 out of 10
This song has a message 👌 love it
i love finding more of your songs. This is probably my favorite. i’m in love with the lessons you teach. Come to ATL. i wanna see you <3
Amazing metaphor. Best lyrics of this century. One of the best artist of the awakening. Gotham is matrix. Matrix is falling down... Save your souls and let the new dawn rising.
Hi Dax your awesome
Damn my guy....... you're good.......dude never misses
Was it awesome getting to wear a batman suit?
i swear Dax your music is real and i sharing to others in Australia 💯💞
Love you from Italy 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
I've been shaking when I'm writing my music👐
1:25 is my favorite part
40 days 40 nights
Im a mucian not as good as this guy
“Let you reach your own limit, then heroically save.” Bruh not many people know what this means but, I do and for years I always told people to be careful for the people watching you.   Like traplore Ross joining No jumper after building up a huge platform, which only gave no jumper the chance to say “Heeyy join my team?”   And he does, now he can never surpass No Jumper without being apart of No Jumper.   They got em.
:(   lloydminster truth gets covered up at our own citizens expense
Batdax new favorite superhero
Damn DAX talk about being real, got my respect real quick with the few I've heard you on , so nice to hear real truth being spit
Thats  Denver
I love the DC themes because DC has so much more meaning than just batman and superman you know but people don't take the time to look and understand and solve the mysterys
Love the opening line, very powerful and moving.. "I think we are heading down the wrong roads, fakes real and they say reals fake woke, false prophets on these screens everywhere we go but what did you expect when dumb people got smart phones? More memes, cool, make it all a big joke, crown your fake kings and let them sit upon their fake thrones.. Your young now but just wait until you get old, when life gets real, you'll remember all these words I wrote"..... Damn
Thanx GOAT 🐐🙏🏽 🇿🇦 #DAX TOLD ME TO COME HERE FOR KNOWLEDGE 🔥💯🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
I’m so happy I found his music from TikTok, I’ve never related to music so much as I do to all of his music. He’s so underrated tho✋🏽😩

“What do you expect when dumb people got smartphones” I love Dax so much because he talks about real shit instead of most rappers that brag about there jewelry and “bitches” they get
💯💯🔥🔥
I have been involved in things that had the attention of the country, and I avoid the notarity. Life isn't about fame for me. Great song 👍
👁   👁👃👁        👄 Damn didn't work. 😆
💥💥💥💥💥💥💯💯💯💯❤❤❤❤❤
I came from lexnour
Fame comes at a price and can only be bought by those who can see the truth
I'm in Gotham but my mind's in a different place 🙊🙊😱😱
To be honest, I don't want to be famous. I want to have enough to live and keep from being bored. Shit's crazy when you start getting that fame. Everyone wants to steal from you even your name. The only use i'd have for famous is the opportunity to meet you. I'd want to talk to you and us to engage and realize we are more or less the same. You are my brother from another universe and i am yours. In a different lifetime, you were Loki. I was Baldur. You gave me a pet dragon that i take with me each time I'm reincarnated. You're a madman, but you are my brother. You didn't kill me, but i got to know Death. I spent some time learning. It took a long time but the memories are coming back to me now piece by piece. I want those memories. I want what's mine to come back. Maybe in this world we don't connect and that's ok. I'm still proud like a brother should be. This outer shell i'm wearing is nothing but camouflage for the truth because most people ain't ready for it. We're gods. Our parents, our bloodline is mostly gone. From what i know, it's just you and me and our many reincarnations.
Damn dax a man of god.just like me atlist we have him 🤲🤲🤲 god is real.
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
That makes 4 Batman related songs... i can tell this guy's a fan. (I just Discovered Dax yesterday.)
Dax is warning us about the real world how you'll go mad trying to be something your not don't let social media reshape you into something that will destroy you
I can relate. I relate to a lot of your songs. I rather listen to u then anybody else
🙏🏻
...and yes, I can see him making a SERIOUS Batman!
....there's always a limit to patience, a limit to passivity, a border that should never be crossed...it's a shame...but seemingly necessary
I want you to know if you havent read it that: Nurgle Matthew's hero was always: Joker Ruling Gotham. THANKS DAX 🔥🖤
Getting kick ass vibes! Fucking awesome man! 🥰
i swear Dax makes fire and relatable music
Fuck fame Im the prophet of blame Looking for people thatre the same  Wanted a teacher But i may be the master Chase a beat, and think faster Im gods bastard The prodigal son will return at 30 12821 so symetrical Turn the 8 on its side Ill live to infinity In famous aminimity No one can judge the sin in me Theres no such thing as original sin There is just the origin of sin
#Dax❤️👊
Perfection. Bit, lyrics, style, singing. Damn. Im glad I kept listening to you, every track drops hard. Gotham is the one I go back to with love
This just explains los angeles
Eye  4 an eye

I think real did just slap me in the face people are obsessed with social media
😘🥰💖💜
They treat u like ur valid if I have a blue check 😢 swear dax when it time comes I will represent you all the time and I will blast this song wit my windows down
Dax drops facts after facts, this song has been on repeat on my phone for the last 7 months, there is not even once i dont get goosebumps when i play this song.. i’ve been showing Gotham and a couple other songs from Dax to all my friends but they cant understand, cant relate and thats why Dax is sooo underrated which is sad but also understandable he will forever stand out, not only for being real to the core but also for that burning passion he has  Hats off to u Dax 💪🔥 u have our full support and admiration Much Love❤️
I want to be famous soccer player like Ronaldo and messi
245K views as of today. Your tribe found you anyway. As they always will.
I told my friends to listen Dax music  now he is     big fan of Dax
i love this song so much, you rlly helped me through a tough time as well, thanks
Legendary child of God
u also call him lyrical monster
This banger hits in 13 diffrent spots and I'm a swede
This song is amazing dude, I had never really heard you before and this changed that dramatically.
Damn bro keep it up…
Damn I forgot how well and true this song is
"Don't tell how you feel cuz I promise they won't call back" that shit hit so close damn close to home for me
I believe he is talking about Hollywood and the mindless drone who is in a trance at is splendor but like the song hotel California you can check any time but can never leave
Had to come back to hear this was feeling down but this helped alot! Thanks Dax
WOW, this could be said about my city...NASHVILLE, TN!
https://youtu.be/gkDD_WCzl10
I think Gotham might be an idea. But i do understand the song and what Hollywood is doing
if only tech wasn't invented i mean i like to us it but it is making so many props
The song is all true story
lol its DAX
Great message in this song Dax! Also love the DC imagery in your songs.
How don't u have the same clout as Em... in my eyes no one will ever out write u, I love u dax
People who lives in internet thinks that they are happy but they are not!
Classsssssssssssss AF
POV: you're gonna be the only one he doesn't heart
This is fire you outdid your self 🔥🔥
I need a Batman vs Joker from Dax now.... Yes I know the song is called Gotham but still.
I listen to your music all the time, so picture my amazement when I tell my kid to put on some music while we clean and he throws on a Dax Playlist. #DadGoals
“You ever wonder why u feel how u feel when you take away that phone?”🤔
You are living my visions! Good work #Dax
This video convinced me to subscribe :) Keep up the good Work!
This sounds very macklemore, i think my favorite from you.
Gotham isn't a place its a mindstate. Beautifully said bratha.
Got-ham
I love your music
Ur exactly right but like I said before were not of this world for the world hated the Lord Jesus Christ and crucified him.and being believers of Jesus Christ they will hate you to. I am not like anyone my age I'm 25 I never tweeted or whatever only Facebook ever once in a while. Believe in Jesus Christ and don't care bout things of this world for this world will pass but u will have everlasting life thru Jesus Christ
With all the DC songs this guy makes, you know he's a real fan.
DAX
Goat😀😀
Feel like this is Cali

He is actually good no doubt
Dax is sent by God to defend himself in the world ruled by illuminati
I don't understand the song? Can someone explain?
I think you should make a song about Robin ☠️☠️☠️ like Jason Todd
He is one of those people were you can actually hear what he is saying
My guy was born with the lyrical limitationsFrom God this man was built to share truths no lies all fax’s it’s crazy how some people will do so much just to be valid people really need to listen to yourMusic keep up the great work man

The rap that got Dax famous
Living in " Gotham "
Hey Dax, love the song, the lyrics are crazy very deep, but it lacked energy don’t know if that’s what you were going for but that my take on it
Alcoholic addition morg Fake Friends Women Gold Digging damn!!!! That's intense!!!
What do u expect when dumb people got smart phones!!!! Damn!! Dax!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your music is fire and you actually take the time to reply and like everyone's comments. Stand up dude bro! Respect
If i were famous i would keep my face secret to have privacy
Dax is amazing, there aren't many talented rappers with a message these days and he is one of the best. Just started listening to him a few weeks ago and he just blows me away everytime. Keep up the good work Dax!
Gotham isnt a place its a mind state, Got that NY state of mind. i love nas and if thats a shout out to him god damn.
Mannnn I wish these song got more loveeee
Hey Dax I was suggested by YouTube & Spotify about your music.  Started listening last night watching the sky explode in completely darkness.  I'm listening now,  hearing you,  and understanding what you're saying.  I understand thinks like pain and being fine with it.  Others aren't always like me.  But thank you,  and congratulations on Dax for what it's worth.
My full breakdown and analysis of Joker, Gotham, Joker Returns are available on my channel

The first time I heard this song from my woman, I thought he was say gato...... I was thinking what about a cat. Lol
DAX, you made me cry in the book of revelations. I found you today, I have my masters exam but i cant stop listening to you. Love from India.
This is one of my favorite songs ever haha the video is wild as well.
Lifes a simulation controlled by a puppeteer
That singing tho
Also I love your lyrics it's extremely inspiring good job.
Do another song with Tom macdonald I swear you both are gonna be number one together
I dont know why but when you are really hurt you feel all DAX songs
🔥
You play the puppet well. Keep helping the powers that lead us, lead us.
This series of songs really helped me dax you speak so much truth it hits so much harder than this shitty mumble rap that’s around keep showing what a lyricist does ❤️🔥
Who else got here from the HI…. In “why so serious?”
Dax🔥🔥
Maybe its just me but I want more BatDAX! #"I'm BatDAX"

No one like you Daxxx you are damn unbeatable ❤️🔥
Same the things that I don’t want to be famous because if you do one tiny thing you have the whole internet coming after you

Just a moment but I need some help Dax and this song says something to me I need your advice?
Rewind nd chill ppl
Rap God give them this link  🎆🐙🎇
Haha Gotham is New York in a parallel dimension
Favorite rapper #Dax
DAX. THANK YOU. You make my soul scream at myself and others. I appreciate your sincerity. I can only imagine some of the nights when you're writing and probably crying. Because people degress and everyone continuously becomes more desensitized. I see the toll in myself. Your honesty gives me goosebumps and makes me question myself. Your music clarifies that I'm not alone and aware. I just started listening through your music a week ago. Please stay you. I appreciate you. Thank you for being you because I correlate to your music so fucking much. DAX, drill people back to reality, compassion, and truth. Not glorified hollywood and the ancient concept of the American dream. Fucking grind
My favorite Dax song 💯
Technology is a tool and a weapon and the same time. Future is risin soon. Just think about it, Apple, Samsung, NASA, Pentagon, Blackrock, FBI, CIA, and the Worldwide system. Enter the Matrix and we all get controlled by fooles that understand nothing. Ya'll will call me an Alien that seeing things others doesn't but I'm just a Human livin Humanity. We should be proud and change the future and not live apart from another. We R all One. This is called the meaning of life, the existance as it self.   ♡
💖💖💖🇮🇳
Hard🔥🔥🔥💯💯
Wasgood DAX
My favorite rapper for sure. Imagine the temptation of selling your soul I respect you soo much brother keep producing.
ITS DAXXX
2:25 Isn’t that Omar Zaki?
“dont tell them how you feel because I promise they won't call back” I never understood that until I told my friend how I felt damn that sh*t hits.
This is so good
Joker 🎶🎶🎶✈✈✈Loves his Dad🙏💔👓🕶🗣💌👥👥👥
🕺🥋🕺👓👕🤠💡💪
Dax is genuinely one of the realist ones out there. Mad Respect
Dax has surpassed every other artist across many genres I used to listen to regularly. I still come back to this song and get goosebumps every time. Dax is a fucking legend, not only lyrically but for his constant new content and love for his fans. It doesn't get more real than that. Thank you Dax.
i feel like i can listen to your music to release pain and stress, you have real talent g.
Thank you
Hi I loveeeee your song 😻🤑
👊💜
I love you
Dax*+*  so Loved his words he gave them to you to have ever lasting love for music of God
Don't come here, i remember when this master piece came out i was really going through sad times i wanted to leave this world but hearing your music changed my thoughts especially dear god, back in 2019 i had a vision thought i was going crazy, but truly god just want's to show what must come to past, he loves us all truly in they end he needs us to know the truth, and your another soul that reminded me that there is hope somewhere out there in humanity and in God.
This is kind off what mexico looks like right now ;-;
That instrumental is 👌 beautiful
I love how this song destroys social media. So much truth in this song  I’m surprised YouTube hasn’t banned it.
Dude didn't this song get released in 2012. I saw it on a music app.
dax can u tell me how can i get out from gotham
Stop punching pitbull :D
You’re the man
I'm a white, British lad and I've been listening to your music since 'dear god'. Honestly I think ur the best rapper of all time. 'how can I take this darkness and turn it into light?' U do dax...u spill ur soul into ur lyrics. U don't just mumble rap about tits and ass. I don't know how u do it over and over again? Fresh emotional lyrics every time. Every song touch's our souls differently. I pray u never burn out.
I almost forgot to listen to the lyrics because the video was so entertaining!
L'heure de la vengeance a sonné !
Condamnation obligatoire pour tous les mauvais parents, les membres abandonnant, maltraitants,  les voleurs d'héritages, les briseurs de vies, de cœurs de psychotiques, les profiteurs, ... ! Le moment venu, Gaïa vengera tous ses enfants maltraités, négligés, affamés, réduits au silence, violés, abusés, abandonnés, incarcérés, trahis, bafoués Et elle emportera tous ces "dirigeants", ces pédophiles, ces satanistes véreux qui encouragent à tous ces actes infâmes intra familles, intra sectes et ces mauvais fonctionnaires qui refusent d'agir en conséquence de signalements ! .... elle brulera tous ceux dans le déni qui ont fermé les yeux sur tant d'injustices et qui n'ont pas su protéger leurs enfants, leurs patrimoines, leurs sœurs, leurs frères, ceux qui n'ont su préserver, respecter leurs familles et les maintenir unies !!
Dax I've got soo much respect for u my guy u are such a gd rapper u really have been gifted there has not been one song of yours that I have disliked because your very very talented
I still vibe with this song this so g hits different
According to science, 3.6k people cried so much that  when trying to press the like button, they accidentally pressed the dislike.
💥
I can’t lie this song made me cry
I really need a friend the shadows just never leave
Dax never left Bro!! He has been spitting since the jump. Just leveling  up and taking the Game by storm. Dude keeps dropping fire like every 2 weeks for last 2 years. He been doing it longer but boy has he just been is his bag for awhile now.
Dax is the best
But of course.. Don't forget Batman turned into the Joker..
Just so I can finally have my Iron Man suit that's real..
It was supposed to be like Jakie Chan's Tuxedo to Ready Player One for only me..
I never lied to you Dax.. Just told you the truth about me..
Love your music bro🔥🔥🙌
💖💖💖💖
This is fire 🔥🔥🔥
💣❤🦻
Love your music Dax. Love your dedication to the art that is rap

Cool call signal dax 🤩🤩
I really wish you could put a verified sticker on my forehead and famous like Dax.... ok Dax to be serious I don’t think you deserve the fuckin hate with the greatness that you have you helped many people through depression
I not much a fan for rap music but this song is legit
Dax We are literally connected on a different plain. You can call me J Or Hatter, id love to chat if you ever got the chance
Thank you dax.. i needed to hear that.. all that clout chasing... it's all a lie .. There's nothing out there. Money is all you need. No clout
Have you ever thought about collabing with Tom McDonald’?
ITS DAX
Somehow he makes the truth sound good
ITS DAX
U loose ur soul in Gotham = u sell ur soul for fame in LA
Gotham = LA
Brooooo this songs lit all of them even dear mom I did message you on Instagram but no reply but keep up the work my g you doing great

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Freshest realest mainstream callout in a hot sec. Classix Dax comprehensive wreckage ⚡💚💥
Wassup. I wrote you before.. I be on that motivational stuff. Higher knowledge, wisdom and understanding. I wanna talk to you about what I'm trying to do, but I need people for this. Trying to spread Love, balance, and peace. I talked to some colleges about what I'm trying to do and they say do it. My idea is to put my heart into everything I do and give back to mother nature.
Who noticed Omar zaki
Yyesssssssssssssssssssssssssssss  Teach dem kids Teach them..... I said no to fame and riches also....  Just say no Save your soul
#FREERAPDEMIGOD
Nice batman suit!
his chorus's are amazingggggggggggggggggggggggggg
Being famous means you become a target. That seems to extra for ME, and I don't care for being the richest in the world or anything like that.
Song is still good to this day, Holy cow dax you honest crushed this one it's still the reason why im not in Los Angeles.
Good information. I think the devl ............................................ and god........................................
"What did you escpect when dum people got smartphones?".... Ha ha..Right in the face.. You are a BEAST,Dax......Love You. In 20 days I am totally free from something that nearly killed me.I have done a lot of work my self. But you have helped me very much too,with your motivational music.  Thanks for saving my life.
This song really helped me out of a dark place I’m glad Dax is continuing to make music helped me out A LOT
Everything your saying is everything I just couldn’t put in words. You fr understand everything... I love that u actually look deeper in things not just take it as it is❤️
Dax is way to underrated , he's Probably the Reason I'm still alive Damn 😔
Best thing about dax is he's taken his own style and made it work unlike a lot who all try to be the next em
This is fire 🔥
This is not only a song but its a life lesson. Man this really hits deep
22,   783rd   lol
Keep it up🔥🔥 brudda💪🏽💪🏽
thank you
hes says ive been anti violent lmao killshot 2 shoots likie 8 guys in the music video
I've just been literally binge watching your music videos now after seeing dear mom😄your music is awesome❤ I don't usually listen to a lot of rap because I don't know of many decent artists, but i love your music so far💛please keep up the good work🤗
Fame isn't worth putting all my dirty laundry out there. My kids, my job, my area of living, who my friend circle is, what clothes I wear, what food I eat everyday, what tv shows I watch, how I act when out of context. These are the people you sell your soul to, and in that process you give up everything you hold dear, your privacy, your character, etc. Shit's not worth it. But some people, man...
He’s like a older brother I never had
Honestly I have plains for the future and I highkey wanna put this dude in a movie
🤔He's actually right tho
this deep and hits different eve tho it kind of sad it tells a message
suit is 100x better than travis scott's
The people you have as extras are on point.
LOVE LOVE LOVE this song :) This is on my second account! I will comment on my main account though!
One of the best song so far ❤️🔥

So relatable dax ty
Why you think they featured in the CiA film to showcase their party, gorilla outside the building when they jump out to save em Dax & Kiz code defuser
This Better be on the soundtrack to the next Batman movie
This song idea was from Patrick lykins
Was just scrolling a bunch of Dax vids while I was waiting for the dear mom vid. 5 months later, every word said is still relevant. Dax is a goat
one of the rappers who actually got something to say
The dislikes are people who would do anything to be famous.
This is the first of your songs that I ever heard. That was about 2 weeks ago. Now I'm a full fledged fan. Thank you for what you do.
Dax is now my role model 🙏🔥
Love you my brother dax
Bro this man never fails to make some badass dc related songs
Definitely seeing the message behind this. Story of my life lol
It’s definitely no coincidence that you’re my new favorite artist. I’m obsessed with Batman & comics in general. Love this!

U ok?
The West = Gotham
Wow, I don't even know what to comment 💖💖

Brilliant truth.

Jesus have mercy on anyone standing in this mans way.
Finally I found a local rapper who sound better than dax  https://youtu.be/IHuK7_X6rLs ❤️👌
I luv this nigerian rappor💪💪💪
Gotham is real
He is super fast rapper
But I’m the devil👿hahaha
Dax is just in my head. This damn game needs superheroes
This is like the perfect chorus for Francis Ngannou.  Change "in gotham" to "Ngannou, everyone goes and they lose their souls. Cus they cant control Ngannou" 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Needed to get some insight on los angeles or hollywood samething about all the famous people who go there and sell there soul to the devil for fame I don't get why would you sell your soul and go to hell just to be rich and famous it don't make any sense I'm not special no one is special but dax most of the people that like your music just like the beat or the music and I know that's not what your intent is I think but all the question and answers you give in your music I've been asking my entire life and it's nice to know there's someone like me
So Accurate about this life.
“Fake a bit go viral, this won’t” wow 😳 facts
Deep meaning this should be more out there it so many facts!!

Please never leave us!!!
Dax just needs to sign up for the movies and films, too...  😏
I watched this at 1 in the morning and I'm back at 9 am yoooo🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😰
Amazing song but I think many lose the point of the message with "gotham" have a feeling people get stuck on batman and fail to relate. Which is unfortunate.. I have no place to judge your work.. its leagues above anything I can do. Just some thoughts from the outside.
wtf bro this🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He's underrated
dope cant describe dax
Yuu got tha catchyest choruses in all yur songs bro, only recently started listening to yur songs, keep makin them tracks bruv
Dax is up there with eminem forreal man
My bro: Dax is really one of a kind... Me: absolutely, he's the 🐐

I can’t believe I haven’t left a comment on this video until now.   My bad, Dax.
This song is really good
Batmane putting bars on everybody! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✌
If u hate on this u crazy smack yourself 😂🔥
Dax went hard in this...Facts_message received!!!
this is amazing! some of the best i've heard since the 80's and 90's era.
Its dax
Shit is fire
We gotta protect Dax b4 the industry start looking for him, he's exposing everything in top tier music that's perfectly sound and pulls in attention too real problems.
Nobody is talking about the message of his Lyrics.
dax  this so good
SOOOOOOOOO LIT
Profound lyrics  Madtîng yh
Das was playing the role of jason tod the robin, when jason tod was being tortured by the joker.
Dax was playing the role of jason tod
if I was a hero I’d also wanna kick ass listening to this song
Does anyone realize that hopsin and dax only have like 3 mill subs | Ik that subs don’t really matter but it’s just kinda whack to me
If I typ in "Gotham" this is the message that should pop up right away.
Great song 👍
Always Speaking The Truth.
I just realized joker is happier than batman at least on the outside.
5mln 🔥🔥🔥
How many times had dax made a vid about bat man or joker
Dax be speaking fax, welcome back
I just want respect from my haters
5 million view's🔥🔥🔥🔥
Do u like every single comment?
Dax is a king. Possibly the GOAT.
"They don't wanna build theirs but they wanna take yours." This part right here it's a big fat fact. And when they can't take it they trying to kill for it even they're not gonna need it, they just don't want to see others happy or having what they've dream of.
I like you for you
Mr Dax I have a question for you when I ask you this what will be your opinion on it as you heard or rwad about all these rappers went famous and after a while you read about different rhings like drug over dose and etc. What really goes through your mind to me its disappointment but please dont u ser how you take your anger out on the songs and nothing stupid .i am sorry but I am wondering what went throughout your mind.
A lot of  your listeners owe Gotham a lot of pain since pain and hatred is all Gotham has done for them.
This is what music should be that makes people think where our life is going!!! Great lyrics!
Thanks bro...your songs do inspire most of us down here💯
I google most underrated guy and I see dax face
I can't get over your lyrics.  Thank god, someone that is famous is using their platform for truth.
@Dax  Found a clip of Apocalypse on tictok and was so implied to see more. I have to say , I listen to your music alot and adore your spirit. May God bless you for using your voice and talents to spread his word.  Im Definitely a fan.
Have you really liked 20k comments dax?
You so mfing dope I can smoke and listen to yo music all day
This must’ve been so fun to record the video
I really like it. No wait. I love it!!!
omg this guy is so underrated
I just started listening to your music. My 19 yr old daughter listens to you and I wanted to see what you were about. I'm absolutely blown away by your talent. Keep doing what you're doing. You don't need the evil of the music industry. Wherever you are weak is where they will infiltrate. They tried to make us think Mel Gibson was crazy. All the while he was telling everyone the truth of pure evil. You are a unique and very talented artist. I pray you great Godly success. Don't give up on our savior. He is the one true path in this life.
Big Up You #Dax Your music shakes my soul everytime🇹🇹💯
Fax,dax really this is the new world! :(
One of the best raps ❤️
This man is so underrated
Dumb people got smartphones🔥🔥🔥
Dax is my father

This is exactly why we like Dax. He is real. With each lyric
In gotham
Dax is a once in a generation talent because of his versatility he'll go and sing a love song than destroy a 16 with better wordplay than most rappers. Dax is bringing art back to rap. Fuck the mainstream scene

One of the rappers that I love for the messages and amazing lyrics continues to amaze me.
Says this song won't go viral, meanwhile has more views than subs🔥
How badly do you want to get some sleep?   Dax: but wait there's more   Tomorrow: do you know why you feel like you feel?

😭11years old name Naomi
I wish I had died Being born I’m black I’m sorry I wish I didn’t have a color because then I wouldn’t be judged
Fax has taught me so much I hope he gets famous one day
Dax has a true vision of what is wrong with this world
I listen to this song more than 50 times a day it's been on repeat for weeks!! holy fuck bro, HOLY FUCK!
I find it cool that Dax actually takes the time to read these comments. You're my favorite rapper man, good luck on your road ahead!
It's my birthday on March 14th. These lyrics are so relateable and as you grow older, the meanings are exaggerated and more emotional. Love the music Dax!!!
Is that Omar Zaki
Ayyyy , This Is Fire
I wonder if you found me on instagram yet dax , attention seeker alert haha just trying to be 1 , original just want to say congratulations on your new release it motivates me . All of your songs actually . Only if we are friends in real life I'll be proud to have you on my side brother
Yo. My homie talented. I've listened to this so much and it still makes me happy. And the chorus is just PERFECT! I always sing to it!
The older I get the more I understand The legend Heath ledgers Joker. How the world is becoming more and corrupted each day. Dax you speak alot of facts and the truth in your songs. So I thank you for being different brotha.
dad?
Thank you dad this song means so much to me
Holy shit omg so talented and so underrated
I love the Batman costume 🦇🖤
ksi is a joke if he compares to dax's music
This is so inspiring! Thank you for this piece of art!
Nigga u demmmm gud mehn
If you take the time to listen to Dax’s lyrics now everything makes sense and that’s one of the big things I like about Dax
Man this song brings back memories, I remember when I was small I dressed up like batman.
Just the song I needed to hear...Dax saved a broken guy...all the way from Africa
U know I want to b famous but I have had no friends my whole life so it would b weird to b famous but like yah
😈✨❤️
came for chess, stayed for fire
This is true
Reality Dax
Coming from Nigeria is already a wrong road,and believe me when I tell you life is already real here and I already know the words you just wrote.dax you de best
other rappers talk about shooting and other stuff like that but dax talks about real life situations and about life in his eyes and how we all think the same way in some way
Dax is the kind of rapper who opens up people's eyes to the sad and miserable reality of this world
This song is lit 🔥
dax should make a superhero movie
My new favorite rapper.. This nigga be spitting fire 🔥 Bruuuh
i feel like i just watched a better version of Batman
How are u Dax good song btw! 🔥🔥
Sound like trenton
U dont need the radio they need u my guy
Wow a passionate artist with a message. I loved Dear God can't hold the tears back, would love to see more stuff like dear God
Ayee dax if seeing this lemi tell you my guy, this song is straight up banger. I dig this energy and lyrcis. Keep going buddy
Am the only one who stoped listening to the lyrics and concerted on the action. 😂😂
Dax is another tupac respectt
Viejo has oído hablar del síndrome de altura? Es una obra chilena que describe como las personas pierden sus almas tras volverse arrogantes, me encanta como dices, estoy en Gotham pero mi mente está en otra parte
Watching Dax carry Dax at the end: In the this world sometimes you just gotta go out and save yourself.
If we create illusions for others and ourselves how would we every know if we escaped gotham it's a mindset yet it needs to be grown
DAX!YOU......
Thank u very much for this extraordinary masterpiece, man!! I perfectly understood the lyrics cause I know the existence of "Gotham-Matrix" and I really got exhausted of it. I hope people start to realize that "someone" else is leading the whole world towards the worst destination anybody could ever imagine. By the way there are also good forces that are helping the ones that deserve to live a far better life... I love you and your music, more people should be able to appreciate your amazing work P. S. I'm sorry if I made mistakes but I'm Italian lol ❤️🙏🏻
Finally a person telling behind the scenes what they actually do and destroy others life's for greed
I listen to this song everyday it really speaks facts on how the world is today 💯
You’re really talented man  thanks for such vibes
I want this song to be in the new batman movie so bad...😩
This should be in the new batman movie coming soon 🙌🙌
Ngl I would love to live in Gotham
💥🔥
Ima dc  universe fan and i gotta say gotham is really insane so coodles to u dax 👍👌🤘
Sadly it's true. People now day's never care unless if you give up your happiness to be a "Somebody" and it's just sad to see so much people going through pain just to be Appreciated :(
This song just 🔥
Even batman can become the joker.
OMG i just realized he can sing-rap!
they dont like u cuz u better than them and they dont want to listen to better people like u ur a god
English needs to make some new words cuz I cant describe how your music makes me feel🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💪
Punches Dax in stomach breaks hand 😂😂😂
I don’t want to be famous
He shows everything that’s wrong with the world that most people don’t see
Hello,  i'am from indonesian
Hi my name is James it's so it is so true
🎭🎱☠️🔱
That’s true, Gotham isn’t the place you’d want to live in.
Drip check
The new batman should use this
Really deep hidden massage very good one, when you speak the truth you we get  a lot of hate.
Dax is the definition of a lyricist that spits facts. nothing but true respect,people can relate to you because you don't just rap about it you live it
Goshhhh who are you..  I legit love your songsssss
💯💥
Underrated song💯
Dax x logic = amazing song

Underrated song
Hey Dax just wanna know if your aware of the Brave web browser, if not you should truly look into it, would love to see you verified on it!!
U should diss Tom Macdonald
When the school bus misses its turn 0:04
Yall lookin at a legend in the Makin, give it a few years, the world will catch up with dex
Out of 154 ppl who watched my channel only 2 of them subscribed to me 152 of them didn't
Great song
F*cling love this song man! Huge credit to Dax What talent man

This song is deep
Nothing but the TRUTH🔥
Sunday sitting around listening to music... Found Dax...Great day...
1'000 relat
If u wanna be famous sell ur soul it’s easy actually I don’t know I’ve never done it
Is nobody seeing that the bald guy he is fighting looks alot like the mafia boss lvl 40 ads!?
I love your music dax I wish I could see you in person
Fake Woke? I heard that right? Tom just released a song called fake woke. Hold up. What's going on?
Aye, a bop to be sure
amazing song. hits home.
How are all of his songs so amazing.... you are such an inspiration. Don't ever quit doing what  you do. Stay happy!
I remember the day this came out my big brother was playing that and i said is that dax and he was like you know him i said ofc he's great
I think that we're headed down the wrong road (I swear) Fake's real and they say real's fake woke (you see this?) False prophets on these screens everywhere we go But what did you expect when dumb people got smartphones? More memes, cool, make it all a big joke Crown your fake kings and let them sit up on your fake thrones You're young now but just wait 'til you grow old When life gets real you'll remember all these words I wrote  I went roaming, walked multiple ways For forty nights, forty sleeps, yes multiple days (I tried) In the desert, no food, water, searching for the answers But you listen to these people who got nothin' to say (you wouldn't listen) You wouldn't know real if it slapped you right in the face Ain't for the culture, I can tell by the shit you embrace (I see it) I'm in Gotham but my mind's in a different place So fuck your co-signs, money, and your radio play  I be shaking when I write my music I've been anti-violent but don't push me 'Cause I just might do it (don't push me) They won't give you no credit 'cause they know you'll use it And that's what happens when the master Starts fearing the student (they learn)  In this city you're a number They don't see you as human (they don't see) Just a puppet they replace for their games and amusement In a city full of angels with the biggest influence I see demons with a platform who just fucking abuse it  In Gotham Everybody knows everybody (everybody) If you ain't got a blue check you ain't anybody (fuck) Redo, repeat, sleep, double tap, see copy Lost souls unaware they're turning into dead zombies (zombies) Everywhere you look is plastic, all fabricated Everything you've seen on TV was exaggerated (it's so fake) Don't nobody see you 'til you get a million Followers and when you do they treat you Like you're someone and you're validated  What do you do? How much money you make? Who do you know? What do you drive? Where do you stay? (Where do you stay?) And while you're answering those questions They'll be calculating how much of it They can see themselves trying to come in and take  If you're fragile don't you even try Come to this place (don't come here) They gon' build you just to break you, then rebuild you to break Let you reach your own limit then heroically save And that's exactly how Gotham turns you into a slave  In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your minds in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose Their souls 'cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Nobody's from here But everybody comes here Wanting to be famous 'Til they realize the price of fame Brings close everything that they once feared Consumed by the algorithm, it becomes clear Life's a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer Blind people leading blind people driving cars To a destination that is unclear while they can't steer  One year, two years, three years, four Drugs, alcohol, addiction, morgue Fake friends, women gold-digging as a sport Who convinces you, you should live a whole life you can't afford Nobody sees you, you're continuously ignored Everybody wants fame, they don't care what it's for They don't wanna build theirs They're just tryna take yours This is dog eat dog in this messed up world  You think you need this place but you don't Happiness is not a physical place you call home Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel? When you take that time away from your phone Fake shit goes viral, we know this won't They'll say they care but will never show Gotham isn't just a place, it's a mind state Watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow  In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your minds in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Don't tell 'em how you feel 'cause I promise they won't call back Everybody's in it for money, so it's all bad Killing off my demons, I'm rapping this in all black I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta  Prove nothing to Gotham They ain't done nothing for me, for me
Love the lyrics
I love it 🤟
"Gotham issnt a place it's a state of mind" felt that
بتفهم عربي
It's unfortunate how much I can agree with this song. I'm a 12-year-old girl and I don't have a phone, but there are kids the same age as me thinking they will get somewhere with TikTok or whatever social media they use. I have seen a girl who is like 5 years old screaming stuff about TikTok and how much she loves it. I swear, this song is one of the only real things in the world now.
Gotham good name I get it🗣
I love how you only tell the truth, I love you dax. Keep on grinding we will eventually get what we need.... humans are humans we can't really change it but we can. Much love my man you're the reallest!
En Ghatto
Fire track 🔥
One of my favorites so far. This song goes hard. I'm in the process of writing a lot of songs from acoustic to metal. It would be awesome to have you rap some bars on a track (Whenever i get some professional sound that is) I will keep working til I'm ready.  I have some brutal riffs though. I can hear you on in my head, LOL
First 😂😂
I came across this on submithub and I immediately liked subscribed and left feedback you deserve every bit of that 4.4 million views
Dax I NEED to network with you 🙏🏼
I like DAX Music bcs I can see how the world its right now ..everyone don't care about you if you aren't famous but when u be one everything start fake friends fake love everything ...that fame comes with a price , which cost a lot
Seu feio
bro i honestly have no idea who woul;d ever hate on this guy. he is literally one of the hardest rappers and theres nothing to hate on. he spits straight facts and i guess most people just cant accept it.
Imagine if this was in the new Batman movie.
rapgod dax
My favorite Dax song would mean the world if he replied as well
i dont want to be famous  i want to be known
i think Dax is dying of how much cringe it was when he turned into a batman LOL.
This song is truly underrated, it really describes society nowadays, everyone's fake, everyone wants recognition, nobody's with you in your hard times and then when you make it they act like they were with you since day one, this Is fake love man, yo dax you really deserve more with the things you bring out
Dax speaks facts😎
Best rapper ever!!!
gotham = holly wood👹👹
⭐
goddamn man i love your videos.

I think that we're headed down the wrong road (I swear) Fake's real and they say real's fake woke (you see this?) False prophets on these screens everywhere we go But what did you expect when dumb people got smartphones? More memes, cool, make it all a big joke Crown your fake kings and let them sit up on your fake thrones You're young now but just wait 'til you grow old When life gets real you'll remember all these words I wrote I went roaming, walked multiple ways For forty nights, forty sleeps, yes multiple days (I tried) In the desert, no food, water, searching for the answers But you listen to these people who got nothin' to say (you wouldn't listen) You wouldn't know real if it slapped you right in the face Ain't for the culture, I can tell by the shit you embrace (I see it) I'm in Gotham but my mind's in a different place So fuck your co-signs, money, and your radio play I be shaking when I write my music I've been anti-violent but don't push me 'Cause I just might do it (don't push me) They won't give you no credit 'cause they know you'll use it And that's what happens when the master Starts fearing the student (they learn) In this city you're a number They don't see you as human (they don't see) Just a puppet they replace for their games and amusement In a city full of angels with the biggest influence I see demons with a platform who just fucking abuse it In Gotham Everybody knows everybody (everybody) If you ain't got a blue check you ain't anybody (fuck) Redo, repeat, sleep, double tap, see copy Lost souls unaware they're turning into dead zombies (zombies) Everywhere you look is plastic, all fabricated Everything you've seen on TV was exaggerated (it's so fake) Don't nobody see you 'til you get a million Followers and when you do they treat you Like you're someone and you're validated What do you do? How much money you make? Who do you know? What do you drive? Where do you stay? (Where do you stay?) And while you're answering those questions They'll be calculating how much of it They can see themselves trying to come in and take If you're fragile don't you even try Come to this place (don't come here) They gon' build you just to break you, then rebuild you to break Let you reach your own limit then heroically save And that's exactly how Gotham turns you into a slave In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your minds in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose Their souls 'cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Nobody's from here But everybody comes here Wanting to be famous 'Til they realize the price of fame Brings close everything that they once feared Consumed by the algorithm, it becomes clear Life's a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer Blind people leading blind people driving cars To a destination that is unclear while they can't steer One year, two years, three years, four Drugs, alcohol, addiction, morgue Fake friends, women gold-digging as a sport Who convinces you, you should live a whole life you can't afford Nobody sees you, you're continuously ignored Everybody wants fame, they don't care what it's for They don't wanna build theirs They're just tryna take yours This is dog eat dog in this messed up world You think you need this place but you don't Happiness is not a physical place you call home Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel? When you take that time away from your phone Fake shit goes viral, we know this won't They'll say they care but will never show Gotham isn't just a place, it's a mind state Watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your minds in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Don't tell 'em how you feel 'cause I promise they won't call back Everybody's in it for money, so it's all bad Killing off my demons, I'm rapping this in all black I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta Prove nothing to Gotham They ain't done nothing for me, for me
❤️🔥
man this shit is fire honestly Dax you are one of the greats, someone to go down in rap history, appreciate all your work keep it up and keep it positive.
This song is straight 🔥🔥🔥
Str88 facts 💉
Won't lie Now that the "IT'S DAX" part crap is out on every intro his music got waaay better
dax be hittin hard
i came here for gotham and i stayed for the music
Gotham♥️
i rlly cant tell u how true this rlly is till u get famous ur not really anything ontop of that multiple famous people and you tuber they say they care but they never really show
They say reals fake woke false prophets everywhere.. but what do you expect when smart people got smartphones 💯
This is my fav song by you. You’re inspirational as hell. I look up to you
Mastered all of your new songs already. Love your music dax 100%
i feel Dax is underrated af, hes a god
Rap music we need
Yooo I recently started a spirtual journey and my goodness all the metaphors in this song are crazy
Maybe just maybe I can meet him that would complete my life
The visuals to this song are perfect. Basically Dax saying fuck the corporate media if they don't like him he will do what he wants and knows is right and you can't hold him hostage by dangling the carrot of money or fame in front of him. Such a good song but the video is the icing on the cake.
Wow such a great song, one of the best I have heard in years, and this is from a 46 year old boomer.
This is officially my favourite song
Masterpiece who agrees ?
Here's the next singing so to continue... I saw someone asking you to stop singing on some other comment list. I once also believed a rapper shouldn't sing. That's like on the rocks or soda. Irrelevant What is relevant, truthfull and definitely factual is.. Many have tried singing and rapping. Some better then others but only my boy Dax here is great at both. Never ever has anyone been able to rap and sing the way you do
*finds Gotham by dax*  *listens to it* *Makes it a point to play it every single day at least once if not 70 or 80 times to remember the lesson behind it* Thank you dax
Like Dax said in Rap God the remix. He is better than sitting in his room. I honestly can't stand overweight and underattractive artists. Get off your add or stop. Lmao
Yo, saved it to my favorite list. Why? Because Dax is DMX and Pack combine to make... An original. Love this shit.
Facts
Any legend listening to this in 2021?
I don't know what's better the video or the song
This is a bomb🔥🔥from italy
Dax is Lyrical Genius  and flow is fire...
I remember everyone hating when he posted this on Insta but everyone likes it here
Absolute banger👍 Best song you’ve done
Let's be real, our boy Dax just wanted to dress up like Batman.
lit song
I'm a huge batman fan, including joker n Gotham aspects, so to see u as him is just perfect lol xx
Lord dax, ya got them, as in Gotham. The system is rigged in injustice indeed. The spirit of God ,speaks through dax, as his devine vessel. Gothem penetrate& rules the poorest &  least in riches amongst us. A reed shaken by the wind. But wisdom is justified by her children.
Wait dax is batman?
nice... keep it up man; love your music man...🥰
Remind me what’s classy.
So when is Dax going to be in a DC movie both as an actor and the artist who wrote the soundtrack?
If you didnt get it, Gotham = Hollywood/L.A
Ur a leyend
Dax isn’t just a good rapper he is also a good actor in all his videos
I Just Want To Be A Child Of God Even If I Feel The Harshness Of The World I Have Had Sex, Drinking Alcohol Pierced People Enjoying Wealth But I Was Never Happy With All Of It I am more comfortable being a servant of God and live peacefully
Awesome work
Oh Dax you can easily warp “DAX” into a bat symbol 🥊✌️
It’s a popular opinion in my house🔥
Am I the only one that stopped listening mainstream rapper after I heard dax. He has so much talent and goes unrecognised shits fucked up
Gotham batman Vs joker     On TV me eat popcorn 😂😂😂😂
Hey Dax I hope it's ok I screen recorded the elevator scene for a Tik Tok with portion of the song available to use on there. I been seeing so much BS on there lately that made me think of this song so I made a tik tok from it. Richard_The_Alien is my screen name if you want it taken down LMK. Love your music still and always jamming out to it😁
Everything DAX releases is 🔥🔥🔥 and TRUE TO HIMSELF!!! STRAIGHT RESPECT
I can relate to this so hard.  Hey dax bro if you see this I hope you know how much your music means to me I love it.
Can't stop listening bruh!!! Love it❤❤❤ much love🤍❤
Dax: "in Gotham" My latino side: "El Gato!!!"  Jokes aside If you ain't nodding to the "living in Gotham" verse then you ain't feeling it
Too fire
All I can say is thank you, been following for years but every time you make something more impressive, you haven't even reached your peak with this skill, and it equally terrifies me and impresses me knowing what you can do to this world if given a mic at the right time
Aye do you know your on ufc 4 game yooo 💯
This beat fire as hell and lyrics are straight facts 🔥🤘
Man I hope I'm not the only one that knows where he is coming from, this song hits hard and has a big meaning to it. ❤️ 🦇🦇
I really don’t wanna be famous I just want a normal life
Yooo this is so damn fucking awesome!! 🔥 The song, music, lyrics, you fighting the thugs and saving yourself!! 🔥 Damnnn!! That fight scene looked so original! 🔥
This song good
Dax is insanely underated hes an actual rapper unlike all these fake niggas
Damn Dax your I love your pragmatism
Every time I go visit all my nieces and nephews...It's like I'm a celebrity. Oldest of five, 2 boys.  William 21 years old, Joseph 17 years old. Been famous to the ones that love me. 1 Luv....your shit makes me feel good tho. Thx Dax.💕💯🔥
“ 40 nights 40 days”
If I was dax I would keep dropping joker songs just for fun and Gotham ones because the style to these songs i love and they are masterpieces
DAX
I felt that man ❤
Wow
damn this song is HEAT
i dont usually do type beats but this one sounds like you and hopsin with the quoir sound lol see what you think bro rough drafthttps://soundcloud.com/diako55/hopsin-and-daxtype-beat
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I have a theory:  It's basically impossible to start a fire in the Amazon rainforest... Science proves its extremely difficult, almost impossible, especially without mass amounts of accelerant fuel.  So, it's clear to me that the massive fire in Brazil was started by a person playing Dax...... Pure arson 🔥🔥🔥
"but what did you expect, when dumb people got smart phones?"  Wow RAaaarh!  I the track had only just started and I needed to rewind it, 3 times, just to hear that again! 🔥  I vote Dax for the next leader of the world (I'm from the UK, so can't vote him for president aha)
still one of your best songs right here 🔥
Wow really good song. Love the melody part
fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire
By far one of his best songs
Ok its official this man doesn't ever miss, I cant see how 3,000 people dislike this mans content, he's speaking the truth, his songs are great
I’m torn. I love dear god but I love this. Fuck I can’t choose a favourite. Both songs you can see the raw passion turned into words. This is the definition of following your dream x
Dax the real one ✊🏿✊🏿
Let the Joker free <3
Someone make a piano version please, *thank you*
You have become one of my favorite artists.  Ever!  Hands down!  Meaningful, real and true to the heart lyrics.  Love ya work brah!
FREE THY LOST SOULS, THEY WILL BE FOUND AND LOVED. 🙏🏼💯

How does he not have more subscribers already?
Why am I just now finding this
This man doesn't have a batman series why? 🗿
I listened to these lyrics over and over during a whole evening, and I can just say that I'm glad to have discovered a rapper who feels so human.  Sadly way too unknown despite his talent...  Keep going DAX, the truth must be told 😎👍
He spits about the truth alot🔥🔥
Anyone else feel like this is about Hollywood?
Great track and video! I know I'm late to the party and you've already surpassed 200K likes but now you have one more. Alex Hefner's reaction is what turned me on to your work. Love it!
Dax should team up with russ he would have been a perfect addition to chomp
Literally one of the most deep and at the same time one of the most harmonic you've ever done, man what am I talking about everything ya do is spectacular❤️
This is Lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥     My favorite I’m addicted 😐🤩🤩
Is that a cake or hair on your head??

You are a beast bro...
G A T O M

Best rapper right here😁🔥🔥🔥
Dax on da SICKO MODE
Bro how you smart enough to write this but dumb enough to write Hilly Hilly? the reason Trump was the best president of mine and your life time is because he committed the least amount of atrocities of any president in our life
2:30 starts the beat hard AF I want a whole song of that
Everybody needs to hear this song tbh
Merecia mais reconhecimento, o melhor da atualidade
you know travis scott mad 1:35
It’s DAX!!!
You have such a great voice!  I can relate to a lot of your music!
This should have  been on suicide squad film it's a banger great artist
Wow i just found this song and am completely amazed at Daxs talent.
I hate it when people make memes out of stuff like depression and cutting and pills and and peoples life stories...
The only geezer that can play Batman and the Joker! What a guy!
This must be on new Batman..share it this must see warner bros
So mutch
I love your raps
This is for gotham
this is the truth
Uh oh aye Dax Gotham Remix? 🤟
This guy doesn't have a limit. 👌

Fucking shivers, he puts those balls on the table is said to be whispering, 100% skills bruh
DAX YOUR THE BEST THANK YOU FOR DESCRIVING THE UNDERDAWG LIFE! IM A FAN 4 LIFE
I’ve been listening to dax since his Rap God freestyle dropped and man your one of my favorite rappers ever. You’ve helped me get through so much personal shit I can’t even begin to get into. Thank you brother. Keep up your shit.

I think this might have been my favorite rap song of 2020. Its a toss up with this and toxic revolver by mgk
Gotham = LA
I like this song but I hope you are giving Phoenix Jones credit for the obvious inspiration.
everyone has their own Gotham (prision) you just need to survive it and escape
I dont want to be famous, I would only want to be known for changing the trajectory of this one world.
Dax you are a rap legend but nowhere close in the realm of God.
Batman: if you kill a killer, the number of killers in the world stays the same Dax: Okay, but what if I blow up a building full of killers?
❤❤
Homie legit talking about my city 🌃 “Nashville” no cap 🧢 sheesh 🙄 lml...💀
Love your songs dax
Dude, you touched on something powerful. It’s dark, but true. You are incredible.
xd
Love the song my guy, can't stop listening to it, you've done it again. 👋👋, All in favor of breaking Fax outta Gotham Say I! I!!
Dax? I Am from India! And I Listen to every word you say and you're Fucking Me man! You say Everything i want to say but Can't! Thumbs up man 🙂🙂
Put at 1.25x
GOD PROTECT DAX & TOM MACDONALD🖤🌍😴😢😤🤯

So damn honest. So creative. No need for a person to rep you. You are the rep.!!
He's telling you all something ... Listen closely ...
I love u from Tanzania
The people that disliked, you know they don’t know the real world...
GOD ABOVE ALL evil👁🤫🤯
Uhm you strong, you broke the damm chains haha
Dax just talks real shit
This is a song in coding about America!
I'm so glad I started following you. Your songs are art
Full respect bro talking real shit what other rappers don't 🙏🍀
It’s funny I wanted to be “famous” work for a famous family in Beverly Hills for 2 1/2 yrs and Now I don’t want nothing to do with Hollywood they’re all fake every single one of them they do things for the “gram” just to say look at me it’s really disturbing when you see what’s really going on... Dax is dead on with this one...
Realist song ever.
One of the most culturally relevant hip hop songs of our time
So much truth than some of our pastor
Love this song is so good
He's right
Nxt 2pac
Love his music Bc they speak fax in them
I wish people would listen to this and take it to heart, but we all know the public’s eye is always blind to the truth.
Всегда плачут и обвиняют белых
The world need more rappers like you ❤❤❤❤
Batman return to the Gotham with force and loyalty!
Wow
Fuck that this was 🔥🔥🔥 Dax killed it.
funny the parallels between your blm "song" and gothams actual moral fiber
Wow
This is the realist song I’ve ever heard, this is also my favorite song ever. Love you bro, NO HOMO to the people in the back.
You deserve more and you'll get It bro Keep it up
somehow this song just makes all the sense in the world
The time is at hand and WE NEED More of THIS🎶 DAX!!   Peace, Prosperity and good Health to All
happiness is not a physical place  you  call home
Love you Dax keep doin you dude
You are now my fav rapper   My fav songs are. Joker, joker returns,gotham  Edit: four years later and I feel like e new person since then, but I always come back to these masterpieces, also, and few more songs are part of my favorites now, “book or revelations”, and “dear god”
He spittin facts
Black eminen
This good
Lol
I would not want to be famous for real life must be even harder everywhere u go they say money can make us happy but can't help with your mental health respect for this tune dax 🤘
This video is fire
Many rappers got strippers,guns,drugs and clout.but none of them have what Dax has.talent
Almost at 4 mil🔥
im addicted .....hahhaa
I don't I just want to b happy    u know what im saying, i close  my eyes to relax but all I see is horrible shit     I'm tired and I feel  it won't b long
I still don't get what this song is about
this is my 5th time watching this
Probably the best rapper to come out in a looong time
By far my favorite song from 2020, it gives me goosebumps everytime. Your music gets me through some of my hardest moments
Plz listen to krino for me Dax. Songs “flowers,so grateful,grand deception(was my first song), and the sorcerer/the wizard saga. Plz n ty. I would like you guys to do a song it would be real neat I think.
This man out here doing God’s work
Matthew 3:2.
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon.
I’m a ksi fan but this is good respect
People don’t understand that this shit is REAL LIFE  I see demons with a platform that just fucking abuse it!!
Facts for life  That’s why don’t try to act cool  Be cool.  Life is easy if you think it is but  Idfc if anyone likes it or not
Dax should be batman
Dam daxxx you go bro your bars have so much meaning I this

Everyone let’s make this song trend. Let’s make every underrated rapper famous.
OMG iTs EgGs Ex tEncion
Joker did not have thos moves
aye dax!! i’ve noticed you talk about people trying to profit off another’s work in a few songs, i’m curious about that..
dax is pretty lit. Idk why hes not as big as he should be
🔥
I could easily say this song is relatable like everyone else(it is but still) but I ain't seen anyone talk about all the refrences you made to actual comics in your video. Bro knows his source material, which hypes me up on this song even further. Great video, hope for more like it!!
Wow my favourite now
So fire
He should be mainstraim soon
Love it bro keep em coming
Thank you for sharing your pain with me DAX! You're helping me get through my pain! I can't say i wish you never been hurt because your pain is important to me now. I do however hope you feel better soon! I love you DAX.
So we’re just not  gonna talk about how many people just killed a explosion
I be shaking while listening to your music too
If you listen to the song with headphones the " I ain't gotta's are on different sides
Bruh this is lit💯 love the real music. Fake gotta go time is up.
“Ain’t nobody see you til’ you get 1 million followers and when you do they treat you like you someone and you validated” absolute fire bro keep up the greatest music

This is my first time hearing this singer and...DAAAAAAM...this is FIRE.
I feel it thanks man
this is 🔥🔥
YOU SAVE YOUR SELF
O N L Y             T A L E N T🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dax you have read the Bible and sounds like you have a good trip on what's really going on... nice
Everyone can quote me when I succeed in this ambition. Dax I will someday do a song with you. No not for notoriety and not for the creation of the steady decline of humanity. Just by the lyrics you express shows me that you have the vision for a betterment of humanity. And I couldn't give a fuck less whether or not you read this.. many people probably state things such as this often. But the difference is.. no one will know who I am. I will utilize my talent to bring back realism. Dax mark my words... Wait for R3B0RN to ask for a feature...
Omg you're amazing. You're so creative thank you for inspiring.
Super lyrics
ITS DAXXXX
DAX IS ON FIRE 🔥🔥.  These songs are all so real. Keep up the good vibes.
Dax is woke
be yourself ;)
Redo ,repeat ,sleep, double tap, see ,copy🔥🔥
Hope he makes it big  he’s dope
Am I the only one just walking around randomly  singing this chorus? I can’t be. Right?
WTB subtitles!
When he turn into Batman I start laughing lol
Best music and best man
this song changes my life. thank you from bottom of my heart god bless you for this master piece #DAX_NATION

I Hope he knows Gotham isn't a real place
New collab is with trippie red

Easily the most relevant message to the 21st century, master piece. Ps, your Batman cosplay has me in stitches 🤣

Damn I feel this hardcore, every fkn time
Honestly man I write my own stuff and listening to your bars inspires me deeply. I haven't related to an artist like this in a long time. And it's always exciting when you like my comments. I hope one day you can reply 😅 but likes are really cool too. I just love your craft and your style so much and I find your bars deep and heartfelt. They are inspiring me to write about a person I had a nasty falling out with. It's so therapeutic.
My son introduced me to @dax damn pure fire! Wow!
**inspired by Travis Scott aka black Batman
Only rapper that I know likes people comments
It been years, since I could sing a song word for word, nothing ever stuck. Dax, your music is fire, and your words to Gotham, even more so. Might not be able to buy all your albums when they drop, but your music will stick with me. Thank you for all you hard work.
Damn Dax, be speakin mad facts great song!
KSI IS BETTER
Mate Ive know  dax for 1 month and he’s my fav rapper
🔥🔥🔥true talent
dax is the best rapper ive heard in awhile keep up making bangers
This guy is amazing.
My girlfriend said she didn't like this song... She's single now.. I hate nonsense..
Awesome !!
this guy is interesting - i'm enjoying his lyrics
Has a roses by Kanye feel on the beat. Love it Dax
Se transformo en Travis xd 1:34  Buen tema por cierto
That verified check on the forehead was the most relatable thing I’ve seen that perfectly explains this harsh reality we all must live in but through our struggles together we can survive any storm thrown at us! Merry Christmas to everyone and may everybody have a happy New Years! 💯
Dax you are great
Yow mi just a listen to ur songs yow speak truth I love u
Nice bro
You’re everything, my dude.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 KEEP SPITTING THAT REAL SHIT.🙏🏽 PEACE AND BLESSINGS TO YOU.
This is the reason I’m not famous... no other reason
Dax man. I spent all night listening to your music. You have given me clarity, thank you for saying it for me, I needed to hear it. I'm about to get the fuck up and save myself. You changed me.
Holy shit gotham is hard and he keeps us 100%
Dax, you a genius man💯. Life is deeper than the surface, most people only see the surface, you're one of the few who sees the deeper and more significant things in life
Damn this just popped up after Joker Returns in my playlist and it's so fire!! I relate to a lot of your music (not the being famous part tho) and every new track I hear (new to me) I'm just taken back by your talent and your ability to say what everyone that is depressed is thinking, is astounding!!  You take your emotions and turn it into art. The best songs come from anger and emotions. I love your talent and your craft. Its unique and you have your own style which just makes every song sound new and exciting. Sorry, I know this is a long comment but damn man, your skill is amazing.
On some real shit, you can spit you killed it. I like it.
Another 🔥 song
Music fire, videos fire... DAX is the new way to spell DOPE!!!
shiet you good. I like. :) thanks for poppin on my facebook feed hahaha.
Id rather be broke and return to God Almighty than be a puppet
🔥🔥
Dax is one of my top 3 favorite rappers
I'm going to continue to post #BetterThanEminem until you put it in a song
I want to stop rasinis
this is a fackt
Hey cutie
I love your music
This is fire
can u be my dad
Dax honestly you are one of the greatest rappers in the whole world
I like to say I'm in the "background"
🔥🔥🔥
PAC would be PROUD .
This deserves way more than 3 mil
I been listening to this repeatedly this song is real asf 🔥😤  "everybody wants fame but dont Care what its for" you can relate to this song hella and people really act like this
amazing
What do you expect when sumb people got smart phones remember that when you try to hate on someone online
wow the king
I love you so much and I think it's like a super dose of life as it is the perfect description of who I am the opposite people turn away from me people judge me people judge me people judge me people think that I'm just a little bit of a new one of the group I brought it to the table stand to the table and the general public may agree with them and even if they do not have a talent for the sake of the group I brought it to the table predictive text saidthat wtf
🗝️🔥🖤
You feel special? That someting that yu're not.......  You're more than that man you're gunna make the diference between a good rapper and a real rapper
"I don't like Rap." I said to myself for the last 29 years. The occasional song of Em may be great, but he has more than equal songs that are just crap and the great ones were just exceptions to the norm. I never could relate to the shit he wrote about his mom and his Ex. People may have different opinions about shit, but calling out his family like that made me lose all respect. And lets not even mention the ones that can only write about where they put their dicks and their money and what they take to kill the rest of their brain. But Today is a great day. Today I broadened my musical horizon. Today I found TWO amazing Rappers entirely by accident. Shoutout to the Youtube Algorithm. And thank you for your Art Dax and Tom MacDonald! P.S.: Recommend more please
You are so creative and so educational
as a huge Batman fan, and a huge fan of *DAX* i approve so much.
This is amazing!!!
He has a good voice.
Real talent
Dum people got smartphones
Open-minded Multi-faceted...  crazy-talented..  this guy will get knighted one day..   mind you.. not if it's going all the way ROBOTIC MINDSTATES AI NWO
That moment you realise batman isnt a hero just an antihero
Dax really likes batman
Amazing song
If Batman was the goat fighting dax would be the Batman of rapping
I love that in the end, he saves himself.
Finally.  Finally.  I've been waiting for your messages for two dozen years! You've captured the words that our world must hear.  Well done, Dax.
Honest bro u ain’t someone I wanna take from u be speaking facts yo music reinforced my faith and changed my perspective. I ain’t tryna fan boy or nothin u just seem like a chill dude
Am having a night full of dax ... u vibe differently
Good thing dax didnt make his batman costume look like travis scotts
When you tryna please everyone you're a lost soul. When you tryna please god you've found yourself. Either you're slave to people or to god. Choose wisely. Ask God for help, he'll free you from imprisonment
5sos
This is the clean beat
This man got a big as ego, And I love that
Another banger
I love it
Subscribed solely on this song.
They should use this song on the batman movie
Gotham reminds me of LA
I love this song
Dax only speaks Facts.
This i listen everyday it makes my day I never expected this dang song it 🔥🔥🔥 better then rap god by slim shady ur a type of rapper that has to put his  emotions in his song it so good
BRAZIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Yo didn’t Hopsin do a song that was  basically saying the same kinds shit but hopsins was like years ago same with the Christmas stuff hopsin was on. That before this Dax guy was !!! don’t get me wrong Dax is talented asf but seems like he’s just doing everything hopsin has done years before this ! Correct me if I’m wrong!! And he’s kinda doing  the sane shit  like Joyner Lucas did just remixing everyone’s songs expect when Joyner  remixed a song it was always way better then thevoriginal! ‘ every songs joyners remixed I only listen to the Joyner Lucas versions!! But they are all extremely talented men ! I think it would  be so Dope to hear a song by Joyner hopsin and Dax that shit would literally be fucking insane!  Anyone. Agree !?
Yo this shit fire keep it up 🤑
some true fact and fire here
This man  spitting out FAX
YO EVERYONE!! THIS WAS SICK AS EXPECTED...but I need you to go see my new edit of dax's zeze freestyle from 2 yrs ago.GO!! :) https://youtu.be/VIREFlzTQMg
Nice  man it's good and can u shout out my channel its iamnotbear_bg
burn
You know he cares about more than the money, when he takes the time to like all the comments.
Where have you been all my life?
Gotham is the world.
but rly ur hair has rly creative style i dont know why ppl make fun of it
Swap gotham with Hollywood I'm guessing?
2:12 and on, where’s my enlisted brothers that prolly felt this a little harder?
Does anyone get an eagles type vibe from this? Like hotel California???
this so true (sadly)
too bad batman doesnt kill because dax murdered this song
Batman needs Dax
Bro u went off in this. I’m still listening to this 1 month later
Weren’t you the joker?
no one can compare themselves to dax. hes just different from others.🔥🔥🔥
Batman
real music bro..
I feel shame cuz I didn't know about this before
Lyrics: A Style: B+ Message: B- It doesn’t feel new, but it does seem necessary for some.  He’s already ahead of most.  I’m really interested in seeing what Dax will write in the future.
Dude to your work... no words to it! Keep it up! Huge thanks for all of your work from Hungary!!🔥
This song has a deep meaning and I think I know what it is just by looking at the lyrics :O
lourddd⚀⚀🔴
Dax got whole firm to like the coments no cap
Redo, repeat, double tap, see, copy...
Can’t wait 4 his new songgg

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I been woke since 3 years old.... havent ever slept since.. @Dax #Dax
Imagine if the world would take Dax's words and Truely listen to them, let them sink in, understand them, unite and fix what is broken. Just imagine... keep your head up everyone ❤ one day at time
Bro I fucking love your music thank you so much
Chilliwack bc canada is gotham jr
This is the best!!!!!
What did you expect when dumb people got smartphones 😂🔥
"Everyone want fame they don't care what it's for"🔥🔥🔥
dax is the hottest rapper in my opinion like damnn bruu
Am I the only ones that recognises the two Parkour experts in the video
The part where he said "Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel When you take that time away from your phone" I mean damn this is so relatable for so many. I know for a fact Dax makes it so easy for reaction channels to react to his music. He really puts so much work into these music videos and songs.
I am addicted to this song
Had to play around with this beat. Thank you Dax.  https://youtu.be/6V-eRfIzHrU
daxman as much as you sing the better i save myself from not killing my self dax think you and keep you music alive you will make it to the top 5  i hope but plz dont ever die homie  live life to your fullest  fuck the ppl that wrong you
Dax dont Fear coronavirus coronavirus fears Dax
ʕ •́؈•̀ ₎( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Only reason I like this song is because it’s not overplayed
family and friendships are more important than money some paper can only give you so much but a relationship can give you the world
Dax you feel like home!
Me every second "What did you expect when dumb people get smartphone"🥺
DC: we have some of the best superheroes including batman Dax: how about I become DaxMan
Dax you should be the next batman i love your music and the power you have with your words mean more than any amount of strength
I love it it just showed up in my recommended I like the Motto don’t let the fame take ahold of anyone’s life Dax has a good message I just wish more people knew how to read it
This is what the young kids should be listening too 💯🔈
keep it up king
Soo cool
DAX! DAX! DAX!
This straight heat! I have it on repeat 🔥
Dax saving himself from this system. Save yourself is the lesson I'm getting from this
Great song 🎵😏😏😏😎😎😎
Fuck having Edward from twilight play batman. #DaxForBatman
After watching for a long time i see this after watching all the joker videos which I love more to me personally but still love this it seems as the batman side is the good of your self or whats in the cranium fighting and pushing on regardless how hard it is but the joker videos are more related to the bad and the hard time of the pushing can set a man aside from himself i see your stories and respect them to the max so thank you and your human like the rest of us it's okay to breath hommie much love.
Dax spits some truth in this song
Message from France ur the best actually.
Bro keep up the music never give up
Oh and eminem has got to get ahold of you!! Real talent 👏
Dude is fire!! Next 2 pac!! When he raps he has meaning and you can understand his story he's telling. My new favorite rapper!! Keep it real bro keep up the good work bro!!

I might not can relate and exactly the same way as what he's saying but I still can relate is so true we all live in a little bit of a Gotham
THIS SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Fake shit goes viral, we know this wont, when they say they'll care but they won't"  #straightfactsDAX
Dumb people with smart phones - this is legend.
Dax needs to be Batman in the movies
Hotel California of Rap
Holy shit! A rapper that straight spits without talking about drugs. Dax is straight 🔥

SUPER STAR
"I'm tired of sleeping on the floor I abhor being the hero makes you have to live the life of a zero."
Brooooo.. that some real sh1t... you are on another level. Sorry I slept on you til now . .. this needs to be viral like you said it probably wont be. Only 200k likes to now this should have had millions by now! .. people cant like what they know to be true and it goes against everything they've been told!! Then they would have to admit they were wrong and that whole higalean dialectic would crumble their world !! You're a fkn monster bro!! Keep it up there may be none better!
artist 100%
As promised https://soundcloud.com/jorge-glenn-sanso/gotham-dax-cover sorry for the bad mixing thou
You know why you like that shits you did something deferent people that's mean you pushing yourself to hell...don't be cry that's your fault...! Let's did something like people, please, thankfully....

Yeah dax would destroy KSI in a fight with those skills
DAXMAN :D
The message ❤
:(
"Gotham isnt a place it's a mindstate watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow" that bar is so true please keep it up dax, I've also sent this song to like 15 friends and they said they love it. !!
Did u actually wear a fuckin batman costume man
Dax really went off holy moly
Dax is a lyrical genius 🔥🔥🔥 His flow is also so good but I don't understand why this masterpiece has 3million views but those lil blah blah rappers get so much views without saying a word properly
didn't know gotham was in hollywood
Yo he should play batman in the new movie
Armpet hair mate
Truly an amazing artist!!! Keep inspiring others DAX
Dax finally up
Raw, real and honest af. Dax is special y'all and should be appreciated as such.
just cuz someone got fame they treat them differently , this song hit me fr
Some men just want to watch the world burn..
Keep up the good work my man
Gosh.. You're sooo good🙌🏾❤
Dax:Fake shit goes viral we know this won't 3.3M people: hm...
You Sayed the mother fucking truth.... Respect DAX🙌🙏
Hey Dax I think in one of you’re YouTube stories I think I said “ksi is better or make better music “ but after listening to your music I realize how fire you are 🔥 my apologies
I think I’m watching the wrong miles morales gameplay
He is the Beethoven and Mozart of Rap Music...This young man is a true artist.He needs to do NPR tiny desk concert to really Blow up.
Damn you’re music is straight poetry, I’ve never felt something so much
none i want to just live life
Great song man I love it. This feels like it also applies in society not just fame, but it's the reality of money the root of all evil
Could u do a Gotham part 2👀
Red hood is next
Next Eminem
Ok so we all know Dax can rap. But him singing the chorus in this song is absolutely haunting. Id legit love a blues album...
I dont wanna be famous
💯
Title: GOTHAM What we're hearing : GATHOM
Will you please do a viny? I would buy that in a heartbeat.
Music is music but it’s a lot of Politics #flavor I got the #message
#1 SONG
I'm honestly really impressed. I'm glad to have a lyrical rapper that has a badass flow rather than a slow mumbler "rapper". Keep it up Dax. You got a true talent!
Dax his videoclips are on another level
Dax is a G👑
That's what happends when the master starts fearing the student
🔥🔥
Dax is one of the only real rappers. Love you! Respect you, keep it up! (Yall he unliked my comment) 😐
Dax you are such a good rapper love your music  man
If you guys don't know this is my fiance account I've listened to nearly every song he's made and if you listen to the song cos of the lyrics and not for the beat you will here the real story gothem is fame aka the music industry Ive been writing for years and years and I want to make it but what he saying in this song you think people who ain't famous have to survive yes that's true but when you make it where dax is they make it harder to survive so if you want to make it be sure to be ready to go to war
Wait he is joker and Batman 🤔
Janitor from Gotham
IF ANYBODY DISSES THIS MAN IN COMMENTS ON GOTHAM JOKER AND JOKER RETURNS , I HOPE YOU GET A REAL LIFE SOMETIME   you're a real lyricist my friend < just got put on you and I couldn't be happier , mental health is a BIG problem in my life , stay safe DAX , you are the fucking man
This is sad but true no one would want to talk to you unless your famous.
2:12 No words can describe how amazing those lyrics are. There so true.
this song is way to deep and meaningful !!! masterpiece
I wonder if any one knows how spritural this man is!!ur song is everything that going on bro ,a swear I respect you 💯💯👍🏿
Anyone know if the word Pandemonium is in any DAX lyrics? I tried a search but it was useless.   Thanks Adam https://youtu.be/SN5GjLnW2SY
You either die a Hero or live long enough to become the Joker...
You are defiantly a red pill my friend, who has unplugged from the matrix.
Discovered your channel via a link! Glad I did! I really enjoyed this song and video! New subscriber😘 keep up the good work
You have solid bars but your hook is kinds anoying and generic
Eh yuh lyrics hard toppy  keep up the work 👍
the whole joker joker pt2 and gotham trilogy is just fire because it's so real and relatable. you can feel the emotion in every flow like wow man. this is what real music is suppose to be about.
🔥🔥♥️♥️💪
It is a common tragedy when people become big and famous, but they lose who they are as well as all the people who helped them along the way. As always, your songs are spitting facts.
Love this👆👆
He ain't smiling
Whos man is this.  Get him more recognition. He deserves it
You're better than most rappers out there! IT'S DAX <3 speaking FACTS :) <3

Yo Dax, thanks for being real and talking about Demons my man. I've had plenty of them even went to war with the devil bro and God set up a obstacle course for me and I conquered them all man. Been rough with all these Demons out here lurking just waiting for me to have a chip in my armor bro. I do it for the people not for my recognition but for y'all. Stay 💯 Dax. Love your music man 🔥💓💖

Just started to listen to all your music dax... Your shit really hits me bra
ima be honest, that bat suit pre dope.    not as dope as the song. well done brotha, as always dax.
I never wanted fame nor more money than i need to get by... i can wait for 3 paychecks to buy new stuff and after all you don't really need everything you buy anyway.. yet.. no money, no fame brings criticism and being called weird crazy or simply wrong is common for such toughts when nobody believes you can be happy with less and yet when you have alot is not enough. Let that sink in
It’s been a very long time since someone in the rap game has talked about real issues facing society. Keep doing what you are doing Dax, I’m glad i found your music.
Unpopular opinion: best Dax song right here 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  Jeeeeeeeee
I love your music bro I relate to it on a deep level it makes me happy to know that I'm not the only one who feels like there surrounded by fake people who weren't there when your at low but when your doing good in life they leech off of you and take everything from you
Who has watched this more that 10x
YOUR AMAZING 🤩
This is fire✊
Hes talking about how dark the music industry selling your soul for fame gotham=hollywood
Even after both jokers this still same level if not higher🐐
Your voice gives me chills dude
Really good rapper I can feel this
Hey Dax Like the 10th time I watched it I noticed something. Most of The links to the chains are cut  when you’re chained up. Why?
Dax, I badly need it and I'm from Congo. Just a featuring is that can get me famous!
Dax releasing the most real bars in 2020. The puppet masters. Please stay you Dax!!!
*3.1 M* !!!!! Let go fam....
Shit is real as fuck!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow can't believe I've not heard you before! Your music is amazing! Keep it up bro!
50 year old San Antonio Texas male here.  First time hearing you.  I'm a new fan!!!!!!!! @dax keep up the great work.  Where can I buy an album and get your autograph?
c le 100 I am french
Extremely underrated song man. Keep your head up Dax, the vibe with this song is literally so unreal but real at the same time wtfff.
Dax man your an amazing artist, pure talent and creativity, I can tell how smart you are from everything you put into your craft, thank you for being amazing at what you do
I love this song man, love all of your music man 🙂 🔥🔥
The sad reality is the world really is becoming like gotham city the strong prey on the weak and nobody really cares about their fellow man its practically everyone for them self and we shouldn't prey on others just because we can the world has become so fucked up with so much injustice and so many people too cowardly to do what's right its enough to drive a sane man mad what happened to us as a society what happened to innocent until proven guilty what happened to equality where did the good values go I don't even recognize the world I live in no more I cant even truly trust the people I feel like I should be able to  because I cant ever let my own guard down not even when I'm alone I hope one day we will fix all that's wrong with the world
I keep replaying this, so much truth. Not only holywood but its just how everyone thinks now. I'm not even on social media but it still makes me depressed. goddamn. Love you my man, your music has so much truth, all love my man.
Lyrics is "as real as it gets" 🔥🔥🔥, this song touches the feelings that are kept hidden deep❣️
Glad i found you up here on youtube,consistently putting out some 🔥
But why?
I love this song, I love how you mange to talk about the mass mentality people have such as people don't care about you until they think they can get something from you. This video is amazing and has meaning; lyrics that you have to read into to understand similar to NF.
This is facts. This is real real. 💕
Happiness is not a physical place you call home. -Dax
GUYS!! Don't miss the message he is giving🔥👊🏼
yo Dax keep up with the grind
I would wanna be famous but I would like to earn that my self from scratch

Favorite dax song 🔥
You're music Dax, it hits different. I love it. Thank you!
I can't decide if I want to see Dax play Batman or Joker more in a movie.
This sounds more like Dax complaining about the fact that he’s not verified on every platform.😐
DC after my own heart ❤. DAX HAS MORE THAN NAILED IT!
remember sitting in school saying “it’s dax” 2-3yrs later he up like he said shii would happen🙏🏾🙏🏾 inspirational

Breath taking  this is why you are the best
I think im a caveman  Because i think i just discovered fire
This shyt is so great I make my mom watch it... And she loves it to haha
The message of truth appears to be really hitting you heart-core, I'm going to say it again because this message of truth changes realities and saves souls, as I see daily with my sharing and witnessing. Its illegal to use a legal name, all I.D is fraud, you are not a name and are so so much more than that; Read the BCCRSS https://bccrss.wordpress.com. Much law-ve Dax and keep going within and pulling out all those lies and fake gotham demons and shine like the star that I know you are and witnessing you become.
Yo dax I love you dawg and love your music keep going I been listening to you for a while and plan to always have your music be a part of my life
💕💕💕💕💯💯💯
Insanely good song with an amazing message I might carry for the rest of my life

You know an artist is real when you scroll through their comments section and see thy have liked almost every single comment. Dax makes real music and I greatly appreciate that man. Keep it up bro, you in my prayers.
It's eye for an eye till everybody blind
I love that "and thats exactly how gotham turns you into a slave" part
Tbh I don’t want to be famous I just want enough money to take care of my family
Dang “you wouldn’t know real if it slapped you right in the face” damn Dax that’s true
I’m crying because Dax is sooo good 😭🔥🔥🔥
"How bad do you want to be famous.." therapy session right quick.  Props to the camera guy as well. Great video and song dax. Live it up

Dax this is honestly speaking to me with everything being exaggerated on social media and this helped me, hope you see this
Man🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yoo.. the lyrics so damn deep dawg :'( the chorus always gives me goosebumps omfg xD.

Legendary🔥
About to use this on my essay against social media. For sure. It’s Dax ❤️
Ive honestly  never seen this much lyricism bars and straight up facts in a rap song at the same time and this is coming from a ksi fan
Batman's 1 rule never kill  Dax: leaves people ina building and blows it up
I love your music man. Great work.
superb and mind-blowing....👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️
<3
Your gonna save this rap game, I just know it.
Dax ur a pure bad ass with ultra instinct potential 😂🤙🤙🤙
First off, I want to say thank you for your music. You're an amazing person not only because your music is absolutely amazing but moreso because you're real. To find a rapper, singer or any other type of celebrity who shows that they too are human and have flaws is rare, more rare than it should be. You're an awesome person who is more real than a lot of the people out there and I truly appreciate that. I appreciate as well how you speak the truth despite all the people out there trying to tear you down because they can't handle the truth. You are an awesome artist and you have a truth to tell, so keep doing you. I wish you the best of luck going forward and hope you're well.
I Feel like the meaning of this song is that he is mirroring Gotham to the real world and as a society we are stuck in our ways
Dax you are my favorite keep up the great work and Joker returns that hit different so did this song
Please make a track with Hopsin, Ekoh, and Tom McDonald.
Dax, reply this comment so we can see it's not bot
Holy shit man
Love ur realness sir

Dax feels the same way David Bowe felt when he wrote the song Fame! He saw what fame did to people! Mad respect to this man! Corrupt government and media is turning us into slave!
Dude this is awesome my guy keep it up

Daxs music really makes you think.
You truly inspire me, I fricking love dc and so glad that other people appreciate dc's dark side and characters, and the message in this music video is so true about today's world , thank you so much dax God bless you
'I  be shaken when I right my rhymes" when there was a slight beat drop and his voice dropped too lol, i liked that cant lie, i used to look at this dude as the guy ksi mess and the incident with tory lanes but Nah tory was wrong for pulling up with his goons plus bro DAX got some real shit here, every line in this has a meaning and I liked it, bars on bars, ksi can't even right like this but yeah DAX you a great lyricist but I think you to pure lol for the chorus that Gotham word is kinda harsh to be in a chorus but you make it work
Your music is such a fucking outlet for me dude 😭
Speaking truth stay woke. Love the music 💯
Hey man I just found out about u from jack harlows remix,  I LOVE rappers who speak truth,  rap on real things.  Kanye,  most of the time,  you,  j cole, Joyner Lucas.  You're intelligent and will have a lasting impact and will be around,  the media and music industry prolly would shy away from making u the top star,  but they always flame out anyways,  ur the hare in the tortoise race and I thank you for doing what u do.  It's inspiring.
Hence why the wise and open mind will never give that up fot any amount of matetrialistic wealth.
🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Dax Yu got them bars
Yeah Dax, keep goimg yu gonna be the next after the Weeknd...xo

I don't doubt that you know the story but here's the story I think that you are looking for in this day, because it's the day that that is nearly upon us, it's the prophecy of the valley of vision, in Isaiah chapter 22 through to 35:10, it begins right after the great quake spoken of in revelation, the one that would be felt across the entire planet, I hope you enjoy

if anyone says this is trash then you're just denying the real truth of the word and I'm only 15 but I know that there's people who don't give a fuck about how you feel and fake themselves inside and out just to have more people like them and it's really starting to piss me off but what I say is that people are gonna judge you anyways so why fake who you are to still get judged just be who you really are and you'll be happier in life
My guy, I've listened to your music for a while, and yet you STILL somehow astonish me with how you've absolutely outdone yourself, one song after another. I freaking love you dude, and I mean that. Keep it up, please!
This is real
Even if iam not a big fan of Dax he still spitting the realist shit I’ve ever heard in a song ✊🏽
I’m a metal head and not too big on rap/hip-hop these days but Dax is my shit. Yet to hear something I don’t like. Keep it up bro, lovin’ what you’re doin’. 🤙🏻

I don't know why I'm so late to the party, but I gotta say 2 things. 1.) This is the best song I've heard in a while, period. Hats off for this masterpiece. 2.) Is it just me or does Dax look exactly like RZA, but with the unique hairstyle to differentiate him? Anyway, keep up the amazing work!

I BE SHAKIN WHEN I WRITE MY MUSIC
I love how he likes our comments
Give dax all the respect

Shout out animesh jha
No money, no guns, no drugs, no naked woman... just pure talent
Once when i was in 10th grade I commented on a dax freestyle "bit off drake" and he replied with a heart emoji. Joker really opened my eyes about it
Let you reach your own limit then heroically save
Dax was speaking the truth, Gotham is used as a replacement of life.
Dax man u bringing back the og rap...I fuckin love it man keep doing what u do...fuck them new rappers who just destroyed rap...u spitting bars man jheeeeesh
This guy is a FREAK OF NATURE 🔥🔥🔥YALL AND GOT NOTHING ON DAXX
The first song ive heard from dax,the 1st time i heard it i didnt think nothing of it but the second time i heard it for what it is Amazing work
TuPac has been reborn....
I ain't fragile honey. You & me? Two sides of the same coin. I love you.
I love your music so much and hope your like gets better. Idk how this could help but all I can hope is that it does.
Really can't believe after over a million views likes and subs and thousands of comments your still liking every comment I've been her since she cheated and she cheated again it's amazing to see how far you've came keep up the good work this is inspiration
This is straight 🔥🔥
The thing is that all the things he’s saying is all true and his the most woke out of all of us this man is on a whole different level
interesting terms u tuch in this text of  track
I just recently discovered you, but this and Joker 2 ... dude. You are obviously a deeply introspective and multi faceted individual.  I respect that trait in folks. Awesome.
Dax ur in my top 5 rappers i was ur fan from start it would make my day if u could follow me on insta @darkwinner6
This is straight facts. I wish people would understand these words and understand how fucked up our society is.  I hope this will happen one day, where people dont look down on people based on money or social media followers. Have a good day
Best song I’ve heard
Daxman
You definitely have talent
Dude is just dope. I don’t know how else to put it. It’s like he’s created his own sub category of rap. He puts out art with every word, video ect.
Really love your style. Keep it up
I seriously love when this man sings. The skills, its incredible. His music with a message strikes a part of the concious mind, that forever leaves his foot print. I'm so happy I had discovered him back than, and that I continue to stay to see his continuous growth and evolution in this crazy world. 🙏
holy shit this legend is deadass one of my top three favorite artist now holy hell 🔥
So I'm just now listen to this guy for the first time and I got to say I have not heard a single cuss word much respect to your music man thank you it's nice to hear quality music without cussing every 5 minutes
I can't belive I made it this far in life with out hearing about Dax. Lyrically the man is A+,  and his flow I can't get over the flow and meaning behind his songs. Glad I came across you in my recommened.
mad respect, Dax says it how it is
Dax has so much talent bro 💯 and he’s so relatable 💯👌🏾❤️

STOLE THIS VIDEO FROM EKOH
He got rhymes
this dude is cold ! please God protect him ❤️❤️ its Dax ! i been follow you since "she cheated " Goat
I love this song i know im late but dax this dope🤯
Gotham is a colloquialism for those who live at the bottom(and those who live high above the poor), but poverty ridden people fight and claw to get to the top of the food chain...not knowing the poor and rich are both sinners, lost in the same world. It’s our thoughts, the way we speak, the way we dress, our actions, etc... but open eyes realize that we don’t have anything to prove to anyone and that our journey is only truly birth after we choose a false road offered by the world; we either find ourselves in the mist of madness, lies, and deceit as we walk a worldly road or we become more lost in trying to be like the world...I don’t know, but this is my view point of a song that’s really deep by a highly talented individual.
Dax, you are an inspiration man, you keep doin what you doin bro, huge support!
This is legit our world today!!!! keep GIVEING That TRUTH. ❤️🙌
The first song i heard from you was amazing and have followed you ever since, you and a man named Tom on YouTube are the only ones whom seem to speak the truth, im glad I found you and have heard many of your songs keep up the good work
You’re lyrics are insane bro. Killing the game is an understatement of what you are doing as well as helping the countless people that you are by hearing these words. Much respect to you.
Wow I feel this nigga ....I love u man
How do you juggle being Batman and the joker?
Potential soundtrack for the next Batman movie

Thank you fam I felt this so deeply spiritually this was so  encouraging because I don't feel so alone in a city of "Gothom" wish I could meet you in person fam God bless bro
I became a fan not too long but I've literally listened to all Dax Messages.  We think same way bro.  "Everything you see on the Tv is exaggerated"
i got here after watching ksi roast you but damm you dropping some heat this is awesome love the work man underrated
And Just like that TRUTH HAS BEEN SPIT bars on bars long live ITS DAX ! good luck to wack rappers trying to take the throne.
Dax is an artist, and this song is his masterpiece.
Omg finally. A rap artist who doesn't talk about bitches money and drugs
But what did you expect when dumb people got smart phones
I'm a be a lyrical rapper. I'm 14 now but soon I'll post my music I got. Dax helped realize what is real.
Thanks man,,rap virtuos ART IN ALL MILLISEKUNDS
Favourite song
I mean the costume is better than Travis Scott's
And I’m over here new thinking that Joyner Lucas was the only one who can tell a crazy story with crazy visuals
Dax knows the prize of every wasted  blood !
Dax is hands down my new favorite artist! He’s going places
In the city your a number they don’t see you as human really hit
Gotham= Hollywood
Dax is my inspiration 🔥
i dare y'all to find a comment w no dax liking it
SAVE OUR CHILDREN ALL THE CHILDREN WORLDWIDE ESPECIALLY AFRICA!!!!!! IN BLACK JESUS ALMIGHTY NAME! 🙏. SUNSHINE777
I love the detail put into these videos. I noticed that on the "Hip Hop Meter" in the bottom left it has everyone's plan. "Befriend//Take Money//Backstab" Dax really know what he talking about.
"What did you expect when dumb people got smartphones?" That line hit home. I see all these people on snap and insta talking about the dumbest shit. They're all arguing over nothing. I honestly just wanna go back to before I got social media, but I'm too far in to back out. Why tf can't all rappers be like my man Dax here? They all rap about stuff that don't matter or don't apply to everyone, but Dax is talkin about the stuff that matters. And he actually cares about the people who look up to him. Mad respect bro. ❤️ Keep up the great work.
swore 4 times 2 shit 2 fuck  Everything else bars...! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your story Delivered with each word word is beyond perfect the storyline🔥🔥exquisite.
The best artist out there right now💖💖💖🙏🏻

This man is his own form of rap, I will say this though, he carries the rap game, but so does nf. Don’t ever sleep on either of them, and I’d LOVE to hear a collab between nf and Dax. Just a deep, deep song filled with anger as well.
Dax is the real deal. I still need a collabo of him and Em
Copying EKOH?
lemme just add this to the things that kept me alive in 2020
You inspire people, don't stop please! #bless 🙏🙌 Respect
DDDDAAAAAAXXXXXXXX
Ur music is art.  I feel like when i heard tech 9 for the first time .   (Im old lol )   shits deep.  Its real.  And intelligent.   .   Beats make u wanna turn up full volume.
idk where to start with this. Dax man you are a lyrical mastermind.  Every track is a sermon or a eulogy. I write my thoughts down when I can't get the words to come out my mouth. But you have an ability to do both. You are definitely one of my favorites of all time already. Wish you nothing but the best man.
Just binged both joker songs and gotham rn fucking amazinggg
No one:  Absolutely nobody:   Travis Scott: wishing he had bought that batman suit instead 1:34
Godamn this go crazy bro how people still sleeping on you and ksi said you sing got no message in your songs🤦‍♂️this fire
Your songs are so relatable.
Hate it took me so long to come see the videos to these masterpieces you bee. Dropping but trust streaming tf outta ya
Already commented on this video! Was talking to my wife about u. Telling her how u are a real G when it comes to fans!!! Told her I would  at least get a heart or like some reply.  Bet that I will! Love your music now she is enjoying it 2!!!
yeah dax's song is fire but that batman suit tho
Holy moley. This song relates. I feel like we are literally living this. Or literally will be soon. I feel like you’re one of those “white hats” who are preparing us for the truth and for the good. And I appreciate you. Plus you make good music. That’s a ++
I feel like I   Should help my friends and family because that’s all I have   But that  all i need   I feel again all time but some happiness  i feel lonely but I think I just need  someone love me and be with me for every day I’m a silage boy that is love anyone my birthday is come up i will 18 years old  this song  git me throw it.😔
Love it Dax! Keep it up :)
So damn talented!! Been watching your videos and appreciate your talent and creativity!
Best rapper artist beat musician alive
Deym you're songs has so much emotion
You are such an amazing artist bi love your music seriously man you are so awesome
New to your music, and it's already a wonderful journey! Great musical talent!
I don’t know if I commented on this song but I don’t really care to look so here’s another lol. This song is just describing the world now and it looks simple to famous people but not for lower end people who barely have anything and I love this video so much this is now the only artist (throwback from when he said he was artist in first kill shot) I listen to
Much love Dax. Stay strong man.
The way you put the truth so simple yet so complex . It's a shame how many people might have missed some major truths. Thank you for being one of the voices of the humans in the world. Now only if we could all stand united and make a real change. Thank you for giving us the truth .
Can't nobody fuck with the boy Fax rn. He on 🔥 fr
Best DC type style song.
This is a master piece i have goose bumps right now!
At least he didn’t mention being a janitor
You're bless bro continue doing what you do ❤❤❤❤
Bro, i really love your music. From Italy🇮🇹
4 years ago I was jamming to "hilly hilly hilly Clinton" now my my heart hurts because shit keeps getting real. Dax my God
“I be shaking when I write my music” I feel that
Rather have real people than fake what's point in being famous when everyone is fake
It's good to know that I'm not the only one that believes this shit.  More real rappers need to arise
Teach me how to rap.
Most humble rapper I know yet a GOAT🙌🏼💯

“Everywhere you look, it’s plastic all fabricated. Everything you seen on TV, was exaggerated. Don’t nobody see you till you get a million followers, and when you do they treat you like you’re someone and you validated.” 1:08
You’re one of the best.

Y’all better like this song
👾👾
We got this shit 200k Easy
this aint bars bro these straight out the whole prison will all the stuff you've been  preachin
Dax,  Wow. Just f@#$ing WOW. New fan here, as a result of this song at this very moment. I've heard of you before and heard only few songs - "My heart hurts" and just before this I watched "Joker" which led me here to "Gotham." I gotta say man - I relate to a lot of what you're saying in your lyrics. To put it bluntly - your shit is deep. I don't know if you actually read any of the comments people write you but if you happen to read this know that your art & your voice is important in ways you can't imagine or possibly see. I don't really know anything about you but as a composer, producer & artist I can tell by your delivery, lyricism & content that you have been doing this sh!t for awhile and I know it ain't easy to get personal on a track but this sh!t feels hella personal. And that's exactly why you have a new fan. I'm excited that amid all the fake, vapid, self-centered "artists" out there that seem to be multiplying like Gremlins and wreaking havoc in the minds and ears and eyes of the people, there are real lyricists and artists out there that are talking about shit that actually matters. As a struggling artist it is very tempting to make and produce content that is commercially viable yet full of sh!t because it is so easy it's laughable and there is a very real demand for it, oddly. (I know you know what i'm talking about.) But when you've been doing it as long as I have the only real choice is to produce and create stuff that is honest and from the heart - even if it remains in obscurity. I'm truly pleased to come across an artist like you who is using their platform to express ideas that mean something & I hope you continue to find success. I'll be bumping your shit in the meantime and looking forward to hearing whatever else you have to say and watching your growth as an artist. Mad props Dax, I know the hard work, dedication, time and sacrifice that goes into following your dreams and it ain't for the weak of heart. We see you, Dog, and you deserve much respect without a doubt.  Thanks for keeping it real and making yourself vulnerable. F@#$ the haters.  - -[Tekorji]
I have never once in my life seen somebody convey such a powerful message and still make it fire. And for that, I respect you Dax.
Hey Dax, I jus wanna say first off this song is straight 🔥. I loved the hook the most, it is really good. But there’s something I want u to know more importantly than that. Ik this might be weird but this song saved me. I want to make music as well and I wanted to go to L.A and now I have second thoughts bout that. And like I said I’m making music and my first one is coming out on 3/21/21. But I’ll go now cuz I think u busy making another banger. But if u need anything or anyone to talk to, all of ur fans are here
Dax to good boss
Been listening to you before you had a million subs dude you have come farrrr such a good rapper idc what none say
BARSsss = DAX
Here for the music and liked for the ps5 😅
#SsoWat☆; STAY 💯 NO MATTER WHAT BE YOU

Strong message, the only person who can save you is yourself. Start today!

Such a great song! DAX is incredible!!
I didnt knew who he was, but i fell in love with his music
If it’s viral it’s fake if it’s not viral then it’s real?
Fake stuff go viral but the real stuff don’t go viral I see because my father told me it’s easy to go down the wrong road but it’s hard to go down the right road
Bro like the vocals when you said living in Gotham living in Gotham
11/24/20 the day I first heard Dax. Damn I've been missin out!
I just wanna have enough money to take care my house and shit
I don’t want to be famous I wanna be me

ITS DAX
Wow great 🔥
This song opened my mind to social media
He is god after liking every comment!
Wow this is so real im feeling the lyrics
2:58 - 3:02 IFKYK Facts
Bro how did I just found this
I don't listen to this type of music but this one... And especially the lyrics...
Dax you are a great rapper u speak the truth all the time good job.
I love your music so much men I hope u follow me on Instagram It will be the best day in my life men you don't understand im big fan since your youtube channel was 200k my instagram is osa_mw love u men keep it up.
the costume look like Travis Scott
@DAX Honestly I found you and this video accidentally and I need to admit not ony you flow and the lyrics, but more important the message you're sending got me directly. To describe it in few words: this song actually is the best mirror of our westen societies. The question is: Why do people want to be famous and own lots of money? IMO it's the ego, which leads you into this swamp of permanent self-comparison & money hunting - because we always want to be better, stronger, richer, fancier etc.  than our neighbor. Nowadays people focus so much on these things they forget the real small nice and lovely things in life and in the end they unlearn to live. But when they realize it (if so) it's too late!!
how are you so real. you make reality look like a toy compared to your lyrics
Damn you smoked that beat
I can feel the song ......love from india 😘em24
This song is something else this man is spitting facts showing how humanity is changing from bad to worse
Yall know dax cares abt his fans cos he puts effort to react in comments if its really him. Keep the work G! Love you doug!✊

real talk bro
He makes such good lyrics about real problems in the world instead of just flexing and being childish
Dax best rapper in the game so underrated
It's Dax!!! 🔥❤️
dax could probably be the most woke and open minded rapper right now
I think I'm officially a fan of Dax. He speaks facts in all his songs
Dax, i love your music, the realist shit ive ever heard, and bro, im litetally telling EVERYBODY! about this song and your others, because someone with your tallent needs to be brought to light!, be safe snd good luck Dax!
Great song ... sounds Hopsin inspired
Hi Dax I'm AJ the rapper from Ghana To me this song is the second best real good music after Royce's Mr Grace in 2020 You went Savage on this one that's for sure
My girl said she didn’t know who you are and now she’s single
❤️❤️❤️🌟🌟🌟🌟
He hit so many real topics in one song and that's the problem with a lot of modern rap is it's the same I'm the best lyrics rather than actual world topics
Hey dax I been listing to ur music since day one u was wondering if y wanted to do a collab
Thanks for keeping me in the rap gang even though I'm trash I absolutely love your productions and rapping/singing
I'm The Fakest Myth, Thats  Lowkey Sick, How Black Men Are Said To Be A Cardinal Sin, Like At The End Of My Life There'll Be  A Screen With 'Fin'.
The most realist shit i ever heard never again will music ever be the same, you changed the game and made these other rappers lame
You're Prince EA the rapper.
Been listening to your music all day. You can add on more fan to the list my man! Keep up the hard work.

Before i listened to this music i ve aaked myself multiple times:  am i a fool for real? I thought i was the only one spendin night looking for answers that nobody else questioned. To those i ve spoken. before, they acted like i  ain't give a fuck ...well now they are sayin ... We are in a puppet mode.  You're not alone
THIS MAN IS AN ABSOLUTE GENIUS
Ive listened to this song on repeat its a banger
Ok Ksi this is actually good
ALMOST 3MIL YALL PLEASE SHARE DAX DESERVES TO BLOW UP MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE♥️.
This is what would happened to dax if he didn't say sorry to tory lanes 😂😂

Dax your soo good at rappin a really want to be like you🙂
Travis Dax is that you?
So fuckin true my brother. If u ain’t famous , u a nobody. Damn its the truth. Glad u sing about life compared to other rappers singing about drugs and money. This a solid song 💯
My favorite rapper by far
This video was lit
I think ur better than KSI at rapping. This is so good.
My favorite rapper’s favorite Rapper. 😎
Okay... I'mma be 100 right now, I'm not at all a fan of Dax, like... At all. But even I gotta' say this song is pretty damn decent. From one rapper to another, good work Dax, you earned it for this one.
Fake shit will go viral, but real shit won't 💯
We want another version feat dan Reynolds
Really don’t like rap. But I like dax!
Dis hit hard dax! love d songs and stories!
Is it just me or if they make a black batman movie should dax be batman
2:15 pause at this time and don’t tell me he doesn’t look like Larry the cucumber
This is why I’ll never be famous
*It's 9:33 P.M. and every siren sounds like a broadcast that only I can hear.*
Your the best man I'm frls
I feel I been tru pain too
Dax is really creative . I first loved his "Joker" single. It was dope. Then I got to know more about the guy. Wonderful to know that a talented rapper out there can focus on more realistic issues than "fake love " that all these others sing most I the time. Keep going Dax. I'm with you till the top(I mean it man).❤👊
Muy buen metodo, mil gracias por el video. A pesar de que ya yo logre reconquistar a mi pareja gracias al sitio web de Desio Altruver (lo tendrías que conseguir usnado googl), simplemente no puedo dejar de aprender de este tipo de videos!
The message is so powerful... I can relate a lot to your music especially, "I Can't Breath" ...we love you (All the Way from South Africa)
Is this hip hop super hero
Video on point @Dax  Keep it up man 😍 🔥
I saw the previous video and this one, your songs understand me perfectly, you understand people perfectly, you are an artist who makes music for people, not for fame, which is why I respect you enormously. Your videos helped me realize what was harder to discover through therapy, your videos are a therapy put on the face of the book.
If i were to be honest, I want to be famous so bad. I cant See my self doing some average job and me being happy in life, I love video games and im trying my best to be different from the rest so i can do what i love as a job.
I swear to god all this mans songs sound the same
I just absolutely love and feel every single word that comes out of your mouth. its like you feel every single thing in your life and you can put it into words. It just amazes me. I just wish people could understand things the way you do. They dont.
DAX is saying everything that is true and when he shaking when he’s right thing is his music is because he knows that everybody doesn’t believe him but it is all true
Most these artists are fake and praise satan and he says he’s shaking when he makes his music is true because the evil government will might try and kill because he knows to much and Travis Scott prasue satan
Every thing Dax he is saying  Is true
Thais Hot!
Hit after hit    It's dax!
MAN, DAX IS LIKE GETTING BETTER BETTER! Amazing❤
This is so good
Hey Dax, just had a question. Would you be ok if I made a remix of two of your songs put together?
Bro nice song😀

ly dax ❤
So much passion. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow! Loving the lyrics 🎧💥🔥🎤🎼🎶💯
This should be song for Dead Island
Happiness is not a physical place you call home, do u ever wonder why u feel like u feel when u take that time away from ur phone?  Why is no one talking about this?
good job bro
It cars if your famous or not don’t ever prove nothing to nobody prove yourself.
One of the best lyricist out rn😂
Clever as hell Dax. Love the poetry and symbolism in the music.
Dax is better than the new eminem
Wow.... just wow 👏
this dude literally the poison he preaches against.  make ya dolla and holla scholla
“I’m Dax-Man”
Dude so awesome more song pls
who else thinks dax is better than ben afleek
This guy deserves more intention then lil pump,69 and all of those shitty rappers
The difference between Dax and other rappers is that, he actually speaks bars while others speak about drugs and shit. This is why I have mad respect for him 🙌!!!!!!!
Dax I just found you by accident on youtube but like wow! Your amazing and the messages in all of your songs is real! Thank you for the hard work and time to make these amazing songs! These are flames!
Dax is the true Batman
"Bat man saves the day" I actually died of laughter 😄😂
Your music goes to a deep deep level in me. I dont know how to explain it. But I just want to say I really appreciate your work.
This track need to be in the next batman movie
BLACK MAN
Man you are really my idol when I hear your song dear God I look forward to the rap songs you made.
Dax? More like Fax Much love 💯🔥
amo este tema...  <3
I've been following Dax since day 1, He never disappoints. His authenticity is  why I'm a big fan
Good man good music Dear Dax👌🏻✌🏼💪🏼
What a joker who knows how to smoke them...I'm suiting up so we can both choke em. Like popping balloons because their too high and unable to breathe cause they ended up traveled on the wrong flight. Take a hike you fucking pike who think they can run off with their bite...nothin' but little tikes with mites.
Yea men🙂🙂🙂💥💥💥💥💙💙💙💙
ITS DAX!!! Honored to have met DAX and your music 2 hours ago Wondered if Eminem has a future muse who maybe  taller though I am a 40 year old virgin to the insanely god sent flow, the fish Emerged after 20 years with 1 verse, renamed it THE  GOTHAM  SHOW!
Dax after this pandemic shit come to harlingen Tx brotha or south padre  island.. Yep deep in the south of Texas
Love you
Love
I dont normally listen to Dax,but this track is absolute fire
You inspire me so much bro. Much love🖤
Can we make this the next Batman soundtrack, this is dope af I can see it now Batman standing above Gotham city while this pure fire banger is blasting in the background
Yo Travis Scott got a burger so when we gon get a Dax burger lol
came from joker, still aint left, your songs are amazing and actually make sense, its not just random stuff and i love it
Can't wait for this year's Christmas song 🎉
Tom Macdonald pt: 2
When he was rapping on the beginning with no beat I got chills 🔥
your outfit is better than travis scott's
Dax has such a powerful voice  and message behind his words they punch thru the vid itself and that I admire
bro, i love your music
Aye Dax, I’ve been listening to you for like a year now bro, and found out about you from your homicide remix and I gotta tell you it was fucking lit. And now you coming out with Gotham which is twice as better. Love your work man keep it up❤️💯 🔥
You speak too bro and you need some good music
This a deep song
F****ing amazing
DAX is the best coming from a lyrics perspective especially
"Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way But I never saw my face in any window any day Now they say your folks are telling you "Be a superstar" But I tell you, just be satisfied And stay right where you are"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4lrjZ1SeOs
Dax sings and raps at the same time, he taking the rap game to another level.
Hey Dax i really like a lot of your songs but this song is the absolute best in my opinion 😀 i also love how Geeky you can be im a huge geek myself and well sadly i went through addiction but ive never been famous  My question to you though is how can you have so many other things in your songs without having to go through copyright issues 🤔
"if you ain’t got a blue check you Ain’t anybody" like fr tho
"What do expect when the dumb people got a smart phone" dax
JESUS DIED ON THE CROSS FOR OUR SINS !!! JESUS IS THE TRUTH, THE WAY, N THE LIFE... JESUS IS AT THE DOOR REPENT HELL IS FOR All ETIRNITY
Best one so far 🔥
guess the 2k+ people that disliked are the "dumb people with smart phones"😜
LESSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOO
your songs are very good man
lol thats Travis Scott
His music is ass
It would be sick if this was in the soundtrack at the end credits of The Batman movie
in every song I listen to by dax he always speaking the truth I can actually learn something from him everyone can just think about it
These comments just prove his message is more real than ANYBODY knows🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Wow I’ve been a fan for like 3 years now the time has flown especially your flow it grew  in a weird way but not like you changed like you put your life into it you know that’s what I like about your music it seems genuinely from your heart unlike some rappers today I see you as a poet spreading messages and inspiration instead of a rapper actually
This is so sick...reality is this song 😥😥🤘🤘🤘
What do you do? How much money u make? Who do you know? what do you drive? Where do you stay?    Love u dax
“How badly do you wanna be famous” you ask  -I don’t wanna be famous I just wanna work hard and make millions somehow without being famous
Daxxx, u are amazing in every way 😍😍
1 year 2 years 3 years 4, drugs alcohol, addiction, morgue.
Selling your soul for fame
Lyrical genius forreal
Underrated
Everything you spit.... Going in hard with hopsin.... Never change, keep spitting what you're feeling and thinking.... all those fuckin haters just wish they were something they can't be, and out of all those... You will always have people who got your back... Genuine and real recognize, stay the killer badass you are, imma still be here banging your tunes!
Damn...this is a must share indeed. Gave me a lot to think about. Thank you Dax 👌💗
Fire
I hope yall know mrbeast commented on this video
Lol I saw this song when it was made a min ago
Those that understand...... Gothem/illuminati
https://youtu.be/_YrvQBYhgug
2pac should’ve made his name 1pac
That hook tho
Notice how Dax makes his songs about how people feel. Suicidal, and they want to be famous. You can't always get what you want in life.
🔥
Its still fire
i've never subscrived so fast to an artist
I LOVE YOU DAX!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ #1FAN
aint it funny that a couple months ago that he made joker
Dax please reach out to fortnite and make a emote i love all you're music and they recently been adding alot of hip hop emote id love to see a superhero dax and just body yall all big S/o Dax ❤ much love
How are the words fact?
Bro te sigo que te vi en una publicación de facebook Edit:tus canciones son poesías
Your raps are insane, don't let people drag you down brother <3
When i listen your songs i always  need to take a minute to think
The difference between Dax and other rappers is that, he actually speaks bars while others speak about drugs and shit. This is why I have mad respect for him 🙌
So this is like a daily thing now can’t help myself
You should expose the holidays. Not everyone knows this but all holidays have a bad and evil beginning. Nobody would listen to me but you got a bigger voice. More people will listen
Daniel iwonsu always spilling fact. Secular  with depth based in spirituality. #voice heard.
Dax Dieing Also Dax: sings
Love this song bro
Anyone else noticed Batman: Under the Red Hood Scene?
https://youtu.be/QKIfsa75pl4
Bro, Dax I would love to see an whole album like this song and Joker that’s would be so sick but good work I love the song and the message
what is this? hip hop? eew   jk, this shit bangs
I get goosebumps listening to your words. Please don't change. God bless🙏🏻🖤
After seeing (and listening to) Joker, now Gotham...i just had to hit the subscribe button. I suggest you do the same; e get why! Thank me later. I love how your creative mind works Dax....damn!
This man is the definition of the word "A R T I S T"  Blessed for this comeback. Don't let 'em win 🙏🏼
Wow so relatable dax is back🔥
Daxman
Idk if you’ll be Tory now tho he carry a strap just watch your feet and you’ll be fine
YEA 🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟 BEST SONG OF 2020
Real talk✌
Big fan from India  Dax is very talented Lyrics are worthy  Keep shining
BREAKING NEWS  Dax has been rushed to the hospital with a broken spinal cord for carrying the whole rap industry on his back.😂🌸
this song deserves 200 M + views and 10 M + likes and 0 unlikes
U still haven't fought KSI
This song is fire 🔥🔥🔥. I like your songs bro. I ain't capping
Straight outta Pakistan
pretty brave after what happend to travis scott
Man your deep. you deserve the credit you dont want, keep your shit up your hella good guy and no one even knows it!!🔥🔥 stay woken fam
I can't say I want to be famous, but I do want to do something worthwhile and fun. I want to be a voice actor. Even if it's a small role no one ever notices, I'd be content. I've no idea where to even begin with that, though. I'm so disconnected from reality, because the last decade has been a fever dream of chaos and I don't know where all that time went. So sometimes, I stream on Twitch for fun and to give myself an outlet to be a little weirdo. I don't have a webcam, or fancy screen animations or overlays. Hell, I barely know how to operate Streamlabs at all, but my channel is starting to do surprisingly well. I'm not gonna plug it. I'm not making a comment to promote myself. But I do fear the idea that I might get famous one day, and my whole life will be on show and I'll have no where to hide. I mean, I just want the fun, not the attention. I know it's an inevitability you can't escape. No public figure can. I've watched a lot of my idols go through some tough shit, and I remember Eminem's "The Way I Am" and how all he wanted was to just be left the fuck alone but people hounded him everywhere he went.  But if someone gave me a chance to get my foot in the door as a voice actor? I'd probably jump on it even though I know what it would bring. That's the cost of following your dreams.
Fire🔥
Why you would be famous with a public showing i would like a to be a famous guy with a hidden face
I like this Dax.....he gives nothing but truth
YOOO DAX YOU ARE THE BEST 👍👍👍👍🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾
The style reminds me of how good rap used to be back in the day - when there was a message wrapped in a story.. with rhymes that weren't just repeating the same last word every line... solid work.
Wishing I could give you hugs!
Hey
@Dax I followed your words your steps and I never got my the link, I’ve been anticipating this day for so long and only noticed today that you sent the links already. Please hear me @Dax! I love your music and the message you spread🤟
Love from india ❤️.
I love your music and it has helped me get through a lot
Awww wowo this is it🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just listen, the only person/artist I know, that speaks real words, his opinions r his, but he makes points and facts! It's DAX
Mano só no fã desse cara Vey se vcs me entende né mas só do Brasil
"living el gatto"  - Dax 2020
I’d like to say, the fight scenes in this are better choreographed and shot then most movies,
I see you
Finally got around to this, goddamn. Straight fire holy hell.
_Its to goosebumps  for me dax_
3:15 😥Enough said "!... ❤
Dax is the goat🐐🐐🐐🐐
Dax makes hella good ass music
Love it
How your not on the Charts yet bro I don't understand
Dax the Realest Legend Ever 🎶🎶👑💖✨
Idk what to say this shit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I see, theire slowing his views like they did to tory lanez track "Most High"
1:17 this flow is so cold 🥶
Dear Dax, I just wanted to thank you for everything you do. Your music makes me happy and you make my days better. I love you so much man. Thank You.
The singing bits be giving off mad Hopsin vibes 🔥
MAKE MASK BRO CORONA TIME

I don't really want to be famous I would just like for life to be a little easier

Killer wanna see this like tho
Yes singing and rapping this song is 😎👍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dax a goat
DAX IN A BAT SUIT IS ALL WE NEED  WE NEED NO TRAVIS SCOTT WE WANT YOU
Man this song is just so underrated like why does it have so little views it should have millions. it just astounds me that people can be so ignorant.
This song is 🔥
It’s nice to hear tracks & actually feel like you’ve gained insight and perspective; most rap these days seems to kill more brain cells than booze or drugs.
“How badly do you want to be famous?”  Honestly never  Never liked being famous and never will
This guy is an artist, WOW!  Is hard to find someone that don't make music about guns, money or women.
Bro I never liked Batman but after seeing this im no fan of Batman but I'm a big fucking fan of Bat-Dax
Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 real ass song!! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💯💯💯
Waiting for next song.!

I want to meet him so bad not to get a picture but to just be in the presence of a true artist please make my wish reality
The only reason I didn’t like you is ksi tbh but ur a hard rapper
This almost made me cry and I'm not even a sensitive person
Respect dude
joe mama
Finally. Real rap with real message. Hello from Romania
FUCK YEAH DAX GIVE ME ENTERTAIMENT ON AN OTHER LEVEL ! THANKS BRUH!
We need more artists, more people in general like you dawg.
Bro, I am super young I am 14 but this helps me so much. Keep outdoing yourself. Keep up the work bro. Much love from Kentucky
Dude you should rap with eminem and logic and joyner lucas
That beat hits different ❄
#AWESOME (LOVE FROM ASSAM INDIA)
Man. I listened to MGK, Joyner, NF, Hopsin, Dax, Chris Webby, TomMcdonald  long before anyone of them were even close to 100 thousand subs.   Now. They taking over the music industry. I'm happy.
THAT'S DAX THE NEW G.O.A.T
Bro I related to this way to hard
Your a goat 🐐.The best groove.Wish to hear you and doobie build a song
Damn. I’m going to be famous one day and I feel like God wanted me to watch this video. Damn. I refuse to be a slave to a world run by criminals. Jesus Saves
I used to want to be famous, but God saved me from going down a treacherous path. Dax, I literally just started listening to your music yesterday and your music has been in my head all day long. The consideration you have for your fans is nothing like I've seen before. You are truly an upfront and genuine dude. If you have a chance to read this, I would really like to share some words of the Bible with you.    We were angels in heaven who sinned against God because we were tricked by Satan. We are now on spiritual deathrow - this is why we have to die. Satan is on this earth too, working in the spiritual world, tempting us and trying to lead us into destruction. The way to escape all of the corruption in this world is by following the truth of the Bible in Zion. I hope you come brother. God bless you! https://wmscog.com/the-soul-exists/
dax please help sing songs for Papua from the Indonesian colonies
dax please help sing songs for Papua from the Indonesian colonies
Clout cobain vibes tbh. This a banger
The most real lyrics ive ever heard , the people who speak the truth get silenced, the fake people get viral
Wow this was an amazing song. It hit deep. It speaks volume. 🥰👏 Keep rising and don't let fame destroy you're inner peace.
I absolutely hate rap music but this crap is awsome
I think DAX and NF need to do a collaboration........both have that same grrrrrr and I love it
1:27 bro read your messages
Dax has improved so much over the past years, now pretty much every song he drops is addictive to listen to now
blasp hemy
the batman part got me on the floor ]
Just found out about you couple weeks ago 🔥🔥🔥👍🏻👹💯🔥🔥🔥
God I would fucking love to collab with you dude  .
I don't listen to this type of genre much, but the songs you do, the lyrics, they got deep messages and I like that 👌👌
DAX 🔥🔥🔥🙏
Gotham got a new hero, its "Daxman" 😁  I'll see myself out, bye
dax man you really did it this time this song crazyyyyy much love bro!! you gonna blow crazy crazy soon and imma be here supporting you the whole time!!
This is the only guy who actually speaks the truth about life. Respect 💯
Stil a better Batman costume then Travis Svot
The fact that he walked away with Dax in his arms like Batman did with Robin in the comic where Joker killed Robin was just GENIUS.
The joker clip wasn't that good
Carries content that weight and worth being #Billboard 1 consecutive months till he drops his next one , and Media should have recommend this more than just in YouTube , cuz MEANING is More important than beats and everything going around
"Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel when you take that time away from your phone"   EVERYONE NEEDS THIS
Pac's legacy lives on............
Jerome Valeska got verification tho
A PERFECT example of Gotham City is in fact Social Media. It's actually sad but true.  Thanks DAX.
https://youtu.be/3dc3m6kBMpU
Sometimes i think Dax is his own breed, his parents didnt make him, he made them🤣
Dax you got respects from Greece bro
You did a song with Izi  it was LIT   🇮🇹❤DAX
If dax can pull of Batman how about black panther
Even after producing masterpiece like this.He is liking each and every comment.Just wow ...You truly respect your fans man...Love you bro❤
Dax you showed me the light bro
Bro love your music keep up the good work bro ima big fan
wheres the lyric personnn
I never knew who you were until ksi talked about you.
"1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4  drugs, alcohol, addiction, morg"  dammnn this was such a goood linneee
I had never liked his music before but this year he proved me wrong by making amazing songs and now he is one of my favorite artists. Love from india
true....
🔥🔥
This song i find on Spotify  and now its my playlist its fire
Reality out Here 🥲 There's So Much On this Track That Just Blows Up In Ears 🔥🤨🔥
Im in love with this song mr.dax
Fire 🔥
lets fuckiiiiinggggggg gooooooooooooo
Dax a Batman fan wow
I'm not really into dax but I fucking love this song
No one can even remember the time before they needed to be attached all the time or at least don't remember that feeling. When's the last time yal turned your phones off just because? Does it still make you feel a sense of security and convenience?
Please Check Your Instagram DM 💜
This reminds me or clout cobain by denzel curry
yoo man your songs are so deep dude some real meaning a real massage sometimes i wish i could sit down for a conversation with people like but distance and time and schedual tears us apart
Hey dax you are very talented and honest we all love your songs i hope you can get to read this thank you and good luck
Dax looks good af in his suit
X 1.25 speed
Dax is a legend and has always been one
I love dax's music because dax always telin story on it... Big up to you nikkah
One take ❤️
I wanna be like you hey dax
Op song
I've played this so much on Spotify and YouTube both already, easily one of my favorites. One thing most people didn't notice, if I'm not mistaken, "happiness is not a physical place you call home" could be a callback to "I Can't Breathe" where he says "I got all this money, I just bought a house, but with nobody in it it isn't a home". I see you Dax! Keep spreading facts and dropping true bangers!
first song i like by dax good job m8
Why tf he's soooo underrated 🥺
Great song like all the other masterpiece you released. Keep the good work up.
Favorite song right now
Did anyone else just realise that Gotham is a metaphor for fame
🌹🥰🌹🥰🌹
I have a trap song it's very good I used to sing dancehall I could still sing but I wanna step in to trap so yes I have a trap song an would like to have u on my track please I could see that your going to kill it
U did it again
“Dax is his own person, it’s DAX!”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj6EmRCo2M8&t=62s
WOOOO THAT OUTRO 🔥🔥
Your telling facts🔥 🐐
"If you need it I will be here in yo head speaking words you’ll need if defeated"  Everyday is a struggle to stay on the path of my goals. What do you do on the hard days to not go astray that day?
Living in Goh. tom..
Hmmm, I never imagined Batman being into rap but if he was, he would definitely listen to this song 😂😂 like think about it, he also wears a mask as Bruce Wayne. But Batman, that's who he really is.
This is why Dax’s is *THE BEST*   But Seriously I love how a lot of his songs have a really deep meaning love your music bro
Fire
I think the people that dislike this video just arent ready for the facts
Jesus christ your a god
1:25 yuuup
Who wore it better DAX or Travis Scott? 😂😂
I want to help others rich or poor
Fucking Needed this again  been a few days
I love this song so much❤️ thank you Dax your songs have saved me and I wish you great success
I love you dax, you're the best person ever and you make the most true songs
Mehn Dax should be the man of the year, his damn good
Hey, if you have questions about God (Jesus) i can maybe try and answer them.
Am your biggest fan from Jamaica. I just want you to keep up your hardwork and let those haters leave behind. I wanna be like you when i grow up. I respect you man to the highest point
Another bloody masterpiece! I love this dc universe theme. Good luck Dax! Love your work
U better than ksi YES...?
This is real music. ( NF IS STILL BETTER)  u are one actual Man who spends time to make a point and not just dropping a song for clout. # nice Batman suit.  ( KSI take some notes)
Wow Dax you are so unbelievably talented , beyond refreshing to hear a rapper now a days that doesn’t rap about stupid shit. Instead you preach about relevant things. Love all your songs  We need more artist like you🔥👌
very good my god this song and very good rap
🔥🔥🔥
This was in my recommendations.   Good job YouTube.
🔥
#dax is back
This and the joker song by dax 2 perfect songs for the new batman game they are making
We need this to be 1 of the songs on the new Batman game like its perfect
if im honest hes a top 5 lyrically cant change
Oh man 🔥😎
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I got to give respect to you🙏. Your talking about some real shit that is going on in our "society" today. even though half the people dont even realize the stuff that your saying and just bop their heads to the music... That saying where the man chose not to follow others paths but chose to create his own for others to follow is you my guy, But we all have to realize that we have our own path carve too. Whether to create a path or to follow one, is up to yourself. I'm 17 and I realize this stuff but other people way older than me cant even see past the bad, the negative, popularity, etc. None of it matters in the end would you rather want to be chained up in popularity or be actually free cause the life we living right now isnt free and hes showing that by him being chained up to the music industry. Ik your probably not gon see this but good stuff😂. this is like a page🤦🏽‍♂️
why didnt batman dax not make it into the ksi reddit, im sad
WOW!!! I listened to one of his songs and I was intrigued, the second song I was amazed, by the third song, Dax had a new Fan!!! Your artistry is absolutely Phenomenal!!!
The dislikes are from dumb people with smartphones
I got beats how much for a feature ❤️🙏🏼
Sad Beautiful Truth of society these days ❤️ Dax is the King 👑
❤❤❤❤❤
This is honestly one of the best songs I've ever heard. The amount of effort Dax puts into his art is amazing including the videos.
deep
Aight were do I start? 1. I left Dax after Faster. Now I'm back cos my mate said to listen. He loses fans and gets em back w absolute fucking bangers. Keep up the fire 🔥🔥🔥💯❤️
🔥🔥🐐 couldn't say it any better. Everyone needs to take a step away from social media.
Grbage

this is amazing. you never disappoint me
Who else noticed that Dax has Reddit?
I think you can be a superhero name Dark Fighter
I don't understand song but it my favorite song
That hard
I think I should binge watch GOTHAM 🤔
DAX should make more easier music I'm naturally a fan because it's new art he is news making but would be more Sympathikus if there s a funny joke like not being crazy but funny
the song is proportionnaly awesome as the video clip is horrible
Dax Wont Heart this.
Y'll know this guy sings at his worst situation.
Oh shii....i fw dis
Keep up the great work dax, your one of the real ones spitting straight truth that cares about their fans! Respect bro

Wow!! Amazing🔥
Why did it take me so long to hear this song. Love the song Dax keep up this shit.
Dope
This is the media and real life explained in a song and I love it thank you dax for returning

Back here again, it’s yo ur boy John aka UB, I’m here just to get a wonderful moment listening to this song and dancing while screaming this song cuz I know that song cuz I listen to this everyday cuz Dax is my fav rapper on earth beside Polo G cuz they make meaningful music and it’s 🔥, love you Dax stay safe and stay Dax ft. Apart 😂 get it? (Dax is 6 feet and you have to stay 6 feet apart, don’t get me, listen to Daxmix- WHATS Poppin) love y’all ❤️
Very true
This is such a powerful message it gave me goosebumps
Dax is the Tupac of our generation. This generation does not want a Tupac but the truth is We need one. And this is him. @Dax
my man, your lyrics are sexy ash
Love the Visuals Dax!
Bro I bet everyone that listens to your music feels a personal connection with you. If not they don't feel the music
Кар ска Кар...

📌🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lo unico que entendi fue *Gato*
I listen to this at least 2 times a day 🔥🔥🔥
He is going through it but it is very  bloody the vedio is very bloodyand critical
Sideshow Bob is that you I didnt know you could rap
I’m a KSI fan, came over to see the trash music but like damn, not only is this deep its actually really good! Keep it up man! Underrated music!!
“They won’t give you no credit becuz they’ll know you’ll use it and that’s what happens when the master starts fearing the student”🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥by far my favorite verse

To Dax THE VIDEO JUST ISN'T SCARY AND MAKES A JOKE OF HIS SIK LYRICS. U NOT AN ACTOR UR A POET AN RAPPER. Do what ur good at an ull sell ur work to a bigger audience.  If im a painter i aint makin a trash movie to show my paintings in ygm be real bro. Not a fake clown  An i dont wanna b rude but the acting is horrible. Get a day job if that was all u had.  I dont wanna c giggs skepta, eminem, lil wayne, tupac in a movie either, an brad pit aint gettin a record label. stick to ur shit my g an ull fly
Dude you are a lyrical genius. Shady better grab this guy while he can.

Dax, Hail Mary- Tupac Remix Would Be 🔥 Keep It Up Family🙌
Man I love this fuckn dude🤘🏻
So I'm part of the circus DAX FAMILY FOR LIFE💪
I totally understand the message, I'm a upcoming Dancehall artiste and I'm not yet hitting a million views but once the fame comes and popularity, it's gonna all change, they fake the love when you making it big...
Just one word GOAT
fire song cant stop listening
Pessoal venho pedir humildemente Que se inscreveram no meu canal por favor É muito importante para min  Quero divulgar mais o meu Trabalho Por favor ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏 humildade acima de tudo
I listen this song everyday like a prayer This track is so dark yet so truth maybe this world is dark maybe
Good song but the lyrics kinda sound pseudo-intellectual if you ask me, yeah a lot of people are fake and just want fame, it's shitty but has been talked to death. However I do like how you used Gotham as a metaphor for big cities that everyone moves to when they become famous like LA in America or Berlin in Germany, it gives the listener freedom to apply it to their location and situation.  edit: and the thing where you give every comment a <3 just decreases the importance of the heart and makes you look like you approve every single comment, which might not be a good look
Telling a whole story in one song. Keep it up bro!
This slaps SOOOO HARDDDD
🔥🔥 fuego
How does he like every single comment??
En un año alguien habrá matado a esta fiera así k seguiré escuchando esta canción y disfrutando de ella hasta que llege ese dia
DAX BRO UR INSANE 🔥  And love ur music
THIS is too sick, bar for bar, just on point. This man and Hopsin inspire some of my writing. This inspired me still.
I need to listen to this again so many bars to catch
One day I will rap with you Bro you’s a real 🐐
Ok let's be true here.... This song is actually good!!
Bro, you are the best artist out there! You are first, then NF...

These bars are so real
Thanks DAX  ❤.... my dream: another by shakur

Still better than travis scotts
Mahn, i wish i was American,  so i could get the chance to meet Dax, maybe spit with him, 😌a boy can dream right
Dax is too good for da rap scene☝

Honestly, I learned more from him than what school taught me
ITS DAX !!!!  Nah but honestly I didn't know I needed this tune bro , so much truth it's unreal , all the way from the UK , next if live you do , ima hit you upp bro
2:12 my favourite part
Dax: Forget me! Save yourself! Bat Dax: Aight. Bet.
Ksi better you have no uniqueness the only people who listen to you are gay, black hair emos, 😂
Boss i love this fire u are putting more grace
Ladies and gentlemen  He has done it again !!!  🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 Dax 😫😫
Idk how im just finding Dax... but I'm thankful I have.
Fucking hell Man U just keep improving I’m about to be a rapper
Damn, i guess travis scott’s batman suit wasn’t the worst ever
Ain’t listen to dax inna while , it feel good to listen to him again
Listening this 24/7 litterally addicted to the song. Greetings from the Netherlands
Awesome beat liké Mozart😍
You've come along way
I like the line " know ones from here but they come here" that just stuck with me
This is so clean n beautiful
Why does dax in a suit make him look british
IS DAX DROPPING AN ALBUM?
Yasssssssss! <3 <3 <3
Bro loved the song and the batman suit but that mask looked stupid af
I started smiling when I seen agent 47

Bro he has suck a good message in this song it’s crazy
Sh*t is so real, that's why I love DAX's music....keep it up BroHa
WE DID IT!!
I can't stop listening to this! I love the lyrics!!
I joined the number but it won't let me
""if you don't got a blue check you Ain't anybody" this is so true
You got them !! On point! Gotham!
Could you make a song about how some people work hard but still can’t succeed
"Gotham vs Joker" would be 🔥
Every other artist keeps putting out mainstream bull with nothing but empty words and a catchy beat but dax hits real issues and kills iy every time! Respect dude, keep up the good work!
Dax u are the best
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
did nobody relise that daxs chains are broke lmao
I had to watch it twice because the first time I was just watching all the action. Now l shall listen to the deep meanings that Dax speaks in his songs ‼️
This is one of the best songs I’ve heard recently
Gotham really thought they had my boy dax beat.. gonna have to do alot better and harder than that
Haha, he really dissed LA like that
One of Dax's best songs
Big up dax the ksi beef really put me against him but for the past couple of months his musics been popping back to back bangers better than jjs repetitive music💸🤜
OMG...Dax is a fucking king🔥🔥...bars ma nigga bars 🔥🔥
That's some God lvl lyrics  👏👏
Man this is sick
Bro every song u make it’s always true no bullshit 🤘🏽
Bruh I realized every time you make a song like this it be all facts
Hamza you said Dax is back....  He never left.. This song is Straight  FACTS and straight FIRE 🔥 🔥 🔥
Man he spitting
South Africa Approves
And people still think KSI is better rapper than this man lol numbers don’t mean nothing KSI just has a bigger fan base and has a lot of artist im his songs that makes his music slightly better.
His back!!! Yea! Been waiting for this 🙏🙏🙏
Literally insane🔥
fire af

Fake plastic tress bleed toxic waste fueled by dimensional aliens physic plasma.

Dax is the best rapper ever! Me and my homie love this dude for his amazing music. Thanks, Dax for helping us both out through tough times
Love you fax😍😍
Awesome Dax I love it  the lyric 🎶 and the vid is going so smooth..😉👌
2 MIL LETS GOOOO
🎧💀🎧🔥🔥🔥🔥⚡💯🔥🔥
DAXMAN 💪
This thin is LIT
Me - *actually understands the music and plays Batman: Arkham City while blasting on my Bluetooth*
Bat dax
WoW this janitor Raps pretty good
II'm from the Czech Republic and Dax is a legend for me, he deserves to be on top and maybe even more, because in the Czech Republic "rappers try to imitate rap" and I'm ashamed of it, but Dax is the only one who has the crown he really deserves! Whenever I'm sad or I feel alone, all I have to do is play his songs and everything disappears at once ...  Thank you for what you do and for the opportunity to listen to a legend like you in the Czech Republic! It's dax!
Nice
I don’t really like him but this is a banger🔥
Make a new song
This is mad
I don't know what to say except that this song is awesome and not only the song, also your acting skills and the message behind it. U did a good job.
I love your music, brotherman. It is spiritual poetry, I'd say.
I agree with Dax everything it’s just becoming a meme I don’t understand it. It needs to stop everything isn’t a meme there is reality outside of all the memes   Anybody feel me
I mean he's basically a bitter rapper. I can handle a bit but not a whole album. It's like listening that joyner album. Dax can make happy music too. I hope he makes a song called emerald city to about out the green laterns.   Dax been getting traction but with the corona he ain't gettig on the ground with fans. don't get too bitter bro
We love you Dax best in the game 🤍
That's amazing rhyming 😎😎😎
You maybe not learn french but merci pour tous tes son sa sort des tripes ta de l'humour malgré notre monde bravo a toi continue comme sa te laisse pas avoir par le succès ou l'argent! Vrai 4 ever!!
"..What do you expect when dumb people got smartphones.." Damn i felt that! 😑🔥🔥🔥😑
Just commenting 🙃 for engagement
AT LEAST HE WEAR A T-SHIRT ..LOVE YOU <3
Dax already done Joker and Gotham, now I’m just waiting for either Batman or Robin 🔥🔥
DAX IS BAX AND ITS BETTER THAN EVER, FAX 🔥🔥🔥
My boyfriend introduced me to this and I love This!
You are on fire 🔥 #ItDax
i hope u never reach high fame so that we know your musiz stays the same. it is terrifying if we lose you to the industry
Why this song has only 2,3 mil views while it should be like 30mil
"False prohepts  on these screens everywhere we go but what did you expect when dumb people  got smart phone"🎖🔥wins it all!
Is Dax ✊
IT'S DAX!
dax is a lit rapper but his singing..... damn❤️
Mentality is powerful. See your goals, write down your goals, visualize it, then make your move to get it. Keep in mind the only consistent person in your life is you, and remember that with success comes failure, people walking in your life and leaving you too, all you’ve got is yourself.
Dax is the GOAT. Gotham and joker are my favorite songs of all time keep goin man hope to hear more from you man 🐐🔥💯
"If your fragile dont you even gonna come to this place, they gon build you up and break you and rebuild you to break"
I tried not to watch this video because I knew it would be my new obsession, & I was right.
Dax we love you from India
You should of put "many people arnt from here but many people come here then all of a sudden get rich and old and sell there sole and die of an overdose"and then the Gotham part
ITS DAX!! 🔥🤘
This comment is a time capsule back to when Dax had 2.7 Million subs on YouTube

This is damn good!
Birthed into drama, broken by the trauma, then drugs, alcohol, addiction morgue!
It hit hard when u were carrying urself. Ur your own Batman. love u man
The one we must truly seek validation for is ourselves first and foremost. Cuz only then you don't need to jump into the bandwagon when you don't want to or hate to just to stay relevant. One message from me, for those whoever read this, you're awesome. You're cool. Don't ever lose your identity or your preferred lifestyle just because those big names dictate what is best.   Keep doin' what you doin', Dax. I discover you from your Dear God song. You're a great rapper, song writer and artist. Wish you luck. And wish me luck also.
Bro nice job love ur music and music vids congrats on 2mil
This is a banger though he says Gathom but I dont mind that

Dax is different. Legendary!!🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My brother asked me to listen to this song a few minutes ago. He asked that i really listen & said he wanted my honest opinion.. telling me he had something he wanted to actually discuss, is what I knew he meant. 🙄Okay. Fine. Whatever. He knows I really dislike this genre of music, for one. Even the blend I would rather consider this to be.. all of it. Not my thing really. But it's not on my "play that shit & I will burn your face off while holding the match with my teeth" list. That award, primarily, goes to anything country. And I'm of the generation who constantly heard "do u want me to give u something to cry about!?" So im.. yeah.. I don't have the patience. I give my brothers new like a listen because, at least, it isn't the same guy he's been on about for weeks on end & who I used to really like until my brother got ahold of it.🙄 I usually listen to ppl who the world hasn't yet heard of because I'm bored. I don't have twitter, instagram or any of that (snap but only because i won't give the kids service & i can monitor their every move, deleted or not). I like things that are controversial, clever, thought provoking.. i really like things that make me jump to one emotion or another until you give it a listen or 2 & it's not what it seemed. Or maybe it speaks to both sides of... (something no one does anymore because one of us is right and the other should be flogged) idk. I don't listen to music much anymore. Mostly news. I like stories. Real stories. People's stories. Not the crowd that's "woke" or right, or who can admit they were wrong, not the ones who are 1/16th Cherokee/blk/hispanic/white (whatever pc thing they need in the moment). I like stories that don't end with blame (unless it's to recognize our own so that we csn do something about it, not true- we can't and we dont even almost want to either)..  All of this to say, what u wrote here.. in this.. is none of what i find anymore. After the 1st 15 times thru it is.... So much of what it isn't. And almost exactly as it shouldn't be. I really enjoyed it. And now that I'm aware that you exist I very much look forward to listening to you further
Actually one of the most rewatched music video on YouTube and Spotify
Amongst the best rapper.....i appreciate u Dax. From Tanzania 🇹🇿
I think I've been watching this music video too much
“.......but what did u expect when dumb ppls got smart phones” bruuuuuuhhhhhhhh🔥🔥🔥🔥
+$!✓DAX = FAX✓!$+
Shit, boy! That's exactly what happens right now in our life! And it is not even in your country, it is EVERYWHERE. I love that song so much, 'cause it slaps me right in my face and makes me do the right things! Big love from KZ)
I love this song so so much
The dislikes are the labels because their secrets were told.
Can you diss lil pump?

years from now we will look back on this.  And when we have children tell the young generation about this.  The ones willing to listen ..
Thanks Dax 🌏❤😭😭
DAX just gave us the definition of what our generation is like now😪
I don't want to be famous I just want to be known as a youtube to make people's days and put a smile on people's face known as a real youtube and not no fake YouTuber. Also, good song Dax been up on you since the first diss track on everybody.
I'm love batman and I love this

Used to be a fan before this masterpiece, now I'm a whole air conditioner
Incrível 👏👌
Good on you! This song is so good, and the lyrics! 👌
This hot garbage no cap
Don't Tell me you don't have part 2 for this
First its Joker second its Gotham .. whats next batman??
These are type of songs that need over 500 million views..
“Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are his delight.” Proverbs 12:22 The world reels so many lies it unbelievable; they just wonder how much fame they can get out of you😔😔
Back here again, listened to this a couple times a day, bout 70 times this week, Dax is powerful ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ Imagine Dax face time me🥺🥺☺️ ig @j_ubfrmrss24
Dax is one of those people who dose not make a bad song
Is your favorite superhero Batman
this brother never disappoints his fans. am proud to be one
Can't stop listening to this.
Fakes real, and they say real is fake woke. Fire out the gate been a fan since your early 2pac videos love the topic of mental health. Keep it up big bro
Dax:"Fake shit goes viral, we know this won't." Also Dax:*Has 2.2M views*
2.5k likes are from people that want to be famous BADLY
Dan Blizerian needs to hear this 😝😝😝
Can we learn from this song and not treat eachother like this? Talk to each other in person. See people for their character and personality rather than net worth
Its officially my favorite song of dax😎 wheres the janitor reference and its dax😢
I love you Dax!.
DAX WE NEED Wack A Rappers 3, you have 103K likes on the second and you said you would make a third at 100k, you dont have to but i would enjoy it kinda been ey balling the likes once in a great while, i flipping love your music, if you dont want to it is perfectly fine just keep dropping these bangers, rock on dude
Dax you got my vote for your music I'm very glad you make interesting music Much love ❤😎
Travis should have asked Dax where he got his batman costume
Anyone else notice Dax took a page out of Eminem’s book
DOPE DAX KEEP IT UP
What’s the point of being famous if people don’t love you for you. Dax is like a brother/friend in my mind. The older sibling who gives advice through music.
This is about the 50th time I’ve listened to this and it just gets better every turn! In my book you’re forever a legend 💯
🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯
Dax i like your voice, It has weight.
I remixed this song! Can you check it out?
Desiigner updated lyrical and understandable bar spitter version
i listened to this 30 timesss in a row damnn 😳
Spread this and joker on my Facebook page today. Such powerful messages I feel that people should hear. Keep it up Dax!
I don't usually listen to rap, I'm into metal and country, but this one was awesome! This song speaks my mind lol
Somethings needs Double Like Buttons, like this one..
That's what i'm talking about! That's what people need. Appreciate you man, this is high and deep in the same time, great work I can agree what you said.
Back here again, I’ve share Gothem to another 175 people and shared it to my story ❤️

WHEN I HEAR THE WORD RAP I ALWAYS THINK OF DAX
I like your song, I'm from Indonesia
my favorite rapper at the moment .. you deserve much more views and a fan ... you will soon be the best rapper in the world ... if you are not already.
Thinker
This is tough 🔥🔥🔥
"I have been antiviolent but don't push me cuz I just might do it,they will not give u no credit cuz they know you gon use it,that's what happens when the master starts to fear his student" That whole thing meant more than what meets the naked eye
I seriously can’t keep up with ur dope shit. I’d prefer more time to study each song but u spit them out like under cooked chicken! Quick Fast
THANK YOU DAX FOR LIKING THE COMMENT , I LOVE YOU LEGEND , LONG LIVE THE KING.
They told me dax is giving heart to every comment 🙄             I don't think 🥺🥺🥺
🔥🔥🔥
You are a legend, this song definitely must by played at schools
Love how Dax went from Joker to Batman
so much truth
*I N C R E D I B L E   W O R K*             *Good Words*  *LIKE HOW MICHAEL JACKSON* *WORKS*
Yo i want to be a rapper can u shout out my youtube rap name it ain't good audio cuz i used my phone and i need a mike
MAN HAS SAVED HIMSELF PROUD TO BE A SUPPORTER
Man... I'm wordless. I'm from Brazil and few rappers here talk about what you talk. Yo man, you're a fucking monster in lyrics. Hope  this track reach many ppl as possible and open their mind about our reality. One more legend to say the real truth. Gz bro
More memes
He copied travis scott but better
Hate him or love him he has talent and you can't deny that. Credit where credit is due
Hey dax do you respond?
Legend has it that he is still liking comments to this day -someone in 3029
Suberp mann!! You are outstanding 🔥🔥🔥.your rap made my day. Love from India ❤
Dax is the future
My favorite rapper
Been listening to all your music for the past little bit tonight, and You say some of the shit that goes on in my head that I dont think anyone else in the world would ever even consider, you're an answered prayer man, dont ever stop what you're doing. I needed everything you have to say, whether it was 2 years ago, or a week ago. Thank you
fax they dont care about u only if u have a blue check or ur rich thats the sad thing
Man Dax is back with heat
Love all the small Easter Eggs in this that I KNOW people have not caught on to like the fact that the newspaper at the end has some very relevant side columns and the fact that not only is Dax saving himself but the Jokers  in this video could also be tied to his actual Joker video where Himself is his biggest critic so he isn't just saving himself but he's saving himself FROM HIS OWN SELF.  This can literally speak to so many different people but at the same time I'm sure is very personal to Dax at the same time.  True genius my dude! Just make sure you don't try to cater to everyone is future videos as you get bigger.  STAY TRUE TO YOU
Ay petition to turn this into the next batman game soundtrack/opening music
I cant stop listening to you #Dax .. Id love that signed gotham pic!! Hit me up!!
Daxxxxxx killing it again
My favorite Dax song
First he was the joker now he's Batman! This song speaks the truth and I'm glad we got Dax out here speaking the truth 💖💯   Dax reminds me so much of my dad, my dad always tells me the same things Dax says in his songs. If my dad where here right now he would definitely love this song and all of Daxs other songs. 💖💯
insanity brah, true words and meaningful lyrics  keep it up!
Hi how have you been bro?
First JOKER now GOTHAM  I’m expecting BATMAN NEXT
Makes so much sense from milwaukee love
Omg dax
Your a king
Chicken

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Todos hablando del batman cafe de travis scott y nadie admira la maravilla de representacion que hace dax
I came here from Alex Hefners channel. Realist rapper since eminem and NF. Keep it up Dax!
You sooo good i love this song😍😍

ITZ DAXXX
This is really hard!

i love u bro 💔❤I wrote a message on Instagram❤ by:. high xanxiety
Really love the words your saying here really love this big fan
Bro that hit different
fucking fire and a way better bat man costume then travis
GOTHAM😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dude I would love to just have like a personal interview with dax. Just learn about what he knows, where he came from exactly and like shit he’s seen and the behind the scenes of everything. Bc I’ve always wanted to become a “wealthy” musician. Just want to make a living doing it. But then I hear this and wonder if it’s worth it.. while watching dax himself do it (living being famous)  but then see him talking about this. Just makes me wonder. Confusing at times to see someone famous keep talking about this type of stuff. But very interesting and curious.
That course just makes the song so much better
🔥
Better than Most rappers
HEATTT
It’s so (for me) hard to believe this came out a week ago
OMG 2, 547 who watched  this actually got hit by the lyrics.
Damn
So proud of you man keep it up 👍
Keep going dax much love Bro
From Sierra Leone and i love this track to the moon 🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's dax!!!!😂
Each time I listin to this music I always feel great
And they tell you how to behave, when to get upset, how to think, what is okay to say, what isn't, how to be the version of 'you' they want but never letting you be the *you* that you want to be. It all starts with brainwashing from the mainstream and social media, until you are so far gone you are defending the exact institutions that have poisoned your minds.
This song is actually really good
Do a collable with b.o.b and hopsin....💣💥🔥
Only the people who still sleep won’t get the True message 💯
Who else here does like not only Dax's song but also his acting skills? Respect Man👏
I don't know why this nonsense rap got more fame meanwhile this person spitting facts and he's underrated like wtf
So real. So raw. So fresh it cleanses my palette from the nasty taste of the sold out thug off my eardrum and now you in my heart. Stay smart. Stay breathin. Enjoy all four seasons.
Yesss I LOVE THIS SONG ITS SOOOOO TRUE 🙏🏼🙌🏼❤❤
great video
such a amazing song how does it not got 3 mill views
This song is insane wow
Dax, you are my idol. Your lyrics are beautiful. I like to say I’m good at rapping and a lot of my friends say I rap and have lyrics like you. Anyway thank you for changing my life( in a good way )🙏🏽💯
I pray that God protect you Jax🙏we can't lose a Goat🐐like you
Why is Dax’s hair the coolest thing ever
How badly do you love dax?
I keep listening to this song I think about it alot and it's just help so many people good job Dax

This is the fucking truth !
Made a new account to subscribe
“Everything you look is plastic all fabricated, everything you see on tv is unvalidated” deep
Fake sh*t gets viral but this won't.
Love it Dax!  Well done!
Here from Alex Hefner’s video!!! So happy to see more and more people discovering your masterpieces ❤️
Chicken
He is one of the best but just underrated
Love your music, never heard anything as true as this.
Dax is the most underrated woke. Rapper In the game and people really sleep on him smh I don’t think we’ve had a woken rapper like Dax before and that’s why he gets so much hate. Because he does his own way of music. To me he should be very respected In the game. It’s just like with Uzi and NBA🤷🏾‍♂️
Relatable
rappers like this dont win grammy or hardly won awards cos dey speak nothing but the truth.... PAC NAS big examples... DAX. JOYNER are the  few rappers i listen when i feel like listen to new skool rap...
its crazy how on almost all of his songs, the comments are talking about how amazing the meaning of the song is, when the majority of artists have idiotic comments
This belongs in suicide squad it would fit so good or it would fit in a tv show
Oh shit. This is why tried to diss this guy...
Check out his old music like the Tupac mixes and stuff.
Totally mad fire 💯💥
I didn't want to be famous, cause I'm scare that people know me and murder me or some sh*t
This is true .... https://youtu.be/eqNHnKaslEk
I cant stop listening to this, been stuck on it since it came out
Aight I may be too late to comment this but Dax is one of them philosophical poetic rappers who make their music so vividly imaginative. May you live forever Dax! #Wearethelabel
Jus got a question 3-4 years ago Dax made Cash me outside..... is that beginning?
My god he’s back🔥🔥🔥
what a beautiful piece of art <33
I was a janitor
I feel like Dax is watching Batman too much
Going for 3M views soon🔥💪🏾we are the label keep pushing Dax
it's good to have youu back dax ur still blasting some good tunes
I feel like this music will be in the Batman movie (Robert pattison)
You and Tom McDonald are my #1 rappers y’all Should get together and make an awesome song please
Real spittings 🔥
Dax for the new batman song 😬
The GOAT of motivational music 🙏🙏
Best Line " One Year, Two year, three years ,four drugs Alcohol Addiction Morg."........

DAX:One of the rappers who keeps speaking to  existence and reality  Respect🙏✌️

Can someone tell @dax  #dax I watched Gotham 6 times a day, I shared to all my friends and I made sure they all downloaded it. Instagram handle,    Mayoremaar
U have talent but stop making all these enemies
The creation of this song is really unique and awesome Dax game is going crazy
People will tell you they love you without knowing you. I just want to say I appreciate you and the content you put out. I'm sure the mental fortitude needed to stay sane and humble is difficult and I hope people recognize the work you're putting in to keep other's from falling into the cycle. Great job!
This is so fire you are a awesome rapper you real and that's what i like about you and you flow
Dax music be better when he getting in the feels🚫🧢
Came over from Alex Hefner's channel to see if we can get them lost 4 minutes of Joker. Solid interview. Stay humble.
This is better than tiktok and bella poarch.
RESPECT🔥🔥🔥
I swear this guy gives me tupac vibes. Killed it bruhh🔥🔥🔥
dax has one of the most loyal fan bases he has around 2.8 million subs and gets on average 2 million views per video
“Gotham” let’s see #1 song to relate to, should be #1 trending.. keep it up Dax i’m willing to bet i’m your biggest fan if not close.. you inspire me more than any body you showed me you need no one to pursue your dream
I didn’t like you when I found out bout you from KSI not because u dissed or coz I’m a ksi fan but the reason was because you compared you’re self to Eminem and mentioning ur a janitor but now I slowly like you I like some of your songs like Joker,Dear God, My heart hurts, and now this 1. Keep it up I’ll sub because I actually like your songs now. You definitely are one of the best rappers on this platform
Your a no body if you don’t have a blue check : facts
that chorus wasnt it at all, and the song still slaps, thats how hard the bars are
Can we all take a moment to think about how fucking great that chorus is? I mean honestly that was amazing
Dax I look up to you I’m only 13 do you have any tips for life I love your songs also tips in general. I love you bro ♥️💛 You NF And EMINEM are my favorite. Could you subscribe if not I get it it will just be a dream come true
One thing 🔥
So good! Dax songs always giving me the chills. And this video is unbelievable 🔥
And how badly do you want to be famous
Dax this song is full reality
*Hey DAX*, I come up with good ideas! I've got some 🤯 *ideas* for you 😏. *6 words*: **SPIRIT, JESUS, AVATAR, CULTURE, POINT OF VIEW, & SUPER POWERS**... Just a hint, it would be really nice to see you implement these in your music videos. (Especially if you just start walking on water and like water bending or parting waters or something. The idea of you minipulating something like you've got powers would be AWESOME 😉😎👍)  [ *From: Dragon - Hope you like the ideas* 👍]
This song hits hard
I thought about trying the media thing , have some sort of voice and art form ...but unfortunately I studied I guess wrong old Dusty books and saw OH shoot they run stuff ...I'm fragile , I knew nah unfortunately got the game without trying to play . Thank you again , you speak for many wanting to scream it all at the moon and Sun till it changes . But unfortunately nothing new under the sun or moon ...keep up the good fight , from bottom of heart we need people like you willing to buck the wind and trends to give some real talk now more than ever .
Bro you could change gotham with the name of any city in italy and it would be the same, sad thing
I hope I win the insta give away I just got out of the hospital and this week will be a lot better if I do
I'm with you Dax, from Angola👊❤
Make a song with Chris Webby
Buts it's amazing song
This song mekes me cry

yud
This man is legend, if yall cant see that your blinded 🙏
Dax i did what i needed for the giveaway please look for my entry
Just wish I would get notice by people 😭😭💔💔😢😢🥺🥺
💯💯💸
This goes deep into following yourself instead of trying to be like others that aren’t truly who they look like, the eyes judges and the mind is the base of action but let go of that thought and just be the action, true freedom is being free from thought and memory ⛅️. . Hanging with real ones will uplift, people want the reward but doubt the journey but when the reward comes they’ll desire superficial standards. The song was 🥶❤️👁👁.
OMG GUYS ITS TRAVIS SCOTT!!!!! Nah fr tho this fire keep it up bro
This song is speaking facts great job Dax!🙏🔥
I don't wanna get emotional. But his lyrics are what improve my rhyming scheme
Im coming from Alex Henfers reaction
Damnn....
"what did you expect when dumb people got smartphones" DAAAAMNN!!!
2:42 that's a nice hurricanrana
The amount of times ive shared this is beyond me. Everyone needs to see it
Thanks for dropping by Alex Hefner’s channel! So cool hearing you talk about your music and I’m a gigantic Batman fan and love this and Joker! So good! Awesome work!
I almost cried hearing this
The line happiness is not a place you call home is quite clever considering the deeper philosophical implications within the line. Very reminiscent of Camus' Myth of Sisyphus essay conclusion with imagining Sisyphus happy.
Hey I came from Alex Hefner's video of you and him reacting to this song by the way I love this song your really good
2 million hell fucking yaaaaa
dax you're getting way better, keep it up man

Dax never disappoints, keep up the good work bro, love your songs.

I didn't know Dwight Howard makes songs
Thematically reminds me of Post Malone’s song ‘Hollywood’s Bleeding’ but wow this is incredibly well written
Dax has the potential to be a good rapper but why does he have to make these corny ass videos
one of my favorite song ever👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Your very woke Dax, I haven't watched ur video's in a year or so but I see your growth..... Love this bro

Finally ge had a hook
Dax answer this you said everybody comes and you lose their soul cuz I can't control is that a coincidence or just answer I don't know what to do just saying is it a coincidence
Travis Scott got some competition
To believe this is the world rn
Man you got my sub this shit is real hard and spitting some realest facts
This is why I want to disguise myself as a transgwnder and transracial transaccent (is that even a thing) translangual vocaloid producer without actually being a vocaloid producer
No words flor this 🔥🔥
the prince ea of hip-hop.
I'll sub when he changes his hair.
How can I hear about this artist for the first time now? Awesomee😵🤩
Im late to comment, but I've never wanted the fame with youtube or streaming, I just wanted to help those that feel hopeless like you did for me dax. To know someone is going through depression too, and it can be beaten.  Thanks for another track Dax
Like all his music is like a Master Piece Art like the Beautiful Mona Lisa and He's the Modern Leonardo Da Vinci
Blue tick changes everything 😅😅😅😅
You're my new favorite rapper. Refreshing to see someone bear their soul in a time where it's more acceptable to show the lack there of. Love yo shit dude. Live it.
All the people that dislike this they are haters they are just mad that they are 1 out of millions that are dumb people who got smartphones
Holy Shit I didn't realize how bad I needed this. Thank You Dax you're the rapper we dont deserve
Yet not a single bad song yet👍😂
I called DAX a fraudulent at first. I may be wrong
Its about timeeeeee, glad to have you back Dax, this one was amazing :)
Yo my boy Dax 🔥🔥🔥
I love Dax !!! Even my mom likes Dax's songs
The time you took for your self was really worth it bruh
It's soo sad, this is the world we live in now 😔
I don't know how many times I should listen to this for me to be okay .... It really sinks deep into my soul 🔥🔥🔥 Dax is the best
Batman: doesnt kill people Dax: lets make a giant explosion after i get out of the building :D  He is DAXMAN
That hook man <3
2 Miele yeahhh
It's dax I'm playing it again and again ghee take it easy and get it self something nice
Is no one going to talk how the video is in 4k lol
The only song that describes society rn
Everytime you make me realise word unique is more unique
It's been months since I left social media This song add more confluent not to go back  It's really hard to live in this masked world
New Subscriber please,how can I be famous??
Fact- It's impossible to get heart from DAX😔
I don't see you rapping. I just see you spitting real fuckin FACTS man . I love you man . Don't fuckin stop ever. Love you ❤️
its crazy how this beat tokoyo revenge when his song was made  2 months ago and this was made a week ago and it has 2 mil views already
My man dax✌️this is your best song ever💯🙏 respect from india
First seen you on Tech's tour in CA, have been listening to you on and off. You're talented man. I see progression from your songs. Regardless of how people feel about you, you have talent. Thank you for making music with meaning. I appreciate your music man. Wish you the best and more success your way!
THIS MIGHT BE 15TH TIME I AM LISTENING TO THIS SONG! IT IS JUST SO GOOD! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK MY MAN DAX!
Gotham is a metaphor for our modern world, our fucked up society. Great artist.
“Fake shit goes viral, we know this won’t” damn Dax
"But what did you expect when dumb people got smartphones?". damn, this generation needs him for the rapping world, lyrical and charismatic.
"You wouldnt know real if it slapped you right in the face"   On GOD
He just keeps getting better and better.  Never really heard him sing before but it’s really good.
Calling out the deep state. Love seeing a famous person not being a puppet for there propaganda.
He was spitting straight facts
Let's keep this song playing make it VIRAL! This man deserves it! Self Proclaimed
ayy @dax finally heard the first diss against you, it finally popped up. filled in some holes for me in your music, and had a baffling thought. they call it end game? but do they even study chess?   pawning forward and taking on the black knight standing in front of them, only to have your queen come to their square? as they say she lay, i say check that mate, they blundered. couldnt see the future, but way to turn it into a gambit.
I love you so much no more brakes  please
Gotham its all the world right now
💯 💯 💯 Gotham is fr fire keep grinding big d (That sounded so wrong)
Your lyrics man dax your awesome ❤️
🙏🙏🙏🙏respect
Dax the only rapper in the game that can get a message across like this the way he did
I love how your so real with what you say 😶
Dam bro

i make so many songs just to get fame. i know im not gonna get famous but this song just shot me down.
The realist out there 🙏🏽💯
What gave u the ide to name this gotham
Gotham: code word, Instagram and uh any other social media that involves verification checks for people.
“They gon build you just to build you, then rebuild you to break.” Masterpiece.
I’m just letting you know your music changed my life, and helped me get through my depression. I don’t know if you will ever see this or not but thank you
Hey Dax, I am a big fan, it would mean a lot if you could see if I'm trash or up to par. Your bars are highkey some of the best in the game. I'm just trying to come up.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opUoVkMc6-E&feature=youtu.be
can we please get @Hopsintv , he can be Robin :D that remix would be fuckin lit!!
THIS IS ART !!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Everything dax says is the truth when your famous everyone treats you different they just want a picture and if you do not got that verification sign then your no one
Replayed tons of times, glad you hit that 2 mill bro

Dax is literally the best rapper keep it up dude
Dax I fucking love you:)
Don't know if anyone caught onto this but the way dax is carrying himself as batman at the end is very similar to when jason Todd's aka his 2nd Robin "dies" and batman carries his body out. Idk if that was on purpose or not but pretty cool

Thank you for opening my eyes about what’s really going, countless people have sold their soul seeking fame and money. They don’t want us to know the truth so they try blinding us and distracting us. “We know what is wrong and we know what is right But Satan is strong, God And most of your people are losing the fight”-Dax
Ok dax I'm done he bought a freaking batman suit give him some kreed like man is a God dax you make me happy cus you a god

Very wise man...his bars raw ❤️
Your a great person Dax, not many other musicians speak like this and your'e my new influencer to be someone without leaving anything behind. Thank you
So i just need to here it 22k times. so we get 2 million 👍🏿
Dax is legend that kills everybody it’s sad bcz his tryna keep the peace to help save it’s a problem in Gotham when we got a bottom imagine it’s fear of a puppeteer that tells you that your more when your actually Our More then what the joker thought, you are you, his Saved Child from Gotham that has the Riddles down and the Jokes ready to fire
We wanna listen The other minuts of joker !!!!!
Save yourself, people. THAT is how you can save the world.
I like spiderman
Dax man, My names Justin,  Ignore the name an pic this is my beautiful wifes account, I'm m living in a personal hellscape fit for a War criminal an I'm 33 Days into my 1st real attempt at Fully Recovering an being a real man. I was framed for a Crime 3 weeks ago by an old landlord who illegally evicted us but threatened me with jail, I had nowhere to go so I hung around they got sick of it set me up and took me 2 weeks to prove my innocence. Before I went in my wife actually did the residential program so when I came out I came along to nothing leave me alone and living a life like this here completely alone already because drugs are your best friend they allow you to talk to people when they don't give a s*** what you have to say now I can barely ask somebody how they're doing without feeling like I'm causing them too much trouble I think about leaving his world everyday and the other day I almost did while I know damn session I was trying to suit myself up to do it. IN GOTHAM CAME ON AND REMINDED ME OF HOW EVERY TIME I THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR CAREER AND YOUR LIFE AND YOU WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE LEVEL OF INTELLECTUAL AWARENESS YOU HAVE THAT I'VE ALWAYS STRIVED FOR AND I KNOW IT TAKES WORK IT DOESN'T JUST COME BUT RIGHT NOW I FEEL SO ALONE AT THIS END RIGHT WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW WITH PEOPLE ALL AROUND IN SCHOOL FOR HELP AND NO ONE THIS IS A LONG SHOT BUT IS THERE A POSSIBLE WAY I COULD TALK TO YOU, MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY IS IN A WEEK SHE'S GOING TO BE THREE AND I'VE NEVER MET HER I WANT AT LEAST BECOME A GOOD MAN, SO MY FATHER-IN-LAW CAN FINALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH LETTING ME TRANSITION INTO SEMI FATHERHOOD WHICH I'VE ALWAYS WANTED I NEED YOU MAN OBVIOUSLY I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO. BUT I AM INTELLECTUAL ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEVELS IN SO ARE YOU BUT WE'RE ON DIFFERENT LEVELS IN YOUR WAY BEYOND MY POINT AND IF I WANT TO MOVE IN ANY DIRECTION IT WOULD BE AN HONOR AND A BLESSING TO CHANGE MY LIFE AND BECOME HALF THE MAN YOU ARE, BUT PLEASE CONSIDER.. CHANGING EVEN SAVING A LIFE AND YOU NEVER KNOW I GET THRILLS OUT OF SAVING PEOPLE SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY THIS PAIN IS SO HIGH WHEN NO ONE WANTS TO JUMPING THE FIRE WHEN I NEED THEM TO. Just to let you know I've been walking around the city homeless with a broken leg and I fell two days ago and had no phone and was screaming for helping nobody came and I did that for hours until I fell asleep and I woke up this morning two days later the first thing I did was let everyone know I was okay and then come on YouTube to listen to this masterpiece of the song it is literally my favorite song ever I've never ever asked anyone to do anything like this I never even comments on YouTube I feel silly but right now I'll dress up like a clown to be the best man I can be for myself and my family. My number is 401-696-5488 text me call me I don't have any social media except for Facebook messenger you can find me at  J u s t I n  S a v i e n g s a c k. Showing a little support me morally spiritually getting high since I was 13 with zero support I'm literally learning to go through puberty and all that stuff all not all over again for the first time I don't remember growing up I don't remember anything I'm basically not even human anymore
Let's go 2 million!!! Almost!
Let's go 2 million!!! Almost!
He estado escuchandote últimamente y me enamore de tus canciones son increíbles Saludos desde República Dominicana
Holy shit
Respect to DAX for being one of the best lyrical rappers out there ❤️ he's the one of them we all need.   Lot of "rappers" today are just mumbling nonsense shit. But you're built different, Dax. And it's a good thing. Love you ❤️
Imagine being pinned by the best rapper
Dax is so good, I watched this 7 times already.
Imagine how grate a song would be if he collabed with eminem🤯🤯
hi
You have amazing potential and these lyrics were so true and it opens peoples eyes to show them what life is really like. All that with a flow of beats and some bars.
I think that most of the rappers should learn how to write lyrics like your lyrics  It's not just a song it's more than  This song is the best song I heard ever ❤️
Favorite line of this song is: "False profit on these screens everywhere we go but what did you expect when dumb people got Smartphones"❤❗
hes like black hisoka version
Absolute firrree🔥🔥🔥
You've got great Lyrics!!! Keep up. 🔥
Dax One of the most successful  rap❤❤
nice dax ur in my top ten bro
You're my new fav artist ❤️ glad that i discovered you
Congrats on the 1 mil on Instagram dax!! I missed the live stream because I was at work would of been cool to stop by and say hi. Going to listen to this song now.
He is only the musician who lives in reality and makes lyrics that actually people like Fun fact: The dislikes are from the "Dumb people"
So refreshing to hear new music that sounds good and has so much substance to it. I can't stop flippin' through all of your videos. You're truly great, man.
CAN'T BREATHE
This needs a remix with KSI asap!
All his bars have so much meaning behind them
When my friends  talk shit about Daxy idk why but I take it personal........but I guess it's just me
S2       Sou brasileiro n sei falar muito ingles kkkkk mas só pra comentar mesmo kkk  Gostei muito da música,sucesso pra ti mano S2 não sei se você vai intender mas ta ai haha
love u dax keep going 💪
This is why I’m constantly playing this track because it’s the most relatable one yet
I’m always let go from jobs because of the area I stay in , my city is quite posh across the city centre and that’s where the jobs are but because I’m from a deprived area I’ve been rejected and fired for that alone
He said he will release 4 minutes of joker we haven't seen.  Everybody click the damn thumbs up!!!!
Wow Dax well said gotham isn't just a place its an mindset that we choose to grow wow  Dax I just watched gotham for the 7th time + 1 with my moms phone and the message still makes an impact! This is a song that never expires I can already tell. Wow🎼🎵❤

Yo dax your inspiring me to become a rapper

1:30-1:33 you look like 2pac, that's alright you probably share the same spirit and/or soul
Gawd damn man this shit was perfect!! Such an elaborate way to call out the industry and all the brain washed consumers..
This is fire
👏🏽 masterpiece! Congratulations!
Just dont make a new video every week again xD
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Place your faith on Jesus. Jesus died so that you can have everlasting life. Jesus is the way the truth and the life, no one gets to the Father but by him. Trust Jesus.   God bless you.
Dax is like the last hope of the new generation of rap
Yo I just dropped a remix to this a few days ago! Go peep that and sub if you dig it 🔥
Ayy
This was harddd!
How are u dax hope ur a going well I am bc ur songs make me happy I'm a big fan first song I ever heard she cheated again ur a lot of people voice ur like a role model keep it up ur music is fire I love ur music ur my second favorite rapper
Can't get over this song 🔥🔥🔥🔥  💯💯
Snoop Dog, Travis Scott and Dax got their costumes of Batman
“You think you need this place but you don’t, happiness is not a physical place you call home, did you ever wondered why you feel the way that you feel when you take that time away from your phone? Fake shit goes viral, we know this won’t, they’ll say care but will never show, Gotham isn’t just a place, it’s a mindstate watered by the thoughts manifest what you grow”. This is the most real thing I have ever heard. Not only is this entire song just so relatable, it’s real and honest. Society is doomed, we take serious things very lightly when everything is truly important. The other line of “in Gotham, everybody knows everybody, If you ain’t got a blue check you ain’t anybody” hit very close because all people love those who are famous and if you’re not you’re not truly known by people. I just wanna say this is extremely extremely well done. I am listening to this on repeat.
This song makes really hard points I love it it’s deep
This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Reallll good
Here before 10M views!!!!!

Dax 🔥🔥🔥💘
Don't wanna be famous just want people to enjoy my beats and stay behind the scenes. Anxiety makes it hard for me to be around people anyway. If you get time check out my newest instrumental though. Would be an honor Dax. https://youtu.be/j89DoUXqQxc
Huh... Dax just is missing some thing for me.. just feels like a wanna be Joyner or jcole but his music doesn’t want me to keep coming back to listen to him. I can’t point out what’s missing
I Never liked his music including this one but I can see the work ethic
Have you really liked 16k comments 😶
Nice brrooo banger after banger
The legend is back
I just discovered you but I wish that there were more rappers like you, you're a really talented guy and your lyrics are🔥🔥🔥, you've got a new fan

Best Dax song I've ever heard. This song was just my style completely. I'ma make a remix to it now.

Wow dax this song is so cool
Dax✊🏿🔥🔥🔥

Hey Dax love the vids keep it up
i love Stevie Knight and i was watching your`s reaction to this song. i heard 30 second of it in the reaction... i was like this shit is to good to getting threw it in 35 minutes. came hear and i have tears trying to push throw my eyes. this song is a gift DAX! i relate to every singel word u said, the things u say is on my mind 24/7! and it annoys me that people can`t realize it! and when you realize the veiws on this song it shows us how many sheeps there are in this fucked up society world! FACTS!FACTS!FACTS! much love from norway! "lost souls turning in to dead zombies" This song is to real man! thank you for this! THANK YOU THANK YOU! <3
This is good and all.. but i'll be waiting for something like rap god 2. Keep up the good work Dax.

That’s dope bro 🔥🔥🙏🏽
wow you really outdid yourself dax well done
DAX the Facts 💯
This sir aint no false profit! I'm tha real deal killa snipa;)  And you sir our on Tha fathers radar for ya blasphemy And deceiving in every other song special my favorites;) I think ThAdvequate has a softer heart than tha Almighty sorry its just ah business opportunity that really makes me a poor man that didn't come from wealth and sure tha fu** don't own any land. No worries it has nothing to do with you or him, wait me. No im sorry that was mean.all business to your father... psshhhh it rhymes with Satan. Ya know tha guy who I stood toe toe with spiritually and laughed when I won. Times ah ticken they say blood is thicker than water and your about to get a bath with this knowledge and wisdom. Lmao oh BTW  Yeshua is the best rapper 🤣 to be continued in due timing Dax. Ps pass this along to tha industry that'll make me. And you sir happen to be my 2nd fav rapper out rn. Js between Matt and whatever your birth name is. I just hope and pray im lucky enough to be apart of history cus today I almost died from getting too high off of weed. Crazy I know its still ah mystery. Soon solved by one powerful prayer in tha name of Jesus Christ that'll make history. Or im crazy and never call me back again lmao 🤣 sorry ima comedian too how bout country music singer? Not good enough an actor playing homeless for 14 days on my streets of Tallahassee. Not ah soul helped me and ill remember that personally. #ironsharpensironohthamemories

Hey Daniel. Your lyrics are so strongminded and real. You are unique! I've been going through alot the last 2 years and got 2 incurable illnesses. Since I heared Joker I just can't stop listening to your music. I appreciate you as an artist. You are helping me believe in myself. You are helping me staying alive! Thank you so much! 💜

I still dont understand why is Dax so low recognized having this voice/flow/lyrics, and some other people who just dont born for that shit have a lot more views. Keep your great job, you are one of my favourites. I've been following you since 2018. Props from Portugal

This is the first time I'm listening to Dax, and God this guy is very good, those bars were amazing, the puppeter and the blind people parts were so good, I don't know how people listen to shit music all day and this song doesn't get enough attention, do what you are doing Dax, I respect you for what you're fighting for

Crazy underrated God damn
This is cringe level 1000.  This guy is a clown and he’s like a after school special internet hip hop artist.  His content is corny af.
Now we lost King von protect this man✊
Got.ham city? Slang pork, pig city Gotham in city

It took me .25 seconds to replace my top 5 favorite artists with Dax.
Lol Dax Atleast Your Batman Isnt Like travis Scott's
Boring
I want Dax and Eminem to collaborate
Ooo is the ksi new song sick
I've lost count i been watching and sharing for my Favourite Rapper ❤

I love that Dax's songs can be funny, serious, and a specific topic. Keep it up Dax😁
got this on repeat your hard work is continuously paying off & inspiring me
Banger💥
This is firee man like the best Keep up this great fine work🔥🔥🔥
Replayed this several times. I don’t use social media, it’s all fake shit. People pretending to be happy, gaining fame for no talent, other than a big pair of tits and some cheap Turkish veneers. Also how can KSI get hits with his shit song really love, the bars are pure trash. Dax is severely underrated and I hope that people will see his pure talent soon.
Dax DAX DAX ......i just wanna say you're my favourite rapper all the time .....Much love and respect from India( Northeast Meghalaya Shillong)😎😎😎😍😍😍
He's too talented whooooaaa
Can I get a heart?

I came across this music from Instagram where the part you hit the verified button on your head was superb! Plus the meanings in this song were very deep & true! The beats were spot on as well, well done sir!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💯🔥
Sick love the vid
The last time I went through Wikipedia to know details about you. I was blissful, I was like, Damn. This is my brother from the other side. Man I got love for your skits and esp music videos thus far. . #Gotham🔥🔥🔥🔥

I wanna see the rest of joker please thats one of my favorite songs
Soreal🔥

Bro this shit fye
The best
I had this song on Repeat since Day 1 honestly this song is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥And 2019 was the first yr listening to Dax and I saw Dax had a lot of talent and I was kept listening to his music because I suffer from Depression so I listen to NF and Dax cuz they speak bout real shit
this man was made fun off multiple times, he has changed, just like logan Paul, he became better.
you've changed my mindset many times with your music. love that you can tell a story and your opinions while rhyming and making a song out of it so people can understand it
This is the kind of rap we should be listening to and passing from generation to generation... DAX is the GOAT🔥🔥💯
influence d🆘🆘🆘
when one say iam anticipate
Tbh, I used to want to be famous. I wouldn’t mind the money, but more and more I’m realizing people don’t need to know my name. Half the time, if you speak truth you get “cancelled” because people aren’t ready to hear it. Im not one to fabricate the truth for other peoples comfort so fame isn’t for me.
Some of the realist shit I've ever heard.
https://youtu.be/ghOOlTh6QqI
I’ve seen worse batmansuits, u know where
i know how to save i know how to bult they not how to kill thy know how to destroy i am a vouce shouting in the desset for all of you so they listen to us i wish you a good live a good instructif music and love
I still dont understand how you can perfectly describe such complex problems of our society in just one song. For me you are already one of the greatest lyrical artists i know. This man is beyond woke. Sending you nothing but love from Germany

Metropolis citizens: why do you still live there? Gotham citizens: it teaches us that life has meaning, dying in the gutter for no reason at all... it teaches us that the world only makes sense if you force it to
Fire 🔥🔥
I wanna be famous bcoz hate has consumed me..now I hate everyone bcoz I am nothing to them...But I want to stop hate and make haters regret whatever they thought about me...and make my family proud...that's it✊🏻

Most Underrated rapper who spits truth about this life . I did not expect this man to go this hard when I first heard him. Spread this shit. He deserves these views!

Would love to get one of your joker shirts 🤡❤️🤡❤️🤡❤️
Loved the song man I can relate
Happy to see your growing man 😘
Wow! Why am I just hearing of you!? Couple seconds into listening to your lyrics and I am in love with your mind!! I had to come check u out <3
Yo man, just want to say that your music hits me on a different level of consciences, especially in a social  level and religious level. I come from a catholic background but through the course of my life I was baptized as a Christian. I left the church with one of the reasons of me seeing things that made me question the existence of god to the conclusion that there is no god (always been a skeptic to religion).  I was really involved by serving at my church services, going to Bible study etc, and I also got to experience speaking in tongues (which idk yo weird as fuck). Since I had left I said there was no god but I would say my life also has been a pattern moving up of course with the hardship and shit but with a positive result. But i never stop my search for him , which at this point idk what I’m searching for because the older Iv gotten Iv had more questions than answers, things don’t make sense or add up but deep down inside  I can there is things that makes me say god may be real. It’ll be pretty dope if one day we can talk about this and have a deep convo.
Pretty good song!  This can be call Rap!
To be honest this made me open my eyes a little more, NLE Choppa once said "your not born till you open your eyes" and that is facts
The most underrated rapper seriously you need more popularity
YESS!
Daaaaaaamn can't love u less dax
1M IG FOLLOWERS SOON!
Amen.......Dax.......Amen😔

Verified part really deep tho
Tu és uma lenda 🔥🔥.
Better than travis Scott batmans outfit
Yo DAX "mi Genna" [my genral] thank you for your powerful words in its magnificent form bruh👊🏿
I honestly would rather not be famous. I like the idea of owning a brand that's famous. But I don't want my person to be famous due to how unhappy people who themselves are famous seem to be. I don't want to be swarmed when I go into public. I'd rather be a ghost among the population especially with anxiety disorders it's just a nightmare to be famous famous.  If I could make games and publish them under a brand and watch people enjoy my games and know I'm financially stable so I can escape a 9-5; that's my dream.  And I only work with friends because of this. Other people will just cut you down to get what they want. And I've experienced that in a studio environment and it just tore the passion and joy game development gave me. It was a nightmare.   If I can have a place to live and food to eat while making games; that's all I want. Whether that requires fame or not isn't much of a concern and preferably not.
Consumed by the algorithm, it becomes clear.  Life's a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer.  Blind people leading blind people driving cars to a destination that is unclear, while they can't steer.    I'm shook.
No one would need a check if everyone realized we are made in God's image and you can go CHECK THAT... Amen! Powerful song bro!!!!!!!!!!!!!! people need to know this in life thx for making me understand it dax
That Batman suite fye
I love the sound of the hook when he said Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'cause they can't control in Gotham
i feel that song ...
Amazing job with this one Dax! Message is fantastic, wordplay is on point, and the chorus is a FUCKING VIBE bro!💯 🔥

6 milión wiews????🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 lets GO!
Dax you have a special gift and learned to use it for the good of  the people. You could easily sellout talking about money,drugs and buying depreciating assets while making boatloads of money. Instead you stay true to you and have a connection by putting strong emotions into lyrics as you have the ability to put yourself in others shoes while fighting your own battles. Thank You Dax! You don’t hear this enough 🙏🏼 🙏🏼
Someone sold their Soul ?
I dont wanna be famous it just  ruin's your life you become known and you have so much money you don't  know what to do with it
U have a real talent and your a great artist it seems like you the only artist that has enough heart and courage to expose the things happening in the world and I respect it keep grinding and may God continue to bless you deserve every last bit of it 💯❤️🔥👏
Ok, i dont think bruce wayne is using snapchat, yet the biggest surprise is still the song. Always providing the top quality music and still you always outdo yourself. Thats some crazy stuff going on. <3
This is actually good, you really ate that criticism
i know im doing my bit to get this out there,  must have put about 100 views in to catch everything!   near enough learned the lyrics now!
This song would be perfect for TV show called Gotham
there’s a thing about your rap that it makes me listen to you a thousand times and never gets bored, love from India 🇮🇳 man. you really impacted my life and I can’t thank you enough. wish you a lot of success. 🧡
Please make a song about reverse flash
This song along with joker make you a legend
How to make a Dax music video: Look like you have been violently beaten/ get tortured        either way the music is still great
one of the best rappers of all time. just facts 🔥
Got me in my feelings... 😔
I love the songs that teach a lesson love this
🔥
@0:40 😯🔥🔥🔥.. ugh, hits hard⚘ I seriously lov this one!
He always spits fax but why he gotta make it so corny bruh he got so much potential
I'm here everyday 😭😭😭😭
Dax is back 🔥🔥
when are u going to make a new song
Dax alway be going hard in music ong
This spoke volumes to me I’ve gone through those I’ve felt this pain I’ve tried hard to not accept it but it brings you down constantly and all the fake people are a constant in life and no matter how much you try to ignore it it comes back into your life. I’ve cut out all socials in my life to ignore the fake ness no one is real and no one wants to be honest with themselves. This song makes me look deeper in myself and be wary of the souls around me. This is a beautiful song. And it spoke volumes to me. Thank you Dax.
Towards "how badly do you want to be famous?" It depends on what your wanting to be famous for. I don't want to be famous, I rather be well known/underground, I enjoy my privacy, accomplished and well established is more like it, being well known is fine.
My number 1 fav youtuber love your song keep up the good work 😁
You didn't say the n world dude, thats the path who will lead you in a different way than any other rapper, keep it like that, im your fan since I saw the rap god remix.
My girlfriend said she doesn't like Dax and his songs, it got me wondering the type of girl i got. she is single now

Very good EMIWAY BANTAI fan 🙏
Hollywood. = Gotham. Demons with a platform = Hollywood. Dax is in the fucking trenches.
Dax says some of the realist shit that I've ever heard i listen to his songs and just makes me think what life would be like if no one judged people cause they look a certain way or the type of music they listen to or the place they live in and its sad to say that we will never live in a judgment free world
One of the realest out there, much love and respect!
Dax good song man 🔥🔥🔥
Fax

Dax your music is some of the best I’ve ever heard, with me saying that my daughter has been distant for the past 2 years, I come to realize why she has been distant 😁 she listens to you on repeat, she’s is truly a big fan of yours, and I’m pretty sure your music has gotten her through some things in life.
Love the story telling dax

This Is Rawww Dax is Up There Above most These Wack Arse Fake Hype Rappers His Lyrics have meaning
Soy pobre de mamá África por favor 🔔👍
fake shit goes viral we know this wont
I honestly will never understand how someone who creates such great music can like so many damn comments,I don’t have the motivation to do either of those things
Greetings from germany, im listening to your now for 3 years and im always telling my friends that you Are so underrated man KEEP IT UP
and I thought dear god was an amazing production, great job Dax
Love you DAX❤️
DAX PLEASE MAKE more of these DOPE SONGS I loving them  ur the best dax Peace
Yo this should be the batman theme song.
You know why most people don't like Dax? Coz he's REALL!!
This made me imagine my  summer this year in like a movie reel. And that one song when your in dessert
I'm waiting for any concert in Cracow
👁✊❤️🔥
MY FAVORITE PART OF THE SONG - 1:45, IT'S JUST SO GOOD!
Bro now you talking!!!!
"Fake shit goes viral we know this won't" Soo true.
it me aj DAx  i took my family to phone to like your music vidieo  coz i like this song and cant wait for the next vidioes   please guys 👌200K likes not to much Dax you like a father to me
It depends on what you want to be famous for. ( great song btw )
Never really liked dax but this is another level you can't hate this
I appreciate dax for this
what do you expect when dumb people got smart phones... that really got me
I don't know why I keep sleeping on this guy but he always blow my mind
In Gotham 🔥🔥💥
Ghana...Dax
It's added to my favorites songs.
Man, this is an awesome song.
This song is beautifully designed and well written, but I only have one question.  How tf are you Batman and joker?!
IT'S DAX!!!!!
Another banger... as always. Keep it up 💯
Dax deserves more Fans for such masterpieces he creates 🔥
1:34
My guy ITS DAX that “villain of lyricism”...when I heard “ made a name for myself by doing it differently, I started writing poetry then I had an epiphany, and instantly started meshing words into a symphony and calculating patterns and delivering them brilliantly to go into your mind so I could paint a vivid imagery” on the kill shot remix I said this man gonna be a problem and the Dear God was like speaking my own thoughts, now you hit us with Joker and Gotham, I was stoked when I seen you with Stevie Knight bc he is the dopest reactor doing it and both you guys have found a way to be uniquely different than anybody else doing it 💪🏻💯🔥
It pisses me off that dax anit blown up yet they way he deserves it  respect dax
Mais uma obra de arte , que belo clip , um grande artista
Greetings from Germany 💯💪🔥🚨

Bars are always amazing 🔥 still waiting for Dax and Token to collab.
Is It Me Or Do I See A Tie Between This And His Other Song JOKER? And The Movie JOKER How Murray Says When Arthur Is Being Interviewed "Are You Trying To Make A Symbol Or A Movement" What If Thats What The Clowns Are Trying To Do In This? Im Sorry I Got Too Into My Theory.
My top 5 rappers are... 1. Eminem  2. Nf 3. Dax 4. mgk 5. b.o.b

Hey dax your awesome, but I don't really like the talk raping if you know what I mean, but you make it pretty good
I think I've been here since less then 500k
Jokes aside your batman costume better than Travis Scott😂
"happiness is not a physical place you call home" This was needed🔥 thanks DAX!! 💯
One of my close friends sent a screenshot of the lyrics of the song. It caught my attention because: 1. The lyrics 🔥 2. I'm a fan of Batman  She encouraged me to listen to it and here I am.

Dax has a blue check for being the most honest in the industry he didnt make these songs to look like a good person he made it to make others into a better p person. He is no gimmick
Man, second time hear this song. And still my fav. When i starts my day
Man, it would be an honor to make a track with you Dax💯
This man is legit underrated AF, I am proud of me and everyone else who is actually listens to these songs, cause they are worth it

This was fire as fuck
I love u
I would rather hear the last 4 mins of joker
Yooooo go daxxxx fire af bro
Fire
You are saying everything that the quiet are too afraid to say. People who read between the lines and observe how the world ticks notice it as well. Such a powerful message that sadly most people will rap along with to a new TikTok dance. All the while oblivious that you’re speaking about them. My genre of go to music is very heavy metal but something tells me you’ll end up in my song library 🤘🏼
Wow I'm tough....this message is powerful.....Jesus is the only way. God bless all the people reading this message 🙏
This should go iviral but damn fools r using phone
King Dax✌🚀🚀  I'm Mozambican
Dax at his best. This shit is such a banger🔥🔥🔥
Give me a hug or I will sue 100 dollars
He needs to play the next Joker 🤟🤞
The realest rap in reality expressing the insanity,  bills only buy food and vanity , no tools for creating a future only excuses , sup dax , i cant relax my brain taxes but your tracks get me gliding , thank you , im writing my mind hope that im inspiring, stay awake,  your great
My man spitting fire🔥🔥Dax Ur too Good🙏🔥
I just wanna tell man I salute you big words in this song just imagining how u thing this lyrics woo crazy my g 🙏🏾🙏🏾
God
This is amazing... wow!!! 🃏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Hey man...u ok?
for someone who doesn't really listen to pretty much any modern rap, I really liked this and some of your other songs (I literally just found out about you a few minutes ago, I like)
Keep Shining ✨
This is my first time coming across your music. I'm probably older than most of your fans. I just have to say you're incredibly talented and I love this video so much. It's poetry in motion to me. So good!
bruh we all know that any song dax makes is just fire like no need to listen to tell if its good you just listen cause its 🔥
Its so good I've listened to this for more than five hours now
2:24 He held unto his stomach when he was hit in the face lmao
Make a Song with MGK.. it would kill every rap..
dax i love your music it’s so much more than lyrics it’s the meaning behind it your songs have heart in it things many rappers lack even famous ones and it has originality
How in tf do ppl listen to this
Dax underrated asf Ong , been listening to bruh since “hit em up” ‼️💯
🔥
Strong words brother. Much respect
Amazing bro listening you for the first time    dope
To be Honest, when Dax said this song won’t, I felt that, I’ve been putting off listening to this song, then finally decided to listen to it. So that’s kinda sus.
🔥🔥🔥DUB K MUSIC🔥🔥🔥
OMG DAX un saludo desde tierras latinas :3
This is anti-cancel culture and i love it
This is lit 20secs in
Yo Dax No Life Shaq sent my brother but my words are my own. I want to say thank you for your words of truth on every platform; YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, reddit, ALL OF THEM!!!! I still to this day can't think of any one of them that doesn't take what they think of you and meme it. Thank you for always being a real one. ✊
This song is one of your best
I love the lyrics because ITS DAX!   Much love and your best song imo

Thanks for ths great works Dax day ones still here listening to the message
Dont wanna be famous..Just want to spend my life on the farm
2 Songs with DC related titles? Hopefully that means Dax gets to do the theme for the upcoming batman movie 🤔😉🙃
Love the video and the song, hope I get to see you live one day. Stay true to you man
Is he joker of Batman?
You have me screaming in the car when you drop the bars!!! Speak it!
Idooooooo
I havent had a song make me think like this in a hot minute. Goosebumps.When we get some success how do we know the ones trying to get in our life is somone we need around. People will cut your throat just cause they mad you got talent or skills. Some people dont wanna tell you your worth cause they dont want you to know just how good you really are and dont wanna give what you deserve..they want us to think we need them cause if we ever found out we didnt what does that mean for them.
When the hell did my mans hit a mill congrats   Guess i was gone for a while
Dax is literally my favorite musician hes not only a musician but hes a artist, one of the best in the game
These videos are too much
The bar, “Blind people leading blind people.” Is one of the realist thing I’ve heard in while
We needed this 🙌 so preach it
So he’s gonna like my comment?
This dude is off the charts. Thx for not selling out!
Damn this should be song of the year for sure🔥
This is actually amazing! I love this guy man!!!
Big pp energy 💯
he's spitting facts
why dax always beaten up in his videos
dude your amazing huge fan
Dax is one of a kind and is so underrated. This man has unparalleled talent and is one of the realist, most humble artists out there. Big up DAX! Keep doing your thing sir! You have my respect.
Bruh this shit hits hard......🔥🤟.... so much truth in this song... an I've never seen an artist likes all their fans comments.. blessings from the Caribbean my brother✌
🙌🙌
Dax you are Lit AF.  im your biggest fan❤️❤️❤️
This shit is fire
I can’t believe I’m just finding this guy
Dope
Yo DAX can I see the other 4 minutes of joker!! 🃏 keep up the grind I won’t tell or share to any one just me else you want
Keep up the good work brotha, this is my favorite song rn I listen to it on repeat in the shower💯
I was watching your live stream and you said you read most of your comments so i know this one isn't for not. I've truely been inspired by you. Thanks for uplifting me!
Wow ok unexpected
Seeing all the Instagram stories makes this hit different
Them girls I get where he coming from if ur not famous u is nothing to them but if  u is they all up on you for clout
I always like before I play your music, because I know it's🔥 My mind is suffering so much, but your the healer, thank you, Dax🔥 Stay original and uninterrupted⚘
Bro this shit dope

As both a huge fan of Dax and Batman, this is fuckin' SICK! Came out of the blue for me and i'm loving it. Great message brother!
Came here from Crypt.  Can't *wait* to see what you do next Dax! You're a straight up *animal*!!! You da man!!
This song is so fire. I love your creativity and the way you lay your words
We All Are Either Anxious Of Trump Or Support For Biden.But Deep Down We All Know Dax Has Been Rulling Our Heart🖤
It sounds a lot like ill mind of hopsin 5
Dax is for real my spirit animal an has touched apart of my soul that I have done forgot about, lost, done tossed in the grave cuz I thought it died same day i lost my sanity, but listening to him reminded me on the man I wanna be! Not shit free, nothing is easy, pain is a part of this fucked up life, it consumes me with anxiety, paranoid that people are always lying to me, frightened when I go to sleep, in my bed, alone in my head, this disease goes soo deep I often wake up in a panic, because my heart and mind is so fucking damaged I wish I could just vanish, my mental health is a issue, it sucks feeling like the one you love wouldn't miss you acting like it doesn't hurt an dont need a tissue, I'm just to proud or stubborn maybe even stupid, I'm on edge ready to lose it! But Dax has given me a reminder that I'm not alone an in order to be great you have to have scares that show's just how far u can come when u work hard! NOTHING BUT LOVE MY DUDE. YOU SAVED ME IT A TWISTED WAY THAT MOST COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND 💯💯
Jesus died for you DAX repent and believe in Jesus Christ before it’s too late!!! The prophecies are coming to be true we’re so close to Jesus return get ready!!!
Music needed you Dax! Someone that speaks so much truth and brings so much to light in this dark work. Everyone needs to listen to what this man is saying in his music. Thank you for your art and facts and dropping all these impactful tracks!
I feel like this should be in a Lin Manuel-Miranda play, and I mean that with the upmost respect #futureEGOT
I found dax a few months ago. I heard my brother playing JOKER, laughing like a crazy person, but I got use to hearing him playing it all the time, until I actually HEARD it, and now...I listen to Dax more than he does, I even told my mom that I'd cry if nothing were to happen to this dude. Over the few months that I've known him, he became my favorite Artist, Dear God became my favorite song (I swear I listened to it till I got it word for word). He opened my eyes to things really, made me look at the world from a different perspective, and now I can happily say, that I am his BIGGEST 13 Year old Fan😂😂😂
Ya this song inspired to me its fire dax
If this aint the truth. Like we living in the matrix dawg I swear what is life. You make amazing music bro congrats man you come along way DAX!
Dax is so talented. His music is so good, has some spice and action to it. But also always has a deep undertone
I’ve never seen a person speak so badly about Hollywood
3:24 Anybody else thinks he looks like Rza aka Bobby Digital?
Dax always be saying truth
Love u dax
Tu é pica
I thought this was Macklemore
You inspire us to speak
i havent heard of u. but youtube recommendations did right by u. shits fire sounds like sum for suicide squad.
Download Pending...  Glad you Okay still.
The best song ever 🔥🔥🔥
You not is demon
Tom Macdonald and Dax gotta make an album together
U go to cali and give you soul for a blue check Mark
Bruh Gotham in this song is every city in California
I don't get it why this man is not blowing but yet mum bel taped getting famous
Your music literally keeps me going as I suffer from depression. Love you dax 💪
The best rapper ever 👑
got7
Man...I was really hopin we would get the rest of JOKER :( Could Dax be forgiving enough to give us a second chance?
You are truly amazing and when I here you speak, I get chills, I get a good vibe when I'm  listening to you🙏❤keep speaking the TRUTH🙏
Hey Dax I just want to tell you that I made the basketball team today and I'm gone to celebrate by listening to all your music til I go to bed.🖤
Ngl,  I was skeptical about the "Gotham" stuff on Dax's instagram.  I wasn't thinking it's corny or trash,  but I was curious as to how he would bundle it all together if that makes any sense.  Well...       How wrong I was for even thinking about doubting Dax the Destroyer.  🔥✌️ Keep doin you g don't let the hate break you.
You good bro?
Best part of the song 2:48
Bro who could hate his music
Nice
That bold man look straight up like Vladimir Lenin 😅
Hollyfuck this is good
This is the best definition of America i could find
loved it

Another great song, awesome video and as a bonus two of the coolest comic book characters in it. You're an awesome musician and yeah it might not be everyone's thing but i love the batman aesthetic. You're awesome and creative Dax!
If you are just listening, i need to remind you to listen carefully. This song is explaining you the industry, and the world. Don't let the puppeteers bring u into the darkness.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm from east Africa tanzania I'm here to tell u  everyone knows you down here  welcome kilimanjaro and zanzibar

Dax you can sing my man, love the hooks sang by you. 🔥🔥Love from Vanuatu 🇻🇺
Love you Dax Keep making such REAL Lyrical masterpieces that you have been so gifted to bring us and hope you continue to make such amazing work.  DAX WILL be his OWN ENTITY. Fuc the labels.
My son showed me Dax Dear God. Then to me came Book of Revelations.  These two songs I only realise now have helped me to see certain truths. Now my son tells me about Gotham I'm hooked. Checked out What's Poppin and well I'm just awestruck. Since then I've watched all the music videos. I'm tired yes but it's been so worth it. I'll continue to do my part FAM whilst being aware of the very traps that Gotham video makes perfectly clear. Only my best energy for you 🌈🌞✊💓
Dax if your seeing this I love you man
If you ain't got a blue check you ain't anybody 😭😭😭 that line open my eyes yo
Love your music, your message and your delivery!  Hard love and respect Dax, you got this xx
That's fire bro 🔥🔥🔥
. Monarch programming likes this. I'm guessing his talking about Hollywood. But each Country has there own little plastic Hollywood world so it's relatable to everybody.
Watched this video 10 times in a row now :D Dam love the lyrics. People are cruel and its not about the money but the HAAAAAAAAAAA I made it and you said I couldnt !!!!! Rub their nose in it bruh :D !!!!!!!! You made it !!!! DAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX My son SoulSoulcha wants to be famous... I dont lol

Such an awesome song and video, amazing skills!!
Hell yeah. I love this guy. He's so good. An real. Omg 😁
Lol janitor
I discovered Dax in 2018, and I have yet to hear a song that he hasn't gone all out on. Keep doing what you're doing, you are an amazing artist and will continue to have my support😁😁😁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Making Money, Making Lyrics
sure to become a classic best song yet
Hey Dax
Thanks for the medicine Dax. You always make me remember to embrace my feelings instead of hiding them away like they are shameful. I hope everyone is able to tune in to your energy to heal the damage being dealt to us as kids. Why do we teach our kids to repress their emotions? :( thanks again Dax. Your right. Never let other people’s darkness taint your reality.

I got caught up in school, but to answer that question, I don't care about fame. I only care about helping people. If people tag along thats fine, but if your gonna end up trying to slow me down or try to spread hate to the positivity I have made then your more than welcome to leave, otherwise I'll personally remove you from the picture completely. Dax if you see this, how are you doing mentally and physically bro, a question coming genuinely from a fan of you.

Cringe: 25 Lit: 89 Talent: 85 Accurate: 100
How can there be so much talent in one man
Why didn’t I find you sooner?!🤯
🙏🏾❤
Thanks for helping me pick the pen back up
damn this is fireeeeee
So I think, that will be a main theme of new  part of Joker or new film about Batman
Dax you probably won't see this but if u do thanks for being u love your music it makes so much sense man..... Thank you omg.... Dax liked my comment im honored
It’s Dax!❤️
Nobody mentioned that Dax is wearing a shirt
I sit on my boyfriends phone so that i can have someone to talk to. I have insecurities that keep me from interacting with other people. Wtf happened to dear god?!
OHHHHHHHH who lives in a pineapple under the sea
Ayyy! I starve  i eat out of dumpsters so please.....
Idk if Dax will ever see this comment but thank you, because I work day and night trying to be a famous artist, and idk if its because I see how “good” these rappers life’s are, and because i just want the life of being famous, or because it’s actually something I’m passionate in doing. And tbh I still don’t know. But the reason i say thank you is because this song opened my eyes and fr made me realize maybe I’m doing this for the benefits and not because I actually love making music.
dax is one of the chosen ones
Research me
We are all the same person living life in a bunch of different bodies
Yo this song is fire u really speaking facts
Dax is a must on the collab list
Guys can y'all help me out I love what dax is saying but wat does he mean when he says that's why you feel the way you feel when you take time from your phone
We failed ?? Why delete some of the family never watched it.
Always amazing.

Since the What's Poppin remix....I've been stuck wondering why I haven't heard of you sooner.  Keep it up man, killin' it.  Provocative thoughts aimed at the sheep, Wolves don't give a shit about the opinions of meat.  ;)

Just when i thought i was the only rapper who sakes when i write my music damn im so happy now that i am not the only one. 😢❤️🔥
“The fact that people popularize you soon as your noticed by the famous is a cycle that should be broken, the underdogs in the slumps need the win without the pitty”  i fw the message of this
Dax you spitting faxs and bars
I really want the other 4 minute of joker
He’s like the mad hatter, except he’s the mad rapper wit bars never heard before

They gotta get dax on XXL freshman
This will always be my favorite video🔥
👌gotthaamm
More liks
Hey everyone, in case you missed Dax's live early this morning but.... we failed him at getting this video to 2 million views. He asked us all to play this 5 times in a row in hopes of getting this recommend to more people. This song is amazing, so isn't the video. He works so hard to bring us top notch entertainment so let's show him what an awesome fan base he has. Share this EVERYWHERE and please listen to it at least 5 times. It's amazing so that shouldn't be hard. 1.5 million views in 5 days is already impressive but let's get him that 2 million. ❤️
Bossman!!
Do you know I rap to
I've already listened to this like 50 times and no matter how many times I listen it never gets old..Dax always be spitting 💯💥
Lil tip, if you ever do decide you want to become a hero or vigilante you might want to do something different with your hair, it kinda gives you away broski. Great tune.
Dax you are the man ,respect👍
Dax, the god we dont deserve, but the one we need.
Bruh IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS DUDE IS TRYING TO SAY!!!!!
its like at face value it sounds like a rap about gothem and batman and joker but when you listen it has an actual message........ crazy
@ Hamza dali dax was always in there
This is the best song in the world, you and Eminem really need to do a collab
Love the new song bro.
Dax🚀🚀🚀🔥🔥🔥🔥
Vlog with dax dreams comes true https://youtu.be/uueu88UatCE
Good stuff
Artistry defined! And much more.
Omg that's so true like before fame or if people dont know you they wont even bother your but you slap a verification sticker on you or you get that one touch of fame everybody want some.
Is it just me or every thing Dax say is always true🤔🤔

I want Dax to star in a Jordan Peele movie. I think he would make as good an actor as a rapper.
I am a KSI fan but I also love Dax's music.

Today is my Birthday
You have progress SO far, Dax.   My dude, well done. 💯   The growth in artists is the most amazing thing to witness. 💯
I’m not gonna lie, if I was in Gotham, I would be able to identify that Dax is Batman. The hair man
Anx pleeeeeeeeease I’m praying that he changes this stupid haircut... only lyrics makes u a survivor I admit that 😌
If you just normal good looking guy...it’s always toooooo much like I watch rappers from hunger games 😅
😂everyone calls me weird when I tell them I dont give a fuck bout being famous or not carring about being popular and having a nice house or a nice car and money there are more important things in the world
How could someone unlike this thank you dax for enterntaining us during this crisis
Powerfull🔥🔥

Ufff a hard ✨💓 so real and true ... 💔😔 ..
Ur song is fire dax and also the lyrics
“I be shaking when I write my music”
This should be in every Batman movie and and game from now. Damn man that chorus... wow
Dislikes for what XD
damn.. DAX is levelling up his game 🔥🔥 (but like he's always been on another level 👍🙌)... THIS IS AMAZING!!
Keep making music like this it’s 🔥
This was okay
Dax I'm sorry we did not get the 200,000 yet hopefully we get a joke please give us another chance to get that song I Love The Joker I love everything you put out hopefully you're doing okay
When i say Goat allot of people assume  to be one you have to be old and been in the game for years. Nah man thats false simple fact is DAX is a lyrical genius and can spit with the best of them. Simply he is a Goat . Name how many rappers that can touch his bars?
Come on y'all. Let's get this song to a well deserved 200k likes so we can hear the other half of joker. Your songs always hit me on a different level. One of the most underrated independent artists out there. Much love Dax. 💯
arrived here from big stevie Knight!!! class track my friend!!!
This is another level Dax, holy shit!!
I love your songs and here I can finally find REAL videos and REAL messages I love you dax man you helped me through a lot with I cant breathe please dont stop doing your thing and I hope I see you in movies in the future because all of your music videos are like mini movies
Dax this shit is so cold 🥶🥶🥶🥶 what a banger!!!
You wouldn't know real till it slaps u in the face !!!
https://youtu.be/9fa3fgWffiw
Dax to be honest you one of the best rappers out there if more ppl have knew about you bro you have been getting way more views likes and subs love you keep up 🤘💯🔥
Fuck the fame I just want to let it be known that there’s more so very much more out there than the media cares to show.
Repeat run up the views
I Said this before on a comment from your story but I want to make sure that you receive it. I will be making a track called “WWDD” what would Dax do. I don’t have a specific release date nor do I have any audio to release but once I do I will be sure to let it hit them charts so you can see it and maybe Ill be able to have yah get on for a feature on the remix or something down the road. Dax & Strange Music 4 lyfe 💯
The fact that you did Batman in this video had me. Not only do you spit facts but you a real one bro. I still don't know Eminem hasn't collab with you yet but you'll get there. I mean if kid cudi can ruin adventures of moon man and slim I'm sure you have a chance. Not saying anything negative about you bro. I respect you fr
What a tuneeeeeeee dax!
We gotta get it to 200k like come on!!
Rockstar
you work with isreal pepole dax ?
In my opinion, this might be his best song he’s made yet. Good shit Dax!!
Definitely out did yourself here. I'm major league impressed DAX. 🔥
DAX is the greatest 👌
Live from Ghana we love you Dax❤
Man dax is so underrated. Bars for dayyys
Smart phone isn't the problem weak-minded people that let social media apps control them why would you want people to know about your business that's why I don't have social media just you tube for my news and music . hungry for attention or nosy people  are not in my circle
Dax motivates me thank you DAX!!
Your songs make me feel alive
You outdid yourself on this one bro you just keep getting better and better
well crap we didnt get joker
this song  is really good.
'My mind is in Gotham'
No one can compare to dax 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wait is your tattoos ancient Mongolian writing?
Dax is one of my favorite rappers 💙🔥
feelin this one
Ill admit this is a good song like fire but didnt u say ur a cloutchaser?
this track is pure heat good shit Dax
They ain’t sleeping on you they’re in a coma on you
I am french and i'm telling you your clip and your son are really really amazing
I don't know how but i feel everything from his voice. You're amazing Dax!
I don't wanna be famous...  I just want to be heard..  And I want to put my mind into every verse... I dont really know why.. but maybe I'm hurt.. I may have lost my shine.. But ill put in the work.. It's hard for me to write... But thats just part of my curse.. I may be partially blind...  but I can see through the curtain.. So maybe I'll open my eyes.. And be a better person.  Im gonna do this..no matter what..I will be heard with or without help..with or without money..this is who I am..I will not stop until I find myself
Dax, love the song man. I’m bummed to see that this video didn’t hit 200k likes but it has 1.4 million views. Maybe next time. Keep grinding my man.
sin = anything that breaks God's law. We can’t enter heaven with a criminal record (with sins). For example: If we have said even one lie during our lives then we have committed a crime against God. This is why everybody is a sinner according to the bible and destined to Hell, but here are the good news: since no human is perfect, Jesus Christ, God in human form, came to the earth around 2020 years ago, he lived a sinless life and died on the cross for our sins, he was buried for 3 days and on the third day he came back to life (He resurrected). If you believe this with your heart (not just your head) all your sins will be forgiven and you receive the free gift of eternal life (saved forever). The bible says that Jesus Christs’ shed blood on the cross is the only thing that can take my sins and your sins away. We cant go to HEAVEN based on what WE do (our good deeds), but based on what HE has already done for us (He has paid the price for our sins). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh1VU-_OF98  John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Fire! Another hot track from Dax. All facts.
This song and vid were so fucking amazing
DAMN DAX
Just so you know man. In the midst of many haters, we love you.(real fans) And your music is like pills, we take a dose often, and it heals... You're a living legend.

Imagine a part 2 but locksmith as Robin 🔥💯
Women gold digging as a sport WTF!

if he was not singing it would be a 10/10
I hear a story about someone falling into the darker world of fame and the sides that nobody knows. Where people only love you for what you are not who. I'm glad your back Dax I started to get worried. You are such an inspiration!
I thought this channel was bigger, it definitely should be

This is literally how society is right now and it's very sad to see 😔
Dax back at it agian whoopin some A$$
Sorry Dax I couldn’t be here sooner
Dax always coming with the pressure !!! I would love to colab !!!
Sharing this where I can. This song must be blowing up youtube cause the page took about 5 mins to fully load.  Dax gets big ups from me for manifesting the highest expression of his sun sign(and that's with not even trying)--more than doelow. Hope guys like krs1, immortal tech and especially k priest sit up and take notice of your work. ~Peace~ young bro Peace. Your Destiny  will be Amazing in whatever direction you steer it. Don't let your internal troubles swallow you whole or even nibble off of you . Protect yourself, your personal space, your egg--don't let anyone crack it. Anyone can see you are so much better than to give in to self-destruction. You have NO reason to self-loathe, your healing comes from you healing others the way you do with your music. But your righteous indignation towards all things faux? So very apropos, please keep doing that.  Sending lots of good vibes your way. You are a Healer.
As a batman fan, I have just officially become a dax fan
Bro snapped
''they gon build you just to break you the rebuild you to break'.  the lyrics in this tune are just mind blowing!!

“I be shaking when I write my music, I’m anti violent, but don’t push me cause I might just do it. Angels with the greatest influence but I see demons that just fucking abuse it” took them to church with this, fight the system this is the system of the antichrist. Yes there will be a figure head of the antichrist eventually. 🔥🔥🔥 is all I really got to say couldn’t say it better myself.
telling the truth, talking about all that is happening. Its my prayer God takes you far. You is a rapper all the other rappers should look up to, you always encourage us with your music. Dax for life, love you man
Bro I hope this gets enough likes that he pops out Joker Part 2.
I just love this! Every word... nuttin but the truth. You really are awakening humanity for which I am so thankful. Glad there's still artists like you. Artists with deeper messages. Much appreciated! This hit belongs on my daily playlist ❣️🙏🏻

We want the other 4 minutes of joker
💙⚓️❗️
Dax, have you read Jaron Lanier’s Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now? I am in the middle of it. I started paying attention to this stuff because you reminded me to, Dax. I had forgotten to disengage so I could work on getting back to a place free of manipulation. The BUMMER system is turning fake real so real seems fake. Thank you for fighting for us, Dax! We are real and we are here listening.
Hey bro, why doesn't crypt like you? I think your dope!

Ain’t you the same dude that stole song that my cousin was wit peep on and ignored him completely and dropped the song on his own even tho they already recorded the whole thing together
Heard this song once and it still when I play it, gives me chills. Love this song. Love the work you do. Love you bro, its great, keep up the great work, for the fam and yaself. Stay smooth

Listening to this music and watching the video makes me have a rethink of my next steps bruh... One love “DAX”
Gotham ain't a place , it's a mind state waterd by thoughts that manifests what you've growned!!

"GOTHAM"  I think that we're headed down the wrong road (I swear) Fake's real and they say real's fake woke (You see this?) False prophets on these screens everywhere we go But what did you expect when dumb people got smartphones More memes cool make it all a big joke Crown your fake kings and let them sit up on your fake thrones You're young now but just wait until you grow old When life gets real you'll remember all these words I wrote I went roaming walked multiple ways For 40 nights 40 sleeps yes multiple days (I tried) In the desert no food water searching for the answers But you listen to these people who got nothing to say (You wouldn't listen) You wouldn't know real if it slapped you right in the face Ain't for the culture I can tell by the shit you embrace (I see it) I'm in Gotham but my minds in a different place So fuck your co-signs, money, and your radio play I be shaking when I write my music I've been anti-violent but don't push me 'cause I just might do it (Don't push me) They won't give you no credit 'cause they know you'll use it And that's what happens when the master starts fearing the student (They learn) In this city you're a number they don't see you as human (They don't see) Just a puppet they replace for their games and amusement In a city full of angels with the biggest influence I see demons with a platform who just fucking abuse it  In Gotham...  Everybody knows everybody (Everybody) If you ain't got a blue check you ain't anybody (Fuck) Redo, repeat, sleep, double tap, see copy Lost souls unaware they're turning into dead zombies (Zombies) Everywhere you look is plastic all fabricated Everything you've seen on TV was exaggerated (It's so fake) Don't nobody see you till you get a million Followers and when you do they treat you Like you're someone and you're validated What do you do? How much money you make? Who do you know? What do you drive? Where do you stay? (Where do you stay?) And while you're answering those questions They'll be calculating how much of it they can see themselves trying to come in and take If you're fragile don't you even try come to this place (Don't come here) They gon' build you just to break you then rebuild you to break Let you reach your own limit then heroically save And that's exactly how Gotham turns you into a slave  In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your minds in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Nobody's from here But everybody comes here Wanting to be famous Till they realize the price of fame brings close everything that they once feared Consumed by the algorithm it becomes clear Life's a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer Blind people leading blind people driving cars To a destination that is unclear while they can't steer 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 Drugs alcohol addiction morgue Fake friends women gold-digging as a sport Who convince you, you should live a whole life you can't afford Nobody sees you, you're continuously ignored Everybody wants fame they don't care what it's for They don't wanna build theirs, They're just tryna take yours This is dog eat dog in this messed up world  You think you need this place but you don't Happiness is not a physical place you call home Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel When you take that time away from your phone Fake shit goes viral we know this won't They'll say they care but will never show Gotham isn't just a place it's a mind state Watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow  In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your minds in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls 'Cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Don't tell 'em how you feel 'cause I promise they won't call back Everybody's in it for money so it's all bad Killing off my demons I'm rapping this in all black I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta Prove nothing to Gotham They ain't done nothing for me... for me

Man ur lyrics blow my mind dear god is something I listen to every day I’m glad somebody is still writing real shit
Unpositive/kinda positive.....at least the negative comments benefit you as far as the algorithm goes.
To lose your mind may not be bad....where you don't lose it though
Fighting ones self to save ones self.
To allow ones self to be vulnerable is strength
Comment comment.
Open ears....open minds
Fake throns..... we dont wont 'em
🤩😍🤩😍
Beautiful
Another AMAZING song, no surprise. You keep killing this shit.
number one Malawian fan
these visuals are insane ... giving me ideas this is legendary
NGL dax is really improving his music
Is that hit girl?
He is the greatest rapper ever
DAX true g, this track hits hard, and your live last night your doing this next level, unfortunately thanks to time zone differences and holding down employment I can't stick with the lives bro, so I miss out on a lot, I ain't phased.... I'm background... Pcheys got you dax!!! Love from the UK bro, but I do need joker pt 2 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
It's ironic that this is on the internet. And that you only uploaded to be famous
Yep. Just yep. ❤️🖤🙏🏽
can imagine all the passion and the emotion when he was spitting in the booth.
DAX vs kSI boxing     Like if u wanna see it
Dax Batman’s outfit is better than Travis Scott’s 😂
Dammit, We will not get the 4mins of Joker  *...Mission Failed...*
Dope ! Do it 👏
Dax never sugar coats,,he says what you should hear,,much love from Kenya,Africa
Dope song 🎵 👌 🙌 🔥
Every fuckin line hit
Man its underrated af🔥
Dax top 5 right now not gonna lie
What a tune
Ksi talks a lot of shit, and while i think you can be an idiot, this song shows your intelligence
“I be shaking when I write my music! I’ve been anti violent but don’t push me ‘cause I just might lose it!”   This sent shivers down my spine because it spoke to me. Y’all don’t understand as an artist that when we put out heart, soul, and every single fiber of our being out emotions rise and we feel the lyrics as we write them!   That’s how we know what we’ve made will someday make an impact and have true meaning to others the same way we felt it while we wrote it.  Dax I’m ngl about a year ago I wasn’t a fan and honestly I didn’t like some of the shit you did, but you’ve come so far and your music has shaken me to my core leaving me speechless and motivated, It inspires me as well as on others I’m sure with it’s impact. Please don’t stop until you reach the top.   Gotham is a much needed to be heard truth about fame and celebrity status and I’m amazed at the lyricism and messages you continue to spread to the masses. 💯🔥🔥🔥
Dax spitting really facts
Woah.
You have the best videoclips from all rappers. <3
"false prophets scream everywhere we go, but what did you expect when dumb people have smart phones?" One of the best lyricists in the game
Ahh Dax that shit reminds me of what happened to Travis damn its like u knew it from the start damn people will eat u alive 🔥🔥🔥🤦🏾‍♂️   The shit is the bomb 🔥 Pull up to SA December cool🌊🌍
Track✊🏽🔥 just shoot a movie  you too good
Love that you always have a message in your music and visuals my brotha 💯🙏🏽 Can't wait to one day work with you! 💯💯 Always an inspiration
Better batman cosplay than travis scotts lmao
wow these lyrics
Your message is strong and god bless you
LIVING IN GOTHAM X1000000000000 XD
Me watching this on my iPhone : 👁👄👁
Eysh the message is real
I love the song 😁
Cool Video.  Keep grinding  ⚡️
👌🏻💔
I can't help it feel like I have been waiting for this
“Blind people leading blind people driving cars leading people to an unknown destination while they can’t steer.”
This video is sick! Amazing work by Moses, Dax and everyone who made this!
1:10 it's sad because it's SO TRUE, Thanks for making this Dax, very good way to return, Much respect my man

The verified check mark. Yup...
📝 killed it 🔥
You spoke to my soul today, <3
This is the real music my man. The real music ❤️🔥

This is so dope
Russia watch you 2020
Dax,you are my new favorite artist atm.God bless!
Very deep bro
Who really dislikes smh. WHO DO YOU KNOW THAT'S DOIN IT LIKE THIS!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Stop playing with him!!
“Happiness is not a physical place” welcome back Dax 🔥
Dax you're right, you're saying it just how it is in this song, great music, wise words
This is why I like DAX he speaks straight up facts that other rapper don’t 💯💯💯
Amazing....just amazing, the message is greater then any music out out now, astounding how anyone can dislike this, " fake shit goes viral we know that this wont".......
Still a better Batman costume than Travis Scott 😭
Pin this if u truly love your fans
🖤
Everyone leave a like on the vid I wanna hear the other 4 min of joker
Demonz.....iamclearlanes.com
DAX IS ALWAYS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥! Every track is amazing & the way he’s able to tell as detailed of stories as he does with his tracks is phenomenal! I was born in ‘86 & when I was old enough started to listening to PAC before & after he was killed and to me Dax is the reincarnation of Pac! Do I dare say a better version?? Regardless the man’s got talent dripping off of him & his songs aren’t all about money, girls & weed. They each have their own real word meaning! I do suggest if you haven’t watched any of Dax’s old videos where he does covers for some of Pac’s songs but with his own style then I highly suggest you check em out!
Dax: the kind of rapper who actually spits bars.
Why is Dax still so underrated
Dax, Keep doing what you are doing. Your messages do not fall on deaf ears, you are heard. We fight being in the world so hard because we are not of it. Don't ever lose that spirit of integrity that you show so passionately. Much love from Desert Hot Springs So Cali
I can't believe I missed this 4 days ago. I'm from South Africa, and Dax has always been my inspiration when it comes to facing off my depression.  Gotham was just the song I needed due to bullying that has been happening in my school and the categories the students are labelled it, it kind of sucks,because they only notice you when you're well known
who know Dax voted for who?
YALL NEED TO SMASHIN THE LIKE BUTTON...SHARE IT TO YOUR FRIENDS AND MAKE THEM LIKE...GET ON THE GRIND FOR 200K LIKES
I love this song so much
I love it u dissed but u shouldn't have displayed memes in negative way and super serious bout this       u guys know that I'm MEMING right?
Love you work Dax, mad respect
Dude I appreciate the messages you spread in your music. There isnt enough of this out there so thank you for being willing to be real and talk real.
This message is so good.
I just can’t help it, play button on repeat! impact!!
I wish there was a love button.
Dax, thank you for being the creator you are. You are too woke for most. Don’t dumb it down. Nothing but love from South Carolina. If you ever need a couch or a hot plate, I got you!
Yo why the vid go so hard tho
Dax is it bruh this was incredible 🔥🔥
🔥
Damn I heard it once on snapchat but then I tried searching it for a straight 3 days and today I found its name on the same app and now the last thing I know is that it's going on my playlist for forever......❤️
So good 🙌
0:12 “what do you expect when dump people gat smartphones”  Dax has never disappointed me 🔥🔥🔥🔥.

How the hell Dax got a better Batman costume than Travis Scott
Low key I’d buy that suit off of you.
This describes the world at the moment another legendary message

Not really a fan not really a hater but man do you make some amazing music
I shared to my insta story
I just enjoy his music because he speaks the truth either way of what this generation has gone through and how we think instead of reality
This ain’t sleeping on someone what people is doing, this is a whole different type of sleeping on someone.  This is exquisite ❤️
The thing is I don't want to be famous, I just want to make an impact.

Hi I'm a 13 year old white boy who loves to rap. I know that might sound corny, but hear me out. I've been freestyling since 8. I do it for like 2-3 hours a day. Music is an escape from all sorts of problems for all types of people.  No one knows about my passion except a few close friends,  not even my parents.  I'd honestly say I'm quite versatile, I rap on all types of beats. I'm  also a decent storyteller. I've been writing songs for like a year. But my problem is that I live in Poland(I speak fluent English,  I moved to here at 11), and I really want to make it to the US. I just want some advice for future life, and if this work I put in is even worth it. Thanks, if you want to send me a dm or something I can give you my Instagram.
"They will build you just to break you then rebuild you to break" Wow.    Legos.
The hero we don't deserve, but who we need
I need the 4 min Joker come on yall we almost there

No disrespect but, is there a way you can make feature with Aminé check him out. He's lit like you. He reps like you. He spits like you. But not a duplicate.
where do you stay?
the city of angels
Man this sound is really great. I appreciate the lyrics because they are true. It hurts when people get some fame but decide to disrespect you when you had always been by their side but choose the fakes instead. People disappoint me. I would rather you be you than you to be someone with short lived fame but acts brand new. I'm  true to myself I don't care what no one says. I'll dance and sing in the middle of the street like a madman and let people think I'm crazy (which I am).

Keep up the good music
What's up bro
You're the only Hip Hop artist I follow or even listen to for that matter because of how real you are in your lyrics. You speak so much TRUTH in such a brilliant and artistic way. It pulls me close to the screen to try and catch every word you're saying. Well done Dax, never stop speaking such pure TRUTH that needs to be said among the entertainment community. I hope your following multiplies by a 1000! Never lose yourself. Take care!
Dax is a goat

Dax, I don't think you will ever know how much you influence me and others. I remember crying outside my house while listening to you while going through some hard times. It's crazy how much of an impact someone can have on someone else when you relate to them. Thank you 💗

The wordss here need to be heard by our youth and helped to understand they pertain to gang life as well if not more than fame. im a man who spent 22 yrs locked up and highly involved with a orginization that the feds took a bite out of using the RICO act. convicted of a gang related murder, i sought after hood fame. hood politics and fame seem the same in  my eyes. i can only pray my kids ive just had have your drive and not my ambitions. your words keep me centered at times of stress knowing im not alone, thank you!!!!! being a native american living on a reservation has me feeling so isolated especially being from a big city. again, thank you!!!!!

thank-you Dax!!!  anyway,,, (life goes on)... hint hint, 2pac remix song idea. you haven't done one in a fat min.  up the beat and make it yours do it justice. you are the only one that can do this properly i chose that song for two reasons one cuz  as 2020 is coming to an end and two it will be a challenging song and i figured you could use a challenge.
Love to see you working hard it inspires me to work as hard as can in football

Real talk would love to hear a track with Dax and NF. Both legendary lyrical geniuses. Imagine combining the two.
new song is sick as f! keep the good music coming please xD
love the song, when we gonna see big big collabs?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
You’re the illest rapper the world has ever seen, killing the haters and slaying the scene, talk about things that have been left in the dark, things people don’t talk about due to the condition of their heart. Truth comes out when it’s brought to the light, secrets create bullshit, negativity and hype, I enjoy every single song I hear you create, but if I’m being honest with myself some of my foundations you shake. But I appreciate your ability to make me think, it takes courage to stray from the mainstream stink. If I ever rap my lyrical flows, I hope we can get together and create a collaboration/duo
💯💯💯‼️
Everybody like the vid with all of ur alt accounts too so we can get 200k likes by tmr!

my bro thinks u suck but i love ur music it inspires me
This song in the Gotham Knights game uffff
So next album is Batman related or wat joker now this what's next Riddler's ride this is getting corny bruh
This guy has inasane energy. He's probably metahuman. I baffle at how much he churns out consistent stuff regularly at the same great momentum.
Gonna be truthful , I personally don't like dax , but this song really changed my mind , u a G my guy
Im on my way dax.
Was that his Halloween costume ?
i dont think there is anyone better at the moment. For me, its not as good as "Joker", but still very good.
Hell yeah man, another masterpiece.
@dax you really killing it bro
welcome to california... sorry i mean gotham
Dax the beast is back 💪🏽
Dax 🔥
Damn dax looks dope in that suit he's ussaly half dressed lol but he outdid himself again which I didn't even think was possible but I think I've learnt not to doubt dax at anything at this point :)
This song should be added to the gotham knight's game
very nice bro
This Is FACTS
Boring
Oooops the song z gud

Dax is really more of a spiritual human, it requires a level of spirituality to recognize what's wrong and put it down so well in a song as he does 👌🎶

Let me tell you something you probably didn't notice. See when Dax went into the elevator with these girls and he put the blue check? If you see carefully he acts happy when they come to him and try to take a photo but after that he walks out disappointed and sad..... This is the truth

Dax just created JOKER 2. And i love it
Red wine
I don’t wanna be famous because if your famous what if you have kids how do you think their lives are gonna be hiding from the outside world trying to protect them from everyone who wants to be with them. How will they make friends, how will they see family they will just comes to the families home. That why I don’t want to be family I wouldn’t want anything to happen to my kids when I grow
This song is so authentic 🔥

This coming from Dax feels really spiteful
*straight outta Dax’s YT story*  How does this legend still hasn’t hit 200k likes yet??
WHO DISLIKED IT
This video and message is amazing 🔥💪
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Half of my spotify playlist are your songs man 👍🧡
This some NF shit and it bangs
So good Good music 💯🐐
i wanna see a bts
❤❤❤
💯💯💯💯💯
Love this so true 🖤⚡
I love this song
HELLO!? I need everyone to like and share this now please! If he gets 200k likes he's gonna give us 4 more minutes of joker...if yall make me miss that im gonna cry 😢
I love the contrast where in JOKER he’s playing as the Joker, waving a knife around putting his haters on the spot, and in GOTHAM he’s playing the Jokers opposite, Batman, saving lives (well, at least himself), and refusing to be consumed by the algorithm, or aka the chaos in the world of Batman and joker, and telling us about those who’ve been consumed by the algorithm, just like the Joker, who was consumed by chaos and violence.
I think I've watched this video atleast 50 times now.
Nigga so lyrical u feel his music 💯‼️
Yooo  Dax
This song actually fire
Dax doesn't get enough recognition ❤️
This one really touches 😭😭😭
Dang it... I thought we would be able to get the 200k likes so he releases the other part of joker.. Sad
Can't think of a better title
The title is bringing  people in
this song is so good  dax is one of the best rappers man
Wow last time is was 7k now 1 million  Wow Dax  Again, an unbeatable  GOAT
Good rap steyl  ↗️↗️↗️Hot from 🇹🇿🇹🇿
Dax of and when you have an African tour, please pass by Kenya🇰🇪. Your music is real and you speak facts💯. God bless you man
This young man is good
Dax and all, i wasn't a fan. but this song is so impactful;, i started a rap career and now I doubt myself? I doubt my talent? Cause this is next level. And i'm afraid
1.2 million views, please just like
Another one that got a young man like me thinking i been tryna make myself a better person and this song makes me relate to all words spit and The flow and For the young people like me that think that this don't make sense maybe slow down and take the time actually listen to the lyrics
I love it.....RESPECT
we have to get this to 200k likes, cmon people
my man does the same formula on every song, dax stans please don't attack me but he is way too talented but he won't leave his comfort zone and use his versatility he always makes these "woke" songs for 14yo suburban kids who think they have big problems and are oldheads before reaching 30 i just wanna see this guy make a trap banger with some cool melodies and just have fun and not just do the same ol shit, dax mate u could be a great of the here, the now, and the future, but you choose to do the same woke shit for mandem who are stuck in the past, jump on a drill beat, jump on a nasty trap beat, don't shit on people who do that, but do it yourself, you are smart and very talented guy, don't waste that, and if you see this, make something fun like the popping cypher but talk about shit that more people wanna listen to, again i can see you with a bet award or a grammy in your hand if you leave your comfort zone, don't waste your time on a genre that's slowly dying, make the most of your talent, i wanna see you remembered in 50 years as a modern legend like gucci of offset or thugger or future don't just be another jay electronica and be forgotten in 2 years, much love and i hope u take the advice of a fan who wants to see you flourish, do your best
You a real g greetings from turkey izmir
Dont know the lyrics but listening this for the 3 time,Killed it dax
Wow Dax, your getting better each time
Just wow bro it’s so good
Not tryna be a loser or whatever but I prefer the banger songs more. The ones where u would actually listen to everyday. No hate to this song or dax though still a good true song
Man's a lyrical genius, and speaks real facts 🔥🔥🔥. He won't stop and will come up with another banger.
i came from no life shaq and i listens to this on repeat on :)

#musicislife
"Fake shit goes viral we know this won't"
💯😓🧠
🔥🔥🔥
Great Video...
low key copied eminems flow from 8 mile at 2:12
Lol he did the bat-suit wayy better than travis
This type of music changes our society and opens our eyes for so many fake things ....such art of talent is rare...it takes a guardians heart to protect his people.. #dax .....will keep on sharing the truth.
IN GOTHAM JUST BE VERIFIED AND YOUR FRIENDS FAKE
I m Addicted 😫  That Hook, Damn  Dax U r A Criminal Dude  U fu*king killed That Beat
Awesome song, like always. Keep Going <3

INCREDIBLE SIRR RESPECT 💯💯💯💗💗
It’s rap but it rocks!
I don't want to be famous, I don't want materialistic things, I don't want to be "Verified", I don't want money to spend on my wants, I don't want to be cold, I don't want to be hot, I don't want to be somebody.  I want to be me, I want to have a heart for people, I want needs, I love my Family. Even if I'm sick, I'll still try my best, accomplish what I started from the beginning of my life to the end of my life.
Does anyone know if he is signed or a solo artist ? Id like to. Contact his label his music vibes with mine i need someone who wants something differnt not a mold to make them money and follow trends.
Yours song are like dose of drugs for me.. just need them. Absolute Fire.
Just because someone have money or friends, doesn't mean he/she's famous.
If not dax, then what is music?
#thatsdax the man with messages in he's songs, the man of facts.
We are waiting for that joker 2 wholeheartedly 🤗🤗
We need to show real love to him
Dax loved it why don't you check your instagram dm
Dear God DAX made it again in GOTHAM ❤
Lets go for the 200k likes so we get the joker other half ❤️
Fye
Just what I expected good lyrics that tells a story
I just want money that  will be enough for me to take care of my family, buy things I want, travel to anywhere I want, being famous was never the plan
If only I could like this song 70k more times so we could get the other 4 mins of joker, this song go hard
A lyrical genius.
Why does dax remind me of a new gen eminem 🤔🤷🏼‍♂️
Dax you're so good wannabe make music with you .diehard fan.watching from srilanka.
Most inspiring rapper at the moment.
@lisa atkins according to the article many of the african american celebrities in hollywood lighten their skin using  a japanese skin lightening lotion that made their dark natural skin look like much lighter like mixed race or bi racial but they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/1-best-seller-extra-strength-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml what i dont understand is why deny  that they are using this lotion?unless they want people to think they naturally light skinned or something.
ngl ive listened to this song at least 15 times already, the first beat change when the piano comes in, theres something about it that hits me everytime and i be like "damn! that is fire"
Everybody like the song next I don't know about you but I wanna here the other part of joker that he left out
I literally can't stop listening to dis song
Another banger
Wow, one of the most accurate songs I've ever heard in my life.
Like the vid and sub to Dax he is one of the best rappers.
Dax your song have meaning and a lot of artists don’t do that I have level respect for you and music you make keep it up
Je suis le seul fr sinon je te kif continue comme ça
I’ve always felt like people have character profiles It’s like if you have bad stats then no one gives a shit

It's official Dax needs to have a comic made of him as an else world version of Gotham with someone else as his sister Gotham girl
I BELIEVE ¡¡¡
Happiness is not a physical place you call Home
Fire!!!
Love from India ❤️🇮🇳.
This song is actually really deep glad to see the goat Dax spitting the facts
DAX IS BACK🔥🔥
This is straight 🔥🔥🔥
This marks the end of my mind imprisonment,I gonna make better moves Nice inspiration Dax🤗
Dax is speakin faxs but why the hell would I want to be famous and be annoyed all the time on social media and famous people mainly become famous for the money so it wouldn't make any sense to want to be famous.smh
Dax your one of the reason why i’m still here... I’ve thought about suicidal thoughts the past few weeks but people like you are keeping me alive because of the music you make. Thanks man Keep it up to help people like me that are suicidal thoughts. Edit: Dax you should have posted this on halloween
Am listening to Gotham while in Kenya 254 with proud 🎭
Dax you speaking big fax this stuff is serous
Just a few Dax quotes “Fake is real and they say real is fake woke”  “What did you expect when dumb people got smart phones”  “You wouldn’t know real if it slapped you right in the face”  “They won’t give you no credit because they know you’ll use it”  “If you ain’t got a blue Check then you ain’t anybody”  “They gonna build you to break then rebuild you to break”  “Blind people leading blind people driving cars to a Destination that is unclear while they can’t steer”  “happiness is not a physical place you call home” (the best one)  “did you wonder why you feel like you feel when you take that time way from your phone”  “fake shit goes viral we know this won’t”  “they will say they care but will never show”  Dax
Please get this to over 200k people 🙏
When is em gonna name drop dax? I know he sees it!!!
It feels good to know your blowing up now, so glad I've known you for a while now but now we gotta deal with people who don't understand the message and put a bad name on It all and then all the OG's are "on the bandwagon"
Dax has outdone himself yet again
Indians we want joker like it
New to the Dax fam. This is sick dude🔥🔥🔥🔥 keep it up dax❤️
It's DAX indeed 💥💥💥
Dax if the GoAt👌👌💥💥✌
All the dislikes are from people who live in Metropolis.

Bot?
This man is LEGENDARY 🙏🔥 and WILL forever BE...
up up up
Love it dude. Im glad you're recovering from your pain. Stay up Dax 💪🏻💪🏻
Omg my soul just melted playing this track.... You got talent beyond this generation ears. Thank you Dax for your awesome talent and how you choose to express yourself. Sending nothing but good vibration and love your way.

Dax is so underrated asf. Like if you agree
Let’s Be honest when does Dax drop A song and it’s not 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Always so real bro

Dax op 🤯
Yes!
Honestly. Im starting to like dax now.
Comment
Every word is a fact
You straight dawg? I love your music. It's relatable. Just wanna make sure you cool.
🔥
Bro this man speaks the coldest fax it’s kinda scary😬
Yo his last video was on August 19th and this came out on October 29th, so I might be dumb but isn’t that 40 days? Like he said in his song? Edit: I skipped a month stfu
I'd love to jump on a remix
You're my favorite rapper and I hope you blow up even more 😊
Fucking amazing
This song is fire 🔥 brotha ❤️🖤💚
Big fan mr DAX 😎 Um from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
I think everyone who used the internet needs to hear this. Great job Dax.
i just want to make beats that people enjoy.. :)
If Machine Gun Kelly uses the style he used for “Smoke and Drive” and Collabs with Dax. That could be the hit of the year. Their voices match for good song.
So relevant
DAX gotham    ↗↖↗↖↗↖↗↖  ♨   hip hop rap sound ⚫ play ▶▶🎧      ♠       🎵 ) ) ) )
i gotta say i have talked bad on dax but he really came back with this bop
Dope shit as usual Dax🔥
Dax spits straight facts
This is the twenty-fourth time listening
🔥
Better than most of the mainstream artists people listen to. You’re a goat man. I love you
I don’t want to be famous just want have enough money to support my family and save my family if anything goes upside down ..
He went hard Gotham is life
Fk the algorithm "We are the label", now lets confuse Youtube  with how the fan base is stronger than its stupid algorithm
Cute clip
“You listen to these people that got nothing to say,”  Damn that is so real.
This is amazing 🔥🔥I love love this 💥raw talent
Dax is awesome. New gen GOAT. And I dont say that lightly.    But this man is consistent in his music and definitely worthy of carrying the torch.   For this generation he and Joyner really be doing it for me.    Of course Kxng Crooked and Tech amd Joel Ortiz these guys are goats period. But Dax for the new gen hes good to stand among leaders.    I have yet to hear a wack song from this man. Keep killing it and ill keep supporting
I keep coming back to watch this again and again❤🔥
This is really good
Dax I have been listening since catch me outside remix you have came a long way we’ll deserved love the music keep it up 👍
DAAAMNNNN DAX THIS WAS FUCKING FIREE🔥🔥🔥
Thank you for producing a piece which moves the souls of many. You're life changing and that's brilliant !
When Sow the notification about the song I didn’t think much about it but today right now was my first time i heard this I would have wished I would have listen to it and when I came out Dax pls listen your music has so much meaning to it so many people can relate to it pls continuing to make hella good songs and don’t let any one tell you to stop 🛑 love you bro stay safe 🐐
Real rap music with a point and a purpose
This song is all facts , much love dax
Keep doing what your doing bro
Dax been Choppin but this one special. Next level intelligence coupled with the flow. Welcome to the next level as far as I'm concerned. Had some other good stuff... this is genius.
KSI is King
QUESTION mark. !?
I'm oldschool.  But I must say this is very good Mr. Dax.  Real versus fake will always be a relevant topic and Dax reminds us that indeed 70% of the world is full of fake 🐑🐑🐑.  And that is true.  That is reality. Peace from SoCal Dax ✌🏿 Keep up the good work, don't stop.
u spitting them truth bullets Dax!!! Love from Burundi!!!
You can never hate Dax, he speaks the truth and facts.
Love it Dax! Big message with a lot of heart at always. Thank you!!!
bro ion understand how ppl think actual lyrics are trash. i get looked down on bc I like songs with words and meaning. stay strong vro Dax we gotchu back.
Sick
Look its Hopsin
This song makes me look at who I'm subscribed to differently because most of them have well over a million subscribers, its sad to think that somebody would give away themselves to be famous, they don't realize they are going to burn for eternity until it's to late. Dax is different though because we know he wont because he has control, God bless you man.
Sounds good. I really like it!
Would be the perfect song for a new batman movie... especially the hook! this is fire 🔥
Hey ♥️ I dont want to be famous if I do I would want to be well known that if I do something to change the world that everyone would notice it but not everyone because fame can lead you to do bad things so I would just want to be well known that's all
Reminds me of that Jason Todd scene
HIT 200K LIKES DAX SAID IF GOTHAM HITS 200K LIKES BY TUESDAY HE WILL RELEASE THE OTHER 5 MINUTES OF JOKER THAT HE DIDNT RELEASE YET SO LIKE UP BECAUSE I WANNA SEE JOKER 🃏
No futuro quero ver Dax feat Eminem
Gotham is Los Angeles city of angels; although the sinner state is Nevada. I don’t know nevertheless the song is dope. About how badly someone wanna be famous or someone wanna do something insane which a person could get hurt or die because of fame.
Wasnt a fan but u got my ears now. Im listening!
who felt it to.... Crazy how this brother still isn't mainstream.... Well ....mainstream is mainstream isn't it....But comes with a price
We need a rap called metropolis now 🔥🔥🔥
Fan from India... Drop me a Heart Man ♥️
Dax keep it up great work everyday you make my heart race and it's a good thing and you make my day when I listen to your music
you are the definition of GOAT. your a god bro. we need more rappers like you
Dax is my fav of all time he speaks the truth and make it known
Calculating how much they come and take 💯
What’s sad is the only times I feel free from this shit is when I take psychedelics, it’s such a strong collective vibration it’s disgusting, I know our civilization will see greater days though
Straight fire my dude 🔥🔥
We have to get 200k likes to get the rest of joker
Like 4 the next half of joker
Personally I love the feel of this song and the melody as well.
I have this on replay since it's been released.  I feel like I'm the 1.1m lol
I never thought some other human being relates to this as me
This world is sad
This is facts u can never tell if u can tell if someone is real they just want money and fame they will do whatever it takes dad is a real one ✨🔥
This is straight up an amazing video, such a way of capturing the words into a music video like honestly that is just beautiful to see you actually understand what you mean when most rappers just add random shit in the background you got perfectly placed structure
Such a shame for who dislike this mans
You are a genius, Dax! Save yourself before saving someone else—This is an excellent concept you bring forward to society.  I hope so many more will grasp on and listen to your ingenuity! There's so much here! Thank you for the insight into your journey of life!
Dax I love everything you are doing. These mumble rappers on the radio are clowns and have earned no respect. You keep it up and you'll be in the same category as Eminem.  Much love to Montana of 300, Hopsin, NF...
🔥🔥🔥 he don't miss
I love you're music. It has an actual story behind the lyrics and you dont just say somthing because it rhymes there is a reason for every word.
omg bro he don't miss 🔥😭😂
Ay dax keep it up man you dint have to believe me but we all love you
I dropped to the floor when he said “that’s what happens when the master starts fearing the student” .... OH LORD , TRUE LYRICS
This is a masterpiece I'm digging your music you have improved a lot Keep it up
People NEED TO HEAR THIS !!!! 👏👏👏👏👏
Love you ma man so relatable
I was your #1 fan since day one and that's the fxckin' truth your the fxckin' best. In your rap career your not gonna be brought down but your gonna rise to the top like a king sitting on the highest throne 👑
I am late but this really hits man. Ion want to say much but that blue check line really is truth
"Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel when you take that time away from your phone".  Too true
This might be my favorite now idk anymore lol, keep it up making music that "speaks" 🔥 unlike these wanna be rappers talking about the same shit every song they release
super cool 🐼
Love your music bro 🐐🔥🔥
YOO THIS IS FIRE!! KEEP IT UP MAN!
Someone took the new Batman trailer a little to seriously 😂 good song tho
Dax really outdid himself
On God lifes a simulation
Right on Dax you killin it keep up the great work I love your music you should think about making a album
HE'S  AMAZING
Dax never miss 🔥 and his lyrics always meaningful, man a real GOAT!
Gotham = Gathom
Deeply relatable song. This is the best 🔥
This song is so true its soo good and its on a whole different level
🔥💯💯
Can we please hit 200k in likes I wanna see that video 🙏
ThatsDax
Dax don't let nobody tell you how your feelings work
WOW!  My mouth just stayed open when he (paraphrase) saying that fame in the city of stars bring more trouble like gold diggers and folks who want to put you in play on the basis of how much they think you have or can bring to their pocket.  Haters being liars that post and scream loud enough for the lies to become truth becuz we are so messed up we will listen to those artist, but not real life giving lyricists like him.  WOW!   There is a following must smaller than those listening to real motivating lyricists and that is no cap.  THX DAX!  LA, NY and other Gotham destinations. Have done only what can be done with artists like you.  To move aside so yous can independently make your own lane for those who are more than booty poppers and not real stoppers like you - NF, Hop and few others.  YOUS have created a lane that is a newer mainstream still.
#Dax this one  it's  No1 perfection 💯💯💯 You deserve the belt bro Keep it going  💥💥💥💥💣
He's different, he's unique he IS DAX!!!
😃☺👊🏽🖖🏽🧡✨🎉🎉
Finally got around to watching and listening to this song and I'm so glad I did,another amazing song Dax,keep up the great work!
Well done Jax from MK
🖤
The 1.9k dislikes the ones who gon go through this 💔
This is honestly the best song I have heard all day. I know I’m late and I regret it. I wish I heard this way earlier to make my day easier. Dax you really are probably the most lyrical rapper in 2020 my G. Keep this up, it’s definitely working for you brother. ❤️💯♾🔥
didnt expect that,  wow what a lyrical adventure 🔥🔥🔥
"Ain't nobody see u till u get 1 million followers" is so true unless u are verified or well known no one wants to know u or wants to be with u when u have that 1 million followers it all changes everyone wants to be with u and know u, this track is🔥🔥 glad to have dax back I needed some good music to listen too
Dax  feel like Dax puts time and effort into his song like other rappers coming out with songs every week and saying the first word that comes to mind but Dax already has words in his mind and that’s why his songs are blessed peace and love to anyone that reads this🙏🙏🙏
https://youtu.be/Y44dQnypUhM
I take back my last comment. Dax is truly in a league of his own.  This video showing that you have to be your own light in dark times was so deep. While using the Gotham reference to symbolize the evil of LA.  MASTERPIECE!
Trash 🗑 jk
IT'S FAX
Woah
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥 Another Big Message From The BIG Dawg💯💯💯🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Love you dax you are legendary bro
Dax speaks nothin, but truth!
lol goddamn first time he has changed that set from a street
I love the way you built up the setting of corruption in "Gotham" and then linked it to a mindset in that last verse. The whole song was real but if you were in mortal kombat, that was the fatality.
Dax is one of the most energetic kidnapped person I've ever seen
this song should be at 100 m right now <33
I love your content and you’re a fast rapper
I CAN WATCH THIS VIDEO A WHOLE DAY
"You wouldnt know real if it slapped you right in the face" if that ain't true
Great song
Let’s get this legend to 3M please 🙏🏽🔥🔥✊🏽
This man is a legend no cap ✊🏽
All facts no cap
I wonder if he was a janitor...
I am French and I just discovered you, I love your musical work, it's huge !!
Agreed brother. Good stuff! Keep waking em up man!
I love Dax..he's good
Dax a goat that can’t be hunted down 🙏🏾
Too hard bro❤️🔥We weren't ready for this
This is literally how I'm feeling about society.. a complete description about 21st century and people 🔥 At least someone is saying all the truth through music, amazing!  Love your creations!
Dax is so under rated
So in this video you pretend  to get kidnapped to get clout (selling his soul) just to save yourself for more clout but playing both parts
🔥
Next track for next batman/ suicide squad reboot.PURE ART!!!
Keep up the great work good job on 1.1 million views in 2 days
He went from being Joker to being Joker’s victim to being Batman
Song fire bro, keep makin more bangers
Until you realize the price to get fame 🔥🔥🔥
Keep putting out that truth!!!!! I love ur passion from ur start to here. I can't wait to c u preform live!!! 💯
Puff was here and mi left a like as always ooosh move 🙏💪🤴PUFF 🤴💪🙏
🤜🏿🇯🇲🤛🏿in GOTHAM☯️💜☯️💜
LETS GET THIS SONG TO 200K LIKESS
Imagine if he responded to me
Dax improves every song.
It’s been 4 years 312 days since I liked a video. That counter has reset to 0
The realest rapper out right now no doubt. It would be cool to get a chance to collab on a track wit dax forreal. One day maybe
It just makes so much sense and I just really hope this gets to 200k cause I really love the joker song ik exited to see if we can make it.
This should be the batman theme song
I dont know if this is true but is that another little detail you put in there? From 1:00-1:10 the two girls or at least the one on the right with the makeup is supposed to be poppy right? The same youtuber who tried to do videos on how corrupt the music industry is
Absolutely love it.❤😍
this song slaps hard bro keep up it man i littealy have this on loop that good

this IS m'y 6th Time listening to this ❤️🙏🙏🙏
Dax u the bomb bro love your shit as its so real and I can relate
Dax Interview Article 2017  He called it..  https://www.kansas.com/sports/college/state-college-sports/article133958499.html
Dam bro!!!!! DC Should contact you... #Should be in the next Batman Movie #Fan from 🇬🇾🇬🇾🇬🇾🇬🇾
Patiently waiting for 200k likes. We need that unreleased part of Joker😭❤️
Are you part of the Illuminati? There’s a couple of music videos where you symbolize the all seeing eye
When he slapped the verified check on him and the girls started talking to him was genius
people better learn from this song
Charli demilo has no talent
🔥🔥🔥
Dax is back with the bars🙏🏾🔥🔥🔥
See I could say that this song is deep, but the truth is a lot of people are just shallow. However, everyone stays in the shallows, until you learn how to swim. Only then can you dive deep.
REAL ARTISTRY ! VISIONARY!
U read this without like ing the video
Get to 200
I couldn’t have put it better very good message
Amazing song!
So relatable 😞😢
Dude such a banger
When juice wrld was alive him and Dax would make perfect friends and if they partnered up to make a song it would probably be number one on the charts
Pretty poggers ngl
I'm thoroughly impressed.
It's funny how the comments with more likes has a verification Check mark next to their names... It's not a coincidence, Dax is spitting Fax
I was playing apex legends listening to spotify in the background and this song came on, I was in far fragment east  "Life's a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer Blind people leading blind people driving cars To a destination that is unclear while they can't steer" I've never opened up my spotify app faster like wow.. This song really hit...
*WOW* JUST WOW ITS REAL AF.. i love how Dax is ràw wit it💜💯🌹

To be fair the eye mask is kind of pointless while that hair is still visible lol
If fake shit is the only thing that goes viral I hope this is the one exception
We got the main man IT'S DAX You always willing to put out what we're too scared to say. Keep winning bro. Much love ❤
Mad respects Dax  . THIS is music .Keep up the good work man .Greetings from Greece 🇬🇷

The only artist in the world that likes the comments .
Wow! This song is speaking facts. In my opinion what I get from this video is that Gotham is society. No body knows you when you’re down and out like Leslie Odom jr. song says. When you have money and fame everyone is your long lost friend. Wow this song just makes me really think.
Dax has never failed to speak facts.  Dude is incredible! New it since day one💯❤
I support dax in everything that he is doing cause his speaks spoke words and he is also been underrated. 💓 u man
He spitting faxxx!!💯🔥
Dax is unpredictable!

Dax describe fact of gohtam . Lyrics are soooo good . Well done dax
BEST SONG EVER 🎵
He speaks Facts💯
Deep shit man! I dont get the social media fame and you put it into perfect words! Love it man!

Heh, did the clowns come after you because of your super makeup from Joker?) Why would you kill them if they just needed a singer like you)
I really feel these lyrics, good job on this song
When did dax acc get really fucking good
In Gotham everybody knows everybody (Everybody) If you ain't got a blue check, you ain't anybody (F*ck). 🦇🎃 Amazing!
❤️❤️❤️
My Man👊🏿👏🏿🙌🏿

Hey man you do you! Fuck the numbers dude, you're on fire!! I love your flow. My whole family listens to you. Joker was badass!!! We want more!
Rip
This shit is 🔥 🔥 keep up the amazing work man always been listening to you from the start love everything you do 💪
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I’ve always said Dax is a good artist. Haven’t always liked him as a person (from the things I’ve seen from him on the internet) but his music recently is showing a lot of inner personal growth, I feel like he really is evolving as a person. Nothing but respect for that. 🖤
❤️
This sounds just like Washington state
Yoooo everybody like the somg
Even a hater must like this one 🔥🔥🔥
Bro Dax is a goat. He gonna kill every beat he raps.💯👌
UNDERRATED RAPPER
How this not trending???
The Cinematography Alone in this video rivals the storytelling of any movie
Love your Music!!
Killed !!! it well deserved  success you can’t deny the  lyrical talent came a long way from 2pac remixes.
Pure Skill
REAL G.
REAL RAP. 🔥
Keep liking people!!!!! 🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🆓🆓🆓🆓
needed this 💕
Yes. This is fire!
You already know this is going to the playlist, and this beat is fire
I love when Dax drops a song like this
Dark horse, goat.
Is this 432hz or a good frequency
This generation is messed up!People only care about money,drugs,alkohol,sex and killing.Who know what is next...Glad to see someone is still in right place.
Now I'm your fan😊🔥😻😻
The only champion 💯👑
I thought this song was just about dc super man Batman etc but it got su much deeper
Yoh the message in this one is strong💪💪I keep replaying it
God damn Daniel. This is goosebump wrenching. "Body shaking" good. At the very end where you sing for a second, holy shit. 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Dope!!!!!
This is one of the best rap songs ever. Love from Ghana🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
*PLEASE LIKE THE SONG SO HE CAN RELEASE JOKER PART 2!!!!*
And I didn’t even catch one “IT’S DAX!”
Dax just keeps getting better props bro !🔥
God damn Dax back at it wit da truth 💯🚫👌💪🙏🔥
Jesus, no other artist makes me think like you do, Dax. Been a fan since Self Proclaimed 3, and your growth since then has been insane. I don’t think you know how much of an inspiration you are.
My bro, I've been here since them Tupac days. You're killing it my g, you'll be number 1 on charts soon trust me!
This is why I love Dax and Joyner They are real
Dax bro give me a heart😈
Your gifted partna, Another classic 🔥
I love this song so much today is my Bday 14 today and ima bump this all day
do you like ksi’s music?
This is fucking so relatable
As a response to the question in the beginning of the video, almost more than anything. But not for what comes with fame but for my family as well as my friends. And as a response to this song, really shows you are one of the best lyricist to ever do it (i say that as humble as possible)
One of the best things I've heard..The bitter Truth💯💯☮️
You read my mind. This the most authentic verbal portrayal of our present global society. Love from British Columbia, Canada. Keep speaking for the voiceless, Dax. 💯 💯 💯
Heard u talked to my lil homie robert from nc before u blew up on ig i liked ur shit before he told me that but now im a even bigger supporter dog just cuz i feel u care about fans thats whats good i just wish i had a studio i dont need any recognition just want to vibe and kill this anxiety i watch my daughter die in a car wreck in 2013 amd been fucked ever since got all the way clean begging of this year and ive never beem happier just deal with anxiety bad need that music
Now this is you back my G dax is a legend just needs to keep the consistency absolutely love all ur music and I just want my favourite rapper to stay on top like u deserve would be great to get a reply back from u as u have no idea how it would feel to have a reply from my idol who has lit up and made these past few years a lot better for me with the music u release and stories u tell to everyone and it always 100 percent relatable in next to every song u write and the daxnation love every word u spit on ur tracks
Somehow I relate pretty hard
All this shit is  So real it’s not even funny.
Dax your music is so relatable and makes so much sense and I’m so young and your music is changing me
1st: Joker 2nd: Gotham  3rd: Batman??
Ok apparently Dax likes every comment but if he really liked 12k comments (currently 12k comments) or at least like 200 Lol he is fucking insane.
Good stuff  Keep going
A true Artist, Thanks for the heads up
Bro if you don’t reach 200k likes i still want the 2nd half of joker idc what you say lol
I love your content as always 💙☺️
Cool
Please drop the remaining part of joker please 🙏 You're the greatest rapper of all time I mean it when I say that Just make me happy by keep it going ❤️
Dax is the best rapper right now
Hes on to something here
🔥🔥
"Fake shit goes viral we know this won't" Let's prove otherwise folks !
Everything you've seen on TV was exaggerated ..... Damn Dax 🛑🛑🛑🛑
love the nod to Batman carrying a dead Jason Todd.
200k like please
Prayer is our most powerful gift! Gotham maybe a state of mind, but we live in the devil's playground. I'm in this world, not of it. God Bless, and I will keep praying for you Dax.
Am really looking forward to the other half of joker that's my favorite one of your songs
This song is too good for people tbh
I found Dax through his Joker song. That song got my curiosity this song gave you my full attention.
DAXMAN to the rescue!
This should play in a batman movie
DAX IM GLAD UR FAMOUS FINALLY
Dax x tokyosrevenge   Gotham part 2 come on
bro this song is firer
Get 200k likes on this. We need more dax content
Keep killing it man every one of your songs have a stronger story then any other
You mean in The Matrix!!!
Dax is so underrated its not funny. Thats why im having trouble rekindling my passion for music. The ones of us with talent get overlooked for nobodies cause they look like circus clowns and sing/rap about garbage or shit they dont really be living
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How I called you BATMAN OR Blackman?        PS=just a joke. Ok
Pleas can you make a new song pleas
hi dax i love your music
i always wanted to be famous now I know I kinda am thinking about that again 🧡🧡🧡
He gets hate because he’s not a mumble rapper. Plus all his haters are unsuccessful in life/uneducated, because if they weren’t, they’d be too busy making money to worry about another mans progress.
i love this song. You are a really good artist your songs have sooooo many meaning my life is so hard. I mean I just got out of a mental hospital because of my parents. this helps me ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh so you reply to ur fan? prove it then💪💪💪💪
Nice bro
Wow!!
I feel like Dax is always getting his ass beat
thank you for teaching us another lesson like you do in every song being famous isn't all good like they say. Love you dax❤️❤️❤️
OMG Bruh this song hits
If this song doesn't go viral then idk...
When life gets real you'll remember all these words I wrote 💘
Daamn this song is soo realatable💯🔥
Dax back at it again 🔥 💯 keep up the work bruv
THE BEST SONG OF 2020 (Obviously after Eminem xD)
Dax!! always singing and rapping about something relevant and meaningful.. speaking the truth and so talented.. by far my favorite rapper!!
Every piece of work this man puts out is tooo real 🔥
Execution 👌🏾
His music is not only a beat and words. He has facts, story, and visuals behind all his music. Dax never fails to amaze me. Keep up the great work bro. 💯🙏
I LOVE THIS SHIT!!!!

Sisi wote ni konokono 😄🤔https://youtu.be/AmYiFLpWluo
I've been anti-violent but don't push me 'cause I just might do it (Don't push me) DAX I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it. Eminem I ain't a killer, but don't push me Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy. 2pac
Free beats 🔥🔊🎧🇲🇦🇮🇹
Man you need to go make movies you got  skills at that batman part
This is the best thing ever in 2020

Jamaa anajua sana
Best rapper ......reality🐐
I cant get over thus track bro, just like every other of your songs i keep it on repeat ❤️ your music doesn't deserve to be called a song, a song is just words with a beat, but with what you do it should be called life lessons because what you say can touch souls and hearts, it can inspire people no matter who they are, I've played your stuff to everyone i know and now they are hooked on you, my g i really wish i could do what you do, im really not that good in achieving success no matter how hard i try an till today i try just because of you, you give me the reason and proof that a person can achieve success if they try as hard as they can, bro u got all my love and respect, im forever in your debt, i owe you, when i achieve my success you the first person i will think of, because you are the one who helped me through it all, bro people may say i dont mean all this but bro from where i stand i got no time to play games with my idol, i will soon become the person i want to be and you will be the reason, thanks for it all #Dax
Best song in this world i swear i felt ever letter ❤️
This song speaks how I feel now a days
#Dax 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💞💞💞
#Dax 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💞💞💞
God level shit🔥🔥🔥🔥

Straight fire 🔥
Dax this was amazing bro 🔥

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, give him your life he can change everything.
The fight scene would have been dope.  Then I see a big ass mop flopping around on his head xD
This song is fireeee 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️so many facts up in this song 💯
This song hits hard
this is absolutely incredible, i can see how much this means to dax, your speaking truth, i really loved this music. the detail is so good, this is your best work yet !!! keep up the incredible work, and dont let anyone stop or let you down <3
I just recently found Dax when I was going through some hard times in life. Three of his other songs I’ve listen to so many times just on repeat and made a playlist with just those 3. He quickly is becoming one of my favorite artist, this song is absolutely amazing. If you listen to his songs and really listen to the words you can tell very fast that the lyrics come from his heart. I don’t know anything about him or his life/struggles but with my limited knowledge from just a few of his songs. You know he is the real deal, every word has so much meaning and a lot of times words can help people with the struggles of there own life. I know it did for me, I’ve liked and subscribed and will continue following his amazing career moving forward.   He deserves so much more coverage, Ive shared his video links to many people trying to do my part!!!!
I liked the song to try and help this song hit 200k likes
Funny how he’s speaking about most of you ppl that are giving him props.. the sheep
Why does he say Gotham like that
This is awesome  Love from india if you reply I'll shave off my head fr
Dax is definitely one of the best rappers!!!💯
"Fake shit go viral, but this wont"  It better
Nice job your the best
This song is 💯🔥🔥 but y do u always like bleeding in most of ur music video, it's get too much bruh
Every song u just get better and better
Be blessed!
Dax this song is fire
I hope dax is ok

Truly a masterpiece
You tell them Dax! All the bars you spit in this is straight FAX!
The blue check line and talking about a million followers hits hard. Dude I was happy to get a thousand followers on one app but I still feel irrelevant
Slowly starting to become my favorite rapper 👀
The 1.9k dislikes  needs their ears check cause this is lit 🔥
This song fire🔥 spitting Fax
I love you Dax😘
Dax speaking fax’s always
Anyone wonder where  Dax politically stands? Seems like he tries to overall stay away from it and I understand that it’s messy asf. Idk I’m just wondering Big  fan🔥🔥🔥
This song talks fax
Dax thinking about boxing????
Dax, that's one of your best bro, speaking the truth! Respect from Greece!

Dax🔥🔥😎😍

Damn that really good
Great song but I love how YouTube's trying to sell the Gotham show on this video.
🔥
Love it !
Imma start putting my feelings onto paper too cause I’ve been tryna find a release for all the bs that I go through with “friends”. Thanks for inspiration Dax. Stay up✊🏾
Eminem produced some songs for Family Bvsiness (Kxng crooked and The Shoe gang) shits 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
40 seconds of Arm-Pits
Dax is super talented.  Always rolling out amazing concepts.   "Gotham is not a place, it's a state of mind".
I kept repeting the song while I was playing Arkham knight
This is most definitely what we needed to hear and see. I love the vision and the message. Keep going Dax!!!!
DAX IS BACK 💪
Absolute beast of a song. Hits on a lot of different levels
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 You Are a Beast Underrated rapper 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️ Number One Fans From Puerto Rico
Gotham = Hollywood
Dax is comparable with Tech Nine, Just can tell what kind of man he is through his music. Lyrical god's
Thank you
This was great.
This song explain everything...❤️
Chills
Dax.. You are different.  Love from India
Dax saves him selv
This song right here deserves a recognition 🏆
Best plot twist ever
everyone who sees this comment like the video GOTHAM
The end is closer. People want to be famous but they don’t know how hard it is at the end. You’ll be sadder.
This song is fire 🔥🔥🔥
This was worth waiting for
We have a wear mask in school policy me after listen to this....  I AM BATMAN !!!😂😂😂😂
Playback speed 0.25 so I can write down In my brain every word u said.
Well that was fuckin dope!
Truer statement haven't been made 😩💔
Nothing but incredible 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
The fact we place so much value in false deities in many facets of their life to escape their own because they feel it boring.
Like the video!
Like it up!
Legit
The lyrics “Gotham isn't just a place it's a mind state, Watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow” ....leads me to believe that Gotham is the physical realm we are stuck in, if we aren’t able to escape the manipulation of the matrix in our mind. The zombies that are dragging and beating him are a metaphor for his own demons that he’s battling, but also those in the physical Reality that want to tear him down and take his soul. I also noticed that Batman “ Saves The ARTIST Dax”....Dax has lost his own individual identity because he’s getting sucked into the illusion, so Batman is the superhero created in his own mind, to rescue himself from the physical aspect of Gotham. If we are able to snap out of the Gotham in our minds, then We break free from the physical....We manifest our own physical reality with our thoughts. Money, fame, physical possessions and social status are all part of the illusion and mean nothing...happiness is a state of mind and WE really are in control of our destiny. This is why I love you so much....you have had my brain on overdrive for two days and You always make me think! 💕💖
Dax x M Huncho?
Imagine not having a ghost writer and being underrated
The people who disliked   are the girls at 1:09
I hope you realize that you might be saving peoples lives  just by being so real and straight up honest in your music, because being surrounded by so much fake and negativity sometimes us real ones feel really lost and down about the way the world is today. Love that you always stay true to yourself and your fans. Really really appreciate you and your music man
KSI needs to react to this
I'm addicted to this song bro 🔥
Bro u set my house on fire
https://youtu.be/m8xjPoccEjg
Factsss
Is a good song. Dax you are using words that you don’t know their etymology though, for example demon is a Greek word look up its meaning, not the definition that the masters gave us, the actual meaning. Be careful and take care
The belt is on backwards.
I don't know Dax personally but because of all the things he went through like YouTube stuff and the fact that he use to work a job that pays little I love seeing the rise.
dax your in pain I wish I colud help I've seen it in your song
Fake friends get the upper cut haa, Man l understand your creativity and l respect it. Still love the energy, the sync you do with creativity. Few can do that👊🏾
Ended that with A Death In The Family
Nothing but FACTS , NO CAP!!!!  #Dax#2020
the ability to speak on truthful shxt and still maintain the gothem theme is ridiculous 👏🏼💯💯
I like Dax's songs because they talk about what's in the world...
Prove nothing to Gotham.... they ain't done nothing for you
Real shit 🔥🔥keep it sky champ
❤️❤️❤️
Yo, Dax! So dope! You’ve been a beast since the beginning. You’ve got it all. From Beast Mode rapping, life relatable songs, BARZ BARZ BARZ, storytelling, better music videos, awesome remixes that outdo the originals to this...Gotham. It’s my favorite song of yours so far just because from the all around perspective. The whole song is at least a double. You’re ability to tell us the story and show us with amazing visual cinematics. You are definitely in my top 10 as an all around artist. You keep on getting better and better. Keep it up! Happy for your success, so keep bringing them Hits!!!
Best one yet🔥🔥
Amazing
Come on ya got to like it for that joker drop
DAX spitting faxs!!✊
Dax heart this if you believe ill make it in the music game
dax made me want to study poetry
We’re all in Gotham
Well, how in the hell could you dislike this masterpiece? Just go listen to Kid Buu if you don't like this.. smh..
🔥🔥🔥
Cool😈😈😈😈😈
0:36 did anyone here a boy
I want Knox Hill to react to this song, so good. Glad you're returning Dax
I used to be a fan, but after hearing this masterpiece, I'm a whole air conditioner
Use me as a "dax is underrated" button 👇🏽
w
🔥🔥🔥
In all his Music Video his Bleeding 😂
He gets better everyday, preserved through people who never believed in him. Been watching since the begginning. Good work Dax, banger!
This was a decent piece of music. But that's all that it was, just some decent music. If I was to judge just your rapping, I'd say you were great. But you sang too. That would have been fine. But you suck at singing, and that is what brings down the average. I would gladly add to my favorite rap music playlists. But that god awful singing ruined it. And for that I will appreciate your amazing rapping for what it is, just amazing rapping, and I will hold your awful singing against you.
50% DAX 50% BATMAN 100% IN GATOOOOM
GOTAAAAM
The fake hate you but us living in the real appreciate you dax. edin is not a place it's a state of being dax will be the first to achieve it we love u dax keep going.
The Goat💪
Ok but the fact this has barely 1 million views and 122k likes speaks volumes
Imagine having the audacity to dislike a ITSDAX video😤
*Who else is here from the nonstop snapchat adverts?*
Did he watch Gotham on Netflix that’s why he made it and he is also experiencing the same thing as Bruce Wayne? Keep it up my g hope you are feeling good!

Your music deep bro.. all of em
Dax bro, know you be reading this sooner or later. As expected gotham views exploded quick. The lyrics are evident. I not only respect your work, i regard it as moral and social imperative in todays society of Gotham. Plz keep addressing moral and social issues intertwined with (lack of) visions of the masters (really great line master - students). I understood that Chris Hedges wants a word with you. Challas
gotham fans?
1 million... dax out here out performing some niggas claiming to be better rappers
Lyrics on point! This shit so dope!
That "DAX" sign in the sky hella fire🔥💣

My favorite rapper in the world!!! And for real, this song has one of the top 5 strongest lyrics ever in the history of hip hop! 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯 the lyrics portray the actual truth of what state of slavery our mind is in. @Dax we had a short conversation on IG @sberto_rollaco 🙏 would surely be glad if you gave me more responses about the topic we shared that time about #DearGodICantBreathe that you inspired me to record

Its mad how someone like dax isn't as heard as some of the idiots who only rap about fake money fake bitches and an unattainable fantasy which is not even a fantasy the reality is a unattached life that few relate to. We the masses feel each other recognise the struggle and it feels like dax does too hes smart and needs to be elevated so everyone can hear him.

Have you ever thought about collabing with NF?  That would be dope
This man speaks truth, you fit everything there is to know about the price of fame on one song while using Gotham as a metaphor for this prison we call social hierarchy 🙆🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Dax is the realist rapper and this proves it 💯
1M views in 2 days that's pretty fast for dax

What a comeback 💯
Just here for algorithm
This was incredible. Songs that actually make you take a step back and examine your life are few and far between. It's the mark of a true artist to be able to evoke such thought.
Please release the rest of joker
Went and got this in I tunes right away 🤙🏾 shit yea Dax
Your honestly getting better and better
What do you expect when dumb people got smart phones ?
Dax is one of the most woke rappers I know

Don't even mind the auto time used it right fire af keep speaking truth this sht on repeat
SOME NICKELODEON SHIT RIGHT HERE.
this has nothing to do with this song but just in general Dax y don't you slow it down for one song bc in my opinion you sound like a worse Denzle Curry and I know you got the god mindset but your not better than Denzle
I’m a Christian woman and my friend shared this with me. Is there a clean version with no curse words I would definitely share this...
All dax drops is fire and its all so deep and makes so much sense.
The hook in this song sounds so awesome!
That first verse really got me, Dax. Let's take this to another level..do a song with me, an unknown artist with just 207 subscribers and 11 IG followers for no other reason than my shit goes hard and well, your shit goes hard.
One of my favorite artists. Real talent 🔥🔥
From rapping with futuristic and trying to grow to being one of the best ever
Love from India ❤️
🇿🇲
Dope as hell Dax. True artist
Wow thats fire , lyrics that opens the mind
Wak
Nice words bro, nice verbs 🤙 you should make words for sum where there is no God, question existence itself. Not an atheist, but we know there's more than texts and words
Narh man just want enough to get by
A real artist and conscious ♥️
I love dax. He’s not the most talented singer/rapper, but his lyrics just take you away. His story behind every song is amazing. Keep up the good work
🔥🔥🔥💯
Hamilton vibes
Smart clip dope lyrics 🇸🇦
Keep your head up big man, lead the masses...

"you're young now, just wait until you grow old when life gets real you'll remember the words that i wrote". Life is already real, things get real everyday and you don't have to be "old" to experience anything in life😂 btw your not even old💀
Realest song I’ve ever heard
Masterpiece
What did you expect when smart people got dumb phones. 💚🔥🔥🔥💚🎃👻

Amazing song, had to listen to it again without watching the fight scenes because they distracted me from the lyrics lol.
Love ur music 🔥
You the goat dax
Gotta love when music comes around that has something to think about instead of a shit hook and a beat. Music that tests your mental is the best cause it tells a story instead of 90% of everything else just having a vibe 👌.
Dax you can’t be the Joker and Batman 🤦🏼‍♀️ ❤️
Dax my brother, you spit fire on every track you lay lyrics to. Keep grinding, you deserve all the success that comes your way. Much love and respect from MC-KEVI
this song is about how it's not good to want to be famous but the song gets almost 1 million views in 2 days 😂
kansas city gang 🗣💸 glad to see you made it bro
Eminem should get you on a serious track
Holy shit, a Snapchat ad that is fucking fire 😳

You are my Favorite Rapper and biggest inspirational figure in my life.
DAX WAS HERE,WAS HERE AND WILL ALWAYS BE THERE  HE HAS CREATED A LEGACY THAT CAN'T BE WIPED AWAY
The Dax knight returns🔥🔥🔥
FAX
WAIT WAIT WAIT  IF YOU LISTEN CLOSE   GOTHAM IS INSTAGRAM
Wow. Thanks for spreading truth and baring your soul.
At 1:17, he so much FACTS. As a kid i always wondered why is it considered "rude" to ask someone how much they make. Now that i'm older, I realized that when someone asks you, how much you make? What is your job? What car you drive? Etc, what they really are asking is How much respect should i give you? That's why even when i do become a person who do got money like that, only my 2 3 friends and close family in my inner circle will know that. To the outside world, i'll make myself appear as the average person for the most part.
Remember when Dax was puttin out them Tupac songs🔥
Just wanna say @dax  the people who dislike the video are honestly hating because  you speak facts get millions of views and they can’t compare to what your doing I hope everything is good in your life and nothing is wrong and you are happy so have a great day no lie fr plus you the black m&m ya feel me
So did Warner bros give u a check??  Litt
Let’s get this to ah million in 2 days guys replay replay replay🙏🏽💪💪💪‼️🔥

Such a good message, lot a white girls gotta see this😂😂
How can *YOU* be saved and have *ETERNAL LIFE?*  1) *YOU* have *SINNED* (Romans 3:23). 2) The wages of *YOUR* sin is separation from God and death, in the *ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL* (Romans 6:23) 3) To avoid this fate and go to heaven, *YOU* must be *PERFECT* because God is *PERFECT* (Revelation 21:27) 4) *YOU* will never be perfect because *YOU* have sinned, so *YOU* need a *SAVIOUR* since *YOU* cannot earn heaven by *YOUR* works (Ephesians 2:8-9) 5) Jesus Christ *IS* God; who came in the flesh, lived a *PERFECT* life and died as a *SUBSTITUTE* for *YOU,* so *YOU* don't have to pay the penalty for *YOUR* sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). 6) All God demands is that *YOU BELIEVE* in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; that *HIS BLOOD* washes away *ALL* of *YOUR* sins and makes *YOU PERFECT* (John 3:16, John 6:47, Romans 10:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4). 7) Now *YOU* cannot go to hell because *YOU* have *NO* sins to pay for. Jesus *PAID* for *ALL* of *YOUR* sins. *YOU* have received the *FREE GIFT* of *ETERNAL LIFE* (1 John 5:13).
I came here 2 days ago to hear this. Then I went to no life shaq page and listened again. Now I'm back to listen again and to tell you that shaq sent me. We here for da barzzzzzz coach! 💙NLG

This song is absolutely Genius!! I see why it was trending, but I have also noticed that there was extreme growth when first put up out but has decreased in views in the last 24hours. In my opinion it should have already reached 1mil! Congratulations to DAX! Keep spreading the msg!!
He is garbage

Bro speaking nothing but the truth and you can guess why he got some haters LOL people always want to hate the truth and never embrace it  Been fire before he even dropped his first single.  We believe in you bro. Keep going.
Dax am waiting on your next album  We are the label Itz dax  Back at it like bad habit
I love this Song so much 🖤
Wow...Dax they’ll never see you coming im telling you we gotta protect you 💯💯👍🏾🔥👁
And I don’t want to be famous but if I was I would never stop talking and praising Jesus and help/ talk to as many people that look up to me to let them know they are just like me and vise versa if they try hard enough! Just like you Dax you are a real rapper I would defend in person and you’re legacy of teaching morals the RIGHT WAY WITH MUSIC!!❤️❤️🙏🏽
He’s just venting fast and to a beat???? Not really a song.....
{<><>}
This guy said he’d have an Oscar last year yet still can’t top ksi’s music he’s getting bare features and views and ksi is insane dad has good lyrics but meh he’s just ass compared to jj
🔥 thank you for this man! Love you hope you doing well!!
This song is 🔥🔥🔥
It's Dax🔥🔥🔥
Says”they don’t care unless you have a check” then doesn’t respond to any of the people that don’t have checks🤣
DAX ALWAYS BRING THE FIRE 🔥
Who the f##k DAX
Yes sir yes sir. Spit them real facts. 🔥💯💯
DAMN!! This slaps!! Amazing!!
This is fire
Saw this 1st on Shaq, had to come show support.
its been two days and i cant tell you how many times i´ve  watched this already this really hits home especially the "Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel When you take that time away from your phone"  part. also its got gotham which im basically obsessed with as a theme so its just a masterpiece in my mind.
This is going to blow, and I am just predicting it.
Dang
Keep up the fire my bro! 🔥
Bat dax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h03Kae5gXYc is true ?
This has a really good message. Keep up good work.
Following, supporting and watching you all the way from Ghana, in Africa ☝🏾 You're a very big motivation to me, keep doing what you do best, cos you the best ❤️
Im going to ask the question that we all want to ask can be ever escape "Gotham"
"If you ain't got a blue check you ain't anybody" Dax for life🙏🙌💥🔥
“Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel, when you take that time away from your phone”
Batman and Bruce wayne watching this: 👁👄👁
this is the best by far well done dax ❤❤
This guy raps the truth I love this guy the best rapper in my opinion
I NEED this on a vinyl.
Consistent  Always consistent
This is the person I aspire to be a person who crushes peoples dreams to the right amount till people know about how unclean and dirty they are and how foolish they are to be blinded by positivity all to follow reality and humble themselves to a perfect form of wisdom and truth that is why I love this guys music
Make more tracks like Homicide if you want to be famous ass real nigga
These lyrics are so complex, such a good song 🔥
Who was with dax before he had 1mill subscribers ?   Smashing it as always!  He is BACK 🔥
RIGHT  NOBODY WILL SAVE YOU SAVE YOURSELF
I really can't believe what I'm hearing. This is a masterpiece and you've certainly outdone yourself. I do hope this song ends up in the new Batman film.
When someone tells fax. The world will try to drown it out with bs.
Tune
He keeps on getting better
Ksi
Meaningful bars. Thank you for the great reminders on most of your bars that you've composed to get me right back on track in life🔥
Hello fam. I loved the music a lot! The bar at 1:31 is my fav. You have to totally team up with the lit rapper X Li. His music sorta is similar to 24kGoldn mixed with a bit of Rich Brian! He is a cool rapper in Canada!  You should totally check out his channel out and give him a subscribe! 👉 #XLiNewArtist
I may be young once I get older I'll remember what dax said.
I came for the Batman reference
lil pump sings dumb gucci stuffs and gets even more famous
I quit social media two months ago, best decision of my life.
I wanna be famous so I can make money right now at the rate I'm going to be homeless and if I'm famous I can make money
Best song in 2020 ✌

It's real.  You say NO to the deal with the devil they blacklist you.  Watch my video called Jesus dream - where (after I talk about the dream) I also talk of my REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE meeting a man/devil spirit trying to get me to sell my soul to satan.  I REBUKE YOU SATAN!  FORGIVE - REPENT - PRAY.  OneSinnerSaved.com
We need more rappers like him man. The game is broken
Keep the hustle strong dax ✊🏿
It's getting old looking at to many   bloody face videos.
This is dax in his bag
Dax shady u the 🐐
This is inspiring
If i was ever famous id just use laws for my liking legally you cannot take pictures of people with out there consent and famous people do not count as public service workers such as police and if they took pictures of me at my private residence thats even more laws broken so....
1:35 DAMN sound insane  Thats why i like the music of Dax
Just amazing song beat message.. Just everything 😱❤️❤️

🔥
The lyrics on this song are one of the best i've ever heard! Keep the good work
this song is straight facts
Polska zgłaszać się 🤙
This. Is. Amazing. And so real. This world has become twisted, people losing themselves only to become hollow shells obsessed with the public eye, the label, the name; we have lost our connection as a society, as a people as a whole. I hope one day we can get it all back, but we are far down the rabbit hole now. As we are now, we are only falling farther and deeper down.
Not from New York but I get the message
Thanks for great content.
Im real picking with the rap i listen to but this song is top notch 👌 going on the playlist for sure!
You have such a gifted mind. Scary if more people knew about you. Being too real in this day and age gets you lost in the mist. I pray your skills get the props they deserve.
I love the way your videos go And it matches with the Halloween 🎃Holiday  The lyrics as usual A1🔥🔥🔥
This song is fire
Dax is becoming one of the best rappers out there
DAX IS BACK
💯
Dex just know the Industry knows your a woke rapper...they not gonna fuck w you  that’s how the dark side of the industry work sad world

“If your fragile don’t even try to come to this place”- Dax    That is the one,everyone in this world has to always have hate towards each other and if u can’t deal with it just don’t come🤷🏽‍♀️.
Sick song and badass video
You are great!
You inspire me with everything you do, I hope you’re feeling better man
I can see myself listing to it after 20 years
I thought the bald guy was Pitbull at first 😂
I'm a fan of ksi as a YouTuber, but let's be honest, Dax is leagues above him in rapping
Dex is woke👀 I didn’t know
Perfectly describes LA...
GOTHAN stand for hollywood
Road to a million
Gotham is EVERYPLACE!!! It’s not LA NY LONDON PARIS TOKYO     and the blue check is lately how people check for importance?!!!   That’s whack.  Cuz SuperHero.   Is the ones that say and/or do no matter it’s popularity!!
Chills 💯🥶
Such a good song!
"That's what happens when the master starts fearing the student"  🔥🔥⚡🇷🇺
This song represents Hollywood deep song what matters to be happy y'all first and other stuff comes next
Brilliant🦇
Y’all got to get out of Gotham

“Dumb people got smartphones” you could of ended the song right there
Fireeeeeee
I dont really care about fame, money or status.If I did have any of those I would use it to help others in need. Not only charities but just overall everybody I could.
I really like the song the meaning behind gotham is represented really well. Thats another like.
Hmmm is this him warning about illuminati and trying not to do what they ask?
No one talked to me until I started driving a fancy car to school
Did anyone else smoke b4 this and thought his white beater was a big ass tattoo on the scene where they dragging him😂🤔
I hated this honestly it’s emo rap and for cry baby’s.
Deep

Dax: speaks Me: (flames)
The best...
who ever got power he is slowley killing the weak
Ayyo!! Let's get this to 200k likes by Tuesday, for a fact I know I'm not the only one who wants to hear the other 4 minutes of joker!!
https://youtu.be/7E1cBk-m3fY
This on my personal billboard top 10 rn
It’s really a difficult position to go through if you want to be famous but I don’t know why people care about famous people more than normal that’s why don’t give people attention if you famous just smile and complete your way that’s success and if God wants you to be successful just know that he made your life to a test, will you help people? Will you not show off? Will you give people advice.
Lit🔥
Best so far
Happiness is not a physical place you call home ... I felt that.
Dax look up gocc
Thank you once again amazing bro. can't wait to hear the four more minutes of  joker even if that the 200,000t don't happen by the way it would  be f****** great if you did another dear santa. top ten song ever in my book. #santa's a bitch
Love this man! Love from 🇮🇳
Dude you’re Sick Af  Haters I’m a fan so  Daddy Chill 😂.
I dont know if I should say Lit or jokes. Dax you need to drop another Tory Lanez diss. Find someone who looks like him and do a video, you're going up 💯💯💥
I've always been kinda mehhh on Dax, but holy shit this song is one of the best of 2020
Damnnn man you're FABULOUS
🙋🙋🙋🙋☝🙆👊
Yo I’m cleaning my bathroom and I wasn’t even watching and I know you’re talking about weird ass Hollywood.   I have never heard of you but I discovered you cause my younger brother is a high key fan. I love it. I love that this is what’s going through his head. Also, explains why he keeps lecturing me about LA  ♥️♥️❤️🖤💪🏽❤️♥️

Beautiful
If you a real OG OF DAX LIKE👇
Lyrically fire,this is absolutely BRILLIANT About to play this to my son's Keep up the great work,and thankyou so much for making this track of truth
The message behind this is so true. Social media is a ruler now. Dax is very talented and you can hear the pain in his voice. This song is 🔥
Dax is the new age Pac, nothing but truth in his music! So much talent.
Exactly how i think. Drives me nuts
Don’t ignore the fuckin facts ! DAX is woke n it’s obvious
Another banger🔥
As allways ... 🖤
Dumb people got smart phones 🔥
He said, "in the city full angels with the most influence, i see demons who just effin abuse it." LA
Dax you do this for me 🔥🎧
LMAO 10 MILLION VIEWS??? lets see how long that takes dummy well be here for a while
I can relate I'm stuck in gotham trying to raise my life but ain't n one gonna save me tho
🙌🏽💯🙌🏽
....... lol when dax cant pop now he doesnt wanna pop boo hoo. Remeber when you said 3 years in a row the next year youd pop? And then you didnt. Feels bad.
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the blood of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning, it's about having faith that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and you're given eternal life. The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation, all you have to do is have faith in Christ. https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI (He also has a Spanish version.).
i wonder if Dax’s ready for the new Batman movie wit Robert Pattinson.
That was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn bro. Telling stories in rap like it’s the 90s.
This is Prince Ea's brother
Kinda deep that he saves himself.
Its really nice to see all these likes. Shows so much about how much he cares about his fans.
real
Love from🇰🇪💗
Yessirrr🔥🐐
I always fuck with Dax one of the dopest ever but I'm growing tired of the beat up looking Dax and these messages about how shit is when we already know. We know. The question is what you gonna do about it? It's just continous complaining at this point. I know Dax got more to him than that.
🔥🔥🔥
Hes the joker and batman
I swear everything you said in this rap is real and it hit me like a tractor trailer!
DOPE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ughhh I need you to do a music video with green arrow in it. But the netflix version. Because hot take but that one was better then the comics
“in a city full of angels with the biggest influence i see demons with the platform who just fucking abuse it” wow that was pure flames or plasma with all states and phases 🔥 you’re a lyrical genius bro
Spitting straight facts tho 🤷🏼‍♀️💯💥
Phenomenal 🔥
If it aint real it aint rapping, and what he speeks is real, respect homie
This Is fire !!!
Hey Dax I hope everything has been good for you since my last comment. If you see this again I wanted to tell you that I hope everyday your mind spirit and body grows and that you keep creating your art and vision and any message youre trying to get across i hope it makes it. I hope your family has been good and healthy and y'all arent struggling in this fucked up time. You take it easy bro keep slaying beats

The truth is too much for some people... their afraid of it... I guess the world prefers fake people to be famous... that's just sad... this damn world is just sad.  But I got my friends and family and whoever reads this know that the ones close to you mean more than all the money in the world... they mean more than all those fake ass celebrities... at least some celebrities are aware of this and aren't blind, respect to Dax 🔥🔥

I can't stop listening to your songs. Your lyrics are just so true and real. ♥️🔥
Crazy dope!!
This is fire🔥
You are the best Dax please make more songs you are a god rapper just like Eminem!!!!!!!you are my favorite rapper you are #1.
All the dislikes are fake woke
Wow this deep 🦾💪
The thumbnail looked like a videogame
Just facts 😭😭🔥🔥
This Man is Underrated
As always straight 🔥🔥
This is the perfect song for every going on dax you've been one of my top 1 I love you keep up your Amazing work you've helped heal my heart
I dont wanna be famous just want money to give away
Love all you music n keep up yo grind man cuz in so many of your fans minds your a goat n I'm one of them who think that
His fans who do u want to be for Halloween    Dax Batman 😂
💩
Thank God 🙏  we got you Dax! Speak the truth men ty! I really needed this!
I enjoyed it. But the chorus was (to me) boring. The message was good but the scenery was campy to the point of just being silly which I think may have taken away from the message. It reminds me of that twitter song by that french singer only...i think his was able to communicate the horror better. Edit Carmen by stromae was the song I was thinking of. Edit: sorry not French, Belgian.
Dax still staying true to himself. Don't edit your soul for the culture.
Fire masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥  Love from Algeria 🙏🇩🇿🇩🇿
Nice song I think I got a new favorite
Like!!!
Worth the wait definitely, damn. Dax never disappoints. The message? 👏🏻🔥
Dax and Joyner should and definitely should get a grammy! They deserve it!!
Sign this man to StrangeMusic!
DAX IS BAAAAACK WITH A BURNING FIRE TRACK NO SHIRT GANG!
Yo dax I love ur music, and it’s way more impactful than u know, ur music has saved my life. Joker literally saved me from killing myself. I really want part 2
Amazing 🔥
The fire at the end was mad corny. The rest of the video was 🔥
B
i realized something guys, u wont believe it..........      Dax is wearing a shirt!!!!
Trust me...Dax be getting a role soon in the DC
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow, a rapper and musician who doesn’t use his platform to rap about hate, violence, s*x, drugs and money, but real things that are going on in the world. Of course dax doesn’t need to curse because he says everything the way it is. Hate to say it but I feel like this isn’t getting the attention it needs because people obsess themselves with fake stupid rap music that convey no message whatsoever. “People build you up just to break you”-dax. We need more people like you in the world telling us the truth. Sending my love and prayers ❤️
Welcome Back Dax 🔥🔥🔥
And this man is not an xxl freshman?!? SMH one of the best out rn💯
я один русский?
Love it Dax! So creative and real! Your lyrics and delivery is always top notch! Fucking killing it! #WeAreTheLabel
Dax is a DC fan, it's official.
Who are you.. glad I saw this. This is dope
This is too good🔥🔥🔥
This should be the new batman soundtrack
🔥 my guy you stay speaking facts always going to be one of my top 5 favorite rappers
KSI got nothing on you, and that’s coming from a KSI fan
This song is so dope. Your music better than most out there. u deserve the credit
Do all these wrappers have these idiotic hair styles
I thought this was gonna be a remix to Tokyo’s revenges song😔
straight bars.
its DAX...me everytime you drop a vid
Fact words
Facts!!! Be a lion NOT A SHEEP!  Time to wake up not stay asleep!
I was gone for a minute but I’m back now
Fakes real and they say real’s fake woke. Dax speaks Fax, always has always will 🙏
Dax, I usually don't like your chorus or hooks that much. (I typically don't like them that much in any song) but wow this is actually good every verse and hook 💯
The Public sucks f**k hope. RIP to ME death by America. In me I trust * only I can judge me FTW
I wish this got a lot more views, it really deserves it, should have been over a million in the first day
so inspirational🥀
its insane that u dont get that many views, most underrated artist!!
Everyone wants something. What do you really want from life?...
Its dax again 💥🥂
That hook came in and I got chills...woah
this is AMAZING!! we need more artists like you
You don’t know how much I feel for this, I was raised for a world that dosnt exist anymore I have my morals and I’m full of respect for everyone but all I get back is the ass end of what everyone tosses to the curb it’s horrifying that we have come this far and you are the answer if only people would listen
Amazing song by u dax❤️

Spittin' FAX! 🔥
Hi Dax, welcome back!

Dude this is facts for life now in today's world. Most people don't expect or respect the person who tries to change the world or work to be better than where they began. Thanks for the fire song 🔥
Gun shot fire
Woke rapper? Damn chosen ones unite. (Chosen ones are people who woke up, anyone can be chosen)
Nice
I really love how he always talks about how much fame obsession and social media has changed people. Very talented overall.
TERU
I want love to conquer all the planet. For love to be the only ruler, drawing lines of love through us. Fantastic song and visuals to encapsulate the sort of role model these kids should have. I dropped this album same day as this, which was my bday two days ago https://open.spotify.com/album/41STyMZdRCoHlPRPOmMufJ no i most definite don't want to be famous, terrorised or adored by zombies. it would be cool to look eye to eye with everyone with divine love through all are eyes. but that comes later. matey, if you want to go down legendary in universe, you have to go down as the most hated and notorious , then your loved across the universe. its all one love, don't get it twisted, but these souls are so controlled and conditioned, you especially have to go anti hero to help. although beings of light, we are at the final days of the age of darkness. lucky for them, the silent heros have won the spirtual war, and its game over. they know they are screwed and can't escape. even if they had the technology to escape the planet, they can't because the whole universe won't let it happen. they could shut off all their electronics with one button. thats not they're style. beings of love, guided by love, they waited for us to get back to the same level of consciousness as our previous golden age of enlightnment, skills out of your wildest dreams, the ability to build and make structures, medicines than cannot be understood or replicated in this last 50 year run up to the lifting of the veil. one love brother
Didnt have to destroy all rappers bro🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This video hit me hard..
If this aint fire then idk what is? Dax always talking about real shit. More people need to listen to this man. Homie is woke.
HEAT🔥
Most will just bob their heads to the beat. I bob my head because I can see.
"In a city full of angels with the biggest influence I see demons with a platform who just fucking abuse it" Damn..... Fire.
you are a king bro
This man always on point
I came from a Snapchat story and I’m glad I did

Your words speak value, they speak life and they always speak the truth of the fickle culture of celebrity worship. You speak these truths that society has over time turned a deaf ear to, I just hope more people can free themselves from these lies.

I commented on one of your videos about how The Dark Knight has a lot what's going on did a video cool
Thank you for existing, Dax, you helped me make my first song, and now i can't see an end to all this writing and music. You are a constant inspiration and constant proof of what one man can do if he puts his mind to it. I have zero financial gain from my music but i keep writing because it keeps me sane, and thank you for showing me that i was missing this my whole life.
Fire
This man is such a talented lyricist, his storytelling skills are incredible🔥🔥 He's versatile with rap and the vocals, the hate he gets just because ksi says something, his fans agree for no reason I like KSI but this man is on another level he's much better rapper and lyricist. Y'all know that's the truth,  Glad your back dax 👍
A rap song of pure truth. Rare nowdays
imagine getting a heart from dax
Did you know this guy used to be a janitor
This guy is fuckin woke.
I still feel like this guy is still underrated...but i don care anymo ..his intellectual style of rapping is an art that should be appreciated and he aint corny or whatever he just doin his thang...
I'm an upcoming rapper so eventually I will become famous but I don't want to become famous to that extent that I end up losing my soul🤧
The word play is too on point🔥 another banger💯

Good job ❤️❤️👌👌👍
That verse @ 2:30 He went crazy
Dudes hair is gross looking.
This song way deeper than I expected and it sounds amazing stay on your grind
Ayo brother inspiring fax
man I really want to like Dax cuz, that first shit he did to Em with his phone number was ballsy af but, he trying so hard to be clever like, you can tell in all his joint's he feels like he is saying something profound and, deep but, it's just not that.. Also, he just not a great lyricist yet, want's so bad to play the industry is just blackballing me cuz, i'm different card but, they are not lying to you you just not there yet my dude worry less about production value and, spend more time practicing.. I mean I am no lyricist but, I am an artist and, the same rules apply.. or everyone just haters yo and, I am actually the asshole for being honest..
Yo he said he'll drop other half of joker! Like this!
This isn't a song this is a story
Reminds me of Hopsin!
The G.O.A.T
fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This and Dear God are the best songs you have made. Keep it up!!
This song has soul man, has a more of a old school flow instead of that mumble crap, not bad, pretty good.
Thank u so much Dax. I really hope u are good now. We love u so much and we will always stand behind u. WE ARW THE LABEL
We need to protect this man
this feels so real man, lyrics from the heart  🔥🔥🔥
Shits so corny. I like the lyrics but I feel like he’s too corny to ever really make it bigger. Hope I’m wrong tho
this is fire keep it up king
lend me your lyrics bag please
https://youtu.be/BdS7B30nKFE indian verion of this song
Why so serious??
WELCOME BACK DAX!!!!!!!
insane bruhhhhhh nice lyrics !!!!!!!!!
ITZ DAX CONSCIOUS RAPPER he broke the mould for sure OF this dumbed out generation ❄️ 💯
"How badly do you wanna be famous?" ...😶👀  That's a real question 🤞
Cool guys don‘t look at explosions..
TRUE
😏
This song is dope, 🙌🙌.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Here is my reaction: https://youtu.be/nZ6aigiVvBs
I usually skim thru music not really paying attention to what is truly being said..but this man makes me sit up and actually listen to the lyrics the change of flow the vibe..its just really good..truly underrated artist
🔥🔥🔥🔥
True genius
Yeah boi always with the wise lyrics
Imagine disliking😒
Fame isn't important to me. I'd rather be wealthy and lowkey.
How someone can dislike😑 Love from Afghanistan
I Am myself a ksi fan .. but Dax been fire lately and this one is pure 🔥
Where's that song with #SnowThaProduct
I appreciate it the hustle but when are you fighting ksi?
Happiness is not a physical place you call home .... Dope line 😎 #It's Dax
some1 sign this guy i wanna experience his full potential
every single song you make hits so hard. there’s not 1 song from you that i listen to where i said “this songs okay”, no every single song is just so god damn good from you. you speak the truth, you speak shit people need to hear, you speak about shit that’s happening throughout the world. you are amazing. keep doing you man, been here since dear god and every song you make always ends up on repeat for me. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
@ darlene ward according to the article it says they use a skin lightening/bleaching lotion that made them look like  from completely black to light skinned mixed race although they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/1-best-seller-extra-strength-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml evidently this is also the same lotion that black hollyood celebrities use to lighten their skin.Why dont they just admit it? unless they want people to think they are naturally light skinned.Apparently this lotion is strong enough that it changes your color from dark to light.
People that are disliking are haters. Dax is lyrical better than 99% of the other rappers. Dax songs are deep fr
You are my crush😢I so relate to your music .I love you
Why the hell is this not #1 on trending. Pathetic that the truth doesn’t come first. They all afraid of it Dax. Keep up the amazing work. I follow you brother and it all starts with one. You all better be posting this every where and better be spreading his message. Absolutely amazing✊🏽
Nobodys from here, but everyone comes here!!!!!!!!!!!
I enjoyed reacting to this. I love the symbolism in the video. I love the substance-heavy content, rhyme schemes, singing, delivery, emotion,  wordplay, and all. This music video is a movie fasho. Big ups. I hope you're feeling well today.
Am so glad dax is back finally I can listen to some meaningful music!! 💯🎯
This is so amazing, keep it up Dax!
woooooooooow
Your big fans from Singapore 😅😅
DAX, one of the realest artists out there !!!
I think this is slightly a message for ksi. He says fuck your co-signs because ksi did a cosign featuring dax and he was totally biased against him. And then he goes on to say they won't give you credit because the know you use it I think that means Ksi won't give him the credit he deserves. Comment what you think thatverse means
Joker > batman
Love from India ❤️ sir
Incredible, love u Dax💜
Insane Dax. Probably my favourite
Why does the chorus sound like its gonna be played in a cinematic scence of the batman games? Love it though, keep that 🔥🔥 coming man
Yo dude, that is a masterclass in cohesive lyric writing ..... not a wasted line. Bravo!
DAX, I love it brother!
You got me with this one.  Stay strong.
Daaamn it You're amazing bruuh i'm really like it  🇲🇦🇲🇦
Absolute fire as usual hair stands up when I hear you spit
🔥
better than that really love shit
Frankfurt izz da 069 🇹🇷
The fight animations is fckin awesome dude..and the song....hooooo its fire!
Dax with the fax
Song spills facts
He's one of the most realest artist out here and its sad to see that shitty artists like trippie red and 6ix9ine has all the popularity which dax should have dax will be the G.O.A.T in the next 10 years bcz other artists rides trend and when those trend overs there careers overs too but Dax has Lyrisicm which will stay forever.
Ngl this is actually dope the rest of your music is stale but rate this it has such a hidden meaning some people won't see but the way this is presented is grate keep up with music like this and you'll go far
I want a Remix with Dax and Tokyo's Revenge Gotham!!!✨🔥
Mannn i need subtitles xD
Legend only 💔🙏🐐🐐
It's Dax
Dax is a genius. I believed in him since Dear God. I can write songs, rhymes and poems but never been in a studio. Want to be famous one day.
Your so simply stupendous you dax should be the new batman👌
hes talking about trippie red  chris brown future all those lost sole rappers  swallowed by fame and money lose their sole
Yet hes doing all this for money and fame.
They waiting for him to slip or come up with something he really ain't try on fr something that he was just playing with, that they might be able to outdo themselves..then that when most the negative bs gonna come.
I think there has to be a higher grade then A+. I don't have a grade to give this song. It's better than perfect.
Dax’s songs always have amazing music videos and messages it’s insane & surprisingly it is actually good music (btw no hate)  Good shit Dax 🔥
Aye as always, I'm never ceased to be amazed honestly..just the energy this dude puts into his videos is Better than most of anything out. Let alone the facts and his way with word play he brings to the table, makes him almost untouchable rn fr..that's why nobody really trying to do shit wit him much, they know they can't kill shit as good as he does..
i will use your songs to teach my brothers to speak english.
Anyone else hoping we get the 200k for the second half of the Joker song???
Feeling this one bro 👍
Another banger🤫🤫🔥🔥
This is hard bro. I don't think his talking about Gotham 🤣
stay humble like you are chik chik boom fire.
every word hits like an earthquake. 👁
This is a serious bit of work. Good stuff.
love from india every line is dope true af
Glad to see you back Dax, hope you feeling yourself again. Seems that way putting out a banger like dis.

Real Life Interpretation; When You Save Yourself They Plot In Circumstances For Someone And Something Else To Take The Victory.  There Is No Rehearsal On The Front Line, War Is Mandatory For Victory. Thanks That #ThatsDax .

Istg it’s so so effing true😔
Same amount of subs and comments of a 12 Year girl opening boxed toys and you think your famous ? lol
Dax be to smart. glad ur back with a banger.. the best thing about our guy here is he knows whats he raps about his raps means shit and there are real lessons and stories in there if u care to really listen. Instead of these chart topping mumbling fools just rapping about Hennessy, Xanax and smacking bitches oh and views/likes... looking forward to what ever else you have coming soon 👊
Strong Message bro! Couldn't agree with you more!
G.O.A.T IN MAKING
Dax is back for the TOP WHERE HE BELONGS 👍👍🔥🔥🔥

Love the song but the music video ain’t that great tbh, fighting scenes could’ve been a little bit better but you ain’t an actor so it’s ight. Still love the song.

🎶🔥💯🔥🎶
What makes Dax a YouTube rapper? He does not make any youtube videos. He posts on spotify. He just makes music videos for YouTube like everyone else. Anyway I'm trying to get 100 subs before christmas. I make bodyweight exercise videos for teens.
Bro you are the new lyrical king. When Em finally steps away it's not gonna be K Dot or Hopsin that take the top spot it's you my guy
Wow adama traore can rap
Such a good song🔥💪
Wow;  he’s rapping facts!
One more thing. I'm not famous but...I don't wanna be because of it's drawbacks. It's not worth it unless my fans really do enjoy my music and aren't fake fans.
Ay love the music but... I understand it keeps his image or whatever but dax would look so much better without those STUPID EXCUSE FOR DREADLOCKS ON HIS HEAD. PLEASE DAX CUT IT OFF IT LOOKS RETARDED!!!
Ayo king keep making these 🔥 song.. DAX!
I love how my boy dax dresses up as Batman🔥🔥
Fire🔥🔥🔥
"Fake's real and they say real's fake woke" - Dax 2020  Respect is real. You're either both or neither. This next generation of Hip-Hop's in your hands now. Save it.

When he stuck that verification tick on his forehead I actually felt that

Hey Dax , Keep saving  Rap , you have started in my opinion  to turn it into something that takes rap to a form of poetry i do not listen to rap but i admire the words and motivation you speak you keep me alive cant speak for others but thank you so much

Damn😍
At the base of Dax's hair...is it solid hair?
You are my New fav 🖤🖤🖤🖤 You should come to Dubai , collaboration 🖤
If this doesn’t make the new Batman soundtrack I’ll be disappointed
3:10 he killed Mr. Worldwide himself
🔥🔥🔥
I felt attacked when Dax said Dump people getting Smart phones
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn! He really looks good with a SUIT on
DAX...      Thanks!
This guy is an Eminem lvl rapper ❤️
https://youtu.be/HR9D8_SVnsM
I fucking love Dax for incorporating Batman related stuff into the message he's sending. This & Joker are both fucking great 🔥🔥
the answer is dax.
trash and corny
It's Dax⚡⚡⚡
Damn man this song is hella nice. I got this on repeat
Why I want to be famous is because I want to prove my teachers and parents wrong, I don't want to work like a zombie and getting not a lot of money, I want to enjoy and having the wealth
Daaaaaxxx 🔥🔒
Truth spoken ❤️ it's DAX 💖
Criminals after batman beats tf out of them:
if yu stop swearing in your songs...more people will like your songs🎶
Dax your doing so much right now  and have been for a while every other song is better than last and your lyrics are so well thought of keep the music up your doing amazing can't wait for more songs
It's much better when it's like it's fast
You are Genius
My fav poet . Real Music 🤟
Lol mans spitting facts about today’s life/world.....it’s amazing half the people still won’t get what he sayon
dax op!💯
Ow just loved your music new lyrics such a great 👐🖤 message tysm DAX 💕 love from India (DARJEELING)
Im raper DAX comment my track Pls! You is The Best 👑👑👑👑
Bruh, Thank you for spitting real lyrics and keeping it all a buck...best sub I ever made!!
DAX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everytime I listen to your songs , I sit down and think about life.  We don't get such Artists anymore.
DAX!!!!
I heard an em flow.
I’m 44 and been listening to hip hop since nwa and think Dax is one of the best to do it! This is fucking sick🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dude i been watin for my favorite rapper to come back
Blind people driving....... 🏃
0https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rk
Lyrics are the most important !!!
Nobody is from here but everyone comes here. What the hell are you talking about??
Missed ma boy Dax thanks for the song🙏🙏
Too fire Dax. Too fire.
Yung Batman I post up in Gotham
what the hell did dax just put a decent hook on a track?
Flow cold message real 🤟🏼🤝
Lyrically slaughters every track he puts out. The versatility is insane from every song
Wow this was just .....🔥🔥
He's back 💜
for all the comments about dax not being mainstream. lots of artists are "discovered" years after they pour their heart and soul into their art. not popular now but when the words hit home people will listen.
You listen to these people who got nothing to say.
Fractured
Eminem got superman, Dax got the whole Gotham city
This is a Banger, dude you deserve so much more than this
You always come up with something unique!!! 🔥Love from this side man!!! ❤
u have improved man
I get what Dax is saying, Gotham isn't just a fictional location, but it's a mind state. Everyone goes to Gotham because they want to be famous, but all that fame affects peoples minds, because of that, media gets corrupt, spreading fake news, wanting to be famous. I never expected that the song would have references of the fictional place, by the way, I love that Jason Rodd reference.
I wanna be famous but... I wanna be the underdog i wanna have to fight my way to the top and let them know I'm something either if that means i wanna do streaming/gaming/making music in 2026 my name will be known
This is fire👌🔥🔥🔥
Holy shit man you
Joker last time Gotham this time I see a theme, hopefully we can see the other 4 mins of joker aswell keep it up my guy ❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Nice Music my G
My boy Dax back with the Facts! 🔥🔥🔥
Always speaking facts 💯💯💯
dax is low key giving me spirituality aware vibes and I hella fw it, people gotta realize where the industry is taking them and what its doing to them
He literally just explained society today in one song👩🏾‍🦯
Its dax the janitor who can clap KSI
fake shit goes viral we know this won’t 🔥
If this guy doesn’t get recognised for what a gem he is, it’ll be a shame
He got me on, 'when dump people get smart phones!!'
Damn, DAX!
Good stuff man
[Verse 1] I think that we’re headed down the wrong road (I swear) Fake's real and they say real’s fake woke (You see this?)

Welcome Back My G, missed you so much🖤
I don’t know why but it’s like he used to only talk about how he was a janitor if you ever did get famous it would kind of be funny if he got famous for being a janitor at some point
My first comment, and makes sense why 🤞. Your perspective of the system really improves our thinking bro, 🙌

I wish Dax and Teezo touchdown were more noticed. It’ll be nice to see a change in people perspective on rap and music in general. Change isn’t always bad

This was an interesting and incredible new attack. This should be playing in the radio and news and ads for exposure. DAX KILLED IT AND CARE ABOUT IT. looking forward to more. Thank you so much
Dax, love you man. No hate. But your thumbnails could be movie posters if it wasn’t for that wack ass thing on your head. What’s happening up there. 💈?
Bro I love your music it is literally the realest shi* I've ever heard

*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
2:07 joker clap lmao
Opinion/ Best Bar: “In Gotham everybody knows everybody, if u don’t got a blue check you ain’t anybody” 🔥🔥
I swear, whenever I watch one of your videos it's like you're opening a section of your mind and letting us view it. It's different and real, I appreciate the effort you do take to do all this. ❤😊
Every since I played one song of yours my dads been addicted and always asks if you've released a new song, can't wait to show him this one
Let's go bro
@Dax have you seen the Social Dilemma doc?
Woah.. that's lit man 🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🖤⭐⚡💫✊🏼

Respect bro this is nice this is added to my Playlist
*Tokyo’s Revenge anyone? Lmao*
Gotta respect he didn’t say he was a janitor in this song
Honestly I respect your work 🔥🔥🔥💫
Why do all these deep meaning songs have to have singing?
The rapping is kinda confusing but the singing is really good
I listen to Joker on loop.  ♡ Now this song
a world of uncertain well you  can't decide your own destination. ^^ GOTHAM 🔥
Another banger from Dax--- someone please put this man on. Bars are on a different level. Such an epic message on every single track. The rap game needs the depth of messages that Dax is spilling on these tracks. <3
Dude, this is actually soooo good. Such pure lyrics ❤️
B.E.A.U.TIFUL
South Africa loves you bro❤
1:50 i thought he said living in gato
If you are listening to Dax, you will realize that those rappers who promote sex, drugs, and violence are garbage.
You're putting your all into these songs and the masses aren't focusing on you. I bet if you were singing bullshxt they would follow you up. They programmed to follow lies and ignore the truth. It's the new world order
He didn’t mention him as a janitor
Bars are so unbelievable and he just gave away so much free game 💰💯🔥
We want the whole albums!!!❤️❤️❤️
every once in a while Dax comes with these bangers and make you fall in love with his music. great video too.
No YouTube rap can fuck with dax react if U ain't no hater his waving 🔥💣  He always come with something new big up gee 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙆
❤
A powerful message that more than half this country needs to listen to.
Dwight Howard can rap??? Jk      This is fire dax🌋
Didn't know i needed a entire Dax Batman album but with this and Joker, I absolutely do, I want a Scarecrow song now, keep up the amazing work
Wow.dax you got poetry talent...
Wow.dax you got poetry talent...
Ohh 🔥🔥omg soo rocking 🔥 best rapper
Actually a very good song
R.E.A.L.
you should team up with Prince EA because you got the right voice for his style of vids
Let me regrade that, I would love to be famous, but for a good reason. I ain’t trying to have no fake friends or fall in love with any gold diggers. Dax, I feel bad that you had to go through this stuff. I hope you keep making music like this. #Gotham
Dax you should try to get the producers of the new upcoming Batman movie to use your song.
U are my inspiration dax
🖤🖤🖤  This tho

This is so underrated.
Dax = pure talent! Lyrics in a song have always been my focus and you always deliver. This is another masterpiece, I should be used to by now but I dont know why I am always amazed. Can't wait to see what you have in reserve for us.
Dax deserves some love for constantly coming with meaningful and barful tracks. Shiw this man some love. Ill go first...This for you Dax 🌹
That’s hit though I like it
You are ridiculously talented!
3:16 the stunt double got no tats lmao
This was amazing 🔥

Respect the feeling
This is dope. But I can't help but hear him influenced by Hopsin SO MUCH. Hopsins sauce all over.
It is absolutely crazy how real all your songs are yet people rather listen to the same songs by different "artist" just talking bout clout, drugs, and flashing rented cars women and stupid shit
don't give me heart ...
Bad boy ur great star
My guess is the Dems are in partnership with China to release the Wuhan virus.. just so they can win 2020 election.  What business was Biden actually doing in China? Virus business? google Obama in Wuhan
“Dumb people with smartphones”   Wow...so deep!!!
This is one of my favorite songs you released this year, Dax! Actually so fire. And I know you're going to make a trilogy of Batman-based songs!  🔥🔥🔥
I honestly think this song is true rebel talk. I love how he describes the horrible way of our lives because of media and the government. I think it's really punk and awesome. Thank you Dax for making real music for people who feel alone because they see the real world the real way. It sucks and it's honestly refreshing to have real people like Dax to talk to us like a real person and teach us like a shifu. To wake us up and let us know we're not crazy or alone and this is real. My hope resides in our generation that we can actually make this earth worth while. I dream about days like those and with this music and music like this lets me know we're on a good path, also it gives me strength to keep going to maybe even be a person who can try to make a difference because I feel all us humans are worth it & Dax really helps us/you/me feel worth it. Much love 💜
Dear friend, though we often change, Jesus never does for He is ALWAYS compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in love and faithfulness. I can really appreciate Moses’s request of God to “show me your glory” (Exodus 33 : 18). Having been chosen to lead a large group of people who often grumbled against him, Moses wanted to know that God would indeed help him with this great task. Moses’s request was rewarded by a demonstration of God’s glory. God announced to Moses His name and characteristics.   He is “the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness” (34 : 6).                                                This verse reminded me that our Lord is not impulsive, suddenly striking out in anger. That’s reassuring, especially when I consider the times I’ve lashed out at Him in anger or impatience. Also, He continually works to make me more like Himself. We can see God and His glory in His patience with us, the encouraging word of a friend, a beautiful sunset, or—best of all—the whisper of the Holy Spirit inside of us....Jesus is always compassionate, forgiving, and faithful and for that we can be forever grateful.                                             Welcome the abounding love of Yeshua (Jesus Christ) into your heart by acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord of your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. You will then be justified in salvation and your life will be forever changed!      May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️
U r the most underrated rapper next to NF,I don't know why people would rather prefer listening to those people who r mentioned in EM 2018 album kamikaze. It's probably cuz they r pretty dumb 😂💀,the son🔥tho
😳
the best bro great song
❤❤❤
One of his best songs 👍👌
If any man does not forsake all that He has, he can not be my disciple.  If any man seeks to save his life, he will loose it. If anyone looses it for my name sake He will find it.  There is not one man who has forsaken, house, lands, mother,  father, brother, sister, or children for Me, that will not gain 100 times more in this life, with persecution, and then everlasting life.  As our family seeks Truth that is vaguely testified of in books, these words have been our encouragement to remain continue to dennounce the system and what it offers including name, image, number, social security, benefits, privileges, wealth, and identity.  We have more to let go of, but for sure we are in great hands as we exchange death for life.  Come out of her my people and be pure and separate... For the merchants were the top men of the earth, and by sorcery were all nations decieved.  Yahuah be Magnified in Yahushua our Righteousness.  HallaluYah.  Shalum to the pure in heart.  May Yahuah save us and gather us together, that the heathen will no longer rule over us.  It is so.

Love you dax ur the best rapper in my opinion
What do you expect when dumb people have smartphones?.. Millennials biggest problem to not progress and trust any process
Bro this was fucking amazing keep up the good work man and keep up with DC comic reference its so good.
Dax=Legend
The way he expressed the new Culture of modern world is freakin crazy, Respect Brother your better than all the money chaser 🔥❤️ Edit:-Drax hearted this comment earlier but I edited bcs I had a spelling mistake and lol now the heart disappeared STILL LOVE YOU G.
"Fake shit goes viral we all know this won't" dax is a genius, and he was like 100k views
Thx dax man for everything! Even if you and ksi have had some complications but still! You are a better rapper!!! Thx for everything m8!
You're Broadcasting from another Dimension and they keep changing the channel👉📺 🗣🎤🔥🔥🔥
Love the music
He’s been my favorite rapper for a long time now and idk about anyone else but he keeps proving himself time and time again🥶
Dax be like “I’m hoping I can at least get 20,000 likes by Monday”, you’re better than that you’re almost 90,000, way over your goal.
Dax making truth hip hop music 💪🏿🙏🏿
not even robin can save anyone in the blast radius of the fire this "batman" dax is spitting
🤯🤯🤯 https://youtu.be/dE50nrQnbJM
At this point I expect Dax to never blow. Like a Drake. Never to see him on tv or on the radio. I can't see someone this authentic on the news or tv show. They aren't prepared or understand a man of this level of humble becoming successful. Everyone drags others under the bus. And Dax still at the bus stop wondering why he can't get a ride. He's too pure. Dax you're something special man. When my son Link gets older I'll introduce him to my top 5 and you're in it. Much love and respect keep making us think and share your wisdom bro idc how corny this sounds. You the truth! All love
WeRtheLabel 💯🔥💯🙏🏻🙏🏻
Are you awoke?
#24 in tendanceess duude let's goo
Damn.. Dax best with it bruh.. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Only a few months so many said dax couldn’t Make a hook and now can make some the best in the game
To all those saying they'll get rich and change things for the better:  I'm sure that's what a ton of people think or planned to do. Look at them now? It's best to stay away. Not everyone can say no to temptation over and over again
Like bro mans keep putting fire music out,and the thing about this song is its all FAX this is why i love this artist bro underrated bro 💪💯💯 keep it up bro
This is great
🔥🔥
I would love to see this as an animation.  Comic book style.
Just found about about this dude. He’s the next tech. Wicked bars

It is so weird whenever I am listening some how so is the entire street lol
Damn man no one told me Batman:Future State had a theme song.
Damn...it says 666K views 😈
Dax is always got a message and I love this one ❤ its 🔥 thanks for the great music
"A pupil who never becomes a master, does his own a disservice"
At least when your famous your voice can be heard. It’s people like us that mean nothing to the world.
Deep song, lyricism is next level
*So his  arch nemesis is himself in the dax dc*
People sleep on this goat 🐐
love this track! killed it again dax! love your music!
I don’t even listen to this kind of music regularly but I’m in love with this song 😍😍😍
It's dax
666k views damn weird
Dax keep doing it your my gad 👿 tell the haters to fuck off they can't understand something that's bigger than them just do it gad👿👿👿
I always get bored from rappers making the same type of music Dax always changes it idk why he isn’t bigger but this shows that he doesn’t even care if he’s big he’s a already a talented rapper people just need to catch up on the rap community and see that he is more lyrical and actually has messages in the music
i want a part 2 to JOKER!!!!!
Dude, you good??
I'm sleeping😑😑
Wow  songs with lyrics like these are rare these days.
absolutely amazing.
This song lyrics are really true. Nobody cares about you if your not famous. And people are always looking at you like  hmm what’s this dude wearing, oh what type of shoes does he have. I can relate to this in school
Glad you know..don't ever sell your soul! 😈🪐✡️🤫😅
this is real music @drake/nbayoungboy fans

Everyone is talking about the video but the words are straights facts and it’s crazy the metaphors and lines. Dax is still underrated af
And got on trending
I no how you feel  Psalms 51:17
I'm glad we waited for your return! Fire, and bars to made people think. Nicely done Dax, salute.
I been listening since self proclaimed 1 it's been a honour and a blessing to watch you grow into this power house of talent no body believed me when I told them you would be this great years later they claim they always believed
Play it in 1.25x this is a complete different song 🙌🏻
Ngl he looks like spongebob's pineapple house
the reference  to the part in batman where jason todd dies in the explosion because joker kidnaped him is incredible
WOW dax. another hit! heartbreaking. <3
🔥🔥🔥
I didn’t think he could get any better but he’s getting better and better every song.
Realest rapper 🔥 you need more recognition, crazy how a dude like Blueface gets more plays 🤦🏿

this guy is a genius
Sorry for the wait for me to comment fam been busy with work.
Damn🔥🔥🔥
Love this song
didn’t know batman was black lol
I only see talent, hard work, and dope a$$ lyrics here! 🔥
Dax is super talented but one cares just cuz he ain’t ‘’main stream’’ its really sad
This is more than music, it's a message 🔥
It’s sad because Dax, the man who can create amazing songs with deep meanings is less popular and recognized than people who make millions for saying fuck and the n word every bar.
Bangger 🔥
Blackman

This comment probably wont see the light of day but, Dax has come a very long ways in the last few years, its inspiring to see his growth. keep up the grind bother, keep up this great art!
Love when he sings
Fuckin right brother amazing song good for these days just what is happening!!!!!!!
True lines 🤯❤️
I don't know what went harder, this song or the time you had to say sorry to a dude you called out.
Dax, I literally love your shit. This was just amazing.
To all the girls and guys who have lots of social media followers, I hope this is a wake up call that no one cares about your profile except for you. It’s an ego booster and in reality you’re only hurting everyone viewing ur stuff and you’re hurting yourself by being numb to real life. Just be a normal human and get off the fu*king validation apps
Doesn’t everyone realize that this man right here likes every comment and puts his heart on every track? This guy right here is not a king, he’s not legend, not a myth, not a rapper, this guy right here is a living destroyer.....destroys every track and everything, amazing track Dax.
🔥🔥🔥 glad u are putting yourself in the right state mind lost to many rappers because they weren’t
Liked the song but wtf is that on your head lol
“They’ll say they care but will never show, Gotham isn’t just a place it’s a mind state, Watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow...”  We hear you dax...
🔥
Nice one dax  Love  this song ✅✅✅✅👍👍👍

Love the song and message, this spoke to me thanks for the content Dax keep it up man.
dax you are amazing

I really like how you combined real word with the whole comic book aspect of gotham
Aa huge fan from india love you dax
If you still liking comments Dax can you like mine
Bui yinno Dax  Different right 🔥🔥🔥 Your a true  artist The world don't like different and
Nolifeshaq sent me! This 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
camera man did a realy good job
So this is the real Dax🔥
FACTS
Good shit bruh

The people who DISLIKE this song, confirm it's Truth... Thank you Dax💓
We need more rappers like him.
Dax and Joyner Lucas would be killer. Change my mind.
Dax is back, DAx iS BaCk!, DAX is BACK!  He can't be, he never left but maybe I'm the crazy delusional one.
Loving all his comments, ofcourse. the most badass artist. DAX. Love you bro.
🔥🔥🔥
this hits hard
Dax only one did a batman and joker music video with a deep messenge in both 🔥🔥🔥
This is real rap 🔥newest rap song I liked in years
Dax only one did a batman and joker music video with a deep messenge in both 🔥🔥🔥

DOPE SHIT HERE
I literally tell everyone I know about you. I appreciate the hell out of your music man. Thanks for all you do.
ITS DAX!!
It’s DAX!
This is so deep and true my man!!!

Some smart stuff hope people can understand and learn
Dax and Hopsin are on fire right now
This song is lit and that’s facts because it’s Dax,
Great song
Batman  NO  BLACKMAN
Dax is goated 🐐 and always speaks the truth
Much love ❤️
MY IDOL IS BACK !!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🥺
Anyone have any insight into the line: "fakes real, and they say reals fake woke"
Another hit Dax don't miss  Keep it up you helping a lot of people with your music
Here before JJ
There is not a single doubt about the roads Dax has been on to get to this level. Being this good at storytelling doesn’t come without a pricetag to it.   The thing that keeps on inspiring me about Dax is that you can feel him. You Can relate to him. You can understand him. Well At least a i can.   Man Dax if you don’t mind then listen to me for a change.. Leave Gotham before its to late.  We can build so much better. I don’t doubt for a second that you’re woke. I don’t doubt for a second you know whats right and wrong. This song combined with older stuff proves enough.   Everyone needs a leaders voice to change a mindset this twisted. Be that voice. Or at least one of The voices.   As Tupac once said “I'm not saying I'm gonna change the world, but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world."   It has never been clearer. Stay real Dax, stay human, stay you.
Not a huge DAX fan but I’m not gonna lie this song is amazing 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Wow.
This is too deep it give me chills on god
TRUE SHIT HE SPEAKING
Beautiful
like your music. its the best
❤️❤️
No body from here but every one come here...... Happiness is not a physical place you call home ......join me 👇

Dope
Dreams
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I remember first listening to Dax back when he didn't even have 100k views in one day. To see him grow as the years pass has been a privilege. I can definitely say that he has been a huge influence for me as a musical artist.
My boy Dax out here exposing bot behavior in this matrix 💯🔥‼️
his choruses suck
Dax is a fucking star in the making I can't wait to see him all over world wide charts for his videos and songs
Dax is joker AND batman now?
True talent 🔥
I love your music thank you for this❤
We gotta get this 200k to get Joker pt2!!!!
Always keeping it real
Suits wack, music fucking slaps though 10000x
goodjob bro!
Dude.. How are you able to come up with such content man?? Your zone in game is if the chart bro.. Keep it up
As much as I love KSI, you can’t discredit this man as an Artist. From the Visuals to the Lyrics he is Very Underrated 💯 been a fan of his music for ages, idc if you dislike him cuz KSI says so, Dax is talented 🔥
Got a Gotham tv show ad too
Dax you fire
Im in love 😍 the only Artist who makes me gone cry while i'm fell my inner demons fight
Another track i cant quit listening to bro! I love all your words man!
I didn’t know side show bob made music 🎶
Dax should go out for the static shock roll
Is this Macklemore?
Mierda 💩
I would like be small Fortune famous. Enough to provide without thinking what to do for the next month and have real voice on some things. Being too famous I feel like it would change me too much and I would lose myself, everything, and everyone I hold close. Without them their is no real happiness just fake smiles. Money is just corruption the more you have the more ppl change weather it's you or your friends/family.
John 3:16-21 ESV  “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God."  1 Corinthians 15 ESV  "15 Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, 2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,"  Acts 2:37-39 ESV  "37 Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”  38 And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself."
What a banger! 🔥
0:41 the flow in the next 20 seconds here is so smooth holy shit

JJ WAS WRONG!!
Every one like this I want to listen to the rest of joker he never released
Yo..this speaked volumes man I cried man your not just an artist your a creator on your own level... I love this man
Absolutely amazing 🖤❤
Dax thank you for your music
only reason he ain't up there top charts is not because he ain't a commercial rapper but because he talks facts and speaks it in the realest of ways and just like he mentions in this song ''fake shit goes viral'' well he's fucking right because he ain't going viral. Well he is but not as much as he deserves it and that's all because the media, record labels etc do not want to promote someone that talk the truth, ultimately they are afraid.
🔥
the delivery is sooo good. keep up the work
Love it keep it going! From Israel 🔥♥️🇮🇱
Say janitor
Brabo
This goes mad hard 🔥

<3
The best song since 2020💥
Hard af
Another banger on the books Pure facts in this track🔥🔥
Don't like many of the newer rappers I've come across in the last few years (not for lack of giving them a try).  That said this is one of the rare modern rappers thats worth a listen.
When Dax takes over Eminem, he's not gonna be known for rapping fast,barely making any sense and rapping about his mom's spaghetti. He's gonna be known for preaching what we all know but don't speak:  *The truth.*
Loki Dax should be an Actor no cap
Waited patiently an once again I love his depth along with the truth he speaks. #thankyoudax
Anyone waiting for our fat neek JJ to react to this lol
This is a really good message. Like it’s factual💯. Love it. Keep doing what you’re doing. From Janitor to this is amazing.
Corny
I mean I know he dope, but he have more subs than Strange Music???? Not by much but still!! Grew faster than Tech??!?!?!?!? 🤣🤣
Love it Dax. Missed you. ❤️
Wtf is that hair
Holy shit bro. Damn, so dope man Edit. Going to be bumping this song hard

"Gotham Isn't Just A Place It's A Mind State Watered By The Thoughts That Manifest What You Grow"-Dax 👉That Line Is #Superb Dope Song By The Way
Fake profits on the screen huh? Kinda sounds like you.
Dax's lyrics has really evolved over the years and I'm all for it
Very deep. Keep pushing, the real art always wins.

Honestly, the world needs to hear your music.. it’s so sad to see how disillusioned people have Become, so lost in things that are meaningless, losing what is truly means to love and be alive... and the real kicker, we did it to ourselves... keep at it Dax! You have become a top favorite artist with me and my mom! I can’t wait to hear more of what you have in store!
I hope y’all listening to lyrics
This was 🔥
PROTECT DAX AT ALL COST💯
KSI can't say you can't make a song with a chorus now
Batman: Im the hero gotham needs Redhood: Im the hero it deserves  Dax: Im the hero with bars of steel
I made a track called GOTHAM. where i impersonate Solomon Grundy and The Riddler. Check it out on my channel!
Ay yo thats nice
The hook is a stolen melody from cmob or prozak
Yess my boy is back💆🏾‍♂️✨
Yo
He become the Villain and then the Hero
Amazing🔥
Fireeeeeee🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
This is what we need Dax u came along way my guy don't switch up on us u the closest we have to what we call home in hip hop
Dax this is amazing man, the feel is really there in your lyrics something you cant explain.
My love song
This is fucking crazy I remember my sister showing me his ricegum distract years ago and I though he was pretty good but didn't expect this good music from dax
Rapping Stoicism✅
so must
Mind blowing
i’m fucking glad dax is back, hate him or love him he’s lyrically clever, and keep a flow going. same with the videos and ideas. he is natural raw talent!!🔥🔥
So you just copy and paste huh no original stuff😂 copying another rapper's work is not a talent its showing us how you have no ideas for your music 😱and it's getting old now 😒we know you got bars so make some original stuff .😬
Respect brother.
Showing love for what is real,  taking some time off from the Matrix, that was a good move! More people (myself included), got to remember what its like to be human. It is written, the lie is always going to be easier to be believed than the truth. The truth is heavy lifting and demands accountability, plus all the things not marketable by societal standards.
This is gotham’s national anthem 🔥🦇🃏
I can't even express how underrated this man is.  A true rapper, and deserves WAY more love than weirdos and criminals like 6six 9nine.  I can tell he pours his blood sweat and tears into his music.  "Don't expect anyone to believe your dreams it wasn't theirs in the first place" (self proclaimed 2 i think)
OMG this song hits hard it's a really good song I've been waiting for u to put this song out and it blew my mind how well this song is... And I've had this sing on repeat ever since it came out keep up the great work man all love to u and your music
So true dax good job
Istg, dax is the most underrated rapper ever 🔥🔥🔥🔥
And is batman represent your truest self, Bruce Wayne represent your social media self and batman saves you represent you're searching for your truest self recently?
Wait, Dax, did you talk about the woke stuffs in the rap? That's cool, so you know that spiritual awakening in 2020 don't you Dax?
Prince EA lookin ass
Damn, Gotham seems like they need someone to clean up there streets. If only there was a talented rapper who was a janitor who could clean it up. Oh yeah ITS DAX. This song was dope

Almost unliked when I was trying to like twice    Dax ur a fucking beast thank u for this masterpiece.
I stumbled dax one day a while back and added straight to Playlist. Not many people speak the truth with there music. Well done 👏
i dont wanna be famous or have a lot of money because i dont want attention or fake people asking me for money i wanna be the way i am now and never change cuz im happy the way i am even tho there are many fake people in my life rn i can always tell them to fuckk off and they will leave if im famous they wont and if i have money they will keep asking until i lose my shit so id rather be poor and a ghost for others than being famous
Dax I'm a big fan keep up the good work

Everyone's saying these lyrics are deep and have real-world meaning, yet no one is saying how.
For the style of music dax makes, I consider him one of the best. I feel the words, the beat, and the vibe and they all connect in perfection and I just listen and ride while my mind expands and I feel the growth he has made as an individual. 💯💯💯 keep it up 🔥🔥🔥
For all the bois who were on the lives yesterday..... GOT EM TRENDING BOII!!!

I don’t know what to say this is inspiring
You never fail to amaze...Every song you create is lyrically genius. "I be shaking when I write my music I’ve been anti-v*olent but don't push me cause I just might do it" & "Gotham isn’t just a place it’s a mind state Watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow" ... chills. THANK YOU! thank for your music. Your transparency helps more people than you know & think. Such a huge stan. we love you dax. <3
Well said dax, love the tune, alot of truth in it. keep up the good work 👍
These intellectual ass songs get me man, I run for a minimum of an hour with all the thinking they provoke within me. Much appreciation for your music 🖤
Fire!
This is harder tho 🙏🏽 https://youtu.be/k6s0jjbsrj0
Really awesome stuff,  thank you

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Excellent
This was awesome. So much substance!!! New fan here
🔥👌💯 I always said Gatham is our world in a nutshell.
The chorus got me 😢 🔥
Dax is a definition of a pure talent and hardwork
This song is amazing
Let me guess, you're a janitor?
Wow man, AMAZING 💪
Bro, you really outdid yourself with this one big time. Wow. A1 lyricism, the story-telling is so damn vivid, passionate + memorable hook (your vocals have improved so much), visuals complement every single line from start to finish.. Next level stuff 🔥🏆
It's clear this dude is trying very hard to succeed.
❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️
All of the dislikes are KSI fans. Even me😂
This song is perfect for e-girls and twitch thots....
Instead of listening to the music I hear the words and they hit different when they relate to you
Dax the only artist out there makes me even want to start typing out comments.  Always REAL, all the time.  Mad respect for that.  Videos are getting so good that it makes me realize Dax probably made for movies too.  I could only imagine the fruits of wisdom with Dax as producer or antagonist on some silver screen ish...
He went from Joker to Batman real quick
Did you know he used to be a janitor
Much love bro
Nothing but fax, good ass song (kinda corny tho)
I don’t wanna be famous I just want to be respected and loved and I already know I have to give respect to earn it but if they  play me like a fool than that’s them.🤷🏾‍♂️🗣
They neeeeeed to use this song in the new batman Movie if they get the chance to and this is so good 🔥🔥🔥
You had me at "dumb ppl with smart phones. Liked. BTW the beat? Omfggggg bro
LOVE!💜
@dax YOU ARE GODD!
Much love dax..from nigeria...keep the fire coming❤❤..
The really deep meaning, I mean bruh you can't hate on this..

"Living in GOTHOMMM..."
🤯
This is wonderful. Spittin Fax
Im really enjoying the gotham-joker bits wonder if their will be a riddler?
The very first song i listened to was joker and i felt every word because it was happening to me. I listened to more of your songs and i love them all. I know you wont see this but please dont stop singing some people need to listen to your songs like me. Keep up the awsome work
Great song ❤ I literally cry happy tears when I listen to him ☺
Fucking love you dax never stop the grind
Dax is seriously the most underrated and disrespected rapper out there,one of the best lyricists out there
Not bad 💪💣
Holyyy shit thats a masterpiece
Gotham isn't just IA place it's a mindset damn that hits
Dax my boy thanks for coming back I needed some music that could inspire me to not focuse on being validated because I always wanted to be famous but now I don't because I'm not gonna be happy even if I do.
Keep doing what you do man.....one of the realest out there💪🏼
DAX IS BACK

Parabéns jovem Dax merece muito respeito tem um flow daqueles pesados e nois irmão
To answer your question, not very badly. Being "famous" comes with its ups and downs. As does being "normal". The most important thing is being happy about being yourself. Which can be tough or easy depending on your mentality and environment. Anyway, DOPE TRACK. Love the topics you explore in your music.
Love you dax keep doing what you do
One of his best .
When someone calls your mom gay on the internet

Dax really out doing himself ❤️ Dr Dre come sign him 👣💣
*Ladies & Gentlemen please let's not take DAX for granted* This man never cheat us out of great contents, he goes all in or nothing  Think about the process from writing these *masterpiece* tracks, to recording them, then to bring us breathtaking *visuals* to go with them.  That's *hard work* & *dedication* .  He don't do it for *GOTHAM* , he does it for us. the fans who don't just *hear* but *listen* ....... *IT'S DAX*
One of the rappers who most deserves respect. Hugs from Brazil!
Definitely not religious...  But I think the Bible said something about false idols   Sure reminds me a lot of Twitter/YouTube/News media today
This has left me speechless it's real

This is awesomeeeee!!! Not only the rap was amazing but the music video was firreeee Better than the shit KSI posts which is the same thing over and over again, notice how quiet KSI has been bout Dax since he started putting out these fire songs. Keep up the good ass work Dax!
Sounds dope to me
Your songs are so deep and meaningfull, I love your music Dax, stay woke ppl, keep your eyes open, god bless 💕✨
AMAZING!!!! This is what real rap sounds like !!

But this is  our society i mean  even under this video some people just write comments for likes. If you not connected to the internet you dont exist for most people. this song is fire  In Germany we have a phrase for Songs that are so dope like this. the phrase goes like  "Bruder richtiges Brett mach Weiter so"
I hope this song gets the recognition it deserves.
DOOOOOOPE
Holy hell this is awesome 👏
Why was this Batman themed lmao

Lol this is tight Dax. I got a song called Gotham on my profile I dropped a month ago. Lots of blood in my song too just not with the budget you have, check it out if you see this comment.

U are Amazing. If nobody else tells you that. You are truly the shit
DOPE and A L W A Y S has a message. DAXMOND HAS RETURNED.

@thatsdax
One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them✌️
Great great song 💯
Smart phones are for the media to take control of you and to lie about life. This songs seems like a message not to believe the media
Dude he pops off about the real world,  we all know this is true.
He did it again 💯💯🙌🏻🙌🏻
Its contradictory that you have good lyrics but they come from you and i feel they dont deserve the credit you think they do
This is why I love Dax. He speaks literal facts every time he speaks, and he puts it in such a good melodic way. Dax, I hope you succeed in such a big way. You inspire me in so many ways. Much love from West Virginia!!
Did you guys know he used to be a janitor?

Dax got a habit of taking song titles
That hook tho🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If you don't have a checkmark, you don't get a check Mark Yes, things may be that dark, but we all end up like Mr. Stark At the end of the day fuck what they have to say Either go all the way or don't even bother to play You want something? Go and get it It's all or nothing, just keep at it.   Man, these type of songs really can help some people who are aiming for the stars, while being stuck staring at the moon.
Dwight Howard turn his back to the lakers and decided to follow his real passion music. AMAZING!!

The world needs more Dax! Im not even a huge hip hop fan traditionally but your stuff is so real, that it's fire!
I like the outfit.
Damn this is🔥 keep up the good work my guy
Some good stuff here
Dax wsp how u doing
Song has quite a few lines about people just wanting to steal others money and fame and all I’m seeing in the comments are shitty reaction channels spamming replies to everyone trying to do exactly what he’s preaching against. Sickeningly ironic...
Self made, hard working & with my dignity, sure 💯👍🏽 great song man! Glad I found out about you a few months ago
this was hard Dax
Let's goooooooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Good ass song, keep it going man 🔥🔥
Songs great!! PS-Nice callback to Jason!!
“dumb people got smart phones” basically twitter

I love how this song just talks about how people only care about you when your in a high place but once you fall they just kick you in the dirt. The fact that people act fake just to keep their place in the system is crazy but here dax is just being himself and working hard and still some people don't notice. 👀
He deserves billion of views
Damnn nicee Fax💕💕
bower
Very glad I have my friends listening to you now. They all say you are becoming one of their new favorite artists to listen to.
This is so real🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
First song I've ever heard from Dax..... absolute banger. Incredibly real and a music video that feels more like a story. Amazing start to a career I need to start following
It's dax, 🔥🔥🔥
Hollywood
Yo this is a dope song dax
good choice to put a smile in city's face
Legendary 🔥
It’s sad how all the lyrics in this are 100% true
He still be a janitor tho
You never needed XXL
this fire.
Its in the german trends👀
1:23 That's the same font in Arkham Origins I don't know if its a coincidence or not though
Dax is too woke
Damn, what have I been doing with my life...
Been waiting for him to drop some fire  Never disappointed
Its dax!!!
Would never want to be famous, would love the money, but fuck the fame. Clowns want fame.
Love it !!!
This one is a real hit bro
You're amazing brother 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i found this song on snapchat and lowkey its not bad at all
Gotham = Los angeles
this is real life!!!! 🔥🔥🔥 DAX = TRUTH
Fan points +99 That's dope
we miss you  Strong comeback .....This is the Dax I know
Life’s been real since for me for as long as I can remember :/ never got to be a kid but Dax always got heat !
Wowwwwwww super 🔥
ITS DAX
Not sure if I showed gratitude in my last comment.  But thank you for your introspective.
I hope that he talked about the snowflakes on social media, this generation is so soft and stupid. Sad that I'm part of gen z.
Always bring the heat...Thanks again..for giving me something to place on repeat.
Your rap is always so real
people dont even notice their own greed for fame anymore. It has come to a point where people only see the problem but dont count themselves...
Wow bro
Nice trak 👍👍👍 keep it up Dax
Dax for president of music #Daxforking 💃🧡♥️🤸‍♀️🔥🔥🔥🔥
“Dumb people got smart phones”
dax you go crazy everytime
dax is ded
great job. you still fire ❤️
17 on trending congrats brother
Never disappoint!!so dope ...No.1 fan🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇰🇪
Dax been quiet....until now!!!
Love him or hate him, dax is spitting straight fax
This is somebody I can listen to knowing that he is just gonna spit facts and not what everybody else is saying, for example. Some artist speak of drugs and some will speak of truth. He is one of the artist who speak of the truth and the facts in this world but the problem in today's rap industry they only speak of what they are doing now such as making money smoking and doing drugs. Other rap artist speak of what happended in the past and how they wish they could've changed it and he is that rapper
Welcome back🔥🔥
That's amazing Dax 🔥
Shit is a banger like usual happy yr back
dax really a goat in the making
Finally this is what I've been waiting for love your music man it has a real message to it and I love that and bro maybe if you make an album or sum you could finally get 2021 freshman because you rlly deserve it and your underrated❤❤❤

"You need me! I'm the answer to your life's question! Without me, you're just a joke without a punchline." ~Jeremiah Valeska

Hey dax are you melodic, or lyrical   Dax: yes
This was so true. I like how he is using the social media to break the normal of social media.

Return he didn't leave
Wow
Smartphone addiction will be the end of this generation!
Respect ✊
Wanna hear this in the new Batman movie
This man is throwing facts❤️❤️ "Your young now but wait until you grow old, when life gets real u'll remember all the words I wrote"....... The first 40 seconds were lit⚡⚡⚡⚡🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️😎😎😎
*That was legitness*
Everyone knows he's not talking about Gotham..
Bro just hits me. Damn
Dax is the only rapper who's real.
Bruhhhhh tf 🤯🔥🔥🔥
Dax  !! This song was great, and you have an amazing, truthful message in this video. You address  so many problems the main stream media does't wont you to hear. I love how you talk about how controlled society is, especially now. The internet has helped contributed to that. But at the same time it is what spreads your message and other people trying to escape from the authoritarianism of Gotham. You were so on point with this project. For example in the 70's we questioned our country for an unnecessary wars over seas. And our military attacks other countries for resources all the time and know one questions it now. We shutdown because of Covid which brings millions out of jobs, and millions on the streets. Other countries didn't shutdown and their economy was fine, and they had barely any deaths. Yet we still trust our government. And look up to the powerful who don't give a fuck about humanity. The saddest part of this whole song is when the news headline said batman saved you. You tried to fight off "gotham" but lost and batman rescued you. This tells me that in "gotham" the modern corupt society we live in, normal people can't be heroes. And thats why you were Batman, because you were holding yourself. Because everyone wants to have power. But when they get it. They only save themselves. Literally in this video. And this is why our world doesn't change, and this video represents it so well.
Everything this man sings about touches me such as my heart my soul and I feel it his words are exquisite his rhymes are artistic there's not a song that I do not like that dax puts out keep it up dax we need more people like you in this world with your views and your visions thank you for all the time you take to put out your music I hope you get to see this comment
The lead of Shadows is the elite Bane there's a soldier for the Illuminati that has no voice he's dead Batman the rich Playboy all these characters in Batman make it short is all one demon
Everybody has a gotham song and soon mines will reach the notice it desires. Thank dax for your contribution.
pretty fire

This genuinely is the reason I don't care to have any social media applications
I find it inspiring he is using his name, much deserved fame, & hip hop platform to send positive messages, address world issues, & invoke deep thinking in all of us. He is inspiring the youth, while also reigniting the fire in adults..  It is so damn refreshing to hear good music, great beats & fire lyrics,  that has a deep rooted message that also helps provoke self reflection.
The kings back
Heat
Holy shit amazing
Music video was stupid as shit😂 loved the song though!
Who else thinks DAX speaks a lotta facts in his songs?
Every song has a meaningfull story behind it. PAY Attention. Dax is WOKE.
dope ass track dax its 🔥🔥
Dax is back! Spread the word!
His words hold so much weight to me.
You are so cool man! 👊
i dont wanna be famous i just wanna be remebered
DAX I LOVE YOUR MUSIC AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ONES VERY INSPIRATIONAL ALL LOVE MAN❤
Much love dax! Im a HUGE fan!!! Its crazy how u say what alot of us  feel but we can never really find the words like u do and to put it into lyrics makes it even 100 x's better bro.....much love and bless u:)
Listening to this song made me realize how much I missed ur music 🔥🔥🔥🔥🇿🇦🇨🇦
Amazing track Dax. Keep telling your story.
Its DAXMAN
My favourite rapper, absolutely love this guy
This is the reason why I'm a dax fan💯
💪💪💪
This is awesome, first joker (which was pure art the way he did it) now gotham. Dudes like goku, no limits. Keep up the fantastic work, dax my man... I think of him saving himself, as dax saving daniel or vise versa. Then again it does say he was saved by the bat, so there's that. I was thinking because one has to protect his alter ego to protect themselves and everyone around them, kinda like the bat.
Here before a million views. Big Fan Of You Man. D for #Doppestdax
Dope bro keep climbing to great heights my dude 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gottem
The message is deep dude

JESUS IS COMING   Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin   THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!! JESUS is COMING BELIEVE AND AND ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR TRUST IN HIM TODAY GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK  DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY

He won no military battles yet conquered the world.He commited no crime, Yet he was put to death. He was buried in a tomb yet lives today. His name is Jesus.
Fireee🔥
Damnnn crazy brooo💥💥💥
🔥🔥🔥

This song is a banger 🔥
6389 lol
Welcome back Dax
Fire
I've been wainting for this.. so dope :3
Keep speaking the truth Dax ! I love this shit !!! .👌
DAX clearly knows that fame and fortune is worthless. People literally just persue it to become validated and feel worthy.Not knowing that God himself willingly stepped down from his throne,lived a holy and obedient life.A life no one would ever attain because of sin and sacrificed himself so that we might have eternal life.  Now if that doesnt make you feel worthy then i dont know what will.Knowing that the being that created you cares for you that much because EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD IS TEMPORARY.
You have my respect! I rate you so much‼💯 Your lyrics are hard to swallow but they're real and that's what matters‼💯😌🙌
I am a new fan of dax and I will say that I am seeing a big part of Eminem in this guy I hope we can see a new defrent version of the slim shady ✊🏼
Can we get an album?
Fuck fame its lame dam shame people doing anything for some recognition with no intuition we all grave power we don't grow like flowers but who am I to judge I once seeked it all till I saw the evil in it but the lord 🙏 really working with me I crawled out of a dark place tied my shoe lace to continue my race to reach breach the key of success once I get acess to all the fruits I will pass them out so u don't be come a tool there's light in every dark place just search harder become the next bruce wayne.
So fucking good
Fridge
Damnn!!! Woah this one's one more blockbuster ♥️⚡⚡

Here he is once again getting a so cold ❄ yet emotional fuelled message across again like he never left a man on a mission he must have a pen so lethal tucked away somewhere in that bat suit or it's simply in the utility belt . wit wordplay , double entendres straight up fire 🔥 plus punchlines so hard hitting along side a video pure qaulity ! but who are you I'm DAX 🦇 !!  This man always delivers never disappoints each and every time ! all a madness .. Bless up . ✌📿💯
Thank you Dax for keep music 💯 during this time in uncertainty and fear. We really need more people like you to push forward and shine a light through this constant negativity.
Wow. Everything from the video, the message. It's all insane 🔥🔥🔥 and lil hook in there as well . Sheesh
People pass this knowledge around. Hopefully we will infect some of the morons with the red pills.  Thank you DAX.
Would have called it Jerusalem
This is turnt up in all the right ways
Bro i love this song it makes alot of fax and its all true
For some reason when he said “I’ve been anti violent, but don’t push me I might just do it” I thought of torey lanez lol. Dax was so calm when torey was being tough with his homies but in reality Dax could break toreys lil ass
Dax is 🐐. Fax I wrote😁
Alright time to stop playing now in 2020, Dax should be making big hit movies.
The world needed this song these are the deep thoughts we struggle to bring to the surface😐
If this isn't in the next batman movie or joker film then there missing out
This is so hard
When dumb people have smart phones.....so powerful
Dqx lowkey wana be an actor. Joker vid, gotham vid, he wants to be a hero/villian
So lit im your fans from Philippines
This is by far the most relevant topic in today's world.....i have kids in their 20s and the social media storm can cloud minds.....good stuff young man
Missed you bro🔥🔥🔥🔥
💜💜💜💜
U look better with glasses
Welcome back!
Ay does Dax have smoke with memes now?
This guy is just legit✔️😎
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
"You think you need this place but you don't. Happiness is not a physical place you call home."
Dax is in a whole new lvl
🦇 *E P I C* 🦇
Got damn Dax are like becoming NF with the moody s***Oh my God that was for real dope i never knew this other side of you!
daxs hair is getting too tall
I cried

It's dax glad 𝓯𝓸𝓻  𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓻𝓮𝓽𝓾𝓻𝓷...
Thankful that you are back!!
fireeeeeeeeeee
Album with this style = game over.
This is just so lyrically fire 🔥😍
Could write and rap a song for me please my life’s not going well . Pls 😔
😎
I gotta say though as much as I love your rapping, your singing voice is insane.
The hook is very good  Support from germany The message is we life in gotham city
Bro, this is probably the best one I've heard.  IG: Lhosttown Could you hit me up so we can talk about some things?
Pfffffffff on fireeeeee 🔥🔥🔥
Good to see ya bk doing what ya do best
I had a ad for Gotham lol
Safe to say this is in reference to Hollywood????
So much truth to his music!  Unreal this video has under 100,000 likes but put a trashy ass one up with guns, murder and calling girls HOES and it has millions in the first hour!  Keep spitting those words DAX!
ITS DAX! I Like and then listen.
Tbh i dont realy like dax, but this song is LIT.
While listening to it a LOT times it becomes an even bigger and better MASTERPIECE! My man is on a different level! IMPACT! PREACH! LYRICAL GENIUS! ONE OF THE BEST IN THE GAME! DAX FOR LIFE💯🐐
What I don’t understand is why dislike the video ?🤔
Another masterpiece with the message! Thanks DAX!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its all fun and games till Daxman shows up
The King is back
Strait fire 🔥  Like he said         Wack ass rappers. He isn’t that
am i the only one? BATDAX XDDDD
fucking fire lets go
Don't let them pigeon hole you as JUST a rapper you are much more
You’re the king right now 👑 🎤
🔥🔥🔥
The 499 people who disliked why are you gey
Let talk. Opened eyes think alike!
People don't actually realise how symbolic this actually is
Dax is a goat don't even tryna debate
Been waiting for this
so nice
why would someone dislike this track bro smh
Spitting truth again, just like your suppose to. Respect and good vibes 🌻
lets stop saying his a rapper and only letting him be that he’s a artist 🥶
Best mood (cold city night)
Dj khaled would say "another one"
IT WAS GOOD BUT THE SMART PHONE AND THE FIRST SINING PART TO IM JUST SAYING I COULD NEVER DO BETTER THOUGH
Okay, okay, Dax. This is too dope. LOVE the concept of what comes with fame💪🏽
Can stand that mop on he's head 🤣 shave it  definitely looks like a mop
"they just see you as a number they see you as human just a puppet they replace for their amusement" That bar is so true in our society. For me I view everyone human famous or not but for some I respect their music. But for @Dax I respect not only his music but who he is as a person. We have a lot in common and someone I can relate, but some of these other rappers out here they just want to talk about the money, women, and fame. #Daxismyfavoriterapper
fucking amazing
Love the song my dude, that's some real shiz. I wanna make it, and I wanna help push others forward.   Like a silent alarm they call when ur famous, looking at you to describe their heinous. Pushing through to hurt you only to realize just like anyone else ur human too.  Don't let them break you, don't let them cause ur fall. Ur health and well being is most important of all. In the end ur a good person, though most people will ignore that cause they haven't followed the lesson.  Ur one of the greats my dude, don't let anyone put u on a pedestal. If they do, then say "fuck you"  Love u dax, I give the best of wishes
Phoenix Jones liked this

0% Girls 0% Money 0% Cars 0% Fancy House 0% Financial Stability This is my current situation, please help.  (btw this is a joke so don't tell me to "get a job" lmao)

Ohh..he's just catering a different side of the mind.....
'Consumed by the algorithm it becomes clear life’s a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer' - puppeteer's lost control of the a. i.
So damn good.
Anyone that dont think Dax is a top ten rapper out right now dont know rap.I want him an Token to do a track
Let's check his mopping record
First the Joker, now Gotham. This man's ability to use metaphor is divine. One of the best tracks I've heard this year, from anyone in music. Not just rap or youtube but everywhere. 👍🔥🌋🔥👍
i don't want to be famous , i want to go in gotham
I’ve only liked 3 raps till now and subscribed to only 2 rappers this song and you are one of them .
New song😘😘😍😍😍😍😍Love Dax

This song got me on 💯✔ Meaning of Gotham though
I FUCKS WITH THIS ONE ^
Hahahahah this guy
meh, feels a bit repetitive now DX
Dude us his fans arent tjose kids who only comment some dumbshit and im glad king is back
I agree with every word in this song, so damn true. The masses are legally enslaved and they dont even know it.
All those dislikes are from those dumb people that got a smart phone!😏
How badly do you wanna be famous?  Me:well really, I don't ever wanna be famous I just wanna write songs for my people so they can see what I'm sayin' I don't wanna be like these other people chasin' money for clout if you really think I tried to do this for 2 years just for the money to count then your wrong social media's already picking em' out. Especially in gotham, I've been there a few times, got robbed, beat until screamed and cried then I met the hero dax he wrote songs to save the lives. He made them for the socially ill so would think to even have to think about pain and suicide. Yeah, everyone loses control but sometimes you gotta pray for hope. I understand that your frustrations got you right by your throat but god has nothing but hope. Wake up one morning and sit in a chair then stare at the walls that you live and repair how do feel? Heavenly? weak, strong? Maybe but trying to piece this all together isn't gonna get you anything maybe a message that's breaking your mind open but I'm glad this the life that I've chosen....and these are gonna be same lines that people have stolen.  #Gotham #Dax
Sooo Glad you’re back.... your words always enlighten me ❤️ Love from Ghana 🇬🇭
Nah dax is just something else🔥
Dope

Dax is fire
That's woke
So dope 💯💯
Dax you did it again 👏 Another hella good track ♥️
great brather.. ❤️ 🇧🇩🇧🇩
❤
🙌🙌💯
Could of left the autotune out.  All of the Marshal beats you've done remixes to have been great until you autotune the end and honestly that's probably why Marshal or Dre have not called you yet. You should know Marshal don't like autotune.
Dax you just might be the greatest rapper to ever bless a microphone ! Salute to you sir 💪🏾
How are you gonna be Batman......and Joker?
DAX ❤🔥
Your lyrics are facts! Every song again and again. Your amazing!
alternate ver. of jason todd
I always knew from the first song a heard from him that he was beast!! Get'em DAX
I think that we're headed down the wrong road Fakes real and they say real's fake woke False prophets on these screens everywhere we go But what did you expected when dumb people got smart phones More memes cool make it all a big joke Crown your fake kings and let them sit up on your fake thrones You're young now but just wait until you grow old When life gets real you'll remember all these words I wrote I went roaming walked multiple ways For 40 nights 40 sleeps yes multiple days In the dessert no food water searching for the answers But you listen to these people who got nothing to say You wouldn't know real if it slapped you right in the face Ain't for the culture I can tell by the shit you embrace I'm in Gotham but my minds in a different place So Fuck your co-signs, money, and your radio play I be shaking when I write my music I've been anti-violent but push me cause I just might do it They won't give you no credit cause they know you'll use it And that's the happen when the master starts fearing the student In this city you're a number they don't see you as human Just a puppet they replace for their games and amusement In a city full of angles with the biggest influence I see demons with a platform who just fucking abuse it  In Gotham...  Everybody knows everybody If you ain't got a blue check you ain't anybody Redo, repeat, sleep, double tap, see copy Lost souls unaware they're turning into dead zombies Everywhere you look is plastic all fabricated Everything you've seen on TV was exaggerated Don't nobody see you till you get a million Followers and when you do they treat you Like you're someone and you're validtated What do you do? How much money you make? Who do you know? What do you drive? Where do you stay? And while you're answering those questions They'll be calculating how much of it they can see themselves trying to come in take If you're fragile don't you even try come to this place They gon build you just to break you then rebuild you to break Let you reach your own limit then heroically save and that's exactly how Gotham turn you into a slave  In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose they're souls cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your mind in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Nobodies from here But everybody come here Wanting to be famous Till they realize the price of fame brings close everything that they once feared Consumed by the algorithm it becomes clear life's a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer Blind people leading blind people driving cars to a destination that unclear while they can't steer 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 Drugs alcohol addiction morgue Fake friends women goldigging as a sport Who convince you, you should live a whole life you can't afford Nobody sees you, you're continuously ignored Everyone wants fame they don't care what it's for They don't wanna build theirs, They're just trynna take yours This is dog eat dog in this messed up world  You think you need this place but you don't Happiness is not a physical place you call home Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel when you take that time away from your phone Fake shit goes viral we know this won't They'll say they care but will never show Gotham isn't just a place it's a mind state Watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow  In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose they're souls cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your mind in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls Cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Don't tell em how you feel cause I promise they won't call back Everybodies in it for money so it's all bad Killing off my demons I'm rapping this I'm all black I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta Prove nothing to Gotham They ain't done nothing for me... for me
Damn who jumped him?
Dax 🔥🔥🔥 Glad to see yo bro. 🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹
Dax roasted the whole generation 👌
Very good 👍🏻
Joker and dear god mix=
To be famous by my self and the only help I want is my family but if I don't it's okay, because I know theirs more out there for me. I let god chose and if he says that shit ain't for me fine then. I'll do it the right way.
A masterpiece! We in a matrix...called Gotham
That's another banger like each and every song of urs, so glad of your return, welcome back legend.

هل انا العربي الوحيد
Did anyone else notice how he used eminem's flow in the "1year 2year 3year 4, drugs alcohol addiction morgue" line
This song is fire 🔥. I LOVE YOUR MUSIC
Like how he’s subtlety calling out the music industry and their “ Ways “
🤩🥰🥵
Soooo fireeeee
Why isn't this trending
Not gonna dislike but not gonna either
Hey dax,  your an amazing artist and I've watched almost all of your music. Its helping in this very hard time for me and your right you dont remix music you make somthing different and then pay homage. Thank you for being you and keep doing what your doing. :)
A great truth spoken that everyone ignores
Its dax!
Dax my man this song was the shit
"I'm in GOTHAM but my minds in i different place, so fuk your cosigns money and your radio plays"!! Yet again you bring more fire for the BBQ grill. Keep'em coming fam!!
Ever come across a lowkey artist u just know is gonna blow up one day? Usually keep these gems to myself. Still under 100 views 🤯  https://youtu.be/Eg0VMxhq3NA
If man was on Flow and Rhythm he would win no cap
Dax is litrealy the best
Return of the king. 👑
Wow 🔥
Very cool!
It's DAX 🤘👐👐
i like the fact that Dax is a batman fan who stayed lyrical in the mumble era.
the goat 🐐 🔥
Man, I'm French and I'm living in France but I'd like to tell you that your words are very touched in the heart. Your message is coming up so far because it's so powerful. (I know there's a lot of chance you can't see this comment but I wanted to tell you)
Bro you never fail to impress👊💯 I don't want to be famous not worth it. Rather have a stable life with real friends than being famous and being surrounded by back stabbers and snakes. 💯 Stay true to you! 👊
I'm finna guess that Dax really likes Batman
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
B..B..Banger..😎🔥🔥
DaX ! * Stay True | Stay Real *
I swear I feel every song Dax drops💔😔dead inside
Eminem ,Dr. Dre pliz support DAX he deserves all the love ..
GIMME HEART AND REPLY SAYING HELLO OMEGA  have a great day :>
Better than all mumble fucking rappers ,  U BANGER!! 🔥
The king has returned.
Lyrically I’ll admit Dax is really good but his choruses ain’t been it😂🔥
THIS is AMAZING 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song speaks so much truth
Ur music is always on point..🔥 keep spreading the truth 👌
Dax just keep getting better and better. The videos are insane as well
Iz dax 💥🇰🇪💥
Very nice song !!! I love all your songs ❤
Dax like the cringey kid who is obsessed with The Joker lmfao.
I love this it’s amazing 🤩
Some decent points regarding how vacuous fame is.  Of course most of the people you're criticising have no substance - that's a given, but the problem is not that Dax is undervalued as some fans are claiming here - it's simply that those at the top are over inflated. Their cultural value is grossly over estimated.  The fact that Dax would gladly switch places with those who enjoy greater influence than him invalidates his stance.   There are some artists out there making good hip hop for grown adults, who have been grinding for years with a much smaller following than the likes of Dax.  Good writers whose lines and ideas stand up to scrutiny.  There's something insincere about a grown man claiming depth for ideas designed to resonate with a teenage audience.  In some ways those that don't claim to have any real substance are perhaps more honest.
Dax !! 2021 let’s go!
Goosebumps at the hook man, this song is hard bro
Dax is amazingly great and a lyrical genius. So innovative, but I think everyone can agree that he needs to change his clapped hairstyle. PLZZ Dax change it.  Edit : Thanks for the heart Dax means a lot.
Why people saying you left man? all i see is someone looking after themselves. Do you Man, WE love it <3
“ Happiness is not a physical place you call home”  that was such a powerful line
Ay Dax I start shaking when I'm writing too! What does this mean?
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
You will think DAX works with DHL the way he be delivering these verses
I swear ure born to save this generation...
Ur nxt level
dax 🔥💯💯💯

I wonder if he likes Batman.

Keşke ingilizcem olsaydı...
Rap-Flow-Singing-Video-Moral Values Everything is 10/10🏆🥇 Congrats Sir!  🙌
One thing I like about Dax is that he took his time to read the comments of his fans. Not all but the least he react to is fantastic. #teamDax #SinceDay1
Dang fam you're a true goat... Pacs truly resonating in you.
Missed the opportunity to wax Dax's hair like the ears of Batsy's cowl          Still lit nevertheless 🔥🔥🔥
Underrated is an understatement!!! 🔥💯 Some mad respect ✊

That's what we've been needing Dax!! Keep them rolling for us my dog
Easy Bangers 👍😂❤️
It’s cool and I appreciate the work that’s been put into this. But I’m just spoilt with different schemes that hip hop has to offer and I find this to be average
Dax I appreciate you speaking real facts when other rappers are keeping us distracted with BS. You will forever be a GOAT.
Can’t wait for a next banger
I like it💕🙂
We missed u man, welcome back 🤛
Another great song. All the best from the UK x
Absolute fire with a deep message 🔥🔥🔥
Been missing U Dax 💥💥💥
Dax...... You are amazing Boss ♥️♥️♥️♥️
this song is fire 🔥
Fun fact: this can never win a Grammy
I hear you dax but I am going to make it out just wait. Hopefully I found my path out of this darkness
best artist alive
NF | Jayketz | BMike | SikWorld | Civil Society | MassOfMan | Problematic | Gremlin | Dax (spittin' real shits.) 🇵🇭
Hey dax, I really want u to collaborate with dino James...he is a rapper from india...he is just like u and his rap also motivates  much..
Just saw his story on insta and just ran here
Yesssssss🌟🌟🌟🌟😂
Dear Jax, this is Dope as F! - Jeremiah / Jerome Valesca (Gotham's Joker) 🔥
Lyrics 🎶🎵🎶  I think that we're headed down the wrong road Fakes real and they say real's fake woke False prophets on these screens everywhere we go But what did you expected when dumb people got smart phones More memes cool make it all a big joke Crown your fake kings and let them sit up on your fake thrones You're young now but just wait until you grow old When life gets real you'll remember all these words I wrote I went roaming walked multiple ways For 40 nights 40 sleeps yes multiple days In the dessert no food water searching for the answers But you listen to these people who got nothing to say You wouldn't know real if it slapped you right in the face Ain't for the culture I can tell by the shit you embrace I'm in Gotham but my minds in a different place So Fuck your co-signs, money, and your radio play I be shaking when I write my music I've been anti-violent but push me cause I just might do it They won't give you no credit cause they know you'll use it And that's the happen when the master starts fearing the student In this city you're a number they don't see you as human Just a puppet they replace for their games and amusement In a city full of angles with the biggest influence I see demons with a platform who just fucking abuse it  In Gotham...  Everybody knows everybody If you ain't got a blue check you ain't anybody Redo, repeat, sleep, double tap, see copy Lost souls unaware they're turning into dead zombies Everywhere you look is plastic all fabricated Everything you've seen on TV was exaggerated Don't nobody see you till you get a million Followers and when you do they treat you Like you're someone and you're validtated What do you do? How much money you make? Who do you know? What do you drive? Where do you stay? And while you're answering those questions They'll be calculating how much of it they can see themselves trying to come in take If you're fragile don't you even try come to this place They gon build you just to break you then rebuild you to break Let you reach your own limit then heroically save and that's exactly how Gotham turn you into a slave  In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose they're souls cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your mind in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Nobodies from here But everybody come here Wanting to be famous Till they realize the price of fame brings close everything that they once feared Consumed by the algorithm it becomes clear life's a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer Blind people leading blind people driving cars to a destination that unclear while they can't steer 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 Drugs alcohol addiction morgue Fake friends women goldigging as a sport Who convince you, you should live a whole life you can't afford Nobody sees you, you're continuously ignored Everyone wants fame they don't care what it's for They don't wanna build theirs, They're just trynna take yours This is dog eat dog in this messed up world  You think you need this place but you don't Happiness is not a physical place you call home Did you ever wonder why you feel like you feel when you take that time away from your phone Fake shit goes viral we know this won't They'll say they care but will never show Gotham isn't just a place it's a mind state Watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow  In Gotham Everyone goes and they lose they're souls cause they can't control in Gotham Everyone lies It's an eye for an eye You will lose your mind in Gotham Everyone goes and they lose their souls Cause they can't control in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham Living in Gotham  Don't tell em how you feel cause I promise they won't call back Everybodies in it for money so it's all bad Killing off my demons I'm rapping this I'm all black I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta I ain't gotta Prove nothing to Gotham They ain't done nothing for me... for me
Eh, I’ll go back to Evolution. It’s gonna be a classic
Not this specific song, but Dax reminds me of X, their both VERY involved with fans, and there music gives off a different vibe  RIP X
Great song Dax👌💥. Respect from 🇵🇱

"Life's a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer"..!

Dax literally  all your track are fire. Im not Joking bro, you are the reincarnation of Pac.
I thought this was about to be a Gotham Remix from Tokyo
I see you are  continuing to kill it with more of the truth  as always and I love them of this song and video keep it up man 👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥✊🏽👍🏽🙏🏽
It's DAX!!
Cool dope❤️🔥🔥🔥
It's DAX!
fake shit goes viral we know this wont
this guy deserves grammy
You look dope in Suit 🔝
We all know he ain't talking about Gotham
BARS!!! Really strong message as always. Much love Dax!
Like bro !)) From  Russia
Very poetic, damn i love this!!! 👏👏👏
Sup with dax with blood and scary shits!!    Song fire tho!!
This dude honestly makes decent songs.  ksi fanbois hate him because their lord says to hate him.
This is just an incredible song. Masterpiece.
Finally 😁 I have been waiting for this song the whole week ❤️
Dope🎉💛🙌👌😀
That's soooo good but this transition is soooo trash 😆 1:30
Interesting track, good message! The hook is not my thing.  You need beats man?
Damn Dax, that message is crystal clear, stay you and keep them bars coming, funny how your messages are hitting home hard in these uncertain times! #truth
GOTHAM = HOLLYWOOD. This is one of the dopest, deepest, songs that was ever made. I salute the fuck outta Dax. He's not afraid to speak the truth.
Every verse in Dax's songs is a life lesson. And I thank him for that I tell my friends to listen to him all the time
I love this song, keep up the good work
Love the song and message but honestly i thought you meant the album is called Gotham
Litt bro 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪

It's DAX ...  .... ..... ...... truth always gives goosebumps
Fire💥💥💥
If relevancy was a human.
U speak facts man always  .always..
I think the real kings in this world is the people who own these social media companies. They made these apps so addictive and we just worry about followers which we will hardly meet one day. We harldy see the condition of our parents and care too much about other people. Amazing message DAX, Love from India 🇮🇳🙏

"It's Dax"(in Dax voice)
The worst part is, he did this for the money, it's intra-critical.
It's DAX.
Everyone notices how he is saving himself, but nobody thinks about that part of himself having to climb out of ground zero after he is rescued... just a thought
Depression is real if all rappers were woke as Dax the world wouldn't be this destructive God bless yall
Dax a real nigga rockstar
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its Dax💃🏽❤🔥
"ITS DAX"

1 year 2 years 3 years 4 Drugs alcohol addiction morgue Fake friends women goldigging as a sport Who convince you, you should live a whole life you can't afford Nobody sees you, you're continuously ignored Everyone wants fame they don't care what it's for..  Dax you are a lyrical GENIUS 🔥 🔥🔥
💥💯🥇
Yea it’s all bad Dax but Inspite of everything I know that cyclone of ‘facts’  Is a big wind up for truly wacks the sacks of bags that wreak of sad. Just tryna get the bag. Infatuation with the cash cause it’s the fake love of the doves that’ll bring it all back. What back? What you or I think does or doesn’t matter because space is black.
Gotham say to Chaos "Nice to meet you"
Man the quality both musically and visually are so good 🔥.
Love the chorus
It's Not Dax
Don't be surprised if this actually becomes the next batman movie theme music 😉
this guy is a genius!! I get where he's coming from!! everyone should!!
It’s Dax!
"Quick to the daxmobile!"
you know they should call the age we live in now the age of understanding!! and if you don't get it??? You're on the wrong path!!! written by me! c.dula.

Dax  Dax Dax How many times have I called you ? I just wanna tell you the ur style of music and video is the best someone like me can imitate  And I hope someone out there is still speaking my mind, Thank you Daxxxxxx
lol @ the thought of him wearing a mask but his hair is the main identifier... dope song btw
Only artist that make u think about life
I'm glad your changing Dax :)
Hell yea
Life is a simulation all controlled by a puppeteer.. This rhythm is hot than all mamble rapers with no rhythm in there Rhymes..
Oh Dax. You never fail to amaze me with your words. Thank you for bringing the about people identities in society and where it led to. I am forever grateful for your songs and the creativity in this video is top notch. I love it  Continue the Grind Dax !!!
Dax need islam in has life😌
the song is dope🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💢💯
I feel like Dax is like Pac, he tells a story that means something and that we can relate to. Whereas these other rappers are talking bout money, drugs and b****es and nobody listens to the lyrics, they just peep the beat. But Dax tells it they way it is and if somebody don't like the way it sounds then too bad. *Not everybody raps for fame and money, some do it to tell people a story*
How badly do you want to be famous? Seems like Dax tryna be da Black M&M in da Rap. DA BLACK SANTA, BB, ALL BEFORE DAT IS DA FAX>. lol my bad bro. shit was dope. and RN YOU MY BEST HOPE. LES GO LESS GO DAX! Don't be like that dude that kicks back and drinks a 6 pack. Thas me and shits whack ahaha BUT FACTS BITCH ITS DAX!
Dacks is backs..😁👍
https://youtu.be/uDkAZCc7rsk

Dope🔥🔥
Wow Dax Wow!
Dax that weird kid in school that everyone tries to be friends with even though he's weird. Half of the people, it's because they have kind of a respect/appreciation for him. The other half are plain scared of him
1st. year, you get hit. 2nd. you get hit. 3rd. you duck the blow. 4th. you punch back. I don't know if it's just me or, does this represent what it's like when you come to Gotham? The city turns you into someone else.
The track is dope.......... Video's always on point luv u man..... From Zimbabwea here
This many people are against Islam  👇🏿
Dig this!

Bro I am a Psych Major and for years I’ve been saying this. Woman feel they need to has a big A$$ and a good set of T$$ to be woman and men feel that they need a fancy car and a big D$&@ to be a man. But this is not true, social media has given a false perception in life. Your video is amazing and well said...
🔥🔥🔥
I think it would be nice if this song is featured in the upcoming "The Batman" movie.

Been thinkin' about you baby...You're like Tosh, he was a fire man. When God wants to burn your demons away it's a trial by fire. If you hold onto the world your angels turn into demons and hold you down. Everything will be okay at the end...we love you...I don't know you...but I know you. ♫♪ ♥
Dax is the best (by a proud daxian)

Wow, I usually hate rap (particularly from popular rap artists or mainstream rap), but I've been subscribed since I found "Dear God" in the trending page of YouTube when I was first surprised by how hard this music hits and how complex and philosophical/actually meaningful the lyrics were. And now I'm shocked once again and grateful to see rap being used the way it was always meant to be used.
Those lyrics.. 💥💥 DAX you the man !💪💪💪💪💪
He's Bax 🔥🔥
after having had some serious operations and lying in a coma for 3 months, I wanted to do something in music to express my pain and show people that nothing is impossible to do whatever your goals are make it impossible possible I am now 11 years in music have seen and done a lot and I still give my whole heart to share my feelings with the public at first I could not talk, not see, but everything came back with a miracle and I can speak to the public and give a message my goal is to help and support people to do what they want and not have to give up only hard work will get you where you want to be. hard work will be rewarded sooner or later keep focus and never give up One love Rydstyle
Getting ready for that KSI fight I see😂🔥

This gave me chills
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥As always Dax
Yaaasssss great story in each of your 🎵 🎶 🎵.  For real inspiration
Say something dax. Here from your live stream on insta. Keep it up man.
Love the message in this song. To me I’m not much of a social media guy, I tend to not care about being famous. I just hope that one day social media won’t control our lives and make us like zombies. We’re all beautiful in our own ways and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Have a wonderful day everyone!
Love it. Your music is so original. Missed you.
🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🔥🔥🔥🇿🇦
I love your work Dax stay real f*** social media
Dope as always 😍💯 Happy to see you back brother 🤙❤️
This is a hard hitting message. All you internet worshippers, please go live on Venus, we don’t want you here. Some of us are waiting for Jesus Christ to come back.
Great job dax I’m super excited for the next part for dear god and book of revelations keep it up 💯
God bless you, bro.

This was so sick, and notice how he had to save himself 🔥🔥 great message dax
🔥🔥🔥
Wow
Great music not even feel worthy to comment on such a masterpiece
You forgot to say “It’s DAX!”
Thanks for that beautiful video!🙏
Ayyy yo Dax is the most underrated rapper in the game and that’s fax 💯❗️❗️
Go'Damn
Unrealll🔥🔥 it’s good that your back god bless🙏🙏
The realest song iv ever heard in my life..dax the best underground rapper of all time. Dont care what people say your more creative than eminem and people say they cant compare you to him but there blinded by the truth. Your my favoriet rapper of all time so thankyou❤❤i love you dax please keep making music #wearethelabel #ITSDAX
What happened to the All Night Long video?
You snap on everything, bro! Please keep feeding us, we’re hungry!!
Just listen this for the 1000 time. Dax inspiration is out of this world. Mumble rappers will be taking down notes in silence.  The flow is dope.
Dang this is fire
INCREDIBLE
He backkkkkkk 🔥 💯
Is it me or does Dax’s hair look like a mop
man 🤠i am wordless
Song good but video look kinda retarded😂
ITS DAX
I'm in Gotham but, my mind is in different place🔥🔥🔥🔥😮
🔥🔥🔥🔥
When this song ended all I could say was wow. Been following you for a long time dax, and this song is on another level. Can’t wait to see where you go!
That's DAX!!🔥🔥🔥💯 Hell Mutha Fuggin yeah FAM!!! WOW the video is top notch as well! Bravo 👏 👏 👏
Dax I admire how fire your music can be, while at the same time you spit straight facts, and relay an actually good message, not that many people in the industry can do both without being called cringe, when logic and rus do it, they get hate, when j Cole does it, he gets praised, but idk Im not into his shit, when u do it it’s fuckin legendary
anyone else pause and read the newspaper at the end?
dax , wanna confess something .......ur words are sooo relatable that i listen to u everyday ......and i startee to listen to u cuz of emiway bantai love from india ..peace out keep growing
This is how you know this song is very serious, cause he didn't say "IT'S DAX!" He didn't say it in Joker and that song was bout Cyberbullying, and this song is bout the consequences of bein famous.
Welcome man🔥
Dam this hit hard
good song bro
Yo much love dax don't worry about what the hater say homie u got lots of real people around u I'm glad ur back bro
Song is great. 👍🏾 giving more of that batman theme. I love the song joker.  You should be on the sound track for the new batman.  Next you should do something with the Riddler. I know you will have so much to say.  Keep up the great work.
Good job Dax this is sick
Cadê os BR ouvindo esse som foda pra krl!!!
Dax you play a good Batman

This song speaks levels man glad u back king 🔥
Dax I really think you just need more exposure i found you a week ago and your top 5 easily I couldn't believe I've never heard of you before. My favorite parts in the videos are  "IT'S DAX!".
Gotham the place where illusion turn up to be a reality for the zombie that live there! Don't change dax! We really need this conscious music and you are definitely on point every time you drop one! Much love and respect to an incredible artist!
You fking killed it dax❤️❤️

Dax killed it again
Fake shit goes viral but this Won't Felt that!
FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dax is so talented. He’s so underrated and fans aren’t loyal to him which is sad. All his videos have meanings and the verified on insta part and the “how much money you make” scene is just amazing
This fire, dax you put so much emotion into your songs, I like every song, future legend 🔥
This man talking some real sh*t. The world we live in today. I appreciate this song so much because it has alot of meaning to it. And u realize how he making hints about the music industry. People want fame but don't know the price of it.
i clicked on this expecting a cool little batman song. but this turned out as a fucking banger with really deep lyrics, u earned a new fan bro
Yo dax be speakin facts....ascension is upon us...everybody is waking up from thee american DREAM!!! great time to be alive! If you dig this check out this song I made....oh yeah, I am... Also a woke  artist who raps and sings.... not enough $ for mix and masters, but, none the less dope https://youtu.be/qFtbh7xcLBI ....if you dig that this is also a must listen, https://youtu.be/YNqsv0Spjzk it is time to heal the world People!
First we got joker...now we get Gotham   I wonder what’s next 🤔🤔 Could be a batman related album

Heeeeeee’s baaaack 🔥

Dax be killin it with the visuals lately🔥
Well i mean how i look at the song it really shows fame and money is fun to have but this world is so corrupted that this power is abused and people are consumed by everday technology and other celebrities lifestyles that we dont acknowledge our own this song dax is incredibly inspiring to me and this really shows that we need to wake up and see the world for what it really is not stand around and watch it all go to waist
Hell yeah Dax first you do the joker 💣💣💣💣 now you become Batman 💣💣💣💣✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼 can't wait for a new album keep up the amazing work

Pure GOLD!
I wonder who the guy in the mask is...
Unnervingly relevant. :)
I’m guessing dax loves the DC universe more than the marvel universe 😂😂🤷🏽‍♂️
When we masked on they masked off fake news propaganda all are mascots.
God damn 🔥🔥🔥
Very few in the game are as real as Dax
Another fire song added to my playlist 🔥

today is my birthday and it just got better it would be best if dax would reply to this
Idk who said dax is back he never left he just took a break 💯
Such a great song love it to listen to your lyrics because i always think about life if i read them. You have so much potential and your lyirxs are better than from everyone in the music business. Dont know why you dont have that much viewer like a drake but thats what I love. You do music because you do what you love. It feels like you dont care about the money you just want to let us watch life from an other perspective and it works! Even if you will never read this Im such a great fan of you I listen to your songs already a really long time and I hope I will be able to listen to new ones for a really long time aswell💪🏻
The only words that come out of his mouth is facts
early gang ??
Wow 🔥🔥🔥 this is deep....... i replayed this about 3 times 🔥🔥🔥 This is why i filled the blanks as 'The Best Rapper Alive'  on whack ass rappers 2🔥🔥🔥
The thing about life is, you never know when one misstep can lead your life astray.
Dax tells a story on the next level really inspiring
This vibe is so Kick-Ass! 🔥🔥🔥
🤘badurmakhi 🔥🔥🔥   🙌
🔥🔥🔥🔥
DAX HIT IT RIGHT ON 🎯 WITH THIS ONE I KNO HE BOUT TO STEP ON ALOTTA TOES WITH THIS ONE!

Love u man
These songs gotta be added to the new Batman games, either as ending or opening credits, or at the very least in one of the mission cutscenes; maybe a set piece.  Next song in this line up, I would assume it would be called: Batman.  Joker, Gotham, Batman.  Makes sense to me.  Songs are fire though 🔥 🔥 🔥.
Make more songs like this its inspirational
Dax you spit only facts ... Anyway it's DAX!!!!
Dax video team is insane keep killing
Damn good work this one Dax glad ur back n still killin it keep speaking the truth brother the world needs it

See who's back  Me: Dax🔥
Good shit 🔥
The message was fucking good, but the video could of been better and the title! Also the hook wasn’t it. The message was great but could of put it together a bit better. And the worst part was that Batman suit shit had me weak lol 😂
Title supposed to be *reality 2020
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👀
So happy your back, missed you man. All love ✊❤

Dax u a goat been lisen to u forever and f anybody hating on u
I've been looking for a rapper that's spits only facts but dax hit different
Ran from torey lmao
This dude speaks on some real shit. Much respect from Canada 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Nice song, Dwight Howard
"In a city full of angels with the biggest influence I see demons with a platform who just fucking abuse it." ay I'm fucking with this Dax! 🤝
One thing I want to tell you is to keep doing what you do and become more amazing and better. Don’t listen to people, who tell you that you’re worthless because in this world you only know what is your worth. Focus on what you want to do and take that path just start that beautiful journey and you will see a new version of yourself at the end of that beautiful journey. You are amazing, you are important, you are special, you are unique, you are precious, you are loved. In case no one has told you lately, you are amazing, strong, brave, wonderful, kind, loved, worthy, and there is no one like you. The world needs you❤️💯🔥
I hope one day i can meet him....he sings to my soul🙇🏾‍♀️
Damn, I needed this
Ohh I like this beat.
Such a great video totally worth the wait love all the music and working you out in every song
Welcome back Dax! We missed you and your message 💯. Very very good track. Message was brilliant and real life. Pure🔥. This is a message that I feel majority of people has to hear as it's something a lot of people feel
Dax comin back with sum heat❗‼️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dax returns!!!
DAX IS BACK BABY LETS FUCKING GO
Es tan bueno lpm
Now this is what i looking for
Where you been dax ?
Why gone so long?? 🤔
This has to be the single most relevant song of today. I feel this message needs to sink into a lot of lost souls around this world. Every one seems to have so many false idols that they've forgotten what it means to even follow. be genuine. Love is the light that transcends past hate. You my friend have a gift. when i hear your music i feel 2 pacs soul reincarnated. You must continue your path my friend god speaks through you. mental disease is apparent in most celebrities but not many have the courage to admit let alone break it down to the masses and make people realize just how much we relate. money divides all. I admire you dax. bring gotham down.
check out scottatomic.net
This is so DOPE! Also first black batman...

This song was created by a woke ass guy. I love how you correlated and put everything exactly where it should be. Lyrical legend in the making.
Never clicked faster
It's all about saving yourself in the end.
Dax went easy on ‘em this time. Hard, but easy. This track has a different kind of clarity to it though. Almost like a sermon lol. We hear you Dax!
DAX is a legend😎😎🔥🔥💯
Dann Dax i can feel this song you're absolutely truthful and right
Beast unleashed! Dax is back!
I LOVE IT! THANK YOU FOR THE AMAZING PHILOSOPHY
dax is back 🔥🔥🔥🔥 song
YO DAX... I know I’m a nobody giving this suggestion but I think u and Kid Laroi could whip up some amazing heat together..
Nice
The King is back! Man his lyrics have so much meaning. This mainstream crap isn’t real rap, Dax is.
KSI might have more fans/followers but music wise Dax beats him 100%
My opinion stands. Singing Dax is the best Dax I know.. oh yeah and he’s a top 10 rapper in my favorites list... crazy ...
les goo
This song is fire!

"What did you expect when dumb people have smart phones?" Is one of the best and most relevant lines EVER. The sad truth of today's world and let's be honest, people are stupid.

Dax🔥🔥
Yasssss straight facts, pay attention to what’s real and focus on yourself!
I actually hope I never become famous if I could be rich but also unknown as I am now than that would be nice
I logged back in just to say this is the Dax we loved this is the Dax that stays on repeat. I honestly was worried you we're switching up its good to see who we all started following before the blow up.
That when Robin got kidnapped and died and became red hood nice one man I wish u made a spiderman one but this is mad🔥🔥
So much love from me and mine to you D, keep it up brother
Much love fam
Top 4k comment hell yea
Ayo DAX hmu G I’m a new rapper I’m trynna come up, I been hearing this since day one and I’m trynna come up on god. This music is good cuz you focus on your words.
dam dax always been good but he's stepped it up a level in a different way ..i got shivers listening to this   doppee bro
I'm here for this
Wow your voice is love
Happy you’re back Dax. I’m glad that there are still some rappers out there who aren’t fake.
Other bad ass song from Dax got love the open mind rapper like Tom Macdonald Dax got have mind now days
Damn it I still just want fame, if you say I won’t like it then show me.
He’s Bax!!! 🔥🔥🔥
This is real. Appreciate the song! Needed something true!
i am big KSI fan and usually hate this mans music but I'll be honest it is very decent 👏👏
Greetings from Estonia 🇪🇪    Only truth he speaks! Never forget THAT. He’s growing tree. Roots he’s speech  You better step back And watch him seek. *YOU MINDLESS CREEP*  Love you all,but don’t trust 🖤
Good shit!!! Great video and even deeper meaning.
This nigga is present 2pac.... The rylics the voice man ......  ...... Big up bro ✊ ✊ ✊
🔥 Legend Is Back 🔥
Yo my boi dax got heat
This song is straight 🔥🔥🔥 I loved the whole production of the video too. (Heads up I'm about to go down a rabbit hole) Wouldn't be interesting if in this world Bruce Wayne has a twin brother who is an artist dax, but we know from the Joker music video that dax is the joker, so it all connects and this was a set up for Batman. Maybe I'm looking to far into this, but even if I'm going too far it would be cool if dax continues the Gotham story line through future videos. Much love man
Dax I miss you man! I needed this😔
Favorite artists ❤
Damn son🔥🔥🔥
How do I break the cycle?
Your back
Love it!!!
It's so cool. The video is literally Dax trying to save himself. It's symbolic of the fact that these last months DAX has been trying to save himself from all the demons he faced and spoke of in Killshot.
This is fire
nothing but truth
He's back
Man i need another feat with hopsin specifically with this DAX
Well done👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 TECH DEM BRO!!  🗣🗣🗣🗣
Holy sh*t Man thats sick congratulations from Poland Man love u.
Too OP Damn!
You couldnt have had a better come back than this. this is so much better than everything cuz We can feel the realness more than ever
Coincidence
Dax is a real superhero  Cuz i was in a tough depression in the last few months and all what i did is listening to Dax and wishing everyday is my last day  But Thanks to Dax he made me feel better  Thank you SIR!!! ❤❤❤❤
lets go its filled like 2 years
So this was Gotham. The whole Instagram thing. Man, you made it out of Gotham🙏🏻
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dax for Prime Minister
I must say this song is an eye opener . Love it Dax 🙏
Guess who's back..... IT'S DAX
Welcome back Dax howve you been?

Theres some artist that have talent and give it their all. My list isnt long but Dax is in it and this rapper "Cryptic Wisdom" as well. Both are very artistic.
Love from India
My first dax song I really say and listened to. Talk about lyricism. Dude is like young hurkulise, dudes a lyric God and don't know the extent
Dax snapped on this one.....100% truth and heavy bars
I was in the love G
Bro nice song for your arrival 🤩🦅
you inspiration,,i like you brother
missed you dax for these 2 months (dhilo aayo kada aayo)
Was waiting for this for so long maan🔥🔥🔥
the lyrics 😧💚
They the same. Versatile your music Dax. Lighten up the aggression or like a lighter voice. Maybe change the theme a bit too, *you have the potential to become big.*
Straight fire🔥
Good👍🏼
Hes back and better than ever!!!🔥🔥🔥
Dax  G.O.A.T💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn
the chorus is good
Make this trend🔥🔥
Yeahhh buddy, its DAX!! ❤🙏

Thank you Dax!!! The world needs to know your talent and the message you are trying to put out
Scene
DAX IS BACK WITHE A NOTHER BANGER 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Yooooooo as always, fire music!🔥
hey dax i would say you dropped this👑 but you already have it 🔥

💪💪✊👊
Dead ass, is Gotham the circle of social media?
What would you expect when dumb people, got smartphone.
i got chills throughout this entire song. Dax I hear you.
💊
2:12 Who got 8 mile vibes?
Fame isn't for everyone. Great lyrics and imagery. Another master piece. Anyone wants fame, it's just understanding the work you have to put into it. It doesn't come easy and sometimes it's just dumb luck.
How badly do I want to be famous ? It means the world to me I’m trying everything I want to be looked at as someone who’s a content creator but I know I’ll never make it anywhere because it’s all dreams people will never believe in me but it’s ok
not just gotham my dude.
Wow😭🔥
Again another fire song!!!
Celebrity just wanna clout and to be famous Dax so proud that you gave us the word BE YOURSELF 🔥🔥
Impact🖤💜🤍
Hope this is in the new Batman movie🔥
Dax been grinding
OMFG there’s so many damn bars and in the video is a message to. Dax you deserve everything.
Nice hope u have a nice day and be safe
This is deep🔥💙
🔥
Dax describing perfectly this generation 💯
I don't want to be famous. I just want to give my kids a great life
Great track sir. I definitely appreciate the message
I watched joker before this
Felt this. I don’t think I’d wanna be famous. I just wanna live.
Damn the production quality really went up
Welcome back I miss you dax
Man you r such a real gotham
"They gon build you to break you then rebuild you to break" Damn that hit hard
The song hits.
fucking lit man
DAX YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLE PERSON, I VALUE EVERY JOB YOU DO, I VALUE YOUR STRENGTH TO MOVE FORWARD, YOUR MUSIC SAVED ME AND MY PARENTS LOVE YOU BECAUSE THANKS TO YOU YOUR SON IS ALIVE, KEEP AHEAD, I'M PROUD OF YOU

My respect for this man. He one of the only people to go against social media through rap and exposes the fakes
💯💯💯👏👏👏
This is Dax Brasil 🤘
This song is just amazing
One year two years three years four drugs, alcohol, addiction morgue. Being a recovering heroin addict I felt that line.
He's backkk!  I love you and I feel this ♥️ you are amazing and you need to hear it because I don't think you hear it enough😘
Well said
Yo you’re the one that made me play basketball the song is fire🔥🔥
Idk how I feel about him using Batman and Joker, kinda felt like batman and joker has been over used, but the stuff he is saying is pretty real and not just using those characters, so big respect for just using it as an analogy to our real world
And people say Dax can’t make hooks smh
so sic!
1/544
This lit💥💥
Another fire song by Dax. Keep it up dawg
Here he goes again!! Masterpiece bro, well done.
We need to get up to number 1 on trending
🔥🔥🔥🎤
You don't even get it dax. I blessed jesus the day I handed him the master sword.  Because technically were all retained in the present in some manner. The devil was and is God's right hand man before and after jesus entered this world. They are both middle men of god
Like if Dax is better than KSI
My soul..
Went from joker to batman real quick and still fire

Man good message!!! It showes how  impotent numbers are in todays society. Its really sad, that people wanna take pics with ya without knowing who the fuck you are, just because of your followers or the other benefits (there are many) you get when you are a hyped/known person. Sad story of our live. Good work dax 🔥🔥🔥

dax will always be spitting fax in everysong
This song is why I only write music in my garage and don't record anything ever. I just want to make music I don't want the fame... The world will never hear me    :/
He basically broke down why I dont wanna be famous or known. Sure having a lot of money would be great but if i cant dissapear with it then i dont want the ball and chain of what fame and money brings.
Something makes me think that the music video has something to do with Batman 🤔
Missed you bro! Where ya been at? Hope it was all good and you had some you time. You deserve it
1:15 just a god can write this vers 😔😔😢
glad to see you back, 1 mill before saturday

I don't like people asking my specs upon meeting, I linger into topical conversations to avoid being turned into a numerical graph and ideology of success timeline.
Ima use this song for my boxing career music, before I enter the ring
Welcome Back Dax ❤
I love the message but Idk about the theme and the hook tbh everything else is heat.
Fiancée: Can you turn down the music, please? Me: It’s DAAAAAAAAAAXXXXXXXXXX

"I been shaking when I write my lyrics" Me too Dax, me too.
Uff Dax u so a perfect rapper holy shit thats so fucking nice
How badly? I don't cuz once I get that ill never be same and I wont allow myself changing like that.
Always fire bro! @dax
I bet DAX could break out of them chains if he really felt like it
ITS DAX!
Dax is crazzzyyyy
What do you expect when dumb people got smart phones... damn....
The only one that can save us in Gotham is ourselves
Biggest fan dax is the goat
Here before 1 mil👋
social distanesing?
To answer your question “how badly do you want to be famous”  I don’t really want to be famous I just want to make an impact on everyday life, be remembered for doing something if that makes sense. I also know I’m a few years late on this answer to the “dying to live or living to die” question, but I’m dying to live. Putting myself out there with all this hate is hard it’s people like you that help me see the light. I know that it sounds really cheesy but it’s very true  If you see this you’re an amazing artist and nobody’s hate can or should ever make you stop, you got this man
See it's weird because Dax is a clearly better rapper than KSI but KSI  makes well better music. So if dax actually made bangers and party songs he'd alpha YouTube
I'm always waiting for his next video.  This guy never disapoints
Its Dax🔥🖤
Wow , what a deep song , every sentence hit hard , it's like a bowl of truth that people need to hear and think about . Dax saved himself from the demons , left Gotham , this dark place , got back in power and turned the page ... I hope you're finally free bro , as physically as either mentally , wish you all luck and love in your life ! Excited to see what's next !
The King is back
Hope u do more songs like this...I'm a big fan of yours dax...dax is back
Aye Dax, thank you for givin me inspiration for my music
It's to deep even Mariana's trench doesn't even compare
ITS DAX
I never wanted to be famous... I always felt like there was too much sacrifice behind it. But I did always want the "key" to happiness and success. Great song.
Dax always 🔥🔥🔥
People say dax is back, but. He was never gone.
Only hits no misses🔥🔥
Dax never disappoints..go check his previous videos❤️
It's DAX
This song truly hits home for me. I just got kicked out onto the streets, out of my own deceased grandfather's house by and evil man who knows I can't defend myself legally so he somehow got me evicted during the pandemic in 5 days... Couldn't defend myself at all. Thank you so much for taking a break to remain on point and for touching on the subject, dax... It makes me feel like someone somewhere knows how it is... And just because I'm homeless, out in the cold with my pregnant dog, doesn't falter my value as a human being... ☮️
That's my man🔥🔥🔥🔥
Another amazing song! Keep up the amazing work and the grind! Love ya man! Best artist there is
DAX DOESNT MISS
This is fax 💯
Its always its Dax But not Hows Dax
New Episode ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

I’m so glad dax is back with more lyrical epicness 🔥 can’t wait to hear more
Nice one daxs🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg Yessss!!!! WOOH GO DAXXX
That first question, How badly do you want to be famous, I’ve asked myself that. I wrote a song about that and I really want to write music but idk if I have the longevity to keep it up day after day. When I write though I’m writing about real life stuff that most people don’t wanna talk about. But sometimes I get that voice in my head that asks if I really want this or tells me I am not that good. Idk. I just hope someone reads this and can relate.  Ps This song is deeper than the surface appears it to be.
My powers out from hurricane zeta and I got 31% battery left on my phone and this was worth

Je suis français je kiffe Dax ❤️
The wait is finally over!!!!
🔥🔥🔥
Welcome back Dax like you I'm glad I don't live in Gotham fuck that shit bro. Great video and lyrics that touch the heartstrings. Now this should be No1 but most people who live in Gotham buy boring pop songs and can't hear the good stuff if their noses were rubbed in it. Looking good Dax as always keep the faith. Lol & Kisses from Denise. 😍👌🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
Joker? Gotham? Starting to sense a theme.
This is FIRE keep it up Daz!!!
Now this song...is real. Can't imagine being in someones shoes like this tho, always trying to figure out who's there for you, not what you got. Keep on going dax 🙏
🔥🔥
Hell yeah Dax IS BACKKKKKK
Gotham isn't a 'place.' At least not in the figure of speech Dax is using it. It's a 'mindset' that everyone is in. And it was the mindset he is in (and possibly still is, due to his recent stories and posts hinting that he isn't "ready" just yet). It's the era of where everyone is captivated by the same old shit. Where no one pays attention to the, as Dax put it in Killshot 2, "the shit people need that'll actually make a motherfucking difference." Where people are powerless. The things people say and do to get clout and fame. Whether it be famous in school, popular in town, or the next level.
this shit is deeper then rap no cap he speaking real shit
vaery nice progress
I dont really listen to dax, BUT GOD DAMN SON, WHERE U BE GOING WIT DEEZ BARS
Hes back baby🔥🔥🔥
Hits hard
The lesson is, only you can save yourself from the crumbling pedestal of whatever situation you're in.
Still killing it,brother
My daughter loves your music
This makes up for the batman movie getting canceled
Wtf is this bro but not bad 🔥🔥🔥
Wow!👀👏👏👏👏🌟🔥 this does not disappoint in any way & was definately worth the wait. Truth bombs galore in there!.  As for fame? Keep it! No thanks. I would rather have quiet acknowledgement from those who matter with a simple 'thank you good job👍' than fleeting fake empty adoration then dropped like a hot spud soon as the next shiny new thing comes along. As for the money? Thank you but no thank you. I will earn my own through my own graft until im comfortable & i have enough to take care of me & mine. Dont need anymore then that.
this song is straight heat, and needs to be heard by tons, but it won’t go viral 🤷🏽‍♂️and we all know why
Why is no one talking about the fact that technology divided human kind? Strong words, respect.
Dayummmmm everybody dropping shit today, keep it up Dax 🤘🇺🇸🤘🇺🇸
we got ksi thinking he's a god and we god dax thinking he's a superhero ... can you 2 just fucking make up and drop a collab allready ffs!?
Lexnour w another dope beat🔥🔥
Did this dope a** track really have to end🔥🔥...Dumb people got smartphones Know everybody felt that...  DAX RETURNS WITH FACTS
One of the best songs I love it
Mans got barsssssss🔥🔥🔥
Claim your "Here before 1 million views ticket" right here. YOU DONT MISS DAX!!!! <3
Crazy How Accurate This Is.... #SocialProgramming
Such a brilliant song.
Damn Dax, I feel like I felt what that one was deeply about...  deep Hollywood and Music Industries... dont fall into that shit... dont let them ever control your content or message... when they tell you what you can and can't say, you will no longer be an artist... just a puppet.
Fire
IT'S DAX the LIVING LEGEND is back♥️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤️🔥 your lyrics are full of passion and soul, speaking truth to the hearts of the people who need to hear them. Well done DAX xx💋❤️🇦🇺
Thanks dax,you surprised me with this conceptual music video. I have to watch it more to understand more.I know you have just passed some tough moments but I'm asking you continue what you're doing (I mean real music) my favorite dax.👋🏿👋🏿🤲🏿
Dax this is fire 🔥🌋
Speak the truth that half of you can’t even hear
Message is awesome, but video is terrible.

"they gon build you just to break you then rebuild you to break".... Felt that🤧
If fax was a rapper "it's dax!!!!"
Daxxxxxx, bro I’ve been listening to you ever since I’ve been listening to you
Dax Ur lyrics are tremendous. Pears me anytime you spit the truth.  Anybody who believe Dax will be a good movie actor should drop a like down 👇
🦉
Dax is the goat🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sonreal
FAKE SHIT GOES VIRAL!!!!!!💯💯💯
Sick man felt everything greets from Croatia
We need more crazy music videos like this
FerraTorr DAX🔥🔥💯🎧💪❤🙏
Real music
Good to have you back dax🔥🔥🔥

I'm short of words because my mind won't cooperate with heart so after hearing this song am feeling guilty of almost every line i heard and my problem now is get out of my Gotham i think my mind needs Gotham 2 way out and I hope you deliver that but as for now am just gonna continue fighting this depression in my heart ❤️ love you dax
holy shit this fire asf 🔥🔥 so glad dax is back
We got Joker.... we got Gotham....  Now we gotta wait for Justice League.
Gotham isn't a fantasy it's real life
This hits differently!🤒
u got the title for dizzy eight
Next song is gonna be called batman 100%, its gonna be about people being fake and putting on a mask while there famous.
0:05 me looking in the mirror staring at my first strand of underarm hair
Woah 💯💯
Spitting facts as always king Dax
Our society is Gotham. . .damn
Damn.🔥
ITS DAX, THE JANITOR (Great song and video)
🔥🔥🔥🔥
yh this is really one greet inspiration song from#Dax,i'm a fan from nigeria
Look na, Dax, you have me crying and I can't explain it properly but thank you for this.
amazing my brother, this is really good
IT'S DAX!🔥
waited long enough for this🔥🔥
My Goodness, the wait was worth it. Big up to Dax for this killer track. This is dope dogg 🔥💯👌🏾❤️👍🏾
Welcome back home Dax
I forgot he was a janitor
Heard like 7 times already.  "Blind people leading blind people,driving cars to destination that is unclear while they can steer"  Waaayyy to underrated
Comeback 👍🏿👊🏿
This is a really good song to come back! Your videos are getting better and better. Glad to see you back Dax. We still follow you even if you fail or blow up.
Yo finally
Dax é um gênio
I don't want to be famous, I just want to be a respected rapper and a person who his friends and family can count on. Nothing more
REAL MUSIC. THATS HOW GOD CREATED DAX
Dax in costume of hero was just 👌🏻
Dax = Blessed. Let he who is different bring change to a world filled with indifference, ignorance, and prideful people who will do evil. Words can bring forth change,  as the bible has done again and again.
How can you talk about people using you for fame when you tried to get people to pay huge amounts for features including rappers bigger than you? Bit hypocritical
Fire video keep it up king 👑
i needed to hear this and i do not regret it
Dax never disappoints 💥
Here before 1mil views
OMG
Welcome back Dax !!!!
I think I speak for everyone when I say this was worth the wait
Yo man keep spitting that real shit!
"1 Year, 2 Years. 3 Years, 4 Drugs, Alcohol, Addiction, Morgue"  Goddamn....
This needs to blow up but it probably wont its sad
He went a minute solid without beats🔥🔥🔥
Man is that old Greg? 0:22
If u wanna hate me go ahead but it needs to be said. Lyrically Dax is fire but I've lost some respect for him after this one.
Thanks for being back!! Your songs are just amazing. Every single word, the rhythm, the messages, all perfect connected!! You're amazing!!!!
Only thing I got to say is UNDERRATED
Not bad, man Not bad art all 😎❤️

Welcome back and thank you DAX
It's Dax

Yessir

We need more rappers like you, the ones that have actual meaning behind bars, not just some gibberish. Always 🔥🔥🔥 Dax!
"Fake shit goes viral, this wont"..... Damn!
Dax should release a studio album.
BIG FAN DAX

DAX IS BACK. THIS IS 🔥 🔥
What a goat 🐐🔥
Not a Dax fan honesly. This bangs though. This hits me hard too.
ITS DAX
A banger like always but same time I was highly let down for the wait and this to be it
stg I was wondering where Dax went since Broken seconds before seeing he released this
Hey everyone, I bring to you what a blackhole looks like. This video and music can't get any deeper!!!!
Batman dax when he saved dax “i like ya cut g”
This shi so hard💯🔥🔥
I love when you put so much meaning behind a song🤝🙌

The boss is back! 🔥
Man that's was amazing keep up 👆
Ok ok ok, Dax got me with this one, when he starts speaking truth, like his song to God, he actually snaps. 🔥🔥

"Fake shit goes viral// But this wont". 🔥🔥🔥🌟🌟🌟
Yoo dax is back please make more masterpiece like this and i love your music my heart hurts dude keep doing what you doing man
Cant wait until this hits spotify. It's going on the playlist instantly
My favorite detail I'm this is that there more than 1 joker, like in the Show Gotham, or in the batman comics
I like how you used Gotham as a reference to social media, there's really deep meaning here🤧
Ayeeeeee was waiting for this
This is so good bro 😊 I love you bro you the best
My boy is back 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Really Good Lyrics👍💪✌
From Algeria 🤘✌
fire wtf
He’s right🔥. Tell me I’m wrong, some y’all rather on hate 6ix9ine and worry about  Tory Lanez and Megan. When them problems in Nigeria is goin rn. Or how kids are going missing, many being sex trafficked, 200 went missing in northern Ohio alone. I appreciate you Dax. The real ones are always seen as “cheesy” or “boring”.🤦🏽‍♂️
I love you DAX
I'm thinking less Bruce Wayne and more Luke Fox.
"FAX" have to be changed to "DAX" ..if yall know what I mean. He just speaks the truth.
just the validated line!!! bruh....Dax your the real deal bro, fuck other rappers
Fax is probably one of the greatest artist I've ever heard 🤷‍♂️  EXTREMELY underrated.
King is back 😌🖤❌💪🏿
ITS DAXX
Another prophecy
Hell yeah IT’S DAX
did anyone else think that Dax was going through some deep shit? Man I was really worried about reading his Instagram and Snapchat stories but all he was doing was prepping us for a bob about the reality of the 20th century
man knows how to spit good quotes
Yessir
Perfect timing before bed🔥🔥🔥
Good ahead dax talk the truth I feel you on this song... All the songs you came out with I feel some of the pain you are talking about I come a low life style and I'm trying to make it better myself love you bro
I can't forgive my self for watching this https://youtu.be/E3oEHf-9emw again and again
Good job! Real feelings always better than hearing fake.. 10/10
I can't forgive my self for watching this https://youtu.be/E3oEHf-9emw again and again
Didn’t wear the mask cause the hair?
I can't forgive my self for watching this https://youtu.be/E3oEHf-9emw again and again
hello muaaz
I can't forgive my self for watching this https://youtu.be/E3oEHf-9emw again and again
Everyone knows that vector zsasz carrys two pistols everywhere he goes lmao have you even seen gotham?
That chorus man... you just proved again how much talent you have let alone the lyrical content. You have been evolving so much as an artist yet you keep the same values and the same truths are being spoken. Bravo man big hope and wish that all of your efforts to share your vision will be paid off one day!
Nice brooo
This is real if I've ever seen real
I just got to the point I like dax shit without having to watch it. But I watch it anyway
This is FIRE period
Fire
I connected so hard with this song This is 🔥
I really want KSI to react to dis!!!!!!!
Dax's back and he kicks some ass. That's what we call hip hop
Dax completely out does himself Every. Single. Time. 👌🏼🙏🏼🔥
There is a reason why Dax is the person I follow on spotify. no on else on his level
Great song man and I understand what you're saying 👍 thanks this helps

Glad dax is back been needing this fire for a while 🔥
This is a work of art, fucking beautiful🖤❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow 😳 what a come back this hit me HARD

Keep the fire coming. Don't feel like you're in a rush to crank it out. Keep putting your passion and heart in it. Those who try to make a difference do better because success follows. Forcing success never works.
DAX you are awesome!
It's dax💯💯🌹❤️🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
🔥
So many views, likes and comments. Dax has the best fanbase
🔥 *FINALLY LET’S GOO* 🔥
I am famous. In my mind
Omg Dax😳🔥 what a way to return to the scene. Dax speaks so many facts and it’s so real that it hurts bc we can see the problems with the world.
Wowwww this giving me chills
Gothаm isn’t just а plаce it’s а mind stаte Wаtered by the thoughts thаt mаnifest whаt you grow <3
This is my favorite song, this is why I don't want to get famous, we gotta change this world bro. These demons A.k.a. fallen Angels, need to be stopped hell is here. People like you and me, need to bring heaven here! This is my favorite song right now, I wish hopsin would've stayed on this path to. Keep it up, don't ever quit right now the matrix is breaking. So now, is the time to overthrow these demons! Keep awakening the masses, the bar that hit the hardest was "They say bein fake's real, and real is fake woke!" One day we will hope on a track together, just hear in your music. And watching you mannerism. I can tell you care, proud of you! 🙌🏻🙏🏻❤🙌🏻
So so good!! 🔥🔥🔥👍🏼
This guy never disappoint
🔥🔥🔥🔥 Dax is back

I hope people could learn to separate the art from the artirst, I honestly believe Dax it’s a good person but people need to understand that people make mistakes. It’s not right to condemn people for their past. Dax this is a banger brother and it impacted me.

This was great! Glad you uploaded this now the world needed it!  Plus this is random but I like how you tie dc or specifically Batman into your music almost had a metaphor or something (I know what a metaphor is but I can’t think of the word)
Dax is Back with Bigger Ones 🙏

Nice song dax

So worth the wait, I'm glad you took the time and put out exactly what you wanted.
👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥When on Spotify ? 🔥
"Gotham isn't just a place it's a mindset watered by the thoughts that manifest what you grow."  These lyrics right here!!! We all fall prey to the spell of social media and instafame. We get entranced and lose ourselves within the dark corners of envy and self hatred. Life is so much better outside of Gotham!
Gotham🌆🦇
The people who dislike this are the fake people dax be talking about
DAX hooks never fail to disappoint
Damn I didn't really like the recent songs you made but this one jeezz it was fire keep going man
Beautiful work Daniel, i don’t want to be famous, I want to change the world and be everyone’s support that they need.

Glad to hear this 🙏 and welcome back 😊

Great song and music video🔥🔥
Thee Era of@thatsdax
Man this is insane thanks dawg✊🏿✊🏿
Here we go again ♥ LEGEND is back, really good job again ! RESPECT :)
That blue tick scene...
Just knowing the time he spent pouring his soul into this song, and the message it sends... Sends chills down my spine. The truth being told is what many are afraid to say and hear.
No one is above God. Fasting is something Jesus did and along the way the devil came when Jesus was in his weakest and tempted him to show his power. You got this Daniel. I don’t love as a rapper but as a human being with flaws.🖤
IT'S DAX!! ♥
Came right back because I forgot to like the video, can't let the man down. Great Song!
word of the day is F.I.R.E
dax the truth
Hell yeah another great song!
Fire my guy you outdid yourself and the message is a real one about the fakeness of social media which we all know too well. 👏🏾💪🏾🔥
I don’t wanna be famous I jus wanna feed my family and sadly I gotta be “famous” to do that
Ulan fenasın dax . Crazyyyyyyy

HOW DOES A MAN WRITE A WHOLE SONG DROPPING BARS IN EVERY LINE AND SPEAKING THE TRUTH AT THE SAME TIME. LONG LIVE DAX.
Dax is one of the best artists out due to the topics he speaks on, messages he carries with all his songs, the effort he puts into his music, and he still finds time to reply to fans on Instagram and everything.

DAX IS BACK !!! WE MISS U
I would hate to be famous and I would hate to be recognised by hundreds of people it would only lead to me getting harassed by those journalists and such  Celebrities are people too. NEVER forget that!

Beautiful story and well said 💯 glad to have you back

Banger!! Get Dax into the big industry he can speak lyric to lyric with the “BIG” ones
wahh
Fire as always dax. Love everything you've ever put out bro
🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯
I feel bad for Dax. Gotham may have been created on the basis of fiction, but in Dax's mind it's been there since day 1.
Is this the Snyder Cut?
This song has a similar feel to confessions of a millionaire by Lacrae. None the less it speaks the truth, people will sell their soul for fame and that is truly sad.
Bro this shit slaps keep up the good work your already great just keep improving yourself!!!
LIT ✌️🔥
Ok! Buddy
Honestly I wish posted all the time
Such a good fkin' song, such a good fkin' music video  Welcome back Dax! 🔥
Dax you left me speechless this was a masterpiece 💯 #Gotham
IT'S DAXMAN😎

Welcome back Dax great song hope everything goes well for you🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Dax saves Dax😂
When he can finally afford a shirt, he gets kidnapped...  Poor Dax.
So in love with the themes of music lately..... and all the meaning associated with them
Eh yo check out my Tyler Herro remix it’s 🔥🔥 don’t sleep on me I’m a rising rapper over 1k views 🔥🔥🤙🤙
yes you have comed back! keep grinding fam
I dont need fame, with fame comes fake friends and envious people thats after your life or love ones, im not going to put my true friends and family members for random people and money, im happy to just be a normal person living life day by day making my own money  Edit: welcome back dax, glad to have you
Happiness isn’t a place he’s so right. Your mind controls your reality you can either be in Gotham or paradise just depends how you look at life
Wow I have no words other than wow and that shit was amazing
Been waiting on yuu bro, now I feel like a person... damn king, yuu killed it!   #SouthAfrica❤🙏🎯🔥🔥🔥

That message was great! As someone who reads comics, the parallels you make to the real world in both Gotham and Joker resonate and make you think. One of the worst cities in fiction and one of the craziest characters make the most since when compared to our day to day lives.
This man Dax is the best lyricist 🔥✨🔥💯
Dax my man I think you should have a collabo with NF
dax the legnd
eh dont really care for fame just wanna be financially stable doing what i love doing then again i would want some fame to help inspire others to invest in what they need to do whatever they want in this world

Low-key dax needs to stop trying to make such an impact people too stupid in 2020 to notice this man's
“ fake shit goes viral and we know this won’t”   Its crazy that what everybody needs to hear won’t go viral but all of the stupid stuff that people don’t need to hear goes viral
He had fun making this. Even though this is a really serious song.

Dax always inspires me alot  Got mad love for him
I don't know why everyone hates on Dax... his voice, confidence, bars, delivery, and beats are ALWAYS on point. Keep it coming brother. You're killing the game
Wow just wow lyrical genius you amaze me every time bro keep it up
youtube is revived ....... thx @Dax
My hands are shaking and I haven't even clicked play yet 😭😭🔥
This one really hit different!
Dax is back 🔥🔥
Damn. This is just straight facts. Look man, if u make this good shit every time u take a break, take as many breaks as u need. To me, that break looks like it was worth it. Speaking of which, how was your break? Was it worth it? Are you feeling better now?
So true
He’s back
That is deep. Not only the lyrics talk about the dark corners of life and human nature in a beautiful (melodically speaking) way, the vid is great. U can sense that DAX rlly felt what he said with this song in real life.  It’s a work of art.   I’m glad u back DAX, the industry’s different  without u. This IS gonna go viral.  Love from Spain
Absolutely amazing! This SURPASSED all my expectations! Literally every sentence cuts you deep, you are a lyrical genius!  I uploaded my reaction to this video, here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfVG_aR3P1g
YOOO YOU FINNA BE BACK? Damn i fking missed u bro!💚🤘
This is a master piece
I listen it after 15 min
Welcome bk it was worth the wait my guy was fire 🔥
Some of the bars in this song hit different, like the blue check, man that is tru stuff in this society, imma child but I still look up to Dax and what he speaks on, everyone laughs at me for listening to him, but they jus don’t have that mindset
At 3:00 is that guy supposed to be victor zass?

Dax is back boys🐐 this song hit hard, no one cares about you unless u got money or a blue check mark😒
The best 💜
ITS DAX!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Absurdo
Dax this is a banger like usual
It's Dax! Coming back with truth and fire! Good to see you back!
It's DAX
Straight fire. Shine a light on the leftist movement rioting and sinning.
Dax is whats been what is and whats coming
They coming for Dax for speaking the truth cuz they want you to be programmed 👎🏾 keep it up Dax🔥💯
That’s DEEP.
much love man
When I heard the title of the song GOTHAM, I knew it was from the DC Universe it’s just that I didn’t know how Dax would connect it. And this man just connected him, and parts of the DC Universe on one whole song.... this man needs a god damn raise. And Eminem where the hell are you look at the stuff that this man has been making, Dax you’re the Michelangelo of rap.... LITERALLY. I hope you, your family, your friends, and colleagues are doing well in the world we live in right now. God bless you. 🙏
welcome back
Man's both Batman and Joker, two sides on the same coin
Coo I like your style
i like this nice job
God Damn Dax. You my man did it again. Everything you write and sing if fire. Mad respect. This one is by far one of my favorites now. The flow, the best, even the chorus is catchy. Well played Dax. All love, keep it up.
Great song Dax! Everybody wanna be famous in Gotham
Omg, i don't want to be famous again believe me🙄 Hey Dax you should know that Since you are still rapping the rap still alive, you are next to the biggest rappers in the world, Eminem, Royce, Kendrick, Jay, biggie, pac and the others so i don't want to see you or anybody of them retired🤩🤩 stay you man
Life's getting darker . Losing my mind to all the Chaos in the world
🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤
Damn..🔥
GOTHAM is a also metaphor for Hollywood, right? Amazing and truthful song. Loved it 🔥❤
Im glad you're back
Great song ! 🙌
LETS GOOOO!!!!!  Dax is amazing!!!!!
Amazing singer for real
The king is back
Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I knew this was going to be some good shit. I needed this.
I want to meet Dax in Real life and become Friends with him. He says, what my mindset is like
Hallelujah Dax... That's all I can say... You're a True Prophet.. You're deep ... You're Mad...( making a difference) Preach to me bro... Your sis from Nigeria... A song to #endsars
The only slave is me to this song!!🔥🔥🔥
Damn..
Yoooo this was worth the wait 🔥
Finally he is back at it again but even harder
Dax your one of the best rappers today you are one of the pieces keeping rap music good
AYYYYYY WELCOME BACK
Make a song saying some thing japanese, i think it would be a banger.
🔥 *"They gonna build you just to break you then rebuild you to break, let you reach your own limit then heroically save, and that's exactly how Gotham turns you into a slave"* 🔥  Dax back at it again spitting facts
Awwwww shytt here we go again
Yo that song was awesome I’ve been waiting for a song by you for a long time bro. Thanks long live DAX!
ur songs and music videos are starting to sound and look the same. you have the talking voice, the screaming voice, and the singin voice

Mate...  you and Tom Mcdonald should do a song together, 🙏👍💥✌️
Missed your music Dax! Fire song

The man who never disappoint #GOTHAM

Where did you get that awesome costume from?  eBay? Walmart? Alibaba? Target?
I really don’t understand why people still sleeping on Dax.
Fire🔥🔥🔥
I've been feeling this same way. When I started making music and videos I started realizing that every creator, celebrity, and small creator is human. Seeing someone as anything more because of popularity is disgusting. All I have is respect, which is what every celebratity should get at least. Glad to have you back Dax.
Glad your back Dax hope all is well All Love bro🖤💯
Dax for life ❤️
my rap idol is back in the game stronger than ever.
Hey people
Quick, turn on the Dax signal

Holy hell, that was deep.  The questions that are asked through the lyrics are very important ones to ask, especially today.  Dax, you came back strong and we have been waiting your return to your throne. 👌👏
A lot of heart in this one! Fire as always!
Why Dax Always gotta be going thru pain in his videos
I love this song it really speaks to me this is actually how world is like the nicki minaj and cardi b when cardi b came out everyone forgot about nicki minaj they don't care who u are  they only care about how much money I make em and that's cold
Wow I am never disappointed 😍😤 love this
Dax trying to be an artist I understand ur pain by the way artist in music
Awesome song
Sometimes I Feel Like Dax is A Reflection Of Thoughts I think About Or things I feel about🖤🖤
This song is what i needed🖤🖤
Hes BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LET'S  GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Dax, I want you to know that this made my day. I've been dealing with depression ever since my mom got cancer. She is recovering from it but it eats away at me because I couldn't do anything to help her. I have so many questions about life and Christianity, it makes me upset because I have no one who can explain any of this You are an amazing artist, I want you to have a wonderful life with no toxicity, stress, anger or hate I have nothing but love and respect for you and what you do. So whenever you feel down or sad, remember that a lot of people love you and want nothing but the best. Especially me
Wait, did Dax ditch his chain?
This is so 🔥🔥. Powerful and absolute banger!
Now tell me where’s the Joker
Wow, this is amazing, great lyric, great beat, great video, but above all great talent, Dax the real batman from gotham. The return of DAX💪💪💪
When you were making this song, I was wondering “where is Gotham?” And after hearing the song, I realized: everywhere is Gotham
You are the goat Dax  ! Thank you so much for you music ! You really help and change peoples lives ! 🙏🏼
The king has returned 🙌
Dax went from cleaning up them floors to cleaning up them streets. Dats tough!!
If you are from Europe, whish you to feel good.
Missed you, thank you for coming back with the fire! Love the truth you speak!
Jesus Christ that was some fire shit right there🔥keep it up bro🙏
Dope visuals bro🔥🔥🔥
Wow that was good!!!
Thats what I'm saying we been waiting for u to drop some heeaaat
Dax keep putting out songs like this I really feel them in my bones
Omg I’ve felt so alone but once you released this song I got really excited and now I got my motivation back from you
Dax music videos are always out of this world 🙌🙌
Broooooo ur supernatural
Damn straight wow! I appreciate this video and it's honesty.
In Gotham   Not just a place.... A mindstate🤘
Only 9 minutes late this is 🔥 🔥
Dax is back This is lit I love you Dax💓 My fav rapper
Dax man I hope u doing well nigga. Speaking fax out here. Hes smarter than most people. If u kould respond to this that would mean the world for me
Fireee🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dax is The new american rap’s face
“In a city full of angels with the biggest influence I see demons with a platform who just fucking abuse it” This line makes me think of all the trap rappers who make shitty music and get famous and then abuse everything they have. Then when you say “Don't nobody see you 'til you get a million followers and when you do they treat you like you someone and you validated”. In this day in age of society everyone wants to be popular, everyone wants a name for themselves. If you’re unpopular you get pushed to the curb and ignored. But Dax, I love the way you have silenced the haters, you have done this the right way and actually make rap with meaning. Keep it up my man can’t wait for more of your music!
Hi
Amazing dax just amazing
Always spitting more fire than any artist out
💯✔
Dax has on clothes. You better listen to what he’s saying.

Dax becoming Prince EA
Hi
On the 30/06/2020 my younger sister Olebea Sinclair (Crissana) died under tragic circumstances. She was only 28 yrs old leaving 3 kids behind. On that day when I came home and saw her life less body on the ground I started crying and from then on I never stop shedding tears. I lost apart of me and I keep praying and hoping that one day I may find the strength I need to heal the continuous pain am feeling inside daily. I have been doing music over 15 yrs so i did this tribute to her life and memories, this has been the easiest and hardest song I've ever did. Take a few minutes to watch this video and listen. Feel free to leave a comment like and share. THANK YOU!!  Produced by K.M.T/ O.N.P Distributed by hapilos21 Video @xavieproduction #cry #ripcrissana #sip #heaven   https://youtu.be/fNH2RPTPlHE
