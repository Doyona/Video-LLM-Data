He after 5 months of the most recent reply.
Here after Jeddah 2022 😆😆
i miss these front wings and tyre looks
Youtube knew what they were doing when they recommended me this 💀
I just watched the 2022 to see who's capping
Who would've know the season wouldve ended this way.... Max! You are the world champion!
I’m from the future max verstappen is world champion
Anyone here after final race?
Who's here after Max wins it all
Verstappen is World champion now!
I am back to relive this season once again. Anyone else?
Who could know what was going to happen on lap 58 in Abu Dhabi
When you're half way during the season and you come back to watch pre season testing:
Is it just me or did anyone else notice she didn’t say anything about Daniel on the Leaderboard
Redbull's reliability goes out the window with Sergio perez's car switching off on the formation of Baku 2021
Despite how much of a shock most of the rule changes are for the drivers, I genuinely think it's gonna give everyone a fighting chance. Wonder if we'll see a more scattered packing order throughout the season.
The cowardly january clasically heat because antelope disconcertingly allow in a kaput cafe. paltry, lucky scarf
SBINALLA
Mazepin is black
2:16 Carlos really inherited Vettel's car...
The prononciation of Ricciardo and Vettel are terrible!
What is going on. Huge amount of technical problems, especially gear box?!
The Williams looks 👌
So...where is the Netflix team?!
what a shame to see F1 take a political opinion by mentioning the plandemic.
Where is my boy Checo
With Hamilton on the track and Totto as team principle there unbeatable , sorry Horner ha
unlucky bottas
Barcelona: where's pre season test day 1? Barcelona they have to delay it because due to the sandstorm  Barcelona: KARMA!
4:04 what is behind the front wheels of three of the cars?
And still mercedes will have the best car when season starts
Mercedes then: WE ARE THE BEST Mercedes now: WE ARE NOT THE BEST Ferrari then: WE ARE THE WORST Ferrari now: WE MIGHT ACTUALLY SUCEED!
why the cars are not looking like in the 2021 preview presented in the end of 2020?
Nice 50fps
Petition to take off thier helmets
The Alpine looks stunning 💙
she forgot to say ricciardo in the classification  3:48
interesting
1:14 Ocon's breaks are on fire!
why the f**k did they test in desert i wonder
Typical of Mercedes to stage some fake difficulties during pre-season practice with other teams.  Lots of love from South Africa
where is my boy sergio perez !!
The alpine looks striking beautiful.😍
"My Dad Is I'll" "And I have Not Job And Money" "YouTube Doesn't Giving me Views And Subscribers" "I Want To Handle My Family" "Yah I'm Worse Than Others"😭😞,*

Gonna be an epic year!
Mükemmel
I'm more excited about not having to hear David crofts voice on these reports than anything else. I wish ESPN would beg Bob Varsha to come back......

Yeah Ferrari
Why did Williams let Nissany have an entire day?
I hope lewis looses this season
Did anyone notice that in the final leaderboard of the video, Mazepin's russian flag was missing?
ههههه
Este ano o bicho vai pegar 🏎️🏎️🏎️🇧🇷🇧🇷🏁
They could do a real test in Bcn but they went to the desert with all this sand. What do they spect?
HASS: American team with russian flag 🤣
Alpine car ❤
like wet races, we also should have sandy races every now and then for diversity , fun , unpredictable result!
looks like ferrari put again on back burner, always next year
Checos body language tells a different story. Hes not happy with the car. Althoigh hes sincere when he says we will take it step by step
it's like mercedes finally know's the whole "no tires" scam didn't work anymore
Oh!!!! Boy ❤️❤️❤️ Roar 👍👍👍
I sottotitoli in italiano 🖤
4:04 Does anyone know what the mesh grilles are behind the front wheels on a few of the cars such as the Redbull front right?
Get ready for a sensational F1 season ,L H in front with no overtaking fantastic.
I know 99% won’t care but I hope everyone stays blessed and safe during these times. I’m struggling to reach 1k 😔💔
Loving the look of the new Williams livery
Cant wait for the game
When did they stop putting engines in cars and start putting power units in?
What we learned is nothing first race will tell os what we need Ferrari didn't have a power issue but ran the car dry of fuel.. that part of testing knowing you fuel flow.
Cleaning track with vacuum cleaner
Test: Will lewis hamilton dominate this season? Lewis: Its hard to say, all driver has improve, some of them has pass my highest level.. Race day: And lewis hamilton 1st podium..!! 🤣🤣🤣😂
Da gruken sie wieder auf ihren Flughäfen herum, mit ihren ferngesteuerten Plastikbussen. Was für ein Elend.

Still dk t know whg has ( an American team) went French this yr
The Alpine is Handsome
you have to say RICCIARDO in italian please
Merc´s sandbaggin is now on another level agreed!
Are those the 2021 cars
Tja wenn es nicht mehr auf RTL läuft schau ich F1 nicht mehr seit 1996. sorry aber so langweilig wie es die letzten Jahre war zahle ich nicht auf Sky für diesen Sport.  Schade i‘m out.
This isnt F1. F1 was only until 2010. This is some other weird motorsport. Those machines dont even look like f1 cars.
can we just say     that racing point looks FRESH
何かフェラーリが速そうに見えない…
red bull will excel this season!
Gearbox problems by Schumacher means more rounds for Mazepin. coincidence?? I don‘t think so
would be great to watch this again, but well with no sky and in the uk (the blooming home of F1!) its just not worth signing up to sky only for this
Freue mich formel 1 auf RTL anzuschauen. Ooo Moment da war doch was 😭
The Narrator Voice makes me feel i‘m Hitman
hope that Ferrari will back Leader
1:34 "Help, I'm stuck stepmechanic"
Mercedes is already celebrating the 2021 Constructor Championship behind that black curtain.
I hope nefix is back as well !
Looking forward to seeing Sainz in thr Fezza
This is gonna be the most decisive season 🤩😜😁
Do I understand that Haas were only a second faster than Mercedes when Mercedes had an aero rake installed (all BOTs laps)?
Everything I know about F1 (which is VERY little) is from Netflix's documentary. Really looking forward to new season about last year.
3:49 u forgot Ricciardo

Que bueno que la formula 1 esta de vuelta, es la segunda temporada para mi. Saludos Desde Panamá.
Is there any Indian Car ?🤔🤔
I'm rooting for Esteban Ocon, he's doing well!
Let’s see how many subscribers I can get from this comment.    Currently on: 224
Let's go, Aston! Glad to see Mercedes 'struggle.' Ferrari need to get it together.
I saw this on my TV and I'm from India true
Everyone will do Aston Martin career in F1 2021
Ferrari - Red, Black , Green and White 🤔.
I'm loving the new look of the Ferrari....
HAAS Painting looks so trash... literally every car has a nice design now, primary color + secondary color most of the time... and then Russia HAAS lul
ISNT "nikita" a girls name? same for "yuki"  when are we getting real girl drivers in F1?

This season looks a bit evened out... a bit
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4
And the WINNER IS HAMILTON
The  fresh soy lamentably cover because glockenspiel additionally bury underneath a awesome waterfall. naughty, cagey joke

really excited for this season with all the seat changes! can't wait!
Max Verstappen is Champion
What song is this!? I can’t Shazam it for long enough before the voice over starts
Alpeeeen?
Seems a shame to start the season testing all these wonderful new engines in a sandstorm?
Another year, probably a new set of rules to make the season even less interesting than the last couple.
That cara is fast and all but do you really think I could beat usain bolt.... like cmon
I have 1 question. What is "T" tyre in Aston Martin? (3:47)
Hondo logo on red bull's rear wing looks sick.
No day 2 highlights?
f1ｔｅｓｔｉｎｇ2021
Mercs sandbagging again
Nobody Cares About Testing... Its gonna be a single file line behind MERC
Top
Hamilton will school them again
I feel sorry for Bottas. He needs someone to give him a lucky charm.
And alonso ?
i thought they couldn't hide the car? is that just a rule for racing?
An eager young genius - Max.
"the American team haas"
Alpeen lol
Come on max it's your time to win.
The Alfa might be the prettiest F1 car in years
I am SO disappointed that the background music wasn't darude sandstorm....
GAWD,CAN YOU AT LEAST UPLOAD SOME FREE RACES
Jaaa richtig gut

Mercedes is the real deal! Until Q3 nothing is sure.

Why did leclerc have to crash but a power unit nooooooooo!!!!!!!
Just a friendly reminder that McLaren with the new V6 era in 2014 topped all practice sessions.. and we know how that ended :p
Norris up on 2nd!
russia and america working together in a team what could go wrong?
F1 2021 is here, but she still can't pronounce Leclerc's name correctly.
Vettel: left. S🅱️inalla: stayed.
"It was a shock to see Mercedes 'struggle'." This is winter testing, they always pretend to struggle
“Ferrari hoping a new power unit will bring them better success” 5 seconds later “Leclerc was running ok until a power unit problem”
The Script A Mafia Story! Read The New Novel... It's A Movie For Your Mind.
2:07 thats why he's the SMOOOTH OPERATORRRR  2:12 S🅱️INALLA Stays At Ferrari
Why does anyone wear a mask when they are outside in the sun ? Get over it, it's a flu!
Carlos Sainz was smooth though lol
Mercedes is literally sandbagging. They even summoned a freakin' sandstorm.
ahhh, now im sure carlos has vettel's car 2:10
So hyped!!!
I’m excited to see what McLaren will do with the new power unit this year
FINALLY SUBTITLES. THX.
1:33 what happened to teams not being allowed to screen off their garages during testing?
Ferrari painted the back of the car darker so its harder to spot the burning oil
We miss Hulkenberg
Hopefully next year F1 preseason can return to Barcelona Circuit. These conditions are not in F1 level.
hey at least no missile strikes. guess that's a win?
Ferrari: Mission Whatnow?
F1 2021!!!!
where is the great great checo
Glad to be here for the new formula 1 2021. Let's go Lewis, let's go mercedez.
Fingers crossed the Mercedes team is fifth or 6th fastest team this season
Cool Jaguar are back
Looks promising for a exciting year, hope it will be closer at the top, im going for 7 different winners this year....
Todas equipes tão de parabéns pela pintura de seus carros estão incrivelmente bonitos e imponentes; mas na minha opinião a Alpine, a Aston Martin, a Mercedes e a Alpha Tauri estão mais bonitos.
way to go lando, eayes on you my man eyes on you
lol Mercedes doing their usual we're not showing our pace until race weekend then
Dortmund - Haas
Still hard to believe that Aston Martin is racing in f1
Please say sky will replace Crofty this year!!
This that same woman whose voice is in pre takeoff safety instruction video?
Weren’t the 2021 cars supposed to have larger rims?
Darude has arrived
Commentary is awful. An epic effort to drive 129 laps in an F1 car by an overpaid driver? Do me a favour; you mean chance of a lifetime, maybe!
I love that Aston Martin. Auf geht's Vettel! Zeigs ihnen.
Sad to see pre-season testing coverage still cares about times too much
The rarest tests ever
Where is Checo?
Race
Wait when is the racr
Red Bull and McLaren seem to be strong. Mercedes really struggling.
Go McLaren ❤️🏁
No one: this commentator  Alpeeeen
Sandbox is open
When will be the next prix
I usually hope for rain on a sunday, now I'm hoping for a sandstorm
I have a nagging feeling Yuki will be rookie of the year
Lol american team
world sport: Russia, you cant use national flag in the international tournaments  Mazepin older: Ok...
really look forward to see how yuki does
Warum gibts keinen  deutschen  Kommentar?????
Cannot see the numbers on the Mercedes probably you cannot tell who’s who.
Mercedes' sandbags got burst
Maaaaaax! Let's go Bulls! Alpine looks like a Toothpaste livery.
Alpeeeeen? I thought it was Alpine (As in PINE TREES) oh well.
Willians está jogando no modo my team
Looks like Ferrari continues where they stopped... but this season I'll absolutely not care bc Vettel got a new Team:D
I like the colors of the Alpine and Aston Martin's!
Whats the "T" tires? I guess "Test" ?
Hey. What about Checo???
2:36 Great video but small mistake here. I believe you meant 'the Russian team'
The disparity among F1 teams is as big as the economic disparity in the world! It's time that the powers that be make F1 more even and competitive.
Alpeen
Kimi!!
“The American team...” 😂😂😂
Where is Alonso?
WE NEED 4K Video !!!!!!!!

I don’t like sand, it’s course, rough and it gets everywhere
Mid March and still haven’t started the season lol
3:54 Mazepin is race for the peace😂
In testing: "OH NO MERCEDES ARE STRUGGLING GUYS" In actual races: "Oh wait nvm they are still fastest lol"
Max Verstappen gonna be 2021 world champion. You heard it here first.
Mercedes Hat alle geflickt. Die Farbe ist eine Schande. Scheiße❗
Ferrari will be nowhere...  but can red bull win a championship this year? 🤔🤔🤔
i bet the cars are spitting glass out the exhaust there's so much sand there.
Can’t wait to see these rookies in the race especially Yuki.
Forza Ferrari❗
This season the cars are beautiful.
Love how F1 showing bias towards the arvo session. Pretty sure the McLaren is going to be challenging the top 3 this year
Mercedes 😴👎👎👎👎  I hop Mercedes lost everything in this season.....
Classic Mission SpinnoW  LOL super LOL Hope Vettel best future with Aston Martin
Haas american team................Yeah nah.
Now THAT looks like a Williams. Its a bit sharp edged but wow. In natural light its got the vibe. That white and blue with yellow and black. Watch out HAAS 😎
Otro campeonato para Lewis!!!
Chiliz to the Moon 🚀💫💫
U can tell that the mercs definitely didn’t go all out
Why does mazepin not have a flag?
No Perez?
👍👍
Hey guys, where can i watch f1? Im from germany and sky owns all the rights here so its not free anymore. I'm willing to pay, just not 17€ a month. Any advice?
Alpine livery in the evenings looks stellar!
WHERE DO YOU WATCH THE TESTING
"The American team" Russian flag approaching out of sandstorm
The only way I wouldnt mind mercedes being on top is with Bottas, lets all send our thoughts to Gods of racing to switch that curse from him to Hamilton.
is it alpin or al- pine?
Never thought Alpine would have the best livery out there. Hoping it performs great this season
Smooth operatioooon to sbin preparatiooon
Unlucky Bottas... Nice start of new season for Sacrificial lamb.
Go Seb!!
I see Mercedes threw their excess sandbags on the track this year
A sandstorm. Bahrain is a waste of time for test days.
3:52 - Why wouldn't you take Riccardo's name in the top 10?
"2021's 3rd Rookie Yooki"
2:11 S🅱️inalla
Has to be last season for kimi
Que payasos que son con las caras tapadas por dio...
"Carlos Sainz afternoon was SMOOTTHHhhHH tho" nice one F1. caught that.
pretty crazy that people actually call pierre a specialist
遂に角田がF1参戦か 今年活躍して早くレッドブルとかに移って欲しいなー
Mercedes are the guy who says he failed a test then gets full marks
Two and half GP distances in a single day is actually crazy
Ciao Formula 1 pensavo fossi inglese. Be meno male e se puoi qualche video fallo in italiano
“Ferrari hoping a new power unit will bring them better success”  Me: InshaAllah
Just me or does Williams look like a my team career mode?
What is the tyre “T” used by stroll?
Alpine blue is amazing
That camber on the Red Bull though
It was a shock to see Mercedes struggle in the preseason? Nah
Hope everyone is having a blessed day. Funny and entertaining content, check it out guys🔥💫🔥
1:14 😍
No one can call lando overrated, 2nd fastest and 1.3 seconds quicker than Ricciardo
I'm ordering my next car in British racing Green. STUNNING !
Finally A interesting pre season
Amazing.
Alphine🇨🇵🏳🚩🏳
The music should have been Darude - Sandstorm
Nissany the Isreali-French is a reserve driver of Williams-Mercedes.
I wouldn't put too much stock in it yet, teams have been known to fox on test days.
"Unlucky bottas"
I really like the Williams livery. The boring white became very outdated.
I have this strange feeling that Mazepin's car will be very reliable this year.      Schumacher will have DNF after DNF after DNF mark my words.
FINALLYYYYY
Didn’t Honda leave?
Red Bull is not a car manufacturer why are they in F1? What's next, Coca-Cola?
1:34 They shooting a movie for ⬛🟧
I can’t unsee the Alpine engine cover .
2:06 I see what you did there 😎
Ferrari built tractor again
2:11 from smooth operator to "HONESTLY" sooner or later.
Alpeen lol
This season will be really really exciting ...and we are gonna witness a change of guard methinks
Max is a beast!
what is (T) Tyre ?
Why none is talking about the 1.12 of kimi raikkonen?
With Haas the American team, SLAPS GIANT RUSSIAN FLAG on car
In 14 hours 1 million wiews you are fantastic Formula 1
2:30 "Alexa, play Russian anthem."
"It was a shock to see reigning champions Mercedes struggle." Toto boi : *excited sneaky noises
The Voice is soooo relaxing
...and still no engines in the cars..😩..skipping this season also in wait for real V10's to come back again...
What does Hamilton think of human rights/womens rights and modern day slavery over there?  Thought he was going to fight against all this? Or he only mouth off his gob in the UK? Bahrain's record on human rights has been described by Human Rights Watch as "dismal".  Torture and forced disappearances are common in Bahrain.
Vaccinated F1 ppl wearing masks - what a hypocrisy
F1 BACK LESS GOOOO!
Well, too bad I can't watch F1 in Germany, as F1 TV Pro is not available anymore and I don't want to pay Sky much more money than F1 TV Pro used to cost, for a service that I'm not happy with. Thanks F1, thanks a lot, great idea you had.
Why is Mazepin's flag white? XD
Looks like Vettel carried on but the s🅱️in is here to stay
2:11 HE DID THE THING
MAX MAX MAX SUPERMAX track plays in my head seeing this
Seriously why is mazepin still here
Ferrari is in 5th place and in 5th it will stay. They never sandbagged, furthermore i don’t expect great things from a team made out of people who ruined Seb’s carreer
...then saturday sunday WHAT! 🧡
It’s not about times, it’s all about Data.
neow
2:13 A spinning Ferrari  Right after that cuts to Vettel   We see what you did there..
Mercedes having fun seeing how easy this season will be
2:45 rookie Yuki
This season is gonna be the best one so far
Is that Ferrari looks bad as last year....?looks like they falling down 1.2 sec off the pace to redbull it's very big..
Verstappen is on a mission.
So it starts again
knowing mercedis they are sandbaging like a champ again
So my take, merc are sandbagging and will do for the entire season to make it look like a close title fight as all everyone saying is its all about the car and nothing about Lewis. Then it will be a he's the GOAT he won his 8th title in a tough fight with max.
Lando 🎉
Lance helmet looks like he is the car
There's a spinning Ferrari!
That Williams livery is actually looking much better out on track. Have a feeling that will be a grower for a lot of fans.
alonso?
I've heard the term 'sandbagging' being used for the tactics used by some teams in theses test sessions but this is ridiculous :p
Red bull are next champs
referring to haas as an american team is a bit of a stretch these days
Cannot wait for the F1 to start again !!
3:48 Ricciardo: "Am I a joke to you?"
I want to see Lewis, Seb, Max, and Fernando fighting it out on every last lap........I can see Seb being very fast in the green Merc this year, he deserves a great season.
Rookie Yuki 🤓
Hamilton is just waiting for that reverse card which for sure he will get it during Q3
Yuki...  He is next superstar.
@0:13 so weird seeing a yellow T-bar on Vettel’s car
Merc sandbag every year. They'll bounce back.
Kudos to Honda for sticking with it
mercedes: we will do just a few laps, we dont need more than this.  ferrari: ok guys, next year.... next year
tbh tho,ferrari doesn't really look that bad
Ещё один сезон в масочках(
literally everyone changing their fantasy f1 team rn
Everytime I see the Alpine I just say "Its so shinyyy,"
New cars, new season... Finally F1 is back. I'm so excited
FINALLY
Mercedes : sandbags where are my sandbags
What about Perez ?
1.12 lets go
So happy f1 is back
"2021's third rookie Yuki"😄
Bottas is unlucky already.. even before the races
Hello Diana , this is 47 ...
Bottas has already started his lack of luck superpower.
les go
Where's fernando alonso?
yeah the American team with Russian livery   never thought gonna see this day
I can't listen to this woman. She's not infoming me, she's trying to express something else and I'm not sure what it is
Loving the colours on the cars this year.
Red bull lijkt sneller dan mercedes
These guys are in brand new cars, driving on a Sandy track but still are faster than me on F1 2020 😂
Mercedes Sandbagging is making the sandstorm question his ability to hold back sand
What’s an F1 car’s air filter like? I imagine that sand can’t be healthy for any engine equipped with a minimal, race-style filter.
Merc: key to success is creating struggle during first test. Ferrari: wait, we try but not success
anyone else noticing how they are not showing the haas from the side? XD
ew.  Even Haas' team wear is the Russian flag.
Sandkhir
when f1 held in mars
Carlos is looking strong with the ferrari we dont want another bad season
Where is Alonso???
Mercedes' got new steering wheel.
Ferarri: we got a new power unit! Leclerc: well, im having issues.......6th it is!!!
S🅱️inalla
mercedes brought some extra sandbags this time around, so they just scattered the leftovers into the wind.
Sand is  there because all the sandbags that Merc took with them
That Aston looks absolutely gorgeous ripping around the track
I really wish they made the Aston Martin more green, the livery could have been much better
Sainz carrying vettel's sbin lol
anyone knows the name of the female commentator in this video? What’s her name ? is she genie gow or Mercedes media presenter  Plz reply what’s her name?
very long not see f1
Looks like they've updated the weather conditions in the new patch and added 1 more mode
Is F1 harder than Nascar?🙌
Another bye for Ferrari
Mercedes struggling in testing is the same as that boy in school who says he's not really done much studying for the test but then ends up scoring more than the entire classroom.
Alarn tanda bahaya tim Mercedes menyala, kerusakan gear box bisa jadi masalah serius buat balapan musim 2021
The Alpine kinda thicc
Mercedes are just sandbagging
Lol "the unlucky Bottas" 3:59. Bit harsh?
That alpine blue is growing on me
Those sparks on the bull tho....👀
F1 IS BACK BABY
Sickth. It sounds like you put someone else's mouth in to read.
Going to have to remember to say "Alpine are" as opposed to "Alpine is".  Mercedes foxing, as always.
Thankio x the Subtitulos in Españon ok.
Looks like merc 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
Stroll really has talent. Nobody can't deny that
Everybody thinks Mercedes is sandbagging just like they thought Ferrari was last year at testing.
Thank you, Formula 1!
皮肉にもレッドブルがチャンピオン取ったらホンダ風当たり強そう。 まぁ、無いと思うけど。
Sainz spins...he really did get Seb's car.
Checo?
Mercedes has too much sandbag that cover the circuit
Why the russian flag doesn't appear by Mazepin?
Nissany quicker than Mazepin on the same tyre
That alpine blue 😍
Where's Checo?
Nice to see alpine and Aston martin officially in F1
I’m willing to bet 100 grand mercedes wins again this year
2:15 the S🅱️INNALA continues
The Williams looks great irl
Nice to see the Alpine name on a race car
WRC class F1
no more smooth operator, now is s🅱in operator.
Woooooohooooooo
I think guy who's carrying the brief case probably reached Bahrain. You know the dude from the sandstorm
Mazepin faster than MSC
Mercedes flexing with 10th place
Is team William or blue shark on road.. livery with blue gill stripes makes the car solid comeback.. hope the team performance s well this year..
Mercedes are in trouble this time
FINALLY
Stroll that dkhead
All of those liveries look better now that I've seen them on track.
2021...This is a beginning year of Max Vestapin becoming a world champion onwards...
Operation desert storm start!!!
Merc is playing the long game its time for merc big plan
Again a sand storm during race.
3:49 those sector 1 and sector 3 looks like arms of a skinny person trying to pose...
I live in Bahrain and day 1 of testing isn’t going to give maximum results due to the weather there was strong wind and it was dusty
!?!? GREEN !!??? signs that Ferrari are really losing it
formula 1 please try to bring per-season testing broadcasting to India. I really wanted to see it live.
This will probably be the most exciting hybrid F1 season so far. From a driving perspective, not car perspective.
Red bull IS POWER FULL
Seb sbinnala ➡️ Sainz sbinnala.
2:13 S🅱️inalla
Disappointed to not see Canada in the schedule again this year..
4:02 i get the issues the FIA had with Haas's russian looking livery, but did they really just remove the flag from Mazepin's leaderboard times? lol
Man I miss Perez 😢
Mercedes must be testing their slowest setting just in case they have any issue during the race
I'm not getting fooled by the Mercedes this year. They are still the fastest.
3:20 Williams' livery is the most underrated on the grid.
2009 Pre-season tesing day with sandstorm: am i a joke to you
I’m so excited
Let me remind the haters: This is day 1. This is called testing. Learn and enjoy. Don't hate.
Man I love that Williams livery.
Man!!! That Alpine Blue and Aston Martin Racing Green! Lovely colors.
max versta🅱️🅱️en
3:57 It’s Nissany Mazepin Schumacher Not Nissany Schumacher Mazepin
"American team" *Has a russian flag painted on the side*
Bahrain "specialist" Pierre Gasly.... right...
I like this. I really do hope the grid looks similar to the standings from today, something new and fresh
Best looking cars this 2021:  1) aston 2) alpine 3) haas
Why did you skip Danny Ric from the list!??
What about the Yoke ?
Everybody sandbagging... Ferrari: Atleast we don't have to sandbag!  (Titanic sad meme music on background)
3rd rookie Yuki
ALONSO MISSING
Why are you guys making only making 4min reviews...short on content ?
Como se dice en inglés: "Mercedes lo llaman el zorro astuto"😈
Nice having Mercedes without competition for the 7th time...thanks for postponing the new rules
Why do all the idiots in formula 1 media call them AL-PEEN? They are Alpine. Rhymes with fine, or wine, or pine. Fawks sake
Is the narration done by Claire Williams?
I thought honda is done with F1
May be F1 have to add caption at starting saying "Voice of" . Narration have been fabulous over years for practice in YouTube that they deserve recognition for it
"Unlucky Bottas;" it appears Bottas luck hasn't changed a bit from last season.
AT front part looks like a merc
Okay so where are the Stroll Haters now? He got a decent lap time at P4.....
Mercedes: this is part of our masterPlan, just let them ahead of us at the start and then make them suffer throughtout the season
Can't wait to see that Alonso kid, I hear he's gonna be a great rookie this year.
Ill get it out of the way for all of us: Congratulations on the title win Ham and MERC.
The FOV of onboard cameras make the cars look slow. F1, please fix it.
That Alpine livery is sweet with the matter finish. The Ferrari looks dumb with that little weird pop of green on an otherwise beautiful red car.
Shoe again
Come on Alpine!!
Wait so its pronounced Al-peen, not Al-pine??
A lot of the colors are looking pretty similar
Gracias por los subtítulos en Español!
2020: S🅱️INNALA 2021: S🅱️AINZ
What does t tyre mean
Let’s go Landooo
McLaren can possibly challenge Mercedes this year
That sandstorm is craz, imagine how slippery and dusty
just 3 days testing, terrific
Does anyone know what background music is playing
What is the T tires
2:40 I Say no to Mazepin.
IF ME I THINK YOU NEED 10 MINUTE HIGLISGH  EACH DRIVER CAN GET 1 MINUTE ++ CAUSE THAT TIME HE NEED TO COMPLETE ONE LAP  SO WE CAN SEE EACH DRIVER DO 1 LAP OF HER BEST
Observando a Aston Martin o que essa nova equipe pode fazer
Fórmula one 2021  👍
3 days of testing for cars with parts that are meant to last half the season is a joke. No wonder the grid is so spread out the past few years
Ricciardo is a slowpoke, might be the drag of his massive nose
The woman narrator is annoying.
2:12 thats the first spin carlos... many more will surely come
Yeass Mercedes is going 📉📉
In 2020 Ferrari had a terrible PU but their reliability was a complete turnaround from 2019 (Bahrain, Austria, Germany, US). Hopefully in 2021 they don't go back to 2019 again...
Sand storm for engine is bad.
Stroll schooled Team mate Vettel!!
2:16 problem is ferrari not seb
It's lights out and away we go......😍😍😍
Williams F1 team be like, we pay for the test driver, then why not use him for a day of testing.
Wth Vettel was so down !!!!!
Seriously? You can't compare morning session times to afternoon session times.  Ricciardo was fastest in the morning session... and didn't drive in the afternoon session.
Darude sandstorm
Gracias por los subtítulooooos ❤️
so from the commentary on the leader board Ricciardo musn't have come 7th.
Redbull looks so much better having the Honda logo there. Shame its their last season together though
Whos Vettel lol
"it was a shock to see reigning champions mercedes struggle"
I hope the Russian car (HAAS) does as terribly as they always have. Russia is a horrible country and I hope they fail.
Merecedes have overdone their sandbagging that it broke and caused darude to start running
💎This is going to be the best Season ever.... no need for 2022 regs to close the field... but all these new liveries too?...dont lie... BLEW YOUR MIND MIND BLOWN... WOOOOoooo P.S cant wait for day 2 Review!!!
Merc stay keep their rage mode... Until qualifying.. And the Merc on p 1 n p2
What kind of bs track conditions are these? All that sand haha
Wondering why no one is talking about Carlos's spin...
Rookie yuki
The Williams is absolutely gorgeous. By far the most beautiful car
Why is preseason testing not on most broadcasting
WTF1: Sandstorm chewck now where's the snow.
Alonso?
That Japanese kid will surprise people this year.  He will be focused.
How can I watch f1 pre season testing for FREE??
2021 cars ♥
Man that Aston looks amazing.
Merc is not struggeling they are playing as in al past years!
Should have broken it up into sessions. Doesn’t mean much when it was much cooler in the second sesh
Sbinnala time baby!!
All cars had sand in them, so technically everyone was sand bagging
Até que enfim legendas em português
Aston Martin, Alpine, and Williams looking nnniiicceeee.
Anyone got any tips on where to watch this year's f1 with English commendary here in Germany let me know. I don't wanna pay Sky.
Mercedes: It's a prank!
where is russel?
No footage of Ric in a McLaren??
Super excited for this season! Can’t wait for it to start
The only American thing about Haas is the the name.
3:48 Dan Ric be like : Aw, here we go again
*Carlos in Ferrari* Binotto: S🅱️innala
Mercedes under performs during testing, and then goes on to win rhe championship...
Aston car is beautiful!
at 4:00, there shows Seb's tyre is T, can anyone explain what does this tyre type mean?
that alpine is beautiful at night :O
No grip on that track.
Lance to seb: u can borrow it for a little while ,you scratch it you pay for it 💰
Haas has started sandbagging Micks car already nice
What a smart idea to test in the desert 🏜👌!
i can't unsee the russian flag on the haas
bro we sleeping on alpha tauri
Merc prb got a dump truck full of sand in that car.
Wait it's al-pin?  I thought its al-pine 😅
Pirelli is going to have to make some “sand” tyres pronto.
Hamilton: sand baggin’?  Toto: enough sand to match the number of AMG on the car.
I love Mercedes and always will.......      But, omygawd, the Aston Martens are so pretty!
So anakin hates bahrain then
Sainz is already complaint about Ferrari not supporting him
f1 is back
A VERDADEIRA FORMULA 1 É COM MOTOR 100% A COMBUSTÃO... V10 E V12! CHEGA DE PILOTECOS DAS MERCEDECAS ADULTERADAS... E PROTEGIDOS PELA MÁ(FIA)...
Alpin and Aston Martin look awesome on track! But Ferrari.... oh Lord... I think it looks even worse in the real world
Verstappen gonan week the first 5 races remember this comment.😎
Also wegen der m und m  werbung werde ich die  nie mehr kaufen , ist schlimmer als die vergengenheit deutschleds
Mercedes Dominant Ends?
Max for the championship lets goooo!
2:07 “smoooooth operatorrrrr”
where was checo??
Where is Perez😅😅😅😅
This video is cool and all but mazepin got placed worse by a test driver in the same compound
put Mazepin in the bin
“Carlos sainz’ debut in red was smooth though”.....I see what you did there. *SMOOOOTH OPERATORRRRRRR*
All this show off and wait for season start to hear "Get in there, Lewis"
Mercedes did not need that
Sadly yet another season using DRS
i think hamiltons tires were gone
Lando on fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yay
Hamilton’s tyres must have gone
What's the background music??
You think Mercedes has a team dedicated to finding new ways to sandbag every year, or does Toto do that himself?
Yuki the 4 Japenese F1 driver can he find his mojo to be 1 with the car and finish top 10 in debut race Williams drive with the old 1997 livery but in 2021 Version and Haas join with Russia frontwing livery
3:45  Daniel Ricciardo: Am I a joke to you
Why wasn’t preseason testing in Barcelona like it always is? Wouldn’t have had to deal with sand? FIA hello?
Yukiって表示されると女の子みたいでいいね
7
Mercedes got another loan of sand from bahrain huh
Dónde puedo ver esto en vivo?
2:11 the first sBinnala from Carlos Sainz in 2021 huahuahuhahuahua
Why do testing in the desert? Why not Italy or Germany? Or UK?
Finally
Is nobody gonna talk about Norris getting 2nd fastest lap
What happened to Perez?
Mercedes took one look at whatever one else did and went... We've seen enough, start planning the 8th straight title celebrations.
Woooo F1 highlights are back 🙌
So excited for Riccardo on mclaren!
Looked like a rally stage with all that dust
The Ferrari livery just looks awful
With all the smugness and condescension Mercedes fans are showing against all the competition, I cannot wait for the season to start.
Sainz first S🅱in for ferrari,nice
"The american team" - Laugh in Russian
Looks like f1 2020 game
Last time I checked the American flag was red, white, and blue, but I guessed they changed the colors before Haas unveiled their livery.
🏁🏎️🔥
Looks like Mercedes didn't even bother to bag their sand anymore.
What happened with Checo ?
Some tipped over Mercedes Sandbags.
Imagine having a mighty sandstorm on race day and the first race of the season ends up like Germany 2019 but with a sandstorm razzle dazzle
But the look on these cars are next level🔥
A reminder that testing doesn't indicate ultimate performance
Inscrito no canal e com sino ativado, mas não recebi notificação desse vídeo.
Wait, you guys pronounce it "Al-peen"???
Mercedes are such cheats
Mercedes purposely coding gremlins into the transmission control unit to give us hope
F1 2021 let's go
Super
Sainz had a smooth run. Totally loses control of the car.
How many sets of tyres did those doing 100+ laps go through? They certainly earnt their pay today doing that so long.
02:14 The s🅱️in still here
角田がんばれ！
4:05 I need this wallpaper in 4K!
That alpine 🤩
Although testing times are very hard to determine real pace, I feel like this report was too basic and more like a qualy report. I would have hoped they at least tried to talk to potential comparisons. I.e. morning runners vs arvo (conditions clearly changed), times on specific tires, anything more than... here are the times... Redbull are best (I do believe they look in great shape btw). But McLaren having a great time on the yellows (second in arvo session and first in morning session) wasn’t mentioned. I don’t know... maybe I am grumpy with no racing... but this report felt so vanilla 😅
Mercedes is just waiting to unleash the dragon 🐉 on the AMG looking to see it’s competitors struggle 😂🙌🏿
Why didn't Alonso participate?
Mercedes...sandbagging again...
Schumacher, Raikkonen, Alonso and Verstappen names all on the F1 grid again. So cool and Kimi has raced Jos's son and Michael's son in F1 now.
Merc sandbagging everyone... lol...
Nikita have no flags country at the table... 🤭😆
Why is Williams the only team to not run its race drivers?!! With only 3 days it's vital to maximise running. It's not like he's veteran and brings experience. Jokers.
Ah yes carlos gotta do the tradicional s🅱️in in seb vettels seat for the first time on track in 2021... also i gotta ask did redbull convince honds to stay as theyr power unit or is it someone else now?
The biggest joke is commentator calling Haas American.
I will miss the banana liveries of the Renaults... :(
Tf is “T” at Vettel & Stroll? What tyre is that supposed to mean?
Subtitles, please
Forget rain, from now on I wanna see SAND during the races.
The sand storm helped mercedes fill up those sandbags.
American team with Russian colors!
"Lewis, it's James. Increase speed and run wide at turn 8. Feign understeer and lockup at the hairpin. We are live, please confirm"
LETT'S GOOOOOO Let's Gooo!!!! Ahhaaa
JAAAAAAA
2:12 A video with Ferrari is not complete until there is a s🅱️inalla.
HONDA
Why do the Aston drivers have a T for their tyre compound?
Dear f1 media team. Like i said the last few years, testing is NOT about laptimes at all. Please stop talking about placings, its just ridiculous. The amount of laps completed is the only thing that matters
Yay, F1 is back
Merc sandbagging again
4:00 I love that shot at the end with all the cars and drivers lined up looks cool.
Mercedes car looks like last year's red bull that's why they are struggling
Rookie yukie has a nice ring to it, doesnt it?
3:45 just completely ignored ricciardo
so we have American team with Russian Title Sponsor and Russian driver.
I hope Mercedes struggles throughout the year.
Haas = Nyetmobile
Please win it, Honda
Thanks for putting spanish subtitles we apprecieate it <3!.
glad to see schumacher name in f1:)
3:49 poor Riccardo
Power to the max 🦾😎
Another mundane season with no team to challenge Mercedes.
Why didn't merc have the second car ready to go?
Let's go! This year is gonna be a blast
2:10 s🅱️inalla
When your called Martin so you have a team name :)
A bit prediction 😁 Ver Ham Bot  Seb) Per
2:14 already on that  S🅱️inalla track I see.
Where was checo?
Sand was Ferrari master 🅱️lan
What tires did stroll and vettel have on?
Ocon in soft😐
1:02 this livery is sick
Seb hasnt shown his hair since the abuse he got 🙁🙁
This is looking like it could be the best season in the last 10 years!!! Great to see so many major manufacturers joining F1👌👌
Let’s go Lance! We love to see it
A new era begins
All that sand on the circuit was from the Mercedes sandbags...
Alonso and Perez were so fast you couldn't even see them. 🍉🍉
Where was perez?
could the Mercedes gearbox issues affect Mercedes supplied teams? Is it just the engine they supply or the gear box as well?
"Carlos Sainz's debut was smooooth".. I see what you did there Natalie.
"The American team" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“Al-peen”
Rookie yuki
Max Verstappen is already so accomplished: 7th season, 119 GP's, 10 wins, but still only 23 years old. That's scary... He'll be fighting for 8 more WDC's before his 30th birthday.
Didnt you guys try to livestream pre season testing?
Haas being called “American team”. People outside of F1/new fans must be confused.
"struggled for grip"? Or: worked carefully to find the limits of traction in these conditions...
Los subtitulos en español XD
No party mode yet, so... This is just a sandbagging for merc. Literally much sand
Get in there lewis!
i got a f1 ad
The Alpine looks even more amazing under the lights
Anyone notice she missed Riccardo in that top ten at 3:49
I love the white rims on the alfa tauri
Alpin y no alpain
Lewis hemlet is looking certi
Alpine has my favorite livery this year.
3:37 She forgot about ricciardo😂
Honda leaving on a high note?
Bruh im lost with the colours changes on the table
Race Day : HAM BOT VER
the Red Bull’s are gonna be so fast this year
Testing: Mercedes 10th fastest.  Seasons end: Mercedes wins its 8th constructors/drivers title in a row.
Hope everyone knows that Ferrari turned off Charles' PU because they saw an anomaly in the data feedback. Just before anyone else adds another unfunny joke about their engines.
Mercedes was sandbagging SO MUCH that sand was everywhere on the track.
3 days for testing is just ridiculous... F1 has to change so many things... At least I hope Australia will bring us some surprising reability issues for the GP due the lack of testing...
2:07 i see what you did there. Pretty "smooth"
2021 Cracow GP 😂
Those MF gave charles seb's broken car.
What is the T tyre that Lance ran?
Finally
Not a bad choice of track for the opener,,I would like to se McLaren or RB get another championship,,I’ve a hunch we might even see multiple winners this year...Something like last seasons Moto Gp ,that would be something,,,you never know.
Mazepig
video not available....
I missed this!
I love formula 1
the alphatauri tho 🔥🔥🔥
Sand all over the shop
All the sand on the track came from Mercedes
where alonso
hmu if Aussies know how to watch testing
Hey f1, can you upload longer highlights?
Y'all just trying to trick us in to thinking it won't be HAM BOT VER this season... 😝
“The American team” hahaha more like the Russian team!
gearbox issues and they had to dismantle the whole car. dubious.
Is it pronounced “alpeen” or “alpine” (like pine tree)
Merc now sandbagging with actual sand
This leaderboard is BS. You cannot compare drivers who drove in the morning vs afternoon / night sessions. The environment is completely different. All the top 6 did their tests in the later session. Come on F1, you can do better than that.
1:30.674 is the time to beat, Checou
Thanks for the PT-BR subtitles, guys.
Esteban "Zats For Chour" Ocon
Mazespin :P
Ashton Martin looks more Mercedes than actual Mercedes, I'm confused...
This year's liveries look so refreshing when they're racing together
Alonso much? ..
What does the T tyre mean??
What happened with Perez?
Pov: watching f1 2021 and an american team is running a russian Livery  HILARIOUS
Is that really how you are going to pronounce ALPINE?
Verstappen campeon 2021
What happened to Checo?
So hyped
2:12 Welcome to the sBinnala club Carlos Sainz! <3
How could you miss the chance to say 'Carlos Sainz's debut was SMOOOTH OPERATION' !?!?
The season hasn't even started yet and Bottas is already unlucky.  Seriously. If this guy didn't have bad luck, he wouldn't have any kind of luck at all.
Thank You F1 to Legend to Brazillian Portuguese
2:06 carlos sainz' s debut in red was smooth though I saw what you did there 🌚
Boa tem tradução para Brasil
Last day of testing !  Mercedes 1.28 😊
Those sparks are so cool
Sand leaking out of those merc sandbags
So Max is for sure the number 1 driver 100+ laps and Sergio gets 0 lol
This year not Mercedes year? Pog?
”the american team running two rookie drivers This season”... you meant the russian team, right?😝
Giovinazzi > Hamilton
I know we can’t trust testing, but this year looks a lot more competitive
1st what tire did the Aston Martins have i dont know what T means and second why didn't they show the Russian flag for mazepin.
This is gonna be a fun season.
Day 1 Ferrari Master 🅱️lan
Please stop comparing lap times in pre season testing, it doesn't matter at all
huh charles gonna get owned this yeah go carlos ahahaha !
i really don't like it when you count these times so seriously... it makes no sense specially when the season hasn't even started yet.
Hey Carlos wssup? S🅱️innala
yay captions!
Me alegra  que ya hay sub Español  hacia falta 🤝🏼👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Why they didn't just go to Barcelona???
What american team?
If Verstappen doesn't get a WC sometime,  there is a problem 😮
i think this rally F1
2:37 "American" Team :D _laughs in russian chemical money_
"Carlos Sainz' debut in red was smooth, though..."    I see what you did
The RedBull with the HONDA logo is the most beautiful car this year
Mercedes's sandbagging so much they bring back the sandstorm. Impressive.
How come Alfa's front wing looks like it's made of plastic???
Never understood why pre season testing is not held in venues like Spa where the real performances of the cars are tested. The pre season in Sakhir and the conditions will never occur in the calender.Just pointless. BTW aston martin looks sick!!
The team color on the board is going to be an issue.  It used to be that you can just look at the color and immediately determine what team it is.  Right now, both Alpine and Red Bull are slightly different shade of blue.  Both Mercedes and Aston Martin are different shade of green.  FIA and Liberty needs to sort this out.
YES .... so ready
Dumbest track for pre-season testing of any F1 season in history.
Ferrari not even leading pre season testing, that's gonna be rough
That Alpine air intake is MASSIVE.
"alpeen"
great journalism..."Hamilton uncharacteristically struggled for grip"...was there not a SAND storm?
"Alpeeeeen" Vs Alpine. 🤔 I'll let Ocon confirm it
Say no to Nikita Molestpin
Até que enfim ... Legendado em Português, hhahaha meu inglês intermediário não dava conta porraaa !!!
Mercedes, Williams, Alpine, Redbull, Alpha: 50 shades of blue
Forza Ferrari
The Ferrari Master 🅱️lan is in full motion
Mercedes putting all of Bahrain's sand in bags to put on their car for the testing..
FINALLY! Darude - Sandstorm
Ferrari already struggling with the engine reability 😂
aw man I wished the editor of this video had used Darude - Sandstorm as the bgm
Mazepin.... in the Russian bought "American" Haas.... not a fan.
Aston looking 🔥
What's the "T" tyres the Aston Martin are using? special test tyres?
Mercedes sandbagging so hard people thought it was a sandstorm
Riciardo doesn't even exist in her timing sheet😂😂
No one is going to show proper pace in testing for all we know the Williams is faster then the red bull 😂
The beginning of another year of F1 parades.
Guys were can I buy a subscription to watch all of th is?
Mercedes is bored to race against F2 cars
The cars are boke easily
Music of the day: Darude - Sandstorm
So they only have 1 car ?
Mazepin is ahead of Schumacher  Everyone:impossible
The Haas car needs a bit of grey or black on it rather than just the Russian flag. It looks more like a Williams than the Williams
Legal q tão botando a legenda em pt br
Darude - Sandstorm intensifies
Great to see the new cars and finally getting some new f1 action but I have a problem with the abbreviation for Schumacher with it saying MSC when I feel it should just be SCH as the origin of MSC was due to there being 2 Schumachers on the grid but we only have one now sooooo   Needs changing
Thank you for subtitles!
"Yucky Tsunoda" I know ur British, but it's not that hard to pronounce 🙄
Days of drought are over boys lezgo
What is that "T" compound?
Sandy from brawl stars met F1
Will always enjoy Lewis struggling
Ferrari upgraded the power unit Let's start the tractor 😂
So no one's gonna talk about today's special guest is Darude?
From this video, I think Max gets his maiden title this year  edit: I WAS RIGHT!!!!!!!!
Where’s Perez
When she said Schumacher at 3:58 my heart skipped a beat
Uhm, what happened to the life stream...
Anyone notice Mazepin has a blank flag
Williams deserves to be last if they gave an entire day to Nissany
The sandstorm made the sky and air look like the f1 games
"Sainz debut was smooth" i see what you did there lol
You guys missed the oportunity to bang some Darude
Bring back Will Buxton
Mazepin is the worst
Why Mazepin's flag  is white?
The onboard of the Ferraris look much more stable than last year! Let's hope for the best!
Oh sheeet boys its back!
I’ve missed this sooooo, soooo much!!
No comments on McLaren?
2:16 lovely shot from seb in green
Se agradecen los sub español , ojalá los sigan habilitado
Er who is Daniel Riccarlo ?
Can someone get me a link for the Ferrari Facemasks?
Whats that song?  Sakhir- Sandstorm
British racing green is much nicer than Pepto Pink!
Why at Bahrain tho?
2:07 I see what you did there 😂
Mercedes sand bagging it and having a party behind those shades
I still cant get over of the shier beauty of the Alpine livery
The amount of sandbagging on mercedes is more sand than bahrain
Where Fernando.
Alpine livery is so nice
All that flying sand is from the pits of mercedes
Interesting that Mazepin was mentioned after SCH even though the classification is otherwise.
This sound.... please give back v8❤
Mazepin's russian flag looks a bit strange..
did astin give stroll the black find camera housing (normally given to the team No.1/ the illumines yellow for the other driver) over  seb?
Unlucky is Bottas' middle name nowadays
Sand tires.
We can stop calling @HaasF1 an “American team”.  Same as Mercedes and Renault are British based teams, but known and referred to as “German” or “French” because of their main backers and support, Haas should be called what it has become in 2021.
That Aston is like the New Balance of the grid in those colours, so different
F1Dakar???
Mercedes is sandbaging soo much that they dropped all the sand on the track
your video did not tell the full story. poor journalism. you should have divided the summary into the morning and afternoon sessions.... and explained who did half days and full days.....  for example.... ricardo finished 7th overall for the day.... but was actually the quickest in the morning session. red bull.... mclaren.... both looked strong.
Kann hier jmd deutsch?
i dont care what anyone says, i like the way the new Williams car looks, especially on track
Alpine looks beauty
all the cars look really slick this year - alpine and aston especially. Really looking forward to what the season will bring us!
The grid is looking vibrant as ever. Loving the look most of them (looking at you, Ferrari).
The Bahrain sand caused everyone to SANDbag. . . . K imma shut up now
Season didn’t even start and I’m already confused about the tyre system...
Where is sergio??
Ooooooh ! All those new colors are nice
"Carlos Sainz' debut in red was smooth though"   *I see what you did there.*
Can someone please tell me what the "T" tyre stands for?
“Alpeen”
Idk that racing green don’t be looking like racing green to me...
As usual Mercedes are playing the struggling game in preseason testing
Sand was making some shots look like they were from the Codemasters games, couldn't tell the difference at some points lol
Al peen?  the jokes are gonna write themselves
We will get to see Bottas' rallying skills if there is sand during the race. Crofty will definitely make a note of that.
daniel ricciardo got ignored lol 3:47
2:45 Rookie Yookie
Anyone know what the 'T' compund is next to sebs fastest time? I'm thinking it might be the low-profile testing but im not too sure :/
Mercedes struggling on testing?  Welp, pack it up boys. Looks like they got this year’s championship secured
Well it seems red->green will not bring any change to Seb's fortunes
What tyres did stroll and vettel have on ?? (T) ??
hope thats the most laps mazepin completes this season
Ferrari: "In terms of engines, we have no engines."
The second Ferrari and turn 11 don’t get along well
F1 is baccccccccccccck! 👌🏾
"It was a shock to see Mercedes 'struggle'." This is winter testing, they always pretend to struggle
That Honda rear wing logo looks so beautiful😍
As American seeing the HAAS with a Russian flag hurts
This timing sheet really showcases the difference between pre season testing and the actual races...
rookie yuki
She announced Schumacher before Mazepin at the end, even though Mazepin had a faster lap
Kann nicht drauf warten die Reaktion von Marcell D'Avis auf den Haas zu sehen!
Mercs didn’t have tech issues, their lead is so big, they don’t even need testing... this was the biggest sandbag of all time! In fact, they were sandbagging so hard, it caused a sandstorm!
Please let this be the year Mercedes isn’t going to monopolize the podium...
Great piece...what's the music playing?
and about the testing rules, is only allow put one car on track..?? on matter on track or in pit, the only same one car you can testing?
It's always fun to see people draw conclusions at testing, especially on day 1.
Tf is “T” tyre
Do you guys think Hulkenberg will ever return to F1 again?
What is the background song?
Will Buxton saying “I don’t like sand” was magnificent
Can't wait for tomorrow to see all the other drivers who didn't test today!
I wanna see Max & Lewis have a FULL ON STANDOFF this year!!😂The shootout would be legendary!!🤝
Max worries too much about fastest lap, Mercedes is testing for fastest way to championships .........
Are they testing in Tatooine?
The American team haha
I would really like to see Sebastian Vettel bring in the win for Aston Martin.
Can anyone explain what tyres are Aston Martin using? What does the "T" mean?
Max verstappen 2021 world champion?!
What does driving around in a dust storm prove other than filling trans and engines full of debris and no real grip...........
Can't wait when will sound "lights out and away we go"
Ooooooh I’m excited
Carlos is really fitting in for Ferrari and Seb
what happened to alpines testing livery?
Imagine this being the final score in a race. wow. btw where perez?
Alexa play Darude Sandstorm
Is there a explation for why charles ferrari stopped?
So cool
All of the liveries look great this year. Yes, even the Williams.  Also really looking forward to seeing what Yuki can do.
Great test by the Italian Jesus. So underrated.
Se tiver algum membro do Brasil aí, dá um joínha!!!
Pretty excited for this F1 season
i dont get how 6 days cut to 3 days test to save money, the whole team and hardware on the track, and setup everything for F1 car running already, especially covid19 things,shipping and traveling is the most tricky part ,spend so much resources only for 3 days, why not stay few more day, make the most of it ,everything ready ,empty track is ready, but just cant put those amazing machine on track, just little bit waste money.
F1: if we test in bahrain the weather won't ruin everything Desert: Oh well hello thereeee
We back boiiiss lets go
And the season is over Mercedes will win again
2:37 The American team getting paid to run two rookie drivers this season *
Thank you so much I'm waiting every year for this 2:00
I think Hamilton was loosing control intentionally in the last laps, it seems the sandbags, even after leaking and causing a sandstorm, were not enough to slow him down. Congrats to Verstappen, my fav driver, but I still expect a "Get in there Lewis" from the first race. Really sad. Congrats Hamilton for the 8th title.
Why isn't there a Russian flag after Mazepin name on the results board?
The Mercedes Halo just looks perfect for the overhead camera
Vettel has dubbed Carlos thee new sbinallist
Why are they talking like these times are relevant?
Why did Seb  get the yellow T-bar?
Carl🅾️s S🅰️inz
2:13 it wasn’t a spin it was s🅱️inalla
Mercedes Sandboxing as usual 🙄
looks like another year of driving with the handbrake on for Ferrari
Ferrari be like Mission Christmas
The Williams looks worse out on track..
Ahh pronunciation issues....  Alpine, not Al-peen You-ki, not yucky Vasser not vasseuerrr
Can someone tell me what the rack on the back of bottas car was?
this year we got the best liveries so far
that Aston Martin is the most beautiful F1 car that I've ever seen, and I mean it.
I didnt knew the Ferrari car had a moustache ?!?
"2021's 3rd Rookie Yuki Tsunoda" is a mighty tongue twister!
Anakin Skywalker watching this session: *AAAAAAAAAAAAAA–*
the satin blue Alpine 🥵🥵
Mercedes car: They sandbag me so hard
Let’s hope this year is finally the ‘bulls’ year...
Get mazepin out that car
Why is the white flag next to Mazepin?
Ngl, the Williams doesn't look as bad as I thought it would be.
Finally some asian in F1 other than Albon.
Rookie Yuki lol
I hope Mercedes will have the same performance and in race weekends
Mercedes's sand all over the track
What happened to Pérez?
Sainz first S🅱️inalla🙌🏻       They grow up so fast... 😭
1:12 those reflections on that satin finish tho😍
Redbull as always 🔥
Who's sick? Why does she always say people are sick? Can't she pronounce SIXTH?
Racing in the desert is borderline... testing is complete stupidity.
4:01 Look at Mazepin's flag, he's French now lol
FORMULA 1 IS BACK LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!!!!!
williams looks cool af
2:11 Mystery solved: Sainz has the same screen outlook as Leclerc, and I'm happy because I like this one a lot. Another mystery solved at 3:54: Merely a blank white for Mazepin. It Could've equally been the F1 logo against white, but a triviality. Gasly a Bahrain specialist? Yes, he finished 4th in 2018 but was relatively invisible in both races last year and struggled the year before at RBR.
An "american team"
YESS💥💥
I am so excited for the 2021 season. The thrill of watching f1 and f2 is just different from any other sport.
Ooooo interesting the mercs are 10th
Can Formula One stop acting like Ferrari didn't cheat. Don't say "help their fortunes", actually point out how they cheated and were forced to go back.
wait wait wait wait wait... it's pronounced Al-PEEN??
"Unlucky Bottas" some things stay the same
i would forbid drivers to choose numbers...champion should be number 1 and his team mate number 2...everybody else should be getting the numbers based on where the team ended the year...
Ferrari: New power unit guys .Yaayy... Sainz: Changes his tune from Smooth Operator to Slowww Operator.
ah yes, Yucky Tsunoda
You cant unsee this:  The Alfa has a moustache.
yookie tsunoda 2:46
2:06 They had to do that on purpose right
Ha, RookieYuki
Lol people thinking the mercy won’t be playing games at the start of the season
I’m loving the 3 fins on the front of the Ferrari 😂
Merc is is literally having sandbag in their car
Mercedes Using hard tires though out the 1st day.  While most are using med / softs. Lol
she says 'sixth' just like Super GT
That Mercedes looks even worse in the light
Did they update the track cameras? They look kwispppyyy
She forgot to mention Ricciardo in the top ten smh
2:07 smooooooooth operrtoooor
Lewis struggled due to the tyres not being gone!!!!!
What does T tyre stand for on the AMRs? Test tyre?
2021 is here !!!
What are “T” tires? Test?
"The American team" *Russian flag approaching out of sandstorm*
An American team running 2 rookie drivers Do you mean the Russian team?
What does tyre "T" means?
Not a Williams, a early 2000 Sauber.
The gradiants look a lot better in real life
Is this song in the background called „Darude Sandstorm“?
Another new melodramatic testing episode by drama queen and his team..
Vettel car is the yelllow point.
Just please keep it up F1.  I so look forward to this every year. Always love for the grid!
Reading out the timings: "Giovinazzi, the two AlphaTauri and Lewis Hamilton rounding out the top 10."  Danny Ric:
"The American team" meanwhile the entire car is plastered in Russian flags.... Ironic
That blue shade and type of paint on the Alpine car is fantastic.
that alpine is such a beauty
Looks like Seb's car is given to Sainz junior !! Spin on first day itself.
I can't get enough of this girl's voice idk why i just like it
Now I know we say this every year, but PLEEEEEASE let this be the year that Mercedes dominance ends and we can see a shuffled grid!!!!!!!
Why was Checo not here?
It's lights out and way we go.....!
Amazing how they have to white out the Russian flag next to Mazepin’s name, but Haas can plaster it all over the American team’s livery. Unbelievable.
WE DONT WANT MAZEPIN ON THE GRID !
Carlos even spins smoothly
I can't believe F1 is almost here!!!!! Wooooo
Where's perez
3:48. Riccardo be like
Let's  go Norris
2:12 truly embracing his role as vettel replacement
lets go yuki tsunoda! represent asia for this season! g!
3:57 love how she is saying Schumacher before mazepin
Would've made sense if they played Sandstorm as the background music
In the sand storm right now
Those names.... Making me hungry....
Who turned the graphics settings to ultra fine?
I have been waiting so long to see the cars finally back on the track
Woah They Look New There 2021 Design Looks Great Four The New F1 Series's
That's a Ferrari centipede!
Who invited Darude?
Vettel: *left.* S🅱️inalla: *stayed.*
Here we go again
what does 't' mean in terms of the tyres?
3:58 Mazepin were faster than Schumacher!
3:54 I know that Mazepin was Russian, but...
mercedes sandbaggin level ferrari 2020
-mercs struggle! -is mercedes in trouble? -mercs are in a bad shape! aus gp: get in there lewis
Alpeen? Eww
Anyone else laugh at ‘third rookie Yuki’
That last scene showing all the cars and drivers was epic
F1, retrain your film crew.  So annoyed with ridiculous close ups.  I can’t even see the whole car, much less the line, or the track or any background.  FFS, need a whole picture.
Sainz debut was smooth... see what you did there
2:06 So you could say Carlos was a smooth operator?
2:16: sainz at home already
Did Alonso run the test ? His name isn’t at the classification board .
I see carlos is already learning the art of the s🅱️inlla
Ferrari the best team of ever
Aston Martin looks amazing.. 🔥🔥🔥
its testing ffs, its way better to break things now then in actual season start rofl... Also w/e happens during the tests the only important thing is that teams can improve the car from the data they gather, in the past there have been plenty of time where teams would top the time charts and fail when the season started...
Don't give me false hope.  I hope this is an open season.
Ferrari still doing their trend whit new driver hehe.
Mercedes dont need sandbagging. They dont even need testing. They are having a party in the pits.Merc 1-2 sadly.
Seb is 2nd driver with yellow t-cam ??
Ocon: “No reliability issues”... few seconds after   Me: *sees breaks literally flaming
So what are those tyres on the Astons?
*Mercedes now midfield team confirmed*
She had to use the word smooth on Carlos Sainz 😂😂😂 ... smooth!
It looks like F1 2020
Carlos p5 Daniel p7 mclarren regretting
Mercedes sandbagging per usual
And Mercedes wins the 2021 title
Be epic if redbull stomp mercedes this season
The alpine looks weird with that huge upper engine cover
Max wants it.
Day 1 Highlights: Martin Brundle makes bigoted comments about Americans, loses his privileges for covering the USGP.
Sainz did a s🅱️innalla!
Folks, answer me this: What does Mercedes gain by sandbagging? Everyone is saying they're sandbagging but what would be the point? They're considered the team to beat anyway, and it's not like Red Bull is suddenly gonna slow down if Merc looks weak in testing. If you can all see it, so can the other teams, so what would be the point?  Especially with only 24 hours of track time, it would be the stupidest move not to run for 4.5 hours
The Aston Martin needs to be more greener. It almost blends into black, making it look like the Mercedes
Nikita white flag ?
I keep confusing the alpha tauri, the aston martin, and the Mercedes when te cars are facing towards the camera
What does a t tyre mean
idk why but i want mazepin to do well.
Ngl Williams looks a lot better out on track then it does in the reveal
Fact (not fun): antonio has never finished a race at belgium in F1
Should have Darude playing in the background! LOL
Pierre Gasly - Bahrain tarmac specialist
Da rude... sandstorm. There! I said it!
“2021st third rookie Yuki” sounded so clean
that Alfa Romeo looks aggressive from a front view
puzzling as to why gasly still has the green t cam on him while being the more experienced in AT. even at AM lance has the black t cam now as compared to seb
Can't wait to get started!! ❤️❤️❤️
Ferrari: * *Gets new engine* *  Leclerc's engine: * *HMMMM, HOW BOUT NO* *
Close Haas with a black square
Here's to Seb, for him literally moving on to greener pastures
sandstorms came from the sandbags of mercedes after a mechanic accidentaly dropped one
Hey admin, stop deleting comments please
2:24 the amount of understeer in corner 10...
Valtteri, It's James
2:07 Smoooooooooooooooth
It's pronounced 'Alpine' - Not Alpeen.
first s🅱️in of the season folks
Looks like Mercedes had a lot of sand to grab for their bags
“Carlos Sainz’s debut in red was SMOOOOOTH though” I see it’s not just Ferrari’s IG account that’s getting funner these days
Alonso?
Ik it’s foolish but the merc struggles do give you a bit of hope
Did anyone notice that they've introduced 2 new kind of tyres?
Can someone explain to me what kind of tyres the Aston Martin drivers were using? 2022 Test Tyres?
Awesome looking cars this year
Hamilton loved to literally sand bag by going off track
I know why you mixed Mazepin Schumacher and in overall :)
Question about Mazepin's nationality: I know he has no nationality for testing but for the start of the season, will he be eligible to race under the Belarusian flag due to his dad being born there?
Sandy
Sandstorm caused my Mercedes sandbaging
What it the "T" at the AM tires stands for?
mercedes sandbagging so much it spilled on the track
- "Song ?"  - "Bahrain - Sandstorm"
Lando ahead of Ricciardo, Stroll ahead of Vettel, Sainz ahead of Leclerc.  Whilst I'm sure this isn't representative of full race pace, it's certainly spicy.
Yeesss, my boi Carlos did his first s🅱️in. Welcome to the club.       :Vettel left the group.
2:07 The word she chose to speak, talking about Carlos... That's pretty "smooth"...!! ;)
Why isn't the background music Darude - Sandstorm ??
Carlos got in an ferrari and spun What in the world is wrong with the 2nd ferrari
I am very excited for the 2021 season
yucky tsunoda?
Now Carlos takeover the Vettel's Sbinalla
4:05  F1 2021, is here!
no ones gonna talk about the unmarked tires on the astons ? xD
Formula one is back!!!!!😎
Aston martin team will win this season. Because Seb is in the team!
Mercedes sand bagging already lol
Me: "whats the name of that song???" also me: "sakhir sandstorm..."
All that sand was from Mercedes’ sandbags, right?
F1: *Racing under the dessert*   Dakar: *finally a worth opponent*
We are waiting to hear *"it's lights out and here we go"* 👻👻  But don't wanna hear *"wings flying at the turn 1"* 😁😁💪
This Video just makes me happy :)
Anyone wants to start a poll? How long is Mazepin going to last before he gets DQ from F1 ?
couldn't be more happy for bottas. That guy really deserves this
S🅱️inalla Sainz, so where are those million comments about Vettel now?
2:11 Pronto Carlos
Man that Ferrari gets uglier every year .... but that Aston is stunning
Carlos smooth as we thought
Y los subtitulos? En Latinoamérica tambien vemos la F1
"Third Rookie Yuki" rolls right off the tongue
2:59 "with Kimi Räikkönen and Tonio Giovinazzi." xD
Raikkonen, Schumacher, Alonso. Never thought I'd see the day those three names would be on the same grid again.
_"Carlos Sainz's debut was smooth"_ I see what you did there...
Wow Haas having trouble? Who would have thought?
We all already know the favorites. This means nothing.
Darude!
Hahahaahaha yeah im certain the merc is just total garbage. Funny how they alwats somehow get it together between testing and season
Where's Checo?
Not gonna lie the motherland car look kinda nice on track
Willians the tropical fish car
Song name?
Did anyone else got confused Aston Martin for Mercedes from the front view
EngineersToto how much we have to sandbag today?  Totroll: Darude Sandstorm.
I waited for this so long!
Lol everybody's gangster until Mercedes turn up tomorrow with a whole different car😂
2:12   Car🅱️os  S🅱️inz
I always get excited for testing even though its a total joke and we wont know anything until qualifying.
I know its not representiv but it gives me hope that Lewis struggles so hard and Max doesnt have any problems.
That Aston looks soo cool. Hoping Seb and Mic have stellar seasons.
But where is Alonso???
G E A R B O X  I S S U E S
There were times when while pre-season testing we rarely had any kind of footage of the new cars etc. thankfully F1 give us the opportunity to have this clips & highlights. I for sure am very hyped to the new season and the cars looks awesome ! Stay safe everyone
The soundtrack choice couldn't have been better
It's not a problem here to find sand for the Merc bags
sky exklusive is so trash. Wish i could buy f1 tv pro like last year...
“2021’s third rookie Yuki Tsunoda” easy for you to say
What tire is "T" supposed to be?
Now we back to 2018 tyre program
Has Hamilton made the apex at least once?😅
look at all that sand, someone should get some sacks and clear it up. Mercedes : we have plenty of that already.....
I have predictions for this season:  1. It's 2. hard 3. to 4. say 5. just 6. after 7. first 8. testing 9. day 10. HAAS
@3:40 she really gonna skip the honey badger like that
Did Darude arrive in Bahrain or something?
Why does Schumacher have the russian car?
Me watching testing like 👁👄👁
Ladies and gentlemen ! WELCOME TO THE SAKHIR RALLY featuring legends such as Raikkonen, Hamilton, Vettel , Alonso and much more !!!!
Max had wings under that Red Bull car today.
Hmm, another season and these are still not in 4K 😛
If Vettel can’t outpace stroll he’s done for . Shame as I do like Vettel . I hope he’s still got it
Yuki with the fresh cut
3:54 Is this a graphical error or is there a real regulation which prevents russians from representing their country? I'd love to know.
Im so stoked. Cant wait for lights out.
they got daniel and lando the wrong way around lol. Daniel was 2nd and lando was 7th
Such a wasted opporrunity for Darude - Sandstorm... 😀
Looks like the Red Bull is reliable at the start of the year. If this holds true then thats one weakness of the Red Bull reduced. I wonder about their straight line speed though, given that the Mercs always pull away on the straights.
that time of year again i see
Gotta respect red bull. Getting as many laps and as much data as they possibly can throughout the day.  Where as the mercs were kept in the pits swapping Lewis’s pedals.
Merc are sandbagging in a storm of sand. Spicy
3:50 Danny ric just got totally ignored lol
"The Americen team" yeah...right...
Sandbagging in the sand
Please Max. Can't bare to see Hypocrite Hamilton win another title.
I think one of Mercedes Sandbags leaked into the air
"The American team running two rookie drivers, this year"  Putin: "Lol".
Merc sandbagging again..."oh redbull is defininitely gonna challenge us this time, its gonna be difficult"
Yeeeees
When merc r just waiting in the garage as they know there car is not even F1 anymore and It can pass for a jet
4:04 Vettel is standing in between his 2 former team cars, one side Red Bull and Ferrari on the other.
Russell with Mercedes, sooo many failures. No Russell= championships to Mercedes. Russell will never be Mercedes F1 driver, sorry. And will never be F1 champion :/
I  was very happy not to see Merc in the morning running.
All the sand came out of the mercedes sand bagging
Why do I keep hearing it pronounced "Al-peen"? Surely they don't think squirrels live in "peen" trees instead of pine trees?
I think I know what caused that sandstorm: some bag in one of the Mercedes must have leaked out....
Merc sandbagging like usual...
2:45 rookie-yookie
would be perfect if you put Dadure-Sanstorm as background music
3:49 My man Ricciardo got disrespected like that. Wow...
Forza Giovinazzi
Sainz the new S🅱️inalla???
That Alpine looks amazing while moving
Hope this season will be as beautiful as the cars.
Rookie Yuki
It's funny that the speaker says that Schumacher is ahead of Mazepin although it's the other way round
even bahrain is sandbagging
past 7 years mercedes slow in practice could redbull win? australia (or bahrain this year) crofty:"and it's a mercedes 1-2". I Cancel my f1tv subscription and watch motogp instead then repeat for next year
al peen
3:48 they forgot Ricciardo
What the 't' tyre on the timing screen for stroll and Vettel?
2:36 ekhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...........American?
Aston Martin Baby!
コースコンディション悪過ぎｗｗ　　リアウィングの「ＨＯＮＤＡ」ロゴがカッコイイ！
Humm..now this feels familiar..oh yes the last 7 seasons 😂😂😭🤣😀😂
FORZA FERRARI!!
Mercedes sandbagging already
If there's a sandstorm in the race, that's gonna be awesome, like Turkey last year I think
Lando norris is going to win this year. 100%
What’s the (T) tires next to Aston Martin
Aston and Alpine look smashing!
Why does it say T on Aston Martins tyre selection?
Fred Vesseur? I think it's Frederic...
Bruh
Anyone noticed a couple of drivers with a 'T' on their tyre? What does that mean?
2:06 I saw what you did there!                             SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTH OPERATOOOOOOOOOOOORRR
yo who switched the red bull livery with the mercedes livery....
turn 11 plus the second ferrari equals spin
*The American team*  see’s Russian flag all over the car
So Day 1 overreactions:  1. Mercedes is finished.  2. Max Verstappen World Champion.  3. Red Bull Constructor Champion. 4. Mclaren top 3 again.  What else did I miss?
S🅱innala
broken gearbox after 1 lap. Merc is gone this season.
Its really difficult to distinguish aston martins from mercs, specially under lights
Bless you peole for doing this
I can't unsee how absolutely THICC the Alpine intake is
Ferrari: We have improved the slow button!
*Mark my words* Rd.1 results: HAM BOT VER
Aston Martin go go
remember... only 10 days left to IT'S RACE WEEK    🏎️feels and sounds so gorgeous in my head😊
BMW: we have the biggest grill a man has made F1 aerodynamics things: hold my grill
Before i like hass. Now i hate hass
Merc´s sandbagging: going off track in a desert
3:44 where is Ricardo?
2:46 RukiYuki
Commentator: And the unlucky Bottas finishing the time table  Me: You can say that again  James: Valtrie its James
Bronto Carlos?
2:12 you learn from the best
only difference for Ferrari car:             G r e e n M i s s i o n L o g o
Honestly, the pink in the Aston Martin has grown on me
Williams livery is nuts holy f, that gradient blue with a outline of orange, what a masterpiece to elevate the white nose
New level unlocked: Sandstorm
WE ARE BACK BABY
Its OOOON BABYYYY <3
alPINE not alPEEN
What means the T (tires) behind Lance and Seb? Have they used Testtires from Pirelli for development or what?
American team but painted with the Russian flag.
Unlucky bottas 💔😂
I want the rainbow halo back on the mclaren it looked amazing
mfw i seen mercs results: dont do that, dont give me hope
Mercedes sandbagging went horribly wrong that made sand storm😂
I don’t like this why is Mercedes sandbagging but like last was the same and they one the year so shouldn’t be a problem 😁
The amount of sand used by Mercedes is more than enough to cover the whole Sahara desert
where the lap count at?
Why does the aston look better in pictures, only shines in the sun, in the shade its mehh
4:05 So cool!
sainz test was smooth hmmmmmmmm                          smooooooooooooooooth operator
Everyone: Mercs are done  Mercs: I guess the time of the year has come  later  Everyone: I cant wait for next year
Mercedes at Bahrain gp: Reverse card!
Ferrari masterplan
@2:07 I totally expected the sentence to end with "operator though".
mark my words:  1. mercedes (as usual) 2. red bull (way ahead of the midfield but also way behind mercedes) 3. aston martin (more than 200 points) 4. mclaren (more than 200 points) 5. alpine (close to ferrari but still ahead) 6. ferrari (about 150 points) 7. alpha tauri (similar to last year) 8. alfa romeo (more points than last year, around 30) 9./10. haas & williams (both 0 points)
AMR 🚀🚀
Notice how she read SHUMACHER first before she read MAZEPIN! Yet the latter was first in the pecking order and faster o ever all.
New viewers are now going to think that Haas are actually a Russian team 🤦‍♂️
2:12 its kinda of a tradition now...
Ferrari s🅱️inalla as per usual
Williams really wasting a day with Nissany though
We've just got to remember that *testing times mean nothing* and we don't want to get our hopes up for a Mercedes struggle season. Let's see what tomorrow brings
what is the T tyre aston used?
Weather alert: merc sandbags leaked and created a storm around the circuit
Alpine looks soo competitive I love it
I don't like sand. It's coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.
2:12 welcome to the club, smooth operator
I think that the Mercedes is covering Wath they can do like the previous test but the gearbox problem of valteri is serious I think and you
Why is there some yellow on some aero parts of the car??
Carlos already filling in for Seb's spinning I see 😂
So Both drivers get the same car to drive in testing..they just change the stickers or what???
Sainz getting his spin in early I see
Sandbagging more Mercedes. At the end, we all know it will be Mercedes 1-2 race after race.
The bahrain sandstorm was in 2009 and now its back in 2021.
3:48 Ricciardo: Am I a joke to you?
The lap times doesn’t matter at this stage, it means nothing
“Ferrari hoping a new power unit will bring them better success” 5 seconds later “Leclerc was running ok until a power unit problem”
Christ Verstappen is a machine, he’s definitely getting 2nd this year (at least, if Mercedes keep this up 👀)
2:10 I see what you did there with that transition, smooth f1... smooth.
2:13 first s🅱innala of the year
Don’t want to get my hopes up but MCL35M P2 🤞🤞
rookie yuki
Looks like merc has brought all the sand from Sahara desert
All beautiful liveries this year I have to say...
Aston And RedBull looks So nice happy to see F1 Back
that sandstorm was created due to the mercedes sandbags having a small leakage during the afternoon.
2:36 Isn't it Russian?
People relax. Mercedes are *CLEARLY* just getting ready for reverse-grid racing.
Ferrari finishing p3 at least
Now the green on Ferrari looks even worse
Aston and Alpine look even better in the sun ! Can't wait to see them in the races.
2:11 S🅱️inning is part of our 🅱️lan
I so cannot wait, Redbull just might pull it off as they have what I believe to be the strongest Duo on the grid.
How much sand Toto? Toto: Yes
Really looking forward to seeing Yuki Tsunoda in action in an F1 race.
Ferrari: We've got new power unit means we're gonna be fast this yr. Meanwhile 1st day 1st session of F1 testing Ferrari: Ok charles slow button on, slow button on.
Sainz starting where vettel left off S🅱️innala
will fernando return in this season or the next?
Merc: sandbagging intensifies in the Sandstorm
Ocon 3rd :)
that wasn't a sandstorm, I think some of Mercedes' sandbags fell off
3:44 Why bother about Ricciardo😂
Vettel 😂
Ferrari continuous in shape. PU issue and s🅱inalla
Hopefully not RedBull as champions
F1 is back.
The Ferrari livery is a mess. Worst one for me.
Fake Problems by Mercedes
Yukis new haircut be hitting different.
I'm calling it, Mercedes won't win this year
Please let us watch f1 TV pro also in italy
merc sandbagged so much it spilled all over the dang circuit.... now watch em enter the first race and qualify 3 seconds faster than everyone else but that aside, dude the alpine looks sick under the lights
another easy title win for hamilton
Had to say that Carlos had a smooth start!
do we all are just gonna forget kimi's 1.12.8?
merc downfall
f1 is back *everyone liked that*
Ferrari fixing the engine to only have it broken later, irony
3:45 she skipped Ricciardo😅
Where's will Buxton
the aston looks fire in the sun
I think the mercedes leaked some sand from theire  sandbags
Smoooooothest Operator is back #55.
Sand everywhere, even in MotoGP testing in Qatar
F1
Mercedes had a leak in their sandbag
Yes.... Finally
This looks like the trailer to a new fortnite season
The Alpine looks epic
what is it with these people pronouncing sixth as sikth? is it some sort of dialect?
Where was perez?
HYPE is REAL!🔥🔥
I’ve never been so happy to hear this woman’s voice commenting on the session 😂
Mercedes were actually having a party behind that black screen seeing how slow the competition is.
Letss goo
More like Mercedes sandbag storm.
I don’t wanna jinx anything but is this finally the year that Mercedes cars won’t be over powered?
Someone is taking Darude Sandstorm to the next Level
Bwoah F1 season is about to start
Ahh yes, the daily dose of highlights and F1 are finally back
Where my Perez fans at?
The season break this year was exponentially better than last year. Please don't do that again.
older guys might be pacing themselves
Don’t rely on times from testing. We won’t know the situation until q3.
you naughty naughty, you teasin me
🚨CARS ON TRACK🚨
Imagine a Sandstorm mid race to make the road slippery and then a rainstorm so they drive through mud
either the alpine cooling is terrible or the FIA might wanna check their engine
pronto, carlos? SBINALLA
You lucky guys watched f1 testing as *I* was doing online classes
Testing, testing
The alpine car looks really nice
Mercedes sandbags are too light...
New Feature for the F1 Game Weather: Sandstorm
tokyo drift
This WRC stage looks different...
Finally F1 is back
Darude - Sandstorm
Top ten comments deserve a ps4 or ps5 with f1 game hahaha
Why are they doing testing in the middle of the desert. Barcelona was fine
Engineers must love the sand :P
What we learned:Mazes🅱️in locks up and spins.
Bottas already getting his gearbox given to Lewis.
Merc´s sandbaggin is now on another level
Ashton Martin lookin sick
F1 is comming
Top
New WDC Raikonon
The Desert Gods had a plan for them with that sandstorm
THE ASTON MARTIN LOOKS SICK
I can’t wait for the start of the season all the livery’s look great with some exceptions some driver switches can so exited
I like how it says 3 views but 26 comments and 61 likes
