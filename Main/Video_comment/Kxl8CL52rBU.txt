Hearing This For The First Time In 2025 😮‍💨🔥
Liked and commented. This song is ART
Gunna listen to me very closely. This is you best song. Great sample , great vocals, rapping is 9/10 but everything is phenomenal. This is your best track to date. Well done
Don't know why some groopy ass niggas judge more than appreciate.
2027
It’s a gift and a curse 🅿️🖤
“Yea I copped out but don’t let them say I told”….”Never crossed lines all I did was play my part”
This guy is too good so touching🥰😍
That guitar reminds me of deftones entombed
My secession tells me she's in Iowa 500 billion dollar deal leave it be highest command
I was released from bing incarcerated the same time as gunna. Was going through a lot with so called friends and life itself was sideways… I’m still here going strong mentally physically & spiritually. Honestly, God & Gunna have been my inspiration to persevere.
Don’t nobody want this man no where back on no damn block wthellyy 😂😂

Gunna is killing it on this track! The only reason he’s not getting more hits is because he hasn’t checked out the short on my channel that breaks down how all these rappers are blowing up so big.💖💖💖

[Chorus] Oh Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh  [Verse 1] I was just thinkin' 'bout the times I was hard-headed Thought it was right all along, I was misled All this weight on my back feelin' so heavy These boys claim they want war, well, I'm war-ready I had to bake cake for the boy 'cause he playin' petty I was so focused on the top and I'm still at it They try to provoke me to stop, no, I won't, damn it They want me to go back to the block, no, no, no I done gained a whole lot of more opps, now I'm home Niggas' nose all in mine, don't know how to mind they own Twenty-three and one, how you feel when you alone?

This shit soooooo fire 🔥
I'm stiĺl here in 2024 from Cape Town
Refrain] Oh Oh ouais Oh ouais Oh  [Verset 1] Je pensais juste aux moments où j'avais la tête dure Je pensais que c'était bien depuis le début, j'ai été induit en erreur Tout ce poids sur mon dos me semble si lourd Ces garçons prétendent qu'ils veulent la guerre, eh bien, je suis prêt à la guerre J'ai dû faire un gâteau pour le garçon parce qu'il joue mesquin J'étais tellement concentré sur le sommet et j'y suis toujours Ils essaient de me pousser à arrêter, non, je ne le ferai pas, bon sang Ils veulent que je retourne au bloc, non, non, non J'ai gagné beaucoup plus d'opportunités, maintenant je suis à la maison Le nez des négros est entièrement dans le mien, je ne sais pas comment s'en soucier Vingt-trois et un, comment te sens-tu quand tu es seul ? C'est quatre murs qui te parlent, te disent que tu es parti (te dis que tu es parti) Seulement, j'ai pleuré à cause de ce sentiment pour mon frère (King Slime) Et tu connais mon esprit, tu as vu ce négro grandir (J'ai regardé ce négro grandir) Je sais que tu entends les mensonges que ton petit frère pourrait mentir (Gunna Wunna) Ouais, je m'en suis sorti, mais ne les laisse pas dire que je l'ai dit Non, je ne suis pas vous, petits garçons, je vais vous montrer que je suis adulte Blindez les gros jouets, laissez-moi vous montrer comment nous roulons Les vieux négros dans mon entreprise ont dû leur dire de se boucher le nez. Vous ne pouvez pas supporter ça, j'en ai cent, c'est sûr (cent, c'est sûr)  Refrain] Oh ouais Oh ouais Oh ouais Oh  [Couplet 2] Je pensais juste à la merde que je ne pouvais pas éviter Je ne peux pas me permettre de la merde jusqu'à ce que je sois sur Forbes J'ai fait beaucoup de merde, les négros n'étaient pas là pour dire que je commence Je n'ai jamais franchi les limites, tout ce que j'ai fait c'est jouer mon rôle Je ne signe pas pour un centime, à mon nom, j'en ai eu un quart Juste un vingt-cinq léger et je n'avais pas tout en ordre Les négros pensent que je vais mourir, ils ne savent pas que je suis immortel Non, je ne suis pas Nino Brown, mais je suis de retour comme au Carter Je viens de me défoncer, je ne veux jamais être sobre Elle a dit qu'elle allait monter, alors je lui ai acheté le grand Rover La jeune Gunna devient plus sage, ne pense jamais que c'est fini Nous avons coupé les liens et je leur ai donné l'épaule froide Je jure que cette vie te façonnera (Oh) Bon sang, je reviens, je sais que ça fait une minute J'ai acheté une nouvelle garde-robe, les salopes disent qu'un négro est maigre Les poches sont toujours, euh, potelées, Dieu sait que je dois l'avoir Je te le dirai cette fois-ci, ils vont détester ça quand ils s'y opposeront  [Refrain] Oh, ouais (Ils vont détester ça quand ils s'y opposent) Oh ouais Oh ouais Oh
Love that guy ❤

Free Jeff gets gunna let’s go
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Bruh u need learn how explain shitt better. I’m still lost Af listening to this
I never really gave 2 shitz about this artist... really i didn't know who he was until well ya'll know yet this album is a classic, thats my opinion only. He's a rat in some eyes yet in mine i see just the artist. Im an artist wishing my words could be put to a song. Think us raw like uncut not rehearsal
No features no back up singers no as shakers just real uncut raw YOU MF CANT FK WITH ME excuse my language, I felt this in my soul 🐐
Wunna !!🅿️👊🏽
💯💯💯💯💯😁
He just gets better and better
I love this song
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Gunna you did your big 1️⃣ on this though 🥺🥵🥰🤲🏽
fucked up what you did to Thug
This is the type of album you put on repeat on a road trip. Absolutely fire, original, and a showmanship unseen before. I see this as Gunna's best work of art yet. He was definitely spending time writing new material jail and his hellish experience allowed him to create
This album is so good because it has a message behind every song. Songs we the fans can in most ways relate to.
Bruh, this nigga put pain, anger, frustration, bravado, hope and regret all in one song. Gunna is a fuckin genius!!!!
I WAS JUST THINKING,  WHY I HAVEN'T FOLLOWED GUNNA?
💯🔥❤🌹🥂🍾
That whole album is bangin’
Make us remember 2023❤❤❤
GOOD EVENING! YOUNG MAN AND ALL YOUR FOLLOWERS PLEASE GIVE JESUS CHRIST A TRY!! HE IS THE ONLY WAY AND TRUE WAY! DONT LET SATAN WIN YOU ALL OVER TO HELL!!   REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED AND ACCEPT THE TRUTH!! PLEASE PLEASE! PLEASE DO IT BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!  MUCH LOVE
This ain’t gunna 100%  Voice different and looks totally different…idc what no one says.

The best omg the verses this song is so dope
i want a video for Paybach P
My American friends, can u explain to me - Is Gunna 100% snitch or we dont have enough proofs and information about this shit? Why all rapers ignore Gunna, if they do not able to hear Young Thug's oppinion now? Thank you
Gunna has been one of my top artists for a while now. The sound and delivery of the music is just in a class of its own.
🐀🐁🐭🐁
This how you come back...
Woowop?!
I will never understand how grown ass men express so much love for each other when it comes to proving a point this is really the world we living in if you didn’t tell and you his bro he should know better that’s called trust! I just wish men like them had this energy for their kids and families
No morals that's what Young Thug  sign dues that been rating sense day one
Adversity is a blessing.
Bro a rat
too dope
No I ain’t you lil boys. Imma show you that I’m grown
He wanted to get out and fuck bbl and get them new Mario boots 🥾
Music is good man. Keep it coming. Speaks to me bro.
🐀 🐀
Still believe @Gunna sgot the best album , hell, dam shit is fire
Leave young thug flow 👮‍♂️🐀🤥
He lost weight 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Yea! Gunna looks really good!! Love for Gunna! Straight talk only.
“Ain’t no way I’m a monkey if I’m flying above it” moment -BS  I wanted Nate to beat your ass from the way that you were talking but then I was like it is his character  But then I was like jake Paul has been fighting and then I genuinely believed in him  I still think that jake Paul can become the greatest in his class  The hook he decided to use was IQ sauce and swag status  Congratulations 🍾🎉
Best song on the album for sure
❤️‍🔥Tell’em Gunna 🤜🏽🤛🏽
He spelled snitching wrong
He’s just to talented.
Best song on the album. Best song of the year so far.

The lawyer and the Da did some sneaky $hit and you fell for it??? That’s …. Ummm accidentally snitching I think… I really don’t care though this album fire as F&@k!!!!   This song should have more views though … this joint hard bro.

When an artist is an artist it's no need to involve ourselves as fans of the music to focus in their personal lives because we really dont  know these people nor do we know the real truth. The media is designed to cause the people to fuss it was created for distractions and disruption.  Whats important is staying focused on the music. So yes do I still like gunna music yes would I still listen to him yes. You cant deny the mans talent creativity  that he has. It's what he brings to the world as an artist not his personal business & life. I hope things get better for everyone peace&blessings .
This album is going to go down as a classic

Gunnas glowup is my inspiration
So if you tell on yourself and your gang you turn into a superstar 😂😂😂
Bro hasn’t snitched on anyone he copped a plea and part of it said he had to testify in court. He hasn’t testified yet.. so there for he didn’t snitch...Yet..

Bro we gotta let this man kno he’s being shadow banned
I was just thinking how few people reach age 60 in perfect health and a strong sex drive. How how many can also pass for a decade or more younger. No medication needed or required. Heart rate normal and lungs perfect. I can sprint down the street.  My body heals itself. I should have arthritis due to breaking bones and x-ray saw beginning of it. However more than a decade later no arthritis at all. Right leg was shorter by 3/4 inch die to hell crushed. However leg now only 1/4 shorter, walking present no problems. I can smoke cigarettes and cannabis all day Long with out health consequences. I spit out peices of bad lungs and they regrow. Funny is where ever I go, I get to listen to music that is all about ME.
Love for gunna❤
Dude don’t even sound the same

Nobody Hate Gunna Business is Business  Witch means only Him And His Business can only be discussed with The Ones At the table Thing Gone be good Gunna gone be good regardless it's just sometime Business don't go as plain and finding understanding is only within the ones who truly love one another Two Goats Two Bosses And life ain't always to respond on when you far cross the world and you peacing together clues g Code broken at that point check your self @LifeIsToGood
Idk, gunna being the underdog and having to kinda fend for himself makes me wanna root for bro. Go wunna, go

Good job Gunna..rap that shit.
Gunna fan base is legendary we can’t be f with industry mad asf 😂
Remember lil boosie was crying in jail when he got bumped by the feds. He didn’t last 2 weeks trying to get bond. Gunna was locked in for almost a whole year. Gunna have his own crew before thugga he got a whole ATL crip side he fk with that thugga don’t even know cause they don’t kick it with Cleveland Avenue bloods. Gunna a whole slime and ain’t not rapper or street dude ever gunna confront him about anything in person cause gunna and his people can turn shit up.
Thinking about poor young thug while remorses melts you inside
That's right Gunna live your life  Our culture is so powerful!! Imagine if we stick together we could be a force to be reckoned with but, instead we are doing the opposite fighting and killing each other 😡🤬🤬
Je stealing ppl music  shit crazy asf 😂clout chasing
No disrespect cuz I like this but gives me roddy rich vibes
I fuks with gunna 💯🔥🔥🔥
never gets old
Keep doing your thing baby😘💪😎👍
RAT
This weak af... Wasnt no rush for son to get out 😂
Son rapping about being in jail... He was locked up for how long? Smh these new ninjas different. Idk if thug told son to do what he gotta to get out but i doubt it
That first verse hits different when you can actually identify with it 💯 I know all about that 23/1 lock down 4 walls talking to you and you have no choice but to listen to them voices in your head
Yeahhh Gunna Wunna ! Let that music TALK!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
"You wack niggas can't get wit dis I'm 100 fasho" 🔥

Gunnas talent is insane dude is probably one of the best artists Iv seen in this new generation of rap. Specially the ATL I mean for real tho.

1:27 All You Need To Hear
They hating on the hardest artist in YSL tho😂😂😂😂 if gunna trash then the ysl team gotta be worse than trash🤦🏾‍♂️on top of that living by WHAT code??? Countless of times the gov And police have shown to break any “code” you mfs have which is why half these mfs go down and you guys made a name for the word “snitch” gunna did what he had to do tho it’s not his fault his dumb ass team is in the streets being wild asf, why he gotta go down for mfs who ain’t even on his level???? Bring me one nigga from ysl who can demolish gunnas career then ill shut up😂 that nigga was not going down for mfs that don’t even fw him and went to post “free bro” all the time as if that shit gonna help😂 mfs just want to  ride the wave for clout but I don’t follow the crowd! Talent is talent and GUNNA IS the talent of YSL!💯🌊 them YSL niggas should be looked at because why did they do some stupid shit to begin with? Then get caught? he even said he copped out so we don’t even know the entire situation mfs act like they was REALLY there when it happened😒 as far as I know it ain’t my business and bro dropping  more heat than thug and YSL right now. As far as I can tell mfs are riding just as hard on thugs dick as much as gunnas 🤷🏽‍♂️
I really thought that was Gucci man on the guitar for a sec
To gunna , just know we forever rocking wit you . With this album you gave us a different you . That’s what makes you different from others . Keep your head up .
He's trash !
@GUNNA THIS SO PLATINUM REAL TALK I FEEL THIS IN HEART
Gunna lost mad weight
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He's singing or He's rapping ?  What kind of artist is he  ?  These days the people who say they are rappers are really singers and the singers think they're rappers
At this point everybody else, mixtape and 💿 they came out, is trash but this one right here is number one say what you want about him. I’m not fine with no crabs in a bucket and I’m on the beach free. You must be crazy you have a good day.
better than YB
I’ll never put my nigga in a situation to tell on me… and expect him not to fold… Y’all gotta take you licks…accountability
Lol dude snitched , came home, then write a song bout how he didn't snitch
Hard 🔥🔥🔥
Yall not fuckin wit gunna. This 🔥🔥 💯 omg
Gunna be skinny ohHhHhH
Gunna's album the best thing to drop in 2023.❤🎉😊
honestly i aint follow none of this but let this man live and make these hits... my guy is talented lawdd
GUNNA AINT SNITCH ON ME STAYING SOLID🗣🗣
yooo even thug him self said this man is a rat.... and all of u still like him? he ratted on the person who put him on and didnt even take a dollar. that shows who he truly is a coward..s0 h0w is a rat helping u get thry times hahah.
🐀  🧀 🔥
Is it true that Gunna is a rat?
Snitch or not gunna is the shit🔥🔥🔥
My mans thinning like God daamn😂
The fact remains that most regular people don’t give 2fucks about street. The album bangs 👍🏾
So nobody gon acknowledge how in shape Gunna is now. That boy got some cut. Been exercising He rapping way deeper know too. I'm proud of this man. He like a phoenix rising from the ashes
Y2WGANG
Shit 🔥
Wonder what Pac would think if he was still here?
Music from rats still slaps this shit hard but you definitely told the moment you said “yes maam” to us YSL a gang sorry but ain’t no way around it but you talented asf and I love ya music
free thug
This is fire
So u copied out no u ain't tell. U don't cop out on no case before u know what's going on with yo big bro first and Know for sure it's not going to affect him. Nvgga u ain't the only one that was doing 23n1 Thug is too... Nvgga u should of check with Thug before u cop out on a case with codefendants especially yo ppl tf.... They damn sure should t have had u wit the because ignorance of the law when u out here is not an excuse..clown
THEY GONNA HATE THAT I WENT AGAINST IT. F**K EM KEEP GOIN
🐀🐀🐀🐀
First man to out rap Snitching charges lol he too hot we gotta tune in 😂
That’s crazy… y’all didn’t support Six9 like this 😂 and his crew Kidnapped him, Slept with his girl, extorted him. YSL did nothing to Gunna for him to Roll Over on the gang. Explain…
Rat rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Rat Eat Sat Eat Eat Rat
Gunna's 'I was just thinking' video is a vibe-filled journey worth taking.
"Only I done cried 'cause this feelin' for my bro (King Slime)"  Idk if Thug still fw Gunna but it sound like Gunna do
I need him to sign me this song raw asf
Snitch!
Give them war @gunnawunna
2.22m subs  2.22m views. mans got solid fans

cat food
This song is a vibe 🔥🔥
“Yea I copped out , but they can’t say I told “
Gunna 😢❤amo este tipo
Cant keep a nigga like this in one place🔥
Damn back in  the day they said dead rappers get better promotion , now rats are winning with the craziest excuses besides they just weren't built like that. Instead of coming home telling the kids don't fuck with the streets and make the mistakes they did, they're telling there opps don't play with them for being snitches and how they'll pull up on them. How you making songs playing victim to shit you claimed you was down with🤦‍♂️now everyone will make him richer and more successful over pitty for that man being a snitch. There's no absolute excuse for snitching when you playing super gangster in these streets.
who caught that wack 100 sneak diss
He forgot a - in front of that 100 for sure and anybody rocking with this shit is a rat for sure
I had to bake a cake for the boy, he playing petty🤣
IF YALL HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION. GUNNA BEEN IN THE BACKGROUND FOR SOO LONG. BECAUSE HE BECAME SOO HOT HATE FROM HIS OWN PEERS CAME. HE IS THE GREATEST FROM YSL AND THEY KNOW THAT. LET GUNNA BREATHE PLEASE HE IS THE FUTURE  OF RAP MUSIC
Bro said he was ready but in reality he court room ready 💀
On Blood gang durk dont have nothing on gunna when it come to art work
I was just pretending  I was just snitching
🐀 🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀
Whole Album Slaaaaaaapps
Mind blowing 🫡🤧
Gunna✊

yall need to update the price on thugs album from $4.99 to $8.99
Gunna looks good did he lose weight
You can't criticize his music he's just a good artist hands down he's good no matter what has happened between him and Young Thug
This is what happens when you poke a bear 🔥
This might be his best album no features J COLE shit 🥇
Whole Album 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Kno you hear the lies that your lil brother might fold, yea i had copped out but dont let them say i told"
Gunna dat mfn nigga idgaf what you say🗣️🗣️💯‼️
I hate to say this but this rat is a musical gem but overshadowed by his action and the people you keep around you might not be the best interest for your long term 🎉 on making it out
I had to hit subscribe just to make sure this brother make it.  There's absolutely nothing wronge with looking out for you. You scared of what people might say or think? Well guess what the same people will forget you when you're locked up. Actually they will start with your baby's mom
He cop out don't let tell u I told
“Ysl must end” words of a rat
Is that even gunna tho?
Damn Gunna shit better than Thugs😂
The loop is fire
This shii wak
This one of his hardest songs 🔥🔥🔥
Album of the year so far
Man I can't lie this is some real art! The way he walked out of the dark in the beginning and the darkness stayed there throughout the whole video, that was deep and chilling! Great art
Glad he bounced back shady baby 💯🔥
I was just tellin ......real name to the song
There would be no GUNNA if it wasn't for JEFFREY WILLIAMS ........ FREE JEFFREY WILLIAMS  !!!
Who knew he was gunna tell tho 😂
Can't lie, he sound like Young Thug, but the song is just 🔥🔥🔥
🍯 🥯 🌈

Bought a new wardrobe, bitches sayin' a nigga skinny 🗣️
Imagine your mom birthing you and then you get rid her …that’s thug and gunna
I listen to this alot because I missed this dude.

But again he snitched before. He only did what he was use to doing
Snitch and was only facing a couple years.
💯💯💯💯
yall snitchin
This guy has lyrics
You can always tell when someone slows down or completely stops sipping lean. They lose weight like I lose my car keys
Damn they cloned Gunna like they cloned Gucci. They never get the weight just right
The greatest n y'all have to stop calling the G an snitch why because he's out from the jail
Ngl this song is good and has something to talk about…
Nigga went to the nba trainin camp 😂
😭😭 culture rats now  🐀
Dis shit hard boi u walking
No features. This one of the best albums out rn.
Gunna... Thugga was dangerous enough when he had everything to lose... Crazy when you start to comprehend how dangerous an enemy he is when he aint got nothin to lose. 🐍⏳️
Great album. He was sliding!!
song sux,cant listen to snitch music
Thug spoke u a rat
This rat is more talented than Mickey and Stuart!!!
O like the video
It's not even about the snitching BS with me that's way overrated it's really about a person taking responsibility for their actions everything has consequences so when you involved with bad things and people you have to deal with those consequences as well not all of a sudden want to do the right thing because you in a bad situation one thing about life what goes around comes around.

That's four walls talkin' to you, tellin' you you gone (tellin' you you gone) Only I done cried 'cause this feelin' for my bro (King Slime) And you know my mind, you done watched that nigga grow (watched that nigga grow) Know you hearin' the lies that your lil' brother might fold (Gunna Wunna) Yeah, I had popped out, but don't let 'em say I told No, I ain't you lil' boys, I'ma show you that I'm grown Bulletproof the big toys, let me show you how we roll Old niggas in my business, had to tell 'em tuck they nose You wack niggas can't get with this, I'm one hundred for sure (one hundred for sure) Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh I was just thinkin' 'bout the shit I couldn't avoid Can't afford shit 'til I make it on the Forbes Lotta shit I did, niggas weren't there to say I start I never crossed lines, all I did was play my part I ain't sign for a dime, to my name, I had a quarter Just a light twenty-five and didn't have it all in order Niggas think I'm indicted, they don't know that I'm immortal No, I ain't need no brown, but I'm back like at the Carter I just been gettin' high, I don't never wan' be sober She say she gon' ride, so I got her the big Rover Young Gunna gettin' wiser, don't ever think it's over We done cut off ties and I gave 'em the cold shoulder I swear this life'll mold you (oh) Right the fuck back on, I know it's been a minute Bought a new wardrobe, bitches sayin' a nigga skinny Pockets still, uh, chubby, Lord knows I gotta get it I'll tell you this time around, they gon' hate it when they against it Oh, yeah (they gon' hate it when they against it) Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh

No friends in the industry
Okay maybe don't think next time
😢❤ free smile
Big rat 🐀
Unogona mujaya🔥🔥💯🇿🇼
Ok, let’s be for real. He can never come with the same delivery on that street level.  Jail is what comes with that life so it should’ve been expected.
I don’t like rats But he ain’t my homie so I ain’t got to worry about his loyalty ..this album is fuggensmackin’
That album is immaculate bro. 💎
how yall rocking with him fact he told like even thygga aint messing with him. i can tell yall have never ever been about that life
Regardless the fact he told… buddy got some some good music 🎶. I am bumping it right about now… what he’s not going to do is say he something that he’s not..  I am just saying..
This man Jaqcuees snapped😂😂
🗑
Wow, nobody cares about how he did not stand on what he said.  I guess I know now nobody cares anymore.  Kids pay attention
This album was needed two years ago but it’s never too late change!
No affense to the streets but gunna is just as big as a drake know is the time to separate and blast off fuck that stree shit
Masterpiece ryt here 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😮‍💨
Whole album hard
Most people talking have never Copped out .... Im sure Thug Knows it's over....The Alfred Plea comes with saying I admit some Guilt .... Pray it all gets cleared up in the end 🙏🏾
Gun should get a 69 feature 😂
Still a rat
Gunna snitch
🚮
🔥🔥🔥
Gunna isn't Tekashiiite. His fans will stick with him despite the the fact that he's a rat. That's commendable.
Trash !!!!!!!!!  he aint talking about a dame thang yall be honest with yourselves. Beat go harder than him
From the rats is winnin album.
🔥🔥🔥🔥 Gunna has been my favorite artist since he came in the rap game. Dude has so much talent and can ride a beat. I’m glad to see he’s still getting the support from his true fans.
What a rat…
🍃🔥
🐭
M10g
So glad he’s back 🙏
Coping out is Snitching.
Gunna is a artist not no thug
Popsmoke😂
Can't listen to a snatch put him in the same category  as 69 😢😢
Young Gunna Wunna
This shit whack and he a rat. Free thug
Can’t be war ready if u copped out when it hit the fan u was screaming for peace when them folks applied pressure
69 can’t but he can y’all KRAZY
🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀
I never crossed lines I just played my part 😭
This album is on 🔥..  ❤from🇿🇲
His album is 🔥 guess snitching humbles a rapper and blows them up more then they were. Idgaf if he keeps saying it was part of a plea, that was snitching 💯 percent
I paused the song before it came on, just here for the comments 🍿🥤
Looking Like Cj SoCool 🤣🤣
The Weight loss thooo👏🏾
Cuz got skinny
I don't know none of them niggas for real so don't care do crime do time u got caught.  Nigga music still A 1 regardless
Gunna out for a reason, he’s going keep the label & money coming why thug fight the case!
Being a snitch is the new trend huh 😂😂😂😂😂
My boy gunna lost some weight
That nigga Gunna said stop playing with em 🔥🔥🔥😂
Snitch
I completely forgot he got a album out, I gotta get listen to them joints
TALENT OVER HATE
99% of the people commenting all civilians lol, that shit got nothing to do with us. Just enjoy the music fr
Stop saying you haven’t told. It’s not about that you admitted it was a gang. When a criminal defendant is charged with a crime, a prosecutor can add a gang enhancement, if available under state law. The gang enhancement makes the underlying crime more serious of a charge as the enhancement can add additional jail time and fines on top of a sentence if convicted.
Best album of the year
Snitch 🐀
My baby got skinny 🥺
Is ysl an gang (gunna) yes ma'am . Have you seen or know bout ysl doing illegal activities (gunna) yes ma'am 🤣🤣🤣🤣 nigga you told WTF 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️

Y’all love known criminal snitches…. 🤦‍♂️   He should be celled up with thug.   Known partaker in criminal activity..    He’s “100 for sure “ Lmfao  Y’all corny asf
FREE THUG!!! 😢
this song so beautiful
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🐀 🧀
no honour mr gunna soon you will be six feet down under 😂🎉
snitch
I need Google Rat to translate this song for me
Looking at all these comments like. Ain't none of y'all have honor nor do y'all know the code of the streets. Saying he got haters 😂 the man snitched on KING SLIME. That be like you and your brother take a cookie without asking, your sibling telling you took a cookie. After you get out of trouble he daps you up like no hard feelings 🤣🤣🤣
12 boy
Fed boy
🐀 🧀
His replacement sounds just like him doesn’t really look like him
Man a lotta talking about nothing. If u think this is actually saying something u not that smart. This is a failed attempt at being introspective.
Im a civilian so all that weak as street shit mfs try and act like they sticking to a code is for clowns. Gunna way better than Thug and he dont even have to try..
Brodie harder than slime flat out..
Nigga say he keep it 100, yea right.. more like 12. Idk why y’all listen to these crime stoppers rappers, y’all better off listening to gospel.
This is one scary generation SMFH!!!!
I rather listen to 69
Slick Wack 100 diss

D hope
69 started this shit! thinking u can tell and be aite ! just ignore what they say pshhh ok until that shit catch up.. you didn’t just tell on 1 person that you can move away from and be good ! y’all told on a whole industry a whole platform .. with FANS and people you will NEVER see coming .. God Bless y’all 4real
him and 69 are soon to be best fuckin friends!!

Thinking of 🐭🐭🐭🐭
Think of 🤡🐭🐭🐭🐭🐭🐭🐭
You was thinkng why did you come a 🐭🐭🐭🐭🐭🤧
Every song off the album sounds nearly the same meh...
Secular rap Music is here to distract you, to influence you to sin and fall away from  God, music is one of satans biggest tool to hack your subconscious and make you sin more. These celebs work for satan Wake up people, How blantanly obvious do you want them to be with, lil uzivert telling fans there going to hell with him, Sam smith wearing a satan costume, lil Naz with satan shoes, back chyna having a baphomet tatoo its not a concidence. these celebs have chosen their side, and they have a mission to help lead as many souls to hell in exchange for worldly pleasure, Lucifur runs this world and hes making it real obvious right now and desensitizing us to sin, he runs the media, youtube, all of big corporation, everything he does is to distract you long enough so you dont get closer to God, so that when you die you end up in hell with him. This world will come to pass and where you spend is crucially important.God cares about your salvation not about how he can make you rich.  The most important thing in this life is not what's in your bank account not your career, not worldly pleasure, it is your faith in Jesus Christ because everything will come to past and worldly possession will rust . The better your relationship with Jesus is the stronger your faith becomes. Christ died on the cross for you so you can be saved from the eternal judgement of your sins when you die (Hell). The only way into heaven is to be perfectly righteous. It's impossible for us to be even good for all haved sin and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). God doesn't send people to hell. You send yourself self there because you are a  sinner by default. God cannot allow sin into heaven. This is why your faith in Jesus is important because his blood is counted as righteousness because he live a perfect life and he is the son of God and is the ONLY way you can enter heaven. Do. Not add to the gospel or you will be tainting the finished perfected work of Christ. Your works can't save you, so stop adding that to your faith for salvation. being baptized does not save you, so stop adding. Being good does not save you so stop adding, ONLY YOUR FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST can save you.  You do good things because you are saved not the other way around.i dont want people to die in their sins then go to hell and remember they came accross this message and regreting why they didnt listen, jesus has gotten  me through so much and i cant thank him enough i owe my life to him and he didnt have to die for my and your sins but he did it anyways because he loves us and i want to spread that love anyway i can by leading people to his kingdom. I don't expect you to turn a leaf today, but I hope to plant this seed so that one day you realize Jesus  is our ONLY hope for salvation, but remember No one is promise tommorow so the sooner you accept him as your only hope for salvation, the sooner you can rest assure that have you Jesus as one who will bail you  out of your sin debt and accepted into the kingdom of God where you can live  peacefully with Jesus for eternity
He's somber these days. 🫣
🐀 🐀🐀🐀🐀
I know he upset for snitching 😂

“Yeah I had copped out but don’t let em’ say I told”  1:28
Do not support commerciality or your supporting political moves that actively begin to control your town and that’s what they try and do with money that you give them  Buy a skateboard and the town begins to get controlled outside of your power and they begin to work influence and it supports enslavement and guess what they don’t care about us first you can rid Disney and mainstream influenced “culture” because all that money goes to plotting and schemeing on the poor in active ways and you are not prepared to fight back and the commerciality it does practice lethal experimenting in statistical and quite high minded and they do not know it speak on a single thing so know now and yes these are new practices   Is nabisco in your town and what agendas do these people have and you need to know   To support commercial mainstream supports lethal shady business move and you need to as a people back them down
Yall here commenting on bro stuff but  steady hating low key and saying he told yall 😂yall pick a side.

Bro on fit must be hitting gym more than bitches lately 💪💪💪
He understands now that he is his own best friend... something I understood along time ago..there are good people out there but not many at all. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

TOMÓRROW, КЛЫК — Тонуть

Idk Gunna.. you telling Thug you copped out, but you didn’t tell. When we all heard you say “yes Ma’m” to everything they are trying to prove against Thug. So idk, unless it’s some shit we don’t know, I don’t think Thug trying to hear this bar.   Side Note.. For anybody saying Thug gave him the green light to plea out, this  bar was proof Thug knew nothing about Gunna taking that plea.
Don’t fw snitches but not gonna stop me from listening to their music if it’s hard💯
You can feel da passion from this track
🗣️talk yo shit about this industry as dudes !! they sum suckas kill they own for some bread ts come n go weirdos🤮💯👌🏾
Terrible rapper Terrible song...free thug so we can get some real music
It’s crazy how most of the world including the “fans” in these comments were calling him a rat and shit but now wanna switch up… 😴 crazy af  “It’s a evil world we live in” - future
Ignore the bad energy. Learnt that from gunna
Still rocking wit you my boy 💯 n****** just don't know how to walk that line. 🤷 They put themselves in cages by doing stupid s***then get mad cuz you wasn't as dirty as they was keep getting your money. And if you're ever in Baltimore Maryland tap in nothing but love overhead big dog❤

Can't lie Gunna slid on this one. One of his best projects if not the best. The depth, openess, lyrics  vulnerability.
❤
The symbolism in these visuals is fire! Showing how he was feeling being caged and still somewhat alone after he got out
It’s crazy y’all don’t mess with him but this video got 1.1 million views. Y’all need to pick a side
my boy on the MULTIAC
> Lil baby
I wonder why he didnt have any features
Yall can't tell when they finally walked through that door

I had too pause it twice coz it sounded like someone was tapping the glass on the ranch slider, nah that's just the track.
Good song I guess but the stain can’t b washed away that easy or will ever come out 🤔🤷🏿‍♂️

gunna cant dress always fuckin up wit them long ass pants it jus dont look right
This song changed my life.  I was behind Kroger trying to score something to eat from the dumpster when i overheard this song playing as someone drove by.  I stopped everything I was doing,  sat down,  and stared blankly into the asphalt as I ate some of the fish that I just found.  I was like, man... i should cook this shit before I get sick.  Thanks gunner!
He looks in shape
👑🇺🇸💅🏻👌🏻✌🏻
free thug btw
I  DONT THINK HE TOLD AND I MAY BE WRONG. But I think thug is fully aware of what is going on and neither of them were prepared for those incriminating question that gunna had to answer when he took his Alford plea. which not an admission Of guilt or innocence. so i dont understand why he even had to answer those questions about ysl being a label or a gang. But i forgot them folks do what they want. but i think thug told him to do what he had to do to get out because he was the bread winner. thug need gunna to get out and get his money back up  cause them lawyers a free. thug will be home in 6 mths to a yr
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🐀
Guitar hits, sounds good... Auto tune hits, skip!😂
Life seem to always bowl a nigga ass down that aisle for a fuck n strike AND A NIGGA ALWAYS SEEM TO GET RIGHT BACK IN THAT GOT DAM LANE 🤷🤔

RAT
WHOLE ALBUM IS ABSOLUTELY BRAZYYYY WUNNA SEASON 🫡
how can I stop seing this ad,ur making me madu always showed on my phone,even I'm not serhing your song I'm not interested
We need to understand And not making it about race but as men we need to be better do better. This thug gangster street lifestyle glorified. Maybe not by those rapping but those filling their pockets.  While understanding poverty is the cause of crime and more. And as any person trying to make it in life may be tough but you do things by the correct channels and when they try to take your riches away. They may throw dirt on your name but remain try never food you come out on top
Snitch
Gunna is a huge inspiration to me and I WILL produce a song for him one day.
Go gunna
Gunna🔥🔥🔥
Gunnar’s flow is just filthy. Dawg can really kill any track right now 🍞🧈

That's four walls talkin' to you, tellin' you you gone (Tellin' you you gone) Only I done cried 'cause this feelin' for my bro (King Slime) And you know my mind, you done watched that nigga grow (Watched that nigga grow) Know you hearin' the lies that your lil' brother might fold (Gunna Wunna) Yeah, I had popped out, but don't let 'em say I told No, I ain't you lil' boys, I'ma show you that I'm grown Bulletproof the big toys, let me show you how we roll Old niggas in my business, had to tell 'em tuck they nose You wack niggas can't get with this, I'm one hundred for sure (One hundred for sure)  Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh  I was just thinkin' 'bout the shit I could avoid Can't afford shit 'til I make it on the Forbes Lotta shit I did, niggas weren't there to say I start I never crossed lines, all I did was play my part I ain't sign for a dime, to my name, I had a quarter Just at like twenty-five and didn't have it all in order Niggas think I'm indicted, don't know that I'm immortal No, I ain't need no brown, but I'm back like at the Carter I just been gettin' high, I don't never wan' be sober She say she gon' ride, so I got her the big Rover Young Gunna gettin' wiser, don't ever think it's over We done cut off ties and I gave 'em the cold shoulder I swear this life'll mold you (Oh) Right the fuck back on, I know it's been a minute Bought a new wardrobe, bitches sayin' a nigga skinny Pockets still, uh, chubby, Lord knows I gotta get it I'll tell you this time around, they gon' hate it when they against it  Oh, yeah (They gon' hate it when they against it) Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh

💨Good✅ yes more, Lil durk BETTER🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"i swear this life will mold ya" - 🎯
Is dude trying to convince us or himself that he didn’t rat in these tracks!!?
Gunna has proven his worth. 😭
Gunna has proven his worth. 😭
This sucks
Nope
Fire
The Album is just fire🔥🔥🔥🔥.Seeing this man how talented with his rapping is crazy.🔥🔥
😢😢❤❤
Came here to dislike
Bro literally ended thug’s entire defence with saying it’s a gang and not his drugs when it was just the two of them in the car 🤦‍♂️ just an overall selfish person 😞
I love you bro ❤
Tell Durk to make a song by himself and hit #1
I love how he handling his situation he ain't out here acting like 6ix9ine did
The album is amazing
Congratulations
We love you but we need fat gunna back
He sold young thug flow 😮 this crazy
Say what you want but he's definitely making way better music than his peers that turned on him. You can try and best him on the street shit, but cant touch him on the music shit.
Gunna bro I love you even though we ain't met. Don't let them haters get to you👊🏾❤️
Fire
Mooon mooon mooon mooon  Я играю чувствами, тебе не понять  Хватит, прекрати шум, не в твою пользу  Меня не поменять, я не уязвим  Какие афаризмы, я не драг хилл!
imagine if this video views is our subscriber 🤤🤤
Best song on the album
❤❤ Love thus man🎉🎉🎉🎉
Dude lost weight in jail man. Hope he came out stronger. He is the best artist in the modern rapscene and will be forever a legend to me
i was just thinking...of snitching 😉
Happy Wunna gradually finding his groove back. We’re all rooting for you Gun… F*ck them industry rap n*ggs for real
The crazy thing is that if you TRULY support Thuggah  you gotta SUPPORT Gunna right now. I bet bro the only one sending coins consistently to Thugg outta all of them... And regardless of what folks think, bruh didn't tell. Or admit to anything them folks didn't already know nor does he have anything to do with The  Rico/ "M"case Thuggah is fighting now. It is two separate cases and events. If you have been in a similar case or situation you would truly understand. Most of y'all just be talking and never even stepped foot in a courthouse..frfr
Album 🔥🔥🔥🔥😤😤
Rat
" I 👮ed out but ain't told " 😂😂😂😂 yea ok
How can you call a man a snitch when he said what was already fact?
Wunna100 💪
He done turned g@y
I was just thinking Sbout Snitching

I like gunna bro got a clean heart you can tell he ain’t a violent nigga…it’s a shame he going through this nonsense 😒….tracks lava too 🗣️🔥🔥🔥
bru talkn that shxt we know the true bru a wisper he just repeatedwhat they already was told and mfs holdn that over his head cuz they illiterates
This Is The Energy! So Much Going On Right Now That We Need A Positive Message Just To Not Fall Off! Gunna Speaking That Real Shxt Cause Nobody Knows How Anybody Feels When They Back Is Against The Wall! 💪🏾💯🔥🙏🏾 Gunna Wunna Keep Bringing These Vibes & Messages To Your Craft Bro 💯💯💯 F That Other Fake Noise 😎
🐁
How this nigga snitch on Thug and drop shit through YSL/300? Copped out, told, snitched, same shit goofy niggas. Silent or telling. You told on Thug, keep crying for that goofy shit.
The visuals made the song better
This is one of them videos that make the song even better… and I love the fact that Gunna has evolved…and what makes this album so dope is because it appears to be personal and the anticipation of hearing what Gunna had to say played in his a favor because he readied his self to do just what he knew everyone wanted him to do…I just didn’t expect for him to pop back so hard…. The 808s on Cash Shit and Fukumean should intimidate whoever the fuck he is aiming at because that shit slammin’ !!!! And I’m glad he’s Talkin that shit like he WUNNA 👑
W snitch anthem🔥🔥🔥
Copped out but never told!
Wynn’s the one bro god got is hand on him
Going hard gang 🗣️
This one issa a Masterpiece  Bro been on Pain For real   🔥 📛 👩‍🚒 🚒
He still doin his thing💯
🔥🔥🔥
God damn this shit so fire
Snitch
I have been trying to understand why people border listening to Gunna if he is a rat thou in my opinion that’s forgivable i guess but coming to the comment section makes absolutely 0 sense you take your time watch the video of a rat and not end there read the comments and it doesn’t end there also you reply to people’s comments negatively what’s the motive? Why you take so much time and energy just to hate? What’s wrong with people? Can’t you use this time to listen to the rappers “you” believe are “real niggas” comment show them some love for keeping your soul alive instead you taking so much time and energy just to hate
felt this ❤️‍🩹
Shame he's so lonely in his latest music, he's always alone! 😂🤣 Go get em Wanna
Got your back no matter what, it's that slime🐍

Best song on album and best album so far this year
Nigga back on his shit🔥😤
Album fire. Snitching ass 🥷
Lemme remix
@1:27 "Yeah i had copped out but don't let them say i told".  My nigga,  "DO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE FOLLOWiNG STATEMENT,  I RECOGNIZE, ACCEPT AND DEEPLY REGRET THAT MY TALENT AND MUSIC INDIRECTLY  FURTHERED YSL THE GANG TO THE DETRIMENT OF MY COMMUNITY, YSL MUST END AS A GANG, IS THAT YOUR STATEMENT OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT?  GUNNA: YES!  " Bruh, at least just admit that you told and move on with it, stop insulting our intelligence. At least 69 admits to what he did. You look corny saying you didn't tell. Hard to listen to your music when you say things like that, i wont deny your talent though.
Appreciate y’all supporting him it helps thugga 🙏🫡
Chest up then 🐎❤️

WUNNA
Gunna outchea
Gunna needed to be here for his fam an to make these summer slaps
I hope he go number 1 in the whole country
Born innocent in this land of games and lies to figure out established thousands of years before me. My parents playing and keep secrets for outsiders and I'm starting to add to my weight holding me back and down and taking offense of organizations I claim but contradict behind my back in my face. So now respect my race and my gender and sexuality and my relationship and my drug and my religion and my children and my job bosses and all that when I'm in your presence but you have your freedom and nobody is making you and you got a choice like a full garden but I failed and lost so you know you gotta and you Gon get all the others in the same order or it's hell to pay as I'm on you and in you and day you to object. I dont care how many times youve been checked or tempted tested nor what you got going on in facts its about my opinion or its hell to pay.
I copped out i never told

This Album Is Amazing Bro 🔥🥇🍾

Gunna paid alot of YouTubers accounts for the comments lol  I see most accounts opened last week to  four weeks max 😂
I’m not a gang member and I don’t condone gang activity. But loyalty is very big to me. All blood, guns, and etc was cool until the case hit. I’ll never be a fan of Gunna no matter how melodic his music is.  Free Thugga
Glad my favorite song from the tape got a video 😁. Can we get one for Go Crazy next!!??

Y,all saying he snitch,do you expect him to waste is life in prison when he has a chance to be free 😂
It's not like something we have not heard or seen before......lil durk doing his version of "we are the world" type song with J.Cole......its stale and predictable like the rest of these songs nowadays.

GUNNNNA THE GOAT 🖤🖤🖤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m fucking with this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gunna hitting harder then ever this album
My favorite song after paybach
Bro he stole the harmony from wicked acapella. Wake up people…. Y’all give him props for what exactly? I know the label wanna see him win so a lot of y’all commenting but this boy ain’t loyal to shit.. how long gunna been trying to get into the industry? He got booked with thug then told on thug he stole the harmony from the song called wicked 😂😂😂😂 y’all mofos funny asf. Gunna you should move my guy your a snake and people see that. You don’t have your own style you go off the next man’s flow you can see it with lil baby lil durk and young thug. For all you silly mofos go listen to other hip hop songs and see what gunna biting from. It’s called Wicked listen to the acapella verision
I'm not going to lie, I was never a Gunna fan. I didn't really care for his music, but this man's album is 🔥You can learn a lot about a person when they go through their darkest times. This man is resilient 💯
Anyone else feel like a Ye collab on this woulda been CRAZY ‼️

I Copped Out, But Don't Let Them Tell You That I Told 😅 👨🏼‍⚖️
Thug album gone have a song on there called yes ma’am
Thug know what he doing! This man is out and making what the label needs at this time and that’s money! Thug losing a lot of chips and material things while locked down. What use was it for both of them to be in jail when Gunna is clearly an earner! The streets ain’t feeding Thug and all his homies folded or told. Keep doing your thang Gunna because you understand the assignment. If you eat then he eats and that’s simple.
Bro aint fat anymore ❤
He going hard
He say i know you analyzing yo little brother might fold yeah i copped out but dont let them say i told
I hate not hearing WHEEZY OUTTA HERE not even on one song , but fvck it GUNNA is all that matters 💀

Well looks like his clean and lost weight after prison.
Ik there's niggas in the industry playing favorites to snitches like lil baby fake ass but doesn't change the fact u told on thug... U was in videos throwing up the same gang or label thug threw up. He's the reason u where u at today n u cashed him in to make it back to ur position. Now I'm not going to say thug ain't wrong for putting u in the mix because he is. But having ur brothers best interest at heart is a must and if y'all really loved each other like brothers u know I ain't wrong for what I said.. wish you the best GUNNA
Lets keep going Gunna Wunna!
Snitching respectfully won’t make you cancelled💯

Hip Hop was all about telling your story I'm glad to see a current artist getting back to the basics of real hip-hop music story telling
Gunna is the king of Trap no cap 😤🐐
Imagine thug came out and he didn’t f w him, another classic album..
This video super hard. Keep ya head up Wunna
My favorite song off the album listen to what he saying 🔥
The fact that his music is still being released by young slime life tells me everything I need to know about his ‘snitching’ allegations
pop smoke - Woo
dat man say he ain sign fa a dam dime, to his name he hadda qtr..stawp playin wit da boa
Kids doint sign up for  this street shit if .......................... This shit lame🤐🙈🙉🙊
It’s crazy how much weight you lose when you’re sober

Keep going bro. It’s times like this that really show who was fake & who was really f’n with you. Now you know.

Gunna never misses. Always killing it on whatever Gunna is on.
🔥 🔥
Rat
HARD 🔥🔥🔥🔥
W GUNNA WUNNA
Gunna lost some weight. This shit got him stressed.
Gunna tello is back
Gunna told for sure. I can’t lie he definitely not a gangster, but he makes good music. Still a snitch!
Snitch gang
I think he kept it solid. They recorded that man to make the others snitch. If you from Georgia than you know Georgia give time like the feds with no options. The saying in Georgia... Come to Georgia on vacation, leave on probation. Gunna ain't tell, Atlanta so pack with gangs and Mexican cartel. They been putting the belt to blacks & hispanics
Gunna really been snappin' like He aint got shit prove shytt !!! 🔥🔥
The creative direction for this album has been soooo cohesive and it’s 🔥🔥🔥
Gunna you keep on pushing  , They know you the Goat and what ever you touch turn in to gold❤❤❤
He lost weight
Him and 69 should make a joint album
I was just thinking that Wunna is the best out.
Make a song called yes ma'am
Damn he got skinny
Hope he feeding their canteens 👀
Damn gunna is crazy
Gunna one of da only artist dat can drop a album no features and it do wat it do , Drake da other one besides him dat can do dat no skips btw
3 young thug. F the rats
While they were busy sneaking disses in Wunna was working on a million dollar project
Who produced this??? Bass sounds like trash. Stop blowing speakers with trash mixing....
Who’s here listening to gunna more since he exposed lil baby 😅
Gunna lookin healthy. love to see it
Slime Prada U twin 🤝🏽💚
If this album manages to reach top 10 with no features and no promo from other artists we can clearly say that Gunna is one of the gratest rappers from the past 4-5 years
Only in America can a nigga tell you he's not snitching show proof he didn't snitch and people still call him a snitch
Streets don’t have hip hop hostage anymore. 😊😊😊😊
Mfs thought gunna was fired that nigga said “F*ck everybody!” And clocked back in🦾😭
🔥🔥🔥
Drop the music video for Fuckumean!!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Gunna tell music trash this not it get back to that drip to hard vibe smh
Young wunna Gunna better
Gunna wunna flo❤
Love it
Nobody ever questioned Gunna talent... He always makes great music... But if you about that life and u squeel on your man's to save your ass you a 🐀... Most people are not in that life who listens to his music . So that don't care if he a 🐀 or not .. they think it's cool 😂... They growing up off social media .. they don't care about principles and values...
YSL🔥🐍💪🏾
Fire  🔥  You still snitched 😂
Trash free thug
Thug know where the check gone come from....Don't be surprised if some of these rappers start saying they been sending slime money in jail
All those fake fans don’t care about snitching. Unless it someone you don’t like. 🤷‍♂️
You still a reat
Is just me or gunna skinny now😮
I’m rocking w Wunna. 🤞🏾
All lies. You crossed the line, can’t be 100

Bro really hurt fr lol
he always Gunna give us hits🔥 lets appreciate this man.
They claim the want war but I’m war ready smh bar
Rich homie wrote that
This man hasn’t missed
Gunna delivers!
I wish him and all artists that have cases over their head the best of luck… gotta stay to urself n don’t speak on shit to no one… I always heard the top was lonely I always prepared myself for the top n never reached it too.. it’s boring but peaceful solo
Talent overshadows hate regardless of the situation. This dude can’t be denied
this one my favorite from the album. he really went 15 for 15 with this project.
Some say he snitched. I like to look at it as he outsmarted the system. He found a loophole in the matrix. It's similar to how a slave found a way to escape the plantation and avoid a life of slavery. It sucks that other slaves will be whipped for his escape. At least one got away to have another chance at freedom. Happy Juneteenth my brothers, and sisters.
Love you gunna.
Wanna home!! free king 🐍
Gonna Been dropping Crazy keep going fuck how these people feel ya music still 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Gunna managed to get the heat off him lol
Very 🅿️
Who else is enjoying the guitars🎉
South side college Park
🔥🔥🔥
🐀
The last album before everything went left was heat . So I didn’t expect nuthin less from Gunna .
At least now he know who realy fuks with him and who don't!
Mr Kitchens has been my favorite artist since I was a teen 🅿️💯
FIRST
Gunna💯❤️
The I not being capitalized makes me cringe
Lol all that RATTING GOTUM SLIM WITH A BIG HEAD LOL. FREE THUGGA THO
“old niggas in my business i had to tell em tap they nose” 🔥
Can’t even hate on gunna tbh
Gunna tell
Young Stoner Life Records is owned by Thug. NO ONE can say he ratted or turned his back, it’s clear to see something fishy went down and he’s still YSL. Gunna haters are tripping big time
This man is TALENTED!!!!!!!!! Say what you want but Gunna that N*gga
🐐

🐭
Let’s make this album number one ☝️
Gunna the Goat💯
Gunna u a rat 🐀
Finally Gunna actually got a normal outfit on
One of my favorite songs on the album 💪🏾🔥🔥
This masterpiece tells us that this gentleman doesn’t need the industry🇳🇬🇳🇬
This album a summer vibe fr..🌴
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This shit all planned out  How haven’t many others caught on by now? This shit is so fake and phony. These lyrics were just stolen and or given to him from the industry after they helped pay his way out of his charges and yada yada. Everyone else went under. If that’s even true. Who knows anymore. This shit so fake no real mother fucker is out here condoning this shit. Music can be good for you if you don’t use it for evil. The thing is 99 percent of us like the evil. It’s cool. This shit ain’t cool. Played the fuck out
We can’t say he built like someone’s auntie anymore
He came not to play they say he skinny
Everybody’s paying attention for any content they can find….if that undeniable top 10 song don’t come out the next batch then just like this video…..he’ll be alone in that box….🫡
A fuccn 🐐 regardless the truth is in the pudding 🦍, look at the results👁️making money off hate and love 🤌🏾
All the bs surrounding him aside, you can’t deny good music. He came back and dropped some 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Free thug you rat 🐀
All y’all dick eating now he was just worser then 6ixnine doe 😂
Free young thug
YSL is still a label  the Album is Raw

Gunna ain't pushing p ,p be pushing gunna💯
I want a video for cash shit and definitely fukumean  he went 15 for 15
Bro don’t deserve the hate he gettin fam.. Coming from where a lot of this street shit is/gets validated, I just wish outsiders (ones who ain’t involved with the situation or crew) ain’t feel so included or felt like THEY need explanations.. Just enjoy the music & let them deal with theirs. Just listened to the album Outro “alright” and I’m just hoping everybody comes out cool on the other side of this..
🔥🔥
Don't let em' take yo shine💀🌻💛
He really make better music then Durk and baby they albums trash compared to the hype and support they got behind them
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Very Inspiring Keep It Up Gunna
I PRAY FOR GUNNA.

He should release a single music video for fukumean and rodeo dr, like both in the same video
Gunna  = Goat 🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Gunna ain’t letting nothing get in his way. He’s just getting started with his comeback. This just the beginning 💯🔥🎯🐐
You a snitch and a coward. Six 9, admit he rat and came home to a big bag. You can't even do that. 🍑🍑🍑
Will be a doc one day about one the biggest turnaround/come back stories on gunna. Album on repeat. Keep pushing 💪🏾
I STAMP THAT. THEY GONNA HATE WHEN THEY AGAINST  IT
The KING!!!🔥😍
he kinda looks like Future now that he's fit 😂😂
He borrowed the flow though, that ain't his flow (the humming sound)??
This song really gives me young thug vibes . Gunna is truly his prodigy
WOW!!
Glad Gunna is still dropping even with the haters. Always had a saying, haters are my motivators. Keep it up G 🔥
Nice video,new sound and nice look... fresh start 👏🏽

"BOUGHT A NEW WARDROBE BITCHES SAYING A NIGGA SKINNY  POCKETS STILL ON CHUBBY LORD KNOWS I GOTTA GET IT"  Jesus Christ gunna wunna 🔥
I Was Just Thinking
Wunna❤
Nigga got skinny asf
Its the media  creating the narrative who's say Jeffery didn't tell him to go handle business,  who too say  this  isn't all a part of the agendas. It's alot be going gotta read the between the lines ...he still shares  the same manager as Nayvadius which is Future and Future and Jeffery bros. JEFFERY keeping the bread flowing and business  is Business...someone gotta save the legacy...
He really in a box now they got him 😂🐀
WUNNA FAMILY 🏆
Fire ❤️‍🔥
Why this shit so hard
Still will continue to bump gunna nikkas really ain’t your friend till you up 🤧
i love you gunna through thick and thin
rodeo dr video next???
He can’t be stopped.  Mo dollars
Gunna lit 🔥
Kweku smoke
All these comments are crazy! He took a man away from his family forever. Imagine your brother robbing you then helping you look for it 🤦‍♂️. No morals and no loyalty . Free Young Thug ! This man in this video is a 🐀
He really dont need nobody he can do it all by himself 🔥
If you're going through these broke tough days alone, aint no need to have homies when you finaly get some bread.
Gunna on his skinny shii run ‘em up
Adversity makes strong men
rat
This reminds me of when everybody left cashmoney and Wayne drop Carter 2. He sound was more polished over different beats he usually doesn’t rap too. I think everyone turning their back will make Gunna even better!
Gunna is the best🔥🔥
Be you Gunna don’t fold keep it GOING 🔥🔥🔥🔥 we missed you bruh
Yes Ma'am
hey 🐁
One thing about me is that I'll drink my water and mind my bread.
Slime told him to get out and make money. If all the gang is in jail, whose going to feed them? Slime just can’t speak on it. That’s why he said this “this time around, they gone hate they went against it!”
free thung
Too many people that used to fail school with opinions that travel these days...
MANNNN THIS SHIT 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

WUNNA don’t need the industry!!!!😤😤😤
Shit weak
On top of the fact that Gunna came outta the box boxing & seems to be going for the KO, Good Quality music is gunna be hard to resist!!🔥✨️🏁
You said it was a gang though!!!! How you ant tell ??? You agreed too knowing about illegal activity within the gang . The song hard af can’t cap but you couldn’t stay down and do 3 or 4 years ?? They didn’t even really have nun on you fr. I’m js you a ganger banger regardless of if people say you not some aggressive street nigga you still took a oath . You supposed too do that time like it ant shit
Can’t be fucked with was a person !! One of them ones fasure 💛💛📌
Let's get it gunna💪🏿🔥
Man said dont say i told bitch u did tf but yall cosigning this but hate 6ix9ine 🤦🏾‍♂️
Nice one bro ❤❤❤❤❤
They can stop..  I see no young thug.. so how can he be trying be his clone ? ,🙄 Talent is Talent !!
nobody can really be mad at him it seems people that work 9 to 5 or live with mama in daddy at home or  behind a computer has more to say in their not even in the streets it’s effecting people lives that don’t live that life it’s weird it’s giving mental emotion but I support gunna
If you feel free standing out there with all your friends locked in jail, so you’re more than a rat 🐀
Slime Slide Slime 💚
Gunna feeling independent in this album
Ratboy sliding 😂
after everything he still making fire ass music 🧏‍♀🧏‍♀.
My favorite song from the album is Rodeo Dr

I can’t wait for this style to die out
Perfect timing

The best thing jail did for him was getting him in shape
🐀
He never was a gangsta I didn’t see him locked up
What’s up with that Spodee collab tape/album though
I fw this joint hard off the album… glad a visual came out!! Got the album on repeat no skips.. I’m just now tuning in but I fw it
such a talented rat. gotta respect it. 😂

Keep bussn bro, if thug was your homie, why snitch’n, i don’t think you did him nasty like that homie 🦾✅
🐀🐀🐀🐀
BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Was just thinking of snitching? Lol
Real Man take accountability for their actions Gunna you 💯 in my book Free Jeff Free YSL
still my favourite rapper in the game. stay true Wunna 🖤
Nobody cares about a snitch. We just want good music. Be a rapper not a gangster
Rat
Damn this video valid
I was suggested here from the song that’s called “Dupe - MOB” 👍🤤
But gunna my man, you did tell bro … I’m not sure what that bar is supposed to mean but you told bro. You answered those questions in court that the DA asked you so you could get out. You put thug in a terrible spot. You were his right hand man so when you said ysl was a gang and all that other shit you answered yes to, you told. Period. You went against the code. Plain and simple. Nothing to argue. You’re still a great artist that makes great music just cut the extra shit, you ain’t a solid dude.   Great song tho !
Even tho 90% of USA rappers are rats 🐀, Gunnatello, 69, Boston Snitchey etc. we here in Zimbabwe still love & support their music🔥
wtfff 😂😂
Say what you want but he’s talented.
Gunna for the win 🥇
that's on my top 3. GOAT
Buda tafuta collabo na Nyashinski, ni msanii mmoja mngori sana.
Wunna
Through all the hate Wunna still pushing to be great and not let any of it get to him. I wanna see how these rappers react when thugger say he’s not a snitch
I have no comment on his life or choices since I don't know him except that he's an artist named gunna, but I do love this song.
Wheezy needa apologize lol
Problem started when y'all thought a homies fate depends on the industry.. we listeners have the final say 🔥🔥
Wunna come back to South Africa for tour man 💯💯
One man taking over the music game? Now thats 🅿️
Trash asf tho like for real tho 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
He gave Wack content
Gunna came out of prison a different person. He rapping rapping, got fit, and wearing different clothes. Why people ain't saying he a clone lol
Not my type of music
he's been consistent with everything in this album. even his shoes!! 🤟🤟🤟
Eventually you gone gain weight while Jeffrey locked up 😢
I'm the here before a mili like button ❤🎉
My guyza 🔥
This my fav from the album💯👊🏾🔥🔥🔥
At first nilidhani ni nyashinski
Gunna should just quit rappin already ❌🧢
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ima always rock with gunna! 💪🏽 that new album hard 🔥 idc what nobody says
Yall like this music 😂😂😂😂😂 omg
i am 100 for show..... come on dawg
Music speaks for itself
Gunna trying to be like pop smoke
Talk yo shit 💯💪🏾fuck  them rumors
I know he feel so alone
That’s the guitar nigga from the live he did. bro is amazing
All this new music and shit y’all saying will never defeat the fact that he told🐀
Gunna the goat
6ix9ine walked so gunna could run 🐀
Y’all hood niggas need to realize there more to the world than living in the hood.  You POV is one of many but we out here living my boy.
Same flow 🚮
Gunna going hard 🔥🔥🔥
we watching someone with everybody against him still push through and drop the album of the year
Tht aint gunna ..nigga look dif ...lil babys son lookin ass .. dats a clone
Gunna looking ripped💪👀
I was against the snitching allegations but I had to realize I’m not a street dude and just a dude from the hood. So I don’t feel that bad listening to his music anymore lol.
Hit the like bottom who love this new guy 🏅⭐️⭐️
Gunna Wunna tell
Gunna been king drip tho. 🤷🏿‍♂️

So now ya support snitches?
Wunna Wunna will only go higher from here
gunna really called iso & went ona 15-0 run
GUNNA IS BACK 4 SURE❤❤
Bruh aint no way this abum better than durk album
Gunna is really inspiring me, he never stop no matter how tough his situation is right now, these are some of his attributes that help him survive in the industry. Who else can relate?❤
Apat from lil baby Gunna 10 times better than all those rappers with rap names  starting with 'lil '
Uh his only banger was the 1st one. All these are just a reach on the situation.
Nigga how is you out???
why does he sound like roddy ricch on this song
Something ain't right gunna still an og
"yeah I had copped out but don't let em say I told " I'm still waiting for if thug goes down.
Keep goin
Fucking 🔥 keep winning Ongod
Gunna back!!! 🙏🏿🙏🏿
🐀🐀
Gunna make good music for everyone here
🔥🔥🔥
He came back lyrical af
Clicking on EVER YouTube vid you post. We still love you Gunna! Need a tour soon.
i wonder if bruh had to scratch out all his old shit ina vault when he got home and rewrite all his words
niggas in Wyoming talm bout “he snitched” boaaa if y’all don’t stfu already mfs like snoop dogg done took the stand on mfs but y’all support . Just listen to the music or not
Why all his music videos are dark
All the industry niggas mad at gunna but the thing is none of them have the greatness that this nigga has to be presented with a way out and not take it. Thug knew that before and after y tf ppl think he signed him. He is thugs best fighting chance I mean he’s one of like 5 rappers in history to surpass their mentor/signee which again none of these other niggas have done so they just can’t understand. It hit different when u chosen
Yes ma’am
The album is very under appreciated
have to watch out for snitches like this, they are the worst. Had a codefendant who did the same thing got out and denied it just like buddy is here doing😂🤣🤣
So gifted 🐐🔥🔥but still a rat 🐀 slime still locked up cause of this man dope music though
The goat is back
Nbs gunna got the hardest shit out
Gunna flow is 💯
i’ve been super impressed w gunna lyrically since he’s been back
Gunna ain't snitched on me so fuck what ya'll say I'm turning up on this one
To all my young brothers is a enuff money out here get out the industry yall niggas bigger than these bitch ass label execs n they just using yall u guys could change the world but yall rather carry out the agenda gunna a snitch gunna this but reality gang its the labels trying to bend them to their will juss saying is all tabloids a big ass soap opera smh
