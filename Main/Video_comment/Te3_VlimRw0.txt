I'm playing this song for a few because they keep hurting me and I'm actually in physical pain at the moment unfortunately they seem a bit loud and messy at the moment a bit sloppy I'm very loudly paired by a lot without even realising what bandwagon they're on what reason they're fighting for I don't even think they realise what's going on themselves me personally I'm so different to a lot I don't know what you call it long story it's weird it's like my brain with trained different I walk out the door I can't see anything again I only looked at and just see beauty again as soon as I walk out that door and that's all I can encourage for others I can't do anything just so thought my videos and to others but I'm a little bit broken at the moment that's all hopefully that mess that they think they know what they're doing sort themselves out I can't keep suffering for this anymore
And yet there's only one shark. . . Should've been Shark
I am from guatemala I love your ❤music
You are wonderful.
this song gives me Vox from Hazbine hotel vibes

A fact did you realize that shark's have very weak jaws,, considering the size and density of them,, that's why they don't want to eat human the Bone density is to great ,and it exerts to much energy to consume considering they live amongst other predators and need to process the understanding of preservation,,they can crush bone but they eat so fast there jaws get tired they just lazy and don't like to chew food they swallow,,,😅😅😅,,,just kidding I made it up ,,but a bull shark doesn't GaF a bull shark will actually eat anything humans or even Winston Kimberly burnt buecuts😮,,, unfortunately I'm not a bull shark,,I'll eat whatever I can sink,,I may 🚫 not be capable to swim but I can dive deep and submerge in Granny pantry,,, with the jet stream,, go to sleep in china Waking up in Europe,,you know my game ,, ,❤❤❤ hello Chinese Mudda phuk ER love you princess,,take care of are Skyler ok ,, love you girls too 😅❤❤. Whale shark. 🌐⚜️🌐⚜️
Bro I’m dead ass pissed of that I’m just now finding out that this is just a normal music video and it’s not a movie? Like bro I thought this was from some dank ass film but no I was probably so drunk I thought this shit was a solid heist film of some shit
I love dit 🦈❤️‍🔥🎶🎤🎙🥁🎹🎸😊
My favorite song from Imagine Dragons for ever and ever ❤🦈
Ez is olyan lesz mint a Gulyás Geri. Nem tudok, nem láttam, miért engem kérdeznek stb. 😂😂 A másik meg. Fideszes birkáktól kemény kérdések? Ők a szart is élvezettel fogyasztják. Ahogy Kádár papától megtanulták. Fel se merül bennük hogy valami nincs rendben. Ami nekem oké, én már nem vitatkozom velük. Csak nekem ne keljen már megszavaznom hogy a szekér amin ülök tovább robogjon a szakadék felé.
this video is unbelivable silly lul

Love all of the Oceans 11-13 movie references in this.   Loving the song too.
Рейзор: не разбирается в людях. Не понимает их чувств.  Горо: генерал, который всегда лезет вперед. Хоть и добрый, но зависим от дела. Так что навещать и ухаживать он будет максимум раз в год.  Альхайтут: Слишком умный и прямолинейный. Использует людей максимум как питомцев или как объекты для исследования  Линни. Романтик, способный удивить любого. Прекрасно понимает человеческие чувства и способен на невероятно романтичные вещи. Хоть он и недоговаривает, но позже он раскаивался, что не сказал гг, что служит в Фатуи. Да и просто персонаж, с которым не одной девушки не будет скучно. Тут выбор очевиден

Sharks, Bones, Believer, Whatever It Takes, Follow You, Radioactive, Take Me To The Beach, Bad Liar, Natural and Enemy is basically the heart of imagine dragons  If it gets 67 likes I'm not gay😅
This song is apparently about gamblers who never understood the Three Fundamental Principles in the first place.  The Three Fundamental Principles of Gambling are: I. n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2)... * 1, which will only work if n is a positive integer. For a non-integer, the *gamma function* is required. II. nCr = n! / (n-r)!r!, n and r must be positive integers. III. nPr = n! / (n-r)!, n and r must be positive integers.
0:28  I ❤  sharks
I thought natural was good
The thing is in every fight jinx fought she was always using self-destructive methods or just lose the fight so she could die so we don't really know how strong she is when she isn't trying to die or something similar. But either way she's losing the fight.
Love the song!  The animated video is much better than this one though.  I get the Vegas angle but this made zero sense. I can listen to this on loop 🎉
That was quick and effective.
Your personality shines through.
Very inspiring video.
Buena 🎉🎉🎉

Meaning of "Sharks" by Imagine Dragons  **"Sharks"** by Imagine Dragons uses the metaphor of swimming with sharks to explore themes of trust, betrayal, and the dangers present in relationships and everyday life. Rather than referencing literal sharks, the song portrays "sharks" as people who are deceptive, selfish, or predatory—individuals who appear friendly but may turn on you when it suits their interests.  Main Themes  - Betrayal and Trust:   The lyrics highlight the fragility of relationships, conveying how people you consider friends can sometimes become adversaries. As the song points out, everyone is capable of selfish behavior, making it difficult to distinguish true friends from "sharks" lurking beneath the surface. - Self-Reflection:    The narrative isn't just accusatory; it also asks listeners to consider their own actions. The band suggests that everyone, at some point, can act like a shark—looking out for themselves, sometimes at the expense of others.  - Life’s Harsh Realities:     The song underscores the unpredictable and sometimes ruthless nature of the world. It encourages acceptance and resilience, advising to not dwell excessively on negativity but instead to laugh at the inevitabilities of life and move on.   - Irony and Humor:    Despite its dark themes, the band weaves in irony and a touch of humor, particularly in the chorus. This approach helps convey the message that, although life has its dangers and people can be untrustworthy, it's important not to take everything too seriously and to keep going with a sense of perspective.  Notable Lyrics & Imagery  - Lines like:   “You think they’re really your friends, but when it comes to the end, you’re just the same as them”;  point to the idea that everyone is capable of acting selfishly when pushed.  - The metaphor of:       “swimming with sharks” captures the tension and uncertainty of navigating relationships, where danger might not always be immediately visible.   - Choruses with:    “let it go—that’s the way that it goes… you’re swimming with sharks” remind us that ups and downs are a natural part of life, and hardships are inevitable.  Artist Commentary  Dan Reynolds, the band’s lead singer, explained that “Sharks” reflects the realization that the world is full of "sharks," but also invites listeners to ask themselves if they too, at times, act like a shark. Rather than taking a purely cynical view, he describes the song as striking a balance between dark self-reflection and laughing at life’s seriousness, suggesting that humor and self-awareness are ways to cope with these realities.  In summary, *Sharks* is a self-aware anthem about recognizing and dealing with toxic situations and people, understanding our own flaws, and finding a lighthearted way to move forward despite life’s dangers.

Why is she saying you can't rain from her in the chorus? She's NOT saying you can't run from me. So nobody try to correct me because she's not saying ruin. She's 100% saying rain which makes no sense. Listen to the song. She's not saying you can't run from her. There's absolutely an a she's using in that sentence. She isn't using the word u at all in the chorus.

Trouble, blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters, eat you alive Levels, better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil, butter to knife You think you're better than them, better than them You think they're really your friends, really your friends But when it comes to the end, to the end You're just the same as them, same as them So, let it go, let it go, that's the way that it goes First, you're in, then you're out, everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold, you're a light in the dark Just you wait, and you'll see that you're swimming with sharks He's comin' to get you Chick-chicka-whoop-whoop He's comin' to get you, get you Chicka-whoop Bubbles, drowning, you're seeing doubles Don't you let them see your struggles, hiding your tears Crisis, take advantage of your niceness Cut you up in even slices, prey on your fears You think you're better than them, better than them (you think you're better than them) You think they're really your friends, really your friends (really your friends) But when it comes to the end, to the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them, same as them So, let it go, let it go, that's the way that it goes (let it go) First, you're in, then you're out, everybody knows (first, you're in, then you're out) You're hot, then you're cold, you're a light in the dark Just you wait, and you'll see that you're swimming with sharks he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) chicka-whoop-whoop (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) get you he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) chicka-whoop-whoop (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) get you Every time my heart is beatin', I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is comin', blame it on the entropy My blood is pumpin', I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me, I could be everythin', everything (Sharks) Don't take it from me Blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks) Don't take it from me, I could be everythin', everything So, let it go, let it go, that's the way that it goes (let it go) First, you're in, then you're out, everybody knows (first, you're in, then you're out) You're hot, then you're cold, you're a light in the dark Just you wait, and you'll see that you're swimming with sharks he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) chicka-whoop-whoop (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) get you he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) get you

"Trouble, blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters, eat you alive Levels, better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil, butter to knife You think you're better than them, better than them You think they're really your friends, really your friends But when it comes to the end, to the end You're just the same as them, same as them So, let it go, let it go, that's the way that it goes First, you're in, then you're out, everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold, you're a light in the dark Just you wait, and you'll see that you're swimming with sharks He's comin' to get you Chick-chicka-whoop-whoop He's comin' to get you, get you Chicka-whoop Bubbles, drowning, you're seeing doubles Don't you let them see your struggles, hiding your tears Crisis, take advantage of your niceness Cut you up in even slices, prey on your fears You think you're better than them, better than them (you think you're better than them) You think they're really your friends, really your friends (really your friends) But when it comes to the end, to the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them, same as them So, let it go, let it go, that's the way that it goes (let it go) First, you're in, then you're out, everybody knows (first, you're in, then you're out) You're hot, then you're cold, you're a light in the dark Just you wait, and you'll see that you're swimming with sharks he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) chicka-whoop-whoop (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) get you he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) chicka-whoop-whoop (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) get you Every time my heart is beatin', I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is comin', blame it on the entropy My blood is pumpin', I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me, I could be everythin', everything (Sharks) Don't take it from me Blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks) Don't take it from me, I could be everythin', everything So, let it go, let it go, that's the way that it goes (let it go) First, you're in, then you're out, everybody knows (first, you're in, then you're out) You're hot, then you're cold, you're a light in the dark Just you wait, and you'll see that you're swimming with sharks he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) chicka-whoop-whoop (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) get you he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) get you" goes hard for real.

Mis bendiciones para todos los vocalistas del mundo y de sus bandas, solistas, intérpretes, etc. NO ES UN INSTRUMENTO, ES UN ÓRGANO HUMANO LA VOZ. No sean tan malos con los vocalistas que usan su voz durante más de 25 días al mes por sus shows o conciertos. Más respeto acerca de si suena igual en vivo. Ojo, también es necesario hacer vacaciones cada 2 meses en mi experiencia de 10 días para que el vocalista nuevamente lo tengas listo. 🎉

This song is one of my favorite songs
this is not  only THE best Imagine Dragons music vid, it also has an insane story. Like it follows a group of organized criminals in Vegas doing a heist of a casino, you can see easter eggs of their plan in the video if you look closely. The guy in the suit is also a criminal doing the main job, the person making is using sleeping aid to knock out a security guard and the woman throwing poker in the air is a distraction.
I just realized they're singing about life around casinos in Las Vegas. It's so vivid — being surrounded by people who are like sharks, driven solely by money. You have to give it everything you've got just to survive the race.
You made perfect sense I just don't know how you know all of this

قالوا ادع لنا ربك يبين لنا ما هي إن البقر تشابه علينا و إنا إن شاء الله لمهتدون ذالك جزيناهم بما كفروا و هل نجازي إلا الكفور طعام الأثيم كالمهل يغلي في البطون كغلي الحميم خذوه فاعتلوه إلى سواء الجحيم قل إن ربي يبسط الرزق لمن يشاء و يقدر و لكن أكثر الناس لا يعلمون و ما أموالكم و لا أولادكم بالتي تقربكم عندنا زلفىا إلا من ءامن و عمل  و بدا لهم سيءات ما كسبوا و حاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزءون فإذا مس الإنسان ضر دعانا ثم إذا خولناه نعمة منا قال إنما أوتيته على علم بل هي فتنة و لكن أكثرهم لا يعلمون إلا عجوزا في الغابرين ثم دمرنا الءاخرين و جعلنا النهار معاشا و بنينا فوقكم سبعا شدادا و جعلنا سراجا وهاجا ذالك جزاء أعداء الله النار لهم فيها دار الخلد جزاء بما كانوا بءاياتنا يجحدون كل نفس بما كسبت رهينة إلا أصحاب اليمين في جنات يتساءلون و ما كان لهم من أولياء ينصرونهم من دون الله و من يضلل الله فما له من سبيل الذين هم في خوض يلعبون يوم يدعون إلى نار جهنم دعاهن على الموسع قدره و على المقتر قدره متاعا بالمعروف حقا على المحسنين هو الذي يريكم ءاياته و ينزل لكم من السماء رزقا و ما يتذكر إلا من ينيب فادعوا الله مخلصين له الدين و لو كره الكافرونارحمنا أنت مولانا فانصرنا على القوم الكافرين و سارعوا إلى مغفرة من ربكم و جنة عرضها السماوات و الأرض أعدت للمتقين و اتبعوا أحسن ما أنزل إليكم من ربكم من قبل أن يأتيكم العذاب بغتة و أنتم لا تشعرونو لا تيمموا الخبيث منه تنفقون و لستم بءاخذيه إلا أن تغمضوا فيه و اعلموا أن الله غني حميد فلولا كان من القرون من قبلكم أولوا بقية ينهون عن الفساد في الأرض إلا قليلا ممن أنجينا منهم و اتبع الذين ظلموا ما أترفوا فيه و كانوا مجرمين و ما كان ربك ليهلك القرىا بظلم و أهلها مصلحون

Surreal seeing this take place minutes away from my place
I think this is my favorite song by them
“Sharks” Lyrics:    Trouble Blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters Eat you alive   Levels better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil Butter to knife   You think you're better than them, better than them You think they're really your friends, really your friends But when it comes to the end, to the end You're just the same as them, same as them   So let it go, let it go  That's the way that it goes First you're in then you're out, everybody knows You're hot then you're cold, you're a light in the dark Just you wait and you’ll see that you're swimming with sharks   He's coming to get you, he's coming to get you, get you   Bubbles, drowning you're seeing doubles Don't you let them see your struggles hiding your tears Crisis, take advantage of your niceness Cut you up in even slices Prey on your fears   You think you're better than them, better than them You think they're really your friends, really your friends But when it comes to the end, to the end You're just the same as them, same as them   So let it go, let it go  That's the way that it goes First you're in then you're out, everybody knows You're hot then you're cold, you're a light in the dark Just you wait and you’ll see that you're swimming with sharks   My blood is pumping, coming to get you, don't take it from me My blood is pumping, coming to get you, don't take it from me My blood is pumping, coming to get you, don't take it from me My blood is pumping, coming to get you, don't take it from me   Every time my heart is beating I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy My blood is pumping I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me I could be everything....everything   (don't take it from me) (my blood is pumping) (don't take it from me) (I could be everything....everything)   So let it go, let it go  That's the way that it goes First you're in then you're out, everybody knows You're hot then you're cold, you're a light in the dark Just you wait and you’ll see that you're swimming with sharks   My blood is pumping, coming to get you, don't take it from me My blood is pumping, coming to get you, don't take it from me My blood is pumping, coming to get you, don't take it from me   My blood is pumping, coming to get you, don't take it from me   #ImagineDragons​ #Sharks​ #Mercury​  Music video by Imagine Dragons performing Sharks. © 2022 KIDinaKORNER/Interscope Recordd

imagine dragons is my favorite band and  sharks is my favorite song by them so thank you!
I didn't know about this song until a few weeks ago when I saw Imagine Dragons live. OMG what a killer show. My brother is almost 50 and has seen many concerts ranging from punk rock to heavy metal to country and even he agreed that Imagine Dragons put on a great show. It's just over a month later and he's still gushing about it to his friends.
Just me
Something I just realized after 2 years of this video. What did they actually accomplish with the casino heist? Did they just let the sharks out into the fountain? We never actually see what pulling the lever did.
❤.

Oh my, my oh my, Imagine Dragons got my shady hater town on song & video of troll trap malicious food facility foul play 😉 I can't even! 🤣😂🤣... numerous are the times yuma az 85364 messed with my purchased food and beverages. Oh well, they can keep hatin' and sowing bad seeds of mistreatment, hurting feelings, intimidation schemes,, hidden agendas disguised as rag dragging, mopp opps, wet floor signs everywhere on dry floor set-ups, and cleaning ambushes.   My mental health PTSD increased as the opps mops raggedy, stalkers, hacker cyberbullies, bullies, and greedy hateful unappreciative can keep that misery and discontentment.   Their personal problem of jealous envy, not mine.  It's Their bad karma seeds they'll Reap, not mine.  I guess their tryin to recruit me to their misery, so I'll go to hate ungrateful Hell with them, and everybody they tryin tp drag down with em.  Ain't gone happen homies. I aint takin them hater troll traps baits.  They need to heal, and start bein thankful, so they don't live in hate envy greed misey straight to even mpre misery and eternal Hell.  That's on them thou.  It's Their consequence for their actions, behaviors, belief system's and way of choosing to navigate thru life. 2 choices. Invest in Heaven of peace and bliss or can expect to make their hatefulness a** to Hell with them and whatever miserable family or company they attempt to worry discourage and try to drag with them.  Bless their miserable troll trappen hater evil hidden agendas ignorant unrepentant unaccountable manipulative mocking stalking slandering lies gossip ignorant not considering consequences disfunctional demon filled brains and hearts☯️🌻 🙄 ❤️🙏  The Good News is; no haters nor wicked nor witches of spellwork casting magic manipulation control demon devil worshipers money hungry greedy jealous uglyness will not be given entry into Paridise Beautiful Perfect Eternal Peace Heaven with Jesus Christ and passed on loved ones ❤️ 1's, Heaven's VIP AFTER PARTY Celebration 🪅 🥳 🎊 🎉🥂 🍾 Cheers to  VIP HEAVEN 's Crew, keep the faith fellowship and praise with Jesus Christ and one another of peacemakers, helpers, contributers, the rewards of Heaven will be worth it!   To the haters, who will suffer beyond recognition in Hell, and be among hate satan and unforgiveness with each demon they loved hating with while alive. Aint no lov in Hell, nor passed loved ones who loved and faithfully had fellowship with Christ gon be there. Sorry. Forever seperated because they chose malicious hate, greed, and alternate materialistic vain shallow priorities other than Almighty Father God, of Unconditional Love, Provider, Defender, Protector, who continues to bless us with what we need. Not everything we want because Christ knows ahead of time what would be a hinderance rather than a Blessings. The haters, stalkers, cycerbullies, bullies, harrassment haters of control and manipulation selfish: always gimmy gimmy, greedy greedy, want want, more more, better better, no wonder they're bitter, unforgiving, unaccountable, Irresponsible, selfish, takers, liars like satan, satan father of lies, and evil intent for corruption and Deceit.   Guys and Gals, don't hate, Appreciate homies,  or expect to continue life and afterlife in misery thru sowing bad seeds and reaping bad harvest.  Bless all hearts. May the Peace of Jesus Christ be with all and heal to Stop hate and not end up in hell then stuck, so they unable to be included in forever peace Salvation Eternal restricted from Heaven.

i like the song but i don't understand the video? why does he go to all that trouble? what did that lever do? :))
Personal interpretation, (Yeah, after 2 year´s of the realese, sorry): Basically, the song talk to us about the hipocresy of the world, and how, we can beggining living whit person´s that have other intentions whitout any type of suspiece.  Let´s see, think that the musical video is about an infiltration mission, is very right, whit the intention of the lyrics, the world, and their hipocresy or double intetions, are represented as the shark´s, dangerous animals that hide in deep parts of the sea, that attacks when u are disapointed or not paying atention to where are u standed. . . Basically, a metaphor to the persons that have bad intentions whit u, or directly, only needs u to get their objective, later; Leaving u to your luck.  Talkin about the history of the musical video, can i say that is some obvious?  The objective is reveal the cassino as an secret animal trafficking center, principally acuatic animals, like the sharks.

Sharks
It think that this is probably their best music video. The lyrics video of this song could maybe take the title of best of his category as well.
That is all of it I guess..... 😅
this is probably my top 10 if not 5, one of the best song by imagine dragons.. the kinda whispered then turn to be emotion scream at the bridge is a god send part
why did the hair change from blond to brown ?!😖
Amo esta cansion❤
My comment will probably get lost but whoever reads this.. You got this! Whatever you are going through will get better hang in there
Whoop Whoop 🙌
Some of the lyrics in this song relates to my life YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN THEM,BETER THAN THEM, ''the girls in my class think they're the best'' YOU THINK THEY'RE REALLY YOUR FRIENDS,REALLY YOUR FRIENDS, ''my ex-bestie thinks those diva-queen girls are so cool that she left me and my other besties behind'' BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE END,TO THE END,YOU'RE JUST AS SAME AS THEM, SAME AS THEM. ''WHEN IT COMES TO EXAMS,THEY ALL FAIL.'' There's more where that came from,tell ya'll soon........

We solved a murder
I was wearing biggies jacket 😂
She was mad ......... I let my permit expire
After the tank was filled we switched ........
It wasn't my car
Let's just say I parked like a Nascar driver
Sorry were you guys expecting a car accident........
Yeah they saw me at the gas station they said i park like a douchebag 😂
👋👋👋👋
I broke a door with my toe 😂 sorry I was .......... frustrated
Why else would I be stuck here
He's probably hoping to catch me alone ........ then when he does he will hit me
Nothing new
Probably wants to hit me
No I saw him
the best song i ever heard
nice
The gates family made that movie ......... problem is I'm not American
No seriously........ theyve been caught theyre just pretending to be slick
Field day?
Yeah ........... how dumb do you think I am ..... first off the money in japan won't be valid without us
So what ???????? Am I the bait ? Then what? You throw a chair at me
What's on the menu ........ pavement and batons a real crew con en sah laddah
Mmmmm smells like the taste of idk a bite of concrete 😅🎉
Sally ????? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 wonder who owes him money
What can I say she was hungry
Bone apple teeth little bunny
Jojo rabbit 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 yeah pretty sure that's what's on the menu in Korea
Say my name 🎤 💧
My dad's best friend Dolph 😊

"When it comes to the end your the same as them." True! For one believer must understand that "He (Hashem) is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him."  The problem is some are up in there playing the Casino Game and other's are going about playing the Master Plan Game.  Who do you think gives better odds?  The Casino or G-d?
Super❤
BEST VID EVER!
This song was underrated
The choreography is the funniest shit I’ve seen. The way he gets through the fucking lasers and his little dance at the end sent me.

Am I  the one who's thinking that this is a samsung z fold commercial rather than a song?
Ich glaube es gibt einen nicht erklärbaren Grund warum ich plötzlich wieder auf Imagine Dragons gestoßen bin ❤ ich habe Dich einfach ausgeblendet und dann vergessen in meinem Drogenrausch.  Ja! So sieht die Wahrheit aus. Wahrheit tut weh. Eingestehen tut doppelt und dreifach weh!!! Thank you so much for your talent. It helps me give my self the chance to find freedom with my self and my demons thru your artistic music ❤

Claro, la Eneida es una obra monumental que ha ejercido una gran influencia en la literatura occidental. Escrita por Virgilio durante el reinado de Augusto, la epopeya combina elementos épicos, mitológicos y políticos para contar la historia de Eneas, un héroe troyano que, tras la caída de su ciudad, emprende un largo viaje que lo lleva a establecer las bases para la fundación de Roma.  La trama se desenvuelve en un contexto donde los dioses y semidioses juegan un papel crucial en el destino de los personajes. Además de Eneas, quien se destaca por su valentía y lealtad a su destino, encontramos a Dido, la reina de Cartago, cuyo trágico amor por Eneas desempeña un papel importante en la historia. Por otro lado, Turno, el rey Rutuliano, representa el conflicto bélico con el héroe troyano.  En cuanto a los dioses, la presencia de figuras como Júpiter (Zeus), Venus (Afrodita) y Neptuno (Poseidón) influye directamente en el desarrollo de los acontecimientos. Sus intervenciones divinas dan forma al destino de los personajes y a menudo desencadenan conflictos épicos.  La Eneida también presenta un bestiario mitológico fascinante que incluye criaturas como las arpías, los cíclopes y las furias, así como híbridos como los centauros y quimeras.  En resumen, la Eneida es una obra rica en personajes míticos que representan valores humanos universales y cuyas acciones están influenciadas por fuerzas divinas. Su legado perdura hasta nuestros días como una obra fundamental de la literatura clásica.  ¿Te gustaría saber más sobre algún aspecto en particular?

I don't understand why there's a trend to hate on this band. I appreciate how every song they release is a hit. With most bands, I only enjoy a handful of their songs, but this band consistently delivers great music. Thank you for always producing amazing tracks!

Imagine Dragons are one of the best things that has ever happened to humanity.
This song has such an awesome plot!
A Jew and a Gentile Sage who is also a righteous person are sitting around a bar one day.  The Jew says 'where is G-d?' the Gentile replies 'where is G-d Not?'..... This repeats for a bit there responding to each other such that is.   Eventually, they both look up from their dazed sleep... oh yeah! 'G-d is everywhere in everything'..... 'Even the hard matter like the t.v. and the keyboard' yes even the hard matter says the narrator as she floats away.... BOSTON!
Is it just me, or this one of her best works 🔥
Another great tune by these guys.

This is my favorite song🫠🥰🥰
This sound hits harder then stepping on the metal part of the rake and having the stick hit your face
Dan Reynolds is the greatest inspiration!!
Wow, wow, wow! It's mesmerizing! Imagine Dragons does not fail to make a banger, such a catchy and meaningful song, I love it! It's calling you out on your own behavior and selfishness. Everyone is a predator and they are looking for their own self-interest and this is something you should be aware of because you're no exception. Agh, I love how they portray this reality in this song and tell you to be carefree and just laugh it off because that's life.
I am leaving this comment just bc one day it will be in the top
Dan, you're the greatest, to have put so much of your life out for everyone to see, takes guts! you're one of my heroes for sure :D

Imagine dragons are a amazing band that produce many great songs, keep up the great work!!
I watched this video 10 times!!
I love this video!!😍
That lead singer is as hot as any leading man on the big screen. Great video...
For some reason I feel like this song should have been in the Bad Guys movie
💎💎💎✌🇦🇷
Y la forma en la es quiva
This is the best video I have ever seen, perhaps, ever! Nice job! Swimming with Sharks is cool.  I wonder if the video was made first and then they put words to it? Lol. They got enough cool songs, they can do it however they want. In the end, they know it's going to sound just fine.
With this much sleeping pills in coffee that old guard is dead. RIP unknown old guy, you will be missed.

Trouble Blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters Eat you alive Levels Better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil Butter to knife You think you're better than them Better than them You think they're really your friends Really your friends But when it comes to the end To the end You're just the same as them Same as them (ha ha ha ha ha) So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks He's comin' to get you (Chick, chicka) woo, woo He's comin' to get you, get (Chicka) woo Bubbles Drownin', you're seein' doubles Don't you let 'em see your struggles Hiding your tears Crisis Take advantage off your niceness Cut you up in even slices Prey on your fears You think you're better than them Better than them (you think you're better) You think they're really your friends Really your friends (really) But when it comes to the end To the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them Same as them (ha ha ha ha ha) So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows (ooh) You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) woo, woo (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you, get (Don't take it from me) (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) woo, woo (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you, get (Don't take it from me) Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything (Sharks) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks) Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) woo, woo (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you, get (Don't take it from me) (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) woo, woo (My blood is pumping) he's comin' to get you, get (Don't take it from me)

I take this song as "hey watch the people you keep around you. There are people out there that are "sharks" and you gotta pick and choose wisely. and tbh this song has opened my eyes a bit to the deception people give.

Hello. I was wondering if I could use your guys song for a video. The reason why I ask is so I can prevent being copyright claimed because if I didn't ask, my video would get Copyright claimed(I'm not trying to be rude in any way) If you say not I understand.
I love you guys
Good!

Okay, I agree just as much as the next guy that Imagine Dragons' songs are always a great. But, can we take a moment to realize what a cinematic masterpiece the actual film is. 15/10 to the film crew and directors.

Pháp luật có những hình phạt như vậy là quá là nhân từ rồi đấy chứ cho bạn giống tôi chắc là cụ tổ của bạn ,bạn cũng dám chém đấy
Việc nuôi vợ con và gia đình hay gì đấy không phải là điều gì nhỏ bé cả cùng với bạn tôi cũng là cháu trung tướng mà
Nhìn thế thôi chứ anh ta là phi công và chú anh ta là tổng thống ý nói đến thay đổi người khác là điều bất khả thi trong nghìn điều nhỏ bé nghịch cảnh là một món quà chứ không phải tôi không có gì để nuôi vợ con
Rồi là trong nghìn điều nhỏ bé nghịch cảnh là một món quà.rồi là vấn đề của trường dân tộc nội trú gần yên hòa
Bọn họ chẳng có chút thời gian nào cả ý là không biết đến tôi có tiền để có nhiều thời gian cho gia đình và người thân

They should wait 10 years and change their band name to "I see dragons". As for their bad songs: i can say that it is about taste versus quality, there are songs from them that are not on my taste but you can see the quality of their work.  What i really like about them, besides their songs, is the pedigree shown, the prove that this formation will be on same levels with the titans : the fact that they make covers of everything they like and sounds brilliant...
I totally love this song
❤❤❤❤desde Cuba

NEWSFLASH! -According to the Bible, God's elect are those who respond to His call and are chosen by Him12. The doctrine of predestination, as taught by Calvin, also speaks of God's elect1. The Bible does not mention two classes of Christians, but only the elect, whom God sovereignly chose in eternity to save through Jesus Christ2. The Bible does not instruct us to be concerned about our status of elect vs. non-elect, but rather calls us to believe and receive Jesus Christ as Savior3. The elect are sinners whom God has predestined to respond to the Gospel4. In different contexts, the Bible refers to God's elect as Jesus Christ, the people of Israel, those who inherit God's mountains or land, and those who inherit the new heavens and a new earth5. But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the depraved, the murderers, the sexually immoral, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and liars of every kind, their place is the fiery lake of burning sulfur, which is the second death.”[a] MY DEAR BROTHERS AND SISTERS PLEASE LEARN THAT I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OUT UNTO THE NAME OF GOD'S ELECT AND GOD'S PEOPLE FOR ALMOST 15 YEARS NOW BUT THE PEOPLE IN THE C.I.A. CHOOSE TO HIDE THE TRUTH OF OUR BELOVED LORD AND FATHER GOD HIMSELF FROM ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF FAITH OF THIS ENTIRE WORLD CURRENTLY AND AS HIS APPOINTED ANGEL MESSENGER THIS TIME I WILL HAVE TO WARN ALL OF YOU THAT THE WEST AND THAT THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ARE TRAITORS TO OUR BELOVED LORD JESUS CHRIST AND FATHER GOD THE LORD ALMIGHTY ELOHIM .YHWH. HIMSELF AND AS THE JUDGEMENT DAY AND THE END OF THIS VERY WORLD DRAWS NEAR I HAVE TO ENLIGHT YOU PEOPLE ABOUT THE GLORY OF OUR BELOVED LORD JESUS CHRIST THE SON OF GOD HIMSELF AND HOW HE SAVED THE ENTIRE HUMANITY AND THAT IS ALL BECAUSE THROUGH HIM MANKIND WILL ALWAYS HAVE THEIR PLACE UNTO THE HEAVENS AND EVERLASTING KINGDOM OF OUR BELOVED FATHER GOD HIMSELF THE CREATOR OF THIS WORLD AND THAT OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE AND BY THE POWER OF HIS SPIRIT. SO ALL OF YOU MUST LEARN WHY ALL OF THE HEAVENLY HOSTS OF ANGELS BELONG TO OUR BELOVED LORD JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF THIS TIME -AS FOR ALL OF THE FALLEN ANGELS, DEMONS WICKED PEOPLE AND SPIRIT ALIKE THERE WILL BE NO REFUGE FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE TO FACE THE WRATH OF THE ALMIGHTY FATHER GOD HIMSELF AND THEY WILL ULTIMATELY BE DESTROYED JUST AS FAR AS ALL PROPHECIES WILL BE DONE ACCORDING TO HIS WILL THIS TIME -AMEN!. SIGNED: THE ANGEL OF THE LORD HIMSELF AS IN YOUR FAVORITE ARCHANGEL BROTHER GABRIEL HIMSELF IN THE FLESH HERE NOW JUST AS FAR AS ALL PROPHECIES BROUGHT US SO FAR. I MEAN WHEN ARE YOU MONKEYS GONNA FIGURE OUT THAT YOU CAN'T KILL US. I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT LIKE THE SERAPHIM ANGELS OF FIRE WITH THE STRENGHT AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHERUBIM WHO IS LIKE THE HOLY ARCHANGEL MICHAEL HIMSELF HERE TO PUT AN END TO THE WICKEDNESS AND LIES OF THAT ANTICHRIST DEVIL BASTARD FILTH THE BAPHOMET HIMSELF SON OF THAT LILITH WHORE AND ALL THAT FOLLOW HIM BACK IN THAT DEVIL SAMAEL ARSE AND ALL THESE CHILDREN OF CAIN BASTARD WITH THE ENTIRE LGBTQ COMMUNITY BASTARDS.AMEN! - SO DON'T ACT LIKE YOUR THE KING OF ENGLAND AND CAN STOP ME YOU TRADING DOLLARS I'M MANAGING THE DESTINY OF YOUR SOULS LIKE IS MONETARY. SO LISTEN YOU STUPID SUN WORSHIPERS  KNOW THAT WE ALREADY BURIED ALL OF THEM SUMERIAN, ANCIENT EGYPTIAN AND BABYLONIAN FAKE GODS AND THEIR KINGS TO MANY TIMES BEFORE, SO I REALLY DO NOT CARE WHO WHO THE FUCK YOU THINK YOU ARE ON THIS EARTH NOW REALLY.
Always all the time 🕺🕺🕺

Hi imagine dragons! I want to ask you a question. So I really want to go to a concert of yours but their far away and the closest place where I can go to a concert of yours is LA but I have to pay for the flight, the hotel i'm going to stay in and for your concert and with all that i'm going to pay like a 1,000 dollars so if you can do a concert in San José California i'll really apretiate it. But if you can't its ok
I remember hearing this on the day it came out
Already a year old time flies 😢
this guy is me fr
❤❤❤
I pray that whoever reads this comment is having a good day. But if not, just remember… you are loved. No matter how much it seems like the world has left you to swim with the sharks, You Are Loved. Never forget that.
Ran across this song on the Live in Las Vegas concert on Hulu this afternoon. I’ve literally had it on repeat ever since. ❤ it!
Guys dont hate this band its just your opinion we think different. Like if you agree

I love this. It’s about the psychopaths and narcissists in the work place , (hide away your sons and daughters) because they are devoid of empathy and can exploit them and destroy them for life.  The clowns are the people pleasers. They look too tired yet are still complying. Trying to enter the sharks door is like walking on egg shells when communicating with these predators. <do not pull>  Meaning do not trigger them or set them off. As they will eat you alive and destroy your life.
Good song
UwU😖
So good. Idk, just so good.
re cheto amigo, ARTEEE PUROOO
After listen this song, go listen Time is running out of Muse
I just love that transitition from the strophe to this poignant "You think you're better than them!? Better than them?" and afterwards how the voice just becomes more sympathetic to "you", culminating in that self-admission.
I love they song

@eagercadet4059 3 месяца назад (изменено) Imagine Dragons is a rare band, they are unafraid to try a different style, Bands that stick to just one throughout their whole run are the ones that are most likely to fade into obscurity and stay there till they break up.  Meanwhile Imagine Dragons know that people get bored of hearing the same sounds over and over again and they arn't afraid to drop the guitars and

يو جست سيم ذام
بس كلشي ماسويت كضيته تصفن
البارحه سجلت بالجم حتى اصير بيق بوي
النبي محمد صح تزوج عائشه بس مدخل عليها يازربه
هذي سابين تعبد النيىk
ترى انتي ورام غثيثين اثنينكم نفس الزربه
اهوو كاعد يطلع لي يوزرات
والله السادس اسهل من الثالث
ياله عادي نحن مو رجال
هذي اول مره اسمع بيهه
مااريد اسمع مضرطه رام وخويانه
من يجون جيبوهم هنا
قايز مو قلنا نعاد نسب
وين البقيه
جالس تسمعون ايش جالس يقولون
ها
We free.. they were the king and queen of.. France.. and new Zealand and england

i love imagine dragons🥊
우주의 법칙 in love  광대한 우주에 있는 모든 법칙아래  3년을 내리 비한방울 내리지 않던곳의  씨앗 한알이 드디어 내린 빗방울에 눈물의 알곡을 맺는것과같이  신의 자비를 꿈꾸던  어린아이들의 영혼이 그의 곁으로 돌아가야할 순간 한해를 보내 추수의 계절을 앞둔 기쁨에 한껏 취한 모든 곡식들처럼  보내주신 그곳에서  이내 다음세대의 양식되어 태어나는 아이의  축복을 빌어주네.  어떠한 연유에 그곳에 솟은 바위는 작은 생명에게도 그자리를 허락하는가 바위사위로 움튼 새싹이 오늘도 즐거웁게 재잘거리고  가시밭길 위를 걷는 그리스도인들의 메마른 마음에도 일렁거리는 기쁨의  감사가 오늘하루도 일어날때  사랑 속의 우주의 법칙아래에  떠오르는 태양을 좇아  분주하게 뿌리내려 어느날의 발자욱 짙게 내 생명을 입증할때 거둔 그 숨결 신비로운 사랑으로 맺어 빛가운데 살아나리라.  이곳에 그의 나라가 임하시려니와 누가 먼저 그를 맞이 할까하냐만은 먼 하늘 우주속 먼지의 호흡조차 숨죽이며 그 가는길에 그분의 뜻이 함께하기를 바라는 것과 같이 모든 열정으로 세상을 사랑할지라. 사랑속에 법칙이 났으니 그것이 바로 우주의 법칙 일지니 빛나는 이유는 오직 그분만이 알것이로니 떠 순환하는 이유를 묻지 않은채 이곳에 존재함으로 감사할지라. 작은 가시라하더라도 어느곳의 살에 박히더라도 아픈것과 같이 모든 세포세포가 나로 정의 되는 것과같이 모든 아무개여 신에게 종속됨을  기뻐할지어다.  법칙이신 말씀을 듣지 아니하면 몸에 병드는 것과 같이 그분의 존재를 부정함이니 너는 생명되신 그분이 아닌 죽음으로 향함을 깨달아 알찌어다. 생명 그것이 그의 뜻하신 모든것의 법칙이 됨이니 너는 애써 속해 생명안에 거하라. 그의 정하신 법칙 말씀 속에 거하라.

Good song😊
The apotheosis of disgust! Go to work in the mine. How to make a song like yours? Put the word Thunder 1200 times and here's the song! Do we do Radioactive? 1200 times repeat Radioactive!  And they are ALL the same! The people must be deaf to listen to these 4 beggars!  What pity!
Imagine Dragons, we love you!!!
Still super proud of the small contribution of mine to this video. Such a cool project to be a part of!

I'm so glad fortnite showed me this song. Its awesome !!!!
Esta canción es a la vez futurista y retro. Es igualmente optimista e inquietante. Es sónicamente escaso y ampuloso al mismo tiempo. Son estas contradicciones las que la convierten en una de las mejores canciones de todos los tiempos, y también en una de mis favoritas de todos los tiempos.
Lyrics:  Trouble Blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters Eat you alive Levels Better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil Butter to knife  You think you're better than them Better than them You think they're really your friends Really your friends But when it comes to the end To the end You're just the same as them Same as them (ha ha ha ha ha)  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  He's comin' to get you (Chick, chicka) Woo, woo He's comin' to get you, get (Chicka) Woo  Bubbles Drownin', you're seein' doubles Don't you let 'em see your struggles Hiding your tears Crisis Take advantage off your niceness Cut you up in even slices Prey on your fears  You think you're better than them Better than them (you think you're better) You think they're really your friends Really your friends (really) But when it comes to the end To the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them Same as them (ha ha ha ha ha)  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows (ooh) You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  He's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) Woo, woo (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get (Don't take it from me) (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) Woo, woo (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get (Don't take it from me)  Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything (Sharks) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks) Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  He's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) Woo, woo (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get (Don't take it from me) (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you (Don't take it from me) Woo, woo (My blood is pumping) He's comin' to get you, get (Don't take it from me)

1:30  "Dick Dark"
All of your songs are amazing you are by far my favorite artists and the way you put stuff into the lyrics that relates to problems in the real world, like when you made the song enemy. you couldn't make a song I wouldn't like your amazing and I hope you make more songs for the entire world to enjoy.
Even tho I don’t understand thing from the lyrics but the song is a big hype.
the part from 2:14 is pure reminder of Jimmy Pops drummer from deafleprd

Every Imagine Dragon Song is so good! I love each one! Sharks , Bones, Enemy , and Machine are my top favorites. I have a question, who is the main singer of imagine dragons? Keep the good work going!
How about some bongos and a steel drum ?  Love you Imagine Dragons!!! Top Notch.
Is it just me? Or at the Lazer Part of the video it the same Night time dance from the Movie  The Pacifier with Vin diesel when he has to help put the little boy to sleep 😅? I swear those are the same movements.
Super Kendji😀👍Très jolie chanson, très entraînante. Super de chanter en espagnol par moments c'est une langue si chantante🎵🎶J'adore le passage de guitare à toute vitesse🥰 Hâte de la proposer à mes élèves🥰 Thomas, prof de piano de Metz.
The laser crossing is hilarious! 🤣🤣

I loved this song like all his songs
When you have the Midas touch !!!
As the sun began to set and the shadows grew longer, a young woman named Lily found herself walking down a dark and deserted street. She had been out running errands all day and was eager to return home, but something was off. She felt like she was being watched, and every time she turned around, she saw nothing but the empty street behind her. She quickened her pace, hoping to make it home before anything could happen to her.  As she walked, she heard a faint whisper in her ear, "It's coming to get you." She spun around, but once again, there was nothing there. Lily's heart raced as she tried to shake off the feeling of dread that had settled in her chest. She knew she had to keep moving, but her feet felt heavy, as if they were stuck in place.  Suddenly, she saw a figure emerge from the shadows. It was a woman, dressed in rags and with wild hair. Lily took a step back, but the woman stepped forward and spoke in a raspy voice, "Uh uh, hiding your tears."  Lily was taken aback. How did this woman know about her tears? She had been crying earlier, but she thought she had wiped away all evidence of her sadness. The woman continued, "You think you are better than them, but it's just the same as them."  Lily didn't understand what the woman meant. Who was she talking about? But before she could ask, the woman vanished into thin air, leaving Lily standing alone on the empty street.  Lily continued on her way home, her heart pounding in her chest. What did the woman mean? Who was "them"? And how did she know about Lily's tears? As she walked, she began to realize that the woman's words had hit a nerve. She had been feeling superior to others, thinking that she was better than them, but the truth was, she was just as vulnerable and human as anyone else. Her tears were proof of that.  By the time Lily arrived home, she had come to a realization. She couldn't let her pride and ego get in the way of her humanity. She needed to be kind and compassionate to others, even if they didn't always deserve it. And most importantly, she needed to allow herself to be vulnerable and ask for help when she needed it.  From that day forward, Lily approached life with a newfound humility and empathy. The strange encounter with the woman in the shadows had taught her a valuable lesson, one that
They planned out an operation, got everything arranged, trained themselves, and conducted an entire heist. To surf with sharks.  Hell yeah.

Imagine dragons replicated oceans 11, wolf of wallstreet as a music video lmao
This is why bass is my favorite instrument
Stupid song ,music like from 85..and someone kick his ball's..??
Os Imagine Dragons nunca me decepcionaram com suas músicas lindas🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤
Imagine Dragons is a rare band, they are unafraid to try a different style, Bands that stick to just one throughout their whole run are the ones that are most likely to fade into obscurity and stay there till they break up.  Meanwhile Imagine Dragons know that people get bored of hearing the same sounds over and over again and they arn't afraid to drop the guitars and drums for violions and saxophones every now and then, sure they may keep some aspects from before but just try and listen to their whole libray and tell me which songs stand out the best and what do they keep in common?  I'm very apprehensive to drinking alchohol and getting drunk but dam would I gladly down a bottle of Wine and get absolutley wasted to toast Them because much like Wine, They just get better with time, Heres to You Imagine Dragons!
This song is simply a masterpiece, let's take it to 1B views together.
fuckin awesome
I'm doing drum with this song
This should be a movie!!!!!!!!
Awesome
👍

Love the music this group has they been popular as hell since I was in elementary school
I love it that they don't have to depend on naked girls or degeneracy to get ppl to watch.  Their songs and themselves are strong enough to do it on their own. I can at least let my son watch comfortably and they have good messages in their songs. God bless them and keep them and give them all the success 💖💖💖

Guys. Someone please explain to me what this was all supposed to mean? The video is great! Amazing. But did he just get a whole bunch of people involved in a major breaking and entering just to turn on a bunch of water fountains?  What was the purpose?
whoop whoop

Whow!! I can"t stop hearing this song, Over and Over again, very loud🎧😂💃and dancing while driving
This is my favorite song from Imagine Dragons.  That's pretty impressive to be deep into their career and still producing home runs.  Does anybody know about the shark aquarium?  Is that actually at the casino?  Are the sharks actually in the fountain water?  Is that Caeser's or some other casino?

What the song is saying is that some people in the world aren’t nice and life isn’t fair
imagine dragons is the king of music
La canción de los psicópatas!!! ajjajajajajaja
Why?
Thank you for this vid! This got me thru MRI !
So lucky that Spotify literally recommended it to me right after its release
Soon we are going to see this song all over instagram 😂😂
I entered this song because it was a shark but it wasn't there it disappointed me
Udixh

Epic
Bro took swimming with sharks personally AND I LOVE ITTTTTT <<<33
Why choose to be a shark and prey on others when you could choose to be human and devour sharks for dinner?! 🤔
Amazing 😍
The fact that this song is a lecture of real life makes it even better.
Im going to make bones × sharks who needed that
:)
DrafTox, it's just mostly edit. But if you are saying the music it is good.
This is good i like it but they can do better....
Love from India ♥️

I hardly dare to say, but even as an adult man I think the music sounds really good.
This is amazing
Fajne
they allways make fire songs every year
honestly annoys me that people say imagine dragons is cringe just because its the bandwagon. Imagine dragons has always made good music and this is my new favorite.
Instructions unclear. Shark was not friendly. lost an arm
What is behind door number 2? I would really appreciate knowing that it is a magical door please tell me it is a magical door
I mean this is VERY TRUE once you get go deep into the dark web and shit like that you're just one of them and there are no friends only people to betray. So you can get to top nobody is your friend because if you had the option to be one of the Big Shots but you had to betray people a lot of people would do it. also a lot of people have their dark secret
another fantastic song of this band
muito booaaaaa
Better than them all this song🤩😎❤️a masterpiece
They Imagined The Dragons  🦞
Esto se puede bailar como una salsa
Marvelous ❤
Did they really just went to Paris to tape Dan riding a surf board in the lake??
Imagine dragons provando de tempos em tempos  que é  possível criar músicas boas sem apelar a palavrões e baixarias.
So Meaningful ✨️
Awesome

i like the spy them
Russian terrorists destroyed a residential building in Dnipro, Ukraine. 40 of them were killed, 12 children, 30 were missing, 72 were wounded. Tomorrow the Russian Nazis will come to your house and kill, rape and rob as in Ukraine.Don't be indifferent contact to their deputies to their government to give weapons to Ukraine. If Hitler had been stopped in Czechoslovakia or Poland there would have been no World War II. Let's stop Putin in Ukraine.

I have no friends, therefore I am not the same of anybody. Is it bliss or damnation?
Don t take the music from me never
They're so amazing
My birthday theme song! Happy 45 to me...
❤I love Imagine Dragons 😊f❤❤
🤍I can't stop replaying this song. I let it stay on Loop for like 3 hours?
Ignoring how great the song is, this video really puts into perspective how we treat actual sharks (among other animals); makes you really wonder which one is the true monster. I think that’s what helps paint the chilling tone of the song
Buena canción espero el concierto.saludos desde chile.
J'adore
✨🎼🌊🐉🎵💫🦈💫💦✨📿🙏🏾📿✨‼️
Life is a tragedy disguised in a huge joke of illusion...Great video, great song, love you !
I love you music

Hi. I am a huge fan of you. My first concert was when you guys went to jiffy lube live In August. I also want to the one at Capital one arena for the 25 anniversary. It would be a once in a lifetime to at least see you saw this. Thank you for everything. Imagine Dragons My name is Bentley
Some friends are sharks u can't believe in anybody's now a days.
Тело само танцует🔥❤️
Почему я только сейчас слушаю эту песню, добавлена в плейлист🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love this song. I also heard a mashup of this song with Bones. Check it out PPL
Brother of bones
Why does the thumbnail look like the backrooms

That's really me... I've been swimming with sharks for years and that too in the same water.. Foolish me, thinking that they're my friends!! Lol!

La musique est jolie

dang this so good i feel like wanting to have a will to live again
The vibes Imagine Dragon reflects is addicting
I was on a playlist, listened to bones first and then listened this directly. It was chilling to hear the bones end and sharks start on the same beats.
Now I just want someone to put all of ImagineDragons' music videos together and compile the story they find
This is a awesome song
all of that just to go surfing on the fountain, lmao
🥰😁😃🗿🍷
Juste  parfete
Love song  👏👏👏👏👏👏🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵
Mk but..Yes;)

Plagio de la línea de bajo de "Las de la intuición" de Shakira. Incluso la guitarra es muy parecida 🤨
When I was sad and depressed, Imagine Dragons helped me to overcome all these and now I'm a beast.

Yall, i know this got nothin to do with the song but i feel like someone is watching me, its a weird feeling, haha

fan de imagineDragons cuando se imagina un dragon:
Great song i real like this song .This song never gets old
Now 85 in 2023 on February 23 2023 i can't wait for it
Is the fullness due to doubled vocals? I know it's almost a given that every song has them, but it seems the strongest vocal parts that aren't chorus you can almost hear multiple of his voice.
cool
How does he even dodge that?
He makes very good songs no joke
eu amo imagine dragons(i love imagine dragons)

who can agree with me about how incredible this is? (aka VERY incredible)
The video creator said "21:9"
Everyone is talking about how good the song is, (I think it's amazing to, don't get me wrong.) But I'm confused as of what did they actually steal lol.

Las de intuición de Shakira???
Bro did they just pull of the casino heist?
👍🏻😸😸
hermosa canción 💞
WAU
At the beginning i thought what a great song but later on it just got meh. If you understand it is not like other songs like natural.wahtever it takes,bones, radioactive that you never get bored of them. I was bored easily of it idk why it just feels ordinary.
My favorite song.
Отличный клип и песня.
Thanks for existing guys

❤💫
I love "im so sorry" and "machine" 💚. Where are the old rock, ImagineDragons ?
Why the hell is nobody talking about the casino or whatever that room was, had an aquarium containing sharks and a lever to release those sharks in a river. Like what the hell was that even?
They just dont make songs,they make masterpices<3
imagine dragons...you've not failed to make good songs for like a decade. (also anyone notice the samsung z fold 4 and s pen cameo?)
you or city of new york and paris
Shot... This is 2 good 😢😍
Lyrics of what I heard:
2:45
The Beginning rhythm is so familiar to me  Do they have another song with this rhythm????
I LOVE SHARK
Since they’re from Las Vegas, it was inevitable that Imagine Dragons would film a music video on the Las Vegas strip and in one it’s casinos!  Hopefully the band members don’t have gambling problems.
I absolutly love this music. i remember being 7 and trying to sing the lyrics, since im Portuguese. hugs!!
Opposite of dirk dark.Late Light! I know okay!
i allllways enjoyed these laser beam scenes xD
Know one notices, this man has a amazing jawline
night at the beginning but day at end? still good song
The shark song that everybody and kid listen to: baby shark dodododo  The shark song that I'm listening to 🔥🔥🔥

I really like this song easily is stuck in my head but and the end I hate the pictures of the sharks but I was expecting it at some point
Lyrics:  Trouble Blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters Eat you alive Levels Better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil Butter to knife  You think you're better than them Better than them You think they're really your friends Really your friends But when it comes to the end To the end You're just the same as them Same as them  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  He's comin' to get you (woo-woo) He's comin' to get you, get you (woo)  Bubbles Drownin', you see in doubles Don't you let 'em see your struggles Hiding your tears Crisis Take advantage off your niceness Cut you up in even slices Prey on your fear  You think you're better than them Better than them (you think you're better) You think they're really your friends Really your friends (really) But when it comes to the end To the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them Same as them  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows (ooh) You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  My blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) My blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) My blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me  Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything! (Sharks) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks) Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything!  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  My blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) My blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me     ur welcome 🦈🏊🦈
diamond casino heist
I said this about this somg with the animation video.  I'm 59 and this is one of the best songs ever, regardless of genre.  Rock, pop, whatever...the lyrics just make you pay attention.  No jibberish, just pure talent.  Great work.
De plus en plus merdiques les ziks de ce groupe. Ils étaient bien au début en 2014 mais maintenant je peux plus me les dicav. Le chanteur un prétentieux fini qui fait le bagareur, le dur, style beauf. Bref qu'ils reste bien à Las Vegas.
1:01 is that you Howard Wolowitz
J'adore 😍😍😍
Love Music ❤❤❤❤
You are wonderful
So the point of the heist was to sneak into an underground area behind the theater's stage, dodge some lasers, and unleash some sharks into the ground-level fountain so that he can surf across the shark-infested fountain?  Personally, I think that it might have been better off with the first half of the song covering the heist, and the second half having everyone involved start betraying each other (your call whether you want one survivor or none), since that would match the theme of the song more than "some sharks randomly swimming in an underground tank beneath the Las Vegas strip".
Imagine Dragon's never lose🥰🤩👍
Who thinks imagine dragons is the best?
I'm leaving this comment here so after a month or a year when someone likes it, I get reminded of this song ❤️

I think this song with bones entered my the top 3 of the best songs ever
0:27 jajajaja webos XD
Probably nowadays you're one of the few current artists who are still able to compose Songs with the capital S. Your songs enter the mind for the rhythm at first and after for the lyrics. Sharks is my favourite of the most recent hits of yours. Excellent video. Nice job!! Greetings from Italy.

Trouble Blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters Eat you alive Levels Better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil Butter to knife  You think you're better than them Better than them You think they're really your friends Really your friends But when it comes to the end To the end You're just the same as them Same as them  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  He's comin' to get you (woo-woo) He's comin' to get you, get you (woo)  Bubbles Drownin', you see in doubles Don't you let 'em see your struggles Hiding your tears Crisis Take advantage off your niceness Cut you up in even slices Prey on your fear  You think you're better than them Better than them (you think you're better) You think they're really your friends Really your friends (really) But when it comes to the end To the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them Same as them  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows (ooh) You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me  Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything (Sharks) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks) Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me
The way he goes through the lazers😂 love it!!!!!!
Its all about society that exposes sooner or later, everyone just very selfish and fighting for money, and they can eat every their friend alive for a victory, but when it comes to the end, they are becoming victims of things they did too, and understand, that their life was empty. Combining with Bones, that talks about state of this personas fighting for better life makes it gold. It is so deep, and music decor is just perfect ✨
I don't know what people liked about this song.
Mediocre song, Mediocre singer! Phone ads, nothing more!
My friend from school was begging me to hear this song 😀
This guy's friends committed several felonies so he could surf with some sharks
Its beter to make a bad song
ximena
al principio pensé que estaba escuchando a Shakira con Las de la Intuición jajaja

Well done.  What was the lever for though?

ALGIEN NOTO LOS SAMSUNG Z FOL 4
He's comin' to get you (woo-woo) He's comin' to get you, get you (woo)   🎶🥰❤😍 IMAGINE DRAGONS SEMPRE VAI SER INCRÍVEL ❤
I wondered what this song could be about, and I found it's meaning... At least for me... "Your in, then your out, your hot then you cold, you are swimming with sharks"... It's a metaphor for friendships... One day you will be in, you will be on hotspot, you will be the man, next moment you will be out, you will be cold and you will understand that you are swimming with sharks... The faster we realize that we are all sharks, the better we will swim all together... Most of the time I found happiness in hanging with people, but now... I want to become a shark... Just you wait and you'll see that you're swimming with sharks... Great song
Very active song✨️✨️✨️
J'adore tout se qu'ils font🤗
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This band has great talent and a message in every song 🎵 👏. I'm 68 and listen and sing along everyday.  Tyvm for your wonderful meaningful music  🎶, I love it.
What the fuck this song
Song: Amazing! (But then again, you already knew that ;) ) Video: It’s great, but (and I know I might get hate for this) the lyrics video did better at capturing the vibe of this song than the official music video. Now, don’t get me wrong, I love this video, it’s great! But certain moments just don’t line up with the tone of the lyrics. (A good example of this is 2:14 - 2:30 in the vid, it’s honestly jarring) The official lyrics video on the other hand is amazing at capturing the tone and message of the song (at least, in my opinion) about how we mistreat others around us (using sharks as a example) to benefit ourselves. If you think this video is perfect in every way, then good for you! I can completely understand why you think that! I just don’t feel the same about this video. The song is amazing tho, 10/10
Dan Reyolds looking like the main man @Mark Goldbridge.
What is the music in the background called? I really like it
2:27 This scream was amazing and powerful I want more metal screams from Dan Reynolds in future songs please ♥️🤘  I know there was other metal screams in this album but this one is perfect.
Grandpa told me about Elvis Dad told me about Michael Jackson and soon I’ll tell my kids about Imagine Dragons
They have a new song called I don't like myself!
You are the mormon ir the apocalipsis?
You nevera danced with me... Darling...

"Crisis - Take advantage of your niceness. Cut you up in even slices. Prey on your fears."  In the middle of all the fearmongering that we've endured these last two years, this is the music that we need in 2022. Thank you, Imagine Dragons.

If imagine dragons made a bad song, the universe would collapse and we would all die.
Who is this song even made for? It reminds me of the noise my dog makes when he throws up; just terrible and annoying.

“6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,  7 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.  8 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.  9 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.  10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.  11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.  12 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.  13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.  14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.  15 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.”-Mark 5:6-15

I AM FROM INDIA BUT STILL my new favorite singer
Keep going.... don't listen to the sharks💯❤
Imagine dragons!!!!!! Get it...... ❤❤💯🤷‍♀️😁😫🖖😉🤙😜✌💪😁
song name?
Hi
THE BAST BAND EVER
por alguna razón el sonidito del inicio se parece al de las de la intuición de Shakira
al principio parece una shakira
It’s giving me Michael Jackson vibes and I LOVE IT
This may be my favourite music video
It's fraud because I'm not that person. Y and I
Gta?
They're definitely not sponsoring the Galaxy Z Fold 4
This is Art❤
lol bones is meh
Bellissima!!!!!!!!
Bar association is the sharks.  Trust me.
Cool song ever
Pretty funny to make a song about Sharks and film it in Vegas, home of the Golden Knights, whose biggest rivals are.... the Sharks.
incredible music ! I love it, I love it, I love it !!!
I was at the opener and only at your concert.
дякую за підримку тобі украіни

Зачем в узбекистане блокать видео
MY FAVE BAND
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥
True CHADS for  0% drugs and dancing women in bikini
I love how the music video is so Ocean’s 11 😄
Anything they touch is phenomenal ❤
Woah❤️🔥
Yo y los tiburones cuándo suena:
Bhot mast gaana hai hai bhai Love from India ❤️
While I'm new to the band, over the last couple years the have become half my pump up music. From "who" to big fan
Amei:)
It's impossible to hate imagine dragons ❤️❤️❤️
No seriously ImagineSharks🤣
É por isso que é minha banda favorita 🤌🏼❤
Ahhh 😍
Resumen del video a mi perspectiva: Todo empieza con el hombre de saco rojo ( no me acuerdo del nombre) conduciendo una motocicleta, luego en un cambio de escena se ve al mismo hombre viendo por una ventana y ahí empieza a cantar mientras va en camino a  un casino, en algunos momentos se puede ver al grupo de "cómplices" planeando cosas las cuales no entiendí bien pero bueno, hacen cosas de agentes en cubierto o algo por el estilo y el de saco rojo va un teatro que por razón alguna tiene acceso a un acuario. El del saco rojo le dió como antojo de nadar con tiburones y acciona una palanca que hace que los tiburones del acuario terminen en una fuente y el hombre al fin pudo nadar con sus queridos tiburones :3
Merci beaucoup !
Amazing
Cada canción tan pegadiza como siempre
Its the best song
E
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This song took everything literally he is swimming with sharks 🤣😂🤣😂
This song absolutely sucks.
Great
another very funny clip from imagine dragons
I like bones
This is so good! Heard this during a concert
that’s so true
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yeah you right The devil is coming to get you. Better be on fire for Jesus Christ or suffer Judgement with the rest of the world. Fallen angels are taking over NWO. Christians don't be lukewarm unless you want to suffer the great tribulation like the rest of the unbelievers.  May God help us all.
The song
I think they're underrated jst 'cz most of the people don't really get the great meaning/inference of their lyrics..nd its so sad they go behind those shit talking songs😮‍💨.
Eu quando a música saiu: aff q música chata, Imagine Dragons decepcionou dessa vez 🤨🤙🏼💔💔  Eu agora: SO LET IT GO, LET IT GO THAT'S THE WAY THAT IT GOES! JUST YOU WAIT AND YOU'LL SEE THAT YOU'RE SWIMMIN WHIT SHARKS! 😎🤙🏼🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈
All songs a Imagine Dragons is... a great❤❤❤

How in the hell your music gets on my profile look to hear from my lawyers man
Zelda is a boy and you play as him
My dad works for Bellagio and was wondering why someone was surfing in the fountains! Showed him this and he got a good kick out of it. Also so cool to see them run on the field I just saw them at!
whats your real name imagine dragons?
I love this music❤️
so... they created an elaborate plan, one that needed several people and for everything to go *perfectly,* just to... release some sharks into a public space... and... ride with them?
Everytime I am the only one Dancing with you .
wow. what a song !!
KHE PRO
Ma il significato del video?
Fun fact: The beginning of "Sharks" is the ending sound of "Bones":3
Jamais il n'existera une mauvaise chanson de ce groupe ❤️❤️
I see, its ad of new samsung
Damn straight,another fantastic song
That's home!!! Love the visuals and the music never disappoints
that is a really good song but imagine if everything happen in the real life , just kept me thinking about mission imposible

The first thing I do if I ever win/make a lot of money is hire Imagine Dragons for a private concert!!
El de rojo esta en los backrooms
Good song Sr.  You never do enny song whit an ather level 🔥 🎶 ✨ 💕 🙌 ❤ 🔥
I just realized that the end of the bones music video matches up with the beginning of this one and they go well if you swap the background music and melody as if it is meant to be like that so I think there is like a puzzle or something we might have to piece together. Or they match up together just because.
Единственная группа, которая до сих пор спустя столько лет радует своими отличнейшими песнями!!! Обожаю их!!!
este video musical me recuerda a la pelicula de la gran estafa
Tragam mais músicas agitadas como believer e enemy

I dreamt to go to your concert in Kyiv in June, bought tickets the first day the sale started, but the war in Ukraine didn't allow that dream come true. I believe that you will come to our peaceful country again when we win this war and we will be able to enjoy your performance.

ImagineDragonsDeezNutsInUr0mouth
❤️
Motivation to stay strong regardless of what is happening... Appreciate Imagine Dragons and their music more than they know!
A Songs Imagine Dragons is great!!!
For whatever reason, the video makes me feel like i am seeing agent 47 with hairs and friends..
❤❤
imagine they make a movie
Massive reference to the oceans movies
حق
Hagh
Você ouve mil vezes e que ouvir mais mil!!! Incrível como todas as músicas são únicas, tão diferentes entre si e provocam emoções diferentes, mas todas tem um "DNA" inconfundível... Os clipes parecem mini filmes... E os caras são sem frescura, são divertidos... Três "Dans" e um "Ben, caras, vcs são demais!!! SUCESSOOOOOO!!!!
Feel likes this could be a legit movie, I'd go see it. Name it after one of their songs too and make that the main songs that play in the movie too
What I like the most about imagine dragons is how every song sounds just like the one before it. It’s incredible, I really don’t like to be surprised by new things so the reliability of these songs to all sound the same is such a comfort to me! Nothing better than putting on some imagine dragons and a good ol cheeseburger! (Hold the mayo please it’s too spicy! Lol)
That guy just robbed the diamond casino and resort 💀
VAMO IMAGINE DRAGONS LOCO VAMO LOS PIBES imagine dragons no me desepciono nunca
Would be cooler if they’d dance latin dance , on 2:28 hot cha cha cha twists, slow down then drive wild 🔥

Anyone els who got enormis ‘Oceans 11/12’ vibes from the video clip? 😌  Ps: Great song, as allways! 🔥🤩
Wow this was cool!
When they're going to make bad songs, it's time for the apocalypse
i like everything on this song bass,treble and much more thank you for making music like this <3
I'm pretty sure this is the same bassline as Bones.
ok how much did samsung pay for that many fold cameos
Swe-vils? Really? Swivels and devils DO NOT rhyme!
Just like Muse's Time Is Running Out.
Normally I am a fan of imagine dragons but this song is bad and should be erased from existence!!!
The fact that they used real sharks to surf next to Dan
Fun fact sharks don’t attack humans  Otherwise incredible song
🇺🇦🇬🇧
THE BOYS.
Lo mejooor
🖤♡♥
Imagine dragons sono il top, mi sono innamorata di questa canzone
Why make a lever with "Do not pull" on it?
where is the green ecology ? everything is powered by electricity.

J'adore !!
Excelente banda, me entristece que no podré verlos en México, por el asunto de las dichosas pre-preventa a Banamex, y los que no tenemos esa opción ya nos dejan sin boletos, a parte del asunto de las reventas ilegales.

The last drop is the best

Matthew 7:5 James 2:20  Python Coding. Safe And Healthy Limits So that you don't fall into the abyss. Food for thought like food for your brain. Still Needs time to process -- for your brain. Digest for your stomach. If the info makes you think. It can feel like all you can eat tofu and or eating until you get sleepy with tofu and then it still does the tofu expanding thing in your stomach and or in your brain and or heart. And the last thing that you want is your body possibly turning on you. Sounding like owls screaming because it doesnt yet know what to do with it. All the extra food there is not yet anymore room to expand yet safely within you. Do you make for you yet within your own life. Do you allow yourself to count yourself in as a person; yet?! Do you make room for the Human Quotient side of you. Human Equality. Super Equity. Base, Mountain. Super Natural. Super Nature. How is your Emotional Forrest. Just a few collections of your Emotional Trees. Who are your roots, branches, trunks even leaves that clean the bacteria, spirit and soul?! What about your underground leaves. Look at the back of a leaf ... thats what it looks like underground; then, maybe. I have no real evidence to back it up I'm "Walking with Faith" -- My Cousin Rochelle. Keep The Faith (American Eagle Model Tattoo) Faith Evans. The Prince of Egypt. Really just start with your speck and counting yourself in, as a person. And often times the right ones may follow. But you'll have you and that is still true life living!!! True life wining. Tyler Perry's Made talks about roots and stuff. MTV's Teen Wolfs the Nematon is a tree with just roots. Still powerful but you need more. More from the tree. More from life. And thats still okay. Its okay to want more; sometimes. Anyways We grow. We grow in new places. New Roots new trees. "Good seed in good soil" -- Matthew, tHB. And as such New Roots new trees. In good soil. Youre slowly but surely building an Emotional Forrest. A home for your Emotional Self, Health And Overall Well Being. You Know. Nature is an Energy Giver. Treat Her Well and you may much a lot more from her. Same with Mr Univeerse. But no one likes being used. Backwards bicycle handles. It can make turning harder. Right Direction, Wrong Way?!?! Environmental Pollution can fxxk up nature which can in turn possibly fxxk up your overall well being. Possibly fxxk'N Natures Magic Energy Giving. As such possibly fxxk up the overall and or partial supernatural beings. You Know. Sometimes it is not just you. Sometimes it is your environment. Even DJs have a DJ Booth. Where is your booth? Bones. The Bones By Hozier ft Marren Morris. (Hozier ft M&M, Eminem). 8 Mile Starter Track. Growth Mindset Carol Dsweck Book Inspo. Use your head but dont just rely on it. Trust your other senses too. Diversify Diversify Diversify, Mind Body Spirit Soul, Feelings (Emotions), The Heart. Location, Location, Location. But First your Speck. M75. Divide b4 you multiply BEDMAS. Da Matts. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.
Best thing of their songs is they don't use bad words..I love every songs of them
Ikr
Imagine Dragons if you see this comment does know that it’s a lifestyle our your song is mad fire mad fire
Troubles blows in the Rocky waters
Is it just me or does this video give off Ocean's Eleven vibes
This was totally a paid ad by samsung
"bE Bold Like A Lion" -- tHB.  Taylor Swift - Look What You Made Me Do https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmd-ClpJxA&list=RDoafEYZ1QGso&index=3 Hey the anniversary for this was just the other day!!! Im so sorry. Happy Belated Anniversary!!!!  Sincerley , aNGEL oF dEATH. gOD's aNGEL oF dEATH. Look What you made me/ Look what you just made me do look what you  made me do. Got a new job working 12  days a week straight to account for include  training got my period called in sick on the  8th and 9th day. Monday and Tuesday.  Demon and or Angel sent into work on  a sick day. No I take my sick days now. I  dont have to be super sick to call in now.  I wont just soldier on and bear through it  for the work for the office. I take care of me  first now. Fallen Angel all black Demon, no.  Ashened. Tamar Ashened. All black long sleeve pants, sneakers and wings. The Angel of Death. The Host. The Beauty Behind the Madness.

Summoning a Demon is forcing someone to come in on their sick day. Do you love them and or the use of them.  Who are they when are healthy?!?! Can you love them whole and healthy!?!?! ... yet!??!!? Sometimes you put cucumber water in a seperate basin for when  you soak your feet. #pedacures. Youve got to take care of your feet. Especially  working in retail the souls of your feet. But also when healing and or especially  in preparing for battle the achilles tendon of your feet, you know. Do you love  yourself enough yet to allow yourself to better later show up whole and healthy; yet!?!?!? Slow and steady. Direction over speed. ;). Love what you just made me do. Look what you just made me do look what you made me do. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.

my new favorite song by imagine dragons in my opinion
Erra nunca
Let's have a moment of silence for all those people who haven't yet found this song
It's real good, I take back some of this shit I talked about this group. I actually kind of like them more and more lately. Fun Easter Eggs too.
So good form THAILAND🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
Matthew 7:5 James 2:20  What if There, Law And Order: SVU — Toddlers Edition!??!!?    Muddy Boats And or Red Bottoms?!?! KOD Middle Child.   What is there is Law And Order: SVU at the daycare but between the kids!??!? The Toddlers!?!?!?!  How do you explain and try and be a voice advocate to the kids without ending up as and or in part of the kiddy p*rn industry!??!?  How will // might kids who get raped at such a young age try adn understand what happened to them then now without possibly ending up back there and or without slipping into that industry1!?!?!   If you dont’ even yet fully understand it and you didnt hopefully didnt go through it then how will the kids who did go through it with the emotions of having gone through and hopefully done some inner work to grow through it. Get some better understanding from their past in  oder to better grow through // past // out of it??!?!?!?   And thats without all the emotions of potentially spinning a knife through their hearts trying to find a possible solutions like trying to spin a ladle in soup.   It doesn’t need to get bad to worst if we can speak about bad correctly.  At least then we can have some better baseline foundations for if// if we should ever get caught up in the rapture and or currents of life. That might take us back to our trauma but their ground and so now you can become just part of the problem.   Sometimes you are not just to fetishize or to be fascinated but to be there to grow through what you have already gone through.   When looking at your past home videos could even send you to jail how do you heal from even having been originally on them to begin with!?!?!? Look at Bonnie from How To Get Away With Murder. Did you heard about that part of her origin story.   She still grew out of it but she still needs to do some more inner work healing.   And these are the things that people dont wanna yet talk about and or can get swept underneath the rug from people just all around not wanting to yet completely and or partially — even with just the parts that we can handle — talk about. Truth for truths, truths for safe and healthy ventilation, truths for // towards solutions. Truths for better safer and healthier systems growing // going forward you know.    Sweetest Pie brought to you by upp!!! Up Cardi B. Sweetest Pie by Meg Thee Stallion ft Dua Lipa. Is the shoes just covered in plastic at and or in the begging to see where others who try to walk in your shoes actually do!!! So they show themselves. So that you can see everyone just trying to see one. Are the shoes covered the way that the couch is; then!?!!??!?! Is the couch gonna look dirty after all y'all sitting on if if it is still covered while y'all sitting down!??!!? I mean your friends shoes are dirty but maybe he doesnt care when walking around mud. Also sometimes parents clean everything when they know that their kids may put almost anything in their mouths. You ever work at a Daycare!?!? You ever work and or live when their are toddlers around!??!?! Youve got to learn how to work help how the system works when things are bad not just worst you know. Like if SSW things (Judging Amy Social Service Workers TV Show Inspo) and or Law and order: SVU things happened in your daycare do you have a healthy and good system in place not just for if kids break there teeth but if they should get sexually assualted and or violated. Sexual Violation if you dont know if it molestation -- finger blasted without permission and or any hands touching private parts groping without permission between kids and or between kids and adults without permission and or too young to consent. And or way past the limits healthy and safe limits of the consent. Like blasted past a safe zone. No. Or rape penetatration in either direction without permission. How do you teach the kids ahead of time. Protect the kids. Help the kids best be able to protect themselves. But also how do you help them recover afterwards. WE need better recovery system, in general overall and as well as specifically for kids pre post and during sexual assault. How to speak up, break apart, how to best stop it without causing trauma. Obviously time is of the essence so that should be the last of your worries. But if you have the time. Btu if you can have the time how can you have better solutions to ending a possible sexual assault without causing any added trauma. And sometimes these kids are 2 and 5 who are being assaulted. If talking about child sexual assault is uncomfortable to you. Then how do you think the kids actually being and or enduring the sexual assault is gonna feel. You cannot rely on the victims to speak up when you not always being a victim and or survivor is uncomfortable for you. Start with your speck you know. Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 Prayer Needs Work. But someone has to get it so that you dont possibly get lost in the rabbit hole. So that you dont possibly end up in the wrong side of a group that you were dragged into kicking and screaming you know. I dont know. Yeah I do. Hope that helps you. And to a better post recovery system. Eminems Recovery Album that is exactly what you see when you when you know somebody is watching you from behind you. But doesnt want you to turn around. Shout out to the bonfire hearts in the world. When you are not yet sure if they are hear to help you or harm you or scare you so you just say fxxk it and go straight. And go your own way. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.
hi
Amazing song, this brings out the best in the band.
I love you Enemy Song
Can I just say iv always been a fan but I don't know to much about them just like that dude said it's impossible for them to make a bad song. I think the lead singer is an absolute monster and he has aged well guy looks good
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I WANNA GO TO ONE OF THEIR CONCERTS BUT THEY WON'T BE COMING TO CANADA and i do not have the money to see them in concert rn i'd do anything to see them in concert i love all their songs they are always amazing
My favorite scene is the one with the security lasers.  The dance is so awesome and the best part is his decisive nod at the end like he is saying, "And that is how you do it folks."  LOL
count me in for this heist
How many times have you watched this  Me: yes
I am from vietnames ilove ImagineDragons
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its hard for imagindragons to make a bad song ❤️
To me the security guy that was asleep reminded me of my mom. 😂
He is old fine wine getting better with age and making us feel blessed ....
Woow❤
I think that my first ever imagine dragons song I have ever heard was it time. This is my second favorite band next two linkin park.
Love it'...
And scream
This is Victory is good miusic
I cant understand this music video
This is by far my fav band too band ticket prices have gone through the roof..sigh
Estuve aquí

I AM PRETTY HANDSOME
DAN IS MY HUSBAND.
DAN IS HANDSOME

❤️  🤟
No words to say, its just so cool
Sharks is a song in a teaser of new Sharknado
I forgot what i will say
Sharks is a song made by Imagine Dragons from the álbum Mercury act 2
Brock Lesnar already make a F5 in a Shark
I am the King of comments
I don't know what is better the lyric video or this video
RATATATATATARATATATA
Sharks and no time for Toxic People, the two best songs of Act 1 and 2
Sharks the best of Act 2
Imagine Dragons is a band of Pop Rock created in USA
Non ne sbagliano una!! Troppo bravi..♥️
Pink Venom is great
Sharks is better than Bones
Sharks is about Sharknado
There's no good song in 2022 like Sharks
The best of 2022
Dan’s scream. That is all
Love
What'd you SAID
😃🥳😎🎵🎶
I am fan from Egypt 🇪🇬 ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Best song
Antes de salir a trabajar, es mi tema preferido...😂
No se pero el sonido del bajo me recuerda a una canción de Shakira
ude i love tihs music video
🇦🇴🇦🇴🇦🇴
Oceans 7 but it's a music video
Went to the imagine dragons concert last night in Chicago, and it was truly amazing! The fact that they performed live just as well as their albums shows how talented they truly are.
*Thanks for support Ukraine!🇺🇦*
I really like the songs of Imagine Dragons. Each song is better and more beautiful than the other.
🤩♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
This guy sounds like CG5 lol
I can't think of another band that I could just listen to every song and not feel like they could have done better.
It my best song of world
truoble ajr
👍
Melhor música! Por algum motivo me identifiquei kkkk.
I got copyright claimed for “using this song” but I used enemy but it got confused to this I’m not hating it’s a good song
What i like about this is not just the beat and lyrics but the hidden message within it. It talks about the world of selfish people taking advantage of others just like "sharks". Main reason why i love the songs of imagine dragons its not just about the tone beat and lyrics, its about the hidden message within the song
2:15 DAN'S DAMNNNN FUCK AWESOME
I JUST FUCKING LOVE THIS SONG IT'S BEEN OVER 2MONTHS ALREADY !!!!!!AAAAAAAAAAaAaAAaaaaaaaaaaa
Super fixe
My favorite
I very very like
The story is always interesting
mãi yêu🥰
this song is so flepin bad and it's so dam bad man
The Best Song♥️
Imagine Dragons these nuts
i like
All Imagine songs are great
good beat ;) 0:17
I wonder if it is possible for ImagineDragons to make a bad song? I end up having every song on loop for hours😅
I love this song <3
Agreed
Não erram nunca cara
what are swivels :(
grew up in a cage  still carrying my 4 birds safe and until alive 4 birds are my siblings All summed up, i just wants to give them and myself a good and normal life
I gotta fan of imagine Dragons when I was listened the Believer song man I'm fan
YES! Soooo TRUE! It's been shark week all Summer.
I went the concert it ese soo cool
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Gut es Lied👍👍👍👍👍👍
Ohhh, that video is so great and so funny at once. <3 That parody of laser-scene from action movies is gold <3 Music is like always. Just... Saying "amazing" is so underestimating... I'm back here now and then to listen. Always it's just hypnotising.
nota 10000000...
Esta é a minha banda preferida
The beginning sounds like cod zombies lol
Omgg Imagine Dragons loveee you so much ✨♥♥

ชอบมาก ฟังทุกวัน ฟังทั้งวัน 🥰

I looooooooove this video. It looks so serious like an 007, but there is always that unique sense of humor. That´s why it is so great!!!
lol
I AM  10000 COMMENT
10k pog
literally osmm that whop whop are another level
Lol y’all’s generation has horrible music and we feel sorry for you guys listening to this very limited performer. The 70/80s guys and gals were amazing real musicians who played clear and great singers that had amazing voices!! Versus the last 20years of talentless groups with childish sound effects and toddler pronunciation of words is cringing. Research real bands of any genre and the Amoy of talent is endless. Start with more than a feeling by Boston.  Then be lead by the other hundreds of greats.  Then you will be awoken and taught these computer guys today are EXPOSED BAD

When a new song from you is released, I don't have to worry about quality. You're perfect 😍
Is litterally no one going to comment on how awesome the actual video is?
my hubby said he if John Cena and Mark Wahlberg had a love child I Can't Unsee that now
Hurray Guraaaa
increible cancion, imagine dragons deberian ser eternos

I've known this band for years and they still make absolutely amazing music. I'm so happy. ~Wipes away single tear~
van a venir a Bogota alvvvvvvv
A música é boa, isso todos concordamos, agora... o clipe todo bem produzido, mas sem conclusão ou eu que não peguei o final, porque o Dan Reynolds faz todo um plano gigantesco, droga um segurança, passa por um corredor cheio de lazers, pra no final mudar uma alavanca e depois o quê? Vai 'surfar' na fonte do MGM Resorts International com tubarões (????)
Спасибо за поддержку Украины 💙💛
que no se note la promoción con samsung
Man if we had this song back when Ocean's 11 first came out...
My favorite song of the imagen dragons
Adorei essa imagine dragons ✌️

Before it's too late *Romans 10:9* If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised HIM from the dead, *YOU WILL BE SAVED*
Imagine Dragons can switch on another genre and still make good music
The beat is so unique I love it. 👍

You can respect other people decisions without having to do// and or follow through with it yourself!!!!!!!  Are you respecting someones gender and preferred pronouns; yet? And or projecting, passing down possible generational trauma, or just flat out abusing someone? And if so why???    Matthew 7:5 James 2:20   She is not comfortable in that. Being a guy. Possibly being tomboy doesnt always mean that somebody wants to be a guy. Purposefully dressing a kid as and addressing them as the opposite gender is trauma. Its like misgendering and using a dead name after transition. Its actually that. On both accounts its wrong. Youre not respecting someones gender, preferred pronouns, and or bodily autonomy.   Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.    “Do Not Embrace Ignorance” — tHB.

Yoo how much did their record label pay for these positive comments hahahah I thought this was a meme for Shark Week
Fack
I love this song🥰❤🦈
ive liked imagine dragons since i was like 5 years old so over 7 years now i made a playlist called best of imagine dragons i follow you on all social media platforms (not tiktok). Ive always wondered if anyone else like you or not but they always listen to popular music like olivia rodrigo was so popular last year but in quarentine all i listened to was you ❤.  I absolutely adore the new albums (mercury act 1 and 2). it would mean the world to me if you saw this comment ❤.  ❤❤❤
Los amooooooooo!!! 😍😍😍😍
you know, I went to their concert yesterday, and I remember Dan talking about first making the beat and it had "chicka boom" during the chorus part when he was thinking about it. He told everyone that he kept it in, cuz he was a 90s kid and he thought it would be cool because it incorporated some of his story. Keep it up imagine dragons ;)

Do Techno Blades theme song
It’s not even the song that’s good it’s even the vid itself
Matthew 7:5 James 2:20  My Mom used to teach me business lessons. She was the one who initially originally taught me math. Math classes, tutoring sessions, math lessons. Those lessons. The BEDMAS, The Parent Functions, The Asymptotes Around My Traumas, The 0.01 around trauma, The Walking with Fatih for the booklets with Calculus and Vetors. Learning how not to carry everything when studying. Just what you need. Work it a little bit at a time. Its easier on my back. Yeah she taught me alot. The start of almost everything. Really helped me with my inner growth. And Healing. Especially when in terms of living, growing and as well as healing towards with my traumas. And Keeping the metronome I learned in the music rooms. The outskirts. They used to make music in the music industry with my Dad. They really set me up right. A lot of this, just what Ive learned is from good seeds. Positioning yourself well for good life lessons. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.  Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 My Mom used to teach me business stuff like business stuff like this when I was little. She was all "This is my bond and this is my equity. You put them together adn you get a fixed income tax". She used to say that when she was teaching me how to fight. Left Fist, Right Fist and you put up together knock out. She taught me business skills. Shes really good at it. She used to do trade penny stocks. I made an account but I cannot remember where it is. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.
Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 Butter Knifes Do Not Slice Your Index Finger Open When Trying To Cut Hot Dogs As A Kid. With Your Older Sister Watching Over You. Not Stopping Shit. 😑. Like What Are You Tried?!?!?! How are you so this out of it. I dont know about you but I glued that deep cut back together with Denture Glue. No Lie though I probably should have had some stitches. But seeing as my family didnt really do hospitals back then. And thats the second time that I needed stitches and didnt yet get them. I did what I had to to survive. Not that much of a scar. Life Lessons. You dont always need to cut everything with a sharp steak knife. Sometimes a butterknife with do to tighten the screws. Its about not losing fingers while trying to make some homemade food. Are sliced hot dogs in the microwave considered homemade food; yet!!?!?!? Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.
Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 Save Myself -- Ed Sheeran Divide. Are You Playing Peter!?!?!?! ??? I just go Christian Philosophy. Id rather debate the rules. Look at the history to make a better future. Like real History. Socrates Like Jay Z. But for when you are cocooned within cHRIST. Christ Street Living. The Church Outside of the church. Thats all Im saying. My speck. As well with the fact of not sleeping on my own abilities. The Able of the second testament. 1st to 2nd Testament, Foreshadowing. 🙂 ❤! I wear Neon. I cannot// I chose to not be that incognito. 😉 Bubbly Tights. With the black and yellow strips. Wiz Khalifa Remix it. Audi. Transporters. Go Get It.Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.

We’re a ginormous pod of Blue 🐳s❗️ We LAUGH at sharks, endangered yet protected, by Divine Authority⚡️🔥👼🏻
Don’t wanna bother anyone but this song sounds v e r y familiar as  „Przezroczysty świat” from polish band Kwiat Jabłoni  Their song came out in February 2021.  Sharks came out a month ago. Say what you want but people should know about this.
.........
Now I really want to buy the Fold :v
Is it just me or is this spronsered by the flip phone thing like in recent kdramas
its impossible to imagine, imagine dragons made a bad song.🤍🤍🤍
So underated
😍😍😍😘Just the best
is it just me or is imagine dragons getting worse :p
What are sharks versus dragons? 😉 don't chase. More of us than them. The man who sold the world.
I honestly dont even know if Imagine Dragons have ever released a bad song! I don't think any other bands out there have that claim
Love that the motif sounds like Bones
Amazing song
Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 "Do Not Embrace Ignorance" -- tHB.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te3_VlimRw0 1:40 Imagine Dragons - Sharks (Official Music Video) How did nobody see the sexual violation caught on camera. Between a 5 year old and a two year old toddler. There were cameras everywhere!!!!! If you are gonna block out your own camera person then youve got to put in your very own security!!! Best, X.

Trouble Blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters Eat you alive Levels Better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil Butter to knife You think you're better than them Better than them You think they're really your friends Really your friends But when it comes to the end To the end You're just the same as them Same as them So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks He's comin' to get you (woo-woo) He's comin' to get you, get you (woo) Bubbles Drownin', you see in doubles Don't you let 'em see your struggles Hiding your tears Crisis Take advantage off your niceness Cut you up in even slices Prey on your fear You think you're better than them Better than them (you think you're better) You think they're really your friends Really your friends (really) But when it comes to the end To the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them Same as them So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows (ooh) You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything (Sharks) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks) Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me

achei uma vibe Luther de the umbrella  academy  sla
I love this
he sings all over the place, switching keys, out of tune. its garbage. this is garbage.
imagine dragons, more like "shit dragons"
I'm from Belarus, love this song, but I can't listen to it without VPN on because it is blocked in our country. WHY????? This is not fair!
Mi top N°1 Es Imagine dragons
es increible que apesar de que muchos lo critican mantienen su postura de no agregar porqueria a sus canciones, malas palabras, etc
Matthew 7:5 James 2:20  Started From The Bottom.   They Just Needed To Know How Justin Would React When You Were Sent Up Ahead With What looked Like no and or not enough back up. He Loves You Alot. Like A lot A Lot.   Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 "This is La Familia/ I'll Explain Later" gOD fEARING. gOD fIRST. He had it. When he played Peter. "Peace God" She just had to see his nervousness. To understand how to best explain it later. And so Fenty Beauty "A little bit of righteousness over a lot with strife" -- tHB. God on the Mountain Top. And you feed what you focus on. Like Yeast That Activates. And Or Dough that proofs. And so when she had a little bit of Make Up with Colourful Green Eye Liner. "A Girl Like Me" Leave the first album start at the second. Start at Running This Town. And so she took the little bit of Mackup at the Mac Store. And "She took the price and she lift that witch up" -- Oneka Minaj. And then she had a lot of Mackup at Sophrah. Like So For Him -- Like with David Beckhams Beard Stuff. And good quality healthy soap for men. That doesnt destroy your body. In their own store. Grow on your own soil. Collaborate dont compromise" -- 100/100 not 50/500 gOOGLE and then tIKTOK. And she did her hmwk first and so she was good to go. And when you find out about the initial album how you though you knew everything but wait there's more. I love me an info mercurial. And then you'll think Makeup Mac to Makeup Sephora. Brilliant. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.  Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 Middle Fingers Down With a Ring on it. Fxxk Not Marrying You. A Diamond and so you may very well just be a loaf of bread.!!! "Sometimes what is good for the diamond is and or can be detrimental to the bread" - Pinterest. "Im the bakers man" -- Migos. Bakers Dozen -- Taylor Swifts 13. Sometimes the quality of the prison can just really reflect what is and or has always been going on within society. "Alienated by Society" -- Suicide Squad Song Inspo. "I chew chew chew/ cause they hope I choke" -- Doja Cat. Need To Know. You Right. "Nobody Ever Really Dies -- N.E.R.D" WITH A LEMON ON IT. 4 CANCER A LEMON TREE. CAN WASH AWAY THE STINK. CLEAN THE CHICKEN. AND LIGHTEN UP CLEAR AWAY THE DEAD RAZOR BURN SKIN. JUST USE A LITTLE BOWN SUGAR AND WATER WITH IT. AND A CUCUMBER CAN// WILL HELP YOU TO REVITATLIZE. A PICKLED CUCUMBER -- THE PICKLE BARREL. Swift CPR Certifications Please. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.  Matthew 7:5 James 2:20 Middle Fingers Down With a Ring on it. Fxxk Not Marrying You. A Diamond and so you may very well just be a loaf of bread.!!! "Sometimes what is good for the diamond is and or can be detrimental to the bread" - Pinterest. "Im the bakers man" -- Migos. Bakers Dozen -- Taylor Swifts 13. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.When you flip in the mirror and give it back so that people can get back whats theirs. Take try and balance it out by taking back what was originally theirs. "She's A Beast" -- Beyonce. It's Over Now -- The Weeknd Ft Calvin Harris. Alot With Calvin Harris. Over Now -- Deitrick Haddon. "This Is What You Came For" -- Rihanna And Taylor Swift.  "If its loving that you want come and make me your girl/ Your Girl”  "You be My Friend I Can Be Your Homie”  Fully Load And Then Break Tridents.  You're So Jazzy With it.  All Nudes Past Through Him.  Aquarius.  So You May be Naked Adn Exposed. But He’ll See It.   He’ll See Them.   And He Knows Your Face.  Blake Lively And The Guy From Kick Ass.   Chanel Perfume.   Virgo Falls Back To 5.   And So he was not just fxxk’n to fxxk.   Kissland.   “Not really into kisses leading into nothing/  I’m into shows on the road”  BG — Toronto 2017 “Take it to the 6ix where I really stay”   You married a thief and so he wants to know who you really be before he lets you in?  Youre marriage shows your heart.  And so how do you steal? When where and what?  I steal free chocolate from work when its not busy by walking by quietly.   When it is Not busy. ANd free bread and free samples of soup.   Cause Im hungry but also to see if the soup of the day and soup of the special is right and okay. Good to know for when and how you crash. And then shows about cliptomaniacs.  She’s A Maniac. And she knows. And so that when you fall back to your actual leg warmers and neon clothing time of 14. They know how to better // best help you again also this time around. While still giving you soo much space. How you can move on your own and still grow through it. Versus when you may be dying and or just need a little help. And so how to give you a good push without shoving you off the top of the edge. The Salvations Army Camp. Rock Climbing. “Save Half For Harvest” — tHB. No si-lining for today. “Not Today” — X Ambassadors Song Inspo. Renegades, “Never been afraid to say whats on my mind at any given time of day” — Jay Z ft Eminem. For when you were going to apply at Starbucks again but explain expose what you think is the actual truth. About Magic while applying. “Music is like Magic” — Eminem. All your moves. When someone pulls back to see what you really want. Versus when you keep going because you may have outgrown. Starbucks Gold Card. “Flush in with a lot of water” — My Dad. And so when you get a whole bunch of Starrbucks Drinks. And try it and customize it. That way they can also give you samples to try. Excitement around. Have Fun. Its like. Its funny. Its happy. So you get a baseline. From low risk low rewards. But also they get a parent functions on all your emotions. On reading the emotions written on your face. Rugby use your head. So that There Was Rape in the Bible. Tamar was raped. But you could see on my face that I wasnt enjoying it after I fought adn fought. A way to talk about it without re going through the trauma. The Ride. It keeps going when it wont stop. So people can know about you and balance out. And not hide secrets and nor there saying of the dark from the youths. They can just post up a farris wheel and or just an all around ride that won’t stop. Oooohhhhhhhhh Thats what Shondra Land is all about. When you can see on the faces maybe that people are not no longer enjoying it as much; maybe. But youre growing through it. Processing and working through it. Every growth gets ride of a mattress. Cause you know something is missing. And can’t yet go that deep. But youre little bit of righteousness. The Evan Ross movie was too deep but the psychological thriller was not. And so you can work hard// work smart within your limits. And so that way you can rotate your mattreses. And or get a new mattresses. All to find who is buried beneath all the mattresses. Shapeshifter. Alessia Cara. The Princess and the Pea. Children’s Book Inspo. Cancer. You were fighting to make a way for the real Cancers thats all. You were fighting to make a way for real people to be real people within society, is all. If that is what real prisons look like. Then spiritually… well the lowly there is wisdom. But youve got to walk in the shallows so that you don’t drown in it. Like parking in the driveway parking at the very end facing in. Far Sighted. 20/20 though. Spiritually Far Sided. Mentally Far Sighted. Vision and Dream Wise Far Sided. Its different for different people. And so when everyone gets to mirror in their own way you see that. And so when you make room for different kinds of people you see that. How would you mirror this? How do you mirror this?!?! And that is how you can see who needs glasses in the spirituality. ANd or how to just make room for different body sizes spiritually and soulfully. And so people dont feel like they may have to chisel themselves out to fit one body seize. But are they cutting themselves down too tight and or putting away what they’ve already go. Within their limits. Having limits to not letting anymore in. And then just digging up the grave to better help find someone who was once buried (alive) but may not yet be dead. There is still time. Rabbits bury their young sometimes but to try and keep them safe. And so really it is how do you move when you have time. Farmbooy a store with food no cleaning supplies. Dollarama self care arts adn craft meeting you where you are at. Cooking baking paint. Kitchen Stuff Plus. Kitchen Supplies. Loblaws a store that has it all. But can “Angel on Earth come under my wing”. Spirit Leaf shouldnt be underneath the cement cinder blown. It could get crushed. And so where is the store that is just for cleaning. You dont clean with the windows closed. The fumes can fxxk up your head. And so close// clog the vents let it all pile up. See what is missing. Sometimes To catch a ghost through dust on it. Areas of growth spuratically. Have them move around in the dust. Data points. 0.01 to the asymptote you can find the shapes and outlines. You need to not only have a store for cleaning but to teach to clean with the windows open. But what else is neeeded. Id dress up as a Shark. Like in a cat suit but in a light blue to light light blue shark cat suit. A skirt like the one the bald green headed alien wore in Need To Know. On the outskirt of the cat suit. You dont need to see all the shapes. But it is a one piece cat suit fitted shark suit. With like a Kate Spade Shapes // Styled Shaped Backpack. Like for the shark fin it’d be like a pyramid style backpack. Kind of like those Michael Kors Backpacks and or Matt and Natt back packs but it comes out 3D like a Triangle. And then the top of the shark part would be like a shark onesie. The top of like a hoddie. Thats is sexy shark. The other is like a shark onesie. ;). And Thats Me! Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.

Matthew 7:5 James 2:20  Newer Safer And Healthy Limits.   Baby Shark! — Conversations With Kendra C.   Anyways can I use your photo as my cover photo? Between giving credit, waiting on people to respond. Paying attention if they say no. Respecting limits. Knowing adn listening to vibes of if and how they say no. And so trying to have adn keep an emotional boundary, system and emotional striations. As well with living out loud so that there are systems adn signs. And flags.  But also finding the fast lane but after I find a healthy and safe space to fumble slowly. Ugh wanting to collaborate but not be possibly brought down by the wrong teammate. Not leave myself out and or possibly behind emotionally. As well as trying to count myself in as a person. Adn not limiting myself to one version. Knowing the box so that I can decide if and when I would like to stay within it. Having my own box so that I can know that I am not crossing other peoples lines if I should chose to step out of my box. Know my healthy and safe limits from pushing myself to go far, but also know when and how to safely stop. SO that I am not the one neither who could very well be crossing my own emotional wall, line, limit and or boundary. Its a lot. Its a Quarterly Report. Emotional Tax Season. You Know.  Day And Night both have peak rush hour seasons though.  Driving at night so that you know how to better drive in the day time.  Im trying to grow through this pandemic.

So that when I feel like going my own speed. I dont have to worry about potentially dragging anybody, people not keeping up. And or have to stop -- being// getting in my zone -- to pay attention to other peoples speeds. Mentally you know.  I appreciate you speaking up for yourself though.  I got so caught up telling you to use it as your cover photo. ADN mind mapping processing other ideas. That I just saw the beauty of it.  Can I use the photo as my Cover photo.

Recuerdo que la primera cancion de Imagine Dragons que escuche es la de radioactive y fue la  aguja que encontre en la paja (osea que la busque incansablemente) y me encanto sus canciones, osea men, es increible que apesar de que muchos lo critican mantienen su postura de no agregar porqueria a sus canciones, malas palabras, etc ademas es uno de los muy pocos grupos que se han burlado de si mismo en una de sus canciones, sino que el unico

This song was lit 🔥
As all I know this song is at Target in the big TV.
And here I thought it couldn't get any stupider than Thunder. whoop whoop.
"Let's write a song about sharks, but not actual sharks. It's about keeping bad company with liars. AND let's make the video in a casino, like card sharks, but it's about actual sharks"
the end?
Vegas baby ✨💟

The song is amazing and the video gives me big Ocean's 11 vibes! ^^ Love it <3

I will forever remember the guy that recommended imagine dragons to my playlist that is true love❣
Bro Tom Cruise? never heard of him. They need to be in a movie cause they are fantastic
On repeat on Spotify
Imagine dragons would make a great gospel song
Was just at the KC concert and it was amazing!
I love song
This is art 💙
Does somebody know why this song sounds like "las de la intuición"?
was about to say disappointed by the lack of actual sharks but at least one person in the making of this was on the same page as me.
That got some awesome beats and smooth lyrics
Where's Ben McKee (the bassist) in this video? I don't see him 🤔
Best Song Ever
Me and my kiddos were just at his concert in kc yesterday and this was the first time I had heard this song. I immediately had to look it up 🥰
Visual and music masterpiece

This song is about my life 😬😲
This song is so bad..
Дэн, что с тобой? Почему так плохо выглядишь? Солнце, возвращайся на небо!  Надеюсь, что Ты все преодолеешь! Силы ведь немерено!!! Свети!!!!!

Good. AAAA
Casino
And You Think"This Is Bad" ,Just Be ME For One Day...
Wow this song is amazing favorite song good for montage and AMV's
São perfeitos!
´Sharks´ - Great music. Force me to press replay. Even loop.
I started listening to them 7 years ago never been disappointed
Why this sounds same as bones ?
We got to hear it live in SLC. Great concert.
Dobra vam je pesma.
trop cool pierpol
I want gura to cover this.
I am literally blown away by the ability this band possesses to simply ALWAYS deliver such impeccable music! Some people are saying that they aren't as 'hardcore' as they used to be.   I can only feel sorry for those people for not being able to listen to their music without having to comment on every track as if they could have done any better themselves ...lol, not keeping in mind, that this group (for example) has produced 6 full albums already with 3 singles having stayed on the Billboard top 100 for more than 52 weeks (making them the first band EVER to achieve this milestone!)  ...SO YEAH, LONG LIVE IMAGINE DRAGONS!  (Wish I could afford a ticket to go see them when they come to South Africa next year!!!)
واو 😄💖حبيت
This is one remarkeble song about poker, Sharks playing on tables, think they are better then others, in the end ofc they are the same as the others. in and out makes sense just play little unpredictable, but know you play that you play vs others. first in and then out and they know. in the end you get to a table full of sharks. Also the clowns are a sign to this.
the sharks are not really agresives just when have hungry but no all the time try to eat humans if dont have option he gonna eat them but hes can eat fishes so the sharks are not really bad for the world the cocos kill more than sharks for year psdt: i am sorry for my try to say this in englysh i know y can use traductor but i don want to, thanks for you time
Seriously
This should become a soundtrack for Mission Impossible or James Bond. :D
I literally thought that was Tiffany Pollard lmao
Los necesito ver en Argentina
L
Aguardando vcs no Brasil em outubro….👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Another hit, guys!! Love from Denmark 🤩🥰❤️
He tried too make a bad song the result is better then he tinks he is a legend
u can only describe this in one word ONLY one word                                                                     AMAZING

🔥
The best song forever
Yo no sé si estos muchachos se habrán dado cuenta del tema que hicieron...se robaron el año!!!

Ok this song is a massive banger
New fav song for real
IMAGINE DRAGONS - DAN REYNOLDS - guarantee of success: music, voice, rythm, sound effects, video, smile, dance :-)))))
Man as he gets older I really do look like him, the singer. Just a bit uglier. 😅 Glad to see him do an awesome music video here in Vegas. Sometimes I hate this city but after some extensive travels I realize it's not that bad.
remember met of Ocean 12. At the End of the movie, the french guy do the same thing with laser.  Wonder if the inspiration came from these 3 movies. omg love
❤️
SHARGAWY
Thank You , Dan 😘😘😘😘💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻God whit You 🙏🏼😇
Well done Dan renolds
TEMASOOOOOO,me encanta.lo escucho una y otra vez,es adictivo.exelente

Eminem ? Without me?

im speachless
❤👌
Sooo.. Anyone gonna ask about what he just did? Man really snuck through a high security casino just to open up the water fountains and surf with sharks
Hope Imagine Dragons never breaks up, the genius behind their projects  is more than impeccable!!
Imagine dragos es mi banda favorita
Dirk Dark?
ja ouvi umas 1000 vezes kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk mto bom msm
Imagine Dragons nunca me ha decepcionado con sus canciones, son muy buenas, además, viendo sus videos musicales, te sientes viendo una película, son muy buenos
Such a masterpiece but they still have the humor to put 'Dick Dark' on his nametag
It's rare to see a major star have a solid head on their shoulders.  Great song, great mv.
this isn't a music video, this is a full heist movie in 3 minutes
fan of imagine dragons since 2013
The band breaking up may have been a good thing...
love it
Pinaka mayaman yarrn?
Why is there so many Espanol comments on this english song?
This gives me Ocean’s 11/Now You See Me Vibes
i want this to be the song of Arcane S2 😂
I LOVE THIS SONG 🥹❤️ And I love sharks 💀😂🦈
My demons
Giving me Ricky Martin vibe in the best way possible
Sacar malas canciones Imagine Dragons: no amigo aquí no hacemos eso
Another Masterpiece!
A heist movie where nothing is stolen, but sharks are released into unsalted water, which would probably be bad for them.
2:15 - 2:29  Dan attempting to ...dance? 😅
alguien se pregunta que tiene que ver un tiburon con esto xd     no es hate
Do you think swimming with sharks is scary?      Imagine dragons
sharks don't know a killer whale is rolling up
Eh I don't like it
at some point reminds Muse (in a good sence of course) Great work, stealing to favs!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🔝
Every fucking song is a hit!
discret ad for samsung
A melhor bandaaaa!
Good, good
Sono italiano ma questa canzone spacca proprio💪🤩🤩🇮🇹

LO MEJOR DE LO MEJOR, ALGUIEN SE HA DADO CUENTA DE QUE LOS VIDEOS SON DE PELICULAS: ESTE RECUERDA A OCEAN 11.
esta cancion merece estar en el soundtrack de una peli de ladrones o de apuestas XD
How much money did go in making of vid
wupup :)
Impossible superar Imagine dragone♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
too funny, apt n cute!! bon Danke ✌❤😁
ME ENCANTAAA
Sorry but Enemy is better ( no hate )
0:33 yes 💯 No one is better than Eminem 👍💯
One of my faves from the album! But was anyone else hoping for a little more flair in the laser dodging scene? Would have loved to have seen him go full Britney like in the Toxic music video.
The perfect music
Świetna piosenka, ciężko przestać słuchać.
Lerit go lerit g
Sharks 🦈
Esto me recuerda a cuando jugaba hungry shark pero no sé porque This remember me when I play hungry shark but I don't no why 🤣
I love it!!👏👏👏
Cobra starship vibes
Ooo
6 años escuchando su música y sigue sin decepcionarme :)
amazing
El video de esta canción bien podría ser una película
Why did you guys used the very similar bass like this one from Shakira? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKlpL4FhzUs This is dope btw!
Dan, everyone.... please don't ever change. Your music has been the fun score to my 20s, and in the last few years, since Origins, has been the score to my struggle with bipolar depression. Fuck the haters, fuck the noise, you lift me up and feel heard and understood and I can't wait to see you in concert a few weeks from now. Another banging single, just keep being you.
0:25 solo yo escucho huevos???
Oceans
Muito bom

Imagine dragons really tells who you are, the sweet candy, the curious kind, the stone hearted or the devil's pet
This song should be my new ringtone. Wonderful. Great job 👍👌
Very good music like always
Good samsung advertisement, and song also :)
Very slick and sexy.  Love Imagine Dragons. 💗

Calidad y muy originales
No one gonna talk about how they gave the guard almost an entire bottle of what I'm going to assume is melatonin? Edit: Amazing song btw
One of my favorite ImagineDragons song
❤
I have already listened to this on pandora over and over again its immaculate!
the best part is the beginning
this is so catchy
100% true
He’s slick
I think you should do a duet with Billie Elish you two would sound good together 🖤
More than just a song. His voice God
0:13 Ah yes my favorite part, gives me goosebumps
Esta canción me encanto 💖 imagine dragons no deja de alegrarme es muy buena
this song hits so hard.. so relatable
common w for imagineDragons
very good song like normal
cool
Super track !!! I recommend !!! Greetings from Ukraine!!! https://youtu.be/FkeKfmhZ0cc
Read the lyrics what a terrible messages!
2:29 was quite the banger and i was't ready kEKW
the song bones is still insane
🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️
its so nice
What a song keep it up bro
最高
All this needed was The Fonze jumping over a shark.      Well, maybe not.
I mean the ''start''
dam after (Bone) we have another AWEsome quality MV. He dam Talent! keep strong stay healthy brother!
the star of sharks is the same as the final of bones
Imagine dragons are creative diferent from most of the others. the others just create love music and imagine dragons create every type of music
Братан ты выбрал не ту сторону СЛАВА РОССИИ🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
that's my favourite music
the start of this music is the same as the end of bones.
i think this is another reference from the Movie
I just can't let go his voice
amazing song, but the bass sounds like one of Muse's song time is running out lol
Temón! Me gusta la referencia a Ocean's Twelve, concretamente la escena del robo bailando capoeira https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr834Cs9ncs
al principio parece el comienzo de "antologia" de shakira jajajaja
SoOoOo CoOoOoOoL 😍 👌
My new addiction.❤️❤️❤️❤️
dan is soooo cute i love his voice
Imagine dragon isn't imagine   means they all triumph
legit this gave me oldschool KPOP beat vibes.
❤️
It has to be very obvious this was filmed in Las Vegas
Incredible!!!!!
Ñ
Yo in going to your guys concert this Friday and I would enjoy it if you would respond to my comment 😁
joder que buena canción se me erizan los pelos del ano
What song does the bass line sample?  I've heard it before but can't remember the song.
sado derugi canus coller
What smartphone is using Dan Reynolds in the second 0:31?
Yo y los caporales
haha, imagine dragons lmao

Oceans 11 kinda vibes. Nice😎
thats fantastic its my favourite song ❤
esta canción es increíble como imagine dragons,todas sus canciones te hacen bailar aunque no quieres o no te guste bailar amo sus canciones y a ellos
I lived 30 years waisting my ears with shit,and never knew Imagine Dragons make such good song...litteram every song is a masterpiece! My favourite is Bones and the vide is amazing.
Amazing❤️
I really love this Song, it has a very nice Sound and i just have to sing along, when i hear it❤️ But I think, it wasn‘t necessary to work with Sharks in Aquariums, that‘s just not where these majestic animals belong😉 But The Video is breathtaking  Lots of love xx
Can’t help but bust a move to this song every time I hear it😎✌🏼
Warning! No samsung phone is harmed here!
👍👍👍👍👍
Amooo ❤
Bones then this, MASTERPIECE AFTER MASTERPIECE!
I can hear that song for a movie like this, with thieves, ocean eleven style :D
Yes
Beo Imagine dragons never dissapoints me with single music!! I LOVE THIS
One  more Masterpiece  is created 😄😄
Sharks is a song about psychopaths and sociopaths... people with no empathy that feed on the rest of Humanity... like sharks. "Take advantage off your niceness Cut you up in even slices Prey on your fear"  Good luck humanity!
Proud of you 😊😀😀
👍  ♥️ 👍
Increible
Let's see how much love this song.  2/8/2022
BIG LOVE FROM MALAYSIA ❤️🌷
There are to many sharks dan I'm nearly drowning God bless
Czy jest tu ktoś z Polski kto uwielbia słuchać imaginedragons?
Sharks👌👌
A Imagine Dragons nadie les supera ❤️❤️❤️
This is my favorite band!
guys, how much are you going to weddings?
ชอบมากครับ.. รักเลย ❤🤩
Whopp whoop
I want a Gura Cover now..... GURAAAAAA
No toda la música actual es mala, para muestra Imagine Dragons ❤❤
😍
Wish I could go to the raiders stadium in real life
Am I the only who felt like the beat of this song sounds like bones
yeeessss.🦈
That's because the ghost writer for them and most.....is the anointed cherubim.....the leader of the choir.....that then fell and is better known as that old serpent......or DRAGON......... Imagine Dragons......
This song is beautiful, the beat, the harmony in the voices, the visuals, just everything. This is the vibe for the rest of the summer.
best videoclip ever by dragons?
Started off with thunder a kinda cringy song and now to sharks the most bad-ass song ever
Me encanta
This is one of those songs which you can never get tired of
A little homage to Casino (M. Scorsese)
bro litterly swimming with sharks
bah...io ci sento i Korn, ad un  certo punto...
Hello guy. What is the brand of the motorcycle?
how many times did you hear the song me: yes
The last scene is clearly sponsored by surfshark
Intro it’s like BONES
Ocean’s theme
Picks up the phone, nods and hangs the phone... ?:D
Cant stop watching
Love it
Me encanta como le hacen propaganda a el galaxy fold 3 xD
the aesthetic of this song is just transcended
And yet - who is Dick Dark?
PETA is getting really bold, huh?
Dan y love you 🛐🛐🛐🛐
The best song ever
jak zawsze  super
Pay day 2 Heist
КРУТО !!!
How many Deeply Meaningful Songs will you make??? "Yes"
Filmed in my hometown!!!

Nice video
vlog Casha thanks for sharing your stories with WORK AND TRAVEL manipulators
This song is too rhythm Ig and catchy i started to listen since last week
I think in recent times, as a band Imagine Dragons are continuously getting better than most of the other bands.
Is no one gonna talk abt him using the Z fold 3??? I have like never seen that used in media like it’s a regular thing to have one
Sharks seems like an awesome song for Shark Week!
🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈
Fascinante!!!! No dejo de repetirla y el vocalista luce increíble, sexy, guapo, masculino, y un maestro de la trampa!!!!
0:47 best part
Let go Shark 🦈🦈🦈❤️❤️❤️
Why
I am better than them I don't want to be them it's wrong
The Mind control programs, are more focused on Nerve Hacking Body control, which shuts off Consciousness, and becomes Receiver of incoming signals, and reactions. The advanced remote control, generates an artificial action, which is planting false situations, they intend on defrauding courts with. The false records generated by human trafficking, prevents conventional law enforcement techniques, from stopping crime, but diverts offense to the Military Equipment: Sold to Cops, others. The Black Market is protected, with criminal contracts, distributions of convenient activities, for Ear Marks, and other Money Laundering Schemes.  The False records, are replacements, to the legal Rights and actions, of the Target, which generates liabilities, and distractions to cover against Liabilities. The worst creeps, are provided these illegal surveillance techniques, for an espionage Civil War, of Confederate Wizards v. the American Rule of Law, and its means of enforcement. The protection of the secrets, is the use of the Biblical Witchcraft, Sorcerers, and other frauds, using Obstruction of Justice, for convenient injuries to the greater society. The Secret Courts, and Secret Police, and counteracted "Secret Science", is the classic Magic of the Satanists, and frauds Hated by God! Estimated Investments to Save Block Buster, Mixed with Netflix as account for none competition agreement, while connected. #WaronDavid projected connection to Black Rock, generating repulsion from original investments, when they join: Don't Put Wine in wrong Wine Skins. Selling all positions, on all Black Rock shared companies, as complete separation, was projected for Economic Security: Fundamental to main Contracts with Government. Don Sr. Boles was projected to Win Q.E. contracts, from Federal Account, and the promises where assumed Redacted obligations, such as Economic Security:  Insurance Bonds, covers Fiduciary Investments for Feds Account. The Estimates for David's Character, include insurance against Stock Advice, from sources that he wouldn't trust. The Puts, against advice of success, for many of these trades automated for Fiduciaries, on behalf of General Traders, with Bond Support, for higher accounts. The extra would sell buy backs to the holder, who would receive the shares, if triggered: Economic Slow collapse Security Algorithm. They believed they contracted Economic Hit men against this concept, which is designed to destroy the American Stability, to overthrow the Government, with Voter Fraud, and other crimes: In David's Absence.  SCOTUS pretends its over its Oath of Office to the Constitution, in order the claim the compromised Military is above them, in unequal Branches. The Law, then Courts, then Confederate Militia, is basically the criminal Coup, in the #WaronDavid, and these insane lawless Nazi's, are purely a Wizard System for crime Permits: Intimidates Victims. The Coercion, of the infinity extorted Socialist Society, is similar to the desire of DND Demon Lord of Slime: All become Equally worthless, in Suicide Bombing. When all are equally weak, then the Society, will be conquered, by some weak outsider, who is simply better then the lowest valued Sludge: Used to be People.

Me encanta que el vídeo sea del tipo espionaje

I like it

So lеt it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you'rе in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  this tempo reminds me of the structure of Crazy Town  Now Ladies come, ladies go, Out my revolving door Some ladies never come back, Most come back for more. I've got a house in the hills With a door that spins. Goes in and out, Out and in, 'Round and 'round again.

Mi stupiscono sempre ...ovviamente positivamente mooolto positivamente.fantastici

The  “Get you get you” was really my favourite
This could be nice for a tv show or movie . Especially the boys
TELL ME AT LEAST ONE BAD SONG FROM THEM. I FUCKING ENJOY UR MUSIC! <333
The best shot in whole video clip is from 2:45.
Finding a bad Imagine dragons song is impossible. I like almost every song of them that i have heard.
Incredibili! Come sempre UNICI! Anche quando fanno canzoni più leggere sanno come non essere mai banali. Siete geniali, ragazzi 😍😍
Imaginedragon deeznuts
The spirit of unreasonable braveness is close to Russians, not speaking about politics, but in whole)
imagine dragons never disappoints
Sempre attuali 👍
Such a cool, catchy song.
this is sick!
underrated
P Oioi99iii88
The laser scene is too good
Pues acá intercalando con Guerrillas!!!
I can't help noticing the name tag though🤣 Overall I just love their songs. Full of lessons
Gonna say i was here and look back 10 years later...

Pra mim é a melhor banda q existe , lanças várias músicas boas para escutar no dia a dia
So hang on..the whole heist's point was to let sharks into the fountain? Or were they already there and the tunnel was just a viewing area? So then the point is to surf with sharks...
unavailable in russia😐 well...thanks from all russian fans
Um máximoooo a batida o som tudooo
My birthday, thanks. 🤙
Imagine dragons the best 👌
The bass sounds the same as a shakira's song...
Россия любит вас, не смотря ни на что.
English: When are you going to give a concert in Puerto Rico?  Español: ¿Cuándo darán un concierto en Puerto Rico?

I attempted a cover of Whatever It Takes - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBaZC7RbFNA Please check it out and help me improve :)
i couldn't imagine how hard it could be to pull a switch
This reminds me a lot of Ocean’s Eleven, as it has a similar theme and as always, perfect song for the perfect video. Imagine Dragons being able to pull a heist!
And another amazing song by imagine dragons
Onlar en iyisi herdilden dinleyicisi var

They outperform most groups when it comes to creating great new songs that become catchy or popular hits.  But more importantly, they perform in concert even better than in their videos.  The energy, instruments, voice, and all-around performance make it something you can't wait to see again.
The way Dan pass the laser beams
Why bops like rhis don't get the respect and fame it really really deserves ? I didn't have a clue for month and on .
Lyrics: Trouble  Blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters Eat you alive Levels Better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil Butter to knife  You think you're better than them Better than them You think they're really your friends Really your friends But when it comes to the end To the end You're just the same as them Same as them  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  He's comin' to get you (woo-woo) He's comin' to get you, get you (woo)  Bubbles Drownin', you see in doubles Don't you let 'em see your struggles Hiding your tears Crisis Take advantage off your niceness Cut you up in even slices Prey on your fear  You think you're better than them Better than them (you think you're better) You think they're really your friends Really your friends (really) But when it comes to the end To the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them Same as them  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows (ooh) You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me  Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything (Sharks) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks) Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks  Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me

Best band ever

When you think ImagineDragons run out of ideas but instead they just make another insane song
After seeing this i think Dan Reynolds could be in a spy movie.
This is true tallent
You know Imagine Dragons be speaking some truths behind their songs. Just saying, "there be monsters down here."
Dan Reynolds for James Bond
#عنب_بناتي show one 😊
Se va a lalista 🎧✨⚡ QUE GRAN TEMAZO!
Aun no ha muerto la banda de Linkin Park pero estos tipos estan pegados

Found this accidentally. Been listening to it none-stop since.

상상용❤😍
I like shark more++++++,hey shark you more friend to me,let's do something best with me
Imagine dragons siempre va a sacar buenas canciones no, no buenas excelentes
NO WAY THERE'S 4K QUALITY??????!!!!!!!
Such a good rythm, what i love of imagine dragons that not many bands do is make the lyrics as a story almost a bit like other bands like stromae, billie eilish ect.
👍👍😁😁👍👍
very good song as always getting good hits
So it's about..... freeing those sharks?
Another fantastic song
Excellent as always! Best band!
I gotta be honest here  This is one of the worst songs I listened to in 2022
Being hooked on this song in a convenient store at the first time.
Imagine Dragons, this song is sooo good, Respect I feel it
The sharks aren't at the Bellagio though. They are at Mandalay Bay, which is at the far end of The Strip.   DING.
One of my favorite songs
Sharks by Imagine Dragons--- This song created by Dian Rubianti /completely composed by Dian Rubianti alone. Released by Imagine Dragons by original genre, full song melody and rhytm/beat created alone by Dian Rubianti (perfectly released by Imagine Dragons the way it was created by singing by Dian Rubianti completely) (The lyrics written completely as creativity Imagine Dragons team song writer) letter on comment from the owner of this song, Dian Rubianti. 18-Nov-81
*Entendi algo? Talvez, mas sinceramente, amei kkkkk*
Imagine dragons finally watched Ocean’s 11
the laser beam scene is a reference to the pacifier?
Honestly it's boring
Excellent. Merci
Okay, real question is... Are they able to make bad song?
How are they on tour and still making new videos?
💖💖💖💖💖💖
I watched this on Spotify last month
the likelihood that fairies exist is higher than the likelihood of imagin dragons making a bad song  è piu alta la probabilità che le fate esistono rispetto a quella che gli imagin dragons facciano una brutta canzone
Poor sharks
https://youtu.be/Rc6OFmEDdws
that's a great and bad song. i think i'll make a minecraft lyrics video for it
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Meow
2:27 that's a hard part, I would love see him perform it live
This Song is very Bad and cool.
music is not politics
Впн в помощь

Cutthroat and this I think one of my personal favorite cus they have a violent sounds and hits and beats and acting
Let go❤
Anime version,suites so well
This might be the worst song I’ve ever heard. And before you say “well then why did you listen to it in the first place?” They’re advertising the hell out of it everywhere.
PERSONALY I THINK ENEMY IS BETTER BUT ITS STILL❤‍🔥
Masterpiece👏❤
Still the shhh
I will freak out if they don’t sing this song at their concert in September!!!  Please add this to the song list. Please please please😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
O crime perfeito não exis- (The perfect crime doesn't exis-)
hey guys can you make a bad song just once? (Ei caras, será que dá pra fazer uma música ruim só uma vez?)
This song and Bones is actually about the world market right now.
Why steal the bass line from new years day?
They are the best
And this is my favorite band and the 3 popular band in the world
I went to Vegas when this was Uploaded and I went to the Giant Screen and I heard The Killer's and this band
Lagu yang sangat menyenangkan dan enerjik 🤍
in dan's identity business, is there something weird written or am i going crazy?
Bruh, it astonishes me how many minutes, hours, and days it takes to make a masterpiece such as this, and produces a 3 minutes long vid and leaving you craving for more of their songs.  So much work goes into this, and I hope people who have not heard ID(somehow) can appreciate this band ✊🏿🗿
My new fav song
My new fav song
You are my favorite singer
does anyone know the story of the music video? i'm curious really
Sorry but this sounds like he came up with the song in 5 minutes. It's so simple and hollow
ALHAMDULILLAH(SWT), ASTAGHFIRULLAH(SWT)
Very Nice Bro! Get Good Gamers!
🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝 From Brazil Oh yeah, very nice !! Temazo muy bueno !! Très bonne chanson !! Música muito legal !!
let it go let it go like Elsa
As a classical music lover, had no idea who Imagine Dragons were until my 10 yo son fell in love with their songs, And they were a huge revelation. for me. So that is how I, as a 45 yo fart became enchanted with their music. And they have everything. The vocals, the lyrics, the easiliy memorizable melody, the powerful sound, Their huge success is perfectly expected, Wish they had a concert in Croatia or that part of Europe
Awful as always, voice sounds like the first successful attempt at a robot making a pop song
fantano sent me here
this song is not that good COMPERED to THEIR OTHER song, BUT IT'S STILL GOOD!!!
Never heard of these guys until today.
blander than a piece of untoasted white bread with margarine spread
Make a video of dull knives and Giants, please 🥺😍😍
I wish there was a haha button in youtube
I think a lot of us are waiting for the Imagine Dragons and One Republic collab.

Oh guys! I was a fan from the very beginning in your group until you got into politics. I unsubscribe from you with great regret. But ambassadors in a fascist country like Ukraine, sorry. A country that has been killing children for 8 years! I hope you succeed in politics. I am against fascism 😞
Typical American crap.
not suprised at all, everything they make is gold

This will go higher 🌡️
Sharks is a song about liars, and this video perfectly captures it.  The overall theme of this video is heist-styled, but they're not actually stealing anything - they're letting sharks loose. Stealthy heists are compiled of lies so no one knows that anything is being stolen or messed with. But why set loose sharks? Because sharks, in terms of lyrics, are liars. Liars who would try to stop anything that gets in their way, like how sharks set prey on the first person they see, especially if the person panics. By letting sharks loose, Dan Reynolds has released lies to the world - and with that many sharks, the lies are unstoppable.  The video begins with Reynolds planning with his team - what facts would cause the lie to fail, and what would support it. Then comes the distractions - whether it's drugging the camera guy, engaging some guards in a conversation, or causing a ruckus to clear a pathway, these actions distract those who have the highest chance of exposing the lie.  A notable moment is the bridge, where Reynolds sneaks through a bunch of lasers. It's a high-tension moment, as one wrong move can already ruin the whole scheme. Reynolds is forced to make absurd moves - or, conceptually, stretch the truth in wild ways - to finally set loose the sharks.  In the end, this video is not just a heist story - it's a metaphorical showcase of how one lie can set loose more. And it's amazingly made, I can tell you that.
Zomer het is nu volop zomer ik lig hier te dag dromen in de hete zon.

The amount of hits this band has given is absolutely mind blowing,this song is a pure work of art, all the way from the lyrics to the tune it's HEAVENLY!!, the best things about Imagine Dragons is that all their songs are so well writen, this is literally poetry, the music video directed by Drew Kirsch is so well matched with the vibe of this song, definitely one of best looks of all the band members they look so damm cool kinda Bond-esque,I'll say it again THERE NEVER WAS, IS, OR EVER WILL BE A BAND LIKE IMAGINE DRAGOns!!!!
E as lendas lançaram álbum novo 🍷🗿
I love so much

My Love Daniel  ❤❤
Não há uma única música de Imagine Dragons que eu não goste, são todas únicas, com letras fabulosas. Posso dizer que presentemente são o meu grupo favorito. Parabéns e continuem a dar-nos boa música.

Cirque du soleil?
la audacia de ellos radica en que se atreven a intentar componer canciones con ritmos y melodías si bien algo similares a sus antiguas canciones,  estas nuevas buscan modernizar el oídio humano , creando canciones que sean escuchadas en esta época , como que quieren inventar su genero musical
Flamingos  Like & Sub plz😁
a certain shark girl gonna be really happy when she sees this song
👍👍👍👍
Топ. Просто топ.
BETTER THAN THEM! BETTER THAN THEM!
A song with bitter truth
This song is so catchy!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Very cute Ocean's spoof! I LOVE IT! Keep em coming Dan!
Why's it even called Imagine Dragons. Should just be credited Dan Reynolds at this point as the label doesn't even display the band anymore. Just like maroon 5.
Perfeito
Wow this song so catchy

Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."

É uma pena a indústria não ter valorizado essa dupla
POT FARMER DANCE SONG % I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot You better believe it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes They did nothing but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis could not walk around I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack After I smoked some to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around  Got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where wild birds nest  Found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail  Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in a camouflage suit  Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn’t be found. Came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone  I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!  By Kansas City Poet Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share! Google = George Bush Tom Zart Google = Pot Farmer Poem
j'adore je suis completement fan de ce titre et encore plus de ce merveilleux groupe !!!!!!

how many hit songs do you wanna create? imagine dragons: yes.
Trouble Blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters Eat you alive Levels Better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil Butter to knife You think you're better than them Better than them You think they're really your friends Really your friends But when it comes to the end To the end You're just the same as them Same as them So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks He's comin' to get you (woo-woo) He's comin' to get you, get you (woo) Bubbles Drownin', you see in doubles Don't you let 'em see your struggles Hiding your tears Crisis Take advantage off your niceness Cut you up in even slices Prey on your fear You think you're better than them Better than them (you think you're better) You think they're really your friends Really your friends (really) But when it comes to the end To the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them Same as them So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows (ooh) You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything (Sharks) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks) Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me
Great Song!
Highly doubt it was the inspiration but I'm just going to say the laser scene was a get smart reference
For some reason, every time I hear this song, I keep imagining this song being sung by Michael Jackson, in the same vein as “Smooth Criminal.”
Wow, its the best song dor now. Its amazing
Fifa 23 song??
Les gens en train de danser seul dans leur salon manifestez-vous qu’on vienne vous rejoindre 😂 sérieux cette musique donne trop envie de danser
Brutal, esquisita music
Bussin 😩
Que temazo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I didn't realize this song came out LAST MONTH! I was shocked how NO ONE knows about it!!!  It's so catchy! Once again, imagine dragons proves themselves to be the BEST pop band ever WITHOUT a doubt!
cuando se supera esta canción?

Música foda

Дякую за відео! Дякую за підтримку України в боротьбі з росіським агресором
Very gooood. Thanks very much, for video!
This is my favourite music
The best Band ever
Jajajajajaja
They have always made great songs... unique style ... this one, is epic. It is a master piece in simple lyrics and catchy tunes, and that voice... loving it
Sharks 🦈 🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈
palabras
Imagine dragon's successes manifested once they replaced their Jesus mindset with the opposite. Promoting: "woke lifestyle" LBGT, abortion, anti-police, anti gun, pro drugs and sex. They rose to the top. I wonder if rejecting: Religion, Godly morals, purity, sobriety,  etc...affected them mentally as they once were Mormon church boys?
Ses trop bien cette music!!!
this band makes amazing music every song they release is fucking awesome
Amo demais ImagineDragons. Minha banda favorita 😍😍 se um dia vier pra minha cidade e eu não ir, eu morro. Impossível se enjoar das músicas
Er zijn niet veel songs die ik gelijk al nice vind, maar deze is echt vuur!!

His name tag says Dick Dark
Imagine Dragons is famous. He would most likely get a very successful job there. He could have just worked there instead of stealing.
Haters be like: fuck impossible make a bad song of imagine dragons, so awesome!

All of ImagineDragons' songs are unique and each song makes me feel something different from the others. All of their songs has a different vibe and I think it's great and I also think this feature makes this band special from all other bands.
ImagineDragons não tem um música ruim? So lança as braba.
Does it seem similar to Ocean’s 13 to anyone else?

Here imagining dragons while witnessing human legends 💕
If doging lasers was that easy
I have o neg blood  type
Just 8 million?
New fave song now but
Guess they're fans of Ocean's Twelve.....
I think they made a deal with the devil(or crossroad demon)😆. Because how can they have so much hit songs? And not make a single bad song?   We will find out in 10 years when they come and collect the souls.😂
Samsung was like "Nah I want a feature, BTS ain't here"
MY BANDS FAVORITE, ARE THE BETTER
Every song they make is like telling a short story.. it's just so amazing how their song blow up social media
Como é possível, eles nunca erram
Honestly I'm getting bullied for liking imagine dragons but idc now I use imagine dragons to flex by singing enemy lol I love how relaxing this is I also like that imagine dragons doesn't sing about inappropriate stuff too
wtf is this shit? Is world gone made? Listening monkey music? Devolution is reall! Its happening right now!!!
Is it me or is this music video a reference of Oceans 11 (it's a movie for those who don't know)
😍
I like how the beats connect with bones
also a good promo for samsung lol
Right place to come listening song...Awesome...Imagine now it's called imagine dragon boom boom...
❤❤❤❤❤
Good song as always ❤️
Quem mais do Brasil viajou no clipe 😍🇧🇷
Guess who's the sponsor for the video...
Amazing
A qualidade do Mv ta impecável
Tudo perfeito 👏👏
Um... We did not commend his body to the deep end my dear friend. Raise the pirate flag. I am not swimming to shore, why would I. I am an able sailor. Abe... shit! Abe was my friend too.
The perfection in every song 🥰❤️
Imagine dragons always have the best catchy melodies 🎵
Só pedrada SLC
I am not an astrologer but i can tell it with full confidence. Imagine dragons will never disappoint us. They have magic
This Song Is realluly gorgeous. Likes the other Songs of this Amazing band

I told imagine Dragons about my problems and two weeks later they released sharks 💕
This song literally made for GURA.
Amazing song .
❤️❤️❤️
I love the combination of strutting confidence and awkward nervousness - he blended them well.
this is now my favorite song and I am the biggest imagine dragons fan ever!!! they will never make a bad song in history.
Ótima direção
There isn't a bad song just a song for people with different tastes.
hi imagine dragons is the best and sub to Dino nuggets forever
omg did anyone  realize that this song starts with the tune that bones ends with
Actually this song remind me some melody.. any idea what song I can have in my mind?
why they used the same bassline from bones though?
Always my favorite singers
It's my favourite team ! I like Sharks,Bones all song !
Those learn English through Imagine Dragons👈🏻
I was fucking crying when I couldn't go to Opener in poland to see you guys
We watched a casino heist in three minutes instead of two and a half hour. Thank you imagine dragon for saving us spending hours for that movie 🥰
Me encanta Imagine Dragons y como la rompieron con Believer, Enemy, Bones y sharks
their album mercury act 1 & 2 is huge, so they have music for every taste. this has to be one of my favorites tho. whole new style. and the voice to instrument mix is just unbelievably good!!
ممتاز  thanķ you
Amoooooo❤❤❤
The best music I ever in my entire life
Michael Jackson vibes!
I think there hinting to a song for army of the dead because bones has zombies and sharks hints to a robbery from army of the died how someone betrayed them
Imagine Sharks🦈
But have you ever IMAGINE dragons?
Anyone else get this on a ad?
here early ish
Sou do Brasil e gostei muito da banda Imagine Dragons!
GUYS I LOVE YOUR SONGDS!!! each one of them is unique and always feels amazing, thanks for that❤
The only band I like better than imagine dragons is Twenty Øne Piløts

🇺🇲🇮🇹🇮🇱🇪🇦 to all actors of Hollywood that they did great acción movien o gánster móvies
Cosa dire. Le vostre canzoni sono famosissime in tutto il mondo. Italia, Spagna... dappertutto. Siete Grandi.
Omg.. It's so Good!!
Imagine Dragons est un groupe dont la particularité est de toujours nous surprendre, et c'est pour cela que nous l'aimons. La sortie de chaque nouvel album est un événement, "Mercury act 2" en tête, tout comme celle des clips. "Sharks", tourné chez eux à Las Vegas, en est un parfait exemple.
Have to admit impressive video Drew 😎
The lyrics fits perfectly in my current situation in my new job.
The song is very good
,,,Pure brilliance as always,,,
I love your songs
the best song , greetings 😍❤
Gorillaz vibes
The video work👏 Oh my, Im Speechless.😍
While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.   (2 Corinthians 4:18) - Repent. The LORD Jesus is coming soon.
Swimming with sharks  Flying with dragons

New Hit???????
Hi
F-5 TO A SHARK BY IMAGINE DRAGONS
Am i the only one that saw that his name tag is d1ck dark
Not a single one of their songs has disappointed me. Especially now, all their music has an old vibe to it and it’s not like the music from other bands today. Very original and fantastic. I can’t get over how good your songs are and how people can make this band a meme. 😮‍💨
Muito boom
2:29 This segment is just awesome. What else to say?
Did anyone else notice that he is at Mandalay Bay in Shark Reef in Las Vegas
nice song
Another great song! Wish these guys would co.e to Minnesota
I don't know why but at the beginning of the music it looked like bones
Trouble Blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters Eat you alive Levels Better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil Butter to knife You think you're better than them Better than them You think they're really your friends Really your friends But when it comes to the end To the end You're just the same as them Same as them So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks He's comin' to get you (woo-woo) He's comin' to get you, get you (woo) Bubbles Drownin', you see in doubles Don't you let 'em see your struggles Hiding your tears Crisis Take advantage off your niceness Cut you up in even slices Prey on your fear You think you're better than them Better than them (you think you're better) You think they're really your friends Really your friends (really) But when it comes to the end To the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them Same as them So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows (ooh) You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything (Sharks) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks) Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me

the music video reminds me of Oceans 11,12,13 movie
I love how the name on the badge he wears is Dick Dark
NPC MUSIC
0:26 gives the vibes of Luke Evans meeting Jack Quaid from "The Boys" - whom Dan actually looks a bit like.
Imagine dragons are awesome with cool music
Cool
perfect as a villain song👌
So good
Your guys can’t make a bad song, I’m so glad I’m seeing you on my birthday you guys have been my idols since I was 5 <3 :)

Holy shit, this slaps HARD! Yet another Hit from Imagine Dragons!
💗SHARKS💗

0:15
why does this song suspiciously reminds me of the Bring it On 4 movie Shark Vs Jets cheer-off scene in the Alley 😂
The amount of hits this band has given is absolutely mind blowing,this song is a pure work of art, all the way from the lyrics to the tune it's HEAVENLY!!, the best things about Imagine Dragons is that all their songs are so well writen, this is literally poetry, the music video directed by Drew Kirsch is so well matched with the vibe of this song, definitely one of best looks of all the band members they look so damm cool kinda Bond-esque,I'll say it again THERE NEVER WAS, IS, OR EVER WILL BE A BAND LIKE IMAGINE DRAGONS!!!!!!
You are my light in the dark ..Thank you Imagine Dragons !! ✨💖🌈
Every song you record is a masterpiece! Thank you♥
Not even 30 seconds in and I love it
really good song but am i the only person thinking "why is there a casino connected to a theater connected to some over the top underwater shark tank that can release them litterly everywhere?"
All imagine dragons songs are the ONLY ones that please me there is just something about the other songs but imagine dragons is 1#

October with this song ❤❤
Unpopular opinion: I hate imagine dragons
Oh! A new good song at the radio!! ... mmh... let me know... IMAGINE DRAGONS! Ah ok... IT'S OBVIOUS!! 🤩✌🏻👍🏻
One of the better songs I've heard from ImagineDragons. It has a good balance of everything in the composition, and it's catchy.
Dunno why? I just think of crypto scammers when listening to this song.
They are "IMAGINE DRAGONS" but they haven't made a song on IMAGINATION or DRAGONS🙂.
✨💝 Great song - link to everyday life .. it's all so true, and music is wonderful .. makes me feeleng so good.  Thank you Imagine Dragons 💝✨
Muito bom cara, viciei d+
when death
I've been into Imagine Dragons since Night Visions era. Good to know their still making top tier songs ❤ ❤
Al principio parece Shakira - las de la intuición

This song is sponsored by Samsung Fold
🇹🇷 cok güzel şarkı
Mercury is probably the best music album of Imagine Dragon you still my favorite band
Okay, so I really loved the song, but I'm a little confused by the end of the video. What exactly were they trying to do by breaking into the casino and freeing the sharks?
I like how they got Cirque du Soleil in their video....very cool
What does lever do?
Imagine dragons is that mainstay band that people wanna hate but we can’t
Masno fest song

Aa 10 gün önce cikmis
Mv çok iyi olmuş bence şarkı da çok güzel zaten
This song fits perfectly for a st on the boys current season

Any guesses for the storyline of this music vid? Like what they were doing and trying to accomplish and theories as to why. Edit: also metaphors and such

Special version https://youtu.be/iTce7Ilo_V0
The only band that never disappoint.
My friend made me listen to this song. It sounds so well! I feel like dancing!
Was this sponsored by Samsung by any chance? They show the Samsung Galaxy fold rather prominently, but might be coincidence.
why free the sharks tho
Who was the pilot for the fpv shots?
That’s freaking good! 🤩✌🏼🔥

The music of imagine dragon is fantastic
Trouble Blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters Eat you alive Levels Better put your head on swivels Dancing with the very devil Butter to knife You think you're better than them Better than them You think they're really your friends Really your friends But when it comes to the end To the end You're just the same as them Same as them So let it go, let it go That's just the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks He's comin' to get you (woo-woo) He's comin' to get you, get you (woo) Bubbles Drownin', you see in doubles Don't you let 'em see your struggles Hiding your tears Crisis Take advantage off your niceness Cut you up in even slices Prey up on your fear You think you're better than them Better than them (you think you're better) You think they're really your friends Really your friends (really) But when it comes to the end To the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them Same as them So let it go, let it go That's just the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Every time my heart is beating, I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right in front of me Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything (Sharks) Don't take it from me My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (sharks) Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything So let it go, let it go That's just the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimmin' with sharks Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's comin' to get you, get you) Don't take it from me

"Yesterday is history" "Tommorow is mystery" "But today is gift " "That's why we called as present "
This is what Deep wanted to do but failed.
😍😍😍😍😍
This fits with the vibe of about a million movies
Dragon fans from India, Kerala❤️🥰
It amazing no doubt about but it doesn’t have that kick but The background music is really good but the lyrics kind of doesn’t make anything  Lyrics 8/10 Background music 9/10 😅👌🏼 but it’s still pretty good
🇺🇦🇺🇦🫡
فرقتي المفضلة 😍😍😍🤩
this is categorized with crap dont come for me
Yes Jason Matthew jay ethier The one play jaystationyt 3am  is my boyfriend in real life I'm coming get you

Imagine Dragons are the best when it comes to using Metaphors and making the lyrics spit out emotions "Bad Liar" has the best lyrics I thought, but I am changing my opinion
no me decepciona con las canciones
U guys are so great love you'll 💜💜
sheeesh💛💛
Mais uma para a playlist.
Me encantó
❤️
Hola queridos dragoncitos, quiero invitarlos a tocar en mi cumple aquí en Iztapalapa, mi jefa va a hacer pozole de lavadero y mi tía va a llevar panuchos yucatecos, yo paso por ustedes al metro consti, de ahí ya está cerca, mis valedores ya llevan el pomo y chelas. Si no tienen donde quedarse ahí nos acomodamos aunque me la quiero amanecer, espero su respuesta, cuídense y no le den de tomar mucho al Platz, se pone mala copa.
Tô viciado nessa música. Imagine Dragons são os melhores✨

Hate to say it but i dont like the new album
Ocean's Eleven vibe right there! Love it!
Love it
Well done. Also, kind of reminds me a tiny bit of Michael Jackson's album "Dangerous." Imagine Dragons never disappoints. I hope you're around for a very, very long time.
not their best work
saudade de quando vcs faziam musicas de verdade, dps de smoke and mirrors(o que na minha opinião foi o apice de vcs) foi só ladeira a baixo
This sh*t is so good
So beautiful 🤍
A perfecto music

I love the part with the green lasers. It's cool & ridiculous.
Great song  You’re amazing

Love you imagine dragons

Imagine Dragons é simplesmente a banda mais abençoada do mundo, eles nunca erram <3
After 3 years, I'll revisit this comment to reminisce
¡Quiero una gira por Centroamerica! Especificamente en C.R
You think you're better than them You think they're really your friends But when it comes to the end  You're just the same as them . *this is what going in my life right now*
Conor McGregor is that you? 😂

Every song they make are amazing! ❤️
They never disappoint us💆
Locate yourselves
First time listening to it. Have to say one of their best songs ever made
I was being thinking about this song can be jaws (Bruce’s) theme song I can understand the lyrics and it actually matches the shark character from “Jaws” :D  This song totally matches Bruce (please agree to me)
only took like 5 years for new songs
Another lit song nice guys
💖
Imagine Dragons...always amaze us...lol and respect for you guys...💖💖
7 days ago and it’s still lit 🔥
Soy el único que piensa que se parece a bones (la tonadita) 😅
Seeing him in the Bones music video and then this is so jarring
Wake me up when Imagine Dragons releases a Bad song
ANOTHER BANGER!!!
Не ожидал от вас, что вы будете использовать политику в музыке. Видео в моей стране они запретили... Вы думаете, что мы не сможем посмотреть с VPN?
Sick
Ya son LEYENDA
Wooop woop😂 honestly it's funny but may favorite part
Lembre-se de mim,pois logo serei esquecido no mundo dos comentários...
Se pasaron con Sharks, esta preciosísima la cancion 😞👌
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Im in love with this
Like si escuchas esto en 2022 !
Imagine Dragons has disappointed me. Each song is stinky and i dont like it!!!!! and bursts with stinkyness!!!
i hear @finneas production style .. it only needs @eminem 's personality (marketing wise) great song non the less ^^
hola🥬💒🌝📼
Please come to Malaysia i’d die for youuuurr concertttt!!!
Temazooo
ก็มาดิๆๆ วู๊กๆ
Soy el unico que escucha el bajo que suena en bones???
Since you guys made "Sharks" , you must make "Fish"
I don't know why it's a meme to hate this band. Thank you for making every song a banger. Most bands I only like a few songs they do, but you guys always do good stuff.
This video must be a huge investment in terms of content, scenes and of course, the song is also very good
This song makes me 🔥 💯🌎
Karla DLR
vem dia 1 andaaaaa
Uh Oh here I got dancin' again lol. Imagine Dragons don't miss!😁😂🔥
Amooo
In a 10 day quarantine starting today for Covid, When the song goes up by a couple million views by the time it's over. Know I had it on repeat since day 1.
so incredible song and mv🥰
epic.
I wake up to the sounds
Booi
Came from the YTS.  Boy, I don't know how I didn't listen when this first dropped! The message, just like all of Imagine Dragons' songs, sends chills down my spine and makes me think! ❤️
NEW MASTERPIECE OMG
The persons who write vas comments about imaginé dragons are not good persons or stupit
think about a colaboration with fortnite and make a show
A team of acitivsts pulling the daddiest of heists to free a bunch of sharks. I approve.
Que temon soy super fan de ustedes🤩🤩
Imagine Dragons is the type of band that always delivers good songs
I lOVE You Guys So Much! Thank You 🤗💋🤗💋
no entiendo pq aquí sale solo una canción y en Telegram ya están las demás del nuevo álbum
OH THE MISSOURI
¡Tremendo tema! Enganchado por todo, letra, ritmos, referencias. Mas no sé por qué siento que algunas entonaciones/sample me recuerdan a otra canción, sáquenme de dudas, por favor. No creo ser el único que siente haber oído el ritmo en algún otro lado. Jajaja P.D.: No me funen, solo quiero saber si estoy loco o no. :)
A melody that would never have been found.
Sharks are my favorite animals 😍 ❤️
This is good but I want to see them try to make a better song then thunder
1st listen "hmm quite below average" 2nd listen "actually this is pretty good" 3rd listen  " *sharks!sharks!sharks!* "
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Magnifico tutto
Masterpiece anyway

It's a really good song but that scene with lasers is very disappointing
The best song of 2022 so far is Bones or Sharks?

I randomly came across this song on Spotify and instantly fell in love with it! 😻
That looks like the Shark Reef Aquarium at Mandalay Bay
Imagine Bones and Sharks.
"He's comin' to get you Chick, chicka, woo, woo He's comin' to get you, get Woo" Que música show!
Wow Cirque due Soleil with Imagine Dragons. I would definitely love to see more collaborations.
a piece of art
Already dropped a new fire song🔥🔥🔥
Si es que nunca decepcionan, son lo mejor que hay, no conozco ni una canción mala de ellos, puro arte hacen
Good song, but kind of a dumb lame video. Oh well, at least the song is decent. Peace and love from Australia.
amazing Dragon
Its just 6 days so there is hype . Wait till its 6 years that's when this song will be used in movies like the Casino Royale with the next James Bond. Dan is gonna be singing this song live across the U.S . And this video is gonna have 300 million views

This feels like the origin or solo mission of Shark from Bad Guys.
These guys play league
I may or may not have been obsessively playing this song since it came out 👀
Missing some Dan's screaming in this song.

The more I listen to the song and watch the clip, the more I understand the clip. It has real art inside, and I felt it. So thank you Imagine Dragons once, ONCE *again!*
NICE
I just realized at 1:06, I think the guy talking synchs with the 'woo woo'
Fuera sido genial , que estuviera montado en un tiburón xD
I feel like this song is based of everyday life, how both sides feel in an argument or a fake friendship, to realize that ur not the good or bad one that both sides r the same.
IMAGINE SHARKS! LMAO!
They are amazing
Started like las de la intuition- shakira lol  https://youtu.be/GKlpL4FhzUs
Great song🔥.  And amazing concert in Prague btw, hope to see you soon here again!
Боже, это так прекрасно ~✨✨✨  С нетерпением жду следующих песен...💞💖✨💖🦖🌼💞✨
They are the best jokes .thags why nevwr in billboard 2022.however this kind of old farfs who create problem for a teen should be abandoned
The song and the video. WOW
if you notice the outro music in BONES  is as same as the intro of SHARKS they do it like aseries not an album ..... they are actually a dragons not just imagination😈❤❤💜🐉
Mt bom
Nice.
So catchy reminds me of those bad lip sync reading yoda songs.
Not like Bones 🥲
The better version of Baby Shark
Imagine dragons is basically Nickleback.
Since day one I'm dragon
❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷
Like los verdaderos Fans de Imagine Dragons
THE BASS LINE HITS
another hit this summer :DDDD
1:42 - 1:58 This part and the music of this song feels similar to "Kate nahi Katt ta" Hindi song. Just listen to this part of that Hindi song (0:36 - 0:57). https://youtu.be/9FjuBvzF1E4
Menudo temazo 🥰🥰
Monday exists

I LOVE EVERY SINGLE SONG OF IMAGINE DRAGONSSSS AND IM SOOOO EXCITED FOR MERCURY ACT 2!!!!
Imagine Dragons has never disappointed me. Each song is a work of art and bursts with energy. The new album will be a masterpiece anyway.
Que buena musica que hacen por favor!!!! Mi bebé de un año y medio los ama, baila sus canciones y agita la cabeza tanto que llega a caerse jaja❤🎵
THE KING OF ROCK
Good song
Elvis just got beat by IMAGINE DRAGONS
This is the first time I see this music video and it's great... so funny😆
Everyone is talking about how good Imagine Dragons' songs are and I know, but it is not only their songs are cool but the names they gave them are just the coolest names they can get
Seeing the cast of  "O" by Cirque du Soleil in the official video was totally unexpected and made my day! Beautiful message for all the artists out there. Great song as usual.
and me over here oooh i wanna write them a song. . Picked up my pen and paper and the first lines are : This world had dinosaurs about 245 million yrs ago/ Now there's planes trains and people too . .
Ayh ayh ayhhh 😍💙
Its like if Muse married Pop music. I am diggggging it
A great work of art perfectly performed and done here........
i luv this song pls do more
Good❤️
RKO IN A SHARK
Actually i'm disappointed by this one .. I think the last ones they've gotten out have lost some of their initial vibes
RKO IN A SHARK
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Preedobar video, šteta što ne traje dulje😎👌
Howard wolowitz 1:01
مستحيل أن أحصل على أغنية سيئة من هذه الفرقة أبدا .
Temazoooooo es que es Goooddd siempre sacan unos temas buenisimos
Otra vez subieron doble el vídeo.... por qué.   ???!!!
C'est bien
Nice
how to interpret this song?
I was waiting for this 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
io aspetto ancora che fellate un ritornello
Soy el único que cuando escuchó el principio creyó que iba a empezar a cantar Shakira las de la intuición, es idéntico el inicio, será otro tono y otro instrumento pero es igual jajaja
cada que imagine dragons saca una cancion nueva es mas buena sige asi dan y tu banda
I love youu so muchhhhhh!!!!
Simplemente a melhor banda 😀
You guys always make amazing songs🥰🥰
omg well it's just incredible! as always at the height !!
las unicas canciones que me gustaron de este canal son: enemy y bones
oh really  I just fall in love with imagine dragons 😅 by the way this song is best I don't get any word to say this Thai it is how much good 👍
Those transitions and camera work are on another level
WOPP YEAH
LOL, until recently I hadn't realized that Mario updated his favorite way to tackle ED and it's a relief! Although what he previously suggested was pretty good, it was a real pain to follow... go'ogle Mario's Thunderous Erections, you'll see why it's so much easier and potent now!
This MV is soooo cool! Love the song as well!
I can't  stop  sing and dance all day . Let it go  :-)))
epic song
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I admit this is cool 🤭⚠️⚠️⚠️
Que canción mas Épica!! con un ritmazo bien bueno!!
que gran cancion
Wooooooooooo Very Good song
💜🤍❤🖤💗💚💛🔥
That video was hilarious.
Всегда люьил вашу группу, с самого детства. Но вы чертовы шовинисты. Вы много раз давали свои концерты в России и знаете как вас тут любят. А из-за тяжелой политической ситуации вы вредите мирным гражданам и своим фанатам. Кого вы спасли тем что заблокировали свои треки на территории России? Кроме как просто обибели невиновных фанатов.
Tamo   imagine dragons 🥰
We love you
Love
Love it
Kings
Good song
jajajaja bro, omg. this music is very súper útra mega pro
Also if you listen closely you'll hear the end of bones on sharks
💣💥🎼🎈

😍❤😘

Rolon
Beautiful Voices <3 Love you
after watching this  i'm gonna swim with sharks  bye bye
This was disappointing to say the least
wicked
Já perceberam que o baixo que toca no início da música tem o mesmo ritmo do baixo no final da música "Bones"?
has the same rhythm as bones
He looks like that guy who intentionally went near a strong dust devil.
I thought I've seen everything from Dan... Now he is fuckin screaming.... Hell... Is that man best singer in the world? Cause I am starting to think that. Seen them live in Prague while ago... Not a single false note.. Dan is simply a beast... Hell yeah... This is banger
a

🥰😘
good song imagine dragons
Ahh! I was just there!!! Majority of this song, including circus olay is familiar!
One of the best
Imagine Dragons still didn't make any bad tracks
i didn't expect this, absolute fire 🔥🔥🔥
Another great song added to my playlist
I really felt something wierd in my stomach in sec 0:18   😭
I can’t believe that your song may be bad, YOU ARE INCREDIBLE TALANTED💃🏼
It looks like a short version of Hitman 3
I guess I'm just not totally understanding this one yet.
Okay this is it, Imagine dragons are my all time fav band, they have never failed to impress, never. Love you guys
This should've been an intro song for Shark Tank.
😐 ♥️♥️💪📳🔊🔊🔊
que buena rola viejo
Bros actually did a GTA heist and I’m here for it😂
Woop woop!
Me sorprende como es que lo asen 😎
0:00 sounded like bones
pov sharks and dragons
This should be the theme for wwe money in the bank 2022
this is entertaining
It is my whole weekend in Vegas in one video! I just visited all these places a couple weeks ago! Thank you, guys!
Been on loop💓
Another banger as always
NEW SONG LETS GOOOO
The music video is soo coool
😻
baby shark doo doo doo doo
Es increible escuchar tantos comentarios español aquí- y algunos que parecen vientamitas^-^
This video reminds me of the movie Casino. Bones also seems like The Wolf of Wall Street.
For those wondering, the fountain at the end, is somewhere called the bellagio! in Las Vegas, they came to visit the bellagio for that probably, they explored the little gambling part too I think, they have a little area for that too. :)
cant wait to go to the concert at the rogers center its gonna be awesome
oog its funky lol
woop woop
3rd hit since enemy and im loving it
I love this songgggg
me: life is so bore ... Imagine dragons: We are here ....

This is a vibe B)
The energy of the song can make u stronger everytime you listen ❤️
Its the next fast n furious movie track or some Disney superhero movie track 😍😍😍😍 love u ID
Why why do you make such a good song and are still underrated?? Oh god please make him at least super famous
Haha, cool music! The hairstyle of Dan is much better than that of his in the Bones MV.
Nice song . This is my best song .i am a big fan of imagine dragons
That bassline at the beginning gave me massive Shakira - Las de la Intuición vibes, wtf LOL Anyway, great song, it's very groovy and feel good
Sponsered by samsung !!
The bass is similar to a part in Bones
🌹♥️ amazing how we can all relate to your lyrics... has different meaning for everyone... .. if your reading this your never alone ...
impressive
New song yesh Dan looking good still
Payday?
Waiting for Shark sing sharks
me encanta..............................
Im confused at the message, Is it against the rich? OR free the animals?
Love how much they have been challenging themselves as of late!!! Love this record, lived Mercury Act - 1, and looking forward to Act - 1!
AMAZING
Whoop Whoop 🦈 ❤️
Love the message of this song. I’ve definitely lost some friends cuz they turned out to be terrible, selfish people
Art 👏👏👏👏👏👏👌

Super cool video!!
Shots was the only song that i don't like from them but now i like
I love how goofy imagine dragons music videos are. they pull off this elaborate heist at a casino. but not for the money or treasure or anything. they do it to let out a bunch of sharks
I love the hate That i hate the love
The bass is too similar to a Shakira's song called "las de la intuición"
I don't know how they don't make a bad song and always changing the style and rhythm
Los mejor
imagine dragons is the best band that the world has nicknamed and it is not only heard in their music, but apart from what they have gone through they continue to move forward it would be nice if they made a movie
Melhor banda ♥️
"How many bangers you wanna produce?" Imagine Dragons be like: "YES!"
todas las canciones de Imagine Dragons es arte :D
Como le digo a esta banda/grupo  Todo lo que me hacen sentir sus canciones? AMO SU TRABAJO Y LOS AMO A ELLOS  Ojalá vuelvan a México CDMX espero algún día poder verlos 😍🥰🖤
justo medi cuenta:(
Dios que temazo!!!
I think this song makes more sense than anything great song
Imagine Dragons never fails
Who else didn't know this existed until they saw the add?
ME ENCANTAAAAAAA (I LIKEEEEEE)
This song is so easy for me to dance to! I love it! Never disappointed! I love you guys!
3:15 é tudooo!
Never a bad day for Imagine Dragons.
Imagine Dragons never make a bad song 🔥😩❤️
TEMAZO
El intro me recuerda a Bad Guys de Billie Elish, pero en general no puedo dejar de escuchar esta canción...🤩🤩🤩 Es q tiene un ritmo salsero super pegajoso. 🕺🕺🕺
Imagine dragons cada que saca una nueva cancion nunca nos decepcionan
Imagine dragons never gets old
This is so good. Very catchy and it's just feels true ✨❤️
Slaying as always
Just perfect songs.❤️ Imagine Dragons can only listen and listen.✨️
And again absolutely successful and real. Love it💯👍
ta piola
Why is there a link to another music video of another musician at 0:30 ?
It's real sharks?😱😱😱
Ha so it’s impossible to make a bad song
I tried this when I went to Vegas but I couldn't get a crew together and went solo. Didn't make it past the first guards. On the upside they're playing this song in the jail cell.
I get the feeling they might've gotten their inspiration for the MV from the Ocean's movies and I love it.
Muito boa ♥️♥️
Wow! Cirque du Soleil on the video! Amazing
Bones was honestly better
Imagine dragons fl❤️
So good 😊
WOOP WOOP
Son mejores que bad bunny
Pongase los audífonos o un parlante y sonara como nunca
awesome, like every song. different, but in a way that is awesome.
I'm in love😍🤤
I loved it😍 Imagine Dragons always with amazing songs ❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
What cd is this song?
Great job guys! I like how you did it. I see you filmed in Vegas as well
😎
bangers after bangers
Simplesmente incrível
Ya it is impossible for imagine dragons to make a bad song
Awesome as always
Espero no ser el único que el baile que hace para pasar los lásers en el 2:14 me hace acordar al baile de una niñera aprueba de balas en la parte donde tiene que pasar las trampas del final de la película
Great news songs i love that 😍😍
What a banger! Come to think of it, I don’t think Imagine Dragons has ever put out a bad song!
como podem sempre acertar?
🥰
Like michael jackson🤔
Guiño guiño para Samsung 😉
Can you make a duet with 21 pilots
"Sharks" and "Bones" are my absolute favorite songs by Imagine Dragons 🐉. You guys never disappoint with your amazing songs 👏 👏 👏
Every F time ... The song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Samsung product placement ahahah
A true work of art 👌😍👏 Imagine Dragons is just wonderful
imagine dragons never die
@imagine dragons please México 🙏 🙌
Masterpiece 🔥 🔥 🔥
Lately I can't imagine dragons.... cabello vs Eminem.... oh fob and all others ... reductive
What a tune and rhytm!!
Good song thank you
It seems like the first time I listen to an imagine dragons song I’m not very impressed but the second time I listen to it and afterwards I’m like this is my new favourite song for a few months. Does that happen to anyone else? (It’s unrelated to whether I watch the video the first time or not)
❤️
Oh dear, I will have it in my head until a new one comes out
Muito bom ❤️
Recombobulation
Amazing Song
I just loved ❤️❤️❤️
Why is this not s movie?
It's impossible, they did a contract with devil for sure
This song should have been in "the bad guys" movie because the song's story is like they planning a robbery and its more like they do in the bad guys movie
You guys look really nice in those suits! As successful as a new song!
Amazing!
wow such a commendable lyrics❤
Another masterpiece :)
Amazing!!!!
ONE OF THE BEST SONGS EVER!!!!
Amazing!! Magnífico!! 😍
I just checked on the stores and there won't a "Mercury Act 2" ????  I have to rebuy Act 1? What the hell is this shady business scheme?

Amazing. Love from Azerbaijan
I love imagineDragons
👍
The scene with lasers is kinda funny 🤣
Nope it has been proven they can't make a bad song.
*Hitman Multiplayer by Imagine Dragons*
The talent of Imagine Dragons is unbelievible. Just listening to their songs strengthens my mood when I'm feeling down.
Imagine Sharks
Es el mismo casino dónde Dean Lewis grabó Falling Up?
I remember when I was a kid in elementary school and teacher was showing us pictures with sizes of brains in different species. The smallest was that of a shark 🤣
I love how the nametag says "Dick Dark"
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🌈 l loved
I wonder a little what the whole Video means?!❤
Loved the song😙💓
O Imagine Dragons nunca lança música nova assim sem contexto, certeza que vem alguma coisa aí pela frente....esperem pra ver.

It’s gonna go to my forever list! 🥹
los dragines imaginarios me fascinan ugu #sharks gente malditos
I'm not biased to love all that you give, now am I?
Nostalgia
Your songs have Ricky Martin nostalgic feelings
Why I can’t find this song in Apple Music?
I don't know why I only heard about Love Loud and the band's support for religious love for diverse sexualities. Once I knew, I grew to love ID more. Had to watch the mv as soon as I saw it. Love the songs, keep going!
Best song in the world
Heist movie! I love it!
Epic. Like all their songs!🔥
I love it Daaan!
Good song ❤
I <3 imagine dragons
Take advantage of your niceness?! I thought he said nice ass.. xD
Great work !!!!
They fucking done it again! <3
Is it only me who comments in English?
I'm scared of sharks." Like had to look away at the end" scared.  But still couldn't miss the vid.  You're still my number 1.
Ocean 11? ocean 12🤔🤔
Owwwwwww..... Imagine dragons copying Bollywood these days 🤣🤣🤣🤣 LOL.... Check out this song for proof --- https://youtu.be/viBaS0fKPGc
This song reminds me of something I heard very long time ago. I mean chorus melody is kinda childish. Mayby it was a children's show, mayby something else. Someone have any idea?
Muito bom🤘
Always blow mind.
This music video looks like it has much of influence from Oceans movies. Also some Shark tank vibes
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Best song 😈🦈
Holy fuck, this is definetely their year ;_; <3
I saw you boys about a week ago and you were amazing. Now I have to see you again to see you perform this new amazing song. O well! :P
جامد كيك
Like Ocean movie
This video is awesome too just like the song
This singer looks like cgi  Character  They used arcane model?
stop.
This song is such a banger, I hope I will hear it during opener in Gdynia 🔥🔥🔥🔥
와 신곡 ㄹㅈㄷ imagine dragon 짱짱
The ending isn't so sweet tho. It's like an attempt to gain your trust and trick ya by the end with making you think this is the right option. Also those subliminals kind of whack, trying to suggest trust what you're seeing kind of bs. Paleeease, this is like 7 months too late for gullibleness to rise up in me now. Emf my middle finger onto some instrument.. or something, idk I went off a lot today already, I don't have a good closing statement or word. Oh, bird, the bird is the word!!
https://youtu.be/CUdA8dEQu_E
I love Imagine Dragons ❤️

It's a great song to listen to
Imagine dragons makes a certain tone to their music that makes me think I already listen to it back when radioactive and I bet my life was really popular and I really love it cause it's nostalgic too me😁
I'm surprised to find I like this song. Not what I expected from them. Especially the ending.

After I saw them live I can confirm that if you are a fan and they are touring in your city, you should buy tickets
Another masterpiece added to history
I'm not good in English but their songs holding me
A new legend of ImagineDragons was born
Increíble como todo lo que crean, ídolos
The real question is who "Dick Dark" is....1:31
Imagine dragons never disappoint us with their music

Amazing 🥽
İ'll never be suprized when hear a good song 'cause they do this all time <3
Wow dragons singing the shark song 😂😂
Wow parece GTA V asombroso
New favourite ❤️
Omg each note that cuts right through the last one precisely, just enough rythming, doesnt feel rapid,yet isnt slow paced, got a feeling of R&B mixed with jazz , very unexpected from imagine dragons usual loud and strong style, but is truly a masterpiece
The videoclip reminds me Ocean's 11-13 movies with Clooney and Pitt.
Nunca fazem músicas ruins
Is this about Loan sharks?
❤
I didn't dissappoint again
They are on a heist like that to steal my heart
O clipe tá a cara do filme do George Clooney Ocean's Eleven kkkkk
Santiago de Compostela 11/07 🤩🤩

love you from 🇮🇷
Disappointment isn't never the word for imagine dragons 🖤🖤🖤🖤 just loved it
❤️❤️❤️
My comment is the only one in English.
I know some dont want to hear this but it needs to be said..For the rapper, drug dealer, prostitute, homosexual, partier, fornicator, drinker, drug user..Jesus is willing to accept you just the way you are.. Jesus died for all those and every sin and all a person has to do is believe he died or all your sins (past present and future) and you are justified in the eyes of God and will have a relationship with him forever
it's alright, better than the average new mainstream.... but thats not saying much. meh
When I listened to it for the first time I was like alright nice song but after listening for 20 I'm like damn this is amazing dude

Лайк, если любите свою маму!
Лайк если любите свою
Fuck yea love it  Man 🍻
Cada nueva canción es una obra maestra, en fin ImagineDragons la mejor banda.
All that elaborate effort - not to steal money, oh no! Pfft! What's money compared to how cool you'd look surfboarding in a Vegas casino fountain lake with sharks?  GENIUS.
Big fan love your music
Why is there a lack of comments in English? Me and mates attended the European tour of Imagine Dragons which held place in Riga, Latvia. Ca 60000 of visitors. Fantastic.
esto no es como la peli esa q ni idea del nombre xd
raaaaaaaaa
I just saw you guys live. Best live experience by a long shot. Keep doing what your doing.
simplemente Perfecto :3
1:30 espera khe?
#GODKNOWS #GODJUDGED #GODWINS WE R #ONE
Damn, your every song is my "new favorite" xD

És incrible imagine dragons
Imagine dragons e  incrível eu amo vcs😍❤️
There’s just Spanish on the Imagine Dragons comments !!!!
Hi, From Brazil ❤️🇧🇷 Love'us!
This is a banger
I'm diggin this!!?
Why are almost all the top comments in spanish x3 this is new to me haha
Como siempre emocionada cada vez que esos señores suben una nueva obra de arte!
Everything that this group puts out is amazing!!! Each and every song is different from the last!!! True talent gifted individuals!!!

BEWARE THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN USELESS INFORMATION. It is and lately mainstream music seems to relate to things happening in my sensitive narrow view eyes. Anyone who knows is homeless. Controlling countries from shadow pretending to work at home no money limit brand new vehicles. Watch around you theatricals everywhere. You are watched always and people will go anywhere you go. You don beleivinnin what you can't see so hide the crime beleivinnin the world is good. Help project happiness creativity and working together to pay it forward. There's always a constant battle unseen when you are too busy but nobody an afford to be not busy.
Me pregunto dónde estaré en 5 años
Imagine Dragons son los mejores
¡Muchas Gracias Imagine Dragons por traernos tan buena música! Los escucho desde hace varios años ya y cada vez que sacan nuevo tema me sorprenden una vez más, muchos saludos desde Argentina 😁🇦🇷
Better then bones braaaaa so good
Images dragon is a legend
put this on 1.25x speed trust me
Awesome song. Video gives the spy move vibe. Love the control panel he pulls, anyone know who was behind the art/prop making cause that panel look legit? Would like to follow their work.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Can someone tell me what the storyline of the video was?
Amazing
I love Imagine Dragons ❤️🐲👏🦈🦈🦈🐉👏👏👏🦈👏🦈👏🦈🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

References from Oceans and Casino…
2:17 to 2:31 was so funny
Oh  i really like their bones, and natural, all of theolir songs, and their big drum! I love them! Very dedicated to their fans, and especially to their family. I don't know if they are Christian or what, but very very respectful band 😍

My darling boy never gives us  a bad song
IMAGINE DRAGONS ROCKS 😀
Im glad they're getting even more recognition for their work :D they deserve all the attention they're getting now That and they've always been popular :>
2:36 **Dan pulls the lever**  The sign: Am I a joke to you?
I don’t think mercury is their best work, I like their stuff before more but this, bones and Enemy is some of the best stuff they’ve made lately.

Trouble Blood is in the rocky waters Hide away your sons and daughters Eat you alive (Eat you alive) Levels (Levels) Better put your head on swivels (Swivels) Dancing with the very devil (Devil) Butter to knife (Butter to knife)  You think you're better than them Better than them You think they're really your friends Really your friends But when it comes to the end To the end You're just the same as them Same as them  So let it go, let it go That's just the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimming with sharks  He's coming to get you (woo-woo) He's coming to get you, get you (woo)  Bubbles Trying to see in doubles Don't you let them see your struggles Hiding your tears Crisis Take advandage off your niceness Cut you up on even slices Prey up on your fear  You think you're better than them Better than them (you think you're better) You think they're really your friends Really your friends But when it comes to the end To the end (oh, no) You're just the same as them Same as them  So let it go, let it go That's just the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimming with sharks  Your blood is pumping (he's coming to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's coming to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's coming to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's coming to get you, get you) Don't take it from me  Everytime my heart is beating I can feel the recipe I wonder if my day is gonna blame it on the entropy My blood is pumping, I can see the end is right infront of me Don't take it from me, I could be everything Everyday (Sharks!)

1:29 sus 😳
Why did you block access for Russia? You don't appreciate your fans from Russia? If this is such a "sign" in support of Ukraine, then it is absolutely useless, it only makes you worse, as you simply lose views and audience. And for your information, many Russians are also against the war, just like you, so I don't see any point in blocking the video for any particular country. That's what I didn't expect...
another masterpiece of this great group
https://youtu.be/XZc3kTVtuM0 Dv
Como sempre os melhores não erra uma 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷💕😘
I literally didn’t understand what I watched until I watched it.💀

Es increible como todavia hacen canciones tan cheveres Imagine Dragons nunca pasara de moda♡
Hi Wayne! I heard you loved the redvelvet cake :) that I made with mine team. have a great day and this song oefff😍😍
The song is sub-par but still enjoyable, great music videos tho!
This is good.
❤️
Decent song. Not one of my favorites but i can see why people would like it. I think the reason why I don’t like this to the level of bones (currently my favorite song of theirs) is at 2:14. Reminds me of cutthroat which is one of their songs that I think is terrible.
Onerepublic Coldplay Imagine dragons entregam tudo sério 🔥🔥🔥🔥😍🇧🇷
You got it
Cadê os fãs brasileiros 🇧🇷😍😍😍😍😍

Perfect as always you been but this one is really Perfect ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥

He just did the "millennial woop" to reinforce his pop stardom.
I love it🤤😍
It's amazing as always . Imagine dragons never let us down👍
We live in a world of sharks. Spirituality is being in sea of sharks with protection, and a spear.
You are awesome guys, I started listening you in 2015. And ever since then you are my favorite band and I wait your songs to come out. YOU ROCK.❤❤❤❤
CdS AND Imagine Dragons??! Oh yeah boys, we stay winning

What a load of sht 😂
these guys are so popular that if you try to get the lead singer one of the questions is “is your character radioactive”
Imagine going to the Bellagio to see the water show and see some random man skiing across the water and then realize that’s Dan from imagine Dragons 😂
speed x 1.25 🔥🔥🔥
🦈🤟🔥🖤 I LOVE IT! ❤
So happy i grew up listening to their songs...  ID will always have a special place in my heart. ♥️🌈♥️

Great Samsung commercial (I love Samsung and I love Imagine Dragons even more)
1 bilhão???
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
First five words prove it's a hit
Wow now Ocean Eleven
Here is a tip and btw I’m such a long time watcher  that I don’t remember how long I was here but here is the tip: see how your past videos are going  but how about you try to do something like believer! Believer has 2.2Billion views so maybe if you do something like that then you can get more views and likes? I really don’t know I’m not that good with tips but good luck imagine dragons with the career- and I hope you have a good day the person reading this.
IMAGINE NEVER DISSAPOINT

You should be afraid if you're in the ocean and don't see sharks. — Sylvia Earle
Always creative! Always the best ...   Their talent is one of the best in the world. Anything they do  - is impeccable! 😍😍
❤️🦈
My husband and I were planning to attend Imagine Dragons' concert in Kyiv in June... It was my true dream, which didn't come true because of the ugly war that Russia began in my country. Now my husband is in the army and every day I pray for him... Anyway, dreams do come true. We just have to win and then Imagine Dragons will come to my country again!:)
The new single is best😁sorry for my english i’m czech
❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Me encanta la emotividad de fondo como va creciendo, nunca decepcionan <3, verlos en vivo fue de las mejores experiencias que tuve

BUENISIMAAA❤️
Awesome!💚💚
😍😍😍😍
Somos tendencia en México 🇲🇽  Sigan reproduciendo
imagine dragons is the best their songs never fail to amaze me
It's not bad, for what it is, but I seriously doubt it'll be one of the songs that pushes their new album dropping in a week and whenever a greatest hits album is offered by them, if this is on it, it'll only be because it's like a half dozen disc collection. Seriously, this isn't bad, really it isn't, but go back to Demons, Believer, Thunder, Radioactive, even more recently with Wrecked, this isn't among the best that this group is known to put out. It's average at best. Score it a B-, or barely 3 stars, a 4.5 out of 10.
i was just in vegas a few days ago!
Simplemente magnífica
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Seguiré creyendo que no hay una canción mala de imagine dragons hasta la tumba.
🙂😀😃😄cool 👍 🥰
This man always tries to do something and extra ordinary and make his audience fell excited for every next, love you  ❤️❤️❤️❤️.
Amazing.
This is gonna be BIG

I started to love Imagine Dragons since 'Demons' and 'radio active' when I was 14 years old. 10 years passed and I still am here. I am pretty sure I will find my way back here to the day I die.❤
It's just a masterpiece 💎💙
I think i somehow screwed up my YouTube, 90% of the comments are in Spanish? Did I flip a filter somewhere??
This song is so true
I'm confused, why does he start in the football stadium? Can someone plz explain?
Deberían poner una advertencia de adicción, este tema es demasiado adictivo
Love the song.
🤠
So nice... ❤️❤️

Os caras não cansam de fazer música perfeita

يا ناس يا عرب ي خلق الله ي هيه يا هيه ترى ولاية سناو العالمية بقعتن باردهه عليها رضوان من الله
2:14 his voice when background music stops is most satisfying 😍
Extraordinary visuals  😍 & Lyrics epic  🥲❤️ . . . #Banger 🔥🔥🔥
2:30 Every time he shouts i feel blood in my veins
"Do not pull" for the win.
Imagine Dragons breath and make a hit. Hahaha That's not easy and I'm sure that y'all have worked a lot to get there, this well deserved place. One of the greatest of music. U doesn't ever disappoint. ❤️❤️❤️❤️

This song is just...BEAUTIFUL!!
“Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” Acts 2:38-39 KJV   “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” John 14:6 KJV   “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3:36 KJV   “For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.” Matthew 6:14-15 KJV  “And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” Luke 11:9-13 KJV  “And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.” John 6:35-40 KJV   “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.” Matthew 10:28-31 KJV  “Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.” Matthew 10:32-33 KJV   “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Romans 10:9-13 KJV   “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” John 3:5-6 KJV  “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.” Colossians 1:13-20 KJV   “Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”  2 Philippians 2:4-11 KJV   “Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” Matthew 6:1-21 KJV

Dios que gran canción, me gusta este tipo de ritmo y tono, tanto en bones como en Sharks, algo también que nunca decepciona es los videoclips, este me gustó incluso más que el de Bones que ya era buenísimo por la coreografía de los zombies  Pero aquí el vestuario de todos la expresiones y toda la escena se siente tal cual en una película, me gustó muchísimo de verdad
History is a lot like Imagine Dragons...  It's repetitive, never really good, and somehow only getting worse.

Imagine Dragons has been my favorite band for 10 years now. I still remember the first time I heard their music. That’s how each and every song makes me feel every time I listen to them. It’s been a pleasure growing up with you.   Once again, you’ve made my day. 🦈👊🏻💙
Been here and will always be
It's like they always know what to release when I need it most
Music perfect
You are literally the soundtrack to our lives

Te amo imagine Dragons 💗
Adoro este nuevos ritmos en sus canciones, son bastante peculiares pero a la vez pegadizas, al igual que Bones. Me encantan~ 🛐
never disappoint.
Sick music. Nice energy as Usual. You give me hopes for the future of music
COME TO BRAZIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Strange, this song is a bit disappointing and boy-bandish in its lyrics and composition. Maybe I'm missing something, but it just does not seem like ID music or video. Anyone else weighing in here?
apenas os melhores, eu amo muito essa banda é a minha favorita. não tem uma música deles que eu não goste mdsssss ❤️‍🔥 a melodia, a voz do dan, a produção do clipe mdsssss tá tudo lindooooo
awesome
This music is a like 10000000/10
Siempre sorprendiendonos con algo nuevo, demostrando que son la mejor banda ❤
esta cancion recuerda una banda a las antiguas de imagine dragons y recupera su estilo clasico no como hiso con bones o enemy
no words for this 🤩🤩🤩🤩
That was amazing 👏
Curt, but not skirt.
Now I wanna go to vegas : /
Son magnificos y siempre me dejan con ganas de mas y nunca me defraudan💯💯💯💯❤❤
🦈🦈🦈
Як ви це робите? Кожна пісня- у саме серце 💙💛я шанувальниця Вашої творчості вже багато років.  І коли я думала, що неможливо любити вас більше, ніж вже є- ви виходите на один із своїх концертів з прапором України 🇺🇦.
In love 🔥
Another good song, keep it going!

I love how catchy the song is.  Pretty much every song that Imagine Dragons has done has been a banger
I love it 💙🦈
Cool and funny
todo lo que sacan es arte, nunca dejan de innovar, los amoo
If you don't like it, just wait ... They'll grow on you. ID always does that ... ❤️
Catchy song.  What does Dirk Dark refer to on his nametag @ 1:30? Also, see a Tesla Model 3 @ 3:27 (nice to see more EV's in music vids).   Looks like mine but wrong state.
I passed out while listening. These people are interpreters of repressed emotions. All the suppressed emotions inside you come to life here
One of your best songs
Another historical song made by the magical imagine dragons 🎉🫶🏼🎉
vivo por su música
Sizi dinlemek bana herzaman keyif veriyor ama böyle uydurma hikayelerdense içinizdeki çılgınlığın dışavurumunu gösterdiğiniz parcalar benim için çok daha değerli :)
Excellent
Wow really nice, I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

shark
The song was awesome as usual🔥🔥 and the whole video was shot really well but that drone shot of Eiffel tower at 2:47 was another level. Hats off to the director, imagine dragons and the whole team
I just noticed something. Earlier in their live Platzman said he told his parents he wanted to play the violin and Dan just walked by a bunch of people playing the violin. I think that means something but I’m not sure.
Woow, amazing!! Love it 💕💕💕
🤩🦈🦈
Those Samsung flexes tho! I love it. ❤️

Imagine Dragons 1 Depresión 0  💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I cannot decide Bones or Sharks
Me: going to swim on a beach where there is a sign of "caution sharks" (while people stopping me)  Imagine dragons : "Let it go , Let it go , That's the way it goes"
Saya nonton band ini makin lama kok makin keliatan aura 🌈  Jadi ragu saya sama otot-otot dan kemacoan group ini.
Everytime they drop a new song i say that there is no way i will like it as much as their other songs but then i find out that I’m wrong
200к в первые часы,капец вы низко пали
Buenísima esta producción me encanta 👌
Another song filled with great lyrics from great dragons
This would be perfect for the Meg 2
Я здесь был.
like every song  from you its perfect but i think its not  one of your top songs
VIDEO OF THE YEAR
I'm just imagining Bruce, the shark (from Jaws, not Finding Nemo) vibing with this song, like, "Yeah, I'm comin' to get you."
shoulda got an NFT in there
So close to memorizing this masterpiece! I love it! It’s so cool!
Bones then this song, the video is more interesting than the song
PERFECT
Mano que música perfeita 💜💜 O imagine Dragons nunca desilude, sinceramente é só um hino atrás de outro🛐🛐🙇🏽‍♀️💜
Genial! Como todos sus temas.
Every song what this men show is very impresionant
With ♥️ from 🇺🇦
el profe explicando ahora mismo no se q vg de ley de ondas:😴😴😴  sharks de imagine dragons en plena clase:🧐🍷
Elle est entrainante comme musique ! Et elle reste en tête xD  Let it goooo ! Merci Imagine Dragons <3
Guys, you are just amazing. I love how your songs are all beautiful, expecially for the music that goes with the song. Keep going on this way. Kisses from Italy👌🏻🇮🇹
I was at a concert in Vienna yesterday
It is one of the many songs they made that deserves to be the main song in a movie
✨Perfect ✨
20 de 10 y god
Fire song
This song slaps I could listen to this all day! Imagine Dragons never disappoints us 🔥 ❤
Saludo desde Honduras 🇭🇳🇭🇳🇭🇳🇭🇳

Una verdadera joya. Te amo Imagine Dragons, vivo para adorarlos 💗🇲🇽
The best band!
Another Great Song!!
They're back 😍
❤️❤️❤️
That’s awesome the theater this takes place in is a show in VEGAS CALLED “O”
🔥💖
They are always awesome 😏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 never ever they disappoints us …… their wording of songs is something that makes u their fan….. 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Amazing, but I need some explanation for what the song is talking about 😅
相変わらず最高まじで好き❤️
So who r the sharks?? I think Imagine dragon wants to tell Fake friends and fake loves are the Sharks
Wow all these new songs coming out are great! It's wild though, in my mind Origins is still the "new album"  Also, reminded me a bit of the Ocean's 11 movie, and Ocean's 12, especially with the lasers...
Yet another great song by my favorite band
Amazing, no more words.
❤️❤️🔥👍
Imagine dragons never fail in making great music video ever since Night Visions
Почему нельзя было сделать открытым видео в России.
This is so amazing! Reminds me of Six of Crows a bit with the video. As usual Imagine Dragons outdone themselves.
Food for thought  nice lyrics
I had high expectations for this song, and they've exceeded it brilliantly once again ❤🦈
Love From INDIA....😍😍😍😍😍😍
One of the best tracks by Imagine Dragons
Up till this day they didn't make a song i didn't like i love you imagine dragons and i will listen to your music no matter what ☺️
Bones nie przebije

I was already excited for Mercury Acts 1+2 but now I'm even more excited
i just want to feel happy while listening to this song
I've seen them 3 times so far, the most recent being in February for their Mercury tour. Each concert was spectacular, they are my all time favorite band! I even got to shake Dan's hand ❤
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ :)
Cool! His every music is great!
I'm proud not to hear about their songs from tik tok
WOW encore une musique au top! je ne serai jamais déçu par ce groupe! la nuance de cette musique est vraiment spécial et c'est la chose que j'aime le plus je pense....
Yo soy el like número 586
Egypt is dark without imagine dragons's songs 😅

MANO ESSA MUSICA MDS CARA, CLIPE A LETRA A MUSICA, TUDO PERFEITO
This song emits an effective singularity and motivates to continue, forge and make what is longed for come true.
I'm sorry but not a huge fan of this one, hope the rest of the album is better
BOP ❤❤ LIT ❤❤
They never failed us 🖤❤🦈
Birds was a great song, Sharks is an amazing song, Imagine Dragons!

Sin la música la vida sería un error».- Friedrich Nietzsche . Amo la frase , pero es mi deber corregirla" Sin imagine Dragons la vida sería un error "
A mi la musica me suena a Bad Guy de Billie Eilish 🤔
I'm not kidding, I predicted this song 3 months ago, I remember that I told my brothers that I would like Imagine Dragons to make a song with that title and thank God it came true 🦈
Every Imagine Dragon's single release never dissapoint me. 🥰
Another success, thanks Image Dragons!!!🤗💖👏👏👏
There's a reason why Imagine Dragons are the best 😍🤩😍😍
Imagine dragging these nuts across your face

Son los mejores Hacen que mi corazón mexicano lata por ustedes🇲🇽 ❤️🥺
How is every song from this band legendary? I guess this band is legendary!
I think it’s impossible for Imagine Dragons to make a bad song
I’m properly terrified of sharks & that shark close up (with the teeth) towards the end made me jump but I love the song. Another classic!
Another master piece of music
The music was awesome,as always and the music video was some fine work too.
Another ID masterpiece! Amazing song, great video. Can't wait til the whole album comes out <3
Medio tiktok buscando como loco que trozo de serie, pelicula o clip le van a pegar la canción*
You rock it man awesome beat
“Imagine Dragons is not a band. It is a feeling of hope, happiness, sadness and vulnerability. It isn’t a face or a person. It is an emotion that resonates in your ear and spirit.“ August 2020,  Dan Reynolds 🐉❤️
I love you and your songs. Each is different and each has its own charm. I can listen to you all the time, it makes me feel better 😁❤

ELES SÃO INCRÍVEIS DEMAISSS Não tá escrito o quanto eu amo Imagine Dragons ❤️😍
Sheeeeeshhhhh
I love imagine dragons, it’s my favourite group of music actually but I prefer their rock music a lot more than their pop era now. Like that AMAZING yells he used to do in rock songs like Friction or dull knives. Please do a lot more rock songs please because I think I’m their biggest fan. Well maybe not but I really like your music. And if you don’t do more rock music I’ll still listen to imagine dragons so it’s just my suggestion. Love you!!! ☺️☺️☺️ :3
Las vegas😍😍
my favorite things imagine dragons and sharks. a perfect combination ufff
I love them guys. They Just can't disappoint. 😍❤️‍🔥💣
最高すぎる！！！めっちゃオシャレでかっこいい！ これからもがんばって
100$ this music is going to be in a shark movie

BEAUTIFUL (I'M FROM ITALIAN NO ENGLISH)
It's a beautiful song, Imagine Dragons is my favorite band for eight years 💖💖💖
Whoa, Imagine Dragons are on fire nowadays! First Bones and now Sharks!! Also, was anybody else reminded of "Ocean's 11" from this music video?
This is very good!

Best songs ever of you imagine dragons
Los fans de dragones imaginarios cuando suena :
im here
Imagine dragons lo hiciste de nuevo, creaste otra obra maestra
KEREN GAK ADA OBAT!!
Por ustedes vivooooooooo
Another masterpiece from the masters.... As always never got disappointed by there songs as they come back after some time from Enemy and then Bones and SHARKS, all there songs are relatable to everyone and have some unique tones.... *The Best Band🖤🖤*    Edit :- There actings skills are also got improved from Mercury Act 1..... Didn't it???
Esta GOOD, no entendi nada pq no soy ingles pero aún así esta GOOOD, sigan asi ImgaineDragons.
wow
another masterpiece
WOW another amazing song, its unbelievable how much amazing music this band continues to make. love from Ireland 🇮🇪
Eu amo imagene dragon
Sin duda esto fue un impulso mas para la banda, AMEEEEEE esta cancion. Como siempre los dragoncitos trayendo joyas u.u
I was looking at the ten commandments last night and one of them says that u r not supposed to make any images of anything in heaven above or earth beneath. It seems that our lives r nothing but a steady stream of images ALL day, EVERY day. I hope I can b forgiven bc I think I'm starting to see y God doesn't want everyone obsessed with images. I've always liked imagine dragons, along with many other bands, but God is speaking to my heart about how far from God's creation plans we really r and that normal and natural r two totally different things.
Good song
Sponsored by Samsung !

I miss you that's cool

Don't take it from me My blood is pumping, my blood is pumping (Sharks!) Don't take it from me, I could be everything Everything  So let it go, let it go That's the way that it goes First you're in, then you're out Everybody knows You're hot, then you're cold You're a light in the dark Just you wait and you'll see That you're swimming with sharks  Your blood is pumping (he's coming to get you) Don't take it from me (woo-woo) Your blood is pumping (he's coming to get you, get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's coming to get you) Don't take it from me Your blood is pumping (he's coming to get you, get you) Don't take it from me

Banana
LATAM TOUR???
There are many artists and many singers and many bands but the energy this band has and the voice Dan got, is just flawless. Each of their songs can be related to life. The Best thing is they never use any swear words while many others do. That's why their songs are my favorite. Gotta admit their songs are the best. Yet most underrated band💔
