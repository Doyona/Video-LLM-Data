As much as I was supporting Micheal Smith, Clemens darts where absolutely solid in a lot of stages, credit to him.
Dimi is trash he always scared to throw at tops
for some reason everything about clemens annoys me to the max

So MVG will blow Smith away will he, how did that age for you all? I pointed out that Smith was the heavier scorer in the Semi's!
micheal smith did it👍👍he won the tittle
Thanx Bully for all the championship and for your wonderful darts. I'm very glad you won it and i'm happy for you. Happy new year. Me girl was for MVG😀😀😀😀

Worst final line-up ever, actually refusing to watch with them 2 disgusting, arrogant clowns. Snooker will always be better now.
If anyone watch the last game what was the Song that played before the players went on stage please
where can i watch the final? link...
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Vangerwin wins this final easy smith is a bottler and always will be.
een pak op zijn donder heeft hij van den bergh gegeven, en hij gaat ook de finale winnen
Van gerwen à un sacré problème d ego... je ne le supporte plus
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeey hey baby😮
MGV
Shame we have to pay to see it. (Netherlands) I never pay for TV stuff.
If Bully Boy can overcome the mental hurdles in the final he can win it. Cracker of a finale to come 🎯
Was waiting for dimitri to grab the mic. Then tell us how he just had his arse kicked 🤣🤣🤣
Damn damn
Have they been cloning Shrek ???
MVG just to good dimi outclassed
https://youtu.be/ns1aMPotCAA
Set up nicely for the Fat Bottler to do his thing again... Anyone noticed that DvB looks like Putin's son...?
Van den Bergh played a brilliant 3rd leg Finnish t20 t20 and bull
Which michael Smith or van gerwen
At one point vd Bergh looked like he was going to cry...
And now let's all hope Michael Smith shuts up bigmouth MVG.
I guarantee that Michael will become World Number 1
We dutch are the king of darts 💪
Anyway I think mvg will crack under pressure
Final... On a work day cmon whats occurring here, amateur hour this it really is, surely it should've been yesterday the Monday... What a waste of watching this last 2weeks has been 🤬🤬
If MVG flies out of the blocks tonight Smith will crap himself, get the shakes and goodnight Vienna.
When MVG is playing like this he sucks the air out of a match. This is the kind of form that had even Phil Taylor 'tanking' against him. Here, it was as if Dimi were a 'ghost' presence.
Mvg 🎯 🫡
Smith has won the last 3 meetings between the two. I think Smith wins it 7-5 or 7-6. Smith will have 20+ 180s
I feel for Dimi, if I'm playing an opponent so dominant I'll wanna end it after 5 legs.
how must smith feel knowing you have too fight against this beast
Dimitri didnt even play that bad but MVG was unstoppable
And DvB got what he deserved.......  dont shoot off youre big mouth if you cant bacl it up....  and them to start whining......... start to enjoy what you are doing..... maybe you get the results again......
MvG hasn't been challenged at all, the guy just doesn't give the opponent a chance and then they crumble, the only one who can give him a tough time it's Michael Smith, and in the final
This micheal final is gonna be great. Nice pace and energy from both guys
Mvg all the way
When VG is on his game he doesn't seem human
23:58 , that score, didn’t even know it was possible
Michael 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 vs Michael 🇳🇱, MVG will win 🏆🎖️🏅🥇🎯
Insane!
Smith will have to throw 110 average in order to win..
I hope Smith beats MVG. Smith just gets on with his game, no intimidation or encroaching like MVG did last night.
Can someone please tell me why mvg has to Has to stand on the red mat while the other dart player is throwing his darts
Just too good.
Will VdB and Clemens have a losers' final match?
Michael Smith got to be the best flowing throw on tour. Perfectly fluid and rythmic every time I love watching him.
Dimitri’s insecurity is off the charts😂
That's reason why is MVG no.1 on the Darts World 👍🎯 The best player ever I've seen 🇳🇱🇳🇱🏆🥇🥇🥇
Wow, wow, wow brilliant.
Cant wait to see the final !!
Please show handshake at the end
They've got to stop those idiots from whistling! I'm not playing and it puts me off!
Van Gerwen is also the kind of mind games. Love it.
Just think if MVG wins the final he will only need to win 10 more world championships to equal Phil Taylor.
i don't like DvdB attitude on the stage, ok he's hyprconcentrate, but...look down on the floor every time and keep on any emotions and on final moments pressure ate him...i think he could try something different. On his big fish he looked almost sad...c'mon man!
good god MVG is a machine poor Den was squashed like a bug
I reckon Michael Smith will win the final
Smith was incredible, so smooth, rapid and natural... MvG is on another planet right now, clinical and without any mercy. It will be a great final
Dream machine did Exceptional against a Living Legend 🟢 <—« 👌🏻✨😉 0:04
MVG this is legal?
The Erling Haaland of Darts , The Machine
Van De Berge got humble 😊
Always said it, he is at another level..the speed, the talent...to have played 22 legs, winning 18 of them and having a 108.28 average at the end of that..in a World Chapionship semi final.....no one has ever done that.
I think Smith has to bring his absolute best in the final, than maybe he has a chance.  If MvG brings his best than no chance for Smith.
Let's be honest: the two finalists haven't had the hardest of roads this year to reach the final ... Both their 1st "real" opponent is in the final.
highlights. 27 mins.  mini series u mean
Ahhhhh love mvg but sad for Dimitri  Whitewash is pain
WoOoOoOoW...blowing away Dobey and Dimi to zero...what a final in the waiting 👌💯
wow another mind blowing cool hand and mind, he is 100% focus , its going to be a great final, maybe he throw another 9 darts finish
Really hope bottle boy can get the job done
Anyone knows the odds for betting 6-0 to MVG? 🤭🤭🤭
MVG 🐐 in that form nobody gets near him🎯👌
MVG!!!!!!!!!
Smith’s finishing was epic 👌
Like Ronnie , Michael is in a different league
Svaka cast Clemens pruzio si dobar mec protiv velikog favorita respect
MVG looked like Slingblade at times.
Holy shit... Mvg totally crushed his opponent.... Was he really that good, or did the guy he played was totally off his game??  Score wise.. I think mvg has the best chance at becoming the world champion..
Майкл - Майкл!!!
Вот это финал будет!!!👍 Два монстра!!!)))
Van Gerwen vs Smith in the finals but this should be a rematch since 2019
Nice 170s from both Dimi and MvG and a sweet 161 from Smith! But the fact MvG won the 6 sets 3-2, 3-0, 3-0, 3-2, 3-0, 3-0.. that is frightening! 🤯
What can you do against that. Only Phil Taylor could compete with that.
Nah man Micheal is Going to win this for sureee
Looks like no nine darters this year then
Michael is going to win
Can't believe I'm saying this out loud but darts is getting boring with MvG lately
What a standard darts is nowadays it is scary. respect every single player all of them would destroy us armchair players. Pdc if you.are a  fan or not gotta respect where they have lifted darts to.
Cannot stand Smith dunno why he's just a bellend! Thinks he's well better then what he is!💩
The thing is.. Michael Smith plays at MVG's favourite pace. We all know that. So MVG has it bagged up. Half a million baby!
Who let Shrek play darts?
Wtf is wrong with that guy’s throat 😂 it’s all gone after all those years or the Van nelle heavy shag did his thing
Two Micheal's are facing off next for the finals..
Who did MvG beat in the last 16?
How to beat MVG in 2023:  Just win a game on throw in 12 darts and a 9-dart leg on his throw three times in a set for seven sets. Piece of cake
11:35 !!!
Pretty rubbish semis tbh.
MvG's on fire, opponents darts are terrified
Some energy in that place would love to be there.
Fucking silly wayne mardle like, he’s backwards.
Not looking good for Smith.   Dimitri is a better player than clemens and mvg white washed him
Micheal was throwing insane darts… but I still Don’t know how you come back from that if your demitri… that was ugly.
Bullyboy is winning this just too effortless imo
I wouldnt want to be the Treble 20 in the Final
Smith to win but MVG needs to underperform for that to happen don't see it happening if MVG plays like he did tonight the final will be over quickly
Stunning darts from both finalists.  Who can beat MVG?  MICHAEL SMITH... bring it on 👍
Crowd are so used to seeing mvg win that they dont even cheer him anymore
This van  Gerwen is unbeatable. High average and good on doubles? Hopefully he can do the same in the final. Very good final also, both throw quickly. van Gerwen has the top two highest averages of the tournament and since his struggles it would be awesome if he could win a big title like this and hopefully have a great 2023.
mvg is a little slack on doubles here and there, if he misses doubles like that against micheal smith ,smith will win and maybe with ease.
Darts needs to get tid of these clowns commentators 90% of the time they chat utter B.S hard to believe some of them were once professional players some of the throws for check outs etc and other comments are fukn comical 🤣🤣
Wayne mardle course theres positives / u just been humiliated 6-0 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
There is no better crowd in any sport that can hold a candle to dart fans
Clemens run out of steam at 2-2 , Smith was excellent  I want Smith to win but I don't see MVG losing in this form , it will take a monumental drop in form tomorrow , and I don't see it  MVG win I think  Be a good final though
A repeat of the 2019 final I see
how would the 2 Michaels be addressed? "Michael you require 40" I imagine them looking at each other in confusion
Michael will be the champion. I'm sure of that.
Надеюсь, Смит и Ван Гервен после ЧМ поднимутся в рейтинге.
Клеменс очень порадовал на этом турнире. Мощный отрезок выдал.  Ван Ден Берг поддается эмоциям. Видно, как внутри у него бушует буря. Ван Гервен, кстати, тоже не всегда  ровно играет. Но в последнее время, голландец вроде поправил нервишки.
Wowww...from the first round mVg avarage is 100++plus...amazing...😍😍😍
Смит - машина. МВГ - второй сухарь подряд. Такие серии игр и показывают, кто по праву в топе. Приятно, что в финале будут два игрока, за которых болею.  Буду  топить в этот раз за МВГ, конечно.
I would say he's possessed but that's just MVG
Smith is unstoppable this year,great darts
Mvg is a machine. Only one that really looks like he can get to that level is bully.  Such natural beautiful throws. Obviously unbelievably hours of work as well but love the style. Hopefully be one hell of a final
Smith is such a miserable git. Never thought I'd be rooting for a German to beat an Englishman.
#LoveTheDarts
Pretty neutral on MVG overall but will thoroughly enjoy watching him trash Smith in the final
DVDB parece ser uma pessoa com os nervos tão frios, focado.. Quando estava 2x0 em sets para MVG, ele respirava fundo, gesticulava consigo mesmo, olhando para MVG. É o campeonato Mundial e a competição mostrou que precisa ter mais que talento, é nesses momentos que competidores natos como MVG aparecem, vibrando, conduzindo o set.. Não vi DVDB vibrar em nenhum momento, acho que ele estava fadado desde o início. Como fã, fiquei muito desapontado com a postura, da performance nem preciso mencionar. MVG está em outro nível no momento.
M g.
If these two men throw at the levels they did in these matches, this final is going to be insanity.
Most of the top 10 players have "A-games"... Only MVG has "A+++games".
What if MVG white washes Smith, that would be 18 sets in a row. I can't believe i'm even thinking that, but I guess it's possible
MVG 🇳🇱
Dimitri got his pockets picked, his house burgled and his soul snatched away from him. MVG is something else man.
"Oh MVG you're so amazing, no one can ever ever beat you, can I lick your arsehole please?" Shut up batty boy fan boys. Will be a great final whoever wins.
Boring semi-finals, glad I missed them.
After mvg's 170 even Dimi was seen saying 'dat one dere was a violation'
6-0 Smith. Watch this space.  You'll see me on the telly next year as a pundit.
35 dart sets from MVG. Most women's bull offs take 36.
There's only gonna be one winner.
Boring coz mvg will win yet again.
The Master MVG gave the " Dancing 🤡 " a master class 😅
In the final I just hope both players are able to play at their best as that would make for a great final.
There is only one player who deserves this wdc title this year and we all know it.would be straight robbery if mvg would not take this.
Perfect final. The only one who could possibly live with Mvgs scoring atm.  The rhythm will suit both so i could be an absolute belter
Damn van gerwen was not messing around today. 13 straight sets. Only two have gone to 5 legs!
Wtf is wrong with mvg, it's about time the audience did a price on him and boood. Bellowing uncle fester, can't stand his personality.
Vdb is looking he could cry at any moment during the whole match.
Bully,,please relax a few kmh look like you sometime not into the deep,,but next matchhh,,you need to ,,go inside,,and play like you normaly do,,then anything can happend,,congrats so far.
MVG to win the lot imo, not played to his potential but still made it look easy most of the tournament.
Best of 11 sets… 11-minute highlight. That’s when you know MvG just humiliated someone.
MVG looks so dominant hard to not think he could win it!! Sick because I want to see Smith win
Just to show how well MVG is playing, he has the highest average game in this years tournament with 108.28, he also holds spots 2 (107.66) and 4 (102.39). The highest anyone other than MVG got is  Smith with 103.25
The final will be over in a flash, 2 fastest players in the game in the final. Going to be a great game.
1503 points in 35 darts. Not once, but twice. Insane darts.
Michael Smith deserves a world championship in his trophy cabinet after making 3 finals but if mvg throws like tonight hes gonna need to wait another year.
VON FACKEN GERWEN!
Mvg the new champ
🇳🇱
35 darts for a set... Twice 😵‍💫
Lol Dimitri 6-0 ouch ….
Comon smith
Why do all darts players have beer bellys??
Seems like Dimi and Gabriel have left everything in quarters( shame that semis weren’t competitive, but fair play to both Michaels)
Dimitri is a poor player my 12 year old could have challenged him playing like that Michael Smith has two hopes bob and no he be lucky to get two sets in the final
180 shoot out for Final. Smith brilliant in SF...congrats to Clemens. Van Gerwan blew Dimitri away who seemed a bit overawed.
Proper wank is darts, sorry.could not resist
Those darts from MVG were insane no one can keep up with him when he’s playing that well.
Mvg🐎🐎
Dimitri take the mic and tell them your shit  hahahaha  MVG is on rageeee
Flawless
Clements had a awesome tournament with great darts 👍 Big respect for him.
Watch mvg he's always in the red zone
MvG plays a different sport at the moment. 35 darts for a set is insane. Hope bully boy comes on with a performance like tonight! Might be a great final.
Chris dobey got an EGG followed by dimi. 😁
Gabriel doesn't have Germanic facial features. Is his dad Belgian ?
"Smacks of desperation really", John Part is hilarious
MVG had a set, maybe 3rd or 4th, at 128 Average. 128!
Poor Dimitri played a 97+ average and got treated like a Brazilian football team playing Germany in BRA71L !
Van Gerwen is so insane, it felt like he wasn't even playing that incredible and in the meanwhile he was averaging 105. What an animal, at his peak nobody in history can compete with him.
Excited to see Clemens make it this far. More excited to see Smith and MVG in the finals. It’s going to be a great match!
Come on Smithy! What a game......180's all over.
In a league of his own
MVG vs Smith op
Looking forward to the battle of the Michael's
The cheating needs to be called out and punished
Smith top
My question is how did van de berghe get to the semis ? He was no match for mvg quite literally chalk and cheese
I don't care
MVG just embarrassing the competition
Smith 7-5 in a thriller. Calling it now will be back tomorrow…. Lets go Michaels!
Anyone but MVG. Is there anyone less likeable in all of sport?
Literally scary darts from MVG, Dimi had no chance sadly, going to be a class final v Michael Smith hopefully with the best 2 players in the tournament. Clemens & Bully Boy delivering on the 180 count, I'd imagine Michael will need about 20-25 maybe even 30 to keep up.
Come on the bully boy can't be bothered with another mvg title
These semi-finals were a massacre
MVG demolition of DVB was AOK
Another Final between Bully Boy and MVG!!!  Come on Michael Smith!! You can do it!!
It will be a great final can't wait for it
Michael, Michael… do me a favour and hit at least 36 180s between you. Tournament number will reach 900 if you do. Much obliged 😁
Michael vs Michael 2.
Announcer for Smith and Clemens really dragging out his 180s. So annoying.
Michael > Michael
And here we are - as many predicted, the final will be between two Michaels. Although tournament statistics are better for MVG, if Michael Smith will score like today and hit the doubles like against Steven Bunting, the final should be very interesting. As a fan of Bully Boy, I will keep my fingers crossed for him. If he will lose, then there will be no shame, because at the moment MVG is showing a real class. It's simple as that - who's gonna be better tomorrow, will lift the trophy 🏆
Van Gerwin surely got to win he’s a machine
Dimitri is a knob.
MVG for his fourth World Championship win. He is on   🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What a tournament! I think mvg is winning this!
MVG,  13 sets in a row and counting.
25:22, nice try 🤔
Dimi is a strange bloke ain’t he
Probally the most telegraphed final in a long time. Smith v van Gerwen, i would think most people had this final set at the start.
What a tournament it’s been so far. Enjoyed from start to finish. May the best man win 🏆
MVG vs The Bully! I'll be happy with either winning. I'll be shocked if MVG loses as he's by far played the best throughout the tournament.
The most handsome darter will win.
Micheal Van Gerwen's darts are crazy. It's bizarre how he's throwing these tripples like a freakin' machine!
Smith has played well this tournament however mvg Is just on another level he clean sweeps a semi against a good player in dimi so heartbreak in the final again for smith
Two white wash in a row, on the road to the final, he lost only 3 sets. That's what can i say, MvG is definitely a favourite for the final.
Cant wait for this its gonna be amazing, the scoring will be brilliant its about whoever finishes better. MVG is playing at a slightly higher level and has been there and done it before so he would come in as favourite but if they both turn up like today it could be an intriguing contest. Its gonna be fast and its gonna be fantastic so i cant wait.
This MvG is prime MvG again and maybe even better. He was off for years but this MvG would have won 6 or 7 titles already.  This level is just disgusting...
I mean MVG has won 2 games without conceding a set. Ridiculous ability
Bully Boy the Bottler. Hope he wins however!
it's gonna be an insane final if they play like tonight..
Michael "The Dream Crusher" van Gerwen.
MVG Vs Smith is going to Be a Ally Pally Classic Both Averaged over 102 and Both Won Comprehensively MVG won 6-0 with a 108.28 Average and Smith Won 6-2 with a 103.12 Average This Final is Going To Go Mad With 180s and High Checkouts
Get this most liked fuck it
Should be a great Final🏆Looking foward to it🎯👍
Michael Smith will bottle it and MVG gets his 4th World Title.
MVG is in such good form and is in my opinion the best darts player ever. Will smith bottle another worlds final? I think so 👍🏼👍🏼
if u aint first ur last
It’s going to be one tasty final. Up the Bully Boy!!
I think Michael is going to win
What happend to Dimitri i wanna know
Top stuff from MvG
