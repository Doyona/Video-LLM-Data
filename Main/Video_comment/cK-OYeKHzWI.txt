What was your favorite highlight from this game?
And then Panama 🇵🇦 beat them the following game on a penalty shoot out 😁
Commentator: "Who cares who it came off of!"
TQL Stadium - Cincinnati, Ohio (Result 2-2) (Penalties 3-2)
Matt Turner for Secretary of Defense
BRO I FELT LIKE I WAS POSSESSED BY GOING FOR USA CAUSE I GO FOR MEXICO
I have to get my nails and nails out and then my mom will come pick them and I’m not going anywhere until like four forty four so I’m going home now and I’m just leaving my sisters and I’m just getting off
Heard I have twenty two brothers
We were there
Oh look, another thing the USA is better at than Canada.
How can a team win when half the players hate the country they play for? Crystal Dunn, Naomi Girma and Emily Fox, plus midfielder Andi Sullivan and forwards Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman, all appeared not to be joining in singing the National Anthem. Rapinoe seemed happy she missed her penalty shot.
How sad b/c of this 🇺🇲 vs 🇨🇦 playoff match should have been this 2023 Gold Cup finals.
I am not a cig but I person is not a person and you can tell that
I keep telling everybody,  the USA DOESN'T HAVE STAR PLAYERS!! THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF PREPPY PRIVILEGED SOFT BOYS!!!! the don't search and recruit players! They stick to their high priced  expensive Soccer Academies were all the kids playing have parents that pay for them to play!!!! It pay to play,  that's why they SUCK in talent level and star quality players!!!! They totally overlook the really serious players with the passion and beast mode in them!!! I Coach at lowest and highest levels!! So i see where it has gone wrong for USA soccer!!!!!!😖
We love Matt Turner such a great keeper for us man 🔥🔥
😂😂😂😂😂
“All he has to do is guide it home” 2:18  Yeah you know how hard those can be to place on frame 🤣
ITS CALLED SOCCER  USA  USA  USA USA
Canada has the Queen on their money.  Hence they take penalties like the English.
Yes 😂😅
Canada should have honestly won this. St. Clair played so much better than Turner
shame on you . highlights starts 49 minutes . what. stupid editing game .
USA  USA USA
Both goalies from both sides were mvp of the match
Electric. Wish Mexico games could be this much fun again.
I stopped watching at 80th minute cause i had a game and came back to penalties🤣
Boring game
Wow another Hispanic carrying usa
The second USMNT goal was beautiful,messy,funny, and I'm glad it happened!!
Were there actually no highlights in the first 49 minutes or is this yet another reason that whoever puts Fox's highlights together should be fired
2023 and you still can't upload your highlights in 1080p you're a joke
The USA should be sued BY OTHER NATIONS for calling the NFL football    🏈 WHEN WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE CALL SOCCER IS FOOTBALL ⚽️
Good job boys
The USA didn't deserve to win. But so Many times they are so lucky like on this game, the canadian autogoal ?! also the referees always help the USA?! there' was a penalty in the first half, they didn't call it!!
USA! USA! USA!
What a good game
I do wish there was a way to not award PKs on such incidental handballs.
1:45 what a ball
My Favorite highlight that was not shown was Cowell fighting off 3 defenders to get into the box. That was spectacular and should’ve been covered cause that guy was a tank in that moment.
Many thanks for not ruining the game by putting the score in the title.
Where is superstar PULSIC 🇺🇸💪
ty team USA
Not a big soccer fan, but it'll be nice to see the US become dominant in World Cups eventually
Well... I would say we have a legit rivalry here.
Busio's the kid in drops that only knows the b button. Absolutely lazy in the mid, no runs, no creativity. Just see ball shoot ball. We were so mid in the mid
Hey, I’ve seen this before!
America is CANTada's daddy. We own you in soccer.
Canada pulled a leafs
Thank god for Matt Turner. Saved us from being eliminated lol
WOW!!!
US and Canada "soccer"...yawn.
6:22 literally any European could’ve scored that… stick to ice hokey
All I see are 2 countries who’ll never win a World Cup
Well deserved win, Canada was lucky to get to extra time tbh. USA!
horrible low quality game
Again the goalie is doing his job
USA immigrant recruitment agency certainly works well with the national team lol..Dudes playing they hearts out for a citizenship/visa
The US men's team is finally more fun to watch then the women's team. And more patriotic too.
Own goal Karma for a rediculous handball call. Then the Keeper comes through BIG TIME for the win.
Can someone explain, Is the gold cup even our main team minus the goalie? It seems like these our the reserves, and if so is it like that for the other countries as well?
Great game. John Strong is a incredible broadcaster. He really captures the mood. Stu Holden as well.
I am glad there are highlights as soccer is snooze fest mostly.
If Cade Cowell starts, we probably win in regulation. But I'm glad the boys fought hard and thank god for Turner
That’s a win straight outta the movie. I’m starting to like soccer lol
Canadian GK was amazing in this game. Shame that tying score deflected off his teammate. Great intense Game.
Crazy game. Not the best from the US team but somehow found a way to win it.  Matt Turner was amazing on the penalty kicks.  😘
They skipped over the part with the referee
Wait, where’s Pulisic and other star players?
Jolly good show
The Gold Cup is a joke! They need to combine North and South America and have a real tournament with different host countries, plus a PK shootout is total rubbish, that is why hockey is so much better to watch.
Jamaica Will beat USA team
Have no respect for Canadian team. They need to be trained
Canadian team are weak
What a thriller!
Matt Turner read them like a BOOK! first penalty was taken by the guy who made Canada's in-game penalty. he went straight down the middle. Matt is a GENIUS! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Just remember the USA didn’t bring there best team
KINGS OF CONCACAF! canada is absolutely overrated. a few skilled players, a world class side does not make. the US had 3rd & 4th stringers out there and handled (boringly) this team. zach mcgraw, i understand why you joined but just know we feel sorry & laughing. you can make it in this US side, seriously. It just seems like the easy road. much respect to you for real. love you little brothers to the north! the more you improve the more we both improve. always rooting for you. what a lovely rivalry.
Crazy this is USA C or D team. Cause even the 6-7 players on this squad that went to the World Cup didn’t really play and their spots are on the line with Ricardo pepi Folarian Paxton Josh wynder Jonathan Gomez coming so the players on this squad better show out cause their spots on the line for 2026 World Cup
I love how Matt turner learned from the in game penalty that Canada was gonna kick the ball in the middle again during the penalty shootout and he guessed right. That first penalty shootout kick went to the middle and Matt turner stayed put and blocked it. That messed up the kickers for Canada cause then Matt turner was ready to keep blocking
That boy Matt turner
Canada ranked 45, USA ranked 11.... just sayin..
Not even trying to be dramatic; this was the worst game of "professional" soccer that I have ever seen
Turner is somehow just a beast when he needs to be.   Tim Howard will always be Superman but I’m ready to hand Turner a superhero pseudonym
My guy from Arsenal ❤, Come on you gunners
Good to see our boys compete! Well done.
Get in! 🇺🇸 🌎
Harry MaGuire #23 for Canada
USA is terrible, they really expect to get to semis of World Cup with this kind of play lmao, not even getting through round of 16.
We need our A and B team back😂
Matt Turner is the next Howard. He does so good i hope he keeps growing and learning
Where was pulisic?!
canada won that game too much extra time
So many bad penalty takes, but my god that Busio penalty was world class
Hooray we beat Canada😂
Congratulations team USA 🎉🎉🎉
The new el Classico
Jesus Christ, who is in charge of the highlights, what good is it to waste time showing a possible penalty/VAR issue if you are not going to show what happened to get to it? why waste time showing the referee doing absolutely nothing? is the game this bad that you need content to make it the allowed time?
That was a tight match
This USA team is better🎉
That second Canada goal was crazy, u could tell he wanted it
Huge respect to both teams, this was a exciting match. Matt Turner and that Canadian goalie did insane in this match.
Watching the manager of Canada smiling and thinking it was over and done....except it wasn't
Rubbish Penalty for Canada
Tough loss eyyy?
The 2 goal keepers play their heart out
Both goalies showed out!
Lmaooo the way they cheated for the USA WAS CRAZYYYYY 😂😂😂…#GoodGameStill
Matt Turner the GOAT
This game gave me "WC 2022 Final " vibes with the comebacks and the penalties were quite exciting too.
as a prior fan of USA soccer.. wow this team looks terrible. good thing Canada is worse.
US: Plays it's D team Canada: Everyone we can muster Matt Turner: Don't worry I got it
USA🎉 I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WIN!!!!!😮
John Stone ruins the fan experience
Only thing better than US goal was Canadian goal ;}
It’s great to see the concacaf getting better. Great game both teams.
It's funny that the first highlight is at 48 minutes
I’m going to be honest, America football fans have been annoying me recently so I wanted Canada to win lol. But props to Matt Turner, he was amazing
United States and Canada put on a World Cup Performance 🔥🔥
The ref has to run off the field to a tv? Why is their not a TMO?
That review call was BS, I’m glad the U.S. pulled it out
1000TH COMMENT
HATS OFF TO CANADA, They were the better Team!!! From Boston down with The democrats in America and the communist Trudeau in Canada!!!
https://youtu.be/Ec7J2NYmqVs
I like how they show kickoff then the next “highlight” is in the 49th minute. Just goes to show the world class talent on the pitch 😂
Unfair game ever.
I SWEAR USA COMMENTATORS ARE THE WORST 😂
This should’ve been the final. Now the final is going to be a red card fest and fifty American players getting hurt.
New coach
Good way to shut up these obnoxiously pretentious Canadians
all the hype about canada going into the world cup.... and they were terrible
As a famous basketball coach said: "There is victory and there is misery".
Why is USA playing with their bench?
Good game..usually soccer is kinda boring but that was exciting.
Matt Turner should leave Arsenal, as he is too good of a goalkeeper to sit on the bench. Even if it is to an unglamorous team in the Premier League it will benefit him immensely to get regular action on a week to week basis.
Both teams played really well especially both of the goalkeepers. Great and Intense Game!
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Congratulations USA
Penalties are trash way to win. Thats boring. But atleast they bothe scored twice
Usa got real lucky always scoring goals in the last minutes . Turner is a good goalie he has my respects and I don’t support usa
didnt know christoph waltz was canada's coach.
80 min of boredom followed up my an intense ending and 2 half times plus a nerve wracking penalty shootout. What a game
game was so boring they just skip to the second half for highlights
ufffff canada had it in the bag but it is what it is great game go usa
How was there nothing from the first half? The highlights here compared to NBC sports just look weird from an editing perspective
USA has to do MUCH better if they want to stand against Panama, they got lucky that Canada also didn’t use their best team
MATT TURNER MVP
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This is really USA C team vs Canada B team, but boy what an epic match
everything should go to extra time and then pk's its just so much better
USA USA USA
Game was mad intense and ironic it was between Usa and Canada
Maguire carried America 😊🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
What an amazing game!! Not great soccer, but great game and glad we're moving on!!! My boy Turner representing the name!
What a game 👏🏼👌🏼
We have a new Classico!
Lost my voice at this game
LETS GOOO USA… SEMI’S HERE WE COME! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
To answer my highlights question from this match: Our first goal, great cross and great header. Our goalie blocking 2 PK shots....won us this match. Our 3rd PK shot by our #6 right into the top corner of the goal ......... simply unblock-able.
COYG! ⚪️🔴
Man, good thing the highlights included the ref making a square with his finger and running around the field instead of the handball/foul that actually happened.
Is Canada allergic to wearing red?
I see USA vs Jamaica in the Gold Cup finals 💙❤️🤍🇺🇸
I am soooo excited about the USMNT! The future is just so bright and getting brighter every year as the talent pool grows in quantity and quality!
“WHO CARES WHO IT CAME OFF LAST. TIED GAME”  😂😂😂
I swear, goal keepers are some of the most insane athletes in all of sports
To Canadian fans, you guys have some great young talent and between the US and Canada, Mexico has lost its seat being the best in North America. Good job Canada keep doing what you guys are doing because its working!!
Wow
those first two pk stops by turner was LEGIT. This team's PK team was so bad except for Busio.
USA fans show respect to their opponents. When Canada went on top 2-1 I didn’t see anything thrown at players.
Mexico fan here , good work USA playing some good matches lately
USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸!!!!!!!
Great game. Team USA
What a game!!
Bro the only A team player (Turner) will carry them to the finals lol
Was so frustrating to see our guys not finish their chances last night... So many shots directly to their keeper. Have got to learn to have more poise in front of goal. Place the ball away from the keep...
Was at the game it was something to watch, especially be 30 feet away for the goal they took the PK's on. The atmosphere was awesome. Guatemala fans showed up and showed out for the first game, they were going nuts. Had a great time with the people around me. Then when the US was getting ready to start, lots changed in to their US jerseys and cheered just as loud for the US as the did for Guatemala. That's what soccer is all about. Great time had by just about all.
Wow,the US keeper won the  game!
Dayne went crazyyy
I loved watching this game. stayed up just to watch the game and it was worth it.
Where are they finding these referees. They are awful.
Felicidades USA
Tim Howard is proud of Matt Turner
Where's ferreria ? Seems he only scores against small teams🤡 trash
Great games by the goalies, unfortunate bounce for Canada on the second goal. Wouldn’t be surprised if they send out Miles Robinson in handcuffs next game to make sure he keeps his hands down
USA still managed to win without there starters you can tell it takes a toll tho
And turner’s confidence continues to grow….
The U.S. is so trash  hahaha
John Strong is still a terrible commentator...
The keepers were the MVPs for both teams
That own goal will haunt Canada
Garbage penalty kick lol
The U.S.A should have scored more. There were a lot of off balance shots. Either attempt a real shot or pass the ball. The training of defenders in the U.S.A is also bad. Players are taught to retreat endlessly without doing anything to pressure or re-direct the attacker.  On the plus side we have goalie and box to box midfield play.
Not much of a soccer fan but trying to watch/learn more. My question is how good is the American team. How will they match up in World Cup?  Have seen them win some games and look good but am pretty much ignorant when it comes to soccer.
It was an ugly match. A couple glimpses of quality soccer. Otherwise, it was a weak showing. Tuner came up big! Cowell is looking real good. Not enough movement in the midfield.   Alexi Lalas was dead nuts accurate with his comments at the half!
With the usa  b/c team we doing pretty good if you ask me    They are getting it together
I hate the inadvertent hand balls in the box giving a PK, there is no way that impeded a goal, many do not.
This game was probably the best we'll see in this Gold Cup
Vazques and US phenomenal ^_^ Canada disappoints vs US, again!%
Ridiculous game. This was our B team. One will hope we will have the real A team for the Copa America. What is the point of these tournaments if we aren't using our real team? And who are we sending to the Olympics?  Some of our best players are under 23 but will they go? Probably not.
The US have a great keeper in Turner
The Narrow and Wide Gates 13 “Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.(Matthew 7:13-14)
why is every US team completely different?
Love how it skips the entire first half
The United States consistently produces some of the absolute best goalkeepers in the world. Bravo Matt Turner!
So whats the point of us team beating one of its own state team?😅😅
Great match. The USA found a way to win in a thriller. Both goalies made some huge saves. USA had the game and then lost it. Canada had the game and then lost it. USA finally won it.
What a game !!!
Another reminder.  Giving out free goals for inadvertent handballs, is quite possibly the dumbest rule in any sport.
Great match, Canada is good so definitely a good confidence boost for the US
matt turner tha 🐐
Glad to have been at this one.  The crowd kept chanting, "We want Vazquez!" The hometown hero delivered again
USA! USA!
Holy Molly that was INSANE !
Idk why they’re hyped with tieing and beating Canada in penalties. the hunger and ambition is not there for the US
I am so happy they won now because I get to go the game against Panama 🇵🇦
Canada was hungry
all these american world class players....struggle to beat canada lol
WOW JUST WOW LOVE THIS TEAM 🇺🇸
those penalties were horrendous
Did Canada have their first team?
What an absolutely insane game. A masterclass from both keepers. I was sweating bullets the whole time.
♥️🇺🇲
Great match
Vasquez should definitely fit in the bench of the main team, he can be a great substitute or even a starter one day
Wait let me get this straight, NOTHING INTERESTING HAPPENED FOR THE FIRST 50 MINUTES?!?
Cade and Busio are money
First "highlight" is 48-minutes in lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Dam I feel bad for Canada they have the worst luck
Why is the us playing their MLS second team
was the first half that bad that there's no highlights from it??
USA!🇺🇸USA!🇺🇸USA!🇺🇸
I watched the game yesterday when USA scored I was sprinting around the house screaming and then two minutes later this dude gets a handball and get the scored on with a penalty and that’s when I started😢😢😢 it was a great match
Those first half highlights thoooo 🥵
I’m 34 seconds in to this video and they’re showing me the second half…. Welp. Soccer will never conjure enough steam to enter the main stream
Canada is so WEAK can't believe it went to penalties. The US needs a lot before they can compete abroad.
matt turner was a dawg in this game
use got so lucky
lets goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!
MAT TURNER CRAZY GAME GREAT SAVES LETS GO USAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!
What a game! 🇺🇸… Bye bye Canada eh! 😂
Man. USA brought almost 0 star players.
If a tree falls in the woods does it make a sound?
4:30 golaço
Matt Turner learned from the first time and anticipated Vittoria shooting straight for the center. Amazing talent!
Reynolds casually walking back in the second goal 😂😂😂
Game Turner
Compare this atmosphere to the NFL or baseball games….
Go my elegant selection USA.
You know it was a good game when there was only 1 highlight in the first half and most of the highlights are from the PK shoot out….
First off lfg 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸! Second Canada has a great fkn goalie! And a bit of bad lucm left them out. Canada keeps improving.
USAs second goal gave me flashbacks to Messi’s second goal in the World Cup finals. The commentator had a similar reaction as well, what a beautiful day that was
Best match I've seen so far, that second Canadian goal is classic.
Mexico is waiting the finalist
For those saying the pk wasn’t lucky, the Canadian player completely whiffed a trap at the exact moment Robinson reached out for the player.  The ball then managed to bounce directly to Robinson’s hand.  It was a correct call, but Canada’s best play in 90 minutes was a missed trap.
Why doesn't the US keep this coach? I think he's doing a good job.
Congrats USA!!! Hey Canada, great game, ya'll showed up took it to them!
Being at the game was probably one of the coolest sporting matches ever, the atmosphere was so cool with such a high level game, with such a thrilling ending!! USA USA USA
USA weak they’re going to lose next game
Didn't see the game but based on the highlights the fans got  their moneys worth. But the penalties at the end were horrible. Not one player stepped up and struck that ball with intent, pure nerves and caution which is why a keeper can save a few.
Clutch
insanity
Would've been nice to watch the game, but I'm not paying for cable tv just to sometimes watch something that is on Fox.
Canadas second goal was clean !
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Here’s a quarter, call someone who cares.
Matt turner is the goat
Let's go step it up guys 🇺🇸💪💯
I started watching this game at the 82 min😂 thank god
The new USA vs Mexico. The new CONCACAF el Classico
Man Canada so unlucky
Someone gotta cut Robinson's arms off. Second time last night he had his wing sticking out like that.
Canada vs USA gets spicier and spicier each time they play…. And after this game it will be even more intense next time. Canada wont forget
Free throw shooting contests to decide championships.  Football.  🤣🤣🤣
PKs are the lamest way to win a game ever
why were the us struggling so much this does not give me faith for the future
Ref was from Washington DC
Jones assist was immaculate, Vazquez did well to put it away
Hand ball law needs to be revised. Should be no penalty for completely accidental hand ball, that should be an indirect free kick. Penalty for that is way beyond the foul.
Matt Turner pulling off his own version of Tim Howard. Great saves throughout the match even better saves for the penalties.
USA🎉
Two evenly matched B teams.  It would have been interesting to have seen an A team matchup.  Unfortunately for the USMNT the next time these two squads will match up at full power Berhalter will be back on the pitch coaching and thus Canada automatically will have the advantage.  Matt Turner is a a player.  He deserves serious playing time regardless of the league.
FS1, your highlight packaging sucks. You show the review of the first penalty but don’t show the incident in question and then don’t show the resulting penalty kick? The transitions are jarring and choppy, no multi angle replays.   You guys need to step up your game and make it look a bit more like NBC Sports highlights.
So amazing
Too easy for US.
Golden GEN of USA here we go!
5:43 anyone thinking of England vs france
USA, USA, USA!
Good god, I thought we were not going to make it so huge kudos to the team for achieving the impossible but....but, many of them played their best game and almost cost the qualification: Ferreira, many times shied away from pressuring Canada's defense and he was the reason why Shaffelburg was able to move freely and score Canada's second goal, DeJuan Jones was imprecise, his only good play was the assistance for Vasquez's header, Zendejas and Gressel didn't do that much either. on the other hand both Vasquez and Cowell were instrumental in improving the attack, both are the typical target men and this is what we need, thumbs up for Long, Morris and Miazga, hyge thumbs up for Turner, he saved our bacon.
AND THE CROWD GOES NEUTRAL
Why didn’t we se a replay of the first VAR penalty decision 🤨
DAYUMM what a great match. USA! USA! USA!
Good match but two questions remain....1) Why can't Robinson keep his hands down in the box?!?(lol) and SERIOUSLY Why is Zendejas starting??????, with all due respect to him , he has done nothing in this tournament.
Just goes to show that “Berhalter ball” is mostly due to the players available. Not a single midfielder was able to break lines up the middle. As usual it was try to flank the wings and get crosses in. We were lucky to win this game.
Amazing game. Not 1000 women soccer games can ever be as intense as this one game 😅
Man they stole this game from Canada.
Canada played this game like they play hockey, hard and tough. 5 total shots and 4 cards!  USA played with skill and control. 21 total shots and 2 cards! Fantastic game of football.
I bet money on this game and lost even though I chose USA moneyline 🫤
Like always a last min goal 😂😂😂
What do ya know? Fox has the worst coverage AND the worst highlights
I’m not a fan of team USA but their first goal was nice Nice header
USA USA USA🎉!!!!!!
This could have been a classic game where the USMNT blew a game and lost. Happy to see that they were able to pull through with a win but they need to perform better if they ever want to be competitive in other major competitions
Arsenal needs start putting turner in goal for pk’s 😭
The worst US lineup but congratulations
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Great game from both sides proud of USA soccer
The US finishing was horrible, these bums needed a lucky own goal to make the ball go in. I'll take it, but they had low composure in front of net tonight.
I don’t know how the us didn’t lose this but hey, a win is a win am I right???
Matt frickin turner! Wow
I love how this rivalry is shaping up! US was lucky to escape with the win, thank you Matt Turner, the next in our long line of world class keepers!
Jesus...what a relief.  Team USA is going all the way!
Bro us got lucky he has to thank that defenda
Saint Clair is so good
That game was bananas. I really love the current USMNT. You gotta win tough games like this to be successful.
Bj Callaghan undefeated lol 😂
The luckiest US win ever lmaoooo
All time classic
Nice try hat.
Let's go USA
Glad us won but dammm that goal from shalfferbrug was insane bring that engery back to Nashville sir!
LFG
Usa 🇺🇸 ❤
This was a rough game to eatch
congrats to USMNT!  great moxie!
Never have I seen a keeper stand in the middle knowing the taker is gonna go down the middle again wow amazing Matt turner
Game was a USA tutorial on backwards passing.
I was watching the game and saint clair was WORKING
Great game!!
Canada beat themselves with that own goal
They suck.
USA
That was way too close
6:26-no no no ref, the crossbar is worth a point what are you talking about??? Lol 🤷🏻‍♂️
insane
One of the most fun matches I've ever seen. Great plays on both sides tonight.
Lol, I don’t watch soccer all that much anymore, but how in Gods name do you get an additional 10 minutes stoppage time? Wow… must be really corrupt now lmao, more than usual I mean 🤷🏻‍♂️☕️
That was awesome 🎉 USA ❤
That is no pk in stoppage time. Terrible officials as usual but in the end still got the result.
You know this game was bad when, other than a handball check, there are 0 highlights in the first 65 minutes lmao
20 minutes of extra time needs to stop.
😂😂😂 they can VAR this but couldn’t VAR for HAITI.
I love Turner.
Matt Turner you BEAST
Great call from Lalas: "WHO CARES WHO IT WENT IN OFF OF?"
VAR is ruining the run of play and ticky tack calls - Nobody on either side would agree that the stoppage time handball was a PK - terrible decision
Zero highlights from the first 45 - I thought it must have been a terrible game. I was so wrong. Whoever decided this was a second-rate tournament forgot to tell the players. They were celebrating each penalty like it had just won the World Cup. Absolute scenes.
Good morning to Matt Turner and Gianluca Busio only.
There's  no looser from that game they both deserve  to win great game
Great, Foreigners vs Foreigners.
Matt Turner shootout 🐐
on to the next
Was there really no highlights before the 48th minute? And can we like... idk... show a replay of the VR decision? Call me crazy but I'd actually like to see the highlights of the whole game
This was a surprisingly good match.
jesus this felt like the final
That much trouble to get past lowly Canada.  My God the US is awful at football
Best part of that game is the SUPER CHILL second-goal celebration by the Canadian striker. LOL
Wow. What a game!
W
Incredible match ……………⚽️ 🥅
Americans have been disrespectful to soccer ⚽ for a long time since the beginning of the world. But... soccer is  the world wide number 1 sport. American football is the number Last sport. They thought they knew better..but the world knew the most.
What a game
USA USA USA 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
Shaffleberg is a baller from Canada interesting to see where his career goes
Please Americans, say it 'FOOTBALL', when you say it s****r,it is feels same as punching us in the gut for fellow lovers of the game around the world except in America.
Talking about scraping by! I would rather lose to any other countries besides Canada and Mexico, truly 😂 If we beat them, it's a good result! Excellent job by the U.S. keeper!!!
🚀
why can't I get 1080p? this is fox network man
jesus.. that shootout was a hard watch 😅
Yes yes yes yes ❤
That penalty was so stupid bc the only reason the ball went up that high was bc of a terrible touch. He couldn’t bring it down fast enough
People see exciting game. I just see struggling to beat Canada… 🤦‍♂️
Panama will have a field day with this USA line up
Great job goal keeper 🎉
Great win by the boys
No lie it was a pretty dull game until the last 10 minutes or so of regulation and extra time but what matters is it ended really good
Where was the handball located at???? Was it in the goal box???
Thank God!!! Now our, the US B team moves on. Now vs. a Panama team that has all it's A players. In the final Mexico to has mostly it's A team. Hopefully Pulisic and company can play in Copa America.
Canada was dumb for not putting up a wall after their 2nd goal. Totally dumb. They played it like some stupid MLS game, wide open, moving the ball around and not leaving defenders at the back. That is criminal and completely amateurish. Typical of a stupid Concacaf game, when will they learn. This is why none of these teams do well at the World Cup
Www good job teem USA to be champions 2023 good luck
ITS TURNER TIME!!
America CHeated!@
Canada pack 😂😂😂 🚬🚬🚬
USA lucky dog, but win is win... hahah Congrats USA!
One sad stat...there were 24k fans for the US playing on home soil. There were 60k for Mexico vs Costa Rica in the US. Embarrassing.....
This was one of the craziest Gold Cup Finals Ever! 🤪
Collison Course vs Mexico
What an exciting game... Of the best...
Great game! No doubt the U.S got really, really lucky to come away with the W!! The game vs Panamá 🇵🇦 is gonna be another cardiac arrest type of game!!! 🥵
USA needs to play better next game....
Trump 2024
Somehow the USMNT came back to win this game in penalty kicks. Im not real confident in this roster for the semifinals and/or finals if they make it.
Incredible game... that Canadian goalie deserved the win man.. that last goal was heartbreaking.
Jesus Christ this team sucks, If it weren't for Matt we would've lost in the quarter final! We're not going far with this call up
Don't forget Matt Turner dropped that great ball into the box that led to the tying goal (man of match). Vazquez's crosses were worse than his pk. Cowell was exciting to watch. Jones may have been the most solid overall. Ferreira has shown he isn't effective (a bit lucky on his ok too). Reynolds is way too static and needs to stop standing on the ball. If only Busio could capitalize on his efforts...that's all
What a great game
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
US MNT W🤣N again 😍🙌….
You know a game had little offensive competence when the first highlight of the video immediately skips to the 48th minute.
matt turner is such an amazing keeper
Gressel, Sands, Neil, Zendejas and Jones shouldn't even be on the roster, definitely not starting quality. This game was awful to watch but glad we went through.
Wow what a stressful game, wasn't expecting the comeback
USA 🇺🇸 ⚽️ 🗑️ 🚮 💩
the US mens are gonna make major noise in the upcoming world cup.... i love our chances!!
Canada sucks!
Ugly game. US better get their sh*t together for the Panama game.
How is the first highlight from the 48th minute? Come on we need more of the game than this
The U.S got lucky af
That last US goal to tie was luckier than my birth
USA! USA! USA! 🇺🇸🦅
Ferrera was pathetic on Schakelberg prior to his goal.
It's not always going to be easy. Teams are always going to bring their best. Games like this can define our team for the rest of the tourney.
Man you can tell both teams took their B or C team based on the PKs. You can see both teams have no experience taking PKs. The first two from both teams were awful. I think only 1 canadian and 1 US pk were actually good ones, the rest were bad. Surprised turner didn't stop another one, and ferreira is lucky the keeper didn't keep his hand firm or the keeper would've saved that one too.
sort of similar to winning gold at the special olympics
The atmosphere here was absolutely electric
Great game, and proud of the US. But Fox Sports these highlights have consistently been terrible. How can you show that a VAR review happened, but not show the actual event under question? 0:47 in particular.
Our A team and B team is better than theirs.
WOW!
Wish I was there, such a classic.
They better suspend and fine the Canada players trying to assault US guys headed to the locker room. Absolutely classless Laryea throwing a fit after diving so much during game.
Canadian Goal Keeper was insane today.
Can't see the USA beating Mexico on this form. Hopefully, they will make the final.
1 highlight from the first half? Smh fox
The USMT had me at the edge of my seat with how bad they played. That the Lord for Matt Turner tho 😭
Soccer is the dumbest game ever
Fantastic game start to finish. Both squads played their hearts out tonight!
Lots of dumb comments saying the US was extremely lucky. That's overstatement. Both teams had their share of luck good and bad. Look at the stats. USA dominated. Neither squad had their best roster on the field, but it's reasonable to say the better team won, even if that isn't always the case. (Re: Mexico vs. Qatar).
The Goalkeepers were the MVPs! Props to them both.
Back to wack usa. Thanks a lot berhalter.
Turner what a legend!
Canada( Americas hat) is allergic to trophies 🤧
Quick question just wondering y aren’t the normal USMNT starters starting
Why didn't yall show the first var check? Y'all showed the second var check, but not the first? Was it that egregious?
Ima Arsenal fan and I really want Matt turner to get his chance to start in the premier league. HE’S HIM 💯💯
Btw...this should have been a blowout victory for the USA...at least 4 or 5-1 (their penalty was extremely soft because the defender's arm was in a natural position as he was bracing to make contact with another player), but Canada's GK had the game of his life. Wouldn't be surprised if he gets signed up by a decent/good European team.
Great job to Canada trying they best to almost have it let's go USA soon revenge the Mexico 🇲🇽 once again 🇺🇸🤝🇨🇦
USA really wanted to give this game away 🤷🏽‍♂️
What a freakin game!!!
Repent before it too late 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
and ferreira disappears against a decent team. that media love fest was so stupid. he has no business playing against anybody but banana republics.
It is very telling that the first highlight of the game was from deep in stoppage time of the first half and it was a VAR review. Horrible first half. I think this was Canada's strategy because they knew they couldn't win a game against the USA, even with our C+/B team out there, without making the game very ugly with a lot of stop/starts and fouls. Glad we pulled it out in the end, but USA needs to do better.
That penalty shootout was kinda cringe honestly. Props to Matt Turner for not getting baited to save the first one, but after that i guess the nerves set in cause almost every PK taken was bad, and several missed the net outright. PKs favor the kicker immensely, and should never be off target, thats the bare minimum for a professional level, if its not in a corner so be it, but make the keeper guess right and make the save. Both sides were guilty of this
is Gold Cup more prestigious than Nations League?
720p max???
MATT TURNER IS THAT GUY! TRUST ME PAL, HE’S THAT GUY
Canada top team lost to usa second team. We own canada
USA USA USA
USA USA USA
USA USA USA
What a great match for the USMNT and the Canadian squad.

fox always has the worst highlight vids
Turner is THAT GUY. I really like Busio, and Cowell
USA fan - Congrats to Canada - good game.
Matt turner ❤️❤️❤️ Jesus Ferreira as usual disappeared
Editing is so bad
U play  south  and get ready to get punched and kicked to death but if u play North class and respectful player enjoy the game...  Animals Mexicans 😅
USA 🇺🇸
MERICA 🇺🇸
GG
Believe
Mexico vs USA final.
That's what you get for playing chicken with Matt Turner! A primal yell to the face!!! Mess around and find out taking the exact same penalty twice in the game.
Awesome
Very tough game against Canada, but team USA could obtain the victory, now they will face Panamá not an easy contest.
did nothing happen in the first half of the game? the highlights start at 49’
A Christmas miracle in July 🇺🇸
Huge respect to both teams, this was a exciting match. Matt Turner and that Canadian goalie did insane in this match.
Les sudo .....Canada a cresido mucho ...sin duda una final adelantada ...no creo que Mexico este al nivel de estas dos selecciones pero ya veremos ....
Absolute insane match, a rollercoaster of emotions!
Shout out our keeper Matt!
We got so lucky bruh
Where’s balogun and pulisic or Davies and David?
Off to the Semi final game in my home town of San Diego!!! 🏝️☀️Let's go!!!  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Many of the USMNT players should not be selected for the NT again.
Jamaica vs Guatemala was better
MATT TURNERRRRRRRRRRRRR
2:11 that’s that brown and black chemistry! Let’s go USA
Man this is soccer no football. That is why this game was so boring.
🇺🇸USA vs Mexico🇲🇽 Final again?
I can’t stand Jesus Ferreira. He has the luckiest pk and he starts celebrating like he did everything.  He does nothing in big games and only scores against nobody teams
I will forever hate the own goal rule. That should have been recorded as a goal for Busio. Technically, yes it was an OG. But I still hate it
That was heartbreaking.  Too bad the person editing this didn't bother to show us a replay of the first penalty appeal, but showed us a nice replay of the ref running back and forth to the monitor. Very important that.
Now I know why the call it "The Beautiful Game"...
What is up with black players and penalties?
Wow
what looked like a truly abysmal match produced a pretty crazy ending. imo, neither team rly deserved to win, but someone has to advance in the end. if the USA plays like that against Panama then they will get cleaned out for sure. everyone had written Canada off, but i knew that you cant just write anyone off in a rivalry match so i was nervous for this one. USA reverted to Berhalter ball (cross mania) and Herdman knows the recipe to beat Berhalter ball, but Canada's B/C team arent good enough to get it done like the A team could in the past. out of the 4 semi finalists, Panama were the only ones that rly convinced me they have what it takes to win this tournament. i am looking forward to 2025 when the Gold Cup and Nations League finals dont clash so that we can see everyone's A teams back out there
Matt Turner needs to leave Arsenal for 1st team minutes. He’s too good to be a backup goalie
I did not know Canada played soccer LMAO
Tip my cap to both teams. What an exciting game 🇺🇸!!
Im sure this was a crazy exciting game to be at and watch live. Congratz US
What a game!
USA controlled the entire game, they had 68% of ball possession, and 21 shots with 8 on goal. Canada only had 32% ball possession, 5 shots with 2 on goal. Canada was very lucky to have 2 goals off 2 shots on goal with one of them being a penalty kick. USA turned it on was able to tie and win in PK's. If your Canada how do you score 3 own goals? 2 vs Guadeloupe, 1 vs the US.
GOD BLESS AMERICA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸
I've never loved a US team more than the one I'm seeing now. They're playing with their hearts. They look like they're having fun while playing the beautiful game. ❤
We like to beat the Canadians.😅😅
The refs are inconsistent they did everything to check the VAR but with the Guatemala game they didn’t bother to check it once
Turner 2024 the hero America needs.
That second Canada goal was crazy, u could tell he wanted it
Goooooo USA!!!!!! Amazing!
Matt Turner the real MVP
That was Canada's 3rd own goal in the Concacaf Gold Cup, the other 2 own goals that Canada scored were against Guadeloupe. Canada scored both goals for Guadeloupe causing them to finish 2nd in there group due to a tie.
that was way to close
As a die hard football fan that just migrated to the US , I am glad the football passion is finally kicking in the US.. so happy the team won to make the nation know what REAL Championship feel like . Not winning a national tournament called superbowl and calling yourself world champions. This is the real deal. World cup gonna open things up definitely..
Final worthy game.
Berhalter ball is back. Spam crosses to a 5’8 center forward
THE MATT TURNER DYNASTY 🦅🦅🦅  The USA WILL overtake Brazil as the national team with the most silverware as we win 27 straight gold cups
USA USA USA
Bro those USA fans looks so sad, the cheering is so sad and boring😭
Bravo Turner 👏🏾 👏🏾
The host from that viral trivia app game sure has come a long way.
Canada did well. Future is very bright
turner stepping up as howards replacement admirably
Two of CONCACAF's heavyweights clashing, you knew it was going to be good... it turned out to be epic.
USA WITH THE B TEAM AS WELL 💪🏾👀🇺🇸
If only Canada didn’t do an own goal
Berhalter out  Fix this abortion of a coaching situation before it can do any more harm before the world cup
Why wasn’t Pulisic, McKennie, Dest, all the A1 players playing?!
This kind of handball rule realy is terrible......I can see if it was intentional.......
this was so stressful
USA!✊USA!✊USA!✊
Team got lucky AF. On to the next game.
Canada played a really nice, fare game but i think we DESERVE IT !!!!!!❤🤭 Honesty, although is exciting ti watch the penalty kick but it really feels bad for the team they loose because they played hard and just for one penalty..... ayyyyy yyyyaaayyyy!! Feel you Canada 🇨🇦 👏👏👏  Congrats to all my fellow Americans!! I think the way our team is revolving & progressing even WORLD CUP is not a far dream .. maybe not 2026 but soon enough!! 🎉🎉👏👏👏❤❤❤🎉🎉👌👍✌
This game nearly killed me.
Mattt mothafuckin turner !
Start my homie cade Cowell he brings so much energy and quickness
Let’s keep it real, usa got lucky
USA! USA!
Horrible game by robinson
Why is the US team different here than the World Cup?
These highlights were insane
COYG!!!
Trash match overall.
Great game!!
USA would always be > Canada 😂
Typical Canada lol
USA USA!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Out of sheer luck we got that win. Ggs
Bruh, how does a highlight video go from kickoff straight to 1st half extra time? Did nothing happen for 45 minutes??
Wow!  https://youtu.be/Br-834XlCZg
Jesus loves you-!!
More than half of these players are not even American 😂
USA! USA! USA!
Cowell must go to europe to polish his game
The new Matty Ice
Unbelievable
US is doing fantastic in the CONCACAF
Busio has to put both of his chances in the top corner smh
This good game all started by the man calling a penalty at 90 minutes 😂🤣 they really wanted Canada to win
Guess that some players can only score against small Caribbean islands . 🤷
I mean it’s Canada C team lol A team Canada easily beats USMNT
At this point It’s more fun to watch usa vs Canada then usa vs Mexico . I’m Mexican and I got to say our team sucks .
Turner channelling Tim krul
They need to change the handball rule in the box…when it’s obviously unintentional on the edge of the box and not even a shot, it’s hard to rule it a Pk and change the entire game.
A classic.
Miazga forgot how to defend on that second goal and Turner showing why he’s the only A player for the national team, US were so lucky
USA 3rd team beat Canada's A Team. LOL Canada sucks.
MATT IS THE GOAT !!
no unintentional handball in the box should be a penalty. it should be a free kick at the spot of the infraction. soccer needs reform.
Bosio and Turner are probably the most valuable in the game. Turner saved many goals, and bosio made the tie goal + a penalty.
not bad for the USMNT C team
rahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
This Canada side drew Guadeloupe and Guatemala in their group. We're at home and really shouldn't need to come from behind and win on PKs. Poor preformance.
Excited about the match, but FS1, it is 2023 and we're watching your highlights in "720p" resolution.  How can you upload something that looks so terrible?
Matt Turner pulling a Martinez type of show tonight. True MVP of the match there
I wonder why did Gressel played so much? He really didn’t do anything.  Plus, Cowell should start over Zendejas. Zendejas would be better as a CAM and not on the wings.
This game was insane to be at 😱🤯🇺🇲 All time classic for sure
I’m putting my money on Cowell being player of the tourney. Speed, power, team plays. Bring the gold home boys!
One of the worst games I've ever watched
This was a good game.
Usa got lucky in this game. Canada couldve won. How did the ref not make the right call when usa clearly gave the first handball. Couldve had a different outcome.
God bless Matt Turner!! An American Hero 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸!!
go USA 🇺🇸
The lack of power like pulisic, mckennie, is missing on this team but they did great.
I was there live !! Had to drink and chug beers  USA had me at a brinking point  They have to step there game up though if they will face Mexico in the final  Yedlin and Tolkien were missing from the attacking defense ( they play better)
Tbh, I thought Canada had it. US can't go in with this attitude against Panama.
Miles Robinson better be kissing Matt Turner’s feet because my god how many times this dude gonna flail his arms around where the ball is? First one probably should’ve been a penalty too.
I feel that Panama can actually pull the upset.
Turner for President 2024
USA owns Canada
As an American USA got very lucky if penalty counted could've been nore harder for USA to draw or win could've and Matt turner as being his usual self blocking penalties
Jesus Ferreira disappeared most of this game.  Goalkeeper was the best player for USA and surprised he is not starting in EPL.  Can we all say Zack Steffan who?
As soon as the ref went down first minute I knew this is a classic.
Get Neal off the field. He's slow and turns the ball over too much. The US needs to stop back passing when they don't need to. That's coaching errors.
Can anyone explain to me why our A team isn’t playing please?
Freaking Canada play horrible throughout the group stage and had the nerve to play great today against the United States 😤
Give Matt turner the balon dor
This game was crazy
What a game
Someone might got a mild heart attack on this game lol.. congrats USMNT
A Classic Game ! 🇺🇸
Turner should be Arsenals number 1
Wow
Instant classic pure insanity call it what you will.
USMNT owns canada
Vazquez getting the goal at his home stadium is fantastic
Sorry Canada, this ain't hockey. You don't win after scoring in extra time.
So happy.  Go milk your maple trees Canada, better luck next time.
Turner just needs to shave his head to bring back the Bald goalkeeper tradition
Brandon Vazquez has a beautiful header, but i knew that penalty was going way over the crossbar. If he works on his ball control he could be a dangerous player if not it'll be hard for him to make the roster next world cup
RAHHHHHH 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🦅
We got very lucky. Is this the B or C team? Because we can’t expect to give a good World Cup performance as Host if this is our A team….I liked the 3-0 USA vs Mexico team.
first 88 minutes: 💤 last 32 minutes: 🤯
*What will the final be guys?*
The United States of Gringos
If that Canadian didn’t make an own goal it would’ve been Canada v Mexico . Canada fumbled so hard like arsenal omfg 🤦🏽‍♂️
This was USA’s second or third string team too lol
This was basically this years GC final great game from Canada they deserve a metal this year
canada just stick to hockey
*These 2 put up chuch a rollercoaster game that had us in the edge of our seats!*
*Could this be the best game so far for this gold cup??* 👀👀
These are a very important next 3 years for this team probably the most it’s ever been
If we take canada to pens and we got very lucky to even take it to pens, we cant beat mexicos A team or even panama lol
And Canada heads back to putting out wildfires oh yeah I can't breathe a thousand miles away because they refuse to do that too.
USMNT doesn’t has a star player but still they made draw against England in FIFA World Cup
I love how they just skipped all the way to the 48th minute
Next game we need to start 11 Matt Turners
So many close calls but we won! 😅
USA be like: why do quiet Canada 🇨🇦
Turner saving the day once again 👍
I love you Matt ❤
Crazy game. Not the best from the US team but somehow found a way to win it.  Matt Turner was amazing on the penalty kicks.
CONGRATULATIONS USMNT AND MATT TURNER 🇺🇲👏⚽️
This game was full on pressure
Use me as a Matt Turner is #1 button  👇
Matt turner motm
Miles Robinson almost sold the game for us TWICE...coach needs to tell that man to keep his hands by his side when defending in the box smh
Matt Turner just proved why he’s the USMNT’s #1 for years to come
Matt turners first 2 blocks in that penalty shootout
As a USMNT fan. I can’t deny that we got so lucky to win this game
🦅 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
First
First
Wow
What was your favorite highlight from this game?
