You can chop and freeze your onions
impulsiveness is an adhd trait, one i also possess!
Your the best, ty for being my inspiration gr8
I am so att aged to u and give me future recepie ideas
😍🥰😍😍🥰😍😍😍🥰😍😍🥰😍😍
I’m ashamed that I struggle so much with time. Now as an adult and knowing I have dyscalculia and ADHD I can rationalise why I struggle so much. Unfortunately having that understanding doesn’t do much to help with the society attitudes of timeliness. It’s hard to admit as a successful adult you have such a wobbly  understanding of time.
Lol, Taz I’m so glad you have been diagnosed with ADHD! So funny because I started watching your channel long before I suspected I had it, I was diagnosed at 32 and can totally understand how much clarity it brought to my life. I always knew there was something going on but couldn’t figure it out… would NEVER suspected ADHD because the stereotype is so narrow. Keep readers hing into it so many great resources for adult women with ADHD now. The Podcast ‘ I have ADHD’ and the adult group coaching groups has been amazing for me, I recommend you check it out.
Lasagne , beef and broccoli , chicken fried rice
Experiment and explore cooking continental food , it'll help you boost more ideas for meal prep for the week and help you create more videos too. Good luck!
more of these videos plssss
🖤🖤
Love the accent...
Chicken fajitas are a easy tasty meal prep, microwaved if frozen/in fridge and then all you need to do is put it in a wrap!
Hi, welcome to the ADHD family we’re very weird.
This is such a good video! I would love it if this could be a series. It is so fun watching you cook and it's totally fine if you don't have new recipes everytime. It is just fun watching you cook and meal prep. 😀👍
I personally am ashamed of my lack of commitment. I have failed out of college.... twice... I have spent the last 4 years of my life unable to commit to a career or even a path in college.
Taz, a little tip for you if you did not know about it. Add one teaspoon of salt to the water you boil your eggs in, it helps with peeling a lot!!
To peel boiled eggs perfectly, as soon as they come off the stove, put them in cold water, my mom does ice water, i just do a big bowl of cold water and I peel them in the water and it usually peels perfectly
As a professional chef, just take your time. I couldn't dice onions the way I do now, so I just gave myself time to understand how before doing it. If you get overwhelmed with cooking more than one thing, that's fine and you'll get 'better' with practice. Honestly I wouldn't be able to and film it all too.
I feel so proud of you... It's inspiring since we basically the same age and I feel I'm growing with you and you make me want to step up and challenge myself. Cheers Taz!. I think I'm meal prepping now.
Taz please, so that the food tastes good when reheated: 1. Taste the food at the time of cooking and check to make sure it tastes good. 2. Wait until it is completely cold to store it. 3. Reheat it on the stove, so you can add a little water and a little more spices if you want.  This is how we reheat food in the Caribbean and it always tastes delicious :D
A thing I'm ashamed of. My mood swings and impulsiveness , I'm bipolar and yes that's not an excuse but my mood changes alot and it's not always bad but the thing I'm ashamed of are my manic moments, I've cut of all my hair, blacked out and said horrible things to people and I'm always ashamed and cry most of the time, I'm in my late teens (16) and It's only just being noticed as a issue even though alot of adults knew since I was 11. It's very toxic how I love the mania sometimes and still having to go to school on low days , so yeah that's the thing I'm most ashamed of
can anyone please tell where can I find the bowl with fork at 15:07
That sound really got me laughing my heck off 7:32
I’m ashamed of something quite similar I’m ashamed of how I just say what I’m thinking and sometimes when I think of doing something outside of my comfort zone I just tell myself to do it and just stop bieng scared and end up regreting it and bieng EMBARASSED
I wish grocery stores in the US did wonky veg boxes. We get a discount produce rack and there is like NOTHING worth buying on it because it's not much cheaper than regular produce.
I learnt how to control it and tbh I miss it because I’m now the opposite of all the positives regarding being impulsive so keep being impulsive the benefits outweigh the negatives!
love the table top insights you gave <3
l have autism and dyslexic
I'm ashamed of how i want everyone around me to like/watch the things I like/watch 😑
taz is legit me. I'm extremely impulsive, sometimes idk how to deal with impulsiveness.  i run away from problems, especially ones i didn't cause. i say too much too soon. i feel i'm too honest towards certain people, sometimes to the wrong ones to the point where my honesty isn't valued or appreciated. i feel too much and feel that i am too much most of the time. and i'm scared of changes. i try to embrace them but it gets it's difficult at times.
Ngl kinda looks like knock off drew. 👍
For peeling boiled eggs, put it in a cup, put you hand on the top and shake it. It literally falls off the egg!
Try frezer cooking.. or if you do cook dinner make a 4 or more potion of it, and freeze potion of it
i got my autisme diagnose when i was 27, way to late, but sadly 'normal' for girl/womens
Next time you have a abundance of fruit and veg, cut it up and freeze it is in batches. Then it will be ready fr whenever you need it and won't go to waste!
I'm ashamed of how i react when someone says something i don't like. I'm also ashamed of how emotional i get , like i understand that we can show our emotions but i feel like i take it too far.
Oh my goodness**
Oh goodness**
Aren't most people delay things they don't want to do until the last possible moment?
A dash of cinnamon, along with pb and banana, can make a porridge instantly less boring - if you like that spice ofc :)
Me as a german thought: "Awesome there is a Lidl😂"
I'm ashamed of so many things about myself that I don't even know where to start. I could probably fill an entire book, and I feel like like there would still be more.
I always knew you had ADHD! Glad you found yourself. :)
What's the rice cooker model name? I need one of those 😂
My lazy way to meal prep is that every time I cook, I try to cook at least 6 servings. If it's a big pot of soup or stew, I will freeze 2-4 servings for easy meals in the future (which also helps prevent you getting bored of eating the same thing or getting takeout when you are lazy).
Put some salt and sugar in your oats and it will take 10x times better. Also off the challenge instead of doing them with just water, use your favorite milk instead of water.
There are many different meals you can make with your spaghetti sauce. I use it for four things. Pastas (Spaghetti, pasta bake lasagna),  Pizza ( Don't forget the ham), and Cheat nachos ( Corn Chips with the sauce). best thing is you can freeze most of this.
You didn't wash the riceeeee
I know it's bad but I'm ashamed of my body
how do you defrost it?
great video!!!!
Amazon has broken 20kg Basmatie rice for £17....enough for a year for a family?
hey taz, where do u live in London?
Coconut rice. Brown rice, coconut milk, chilli, lime juice. Nice with any curry, chicken dishes, fish dishes its great and simple xx
Make biriyani for a meal
Please make video of cooking all week each meal from the bottom for some nice budget per week maybe 50£
Im ashamed of the way i look.
Chop the onions and freeze them 😄
Nice video
advice for anyone:i really struggle multitasking and i procrastinate a lot so when trying to cook multiple things at once i write it down because i am a very visual person.i write down the timings so i know when to do everything for example,fish chips and beans, i work out the timings so i can match them(chips take 20 but fish takes 10 so after a 10 min timer on the chips,i put the fish in so i can leave those entirely,leaving me plenty of time to cook the beans.)  work it out,and take deep breaths.remember this is just a small stress!  you are loved and you matter ❤️
I am hypersensitive and I'm just like you very impulsive but I dont view thing as bad or wrong
I'm ashamed of feeling a lot of emotions I was told I wasnt supposed to feel, but I've learnt that EVERY emotions is valid and need to be felt
I am very jealous of UK prices, 15 $ is the price I pay for 3 tomatoes in Canada THIS IS MADNESSSS
I have the exact same what are you ashamed of as you. everything that came out of your mouth was too relatable i got chills... I've found the way i deal with my more negative impulses is by writing everything down in the moment and going back to it a day.. or even just a few hours later and i usually feel differently about the situation already. it helps to write down cause even though you're not actually saying or doing anything directly it is still getting those busy thoughts off your mind so it relieves some of the urge. and it also puts things into perspective later once that moment has passed. I hope this made sense
As a person who also has adhd I really like food prep because it allows u to eta the food you're hyperfixating on for the whole week 😭😭
cut the onions next to the sink with water running, no more tears :p
I used to do a lot of meal prep/freezing for disabled adults. One real suggestion is to date all foods before freezing! I would do 3-4 different meals a week but keep 1/2 frozen for the next week, so you aren't eating the same 3 meals 4x a week. Once you get an extra week ahead frozen then you're just preparing 3-4 various meals a week, but are choosing from 6-8 different ones. I always made 1 serious protein whether chicken or pork, for example, mostly unseasoned. Then I could use it in a variety of ways, going spicy or curry, etc. New subscriber, older retired early childhood/special education teacher. Your first video I thought you had ADHD. Now you need to figure out how to make adjustments to make your life easier! You are doing great though, having a financial person very smart. You realized your random eating was expensive and not working, so meal prepping fantastic! I am very impressed by you and enjoy your frenzied style!
Play some music you love while cooking.
Taz, honestly when you described your struggles with ADHD I was relating to everything you said and now I think I need to get a screening done too lol.
I just realised how lazy some germans are with food - and I don't think it's intentional. I grew up with eating bread for breakfast and dinner and only have one warm meal for the day. Which means that you only have to cook once
Adhd
you should show us how you make it and what ingredients / how much you use , so we can also try it :)
if you freeze it there is no need to eat it within a week. so if you keep adding more and more different dishes to your collection, you can eat different things for a while until it keeps repeating. its an interesting concept. you need to cook only once a week or so, the only thing you need is a huge freezer.
4 Tips: 1. You can freeze the bananas and still use them for breakfast if you're worried they get bad too soon. 2. WASH your rice AND  Qunioa before cooking 3. Onions stay good for a long time so that shouldnt be that big of a problem 4. Taste your food while you're cooking
what are you ashamed of in yourself: the chili
could you drop the recipe of everything please
I’m ashamed of how I always tend to avoid conflict. I have lost so many friends, romantic interests, and more because a small problem arises and I distance myself from them instead of trying to resolve it.
the second dish in this vid is really delicious and easy and you can use kidney beans instead of black beans and that tastes amazing too : ) https://youtu.be/yqGtT0c5e2U
Have an idea for your meal plan Make chicken with sauce and veggies with seasonings and sauce you can add it to rice noodles pasta etc  and make patties from boiled pulses  chiken and potatoes boiled and then grind it up and add seasonings and freeze it on a tray and the next morning or after it fully frozen take it out and putt them in a ziplock bag trust me it's so good for making breakfast sandwiches and you can eat it with eggs i love and hope you like it too Just wanna let you know that everyone has a guilty pleasure that they may not be proud of but it's what completes you❤️❤️❤️❤️
make picked onions!! they go greatwith anything and last youuu a long time
I'm ashamed on how I lash out to people and how rude I am (my thoughts) i can say the harshest things and after I say them I regret it. I'm working on myself... I know for a fact I have anger issues.
Would love for a more in-depth video on ur adhd journey, the help, medication etc ♥️
U can make a mood bored its when each day u have this book and their is three colours u colour the drawing in red is not a good day orange is a meh day green is a good day and their is like numbers untill 30 or 31  and u can also write in a diary it helps :)
To cook multiple meals at once: Make a LIST sorted by length of time, tools etc... don't sit and cut all of your vegetables at once because you can cut some for the next step while the first step is cooking. Ex:  If you're making a pasta and mashed potatoes with chicken and veg-- Boil the potatoes and cut the chicken. Cook the chicken while you cut the veg. Remove the potatoes and boil the pasta in the pot the potatoes were just in, add the veg to the chicken in the pan to finish cooking. Hope that example helps?
Hey Taz I have some recipes for you that I eat mostly every day,for breakfast toast,smoked salmon and cream cheese or tortilla eggs cheddar cheese with tea ,I know you don’t really like cheese but there is a delicious vegan cheese from violife , lunch fried rice which is onion bell pepper carrot cabbage chicken garlic soy sauce fry it with some oil then added the rice
I'm ashamed of how I close my door to everyone whenever I'm mad and frustrated. I'm also ashamed of how I always get insecure to others, to a point where I always try to force myself to become better than them.
How I like to mealprep for a bit of variety: I'll make 3 portions of breakfast, on the 2nd day 3 portions of lunch, on the 3rd day 3 portion of dinner, and repeat.  I'd also love to add that often faux meats reheat better than the animal-grown meat, because plants and thus plant based meat alternatives tend to get more tender when freezing and reheating, where actual meats get a bit dry
I'm ashamed that I don't really have any plan further out than say half a year. Everyone is always like "where do you see yourself in 5 years" or "I like that you are so ambitious!" meanwhile I'm not, I'm just doing whatever and improvising my way through life.
I would enjoy seeing you do keto for a week
VLOG SUGGESTION: TRY JOLLIBEE 😁🐝 They just open new store at Wales 😊  (Jollibee is a Filipino fast food chain. It is like McDonald's but Filipino version😅)
Im ashamed of how scared I am of everything(fun part of anxiety) Im always scared I'm making the wrong decision, or I won't do something because I'm too scared for no reason
Follow struggle meals YouTube channel meal prep you can get good tips there
Hey you can do eating certain coloured food challenges or eating what the person Infront of me ordered or making Pakistani/Indian meal prep for a week 😍, hope it helps. Love from Pakistan ❤️
tips on bulk cooking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfPhqt2shtI&t=181s
I’m ashamed of my all or nothingness: if I can’t do it all then I won’t at all. And if I don’t finish in one go I’d not finish it ever unless there’s a deadline with a punishment aka homework but if there is none eg painting I wouldn’t finish
Next time you use boiled eggs in meal prep, don't peel the egg until you eat it <3 Good video!
Lol that lumpy mess is considered porridge? 😂
When multitasking while cooking always helps me is chop all the things you need for the recipes, when you are starting to finish the things you need to chop, start to preheating the oven (if you need to use the oven), and when you finish chopping you can cook on stove and oven (saves you on time) (put a timer for the oven so you don’t forget) and you just need to put all the ingredients together and done
I’m ashamed off how sensitive I can be and manipulative I can be and it makes me feel how horrible I can be sometimes
i’m ashamed of how much i let others opinions/lack thereof get to me. i’ve always hated how boys not noticing me or not being that ‘popular’ affecting me and my self confidence like why should it matter, self love always starts from within sigh
Chop the onions up and freeze them.
I've been into enneagram test and tritype enneagram lately. It's a good way to understand yourself a little bit better. But as other personality test it's not hundred percent accurate, we human are ambiguous being heheh..so, it would be great to see you making a video of you taking the tests and see if the description fits you!
I'm kind of ashamed of how unoriginal I am, and that I tend to  procrastinate (especially when I don't find something all that interesting).
London trip
Your accent,your preparation, your look,your style,your craziness everything is so beautiful  TAZ💜💜💜
Cut your onions next to a piece of kitchen roll soaked in water, no crying 🙋🏼‍♀️
I have a tip! If your bananas are going off make banana bread! It’s good for snacking and breakfast :)
Watching this at 3 am and now I'm hungry and weirdly motivated to cook :) tho I don't have the ingredients 😔
I think you should try and cook twice a week to avoid any stale or food that goes bad. Also this way you will have more variey rather than eating the same thing again and again.  ❤️❤️❤️
Hello Taz, I have some cool ideas for meals.   1. One of my favorites is the Middle Eastern Chickpea Bowl https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/middle-eastern-chickpea-bowls-5eb082c2ff8d2876ce4bf9a2 Here is a link to a Shawarma spice recipe that i use (I personally do less cardamom than suggested probably 1/8 - 1/4 tsp) https://littlesunnykitchen.com/shawarma-seasoning/  2. You could buy a cookbook from a movie series or game that you love      I like Harry Potter so I have their cookbook  or you could do a game like D&D because they have a cookbook based off the game.  3. You could go on allrecipes and look at their list of air fryer recipes
Taaazzzzz, do you defrost the frozen meals or just put them in the microwave for longer orrrr??
I have the same disorder it's a type of autism I was told that I have Aspergers. Being impulsive is not a bad thing you handle yourself very well from what I see.
I'm also ashamed because I'm also very impulsive and also because I procrastinate way to much like enough for 10 people and end up not doing the thing I had to do or on the best cases I end up doing it but really on top of the time limit if you have tips on how to better these types of behaviours pls tell me because I genually don't want to keep being like this and want to better myself so if y'all wanna help me pls feel free to in th comments😭💖
Are you a Chelsea fan? Cuz of your shirt
Cooking ideas - carrot in to shavings - it will create carrot spaghetti, grind potato and you can do sort of pancakes with it. Pancakes (wraps, rice wraps) you can use to deliver you vegies. Beans you can improve with peas and corn, and all other cans (mix them a little bit). Invest in to some spice. Bread baked with butter will transfer all flavor of what is on bread (infuse?) taste much better. Also you can do over 100 recepis with eggs and bread only try it out (i think there is even clip with 100 ways you can prep eggs alone).  For me one veggie you do not buy (and i believe is a SIN in budget food) is a cabbage. You can cook it in so many different way, that is insane (check some Polish recepis - like cabbage rolls or bigos if you want some inspiration). Use some cream to add depth and flavor. And one last thing - taste, taste, taste - You cannot cook without tasting. Sorry for my language - English it's not native for me.
One of my favourite meal plan is to get a whole chicken and stick it into a slow cooker for 6 hours on high. Cheap and easy and multitasking friendly
make a creative drawing video or crafting
OMG When you did your video on the apartment I was thinking are you ADHD they did say but I can’t and when you just said in your video I did like oh my God I love you even more girl
Why don’t u make a vid of u going to Waitrose on a budget
'that's great, love that for me' this is what we're here for
I'm ashamed of getting too  attached to people within a month of knowing them and finding it hard to leave even if they are really toxic. I'm also ashamed of not being able to sort problems out one at a time so most of the time I'm just mentally and emotionally exhausted.
im tired always all the time i cant resonate with ppl who have dreams or goals i just want to sleep eat repeat and be done i dont im  not excited to learn new stuff and get a job i just want to get through life quickly and sleep idk if it makes sense but i feel like ive given up on myself before my life had even begun because of everything around me (im sorry if you dont care just move on then <3)
Have I really been watching you for 3 or more years, it’s been so long oh my god I absolutely love you
try Dhal: I do a shit load of it and then just eat it fora few days. https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/spinach-sweet-potato-lentil-dhal
Hi Taz, try out hello fresh with discount codes of course for ideas on recipes. I’ve done that and now I use their recipes here and there ☺️
Oh Taz we love wonky veg
the chemicals in onions are attracted to a water source so next time you cut onions do any of these 3: put bread beside the table cut on a wet cutting board dont cut the eye- the bit with the brown roots
I'm ashamed of myself for never finishing what I start and never giving my best
HEYY TAZ!! you can chop up your onions and cover it with either a lot of plastic bags or put it in Tupperware then you can freeze it and it can last very long
A series where Weekly meal prep is composed of different country each week. (Sorry for my english skills, it is not my first language.
Hey! Just a tip Taz : When you're about to eat a prepped meal do not put it straight into the microwave. Let the container sit out in room temperature for a little while before you pop it in the microwave. Trust me! It wouldn't taste funky. :)
Now i think i have adhd😂
In Canada we have an app called FashFoods. It is price reduced food that is closer to its Best Buy date.
if I have a load of onions I prep them all and freeze them so when I needed chopped onions for a recipe they go straight in the pan and defrost speedily. I also Mince ginger and freeze it as it keeps much longer that way. with Bananas I do this in slices or chunks as smoothie prep. saves a lot of hassle and time :)
If you wanna eat the salmon w/out it being a few days old. Prepare what you wanna eat with the salmon before. Freeze the salmon and put it in the airfryer when you wanna eat it. Fresh salmon 👌🏼
so like what i've found that works for me is when i'm making dinner, i try to stand around as little as possible. if the oven is preheating, i'm cooking up veg, if the food is in the oven, i'm washing up what i can or getting plates out. basically, timers are your friend for keeping track of what's happening when and so i don't get too preoccupied washing dishes that i let the food burn
I’m ashamed that I’m quick to shut people off. If I felt disrespected I’ll cut that person out without thinking. No matter how mych it affects me; I’d say I don’t deserve that in my life. Then in a polite way tell me to leave them alone. As a result I have 3 friends and 2 family members
Love love love your content! ❤️❤️❤️ Your videos always bring a bright spot to my day.  Stay safe and well beautiful soul! 💕
I’m ashamed of how much anxiety I get over the most stupid things… I feel uncomfortable and the people around me don’t rly understand so they keep nagging and pushing me until I do it… sometimes it works out fine and I just feel like a big baby that was stressed over nothing.
I love how honest you are, love from cardiff🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿😀
Hey Taz! A little late to the party but the Dutch traditonally eat sliced bread with a topping for 2/3 meals every day. Very easy, the most effort it'll take is if you decide to slice your own cheese. Usually it's a spread, chocolate spinkles or like peanut butter though. Prepared within 5 minutes
Table-Talk i think the thing I am ashamed of most is my ability not to persevere and control my health, time management and organization I already have the right mentality but I always relapse and fall back to old unhealthy habits and foods.
You should totally try the Joe app for meals ideas
Manifested too hard... Haha!
Video idea!! Since you got that air fryer. Airfry some snacks and some proteins! Meal prep is boring without having the snack options in between! Maybe some seasoned airfried chickpeas? Kale chips? Green bean chips? Pasta chips? Or banana chips? Apple chips? Also to dip those chips, maybe some homemade hummus?
When are you going to  post a new video?
I honestly thought you were always freezing the foood. That's vital girl.
TAZ have you tried Gousto? Easy like you say and just a bit of coming. I think it's more flavoursome than Hello Fresh. I also save money on food every week. I don't their away rien food anymore. Just a thought! 😉 ALSO: DON'T cut the eye (root) off the onion after you peel it. Chop it leaving the eye til last = NO CRYING 😢😭🤧
this is the best, most wholesome and most helpful comment section i have ever seen
Hi I love all your videos there amazing and lovely you are a lovely person
vegan restaurants in london reviews sounds good tbh i would love seeing you try vegan restaurants
You could buy canned salmon and tuna in those pouches. :)
I’m ashamed that I’m a people pleaser. I don’t like telling people no even when I’m busy and overwhelmed.
I'm also impulsive ike you Taz, I iteraly went to a science school just to end up taking a business course even if I wanted a culinary course in the first place , I also have a hard time controlling my emotions especially when in the heat of everything. Whenever I feel like I' m going out of control there aret two things I do. First is to count til my anger is gone and if it doesnt work I remind myself of what our guidance teacher to me, "You can't control how they act but you can control how you react." Hope it helps :)
Omg Taz.  You did absolutely amazing 👏❤.   I also have Adhd.  I struggle with taking care of myself. This is a life saver plus you save on money
Some advice for cooking several meals at the same time: I went to a cooking school and before every lesson we had to plan out all of our four dishes when and how to cook them. So for example if you have something that has a longer resting time do that in the beginning and while it is resting you can easily do anything else in between. So in short: think about all the waiting times and when you need what to be done, then it should be easier for you :) and write your plan down on a paper that you'll leave right next to you while cooking. Hope that I could help you :)
Taz this for you from New Zealand. The Maori word for ADHD is Aroreretini and it means, Attention goes to many things.
I am ashamed of getting angry over small things and not having a healthy way to deal with it outside of punching a wall when nobody is looking.
No one enjoys meal prep, it's not just an adhd thing
Hi taz where is moon
as an asian, if my mum saw that rice in the rice cooker, she would spank me for not putting enough water in it
Taz did you get diagnosed via GP or private? I’m currently trying to get diagnosed
You could freeze the bananas and make a peanut butter,banana and oat smoothie 😍
I need a Taz in my life. Come to the states
God provided your awesome produce box.  I love the air fryer.  Thanks for sharing your journey in adulthood.
Taz: who doesn't like pasta  Me: literally eating pasta
I have ADD and one of the tools my therapist gave me as far as procrastinating is to just commit to the the very first task. For me that's opening up the recipe pages and a notepad. And then I write/type down all the components for all the meals I'm making at once. So like there's a PREP section for all the veg I have to chop, then a OVEN section for all the stuff that's going in the oven/temps and times, and then a STOVE section for all the stuff that goes on top of the stove so then I know if there is something I can do at the same time as something else (or not). By the time I finish that I'm usually more motivated to start prepping, then to start cooking
Can you link to the rice cooker you bought please it looks really good 😌
For one of your videos can you try Chamorro food, its from the island of Guam 🇬🇺 where I’m from. I want to see your reaction and how you make the food for fiesta. BIBAAA!!!!
A tip for cooking multiple meals at once, a slow cooker really helps with this! You can prep a meal and stick it in the slow cooker to do its thing whilst you make your other meals 😊
Watch taz become a Facebook mum
I have anxiety disorder and depression and one thing I hate the most about myself is that I procasinate too much. to the point that it's unhealthy for me. I have been holed up in my house from 2 years and haven't joined my college so I am 2 years behind my studies because I keep thinking about useless stuff and being oh you are 1 day late oh no how are you gonna handle that. from 1 day it's 2 years now. I have understanding parents so they understand it's because of my anxiety and stuff but ahhh I hate it. I just want someone to come and just set a pace for me so I can continue on but ik only I can do it. I am glad you got diagnosed. it helps when you know what exactly you have so you can plan your life around it.
honestly, the whole time im watching this im just thinking how much i love taz’s hair
ADHS is actually often wrongfuly diagnosed (on children) either because they have something different that is less well known or because they do not get enough stimulation and movement through their days. I do not want to say that you don't have it I just want to show that just because you see similar simptoms you should not try self diagnosing your self or try to convince you doctor that you have it.
meal prep ideas:  burgers meat pies tacos stew/soup baked potato  pancakes waffles poridge
Welcome to the adhd club 😂👀
I haven't been diagnosed or screened yet but a lot of symptoms I've read on Inattentive ADHD I have so I've been listening to this podcast called "I Have ADHD" and I've been relating hard. Haven't put any of her tips into practice yet cause um yeah my brain but I'll get there.
I think what helps me with impulsiveness is saying something like 'wait 5 min' to myself. The world isn't going to end if you haven't done that thing in 5 min. Then build this up to 10 min, half an hour, an hour and so on.
Maybe listen to podcasts to not overwhelm yourself while cooking?
The trick to cook 4 dishes or more at once is have all your veg, meat & pasta all pre prepped which will take you less than an hour & have it all lined up next to the cooker.Then when you set your pots on the cooker all you have to do is chuck whatevers needed in. Should take a you an hour to finish. All done in 2 hours!!
You should try to make a veggie pizza or whatever type of pizza as one of your meal prep ideas
Honestly it's not something to be ashamed of. It's not like you chose to be like this. Also, it's not a toxic trait.
i feel the EXACT same way about cooking. but i’m pretty sure i’m just lazy..
I was subscribed why back when you had spoken poetry I forgot which one but it was really touching and hit me right into he heart. So glad you have reach success in your channel!
answering the table talk: something i am ashamed of is that i have a habit of avoiding things that are difficult or hard to do. it leads to me missing out on a lot of things in life because i get scared of things and give up.
did my masters thesis in 3 days, no joke. adhd crew..yea, the food stuff as well. So i end up ordering and wasting money.
You can chop and freeze onions! They do great in soups!
i have adhd too and omg i need to do this!
Soup is a good one for using up whatever veg you have. Basically saute any onions/leeks, chuck in any veg, some potatoes, tinned lentils or beans and a stock cube and boil until it's all cooked, then whiz it with a hand blender. Will taste slightly different every week depending on what veg you've used, super healthy and great for lunches. Also reduces veg waste.
You go taz  Love your videos
I would say for the salmon that could be cooked fresh but maybe you make your sides ahead like rice or quinoa or other grain. I meal prep with my mom and we will do all the chopping and prep ahead sometimes then we just need to do the cooking. We also like to cook ahead some chicken then we can add it to different dishes as we like.
Video ideas for taz 💜 Go camping  £5 baking competition with Grackle Learn how to roller skate Attempt an escape room Follow famous morning routines for a week Best free tourist attractions in London
Hey Taz, you could do a street food video
I have the same food struggles. I put it off :D
multitasking is just a skill idk how to help yu sorry 🤣
if yu want to multitask put the rice first cus tha takes long then do the chicken then the peppers last then add them all in and the rice should be done
You can try making pizza and putting it in the freezer
New video idea. Please check out Ready Burger in crouch end! It’s like a vegan McDonald’s... vegan burgers from £2 I think they may even deliver near you for free
I would love to see more meal prepping and shopping videos. I think it would not only be so cool to watch  but it would also help you stay on top of making the meals every week.
14:22 It's actually soooo healthy
Do this with no budget, actual things you love
I could empathize with what you want to deliver and you are so good😍 so inspiring thank you💕
Hello Taz, You are a lifesaver for students. As I go shopping with a tight budget I try to think like you and try to what Taz would do
A day being BTS army 💜 please it will show your army side 🥺
eh that’s just lazy ness?
make a video.. where you go on a blind date 😅🦋
Me as a cheff i cook while listening to music
Where can I get that budget veg box?
TAZ!!!! THERES A SHOW ON NETFLIX CALLED MANIFEST AND THE DOCTOR IN THE SHOW REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF YOU, I FELT LIKE HAVING TO SAY THAT!!!! LOVE YOU!!! 💗
First criteria is a symptom of other issues too... Like I am bipolar, havw autism and during my depressions this is totally how I feel even more than usual.  Not saying you're not having adhd, but just warning people that they shouldn't immediately think they might have AdHD if they experience this too.
I am very ashamed of accepting minimal efforts when i know that people can do much more for me emotionally simply bcz i am empathetic and i feel that they use that part of me.
I’ve been working really hard on trying to remove shame from my life as it’s a horrible feeling and I believe everything we have done in life happens for a reason.. BUT. I’m ashamed at how easily I gave myself to people in the past. I had super low self esteem and I thought that me being easy would make people like me and make me more desirable. I now know that having a backbone and having standards is extremely important, but there are some people in my life who just remember me as that person and it saddens me.
I am ashamed of myself because i would really try to fix my problems and things  but in the end i would spoil it on my own
Are you gonna be bringing back your old merch?🥺 I need it
Taz, you're just amazing! Period. I can't believe you inspire me so much and you're even a few years younger than me. That's cool, keep it up 😊
Taz, impulsiveness is the colour in your life, don´t eliminate completely, age will do that anyway.
Don't freeze all your food keep like 1 or 2 days worth in the fridge
Keep the food on low heat so everything cooks evenly ish and the stuff that's cooked first put it in the oven on low to keep it hot
I'm ashamed that I'm mean but I dont mean to.
I have ADHD as well and also started randomly meal prepping this week😂I also speak before I think and am very impulsive and this used to bother me but then I realised I shouldn't have to change myself to make other people more comfortable. Now I just think at least I'm not boring🤷🏻‍♀️
Hi Taz please let me know where did u got tested? I want to get tested as well
Eggs need to be fresh, plus we do meals once a day and leftovers put in fridge, and I love whole chicken cause we have leftovers for two days! Also you could have mild autism, e.g. Aspergers like me too, plus I got counselling after 22 years try to get it, and I think food is more cheaper where you live too! 😎
im ashamed of my tummy, i need to murder it
spoken poetry on cooking or adhd - video idea
One thing I'm ashamed of is I think people think I'm a really good and kind person but a lot of the time I don't feel that about myself. Like I do try to be nice but sometimes I don't know if I'm actually nice or if I'm trying to be nice and now I'm worried of ever showing myself not to be a nice person
I have some recipes that I saved on Instagram that I can send to you if you want
An idea for eggs to keep them longer and just delicious is Korean eggs ( hard boiled and in a "soy sauce" marinade in the fridge.
Its kinda funny, once you get diagnosed and then go and see what it means and accidentally deep dive then realize exactly how much of your life was it, its like taking the red pill or the ah ha moment followed by a few expletives especially when you remember how you use to beat yourself up for something without knowing it wasn't your fault. I got diagnosed April and it's kind of a wonder how many people I either know or watch who have remind me of me who are also ADHD. My biggest tip for trying to get through the tasks that are boring is to make them fun, and try follow the 3/10 rule where you work for 10 minute then break for 3. The trait I have that I am ashamed of is that I can be too blunt, like a child who does not filter for peoples feelings. It is not intended with malice  and most a just statements of fact i.e. the shirt makes your torso look squished/ That shade of purple does not look right with that shade of blue.
I make  chicken breast strips  cook a batch then reheat  little bit in microwave and add to wraps  with salad  .  Make pilau  it tastes better than boiled rice  .  Brown an  onion  add a chilli garam masala salt  and chicken  cook for 10 mins  transfer to  your rice cooker  add rice and water. Tastes bomb with raita
Try indian food u can store them as well
How tf does a person feed themselves for a week with like 20 dollars??? Wait nvm I live in California it's expensive here. I still think that's very little.
"We basically struggle a lot doing tasks we don't enjoy to the point that we put it off and won't do it until the very last minute."  I might have adhd. If at least mild because not only is this quote super accurate but there's so many other symptoms I relate too.  Edit: Typos
For variety's sake try out prepping ingredients you can mix and match and veggie/snack trays
OMFG MEEEEEE!!!!! Having kids only made me learn how to cook for them and not even myself. I try so hard but it just doesn’t work sometimes. I need to learn how to do this.
Love your videos Taz. You’re so cute 🥰
When peeling eggs, place two-three eggs in a container with a bit of water and a tight lid. shake it until the shell cracks and you can slide the shell off right away.
I pre chop onions and peppes then freeze them so they don't go bad then just throw a chunk in when I need some.  Also butter beans meal idea. Large lima beens with butter, garlic, onion, pepper, and salt to taste. cook until the beans are cooked and the water turns to a bean broth. I add skinless kielbasa the last 30 min but it isn't necessary and it will lightly change the taste.
Eating healthily lol
You could cook three days of food 2x a week instead and mix it up. During summer i like to prep stuff like taco bowls, pizza dough,burgers, skewered meats, cold pasta salads.. And during winter we like rice and beans, stews, roasted meats and pastas.
You wanna def do a bunch of chopping up!!! Even if you chop stuff up and leave it in the fridge till you move to the next meal... And if u do something like bolognese, then u can start it and put it on the burner at the back on a really low heat so everything kinda cooks slowly. And that's a low risk of burning kinda dish. So pair slower cooking things with the ones you need to give more attention to!
Pro-tip Taz you can make perfect quinoa in the rice cooker, just add a little more hot water than you would for rice!
What’s the process for ADHD screening through the NHS?
I love you
i need more of this😩😩 cant keep rewatching the vids from two years ago, but i will if i have to😂
Lasagna 😍😍😍
I feel like the thing I'm most ashamed about in myself is I've stopped caring about things I used to love.  I used to love my job & now I just do the bare minimum. I used to love planning things, going out & seeing friends.  Now I'd rather just stay home. I keep telling myself its the pandemic that's made me stop caring. Just hope I get over this feeling
Ashamed of my controlling personality 🤣
I know it sounds obvious but meditation helped me with my intense emotions and helped me control them in my relationship 😬❤️ Even just sitting still quietly and breathing for 6 minutes each day was enough that even my partner noticed a change!
Yay, lady adhd rep ☺ i have to meal prep or i just dont eat. Ive gotten really into using subscription app by the channel sortedfood, which basically gives a ton of ideas and reads it too me so im not forgetting lol.
Best tip for cooking and not getting overwhelmed is “mise en place” which in cooking means to get all your ingredients measured and chopped beforehand and put in little bowls and things so you can just dump and add and focus on cooking and not chopping + measuring + cooking all at once 😵‍💫 It really helps me to not get overwhelmed 💖
Keep the bananas in the fridge it slows down the riping process.
I just remembered about your channel after I think 2 years
Instead of making entire meals, make curry base and freeze it in the shape of cubes, separately boil and soften your meat options freezing individual portions, and blanch your greens Freeze all of them  Then, you can mix things up as you wish throughout the week  Like boil your rice and meanwhile mix your curry base with veggies or meat or both, add a little butter and cream  Or make/ buy a naan and prepare your half ready curry with it  May be a bit of curry paste with spinach and cottage cheese to go with your bread etc etc
You can do a burrito kinda thing...with some kind off chicken curry or something and u can store it frozen too. Heat it up whenever you want to eat
girl i feel we're the same person just that you're further in the future and more successful
Koreans make side dishes called banchan. They make it and eat it with rice and soup throughout the week I believe. The only thing they make fresh everyday is Rice and soup I believe and sometimes eggs. You should look into it. I've tried it a few times and I like the food i make throughout the week
I'm ashamed of losing my hair my forehead is looking huge 😅✌ i spend most of my time wearing a cap
Hi Taz ! And everyone else reading that :) So what helped me with my impulsiveness was mindfulness meditation. It's pretty hard to do at the beginning, especially if like me, you're always lost in your own thoughts and your own world but it does work. At some point, I found myself realizing I was about to do or say something that wasn't good. If you're more aware of what you do while you're doing it, you can better address the situation before it's too late. Besos !
A tip to help cooking multitasking: set timers!! Every time you put something on, set a timer for it. Also anything that is cooking/frying, chop whilst they cook!
I am ashamed of how much I don't believe in myself, like if there is a test or presentation in school or I am applying for a job or even just wearing an item of clothing that stand out from sweats, I will tell myself I can't do it and that I will make a fool of myself and these feelings will make me push off doing that thing till the last minute but deep down in my heart I know I can do it because I have worked hard or done it before.  I feel like it is a constant battle between my mind and heart, my heart wanting me to grow and do my passions and what I am capable of and then my mind is saying yes but you could fail so you probably just can't do it. I am working on it slowly but surely and I hope someday I will be able to do things with full confidence in myself and my abilities.
Here is a trick I use: just prep the sauces and do things like pasta or rice freshly or every two days! Those thinks are (especially with ur new rice cooker) so easy and fast to do. Then ur meal wouldn’t taste old or plain after a while!
Hi taz- I’m not very good at cooking but here’s a chicken/quorn curry I make and it’s super easy- Can of coconut milk, Quorn/chicken, Can of tinned tomatoes,  Jar of chicken tikka curry paste Lots of chillis, An onion (or 2 depending on the size) Cook the quorn/chicken first with the onions until the chicken is cooked, then add the curry paste and chillis, then add the coconut milk and the tomatos and leave to cook for a bit :) should take about 30 mins and I always make white rice and have a naan with it which you can put in the freezer as part of your meal plan. Hope this helps you :)
Try to be vegan for a week! That would be very interesting!! Ly ❤️❤️
Question: did you wash the rice?
do you not have to deforst the meal before you cook it, or did you just not film that part
Taz maybe you can get yourself used to meal prepping and when you start getting bored of food you can meal prep for less days. Like you mean prep for food on Sunday and on Wednesday again so you can incorporate foods like salmon without felling like you  could get  sick
I’m ashamed of not working as hard as my potential suggests, in school and in life ect. Primarily stems from my innate/ subconscious assumptions that I’m already “smart” or “well off”, however in my soul I know I’m capable of much more which always drives me. I’m combating this by taking a step back and constantly reminding myself that there are people that I want to be better than, but I should be happy and acknowledge their success whilst simultaneously working on myself to ensure I become better than them in what it is that we’re intrinsically competing in.
This may be stupid question, but if you don't seem to like your cooking so much, or the flavors you mix together, have you thought of using recipes from the internet or a cookbook to help?  I do enjoy your videos!
Have you thought about getting a boyfriend who can cook 👨‍🍳?
One tip is that I live with my boyfriend but always cook 4 portions so I can freeze half and the second time we eat is basically free✌🏼
You could make banana baked oats, a banana bread or even bananas and custard for dessert
Anyone else use cooking everyday as therapy?
I haven’t watched your video in about 3 or so years. It’s good to see your cooking skills have improved.
in the evnings there is slightly off veg at the back of my lidl for frre i usally get brocili or lettice for my rabits but yee
hey taz, how do you get those voice over's in your videos??
take a spoon and crack the shell of the egg by hitting it slowly.. crack it in to small pieces then peel it..   it will help you to save the boiled egg.. thank me later.. ;D
Taz u could sign up 4 hello fresh ❤️
Great video just make sure you wash your rice
FOOD TIP:  I think the food tastes better when you warm it on the stove rather than when you microwave it
Instead of preparing all the food ahead have you ever thought of meal prep like you could do a slow cooker meal where you add the ingredients in in the morning and it cooks all day.  Sometimes it's torture though because it smells so good.  Then you would have enough of the meal to eat a few more days during the week
Please do a collab with Uncle Roger 😂
Fellow adhd’er here! Thank you for being so open about your recent diagnosis. I have the same problems when it comes to cooking. Helps me feel I’m not alone. Thanks again 🤍
i would advice you to cook pasta when you eat it. The sauce will get yummier in the fridge, but the pasta will suffer. Same with rice. Bread you can put in the fridge, I would advice you to put it in especially if you toast it anyway, if not, just take out what you'll be eating 30 min before eating.
Slow cooker dump bags!!!! This is the way forward!!
If you boil the eggs with a splash of vinegar in the water it will make them easier to peel!! TAZ PLEASE SEE THIS ! 💖💖💖 love your account so much!! Best human ever! If you’re ever in Copenhagen hmu! Always welcome to crash on my couch 🙈🙈 (23y/o female FYI)
For meal prep maybe you can try making pasta salads? That’s some that I meal prep quite often. Sandwiches too!
this made me take an adhd test out of curiosity and I scored really high! Anyone else?
My notifacation didn't work 👁️👄👁️
You can maybe try making Indian Vegetable Pulao (similar to the rice dish you made) or other different types on Indian rice dishes since there are MANY out there.
I think I should go for a screening actually, since I relate to you so much and some of my friends have said I might have ADHD aswell
You might  want to invest in  a slow cooker, you can just throw everything in it and let it cook x
Taz You're Awesome and We Love you! Maybe you know that already but I decided to remind you again!😄😍💖
Whenever you feel like cooking, make enough for several portions. Eat one and freeze the rest, that way you build up a stockpile but don't have to spend an entire day cooking.  You can also just freeze raw ingredients (e.g. soups, instant pot or slow cooker recipes) in a bag, then put in cooker when you want to eat it.
3:57  Taz want to show the rice cooker picture. -also Taz  who can't find where it is🤣😂
there are so many channels devoted just to meal prep!! you'll never get tired of the variety if you branch out one experimental recipe per week! xoxo
I'm poor and don't live in an area with good food choices but I love watching food prep vids
I am a working wife and i do cook everyday and now since malaysia still under total lockdown, i have been working from home since march 2020 and has been cooking 3 times in a day it is exhausting but my mom teached me a trick, to prepare basic paste that can go with anything example u can fried it with rice, with noodles and even with pasta. I will give u the recipe Onion Garlic Ginger Dry chilli paste Salt Sugar  How to do Blend all the 4 1st ingredients Cook it until u get like an oily texture then put sugar and salt according to ur need stir and once ready u can put it inside ur ice tray frost it down, if u feel like cooking, just put 1 at time depending on ho much u cook during that particular time, be creative, u can add anything u want. It saves me alot of time. We Malaysians called it sambal.
Look at Pinterest for meal ideas it’s honestly a game changer! (And kinda obvious)
Pinterest is so good for meal prep ideas & recipes 🧡🧡
Get onion goggles they are the best thing I’ve ever been gifted looks ridiculous but works man
As another adhd girl to another, I’m so happy you’ve been diagnosed there are so many undiagnosed girls with adhd and I’m happy you have answers to your questions babe🤍
One thing I have found with ADHD is hyperfixation to certain things. If anyone has any tips on how to help this please let me know x
i’ve been watching you for the last three or four years and you’ve just grown so much ☺️ i also was diagnosed recently with adhd as an adult and it’s so interesting to be able to explain why you are the way that you are after so long. hearing you say something similar to my experience was so reassuring.
Do another day of culture food like, one specific culture’s food for the whole day
Hey Taz, love the video! Probably already been said, but some tips on the porridge:  You can make porridge in the rice cooker. Just chuck in equal parts liquid and oats and turn on.  When you cook things in the microwave, cover the bowl with clingfilm and pierce it a few times. Stops it from exploding over the sides!
This video helped me release some anxiety :)
Taz I cook all the meals in my household. I would highly suggest a food processor if you don't have one. I held off for years on getting one because hey I can cut veg.! It's amazing how fast you can chop up veg with it, and here is my tip for you: chop up all of your onion and freeze them in freezer bags. Instant  pre-chopped onion for whenever you need it. Do the same thing for lots of veg except potatoes which don't freeze well and turn black. (they oxidize ) As for multitasking: cook rice, sheet pans of roasted veg etc while you prepare the other parts of your meals. I also don't plate up meals in containers, but rather have larger containers for each thing : veg, all the meat, all the rice etc. Then you can mix and match whatever you want for your meals depending on how you are feeling! I hope that helps!
Pls could u do a video on adhd x
Procrastination. I procrastinate things I need to do, things I enjoy, things I don’t want to do; everything. I will sit doing nothing essentially while panicking because I’m not doing things I need to be doing or want to be doing. It sucks and I’m pretty ashamed of it and I’m more ashamed of the fact I don’t work as hard as I should to fix it
Just watched this video so maybe my video ideia is coming a bit late but why not do a "I tried the glam lifestyle for a week" meaning you would wake up a little earlier to get skincare, makeup, hair all that stuff done, put on a glam outfit and maybe even a small hell just to see how that would affect you day tp day life even trying those big acrylic nails and really take it up a notch
Hey, my idea for you ;) :   Hearty oat bags:  Ingredients (one serving): two eggs, 38 g oatmeal and 40 g milk (e.g. oat milk), a herbal mix  The ingredients must all be thoroughly mixed and finally put into a round pan. There you just fry it all. Once finished, you can add avocado pieces, tomatoes, cheese, ham, sauces and cucumber to one half of the “pancake”. Then the whole thing is folded up. I love them so much and it‘s REALLY easy and quick :).   You’ve got to try it! :) 🤍
Video 💡idea . Try Hello Fresh
Why don't you put the peanut butter in the milk and oats in the pan instead of your bowl? It'll melt and mix a kit easier! Also, add chia seeds in the pan for added omegas!
I'm ashamed of how boring I think I am. I haven't figured out who I am yet and I think it should have happened already. I don't have many hobbies or anything interesting about my life. I wish I could grow into this intriguing and unique person but I'm scared it will never happen.
You could always do a meal prep series. Where you try new meals you find/ are suggested and videoing it will help you keep the habit? Just a thought 💙 love you and best wishes taz! The trait i most hate about my self is that even though i feel myself getting better mentally i constantly doubt everything i say (also impulsive) and im trying so hard not to teach my 2 year old my same issues or be a hypocrite to her 😔
Just one thing…. Wash! the! Rice.
I meal prep at uni one of my favorite cheap meals to make is cheese and potato pie (it's brilliant with baked beans)  You need  2 white onions 5 large potatoes Cheddar cheese (I think its supposed to be about 200g but I just bung in loads) Knob of butter Splash of milk (to soften the mash) Salt and pepper to taste  1peal and boil the potatoes until soft drain and mash with milk and butter 2 meanwhile slice and fry the onions until soft 3 add onions and half of the cheese to the mash and put in a casserole dish (line or grease the dish first) 4 top with the remainder of the cheese and put in the oven on 200°c until the cheese is melted and golden  5 enjoy! I always serve mine with beans and often some thick sliced bacon or gammon.   It's honestly such an easy recipe and a life saver as a student since its so cheap and filling.
ADHD gang!!!!
Honestly when I got diagnosed I was put on medication for it and it was the most helpful thing that I had ever done or got to use. Xx
Slow cooker is a good idea for easy meals. You can get slow cooker liners so you can cook multiple dishes at the same time and you don’t even have to worry about it. Leave it for a few hours and it makes good sized portions so it’s easy to container up and pop into the fridge/freezer
A clothing haul/ home haul please 🙃
Hey Taz My meal plan consists of writing down the meals I want to eat for the week, the groceries I need. Then I do batch cooking specially with onions if more than 2 of my meals requires onions I chop and saute approximately the amount of them I need for my meals in a same pot saving time. Same with ginger garlic paste crush in advance. Prep all your veg and meat 1st then start cooking. If you can use the same pan without having to extreme wash them before cooking the next meal is very time saving. Also instead of eating 4-7 same meals a week what I tend to do is cook 4-5 of the same meal for the month and freeze them. As in 1 box 1 a week. It gets less boring and also alternate the cuisine. I try new cuisine pretty much every month just to taste new food. Hope it helps.
The vaxx contain the mark of the beast  Satan war against humanity has began https://youtu.be/-b7FR7XIdIA
As someone who has ADHD and has since I was 5 that’s 23 years 🙈, looking at anything you have too do as half full not half empty and that can be hard but like look at it as what I have already done not what you still have too do.
Video idea!!! Explore London and take us with you!! (of course when it is safe to do so)
“We have artificially been blessed” when Taz said that bless her she sounded so happy w the lighting. Taz is so genuine nd I feel likes she’s one of the most really YouTubers I’ve watched. She’s my top fave 100% x
Hey Taz! I came up with a yellow curry, that most people love. It is really simple and easy to make and freezes perfectly. I always to it when I have a busy week ahead. And the pasta with tomato and feta cheese from tiktok is really amazing and suuuper quick to make. Also perfekt to do simultaneously when meal prepping. Just leave a comment or text me if you are interested in the recipe :)
I'm ashamed of the fact that I never let somebody offend someone else (like a friend) but I let it happen when they offend me...
I find onions less hellish if i soak them in a bowl of icy water and ONLY take them out of that bowl to cut them, then put the cut onion straight into a second bowl of ice water before draining when im done. The secret weapon to onions is a food processor lemme tell you.
you might enjoy @how to ADHD to learn some tools and strategies to manage your everyday tasks :) Sending love and sunshine
Before u scoop the rice out of the cooker, you should fluff it up (aka just mix it around without breaking the rice)
I love your channell. My friend recommended it. I don't like to spend ages on cooking either. I do bulk cooking so I make curry paste a freeze it and that last me over 1 months. If you know you need to sweet loads of onions i do that all at the same time in 1 pot. Curry's are really good to freeze.
You and ADHD is between you and your loved ones and professionals, but I think it's kind of obvious that putting off things you don't like to do is being a human.
I would love you eating school lunches for 24 hours or eating MRE’s for 24 hours
I am ashamed of my inability to follow through. Another way to say it is a lack of self discipline or lack of perseverance.  I get so tired and discouraged. I am ADD too but at a young age I became afraid of my own anger and frustration. So I would often stop before I got to the point of anger or frustration. I get knots in my stomach just thinking about the pressure and failure of my youth. I try not to think of m present failings at all. I don't like being miserable so I try not to take stock of my life.  Gosh this sounds so depressed. I am realizing I have been functioning with low level depression for over a year and a half now.
I'm ashamed of how easy I give up on something its a struggle that I can't allow myself to take challenges but its fine I'm working to be a better person
Taz salmon is amazing in the air fryer. You can have raw portioned out salmon (you can buy it this way or portion it yourself). Then just pop the frozen portion of salmon in the air fryer and add a sauce or seasoning. I use either a sweet chili sauce from a bottle but many use a teriyaki or lemon spices and butter. Any way it is my very favorite way to prepare salmon. A single portion frozen can take around 15 minutes. You can Google it. I also add some frozen  baby potatoes I picked up super cheap ( a serving is only half cup so the bag lasts forever). I like to eat it on salad (yep even the potatoes). Or I will quickly sauteed some spinach or kale with a little spoon of minced garlic in oil from a jar and a tsp of oil. I like to add a splash of lemon juice which I buy in a bottle after letting hundreds of lemons go bad. The bottles stuff taste fine and last a long time without spoiling. You could have it on quinoa ❤️
You can make cured salmon. Can eat it for a whole month and it’s good
Since you know know you have ADHD, how about trying a BulletJournal for a video?
you can do salmon in the air fryer, i do it all the time its great :) literally just whack it in and come back later to eat it
To multitask when cooking (especially if you're not used to that), you need to think about the time that it takes to cook particular things and plan it all out. You can even write it down. That way you will know what you can start cooking at the same time and what you can do right after.  About freezing, I was wondering while watching your previous videos, why you didn't do it, because when it comes to food, week can be a long time. Also things like pasta or rice (if you're eating rice separately and not mixed in the pan or something) you can cook it when you need it. Now that you have ricecooker, you don't have to worry.  I think that instead of full-meal prep, half-meal prep could be better. Like making the sauces, frying meat etc. and freezing everything, so you're not forced to eat something, but you can choose what you want.  I am ashamed that I'm lazy, I don't do things that I need to do because I don't like it, to the point that it's all too much for me and I don't want to do it even more. I'm also ashamed that I can't bring myself to do things that I want, this is mostly because I'm scared that what I'll do will suck, but it still makes me ashamed.
Have you ever made banana nicecream? Just give a try, it's a good way to use extra bananas :D ps. I just found your channel and bingewatched.. You are amazing <3
I was diagnosed with ADHD is grade 5... has not been fun over the years. But having the diagnosis has opened a few doors over the years. I hope you continue to use your poetry and creativity as a coping mechanism to get you through things.
Fellow 30 year old ADHDler here. Meal prep is not working for me...I would prepare, eat the stuff for 2 days and then be like "Njergh, don't want that" and the prepared meals go to waste...
From @Pineapple  1. Learn a language for a week.  Maybe Japanese? (or use a language app for a month)   2.

use your air fryer for chicken, fish and stuff, it gets crispy and it's healthier
Do you have a link to the rice cooker please
try the different ways to prepare ramen video!!!
How about wearing the same outfit for a week… but finding ways to change it up
Try a slow cooker if you get stressed by too many things to prep at once and tray bakes can be a lifesaver too. Also try prepping everything that is similar, like prep rice, quinoa while you are cutting up veggies. There are great power hour ideas on the kitchn YouTube channel. Good luck 😊
A trait I'm kind of ashamed of is probably my poor time management because people always have to wait for me and I'm most certainly barely on time. I don't want to disappoint people and disrespect their time but i just cant properly handle this.
Try out TikTok life hacks they would be interesting
I like doing a half-prep of certain meals if they wouldn't be good microwaved and/or 5 days old. So for salmon, I might cut it into portions and freeze it  and also create whatever breading/sauce to go on top and whatever side to go with it. Then I'd pull out one portion of uncooked salmon to thaw each day and cook it - maybe stick it in the fridge when you take out your breakfast so you're more likely to remember. I find that even if I have to cook a little, knowing that it's really quick and will taste better fresh means it isn't a problem for me to get up and cook it.
uhm taz did you like wash the rice bcs rice is dirty
Why don’t you do a dish with salmon but leave the salmon until you’re eating it and you can use tinned salmon or tuna?
Make a big batch of stock to make loads of different soups. Loads of mince and turn it into cottage pie, chilli, spag bol and lasagne. Cook a chicken then make pie and curry and shred some for wraps with different sauces.
idk it work or not i hear it from somewhere that if you don't put onions and garlic in your food it won't taste funky maybe idk not sure
I think you need an instant pot to make your life easy and to try cooking more😊😊😊
Here are some video ideas I like: - the 24-hour challenges, where you eat food from different countries. That's fun.  - lookbook videos, I adore your style - budget shopping - Poundland videos -budget eating - 24 hours of making food in air-fryer Will add more when i think of them. :D
Trying food in London
Taz, to answer your question of how to cope for example with impulsiveness, I really recommend you to go to specialist. Correctly conducted therapy can change your life and I think showing that it's not a shame to seek for help will also be very encouraging for your audience.  I don't know how it looks in UK but I can still see that there is this stigma on ppl who use the help of a psychotherapist. And it shouldn't be! If you have broken leg u don't wait, same is with head and emotions.
You are love taz❤️❤️
You can keep the bread in the fridge, it keeps it fresh
My tip is.... don't worry too much about the timing part....just keep in mind not to cook two things that requires constant attention at once....and also....I think that rice gets kind of weird after a few days.......why don't you make fresh rice......it's very fast in a rice cooker
Don't worry Taz. The brain is actually not designed to multitask. You should focus on 1 task after another.
I'm currently being evaluated for ADHD too and I have the same problem! However I hate eating food that's been in the fridge longer than a few days, washing so many containers and I also only like eating what I feel like having that day so I just make a lot when I cook and then eat it over the course of 2 days topped up with some healthy snacks I don't have to prepare instead of meal prepping for the whole week :) but then again I actually really enjoy cooking I just hate cleaning up after
Make the kale chips
If you want salmon in meal prep/easy salmon recipe I suggest buying hot-smoked salmon (not cold-smoked where it is those raw thin slices, this stuff looks like a regular salmon fillet already cooked and will be near the cold-smoked stuff). They normally come in packs of two so you could have one with say rice that you've already prepared and then have the other one mixed in with some pasta and philadelphia for a nice pasta dish or with some noodles or something. They usually have fairly decent use-by dates as they are kinda 'preserved' and since they just come in twos you could eat them on say day 1 and day 4 without getting that scary day 7 salmon feeling!
Somebody introduce Taz to Dal! Dal chawal (lentils and rice) is basic AF, easy to make, delicious, filling and the variety is insane!
Another ADHD'er here! And, an easy meal prep idea. I fry chopped garlic and chilli in oil then add passata. Let it simmer on low for 15 min ish and store in jars. Then when you're hungry cook some pasta and the sauce is ready to use. Add meat, fish or veg to the dish! So easy and lasts ages.
Am just so proud of you ! Keep cooking and it will become a much easier task. I was very slow but over the last year, cooked all my meals and now it feels so much easier! If I catch myself pondering about it, I stop - Open pantry and make whatever vegetable / lentils / grains you have in stock ! all the best Taz xo Also read that processed foods aggravate ADHD so you are definitely in the right direction !
I think I'm ashamed of how "unproductive" i am. I really wanna be the busiest person ever but due to some circumstances i can't. But i still blames myself for this. 🙃
Try the meal prep king plan book it’s great 👍🏻
Welcome to the adhd fam✨✨✨ follow howtoadhd on youtube for more explanation
I don't have a dishwasher in my place. The thought of washing all those containers by hand is giving me anxiety.  I know, I am weird. But everything in my house is a set of 4. I hated washing dishes growing up, so this stops me from piling up dishes. hahahaha
Try boiling eggs the asian way. Add in a bit of salt and vinegar. I swear it works all the time. Honestly, I've never done any food prepping. So I only cook once a day and that's lunch and dinner. I'm just lazy 😅
Did you washed the rice first??!!😐
My country does not have those kids of deals 😂 like cause transport is so expensive you can't actually go to the cheap markets (I live like dead centre in a city) so fruit and veg is hard to come by at reasonable prices so my roommates and I all buy bulk deals that last us a month and cost a fraction of the price
You should just chop all the onions and freeze them in ziplock bags so you won't have to cut onions when your cooking just use the chopped ones from the freezer
Hey Taz, I have ADHD and this is something that I used to struggle with. I got my medicine increased by the doctor and it’s been great, really focused and motivated now!
I also got diagnosed with adhd, at 23 years old. There are a lot of ways to work  on yourself and to help with the symptoms, yet the only way I can suppress the impulsivity is with medication. Since I don't want the side effects of stimulant medication I use Strattera. Doesnt help too much with attention and focus, but does wonders for (internal) hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Gives your brain those few seconds of 'pause' before saying/buying something out of impulsiveness.  Just a tip! 👍🏼
the loyd pasta sauce is so gross i had it and it tasted so bad like wine
U post a video and my day becomes bright...please post more and regularly
Try to make healtyh deserts! With a budget!
a good breakfast can be chia seed pudding with some honey and  in the morning maby add fresh fruit
Your suppose to freeze the food 🤦🏾😂💀
Baked chicken breast with lemon pepper seasoning on it and veges
I love it this food
Sushi
I'm ashamed of how much of a procrastinator I am. Idk. people see me as lazy, but what I feel is demotivated. Now I'm starting to think what if I'm just really lazy like what they said? I've quit my job (bc mental health) and doing freelancing atm. I have a lot of hobbies but even that I can't be motivated to do. All I want is to stay in my room forever and I'm ashamed of how much I wanna do that. I'm still earning and able to give to my fam but idk I just feel worthless. I've downloaded some apps. And even tried the link on Taz video for a professional help but there's no way I could afford that. So yay
i have a similar case with you but with ocd, i don'twant to self diagnose but ive been doing strange stuffs since i was grade 4 (i am in grade 12 now) and i can't help it, but i can still hide it but when i'm alone i can't stop it. i used to blink at every lights in my classroom, rearrange my sit at the end of the class for no reason and repeatedly putting my bag on and off the chair until i'm satisfied enough. i walk back and forth off the room and turn the lights switch on and off until i'm satisfied. I was thankful that i don't have a cleaning ritual and more of an obsessive thoughts, but now i wash my hands and hair everytime they touched something, it's so tiring and i got sick from it a bunch of times. Now my parents are noticing my mental disorder, i didn't told them because when I tried opening up about my depression before, they didn't believed me, so i just dealt with it on my own. but i can't hide this because they are showing even if i don't want them to. I hope i can recieve help too :)
Use your air fryer for the salmon, that way it's fresh and the rest of the meal is prepped
Definitely enjoyed the vid.👏🏽❤️
some flexible dish types: stir fry, ratatouille, roast chicken, fried rice, sheet pan veg & sausage, burgers, lasagna, quiche, shwarma, curries, noodle soups, mac and cheese with veg, tacos
Ashamed of being afraid to talk harshly and fight for my rights+ the way i live with my family
Tazz, what you said at the beginning is literally me, I love eating but just thinking about the whole process it’s long, I just want the food there in front of me ready. Thought I was the only one feeling like this and being ‘ lazy’ as everyone around me says. Trying to get into meal planning too, just on time with the video
Taz! Watching you talk about your ADHD felt like you were talking about me. I've had ADHD my whole life, but since I am a girl people just thought I was over talkative and weird. I got diagnosed in my late teens but I have never been properly treated for it, so I have been learning to deal with it on my own. I am quite impulsive and I don't think before I speak sometimes. School was hell because I procrastinated hard and could not concentrate on something unless I was interested (but that was rare). I am easily irritated, can't let go of things when I am mad and I talk WAY too much sometimes. Maybe you can relate. It's definitely hard to deal with and is always an uphill battle, but I am trying my best to be more self aware and work on myself. Now that you are aware of what you have and the symptoms that come with it, you will be able to take the steps you need in order to control your bad habits. I wish you the best of luck ADHD buddy!
Something that freeze well for meal prep is Soups. I like red peas, chicken and vegetables soups.
The legendary question  Crunchy or smooth peanut butter
tbh i would really recommend just prepping like chicken/beans/tofu, a grain, and roasting or steaming a couple sheets of veg and then you can mix and match throughout the week. most of that stuff still freezes well too, or lasts for at least 3-4 days in the fridge. i have adhd too 🤟🏾
multitasking is good untill you can't do anything with out it :(
Hey Taz, here’s a tip for cutting onions. The reason that onions make your eyes water, is due to the fact that when you cut into an onion the particles that are found in onions, they often need a liquid source to latch onto. And this source is generally your eyes. So essentially the onion particles latch onto your eyes and sting them. So to stop this (I even use this trick) you can wet a towel or flannel under some cold water and set it beside the chopping board that you are cutting the onions on. This will make the onion particles find their liquid source closer to them (the wet towel or flannel) instead of sorely, stinging your eyes.  Hope this helps!
I honestly could watch a video like this again 😅
something with thrift shopping/home decor
Video idea: cooking ur favorite meals.  That would be helpful for me cuz i live on my own and suck at cooking so all i eat is frozen food. Love u 💙
Film a colab with grace, and do some cooking or baking and have a long chat
I'm really ashamed of my stuttering. It's not that bad, but when I get nervous, stressed out or panicky (I have light anxiety), it worsens it. I tend to overthink it too much and it gets worse, I get sadeder and angrier because I know it's something I can't control but at the same time I'm making worse by overthink it.. The human brain it just stupid or is it just mine that came with some defect on it? And the funny thing about all this, I work in a clothing store where I have to force myself to speak to people every single day
little tip-  use second day rice in fired rice to stop it going mushy
A good tip for meal prepping multiple meals at once, make most of the meals pretty similar or ones that use the same few ingredients so like a few meals that use pasta so you can just cook a big batch of pasta and separate it for each meal, or a few meals that need rice. or if all your meals have chicken cook as much of it together as you can. ^_^
I would normally listen to music and kinda flow with it. Like i would believe i’m in my own world.
Tip: you can chop and freeze  the unions  and they will be  fresh when you need them 🥰
Spring roll in a bowl Tacos/ fajitas/ quesadillas  Soup - really easy!  Meat cheese crackers grapes (CHARCUTERIE style)
Never be ashamed of being you when you are able to accept any areas not working for you and move forward, you are already winning,, no-one is perfect.. no-one!
Are you sure that the Dr is right and your just not normal? and the Dr is not just pushing treatment
Video idea 🚨.. please just go for a walk, shopping, park, next to a river. Missing being able to travel to places and just watching others be somewhere else is so good. Also try cooking things you like getting from takeout places, if you keep meal prepping and freeze you will end up with a good selection. I’m also an adult that didn’t realise they had ADHD ✌🏼🕊
Cut up the onions and freeze them. You can use them in cooking anything.
I am ashamed of how I sometimes self-pity myself instead of actually trying to change anything about what isn’t going great. Wow thats the first time I actually said that.
I am personally ashamed that I still have no dream  job (not even as a child) /don’t know what to do with my life at all.
I am most ashamed of myself coz I can't keep myself motivated enough to lose weight and do things around the house.
Hey tax something that helps with my impulsiveness is I think about what I’m going to say and wait 3 seconds before I speak when it comes to buying things I think about if I actually need it. It’s not always effective but it helps a lot!
Just prep all the ingredients before you start and if you can, arrange them according to when you’re adding them.
The worst thing is that with 15 pounds i can only get 3 bottles of water in my country
I feel like burritos, stir fry, lasagna, paella, cottage pie, casserole, stew and pasta bake could be some other great options
When I meal prep I always choose one meal to be made in the oven, one on the stove, and one that doesn’t need to be cooked, or put in a crock pot so that they can all be cooking all at once without stressing out about the space on the stove
Can you film a morning routine??!
I'm ashamed that I can't keep friend's around
I've recently gone gluten free due to my IBS so would be interesting to see you do a gluten free challenge even for a day or so, it can be expensive but could make an interesting video 😊
She went over by 3p 😭😭😭😭
Is the step-by-step spinach and chickpea curry recipe on your British nutritional plan video?
onion soup
I'm ashamed I hold on to my depression because I don't know who I am without it. I want to get better but its like if I move on, I admit its gone and that makes it seem like it didn't happen.
Tips on multitasking: Don't  We ADHD people get distracted way too easily 😂
Hi Taz, I am trying meal prep at the moment, but I don't cook the entire meal like you did, but I also always opt for the easier meal options, like for salmon I will pan fry it cause it takes less time but I will prep the rice and cut the veggies for the stir fry on the weekend, also I will cook the chilli on the weekend but boil the pasta the same day it only takes 10 min. Basically anything that goes into the oven or takes more than 10 mins to whip up is done on the weekend. And the rest is cooked on the same day.
I have ADHD I’m 20 years old, however lots of the ideas surrounding ADHD is false…. You have to remember it’s not about putting attention to something it’s about hyperactivity too… and constantly wanting to do something and be something
I am ashamed in myself of my jealousy which leads to overthinking (as most stuff make me overthink), I am afraid of losing my two friends so if they’re meeting up with someone else I feel like I’m not important anymore and I get scared and it’s just so weird and dumb
Hey Taz, I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD since the age of 7, I’m now 23. If you have any questions or need any advice just give me a shout! I’d be more than happy to help :) xox
I have to ask, why don't you clip the mike on your colar?
I have ADHD and I manage cooking/meals times just by trial and error. My kitchen is organized in a way that makes sense to me but not to anyone else haha.  I keep a lot of basics around and when that focus kicks in I cook up a storm and freeze lots for later. I also only prep 3-4 servings of a meal because I can’t eat the same thing all week
I'm adhd too and I know exactly what your talking about at 10:00
Try vegan for a week..
Just eat the salmon meals first. Then chicken. Then everything else
OMG WE NEED VIDEOS WITH MOOOONNNNN!!!!! WE MISS HER SOO MUCHHHH !!!!H! 🌻
"Know that you matter" looks alot like "Are you living life full of colour?"...
you should’ve eaten zigua
My tip for impulsiveness is trying to pause and think about the consequences of my act, And here’s a tip for your porridge breakfast add a tablespoon of ground flaxseed for your daily Omega-3 intake, you can also add Nuts and Sunflower seeds/ Pumpkin seeds for the extra ✨Texture ✨ and flavor (Roast the seeds and nuts beforehand if they’re not roasted)
U can try recipes from other countries
ok so i rly dislike spinach and ive tried to make myself like it but it doesnt work its bearable w pasta but thats it,, but the chickpea spinach curry sounds good!! so will try it!!
Ashamed trait: I don't know how to be there for people and be a good friend
I'd love to see a dressing up as different aesthetic/tv show characters for a week.   ❤️❤️❤️
I am shame of the times that I caught myself wishing that I could change my body
I was also finally diagnosed with ADHD this year, The impulsiveness is all apart of the ADHD (you legit said it as I was typing) now you know you have adhd you get to learn the new you who Taz actually is because yes you are the same person but now you know and understand things on a level you never did
If you dont want very funky take a pan make it hot and put your cold meal on it and it will be better 👍
I stopped watching your videos and YouTube properly in a while. But I've clicked ffor taz (hehehe) and can't believe I've missed your little milestone in your journey. You seem soo much more you, less holding back, unashamed, confident, comfortable, proper inspiration like. Did you get your adhd diagnosis through private means I know it's so hard as an adult to get help through the nhs, my ex had adhd he's 25 and he doesn't really get any support for it. It sucks seeing him struggle with it. So proud of you xxx
Chop the onions up and freeze them, thenn it saves you a job later and you're not wasting anything.
Can you maybe do another video of creating no waste for a day/week....that was the video that got me introduced to your channel and I would love to see you do it again :)
I am ashamed of my laziness 😅
Mealplan ideas: thai curry with rice, pasta with creamy sauce with mushrooms and zucchetti in it, rice with broccoli and tofu and satay sauce, pasta salad with veggies, fajita filling (and then you just put it into the fajita when you wanna eat it), Pesto pasta, griz, Fried rice, soups, mashed potato with carots and peas, potatos with creamy spinach and an egg on top, couscous with veggies
About multitasking- u can put some things that need ⏲️ at the oven/rice cooker. Boiling or frying one thing and cutting next to the stove, so u r technically multitasking but not burning anything
I am ashamed about how I fail to just enjoy the moment... I really have to work at it & being present but I suck at it... means I am not enjoying my family or my achievements as much as I should... it affects my happiness.
taz has amazing eyebrows haha i wish mine looked like that
For peeling the boilled eegs make sure they are coled in cold water long enough before peeling them, it’s so much easier and they’ll be perfect 🥚😉
I really like your accent 🔥
Hey, I think that it is not really about meal prepping per se but meal optimisation. So for instance, if you want salmon then you can buy frozen salmon, and have it with potatoes and wilted frozen spinach and this is a dish that is really under twenty minutes to make. Also, eggs and potatoes (Rachel Roddy’s recipe drop the guardian is super good!) also. You have to leave it on the hob for twenty minutes but if you do something else like washing up in this time then it is great!
Dear Taz. You tried so hard to have £15 but sadly your total for lidle and Morrisons shop came to...  £15.03 I am very sorry to say that have a good day. love willow <3
Key to multitasking for first timers is planning and prepping before you turn on the stove. Figure out which ingredients take the longest to cook(rice, boil beans, boil water for pasta, etc) and cook the others that dont take long to cook while you the others are bubbling away.. 😊
I wish we had that wonky box here in the Philippines that will make my meal preps really affordable 🙂
Good afternoon Taz. Have you looked into the Briggs Myers tests ?, these ask loads of questions in order to assess your personality type, there are 16 of them. So i was diagnosed with a childhood attention disorder but  have since learned it is because i am an I.N.F.J. This really helped me to more effectively integrate with society these past 15 years. So bottom line is  " Don't medicate - Educate ". Love your channels.. cheers Barry W.  Wiltshire U.K.
you are awesome.. got addicted to ur videos 😍
I always love your videos Taz! A few minutes in and I ready can't stop smiling. Thank you for brightening up my day!
Chop the onions up and freeze them!!
Hey Taz!! loved the video! Im newly diagnosed too, still figurimg everything out, my best advice about it is get a psychologist for yourself, it is what has been helping me best, mine is there to keep me accountable every week, she lets me get steam off from what happened in the week, helps me and gives me advice on how to deal with my ADHD, and is all around really helpful in my life, as I also have anxiety. (  also sometimes its hard to find someone with your ideals, that gets you, never give up bc of that, you are worth finding someone that understands you and you have that right as a pacient) Anyways hope this helps you or someone else <3
I usually roast a big dish of vegetables in the oven on Sunday and use that as a base for a number of meals during the week. The roast veg an be added to sauce for pasta, into an omelette or a curry for example. I cook rice and pasta when I need it and just add the roast veg + sauce for the relevant dish I'm making. Because I don't fancy having cooked meat/ fish hanging around for longer than 2-3 days tops in my fridge I tend to eat veg based meals from about Wednesday for the rest of the week.  You could also do quick dishes like stir-fry in between things from the freezer to break it up.
I feel connected to you even more haha. I am 24 yrs and have Just recently got the adhd diagnosis aswell. It clears up so many things but is also a little sad. That was what I felt at least.
You should do vegan meal prep
What im ashamed of in myself is that i dont talk back and dont stand up for myself. Someone could be telling me all those bad things and i will either be sorry for them feeling this way about me or i'll be left speechless and dont know what to do. I'm not brave at all how can i fix this? i have 0 ideas. but i dont want to stay like this if anyone has any tips please help this poor friend
I'm ashamed of my trust issues. I know I can trust my friends but because of past experiences I cant trust them. I feel bad.
"This is my wonky veg❤️✨"  The bananas: 😢
Im ashamed of how I think.  One friend about one other friend of Mine: He is so nice and he really likes you That friend: I really like you My brain: He hates my guts
If I get a lot of money, I'll spoil myself to entire Taz's merch collection of that time💃💃💃. I just love you so much Taz 😍
I love how you are trying to take care of yourself, not only mentally but also physically. After all, an unhealthy body cannot sustain a healthy mind! I have a few tips for your meal prep (which took me years to figure out), so as to (hopefully) take some of the dread out of the equation.  1. Be careful with the freezer. I have found an article which explains how long you can freeze foods and in what state of cooking. The freezer is a great help but we must know how to use it.https://www.almanac.com/content/freezer-storage-times-how-long-can-you-freeze-foods  2. Instead of cooking four different meals and take up the whole day, why don't you cook one family meal and freeze the rest? For the first couple of weeks, you will have to cook every 2-3 days, but gradually you will have an assortment of foods in your freezer, so you could go more days without cooking. In this way, you will not be bored or frustrated.  3. As you showed in this video, you don't have to prepare the whole meal beforehand. Some things just taste better freshly out of the pot/pan. But there are other things that you could cook in large batches and keep in your freezer for whenever you want them. For instance, you could cook tomato sauce from overly ripe tomatoes and freeze it until you need a sauce for your meals (I always boil it with chopped onions, carrots, basil/parsley, whatever spices I have and, sometimes, even a little mince meat for extra flavour!).
I really like to make Lentil Bolognse. I just cook the Lentils in some Tomato sauce put some onions and sometimes other Veggies like Sweetcorn or Spinach in there and let it cook about 30min. You might need to add some water to it while its cooking. And I like to eat it over Pasta or fill up Wraps with it.
Oky i just found your channel and i’m in love!!
Here's a couple video ideas: -Eating a certain coloured food for a day (Like pink or green) -Eating your most hated foods for a day (This one would be so funny haha) -Letting your followers choose what you do and eat for a day. -I feel like you should try fasting for a week (Like the way us muslims do it), its really healthy but challenging and would actually make a great video. -Buying foods blindfolded? Maybe online food shopping or in public (Rly embarrassing haha) with some assistance of a friend ofc to make sure you dont break anything. Hope this helps xx
I'm ashamed of how I want everyone to like me. Whenever I meet someone I want them to love me so much so that I tweak my personality and opinions so they will like me more. I won't completely change my personality and opinions but I just make them more aligned with whoever I'm speaking to which means that I'm very rarely completely myself because I'm always trying to be what I think others want me to be
Hey Taz,  You can buy frozen salmon fillets from iceland (i’m sure other stores do as well) that only need a couple of minutes in the microwave. I’ve had them before and are really good for last minute cooks with noodles/rice! Love the video as usual with your openness and honesty 💕
I got Deliveroo Plus and I just do all my shopping on there from Aldis 😂. I dont like having to get my food from supermarkets.. takes too long
16:09 omg that pimple you have on your face I have a same one too and it's on the same spot 😂
Het Taz when tou heat up rice in the microwave tru putting a small glass of water to moist the rice.
why the heck is the door open when your eating? are you the overlord? are you not scared of demons creeping up on you? pls teach me master.
Tip for cutting onions get a wet paper towel and put it by the onion it goes to the nears water supply which is the paper towel & not your eyes !
I feel you so much! My ADHD means I spend €15,- a day at least on groceries… I am terrible
So I used to struggle with multi tasking and as a culinary student it helps to make a work plan, and break down your process into individual steps and alot the time you're going to spend on each of them, and you do all your prep in one go, all your frying/ baking stuff in one shot(I also like to colour code it)
While I was training in kitchen's I found doing different kinds of meals eg some that are baked some slow cooked some pan fried because then you can do pan fried meals back to back while slow cooked and baked foods are cooking also cooking proteins and carbs separately to vege can help
You should do like different ethnic foods for every week
Thank you so much for introducing me to the concept of wonky veg boxes!! As an avid cook who loves coming up with random veggie recipes by chucking loads of stuff together this will be a lifesaver. Can’t believe I didn’t know about them 😮
I don't know anything about pasta but isn't it better to cook the sauce only. Only cook the pasta the time you're going to eat it?
Add to ur  list for meal prep- Beef Cutlets, chicken & potato curry, lemon rice
UK I think is a budget paradise. Those discounted products sell very high price in my country.
If you use the big oven bags the ones you get for turkeys at christmas.you can put meat veg and spices in together and bake it in the oven.saves loads of time.
Overacting
I have the same rice cooker and it's awesome! I even made bread in it! :D
Please, could you show non-turistic places in London that are great or turistic places in London that you like? 😁
Taz your merch store doesn’t have option to select ship to Australia! 🇦🇺   I’m devastated 😭😭😭😭😭😭 I wanted that hoodie
Taz please do this every weeeek! I’d love to watch you meal prep and cook and shop and plan every week  your meals! I find it soooo motivating and relaxing and interesting and entertaining. And love the new merch even tho it won’t let me order
easy multitasking set timers with name for everything
Hey Taz, try next time to freeze the food after it gets cold, because if you freeze it while it's getting cold it will get a funky smell or taste. Maybe that's where the funkyness is coming from😊 in general whenever you wanna store food in the fridge or the freezer you should wait for it to reach at least room temp, because if you store it hot it will affect negatively the taste. Check also which foods you can and can't store in the freezer😊✌🏻
My favorite thing to do when I get bored of meals is making wraps/ burritos out of them. For example if you have leftover rice and chili, make a burrito with them and add some sauces and veggies and it tastes so much better.
please do a tutorial on how you manifested them onions 😣😔✊
I feel like this might be mentioned in comments, but here goes: Taz, please taste your food while you're cooking it. You'll be able to adjust spicing on the spot and you'll have tasty food the whole week :)
Multitasking isn’t good, one thing at a time!!,
I am sometimes ashamed of my impulsiveness also. Especially because I often overshare... tell people things they really didn't need to know or sharing my feelings so quickly. I also am a super emotional person and anyone can read my face. As soon as they ask about it I often just blur it out. It can be quite unhelpfull in a work environment :/
Soups are really good and easy to meal prep
Hey taz  Do you know the app KptnCook?? You get three meals a day and three extra on Monday… I found some amazing recipes on there that I cook so often… maybe that be something for you
Nice‼️👯‍♂️
you could try Sortedfood's app 'Meal Packs' :) it's not free of charge but I think there's a free trial month ;)
Invest in a small chest freezer so you have more food storage and you are less likely to get bored with the food choices, also the baked potatoes you make in other movies are bad idea, just add something different than beans, even chilli beans or Mexican loaded ones,  you could bake a batch and then just re-bake it when you want one with filling, and if you get sick of oatmeal, make bran muffins and add different fillings and just have one with glass of water or juice in morning
Edit: I saw there is a chef commenting something very similar below, but much better articulated  7:14 the best way I know to multiply task when making food is to plan ahead. - Decide what you are making ahead - if you notice that dishes prepare some ingredients the same way, make them together in a bigger batches and put the ingredients aside for when u make the other dish (like if you have multiple pasta dishes)  A good ingredient for this is potatoes. You can boil them in well salted whaler, then you can use them boiled or you can let them cool down and make pan fried cubes, potato boats, or usen them in already done soup.  Rice might be even better and diverse   Time and practice is your friend, and you don’t need to do every dish at once  (Usually i do the planning in my head, but I tend to mess it up if I haven’t made it before or are unsure of how I’m supposed to go forward (chooses can mess me up, if one is not clearly better). I might have the advantage that my brain is very systematic, and I like to plan every step)
You should try an Instapot. My mom cooks all her meals in it. Everything from meatloaf to lasagna. And boils her eggs in it and the shell's just fall off. And she makes chilli and it takes like 15 minutes from scratch. Would make it so you could cook more than one meal at a time.
I’m so happy for her ^^ getting the diagnosis. Doesn’t change anything, she is the same she have always been
Best tip for me was: cut everything. Measure everything. Aaand then start cooking.
im ashamed that i need a lot of explanations from people because im too concerned if they actually, really love me when they say so. i feel like i sound so needy and and self-serving for asking. :v
I don't understand why you said in 15:10 that you love all the food when literally your first meal was terrible...
You also have commitment
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh, im so happy you got evaluated. Im so happy for you. 😁😁😁😁👍🏻as a fellow person who has adhd, i welcome you to the club and community. Cant wait to see and hear your progress in getting the help you need and making your life a bit less stressful.  Good luck on your journey. 😁   Also if you read my comment, i suggest you go to a YouTube channel called How to ADHD, it will help you to understand ADHD a bit more since the host also has ADHD. 🙂 this is the channel where i learned about impostor syndrome and RSD or rejection sensitivity dysphoria. I feel better knowing the way i was feeling wasnt made up in my head. Lol
One thing I miss about living in England is the reduced food in stores… In Germany food is never reduced to that extend…
I have a high degree risk of having adhd too. And, I can relate to you so much. The worst thing is people around you think that you are just lazy and when you want to talk to them about it they just say that it is in your head.
Video idea: updating the wardrobes in your bedroom with removable wallpaper
Hiya👋🏾 To avoid the shells sticking to your eggs, boil your water first and then place your eggs in the water gently using a spoon to avoid cracked eggs.  Once done, cool with water and peel.  Soft boiled eggs: Boil 7-8 minutes Hard boiled eggs: Boil 10 minutes or more.
Hey there! You should wash and prep beforehand, so that everything goes smoothly when you get cooking! 💕
Taz: "I procrastinate. Especially when it comes to cooking."  Doc: "It's ADHD."
Hey taz you can make chicken biryani. Love from India...
video ideas - throw a dart on a map of london and go there, go to a cemetary and find the oldest person you can find and research them, raise money for those in need somehow, break a world record, do a reselling video for furniture, do a 24 hour challenge of some sort.
So proud of you for seeing a specialist and being diagnosed! That's brilliant, we love self growth 😍
Okay
I have ADHD and I feel everything ur saying
Thank you taz. You’ve now made me worried I might have adhd.
I will never wrap my head around how people can eat the same thing for a week
Bestie dw I’m very emotional and spontaneous soo dw I LOVE YOU THE WAY YOU ARE🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Nice, you seem stuck inside all day - how about a 10,000 step (of actual outside walking) challenge. Get some fresh air girl.
Hi taz.... How is your baby? Have not seen much of her lately... 🤗
What I am ashamed of in myself is that I stress myself out and blow things out of proportion. I need to work on calming myself down to prevent myself from being too anxious and handle stressful situations with a clear, calm mind instead of with a head full of the worst possible scenarios.
Girl, everything you said after reading the table talk card is literally ADHD related. The impulsivity, the saying what you think brutally honestly, etc. - it's aaaall intertwined haha   I've always felt SO connected to all your videos and I realize now it's because of how alike some of your actions and spontaneity/impulsivity are to my own. ADHD is no joke haha - I'm still learning more about it every day to be honest but I do have some tips for the impulsivity!  First, you gotta reflect on the situation you acted impulsively on - like really sit with it and consider how you could have reacted instead. Get in touch with yourself and try to determine WHY you reacted the way you did and plan out what you could do differently in the future. (i.e: if you make a snap decision about a purchase and end up not really using/enjoying the item, maybe try listing all future "for fun" purchases and sitting on them for 24-48 hours before hitting the buy button. I've definitely had to train myself to do this 😂)  Oh, also I highly suggest talking to a therapist if you're not already. I recommend finding one that's educated on the inner workings of ADHD and/or similar neurological disorders. It's really helpful to talk to someone that actually understands what you're talking about and knows how to help rather than just venting to anyone randomly. I know therapy can be super intimidating and stuff but try not to let it stop you from seeking help.  Also kinda piggy-backing off your answer of impulsiveness being what you're ashamed of but... saaaame. I take on projects and commit to deadlines and make snap decisions because I don't take the time and space to sit with these ideas and think them through. So I end up overwhelmed and stressed out and it causes me to perform poorly and spend the whole time stressing and overthinking when in all reality - if I'd just limited the amount of things I took on, I wouldn't be in the mess in the first place. I'm basically sabotaging myself daily 🙃😂
OMG YASS I CAN BUY MERCH NOW WITH APPLE PAY!
what im ashamed of myself is how when i need someone, i wont have the courage to reach out , and when im in a bad mood, ill distant myself from everyone and will come back when i feel better
You could just season the salmon/ any other meat and keep it in the freezer and just cook it up quickly like you did for the quinoa
Bro the oven and air fryer will be ur best friend while multi tasking ,, you can just put stuff in there and work on stuff on the stove while they cook
Hi taz, I just wanted to let you know that for better rice, you should wash your rice at least 3 times (unit the water is mostly clear) (agitate the rice in the pot of the rice cooker with water) and that in the fire, I recommend getting a zojirushi or tiger brander rice cooker. I have one of each and they have lasted so far, 20 + years in pristine condition. They also cook the rice better. You should check out some videos about the rice cookers and how to wash rice properly. (Also in my opinion, jasmine rice is the way to go) Lot of love 🥰
Great video.
Girl, look at Pinterest, there are SO many great recipes for meal prep.
Spectrum, not scale, that’s the word you were looking for 😊
I’m ashamed of my weight after I had my Baby. Baby is 5 month old and I’m still 20kg heavier then I was before I fell pregnant
Who did you see? Where can I go for a screening test
You might consider live streaming your meal prep - to make it more of a fun thing then a slog
Taz next time you make merch you should do a bowl for ramen noodles with your cute ramen sayings like “I got to do it for the ramen community” stuff like that
I love you tazz
The only thing do have be ashamed of is to do not be your really self ya know, as wierd as sound im proud of your attitude because admitting that you have sorta problem it is hard to say kinda liberating by saying it on youtube but with baby steps you can be a better version of youruself for your sake and thats awesome actually sometimes i dont know if im my really self or a version of what people want from me. confusing but true i try every day to be more myself and a better version too
Did Alfie days teach yall nothing
Chinese chicken and rice with your trusty chilli oil 🔥
There is a technique called "box breathing" that is quite good when you need to be calmer or get yourself into a more focused state of mind. It's simple, free, and there are instructions on a lot of wellness sites online. It can buy you a few minutes to reduce the adrenaline rush and choose your words or actions more carefully.
you stole demetrius harmon's you matter hoodie design
To help with the impulsiveness, I've heard that counting to five before saying what you want to say helps. It gives you a little buffer of time to think before you act. Even though it's hard to stick to when you're really heated, it helps with the small stuff.
For salmon and other fish you can use airfrier and get them ready in like 10-15 minutes so you can eat those fresh with your meal preps, you can even aifry chicken .
Stuff I add for meal prep: 1. Lasagna or Mosaka  2. if you don't want to make salmon in advance you can make tinfoil meals of it! I love putting salmon and a bunch of veg + some butter and spices in tinfoil and just throwing it into the oven! That way you can prep most of it in advance and just pop it in on the day  3. Try super easy pasta salads! I usually make mine with chicken, pasta, spinach, paprika and feta cheese (and then use the oil from the feta as the oil). I know you're not a huge fan of cheese, but simple pasta salads similar to that are great!  4. Making pizza with tortillas  5. One pot meals (for example in the rice cooker)  6. Make some meals where you make room for several variations. Like you can pick between several ingredients (think rice, pasta or potato for example). You're gonna end up with your least faves on the final day but overall it's good
OMG i think I have it too 🤣🤣🤣 😸 .. will look into it 😱🙄😢
Foods that have red dye like Hot Cheetos and Takis, have been linked to ADHD. That’s why when people eat Hot Cheetos in China they are orange because they ban the red food dye they use. Just an FYI.
How hard is to get a 1.50 pound lidl box?????? I have heard it's really difficult.
not to self diagnose but this video is making me realise that I might have adhd too. I've always thought it was a possibility but now it's making me realise it might be real real and I need to get tested
I’d love to see you do a another meal prep but try vegan recipes instead. It could be like a double challenge where you try going vegan for a week or two and see how you feel and how you’re body reacts as well as doing your budget meal prep🙌🏽
Where's Moon?
hi Taz you used to post a lot of poetry and videos about your depression? Could you make a video on how you overcame it to now doing so much fun stuff? You seem happier? Thank you
The rice cooker wire part was so funny! When me and my partner first moved out we got a washing machine and I cried because I thought they didn’t send the pipe (it had been a long day) turns out it was inside 😂😂😂🙈
Congratulations on finding one of the mythical £1.50 boxes! I managed to get one once, but have never found them since, no matter the time of day or day of the week I go in. They are highly sought after, it seems!
Bulk food ideas: Moroccan stew (apricots, chickpeas, sweet potato olives) Fajita mix  Lasagna Dhal  Mattar paneer (big curries) Katsu curry  (make the sauce and freeze it then I absolutely love putting turkey dinosaurs with it haha)
Potatoes are really cheap. You could get 4 baking potatoes for about 40p in Asda then you could precook them and have different toppings
so delicious
U can pay the  electro preacher cooker to help u with cooking many meals big love from Saudi arabia ❤❤❤❤
i have adhd and i didn’t even notice on you! but meal prep has saved my life! cause i was having takeaway 4/7 days or 3/7 days a week x
Just do 2 days of salmon and change the protein for the rest of the days. ☺ 💡
oh my goodness i miss these videos! used to watch these all the time !!
I'm ashamed of how much I self deprecate. I always put myself down or make fun of myself, before someone else gets the opportunity to do so. I want to make a conscious effort to change this, so that my son doesn't also learn this behaviour.
Owh do "Playing SIMS4" videos please please.
Im not even sure if Taz will see this but life hacksss: Place wet (as in wet wet) paper towel beside the chopping board when cooking onions and voila! No more tears 🤌🏼
you can't even buy a loaf of bread with 1.5 turkish liras in turkey and you get all of those vegetables and fruits for 1.5 pounds...
cut the onions up all at once and freeze them, saves those watery eyes every time
To answer the question,  I get ashamed when I don't talk about my feelings. I prefer to bottle everything up till it goes too far. But I am trying to talk more lately to people. Do you find it easier to talk to people?
Shabash 😍
another great video loved it...
Hey, just a tip. Red onions are used for salats. And yellow ones for cooking and sum
idk why i haven’t subscribed to taz yet, i’ve watched almost every video
Ok Taz, listen here your “ impulsiveness” is not ur fault and we all know that and anyone who thinks other wise can *bleep* off, and you shouldn’t be ashamed we love you so much❤️❤️❤️‍🔥
I really like these videos ❤️
I think you should try and do regular videos about meal prepping to keep you on track.  Things like menu planning budget videos and stuff like that
I feel like I want to answer the question.  What am i mostly ashamed of?  Well, my answer is very long. I am ashamed of my lack of confidence as well as my weakness. I am incapable of making my own decisions. I am always scared of the outcome and doubt my abilities. I am just a weak person who’s unable to either love ot have confidence in herself. I am just way too comfortable in my comfort zone from which I don’t want to exit although I need to. I am about to turn 19 and am still unsure about life. I want to change majors so badly and get into smth related to the medical field but as always I am afraid. I am scared to face my dad and tell him I hate everyday I spend at college, I am afraid to continue in my major bec my mental health is just going downhill although my grades are high. At the same time, I am unsure  about switching cause I might not be able to survive in the healthcare industry and again regret my decision.
Thing I'm ashamed of: having a bad relationship with my body. It's been so hard especially during quarantine. I've never admitted it to anyone.
Hi! Multitask cooking tip. You should check your recipes beforehand. Where you have to cook them and for how long. Try to use all your utensils at the same time. ( oven, stove, rice cooker, air fryer, keetle etc.) So for example you put veggies in the oven, while you cook the rice, and in the air fryer you can make chicken wings or something. And in the meantime you can use the stove for making soup. Just make sure to set alarms for everything. And if you feel overwhelmed just turn one of them off. Its better to have uncooked veggies than to go into a full blown panic attack and ruin the full dish (speaking from experience.... )
A good meal prep idea would be frozen spinach and brocklie with papricka himalayan salt and a littel lemon with cod fillets if wanted
There’s nothing good about saving money on food 🤮🤮 eat quality and organic.
What about hello fresh
Cooking in white clothing… just another brave thing about you 😂👏.
S I N G U L A R I T Y  A sound of something breaking I wake up from sleep a sound full of unfamiliarity try to cover my ears but can't go to sleep the pain in my throat gets worse try to cover it, I don't have a voice today I hear that sound again it's ringing again. That sound a crack again on this frozen lake I dumped myself into the lake I buried my voice for you over the winter lake I was thrown a thick ice that has formed in my dream I shortly went into my agonising phantom pain that is still the same have I lost myself or have I gained you? I suddenly run to the asks there's my face in it please out to cover the mouth but in the end. Spring will come someday the ice will melt and flow away tell me if my voice isn't real if I shouldn't have thrown myself away tell me if even this pain isn't real what I was 8upposed to do back then.
Fettuccini  Chinese Sushi Curry Spaghetti and meat balls Chicken wings  Rice and veggies  Tacos or a taco mix that u can add to tortilla bread
Ah shit she's me but much MUCH older
People were always mad that we'd comment that you either had ADHD or autism but hearing you say it was helpful is so reaffirming that we were trying to make your life easier. As a person with ADHD i never would have known without my neurodivergent friends telling me i have those tendencies
Your cooking vlogs are some of the funniest. When Taz is in the kitchen I just know somethings gonna stick, burn, not come out, get dropped or taste awful. :)
Love that you’re honest about how cooking doesn’t always turn out as expected. I feel that a lot.
Why don't you try making a big puzzle, or maybe those big painting puzzle thingies that come with colours, numbers and even the beaded ones! That could be a good video idea I think! 😁😁
For people with a little time or have trouble making dinner. You could also sterilaze certain things like (pasta) sauce, vegetables, fruits and more. It's really nice if you just have time to heat up 🙂
Maybe as a video idea you could do a blind taste test of foods you’ve never had before and try to guess what’s in them
I always try to clean while I am cooking, cuz it helps not to get overwhelmed by the huge amount of dishes. For mushrooms I use an egg slicer it's fast and really easy to cut in even slices. When there are multiple pans on the stove don't forget you can set the fires lower wich help with the time so not everything is ready at the same moment. Plan ahead and know what takes to most time, begin with this so you are not waiting around for things to get ready. Hope this could help. I love cooking and learning about food of all kinds of cultures. Don't forget to taste while you go. ☺️
You can do rice and beans?
I bake chicken and salmon and have them interchangeably. Also, I freeze sliced bread and defrost /toast it as needed.
I would love another vid of a week of meal prepping! I love every video u put out and I’m sure other people do as well <3 maybe u could start doing vlogs?
TAZ YOU NEED TO TRY AIRFRY CAULIFLOWER BUFFALO WINGS THEY’RE SO GOOD, veggie stir fry, noodles, sweet potato quesadillas, fried rice, sushi, burritos, taco filling (so all u have to do is get taco shells)
i got the prints and they are amazing!!
Check out the Downshiftology meal prep videos 😊 I've learnt so much from her. I think I have ADHD too 😅
Cooking 3 times a day is made out to be normal but I don't believe many people even do that. There is not enough time in a working day to want to do that every day
one thing I'm ashamed of in myself is how lazy I am. I tell myself I'm going to do all these things, but they fall through just as I start. It's so frustrating because it feels like I physical can't even make myself do tasks.
Taz - you can put the porridge oats in your new rice cooker and before cooking leave it over night with the peanut butter, bananas in a milk of your choice. I guarantee results!  Oats become super fluffy and easy to swallow - it's completely different.
just saying i 100% definitely recommend lentil bolognese
I am ashamed for failing my final exams for university twice and my parents spended too much money for me to help me succeed without complaining and I hate myself for that , I am now going to get my degree from university but I still think about it
Hi Taz I just wanted to say this video is a literal lifesaver! I have Autism ( which is on the same spectrum as ADHD) and I hate prepping food and meals because effort and stress haha. Your video has inspired to start food prepping 🥰 Thank you!
If I prep ahead salmon you can prepare any sauces etc, box and cool, add raw cubes salmon / fish on top then freeze. Fish will cook when you microwave…..no longer days old salmon 👍🏻
With Meal Prepping I found making a base like curry; red sauce etc which is the most time consuming as the prep, then portion whatever can be added to change flavours and textures later through the week seperate from them so I didn't feel like I was eating the same thing constantly was helpful
with the eggs, pretty pastel please did a japan 7/11 video i think and showed the way she always peels the boiled eggs
I personally burst like a Volcano when I am angry.. So I have been trying this.. When I am really really angry at something, I take a few deep breaths,close my eyes for a few seconds and clench my teeth.. Sounds weird but it works for me.😅  Hope this helps❤️ Lots of Love to you..🤗
Throw some soy sauce, salt, pepper and other flavours into the chilli when you reheat it. Just add flavour - cheese whatever x
So, do I have ADHD or do I just like to procrastinate stuff? Will find out later😅
giving onions to people is a valid love language
Hi what is the recipe for the spinach and chickpea curry looks yum wanting to try it
Taz why don't you just try basic dishes try lemon rice , Tomato rice and all you can make the curry part and just mix it with rice it's nice just google it it's tamil indian
Hey Taz instead of peeling the eggs and keeping it in the fridge for 3 days you should boil the eggs and not peel them until you are about to eat them so they don't expire ❤️
Whole day eating only meals with eggs? Maybe you can do a lot of experimenting new dishes around one ingredient for a whole day for every meal. That will broaden your dish ideas for meal time.
Make salan. You don't have to freeze it. Keep it aside and heat it up every 2 days (everyday in summer). Keep up to 5 days.
May I suggest meal prepping butter chicken? You're going to really like it, it tastes really good!!
A week of doing Yoga with Adriene would be so fun. I really think you'd enjoy it an that it could help with ADHD. 🤍
Taz don’t go changing anything that don’t need changing. But if it’s going to make you feel better, go for it.👍
That's not healthy at all, I can cook in 15 minutes for a single person and I eat fresh every time. Breakfast leftovers are ok till Lunch and lunch leftovers are ok till dinner. Dinner leftovers are okay for late-night hunger not even for breakfast. Prep work should be chopping, dicing, keeping ready all the ingredients you gonna need throughout the week. not cooking and storing them coz that's basically as good as leftovers.
her videos give me anxiety 😟
You could pre cut vegetables for stir-fries and freeze them. Take them out fry for a little and boil some noodles, add soy sauce and whatever else you like. Takes like 10 min when you have the veg pre chopped.  Also lasagna with vegan mince.  Bean and rice burritos work great frozen.  Also have burgers in your freezer and buns, also chips for a quick fakeaway.
you can try putting some chocolate protein powder into your porridge to make it less bland <3 or applesauce and cinnamon!
Taz this is 100% me. I often just not eat or eat some cookies. I'm studying abroad so i don't live with My husband now. He is pretty patient with my uncooking but like idk how long he can be patient with me haha...  But ah the struggle. Sorry for the story
Do cottage pie
Wash your rice until the water is clear  1 cup rice add 2 cups of water  Use cold water and bring to the boil and simmer  Nice rice 😚 also peel your eggs just when your going to eat them
Cooking tips: I cut everything first and then put everything in a priority list - with things that take the longest on top. I'd definetly only prep sauces and cook my pasta/grains always fresh or for two days max. Personally I don't meal prep but I like to prepare onions/veg and either freeze them or keep them in the fridge if I have a stressful week ahead. It allows for more variety in meals.  For some meal ideas that you can freeze: spaghetti with lentil-bolgnese, spicy pumpkin soup (great for cold weather) and dumplings. Of course you could buy the latter, but I like to personalise the filling. Also: most asian noodles take almost no time to cook - I usually eat them with some spring onions and marinated chicken or dumplings that I prepared before when I'm hungry and don't wanna cook for ages.
Prep for all dishes beforehand.. u can easily multitask. Cooker dishes first.. then gravy items. That works for me at least 😊
i know this mutlitasking hack doesnt really work on making food but it can help in daily life this is how i multitask: i prioritze the things i have to do 1-important and urgent  2-important but not urgent 3-urgent but not important 4-not urgent not important other tips -if you dont get it done will there be consequens you dont want= important and urgent  -can you give it to somenone else to be done later=(maybe) important not urgent  -will it distract you and waste your time= not important not urgent  credits to simplynailogical aka cristine for teaching me this tip (she mentioned this on her snapchat story some time ago) hope this helped :)))
hey taz, hope you see this comment. if you dont want onions to make you cry, dont cut the top (yknow like the little circle thing) until the last. Its what making it  bleed. Hope this helped have a good day :)))
Taz is trending!
Hey Taz, You can put the onions in the fridge 30 minutes before you need to use them that way your eyes won't sting when you chop them.  For multi tasking always start with something which will sit on the stove for a long time and won't need much supervision. While thats cooking you can do all your chopping, stir frying etc.
We used to make a weeks worth of easy meals for my grandpa to reheat and I now live alone so have had to get creative with leftovers. Here are my tips  If you are meal prepping: 1. Cut ALL THE THINGS FIRST. Idk why but it makes it feel like it takes less time to cook each meal if you have all the chopping down off the bat. 2. Start cooking “set and forget” things first. Like rice. Pop it in the cooker and it will be happy to wait for you after it’s done cooking. So you can focus on the food in the frying pan and not worry about the rice burning.  In terms of mixing up food, I like to make a meal that is able to be used in different ways. Example: taco meat. I can make tacos one night, nachos another, serve it with rice another day, or add it to a salad. So I’m only cooking one meal but serving it different to avoid being bored. Same thing works for lots of foods (meatballs. Have it as a sandwich, have it with pasta, have it with gravy and potato etc.).  Also don’t be afraid to have easy meals like things to make a fast sandwhich (you can even make a sandwich a few days early and just add condiments right before you eat)  That all has helped me a bit. But lately still isn’t helping so I started getting a mea kit delivered for 3 meals a week to spice it up a bit.
I love your food videos!
Such a  wholesome comments sections with people sharing tips and tricks to help others out. Lovely community right here
You can make quinoa in the rice cooker too in bulk and freeze it
Would love to see more of - 'reacting/ranking foods'  - challenges - more cooking videos for ppl who hate cooking (it's really just so relatable) - life hacks  - embarassing stories - could share some of your own and let subbies submt a bunch of hillarious ones.
Taz! You can try freezing sliced bananas. It’s sooo good
I would like to see you prepare your food weekly
Can you talk about the whole moving out process and what advice you would give for others looking to move out, love your vids taz ❤️
pickled onion would be a great idea.
Use youre air fryer next time like you can pre-prep meats by marinating some of it and fry them when you want using air fryer 😉😉😉 goodluck more of this please
How/where do you go to get ADD screening please?
girl is trending!
Idk why but i feel she was sad today…
Was wondering would it be possible to get the recipes that you made in this video please?? 🙏 I know you mentioned that some people have issues with eating healthily on a budget so it would be really helpful, not only to get a list of the items you bought, but also the recipes for the meals you made, especially the first one with the rice and chicken and vegetables. I feel like it would help so many people to be able to cook cheap meals if there's some sort of guide to follow. Thanks :)
Ok this video idea I have is very not the content you usually do but I really would love to see a gaming vid from u ik it's kinda weird but like you could play Minecraft Roblox or something btw you should prob play Roblox because first it's free and second the options are kind of endless so yh
👍-😷
If you are up to it,  you should try cooking every meal of a day for a week type video!  Cooking and having freshly made food is kinda therapeutic also!
Fish only takes 5 mins to panfry anyway- so you could do that fresh while your accompaniments are in the microwave. Other suggestions- shepherds pie or shepherdless pie made with red split lentils or beans. Vegetable and bean cobbler. Lasagne, soup, Chinese tofu stir fry with plenty of sauce to have with rice or noodles.
I just realise something. You look like camilla cabello 💜
Boiled eggs last longer in the fridge with the shell still on just an FYI and also just so you’re aware eggs uncooked should stay in the fridge as they last longer, also uncooked eggs last about two weeks longer than the date on the eggs if in the fridge.   Multitasking is easier with practice- chop up all ingredients for each meals at once then it’s easier as you can cook multiple things at once. For instance say four meals need onion, chop the amount of onion you’d need for four meal at once at separate in bowls so you know it’s ready for each meal.
A tip while meal preping is to use your stove and oven along with your cutting board simultaneously it helps you save time
I'm ashamed of how straightforward and bluntly truthful I'm. while that might sound like a good thing but sometimes, this behaviour comes off too rude to people. and ,say, when something wrong happens, and someone blames me , and I know it's not my fault. i WILL make sure to counter attack (?) and make sure they know it's not my mistake. but in this process I come off rude and after like 2 minutes, I know I was rude and I regret it all. working on myself...
Multitasking while ADD: I found I focus more when I make a list that I can check off as I go.  Plus the more comfortable you become in the kitchen the more you’ll understand the cooking times on items and what you can cook at the same time etc. I kinda I have the same issue except I love to cook but the dishes afterwards drive me crazy and my executive dysfunction hits hard 😅
Loved your videos. Just one observation from many videos, that is just typical Indian thing. Why so many rings in 1 hand fingers?.....Lol...that is so Indian thing like one is for that , 2nd is for that and 3rd is for that. For Indian, it is now an old thing. So FYI not even Indians are doing it...and top of it...it is not matching with your British accesnt.....lol......U might wana rethink on this....
Proud of you Taz 💕  ADHD is a pain in the butt (and that’s putting it lightly, ha ha); but I’m finding that now I know that there’s a reason why everything feels so hard, somehow it doesn’t make me feel so rubbish when I struggle to get sh!t done.  Have you found the ADHD side of TikTok yet? There’s some awesome people on there who have helped me a lot 😊🤩
I have adhd too. I know the pain of having it.
I watched fatherhood it was actually good
This might come too late, but if you have leftover onions again, you could chop them all up, portion them, and freeze them to use them later on. Would maybe save you some time and work the next time :)
Charity shop shopping!!
Eating nutritious for me means buying high quality groceries. I am aware that not everyone has the money for that but that’s not a place to try to save money. I always buy organic everything, only groceries that are non gmo and have no weird ingredients in it that I don’t know. Peanut butter is not even good for you with all those preservatives in it, but organic peanut butter that only has peanuts as an ingredient and it is way better for you.
You should do trying Trinidadian Food
Hello taz ,I've got a good  idea  about what to do about all of those containers  you have got stored😊( if it is a  number 6 plastic) (it will say on the bottom  of  the  container ) then you can make shrinky  dinks  out of them(you can write  some of your poetry  on them)  and make them into key chains  or other things  . It is really  cool  and fun ❤
About controlling your impulsiveness:  When I get angry or something makes me upset I also say whatever without thinking about it and think about what I said afterwards after the damage is done. It helps me to breath deeply as soon as I notice that I get angry, ask the person to stop talking, stop talking myself and just sit there quietly and slowly calm down and then think about the situation
Overripe bananas perfect for banana bread🥰
Me as a New Yorker watching this and thinking buying all this stuff in America would have costed MUCH MUCH more money
buy a pan divider. they can cook  several meals in 1 pan
This vid is trending yay
You did this vid before I think
Taz should make a video on her culture, I’ve always been curious about it
Maybe we could see more fashion videos? I love all the lewks you serve!
I think it would be great to have a series about behavioral therapy for ADHD. I read a book called “ taking charge of adult ADHD” and in it there are ways to help regulate ADHD symptoms. The things that we can change and the little habits we can build to have a better control over our lives. And by the way vegan food freezes better .
Ashamed trait, I am  worrier, I worry too much about the future and end up stressed and forget to enjoy the now. I am working on it by enjoying in the moment and telling my self that I am not stressing and whatever happens happens, but also not avoiding being proactive. Just because you are enjoying the now doesn't means you can't prepare  in a non stressful way
Your BTS army story !! 💜💜💜
Congratulations on getting a diagnosed 😊 I'm so happy for you. when I got diagnosed for severe schizophrenia it changed my life and now I'm in recovery
if you’d like a salmon dish that is good after five days in the fridge you could try making a salmon and spinach lasagna it tastes sublime
Get on a train to Paris or Brussels for a day! Super fast and you get amazing content.  For meal ideas, I honestly like cooking salmon and then making different variations. F.e. one day is salmon quiche, salmon with veg, salmon pasta, salmon... But you only have to bake it once, right. So maybe that's something you can think about
You need to give us the recipes honey😁
Other options for meal prep: spaghetti and meatballs or chicken balls Chicken alfredo pasta Butter chicken or butter paneer with rice Homemade pizza Fried rice Home made soup
Are you an Indian.
For me . AIRFRYER IS A BLESSING
Watch Kimono Mom on Youtube for ideas.
It's not an excuse, it's an explanation ❤️ Well said taz
try one pot or insta- pot recipes
Taz, you could...Do A Reaction Video......of a movie (say A Quiet Place Part II or The Conjouring) or music  video (say BTS's Butter)...or something else that you liked to watch.
Cooking multiple meals at once, for me, requires a very detailed plan. We created them in GCSE HE for doing our cooking exam, and so useful. You just work out with timings and stuff what is best to do when. Complicated I will say, but very useful.
i made 14 burritos last week to freeze! i made some sort of mix with 400 gr vegan mince, a zuchini, some tomatoes, 2 big bell peppers, and 2 glaces of really delicious bolognese pasta sauce with tofu. Corn and black beans. Lots of spices and then filled 14 whole wheat burrito's and packed them in tin foil and froze them. Now i reheat them for 25 min on 200* and its just the best lunch or dinner (or breakfast!!) My son heats them up with lots of cheese on top. Amazing. You can put anything in it and its so good.
How have I never noticed a wonky veg box before 😮 what a great idea!
Your clothing videos are fun! You could do a week dressed in different colours, so one day blue, one day pink, one day yellow (like you did with eating the coloured food!) you could accessorise and play with make up too 👌
Yay!! Great job!!theres frozen salmon packs u can buy where they are already sorted into small portions? Pulled pork is a good one because it freezes well and u can have it on buns, wraps, pasta , on fries. Its very versatile
Maybe you could eat only from olio for 24 hours?
I’d love to see a “Hidden Gems of the City” type video like showing fun lil places in different cities people mightn’t know about that they should check out! Whether it be a shop, a cafe, a restaurant or just a little garden or place to take pictures!! I think it could be really fun!
No no taz remember not to freeze food like this for more than 2-3days as it is very bad for your health it is ok to freeze vegetables but not cooked meet my mum is a nutritionist and this is her number one rule as there are very high risks of disease so try to avoid it thanks 😊 💕
you can cook the qinoa in the rice cooker. That one has a program for it. This rice cooker is really nice :)
About the question "how to multitask in cooking", well, you might have to learn it the hard way. I was too lazy to follow directions from youtube videos... you just have to experiment with the foodgroups? uh, dunno if it is the right way to say xD But just try to multitask when cooking things you already know. You will slowly get the feels for it ^^ I got a big freezer for myself, and I think I only cook once a week for real xD because I stuffed my freezer :x Unless we talk about a "avg" dutch for  "potatoes, meat, vegie" Then I just throw everything in a skillet till everything is done, because I prep my potatoes in the oven before freezing them :x
Congrats on getting your ADHD diagnosis confirmed. Hopefully you'll be able to find ways to make your life easier now.
perhaps you can make travel videos again if covid allows it!
You should do meal preps for each type of food, eg traditional British, Chinese, German, Spanish etc
Ok mr Olympia
for some reason when taz said she's impulsive i had to check out her birth chart. I dont think its fully accurate since i dont have her birth time but WOW. its funny how she says she thinks shes impulsive, and then has an aries moon. her sun conjucts jupiter making her very lucky. lowkey jealous of that. i wonder if taz is into astrology.
Hi Taz! I like your effort at mel prep, I used to meal prep a lot when I was in college until last year, and got a little experience at it so I will give you a tip. So you dont get bored of the same dishes, maybe try to prepare the ingredientes and mix them in different dishes, example: when you Cook the chicken, instead of using all to put in the rice, Cook a little bit More if needed and them separate it in three part, use one part to make maybe two portions of your mix rice, the other use to mix with pasta and some white sauce and the rest keep plain and do yourself a taco with a Tortilla and some lettuce another day or make yourself a sandwich with a bagel and some cheese, if you make ground beef for a bolognese left some ground beef apartan maybe combine it with a bake potato and sour cream, if you Cook beans, them mix with some of the ground beef for Chili and left some apart for the tacos. Anyways you get the idea, you just have to tink of the ingredientes that repeat themself on the dishes you like and thats how you start meal planning. Good luck!
Taz can u make your intros not soo long ? Keep it short and sweet
i just started doing meal prep last week. i only make lunches. the other meals are same every day, coffee and sandwitch in the morning and ceareal at night.
Congrats on your diagnosis Taz. I’m so happy for you and I hope you can get the help you need to have a happy life. There is a Channel called how to adhd. Maybe you would find it helpful?
I was just thinking about when taz will post cuz I missed her and her vids and she posted and I am beyond happy! ❤️  Also you did a great job honestly, much more better than I could do. And the amount of onions you got 😭😂
Sorry I’m late Taz but u made it on trending!! I’m ashamed of how much I cry and how much I procrastinate. Anyways, I’m so proud of u!! (on merch, on videos, on cooking and making us smile)! 🥺☺️🖤👏
Taz: buys a rice cooker Uncle Roger: vewy pwoud
I think if you are doing a big meal prep what helps is doing similar tasks all at once. I don't meal prep too much, but I sometimes make up big dinner parties or I'll do the lion's share of the family Christmas cooking because I enjoy it the most (not a lot people in my family like cooking, except for my mother's girlfriend).   For example if you have to bake a lot of things, and it's around the same temperature, just put them all in at the same time and set an alarm each time you have to take something out.   If you have to chop vegetables, don't do it recipe by recipe. Just chop all the vegetables first at once before you start cooking.   If you have to stir sauces or stews for a long time on the stove have them all going and rotate between stirring them.   It sounds like a lot but from past experience this has turned me from spending an entire day in the kitchen for christmas to just spending 2-4 hours on all the dishes I make.   It also helps to make a game plan on your phone or a notepad mapping out all the tasks and doing a step by step list.
When I used to meal prep while in college, I would cook everything separately so I could mix and match.   I’d cook up a few different starches for example : baby potatoes, rice, quinoa. I’d also cook a few different meats for example: chicken breasts, ground/minced beef,  ground/minced turkey. Lastly I’d cook up veg such as broccoli, green beans, carrots, (whatever you like).   Each day I could mix & match and create a new meal so I didn’t get tired of eating anything. All you have to do is add sauce or gravy when heating up your food.   Here are some examples of dinners you could put together with what I’ve listed:  •”roast” chicken dinner with potatoes, veg and gravy.  • chili con carne (add a tin of mixed beans when heating) with rice.  • meat sung (use turkey mince and add nuts, seasoning and put it in lettuce cups).  •chicken, green beans and rice with a honey lemon sauce.   There’s so many options.
i have adhd and autism and my psychiatrist gave me a tip to control my impulsive reactions. she said that i can put notes on the walls that said “take a minute before you react” or “is this reaction going to hurt someone’s feelings?”.
im most ashamed of my inability to prioritize stuff and work on stuff that is actually important. I have executive dysfunction, and like taz, im not saying it's an excuse for my behaviour, just an explanation of it. I have so many things to do but i'd rather just do insignificant tasks to give myself a false sense of productivity.
Hey Taz. Good video. Nice to see you doing well.  You asked for meal prep ideas. I'd try beef stew, stuffed peppers (traditional ly they're stuffed with ground beef and rice with tomato sauce but quinoa or brown rice  with aromatics, nuts or lentils or beans works); lasagna freezes well; shepherds pie, and a layered meat or veg and potato curry or scalloped potatoes dish would work, also maybe pasta car obara, pakora.
I honestly think you are an INFP personality type. I hope you don't take meds for ADHD. Everyone loves you just as you are.
Did she just say “365 years”
i didnt see the ricecooker on prime day. damn  7:28 make a plan (i know, duh) start with things that take the longest like roasting veggies in the oven or start making parts of dishes where it doesnt matter if the sit around for an hour or 2 . or dishes where it doesnt matter how long they cook, like a bolognese sauce. you can cook that shit for 24 hours and it only gets better. OR  take my approach, make everything seperate. finish the meals one after another , put on music and enjoy the cooking. just hype yourself up 16:16  other idea . maybe make more of one dish so it could potentially last longer that a week and you just cook 1 meal a day . but this one meal is just a big ass portion. so you dont have to cook 12 hours on 1 day but rather 1 hour a day  but i dont know how your freezer storage situation is and if you have the room for that idea :) short edit for the end if you want to freeze salmon just make sure it wasnt previously frozen.  read the labels really carefully and even if you buy it from a fishstore ( i dont know the english name ) ASK if it was frozen for transport.  otherwise just buy the portioned frozen salmon filets and throw em in the ricecooker to steam
Hey Taz. Wash the rice. Please?
Try Julia Pacheco channel she has amazing food idea for on a budget please check her out xxxx
For multi tasking for example if your making pasta you can put the pasta in to cook first and then you can make the sauce while the pasta is cooking so that way the pasta will be done by the time the sauce is done and then you can just mix it together easy
I was waiting for your video. good to see you and I am glad to know that you are getting all the help that you need. good luck. lots of love. take care of yourself <3
could you please do another "returned pallet" video? I really enjoyed that one and loved seeing you use some of the items after
you could make Lasagna, other curries, fried rice, stirfry, stew of some sort?
Hey, Taz! Maybe you could consider doing DIY skin/body/hair care for a week? That would be very interesting 😍
Traybake dinners are good for multitasking when cooking other meals on the hob! X
A good option for fish is to make some sort of fish pies. Those can be left in the fridge or even frozen and last for quite a few days. In Spain there is a very popular recipe for fish pies. They are Cornish pastries shape and size, filled up with a mixture of thick tomato sauce, tuna and boiled egg, and deep fried or baked (I recommend baked). The dough is made with 300 g flour, 30 mL olive oil, 150 mL boiling water and a pinch of salt. No flour raising agents at all! You can substitute tuna for salmon easily. I hope you enjoy them!
Congratulations on you diagnosis! I hope it will help you a lot sis. It has helped me stop judging myself so harshly and in that sense made my life much better.
Am i the only one who wants Taz to eat the most expensive food for 24 hours
Hey Taz! Great video as always :)  To help with your meal prep and planning I have 2 main tips: - I love getting meal ideas on Pinterest, there are also some posts where they give you like 30 or 50 different meal ideas. So, you can go ahead and make yourself a pin board and use ideas from there. - Also, I recently found a website/app/browser extension called Whisk. It basically lets you save recipes, makes a shopping list for you and also lets you plan your meals for the week. I find it great. You can save recipes from external websites or you can use their integrated recipes as well.  I hope this helps! <3  Love from Bulgaria
Love that supermarkets do these wonky vegetable boxes over there, they just started selling these here in Austria and I love it! :)
I need taz in my life to budget my spending !
Try a day or 3 of only turkish food 😍😍 idea for filming 🥰 love you 🥰🥰
i want to see arts and crafts videos with guests :)
I hope you made this into a series! Idk why, but the idea of you just meal prepping foods and enjoying them is so fun to watch. Plus making videos of it might be a way to do it constantly.
I love that you have a Reishunger ricecooker:) proud German noices;)
Video ideas: .learn an instrument in a week .learn a language in a week .do something special for someone a week .do voluntary work for a week .selfmade presents for a week .plan a summer bucket list and do it .try different hairstyle for a week  Feel free to add this list with your comments guys!
Just take your time, the more you think of it the more that you'll be stressed out. Just do what you can at a time :)
Taz honey, see if you can get diagnosed for borderline personality disorder. My sister is diagnosed with it and add and she had all the signs you said about your impulsiveness so try getting it checked
hey Taz, regarding the planning side of meal prepping... have you heard about workweeklunkch? it's a customizable online tool with grocery lists for your shopping, you can save your favorites, etc etc <3
I might do this. Meal prep food.
Slow cooker! You just dump stuff in and stir leave it for 5 hrs then eat. Also p.s Taz please taste as you cook 🥲
Hey Taz, I was just curious how you make porridge because I wanted to try it the way you make it.
I missed you girlie
I am ashamed that I am too rigid in my life. I hold back on spontaneous opportunities because its not part of my routine
I think I’m most ashamed of how “lazy” i am. But when I say lazy I don’t mean I don’t do anything it’s not that, I mean when I start things like a new drawing or painting and then I get bored halfway through and don’t finish it. It’s quite annoying.
Try living a week on frozen meals from the supermarket
If your still figuring taz out, im jealous of u
One thing that has really helped me control impulsiveness is after reading a book on Buddhism.
When you cut onion, open your windows and the fan thing for the stove. Onion leave gaz so you should ventilate as much as you can.
Do you poke the eggs before cooking them?
I’m ashamed of the fact that I’m in my thirties and still feel like I’m pretending to be an adult. Like I’m only performing for others but I still don’t feel it and probably never will?!? Love from Germany 😘
R u only doing YouTube videos or u r also continuing law?
Also - I'd love to see you try; Positive Affirmations (or other assorted mental health 'tips') a BASIC fitness thing - like 30 days of exercising 10 minutes a day or 10k steps a day Trying a new art class or skill or something (watercolor, sculpting, heck, even cooking) Trying out tips to deal with ADHD symptoms (I use multiple alarms throughout the day to help me keep track of time and 1000 and 1 post it notes to help with object / task permanence)
Meal prep with always the same dish won’t work long term. You need to use things you can assemble different ways. There is a video about that : https://youtu.be/JCbDYulk28U
I don't know if someone has already said this or not.  When I meal prep, I cook my rice/pasta/quinoa and put into separate containers and freeze them. Then I can make different toppings, bolognaise/chilli/curry etc and then I can mix and match. Also Fried rice is awesome, meal on its own or a great side dish/base.
ADHD in the kitchen is difficult to manage.  It helps if you write things out ahead of time, cause they you can sort of start the stuff that takes ages, know that you don't need to worry about it, and just not stress as much when you are doing the rest.  Filming at the same time DOES complicate things.  VoiceOver and time lapse help with that (less thinking about talking to the camera).    Also, doing LESS at once helps.  Like, do 2 recipes at a time and then just do it twice a week instead of once a week.  Or like Cook 3 times a week and just make bigger portions so you can freeze some.  That way you aren't stuck eating the same stuff for a week straight, but it's still less stress and easier to meal prep.  Check out 'How to ADHD'.  Her channel has been an absolute LIFE saver in helping me deal with my time blindness and executive dysregulation.  lots of useful stuff there <3
I would love to see a makeover challenge. Let your cousins or friends pick out your new hair style, wardrobe and shoes and accessories. Total makeover would be amazing 🥰😘😍😍😍😍
does anyone know where taz got her football shirt? i love it!
Please do a vlog of your daily life! Just very simple and chill.
Me when I see the Bolognese pasta : It's not a clickfortaz vid without pasta!!
For someone who just started cooking, Taz you should consider getting instantpot! Its an absolute blessing in disguise!! You won't regret it...reduces the amount of time you spend in the kitchen over the stove as well as make things in bulk
Hey Taz of pure awesomeness… Check out the ‘how to ADHD’ channel on the YouTubes, it’s great.
Maybe try cooking one pot meals ? That way you're not only saving pots and pans but it'll be easier to cook more meals at once😊
well next  you can make lasagna  pizza and stuffed peppers
Did Taz not wash her rice 😮
Stir fry is delicious!!
Hey Taz!❤️ Can u pls share the recepies of all meals u made?
Baking with moon
she's so incredibly relatable like, she's almost like a big sister-friend figure to me. i saw the video caption and went like, "not taz doing meal prep again, she said she was sick of eating the same food for a week lol"
Please can you try to do a bento box making video pleaseeeeee 🥺
taz is my inner being
U r indian??
This is how I do all my cooking hehe. I love cooking but I can't be doing it from scratch every day, that's exhausting! So Fri or Sun I put in several hours for meal prep. The challenge for myself lately has been meal prep during a heatwave (36C 😭). I did stuff like quinoa rainbow salad -quinoa cooks in 15min & rest is raw veg, egg salad sandwiches -boiling eggs is fast, hummus -zero need for stove/oven, big batch of chili in the slow cooker & served as "haystacks" (look it up, it's an Adventist meal I grew up eating)
Taz if you don't wash your rice please wash your rice.
Potato curry with cous cous is my favorite
When u said cracking job while showing the eggs, it was impossible not to laugh 😂
What I'm ashamed of in myself is that I can't stand up for myself when I get bullied at school
You should do a fab lasagna; one big one and portioned  😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁💕💕💕💕💕💕
buy a slow cooker it might take a while but it cooks while you can make a different meal also, you can make almost anything in a slow cooker and you can put food on in the morning and leave the house go out and spend a day somewhere and then come home and the food will be ready
im ashamed of doing and saying things that I know will cause me immense guilt and remorse.  And also not being able to control myself.
to control my impulsive behaviour, like for example pet peeves, irritation, anger is to just take a breath, inhale and exhale, process your thoughts and act accordingly then :))
You could peel and chop up the onions and bananas and then have them for later on!
UK food prices make me want to cry in Australian.
For having multiple meals on the go, there might be a bit of a learning curve, but start with the things that will take longer to cook (like soups, rice, chili, etc.) and finish up with the least time involved (salads, etc.).  You can also break this down to a single dish too, like if you want a toasted sandwich, you could toast the bread while you prepare the toppings/things you're putting in your sandwich.  Best of luck! You've got this! 😊
i literally screamed once i saw taz has a new upload huhu❤️
...
And also heating might make dishes lose some nutrients 😓
A vid idea surviving in like a different country for 24 hours on like $10 or something
i love this video like usual 💜
Try to do what you wanted to be in your childhood 😊
I 100% reccomemd the meal prep king and pinch of nom cookbooks to help with meal prepping xxx
I regularly live on a budget as a single parent and my youngest 2 have a food allergy that makes it difficult to do
My favorite website for meal prep / meal inspirations is Skinnytaste.com  (Not an ad) but this creator knows what is what.  Hope this helps,  I just love your videos Taz!
tip for peeling the boiled eggs: put them in a cup with a spoon of water, close it with your hand and shake shake it for a bit
A quick tip I can suggest for meal prep is to consider prepping ingredients/components for later assembly, rather than fully made meals. It's a simple way to help with variety, because you can mix and match the components. And you can make things more interesting by changing up spices, sauces, etc. Like if you roast squash on a baking tray, coat one half in smokey savoury spices like paprika and chipotle, and the other half in cinnamon and butter.  Another tip to keep the flavours more interesting is to bulk prep "aromatics"/flavourful ingredients then freeze them. Lemon juice, caramelized onions, stock, chopped ginger, etc. Like with your millions of onions, you can chop them and caramelize them then freeze into small portions (you can use an ice cube tray or just portion into lil containers) then add one portion to a meal your cooking too add a ton of flavour without the effort. And you can take the same meal but change up the flavours by using a different prepped aromatic.
Can you get Grace to come over and do a meal prep day with you?
Invest in electrical steamer/steamer. It looks like a rice cooker, however, it can cook absolutely everything. And you just throw in the food and spices mix it up close the lid, set the timer and walk away. And done.
What I do is make a bigger amount of one meal at a go. Such as spaghetti Bolognese, cottage pie, and chicken stew. So end of the day you cook 2 to 3 days one week a month, and after you let the food cool down for about an hour then you put everything in the freezer. (Food can be frozen for three months at a time.) This is only for dinner meals. Try doing "snack" foods for lunch. Like a bowl of fruit, a hand full of nuts, a grilled cheese sandwich, some crisps or crackers etc. Make it easy for you to just grab and go, it will definitely help your ADHD.
Did she wash the rice? Asking for a friend
omg you sound like noddy
"Trying dresses from different countries! " Would be such a cool video.
Try some dishes like Biryani Pancakes Malai tikka  Fried rice  Banana bread Cheese toast This is all I've got😅 I would really like you to try maggi noodles it's an indian brand of noodles .
If you want easy nutritionally dense meals try looking up Abby Sharp's stuff. She's mostly plant based focused in her day to day life as well (as much as she can be with digestive issues)
TAZZZ you should buy a depop mystery bundle and do a vid on that!! I love watching those and I think you’d have fun!!
You should try chicken pad thai it is good and easy
I m 18 nd i mma move out in a year nd i feel like i m gonna be the same
Maybe so you don't get overwhelmed with new stuff, add one new dish each week for a month. By then you should 12 to 15 recipes and you can weed out the ones that you don't like and have a rotation of stuff you do. And you can think about seasonal produce to use for some variety during the year.
I'm curious by what you mean when you say something frozen tastes funky. Normally, if everything is fresh when you cook it and freeze it right away, there's no spoilage in the freezer. It's not going to go bad in there. The only thing might be freezer burn but it would have to be in the freezer for a long time to get that. And it's usually met that gets tough or rubbery.
How about, Daal…. Mixed veggies rice…… rolls…… tomato curry with chicken… fried fish… fish curry (you can add prawns later) …. Grilled chicken and fish….. lasagne….
I need 1pound weeks, im addicted to your videos about that. I watched all of them
You can try a baking video where u make bento box mini cakes
idk if It works for everyone but when I cut onions I bite a toothpick Just like in between my front teeth and somehow I don't cry but make sure you wash your hands and clean up like right after
You know what I am planning to have an online consultation today because I suspect that I also have ADHD. Watching this makes me more sure now.  I have been struggling for years mentally. I feel so slow in my life. Hopefully, my consultation goes well.
That wonky bin is really awesome and wish they did here.
Julia Pacheco on YouTube does quick and easy meal suggestions - each video has 4 or 5 recipes and she has a ton. You could also try a "only local" type video where you only use foods from within a certain distance. That's usually a little more expensive and can be difficult if you live somewhere without a lot of farms nearby.
Taz, I think an important aspect of meal prep to remember is that you don't have to prep everything so that it's ready to eat straight away. The quinoa you cooked up with the chickpea and spinach curry is an excellent example of this. The salmon you want to do could be another - since it doesn't take much time to cook salmon, don't cook that ahead of time. Instead, plan out the things you might want to eat with that salmon and prep those instead.  On the prep days, you should try to do the steps of a meal that are the most time-consuming. Generally this means prepping your veggies - peeling, chopping, blanching, etc. Just be mindful that some things do not store well in the freezer, and some things only store well in some forms but not others (e.g. raw potatoes are generally fine, but boiled don't tend to do well. Leafy greens or tomatoes don't store well due to water content if you want to eat them raw, but if you're planning to stew or puree them anyways they are completely fine to freeze).  Other things to consider are slow-cooked meals like chili, bean or lentil dishes, soups, certain sauces, etc. Speaking of sauces, those are also a great thing to prep. It depends on the sauce, but generally they are easy to make in bulk, easy to store, and have a variety of applications. Things like pickles are also easy to make at home and can be used as condiments, side dishes, or ingredients in their own right. I really like pickled onions and carrots with richer meals, personally
you got this taz
Onion store very well, Taz. If you chop them up and freeze them in ziplocs, they'll last months
Taz, do you have an InstaPot? If you don't, that would be another very useful addition to your kitchen
Taz without pasta... Never.... Impossible...
SOOOOOO proud of you for getting help and seeking out information on the neurodivergent front.   I would also recommend looking into ASD (autism). Females present so differently compared to male stereotypes. You might decide its not you, but the joy of the "Spectrum" means you can really fall anywhere on it in terms of traits.   BUT anyway, CONGRATS! its so great finding out why you do things haha not just lazy.. or antisocial.. but unique <3
Hey Taz, quick tip for cutting onions, try chewing bubble gum while your cutting them. Really helps!!  The wife and I love the content!
I know this might sound a bit out of your comfort zone but maybe if you try going out on a date .
Multi - Taz……get it 😂😅
Maybe you can make a video about things you like such as music or tv shows/movies
My weekly dose of Taz💚
A film idea is try cooking a few American dishes or swap diets with a friend for 24 hours.
I also have ADHD. The trait I hate about myself is my procrastination.
Hey Taz, If you add Baking Soda into the boiling water with the eggs it makes the shells peel so much easier! Also always peel cold (unless you're eating them right away) and I also suggest peeling them the day you're eating them and not in advance.
im ashamed of how selfish i am in terms of my emotions, i can never put someone's feelings before mine, i feel SO guilty when i do that, but i always put my comfort first ig? idk.
I used to work in a grocery store and me and other co-workers would constantly ask if there was anything we could do with “damaged” items or items that were perfectly suitable to be sold but they would just end up tossing because they couldn’t be bothered with the hassle of bringing it to food drives or pantries. Super stoked to see you have a wonky fruit box and wish my area would consider doing something of the sorts to reduce food waste!
Hi Taz I have a recommendation for you you should react to different k pop music. Love you
Hey Taz, I love your videos and have a suggestion where you can try and make food from different countries as your meal prep like Indian, American, Mexican, Italian maybe😁 Would be looking forward to your next videos Love from India ❤❤❤
I’d be interested in a day in the life video or something like that
Hi, I would love to see a challenge Taz  section in your videos you can ask your subscribers for challenges explain your parameters say to push you out of your comfort zone ect but not ones that put you in physical danger to much. I think you would get some good ideas/content from this and hopefully not to many bad/impossible ones. All my best wishes to you.
It would be amazing if Taz made weekly uploads showing us her making her meals for that week, it will encourage her to cook and will help others who struggle to cook 💛

Tips!  Never meal prep a recipe you've never had before, try and only use tried and true recipes that you've made and tinkered with to make them to your liking.  Prep all your uncooked food first at one time.  Don't do one meal and then the next and so on, cut everything in one go and have it all separated out in to little groupings of each recipe you're going to cook.   That way you can cook one or more meals at the same time (if you've got enough pots).  This also goes for crossing over ingredients.  That way you make one pot of rice and it'll go with two different types of meals (etc).  Onions freeze well so you can chop up the extras and freeze them in a container.  Now you've got chopped onions any time you need.  Meal prep can also be just putting together the ingredients, freezing and cooking the day of if that helps at all.  That way you get a 'fresh meal' every time rather than a precooked one.  (ie for teriyaki chicken and veg: cut up chicken, toss in the veg you want raw, add in marinating/cooking sauce in to a container or zip bag and then portion out the rice and put it in another zip bag and label.  Freeze the former and set aside the uncooked rice and then on the day of just pull out the frozen in the morning and thaw and by dinner you just have to quickly cook it up and you've got a fresh meal.  You can do it Taz!
What if you go on a virtual date and we watch??? Who knows, maybe you meet your soulmate...😁
When I freeze a chilli meal, after reheating I add a bit of salt. Salt makes it more eatable.
I'm ashamed of my impulsive anger. It takes over when I feel someone intentionally wanted to offend or upset me and it's awful. It's like a 0 to 200 in a split second and sometimes I can't stop myself from reacting in that moment. If I try to suppress it, I spiral and I feel like I need to react to the thing that triggered it and anything else the whole day after in anger. I want the ability to stop and pause and not be so trigger happy. Something I've been aware of but lost on how to fix.   PS: I've been on a trend of making soups. Cut veg (like carrot, celery, garlic) in smaller pieces, roasting in the oven, boiling in chicken broth, and then blending it together. Have bread on the side and I'm set for my meal. It's a way to get veggies in my stomach and I don't have to fuss much.
OMG! WE NEED A BLOOPERS VIDEO! 😂
I used to do 2 or 3 recipes/week, then freeze 1/2 of them. Then different recipes the next week, freeze 1/2,  then start rotating,  so you always have different options throughout the week & gives you a little variety. It was always nice to have those in the freezer for busy days!
Add some cinnamon to this porridge
Thanks to Taz that she made me question what is going on with me, and according to tests I have a strong indication of ADHD and severe Anxiety. WOW!!! Am I surprised? Naah.   I'll try my best and see that after moving out I get professional help.
Make the spiced chicken and rice and you can have it in wraps like a burrito so it’s kind of different (can add guacamole or any other things you like)
okay, so here I go again with watching his video on repeat till your next one comes out.
Cook room temperature eggs in air fryer for 15 minutes at 270F (132C). Place in a cold water bath and they will peel perfectly.
A new recipe you could try, if you would like, is a pasta that I made when I was running low on groceries lol and ended up being really delicious. First you sauté onion, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms and basil then add in a shrimp scampi seasoning packet along with butter (or olive oil) and a little pasta water and serve it with linguine (or any pasta or grain you have). Add Parmesan if you want. My favorite scampi seasoning mix is by McCormick but I’m sure any brand will do. I don’t really have set measurements because I made this using whatever Veg I had and this combo worked for me. You could certainly use any veg or protein. I doubt Taz or anyone will actually use this recipe but I’m happy to share it. I’ve been in recovery for anorexia for a little while and I’ve been learning to love food and cooking so my recipes probably aren’t that great.  Also, Taz, I’m so glad that you are getting help. I know a lot of times being diagnosed later on can be hard, I’m speaking from personal experience because I was diagnosed with Autism at age 23. Sending you so much love and positivity.
A pinch of salt in the Oatmeal makes all the difference just not too much obv.
Im in quarantine, my brother got covid and honestly u just make me happy taz thank you. X
If you learn to make Katsu sauce, you can freeze it and just buy breaded chicken steaks; whack the chicken in the oven on the day, use the rice cooker to make some quick rice and combine with katsu sauce. Really easy, simpler than you'd think, super scrumptious, and not 100% bad for you :)
If you do meal prep in the future with pastas, try to separate the pasta from the sauce
hey why dont you try doing pottery of a video
Butter chicken, fish and chips, Blueberry muffins and baked sweet potatoes
Literally,  best merch ever
You can get the Maesri Thai curry paste (I like the green one), add coconut milk, and mix it with whatever veg or meat you want! All the spices are already there.  I also like baking things because you can do other things (like clean up) while it cooks You can also do a miso salmon. Mix a couple tablespoons of miso, a little honey, a bit of soy sauce, black pepper and water. Put it on the salmon and bake it at 400F for 12-18 minutes (depending on how thick it is). You can also roast veg on a baking tray or steam some broccoli in the microwave.   Cut up the broccoli into pieces. Rinse, put into a bowl, and cover with a damp towel. Heat for 1-2 min and then season with salt, pepper, and sesame oil.  Enjoy~
could we see samir the accountant again
If you are freezing food meal prep two weeks worth then eat a mix of the food and at the end of the first week meal prep one more week worth then so on so fourth then you will have a good mix of food as long as you have like a rotation of recipes you won’t get bored
trying arabic food 24 h or 1 week. Recomend: shawarma, shis kebab iraqi style (any other is also good), dolma iraqi, biryani iraqi style, taboule (libanese salad) bebsi betem jam, thats just a few. aslo try sweets like baklawa, kenafe ect. I think many ppl will like this :) Arab is known for there food (im not arab im swedish).
The problem I have with meal prep is that I'm not neccessarily excited about eating the same thing several times a week.
Taz can make anything realllllllllly realllllllllly interesting .... 😂 Like why am I watching this at 2am
Please wash the rice with water until clear before you cook it :D
Make like items at the same time. So if you are making chicken, put it in multiple dishes. We personally love making batches when we make dinner. So instead of making one dinner, we double the recipe for the rest of the week. Like we just roasted a pork shoulder (9 lbs) and ate it for a few days. Then we froze the rest. We will pull it out and make it into tacos and burritos.
Hey Taz :)  Certain meals freeze really well so you can store for longer and not limit yourself to the same lunch or dinner for a week. I usually have curries/bolognese/lasagna/stuffed cabbage rolls in tomato sauce/veggie burgers in the freezer so I can choose either and prep less ''fridge'' meals for the week.  Veggie burgers come out really good from the air fryer too!  Another thing that made my life easier are glass food containers from ikea. You can put them in the oven or the microwave straight from the fridge or freezer (just replace the lid if it goes to the oven :D )  Good luck on your food prep adventure :)))
Please taste food as your cooking it so you can adjust seasoning. Instead of waiting till its made and it doesn't taste good.
Uncle Rog you tuber swears by a rice cooker, he is the reason I bought mine, I wouldn't be without it now🐻
nooo that’s so sad, you don’t ship to Australia
You can get some chicken pre-cuts, marinated with some soy, sugar and oyster sauce… so all you’ll need is to defrost and stick into the air fryer. Salmon too, just put on baking paper and add some herbs into the airfryer and aside from the thawing, it gets done in about 15-20 mins and you could’ve gone shower or do something in the meantime!
Taz posted, day=made
I’m ashamed of how scared I am of being used. I don’t want to get too close to anyone cuz I will most likely put more effort into the relationship than them, though it’s not the person’s fault. As a side effect, I don’t speak to ppl unless spoken to which I get told is wrong and I need to fix it. But I will put so much effort and I won’t get it back a dm I’m scared, which I am finding really hard to get over
My tip: You can actually cook quinoa in a rice cooker, together with spices, onions etc. You're welcome.
You should meal prep pesto pasta 😊 it is delicious and super easy!
Hi, Impulivisity is part of your ADHD and is absolutely nothing to be ashamed about. The term control reffers to suppression. A better term is manage. i.e I am managing my symptoms. To help manage impulsitivty, what helps is keeping an ideas notebook. Write down things as they come into your brain. Then close the book and come back to the idea after 15 minutes. Thus you are helping yourself manage your impulsitivty. Best of luck with your journey :)
Hey Taz, another great video, genuinely think i have adhd also, was in asda the other day and they had many variations of heinz beans, you should do a video of you tasting them and rating tham, thanks
A little hint for cooking multiple meals at a time cook all your veg at the same time all your rice at the same time meat etc at the same .
You should have a collection of condiments and sauces you can put in your food to make them taste a little bit different every day. It can be representative of the range of tastes like salty (light and dark soy sauces, sweet soy), sour (lemon sauces, tangy bbq), sweet (balsamic glaze, honey), spicy (sriracha, chili garlic), etc. Asian condiments are really good too.
Make souses, freeze. Combinations are endless. Also, stews are great. Also,freeze bread. 30 sec in microwave and its like fresh baked
Over or almost over ripe banana tip, take the peels off and freeze them , then when making a smoothie or acia bowl just bung em in the blender,  and the onions cut them up and freeze. Then you've chopped onions ready to use.
you should try incorporating more protein to your diet, I rarely see you prep meat/fish + veggies and it is a great, lighter and filling alternative ;)
Tip for multitasking mealprep: you can boil different greens at the same time that are destined for different meals. Example: carrots/potatos/brocoli
I have a ADHD and OCD and I totally understand you
I am ashamed of how indecisive I am.
We could do a professional photoshoot in Regent’s Park because u really look super photogenic Taz, my Instagram is @roman_koszyk if u wanna see my work! Would love to show u how beautiful and confident u are! 🙌🏻🙏🏻
Hey Taz. Strangely, I read a bunch of research last year suggesting exercise helps with impulsive behavior and thoughts. Key points are it must be regular, the studies I read were 5 days a week. If I remember correctly low or light cardio is good for impulsivity and yoga style motor control exercises are good for memory. But it could be the other way around.
ADHD and yet she made it through law school without even knowing she had it

Hey taz why don’t you try to cook food from around  the world for a few days maybe? Anyway love your video ❤️
Hey Taz, I also have ADHD. what I have found to help me multitask cooking is to make a lost of each step and then write out a plan. For example co-sign all the proteins at the same time.  Cutting all the veggies for all the meals at once and just putting each in a bowl. If you write out plan you will find it makes it a lot easier.
U can do recreating old photos or learning TikTok dancing
could have done air fried onions
3 food / cooking related video ideas:  1. Recreate popular chain restaurant meals at home (Nando’s, Wagamama ect.)  2. Follow along with a Youtube / TV chef for 1 meal a day  3. Dr Greger’s Daily Dozen: A whole foods plant based doctor recommended strategy for getting a healthy diet is to include 12 specific types of whole plant food into your daily meals. There is a  Daily Dozen mobile app with a checklist to help you along.
You could do liquid food for a day….. I love your videos Taz :)
Try making air fryer salmon! Season the salmon and put it in a pre heated air fryer skin side up. 10 minutes at 180degrees and you have perfect salmon. No need to meal prep
Do living of £1
You can absolutely make pancakes and waffles (they freeze beautifully) unfried fried chicken, use your new airfryer.. Chicken and waffles! You can also use your rice cooker to cook, yes that is a thing. Rice cooker chicken fried rice or veggie fried rice. Soups and stews are also a great option. Teriyaki anything including tofu. Hope that helps
I also have ADHD and the way I meal prep is I write down what I want to make,  take out all themeat, then I cut the veggies for all the recipes ,  and then I make one kind of meal at a time... if I start multi tasking I tend to stop halfway
Taz! Also please try cooking a new recipe everyday!! That would give you a lot new ones to try and figure out what to meal prep
Multitasking is actually not a real thing. Your brain can not focus on multiple actions at the same time. So, what is understood as 'multitasking" is actually just how quickly your brain can switch from one action to the other, while keeping the other action on "standby". You can train your ability to switch from one to another by a lot of exposure to create more of an automatism.  To reduce the stress while cooking multiple meals, make a plan of order. Begin with what takes the longest, i.e. preheat the oven/put food in the oven, and choose meals with a bunch of the same ingredients.  Btw, add the spinach fresh next time. You're not supposed to reheat it.
Also taco/burrito bowls is a great choice as well!
You could also make Salad Jars. You don't have use actually lettuce or spinach you can use pasta
Why taz did eat any fish?
Hey, you! Also, as a fellow adhd gal, the delaying of things is a major symptom of anxiety/self-sabotage (at its extreme, of course), but, yup, anxiety. ugh. You got this.
Taz love you lots!   Can you PLEASE PLEASE try making ramen from scratch! You would love it
i guess what i’m ashamed of is that ppl think i’m nice and a good person, but i actually think i’m a terrible person. like i wish i could naturally be a good person but i’m like not i guess. it’s complicated.🤢
i prep a chilli every month, 7 different veg, lots of mince, colemans spice sachets and tinned tomatoes, it usually makes 12-16 tubs . That wonky veg sounds awesome, going to check it out
Sees Taz upload a vid:😁😜🤪😝💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽 The vid come to an end:🙁😟🥺😔🥲
Living in your living room for 3 days, because why not haha
If you have too many onions you could just prechop them and freeze them or do what my nan does which is bulk boil onions, puree them and freeze them and then use that as curry bases
Hi! About the eggs: you can keep them up to a like week or more in the fridge, boiled and unpeeled. This way they won't go bad (unless they have cracks) peel them before eating and you are good to go.   Another way if you want to keep them peeled is looking for soy egg recipes or tea eggs. I know soy give the eggs a bunch of flavor and can last a long time in the fridge because it will keep it from spoiling.
Do southern fried chicken. Mash potatoes and then heat up BEANS. Microwave all. You can add cheese too mash potato or sauce or whatever
Alternating mealprep meals ? = Combo Ingredients. Cut ingredients portion in half 1/2, prepare differently
I had a good laugh when I saw those onions 🤣  🎬 Video idea: budgeting, how do you plan your monthly budget, how to stick to budget, savings etc
Hello Taz~~ ^_^ 1.	Oats blend with banana, apple, peanut butter, honey, and almond milk or water  2.	Banana with milk and almonds 3.	Orange juice with a sandwich 4.

I do this all the time, gravy style meals work really well..like shepherds pie and stews…I also do lasagne and casseroles x
Soups are a good option as they can last 3 days without being frozen, my favourites are lentil and veg soup and pumpkin soup to cook :) :)
what i recommend doing for porridge is using a tea kettle and adding the hot water from it. If you don't have a tea kettle i highly recommend its very easy to use and I use mine a LOT.
Am actually pretty ashamed of my anger. I feel like it’s not valid so I often stuff it down which makes me more angry at myself and the world around me. I find that my anger can sometimes bubble out in the most Unexpected places especially when I’m triggered and I have to apologize for  my emotions which can make me feel defeated and validate the voice that tells me anger isn’t valid. It’s one of the only internal cycles I hate of mine.
You should try delivery services like gousto or hello fresh. They have so many food options and give you all the ingredients and a simple easy to follow recipe
I make a family size meal each time I cook and freeze the other portions so I have my own microwave meals ready when I can't be bothered. It take no longer than cooking one meal because you're already cooking it anyway
My job here in Sydney is to go into people’s homes and meal prep there whole week 😂 best way to do multiple things at once is to have all ingredients chopped & weighed out and in groups of what dish you are using it for, then doing similar steps at the same time for each dish, like if you have to fry off onions for 2 dishes do it at the same time. (Can even do it in the same pan then split them. Then if something needs to go in the oven do that first becuase then while it’s in the oven you can do other stuff etc
video suggestion: explore different places in England and record your experiences!
Taz, I really think you need an instant pot (Duo Evo Plus 10 in 1 OR 7-1 on amazon)  in your life !! It takes so much stress off you and makes cooking really really fun. Basically it’s a pressure cooker where you can cook an entire meal in one pot , over hours and hours without supervision (you can slowcook, roast, sauté , keep warm, steam etc) and it’s just really useful for people who hate multitasking because everything is in one pot (also like, it’s just one dish to clean, hooray!). Sarcasm aside, I’m so sad none of my friends recommended this to me when I was in uni. Now that I’m about to start my first job it’s such a life saver and honestly helps me meal prep. Plus it gives me a great meal when I come home all tired from work. 10/10 can recommend!!
I needed am this video. Perfect timing
buy large piece salmon side fillet and cut it into 3.5 centimetre stripes. Put it in one layer on tray or Tupperware then freeze it. Take out a piece when you want to bake in the oven. Put salt pepper herbs lemon juice and drizzle of oil or butter ready to bake at 180C
I never knew u were doing law😮
Try food at a fancy restaurant?
Taz, you should try Polish pierogi - you can make them with any stuffing you want and keep frozen. It is a go to of everyone in Poland who doesn't want to cook too often :)
If you haven’t already go find howtoadhd on YouTube she’s a gem and helped explain myself to me, my partner and my family. I love her work
My only tip is I only prep for 2/3 days maximum so I would do a Sunday prep for Mon-Wed and then on Wed prep the remaining days of the week and always have 1/2 days I can eat whatever I want :)
Video idea:try Slovakian food/snacks(it’s similar to polish)
This is such a weird coincidence I've been thinking of getting an ADHD screening lately 😅 Don't really know how to go about it because a lot of the symptoms are similar to bipolar 2 which I'm diagnosed with and I feel awkward saying anything about ADHD in case they think I'm trying to self-diagnose 😫
Taz for more food ideas, why don’t you make lentils and this could be made as a curry or just simply. You could also make others like kidney beans, could get some garlic naan from lidl that taste quite nice as well. And more veggies and make a curry out of it. You might like it🤷🏻‍♀️
Hope this is not a weird compliment but Taz you have beautiful lips! The line down your lips is 😍 xx
Lasagne is always good for freezing and portioning, some kind of stew with veg, gravy and potatoes, daal too xxx
Cooked food stored in the fridge lasts 4-5 days max that’s why after that it tastes funky!
Heyy check out @howtoadhd YouTube channel I’ve found it so incredibly helpful for my adhd over the years ☺️
I’m ashamed that I am very over-sensitive (does this word even exist lol). Whether it be in terms of my emotions and perceiving others or just overwhelming situations. I feel anxious when I step out of my house cause just the existence of other people around me leads to a sensory overload. Maybe it has also something to do with Rona cause I‘m kind of not used to „human interactions“ anymore.
I'd really love a zero waste London edition
Hi Taz😆, Just wanted to share some of the recipes😋 that you can cook and freeze it while it last till weeks or months. I usually do it when my procastinating mood came when the 'time of the month' came or exams week. Usually make it for 2 person or more to last long.  1. Buttermilk chicken asian style ( usually just do the sauce only and freeze it because the chicken will get soaked and not crispy anymore, plus you can cook it with any meat subtitute or veges and even pasta works too ) :  https://makan.ch/recipe/malaysian-butter-chicken/  Mostly i just eat it with chicken nugget pop in the air fryer and rice pre cook or fridge or freeze, either way is good for me.  2. Curry based soupy/stew style for any meat or veges :  (instant paste) https://rasamalaysia.com/chicken-curry-with-potatoes/#mv-creation-120 Or this  https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a27423175/easy-coconut-curry-chicken-recipe/  Its great to with any curry you like actually but I usually cook it like this. And the paste you can try finding it in asian market or amazon.  3. Freeze fried rice shrimp (batches) :  https://damndelicious.net/2017/08/29/freezer-shrimp-fried-rice/  4. Salmon foil : https://damndelicious.net/2014/12/19/asian-salmon-foil/ ( I make batches of it and when i want to eat it just pop in the air fryer or oven or microwave )  Lastly, would be breakfast style burrito (but heavy and again batches) :  https://dinnerthendessert.com/mongolian-beef-burrito/  And this is just one of my fav recipes that I would like to share with you, and anyone who would like to try it.🤗  Most of the meals I just pop it in the microwave/air fryer or heat it on stove, whenever I need or in the mood. The rice can also pre cook and freeze it right after it cool to room temperature and it will be good for one month or just fridge but I like my rice fresh cook it the morning and lasted till dinner rather than freeze or fridge more then 3 days.
You and Grace should cook for each other (3 courses) 🤷🏽‍♀️
A slow cooker might help
"i'm just gonno go around handing people onions" 😂
Multi-tasking tips --  First thing you should setup are foods that can can cook on their own without much effort (i.e. coffee, rice, boiling water, toaster oven). Set audio timer for these things so they don't overcook or burn.   While these things are cooking, prep for next dish. This can include cutting veggies, taking out spices, cuting meat etc. Have all of them nearby.   Next check on your auto-cook items from before. Turn off or plate items that are done.   Finally, cook the active dish on preferably medium /low-medium heat by using the prepped ingredients. This ensures that nothing gets burned. By the time this dish is cooked (usually minutes), the remaining auto-cook dishes will probably also be done.   It's all about timing different parts of the dish and keeping a mental note of it all. It definitely takes some practice, but with some effort and time, anyone can do it! It's a matter of getting in your own flow state and trying different things out to see what works for you. Good luck!
As a person that cooks a lot, I suggest you to write down every single process (for example: boiling the pasta) so as to plan everything you have to do on your mind. You can chop all the veggies for all of the meals, while you boiling the pasta and making the rice and then you can put the veggies and the chicken in their pans put the spices and let them cook simultaneously. Hope it helps 🍰
I loved this! I would love to see what you decide to make each week - like a regular series.
I've been struggling with this for so long. It's so good to hear someone else talk about it. You described me to a T
TOP TIP (which changed my life by the way) : Keep the boiled eggs in their shells and store them in the fridge for upto 7 days
Put a wet papertowel on or near the chopping board. Thank me later
You can make quinoa in the ricemaker btw
I would love a thrifting video! But I always like your cooking video's as well <3
I always need red onions lol 😂 x
I hate to say I knew you had adhd, but as someone with adhd...
Miss gurlll taste as you gooo !!! 💓
It would be Fun to watch the national dishes from each country you have been in👌
Welcome to the adhd Community! I was diagnosed last summer and the knowledge I gained, the therapy and medication helped me improve my life and grow personally so much.   You've got some great times ahead! The more you learn about it, the more your whole life will make sense.  I really liked the youtube videos from "how to ADHD" to get some greater knowledge about it and how to deal with it in your real life.   Please don't be ashamed of your impulsiveness! It makes you a far more interesting person and fuels creativity like nothing else. Well, If you have some impulsive behaviours, that are actually bad for you, it helps to try regularly take a step back and think about weather you're acting impulsive (for example by not pressing the buy button on an online shop the same day you put it in your cart).   Oh and meal prep really helped me to eat healthy every day. My tip would be to keep it simple: I Prep my Dinner in advance and eat nothing or something simple for Breakfast...
pizza,cottage pie,sweet and sour,pies,stews,love your vidoes xx
I wish I could meal prep, it just makes everything so easy! But my bf doesn't like re heated food so I can't do it =( Check out Downshiftology I think she has meal prep videos
Video ideas: ask for suggestions on random basic pieces of clothing (to your followers on insta) and then you have to go on a hunt at thrifting stores. Or something like that. Or do a challenge where you have to eat a whole day only foods that start with the letters of your name (you should cook the ingredients, but if you don’t find a bunch of options you can just use that ingredient as the main one of the dish). Or a video trying smoothie mixes that your followers have for breakfast and give you the recipes through insta. Or smth like that. Have fun🤍 I love your videos. I always felt really related to you and now I know we both have ADHD which kinda makes me feel closer :)
i think im ashamed of how im not rlly my own person and i just like leach onto other peoples ideas of me and opinions in fear that they wont like the real me under it all
When I find meat on sale, like ground beef.  I will cook it up with salt and pepper till its brown and crumbly.   I than store in the freezer in serving size freezer bags.  Then if i want to make tacos or spaghetti all i need to do is defrost and add the appropriate seasoning.   It really cuts down on the time it takes to cook dinner.  I will also grill up hamburger patties and chicken and keep in the freezer.  Just defrost add a veg or salad.  Dinner is done!
i’m on the autism/ADHD spectrum myself and my biggest concern with meal prep is that i’d get tired of what i made 2-3 days in and then the food would go to waste
Whenever I make quiche I always make 3 different ones, veg, chicken, salmon (variations are endless) Cook them and freeze them in portions. It’s the perfect thing when we don’t have anything to eat. I also freeze in lasagna in portions.
All the extra food you can’t eat put on Olio 😊
Prepare a thai green or red curry base with coconut milk. And pop in salmon or grilled chicken, veggies when you want to eat.
Stir fry shrimp with butter, garlic, chili flakes and dried basil. Serve with rice.  So first, you put a little bit of oil, fry the minced garlic for a bit. When it gets color on the edges, add the shrimp. Just right before the shrimp gets cooked, add butter, chillies, and dried basil. Meal sorted in 5-7 minutes.
You can prepare the salmon for cooking, spices, sauce, greens and then freez it without cooking in a oven proof container . Then when you are hungry, pop it in the oven or maybe even the air frier?
I’m ashamed of how I make big ambitious plans and then just never do it. It makes me feel lazy and kind of like a failure 👍
Excuse me, but I'm a little confused....Since when does not linking doing some tasks, and postponing them (which is essentially procrastinating), equal to having ADHD ?? Following that logic, it would mean every single person on this planet has this disorder, since we all postpone the things we do not like doing. It's ridiculous.  People like you, who are healthy, smart, and pretty, should stop putting disorder labels all over themselves.  Other than that, love you content, puts a smile on my face every time I watch it :)
I want a big freezer like that

Don't waste all of the onions use what you have to do in your meals and then if you have spare onions left chopped the rest of the onions up put them in tubs or food bags and put it in your freezer and you can use the onions in fruit in your Foods later on in life straight from frozen then you don't have to buy onions really again from the shop you can you just use from frozen in your food
If you salt you porridge or put cinnamon and or vanilla in it it tastes even better! Apple sauce is great too!
I literally love your vids!!
I think I have ADHD I can stay hours in my daydreams with my fantasy life lol but I'm not diagnosed :/
I find a slow cooker is really good for meal prep. I usually spend about 15 mins cutting stuff up in the morning and putting it in then leave it on low for 8 hours then it's ready for the evening :)  One of my favourite recipes to make in there is a vegetable and quinoa curry. Texture wise it ends up dhal like.
Focus on cooking one by one. Once you got a hang of it, add one multitask at a time.
You can slice banana up and freeze it works well for banana ice cream or smoothies.
I'd love a real talk video just like chatting 🥰🥰
Idea for new video: react to one of your oldest videos. 😁
Pinterest is a really good place to start searching for things to mealprep. Also Whisk is alright too ^^
Best tip I have for cooking multiple things in one go is to cut everything before you even start and stay organized, keep your cut vegetables and whatnot in different containers and have them ready so you can grab them easily when you need them! Clean as you go!
Air fryer life ❤️
Tip for Autistic/Depressed folk: Precook the "easy" parts of the meal such as veg/protein/potatoes. Having them ready to add to ramen/eggs/soup helps to keep your diet less scurvy-prone.
Try doing a meal prep of some specific cuisine and that way you can also also explore your options.
Ohhhh my Goshh!! Taz is becoming morr and more relatable to me now. ADHD FAMS 🙌
the to good to go ones are so good
I've already watched this video twice..
NUCLEAR FIRE NOODLE CHALLENGE PLEASEEEE ☺️☺️☺️☺️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Review the egg boiler thingie. My dad got it and he loves it.
I'm ashamed that when I like someone romantically, I start avoiding them. 🥺
The way I use meal prep.  Cook one meal a day for a week.  But, cook enough for several portions.  Eat one on the day you cook it and freeze the rest in portions for future quick meals.  I like.   Spaghetti bolognese, freeze the  bolognese cook the spaghetti on the day you want to eat it.   Macaroni cheese freezes surprisingly well.   Cottage or shepherds pie, Chilly con carney.  Freeze the rice and chilly separately.  Cooked rice freezes well. Curry of you're choice, again freeze rice separate from the sauce. Stew.  I cook the potatoes on the day And add the stew.  Or have bread and butter with it. Lasagne.
Yay taz ur always makin bangin lookin food always makin me hungry 🤤😋 please start doing mukbangs!!! 🥰❤️
A friend of mine gave me a really good tip for the whole 'crying whilst cutting onions' thing. Make sure that your hands and knife are wet when you cut them. It sounds a bit weird, but it honestly really works!
Would like to see you try romanian food 🙂
Meat or veg lasagne. Or even shepherds pie. Tuna pasta bake. All good options
You can cook your quinoa in the rice cooker as well
Maybe for a video you could try learning a new skill/craft/language for a week or month!!
You can use same tomato gravy add different flavours with different spices and make variety of dishes .
can you try tik tok crafts
I like to wash and cut all my veg first so I don't have to keep washing the cutting board. I like making a good ragu sauce with lots of veg and then use that same sauce to make a bunch of different things, pasta, lasagna, curry, fish stew, soups, pasta bakes or just use it to top a potato. If you add different spices to each dish you would never know the base sauce was the same.
Me watching this while eating my 8th takeout order of this week: 👁👄👁
I am ashamed of myself that i sometimes overdo things such as talking, being friendly, being enthusiastic etc. and dont realize it until i cant sleep because of it.
Can u do a video of eating South Indian food for 24 hrs
You could make biryani
I can relate to you so much that’s why I love watching your videos it’s like you’re my best friend but behind a screen
I have autism and dyslexia and it’s so funny I’m literally watching a person that’s got ADHD I literally love watching your videos and you are so funny you help me get through school I hate school but you help me and my mental health thank you xx
The secret to multitasking is to sit down and write a master's list than follow the detailed steps one at a time crossing of as you complete the task.
I love watching your videos and trust me when I say this I am not a person who sticks to any particular creator but you idk I just can never get bored. Just please never stop making videos taz🤍 loads of love
Why don't you try freezing lasagna?
I love your videos when you try different kinda of food so maybe do a video where you try different restaurants in london?
just when you thought Taz couldn't possibly get any more relatable, she opens up about her getting diagnosed with ADHD as an adult (though I'm almost 29 and idk if I'll ever have the chance to get diagnosed, because mental healthcare is an absolute joke where I live) also Taz, if you happen to see this comment, mindfulness is one of the things that could really help your impulsivity, definitely give it a try also, I cannot recommend the How to ADHD YouTube channel enough ❤️
I think the food thing many of us adhdler are struggling with! Welcome to being a neurodiverse person! It's what we call our community🤗
You need to keep your todolist have a rolemodel when it comes to sturucture and the way of approaching situations so you can navigate diffrently trought get more confidene develope your femininity 😊 have an environment that keeps you on track learn to listen more and try some methods of perceiving more than judging learn to speak calm so you be calm and have routines girl
Rice Cooker…….Uncle Roger would be so proud
Omg, I also have ADHD :)
I have the opposite of her hate for cooking, i loooove cooking it just distracts my mind when im over thinking and gives me something “productive” to do when im stressed, the sense of control that i have in the kitchen also helps when im overwhelmed in other aspects of my life. I enjoy cooking as a stress reliever (i hate baking tho because i can’t focus on measurements when im stressed). But my issue is that i don’t end up eating what i cook, i can say confidently that my food is good, i always get praised but after im destressing in the kitchen the last thing that i want to do is sit down and i eat, idk it’s weird. Sometimes it goes to waste :( i try to give away the food as much as possible but on big cooking days (when im realllllyyyyy overwhelmed with things) i just end up with so much food that im even embarrassed to tell my friends if they want some lol i would probably look crazy and i honestly don’t want to answer anyone’s questions or have them worry. Anyways i wish Taz lived next door 😂😂😂 that would solve my problem and hers
I'm a chef and here's my biggest tip on how to work on multiple dishes at once:  (As an example) if you have multiple dishes that call for sautéed onions, cut up however much you need for all the recipes combined. Grab the number of bowls that corresponds with the number of dishes and put the needed amount of onions in each bowl. Do this for each repeating ingredients (for me, onions, garlic and bell peppers tend to be in most of my cooking, so I cook them all together and then split them up.) Once you've cooked all those bits, you'll find that each dish only needs a few additions to finish it up (sauces, spices, etc.)  Starting with rice and pasta is great as you can use those as bases for multiple meals. Same for proteins: choose your "main protein" for the week, cook plain then split. Choose other proteins that you can also prep in bulk: boiled eggs, lentils (can both be done in your rice cooker!), any canned meats you may use, etc. Using tomato sauce in multiple dishes? Heat up one large batch then split and season for each dish.  Basically, if you break your recipes down into parts, you'll find that there are many different ingredients that you can bulk prep and then split and modify for corresponding dishes.  If you have questions, please feel free to contact me. There are a lot of ingredients that you can bulk prep! Part of the lure of meal prepping is finding dishes with common ingredients and being able to bulk prep those common ingredients. (I sauté a whole bunch of kale then use it in all of my recipes for that week. Add to a quiche, a soup, a curry, etc.)
welcome to the adhd gang! all my faves are neurodivergent ❤️ haven’t finished the whole video yet - but a really good adhd friendly way to meal prep is by making staple items in bulk and then turning them into a variety of meals  like one thing of rice can make rice and beans, burritos, etc  so if you have a list of those basic building blocks you can make them into a new meal every day!
Wow your rings are so beautiful 😍do you love wearing rings Taz?
The key to multi-tasking at cooking is to get faster at cutting the food (or use a machine) and especially leave the stove on a low heat! Worked for me :)
You can chop all of those onions and freeze so you’ll have chopped onions whenever you need!
Legit wanted to comment on the adhd thing, waiting for an assesment myself and see the trasits in you
I think I got ADHD but I like to think I'm delusional instead of getting professional help 🙃
I love ramen so for meal prep you can actually make ramen at home and eat it that way keep the noodles and broth separate thou soy sauce ones come out great✨
I have ADD, kinda the same as ADHD except for the hyperactivity. And i’ve always struggled with impulsiveness. The one thing that did help me a bit was practicing mindfulness daily. I am also on medication but i definitely noticed that mindfulness helped me.
If an eggs are hard to peel it means they are fresh. If on the other hand they are peeled easily, it means they have been sitting in a counter for a while.
I'm ashamed how I cant commit to any  work in particular academics. I keep putting it off and it's taking a big toll on me. I wish to work on it.....
My current go to recipe: cold noodle salad with chili oil, soy sauce, and lime juice.   Just soak some rice noodle in hot water, while chop some peppers, cucumber and salad leaf.  You can use whatever veggies you want, I just use whatever that dont need to be cooked. Once the noodle is soft, drain & rinse under cold water, then mix with the veggies.  Pour some chili oil, soy sauce, and lime juice according to your taste, and bam! Lunch is served.  Perfect for hot weather, and for people who cant be bothered to cook. I sometimes add leftover grilled chicken or fish too :)
Taz:  I like eating but I don’t like making it ….same sis same 😂
when mealprep I try to cut everything in one sitting, maybe try one pan/pot meals  and last I use different appliances like oven and rice cooker and set timers. We love you!
Taz you should watch June from delish for inspiration ☺️ cause she cooks bomb food 🔥 but on a budget ✌🏻.
My answer :I'm ashamed of my thoughts like overthinking. I get lost every now and then. I overthink every single thing taht comes to my mind. And I don't even know if it'll ever happen. But it really keeps me up almost every night
If you don’t want to cry when cutting onions put a wet rag or paper towel under the cutting board or on it right next to the onion and it won’t name you cry I promise it works
Heard Moon has a boyfriend and is pregnant
I’ve been trying to meal prep aswell . I done chicken Thai yellow curry,chilli con carne,bolynese with chorizo,peri peri chicken with rice,lentil curry. I done that in one day and I’m same as you I get so flustered preparing different meals 😂
Meal prep is really bad for me because I get really bored. What's really helped is meal planning. It helps with budget and even though I still have to cook, I don't have to think about what to cook so it's much better and i have more varied food throughout the week
I've been making this oven pasta dish that I love. It's a take on the feta pasta that went viral a couple months ago. I roast the grape tomatoes. Then add spinach and cooked chicken and roast that. Then I add some cheese. Cook it till the cheese is melted. Smash it all together and add noodles. It takes like 30 minutes and if my boyfriend didn't eat it all 1 pan would probably do lunch for me for atleast 3 days
Loving these meal prep videos! Any chance you would consider doing one every week?
Love U lots 😁💜 And when peeling eggs try using a spoon, It's much easlier.
We freeze our Bananas and something we've been doing lately is blending the banana with milk to make banana milk and then using that to cook our porridge. Means no Bananas go to waste but we don't have to eat really brown or frozen. 🍌
I think I have adhd too cause I have most of the symptoms but I'm not diagnosed yet
For another version og porridge in the morning, you should try adding in apple.   Grate half the apple and put it in the pan and boil with water and oats. When they're done add the other half apple, which is cut into smaller pieces, on top of the oats and add some cinnammon.
Video ideas: making your own rug, painting something big, trying something with nails, building a small piece of furniture/making an old piece of furniture pretty, trying a new style of clothing, making faux-stained glass  P.s.: Why did you pre-peel the eggs ?!?
For some reason..watching taz cooking makes me wanna cook too 🙈🙈
Have you thought about collaborating with a cooking channel like Sorted? Maybe they can show you some easy, tasty recipes
please go try wendy’s burger in Reading UK !! or do more car videos like before, those were so fun!
make a video about the shows you have watched  whatever k drama or English series or moviesss
I am studying for my psychology exam, so I don't have time to watch this video... I am so glad, that you are back Taz <3... I will watch your video when I go to bed
EVERY SINGLE TIME WE WATCH OUR TAZ WE HAVE BEEN BLESS-ED
I have ADHD too and I really relate to you Taz! Now I know why 😂
Hey taz I love watching your meal preps..I know you love pasta so it would be interesting to see you do a low carb/keto meal prep too 🥰🥰xx
fun fact: spinach isn't acc as good for you as people think. the guy recording the amount of iron in it way back when got the decimal points messed up so its only got like the same amount of iron than any other green veg has like broccoli or peas :)
Ashamed trait: I dont show my affection to friends and family like i should but it makes me cringe and i only want to say and do things if I really mean it in the moment too many people go around throwing “i love you” to too many people willy nilly.
Cook salmon but eat it at the beginning of the week instead of later on!
Try Southwest Tofu Scramble for Breakfast or Lunch! :D Vegan, inexpensive, and full of protein!  Ingredients: One block of Tofu, Can of Black Beans, One Onion, Tumeric, Oregano, Cumin, Chili Powder.  On a low-medium heat in a frying pan: Lightly fry off one onion, crumble in a whole block of extra firm tofu and leave it for five minutes, don't stir! Then put a teaspoon of Turmeric, Oregano, and Cumin, as well as 2 teaspoons of Chili Powder and one, can of black beans (drain and wash first). Stir it all in and let it cook for another five minutes and you're good to go! I like to serve mine with some tomato ketchup and maybe some spring onion. If I use the Tofoo XL I can split this recipe over three days.
am ashamed of having panic attacks.  I dont even know when I started building this but yah recently discovered that such a symptom was a severe pain attack.
Congrats on getting the help you need for your ADHD! I have diagnosed ADD and Autism and it can take a while to get diagnosed, so I'm happy for you! :)
Taz, just wanna let you know - you're doing amazing sweetie x
😀👍
You should definitely attempt the 10,000 calorie challenge!!
I only come to YouTube to watch Taz videos now. I’m addicted to the videos of this lovely human  P.s- if you wanna do Salmon taz just keep it cut up in meal slices in the freezer. Any time you want you can just throw salt and pepper onto it and get it in the oven for 20-30 min. Minimum effort though it takes awhile. Unfortunately salmon is best served fresh but you can do a little to make your life easier.
I guess you add some salt to water while boiling eggs and it makes the peeling process easier..I m not sure but I guess it works ...also I really like your videos taz..also you taking care of yourself is amazing..really want to more about this journey..
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS URE SO INSPIRING 🥰
When I heard you today talk about yourself and being diagnosed with adhd, I just wanted to put this out to you - as a student of psychology who comes across the stigma around mental health almost every day, I am so so grateful and happy for you to have put it out in a positive way❤️  And also It will be a slow process but slowly you will change things you want to♥️
Taz for Prime Minister❗
me: relates to almost every adhd issue, meme, things people talk about about it  My mom: you don't have adhd i know it lmao  Well im SORRY that you're probably the only one in the house with undiagnosed adhd 😑
One meal prep idea. Maybe just dumplings? You can like air fry them to heat them up and it’s pretty good.  Another idea is jon... jeon? Idk but in Korean, it’s 전. It’s like a “pancake” but for like a meal with rice... just an idea!
Day in the life of taz
How about a video where you try gross weird food combos that other people like- for example I quite like to dip Mars bars in curry sauce 🤣
I have adhd i was diagnosed at 6. I am always here if you need any help or advice and Such a great video xxx
Hi
Onions are a fantastic buy as they keep for *months*
If you are planning to meal prep after this. Then please upload a video on your every meal prep. Watching you cook feels therapeutic to me 🌻
Yay Taz uploaded ^-^
Hi taz whenever u prep meal always just boil the pasta and fill up the big box of it n make like 2 3  Different saucese..   then u can make  different pasta easily  Tip 2 just like pasta make lots of white rice n fill up a box n make dishes like butter chicken or lentils or chickpea curry  u can easily switch these things... Or stir fry with frozen vegetables  I am a chef n this a restaurant methods we use in our restaurant like this food shelf life is long n u can have food according to ur moods   Just like that u can have tortilla in ur fridge n make some different chicken, beef or any kind of filling n some salad on hand also then u can have it  Also u can fry tortillas to make nachos Out of it just cut in to triangles   There are lots of things u can do like these  Also  u can free banana peal n pack in tin foil n free it u can have banana peanut butter smoothie  Plz add lots of fruits n smoothie in ur diet
Can we have a day in the life ?
Heyy, the human brain isn't really built to multitask, so if you get stressed that's pretty normal
Mexican food is apparently perfect for meal planning theres a video by Home Pro Cooks where he explains why
Porridge tip, add cinnamon it makes your breakfast so tastey.
I hear you on the impulsiveness, I would say mine is how reactive I am... Some times it's a good thing, but often it's not... Attempting to slow down the reactions with breath work, mindful movement and outdoor walks :) Lots of love to you Taz and I'm massively inspired to do some meal prep now... Have you tried a meal prep service, we used AllPlants for a bit and was great to have quick, healthy meals in the freezer x x x
If you want to cook a lot of things in one go. If you have onions in all of them, cut the amount of onions you need in one go. Have try and have one thing on the hob and chopping board at one go. And in the oven if you can!
Dear Taz , I don’t think you have ADHD, probably 99.9% of the population on Earth experience Attention Deficit Hyperactive “Disorder”  please do not accept medication for this. Also everyone can feel overcrowded in their mind from time to time. In terms, of a video idea you could go to a place called Camden Town and try different food from different cultures and get a good bargain in the market.
A good app you could use is gettir
I am ashamed that I can't let go of toxic relationships
Try reading some books and give reviews on how you liked them. Mainly coz I want to know what type of books you’d like
I have no idea if you'll read this but here is a trip from a long time meal prepper with ADHD. Group together similar tasks. So all your veggie prep do it together. All the proteins get cooked simultaneously. That way you can multi task and get a lot done and not get stressed.  Love from India  💕
I tried to meal prep, but I ended up eating everything the same day :)
Quinoa can also be batch cooked in the rice cooker!
Hi Taz! I would love if you do more outfit challenges. I really liked the video of you trying different aesthetics 👍❤️
Taz I don’t think you realize how many peoples day you make. Also YES THIS IS THE BEST MERCH
I make tikka masala sauce and eat it one day with chicken, next with paneer, next with beef meatballs, next with fish, next with chickpeas or even mixed veg just stir fried. Sometimes I add boiled egg. Chilli con carne with rice or in wraps like enchiladas with tomato sauce and melted cheese on the top. Just some ideas😗
i'm ashamed of my lack of will power
Ripe bananas make the best banana bread!
Lmao that explains why I relate to you so much because I have adhd too 😂. I feel the comment about food so much and order out a lot because of it. It’s hilarious because I always thought the meals you make are so low effort. So I add a lot of the meals you make to my routine 😂
Another tip is to pre bag your frozen veg so it is all portioned out meaning you just need to grab and go. Also a slow cooker is fantastic in winter months. Prep it all then dump it in the slow cooker in the morning then in the evening it is all cooked and smells amazing!
Meal ideas- tacos, fajitas, burritos, Mac n cheese.
I would love to watch you talk about ur mental health or ways it made you feel better? Idk but I love ur videos. Hope u always stay healthy and happy. Know that you matter <3
about the salmon, where I live, we always use the freezer, so even when we buy fish we just clean them then store them in the freazer for weeks, so you'r tottally fine with freezing salmon as far as I know, you'll just cook it afterwards
I thin you are a really good cook when you do it.  Keep going.  Prep things like ratatouille, Mediterranean chicken casserole, ragu and soups.  I'd love to see you get together with Grakle and Hannah Marling and go camping for a weekend
U should try making pasta from scratch
If you have a slow cooker you could make up all ur fresh veg meat sauce and make it up in a bag put it in the freezer then stick it in the slow cooker that morning then you have fresh meals every day! If you use slow cooker bags you won’t have as much washing up either xx
HUMMUS & PITA BREAD
The problem with meal prep for me is that somedays I feel so sad and then I start eating all the food I made :] and it's kinda not works with my diet too. I don't know what to do I think I also have pcos/depression/adhd :] and I can't be eating certain foods. I just end up hating myself and it's all a cycle :"]
I love so much all of your videos !  You are a sunshine and brighten my day everytime :) In the past, you made videos about BTS, could make another one about them please ???
Hey Taz, is there any chance you would be interested in movie reviews or show review? I remember you said that you like K-Dramas, so maybe could could tell us how you feel about your favorite K-Dramas :)
Fr meal prep ideas I follow @emilynorris... She is a mom blogger but her meal prep ideas are very innovative.
Look on Pinterest for meal plan ideas
Im ashamed of not being able to get my hw done ✋🏼😚
Hi , I'm a fellow ARMY  and I love your videos so so sooo much , as for the video suggestion , I liked the "1 pound a day" budget eating video you made in Cardiff  maybe you can make a series of videos with the same concept for a week in London 😀
You can definitely store Indian style chicken curries  They won't taste as funky cz of the number of spices usd in them
Sheetpan meals are great for multitasking! Just chuck everything on baking trays/sheetpans and put them in the oven. You only have to give it a toss once in a while and swap the trays (up or down in the oven) for even browning
Have you heard of the YouTube channel Goodful? There’s a girl there who’s a professional meal prepped and she has some really good tips on how to multitask in an easy way. It could be worth looking up. :)
I know that you love your take away box collection Yet I dnt thnk storing food in plastic containers is good for ur health 😅
her eyebrows are so nice
I love ❤️ her 🥘 meal prep
my boyfriend left me and i was depressed, you changed my mind i love you taz
Now I think I have adhd 💀💀
Prep your fruit and veg ready for cooking all together before cooking each dish separately. It'll save time. You'll obviously end up with a couple of plates of slices vegetables, herbs and meat and then you can align your spices and bish bash bosh. Ingredient prepping will also include making a big old pot of rice.   Potato salad is a great meal prep option as it goes well with all meat and salad. Chicken wings are also a good meal prep item  Also banana tip: peel bananas and wrap them in foil and shove those bad boys in the freezer. Frozen banana is yummy but it'll also keep it fresher for longer
while things are bubbling and cooking prep other meals so it flows easier and its not just one meal, done. one meal, done. makes it so much easier
Tip to make the eggs easy to peel: crack them ever so slightly before you put them in the water, just enough so you hear the shell crack slightly and get a couple of hairline fractures. That’ll allow water to get in during cooking and make them super easy to peel.
When you’re cutting onions, wet a paper towel and put it near the onions to prevent crying
I know you did the one pound challenge many times before but what if you made like a meal prep for 7 pounds so that it's one pound a day?
hi taz, when I was a student, I won't really be meal prepping (cos it can actually get expensive up front), but i would shop the clearance and cook a HUGE batch of something each week that can last for many weeks.  so every week, I am adding a new dish to my inventory of dishes, while rotating between the stock I already have. things do need to be frozen well, but curries, sauces, even fried rice can keep for up to 2 months. I did have to invest in a bigger freezer, but well worth it.   i found cooking a single HUGE batch of something was much more manageable than a whole day (or two!) of cooking multiple dishes.   it really helps to take the load of a massive "meal prep cooking day" while also giving flexibility to have new options added to the inventory as and when good ingredients appear via the clearance aisle.   hope that makes sense!
Pinterest is the best place to find new recipes and then when you find one you like you can write it down to make in the future.
You really need to learn how to put spices in your food
maybe use smoked salmon instead of fresh? that might be easier to keep? idk just a guess hahah
i wonder what taz's MBTI personality is...
You should add lemon to your rice after heating it. It changes the dish to a whole another level 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
for snacks you try cucumber cream cheese sandwich with zaatar seasoning (best combo ever)
The youtube channel Adaline's Kitchen has loads of meal prep ideas
When she opened the rice cooker I suddenly remembered that one scene from "So not worth it" where they plug in the rice cooker and then the power will go off for the whole station ykwim? 😂
Video idea - I thought till now you will check this huge Italian supermarket Eataly. It sounds and looks like fun and I would know if it's worth to move my ass and go there ;)
If you put a wet paper towel infront of the onion when you’re chopping it you won’t cry, it’s known that onion fumes go to the closest water source 2 then which is your eyes so if you put wet paper towel infront of them it helps!👀💖
If you want to be more organized while cooking, what you can do is do all your chopping at once then measure out all your ingredients and then cook them simultaneously. That way when you are doing one step you can just be there at that moment and not run around 🤣🤷🏻‍♀️
third time watching taz meal prep : did i enjoy it ... yes
Make a video on your paranormal experience
Idk if anyone else has commented this yet but the trick to making multiple meals at once when meal prepping is using different appliances simultaneously. This means you pre heat the oven and while it preheats you “prep” (chop, dice, rinse anything) for all your meals. And while you have a meal cooking in the oven you use that time to cook another meal on the stovetop. By the time the oven is done you can have the stovetop food done too.  I also recommend “1 pan/tray” dishes where everything is cooked in one pan or baked in one baking tray in the oven for easier meal prep and cleaning.
I hope you wash the new bought utensils before it's first use!!!!!
Please don't reheat spinach. Its really unhealthy and even Dangerous for children and pregnet women. Through reheating spinach becomes toxic. Well Not the spinach itself but something Happens while reheating and thats bad.
New video !!!!
You may not see this Taz but I subscribed 5 years ago when you were doing spoken word. Your videos helped me through depression at my lowest time. I just finally wanted to thank you. I’m from Oklahoma I don’t even remember how I found your channel but it changed my life. Your channel has blown up now and you deserve it all. Thank you so much and keep going
Taz goes on a dating app to meet a proper boy……..
God, you are an amazing human
Prep all the veg, meats and then carbs and then it'll be easier to just add it when you need it for your meals!
Am i the only one here who doesn't believe in all this adhd BS..? I think it's just another stupid label people put to each other or to themselves. What for? To justify common human behaviour..? Common expressions of anxiety? Personality traits? 'Cause that's all it is.
Haven't even watched the video as yet, but you have made my Friday just by posting. K, byeeeeeee
Where can I get the table talk cards🥺🥺 Someone help me out please 🥺🥺
Cut the bananas and freeze them and you can make smoothies! 🥤
when i first started watching your videos, i felt so connected and for some reason felt so seen. Its comforting to know that someone out there is going through the same things as i do. Everything that you shared in this video is exactly how i feel. I truly appreciate you!!!!
Hey Taz, i'm pretty certain i have ADHD too but have no idea how to go about getting diagnosed! I live in in london as well, would you mind sharing the process in getting your diagnosis, would be so helpful!
you can totally use your rice cooker to make your quinoa! it’s even easier that way!
Hey thank you for talking about stuff that people ignore it really comforts other people . You rock queen ❤️
16:45  Maybe trying favorite foods from your subscribers, that way you get new recipe ideas and your followers can be part of the video.
For cooking multiple meals at once put one of them in the oven! The chicken and veg could be roasted in the oven while you do something else. The curry was a 1 pot meal. So have that on the back burner on the stove while you make another dish on the front burners. The curry can just relax there until you're done!
Now that you have a rice cooker, prep different types of curries and dal recipes, freeze them, and eat them with freshly cooked rice. And most of the Indian style curries require similar ingredient prep like onion, garlic, ginger, and tomato, which makes meal prep easier. For Example: 1.Palak-paneer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5sr50WL1DY  2. butter chicken https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHfhCXkJh34 3. chickpea curry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAIWTuf0pbU 4. daal fry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DHYyoG5r9c    Also, there are one-pot meals that can be done in a rice cooker like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YieIRSCHndM
Video Idea: Visit an Amusement park or something?  Only after getting vaccinated though 😇
Plan ahead for multitask   Imagine before hand where you wanna go then go step by step
I'm I the only Kenyan here?😅          I'm a big fun 🙈🙈🙈
Have recipes with you in order to multitask (that’s what I do 😂
Ideas:Budget ideas for London /covid friendly ideas Declutter /more flat decor content I'm sure is in the works Attempting to keep a plant alive  Food prep ideas (I meal prep) : stir fry eg chow mein is super easy May other kind of curry Creamy pasta with mushrooms and ham Garlic spicy checkien with steamed broccoli/green beans and rice Dumplings in a spicy tomato sauce with mixed veggies Hints:I find if you cut all the veggies you need on mass and use similar ones, then make the meals and just switch up sauces it's easier to not get bored.
You can really bring the poundland series  we will live that
Hi Taz, I really love your videos and been watching them lately x I just want to give you an idea for the next videos and hope you would love to do it. How about you do Online Shopping such as Vinted. It might be different type of your videos, but I would love to hear from your opinion about it, cause this one makes me obsessed with and I must try to stop myself to spend more money for shopping from it xx
Taz, please consider Indian food for meal prep. The basic stuff like Dal, Rice, Sabji, and not the complicated stuff that restaurants make. Also, the primary "breads" in Indian food like Chapati or Paratha or Roti, you can find ready-to-heat at most Indian grocery stores. You just need to heat it on a pan and its ready to eat. Basic Indian food is very versatile, and it keeps for long in the fridge without needing to be frozen, because the spices and salt also act as a preservative. By versatile I mean that you can make little changes to the recipe, like substituting one kind of lentil for another when prepping Dal, and it will taste entirely different and new, and there are like 6-7 types of lentils that can be used to make Dal so you will need to repeat yourself only after 2 months.
Yay! I'm so happy for you! You got diagnosed! I have ADHD, I've never gotten diagnosed but all my sibling have it and I show signs of it. Honestly, for me, you'll just start checking yourself once you realize you have ADHD and it should get a little better. Keep being a queen!
Your rice cooker lookes like a small cute cauldron from the side...
Also side note for impulsively control, it differs based on the situation, but for verbal impulses, just remove yourself from the situation, physical impulses I don't fight much if they aren't hurting me or anyone else. You can only repress so many impulses through out the day
Hope ur adhd gets better🥺 Also I love ur meal prep vids 💞
I really like your meal prep videos
do eating different coloured foods for a week. eg. monday-blue tuesday-red etc😀
I recommend frozen blueberries and strawberries on your oatmeal too☺️You can mix it in with the oatmeal whilst it’s cooking to defrost it😊Packed with antioxidants and vitamin c.
On the plus side people with adhd do things in creative ways to get around doing things that are boring .plus your adhd probably helped you on YouTube , because your personality is not boring because your think so much and so fast. Adhd isn’t necessarily a disorder, it just depends on what you think order is . Lol
I've found that planning everything before starting with cooking helps a lot with multitasking. Just try to think of the steps that are common to the different dishes that you are planning to cook and try to club them together, so basically focus on one dish while prepping for the others. Hope that helps :)
Surely I didn't just watch taz not wash the rice... She washed it off camera right... RIGHT?!
Now that you have a rice cooker, you need to try cooking rice with KFC chicken in it!!!
Video ideas: 1. Learn a language for a week.  Maybe Japanese? (or use a language app for a month)   2. Play a popular computer game like the sims or something competitive if feeling it.   3. Use a meal prep service like hello fresh or something a bit different like the spicery (just sends spices, instructions, not the food).   4. Learn a new skill e.g. The guitar, painting   5. Get a gardening plot of land and do some gardening.   6. Make diy presents e.g. Jam, arty things.   7. Do challenge like 100 days of art (theres a few books to help with that).
Duh you have adhd . Lol I do too. I’m 29 and was diagnosed only last year.
Go on tiktok and look up meal prep plans u will literally find so much food to make that looks Amazing 🗣❤️
I’m I the only one that hates the taste of Roman
Taz you can find YouTube videos designed to help with meal prep ideas. Maybe use some of those for new meal inspo?
Finalllllly the video I was waiting for all week. Thankyou for making my day better taz🥺
Just so you know, adhd and autism go together a lot, and in women it's often missed, I'd be happy to send you some websites if you were curious, but I'm certainly not trying to diagnose you! I'm adhd and autistic, I was improperly diagnosed for a lot of things, finally got adhd, and self diagnosed Autism like six months later. I've just found that finding "labels" for my "defects" has helped me function easier
Taz, you can prepare porridge in an airfryer. I’m doing it like everyday or every other day. As you don’t like milk, you can use water or plant milk. 160 celsius degree, 7 minutes and done. Delicious. 🤗
taz, you're such an amazing person. thank you for opening up about what you're ashamed of. it is very difficult, but i get what you mean! i'm also very impulsive and sometimes i can't control my emotions, but i'm learning! as you said, we are human. thank you and wish you the best! saludos from argentina
I was just watching a blog a weeek old and this lady uploads with a fresh blog just made my day thank you 😊
Tips...for stale bread that's gone crisp...microwave wrapped in a damp paper towel, 1 through 2 minutes...should come out moist and soft. Also have brown sugar that's gone hard or to keep from getting hard...place the soft heels or ends of bread on top...it will make the brown sugar soft or keep it soft.💙
we love our bargains xx
1 HOUR AGO AND TAZ ILY<33333
How to ADHD IS A GOOD YOUTUBER
Can you try out hello fresh in a video??
Highly recommend Meal Prep King for recipe ideas! Also, recommend making 'fillings' instead of full meals. So if you make bolognese, then during the week you can have it with pasta on one day, add a bit of chilli and have it with rice the next, on a microwaved potato the next, or with cheese on some cheap wedges from aldi. You're a lot less likely to get sick of the meals this way and its really no extra effort.   PS. Air fryer salmon is delicious!
Your meal prep videos are golden!
A tip for people that are interested in meal prepping: prepare thinks like sauces, pickled vegetables, taco fillings etc. That way you can combine more (the sauce with noodles, taco fillings with rice, taco filling added to the sauce and rice) and the food will be less repetitive. Personally cooking up a fresh batch of noodles is pretty low key to me as long as I already have some great things prepared to eat with it.
Your facial expressions kill me
maybe do more than one option each meal a week not everyday like two options is great
maybe prep seasoning/ marinades for things like salmon. you have an air fryer now so you'd just have to pop the marinade on and throw it in there!
Hi Taz! I got diagnosed with ADHD 3 months ago and I recognized soooo much from myself in you. I’ve been following you for quite some time now and I always thought we were really similar in a lot of different areas. Welllll this explains it haha. Thanks for being so open about it and you are amazing as always!
you can make your quinoa in your rice cooker too!!
Congrats on 1.5million subscribers... way to 2mill
I’m here to offer more recipes that are vegan, big up the plants innit. All simple to make and under 20 minutes to make each one. Hope you enjoy Taz x
Oh and also vegetable fritters or stuffed potato cakes stuffed with wild mushrooms lol
Taz: listing all the symptoms that I have as well Me: hmmmmmmm 😳 maybe I need to get that checked out too 🙈
learn something new.  crafts, or make a new friend. Train to do a 5K something to get out of the house. Volunteer somewhere. do something that involves someone else.
I really wanna see another living on free food for a week 💜
Last night I had stuffed peppers that were stuffed with: green lentils, brown rice, white onion and you cook in like a bolognese sauce so tomato passata and tinned tomatoes and then seasoning like salt, pepper, curry powder, paprika, cumin, garlic, onion, tamari or soya sauce then you can stuff them into peppers and top with grated vegan cheese and herbs! Cook herbs into the mixture too. You could totally freeze that mixture then reheat and stuff into peppers! Also, you could make chickpea and sweet potato burgers! Lentil bolognese, you could make a smoky bean dish to put into baked potato as well
i love how adorable you are <3
You could try tiktok food trends  Or you could try recreating some of your favorite dishes from restaurants
One pot meals are also a good thing if you struggle with the multitasking aspect! You can find some good ones. Curries are very good for a lot of these.
Well impulsiveness maybe try to think of the process of the idea and still see if your willing to do it
Reishunger, a German brand I didn't think I'd see in a taz video :D now I want to buy the rice cooker as well, but I already have so many kitchen devices Q_Q
If you cook your rice with coconut water it gives it a great flavor.
next do organic meal prep! no budget, you can afford to take the best care of your body <3 also pre-prep before cooking. leave the recipe instructions on the table, set out all your ingredients (cut/chopped/measured) on the table neatly, so when you're ready to cook all you need to do is turn the heat on and start! also for impulsiveness, meditation. meditation twice a day, 20min each. find a transcendental meditation center near your location and they will teach you the way.  next recipe you should try: https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/red-lentil-dal-coconut-milk-and-kale
I KNOW SHE SAYS DONT GET ATTACHED BUT SORRY I AM THO <3
I recommend watching a video on how to handle a knife properly. Watching you using it like that gave me anxiety. Please don't cut your fingers. >.<
Video idea - wear clothes from different countries for a week .
2:49 hahaha
God is blessing you ^_^
Where's the bargain in taz's merch?
Omg, I just got my ADHD diagnosis as an adult too and I feel you so so much!!! Life just makes sense now 😂❤️
I’d love to see you try a new hobby every week like....junk journaling, rock climbing, Pokemon go, gardening, roller skating... the list goes on. You could go and talk to someone who already does the hobby, find out what kind of people do it, what the YouTube community is like, learn a bit about its history or whatever..and the DO IT. For a week. You might discover something new you like, and we might discover something we want to try! Win win! ✌️❤️ x
Oh fuck. I looked it up and I probably have adhd myself. This is ... a revelation.
Legit love your videos. Your poor cooking makes my husband and I laugh as he is exactly the same. Never give up trying!! ❣❣❣
Either chop or blitz the onion and freeze them, that way you're sorted for even longer with onions.
Next time, just peel, cut, and freeze any bananas that need to be eaten right away. Then use them in smoothies, baking, or for banana ice cream (just put some frozen bananas in a blender with milk or vegan milk) and it's like ice cream
Can you please make a video on tips and advice for moving out. Can you talk about all the difficulties that you faced and what things we should keep in mind.
Meanwhile I wish I was more impulsive
It's been a while since you made some clothing/styling videos.
Lolll to the onions 🤣🤣🤣 don't manifest too hard people! ❤️ Aw love Taz
One tiny tip for your pasta, might be a tad bit more work, but it will taste better I promise! Just make your pasta sauce during meal prep and during the week when you wanna eat pasta, just cook your pasta (takes 5 mins, so come on!) and add the sauce to hot, freshly cooked pasta!
at 6:20 i thought it was gonan be some hellofresh ad
Bts favorite meals for a week/24 hours
Oh boy so i probably have adhd, my sister probably have adhd, my friends might have it as well and almost everyone i personally know
If you want ideas for recipes go check the 3 ingredients playlist from Barry Lewis, those recipes are very easy, require few ingredients and I think some might work well with meal prep!
Get the book Seriously Good Freezer Meals taz! I would love to see you do this more often. Love you ❤
If you chop all the bananas now and freeze them then you can take out what you want when you want and they thaw quickly too
You can make the porridge more interesting by putting oil, mustard seeds, onions, tomatoand green Chilli, then put the water and the mix.
Love the mealprep recipes of pick up limes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu5yeOxjPXs
9:36 better to have veg fresh.    **Continues to grab a pack of frozen vegetables😂**
I hope she’s reusing those plastic boxes because they’re a lot of waste
Check out Julia Pacheco’s channel, she has a few meal prepping videos.
Taz has me now thinking I have ADHD. Both my kids have a severe case of ADHD and my oldest a milder case. So would make sense. I DEF know we have sensory issues. I should get tested for that. Especially since now my kid even said she thinks I have that. Don't try and feel bad. Something I'm ashamed about is the same as yours. I actually hurt people's feelings being so honest. I try so hard NOT to be this way but it just comes out my mouth.
Read into indigo adults , people are often misdiagnosed with adhd but in fact are indigos
Try to prep “Parmigiana di melanzane “ it’s a lasagna but with aubergine instead of lasagna sheets. The more it’s stays in the freezer the better it is. I can give you the recipe. I can bet £20 you will looooove it
You still got a law degree with high marks ... And you didn't enjoy it. So you're really strong. Though it did make you spiral. Happy you got a diagnosis, having a name for something can make a big difference
16.27 Use smoked salmon.
I personally love avantgardevegan's meal prep videos! they're really good and he makes sure to include all the nutrients needed in every meal, I think you might enjoy those recipes 😼❤
Working from home, slow cooker recipes could be a good idea. You just wack everything in and leave it going in the background.
Sending you love from  🇲🇾 Malaysia, Taz!! ❤️❤️ been watching you since day one and your vids has always made my day better!
"I manifested too hard" would look sick on a tee.
As you just got an Airfryer I highly suggest you make roasted potato in it, and I also love doing fries (the ones you get frozen) and onion rings as well.  A tip for multitask cooking is actually use the Airfryer to cook some of your dishes (you can basically cook anything in it, look it up and you'll be surprised) I like cooking meat in it, you just put your spices and airfry it, but you can put some veggies together, gives it a really nice flavor, for ex. Chicken thighs, potatoes and broccoli... You can use your imagination and experiment, you'll probably end up enjoying cooking really soon 🥰
9:20 tell that to Gordon Ramsey. 😐
I figured I have adhd too and I'd really be grateful if u spoke more abt ur adhd and help us fellow adhders
Salmon drizzle with olive oil, season with oregano & chilli flakes and pop in a foil parcel. Pop it in the oven for 10 mins at 200C and it's delish.
Hi Taz, I’m not sure if you have done a video like this in the past but I think that maybe you could do a video on trying small and affordable  businesses would be a cool idea. xx
Something about this makes me satisfied.
Slow cookers are great for bulk cooking/ meal prep- you can find loads of meal ideas if you google slow cooker recipes and most of them you literally just Chuck everything in and set it off to cook!
You can probably make 3-4 different type of sauces and then when you have to eat, either add veg to it, or meatballs or even pasta!   Also, you can make patties and freeze : not just meat ones, even lentils or veg ones freeze well! Just thaw them and (air) fry!
Can u do " eating only fruits for 24 hours" ??? Plz?
Found your apartment video yesterday and immediately subbed. Your personality is so bubbly and fun :)
Try the sorted meal packs app, maby that can help you with recipes and I'v been curious for a while
Might recommend this to my boyfriend when he lives on his own. He also has ADHD and i've seen so many people talking about the 'procrastinating eating/cooking until nauseous from hunger' thing. Maybe this would be a good idea for him too.
Taz ur manifestations are happening, pls manifest that I can see you one day.
I get alot of inspiration from freezer meal videos and sheet pan videos.
Tips for meal planning: Don’t be hard on yourself if you fall short of your cooking goals, any prep you do is a win. Play your favourite music at high volume (with earphones if you have neighbours ☺️). Keep a couple of easy cook prepackaged freezer foods for the days when you hate your own food, or give yourself permission for takeout. I cook multiple types of food rather than “meals” so that I can pick and choose. So let’s say I have cooked tofu, baked root vegetables, salad, and several different pasta dishes ready, I may take a bit of each in one meal or just eat only one. Depends on the day.  I make up a couple of different sauces that can be used on a variety of dishes, like a cashew sauce or a garlic avocado sauce or just a plain white sauce. They keep surprisingly well and spice up a dish without extra effort.
Piece your bananas and keep it in fridge 💯
Hi taz, when you are afraid you are getting bored of things you can also mealprep in a different way. I know rainbowplantlife makes meal prep videos where they prep a bunch of foods, like 8 staples, but then put them  together in different ways so it still feels like you are eating different meals, but without the hassle of cooking everything seperately. This youtube channel I mentioned is vegan, but you can ofcourse adjust it to your preferences. I hope this helps😊
You can buy frozen microwave salmon and just meal prep the stuff to go with it
So, for the salmon you can get aluminum foil, season it,wrap it up and just pop it in the oven for 10-15 minutes. if you didn’t want to season it before freezing it you can just defrost it, season, wrap it up and pop it into the oven.
Off topic but your flat is looking great!
I would have bought a pressure cooker/ instant pot instead of a rice cooker they are better and you can cook more meals
Try indian food for ur meal plan
You should plan things before handed to avoid problems between multi tasking
I want money to buy the purple hoodiee 😭😭😭  Also, it’s so Taz to eat fresh vegs and procced to cook frozen veg 😂
Look at us being early!
I'm exactly the same with shopping and cooking. Don't do it. My meals are all straight out of the packet or heated in the microwave 🤔
Taz you should not open the boiled eggs if you wont eat it straight away. Cook them, leave it in your fridge for 7 days max and only open it before you meal. The shell protects your egg from any bacteria or smell in your fridge.
People living alone mostly ignore preparing food. That may affect one's health.
Hey there Taz AKA my top fav YouTuber ❤️ You asked for ideas so here's one 💡 - *'Finding out my MBTI personality'*  I am really into this thing, I tell everyone close to  me to tell me their type, it's not to be judgemental but it's just fun sometimes 😂. Since I love love love you , it would be fun to see you test yourself ❤️  Love from India ! 🇮🇳
My husband with ADHD can't multitask when he cooks either.  Recently he's started using alarms on his phone to help him keep some scheduling in his life, and it's been going really well. He has an 11pm alarm when he takes his pills, and then reads for an hour before bed. He's also started stretching and eating breakfast every morning. His mood improved so much. His ADHD craves structure, but also rails against it.
Anyone got a recipe for that chickpea spinach curry? Kinda wanna try it but the search result is overwhelming
Think you and Grackle would be a meal match made in heaven ..... get her to sort you out a weekly menu and show you cheat hacks in how to put it together
Guys, any music recommendations??
for the question... im not ashamed because yk trying to make sure no one's opinion like makes me upset but like yk how you have that one friend yeahhhhhhh ion have one and like me and my supposed bff don't talk so yeahhh. I hate how everyone likes making me realize that like it already hard for me but anyway... i mean don't get me wrong I'm striving and everything is going great but sometimes you just someone to talk to and be open with just yeahhh.  omfg i hope someone gets me. lol.
I never seen you try out tik tok recipes (or maybe i missed it if u have) maybe that would be a good idea for a next video....maybe do it with moon love the humor when you two are together👌
I got diagnosed with ADHD at 27. And it has changed the way i tackle life already!!  I'm happy for you!! 💕
I think the most I'm ashamed about is how I don't believe in myself and love myself when my friends and family try really hard to help me with
i swear you change your diet almost every 2 weeks 😭
Can you do a video about dressing like a certain aesthetic every day for a week? Like egirl one day, Lolita the next etc.. 🥰
This makes so much sense! For a while I had thought you would maybe be autistic (hehe that's me🙈), but some things just didn't line up. But ADHD and autism are in a lot of ways similar as well.   Video idea: maybe you could make a video about ADHD, your process and how it impacts you?
Awww sooo glad you are getting help for your ADHD ❤️❤️❤️ Also great for you to be open and honest about it and raise awareness
You should get a slow cooker and recipe book, they are so good for batch cooking
TAZ!! I thought we agreed this did but work out the last time 🥲
Heres my favorite meal on the cheap! Its Spicy Chicken Ramen. I cook in a pan, pre-half-cooked fajita chicken from the store, but any cheap pieces of chicken (or just ex the chicken out all together!) in the pan with seasoning. Ill either cook the bell pepper separately or with the chicken, just till they both are very obviously cooked. I then cook chicken ramen, but instead of only the ramen seasoning packet, I put in crushed red pepper flakes, a bit of soy sauce and a bit of onion powder.  I then slice some green onion and put that on the side while everything is cooking. When done, you can basically just throw it all together! Its my favorite way to cook ramen so far and is pretty cheap!
I WANNA BE UR BEST FRIEND SO BAD ILY /p
I got quite a lot of people with ADHD in my family, not direct family but cousins etc. And you are so far from them in all possible ways I'm actually shook that you'd score high on the test or whatever they did :P
Her merch is the best ngl
A day eating Bolivian food/meals
I would have done Pasta Sauce alone instead of Pasta Sauce with the Pasta mixed in. That way I could use the sauce with pasta and change the pasta noodle, sauce with toast, sauce with rice (cheese baked rice). ❤️
Only a suggestion: wash your rice to remove the starch (until the water is clear). Tastes better IMO, less starchy and doesn’t stick together if cooked right😁  Looks delicious though!!
LOVE the Wales jersey! Everyone in the UK will be able to hear me cheering from Canada tomorrow...GO LIONS!
Hey taz love ur content ❤️❤️ so as u were asking to what to shoot u can do follow the morning routine of certain types of like famous celebrity its actually kinda trending these days 👍👍👍oh and btw if you want to read a book then go for inner engineering it is new Bestseller 👍👍❤️😘
You could travel to switzerland one day and film a challenge where you try to live on a budget. It would be interesting to see how you would navigate that,as it is one of the most expensive countries in the world :)💙
I would love to see ‘A day in the life of Taz’ because I feel like people think that YouTube vids pay the bills but I feel like obvs there’s more behind the scene and would be great to get a little insight!
If you add cinnamon on your banana oatmeal it would taste super amazing.
you should do another video surviving of £1 for a day challenge
Does anyone just watch for Taz's cute soothing voice?
There's a channel here on YT called How to ADHD that explains how ADHD can effect different aspects of your life and gives some insight on ways to deal with it.  Video idea: Styling your existing wardrobe in new ways.   Meal Prep Tip for variety: Pre-make or prep components instead of whole meals. If you have a bunch of roasted veg, pre-chopped raw veg, cooked chickpeas or tofu, cooked rice, and some raw salmon or chicken in the fridge, you can combine them in different ways or with different sauces and only have to do minimal cooking from day to day. It can be easy like a sandwich or salad with some dressing or salmon and rice with the pre-roasted veg, or you can just grab the prepared ingredients from your chopped raw veg and some chicken and throw it all in the pan to do a stir fry, or a pot with some canned broth to make soup. Also, crock pots/slow cookers can be your best friend. There's a million recipes for slow cookers that you just throw all the ingredients in, turn it on, and leave it to do its thing for a few hours. Then, you have a big batch of something with practically no effort. Chili is easiest in a slow cooker, imo.
keema pie & veg is really nice, it’s like a curry flavoured Shepard’s pie made with sweet potato and it’s really easy to make and so yummy!!!
how about diifferent types of food from diff countries per week?
you should paint that kitchen
Bestie I feel this so much, getting my adhd screening at the end of this month hahaha, especially the memes I saw made me worry lol
how did you defrost the food, did you microwave it? or like keep out from the night before, etc
When boiling eggs as a meal prep, why do you peel them? They come pre wrapped after all :-)
You can try meal prepping omelets like saute veggies and then making the egg fresh every morning
have you tried hello fresh or similar, it might make the experience of cooking better for you!
I like the tree in the background? Is it real or artificial?
I cried soooo much watching fatherhood
Meals prep ideas: make taco stuffing and when you wanna eat it heat up a tortilla n bammm a burrito 😂 -••quinoa salads aree yumm with chickpeas •• sweet n sour chicken with rice•• grilled chicken with the veggies and mash potatoessss••thai style noodles•• I hope these were helpful and it’s 5am in Fiji so my brains a lil wonky lol. I love you taz stay safe okay <3
I have that air fryer!!! Love it. Not a fryer before at all, now I use it once a week minimum.
taz i haven't watched u in a while. I watched u 2 years ago and im so proud that ur doing so much better. U look so much happier! I hope u keep being happy
You should get a Crock-Pot. They sell liners for them as well so cleanup is super easy. Love your content!
you could try making the porridge with some milk! for example half of the liquid amount you use oat milk and half just water, it’s so much better
OOOH THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE SHE HAS ADHD I HAVE IT TOO AND ALWAYS RELATED TP HER SO MUCH
i was born with ADHD and it is a bastard of a thing at times but hey thats life
The chickpea and spinach curry looks good. I'm going to add that to my cooking Playlist 👍🏾
Hi taz, I just want to say thank you for getting me though my isolation I swear you are the only person I have been watching!!! Thxs
Hey Taz what about an experimaental day routine in which you just try living a day completely against your normal day. great video btw. ly

Still waiting for the next poetry video, tho i cant stop myself from watching literally ANYTHING she uploads❤️
Could you try foreign dishes for your next video?
In the AM I never think about the PM meals, usually just eat when hunger kicks in.
kinda wanna check if i have adhd or not now
The things you have said about ADHD, procrastination, can't make yourself do anything productive and being impulsive. I relate to all of them, im not sure if i have it or not
Uncle Roger would proud :)
If it's not Taz then  I dont know...Taz at it again
i’m ashamed with the way that i can’t let go of the past^^
hi,I recommend what works for me but sorting the things you need before cooking is better because you’ll worry less about chopping them up or rushing to put them when you’re cooking.
Other ideas sweet and sour dish , carbonara , tuna pasta , chicken curry , lentil curry , black bean and corn salad
I am so proud of myself for being early
So does taz have adhd?x
The bye in the end of every video is what I wait for 😉 and how much she has grown ...it's so cute ... How many of you agree ...taz I have been following you since 3 years .....
Aldi is cheaper than lidl
there's no beans on toast??? is this really taz???
I am ashamed of how much boring and kind of selfish I am
Gurl write it on paper what you are gonna cook on how many degrees for how many minuts  multiple timers (app)and it will reduce the stress love your viddss xxxxx
Taz videos is the only thing I bingewatch nowadays
"We have been artificially blessed" 😂
taz you should try a baking video. would love to see that
Love prep vids
FUNFACT- *SHE IS COOLER THAN YOUR AC😎*
Thank you for being one of the realest people ever, most youtubers and content creators feel the need to put up a front. You are true to yourself and honestly it so refreshing❤️❤️
Congratulations on your diagnosis. I was diagnosed in uni and it really changed my life. It's good to know that it's not you being lazy or not trying hard enough but that your brain is literally making everything more challenging for you and that you deserve to cut yourself some slack.  Because, as we know, people with ADHD tend to be their own worst critics and we tend to suffer from pretty low self esteem.  But it's all good. Apparently we're great at creative jobs 😊  BTW look op the YouTube channel "how to ADHD" if you haven't already.  They're great and have super helpful tips. They're also super cute and will make you happy 😊
maybe try the hello fresh thing idk if its in the uk but it does seem like a solid option, if its not in the uk just go take one of their recipes and make that if you like it.
TAZ, YOU NEEEEEED A NINJA FOODI! look them up, they do everything!!
You can cook quinoa in the rice cooker btw
💜💜
Love you taz... hey why not try vending machine foods 😋
this video just proves that Taz is a child of Apollo..... just saying
im like reall early omgg
label the container before freezing so you know what's inside! also if prepping for a whole weeks gets too overwhelming, cook like multiple portions of one meal and eat it the following days
be careful to not eat too much spinach though, because your forearms will get huge.
🇱🇧 love from lebanon !! ❤️❤️ Such a unique youtuber :)
Get tested for vitamin D, been saying this for ages, it can present same symptoms as ADHD. Figure out the basics first, like diet, environment, lifestyle and sleep etc. before being ‘diagnosed’ with something.
put the onion in the freezer for like 10 or 15 minutes before cutting to stop the crying. it stops the stuff in the air that makes you cry
Always eagerly awaiting your next video.....All the way from South Africa😊
Loooks 👍
Yessss
Adhd is such a struggle.multi tasking is setting I think I'm good at but I am not. It's hard with adhd because we get distracted a lot by little things.
I've been following you for around 2 years and absolutely love your channel and seeing you grow while staying yourself :)
Literally taz made my day  She uploaded a video Yay!!
This moring while watching a different video of yours i thought dose anyone else think taz had adhd  20 minutes later  Oppens newest video.  Taz "i have adhd" Me 😂😂😂😂😂 i knew it
I am really happy that you're are finally getting professional help that you need and deserve. We love to see Taz with better mental and physical health 💜
Taz! For Multi-tasking with food you should think of what your making and think of what you can make with any leftovers or purposely make too much and use the leftovers as another meal, add more spices! Different sauces etc just an easy way of making 2 meals at once without all the pots n pans :)
Top tip when peeling the egg shell. Peel the shell inside the COLD water. Its more effective than peeling the shell outside.
This vide has everything I love in it. Airfryer, wonky veg box, cheap meals and Taz.
