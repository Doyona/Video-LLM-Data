Mike and Zach do what now?
most convincing thumbnail i have ever seen
The takes... help 😭
**Rolls Eyes** 🙄😒 Oh my god Mike…~
zach dosen't even understand about ''beat it''
Uh...
1:50 is my favourite one
This is comedy gold
I have to fight the urge to use the extra bit as notification sounds
Beat it
So imagine that but you learning and living in Germany or Chinese. Yyyyyyyyeah, it's that lvl of complicated.
Beat it
0:47 bro Cant catch a hint for his life
"Beat" is said 30 times in this skit😭😭
This is not what I expected from my for you page
"BEAT WHAT?!" *calm voice* "MY ME-"
Lowered my expectations then rose them back up
this feels like adult eddsworld
Why is YouTube recommending this during NNN
Aw man i was hoping he actually beat it on camera 😕
Zach is too innocent for this😭
I was like “ oh I’m dirty minded” so I was like watching it so I was like…. “Oh they beat the song!”, “ why are there tissues? To wipe their sweat ir smth?”
Stop
WHAT THE FUCK
Bro sounds like Joe from family guy 1:13
first youtube video thats better without sound
My god he’s beating to yiff (furry porn)…
Beat calmy
...I..  why did.. im so cooked
“If you wanna be a man (just beat it)” -MJ
Such a direct message
0:55 “MY MEAT” ayo?
BEAT WHAT???????????????????????????????????????????????????????
"MY MEAT" 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
Got sent this by a friend and felt an Ominous Wind when I saw the website on his computer. Horrific.
0:45 🤨    Thats a... Pretty specific site...
I’m gonna beat it
0:58  don’t worry he was talking about the meat in his fridge <:)
Knew it was not weird
0:45 iykyk
i swear i have stage 19.268924 brainrot, everytime i hear "Beat it," i go "WHAT"
Oh! Good thing to see on my fyp at 12:13 am!
Neighbors be running to the moving van as fast as possible
Make and zack what
0:44 e621 is crazy
i said "THE MICHEAL JACKSON SONG,RIGHT?"
“Throws some bread”
(1:00): ..this reminds me of eddsword for some reason— maybe because of his face.
You know, I thought this like two years ago and it is freaking funny just beat it 👏👏👏👏👏👏 0:39
Just beat it, just...            Don't eat it
Why is this only getting recommended to me now?
0:43 it is confirmed: mike is a furry
Tag...YOU'RE IT!!!!!!!
wild thumbnail and title
i love beating it
AYOOOO- (GIBBERISH SOUND)
i actually thought they were gonna talk about micheal jackson prior to clicking on this
Release the extended cut *coward*
When i think of "Mike and Zach' I think of those two veterans who play fallout together. They would do this.
that was the best thumbnail you couldve picked
That Spyro has.... Has seen some stuff. Stuff which no amount of gems, butterflies, or roasting Gnastys nasties will ever help to ease the emotional trauma of.
Should i draw it in another way? 1:11  The way he said my meat when zach said he is going to beat his meat i wonder what will it look like
Well that was confusing
0:47 the way he makes the face “🤨”
AHHH ROBIN! YAYYAYAYAYAYYAYAYA IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE VID WITH HIM
wot
0:22 “SCRAM! GET OUT OF HERE” says it to “bad user”
0:24 lol?
0:23 message to “bad user)

This whole video is worse if you close your eyes
e621 is crazy the furry shit is amazing
The fact that half of this video is outtakes is a testament to how absurd this video is
I saw e621 on his PC bro
"MY P3N1S!!!!!" ........ "Ahhhhh....." Got Me.
At the end it kind of sounds like "My waiter".
Look at the plushies on his bookcase
The website was up for a split second and i instantly recognized it. I might have a problem.
ok that was good!
E621, im proud of mike ❤
0:55 MY MEAT.
0:55 1:18 MY MEAT!
0:55 MY MEAT!!!‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
NOT THE E621 ON THE DESKTOP
Huh didn’t expect to see e621
the way he opened e621 😭
Oral's bet- I mean Eat It by Weird Al Yankovic is better
e621... ough
What are we exactly beating?
MY MEAT🔥🔥🔥
0:44 D:
Beat it Feat It 😏😏
Mike: MY MEEAT!!!! 0:55
I love that song from Michael Jackson Beat It

Mike hitting his keyboard and summoning the salt website fucking floored me
0:55 Mike MY MEAT!
Beat what MY MEAT me 😂😂😂 I😂😂😂😂😂
MY MEAT!! -Dumbledore said calmly
never realize the tag your it joke till now. XD
Is that Robin in the back laughing his ass off to those outtakes
0:45 is this a website for [not PG-13, therefore this comment would be deleted by youtube]?
0:38 Spyro the dragon?
Ive watched this video like 10 times and i just got the tag your it joke
is the thumbnail really necessary?
I came into this PREPARED
0:45 The e621 reference 🌹❤️‍🩹
is no one going to comment of the fact that he said "beat it" and and mike said "please do"
1:51 😂😂😂😂😂
0:45 Yep, definitely furry.
I just realized Mike was going on e621.
If I EVER make an indie show I’m ending an episode like this 1:09
What the hell did I just watched 😂
Did it seriously take me 2 years to realize what site Mike clicked on?! 😂😂😂
yeah, piemations is a furry
sump man
"Who's on first" in the 21st century
Love the but with him opening e621 on his desktop
when I saw E621 pop up I went “wait, Mike’s a furry?” then I remembered the MLP animations
I’m so glad I started watching you again I haven’t laughed this hard in a while
The title and thumbnail is JUST DIABOLICAL 😭😭😭
Zach: I really wanna hear you yell my weiner Mike: yells my weiner Zach: doesnt gaf
I KNEW Mike was a furry >:3c
​​​ (SapDavRock:) ​Uhh... ​ ​​​​ ​♪ No one wants to be defeated? ♪​ ​​  ​​​(Sara:)  ​No! Beat it!​ ​​  (SapDavRock:) Beat- BEAT WHAT?​ ​​  ​​​(Sara:) MY MEAT!​ ​​​​ ​[SapDavRock laughing]​    🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wtf
0:48 gay vibes
Not the yiff...
Why did I only laugh at the outstakes LMFAO
The fact e621 showed up on the screen is hilarious! XD
So Mike is canonically a furry lol.
Emkay moment
0:45 is that…
Skim milk the sequel
"MY PEINIS"

That website-
I cannot relate to this for one reason
He Just Had To Beat It.
0:45 e621 is wild
MY MEAT
I'm beating it right now 😏

This is just a recreation of “  Skim milk “
Imagen if suction cup man was in the original family guy 1:25
Why the thumnail? 💀💀💀
e621 😭
Zach: "Mike, I can help you beat it" Suction Cup Man: "That sounds very suggestive"
🏳️‍🌈? 0:36
my face when esix showed man
When I try to tell my friend something and the class goes quiet
Let's all ignore e621 on the computer
E621 shoutout XD
Cringe
Love how half of this episode is just MY MEAT
Why does “tag, your it… *aggressive punch*” seem like something eddsworld would do with Tom and/or Tord
Beat it song is Reference to "Michael Jackson" used in Piemations video
ok quick pause, why did he open up e621
Ohhh so the thumbnail gave it away he actually was gonna beat it
can you believe *this* is what peak comedy looks like?
MY SHLONG
1:50 i love how you can hear laughter in the background after zach says that
M̵͉̓Y̴͇̏ ̴̙͆F̴̜͆A̴͙̕T̶͚̒ ̵̢͘F̵̖͒Ŭ̷̪C̸̠̀K̸͖̐I̴͕̾N̸̩̒G̶̮̐ ̴̖̌C̶̢̐O̷͈̅C̸͈̾K̵̡̀
What showed up on Mike’s screen was pure evil
-Beat what?.. -Beat ur ass boi!
I DIDN'T EXPECT E6 I'M FUCKING DYINGGGGGGGGGGGGG LMAOOOO
0:28 found the thumbnail lol
I knew they were gonna make the joke I just wasn’t sure how direct they were gonna get I definitely didn’t expect him to just outright say he’s gonna beat his meat
😂so good but so dum
MY MMMMMMMMEAT
The fact that it was E621 is crazy bro 😭
drake be like
Seeing Spyro figurine - ah, so cute! Seeing e621 - oh... Oh, no...
HOLD UP!!! E621?!?? LMFAO!!!

😂
I just now noticed, the song in the beginning is "Beat it" by Michael Jackson
Why does Mike have a picture of Caseoh lmaoo
I was on E621 while watching this 🤣🤣🤣
Now I’m going to beat it, Tag you’re it… comedy perfection
😂😂😂 “the cock and ballz” killed me at the end
Jesus fucking christ hahahahahahahahahaha 0:33 zachs reaction killed me
Mike: *Wakes up*  Ralof: “Hey, you.” “You’re finally awake.”

The tag, You're it, thing was funny.
The neighbors: D:
Zach: "tag, YOU´RE IT" *proceeds to beat it*
0:45 i know e621 when i see it
Wait a minute... Who's on first?!?
Mike and Zach engaging in the pronoun game.
WILD THUMBNAIL
He stopped him 😁👍
so does this mean mike is canonically a furry?
hell nah e6 XD
e621 is a nice touch lmao
your poor neighbors  😭😭
I love it how the song ends exactly at the 7 second mark for copyright
1:52 I love how you can hear someone laughing in the background in between the takes
"MY MEAT" Dumbledore said calmly.
"tag, YOU'RE IT!!!🔥"
1:45 I LOVE HOW YOU CAN HEAR FAINT GIGGLES IN THE BACKGROUND
e621 popping up wasnt expected
alternate title: *2 dudes screaming about meat for 2 minutes*
I have the credit audio set as my phone ringtone. It's been two years and I still look forward to being called
Just love the e621 website that popped up when he hit his keyboard. Honestly never expected that and totally off guard. Very good animation 👍
“MY MEAT” dumbledoor said calmly
Zach: I DON'T KNOW WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mike: I'M GOING TO BEAT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Zach: BEAT!?! WHAT?!!!!!!!! Mike: MY MEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 0:50
The credits got me dying
yeah thats my favorite mascot as well good taste
*MY MEAT!!*

I hope there will be more episodes of the Mike and Zach series
0:44 No fucking way XD
00:55 MY 🥩!!!😡😡
Is Mike a furry??
MY PEANIS
weenor
0:45  this right here is gonna be my new desktop photo.
I instantly recognized e621 lol
*when someone takes tag too far* 1:12
Yeah Beat it is a pretty good song       Nothing could beat it
e621
*slams the desk* *e621 opens* please never change piemations, please never change
Out of all websites he could've beat it too.
1:23
this is my favorite mike and zach short (NOT BECAUSE OF QHAT YOU THINK IT IS SHJSHS) because i love the expression in this exact video. they move like 10x more and their faces look so silly in every shot, it's very mesmerizing to see how expressive every second of this video is lmao
Real
0:29 thumbnail
Did bro just go on e621 💀🙏🏽
the thumbnail is crazy
😂😂😂😂
God i love e621
I wonder if that can top off Calliope Mori's "Deadbeats jerk it now"
I will use the computer at 0:45 as evidence whenever someone denies that this is a furry channel.
beat does not sound like a word anymore
I JUST NOTICED E621 ON HIS LAPTOP LMFAO
0:55   2:08 2:13 2:15
im sorry when he banged his desk did that say E621?!?!?!?1
Actually this song was originally taken from Michael Jackson
The owner of e621 is a zoophile btw 😔
zach is so innocent
i was laughing hysterically the first time i watched this
For those who dont understand,this is about masturbating
0:29 pause here
Is zach voiced by Damien lee?
"What is that, a game?" got me dead
E621 reference, W
*BEAT IT*
What the hell did Mike go to
0:29 thumbnail
I hate that i know that website
Best animation ever
Zach’s calm response and then Mike saying he didn’t want to know Zach would “beat it” even thought he just yelled it at the top of his fucking lungs
Bro e6 just opening on the computer killed me
"Tag" "YOU'RE IT"
Imagine if south park animation was like that
😂😂😂 I'm dying here. Save me
I've never known this animation's humor when i was a bit younger.
Gotta love 2 guy's just screaming "MY MEAT" over and over
"Beat what?" "The skim milk!"
I think it was fate that I watched this, as I planned on beating it tonight
Piemations! Yeahhh!
Zach should have beat it
Erm, what the sigma
FAVORITE WEBSITE MENTIONED
It’s referring to me beating “it”, and by “it” well heh…. I mean my…. my peanits…
IS THAT CASEOH ON THE PAINTING!?😲😲
I like that Zach actually looked up for a split second before Mike did, he really was just thinking that as well
I just noticed that he opened up e621 💀
“Im going to do a few more my meats” funniest  shit I’ve ever heard
🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The e621 screen on the monitor was just perfect.
Zach’s blank expression had me rollin 💀
I just realized mikeburnfire is a patreon supporter, that's amazing
BEAT IT.
What is that, a game?
1:11 "when you try to make a gay joke but it backfires horribly" XD
e621??????
the website on the computer💀💀
The mini caseoh on the background: 💀
0:44 IS THERE SOMTHING YOU NEED TO SHARE!?!??!?
"Im gonna beat it." it seems mike defiantely was it.
Knuckle sandwich
The most replayed is the e621 on the monitor lmao
this man is.. what i expect of my fellow americans
the word "beat" is said 29 times in this video
e621… man why
——    ——    0        0     ———
Admittedly, I do really like Beat It x Industry Baby (please misinterpret this as wildly as possible)
“I can’t beat anything until you BEAT IT!” *opens e621* “What is that? A game?”
Funny thing the video is 2 minutes
the best piemations animation so far
Nothing sexual here youtube
Hold on why does piemations know E621
MY MEAAAT
All I can say is that they knew what they were doing with the thumbnail😭
i love how his art style has changed over the years. its gotten more complex and advanced but you can still see the original south park inspiration
"MY MEAT" Said the man ferociously
upload another episode.
Can Make a suction cup Man video again
I understood this to quickly.
E621 lmao
the thumbnail bro
Good to see he was going to get his monosodium glutamate :D
Am i the only one who saw the Todd and Shawn plushes in Mikes shelf
The e621 refernce 😭
*You asked for it now im gonna beat it*  -Meat
peakness
“ YOU WANNA HELP ME BEAT IT!? “ -Mike 2022
Well, that escalated quickly.
WHAT??????? THEY ARE GAY??????????????????????
whaaaat E621 Fuck it yea 0:45 OMG MICK IS FURRY
Mike:”MY MEAT!!!” Zach:👁️👄👁️
momento menos pajin de todos:
This generations who's on first
Good shit.
I wonder how funny it is for those that voice act for the animations Piemations make.
0:44 thats literally just the actual Websites home page WTF?   not a bad choice of beat material though
Micheal Jackson Beat it Beat it Beat it Beat it No One Wants Too be Defeated 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That thumbnail😭
The E621 reference was crazy 😂
Lation causally implies hes circumcised. Just thought I should put that image in someone's head
NOT E621 LMAO

i edge to this
His neighbors have so many questions. 😂  Honey, whats for dinn--- M Y  M E A T
"What are you going to beat?!" *"M Y M E A T!!!!"*

1:08 I love how Mike looks down here
"Tag. You're it!"
MY MEAT!
Pff....i'v seen cooler songs
Just wondering, what is the image on the screen
The rage is his voice is sending me 1:49 😂😂
WHY ARE YOU ON E621!?!? MILE?!
I gave you a like on this video for not censoring the word "penis"
Make a show of suction cup man
🧍🏻 real
Love the spyro figurine in the background
This shit is awesome
The "Tag, you're it" line at the very end is so brilliant.
I was a kis watching piemasons and did not understand this until now
I never realized how NSFW this video was 💀
1:16 my favorite part
Huh... I never noticed in the Patreon supporters thing at the end that Mikeburnfire is there... Neat
Tag... 😤 YOU'RE IT!!! 😡
doesn't look like he's beating it to that site anymore 😅
The plushies of Todd and Shaun in the Background
"What is that? A game?" OH YOU SWEET SUMMER CHILD
Hmm yes mssturbation jokes
Ah yes, e621. A man of good taste.
would've been funny if he just pulled out a steak and started punching it
when i saw e621 i lost my mind lMAO
1:08 green screen pls
I yelled so loud my ears popped. I died. 😂
*This video inspired me to beat it*
the e621 homescreen on the computer is wild
0:44 Lmao
I like to imagine each time they do something like this, it takes them so many damn retakes without bursting into laughter.
HE FUCKING OPENS E621 I AM DYING
NOT E621💀
Pulling up e621 is so real
Isn’t it lovely how a half of the entire video is just Mike and Zach screaming „MY MEAT” and „MY WEINER”
BROOOO FUCKING E6 HAHAHAHA 😂😂😂 IM LAIGHOHNG MY ASS OFF
This is arguably the unfunniest video you’ve ever done for your channel.
we haven't had Zach and Mike in over a year....... we need more >:c
They picked the best frame for the thumbnail 😂😂😂
"MY MEAT"
I just counted how many times they both said ‘Beat It’. 17-18 times
Who’s on beat it
e621 what a cultured man
"IM GONNA BEAT IT!" "MY MEAT" oh my god 💀
Tag ur it
💀💀💀💀💀💀
NOT THE WEBSITE TAB LMFAOO
I'm 100% Sure cooking steak 😁👍
Im surprised I never realized it but Mike and Zach support Mike and Zach. Which Zach is spelt the same way... hmmmmmmmm
"MY MEAT!!!"   *Zach regretting his life choices*  Amazing, now Zach'll learn to beat it.
as soon as he pulled out the fucking tissues i knew he was gonna 31
Comedy
Zach: I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mike: I'M GOING TO BEAT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Zach: BEAT?! WHAT???!!!!!!!!!! Mike: MY MEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Zach: Ahhhhhhh... 0:50
The "Tag. you're it" line is brilliant and should be appreciated.
I rather Eat It.
The mental image of 2 grown men sitting in a recording booth yelling “my penis” and stupidly laughing will never fail to make me crack up
oh god  THAT website
Bro before I watched this video I said those things
I stumbled across this, and I saw the computer and laughed harder at the knowledge of what's on the screen
1:50 is perfect.👌
I want someone to animate all the outtakes at the end of the video
Wordplay
Ayyyo that e621 a yiff site a orn place on that computer, lol interesting GG
Man you should make more mike and zach
Bro the take at 1:50 is just too funny 😭
I’m gonna beat mine tonight
i love watching Mike and Zach beat it
I can’t believe i know what that website is now that i’m watching this again.
Mike is a furry lmao?
Ohh god this just like whos on first all over again
Nothing could beat this video
This video is very good, it’s so good that nowt could beat it. Not even I could *BEAT IT*
1:06  When your friend says who asked to a question he literally asked himself:
MY *M E A T*
"I AM GONNA FUCKING MASTURBATE-"
Thumbnail is like auto generated looking but it looks so much funnier that way xD
Zach kinda looks like Jon Tron.
Risky click of the day
I like the fact that anyone who mentions e621 basically admits to using it if they associate it with furry stuff or just know the implications of it.
Tell me you animation you used
Mike is a furry
Bro is on furry porn!?!?!?!
Oh ok the web site xD noooooo!
My boyfriend sent me this 😭
They should hire this man for south park
Isn't anyone going to say anything about Mike opening e621?
"my meat" going too hard
This man makes better animations than modern cartoon companies, and it's great! Btw I think I'm gonna make my kids watch this one day and they're not gonna know what you're talking about 😂
honestly you shouldve kept "my cock" in i wouldve fucking exploded laughing if I heard that out of nowhere
e621 caught me off guard bro 💀
Not the Mike and Zach I thought it was
Nice
What’s up oh my gosh
I love the Spyro figurine on the shelf. Nice detail.
Can we get more suction cup man
Whys he beating his meat?
😂😂😂😂😂
23 instances of "beat it" in this video
What does he mean by Beat it?
I could hear Mike and Zach's neighbors talking about what is going on as they (The neighbors) cover their kid's ears
From the thumbnail alone I thought it was just about Mike going to “beat it”. Guess I was kind of right.
E6???
M Y M E A T.. M Y W E E N E R.. M Y 🐓 A N D B A L L S.. M Y F A T F U C K I N G 🐓 M Y P E E N I-
beat my meet  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂
The moment you turned the computer on my jaw DROPPED. /pos
Can anyone else hear the laughing while they were talking? Just me? Ok.
Mike's concern after Zach said "That's it, I'm gonna beat it" was very well captured lol
1:11 Poor Mike got hit in the face 😢
I really wonder what was the inspiration for this skit. It keeps me up at night.
went 1 to 999999 in a second
Micheal Jackson in a nutshell:
1:12 My girlfriend if she catches me.
I know this is late, but seeing the E6 logo honesty made me jump-
I think this "beats" the term 0 to 100 to a degree... it.
At 1:10 look it’s a secret for boomerang in a gun fight.
When I saw the title I KNEW that they would play the beat it song and, they did.
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
Is this mike burnfire?
Why was he using E621!
Animation tutorial?
Ah yes more proof that Piemations is a furry because mike searched up e621
Jack in it just slimpfies everything
Can u make more Mike and Zach Season2
Beat it.
I love to imagine that there is a random bystander that heard the takes though a wall and was just really confused and worried.
Hey look, my favorite website!
Zack is looking at furry porn
Mike's a furry confirmed
When the world needed them most they returened
half of the video is the endcards :/
1:50 best line in the video
like a south park fan made animation I end up in this I don't even know
MIKESSS A FURY LMAO 0:44
Half of the video is just outtakes of Mike yelling about his meat LOL
Heh, E621 Reference
OwO 0:45
Can we see Mike and Zach meet Suction Cup Man?
0:44 WYSI
Beat it
One go in you can never go back
beat doesnt sound like a real word after this video
the fucking e621 tab is making too much sense, especially considering his most recent video as of now
So is mike a furry because the thing hes gonna beat his meat to looks KINDA LIKA FURRY
I hope skim milk isn’t a victim of this video
BEAT IT!
This was so funny that I was literally drooling from my lips😂😂😂😂😂
The only disappointment here is that you said "meat" at the end instead of literally any of the alternatives :')
I swear these guys remind me of Smosh
Mike had the most forbidden of forbidden websites on his computer 💀
Ah yes. furry porn.
mike, i can help you beat it. YOU WANNA HELP ME BEAT IT!?! ZACK!!!
this is amazing.
0:53
:45 was NOT expecting that lmao
God this just beats all the other videos I've watched today
Ibwonder if mike and zack will ever come across suction cup man bcs i noticed in the beard episode mr. Guy bissness is on the bus
Seing E621 scares me
Micheal Jackson reference
Incase anyone didn't get the joke at the end: Zach said he was going to beat 'it'. He tagged Mike, making Mike 'it'.
I love that "Tag, you're it!" line! Really clever.
JUST BEAT IT, JUST BEAT IT, JUST BEAT IT, JUST BEAT IT, JUST BEAT IT, JUST BEAT IT, JUST BEAT IT
e621
this gives hellbender vibes
PLEASE tell me they have a gaming channel where they just say random shit like games grumps
This is why this is my favorite channel.
As soon as I saw E621 on the screen I laughed my fucking ass off
I love the Spyro figurine on the bookshelf in Mike's room. 💜
"Eat it!" "Eat what? "My meat"
So relatable
I love the outtakes 😂😂
B😂
He did not just pull up e6
0:45 oh my god, my friend showed me this website and i came back to this video and saw that, didnt knew that he is that type of person
Is it wrong that I was laughing the whole time
I wish there were more Mike and Zach videos ☹️
LMAO THE WAY HE OPENED E621 LOLL
1:50-1:59 lmao
why did you have to use *that* website...
Ma bran mush
You know its an issue when you recognize the website
Good video, now beat it!
E621, my man
0:45  The fact that I immediately recognised what the website was just from the colour in less than a second.
when i saw what was on the pc:
despite how short it is this has gotta be my favorite mike and zack episode to date holy shit  "MY MMMMMMMMMEAT"
I just love the sense of comedy these two have
naw he's on e621
It all started with skim milk and now it’s about beat it
"MY MEAT"
Oh my god I have tears in me eyes. I have laughed so hard before in soooo long.
I like how zach just doesnt get it and when zach finally does get it he just fuckin punches mike
Mike, is "Beat it" actually your favorite song?
Zach's cluelessness about all of this is hilarious and I couldn't help but laugh when I saw what website was pulled up
*AMAZING*
1:12 Took me a while to realize what the joke behind this was…needless to say, that’s some genius level Slapstick…
Keep
I’m not even halfway and I’m losing it. (edit) 1:10 I just noticed Todd and Sean on the back!
Eat It     - Weird Al Yankovic
This is really a gem of the internet.
ZACH?!?!?!?!? FROM EMKAY?!?!?!
Me: No piemations? Piemations: YEEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!
Im gonna learn how too audio clip just so i can have MY MEAT as a notification
Is that e621
Wait, that's not the hub.              I FUCKING KNEW IT!
this feels like a 2 min south park episode
omg the e6 caught me so off guard holy s*it
I don't know if anyone noticed but in the voice test section, you can hear someone laughing in the far distance and it makes it all the more funnier.
I like the hayseed plushies
I thought this was another mike and zach duo
Why does the thumbnail look sus as hell
Omg the e621 lmoa
Ah the pronoun game
me to
2:10 MY mMmmM-hahaha!
Me Weinas!!
me seeing E821 on the screen:DONT RUIN HIS INNOCENCE!
Bros Face After Mike says " MY MEAT" 💀 also why does mike look like he's moaning?
What is the feel like something I would do misunderstand something to this point. I don’t think I would be at the same time. I see myself doing this.
Is the funny
Unfun fact e621 is an actual website
this joke didn't go past my mind
The way you animated them shaking slightly while stuttering makes it so much better
I WILL BEAT MY MEAT WHILE WE ARE PLAYING IN A 2-PLAYER RACE IN MARIOKART!
“That’s it, I’m gonna beat it” “Uh wait, now what’re we beating?” “Tag! YOU’RE IT!!!”
neat
Weird al's eat it is better
My headphones died during the extra takes  so I just heard “MY FAT FUCKING CO-“
The website is E621 lol I'm not a furry tho
YOUR IT!!!
Oh no.. not THAT site...
And to fucking E6
1:36 This voice crack cures my depression.
That wasn’t a game 💀
can't relate i don't have any meat to beat
e621?????????????
NO! oh god no! i feel fuckin- called out rn
Just  b e a t  i t
This is a prime example of why the English language is just 3 languages in a trench coat.
0:45, he’s a furry lol (On the computer screen)
Am i the only one who noticed the website he was on was e621?
And the channel is FOR KIDS YouTube this is bullshit it clearly isn't let me DO NOTIFICATIONS AND BACKGROUND PLAY
"MY MEAT"  Dumbledore said calmly
Oh dear God- He's gonna beat it to-
"Ah yes piemations is not a furry"
I thought this was a Mikeburnfire/Zach Hazard thing.
Peak comedy
1:09    ❤😂
Spank the monkey huh , Take palm-ella out, Burp the worm, Consult prof. Hans Jerkov ?  🤣
What is this 😂😂😂😂😂
I died when i saw e621 😭😭
I love the plushies in the background
*beat it intensifies*
Okay but that fucking punchline killed me.  _...haha get it? punch line? anyway..._
i see that e621 >w>
E612 HAHA!
Yo what is bro doing on e621🤨
0:45 Aint no way
E621... Great reference
dude legit pulled up the artificial sweetener website
On a 1st December be like :
I was gonna point out "OMG FUNNY FURRY SITE" then I realized you're Piemations...
Is it just me or did anyone else notice e621 on the browser 🌚😂
The screaming in the end and them just both dying over how silly it is. Lmao
Am I the only one that noticed the e621 logo on the screen😂
the fact he pulled up e621 made this gold
It took me now to realize the song is from MJ,the pop king himself.
Mike's a furry? He searched a furry nsfw website...
I saw that E621 tab ;3
cum
The computer when he hits the keyboard 💀  "Is that a game?.."
Mike is a furry confirmed?
Zach's face when Mike said he was going to beat his🥩 is priceless
Someones halls just got decked
0:45 I see what you did there
Why was Mike on e6!!
I garente that my friends are going to quote this video for years
woahwoahwoah not msg
Zack should have been a homie and beat it for Mike 😂
This is a good representation as to how many things “beat it” can mean
m e a t
E621? Nice
Mmmmmmm e621 yeeeees
Naw piemations is going wild with these animations
WTH 😂😂😂
So freaking relatable when I try to use beat it like in a video game or cooking. But I rather just shout the whole word if I Get caught. I'd go wifh Im busy or I'm fucking around shooing their attention when they catch my red flushed face and changing acting like I did exercise.
bloopers killed me
that last part was so clever
Ohhh, I get it now
He wants to beat Mike Hawk?
HEHEHEHEHE, E FRICKIN 6, HOLY HELL!
💅👀💅     👄
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ngl this video looks like South Park 😅😭
took me nearly as long as Zach to be honest to understand was until he mentioned tissues that it hit me
I saw that e621 😌
The fact that Zach doesn’t know what Mike is talking about when he pulls out the lotion & tissues, yet understands what beating his meat means is crazy
The thumbnail and title out of context look very sus
Furry identified
once you hear something many times you start to realize how weird it sounds when you say it.
I did the math In the 1 minute and 15 seconds sketch, the phrase “Beat It” was said 23 times. Thats 1 “Beat it” every roughly 3.2 second
**sees the website he went to**   *Wait a second this place looks familiar*
“ MY MEAT! “
congratulations! “beat” now sounds like a made up word for the next 5 minutes :D
Am I the only one who notices they don't have a printer anymore?
He just wanted to beat it…
Nothing beats two men in a small room yelling at their mics.
This shit made me fucking burst
ayo is that a lexus isf at the start of the video?? piemations is a car guy??
This video made me *BUST* out laughing.
Please use some of these outtakes in the next Suction Cup Man.
1:50 it makes it funnier because you hear someone laugh in the background.
1:50  Has to be my favorite XD
God, Please have mercy on the neighbors next door
I have Noticed the Many meanings of Beat It to day.
That escalated quickly
1:32 and 1:41 best part
why
LMAO THE e6 SITE
Damn Mike has a hotkey for e621
ambatakam
Mike is a furry, he deadass opened E621
Wait Zach wants to help Mike beat it to furry porn on e621?
“MY COCK AND B A L L S.” What a MASTERPIECE
Hahahahah 1:13
Third base
What did he pull up on the computer!!!?
No context              My favorite
Lol
Oh fuck, this slaps me on the knee!
IM GONNA BEAT IT BEAT WHAT MY MEAT
My face when Mike slowly started pulling out lotion, tissues and my whip lash when E621 popped up lmao
This whole video gives me “I’m at soup” vibes
"MY P3NIS!" 💀
Well this was a good video and all, but I'm busy so I'ma go and beat it
im watching at 999k views
beat
Zach: “What are you going to beat?!” “ Mike: “MY MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEAT!!!!!!!!”
🤣🤣🤣
the E6 page broke me
One Two Three Four Beat your meat upon the floor Beat your meat. Beat your meat.
I just noticed this but you guys give me early smosh vibes
I can help you beat it 💀
When i saw Zach and Mike i thought Mikefireburn
IM GONNA BEAT IT BEAT WHAT  MY MEAT   Aughh
*MY MEAT*
this should have been ur stuntman 3 part
(0:44) AYO WAIT A MINUTE, *WHY THERE!?*
thats not how tag works
God the after cred stuff 😂 Piemations again making me wish i had enough money to fund them, shame YouTube is a Square and doesn’t like comedy
ah, e621. a man of culture.
That’s quite the use of a thumbnail with the title
Wtf he opened a totally sfw site!
I can’t beat how good this video is. Nothing can beat it.
Beat it, I'm gonna beat it Friend: I'll get out of your hair Me: My hair? Friend: HOW COULD YOU NOT THE MEANING?! Me: WHAT MEANING? Friend: I'm just gonna beat it Me: Ew I don't what to know that
Personally, the final WIENER was my favorite and in my opinion, should have been the one used in the animation.
1:50 the way Zach yelled
couldve sworn he was going to do a meat tenderizer joke at the end
Ono. Only a furry knows what horrors that website contains.
BEAT WHAT       MY MEAT
I saw that site
“MY MEAT”
Tag. You're it.
What is e621
Did anyone see the Easter egg?
There’s just something so unbelievably funny about hearing “MY FAT FUCKING COCK” from a far distance during 1:50
Lmao
I saw that website... I screamed for a second
This is the best video ever XD  Thank you Piemation 😊
I here some laughing when you some headphones
MY MEAT
The website of champions.
Oh my god just seeing fucking e6 pop up I can't that broke me
Strong Skim Milk Energy
OH NO HE'S ON E621
This is indicative of the conversations that take place at my house...
The end part. I’m going to beat it. Wait what’s it. Tag YOUR IT
0:45 never heard any game called e621... Is it fun?
your neighborhood is probably so confused
Bro this looks like if south park had more budget
love the e621 when he smashed the keyboard XD
I don’t think he knows how tag works
I love watching Mike & Zach beat it
0:55 LOL
imagine you walking along their house and hearing them recording this XD
i just realize the website is
If the South Park guys ever retire, I would replace them with Flashgitz and put you guys in charge of animation.
What a thumbnail
Beat it
He was gonna beat it to a protogen
WHY WAS HE USING E621
*MY MEAT!*   - Dumbledore said calmly.
looks like mike just a pure beat maker.
just give piemations an adult swim show
Anyone catch that website lol
Oh, that was a familiar site.
damn mike a furry tho
e621.....
Mike literally loaded up the most inappropriate thing allowed on youtube
the remix 💀
they what
0:50 business man voice in SUCTION CUP MAN
I beat comment
Wish this was based on real events.
Just him screaming "MY MEAT" is so funny
WAITWHAT
I will help u beat it
monosodium glutamate
💀
Cool
IM GONNA BEAT MY MEAT
The bottle reading ’Big Moisture Slippy Smooth’
this animation looks like something you would find on adult swim
1:54 mike cok
I hate how I recognised the website almost instantly
I thought they would have went further with "but you aren't in the kitchen"
I feel like pie just living with a 1300 mile vicinity of your neighborhood drives the prices down
Anyone i men ANYONE who heard that out of context must be so confused.
Lol I got a flying gorilla add while watching
My face when he booted up e621 ☠️
I just noticed now why he tagged him- Because he's "It" and he says he's gonna Beat "It"
I’m ashamed that I actually know the website the popped up when Zack slammed his keyboard 😔
Oh man, this video is so good. I could not imagine anything “beating” this.
oh god I didn't notice he opened e621 the first time I watched this I am dying
YouTube put this on YouTube kids
Just the e621 tab
the waffle house has found it's new host
I love that mike is a closeted furry
I just noticed what website he was going on and it unsettles me
Sir I believe he's going to Jerk chicken
"YOU WANNA HELP ME BEAT IT?!" my favourite bit of this vid.
I love how if you listen really closely during the outtakes, you can faintly hear Robin laughing in the background. And I just think that's hilarious. 🤣
Mike always gave "E621 regular" vibes
I just realized I have two favorite YouTuber duos and they’re both named mike and Zach. This two from Piemations and the two from MikeBurnFire.
After seeing this video ten times I only recently noticed he loaded up e621 on his computer
the sheriff todd and shawn plushies on the bookshelf!! 1:09
I love how the last take was “mai weenor”
I'm looking for a Cauck. Mike Cauck. Everyone do you see Mike Cauck!!
Why do Mikes and Zach’s work well together so well
this is beautiful  ive looked at this for five hours now
The "you're it" was both hilarious... And genius.
The E 621 was a funny touch he's a furry
“MY HOTDOG”  - Mike, probably.
They used every type of definition of "beat it" in one entire video! 😂
#0:55 when we have steak
Truly,Truly nothing can beat this song but since your in the comments you finished the video probably, so beat it
0:45 no not e621
Ahh E6... A furrys best friend and only bookmarked tab
"YOU WANNA HELP ME BEAT IT?!" gold
The e621 window popping up killed me
beat it
you two should do a cross over with mikeburnfire itd be hilarious
oh god the website lmaooooo
M Y M E A T
HE OPENED E621?? HELLO????
I accidentally skipped back just as Mike hit the keyboard and for some reason, I don't know why, I knew it was gonna be an e621 joke in specific.
0:45 𝕀 𝕣𝕖𝕔𝕠𝕘𝕟𝕚𝕫𝕖 𝕥𝕙𝕒𝕥 𝕤𝕚𝕥𝕖
Anybody gonna talk about what website he was gonna use?
Recording this must have taking forever. Pristine comedy
WAIT TF ON THE COMPUTER
Man I love this channel
monosodium glutamate on the computer 🤨
I found an Easter egg in the video, relating to boomerang in a gun fight
Eyo Mike what u watching on e621? >:)
They should do the same, but with the word "run"
im so glad this is still up.
THIS WAS SO FRICKING FUNNY FOR NO REASON
i cant tell if zach is a boy or a girl
Here at 884,708 views.
E621 popping up is amazing
I going do this to my sister
I’m gonna beat it *starts beating up the movie it*
Jajajajaja he is a furry XD
this i understand 0:40
I mean, they did beat it. 🤷‍♀️
Just beat it. Your meat it.
0:57  *A a a h h h h . . .*
At 0:45 that site on the screen is rule 34 but for furrys and how did they know that exist too?
When his computer pops up it shows something..
BEAT WHAT?!!!! MY MEEEEEE-
HOW COME YOU'RE ALWAYS SUCH A FUSSY YOUNG MAN?
ah yes I'm watching this in ddd but why did he open e621 instead of r34 is he a furry? I hate that I know what website that is I really should stop playing hlm2 costume campaigns.... na
1:18 not gonna lie these clips are so funny i popped my ears
Omg that's so ridiculous 😂😂😂
This is surprisingly not the only duo named Mike and Zach that I know
Nothing can beat piemations
that had to be the most fucked up vaudeville act I have ever seen
Beat it (masturbate) Beat it (go away/go) Beat it (hit something)  For those who don’t get it. 😀
This really shows how context matters when you say “beat it”
For anyone not I the know, e621 is this game where you search up various Pokémon on it, then download various images you find and airdrop them in crowded places where no one knows you.
I like how half the video is just 2 grown men laughing about different ways to say "my dick". This is truly peak entertainment.
I wonder if this video is monetised…
Wait is Zach the same Zach that used to voice for Emkay?
Damn me and Mike play the same game, I wonder what level he's on 🤔
E621 moment
0:44 😐
I’m loving the newer art styles! Especially how the character shapes are so much more different and definable than earlier.
LOL I LOVE THE PART WHEN HE SAID "MY MEAT!"
Lmfao i wonder what your neighbors had to think recording this
0:45  I don't see anyone talking about T H I S
Not sure why I sat here and listened to them scream all the different words to describe the male genital, yet here I am at the end of the video.
Zach is stupid
Bro I had this at full volume and my mom was like “what?? 😂”
MIKE AND ZACH ARE BACK BABY!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dumbledore said calmly
I wish I could beat IT.
a+ screams, guys
i havent aged a day since i turned twelve, havent i
0:52 😂
Please remake the amazing soldier
Make more suction cup man movies
Was that... e621? Lmao
duh duh duh duh duh, duh duh duh duh, something something something sooomething.
Imagine hearing this and not knowing what it is for
I was hoping Mike was going to say "MY COCK" so I'm glad we got those extra takes at the end
You should make another suction cup man video
Excellent Use of Beat It
Bro the thumbnail
Masterpiece😌👌
Lol e621
0:33 " i- wait what are we beating? " This got me
MY MEAT 0:55
They should totally make an extended music video for them singing beat it
When will there be suction cup man 5 come out
e-e621… man’s getting freaky
1:04 There is a Tod and Shaun plush on the shelf
Hey...I think their gonna beat it
I know you said you're done but you only had two games left, (unless you count the Steel Wool saga,) 5AM at Freddy's Sister Location and Pizza Simulator?
They fact he went on e6 tells you something
1:40
This joke literally has so many layers to it. Such craftsmanship.
jajajaja
THE FUCKING E621 ON THE COMPUTER
TIL youtube has good comedy timing because i got an ad for milk before this video
When Is suction cup man 5
“YOU WANT TO HELP ME BEAT IT?!?!?!” I’m dying 💀💀💀
Hey I know you done with the 5am at Freddy series but can you make a sb pls🥺
i hate furrys
I really beat it when I watch this it's amazing!
You're really making it difficult not to ship this.
Fecking this was one of my day and I love this cause its so Fecking funny
Lmao he was gonna "beat it" to furry porn.
I beat it but it came out
1:32 I spit my soda out in a hanger
I like the attention to detail with the the two plushes of Shawn and Todd in the background.
Will there ever be more suction cup man
Lol
This is so where'd. 1:18 Allright 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 1:33 What is happening ? 1:41 ,Allright really man do you have yo say that infrunt of poeple. 1:47 O.K. you went to far In leaving.
So, you like the E now do you
The second I saw that color scheme open up on his screen, I recognized it and fell back laughing
Hold on. Hold the fuck up. What website. Hold one second
Will suction cup man come back
E621 0:45
I love the English language
PIEMATION YEEEEEEEAH
When are you doing a suction cup man 5
Are you gonna make another team fortress video pls
Amazing
I wonder what fnaf security breach would be like if he kept making fnaf animation videos
Dead! ❤️
E621 nice
That thumbnail title combo is truly something
😂 😂 😂
I ate a chicken dinner while watching this
This beats all other Mike & Zach episode
bro when the e621 showed up i fricking died
When I saw "the setup":🤨📸 After he said "MY MEAT":💀🗿🤣
Do more 5AM at Freddy’s
mike is a furry o no
1:50 HIS FAT FUCKING 🐔

So glad to see you’ve recovered from the cring brony stuff and the utter degenerate furry stuff
Piemations make more 5am at freddy’s c’mon!!
e621
I miss 5am at freddy’s
You should make another such cup man video and I really hope your channel out
Really, you knew what you were doing with the Thumbnail and Title
Ohhhhhhhhhhh
If you listen closely during the takes, you can hear robin laughing his ass off
no nut November time
I just noticed the Spyro figurine behind Zach. Piemations just solidified their position as my favorite channel.
PLEASE MAKE TV SHOW LIKE HELL BOSS THIS SHIT IS FUNNY
Tag your it
The fact I haven’t seen people use Mike yelling “My meat/penis/wiener/cock!” as a sound bite for anything is shocking.
I’m trying so hard not to laugh in class when Mike said “YOU WANT TO HELP ME BEAT IT???”
wth the are the tissues for?
Repeat your knee there I said it for you
0:45 i thought it was edited... Well how wrong i was, Mike is a furry
Oh, your poor neighbors.
The website 🤨
…well at least me and Mike use the same website to beat it.
I just now got the last beat it joke
The fucking second e621 popped up I wheezed.
Mike Ox Long
can you pls do Team Fortress 2 animation
Hearing you both yell in the rest of the takes sparks joy LMAO
Can we have more sucshen cup man
can you make suction vub man 5 pls hes back! he lives
I will say, as soon as I saw the e621 homepage, I thought "Oh... you mean *beat* it...ah..."
can you make sucksuin cub man 5? pls i love it
He’s gonna spank his monkey heheh
fucking  amazing as always  lmfaooooooooooooo
E621 hmmm owo
Noice i just watched this after.
Them just screaming variations of d*ck at the end was the best part honestly lmao.
Can you do another suction cup man video
"I'm gonna do it" "Do what?" "Tag, you're it"
1:13
I'm gonna need to hear the full outtake reel plz
Michael has had enough and truly beats it.  *he could be doing this at any time, the day, night or even afternoon*  *he must be stopped* ALSO THIS MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE WOW.
Remember minecraft 15 sec xd
yeeeaaah. It's a game.
your video sucks!!
Sony gonna sue.
i love how he's selfawere with e621 LMAO
Just came back to this channel after a long hiatus. don't know why I ever left.
I dont think ive laughed any harder at a video in my entire life. this shit got me rolling on the floor.
I swear you've never drawn these characters the same way twice
beat it sounds quite suspicious thought doe.
Gee I wonder how many people saw this coming
I seriously thought Zach amd Mike from Mikeburnfire
Lololol
Notices thumnbnail: yeah am gonan pretend I've never saw that
* sees the website* oh no
MY MEAT
MIKE NO NOT E621
FUCK THIS SHIT IM OUT
You funny shmucks never fail to make me smile
Long story short "beat it"
this is the best video
I thought this was Mike burnfire for a second
It has no relation at all, but i can't get my brain to not associate Piemations Mike and Zach with Mike Burnfire and Zach Hazard.  This conversation wouldn't feel even slightly out of place with those two.
Ok time to beat it. *beats steak*. Ok its now flat. Time to eat it
e621 opening up REALLY caught me off guard XDDDDD
I wouldn’t have been able to yell my meat with a straight face either
Imagine just screaming “my meat” as an old couple walks by you
Okay, it might just be me but y'all have got to do some kind of crossover where your Mike and Zach meets Mikeburnfire Mike and Zach. For no reason other than jokes about names.
These parts get me 1:17
What's the game shown around 0:43
Don’t think I didn’t notice that website 👀
Omg lol!

Hi remember when you made that animation of the guy that could manifest hard light well someone is using it as a game add I’m guessing without permission it’s call stick man fight craft adventure
Almost 4 million people to put up with your bullshit, no one can beat the best
Imagine meet the amazing monoculus
Oh man that's a great game I'm on it a ton!
i hate and love this video
We're harnessing our inner manchild
Ladies and gentlemen, i present you the english language
0:50 mikes eyes...
Anybody named Zach or mike always be funny
I didn’t notice that Zach thought E621 was a game😂😂
The voice crack at the end got me
"No, Zack, beat it!"  My dirty @$$ mind: ☠️ The Man downstairs: "Time to go home 😈"
Not the e621.
Those takes were the funniest thing I've heard all day
Mike's Mystery Meat
Beat WHAT?  YOUR MOM

Lets appreciate that punch animation, on smart phone it felt real
0:35 "I'm gonna BEAT IT! *slams lotion on desk* " As soon as I saw the lotion I cackled
The "aaaah" after realizing what he was talking about-
Say remember that MLP series you planned on doing many years ago?      Why not…do it so that you have an series to do :3
Can you do suction cupman season 2
i like how it ends with  mike yelling MY WENIER and the bit were mike yells my meat made me laugh so hard

It's a miracle this hasn't been demonetized.

@Piemations 0:47 Oh NO.... What have YOU done (Rule 34 fanartists just got gained some fresh ideas from this official animation video. Good luck being sagged like a fag)...

How am I supposed to “beat it” Mike

Neat.
he sound like Gilbert Godfrey when he yells
Back in the good old days of YouTube you could have used the actual song
you'ge going to brazil
🤣
XD E621
furry spotted
😂
The title of the video made me think of Beat it by MJ and I'm happy that it started with it
The fucking e6 page killed me
The average discord conversation
I now want the piemations cover of Beat It
ah yes only the best
Хоть я очень плохо разбираюсь в английском, думаю если вы хоть немного знайте иностранные слэнги то вы поймёте юмор

This needs to be a tv shows.
Woah there
Good ol e621. Nice choice

It doesn’t matter whose wrong or right just BEAT IT
This is so fucking hilarious.
Im pretty sure I predicted this entire animation.

"Beat it sounds pretty sus"
Making me wanna beat it… 😳 My 🐓.

You wanna help me beat it?! Zach!!!! BEAT WHAT?!?! MY MEAT!!!!! aaaaaah…
furry
amazing
Mike stooped so low he turned to shinji
I guess I just learned something about mike
this is funny just beacuse of the fact that my brother visited and he was so confused as to why I had beat it on a record, its just a good song man :)
It
I love Dark Souls. I know it gets really hard, but its fun to beat it. Although I get way too excited and make others uncomfortable. I guess not too many people are into the same things as me. Too bad, its really fun with a friend. Trust me, its not easy at first, but if you keep going until the end, it will have a quite pleasing climax. Waitaminute...
IM GOING TO BEAT MY MEAT😡👿👿👿
The escalation! It escalated so fast!
I pulled some sorta ligament in my shoulder, and now it hurts whenever I laugh. I don’t regret clicking this.
This video is, in my opinion, the only good thing to come out of Michael Jackson's popularity. Otherwise, not a fan of his. But this is a masterpiece! 👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nice Video,unfortunately كانت الأرض خربة وخالية ، والظلام على وجه الغمر ، وروح الله يحوم فوق المياه. 3 وقال الله ليكن نور فكان نور. 4 ورأى الله النور حسنًا ، وفصل بين النور والظلمة. 5 ودعا الله النور نهارا والظلمة دعاها ليلا. وكان مساء وكان صباح اليوم الاول. 6 وقال الله ليكن قبو بين الماء ليفصل بين الماء والماء. 7 فعمل الله القبو وفصل بين الماء تحت القبو والماء الذي فوقه. وكان الأمر كذلك. 8 ودعا الله القبو سماء. وكان مساء وكان صباح يوما ثانيا. 9 وقال الله: ليجمع الماء من تحت السماء في مكان واحد ، ولتظهر اليابسة. وكان الأمر كذلك. 10 دعا الله اليابسة أرضًا ، والمياه المتجمعة سماها بحارًا. ورأى الله ذلك أنه حسن. 11 ثم قال الله: لتنبت الأرض نباتا ، وبقلا يبزر بذرا ، وأشجارا في الأرض تثمر وبقعا فيها على أنواعها. وكان الأمر كذلك. 12 ونبتت الأرض نباتا: نباتا يبزر بذرا حسب أنواعه ، وأشجارا مثمرة وبذرا كجنسها. ورأى الله ذلك أنه حسن. 13 وكان مساء وكان صباح يوما ثالثا. 14 وقال الله: "لتكن أنوار في قبة السماء تفصل بين النهار والليل ، ولتكون علامات للأوقات المقدسة والأيام والسنوات ، 15 ولتكون أنوارًا في قبو السماء. لتضيء على الأرض ". وكان الأمر كذلك. 16 فعمل الله نورين عظيمين: النور الاكبر ليحكم النهار والنور الاصغر ليحكم الليل. هو أيضا صنع النجوم. 17 وجعلها الله في قبة السماء لتنير على الأرض ، 18 لتحكم النهار والليل ، وتفصل بين النور والظلمة. ورأى الله ذلك أنه حسن. 19 وكان مساء وكان صباح يوما رابعا. ٢٠ وقال الله: ليكن الماء يعج ذواتًا حية ، وليكن طيرًا يطير فوق الأرض عبر قبة السماء.  fi albad' khalq allah alsamawat wal'arda. 2 kanat al'ard kharbatan wakhaliatan , walzalam ealaa wajh alghamar , waruh allah yahum fawq almayahi. 3 waqal allah liakun nur fakan nuru. 4 wara'aa allah alnuwr hsnan , wafasl bayn alnuwr walzulmati. 5 wadaea allah alnuwr naharan walzulmat daeaha lila. wakan masa'an wakan sabah alyawm alawili. 6 waqal allah liakun qabw bayn alma' liafsil bayn alma' walma'i. 7 faeamil allah alqabw wafasl bayn alma' taht alqabw walma' aladhi fawqahu. wakan al'amr kadhalika. 8 wadaea allah alqabw sama'a. wakan masa'an wakan sabah yawman thanian. 9 waqal allah: liajmae alma' min taht alsama' fi makan wahid , walitazhar alyabisatu. wakan al'amr kadhalika. 10 daea allah alyabisat ardan , walmiah almutajamieat samaaha bharan. wara'aa allah dhalik 'anah hasanu. 11 thuma qal allahu: litunbit al'ard nabatan , wabaqilan yabzir badharan , wa'ashjaran fi al'ard tuthmir wabaqaean fiha ealaa 'anwaeiha. wakan al'amr kadhalika. 12 wanabatat al'ard nabata: nabatan yabzir bidharan hasab 'anwaeih , wa'ashjaran muthmiratan wabidharan kajinsha. wara'aa allah dhalik 'anah hasanu. 13 wakan masa'an wakan sabah yawman thalitha. 14 waqal allah: "ltakun 'anwar fi qubat alsama' tafsil bayn alnahar wallayl , walitakun ealamat lil'awqat almuqadasat wal'ayaam walsanawat , 15 walitakun anwaran fi qabw alsama'i. litudi' ealaa al'ard ". wakan al'amr kadhalika. 16 faeamil allah nurin eazimayni: alnuwr alakbir liahkum alnahar walnuwr aliasaghar liahkum allayli. hu 'aydan sune alnujumu. 17 wajaealaha allah fi qubat alsama' litunir ealaa al'ard , 18 litahakum alnahar wallayl , watafsil bayn alnuwr walzulmati. wara'aa allah dhalik 'anah hasanu. 19 wakan masa'an wakan sabah yawman rabiea. 20 waqal allah: liakun alma' yaeiju dhwatan hayatan , waliakun tyran yatir fawq al'ard eabr qubat alsama'i.  🙂
Furry detector is beeping fast
i forgot how hilarious piemations stuff is. havent watched this channel in a really long time.
Cringe
It's so dumb but so genius
Was not expecting e621.  So I guess Mike is a furry then.
i hate my headphones its broken forever
wait i know that website...
From those fun and enjoyable to watch  Meet the amazing with tf2 6 years ago...   to these bullshits.. where did you go wrong
Hahaha ha 😆
for som reason, I automatically assumed it was Mike and Zack from MIKEBIRNFIRE
They stole sparkyin an ad
This. is. beautiful.
Have some more chicken, have some more pie, it doesn't matter if its boiled or fried, just eat it.
Hey piemations I was wondering what happened to the 5 am at Freddy's series and if your gonna continue it
Nothing could ever beat this video
The ending was the greatest ever nothing will beat it
please make suction cup man 5
I just noticed that Mike is a fan of Skylanders. In the background, theres what seems to be a Spyro Skylanders figure thing. Thats cool.
Michael is so proud of his bois. Just look at them, they completely understood the meaning of his song.
you should do five night at Freddy's security breach
0:45 Wait are you a furry?
I saw it first on Newgrounds first.
reading the title alone I thought of two outcomes and I am happy with which it turned out being
Why is he looking at e621
e621 beat_it animated order:score
I got the best ad for lotion before this
Ya
Bro that site is e621
You will make more  FNAF  animations  ?
T: It's all soup! P: What store are you in?! T: I'm at the soup store! P: Why are you shopping for clothes at the soup store?!
1:09 (Zack) That's it I'm gonna bet it! (Mike) oh-wait. Now what are you beating? (Zack) tag YOUR IT! (Pruchs Mike in the face) oww.
*_MMMMY MMMMMMEAT_*
Something tells me this actually happened
I realized the thumbnail is just Mike *MoAnInG*
Wow !! Good Animation ❤❤
Hey what’s that app
Really?
The E621 detail is hilarious
dude I just wanna eat my snack pack vanilla pudding in peace and the outtakes are just killing me XD
I-😭
piemations bring memories 6years ago😭
The ending is just to funny!!🤣🤣
*This video is absolutely incredible. Nothing could beat it.*
This video is absolutely incredible. Nothing could beat it.
Im from finland just know please come here
That e621 cameo! Lol
Man i miss the old u more tf2 meet the medic and people
YoUR IT!!!!!
Ooooooh boy I can only imagine what you’re neighbors are thinking of you 😂 I’m diying
Woooo welcome back piemations
I saw the joke before the video started and I still laughed twice as hard, this guy is a genius
Can’t believe it took me until now to the ‘Tag, you’re it!’ Joke
"MY MEAT" Dumbledoor said calmly
BRO E621 HAD ME CACKLING
When e621 popped up i fucking died
0:40 We knew Exactly where this was going to go to.
That's it I'm gonna beat it
This was very misleading
can u continue tf2 animations
Esix on the screen is simply amazing.
I can already hear a remix of the other takes
my favorite one 1:47
E6 0:43 wack
- What is your name? - Not, that isn't my name. - What? - What.
and yet we still don’t know what do you mean.
The e621 is a perfect addition
That's the quickest I have ever seen 2 men lost their shit
e621 is one of my favorite website’s 😅
1:12☠️☠️
0:13 he is becoming micheal jackson
Wow!!! 🤣
I cannot sympathize with a protagonist who visits e621. It’s simply too far.
My MEATT!!!!
I recognize that site
Holup Mike is on the cursed website
the audacity of this man going to e621 just for a gag, it's incredible
is that really a game?
Gold
Mike needs to animate himself picking his nose
Beat it
"beat it" count: 19
Just bean it dude
The website he was on to beat it tho o_o
Can't wait for suction cup man 5
THE ENDING I LOVE IT FUCK💀💀
Incredible thumbnail
They said the phrase "beat it" (Including the music video and NOT including them just saying it in the out-takes or saying Beat without It at the end) a total of 23 times.
I have nothing to say to this except 🤣
"MY MEAT!!!!" - Mike
I had no idea where this was going and I still don't even though I've finished the video
what are their neighbours thinking?
When will you do tf2 animations?
You could see tom hayseed in the backround i love that
Hilarious! 😂
My favorite part was when he said, "beat it."
By the gods not the furry site 🙏
I thought this was a different Mike and Zach lol
I saw this on newgrounds
when e621
Ah, i see he uses the best site ever for his beating it purposes
1:13
Funniest video for the next five years
"a game"
I recognize that website I've been there before
0:44 e621 bruh
0:45   Man you really thought you could get away with what’s on that computer screen huh?
I love it when they say "beat it"
oh no hes on E621
Somehow no "my dick" in the outtakes.
Imma be honest before I clicked on the video I thought it was them using their art and animation style to visualize one of Zach and mikes adventures from the mikeburnfire channel lol wtf
Can you be like Pacific over what meat
Ah yes, one of the best sites for that XD good ol E6
bring suction cup man back
I'm pretty sure everytime they say "beat it" it meant something different
Average conversation at EzPz headquarters
like the mini spyro statue
“You want to help me beat it? ZACK!!”   I died Omg 🤣
peniful as usual
I love me some who's on first humor.
now mike is canonically a furry          nice
Dude what in the actual fuck am i about to watch
This beats me watching someone beat it while asking me to beat it while listening to beat it.
The word beat is used 34 times in the whole video
where tf2 animation?
This guy has the weirdest relationship with furries and I don't know why it's not joked about more
No other video could beat it like this one
I know what website that was, LMFAO.
THIS IS AWESOME AND HILARIOUS
the return of the dead.
You seriously need to animate your own show. TV show, youtube show, idk. SOMETHING. You're too genius with your writing and animation to the point where it's scary.
The sad thing is that mike never beat it
Yeah Zack Beat It
I thought this was gonna be a mikeburnfire animation lmao
I need moreeee
Oh God it's the furry site
Ay yo, that web page homie
e621? based
That website is for furrys isnt it
michael jackson is gonna be tramatizied
4:45 killed me bro I couldn’t contain my oxygen
Ay yo? 🤨📸
damn he didnt even get to beat it :c
Piemations has such an iconic art style he could animate the new Eddsworld series or something and we would never know
I was dead at the extra takes. You know your humor is gone when a guy yelling multiple words for penis makes you cry laughing
They know how to beat a dead horse
I like the part where he says "beat it"
When I saw "Mike and Zach" I thought this was a Mikeburnfire and ZachHazard cameo XD
Hmm... Now I want soup.
These never get old.
Dunno eat it is better.
I like how the outro is half the video
Short but sweet
1:08 neat plushies! almost as good as suction cup man
Not e621 😭✋
if you know the website you're cool ;)
I love how they progressively get younger each video.
Screaming my meat into the mic would have me in hysterics too
"MY MEAT!"
First time watching so fucking funny I had to sub
Tag your it Proceeds to knock them out
5
Do suction cup man
The blue site is lowkey better than the green one no discussion
holy macaroni!! is that really Zack from MikeBurnFire?
I love how straight forward mike is but when zach says he's gonna 'beat it' Mike is like "Yo, thats sus"
It’s official Mike is a furry 🤣
e621 huh?
I kinda wanna beat it
E621!!!!??!
That was amazing
*looks at thumbnail. Looks at title* Please be about eggs or Michael Jackson-
Mike is beating it and Zack is beating his ass
Lmfao I want someone to do a harvester style edit with Mike just shouting MY MEAT!!
Hmm I wonder what that website that popped up was, I guess I must search it up to find out  *7 hours later* Yeah I think I see what the site is for now. See you same time tomorrow
Is that the furry site, E621?
Mikeburnfire fans are very confused rn
I know you're probably sick of hearing this from other people at least I believe so but can we please have more suction cup man
Also, missed opportunity for a hidden sponsor on the computer
There just getting older and older 😭
The names Mike and Zach made me think it was a MikeBurnFire reference
Absolute gold
These guys' voices are so iconic
Oh, I thought this was a Mikeburnfire video when I saw the title.
*Not sponsored by e621
0:45 Hol up  (Make sure it's paused)
Thanks!
You guys are about as sharp as a bowling ball.
goddman.. the e621 search page..
That e621 reference lol
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Yeow
this could've gone very differantly
"One of the people who like this you will be a billionaire one day"  "Good luck,"..😂😂😂.
0:45 e621.. another man cursed with knowledge.
what about "My 3 centimeter defeater"
Was he gonna punch a steak that he keeps under his dest,? or...
I always wonder In the future are we going to see more of suction cup man man all 4 episodes were awesome you guys did a good job on it 😊
damn
I thought it was something else…
Yoooo it’s the emkay dude
Parents trying to understand kids be like
the face when he says "aaaaaaaaahhhh...."
i'm so confused.
Nooo me being the furry I am the second I saw e621 I went OHHHHH SHHHHIIIITTTT
i watched this video while beating it
i would love to voice act and game with these guys LOL!!! i can just imagine us over the mic!!
The way the screen pulled up e621
deaf people: :D   blind people: 🥵
I can imagine neighbors hearing Mike yell "MY MEAT!!"  Over and over again.
I love watching them beat it
The second I saw the tissues and "big moisture" I wish I had regained my innocence back
He going to beat it 😂🤣
You knew what you were doing
lol
zach h fuller of emkay fame. great.
half expected it to just end up just not being about masturbation
Ah, E6, a fellow man of culture
I just noticed that Zach tags Mike twice when he says "Tag! YOU'RE IT!" Once with the tap, second with the punch...
I saw the spyro figurine in the background lmfao. Well pit together. 👏👏👏
Fucking E6. Lol
That's crazy Pie Michael Mations
bro really pulled up E621
Why e6?
The end takes have me sobbing 😭😭
nothing beats this video.
I was wondering why Piemations made a video about Mike Burnfire and his friend Zach Hazard.
bro at 0:45 why was e621 on there?
Ok that was good
Makes me think of when the movie "IT" came out and everyone in my friends school was all like Dave: Have u seen IT? XD John: Seen what? :/ Dave: IT XD John: What is IT? :/ Dave: IT is a movie. XD John: I know it is a movie, but what is the movie called? Dave: IT XD
So did he beat it with Mike? We never got a solid conclusion to this scenario
Dawgs computer auto opened to fuckin e6. Madman
Just those two lines, man: BEAT WHAT? MY MEAT!
Wait is Mike a furry? Also is that Mikeburnfire and Zach Hazard?
IM BEAT MY BEANS >;)
we uh.... all gonna gloss past that e621 reference?
Dying rn this is amazing
Thing is, I understood the entire conversation lol
Am i the only one waiting for another suction cup man
As a Zach myself I can understand why he was confused we zachs aren't the brightest of creatures
I can imagine that this dialog is actually happened IRL xD
Dude really had E621 open & ready huh
mans uses e6
Don't think I didn't see those Sheriff Hayseed plushes
Mailman is about to knock on the door to deliver a package and hears nothing but the loud parts from 1:19 forward.   🚘🏃💨                📦
bro its september
Puns the animation.
I see that e621 👀
My favorite part was when he said 'beat it'
I just beat it
Ok but why did e621 open?
Behold they have reached peak comedy.
Oh, oh no
can I point out the little animation detail at 0:25 ? The way mike shakes his head slightly while closing his eyes for a second to REALLY capture the really tiny but noticeable pause of the voice acting.  Hilarious as always, and animation game is still strong to everyone who assisted making it!
The thumbnail combined with the title is so perfect  And then the context of the video comes in and it just sent me 🤣🤣
YOU SHOULDVE STUCK WITH “MY WEINER” THAT WOULD’VE BEEN SO MUCH FUNNIER DUDE
Ah, Monosodium glutamate, my favorite website
Oddly normal talk with your love ones
Thank you YouTube for notifying me 4 days later after this video released.
Oh my god the furry site
0:42 MY EYES! THEY BURN! NOT THE E!
LMAO
Holy sh-- I lost it when his computer immediately went to e621
When Mike said MY MEAT I felt that.
0:45 e621 huh?
Mike looks like that old cowboy screaming meme.
Autism in a nutshell
IM WHEEZING
I saw the colors and I knew in an instant   So, ya like Rito or Spyro
“You wanna help me BEAT IT?!  ZACK!”
Todd and Shawn cameo ic
THE E6 POPPING UP ON THE MONITOR???
I instantly thought of micheal jackson
This is so dumb
HIS MEAT.
*"M Y   M E A T !"*  "aaaaahhhhhhhhhhh."
0:44 Mike is a furry confirmed.
For a second I thought this was related to mikeburnfire.
Well that was an experience
That website is a little different
as a furry I'm giggling heavily
HALO!?
What the hell
e621 is the best
wait who's on first? why are they buying clothes at the soup store?
and this is why you should     have some more chicken have some more pie it doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried
Sus detected 😳 0:52
Nothing can beat the comedy level of this skit. Nothing can beat It, Wait
Yep. Totally glad I watched this while not wearing headphones.
The fact that he auto-opened e621...says alot about why he wants to beat it
i almost jumped out of my chair when i saw the e621 search bar
I never thought about the different uses of beat it before 🤣
they do make great husbands to each other
Holy sht 😂😂
i love you man
Omg the e621
Meat it
Wow, Zach has really come far from using a shotgun at point blank range towards Mike...       What do you mean these two aren't the same Mike and Zach that go out bounty hunting, with brief escapades with misses cactus
it took me 2 times watching this to notice e621 on the computer
so Mike likes to beat it to e621 stuff huh?
nIce
Thought this was a MikeBurnFire and Zach Hazard fan animation.
oh god this sounds like my discord messages
I wasn't fooled by the title or thumbnail. I immediately thought of the song... and then it turned into something else.
MY WEINERRRR
Not gonna lie, at first I thought this was a reference to Mike & Zach from mikeburnfire, but regardless, this is a pretty funny short
"beat it" was said 23 times in just over a minute
Zach’s face when Mike screams *”MY  M E A T !”* had me *BURST* with laughter
I got an old spice lotion ad before they played the actual video
E621 really
whats e621?  edit nvm
Common Pie W
...im not gonna say what was on his screen XD
Thank you for blessing us with those extra takes
Featured on r/perfectlycutscreams.
You can literally take this out of context real easily 😂
Lol I probably be piss off too. When saying beat it and getting so confuse.
I am unconvinced this is the exact number of takes you had to take, just to deliver that line with a straight face. I want the exact count.  ...And then a video which comprises entirely of just a full hour of mike screaming about his penis, because god damn it, I am too easily amused, please help me.
The e621 joke absolutely topped it off I must say
Zach is
1:37 nourishment for the soul
💀😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
C-context?! Oh nevermind.
In all honesty this shouldve been a suction cup man and business dummy thing
...e621..huh. wouldn't think you to be into that sorta thing, but each to there own lol. Seeing that on the PC made me break lmao, even more then the "BEAT IT" joke. This vid is a comedic masterpiece.
The English language is beautiful at times
Arby's My meat!
Nice to see that MikeBurnFire is a patreon
I originally thought they were gonna make a michal Jackson refrence, they did but there was M O R E
Expected Weird Al, got Mike immediately wanting to beat it after jamming to beat it
Question is... what can't be beaten?
Man I really want to beat it after watching this video                   No not that kind of beat it
Holy shit he posted
I am actually curious was this just a joke between the two of you or did this actually happen I can't tell 🤣
Okay that’s a good play on words.
the fuckin e621 joke fried my brain
woah thats a pretty cool looking game, I'm gonna go look it up to see if I can play it
wait wait robin from emkay
yeah im going to beat it, cya
Yes

Did anyone notice the two plushies on the shelf?
AAAAAAAAAGGGGHHHHHHHHH
The fact all for their saying was correct must really be hell for anyone trying to learn English lol
That. Was so fucking funny oh my God. I dunno why this made me laugh so much, but it did.   Also nice Monosodium Glutamate site
E621...
Ye know I dont what happened in this video
I am here... Because of a completely different channel because apparently YouTube can't tell there are more then 2 channels with a pair of people called 'Zach and Mike'sXD
This video is fire af
That makes Emkay apart of the piemations universe, please do more Narrators
Is that e621 I see?
Nice
*WHEEZE* XD
I saw Mike and Zach and thought this was an animation about another Duo named Mike and Zach.
“I’m gonna beat it” “Wait what are we beating?” “Tag, ur ‘it.’”  That gassed me. Why in any fabricated fuck did I laugh at that
I knew exactly where this was going and as soon as that tub of lube hit the desk I lost it in laughter. And those out takes, I had calmed down a little but when I heard Mike say MY COCK! I lost it again
Comedy gold love it lol
Why does this feel like an actual conversation mikeburnfire and Zach have actually had?
I was watching this in silence and almost screamed.
This is horrible
Bro that's like me and my brother having an argument
1:30 of the actual skit The last minute being guys yelling pen*s All things as it should be
The ending was phenomenal
LMFAO these always makes me laugh 😂😂😂😂
Had to pause and take a breath after seeing e621
That "game," was e621...
I know the logo of e621 way too well and that concerns me
It's official...Mike is a furry XD
kid named it:
kid named beat:
The outtakes really show me what my humor is like.
Very nice of you to put monosodium glutamate on the monitor.
I appreciate that half this video is just alternate takes.  They're almost funnier than the main bit.
half of the videos for the credits...nice?
That's a questionable game he had there
This has strong mike burnfire and zach hazard vibes
when he hit the computer... and the screen popped up... those who know... know..... XD hahaaahahah
I’d watch a series about the both of them
Zach yelling is so unusual that it sounds weird.
"Tag, you're IT"☠️.
Guys he was clearly beating some meat that he was going to season and cook later for dinner
Mikeburnfire is a Patreon supporter, they are connected
Should i be disappointed that i immediately recognized e6 just from the colors
Lmao he pulled up e6
E621 😂
Mike screaming "MY CAWK" actually made me snort
truly inspiring
Been watching a lot of Mike & Zach stuff recently Either this or Mike Burnfire and both feel interchangeable
*OMFG, THIS IS HYSTERICAL* 🤣🤣🤣
0:44 , uh oh...
This entire video highlights the ambiguity of the word ‘it’ in the english lexicon. Also the sheer VERSATILITY of ‘beat’.
haha michael furry
Umm... why e621?
Ayo, that website.  I see you.
Are we positive Zach and Mike aren't brothers? I have the 'a few more words makes the world go round' conversation with my brother/roomie all the time.
1:50
when I saw Mike and Zach I thought Piemations made an animation to mikeburnfire. Still this is good.
Excuse me wait was that E621? The… furry ya know what website?  Is there something Mike wants to tell us? XD
Laugh my ass watching this with a buddy didn't even see e6 the first time
You know, at first I read the title and thought. Oh this is a mikeburnfire episode turned into an animation, or Zach and Mike was offered to use their voices for it.  At first, I was sad.  Then I found it funny cause its the same crap they'd do too. So I am happy again.
Micheal Jackson would be proud of you XD
i love zach so fucking much
Nobody: ... Absolutely no one: ... Guys in bedroom: 1:36
It's beautiful
every time they say "beat it"  I say... "off"      don't attack me, pls!
0:44 glad I know that site
PIEMATION! YEEAAAAAAAAY!
Good way to start the day.
i thought this was a mikeburnfire reference for a minute,,
Best fing video yet nothing can beat it.
I love the casual Spyro Skylander figure in the back.
i know exactly what he was beating as he was pulling out tissues
whoa the way they beat it was immaculate
This is very funny with sponsor skip because the video just ends after the punch.
0:48   Ha-   Gaaaaaaaey
Video of the day
I knew the punchline but is still threw me for a loop, that's how a good joke is done
I usually only hear Zach's voice over at EzPz, so seeing him here was a nice surprise.
“What is that? A-a game?” No, Zach. It’s e6- well, actually, you’re better off not knowing.
Man, I-I don't know which moment to highlight here, I was literally losing my mind every second of this video!
*Unbeatable Quality*
E621 HAAA
Omg, this might be your best video so far with these characters 🤣😂
Thought this was gonna be something from MikeBurnFire cause he usually plays with his buddy zach but its just a crazy coincidence lol.Still a conversation i could see them having.
🤨
Tag...YOUR IT
To be honest I thought there's gonna be a 3rd person going to interrupt their conversation saying "Ay, I dunno what your beating in there, but can you please stfp"
Yayyyy piemations uploaded
This is just beautiful
I like the fact he slammed his computer so aggressively it instantly opened 621 like "oh shit-'
He's a furry
Who’s on first
Is that mikeburnfire and zach hazard? Not sure
I liked when he said weenor
I thought this was about Mike Burns and Zach Hazard. I am immensely disappointed.
I know everyone's talking about the video, but am I the only one who noticed MikeBurnFire in the Patreon supporters?
Oh your going to beat your chicken?
I can't I just can't with you guys 🤣🤣🤣 love the vids y'all are funny as hell
I honestly thought this was gonna include another Mike and Zach duo that I follow lmao
Hearing the start: copyright in 3-
Ok that "tag, YOUR IT!!" was genius
If this gets Copyright claimed. Please reupload with weird Al’s “eat it” it would be the best
Piemations do be a comfirmed furry. Also that's a really interesting site Mike
Waiting for ponies
I very loudly recoiled as soon as i saw e621
DON’T BEAT THE SKIM MILK
E621 tho? Good choice~
I want a Mikeburnfire crossover
e621 lmao
Me: wait what did the computer open to *sees* *happy and understanding  furry noises*
Their dialogue is in the same bpm as the song
Welp, time to lose YouTube again 😕
Huh. Mike is a furry. Neat.
I knew this was gonna be michael jackson joke
🥵🥵
Why dose this remind me of mike burn fire and Zach hazard
You guys remind me of mordicai and rigby
I like how e621 pops up on the PC IM DYING OF LAUGHTER HELP?
Imagine being these guys neighbors.
This shit made me laugh so fucking hard Xd
I laughed so hard when e621 came up haha
Dang I never really acknowledged that beat has so many definitions until this moment
I was expecting Weird Al
Fuck beat it is now meaningless
He's back
This is the funniest video on youtube ive seen
I was literally listening to Beat It this morning
ah the ending lmao  i can just imagine these two just yelling this on the side of some highway
I can't believe they beat it.
Meat Pie-mations. also I like how your computer screen opened to e621 lol.
I thought they would beat penny wise the dancing clown for the funny
"my wiener" Dumbledore said calmly
No don’t do that
"beat WHAT" *"MY MEAT"* "ah"
Why do I recognize one of the voices
shit like this is what makes me wanna get into voice acting lmao
1:11 this is now my new threat phrase
WTF E621 HE LIKES FURRY PORN HE MUST BURN
0:44 oh mah god

Why is dudes first tab open E621 🤨📸📸📸
Bro I thought the E6 thing was an edit, pleased to find out its not.
AYO 😳
This is perfect
Best shit everrrrrrrr
Wait is that the site I think it is?
WAIT, WHY DID E621 POP UP?!
Mike has an interesting site open....
Is not weird that I know what e621 is right?
This has major "Who's on First" vibes
i havent wheezed aloud at an animation in a while, this is so good
WHY!!! what's with the end
when he said "MY MEAT!" he should have  just gave him a hammer
welcome to the gulag
i like that he draws himself like his real life looks instead of a persona
I want an animated version of the bloopers.
This is like "Who's on First." but louder...
0:44 LMAO the e621tab
"Beat it" What do you mean
This is like, "who's on first?"
i love this
NO NOT E621
Uuuuuh I think I'm on the wrong website.
Triple puns are real
that ending made me spit fucke food out of my nouth
0:45 Dear God...
Beaten it to Spyro
The new “who’s on first” ladies and gentlemen.
0:44 If you know… you know…                   …and your probly are a furry.
this has me wheezing aaahhh
The small touch of E621 popping up as a third part to the beat it beat definitely beat this video out of the water
he showed his friend a video and proceeded to decide that he wanted to beat it Zach is absolutely justified here
Huh
I haven't laughed this hard form a piemations video in a long time rofl
Wtf did I just watch
ThIs iS FucKInG comEdY GoLd i TeLL yA
100%  Michael Jackson approved
yep you two and Robin are still the three funniest people on YouTube
I know Zack because of emkay and hearing him scream my cock is hilarious
I can hear the thumbnail.
e621?
Why did I watch this
So when is this getting approved for series
Who else waiting for suction cup man 5*
*looks up "e621"* OOOoooohhh... That's what that is.  *unzip*
hehehe i love knowing what popped up on his computer
Soon as I saw the title, I thought of the one Michael Jackson song that went….. Beat it!(Beat it) Beat it!(beat it)
Suction Cup Man 5 when
i want to beat to this animation
Now to do Eat It
This is a fucking masterpiece. I laughed my ass off at the end
For a solid second I thought mike and Zach from mikeburnfire was who this video was over.
wah w- what
AYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO E621
When the bloopers are the best part
MIKE NO NOT E6  Don't forget your blacklist
Missed opp. to call back Sucction Kupman and say "BEAT DEEZ NUTS!!"

This video and context is 👌👍 *French kiss* I literally grew abs from this 😂
BEAT WHAT??!  MY *MEAT.*
i should have known this was the video
SpongeBob’s my leg but replaced with mike screaming my meat and the other things he said.   Someone needs to make a video of that. XD
I bet for suction cup man episode 5
MY MMMMEEAAT!! -Hagrid said calmly
You can't have this video beat
When it said Mike and Zach, I was thinking of the two veterans who play Fallout New Vegas together.
Best short animation I've ever seen, can't stop laughing. But why did you have to make his screen pop up with THAT website?
Lmao
michol junkson
This makes me want to beat it.
When you figure out what he is gonna beat before the joke:
Can somebody tell me what is this site? 0:44
its like the 20th century beavis and butthead i both love them lol
This did not at all refer to mikeburnfire, I should've expected that, but I'm still disappointed.
Lol
What did I just witness
Damn he had saul gone on his homescreen
You got me.
Mike has good taste! In Music and Websites!
I love this so much holy shit
He had e621 on his computer
alternate title: skim milk 2
0:45 WO WO WO WO EY EY EY EY
Love the e261 detail
imagine what the neighbors were thinking lol
He opened E621 I'm fucking dying!
lol
Mlp videos
Wait so whose on first?
the ending credits were just as funny as the video itself. also THAT WEBSITE IS CURSED
Oh no, not the forbidden e621, he would never beat it to that would he?
Can we please get more suction cups man
E621:DD
0:45 he s going to some dark places...
nawh not e621 bruh 💀
Mikeal Zachson.
Oh god oh fuck it’s the funny website
Not THE Mike & Zach I was expecting, sir. My disappointment is immeasurable
Ahh the modern classic Who's on First.
Whenever I hear mike and zach I always think of mikeburnfire
Oh dear, I recognized the website he brought up and know why he thinks it's a video game :)
Lol dude loaded up e621
BEAT IT BEAT WHAT? DEEZ NU-
I saw that website man of class I see
yo this guy is a furry
AINT NO WAYYYYYYYYY HE WENT ON E621
The video is fucking amazing but the after credits make it so much better
I love it!
I was confused and thought this was a mikeburnfire video
Bruh
i can't not listen to zachs voice just repetdly say  "welcome back to emkay"
they knew exactly what they were doing
E6 LMAOOOOOO i love you guys
As soon as I saw the title + thumbnail, I said "Oh no" xD
Alright fes up.. we all know someone out there made those takes their ringtone.... who done lmao
The e621 homepage though X3
The funny letters and numbers website
2020s’ Eddsword, folks!
Mike's a furry, because of course he is
Zach is a furry. What fursona he iss hmm
"many people beat their meat, but only few can defeat it."  ~some guy
e621  perfection.
*looks at the website that appeared on the desktop*  ….i am sickened. But curious.
Well he casually opened E621. Furry confirmed.
The thumbnail and title out of context is all i need
That was beautiful
The "Tag! You're it!" line is so clever. Beat (it) where the (it) is (you), because (you) are (it), a.k.a. "you're it"
e621, always seeing it
I've never laughed so hard at the concept of someone tugging their pud.
beat is a ok song i woulden't say it's my go to mj song
Great video, but what was that cool game he was playing?
I saw the joke from a mile away but I still couldn’t stop laughing after the delivery
E621????
I like how they added the outtakes and we got to hear the laughs at the end
The second hand embarrassment lmao
my curiosity led me to the hollow discouragement, i shouldn't have discover what that site have been
Oj
Lets see he is a spyro fan is a chronic beater and uses e621 and possibly puts Spyro in the search bar. Thats it I am suing you for using me without my permission
lryics: beat it beat it beat it beat it
Okie I hav to ask.. wat are u looking up on that website...I know that site..
Beat your meat like for cooking?
Out of all the sites chosen, it was the one of my people .. e621
LMAO
beat it
This video has been left un-beaten, it's that good
I saw that screen flicker 😏
aw hell nah not the furry website
wonder if he ever beat that game?
The sheriff hayseed plushs cameo is really cute!
😆😆I couldn't STOP LAUGHING WHEN THE E.621 showed up 😂🤣
1:12 penis punch
Pff, the e621 gag is great. Also neat little Sherriff Hayseed plushes on the bookshelf
My man's fr had e621 on his bookmarks. What dedication.
I have noticed the computer that said e621 it's a furry porn site known as Yiff my guy the one that was going to beat his meat is a furry my guy
Alright that was clever
Yo why he pull up the e621??
I woke up at 6:37AM to see this. What a way to start the morning.
The phrase “beat it” has so many meanings that it can make 2 homies beat it.
LMFAO E621
this video didn't beat around the bush. a masterpiece as always!
Did anyone notice Todd Hayseed and Shawn in the background
0:57 Why does Zach look like me here>
This is amazing
Don't we all beat it? Just beat it?
A certain funky webside automatically turning on was a gorgeous add on
This gives me so many questions...   _What's Zach's favorite song?_  *Does any of them both ever watched **_THAT,_** if so, they did watch any of my art I've been doing the last 8 years?*  (You can answer question 2 as your opinion. No need to be shy.)
WAIT THATS DAMIEN FROM EMKAY wait I'm dumb
Yup, amazing
I needed this
At first i thought Mikeburnfire would somehow be in this vid.  Because of the names but nevermind  Is he a e621 furry?
This radiates skim milk energy love it
Oh... I too like "Beat It" by Michael Jackson
Casually opens e621. (Noice)
Is this what happens when an experiment group Is cut off from civilization for long intervals of time?
Please DO NOT announce to the server when you are going to beat it. This has been a reoccurring issue, and I’m not sure why some people have such under developed social skills that they think that a server full of mostly male strangers would need to know that. No one is going to be impressed and give you a high five (especially considering where that hand has been). I don’t want to add this to the rules, since it would be embarrassing for new users to see that we have a problem with this, but it is going to be enforced as a rule from now on.  If it occurs, you will be warned, then additional occurrences will be dealt with at the discretion of modstaff. Thanks.
e621 lmao
when i saw E621 i fucking SCREAMED.
1:13 POV: you have FAILED the VIBE CHECK.
I love seeing two men beat it
I love this vid
i got jump scared by the e621 homepage but then remembered all the my little pony shit that Mike has made and all the crap on that site so i think that just makes sense
OOHHHHH MY GOD THAT'S E621 AT 0:44
MY CHOICE
BEAT IT, JUST BEAT IT
Now this is my kind of video
At least now we know ONE of them is normal
These are always worth the wait, love it
This was a rollercoaster and I loved it
how is this video monetized
0:45 forgot piemation is a furry
beat it eat it beat it eat it
incredible, such bold art
love how even when I don't have volumes on piemations videos with subs still got me dying
Beat it.
0:53 notice 👌👌
0:45 Ayo
Not the best Mike and Zach I've ever seen,  burnfire for life.
E621 LMAO
Piemations, yeaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh

No one wants to beat it
Is this what a fever dream is
*I knew we we're gonna go here... I just knew...*
I also want to beat it
1:50 Had me dying 😂
i wish i am in scened graed but now i am in first gade
This video almost killed me it needs a this video is extremely funny and may make you choke on air from laughing too hard you have been warned disclaimer
This was out of context.
Don’t worry Zack addictions are tough if we work together we can beat it
This was an absolute masterpiece xdxd
I'm sensing a communication break down. Or perhaps a communication beat down.
e621, what a beautiful website...i mean amazing chemical compound...yeah...
THE E621 OH MY GOD
0:44 e621, huh? Are we having furries here?
I thought the tissues should have explained it all. Lmao 🤣
This level of comedy is unbeatable
😳🤨
didn't know you could beat it by beating it and still make it out with nobody having beat it.
So we need this Mike and Zach to meet post apocalypse Mike and Zach it would seem
When is suction cup man 5
Wow, whatever they're talking about sure sounds hard. I hope they beat it so they can relieve each other again!
I genuinely thought it was about Michael Jackson, and the fact it actually was makes me happy that im not down bad.
I want the full song yo :0
I love this
oh no e621
I expected two things from that thumbnail... And both scenarios were absolutley correct
Me seeing e621  OOHH
Man, if there is ever an opportunity to be able a voice a character for these guys, I'd take it and beat it
IT is my favorite movie! Thanks for referencing it!
The website choice could be worse But it's still awful
0:45
MY MEAT
That was amazing
😂😂😂😂😂 THE MOMENT HE BROUGHT OUT THE FUCKING LOTION!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
Quite the good taste in websites
Are you talking about Zac burns fire?
Those who don't know: 🙂 Those who do know: 😐
Just beat it!
WHAT DID I JUST LISTEN TO 😟
hee hee
I was gonna make a funny joke but somebody *beat* me to it
This had ME beating my desk
Love the all the little references like Spyro, nothing could beat it
Imagine having this full blast in public XD
This made my day..been having nightmares about Poppy playtime and its dark theory of orphaned children being turned into toys (Ik its not real people so hush XD)   But this is funny shit XD You guys made my day
That homepage both made me laugh and feel ashamed.
never ask someone to help beat it
Excuse me? 🤨📸
MIKE IS A FURRY
i saw a meme about the computer and I didn't actually fucking expect it to be *the site*
Mike is a furry canon
Nothing can beat, beat it. Now beat it because I have to beat it.
Not what I was expecting. I was expecting them to fight a sentient fridge… anyway time to beat it!
BEAT ISN’T A WORD ANYMORE
e621 popping up was...   *mwah* Chef's Kiss.
the thumbnail made it worse
E621, aye? I like ur style
Bro I knew that song was gonna be used.
After searching up e621 I am indefinitely traumatized
I just thought of something is this a reference to mikeburnsfire YouTube channel or is this an independent idea?
The unscripted yelling at the end gave off epic Game Grubs vibes.
0:44 I'm not ever going to tell you why I laughed here.
How the hell do you guys manage to make a Zach and Mike with Mike and Zach so effortlessly, and yet have those guys at mikeburnfire have no clue or relation to Mike and Zach whatsoever?
0:44 na bro how many people actually understand that one
I lost it when e621 opened 🤣🤣
Was... was that e621?
This is on par with the Skim milk gag all those years ago
They're such good roommates.
Do you think Mike beats to fanart of his characters or nah?
That site lmao
Ayo the e621 tab tho 🤣🤣
*BEAT IT DAMMIT*
funny i like
The legend returns!!!
mike is a furry?
The fact that it was e621
The e261 💀
E621 nice choice to just beat it to. Ok well I’m going to beat it.
Seems like a dirty version of who's on first
can i beat it with you guys
mike just fucking dies at the end 💀
"MY MEAT" got me dead
Ahh, the funny blue website...
Bru why is this Soo funny
Wheezing does not begin to describe my condition.
This is a good video, alright, imma go beat it
Mikeburnfire
A wise man once said "MY MEAT"
This really just took me and didn't stop.
NOOO!!! NOT e621!!! 😭😭😭😭😂😂
Something about "Tag, you're it!" **horrendous punch to the face** is just gonna stay with me forever.
That Thumbnail was D I V I N E
LMAOOOOOOOOO
Man, I wonder how I'm gonna beat it.
Real homies help fellow homies with beating their meat.
Chaos
i was hoping to hear mike just scream "MY SHLONG!!!!"
OMFG NOT E621
I saw the title and immediately thought My Meat Michael Jackson
fuck did i just watch bro lmao
Simply amazing
Imagine what the neighbors are hearing
The fact that the song wa my Ford though is great, good to see that's what happens
OMFG XD
Brooo the E621 pop up got me dead XD
neat website
oh crap i finally understand what mike is tryna do XD
help
Personally, I'd help him beat it. Never leave a homie hanging.
I hope he beats his Game
ahaha e621
Wait.. MIKE’S A FURRY ALL OF THE SUDDEN?
Not the funny msg website 😭😭😭
whats going on
"I can't beat anything until you BEAT IT!" Had me rolling xD
Haven’t watched you since your fnaf 3 animation. But the moment I saw this I died 🤣🤣🤣
Zach hazard?
That was funny
Sheriff hayseed in the back :D
0:45 I know what that it is another “beat it joke”, but is that a symbol or a made-up character on the screen? I’m genuinely curious.
Mike is a furry confirmed?
They really did beat it.
*Please be careful to keep your hands and dick away from panes of glass, Mike.*
I LOLed
I LOVE THIS LMAO
I regret living watching this video. Nothing can beat that feeling
ohhhhhh hahaha cuz the horses name was friday
Now that you seen this comment BEAT IT
You guys never fail to make us laugh.
More suction cup man please!!!!
I like the Tod Hayseed plushies, His decorations beat mine.
Hearing Mike scream "My meat" over and over again is perfect
MMMMYYYYY        MMMEEEAAATTT!!!!!!!
DELICIOUS NEW PIEMATIONS VIDEO MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!
relatable
Rolf omy God...
I can't breathe
I like the Spyro statue in the background
1:51 shouldve used this one tbh 😂
This video proved to me that there’s definitely only one definition of beat it
i saw e621 then had that harrowed feeling
September bro
Is Mikeburnfire and piemations the same people?
Those outtakes are hilarious
The outtakes are so genuinely beautiful, thank you for including them
this is not fallout
Я не понял, но как бы понял
nice ending :)
this could've gone much worse if weird al was involved
Just beat it!
I can’t imagine being this guy’s neighbor and hearing him scream this shit
The Todd stuffies and the "innocent" site.... hmmmm I wonder what minor cultural subsect of the internet he could belong to...
Give 5am at Freddy’s
MY MEAT!!!
What website is that? Looks cute
From Michael Jackson to Leaving to Masturbation. Good god, this was hilarious. XD
Unbeatable.
No one wants to be defeated!
Yes
One of these was just "Beet it"
I’ll never read “Piemations” the same way ever again, thanks.
beat it
lol
xDDD
The gag would have been funnier if he pulled out raw meat and a meat hammer
Mike is canonically a furry
I love this animation style.
Funni
Zach: I can help you beat it Mike: *look of disgust n horror*
This is the video you send to your friend when they've been texting you all day
this does not feel like 2 minutes but it is
I understood what Mike really meant by "Beat it" the exact moment before his screen flashed to the e621 page
I clicked for the title and im not dissapointed
Heh e621
Also Zach being wholesomely oblivious is great
Best one yet. I don't think anything can beat it.
The blue art website  owo
I god I wish I have a friend like you two 🤣😂😂
Skim milk energy
Lol
The ad I got said beat it
0:57 silence:.............
0:55 MY MEAAAAAAAT
The animation is solid.  I wish this was funny
They can thank Michael Jackson later…
Yo why was Mike on e621?
Died of laughter when the screen came on
MY MEAT
ok
Ok. This one was funny... now BEAT IT!
Can I beat it?
So we go from them trying to defeat a sentient printer...to beating it....man this is truly comedy
so............did they beat it?
HEY I WROTE YOU A SONG! IT GOES  A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS! BEAT IT!
Pie Mation loves to beat it ;D
I totally beat it to this video
Just guys on a regular basis
*Piemations is like Christmas. It comes around once a year and everyone loves it.*
Classy
can't wait for these new alpha betas additions...
This is definitely a 4am discussion that happened to be recordee
Now that's not how your supposed to "beat it!" I've said to much might as well "beat it!" Scary Tall Vampire Lady should probably "beat it!"
Imagine this as an actual conversation with a friend
Did your neighbors hear these?  That's gotta be hilarious
If you dont know what website was on his computer, I recommend NOT googling it.
Only a selct group knew what website that was XD
I could not stop laughing after the out takes 🤣
I don't like the idea of Mike immediately wanting to beat it after explaining to his friend why he likes a song
LMFAO
Perfect
Pony
I know this men did not just pull up e621
uhhhhh
e621 😈
WHY E6 🤣😭
1:12 tag YOUR *IT*
I saw the e621 furry  on his screen
So this is what they do in there spare time, confuse themselves with the context of the phrase “beat it”
Ah. Good ol' e621.
Brb losing my fucking mind over this video
BRO THERE IS E621
e621 in a piemations vid
First half the video: actual animation. Second half of the video: different ways to say what "it" will they "beat".
I'm sure the neighbors were happy. XD
I didn't  notice what site he was going on until my 3rd watch through XD
Praying that everyone falls asleep quickly and has a peaceful sleep. Hope you all wake up happy and well rested 🍍🍍
egg
Interesting
“My Meat”
Why the hell does everyone create shorts no matter how many times a kid watches these
BBBBB       EEEEEEE           A         TTTTTTTT                  IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII      TTTTTTTT B          B    E                     A   A              TT                                IIII                     TT BBBBB       EEEEEEE      AAAAA           TT                                 IIII                     TT B          B    E                 A           A          TT                                IIII                     TT BBBBB       EEEEEEE   A             A         TT                         IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII             TT
soooooo, where's the full cover of Beat It?
This really reminds me of the skim milk video
MY VEGAN MEAT!
My favorite expressions in this style are when characters lose their eyebrows altogether.
0:44 NOOOOOO DEAR GOD NOOO WHYYY DEAR GOD WHY NO NO NO NOOO NOOO
1:12
Beat it just beat it
The people who know the website know
Love this little funny characters. Love them. ❤
SATISFYING to watch. 1:12
This made me LAUGH and i also didn't expect THAT 1:12
Zach looks like Jontron now.
mmmmhm, nothing beats being pegged
xD too funny
We need more bloopers lmao
Title made me think of mikeburnfire
This has the same vibes as the skim milk video
hey its been like forever when is there going to be A second episode of that westren I got A good laugh from the first
That Was Funny Everyone! Beat It me
cant wait for the weird al parody "lyle and mack eat it"
love seeing e6 there
This video was so cool Im going to beat it
Pfffffttttt
Hehe funny blue site
Aye nothing wrong with helping your homies beat it
Wait a minute is Mike a furry?!
I bet the recording process was amazing
I love your animations and I really love the rest of the takes. They're so funny! I couldn't stop laughing to the point that my sides hurt! 🤣
This is just beatiful.
0:44 mike?
I love the takes at the end of the video
I'm clearly messed up because I saw the e621 home page in the background.
Hilarious
That blue and yellow "funny" e site tho
Zack a furry confirmed I saw that e621 tab
This gives suction cup man vibes
Finally, someone utilizing Mike and Zach for something more than obscure gun facts.
Almost as great as Skim Milk
This was wonderful and I get what you're doing there also congrats on trending
A dicks sporting goods ad played after this video. YouTube knows what's up-
I’ll give this video an 10/10   However I will have to doc -2 point for no “PIEMATIONS YEAAAH!!” So your final score is a 8/10, a B for Beat! Good Job!
e621? Relatable :)
Dude, why is this funny
The damn e621 screen 😭😭😭
The tag your it was absolutely perfect
Same energy as "I'M AT SOUP!"
Blue site, nice~
*IM GONNA STICK MY MEAT IN THE SKIM MILK!*
Densest organism known to man
i love what the desktop went to
I think he wants us to beat it.
Bro this is funny.
Love it hahahahahah.....
The absolute best thing about this is that there was next to no acknowledgment of the e621 joke, except for the context that it was pretty much definitely pron, leading to a very solid "If you know, you know" situation that would have been avoided if they used the Hub. Well executed.
When he pulled out the tissues I was like: 🤯
There are some times when I forget Pie is a furry. Thanks for the reminder
Great video! Hilarious!
Why is this on trending lmaooo
Why is Zach, the snack beating it?
I appreciate that a lot of time and work went into this animation, which is why I regret I must inform you that you have posted cringe.
Beatus Skeetus Deletus browsing history
the “MY MEAT!!!!” was perfect
Welcome to the family son.
The e621 pop up on the computer was perfect!
the funniest part has to be the budget cover of Michael Jackson’s ‘Beat It’
Really?
Beat
almost the same aura as "I'M AT SOUP"
Ok now that's Funny XD That *Blue* Website tho O_O
Why e6
I knew it.

The e621 bit had me cryin dear lord 😂
The little Todd and Saun cameo

Bro the e621 got me lmao
Perfection
This is the soup store all over again VIETNAM FLASHBACKS
My life
This is too good
@mikeburnfire and @Zach Hazard
The jokes were hilarious, but the e621 bit was THE BEST.
Video idea: Mike and Zach out pizza the hut
E621 XD
This song beats it more than my dad beat me
Bruh
Are these 2 gay or are they just roomies
"beat It, don't make me repeat It" -Michael Jackson
Amazing video of beating it
1:50 this one makes me laugh super hard
Welp Beat it. Just Beat it. Be a man and Beat it (Episode 2 of "Mike & Zach, Beat it" this episode they both get confused by that single sentence)
i love the fact they pulled up 621...
Funniest one ever like fr bro lol
More suction cup man when?
No one's gonna talk about e621 appearing on his screen?
We need a cover of Beat it by Mike and Zach
The recording session must've been _veeerry_ awkward for the neighbors... 😐
they do what??
"My meat!" - Pen, Pie, Mike, that guy.
Bruh, why e621? is mike a furry?
Have some more chicken, have some more pie, it doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried.
You know. I have a funny story…  You see, One time I went to see a Michael Jackson impersonator. The last song he played… BEAT IT!  I don’t know. Sounded funny to me.
accurate
oh no no
0:44 😐
Is it bad that the first thought was going to be a [Master - Beatier] joke
IM WHEEZING, THIS IS GOLDEN
0:44 thats not a game
Jesus died for your justification and rose again for the forgiveness of your sins, Repent and believe the Gospel.
Why is thisso funny
Special shoutout to Mike Ox.
E
not the european code for glutamate!
Alright know beat it
They look ugly
Was not expecting to hear "MY   W E I N E R" at the end and lost it
*sees e621* *proceeds to spit out drink* mike is canonically a furry?
i dont get it
Why are the outtakes funnier than the actual skit? God, my humor is trash...
He a furry officially
this is amazing i love it thank you for continuing your awesome videos
babe wake up Piemations posted again
The yelling was so crisp I felt like I was there with him
The laugh in the background in the end was gold.
WHY DOES ZACH SOUND SO MUCH LIKE DOUG DOUG
Another masterpiece of a video 👌👌
Mike is a furry confirmed?
The greatest detail in this is that e-621 pops up on his pc
He should have just beat it
ah yes when  mike beat his desk and e621 open i fucking laughed
I'm glad this was exactly what i thought it was going to be when i read the title.
Kinda reminds me of don't fuck the skim milk
Love it
Man, your throat must have hurt like hell after all those takes.
Ayo Mikeburnfire supports one of my favorite animators!  Also I swear youre becoming more and more unhinged as time goes on and I am here for it
“Who’s on first?” Vibes
The website....
"Piemations, yeaaah*gets beaten by a pie*"

Jesus Christ that was good. And the furry website too, God damn
ah yes. best reference. e6
The Spyro figurine at 0:38!
THIS MAN NEVER DISAPPOINTS US TO MAKE US LAUGH 😂😂😂

Ah, monosodium glutamate...  Man of culture
I like how mike opens e621
Yell me Ding Dong or WeWe, or my xD I can't I keep laughing from saying another suggestion
Thanks for the Vid!
huh
ahhhh...what
0:45  *looks at monitor*  Mick no
The legend never ends
Zach is a great representation for autistic people who have no clue what a social que even is
Bruh
Thanks for including the outtakes. 😂🤣😂🤣
From the staring I was laughing up until the end I was dying of laughter.
Whatchu mean by that?
damn, dude just pulls up 621 right then and there
never fail to make me laugh XD
"I'm gonna beat it", pops up e621.I am dying from leafter
zach is the most inocent person alive
actually serious question regarding e621, is pretzel the bird actually piemations character?  edit: yes... yes it is or someone is impersonating him(?)
It took me a second to realise what Mike was talking about also the outtakes were so HILARIOUS XD
Just listened to Al’s eat it.
Rofl 🤣 😂 🤣 😂 🤣
I noticed that certain website, don't think I missed it 🧐
As soon as I saw the Spyro figure in the background I somehow knew exactly what he was gonna beat it to. What I wasn't expecting was that I was gonna be proven right so quickly.
Homie didn't even get on rule34, he got the whole e621... oh nahhh!! 😨😨
My favorite website
*pulls up E621*  Me: oh no...
what a curious blue and yellow website on that there screen :^)
THE INFAMOUS E621 POP UP HIT ME LIKE MIKE TYSON 🤣
He really be having his desktop open on e621 xD
Where’s furry??
That just happened
*meanwhile next door*
Fucking gold
ee sips tuenti oan XD
This feels like a conversation I would have with my friend Geno, but he can beat it after this
The tag was a smart move
Is that e621 on his computer screen that's funny lol
ngl, its hot watching 2 guys beating their meat in public  Hibachi-Steakhouse duo restaurants should really invest in better ventilating
*wtf was that on the screen?*
ima upload this to "the hub"
Ah yes, if it isn't the blue site
OMG THE OUT TAKES ABSOULTLY KILLED ME LAMOOO
Wait why did he open e621 Wonder what his blacklist looks like
.... Best it.... Just b- HAHAHAHA
The fact that mike was on e621…
The one time I come back to Piemations after Suction Cup Man and I see the holy archives of e6
some things will always be funny
What do Alexander the Great and Winnie the Pooh have in common?      Same middle name.
Huh never thought ima see that Image from here
I saw that site 😜
I agree to his choices
Saying "beat it" in a game of tag is my new way of asserting dominance
Is no one going to talk about the "you're it" pun at the end? That was good.
the e621 on his computer lmaoo
Mike confirmed to be a furry Lmao   Haha e621
Making a salad that will be the best. No one will beet it.
Beat what? I don't know! Third base!
wait til they find out about eat it
Beat it
0:44 If ya know ya know
great stuff, MY MEAT. Good luck with nofap september
Who’s on first
MSG hmm
Heh that website looks very familiar my guy😏
Great animation, but why was there monosodium glutamate on his monitor
Skim milk flashbacks
Look, Mike if it makes you feel better, we'll all beat it and then eat it too.
I can't express how much this made me laugh
why does Mike and Zach look like early game Grumps.
0:45 Is... Is that e621?
*THEY WHAT NOW?!*
0:45 I know he’s a furry but there was no hiding that
Masterbeat
Ayo. I saw that. 👀 That "game"
Someone dub the "MY MEAT" screams into Dragon Ball.
If you know you know
I have been on e621 before i been looking at katia managan the khajiit a lot and Xenomorph and good art work and i hate artists picture they leave i feel heart broken
1 minute of pure comedy, then 1 more minute of purer comedy. 👌
XD
This was truly great and I love it
0:44 I see you a man Of Culture too.
So... Is Mike a furry?
E621 has left unrepairable marks on my brain
The outtakes are fucking gold
Yes
This was hilarious lmao
That's obviously the BlackGryphon cover, sounds just like him x3
This is hilarious. I remember the Skim Milk animation. That one is still hilarious too. 🤣
Later on:  Mike, holding an ice pack to his eye: You could've just said I overdid it you know Zach: [rubs back of neck in guilt] Yeah, you're rig- [narrows eyes in realization] Wait, so that wordplay _WAS_ ON PURPOSE?? Mike: I'M A COMEDY WRITER ZACH WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT FROM ME
How can a man be so pure, so unaware of the horrors
I hate myself for not being able to animate a 13 years old, I feel like I'll never amount to anything
All our times have come Here but now they're gone Seasons don't fear the reaper Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain We can be like they are Come on baby (Don't fear the reaper) Baby take my hand (Don't fear the reaper) We'll be able to fly (Don't fear the reaper) Baby i'm your man La la la la la La la la la la Valentine is done Here but now they're gone Romeo and Juliet Are together in eternity (Romeo and Juliet) 40,000 men and women everyday (Like Romeo and Juliet) 40,000 men and women everyday (Redefine happiness) Another 40,000 comin everyday (We can be like they are) COme on baby (Don't fear the reaper) Baby take my hand (Don't fear the reaper) We'll be able to fly (Don't fear the reaper) Baby i'm your man La la la la la La la la la la Love of two is one Here but now they're gone Came the last night of sadness And it was clear she couldn't go on Then the door was open and the wind appeared The candles blew and then disappeared The curtains flew then he appeared (Saying don't be afraid) Come on baby (And she had no fear) And she ran to him (Then they started to fly) They looked backward and said goodbye (She had become like they are) She had taken his hand (She had become like they are) Come on baby (Don't fear the reaper)
0:45 🤨📸
*MY MEAT*
MY MEAAAT!?!?!!?!!!
i love mike and zach, they’re a good comedy duo
Not e6 open on the computer 😭
I just realized: at the end, Zach tags Mike as “it” because he’s gonna beat “it.”
If I had a nickel for every youtube duo with the name Mike and Zach, I'd have two  Which isn't a whole lot, but it's weird there's two
The moment the computer turned on, that killed me.
Congratulations on getting to be the #13 on Trending
the screen turn on had me laughing not going to lie
They both can beat it together tho.
MMMYYy mMMmehehehe
Zack yelling “MY FAT FUCKING COCK” is the funniest thing ive heard in ages lol
E621?    sly
I'm not shocked by the Piemations e621 tag, I am shocked by its contents. Godspeed lil bird dude.
Imagine hearing someone say “MY MEAT”
the bloopers 😂
0:45 Looks like a cool website you’ve got there Mike.
Ey, E621! Glad to see you old friend!
This really had me giggling, love what comes up on the computer when he slams the desk
I have never laughed so hard at a man yelling "MY MEAT!" P.S. Mike lowkey deserved that punch bahahahaha
I KNEW IT FURRYRYYYYY
that site though.  *sweats nervously*
0:44  E621 appearing made me bust out laughing bro I was NOT ready!
I have been watching this channel for years and I believe this has finally reached it's "point" of what was the last thing in My childhood before growing up and started to "beat it" as a teenager
Beat it~!!!!
Someone should make a version of this but every time he says "beat it" it plays a vine boom sound
#13 on trending xD
This is my second time watching this.  Jesus christ seeing e621 in a video really made me lose it. I didn't see it at first (I usually get a different character on the screen) and god just.... I expected it to be a blurred image at first
Hahahahaha oh my god that is gold ok now all of u guys beat it
When I saw e621 I gasped
I love how this video included every single joke I was expecting from the title XD
Oh.. the website... oh... oh no
Abbott and Castello for Zoomers
Hope your ears feel better.
MY MEAT
0:45     Remember. Piemations has stated before he’s a furry.   And he’s showing the funny salt website.
i love the re-watch because then you realise that zach was half wrong, but the full blame should be put on the English language
MEN
This was fast  Humor amazing work I loved the tag your hit
We need more Mike and Zach!
Spyro lmao and also, who beats their balls??
E621 based
Epic.
I can't blame Zach for punching you though...also this is stupidly hilarious for no reason.
but....did he beat it?
Loved the little spyro
Amazing
this is the case of how idiots argue with each other
Was that e621 in the background
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽🖕🏽👎🏽🖕🏽👎🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽
hm creative... I think?
E621? Well then didn't know we are still getting furry jokes
wrong website
0:45 e621, Mike is a furry confirmed.
Full Beat It cover when?
It is impossible to keep a straight face in the presence of one or more kittens.
God I never felt so happy in my whole life this is so beautiful
Nothing could ever *beat* this animation style
MY MEAT!! xD
you ever realize that the only reason you aren't a furry is because of the stigma around the term, anyways loved the e621 reference!
St. Joseph terror of demons pray for us..
Please Pray the Rosary & Devine Mercy Chaplet to free all countries from war, hunger, calamities, corruption, abortion, divorce, drugs, pornography, homosexuality, slavery, communism and all evils.pls. pray for peace and joy on all families and homes...

AMEN... ..
You guys are incredibly hilarious voice-acting Zach and Mike.
i'm sorry, but did i just see e621... nice    -monosodium glutamate-
Mike is a furry. Confirmed.
..........................................................................................................................best joke ever, fuck you
Only enough these two remind me of mikeburnfire and Zach hazard. They have similarly established personalities and they're both comedic duos
0:50 is the most precious frame I have ever seen.
I don’t know what concerns me more The fact that piemations knows what e621 is Or the fact that *I* know what e621 is
Mike strokin his shit?!
MY MEAT GODDAMNIT!
0:45 hmmm...
its just a funny blue website
I went to far down the YouTube rabbit hole there’s no escape now lol
0:55 MY MEAT XD
Who’s on first
Thought it was a Michael Jackson parody song for a second.
I'm crying
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
...I vocally when...  "whhhhooooooooOOOOOOOAAAaaa..." at the e621...  people are going be ruined...
Monosodium glutamate.
Many beat their meat, but none defeat it.
THIRD BASE!
Ok but who’s on first
Same energy as "you f@ck skim milk"
I love this humor my god
This is legitimately one of the best videos I have seen in a long time. Everything is so perfectly done
Just do an entire video of outtakes!
Haha, e621 go brrrrrr
the e621 was a nice tuch
0:44  oh...oh No.
E621.....good shit
Everything sank when i saw the pc light up.
Zach might be the most smartest guy that ever lived
E621 lmao
I am losing it, this went VERY far, VERY VERY FAST
Oh this is a different Zack and Mike.
Holy heck the e621 fought me so off guard
1:48 send this to someone with *no context*
This is singlehandedly the most stupid video I have ever seen on this platform and any other. I fucking love it.
Kkkkkkkkkkk
Him opening up e621getting ready to beat it was underappreciated I feel.
The website 😭
YES FINIALY
My heart beat stopped when e621 came on screen
I'm pretty sure you guys just beat Abbott & Costello's "Who's on First" skit.   And to those of you who know what that is, congratulations. You are not uncultured philistines.
ah yes, monosodium glutamate. truly a choice pick of websites to use.
I want to imagine their neighbors being very concerned about them yelling about beating each other, and then specifying it being their weiner, and just a casual "ohhhh, okay" before they return to their daily activities.
This is a crazy ahh video
1:41 for some reason, I want to see a animation of a accident, whatever it might be, and someone just screaming this 🤣 I'm losing it lol. Also "hotdog- MC - Shlong" is what my brain came up with through that. 🤔
Hold on is that mike and zach from mikeburnfire?
Thanks for this.
was gonna make a joke but people beat me to it
Now that there's a whole animation team, there's no way to know who's responsible for the half second of e621.  How fiendish.
This was the dumbest shit ever and I love it
*shows e621* I feel personally attacked.
This has the same energy as the "Skim milk" animation that was done
have some more chicken have some more pie
Bro you gotta link to the audio
Ah, I see Mike is a man of culture
Still not a family art style change
e621...
im so glad the room isn't filled with poptarts anymore, haha, unless...
Your poor neighbors.
I-
I do appreciate it when blatant hypocrisy is treated so swiftly.
I...I am so confused
The next vid need to be just called eat it, nothing has changed just all the characters are voiced by weird al
Yup putting that last bit as my ringtone.     So glad I don't have an office job anymore.
one of your finest videos
"I'M GONNA BEAT MY MEAT RIGHT HERE ON THIS SEAT AS I LOOK AT FURRY FEET ON THE INTERNEET"
Beat it
This was an absolute treasure!
Opens E621 with INTENT.
mum just entered to the "my meat" takes and we both starte laughing
Everything about this short is incredible, no wonder so many takes had to be recorded
Mike and Zach is the best
Hey! The donkey and fox thing!
I feel sorry for your voice after saying all those slangs for penis.
The end sounds like outakes for "Shut Up!"
You can't beat a new Piemations upload on a weekend.
What in the funk did I just watch
MEAT
finally, a new video i hope you make suction cup man 5 or 6 idk i lost count but i hope you make it soon
I’m gonna beat it        wanna see it?
Oh shit, their going to beat it..
I called this a classic until e621 popped up on his screen...
I got a notification but how tf didn’t I see this video
I can obviously see why he wants him to beat it.. (the get out beat it I mean...)
This would be awkward to watch after beating it...
Tag
Good ole pie nations.
E621 popping up made me cry oml
mike goes on e621 (real)
🪘
Wow. If I had a nickel for everytime a pair of friends named Mike and Zach posted videos about them in dumb situations with one of them getting injured, I'd have two nickels.....  Which is a lot.
what the heck did i just watch
What the ever loving ponytails in a pot of soup which a witch eats did i watch
Did...did e621 pop up on the screen when he hit the desk? LOL
I can't take how much I love and hate this
great video love it dude
I was patiently waiting for the masturbation joke It came quicker than I expected
Hilarious
for the life of me, i still think this is the same Zach and Mike from mikeburnfire
sweet, you guys are still active
It's crazy how close this is to what my roommate and I do
I saw e621
1:36 wait a minute, is that THE Mike burnfire?
MMmmmmm Yes very good choice of website
i am so confused
Interesting website
Pfft- God dang it, I need to make the "MY MMMMEAT!!" my ringtone. Gonna have a laugh at random places, XD
So basically Mike needs Zach to beat it in order to beat it
literally me
The deliver is so damn good. You two are very good at it. Awesome animation!
Why is this video so good
Fucking e621 bahahaha
Ah yes the funny website :)
Who's on first?
E 6 2 1 ! ?
I greatly enjoyed this
0:44 What a cool character, I wonder where it's from?
I imagine Mike’s neighbors must have an interesting time hearing them yell “MY WEINER” all day
Why is two grown men screaming my meat so godamn funny
please make this a meme!
The freaking bloopers were an entirely different comedy video on their own
I counted 23 times they said "Beat it"
this is fucking great I don't see anything beating it any time soon
Nice, I like they're facial expressions 🙂 👍
Kinda crazy to think if MIcheal Jackson didn't exist neither would this channel...
i have waited forever for another mike and zach, thanks much needed
0:55 BEAT MY MEAT NOW !!!
hahaha funny 621 number
It just gets better and better, love this, favorite video on YouTube
I thought the e621 was an edit and not on the original 💀
Take a shot every time they say beat it
What
LMAOOO
that was AMAZING
I wasnt strong enough.. ...e621 gag beat me
Lame.
Oh, he's gonna beat his meat because he is gonna watch.........HENTIA!?
cool
this is funny
What
The e621 tab fucking killed me
e621
I’m beyond saddened by the fact I know what e621 is.
I feel like I am beating it
Your neighbors must love y’all lmfao, this was great
You knew what you were doing when you made that thumbnail
Holy shit, he's going to beat it!
"I'll help you beat it." At that, I just couldn't stop laughimg like crazy!
Just beat it
I’m sad i know that website
The fuckin e6
Nothing beats the meat.
Ew, he beats it to furries.
Haha, funny, Mike is gonna beat it to- * Sees the website * 😶 _oh no_
This has no right to be funny, but it is! xD
The end part was so fucking funny and VERY clever in the way he tagged him said he was it and then punched him
It wasn't the hand lotion that told me what Mike was going to beat;     It was e621
BEAT IT
too much beats in one video
BEAT IT 🤔
Mike looks like a young Tom Scott
He got beated
That E621 pop up was priceless
1:32-1:53 play it 2x speed🤣🤣
Never before have I ever been so amused at a man screaming MY MEAT over and over again...
the myth the legend himself is back
Ahhhhhh Of course. E.621..... Is this a confession?
0:45 Ladies and gentlemen, we got em! :3
NOT THE E6 PAGE 😭😭😭😭😭
hahaha that sgreat xD the "tag your it" actually made me laugh.
amazing.
Homies help homies, always
casual e621
This was hilarious cuz, keep it up man
Aannd there's e621 all of a sudden XD
0:45 a man of the culture I see
vulgar whos on first
Beat It
Look, this video got a good laugh out of me but I'm massively dissapointed that half of its runtime is outtakes and credits.
I didnt know i wanted this til i saw it
ah yes, nothing beats e621 at being the best site to beat it to
Absolutely un-beat-able
This gives off the same energy as the skim milk video. Also, love the Todd in the background. I don't remember if it's spelt Shawn or Sean but shout out to him too
For a 1 minute video I was fucking dying of laugher lmaoooo
Did you put the swearing at the end so it wouldnt be tagged for kids?
I knew by the thumbnail and title what was gonna happen
Before i watch, what game is 'it?' Is it it's own game? Is it another thing? What is it?
Thank you English language for being easily confusing.
This is god tier comedy. It must win an emmy
Uh oh, don't look up the Beat It site, kids!
HAVE SOME MORE CHICKEN HAVE SOME MORE PIE
I think Weiner would have been funnier.
The thumbnail really doesn’t help that he looks like he’s having the worlds loudest…..
i love how in almost every mike and zach video, the awesome duo nearly always have different character designs! this one is for you piemations, nothing beats that idea.
This i weirded than a printer going rouge
E621 lmao
Just beat it
It's too early for this 😂
We all have that one friend.
The choice of Mike's beating material is... Interesting
Once I saw the e621 site I cracked! I was on the floor laughing so hard!
No Mammoth Mountain oysters? Damn
I swear, the outtakes are the best part of this.
I love gags like this.
I loved this
Truly wonderful. Abbot and Costello would be proud.
OwO, notices your e621 👀
Someone please clip the last bit incase this gets taken down for it so we have it to keep for later days that need seritonin
I knew where this was going and I was surprised anyway
Did I just see e621
this is one of the videos of piemation
one second they're talking about the song beat it the next second beating it as in getting out, the next second about beating it adn the next one about beating it
I was just watching that music video a few minutes ago before I even noticed this was posted lol.
Funny! I love you guys. Absolute innocent pleasure.
i haven’t laughed at an outtakes like this ever holy shit
I love the extra takes
Yesss
but like what about the game of tag
I just got beat
MICHAEL JACKSON Is EPICSOME!!!👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😎
question that spyro is it suppose to be a reference to skylanders spyros adventures by the pose and the thing its standing is what i can assume is the base
E621 eh?
Zack you killed him.
In the start, I was like, "Man, this definitely has an innuendo behind it" Then it just progressively starts escalating.
Wait does this mean he's an furry?
MY MMMEAT!
That's a good site
0:44 Ok dude
That was extremely funny
I like the Spyro in the back
The only downside was that they didn’t use the voice of Suction Cup Man
I want to beat it
HAHAHAH WOW HE’S GOING ON TO E621!!! WOW!!!!!! HE REALLY WILL BEAT THAT WEBSITE TO DUST.
loved that when his computer turned on it was already on e621
Fifth seconds in the video I’m weak
Piemations is the Numero Uno, he just comes back unexpectedly, he's a legend
That ending was fucking amazing
Those takes at the end are just stupid and I love it so much.  Excessive Cock screaming
*I DON'T* *_FUCKIN'_* *YEE-HAW!!* those takes were like getting a second slice of cake after that of the actual animation, deeee-licious~
Turning the ending into a ringtone
i love hilarious misconceptions especially this one
😂😂😂
Unbeatable
Haven't laughed in so long
LMAO THAT E621 PAGE
Fucking Esix of all websites....
best animation you made
e621 I know what it is
Amazing.
GODDAMN IT JUST FUCKING BEAT IT !!!!
Zach's realization tho🤣🤣🤣
Thats not Beat It that's Scuffed It.
I love the punchline at the end btw
e621 XD
I had a terrible day at work today. But this totally made up for it.  I smiled and laughed and just loved it. Thank you for all you do Keep it up!!!!
If I had a nickel for every pair named Mike and Zack on YouTube that I watch, I'd have two nickels.
Made the mistake of looking up the website...
He got beated
"My Weiner" should have been the final take, omg-
what meat
0:44 oh no
I love your channel keep up the great stuff!!
French citizens in the 1700's disputing for the last speck of beef during a terrible famine 2:05
It doesn’t matter who’s wrong or right.   … does it?
hmm. soo Mike is a furry? i dont know any other reason to him to have e621 open xD
they do what??
misleading thumbnail
Meat Beat Mania!
Are you winning Piemations?
The best video
Incredible as always😂
Nah bro he got the e621 open my man finna BEAT IT beat it.
I had to instantly pause upon seeing e6 pop up. Laughed too hard to continue
Welll
OK I really liked the tag joke
How did I of all people not even pick up on the innuendo? For some reason my 1st thought actually was Michael Jackson.
Mike beats it to e621 down bad
I love these short videos just about one joke so much X)
Someone is going to edit an alternate version of this using those outtakes
good ol' monosodium glutamate
I was dying when E621 got opened
They can't beat it
Mike n zack
The credits are longer than the video.
Sheriff Hayseed easter egg. Dope!
this is so funny piemations nothing can beat it
Beat it IS a good song though.
E621 I see
i fucking love that half the video is just different takes for 'MY MEAT'  this is the content i come here for
Bro I can't last half of the first is just Mike screaming "MY MEAT"!!!!! XD XD XD XD
B E A T
Nothing Beats those outtakes
have they been in the army
Do you had Neigbours?
e621 was there for like 5 frames and yet
this videos is like the best video you have made, it definitely beat it in terms of quality.
I had a good laugh, thanks Mike! <3
Beat what?
MY "HOT DOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "🌭
Mike having e621 up and ready is kinda sus.
He beat it
This was very confusing
That thumbnails a bit sussy
i love how he also goes on e621 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Unbeatable
Three types of beat it BEAT IT beat it sus way beat it 🎶
The motherfucking e621 on the screen got me hard
It must be really interesting being Mike and Zach’s neighbor.
Best game of tag ever seen
I love the fuckin e6 cameo.
i love that i know exactly what website mike is on
nah no way Mike was on e6
Okay now the intro was kind of funny I left my ass off
This is totally one of thsoe ideas that you come up with at 3 in the morning when you've been talking shit with your friends for like 6 hours.
MEATMATIONS YEAH
I love the e621 reference! I love that site! 😉
LOOOORD  E621 popped up and I lost it
Zach's voice kinda reminds me of that Progressive Box. 📦
MY WIENER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I see the sequel to Skim Milk just came out
I would have known exactly what u mean when u brought the  lotion out
Hahah, E621 is the site he's gonna use.
Ah! The legendary e621! I remember discovering that shit in my teen years. So much childhood ruined! Ha!
Roomates
E621. Nice
This is pretty funny
Art
Remember the last Mike and Zach video? This one beat it.
I watched this with headphones, I don't regret it.
We want more Elements of Cringe!
i loved that miracle johnson song
Lol
Mike: "MY COCK!!" Zach "Wait you have a pet chicken?"
This is an absolute master piece
Why is there no sound...?
Bruh
Why are the best comedy duos always named Zach and Mike
Best ending of a video I've ever had the pleasure of listening to! <3
Funny
nah wtf why is there e621
e621? What a lewd raccoon
Mastrobation
I love how piemation is the reason im a artist and he is making videos like this XD
1:13
lol
Finally new one
the first thing i did was check if it got copyrighted- because of the start of the vid. Even though we all know its very clearly a parody. what has the world come to
This was every kind of beat I could’ve wanted
How is zach so innocent all of the sudden
🗿
Oh man this is great 🤣
0:42 Spyro!
Absolute Gamer Moment...  Wait why did e6- ummm... never mind
What did I just watch?
The voice crack bloopers are the best part 👌
New rules for Tag
Wow I really needed this laugh xD
chef: Here, have a meat tenderizer. We have a lot of schnitzels to make.
Just beat it dude, I wont tell anyone
Abott and Castello would like a word good sir.      You can find them at your local ball park.
The use of "beat it" in this is amazing. It's used in like every possible way in just over a minute. And the final "Tag, you're it" is perfect.
Why did I instantly recognize e621 on the monitor...
Beat it
I laughed so hard my heart stopped help
Ah yes. The new "Piemations yeah!" outro is gonna be top tier. "My cock and balls!" followed by a pie to the face.
ahahaha)
oh my god this is too good to be true kekw
Bro had e621 ready
Guy just wants time alone to himself and apparently his friend is way dense.
The punch made me jump back, it was truly unexpected.
Oh my god 🤣🤣
Beat it
They used the 2:08 one
М
lemon grab out here
MIME EAT MIKE OCK
my *MEAT*
Still love the vids love the suction cup man series
mike and zach besto series in youtube
Same energy as skim milk
Warning: Everyone was beaten in the making of this video
That your it line was fire
Wait, I'm confused, whos on first?
BREAKING NEWS: man yells "MY MEAT" so loud he loses his voice man is being sentenced to life in prison due to scarring every child within a 50 mile radius.
Wow what a fun and interesting looking videogame on the computer
E621, Nice XD
Someone should send this to Zach and Mike, the BurnHazard guys.
i started thinking before even watching "its gonna be some dumbass joke 🥰😍" but still clicked it
clever.
Nothing beats more Mike and Zach.
This is the best thing I've ever watched
Yes Zach. It’s a game. Think nothing more of that screen, for your sake
You know Mike's a Furry when he uses e621 instead of R34.
EAT IT!!!
A Spyro figurine, I can only think of one thing with that…
Imagine your neighbors listening to this
That was a rollercoster
Rip piemations you and your animations WERE good once.
Epico
Can't wait to see how fast this gets copyright striked for MJ. Love the vid.
I lost it at the e621 on the screen xD
Nothing beats this video
Just Beat It
This is hilarious
Everydays a good day when piemations posts
Alt reality where Zach hazard and mike burnfire never went into the military
You back
He beat it.
Gee willickers, best vid ever.
M Y    M E A T
I absolutely love this
woah a post on my birthday, what a nice time
Those Sheriff Hayseed and Shawn plushies on the shelf are beated me.
With how much time was left I assumed when he yelled my meat the guy was gonna think he was cooking
XD
This video is a good material for my english classes
0:44 bro fr pulled up e621 (iykyk)
So… Mike is a furry? Woah.
So are we all gonna ignore e621 on his computer cause I died laughing when I noticed
1:49 why does it sound like Stan from gravity falls
this is just whos on first but modern
He could just say "spank the monkey". "A date with Rosie Palms". Or straight up "fapping".
Nice E6 refrencing
For those playing at home, the word beat was used exactly 30 times in this video (not including outtakes)
Awesome  Also I animate toast
I love Michael Jackson, i sure hope his songs are being used in a good way!      Btw love the artstyle, looks very unique and fun, and the animations are awesome as always :)
Stop the slang and talk normal guys.
Who is Mike hawk?
Michael Jackson would be proud...and disappointed at the same time
I can’t wait for “my wiener!” to be used in some dramatic shitpost
Wheezing Intensifies
Oh my god seeing e6 absolutely destroyed me
i beat up a child with a hammer, he didn't stand a chance
mikeburnfire goin wild behind the scenes
That was a fucking rollar coaster
I paused the ad so i could comment, this better have to do with beat it by michael jackson or im going to get angry
💀
e621 lmao
I lost it when e621 popped up on the desktop
I got a notifcation for this but it said i wasn't subscribed....WTF
Oh my lord.
Bro its too hard, But I really want to beat it
I'm waiting for the skim milk to come back
Who's on stage?
Oh my God i love this so much xD I'm dying as hell!    IM GOING TO BEAT IT! BEAT WHAT!? MY POONANI! PFFFT!!! XD
this is super funny as well as the bloopers
Holy fucking shit. I lost it when e621 came up.  Fucking amazing. lmao
I'm glad it was both what i hoped and feared
You can never go wrong with Mike and Zach, it's so hard to beat it
Zach would have totally understood what Mike was going to beat if he had pulled out a bottle of skim milk instead.
The outtakes remind me of the „YEAH TOAST!“ song
Great video, now can you please beat it?
I said beat beat im a sheep
If you can’t beat them join them
yo,! YO! YOOO! MIKE STAY OFF THAT WEBSITE
THANK YOU FOR KEEPING IN THE EXTRA TAKES
That was hard to watch
There's gonna be rule 34 of this someday, I'll make it if necessary
such a confusing conversation
I fuckin love this shit, listening to them DICK around is hilarious
ima be real i thought it was micheal jackson in the first place and didnt get the joke till i looked at the description -_-
0:44: *exists*  Me, a furry: *DiCaprio pointing*
that webpage spashscreen though... i mean im good with it i belong in those kinds of places but still if that was a nod to a thing great job!
I’M THE BEAT THE FUCK OUT OF THAT LIKE BUTTON!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the intensity of "MY MEAT" and the effort they input into that single line was immaculate ✨
Sus video
E621 if you know you know
Ok. MAYBE a little change some people came for the thumbnail. (no its not corn)
This is on par with the soup store joke
MY MEAT!!!
the e621 got me
Bro im bagging up🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is a silly little gag that I wasn't really understanding untill those bloopers
Zach has some anger problems
this is so funny 🤣  they say beat it too many time 🤣
Sees e621
What? Y'all have never helped your friends best it before?
Have some more chicken, have some more pie
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I just knew this had something to do with Michael Jackson.  Beat It was the first song from him that I listened to.  Also, I laughed when I heard variations of "MY MEAT!"
Yes this is the most gay thing ever, and I love it. Also that computer says E631… I wonder what he’ll search… meh probably something with plungers and furries…
just let him beat it
I swear, every Piemations video cracks me up
I knew what he meant by beat it when monosodium glutamate appeared on screen.
I checked ur channel this morning for some reason and next thing I know u upload a new video today. What are the odds.
beat it
I wonder how many people recognise the website Mike pulled up
Welli just beat it
There is nothing better, than hearing a guy screaming variations on "my meat" on top of his lungs for a whole minute
When I saw this I just auto thought of Mike burnfire and Zach hazard. My current favorite YouTubers.
Skim Milk
I saw that e621 in the background
Ah yes the 'ol e.621
I got no notif but my other account did
Mike's computer automatically sends it to e621, wonderful
I love how it just becomes one of them screaming different ways to describe genitals
beat it
this is hilarious.
Never fails to make bangers
Hey pie is this based on a real story?
E621???!?!?!!
God tier shitpost status
I genuinely want to see this become the next Soup Store
After like two years The legend is back please make suction cup 5 pz
right on september
Mike is a furry confirmed
Oh God .. I know that site.. truly cursed
I thought about the song first then watched the video and realized what it was
"The only way to defeat the beat is with meat." -Steven Q. Universe
*I WILL HELP YOU BEAT IT*  *MY WIENER*  *MAYYY*  *MAYY PEANIS*  It was freaking hilarious. You can't deny it.
Why?
I FUCKING KNEW IT I CALLED IT
The thumbnail 💀
well this takes the expression "beat my meat" to a whole new level. 1:50 I lost it.
The e621 joke short-circuited my pattern recognition,  but now one of these three things have to be cannon:  -Mike has a button on the lower right of his keyboard is autohotkey-ed to open e621 -They just so happened to be listening to beat it on e621 -Mike has set e621's home screen as his computer lock screen as some sort of deterrent
His fetish is showing people his favorite song  Or Micheal Jackson ...  Or both
e621? Classy.
Wonderful!
He did beat it
Epic
This video had me *beat, it* is just too good.
WOAH MIKE LIKES E621
Ha, funny number website.
This new Piemations video is hilarious it's unbeatable.
Piemations? More like MyMeat
E621 nice 👍
If I had a nickel for everytime they say beat it lol
Lol I lost it
beat it has lost all meaning
E621 A man of quality
I saw the blue on the PC and KNEW IT
Why are your puns so good?
0:44 Mike really pulled up e621 on Zach🤣🤣🤣
BEAT WHAT MY MEAT
Only furries know what site that is
This proves I haven't matured one bit
I think he beat it.
0:37 Piemations would've did that purpose but he forgot that they cant do that because youtube will demonitize it lol
Top 10 reasons why women live longer than men
If my counting was correct, the word “beat” and its alterations (e.g. beating) was said 30 times throughout the video, excluding the outtakes.
just beat it.
BEAT IT!
Did... Did he opened e621?
i love the subtle hints in there lol
Just beat it already
Yo, e621 making a cameo, neat
E621 is fucking hilarious…should’ve been pulled up to that Sheriff show you’re making.
I think they are beating it
Pretty fresh video
THE SOUP STORE
Jokes aside Beat It is actually a good song and i recommend y'all to listen to it
English is a language that exists
Mike & Zach
Oh my god this took a turn I didn’t expect
I can't help but feel like the "tag your it" joke was the first joke they wrote and the rest of the video was just a way to implement it
Eat it, have some more chicken
I know that logo
1:52  you can hear some other people laughing
Beat it
0:44 So, is this saying you're a furry?
Im watching this at work thank you
LMFAO This was perfection!
_MY MEAT_
Beat it
I'm just wandering if these Mike and Zach are the same as mikeburnfire stories?
The boys beat it
I love how the bloopers are half the length of the vid 😂
Making beats by beating beets with a beater while wearing beats
this beats alot of other animations
Mike's neighbors must be horribly scarred
Sheriff Hayseed plushie looks cute af
Is...is that spyro?
0:44 oh... i recognise that website💀
Abbott and Costello walked so that Piemations could run
I have no word for this. I'm dying XDDDDDDDDD
The video was already so good, but these outtakes really putting it in god tier.
I hate that I can recognize e621 at a glance.  I'm such a degenerate furry.
XD
Well, this is going on r/furry_irl within the next 24 hours.
so was the video the animated mlp version. thats the true question
HES A FURRY
I don’t know if I’ve ever heard the scenario, I’m gonna beat *it* , _tag_
They  are baaaack
*BEAT IT*
Not the e6 on the computer
O:44 Mike is a furry. Zach is innocent.
It just keeps going, huh?
this is one of those rare videos that made me laugh for a good 5 min, and i love it
Mike and Zach need to meet Suction Cup Man.
WHAAAAAAT IS HAPPENING
Hehehehe, funny.
You gotta respect his honesty!
I like the little Spyro figure in the background~
What are we beatin'?
okay now beat it
they what
Have some more chicken
*sudden realization*
fruit punch went out of my nose that is how hard i laughed
I’m still confused
This will be remembered as the day, when piemations uploads.
Beat it! Beat it! Don't you make me repeat it!
Third base!
This ain’t the porn site I’ve been promised too by a QR code
This was beautiful  It was glorious  It was  m a g n i f i c e n t.
I know it wouldn’t be possible, but just imagine someone walking by and hearing two grown men shouting ‘My meat!’ and other euphemisms at the top of their lungs.
Bruh you should have put "MY WIENER" at the end bro 🤣
is anyone gonna comment about how Zach pulled up E621 infront of Mike
Beat the Beat
Mike. Why that site? Why?
Beat him
You know who else beat it? MY MEAT
Beat the--- 💀
So this is a sequel to skim milk?
They sure are beating it
🤨
your neighbors must be incredibly concerned
I just got the ending lmao, that’s an amazing joke that can’t be beat
So... they are going to hunt down and assault IT?   ... Are we talking Pennywise or someone in the IT department?
oh my gahd
0:45 if you know you know.
dang is this content?
The e621 made me spit out my drink
"MY WEENUR >:[" 1:32
Bro this is a whole new level of humor
the bloopers really got me lmao
Pog
LMAO
10/10 ending
this is how it feels to have a conversation with autism
can we take a seconed to apritiate that they left over half the video's time in cuts still in and its just mmMMMMMY-...
I- that’s kinda weird man. I mean I shouldn’t be mentioning this but E6.. you know the screen.
This would have been easy saying just Beat the salami
The ultimate friendship
it is now canon that mike uses e621 and is cultured
The words were family friendly, but the suggestion was not
Some say, to this day.... They're still Beating It.
I don’t care how often you upload, as long as you’re having fun with it, I don’t mind 😊
I'm dissapointed please upload this on yellow and black website
Cant we all just, Beat him alone?
Who's on 1st?
Beautiful
👍👍👍👍👍
Nothing beats a good ol piemation video
0:54 had me on the floor 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dumba**
BRUHHHHH...
Hell yea!
e621 advertisement
I guess we found the furry. Not bad.
Bring back suction cup man
E621
Well. Head the other way dude!
This is a real “neutral face with one eyebrow raised and the other one normal” moment
The e621 reference lol
that msg referance though . . .
This was beautiful
This is the greatest video of all time
The funny bit starts at 1:14 🤣
not e621 😭😭😭😭
Not the e621 search page 😭
Best it
The only good thing on e621 are the humorous tags like "lol_comments" or "what_has_science_done"
Not the e621 hahahahahaha
Love your vids dude I have been a while I still enjoy 🥔
What kind of soundproofing do these people have.
The 15 minute unskipable ad made it seem like this video was a warning.
0:44 🤨 I’ve seen that website before
I appreciate the little e621 there...
AYO I SAW THAT e621 TAB
New vid yay
I love their relationship so much, the best of friends
I appreciate that half the video was you talking about beating your "meat"
What is e621?
Lol
Beating each other off 🤨
...but who's on first?
As a teen mike telling Zach to get out of his room when he’s gonna “beat it” is relatable in many ways
IM AT BEAT!!! What do you mean your at beat?! I MEAN IM AT BEAT!!
Yknow I'd love to be their neighbor: Just relaxin on a Saturday, drinking som cof-  Just next door: *MY MEAT!*
hehehehehehheheheheheehehehhehhehhhehehehhehehe
what the...
This reminds me of skim milk alot
e621. Good choice.
BEET.
Lmao the e621
Just seeing the tittle made my mind race with possible puns and the actual song. Oh my delight to see it all come true.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
he pulled up e6 noooooooo
I wonder what their naighbors are thinking
The website
Hee Hee
This is pure comidic genius
The e621 ref lmao
This is the type of piemations i grew up with
YO THIS IS FUNNY AS HELL
i'd say something original but i guess everyone's beaten me to it
Ayo???  Edit: Oh 💀
Skin milk stick your
Only Mike and Zach would yell at each other to beat it.
His animation are some of the funniest in the world
when you recognise the website on mikes pc
0:43 activated my fight or flight response
Yah know, when I first read title....this is what I expected. What I didn't expect was the classic song Beat It.
0:45 ayo the thing on the monitor do be kinda sus
He had me at the thumbnail, i’m not gonna lie
0:45 piemations, is there something you want to share with the class?
ıs ıt bad that ı ınstantly recognızed e621 and ɟust dıed when he saıd "ıs that a game?"
I'm not sure what was funnier, the actual video or the bloopers XD
FUCKING E6 😂
The voice actors must love their job. Being able to scream about beating meat into a microphone for money sounds like a dream job
mikeburnfire?
the second I saw e6 I let out a scream so loud it caused everybody in a 7 mile radius to go deaf
Ayo?
the outtakes got me in tears
I love y'all's animations but those outtakes were priceless
The versatility of the words beat it
How do you make burgers with tissues and lotion
The polar opposites of Mike Burnfire and Zachary Hazrd.
Wank my Wookie
Yooo I love e621 that's my favourite game!!!
Wtf-
he... acualy uploaded
I loved this video so much
E621!!!!!!!!! WTF
Lmao e621. I wouldn't have confessed that, someone would've had to Beat It out of me.
That... was e621 wasn't it...          A man of quality i see
This video was great now beat it
Oh..... I thought it was Mike and Zach from youtube
bruh I thought this was mikeburnfire
This is a good demonstration of American colloquialism
Heh E621. Nice
Reminds me of Edds world. I love the animation in this!
0:44 *Cough cough*
MY MMMEAT reminded me of the lemon grab scream Justin Roland does in Adventure Time
How he didnt get it after he pulled out the lotion and tissues only Zach will know
Ya shoulda used the weiner take lmaoo
I have never laughed so hard at a bus stop in my life. Even with these after credits 🤣🤣🤣 great work guys thanks for making my day.
I love that sheriff hayseed easter egg!!
rule34 artists have fun
My brain went from: yes i get this To - WTF IS GOING ON *and i LOVE*
i do some what wish that he yelled "MY DICK" it would have been fucking insane
"I'M GOING TO BEAT IT!" "BEAT. WHAT." " MY MEAT!"
This is beautiful
Dear lord E621 got me lmao
Stepping on beat Dadoodoodoo
i luv the blooper XD
Exceptional
Beat it the meat it
The e621 reference killed me
This. This is peak comedy
It want to 0 to 100 really fast
This has to be one of the funniest videos you beat out of the pipeline.
i love that it shows e621 a furry porn site
Piemations never disappoints!  👍👍
Private First Class Zach.
That thumbnail though
I'd love to be your guy's neighbor lmao. This shit is hilarious it's like noon and all you hear is "IM GONNA BEAT MY MEEAATT!"
a truly poetic video about the many definitions of the phrase "beat it"
It's 10am on a Saturday, and I'm listening to two people screaming "MY MEAT'... Eh, not the weirdest start to a day.
lol
best work yet :D
rip your neighbours
I couldn't have possibly predicted where this was going to go and I'm all for it
Moment I realized he was on e621😭😭
Deeeeeemonetized
The site gave me a jumpscare.
I- is that e6- you know your audience well
I Friking love Mike & Zach. It's just so good!
MY WEINER
im so glad there still uploeding there videos are so funny😊😊😊
Zach is on e621 specifically?
Loved it ❤️
Mike honestly sounds a lot like me, lol.
👍
That title and thumbnail is pretty sus 🤨📸
Interesting website you're browsing there
Spicy
The sacred numbered website
i liked the part where they said “its beating time” and beated everywhere
I got an add for toilet paper before the video.
Beautiful
Those outakes are pure comedy gold. I hope we get more outake footage.
salt
So stupid. I love it.
This video will not be beaten
e621. nice
Haha, I guess you can say this is the climax of the series so far!                                           *Get it?*
OwO?
1:53 Who's Mike Hawk and why are we beating him?!?!
❤️
*Pulls up e621* Always knew mike was a furry
Daww, the little plushies of Todd and Shawn on the shelf are so cute!
I like how this sounds wrong with or without context.
This. This is a comedic masterpiece.
Man I want those funny cowboy plushies you have on your shelf Mike.
Oooohhhhhh hahahahahaha  If you know you know
ah yes recording sessions for cartoons are fun.
This already got me laughing when I saw where he just pulled out the lotion
LoL 😂 yes oh
this is the best thing I've seen all day
abbot and gastello are rolling in their graves rn.
LETS GO E621 BEST WEBSITE!!!!!1
Definitely beat skim milk
This somehow managed to mix both  "You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?"  And  "Understandable have a great day."
and thus that quick glance of the screen when Mike hit the keyboard, tells us as much about ourselves as it does Mike.
As a foreighner, i gotta say this could be listed as an educational video.
good video!
It's the Skim Milk Incident all over again
Beat it with the homie ☕
"Skim milk, stick a dick in it!"
This made me laugh uncontrobly
Micheal Jackson be like
THIS IS PEAK COMEDY.
"MY STATISTICALLY AVERAGE BABY-MAKER!"
*MY SHMEEEEEAT!*
Lmfao e621. Tiss beat place for thy meat beating
ah... what a beautiful websute
Sonic_(series) Amy_rose webm
Wow.
I watched this sober  and got drunk
Gonk!
Nice thumbnail
BRUH E621 OH MY LORRRRD 😂
e621  That's  Mmm  Okay
Bro...
Every expression for "beat it" ever used
Look at those really cool and marketable plushies in the backround.
oh my god mike has the hl1 gordon freeman look
Monosodium glutamate
This is too funny
Oh god Zachs a furry
I Knew exactly were this was going, the my meat part killed me
Not gonna lie, that’s great
WHAT!?!?!?!?!?!????????????????????????????????
He’s gonna fuck the skim milk
...
Furrys Awoo ;3
So he's a furry
1 minute animation 1 minute outro and patreon  take me back to 2007 please
I can’t 😂
I love how half of this video is just them shouting various synonyms for dick.
This was amazing XD
Early Gang
God I hope Mike and Zack have neighbors that heard them recording all this
Im so stoked whenever I see a new animation from you bro, regardless of what it is, your sense of humor is like tailor made for animation :). Also, its a little silly the credits are essientally as long as the cartoon, but thats independent animation I guess! Hope you're doing well Mike!
sheriff hayseed reference in the shelf
i was expecting something a little more risque but i guess that works too          nevermind that turned sour quickly
Ah yes my favorite Jake & Josh episode is on
Good job
lol just yesterday i rewatched the suction cup man videos and its fitting a new piemations video came out today 🤣
Listening the the two of your record your lines is somehow infinitely more entertaining to me than the actual animation.
Lool that last part also  MYYYY dingaLIIINNGGG
Ambatukam UUUUWWWOOOGGGHHH
Man those takes were funny and also showed that you guys did a great hard and great work on thr animation itself and voicing the characters lol
My Wife
heh
Oh my god, esix
Man I’m Beat…
the outtakes are just as funny as the animated part.
Афигенно
Deadass I watched this in my car with the radio tuned to my local 80s channel and the moment the video ended they started playing Beat It.
e621 nice
Tastefully beautiful, another banger.
holy shit hes into a kind of protogen porn noice my guy. im into that aswell
this is a beautiful masterpiece
Hehehe
MY. MEAT.
.....I think I almost passed out when e621 popped up.....
It beats me how almost no one mentions the e6 page, lol.
*_MY SAUSAGE!!_*
bro what
He watches e621 eh??? 🤔🤔
I love that there are stuffed plushies of Sheriff Todd and Shawn on the shelf
Sure someone’s gonna beat it but who’s on first?
Some say Mike and Zach never did beat it
i am currently wearing a headset with a blue buri on top while watching this
MMMMM
Mike should really go to the kitchen for that. The bedroom really isn't a safe place for food preparation.
Which mike and zach though (mikeburnfire)
Zach certainly beat it
1st
Now... I... uh... how do you even think of this?
Normalise beating it with the homies
Ok, I've finally recovered from this godsend of comedy. You are a genius 🤣
Every definition of beat it. Lol
I didn't know MikeBurnFire was a patreon supporter
mabe one day i will see Mike & Zach  Piematins versus Mike & Zach mikeburnfire
Ok.
I'm glad you guys are having fun while you work. This is some great stuff.
This is hilarious! 🤣 Well done
The delivery of "Tag, you're IT" sent me flying. What a perfect way to end off the skit.
0:44 Mike is sus.
The E621 on the pc im gone
At least something got beaten.
Another good animation, as always.
When I heard Beat it I thought it was talking the song
This was way too funny, nothing is even close to "beating it"
very dubious
1:53
DEAR GOD NOT THE E621
When i saw on 0:44 I was like "TF Dude"
Pimations is such a jem
FUCK YEAH
I still can’t believe that beat it has many different meanings.
This is the only thing I really wait for in Yt. This was by far my favorite one. Guys, you totally beat it. Greetings from Colombia. <3 <3 <3
interesting choice of material website
I think they were hit by a memetic agent, CAN WE GET A TASK FORCE TO QUARANTINE THEM?!   And I just coincidentally realized that my character model I made has the same shirt at zack
Those takes were "longer" and went harder than I thought it would
Never heard the phrase "beat it" so many times outside of a high school boys bathroom stall
Can't get halfway through without wanting to end it all, i will stop now and finish this later.
No. Mike just wanted to make a spaghetti with meatballs
This is amazing in a month
Beat this
The dumbest but funniest video of how we use beat it to mean different things.
mike aint even signed into e621
Knew it was gonna be about the song for a while.
🤔 Ayoo
MY MEAT
yes
AYO??!?!
I've never wheezed so hard before 💀
There's skim milk goes.
Man needs some skim milk
I love the sheer expressiveness of the characters in this!
I don’t know why but I swear I can hear Benson
My MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEAT
Can we just take the time to appreciate the audio at the ending
🤨
piemations
UM..... EXCUSE ME PIEMATIONS....GREAT VIDEO BUT.....I FKN MISS SUCTION CUP MAN!!!!! Where has he gone?
The Animation is so South Park like, even the humor! Great video.
*M Y  M E A T*
"MY MEAT!" Is my new notification sound.
that thumbnail tho
Watching two guys beat it is the best!
This was the greatest and most appropriate animation I’ve watched in years 👌
E621 on the computer screen had me  fucking dieing
Piemations, ¡YEEEEEEAH!!
im dead
Lmao
Lmao
lmao
This reminds of the skin milk video
I spat out my drink when e621 flashed on his computer screen oh my god
I appreciate half of the video being exclusively about Mike shouting different variations of "MY DICK". I'm sure none of those sound clips will be cut out and repurposed for anything.
beat what
OwO notices your 621
There is never a dull moment between you two 😂
Lol this is so absurdly funny...
I was just in the middle of watching the 10th Anniversary Stream but I’ll take a break from that for now and watch this new work of our Pie Family Man, also I am suggesting a Rick May Tribute (Beloved Voice Actor Among The Many Communities) Just a suggestion though
*E621 on the screen*
The description is so golden
MY MEAT 😡
lol
I thought this was a Mikeburnfire crossover for a second
me n my homies always beat it together
The outtakes made me laugh so hard, it's a hilarious video, "beat it" man, it's good XD
That ending was acceptable
Is that E621?
Where’s five nights at freddys
This video changed my life
This is great
I instantly knew where this was going to be heading.
This is to funny i needed this!! Thank u
Can we all notice the fact he opened up e621.
This guy made TF2 Animations! Now he don't I like thier Animations with TF2 That's nostalgic!
Two men beating it together, with the power of friendship
i love the idea of mike screaming "my schmeat"
I’m gunna beat it.
BRUH NOT THE E621💀
So glad you included those extra takes, they had me dying 🤣
In today's episode of Mike & Zach, Mike shows Zach his favourite song, called Beat It. Afterwards, Mike expresses his desire to masturbate, so requests informally that Zach vacate his bedroom in order to be alone to pleasure himself, by saying "Beat It" Zach is confused by this, and requests Mike clarify the meaning of his very poor choice of words, believing Mike to be talking about passing a difficult level of a video game. After a heated debate, Mike finally confesses in no uncertain terms that he wishes to play with himself, and Zach awkwardly announces his departure by saying "Beat It" Once more, confusion arises as Mike believes Zach is going to masturbate in front of him. Having had enough at this point, Zach finally beats Mike off.
*J u s t b e a t i t*
i love videos that make me question how words sound and how weird they sound
Pennywise: *sweating profusely*
This was the perfect short
MY MEAT!
omfg the outtakes have me CRYING
Most viewers: Great video!  Furries: *Sees website on computer. Inhale.* So uh, Mike.
Have some more chicken, have some more pie, it doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried
I swear, I cannot stop tearing up from laughter because of this lmao
This is what why parents see when they walk in when you're watching YouTube videos
Lesson: If your friend tells you to beat it, get lost, but if they say they're gonna 'beat it', still gtfo, unless you want to help them beat it...      That frustrating level in a video game. Now you know :)
Collage:
Interesting website choice.
Sus thumbnail
HOLY SHIT. IT IS A MICHAEL JACKSON REFERENCE.  e621!? FUCKING FURRIES!!
the outtakes are glorious lol
You will make more   FNAF  animations ?
who's on first anyway?
YES
I had ptsd flashbacks as soon as that computer screen came on.
Alright I’m gonna beat it
It's a good thing Mich and Zach finally found relief
e621
i was drinking milk while watching and then i laughed and it got everywhere now it looks like *I* beat it 😔😔
e621 the video game 💀
Me before video:   "I wonder what context he means..."  Me after video:  "Ah, all of them then."
Its been a month, he back
The fact like half of the video is out takes of trying to not laugh is perfect
Sir you need to put down the pen
MY SIZABLE SPHEROIDS AND SHAFT
Plot twist: Mike wants to tenderize his steak
Umm ok
Oop
Mike has E6 on speed dial
There is the same energy as "Fuck the Skim Milk" but grander somehow XD
funny as always, amazing work xD
Mike Loading up E621 confirms it that he is a furry, lol
nice
oh MY GOD THEYRE MAS-
Ah the power of the English Language  Now I’m gonna beat it
I knew it going to be something about m*st*rb*ti*n
E621 be like
this is amazing.
Beat it, right now
👍👍👍👍👍👍
I love Zack’s face of realization Wen he discovers what Mike was referring to
He's going to beat the three eyed serpent!!!
WHY DID E621 COME UP HELP 💀💀
This genuinely made me laugh. God I love this channel <3
"Just eat it eat it eat it eat it eat it"   -Feet guy
It starts getting sus when Mike opens e621
gay
This was harmless for 50 seconds
this got violent lol
I just realized that the Mike and Zach most people are familiar with are actually Patreon supporters.  This makes this series so much funnier and I don't know why.
Oh yeah beat that shit up 🤨
I would be surprised that Mike set his computer to e621, but then again, it's _Mike_
"MY MEAT!" line is getting funnier every time I hear it after the bloopers.
I love just, how close things are to "Mike being a furry is the norm" that we're getting to. Feels nice- miss Pretzel
it was less the skit but more hearing mike scream iterations of "my dick" for 40 seconds
This was hilarious
When he said "M Y   M E A T", I went fucking insane. THE FUCKIGN END CREDITS MADE ME CRY11!11!!!!!
Why did I think he did an animation on Mike burnfire and Zach Hazard?
Lmao
This was the wildest minute of conversation I think I've had the pleasure of watching.
That escalated quickly
wait i was right
Masterpiece
I love the detail of the monitor turning on half at a time thats so neat
what did his meat do it doesn't deserve it
Ayo what’s the website 🤨🤨🤨🤨📸📸📸📸
MY MEEAT
0:34 comedy gold 😂
MYyYy meAT
my face hurts more from laughing than when i got my wisdom teeth removed! XD
“MY MEAT!!”  HELP WHY DID I PICTURE AN ITALIAN CHEF DROPPING SALAMI- 😭🤌🏽
this is definitely up there as one of the dumbest videos on the channel
Just beating It with the boys
Interesting choice of website you've got there.
hello
omfg the cursed site... You have a lot of balls putting it on screen.
Beat it!
how do you just make this
hi
e621
Love the subtle e621 screen🤣🤣🤣
*THIS is when boys send mixed signals. It gets really confusing.*
The extra takes really make it 😂
Yknow I really wasn’t expecting e6 to pop up, but I fucking lost it
0:44 So Mike is a degenerate got it
MY MEAT!
You guys are really beating it with these new animations.
HOLY FUCK PIEMATION POSTED
I knew where this was going, but the joke just hit's diffrent and it's great.
I like the mike and zack series
lol
we're all mature here .     never change guys.
plot twist: they beat someone up
I could stop laughing at the lotion, slippy smooth. What even is that!?!🤣
The title makes me question life
Never before have I been so amused by hearing two giggly guys yelling variations of MY MEAT
**Notes website**
The unfortunate fact that one set of words has several meanings
……wait….
This is comedy gold
clicked for the thumbnail
0:45 oh hell nah
E
Zack yelling "MY FAT FUCKING COCK" is something I didn't know I needed to hear until now.
just beat it man
If you tag someone twice, you make yourself it again
This is hilarious, i love these animations
One-letter-three-numbers? Huzzah! A man of culture!
Beat it
If you recognize that yellow and blue website you are not going to heaven
0:45 oh wow its the funny site
Stay innocent Zach
Lowkey wanted to see him help him beat it, everyone needs a little beating sometimes
this just seems like a joke you came up with while beating it and I love it
Hahaha, this is the best version of the classic "who's on first" gag. Nothing else could _beat it_ 😏
i saw mike and zach and thought mikeburnfire and zach hazard
I guess Zach beat him to the punch.
"This is where the fuck begins." -Anakin Skywanker
Mike uses e621 lol, a true man of culture
WHY DID HE OPEN E621?!?!
Can confirm, e621 is the best game ever
💀
Beetroot
Here before it gets age restricted
0:45 🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
0:45 orange shirt guy whos name i cannot remember what exactly are you going to be observing in the near future with the assistance of technology, what has appeared onto your screen of technology edit: upon further examination i have concluded i am proud of and relate to orange shirt guy whos name i cannot remember
This is one of the beauties of the English language.
I love these animations haha never fail to make me laugh 😂
I’m confused
as soon as i saw the thumbnail I knew what was coming                  mike was
Was… was that… e621? *sigh* I always knew it would come to this.
This feels like a spiritual successor to Skim Milk and I love it.
Instant classic
I wonder how fun this script was to write. Wonderful animation as per usual!!
Their favorite vegetables must be Beats.
I was not expecting to see e621, but I love that that's the site you chose
Is this a try not to get age restricted challenge?? cause holy shit 🤣🤣🤣
Ayo
That made me feel better, thank ya!
PIEMATIONS YEAHHHHHH!
This is amazing
0:44 we're not gonna talk about the pc XD
I wanna beat it too (It means women)
YES NEW UPLOAD
LMFAO
Hmmmm…. 🤨
had to pause the video when i saw e6 appear on the screen..
i have no words, only BEAT IT
i’m going to beat it
wow I’m early
finaly a new vid
If this is what Mike and Zach do to Beat It, then I don't even want to know what they'll do when they Smash. Steve and Kazuya are an absolute nightmare right now!
The daily lives of these two has to be as chaotic as all hell.
Anyone notice the e621 website?
“BEAT WHAT?”  “ *MY MEAT!* ”
oh my god 0:45
The "tag your it" joke is very clever
e621 :husk:
Hey uhh… what was that website on the computer? Asking for a friend.
Short, funny, and epic. 11/10
1:12 Maps with headless horseless horseman be like:
The bloopers lmao
The amount of power put into various types of classification of "penis" is frightening, keep up the good content sir
Oh god e621 I can't breathe XD
I beat it every day
💀 so many definitions
0:44 hm
opening fuckin e6 for the video u meme xD
bruh what .
"beat, MY MEAT!!"
This was a good video and it will be hard to beat it
Can we all appreciate how great of a friend Zach is to offer to help beat it
damn, he really did get beat to it
Just beat it
NAH NOT THE E6 BEING OPENED
They shoulda played this song to the printer
Just saw in the Patreon list that MikeBurnFire supports PIEMATIONS, so Mike and Zach like Mike and Zack, huh neat
I too love Monosodium Glutamate
Oh nah not the website
Never clicked on a video so fast and my only regret is that there wasnt a longer audio clip of Mike and Zach yelling random stuff into the microphone. Good job guys!
Hah, e621~
Really on the edge of age restriction
He beat it turns on e621 😂😂
0:44 Ah, a man of culture.
boys will be boys
Lol
Ah yes we all enjoy a little bit of monosodium glutamate from time to time
beautiful.
After watching the video, the thumbnail explains a lot
oh god not the e621 joke that killed me
He's gonna beat it
Прикольно...,👉👌😂😂😂
I loved this
when he beats the desk the funny number website turns up that got me. mike just keeping it acurrate
that thumbnail tho
real shit
THE TAG PART CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD
It's beutiful
“Beat it” Mike said calmly
1:10 OOP
Funny as hell
Slayyy
Where is the meat? 🍖
"BEAT WHAT???" he asked politely "MY MEAT!!!!" he responded in a calm voice
Every bromance story ever told.
This was priceless.
I feel so dirty But it’s so worth it XD Also DO NOT look up the website shown on mike’s computer
I was trying to comment something with “Beat meat” in it but YouTube keeps automatically deleting the comment because it has “Beating meat” in it and now I can’t think of something else to comment.
Nothing BEATS the old "who's on first" routine
Yesss new vid
LMAO
Ahhh insanity
Is it weird I can see this being on Adult Swim?
MY MALE GENITALIA!
This is gonna be good lmao
I’M GOING TO BEAT IT!
I see Mike knows of the magic three numbered website
My DOng!
The tag bit was perfect
Ban
ah yes. 621. good choice
The "My Weiner" during credits killed me
Beat it doesn't even sound like a phrase anymore.
When will the NSFW version be released?
Mike was this sponsored by e621 by chance?
great to know
I'm going to beat the like button
They're always happy to watch man, love it. Or well...watch...you guys...I..I don't know...I...I should just beat it.
"BEAT WHAT!" "MY MEAT" I died 🤣🤣
I like that he’s about to browse e6 and has a Spyro figure at the same time
Wait Does This Actually Confirm That Mike Is A Furry Maybe IDK I Just Saw The Furry P Site And Freaked Out
Did you beat it?!
Damn💀😂📸
beat it  Love it this is funny I couldn't stop laughing every second
can't wait for a new Fries on the Side song
And they were roomates.
Amazing episode I ever seen so far
Now this song will have a different meaning for me...
11/10, would beat it
This is ridiculous, never stop
what are they beating, my good sir?
E621 as the opened tab  I’m done
There are too many meanings for that phrase in American culture.  Also, Mike screaming at the end is fantastic
Your neighbors have to be THE most understanding people.
Whenever Mike pulled out the bottle of lotion I immediately lost it
Nice videos they remind me of my childhood!
Aw hell naw Mike on e621, what he lookin up?
Mike was gonna beat it until he makes a Cream-Piemation
This right here. This is art
mikeal and zakch, yyaya
Babe wake up piemations new video!
On behalf of everyone, I would like to thank you for including those beautiful outtakes :)
What do you use to animate?
is this a protracted "who's on first" reference?
*That moment when you actually catch the release of a Piemations Animation*
Cool
The fact that Mike's computer is automatically on E621 is funny as shit.  Edit: To everyone listing their favorite artists in the replies: Diives is the best.
0:44 Mm yes, my favorite site
I CANT-
WAHT THE FUCJK DID ZACH SAY
Hm
It's been a year daddy
e621, thou art a man of culture!
this was incredible stupid and i loved every second
Zach and Mike screaming about wanting to ‘beat it’ is something I didn’t know I wanted to hear until now
i want suction cup man back please do so
E621 . . .  That’s all I’m gonna say.
I was expecting them to just start singing the song
Woah Piemations upload!
Clicked as soon as I seen the notification.  I don't regret it
My head hurts now, it feels like it was beaten.
This is funny
I prefer eat it, by weird al
They’re talking about drums right?
first
Mmmmmmmmmyyyyy winer
e621, good choice to beat it to.
Oh we already going to love it
Of course e6 is what pops up on the monitor.     And I appear to have outted myself
Thought it was gonna be Mikeburnfire and zachhazard
This was amazing!
Trying to explain to everybody about this
And Who’s on first!!!! 😆
Ok so now we need 10 hours of silence interrupted by you yelling MY MEAT
Nice video bro
This is the best thing I’ve witnessed
When you recognize what was on mikes computer
oh my fucking god those outtakes are KILLING me lmaooo
man, this is crazy.
MY M  E  A  T
the outtakes at the end 💀💀
What a great Piemations, breaking the system with 5 views and 651 likes!
MMMMYYYY MEAT
This is gold, it's like "Who's on first?" 🤣🤣🤣
The one day he uploads is my birthday, this is amazing
The shift from confusion to just P A N I C  is fucking incredible! Great job you guys!
Never have I clicked on a video quicker 😏
XD
It is not what I expected yet exactly what I expected
I'm beating it right now
Beat doesn’t even sound like a word anymore
Noted.
Is it bad I recognize the image on the computer
This is great. I didn’t know there could be some many different ways to beat it. ( The Spyro and Hayseed figurines were a nice touch)
Definitely one of the animations of all time
Grade A content right here 👍
When you yelled MY MEAT you sounded just like the fatso from harvester game
Wiener
Second check comment check. Love it, Boyos.
This is so stupid it’s a masterpiece
THE END 😂 I love the bloopers
Do another suction cup Man video
A Michael Jackson song turned into *safe chat off*
E621, a man of culture i see.
Oh my G O D, that absolutely killed me. Love the MJ reference, and the outtakes made me wheeze!!! Love your stuff, Piemations!!
HE JUST WANTS TO BEAT IT
In the parody ‘eat it’ my good pal said ‘have some more chicken, have some more pie, it doesn’t matter if it’s boiled or fried’
Why doesn't Zach wear blue anymore
I feel like if you mix the two of them together you’ll get a neckbeard
NO NOT E621!
WHAT IS EVEN HAPPENING
WTF 😂😂😂
Intersting website choice
Beater Mc beatingson
This is beyond epic
Beat it
I'm bi but no one will notice my comment
Meat
Well this is funny
SUS
mike is a furry
Amazing work as always Piemations!
The one day he uploads is my birthday, this is amazing
I love this
When Beat it has 5 diffrent terms.
lol
MIKE AND ZACH?!?!?
Well, one things for sure... I was not expecting that ending
BEATING MY MEAT
Classical Funni
All right, I'm beating it.
This just kept escalating 😂
This was the weirdest notification I’ve ever had
What type of abomination did I just watch?  10/10 Would beat it
Don’t worry he’s just trying to get some beets.
the context of this has uhhh confused me. Amazing work!
Sounds about right. My friends too like to beat each other about beating it
This is random, and that is normal for this channel
Comedy gold
nobody can, BEAT  ME.
I think they just have to beat it, but that could just me me
This is so blursed
The fact that i randomly thought this joke when i heard beat it some days ago makes this so much funnier
this is why god put us on this earth
A true roller coaster of emotions
this is so real
I love how E621 appeared on his screen when he slammed his keyboard. Not that I know about such a website, is it even a website? I don't know. I know nothing about it.
This reminds me of the skim milk bit
Omg that’s amazing. Nothing else could ever beat it.
I was not expecting E621 to be there lol
😭
I never realized their names are Zach and Mike.  Kinda like MikeBurnFire and Zach Hazard, best friends from Mike's channel. XD  It would be hilarious if you got them to voice these characters. :p
This is a representation of growing up with my brothers. I needed this today.
Beating dark souls 3b
These bloopers are beautiful
I LOVE THIS
“BEAT WHAT” “MY MEAT”

This video is absolutely incredible. Nothing could beat it.
Damn.
This video was so good that it brought Michael Jackson back from the dead.
