With retrospect, it was quite strange seeing Paqueta and Emerson in a different kit playing against us.
How Micky didn't put that chance away I have no idea haha
Lucy Ward 🤬🤬🤬
Lyon got what they deserved, cheating freaks, winking at the camera, he also stepped like 2 times before he went down after the tap
Who was the ref here? Absolutely horrendous, Cresswell shouldn’t have been sent off, he felt the **slightest** of contact and went to ground, couldn’t help but laugh at how he fell lmao
WEST HAM ARE MASSIVE
2nd leg Dembele ain't winking now 😉🤣⚒⚒⚒
Last man, don’t know if foul, but definitely a yellow
2:42 creswell red card
That poor excuse for a ref makes League 1 refs look good, never a red in a million years. Hope West Ham win the return leg.
Fair play to West ham thought they would get beat 2-0 or even 3-0
I want westham to go all the way to the final best of luck on thursday 2nd leg lyon arent no joke
Why is the screen so fizzy whenever theres movement? It made me think the match took place in America .
We got robbed. The ref was a disgrace. COYI. ⚒⚒⚒
Ndombele still a decent Midfielder!
10 men vs 12 and still got a draw
Ref should be banned forever, Bellingham saying this about Bayern vs Dortmund a few months ago he has match fixed before he’s done it again
I'm not a West Ham fan but that ref is a disgrace. Prob anti-English clubs.
These highlights paint a very different picture of Lyon. Nice one for cutting out the wink after dembele had cresswell sent off
I'm not convinced by Antonio. He usually shoots straight at the keeper. He lacks composure and a bit of technique for me.
Hope that Lyon supporting ref isn't in charge of the second leg,  he was diabolical,  and the red card is overturned,. Aaron Creswell shouldn't have been sent off. Roll on the second leg!!🤗🤗
Forgot to say a WHU fan invaded the pitch🤣🤣
Ndoombele should got a red not Aaaron cresswell Ndoombele dived
Ndombele is such a baller
The wink  said it all. The referee was conned.
I'm a big West Ham admirer under Moyes. It was a harsh red but on balance just about right. There was contact. It was minimal but both men were travelling at speed and that was enough. Their attacker was denied a decent shot .. ie a goal scoring opportunity. Can't comment about the rest of the refereeing as I didn't watch the game, just these highlights. I wish West Ham best wishes in the return leg.
Not even a West Ham fan but fair play to Antonio there every week chasing every ball
Ndombele destroyed the Spammers 😀
Fair play to West Ham getting a good result with 10 men for half the game👏🏾👏🏾
Can't help but recognise and respect west ham's season
I can see why it was a red, but it shouldn’t of been a red
Get used to sub standard refs  . As a chelsea supporter have seen unbelievable decisions by hopeless officials
Where’s the foul on Bowen that led to the red?
Rangers need to take note of a 10 man West Ham digging out a result
BT SPORT IMPROVE YOUR VIDEO ENCODING  CHALLENGE
Not even a foul, let alone a red haha
BT Sport turning the compression up to 11
Corrupt referee.
Ref is a disgrace
What an awful red card decision. The ref should be appalled with his decision and the player just as much for his diving theatrics. Shocking.
Should’ve showed dembele’s wink after the diabolical decision for a red card
I don't even think that was enough contact to be considered a foul let alone a straight red, there was a man over ans the ball was running away from Dembele. Shocking decision.
keep in mind this was the same ref that bellingham called out for match fixing. He was also banned for 6 months a few years ago bc of match fixing.
Just need a good ref in return.West Ham will do them.👀⚽️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Terrible defending by no 31 in the Lyon goal.
Scandalous refreeing lol. Not a West ham supporter but they got screwed with some dodgy decisions
WORST REF OF ALL TIME
cheating cnut
The fact that no Cresswell next game and both bowen and Antonio are both on yellow cards for no reason, gonna be a hard game
BT really need to sort out their encoding on these videos. Pretty bad quality...
I’m getting royally sick of benrahma. He has been completely shocking the last few weeks, and he is getting praised for the 2 good thing he does each game, and not punished for the 15 bad things he does
This ref has been done for match fixing and he’s still a referee and allowed to ref a football match especially when it’s this type of match absolutely ridiculous
Bowen should be playing for England. He’s miles better than Ollie Watkins.
Every 50/50 decision was favoured to Lyon by the referee. I was astonished by the consistency of the Referee to buy all Lyons play acting and punish West Ham at every opportunity. Bowens  Yellow,  and stopping the game for non head injuries when we were in possession.
Shows that European refs hate English clubs, should be fired, happens all the time, ref was against us in this game, in the sevilla game, same with united In the champions league
All the football organisations need to address the BIG issue of diabolical referees. They are ruining our game week in week out.
Ref is match fixing
A love all the salty English fans like we don't see dives week in week out in England this kinda foul happens alltime in England stop ur winging
Referred should never ref again, same referee who had been involved with max fixing and Jude Bellingham called him out for it.
I know a lot of comments are about the ref; and rightly so, but I have a more important question:  Why was this filmed on a potato?
Dawson Lofted through ball 🥶🥶🥶
A lot of the Hammers woes were self inflicted.
Red or not it is still frustrating to see a player can't keep his hand to himself. Why touch his arm and give any chance at all for that decision. If he wanted to touch him get his number after the game.
was a mouse co- commentating?
Was at this match ref was shocking and the pitch invasions were stupid and stopped us from defying the odds and winning
Looked like Antonio bottled it at 1-0 up
There's zero chance that's a red.
never a red theres minimal contact where there is no way it would make him go down
COYI!!!!!⚒️
Cresswell very unlikely to get sent off, Why on earth did Maxwell Cornet choose to play for Burnley in a relegation battle then playing in Europe for Lyon? 🤯🤦‍♂️
Craig Dawsons passing ability is severely under appreciated
jarrod bowen will be sort after by big clubs in the summer
soft red but at the same time silly to grab him like that, even tho he barely touched him.
Lol at the woman commentator that called Lyon "Leon". It's pronounced like LION she should go her research
Not a red card at all.
Referee was so poor all game, completely lost the plot
Has to be one of the poorest excuses for a red card I have seen (and I'm not even a Hammers fan)..
West ham should sell antonio and should replaced by ivan toney
A lack of understanding of the continental game cost West Ham the win, the players need be more savvy to the antics of players in European cup competitions, it's nothing new English teams used to struggle with this in Europe during the early 90's and 00's. West Ham are on a  European learning curve.
One season wonder
It was definitely a dive and a very soft red but there was no reason for Cresswell to touch him. As soon as he did he gave the player/referee that opportunity.
Ref should be fined wasn’t a goal scoring opportunity
A referee done for match fixing, is allowed to ref a european final....disgusting from eufa
If Antonio didn’t jump over the goalkeeper would of got pen and a red card
the red card was a absolute joke ..the ref is a clown.....good battle with the Frenchies....and come on u irons u can win the second leg!!!  canary Mel...💛💚
I'm a canary for life...but always had a soft spot for the hammers......good luck to them all the way to the final...maybe v rangers ..that wud be a good good match.....my two other favourite teams...so win win....Canary Mel...💚💛
Yarmalenko and Thiago Mendes get a +1 upgrade
Clear faul. Right red
Haha red card for that
Sorry but that was never a red card in any way shape or form. Brushed his shoulder and went down like a sack of spuds. Poor reffing there. Yellow card for simulation on Dembele would have been the right call there. Shocking decision. (Not a West Ham fan)
Female commentators make the game boring.
Having watched this as someone who isn't a West Ham fan, extremely soft red card, he's going far too wide for it to be a CLEAR goalscoring opportunity, Cresswell literally places a hand across his shoulder and he goes down like he's been shot, and it is Moussa Dembele who's through so he'd probably have missed anyway. UEFA on the whole are awful towards English clubs, refs are always way more harsh and let other European sides get away with diving or blatant fouling a lot more.   Football on the whole needs a massive reform when it comes to officiating, it needs to be consistent and fair.
That Ref is an Absolute Joke... Obviously on the take.
German “ref” Felix Zwayer got caught accepting a €300 bribe from organised crime to influence the outcome of a game back in 2005, he only got a 6 month ban as he sung like a canary. The guy is crooked and shouldn't be officiating European football.
That was a red card because its the last man
Red Card all day........ Lyon are gonna smash the Hammers in France....they are a good team!!!
Not a hammers fan but would love to see them go to the end . Up the irons
Bowen is class
Craig Dawson is so good get him in the England team
BT need to sort out their video settings. It's been like this for a couple of years now. Please have your producers look up interlaced video.
What Mafia bribed the referee for this game? He last took money off the Croatians.
The red card was Zouma's fault. If he hadn't given up on the chase and had run into the box, then Cresswell would not have been the last man and the ref could not have given the red card.
A german ref helping a frog side? Jee I never.
No females pundits please.
Soon football will be a non-contact sport lol
How can these Refs be getting paid ?
That red card was pathetic. If that’s a red card then football can no longer be a contact sport
Antonio busted a gut to get there but didn't even try to connect properly with the ball. Maybe he believed the keeper was going to get there first: but good opportunistic strikers depend on them not.
I was at the game and I have to say, very good atmosphere! But one minor thing is when west ham made an attack with rice fornals and antonio in attack, a fan rather stupidly decided to run on the pitch and stop the games momentum. I'm not saying we would've scored from the attack by any means but we had a jolly good chance at it. Not complaining about the result either, very impressed about the lads performance last night despite the controversial decisions by the referee, looking to improve in France. COYI ⚒️⚒️
A shocking red card decision
Can’t help but feel West Ham really needed a home win in this tie, will be interesting in Lyon
Antonio is West Ham’s biggest issue he’s an awful striker and gets way to much praise because of the team around him, his only attribute is strength, if West Ham got themselves a decent striker they’d be in such a good place
Why on earth does the ref stop the game for tackles not involving the head? As soon as he blows the french fakers get up.
How did VAR not tell him to look at that, it was never a red card. Cresswell barely tapped him on the shoulder
Yes Tanguy
Cheating referee
West Ham are massive
The referee was banned for accepting bribes and match fixing, yet he’s allowed to referee a quarter final?!?!
Never a red
I don’t understand why VAR isn’t used for contentious decisions like that red card. That ref has ruined the game completely. I don’t support either team, but as soon as I saw this happen I switched to watch Barca-frankfurt instead. It completely ruins the feeling of the game for fans and non fans. Decisions like that should and need to be reviewed, it’s not a foul in any sense, it’s ruining the game completely, almost as if it’s becoming a non-contact sport like basketball.
The ref can't keep getting away with it
How can a co commentator be this bad lmfao, Dembele gets someone sent off with a full second half to go rather than taking a shot going away from goal on the stretch, "I think Dembele would have been better off taking the shot." 🤣🤦👍
Leaves are stronger than these pathetic diving footballers
Think the ref was English he was that bad, absolute disgraceful performance from him
Antonio 👎
Who here supports West Ham
I’m a Man United and that’s not a red card
Well done for removing the wink, idiots
Seeing decisions like this more and more. Was the contact enough for Dembele to fall over? Of course not. Most penalties given is minimal contact. Zaha went down like he'd been sniped with barely any contact. But on the balance of the stupid decisions we see these days it is a red card. We're too far gone and been allowing soft "fouls" for years when really it is diving, exaggerating contact is still a dive.
Not a West Ham fan but it did seem a lot of decisions went against them even the pundits thought so. Also thought there was a foul on Bowen deep in Lyons half that went unpunished and from that Lyon set up the attack that resulted in the sending off.
Common West ham they are massive everywhere they go Respect from Germany
Surely that’s not a red card? Slightest touch and going away from goal?
I think it probably was a red to be honest, but these highlights really don't show any of the refs howlers through the rest of the game. Lyon players being fairly tackled and going down, staying down and the ref happily stopping play for them when we had possession. Letting them try again on the foul throw. The Bowen yellow card. The man was just appalling, Lyon are a grubby little outfit who should embarrass their fans but there were only about 20 of them in the ground.
How do refs get away with this and not have to answer for it. Football is corrupt to the core. The last 20 years the integrity in our sport has vanished. We openly allow cheating to be a part of the game. FA and fifa should be coming down much harder on divers, where has the respect gone in football. Could learn a lot from Rugby union. Great refs.
That red card is a joke
I managed to stop that annoying whiney sound coming from commentator's mic. I turned off the volume so I do not suffer her voice. Women can commentate on their 'football' lets keep tradition -  next we will have to have quota of trans, lbgtqa+ yadada in every team.
Ref had an awful game. Made so many bad descisions. West Ham should have won. The ref was on Lyons side
Bowen deserves an England call up he was absolutely class tonight
How is that not a red card? Through on goal, Cresswell takes him out. The English commentators 🤦🏻‍♂️
It was definitely a red dembele is through on goal
Also that was never a red card
Antonio is a work horse but West Ham are a striker away from being a top side, Alfredo Morelos would be a great signing for them
Shocking, obviously a fixed match again in a EUFA competition. This is why EUFA needs ousting and a new competition set rises up.
No way that was a red
Come on West Ham, was never a red still a good result
No way is that a red.
Who was the CB that just stopped running before the red card? I would be fuming with him if I was moyes. If he kept running and got in between the player and the goal, it would have turned that red into a yellow.  Awful by the CB
In the case of the red, it was a foul but it was never ever a red
What an idiot Cresswell is ......... SMH
How is that referee allowed to referee any game? He is an utter cheat.
Never a red card and ref had a shocking evening.
If Zouma had actually sprinted back he’d of been in a position to stop that being a red, would have just been a foul. The fact he ball watched and just tottered back ment it was last man
That was a dive
The West Ham fan invading the pitch to disrupt a West Ham attack was by far the biggest highlight of the night.  Brain dead hammers 😂
It is good  too see a side like West Ham doing good
Antonio could have got that if he didn't sht himself
Ref get done for match fixing yet are allowed to return and then put in this sort of performance.  Everything that is wrong with European football
Standard European officiating. 0 common sense!
Feliz Zwayer (the ref) has a track record of match fixing and taking payments. He should not be allowed to be involved in the sport.
It’s a clear foul by Creswell. He denied a clear goal scoring opportunity. Don’t know why so many people are sticking up for animal abuse fc
Red card or not Lyon would still beat West Ham
Well done, Tanguy
Why when the Lyon players fall over and stay on the ground (not head injuries) allow play to go on then decide to stop it later on in the move? ive never seen that before really bizarre officiating to say the least, why didn't VAR go back to the foul on Bowen in the build up to the goal?
WHY DIDNT THEY SHOW THE DEMBELE WINK???
Still having to suffer this awful, unqualified co-commentary.
Disgusting red, disgusting officiating all game and awful simulation by Lyon players throughout the whole game. Whenever their players went down they hadn’t even been touched and the only times our players did they were bleeding and needed actual treatment (Dawson and fredericks). So proud of our boys we were against it all and still got a draw. Dawson is an absolute warrior. COYI
0:33 that ball and touch is amazing
english commentators are biased
What a fkin stupid referee
It’s not a red card but what was he thinking? He’s going away from goal zouma covering creswell had no need to put his hands on him.
All to play for in the second leg!
Yes! Tottenham still torment west ham whilst not even playing , funny stuff
Good luck hammers! Hopefully see yous in the semi if we can overcome a 1-0 deficit next week 🤞
That female co-commentator is so irritating, can't she speak without breaking her sentences up into 3 word chunks? It gets very ... irritating to ... listen to that ... sort of ... robotic ... uninsightful waffle.   If we have to have female ex players, who have no idea what its like to play infront of more than 3/4k people, at least get one that can speak properly
Cresswell stupid to grab him like that, would have actually had more chance of it not being a red if he had slid in and at least tried to play the ball
Was barely even a yellow card. Ridiculous
This ref should never be allowed to ref again. useless game ruining biased
I’m not a West Ham fan, but no bloody way was that a penalty or a sending off!!! Disgraceful referee!!!!!!
Vile noise ruined the game
Once again the 14yr old boy is back commentating im out
Disgusting even looking at the comments not one person believes it was a red . Why wasn’t var used so he could of looked properly and he would of seen never a red
We did amazingly well against 12 men
Why didn't BT show the Dembele wink 👀
Vlasic ,  I love him!! Honestly hope he gets more game time , celebrates like a player that loves the club
Bye bye 👋
Bowen!
To the west ham fans going over there for the 2nd leg make sure to stick in groups. The Lyon ultras are a bunch of cowards.
I think the referee thought Lyon were playing Arsenal with that red card 😂
How's that a red card..what s joke decision
Ref waz poor..but so are lady commentators plz stop aving them on men's football very poor
Straight red. I dont understand what is shocking about it? Dembele took a touch forward towards the goal. Unfortunately but correct decision
Red card bollocks
This female commentator was honestly so bad
hope moyes wins west ham win this competition and I dislike the ckub
It wasn't clear on goal.
ref was absolutely awful. Jude Bellingham was right.
It’s mad to think I was a ball boy for Hull city in 2020 watching Jarod Bowen and celebrating goals with him. He gets a January move and now he playing in Europe and scoring too…. What a player ❤️
Foul was very deliberate, but maybe not a clear goal scoring opp. Just shouldn’t have given the ref the option in the 1st place.
After all these pissy boy Ronaldo  comments about how there was contact
Antonio absolutely bottled his chance unforgivable
If the red card is deemed a foul then surely 6:47 is a clear foul too. Should be a red.
Never a red
the Officials at 7.40 look like a pair of paid off crooks lol well done West Ham
Lyon had twelve men on the pitch.. the 11 team players plus the referee 🤡🤷‍♂️
As an Arsenal fan, That was one of the worse performances I’ve seen from a ref, kudos to West Ham I really hope they go all the way and win it
Is this the same ref Jude Bellingham said he was done for match fixing? Curious
That was a red card for what reason exactly. I’ve seen worse been given no card.
What did the Lyon manager say to Moyes after the game?
Absoloute joke of a red
Bowen take a bow son. Liverpool fan but what a balled this lad is. Absoulty class player and grafts too. Klopp spotted his talent couple years back. If salah went bowen be my 1st signing if possible
I don’t care what people say there’s no way that was a red card or a free kick
The wink from Dembele says it all
No where near enough contact for a red along with the ball travelling away from goal and zouma not too far, not a clear 1 on 1 chance
Don’t know why people are acting like that was a ridiculous red card decision. Shouldn’t be pulling someone back when they’re running towards goal like that.
one fell swoop ,mate.
refereeing is a joke
Ref should have a Lyon shirt
that red card has to be removed, dembele should be the one penalised for diving like that, get that out of the sport
I will never ever get used to woman commentating on mens football. Tennis yes but football no .
That should never have been a red card. Not even sure it was a yellow. If a grown man can't stay on his feet after a soft challenge like that then there's something badly wromg with him. Or he's cheating.
Dembele winding up the huns from Scotland and the huns from England, quality🤣
Worst referee I’ve ever seen !!!
spammers are turrrd sh*ite
So apparently that's not a red? Just be honest come on... West Ham played well and with 11 they might have won that game. A win in Lyon and nobody will talk about it
Straight red was very harsh
Clear Red he took down the last man pulling him back whats not red about it?
No controversy whatsoever, it was a crystal clear goal scoring opportunity and a red card any day of the week !
jarod bowen what a man
It seems like the refs have been getting worse with every game that goes by these days
West Ham have been nothing less of impressive this season ..
I mean it just is a red. There is 0 attempt from Cresswell to play the ball, yes it’s soft but the player is through 1 on 1 and cresswell has brought him down outside the area without trying to play the ball
Jesus games gone hella soft if that’s deamed a red.
the commentator when west ham scored: 🤩 when lyon scored: 😐
Love Bowen he's awesome definately a new England lad
It’s a 50/50 with the red. Unlucky West Ham
How was that a red pahahaha
The ref was absolutely awful I couldn’t believe what I was seeing!!!
one 'foul' swoop... At least it's football related..
I don't support either team but that wasn't even a yellow!!!!!
I'd love to spark Dembele out.
10 man West Ham beat 12 man Lyon would’ve been an adequate title
100% a red it’s called a professional foul doesn’t have to be a leg breaker to be a red people need to learn the rules of football
As a complete neutral, how can ANYONE complain about that Red Card. He was pulled back and denied a clear goalscoring opportunity! 100% the correct call.
Worst case that’s a yellow and that’s harsh. A red is just suspicious.
Terrific result under the circumstances - well done, West Ham!
The ref was the only winner tonight. Made a fortune.
Can we appreciate that touch by Benrahma at 38 seconds? Like old school Fifa control
such a ratty goal from Lyon
0:39 benrahma ball control equals to some players career 😉
It wasn't a red card, it wasn't even a foul.
It's a weird one because it's inbetween a yellow and red
I'm not a Hammers fan, but I can honestly say that that was one of the harshest decisions I've seen all season - Dembele still had a lot to do with the angle. What was even _more_ irritating was the referee constantly blowing to stop the game for Lyon “injuries” despite no foul or any actual injury... I thought the rule was only for head injuries? Or at least serious ones? Just makes the red card look like an absolute farce, especially when Dembele winked at the camera.
Dodgy red card but it's only West Ham so  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hope the ref gets spat in
The ref has rttf Denayer...
Embarrassing that they gave a red for that.
If that’s a red card then Richard Keogh is the GOAT
England should never be allowed 4 teams in champs league absute joke. First should qualify then the rest should play 5 qualifying games gaurentee they don't even qualify
I was at the game. Feels even worse watching this red card decision back. VAR proving itself useless
Hmm they didnt show the dirty wink though
Never a red, not even a West ham supporter but Jesus that was soft!
As a reading fan I can say with gusto and confidence that was never a red
The ref was appalling
Bowen is clear.
If only referees had common sense... oh wait, they're a bunch of brainless jobsworths. 🙄
Had a Lyon player carried out that challenge on a West Ham player, the home fans would have been screaming for a red card - so, please, no indignation or crocodile tears - just deal with it....
If Lyons dives were in these highlights it would be an hour long
Have they got rid of that flipping cat kicker yet?
This is the same ref Bellingham was talking about btw. Don’t know how he still has a job🥴
THAT WAS A RED ALLDAY. THANKS REF
who else but the referee that has been done twice for match fixing to referee our game 🤡
Never a red car imo
Zouma jogging. If he sprinted, maybe he could have argued more strongly that he was the last man
People don’t realise the level Bowen is at
Antonio jumping the challenge was criminal. Should have been 2-0 if he had any bravery.
so who was the biggest villian of the night? a) the ref, for a shocking display of officiating, b) Dembele, for drawing the red card foul (and got caught winking about it), or c) that muppet who ran onto the pitch in the middle of a potential West Ham opportunity?
Jared Bowen for 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 1st 11  Honestly , he really has that all round game that we need
On other channels, Dembele winks at his bench after the sending off, suggesting he put in an Oscar performance and got the result he wanted. Ref should at least checked VAR (Was it available?) in such an important match.  Not a West Ham fan but wanted them to win.
Clear red
For anyone who didn't watch the full game it isn't just the controversial red, the ref was horrendous from start to finish. Condoning Lyon's diving and cheating, allowing them to retake foul throws and generally giving them the decision in any 50-50. Given his record with match fixing it was very suspicious stuff.
I don't support west ham but love rice and Bowen really good players believe second leg bring it home for britian
I wish that female commentator would quit or shut up
It was a red
Stone wall red card. That boxing commentator totally bias and clueless
West ham a proper team this year . I'm sure they can go on and reach the final . Was a red card I think . Shame Cresswell is playing well .
Clear Red card for me.  Leave the Ref alone!
Jarrod Bowen is the best player in England hands down, arguably one of the best wingers in the world, and he’s only going to get better. What a player
Well done West ham. From Arsenal Fan. There wasn't a red card by the way.
The scenes if West Ham face Barcelona in the semis.
As a Grimsby Town fan I can say that was never a red
that benhrama touch was so ridiculous
A terrible decision from the ref that tried to ruin our night but we stuck in hard and showed we will always be a problem. Not many people will say it but Ben Johnson was top class when he came on to cover.
Never a red. Ruined what would’ve been a great game and West Ham would’ve probably got more out of it. Dembele is an embarrassment for that and how a referee can officiate a game this big after match fixing is beyond me.
antonio what a miss !!!
That's not a red in my opinion, well done to West ham they held it down .
That ref was the worst ever seen tonight
Sorry but I’m really confused as to why soo many are thinking it shouldn’t have been a red!? As if it’s a foul, then it’s denying a clear goal scoring opportunity, so it’s ether a play on and no foul, or a foul and a red, but how people are giving yellows and such just doesn’t make sense.  As yeah the Lyon players gone down very easily, but in today’s football that’s how it is.
Moyes, not only should he get the player's to practise penalties, but to feign challenges as well; simulate agony, that sort of thing - aka - 'the dark arts', to win some decisions, next time. Hopefully, a different ref, will officiate. Pete
Is it me that thinks West Ham need a striker Antonio doesnt score a lot dont remember the last time he has scored
BT Sport still cannot correct the lines all over the screen 5 years later
That aint a red card yellow at best west ham robbed there
Played against 12 men for the whole game. Disgraceful refereeing
Worst Refereeing performance I have seen in my life, the guy shouldn't be near a football match ever in his life again!
I think that's a red.  I don't want to see it given but by the rules, it is a red card.
Best watched without the commentary,  just saying 😉.   Any replies from the woke mob will be dutifully ignored.
They did really well with 10 men and a sh*t ref.
West Ham fans should be proud of the players who performed remarkably well.
Bowen.... If Grealish is worth £100,000,000 - how much can Bowen be worth? If City offered a straight swap: Grealish for Bowen, West Ham would put the phone down on them.
Ref was clearly against West Ham, disgusting
Spot the difference in excitement between the two goals, english bias
Let's be honest, its a 50/50 red card. The English bias in commentary is so annoying
West Ham; 51 years; Creswell pulled; simple as!  Anyone saying it was soft; fair enough; but don’t put yourself in that position! We played well and I’m happy enough.  Bring on the 2nd leg.
Lyon🤡🤡🤡🤡
Omg that’s never a red
That ref😡😡😡😡
Dembele should have been shown a yellow
shocking footage
Match fixing as it's finest
Only want lyon to win so my thiago mendes gets upgrades on fifa 😂
Creswell's red should be given to Antonio for failing to score when Bowen set him up with a magnificent run and cross. Antonio was more concerned with not going in to the keeper but he should have buried the shot and let the keeper worry about being clattered.
I believe it SHOULD be a red, but those are never given so it's pretty unfair.
Lyon deserved to win west ham were poor throughout
Sharsh red card on cresswell it was a slight tug on the shoulder and dembela know what he was doing and denying of a goal scored opportunity, Zouma should of Run and helped him instead of jogging but now we take it into the second leg next week. All to play for coyi whtid. ⚽️⚽️⚽️
BT Why does all of your football content have lines through it? Such awful video quality
Never a red
No way a red
clear red pundits with all their English bias to an average west ham team Lyon should of won the referee had a very good game
Soft foul but it’s a clear goal scoring opportunity. Zooms is nowhere near getting there and Dembele’s touch stays central, not our wide. People deluded by the commentator saying he was heading out wide
What happened to VAR? What. An absolute joke
What’s everyone crying about? Clear as daylight red card. Last man, arm from behind him at pace he is obviously going to go down. Why Zouma starts jogging I’ll never know
ref needs bank balance checked, horrendous
Fuming! ref was a ?&*"3
Wasn’t just the red. The referee was absolutely awful the whole game. Makes Mike dean look a decent ref
Thought the title said ‘10 man hammers fight against 12 man Lyon’
0:49 - that touch
If it was the other way round the commentary would of been screaming for a red. English media and English fans always want to play the victim.
German referee and French club   We were always going to be up against it really
never a red from a Chelsea fan
For everyone saying it was a red, ref gave absolutely everything Lyon’s way from the first minute. Also, it wasn’t a red
Dembel end is a cheat ,there is no way that was a straight red card.The ref should be given a red card for that decision.Come on lads sort it out for next weeks 2nd leg and give them a walloping in front of their home supporters.
Hammers were  great and were robbed
dembele fell several paces after cresswell had brushed his arm. never a foul, never a red.
We moan about our refs being bad. I don’t think this ref was any better
need that jason denayer upgrade cmon
The sooner human referees are replaced with a fully automated and consistent AI system trained on thousands of hours of video footage, the better.
A classic example of a red card ruining a great game. I believe West Ham would’ve won on the night if they hadn’t lost Aaron, all the best for next week - do the country proud 👊
The Lyon forward on the penalty....FFS, that was weak and he went down like a sack of s**t !!!......Fooled the ref though...
Come on West Ham
havent seen such a biased referee since Man city V Everton
Running away from goal and with a central defender still there…how is that ever a red?
defo a red
Suiiiii
Lol shocking ref
please tell me its a different ref in the second leg!!
The way Dembele fell was comical 😂
Never a red
I’m not even a West Ham fan but that’s never a red imo
In what world is that ever a red?
The ref is a joke, it's just cheating.
Good solid result with 10 men ⚽️
Need to see paqueta in the prem soon Chelsea need to snatch him up. Gives me Bruno vibes Icl
Bowen is just being Bowen wherever he goes! But the ref needs glasses just like the rest of the referees recently they have been playing unfairly in my opinion!
Give credit to West Ham they do a lot better in Europe compared to Tottenham lol
Never a red. We move on to the 2nd leg. We can do this!!
Never a red card. Very poor call. I would’ve given a yellow card. Direction was not towards goal so it isn’t a clear goal scoring opportunity.
If Bowen was 3 years younger, he’d easily be in the England squad.
Cresswell should never have been sent off
Referee had his Lyon shirt on tonight I see
Ref was terrible
Ref was the 12th man
Auoar we lads?
Since the euros, the quality of refereeing in both the premier league and most European competitions have been abysmal. Needs looking at!
Lyon are a lot more technically gifted compared to West Ham but the straight up power of their midfield players and the strength of the strikers make up the loss of that technical ability
the bowen yellow at the end was worse tbh
7th
As an honest Hemel Hempstead fan, I felt West Ham got unlucky and will still progress to the semi finals 🍣🍣
Lyon is so dead 💀 Gosh
Bowers on fire 🔥
IRONS⚒⚒⚒
Terrible ref
Great game
Jude Bellingham was right.
Great match 👍
Ref was a joke
Defo not a red lmao
Fianlly
Joke
