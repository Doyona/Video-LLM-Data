James Franco is Napoleon to my Josephine. James was always destined for greatness whereas I was always destined for failure. In my next life, I’ll come back as the true Emperor of Hollywood. - By Tamara O’Connell xoxo

Ridley Scott made great Pictures for this Film, but he is a total Ignorant, when it comes to historic Accuracy. So watch Abele Ganceˋs Masterpiece or the wonderful Mini-Series with Christian Clavier, which is already the better Napoleon.
Could've been a great film if they had worked on the script with more effort.
france haunts me forever
I just watched this, and it was terrible.
There's nothing we can do
супер
France 🇫🇷 has not changed
RADIOHEAD
THE MEME    theres nothin we can do
It could have been a great film if it had been historically accurate. The settings, the locations & the atmosphere were great. It was just the most important thing that was missing - the historical accuracy.  Up to now I thought Ridley Scott had associated himself with some classic movies & I particularly liked his masterpiece - Alien.  Now, he's let me down. Maybe his advancing years has something to do with it.
Can’t afford even though I have ipad
When it coming for streaming
It’s my time to shine.
Лучший достоверный исторический фильм из всех что я видел в своей жизни
Great Movie much more attached to reality without romanticizing a tyrant presenting him as the human being with defects and virtues that he was.
