Harry Styles!😘🔥😘🔥😘🔥😘🔥😘🔥
Quem nao queria estar no lugar de Alice
Florence Pugh is an absolute gem of an actor. LEAGUES above whatever Styles was trying to do. Rightfully that role should've fallen on an actually trained acting talent. 😭   Movie was worth watching basically just for her performance. Maybe also for Pine's. And of course Libatique's cinematography
What an awful movie
I'm I wrong is this movie incel
Can someone explain this?
The humming ominous bgm ads up amazing
Wrong dinner scene. 😋
this scene genuinely gives me soooo much anxiety so much second hand embarrassment lmfao i guess that’s the point
0:03 0:11 0:16 0:22 0:27 0:33 0:47 1:18 1:26 1:32 2:01 2:10 2:56
Yooooooo knowing that the men know and are also perpetuating the simulation is even more insane when you see how they look at her
Macaroni all in my mind and one fork
Post--it taking making girl on dinner date even the paparazzi are scared you live once
This movie could've been rewritten multiple possible ways but I do appreciate Florence Pugh and Chris pine's acting. Also, I think there was too much pressure placed on Harry styles to be the main attraction and bad guy. I think it would've made more sense if they stuck with the original script and maybe look into jack trying to save their marriage by entering into this AI world. Also, the music score sucks and just feels like there's panting breathing. There's many times that music or sounds don't need to be included. I would rate this a 6/10 film, but honestly the story really does matter not just popular celebrity names.
Strange
🎉😢eejkn😮😅😂😢
God bless you all ❤❤
3:02 the « whaa ? » 😅 iconic English
❤
Harry so bad acting even force his movements …. So bad
I suppose to see the adds about the movie that I watched but what happened this time that you guys are behind few days ??
So dark the con of man.
Very poorly made film, but well-acted after.
The only good scene in the film
Watching this scene after seeing the movie and seeing the end, it’s totally wild. Watching the men’s reactions vs women’s, watching them nervously look at Frank for help. Wild. The acting here is great.
AMAZING MOVIE. 100% MUST WATCH LIKE INSANE! GREAT ACTING
All I can hear is "Kate Bishop" in a Russian accent LOL
How would jack not know that she left the program the first time when she touched headquarters? X
I really like Florence Pugh's speaking voice. I don't know why, but I do. It's pleasant. :)
Question. What is "the Truth"? Tried looking it up but didnt find anything sadly
The met the same way  as the Russian story with Vronsky
This is the scene where she plays in his face and ruins the dinner.
Context?
max original katana karen fukuhara filme
It's a good film
This is the 2nd time Asif Ali has been placed in 50's simulation world.
I love this movie
Looks like a reverse Barbie movie
Chris Pine plays a character with a clean room.
The casting of this movie was fantastic even the supporting characters. Florence chris and even harry did a good job
The psychiatric field of medicine is one of the most corrupt institutions on our planet ...most of it is not even science. You cannot prove their diagnosis in a lab ...all diagnosis are theory, conjecture and personal opinion.
florence PUG is so ridiculously beautiful. She's literal perfection.
This is like me trying to convince my father that he's a narcissist...
Is this a "stepford wifes" premise?
Florence Pugh is one of my favourite actresses ever. Shes amazing
Harry Styles is a pathetic actor. Garbage
I like this scene, but the music is really heavy-handed and distracting.
Great acting stuck in a story that gives up even trying to make sense by the end of the film
Is that harry styles 3:07
This IS Hollywood or Washington. Everyone wants to stay blind to crime to stay in their comfort
I’m seeing them all sit at the table and right now during filming is when Covid was spreading and no vaccines!!! 🫢. If I were an actor sitting at the table I’d be having a panic attack.
Only Chris Pine can be Capt Kirk and Evil Spock all at once
Good
Nice
What is the context for this? Lol I haven’t seen the full movie so
1:10
In this moment I thought this is going to be epic. Oh but give it 12 minutes to turn into a literal cluster
That actress Florence Pugh’ is English. She speaks with a English accents in real life. It’s amazing on how English/UK actresses/actors can performed with an American accents. Just like there are American actors/actresses who didn’t grew up in the southern parts of the USA. But when performing as playing a role as U.S southerners performing with a American southern accents.
So..........Stepford WIves remake?
filme parece ser bom  queria ser essa alice
Awful movie. If it wasn't for Chris Pine literally nobody would have gone to see this
Harry's character is everything Florence's character is not. He is a willing subservient pawn who just wants to get by. I think he did very well with that role.
I fell in love with Florence in that misdemeanor movie. She’s just adorable
Florence really did well on her american accent. Crazy. Love that girl.
@1:25 - 1:28, the sound editing there was genius…definitely added the tension to the room
Couldn’t she have said “None of this is real” AFTER we ate?
This movie is even creepier when u know the truth😩😩
Pine as bad guy works well. I have to see this.
This movie was great.
#Fuckfeminisim
So why does everyone hate Olivia Wilde now?? Im really curious 👀 lol
I absolutely love Florence Pugh!  Can anyone explain the plastic wrap scene? I didn't understand the purpose of her wrapping her face in plastic wrap and then ripping it off.
Olivia will go down in history as an example of toxicity femininity. Complete narcissist garbage.
Chris and Florence need to star together in a big picture. They were Golden here.
FIRE JAMES GUNN 🤢🤮
I love this movie so much, but I honestly hated the ending. I know they left it open for a sequel, but if they just added five more minutes movie, I would’ve been satisfied.
It’s a shame Florence and Chris’s performances were wasted in such a frustrating movie.
The first time I saw Florence Pugh was in “fighting with my family” and I was enamoured. It was clear back then that she was going to be huge. An Oscar candidate for sure.
Serious mind warp and it’s sad 😢
I love his Peterson impression. Didn't think he would pull it off, but he does it in a subtle way, where the eloquent personality is preserved. But the manipulative personality is added for a change, bringing about an intellectual antagonist.
So boring
I haven’t watched the movie. Can someone explain the scene? (Unless the explanation is like a major spoiler)
This movie was a great thriller. I hate when YouTubers jump on the clout bandwagon.
This scene was very clever and well done and I liked the movie~
The line at 0:10 "Are you serious?" is too modern for the era. It's a phrase that has caught on mostly in the past 15-20 years.
Do you notice? In real life they were not married, because her real friend in the hospital call her "Warner" (if i am not mistaken), and not "Chamber" as it should be if they were married she will use his last name right? So it is Jack's fantasy to be married with her and have all this life
Yeah this movie gets a lot of hate that it may not deserve
The Violet actress so gorgeous
Chris is such a hot villain 😩
Oh i thought this was the other table scene
Can you guys and New line cinema and platinum dunes please have michael bay,brad fuller,and andrew form on gettin back together with Samuel Bayer and Wesley strick and Eric heisserer and Steve Jablonsky and the rest of the crew and try to talk to Warner bros and New line cinema and platinum dunes on having them reviving/making a sequel to a nightmare on elm street 2010 and title it a nightmare on elm street 2 freddy's return and it should bee about nancy is now a paitient at westin hills hospital for years with 13 others who also have been dealing with freddy in the past and when freddy kuegger begins stalking thee occupants of the mental hospital it up too nancy and quentin to stop freddy once and for all!!!!!!!.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Ps the story about 13 others that who are with Nancy in thee mental clinic asylum hospital that they use to be 16 of them but Freddy Krueger killed 3 others along thee way and they were students and victims of Freddy Krueger too and please make the sequel elements similar to a nightmare on elm street 2 Freddy's revenge and a nightmare on elm street 3 dream warriors and please make the sequel now and release it in 2025 but if you guys can not release it in 2025 then u have my full permission to release it in 2026 then And also make a nightmare on elm street 3 and title it either a nightmare on elm street 3 dream fighters or a nightmare on elm street 3 dream masters or whatever and still have Rooney Mara and Kyle gallner and Jackie Earle Haley and possibly Clancy brown reprise there roles and make the sequel elements similar to a nightmare on elm street 4 dream masters and a nightmare on elm street 5 dream child and Freddys Dead the final nightmare and Wes craven the New nightmare and release that in 2028 but if you cannot release that in 2028 then you guys have my full extended permission to release that in 2029 then and also my ideas for a nightmare on elm street 2 Freddy's return and a nightmare on elm street 3 is too add lots of nudity scenes and tones of drugs an alcohol scenes moments and lot of 3D graphics parts too
maybe it’s just me, but i really liked this movie? i don’t know if the drama and politics surrounding it affected people’s feelings, or if i just have a terrible taste in movies, but i loved it.
the fact i had this scene imprinted into my brain since the day it came out is a problem basically call me alice chambers
the girl with short hair (Idont know her name) was so good in this scene. She got my attention.
She also should have pointed out that her friend is eternally pregnant but never gives birth!
Bro this is a reference to our government that has been poisoning our food. It’s insane!
This flick was a FLOP.
👍
Florence is absolutely amazing in every movie I see her in! She will always be my favorite celebrity! 💗
Her voiceeee😩😩😩
This movie stinks
Another horrifying thing i realized. Bunny referred to the other lady as "always pregnant", I was wondering what her backstory was as to why, then I realized it might be because her "husband" has a pregnancy fetish
Honestly, Florence Pugh and Chris Pine were the best part of the movie
What did frank mean when he said "i trusted you in my bedroom"
Damn this movie is bad.
It's all a virtual world,  styles character drugs his wife and puts her in it.  Utter shite.
This movie is a great movie if you haven’t you’ll want to see it the suspense isn’t out of this world but it’s there and it’s so much twists to this definitely a solid 9/10 it had me tuned in. All the actors in this is amazing Olivia did a great job despite the hate she gets.
Movie was just okay, but as usual Florence's performance was fantastic!
DIALOGUE: Alice: Violet where are you from? Violet: Pardon? Alice: I said where are you from? Violet:Philadelphia  Peg: um... I'm from Philadelphia  Violet: Are u serious? I didn't know that Alice: You know I like most the women here are from          Philadelphia or  Baltimore or Chicago. Peg: I haven't notice... I thrive in the  sunshine even though  I'm alabaster  skin Alice: I love the sunshine, I love the beach...            What was the last beach you went  to? Peter: Fun fuct about the beach I read this             the beaches are actually some of  the filthiest places in the whole  world just a sandbox of diseases... Alice: I could probably guess Hilton head?   Cape cod? Or the jersey shore? [Silence]            And we all honeymooned in sea  island or the Poconos or the Niagara falls..[silence] Bill: I think those are popular honeymoon destinations expensive Jack: you didn't finish your story Peter: Bill over here is probably one of the worst golf courses ... Alice: I'm not quite finished, Violet where  did you meet Bill? Violet; We met on a train Alice : to Boston? Violet: yes [laughs] Alice: You dropped your ticket and he bent  down picket it up gave it to you right?            It is right.            That's how Margaret met Ted and Peg I'm I right in thinking that that's  how Debbie McIntyre met her  husband.. yes I am, that's how they  met. Peg: yeah that's true I'm jealous honestly it's such a great story yeah it's not  funny it's coincidence incredible. Alice: there are only so many different stories the we're told,  we're told that  we remember until we try to remember things that they want us to forget like Margaret... Jack; Alice... Frank: No Jack it's okay. I'm curious to hear where she's going with this Alice: Frank is doing something to us   [silence] Frank: delusions, memory poblems, hysteria we saw this issues with Margaret and know that it's uh completely curable dr Collins   prescribed you a suite of medications which you are clearly  not taking the question is why .. Alice: he's lying to us he's lying to all of us Frank: Alice, bunny your best friend is worried about you she thinks that you need help is that why she's not here tonight because you didn't  went to be reminding  Alice: he's using all of us do you even what the victory project actually is have you ever asked ? Frank: do you? Is that what you went out there? To headquarters? Alice: I'm sorry,I'm so sorry but you don't  what he's doing  Jack: you wandered out by yourself you  ignored every rule Frank: and she put all of your lives in  danger
Boooooooooo!!
Regardless of the controversy around this film I saw it and it was quite good. Not the best thing I've ever seen but interesting and gripping.
So what is Florence Pugh doing in a DC movie? Will she not be in any future Marvel movies anymore? :/
OK movie but this scene took FOREVERRR
Florence Pugh and Chris Pine are real actors.
seeing her and chris be on the same movie reminds me of the outlaw king
Florence Pugh reminds me a lot of a younger Kate Winslet…
What's the difference between this and the Stepford Wives?
I saw the moment where Alice killed him in the movie
Why is Barry in a different position every second
Warner Bros. It's time for you to change in Warner Sis.
Frank begged Alice to confront him and she not only confronted but rejected him too.
Whenever I see Florence pugh I just hear a Russian accent
Wait wait wait ... What the heck Sersi and Yelena Belova Doing here on the DC universe 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I like it
best scene in the Film
Who is here for our Harry
Went into this movie after only seeing the one trailer & hearing nothing than the behind the scenes drama, so imagine my surprise when I completely fell in love with how dark & freaky this movie got! Oh I 😍🥰😍 this movie! It struck me deep in my soul with how terrifying the twist (NO SPOILERS HERE) was, and how well crafted the mystery was. This scene was my absolute favorite.  Did the film have problems? Oh a few problems yes (Harry Style's accent), but boy was this a tour de force for Florence Pugh. Cannot wait for awards season! This film should definitely get nominated for score, sound editing/mixing, and best actress for Florence Pugh. 😃
#whitemanbad
Florence Pugh is a queeeen and I’m kinda in love right now
This movie seems awful 😞
Boring movie.....don't waste your money ! Must be a lot of paid trolls making positive comments here about it.
Garbage🤮🤮🤮🤮
I really enjoyed the movie and thought it didn't deserve all the backlash.
Was this supposed to movitivate me to see the movie???
this movie is nothing but critisizing jordon peterson
this movie was great. florence killed it!
Film was a massive disappointment. It certainly didn't deserve Florence Pugh who gives another superb performance and does everything she can to maintain your interest in what is, ultimately, a very dull mess.
Personally I feel this movie would have done so much better if they just let the movie do the talking and not tying it to politics by making statements on what it is supposed to be. I am all for movies with politics for either side as long as they do two things. First they need to treat their audience like they are not stupid by not just stating the point and second they need to leave the politics in the movie. If you can’t get your point across in 2-3 hours and you feel the need to state the point in interviews and the likes then you have made a bad movie. This movie did not need to do this but by doing so it has dragged the movie down a lot unfortunately.
Loved the movie
Good to see Florence and Chris reunite, previous film they were lovers, this film exact opposite.
Movie seems hilariously bad which is a reason I watch movies, but I gotta support my man Edward Pedersen so I will be boycotting this one out
Trash
Even though the twist is incredibly predictable it's still a treat to watch such powerhouses acting off of each other.
"Matrix movie from Netflix" 🤡
Just remembr, you are the man in the chair.
The is beautiful
Very disaponiting 👎👎👎
Disappointment of a movie
I just saw this movie today, 09/30/2022. Fantastic movie. Males choosing careers over their wife and/or family. Rings so true of the males in todays society. Pitiful, but very true.
I'm going to watch it for Harry styles (: it looks fun
That bish isnt even talented or good looking or anything exceptional....just average
For all the films problems, Florence Pugh's great performance is not one of them.
I feel mixed on this one but I definitely will say, I love Florence Pugh!
Florence is gorgeous
wich one is jordan peterson?
what a dumb movie.  the 1950s were nothing like this.
For some reason Harry Styles could play as Newt from The Maze Runner if there’s a reboot. He’s giving me newt vibes lol
Jason Sudeikis is the most likeable guy in Hollywood, Olivia dumps him for a scrawny little dork. This world has gone whacky
This movie was great I dont understand the 'critics'
The plot twist in this movie is WILD
Does anyone else get the Stepford Wives vibe from the movie? I haven't seen it yet but is it anything like that?
looks really dumb, I can't see this being a success
“Can someone please pass the green bean casserole or is this a bad time”
This is diabolical. To be able to brainwash people so effectively and wipe their memories. These people are able to control people like helpless puppets. This must take more than just raw intelligence and organisation. I think the puppet masters have made a deal with Moloch. God Help Me Please
Am I crazy or is Chris Pine actually a young Guy Pearce?
Loved the 50s style sets & acting, direction was good. The only bummer is the plotline, goes nowhere in second half of movie & the Stepford Wives plotline has been done since the 70s!!
Not a single redeeming thing about this movie. All the actors are pretentious and bad people (even by Hollywood standards). The director is straight awful at being a human being. But NPCs have kept things like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" on TV for years so this will sadly do fine
Gemma Chan is exquisite. Don't get me wrong - Florence Pugh was great in the lead, but I have always had a soft spot for Ms Chan.
Jordan Peterson would not be sitting quietly like that, he would absolutely dominate a dinner table
If this is about Jordan Peterson then I’m guessing Hannibal Is about Nancy Pelosi!
This movie is seriously embarrassing. The USA is embarrassing itself on a global scale. This movie is just a toxic perspective of reality.
Too bad about the Peterson contravercy.
this movie was so much better than i thought it would
Dont worry Darling is masterpiece Hope Florence Will get Oscar
Can you guys post the scene right before this (Florence + Chris <3)
one of the only really good scenes in the movie imo. Really well done scene!
Shame on WB for Stealing and copyrighting other Content Creator’s material re Amber Heard
Great movie
Well, this was boring. Definitely didn't make me want to see it.
If this is supposed to be a "period" film -- the hair, clothes, makeup, accents all seem completely modern.
I don't really know anything about the drama surrounding this movie but I saw it and like it a lot, except for the ending. I was thoroughly entertained
This is what Paranoia looks like! So sad!
This is just the stepford wives 2022
Cancel white actors!! 😡✊🏿🏳️‍🌈
Love uuuu
That awkward silence is killin me..
Is that Harry Styles? Or am I blind?
florence and chris ate
the way i've memorized all of alice's lines in this scene
This has like Truman show vibes lol
Does she say "Sea Island" or "City Island" at 0:52?
Harry's acting doesn't seem so bad. I actually think he did a pretty good job, he did well compared to some new comers
This movie was absolutely phenomenal, Florence Pugh and Gemma Chan are some of my favourite actresses in the industry
Best movie 🍿 hands down this year !!!!!!!
Florence is so pretty. Just so pretty. I almost cant focus on the scene.
This movie is sick
This movie gave me a bit of anxiety 🥲😥
Saw this as an ad and was pretty intrigued so after I accidentally skipped it when it was almost over I came here to finish watching
Gemma is wearing the same dress Audrey Hepburn wore in Sabrina
Florence pugh is such a great actress
I always skip movie trailers but this has to be the first one I attentively watch
This movie was amazing
The plot of this movie reminded me so much of the Twilight Zone, I LOVED it! I loved the acting, seeing Harry Styles in a big movie (I've been a fan for years!), the soundtrack (knew almost all the songs), the clothes and cars and I just feel like this was so artistic and unique. I may go see it a second time!
For those saying beaches are ugly I think Portugal, Australia, Ibiza, Japan are better than USA
Saw DWD tonight and my friend and I both said afterwards that we couldn’t see Shia LaBeouf playing that part? I’ve read a lot of negative reviews about Harry’s acting so I may be in the minority here but I thought he did great and liked him very much in the role as Jack.
Florence is really coming up I love her acting
This film was PHENOMENAL. You will not walk away the same.
This looks so interesting, but it’s so odd seeing a period piece being spoken/acted in such a modern manner.
Florence’s American accent sounds so much like Selena Gomez
This movie was GOOD AF 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 it was everything I expected and I’m not mad at that 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
If Pine's character doesn't say "Clean your room" in the movie , I'm walking out of the theatre.
Constance is so orange here she looks like an oompa loompa
I loved this movie so much.
Good acting doesn’t matter much when the writing sucks 💀
This is just like Pleasantville
I loved this scene at the start of act 3….. I loved the movie
This rivals the Grey’s Anatomy thanksgiving dinner table scene in awkwardness aha
Damn I never thought Florence could be so scary
What movie is this
I’m still waiting to see evidence of this phenomenal acting from Pugh. This scene feels like how a girl acts in her head when she wishes she had been more assertive (“If I could do it again, I would have said THIS to them.”) I wouldn’t say this is exactly bad acting, but it’s certainly not as praise-worthy or realistic as what I’m seeing it praised for.
i actually really want to see this, the plot intrigues me🤔
future razzy winners
Wow... There is so much going on in this scene. The full movie looks really deep.
Holy criminy that looks intense!! Smoldering intensity (y)
Am I the only one who thinks this looks comically silly?
I know I’m supposed to be scared of him in this movie but I love Chris Pine so much. Seeing him as a villain, it just makes me so proud of him 😅
These 2 were great together in “The Outlaw King”
from this clip it's giving stepford wives
Harry should explore his singing venture more than his acting venture. Shia why you had to be an A-hole , look what you made olivia do [cast Harry styles].
This seems like a cross between Roman Polanski's, Rosemary's Baby and Jordan Peele's, The Get Out!
Haven't seen this movie, but remember stepford wives.  My daughter went into college; ;within 3 months she was telling me strange things.  I explained to her, truth is truth and false is false.  As I got more involved and noticed things, all I can say is she was in an unusual post-covid scare tactic inner circle orchestra thing....that was well not good for her.  It is important to understand what is true and what is "real".  In any situation.  Basically, people afraid they were going to lose their jobs; causing such stress on the staff and the students.  I told her.  MUSIC is not going away even if their program is.  As she continued to hold onto her Christian values, things got worse.  We had to pull her out of there.  Fortunately, she knew herself enough to "question" the situation .  This scene is almost exactly what she was up against.  It took us 2 months to "de-program" her so she could relax and come back as herself again.
I love Florence Pugh but each clip of this film I find it hard to believe this is set in the 60’s. The costumes Colours cinematography scream 2020’s.   I feel bad for her having to work triple duty to carry this film, judging from all of the reviews.   And I find people interesting… if a film with stars the general pubic  like gets critically derided, then the critics know nothing.   Yet if the public derides it, than the public knows nothing…   So basically all criticism is ignored or invalid in the eyes of the lowest common denominator… but good reviews we should take as gospel? No questions asked?
i never see florence act bad as in in every movie shes in its like a new person a raw person not a person from films or scripts.
Smart to put this little free appetizer out on YouTube. Maybe some people will go to a theater? Florence Pugh is "cute as a button."
i love the intensity created by these actors. so entertaining!
i just saw this movie in theaters, im surprised by the direction of Olive Wild i think she will go far as a director, the acting of the cast was great and i loved the plot and twist of the movie. Florence and Chris were great, i really recommend this movie
this looks awful
I need to see this movie just because of all the drama behind the scenes lol
man I'd like to clap Florence's cheeks so bad
Excited to see Florence in a movie not with 🐕💩 writing also Chris is legendary🍿
Obvs Pugh and Pine are amazing, but let's take a moment to acknowledge how GREAT Kate Berlant (woman in the red/pink) is in this scene!
I have no clue or context to this scene with these people talking around a dinner table, but I felt the need to watch the next part like I had been watching the entire movie lol
this reminds me of wandavision, specifically when vision started to question westview and wanda…
Yeah and I was really annoyed at how people were like Harry can't act like it looks like he is acting pretty good in that scene to me
Elena Belova?
which part of Chris Pine's character represent Jordan Peterson
Man I love Chris Pine. Amazing actor!
this movie could be what’s happening irl
Florence Pugh making everyone uncomfortable at the dinner table is such a mood.
without the horrible acting of harry the movie looks great
this is so unsettling, i can’t wait to see this.
Florence Pugh is incredible. I’m not sure if I am going to watch this, but if I did it would be because of her!!!
DAMNNNN i wanna watch this now!
Oh this is gonna be so good
Fire
Is it only me or this movie is kind of similar to the model citizen series?
why florence still hasn't won an oscar??
Florence we love u
Damn, Chris Pines Jordan Peterson impression is on point
I CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE😅 I really do not care about the drama and I'm not interested to learn more. I'm here for FLORENCE PUGH and CHRIS PINE'S ACTING💖💖💖
yelena, eros, sersi, and norm lmao
Violet is actually stunning 😮
This looks boring
Haan bc Puri movie hi leak kyu nai kardete?
Harry playing a character named Jack just suits him.
Am I the only one who thinks this is exactly like that one Greys Anatomy scene where Meredith calls out Penny? 💀
The acting: amazing. Harry Styles: AMAZING.
this was actually really interesting, i really wanna see it now
harry styles is a good actor (:
seems ehhh, but Florence kills it in most of her performances, so I'll wait for it to come out on streaming on HBO Max
Florence Pugh is just pure talent
damn that was instense...
She's so good
is this movie any good?
This movie is really truly reminding me of the stepford wives(1975)
But wait, the movie looks good 👀
Yawn.
The inconsistencies in the editing of where styles’ hand is on his face is so annoying lmao
Florence and Chris. Just incredible
It’s giving me The Truman Show vibes
all is good I just think Harry is so out of place
#b5oncwin23
Why Florence talk like wanda
wandavision did it first
I have a feeling it's like a 50s and 60s place when in the real world they're in the 2020s 😆
Stepford wives vibes or im reaching?
I’ve never even heard of this movie but it came up in my stream because of Florence Pughes and it’s literally the creepiest thing ever
Parasite Prison
Chris what are you doing? Diana is waiting for you get tf back 😡
i am seeing this movie on friday wowow
I'm watching this for Chris and Florence
Omg like it is such a good chance to Florence to show her talent and get and Oscar. But beacuse of the drama nobody likes this movie
Omg so good. Such a brilliant actress
Harry Styles?  I thought Olivia was secretly dating 🤔 Ralph Fiennes!😳 ....BTW, I'm not about to spend any money getting my head spun around for 2hrs- no matter how "compelling" these actors look and sound.
I love Miss Flo.
I love Chris Pine’s voice
One scene has me on edge, so excited to see this
Since Olivia Wilde said it all I can see is Jordan Peterson. Chris is doing really good impression of him probably coz Olivia asked him to imitate him. I dont hate jordan Peterson btw. But i think the impression is nice
I really must live under 2 rocks bc I didn’t even know about controversies behind this movie… someone give me cliff notes! But most importantly… regardless of the drama is it still a good movie?
I feel like this movie is going to be much better than people are saying
This kinda gives me Stepford Wives but with a more serious thriller tone than the campy one with Nicole Kidman
Damn after knowing the ending and the twist of this movie this clip is so obvious as to what’s going on 😂
Yelena, Norm(WandaVisiion), Starfox and Sersi having a dinner together in Earth-620
This movie sucked 👎🏻
I did tell need help parents brother family members troubling
Is good
This movie looks interesting.
Reminds me of wandavision in episode 1
Can’t wait to watch this
This looks like such a good movie. I can't wait to see it.
i actually rlly want to watch this now
The editing  is making me nervous. I hope it's just this clip and not the movie.
too bad we can't go back in time and make this movie centered around Chris and Florence's characters 😔 that would have ate so bad.
This looks good. a psychological thriller about people being used as Guinea pigs but most are too stupid to see it. I’ll have to check this out.
I was gonna watch this for Florence , harry and Chris I didn’t expect the movie to be good but this is one of my favourite movies yet now!
I read somewhere this movie got negative reviews or something. I don't see why. I was really interested in what was happening. I will watch it. Pugh is impressive.
Wow😱😍just wooooooow😍🫰
Florence! Your a queen darling! Watching for you!
I cannot wait to see this movie lol
In the 50's everyone asked their token Oriental and Hindu friends to join their dinner parties.
*This movie looks so good but I think it looks good because Florence is in it* 💀
I thought that was a fart at the end.
Chris Pine’s cadence. Whew. This is gonna be GOOD.
When will "Teen Titans" Season 6 release? Will it take place? Everyone hopes and waits for this season.
Don't spit darling
Love me some Florence Pugh!!
Seems kind of similar to Vivarium 🤔
Anyone notice the quick glance Chris Pine gave to the other man at the table? His eyes winked as if to say “go along with this.”
This looks good. But comparing Jordan Peterson to Chris Pine’s character is such a stretch. Gonna pirate this.
Oooh, looks intense. Wish it was on demand for streaming. I'm not going to be able to make it to the theater.
Ooooh the tension in the air could be cut with a butter knife…it’s giving the uneasiness of The Invitation mixed with the forced poise/formality of Stepford Wives. Eerie! Can’t wait to see it!
Can I sell you a movie idea
But ITs a Little too late for u !
When the law doesnt apply!!
Nothing but tge truth! Blaming Simeone innocent!
The Stepford Wives
I can’t wait to see this movie!!!
Florence carried this whole scene phenomenally! And those stares from Chris, just chills! Those two are gonna carry the whole movie!! Hopefully the plot doesn't disappoint, I know the acting from Pugh and Pine will not though ;P
i am so scared of chris pines character💀
wow
Looks like Stepford Wives remake.
Why does everyone hate olivia
I’ve seen every trailer and I still don’t know what this movie is about, but I can’t wait to see it.✨
The Truman Show?
Chris Pine's acting in this scene is incredible. He's going to get an oscar nomination for best supporting actor.
I can clearly tell Chris Pine is gonna be a serious bugga and I can’t wait 😉 Thanks for sharing love😍❤️🙏🏾
Looks like heavily inspired by The Stepford Wives movies
gaslighting at its finest. The acting from everyone is crazy good.
Here for Kate Berlant! She's so good on par with Florence.
Did Chris Pine talk like Jordan Peterson here?
Harry who? Miss Flo FTW!!
Bro Florence Pugh is so hot
Gaslighting at its finest
The only darling that doesn't need to worry about a thing here is Florence Pugh. She is a gifted actor and delivered an outstanding performance as usual. But, Jordan Peterson depicted as a villain, really? That is preposterous and beyond comprehension.
Man. This really feels like a ✨*movie* ✨
Reminds me of invitation movie dinner scene
Ngl this movie looks so interesting even without all the drama
No worries. If you know something about me, I'll accept it
Can’t wait to see it 💚🧡💛💙
Okay you guys we get it you like Florence Pugh
She is so commanding I didn't even realize Harry Styles was in the scene. Not a dig at him, but she's damn talented.
Some of the trailers are reminding me of Get Out because the wives don’t seem to remember anything.
i love florence every movie is good
Florence Pugh better get an Oscar this upcoming 2023
Chris Pine and Florence Pugh, my two favorite actors 😊 Can't wait to see the full movie!
Usually when a movie releases too much in the trailer it's not good. I hope it's different for this movie.
I'm going for Harry Styles.
Fascinating premise...Florence Pugh :)
Horrible acting
Miss Flo is going to steal the show. 🍿🍿🍿  And that was only a 3 min vignette.
I want to see this soo so bad
BRO DINNER TABLE SCENES WILL FOREVER BE THE BEST😂😳👏🏾 like is all the dirty laundry aired at the gaddog dinner table bro never fails
this was the most genius trailer to put out because WHAT HAPPENED I NEED TO KNOW
I heard that Harry munches on Flo's rug.
Genuinely asking: is Harry supposed to be American sounding in this ? I haven’t seen it but I’m just wondering because he seems to be the only one with an accent in this, thank you:)
Harry messing up saying "what" in the the biggest british accent you'll ever hear 😂😂
Necesito traducción de esto
Hey, I'm from Philadelphia. But I would never be pretentious enough to say "pardon".
Always wondered what rich white people talk about at dinner....
Forget about the drama the scene had my mouth drop and it isn't the full movie florence acting and harry expressions  and Chris villainous look it so phenomenal can't wait to see this movie imagine if shia was in this movie i wonder how it will turn in
Harry is perfect in this movie 😘 and Florence and chris pine acting is amazing as usual 😄 can't wait to see this movie.
florence is a gem
This movie is getting review bombed so hard lmao
Lol, Pine is not based on Peterson at all,  judging by this clip.
i want to see this movie so badly
Ummm , is that HARRY STYLE ??
the fact that i’m going to college in philadelphia💀😳
This is so inspired by the true man show
Can't wait to see this. Huge Jordan Peterson fan. Not so much on Flo or Olivia but gonna watch nonetheless
Ok so the drama surrounding this is just chaotic, but honestly by this clip this would actually draw me in to see the film (and I usually wait when a movie hits theaters, I almost never go right away)
Agatha why are you doing here?!
This is a man hating movie go woke go broke…
Going to see Harry at MSG tonight!
THIS MOVIE LOOKS SO THRILLING IDK WHY PPL ARE HATING ON IT
Cannot wait to see this, shes a great actress
Interesting....Also, Chris Pine is only 42?..
BALTIMORE!!!!!!!
Florence Pugh is fantastic in Don’t Worry Darling!
i know they’re good actors but imagine memorizing all those lines, having the genuineness of butting in and making it seem like it’s the first time u said those sentences. Damn. This scene is soo good. 😳
Florence is so good.😮
I can't WAIT to see this!
I don't even watch movies like these, but this one clip makes me want to see the whole movie
I am really eager to watch this! Some incredible acting here.
Florence Pugh is just immense. Sensational actor
So tell us the entire movie - thanks
I know there was tension on set, but this looks SO GOOD!!
Is this movie just a remake of stepford wives?
Is this like a Truman show thing?😂
Ho looks nothing like Jordan Peterson!
Reminds me of Stepford Wives
Florence Pugh is magnificent!... it's sad that the story is like a feminist flyer with a cartoonish look on male opression... ohhh here comes the patriarchy... opressing all women... slaves of the male supremacy... we, the women, need to escape this male prison... omg.  i don't care about olivia wilde lying about firing Labeouf, i don't care about her romance with H. style... that doesn't matter... if the story wasn't a walking ignorant propaganda believe me i may like the film.. in fact i love "Booksmart" the O. Wilde's debut film... which surprisinly it's more mature than this.
This movie would make me lose my mind! I would be screaming "YES, YES TELL HE TRUTH"!
Big fan of Harry´s music but the sir is giving me nothing in this scene.
Florence and Chris slayed in this scene. Florence is the only reason why I will watch the film (including Chris )
She's giving "Your senile gramps having his moment "
Olivia is so dumb to burn this bridge with miss Flo.
Chris and Florence bringing their A GAME to the film!!
Very predictable film just off this scene she most likely will escape wherever they are at the end 🙄 lol and Harry's acting is trash props for trying tho 👏 he will only get better in time definitely not watching this film in theaters its not theater worthy at all
When can I watch this film online?
Like or not, this movie's CREDIBILITY has been SUNK even before its public release due to the neverending personal drama of its director & cast members. I wouldn't spend a single $ going to watch it like many others & certainly don't feel a loss whatsoever.
florence pugh is so magnetizing im about to cry
😐😶😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😐😐😐😐🤔😐🤔😐😐😐😐😶😬😶😐🤔😐🤔😐😐😐😶😐😶
im so excited this seems good
This scene just proves that Olivia Wilde plagiarized Stepford Wives. Way to show us you have no talent by having to literally rip off another story beat for beat. These actors were wasted on this production, so sad.
I’ve been intrigued since my first glimpse of this film. I’ll still watch it, despite the media circus.
That's the villainous Jordan Peterson, I mean Chris Pine, conspiring a complex system to control the minds of others! That's Jordan Peterson for you.  Nailed it...It makes you see how far off certain media representations of certain figures are from their actual ideas.  In fact, I'm pretty sure Olivia Wilde stayed as far as possible from contending with any of Jordan Peterson's actual thoughts or themes in his lectures.  It makes it easier to forgive her, since she clearly has no clue what Jordan Peterson actually has thought in any real sense.
I was looking for the *other* “dinner” scene, but this’ll do
Bugs was a struggling rapist all along ……… Warner brothers really claimed that 🤨🤨
Looks like a solid bore. Very hard pass.
🤟.......#❤❤❤❤❤
This scene makes me like Jordan Peterson even more!!!
Saw this on an ad watched the whole thing lead me here
I really hope this movie doesn’t flop and it’s good as it looks. Florence is going to need to go to the hospital for back by carrying this movie
miss flo opposite of chris pine is the saving grace of this movie
If this becomes available on VidAngel I’ll watch it 😂
Isn't it obvious that if everyone has basically the same life story, that it wouldn't exactly remain a secret? Why do they seem surprised that she discovered all the similarities? Looks kinda dumb to me
Miss Flo and Chris Pine’s chemistry is just so fineeee
God this is great
florence and chris are the only good actors in this...i’m watching for florence
Ok this looks great. I don't know why there is such mixed reviews
This film feels like a recreation of The Stepford Wives
Damn. Florence and Chris killed this scene!
I am sick 😷 of people who hype this just because Harry….Florence deserves much more♥️…..she is the best and we all know it. SHE IS GORGEOUS ♾
Looks terrible.
Harry's character is supposed to be american?? After the "oppohtoohneety"  clip I thought he was british on the film
What an incredible performance from Florence she is an absolute powerhouse, I’ll definitely be going to see this movie, only for her performance
this scene feels relatable somehow!
excited for this. Dont care about all the drama, the plot of the movie sounds fascinating! also I need someone to find out where her earrings are from
This seems like a remake of The Stepford Wives.
Just upload the whole movie
the tension between harry and florence, their problems within the film are going to worsen by the end and im here for it
Love Harry's performance in this!
Movie name
0:22 0:46 Chris made me so anxious in this scene. It just made me want to shut up Flo to protect her cuz she's gonna get hurt. I think Chris did an outstanding none verbal acting here.
Florence Pugh right now kills it whatever role she is in
disneyyyyyyyy
This feels like a movie!
That was really unsettling and I loved it.
dude, i was laughing about the drama bcos wtf was even going on at venice ??! 💀 but bro… this clip ?! now i am INVESTED
is this actually how the music is in the movie? cause it's so overbearing
Florence is too good for this movie.
Seriously I am so waiting for this movie......
Looks good.  Can't wait to see it.
Harry styles is a zero...🤮
Harry Styles spat in all of their drinks, didn’t he?
Florence what an amazing actress. Her facial expression always on point.
Its giving me Get Out vibes
I’m so excited to watchThe movie, I don’t care about the drama and hate that go around this movie
Eff Olivia!
If you watch it don’t watch it in theatres pirate it instead as the director deserves no profit off this
Trying to figure out what harry styles' accent is supposed to be in this movie, is he english, is he american, something in between?
Olivia Wilde is crazy like batshit crazy.
okay this scene gave me a little hope that the movie won’t be too too bad
I feel like I'm watching Wandavision right now
Nothing against the acting at all. But the editing is not great, keep an eye on Harry for each transaction (when he’s in shot). His hand placement and facial expression change so the continuity is so off.   Just to clarify, this has nothing to do with Harry, in fact I thought the small acting we get to see from him in this scene seems good, it’s just a big issue with the editing 😬
it looks really good but i'm just going to wait for it online for free
Whoa Miss Flo! This whole scene was amazing. The music was spine chilling. I’m excited to see this.
Florence is the saving grace of this movie
Can`t wait to see the film
Going to go for Florence and Chris pine . May even go in a “miss flo “ shirt . LOVE MY GIRL and she is the only reason I’d go see it
Chris Pine and Florence gonna EAT!
It sure does feel like a movie
the scoring of this scene alone is already giving me goosebumps, i'm so excited to watch this!!!
This is so funny that Olivia thinks it’s Jordan Peterson 🤣 😂👍🏼
Whatever Happened To Olivia Wildest?
The humming at 2:18 !!!
Harry is just not good at acting is he?
Isn’t every good director messy? Lmfao
chris pine acts so well with just his eyes
...   ..This skeched artist organised with her friends terracts: Trade Center Pentagon 2011, Tsunami 2004, MS Estonia 1994, terracts in metro Moscow 2010, corona virus in 2019. They did it for stealing digital copies of royals bodies and digital copy of my body for financing their own terrorists group. Never publish these artists or you will be considered as sponsor of  terrorism....
this scene didn't need any music at all. it took me out for a bit. but nonetheless it was gripping
his ‘do you?’ 🧎🏻‍♀️
Can't wait to watch it!! So excited!!
So let me guess: possible spoiler for this  movie - I don't know I'm just guessing.  It's all a simulation. Everyone is actually plugged in like in "The Matrix". And only the simulation takes place in the 50s, but the reality is set in today's time. And the men wanted  to do this so they could control their wives in the simulation. Well I'm gonna find out soon if I'm right. But the trailer made it kinda obvious.
Hyped !!
I think I’ll pass (despite Florence being brilliant). The idea of watching the character trying to question the lies around her and being gaslit over and over and over again is not my idea of fun. And with the end being what it is, it doesn’t sound like a rewarding experience at all.
I know Florence, Chris and Gemma are gonna be great in this!
So excited for Harry!!!
I'm so amazed by Harry's acting. With so little time here,his facial expressions are able to portray the emotions totally! So excited for him!!!
Thats actually Chris' expression behind the scene with the dramas and controversies lmao.
This should have been the trailer.
Is that harry styles at the dinner table??
MISS FLO ATE AND LEFT NO CRUMBS EITHER
This clip reveals too much. Now I know it’s about erasing their memory so they have this picture perfect story in their head. That isn’t true.   Before I didn’t know exactly What the intrigue was. Now I do. That’s too revealing of a clip to use 😭
Harry wrote and produced the trigger song of the movie in 5 minutes, he's so talented
Going to watch for harry ❤
Chris pine looks good …I wonder what is his facial skin and exercise routine routine
Florence Pugh is HOT HOT HOT -- this looks amazing :)
I love the emphasis and skill in which Florence Pugh says her lines
I just love her voice 😍
im speechless. i havent been so excited for a movie for so long. been waiting since harry was announced that he is casted for dwd! im so glad i get to see it for my 18th bday!!
This is gonna be a damn good movie
It looks so good
the tension in this scene… AMAZING
this sounds like an awesome movie
Mehh 🤧
I'm so friggin excited for the entire storyline and... Florence Pugh too
This looks awesome, I love psychological thrillers
Miss flo shines in the scene . A force! They probably should of invest in a accent coach for Harry bc is he American or British in this movie ?
QUEEN FLO SLAYS EVERY TIME
the acting just from this is phenomenal i can't wait to see florence performance
I luv harry styles and I can't wait to watch this on my birthday🥳
Harry🖤 Someone has to talk abt him!
Despite  all  the bad gossip I still really want to see this.
The cast of shutter Island would have been perfect for this movie
i am SO EXCITED
Omg the way harry looked at Florence when she says "I didn't even finish yet" ...it gave me goosebumps 😍🔥🔥
Harry <3
Everyone looks so "fake" - 2020's filtered through 1950's, weird and unreal.
Flo MY GOODNESS the acting👌🤌✨
Florence absolutely rocked this. And I dont want to take away her spotlight or anything because we all know she brought her a game and not many can even match it on a good day. But for all the comments saying harry can't act, I just want to say that even with the tiny scenes we get from him in this movie (from the teasers/sneak peaks/trailers) like this one, that is bull. His facial expressions and the way he conveys this character is so good. And if people say that I am blinded from my love for him, I will admit I stan and adore harry and I would do anything to see him smile or be happy, but that doesn't make me blind.
Stepford Wife adjacent. Been done.
Florence Pugh and Chris Pine are totally worth the second look. They are incredible.
I’m f*ckin’ psyched.
Wait what is this thing about?
Did not expect the kind of critical reaction this film has gotten. I was sold from the first trailer, and this scene looks just as good. So curious to see how it falters.
This is a great clip. Florence is killing it as always and it's cool seeing Chris as a villain. Excited and hope this lives up to what the quality of the clips and trailers.
Florence and Chris really killing it in this scene! Not an Olivia Wilde fan but I’ll watch o support these two amazing actors
I know it’s only one scene, but it’s really good. The acting, direction, camera work, and editing all look solid.
Don't care if it's bad, I'm going to watch it just for Florence <3
OMG
FLORENCE. PUGH.
is this movie based on another movie or tv show?? because I swear, everything about this is so familiar, like I've seen this story somewhere else
Sorry WB, this looks like another dud.
1:37 there’s an inconsistency with Flos hand placement... but this looks SOO good otherwise
This is actually a pretty great scene.  I'm impressed.
Oooo!  This is a story about the Democrats!  Making people mis-remember, rewriting their view of reality, instilling cognitive dissonance.  Yep, this will be terrifying.
I hope that WB put extra care and supplied a rich budget for this.  The period architecture, clothing, Ave art should be fantastic.  I'm looking forward to watching a bootleg blu-ray.  I hope it's as bad for them as "Rings of Power" has been for Amazon.  (I actually just came here to find out about Velma becoming a vigilante, and "disappearing" villains.)
Still can't understand what this movie is about!🤯
no matter how hard you try this is a bad movie
At this point I really don’t know which looks better, DWD or MP. Such good actors, such good characters. I can’t wait to watch!!!
Shes done some amount of promo for this, I hope its worth all the hype. Are her & Harry still together?
All the drama aside, the movies just a cliche.
Harry Styles KING 🙌
i'm interest  by this movie but i don't want to pay for something did by Olivia  and  for people who saw it the stepford wives or nothing to do with it
WE GOT ANOTHER CHEWING FOOD SCENE 💀 DUNKIRK BREAD SCENE 2.0
Awww she’s getting it. Smart girl
it's like a movie
Despite all the dramas and the reviews, this scene alone is just amazing. Only if everything were smooth and went well (imagine nothing happened) from the beginning, I really wish to see Shia's acting in this whole movie, alongside with amazing Florence and Chris. But it is what is it now...
See..the dinner is without light to symbolize they re all in the dark
Never mind the controversy behind the scenes, but I for one am interested in seeing this. Florence Pugh has a gift. And she is not wasting it.
so whats the twist?
I would have to see the whole movie but based on this scene alone, I'm not seeing why it's getting all this vitrolic hatred, Florence Pugh is Killing it like always, It's well shot, well edited ramps up that uneasy feeling the more she keeps going, and of course you have Chris Pine clearly having fun playing the charming villain. Even Harry Styles doesn't seem terrible in this clip. It's clearly a real two hander between Pine and Pugh but Styles still has some great facial acting in this clip. Still excited to this see this.
I feel like this is a bit of a spoiler clip? Not sure what's left to see in this film to be honest, think we have seen the best bits and plot twists in the 10 trailers we have been given
Damn her acting
Florence looks to be incredible. Can’t wait to see this!
Whoa, the tension is crazy!!!
Chris Pine giving off strong Leo Dicaprio vibes with his villainous smile here
The framing and overall directing of at least this clip isnt very good. The characters are off center or there are objects behind them that are distracting.
Why are people saying this is a bad movie?! Just by this scene I’m so drawn to it!
Hmmmm let’s see how this movie goes
this actually looks so good
It sounds weird hearing Florence Pugh with an American accent.
Ya me ví la película de puros trailers q sacan tlv
I CAN'T WAIT
loool omg harry styles cannot act that accent is so embarassing lolol
Ooooh Myyy God can't wait 😳😭😭
I am so excited for that movie coming out!
This looks actually really intriguing. When will it be available on HBO max?
JACK IS INNOCENT
FLORENCE YOU QUEEN!
Omg!!!!! Oh my goodness… I am literally speechless… I was soooooo invested into what was going on I forgot that it was just a clip on YouTube!! Like I am sooo excited to see this!!
lmao why is WB posting this entire movie  btw this and all the trailers we’ve seen 50% of it already
I hope Florence rested her back after filming this scene cause she carried HEAVILY (but big rep to Chris too cause damn he's amazing)
I love her character already lol she got some big 🏀 ⚽️ 🏈
Florence is amazing in this scene
👍
👍
Bello Harry solo por ti voy a verla
Ya suelten las 3 escenas que faltan para terminar de verla completa, ya me eche la pelicula en puro trailer😴
So this is the movie based of the very evil man, Jordan Peterson 🤣🤣 Hollywood is pathetic. How do they know what a woman is? I thought only biologists can tell. And why isn’t harry wearing a dress?
Another trailor, at this point ive seen the whole movie
This really proves that Florence Pugh can work off a piece of blank paper
The concept sounds cool, it just reminds me of the stepford wives I hope that there aren't too many similarities.
Hollywood do love their British actors, but this clip is already too creepy and disturbing for my taste
Is that harry
It looks wonderful.
Flo is a slay
Not a spoilery clip at all. It was great. Just a hint of things to come.  Makes  me want to go see it. Every movie has a lot of clips. Stop dumping on it. Looks like it’s going to be a good movie. Fun thriller.
This looks so good tho
chillls
Wait Harry styles (eros), black widow, wonderwomans crush, and that guy from loki all at one dinner table?
Very smart of Warner Bros to upload one of the key scenes of the movie lol
I want to see this but damn does it sound like nobody had a good time filming it. So I feel bad but this is intriguing. Olivia Wilde may be a liar or snake or not but this story is fascinating.
Where's Jordan Peterson!?
this reminded me of the iconic dinner scene from greys anatomy "perfect penny killed my husband"
Omfg
ooooooh
Woke Trash
Stepford
harry, G T F O of acting buddy. it's for ur own good. you can't deliver the simplest dialogue normally
At this rate I'll end up watching the full movie
Jordan Peterson is such a great hero in this movie.
So this is like a stepford wives kind of film? All the women are programmed the same
Lmfao they are desperate to hype this movie after the Venice Film festival dragged them through the mud.
Harry styles damnnnnnnnn😍😍😍😍😫
Florence is just an amazing actress!
no entiendo nada jaj
Florence could act opposite of nothing and she'd still kill it
nmmn, ya me vi la película completa con todos los spoilers qué se avientan 😴
Chris Pine seem like the right guy as Reed Richard aka Mr. Fantastic
WHAT
this makes me believe in myself. the bad press against olivia wild is completely purposeful. these women are GENIUS and barely anyone can see the TRUTH
After 4281 trailers and god knows how many snippets, just add the end credits and we have been watching the whole movie my now. What kind of promotion needs to leaks it's own movie like this and expect people to pay for stuff they already have seen for free.
Florence is awesome!!!!😍🤩😍😎😎😎
Middle east, china, Russia etc... about to ban this movie. Warner Bros will be mad 😂
Meh. I'll wait for streaming.
Ya que saquen toda la pinche película mejor
Gonna be flop! I highly doubt this movie gonna make more then batman in term of box office lmao 😂
Florence always rocks her accents ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Its wasn't all soo spoilery
