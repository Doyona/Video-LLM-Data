luke kennard got scammed he made his 2nd mowntai dew ball and they didnt count it in the 1st round
I’m sorry to hear that unfortunately for Luke Kennard’s sake all lefties go to hell
Bro everyone says curry is a legend for getting 29 in the 2021 three point contest and they should look at KAT
can anyone tell me the name of the song that is playing in the background
what is the background music?
0/8
Why did Trae young shoot that last 3 like that
Prizepicks brought me here 😂
"Curry revolutionized the game with his 3P%, making long-range shots a vital strategy."

Why Stephen Curry isn't there?
Congratulations to KAT for winning the three point contest 🎉

If curry was in the 3 point contest it would have been a Ez 30
Steph had left the chatt 🙁
I thought Trae young would win💀
I wish to see Westbrick and Freeloader Ben in 3pts contest
Где степен карри
Softest centers in the league can shoot, but its a shame to call him a big man

There's actually a video of KAT asking tips from Curry before he stepped out for this contest. That's awesome
Good job KAT, still wondering why Steph wasn’t in this one, he basically invented the three point contest
Kat's Just insane
Wow Kat won?!
Why didn't curry participate tho?
Trae young should be on next 3 point contest. He definitely gonna win
But no curry
If only curry was in this
Karl is incredibly underrated
Steph and klay beating this guys all day
Trae young has some bad luck in this contest he’ll get one soon though
Bro 2015 ain’t happenin again, just put the three point contest last instead of the dunk contest damn
he said im the best big man who won the 3 points shot contest?! he is not even the best for this in minnesota...  kevin love won it before!!

2 questions What does the dew ball give you ?  Why doesn’t curry participate in this event ? is it cuz it would be too unfair or something?
KARL ANTONY TOWNS CENTER? WAOWW !!!!!
What are the odds a center would win a 3 pt contest? Thats impressive by kat
They didn’t count the Mountain Dew ball (three points) for Luke Kennard in the first round
Congrats Towns! My favorite player really knocking them threes down!
Love the 3pt contest but I’ve noticed they are a little lazy with the scoring like this year they didn’t count like kenards mtn dew ball and last year they basically gave mike Conley an extra money rack
Kat Shoutout
Bruh if curry or luka played this they would shit on him
Where is curry
Dancing
A big man wining is op

Idk about this event but why Curry is not here?

Where was curry
The NBA is woke garbage now. The 90s were the best days.
Hello
Bunch of show-off wa*k*r*.
1:59 if he was black they would be screaming racism. He had 14 before shooting the money 3 ball and they didn't put points on it
KAT💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥

Curry would of won. If he was playing

Respect to towns, but dude needs to stop claiming he’s the greatest shooting big man of all time.
Dear NBA please review the Rip through foul its cheap, easy, petty, ect. Stop bailout players with this Rip Through foul    make them earn it
Congrats KAT, a big man winning the 3 pt contest that's fantastic!! Multi-purposed player right there!
Curry unreal
This was a good 3pt contest but I mean there was better I liked seeing patty mills because he not as big as a star but I rlly like seeing Kat winning

KAT - 3:55 At the first round 5:17 At the final round 8:50 opponent's failed last chance at Hail Mary and post-game interview
They didn't count Kennard's three point ball
Trae young is the best💪

Big man winning this is a major shift for the league congrats KAT 🏆
Cmon now trae we ain’t gonna let a center win thi Shii bro

Why was Steph Curry not participating this year?
#freenightfoxx
If CJ was still in Portland he would’ve been motivated enough to win lol shout out New Orleans though Mardi Gras coming up
Dude nba messed up big time with not putting Stephen curry in there, he just broke the three point record and they put CJ Macollum instead of curry. Man they really messed up this year
Am I trippin or did they not count Luke Kennard's MTN Dew Ball?

Stephen Curry versus Klay Thompson versus Ray Allen versus Reggie Miller versus Steve Kerr every year all day Three-Point contest f*** these kids are playing  Y so serious 😈🃏🥃
Self proclaimed congrats..
Cj McCollum got a glitch release 😂😂
Desmond bane did not go
Like kennard's release is a left handed curry
Successful people don't become that way over  night.What most people see at a glance-weath, a great career, purpose- Is the results of hard work and hustle over time.I pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life..
Good job NBA players You really work your hardest
They should name the 3 pt champion the Steph Curry Trophy
Put legends from diff. Leagues as guest?

Impressive big man shooting
KAT sound like he’s related to Drake
i literally burst a laugh when i heard Kat joining the 3pt contest. And now im a fan of him 🙂☠️
Kat got a free point on his first rack
Announcers talking in the background ruin it.  just let him shoot
Trae young isn't as good as he should be.
Curry win the 3-point contest this year... only by playing in the All-star game. Lol
I saw kat in there I was like why tf they put a C in there. Then I saw this man almost reach 30. Jesus im mad he aint reach 30

My Boy KAT Shining After Countless Loses Love To See It🔥
Kat congrats bro
curryyyyyyy o mestre !! 👏👏👏👏
🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴⚡👊🏻
I have figured out a solution to improve the all star weekend.  First, remove the slam dunk contest from Saturday night and expand the 3 point contest. Add more contestants with more rounds. And to be honest, more shooters would be better. 18, 24, 32!!!! Whatever!!! It would be dope!!!! Secondly, we always want the stars to compete in the dunk contest. Why not have a online-real time voting on the dunks in the all star game!!! So Sunday would be awarded to the all star game winner, all star game mvp and the all star dunk champion!!!!! What do people think about this idea!!??!! Please comment. Let’s make this happen!!!

luke kennards mtn dew ball didn’t count first round
The great 3 point shooters didn’t even participate 😂😂
Obviously you will lose if someone outshoots you in this shooting contest……..good thing you found basketball….I bet the ball found you though. You were probably chasing butterflies when the ball hit you in the back of your head, and you said hmm did the butterfly drop this? Yous about a goofy ass dude.
Trae is overrated as a shooter
@v
🐯🎯
Zmoz
Greed
KAT showed SHAQ how it’s done!
These competitions felt different in the 80s - just like most things
Can we start calling it the Stephen Curry 3 pt trophy now please.
How come Curry didn’t participate?
Steph had 16 3s in an all star game and a better % then these guys had wide open in a 3 point contest thats crazy
Karl was the highlight of the allstar break.  He should have been a starter but  theres a lot of people blinded by their hate out here
KAT's shots make a nice, crisp sound.
3 points contest this year is kinda lacking without steph and the others
anyone else think patty mills looks like gary trent jr's twin brother?
The true shooter KAT
BUENA PARA LA REPUBLICA DOMINICANA GRACIAS KARL ANTHONY TOWNS POR REPRESENTAR EL PAIS Y LLEVARTE ESE PREMIO DEL 3 POINTS CONTEST HORGULLOSO DE COMPARTIR PAIS CON  KARL ANTHONY TOWNS 🇩🇴
Por medio de Cristo, Dios perdona los pecados y hace las paces con todos
This was the worst 3 point contest I’ve ever seen. Literally no one in this contest have no business being in this contest except maybe for Luke. The fact that a bum shooter like KAT won this contest says a lot.
Damn, CJ McCollum lost

Scorpio shit ♏
KAT got that range but to say that he is the best shooting big man ever? not yet KAT. Dirk still at the top.
We missed Steph 😭
Did some of you that play ball just watch this and be like “how the fuck do you miss more than me?”
This contest is way MORE EXCITING THAN borefest dunk contest 🙄
Trae my fav
Why not put the money balls at the top of the key the easiest shot instead of the last rack when u tired lol that’s why KAT out smarted everyone
It’s awesome to see KAT is like universally loved. dude is an amazing person and a great player, not a timberwolves fans but I always love seeing highlights of him and watching him play sometimes. So dope he won it this year
3:23- announcer: he got a title from that spurs team. Wade: we don’t have to talk about the title, it’s a good weekend 😂  (in 2014 the spurs 4-1 the heat)
Kat turned on aimbit
Best shooting big man
Yooo how Kat won
Amazing 👍

NBA: “FULL nba 3pt contest”  also NBA: except bane, lavine, and vanvleet ❤️
Where is curry
You forgot Desmond Bane
Congrats Kat!!!!
Way to light it up big Kat!!!!
I think the NBA should let Drake enter the NBA 3 point contest for being a great NBA ambassador for the past decade. Just to see what he got, and Jay-Z as well.
No Larry Bird! Lol!
https://youtu.be/FpwCot14tBU
You should add a 3pt contest but have some of the worst 3pt shooters.
Why didn’t curry participate
Where's curry?
Congrats KAT winning this year 3pt contest 🏆 gotta give him a big around of applauds 👏😁
I hope Klay would come back here and participate.

😞Hi: Unfortunately I can not speak English, so I have to use the program I have installed on my phone for translation, except that I can speak Persian, I do not speak any language other than Persian and no other language. I can not speak, so if I said words or sentences and the special program mistranslated into your language, I apologize in advance to your esteemed father, from the bottom of my heart and from the bottom of my heart, that the letters and words Call me to the end and call me a person orDo not consider me a rude person and do not consider me a rude person and judge me correctly and after reading my writings, just put yourself in my place for a few minutes and imagine yourself in my place, maybe if you have an awakened conscience and There was love and affection in your hearts, of course, if you did not have pride and arrogance, understand me and give me the right, and again, maybe, maybe, maybe you did something and you did it for me and you took me from You saved this great tribulation that I hope will not happen to any living thing, of courseI do not very much hope that anyone will take my hand and save me from this misfortune, but I am writing so that I can at least be comfortable in front of my conscience and not blame myself later if I cry out for this cruelty, oppression, and captivity that has fallen on me. All the doors are closed to me, even the eyes of God are blind to see the oppression that is being done to me, and the ears of God are blind to hearing the cries of my constant cries, my midnight cries, my daily sufferings, my daily prayers and the jurists and The cries of my every moment from this oppression, oppression and cruelty that from the beginning of my life, fromThe first events of my life that I remember are deaf. So how can I hope for others when God has done nothing for me and trapped me in a cruel, cruel, cruel, and oppressive family? I am Morteza, I am from Iran, I am blind, I am 34 years old, I am unemployed because in our country, Iran, there is no work for healthy people, let alone disabled people like me. I live with my family in a small town in Iran. Of course, in appearance, they are my family, but in reality, they see me as their own enemy, and with me, who am their child, only bI was born blind, and I was not to blame for this, but my parents, because they were illiterate, considered me as a disgrace only to myself for my blindness and disability, and were always tortured as severely as possible. They beat me to the point where they threatened me with a knife. They put me to sleep and put the knife on my neck, and I was terrified and scared. Get up and until fullThe thin skin of my hand burned, they would not let me go. And they tortured me many, many times, to the point that my brothers, with the support of my parents, tortured me in front of my parents' indifferent eyes, and told me that I was blind. You are and you should be tortured to the extent that they created the belief in me and in my mind that anyone who is blind or disabled should be tortured because it is a disgrace to the family and society. And unfortunately, their torture is still going on, and only a kind of tortureThey do not consider it for him, so how can I complain to someone who considers my law as his property, of course, the current laws in Iran. Unfortunately, the government does not have a place for people like me to go and live. I really have no choice, either I have to commit suicide or I have to stay in the same house that my family has turned into hell for me, under the severe mental and physical torture that my family inflicts on me. And more than ever with a horrible gradual death that tormentedI want to stay. So if you still have a little mercy, fairness, conscience, compassion, love, humanity, knowledge, ideology, humanity and altruism, help me, hold my hand, reach my cry. If you are in contact with institutions and organizations affiliated with the International Committee of the Red Cross, or if any of you are a member of human rights organizations or the International Committee of the Red Cross or Red Cross organizations in free and pro-human rights countries, listen to my writings, my voice and my cry. Come on, maybe they're a little fair and think of me and a way toSave me from the clutches of ostensibly wolves, of course, if human rights institutions and organizations and the Red Cross actually support human rights, if you are a citizen of a free country or a citizen of a free country like the United States, Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Norway, You have Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the European Union. Send me invitations, arrange for me to leave this house, which is worse than hell, so that maybe I too can taste freedom. If you have capital, you are rich, you have money, at least help meLeave the messengers, so that all the photos on my personal pages in the messengers and social networks are from 8 years ago, that is, for 8 years ago and 5 years ago. I have not even traveled for many years, because our city is a small city. It is sad for a disabled person to leave home, it is sad for a disabled person, the streets of our city are not adapted so that a disabled person can easily be at least a little out of home. And I'm really depressed at home, especially with this family that is always torturingAre. Of course, I do not care if I travel or not, because my problems are so great that not traveling travels much more than my other or other problems. In your opinion, can a person who eats only one meal in 48 hours, which is a good meal, even a moderate meal, but also any garbage he gets, take pictures, travel or not, and other things? Slowly, someone who breaks his heart at every moment, of course, the work of my heart is no longer broken and my heart is on fire andIt is burned, and this fire is getting more and more hot and burning, and it is burning and ashes my whole being. So I hope that if you do not hear the sound of my heart breaking, at least be fair and feel the smell of my heart burning, away from arrogance, arrogance, misguidedness, ethnicity, race, skin color, shape and appearance for the sake of humanity and for Humanity and honor that you have, just imagine yourself in my place for a few minutes, see yourself in my place and think, if far away from you, God forbid, you would be in my place.Did you ??? Were you satisfied that someone was making fun of you or disrespecting you, or did you laugh at you in response to your message and pain and heart ?, so my dear friends and those who wrote my writings to you Please, if you do not want to do anything for me, at least do not make fun of me, do not laugh, and if you do not want to help extinguish the fire inside me that burns my heart, at least do not spill oil and gasoline with ill-considered language, words and expressions, and this is far from knowledge, honor, It is humanity and family originality. If you want to give me anyPlease help me do not send me a message on YouTube because I can not transfer messages from YouTube to the translation program that I have installed on my phone, and as a result, because I am not fluent in any language other than Persian, I can not understand the meaning of messages.

The World's Funniest One Liners ever!  1. Borrow money from a pessimist -- they don't expect it back. 2. For every action there is an equal and opposite criticism. 3. No one is listening until you make a mistake.   4. Eschew obfuscation. 5. I started out with nothing and I still have most of it. 6. A day without sunshine is like, night. 7. Okay, who stopped the payment on my reality check?  8. Diplomacy is the art of letting someone else get your way. 9. I've only been wrong once, and that's when I thought I was wrong.   10. I didn't use to finish sentences, but now I    Perhaps the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

Two 26's and a 29 for the final round is incredibly tough, shooters shoot
Hindi Kasi natutukan Ng media masyado c Towns sa accurate shooting nito deserve nya respetuhin
Exactly what he needed
Congratulations KAT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUBmxB1Y7Y4 bruh lol this ridiculous
Curry changed the game
I can't believe the chief didn't pick he would of won anyways
I uploaded Curry's 50 points and 16 3-pointers! Best Highlights from all star game team lebron vs team durant. Check it out 🥺🥺🙏
imagine westbrook play
The Kat hits it outside of the bags-room!  Cool.
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins, Repent of what the New Testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel obey the teachings of Jesus documented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, be baptized by faith in Jesus you can live life with him as your example. If you need prayer i'll pray for you. If you want to keep contact with a brother in Christ i’ll keep contact with you. The love of God is beyond our understanding. God bless.

Mensaje para todo el Mundo MUY IMPORTANTE (de la luz divina): 1 pág./2021 (Apoca.21 8Pero los cobardes e incrédulos, los abominables y homicidas, los fornicarios y hechiceros, los idólatras y todos los mentirosos tendrán su parte en el lago que arde con fuego y azufre, que es la muerte segunda.) Introducción: descubre la VERDAD DE la Luz: .. -ateísmo: a) dice que es irracional decir que Dios existe, por falta de evidencias; pero entonces como no hay evidencias tampoco que Demuestren que Dios NO EXISTE: también sería irracional decir que Dios no existe. (Pensar puedes pensarlo, pero afirmarlo sería irracional) Según ellos.. los ateos. b) Por otro lado: nadie que buscó a Dios, Dios no le habló: o no le dio algún milagro para que crea sin problemas hasta la MUERTE. La realidad es la siguiente: ROMANOS 1:20 Porque las cosas invisibles de él, su eterno poder y deidad, se hacen claramente visibles desde la creación del mundo, siendo entendidas por medio de las cosas hechas, de modo que no tienen excusa. -Catolicismo: dicen que cuando se arrodilla ante estatuas e imágenes y les besa los pies y los venera como algo sagrado: NO LOS ESTAN ADORANDO.. pero: EL DICCIONARIO dice que ADORAR ES LO SIGUIENTE: << 1. tr. Reverenciar o rendir culto a un ser que se considera de naturaleza divina. 2. tr. Dicho de un cardenal: Postrarse delante del papa después de haberlo elegido en señal de reconocerlo como legítimo sucesor de san Pedro. 3. tr. Amar con extremo. 4. tr. Gustar de algo extremadamente. 5. intr. orar (‖ dirigirse a una divinidad). 6. intr. Tener puesta la estima o veneración en una persona o cosa. ..<< b) CUANDO preguntas a un Protestante o CRISTIANO: cuando esta de rodillas ante el altar y el pastor orando por él: ¿que a quién dedica ese arrodillamiento, o ese postramiento, sí para el pastor o para Dios? SIEMPRE RESPONDERÁ que para solamente: Dios.. en cambio los católicos al arrodillarse ante santos, responderán que dedican ese arrodillamiento y postramiento para esos santos estatuas imágenes etc.! (Esa es la diferencia..!!) -Religión los testigos de Jehova (ósea Dios): a) La trinidad claro que existe: Isaías 9:6 dice: "6 Porque un niño nos es nacido, hijo nos es dado, y el principado sobre su hombro; y se llamará su nombre Admirable, Consejero, Dios Fuerte, (con "D" MAYÚSCULA; para comprobarlo buscar diccionarios google traductor etc. en internet o en libros o etc.) Padre Eterno, Príncipe de Paz." b) Claro que se que existe infierno, porque: Mateo 13 36 Entonces, despedida la gente, entró Jesús en la casa; y acercándose a él sus discípulos, le dijeron: Explícanos la parábola de la cizaña del campo. (Va a decir una EXPLICACIÓN NO UNA SIMBOLOGÍA o una otra parábola de la parábola de la cizaña del campo..) 41 Enviará el Hijo del Hombre a sus ángeles, y recogerán de su reino a todos los que sirven de tropiezo, y a los que hacen iniquidad, 42 y los echarán en el horno de fuego; allí será el lloro y el crujir de dientes. (Esto ES LA EXPLICACIÓN/ NO UN MITO, O PARÁBOLA..) (entiemposapocalipticos.blogspot.com).. :)

Kat and Shaq don't like each other?
I guess Steph Curry wanted a all star game MVP  trophy and all star game 3 -pt record instead of winning this event  this year
https://youtu.be/dtdXC7AOBt8
https://youtu.be/dtdXC7AOBt8
https://youtu.be/1yfyxqvSG_M
How come no Steph and klay
https://youtu.be/gzdS4fj1bL4
I am so happy for KAT, that dude is going to enter his prime and is already an all time big ! So much respect man !
Why does the 3pt Contest more entertaining than the Dunk Contest this year?  Congrats to KAT btw 🏆
https://youtu.be/GHIMASbscXA
A big man winning 3 pt contest?!! Steph man you changed the game!
At least, D-Wade stuck to his guns with his pick of KAT. Nobody expected him to do what he did in this event
https://youtu.be/Xo3LKy6sBjM
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
State Farm don made billions off this one video
Kat definitely killed this but I was a lil disappointed no Steph Curry. But he made up for it tonight with the 50 piece
More commercials please you communists lover dirt bags 🤡🥳🤯
About Karl Anthony-Towns 6:36 "wanted to be known as the best big man shooter" of the NBA..  Maybe he can have the current bragging rights.. now that there's no Nowitzki and Stojakovic and Larry Bird.
Karl Anthony towns is NOT Smug,  arrogant or full of himself. He seems like a confident player and he’s committed to becoming what he believes he is and like that. I like that he’s trying to prove he’s the best shooting big man. I can’t hate on him for that   Do I think he’s is???? Hell no , but he think he is and that’s good enough for him, and I’m happy for him
Ice trae purposely missed that last money ball...
Dirk is the best big man shooter of all time
The 3-pointer is now the new dunk. For the longest everyone wanted to be like Mike flying in the air and dunking. But now everyone wants to be like Steph just jacking up 3’s.
Where’s curry?
Shaq should join.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life5

Karl antoni towns ....💪💪💪...República Dominicana💪💪
Two 26's and a 29 for the final round is incredibly tough, shooters shoot
Jidion would be proud of KAT🤣
KAT deserves all this respect. Being a big man in the 3pt contest is the future

Lol, Calm down Kat .... Dirks won the 3pt contest.... Dirks so much a better shooter than you. Stop being disrespectful.
KAT has such a weird shooting form
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFtyLzkH1tM&list=PL1k8ELq8gcF2r4OcBiqor3krDiwvazGEr&index=6&t=51s
I can’t tell the difference between this being an actual game or real life. Smh
Dirk nowitzki will always be best shooter ...
*GAY thumbnail*
They should've let Saddiq Bey participate in the 3pt contest.  He'd've won lol
Bruh where was Curry and Klay?
Beautiful 3-point shootout. He has a nice stroke for a big man
Kat deserves this fo sho
best part of saturday all-star weekend
Muito top 🥇🏅🎖😁😄🏆🏀.
THERE ARE NO ALIENS; RAPTURE  |  02/22/2022  THE RAPTURE WILL OCCUR ON FEBRUARY 21/22, 2022, AD, THE YEAR OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. CHILDREN WILL DISAPPEAR AND THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL WILL BE PREACHED TO ALL NATIONS.  DO NOT TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST OR ITS HELL.
imagine losing to a center
So they add 2 more money balls and they still talk about 30 being a BIG score?
Ty had em
Where was curry lmao
🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
wheres Curry?
I am so happy for KAT, that dude is going to enter his prime and is already an all time big ! So much respect man !
Full? WTF NBA LOL
https://youtu.be/Mo5lnyPsFVA
Yow shooting has taken over dunking damn
Shoutout KAT
🔥🔥🔥
Goat 🐐
GG to Kat but no Steph and no Klay this year... Important to keep into account
Just shows the league BEST shooters didn’t participate. Letting a big man win a shooting contest. IN THE NBA IS CRAZY
Light 20?
Wow
🇩🇴🇩🇴👏👏
I can't believe they have the refs there to look and do the stupid 3 and good motion.
Wow didn’t expect Kat to win I was hoping either trae or Luke kenard
Wala si curry kung kasali dyan yon champion na naman sigurado hahaah
Why curry is not allowed?
Congrats to KAT for this Big win but Steph and Klay took it personnal
Congrats Karl
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭ Jesus Christ loves us all and only wants the best for us❤️🙏✝️ May God bless you
Trash.
Trae should of won
wheres steph carry?
Time to bring the splash bros 🔙
Love KAT and happy for him, but let's be real, Ben Simmons would have this win in the bag
If the SPLASH BROS 💦 were in this none of these boys would’ve had a chance.
McCollum sucked
clippers are fuckin cursed even on the all star weekend
ALL TIME MY ASS. STFU GAY MOVING BIG MAN.
This was fun to watch, thanks for the upload, and gotta love Big KAT with the win!
good news to tell
Chef Curry wasn't in it?!
The worst camera footage ever what is going on🤣
you know no big man never ever gonna top Dirk. keep talking KAT
Am I the only one that thinks kennard won?? How the hell did Kat win?? They turned kenards time off and took off his points
BIG KAT!  FEB 2022
Wait where #30 at
This mans talent is insane.  I wish he was on a winning team
Wats going on with NBA , big man wins shooting contest and point guard getting double double rebounds ,🤯😤
Bring back the old version of the 3 pt contest without the extra money balls and deep shot...
Where’s Steph?
where is stephen curry ?
... Trae Young should have not participated until they review the foot step?
You didn’t shoot against Curry or Klay.
2 Peter 3:9 9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
Only way he would of lost is if it was the Slam Dunk contest.
Karl Legend walking in there and saying "who's playing for second?"
The Dew balls are so gimmicky. You can drain more 3s but still lose the contest bc of how unbalanced the bonus balls are. Bring back the old contest so it's actually a display of the best shooter.
That was amazing for a center
Kat deserved the win
I'm so happy for KAT!
The simple Gospel is to trust in the shed Holy Blood of Christ Jesus. BELIEVE in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is the Gospel! 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 which is the Gospel tells us that we are saved by trusting in the Lord Jesus death, burial, and resurrection. Ephesians 1: 13-14 says that we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise until the day that God redeems us. Ephesians 2: 8-9 is clear in that we are saved by grace through faith and not by our works or by what we do or do not do. It's all about BELIEVING in the Lord of Lords and King of Kings Jesus Christ.
I saw KAT finally smile.
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💯3 pt was more 🔥 than the dump Contest 👎🏿👎🏿 Congratulations 👏🏿to big Kat!
At least he won something 🤣
How many ads like the nba needs more money
Baltimore SportsCenter: High School Basketball: Milford vs Franklin -----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAxFtRCrnj4&t=15s
They need to change that thumbnail to the actual winner
So far this all star has been pretty wack
Curry or Thompson would of won it if they did participate. Congratulations to KAT
Waaay more exciting than the dunk contest
He butchered Middletown Ohio lol I’ll take it tho #513
3 point contest without Steph or klay? I’m good thanks..
I mean he did great getting that 3-point record but he still a bum.
🔥🔥🔥
Yo, I see 9th Wonder sitting behind Shaq! Salute to KAT, great shooting and a great win! 🙌🙌🙌
A center won a three point contest
Yaaaah Towns !!! Well Deserve King
Sry but all star weekend is jus unwatchable anymore...
bring me head of TATA group president.
Well deserved
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Imagine crowd could care less about the event
El domi
🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
YeSsiR🥴
Where da hell is Lavine ??
I’m just glad my boy Luke Kennard was there
Made me wonder if Kat was having a good night or if the real shooters had such an off night, it made a center look good. This allstar weekend was a symbolic "everybody gets a trophy for trying" mentality of today.
https://youtu.be/0qF27ITqnmE
We need better shooters in this. We need both currys, dame, klay, people like that. Way too many misses with these guys. All star competitions are about seeing the best, not the very good.
KAT 🇩🇴
Congratulations KAT!
Karl Anthony Towns!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Congrats kat. I just don't get why nba put trae as the thumbnail while kat was the real winner.
This used to be the best of the best of shooters. These are all 2nd tier shooters at best. Trash
YouTube getting too comfy with the ads like my gf saying “I’m too tired” for sex. Congrats big kat
“I’m going to vegas!” -wade 😂😂
Why Curry wasn’t in this
Congratulations KAT🔥🔥
Towns could have won this year’s dunk comp too. 😅
I'll only loose if someone out shoots me... you real smart huh
This was fun my pick was Luke kennard my pops didn’t kno bout him I had to tell him bout the clippers playoff run last year he was clutch a few games and he was on fire a few games him and trae made it interesting but KAT won it and deserved it
He about to be a Demi on 2k😭
Where is Wardell?
I’ve been saying he’s better than Anthony Davis but Davis just gets more hype cuz KAT is stuck in Minnesota so glad to see he’s finally getting the hype he deserves
Happy for Luke and KAT
weak sauce, they need curry and klay anyone else is just unwatchable.
You’re galaxy behind Dirk young fella
Kennard’s lefty stroke is beautiful!
If any nba team  could pair Cat and embiid together, it would be crazy.
there is no fun without Curry.....!!!!!!!!!
Where is Stephen Curry ?!
As someone new to nba basketball could someone please explain to me why Steph Curry doesn’t enter this every year if he’s the best shooter in the nba? Thanks in advance
Sponsored by Mountain Dew... a real health drink...  great job, NBA 😂
I think Kat benefited from going last then first. Still has his rhythm. Lot of time in between Luke’s rounds
Kat deserves that
the children making your shoes dont think much about the all looser game
To be fair in CJs last rack in the first round was a lil to the right on the side three so maybe he wasn’t so prepared as he would if shooting side threes (meaning maybe he used a different form than he usually does from the side)
I completely slept that this was this weekend I'm shitty thanks NBA for posting
Exactly what he needed. now he's really going to go beast mode after the break 💪
It's no longer self proclaimed he is the best big man 3pointer
Big man won it lol
I am so happy for KAT, that dude is going to enter his prime and is already an all time big ! So much respect man !
Somebody please trade for this guy he is wasting away his prime years in Minnesota.
Watched it in Cleveland congrats to KAT and the skills challenge was dope too go Cavs
Kat is so underrated!!! Dude is a beast and has been, it just feels like people rate him lower because of what Butler claimed he did to them at practice. I would choose KAT over Butler ANY day.
legit shocked KAT won this with such a dominant score. Altho trae was pretty close at 26, and probably coulda got 28 if he didn't mess around with his last shot cuz he knew he lost at that point. Good stuff KAT
I remember in the 2020 3 point contest Trae Young was at the bottom of everybody with 15 but this he made it to the Finals with 22 in the first round and 26 in the Finals, ICE TRAE right there, but congrats to KAT though 👏
I would trade Karl Anthony Towns today for Anthony Davis And would not blink. Two years ago Hell no. Karl Anthony towns for Anthony Davis now he has a motor and Anthony Davis has lost his confidence in his jumpshot and too brittle
Just like in baseball these guys are pooped and try to compete with world class athlete.  Kat will most likely miss the playoffs because of it.  Smh
Court side 🎥 https://youtu.be/HIDxnesiXmw
Great win towns such a himble player he told you shaq he told you jajajaja dayum i tought trae would have won but ggs towns
https://youtu.be/HIDxnesiXmw
Too many ADS
basketball and rap will never be the same again.
Best event- better than the Dunk contest. Congrats K.A.T!!!
Wow!
Didnt curry had 31 last year
KAT sign in warriors.
He don’t be in the paint anyways 😂 now he really bouta jack up 3’s
Trae Young is who we thought he was
He needed a 3 point contest trophy to prove he’s the best big man, 💀🤣🤣🤣🤣
No Steph, no challenge.
Cameron Johnson from suns is number 2 in league right now and wasn't invited.
Imagine a 3pt shooting contest with $1 Million as prize money! The field would be Larry Bird, Ray Ray, Reggie, Steve Kerr, Jason Kapono, Craig Hodges, Splash Brothers, Jeff Hornacek, Mark Price, and Steve Nash- all in their prime! Doesn't hurt to dream every now and then!
5:07 lol he did the durant
“Congratulations KAT……yes sir thank you”
Steph change the game. ✌️💪
Self proclaimed BEST BiG MAN shooting of all time  EMBIID and Jokic are watching ! 😅 Love n respect 4 KAT. Well deserved.
I told y'a
Vegas got the odds wrong
These are the best NBA shooters? SHAME
wanted trae but much respect to KAT
Kat is just a animal to be that fuckin big and knock down 3s that easy
Best part of the night was BIG KAT winning the 3pt🔥🔥, always knew he was gonna win it
6:43 Proof! That we are in a simulation.
I thought all the players shot well. I especially noticed the trade with McCollum to Nola. PS Congratulations! CJ
Props to KAT man he bet on himself and he won
Well deserved. Rest in Heaven mama Towns <3
Winning the 3 point contests doesn't mean you're the greatest 3 point shooter. It's different when you make 3s in game and has a defender. Nowitzki and probably Larry Bird are the most skilled and clutch 3 point shooting big men of all time.
Shaq taking notes from kat
You know Jimmy is gonna fine some weird crazy stat to talk about how this happened (really tall players shooting 3s) and even though we all know, the video will still blow our minds.
🇩🇴 💪🏽🔥
Steph also had 28 point in final round last year
Didn't Kennerd only make 2 shots from the corner (the first one and the moneyball) - so he should only have 3 points...right?
Hi nba
I dont know what sport this is but I was told that the boys were hatt
I don’t ever want to hear Steph Trae comparisons again. Steph was in a month long shooting slump this season and would most likely still score 25 or more per round if he was in this shooting contest.
🇩🇴🇩🇴💪
Kat did amazing but they counted 1 that didn’t go in in that first rack. Don’t believe me go back in watch closely.
I’m sorry but watching this 3pt contents I 100 percent believe Steph would’ve won if he was in it lol
El dominicano representa
Bendiciones viva RD
Congs KAT, well done
Why did it feel like after the first green ball, luke kennards count was a bit off. Maybe just me, felt like some balls stopped counting
No curry no Thompson Kat still didn't prove he's the best
A big man winning is crazy never thought I see the day
Apparently state farm is the priority
That’s my boy kat yesssss sirrrrr
You know the Slam dunk contest was azz when the 3pt contest gets more views 🥴🥴🥴🥴
He chose the arrogant answer playing 2k LMAO
XD pojebało go
The 3 point contests is so much more consistent than the dunk contest imo
Now I noticed KAT never jumps while shooting. Woa
That was dope!
Trae letting me down in real life and 2k🥲
BIG PURR!!!
Congratulations Karl Anthony Towns I'm Going To Veeeeeegas lol
Best shooting bigman of all time? WTF.  Haha.  Joke it's the all star anybody can win it.  He ain't. It's the actual game that counts
Karl Anthony can shoot
Didn’t Zach lavine play also ???!
The 3 point contest was exciting. If the dunk contest is going to be anything like it was last night, then they should move the dunk contest up and 3 point contest should be last.
Stephen curry 😣🕵️
🇩🇴•🔥
KAT *DESERVES IT*
this was very fun to watch.
Where is Curry
Bruh Luke kennard got 29 points in the first round if anyone with brain cells was counting
All star game are wack for years
who else saw that they gave luke kennard his second shot when he airballed
Where's Steady Freddy
Westbrook could never
Let’s goooooooo KAT
Kat was playing like Steph curry best big man shooter bro Kat is a nice man bro respect bro!
The lettering on the wolves jersey is sick
Trae ain’t even try for his last shot after seeing his score and knowing he can’t win. Shot that ball straight to the roof
He proved it for sure 🔥💯
No Curry?
"The only way Imma lose is if someone outshoots me" Well, isn't that how everyone loses tho?
3 points contest is way better than slam dunk contest now, well deserved KAT, the best center shooter in the league atm!
First Center NBA history 7'0 kyle anthony town 3points champion
No tyler Hero, klay, in this contest?! What a shame!
Where is CURRY???
KAT asked Steph for advice earlier and he actually followed it and he won the contest🔥
They should put porzingis in there 🔥🔥
Damn the ad, you cannot skip it.
How are you gonna post the full highlights and cut out my boy Freddy V
Congratulations KAT
Where Is curry?????
He neck and neck with Dirk for the best shooting big and I think he got it
Where was Curry?
looking right Stephanie. Well done on the interview
I'm confused about the people in the 3 point contest?
Mid contest
But this doesnt prove he the best shooting big man all time.....
Very impressive
KAT?!!!!!
Congrats KAT
At least put KAT in the thumbnail , y u putting Ice Twae in der EnnNbweeAeee???
Where my boy curry at
I had more fun watching this than the dunk contest
How the fuck do you lose a whole family to a virus with a 98% survival rate? Omg
They’re missing cause there’s nobody guarding them. They’re not used to shoot without a guard anymore.
🇩🇴🔥
Damn what a hell of performance Kat the best big man shooter and good on all of the other performers y’all did great and made this exciting 🔥🔥
😎👍
Muchas Felicidades  para mi Paisano 🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFz5GF7pIlc&t=230s
Basketball is as boring as baseball
Where the da fuck is curry?
Better than tha dunk contest. Time to bring Curry back out.  BOSS MODE! :D

YEAHHH KAT YEAHHHH KAT
CONGRATS KAT!!!!!!
Ironically,this was better than the dunk contest and I've never seen that before 🙄
I’m sad curry couldn’t be in the three point contest
Looking like big Sam Perkins out there☺
Congrats big man Town
Trae!!!! ATL.. ICE Trae🦾🦾🦾🦾
Go Towns! Go Towns!
Trae was super close to 30 if he didnt miss that 3 ball he was on fire on the last rack. Congrats to KAT tho
No curry no one cares
when KAT is your 2k Teammate 🤭 lmao
Why was cj in the 3 point contest he’s trash 😂😂💀💀💀
Music and dude on pa is distracting af
I'm so proud for KAT. He deserves the award. :)
Did CJ and KAT do the Steph shimmy?
I thought Zack Lavine was in this? Is this the full competition?
Patty Mills using jumpshot 98
its officially the BIG MAN's era
KATs been shoot great this year. Well deserved
Of course Kat wins in the year of the tiger lol
Sned MC Collum to Gleague
Congrats KAT!
I keep on saying this every year, MAKE THE 3PT CONTEST THE MAIN EVENT. Let's face it, the Dunk contest isn't that exciting anymore.
Where's The chef? Why didn't he participate?.........good job KAT u deserve it, but in general this contest was boring to me, maybe cuz I'm use to see this with curry
Great job, KAT! But Dirk is the God-Father of the big man shooting 3's he's a champion and a HOF! KAT now if you can shoot you way into the playoffs and get a victory will talk about best big man shooting ever. A contest don't make you great ask Harold Minor aka Baby Jordan!
KAT did his thing… but man, you need Steph, Klay, Joe Harris, Seth in this contest to really cement your seat as the best.
Love me some Kenard
Momma be proud Karl.
This is better than slamdunk contest.
NBA coaches: play small and shoot a lot of threes NBA big men: hold my beer
Who are they
breaking news: La Lakers trade Anthony Davis and THT for KAT.
the audience had no love for KAT smh. if it was curry, they would be going crazy. messed up.
Where Curry at?
I enjoyed the hell out of this three-point contest. KAT is right up there with Dirk . . .But the dunk contest was terrible! There was absolutely NOTHING new and everybody played it so safe. What did Kenny say, "You can dunk like that in your Tims, lol" For real, it was lame af.
👏👏👏
Notice how some of Luke Kennards points don’t get accounted for in his first attempt, starting from the second Mountain Dew ball. 🤔
Where’s curry?
Why do they need referees here
Steph just changed the game forever. The three point contest is more interesting than the dunk contest now lol, and every team relies on 3s to score now…
Dominican republic represent
Nowitzki is the best big man shooter of all time.
Comment sections full of 12 year olds spitting fake facts. He’s not the first big man to win. And yeah yeah, we know he went through a lot with his family deaths. Stop commenting only to get likes. It’s weird and screams of attention seeking.   Do better in life and grow up.
First big man to win 3pt contest  🔥
Yeeeeaaahhh 🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
Where’s curry
Only cause steph or Klay didn’t play
Big men with guard skills are taking over the league.
jersey love
better than the dunk contest
Only won cus none of the best shooters competed
Lebron now knows who to team up with next 😂
Where is Steph?
Put some Respect on Dirk man
Kt best shooting big
I dedicate .. the realest shit I ever wrote by 2pac to the new guys stay true 🏀 for eva
Mountain Dew money ball? Congratulations on ruining another thing with commercialism
I cant believe a center won the 3 pt contest
where's Steph???
where’s steph?
Haters are mad.
Why this year Stephen Curry didn't participated too and klay lol
Yet he didn't even compete against Cam Johnson. WHACK.
All commercials
Why didn't you invite Luka 😅
Dirk
Skills challenge and 3pts are way better than the slamdunk most of the contestants haven't finished their dunks next year we need zach vs gordon again
We will see you on stream KAT!!! LETS GOOOOOO!!!
Go big cat what you gone do...🐐
I swear I was gonna bet on KAT
💶💶💶💶💶💶
SWAG KAT !

Trae let me down
Was this the first time a center won a 3 pt contest?
Big KAT 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
Big  kat congrats ✊🏾
happy for KAT
6:40 epic moment
Look at KAT so inspirational
D'lo teaching KAT well
Dude says yessirrr to a female. L
What a professional.
Yes SIR????????  Wtf
Why curry didnt  play here
No curry, and no Klay. What's going on
Kat kat kat k town on fire 🔥 proud of him he came from a lot
why didnt steph and klay participate?😅
1 of the most underated player... he deserved it
Damm Kat is much faster than the rest, guess not needing to really jump on his shot helps
Tbh I never knew KAT could shoot like this!
Dwade be like self proclaim hahaha kat
Respect to KAT but Dirk will always be the best shooting big man 💯
KAT KORNY 🤡🥴
When he said “Jersey love” I had to go to google to see where he was from. Had no idea he was from dirty Jerz! Big ups to my hometown!!
crowd was dead
Can’t believe KAT broke the record
Congrats KAT
Why does KAT sounds like white man named rick 💀
?????????????
These dudes are tripping yelling from the booth 😂😂
dead 3 point contest
Peja Stojakovic would smoke all these bums even now.
This was more exciting than the slam dunk contest.
"The only way I'm gonna lose if someone outshoots me..."  And every 60 seconds in Africa, a minute passes.
Okay KAT, u can shoot. Now i understand why u proclaiming urself GOAT SHOOTING BIGMAN.  *But don't get too carried away tho, its STILL DIRK GOAT OF ALL GOATS SHOOTING BIGMAN*
Greatest Shooter of All Time No Doubt
KAT is the only center in nba history to win the 3 point contest 👏👏
KAT is underrated as a 3 point shooter. I hope he goes to a contender soon. Much respect
Es la primera vez que gana un pivot?
🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
Most of his 3 points shots come from straight on from the 3 point line. Big Kat putting Minnesota on the map. Congratulations Big guy. Way to make the Wolves proud. You see the name on this shirt I'm wearing. Let's Go Wolves.
Best big man shooter ever????? KD Dirk Nikola
7:00 uhhm steph got 28 last year
Siempre poniendo la 🇩🇴 bien alto, bendición 🙏🙏
Who curry?🥺
Where's Fred Vanvleet 💀
Great job Kat. You deserved it🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
Katt voice really got deeper 😂😂
Steph and Klay are just kind giving chance to others
Much respect 4 KAT32…I’m so happy 4 him…He deserves it!
Beast
Congrats kat
Where is Steph Curry?
3 point contest all day. Forget the dunk contest!
boring
Wtffff
This is probably a dumb question, but hey i'm dumb so that checks out. But my question is why is Steph Curry not in the 3 point contest..?
I didn't expect KAT to won the tournament but congrats anyway.
Why don't have Stephen and klay😭
I wish the commentators shut the fuck up during these.
No curry no Thompson 😁😁😁😁
KAT big ahh feet
Why no curry?
why no steph curry ion get it why he dont appear for it every year
Center is the 3 points contest champion
Salute to that man! I ain’t think he had the 3 gene in him like that #Respect #KAT 💪🏾🔥🔥
cam johnson would have taken it.
kat.. seing him in the warriors.. in the future xD
Damn Kat ok kat
I’m using  Kay jumper in 2k
The best contest is 3-pt no debate
Congrats to KAT
Let's go Big Cat 😾 😾
Fenomeno
From Down Towns!!!!😁✌️
The 3-point shootout should be the last segment for the 2nd day.
Wtf kattt
Jersey love, I remember him when he was young I never thought he would be who he is today, respectfully a big deal
The strength on KAT to essentially shoot threes from his wrist with barely even jumping.
I would trade AD for KAT
My vote was luck Kennard ...very underrated
140p Quality
where's steph?
Giannis will be here in a couple of years time im calling it 😂
Bakit nan dyan si dogie sa likod?
Trade that black diamond to Chicago bulls for draft picks and vucevic and we just won the league!!! Karnisovas do it man now 🐃
Curry play?
Yes kennard its the best 3 poin
Look a pretty smile of kennar . 👍
Ugly ass set shot 😒 kat
Curry ??😢
Where steph at?
✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
Oh no, now we gonna see kat chucking three pointers every game but congrats to him
This sucked just like everything in the new Woke Joke US!
Were is curry?
Lol they couldn’t let steph play cause he would destroy
Where is curry? This shi suck😂👎🏾
Why steph not participating
Basketball is changing and evolving that's fact and true see youngster do their stuff in the future long live !!
Fuckkk yeahhh i said KAT would win
I think Embiid could enter this contest and also have a chance to win it
How tf Kat didn't make the thumbnail!? 🤦🏿‍♂️✌🏿
Abnormal from wolves got 29...huhu
CJ Trash
Don't let that wrist wander.
Trae should have won. Kat was cheating, i saw him put magnets on the ball and the net, so rigged. Can’t believe people think this is legit
Wow he won it and with a high score. Beating some of the leagues best shooters
Forgetting about dirk man
WHERE’S CURRY?!
what's the song in the background?
Fuck cat
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED OMSIM DILOS SAKALAM LAKERS NATION MATIK
Team KD ✊🏾
WTF TOWNS 😵😆
That must be amazing because it’s the first big man to win that contest Game has came a long way
We need a Shaq vs Ben Wallace 3pt contest.
The big men starts to dominate the nba again! The top 3 in mvp ladder are also big men and now KAT just won the 3 point contest. This is the big man era now
Congrats KAT 🥲🥲🙏🙏
This was actually good with 26 Kennard would have won almost any other year
Ice In His Veins 🧊
Ayo decrease the no of ads dawg, the first 5 minutes already 2 fifteen seconds ads.
Cat is  a beast well deserved
I don't think the 3 point needs the extra gimmicks, they keep adding more bonus points, makes the records fake
Can we talk about how many adverts there are on this video.. smh
No we need curry vs kat
Top 💩 this year
This is now the most pointless event in the NBA since every game is now a 3 point contest.
Alguien puede aclarar mi duda porque no esta el rey de los triples? STEPHEN CURRY‼️👹
No Curry no Party
Ovaj Mills ko pijan baca
" Vegas got the odds wrong "  lmaoooo that was hilarious
Guys Stop Fighting KAT Has The record for Most Points In the finals  And Curry has the record for first round      Stop Fighting and i just want to clear things up
Choker James McCollum 😂😂 He looked like he was about to cry when KAT was shooting. 😂😂
Sad that Trae lost but so happy for KAT. He deserves it
Ovaj McCollum nemoze pogodit slona u supak s metra
Let's go KAT
now KAT we need a big man in GSW!!! this was a wow moment eliminating CJ and  Trey.
Why no Steph?
How you a PG and lose to a center at 3pt?
☝️
agora ele vem  pro Brasil
I love how patty hits a shot and the comentator is saying and he hits the 3 pointer
KAT 🔥
Where's curry at
Kat was Poppin his shit 💯💪
Before the 3pt contest KAT said "I'm the best big men 3pt shooter" he wasn't lying
Congrats to KAT and a very late condolences to him and his family. Also, where was buddy hield? This was a pretty entertaining moment.
Yup! the best sharpshooting centre of all time based on inflation adjusted points per possession.
Well deserved
Accept Jesus now.. Pray.. Admit that you are a sinner.. Repent.. And Accept Jesus as your personal SAVIOR.. God Bless you all.
Well deserved!!! Set a new record too!!
P
This is in my opinion a B team 3 point contest! The real shooters chilled on the sidelines
Latin big man winning 3pt contest in NBA...danng this era is weird asf. ¡¡¡TE LO MERECES BIG KAT!!!
Desmond bane didnt do it?
I am so happy for KAT, that dude is going to enter his prime and is already an all time big ! So much respect man !
Bruh why isn't curry there he would've won
did they cut out traes second attempt or what
...."I'm bout to Go Back and See LARRY BIRD...in the 3pt Contest. 🐐 "FANNNTASTIC"!! 🏀 "LARRY LEGEND" IS THAT DUDE!!!  "I WANNA SEE BIRD:!!!🏀
Congrats KAT!!! Trae ain’t no Steph lmao!!!
Is he gay?
Where's Curry
Who decides who's gonna play in the 3-point contest?
Bro cost 9 elixir
Reggie Miller is ao annoying
I dint like how they keep adding points and then talk about breaking records. Yeah you're gonna score more points when you start adding Whole 2 point racks, and then 3 point balls. Peja would have the record 🤷🏽‍♂️😂
Yeeee ohhhhhhhh
Kat …. You earned it man !
Really enjoying All Star Weekend 🙌
steph curry is shaking
KAT is what Lakers thought AD is..
Trae shame of you
That tuff ok KAT 💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Love you kat
Kennard should have won that, why did the score not go up when he got past the top of the three point line???
1:19 ref not even looking at his feet 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Curry? Klay?
6:42 at back of trey young. XD They sync
W
Unlucky for those guys our man Steph was somwhere else 😎😊
Allll In ""Reap Young" cause Im A Young Too All The Way ...
Glad kat won, he was my pick
He a solid man 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
KAT!!!
i like how it didnt even show all the participants like where the hell is lavine?
OMG KAT
Go Check Out King Swift "Sold My Soul"
It's sad to watch without Wardell
Why Curry not joining?
Congrats CAT. 😺
Timberwolves nation stand UP! BIG KAT THE BEST BIG SHOOTER OF ALL TIME!!!
Why does the 3pt Contest more entertaining than the Dunk Contest this year?  Congrats to KAT btw 🏆
Cam Johnson would have smoked him
Where Luka at?
Congratulations my Big fella KAT
They cheated Kenner’s that first round on Mtn Dew ball.
Congrats to KAT, but Dirk is still hands down the best shooting big man of all time. It might be a different story by the end of his career, but for now he can't claim that title.
how did fred do?
:))
🤩
Damn curry really change the game even the big man now can shoot.props to cat tho straight 🔥🔥🔥.
🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
Congrats to CURRY
Dang KAT is a sniper
Why is Curry not in the comp? Weak ass group
Please Lakers 🙏 trade AD for KAT
Who would’ve thought KAT would have won
Amazing
Congrats KAT 🔥🔥🔥🏆
Can’t believe this shit just happened… I don’t hate Karl but the shooters performed worst of their lives…
KAT representing New Jersey and DR 🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴...! 💪 👊..!
Look at curry man..
We always put the money ball on the 2
im so happy Kat won the contest, he been thru a lot of shit and im just happy to see him takin his ransom
Hey, luke kennard in the 1st round made the second green sprite ball or whatever and didn't get the points
You are not the best shooter big man all time this young generation need drug test
Where is curry and tompson????
Zach really joined the wrong contest. He could've had 3 dunk contest trophies by now lmao
Larry Bird still the best
Kennard has the sweetest stroke since Michael Redd.
Big Baba can shoot.
😍🥰😍🤩🤩
Bunch of weak mf on the 3point contest but ok I see what y’all doing NBA
Good shit Kat
3 points contest different when Curry and or Klay are not joining. 🤭
is dirk the best shooting big man?
Thats cheating. He wasn't jumping lol :P. Seriously. Congrats Kat! You deserve it :)
well done KAT!
I dont expect that carl anthony will win this contest
KAT is so underrated. Who cares about defense? These is a scorers' league I dream of pairing him with Giannis. Unstoppable big combo.
Next year Giannis and Blake Griffin in the 3pt finals vs Towns let’s go
If only Mark Price had so many money balls 🏀 💰
Towns > overrated LehelpmeKyrie
Hey @nba , test out the two tone ball. It’s really great to see the spin and English on the ball.
God bless this man 😢
2:00 they didn't count the mountain dew shot
Kentucky Wildcat yeah 💪🏾🤙🏾
Needs more adds
He came and he conquered!!
What about dirk
What the fuck KAT won 3 point concest I can't believe my eyes
Ooo so paja and dirk must of died ya funny as hell🤣🤣
The league has changed so much. A center just won the 3pts contest, which was WAYYYY more interesting than this parody of a dunk contest we had this year. This is weird ...but cool. KAT killed it.
Salute KAT, unpredictable, awesome
Big kat 🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀⛹‍♀️
He said to Shaq, Jersey up!
Damn bro it was like the crowd wasn’t hyping them up or even try to make feel like game atmosphere..😭😭 whole arena was quiet ..
2nd 7 footer (almost) to won the 3 pt contest. Congrats KAT!
LETS GOOOO BIG MAN WINS IT, I WAS WANTING A BIG MAN TO WIN THE 3 POINT CONTEST.
🔥🔥🔥
Damn ok KAT 💦💦💦
D Wade one of the most annoying talkers on TV, get him TF off commentary
Kat is the best center
go luke! 3PG!!!
Wow big man champions 3 point contes 2022.😊👏👍
Where is Bogibomb?
His 3point stat in 2k finna be bussin
Mofo who tf is in charge with the scoreboard
Peja Stojakovic still the best.
Ice Trae was ice cold as usual
Dominicano en la casa
8:08 hehe doable
Fuk off with all the adds YouTube
Where is Steph? Where is Klay? This is dumb.
Still better than nothing in his career LoL
KAT won't be saying those words if Klay and Steph play in the 3pt contest.
This contest shows the best three point shooter under these set of rules
Shot out 2 dem Bengals do shooting Dere shot at da super bowl ... Next year 💀
PROPS!!
Dominican Repúblic Is very proud of you 🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
luke kennard's mountain dew shot graphic confused me i thought it went in
Trae was close but Kay set a freakin record
Luke was supposed to win that
Why my duncan didnt join?
Dirk
That was crazy
Headphone Loudspeaker-amplifier
I love that KAT won! Very happy for him
Wait KAT said “ yessir “ to her ? Lol .
Nice extra bonus balls. Coz of d evolution of basketball there should also be bonus shots on logo
Where curry :(
not the full video
LETSSS GOO KAT!!! THATS JUST THE BEGINNING! MUCH MORE BLESSINGS COMING YOUR WAY. 🙌🏼🙏🏼 #4MAMA
Bro said yes sir 🤣
The sites over POLVIC/23
where is curry?
Luke kennard appreciation comment
Confused, why was steph not in this??
Better than the dunk contest by a lot
🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🔥🔥🔥🔥
Embiid better
des will be back
lucky 3 point shooting contest
Yo, nobody realise how they didn't count Kennard's 2nd mountain dew ball on his first run? He acc scored 29! NBA stop making mistakes bruh pls.
Thats the meaning of lucky day...lol
We love Kat man. Such a good guy
Can someone tell the music they playing in the background?
DAMNN KAT, i didn't expect KAT in 3 point contest
I hope next year there is a skills challenge featuring the referees
D Wade is the worst commentator lol
Even now bigman can shoot 3's...
No curry no party
Full contest? Didn't show half of the first round
KAT 👍
LES GO KAT
Vanvleet was nervious Af
KAT's moneyball rack should've been left wing😂
KAT is a frustrating player incredibly talented and super skilled and athletic too he and Anthony Davis are the best big men in the league but are mentally weak that's the difference between them and Gannis and Joel Embiid
молодец кат
Lil Wayne is on high mode..
Steph is a legend. They be doing the shimmy
Where steph?
Cam Johnson would’ve won. Suns snubbed
❤️
Yes... KAT the best 3pt shooting  big man ever!
Almost beat steph curry's 31pts
Kat is what Lakers really need.
Where is curry tho??
Bigs changing the game out here. Congrats KAT
YOUNG CHOKE ARTIST.
Thanks Luke !!
skills, and now this
how come the full videos of saturday are nowhere to be found on the league pass !!!!!!!!
Wow! Great shooting KAT!
Wade and Reggie got some great chemistry
KAT 🏆 The Detractors Loses ! 👅
Their Supposed to be sharpshooters, and they keep Bricking 😂👎
New record??? The previous guys didn't have the dew ball that counted as 3...
Mad corny
What's  crazy is towns won and  I picked  him the greatest  big man  shooter  he should  deserves  it  respect  for  improving  his shot he's  a  threat  now
The assist challenge boring throwing a ball in a circle.. wow people like that shit
Gotta be honest this was impressive.
KAT need to be more ARROGANT
Shit was boring .. the nba allstar week is a dud
Bobby Portis would destroy them all! He would hit 30 minimum!
Let this woulda been 2k22 they can’t miss
This tells you that curry is the goat
Good for KAT
Kat deserves it! Amazing.
NOW THIS WASNT BAD  This was actually interesting to watch
damn, 2 shots almost came in for KAT, imagine having a record of 31/32 thats unbeatable
3pt contest > Dunk contest
TALK TO ME KATTTTT
I will disagree to him being the best big man 3pts shooter. Joel Embiid, Nicolas Jokic are both centers and shoot better than Kat
Lol trea young is not valud
He needs to go to Golden States to be the splash trio
why do you have the winner in the description?
29/40 isn’t really that impressive tbh
IceTrea came close but congrats to kat tho
My guy deserves all the good things fr he goated
where's curry and klay?
KAT, a center/big, winning the 3-pt contest means the game is evolving/evolved...
Where’s curry?
A Center winning 3pt contest and setting a record? This the Multiverse of Madness NBA Edition
I saw them +1200 odds and knew I shoulda placed a bet
JERSEY!!!!!
luckily curry or klay weren’t participating
the kat is hot...😆
Wheres duncan robinson???
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” ❤️‍🔥🙏
next KAT playing Shooting guard after that winning the 3point contest .lol😁😂
who the hell chose these 3 guys to compete for the 3 point contest ? this is bullshit.  I don't know about any other fans but I want to see steph curry , Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Clay thompson, kyre Irvin. James hardin. I dont watch the game because its point less. Fake.  But the dunk and the three point contest, they fckg it up am I right? Now I dont want to watch B.S. 🙄😒🤦🏾‍♂️🤨. NBA let me down. 👎🏽
Isn't dirk a bigman?
What does "Full" mean to you people?
Bruh I thought cj was gonna win 😂 but much respect for kat dude is good for a tall guy 💪🏾🔥 always like Kat cuz he plays with high energy and always stays positive even after his mom did from Covid 19 his mom would be proud rn 🙏🏾
Wait i never knew it was all star already 😂 is this how dead nba is
He's still not better then Dirk
CONGRATS CAT!
boring no curry
I liked the old 3 point contest trophies better than this new version.
Dirk vibes 🔥from a mavs fan
It’s dumb that they changed the format and it’s dumb it doesn’t go head to head 👎
How come curry aint in this one
Never really seen him play didn't know he could shoot like dat
KAT lost 8 people from Covid.. some solace at last!
LETSSSSS GOOOOO CALLED IT!!!!
What's the league coming to when guards allow a big man to beat them at their own game 🤣.
Kat looking so soft. Best shooting big he says but taking his team Ls.
I guess it's a big men year
trae young sucks lmao
That lady at trophy presentation is so awful
They sure as hell didn’t want white boy to win
They sure as hell didn’t want white boy to win
No Duncan or Strus
Jersey 🔥
Terrible shooters 👎👎👎
Dirk is the best big man shooter of all time
this is not the full video u fuckers
Non of these guys can be curry and get 38 curry shouldve participated
Only won cause curry wasn’t there
Congratulations to kat but this is kinda sad that trae young let a big beat him in a 3pt contest but still congratulations
Jersey Love 💯🥶🥶
Wow ....amazing  kat !
Lucky none of the warriors were in it 🤷🏽‍♂️
two hands for safety
BIG MAN KAT @ +1300 WAS great hit from downtown
Why is curry not joining the 3 point contest ?
No curry no Thompson  boring
That must be amazing because it’s the first big man to win that contest Game has came a long way
Congrats Towns!
Wasn’t vanvleet in this too
respect to all the participants, but that little background jingle fucking suuuuccckkks,
No Kevin Harlan in commentary
Beating the 3pt record with all these new extra money ball racks kinda makes the record less impressive haha. But it’s still a big feat for the big men!
Good job KAT
This should be the last event next year. The slam dunk contest is fucking dead.
Why the time limit tho? Why not let 'em shoot at their leisure to see who's really the best shooter?
Congrats to KAT on winning the 3PT contest. He killed it yo!
Jesus loves you!!
Where is curry
Embiid, should join 3pt contest next year✌🏼😁
Why doesnt Luka join this thing? But very good for KAT. Good job dude, big man taking it home
Kat
Is Craig Hodges' record still safe? 🏆
Kat is waaaay overrated, what a fluke
Why Steph Curry isn't involved?
Congrats to KAT. Best big man shooter. Guess embiid will just havta settle for mvp for now
Rudy>
It's the year of the bigs 🔥🔥
Why is vanvleet not in the video
Bkt Wala c curry or thompson
Only event worth watching
Damn my man moms would be proud r.i.p to her
Between that annoying music and that announcers horrible voice I'm suprised they made any shots
He deserves it may god keep blessing him 🙏🏽 hope he stays healthy 💪🏽
KAT Nowitzki
KAT wins 3pt contest Steph:Finally! A worthy opponent
Man KAT is like Nowitzki
Dirk best shooter big man . But KAT up there
You know the NBA game has become soft, when a center wins a 3-Point contest
Kart Anthony - curry
This contest was soft.  Steph curry would've smoked everybody.
No thompson?
Curry took a year off
amazing skill from KAT, hope the meet lakers on play in game
The fact that Kat won told you this was a bum contest. It's really nothing if you don't have the best talents or stars competing.
☺ Spoiler alert! So what they throwing you off by showing Trae's pose pic...surely didn't win! Cause Big Man K.A.T. took it all! 🥰
Clay and Steph just giving everyone a chance this year lol
Didn’t steph have 31 in the final round last year 😹
KAT <3
We're is the goat
KAT did it for jidionpremium
When 7 footer shoots better than white shooter that's when you know He's dangerous
Platano power!!💪💯
I want to see my boy Cam Johnson in the next 3pt contest 😤😤😤
Lol he said yes sir
Why wasn’t curry or Klay in it
KAT definitely up there as one of the best shooting big men. Arguably the best shooting center.
no offense but im kinda disappointed about this years 3 point contest so umm im still waiting for the all star game cause honestly man this years 3 point contest is hella weird i really thought that steph would be in this
Where is curry?
Lefties make my skin crawl lol
Wla c cury
Doesn't make any sense how this is more entertaining than the dunk contest every year now.
Wow KAT is Such a sharp shooter
Sad to say but the 3pt contest was the most entertaining out of the 3 events. Skills challenge was an absolute joke and the dunk contest was ruined by the dead crowd and terrible announcers. Remember when the dunk contest was hype in the 90s and early 2000s. It’s so bad now and it’s not the players faults they were doomed from the start
Dirk says f@ck you mofo say what💍💍💍💍got this also 😆🤣😂👊
Right this brother dont do it when it matters, is soft as shid and looked like an ass on wheel of fortune. Play like a big man, big man
Let embiid join haha
They really let a PF/C win the 3pt contest and set a record
Curry woulda had 30+
Nobody at all :  D Wade : Did he look disappointed?
KAT +1200 damn
Let’s go Karl
Is it only me, tray young in round 1 wasn't in this highlights? Or something.
I'd like to see the scores broken down so they can be compared to the old rules and these scores compared to old ones. Going by the original rules, KAT would've had 23, not 29, in the final round. Kennard _also_ would have scored 23, and it would have gone to an extra round.
Is it me or did they jip kennard on like 8 points?
if ben simmon join 3 point contest it's a wrap
Congrats KAT! Nice to see my Wolves represent :))
High scores mean nothing when you add extra bonus points every year to make the scores higher
Larry Bird is laughing his ass off watching this s**t !!!
Let's go KAT 🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
u realized Center won the 3pt shooting contest
Lol they ain’t want my boy steph curry participating cause they know nobody else would have a chance to even beat him
Rigged lol
that garbage guy in atl choked again lmaoo
BIG KAT. To be only 26, losing moms, had to shed a tear for you and your family. You deserve it man! Much love! Much respect! Prayers!
Tb Omari im not going to the nba but im going be a big time rapper
Now the wolves coach will make him a center point guard.🤷🤷
Like if this was better than the dunk contest
Bruh KAT won the skill challenge back in 2016, now winning 3-pt contest, he is more a point guard than a center now😂😂😂 his post game is still not too good compare to other elite centers...I will trade his point guard skills for more post move skills
aight aight iono of best shooting big man ever lol ima have to give that to dirk but u good too
Didn’t even show everyone. Didn’t see Book or Bane or Young’s first round
🇩🇴🇩🇴 love Dominicana
its a new era, everyone shoots 3's well
Them other guys should be ashamed of themselves.. How u gonna let that big man beat you at your own game.. 🤯
Can u guys imagine a centre won the 3 points contest?!
Porzingis will beat him💪💪💪
Lol he said "Yessir" to that woman
Missed seeing. The opportunity for Cameron Johnson to compete.
Having a record for the 3pt contest sounds weird, given how they change the rules and scoaring system every year
For both, very surprised LaVine and VanVleet didn't get into the 20s in the 1st round. I was thinking the ones to advance would be Trae, Patty, and Towns. So good contest🔥🏀
finally saw stephanie ready's face the "twohandsforsafetymentator" lol XD
CJ should’ve chosen Top Key as his money rack, what a disappointment for his money rack
A big man won ✊
Need to take that stupid green ball out fr
Wow Kat win this I was expecting Tray to win but congrats to Karl Anthony Towns
KAT was amazing in this. wished curry was here that wd have been even more epic.
Go back to 2:07 Luke kenard hit 14 then hit the 3 to make it 17 never got counted for it and he hit 29 the first round
Yeahhh Kat 🔥🔥🔥
Lethal shooter way better than cj ans bane
This was more entertaining than the dunk contest
First big man to win the challenge contest as a rookie, BIG KAT..now, the first big man to win the three point contest, THE BIG KAT, AGAIN..THE MAN IS A BEAST !!!!!!
Wheres steph curry 😑
Man this event looks so different without Steph, Klay, Dbook and Hield.
Luke had 33 points and some other guys had more/less points. Is this rigged too?🤦🏾‍♂️
Good showing by Trae Young. Glad he was able to participate.
announcers weren’t cheering for Kennard cuz he’s white
terribly edited.
Красавчиг 29 💣
Meanwhile the dunk contest😪😴😴
Woah didnt expect KAT to win the 3points! But well deserved🔥
this years All Star festivities should have been done by the Hornets announcers... no energy here...
Better than the dunk contest
Lest goooo!!!!! 🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴❤️
Two 26's and a 29 for the final round is incredibly tough, shooters shoot
Yung kalabaw nakatali sa puno😍
How does anybody els not notice that they didn’t give Kenard his points for the second green ball he made in his first attempt? This shit is rigged lmao
I miss curry on 3pt contest
KAT never gonna let anyone forget this 🤣
Curry most definitely proud of Kat 💯💯
how u just NOT gonna show everyone?? i missed desmond bane, idc if he did bad, but like how u just not gonna show everyone? smh.
Nice
WTF, curry is the best player in 3 points heeellooooo
This man is wasting his talent on a bad team.
Kat 3pointer in 2k better be higher then trea young
My boy KAT 3pt champion well deserved bro the best shooting big in the league 🔥🔥🔥👿
Why does Desmond bane looks like tay-k
CONGRATS KAT!

Good for KAT!
the 3-point king is missing😐
They gotta raise his 3PT rating by 7
센터가 우승하다니ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ
What happened to the best shooter in the game? Lmfao 🤣
LUKE KENNARD GOT 28 and 26 and STILL LOST
thank god KAT is my PC
Again stupid cum.t nba showing the result already what the fuking point of highlights
KAT  🇩🇴 !!!
They gave it to the black guy cause its black history month js
Stephen curry vs Towns
I actually though KAT would shoot the worse tonight. He proved us all wrong
♥️🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
Worst 3 points and slamdunk contest in the nba  all star weekend history.
A center who beats all pg and sg🌝
Why would yall put Trae up there and not Kat??? Y'all cap
Legendary!
Trae still the best shooter in the league besides the baby face assassin
Where’s bane?
KAT!!! Wooooo❤
A big man won the 3pt contest. Truly, the NBA is evolving 😮.
Honestly Kat is one of the most underrated players in the NBA
KAT had the advantage because he didn't have to jump as high as the others. Almost a set shot. Fatigue wasn't a problem for him.
Congrats to KAT for winning the 3 pt contest! What a ride he had during the pandemic. Well-deserved win!
Nigga cj all like bet on me lol
Was waiting for D -  Wades son / daughter to make an appearance ??
“IM GOING TO VEGAS” 😂😂😂😂

I’m not expecting this. KAT won the 3-pt contest. Great job! 👏
Respect to KAT🙏🏿
Please stop talking Reggie Miller
Big man winning the 3pt contest... That's weird as hell
Dirk is still the best shooting big man FOREVER !!!!!
This man belongs on a contender.
Where is Russ?
Merecido 🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴💪🏽💪🏽
Got love for that young man.  He has gone through a lot with Covid.  Congrats  Jerzeee baby
Kennard don't got range
Bro even how kat killed it both trae and kennard where one ball off, CRAZY
+850 smh
KAT deserves all this respect. Being a big man in the 3pt contest is the future 😤🔥
Kevin love leave the chat xD
Where's FVV?
NBA should include Luca Doncic for the 3pt contest
bruh lil nas’ song is the first thing i heard after clicking the vid
Bakit kulang kulang??
they didn’t include that dew ball for kennard
Im sorry i doubted you.😂
Cool-Hand Luke 👌
Wait, a 3pt contest without Curry??
3 Point contest doesn’t feel the same without curry..
He needed the trophy for the clout.
Well done KAT If I’m not wrong, he’s the first ever center to win the three point contest, no?
Where is curry  Why is no one asking this
Respect to KAT but not DWade for ruining dunk contest 🤡
They counted Luke Kennards airball 1:19.
Kat 🇩🇴 ❤❤🙏🙏
Camera giving everyone a headache moving up and down!
why curry is not there?
did not expect that lol
Dang.. Cam Johnson would have killed this competition.
I’m sorry, not my thing with these bigs rotating out to trey land instead of inside on pick and rolls. The flavor of the game changes for the worse
Trae young lmao
Let’s go TOWNS REPRESENT MINNESOTA
Doug Mcdermott should be there
3pt contest better then the dunk contest now. How the mighty have fallen
gotta admit, KAT proved somethin tonight. Mans can shoot 💯
BIG KAT 💯💯💯
🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴
Curry and Klay are disqualified for being Gods.
Congratulations Big man
Why would they have this in Cleveland 😂
Put the WINNER in the thumbnail bruh. Also ur dunk contest sucks asf.
Why was curry not a part of it ?
This the most boring one yet
KAT is the man! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh my thumb. Lmao.
So weak embarrassing
Sweet stroke
Ohhhh how weak can it get. Fk these take 10 participation award mrhrfkrs. Stop selling Dominique.
3pt contest without Curry or Klay is just weird.
9
Female interviewer: Congratulations on winning the 3 point contest... KAT: Yes Sir!
Curry is the best💪💪
Yessir KAT!😎
All those guards n a pf won 🤣
How do you justify using the word "full" in the title?
Towns shot was smooth asf 🏀🔫
Cj really gonna shimmy & brick that mf 😭😭😭
Now all he needs is a good post up game
Let's go wolves  💪
Karl they're going to kick me out man!!!!!
Embiid is still your daddy
KAT>>>AD.
Let's go Kat
finally kat gettin the respect he deserves i’ve literally watched every fucking grueling timberwolves game he’s ever played in so believe me i knew he was special the day he first played kobe
why not just show all the shooters first round?
SO HAPPY FOR KAT!!!! 😭
I honestly don't like the changes with the dew ball, they should keep the same scheme. I like that you could compare shooters from 100 years from now to each other, when they all played the same format. Too much changes just inflate the score, just the racks and pick your money rack position is better.
Where was vanvleet
"Vegas had the odds wrong"😂😂
For KAT to win this definetly a wow moment
Good job patty mills money ball on the second raw.
Look at Kat man so inspirational
another bigman from the wolves to win the 3pt contest
Money ball first or second raw not already tired.
Did the all star game already end? for today?
It actually better then last year .. I mens the trophy
NBA ruling in 3 pts wrong? Add score in round 1 and round 2 , the highest number is the winner Kennard in rd 1 28 plus 26 in round 2 =54
"two hands for safety" stephanie ready
is he the first 7 footer 3pts champ?
Worst 3pt contest ever , worst dunk contest ever , all star game better be good
Lol im expecting curry here. Lol
Center 3 point shoot out and PG dunk contest what everyone needs
Should've been total points all together 😭
i think hes KAT mom is so proud to him
Go KAT
Big fella
Happy for KAT, he seems to be a good dude
damn a 7 foot guy winning the 3 point comp, who would have known
That's a whole lot Covid up in the audience
I LIKE KAT
Were is curry?
The splash of the year
How in the-?
this highlights are shit, nba need to hire a guy that can actually edit and put all the highlights
So sad not to see curry and klay in the three point contest
Patty Mills looks like Gary Trent Juniors cousin
I wanted to see klay  on this
Before the 3 point contest: "Why the hell is KAT in the line up??"
Steph would've won it if he never declined
"25 will win it" *everyone gets at least 26*
When you thought big guys cant shoot threes. Man shaqa era is over.
The PA commenting the contest in the background pisses me off
If long shot from behind longer than three Town
I’m glad they got Mountain Dew to sponsor this after all the Clorox deaths
im proud of him.   thats my team and power forward ,lets Go Wolves
This was one of the better shooting performances that's the crazy part
nigga why is trae young the thumbnail😭
Hahahahahha
Cam Johnson should’ve been here
Big man b taking everything💪
"Karl-Anthony Towns recorded 29 PTS in the Championship Round to win the 2022 MTN DEW 3-Point Contest" why put this in the description you're always spoiling stuff for people who missed it. always gotta close my eyes when scrolling
KAT: This for you mom🥺❤
No one even talked about luke kennard
Get out of satan system and get in God system before it's to late ⏳
Feels different when no Curry and Klay in this contest.
No Knicks 😒
The KAT in the house goes around the three pointer. Anna Mochizuki and Yukari Mizumoto gonna love it!
He wasn't spewing bs, backed up his words with his actions.
This is not the full contest where's like 70 percent of the players?
Trae needs to slow down when he is taking the shots
New Jersey 🇯🇪😎
kat el domi que representa
Wtf are these highlights tho didn’t even show anyone else’s play
Won the skills challenge, and now 3pt challenge. The Man's a Monster
🏀🏀☺☺✅✅👍👍👏👏♥️♥️✅✅💯💯💯🏀🏀🏀👍👍💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥😃✅🏀
Jersey Love ✊🏾
Kat
3-POINT CONTEST WINNER: KARL ANTHONY TOWNS
KAT THE GOAT
omg
KAT is the best overall center in the league ✍️
Expected more from Fred lol but isokay, as long as he keeps making em clutch baskets in real games
I love it😻  But Where Is Stephen Curry?
early gang
Kat is the best overall player in the League ✍️
I wanted Kennard to win it
Known as the best shooting big for a reason. Congrats to KAT! Btw I make daily NBA vids! My most recent are on the MVP and DPOY races! Check it out!😀
Cj is great tonigth
Why are Curry and Booker not in?
Trae would've had it, messed up
2nd best three-point shooter in the league
Yea
Hell ya
KAT deserves to be happy. Best shooting big man ever!  He's been through so much. God bless him.
KAT channeled my power and won lol
Go kat
First time Drake ever missed 🤦🏽‍♂️
So happy for KAT right now 💥💥
w
first
That’s cool
Let's be honest no one expected Karl to win
At least, D-Wade stuck to his guns with his pick of KAT. Nobody expected him to do what he did in this event
first comment?
fiesta comment!
lmaooo KAT really went for the win
first
