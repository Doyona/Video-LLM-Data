Which fight are you most excited for?!
Well, Izzy wasn’t wrong when he said dustin needs to avoid the ground with Charles
my bet is on kai, and its heavy
Izzy respect olivera ✊
So we should bet Izzy?
As usual…style-bender was correct. Though Nunes was unlikely to be beaten…Pena approached the fight exactly the way style-man recommended
If i only listened to him xD
Izzy the 🐐
Sick analysis Izyyy! Love your content champ
U have to take a shit thats what you said. On a public domain.You are a african peasant after all.Youre gonna remove this comment again?you have an ass fetish.Humping costa,grabbing marvins behind..whats next youre gonna bang whitaker?
Hey Izzy! Im a Big fan. When are you gonna review Alex knocking you out?
FIRST(!) time seems Izzy likeable for me.NATURAL BEHAVIOR is what used to miss.No need to be always funny.Its for teenagers.
Izzy didn’t watch Pedro vs Jose Aldo huh
your videos and analysis are so precise and well thought, much love bro, like you can see the future. MMMAAANN
Is the other guy who talks in the back Ghanaian 🇬🇭
Charles is too "hittable" and really needs to tune up his striking.  Chandler almost took him out, and Poirier dropped him on Saturday.  Props to his amazing durability and to recover on the ground under fire.  But Charles can possibly be the next GOAT LW if he shores up his weakness in the striking department.  That said, a guy like Khabib who went 29-0 looked awkward AF when striking, except the fear of the TD made it easier for him to pop far superior strikers like Conor for instance.  So Charles may be able to compensate his weak striking with better TD's.  Dude needs to train with GSP.  Get guys to the ground and 9 times out of 10 they're at his mercy.
Eshay 🤣
How does he know so much? Does he work for the ufc?
Julianas saving grace in that fight is she can take a punch, Amanda couldn't put her away in that first round and that rattled Amanda, caught her off guard.
My Boy Geoff Neal Don't Get No Love Izzy
Stylebender predict the future he good
You killed me with 'the Sacrifice' 🤣🤣🤣
Izzy's striking analysis is elite. If he wants to post-career, he'd be a phenomenal trainer
I think he sense an Pena upset.  I loss so much money on Amanda but congrats Pena.
is ufc fixed how comes most prediction and break downs are right
2:33 what a story
It´s unreal to me that weed isn´t legal everywhere, I live in Sweden btw.  I´m forced to go thru a 12 step program to stop smoking, even tho it´s the only medicine that helps my anxiety and sleeping problems.  But the doctors have no problems giving me pills instead.  It´s really fucked up because every other famous athlete in America smokes weed and they´re more succesful than my doctors will ever be.
Only Islam can dethrone Oliviera
I'm especially impressed by his Nunes/Pena comment.
Ryan hall is nuts
Do you have an email for business inquiry?
DOMINIK CRUZ SMELT LIKE WEED , THATS BASICALLY THE SAME AS SMELLING LIKE ALCOHAL AND CIGS
Yo fuck you Israel
Watching this after the fights, you can tell Izzy’s fight IQ because nearly everything he said would happen ended up happening
Thanks for these breakdowns Izzy. Helping us casuals make more informed bets to get the bag
Izzy shitting himself at 2:11 was something I'm glad I had my volume on max for LOL
1:37 😂😂😂 fucking David ur a legend for that combo editing
I from Brazil,sou seu fã Adesanya um lutador Excelente e inteligente...Deu Charles do Bronx.... "The King Charles"
Isreal didn't even tell us who is going to win, Dustin or Charles 🤭😃
My man izzy was spot on, swear to god next breakdown vid you do, Imma go bet some money on the fighters you side with🤣🤣 make me some money my guy💯💯💯
Sacrifice joke didn't age well.
I say Juliana Peña vs Valentina Shevchenko for the Bantamweight title next or Nunes vs Shevchenko, winner gets Peña.
Good fights last night can’t believe nunez lost
7:45 Nunes pulled out of the previous fight because of covid just like Teofimo Lopez. The Kambosos upset was epic, but Juliana Peña beating Amanda Nunes the way that she did still hurts my brain because my mind doesn’t want to accept what I saw happen.
Waiting here for your UFC 269 reaction video!! Lol
"The sacrifice"
Hate the editing on this channel. We dont need the zooming in and out and sound effects. Fire that shitty editor.
I would love to see Israel react to some Naruto scaling. The most accurate channels are: Six, Spener, SethTheProgrammer and Swagkage.
its even funnier to watch after the event
‘Eshay’ -Israel A. Legendary 👏🏾👏🏾😂😂
prescient predictions.
Predicted the kai fight perfectly lol
Also all do u probably won’t see this or care because there are so many people but could we be like real life friends
Nunez was the sacrificial lamb
Cliffs: yeah so yeah so yeah
Hey bro I just wanted to say that I admire u and that thank you for all u have done u inspire me man and for that I thank u😄
Anybody else think masked wolf- astronaut  in the ocean (1st verse) & trillville- no problems (3rd verse) are the perfect fighter walk-out songs?
Who is here after Amanda Nunez lost
Good analysis👍🇳🇱
Peña literally fucked Nunes up. Peña chocked the shit outta her 😴
The Analyses just as perfect as the clean screen! Big up Mr. ALAGIDI.
6:35 on to the sacrifice
Except for Nunes (who could ever predict that) you got all predictions right! It is amazing man! Congratz izzy, you are the best!
It's crazy cause Nunes just kept running into Pena's jab. It wasn't so much her punching power that got Nunes' attention, it was the fact that Nunes was essentially jumping chin first into a stiff arm. Very weird fight IMHO
Whose here waiting for the fight recap
Looks like nunes vs pen’a wasn’t a sacrifice 😭
Guess we were all wrong about Pena Nunes - anything can happen in this sport!
holy shit the story with cruz so fuckin funny :D
Let's go izzy! reaction video!
Hahaha Izzy is a true martial artist and knows his shit. He predicted everything right even though he lost on betting on Nunez. This is the GOAT 🐐 for a reason.
Kai is amazing, man... But this was only his second win in a row, and this is the resume in his last 5: - W (vs Garbrandt). - W (vs Bontorin). - L (vs Royval). - W (vs Nam). - L (vs Moreno). The EXACT SAME as Alexandre Pantoja. They were going to give Alexandre the shot (got injured) as he has a victory over Brandon Moreno, but the guy who truly deserves the title shot is Askarov. Flyweight isn't as as shallow as it used to be... If Kara France really wants that shot, he has to beat either Pantoja or Askarov.  (Don't get me wrong, I love Kai, he's definitely a contender).
That Amanda vs Peña prediction was rite on spot. Make Amanda tired and that’s what she did 👏🏽👏🏽 “Almost impossible” but still possible.
"Actually I gotta take a shit, hold on"  I didn't see that coming in the middle of the explanation and it cracked me up
Thank you for the heads-up sacrifice (subliminal).
"The sacrifice" 😂 yea, ok buddy
I WOULD ADVISE JUILIANNA NOT TO STAND AND BANG.  NEK MINIT
Izzy > Chael
Are you Israel?
Kai topped off my Multi
Looking forward to the reaction  video of this fight :))))))) Couldn't be happier to be wrong
Style bender spot on about his boys
He predicted the Nunes UPSET!!!
I've never seen a breakdown so detailed and well thought of. Everything he said here was pure facts... even for the Amanda nunes fight, listen to the breakdown... just wow.
Abeg Izzy u need to dey give me hint so that I go collect small thing unto betting matter. Na beg I dey pally.
“Onto the sacrifice” bro… that aged horribly.
he saw  amanda nunes loss coming lol
Funny you use the word "inciteful" for the Cruz talk. It seems MANY people in the MMA world believe he is one of the MOST inciteful/knowledgeable people in all of MMA (fighting, commentating, coaching or otherwise.).
Izzy sabi this prediction thing
Just came to say I can’t wait for the reaction 😭🤣☝🏾
Dude you rock!
so glad i called nunez pena being an upset made me quite a bit of munny!
And then Kai knocked his ass out
Tai better pay Daniel Ricciardo some royalties for that Shoey
Nah Izzy do you do juju or what how are you predicting these fights and they are true
This dude predictions lol on hahaha he right about karr vs cody lol
Izzy is the Whittaker fight on or na?
Dude predicted nunes fight
Haha the other guy said "Dan Hardy"
Peña won 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Got everything right except Amanda
Box jake Paul
damn u r completely right. pena did what u said.
Joooooo, thx for the tipp made a lot of money because of you! Bye Bye Cody 😬
can’t wait for the nunez knockout reaction
Is that what u meant by the sacrifice? That fight looked fake and she was way too happy to lose
I made serious bank taking you betting advise champ! Thanks!!!
Coming from kai’s fight against Cody. Man was spot on about the durability of the chin when dropping down a weightclass. Beautiful insights by the champ.
i missed the easy money not watching the k france prediction before it happened
Izzy was right on the money . Watching that Kai fight I was just amazed
Watch one piece
Made $75 on France!
Thanks for the call outs
bet on Kai cause of what you said... thanks for that my dude 🙏🏻
And you've done it again... Predicted Cody vs Kai fight. Insane.
Just like you predict it Izzy. Respect 🙏 bruh mi. Kai TKO Cody
UFC 269 hot sauce vs olives!
Knowing that izzy blazes up makes him even more likeable
Love your videos izzy !
Imagine being a professional fighter and looking as floppy as the first match he reviewed 🤣🤣🤣
Thanks for the picks 😭🔥
🐐
Goat 🐐  izzy
Vitori picture when he said I got to take a shit! 🤣🤣 You a asshole  for that one. Lol!
Alex poatam🇧🇷👻🏅
You never gave ur prediction tho for the main event
I need a like from the style bender his self 🙏🏾
I love Izi but he is shit in general fighting culture hahahahaha
Is this his official channel?because bro this guy  is legit one of my most favorite people in this world he’s such an awesome athlete as well as an amazing individual keep up the great work fr and love your insight on the other fighters in the sport
Vou mandar voz de prisão para você adesanya pois não está pagando suas pensões ao Paulo Costa , na hora de fazer a criança foi fácil , trate de pagar as pensões em atraso .
Go Oliveira
Well said.
Izzy is my ace but all he did was pick his teammates and people he likes better lol
UFC doesn't want Charles to win. They want a English speaking champ to promote hints why he is the favorite. Charles going to sub him in the 3rd
"I'm not sure what belt he has."  - "Black belt."  "Black belt? Yeah just don't go to the ground with him. He's slick."  Just goes to show that there are levels to jiu jitsu, and Charles is one of the best. I hope Dustin wins though.
Someone tell DC that Cruz shows up to meetings high
Doc strange ; Let put some spell and look  the future . 1.porier by tko 2.amanda  by tko. 🤔
Loved the triggered SJW meme getting tossed in lmaooo
It’s okay Izzy my Naruto funko broke too
Walk outs to knock outs
Hey izzy y dafuq did u start a channel just recently. Ur breakdowns are the best out there. Fckin awesome bruh
Bonjour
Bro how u gonna break down fights and be like "idk what this guy is about" wtf. I'm going to full reptile
Guys from the same friend circle/country will never predict against their friend.. that's how it works....😂😂😂  loyalty.. even if your mates from flyweight fights the heavyweight champ... Not saying Tai Tuivasa won't win . It's what it is ..
As, incite full the conversation was with Dom.C.Don’t ya think he was being very defensive as to what DC had to say or what was Dom.C saying to back himself, reasonable enough.
Many Brazilians in this event, including two champions (three belts altogether) 🙂🇧🇷
Engage on top.
AND PONZINIBBIO VS NEAL?????
Im thinking charles 1st or 2nd round finish.
👍
I absolutely love Amanda Nunes but it's such a shame that she can't find any real competition. Pena for instance has lost 2 of her last 4 and she's getting a title shot. And it's not like her wins were impressive either. But the lioness gotta feed her pride I guess.  With Dustin vs Oliviera I'm slightly leaning Poirier. I think Dustins high dynamism, fight IQ and expert pressuring is going to edge out a victory. That being said all Oliveira need is 1 mistake from Poirier and it's rubba dubba sub time.
Izzy is funny as fuck and the editing on this is just craaazzzyyy good🤣🤣🤣
Dom Cruz n Izzy blazing together!? Daaaaamn lol
Is so great Israel breaks down dustine he over threw but everybody stand different
V
adesanya that was me the weird asian guy asking if that was adesanya in town
Listening to an extreme narcissist's commentary is pretty cringy.
All Izzy's pick been terrible this year when picking his team mates
The fact Izzy an Sean both recognise eachothers strength an support eachother , Real recognise real 💯💯💯
Weird breakdown haha "I don't know this other guy so this guy will win" hahahahaha
So did Izzy pick charles or Dustin? Lol
Keeping it real.
Crazy how Izzy seems so humble and chill at the same time literally being a champ
As an Israel Adesanya fan, he needs to keep an eye on Jordan Wright. New threat in the middleweight division.
Askar Askarov deserves the title shot. Not Kai. Even if he beats Cody.
How is Sean O'Malley facing yet another low level, unknown guy? He is getting paid to fight guys that aren't even ranked at all. They fed Edmen Shabazayan, Wonderboy, and other new fighters a solid pack of wolves. O'Malley is super lucky to be able to take his career slowly. He should just retire before fighting any wars, because he doesn't even need to be a title holder to be super wealthy.
Wtf u didn't pick fr the main event
“Actually, yeah, I’m gonna take a shit hold on “ 😂😂
I say easy night for Amanda and Charles
Izzy the Gyno bender!!!
Izzy played dumb like hooker didn’t get smoked salmon
The intermission picture is crazy! 😂😂😂😂
He didn’t say who he’d think would win between Charles and Dustin
no josh emmett vs dan ige?
I can’t get tired of watching Greg hardy get dropped
Style bender is so arrogant instead of saying we've fought on the same card he says....he's fought on my card I think. Hilarious. Between the humping of Costa and verb like this, he's in Conor's class. Of no class. Just remember....this will all be over soon and there's no sequel.....Ricky Gervase
Oliveira is gonna beat Dustin by stoppage. Maybe guillotine or a triangle armbar.
He has a fake accent
Who wants to be a fan of such a nerd..
This guy is the king of cringe
Cringe bender
This was a really bad breakdown..you might as well have picked a guy off of the street and have him point at the person he thinks will win. 🤣🤣 I mean, c'mon man..if you're gonna pick fights at least do a little research.
hell yeah i fuck with this i got olivera and nunez of course brazil taking it home tomorrow
love the vids bro most dope ufc fighter
How can you breakdown fights if you don't know anything about the fighters 🤣
Hey Issy u forgot to mention Josh emmett v Dan ige
I don't agree with everything Izzy says...but i respect everything he says. Few and far between in MMA.
Hahah that’s what I said here we go again another sacrifice for Amanda🤦🏻‍♂️
Thanks for the videos hoss 🦾🚶
Didn’t get your pick for the Poirier Vs Olives fight? Who you got??
1:40 Cody "Only Hooks" Garbrandt
Broo! You don’t advertise your channel enough i just came across this randomly!!!! I love it!!!
What about Ponzinibbio vs Neal? Come on...
Tuivasi got the best abs in ufc.
Pena might just might get it done in round 4, if she goes into the clinch and take nunes down and has the life out of her and then only in round 4 go for a solid submission attempt. In round 1-3 she should look for oppotunities but round 4 she should push for a sub
This dude is so cringe. Fight Jon Jones so he can knock your jaw off your head and you can’t talk anymore.
Poirier wins, I think
I jizapruv 🤣
This dude should fight
sheeeeeeeeeesh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stylebender you the truth bro. Can’t wait to see your next fight. Is it officially the Rob rematch?
probably askar askarov and alexandre pantoja are deserving more the title shot, no disrespect to kai but beating Garbrandt winning 1 of the last 4 is not going to give him the title shot.
Does everybody just forget about Neal vs Ponzinibbio? That’s a banger! Got Charles/Amanda/Ponzinibbio/O’Malley/Cody/Cruz/Tuivasa
3:35  Cruz smoking weed before a meeting.   Meanwhile, he was going at that ref for smelling like cigarettes and alcohol.
oh so your a youtuber now
What’s the game plan for Kai …I don’t think he goes to the ground with Cody…best chance is on the feet but he is going to be a lot smaller than Cody ….Tell us bro clearly you know something
Garbrandt and intelligence? 😂😂 please guy's a moron and always let's his emotions take over
Remember the Poirier - Holloway fight ?  Dustin over-threw so many crazy looping uppercut bomb attempts.
I lost it at the first "I jizzaprove"  Keep this channel rolling forever dude
Bender style 👏
What up with izzy right tit
“On to the sacrifice” 🤣🤣🤣
no way... subbed right away
dustin ain't gonna win this
Never go full garbrandt
“Now to the sacrifice” 😂
You can tell that Izzy does his homework for these fights  …. Said no one ever
Tai ko Hardy was such a surprise.
2:11 Marvin 'Uruk Hai' Vettori
I jizzaprove 100%
This kid got more subs than most influencers tryna make a youtube career Stylebender different  kids on another level he in a diff class
he didnt say who wins between poirier and oliveira
cody is going to knock your boy the fuck out
Always a great breakdown! I couldn't tell who Izzy picked in the main event though? He likes them both?
Love ufc from indonesia fighter
You are from God, little children, and you have defeated these people because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world." — 1 John 4:4
The Roblox sound when Cody got dropped 😂
Justin will be champ after this
saving my verdict account
the moment when adesanya still hated dustin's style @ 9:35
Izzy picks are always wrong 😂😂 favour  his pals no actual research.  Don't bet what he says tai will probs lose and many others that he said 😂 don't bet his picks.
what's the name of this youtuber?
So are you not going to pick between Charles and Dustin?
Who's Sean's next opponent a tomato can?
Israel is thoughtful men.
Ahahahah what a joke. He didnt breakdown shit he just pointed out the most obvious facts about the fighters everyone knows
Same joker time, channel..🤷🏼‍♂️🙄
Except from fighting, you have another thing in common with Cruz. He likes also fast cars. I would like to see the 720s against his Godzilla.
These guys are to funny every video always has me cracking up 😂
Exactly - I feel like Dustin has been improving almost the fastest/best in the UFC. Almost every year hes better and better.. Love to see that work ethic :)
i really think munoz and cruz is the best match up for eatchother. i feel like they are very similar in certain ways. should be an amazing fight
Grande  campeon
Bummer. No main event prediction.
Oliveira and Poirier is what I’ve been waiting for  I want Oliveria to remain champion just like i wanted Israel to remain champion  You put in a lot of work for it from what I seen  But in the ufc someone always has to take a lose so idk we’ll see when time comes
where is Izzy streaming?
No more ads ur rich. 🤣
Never fuck with a mans ruto
I respect all fighters but I been reviewing Amandas fights and she literally wrecks all her opponents and Julianna doesnt seem to compare. Nunes does not play in my opinion.
Sean needs to join the camp/ at least work with them if/when they come to America... Guaranteed champ if he does right their
I think Poirier's grappling and wrestling is underrated. People seem to forget he almost submit Khabib who is arguably the best wrestler in UFC history.
Eshhaayyyy
Stylebender I see what you're brother did there when he quipped the following; "so Cruz went to work high"? Lolol! That was subtle but really, really funny my dude! All the best for y'all! Peace.
Sean o malley ez.. He should fight a top 15 or 10..that will be much more interesting to watch
"Actually I'm gonna take a shit hold on... *explicit sound*…" Israel Adesanya.
Man best part of my day smoking my bong on the porch vibing with the champ doesn't get any better then this
This is awesome Israel , happy you are making these videos and sharing your fighting knowledge. Just found this channel ! keep it up bro
I laughed too fucking hard at the “on to the sacrifice” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Israel “I don’t know anything about him” Adesanya
On to the sacrifice 😂😂😂😂
That Dan Hardy KO tho
Plunging and dashing punches will be bad for Dustin amd that’s what he does against opponents taller than him. Oliveira is veeery sneaky
https://youtu.be/XCIZmw30xOM ,,,,,
what about ponzinibbio vs neal? :c
what hapend with ponzinibbio vs neal prediction?
Keep up the good work Champ 👍
8:26 Justin Gaethje ?  Lol
kai straight title shot ? His number 6 now chill bro.
0:14 lol
I'd love to hear you answer more of your brothers questions like at 01:50 in this video, since in those conversations he's kinda like the 'casual' asking the questions we want to know the answers to regarding the fight game.
No place for Pena. Pena got submitted by Germaine de randamie
The fight I'm most excited for is Dustin Poirier  vs Charles Oliveira, now thats going to be fight of the night.
Man...plz lend me some money...I want to do betting...once I win a lot I will return u all ur momey
I think Oliviera vs Porier is like the perfect hero vs hero in a fantasy game.  Oliviera -Strenghts- Slick Technical Extremley good BJJ -Weakness- Quits if hurt No championship experience Weaker  Dustin -Strenghts- War proven Durability Solid stand up and GnP Brawler  Strong chin  -Weakness- Oliviera's BJJ Less technical  Lmao
Lmfao now for the sacrifice
In what universe is Cody 5'8" ?
What about ponzinibbio????
somebody besides youtube should also be paying you for your picks…cough cough draftkings!
the vettori cameo got me dying haaaa
Kai the bully beat down Bro any day
smh@ cruz showing up to work smelling like weed but being mad at no nonsense peterson
I disapproved in Costa voice was so funny😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Idk why but the his voice is always really low coming in on my phone speakers
2:11
Story Story
Your vids are too quite can pls bump the audio a tad
Adesanya: I don't know what kind of belt Dustin has... Dude: Black belt. Adesanya: Black belt? Yeah, don't go to the ground.  LoL!
His breakdowns are the best but his brother in the background makes these videos twice as good 😂🙏🏽
Love from India
Charles has very good takedowns. The fact that he has the option to go for the takedown gives him so many more possibilities and this aspect also affects how Dustin must approach the striking. Luckily for Dustin he fought Khabib, so this is not completely new territory for him, he has something to build upon.
Charles Oliveira By Submission 2 / 3 rd Round
Sup Israel big fan bro u a savage in that octagon
izzy running to a mil subs
What do you think of Tony Ferguson?
Love the content champ 💯
skip this bs video he don't even predict the main event fight
React to glory Colission 3 Rico vs Jamal pls
Costa’s disapprove killed me🤣🤣
yooooo I've been living under a rock and didn't know Isy was on yt dayum
I'm so excited for this. so many great fights on this card. Dustin is my fav so I'm praying for Dustin! He deserves the belt ! I do also really like Charles and respect him. Dont want either to lose but I'm going with Dustin because hes my fav fighter!
my heart is telling me oliveira
Story Story… Storryyyyy 🤣🤣🤣 I love it, your the best man.. keep up the good work Champ 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
1:44 ohhhh
I disapprove.lol
"Sometimes its hard" - Celine Deon
Dominick Cruz doesn't move the way he use to
I jizzaprouve
Wassup Izzy! Huge fan!  Im 24 yrs old, training myself at home, but i mostly only know how to train boxing and would realllyyyyyy appreciate a kickboxing / muay thai beginner vid from you!  Much love from Canada, keep killing it, Rock Lee should be the protagonist, dont @ me.
Lol the “I disapprove” @0:15 sent me🤣🤣🤣
lol ty is a proper eshay
munhoz vs cruz is gonna look like when you both chose the same fighter in UFC
Here for the Izzy and Oliveira culture
You awesome bro, and love your champ attitude. Its always great to pull up others when u are on top....big fan from Tanzania 🇹🇿
The ponzinibbio fight was skipped, bad there
51-49 Olivera by submission and Dustin by TKO or decision
SUGA SHOW most anticipated
Teach how to dance bro
Egbo always they make conversation insightful
Full Reptile, Bispings and Bender, only 3 videos I watch for upcoming fights. These three are best on youtube.
Nobody forget when Izzy told us Dan wasn't getting taken down by Islam 😂
Kai is 2-2 and man is saying he gets the next title fight for sure I’m dead.
Bro I want an opinion that isn't "I know this guy he wins"
0.15 Paulo Costa
Shit izzy!!! Let me be your joint roller
No way he had the Paulo voice over 😭😂
Issy man.. come on, there's no way beating garbrandt at this point gets you a title shot, munhoz beat him just after his first loss and got to fight fucking Aldo as a reward.. and that was in a division where he had more clout
If Kai Kara-France wins against Garbrandt, he's not getting the next title-shot. Askar Askarov is the #1 contender at 125 lbs.
Unless Kai has beat Pantoja he's not getting the next title shot
I like both of them
Hey Champ
Disrespectful to dustin how can u call dustin flat footed?
how t f is Kai 4 inches shorter but is reach is longer than Codys...))
2:10 Take a Marvin haha
ребят скажите за кого Адесанья ?
Missed signature rounded corners :)
I see you editor I see you dude [2:11] xD
It's anybody's fight, Dustin can rock Charles on the feet through his power, and Charles can stun Dustin as well on the feet through his precision in his technical striking, but once the fight hits the ground, Dustin should be very cautious there since he's very likely to be submitted, or Dustin powers through and scrambles back to his feet, resetting the fight. Either way, it's going to be one hell of a fight, or there will be a finish from one of these two warriors.
Big fan bro from Nepal
2:11 bruh
Tai has really improved since doing training with AKA
Dude Cruz is a ducking legend for helping with the spark up ✊🏽
Munoz’ last fight was with Aldo right?
cool , go kai, I kind of feel Olivera needs to win for the division . Going to be interesting.
And I look forward to your reaction video of UFC 269. Thanks
Yooooo lmfaooo “I disapprove” 😂 that’s funny as hell
🔪🇦🇷🩸
Great breakdown
The way u snuck in that lil pic of vetori😂😂
i’ve got your shin guards. thanks you Izzy 🔥🙏🏽
This breakdown is nothing compared to the one that your body will endure against THE REAPER.
Hoping to see another shoeFC....and go Kai 🙏🙏
Did he fart?🤣🤣😂😂
Everytime Izzy tells a story, that can get somebody in legal trouble   ,,Allegedly."
Definitely Oliv Vs Poir…You were too smart not to directly favors Oliviera arsenal and technical ability over Poirier’s…but definitely your general   assessment favors Oliviera and l share that with you and frankly l would bet that Oliviera will win 70% vs 30% to Dustin…l saw fear and perplexity in Dustin’s last interview something that show were the battle is going to go…
I think kai wins too, but to say he deserves a title shot after this is just ridiculous, he hasn't beaten anyone top 5 (actually he recently lost to royval too). Askarov and pantoja are much more deserving.
C’mon, the Kiwis need a win.
DAMN, Izzy just called Pena a scarifice to Nunes.
So, who was your pick in the main event, Stylebender?? It's not clear lol..
Can’t really trust the Kai pick bc they’re friends like the Hooker pick. I have Cody in this one, he’s been fighting smarter recently.
Izzy: He's Bistancial. Him: Nah I'm just stance curious.
Gonna take a shit 🤣
Can i get a year supply of tekilla kiwi please thats stuffs the shit man
Should get Eugene’s opinion coz he has Brad Riddle in his mind for the next 155 champ . Looks like fame is creeping into his mentality . He can talk about his fighters n put the opponent down but Khabib can’t . Bloody hypocritical jealous much prick . I’m more pissed that his advice made you lose your unbeaten record.
Dustin fpught with the Eagle  ,so yall know he has been to the deep waters ,went to war with the hangman,beat holloway twice !charlie is a nice guy! Olives gonna get those calf kicks n big punches d whole time!😂
Izreal Adan say a isteel banta hhhh
🔥🔥🔥
Izzzzzzzyyyyyy
so biased my guy 😂💪
what do this guy on video even know about fighting to talk ?
I think Cody should have gone up to featherweight
Good breakdown Izzy, unfortunately the world is coming to a close real soon. Our idols of Gold and Silver will all turn to rust. You already know the truth, you just haven't accepted it yet. I pray you wake before you're stuck in a world under the wrath of God's Judgement. Jesus Christ is the only way. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AuP8EpeDo8
💉💊🧬
nah... Sakai knocks out Tuivasa
We need that Stylebender merch!
what a terrible cruz story.
Told you Izzy would be the best thing smoking if he started a YouTube! Congrats champ! Proud of you in so many ways.
im feeling some imbalances in the the volume levels throughout the video, but great stuff as always
Ponzi vs neal?
this has nothin to do with the video but i think mcgregor should switch camps (or at least get more looks visiting another camp) and him going to city kickboxing would be fire
Israel the gynobender
I cannot trust Izzy when it comes to his own team mates.. He always sippin on his own Kool-Aid when it comes to that. I feel like everyone does tho. Even happened with Michael Chiesa, said that Amanda is in for a rude awakening, lol. Just not sure if Kai is such a lock in.
When you have Israel talking about his boii at 125 saying you don't want to get hit by him them that should tell you how damn hard the dude hits haha he's been in there with him so clearly he knows and if it made that much of an imapct on the way he looks at his power then clearly he hits hard af for a 125er the 125ers now are way more fun to watch because of stuff like this and man some of them pack a damn punch lol
Man been waiting for this card for awhile! Love both buys in the main an will suck for either to lose but I’m riding with Dustin on this one. We got to see an emotional awesome championship win from Charles already so now I wanna see the veteran Dustin get the belt! If Cody loses this fight then his career is not looking good. He may even join Kevin Lee in no mans land. Pumped to see Suga fight, hopefully he has another stand out performance against Paiva. I feel like Pena has the better chance against Amanda with her wrestling then the last couple opponents. But I’m sure Nunes will drop her like the rest!
Still waiting on the reaction video for that first round L your boy Hooker took on his last fight. Dont do us like that izzy! We need that breakdown
youtube algo
8:00 The reach for both women.......... 69", noice.
He’s really goin hard on the videos
Dustin has good power a great chin, great takedown defense and is a black belt in bjj. I have Dustin winning using that dog he has in him.
Yo. StyleBender was dope in “Baki Hanma”! They showed respect and didn’t let Yujiro kick his ass. They let Mike Tyson get trampled lol. People sleep on Baki. 💪🏾
Oliveira is the more talented fighter in every category, but Poirier has game-changing power and an unusual ability to recover from damaging shots.
let's go crypto Champ but the Bronx submits The diamond and humbles him again
I got Sakai beating tai
0:13 : Costa 'I jizzaprove' 6:36 - On to the sacrifice - f'in savage lmaooooo
Olivera for sure W
Yo before i clicked on this i said the same thing about "the sacrafice"
Munhoz last fight he lost vs Aldo. Aldo was on one that night 💪
I jizzapprove, hundrepercent.
Pedro’s fought about 4 times since the Cody fight but ah well 😂
Pantoja submits kai
where is your clown of a coach?
Subtitle Indonesia 🙏🙏
My Men You forget about PonIzinibbio vs Geoff!!
did he just say eshay?...
Codys hangin with the boyyyzzzz
💡🙏🤷 Great assessment Champ I agree with all your picks except Cody I have to pull for him because I want him to find success in his true weight class 👊🏻
Can Nunes ever fight Valentina?
"i deesapproove" 🤣
Cruz the fucking man
Even Izzy doesn't know who tf is gonna win the main event 😂😂 this is one of those fights were we have no idea who's gonna win and is both guys at the best they've ever been that's why it's so interesting 🔥🔥
BRUUUUUH. So good when you get home after a fucker of a day at work and see Izzy posted. Loving the youtube content champ. Keep it up
Do you still fight or just make videos
Olivera by Sub!
The champ💪
🔥🔥🔥🔥
1 Million subscribers soon brooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I compare sugas striking to Izzys. They’re both out there having fun and being creative. They’re artistic in the stand up. I would expect them to be fans of each other. Obviously Izzy is the superior fighter right now, but those are the two guys I’m locked in with when they’re on a card.
Wtf izzy, you skip Ponzinibbio fight, heartbroke from Argentina 💔🇦🇷
Pena's been talking *a lot* of noise. That poor woman's going to get hurt.
👑👊🔥
You Should Run For President!
lmfao the vettori edit when he went to shit
"Idk what kind of belt Dustin has" "Black belt" "Don't go to the ground with Oliveira" 😂😂
whenever Izzy bets on his teammate, always bet on their opponent. thats what i've been doing the last 3 fights for CKB. thanks izzy
Dustin is a Louisiana baby so I gotta go for him we all show love down here
For real, I think skill for skill Oliveira is the best in the entire UFC. But sometimes it’s more about how you chain those skills together or how well you can use them under pressure. Chucky Olives has never been into the championship rounds in his entire career.
i bet it was something about fuck monster energy
Tuivasa V Sakai is going to be great.  Both guys throw bombs even when they’re dead tired.
*oliveira via unanimous decision*  I bet 420 on it
He’s so biased. Pantoja and askarov are ahead of Kara France for title shot
Yoooo lol Dominick Cruz just got a lil bit cooler to me. Lol I’m sure he don’t want no one to know he took a hit 😂 but it’s all good
When Dominick Cruz was on, he was the man. Him vs TJ was a great fight, I think that was his last big performance with the footwork but now I think injuries and age have slowed down his movement a bit
0:59 😂😂 ESHAY
Ez win for Dustin
I love how the UFC doesn't hate on the fighters who smoke weed, they used to, but not anymore
Dwl I jishaprove
Fighhhttt cammmop
let's goooo oliveiraa💯👑🇧🇷🇧🇷🔮
He’s gonna beat Whittaker with those big Nigerian 🏀’s.
Y la predicción de Ponzinibbio??
I disapruve
So what was his official pick for the main event? Lol
That’d be awesome to roast one with those two 😂
Olivera is the better fighter overall
Charles Oliveira!!!
lol dom cruz is a gangster
You didn’t predict who wins Oliviera vs Porier.
Get excited for your videos 🙏 Anzac up
I think Dustin beats you at boxing 🥊
If Izzy ever one day no longer were the champion, I hope he keeps making these amazing videos regardless. Huge fan of his fights but also the content and overall personality 🤯
That episode with Brad was tuff. You're a good friend, Champ 🙏 Great breakdown, as always. You could've used the hair of the🍻🍷 🐶🐕 this day 😉 But still on point 👍 I got O'MALLEY, Dustin, going for J. Pena! Rooting for Dom, as well.
0:14 killing me already
On to the sacrifice 💀
Nice one. Let's go Kai.
The Green Dragon has spoken
You need to fight Khamzat Chimaev and if you win you will expose everyone
Daddy izzy
🔪⚰️🪦
izzy send me adress so i can send you cristmas present man :D
"He fought on my card before" vs "we fought on the same card before"  And he says other people have egos.
And still!! 🇧🇷
Kai by ko Cruz by dec  Bambam by ko Dustin by ko #easy money lessshgo
Love it
Izzys breakdowns r the last ones i watch before locking in my bets. His wisdom is unparalleled. Hopefully he’s still around when i get in the ufc
Yea imo Charles has somewhat gotten over quitting in fights. I had him beating chandler unless he was dropped or hit hard because that’s when he usually freezes up. Abs he did and I thought his confidence would go away but he did a complete 360. Which 100% means he’s improved in that area
Buowot
Izzy Death Note Stylebender 🐉📝
WHEN YOUR ONLY REACTION MISSING IS THE FIGHT DAN GOT SMASHED ON BY ISLAM 🤣🤣🤣 IZZY THE COWARD ONLY COMES OUT WHEN HE LOOKS RIGHT AND GOOD FUCKING BUM
WE WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE REACTION TO DAN GETTING SMASHED BY ISLAM WHEN U SAID DAN WOULD WIN 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 FUCK IZZY U R A COWARD
The martial arts will be on full display brotha
I hope when stylebender retires he becomes an analyst. Dude has one of the best minds in the game fr.
Battle of the pregnant dog stomachs
Tai vs Sakai, battle of the disgusting stomachs
😂😂😄🤦🏽‍♂️ Izzy's right about Nunes vs Pena. Truly, it's a sacrifice o. Don't see that fight lasting more than 2 rounds to be honest. The only fight that can make sense for Nunes is Valentina vs Nunes 3 since the wnd fight was split decision
Yea he a snitch
Munhoz last fought frankie edgar I thot
It doesn't matter what color belt you are. Don't go to the ground with Oliveira!
Munhoz and Font are near the same power lvl and Aldo and Cruz were fed these opponents just to put them back on the winning column. Cruz is supposed to win. Lets face it- Aldo and Cruz won't be champs again. They are gatekeepers that will eventually lose and put shine on some up-&-Comers record. I'd like to see Aldo vs Cruz but I doubt that fight will ever happen.
Nunes is a man everything on her body, voice, act, style, she has a wife so 😂
LETS GO KAI
If anyone could beat nunes it would be Pena her hands r not bad at all she def can strike with her
how are people so lazy or inconsiderate not to click the like button...it takes no effort...
lol garbrandt has glass chin
When the audio clip in the very beginning said "I jizapprove..." I finished it by saying "hundred percennnnn" out loud* to my phone ffs. 🤣✌️
That Paulo costa’s “I disapprove” shit was hilarious 0:14
So Hyped to watch O'malley fight. Win or lose, I love watching that dude compete and do his thing.
Cody is intelligent?
Let's go 100 I.Q ufc fight break downs 🔥
stylebender, i love you so much bro but please do some more research before you give out analysis...you prefacing your analysis with "i dont know much about xoxo" is really not helpful , if anything its hurtful lol
I want both guys to win in the main event!
ty
ESSHHAAAY
Hello style Bender like your show like how you fight I'm just an old white guy but I like you a lot pretty cool
Guys does anyone know when the broken native shirt will be added back to the store?
KAI KARA FRANCE GOT THIS . PINNNNEEED
Wow
"The Sacrifice"
Cruz blazing with Izzy is a great story
I think you are bad  predictable with experience But a great fighter
What I like about this one: 1. "Story, story!" and 2. the fact that you didn't pick a winner in the Charlie Olives/Diamond Poirier fight... The sponsor ad was tastefully done, too; long enough for us to get the details, witjout being TOO long.😎 Cheers to you, your brother, and the crew!👍🏾
IDK about all the immediate title shot talk for Kai, Askarov &  Pantoja are ahead of him in my mind and he lost to Royval just two fights ago.
Don't sleep on Dom Cruz
Smoking a J💨💨💨💨 with Izzy up there on my bucket list
Oliveira in the 2nd by rear naked choke
If you're a betting Man always bet on Black........I mean The FREESTYLEBENDER!!!
Always onpoint 🔥
Love the content bro
horrible breakdown
The reaper is coming
Cody going flyweight is a bad decision in my opinion
2:11 ahhahaaha
Love bro bro!
Bro i love izzy he's so relatable and hilarious
Did he pic Oliveira???
Oliveras last loss was back in 2017 ...
How am I only coming across this channel????? #mifted #bouttym
Munoz last fight was with Aldo my brother
Your teams been getting lit up lately lol
I haven't been keeping up with this fight aside from looking forward to the main event, so I didn't realize that this card is STACKED
I think people are underestimating Kai (not you, obviously), but Kai's gonna sleep Cody in under 1 min
Ay style bender I got Cody ko what’s up.thousand in it
1:27 Munhoz his last fight was against Aldo and he lost that fight.
Sean gets KOd that sleep meme is already ready.
🇧🇷
How is the gyno Izzy. .? Letrozol is what you need.
I remember a time when floyd ducked pacman for nearly five whole years and only fought him when he knew pacman was past his prime and had an injury.
Omg now that Cruz pocket-burger story makes so much sense 😂 🤣
Thanks for posting even during that tough ass week your team went through
love the video, but munhoz last fight was against aldo
6:39 lmao sorry not sorry 🤷‍♂️
That Cruz story is actually mad hahah
Diarrhea fart at 2:10
Wonder how he'd break down himself against Khamzat.
Story story
Tuivasa vs Sakai is gonna be a banger. Been following both for a while and I think they’re both going to have a good career
Awesome breakdown Champ! I got Pedro Munhoz edging a decision (maybe even split) over Dom Cruz in a competitive bout Kai Kara France stops Cody Garbrandt in round 2 with a two punch combo and some follow up ground strikes (just what I envision in my head don’t ask questions) (Going out of order oops) O’Malley I’m not sure, I think he either picks up a TKO in the third (he likes to play with his food I feel) or a landslide decision. Nunes stops Pena in the first round… idek how just a stoppage. Poirier gets the nod over Oliveira in the main event. Charles has proven to be hittable in the Chandler fight. Poirier is a veteran as you said, when he hurts guys he often puts them away. Very few men have been stunned by Poirier and survived the flurry that follows (your boy Dan Hooker is one of the few who have done this, and of course Blessed). Finally I have Tai Tuivasa by rolling knee bar 0:10 into the first round, truly one of the best grapplers of our era.
Imagine walking past a car park and just seeing Isreal Adesanya passing a j with Dominck Cruz
that hooker porier fight was so gangster lol.  cant get over it like a year and a half later.
This card is gonna be wild! We’re in for a treat boys
"On to the sacrifice" had me dead 😂😂😂
Dustin wins
I feel like nunes will lose, I think she has become softer since she became a mom.
People keep talking about Charles submission game and Dustins striking... but why is no one talking about the wrestling? Poirier has some of the worst take down defence in the UFC and Charles took down Chandler with ease (one of the top wrestlers)..  I see Charles dominating him similar to Khabib.
LEESSGOOO KAI!
"I jizzaprove" 🍷  Lmao
They both deserve this, but no matter who wins they're still both greats.
“onto the sacrifice” 😭😭 i love izzy man
🤣🤣
Dustin gonna knock him down in round 3
Go on Style!! Keep cementing your place in the sport as one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time! Peace and Love brother will keep following you.
2:09 lmao💀
Tui and Sakai are like the same fighter, before I see the flags. They ufc careers seem similar 🤔
"On to the sacrifice" that's cold man😂
Appreciate the breakdown Izzy, you can’t get this type of breakdown in any other sport.  Betting Oliveira, Kara France, and Cruz  LFG
Dustin 100%
That Costa voice insert🤣...you're wrong for that😭.
I loved that Cruz story.. keep these videos coming IZZY!!!! We love the content
It’s timee
Izzy gonna be smoked against Whittaker this time , becareful izzy, this gonna happen with you ,👉  https://youtu.be/ApvxOW-v754
I got Dustin. Let's gooooooo!
Safe to say, the prediction Izzy chooses is more than likely to win based off all his other prediction videos.
I can’t believe this is still three days away. Been feeling like an entire year has past in the lead up
i disapprove 100% 0:14
I dizzaprove
Izzy, how dare you give us the predictions for every fight, but the main event... 😭😭
Appreciate you
Nunes v Shevchenko 2 was a robbery. Shevchenko stopped Nunes.
I don't believe anything Izzy says about his teammates, it's all sugar coated.
Story story
I don't understand how Kai is such a big underdog, but I'm not complaining cause I'm cashing in on it
Sacrifice! 😆 🤣 😂 😹  I keep saying that about Amanda's and Valentina's challengers.
W
Oliveira by sub in first or second round 👍
6:35 wait ur not wrong
Return of The Suga Show
Huge fan of your social media work! New levels of interaction with ufc Audience are being shown! New generation champ!
This guy is really good at breaking down fights, wonder if he ever considered to be a fighter
1:45 😭😭
We need another fight breakdown Izzy!
i fuck with both dustin and olivera but since everyone is doubting olivera for his past even though he's proved he's changed, i want him to win so badly now just as a fuck you to all the the doubters. Still fuck with dustin tho and wouldn't be mad if he won
I'm going to open small gym as a purple belt. Realized if I want to train more and live the life I should just go after it and live the life.
Charles Oliviera for the win, via rear naked choke or heel hook
I feel olivera gonna win
JEEZ over half a million subs already killing the youtube game
That was the 3rd times Cody got ko'ed with same manner, twice with tj. lmao.
Stylebender, Are you gay as I never see Hot Women with you, only Fat Guys, Big $$$ usually brings Hot Women? Watching fights with Fat Guys does not seem like much Fun?
Needs more sound bites from Costa. "I disapprove" ahahah

I dizzaprove 😂
Lol Cruz covering Izzy to light up his joint is the most Dominic thing I ever heard. Ps sorry for your friends lost, its great to see that you care for him.
People always forget Tuivasas real strength, which is his immune system that has been strengthened by drinking from so many different peoples shoes
Let's gooo Kai 🤙🏼
Izzy is the best I admire you a lot
