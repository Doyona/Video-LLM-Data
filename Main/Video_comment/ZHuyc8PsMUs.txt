Gosh I didn't recognize Timothy Dalton as the Supermarket Owner
I feel like American Harry Potter is probably Percy Jackson? Same heros journey, just set in America
Nothing will convince me this isn't the best movie ever.
Steve Coogan is a national treasure, if you've not seen Alan Partridge.... you're in for a real treat!
Wow the "traffic collision" line callback actually blew me away
Technically it still is “cop”, in London when the first police force was created they were nicknamed coppers
What's with the 'swords on the wall'. What's the callback?
Americas harry potter: The Office
Would Americas Harry Potter be Star Wars?
Why would the actors playing the Andes have to take up smoking?  Couldn't they use fake cigarettes?  Unless they didn't mind taking up smoking.
It took me a couple of times before I got into it, but when I did it became one of my favorites.
As someone who lives in the british countryside, I’m bot sure if it’s a good or bad thing that I can understand the old farmer
5:15 forgot to add, most with, so another win off. I READ THE SUBTITLES
1:31 typo here forgot of the dead so I'm taking a win off and that's what I'll do on here where on the other channels I add a sin
Love the pic of you and your kid.
Of cors everything is great with Hot Fuzz,All British cast and no yanks in sight,We are so much better than the yanks in every way.I wouldn’t mind this channel if the Narrator wasn’t such a wanker.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💪
Wait, is this a coincidence that the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance, an organisation who goes against the Fuzz later in the movie, when abbreviated, shares a name with the rap group mainly known for disrespecting the police? Knowing it's Edgar Wright, probably not. Just makes you appreciate the movie more, huh
Nicholas Angel is named after Nick Angel who composed the music for this film.
“Cop” as a term actually originated in britain
Did you notice Olivia Colman-Oscar winner-as a bit part police woen in the back ground?
“You’re off the fu****g chain!” Is one of the best quotes in cinematic history
The town Sandford is actually a fictional town used as a police training exercise to investigate murder.  Also I was in Wells when they were filming this movie and met Simon at the film premiere. I still have the complimentary mirrored aviator sunglasses we all got for going!
I didnt think you would have a manly face with such a squeaky voice...from the ear buds advert.
legal drinking age in UK is 18 unlike America which is 21 hence more adolescents in the pub.
1:57 Shaun of the dead-esque blood hand..oh and I bought my Japanese peace Lily cos of this scene 2:28 *true story.
0:40 but it's not literally the shot from this scene. The ID background is blue/grey, liek I'd expect inside a police station and the movie background is light coming through a stairwell. He has the same expression, but it isn't the same shot. Maybe metaphorically, but not literally.
Shaun of the dead waaaay better
Tiny detail I never noticed until this video, there's a sketch figure on the wall behind the Andy's at 15:03, which is a reference to Skinner saying within the scene that many people in the town hold multiple jobs, including himself, who hosts a 'life drawing class'. So props to the production design (pun unintended) for reinforcing that dialogue with the scenery!
Almost a perfect movie as far as I am concerned.
Sorry about the 2-year-old comment here, but I just found this and had to thank you for your insight. You pointed out some things I didn't notice after watching this over 50 times! I loved the headless tailor's dummy. This is a win!
im so confused as to why this video has been re uploaded
This is an immensely funny film, so you think it might make sense to not talk over the whole damn thing?
How do you mention The Hound but not Walder Fray?  / Hogwarts custodian??
the Only perfect movie.
One great win you missed at 8:14. Right before Sergeant Angel scaled the fence, he said "What's up Danny, you've never taken a shortcut before?". The exact same line was said in Shaun of the Dead when he scaled the fence and the compositions of the shot were near identical across the two movies.
A lot of these same actors were in Black Books as well, Dylan Moran's "David from shaun of the dead" show from way back. Honestly the lot of em are great.
“Cops” is a term England actually created. Robert Peel created the Metropolitan police in England. (Hence why, in Ireland, the police are known as “Peelers”).   The badges were made out of…any guesses?  That’s right! Copper! Hence the term.   Also the same reason the police  (MFP) in Mad Max were known as “The Bronze”.
The cornetto trilogy is literally art.
The word Cop was invented in Britain. It's an abbreviation of Copper. Most Brits would say Coppers instead of Cops.
Hot Fuzz is my favourite movie, I can watch this movie for hours on end and not get bored
Dang it, you've missed Danny's flipbook cartoon!
My single favourite movie of all time. Watched it (not even kidding) well over 100 times probably. Don't judge me 😆
America's Harry Potter is school shootings
america's harry potter is narnia...
8:24 at this scene Danny awkwardly looks back because Edgar told him that if he doesn't audience would believe he did the stunt by himself.
8:50 Churches are always the tallest building in villages and even some towns in the UK so thats not really suprising/interesting.
Its wild you can immediately tell its Cate Blanchett even with her face covered 😆 hell I recognized her before she talked
Your kid clearly taking advantage of "make lots of noise" made my whole day 😂
The best part of Hot Fuzz was it featured Simon Pegg before he outed himself as a lefty woketard. A degenerate simp of a man, I wouldnt piss on him even if he were on fire.
The American equivalent of Harry Potter is either Percy Jackson or American pie
@ 5:34 - no they get the anakin treatment instead
12:31 also its cute that you think Harry Potter is a North American movie. =]
I have to watch this at 1.25 speed, but then it messes up the video snip. Please speak faster like the Sins guyyyy <3
Your raycon, match cut,  sequence was adorable 😍 makes me miss my kids 😊
Americas Harry Potter...is Star Wars.
Farmer is not incomprehensible, that’s a genuine Somerset accent
This movie is the gold standard for cinema wins! Almost every scene, every line of dialogue, every transition, has some sort of hidden detail or foreshadowing. I've probably seen it ten times in my life and am always finding new lines that foreshadow something later in the movie.   Truly a work of genius that I recommend to everyone (who can handle the gore).
"which one do you think I will like" *DID I SAY WE ARE ONLY WATCHING ONE*
more like everything great about simon pegg and nick frost!! these 2 guys are beauties to see in films together. at worlds end was pretty good  too! they need more movies together or more movies !
I was today years old when I realized the incomprehensible old man was Filch.
Also, skipping getting stabbed by Peter Jackson?
The term “Cop” actually originated in Victorian London. It referred to the copper buttons police would wear on their uniforms
America's Harry Potter?:  We Need To Talk About Kevin
Just as a point of order, "cop" comes from "copper", a British term from the 18th century.
The first scene is filmed at the huge police college in Hendon, North West London, minutes away from where I grew up, went to school and moved back to.
Hot Fuzz deserves all the wins
Did everyone miss that “The Equalizer”(Edward Woodward) was there too? Or do I just need to read more comments?  The dude that monitors the screens and dies by the mine explosion.
One thing that's interesting to note is the fact that Sergeant Angel's forgotten notepad censoring also keeps the audience from learning Cousin Sissy's gender. One would imagine she would have completed her thought that Sissy could "go f*** HIMself"
2nd Cornetto trilogy! Love it!!! I remember buying  DVD for it to keep this movie on tap lol
I love the callbacks. The fairground. When Angel is at the gun stall he’s told ‘ Take out the little men and waltz off with the cuddly monkey’ That’s  Angel at the end of the movie. Danny is his chunky monkey, a callback to Shaun when Nick Frost does Clyde.
THE GREATER GOOD
Other things I noticed about Skinner.  1. When driving past the burned down house, a song about fire is playing on his radio  2. It’s funny how he is a parody Bond villain, given that Timothy Dalton played Bond for two films
Fingered up the duck pond
One of the few videos in youtube where the product promoted is made to look relevant to the video hahaha
2:31 Someone watched Every Frame a Painting
If it was an American cop movie, there would be more shooting scenes in the movie, lol 🤣
The greatest British film of all time
The haunted house I volunteer with has an ex cop running it, and we always say The Greater Good as a joke to this movie
I'd like to add a lot of Scots where I come from have accents so thick my south English cannot understand a word their saying. Instead he relies on me and my mum translate. So I can understand the pain of anyone trying to understand David Bradleys character.
Nicholas angel with all due respect Sir  You can't make me disappear  Chief Inspector Are yes I can I'm the chief Inspector Hehe I love this Movie I like that Kids DOB answer 22 February What year Every year pretty clever answer
8:20 will never NOT make me laugh. It's honestly one of my favorite scenes in movie history.
I grew up in a very mixed but predominately Irish area and I can understand everything the gun toting farmer says
The only Copaganda movie that's worth a damn
12:25 well it’s not like there are many major British action films we can reference, most of the films you watch in America, we watch in England/Britain/UK (btw they are all different things) Also Hogwarts never exploded. There was the Battle of Hogwarts but it never got demolished/exploded, it got damaged a lot but that was because of the giants and Death Eaters. I’m a big Harry Potter fan, not all brits like Harry potter
2:43 Can someone tell which movie is this frame?
I think you missed the funniest line in the whole movie. When PC Doris sees the pig getting spit-roasted says to the 2 blokes either side of her words to the effect of ' that's me after a couple of pints'
Unless you live in rural southern England you will never truly appreciate just how fucking accurate this film is. Our village Summerfields was EXACTLY like that.  Also they actually trashed a real summer fields for this film.
Americas Barry Potter is columbine
Doesn't the first scene reference Patrick McGoohan's opening sequence in the Prisoner?
what an ad transition.. Flawless
these are have been by far my favourite vids to watch well written and hilarious well dome
From the prologue Joe Cornish as Bob was missed out… 😮
BIG BOOTY INTERNET IS HERE ASSHOLES A NEW YORK STATE
At first, I thought that the policeman with the glasses was the killer. I thought that because the shop owner was too obvious, he was definitely a red herring. Then I was thinking to myself, ‘hey, the speccy neek has been given was too many scenes of him asking how Angel will deal with the murders’, I thought he was trying to figure out how to evade capture. I overthink a lot 👍
Dunno if anyone else has commented on this or not, but the role of Danny was originally meant to be woman named Victoria. Edgar, Nick and Simon decided to leave the dialogue unchanged
that smoothles entry to sponser segment
Cop is short for copper. A lot of early police badges in America were made from that metal
4:01 percy jackson. Yeah the movie was dogshit but we got the better protaganist
I thought you’d include when Angel says ‘you must be pulling my leg’  and it cuts to a body being pulled by the leg XD
I always busted out laughing at the scene with Skinner smiling the exact same way as his photo for some reason that shot always killed me🤣
Honestly the English dialect translation joke is my favorite of the movie
this content is like cinema sins but more educating than funny, that's what we need!
A film like this wouldnt get made anymore...
One of the best British movies ever made!
I like how one of the books the cop is reading is about a galaxy spanning anarchist civilization encountering earth and deciding whether to make contact with us or not.
Fun fact I've actually meet and acted with the guy who played the gun owner, who also plays flich, he's a right getelman in real life, always up for a conversation.
My wife enjoys those historical dramas and made sure to point out Foul-Mouthed PC Thatcher plays Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown. Can't take it seriously now.
What about the part where Danny wears a cowboy outfit almost identical to the one Paul wears when walking through the town in disguise
6:10
Holy cats, I forgot that Bill Bailey & Olivia bloody Coleman are in this!
I genuinely don't know how many times I've seen this movie, I had about a year where I didn't have home internet and a  couple boxes of dvds, this one spent days in the dvd player
I cannot believe you failed to mention alll the other things that make this movie a greatest.   For example when he meets his ex Janeen or however you spell it, the open grass area behind him when he is standing at the window...that is the same open grass area when he goes see his girlfriend Liz in Shawn of the Dead
The director of sing what
Losing phone signal is not really an indication of how far away from London you get, I get the train often from London to Wales and after Slough which is only about 20 miles from London I can struggle to have a phone signal unless I'm in the middle of a town/city
Catch me later!
one of the top 5 movies ever made, period
I love how they broke the 4th wall with: "Bad Actor?" "Undoubtably"
Skinner looks like the real life fleshy version of a Guy Fawkes mask
what about when the receptionist tells him he has always been here I think that was a shinning reference
Being a Generation X Australian, I get all the referential jokes. Australian TV in the 70's and 80's was mainly British - BBC, Australian - ABC, American and Japanese. That being said, Game of Thrones can go fornicate itself. I dismissed it before the ending of episode 1 as being Days of Our Lives in period dress. One of the greatest mixed genre movies of all time being pleasantly reviewed by one of the best channels on Thuh Choob. Made my day, cheers.
the amount of references i make to this on the daily .   just yesterday someone said to me i had a beard after i drank somethign , and the satisfaction of saying  ' i know ' in the accent was immaculate .  i always repeat ' the greater good ' if anyone says it   if anyone says ' what you thinkin about ' or ' what you thinkin ' ill always reply with ' idk . pub ? '  me and my parents quote it randomly , e.g one of us will say ' no luck catching them swans then ' and another will say ' its just the one swan actully , then its ' no luck catching them killers then ' and then ' its just the one killer actually '  ' what you want from the shop ' or ' anything from the shop ? '  ' cornetto .'  one of my favourite movies ever .
High School Musical = Americas Harry Potter
one of my fave Simon Pegg movies of all time.. i love this flick.. have the Blu Ray... so easily re-watchable...  NOW I HAVE TO GO HOME AND WATCH IT AGAIN AFTER WORK ! ! ! !
4:34 Collars match the cuffs :)
Bill Nye the mean looking guy  Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.     Wrong show?
went to school in the town where it was filmed and its just weird watching it.
When I don’t have time to watch the whole movie, I can still savor its joy thanks to these videos. Great work.
after he mentioned the greater good like jedi the chief mentioned younglings immediately after and later on we see their corpses
America doesn't have a Harry potter it's it's own TV show it's literally the laughing stock of the whole world
Best comedy since Monty Python.
And Olivia Colman, future best actress oscar winner.
Same author yes, but even better, one book shows the author as Iain Banks (fiction) and the other as Iain M. Banks (science fiction).
This God crap, I couldn't be played to like it
Win for "with respect sire you can't make people dissappear" "yes I can im cheif inspector" does kinda foreshadow the whole film
I'll be honest, it wasn't until you pointed out that The Hound was Lurch that I actually put that together
This movie is why every time someone says the greater good I feel inclined to repeat it in a monotone voice
Fun fact: Simon pegg admitted in the commentary for hot fuzz that he has a mask fetish
Young stupid me thought this was a sequel to shaun of the dead
Simon Skinner mentions in the movie he does life drawing classes and you can see a drawing right on the wall at 15:04
Beard win?
A whodunnit in which, no matter whom you suspect, you’re right.
America’s Hogwarts is Ilvermorny
You missed out Adam Buxton. He's fantastic. The one that got splattered by the church spire
The shot of Nick and Danny's feet at 6:58 is a call back to the closing credit sequence of "The Bill." A UK police drama from the 90s.
One of my absolute favorite movies of all time
Thanks for putting this video together; it helps toward the greater good.
America's Harry Potter is the Fast and the Furious franchise.
Almost had a headache listening to the commentary.
wait your like 30 something? you sound like a teenager
Witty and excellent!
When does he mention Olivia Coleman?
“Yea boy and yea Roy”! Didn’t know til now 👌🏼
Marty McFly is probably America's closest analog to Harry Potter. It is far from perfectly analogues, but he is best fit for "representation of culturally typical nerdy-but-actually-cool kid" with relation to acceptance and adoration by multicultural markets. Of course "Back to the Future" was not a book first, but that too is kind of the American equivalent of something British...
0:48 The use of these words could be a homage to the song "Shakedown" by Bob Seger, the opening song to Beverly Hills Cop II
Yaaarrrrp!
This is one of those films you have to watch five times at 0.5x the speed just to notice all the jokes/subtle foreshadowing that no one would ever notice normally.   My favourite bit is probably the scene where he meets the unintelligible farmer.
I was once pulled over for a bad tail light and given a warning. Right when he let me go and started back to his patrol car, I yelled out the window, "Catch me later" and zoomed off. I could see him smiling in the side mirror.
I only just realized that Nicholas clearly jumps on a trampoline to flip over the last fence, just like he did in Shaun of the Dead.  Even though they're both fence gags, I never connected that part of it.
is there a GoT Triplet in Hot Fuzz?  7:59 The Hound,  9:54 Walder Frey. Can't find the last one though...
You get a like simply for acknowledging Julia Deakin as Landlady Marsha… Big Win in my book!
Cop is not an acronym of constable on patrol.  It is short for copper.  Which comes from the Latin “capere” meaning to capture.  This term was first recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1704.  Standing for “Constable on patrol” is a total and utter modern myth
America's Harry Potter is still Harry Potter. We've appropriated like all proper Americans
3:19 Me as a HoI Player: Well yes, actually that is exactly the face....
14:20 Additional Win I just realized as I just watched this again yesterday.  Leslie says, "As far as I'm concerned, Cousin Sissy can go and f-" before being cut off.  While this is a fun bit of F-word censorship, it's also a pronoun/plot-point censorship.  Most people would assume Cousin Sissy to be female based on the name being said throughout the monologue.  However, it's revealed later in the movie that Cousin Sissy is actually referring to Simon Skinner.  Had she finished the sentenced, she would've said, "...-uck himself." Which might've tipped more people off to whom she was referring.  Ultimately, the whole monologue becomes irrelevant from a "villain motivation" standpoint, but it's still clever that they censored it, as to not give away who the killer is...despite actively doing so throughout the whole movie.
Beautiful family ❤️
One of my favorite movies.
You forgot to point out that the n.w.a system is named after a gangster rap group
Simple answer to what's great about this film. Yes
I gotta say, the way you’re just sitting on your bed while your child is just screaming and having fun is the funniest shit I’ve ever seen.
From a Brit here: great vid, but PLEEEASE do a little unknown gem called *”IN BRUGES”* 🙏🏼
this is an appreciation comment for cinema kid and cinema dog
3:58 In terms of books, I would probably have to say that it would be Percy Jackson.
9:53 this is what it sounds like for us English when we hear hillbilly
One of my favorite movies.
So that is what you look like!
It was only at 11:31 when you mentioned James Bond than I realized that Skinner is played by Timothy Dalton.
Just spotted at 12:27 as they're looking over the wreckage of the house explosion, the church where the next murder takes place is in the background.
The model village piece plays in to one of the Andy's telling him that if he wants to be a big cop in a small town he should **** off to the model village.  Just brilliant.
Fun fact: at 11:17 when sergeant angel says that traffic “accident” applies there is no one to blame, was an actual debate in Britain back in the early 2000’s as they called this an RTA which stood for “Road Traffic Accident” but they had to change it to RTC - “Road Traffic Collision” as RTA was used in court and let drunk drivers off the hook as accident implies no one is at fault.
Two things. 1) Sandford is where all the police (on paper) training scenarios take place. Nice nod to the bobbies (cops) there.  2) My American joke is...that I'm married to one and don't want to piss her off. Also something about healthcare for guns.?
6:22 See you next Tuesday is a great underused joke, for people who don’t know, you might have to search it up.
10:07 being from up north england I understand what you call incomprehensible 1
"The Greater Good" The first thing I remember when this movie is mentioned.
I always come back to this video because hot fuzz is amazing. And edgar right is amazing. Everything about this is amazing
I actually got a Cornetto ad halfway through!
Love this channel. Love the love for Edgar Wright and how much appreciation there is for practical filmmaking.
Yeah "zombies party" is my favorite spanish movie from the director eduardo gomez lol
Love the vid obv, one of my favourite films. One thing that an US person might not notice from the ‘kids being arrested’ scene is that it is stereotypical that people from the West Country have surnames that end in ‘er’. Someone else has probably said this but I couldn’t be bothered to read all the comments.
Also the flower arrangement can act like on of those Name Wreaths.. almost as a threat
I grew up in Somerset where a lot of it was filmed and while I don't really have the accent, I haven't stopped saying Yarp since I first saw this movie.
6:15 Also, very nice detail: The swear box is the next station on the tour because Danny insulted the Andys and now has to pay the price.
Twilight is Americas harry potter
Fun movie! Loving the analysis as usual!
don't forget that Frank Butterman calls himself a bit of a cowboy nut at the church fair, linking action films with their immediate predecessor (Westerns) and really hammering in just how warped his sense of morality actually is
Martin freeman was also Tim in the UK office (the equivalent to Jim In the US version!)
Bill nighey the science guyhey.
1:58 directors cameo by the way
Hey you must do everything great about Shaun of the Dead unless you have already done one I will see!
Not at what I expected him to look like… I was expecting a more slender build. Everything else seems to fit.
Always loved this movie and was able to find it for $2 at a charity store after it was removed it from Netflix now I’ve watched it to many times.
If I ever play a "villain in plain sight" character, I will require there to be a seen where I smile into the camera, while there's a picture of myself smiling in the same manner in the background.
10:20 So disappointed he doesn't mention Bill Bailey!
Please make everything great about bolt
You know why there’s no everything wrong with hot fuzz? Because there isn’t. There is no mistakes in this movie
american harry potter? fast and furrious ? xD
Lotr is the American Harry Potter
This review was made for The Greater Good.
I watched this for the first time yesterday cause of you and you are right your vids don't do justice to how great the movies you cover.
What is America’s Harry Potter? Is it too dark to say the sound of gunshots?
Your best cinema wins ever
You will get likes and comments dor so many years to come, as this is a movie that is watched over and over.  I also appreciate your appreciation of the Cornetto trilogy.  I hope every rewatch for you is enjoyable as the first
3:52 why do all americans go to school, why shouldnt they just stay at home?
1:10 - 1:28 Hey, I knew Steve Coogan before Night at the Museum when he was both Mole in Wind in the Willows and Phileas Fogg in Around the World in 80 Days.
the voice for the WRONG videos is so much better than this dude... where's your soul dude? this is sad
looking back remember the episode you announced the birth of your kid and knowing I’ve watched this channel as they grow up. nutty
I love this reveiew,a d total pick apart, but growing up with a village in the UK hat wouldn't let us have a chip sop or chinese takeaway due to the litter or smell! This is weirdly rural UK! and abrilliant film, bloody curch fates . . . I miss em in 2022
Americas harry potter? Well wizards hall, the book harry potter stole from.
Omg thats Marsha from Spaced @3:25 !!!! She was one of my favorite characters! I love Simon for casting actors he's acted with before 😊😊😊 I haven't seen HotFuzz since it basically came out (though I loved it immensely even though it gave me a headache. Literally) and watched Spaced years later so it's my first time catching this lovely cameo 😊
And the guy with the shot gun is the Lord of the River lands, Walder Frey.. It's becoming a real GOT fest all of a sudden...
My friend and I spent a good few months at uni greeting each other with "Mornin Angle!" with no memory of where it was from. I don't know what impact it's had on American culture, but in the UK it's ingrained in our minds 😂
Americas version of Harry Potter is Percy Jackson
Harry Potter may be cringey as f*ck, but at least Hogwarts never had a school shooting
What is America's Harry Potter... I dunno, gun crime?
The p.i. staker joke in my favorite bit in the movie
*t h e g r e a t e r g o o d*
The funny thing is that a few months after the film came out, they banned smoking indoors in England. So this is possibly the last big British film that featured the smoking trope.
If amarica has a harry potter its shit
Am I the only one who has to do a double take when he says NWA? Lol
The twins at the front desk running is one of my all-time favorite jokes
12:04 Olivia Colman, always a win.
I have that plant. the white leaf is actually a flower.
I love the ad I skipped it the first time I watched it. But showing a kid be a kid is a great way to sell these to parents :p
The word "Cop" actually came from Britain buddy, derived from "Copper"
I loved this film
Tiny fly-by detail at 6:57 - the shot of two pairs of uniform feet on the pavement is from a UK police show called The Bill. Blink and you miss it!
2:11 is that Mr.Bean?
Raycons are cheap, and they sound cheaper.
I think this is one of if not NY favorite breakdown of yours. And it's also I'm my top 3 favorite movies, so that makes sense.
Wins be waaay better than sins.
Yeah butter beer least we don’t to wait till 21 to legally buy alcohol chin chin motherfuckers 😂😂🍻🍻
I got to write about Hot Fuzz for a film music class in college and it’s still one of my favorite papers to this day.
Since no one asked. The train interiors and exteriors don't match. They also don't go to the area he would be travelling to.
I like the greater good
When I was younger I stayed at a friends house whose dad with a REALLY strong Cornish accent, after I came home me and my brother watched hot fuzz and I could understand the unintelligible farmer, my mind was blown
I’m from near where this was filmed so completely understood the second guy
I live in the city hot Fuzz was filmed at it curses my existence I just want one day I don't hear about it.
The pi stacker, looks like he's the father of one of the arrested kids as their last time is staker
Thanks. I'd forgotten how great Hot Fuzz is.  Just watched courtesy of Netflix. to The Greater Good !??
Kings man reference
This is hands down my favourite Edgar wright movie
“You’ve got a moustache” “I know” My favourite bit and you missed it out
this movie is the pinnacle of filmmaking, change my mind
Edgar Wright is definitely one of my favourite directors not only does he make movie fun but his camera work and writing is spot on and funny
American Harry Potter is Percy Jackson
America's Harry Potter? Easy; college, and the drink? Bud light
America's Harry Potter: Harry potter
I only now noticed how Danny shoots the doctor in the leg with an air rifle just like Ed shot his sister in the leg with an air rifle.
Timothy Dalton was amazing in hot fuzz, his best performance since his time as Bond
I'd make a point about Walder Frey mumbling in too many movies, but let's be honest, that's all he does anyway.
6:20 glad im not there as a scotsman i would be 10,00,00 in detp in 5 minutes
06:15 - I've seen these movies dozens of times and I can still laugh my ass off about most jokes, but I ALWAYS lose it when Nick Frost gets the wastebasket chucked at him. So random. So glorius.  So perfect.
This movie and Spaceballs tie for my favourite movie of all time. It's so good
the word cop came from british slang "copper"
by the way, Steve Coogan was already well known because of alan partridge & martin freeman was known for the uk office
15:19 hahaha your son is so cute xD
incomprehensible British English? Clearly whoever subtitled this has never had a drunk night out in England before. The was fluent English
I finally figured out who cut their leg in the greenhouse chase after Tillers murder. It was Lurch. There was a suspect switch right outside the back exit of the flower shop. The next suspect was from there until the hedgerow when they changed again. Before that middle suspect went through the glass that cut their leg they used a large bowie-style knife to cut through the greenhouse vinyl curtain. We later see Armstrong use that knife to attack Nicholas in his hotel room and then at the castle before Angel disarms him and uses it to put it to Dannys throat as a human shield. This is why I love Edgar Wright. Even the seemingly unsolved things he leaves clues so you can figure it out.
Hey I live in Gloucestershire
Higurashi but it's bri'ish
No wicker man reference? Not the Nicolas Cage one but the 1973 one. Tom Weaver was Sgt Howie the sacrificed virgin. (Spoiler)
3:59 Wizards Of Waverly Place
3:55  Just so you know America's Harry Potter is Percy Jackson.
When the actors get pulled over, it's regarded as the shortest car chase in any movie
hi
Expert and smart vid. Thanq
How have I just learnt that cop stands for constables on patrol!
I don't remember the last time I saw a Somerfield's. Are they still a thing?
"incomprehensible 1 and incomprehensible 2" ... but neither of them is incomprehensible 😂
Now I love this movie top to bottom. But my favorite is when they drop the drunk guy off and he tries paying angel and danny. 🤣🤣🤣 gets me every time
12:05 This woman played the Wueen of England, btw.
=)
Angel is exercising his stab weakened hand in the match cut.
why didn't you mention the throw back to shaun of the dead, were he says, "what's the matter? Haven't you ever taken a short cut before" and jumps over the garden walls?
You have a very cute dog 🐕
Did ya notice the dinos? I didn't.  Ah, the trials of Fatherhood
Isn’t the fence jump scene a joke referencing Shaun of the Dead? Shaun barrels through while Sgt Angel hurdles them, effortlessly.
I have literally only watched this movie once because of the guy getting stabbed through the bottom of the jaw at the end.  I dont know what THAT is too much gore for me when literally Shaun of the Dead has a guy getting his guts ripped out.
Im so bad at faces i never realized slug horn and filch are in here 😀
'Cop' comes from 'copper', it came from England originally, I believe
Fun fact it was the Raycon promotion that got me to like the video not the video.
shuan -burger40
Very late to the party but fast and furious is definitely american Harry Potter
Why use night sticks when you can just use tear gas and lethal force
Ok ok heres my making fun of 'Murica comment     Pfffft, walking? Couldn't you get the hunky guy from the book cover to carry you around?
11:23 they couldn't get Bristol rovers football club to let them use their shirt so the colouredd it in black
Star Wars is the American Harry Potter.
1:39 I actually met Bill Nighy while he was reading a book down on the sea shores of Brighton, was a very nice man
the problem for me in this video is the  censorship. But this come from the stupid management of youtube. Still a good vidéo
We know exactly what cop means we’re not Japanese.
I always wonder if Stafford is that same town from Torchwood ‘Countrycide’, but in another universe.
Do they have cigarettes that are full of tea or something for movies? If not, why not? You don't have to hit your own hand with a hammer in a movie right?
I’d say America’s Harry Potter would be Percy Jackson… But those movies aren’t nearly good enough to even hold a candle to the books they’re based on…
20% off? Thats terrible,  tyson sells them 50% off
I hail from the south-west of the UK, in a county that borders Gloucestershire, so I can actually understand what PC Bob Walker is saying. Also his surname, Walker, is because he's the dog handler.
“What’s America’s Harry Potter?” Percy Jackson
watched this movie last night just so i could watch these videos today lol
It’s funny as a British person to listen to others talk about this movie and the language too. It’s hilarious but nice with videos like this
So.... Tau invaded England?
SWAAAAN
My parents absolutely love this film (and Shaun Of The Dead and The World's End) and they quote it to eachother all the time, to the point I picked up on it and started repeating them back before I'd even see these films. Hot Fuzz is easily in my top 5 favourite films now.
Also, the fence hopping is a reference to Shaun of the Dead where Shaun tried (and failed) at fence hopping
Btw, right off the bat you're wrong.  It's a movie about POLICE OFFICERS.  Cops is an american word..
4:30 The grandson of Tom Weever!,  *reads subtitles* oh...
So great that an American loves English humour
Yes, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy would be great!
I’m gonna fun of America, because you can drink in the U.K. at 16 in bars, and yet you can own a rifle at 18, but not drink 21.
Love these videos! Just stopping by to say that Martin Freeman was absolutely a household name at this point, thanks to his stint in the office. True, at this point he ranked lower than Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy but he was definitely known :)
Can you do everything great about real steel
I’d say the American hp would be sw
8:50 This is particularly ironic since HF was shot in Wells which has a cathedral that had to be edited out in some scenes.
You missed the win of when Danny asks what film to watch first. Angel, "you're pulling my leg" Cuts to Geroge being dragged by his leg
1:38 I actually have met him and he seemed a very nice man so you should be alright
If you looked at the hotel phone that Angel answers it says on it "Don't answer"
Wait do you not normally work at home anyway. 🤔
I like how the music supervisor’s name is Nick Angel, huh
Am I the only one to notice that, all the murderous NWA are old people and yet the 1 running away from the florists was running like Usain Bolt! And I know Timothy Dalton runs marathons BUT, as Simon Pegg mentions, "I think there's more than 1 killer".
I don't think anyone else has said this so ima say it 15:16 now that is a beautiful beard win
i like your doge
"Cop" is an insult to police officers - why? Because it comes from the phrase "bent as a copper piece", because early copper coinage was easily bent. "Bent" refers to being "crooked", so if you call a police officer a "cop" what you are actually doing is calling them corrupt. American police, of course, don't know their own history, but British police do - so don't call a British police officer a "cop".
i've seen both hot fuzz and half blood prince a million times and i only just realised thats slughorn
I love your videos thank you for all the happiness
The greater good.  OH SHUT IT!!!
america's harry potter is percy jackson
7:37 the fact that you took the time to line up saying the word swan to when it was said in film. Perfect
I've watched this many times and this is the first time I've noticed "hog lumps" behind the bar, referring to Shaun of the Dead.
You can even tell how Nicolas keeps his main focus on skinner when he tells him that he is a slasher because he has cause to watch him as if he was confessing. But then after he says that he slashes prices and that he actually works at the shop, Nicolas refocuses himself on where he’s running and being generally cautious like you would be running through town. Because he hasn’t got to be concerned anymore
Woah, kinda threw me for a loop seeing what you actually look like, so used to just seeing you as a disembodied voice. Nice beard!
We all know this video would be the full film if it could be
I'm from the south west, surrounded by accents like in Hot Fuzz, and surprisingly I can just about understand Filch in this. It's quite funny :) Also why does no one know Martin Freeman from the original Office?
As a Somerset-born lad... I can understand that thick Wezzcountry accent.
3:42 why don't they just shoot up a school for fun??
If you’re reading this, you should watch the Critical Drinker and Mauler break down this movie (they did Sean of the Dead too) in their 3hr podcast on the channel Critical Drinker Extra Shots. It’s really good.
Bruh those kids who were drinking were so ugly bruh
I’m still angry because this film isn’t available in my country on Netflix and VPN’s don’t work for my account :(
They've put a fence gag in every movie in the cornetto trilogy
I’m still waiting for cold fuzz
"No I mean which one do you want to watch first?" "You are pulling my leg" Cut to Mr. Merchant being pulled by his legs by the killer.
People knew who Martin Freeman was then cos of the office
The thing is that muppet is a way u can call some one a bit dumb/stupid with out being rude in the uk
Might be a stretch, but during the fair thing Danny and his dad were dressed as Cowboys while his mom was dressed as an Indian foreshadowing that her death wasn’t an accident
All I want is for Edgar Wright, Nick Frost and Simon Pegg to do a movie together again. Don't know how many tumes I've watched both of those movies over the years. Heck, I think I watched them both around Christmas.
Yk splat the rat is an actual game. It’s the English equivalent of wakamole
It’s funny, I can understand david Bradley in this movie since the people here sound basically like that
Americans Harry Potter is Percy jackson
Your match cuts with your son had me rolling on the floor laughing.  If anyone ask what being a Dad is like, show them that.  Especially the hug at the end.
I went into this movie blind. No trailers. Didn't even read the description. It was chosen by my roommate for movie night. I'd seen maybe one poster for it once. And boy was I glad I knew nothing.
Easter egg I noticed: in the scene where Danny is looking at the "super cop" film, as he puts it down there's a film called "Zombie Party" Which has the film cover of Shaun of the dead (the one with the zombies at the door)
Skinner entering frame at 8:33, hand first, holding the cookies, is such a subtle reference to all the times Edgar Wright has a hand enter the frame holding something I never noticed it until now.
I am really glad that there's someone that's actually talking about why the movies are good and not bad. Thanks for that man.
10:11 - ASBO = Anti Social Behaviour Order ... an order, given out by a court, to stop a person from behaving in certain ways or doing certain things
If I had to choose America's Harry Potter, I would have to go with "Harry Dresden"
America's Harry Potter I would say is Percy Jackson
Americas Harry Potter is root beer. It’s fucking horrible
0:25 we call em coppas
“What’s America’s Harry Potter?”  Um, Disney
3:31 is it just me or does it say Hogwarts but with a Z
12:21 To be fair, Americans do it way more.
I'm redeeming the the American insult   America isn't better than any other country
No the greater good is tau heresy witch I’m now gonna purge
my mums old best friend is uncle pete
That promo was amazing, it's too bad that raycons are garbage
literally had to pause at 2:37 just to go and rewatch the movie
I prefer the sins
I simply love your channel.
Ok I was told to make fun of Americans so  Americans sorry I can't give you a piggy back you just too heavy
Nicholas kicking those kids out of the bar is like a security guard kicking American kids out of a McDonald's
I like how his voice reminds me of the Cinema sins guys doesn’t have to sound like it just gives me the same feel which made me sun
please make everything great about bolt
It took me looking up the cast to realise that it was bill bailey playing the twin police "receptionist" (not sure what else id call it). He looks so different with a full head of hair
That Andes joke from Danny is actually pretty intelligent coming from him. Also i LOVE the delivery, the confidence in his face and then the bin.
Missed the part with the Shining reference!
America's Harry Potter is Star Wars...think about it.
Edgar Wright has made everyone outside the UK believe that we have about 10 actors.
Shame
Is that a Toller?
Harry Potter and semoine.
The USA’s Harry Potter is I like to think Percy Jackson
10:06 im not english so i dont under stand “incomprehensible 1” but i really thought most people understood “incomprehensible 2”
Please make everything great about bolt
The incomprehensible 1 is something I can say with confidence I understood before translated by Danny
i moved from london to gloucestershire when i was pretty young and i’m still surprised by how accurately this movie portrays gloucestershire as a whole just through one town. i hate it here
Cop is a British-originated word I believe. Also, Adam and the Ants’ ‘Goody Two Shoes’ in the opening
My dad was one of the Andes friends in highschool Paddy
Simon Pegg and Nick frost are the single best acting duo of all time
That isn’t a church, it’s actually Wells Cathedral, also dannies accent is true to rural Somerset, we do have a tendancy to sound like pirates lol
Why don't Americans have McDonald's all the time?
You See the reason why the swan so Important in the movie is in orders of royal family all swains are on equal levels to Queen in turn if kill an swan you be sentence to life in prison and if murder or charge one up you sentence to death and also swans are an a pask in small towns
I say The Simpson's with Duff beers
went to college with the ginger kid and i work with one of the hoodies at the fountain.
Why does cw looks like he's going to hurt you when he's in his serious face mode Physically
It took until now to realise that maybe the reason Angel is so good at jumping is from the time he briefly wanted to be a frog
I showed my cousin this movie once My mother walked in during the big reveal at the end and was soooo confused
i haven't been bothered to scroll though all the comments. As much as i enjoy your commentary, from a UK villagers point of view , you miss a lot of country jokes. Even in my lifespan the village has become more cosmopolitan and it does have a placards for "best village" award , and it used to matter.  Village life is surreal compared to the modern world. 56k dial up was a thing in 2000
Fuck, now I have to watch this movie... again... for the 21424th time... awesome
Fot Huzz
Jeez you distracted me so much with the match cuts I watched the whole ad instead of skipping ahead to the next part lmao
This was filmed in my father's home town. Every time we go back there to visit his parents we'll reference this film at least once.
America's Harry Potter is Percy Jackson
Have you ever concluded that you deserve a beautiful beard win
Cant believe you didn't comment on Elizabeth Coleman and her 'jokes'...
Second time watching this and all I can think is 'I really hope that this has caused someone to go and watch this film.' Because honestly it is awesome.  Also movies with mikey does a great eps on the cornetto trilogy (sorry about bad spelling)
I love the Raycon ad, so freaking wholesome
Another fun and interesting fact: the man in the crime scene who is only ever referred to as Not Janine is Robert Popper. His most notable work is probably the comedy series Friday Night Dinner starring Tom Rosenthal and Simon Bird (As seen in the Inbetweeners) with Paul Ritter (Quantum of Solace and The Half Blood Prince) and finally Tamsin Grieg and Mark Heap, both of whom have been in the Cornetto Trilogy. He is listed in the credits but without a role so I was quite surprised to find that. Hope you all learnt something from this.
3:57 Challenge accepted, Mr Wins      Okay, so Millie Bobby Brown- wait, no, she's British Um, okay, Micheal Fassbender... wait, also British Emma Watson is.... also British Julie Walters! Also British Um... Daniel Radcli- British Charlie Chaplin is.... again, also British David Suchet is... British. Huh.  Sorry, just trying to think of a good, well-known American actor
Everything Great About Willow?
How to take a shot at American beer... Well, for starters, it's all gnats PISS with no depth of flavour whatsoever. It leaves a nasty aftertaste (what a surprise!) And is only beaten strength wise by your tap water!
I watch this movie with my departed dad, and every time I see a clip or video of this movie I just press it out of habit. Thank you for bringing light to a movie I love for many reasons
*mentioned "Hitch Hiker's Guide" and the word "bypass" in the same video  my brain: "It's a bypass! You have to build bypasses!"
I... did not know the CinemaWins guy earned his own beautiful beard win
please do Rea Search on COPS Befor calling them cops
The accent was incomprehensible West Country
I had to give this movie a few tries before I really got into it, but man it is absolutely one of my favorites. Really great all-around production.
Man imagine having to pay for school
NWA is a  rap group from Compton.
I don’t think we consciously equate things to “American” movies - more that quite a few movies are American 😂
American’s Harry Potter is Harry Potter
"this isn't in America, so calling them cops might not work"  - the word "cops" or "coppers" is literally London slang in origin.
This is my most favourite cop movie of all time. Two police bros eating cornettos and fucking up a whole town full of Karens. Hell yeah!
Andes..cause he has a point.. AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I've watched Hot Fuzz around 6 times and I never noticed The NWA are always lurking on the background. Every re-watch is always a delight for these Cornetto Trilogy
When she says "as far as im concerned Cousin Sissy can go fu-" she was about to say himself
The guy cate blanchet was dating who said "hello there" soundedd like bane
Haha no free healthcare
I think cops can apply to british police, as they are sometimes referred to as "coppers", probably because of old money  Also "constable" is "cun-stubble"
you missed the fence scene was based on a similar scene on Sean of the Dead
Did you just say policeman officer
I didn't see any humans in the raycon add in the end, just animals and small human animals.
I hate how much you make fun of British people it really offends me or I'll never watch again 😡😠
2 things:  This is probably (definitely) my favorite movie of all time. Your son is SO adorable I can’t even handle it.
you should do a video on bolt
For your RayCon commercial, did you direct your child or is that him acing naturally?
ALL American beer is Butter-Beer.
I love that I sound like these guys lol. It’s all for the greaterrr gooood! 😂
This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I've seen that movie 30 times and it never gets boring
The one thing not great about Hot Fuzz - it’s no longer on Hulu or Netflix ☹️.
"With respect sir, you can't simply make people disappear" "Yes I can, I'm the chief inspector" Foreshadows Frank's true colours
So...do we all agree Danny and nick are a bit more than friends
6:19 the swear box says "proceeds to go to the church roof restoration" . Always a new detail to find at every rewatch
Me and my brother say for the greater good when ever we hear it
"Have you ever fired your gun up on the air and said ah?" Its commonly repeated between me and my friends
Can you make "everything great about 2020"? Could be the hope we all needed
Honestly, this is one of my all time fav movies. And, it's so intense... brutal, funny, intelligent... (mind blowing, if you want to say so (double meaning, pun intended!)) and I love all the actors, and their acting! Thank you very much for this review!
you know? im sure raycons are brilliant but i prefer my headphones that give me 30 hours of Bluetooth and sound better by comparison
Jeez I'm so used to Cinemasins negativity and cynicism
America doesn't have a Harry Potter. What you do have is a drinking age that requires all patrons to have a greying beard and own at least one item of tweed clothing before you're allowed entry.
So....honestly?  Nice fucking match cuts haha!  Also great video, thanks for it!
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME AND NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT IT. THANK YOU
YOU HAVE A FUCKING KID!?!?!? YOU SOUND SO YOUNG
As time goes by this film rises steadily in the list of great movies. Every time I see it, it gets better, more so than ANY other film. I am honestly beginning to think this is a perfect film.
Americas Harry Potter is that your extra small clothes are the uk’s 4xlarge
No cinemasins on hot fuzz, as it should be.
The kids in the pub, they could drink butterbeer. but if they were american, they might need a beer after a day of school shooting
Could we please get an Everything GREAT About Paddington 2 video?
Literally the whole movie is great, that's half an hour saved.
I love Hot fuzz and shaun of the dead
Do The World’s 🔥 🌎 End
This is a weirdly stupid reason to murder.  I remember a Monk clip where someone murdered a big box store coworker for the title of employee of the month.  She did it not for the mug, the plaque or the voucher but the parking spot so her and her buddies could rob a bank.  That's a better motive.
I still love referring to cops as policemanofficers because of this movie
40K players when they hear the greater good
This was my fave movie to watch with my ex and I thought she’d ruined it for me..... turns out you can’t ruin hot fuzz
side note, Sergeant Angel's officer number is 777, which some say is the number of your guardian angel
Find it mad that you’ve got this on your channel when it was filmed in a little city so close to me 🤯🤯
Fatherhood is always a win
No it’s only because you have only seen Simon pegg movies that you think everything is a comparison to American movies in the uk. Get owned. I do like watching you though
I’m just retroactively commenting a bunch: finish the cornetto trilogy, do everything great about the World’s End.
Damn. You have a reeaaaaally nice house. Like damn. Just nice
The part when angel is about to hop the fences is a call back to shaun on the dead too
Hot Fuzz is better than Shaun of the Dead, there, I said it
What is America’s version of Harry Potter?... Die hard? 😬
The yellow car scene (you know the one) was something my parents showed me and my sister when we were 7. It messed me up
Plz do world's end
I’ve actually been to the town where most of the shots in this film were taken, I’ve sat in the sandford crown right next to the vest Simon pegg wore
Here's a roast to the Americans High school musical is terrible
I hadn’t thought about Danny knowing his mother’s death wasn’t an accident!
Why can’t Americans have free healthcare?
Noticed the small little ‘half-arsed’ love how you really understand the context of our film culture and the country
8:36 Isn’t that guy a time lord from the episode when david tennant regenerated?
Kudos that you, an American, made a point within the first to minutes to actually say 'half-ARSED" ;)
the 229 dislikes think that fascism is wonderful
What is the UK equivalence of Harry Potter to america?
You glossed over the fact the when Danny crashes through the fence, you can hear someone laughing in the background
The mcu is America’s Harry potter
You guys can't drink till 21 lol
Happy birthday ginger dude
Some of Danny’s lines where supposed to be for a love interest and it’s cute when you notice which lines were supposed to be for the love interest like when Danny ask him to come inside for another beer.
Happy Birthday to the 22nd of february guy
Apparently the word cop is from "coppers" and copper was the term for someone who "cops", or arrests people.
Danny running through the fence just explains my life
Flapjacks are a bar made with oats raisins and maple syrup and what you eat as pancakes are crepes
Surprised you never spoke about Edward Woodward who was the original equilisor.....
OMG CUTE Doggy and I love this film its my favourite
.... SHARK!!
How did you miss that Simon pegg jumping the fences also happens in Shaun of the dead but just less successful and that side is portrayed by nick frost crashing through the fence after him
The church looming in the background is the reality in rural England! Side note I went to college nearby to where it was filmed (filmed in Wells) and went to the audition for extras, I didn't get in but I know a few of the kids in the pub!
America's Harry Potter is The Hunger Games.
just watched this movie
Its the best film
I just rewatched Dr who Smith and Jones and couldn’t remember Anne Reid’s name, so thanks
14:11 PLASMAVORE
Love the movie and the analysis #positivitythatsawin
Can't wait for worlds end
I'm a little late to the party but excellent plug for raycon. Just wanted to say I think it was well filmed and well incorporated. I imagine its not the most fun of things for a YouTuber to deal with, but the extra mile, the willingness to lean into it does wonders in my opinion.   Thanks for reviewing hot fuzz also! I watched this movie for the first time a few years ago and I loved how many things got Chekov'd (I may have misspelled it but Chekov's gun is the principle I'm referring to?)
I met the cast of Hot Fuzz at the Premiere in 2007 (best day of my life) I then found out that my Fiance's dad supplied them with the guns for this film.
don't you mean. everything is great about hotfuzz.
will you ever do Bad Taste?
Would you please do Bolt. It’s a Disney movie that I think is forgotten more than it should.
I think only British people laughed at it.   ✋
Dalton low key swung for the fences
The noun “cop” is used to refer to a police officer because police officers who arrested people used to be said to have “coped” the person whom they had arrested; cop does not (and never has) stood for constable on patrol.
America Harry Potter is Percy Jackson
I did not know you covered this until now and thank you because I've watched this film like 20 times and I loved it every time even more every time I watched it over the years
8:50 as I'm sure anyone who lives in a village with a church can attest, the church is always visible.
Everything Great About District 9.
do at worlds end i dare you
funny how if you know the translation to the old git you can see the syntax evolution from whats said and what he actually said, reminds me of the Old miner from Blazing saddles with his old Cootspeak
this makes me chortel!
OMG, I can't believe all the celebrities I see you don't mention. Did you talk about Timothy Dalton or Bill Bailey??? Olivia Coleman?
Lee the world's end please
Somebody watched Every Frame A Painting
Small point at the beginning... Cop is actually a British word, so yes, cop still works. Comes from the slang to "cop" which means to grab or take. The police were referred to derogatively as coppers since they'll cop you. It can be seen again in slang like cop a feel or cop a look at this.
Whats Americas version of Harry Potter. Sorry Cinema wins, its Twlight ;)
New title suggestion. "everything about Hot Fuzz is great"
Please don’t say arsed again it’s like when an American says bloody it’s just pain physical and mental pain
F for Bob
you say what is the American version of Hogwarts. well it is ivlermorny
Damn that cute "hi dad" "hi buddy" just got me
08:17 I'm just supidly mad at the fact you didn't give a point for "Shaun of the Dead callback".
4:01 sound effect is from doctor who
What? My world is shattered. I always assumed you were just a disembodied voice and not an actual human.  Also: beautiful beard win
The scary bloody murder scenes
0:24 Coppers is what we call em sometimes
I’m gonna assume the little kid in the background of the raycon sponsorship bit is your son. He is so cute!!!! (:
to be fair to the randos in the village that didnt suspect skinner. if no one had died he woulda been the village funnyman. and as far as they knew it was all accidents.
perfect film
You guys seriously didn't spot Dwight?
40K tau  The greater good    THE GREATER GOOD
Would you ever be open to reviewing Rise of the Guardians? While it does have flaws, I personally think it’s a pretty good movie.
LESLEY TILLER WAS FUCKING MURDERED!
Had to make a second account and this one wasn't subbed sorry bout that just so you know I love your vids they make me smile
FUN FACT: This movie is a disguised documentary on everyday British life.
I also like how angel isn’t being a dick when danny asks a question he just answers it instead of saying something dumb like “you really are new” *puts on sunglasses
Could you do everything great with the iron giant or tv wins with doctor who Christmas specials or episodes pls thx
Rise of the guardians next please!
How Americans understand us British people
I mean if he becomes a seargent in Glostoshire, he doesn't have to travel long distances to attend the Prescott hill climb. WIN WIN RIGHT THERE.
In all reality, "cop" would actually make more sense as "constables on patrol" isn't really what the supposed acronym stands for. They are called "Coppers" in European countries, so cop is just a shortened version. "Constable on patrol" is actually somewhat of an insult. Just an FYI.
Nick Frost and Simon Segg are one of my favourite actors
PLEEEEEEASE do hitch hikers guide to the galaxy!!!!
I’m just waiting for the world end my personal favourite film in this whole trilogy
I’ve literally watched this film at least 50 times
13:00 he shoots all of them in the knee
possible reason for murders is foreshadowed at 10:49 in the movie, as headline of newspaper. But reality turns out to b pettiest
3:50 Why don't americans just eat burger ??? :)
3:59 frying everything. Just frying everything. That’s your thing that us brits mock you for
I live in Wells - the City this was filmed. (smallest City in the UK) The pub has a load of pictures of all the cast during filing. Watching this film even now is a surreal experience.
That, Sir, IS Bill Bailey.
Please do A Knight’s Tale!!
Why did i never know that the word cops came from constables on patrol??
I don't envy you doing this. I've seen this movie loads of times and I still notice something new every time I watch it
Straight line : __________________ Dotted line : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Iconic line : “I dunno, pub?”
12:05 just gonna put this here to take a look at Olivia Colman!
"You're a doctor, deal with it"
Nick Frosts alternate lines for the ‘drunk kid pisses on him’ scenes are hilarious....”collar matches the cuffs” is my personal fave 😂😂😂
This is my favorite movie 🎥
i love this movie and edgar wright so much but all i can focus on is HOW CUTE YOUR CHILD IS AHH
so thats what he looks like
You mentioned how the church is always sticking out from someone who lives in a  village like this the churches really do stand Out
I’ve just figured out something really weird Americans have no recognisable characters think about Britain Harry Potter James Bond Sherlock Holmes Doctor Who you don’t get any of those in America
All the times I’ve watched hot fuzz I’ve never noticed frank at the welcome party
maybe a little detail you may have missed. in shaun of the dead, pegg goes to jump over the fences as a shortcut, but fails miserably. in hot fuzz, he does it again, but it works. Dk if this is any good, just a little something
This film is everything Great about Britain encapsulated. All the regional stuff is right, the tone is perfect, the dialogue is fantastic, the acting is out the park, and the plot just nuanced enough to stake a claim of its own.
I live in England, I have a big bushy beard, I can’t tell you how many times people have shouted that Jim Broadbent line at me. It’s at least twice.
10:21 That's Bill Bailey. Very well known and very funny British comedian. Also from Somerset.
That's Walder Frey!
The color grading on your match cuts was satisfying.
They really should have used Ewan McGregor for bob's and dave's Hello there
Everything great about (pt 1)
Who is  lurch is he the big guy from Addams family
Having seen this film many times, I thought I picked up most of the sight and dialogue gags.  You pointed out a bunch more so that I must needs watch it again a couple of times.  Damn, this movie is like morphine ...
Hello there!
Martin blower is played by the same man who plays frank Gallagher in the uk shameless/ the best shameless absolutely mind blown when I found that out 😂 amazing actor. :EDIT: wrote this before you said dont upset frank thought you skipped it
It... It's Star Wars. America's Harry Potter is Star Wars
A brilliant example of comedic filmmaking.
Everything Great About Soul Surfer. Everything Great About Secretariat.
Your dog is absolutely adorable
8:30 you say you can always see the church and yeh won’t doubt it’s part of the filming but also..any village in England, anywhere you are you can almost always see the church as it’s the only tall structure and usual dead centre
Jude is the single most adorable being on the entire face of this planet Earth, i swear to god.
I’ve watched Hot Fuzz tons of times, but I STILL learned even more about the movie...lol.
15:15 Beautiful beard win. * *ding* *
Why does boone mention that when Nicholas says "that windows broken from the inside" he points directly at Janine, symbolising how she is heartbroken over Nicholas's lack of commitment to their relationship
Best Police movie ever
Please do worlds end
7:52 thanks man. You finally resolved the mistery of why I wasn't able to see that cameo.
Please do Dunkirk and 1917!
Angel ruined Stanford
It’s really hard to pick between this and Shaun of the dead as my favourite of the CT.
Did anybody else notice blanchett on the second watch
I don't know what to think. You don't look like my headcannon at all.  Shook. I'm shook.
I loved that they named the German Shepherd Saxon. Neat detail.
America's Harry Potter is Percy Jackson
Wow ... i dont know if he had done a previous face reveal but its cool to see the man behind the videos you love
You forgot when he said to Danny” u haven’t taken a shortcut before” and beforehand said to David in Shaun of the dead the exact same thing
This is great movie i watched with my uncle and i loved it i 10/10 recomend
Raycons suck, if you want to support CinemaWins, get em, but Taotronics are better.
Everything great about Serenity (2005)!!
I cannot BELIEVE that you missed out 'fingered *sniffs finger*'
Face reveal!!!!
Is that really you in the Raycons ad?
"Cop" isn't an initialism, and certainly doesn't mean "constable on patrol" :)
Lol I miss this era of weird humor in movies.
This is one of my favorite movies
So it's the UK version of Super Troopers 😆
Dude I'm sorry but Raycons are ass
See You Next Tuesday... lol nice
Cannot imagine that voice coming out of this person 15:17😂😂. Love your videos though💜. And Jude is soo cutee
Huh... i never knew the actor guy was Frank from Shameless until you pointed it out...
Eheh bunny thigh master 😆
When's your birthday? Huhuahuh *Win*
You should really do the worlds end
14:35 hes so excited and cute!! I love how much you love movies
"PUB"
Everything great about the worlds end.
Your match cuts at the end were dope
Americas Harry Potter is clearly the X-Men
Netflix’s Next Gen
Little one for you, when you were mentioning if you weren't sure if the term 'cop' would fit british policing, its short for the term copper, in reference to the original material the custodian(bell shaped) helmets were made from when the police first became a recognised service in victorian London, the whole idea of the helmet being that size and shape was to allow the constable to stand on it so he could peer over a crowd
You have to do The Worlds End and Paul.....please
Hot Fuzz good film? Yarp
Ha, u don't look like what I pictured, but kinda do......
Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever!
Why you look like me 😅
9:54  forgot  Walder Frey  from game of thrones
I love that, in the commentary, during Simon jumping the fences, they go "Simon aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand not Simon" during the final jump because, even though he did do the first jumps, he wasn't the one doing the flip.  They also mention that they have Nick Frost turn around after he slams through the fence because they wanted the audience to be 100% sure that it actually was him.
Does anyone know if Danny's mom was Mickey the Pikey's mom from Snatch??
One of my favorite movies i have so many inside jokes with my closest friend from this diamond in the rough masterpiece
Please do Ferris Beuller's day off!!! Love your videos!!!
15:49 He's eating the child!
Please never stop what youre doing. Im bombarded daily about how much everything I enjoy sucks to other people and then I come here and Im reminded why I love what I love. Top it off with pure genuine character and all around wholesomeness and yep, thats a win.
You mention that danny knows his mom's death was not an accident. I always thought him pretending to stab his eye was a way of saying he is pretending to be blind to what is happening.
8:49 nice
America’s Harry Potter? Hmmm.... X-men? Sorry I mean  X-Service.
This film was filmed in my city aswell
It's clear Raycon paid your son more for that ad while you sit there like an amateur
Bad new for the US but your Harry potter is Twilight and Hot Fuzz is a better love story than Twilight
I am confused. Is this a remake or am I suffering the Mandela effect of thinking that he already made a hot fuzz video?
shrek do shrek
America's Harry Potter: Captain America?
Jude is getting so big!! Happy holidays you guys!!
America’s Harry Potter is guns
Can you do cars 2?
"Hello There"  Me:... General Keno- wait wrong trilogy
why did you win smoking?
Yo, not only was that ray con matchcut smooth as hell, the fact that you have a face for the voice is gunna take a while for me to get used to.
the last samurai and kung fu hustle please
Everything Great About True Grit (2010)
Video one of ask to get the perks of being a wallflower a video
Me: I’ve seen and read about this movie so much, I can’t imagine there’s anything important left I don’t know.  This channel: btw they killed the old sergeant and that was his dead body at the end and Danny implies his mom’s death was a murder  Me: .......WHAT
The names of the different operations he's awarded for are a nod to the Bob Seger song 'Shakedown' from the Beverly Hills Cop movies.
Half arsed
Almost everything can be foreshadowed about this movie! This trilogy is probably my all time favorite!
You said so youngggg.
The sheer number of wickedly talented actors in this film is obscene! ...among those not even mentioned: Bill Bailey of "Black Books" fame...   Cate Blanchett is TDF!  Even behind that mask... those eyes! 💜 😍  Great video! Thank you.
Alot of people mistakenly think Hot Fuzz is a movie when it's actually a documentary!  great film 😊
Cant here you sucking on your "soda" hat (jk)
I already loved this movie but this guy highlighted details I've never paid attention to before and now I love it even more.
HE DID IT, HE FINALLY DID IT I ASKED 3 YEARS AGO. THANK YOU GOOD SIR!
This couldve been at least a 4 part series! This is my favorite movie of all time! P.S. the andys are my VERY FAVORITE!! They should have their own movie!
Another fun fact: Timothy Dalton when he says “of course, cheers”, he looks directly into the camera supposedly to mess with Edgar Wright. Edgar Wright decided to add in a cash register sound when Dalton looked into the camera in post just to mess with him back
Fun fact: Edgar Wright cut told Nick Frost to turn around after he smashed through the fence to make sure the audience knew it was actually him that did that stunt
Fun Fact:  Martin Blower the “terrible actor” is actually a great and you can really appreciate his skill in series/season 4 of ‘Ripper Street’ as Abel Croker and as Frank Gallagher in ‘Shameless’ (Original British version).
by the power of grayskull
You need to censor words like "Tits" and "cocks"? i mean they're vulgar but they're exactly swearwords...god youtube is lame AF
i really love how watching this make me appreciate alot of the movies I watch even more.
Going to have to give CinemaSins to CinemaWins for misspelling Shaun (as Shuan) and Parseltongue (as parcel)... ding.
Hot fuzz is such an amazing movie it takes two videos too talk about how great it is lmao
plz plz plz do worlds end it os a simon pegg movie
Ayyy im from this place, its actually the smallest city in England, fun fact
Are you and sins working together or something
Was really hoping for a States-side reaction to "Misterrrrrrrrrr Skinnerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr" !  Also I can't believe that CinemaWins Guy is actually Richard from @badobsessionmsport
You even included a Lethal Weapon Gag
Guns
Wait... does ‘Cop’ stand for ‘constables on patrol’?? I was today years old...
Also prisoner Zero has escaped and is impersonating a cop
6:50 aaaand this is why he needs to use the 'Bunny Thigh-master' everyday...
Requesting "The Princess Bride" Attempt number 39
Please do "the gentlemen" directed by guy richie
Kudos to you, this transition to the sponsor plug is among the greatest I've ever seen. Wright-worthy,  you might say...
Timothy Dalton's character, Simon Skinner, always appears with music that perfectly fits the scene...  "The Village Green Preservation Society" by The Kinks: as part of the soundtrack fades out as he jokes about being a slasher. "Romeo And Juliet" by Dire Straits: Skinner is listening to it in his car at the staged accident scene when the lovers' bodies are found "Fire" by The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown: also plays in Skinner's car, this time as he drives past the house that's been blown to pieces.
Please make everything great about JOJO RABBIT
3:59  Columbine
Timothy Dalton is realy good in this.
ngl I don't think taking up smoking for a movie deserves a win
Requesting "The Princess Bride" Attempt number 39
I know he's American but the way he said half arsed hurt
I see you directly stealing that analysis of the travel sequence from Every Frame A Painting, you ain't slick
I watched these backwards
Please can you do 'Stardust (2007) directed by Matthew Vaughn' It is one of my all time favourites
I just wanted to say. I discovered this channel about a year and a half ago. When I found out your wife was pregnant (clearly way after the fact) was when I discovered I had a child of my own and soon after gained full custody of her. Not only do I actually appreciate the ad space and relate to it, it warms my heart to see your boy develop such an energetic personality (as much as I know you dislike it sometimes) and he's genuinely older than I thought. You've been a source of positivity through the craziness that has been the last year and a half and thank you and good job to the two of you for raising such a happy human. Much love
I absolutely adore this movie, and this just helps me find more details to love about it!
Is the praise for Olivia Colman in part 2? It's in part 2, right?
America's Harry Potter is Star Wars.
Now that part 2 is up, I'm here to watch both parts x3
Teenagers drinking butter beer? Nah, British teens can drink Americans under the table. From experience that is
And I know this goes without saying, the guy with the earbuds is a wife win.
I hadnt seen this movie until I saw youd posted this, and wanted to watch this, so I watched the movie. Thank you. Thank you so much.
I swear I’ve seen this exact video years ago. Is this a reupload? If not I am fucking tripping
wow, i've never seen your face before this video, and i am surprised that you look just as wholesome and friendly as you sound! Nice beard also. beard win for sure.
So much here that I missed but a tiny detail that I love is at the start: "Hello Nicholas, how's the hand? ... I can call him but I promise hell just say the exact same thing I have!" "Hello, Nicholas. Hows the hand?"
I would really like to see an Everything Great About Jojo Rabbit!! I'm sure there's lots to pick through in there!!
15:45 awww cinema wins dad
I just gave thumb up for that truthfull and developing move at the end of showing your camera skillz while your kid is in the backround. #Everything GREAT About CinemaWins
OMG, Jude is so damn cute!!
You don't look at all like I expected.
America’s Harry Potter is the Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn
Disappointed that you brushed off Bill Bailey so casually!
American Harry Potter is Percy jackson
I didn't recognize him at first in this film, but i did see Steve Coogan in Disney's around the world in 80 days a few years before this film. Maybe you could win it someday
Jude’s gotten so big!
I never commented on your videos before but: MAN YOUR KID IS ADORABLE!!! Also the dog. Wish you all the best and thanks for the entertainment.
Okay, that's a toller right? That's gotta be a toller.
Can you please do the hobbit trilogy
America's harry potter is the X-men except Stan Lee never went on a rant about trans people.
I absolutely love Hot Fuzz, and I've always wanted to go through and see all the little details that make it so great. Thanks for putting in the work and showing it off in such an entertaining way!
Dunkirck, pls
Damn you didnt win how the romeo and juliet play here was making fun of baz luhrmans version-same costuming-choice of suicide-and even the song they sing is the one thats played during the credits.  Im going to guess nicks reaction was edgars reaction watching baz's take on romeo and juliet.
Show us more of your dog!!
EGA Lucky Number Slevin please!!!! or Mr Right!!
what i like about this movie is that I was filmed in wells, one of the smallest cities in england
First time I've actually seen your face, even if it is in profile.   Also kid screaming in the background, I can totally relate to as I'm having the same problem as I watch this.   Finally can I have your dog please??? Reminds me of the dog I had for almost 20 years.
Kinda bizarre finally seeing that awesome kid of yours! He seems great.  Pupper too. :]  Congratulations!  I've loved these videos for a long time now, and I think it's pretty incredible that you can help support your two little animals by doing something fun and positive! Your videos are always a little beacon of happiness and positivity that the world desperately needs.
Fuming that "what year?" "Every year" didn't deserve a win
americas harry potter is high school musical, we dont need to make fun
You know, I've said it before, your voice just does not match what I'd think you'd look like. It's so funny :D
Okay that settles it. I'm watching Hot Fuzz tomorrow
"How's the hand?" "Still a bit stiff" ( love the variations in the repeats)
What is American Harry Potter? Simple it's  The fast and the furious
The Princess Bride would be awesome
the Greater Good! part 2 of Cornetto trilogy
"hes never smiling" --- shows scene where they are definitely smiling
Ok so in the UK we call coppers Bobbys or Peelers (You see Peel House in the background in 2.34) It's  because British Prime Minister Robert Peel created the first police service in the UK in the 1800s
As if u edited "fugly" lmao
Video 13 of asking for Jurassic Park
Can’t believe you missed the detail that Skinner plays a song that connects him to every crime when they see him. “Romeo and Juliet” by the Dire Straights, “Fire” by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, etc. love the channel btw!
Please do the Matrix trilogy and/or first two Terminator movies!
Fantastic analysis!
This should be a three part series, always in the mood for Hot Fuzz (The greater good)
Nwa niggas with attitude
Please do a video on Hereditary!
What is America's Harry Potter? I think that's just Harry Potter. Could really use some context here.
Everything _Great_ about the Toy Story franchise I’ll wait
I seriously need you to do Rango one day
"The Greater Good?"  "The GREATER Good."  *Sounds like the Tau have already tainted this world with their cringe worthy ways, Commence Orbital Bombardment!*
Legend of the Guardians The Owls of Ga'Hoole!  That film was MADE to be done by you!
harry PLOtter is both a spoof and an American harry potter like literally he's an American who transfers to Hogwarts or something
You should do some classic movies like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
Could you some day do Speed Racer? I think it's a very underrated movie with some golden moments
How the fuck did i miss this? This is like my favorite movie  Edit: literally a minute in and hes already pointed out new little details i missed
Do everything great about the fifth element
Hello, I don't know if you review Netflix movies, but if you do, can you review Enola Holmes? It's about Sherlock Holmes's little sister.
Ya know you forgot to mention that nicholas angel (the main character) is named after music supervisor nick angel
Pls watch tag. It a good movie. Pls watch it and do a win on it. Pls pls pls
I have a few movies you should review, Penguins of Madagascar Madagascar Madagascar 2 And Madagascar 3.
The guy with all the firearms is named Webley, by the way.  Webley is a gun manufacturer.
Easily one of the best cop movies
Ah, but this movie is all about the greater good!
Ratatouille is one movie you need to review.
Can you please do 1917
Can you please do a Everything Great about "Spies In Disguise."
Ooooooo Murder Murder Murder
Pleaaaase do over the moon! It’s so good!
Also, I love the homophone joke with the ladies in the shop: 'Nice arse' and later 'Nice horse'.
And then there are the sound design jokes - in a movie that is spoofing/obsessed by American movies, Wright slips in some sound jokes, putting American sounds in the very parochial, rural British setting. The cicadas that sound in the evening as Nicholas waits at the railway station - we don't have those in the UK. The American truck horn noises - we don't have those in the UK. There's probably more....  I'm not sure a non-UK person would necessarily get those jokes.
YOOO! THATS WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE. WUT.
Whenever u get time..please do minority report
Everything GREAT With Speed Racer(2008) please!!!!
This video got me to watch hot fuzz for the first time, and I thank you so much! Plus, with this being a two parter, I wasn't even that spoiled for the ending!
You should cover the fast and furious series
Rango, you would fall in love with it
You look nothing like I imagined.
Please do Netflix’s Klaus, I know it isn’t the type of movie you would usually do but I think it adds emotion to the story of Santa and is perfect for something to watch over the holidays
Everything great about Cinema sins
I beg of you, watch the Speed Racer movie. Corridor Crew recently did a CG artists react to it. because I requested it. And they had some great things to say about it. The movie has the same amount of love and passion as the Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse movie does.
Can't wait for a TENET video (even if it isn't for a while)
A lot of the wins don't make sense, I'm sure they do to you, but they are not clear
Love this movie so much
one thing i noticed recently while angel and danny are in the corner shop was a poster of the killers' 'hot fuss' in the background  album title's self explanatory but it also seems to work well as a foreshadowing of the similar scene later on (where colette says "no luck catching them killers then")  i could be looking into it too much but it makes a lot of sense
This film, Robocop, and Die Hard are the best cop movies ever!
Do 'The New Mutants' I'm getting tired of people constantly shitting on the movie..... It's one of my favorites
The ‘incomprehensible British English’ might be the best part of the entire video especially since I understand it.
I haven’t had time to watch lately (exams and all) but I would like to say thank you so much for doing the hot fuzz movie!!!  Keep going with the amazing work!
Fun fact: The guy that plays the journalist with the terrible spelling is voice actor for Wheatley from Portal 2.
I always giggle at the incomprehensible British English guy going “Heh, cocks”
TENET TENET TENET TENET TENET TENET TENET !!!!!!
I don’t know if you already have a video planned for Christmas, but my little brothers and I were wondering if you could consider doing “Klaus” the Netflix original? It’s such a great, fun movie that is so winnable.
You should do a video on a movie called the devil all the time
Here's a challenge, everything great about Eragon, I think i am the only person in the world who loves that movie.
9:57 Why not call him Walder Frey then? Or even the dad from After Life?
12:40 you didn’t mention that this was unscripted and you can the actor in the back begin to crack up as he moves out of frame
do elf
Everything great about Tintin
I love you man when i hear your voice it randomly brings up nostalgia idk why but man i love you
Love the every frame a painting reference for the travel from city to country.
I really appreciate the extra effort put into the British pronunciation of half-arsed.
I was so happy about this coming to Netflix, loved it!
Please do V for Vendetta!!
I didn’t find your channel until very recently, I’ve binged so many of your videos in the last few days. Your videos give me permission to feel a sense of wonder and excitement about movies. These days everyone’s a critic and you can’t really enjoy things without being torn down. Your videos are one of the only things making me feel positive about life right now.
could you do everything great about MIB plissssssssssssssssss its a good movie
Has anybody told you, that you look like H. Jon Benjamin? The voice of Archer/Bob from Bob's Burgers?  Especially in the end of the video at 16:35 where you sit on the bed.
EYY, You got a duck tolling retriver! IM IN THE GANG HOMIEEEE
1.69 mil subs     nice
A place on the internet that's not focused on bashing things but just enjoying and celebrating them. Guess I'm going through all old videos.
If you are able to do Apollo 13 it would be greatly appreciated
Can't wait for The Worlds End
Anyone want to see a speed racer wins video
You should totally do The World’s End!
I suggest the Toy Story movies at some point, all 4.
When its so good that it needs more than 1 part
Love and monsters please
can u do a cinemawins...for a book...the answer is 42 if you get my drift
Make a video on the Matrix (1999).
As a former Gloucestershire native, you cannot begin to understand how spot-on perfect this film depicts it. It hits the rural-england atmosphere perfectly. One of the best comedies of all time.
YARP!
To this day I repeat, “the greater good” whenever I hear it.
Please do jingle jangle
your son is adorable
american assassin?
Could we get Percy Jackson?
MY FAVORITE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
American Harry Potter is absolutely American Pie
Since you did the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy I know it would be a lot of work so I understand if you don’t want to but could you do The Hobbit trilogy  as well I think those movies could benefit from a positive outlook for once
The greatest film of all time
Instead of constables on patrol call them rozzers or piggys
america's harry potter? being morbidly obese school shootings? ik you're gonna say we have shit teeth but that one isn't even true
Cinema wins are better than Cinema Sins >:3
Kind of a throwback here, but it's be great to watch a "Everything Great about The Rundown."  Love me some Dwayne Johnson.
Will you be taking part in #thankmas?  It has a lot to do with the channels aproach to things
ayy don't criticize English movies for referencing American movies you guys remake English shows and movies and ruin them
Would have appreciated a credit to every frame a painting but wh
Great vid man
I really wanna see a CinemaWins episode on one of the Indiana Jones films, particularly 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' or 'The Last Crusade!'
I like your beard, I might as well call it a beautiful beard
I think technically speaking, America's Harry Potter is Percy Jackson. Obviously not cinematically, but book wise... however if we are talking movies I would have to say hunger games.
Hell yeah I just watched it for the fourth time a few days ago. What timing.
hearing someone american saying half arsed sounds really weird to me lmao
This movie is hilarious. Plan on watchin’ Police Academy, anyone know if it’s just as funny as this?
Please do interstellar
Your dog and your son are absolutely ADORABLE
i actually didnt realize it was part one until the end XD
Worlds end next
You should totally do a movie on Inside man.
15:15 is that the face who's voice we have been hearing for year? Wow
If you used a good mic and put like a little effort into it people could understand what you're saying... Also Raycon is a scam!
GAH! You tricked me into watching that ad by making it adorable!
What a sweet child u got. I really like that you are mostly only apprecitsting all those movies. Not many are doing that. Like cinemasins... Great job u do!
6:28 *Shaun’s, only noticed because I spell my name the same way.
This is my favorite movie
Manny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wasn’t expecting to see the voice personified
10:02 I still love how it sounds like "arseholes", refering to the ones who were complaining, but it eventually just turns into "yes, I suppose"
*The Greater Good*
Nicholas Angle is Simon Pegg's best role... and he's great in everything!
Can I just point out that we say enforce the law in the uk
the outsider netflix original is super good,you should make a video abt it you reallt should
Crusty Jugglers
Everything GREAT About Hot Fuzz! Part 1. So you are showing the whole movie?
Can you do Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga!! JAJA DING DONG
Sea mine. Also, cops was originally British slang
One of the best films change my mind
I think a good movie you could review would be 'Interstate 60'. It is a small, lesser known movie (I believe) about finding yourself and what you were put on this planet to do. In other words, “an answer” to life.
Hey I know they are old movies but could you do the two magic movies Now You See Me and the sequel Now You See Me 2?
Gotta do the third in the series. The Worlds End is far less well known than Hot Fuzz but pretty good.
Hehsbs
everything great about the village please PLEASE
I have seen this movie a million times it’s great
Wheres part 2?
Please do a v for vendetta video eventually I will fund it in totality if I need to
I'd say America's Harry Potter would be the MCU (Widely popular adaptation with an amazing start that followed a generation of audience members for a 10 year journey where despite some rough patches in the middle, ended in a very financially/critically acclaimed two part finale where beloved characters die & the villain turns to dust)
everything great about tangled?
9:50 - Timestamp for Filch's [Incomprehensible British English] for reference :)
Awww, hahaha - how adorable the Raycon ad is! I seriously suspect he just told his son to jump around and make lots of noise while he filmed as a game, and the kid took it totally in stride! The golden retriever in the bedroom really helps sell it too!
Paul was great also. However Shaun Of The Dead was the greatest!
Don’t know if you’ve done this yet but Paul is another amazing one that’s funny as hell
I'd really love it if you did Darkest hour. It has gary oldman.
"The church always being in the background" is not so much a cinematic device as a characteristic of most European settlements.   In America, where every other building is taller than the church, over here it's the other way around...
We need the TMNT trilogy!
Best cinema wins ever also my favourite movie
Please when you're doing part videos. Release them at the same time... Otherwise its like a cash grab like Harry Potter or twilight
god hot fuzz is just the best movie
Hey, man! Can you do Django Unchained next after Hot Fuzzpart 2? Unless you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino?
Cop is a Britishism from the 1700's. To capture/seize. Derived from the latin Capio or Capere
Is it a bird, is it a plane...no its me asking for Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, please
This video should be 2 hrs 1 min long
im skipping this episode on purpose so i can watch the movie and then come back to it.
I'm pretty sure Yarp has become part of my daily vocabulary
Why didn't you win the it's a seamine joke
heyo can do you do a vid about rise of the guardians
What do US kids drink? Soda. Buckets of soda.
so a small correction from the commentary (one of 5 on the dvd by the way) one is Iain banks and the other one is Ian m banks, the slight difference in character is matched by the slight difference in author names.  also if you didnt know shaun of the dead has 4 commentaries on its dvd as well as a round up of what happens to all the characters such as Diane who chased after David with his leg after he was consumed, she fought through the zombie horde, climbed up a tree. passed out from exhaustion woke up  2 days later after the military passed by and survived.
Dear CW, please do an “everything great” video on Netflix’s The 12th Man ❤️
All time favourite film
It amazes me that the chap who played Frank in UK's shameless is in this.
OMG, you're child is adorable :D reminds me of my little bundle of adorable terror XD You're awesome, your content is awesome, keep being you, you rock :D
Have u ever seen run.?
Key word: everything
Road To Perdition. Its DEFINETLY dark but a great movie. nonetheless you really need to do it.
10:10 - Walder Frey was planning a major offensive in the North
best action movie ever
I watched this with my gf and she didn't like it. We are not together anymore.
I love your positive content on movies. Thank you for being here, it really helps.
I loved victors speech pattern in underworld made me love bill as an actor .......FU**IN yarp/narp is the hound?! Unbelievable
YES!
What about ending?
After this do happy death day because I watched happy death day 2u and I liked it and do freaky when it comes out on blue ray
Please do everything great about Superman Returns
Finally you are doing my favourite movie of all time
Missed that the fencejumping was a reference to Shaun of the dead too
Awesome! I need to watch Hot Fuzz again!
You need to the Nice Guys with Russell Crow and Ryan Gosling
Time to hear favourite youtuber praise my all-time favourite romcom.
Goddamn it YouTube why didn’t I get a notification for this!
That is an utterly superb ad read
Excellent, but sad to see you didn't win the dumbest joke of the whole film, when Angel is IDing the kids in the pub:  "When's your birthday?" "22nd February." "What year?" "Every year"
how much are vasectomies in america? i paid 100 dollars here in socialist utopia norway.
12:25 We wouldn't mention other British films when we're parodying American ones.
The flying high kick mortal kombat style to the 90 years grandma face who tried to kill officer Angel with a shotgun was also great 😂
9:53 he kinda looks like the 1st Doctor
Percy Jackson is definitely America's Harry Potter. Just... Didn't get as good of movies, but the books are better.
America doesn't have a Harry Potter because the school got shot up
Your kid's too adorable, add an extra win everytime on screen.
Steve Coogan wasn’t completely unknown. He starred in Around the World in 80 Days a few years even before this or Night at the Museum! Martin Freeman was also in Shaun of the Dead. For having done so few movies, him managing to get such a star studded cast was awesome!  Also, America doesn’t do ‘magic’, they do ‘people with genetic defects or survive impossible accidents, then become mutants or superheroes’. Lol
Guns. America’s Harry Potter is guns.
God these movies are perfect, even the alien one.
as soon as you said yvonne's mum i thought, "helloooo." lmaoooo
one of my favorite movies of all time along with the rest of the cornetto trilogy! praise from cinemaWINS? that's an instant click for me lol
Great movie growing up, still is.
Future requests if you haven't already done them somewhere out there: The Last Star Fighter; WIllow;  Lady Hawk, Enemy Mine;...And if you ever look at a series; The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. & My Love Story.
I think its mentioned somewhere in the DVD commentary, but the Danny character was originally supposed to be a woman and a love interest, and when they switched it being Nick Frost, they didn't really change any of the dialogue at all, which is why they come off as almost lovey-dovey.
@8:43: Let's just agree that Maryland Double Choc cookies are ALWAYS a win.
Wow that mandela effect telling me that CinemaWins has to have done Hot Fuzz years ago, it's an Edgar Wright film.
Could you do Coraline or Paranorman if you’ve got the time? They’re both really stylish and full of stuff to analyze, I think it’d be cool :)
face reveal!!!!!!!!
The 'actor' who plays the two parts in the Police Station is comedian Bill Bailey who comes from the same area of England as Simon Pegg and is a nod to the author Iain Banks who wrote two different genre's of books. In his fiction books he used his name "Iain Banks" and for Science Fiction books he used the name "Iain M. Banks" (including his middle initial). He also appeared in 'Spaced' with Simon Pegg as the owner of the comic book store he works in.
Quick side note: Leslie Tiller says she's just about to "pop off" before she's 'f*cking murdered', which is not only slang for going somewhere, but also to die. In case you didn't know 🙂
Could you maybe do one of the best movies ever? The Iron Giant? I love ur vids btw ur amazing keep at it
I'm gonna keep requesting it: "Your Name" or "A Silent Voice"
I love hot fuzz and Shaun of the dead
America's Harry Potter= Percy Jackson?
Can you please do everything great about legend and warrior they are my 2 favourite movies
I am Declan My name is Decan.
Am I the only one who is astonished by the fact of Cinemawins showing his face???
13:12 Can't believe that you didn't win the nob-shaped carvings next to PC Thatcher
I highly highly recommend watching the outtakes for this film
You should do Wargames.
Hows the hand?
This is my favourite comedy of all time. And my second favourite movie ever of all time. If a perfect movie exists, than this is it man. EVERY setup is paid off. Every object in frame every line of dialogue is a perfect piece of this story. It all just fits together so seamlessly.
rise of the gaurdians
Do the Austin Powers trilogy
Cutest. Ad. Ever.
Can you do midway
You are way more buff than my brain was picturing you.
This movie is so good
DETAILS! Skinner drives by after the first two murders and his car radio is playing songs that appropriate to each incident. I love that. Also I noticed how in the end of the movie, the bad guys had to swerve to avoid the swan and end up crashing, but when our guys reach the swan, angel manages to stop the car and avoid swerving off-road because as mentioned in the intro, Angel did a driving course in the beginning.
Please do everything great about elf
ahh you missed where the andes say "everyone and their mums's got a gun in the country", later on the farmer calls for his mum for back up  , and she busts down the door with gun in hand.
Can u make an opposite channel to Music Video Sins? But in your case Music Video Wins? Would love to hear your good opinions on artists and their music😊😊😊
U do no it’s called cop coz the British police wore copper on there hats, so it’s allowed song worry
LURCH IS THE HOUND?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??     (If I don’t get a reply saying ‘yarp’ I’ll genuinely be disappointed 😜)
Edgar Wright is the best director ever. And he's still so young...
I love this film, it somehow gets funnier every time I watch it.
Please, please do Napoleon Dynamite. Please. Also Edgar Wright is always a win.
Plz do Priest
Please do the movie Airplane!
So I know they’re your videos but I really think if you did the big lebowski it would tie the whole channel together
Please talk about Danny and Nicholas' budding romance, it may be a cop movie on the surface, but it's a love story underneath
So uh, this is great and all. But, a CinemaWins on Supernatural?
Can you do the worlds end too ?!
Okay, no idea what you mean by that sentence... 3:36 It's objectively grammatically weird and semantically obscure.
My favourite part is "a great big bushy beard". And I think "what year -every year" is one of the best lines, although it might be a common saying and not supposed to be that good. I know my picks are kind of dumb and random, but if I had to pick, it would be those, pretty much. Definitely "big bushy beard"! And Timothy Dalton smiling next to his picture of him smiling (and Timothy Dalton clearly enjoying it and smiling genuinely). Oh and the two sarcastic, cynical guys going out of the picture and coming in and going out again...
this has to be the best movie ever
Apologies if you covered it and I missed it, but the WPC who makes all the sexual innuendos is Oscar winner Olivia Colman.
We can all agree that sponsor ships are annoying, but this one was great. Why? Because he didn't just snap to it he slowly moved into it with the cuts
American Harry Potter-  Pumped up kicks
do  madagascar 2. Make my day.
2 parts and I have a 10 minute attention span. (Writing this after the 10 min mark of 1/2)
Your dog and kid are so cute omg 😭😭😭
WTF THE HOUND IS LURCH???
Best Edgar Wright Movie
I cannot see NWA and not think of.. ya know... NWA
As a British person, this is fantastic seeing an American try and go through a film so smothered in our kind of humour he actually researches  some jokes! not an insult or snide remark in any sense I just love how committed he is to understanding the film and doesn't just skip over them
Cop is still fine in the UK👌
A noise in the background everytime someone's being a moron: Every time we cut to the curly-haired cop at the check-in window and he has no clue what Angel is talking about, the phone rings.  When Skinner references his staff of grocery store idiots, there's a loud buzzer over the shot of them.
fun fact 9:55 is what any one who lives in selby soundscape like
It just sound wrong for people to say “arsed” when there not British or irish
I for one hate raycons and ads for them, so I thank you for putting it at the end
The Book of Life
Hot Fuzz is one of those movies that I can just imagine the entire cast and crew having a huge amount of fun making. Not to say they didn't work hard, there are so many well-known faces, even in minor roles, and everyone absolutely kills it, Timothy Dalton especially just comes across as enjoying every second of being Skinner.
PLEASE DO THE OUTSIDERS
The fact that I've now been verified that CinemaWins is a fan of Every Frame a Painting fills me with more joy than you can imagine.
your family is very cute, the doggo especially. but boy do I empathize with the need for a good pair of ear buds to block out the noise.
Beautiful beard win at the end there! Also please do an Everything Great About Speed Racer video.
Today I found out you watched spaced. Today is a good day.
Good Will Hunting!
are you gonna do pirates dead man's chuest? If so do you know when?
Been waiting for this one!!!!
fyi guys ive heard raycons suck heard from my friend that the reviews says that the sound cuts out and it glitching.
My favourite factoid about this film is that Angel was going to have a love interest in the first version of the script, but in the end Danny and the love interest were merged, so now Danny has a lot of the lines that the love interest was going to say :D
hated it the first time i saw it... i was hoping for a serious movie....second time...OMG...love this movie
Finally!!!!!
Love this movie. Gotta watch it again
Child reveal! CHILD REVEAL!
The only sin in this movie is that Danny asked of Angel wanted to watch Bad Boys II instead of the original.
Man I love this movie and i've only seen it once lol, omg you look exactly as you sound but at the same time you don't wtf?
I would love to see one of these with end of watch, such a great movie
You CAN understand the incomprehensible English with little difficulty though, it's just how they act and react around it that makes it incomprehensible!
Ilvermorny
dude ur such a dad
Write faster.
This is literally the most quotable movie, so many good one liners
Great advertisement! I'm broke and emotionally drained right now, so I'm not gonna buy anything, but I loved this face-reveal off you. And Jude has grown so fast!
The Harry Potter equivalent for the US is just you lot being dumb... That's literally it.
You don't look _anything_ like I imagined. I thought you were blonde! I don't know why, but I had a strong mental image of you as a blonde, Chris Evans-looking guy in his early 20s.
If you would have winned every great thing is this movie the video would end up longer then the movie
National treasure Olivia Coleman, making crude sexual references has to be a win surely.
Damn, I didn't actually notice that this was part 1 and was very sad, when the video ended soon as I had expected... "Hot Fuzz" is actually my favourite Edgar Wright movie... "Baby Driver" unfortunately had a drop of quality at a certain point
cant believe he didnt give a win for the joke about the kids birthday.   "what year?" "every year" LOLLL
Also 6:00 got me laughing hella hard—
Maybe it's coincidental but in the film Kill Me Three Times, Pegg's character gets stabbed in his left hand XD
AHAHA FINALLY
My favorite movie of all time! I'm so excited you are finally doing it!
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
Hot fuzz is one of my most fav movies ever.   Glad you did this in 2 parts.
2:10 No Star Wars reference win? That’s kinda sad honestly
"the greater good" tau intensifies
Opens video, sees raycon sponsor, closes video
YES! Finally reviewing my favorite movie!
Yessssssssssss HOT FUZZ WOO!!!!!!!!!
What du you think about the dead don't die with Adam driver ❓❓❓
There might be better comedies out there, but I honestly think Hot Fuzz is one of the best written comedies I've ever seen. Some of the joke set-ups are about an hour to the pay-offs.  The line about everyone and their mum having a gun, and the pay-off near the end with "Get 'im Mum!"  And as always, there's stuff I totally missed that you've clued me into.  Thank you!
What's America's Harry Potter? Unfortunately  the answer is definitely either Twilight or High School Musical
Do old guard next, it’s on Netflix
One thing i notice is that after nicholas talks to danny in the pub after being introduced to the people etc, nicholas starts to wear down a bit and starts becoming fun, the more noticeable part is when danny shows nick his notepad after pulling over martin blower, you see his eyess look at down at it in interest, there are some other scenes some i csnt remember but one i do remember and it kinda counts is the fair, when danny wants the nick to use the air riffle, he peer pressures him (in a nice way) to do it, and i feel like if he didnt have danny with him he wouldnt do it. There are other scenes but they left my head
Yay finally hot fuzz
That is, without a doubt, the best Raycon commercial I've ever seen. And I've seen...a lot of them.
What are the chances you redo the Bourne identity or finally finish the trilogy.
U should do the worlds end
He may be Bond to some people but to me he’s Prince Barin from Flash Gordon. That scene where he has to stick his hand in the tree stump for his test always scared me when I was younger yeesh
10:25 that's also Bill Bailey, one of the most funny and witty men alive today. His real live haircut is even more adventurous than depicted here ^^
I needed a laugh this morning... thank you for reminding me about the existence of this movie
Awwwe bebeh
Even censored, the church death is brutal!
Hunger Games America’s version of Harry Potter
I literally just bought a pair of Raycons, but imma use your code to get a pair for my dad
ABOUT TIME!!!!!
When are you gonna do Back To The Future?
What is the USA version of harry Potter easy the purge
Any chance of doing a CinemaWins video for Chef? or The Princess Bride?
Been watching all of your videos and I realized you have done interstellar yet??
I'VE BEEN WAITING TOO FRIGGIN' FOR THISSSS
hes actually doing the cornetto trilogy Pog
You really need to do a Cinemawins video on the new movie Greenland!!
I know that they pay well and this isn't ill willed towards the creators but don't buy Raycons they are overpriced garbage and there are lots of better alternatives. Cheers.
1.) Anyone that watched the original ‘The Office’ knows Martin Freeman as ‘Tim’ before Hitchhikers.  2.) That was the best product placement I’ve ever seen.  Well done!
It is not an exact match, but the a couple of the operation names match the the chorus to "Shake Down" from another cop movie, Beverly Hills Cop. Time stamp at chorus https://youtu.be/F3MTFJz50qc?t=68
Please do The Worlds End next i love that one.
The hound was lurch just blasted my brain holy shit
Percy Jackson is America’s Harry potter
Ah this is great. Fun fact, I live in the county this is based in.
I feel like watching Midsommer Murders has enhanced this movie for me, feels like this all could have been the plot of an episode.
The whole film is everything great about Hot Fuzz
so thats what you look like
Wins hugging his son was so pure
I was so happy for the acknowledgment of David Therfalls acting talent!
Adding the kiddo cuddle to the advert, always a win.
Whenever someone asks me about a good movie I (hopefully) remember to suggest "Hot Fuzz"... I too have watched it 14 times and it will never get old for me 😁😁😁
Please do Everything Great about Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief
Was waiting for this since the Sean of the dead one
America - here have our freedom with a side of lead
Yes, finally. The fact this is part 1 means this video is already factually correct
I use the phrase “I’spose” from this movie at least once a day. Top 10 favorite movie!
Aghhhhh noooo, you don’t look how I imagined you! 😘
An Everything great about Hot Fuzz should end up longer than the movie itself. Because you'll need to explain every single second of Hot Fuzz.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
but this is shorter than hot fuzz :P
Jesus Christ, this is a great movie. Kimi no Na wa is also a great movie _wink wink nudge nudge_
This better be a never ending series. This cannot be 2 or 3 parts
Anne Reid isn't dead!
"How can this be for the greater good?" "The Greater Good." *SHUT IT!!*
0:23 we do still use the word "cop" in the UK.
The greater good
YES FINALLLY! My favorite movie of all time!
4:00  UK problems: harry potter is too referenceable.   American problems: Should I allow myself to die from this injury/disease/etc or should I go bankrupt?
hell yea, HOT FUZZ!!!!
you make my day ngl
Please do some of Guy Ritchies films, more British gems! Snatch and The Gentlemen are particularly standout
How good does Timothy Dalton look back then. he could still pass for Bond if he wanted do
The entire film is great. This video could have been over in 2 seconds.
Please do Cars. :-D
My favourite film ever
Please review "What we do in the Shadows" O know you've seen it before, but people are seriously missing out not knowing about the gem
How is your voice YOUR  voice. It doesn’t match your dodgy at all
This might be my favorite comedy of all time. It is fucking PERFECT.
I think YouTube automatically deletes my comments if I mention a name because I’ve tried to comment several times so: 16 seconds, steals the scene.. more (your son’s name) please!
For some reason, YouTube is automatically deleting my comments
Please please please do the BTTF trilogy!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
YESSS!!!!! My all time favorite movie, i have been waiting for this 1.
Can quote so much of this movie with my best friend. On an average night out we probably recite 85% of the entire movie
Please do the IT movie
Please do Interstellar!
yes
My only note - I love this movie, I love that you're covering the trilogy, my only thing - he didn't "forget" the notepad in the car; he left it there intentionally. If I remember correctly (and I might not), Angel goes to see Leslie (god rest her) after he and Danny have the "YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWITCH OFF" argument. When Angel goes to Leslie (god rest her) to buy Danny flowers, he doesn't think of it as a work thing, but as a partner thing. He's taken that step to leave the notepad behind so he can just focus on Danny.  Rotten timing, though.
when you can, please do train to busan
Please do the gentleman ！
Hey she's not Cate Blanchet, she is Rebecca Fergusson ;)
Can you do everything great about Wonder (2017)?
Edward Woodward in a movie paying homage to The Wickerman!!!
The Matrix...obviously after Part 2. 😉😄
I'm going to have to watch this one again.
Missed win is where he does hand and grip strength exercises with the hand he was stabbed in
Everything great about Hott Fuzz: I live where it was filmed and love it
11:53 I never noticed it before, but even though it's only one person in the mirror, two reflections visible is a reference to there being multiple "killers, eh?"
“Wild West nut” says the guy murdering everyone to keep order for the greater good
ASBO's anti-social behaviour orders, not i suppose, thugs get ASBO's in the UK banning them from certain area's & shops with a picture of their scumbag face plastered in all the shop windows, ASBO's can last month's or year, sentenced with an antisocial behaviour order...
This made my day and it's currently 00:28 in the UK
Copper - Cop
Edward Woodward, the original Equalizer!
we do use the word cops in england! it comes from the copper or brass buttons they use to wear on their uniforms, i.e theirs a cop or copper chasing me....👮🚔
We do call them cops
Planet hulk?
Can you please do Klaus
Dude, what happened to your epic beard?
Please can we get an everything great about the Prince of Egypt!!!!!
not trying to be mean but gotta work on that posture my dude. That slight slouch will get you later in life. pop the chest out slightly and it'll straighten out your back.
Everything great about Interstellar Please it's a movie I love and CinemaSins got above 100 sins on it D;
Am I the only one who didn't know that the word "Cop" stood for Constables on Patrol?
Love my Raycons
The best of the trilogy by far.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO that's Marsha????!!!??!!!!!!!????????
That is the most adorable raycon advertisement.
Please big trouble in little china
I would argue America’s Harry Potter is the Percy Jackson Chronicles
Since it wasn't pointed out yet, I love the fact that Edgar Wright first had a female character Victoria written into it as a new love interest for Nicholas, but was cut out because the timing was bad. They did keep a lot of scenes and dialog and actually made a romantic score for just the two of them. They just made all the romantic scenes with Danny instead and only wrote them more fitting to his character. So technically this is a romantic comedy (which Edgard Wright did call it).
FINALLY!!!!
Yay! One of my favorite movies!! Please also do Hardcore Henry!
After so many years of watching, you're finally covering my favourite movie of all time, thankyou Cinema Wins <3
I cannot wait until part 2! This is honestly one of my favourite movies and as a UK (hogwarts) resident I can confirm that the film used to be on one of the main TV channels late at night constantly so it probably has a place on other UK peep's hearts too.
8:13 - Whoa whoa whoa! Are we not going to acknowledge that the fence bit is a callback from SHAWN OF THE DEAD? :D  The way Edgar Wright puts so much detail, so many easter eggs in his movie that you need to watch video essays like this to get them all... FAN...tastic! And the fact that this movie is not only a parody of action films, but, like SotD, is done perfectly enough to be added to the genre, is just amazing.
Star Wars Star Wars use our Harry Potter
You do NOT look at all as I expected.
T'au'va!
We wait for the cover of Raising Arizona, Please do, please do.
Please do the Super Mario Bros movie. I freaking love that mess of a movie.
Harry Potter is America’s Harry Potter.
The "twins" (the two characters manning the front desk played by Bill Bailey) are both reading novels by Iain (M.) Banks as you mentioned. Iain M. Banks was the name he used for his science-fiction works, Iain Banks was used for his fictions of the non-sciency kind. Both are great and he deservedly won many awards for both of his outputs. Also a massive supporter of Scottish independence but that's not important in this context I think.
Thank you for pointing out the Iain (M) Banks book gag. I have never noticed that before and I love it so much.
If you ever do "Everything Great About" Lethal Weapon 2 be sure to mention diplomatic immunity would have been revoked the second the bad guys stepped onto a German registered vessel. They would be under maritime law. :-)
NOOOOOOO!!!!! I just saw you for the first time, you've only ever been a voice... this is so weird hahaha
My favourite film of all time thank you for doing it justice and introducing more people to it again massive thank you man love the content btw
This is literally my single favorite film - I couldn't agree more that it can't be covered in just one part
Me, Seeing that Cinemawins did an EGA of Hot Fuzz: "Sweet"   When the title says part one: *Excitement intensifies*
yo face/dog reveal
You missed some details that I thought were intresting: The model village sign has a double meaning. Its obviously pointing to the actual small-scale model of the village but also its indicating that Sandford is a model village, as in it's perfect. Speaking of, Sandford comes from the example town name that actual police theory exams use. Its insane how much detail there is in this movie
Nick Frost may play a bumbling goof, but have you seen him in Into the Badlands? Brother's got some moves.
You missed Danny eating an actual cornetto at 7:45
I love how they got one of the most beautiful women in the industry to play a character where she’s entirely covered up and can only see her eyes 😂
If you're gonna Win everything in this one we might be in for a three-parter at the very least.
14th time watching the movie.... rookie numbers
(UK person here) why do you Americans have fake ID, can’t you just drink root beer it’s the same right?
Been waiting for this
Dude, I love ur channel, I’m begging u to please do The World’s End. This video made me rewatch Shaun of the Dead, this movie, and the World’s End and I think the last one is the most underrated of the 3. They’re all amazing and I think only u give them the credit they deserve
Do Prince of Egypt! What a forgotten masterpiece that is
Sweet jesus that raycon ad was absolutely adorable. Leesi is the sweetest girl and Jude is soul crushingly cute
Best EVERYTHING GREAT, ever... not just the attention to detail, but the flow that matches the flow of this amazingly complex film! Bravo!
Can you do fantastic beasts amd the crimes of grindelwald.
Secret Life of Walter Mitty! It’s one of my favorites!
This is completely unrelated, but I really want to see Everything GREAT About The Usual Suspects.
First time i saw how you looked in person , exactly how i thought you would from you lovely personality
please do Everything great about Sing street <3
Olivia Coleman is always a win!!
Your son really sells the match-cuts perfectly! Fantastic way to tie in a sponsorship mate :)
12:39 you can see Rafe Spall (i think thats his name) in the background start to crack a smile from the scene. 10/10
*The Gentlemen 2020 by Guy Ritchie* Hopefully you'll do that someday instead of just ignoring it.
When I saw it in theather I thought the 2nd act was a slog but looking back I simply love this movie. Especially the over the top gunplay. The 3rd act was a total payoff for slogging through the initial 2nd act.
Your child stole the show for me
Interstellar do it please you did rise of skywalker which was terrible and interstellar is amazing
extra point, the Model Village sign foreshadows the councils views on Sandford
This is, without a doubt, my favourite movie of all time. As a Brit I could watch it again and again and it still makes me cry with laughter!   Edgar Wright is ALWAYS a win...
YES    that is all I have to say and will say.
Ever taken a short cut before
I have seen this movie so many times and I don't think I ever noticed all of those background details before.   Now I love this movie even more.
Coulda sworn you already did hot fuzz. I guess your praise for anything edgar wright / simon pegg + nick frost related just mandela effected it.
Now if Raycon was able to disable kids instead of noise THAT would be a product I need.
The best part about this film is the fact that the murders are set up to look like accidents but when you get to the end of the film the murderers all accidentally die the way they set up the murders we see, a bear trap cuts off the bar keepers head, the mine in the police station blows my and then the guys head gets spiked by the roof of the church. Masterpiece
I can't believe you missed out the callback to Shaun of the Dead with the fence jumping!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYsdBE1_b-M
What breed of dog does he have?
Comment 10 of suggesting Love Simon
Is it bad that as someone from northern ireland i can completely understand the country british guy
My goodness, I would add at least 10 wins for Jude for his cameo at the end, even if that has zero to do with the movie.
2:30 explaining how wright does the bringing character from A to B thingy better than most people  Ah yes, I see you remember "Every Frame a Painting" as well.
Finally covered my favourite comedy
Every good with Kung fu hustle
Oh the decaffeinated joke is a reference to lethal weapon 1, a cop movie
If you want to do videos on more British films, I have a couple to recommend: Grabbers (Irish film about aliens), Robot Overlords (quarantine but with big robots and Sir Ben Kingsley), WolfWalkers (Irish animation about a Puritan girl and a wild wolf girl)
Hey, Nice match cuts.
no raycons for me, they dont even ship to australia. us/can, a little bit of europe.. thats it.
Can you please do Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas. It is an incredible movie and Eris alone is worth like 1000 wins :D
Glorious!!!
15:15 Beautiful beard win!
Have you considered doing motherless brooklyn? I loved it but the ratings on it weren't the best.
Piss taker is a Bart Simpson joke he pulled on Moe
Genuinely one of my favourite movies ever. Minus the murderous cult like neighbourhood watch alliance it just reminds me of home, small country town in rural England. Ah, home.
Please do Everything Great about The Room!
This might be the most well-constructed movie ever made.
You just playing the full movie, aren't ya? :)
Please please PLEASE do the Hobbit movies!
4:00 The magicians
Another fun inclusion for me was Stuart Wilson who played as Jack Travis in Lethal Weapon 3. He came off as charming delightful with a great smile while he was killing people. That memory flashing in my mind while he's playing as Dr. Robin Hatcher in this was *chef's kiss* perfect!
There are genuinely few movies in existence that are legitimately a work of genius. This is one of them.
I watch all of these and you really have a young beautiful voice. until the add about raycon and I finally saw you I honestly thought you were a teenager! amazing. meanwhile I've sounded like a 54 yr old man since I was 15
One thing that is bad about this movie: it ends
It's school not shooting range
Love that his first face reveal is in a sponsored section
Whoah never saw your face before
Just watched the movie thanks to you. I loved it. Brilliant
oh my god I feel old, jude (?) is so big   my heart man   thank you for these videos
In my absolute best Thor voice, upon seeing Hulk....  *YYYYESSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*  Edit: Also, upon my initial delight I completely forgot to make cogent points.  1) The Andes (Andy's?) are the source of some of my favorite comedic moments. Still, to this day, when I go to a local MLS match, I scream "WANKER" at opposing players in the same Andy voice (minus the cigarette).  2) I have possibly watched this movie and its various commentary tracks than any other film. Listening to Edgar's approach to the film, and the rapport everyone has...just magical. Watch all 3 commentary tracks on the Blu-Ray people: you won't be disappointed.  This film is #2 in my personal Top 5 films list. The more I watch it, the more I appreciate every storytelling nuance.
EGA Hunger Games Catching Fire
awwwwwwwwwwww.... they grw so fast..... (hank godzz9 just missing wif evea!
Please do La La Land!
I love Serious Actor Olivia Coleman just in the background making sex jokes the whole movie
Hi! Just wanted to say - I think you are a beautiful person and I love your channel! I always loved films and you taught me several new levels of appreciation for them. Thank you! <3
Damn i wanna see cinema wins react to "the world ends" who's with me
Oh! That's what CinemaWins guy looks like
My favorite of the 3 Cornettos Trilogy
CinemaWins gets a beautifull beared-win from me
America's version of Harry Potter i.e the drinks would be why do u lot drink litteral piss? (its a joke btw)
I clicked on this so quickly oh my god
one of my favourite dtails about this film is that as the film goes on Sgt Angel begins to understand PC walker and by the end of the film you he is speaking  normally
Ahh, it's a face
2:10 General Kenobi!
There's a reason  why this film is my favourite comedy of all time, if not favourite film. Every scene, every shot, every detail is meticulously planned. Everything is either a joke, or a set up for one, or foreshadowing or a call back. There is so many layers to it  as well as just being hilariously funny that you could watch any part and still enjoy it immensely. Oh and its set in the good ol' proper West Country!
this is not just a great buddy cop movie, its one of the best movies ever made. Edgar is a fucking genius man
Hot Fuzz is one of my favorite movies. My mother and I just watched hot Fuzz then World enders and then Shaun of the dead. 3 Evenings 3 Movies. We loved it. And mother didn't know them / forgot everything that happend. Its basically that everytime she sees a movie she sees it for the first time.
*shrug* the kids are about 14 to 15, and they can have a drink when accompanied by an adult at 16, and at 18 by them selves.  So most country pub do let them off.
Any one tell you have a GREAT BIG BUSHY BEARD
Also i think you can hear someone laughing (probably Edgar Wright) in the back ground in the fence scene when danny falls
Love the dog and child direction in your sponsor break :)
Know it may be hard to do since it's a show but have you considered everything great about the mandolorian?
omg! your voice barely sounds like the way you look, but it's also perfect at the same time? crazy!
Angel's ex was Cate Blanchett?! How could I miss this after probably billion times of rewatching?!
2:40 somebody's watched Every Frame a Painting's video on Edgar Wright
Before judging the origin of your word "cop", take a look at: http://orvillejenkins.com/words/cops.html#:~:text=The%20word%20%22cop%22%20is%20an,kapen%2C%20with%20a%20similar%20meaning.&text=The%20term%20%22copper%22%20was%20originally,word%20for%20a%20police%20officer.
There better be wins for Olivia Colman in part 2 because all of her moments in this movie are golden.
I've been waiting for this movie for sooo long! Thank you for finally doing it <3
Do EGA (everything great about) green street
Hot Fuzz is the most quotable movie, change my mind.
So,uh, Kung Fu Hustle?
Cop is from the English. It came from the Latin for capture capére, which became copper and then cop.
I know it !
What???? No wins for Olivia Colman?
"aaah..he's got shorts on"🤣
This movie is brilliant and I think everyone should watch it
I've seen this movie at least half a dozen times and this video is still showing me things I missed. If that's not the mark of a masterpiece I don't know what is.
This is one of my favorite movies, just for the level of details that went into it. <3
cute dog
I was hoping you would do Hot Fuzz! It's my favorite movie :D
Please do America made
Honestly love these videos, especially as you share the fan viewpoint.
So is the group of mothers a normal thing? Cause I was in Salisbury and I saw two groups of mothers just like that.  They walked up to each other like two armies and literally started a fight.  5 on five, each had a baby and one had twins.  Just yanking hair and screaming.  It was easily the best part of the trip.  I saw the Magna Carta that day I think, but I barely remember it.
Power rangers 1995 please
When someone asks me my favourite film I rarely remember this one but whenever I watch it or watch anything analysing it I'm like holy fucking shit what a masterpiece
Can you do Paul as well as World’s End? thanks
missed the best joke. "which year?", "every year"
Boy you need to work on your posture
Best Movie Of All Time
I missed so many brilliant details despite seeing this film like 10 times; thanks!
I hope there's a win for Olivia Colman in Part 2
Dog :D
Sorry my friends from the other side of the pond, but you don't have a US Harry Potter.....yet (maybe?)
I'd say America's Harry Potter is the Percy Jackson book franchise, not the movies they can burn.
8:53 - I thought this was a call back gesture by Nick Frost of Ed's orangutan impression in Shaun of the Dead.
Please do Attack The Block. More people need to know about this one
1|0):56 I quit my 9-5 thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Man I love this channel!
you gotta be joking i just ordered my raycon like couple of weeks ago and now they are 20% off
Do the whole Cornetto trilogy In one video
After Hot Fuzz can we get an Everything Great about Game Night 🙏🏾
Face reveal ^_^ You my sir have a beautiful beard!
You should definitely do Django Unchained
That was the most fun and adorable Ad and I am glad Hot Fuzz is getting the recognition it deserves
Man, I just noticed the big red subscribe button and asked out loud "Why am I not subscribed?" And hit it immediately.  Seriously love your stuff man, and love it when you do my favourite director.
Face reveal-ish Yay!
I love those match-cuts in your ad section :D
My favourite of the Cornetto Trilogy and my favourite comedy of all time. I never thought anything would best out Airplane or Monty Python and the Holy Grail, but this did it in spades.
Cant decide who is more adorable the kid or the doggy
Another one for the wins! When Nick censors the "cousin Sissy can go f-" it hides that she woulf say "himself" and connect it to Skinner.
;^)
I had not spotted the Iain M. Banks book before now! <3
Rewatching the movie, I realised that when Nicholas is riding on the horse, he looks like one of the winged hussars
12:06 OH MY GOD! IS THAT OLIVIA COLEMAN?!? GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!!! Oh shit! And her last name was Thatcher!
You have not mentioned Olivia Colman yet :(
Awesome. Nice to finally see a face to match the voice. You are amazing and I always look forward to your videos.
Seven psychopaths
A win for the double meaning of "Model" Village. MODEL: Use (a system, procedure, etc.) as an example to follow or imitate.
I will be adding to the choir, since there will be ton of comments about "you missed my favourite joke!" But the reveal of Yarp!'s lineage? Hello?
Yeah if there ever was a film that deserved the “this better be the full film” joke, it’s this one. One of the best films ever made
I love that little hug he gives his kid at the end, really shows how wholesome he is in real life!
Dude, I'd LOVE if you did the Speed Racer movie.
You should definitely do worlds end
Parcel tongue haha oops
"You Mothers" is my favorite line after "Fascist Hag"
two minutes in i realize i don't remember this movie to a point i need to re watch it , thanks!
THE GREATER GOOD
Anyone else getting Mandela Effect vibes? I could have sworn Cinemawins already made this video a year or two ago. I assumed this was a reupload.  And no I'm not confusing it with cinemasins, I never watch that crap
that fence flipping scene also happend in shaun of the dead
Could you please do ponyo next
I'd win the fact that all the people arrested or kill are all old English jobs. Slater, Plumber, Tiler, Weaver
Spirtied away
By the Nine, it feels like just yesterday I was watching your videos in my car when you announced Jude had been born. They sure grow up fast, don't they?
Hot Fuzz is my favourite film of all time. Edgar Wright is a genius.
I have watched this movie like at least 12 times and just got what splat the rat meant thanks to u
Who throws out Dire straits??
Thank you, truly for this. I've been waiting for this vid since the Scott Pilgrim one. I'm glad you're appreciating Edgar's work because it is just beautiful. I love your vids and keep up the good work! Also pls do The World's End
Oh my god, yes. I needed this. Hot Fuzz is the best of the Cornetto trilogy in my opinion.
I'd like to say please do more Edgar Wright but also the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies
I didn't realize how cute this guy is...
You forgot about Olivia Coleman?
11 year old in america  suugarrr playyy resesss 11 year olds in uk DRINK DRINK DRINK (downs wine)
nice beard!
Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg are just the best.
Yay!!!! This is my favorite!!!! I think I mentioned it actually in a comment a bit back.
When Bilbo, Alan Partridge, Davy Jones and Shaun were all in the same room...
Is it weird that this is my fav childhood film
Do Owls of Ga’Hoole next! PLEASE!!!!
Everyone in my family has seen this movie, and it's a miracle if we can go one day without quoting one thing from it
Thank you, this is my most favorite movie ever!
DO PRINCESS BRIDE!
Americans harry potter is percy jackson.
You forgot to give a beautiful beard win on the movies ad for raycon
Haven’t you already made this video
You missed the call back to the fences. In Hot Fuzz Simon Pegg clears it, in Shawn of the Dead the section he vaults over collapses, and in The World's End the entire fence falls over.
Finally doing one of the best movies ever
Came for the classic movie review, but really loved the family shots during the ad-break at the end.
It’s insane that this hasn’t already been covered I’m so surprised
This is easily one of the funniest movies I've seen, and it's still a riot so many years later 😊
sigh, i know everyone has to pay their bills but raycons are an actual scam
No win for my favourite line in the whole film?   "Very entertaining, but I rather think you've been watching too many films."  'Uhh... He hasn't.'
do the worlds end please
Kinda nice to see you finally! You look good!
No one gonna talk about how CinemaWins just dropped a face reveal?
Brother, wheres part 2? Its been 11 hours already. ;) Thirsssssty for greatnesssssss.....
Your killin me!!!!  Good job on part 1 though.  Looking forward to part 2.
You should do the 2014 film "Chef"!
One of my favorite things about this movie is the fact that you could totally read it straight as far as the plot goes with the NWA just offing whoever annoys them or makes the town look bad (and most of the ones we see die that weren't part of the main plot were, if you agree with the NWA, Sergeant Angel's fault since he went further than they would enforcing things.) OR you could also see it as skinner playing along with them to get what he wants (every murder of the main plot helps keep Skinner the main grocery guy in town, and thus helps him avoid losing a lot of money.) Edgar Wright does such a good job building a really fluid story with so many great aspects, it's really easy to wind up spending hours on the movie just thinking about the possibility
One of my favorites
Watching you with Jude was incredibly adorable.
I can't believe how you did not mention Lord of the Rings / Hobbit once during this video
Amazingly on point because I watched this movie for the first time two days ago and I realized I missed so many details. 😂
This movie is so incredible, and I'm always astounded with all Edgar and Co were able to get into the movie so perfectly.
Finally
Funnily enough, back when Shakespeare was actually running his own productions, the epilogue of plays like Hamlet and Macbeth would have an upbeat song and dance number featuring the cast, so that the audience wouldn't leave his shows feeling dejected.    So, while this performance of Romeo and Juliet was atrocious, the curtain call was very much accurate.
I don't know why i taught your kid would be a half demon😂. He's actually rrally adorable.   And please do a video on Stardust
Wholesome ass face reveal <3 (for me anyway)
To answer your question at 3:57 America’s Harry Potter is the Hunger Games
Greatest film ever made
How do you not add the entire scene of the crossword he called her a hag to her a phase and passed it off as helpfulness. Helpfulness insults
Please can you do tenet
Everything great about hot fuzz... The entire movie from opening to ending. There is not a single scene in the movie that is not great and full of detail
Awww! Jude is adorable! First time seeing him. I can't believe how old he is now. The first commercial I sat through without skipping cause it was so darn wholesome.
Your ad at the end is incredibly adorable! Love the match cuts.  Also, when Leslie is narrating the story of Cousin Sissy to Sgt Angel, he cuts her off right before she would've revealed that Cousin Sissy is not - as one would assume from the name alone - a lady, but a man!
America's harry potter? Idk, star Trek? Star Wars? Magic the Gathering?!?!
"A GREAT, BIG, BUSHY BEARD!" is a phrase I try to work in to my day-to-day life as much as is appropriate. That line delivery is great
Raycon should pay you extra! Great little add you made there. Also: can’t wait for part two. Edgar Wright is a movie genius.
"What is America's Harry Potter?"  While everyone else is saying is Percy Jackson, my answer would be if there was ever to be a spin-off series chronicling the adventures of the students at Ilvermorny (the North American wizarding school that was mentioned in the first Fantastic Beasts movie).
I like the space marine version of this movie and I can't wait for you to review "At worlds end"
MY LIFE IS FINALLY COMPLETE
that raycon ad was adorable
Will you be doing World's End to complete the Cornetto Trilogy?
I've been waiting for this for what feels like forever.
This hasn't been said enough, but I am so glad that you and your family are doing well. Stay safe!
I’m looking forward to “The Worlds End” review
About time also thank you
After years and years of thinking, and watching and etc I'm 100% This is my favourite movie.
kid is cute
Everything great about Kick-Ass
Best commerical EVER!!!
Do the Bill and Ted trilogy
Still waiting for Kung Fu Hustle
The review, as always, is amazing. But the clips at the end with your kid are adorable and made this entire video even better.
This is my favourite movie ever. I bought a peace lily because of this movie. It has six flowers on it at the moment 🙂
please do hitchhikers!!!
As for the Harry Potter puns, Rick Sanchez said it best "Comedy comes in 3s"
Do one for grand Budapest hotel
My favourite movie of all time!
12:35 the Andes walk off remind me of Sleepaway Camp from Dead Meat's video "the smarmiest middle finger ever"
Beautiful beard win **DING**
I can't believe you haven't reviewed Constantine.  Good job otherwise.
Whats America's Harry potter? Star wars
you should do galaxy quest and stranger than fictions. i'm worried about being tagged as a bot so i add this part.
1.The only Movie I would ever request since you've done the updated version. Peter Jackson's King Kong. It's one of my most favourite movies ever, The Score is so Distinctive there's almost nothing like it. The Practical work is insanely impressive it blows my Mind. the cast is so diversive and rich. The Digital work while some of it is dated stands up really well today! I don't know how much help I would be in making EGA Peter Jackson's King Kong 2005; short of me dinging everything I like which is *Everything* you would be remiss to me at least if you didn't acknowledge the Offical game of the Movie: It's a mostly original adventure that's Immersive with it's lack of a H.U.D with a Haunting score of it's own (Two Worlds is my favourite) The real only criticisms would be that it's like 3 hours long and some CG is dated or wonky at times. But to me and many other It's a Masterpiece in Worldbuilding and Creature design. Peter Jackson is a Genius 💜💀🖤
WOAH JUDE IS SO BIG WTF
I am ashamed that I didn't realize that not only would Jeremy look like he does, that classic Jeremy face structure, But also that he would have a moderately big very beautiful beard.  Win for unexpected continuity
American Harry Potter, is star wars.
How much sugar did you let Jude eat?
Damn, I need to watch Hellfjord again! Aaaand it's on Amazon, not Netflix. Just my luck.
Can we get an EGA Mad Max Fury Road?
I humbly ask that you please Win Animal Crackers
I honestly expected a 4 part series on Hot Fuzz alone. Truly love this movie. Even after the million times I watched it, I still discover things. 8:53 from this video alone showed death at the door when Nicholas is given concert tickets, foreshadowing the killings of the actors.
The truth https://www.bitchute.com/video/8306n9Jy0r6V/
I JUST SAW THIS MASTERPIECE THIS WEEK AND WENT TO SEE IF YOU HAD A VIDEO IMMEDIATELY... now you upload one?? Can you read minds..?
americas harry potter is percy jackson
Yooo when’s the beard reveal?
That's NOT how I pictured CinemaWins looking like. Still a DILF tho
I think Nick’s Lilly is fake and that really adds something they guy can’t turn off and the only thing outside work is fake and I really love how Danny wants to learn and be a better cop and he really cares about what is important
Jude is so big now. Wow, I remember when he had just been born and you talking about him on the channel :) congrats!
I'm confused, wasn't that kid in your sponsor part a newborn just a few weeks ago?
This is honestly one of the best movies ever made. The cinematography in particular is an absolute gold standard.
It's a testament to how many times I've seen Hot Fuzz that I understand every word of the "incomprehensible British English" now
We didn't need subtitle for the narrator. We needed subtitles for the movie.
yo I was just thinking that you should make a video  about hot fuz
this channel seems to be one of the most underrated channels i've come across. you talk about the GOOD things in movies rather than the bad, and you even do CC, which i know is very appreciated. so thank you for making these videos and keep up the great work
Also! you missed (or didn't mention at least) that the bad Romeo and Juliet play is in reference to Baz Luhrman's Romeo + Juliet. Note the knight and angel costumes they're wearing.  Seriously, this film is so, so clever, and definitely needs at least 12 watches to catch everything!
1) I love music/comedian Bill Bailey's cameo.  2) Thank you for blurring the er... "splat the rat." I struggle with watching it.  3) Your kid is adorable :)  4) If you think you have a hard time not comparing the British cast to harry potter, try comparing them to the cast of Doctor Who! Basically, I think EVERYONE from this movie has been in Doctor Who. Gotta love that BBC casting.
I love the insane level of detail that these movies have! I didn't see this until I saw them a couple times through. And there are Still hundreds that you still miss, until someone points out to you. A great example of genius movie making!
Do EGA the Insidious franchise Lee
The Greater Good
Please do one on “Paul” with Simon Nick Seth Rogan etc. Sooo many references and good moments
I thought Edgar Wright did the opening narration???
I have always wondered what he looks like
YESSSSS
Omg your kid is adorable 💖💖
Everything great with The Hobbit Trilogy
YOU DONT LOOK LIKE YOUR VOICE WHAT
I want skyfall for the next one I’ve seen all of the James Bond film this is good
Shame that raycons are shit
I was disappointed it was part one as hot fuzz is probably my all time favourite film. But since you’re doing it justice and noticing all the great details I’ve noticed after dozens of views I’m sure I can wait a week
10:20 I just realized that's Manny from Black Books! lol he needed a speaking role! Btw you should do one of these for Black Books, it's a really short series and it's all on youtube, I believe put up by the proper owners too.
Can we still get Kung Fu Hustle in a feature video?
American Harry Potter the lesser successful Percy Jackson haha
I know who Steve cougan and I'm not british
Bi-pass? I sense disaster bi!
Omg its a two parter
Easily one of the most rewatchable/my personal favorite movies of all time
The best of the underage drinks for me is the first one: Oy! When's your birthday? 22nd of February.  What year?  Every year!  I love this film and absolutely need to watch it again, very soon. Also Jude is stinkin adorable.
Your kid is ADORABLE
After watching Broadchurch I choked when I saw Olivia Colman goofing off in a police uniform
I need to see you actually talk on camera. I just can't match the voice I hear with the face I just saw in that ad.
i just wanted to say i’ve been watching for years and literally grew up watching you. thank you for being always a Win.
TINY GUY BEING TINY
As a west country lad I enjoy showing people from other parts of the UK the scene with Filch. I understand him perfectly, but if youre from anywhere else in the UK its still incomprehensible.
“everything great about hot fuzz” so you’re just gonna post the whole movie and hope we don’t notice?
That ad was the most adorable thing ever
I love this movie so much!!
*wonders how many times he watched the movie, to find more nuance than Mikey*  No one can praise this enough, the whole trio. Just brilliant movie making. And funny and worthy of all the hours I’ve spent watching them.
YESSSSSS FINALLY!!!! more edgar wright please.
Please do an EGA The Man from U.N.C.L.E.
Yo, not only was that ray con matchcut smooth as hell, the fact that you have a face for the voice is gunna take a while for me to get used to.
OMG @3:16 I've watched this movie multiple times. I've never noticed the connection between this joke and how the town leadership are actually subscribed to that ideology.
Jude has grown so much omg 🥺🥺🥺. Also you are the reason I watch so many Edgar Wright movies haha
This is why I love this trilogy so much. On the first watch its a good film. Second, third, fourth, twentieth it keeps getting better. Every rewatch beings out more subtle details that are easily missed. I didn't notice that all the villains are in the back of the shot. This trilogy is up there with the best films ever made no doubt at all. Pure gold with clever good comedy can't ask for more than that.
Not gonna lie. My raycons are awsome
Such a solid film that I have yet to buy. Shameful. Seperately, you don't look at all how I imagined. Lol
The "...incomprehensible British..." gag is based on a real policeman who transfered from London to rural England and had to be partnered with a local because he couldn't understand what most people were saying.
Weird, I always imagined you as a disembodied smiley face rather than an actual human
Please Please do The Wraith, Big Trouble in Little China and The Last Star Fighter.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!
You called your self a yank I can now use it In a sentence  The yanks make weird police movies
Hey, can you do Cloverfield?
Lee... where has your beard gone?!
I think that both Bill Bailey and Oscar winner Olivia Colman should also be always a win. I adore them both! I realise, as an American, you may not know who Bill Bailey is. He’s a wonderful and hilarious comedian who’s also one of those people who is just a GOOD person. His musicianship is also stellar. Check out his version of the Star Spangled Banner.
Yes! Yes! A thousand times yes!
Do (the world ends)
One if the first raycon ads I haven't skipped. Bravo.
Now You See Me/Rise of the Guardians. just to switch it up. Hot Fuzz is absolutely deserving of a 2-parter. Cheers
YASSSSSSSSS FUCKING WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO  So pleased your doing this after shaun
You should really do Wes Anderson’s filmography. Yes, I will do this every video from now until you do it.
When are you doing kung fu hustle
AVATAR by James Cameron
If this guy was British, he would've added a win for Danny giving the 'up yours' and saying "jog on"
he should have just played the whole film.
I knew Steve Coogan from Indian in the cupboard
Ah Lee! I’m so happy that you got round to Hot Fuzz, it’s my favourite movie! It makes me ecstatic to see your clear love for this movie. Can’t wait for part two!! 💞💞
Pleas do the trial of the Chicago 7
yyyyyeeeeeesssss just yeeesss
Can you do any one of Dan Brown novel movie adaptation?
oh boy I've been waiting for this
Your happy voice always brings me joy
Do Rango please! It's severely underrated and features great performances, excellent animation and a killer sound track.
You'd basically have to put the entire movie in the video
I've been waiting for you to look at my favourite film for ages :)
Still think this is Edgar Wright's best film, as much as I loved World's End. As alluded to in this video, you really do get more out of it with every re-watching, because there's just that many layers. Also, the fact that it's one of the only police movies I can think of where, A. there's actual paperwork and B. the police officers (those who aren't in the cult) *never kill anyone*.
I'm glad you're making this one a 2 parter. This movie doesn't get enough credit as it is, making sure you can cover all the bases on it is quite lovely
Everything great about Crazy stupid love!
Literally everything about this movie is great lol
You are the FIRST unseen youtuber who actually looks like he belongs to his voice.
"Get the best discount of the year on Raycons! Now through the end of November, go to https://buyraycon.com/cinemawins to get 20% off your order!" "(Part 1)" BOTH MEAN NO TEASER!!!
yo they didnt deserve that ad, lmfao call Raycon and be like bitch pay me double next time.
Please do interstellar!! The soundtrack is godlike, and the story is amazing
Hugging your child! +1
Gotta say, 2020 ain't the best year to be being so praiseful of cops...
I live about 15-30 minutes drive from where this was filmed. Yes, the locals really do talk like that and you'd be surprised how well loved this film is here and how many references to it get made all the time.
My grandmother lives in the village where this was filmed, and to this day I wonder if she’s part of the cult.
Kinda just like the subtle face reveal in the sponsorship ad
I've wanted this video for so long 🥳
One thing I just noticed if you were paying attention to how many times the greater good is said in this movie to Nicholas Angel you’d realise that the whole time they were trying to condition him into joining a cult
13:05 Simon Pegg/Nicholas Angel dropping the stodgy persona and being genuinely upset at the brutal murder. +1 win.
I've never had a film class personally, it's more of a hobby looking into all the little intricacies, bits and bobs that really make a film work, but I will say this.   If Hot Fuzz isn't used in film class as an example of the ideal film, it should be. Everything from the structure, pacing, use of techniques like Checkov's Gun and the absolutely stellar editing are beyond top-notch. No matter what kind of film you're making, or what aspect of filmmaking you're in, Hot Fuzz has an example of it you can take inspiration from and strive towards
At 3:00 in... I see we're both Every Frame A Painting Fans
you forgot the beautiful beard win at the end
This whole time in the graveyard scene I thought Danny was wearing a female police officer hat not his cowboy hat omg
I saw this movie last night
i need part 2 olease
i watched this movie and had such a fun time i went on a Simon Pegg movie binge
Oh yeah this is it
4:00 probably the closest American equivalent to harry potter is the hunger games
America’s Harry Potter is Percy Jackson, of course...
Please please PLEASE Do "The Matrix"
Not gonna mention the Neighborhood Watch alliance or the NWA share their initials with a certain rap/hip hop group, still one of my favourite jokes in the film
Holy fudge nuggets! Was this the first time we get to see the face of CinemaWins?
I was not expecting you to look like that......dunno what I did but, anyway...........
I JUST got the model village pun after all this years
Ok I'm researching and counting HP actors. Lol
👍 would have watched as a +30min video. Can’t wait for part 2! Really like this movie
I’m guessing the next one is “worlds end”
Hello. I love your video essays but I think they are too quick. The editing is too fast paced sometimes for me to understand what you had to say about the scene while also watching it. I love your videos a lot! Just some constructive criticism. Ps that ad at the end with your son running around while pairing it with match cuts was hilarious.
America's harry potter is definetly the fast and the furious series  You cant change my mind
Been waiting on this one.😂😂😂😍😍
Oh I have been waiting for this. Thank you!
what the fuck lol i literally looked up on YT yesterday if he made a video about this
How about the matrix trilogy?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! My favourite of the cornetto trilogy. Also, could you please do Atlantis: the lost Empire please? 😇
Part 1 you say? Awwww, HECK yes. :)
I just wanna see more of your dog ;)
Maybe my favorite Edgar wright movie
You should totally do “Everything Great about War of the Worlds” (Tom Cruise Version)
You missed the fence jumping scene as a callback to shaun of the dead mate
Part 1 of infinite
Just because,Harry Butthole Pussy Potter, is filled with British performance's. I don't know who the producer's were ? But it sounds American
Not gonna lie, I love when it's a two-parter. :D
Watched this film yesterday as I thought you’d be reviewing it soon. So good, was about my 5th viewing and you’ve still pointed out things I’ve missed.
The dinosaurs! Curse their inevitable betrayal.
6:27 it's "Shaun" actually.
Hell yeah
The female officer at 12:08 is played by the actress who plays Queen Elizabeth on The Crown. lol
CinemaWins is so much more wholesome and friendly to watch i like this guy
No "what? Never taken a short cut before?" Callback!? He wasn't a master flipper in Shaun of the Dead, that's for sure.
THANK YOU for giving this movie two parts. It REALLY deserves it and I hold this movie to high regard. #3 All-Time Cop Movie behind Lethal Weapon(#2) & Diehard(Which is a cop and Christmas movie).
ive been waiting for this all day.
9:56 parcel tongue lol :P excellent typo
You forgot about Bilbo’s famous TV show where he teams up with Dr. Strange. Love your videos BTW, doing great!
No waaaaaay THANK YOU , you golden God
EGA An American Tail* EGA Balto EGA Bolt EGA Cats Don't Dance EGA Despicable Me* EGA Hotel Transylvania* EGA Ice Age* EGA Over the Hedge EGA Ratchet & Clank EGA Robots EGA Shark Tale EGA Sing EGA Space Jam EGA Star Wars: The Clone Wars EGA Thunderbirds EGA Tom & Jerry: The Movie (*And videos for the sequels)
Raycon advert : beautiful beard win.
It is a truly fantastic film. Was filmed in the City of Wells in Somerset and since did live in the area, recognise a lot of the city as well to.  Also believe they asked if could film in Somerfield's (Was a supermarket chain, until brought by the COOP) and were granted permission to do so :D
For anyone who thinks the Farmer's accent is bit much, I raise you the Irish Sheep Farmer: https://youtu.be/jsUvcjk8J5c
Could you please narrate everything? I mean like in my life and stuff?
Just watch Nick Frost and Simon pegg Truth Seekers
I love how you have the callback to Sean of the Dead with the fence scene
Those match-cuts were impeccable, Edgar would be proud!
I noticed you didn't include any wins for the speeding car & subsequent note taking scene, yet referenced the note taking a few times in this video. Does that mean that there are no wins for that scene (something I highly doubt as it's great), or that you'll cover that part in the next video?
Tropic thunder
Fuckkkkk yeah
Raycon better pay extra for that beautiful beard win
You magnificent mad lad.
Are you doing the whole trilogy? mad respect..
Yesssss!!! My favorite movie ever!!!!!
Awesome !!!! finally
i literally watched this movie 2hrs ago & now this video is on my feed?!?
Serious? No mention of future Oscar winner liking a midnight gobble?
Ohhhh I get the feeling you're gonna regret teaching your son that...
This movie will alway be in my top 5! Love it.
Oof a CinemaWins face reveal! maybe 2020 hasn't been completely terrible
Woah man you are like older... You have a voice od a 22 year old!! I mean that in the most positive way possible
You should do worlds end next to complete the Cornetto trilogy
I think the American version of Harry Potter is Ender's Game: a beloved series of books that eventually ended with the message "if you don't want kids you will forever be unfulfilled" written by an overhyped author who deeply deeply hates LGBT+ people.  On a lighter note, Hot Fuzz is potentially my favourite movie ever and I am so glad you're covering it. Every single time I watch it I notice another joke, another small moment, another tiny attention to detail that makes me smile at just how much Edgar Wright puts into his films that go unnoticed most of the time. It's wonderful.
Yvonne’s mum is actually Tamsin greig
Can't click this video fast enough!
0:20 actually quite a lot of Brits say cop... Depends where you're from Personally I probably wouldn't use it but I know a lot that would
Have been waiting anxiously for you to do Hot Fuzz - your commentary always heightens my appreciation of films, even if I've seen them countless times.  Would love to see your take on Collateral
Do the movie filth
filmed in my hometown!
Did we just get a CinemaWins face reveal in a damn sponsored ad?
that little guy is growing up so fast :')
The Santa that stabbed Nicholas Angel at the start was Peter Jackson. Yes Lord Of The Rings director Peter Jackson
"what's america's harry potter?" off top of my head... die hard? *shrug*
My friends can't stand watching this film with me because every minute or so I say "oh this is my favourite part" or "no wait THIS is my favourite part" and "I love this part"
Holy crap man even your ads are wholesome.

Missed the Shaun of the Dead call back when they jump the fences in the garden...
The Cornetto Trilogy, the only trilogy where all 3 movies are the best of the trilogy :P
Idky but the vision of CinemaWins in my mind has always been; a clean shaven, built, college freshman that’s making videos in his dorm closet.
Every time I rewatch any of the movies in the Cornetto Trilogy, I start to think the one I just watched is the best one! Because I always find something new :)
Fun fact : the movie scene where they watch cop movies was the most expensive scene in the entire film. Because they had to get approval from both the company that made the movie and the actors in it. The most difficult movie was the one where there was a stunt double that only shows up for a few seconds, they went to great lengths to track him down.
I haven't seen the video yet but how many parts is this going to take? 1000000? This film is absolutely packed with the smallest of details and callbacks to itself and other films every scene and meanwhile it shifts constantly between like, 5 different genres. How were you able to make this video less than 5 hours long?
Yessssss finallyyyyyyy
You should finish the Bourne series. I rewatched your first one and the quality of your videos has definitely improved.
Please do world's end next
Seeing what you look like in the flesh I can’t help but feel that you would make a great mall Santa 🎅 good part time work and Christians is just round the corner!
MY FAVOURITE FILM OF ALL TIME!!!!!
Whoah I was not prepared for Lee to be a hot dad.
So hyped for Edgar Wrights Last Night in Soho next year
Jude running around and playing is so cute you have an adorable little guy!!
Hey, Beautiful Beard Win for CinemaWins.
This movie is one of the greatest movies my country has ever produced
it took me 5 watches and you pointing it out that Danny hinted about his moms suicide.. subtle, damn subtle...
FINALLY  I live in wells where this was filmed and have been waiting for this. Thankyou!!!
Edgar Wright's movies are the only ones that require more than one part. 🛎
America’s Harry Potter is the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Oh yes
Hoping others pointed this out, but you missed the Shawn of the Dead reference when they were jumping over fences chasing the shoplifter.
isn’t american harry potter just fantastic beasts?
Review King Arthur: Legend of the Sword
Please please do Everything Great about Push it is one of my favourite movies and doesnt get the credit it deserves
I really recommend the adventures of tintin
2:30 that's literally a point from every frame a painting's video on Edgar Wright, word for word   Great video essay, I highly recommend it
Not every brit has been in harry potter or James bond you know. Didn't mention that the code for the evidence room is 999 the number for the Police in the UK.
One of my favorite little gags is when the little drunk pays Danny for dropping him off at his mansion only for Angel to hand it back to the guy saying “And there’s your change.”
Percy Jackson is like the US equivalent of Harry Potter
PAUL PAUL PAUL PAUL PAUL
Martin Freeman SHOULD be best known in America as Tim from The Office.
Can you do bumblebee?
Holy crap. The # of actors in this movie.
Missed a win for “what’s the situation” even thought he has come to say he’s leaving he still puts the job first.
Next Time when you run out of Harry Potter references: Try Doctor Who ! That would have been another 10 ;P well 11 if one counts Filch twice since he is both an Alien on a Spaceship with Dinosaurs and the reimaging of the First Doctor
When will you Americans (sorry I mean yanks) stop making fun of people who are different from you.
The attention to detail in Hot Fuzz is staggering and unrivalled.
Could you do a CinemaWins on "About time", i think i would really enjoy a video on that topic
Hot Fuzz is THE BEST COP FLICK EVAH. Like, EVAH. Did I say EVAH? Yeah, EVAH!
I like how the waning/failing service on his phone kinda foreshadows the failing police service (not police force) that he is getting closer to during his journey. I phrased this terribly but take from it what you can
Cant wait for part 2! Hot Fuzz will always be one of my all time favourite films. Went to a review premiere and sung its praises when they asked for feedback. I had to ask for extra feedback forms bc I didn't have enough space to write my full reaction! As an ex media student, its great for analysing but also a fun buddy comedy with an amazing cast. You do always seen or hear something new with every watch.
Finally cinema wins does my favourite film AND its 2 parts. Am i dreaming????
I think this was the best Raycon add that I have seen on Youtube. Another 100 wins just for that
Fun fact(s) about this film: Edgar Wright consulted actual policemen about certain facts so he can be as close to real as a film can be, it got to the point where the officers told so much that if Wright had told their superiors how much they told him, the officers would get sacked. The town the film takes place in is actually used as a mock location to test how an officer would react to a situation i.e "there has been a collision in Sandford, what is the first thing you do when on scene?" Finally Doris is an old derogatory word for female officers, hence why Edgar used it as an in-joke.
12:06 "I dunno I quite like a little midnight gobble."  Academy Award winner Olivia Colman, ladies and gentlemen.
i only like this movie for one reason and that is that my nans house is in one scene lol
Everything great about Corpse Bride!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
America's Harry Potter would be Percy Jackson.
Please make EGA Love, Simon! It’s my favorite rom-com ever (also if you ever want to review any short TV shows, Good Omens is only 6 episodes and it’s AMAZING)
America's Harry Potter is the Percy Jackson books.
1:17 would have funny if he said “regardless of any animal or dogs trying to help me”
Seeing this Has made my day
Do you have a Nova Scotian duck toller!?
Can you please do Peter Pan (2003)? It’s so beautiful and the soundtrack is lovely and it has Jason Isaacs in it. My sisters and I love it.
Soooo I’ve been watching cinema wins fir about a year and admittedly I’ve missed a good amount of their vids but did they really just do their face reveal in an advertisement with no clickbait? That is a win. (Even if it isn’t true because I love you CinemaWins)
You should do Boondock Saints cus CinemaSins wont do it.
Cant believe you missed Villiage green preservation society by the kinks playing in the background of the jogging scene
AHHHHHHHH
I've watched this movie like 100 times and that is why Edgar Wright will always be my favourite director
Ah the cornetto trilogy, love it! Hey, YouTube, you got red on you..... (wrong movie but hey)
I just figured out that Frank Butterman is Roy Slater from Only fools and horses
Raycon Budget:  90% marketing 10% build/audio quality
When the house blows up, Nick Frost is wearing a Bristol Rovers (football team) t-shirt, their nickname is 'The Gas', thought that was cool detail/foreshadowing they hid in there!
I have just now noticed that this is the first CinemaWins video I've watched that's been released for less than 24 hours
Everything great about Janes Canerons Avatar!  Please?
YEAH finally
YO SAID SEE YOU NEXT TUESDAY!!!   AHHHHH  I’ve literally only ever heard that from my cousin and it’s become a subtle way to say... ya know in my family since!!!!  In fact I taught it to my principle back in high school after a verbal altercation with another student   I said “yeah a couple ‘see you next Tuesday’s’”   Him: “see you next Tuesday?”   Me: “yeah.. ya know. C... U.. nnnn..”  “....oh. Oh I like that”   Used to have a podcast that came out on Tuesday’s and that’s how we signed off “see you next Tuesday”
A 1 min video..... too bad. What is great about HIT FUZZ? E V E R Y T H I N G is great about Hot Fuzz.
It's subtle, but Danny also has an incredible memory. Angel is always checking his notes, Danny doesn't need to. And he remembers (even if he doesn't always understand) everything Angel tells him.
Cute kid you got there 😊 Greetings from one father to another.
Face reveal?
Paddington 2 Please.
The best film in the world hands down 👏🏻👏🏻
Ok, I know that you probably have a ton of films lined up, but I noticed you’ve been doing more Netflix stuff lately, and I really think that you should do a video for The Half of It.
Cant believe it took you so long to get to these films!! So glad you’ve gotten to them though can’t wait for part 2
I fucking love the Cornetto trilogy.
Hey Cinema Wins I highly recommend you do an Everything Great About for 12 Angry Men. It is such a well shot and performed movie with almost every scene feeling so real. It also has so many levels to observe with character relationships, alliances, and confrontations. I’m probably the only one who want this but figured why not comment on it :) Love what you do and keep being awesome!
Everything great about the world's end. That film has a special place in my heart as the filming took place in Letchworth UK, which was near where i grew up so please do that soon
That is the most adorable ad I've ever seen and may just get me to buy the product, well done
One of the less noticeable details I love about this film is that the farmer does actually speak English, and if you can tune your ears enough you can make out what he's saying even without Danny's help. I suppose it's easier for me because I'm from the southwest of England where the film is actually set, where there are people who actually talk like he does. I'm glad Edgar put that in, it makes me love this film even more
I cannot wait till you do worlds end
Yes yes yes !
The greater good....
Could you please do Your Name or Parasite, they're awesome and I'd love to see your take on them
Ray's Con.
That traveling montage win sounded a lot like the analysis by Every Frame A Painting. Don't think I wouldn't notice. I love this trilogy to death. I've seen that video a few times too many :)
You are the first person I've seen talk about this movie that ACTUALLY mentions the swords on the wall!
National Treasure 1/2, Matrix, and Arrival please! Awesome work.
James Bond, or, you know, Rassilon, The President of the Supreme Council of Gallifrey and All Her Dominions, Holder of the Wisdom of Rassilon, Preserver of the Matrix, Guardian of the Legacy of Omega, or simply, Lord President.
Please do warrior (2011)
Omg Usually my parents are telling me to watch movies but I told him to watch this movie and they absolutely adored it
you should review lock stock and two smoking barrels
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!! 2020 just became tolerable!!!! Been waiting for this for so long THANK YOU CINEMAWINS!!!!!!
Two parts? Makes sense?
MAN time goes by fast people get older and die. (I'm having extertrensel crisis right now) d.n.e.s_p.l.e.h
Fun fact: Dave was played by Edgar Wright
Still gotta do Interstellar
Hello CinemaWins. How's the hand?
Yo was that a motherflipping JOJO REFERENCE?
Simon Skinner, or Damien Drake?  Gotta love Looney Tunes Back in Action.  You even mentioned James Bond, who he basically parodied
You missed one, when they are showing Angel around the station the passcode for the evidence room is 999 (the British equivalent of 911)
Do not buy Raycon earbuds. They're cheap, Chinese earbuds rebranded as "high quality, yet affordable" earbuds.
God I love your stuff man thanks making everything, after watching these it makes me appreciate the films I love even more, or understand the films I didn’t quite get or enjoy.
Holy shit, JUDE IS SO CUUUUTE! I'm so happy to put a face to the face as well, albeit just a side angle. Love your work CinemaWins. I hope you keep blessing us with your positivity and awesomeness.
Do some more wes anderson movies please
The world's end is my favorite cornetto movie. It's so damn good. I hope you cover that one
Honestly, I've watch Hot Fuzz about 5 times as much as I've watched the other two movies in this trilogy. I love this trilogy so much that for fun I even made an infographic about them. So I'm am SOOOO freaking happy to see you talking about all the things I noticed as well. Love your vids, keep it up!
So happy, Remember asking for this a lot
Wow ! The stars must have aligned ! I rewatched this movie as early as yesterday night because i was like "huh, it feels like the right film to watch right now"
its like harry on drugs
Thank you for this.  Really, you brighten up my day
*incomprehensible british english*
I just watched the movie yesterday and searched up EGA Hot Fuzz and nothing came up. Today tho, my prayers have been answered
The twins reading the same author is even funnier when you realize that Iain Banks and Iain M Banks are officially different authors (one is a pseudonym he used while writing outside his normal genres)
Surprised you didn't talk about Olivia Coleman more. This film is just one of her long list of great minor roles that elevated her up the point of The Favourite and her winning the Oscar for playing Queen Anne. Would recommend to anyone wp likes historical-drama and British Comedy.
Americas Harry Potter are our comic book  super heroes. or star wars
Oh man, I finally saw what your face looks like 😃. I been watching your channel for the last four years; starting in 2016. I have some predictions of what you look like and I never pictured you wearing glasses 🤓. I’m not saying wearing glasses is bad because I used to wear glasses. It’s feels so good now that I know what you look like because for years I been wondering what you look like
Have you thought about doing Hamilton?
Lee is so hot
THAT MEANS THE WORLDS END IS NEXT, LETS BOO BOO
Two more pegg and frost movies; Paul and Slaughterhouse rulez
hell yeah
YESSSSSS
Oh yeah
That sponser segment is the first time I've seen what the channel owner looks like and I can't match his voice to his looks.
I LOVE JUNE SO MUCH AJFIWICIWIF
Watched Shaun of the Dead video JUST the other day, so this is very timely.
0:19 I quit my work with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Still hoping for everything great about a silent voice.
This is my semi irregular comment to remind you that Dark City needs discussion.
Needs more Bill Bailey wins I quote "Nobody tells me nuting" too many times to count
Hey love your channel
It's weird to see the man behind the voice :D
Requesting Jojo Rabbit and/or The Prince of Egypt. One understandably controversial, another criminally underrated.
"well actually official vocab guidelines state that we should refer to it as the service as force sounds too aggressive."
I’ll shorten the video down for those ho went to the comments first- It’s a fucking hilarious movie. WATCH IT OR YOU LOSE YOUR KNEE PRIVILEGES.
I know this joke is by no means original, but no other film is quite as deserving of the, "Just play the whole movie" comment as this one.
For the greater good
I absolutely love these guys. Shawn of the Dead is amazing
America's Harry Potter's: The Hunger Games and Twilight and I'm not even from the uk
i'm so happy to see the appreciation for this film and how damn good it is, it's absolutely one of my favourites and deserves all the recognition it gets and more. i can see you alluding to the Danny/Nick romance idea in this video and i'm really hoping you hone in on that in part two because Man it's so important and so wholesome in the way it's done
Man your beard makes you look healthy mid 30’s but your voice is like a college students
Sees new post. Me: Interesting. Sees the topic. Me: Is this . . . Is this really happening? Sees it is a two parter. Me: askdjfvnkaehriugmalkdm'lfma'oierjg
I love your channel and I’m overjoyed that you are doing my favourite movie of all time in multiple parts!! One thing to include in the next one if you have the opportunity: the shopkeeper asks Danny, “No luck catching them swans, then?” to which he replies “it’s just the one swan actually.”  That line is mirrored, “No luck catching the killer, then?” which gets the same response from Danny, but it is also the trigger for Nick Angel cracking the case! Also, it may be possible that there are many swans but I’ve never checked.
I can’t believe you didn’t win the “when’s your birthday?” “Every year!” Scene with the red headed guy
I know a professor in film studies in California who has his class watch this movie in his script writing class. There are NO filler moments in this script NONE. EVERY LINE is either a set up for a later joke, payoff, or reference (while also being a set up or payoff). (also and it gets me EVERY TIME is the car noise at the end when Angel revs the engine, there's a skipping BELT!!! Its that little bit of "normalcy" in what you know is an abnormal moment... Perfection)
Your family is so cool
I went on pilgrimage to the primary filming location of this movie (Wright’s hometown of Wells), and it honestly felt like coming home. I’ve seen this movie so many times so it’s great to see you covering it
Please add Atlantis the Lost Empire to the list. It's truly one of the Disney dark age classics! And it needs more love 🤗💜
America's harry potter is training day
5:25 You missed giving a point to that Catch me later Joke.
I'm so pumped for when you do world's end
Can you please do a video on The Big Lebowski? It's one of my favorite movies and my birthday is coming up
Good self restraint to not mention Olivia Coleman.
Lee you have a beautiful beard.
Never heard of this film. Glad you brought it to my attention. My usual pleading for this to be done: > Legend of Tarzan > Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey > Bumblebee > Jojo Rabbit > Rise of the Guardians  > Atlantis the Lost Empire
Not sure how true this is, but I heard danny looks back after crashing through the fence so that nick could prove he did the stunt
You hugging your son and letting us see it is a win 🥺☺️
I have also said it before: RAYCONS ARE GARBAGE!
dude honestly, thank you so much, love hot fuzz, practically know it word for word. been meaning to rewatch it but this will do massively
I love hot fuzz. It's actually so funny. But I need to give you one fact that you probably didn't know. There are no Somerfield's anymore they shut down awhile back.   And no, not everything in the UK is like Harry Potter, until you go into a shop and see the Harry Potter merchandise, that's when it's like HP.
Olivia Colman should be always a win
Can you do Everything Great About Dead Mans Chest?
your kid is frickin adorable
i am frecking thirlled
How about Mr. Right
15:16 Who is that?Oooooohhh...
Your kid makes a good Wreck-it Ralph
if you want paperwork, the tv classic "The Wire" is all about detectives doing the job in a realistic way. That means no shootouts, and all the paperwork.
This week will be the longest of 2020, and that's saying something! Waiting for part 2 patiently. Kudos sir!!!!
thanks for uploading, your videos help
YESSSSSSS
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD! ITS HERE! Thank you CW! ❤️
Knew it was gonna be multiple parts Cornetto trilogy movie can’t be covered in a single video
First of all, As a brit I love this. Second! JUDES GETTING SO BIG he's so cute 😍
My man looks like the most dad person ever
America's Harry Potter is gun violence.
Martin freeman was well known for the office at the time
JUDE IS GETTING SO BIG!!!!! Also loved the match cuts
Yes this is exactly what I wanted!
Hot Fuzz is a masterwork. Character building and progression, investigations, awesome story,  great action and fantastic directing. It's jam-packed with content, with no filler time at all.
everything
YES!!!! GOD I love this movie, thank you so much!!!
Probably my favorite movie ever
“Incomprehencible british english” Really made me laugh
SKID MARKS! (cue Rafe Spall giggling like a schoolboy...)
Can you do an EGA about Speed Racer?
tummen upp
Thank you for this. Made my month ♥️
Love the attention to detail 'Half-arsed' not 'half-assed' Appreciation coming from the UK
I love this movie
I remember I requested it several time. Thanks buddy, love this move so much
Coraline is my favorite movie of all time and I'd be so happy if you could win it!
This film made me a cinephile
You should win the movie Coraline next
8:30 no mention of the parallels in the cornetto trilogy
Coraline
Attempt 100(ish (I've really lost count)) of requesting Coraline!!!!!!!
I would be so psyched if you could win Coraline
I've only seen Timothy Dalton in three movies and he is easily in my tpp 10 best actors list
was the raycon ad the first time we’ve acc seen his face?
YOU HAVE A NICE BEARD
FINALLY!
Please win Coraline!!!!
Just put up the whole film, it is perfection!
Please please please please make an EGA for Coraline
Not to bring politics into this, but Danny and Nick's dynamic is exactly what people mean when they say nontoxic masculinity
Yes! I knew it!
I have to say...that sponsor of raycon and seeing your face for the first time and how you gave dinos to your son, it didnt made me buy raycons, but it convinced me content like this and, more importantly, people like you, should be acknowledge, and the only way i know i can help is becoming a patreon, which i will do right now.
Please do King Arthur legend of the sword and bright
Holy crap! You are the first YouTube commentary channel who actually matched how I thought you looked based on your voice!
I love the touches Edgar put in all his films, so many details I missed until I saw them here.  Hoping for Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or The Nice Guys at some point as I reckon Shane Black would also put in a lot of sneaky details as well that I'd never spot without help.
I love your stuff and understand the need for sponsors, but Raycons are seriously bad. Taotronics Soundliberty are way better and cost half us much.
Finding out that Lurch was the hound BLEW MY MIND!
YES!!!
why did i think your son was still a baby lmaoooo
Its nice to be able to learn a lot of cool things i never noticed or knew about a movie in one place. Keep up the good work! also, I wish I had a good Narrator voice like yours.
after the countless raycon ads I've seen, this is the one that convinced me to buy them!
You know how long it took me to realize that the actor who played the priest was the same guy who played Belloq from Raiders (Paul Freeman)
Wait Cinema Wins has a face?
This movie is so clever
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!
It's funny that you can tell a lot about a British person by how they know the actors from these films, but with Americans it's always "Harry Potter"
Forgot that Olivia Colman was in this.
nice but i hope you get over the harry potter gags in part 2
Holy crap! A side face reveal! (The first, I think)
please win a Beatles movie
u got a beautiful beard mate big ups from britain
Why, oh, why didn't you reference the fence jumping of Shaun of the Dead with this one? Including the progress Simon Pegg made here?... Now the whole video is worth only half the credit I wanna give... So here are your 14.523 Credits.
omg yes!!!!!!!! ive been waiting for this since your scott pilgrim videos
Simply...THANK YOU!!!!
I was today years old when I learnt the goddess cate Blanchett is in Daddy Wrights movie
Lee Referencing Tony's video essay about the Edgar Wright and the travel montage.
Crimes of Grindlewald? Pay tribute to Depp being removed from the cast?  (we all know who the villain of *that* story is)
*I’m not Jeanine.*
This film is perfect for a drinking game.
i dont know what i expected you to look like but it sure wasn't that
Leslie tiller was
After Part 2, please do The Matrix
OH YEAHHHHHH. Second movie in my favourite EVER trilogy. So glad you’re tackling these films!
Please say your gonna do At Worlds End too!!?? You have no idea how long ive been waitin for these!
Dude, this time, for real, EVERYTHING IS GREAT about the movie HOT FUZZ.
yes please cant wait to watch
I love this movie! Probably my favorite of the trilogy. The thing I didn’t know was that Martin Freeman was the narrator. I’ve seen this movie a dozen times. Love this movie! I’m looking forward to your part 2.
please do “everything great about ‘Rise of the Guardians’”      p l e a s e
Took you long enough
Wow...I did not expect to see you...
Oh yeah we love the c word over here
Good job on the match-cuts for the ad, and the ad in general. Looking forward to the wins on part 2.  By the way, have you ever shot your gun into the air and gone, "AAAAAHHHHHH!!!" ?
America's harry potter is percy jackson, your welcome
YES!
One of the BEST director commentaries EVER. If you haven't watched with the commentary with Wright and Pegg, you're missing so, so much!
OK OK OK YOU MISSED THIS ONE and I have to point this out because it is one of my favourite jokes in movie history: Placing the song "Lovefool" at the end of Romeo and Juliet at the first glance  only seems funny because it is a silly song at the end of a serious play, BUT the song "Lovefool" actually charted because it was used in Baz Luhrmann's "Romeo and Juliet", so there is also a whole other layer to this song. (See Todd in the Shadows Video on the song for reference) This is reference humour done right, where the joke even is funny, when you don't know the reference.
Am I going crazy or is this a reupload? Not complaining either way as I’m watching every single second of this video. It’s probably just because I watch so many YT videos on this film (my favourite comedy film and possibly film of all time)
Movie runtime is 121 minutes, this video is 16 of them, so we can expect 7-8 parts?
God I love this movie so much I cannot believe I missed the cape hung up in the background
This is great, 'cause I recently watched the movie and I loved it. It's now one of my favorite buddy cop movies ever!
Omg ladies and gents, it has happened.
That model village joke is so good
Do these guys know the folks of Cinemasins? Cause it’s kind of funny they get ahead of their videos. He’s doing Cornetto movies before Cinemasins, which I find hilarious
One of my favourite movies ❤️❤️❤️
Oh!! That cuddle with Jude there!! Aww!!! My heart melted!! It's so cute!! <3 <3 <3
I think the ad is the BEST thing about this video! Your little boy is so so so adorable!!
As an American our harry Potter is probably die hard or maybe fast and the furious
this is one of my favorite movies. Edgar Wright is a genius full stop no qualifiers.
Am I the only one, while valuing the entertainment factor, found this movie kind of pointless?  It was so easy to figure out who was behind the murders (it took less than half the film to figure it out), the group were the only people who benefited from it all and as someone from a small village I know how proud groups of people like this are about their places so it was obvious that they had to at least have one person having a hand in it, then as certain people became obvious but then alibied out for different murders meant it had to be the groups effort.
Hi! Pleeeeeeaaaase please please please do Next Gen next, it’s such a good movie! Also, I love your channel, I showed it to my dad and he religiously watches your videos now
Bloody hell this is the best depiction of police ever
lolll i thought i knew everything abt this movie - thx to rewatching, bloopers, extras, info frm imdb and the crazy amount of audio commentaries... and is2g i never even noticed the cricket bat until u pointed it out. looking frward to part 2! theres so much to be said abt this film!
Good film.     All Cops Are still Bad though.
you should do worlds end next
When they where filming this back in 06 cause it was a small budget they didn't shut the streets of for a lot of it and me and my dad saw the scene of simon pegg chasing the guy down the high street but he didn't realize it was a film as all he saw was a cop chasing a man and was about to tackle the criminal before he realized it was just a film. I'm glad he didn't fuck it up but would of been a interesting story if he had
Never clicked faster
That jude and Lee hug adorable
Why's it got to be 2 parts
God I love this movie. Watching this review, even censored made me remember how funny it could be.   However, one movie I also love which you guys NEED to do is Atlantis: The Lost Empire, it doesn't get as much love as is needed. They made A WHOLE LANGUAGE for it!
Ah, my favourite movie of all time. So glad to see it on this channel finally!
About time, this movie is a slice of fried gold
is Twilight American Harry Potter?
Your kid is adorable.
The best thing of all time is that my Mum grew up near where this film takes place, and she can understand all the characters flawlessly.
“Same actor” This makes me worried you don’t know who Bill Bailey is.
6:15 cracked up so much watching this scene in the movie
5:20, As you've said, I've rewatched this film so many times, caught so many new details each time, but Simon's "Catch me later" is one I've never caught haha
My favourite movie of all time glad ur finally doing it <3
Video: Everything GREAT About Hot Fuzz! Me: *this is gonna be a long one guys*
Attempt 2 of asking Cinemawins to do Wonder  Also I love this channel
4:01 probably Percy Jackson
Maybe it's not too late to request In Bruges (2008), probably my all-time favorite movie and just an amazing and layered black comedy with great performances by Ralph Fiennes, Brendan Gleeson and Collin Farrel
Hot Fuzz AND a face reveal?!? Today is a good day 💜💜
1.  That’s you?  You look nothing like I pictured.  Also explains  the beard appreciation.   2.  No judgement.  Great review.  ( So far.)  Keep up the good work.
GAHHH That segway into the sponsor was so spot on it made me scream in frustration because I never saw it coming! well. done. sir. -ding!-
Favourite bit of trivia: Edward Woodward, who plays the head of Neighbourhood Watch, is famous for a particular role. Sergeant Howie from the Wicker Man, where a city police officer arrives in a rural village with a dark secret in the grip of a murderous cult.
its 11pm im watching the 3 movies and after that im watching this see you tommorow
It's here... Finally here...
@CinemaWins Times Commented: 81 (Once for each EGA video that has been posted since I started. Only done on part 1 for multipart EGAs) First Video Commented On: Original Version of EGA Ready Player One (8/11/2018) My Vote For Future EGA: Everything GREAT About Disney’s Tarzan
First time I came across the movie was in Sao Tome (island west of Gabon, Africa), where they were showing the movie in the only movie theater in the country. I couldn't watch it there as it was too far and dangerous a walk at night. I later got the DVD. It's in my top 1%. My first Pegg movie.
"What is america's harry potter": school shootings
U should do fight club
‘Squeals like a little girl’

What's America's Harry Potter?    Sadly, Edward from Twilight
2:30 please tell me you've seen the Every Frame a Painting video called "how to do visual comedy", because you've basically given the abridged version of it! If not please go watch it! That goes for everybody!
Someone's been watching Every Frame a Painting. Good vid!
Why can’t they just drink Capri Suns?
EGA Spy (2015) Extended version, please!
Also prisoner Zero has escaped and is impersonating a cop
Pirates of the caribbean dead mans chest next please!
Multiple pints later: "It's hardly in keeping with the village's rustic aesthetic."
Edgar Wright did so well with the production values of this film. Hot Fuzz is still one of my favourite Christmas time comedies I watch. Every scene watched over & over again you pick up something new.  I loved the use of the uncredited actors as well as the established British actors such as Edward Woodward, Paul Freeman etc.  Small budget film but absolutely brilliant.
One of the best scenes is the old Sea mine that the old man bonked lol
Cop has never been an acronym of "Constables On Patrol" Nor is it, as commonly believed in England, a reference to copper helmets.  Cop meaning police is a shortened form of the noun copper, as in "one who cops", where cop is a verb from an old north british dialect meaning "to seize, catch, capture or arrest as a prisoner". The verb cop itself is of uncertain origin, perhaps from Middle French caper "seize, to take," from Latin capere "to take", from Dutch kapen "to take," or from Old Frisian capia "to buy."  https://www.etymonline.com/word/cop?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_19052
You may know him as bond, he'll always be Rassilon to me. Yeh that's right, last time it was Harriet Jones former priminister, this week is president of the Timelords, I'm just saving David Bradley for next time, I'll let you decide which reference I end up going for
This is actually just a copy of amazing article from Tumblr but I think you should read it because it really has a point (a lot of points lol).  Author:  pennyapound on Tumblr  "Here’s the thing, Hot Fuzz is an action/comedy/thriller spoof that also happens to have a love story between two men. As in actual romantic love. How do I know? Because of Victoria. Most people who are fans of Hot Fuzz know that Nicolas was supposed to have a female love interest named Victoria. However, when Wright started working on how to film the script he realised the movie would be way too long, so he and Pegg decided to cut out Victoria. She took up way too much time despite not being important to the main mystery plot, but the romantic subplot of Nicolas having to learn to truly love another human being had become too integral to his character development. They fixed this problem by giving the majority of Victoria’s scenes and dialogue to Danny. In other words, they made Danny the love interest. All those scenes with Nicolas and Danny that seem romantic ARE romantic. They were written to be explicitly romantic, but because the words are coming out of Danny, a man, instead of Victoria people think it’s supposed to be a joke. Try imagining Danny being played by a woman in those scenes. Are they still funny or just straight up romantic scenes? (Well, except for the obvious jokey jokes) Wright and Pegg weren’t messing around with this. They spend a fortune on Nicolas and Danny’s romantic theme music because they hired an actual orchestra to give it the right weight and feel (all other music in the movie was made much cheaper on computers). It plays in the background during the scene where they talk about why they became cops, when they sit on the couch and Nicolas talk about his past failings as a boyfriend, and when they make up after fighting. The whole peace lily plot was lifted directly from Victoria. Nicolas buys her the flower, but doesn’t realise that it’s a romantic gesture until the owner of the shop asks him if it’s “for someone special”. He thinks for a moment before saying “Yes it is”. That was the moment Nicolas realised he was in love. Nothing was changed in the final film except he’s talking about Danny. When Nicolas tells the other police officers that he bought flowers for Danny, the room goes silent for half a second. Doris is seen with a knowing smile. Nicolas and Danny’s relationships is framed as romantic before they even meet. When Nicolas’ ex girlfriend, Janine, tells him to find someone he can “care more about than work” she clearly means a romantic partner. They are talking about their own failed relationship and she encourages him to find someone he can love more than he loved her. Nicolas later confess to Danny that he kept forgetting Janine’s birthday, and is deeply upset when he finds out he almost missed Danny’s birthday later. A clear connection is made between Nicolas’ past romantic relationships and Danny. The monkey plushy plot was added to make the romance more true to Danny. Not only is it in line with Danny’s character that he would love a gift that Nicolas won for him by using his superior shooting skills, it’s also a classic romantic gesture. The focus is so heavily on Nicolas picking up a weapon for the first time in years we don’t realise it’s a classic case of “guy winning a plushy for his crush” until later when Danny gives the monkey back and Nicolas gets sad, saying he won it for Danny. It can feel like they are just spoofing the bromances of past action movies, and no doubt it was part of the motivation for giving the romantic subplot to Danny. But they’re not just going “Look, we can do that too!” They took these odd homoerotic “no homo” relationships and mocked them by making it an actually deep felt, important and serious love between two men. They don’t accidentally touch and have homophobic panic attacks. They snuggle up on the sofa. Interestingly the big reference to Point Break in Hot Fuzz doesn’t compare Johnny and Bodhi’s infamous platonic love to Nicolas and Danny’s relationship. Instead it compares them to Danny and his dad, keeping it intense but platonic. After all this you might be thinking “If their relationship is supposed to be romantic, why don’t they kiss?” People don’t kiss in the Cornetto Trilogy. Don’t ask me why, but romantic relationships aren’t sealed with onscreen kisses in this series. Not even Shaun and Liz kissed in Shaun of The Dead despite having dated for three years. “Both Nicolas and Danny are shown to be straight. Nicolas was about to marry Janine and Danny says he had a crush on a woman in town” All I can say is that if you think this, you don’t know Simon Pegg’s movies. You could say bisexual/biromantic men are a very common occurrence in his works, but in reality his views on sex and romance seem more muddled than that. If you sit down and watch all the movies and shows he had a hand in writing it becomes clear that he considers those things very fluid and blurry. Mike from Spaced slept with Marsha and would have ended up with Dexter if the series had gotten another season. He’s also clearly in love with Tim who doesn’t feel any sexual attraction to Mike, but he loves Mike and they’re seen holding hands (Tim is an insecure fuckboy though. Despite his relationship with Mike he reacts with low-key homophobia to other men having similar relationships, and despite Tim liking to wear women’s clothes when he’s alone he dismissively calls Vulva a tranny). Like I said, sexuality and romance are blurred in Simon Pegg’s works and can either be interconnected or separate and people don’t always fit neatly into straight, gay or even bisexual boxes. So what I’m saying is that Nicolas and Danny are without a doubt romantically in love, but I won’t make any judgement on wether they’re sexually attracted to each other. The movie doesn’t suggest anything either way, but then again neither did Shaun of The Dead. For all we know Shaun and Liz were asexual. Wright and Pegg were asked what they thought of all the Hot Fuzz slash fiction and responded that technically they had written their own Hot Fuzz slash fiction: the manuscript for the movie. I’ll leave it at that."
why is no-one talking about the cute puppy
My goodness Raycon is just everywhere. Props to them, it must be working if they keep getting everyone they can on youtube advertising for them.  Anyways, great look at a great movie. Will look forward to part 2.
That was the first time I've seen your face and that was jarring. But cool! Also wow Jude is huge, I feels like only a few months ago you announced Julia was pregnant, time flys.
How have you only done this now
Love this movie
ok first time seeing your face and holy shit you look way way waaaaaay older then i always thought.....maybe because of the beard.....also....beautiful beardwin.
There aren’t as many stars in the sky as there are times I’ve watched Hot Fuzz
A fine choice! I just wish I didn't have endure your goofy, Ned Flanders voice to get through it. Can't have everything I suppose.
Been asking for 2 years PLEASE do *BLINDSPOTTING (2018)*
So happy you did this!!
hey awesome video! can you please do EGA pirates of the caribbean 2 & 3? you did a 2 part video on the first and it's easy to notice how much you appriciate those movies' and i was hoping you'll do some justice with the second and third, which are greatly underrated (mostly the third) and your the only one who can save them! thanks a lot
Wait. Since when is your majestic beard so short?
That movie is a masterpiece, not even kidding. And I was so surprised to see you ! I definitely did not imagine you like that ! Can't wait for part 2
Quality film
Wait that's you? Have you given yourself a beautiful beard win already?
American Harry Potter is Percy Jackson.
Bill Bailey was in this and i did not see him until you pointed it out, shit the cornetto trilogy can now set it's own reenactment of black books
I hate your cabinets. You either have non painted wood, or no wood at all.
Interstellar
If you didn't buy raycons after that ad you're heartless.
Woaaah! That's what you look like?!
oh my god it's THE CUTEST SPONSOR PART EVER MADE! also, great work on the match cuts! also also, nice to meet you in form! also also also, I see your keep Olivia Colman's prasing to part 2 ;)
everything Great about The world's end?
When you're say arsed in english english americans like you did here hit the R too hard. It's not arrrsed it's more like aassed
If he don't do a bounse around for every mashup  Same face in picture  Cop refuse  And plan English stuff  Ill be disappointed
I love this movie. One of my favorites and my favorite from the Cornetto. The bromance is the best.
Jude is so adorable. We need more of him in these videos. Like for animation :D
Rec: Rango and/or Rise of the Guardians Please?  (OH MY GOD YOUR SON IS ADORABLE)
i might be a dummy, but this is the first time ive seen you! nice to meet you and hope you and your family are doing well! 💖
The only time i didnt skip the ad
Another censorship, another dislike.   You are disrespecting art
I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this film and I still notice some new little details every time. Edgar Wright is a genius
can i give a cute win cause your kid is absolutely adorable
Did you credit "Every Frame a Painting"?
Jude is heckin' adorable. That is all.  Actually, let's say it like this: "Jude is and always will be a win."
True story - I confused this with 'Shaun of the Dead' and kept waiting for the zombies to show up. I thought the opening crime scene was done by a zombie. Then that the guy at B&B was dead by a zombie. Then that the guy who would be held in the cell overnight would wake up a zombie. Then the car crash/decapitation. Basically, for the first hour, I was waiting for zombies.
Everything great about spirit! Stallion of the Cimarron!!!!!!!!!!
I always wondered how Americans felt about these films, if there are any jokes not understood or interests, reply with them, I’m interested.
THANK! Jacksepticeye’s favourite film is here :)
Wow. A 2 parter. You know another video you should make that might have to be a 2 parter? Titanic. Please do titanic.
Timothy Dalton was such a joy in this movie.  He was so good.
Lee I need to see you speak before I believe you sound the way you do while looking like you do.
Finally been waiting so long for this
yeah
Quick note, he keeps adding to the number of times through the movie. 4 near the beginning and 14 near the end
Greatest film of all time.
Someone is a fan of Every Frame A Painting
Please CinemaWins please do a video on PAUL. It’s the same bros as in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. And honestly it’s my favorite out of the 3
Awww yes here we go!!! Also.. Most adorable ad-read ever!
Every time I watch this movie I pick up a new detail, and this time it was the black cape in the background! Never noticed that before. Since this is part 1, I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I hope to god you don't miss one of the most important details of the movie. The "swan chase" itself is the parody of the whole movie plot. It's a whole wild goose chase. They are chasing the swan throughout the village, just like Nicholas is chasing the killers all around him, and yes, most of the time they are in front of him, and he can never catch them!
THE GREATER GOOD!!! 😶
Edgar Wright <3 <3
Can you please do Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter? Also please do Doctor Sleep. That movie is a gem and did not get the love it deserves.
I loved the video but man I LIVE for the match cut compilation with you and your beautiful family
So casual face reveal is casual. Voice girly man Looks manly man
How dare you not mention anything about Olivia Coleman sir... shame!
I uhhh. Am realizing this is the first time I’ve seen you or Jude ever besides that one photo of Jude years ago. Did not expect that to be how everything looked😳
As someone who is from the British countryside I can 100% understand what 'Filch' is saying in this movie 😂 I love this film so much it never gets old!
Every single time I watch this film I spot something new and brilliant. The attention to detail is out of this world. The only thing that can possibly come close to the same level of little details, easter eggs, and straight up dad jokes has got to be Wallace and Gromit.
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Love Actually, two movies you really need to do
So that's what he looks like...
i've only just realised that Anne Reid is also the person who plays the plasmavore in smith and jones.
What do Hitchhiker's Guide, Hot Fuzz, and Shawn of the Dead have in common?  Martin Freeman and Bill Nighy were in all 3 movies.
Raycon are total garbage.
early
WOAH! Was this a face reveal for anyone else too??
FINALLLYYYYYYYY ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Everything Great About Hot Fuzz:  The entire movie.
Yeah, part 1 sounds about right
IT’S LIKE YOU POST THE CORNETTO TRILOGY VIDEOS RIGHT AFTER I FINISH MY HUM essays!
cops does work in britain. It actually where the nick name comes from. it comes from the fact that they used to have copper helmets.
Finally yaaaaaaaaaay thank you!!! And i got the thumbnail right haha
Can we please have everything great about face/off?
Little details from the film:   The Town of Sandford is named after the towns set for the police test when it refers to a town.  When they pull over Martin Blower, it is the shortest car chase in cinema history.   The Swan escaping from the castle was a real case and the police also thought it was a joke  Nick Frost (Danny) when he did the fence scene, wanted to do the stunts himself. To make sure the audience knew it was him, he looked back after crashing through the first fence.  There are probably dozens of others in the first half of the film that other people have missed as well. It's always cool to go back and watch one of Edgar Wright's movies and see what you missed
I could watch this movie over and over! Thank you so much for pointing out so many fun things that I didn't catch!  Looking forward to part deux
Could you pls do Spirit Stallion of the cimarron?
CinemaWins and edgar Wright ? yes please
Finally. It's happening, boys.
Amazing video as always, thanks man
Omg, I’ve been waiting for this, by the power of grey skull. My favourite British action movie
Called it! I love this movie
I love this movie so much 😂 one of my all time favorites
Favourite film of all time, omg i'm so happy you're doing this!!
What a great movie! Can't wait for the second part
and that's a beautiful beard win for you, mr cinemawins.
America's Harry Potter is twilight..... So UK wins that round
I love Hot Fuzz sure, it's probably in my top 20 films of all time. So believe me when I say I would rather watch that adorable Raycon ad with you and Jude for 17 minutes straight than watch Hot Fuzz again. It was far too adorable.
Also the beginning city transmission was also shown well in Every Frame a Painting
This is exactly what I’ve been waiting for.
Wow.  Now I know how denouement is pronounced.  Thanks guy. Also:  Your boy is cute.  I hope y'all have a happy Thanksgiving.
imagine being able to say CinemaWins is my DAD ???? THE EMPITOME OF REASONABLE  WHOLESOMENESS
Also you forgot that Nicholas's badge number is 777 which is considered the Number for God.
I don't know how well known that fact is, but movies often get very weird titles in translation, at least when translated to german.  Like how Thor: The Dark World became Thor: The Dark Kingdom (Guys, it's a planet!),  Taken got turned into 96 hours (wat??),  Thor: Ragnarok was Thor: Tag der Entscheidung (literally: Day of the decision. Way more liberally interpreted it could mean Judgement Day, but it really doesn't).   But Hot Fuzz didn't just get one new title. It got two, and they're both kinda insane: "Hot Fuzz: Verbrechen Verboten" and "Hot Fuzz: Zwei Abgewichste Profis", each meaning "Hot Fuzz: Crime forbidden" (or whichever synonym of illegal you'd like) and "Hot Fuzz: Two Jerked-off Professionals" respectively. I have no clue as to why, especially since the other two parts of the Cornetto trilogy just got to keep their titles without cringy add-ons.
Who else would liek to see and EGA Doom?  It has its flaws, but I love it!  It has remarkably good pacing, an exhilarating soundtrack, a solid cast of actors who give it their all (especially The Rock), impressive SFX, and good action choreography.  Plus, Karl Urban's character's call sign is "Reaper".  How cool is that?  I'll post this in every future EGA comments section until we have critical mass!  This is time #61.
YESSSS
there doesn't need to be an american harry potter to make fun of, the fact you have to wait till 21 is funny enough
Third week requesting Hotel Transylvania.  Awesome Vid.
America's Harry Potter is the Fantastic Beast franchise and we all know how good that is (mic drop (we do it better))... But also thank you and thank you again for covering Hot Fuzz!
Is it just me that has see him irl for the first time in the ad
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It's a good thing britan has free health care
*Yes*
Paddy Considine in Dead Mans Shoes was absolutely amazing and he was on of the bright spots for me in this one
I somehow find myself watching this movie again every year and loving it every time.
Do "Your Name" already! Why do you keep denying yourself a wonderful movie?
Timothy Dalton as Bond was amazing, but I feel like he really came into his own with the more comedic roles in both this and Chuck. Hope to see him in more stuff. Also, great job on the ad.
Simply a great film and a great review
I've been waiting for you to do the whole cornetto trilogy and this is awesoooooome
My favourite cut comes after Leslie's murder to the slamming of the quid in the swear jar and Nicolas shouting "Leslie Tiller was F***ing murdered!" I do love that whole scene
Ah my favourite of the Three Flavours. I still remember the first time I watched this, we had Dominoes Pizza in our living room after renting the DVD from Choices, I was surprised with how freaking brutal it was XD  Though nowadays I think I've gotten so attuned British slurring that I can half understand what 'Filch' is saying. Also Skinner still is one of my favourite villains, he is the perfect Machiavellian
One of my favourite jokes in this movie that took me a while to get, is it's revealed the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance are behind the murders because they are all about looking PC, and obsessed with covering up anything that goes against their "model village" image. Which is ironic because the abbreviation of their name is "NWA".
Could you please do videos on Mad Max fury road and Blade Runner 2049?(Attempt #26)
it's time
America's Harry Potter? Probably like...Percy Jackson?  Also, massive fan of this film and you, thanks for doing it! Can't wait for World's End
Hot Fuzz, aka Chekhov's Gun: the Movie  Also: shame for not having a win for the Peter Jackson cameo Edit: well damn, I said that a little too fast there, didn't i
UK: "why don't they all just drink Butter Beer?" US: Why don't you all just drink.. ermm freedom? Guns? I don't know
I waited so long for this ! Finnaly !!!
This is my favorite film of all time, thank you!! Also don’t forget the “pulling my leg” cut
Edgar Wright should direct KINGSMAN
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO. My favorite movie is a 2 parter. I love this movie so much. So much in it, more then a simple cop movie.
Loved the open to that ad read lol.
Just watched this film last night lol
an ega about hot fuzz? that's some hot stuff!  apologies for the terrible pun, and if you ever recover from it, i'd love to see you make a video about jojo rabbit, and for next halloween, coraline.
A very dense film !
Hot fuzz is an extremely accurate representation of an English market town. I live in one and everything in the film has been done or heard of. Also, everyone is packing.
This is amazing!! Was waiting since the first one, Cornetto trilogie is so underrated!!!
Did we just get a face reveal without a heads up???
So I'm not the only one that thought the Harry Potter in this Movie.
Bad boys bad boys....
Yay! I just watched Hot Fuzz for the umpteenth time a couple of days ago, and just like the rule dictates, noticed yet another delightful detail I’d never noticed before. At the end shooting scene, when the shopkeeper lady peaks her head out the door you can see a revised Romeo and Juliet poster in the left corner. This time, the actors featured on the poster are those “professional” actors they keep yapping about. Edgar took the time to get them dressed up in those costumes for a photo to put on a poster that’s on screen for maybe a second. A gag I haven’t noticed in the film I’ve watched on repeat for more than a decade. This is also precisely why I keep coming back to it! ❤️
can we PLEASE get an everything great about whiplash???
This and Shaun of the Dead are some of my favorite movies! Thank you so much for making videos about them and reminding me why I love them! As is customary in your comments section, I request that you please make an EGA video for the following: - Finish The Cornetto Trilogy with The World's End (2013) - All **4** Indiana Jones movies - Atlantis the Lost Empire (2001) - The Adventures of Tintin (2011) - The Monty Python films - Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985) - Train to Busan (2016) - Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049 - The Cabin in the Woods (2012) - Serenity (2005) - Dr Strangelove (1964) - Close Encounters with the 3rd Kind (1977) - The Shining (1980) - Casablanca (1942) - The Hobbit Trilogy - Children of Men (2006) - In Bruges (2008) - The Fugitive (1993) - Good Will Hunting (1997) - Assorted Akira Kurosawa movies (Seven Samurai, Rashomon, etc.)
What a treat! can't wait to watch!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO IM SO HAPPY
I was waiting for this video! Awesome
Just wish the third in the cornetto trilogy was as good as hot fuzz and Shaun of the dead
Ok, but a friend of mine has a granddad that sounds exactly like the farmer.
I showed my dad these videos. He’s absolutely baffled that you haven’t covered tumbstone! You should maybe..... check it out? I’m trying to get him to like you a little more than Cinema sins
Yes yes and even more yesses
I mean with DrDisrespect in such a big role in the movie, u can't not love it
*Watches five minutes of video* Me: I think it's time I watched more Edgar Wright movies. (I've only seen Scott Pilgrim)
The greater good?     *the greater good*
As much as I love everyone involved it didn’t work too well for me but it’s good to watch someone who appreciates it as much as you
not gonna lie those little dad clips at the end helped me watch the advertisement
CinemaWins face reveal???
YES ANOTHER EDGAR WRIGHT VIDEO!!!!!!!!
I don’t believe it... You missed the part with the hedgehog!
Check out Marauders please. Pretty please
I hope you mention the Shaun of the dead fence jump
Dude! I just realized that's Olivia Colman as DI Thatcher!
Literally made me watch a raycon ad. Man you are amazing at what you do.
12:33 nobody gonna top that 4-wall break ever, EVER, I rofl every time
If you wanna see Stephen Merchant get more utilized, watch JoJo Rabbit!!!   Please do JoJo Rabbit. And Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy. Two incredible movies that being me much comfort, just like this channel!!
My favourite film ever.
I never noticed this before, but the swear box has both the £ and P symbols, which is completely redundant and shows again how daft the police force are. *Again, 45th time rewatching.*
#EGA Interstellar next?
Everything great about Hardcore Henry? Maybe? Please?
While I was watching the ad I was thinking “hey Jude”. And that’s a win, cuz the Beatles are always a win.
In an earlier draft, there was a love interest for Angel that got cut. They gave some of her lines to Danny, sometimes without changing anything.
15:15 beautiful beard win.
I've seen this film 20 times, on itv2.
that raycon ad? that’s a me win
Oh good, your gonna do the trilogy.
Lee, I bought the Cornetto Trilogy BluRay Pack because I had only seen one of them when your Shaun of the Dead video came out. I’m sure I’m not the only one to do this and think it might be a good idea if you had an Amazon Affiliate Link so you can benefit from viewers like me who use your videos as an excuse to finally watch certain movies they just never got around to but want to see the movie before they watch your video. Your videos are always fun and thank you for spreading and reinforcing positivity.
wait i've only just realise you only just done Hot Fuzz today? what?!!
Tell me why I just searched up everything (wrong) with hot fuzz and this was just uploaded.
f i n a l l y, you've made a video for the greater good.
CinemaWins did this film for the Greater Good
MKBHD t-shirt , oooooh
Finally Hot Fuzz get's the attention it deserves
LET’S GOOOO I LOVE THIS MOVIE
9:03 I love how everyone else in the play is wearing traditional Shakespearean clothing, but Martin Blower and Eve Draper are in the costumes from Baz Lurhman’s Romeo+Juliet because they care that little about the play.
Finally
So glad this one turned out to be part one of two! Edgar Wright is a genius when it comes to filmmaking
Can you do everything great about over the hedge
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Man, I do love this movie. I must’ve seen it a dozen times. ... ACAB.
I have been waiting for this.   the best movie of all time imo
so after World's End we will see Everything great about a Fistful of Fingers?
The Crusade Continues!  EGA Johnney English: Reborn attempt 23
Oh hell yes! I don't have any witty comments to add, but I've been looking forward to your video(s) on Hot Fuzz for years! :D
This better be a 3-Part series, w/ a director’s cut and producers’ commentary, or what was even the point.
Huh, now we have a face to match the voice.
Day 6 of asking for Everything GREAT About Dead Man's Chest.
Upgrade. Bunraku. Guns Akimbo. Please please do those three movies.
Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Worlds end ......... the definition of British humour
THAT is a creative sponsor bit, honestly. That's impressive.
I love ray con thanks for making the video 😊
The two desk sergeants are played by Bill Baily who's a famous comedian here in the UK (not sure if he's reached the states). I also like that Sergeant Tony Fisher is played by Kevin Eldon; always seemed an underrated actor and comedian to me, he's always brilliant. That spiderman makeup always gets me.
LOOK at that like ratio!!!!
So that's what you look like. Neat
This is one of my favourite movies ever. The tiny details are amazing
Damn... Your dog is getting grey. And just the other day I rewatched the one where you told us your child was born. Damn... How time passes.
'You can't just make people disappear'
A deserving mention: Somerfield's (the supermarket) was a real British supermarket chain at the time (they went bankrupt a few years later). I feel that companies willing to do product placement like that deserve a shout out. It also added a bit of authenticity to the film for brits at the time, although it dates the movie now.
yeeeeeeeeess!!!!! finally!!!!!!!
Reuploaded?
Beautiful beard win @CinemaWins
Favourite fact about this film. The Point Break/Bad Boys 2 scene was the hardest to film because they needed to ask everyone's permission to use it - including the stunt double that stood in for Patrick Swayze for like 3 seconds
Arent raycons complete garbage?
when a mostly comedy movie has better action then most modern action movies
I am so happy you have covered Hot Fuzz. My favourite film, just beats Fellowship of the ring in watch counts, but I quote it at least twice a day. Honestly made me into the filmmaker I am today.
My favorite comedy! So glad you got to review it. Waittt there's a part 2!? Hecc yeah.
One of my favorite movies ever and there were a few things I missed. Thanks! Oh and awesome vid!
Aw yeah, been waiting for this from the last teaser
In part two I expect police to exclusively be referred as 'the old bill' or 'bobbys'
wait...did the name "cop" come from constable on patrol? That's a cool thing I didn't know.
I’d like to give YOU a win for the best product placement ever...seamlessly blending an ad with a superbly apropos demonstration of well-executed (and adorable) match cuts. DING!
Could you do 'The Italian Job' (1969) at some point pls?
It's not a nose twitch, it's a facial tick, but great video as always!
Yesssssss!!!!!!!!
I mean, it's been like 20 years, and that montage is still an accurate portrayal of travelling in Britain
Jesus, Raycon did not pay you enough for that ad - it was beyond adorable.
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
You could post every day, every week, every moth, or every year, and I will click on your posts as quickly as I can.  Thank you for the wonderful work, and seeing the 'cuts at the end really made me feel like I was watching the review with a friend.  Stay safe, and keep up the incredible work!
I love the joke that when angel and danny start drinking at the pub, the beers they buy progressively get less and less expensive as they move from good beer to awful stuff, as they get more drunk, because who cares how much you pay for beer when you're already drunk.
Based
Honestly cannot wait for the second part. Love your vids and just about shat myself out of excitement when I saw you were doing this movie 😂
Yeeeees, THANK YOU!!!
I mean this in the best way. You're face and voice do not match, and I love it!
Do "Princess Mononoke" you sellout.
Worlds end next
That moment when you're so sure you've seen an episode before and go to look up part 2 and then realise it was only just released *face palm*
FINALLY!!!
1:58 - foreshadowing that there's more than one bad guy
Im just gonna have to chime in on the Raycons.  They are shit. Worse than other bluetooth buds half their price, and compared to other bluetooth buds in their price range, absolute trash. They are just over-bloated bass cannons with no real musical clarity, an 6-hour battery life is below average at this point in 2020 (or even 2019.)  They are TRASH.
I cannot express how happy I was when you made the James Bond reference lol everyone forgets Timothy Dalton
I liked this video before even watching it, because that movie
*Y E S ! ! !*
U know a movie is good when 1 part isnt enough time to praise it
You have a face?
I actually don't think I saw your face before this video, huh,.. Great video by the way, I love this movie and all it's tiny amazing details. 1 thing I love is that skinners car radio is always playing a song related to the murder when he drives by!
I love how he gives out Beautiful Beard Wins but has he seen himself? THAT RIGHT THERE DESERVES A BEAUTIFUL....NO BETTER YET, A GORGEOUS BEARD WIN
YESSSS
I would say Percy Jackson is America’s Harry Potter.
Attack the Block next please!!!
Everything Great About Your Name? sometime? maybe? sometime in my lifetime?
YESSSSS YES YES YES I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO MUCH FOR THIS VIDEO WOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!
My favorite in the Cornetto trilogy. Didn't know what it was the first time (thought it was something like Midsomer murders), so imagine my surprise with the final act. Absolutely blew me away, so many great lines and deliveries.

"We had a love interest in the first draft for Nicholas. A woman named Victoria. She didn't have a lot to do in the story, so we decided to write her out. But we gave most of her lines to Danny." -Edgar Wright

That was the Cutest Raycon sponsor I've ever seen.... I bet you're a great dad :)
It's simple, I see a new upload from CinemaWins, I watch.
That fence scene gets me every time!
Okay dawg, you HAVE to do The Worlds End! It’s my favorite movie, and you have to finish the trilogy!!
Americas Harry Potter is Percy Jackson
I actually wonder that too? What is America's Herry Potter?
Had it been any other movie I would've came back later. But this movie, this movie will get you my attention right now.
YES!!!
You had me at Hot Fuzz but made me jump up from the couch with the "Part One". I need more words to describe how good this movie is anyway!
8:00 Now I want a GOT series with Sandor just saying "Yarp"

"Does Bob look like the kinda guy I'd go out with? It's Dave..." *"Hello there"*
Never ever have I clicked on your vid faster, omg omg omg #hype
FINALLY
100000/10
I put "ev" into youtube on my PS4 after seeing the notification on my phone & this was the 1st thing that came up
Dirty Harry is pretty much American Harry Potter. No Schools, No Magics, Just guns
If america has a Harry Potter I'd have to guess.....Percy Jackson and the Olympians?
Peel Centre/house (Metropolitan Police Training centre) which is featured here at the beginning of the film is also featured in Avengers multiple times as background and main buildings.  The more you know.
4:13 As a fan of the Tau faction from Warhammer 40K, this should have tipped me off.
I could've SWEAR you had EGA'd this already.
2/3 of Three Flavors Cornetto finished can't wait for The World's End keep up the good work my man stay safe my friend
Everything great about Monsters vs Aliens please
"Constables on patrol" is a folk etymology. It's not where the word "cop" came from.
well within the first 100 comments, thats something i guess
I actually went an visited this place by accident over the summer and boiii does it look different
The worlds end?
Can you please do serenity
As an American who loves action movies, Hot Fuzz unlocked the Edgar Wright puzzle for me, and I love all of his films now.
America's harry potter is X-Men
LETS A FUCKING GOOOOOO
good movie
Can you do Godzilla 1998?
Please do 2001: A Space Odyssey
*Happy Yarp*
a better Bad Boys movie than the two first movie directed by Bay.
Now, we wait for the final movie in the cornetto trilogy...
in my opinion, this is the greatest comedy ever made. It's honestly the vertigo of comedies. every time you watch it you find something new
2:24 To be fair, he wasn't wrong.
Day:???? Still No Everything Great About "Ghost Rider"
Ega lilo and stich please

Idk what to comment so ima just comment a pancake recipe: In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, egg and oil. Mix until smooth. ...   Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.
Everything IS right with Hot Fuzz. Change my mind.
Did you miss out even a single frame? “Uhh... Yeah.” Get out.
You have no idea how long I’ve waited for this Thanks mate
The world's end is the best of the trilogy. The issue is if you're American you most likely won't get alot of it
Can u plz do EGA back to the future

Y E S  That's all I have to say
