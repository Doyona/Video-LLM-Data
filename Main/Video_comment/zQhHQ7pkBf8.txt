Wow, I’m so impressed with your talented and precise work.  You, sir, are not only nimble of fingers but also have a gift of conveying helpful information about each watch.  Even though I’ll never be attempting to repair or even open a watch, I’m fascinated.  I’m almost 80 years old and I found your channel and just discovered that my 50 year old son is also a big fan of yours.  I can’t believe he actually texted me the other day and said, “Hey, Mom, have you seen this one?”  Unbelievable!  Thanks from mother and son in PA.
Wonderful job,your very patient and meticulous.
Beautiful watch
It's incredible how I got recommended your channel and wondered if this is something to watch on the side while drawing - spoilers, nope, I just end up actively watching and being enthralled by the precision work you do! Not only is it always most important to retain the sentimental value, but I do also appreciate how you clean things not to the point of being unnaturally shiny and only replace things where ever it really is needed, but don't go the route that is abrasive, which wouldn't just erase history but it'd kind of feel like polishing ancient coins too. That would only take away plenty of value in more than one way. Great job on this one, Marshall!
Bro has incredible skills
I ended up buying this watch for 225k
It’s 4:30 am and no idea why I stumbled on this but I’m on my second video in a row
Left handed mainspring? 17:53
Wow wow wow!
Absolutely amazing. I can watch you do this all day. Thank you for sharing
Great video!
It’s so wild to me seeing all those tiny parts and he will know exactly where they all go. Truly an art form
There's a good chance that the crystal crazed from being irradiated for 60 years.
I’m not gonna lie. I watched a few of these videos today they’re cool as hell I’m not one that would be interested in watchmaking typically but this is still really really freaking cool
That was absolutely fascinating! thank you so much!
Started watching you thanks for the descriptive knoledge
Out of curiosity, did the owner know the value when he brought the watch into you? Very cool of you to give them an education on the watch as well, I’m sure it’ll add to their love of it.
I'd be curious to see the Geiger counter reading of the bezel cleaning water. Does it have to be treated like hazardous waste?
A work of art
Great work.
WOW!
I’m generally not a lover of Rolex watches (MilSub 5513 & 5517 aside). But that is stunning.
you accidentally scratched the automatic winding plate taking it apart :(
Wow,this was really cool. If it were me I'd have like 15 Xtra parts when I attempt to put it back together.
You Sir are the MAN!!!
That's a really crappy restoration and incredibly lazy.
Fascinating👍
That looks like heat damage on the crystal to me. is it some type of plastic or plexi?
There is some excellent penetrant called "Knock'er Loose"  Made by CRC and Available from Amazon for $12      It is the best of anything I have used. (I am 74)    It would have your disassembly a ton easier and less nerve racking!
That crystal has gone like perspex?
Damn man... Nice work! That came out awesome... Id be proud to wear that
Incredible
Now i understand why these are so expensive lol
I wanted to suggest you show a before and after shot once you're done. Also, would love to see a tour of your shop :)
I am surprised the owner let you work on this, as a hobbyist watch repairer. If it was me, it would go to only the industry best vintage specialists. Your final result is fine and you should be proud, but there are definitely areas where you make unprofessional mistakes and scratch the movement and things of this nature.  All is well and good if the owner knew and expected that going in. But i hope you are honest about your skill level when someone with a watch like this approaches you for a service.
what kind of camera do you use? When you're disassembling etc. thanks
I need my Rolex rebuild wondering how much will it be
I called Rolex to find out how much it will cost when my watch needs a service and they quoted me about $1,000 which I thought was a bit pricey. Now I see what’s involved, I don’t mind so much.
¡me enamore del modelo!..
First of all, I'd like to say that I watched your video with great attention and excitement. Servicing and repairing a $100,000 watch requires great care. I'd like to share a few notes from my observations. You cleaned the disassembled parts in a centrifuge and put them all in the same box. Wouldn't this type of cleaning cause the parts to collide and get damaged?I think the pin deflection at the end of the video is caused by centrifuge. As far as I can see at minute 40:13 of the video, you're lubricating with expired oil. If you shot the video before 11/23 and uploaded it to YouTube later, I can't comment.I also noticed that you didn't use a torque meter when tightening the screws. I think there are specific torque values ​​for tightening each screw. At 51:26, after the watch's maintenance was completed and the crystal was installed, a thin white lint or dust particle was also visible under the large white dot at 4 o'clock. These wouldn't be a big deal if it were a normal watch, but when the brand is ROLEX, the situation changes. Regardless, it was a great video. Thanks, and good luck.
When restoring a watch like this, do you use Rolex OEM parts or are there manufacturers that make high-quality replacements? First time watching your channel or anything to do with timepieces and it’s fantastic, it’s easy to tell how passionate you are about this.I hope the recipient was happy with it.
The opening scene of the early posr-war movie, 12 O'Clock High,  has Dean Jagger (Mr Harvey Stovel) purchasing a Bowler hat.  He thanks the store owner for a most enjoyable hour and forty minutes.  I would like to extend my thanks to you for a similar experience. Cheers
yeah, i lost that feather many times during appretencship :-) greetings from switzerland
I admire your craftsmanship and skills. I can not believe that a simple watch can command that sort of price. That is very decent a house deposit for a bascially $100 or so dollars in materials. Rich people problems.
Great job.
Outstanding
wow, how do you remember where all the tiny tiny screws and cogs go?
Great to watch someone do something I couldn't do in a 1000 years.
I have a tritium Secura. Glows like crazy
How much was a Rolex in 1970? The stainless steel Submariner with date that was going for just $230 at the time, only $1,200 today. WoW!   Who is being scammed.
Much respect and admiration for your skills. So enjoyed watching you restore this watch!👏👏👏👍👍👍🇦🇺🇦🇺
Really interesting 😮
I just found your channel this morning, and this is my second video. Your channel is amazing. You have an awesome talent, and this looks like a great hobby. It would intrust me, but I have tremors, and I’m pretty sure parts would be lost quite quickly. But I am a watch collector, and will continue to be a fan of your channel.
I‘ve once sent an vintage Rolex Datejust to the original Rolex service center in Cologne. They replaced the dial and the hands so that the watch has new fluorescent material.
This video was so satisfying and fascinating at the same time to watch  , i am an old school qualified professional Carpenter by trade and i have been restoring Antique plane's  braces and many other very old carpentry tools for well over 40 years now,  i started doing carpentry back in 1965 at the age of five years old in my father's workshop,  i love to watch many other things being restored and this has to be one of the best i have seen,  Thank you so much and greetings from the UK.
I love watching masters of their craft at work.
Awesome work
it wouldnt surprise me if this watch was made by the "radium girls", they would lick the tip of a brush to get very precise lines, but they would paint with radium to make watch dials, they almost all died of radiation poisoning...😥
I stopped "watching" when the guy's shitty play by play voice came on...
Philistine here. Haven't worn or used a watch in 20 years. Thank you for the wonderful video. The work, the video... everything all so well done. Aloha
Now he knows why his grandpa is always sick. Sue Rolex 😂
Need a video on the machining process for those wheels
Hey man what set is that playmat on the left from? It looks almost like Alara. If so, you truly are a man of culture and taste.
2nd time I watched this video from start 2 finish.
Since the beginning of time man been obsessed with keeping track of such! The amount of knowledge & skill required 2 work on these types of watches is right up there with surgery. We're talking a decade of daily work on different watches just 2 be good enough so those who can afford & wear these types of watches will trust you enough 2 allow you 2 even touch their time pieces. I give you much credit as it's obvious from watching you work & narrate; you've got these skills.
Is patina a posh word for dirt? Wouldn't bother me for sweat and body grease to be removed
I’m impressed that you’re just randomly placing the parts on the table. I’m stressed out just by watching for the first 15 mins 😮‍💨
Do you ever forget where a certain part goes or if you forget the order of disassembly/assembly? Whenever I do drum brakes on the car, I always forget the order and there’s only about 10 parts. 🤣
10 cpm  v. 1,000+ cpm 🤣
Nice work! liked and subscribed! Keeping the patina is the best choice.
Sick work! bravo!
Never ever I would be able to put it together again!! 😅😅😮
I never got why Roles watches have such ugly unfinished backs.
daft question but how much does it devalue the watch putting that new crystal on it
I hate your tapered screwdrivers.
how in the world did i watch this 1 hour long restoration video
Great video. I also work with small items/parts (electron microscopy). A good tool to employ for this type of work, is a muffin pan. Drop the parts sequentially in the individual muffin spaces. Then when putting it back together, work your way backwards.  You will never miss a step.
Awesome
The best part is the satisfying click of the little oil pot lids...
I'd no idea there was something much in a Rolex watch 😮.. if I took that apart that's the way it would probably stay 😂
As soon as he showed the glow-in-the-dark features, I thought of the "radium girls".  Crazy!
can you guys hear Seth Rogan talking? 😝
My goodness that one badazz watch.
those old Rolex’s are awesome I saw a 50s era one the other day still in pretty good shape the leather bands a bit beat up but that’s to be expected
Do you guys know the same kind of content but without talking ? Just the sounds of craftmanship ?
Randomly stumbled upon this channel and immediately recognized that voice from countless hours of MTG content I've watched :D Didn't know you were into watches Marshall! Great stuff!
I love the channel  just some ?
Why do I never see to lub the  Palet fork jewels or check the teeth on the escape wheel especially when a watch has cracked jewels or any time a watch  has taken a hit and also taking beat messaging on at lest three positions
Rolex used to be a masterpiece. Now? Just another overpriced accessory in a world that's lost its taste.
Nice video.
fwiw, the belts in vintage computers (mainly on floppy drives) and to a lesser degree, the gaskets on old espresso machines (the heat on espresso machines tends to turn the gaskets hard and brittle) fall victim to the same hardening/goo issues. You may find some new cleaning tricks in those communities. In the world of espresso machines, some have switched to silicone gaskets which are softer, but don't need as much replacing.
When it comes to restoring watches you are genius.  Absolutely brilliant work.
And I was impressed with myself when I rebuilt the carburetor of my 1972 Mercury Comet on my coffee table while in college.  Outstanding video.
Ok so I'm new to this. What do the jewels do?
I like the Mercedes Benz star on the hour pointer.
Absolutely AMAZING !
I love your videos. I known nothing about watchmaking, although I am an enthusiast. So relaxing. Great work!
Great video but that is not a $100,000 Rolex. For that price I could get a Patek Philippe.
First time I ever watched a video from beginning to end of someone fixing a watch. Loved every second
Wow, great video,  Marshall. Thanks for posting.  Fascinating watching an expert at his craft!
Where Seiko Sports 100 got its look from.  why do the gears still look dirty? not shiny but dull and, well dirty.?`
im convinced radium is completely harmless and the only reason the radium girls jaws fell off was because of all the other mystery chemicals in the paint.
My short attention span yet I watched the whole 52 minutes. What does that mean lmao. Well done sir!
Beautiful work.
you were intimidated....currated a tool. The bs level is real.
Bakelite you say?
Pepsi 0:48
Looks like one of Billy Waugh’s
There is nothing better than a vintage Rolex 👑
Hello,  I have a 100+ years old Schaffhausen watch. Would you be interested in restoring it?
because of having to wind the dates minute by minute I would be tempted to just open the watch at move the date dial at the end of February :) (edit: If iI had a $100,000 watch I maybe would have staff to change the date for me 🤔⌚😄)
I owned a GMT-II Pepsi I bought circa 2005. Sadly it was lost/stolen in 2019-2020. Nice work
Excellent!
A true professional ❤🫡
Great stuff
This is internet / You Tube gold. I have a very similar GMT Master that was my father’s and it is a family heirloom for sure.  This video is amazing. I absolutely enjoyed every minute.
This is great, but I'm shocked that people would actually use such things. It's jewelry, not actual timekeeping
It is fascinating to see you watch, disassemble, analyze and reassemble the mechanism of this watch from the prestigious brand. We can’t imagine the time needed to clean, oil, and check each part of this mechanism. What patience it takes!!  Not losing the slightest screw, the slightest rod or the sprocket wheel requires vigilance at all times .. I understand better now the price of a repair of a luxury watch or even a simple overhaul!! Given the time taken for a watch, it is a craftsmanship of a goldsmith.... Only the expertise of a watchmaker can restore such a complex piece. She is asking for advanced training that does not allow for short-sightedness or for a sloppy work!!
Ive had the pleasure of servicing two of this model. One still had the bakelite bezel. I dont like having something that valuable in my shop though.
Getting that X clip to seat on the auto axle is not fun. Its  just begging to fly away
I was praying throughout this video that you don’t accidentally sneeze 🤧 😅
Props for that Magic the Gathering playmatt ;p 30:42   Awsome work.

What was the original purchase price?
Hi!  Firstly I'm not an horologist but guitarist! From a young age I have always had a passion for how things are 'put together' so to speak and upon getting my first electric guitar at 12yrs old it wasn't long before I stripped it down to basically improve it. I have found your video so relaxing, informative and thoroughly enjoyable in watching a craftsman at work. Now I am 59 and have repaired countless guitars that has all come from pure passion for the instrument. So seeing this was an utter joy and I completely understand your passion.... just a fantastic way to spend an hour of my spare time,
I never thought watch repair would be so interesting. I get sucked into your videos and can't stop watching. Pun intended. Keep the vids coming, love these restorations.
Wow. I'm trying to wrap my head around how a watch is worth a 100k.
My blood pressure went up, incredible relief to see it,if I would be rich I would not be wearing it outside you only wear something you could loose.
I'm so glad you chose watches over human brains because you could have been one of the greatest surgeons of all time. I just don't believe in medicine compared to how I believe in time
"Canyon Pinion"? What's the spelling here? I love it when it is removed.
New sub 🖐🏻Bdw brother u sound like matt shadows (avenged sevenfold) my idol🤘🏻
Good morning, I would like to know if you repair watches privately. I live in Stockholm and I have a 1956 IWC that needs a general overhaul. The visible parts, the glass and dial face, need to be replaced.
Bakelite is the ancestor of nowadays plastic, back then bakelite was used for a ton of stuff but it wasn't well known how poorly it aged! Even jewelry was made of bakelite. Nowadays everything bakelite is a rarity and considering how much jewelry is worth I'm really not surprised a watch with a bakelite front is so valuable, regardless of how poorly this material ages! Wow! Can you guys imagine if in 100 years our cheapest plastic jewelry and watches become more valuable than gold? No one could have seen it coming
Do you or does anyone know if he sells watches?
I know this video is from a while ago but it would be so nice for them to turn the broken crown into a ring or other keepsake for another family member who won't get the watch
How much would you charge for that cleaning and repairing?
How often do you have extra parts left over after you reassemble ? Lol
Time master ! Nice work bro.
That was so much fun to watch and the commentary was awesome,Thank You!
My dad had a Theodor Rolex , he died 26 years ago , someone broke into my house and it got stolen.
U must clean and restore it to original.. Then only make sense
Are the tools on your website similar to the tools you use?
18:32 Whoops?
Usually don't watch restoration videos with explanations, just watch the process, you comments wents smooth, I didn't watch - just listening, want to buy kit, but I'm in Russia, so just respect and gratitudes
Very satisfying video to watch and top tier narration
Nice video! You mentioned the Mercedes hand was there to catch luminous materials for drying evenly. Why would they only do that for the hand and not the hour markers if that were the case. Thanks!
GREAT JOB.....
That watch's value is dubious. With that lack of a direct setting of the cullender date, radioactive hands and dial, and that dingy looking bezel. No thanks. I'd replace the bezel, crystal, hands and dial, if they are available. Restoring an old watch, that still looks old after, seems like a exercise in futility.
So someone correct me if I’m wrong but I’m assuming that these watches cost as much as they do cause they have just as many if not more parts then and combustion engine ?
I'm so glad to find this kind of content.
I was getting anxiety watching you take that beauty apart 😂 I really enjoyed this video. My wife and I bought a house sight unseen and told it would need cleaned out. We actually found a lot of jewelry along with an old Rolex watch. It was in an old jewelry box and didn't even have a band. I took it to a local jeweler and at first he told me the watch wasn't a real Rolex but would give me 100$ for it. I declined and took it to a watch shop in the capitol of my state. I was told it was indeed an authentic Rolex and was offered 27K for it in which I accepted.  That money came in good use to me and my wife. I'm so glad that something told me to not let it go and take the time to get it to a professional.
Loved
How on Earth do you remember where all the parts and screws go back? 🤯
Just found your channel… Subscribed! I’m 15 minutes in as I watch you disassemble the mechanism. Very much interested in watchmaking. Wouldn’t be better to put all the wheels, etc. in a small plastic box with a lid so you don’t lose any piece if you cough or sneeze while working?
When did they start making them in China?
That's insane.... amazing.
You have considerable skills but I can’t help but wonder at the skill of the factory workers that manufacture such teeny tiny parts!!! Would love to see a video on that!😊
My dad has an old Rolex with radium numbers. I think it's mid 60s or late 50s. Probably post bakelite era. But because it has radium no one will repair it.
I know nothing about watchmaking.... but I was GLUED to this video! Well done! Super interesting, very soothing to watch. Now I want a Rolex. ;)
Looks better than new.
I love this channel, it is absolutely fascinating.
The same as every other Rolex out there
That was awesome !
Seen this before. The watch i saw was (too) close to a heat source. Glass cracked, and oil spread thin through the movement.
Dude I can't stop watching your videos once started ;) It fascinates me a lot!
If you’re curious to research it, the cracking on the crystal is called crazing. It’s a little different I know the term from airplane windshields
Wow, impressive ... you make that look easy.  Thank you for the video!!
I'm not even into Rolex... your disassembling  of this Watch is out standing!  And what MADMAN/ Woman  made all this part>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Watched every second of this. Absolute Top Tier workmanship. As for the watch…
And i thought working on guitars, amps, and effects pedals was nerve racking. Micro smd boards have nothing on watches lol
Holy! I am a magic player who recently got into watches.. and I definitely was caught off guard by that intro😂 love you marshall
i watched your video on the a168w, and then found this video. im totally a stranger of the watch world, i have a galaxy watch 3 xD, but i really like your videos, sounds like asmr to me, but useful and interesting ^^
Once again Im not a watch guy but you sucked me in. Part of it is i like seeing how things work.  That being said there's a hundred different variations. Cool hobby but i already have a full plate.   Good video btw.
certainly one of the best things I've watched on YouTube!   Thank you for your painstaking craftsmanship with the watch and with the video production and sound.  first rate all the way around!   I think I can sleep well tonight after watching that!
A true craftsman of his trade
This was still made in Swiss?  Unlike the new discovery of them being made in China?
1958 is my birth year. Would love to have a watch from that year. I have a GMT 1 from 1986. Also very nice.
I wonder if the cracking on that glass had anything to do witht radium
I have a 45 year old Rolex Datejust that doesnt run  i bought it when i was 20 . How much do you charge for diagnostic?
What amazes me the how they engineered and made all those small parts.
That is stunning!! Loved this video
That's a beauty 😍
Is there any truth to the statement that Rolex watch second hands glide smoothly without the tick from one second to the next? I have seen in some videos that it is the way to tell a true Rolex from a knock off. Does it depend on the price of the Rolex being purchased? Or is this just a false rumor?
i had a feeling it would be radium for the glowing material. A lot of people back in the day would use it as make up and even as lipstick. Needless to say they had stuff like loosing their jaw, fingers and cancer among other things.
I wish my hands were steady enough for this, I'll stick with engines which my shaky hands can handle and Ferarri barn find, heck, I'd settle for a 71-81 Camaro!
I believe that Watch was in a fire only heat would cause Crystal or Glass to crack like that
wow such a great video. you are truly a very talented guy.well done.
That almost made me cry because it’s so beautiful when I’ve seen it with the new crystal in it !!
This ot' s not ORIGINAL Rolex dial ! Also not original Rolex index color.Must be Tritium and Tritium it' s blue like 460- 470nm not green like 532nm
Do you only work on vintage watches?  I got a watch my lady bought awhile ago that most definitely needs some work done on it and it means a lot to me, it tracks a different time zone as well as a daylight tracker.   Let me know when you get a chance 🙏
Red loctite is permanent, blue is removable.
Reporting every false title this 'dude' has...
This is actually today’s Tudor Black Bay 58 GMT
Surgeons must look at watchmakers and just be humbled…
One of the best videos ive seen, so happy that people are out there restoring these but not over restoring ❤
Hi first of all thanks for your great videos you make it look very simple to work on a wristwatch and I’m amazed how do you remember were all the wheels and screws go into place. I have a vintage wristwatch it was my father’s watch that unfortunately passed away twelve days after I was born so it is the only thing that I have that belonged to my father. My father passed away 56 years ago. The wristwatch is an Atlantic worldmaster 21 Jewel unfortunately it does not work.   I wish I could repair it but I live in a small country and I don’t know any one who has the knowledge or experience to repair old watches.
The watch is a masterpiece. Gorgeous.
I enjoyed every minute ❤
I inherited my great great grandfather’s pocket watch from my Dad when he passed. An Elgin silver watch with a blue faceplate. It was made in 1880. The front crystal plate opens to manually adjust the hands to the proper time. It was found in box in my grandmother’s things in a closet. My father had it fully restored by a local jeweler. It’s pretty dang cool. I keep stored in a safe with a silicone packet to keep moisture away from it. Just to wind it I have to be very careful not to over wind it. It works beautifully and keeps pretty good time. I’ll be leaving it my oldest son when I eventually pass ❤
I had to come to YouTube to see longer videos because the Facebook reels got me hooked
Yah I'm just gonna stick with engines much less complicated
Yes I already do it very hands on hobby electrical engineering
How do I keep my watch from becoming this bad?
How did they make the micro parts? Amazing work Sir.
Stunning, great job, well worth the watch👍👍👍👍
Great skills !! 🔥💥🙌🙏👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👍
Great Job. I wondered why the back dont have any numbers ?
US$100,000.00??
Damn that’s amazing
stunning work, stunning watch, very enjoyable video
Pretty amazing to watch. You had training from Rolex but still requires a skill to even learn.
Wore it till the radiation took him out
You are making me fall in love with watches.  I bought myself a Tudor black bay pro. It's used and a stretch for a blue-collar guy, but hey, I'm worth it.  So many beautiful time machines out there.
You know, actually rolex is cheap... expensive rolex is because it survived in the quartz and digital era😢😅😅😂
When I've seen you work with radium loom before, you've been wearing a resparator etc. how come you were much less cautious this time?
Sensational! Thank you.
Loved the video pure relaxation and high tension all at the same time
You slipped on that one screw.
This is my favorite watch of all time, I would be happy with a newer / less expensive one. For your shop, I recommend “Twist-O-Flex” bands, they have been around for a long time.
why do the service crystals have to have such sharp edges .. I prefer the dome shape
really enjoy your style, setup, personality
🤯
This video now has me looking for surgeon's operating on many different parts especially Hearts.❤
Wow.  What level radioation on this old lume? Can you explain please 😳 ? Why you not use some protected gloves and cloth in this case
A masterpiece of watch repair. But really, what makes Rolex so valuable other than marketing?
It's incredible what human hands can do.
Never got into wearing watches. Just don't 'get' them!
I see you MTG playmat! Nice
In this day and age of throwaway products, this watch is a fine mix of durable engineering and artistry. And you sir is truly a craftsman to restore it to its pristine condition without loosing its soul. You are no hobbyist. In YT today I can only see 2 content creators  who not only is at the top of your hobby but also at content creation. The other creator is Simon Fordman, who makes content out of fixing broken down rust bucket  American cars,  but is also  a videographer par excellence. His artistry at video composition makes a 2 hour video without any voice totally gripping!
I am always amazed by your skills, narration, and humor, which is why I subscribe and am a patreon 😊😊😊.   I cant help but watch concerned knowing how dangerous the dust is from those radioactive dials, and this one has a possibly crumbling bezel too full of it… I hope you were wearing a mask and washed everything multiple times after this. The radium girls story has learned me enough to stay well away from radium watches until I have enough confidence in particle containment, but I already am exposed to more radiation in my day job than most. Cheers to your lovely videos and all the knowledge Ive gained from watching you Marshall!     By the way, my brother’s name is Marshall 👍 Good name brother!
This is just relaxing to watch.
In this order. 1. Screws check them in the links 2. bracelet clasp welds. 3. Font on a double digit date like 28/27 date. All should be perfect. Super clones are so good now weight tungsten and gold plated; cyclops and crystal like gen. So finally is a lupe and case back off to look that close these days; #clean #vsf #btf 😅
Got a sub and like I love this stuff I customize g shock watches and now I'm.hook on all watches repairs and learn how they work
TOTALLY AWESOME!
my parents had a cuckoo clock from germany and the main   spring broke. i was 12 yrs old or so and desided to fix it. i took it all apart and put it back together and it worked only backwards. it took my fatherva few months to notice and fix it right. i think i did pretty good except for the backwards part.
if you forget how  to put it all back together is there a diagram?
I'd just buy a sub-mariner
Wish I had the money to buy this watch. It was made one month after I was born. I love the patina also. It would be my everyday watch as I would only take it off to shower and sleep. Gorgeous restoration!
This is not good news.
Imaging sneezing all of those microscopic parts right off the desk 🤧
Hi, Could you advice what kind of lens are the most convenient for this kind of work? Thank you
Amazing work!
That crystal was crazed with radioactive release!
How do you even begin such a ‘hobby’??? What a marvel of engineering, not only to build such a watch in 1958, but that you understand every single bit and screw, and are able to put it back together. Hats down to you sir! You got a now subscriber.
I could not care less about watches and watch repair but I watched the hell out of this. Fascinating. 😂
impressive indeed
34:58 Magic the gathering Mat ?
Look how intricate this watch is from 1958 !!! It’s incredible
Been searching years for 1  Thought I had 1 but it was clearly a fake  Beautiful watch here
How could I send you one my watches
Nice
OK, now I have a new favourite channel! Amazing work
2:20 wearing that watch will poison you slowly
Isnt that bad, the person wearing this watch is constantly exposed to a radioactive material?
Grandpa wore the shit out of that watch.  Good for him.
Watch restorer and hand model.
20:29 that happened because of the radiation because of the materials, that even happends with uranium glass and furniture
Remarkable
How dangerous is it to wear this watch on a daily basis due to the radium?
I have a 1986 GMT Master.  It was designed for pilots, not travelers.  All aviation uses GMT, now called UTC.  Weather forecasts, flight plans, clearances, etc. are all done in GMT.  With this watch the GMT hand is King - you can change the other hour hand forward and back and the GMT hand doesn't move.  It's very convenient if you fly across time zones.
1958 Pepsi Dial.. wow
watching this man better Netflix
Heat and age will cause that crystal crazing.  Sunlight is the worst.  The owner may have put the watch on the inside of a window at the end of the day, or been an outdoor worker.
Great to see it was loved as well
Great Job!!
very good...but how much do you talk
Really neat to watch, pun intended. Thank you for the resources for my beginner interest in watch care. Looking forward to checking out some more! Be well.
Few people have the enthusiasm you have for watches and your expertise and knowledge is also very impressive

Hello! I'm writing to you from Caracas, Venezuela. I wanted to let you know how interesting and fascinating I find your work. I wonder how you reassemble everything, considering the number of wheels, gears, pinions, and screws that make up the watch. How do you memorize the position of each component? I couldn't do it. I'd have pieces left over! Hahahaha. Greetings and congratulations!
The owner of the watch likely died from bone cancer.
It must be difficult to find the repair parts.
How much is a job like this? A lot goes into it.
How much do you think the original owner paid for that watch in 1958?  How much would that be today adjusting for inflation?  Just curious to know how much the vintage raises the price to $100,000.
Did I just sit here and watch an almost hour long video of someone repairing/cleaning a watch? Yes. Yes I did. ✌🏻
Perfect watch and perfect job! Do you also do repairs on vintage Omegas and less valuable rolex watches (new at the channel). You seem like a true pro and never thought I could sit and watch a whole haul 👌 PS Yes I noticed you do and I love it DS
Wow. I love it!! Where are you located? Would love a service quote
There is a sad story about the women that worked on watches like this. They hand painted the looms and often licked the brushes to get it to a tip. They all ended up with horrendous radiation poisoning and often lost their entire jaw. I wonder what wearing a watch like this on your wrist every day does to you?
wow. i took apart a broken watch as a kid and it had SO many LESS parts than this one does. there was like 5 total. also because i was a child i never put it back together
Those tiny screws and remembering how it goes back together is mind boggles to me.
👍👍👍
Beautiful watch
Such a beautiful watch! And you did a great job reviving it!
thanks for the video.
Please go by the rule, grease on steel against steel, that crownwheel should have had grease.
you sir are an amazing craftsman
This makes me want to start a new hobby. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge.
Beautiful work !
You didn't get to use your mainspring winder! 😩
I’m a very methodical person but I’d be worried to have left over pieces when it’s put back together….wow that’s lots of parts😅
❤
Congratulations, excellent job!!!!
Great job indeed
Bravo, I really like your enthusiasm and love for what you are doing. Thank you
interessting, that they already used violet bearings in the 50s/60s.
Beautiful work!
Ugly watch I must say!
I'd be like a kid in a candy store if I was repairing that!!
👍
This had me more engrossed than any netflix series I've seen since breaking bad.superb!!
So cool to see the process of disassembly to reassembly and the finished piece, what a stunning watch!!
Awesome job with an awesome watch!
Thank you so much! This video is amazing. My father was a watchmaker and I never really knew his craft. I became a jeweller and I just wish he were alive for us to watch this together. Going through some old documents of his I even found he worked for some time in the 50’s at Rolex.
The screen was the most impressive part
100k gmt.. dude lies so much
The simple fact that this gentleman had no need to seperate any of those tiny screws tells of his competence and experience. Well done!
Such a delicate touch 👍
I’m Thrilled to have Stumbled upon your video. You’re very talented, and very informative about the watch. Your work pays the highest attention to detail. I enjoyed watching your Restoration on that Gorgeous Vintage Rolex Watch. ❤❤❤❤❤
My dream watch.  My Dad had one he bought used in Germany when he was in the Army there in the late 1950's.  He passed and we ended up selling it to a Rolex dealer a few years later to help fund my Mother's nursing home stay.  I would have loved to have it but it has paid for several years of nursing care.
I would love to do this as a hobby but my hands are not steady enough lol
Nice to see you rocking a Pink Panther at 25:16. Did you restore that or purchase it as is? Would love to see a video on it.
Thank you for sharing your talent. ✌🏻🤍🤞🏼
Wat cha doin buster?
Impressive discovery and repair😊
You said it!  This IS neurosurgery. HOW do you remember to reassemble the miniscule!  I mean…what?
Mad respect I appreciate my rolex watches even more now.
I am hooked😂
This is how watches, cars, trading cards, etc should be used. ACTUALLY USED and not put away to just be pristine decades later when you die, and never actually enjoyed as intended. Love this video
You're the man congrats.
FAKE, LOL,,found/hah o yeah
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this channel and this project!  Thank you!
Nice ..i think my watch is worth like 10 dollers lol cheera
❤what a wonderful talent you have as a watch maker I as a rolex watch owner  was overwhelmed by your talent jj
Absolutely insane that the bakelite outlived the crystal hahaha never seen this before
Wow never knew that about the classic Mercedes hand. Cool!
Wow 🤩  I would wear that watch and wear the HELL out of it!!! ❤❤❤
I've never watched a watchmaker video before. Captivating!
you should not scratch of the gunk with steel tools like you did, you are damaging the threads and the watch... Use something less hard than steel like copper wire
Put that Geiger counter over some gold
Grandpa died of skin cancer on his wrist?  Do you have to send it to Rolex to have it pressure tested?
شاهدت الفيديو كامل،، سبق و حاولت اصلح ساعات و انا صغير و لكن ما قدرت او بالصح خربتها ،، ساعات عاديه رخيصه و ليست رولكس
Thanks!
Wonderful
Yeah incredible  piece of chit
CÓMO UN RELOJ DE VIEJO Y MALTRATADO Y ROTO , PUEDE ESTAR CASI NUEVO O NUEVO POR DENTRO  ? NO LES PARECE RARO RICK  ? que alguien me explique
You da king. Damn
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
This vid got me to subscribe !! So good!!!
So much bull for a 200.00$ made in China cheap junk. One of the biggest Con jobs ever if not the biggest.
I would sell that immediately
I’m retired electrician in the navy and used to dismantle/disassemble equipments and put them together, oh my it’s incredible how you remember each of those tiny parts, where they go and equally very impressive how you managed to get everything in place and not lose a single tiny part. You’re a watch surgeon, can’t believe you were able to restore that 1958 Rolex, from an almost trashy condition to a $100K vintage watch. My hat off to you! BRAVO!
I believe the stem corrosion is called verdegree.
How do you remember where everything goes to put it back together?
Most beautiful watch I have ever seen ❤
Amazing Refurbishment Well done didn't know there so much work involved amazing.👍
So relaxing to watch...Got my 30 yr old Datejust 16220 just serviced. Chose also a new dial. They removed the old Tritium Lume as well as new hands. It is ready but I can only pick up the watch in 10 days, as the car is also being serviced. Can't wait...so I watch the video.
While I can understand wearing your Rolex every day (I wear my GMT even when Im watching TV on bed), I cannot understand and don't respect people who beat up their Rolex.  My first thought is that they don't appreciate it and don't deserve it.  Just saying.
Your narration is what makes these videos work, imho. There are professionals who struggle everyday to communicate with such easy clarity in the language. and many fail miserably and get published anyway, so low is the standard now. AI won’t help. You’re a natural!
Je n'ose même pas imaginer qu'à la fin il reste en engrenage sur la table
41:34 yes because synthetic rubies and wild rubies are the same material
I totally enjoyed watching that. Wow, and I don't even like wearing watches.
I just discovered your content on tiktok, but unfortunately it was through somebody stealing this video. However, it was such a good restoration video that I had to come to the original source 🫡
i wonder if the crystal "cracking" pattern is due to the radiation decay. 🤔
Simply priceless ✨️🙌🫶
So how much is it worth now?
18:32 only me that notices the scratching :O
Patina here patina there. I think that you never did full restoration like a new watch. Patina here and there is just excuse. Either you don't know how to do it or you don't have the tools and that's why you go with "patina". Even i can do this with "patina"
These are your hands? I would not have guessed that you’d have the hands of a very tiny woman.
It costs around $1200 to service a Rolex watch like this. For that money, you can get a far more accurate timepiece such as a Citizen Eco Drive Chronograph without all this hassle of keeping your Rolex remotely accurate in comparison. That's why if you have an obsession with mechanical watches you should take up the hobby like this.
I think it's crazy how they made these things back in the 50's.
Before: Disgusting  After: Disgusting
que pena no haberlo pulido antes de armarlo, asi quedo feo de nuevo.,
Burst out laughing when you told you needed to oil up the jewels. Guess I'm still a kid after all.
this is a Master Piece of Rolex watch I had similar  model of this Rolex watch but sold out . I really like your all videos, watch your videos is worth it .. lots of love  If I give you 5 stars that would not enough for your all works I am also watch maker but not like you :p haha  I'm just beginner I do fix old watches at home by all my self ..
My great great Grandfather was Dubois. One of the very first precision, Swiss watchmakers. Maybe I should give this a go
Did the owner die of bone cancer ?
Perché perdere tempo per restaurare un falso
It’s an old piece of junk that is only worth $50
Out of curiousity: With engine components in cars, one would resurface the gasket seats, especially stuff like the gasket between the back plate and the casing. is there a reason not to do this? It seems like a flat surface would be preferrable to a worn one for water tightness.
I have lots of Respect todays world professionals who work very honestly on that type Gems nd professional to there clients .doesn’t matter how professional charge but most important Honest Advice 😊nd working on rare pieces of history
I curious that how do they make these very small parts back in century Ago 😊?coz no 3D printer back then 😂
holy jesus ... with all those delicate parts, i would have lost myself trying to put it back together!! ... Very impressive Sir :)
Here's the thing, I have allergies, so I would love to do something like this but also one series of sneezes would bankrupt me restoring something like this haha
I'd leave that crystal just as it is,that's the patina
Did you do puzzles as a kid? This is amazing.
Thank you for the wonderful tutorial..  amazing...
Your videos are very entertaining, thank you so much
Beautiful to see a genuine craftsman at work.
So glad Seth Rogan fixes watches!
I would love to see how these precise parts are made.
Human beings are so incredible. Both the folks who designed and built this watch 70+ years ago and you for being able to restore it.
Don’t you think cleaning it first would’ve been a good step to try to loosen things up and not taking the risk of breaking it because it was stuck down
says he cant afford a watch like this lmao and has 1 million subs lmao. bro that watch is ur one month salary
I cannot believe the SKILL necessary to do what you are doing.  INCREDIBLE!
This is such a great channel
As much as i am a watch fan, i still fail to comprehend how and why the price of the watch to be over $100 000. Like hooow!??? With all emotions aside, its just gears, springs, screws and some special materials. lol
Stunning
I mean it's definitely improved and cleaner but visually it just looks like a new glass
Does the repairer remember where each part goes back? Or is there a “ blown up “ diagram of parts to guide him ?😮
dealing with radioactive material, warning about its dangers. 5 5minute later "it's a great hobby" :)
neurosurgeons can't be any more talented..
I found a watch in 1978. The watch belonged to a woman who was about 85yrs.of age. She was very wealthy and it was her favorite heirloom that belonged to her grandmother. I don't know anything about watches, except for my dependable G-Shock watches. She was literally crying that I had found and returned it  to her. She said " Son do you know what you have in your hand? I said no but I know gold and jewels when I see them. She said, anything you want for this you can have. I said that Ma'am because you were so thankful and to have it returned, and said that I could have anything that I wanted" that was just as rewarding for me. By the way she said that the watch was worth $50,000 and her name was on it as well. Till this day it still brings me joy. P.S. I am just an honest, hardworking carpenter with lots of friends. I talk too much but really enjoyed the process as much as you did? Thanks for letting me comment.
Patience
No chinese parts❤
I'm a old marine and I thought I was pretty tough. But you just turned me in a dork.
why does this guy sound like the guy who commentates over MTG pro tour streams?
Looks old and shitty.
Amazing!
Why is Seth Rogan restoring watches on YouTube?
Just out of curiosity, how much does it cost to restore a $100,000 watch?
Very interesting restoration. As a purist I liked your approach.
Never thought something like this would be interesting but it held my interest through most of this.  Not considering myself a fan of watches but always interested in seeing unique pieces such as these.  This owner must be proud npw to wear his grandfather’s watch.
Do old mechanical drawings exist on these watches? I would love to see this as well.
That is really a treasure.  I’m glad you simply serviced it and cleaned it up.
Bruhhh that's crazy ! Keep it going my g
Beauty example of  “ use the right tools “ Awesome to watch this repair
Ultra rare Rolex, was it made in Switzerland  🇨🇭
Great video!
Terrific project!  Aside from your watch skills, you need to be complemented upon your filming skills of this project.  There is nothing worse than a project of this sort that is poorly lit, focused, etc., but you have mastered the art of lighting and positioning things so well. You must have a serious amount of light to do such filming, as you have the correct amount of depth of field by which to film this all.  I only wish I had the memory to know which part goes on when!  But, I don’t give up easily and will continue to ‘watch’ your channel so that perhaps someday I can aspire to reach such a skill level!  I, too, have always loved the GMT.  As a former navigator with a global aerial navigation job, my use of a GMT Rolex was driven by (the remoteness of my missions), and (2) with the fact that I was tasked with maintaining the time standard for a crew of up to 34 crew members.  The remoteness of our operating area drove the need for a self-winding chronometer Rolex—I could not trust a battery driven watch when the nearest battery shop could have been in Khartoum!  I bought my first Rolex in January 1980.  As a left handed user, the usual watches could not hold up to my roughness!  I’m now on my second GMT, a GMT II, which gives me even more capabilities.
WOW.WISH YOU WERE SOMEWHAT LOCAL.I HAPPEN TO HAVE THAT WATCH WHICH WAS A GIFT TO MY FATHER FROM MY MOTHER WHEN HE WAS PROMOTED TO MAJOR IN THE U.S.ARMY.ALTHOUGH NOT MY DAILY WEARER MAN DOES IT MAKE ME SMILE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS NICE ROLEX.....IF ONLY THEY  KNEW IT WAS A 6542 FROM 1959.
I find it completely bananas that something that small is worth more .. MORE.. than I make a year... 200 days of slogging back and forth to work, cutting grass, shoveling snow, shopping for food, cooking dinners... and this tiny thing is worth more....... nutz...
Trying to get a watch found in my late father drawer and get it restored to sell and help pay funeral bills. How to contact you?
How much insurance would a watch smith have to keep to protect themselves while working on a timepiece such as this?
I know I have seen couple of times when I was a kid if only I knew 😊 u can’t forget that black and red ring
Just amazing !
That was so  interesting to watch
There are people hiring people to assemble IKEA wardrobe - they can't do it themselves even with an instruction - but this!!!! It Is another level of the level of the level. Fantastic job - on surgical level 👍🏻
How the heck do you remember where everything goes when putting it back together?
“Radium lume! It’s to die for.”
You said hands on while you wdre taking the hands off
Wouldn't it be dangerous to wear that watch due to the radium?
I once lost a 1cm black screw on the carpet and it took me over an hour to find it. I better stay away from mechanical watches lol
Great video. I have a 1960 version of this watch based on my serial number. While the watch may have been dropped, as you mentioned, to explain the damage to the acrylic crystal; that damage is severe crazing. Since this was NOT a Safe Queen and evidently worn (awesome pedigree), the acrylic crystal was likely exposed to UV from the sunshine of many days providing the owner with the time of day. :)
Absolutely amazing
I wa not expecting the finger condoms 😂😂
Finally a watchmaker acknowledged the danger of radium compound... (Well, it was a year ago, but i found this vid just now)
Great to see you back alot and wow what a boat!! Very exciting. Just a couple of questions, why don’t you gravity feed fuel? And also, the reels of dyneema stern line, it’s obviously very strong but not very springy, is this good for stern line? I know bigger boats have mistakenly used for towing dinghies which is really bad to do.
How much is this watch worth?
Is that radioactive thing dangerous?
😂😂😂😂😂😂how do you even know what part goes where 🤯 true talent
How do we request this for watches? Is there an email? I have an extremely old Rolex that no one will work on. I need help
Bro this guy worked in Rolex manufacture, no way he know it that much 😮
WHy oh why will someone wants to buy this for 100.000???
How did they produced these smal parts back then with no laser?!?
You sir, are a true gem. 👏🏻👏🏻
Synthetic rubies are actually better than wild ones because they’re flawless rubies. Wild ones have impurities that reduce color and clarity and sometimes cause fractures.
The only thing I know about watches is that I own one. These videos are so chill. You do a great job man
Man, owning a watch with actual radium in it. That's history. Anyone who doesn't know, look up the "Radium Girls" from the 50s. Heartbreaking, but so much history there. Wow.
It has been my experience with Rolex that if anyone but Rolex works on the watch, it is considered a counterfeit
Wow. What a great video. Thank you ❤
How I know when the wstch is worth or good to buy it?
I was toll the when ever the wstch is been working on, the hands need to be st 12. Its true or where need to be? Thank you
You do incredible work BUT am I the only person who is unimpressed by the design of Rolex watches? They’re just plain ugly. I don’t care how rare they are or what they’re worth, they’re nasty! 🤷‍♀️
One of the best videos I've ever seen,  ever. I'm scraping down the back of the sofa to find $100,000 hmmmm What a watch
Compelling viewing thank you.  I've got a 1963 Rolex Perpetual Airking,  think I'll be getting it serviced street watching this. Fabulous watching this
Great interesting video. I could watch this all day. I spent 30 years as an aircraft mechanic but now think i missed my calling. 😅 This is so therapeutic. Thank you for sharing.
I have no idea why this video popped up for me to watch but I'm glad it did. Fascinating. I kept waiting for the sneeze that would scatter the parts around the room....
This guy is a master. Incredible
Would it harm someone to wear a watch with that much radioactiveness?
I have a 1969 Bulova Accutron that I would like to get running again.  It is a keepsake piece.  It was my college graduation gift.  My Father died six months later at age 45, so this is the last gift he gave me.  Thanks!
Masvelous
You ever read something that feels like it was never meant to be in your hands? That’s exactly how The Obscured Principles book felt. Ancient wisdom, modern exposure, and a terrifying amount of truth packed into one single source.
Are you self-taught or can you still get trained (as student or apprentice)?
I've been obsessively watching different videos for luxury watches recently for some reason. So this was refreshing to watch! Something about working with your hands always peaks my curiosity.
Stunning. A pleasure to see this level of skill and knowledge and seeing this rare historic watch
My grandpa left my dad a day date and he handed it down to me. It needs to be repaired and they quoted me at 19k to get it fixed. It would mean the world to get someone to restore it.
BEAUTIFUL job !!!
So before or after they were made in China
Looks like every single other Rolex or Tudor or any of the thousands of brands making the same watch.
Wow what a great experience to get a chance to see the whole procedure🙂
Beautiful work! Did you replace the radio active dial for a save one? I didn’t get that. And you kept the original ring right? $100.000,- ore not but I would prefer not to where that radioactive looming on my watch, it scares me
He said it looks like the owner must’ve worn this watch till it died, I believe the owner wore this watch till he died and then he was buried with it and then somebody dug them up 20 years later and found the watch.. 😂😂😂😂😂
FYI, the radium typically found in watch loom material has primarily alpha decay. Alpha particles (essentially helium nuclei) are stopped easily. You measured radioactivity through the crystal, which was mostly stopping the radiation from the loom (not sure about the bezel). 6 micro-sieverts per hour translates to about 52 milli-sieverts per year, which is slightly above the maximum yearly dose permitted for US radiation workers. It's probably not something you want to wear 24/7, but it's not the end of the world. There's obviously less radiation coming through the metal in the mechanism and out the back of the watch.
I have a Corum bubble watch that I need some desperate repair I'm wondering if you'll do it on YouTube and I will pay for the labor and parts.
Bakelite is one of the earliest synthetic plastics, and it consists primarily of the following components:  Phenol – an organic compound derived from coal tar or petroleum.  Formaldehyde – a reactive gas that acts as a hardening agent.  When these two substances undergo a condensation reaction (usually under heat and pressure, with a catalyst like an acid or base), they form phenol-formaldehyde resin, which is the base material of Bakelite.  Key Properties: Thermosetting: Once hardened, it cannot be remelted.  Heat-resistant and non-conductive: Ideal for electrical insulators, handles for cookware, and early radio and phone casings.  Brittle but durable: It’s hard, dense, and chemically resistant.  So, in essence, Bakelite = phenol + formaldehyde + heat + pressure, resulting in a rigid, moldable plastic that set the stage for the modern plastics industry.
Like finding an ultra rare Garmin. No value. Except for the rare collector, becoming rarer every year. Mostly the ‘value’ is being driven by ‘investors’ that hope to make some money, not caring about their investments at all - as long as their advisors turn some profit.
Not sure if you're aware that nylon strap on the omega is 'help for heroes' UK veterans charity item
Love this and your info as you move along.  Since you know the names of everything else:  the “black pointer stick” looks to be a “spudger” 😊❤
I wish more watches had a see thru back+
If you look at the before & after at 51:10, the date zoom window is a tad bit misaligned.   The line at 6 needs to hit the middle of the zoom arch & the dots on either side need to align with the ends of the zoom arch. Stuff like that would annoy the fuck out of me.
With all that radiation around your wrist..  I guess we know what his grandpa succumbed to.
It is almost unbelievable how many parts are stuffed into a such a small compartment 😮
Who would pay $100K for this junk
Contraceptives are key when working with expensive watches
Don't want to be getting any watches pregnant there
Is there some reason why you don’t clean the watch face? I always see debris on it before you close up the watch.
Amazing watch and unbelievable workmanship.
what red loctite did you use ?????was it 222 loctite???????
Very cool video this is hands-down, my favorite vintage Rolex. A company called Tempus Machina not quite a decade ago was doing their version of this watch. Assuming they were taking new Rolex GMT’s and modifying them to look like the this model. They’re currently not doing it or not in business anymore, but their ask was $35K which at the time was just a little too rich for my blood.   On the crystal you said it was brand “new”. Was this a current GMT crystal or an older crystal. Did it not make sense to try to find an NOS or an old one in really good condition?  I would assume an NOS would be thousands of dollars???   I don’t expect an exact number and maybe you don’t even want to give a range but what does something like this typically cost?
You can be super proud!!!  Fantastic job!!!
Wristwatch Revival and This Old Tony is my life now. I've forgotten what fresh air smells like...
Wait, I know that voice! I know this Marshall! Could it be the same guy from Limited Resources? Is this possible? Wait, there's an MTG playmat!!! What is going on!
Went from being worth maybe 15k to well over 100k.
Radium yay.
I wonder how much he charges per restoration!
I'm pretty sure I have just watched this for the second time that's how much I admire watchmaking and restoration! Good job Sir.. Good job Sir!
I know nothing about watch anatomy but always enjoyed looking at skeleton watches. I find this video really interesting, especially coming from automation/maintenance background. Thanks so much for sharing the knowledge. 👍🏼
very informative and interesting
Give you $5 for it...
I was born in 1958! I just had my birthday ... you missed your chance to send me a nice birthday gift! But I know it's the thought that counts!
I cant spending almost an hour until u get it done... What a talent placing back
It's Tudor GMT with a different logo 😊
Wouldn't pay over $20 for a dumb watch...over rated crap. $100k.. Pfft just a bunch of Metal parts... paying for some stupid name.
Your passion is contageous. Keep up the good work!  :)
Thank you for this video
This was fun to watch! Thank you!🙏
This is just amazing! unbelievable how intricate the fine mechanics on a wach are
Glad I happened to find this video.  Thank you for explaining what each part is called and it's function.
Hey! Marshall don't mix that toothbrush with your personal one or your gums and teeth will be glowing green 😂
The case back looks like a Greek hoplite shield.
It’s like watching the opening of the Ark of the Covenant when the backing is lifted.
man that bezel really needed a polish
I love it! Soooo nice! Bravo on your restoration work. What an amazing piece.
This is the first time I"ve seen one of your watch-related videos (came across it randomly on YouTube), but I couldn't shake the feeling I'd heard the voice before. Took a moment (and the Magic playmat) to make the connection. Awesome to see you are multi-talented!
I will never understand WHY things like this can be so expensive/highly looked for. I understand how it happens but like.. its a watch, it says the same time as a plastic paw patrol kids watch 😅 idk its super cool that ppl can find such joy to find rhings like this, i personality dont get it lol
🗣️🙌🏽💪🏽Good Job Sir‼️💯
You play magic?
As a person interested in nuclear physics, I have cold sweat watching you handle those radium handles. The risk of contamination is so huge with that paint ,as it really becomes dust after so many years...
absolutely amazing!
This is the most fascinating video i have ever seen on yt.
im going to have a talk with my grandpa
Great Video! And   *amzswiss*   are indeed on a different level.
i watched the whole thing
so good
I enjoyed watching😂your video. Sir, this is truly an art which you so expertly performed on this wonderful timepiece. I could tell that the experience was an enjoyment for you to restore the life back into this Rolex. ⌚️😃👍
Been seen your stuff on mtg for a long while but this is very interesting.
uff love the experience, thx for sharing.
I am really enjoying your videos but mate, when you scratched the surface removing a bridge and when you marred one of the holes for a screw during disassembly I winced, also the crystal alignment was off during reassembly.... double wince.  Every time someone looks at the watch they will see that.  Such a shame.  Your newer revivals seem much more together though.
Amazing engineering how many parts and components complications it's really fascinating. I would love to learn from a master thanks for these videos very interesting
well i got a story i have a friend a Vietnam green beret and he likes his Rolex's but he has a story about his first from about his first a Rolex he got in the early 60s a "pilot watch" with the blue and red plastic ring  he lost it in a poker game in nam while drinking he lost it and then went a bout a Sako but it got massive damage in a helicopter crash as he was being ejected from the helicopter he smacked his wrist on it hard enough to break his wrist and spider web the crystal  and broke every fragile part in the thing he keep that one and sent it to a watch repair guy back home who side "what happened to this thing was it in a car crash" he then bought a submariner because he got sent to scuba school  but it got piece of shrapnel on his second tour good to know he lost well over 100k in watches in the span of Vietnam after the second Rolex he wore standard GI issue watches while deployed i told him about this video and he isn't happy $400 pot for a 100k watch(tho i said you would have lost it in the helo crash he said yes but i would have a very broken 100k watch with a story to sell if i wanted to)
Hi I have watched several of your shows and I am hooked lol! So neat to watch and very informative! I really liked the one where you worked on Max's watch! Bravo and keep up the good work! Thank you
Wow! Just wow!
Should keep the original bracelet tho
Does Rolex service 1958 watches?
Beauty!
Maaan your way to do your things is super inspiring!! I want to start that hobby right way! Thank you I really appreciate your time!
I'm surprised by how many screws are in this watch. There were about twenty different screws!
How does a watch like that handle leap year?
I wish I had relaxed as I watched this but at the end, I had tensed up so much. Amazing video. Steady hands. Knowledgeable.
ON THE 6542 WHAT YEAR DID THEY START THE EARS ON SEMI QUICK ADJUST?IVVE GOT A GREAT TIME CAPSULE INHERITED ALMOST 3O YEARS AGO.GR8 COLLAB.GLUED TO IT WAS AWESOME.
Thanks for sharing your craft 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
The scratch you see of the crystal are caused by the intensive radiation of radium,  VERY VERY DANGEROUS WATCH !  its pure beast in your hand or your room. ATTENTION!
Wonderful restoration Marshall. The final result looked stunning. I’m watching all your videos in sequence and I’m thoroughly enjoying your progression through each video.
Awesome work
Saya suka cara anda yang memberi kami penerangan tentang apa yang sedang anda kerjakan (step-by-step) walaupun dengan secara ringkas,rawak  sahaja.TQ ! All the best to you 👍 frm Malaysian with love
No wonder it's so expensive and special watch ⌚
Dayum!!!! Looks amazing
You should get an ultrasonic or piezo dental cleaner used to debride calculus. Essentially a mini pressure washer.
Wow! That was a very impressive restauration! I'm not sure why exactly but I found it interesting enough to watch the whole video from start to finish. Well done!
Always a pleasure to watch your channel
i would not pay 100,000
Fantastic Your skill, knowledge and expertise is amazing.   Bravo.   I will keep in touch
and i.....id--t had one... For me the most beautiful Rolex...
I love that these videos
great owner
Great work and narration.
Well, I have a watch exactly like this one but only made by Seiko. But I paid $500 for it and not $100.000!  It works flawlessly and I do not even have to wind it.  Why would you pay $100.000 .... just it has the word Rolex on it ? This amazes me most.
Thanks so much
Very nice restoration ❤
wheewwww.....so many TINY parts lol
DID THE RADIUM DO THAT TO THE GLASS?
dont put a price of 100.000,00 price on a watch people are finding out were made in china
1st time on your channel, wonderful work. New subscriber ✌🏻
ngl, u could ve cleaned waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better, shit continues dirt af
The bracelet looks good
Date window is to low
what a likeable guy
There are some questions about the "dial replacement" because the font was different.  Earlier in the video you had said that is looked like it had been worn until it stopped working and placed in a drawer.  Yet, the dial "may" have been replaced?  Would not that have been done very early (maybe at time of purchase) since it is still a radium dial?  That would still place the watch changes very early in its life and maybe even an option that was offered to the buyer?  I guess something could have led to a dial face change but since the carcass was so hard to open I would think it more likely this was done at purchase or as an option.
Rolex service would remove the dangerous  radium paint...
Throughout the whole video, I was just thinking of the precise engineering that went into producing these micro parts. How did they make those tiny wheels with even tinier geer teeth? 😯
Case still has a scratches, hands still old radium, crown replaced,crystal changed . Value of the watch went down. I don’t believe ppl in comments still praise ur work. That’s not restoration it’s a disaster. Take a break.
what tool do you use to apply the oil & grease? I need one of those, it is so precise.
Really fine!
8:23  OUCH ! !
32:58 Excuse me? 😅
Watch making is such an expensive hobby... Annual salary below 150k, need not apply
100 k for a radioactiv watch 😮?
for next time, it would be a good idea to put like a pad underneath the dial inside the bezel removal tool for when it drops out
Hey...I want to see the finished work! My bad i thought the video was over about half way through. Lol
I find it amazing how people react over a watch. It just tells you the time it’s only expensive because society makes it expensive. We make it expensive. Most people will never know what’s hanging off your wrist.
Awesome Video Sir! Planning to get my first automatic budget watch is SeikoMods any good? I know its nothing compared to Rolexes 😂@WristwatchRevival
bro, you didn't clean the face of the watch; it looks like miniature dogs pissed on each part...and it just dried up...talk about shocking...
Did anyone ever tell you that you sound like Craig, Louis’s boss, from Malcom in the middle?
you bent the hand bro but good job
When a watch shows the date how does it know what is gonna be 28,30,31st, or do you need to adjust for different month endings??
Why am i watching this?
The cracking comes from the radiation being admitted by luminescence. It is trapped in there, and the gas in the heat of the day reacts faster thus decades the crystal because it is pours
The red being halfway on the 6 but not on the 8 irritates me SOOOOOO BAD.
Bakelite was the first material used on M16 rifles.
How much would the original 1954/5 Rolex GMT  Pan-AM be worth then?.
why the hell did i enjoy watching this so much?
Excellent Video 👍🏽
Awesome job!
Sorry overpriced well marketed junk. Rolex’s are for suckers. Nothing special no precious metals (or enough) to even matter. Only thing special is your low self esteem and how you felt when you overpaid for it 😂.
Does it count steps?
WOW what are you wearing on your wrist for this excellent video, love it !!!!!
Wow
Great video
I like this channel because I like watches, and the videos are soothing. Recently I even started just listening to Marshall's videos during my commutes without watching the videos lol. His voice is just very relaxing.
Best job for people with ADHD and anxiety... :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
Beautiful!
Why didn't you brush it to give it a better clean ? It does kind of look dirty.
This is impressive
Do you remember when you made that video talking crap about people touching the inside watches and you gotta wear gloves or finger things and then here you are we’re only three on each hand yet still rubbing your fingers all over the inside of this watch dude come on man
WOULD TAKE ANY 5$ CHINESE WATCHS OVER THIS! ANY!
How the hell do you put it back
do you ever upload videos without the commentary? i like to know what’s going on but sometimes just watching with the asmr of the handy work is so satisfying and calming
Great Work Well Done
it was probably made in china too
I mean who first sat there designing a watch in their head with all those moving parts?
Wow unbelievable skill
good look on putting everything back
is it dangerous to wear? it is an amazing watch
wow i didnt know i could sit through 1 hr of youtube video
👍
AMAZING——>>> SUPER TALENTED ——> IAM SPEECHLESS 👍👍👍💕👍👍👍
Just dont wear it all year
All Rolex watches made till 1970 were made in Swiss, after 1970, more and more parts were made in PRC. The fact
Thank you for these videos. I could never do such meticulous work but it is beautiful and relaxing to watch. It calms my ptsd to sit and view this type of art.  What you do is art. Again, thank you.
Is it just me or did anyone else find it frustrating that he did not turn the bessel to show us not stuck anymore
Brilliant job.. absolutely perfect. I think someone sending it to you, a non-Rolex company repair agent was probably already asking for it, but sending it to an amateur (albeit excellent) repairer to boot seems like the biggest up-yours to their customer care policy imaginable 😂 😂 😂  Well done! Beautiful job.
I really would like you to rebuild my grandfather's watch
Speedmaster on a Nato strap should be a warcrime 😂 Love your videos! Ive been wanting to start watch repair as a hobby, having needed a few serviced now and always having wanted to do it myself out of pure ego.  What would you recommend as a first time watch repairer (except your tool kits)
I really like watching your channel. I find watch repair to be very interesting. I do have a question. I own a Seiko watch given to me many years ago. I quit wearing it for unknown reasons to me at this point. I am 67 and starting to think I'd like to get it going again. Is it all worth getting it up and running again?
Yeah...wow...nice work Man... truly.
Nice video not sure if I could remember how where to install the part after cleaning,it take a true mechanic of watches to do this
Wow lots of detail respect your talent
How does the watch know if there's 30 or 31 days in the month
this just amazes me!! imagine all the old watches sitting in drawers through out the world that folks think are not worth anything!!!
I'm just fascinated with all your tools as well!!! Those tools are not cheap but very important for that job it does. For example.... there's no way to get that back off without that awesome tool! No way. Well done sir!!
love these videos!! I wish I could have the time to do all this!! one day!!
I’m such a low rent piece of trash, I would just take the watch and run. Delete the YouTube channel, and live in a hotel on easy street.
Incredible knowledge and expertise to do this!  Well done!
Un autre monde  !! magnifique  !!....
The number of ads during this video is just mind-blowing, it makes me want to stop this video even if it is good quality.
Utterly fascinating
51:09 Totally gorgeous. 👍🏻
The economics of these “high end’ watches is absolutely bonkers
Precise meticulous brilliance!
Still an ugly watch. 😂😂
Beautiful dedication and love. Onya
I hate that he didn’t clean the bezel maybe not sparkling shiny clean but a little better cleaning 🥹
You mentioned this was a simple complication and I find it absolutely insane. Wow what amazing work
Selling for between 70k-195k😱 This restoration took courage 👏
So so enjoyable. So well explained... I never thought I would be fascinated by a watch being serviced, but there you are.  Thanks again..
Wish we could of gotten reaction of the owner
Wow... bomb squad quality man. Very sharp absolutely perfect 😃
it's a shame you don't restore the cases, more of a clean and lube vs a true restoration, you don't have equipment / tools and skills for complete restorations?
Sounded like LBj old white house tapes! Gnarly !
How much did it cost them to have you do this?
Quite fascinating
Beautiful!
The slight tug after 3:50 to check pressure was perfect. Then you get that first pop as the tool tightens and the bezel releases from it morring and check to see if the unit is still one piece...brilliant
How much does it cost to restore ?
Enjoyed this episode from start to finish.
Gorgeous
I owned one but the Bakelite bezel was replaced - sold it to a collector. 👍
💯 For some strange reason this was very satisfying
@Sreetips
If it were mine, it would be yours..  Beautiful watch Beautiful work Thanks
I stumbled on this video.  Never seen one.  I know Marshall’s voice very well though.  And I noticed the MTG play mat.  I love it.  I found a new channel to watch…get it
Bob Ross of watches!
And now that it has been r estored with non original parts it lost 60 percent of its value. Congratulations geniuses.
I own a 1976 GMT Master myself.  It has a plastic crystal just like that one
Wow! This is so cool! What a beautiful transformation. Showing the Geiger counter was a cool touch. My grandfather was a watchmaker, but I never got to see his craft, unfortunately. This is so fascinating!
Wow, what a cool video! Fascinating to see how that mechanism works. One thing I noticed, and I wonder how you dealt with it. When you first put the second-timezone hand on, it was resting against the luminous marker at the 12 o'clock position. It can't be desirable for that to rub when it goes by, so I assume that you adjust them for clearance. How is that done? Is there  some amount of play where the hand can be tilted slightly on the axle to level it, or do you have to bend the hand itself slightly? Such delicate work, my compliments.
Awesome!
this guy is charging $850 for some plastic tools, screwdrivers, and a rubber ball lmao yea no fking way dude
What a tremendous save…
Amazing job you've done there real credit to you
I have a IWC pilot chronograph that I purchased and it turned out to be fake but it has a 7750 movement that stopped working. When I sent it to my watchmaker he said he wouldn't touch it. If u want to take on the job I'll pay whatever I just want it to work because my wife bought it for me after I had surgery and even though it is a fake. Well it is my favorite watch because of the memories.
This equipment can be quite expensive!
Watchmaking is not a Hobby,It is a profession! you are not MAKING this Watch,you might be REPAIRING it! That shouldn't  be a 'Hobby " either! Are you Rolex certified!  Now,Back to watching the Video! Wow!
Superb restoration ❤
Beautiful work sir
😮❕
Marshal you are amazing; your work floles, and the story teling, and the hapiness at the end it showes passion for the work. It is such a plesure watching you working.
Amazing work! super excited to watch! no pun lol
NOONE Going to comment at around 15:35 when he says " the disaster" with these.... And the winding spring flys into the crevice behind his tweezer?? I'm not watchmaker and LOVE these vids but that IMMEDIATELY made my heart sink
I'm scared of the radiation 😂
ALUMINIUM..😊
I've never seen a watch taken apart  before. I am amazed at how many parts there are. I'm a restorer in bikes & car's and can see you are a master at your job because of the random way you put the parts in any order.
Ordering one off Temu now.
Great video sir
What do the jewels do?
there´s a chinese or japan guy who does thes same...he doesn´t talk so much, he doesn´t talk at all ... much better, a lot better
First time hearing about old watches being radioactive holy smokes lol
16:19 and he has to put it back together.... wow.
I just watched this great restoration, a second time. Thank you for completing it and in such a precise manner. My uncle wore an Explorer for more than 50 years, well worn but serviced regularly, my cousin a late 60s GMT for more than 40 years and my 1969 Submariner accompanied me for 46 years and sold to a collector. They are very sturdy watches and mine -not a superlative chronometer- kept time better than ever envisioned. Please keep sharing your accomplishments, we love the videos and commentary.
do you have to talk so much
Very, very intriguing.  One question I have having watched the video is whether or not touching the movement with a finger exposes it to moisture and damage from the direct contact with the skin.  I've always been told that you should never touch a watch movement with bare skin, but I noticed you did several times during the reassembly.  Is it o.k. to touch a pocket or wrist watch movement with your fingers?
I'm a mechanic by trade so I'm used to lots of nuts and bolts, as well as parts. But I am amazed how how you know how to reassemble this without marking things. I'm sure it took years of practice to master. Much respect sir. I am amazed.
Jases, I'd be trembling, to say the least, with up to $200.000 under my fingers like that ...
I never stop being amazed about the marvelous engineering of these old watches. A job well done  I own a Seiko from February 1971. Seiko made some super solid movements that still keep ticking after all this time, even without any service. The 61 and 56 series were total workhorses—I’ve got a few myself. Gonna do a bit of digging now and see what she might be worth."
Iv gotten hooked on your content was even watching it with my dad and my uncle ..they are old timers and owned a lot of watches over the years .. Rolex elgin timex and who knows what they had  65 70 years ago ..I still do a lil work to the watches they own currently ...over all very impressive and I may get into mechanical watches  soon .. again cool content
Montre magnifique
Was delivering to a house last month and the guy was watching your channel! We haha chat about how relaxing, fascinating and satisfying it is to watch someone fixing a watch. Thank you
!!STUNNER!!
Worked for a nuclear decontamination company in college. Visited an old project previously done by them where they had to remediate the sewers in Waltham MA. Old watch factories would send the small amounts of radium down the drains when they were prominent in the 1940's through early 60's. Fascinating project. Even had to remove all the old plumbing in the building since it was radioactive.
How much do you charge for a clean and service like that?
How much did you charge for this kind of service if you don’t mind me asking?
I wouldn't give you 20 dollars for it.
Brilliant!! Akin to brain surgery.
Wow, simply a pleasure to watch. thank you.
I get overwhelmed by too much talk.
wear until it stopped. That means the rolex movement is no good. I suspect, it runs for only 15-20 years and then stopped working for no reason. I have friend having their rolex wear for 30 years often, never service and still working well. Rolex is famous becos their watch is very robust and works well even under harsh condition. This watch couldnt tell a story.
After that first screw removable i would be lost.
1068CPM. Not great, not terrible.
Id run myself insane  trying to restore a Rolex like that ..and probably would be for the money it would bring .. course id buy another old one to keep the hobby going.😅
Where are you from ?
And I thought changing a timing belt in a Honda or Toyota had lots of parts to take out.
I let the camera run as I was looking for  a crown-wheel  screw  in my shag carpet
Großartige Arbeit!
An absolute privilege! Superb commentary sir! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Fantastic 👏👏👏👏
Mission impossible keeping the Bakelite bezel in one piece achieved. The one thing better than a Rolex is a vintage Rolex. Long after my life ends, my well-worn, well-serviced 1986 Date will become vintage as well.
Went to see a watch video and found a Magic personality. Nice.
Were do the radiation go? 🤷‍♂️
Why they call it watch making  when actually its watch repair or restoration ?  Isn't watch making when you actually build a watch from scratch?
it is including  radium ? radioactive  elements
Well done 🫡
Puts a new meaning to the term "death watch"
The radiation from the watch 😂
So how does the restoration affect the value ? Especially with Bakerlight.
beautiful
I hit subscribe because of the MTG play mat..
I think you should’ve put the original Crystal back on it. After cleaning it first.
Rolex was originally an English watch maker, but no one says that, if it was Irish Scottish or Welsh you would never hear the last of it 😂
Awesome! Future generations will think Aliens did this fantastic mechanism!
Smoked Blunt taking shit atm rolling another blunt still watching the vid shi is golden
that rolex is today under 10 000$ ;cos  nobody care's about mechanical watches anymore
Impressive and educating ❤
This was absolutely awesome to watch and it really shows just how incredible the human mind is.
come take a look at Albert Einstein take apart a watch.... incredible I wear a jubilee datejust everyday I love my watch
Beautiful watch and nice work
Just incredible. That was an excellent restoration and I love your video. You earned a new subscriber my friend.
Your commentary is just as enjoyable as the work you do on these vintage pieces! Thank you!
that things beautiful
A $100k 1958 Rolex..just imagine what it will be worth in 2092 another 67yrs from now? $$$$$$$
Absolutely master class wonderful to see and hear your joy working on this masterpiece well done
Could swear I saw one like that on ebay for like 3k...
Your not a drinker 🫣
Beautiful work
Sir, you are a credit to your skill👍
Could you repair a 1950 tudor
How do I go about contacting you about my waltham bathyscaphe services? Thank you.
Wow, I’m honored to have observed that.
Two words… first class.
I thought what set a genuine Rolex apart from the fakes what the 'seconds' hand movement... it was a constant movement and not the standard 'ticking' movement.
Can you invite Michael J. Fox on as a guest watchmaker?  You could instruct him on what to do and he would do it.  I think that would be interesting.
Every so often, this watch fixer sounds a lot like Tony Robbins.  If you know Tony's voice, see if you can tell what I mean.
I think the crystal is from heat maybe the watch was in a hot location like a storage locker in Nevada or something
Recently found your channel. Brilliant to watch nd a new happy place when I need some calm time. Thank you for the videos. Uk viewer.
Proof that Google soy on us: I have never been interested in this for my self, but I do have a watch that use to belong to my grandfather, not nearly as fancy as this one tho, is a RADO Silver Sabre, from the 60's, and the cristal is even more damaged than this one and also doesn't work. Looking for where should I take it for restoration, I find that the RADO service from Mexico is 2 blocks from my work place, unfortunately they don't restore it. But just from that quick Google search and the visit to that place, YouTube decided I should watch this 🤣
Did grandpa spend time in Chernobyl?
Personally, I prefer a restoration that makes the item, whatever it may be, look brand new.
👍🏻🍀✝️🇺🇲👊🏻
@9:00 im surprised you didnt notice it was actually running
34:11 Diddy also has an oiler
3:40 But this one is more expensive than some Ferraris
it was the new o ring not lettin the crown screw on wrong millimeter thickness u could see it was to fat
What a crappy watch company. It cant even keep time correctly. What a POS
That's crazy! Not my thing at all but I couldn't stop watching simply because of his knowledge and craftsmanship.  I definitely couldn't do this, especially on something that valuable.  Question, if anyone could answer; what are watch jewels for anyways, what exactly do they do, and why jewels?
How the actual F does Marshy know which parts go where when reassembling?! Just pure experience? Does he keep a log? Is there a method to his madness of placing parts when he’s dissembling that I don’t understand? I need answers… 😮
Acest ceas face toți bani
Super restaurare 👍👍👍bravo domnule
How do you remember where all parts go back to?
Best reality show I've watched in years
Never mind how nerve-wracking working on parts so small must be. How in the lords name do you remember where all of those pieces go?
Such dexterity!
Tie me
I'm guessing that watch sold for around $200 in 1958.  Still a lot at that time.  It's fascinating that it was designed for Pan-Am Pilots.  A lot of interesting information.  Thanks!
Watching your channel in series. I’m noticing a diffident improvement in your skills, ie… the oiling/lubricating of the watches.  Keep on keeping on…  Mark
Just to add some additional information regarding radium exposure - this was in 1926-1927 (respectively) and really doesn’t pertain to the watch.    —•> In the early 20th century, "Radium Girls," female factory workers, suffered from radium poisoning because they were instructed to "lip-point" their brushes (licking the tips to make them fine) when painting luminous watch dials, leading to ingestion of the radioactive paint.
Wow, that was amazing skill to be able to do that kind of job very professional. I cannot help but wonder what would something like that cost to service a watch like that one thank you for your video. I enjoyed it.
That video kept me interested the whole time.  Thanks But as far as doing it myself???.. I'D end up throwing shit across the room.  I work on cars.....That reminds me... My 72 MonteCarlo has a clock that I cant get working.... any advice?
I had no idea these still had Radium. That's fairly modern for such a well-known danger
I enjoyed every minute of this video. Amazing job sir 🙏🏽💪🏽
Nice Video … I am a 🚌 driver and pass many times by the Rolex factory in Biel 🇨🇭😀😘 There is a special „Rolex Course“ that brings workers from the train station to the factory, about 04:15 !
How do you keep track of what goes where?!😅
It's almost like heat fractures.   The crystal.
what a unit
I'm obsessed with this channel after 4 videos.
Ive been fortunate to have owned 3 different Rolex at various times in my life - a GMT Master in the 1980's, a gold Presidental in 1990's and still have a Submariner from the 2000's.  Used these dive watches in the ocean.  Amazing workmanship
How much did the client paid for this kind of restoration
This reminds me of that time my college roommate decided to tear apart the engine of his Nissan Sentra and we had car parts and a cherry picker in our apartment living room. "Now, you are going to remember how to put that thing back together again, right"? 😂
it bothered me a lot that you put the pin on top of the watch and applied grease there, why?
Bro, you're narrating this video after you completed the repair. Why do you act surprised? You already know!
would Rolex have repaired this watch or is it too old for the company? I heard that Rolex does not provide maintenance services for watches beyond a certain age.
riveting!
I dont know why this gives me so much anxiety...
When you brought up the website and the person you partnered with, I immediately thought of Chris Hansen in how to catch a predator 😂  Or at least I think that’s who made the show
Those things are not that special they’re just overpriced!!!
Great job. Very fine detail. I have a Citizen and took it back to the jeweler I bought it from after a couple of years and asked him if I needed to change to battery for a newer one. He said  there's no battery/ I asked why not. He told me that my watch runs on solar. I was flabbergasted to say the least. Thanks for the education. .
The cracking pattern looks like it could be from the radiation.  We see it on our Plexiglass containers for iodine and y-90 treatments.
The end mill marks on the inner workings are absolutely beautiful. And to think all human skills no computer involved.
im not a watch lover as i thinks its like the horse and cart, we're using cars now. i do enjoy watching  the restoration
Dude says I can’t afford. I watch like this has 7 million views you to pay them enough for this vehicle just to buy a Rolex watch ain’t that a shame
Putting it back together again, HOW! Your amazing!
It's incredible to see your passion for repairing these vintage timepieces! 🙏
So relaxing watching your videos
This is awesome. Just popped up on my algorithm
Minute 2:41 no wonder grandpa died 😂
I think I have a guy coming on Saturday to look at the sailboat. I really hope it sells. It would make things less stressful right now
I love this channel, are the parts "die cast"?  cause that would make sense.  If you meld metal into a tiny thing, it would be way more accurate. That is all this is about anyways right? Accuracy. If every part was a thing in the part of a "die cast" thing, then it would make sense about the price.
its "DIE CAST" vs "pressed"
Tell the people, that if it isn't "die cast" than its crap
If it isn't "die cast" than it is garbage.
You don't talk about the fact that about of "pressed" vs " die cast" parts
So, I would assume that only "Rolex" could afford too make parts "die cast".  But you don't talk about the obvious manufacturing stuff.
Pressed parts are garbage, right?
is this thing "die cast"? and if every little thing is "die cast" than that makes sense
I think your channel is really great.  You really need to tell everyone why the parts are really cool.  Pressed VS "Die Cast".  You don't talk about that at all. You really should.
What the half life of Radium?
Oh sheit the last part that not working is scary me
Accidentally stumbled upon this video. Never thought I'd be watching a watch being repaired. The complexity, the craftsmanship,,,, to my surprise, this was so satisfying and fascinating.
Beautiful
43:29 Mercedez? Isn't this that hippie symbol? LoL
Idiots buying expensive watches will always be funny
Ah man, there’s 1 screw left. Take it all apart
Damn bro, if that’s a hobby, what do you do for real?
32:26 magic
It's very interesting
For me it's completely a miracle, that somebody is able to disamble AND assamble this kind of watches. Unbelievable for me. What a very nice profession! Thank you very much for this video!
As a noob, I appreciate all the explanations about parts and stuff!
I would love to begin fixing, and maybe even making my own, watches, and clocks. What is the first few books, and/or videos that I should get, to start me off? That’s a beautiful Rolex. Thanks for sharing with us.   Thank you for the tutorials that you do. They are fascinating. 😊
Thank you 🙏🏼
That’s supposed to be a gilt radium dial… but it seems a later tritium replacement… something weird ..
What was the piece you said could not be disassembled? If a piece is assembled shouldn’t you be able to disassemble? Or are we talking alien technology 😊
Por qué no deja el reloj pulido que otros relojeros lo dejan como nuevo ese arreglo se ve feo y viejo
$195.000. Bruh 😢😢😢 i could buy a villa with that much money ngl
That did out to be a beauty
Great precision. Excellent work!
Fun fact the luminous part of the bezel is made of radioactive strontium -90 ..any damage to the bezel will release alpha radiation at sufficient levels to be very dangerous to your health
I'm a machinist and id absolutely love to know how to get into this line of work... I've always loved working with tiny parts
thanks...
The reason the crystal cracked is that they had a perfect case seal ann over time, the radon gas built up and expanded the crystal from inside.  Over time, push comes to shove, and the weakest part gives way.  All things must give way to time!
Man, that was impressive and satisfying… What a piece of art… Thanx for sharing this vid…you made my day, Sir
....the bigest Compliment for YOU !! Kinde regards out of the Country the Watch coms  .... SWITZERLAND 😊
I enjoy watching the videos and am only working on Timex watches now; mostly Zippo lighter fluid and oiling.  Every time I take stuff apart it does not keep time when I put it back together.  At an estate sale I got a Swiss movement watch (GALLET & Co), it looks like the ones you work on with jewel bearings.  I was polishing the crystal and noticed it was hinged and the crown has a push button to open the crystal to the watch face and hour hands.  I doused the inner workings with Zippo lighter fluid and it started to work but when the lighter fluid evaporated it stopped running.  Do you have a video that shows how to take apart and put together a watch that allows the face to be opened?
This is the most pure definition of over-engineered. 😂
I love Watches 😭
I have a zenith El primero chronograph that I found in the ocean the crystal is crack 😞 definitely water intrusion salt water at that... But I realize this piece is extremely rare. I believe it was actually pre the public release and likely belonged to someone in NASA, Harris, or Lockheed martin from the original reale 8 group who found and salvaged the 1715 fleet off the coast of fl. With kip Wagner. After hearing you water intrusion is very bad I have lost hope in it ever being repaired 😢
Wow absolutely amazing.. i really enjoyed watching this whole process... you got a new sub in me sir 😊 thank you can't wait to see what's  next
Great video, i was really interested in watching the whole video, imagine the engineering and machining that went into creating this watch, it just blows my mind. This is so awesome. You just gained a Subscriber. Thank you for your work and dedication.
I'm surprised at hearing that the Bakelite Bakelite is such a difficult material to deal with. When I was a Rollforming fabricator, Bakelite found its way into a lot of the dies and shaping blocks, due to its ease of machining, strength and flexibility. It must be a very thin layer.
OMG 👏👏👏👏
cool video, but the watch looks like garbage.  Patina is cope, saying wow they wore this a lot - New looks better to me.  Whoever would spend a lot on this watch is off their shit.  But then again, no one actually buys this - its just the grey market dealers trading it back and forth to each other.
Rusted, gouged, beat up. $100K. Absurd.
Scrumptious watch! ❤❤
Beautiful
it's very dangerous for your health with that radiation, and it's just on your wrist for hours, a huh
Such an awesome awesome watch. Great job. I bet the owners family are really appreciative of your work.
This man working on something that could pay off all of the debt I carry without shaking hands 😂 a true master
You were way too cautious with the bezel. It just needed a proper solvent cleaning—nothing you had would have been too harsh, especially after 50 years of heavy wear. I get that the watch is worth $100K, but there’s a difference between being careful and treating a routine service like a high-stakes restoration. It was frustrating to watch you act like it was on the verge of crumbling. Here I am after watching it at 1.5x annoyed...
I have a Esq flight watch my wife bought me in 08. I sent it out for a battery and immediately lost the winding pin after it would never stay in.is it fixable?
the owner clearly see these videos and was like yep thats my guy lol
Didn’t watch the video so I may be speaking in vain; but if the replacement parts aren’t genuine Rolex parts then imo it’d be better left original
That is one beautiful GMT Master. Amazing job and thank you for sharing. Say what you want about Rolex and sometimes the stigma that goes with owning one or attempting to purchase a new one but their movements are amazingly durable. I’m keeping mine and wearing it proudly 😁
I  know it's not watch related, but I'm interested in the cool lamp that is next to your cleaning machine..
Have you ever put a watch back together and have leftover parts?
It s a pity that the dial does not belong to that watch,but to a more recent model..
How i ended up here, i dont know but im not complaining! Amazing work and fascinating to watch
My all time grail watch
I have the same watch that was my fathers, he only wore his a handful of times so it’s practically brand new. Let me just say, I love the one in this video! I love the worn but serviced look. Marshall, another masterpiece!
$20-30000 my friend why say $100000?
Damn. I viewed my first watch repair video.... and it was light, and delightful.  I might view another, as I doze off. Your movements, are clean, and you have a voice thats comforting. Like a atory book reading.   Allthough I do have a question, about pricing. Do you adjust the price of your repairs, dependant on the actual, or potential price of the watch? Or is it simply a flat fee? (Outside of necessary parts of course)  If a flat fee, Im guessing one pays a premium, because you can do high value watches, where as if I brought in a 2015 Swatch watch with Snoopy on the face, wouldnt be worth investing to fix.?  Hope that makes sense.
I really enjoyed watching that thank you
A $100,000. From 1958 ?!😅😂 Rolex had not created the "illusion" by increasing their $200.00 watch by 500% yet. One of -if not the Greatest- marketing ploys in international-retail history!😊
How much does that even cost to restore it?
Best with the sound off
Stunning job
MSRP as is????
I have seen some of these watches to be worn by the owner until the "Owner Dies" not the watch.
This came up in my algorithm for some reason. I’m not a watch repair person, but I sure found it very interesting. This is my second video of yours I’ve watched. Very cool!!
Does anyone remember the movie called the Hiding place?  The first half of the movie took place in a watch makers home. And his daughter worked in the shop with him.
#ASMRcrew
I really don't get watches $100,000 for this??! It is so ugly and dirty!  It also literally tries to kill you by being radioactive  I do respect the passion though and the excitement But it really makes no sense
That was very dangerous
Very cool vídeo and superbly narrated
10 рупій дам.
Thank you for uploading this video
Nice, impresionant
Beautiful video and beautiful voice over
So if you do a total disassemble and cleaning why do you align the hands before you remove them?
That’s a very expensive piece of radiation poisoning 😂😂😂
I have a 1934 tell watch for service  How can I contact you
I am an eye vitreoretinal surgeon  This is an art
Il costo è giustificato dal valore dei componenti lavorati👍
Thailand ❤
Just spent an hour of my life watching the cleaning and restoration of a Rolex. Remarkable.
Turn to  Jesus and repent of your sin
Your amazing
This is archeology.
This was so satisfying to watch.
the moment he opened the case back to reveal the movement was priceless.
This got my heart rate going sitting at my desk watching you sitting at your desk ... a year ago.  I love that the second hour hand is in 24 hour time.
The glass is not cracked from an impact. It is called crazing. It happens with a lot of plastics. It could have been in the presence of some sort of gas in storage or it could be from the radium off gassing radon. I have seen plastics when sprayed with certain cleaning solutions instantly craze and then crumble/disintegrate within seconds. This watch has had a lot more time around where it could have been exposed to all kinds of things.
Fantastic...I've never see a tear down and a rebuild of a watch before. You have very steady hands..  Great video.
I love your vids!
Well done
Wow! How many parts are there of the watch?
I have a Elgin pocket watch from the 1920s and have no one that I trust to work on it, it only ticks when you tap at it. it is a family heirloom would you be willing to oil it and get its heartbeat right for me?
You’re almost as good as the mechanics who rebuild auto transmissions. Amazing work!
Wow!  Amazing. Can’t believe how entertaining a watch repair could be!  You have major skills! 😅
well i just stumbled upon this randomly and after 52minutes I'm absolutely mesmerized. Also, I'm still convinced watches are sorcery, like what is going on here.. WHY DOES IT MOVE.
I am amazed at your talent.  I have my vintage Seiko from 1977 that needs restored and I would love to have you do it.  It's a very sentimental watch and could use your expertise.  I really enjoyed watching you work.
id get the watch and hand back a bag of clean watch parts and pieces. hats off toyou and all that do this
Nerve wracking watch or nuclear cracking watch 😂😂😂
Hmmm is it still divable?  Hey are you a certified Rolex tech?  Can not believed you replaced the crown??  That does looked like Charles watch.
Trabajo muy marrano.
It tickles me that the blue oil is the "heavy duty grease" of the watch world.
My heart rate was the same as if they were defusing a bomb throughout the entire video.
I don’t even wear a watch, but love these videos! Thank you for your patience and expertise…. Peace
Man you should cleaned this thing up way better man.... 1/5
😂
This is the second of your videos that I've watched while browsing the Rolex website for my first expensive watch.  Great content.
How much does a service like this cost?
Just discovered the channel. This is the most impressive content I've seen in an age. So fascinating and so well shot!
Shoulda put original bracelet back
This reminds me of tearing down and rebuilding a transmission
What would be the price tag on an all original watch like this?
Thats a perfect restauration for such a piece with history. Its completely clean and runs again like intended. But it doesnt look like its new, it still carries its history. And thats how it should be. Lots of restauration channels on Youtube try the full revert to new. But thats just so wrong on many items.
Beautiful
Wonderful, dig the GMTs👏🏻
hahahh😂😂😂
That ending was “priceless” 😂
Great video but at the end of the day, the dial has been refinished and thats such a pity and drastically affects the value. Still a stunning watch though.
I was born in November 1958.
Just don't have any screws or parts leftover when put back together!😅😊
This is absolutely insane. You are a real master of your craft sir. Wow.
Wow that $100000 watch would be a $10 watch with my shaky hands.😂
OMG.....this is sooo satisfying to see and how you do this, and I won't copy it, not even with a €10 watch, But this is sooooo nice to watch.
Wow!! What skill. Amazing.
I would not pay more than USD 1000 for this
What is the CPM for a banana, just so folks don't get freaked out about ( relatively low ) 'Counts Per Minute'.
Hi Marshall..Big Fan..Love your videos and Enthusiasm ❤ Locking the Crown to Stem you used Red Loctiite..Blue Loctite would be preferred as Red is More permanent than Blue if removing parts...FYI  In no Way am I criticizing you just a pleasant comment...Your the King for Sure Much Appreciated Sir Marshall  Lil Jimmy
The amount of parts they fit into such a small space is insane.
This video is a masterpiece!
I loved the video but I think what made me subscribe to you was the MTG mat I saw at the edge. Good job sir, I subscribe to you.
what are the fingergloves for? are they for saving the watch from fat and dust from the fingers or are they to prevent the small parts being attached to the fingers?
As a watchmen I'm embarrassed WATCHing this... You're abusing this watch, and destroying it. No care at all, terrible job. I hate you.
I didn’t know precious stones were in the watch
Is this something a novice could learn to do? I've amassed quite a collection of dress watches, fossil and timex ( I know...).I got so sick of not being able to close the case back after replacing batteries, I bought a press and a kit that I've gotten pretty adept at utilizing. Lately though, I've really been getting into vintage mechanical watches. The only one running being a 1980's Timex Acqua. My bf has brought a few home from an auction he works at and I've got an old Hamilton that my Grandfather acquired when stationed in France during ww2. That one runs, but loses time quickly. I'm not rich, but I could find the money for a kit. I know if I could find a video or even an old manual I could do this to an old watch ( I think ). This is an old video, so you probably won't see this, but on the off chance that you do, any suggestions?
How much!!!!!?
An unrestrained sneeze, and you would never see these small parts again!
Wish I could send you my heuer autavia, to see it revived
not radium, theyre made with uranium, less radioactive, less deadly
Anunsio.en.los.comersiales.de.yutu
Ok - who’s thinking about that scene in pulp fiction?
I’m not a huge fan of GMT’s but this one is the bees knees
Where can I get some of them small finger rubbers from ?asking for a friend
I'm curious if this watch would be safe to wear in light of the radium on the hands. Been going down lots of YouTube rabbit holes about radioactive substances 😱
Looks like the owner been using it while swimming in salt water and sun bathing  at the beach everyday.  Every season thru out the year never left out of his arm.  This is a precious gift for the owner
Dude is way too excited.
I need a watch restoration how do get in contact with you ?
If you can afford a $195,000 watch, then you can afford a 2 million dollar P-51 Mustang... um..I'd rather have the Mustang!!!  LOL.  Love your channel, you have some great and interesting stuff, learn a lot too!  Thanks for sharing.
I think that i would put a modern bezel on, but keep the original bezel and front crystal even though they are pressious, and fragile, the 2atch can be used without compramising the value as you still have the original bits
I can’t begin to imagine walking around with a watch with so much radioactivity 😮
I love your job sir. Thank you for video. So relaxing to watch
Great video! But is no one gonna talk about the fact that he’s wearing finger condoms
You know would be great is if you didn't talk during the video and just fix the watch
fake
I was not ready for that Geiger counter response 😂
It’s 2:30am and I watched a vintage watch repair. My life couldn’t get any better than this
Why using finger condoms when you can use latex gloves or similar?
Sheeesh 😵
Watching you remove that old gasket was more satisfying than watching  a pimple pop.
For roughly $100000 you can buy a two seat helicopter... crazy  Not saying that watch isn't an amazing piece of mechanical engineering but it doesn't fly lol
It is obvious that you have a passion and a love of watches. It is why you are able to do what you do!
I love this channel after a stressful day
I can’t believe how many layers there are
Do you offer classes?
A watch is a watch. It's not worth fixing. Just buy a new Timex or whatever at Walmart.
How do you remember where everything goes, especially the screws?
Thank you.  I’ve been having issues with the crown on my heirloom Rolex and you gave me an idea how to fix it.
I do think there is some collector value to damn near anything this well made, rare, and full of character, but I think it's a shame how the collector market has turned what were well made working people's watches into insanely expensive display pieces. An apt comparison would be vintage Gibsons and Fenders. While nowhere near the amount of precision and care was put into their production, they were by and large reasonably affordable working musician's tools in their day. Now even 70s through to early 80s Gibsons, widely regarded as the roughest era for build quality and physically apparent shortcuts in construction, have tripled in value or more over the last 10 years purely because collectors drive the market up. It keeps objects designed for a purpose out of the hands of people who would actually use them for that purpose, which to me is sad.
My hands were shaking watching this 😂
Thank you for very interesting video. Would you recommend any good Rolex service.
The ability to remember where every screw and part came from is nttn short of miraculous..I'd forget where 3/4 of these parts came from 😅😂😂😂
I have expensive watches and I don't wear them, for over the last twenty years I've worn Walmart ones, great looking for 10 to 15 dollars, and when the batteries stop I buy another watch. I have a half dozen, different colors some dress watches some sports watches. They work, and I get fatigued trying to get the expensive watches fixed because there are no watch people around anymore, they are all dead! Oh, and people are always asking me where I got my watch, no one ever asked where I got the expensive ones...
I truly enjoyed this video. Amazing work and I felt like I was there looking at you fix this with the detailed explanations and care. Truly amazing video and finished watch.  😊
Magic the gathering playmat spotted
Is this real life.... Lol
You are amazing! Your step by step explanations and expressive narrations are in themselves a fine tuned watch! Brilliant!
No damned watch is worth this much! NEXT…….
Where is the GMT hand???  Ahhhhh Never Mind…
Im always scared of anything that has radiation that high. Like I know its almost nothing that can cause dangerous amount of radiation poisoning  but i still wouldnt risk it by not wearting a head to toe hazmat suit 😭😂😂
How many hours did all that work took? How much did it cost?
I applaud you sir for the amazing work and for keeping that absolute beauty  as original as possible. Because yes!!! The vintage look is absolutely beautiful
I have a 1973 Elgin self-wider that my Father gave me on my 13th birthday with my initials on the back. I believe the main spring was replaced once. It's now over 50 years old & would like to have it properly serviced (like you just did). I'm in NY. Can you tell me where I could take it to have that done? Thanks.
My grandma probably sat the rubies in that watch for the bearings. Nice to see that.
This is one of my favorite Rolex of all time. I usually don’t like expensive watches but this one is beautiful
So how does one become a Rolex watch repairman ? I’ve never just seen it on indeed or a degree in college for it
At 33:50
you missed to set the Lock properly on the first jewel
That was impressive. Question tho, how do they make parts that small?  I would like to see the tool that makes those tiny screws
I bet it was on a wrist when they past
You are an artist with skills to restore it.   honestly, that thing looks so ugly I don't know why anyway would pay 100k for such a plainly designed watch.
Your skill is next level, Fully enjoyed every minute of this video, incredible how you do this.
Watched this on the shitter.  😅
does all the movement intricacies and when he gets to the gasket of the stem “it does get a lil tricky here” 😭😭😭
Hi!! Love your work.. I always wanted to work on watches.. I have an automatic Victoria Knox that I would love for you to work on.. how can I get in touch with you? The watch just doesn’t run right!
Happy for you!!
Mestari työssään👍♥️
I mean, back in the days, you don’t spend thousands of dollars just to have it on display. You’d wear the crap out of it. So the condition it’s in is reasonable I think. Anyway, great job getting it back to its former glory! Greetings from Switzerland 🇨🇭
Can someone please explain to me how and why a time telling device is worth more than a car?
Rolex ohne Seriennummer auf dem Deckel und mit so einem Schlackerarmband? Nie und nimmer. Das Teil kommt aus der Türkei von irgendeinem Basar. 🤷🏼‍♂️
why do I keep coming back to this video? I love this watch.
I said you're not letting out the parts in order that they were removed so you can put them back. You might not have to remember it. Cause you're skilled and probably done it a few times or if not hundreds. But it's good practice for beginners. Or novice to always make it a habit to lay oit the  parts in a row  that way. so there's never a huge problem. remembering what order they go back in. Especially  woth similar size parts
I’ve been watching you for years. This is my kind of meditation.
Cool! I’ve got an old Vinca Soviet watch that looks a lot like this one but someone stripped a gear by changing time at the wrong time and it stops about 10:30pm every night. Unfortunately there’s nobody around here that can work on it that I know of, and I’m not made of money, so it’s sitting and waiting for that repair hopefully in the distant future.
Wow! Just Wow! So impressive your patience and diligence to repairing this gem of a Rolex. I'm hooked. 🫡
It's amazing how many small parts and how many are inside a watch. Don't know how you remember how they go together. WOW
Why are you not putting all the Internal parts in a tray of solution rather than placing them all on the table.
Amazing video, watching the movement was poetry in motion, I'm not an enthusiast but I did thunk the face was squint a little to the left?
20:55 oh thank God, I thought the video was over.
wouldnt wearing this thing give you a exposure to radiotion of like a year in 5-6 hours ???
Be careful prying with a screwdriver. At 18:31, your screwdriver scratched the winding plate.
The cyclops is crooked
Same sentiments as many other viewers. Fascinating watching and fascinating watches to boot. Zen  channel. Love it 👏👍
Great job man. First rate work.
This watch is incredibly very complex!! And to think they made this in 1958!!! Incredible engineering!!!
Ill give ya $10 at best...not $100k.....too much money for a toy watch
I don’t know a single thing about watches or anything but what I do know is that I want a watch now
Can't believe you didnt show us the bezel going round.🤷
Working on a watch that can buy a house over a magic the gathering play mat is hard as fuck.
Wish you did pocket watches, because my late father's train watch needs servicing
I wouldn't have the patience to do this
Your videos are so soothing
The crystal is a mess,  but I wonder if there's something you could paint on the bezel to block the fumes
Whats the most expensive watch you have ever worked on?
I’m an electrical/mechanical engineer with nearly 40years experience  You just made me feel like a caveman
oh, I love watching you do this, awesome work, I would've lost half the parts, lol
doesn't the original strap have the serial number on it for authenticity and belonging to the watch ? you devalued it with a replacement strap
I just subscribed because this is just to amazing to see with your own eyes. Brilliant 🎉
Am 10’ and my married neighbour loves me.
$100k. People are ridiculous.
People question why Rolex is such an expensive brand. Watch this disassembly and cleaning and you will get it. Incredible job. I one day hope to own a Rolex and pass it down to my kids or grand kids.
Who's paying 100k for an ugly watch ??
Ten bucks says bakealite cause's cancer 😢
Your videos are sublime!, I couldn't help but notice your wearing your watch on your right hand and your right handed it's not very common, I do the same. Cheers and keep up this lost art form.
Excellent video. Thank you for denonstrating showing your expertise and skill and wonderful commentary!
2:38 you have to be really careful not to ingest this watch hahaha
As soon as you shined the uv light onto it i yelled “radium” 😅
Beautiful 👏
great show
I bet my surgeon had more shaky hands 😅 Mesmerizing to watch 👌🏼
Very good work, I am speechless👍
It’s still just a watch and it’s made out of dirt.  No need to worship anything physical.  As you can see, he couldn’t take it with him when he died.
Wow!
I’m pretty sure if I did this, and then put it back together…… I would have a bit left over!😂
11/1958… my birthday!
Slrry but... are you a comentator of Magic the gathering or Poker? Your voice sounds crazy familiar 😅
The videos would be alot better if you stopped talking😅😅
Great video great watch. I am going to say that the reason the lens looked the way it did is because of the radiation.
First time viewer- you related to cars and kept hard working. 14 minutes in this is incredible. Earned my subscription
I wonder what the bill was for this service
Amazing work 🫵🏆
I particularly liked the "Found in drawer!" tease.   Love to see what else was in there.  Like the Mercedes 300SL lightweight barn finds I'm always hearing about on YouTube.
Incredible. Thank you for the inspiration to learn watch servicing.
Beautiful and real efforts to fulfill the dream
Lol the wash water from the bezel is now radioactive waste...
Terrifying!
This makes me want to machine my own watch from scratch 😆  Great work 😍
20:55 Holy shit almost had a heart attack cuz I thought the video ended right there
I now understand the price of a Rolex.
talk so much tf
This guy's channel is not even at 1mil followers/members and the video has 8+million views. Thats totally insane and shows just how much people appreciate and are willing to watch skilled work.
I've held one of these, but I can't remember who it belonged to. I was very young.
its so strange that people dont buy watches like this to actually use. like why buy something so cool like this and not use it?
That was a real treat! Thanks for such a fantastic and detailed video
I‘m sorry to write this but the Dial are Not Original Rolex and so cost the Watch only about 20.000 $ !
Great work and a beautiful watch
Just fantastic
Should've left where he found it
OMG I accidentally found one of MTG's iconic Pro Tour commentators YT channel. Great stuff! I thought I was going crazy.
My older brother got my father's Rolex that looked exactly like this except new, on his 21st birthday, and lost it within 3 months.  I don't think he ever appreciated its worth!
Grease is good. Keeps the moisture away.
In my opinion the old oil going gunky is actually a great help to the end user. Your watch starts running slow - you know it's time for a service. Assuming it turns to glue before it becomes abrasive (someone please correct me if I'm wrong), it'll stop the watch running before you get a chance to wear something down.
It costs 60 k now
I can't believe it was 52 minutes.  I was enthralled!  Thank you for your company!
anyone who would spend 100 grand or 50 grand or 20 grand for this watch is nuts
I’m not the biggest watch person but I loved watching this restoration. How much is a restoration like this?I have an older watch I’d love to be restored
I never knew Rolex used radium…  Do you need a hazmat permit to work on that? 😅😅😅😅
Thts awesome, tht radiation was a shocking fact, idk if id be comfortable wearing it,  everything causes Cancer these days
Is it possible that crystal coming out is plastic or plexiglass?   I don't think glass can do that, plastic sure can.
What's the liability of working on a fragile $100K wristwatch? Does the customer sign a waiver?
This was therapy for me.
This is insanely talented. What do you charge for a restoration like this?
You sound like you are out of breath and dying
😅 amazing 😊
The fact that he's just setting all these tiny pieces on the table with no rhyme or reason (to me) is giving me so much anxiety because HOW DO YOU REMEMBER WHERE THEY ALL GO?? 😂😂
Glad you got to do it too .
Wow❤
The movie radium girls is great at explaining and showing the dangers of radium with the story based on girls who painted watch dials with said radium I greatly recommend 😌
How you remember where every part goes is beyond my comprehension
Great speaking voice and video.
This is something, as an enthusiast who’s recently decided to undertake the taking apart and restoring of a movement from scratch, piece by piece, I can relate to the feeling when you drop that seconds hand in and see it ticking and hear the mainspring working. I used a broken nh34 seiko movement as my brain as it was a very readily available movement and if something broke, another part could be easily sourced. I built the watch in the style of a (funnily enough) 6542! The cosmetics are in the style of a heavily faded 6542 to almost a coke look with a pumpkin lume. Normally I’m not a fan of fauxtina, but the the reasons I picked the case and dial is as because while the other bezels were ceramic(which ruins the vintage vibe for me), this bezel was a plastic replacement for Bakelite and the look and even the feel in the flesh took me by surprise by how consistent it felt to a real Bakelite bezel! But it’s protected from becoming brittle and cracking so it’ll hold up better over the years, and the dial was period correct in the hour and minute markings but I kept the dial 80% sterile to keep it from perpetuating(no pun intended) the idea that I wanted people to think it’s supposed to be a Rolex, so I made sure no branding, or “oyster perpetual” or chronometer certified were anywhere on it. I built it as a companion piece to the 6538 homage I built, which was my very first watch build. I can only dream of being able to sit and work on a movement such as this! But with my grandads 5513, I couldn’t ever take the risk of giving my hand a go at servicing the movement. But watching you sir, is highly enjoyable, great work and looking forward to future vids, subscribed!
OK, I am on my sixth or seventh time watching this and I just noticed that during this restoration you are also wearing a vintage GMT…Looks like maybe a 1675 from what I can tell by the bezel? I’ve been waiting a while to get a vintage GMT, and I got to fulfill that last year. I ended up with a 16750 because I wanted it to be older with a Plexi crystal, but I really wanted the quickset date, as this was not going to be a watch that sits in my case and never gets worn. Thanks so much for all of the content. You have such a great way of instructing and keeping it understandable at the same time.
This video is soo therapeutic to me ❤
The crazing in thebold crystal looks like UV damaged polycarbonate
im more wanting to know how with a radiation scored of over 1000 how does wearing this not slowly kill you
Please get a bowl for the screws and other parts 😫😫😫
Beautiful ❤❤❤
Love your videos, but It hurts when you doesn't align the screwdriver precise in a screw bigger than the screwdriver, https://youtu.be/zQhHQ7pkBf8?t=968 that screw got damaged...
Wow!
Wow that is a relatively dangerous amount of ionizing radiation coming off of that. I certainly wouldn’t wear it more than once a week or so, and would keep it in a lead box far from my bedroom lol
Sir, I may have a very similar watch that I would like to sell.   Is there a way to contact you?  Thank you.
I would always reserve the crown a bit, while pushing down, until I feel it dropping into the barrel thread with a click, then screw it down.
That watch is absolutely F'in gorgeous
Beautiful ❤ you made my OCD in me very happy 😊
lol that watch was made 9 yrs before I was born lol
Why are my hands shaking when you’re doing all this intricate work?
Shop   Hq
Me and my son, 42 and 9 y old, are huge fans! We re gonna start and learn more witnh u!!
The cracks on the crystal could actually be the effects of radiation damage from the dial and hands. Excellent video by the way.
Wonderful restoration and super satisfying video. I wonder, though, with genuine curiosity; do you call it 'beautiful' because it is old and valuable, or do you truly, aesthetically find it 'beautiful'? Because in my eyes it's a very clunky, ugly watch. Especially the colour combo on that bakelite and its bulky design makes it look like a kid's watch from the '90s.
You are so clever, thank you .for a great vidio .. John uk
I honestly think the bezel design with the numbers on this watch and other rolexes is super ugly.
So is it safe to wear a watch like this with all that radiation? I have a 1971 gmt and idk if I should wear it at all or just get rid of it.
this is big job like bank robery
I wonder what the reading on the Geiger counter would be if you tested it open like that🤔💚🇺🇲
Never in my 40yrs did I ever think I was going to love a video like this, but I do. Great flick.
I’m about to buy vintage, just to send it to you to get serviced lol
I love the way you describe the steps and parts you handle. Thanks so much.
WOW! U deserve a trophy 🏆 just for remembering how to put this watch back together 😂😂
Thinking that lens looks like it has solar damage. That’s one of the only things I’ve seen cause that kind of spidering on acrylic
Same watch costs £10000 now
Looks like a pretty hard and delicate skill  as far as the watch I’m not seeing Beauty I understand it’s vintage and that’s why it looks like those $100 Timex watches I’m sure it looked special for that time period though
How much was the crystal?
Great Vid thank you for the hour of schooling most interesting
Great video. Thank you for all the commentary. Amazing watch!
You know its a ripoff when the bezel alone costs thousands2 of dollars. Thank God for my smartwatch.
I'm jealous of this guy and his ability to successfully restore all these watches. Bloody brilliant!.
one sneeze away from oh shit!! lol nice videos
This was fascinating. Wow
Why wearing a radioactive watch?? Isn’t that a health hazard???
I don’t how much u charge to repair watches, but from watching this video I can say u don’t charge enough. I’m amazed.
Late 50s, 60s & 70s- probably the best watches Rolex produced. The new mass produced machine made ones don't compare!
it's crooked by like the smallest inch to the left. should have rotated the face to the right one bit
Only thing changed was the crystal and crown, alongside the bracelet and springbars. Really good! Had fun watching your video
Wonderful. I share your joy.
Wonderful video, but that was an absurd number of ad breaks
August 1967 I arrived in Chu Lai, Vietnam with the Seabees.  Our first paycheck in country we ran to the PX to buy items that were sold cheaply. Nikon cameras, reel to reel tape recorders, etc, etc. In my unit were a few Philippinos who elected to buy watches. I heard a group of them talking excitedly about what a great buy they had made. They were very happy to have purchased such a luxury item for a great price. I examined one of the watches, asked how much he had paid. He said $400 and I almost fainted. I had never heard of paying over $100 for a watch. I asked what kind of watch it was and he said it's a 'Rolex'. And I said, 'what's a Rolex?.
Was a car, truck, & maintenance mechanic for over 60 years and ‘fine tuned’ repairs such as this is absolutely fascinating! #takesasteadyhand!
Outstanding video sir! So freakin cool. Thank you for sharing!
Very nice watch. Outcome was stunning. I'm just so worried of the radiation to wear it
wao! amazing! you had a gmt master on your wrist there!  😆
This is dangerous, just notised that I have old pocket watch in my drawer.. That can't be that hard, can it?
Possibly my favourite watch you’ve done. Simply gorgeous and a wonderful, detailed repair
So satisfying to watch. Engaging commentary. Super 👍🏽
Seth Rogen is speaking 😂
How do you learn to keep up where each piece goes? I understand repetition, but when starting out. It seems very easy to forget where each part goes
Imagine the delight of the owner to see it when it returned, knowing how it left...
What an amazing video.  What a beautiful watch.  Your camera work is wonderful and these 52 mins were an absolute joy to watch. Thank you very much indeed.  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
is it just me ---->.  or. ARE WE LOOKING at an ACTUAL. 24 hour watch. !????                        Those alone were not all that common , were they ? ?
why would someone pay 75k for radioactive peace of junk
props to you for touching radium on that old dial
Where was the radioactive material coming from?
Probably could’ve just dropped the watch in parts solvent and saved yourself a lot of trouble.
Probably could’ve just dropped the watch in parts solvent and saved yourself a lot of trouble.
I work to do but I kept telling myself, just a few more minutes, and the next thing I know, I finished watching your video.  Well done.
Watching from Johannesburg, South Africa. Amazing experience. Thank you for sharing.
Absolutely mind blowing! You are incredible knowledgeable and skilled. Thank you for sharing this video.
What a great video.
Super job, it looks fantastic.
Been watching your vids for years. So relaxing and satisfying. Keep up the great work.
What an incredible job you did. What a gorgeous watch. I bet that was an experience to remember.
What an amazing repair!!
So beautiful restoration. You are the best.
I finished without blinking hahahaha im so mesmerized watching this come back to life wow amazing❤😊
Lovely slow tv 🤩🤌🏻
What the hell is on ur fingers 😮
It blows my mind to think this watch is only worth $100,000 when it's more than 60 years old and starts right up like nothing happened. For anyone who thinks Rolex isn't worth the money, they're misinformed.
Great Job you’re such a pro
Seeing 900 cpm gave me intense anxiety for a second 😅 cpm only refers to the number of events taking place, not the strength of the radiation in question...obviously it's nothing to worry about in this case but typically 100 cpm would be cause for concern seeing 900 made my heart race 😂 love your videos
Nice work! Now i understand why these Rolex whatch cost so much. Crafsmanship, just A piece of Art.
Wow i have two watches for you to fix, haha, my old boss was telling me about you over Christmas and you are unbelievable my friend.
I bet it was a military guy. Seems like the super rare watches from the 50s and 60s made by Rolex, we bought at military bases and military catalogs.
200k
If putting a man on the moon was difficult enough. I have no idea what I just watched. I mean you have a machine that pushed down the hour and minute hands!!!
Sorry. Even though I would love to have one of your watches I live on a fixed income. Your watches are way out of my league.
When did Rolex stop using the screwed balance wheel and why?
Did watch servicing start with you or was this passed down ?
Nice movie loved it❤❤❤
Your abilities are amazing
Wow. You are a spectacularly talented individual. What a skill set. As a lover of automatic wrist watches, to me you are a rockstar. I’m curious how much you would charge for a restoration like that. Amazing work.
I will appreciate a watch a lot more, the intricacy of building watch is by far impossible to describe…definitely can see why they are worth the price
Impressive restoration.
Marshall do you sell these repaired watches?
i love how the commentary is in real time as u rewatch the work u previously performed. this needs to be on the OCHO
Would you care to to say what was the restoration cost on this was?
Crazy, I had this exact watch. I'd never forget it. Back around in 85 or earlier. No joke. Just like this one, no strap
Master
this is crazy nice
Being a recovering alcoholic I've been sober for twenty two years. Taking a watch like this apart would definitely be a burden on my sobriety.  Love watching the video though...
What an awesome episode, Marshall!  And what a gorgeous watch you returned to your client!  Your excitement about working on such a beautiful piece was so fun and so very contagious!  It prompted me to join your Patreon membership ranks, and I can’t wait for your additional great content!    I happen to own a Rolex 6542 and need to find a set of original hands for it.  Do you have any ideas as to where I might look or any direction you might be able to give me?  I’d be grateful for any at all.   Thank you again!
I have a question about my watch
A unicorn of a watch, I'm quite jealous
I would deem that a Clean and Service. Not a restoration as you didn’t touch the Case. Meaning polishing. However, I’m sure that polishing would have ruined the desired patina. Awesome work as usual.
Thank you for this awesome video. What really blows my mind is what a beautifully crafted work of art this movement is and you‘d never see it on these watches.
100 grand? wow..
Very good job. Wow
My finances won't allow me to purchase a Rolex, I do love watches, the diver watches from Invicta with the Seiko movements are incredibly durable. I've had mine for years with no problems ,I put it through the test, believe me! Invicta gets a bad rap but bang for your buck you will never find a better watch
This guy never lost a game of "Operation " 😂😅😂
I counted 23,347 screws 😂😅
Marshall! Love your videos!   Where would I find an entry level watch to work on and what watch would you recommend. Merry Christmas to you and your family.
What camera are you using for your presentations? For the tiny parts you deal with,  it has great focus.  Love watching your videos . Thank you :)
OMG! So great! I would never get this reassembled again! A miracle!
I wonder if the cracking on the crystal is from thermal expansion? Maybe it got left in the sun in a hot car or something?
How much did this repair cost?
You’re great man! But please, you should speak a Little bit less
I can change a battery in a watch, but taking a Mechanical Watch Apart looks Terrifying !
I think that a scientist could spend years studying the amazing amount of physics and engineering that goes into the design of watches like this.
What happens when a watch is in a airplane?  Time flying
Thanks for not playing background music.
Brilliant work.
i am so free that i watched whole video
I have to comment... this was something that wouldn't normally interest me, yet I sat captivated the entire video.  The production quality blows all the public and private TV stations away.... this was phenomenal content!!!
MAMACOO has set a new standard for replica watches. Their craftsmanship is impeccable. Its hard to tell the difference from the originals
Fantastic job!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Owned two of these. Amazing to see how they work and their quality. Great narrative. Just to augment your talk: GMT stands for Greenwich Mean Time, the Prime Meridian that runs through Greenwich In the UK, and pilots & air controllers work on that time zone regardless of where they are in the world -keeps confusion to a minimum as aircraft crews cross time zones. The 24 hour hand keeps track of GMT on the adjusted bezel while the pilot keeps local time or, as you suggest, the time at home.
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Congratulations!  Very nice work.  It's a pleasure to watch your talented steady hand restore a golden oldie! Excellent camera work as well.  Q? Does the watch owner know this watch is worth like $100,000??
Dude you MUST read The Radium Girls by Kate Moore. Once I saw that Geiger counter I thought of that book immediately.
Your knowledge on watch making is astonishing. I’m a lifetime subscriber from today on. Thank you.
Thanks for no annoying music bed!
I get this watch is from 1958, but not being able to find the end link surprises me!
Is this the one that was found on the British tv show dickensons real deal ?
Très bon travail, je ne comprend pas pourquoi il n’as pas polis la carcasse…
It's an engineering masterpiece.   Thanks for sharing❤❤
Patina will come off the dial and bezel using the proper technique. I have detailed many high end vintage cars, planes, boats, etc. Magic eraser with soapy water works very well or a microfiber towel and some windex and or soapy water. I am not suggesting scrubbing at all but rather gliding over gently. Practicing on a less valuable watch like an old Gruen would give you confidence with this technique. If you much more prefer the patina then disregard. I prefer a vintage item that looks as perfect as possible, but I am a detailer so what do you expect.
Love this. Not sure how much tools and common parts cost..and id be scared of a complaint, how can you prove that your not switching the movment? Do you litterly have to film your work in case u need to take a client to court? And  show your work non stop?..if u had to order parts and wait how long from rolex for them? Is it rewarding cash wise aside from personal gratification? Gotta ask!
Hi Marshall... Im writing this about a year after you put this video because I just inherited a Rolex from my Gramps with the same crystal damage of this watch , and he was the one that damaged it ! He was replacing the crystal after taking it out to 'fix the leaking' when reinstalling he was pressing it back in with a pair of vice grips and cloth (to protect from damaging it !😅) . So in case that damaged crystal was still a mystery , there's one answer !  Best regards , Nate 😊
Hey man, you pop into my feed from time to time whenever I see one of your videos I watch it entirely. I enjoy what you do I think it’s really cool to see all this. You do a great job in the process. I never subscribed so I’m just letting you know I just subscribed and I’d love to see more in the future. I have one of the Yacht Masters. Because I sell Yachts for a living so I thought it was fitting, but keep it up, man I enjoy watching the show.
Amazing. And, thank you for the education throughout the video.
the perfectionist in me xD almost passed out several times on how you bang up them small screws and scratching the movement of the watch made me crinche but other then that amazing work and amazing watch just the amount of parts and detail is just stunning
Great job.
Man that movement is beautiful
9:00 If your surname is Sutcliffe, then we're probably distantly related.  *Hello distant cousin* !!
I Know nothing about rolex apart from its price. This channel popped into my feed. I felt an attraction? connection? to that watch!! It looks awesome!!! even beat up!!
👍🏻😮‍💨
😮‍💨👍🏻
I Nenner had my Rolex serviced but don’t know where to bring it. Can I send it directly to Rolex or can I send it to someone else you recommend that’s cheaper.  Not trying to save money just want a good job to someone I trust.
It was a joy to hear your process and plans for restoring this beautiful vintage Rolex watch. Every step of the way I was learning the names of each part and its function. Your care and joy as you restored it for your client (who by the way chose the perfect person), made me even more interested in vintage watches.  The history of this watch is a masterclass in design, precision, and beauty.  I would like to know when you remove every part of the watch which has many layers and screws, is there an order to how you organize the parts, or is it because you know each part and screws regardless of the layers you are working on? Thank you for the excellent close up photography as a visual tool to understand the assembling and disassembling of watches. I look forward to your films. Happy holidays.
Beautiful work!!!
How could you possibly put those pieces back together! OMG!
In the beginning, did you just separate parts as they came off into different containers so that you knew where they came from because all I see is a pile of parts on that counter that Matt and I just don’t understand how you could recognize where they all go, I would have to believe at least most of the time I would separate them
Are you color blind? It’s black and red… my friend has a cola Rolex, his dad has a collection of the hulk, Pepsi etc Rolex. My friend gets whatever his dad wants to gift to him. I’ve seen Rolex old navy blue watches, their new ones and about any in between. That is more black than blue if anything, the watch dial is black. The surrounding ring is very dark with a tiny tint of blue. I honestly have no clue why people like these watches. If it comes to time being as correct as possible Grand Seiko is still the top as far as I know, other than that smart watches are far superior, they don’t only show time but can navigate, call, message etc with a SIM card. My friend that I talked about has like 6-8 Rolexes in his safe, he wears none of them. Just his old Apple Watch for actual usage.
Absolutely amazing 52-minute movie with twists and turns. Watching him spring into action was great.
I don't know why this landed up on my Youtube Home page but am flabbergasted. Absolutely astonishing. Worth every second I spent watching this. The knowledge/workmanship speaks a lot about your skill. Hats off.
Thank you for making high quality videos!Love MAMACOO watches
Simply beautiful!
That’s beautiful work right there man.
Super cool, but holy commercials, Batman.
Nooooo! Why did you replace the crystal? It was a beautiful crackled patina and gives the watch its authenticity. Put it back!
50:26 there is a hair 😮
Beautiful watch, beautiful work, beautiful story. Thank you.
So since the bezel can crack so easily why not putting some soft cloth under the case while removing the ring ?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That moment when this pops up on your feed and you realize you have this watch all original from your grandfather......
100k? I'm a strong believer in people put the value they believe into things. Id rather flip 100k to make a million to then flip that million to make 10 million... My circadian rhythm
I found it entertaining, never watched anything like that before , very satisfying 💯
Professional! Wow
Master watchman!
That dial looks a little suspicious to me😢
First time in the channel and tjis watch is a GIs watxh just in case its not clear the reason why its so gunky...i give u one word ...Nam
I’m 17 minutes in, and blown away. You’re one of the easiest channels to watch. Great video. Sub 4 life.
Wanted to see it on the Geigermeter after it was finished. Sad face. But great work.
I like listening to BoJack horseman fix the watches
Stunning job lovely job .... thank you very much indeed.
This is tymosurgery respect for you sir
that was incredible. what a beautiful watch and what great work you did on it!I love MAMACOO watch!! Dream watch! Everytime I wear it, makes me feel amazing!
Absolutely loved this video
That’s most beautiful antique watch I seen, wow .
God the vintage GMTs are so iconic. I'd be so tempted to keep it in its original condition because of all the history it's been through, but the restoration looks sooooo stunning as well!
Surface tension.  Capillary action is an emergent behaviour because of surface tension.
Man I couldn't even take apart my nintendo wii properly, there was a leftover screw and metal piece. I can't even imagine keeping track of all these small pieces and screws lmao
I’ve tried a few times to contact you via IG without success
A work of art, should be in the Louvre museum above the Mona Lisa. Looking at how small some of the parts are you must have eyesight like a shithouse rat.
Paying 100k for a watch is the dumbest sht ever
I am an amateur watch maker and I could watch these videos all day long. Thanks a lot
Why did you not clean the hands?
Teach me your ways 😂😂😂 That’s skill right there.
After the bull run I'll buy one
I can appreciate that vintage high class watches have an increased value, but I must ask is….is the movement made with precious metals and jewels?
At 15:37 something flies out from where the clutch wheel is situated and vanishes into the void underneath the barrel. I've watched it a dozen times at 0.25x speed but can't tell. What was it?
Thank you for sharing
Very interesting.................
To think that’s worth the same as a Ferrari or a small house , incredible , well done on the great work restoring this beauty 👏
What a fantastic programme  you def have a new subscriber , well done Gary from Leeds England
I would've seriously considered replacing the bazel and keeping the original one separate from the watch, just to protect it.
Stunning watch. Brilliant job sir 👍
good pro
Is it gold is it iron is it a appel
You're a genius.
Love the "Magic the Garthering" pad. hahaha
I wonder how many VCRs, 8 track players, and other household appliances this guy took apart as a kid 😂
these aren´t worth anywhere near 100k
I couldn’t care less about watches, but yet here I am watching an hr long video about watch maintenance.
Great job,but to small on a man's wrist,
How in the world did they make those small parts and screws back then?
Wrist cancer lmao
The power source is the human 😂. Doing just stores the power. Of course I’m just being smart. Love your Chanel
Where do you get replacement screws, gears, jewels, etc...?
Hi I have one in same condition... My grandpa watch Pls MSG me if you wanna buy
Super work sir u did tremendous cleaning over oiling everything.
Condition issues?
Here's another thing you can actually find very very low in watches that are extremely high detailed and the mechanisms are extremely good and they have a high attention to detail for 1,000 of a fraction of the price this is what I say people Rolexes are just like Gucci t-shirts you have brands with just as good of material for 4050 bucks when it comes to a T-shirt and then you have a Gucci t-shirt that has a 500 dollar price tag on it it's all about brand it's all about what people think is Top Notch technology or Cutting Edge design it all depends on the person's taste
Oh I promise you the designer put the peace symbol or the Mercedes symbol because of fucking Mercedes if that wasn't the case sir they would have made it much easier and just actually put a cross a lying down and a line across and then they would have had more little spots to place their luminous material and it would have dried even better and gave even more of a luminous effect so trust me there was some thought behind that😅😅
😮‍💨
Every single time you touched that bezel, my heart rate increased substantially!  Excellent video!
Thanks youtube for reminding me to fix my own Daytona 500 rolex. Going to have to really do that at some point.
Great work, but meh just a watch.
My Lord, If I had done this it would be running backwards that's if it ever ran again. Great job man!
Plastic bezel, extremely fragile watch face… wtf makes it worth so much? Watches are the same as paintings where all they need is a “professional” to quote it at $100,000 and suddenly it’s worth that much
Dude you had me nervous watching this repair 😂! Awesome work
How do you remember how to put it all back together? I mean, all your screws look randomly placed on the bench.
How much would a restoration like this cost ?
Anyone who would pay 100k for this watch may want to see a doctor
You have a wonderful talent and have performed a true service to this wonderful precision machine. I am awe stuck with your patience and skills.  The patients and skills of the original tool makers, the engineering are just amazing it would be a real treat to see the manufacturing equipment to make all these precise pieces. Thankyou for taking the time to produce a very informative well presented program.
Man that Speedy NATO strap is amazing! Off topic, but really nice.
I was lost when my hour glass got plugged up 😮
.         If it's I who is doing it: after almost everything was screwed up, oiled, hours of effort later... just to discover an important spring or screw in the lowest layer was left out! Everything has to be disassembled AGAIN! 😑🤦‍♀️
.         What is the rationale of replacing the main spring?😅 Doesn't look like it's damaged~
.        The most incredible thing to me, from my own experience, is: *NONE OF THE SCREWS WAS STUCK !!!!* How was this even possible??!! 😅
Is it safe to wear or handle a watch that has radium on the bezel itself without a crystal shielding it?
It’s interesting that this was built at a time before the technology we have. It’s amazing!
Wow very interesting video never thought I would like a video like this , what a masterpiece of a watch and you are very good at what you do sir . Thank you
To many long commercials.. darn it ! It is officially the most commercials I’ve ever had on a video on YouTube.😢
Dam that is an amazing watch
How or why this video showed up and I clicked on it, ill never know? But! like 50% of the comments, I watched the entire video for some reason and loved it. I'm now behind on my day but it was worth it. great video mate.
It's always pleasing to watch you disassemble and reassebmle the watches 👍 great video as always.
I don´t want to tell you this to ruin your day, but I cried like a baby when I watched this video. I lost my dad, 20 months ago, at the beautiful age of 90 years old and, despite the fact that he has been too many things during his life, his first and most important qualification was that he was a watchmaker. He was born in northen Portugal, in 1932, and learnt this office at 11 and 12 years old, during the WW II,  by watching his uncle (also a watchmaker) working on watches during the long and cold winter nights in the small town of Chaves, where he held his little shop, in the main street of those days. My father later on immigrated to Brazil, where he worked as a watchmaker for Rolex, among other companies, in São Paulo, during the 50´s and 60´s. When I was born, in 1967, he was already a successful owner of one of the main jewelry shops in São Paulo. Even then, he would do some of the main works himself. And I look at your equipment and I see you working and I can recognize some of the equipment he had and he used. Things for which I never knew name or use. Some of them I knew. Like the washing machine that you use at minute 20 in your video. I saw my dad putting pieces in those baskets in putting the baskets in those cilinders, just like you did, and I couldn´t hold it. So, I´m telling you that, no matter how important is this watch for their owner, you just brought back to me memories that are worth a lot more than those $100.000 this Rolex could cost. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I´ll try to finish watching the video, now, but I wanted you to know that you have touched a soul with your video. I´m pretty sure this would worth a lot to you, as well. Thank you. Ismael Silva.
Very enjoyable to watch.  Stunning
Just seen this wow you did amazing job
100k for this?!! 10 bucks at most
Man you sneeze it’s game over 😂
I've rebuilt plenty of Roadrangers, but I would really hesitate to disassemble a Rolex.😊
Beautiful ❤
Das beste Werkzeug für die Restauration ist ein guter Hammer🤣🤣🤣🤭
Why don’t you use an ultrasonic cleaner? Seems like that parts washer is quite aggressive. Also how do you clean off the solvent? Thanks for all the great info.
Do work on seiko watches
I love watches and this content and channel are awesome what a gifted and talented watchmaker you are. Keep up the great work.
Epic Video
That was great!
Amazing !!
I saw you changed out the head of the crown with a replacement but when you did that  i did not see you put in a seal. At the first time you did it but then at the end when you noticed the thread didnt hold on you changed the head but not the seal. Anyway nice video.
Sir …. You are amazing as the watch you are restoring back to life….
I have some old bakelight items and I agree they will shatter, Very cool old watch and Great job.
Looks too tedious for me. I’ll stick with cars. How many hours does it take for a watch like this?
Seth Rogan does watch restorations now?
Why you sound like the Divorced dad Card game guy.
Amazing that is beautiful and what a brilliant job. Was a pleasure to watch
nice
So over priced I can get a used oyster perpetual for 3 grand lol
What an experience.  Thanks for sharing it with us.  It's not everyday that you get to experience a service of this magnitude.  My heart was pounding with that dial function.  Good Job man.  You are officially the GOAT now.  Greatest of all time.
Who is out here shitting up a storm while watching this ⛈ 🚽
Why is this so fascinating? I've binge-watched several of these in the last several days. Masterful display of technical / manual prowess.
just a watch
Bravo😊
You are a surgeon of wrist watches _ the attention to detail is amazing!
My first watch restoration video. I'm glad it was this one. This was very enjoyable and very informative :)
i kept thinking i know this voice... then 10min in notice the mtg playmat 😂
Watching him work on such an iconic pepsi GMT is the most fun I've had involving Rolex for years. He's a brave man to dive into such a rare watch. I don’t think I could keep track of all those parts. Thanks so much for posting! Cheers!
Beautiful work by a true artist
Beautiful watch, excellent, sympathetic restoration.
I thought your voice sounded familiar and realized you were the same Marshall from hours of draft content I've watched. Wild!
Here i am patting myself on the back for successfully changing a blown head gasket and  reinstalling the cylinder head AND getting the timing right on my Toyota Hilux  AND having it start afterwards first pop....i feel totally emasculated and humbled after watching this. Thank you sir!
Vous êtes un magicien 🤩❤🔥
How come someone forget a Rolex lol
You already ruined this watch by removing the original glass
I can't believe i have watched this whole video
Why is Neil De Grasse Tyson narrating?
I own two Omegas today and have been into watches since I was a kid in the 1980’s and had my first cheap, plastic, digital Casios.  But seeing inside of fine watches just amazes me at what humankind has been able to engineer over time.  Even cars today are just mind-blowing when you think about the full picture of all of the thousands of elements that go into them.  But getting into things like fighter jets or supercomputers?  Wow.  I can barely understand how things thousands of times simpler work.

love it.
i wish i could get you to look at my Geneve that even Rolex in NY attempted to repair...love watching your vids tho
Hi sir how can someone get in touch with you to have a watch repaired ?
Yes, I have bought from AMZWATCH more than once.  I even bought a new Omega Speedmaster which came with the fancy box and packaging. I am thrilled with all my purchases here.  I would purchase from AMZWATCH again for sure.
Incredible. I don’t even own a watch anymore due to work. But I came across this and as an a/c mechanic I’m in awe. This was incredible to watch. Thanks so much
seems like radiation over the years fucked up the crystal...
Excellent workmanship on this collectors Rolex GMT,steady hands and a good horoligist brings this watch back to life,the owner will be thankfull.
Bu saat o kadar etmez en önemlisi erkeğe kadınlık yapamaz yani alt tarafı metal parçası o kadar ancak salaklar para verir
I just don't see the attraction of Rolex. They are ugly.
LOVE your insights and discussion. Brings the thing to life SO much. Hugely enjoyable.
That’s a beautiful watch.
The born to fly spring sounds like a jesus clip for crank windows!! Live and learn 😆
I don't even like watches per se, I'm more into building ebikes, solar arrays and stuff like that - I really enjoy watching you working through the mechanical side of things though.
How do you put this back together without having extra parts when finished?
How in God's name are these parts machined .  They all look  individually made.
MY GRAND DAD JUST SOLD HIS ROLEX, EXACT YEAR AND MODEL WE SEE HERE , VERY GOOD CONDITION ( NOT NEW )...FOR 225 K U.S. DOLLARS..WITH ORIGINAL BOX AND PAPER WORK  !!
Veja isso @gmt-3
absolutely amazing work!  beautiful watch.
I love that you explained what each part was called and what it did, made for a very informative restoration video!
Did I just watch the whole 52 minutes?😂😂
i think the glass had so muny cracks because of lot of sun exposure
Awesome effort and very informative!  Would you consider servicing a 1982 Seiko Turtle?  This diver has accompanied all over the world on dives and kept me safe. Please consider the effort for me.  Bob
Very Impressive. I love the look of those watches too.
AMAZING
Watch are the ultimate Men's accesories！Enjoyed watching your collection. Keep going！As a watch enthusiast and watch reviewer,  I can say AMZWATCH this was a great choice. Enjoyed your video!
Wow! Thank you for this video! It was pretty fantastic to see all the amazing details and detailed narration
Nothing says "safety" like aging bakelite implanted with Radium. I swear people used to treat getting cancer like a competitive sport.
Great work! I really enjoyed watching the process. Amazing service on such a valuable timepiece! I'm curious—what safety measures did you take to handle the radioactive components? Did you wear a mask or take any other precautions?
Your work, commentary and video quality is most impressive! However, I do have some questions for you. What are the standard dimensional tolerances? Do you inspect wheel (gear) teeth for wear and proper mesh and verify that pivots (stems) are perpendicular to the wheels and have the proper clearances to their respective bearings?  You often use peg sticks to break hardened debris from cases. What is your take on a soak in Dawn Dishwashing soap w/ DI water, maybe Simple Green, Never Dull and or Goo-Be-Gone (all excellent non-abrasive cleaners and polishing agents)?
Gotta love a watch with patina. I'd love to have one like this beauty.
The voice was driving me insane until the add for Sutcliffe website and that moment of realizing its Marshall Sutcliffe was mind blowing
I thought those were your actual fingers in the intro 💀
Is my Timex from the 60's valuable ?
First time seeing your video. I was thinking about starting it as a hobby and watch you and this video had me hooked!!  Fantastic work brother! Thank you for sharing your knowledge.
Yo best video I’ve seen in a long long time. Very well educated kept the conversation clean and well spoken. Doing the shoutouts during a super interesting cleaning process was 1000% the correct move. Well done bravo.
Those watches look really beautiful on the inside, I had no idea they had that much detail and worked that they put on the inside of those watches. Sitting here thinking about if I could do that. It seems like peaceful work. I'm disabled, 55 years old 🗝️ I don't know if I have the hands for it 🫣  Thank you so much for putting so much work into your tutorials. I believe I watched 5 of them on this good Sunday. Straight in a row 👀 It really takes a lot to get my attention. Sir you got my attention 🥳🎇 thank you. Ps, I totally forgot to give you a thumbs up cuz I've been watching it from my phone to the TV but I'm sure I'll go over them again and correct that.  I'm just a little afraid that I would break something, something of that magnitude in history I surely would not want to be the one to break it 🫣
Absolutely stunning, and your situational awareness was hypnotizing quite frankly!!
Why is it special?
My goodness. For the past 5 years I’ve owned a Breitling Super Ocean II as my daily driver. This watch on my wrist has experienced an incredible life of things only one can imagine in only the some 6 short years of its life (including display shelf time). It always runs slow, even from the beginning when I bought it new, but I didn’t and don’t mind as it has become such a part of me. This is the only watch that has lasted this long and still ticks. The first time they had to send the watch back to Breitling Switzerland for months, so I stopped going back to the jeweler after that, as I couldn’t bother. I guess I always suspected, but I never realized until watching this, how many parts and screws there are to a Swiss timepiece. LOL I guess I now realize I need to get my watch serviced. Thank you for your channel and this video. This was a learning experience I shall never forget.
link to the auction site?
Man it's so cool to listen to Neil degrassi tyson take apart watches.
Very good work 👍💯
You’re doing a great job creating these videos.
Not sure what's more amazing...how many fricken parts are in a watch,or the fact he can take it apart and remember where all that goes back in precisely
If someone had ever told me that I would watch a video where someone disassembles and cleans a watch FOR AN ENTIRE HOUR, I would not have believed that person's words for anything 🤣
I don't know or care about watches. But I am always impressed with the workmanship that goes into handling all the tiny pieces that make a watch work.
Ever since I bought a watch from AMZWATCH, My question is if it's this hard to tell them apart, what is the point of owning an authentic watch?
Did the bezel turn when cleaned I presume not as you never twisted it
Your a gem of a watchmaker
I cant understand how or why people allow watches especially expensive watches like this to be reduced to such poor quality
I was nervous the entire video
Great job! Your a master of your craft.
ugly worn out watch, need to refurbish the hour and minute hand, and bezel too
So an ugly plastic watch is worth that much?..
Stunning watch , brilliant video .
It fascinates me to imagine the people that first imagined and created the first time peices. The imagination a problem solving is inspiring This is the watch version of my RC30 Honda Special
Mind blowing, suitably impressed
This just makes me realize how blind I am
It's Bakelite not Bake-a-lite. Otherwise great video
Randomly popped up on my FY here, watched the whole thing - but your website does not work. I tried it on several browsers, and nothing. Anyone else have this issue?
Wow!!! What a great episode to watch...I couldn't wait for that final bezel install. Excellent care and work and of course your commentary to share your knowledge :)
it still looks like fake from 90s, i wouldn't pay 3 bucks for it.
Maybe the watch was in a fire?
Thank you for making high quality videos!Love AMZWATCH ’s watches
Simply Amazing !!
Wonderful. I have a 1996 non date Submariner which runs fine and hasn’t been serviced since 2005 and I’m not sure what to do with that.
I just got into watch collecting. I've loved watches since I was young but I never had anyone teach me or bring deeper into the world. AMZWATCH brought closer to a community and hobby I always wanted to get into more and that is incredibly meaningful to me !
On comprend pourquoi ces montres coûtent aussi cher .....  Très beau travail. Bravo !
Paying €100,000 for such an ugly watch and then it's radioactive. Exactly my sense of humor.
Nice job! No clue how you remember where half the parts go! Coming soon near you ! 1950 china Rolex clones lol
Amazing job my brother. Your dedication and skill is outstanding to perfection. God bless you and the family and your amazing work
No one cares what watch you wear except you. So as the man says, take your time. Buy what you like. Enjoy life.MAMACOO
Loved it ❤
Ever since I bought a watch from MAMACOO, My question is if it's this hard to tell them apart, what is the point of owning an authentic watch?
I can really appreciate the skill and enthusiasm in this restoration but then can`t share the affection to the looks of this watch. I think the design of this watch is very mediocre.
I wish I could have learned this trade when I was a kid!
The algorithm brought me here...and I stayed for the whole thing. Wow. Super knowledgeable, with nerves of steel. I was expecting your dialogue to be dry, geeky, and boring but you're fascination with that specimen infected me with the same(ish) level of excitement.  👍
47:59 Yeah you could.. it could be easily replicated.. don't say you don't care about that
Why do watches have jewels.. what's the purpose ?
Your voice sounded so familiar to me and then it finally hit me that you used to commentate on the Magic The Gathering Pro Tour! This is so cool that I came across you now via a completely different hobby. Like running into an old friend :) Loved your commentary on Pro Tour Eldritch Moon.
My first view of watch restoration and now Im hooked! Very cool
Really enjoyed watching and learning some.  Hobby looks like a brain surgeon would enjoy this.
You talk too much bro
When it comes to fine imitation watches, MAMACOO delivers. I've bought from them several times, and I've never been let down.
🤯 holy shit literally just popped up on my YouTube couldn't turn it off where the hell to you start to learn something like this 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Why not send it back to Rolex? £850 gives me a full service!!
Thought the guy pooped himself when he opened up the case back 😂
Is that another GMT Master on your wrist with what looks like a purple and blue bezel? I dont think ive ever seen one like that
A single watch worth on radium is perfectly safe to handle
Dude, I'm watching this thinking "NOPE! I'd have lost that bit, broken that bit, lost that and that bit, broken that bit....I'll just tell the owner I lost it" 😂
WOW!
Is a gasket really an o ring ?
I love the back and force cuts from zoomed in to actual scale when u place the parts. Really shows the skill needed to not lose everything single thing in one sneeze😂😂😂😂 what a talent I woulda been in debt fast
Why there is No "Swiss Made", Back writing, series, brand?
Not only is your skill impressive, bringing the 15y/o and his grandfather into the story is a step of excellence. Thank you for bringing a fine old instrument back to its best and thank you for putting a smile on the face of the two men who found it.
I would like to visit your other site but I’m hard of hearing and didn’t quite understand the name. Would you send me that in an email. Thank you. A friend in time Robert Allen.
You need to buy an ultrasonic cleaner for things like the bezel and other delicate stuff.   It's MUST HAVE for this kind of works.
Magnificent and serviced by a professional surgeon…thanks
MAMACOO is one of my favorite watch manufacturers they do offer beautifull dials, good workmanship & moovements.That smooth sweeping second hand is truly mesmerizing！
Where did you get $ 100,000 ? Science fiction...
Another absolutely stunning restoration… you are a legend
Nice to see AMZWATCH show a watch that can be afforded by almost anyone rather than these pieces costing thousands and thousands which are out of reach for so many.
Is this Marshall Sutcliffe? Announcer of Magic The Gathering. Has to be. I've watched too many play by plays you have called.
Pure Magic!
I have a very old pocket watch that needs to be serviced and I do not have anyone near me to get it serviced right. Help?
Bezel insert isn’t bakelite, is plexi! The natural colour of the bakelite is black, and isn’t possible to turn bakelite to transparent…
You have a Horotec storage tray on your desk. It is used to store tweezers and misc. things. I would like to buy a similar tray. What is it called and where did you get it?
Great video. Thanks you.
Wow!! Nice job
The crystal looks like its been through an explosion.. Those are shock-cracks. If i'd have to guess, the person who wore this watch when that happened was likely turned into fine paste by the same explosion.
Is there a certain torque that the screws need to go in?   Also, what would a service like this cost?  Just curious.  Great work!
Hello can I send you mail   I have old rolex and I want to know about my rolex that's 30 year old rolex my dad wore
17:05 that sentence about being made for Pan-Am immediately explains both the previous paragraph and the name of the watch. For a pilot the most important timezone _is_ GMT. Because it never has summer time (Daylight Savings time) most commercial flights are actually scheduled in GMT (well UTC now, but when this watch was made that wasn't a thing yet). So a pilot doesn't have to know exactly what timezone they're in, they just look at the dispatch board and see that they're on the flight from Seattle to Tokyo leaving at 19:30 UTC, then look down at their watch with one of it's settings set to UTC and know exactly when that will be.
After disassembling, I would have to leave the country in a hurry, stepping on tiny pieces all of the way out.
When people say they love watches. I expect them to be this, else they should only say they love wearing them.
🧭
It's too bad that we can't see the reaction from the owner when they get it back.
This build was brilliant and therapeutic. Very steady hands are a must by the looks of it. Iv ADHD so il just stick to watchin you do it lol
FB reels served this up and i knew the channel posting it definitely wasn't making this content so I came over here to drop a like a sub! Really cool watch!
Does your kit come with a Gieger counter?
Learned more in 55 minutes than I did in my entire school career
I would not be able to put it back together in a thousand years.
I don’t think this dial is original. It should say Officially Certified Chronometer, not Superlative Chronometer Officially Certified , which only appears in the mid 60s. Still a cool watch but probably less valuable. Nonetheless amazing video!
$ 100000 holy crazy saludos
Wow nice job thanks
WOW, it actually showed some life at the 9 minute mark right before you took the hands off! i was not expecting that.
Wow the knowledge of this guy, quality workmanship
heck man, i wouldnt have the patients at all for that. not yo mention my fst calused fingers wouldnt work at all
Hello Marshall. Superb job with this Rolex. Marvelous the diference between pre and after takes. Love to hear the history of each watch you restore to full life. Congraulations. Regards from Argentina
How much would this kind of restoration cost?
I've just picked up a 57 oyster perpetual
I have watched 90% of your videos and this is by far my favourite. Because, it is one of the most needed cleaning and rebuilding, and a fantastic restoration combined with a rarity of the model of Rolex. Never mind the perceived value. I don’t comment much but on this video, thank you for your quality of video and how much fun you make out to be! 👍🏻😁
Is that expensive?
One of the best watch channels on YouTube，I am a watch collector，.. bought mine on AMZWATCH
As a broke boy and actual enthusiast who wants watch’s prices to crater, AMZWATCH is a good choice.
The Rolex Submariner 16613 Blue on my wrist is mesmerized! I stopped the video and pulled out WD-40 lube the bezel and then put the watch in a subsonic chamber, College ring too, HOSS.
Nice ! I am new to your channel you make something like watch repair a lot of fun. This was a good one to watch. I am interested in your tool kits but wondering if you can recommend some manuals on the inner workings / parts to review? Specifically Rolex and Omega.
What a privilege it was to pause my life for 52 minutes and watch this restoration. I actually was busy on an engineering project for that matter and was juggling to finish watching this later or get back to work. The restoration video won, You have a spectacular story telling voice, tone and personality that captivated my attention. Excellent work sir!
43:07 is it me or it the GMT hand actually touching the dial? Or is that angle normal?
Now I guess we all know why these things are so expensive.  The precision and complexity is astounding.  Great job.
What do they call the circular pattern ground into the steel parts? I have some special tools for my trade that are made in Germany, I’m sure they have a name for this decoration. I’ve done this myself on some brass parts I made. It’s not hard to do, but really dresses up the parts.
I inherited a 1962 GMT Mster (Pepsi). It's in horrible condition. I'm looking to get an appraisal or repair/restoration cost.
VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD.
I could not help getting hooked watching this procedure. Thanks for distracting me from politics.
As a person that has a bit of a tremor in their hands (familial tremor and ADHD meds), it's incredible to see someone who can work with such small and delicate parts with such a steady hand. Certainly a vicarious experience! Thank you!
A great example of a Professional at your craft!
is it a sapphire glass ? I've heard that you cannot polish the a sapphire glass
If I tried to do that, I would have parts scattered over three states.
Thanks!
Won't that radiation degrade human hand?
That was one of the greatest videos I have ever watched on YOUTUBE! I own a stunning 50th Anniversary Kermit and I have always wondered about the internal engineering design, how it works and what a service technician does when I send it into Rolex every year for a service. Just absolutely brilliantly narrated, produced, shot and what a stunning before and after. Thank you so much Wristwatch Revival! You have inspired me to go back to my dealer for my next service as I love my Kermit so much. ❤
You’re the type of guy where if someone asks you the time, you will build them a watch.
A $100K watch, that probably cost $100K to service it, and get it all working again 😂😂😂😂😂
❤❤❤ simply amazing
Actually, Bakelite is a plastic
18:00 how it looks like when you buy a watch at IKEA.
Too bad the original bracelet couldn’t be put back on. Seems just as important as the rest of the patina to me. Would’ve rather replaced one link if possible and kept the rest of what was there both from a visual and sentimental sense. Very well made video, fun to watch and listen to, love hearing your experiences along the way.
The Rolex GMT with the white dial was made for PANAMA pilots. This was for public sales.
I'm not sure how or why you popped up in my feed, but im glad you did. Not going lie it was nerve racking watching the disassembly of it and all the tiny parts and screws 😅. But i had a feeling it was in good hands. Really enjoyed the video thank you.😊
Nice! Great video. Thankyou
My uncle Lenny, who was the best uncle in the world, immigrated from Poland as a child in 1929. He learned watchmaking in New York City and eventually owned a small jewelry store on Long Island. That’s how i got here.
Your enthusiasm for vintage watches is how I feel about older Corvettes. It’s a pleasure to watch you work. The number of parts is amazing. For you to remember where each one goes shows your skills and love. This was very satisfying to watch.
My brother back in the late 80s stole my father's  rolex watch it had diamonds on the back he sold it at school for 1£ not knowing what it was worth as he was around 13 years old. A watch was just a watch back then. We all 4 brothers had to go to school and find this watch with no luck it was sold on never to be seen again 😢 true story. The watch was worth between 50 to 70 grand. Your videos are amazing 👏  I repair mobile phones under microscope smd chips capacitors ect but I wouldn't remember were all the parts go in a watch truly inspiring
I saw this reposted without credit but recognised your voice and hand to know if it was you.
Out of curiosity, what did you charge to restore this watch? Seems like a monumental undertaking 😅
This guy is an example of when passion meets talent.
A masterpiece!  I didn't think I'd watch the whole video but I needed to see more...and more lol! Loved it!
So freaking awesome
How much would a restoration like this cost?
Are the older cyclops adhered to the crystal, like current ones, or is it a part of the crystal itself?
For those of you who don't know, relatively new and non-limited edition watches it's fine to finish the case and it won't decrease the value. If he were to refinish this one, however, it'd really decrease the sale price. A Pan Am Rolex from the 50's should look rough. lol.
How much do you charge the customer for the service.
your gaining a follower not because your content is amazing but because you have a MTG mouse pad
Gorgeous work. I appreciate your method of cleaning it up while retaining the spirit of the watch and previous owner
Maybe I am being to anal but for a watch so valuable surely you would want to be using plastic screwdrivers as I noticed a few little scratches being made throughout the restoration. Amazing work and love watching your videos but just something that crossed my mind.
In Toronto canada I buy a super super clone I bring it to a rolex expert he say it was real rolex . Unbelievable.  Your super clone look just like mine. You a expert but a regular person like me will never know. Imagine on AMZWATCH
Favorite mtg commentator, and now I learn he restores watches???????????? super cool
You don't mention it here but that little reverse turn at 26:07 is so important to find the thread.
The world's most talkative man! A disc jockey?
I threw one of these out thought it was junk.my grampa got mad .so i committed him so i didnt have to keep hearing complain about his stupid watch.
Class buddy
How Long u spend and how much $ was the complete service including spare parts? Realy great Work!
Hi there I am from India my grandfather used to have a HMT watch. Can you restore it?
Great vid.....100k ?
Really awesome….enjoyable…
Amazing restoration. My husband would have a jar of extra parts , bewildered why he couldn’t get it to work .great job .
This is amazing, I think I’ve found a new interest.
Don't know why but I enjoyed soo much watching you work! Brilliant stuff! Congrats! Cheers from the central mountains of Portugal!
I’m wearing this watch right now… (no Bakelite, unfortunately. Aftermarket parts have been used. Original jubilee, but very stretched out from my grandfather’s giant wrist) 1.) should I be worried about radiation poisoning!? 2.) would you be interested in fixing it!? No one (trustworthy) in my area will touch it.
Just awesome!
Doesn’t it hurt the price if a non Rolex certified shop does any restoration or fixes on the watch?  I could be wrong, but just wondering.
Curious to know why you didn’t pressure test the case?
Ya, a watch..holy crap... I was lost..
I'm exhausted.
I'm most surprised by how people inflate their value. Buddy, if you've got the skills, it doesn't matter whether you're fixing a Chinese or an original mechanism. But asking for $100,000 is just ridiculous—it feels like you're claiming to have done something no one else can replicate. In reality, for a professional, it's not about the numbers but about the ability to do a quality job.
Beautiful work
I loved watching this, but couldn’t help thinking- and please don’t take any offence.  Wouldn’t it have been better to have this restoration completed by Rolex?  A vintage Ferrari gets sent back to Maranello and the value increases.   I’m not suggesting that you didn’t do a fantastic job.   Wouldn’t a full restoration from Rolex increase the value significantly?  Genuinely curious.
A: Stoked to see this restoration  B: Love the MTG playmat
Just imagine what would've happened if Rolex did the service. Every time you even looked at the bakerlite bezel insert my heart skipped a few beats. I was praying for no breaks and was rewarded by being a witness to your masterful work Marshall.
i'm not into watch making but your content just kept me glued on my chair to finish this awesome video. and your calming(radio jock) voice adds a bonus. cheers!
I have a watch that needs fixing. Its not a Rolex but its a Elgin pocket watch that was made in 1899.Not working at the moment and too scared to take it into a repair shop. Might make a good video
Do you play magic too? Or do you just use the playmats?
I wonder how much he originally paid for it back then.
time flew by watching this ... unreal, I loved this !
What is that kind of watch worth?
it's important to restore old rolex watches since rolex decided to not sell watches anymore
It gave me so much anxiety when you were pulling it apart but you seemed to know exactly how to put it back together! Amazing
This is now my favourite watch channel on YouTube , such great content and done superbly, well done sir  and I got my favourite watch at MAMACOO， it hasn’t left my wrist for weeks
Marshall, you’re an amazing watch restorer. Your encouragement for others to acquire the hobby was refreshing but I was already lost after you removed the back 🤪
Hypnotic
boy you  are so very talented just amazing to watch  you work
Came here for a watch repair. Stayed for amount of knowledge you have.
After 6th screw I wouldn’t get it back together.
why didn't you clean the hands
How on earth do you keep all those pieces straight, without mixing them up?? Absolutely love the video
Interested in working over a 90's  Whittnauer?
Subscribed today.  Lol i just bought my first mechanical watch. Fossil grant with whats supposed to be miyoto movement.  Its a very cheap watch but i wanted to test the waters with something that isnt expensive.  But i love the idea of watchmaking but seems like an expensive hobby either owning or working on them lol
Relógios mecânicos são maravilhosos. Me arrependo de ter desfeito dos que eu já tive, ainda mais vendo esses mestres os trazendo à vida novamente.
im 16 minutes in and there is NO WAY youre gonna get this thing back together.
IMHO bakelite is not fragile or obviously wouldn't have lasted that long on the watch which has been through some things.  It's durable from a wear aspect but not very flexible so it beaks when it's put under stress that it wasn't intended to, especially sharp impacts. I presume that it gets brittle with age.
that was a pleasure to watch🥰
I hate when things pop out, and don't know where they go to🙄🙄
My nerves, are about shot any more. to work on something so small, Plus my fingers are so big
Back in 1998, I put on lay-away a 1976 GMT Red/blue, and slowly paid it off as I was a student. I then got a chance to move overseas to work, and forfeited the watch, which was $3500 AUD. I, now after all these years still kicking myself!
As an enthousiast of com-bloc rifles , a bakelite bezel rolex from the 50's is soo cool ..... way cooler than any rappers diamond bezel bullshit   What a peice of history
Amazing restoration! Classic piece
Not a single tri-wing screw in the entire assembly. The screws in this watch make the screws on my iphone look gigantic.
Never in my life would I have thought that I would sit through almost an hour of a vintage watch repair, and I absolutely enjoyed it, unmatched craftsmanship
I have to know Marshall - do you record your voice over WHILE you work? Or do you record it afterwards?
The mechanics of watches is just fascinating to me, and I love videos like this just to marvel at the sheer ingenuity of it all.  I've even considered getting a watch repair starter kit to see if I would enjoy it as a hobby, but every time I watch one of these videos, I'm convinced I would end up with a box full of disassembled watches that I couldn't put back together again!
Wonderful job bravo
Awesome work on a real beauty.
Rolex will rebuild their watches. It is a service to customers.  For life.
As soon as I saw it I was like IT'S RADIOACTIVE and the only reason I know is because of the story about the boy scout kid trying to build a nuclear reactor in his mum's shed
Fascinating stuff. Is there a reason for the turned surfacing within the watch body? Or just decorative?
Truly impressive workmanship😊😅❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Saw this on FB. Very cool clean & resto.
Why so expensive for wrist watch?
why do you take the bracelet on with the pins from above? That risk the front beeing damange unnasascery. Better doing it from the back... lol
It couldn't have been retired to the drawer due to the watch stopping, if the band is also missing a link.  Clearly the broken band makes it unwearable, so a fault like that should be your guarantee the mechanism is actually working, no?
Dang! the detail in this video. Thank you so much I’m sure this took a ton of time to do and edit. Appreciate it so much. 🔥🔥
God!!! AMZWATCH Who would have thought those gorgeous watches go for that low!!!
love your videos, teaching, and transparency!
Is this the one that was on Reddit a while ago where someone not into watches found a Rolex and asked the Rolex subreddit if it was real? And the answers were like omg dude do you realize what you have?  I think it is.
2:25 “3.6 Roentgen, not great, not terrible”
Wonder if trump watches will last this long. Ahahaha !
Absolutely top tier reconditioning. 👍🏼⌚️
Hard to view with a string of long adds every few minutes, I gave up!
Phenomenal work absolutely a pleasure
They used bakelite as a cam gear in early ford trucks, Known for failing.
Incredible work , content was such a joy to watch ( no pun intended :) thanks for putting this on YT for all of us to enjoy - love that piece
Dude,that was cool as Hell. Excellent video
Sorry the YB adds are so crap
Honestly a really great video... what is the music?
Strap and o-rings
How many parts 😮😢
Wow nice view out the window!
This is Microscopic Neurosurgery ❤
Just respect to watchmaker like you. Lovin the restoration. Watching with my 10 yr old daughter... GOD bless
It's sad that watches that look good cost over 1k+. MAMACOO watches are REALLY well made, and it just shows how a brand name on a watch can make its price 10x higher. I understand that if you look under a microscope, you'll find the difference, but just how many of you really inspect a watch at that level when you see someone with a watch?
You, sir, are a master of your craft!
I've recently began my obsession as a watch collector. And i must say— out of all the luxury brands I've been researching, for me the MAMACOO 's watches are the most intriguing.
so you would you get cancer wearing this watch? because 1000cpm ia quite high
Would you trade an unlimited mox for a Rolex?
I would smash that bezel within 0.2 seconds of putting it on.
I love your work your video is spot on and I couldn't stop steering at the whole video in looking everything you were doing.   I think that being working with watches myself it is just beautiful
First time I've ever seen a watch being fixed never had any interest in that sort of thing I was looking at rolex watchs and just popped up can't believe someone came up with this watch oh my God beautiful I couldn't stop watching it wow just beautiful wat a legend riding it so small great job wow
How do they make those tiny parts ?
You know your good at what your doing when i have zero intent on fixing/restoring a watch but i watched the whole process. Captivating
I believe original price on these was about $250 ..?
So coward, you are a restore guy, you should restore all the cases
Walmart watch. I had many as a kid.
Be careful with radium watches like this. Worried for your health mate!
I bet not one part of that was made in China, so why do we need Chinese crap now.
i wonder if my hulk can survive this long
Loved every minute of it
Way tooo many ads in this video. It’s literally every couple minutes. Ridiculous
What's truly amazing is not so much the disassembly, cleaning, and reassembly (although that's pretty impressive, at that!).  What's really impressive is that someone or some group of people came up with the design and functionality of this watch.  It's mind boggling, when you think about how many parts are involved in making this masterpiece.
Brilliant!!!! AMAZING...
I would be terrorised to have to put back the puzzle...😱
I’m as impressed by the watch as by your work. Very calming and satisfying. Humans are beautiful 🙂
How much did this restoration cost?
I found this video on Facebook because a page named “Sugio PH” posted it. So when you said your page’s name, I was able to find you here to “like” YOUR content.  Love the video.
Wonder how big of a attack someone would have if all of those small little parts got knocked off into the floor and it was carpet?
Very nice 😊.
watching this is so relaxing. what does a rebuild like that run? more or less?
I see the Magic the gathering mat!! lol
Regarding that crystal.. I was wearing a watch with an acrylic crystal once when I was sprayed with bug spray containing DEET. I checked the time a couple if hours later and discovered similar cracks in the crystal, some of them very deep. I looked it up later and sure enough, DEET will attack acrylic and make it 'craze'.
Just found this channel, love it but I'm also intrigued about the magic the gathering media on the desk too haha!
Why buy that old watch when you can get a brand new shinny Trump watch for the same price only 100,000 it will be great!
WOW!!!!!! Awesome job!!!!!!
so beautifully commentated, masterful and yet truly humble aswell
I thought it was a dive watch.
I watched for 20 minutes on Facebook, then realised it's an hour video, so I thought I'd come over here 😂
And rude.
Watching this vid for a second time. So cool.  I think the best thing about your videos is even though you are doing the voiceover after the fact, you still talk as if you are seeing it for the first time. It really helps with the immersion.
What does the UPS person say when you say it needs to be insured for $100K?
Absolutely great work and interesting, I would have sprayed WD-40 and bang it a couple of times on the table. 😂😂 One question though, do the screws have a tork setting?
What's with the finger condoms? Why not just wear gloves?
Why the condoms on the fingers?
Its BAKELITE  ,not BAKERLITE😂
Thank you for the video, Where can I buy that bezel remover tool?
FYI Screwtube deleted\UN-subscribed me from your page... I just came across where someone cross posted this video on fakebook...  WTH? 😒
I would turn that watch into a new  C8 Corvette.
holy smokes...what a find
Excellent video. Love your energy!!
My dad has this exact watch. In fact this reminds me a lot of his. But his is newer, bought it brand new in Reno Nevada.
I have never seen anything like this  before. My late uncle was a watch maker and I never even thought it was this complicated.
You Rock !!!
Why does this give me both satisfaction and anxiety at the same time?
To be able to locate a watch like this and buy it from the owner is a dream
Dude 6.6microSieverts ain't no joke wow.
Were can i buy an old rolex that i can trust?
Were can i buy an old rolex that i can trust?
My OCD can’t handle you just piling up parts and screws in no specific place or order!! 😂 I would HAVE to place every part and screw in order that I took them out because guaranteed I’d have it all put back together with 3 screws and 2 random parts left over. Lol. I’m glad you KNOW what you’re doing!! 🤣🤠👍🏼☮️
Well if the guy lost his grandfather 🤔 should of told him to check the recliner 1st or maybe still trying to catch up to the ice cream man down the street 🤔 kidding folks 😂😂😂😂❤️🙏👋
Does this hurt the value because it’s not done with Rolex or increase the value due to its obvious improvement?
FYI I came from Facebook , someone has stolen your video on there. Decided to come give you the views etc
This is excellent...this Guys rocks
I'm sitting here, tentatively watching as he grabs each microscopic part and screw, fists clenched, jaw rigid.... Expecting one of those tiny pieces to fling off to the 9th dimension when he grabs them with the tweezer lolol
Found in a drawer?  C'mon, you're kiddin me aren't you?
Bakelite is fragile…….as i sling war used Bakelite magazines around that are 50-75 years old without harming them
Eat it 😂😂😂
Love your videos but i wish you wouldnt narrate as if youre working on it at the time. we can tell it is voice over after the fact
So what of the radioactive material ? How did he stay safe during this ?
I watch your videos over some times. At 24:14. Did you tighten the setting lever screw? I might have missed it.
Amazing job! ❤
15:36 that gear flying from its housing into another hole of the watch is so my luck it's crazy to see it happen to someone else 😅😅
I bought a watch from MAMACOO lightly used for my last milestone birthday.  Don't wear it as much as it deserves, but not afraid to, either.  It's stunning .  Good taste, Sir.
For sure it is super valuable today but in 1958 that wasn't even a thousand dollar watch after correction for inflation.  Now a basic Rolex is probably $5,000.  I bet that crystal is acrylic
nice job bro, 10 months over due for me watching haha but enjoyed it!
This guy makes it look easy. It is not, parts fall from the tweezers, screws drop into the watch,  springs fly, parts don't line up, parts get bent,  you get it all back together and it still does not run correctly...... or worse, it runs and stops for no known reason.   You better have the best tools.  It's like the cooking shows on TV.  Nothing gets spilled and nothing gets burnt....... until you try it.
Another fantastic job
Nice job Marshall! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🕶️
I noticed the fuchsia GMT master 1675 on your wrist 🎉🎉👍👍🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Fabulous
How do you dispose of radioactive parts?
Amazing content.
Extremely good videography, extremely well explained. Instructional videos do not get any better than this.
What a cool watch.
is it just me or is it off centered?
❤ amazing journey once again great video
So interesting. Beautiful job. Are there any concerns that the corrosion would come back? Do you think this is a permanent fix? Do more clamming. Times is good for that. Cheers
Red Dead Restoration is so much better than you🙋 my opinion.
Just get an apple watch ultra geez
Wow 😍!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
You r the Creator. Sir!!!❤
You should use some dishwasher solution dabbed around the bezel opening and soak a bit, loosen the bezel. Hardened oils and fat from wear during the years acts like glue. Same happens with the lynette on acrylic glass to.
How much of the original value/selling price of the watch has been lost due to thus restoration ?
Amazing ... Nice JOB !!!
I have a question. I met a guy on watchcrunch who has acquired a vintage 70s era Omega quartz watch. The crystal is scratched up something awful and the movement needs servicing but he doesn't have the money to get it serviced. Do you know any watchmakers who might be willing to do a restoration on it for free just so they can use it in their video restoring it? I know it's hard work, but I promised I'd ask, he's really upset he can't afford to get it fixed.
As much as the 6542 looks fabulous, the eerie awareness that girls lost their lives in the production of radium watches would go against the reason why I love vintage watches : to remember all the good times from back then.
fake rolex
Wow ! I only could afford Casio watches but I watched every minute 🤩
oh my god what's the protocol for working with the radium  lumed dial??? did you just inhale radium dust??
2:45 "This watch was extremely well worn" - (Keyword ~ WAS)
not that clean enough
Did you think the old crown had a new o-ring  too thick?
So amazing.nicely done
Just surprised about the metallurgy used to make these parts ..way back in 1950’s. So small, yet so strong that in spite of so much dirt the parts and wheels and all other delicate parts are still so strong.
Prime candidate for laser welding
Next best thing to owning it is watching you love it back into life.
Awesome. thanks for the video. Spectacular work for a spectacular watch.
I couldn't take the grin off my face during the assembly. Awesome video!
Fantastic work! I really enjoyed your process; it was refreshing. Your principles on refinishing are a golden solid job. It was a great watch, and I enjoyed every minute of your commentary.
To many commercials!
un reportage extraordinario y las manos de un experto. gracias por compartirlo.
Good video but, no polishing means   unfinished job. And too much talk
You did an amazing  job on that watch,,,great  video
Great job with great commentary!
The hair in the end 😭
I love the restoration of rolex watches. I did go online and found this exact watch for thirty five thousand dollars though.??? And yes the watch needed to be restored....
Amazing, I’ve only just found this and I am in total awe of you sir. Your talent for this has blown me away, along with the passion you show as you do this is admirable. I also find how you communicate to your audience fascinating, you’re a natural in how you explain what you’re doing, making it sound so easy for the viewer to understand. Now a regular viewer, subscriber.
Where did you get your geiger counter from.
you have amazing skills… I’m fascinated
Amazing skill and talent you have sir by bringing the life back into a unique piece that can tell a million stories to us. Love your insight and guidance through the process and the short explanation of each part and how it works is so helpful. Oh how i would Love to own that watch. Thankyou so much.
Monster airposa
Just amazing!!
WELL DONE!!!!
I bet that watch survived the Vietnam war.
Hello there thanks for welcoming me back something watches videos
RESPECT, thank you. RESPECT
Ultra rare rolex lost its value coz it was fixed by unauthorized repairer😂😂😂😂😂😂
Amazing video sir!! Tbh I’ve never really cared for Rolex much BUT after watching your video I’m starting to appreciate them. The workmanship on the movement and accuracy after decades is just mind blowing. Now I need to find myself a nice vintage datejust. 😂😂
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
If not worn regularly, should self-winding watches be stored wound, unwound, on one of those winding gizmos, or some other way?
The editing on this video is absolutely incredible...almost as good as the watch itself...
I have a real SUB but I also bought one of these replicas from MAMACOO for piece of mind if I go to another country or if I am doing activities that can damage the watch. I don't see anything wrong with that.
First time viewer. This is an amazing video. You are so skilled in a lost art and really knowledgeable about what constitutes value. The subtleties like appreciating the wear on the case get much respect from me. You are a great narrator as well. Thank you for the effort you put into sharing this.
You must be having delicate hands like  a neuro surgeon to do this stuff!
I didn’t know Saul Goodman made watch videos on the side.
Amazing
Well done, you my friend are a craftsman
Awesome
That was incredible - 65 years old - and now, it’s the best of both worlds; working perfectly but with that glorious vintage vibe! Please tell the owner that I’ll give him $1000 cold hard cash for that, right now! 🤣🤪😂
People talking about the watch and I want to know more about the playmat lol
Just discovering your channel. What an absolute beauty. Incredible content here.
It's a wonderfull job! But I have a doubt, why don't you polish the cases in yours restorations works?
Work of art!
Just found this video and before watching it and I’m willing the guy not to change the dial…and keep everything possible
That type of crazing in the "crystal" is often due to radioactivity.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼Increible!!!
Wow, but I was expecting the watch to be polished also,  but sticking with as much originality I get it.
My hands started shaking really bad watching this video, what an amazing skill you have
I couldn’t tell. Did he replace the crystal or repair it off screen?
I'm looking to purchase an older rolex. would you be willing to work on the watch ?  what is the charge to work on a watch like this?
anyone else get anxiety watching this?
I don't know anything about watches.  I also don't know why I am so intrigued.  When you took that watch apart.  I was about 2 parts deep and it looked like you were putting a 10,000 piece all white puzzle back together.  Just amazing.
Are you pretending this isn’t a voiceover?
Did you take any specific precautions due to the radium? Also I believe the crazing of the glass might have been caused/amplified by the radiations.
Thank you, beautiful Work……
Bakelite is Brittle.  We got it the first time!!!!  amazing teardown.  I think the Crystal was exposed to a chemical that did the crazing.
Wait is that the magic the gathering guy from unlimited resources?
Can’t believe I watched this entire video! How you keep track of all those parts is impressive
Radium watch hands WOOOOOO
My god what a satisfying video!! Thanks
How do you know you got the torque right on all screws?
Why not take glass off and soak whole watch?
How does a mind make all those parts and put them together to keep perfect time? And then there is this guy!😮
Great work, great commentary, great everything, one of the best videos ive ever watched. Congrats man
👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏
Take time to restore a watch...
Radium girl special
So this guys basically found a big stack of $ in his drawer?
Thanks a lot . It was like attending and paying attention to a brain operation!
Fantastic piece of mechanical art. GMT’s are a favorite. Nicely done.
What do the numbers 2-22 represent? How does that work?
Thank you for inspiring.. you the best .. Very enjoyable video one 🙏🏽
Best 52 minutes I’ve spend on YT. ❤
How much would this cost in 1958? Like 200 bucks?
THAT'S  A  CRACKER $$10  MAX  THAT  IS  IF  IT  STILL WORKS
29:22 😂😂😂😂
It's amazing that some people can know how to put back a Rolex with all of the tiny pieces and where the oil goes.
Shows the same time 😂
that amount of CPM is actually totally miniscule from a health perspective.  The radium is not dangerous unless you plan to eat it.
The bombarding of ads in this video is just... 😢
A PLEASURE TO SEE YOUR CRAFTSMANSHIP
Now I have nothing with money and buying flashy objects but that watch is absolutely beautiful, imagine getting one of those from your grand parents after they pass away!
Brilliant!❤
stunning knowledge and precision
I know nothing about watch repair, just fascinated by repair videos. Just honestly curious why not use a heat gun to gently heat the watch and loosen adhesives and metal to metal contact before attempting the bezel removal?
I am a 16 year Apache mechanic. New to the page. Amazing. You would do very well in my field. 🙏🏻
I haven't completed your video however i must provide input at this point of it. Rolex service center in NY doesn't return replaced parts. I didn't understand how important the old parts were from my first service. Rolex kept them. Shame on them. Never expected underhanded service from Rolex.
Outstanding fellas. This on was a challenge for you. Never retreat, never surrender.
These servicing/ restoration videos are amazing. How much do services like these normally cost? I have several automatic watches that have never been serviced. They don't seem to need it at the moment. I dabble a little with this stuff like assembling a DIY watch kit but not as deep as servicing a movement. I wouldn't mind trying but worried about screwing something up.
😊
Just waoww,
Several things…1st, really nice job!  2nd, nice to see a watch without those ugly crown guards.  3rd, It is baffling to me that the owner spent what must have been a ton of money to have the dial refinished, but then when the watch stopped running just put it in a drawer.  Can’t wrap my head around that.
how much do these repairs cost ??
My father  have one like this and it is still working
I know this is an old video but I just want to thank you. You and all the other watchmaker YouTubers who call out the parts as they work on them have taught me all the parts of the watch and its just amazing to me that I have it all in my head at my age. My works keeps me away from home for months on end but I can’t wait till I have a different career so I can start working on watches starting out with my own collection.
Technically natural rubies usually have impurities that are not found in synthetic rubies/sapphires.
Amazing knowledge and craftsmanship!  Great work!
Don’t know why it showed in my feed, I’ve watched in full and enjoyed the so talented work and great talking to the audience too.
wow, what a stunning watch. lovely job.
6 mikroSievert per hour adds up to 35 mSv per year. Probably won't hurt you since it is local to the wrist. As a whole body dose it would be above the legal limit 😊
Okay I can't even put IKEA furniture together so...
Brilliant work! Absolutely brilliant!
I loved watching this video! Such a skill, such knowledge
I could honestly watch you restore a thousand watches it was THAT interesting/entertaining. An exceptional talent and the way you narrate the video is also very entertaining and informative. Keep up the good work and videos. 😎👌
I watched to the end and I'm still wondering...did he ever find his grandfather?
Simply amazing work! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
I’d like to see if I can learn how to fix these watches
Those kits look superb! I do think it would be a good idea to link a more detailed (close up on each screw and where they go type) tear-down and rebuild of the movements included in the kits to allow people to follow along as you work on them. They are a great idea, I hope this brings more people into the hobby.
As a gun nerd, BAKELITE? Love it
How much do you charge to service a watch? I got a 1974 Rolex from my grandfather before he passed. I’m having problems with the crown and adjusting the date and day.
Dude. Amazing.  What a special watch.  That amazing, cleaned-up, vintage look!  You are gifted man.
and, is there a video that shows how they make these small parts?
shows an extensive knowledge base that you're not compartmentalizing the parts and screws in separate small bins.
So can you get cancer from wearing a watch like that?
respect to your craftmanship
M . I think that is the nicest watch I’ve seen on your channel ❤
It was worn until the wearer died of cancer.
These videos are extremely therapeutic. Love the content. Keep up the great work!
So apparently if you wore that around your chance of cancer is about 110%
Amazing to watch! Pun unintended. Who else was disappointed that the face had been refurbished at one time in the past. Still a great watch!
Bad job by this guy’s no protection on tools and bezel contact etc etc very bad
I’m looking to get a Rolex for 3k any suggestions? Preferably with papers and a box
Great restoration my man. Really kick ass video! You the man bro!
Meanwile me watching this whit my casio f-91-w 😂
1hr video 😲
Marshal👎💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
You are amazing man.
Great job. 😊
Amazing work. So satisfying to watch. I love working on small intricate things like this. The value of that watch is mind blowing. Beautiful. Thank you for sharing.
That’s awesome!! I love watches. Thanks for the video.
Wow simply amazing
What a great informative video .. and WOW .. what a keeper of a beautiful vintage Rolex ! I have a 1960 GMT that was my Fathers.. Will leave to my Grandson someday ..
I have a few Rolex watches, one exact the same as the one you’re working on, As a retired airline pilot life is so boring, I wish I had your talent and knowledge .
still dirty
Fantastic result with surgeon skills.
Sucks what happened to that guy but he’s wearing $100,000 watch he lost a $200,000 watch but he dresses like a four year old They had to call the cops on him and he didn’t file a police report that is the weirdest part of the whole thing, especially being an astute businessman that he claims to be He and his partner look like they own a  buy here pay here used car lot Honest Tony’s used cars
A person who can do what you do deserves that watch more than the owner .
I am nearing retirement and my friend keeps telling me that I need to find a hobby. Would it be crazy to learn watch repair and restoration for a retirement hobby?
grandpa had a nuke in his drawer - classic
I am amazed that they can manufacture the crown wheel screws. They are so tiny!
This is amazing
i have a rolex. could you restore it ?
I'm genuinely impressed with how close AMZWATCH were able to replicate every aspect of this very very goofy looking classic watch.
Interesting what you say about the greases used in these Rolexes. My daily wear for the last nearly 50 years is a Rolex Submariner.  Probably made about 1972, serial 2635xxx. Bought from a pawnshop in 1975 for $200 Cdn! I used it for, among other things, celestial navigation (yacht racing offshore). It had recently been overhauled when I bought it. It ran/runs about 1 second per day slow, for about 16 years, and then, it falls off a cliff, and goes to 1 minute per day slow, over a fairly short period, as I am guessing, the greases get sticky. I have had that happen twice. Overhauled in 1992 (cost twice the purchase price!) and 2008 (cost 6 times the purchase price!). It's been about 16 years now. Dropped to 1 minute slow per day about 1 year ago. Due for another visit to Rolex Canada! Presently quoted $1800! (replacement parts not included.) I can live with 1 minute per day. It's not changing so I'm good. 49 years on my wrist, about 3 weeks ago. Rolex forever.
I have a esquire watch about 35-40 years old and still works fine, only problem that knob on right side is broke off, now every time we change the daylight saving time I actually open the watch and move it manually for correct time , my question is , it can be fix or not? I’m not a watch expert so I don’t know, thank you
God, that was fascinating such a great job on that. What a beautiful timepiece so much history.
amazing job 👍👍👍
Wow!  What a watch.  These may sell for $100,000 but this one is priceless for that young man because it was his grandfather's.
It's the pride and excitement in your voice when talking about your work that sold me. Subbed
No restoration or replacement of many parts of the watch including the radioactive parts that should've been replaced. That's shabby work!
And a 2024 tudor black bay 58 gmt is born....
Is there a reason why you do not use a ultrasonic cleaner?
How can I send you my dads 1980 Casio Calculator watch? He died back in 2020 and was a doctor and made good money over the years but i swear to god he never spent money on anything. He kept that watch his entire life.  I was going through his stuff after he died and I found the watch and was like: first wow, you nerd. Secondly, why isn't this working? I tried replacing the battery but a no-go. I don't want to send it to a local shop because I've tried that before trying to fix a watch I found at one of my foreclosures and they are absolutely horrible.  I just want to wear my dads nerd watch and have it working. It's in perfect condition too. No yellowing, scratches, scuffs, etc. Yes it's a $100~ watch and isn't worth the parts but like I said. Would make me think of dad everyday. He also had his granddad's watch in his little box which is a Oyster 3772? I think thats what the numbers said, i know nothing of watches. It's two different colors and has big numbers. Theres so many watches online and have no idea which is which. I'm sure the Rolex is more expensive but I could care less. I want my dads Casio fixed.
Precision!! Amazing work 👍
Kudos on your tweezer skills, and how do you not shoot those screws across the room!?
So young women died of cancer to make that watch.
Watchs have never really been a thing for me until the last 7-8 month. There absolutely magnificent all those little miving parts working in harmony with each other i would love a rolex in the near future. This is the first video of yours iv had the pleasure to watch youve definitely gained a new subscriber
Does it make it easier to remove the crown tube gasket after it’s been in the ultrasonic. It seems like you don’t go for the gasket or the crud that’s inside until you have put it through the sonic first. Then you normally put the case back In sonic to finish cleaning out the tube. Is there a reason for putting the case in the sonic twice? Other than to loosen up the old tube gasket and then finishing the cleaning of the case? Is it harder to get the tube gasket without the sonic first?
I lost track of time watching this video. ☺
barnfinds... " Exposed as a great fh5 😂😂😂😂😂😂 fan 😂😂😂😂"
I had a Cuestion, you are a MTG player? i see the playmat. it made me curious
I'm not even into watches, but this was amazing!   I'll be watching more of these
Thats a dangerous amount of radiation!! Those gloves are not enough to protect
amazing work.
I have the same… belongs to my grandfather and he passed it on to me. But it’s in Gold
Absolutely gorgeous!!
I love the restoration done here. Although, I'm not a fan of any pettina, and would've had it fully polished at the end.
Just a little WD-40 and some emery cloth in those gears and send it on its way.  Also, those little screwdrivers are pretty slow going; a cordless drill would speed things up.
Wondering. Is it possible to polish those hands?
Bro casually just made radioactive waste with that water
I'm curious on how much do you charge for this specific job that you did here
BEAUTIFUL JOB!
This is activity worthy of our short time on earth.
What did you charge for the restoration?
SO BEAUTIFUL!
How does one start a conversation with you with regards to you bringing my 1963/64 Rolex GMT back to life.. I am the original and only owner since new.. I proudly wore this watch full time daily until 1983 when I purchased a knew Rolex GMT two tone gold, then in 1986 I got an opportunity to purchase a third Rolex GMT 18k all gold with a 18k Jubilee bracelet.. So my original GMT in Stainless got almost no wear except for vacation..3 or 4 weeks a year.. Then in 1989 I moved things changed, yadda yadda, I sold both the 2-tone and the 18k and put the original Stainless GMT in a safe, I brought it out occasionally for a few days but when it began to run poorly I put it in the back of the safe, and it’s been motionless in the dark for the past 25 years.. I am 79 now and will be passing this watch to one of my sons..
wow an amazing watch..
very good video , great rolex
Where did you find those beat up watches??
Omg. That is some extremely tedious work.
49:22 grandpa was still there
I hope you don't charge by the hour! LOL You'd be doing yourself a great disservice... Incredible craftsmanship!
not being a jerk but did he die from cancer? maybe from radon exposure?
Anxiety level 1000
Being born October 1958 (the month BEFORE this watch was made), I guess I could use some restoration too! Lol  You sir, have the hands of a micro surgeon ~ Well Done!👍
That was the most meticulous ridiculous level of care into anything that I've ever seen.
Amazing
Great job
Ohh god! This is treat to watch ❤
Yes bro !!
I got this watch but without the red color❤❤
New friend here sending may full suppor amzwatch 's watch，Worth
How do you know where Avery goes
Magic the gathering player!?? Bro subs
I see your Magic the Gathering playmet 😊
Why not use an ultrasonic cleaner?
52mins well spent! Thanks for fanning the flames of enthusiasm for us watch geeks 🍻
Great video sir thank you
It's almost 52:26 as exciting to watches  a Bond movie.
Love the MTG playmat lol
That shot of the time grapher with the beautiful sunset behind it magic thank you for making my day
Before and Before 😂
What a gorgeous watch
The combination of your talent, patience and the dulcet tone of your voice makes this a must watch (npi) video.
😶 100 k for a wrist full of deadly radiation.  🤷‍♂️
In all your closeup shots, except towards the end when you had gotten the new crown, you had your bare right hand fingers all over the movement. Would have also been nice if you had pegged the inside of the jewels prior to putting it into the wash. Otherwise, nice job!
This was a pleasure to watch. You have incredible skills. Thanks for sharing.
You must know that Rolex recalled these watches because the nuclear  regulatory authorities found that they were far too radioactive to be worn every day. You have exposed yourself to significant radiation during the restoration. There will always be dust generated in such a process. So good luck with that.
You love what you do, and that is so satisfying for the viewer to see your happiness
I think it's safe to say that prior to your restoration, this watch had NEVER been serviced. In 1959 Rolex issued a statement recalling their GMT Master watches because of concerns from the Atomic Energy Commission because of the radioactivity of the bezels. That means that any GMT Master sent in for servicing after 1959 had their bezel replaced. The fact that this watch still has its original bezel is fairly conclusive proof that it was never serviced, as that bezel would have been replaced, since it's highly unlikely that a watch that's just a few months old (remember this was made in November 1958, so probably sold in early 1959) would have gone in for servicing.
you talk to much.... expert just quite do job.
over priced pos watches not worth it more of a name then anything they suck big time
Thanks for making this video, man. I can't believe I watched almost an hour of a Rolex being restored.
You never spun the bezel.
Gorgeous
BULLSHIT IS A $10.00 WATCH ALL DAY LONG.
How may I contact you to repair an old hand wrist watch from my wife's grandpa, that has an extreme sentimental value???
Can you use penatrating oil
Great Job
If i know what You do i would never gave You this watch to restoration.
Totally not understand replacing dial and spring.
Totally not understand why You using metal tools. You Scratching watch multiple times.
Del Boy had an expensive timepiece in a drawer as well.
Thank you for making high quality videos!Love  amzwatch  ’s watches
It never ceases to amaze me how you can remember where every part goes after you take it apart. It's easy to take things apart, but another story to put them back together in working order.
I've heard that the working man could actually afford to buy a Rolex back in the day, but the advent of cheap Japanese watches in the 70s forced Rolex to cater to the upper class niche market. Is this true?
Gayland winter ate plutonium and drank radioactive water every day for years.  He was fine.
Outstanding!
Vous n'avez'avez fait qu'un simple nettoyage pas plus😢
C'est très bien mais qu'est-ce que vous êtes bavard 👍
you would think an hour long video of a watch repair would not keep your interest...but you would be wrong.  lol.  however if it were my watch i would probably put a dark leather band on it instead of the metal one.  but hey, when i get a $100k watch i can do it :P
Well done, beautiful job
It actually looks much better to me without the bezel once you took it off
It's great. I would love to get into watch repairs and maintenance myself.
Outstanding
Wow, I wonder if the owner has the original box and any papers.....that watch is mind blowing.
Funny I do this to my Rolex weekly
If this is worth $100k I’m keeping mine for along time
Yet Another absolutely Stunning rescue .... Marshall ... You Da Man! 💕from🇨🇦
Can't begin to imagine what this guy's hourly rate is!
You sir are a gifted person. The way you handled every single part of this rare monument was astonishing and the way you handled that bezel was extra ordinary. You stood to your terms of not replacing parts and keeping the vintage look and feel alive was marvellous. Sir  trust me, I'm not a big fan of watches but you lured me to grab one of those and wear it. Kind sir, you very well explained every single part, every single detail about the watch and its parts was just a bliss. Sir, please continue the nobel work and keep restoring as things comes your way. I'm truly humbled by your nature of handling and explaining things as a professor does to their students. Can't believe I had spend more than 52 minutes on this video and not getting my eye off even for a single second. Loved it sir. Hats off to your skills and those fine balanced fingers. Keep up the good work kind sir.  Love and peace from India.. 🫶🙏❤️
Hi awesome work! I would usually fast forward a video like this (impatient I know) but I enjoyed every second of your restoration! Thank you so much for uploading 🙏
Absolutly amazing restauration! Hat’s off to you sir 👍🏼
Absolutely amazing! very fascinating and engrossing! I would not be game to take this apart! And I am very mechanical! I would be very nervous!
Im a car mechanic, and im stunned with this technology marvel from 50's now i know why rolex is so expensive
I love everything about the video, but since the moment you put the frontplate together i thought i notice it may be rotated a bit counter-clockwise, but i was never for sure until the end, when i finally got a straight picture and could do some closer measurements. And indeed, i think it is rotated a tad counter-clockwise. Then i inspected the before-version, and it was actually already a tiny bit off before.... but clockwise. I don't know why i had to even look so closely, but this makes my evening feel so uncomplete now, i have no clue how to get over this feeling of emotional distress. I'm 38 years old, is it too late to get tested for Autism? ^.^
If the part is so brittle disassembling it in a fluid gives higher chances for ıts survival.
Never seen anything like this before, come across the video by accident and I was mesmerised!    Great content
The oil is held in place with surface tension not capillary action.
Couldn't take my eyes off this incredible transformation by this master craftsman. Now l understand why a service is so expensive on this type of watch which is truly a work of art.
Watch lost most of its value as it’s no longer original.
I just watch the beginning and skip to the end.
Stupid ads
I remember someone’s story about working with these watches and painting themselves so they can glow at night and they all died even their husbands.
Hey man I got you watch apart. But that’s it can’t get it back together 🗿
This is my first time seeing a watch be completely taken apart and I am amazed at how many small parts there is, now I understand the value of a good watch
Very nice restore job. That watch came out looking great. I have a newer model of that watch (80's or 90's) with the red and blue, which apparently aren't SUPER common, and it's worth more than I thought (but not near as much as this one seems to be).
Watch makers are absolutely amazing especially in the early days.
Another awesome video! Just incredible!
I wonder how much he charged for this service
38:26 Yeah, this is the 2nd video I’ve watched where you’ve either sanded down the damage to the crystal or replaced it altogether because of scratches and dings etc.    Yet *ALLLL* the rest of the damage is considered “patina” and you refuse to do anything about it. I honestly can’t wrap me head ‘round it.
Expert pert pert
My hands could never be that steady
Still would like to get you to look at my vintage Mickey Mouse Watch. I called the number you provided about a year ago. Still interested in getting it working? Thanks...
I think its sad that you changed the christal. In my opinion it had so much Personalien and story zhrough the cracks.
Fascinating! This guy is like a surgeon, like a heart or brain surgeon. Though I really don't know the terminologies he's saying, I'm really impressed by how he do it. Wish he was the one who repaired my Oris watch years back because after just using it 2 months after repair, it stopped again. Now it's stocked in my drawer for a decade.
what are these pink jewls that you have cleaned and oiled 34:35
I'm hyper impressed with your enthusiasm and this incredibly rare Rolex Grand Master ❤
Mindboggling and totally engrossing. Thank you very much.
Amazing find and professionalism. Besides the repair skills, you have amazing storytelling 🎉
Ah no, I do not know anything about Rolex or other vintage watches but…I could watch this professional at what he does with enthusiasm and praise . The dialogue along the visual was captivating ! Anytime this level of professionalism is displayed, I am in ! Thank you .
A very messy job, especially when removing the bezel.  The entire case and bezel insert were marked.
crystal is damaged due to radiation ☢️
Great resto, you just earned a new sub
The watch it ugly
After putting it back together, I would have extra pieces.
Truly incredible work, i will be watching much more of your work, really brilliant, thanks a million.
Beautiful.
Such a good watch! Great channel and brilliant work!😮😊👌👍👏🙏🙌
Would like to see more detail on how to release spring tension
Nice but if you look at the 12 o clock is canted left about a mm and not centered.
As I watch You dismantling smaller and smaller parts I can feel a certain amount of tension,but it's fascinating to watch an expert at work,no pun intended.
To breathe new life into a priceless piece of history, that is the mark of a true herald of the craft. Fantastic restoration, insightful commentary, and absolutely stunning end result. I hope the owner continues to preserve this marvelous time-piece.
I'm doin my best to become a watchmaker
Amazed the lume is still intact
Bro you sound like Ray Porter 😂 (audible performer)
Beautiful!
Great work
there was a famous story about WWll women painting insruments for aircraft dials with barium, they liked their brushes with their toung to give them a point for detail work. they all died of cancer in the jaw area
Great work. But I have to point that be extra careful using metal screwdrives (see de scratch on min 18:32).
Rebuilding a watch without oiling the movement??? Lol
Generic parts on a watch that special is criminal. Send your watches to a real watchmaker. Hobbyists are cancer in this industry. Anything to just get it off the bench and make money. Gross
I have an omega that need restoration , is that something you can do?
I see that you are wristwatch revival, but do you ever work on pocket watches?
I’m not a watch person…I think they are useless in the digital age (Apple watches and cell phones) that said your care and attention to detail and the craftsmanship of watch itself was why I wanted to see this video ! Well done ! Your work speaks for itself and as far as concern worth every dime! Hopeful the (new) owner appreciates your restoration as much as you appreciated doing the work.
More please.
Whats the advantage to finger condoms over regular rubber gloves?
Chefs kiss
I admire you, your passion and low level approach to what you do.
So satisfying to watch! I recently got my grandfather's watch. It was from my mom's side and my grandfather gave it to my dad. Unfortunately my dad didn't take care of it so it needed a full restoration. It's a Bostok, I found a guy that specializes in Rolex working on it. Looking forward to get it back.
Amazing work.  Very satisfying to watch your meticulous work.
Sarà pure un pezzo costoso ma è proprio brutto
Just out of curiosity, what does charge for a restoration like this? It looks so labor intensive
You're incredible. So can you safely wear such watches with radium at such high levels?
Don't tell your wife you were using her toothbrush. :8)
Epic restoration the soul of this watch is saved and the life of it continues. Well done.
Feels like that crystal could have been saved. Just polish what you can and keep the crack pattern
Epic craftsman….epic viideo, epic voice
I really enjoyed watching your video. You are amazing. Here's a big Thank You from David. I love beautiful watches.
Thanks! I bought 1 new ~1969. Later gave it to older brother who had no appreciation of a precision instrument. He took it to local jeweller for service who destroyed it. He didn't ask for it back. I suspect jeweller lied & kept/ sold watch. I cry inside whenever I think about story.
Surely be up for sale now.
Wow, what an opportunity! I'm no horologist, but I do have a history degree and can greatly appreciate your client's find!
WOW how on earth do you know where all the pieces go back . Great vid.👍
Very impressed. Super job done, well done Sir, you are a genius. Best regards Ata
1:55  THANK YOU FOR GETTING A GEIGER COUNTER.  Every time I saw you working on an older watch it gave me the heeby-jeebies because of the radium issue.  I own a few and while I'm not afraid to wear them, when I work on them you'd think I was dealing with anthrax the way I mask up and work outside to avoid getting radium dust in my workspace.
Since you didn't get all the gunk off the bezel underside isn't it just going to grow more green stuff again
Doesn't the face need cleaning too
Isn't specific torquing required
Hi can you turm my casio calculator watch into one of these for free
It's an old watch not vintage.. FF
Somehow, you've made taking apart a watch interesting. Good job
I need a watch serviced. Vintage Omega. Can I send it to you?
nice....
Simply amazing!
so cool
Thank you for keeping it original……..would of been insane to polish that history away ❤
how can an average person determine if the bezel is original. Beautiful watch by the way. Can you get the original leather bracelet reconditioned?
So, on Antiques Roadshow it says redoing stuff devalues.  But I know that's not always the case.  I wonder what it is in this case.
Mechanic surgery! Many thanks for the procedure explanation. Regards from México.
Had an Uncle Bill in Ainsworth, NE who kept a 1949 Packard (mint) und3er tarps in his detached garage from the farmhouse.  I don't think he ever drove it.  He would just look and sit in it.
Wow,  finally found a channel that doesn’t take minutes away from my life. Absolutely amazing wonderful enjoyed every minute of it.🥇
OIL UP THE JEWELS
The video is so much more enjoyable on mute.
Wildman - I told my wife to chant  mantra like -  Marshall Marshall Marshall   When I’m spazzing out on a spring bar. ❤ your  style. Thancks
Lovely.  I would be fascinated by the process used to fabricate the balance wheel.  All those tiny screws added to the rim.
Craftsmanship is timeless. What a beautiful machine in the hands of a skilled mechanic.
Every time I watch these, i get anxiety thinking of how the hell you know where everything goes back together. Amazing as usual
Great feature.  Just happened upon you vlog.  Some watch.  But curiously what was the cost to repair the watch?
Came here for the mechanical craftsmanship, stayed for the wholesome enthusiasm
When you have to replace parts, any parts, do you use OEM?  I would think Rolex may not have these any longer, but it would be best to use OEM when you can.  The crystal being the main piece i was wondering about.  Just curious.  edit: I did see some of the info I am asking later in the video.
How was the final time graph reading?  Never mind. I found it!
I wonder if you could use a laser or some type of UV light to clean the watch faces and dials.
This is fasinating. I just recently sent my GMT (1975) in for a cleaning and refurb. It's been through hell and still runs perfectly.
Do you play Magic? I saw a Magic playmat. Kkk
My heart was racing as  I watched you perform the last part /bezel cleaning and snap 🫰
I think this is the closest thing ive seen to the watch my dad bought shortly before he passed. Possibly a subset from this same series, albeit much less valuable as such. It stopped working shortly after i got it, so i never got to wear it much (Which considering it also has the Radium Dials, probably a good thing.) I've had a slight interest in watchmaking so this video might be a good indicator for what's going on under what is now My Watch.
I didnt think you cleaned the old oil and dirt off of it enough. There were still yellow staines on the stainless steel when you were putting it all back together again. You could have gone one step further to brush the old oil off in my opinion.
That was very satisfying to see the watch come out so clean and be restored. Great job
where can I find your recommendations for tool kits for beginners to intermediate craftsman?
Love watching these videos,  try talented, that is an amazing watch , Manchester uk
Wow, I enjoyed every minute of this video!
i can’t tell if this is live commentary or not lol
🎙🎙Ok...I'll say it...Marshall should be doing voice overs in movies and🎤🎤 commercials. I'd also love to hear him read every book in the Library of Congress while I'm on a roadtrip. Can you imagine how enjoyable a movie would be listening to Marshall narrate it?
Thanks for the additional scratches in the inside...
Contact cement a lead disk on the back. The Florcesent lights will come on without turning on the switch.  I am joking. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL BRAVO...!
May I ask, where did you get the replacement parts you needed for this Rolex?
I sit here I wonder what the story is behind the person who put this watch together years ago. What was his home life like, who was he? I wonder.
There is so much pointless rubbish on You Tube and then there are craftspeople like you. I know what I’d rather watch (pun intended).
Amazing work dude!! 😺
Where was that watch when JFK got shot?
The Bob Ross of watches.
Beautiful job on a beautiful timepiece.
A watch made in the 1950s with genuine radium! Poisonous and Toxic to the hilt!  This chemical was added to watches and clocks years ago so they would glow in the dark. Turns out it was very dangerous as it CAUSES DISEASE AND ILLNESS!! My lord, only in the 1970s did workers making this finally told.
This video stressed me out the entire time. lol
"it's radioactive, you should be very careful" while opening the case allowing to fly it all over the place :)
The damage to the acrylic crystal ...probably is solvent exposure,  chlorinated solvents and acetone craze acrylic and polycarbonate plastics...jay
What a piece of history! Beautiful!
Your videos are incredible.  I love the way you explain everything in EVERY video, as if everyone is a first time viewer.  I'm actually seriously thinking of buying a watchmaking kit and starting on this hobby.  Thanks for these, I've subscribed and will keep following.
Great Channel! I’m really curious if you could provide additional resources for getting into watchmaking/repair field? Books, classes etc?
2 words!! BAD ASS!!
The corrosion in the crown…my 16014 when I got it had the top of the crown worn down to a brass like material. Given the green color, I think the older Rolex crowns were actually made of brass.
Absolutely gorgeous piece! Excellent workmanship on your part…Wow!!! 🥰
It is much closer to between 25 to 35 thousand depending on condition for that year and model, nowhere near a 100 grand though it is a nice watch :)
Maybe this is a silly question, but why you did not remove that yellow-ish stains, like the ones in the spring case ? (22:50)
Well done. Well done.
Another great video - thank you. I’m curious, how well did the servicing and cleaning affect the bezel action?  Did it turn ok without all that nasty gunk?
Sir you are a master great job ,i have 2 antique women watches that need services,I will be emailing you soon.
I inherited a Sub from 63 that was passed down from father to son since the mid 80's.  After the servicing it runs, well like a Rolex. One day my son will also enjoy it.
I have so much respect for Rolex owners who actually wear their watches this way
I have a Rolex Daytona 6239, that seems to have moisture erosion. Do you think you could restore it?
Great video!! Loved all the details and the narrative you provided. 🎉
Amazing.
Hands seem fuckin shaky for a watch man
I wonder what the owner ended up doing with the watch. Did he sell it?
In 1968 I was a binman in N Ireland. Summer job , I agonised about an Explorer at £57 , about $65 . In end didn’t buy and saw your restoration , haven’t gotten over today’s value . GMT Excellent .
Inside a Rolex* quality parts...
Beautiful work 👍
Very nice. Gotta say though I'm slightly annoyed by the dust left underneath the crystal.
That pattern of cracks almost looks like it wasn't shattered, more weathered to the point of becoming brittle and cracking on its own. Not really sure how the acrylic material used in watch crystals stands up, but that might explain how wild it looks.
I have a Rolex I need to have looked at are able to do so ?
All your tools will fit in one box…?  A very large box maybe.
9:47 for my reference
The foot bone connected to the leg bone, The leg bone connected to the knee bone, The knee bone connected to the thigh bone, The thigh bone connected to the back bone, The back bone connected to the neck bone, The neck bone connected to the head bone, Oh, hear the word of the Lord!
So my old Rolex and Breitling in my collection could be valuable…..I’ll just hang on to them and appreciate them all the more!😃
Beautiful job.
Man, I wish we could see the reaction of the owner! I wonder what they're gonna do with it.
what brand of a pin vise do you use?
I have a Rolex ladies watch from the 20s or 30s maybe. You wind it up. But it’s s getting tired and no one local will work on it because it’s old and there are no parts or something. It usually keeps okay time while I’m moving around be occasionally it will stop. I have quite a few vintage women’s wristwatches and a few pendant watches as One year I got angry with leaving the house with a watch with a dead battery so I bought a lot of wrist watches that you wind. I grew up with them so winding a watch before bed each night is nothing to me. I was surprised when one of the watches I bought was a Rolex but I know nothing about it.
This is the definition of professional. When you say you’re a hobbyist I don’t believe you. You have professional experience idc you worked in the watch shop or something… what you just read a lot of books…?
6:56 No wonder why these are so expensive. Worth it.
"Very well worn, radioactive af 1950's watch"  Did grandpa happen to die of cancer??
Yeah, I'm pretty sure those were recalled for being dangerously radioactive...
I've got loads of Rolex watches for sale. So stop calling these ultra fake £100.000 rare  watches more money  than sense
Just incredible results-great job. Love your show. You have so much talent.
I’m sure watch makers and restorers create the tools used as well. The precision is amazing!
I kinda liked the distressed crystal honestly.
Great job!🕶️⭐️🕶️🕶️⭐️⭐️⭐️🕶️🕶️⭐️
After watching this I think if you can repair this watch you can repair anything
nice work, but $100k?? what's price after restoration $150k? there's expense & there's stupid expensive...pick one
Dafingacondoms
Hello there, I have a 1999 ROLEX SUBMARINER 16610 DATE that I would love to have serviced. Can you assist? Thanks in advance.
I just found one of your videos and all I can say is amazing and very interesting ❤
I bought a Baylor Era gold men's watch from the 50s maybe  60s in real  good condition  what can you tell me about it it's a automatic  watch.
Not a hobby to take on with toddlers in the house, lol.  Maybe in 10 years.
👏👏👏
When you remove parts from a watch and place them on the mat, do you have a system so you know where they go when you reassemble them? R just put them anywhere as you recognise each part?
I've just notice how many subscribers you have! Have you considered interviewing significant watch world figures to reveal to your  audience more of what goes into the design and manufacture of high end watches? E.g. Head designer of a watch manufacturer? What are the factors to be considered when designing a new watch mechanism? Why does the design of the internals change over time? Just because it's fun to solve the same objective in different ways? Marketing to create collectability? Make use of new materials, technology? Is a watch by a well known high end brand like Rolex really inherently a better watch than a cheaper but also well engineered lesser known brand? How accurate are mechanical watches and why bother when electronic watches are 100% accurate and much cheaper, and the time is on our phones, anyway?
Why don't you use an ultrasonic cleaner??
Absolutely beautiful watch and amazing workmanship restoring it.
Great video mate I really enjoyed the whole thing, I love the engineering involved in old watches, Personally I don't see the ridiculous value but I'm not driven by money, I wouldn't pay more than £500 for any watch and I prefer modern watches like my Garmin, But I do appreciate the artistry of something like this.   My brother collects watches like this maybe not quite as rare and expensive as this one, But he has a few rolex's I believe.
really really cool video
Thank you Mathew. Your macro work is amazing. I wish my hands were steady enough to do this.
31:30  "now we can move to the exciting part"  lol.  I was already excited.
Very nerdy stuff. ❤❤❤
I just watched the movie The Alpinist and some sections of this video brought on similar feelings of knowing you're watching a pro but still nervous for them.
I'm always awestruck at, not only the complex beauty,  but also the ability to keep track of all the parts and get them back in the right place!
As an hourology fan, that was impressive...
Lovely. Just.... Lovely!
Im still impressed with what we could machine back in the 50s. Damn shame that people dont know how to use a lathe anymore. So much stuff that was built to last made by the average american in factories.
Incredible! I have trouble tightening the screws on my glasses…
WOW is right, I have never seen this kind of thing according to watches, but dude you are the man, this is actually cool as hell. I cant believe the stuff in a watch. I have a whole new respect to watch making, and repairing. This is very cool.
"HELLO THERE" me- skip
how did you get into watch restorations? did you start on cheaper watches by dismantling and reassembling or is there a course one should study?
😂 Time Peice Gentleman help you sell that.
Nice one,  manufacturer bid on their own watches at auctions to skyrocket the imaginary prices. Who would buy this, even if its restored ? if its not Rolex or Omega itself ?
Be proud of yourself! Merveilleux. ❤❤ 🇨🇵
Nice work but that IS NOT a $100,000 watch. Not even close. Not ever. Just stop now.
Beautiful watch and incredible trust in you
How come a Rolex just died !!! Marshall, you said a Rolex lasts forever! You know your mumbo jumbo talk and it could be passed on to generations to come 😂.
I’m a dental technician, we are working also very precise with small stuff, but related to your job, omg. After watching your video, I feel like I’m working with rocks. We have some small screws and I thought they are very small, but the ones you are working it………. 🙈 Congratulations to this beautiful work, very well done 🙏🏼
Dope content you've gained a new sub
Very skilled great watch
Super enjoy this video. Thank you. Your expertise n passion in your work is amazing. 👍👍👍👏
very absorbing episode, enjoyed every bit.
Hello, first of all let me tell you that your channel and your work are extraordinary. On the other hand, how much would it cost to fix a watch like that?
Hello, first of all let me tell you that your channel and your work are extraordinary. On the other hand, how much would it cost to fix a watch like that?
I’m not sure but I learned on a mechanical movement never try to set back the stem at midnight! Change date always between four in the morning and not later than nine in the evening window! Depending on the making the mechanism could be damaged! Just saying as a Biel/Bienne born Swiss… see the plus🇨🇭 and thanks for the video!
Unbelievable how many parts those watches have
всё понятно и чётко.
100k for a plastic watch is wild.
Amazing
That really is a thing of beauty. It’s funny like you said I have another hobby guitar making and repair redesign and it’s too dusty for my little studio apartment. And off you have ever gone from strip sold refinish weekend it’s insane dust and paint fumes and etc and it here everywhere it’s a major clean every time. I am going to jump down the rabbit hole with y’all thanks lol
Hello, it’s a thermoset material they don’t remelt like a modern thermoplastic polypropylene or even polystyrene/polyethylene. I’m going to do one of these little starter kits which will be cool to get me going then I can wait for a broken Jen to land in my lap. I actually had a customer yet and get me to take his 30k Rollex and I said no way I said I would take it for a small fee and find someone good to have do the work. Money is not as important as my word. I think that’s what I like about you. You are honest and that says more today than ever.
Bro that thing came out straight out of fallout with all that radioactivity ☢️ 💀
Anyone know what the box he uses to hold the loose hands @ 9:29 is called? And where i can buy one
I would never wear that watch outside in fear of it being stolen and losing my Grandfathers watch
When you replaced the spring did you use one from Rolex or one of similar grade? I'm sure there are different qualities of springs.
great
Be careful handling that thing. It is made to handle the depths of the ocean and hence the sunlight can't reach that area, as you said, they use a very radioactive material named radium to give the blue glow in the dark.
I so appreciate watching someone who is a master at their craft. Wonderfully done! Cheers
Love the attention to detail
Such a talented man love watching you working
Reminds me of a rolex in the 1960s movie goldfinger
A true craftsman at work. A beautiful watch and movement!
What would a restoration like this cost?
Stunning job. Well done.
That much radioactive energy coming off that thing 😅 TICKING TIME BOMB !😊
Cool video.YOUR A BRAIN SURGEON 😅 AMAZING..hello from Ireland
Does it reduce the value of the watch to replace the radioactive lume?
The finger socks got me 😂😂😂 0:11
What a great watch! What a great job you did. I am impressed.
Great job, well done. Too bad it is the watch with the most fakes so no one would believe yours is a real one!
I couldn’t watch this with the pink finger things. Why not wear cool black nitrile gloves? Allergic?
When I see such a work I admire this civilisation that was able to produce such craftsmen.
I was DYING waiting for you to remove the back to see if it was damaged inside!  I watched this start-to-finish!  This really was a RARE piece!!!
18:30 scratch?
I've noticed in a few of your vids that you exclusively use the lubetta on the automatic works, whereas all the other similar parts get a bath and individual lube.  Why is that?  Can the automatic works not be cleaned the same way as the other parts for some reason?
Grandfather's watch.    I hope you washed your hands afterwards, you never know where its been.  lol
Как это дерьмо может стоить 100 000??? Этот мусор скучает по помойке!
This is awesome but I looked at the tool kits he’s selling and about passed out I understand you fix Rolexes lol but not everybody’s rich $849 for that tool kit I bet you wouldn’t be able to keep them in stock if they was $200 or $150
This is a SERIOUS game of Operation.
Good  job!
It looks like my Tudor BB GMT
Marshall you magnificent craftsman what a ride!!! You have to start saying TADA at the end because we're watching a magic show!  Outstanding I must say.
Beautiful, beautiful piece.
Great video! Do you have method of keeping track of the parts your removing? Like how you’re placing them on your desk?
I dont even own a watch but i still watched this , not too shabby
Would you dare to restore that famous Antikythera watch mechnism to full functional glory? I think this would break the internet!
Just got my GMT II and Daytona back from an authorized Rolex service. Nothing unusual or excessive wear. Did the full disassembly, cleaning, inspection, reassembly, lube, polish case and bracelet back ro factory spec showroom new condition. Cased, time and regulated back to factory specs. Now I'm good for another 15 years.
Why don't you sort the parts when you remove them?
I'm sure everyone watched this until the end was thrilled to see the watch running again.
Man plans, God laughs.
Stunning!
Fascinating
never in my life would I have thought I would be so obsessed watching a video like this!... just reinforces my belief  that humans really can invent remarkable pieces of art!
1958 the year I was born. you have such great tools. Excellent video and I thank you for it.😊
amazing but the new bracelet is a punch in the eye
I Rarely and I mean Rarely comment on Youtube videos but this video was it, I enjoyed every minute of this, the precision the delicacy the perfect macro camera work the information this video has. a true master at work! you have truly earned my like.
Just out of interest,  why isn't there a rubber gasket between the crystal and the outer ring?
I don't understand how you know and can remember exactly what and where each piece goes when reassembling. Awesome work!
Not bad, but polished  would look much better
Hey that’s MY lost watch!!! 😂
What is the functionality of the rubies?
You certainly have a gift my friend. I’m so impressed by people who can work on watches, more so a watch such as this one with the potential to be worth $100,000.. No pressure! lol..
Grandpa died from radiation poisoning from wearing a watch for 50 years.
That Radium Paint is great for making Ninja Turtles
Great video,with brilliant commentary, You make it look so easy ,makes me want to take my father's Tissot apart ,,problem is he's still using it
Google "Radium Girls"
Also very steady hands
Clock mechanism is hundreds of years old
But terrible eye strain, not 4 weak eyes!😢
Watching this is therapy!
I would never send any of my Rolex watches to Rolex , especially a vintage one . They replace whatever they deem necessary to replace regardless of its vintage patina , they keep the replaced parts .
Hello , you definitely lighted up my rainy day with your incredible video and that insanely good job restoring a magnificent watch. Gracias
Respect for your talent...great work!!!
Hat of to you sir. This Watch deserved a second life.
a 100,000 watch. That is only possible if 20 % of the world took 80% of the resources.
Amazing!
An Alpha particle is a helium nucleus, two protons and two neutrons.    It is big and heavy as radiation goes relatively slow.  But it hits hard and can break the double helix of DNA.  So not trivial radiation, but not going to make it through the case metal.
OMG what a Job .. woow
Nicee
There's something therapeutic about watching this.
Does anyone have a clue where I can find 1953 Rolex Explorer dial and hands for 36mm Rolex 6350 movement? I have Rolex 6350 but it has newer Rolex dial on it :( a shame
He named every part of the watch and its purpose. Amazing  restoration.
Outstanding time piece. Well done!
Hodinky means wristwatch in Czech :)
Do you pressure test after restoration?
Great to see, your very talented 👏 😀 👍 cheers 🍻 from Australia 🇦🇺
Скільки «зайвих» деталей залишилось після збірки?
After you finished, you didn't rotate bezel!
🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶💕💕💕💕💕
Why you dont clean as new one? Sadness…
I am wearing a 1960 MARC NICOLET skin divers watch which I have owned from new and it keeps good time. I understand only 600 of this specific model were made - any ideas as to value?
call me classless, but I would've liked to of seen the bezel get restored... great video all in all! Amazing work!
I love these videos but it’s really cringey that the commentary is clearly done afterwards yet you say stuff and do expressions as if you’re saying it live
love you brother. you do an amazing job, and I wish I was so talented like you
This is one of those strange aesthetic things that makes you wonder why.  Why is it that this watch is so beautiful?  What makes us love the way it looks?
Better than any new "Pepsi" out there. Great job.
So entertaining, wow
Could you service my Seiko SKX? The last service ruined the watch and the movement is weird.
Seeing the radium glow really made my heart sink, such a small device cost such a huge human price. Glad to see it honored and restored.
Beautiful
Awesome video but even if I had the money I wouldn't spend all this money for these watches lol  just stupid in my opinion.   When your watch cost more than some people make in two years that is just sad.
You are a professional watchmaker after saving that epic Rolex. I don't care what anyone says.
Spellbinding.  That hour just disappeared.  Gorgeous piece.
Bakeolite was the material old black dial telephones were made of.
це не вартує 100к
Watching all those tiny parts getting disassembled is giving me anxiety
In a hundred years someone will want to know who did this great watch repair. Please leave your mark and claim to fame.
Personally I prefer my Casio Men's W800H-1AV.
The radioactive element is insane
This video has me dialled in
Can anybody tell me what I can do if I want to restore my dad’s watch who passed away recently, went through major water damage.
Don't ever sell this watch....this is the definition of a legacy time piece 😂❤
Not a comment but a couple of questions - why place all removed parts on the work-mat and then place them into the baskets for cleaning?  Have viewed several vids and it appears that the placement of parts on the work-mat might be in some order of disassembly but the placement of parts in the baskets is related to size.  What’s going on there?  Explication in a future vid would be helpful.  Thanks!
superficial restoration
Did you perhaps mistake TWA, when you mentioned the blue and red bezel, for PanAm? Pretty sure blue and red would be for Trans World Airways.
James Bond wore this watch the only time when he lost and the girls rejected him. This watch broke in the encounter. Since then, he was wearing Omega and this watch was hidden in his friend's drawer.
Awesome
another winner sir
As always Marshall love your content
How do you know which screws to put where when you put it back together?
You need to watch Red Dead Restoration to see how it’s done properly.
стрелки сыпятся уже надышался радиоактивной пылью :(
6:30 I love your dedication with your voice-overs lol.
Mein Gott, so viel Radioaktivität an Handgelenk 🫨, da stirbt man doch sofort von, oder?  😂😂😅🤣 Ich glaube von so viel Radioaktivität fällt noch nicht mal ein einzelnes Armhaar aus 😂 Das der Uhrmacher nicht sofort einen Atomanzug übergezogen hat, wundert mich.
Another awesome video! These really bring me peace, seriously considering taking it up. Question, do you ever worry about the jewels coming loose in the cleaning machine?
A beautiful looking Rolex restored to its former glory by a master of his craft. Relaxing and informative. Thank you .
I started watching, and cancelled a lunch date to complete the video! Amazing!
My grandparents told me they always had to do this exact same process to their watches before they walked to school every morning…uphill, both ways.
is that a Mercedes symbol on the one hand?
My Brother in law was in Kennedy first class of the Army Special Forces in the 1960's, he had a watch just like this issued to him.
Thanks!
Honestly 11 is likely just background radiation
I love YouTube, I am constantly finding new obsessions. What an amazing piece. These are things we all wish we had left to us by some long lost uncle.
❤❤❤
great work, but you talking doesnt do it for me. I would prefer background music
This is a true testament as to why a Rolex is a Rolex and a watchmaker is a watchmaker.
I was watching an old Pawn Stars episode on vintage watches.  The message was, old watches are worth more unrestored.  They basically said original Rolex watches and parts were worth more in original condition.
Im obsessive compulsive and this is precisely timed perfection that is so satisfying to my mind, when you are done there’s no question that it is done exactly right. In a very selfish way let me say thank you. I believe a truly OCD mind will understand what I’m saying.
I have a 1958 GMT Rolex with a very rare Rolex wrist band, my father bought it at the PX on Wake Island. I am interested in selling my rare Rolex.
How much did it cost to restore this watch?
One question! How to see when a Rolex watch is 100% Rolex Made?
These individuals should get paid high dollar!
I love watching, talented, passionate artists do their thing. Love your videos, sir! I'm such a fan.
Him: “It has an Illuminous material in the bezzel!” Me, aware of the material used the most back then: “Oh that’s so si-WAITWAITWAITWAIT!!!!”
I absolutely love your videos, your articulation of the ride handling and potential living with the bike are nothing short of brilliant! I bought the 350 classic from your analysis of the bike. And you were 100% correct. It's the longest bike I've owned. But when I've watched you in Bali etc on a scooter it made me want one. I've bought the Honda ADV 350 . I can't believe how brilliant it is! So practical, smooth and fast it is. I've had them all ... Triumph 1200 Thruxton R , ZZR 1400 , R1 , Bandit you name it. But just being able to lock things under the seat it's brilliant. I know I know a scooter might not look cool , I know! But it's great for every day. And I'd happily go to France or Spain from the UK because of it ease of use. I've followed you both from the start and love your short films. You should be on mainstream TV. Better than just a bike show with your travels included. Best of luck going forward.
You could tell the dial was refinished right away by the discrepancy in condition between the radium on the hour markers and hands. Still looks vintage however, mid 80's perhaps for the dial refinish?
That is just STUNNING. You did it justice honoring the watch, maker and owner.  He’s going to be thrilled. I wish we could have known what that watch knows.
👍Great job ! Didn't even see a single can of WD 40 .... Jus kiddin 🥳 . Sterling job , way above my pay grade , an patience 😇 . I'll stick to my G- Shock ! 👏👏👏🍻🇬🇧
I'm not sure what impresses me more; your watch-repair skills or your video/audio skills. 👍🏻
I like how you corrected the bezel by a hair after it looked a micro-millimeter off. You should have shown how you went back in.
Not sure you should use the word " break" when discussing repair "I think I am gonna use a pair of pliers to try and BREAK that dirt free." Lol j/k  ;)  .
What does this repair do to the value if he wanted to sell it?
no such thing as a 100,000$ Rolex, defiantly no shortage of idiots who buy them
Boekanier,  not Brazil,  Haiti rather.
You never showed the bezel turning!
Wow that is a cool watch! I don't wear them but I have a lot of them.
Low viscosity oil - high speed/ low load Low wear conditions   High viscosity oil - low speed/ medium load or  wear conditions  Grease- low speed/ high load or wear conditions
The most impressive part of the video from a fitter turner (overqualified machinist) point of view, is how perfectly made every single component is, besides the square hole in the centre of the ratchet wheel, has burrs, but apart from that everything looks as good as you could hope to machine it
are ultrasonic cleaners good for watch parts?
Sir, you are a real artist at the height of your profession, your detail and explanations are entertaining and beautiful to watch.
Fabulous Job! Great watch as well!
Well done, fantastic pal🇬🇧
Fantastic work, the respectful detailed commentary is rewarding and expands my knowledge base; along with respect for the years of practice and learning which brought you to this place and time.  I have a vintage Rolex, never opened or serviced that I would like for you to consider restoring if interested.
Shame about the dial
Owner comes from a rich family?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great video! Interesting and well narrated.
Amazing that anyone could manufacture something so complicated. All the miniature pieces and parts and the fact that you know where they all go is amazing also.
Hi Marshall, that is a beautiful watch. So right to keep the patina. Opposite end of the scale, but I just inherited my father's 1978 Omega Geneve automatic. I fitted new leather strap (I have the unused original) and gave the crystal a polish. It looks fab, but I'm too scared to wear it! Love your film quality and presentation. Cheers, Martin (UK).
I think I'd have left the original crystal and had it as a Rat-Rolex - cool to have something worth that much that looks beaten up.
Reminde me a story of a personne who send his GMT for service and they change irridium clock hand for regulars ! what a waste ! good video mate keep it up ! Best regards from Geneva
mesmereizing video,  a real watchmaker lecture !
Honestly I can watch this for hours.. ooh I have been..😊
Is it me or does it look like the magnifier for the date is a little offset??
Hey lad! I am really inspired by your videos and what you do, i really love it! I tried my hands on a pocket watch and found out that the mainspring were broken, I calculated it and all but i am having issues with finding the spring. Where is a good site that i can search on? Its an Chopard 19 movement.
I can’t rationalize that someone would wear this watch to the point it stops running and then throws it in a drawer, but also had it serviced at some point which allowed the dial to be refinished.   MAKE IT MAKE SENSE
nice job
Love to know how they managed to make all these intricate little parts, before all the modern computer cutting machines. Incredible craftsmanship
Wow i can’t believe it Radium
I can take almost any mechanical thing apart, but I can't imagine the thousands of hours and watch repairs needed to reassemble like this guy.  Just wow, great job!
Old illuminated watches and gauages always reminds me of the Radium Girls.
Actually......that model watch, in MUCH better condition than yours, sells for a fraction of the $100k price
You exhibited an amazingly deft touch as you removed and reassembled all those small parts, wheels, gears, and screws.  I just watched a masterclass in watch repair!
What a stunning piece! What would this sell for?
What do jewels do in a watch 😂😂😂😂😂❤
use Otter fat
damn nice job man! You have gotten me interested with watch repairs of all things in this world :P ;)
why do you use 3 cameras?
I’m quite curious how much he charges to do these
i cannot believe i watched full 52 min video 😇 where is my adhd now
My favourite Rolex too. It was honor to even watch you do that. Thank you so much!
Blimey, 11/58 . . . . the actual month and year I was born. So satisfying watching something the exact same age as me being fully restored. Unfortunately restoring me would prove much harder!
Do you clean watch dials? I have a Patek Phillepe dial stain ....dont know what to do?
I think the owner wore the watch untill it stopped, then put it in the drawer untill they had the money to repair it but never got there.
Great job so you are the best.   Thanks for sharing
I have a Cartier Pasha skeleton. Are you interested in restoring it. It is in rough condition
I have a Cartier Pasha in rough condition. Would you be interested in repairing it??
After watching this i can fully appreciate the intensity of craftsmanship of mechanical watches like this Rolex, the individual pieces that make up this watch is astounding. To see you disassemble and reassemble this amazing time piece, only makes me wonder how all the parts are made in the first place. Excellent video thank you.
Im from Radium city,,and retired  nuclear worker,,interesting  video
I know its not original but if I were having this watch restored with the intent of wearing it afterwards I’d have a very thing layer of epoxy painted over that Bakelite to keep it protected from damage.
could you rewind the old main spring and put it into the holder for the new spring? 23:11
Imagine the original owner who sees this now...
Cállate la boca 😡
sick magic mat!
When he mentioned "refinished dial" he just cut the sale value by $50k :D. I hope the dude wasnt planning on selling it right away
Im glad you left on some of the age spots on it
The video is impressive. You're doing a great job! I'm speechless. Many greetings from Germany 👌👍
Very interesting to see Bakelite here. In my experience, Bakelite has proven to be fairly tough. It was used in everything from jewelry, to clocks, radios, AK47 magazines (I actually have one of these) and all sorts of other things. The old commercials when it first came out showed them suspending a car using a single rod of Bakelite. Crazy stuff.  Going beyond that, I find it fascinating that they used Radium for the lume. Is that sort of thing even safe to wear?   Great vid and hats off to anyone who can work with such precision. Well done sir.
Wow, absolutely mesmerizing watch (double meaning!).
This trade is really really fidgety.. Best people for this trade live in Amsterdam!!! You need really really calm nerves to be the number one in this trade!!! I’d rather be a carpenter 😂😂😂😂
Would it be possible to over pressurize the wall and frack it with epoxy?
Esse relógio é uma verdadeira obra de arte 😍
Next would be VR version hands on training for a PHD in watch making and the developer will be sipping tea with Bill Gates
Wow, surer stuff, totally enjoyed watching this episode
$500 to rebuild it ????
QUESTION: is there a video of one of the old factory original maker / machunist builders i can watch ( no pun ) ?
It’s just fascinating watching this, it’s like a complicated operation, all the special tools and equipment is very interesting, great content 🔥🔥👌🏽
Definitely agree the deep colors of the bezel look so much better than a new one today
I play magic for a long time, and this is a voice i can recognize in my sleep. Amazing Video, really nice restoration. :)
O.K The dial has remained dirty...the indicators the same dirtyness....the surface of dial the same also....Not satisfying quality of rertoration
Wonderful video,  respect to you Sir.  So much passion for your craft.. 👍😎💭💜⌚
If the chemical makeup of the bezel dirt was analyzed, I wonder what proportion of nicotine, bourbon and Aqua Velva it would be?
The most intricate things I work on nowadays are various yard tools and AR15s and AKMs but this tickled the right spots in my brain lol.  What is amazing is that someone hand finished all of the small parts and may have fashioned them from raw using small files. That precision and skill partnered with yours is really inspiring.
WOW! Beautiful service work.
i have a citizen watch. lol i have no idea about watches. but i sat here watched this entire video about this watch. bravo on the clean up. glad you did not do anything to the finish. good job
Even if I didn't lose any of those parts, I would have never remembered where or how to put them back... LOL... I enjoyed the video and loved the end results.
You didn't move the bezel!!!
makes you wonder who invents this stuff.
Gramps had some hardcore drip back in the day, wearing a watch worth more than I'd make in 5 years!
Don't *SNEEZE* !
The definition of a class watch !
Rolex 101
Whoever had this watch new value to time more than the watch
Is this the original Pepsi
The older Rolexes are built better
Are there specific torque specific submissions on any of the screws?
Is wat een gek er voor betaald
😮😮😮😮✌️👍✌️👍
Fabolous work..👍👍👍👍
stunning video😍
I watched this…… carefully haha 😂
At 9:45 you said you have tool kits on your website. I’m subscribing now and buying em as soon as i have the money. I’ve wanted to get into watch making and repair for years and this looks like my first few steps from lurking to owning
I'd sneeze, I know I'd sneeze!
Amazing, thank you...
Funny "your tools can all fit in your desk".....What kind of desk holds all those tools and other desk like items? That special crown removal tool alone won't fit in my desk. My station has spilled over into my tool shed. Which allows for more tool purchase without the wife knowing....:) Oh and now I see a "rover press", got to have thousands and thousands in tools!
🧢,s off to u sir. 👏🏻
39:26 You mean Serious Putty. :3  Also, ultrasonic cleaners are very helpful for stripping paint from plastic miniatures (Warhammer, BattleTech, ⁊c.).
As I’m watching this I’m smoking fentanyl pill. The reason why I’m saying this is because I need help to change my life around and quit this horrible horrendous addiction of mine. WHOEVER KNOWS GREAT REHAB CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA OR EVEN ANYWHERE AS WELL PLEASE LET ME KNOW I WILL BE VERY GRATEFUL AND APPRECIATE IT SO SO MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY’S AND THOSE U CARE ABOUT🙌🏽❤️🙏🏽💫
😮 amazing work
Shouldnt this go back to Rolex to be done, 3rd party restoration usually craters resale price.
That’s a beautiful watch
Amazing work
Ce qui est fascinant ,  c'est la miniaturisation des pièces et la précision.   On aimerait voir comment ces éléments sont fabriqués . Et la mémoire de l'ouvrier pour le remontage  ! 😲
Elle donne l'heure  ?!  😁
Hey come on this watch was running before you started the service. Don’t do that. Clearly see her running when you line up the hands to remove them
🎉🎊🎉     I was so excited a couple of days ago, when Adam Savage made a positive mention of Marshall Sutcliffe on his live stream.  I had no idea  😂
I gotta admit to being a bit anxious when he was taking all the parts off...wondering how he'd remember where everything goes LOL
I have several cameras from the 50’s made of Bakelite. Bakelite is not as fragile as you believe. Now, it is brittle and will shatter if you’re not careful, but it would take some force to do so.
Is it only me or does his voice sound like neil degrasse tayson
That's truly amazing, that's art.
Absolutely  amazing  skill .love watching  your workmanship 😊😊😊
can u send me the link where you ordered the bracelet. tks
5 seconds in and im dying because of the finger condoms
Mmmmm bad professional...
this is good on so many levels!
i was expecting asmr. Is there an asmr version of this? no speaking?
Absolutely gorgeous watch. My father-in-law has a 1966 gilt dial/small arrow GMT that his wife gave him on their wedding day (purchased for $325 at the PX in Bitburg, Germany). He wore it daily as a lineman for the electric company. We had it overhauled by Bob Ridley in Dallas for his 65th birthday, and it still keeps perfect time. Great video.
So relaxing to hear your commentary on your restorative actions. Such precise work, built upon the answers from our past: "what is time?"  Thank you for what you've shared with us!
Just a fabulous video.
I found a rare Rolex in the drawer, now my brother, wants it back
100.000$ это вы звгнули черезчур
I would honestly toss this thing out if I had it. Would have never known this was $100k by looking at it, its so ugly to me xD.
With all the fancy cleaning equipment why does the watch still look dirty when you assemble? Looks like lint, specks of dust smudges or stains all over the place.
This watch should have only be touched by Rolex and not a free lance you tuber
What was the amplitude after service?
Great video! Steady hands. But all it does is tell time. $10,000. Whew.
How much do you charge for this?
ok sure but where is the pack of Divorced Dads?
This man is a real star
I was amazed how you remember those things back in the right place wow, my dad has the Rolex a 1965 oyster but when they tried to clean it the stores got robbed 😤😤
Also don't know if you've ever worked on an Invicta diver just for giggles I think it would be a treat I have a beautiful woman with a glass bottom it has the Seiko movement. Please let me know. I would obviously pay for the services that you provide. But you seem like a trustworthy man
Would you consider working on a Tag Huer Link watch I need the service it it's been with me everywhere from Iraq to Kuwait to Africa. But now it just doesn't keep time anymore it loses its still functions but I can't use it to go and measure time although it still looks beautiful and it will still move it just needs a servicing
Its 10k not 100k
Amazing content! Thank you
wow!
What watch are you wearing here? Looks like a modded roled GMT with a purple bezel.
All of my watches are worth less than a thousand dollars each. It is still a joy to see the process of restoration and maintenance of these luxury watches!
Woah sunset shot looks like where I live in Aventura! Beautiful work
The printed Rolex crown on the dial face seems to be a bit off.  Any idea why?
51:33 stunning 🤩   I’m happy this went just the way it did
47:45 were all excited 🎉🎉
43:10 meanwhile 8 big circle ⭕️ of loom around the hours ? 😅
Wow (again)!!!!!
Thinking of where I was, here in the UK, when that watch was made. Aged 8 and in the first year at what we call Primary School. I can see that world now.
Pretending that your voiceover is actually live makes these videos absolutely unwatchable - just talk in the past tense man fml it's SO UNNECESSARY
You wouldn't think a guy with ADHD would stay riveted to a 52:25 minute video like I just did.
I pulled out my Orient self winder as I started watching this video and the band I just bought for it is red white and blue, but I think it is the exact same as the band on the Omega. Odd!
Every now and then the YouTube algorithm throws a little something my way that is absolutely not a part of my usual viewing. A million thanks YouTube, you win..  Thanks also to you Marshall,  I found this a superb watch. Loved it.
This came up as an auto play video and man am I glad it did. Wow.
27:05 you're touching the movement with your bare finger
Anybody that thinks that is a $100,000 watch has too much money and a smooth brain.
Absolutely love that one of your personal watches in a Omega Speedmaster. That says a lot about the watch👍
70 years and nothing is changed. that's reparability
First-time watcher,  😂 blown my mind  the work and how you remembered where it all go's amazing.
It's not a real restoration... only half the work.  So much work for not refinishing the case and bracelet,the hands were left unpolished... maybe the owner wanted such work,I don't know.  Too bad,great watch otherwise.
id rather work on a FERRARI ENGINE THAN THJE rolex
Incredible! Never knew a watch could be so interesting! You can see the craftsmanship and where your money goes😄
your skill, and others with underappreciated skills, being brought to light is one of the good things about social media...if we could just trim the fat....
Incredible journey! Thank you for taking us on this a breath taking adventure!
Could you WD40 it priot to removing? If its in too few pieces, use WD40. Too many, use duct tape. I mean the outer crown, not internal parts.
Do you return the tarred gasket to the owner as well?
very nice logo on your website.  hope you have fun with that site.
Awesome work!  Out of curiosity, how much would a full service like this cost?
I think someone cleaned the watch face with acetone. It crazes some plastics just like that
Fascinating.
Isn’t it dangerous to wear this type of watches? So much radiation going through your wrist, since the case isn’t made of lead.
I don't know where the $100000 came from this. Watch in no way and I mean in no way it's worth a $100000. At best this watch may be worth 18 to 20 grand and that's pushing it.
One big mistake the people make when they're putting The Crown back on to tighten it down on the case you never ever for any reason just start to. Wind that thing back on clock wise because. When you? Don't catch the thread right? You immediately start stripping. The thread? Out what you have to do. Is you push The Crown in against the housing you back it up counterclockwise? Very? Slowly and not real hard and then all of a sudden. You will feel The Crown pop in toward the case that means you've hit the thread exactly as it supposed to be now you turn it clockwise and the. Thread catches and you never ever ruin the 2 and Crown. Some people want to just push it in and start turning a clock. Wise right away and that's how you ruin that entire mechanism. I own several dozen rolexes. I have never replaced a tube in Crown in my watchmaker says that's incredible. That was talk to me by an old watchmaker.
I watched this whole thing an am an absolute awe of anyone that can perform this kind of incredible work. I mean just remembering where all the screws go and looking at the dozens of parts. It's absolutely phenomenal and I commend you for being A. Master of your craft.
... And Also There is No BUMPF... It's Sunday 05:40am and I'm Happily Pleasantly Watching our Watchman Watch Repair so Watch the Watchmaker and Watchmender Mend the Watch...😂😂 21:17
... I expected this Video to be Quite 🥱 BORING.... BUT ALAS NO!… It is Very Very Immersive Indeed 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Greetings from Bradford West Yorkshire England ✌️🌄🍺12:54
I wish there was such a channel where the poster is repairing a watch like an Apple or Garmin watch. Maybe 50 or 70 years from now I’d be able to see something like this.
Absolutely wonderful.
Literally first thing I think of when you said the hands glow 😅😂
What's the nickname of this watch?  Like the black and blue is the batman, green is hulk, silver and back is the Bruce Wayne, etc.
wow
Super great. Do you take request repairs for your channel?
I wanted to see the change on the timegrapher so bad...
This was probably a green beret soldier watch worn in Vietnam.
Absolutely beautiful. I’m speechless
Perfection  Thank you for this amazing video
What amazes me as a retired machinist/toolmaker is the complexity and delicacy of these machined parts,all done before computers and CNC was ever even thought about,the detailing and polishing is amazing and the absolute precision
People finsibg forgotten rolex in drawer. Clearly has  too much money.
£100,000 Rolex? Don't make me laugh. A stainless steel Rolex GMT-Master 6542 with a metal bezel is £100,000?? 😂 I've never heard something so idiotic in my life. I can literally walk down the Road to Covent Garden and buy that exact watch in pristine condition for about £10-12,000. You have a 1958 watch, Rolex stopped using the bakelite bezel in 1956, you can do all the Geiger tests you like but your watch was made 2 years after Rolex stopped using the bakelite bezel and all you're picking up is radiation emitted by the "Glo in the dark" parts of the watch face. If your watch was made before 1956 and still had the original bezel then it's worth about £70,000 but that's a later model and it's not worth that much at all. That entry level Rolex was sold to "Pan Am pilots" and "members of the armed forces" thats the level of that watch, it's a blue collar watch 😂
Would love to know how much that replacement crown was.
Nice playmat😄
What would be the estimated value of this watch?
Wow!!!
Sir how much do you charge for an omega watch restoration?
I cannot express how impressed I am with how confidently you take that thing apart and know all of the parts!
This dude's commentary is just fantastic.  I watched the whole video. Excellent!
The Bob Ross of watch repair
Wow, man, you are an artist, a craftsman. What a talent, excellent work, I wish you the best, and i greet you from brazil. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I moaned as soon as that back came off
This is officially the MOST stressful thing I've ever watched. Good job!
I love how you dont perfect every little thing, it's something I'm personally trying to working on this year. You did a fantastic job.. the results look great!🔥
That right there would be my dream watch. Of course the prices are astronomical if you could even find one for sale.
Major skills
Fantastic!
fallout watches 😂
History: this was my uncle's watch.  He wore it all the time while making adult films with p. Anderson and many others.
You’re an artist, technician, & magician too. We hear the joy in how you work on these time pieces bro!
How does he remember where all the parts go back on.He is a genius.
Wat a tough wrk ...
18:32 😱
The owner whe he/she wants to sell it later: Used watch - Slightly radioactive, but pretty.   Well done! :-)
Fools spend a lot of money for buying Rolex. Intelligent men buy a copy.
You can afford easy
Talking a lot, doing little and a terrible restoration.
what a fabulous video, you are a clever fella putting that watch back together all spick and span
This video brought an old memory back into focus. If any of you remember "The Candid Camera", this was early in that shows life ( a black and white version), it was set in a jewelry store that offered watch repair. They wanted to see how customers reacted to an extremely nervous watch repairman starting to tell them what was wrong with their watch. Don Knotts was the repairman- this was way before "The Andy Griffen" Show", so he was an unknown commodity to the customers. He had as part of his act as a comedian, the role of a very nervous guy and when the customers saw the way this repairman couldn't control his shaking and trembling while holding their watches, their reactions were priceless- many censor bloops in the audio track for swearing and downright anger from most. It has to be somewhere in YouTube vaults, definitely worth a check. You Sir, are the opposite of Don Knotts!
So beautiful absolutely amazing
An absolutely magnificent, remarkable timepiece. Your skills too, are remarkable. Now certainly back to its $100+k value. I wonder just how much luminosity is left of that radium bezel and dial.
Marshall, after I saw the radiation being thrown off that thing, have you ever taken your meter to to the watch parts while disassembled - and specifically away from the known radiation sources? Given how much radium is in this dial, I wonder if the surrounding metals have become radioactive as well.
great restoration but these ads every 5 minutes are a joke
The dial is nice but Im surprised it is not a chapter ring. Could it be a replacement dial?
Holla, i have one to, but idont know ori or fake
That was awesome
As soon as you said "made in the 50s" and "luminescent" and brought out that Geiger counter, I was anticipating the clicks...
Hi I have rochas watch  It is not working and there are scratches  Will you restore it.?
Bro just absorbed a good amount of cancerogen radiation
I see a Magic playmat, I upvote
As a huge watch collector,    I have to say  Rolex is the most over priced watch for what it actually is, that ive ever seen.   There is no artistic value to their watch.   If you took off the name it would look like everyone elses divers watch or dress watch.        The only people who own/buy Rolex  are people who have to show people that they own a Rolex.      usually it is wanna be important people.      Don't be one.
Tudor Black bay 58 GMT.
Little bit more than just "beautiful"...
14:33 don’t know if it applies, but back in the day before full synthetic oil, the standard oil back then did not have the purification processes that we have today.   Even the standard non synthetic oil today, has significantly less particulates and contaminates within it  Also on the gaskets, that’s dry rot. Dry rot makes rubber, like a brittle cheap plastic.  46:50 and as a mechanic, LOCK TIGHT IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.
Stunning.  This was fascinating from start to end, well done.
My hands got sweaty just watching this. Too many tiny little parts.
You sound JUST like Marshall from limited resources..... ARE you Marshall from LR?
Amazing!!
Never watched anything like this before but can I just say I was absolutely enthralled with it.
Awesome video
How can I get in touch with you? I wanna will you my shop. Fabulous job!  😊
So old that it looks fake LOL. As a pilot watch enthusiast I would love to own the original Glycine airman and the Rolex GMT.
The "crystal" on a Rolex from that era wldnt be Sapphire crystal it would have been Polymethyl methacrylate as well. The different Rolex watch models that were fitted with sapphire crystals at different points in the brand’s history. Here are the approximate dates of when the first Rolex references featured sapphire crystals instead of acrylic ones.  1964 – KING MIDAS REF. 9630 1970 – QUARTZ REF. 5100 1975 – DATE REF. 1530 1977 – OYSTERQUARTZ 1978 – DAY-DATE REF. 18038 1978 – SEA-DWELLER REF. 16660 1979 – SUBMARINER DATE REF. 16800 1983 – GMT-MASTER II REF. 16760 1983 – LADY-DATEJUST REF. 69173 1985 – EXPLORER II REF. 16550 1988 – DATEJUST REF. 16200 1988 – GMT-MASTER REF. 16700 1989 – EXPLORER REF. 14270 1989 – AIR-KING REF. 14000 1990 – SUBMARINER REF. 14060 2007 – MILGAUSS REF. 116400/116400GV
Question from a non-mechanical person: How do you learn where all the tiny little parts go?  More important: *How do you keep those tiny little parts in order* so everything goes back exactly where it came from?  Yes, I 'spose you can record the entire process on your phone and play it back in reverse (?) but do watches have parts diagrams available?
Awesome watch and awesome job! Love it.. wish I could have heard the bezel rotate ;) Next time.. maybe
As an electronic technician, I find watchmaking/repairs pretty similar to electronics. It's nerve-wracking af. Disassembling, reassembling, etc. Even the cleaning. Basically, it's the same kind of job in different terms. Amazing video.
I like everything except your commentary. Its very irritating who just doesn't know when to stop.
I have a Lord Elgin, I would like to get repaired.
I’m curious if the cracking on the crystal was due to 60 plus years of radium exposure?  Possibly the radiation resulting in the acrylic breaking down?  Very impressive results.
And the Value has now gone down
I would've lost half of the parts just in the first disassembly section. Too much focus, nearly surgeon level.
Looks like an old pice of crap.
It’s a watch. Who cares.
The number of times this guy swallows on mic while taking a breathe between sentences is like nails on a chalk board - love this resto tho!
Amazing watch
Who knew i would be hooked on watching a watch being watched by a lot of watchers. 😊
patina on the bezel and the hands, not to mention the case as you indicated, is exquisite 😍
Your fine motor control is beyond impressive.
which video does he explain in detail the functions of jewels ?
I hope you got paid extra from YouTube every four minutes there's two adverts
Makes me sad him saying he can't afford a Rolex watch meanwhile the shiny island Boys, and cashmeoutside made all the money....bass-akward world we live in.
Va salut din România și va respect sunteți un adevărat maestru am vizionat cu drag tot videoclipul
fuck*** amazing work - i like it
It was so interesting to see how dirt and grime had jammed things up like that. It was a great moment when the bezel came fee and especially when you got inside it and the ballance spring moved. delighful engineering.
fake
I wonder who now is the owner of my old Rolex oyster perpetual divers watch serial number on the back of P079333s
I watched the comerciales just to help fund you on youtube
Thnks for being clear on the names of the parts. I learned alot
I did not know you can make a watch now I want to take a deep dive in something like this.
Amazing. Wonderful job and Great Video.
Nice work 👌
What really is astonishing, is that they could make that in 58! Without all those high tech machinery.
Salve dove posso comprare una corona la mia si è rotta grazie
Very informative and talented at your job sir, well done I’m just getting in to the repair side of the watch game this video was excellent once again great job.
I tried to check out suttcliffehansen but my Norton virus protection blocked it
radium itself wasnt inhertly dangerous by itself being worn on a wrist all day what made it so deadly was that the watch maker girls who worked with it would lick there paint brushes to keep the tips pointy and it would get inside them. some scientists actully dug up some of there bones to study and found that after exposing them to light then putting them in a dark room they would actully glow int he dark like that watch face.
C4zz0  skill a secchiate... 🤩 Mi piacerebbe volare insieme qualche volta...
I'm curious, I didn't quite understand the purpose of those 'cap jewels' that you cleaned around 35minute mark? What purpose do they serve in the balance?
god how i miss having you in my recommendations
Grade B restoration, could have been better.
I got one question. Why are u using metal tools? U are scratching up the watch. See 18:32
I don't own any watches even remotely close to this, nor do I have any particular interest in watches.  But, I still watched this video!  Very well done.  This guy is surgical with the smallest parts and I can't even keep track of legos.
you sir are amazing at what you do.
How do you remember where all the little screws and parts go ?!!
Amazing
I did enjoy you snapping on that watch Bezel  immensely😊
Wow
The watch started working while you were taking the hands off!
Beautiful job… well done sir 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Qué gran trabajo. Muchas felicidades. Saludos desde Cdmx 🇲🇽
Beautiful
Installer la lunette avec les doigts me semble tres risqué..... il y a des jauges de tolérance pour vérifier le bon montage. Mais vu comme les aiguilles ont été chassées.... il y a de l'expérience dans ces mains. 🤙
Thanks for the education.  Fascinating
why did you use new piece. ı dont understand. because screen bad see.
Absolute beauty of a watch!! Ashame they are priced beyond reach.....
This is the most beautyful watch i have ever seen! It's perfekt. Thank you so much for showing it and bringing this stunning watch back to life! 😍
I find myself tilting my head and squinting as if it was me setting this thing together. Damn YouTube rabbit hole!
Cool workmanship. Inspired me to be a watch repairman. Thanks for the share. Hope to see a 1958 Daytona Chrono watch pls.😂
21:55 "I am going to replace the main spring"  oh ? "I am going to keep the original spring" ah... Wait what ?
I thought you would replace those radioactive hands. Anyway this GMT is absolutely gorgeous 😍
Now I understand why your videos have millions of views. The satisfaction and joy as if I'm the one who just brought something like this back to life is great. Good job.
Would be great to see you work on a vintage seiko
Amazing video. Thank you.
Shocked to hear Marshall’s voice, I remember you talking about watches on the podcast but I didn’t know you went this hard.
Your knowledge of the interior watches is extremely impressive
Man this guy's a yapper
Why 100 000$ It's ugly  My $300 Orient watch is gorgeous compared to this
It looks bad,  brand new crystal and wear on the rest of the watch.....sacrilege.  Can't believe some1 would blow 100K on such a ZERO-class KIDDO watch, you can buy a dozen Jacob`s for that money. The Great Homo-sapiens :P
bakalite is still used today.   lots and lots and lots of toilet seats are that stuff.
The moment Marshal says “belonged to…found in a drawer…” I’m literally in tears 😭
Can I replace my casio quartz movement with a mechanical one?  I have the MTP 1183 case.  38.5mm W X 8.7mm T.  I don't know what to get that will fit the way it is supposed to.  Can you help as I watch you regularly on here.  Amazing work you do!
Incredible to see this restoration. I myself live to deal with small parts and things that takes a lot of attention. But I never realized that these watches are so complex with so many tiny pieces. I really appreciate your work and motivates me to do more stuff like this.  Nice content.  Cheers
Restoration should be more than this, I was expecting parts getting cleaned deeply, polished etc... but good job anyway
Wow what a amazing restoration project you've done well done sir. I was intrigued the whole time. Not just by the detail and the tiny mechanical parts but how interested you were about the history of the wearer and how you wanted to keep the wear and patina.simply amazingly.
"I'm NOT going to watch a guy work on a watch for 52 minutes ........"  52 minutes later....  "Well I'll be damned!"
Such a small object but 3 million little parts. I could never.
You need very good eyesight for this work. Glasses or magnifying glass would also work. And patience is very very important in this type of workmanship.
You’ll get onto a Mil very quickly. Keep up the good work bro 👌
19:11 Wow !! So many tiny parts coming out of that watch, how do you keep track of them when reassembling them ?
I don’t know why I just find these restoration videos so soothing. I guess because it’s satisfying when you watch things being restored and after they’re in horrible condition.
100,000 for GMT ?
Complimenti un gran lavoro, secondo me la carcassa e soprattutto la ghiera potevano essere migliorate
That watch is 20years older then me...wow. Nice work.
I love that it's been worn so much, and not just stuck in a drawer.
I'm 11 minutes in & already too much talking. Shhhh...let your craft do the talking.
I take my hat of to you sir the fine skill you behold keep up the great work magnifico.
I'm thinking it's radioactive and then he pulls out a Geiger counter.
How much is this worth approximately? Nobody has mentioned it yet so I was curious! I always love vintage stuff rather than new ☺️ Great resto 👍
Radium? Trash watch in my option with radioactive elements ☢️
Cool lamp by cleaning machine Watch pretty nice too 😅
Lmao 😂😂😂 the way you laugh 😆
🫣
Man I can’t believe how your narrative kept me interested.  Well done sir.
Am I the only one that thought thousands of tiny workers built watches 🧐
Amazing story and precision.
i like that you respect the watch wearer by saying it was worn well instead of well worn.
We like the wrong way in Ireland.😆 It's much more fun.😍 Oops there goes another one .🤫  3/4 of a pint. More would be better.🙄
Brings back memories of being stationed in 2ID in Korea in 79.  PX catalog had Rolex’s in it.  For $250 I got the cheapest one available —“The Swimmer Rolex”.
absolutely stunning transformation ! Beautiful ROLEX
100.000$ for radioactive watch... Yes, of of course it makes sense. You will get no usual normal cancer - but rare, expensive cancer.
But u have the bracelet, otherwise that’s not good at all.
Tack!
i checked the price, its $27,995 so why 100k title?
This is probably my 4th time watching this video and each time I am just in awe and amazement. Absolutely beautiful watch and incredible restoration job.
This is so nostalgic, I’m actually in tears.  My father used to do this stuff as a hobby. He had a full set of tools for fixing wrist watches, and cigarette lighters; manly stuff of the 60s and 70s. During our time these were everyday things. Certainly nothing vintage about them.   In fact, as young as 6, I had the “privilege” of screwing in (or out) some of these marvelous tiny screws under his supervision. I also definitely had the continued “honor” of “looking under the furniture” for some spring-loaded parts or the actual springs that flew off every now and then as he worked on these watches. I was the little sized apprentice.   While I personally haven’t seen him working on a Rolex, he told me he did a few, before I was born. I did look over his shoulder as he worked on Seiko (Japanese) and Citizen (Swiss) and other big brandname watches of the time. My mom’s wristwatch was actually a Citizen.   It was a time when watches were valued by the number of Jewels (real or synthetic red ruby stones) used in their timekeeping mechanism.   This video was so nostalgic and calming it brought a lot of peace remembering my late father. I even watched it at normal speed for the full 52 minutes.  To the memory of my father and the best days of my life I had around him.
Keep clean more
"I can't afford a watch like this" that was before the YouTube video of him working on the watch got 4.8 million views.
I've replaced a few iPhone screens. I think I can handle these small screws. :)
That is beautiful!
So many parts and you’re just putting them up there 😂🤯
love it!
I'm almost always 99% satisfied with your content! I want to love your videos but you always miss a little something! In this video, there was a little fluff of fabric near the crown 47:47 and you missed it. Other videos it's a fingerprint or hair or other dust clearly visible when you close up the watch. Keep at it though. You'll only get better. Best of luck
B-Yoodiful!
OMG 🎉WOW🎉 😮 EXERLANT WORK ❤
OMG 🎉WOW🎉 😮 EXERLANT WORK ❤
wow, it was a pleasure watch your job. Thanks
I'm really interested what the owner of this watch did with it/ what he plans to do for me personally I'm not into wearing watches but I would probably keep it
Wow!  Best video yet!  Great job!
I have a Rolex 5513, bought second hand from an authorised Rolex watch dealer in London for £860 in 1986. There were many other watches on display in the shop window, however, most of the second hand (or used, or worse, the snobbish 'pre-owned') watches had a cyclops 'bulge' and I didn't like that look at all. Mine was just your bulk standard Rolex 5513 stainless steel submariner, and as I was, at the time, a serving submariner in the Royal Navy all aspects of THAT watch said BUY ME, so I did. Over the years, and yeah, it's been ALL over the planet and in most places where sea water meets coastlines, the watch did get battered about from daily life underwater, and it badly needed servicing.  Instead of doing the necessary I put it away in a drawer in my house and forgot about it, that was in 1994. In 2023 I bit the bullet and send my watch off for servicing at an authorised Rolex servicing workshop. Off it went in September 2023 and December 2023 AND £1,540 later I get the watch back from a jewellers in Hereford. Several bits and bobs needed replacing, wheels, winding crown, new main spring, crystal and all the O seals etc etc. AND it's been on my wrist since. I have my old watch back, the weight is very welcome, I'd forgotten the sheer bulky mass of Rolex watches. On the internet the word is that an 'officially certified chronometer' is considered acceptable if it's plus or minus 4 seconds either side of zero in one day. My bulk standard 5513 'non chronometer' 1530 movement is accurate to within plus or minus .5  (half) of a second. The watch was never as accurate as this since the day I bought it. It was manufactured in 1976, according to the serial numbers on the case, and is now classed as vintage.  Bought for £860, serviced for £1,540 = £2,400 which can seem a bit eye-watering - however, the minimum price that these watches sell for is £4,000 and the price continues to go up. My watch will never be sold.     Watching this vid laid bare all the skill and care that goes into taking apart, and rebuilding these watches. A real artisan was seen at work. And the absolute genius that goes into the 'gubbins' (one of my dearly departed dad's expressions) is astounding. All that expertise is inside may watch. It was on my wrist when I played cricket at the North Pole, the Arctic Ice Pilot, an American, advised us not to wear bare metal against skin, pah, what do they know, a lot as it happens - and a flash burn for me, live and learn then.  Marshall, cheers for the vid guy, and watch out for those 'flying' bits and bobs, pinggggggggg - damn, where'd that go?
Not knowing anything about watches, i think this one looks rather ugly 😂
Watching this video does something to calm my ADHD. Normally I am bombarded with thoughts that each require mental investigation. This video bombards me with information that my brain doesnt need to investigate.  Your narration is calming as well. I also like that you are saving something that was obviously precious to someone. Great video!
The most gentle way of restoration i have ever seen, you did explain everything seriously ❤
Isn't blue and red American Airlines or US Air or Delta (If it existed back in the day)? Pan Am would be blue and white.
❤👌🏼🥳👍🏼💐great job that’s craftsmanship !TOP!
It like surgery on machine fascinating  work he makes it look easy but it not  cool watch rebuild  an watch
*I thought he had extremely pink and wrinkly hands with no fingernails.*
Wow, amazing.  I have a lowly omega seamaster which I just had serviced by Nesbit's so I love watching a video like this to see how it's done.
Start watching a guy taking a watch apart...then get hung up on the corner of the "Magic the Gathering" play mat...found myself watching for it to show up instead of him working on the watch...😅😂
Watching you’re videos is like the meditation in nature , forest ,the mountain 🥇💚🥇🙏🏼
That was absolutely awesome 💯😎
Im having a stroke this guy finds one of my ultimate grail watches in a drawer😳
Quelle magnifique montre ! D'une rareté exceptionnelle. Cela a été un immense plaisir de la voir ainsi restaurée avec autant de précision et de savoir-faire car d'ordinaire on ne peut pas voir cela mais grâce à la qualité de votre vidéo et de vos commentaires j'ai vu la belle revenir à la vie. Merci beaucoup à vous.
I need help im building a nockoff watch and idk what to do
A craftsman you are!  Meticulous and wonderful work sir!
Please start making right hand wattches for lefties. Affordable. I hate when the adjuster digs in the skin.
You couldn't wear that if it was spewing that amount of radiation.. bin it.
$100k for that piece of garbage? 😂
is this live commentary or did you add it afterwards?
You are guineas with great experience in repairing watches-awesome
Mans over here giving us an hour long detailed breakdown, historical Rolex info for the model, and servicing of what essentially is a 1950s Ferrari of watches.   Good lord lmao. Imagine finding out how much these go for in good condition and realizing "Holy Sh!t, I'm gonna RESTORE one of these?!" Edit: I pray you informed the owner of the potential market worth of this piece and to have it appraised. Something like this is worth insuring 3x over
I watched this video on mute. Couldn’t take him talking lol
You, sir,have a skill!
I did not enjoy this. I did not realise I was susceptible to this level of anxiety until I watched this. I had to remind myself to breathe during the sections where springs were being removed and refitted. It was excruciating.  I have subbed of course as I was enthralled with the entire journey. Your dexterity and calmness and steady hand are skills that I do not posess and I am in awe of your skills Sir, you are a master craftsman !!
What the purpose of the jewels
Great job
Marshall, I was curious to see what the cost was of one of these watches in 1958 and even though it sounds like nothing nowadays 258 dollars was a lot of money in 1958.
I am like stoked that you have this watch. It had never been opened before since the day it was sealed. Everything looks exactly as it should.
I am fascinated that you possess the knowledge and skills to undertake this! What does this mean for the future? Are there others learning these techniques or once we go to digital and quartz it's over? Thanks for a very instructive look at such impressive technology.
All the tools cost more than three watches!!!😂
What would Rolex charge? ?
do some buffing of steel , it will shine
All I can ay is "WOW!". What an honor plus a tremendous result. I am going to study the Seiko auto-wind mechanism. Happy time keeping, Marshal.
If we could find a magic watch and rewind time, id be all for it.
What could you charge to do this! 10k
the dankpods of watches
its 3 a.m. and I'm watching some guy on youtube restore an old watch
I was literary googling watchmaking tools when you mentioned your website. Stoked. On my way to visit now
Beautiful job man!!!!!
Excellent work.  What does something like this cost to restore?
this what I call qulaity content!!! great job master. it was worht evry minute of it. thanks a lot
Would you fix my fathers small oyster Rolex?  He retired from the Navy and was given the watch.
I wish I didn't have my essential tremor, because this looks like a truly fascinating hobby.
Brilliant workmanship!!!!!.. I was watching attentively..... But... Rubies made in the wild, just made me Crack up.. No offense 😂😂😂😂.
its so fascinating to see this dude pick apart a watch like he hasnt done anything else his whole life
50:26 is that a hair? where did that come from.
This restoration video is so satisfying to watch.
I swear I watched a 5 minute video.
Marshall, I love watching your watch repairs. I would love to do this but I suffer from essential tremor so my hands and fingers don;t function that good anymore. I am very impressed with your knowledge. I have a watch from my father I have had quotes to get fixed and I really don't understand what the repairer is saying. He quoted $300 to get the watch going or $800 to fix it properly. What is he trying to tell me?
This doesn’t look special compared to modern watches but imagine seeing this in 1958. It must have been mind blowing.
Watching this video and hearing the excitement behind your voice and seeing the insane amount of TALENT AND PRECISION that you clearly have for what you do was sucha honor!! 🎉🎉🎉 thank you! Wishing you many blessings and lots of love from California! ❤❤❤
Great work. But I can tell you that only idiots buy Rolex.
This was so satisfying to "watch"
Man, you are good with this! 😲😃👍🔥🧐
The girls use to lick paint brushes with illuminating radioactive materials. During the application. It didn’t end well for them.
So many things could go wrong with reasembley
Does a restoration like this diminish the value of the watch?
Great work. What a beautiful movement and bezel. by far my favorite era and model. I was holding my breath when you were inserting the bezel spring, the paint...again. great work.
I'm a new subscriber and I'm blown away by your channel.  I've always been interested in watches, but I didn't know that restoring them is what I wanted to do... Until now! Thank you for your content, and the manner in which you deliver it, don't change a thing.
There is something relaxing about these videos! Keep up the great work!
Wow, I mean just WOW! One of the most interesting fascinating videos I've watched on YouTube in years! Brilliant job. Thank you!
Crazy good
Great job, but I can't forgive you for leaving rust under the bezel :)
Is there a reason that you didn't hose it down with WD-40 or Kroil before taking it apart? It would be of so much help and greatly reduce chances of breaking something?
I didn't know how to can take it apart.. Such tiny pieces.. Then put it back together.. I'm amazed
The man was rough on this poor watch
How does one transport such a valuable thing?  Personally, I would say.  Also, do you suppose the radium bits may have "cooked" the crystal (or Bakelite) over time?
Beautifully done. Kudos to you sir!
Excellent execution and super exciting clip of almost 1hrs time. I watched it in one go and it felt like 5 minutes of unveiling a treasure. Wonderful work - thank you!
Did grandpa died from cancer by any chance?
That has changed my mood for the day. I shall carry on with my work, but now with great precision.
What an absolute beautiful piece of history, art and craftsmanship. Great job restoring this thing
You can see him scratch the main plate at 18:32 😂
Hi, I’m new to collecting watches, I’m looking at a Rolex that is in an auction.. I’m concerned it’s fake is there someone that I could send a picture to?? To get a section option?
It's crazy how intricate a watch really is, the level of knowledge and skill needed is insane.
Nice work sir
What watch are you wearing Marshall?
Very Interesting!!
I've watched several of your videos. This one might have inspired me to invest in a hobby I never knew I needed.
😮
i'm going to have nightmares about trying to put my GMT 2 back together tonight.
The wacky crazing of the crystal may have been caused by radiation from the luminous material, much like perspex goes cloudy in daylight from the UV.
Hey big guy. New to your page, and I love your content. Restorations are a very big weakness of mine and I can watch them all day or have them playing in the background while doing other things.   But my one question. And you kind of answer it already but I would still like to ask is why don’t you learn to fully restore? Such as the face plate? You can make the rest of the watch damn near mint, (and I know we all have our own preferences) but leave the faceplate untouched or just rub a bit of plain water on it…completely understand it’s not the monetary value but rather the significance in the memories. I think it would only benefit to learn how to do faceplates or even make templates to re paint numbers or notches.   Humbly coming from a restoration LOVER.  PS thank you for all your content.
A shame that its so edited and you pretend to be doing it. Makes the whole thing feel fake
Wow so small inside
The inside end of the main spring hooks onto the arbour, but how does the outer end of the spring connect to the barrel? Does it just grip to the inside due to the natural uncoiling of the spring gripping the inside? Does the spring ever slip around the inside of the barrel as a mechanism to prevent overwinding? Is this what the braking grease is for?
My all-time favorite television show The Blacklist had a character in it called Raymond Reddington by James Spader he wore a Rolex gmt 16700 I now call that watch the Raymond Reddington that is an absolutely fantastic watch you have on your bench
I have a Submariner I bought in 1996 that needs service.  I’m afraid of sending it to Rolex because I’ve heard they love to replace parts more than necessary. Any suggestions on where to send it?
Watched the whole video from start to finish. I never do that excellent job and very informative 👏 👍 got me to subscribe this is therapy in motion. That radioactive material is nerve raking I can imagine.
Comment
And he said "WE" ,NO HELL NO "WE" doing $hit leave that to "YOU" your funny 🤣🤣🤣 HE SAID WE
Spare parts? U don't kno what they cost? Hell there ain't no way I would ever get that back together better u than me buddy!!😰 I'm sweating damn bullets watching and he is strolling thru the damn park explaining Rolex better than Rolex or hell u may have invented the Rolex I don't know 😂
It's good to see someone take a luxury item and actually use it for daily use Instead of just babying it
I had same cracked glass in old Russian watch "Rakieta" (Rocket), 45 years old, works perfectly.
I've always been astonished by the work of a watch repair and the skill necessary to do it. But showed the  way wristwatch show us and the "simplicity" of the ongoing explanations, almost makes us believe we would be able to do it. Thanks for sharing this outstanding work with us sir, whoever is the person behind the channel's name.  Best regards from Portugal 🇵🇹
Am I ever going to do this? Nope. Did I watch the whole thing? Yes I did.
Wow didn’t know this would be so calming
Absolutely gorgeous vintage Watch and super interesting video!
I have a progresive form of parkinson combined with a dash of ADHD and looking for a new hobby. I think this will suit me, what is a good watch to start with to annihilate?
Amazing
That would be one expensive sneeze.
👍👍👍👍
Its making me wonder how they make these little tiny parts and screws. Im going to have to check that out too now
Well worth the time to watch! Thanks for sharing!
Brilliant ❤
wow! love how you KNEW how far to go! True master class in restoration & appreciation. Thank you.
ÉSE RELOJ VALE 100000 DÓLARES????
Master job, impressive work, thank you so much for sharing your talent.
It’s nerve wracking to try to remember how to reassemble this level of detail
Fast becoming one of my favourite channels, thank you from the UK 🇬🇧  Particularly nice to hear you keep and return with the watch with the original parts you replace, something Rolex does not do unfortunately.
The bezel looks to be crazed, most plastics have a chemical it does not like.  Acetone and other solvent's are hard on plastics. Look it up.
Acrylic crystal, folded end links...
Would submerging the crystal in a container with uv activated acrylic resin and placing the container in a vacuum, then subsequently removing the excess resin and uv cure, restore it?
is it possible to learn watch repair from home ? i live in a remote area. im 20 miles from the nearest gas station and three hours+  away from the nearest city.
Quedó igualito 😂
A part of me can't helpt but too wonder how much value extra the watch got by being restored to it's former glory?  Because while vintage stuff are often liked when they have wear and tear. This had a bit too much. So seeing it becoming almost brand new? Man that got too increase it by a large amount.
Great filming, and amazing work.
it looks disgusting sorry :(
see your a magic player noice
Amazing!
I’m amazed how many pieces are in a watch, and how you can remember the reassembly process.
more on the curiosity of certification, are you certified so that the value of the rolex wont diminish because some watches have to be restored/services through official channels to not lose their value, primarily because rolex is so stringent on their stuff
I can’t imagine putting all that back together
I get that you've been doing this ... but when you tear into a watch, how do you remember what parts are what and what goes with what?  I'd be at memory overload after the first screw removed.
Thanks for this fascinating documentary of a piece of history. Major skill and knowledge and courage to, even, attempt this restoration.  Once in a lifetime experience for you and us.
It's perfect
I can rebuild any engine you name it I can rebuild it ! But watch repair I would not even consider !
I do not in no way have the patience much less the talent or the ability to do watch repair work , however I do enjoy watching you do it ! This is one thing that YouTube does perfectly well it has excellent quality programming ! That has no competition !
That kept me watching, thank you
😍
Well done pal cracking job there
“What do you do for a living?” Asked the brain surgeon. “I’m a Rolex restorer” replied the man. “Touché” said the brain surgeon.
bro i can recognize marshall sutcliffe's anywhere
did the bezel turn?
This man, no doubt, can snatch a flea in mid flight with chop stix....Just amazes me that HUMANS invented precision mechanics like this. I mean, what machine back in the 50's creates these tiny precision parts?! Well done buddy. You also have a future in voice over work....
Just wowwww😮😮
😮
4:40 wouldn’t it help to oil around the bezel to get it to come off easier?
I'm pretty sure you could afford this watch 4.5 million view's 👀
whooooo that watch is F'ed!
I enjoyed every second of your video. Thank you!
I'd be willing to bet that the guy was in the military and he bought it at the PX in the 50's. AAFES used to hold some very good deals on Rolex and still do to some extent but nothing like they did back then. My uncle bought two of them each during Vietnam and Korean War's as it was considered a smart investment back then. He has a receipt for all of them still and the most expensive one was only about $400.
Superb job
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_Girls
g-shock more better.
I'm surprised you didn't Lube the crown first.  Heck, even wd40 . Bit of a rush job right there with the pliers??
I knew i recognized the voice from some where.  And it clicked when you said your last name.  Mtg!
Very impressive work, sir. I’m capable of, for the most part, completely disassembling and reassembling an F-16, and I am pretty blown away at this sort of work. Opposite ends of the mechanical spectrum! Super rad 🤘🏻
the fake voice over of you acting like you are actually talking while working really kills the vibe for me, i mean fake grunting? come on man...
Beautiful work!
Yes i don't know watches but still ... I truely don't see how people can give 100k for that crap ... by crap i mean a completely ordinary watch ... anyway it shows how much i know of the subject ;)
Casually saying that anyone can do this as a hobby is absolutely not true you sir have an amazing talent
You know your business of course, but how do you keep track of where all those screws go?
Where did your client “lose” his grandfather ?
Impressive work. Incredible to be so knowledgeable, to know all the parts to buy, the oil to apply. Personally I wouldn’t want a radioactive watch to wear, even for free.
No gasket grease?
2:22 You've got cancer, but it's not serious ! Hey🔫
Wow, I was only going to watch a few mins, but couldn't take my eyes off the whole video! The excellent & precise engineering of the mechanism in the watch alongside your humble narration over the whole project kept me glued in my seat. Absolutely mesmerising to watch. Thank you! I can only wish that all video's on Youtube were as informative and meticulous as yours.
This is only the second video I've seen from you and I just watched it in its entirety!  I am absolutely fascinated by the mechanisms and delicate parts that go into these works of art!  Subscribed, new fascination found 😅 Very nice video.
your a surgeon for watches, hands are steady, and gentle  on such a micro tiny parts. Awesome video watch it from start to end  disassembly and assembly.
Dude I'm getting antsy just watching this. Those parts are way too small! Amazing video!
I would like to get Rolex fixed… can you help?
What a pleasure to watch you and your patience.
uh, I would be horrified to take all that gears etc apart..clean it and reassemble it..If I even knew what parts do and where their place is..reminds me of old Compur shutters though
That's one rare drawer find
Thanks i loved the video also asperate the teaching
This video was just randomly played for me in a side window, as soon as I heard the voice I thought "wow, that sounds exactly like Marshall from MTG videos/events", then the "this is Marshall" was spoken and my mind was blown. Amazing video, impressive detail and professionalism.
I’m trying to track down the correct caseback tool for a Tudor BB GMT, would you happen to know what size Rolex type tool fits?
I completely enjoy your videos.  They have encouraged me to buy tools and change straps and batteries. I discovered that, at 73 years with osteoarthritis, those things are challenging enough. Kudos
Brilliant. Fabulous job mate.
I'm curious if there are any known cases of wearers or watch repairers becoming ill from radium dials ?
Great post - I'm very curious what the charges were for a servicing a watch worth 70k to 100K..same cost as a watch valued 1K ?
I’d love to see a woman’s vintage watch!
Really enjoyed it, thank you.
A kind advice. Try to intentionally put a thin layer of lead on your fingertips while dealing with sheathe like that. Like your manner of explaining things, hope there will be more of it, take care!
I noticed you didn’t torque the screws going in, or was it just not shown in the video?
Anyone know why he doesn't time the hands? From what I know, when setting hands, you typically go in this order: 1. Insert crown and stem -> 2. Rotate until the date _just_ clicks over to the next day, so it is exactly midnight/12:00am -> 3. Set all of the hands pointing perfectly at the 12:00 position so that the time is guaranteed to be 12:00, and thus as the seconds and minutes progress, they do so in sync, and when the date clicks over, all hands will be again at exactly the 12:00 position. If not, the date will switch over seconds/minutes/hours ahead of or before the correct time (although it is typically just seconds).  He's obviously a master at what he does and knows more than I do, so if anyone could fill me in on why he didn't do it, please let me know. I would be greatly appreciative! *Edit:* If you pause it @51:45, set the video speed to 0.25x, and watch carefully or hit the spacebar a bunch to pause/unpause it quickly, you can see the hands line up directly at 12:00 as they should when the date switches over, but it's about 15 seconds fast. This means the minute hand will move one minute when the second hand is at the 3:00 position, not directly at 12:00.
how do you remember which parts of the watch go where when you put it all back together again
That's some skill - Brilliant ⌚👍
This looks so so complicated. I would never put it back together and he is making it look so easy.
Hi Marshall do you service watch on request? thanks.
@Wristwatch Revival  Can I ask as someone with shaky hands, how do you help mitigate that issue?
Is your bezel washing water luminescent? Try UV light on the water, I wonder if it washed the radium paint at all.
Wasn’t there a gasket underneath the outer ring that presses the crystal into place? 🧐
5:04 No need to call yourself names, you did great... ;)
This makes me want to wear my watches instead of just collect them. Nice job. You're right, the wear on this watch is beautiful and unique.
This was very cool. Beautiful watch.
If you read this where do you order your parts? Like the mainspring screws wheels etc. Thx for the incredible video
Woahhhh look at those microsiverts go :P In-sane!
Amazing video. Mechanical watches blow my mind!
Very cool! Would the jewels used in 1958 be different than jewels now? What are they made of to last so long? Thx!
Amazing! Just a shame about the refinish dial
Why though ?
Wow,,,, Watching a watch master. No pun intended. I don't know how he keeps track of all the different parts.  How long did it take to clean this watch and how much did it cost?
Nice job.
According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, "radioactive antiques [including watches] are usually not a health risk as long as they are intact and in good condition."
According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, "radioactive antiques [including watches] are usually not a health risk at all as long as they are intact and in good condition."
I do not know how you can remember how everything goes back together. I'd love to get in to watch making or repair/restore
That watch face seemed quite radioactive when you measured it. Is that level harmful if worn daily?
Great job......Big fan of the Before and After side by side.
Wonderful watch (excuse the pun).
Very cool!! I know you've been doing this, a while. But, I'm still amazed that you can remember where everything goes! Many of those screws are the same size. I would want a mat that shows every piece, and the order. I'm also curious why you don't wear surgical gloves, the non-powdered, non latex kind, nitrile, instead of some finger cots. I also wonder if you routinely wear loupes. I'm a periodontist, so I wear loupes that are 3.75 magnification, with a light attached. I'm excited that you are excited about your craft! That's a great mark in a line, such as yours.
I would have rather seen you use a plastic pry tool. Almost every pry caused a scratch where the screw driver touched the machined parts.
The price now ??
U Sir are you a surgeon bye day? I tried to fast forward to the finished product.. but could not bring myself to do it... wonderful Video
That is such a beautiful time piece!
Absolutely super cool. Did you have to confer with anyone before you took on this project as it looks like some of the parts may have been new to you going in blind but I don't think I could do that
Awesome video! I know you primarily work on these really expensive watches, but for someone looking to get into this as a hobbyist, what kind of watches would you recommend to start with taking apart?
I always find it curious when a person supposedly "finds" something in a drawer, box, safe, purse, etc.. especially when that something has immense potential value.     hope it wasnt found using the 'five finger method' 😉. but thank goodness for serial #'s and production marks to help find the way.  because of course if those marks are missing, it often indicates a previous attempt to cover-up provenance and past ownership.
I couldn’t do a fraction of these things if my life depended on it. Kudos to you, love your work.
well done bro
I really like how you continuously change the camera angles. It takes content that isn’t necessarily action packed and makes it feel like a lot is going on. Nice work.
(1:58 - 2:31) Ionizing radiation expressed in counts per minute . Newer Omega very low , 1958  Rolex GMT super high .
How much you charged the customer to fixed this watch ???
very nice work thanks
Gayge
Wow you are insanely good at what you do and really good at explaining everything to us I’m mind blown 🤯
Been wearing a Superfake for the last 2 years. My superfake is impeccable. It's HSS and i work at a junk yard. If it were a real rollie it would already be in my junk at the yard. Not a single scratch on the superfake bugger and i really do bump into everything i see.
Curious. What was the total cost of the rework on this beauty?
Do you think the damage to the crystal was caused by the radiation from the hands?
"oh my god, this is so rare and specific... but I have a tool for that"   lol  because of course you have the super focused tool for that.
Where did time come from
Me? thanks for asking   now .. a 47 year mechanical /fitter /turner  qualified 5 year apprenticeship eons ago   have and own over 120 grand in tooling.machines  eg .. watching this,,, man my eyesight suffers lol, now there has got to be over a hundred grand of specialist tooling and what nots going on here   respect on what you do here Marshall  yep i subscribed as i find this and your explainlation  spot on,  thank you
I am so happy to see that you at least know what radium paint is, I’ve watched several guys repairing watches and clocks in here with no clue that they are dealing with a very dangerous radioactive material. I would have been a bit more careful though, radium paint flakes off and becomes dust much more easily than most people realize, I always recommended using a UV light to keep track of that dust. Gloves and a disposable surface are also helpful
You think the crystal cracking is from the radiation ?
Nice ! 😊
My first ever watch resto vid. Such an interesting hobby. I found your enthusiasm very infectious. A great 52 minutes & 25 seconds. Lovely result.
So you've said that you aren't a professional, that this is a hobby. Why would anyone bring a $100K Rolex to a hobbyist?
I want to learn watchmaking, however the fee for trainings here in the Philippines is expensive. Thanks for this❤❤❤❤
I wonder how many people in the Swiss watch industry got cancer from the radium they were all using? I'd bet the numbers were hella high.
4.3 millions views? Great job!
When you put the grease in barrel wall, why not spread it around the whole edge? Does it spin around or move back and forth? If it actually spins around, does it end up spreading the grease around the edge from it spinning if it spins?
Are you dutch
I have no doubts about your skills as a horologist, and you certainly do take care of the watches put in your care ... but that bezel is filthy. I wouldn't put that watch on my arm if I received it in that condition. Most of the filth is dead skin cells mixed with skin oil and other dirt. This reverence for 'patina' needs to be balanced with a need to be clean.
47:56 - you can replicate it. It is called "tumbling barrel".
I have never watched as episode of yours. Clicked on it because or the watch and your talent and information as you did your cleaning intrigued me. I was mesmerized of your knowledge and craftsmanship. I am now a subscriber. Amazing work! 👍
the amount of components that go into a watch are still crazy to me, could never imagine taking it apart and putting it back together again
Great job! All those parts would make me nervous.  Guess you cant drink too much coffee for this type of work !
I wonder… how much you charge for your job? I have watches in the “drawer” and usually think that your kind service will be too expensive to consider it
I'm still fairly new to watch restoration, but could the main spring not be re sprung? I've seen some videos where they take the spring and re coil it
Great work & super video. 👌 Excellence.  See you again soon. Thank you.😊
Love these vids.  I would like to try learning the art of watch repair but all those parts are so intimidating to me.
Amazing work on a fantastic watch! Thanks for sharing your expertise with us 🙏
The commercials are too much for me.
What did you use get balance wheel to run look like a marker
That watch looks ran over by car
This Absolutely Amazes me!! Well Done! Very Impressive to do something like this. Just think of the old days building things like this. Not a lot of people do why you do… !!👍
Your work is absolutely amazing enjoy watching you work so precisely thankyou for sharing
I don’t know what it is about the GMT, maybe it’s that Magnum wore it, but it is probably my favorite watch of all time. I plan to own one, and have been watching them on eBay for some years, but I am just so hesitant to pull the trigger because who knows what could be wrong with a used one. I do not want to buy a non functional money pit.   I am only 30 and have had firearm assembly as a hobby for years. Watches are at the top of my list to start working on as a hobby. Your videos and Nekkid Watch Maker make me feel that I can do it. If I work on some cheaper Seikos and build up my skill, perhaps I would feel more comfortable buying that GMT in the future.   Also, there is only one watch repair shop in my entire city (Tulsa) and the guy is backlogged by 1 year. So it is not a horrible industry. When I retire from my regular job it may support me as a side hustle. Haha   Exceptional work as always, thank you for the video. Best of luck.
Brilliant worck respect  👏
Less chit chat n get the job done, so annoying to watch when talking
That was an outstanding video what a job you did taking the watch apart  so interesting..great job thank you
А почему он их не почистил?
Не очень аккуратно. Автор сам говорит о редкости часов , о том что они дорогие. Но царапает  . Где нужно использовать деревянные палочки, пользуется железным пинцетом. Не сразу ставит по коробочкам как нужно а раставляет сначала на столе потом опять переставляет... Так то залипательно , но когда видишь как аккуратно работают другие мастера хочется от всех того же )
So, I happened to chance upon a video of you restoring a pocket watch.  I was instantly enamored and quickly found myself watching your other videos.   This entire process is fascinating.   The meticulous attention to detail, the delicacy in which you apply or remove things, your explanations and informative commentary.   These videos are brilliant - thank you for sharing them.
Where are the jewels
Either this guy is very smart or I am really stupid or maybe the both
Whatever it is. It just tells you what time it is. Nothing more. I think euh...no you are an idiot if you spend 100K on a watch.
good show
I have a very old Favre Leuba pocket watch that doesn’t work, I was wondering if you could take a look at it. How can I contact you, you are incredible
Beautiful watch
Cant believe this is even possible i would never in my life be able to do this wht a awesome job
25:16  Something I’d never know if it weren’t for your first hand knowledge.
Absolutely impressive!  Your knowledge, experience and confidence are admirable when tackling these watch repairs/restorations!  Truly!  My Grandfather was a Tool and Die Maker in Newark, NJ in the 1920's through the 1960's; my own father brought me up being precise and restoring things in our garage (outboard motors, automobile engines, etc).  He taught me tools and techniques I use to the very day I write this in My Wifes' and mine Old Farmhouse home.  The skills you have are what he taught me; if you are going to repair, do it right the first time.  Clean, clean, clean, trial fit, lubricate/sweat/loctite and then you know that repair will not fail.  Thank you for your channel.  I must have watched (hahah, no pun!) at least 15 of your videos.  Your videos satisfy the OCD in the, apparently, MILLIONS of other viewers!  Cheers!
Theres videos on the "radium girls". They painted watch hands with radium, and would often moisten the brushes in their mouths.  Some died of cancer, and many had horrible dental and oral disease because of the radium.
My Friends on a Friday Night: Hey, you ready? Me: Yeah. About to leave in a few minutes.  50 minutes later... Them: Bro, WTF!?
два камня не хватает
The OnePlus open shoots amazing video the night photos all of the photos work and the stability for some reason we can't get that same degree of quality on the OnePlus 12 otherwise maybe they should have come out with a pro version of the 12 in order to have the same camera as the OnePlus open in a non foldable phone
Beautiful!
What’s the swatch worth?
Modern watch: 11 Old watch: Run
I think I've inherited a watch that's identical to this, in a very similar condition. Yet, after watching your video, I realize I may have made a significant mistake by sending it to a Rolex service center that didn't prioritize preserving its patina. Instead, they replaced several parts and restored it to a brand-new like appearance. Can you recommend someone who could appraise my watch?
Мистер, Вы волшебник!!!! 🎉Респект и уважуха человеку с золотыми руками 🎉
Hey, I know that voice! 😮 I just organically came across this after months of watching odd tinkering and my mechanics - love this, what a great video!
Was the watch worth more in the original non working condition, or after the restoration? I don't have any knowledge of watches at all.
Amazing video expensive ⌚ watch
I just looked up prices for tools and they arent expensive so ya I also am getting a beginner guide book
Hey there I have a well I dont have it but an old man i work for has a Rolex that isnt working. Can you tell me typically how much it costs to get it serviced? I was thinking about doing that for his birthday.
Incredible job, i had the best “time” of my live watching this
Thank you Sir for uploading another excellent video. Ged.
Wow, this guy has the hands of a doctor. This makes me sad because someone had stolen a very old pocket watch ( and my father’s Waltham!)that I had since I was 16. I used to take all my watches to this wonderful old man & his son. I would always when passing stop by just to say Hello. Thank you for bringing back a forgotten happy memories.
Just ONE word - AWESOME👍👍🙏🙏
First time watching one of your videos! You, sir, are Masterclass. The amount of knowledge you share and details you notice, something only a true craftsman and watch lover could do. Appreciate your content, cant wait to check out the rest of your channel!
I've obviously seen ultrasonic cleaners before, but never a "centrifugal" cleaner. Very cool!
Man final product is beautiful.
That would be bad ass, a 54 retro rolex!
My watch! I left it that drawer. Please send it to me. Excellent workmanship.
I believe the earlier crystal were some type of plastic/acrylic.  Looking at the spidering effect of the cracking it looks as if it came in contact with some type of petroleum product like brake fluid that can break down plastic like that.
I have a rare 1879 Rolex… made in the former Soviet republic of Idaho
This reminds me of when I applied a Kraken G12 bracket to my NVIDIA 1080TI Founders Edition C9mputer GPU.  Had about 30 tiny screws!  (I put them all on a big piece of paper within little circle and notes for the rebuild...)
Stunning. Fantastic camera work as well. Bravo.
Man 😂 what a true craftsman ....I couldn't be more impressed 👏 🙌
Alert Alert ... Here we see another destruction of heritage archaeology. This man the owner, no doubt has passed before 2010. He also never took a DNA test. All the ancestry his DNA can reveal to the family is human gold and you are scrubbing it away. That watch intimately has his dna all over it. Since the video has passed again so hads this last links. Even old pipes have dna and hats with sweat bands well used- so many artifacts we can claim from our ancestry.  Vintage dealers should get on board with the sciences? If I copuld swab back in. time??? that would get me back tp pree 1600 trees on 4 sides/ un mixed.
Dunno why i find this stuff interesting i dont no anything about watches but it was good
$175.000 who say so. Not in that condition
Beautiful watch!  Hope they store it in a lead-lined box!  ;)
You do fine work I'm impressed but I can't believe that ugly old Rolex is worth a hundred grand.  I'd rather have a nice Bulova Spaceview or anything similar.  My Titanium Eco Drive is only worth about $150 and it's gorgeous.  The watch market makes no sense.
I'm not a watch person,  however I have an appreciation for antique items they are irreplaceable.  Truly you enjoyed the restoration as much as I did. Thank you for sharing it.
Anyone know what a service like this would cost? Totally just curious.
Took me a minute to realize you had gloves/finger covers on. I was going  to reccomend a dermatologist
This is so cool. You are a master class watch restorer.
I think you were just being 2 Paranoid, 4 all the work you did on this vintage rolex watch and didn't clean that bezel and bezel insert with the proper cleaners, u cheated the customer, just my opinion 😉
Quality workmanship
I have two very old pocket watches (Elgin and Waltham) both very early 1900's I love to get restore not sure how to go about it.
Nowadays you always buy new stuff if the old didn't work any more because most of it isn't worth repairing.
That was my first watch restore video I watched and I'm kinda sad the video is over already :D Bless your heart
If you want interesting follow-up videos, check out some documentaries of them women who used to paint those dials with radium; it's awful!
How did Grandpa die??? Radium poisoning
What is your opinion of a Seiko perpetual 70s vintage?
Good day to you sir i'm from Philippines i have a seiko 5 which i didn't use for almost 9 years because i don't have money for restoration can you please help me?
Very nice work. I have to agree with you. That worn vintage look makes this an absolute beauty, and knowing that it was expertly restored makes it that much sweeter. Love your work, keep them coming.
Nice work
U forgot to turn the bezel
Marshal, i am the proud owner of a TAG Heuer Calibre 60 Divers watch. It has stopped and needs restoration/service, it is in the original box with 99% of contents. Missing one rubber divers band that was extra large to fit over a divers wetsuit. I would like to send this watch to you so you can service and repair it on your channel. I would be very happy to make a donation or pay you for your services. Thoughts?
Outstanding professionalisim. Keep up the great work!
It would bring a extra dimension if the original crystal was cleaned and finnish and put on the watch again. Love the proces, calm and soothing.
Great video!  I was wondering if you were going to keep the radiation in that watch.  When I saw the numbers I jumped and wondered if that's "healthy" to wear anymore?
Never really been into watches but here within the last year, it’s so interesting and crazy how all them little parts and pieces make a Watch run and just taking it apart and putting it back together it’s just a craft and amazing
He DEFINITELY put it on for a second off camera… and i dont blame him i would’ve done the same😭🤣
Currently at 17mins in and having serious anxiety about how he’s going to reassemble this watch 😬
This s FANTASTIC!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing this.
glad MTG nerds have other hobbies! I just picked up a Seiko SSK003 GMT and am stoked on it!
I'm waiting on my next few paychecks. Started watching you a few weeks ago and I'm excited to start doing this. I already work on cars and have a hobby of a little gunsmithing and lock picking. This will just add to my skill set
Thank you for bringing us back in time.. always a pleasure to see you work on these time machines.
Incredible
I sat here for almost an hour, and barely heard a word that was said. Why is this so fascinating?!
Wow  this guy is wonderful this is the 2nd  time I've watched a full video here in youtube without skip hahaha
You say that the intimidating portion of a watch maker is the tools... i say it's all of the little tiny stuff inside the watch. It amazes me that you can put the thing back together in the end. Great work and nearly impossible if you ask me!
I just discovered this Chan& i do appreciate a decent Watch👍,And yer Man could have been a Surgeon,most impressive!
Awesome!
Oh wow someone actually used a watch for what it was intended for and wore it
Wow !!    What an amazing watch and restore  ... Well done !!
Wow it's been a while since I've watched one of your videos, and it looks like your channel has blown way up. That is awesome, and well deserved.
this guys narration is so well done, I've watched 3 hrs of these now and lost my whole afternoon, happily subbed. 😃
You’re not afraid of radium at all!
That is a beautiful time piece.
Nice work brother !!
20:19 "and you don't want metal on metal" he says while handling, manipulating and moving delicate metal Rolex parts on a metal box. What am I missing? :)
I never find watches like that..   damn!
Amazing!!! You are a master at your trade
Is this Gab Marcotti of espn fc?!!
The fact that it contained radio active at a high rate for the Luminous is something really really cool, considering that year, manufacturer knowledge is not as advanced as it is now. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I have lived with the same emotions you successful repair. I know the feeling as I repair things myself. I am not at your level and you are a great man sharing such knowledge and skill. I remember that when I was a kid and watch makers were still around, they use to keep in secrecy their trade.
Of Thérèse was i camera on it all these years then YOU can SEe wherry Its been go
Pregunto desde mi ignorancia supina. Lo externo, que está despintado, no se puede pintar, o no corresponde en un ⌚️ de lujo???
It's a perfect restoration for a wonderful watch !👏
Sorry mate, but Radium has nothing to do with Radon. Ra has atom number 88 and Rdn has number 86
Does the bezel now rotate?
I was trying to relax and let a migraine die down when YouTube steered me to this video. Holy cow was it so therapeutic. You sir are an artist.
Great restoration and a fantastic vintage Rolex. I would however never wear it on my wrist due to the harmful effects of radiation. My wife is a hematologist and treats people with leukemia and lymphomas (blood cancers). She will not have any radioactive sources in the house, such as radium dials or vintage vaseline glass. She made me throw radioactive vintage jewellery. Gamma rays will travel through metal, so a glass crystal is no protection. Anyway, rather than being guided by some anonymous comment on YouTube, ask a medical professional about the risk of a radioactive source on your wrist. 😬
Now I know why my 1967 Submariner service by Rolex costs so much.I had it new when I was 21 and now I’m nearly 78 and it’s still going strong.Worn every day.
I would say that you take more care in this service/restoration, than what Rolex would have done. The owner was lucky and wise to have you do this, instead of sending it to Rolex to do. Brilliant job!
You sound like dude who has divorced dads cards
That’s one heck of Swiss time piece history. I can’t believe how many tiny little pieces and parts make up the movement. I truly enjoyed your video!!
Another great job !
I don’t like it because it was not properly cleaned in order to call it restored… it’s like you are cleaning and vintage car only on the outside
wanna play some magic? Lol
God wears this watch
I hope the owner appreciates the care and accuracy you show in breaking it down, cleaning it, and putting it back together.  Amazing job!
On average (ballpark figure) what would a service like this cost excluding parts?
This is one of those times the youtube rabbit hole paid off! Great video
I have 3 of these exact watches. My dad uses to collect and one still brand new.
Back in the 80s I was in the military as a Supply Tech. Military watches was a hazmat disposal because of radiation.
Thank you for the best spent 52 minutes of my Sunday. But I already knew on the part when you said we get to find out if it's gonna run or not. Yeah there wasn't a doubt in my mind that indeed it would run. Fantastic video.
What’s your cost for the repair?
Maybe he stopped using it when the news about radium hit
Damnnn what a knife, dream knife but a knife like this i would only use it at home 😅😅😅
what are you doing wrong with that views PLUS patreon and still you cannot affort a watch like that?! alone from your monetized views you should be able to buy at least 2 of thoose a year. I realy hope this is just cap  otherwise something with the settings of your YouTube Channel is wrong. I got YouTube Premium, so i don't know how much advertisement is within your videos. But you should at least have some ads playing so you can earn lots of money with thoose views!  you realy earned that money! I wish you the best!😊
I'm a watch enthusiast and I suppose it's just me but I'd want that case polished and for the dial, calendar and bezel to get a deeper cleaning...  I'm all about heirlooms it just has to look as near to new as possible, is all.
This looks harder than brain surgery
If I dismantle this watch and  put together  I’ll have dozens of pieces left on the tray
I have my Dads gmt it’s from the late 80’s the bezel won’t turn And I need some links for the bracelet it does run but  I would bet it needs to be cleaned it that something you might be able to help with ?
The women that pained the radium226  would lick the fine paint brushes to make the tip more exact. Without proper hoods, etc, they shouldn't be disassembled Radium jaw and several cancers probably killed the owner before dirt killed the watch.   Gamma rays have so much penetrating power that several inches of a dense material like lead, or even a few feet of concrete may be required to stop them. Gamma rays can pass completely through the human body; as they pass through, they can cause ionizations that damage tissue and DNA.
OMG great job. That watch was Amazing. You must have nerves of steel. Im sure you client was extremely Satisfied. Very impressive skills.
You did such a beutiful job of getting it back to working condition and making it look clean and presentable without ruining it's vintage look. Well done!!
I’m genuinely curious how you keep track of those screws. They look very specific and aren’t interchangeable. But with 50 micro screws, you’re bound to lose track which one goes to where.
I'm sorry im sure you have been asked before, the video is sn hour, but how long did this take?
Beautiful work, thanks for sharing this. I’m surprised you’re not taking more caution dealing with the Radium part of this watch. It’s extremely radioactive and although in small parts it’s still particles that you can inhale or even accidentally digest.
You showed that watch some love, amazing. Really enjoyed this.
Fantastic vid and you have a wonderful attitude you have!
Watched the video with gf for 50 minute straight, thanks for work.
This watch has a "recovered from a casket" vibe...
6:30 Vietnam flashbacks
Beautiful work as always to watch 🙌 You are truly a Master at your work!!
Mark 1:15 💌 …“The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”💌🌼
Thats why the ladies that licked the brushes to paint all got sick from radium sickness.
wow
Got a good belly laugh out of me when you took the giger counter to the dial. Lovely radium, great stuff, should still be glowing by the time of our great grandkids and beyond.
Amazing job
Pure magic.
I was actually looking for something else but ended up watching your entire video with joy! I'm into watches, not repairing, too and the way you explain, comment.... everything you do AND your excitement after you did fix this amazing watch - really, really nice and worth the time I spent here!
Great job
Fascinating… great camera/editing.
its always great to watch someone display their skills with something they have an extreme understanding of. This guys understands his work on a whole different level.
that guy got wrist cancer
Source? Just say I acquired or found one. Source is just pretentious
can't even imagine dreaming up the first watch then hand creating all the parts and assembling it ..just wow.
Stunning watch, matched by your work on it ☘️☘️
Are new fake Rolex watches good quality? This is to anyone.
i dont even wear a watch..dunno why i watch all your videos :) strange
One like doesn’t do this video justice. What a great watch and a great video. Thank you for sharing
A spider glass
Watch repairs videos are just so thearputic, what an incredible vintage Rolex.
Imagine a PanAm pilot being such a respected position a Rolex watch is commissioned on your behalf.
First time watching your channel. No pun intended. Very fun! Interesting and calming to watch and listen. Thank you for the content.
My Rolex is from 1950.  Rolex won't guarantee it for servicing.  We do have good restorers in London.
the precision of the smallest parts is amazing, how are they ever made so microscopic in size? watch making must be as amazing as watch repair.
Amazing work for an amazing piece! 👏👏👏
Wow! How does he remember where all those peices and  tiny skrews go back?
That watch probably sold for about $220.00 in 1958!
Those watches are ugly.
As soon as I saw "58" GMT....got the popcorn and settled in. A grail watch for sure. So thankful you maintained the original look and patina. A true professional. Stunning!
So interesting,  but too many commercials
Great Video!  Very intriguing watching you do this level or restoration.  The detail and precision that you are exhibiting are amazing!
What you guys think about adding silicone grease/lubricant to the stem of the crown?  Any benefit or damage?
Hi, I've discovered your channel today, your vids are pure entertainment for me, thank you first and foremost! I have no deep knowlege about watches, but I have a genuine question, I would like to express first that its really just curiosity and in no way critique for I have the utmost respect for the lvl of quality of your work and videos in general. I've heard that especially on the Rolex brand the surface finish is a proof of making or sort of a determent if the watch even is real, don't those metal tweasers and screwdrivers leave marks on the movement parts that depreciate the value or am I generally misunderstanding this? Any help welcome I just want awnsers ^^
There was a wide range in value. What would you have valued this watch after restoration. How much value did it lose for refinished dial. I would have assumed when dial was refinished it would have been cleaned ? Wonder what ownwer did for work that he got it so dirty. Some background on the owner would have been welcomed. 5  stars 🌟
Do you ever sell some of the watches you work on?
great video, thankx
Your skills are impressive, to say the least. Not only the mechanical skill but the concentration, the steady hands, attention to detail, and the narration all combine to produce quality results that anyone can see. One issue, at least for me, is you make it look easy and it is anything but easy. A lot of hobbies or jobs are more about having the right tools but this one? The tools are important but without the mindset and skills to go along with them they may as well be paperweights.  Excellent job on both the watch and the video. 👍👍👍 I went looking for a salute emoji but can't find one so I salute you sir.
You have the perfect radio voice
Don't get it. It's ugly honestly. Wouldn't pay 2500 for it or any watch. Walmart 25 bucks. Works just as good. You could buy a house for the price they put on this. And the white parts are as yellow as my late grandpa's teeth were lol.
The Rolex engineering is phenomenal...as I watched you dissect the watch! Awesome video!!!
I love the Magic the Gathering play mat next to your work area.
Dude, just from watching this, I've got heart attack. You did an awesome job!
That looks like pressure cracking.
This was super dope!!!
This is so impressive.  Don't think I am going to do this.. But watching is GOOD and SAFE.
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT SPEND THAT MUCH ON SOMTHING SO SMALL ARE  BRAGGERS. CARS TOO BIG BOAT
My grandfather opened a school of horology (watchmakers school) in Phoenix az in about 1945 or 47.  He was also a jewelry and taught a lot of GIs after ww2.since the gi bill payed for their education.    I am 99.50% positive I have that watch in my box of old watches.  The only thing I don't know is if it is bakelite or a replacement.    I worked for my family's jewelry store my whole life....Indian jewelry.   My mom wasn't into fine jewelry in the 70s so after we sold our stores she managed a fine jewelry store and I was there on her days off..at least until she retired in 2020 at 82.   I have always said I can walk behind any counter at a jewelry store and start selling.  I've done it since I was 9 and I'm 57 now. I have thousands of dollars worth of watch  parts, stones, old pawn Indian jewelry and the supplies for my own work .   I'm an artist.   I wish I knew what this watch was worth, I would of got some extra parts from our rolex guy before he died.  Great guy. Have you heard this one.....? You know where to find a good watch maker? A cemetery.    That is changing thank heavens .   My grandpa always wanted to teach me to be a watchmaker but I was to busy chasing boys.  Big regret
It's the OGMT
Aren’t the hours luminous circles just as big as the Mercedes circle ?
How does restoration work like this affect the value?
First time here was brilliantly interesting lovely to watch and listen too take care
WOW!!  Incredible video.  How long did it take you to learn how to do this?
You did a fanatically 3on this watch
How and by whom was this old watch valued at the astronomical price of $100,000.00? Seems to me that these prices are simply pulled out of someone's azz.
Why you no check for cracked or broken jewels?
Why would you mess with it without protection if it's "highly" radioactive.
Amazing work
Well done !
Ain’t no way I’m getting into watch making lmao
Interesting….
Fantastic works!
Never cared about watches, but always cool to see a master mechanic at work 👍👍👍
I wonder if that crystal has such an odd distress pattern from decades of radium gas being trapped under it and bombarding it with radiation.
Explain to someone who has no skills in watch repair why rolex stop putting jewels into their watches or have they iv been lucky with being owner of a 21 jewel watch and not sure worth ..and does it have more worth ???
This dude is the modern day bob Ross
The watch was running before he removed the hands. Aligning the hands for removal seemed to wake it up.
All that work for a 10% better looking watch compared to before
What a turkey. If he is speaking the truth, as he knows it, then he knows nothing.
Can’t just wear actual gloves? Lmaoooo
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Just gifted my Rolex GMT to my son for his 50th birthday, I bought it in 1983 and it spent 25 years in a safe, only then did I get it out and wear it as my everyday watch, anyhow I was always aware of it's value as a vintage watch, despite only paying £ 850:00 GBP for it brand new. I had always said I'd let my son have it and the time came, I took it to a trusted watchmaker I knew ,who also had the same watch incidentally, and he like me was keen to keep it's age related patina and value. He fully cleaned and serviced it and gave me a current valuation of £13.000  13K GBP, not a bad investment, my son now has it and it's his everyday watch now, and funnily enough he is in the U.S right now for 6 months.
Id love to try stuff like this but i would take it apart and forget how ot goes back together 😂
I want to learn how to do that
Sub earned. Question. What does this do to its value? Say it’s worth 100k in its original damaged state….does replacing the band and other parts increase or decrease its value?
bro no way i would be able to mount this correctly even with ages of experience! So many pieces! Thats crazy, good video and loved the sunset!
At first i hear audioopera 😅
Question : how long does it take to learn to do that? I’m retiring in a couple years and I would love to do that as a hobby.
What a beautiful handicraft…. Amazing to see how happy the watch (and you😊) is coming to life..lovely
Sir, you are more than worth whatever you charge!
Really easy to describe you sir. You are a master at this! Wow!
Wow 👏.  That's some workmanship right there. 😊
A testament to the quality.  Great work.! Thank you for showing us laymen.!!
Fake
Refinished dial is huge hit to value …but still looks original
For any watch you're working on, when you reassemble it or do some work, are you referring to something like an assembly drawing, or is it just experience telling you what to do in what order?
Little sad that you replaced the crystal. The crack was so mesmerizing!
Awesome stuff! I’m hooked instantly! Where should I go to learn more about this?
Careful SpongeBob
There is no greater satisfaction than the satisfaction of a task done well
I would have so many pieces left over putting that back together…crazy…
Amazing  👏  This is so satisfying to look at your work and skills to be able to manage so many little pieces. I don't understand how you can handle and remind how to get back at the right place each of parts of this watch, fantastic !
Fantastic work, I have just found your videos and am a now a subscriber!
A little bit like Bob Ross. Satisfied. Good work. Bravo! 🎉❤ Love it
While watching; Normal people thinking : What a amazing detailed piace of art. The artist who made this must be very skillful. Atheist thinking: coincidence
What a stunning restoration. I can’t believe how great it looked inside and how well it was built I hope my modern day Rolex is built just as well. Fantastic job you will have made the owner very proud. 👍
By far the best videos on this stuff . Bravo
I have a golden rolex my father says that u boot kaptins they had in ww2 is that posible.
Does the bezel turn?"
Class work pal.
Good job 🙌 now send it to the nekkid watchmaker he can spruce it up like new 😇
It was pleasant to see your videos today. Watches and watch makers are extinct nowadays. 45 years back as a young village boy I wonder how a watch works.  Curious and fascinated on this big technology, I used to go to the only watch maker in our village and nearby to check what’s inside a watch machine. Now being a resident of Dubai, I visited my village in India recently. The whole village and the streets are changed beyond recognition. But that old one room Wach Maker Workshop made of mud  bricks is still exist there as remanence of yesteryear glory. It was a single man watch work shop had many foot print 6 decades ago at a place Yeroor village in Kerala state. When I saw your video, my thoughts gone though my childhood days.  As a curious boy on this time machine, once I opened my Dad’s watch to check what’s inside hidden behind the dial. My interest build up to be a wast maker then, but today am a business men, engineer in Electrical power Proj
You are very good at what you do here.  If I ever find an old valuable or semi-valuable watch, I am sending it into you for a fixer upper.   Take Care       Hot Rod
watched the entire thing, regret nothing
I wonder if there are torque specifications in reassembly. Imagine cross threading a screw!
How in the world do you remember what goes where??? Very impressive sir!
Fine work, congratulations
When you lose a grandparent, you really appreciate such heirlooms, especially one he probably wore every day for decades. Well done!
You should buy your own simpler domain (something similar to the channel), people won't remember such a obscure domain.
I'm wondering how often should you have your watch be serviced and how expensive would the watch be, to consider having it serviced.
Why the heck are/were watches expensive? I mean, it's A WATCH.
Loved this video
That pattern of fracture on the watch crystal is usually a sign of chemical alteration. So it was probably exposed something pretty nasty.
so good
its looking shit cleaning
I was going to type "you have the same voice of Marshall Sutcliffe from MTG", since I watch a lot of magic for a long time. and then I noticed the Magic playmat... and then you said your website is called sutcliffehansen and my mind was blown
Fascinating stuff and mad watch servicing and restoration skills on display here.
I think I've seen crystal get cracked like that by sun exposure, but I'm not completely sure. Regardless, excellent work.
Unbelievable how many parts there are  just putting all the screws there knowing we’re every single one is genius
Very impressive work.  Do you accept watches through the mail to work on?
That was fascinating!
I would not get five dollars for that watch
The price you claim for that watch is a BIG LIE. Try more honesty instead of false data.
So this is how true passion looks like....
Amazing . Wonder how much its worth
Hold my beer, I got this!!! Very impressive!👋👋👋
I am an engineer working in ship design and construction, these small gears (wheels) give me serious anxiety. Incredible how you are able to put it all back together. How do they even accurately made these small screws and gears in the fifties and result in a magnificent watch. Just mind boggling. Thank you for your videos, i fully enjoy them. p.s. do you have videos of how they made the small gears and screws in the past, i would love to see some old info on how they actually made the parts for these watches.
So back in 1958 Rolex had a factory to make all these dozens of beautiful precise microscopic components !? Wow. The Swiss were not only technical artists, but shrewd inventors with an eye for barriers to competitive entry.
New subsriiber here 🙏
The "born to fly" spring is also called the "Oh Jesus" clip. It's because that is what you say when it goes flying.
If I wanted to purchase this watch or one like it, what do you think it would cost? Thanks.
That was just beautiful too see, I'm blown away.  Cheers from the UK.
Nice to see a watch being worn but a quick wash under the tap and clean can prolong the look of it
Watching you is like watching Rembrandt paint one of his masterpieces.  Bravissimo.
How much would you charge to restore a Rolex 116900? It’s under warranty needs a new crystal and light polish?
Could watch these all day long!
Where can i get that spring bars tool? I like that it can turn in and out. Thanks
Good job
With my shakey hand , I'm not dare to hold the watch in my hands
Did I seriously just spend 50 minutes of my life watching a guy work on a watch.... yes, yes I did :)
0.0
What an amazing quality from Rolex, i see why they are so popular
Imagine if he started sneezing.. watched the whole thing it is very impressive..
I can't even imagine what you would charge to restore a watch like this... fantastic job.
good ol Radium Paint
If this watch get lost, you will certainly find it faster with a Geiger counter than a metal detector. By the way a absolute amazing watch
Outstanding. Truly magnificent. I will never be able to comprehend the value that these watches hold, but I am always breathtaken by the beauty of them. I suppose therein lies the answer. Either way, you have done a remarkable and bold thing, taking this piece onto your bench and treating it right. There is a due diligence that should be afforded to objects like this; ones that are redolent with history and life and value and meaning. I'm reminded of the Zen Buddhist tradition when watching this restoration. The meaning in the object is not in its perfection. It is in its imperfection, but yet its reverence. It is a timeless thing, ironically, and you handled this gorgeous watch with finesse and skill.
This video is satisfying very chill
You didn’t do much. I would’ve wanted more.
I just finally bought my first Tudor watch and I love it. I've always been a fan of the 1936-1946 shield and rose logo, and the 1947-1969 rose logo like on this watch. I really want to own a vintage Tudor some day, and, seeing how this one turned out, makes me want one even more. Very nice work.
Beautiful work!
you are such a great precising works! i wonder you still receive a watch for fixing? please let me know.
LOL. How exactly does one "curate" a tool kit?
I didn’t notice you replacing the gasket inside the replacement crown.
I would have have so many parts left over if I took this hobby in.
The tension this makes me feel!! Trying to repair an iPhone with a gun against my head!! PROPS😊
Absolutely Gorgeous!
I thought I recognized your voice from somewhere then i remembered where I’ve heard you before. I remember it from you doing coverage for magic the gathering
That is awesome!
What makes these so expensive?
Cannot believe you are just laying out the parts on your table....one misstep and they are all lost.     you need to really use small dishes with lids
Ohne Restaurierung und Nachweis bei Rolex ist die Uhr nichts wert.
Beautiful watch and beautiful work. This video was a pleasure Marshall. Keep up the great work!
Best de-stress YT channel, ever! Thank you so much for your passion and craftmanship! Kudos from Copenhagen, Denmark
As a Rolex owner, I was fascinated by your video.  It has pushed me to get my 1987 watch serviced.  I do have a question about how much torque should be used on all of the internal screws? All seem to be simply finger tight. How do you keep the screws in order?  Obviously your experience plays a big part.  I would never attempt to service my own watch, just curious.  I do do basic service though on my BMW motorcycle.  That's where the torque question comes from.  Again, thanks and well worth my time to watch.
You are a true Artist.
Which job do the jewels have? Sorry i am a mechanical engineer but I have no clue what the jewels do😅
Wonderful job, mate👍🙂
I had one from my grandpa. 1954. Too bad he told me not to keep it for more than a year, had to donate because that's what he wanted. At the end true what he said. its just a watch.
Yeah yeah sure found in drawer xD
Cleaning is ok, but replacing parts like the Crystal, collectors go Crazy 😂
I don't know why but I was in awe with the Rolex GMT being taken apart piece by piece the cleaned and put back together again
At first i was like i am totally down to start watch making as a hobby... but then you kept taking out pieces... and more pieces... and more pieces... and now i am totally down to watch you do this as a hobby...
Sûre the prince was 100000😅
too conservativ restoration
Thanks.  Really great post.  Minimal restoration to preserve the integrity of a great watch
I have loved watches and been an audiophile since I was 8 years old. I love precision things. Watching you is so engaging. The tools, the knowledge. That snap from the barrel being installed. It’s like the perfect trigger job on a 1911pistol. Just “snap” perfect. I wait for you to post new content daily. Thanks for giving us, the “type A” an outlet!!!!
Por favor, pare de falar demais e trabalhe. O senhor joga muita conversa fora. Quero ver a restauração.
Very nice success .
What a time to be alive to just have these types of videos readily available.
Awesome restoration , though I feel you could have went further at least on the bezel . it is a pleasure to watch you work. Because that means I don't got to find one and do it and then screw it up so bad I'd need you to put it back together anyway :)
When that Gieger counter started going off it made me want to wear a MOPP gear 😂
Nice work,but one thing has been missed up on this particular watch restoration. The watch case was not been polished,or buffet at all, during to the entire restoration proces..?
I don't get it. This is just a 1958 watch, nothing unique or remarkable to me. Another relatively new radioactive watch with an inflated price.(
just "WOW!"
Another fantastic job. Well done.
Why the hell would you buy something for $100,000 if it only tells time and maybe a few other things it can do
Marshall is a master of his craft
My mother gave me a Bulova wristwatch that was her engagement present from my father during WWII. It has 6 rubies, 3 on each side of the face (made of rose gold). It doesn't run and I would like to have it restored. Do you do restoration work on old Bulovas?
before and after ...ha ha ha ha...true the difference is a joke ...even our local watchmaker  may be able to do this
As the proud original owner of a 1976 GMT Master, I was extremely interested in watching you go through the restoration of this vintage model.  And, did I happen to catch a glimpse of a GMT Master on your right wrist while you were working??!!!  My watch was a college graduation present from my parents back in 1976 and it set my folks back $425.00 at the time, still have the receipt.  In approximately 2010 when the band broke, I sent it in to Rolex for a band replacement, crystal replacement, bezel replacement, cleaning & gasket replacement.  Total repair cost was $1,650.00, 4x what the purchase price was.  And that’s been my only expense on it in 47 years!!  Rolex, tha gift that keeps on giving!!
test yourself and tools for radium leakage.
960 CPM. Not great, not terrible.
Wow 3.8 million views the watch industry is alive and well
You must be happy fixing a watch that even Rolex didn't want to attempt to fix.
As someone whos never done this before or even seen a Rolex irl, I can safely say, thats exactly how I wouldve done it.
Can you do a service on my Huawei Band 7? I guess its crystals need a bit of oiling and cleaning meow.
so nice
When you got the watch completely disassembled with that cluster of loose, irreplaceable parts in front of you, the first thing I imagined was the grandchild dashing into the room and releasing an inflated balloon, forcefully propelling itself across your workstation 'for your entertainment'. I actually experienced mild chest pains of my own on your behalf 🙂. Thank You for sharing such unique and interesting videos ... your expertise and patience are certainly uncommon. Much Respect To You, Sir.
The dial is so clean! Great job!
I didn't know that about the Mercedes hand😂❤ beautiful work and knowledge about the watch. 😊
Besides the Rothchilds who can afford a 100k watch
20k-30k no where near $100K
My experience is with firearms.  Having a magnet handy is a great way NOT to lose fasteners. (unless magnetism is a issue for watches)
I cannot believe I just spend 52 min watching you restore a watch and I enjoy every minute. unbelievable talent.
The crystal was likely exposed to something like a freon spray or other chemical that reacted with the acrylic.  The chemical caused the acrylic to distort and generate internal stress so great that the crystal cracked.
What a wonderfully narrated video.  Out of curiosity, what is your eyesight and/or what optics do you use?  I am VERY nearsighted, but I enjoy working with my hands and they're pretty steady - I'm considering this as a hobby, but need to dig a little more.  For reference, when I say nearsighted, my glasses lenses are -12.  I can't see anything that's not an inch or two in front of my face clearly.  So I'd have to be REAL close to these parts when working, and I'm concerned I might breathe one away.
While I'm fascinated with your videos and obvious talent I have to question your reasoning for the Mercedes logo for holding the lume in place, the indices are also round and hold the lume in place
Marshal from Magic commentary right??
You just earned a new subscriber but honestly you really deserve a million more just from this video.   Good work brotha 😎
How much is cost to make the maintenance on a Rolex ?
#beaglepatch
addictive watching  super steady hands
Wow. Just wow.
You must it up you changed the bracelet and isn't the glass  made of sapphire crystal  material  then the new one you change the value
How you kept track of everything with numbers or trays or such was truly amazing
Mister you are a watch repair genius! That is absolutely amazing!
can you wear a watch that is radioactive like that?
I don't understand why I don't see a watchmaker open the rear case and then drop the entire thing in a solvent and ultrasonic cleaner to remove dried grease and gunk.  Then a penetrating oil bath.  Seems that would let everything release easier, to be cleaned again and properly lubricated.  But I'm not a watchmaker.  I'm just curious.
Makes me vape DMT and to be thankful to be Ojibway.......decent vid
Exceptional watch, skillful jeweler repairing it.  I want a Rolex even more now!  Thank you.
Why do we call it crystal if it’s actually a type of acrylic?
Odds the original owner died of wrist cancer?
Absolutely beautiful watch and work. Thank you for this video. Thank you for the education as you went along. First time seeing something like this. Amazing.
How much did you spend in parts?
Great work!
Great job. Amazing.
Why does he wear the finger things instead of a full latex glove?
Enjoy your narrative, didn’t even fall asleep !
That was so awesome.
No words!! Love watching you work.
Wow wow wow What a terrific restoration  Brilliant watch
This is like watching a surgeon at work.
Uhhhhh doesn't the bezel have radium?
Thank you
In my grandfather's cupboard there was a funny green cylinder on a stick, a red arm band with a funky windmill and a old photo of Charlie Chaplin
It isnt a Rolex any more without Rolex parts
Are you an official Rolex jlr?
I didn't take a full breath until that bezel was clicked back in.  I'm so impressed!
You have nerves of steel ... that is some badass watch restoration!
Amazing work ❤
With that price tag the watch should be able to repair itself!
Amazing ! Nice job on this watch, and i’m super impressed on the parts, and how they might have been made! Thanks for
Fantastic!!!!!! Gorgeous watch
Great video Marshall. I religiously listen to Limited resources and have done so since around 2015 just before the start of Luis's Tenure.  I had not looked at this channel before but since you spoke about it on the podcast with such reverence i thought id have a look. My granddad was a watchmaker and I didn't really know him well and this was a pleasure to watch. Thankyou.
Excellent skill & commentaries. What’s the total cost of restoration?
I'm a Retired Military Armorer (I fixed the guns), and this really satisfied my mechanical inclinations. That was gorgeous.
Where can I like this video twice ?
I just barely caught a glimpse of your own vintage GMT Master “Pepsi” on the wrist.. the bezel has a beautiful pinkish tint to it.. very beautiful piece sir.. pleasure watching this restoration of an icon in the 6542
great work
I think this is 19:52 why the owner of the watch trusted him to do this job. 🤗
still dirty for me
So is the bezel permanently seized?  I notice you didn’t try turning it after you reassembled it…
3:45 in the morning,time to watch this random watches restoration video
👍👍
Hello there just found your channel.  I've got a 59 mens rolex oyster that belonged to my father.  I've been trying to find out what it's worth but haven't found much information other than the $1200 they say most old rolex's are worth.  Although it's an oyster were on the watch face doesn't match up with oysters I've seen online.  I'm hoping it rair but haven't got a clue.  Can you help me out with this problem?
Fantastic video
how does a restoration like this impact the value of the watch?
I'm growing a tentacle just watching this! Heard some horror stories about Radium lumens and careless horologists....
Wow what a watch thank you love your channel so relaxing and informative:)
Need to improve
Why do the hands look so beat up? I would think they don’t ever contact anything.
Rolex factory service here in Beverly Hills says they switched to a new oil lasting 10y now, whereas the old oil lasted maybe 5 before turning to goo. Can you please comment on the selection of your lubricants and how they compare to factory spec? Also, is wear on the wheels and other parts formally measured in a factory service and replaced if out of spec? Thanks for a great vid.
The crystal does not appear to be glass. It looks like a synthetic plastic. Did Rolex use a different material in 1958? Acrylic or polycarbonate? BTW Bakelite is phenolic as far as I am aware. Thanks for a great vid. Please do an Air King :-)
Why can't i ever find 100k in a random drawer?
Coooooooool!
Spectacular video. Thanks for sharing your journey. I learned a lot.
I can't imagine me doing anything near this, with my sausage fingers.
I sat mesmerized watching you work.  You are amazing!  How you handle SO many tiny parts is a mind blower.  I would have to label each tiny part and take pictures of where each came from and I would still be frozen with fear.  You are a true master!
Mantab
Amazing watch. I love vintage watches. If you ever need Tiny luminous markers like 1mm I make them with C3 watch grade lume. I can also make them in any color.
This crystal looks like it got a lot of UV lighting maybe it was displayed but ten you'd think it would have been cleaned.
I have been wearing a 1998 GMT Master for decades now, and can only hope some talented watchmaker will do the same for mine when I am gone.
Without a doubt the best watch restoration video I have ever seen.
Just a thought: you often mention how scary it is for things like a yoke spring to fly away, never to be found again. How about a Plexiglas enclosure to place over the watch you're working on, large enough to have holes to allow your two arms to enter to do that one scary bit of work.
i really enjoy watching your content, if possible please, I have a Rolex 18956 that needs restoration can you help?
Beautiful! Found your channel from another YouTuber Harrison Elmore.
After watching this video I can fully understand what makes them so expensive. How the hell does Rolex make all those inner parts that when all put together work perfectly for years. Now I get it. Thank you Sir for the free education.
Ah, yes. Cleaning an ultra-rare bezel of a 65 year old, $100,000 Rolex GMT with a toothbrush. I love it.
Letting him do the restoration is deranged but I'm here for it
What an amazing comeback this watch piece had!
You've come a long way Marshall! Been watching you a few years now and I'm excited for you to get a grail like this on your bench!
That thing is a horrible condition piece of crap.
I am curious if you could take the original crystal and  1) clean up the discoloration (yellowing) by lightly sanding the crystal like is done to remove the yellow for old headlights.  2) bath the entire crystal in some UV setting resin in a vacuum to get the resin to penitrate the cracks 3) then before exposing to UV cleaning in the excess off the crystal. Essentially filling the cracks similar to a windshield repair.   Just a thought. I use a vacuum chamber for similar projects, but never on a watch crystal.  Beautiful video, I am seriously considering getting your kit, but I need to see if I have time for another hobby on top of Beekeeping, Machining, Wood working, and Firearms...
this time next year, Rodney....
I’m not a mechanically inclined person, but as a watch enthusiast, I found myself drawn to this. Fascinating and therapeutic. Great commentating, learned a lot!
Unbelievably awesome find and service!! Would you recommend keeping a watch like this in a auto winder when not worn in order to keep that movement moving? I have 3 (automatic) watches in rotation, one of which is a circa 1990 16610 Sub/Date. I don't keep it in a winder when not worn and I was wondering if I should be doing that. Not just for that watch but also my Panerai Carbotech as well as my Seiko Diver.
You’ve done a fantastic job in getting this beautiful watch running again, as shown when you measured the accuracy etc. I think though ,given its very high value, I’d have been tempted to send it back to Rolex with strict instructions for a sympathetic restoration. I know this would have been very expensive, although still only a small percentage of the value, but they supply a new certificate of authenticity and a service card etc. That would assist massively to enable it to be insured and valued. That said I’m sure the owner is delighted . How beautiful to be able to wear and enjoy this watch as often as possible 👏👏👍
A hmt in future?
amazing
Stunning work 👌🏻
⌚👍
If I ever need brain surgery I choose you. Very impressive work.
How do you remember which screw goes where.
Marshall...have you received any inquiries from disabled Vets to do this kind of work as a hobby?
Very impressive, and a great job on the video as well. Just think of all the engineering and craftsmanship that went into designing and manufacturing this watch. It takes a lot of experience and the right tools to work on them too. If I'd try to fix something like this those little screws would be history :-o
Amazing!
Same time period, the original m16 was made from bakerlite.
Absolutely superb - and respectful - restoration of this classic.  Thank you once again for sharing!  A big 👍🎉❤  up from the 🇬🇧  and very best wishes for 2024.
Like a movie thriller, I was audibly ooh-ing and aah-ing throughout. 😆 As an engineer, this has opened up an entirely new world for me. I'm deepdiving!
great video , enjoyed it, just shame about the dial , lets the watch down a lot
Great JOB !!!
Awesome awesome awesome
I'd have to film myself just to know what went where when reassembling it
This is neurosurgery
Gorgeous timepiece
Thanks!
It’s also amazing that in 1960 they could make something like this let alone have service guys who could work on something like this
This is soo fascinating to me. I know how to work on cars and for example you may not and cars may seem intimidating to you. But having 100 little parts and just throwing them in a bin to get cleaned seems intimidating to me 😂 seems like it could never go back together! But great video, really really cool
All those tiny, irreplaceable parts — DON’T SNEEZE!  How can you possibly remember which part goes where?  Reminds me of taking apart a radio as a kid … but I could never get it back together.  What amazing work you do. What a job. What a life!  Huge props, watch man!  😺❤️
Radium and asbestos sounds like a fun restoration
Do you think there's any chance that it cracked that way due to all the radiation Plus the age?
Amazing!! You have an incredible skill... It's really fun to watch😊
I was trying to get my 1yo to lie down for bed last night and I turned on you fixing that sears watch for Clint. She sat down, got quiet and just watched until she went to sleep. I haven’t gotten into the hobby yet but I watch your videos all the time. My 10 and 5 yo used to sit on the couch and watch with me. My 5yo came in the room last night and said “yay! It’s time to fix a watch!”. Just wanted to lyk you’re doing more than just teaching us. You’re even getting our kids minds more mechanically interested
Best narrator's voice of all time. Your voice, humor, and wit make the video!
Excellent work. Excellent watch. Excellent presentation.
Hey, quick question..  Wouldn't you want an organizing mat or some kind of organizing containers to keep the pieces in?
Woah! Just listened to the limmies episode. Luis wasn’t kidding! Congrats on the successful channel. You got a new subscriber     :)
That watch killed grandpa.  radiation
The crystal is most certainly made from acrylic. And acrylic will spider crack like that is cleaned with IPA (isopropyl alcohol).
Absolutely enjoyed. Learned alot from your work. Thank you.
Incredible work sir, and this watch is actually radioactive which is even more incredible ! Never ever expected this from... any watch :O
Amazing.It always takes me 15-20 tries to get the hands lined up and spaced properly.You make everything look so effortless.Great Work!!
People are fascinating and incredible.Are you kidding me with that restoration? Really impressive.
Not sure how this popped up on my video feed but fascinating and amazing to see the craftsmanship that goes into the Rolex. Your restoration work Sir is absolutely amazing to see! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 very detailed explanations!!!  I have now subscribed to your channel!
achievement unlocked
You really outdid yourself this time! A very interesting video about a VERY beautiful watch! Checked out your website, very nice, followed you on IG, and liked the video (was a subscriber on the channel already), just as every one of us should do! Again, thank you for going through this beautiful watch, keep'em coming! Kamran
Lovely, that dial does look later, very much like the 'Maxi Mk5' style GMT dial.
Way to many commercials
What a work of art, amazing restoration to this icon!!! 🎨🔥❤️
Magic The Gathering playmat on the side, got to love him.
im sure my cats would LOVE for me to get into watch making as a hobby lol jump up and knock all those teeny tiny screws all over the place lol
I will never stop being amazed at how watchmakers and clockmakers 60 or even 160 years ago were able to make machines so precise in their layout and function. Has anybody in these comments ever had a peek at what *_electronics_* looked like just a little over 60 years ago? Before the commercialization of the printed circuit board and the solid-state transistor, electronics were such an absolute mess of wires and components flapping in the breeze - in devices the size of toasters or fridges or entire rooms - that it's kind of crazy that they managed to function at all. And I say this as someone who works in electronics. Sure, some *_65 years_* after this Rolex was put together, we have CAD, microlithography, wave-soldering, and printed circuit boards with multiple layers, and machines built with these tools that are able to perform timekeeping and calculations on a nanosecond scale... but, it's still so awe-inspiring how people managed to build such precise mechanical timekeeping devices on the scale of a silver dollar so many decades ago. I think back to the late 1700s and 1800s when people were fooled by The Turk, a supposed clockwork-based chess-playing computer, and I can hardly blame them.
Wow, almost 6.5 uSv/h from the radium on that watch is crazy, that thing is definitely not to be worn daily
Not sure if he mentions this, but that dial is definitely not correct.
The final shot of that gorgeous watch made me weep!
Why You never polish the watch case? Don't You think more pro?
What do you normally charge for this level of service?
Не когда это модель столько не стоила !! Зачем пиздеть !!
She's a stunner.
Well done Sir! You always do outstanding restorations. So with the new crystal and a refinished face does that dramatically reduce the value below the $100,000 mark? I just subscribed great channel!
Kudos for your great videos, commitment to restore these beauties and for M:tG pad also :)  Good thing is that you do not sneeze during the process!
Splendid upload
Lol i am flabbergasted by the amount on the Geiger meter. Didnt expect that at all!!
what does a restoration like this cost?
Question. Did you do this over time or in one sit? Awesome work fantastic watch. The family will be happy
id buy that watch its beautiful
gorgeous journey. huge fan of gmt as i've traveled my entire life. cheers! major thx!
The case needed more scrubbing, especially in the bezel O ring groove and rear case cover groove.  Same thing with the O ring seating area inside the case.  Clearly the ultrasonic didn't get all the grunge mobilized, and having that material remain in the gasket areas can degrade the water tight integrity.
I've never put anything together more complicated than a PC. This is insane :D  I would go crazy trying to remember where all those tiny parts go.
Do you use greases that are already really pigmented or do you color them yourself for organization and visibility?
Just a quick question. What type of magnifier do you use, as you seem to be able to place screws etc from a great distance? I have to bend right over the work using 15 or 20 X magnification ???
Is a restoration priced at a standard rate or does it vary depending on the value of the watch?

Incrível restauração, desse Rolex, mas será que é mesmo, $100,000 dólares?
Got a good question has anyone bought a timex harborside automatic? Price is under 200 and it looks pretty sweet!
Just wow! Thank you for this video. Regards
Sooner or later this guy will restore a patek grand complications.
goodness, so many wheels, how do you remember which order and where to put it all back??
This is very Therapeutic!! Great job.
Very nice. thank you!
So satisfying to watch, kind therapy
Interesting the hands were not cleaned and the body wasnt buffed out?
This is cool!!! How do you remember which screw goes where?
Does the bezel spin? I watched the whole thing and you never spun yhe bezel. I love the video; freaking amazing!
ive got to say this guys voice sounds like the guy that casted the MTG pro tour am i crazy?
Being the engineers daughter, I love to tinker fixing things and you are an inspiration! And BTW, my grandfather had one of these!
I’m so impressed, nice job.
Great piece..and fantastic resto 👍🏻
I remember this exact watch. Carried it up my hole when I did the Amazon expedition back in 1976. Served me well!
I don't want to work on watches, but watching passionate people doing what they love is always a joy. Thanks for the video.
What is so exciting? Old junk imho.
That was a great video! What was the most expensive watch you've serviced, Marshall? Greetings from Brazil! =)
I’m interested in a ball park price for what you just did on this? Amazing work!
If I took a watch apart like that I’m fairly certain would have left over parts on reassembly!
Amazing work done to a stunningly beautiful watch👍
Awesome video! I was actually on the edge of my seat during parts of this!
I'm 8 minutes in and I'm baffled by the fact he hasn't used any sort of lubrication whether it be aero-kroil to loosen parts, or some sort of alcohol or degreaser for the dirt.  Must be a reason no liquids are used when restoring a watch huh?
Cool
Is it just me or is the magnification on the new crystal stronger than on the old one?
how much did it cost for the restoration? Do you also have the backstory of the watch?
Very cool video. What is the spelling of the ‘adult silly putty’ mentioned at 39:27?
Never had a watch like this, all my watches from the 50ies are nearly brand new!!! 😎👍🇦🇺
At 7:18 the case back reads II 1958 which is the way Rolex denotes the quarter and the year the watch was manufactured. In this case it is Q2 of year 1958.
A true master at your craft !!
My grandfather was a watchmaker in a small town in central Turkey in the sixties and repaired watches. I used to help him in my school holidays. One day a rich man brought his Omega watch to get repaired. My grandfather saw an automatic watch for the first time and as he realized how it works, the old man started to dance in his little (2 x 3 meters ) repair shop! I don’t forget that day.
You're a master!
WOW! 👏🏻
Well done, thanks for a beautiful video.
RE radiation: CPM (counts per minute) is a bit misleading where it comes to the danger level of the radioactive material (yes, I know its radium, and am aware of its history as well as the modern millennial scaremongering regarding radium dials, fiestaware, etc. Im speaking about general nuclear radioactivity knowledge, calm down sparky...). Its literally trigger instances of the detector. The static coming off your body could trigger a 'count'. Also, depending on what the sensor is made to detect, it could be effectively harmless alpha, it could be low energy beta, or high energy beta, or gamma.....it doesnt say. Its just a 'count'. And counts DO NOT IN ANY WAY directly relate to the important measurements of radiation, the important ones to pay attention to is RAD and the REM. Radiation Absorbed Dose, and Roentgen Equivalent Man. Those directly measure the damage done by being exposed to harmful radiation. Counts, Becquerels, Curies ONLY MEASURE ATOMIC EVENTS!!!! And are effectively useless for determining damage to your person without knowing anything more about the type of radiation, beyond displaying that there is an atom undergoing radioactive decay. And there are tons of those naturally around and in you right now, all the time. Beware news outlets that use Becquerels, because they're scaremongering.  WR, on the other hand was demonstrating that there was radioactive material on the watch, and thus is not a scaremonger. However, with the nuclear radiation misinformation out there, I had to infodump yall.  Oh, by the way, 6 uSv (microsieverts, or 0.006 millisieverts ) is the equivalent of 2 days in Denver, CO. Ergo, remember kiddies, its neat when it beeps, but making it go ticky ticky ticky doesnt inherently mean itll make you sicky sicky sicky. Just....ya know....if your meter makes noise pay attention to it because its trying to tell you something worth knowing.....
I haveTourettes, how do I get started repairing Rolex Watches?
I watched this entire video while listening to: Toy Story 2 Soundtrack - 14. The Cleaner on repeat...
I found one simular on a skip I think mine is too far broken to fix
be careful whilst working with radium and the other radioactive elements because older dried out paints containing them can form radioactive duct if they are scratched
I love the proportions of these vintage GMTs. Anyone have any idea why modern GMTs are so much bigger and thicker? Is it because modern movements require extra parts for accuracy (COSC certification)?
❤
Thanks so much for the great videos! I love watching them! There are 2 things that you are not aware of, and I wouldn’t expect you to. The first is that the case back is stamped with a Roman numeral 2, meaning that at least the caseback was (allegedly) produced during the 2nd quarter of 1958. The second thing is that you are missing a VERY important piece of this watch (part number 1030 7005-1 Intermediate sole plate for self winding mechanism). Here is the information copied directly from a Rolex service manual: “Rotor Unit Repairs This calibre has not been made for several years and was replaced by calibre 1530-1575. There are however substan- tial numbers of movements of this type still used today and in some early production models a correction is advisable. The sole for self-winding mechanism, part #7005 with is made of brass, and the reversing wheels, part #7018 also brass, provide a bad friction surface resulting in signs of excessive wear. This problem was remedied in the course of production and the great majority of calibre #1030 movements have a steel sole spacer, part #7005-1 (not illustrated in material catalogue). This part which is available from the Rolex Material Division is inserted over the sole and provides a complete solution to the problem. After having added the sole spacer, it is necessary to readjust the endshake of the intermediate rotor wheel part #7021 since it will have been increased by an amount equal to the thickness of the spacer.” Much love!
This is completely fascinating! I love little detailed things like this!
I try to figure how much money he spent to buy this watch. 20k ? Maybe he is paid only for the restoration. After restoration that could be a huge pluvalue. Well done !
I haven't watched your channel for a while now and I'm super impressed by the tool ungrades and sharing your knowledge with others..
Now I am shocked. We had the exact same watch at our house. We didn't know exactly who wore it but it was always there. We knew it was rolex but didn't pay much attention. I used to wear it as fun while I was in 5th grade. One day I wore it and went playing, I took it off and forgot about it. I returned home and remembered after few days that I lost it. Theh shouted two or three times. Now that I've shown them this video, they literally started cursing:)  Oh yeah I used to rotate the bezel, it made a clicking sound. I don't know about now
😮amazing piece of overrated garbage.
吞口水_差评。
Wow! This is my first comment on one of your videos, but I just had to say it... WOW. (again)
Women that used to paint with iridium ended up with what ended up as cancer... crazy
Very cool watch, is there a serial number on these watches  ?
So mesmerizing!!! I can’t even imagine putting all the pieces back together 😳
How people let their watches get so crudy is beyond me. Grosses me out. Clean your damn watches once in a while.
Workers used to lick the paintbrush as they painted the watches with radium paints. Sadly, many died of horrible cancer.
Why is this so interesting? Im at the edge of my seat over here!
Nice
It’s beautiful but I won’t pay that kind of money a get a Tudor gmt Pepsi for 4500❤️
Amazing job and is so satisfying watching you being so passionate and absolutely loving the work that you do! Hats off to you sir! 👏🏻🙌🏻
Зачем, а главное нах*я?
Wow absolutely amazing, well done sir 👏👏👏
happy with this. this is priceless.
feels like it was in the ground for many years
I watched 52:25 min of this massive scam and there is still zit zitoune in the watch ? Give me the hour back pls
What was going on while it was on their wrist all those years... I would say a tumor with all that radiation
Beautiful you are an artist
How much to restore something like that?  $5k?
man, what the hell? That crystal looked amazing why did you change it?
At first, it seems like you have jumpy hands, until you take into account the size of the miniscule screw you hold with those tweezers that could be bent if used the wrong way.
Great video. I would really love to see a cosmetic restoration too. Happy new year !
Wonderful watch (and i don't like watches without numbers on the dial) and terrific job. I'm wondering why you didn't spent some time to look for an used end link. That bracelet had a fantastic patina. In any case you have my full admiration.
You sound like Neil DeGrasse Tyson
I'm blow away by the level of complexity hidden under a watch. This is f* great and unbelivable
Thanks Marshall i cant tell you how great it is i found you on here. I started following rare and expensive watches and your videos came up.  So im hooked on viewing them and really enjoy learning by following you.  Im seriously thinking of getting serious about learning this art form.  My dad has a beautiful timex self winding time piece that i assume uses weights that somehow wind the clock as it moves.  Id love to take it apart and clean it and inspect it for worn part needing replacement.  I want to ask you how much it might cost to get the special tools to get started.  Cleaning machine, press, special tools for winding springs and oiling parts, etc.  Please get back to me i really enjoy doing this type of fine and skilled work its an art form to work on these amazing mechanical wonders.  Now i know why Einstein was a patten clerk there in Austria he loved these mechanical works of art.  Let me know about kits and the various tools i need to get started.  Thanks Marshall
Polyethylene the most common type of plastic made, was first invented in 1933.
That crystal damage looks like it was caused by the radiation
Amazing. However.. the face isn't centered with the bezel! It's a few degrees off. :|
Wonderful video and education.  Thank you!
very nice job by a master !
Hey Marshall I see you are still at it with  the wonderful content. I have not watched any videos in a long time but what a way to return with an absolute masterpiece 👏🏽🙌✨️🤌🏽👌🏽 thank you.
Watch is great.  But radiation on it is crazyy
Incredible video, this just answered all of my questions and curiosities. This is something I would love to know more about, just being able to have the knowledge to look at a Rolex and understand what makes it tick. Incredible amount of history in this watch! Thanks for this wonderful video.
Beautiful.
🥰🤑👏👏👏
Love your videos so much! Content is riveting and your voice/delivery is perfection! SO much better than 100.2% of the crappy “content creator”(🙄) voices out there now😒  😎👍👍👍  …..  (I know I was already subscribed…not sure why I had to resub!🤔🤷🏻‍♂️)
am i crazy or have you started outsourcing your editing? something feels different about the pacing
Very shocking to see the start of it and then the beautiful restored result. Question: what did you do to avoid radium getting off the dial and hands?   Interesting to learn there was bakelite used in the past.  pls eloborate a bit on the radium/radioactivity issue. i was really amazed you work with it in an open environement.
That cracking on the crystal almost looks like rot/heat damage? Crazy
Really dig that bakelite bezel insert; but, I think I'd have saved that and put a different insert in so as to be able to wear that gorgeous piece w/o fear of breaking an irreplaceable piece. Saving it in a lockbox, for sure, to have provenance. OUTSTANDING work Marshall !!
That is a lot of pieces inside the watch, i didn't know it had that much stuff "Amazing"
Gorgeous
Great video, how accurate was the movement?
Phenomenal video! 😊
Cant find Your website...can you give us a addresse plz...thnx.....amaizing work...
I’m retiring from law enforcement in 2 years. I want to buy a submariner. Used and my budget, as a retired sheriffs deputy, would not need a perfect, all papers ect. Where should I look for one? Thank uou
I am always amazed by your very, very good videos. You really have great skills. Perfect. Watching the video made me feel peaceful. I'm happy hhh I applaud your ability and sense to maintain the vintage look without damaging it.
Awesome work. This is the reason why I want to learn this dying craft.
Man if you wanted you could have been a surgeon
Выглядит, как обычный ремонт.
Weird as it may sound, the narration, especially during re-assembly, almost feels like I'm listening to the British coronation or some other Royal event 😅
I will never be able to fit all that stuff back in together. Never. Great job !
52 minutes in total trance watching this video. Your skill is awesome! Now I do understand a little bit why theses things are so expensive.
I can't believe this channel existed and I didn't know about it. This is like a dream come true, listening to someone explain every detail about watches' inner workings.  BTW, the person narrating has a voice tone and a cadence that rivals a news anchor's.
The watch is almost as beautiful as the Apocalypse Hydra playmat.
Working person's watch. Faithful, dependable, ever-present, and subjected to just horrible conditions... but if they're well-made like an older Rolex, they'll just keep on ticking no matter how many licks get thrown at them
100,000$ watch, 10$ crystal
How, just how do you remember or keep track of where every screw, wheel and such goes?
Watching it at 2x looks much better
Watched entire video!
If I had a deconstructed watch in front of me I think It would take me years to figure out how to put it together...or maybe never.
Now i'm confused, I was always told the way you tell a fake rolex from a real one is that a real onee has a smooth, not ticking, second hand motion.  That's gone out of the window!
I am so impressed how delicate and nimble you are with those screws that you can’t hardly see and the parts that could easily be broken.  Amazing hobby.
Genious who designed it, and geniuos who cleaned it
Do you ever sneeze??
The cracking of the plastic lens is caused by a solvent such as toluene or xylene or even something more common.
Things that scare me here: Steel tweezers on brass parts including the movement main plate. Tape and pliers to remove a crown. Steel screwdrivers being used to remove bridges. Steel screwdrivers being used to move springs (you can literally watch scratches forming in the brass as you move the clutch spring). Not securing the movement as you pry the hands off. Had to stop watching but I'm sure there's more...
You sir are awesome! Very informative and satisfying video!
Gorgeous watch and a well done restoration.
Хороший ремонт, но не реставрация.
Thanks from mother and son in PA
Can you talk about your camera setup? Great editing with macro shots being just right.
Amazing work.
🎉 yeaaah SkinCrust! 🎉
This was so incredible to watch and to see each step of the process, loved it!
Good job, but way too much talking....
We don't find 58 Rolex's in the junk drawer at my house.  LOL
Just happened upon this video and recognized the voice instantly. Been a Marshal fan through MTG for years and am only now realizing how popular you are in this arena as well. What a treat and congratulations!!
Beautiful
I would have kept the orignal crystal, you can still tell the time through the cracks, and boy do those cracks tell their own story and show how much the watch passed through.
Chào anh. Em ở Việt Nam a có thể tặng 1 chiếc đồng hồ được không.
Dude!!! I’m hooked. You actually got me into the watch scene. Just ordered some stuff to start my own journey as well. Thank you for the dedication 🙏🏼
Amazing video!
your videography is amazing gas the watch itself... hats off!
Isn't anything over 150 CPM is dangerously radioactive?
Fun fact: The original owner died of wrist cancer.
I love watching your videos.  I like to know how things work (I was the bane of my father's existence since I liked to take things apart to see how they worked) and your vids have been very informative.
You can't afford a watch like this...yet!
The watch movement was working right after you wound it with the stem in it……
the cracks are called crazing in acrylics
I prefere to buy a new one 😂😂😂❤ I am in love with your beautiful hands 😘💕💕💕
This dude is challenged tbh
Not a criticism, just asking. How much value was lost on this piece by you doing the work instead of Rolex? No matter how well done, that’s why I said not a criticism
And I thought pew parts were intricate lmao! Respect man!
I Enjoyed your channel I have an old Rolex Submariner that is not working I believe it is from 1950's time frame would love to get it working again it has passed down the family line. Would like to connect with you to get your opinion on how old it is
Outstanding works ❤❤❤
I love that you have the exact same cleaning machine my father used (that I know have)  Ive only seen 2 machines with my own eyes. My dad's and my grandfather's machines.  Its awesome to watch your videos and see the old machine working as intended. Your machine is the 3rd one ive ever seen.
Curious, what does it cost to restore a watch like this?
They did Pepsi's back in 58 that's crazy I thought they were more modern colour ways
I would've kept the original crystal.
That dial was incredible for its age and use. Lucky owner indeed. Great work 👍🏻
That Green stuff is dried sweat .
Off subject, though considering bakelite becoming brittal with age. Your encounter with the stuff presents a second factor that I cannot relate to: the roadium paint. There could be undwanted reactions to a process I have learned from others that share a different hobby than time pieces, though both trades share tools, and one can tell other makers from each other by the quality of their workmanship that went into each piece they produced. I like the thrill of the hunt for firearm accesseies from a certian ventage that are no longer imported to the US. One can find Kalashnikov patteran magazines at shows or even pawn shops; they are rare—not as rare as that watch—but being produced during the Cold War, the Soviets, to save weight and keep material costs down, began to produce them from bakelite instead of the original blued steel. Well, as it turns out, and as you know, bakelite magazines become brittle with age. This is not a complete reversal of the dammage but rather a treatment and a stoppage of the progression that ultimately causes failure of the part. First, clean any oil from handling, storage, and solvents in a light detergent like Dawn dish soap (I like the new blue Gain's sent over Dawn as I prefer G-96 to the common CLP, I digress) and hot water. This process is important because next we are going to "rehydrate" the bakealite by submerging the whole affected piece that has become brittal in mineral oil. Time in the oil varies from piece to piece due to service history, storage, and handling conditions, but once cleaned, bakealite is a lot like a dry piece of wood, nature, or a tool with a wood handle that needs a "drink of oil" like we use lotion to rehydrate our skin in the dry winter months. Maybe you can acquire a suitable, but invalued, sample of the correct treatment and near ventage to do your own testing on, and hopefully this sudgested method bears fruit and brings you value in your hobby as it has mine. Who knows, it could become a thing that you can share for others to learn and help preserve the aging Bakalite items they encounter in their hobbies too. Merry Christmas, as the clock has passed twelve here in the Ozarks, and have a happy new year.
My father in law was a PanAm pilot and passed up buying one for I think $150. 😢😢😢
I would need a bigger computer to do this - to hold all the pictures I would have to take to be able to put it all back together again.
you talk too much much .ufffffff
I'm still trying to figure out why there so expensive, the insides of that watch look very similar to the insides of others he's worked on..I guess a person just believe there a great time piece..idk
I love watching you work on them, but the sheer quantity of parts gives me anxiety. The screws alone…😬
The level of un clean this still is, makes it infuriating to watch.   The whole watch still looks like a biohazard covered in gunk 🤮
Beautiful
Not perfeck
oh my, oh my... This is like... the '54 sunburst Stratocaster but for Watches... love it.
I clicked out of curiosity just to see what happens and ended up hitting the subscribed ! It baffles my mind how people could figure out all the interactions of the movements with each other to achieve the desired outcome ! Just brilliant !
I clicked out of curiosity just to see what happens and ended up hitting the subscribed ! It baffles my mind how people could figure out all the interactions of the movements with each other to achieve the desired outcome ! Just brilliant !
So many tiny parts!
I really enjoyed this video! Thank you  so much for taking me along on this journey with you!
Man you are top g 😅 👍 nice work
My great grandfather was a watch repair man. He worked on personal pocket watch of Russian tsar Peter the fist. As a gifthe received same model watch personally engraved by tsar himself for doing the work. It is now being passed through generations. I love watching watch repair videos I guess it’s in my blood.
I've never even worn a watch in my entire life but I absolutely love your videos and how in depth you go. Might bring out that old cheap digital casio I got gifted ages ago just to pretend I know a thing or two about watches lol
Fantastic job the owner will be delighted
I know nothing about watches but their intricacy always fascinates me.  Your precision and description to the layman is amazing.  As a neurologist, I could not help but notice the tremor and the compensation techniques you use to compensate on such detailed work.  Well done!
Even with all the wear and tear, with the cracked crystal, the semi-faded dial. This watch is STILL a masterpiece.
long time watcher(get it?), first time commenter. Marshall, you sob, you did it again. you restore a great watch, you take me on a goddamn journey, and goddammit it was a wonderful ride. as it is every time. every. time.
Amazing!
What a nice looking watch
There's more parts in that Rolex than my ar15
That's so lovely. Great work as it looked like a very tricky piece to work on.
What would the original price of the watch been?
I’m so impressed that anyone can completely take apart something like this, clean/repair and put it back together again.
I believe Rolex watches from that era had a movement made by Zenith! Also, your new web site gives a message from Norton warning me of a malicious web site. Any explanation?
This was completely captivating
hats off To Your Work
I just love watching these videos
Regrettable!!
talking, talking what a heaviness and what a dirty restoration!!!
You are a master that’s for sure,I work in many small details as a manufacturing jeweler.I worked with a great watchmaker for 20 years and he convinced me to stick with my craft as watches are something sometimes out of your control ( parts and time constraints) I miss him very much .I bought 2 Rolex watches from him one was a 1940s era Air King ( I wish I knew it’s history) do have a question was whale oil used in watches? I bet it was , I ve heard our government still uses it in very specific cases.Thanks for your work!!
I really appreciate the way you explain what each of the parts do as you’re disassembling and reassembling the watch. Thank you. Very educational.
Buen trabajo!!Nice job Amigo 👍👍
dont be fooled this is a 10,000 dollar watch. The reason Rolex is "worth" as much as it is, is because speculators and investors have inflated the price for whatever reason probably due to brand recognition and being rich asshats so they have to ruin yet more things similar to realestte. However now that the COVID investment spree has calmed you'll probably see them get cheaper. However if youre looking for a higher qualtiy watch there are so so so many brands to choose from that hasn't been ruined by speculators and investors
The cyclops is not aligned… but over all amazing video 👍
Those were the one that caused cancer on the workers back then and poisoned them
Have you had the opportunity to go through a Seiko Divemaster from the 70's?  I had one for 35 years.  Id like to see one overhauled.
I'm not an horologist but mechanical things interest me. The work you do mesmerizes me & catches my complete attention. Great work.
Marshall- hello, I have a 1978 Rolex 1500 and I want to transplant the movement into a 1680 head. Is this something that you can do. Please PM me.
Brave of you to tackle something so fragile – _very_  well done!
Amazing work. I enjoyed while I was watching. Although, I didn't repaired mechanical wristwatches ever, but digital only. Three pieces only, but enough to understand the basics, however, I know the electronic. Actually, I started with my, quite old Casio Marlin, from 80's, the father of G Schock, just because he lost its buzzing sound - the ferrite coil was damaged. I'd put the another one, and it was successful. Also I put the LED for lightning up the LCD. What was amazing me with this watch, comparing with other watches, was the fact that this is the only watch, where crystal glass is used to emit a sound, so it using it as piezo buzzer! This way, under the water while you diving, you hear the sound, 3 times better, then when the buzzer is placed under the back cover of the watch (anyway, the sound under the water is spreading 3 times further than on air), so this solution was truly wonderful. As the watch has countdown timer so you can set it to count how much oxigen you have in you bottle/s, it's crucial to rely on his buzzing noise, when the oxigen level remains low. What a beautiful idea and engineering behind this. With his glass used as piezo buzzer, you're not gonna miss this information.
How long did it take to become so familiar with the inner workings of a watch?
Stunning! Thanks for the video.
Can you tell me what these parts are, like a purple gem? Is it a sapphire?
In Philadelphia it's worth $50....
Seeing as most radium decays via alpha decay I wouldn't be surprised if the bulk of the radiation was being blocked by the crystal when you tested it.  Would love to see another test with the crystal off.
Why not just wear gloves at this point?
This man is really good in restoration with skill very rare. it need  long patience for the jobs. Bless this man for the jobs.
48:11 being very careful, it's very fragile also, 50:01
eBay Rebekah watch.  Won’t run,  do you think it’s worth taking apart?
Replaced parts inventory: Crown Crystal Bracelet Seals Other? If it were mine, I'd ask for a later non bakelit bezel if I planned to wear it, to prevent cracking, chipping, etc. Put it back on if sold or for rare special occasions and in safe storage otherwise with other replaced parts
I was holding my breath while you were working on that outside section...Phew.
I have a old Rolex I wouldn't mind if you looked at it for me
I know you always say you're just a hobbyist, and not a professional but you really are. You simply have a severe case imposter syndrome. Absolutely fantastic, entertaining, and extremely satisfying videos.
very unique work on a very unique watch.. a one-in-a million work..
hihi, where do you buy the watch spare parts ??
If they have teeth and mesh with others, they are gears.
amazing video, boss!
Great job!
I've got to say well done for not going to far with this watch,  you are a master in what you do.
Actual price <10K
That crystal probably shattered when the watch fell onto the floor, together with the shriveled, radioactive hand of the owner.
Absolutely fantastic and fascinating. I am in my late 50s and I have always been fascinated by automatic watches. The ability to design build a mechanical device that so accurately provides the time. The miniaturisation of parts.  Then to see one so knowledgeable disassembled serviced and reassembled is brilliant.  Thanks Matthew
After watching this, I know one thing for  sure, I know absolutely nothing at all. 🤪
Hello Marshall.  I have a Rolex Oyster Perpetual, Officially Certified Chronometer from the 1950's.  I believe my dad bought it in the 1950's while he was in the US Army.  He served in WWII in Europe and then also in Korea at the outbreak of the conflict there.  He died in 1958 when I was 9 months old, and this is one of the few items I have from him, so it is quite precious to me, probably the most precious thing I own.  I served for 31 years in the army myself.  The Rolex is running, but the self-winding function, which is what I believe the perpetual refers to, has never worked since I have had the watch.  The hands are also out of alignment.  I think it needs a decent servicing.  I have watched some of your videos and you seem very competent with a real passion for watches, particularly old ones.  Your concern for the people who own precious watches is very admirable.  Would you be interested in working on this watch?  Please let me know if you have a moment.  Many thanks, Sherman McGrew
did i just watch 52 min abt smth i dont have the slighetest clue over and didnt got bored? YES
Love the work, but out of curiosity; why was the case left alone? Would repolishing it hurt the value or something?
The "Watch Auctions" section on the new website is broken.
Что то не похож на 1958…
Very nice video and restoration. One comment: that is not how you set aside the balance wheel ...  You turn it over and place it on the bridge side to avoid damage to the balance spring.
I remember my dad working on watches for years. He loved watches and kept a lot of parts and did this until he could no longer see Good enough to practice his craft. When he passed away. He had boxes full of parts. He never met a watch that he didn't like. As long as it wound up or was Selfwinding He loved those sun  dial  watches too or thats what he called them thanks for the great video beautiful watch
the watch was 200 dollars back in 1958
Omg what a beautiful restoration... You've got nerves of steel Marshal!  The owner is very fortunate to have someone like you working on it
holy smoke. you make me so enchanted. so jealous of your work and patience when you work<3
6:53 OH MY GOD……………………. I am speechless………..
As a Software Engineer I love this. We deal with a similar level of technical detail, though we don't use a table to pull things apart and lay them out, we use our minds so nobody ever really sees how involved it can get. These videos are far more interesting than a programmer pulling something apart though. Great job!
My Dad worked on watches as a “moonlight” job for 60 years. Always had one bedroom in the house as a workshop. I would help in many small ways, like looking on the floor for small parts, but never had the fine touch or memory for reassembly so never took it up.  I did learn lots of curse words!
My 6 year old nephew told me about your show and I've enjoyed it very much 😊

You just got a new follower on IG.  Amazing work!
What a treat it is to watch you so carefully dismantle a precision instrument as we look on in amazement. Your commentary, observations and suspicions as each miniature fastener gets removed is a delight. You are amazing. Big fan.
Based on your Radiac .5 mrem/hr * 2000hrs = 1000 mrem= 1Rem.  The IS legal limit is 5Rem per year. Meaning you would have to have the watch on for 10,000 hours to receive the max legal dose.  However there are only 8760hr in a year so your good.
I find this calming to watch.
3.6 Roentgen, not great, not terrible.
Great work with your videos.  I wanted to let you know that virtually every non-quick set calendar mechanism does NOT require you to move 24 hours to advance the date.  Usually, all that is needed is to move the hands past midnight and back to around 8:30-10:00 (this varies by mechanism), past midnight again, repeating this cycle until the desired date is reached.  You will see the date number jump slightly when the mechanism has reached that earlier time.  This saves some unnecessary wear and tear on the cannon pinion.
Very wise to by a radioactivity meter. If I'm not mistaken Radium mostly gives of Alpha radiation so your meter must be suitable for that.Ingesting Radium is dangerous and wil mostly displace Calcium in your  bones , but far mor dangerous is inhalation of dust as local dose rate wil increase dramatically near the particle. You might want to keep your detector in a zip bag to avoid contamination of the detector. I suppose you can wipe dust with damp cloths and dispose of it properly.
Great job! Watched the entire video.
I believe the pattern on the crystal is crazing. Probably solvent exposure
So I’m an automotive/motorcycle engine builder. This tickled all the spots in my brain and I’m blown away at the complexity of this craft. I think I’ll be taking this hobby up as a way to better understand the engineering that makes the world work. Thank you for the amazing work!
I'm curious if the crystal had the odd pattern of degradation due to the radiation emitted from the radium? Just a thought???
2:29 The date on the counter is my birthday. 😂😂
Just curious I don’t know nothing about watches but what’s the reason for not using a sonic cleaner or something on the case or parts. Some it still looked like it had dirt on as he was putting it back together. Is it to risky to clean the parts that way? He mentions that it was to risky with the bezel
I'm a little shocked they were still using radium at late as 1958. hopefully they'd improved the working conditions of the people applying the ink by then.
There appear to be numerous tiny screws holding plates etc. How on earth do you know which ones go where?  I realise it takes years of studying and memory but are they a default size ie does the same screw fit multiple places by design?    Your work is to be admired, and beyond your skills the mind boggles at how those tiny watch parts are manufactured to tight tolerances, bushes, shafts all with running fits. Absolutely amazing 😮
It looked so nice out of the case and then you kept taking parts off and that’s when my stress level was growing to loose or not put it back together 😅
Sheesh, how on earth do you even remember where all these tiny pieces go? I can't even remember which button goes where when I clean my keyboard 😂
How do I go about nominating my Gruen for your channel.  It felt gumming when winding and now no longer runs
Watching you restoring watches, I kinda wanna do this too after I retire. Any recommendation on how to start learning?
Mesmerizing! Love to see you work!
Just awesome
As someone who knows watches I was wondering my mother had some watches that were hard to see through because the glass seemed to be polarized like those sun glasses people wear that look orange or blue and kind of change color depending on the angle made them hard to read the arms of the watch would you happen to know what types of watches are those growing up they were probably the prettiest watches I had ever seen but she keeps them stored away and never touches them.
Do modern battery powered watches need maintenance? If so, how often?
Good Ol' Radium! I would love to own a radium clock/watch!
This individual has skills. I can't repair and I can't see. Enjoying the video my father has a vintage Rolex his grandfather bought him when he was in his 20's. I shared this video with him I'm sure he will watch it 😁
I found this extremely interesting. Thank!
Marchel,how to contact you. I need help to repair a 70 year rolex
i had one like that but more rare u know why ? cuz michel jackson drop it in tunisia  event befor he died
Shout out to the radium girls who died horrific deaths painting watch parts. Its an interesting story that i recommend looking up.
That was amazing!
i wish US could be run by someone like u so accurate...wow fascinating skills, editing and explanation.
Del Boy has found another watch
Tenias que pulirlo.  Excelente trabajo.
Nice work mate! Now, the cost of the work will undoubtedly be many times the original cost of the watch! I’ll bet the old guy would turn in his grave! But note so pricey for the grandson. HE just got a magnificent old watch, from Gramps, for a fraction of what it is worth TODAY! Winner, winner…Rolex grinner! 😉❤️🦘🇦🇺
i never thought that i would get so interested and invested into something like servicing a watch. i do have an interest in watches and own one ""entry level" rolex myself, and find it incredible the amount of work and precision that goes into such machines. they truly are works of art, and you have an uncanny ability to make such a restoration informative, engaging and entertaining. first video i have seen of yours and i have definitely subscribed.
I found your videos are very relaxing to watch, relaxing job...
Everytime I watch (no pun intended) I feel I have to see the whole restoration to the end. These restorations are captivating!
i cant believe i watched an hour of someone repairing a watch... and then subbed.... fml
Can you just walk in at Rolex's and buy spare parts for a 1958 model? I mean the crystal. Or are every dimensions of the model the very same ever since so a crystal of a contemporary GMT is perfectly fit into grandpa's watch?
Anyone else watching this after 1:00 in the morning?
The crystal looks like heat damage  would cause them fractures
How can you remember all the parts placed? amazing !
Beauty !
Great work.  But a little too dangerous to wear unless all the lume is removed and replaced with modern lume.  I have something similar ...  the micro-Sievert counts add up very quickly to a year's worth of radiation limit (in just a few hours) and so it remains inside a lead prison until I can find a way to dispose of it.  The radiation is detectable through 2mm lead.
Should've contacted John Buckley
About the dial: I watched to the end where you discussed that it appears to be a refinished dial. That matches with the appearance, and also illuminates a huge caution with these watches. The original dials had radium-painted markers which would deteriorate into dust particles that would be very hazardous if you didn't take more precaution when removing the movement. They would have a chalky-appearance if original. This dial's numerals have a dull gloss, which indicates a refinish.
Job Well Done Marshall ! Mesmerizing to watch from start to glorious finish…what a beautiful vintage piece. Lovingly restored to former glory. Cheers from Nova Scotia..MikeR. (Ps. Knowing how brittle old Bakelite is, I thought it was the most dangerous part of the repair, but you held your nerve steady.)
The podcast Cautionary tales with Tim Hartford did an episode about the young women that worked in the factories that painted these dials. It’s a horrifying tale, but worth a listen.
Is there a reason for the finger condom as opposed to just wearing gloves?
Ahh, algorithm did great.
So amazing. Thank you for sharing . A watch ill probably never see in person.
absolute master at your craft.
fantastic
This is legitimately amazing
A 1958 GMT Master? Damn, that thing is a little gold mine. It's 10 years older than me.
Are you wearing a GMT Master to work on a GMT Master?
Radium girl 2.0
Identical story for me, when my grandfather passed he left behind a basically destroyed Navitimer, not terribly different than this watch's condition. After 3 months of waiting for Breitling they sent it back and it looks brand new and now I wear it almost daily. If I had the patience for watch repair I would totally do it!
Thx for this tutorial. I found 2 of those in my fathers house last year. With your tutorial i was able to restore them. They are in a really nice condition now and ill wear em as long as i live:). Many thanks again!
respect! :D nice to watch and listen to
Love the magic the gathering playmats
Я ЖИВУ В РОССИ ЭТО ПРОСТО БОЖЕСТВЕННО СПАСИБО ВАМ ЗА ВИДЕО ВЫ МАСТЕР С БОЛЬШОЙ БУКВЫ ХРАНИ ВАС БОГ.
Now that the old glass is missing, is it still the same watch? If yes or no, where do we draw that line?.
Each moviment costs 100usd. Each breathing 10usd.
Duuude! You should be wearing a face mask when dealing with that x-tal, dial, and hands. You breathe that highly carcinogenic stuff (radium) in and there's no way of getting it out of your lungs. 😝Ps. Run your geiger over the old x-tal. It'll be radio active as well.
Very cool thanks for the video.
Sir, how do I connect with you to get a couple of mine restored?
Not new luminous stuff on hands? Hmm kinda feels sad for that.
Good job,congratulations👏👏👏
that rubber oring in the crown was preventing the threads from engaging, needs to be compressed a bit before the threads meet
That was amazing Marshall!
☢️ Is the radon considered to be a health hazard nowadays, would it be safe as everyday wear?
Amazing restoration, but I am haunted by the tiny amount of the green tac stuck in the main spring and it's housing.
is it spring engine? i dont see baterry
WE HAVE THE SAME NAME!!!
Ita a fake
👎👎👎this is not a restoration!!!
The crystal damage is crazing, it could be caused by a number of things chemical exposure, UV exposure. Basically the plastic is just starting to break down. If this watch was worn as much as it looks like it was, it could have had 50 years of daily UV exposure.
A woman stuck a paint brush in her mouth and then in some radium paint and then painted that watch and then back in her mouth.
How much did pilots pay back in 1958 for this beauty ?
While we think we are rational beings, thinking of watches makes me understand how irrational we are. In no world should a timepiece be worth several times over what some people or even families make in a lifetime.
Peace sign hand.✌
So how does it keep time! JIM
Huh... I had a cheap auto pocket watch that stopped working, but its less than 10 years old and according to the manufacturer it was lubricated with graphite.
I have a video request: You should do a Gaga!..I'd love to see one taken apart because I have one of my own
Can we all appreciate how intricate a watch made in 1958 is? You would think they actually had precision machining back then.
I bet this watch was never serviced…
Nice work Marshall ,  awesome job
How are screws so small made ?
One of the most interesting 52 minutes I've spent for a while, thanks.
When you say "solvent" for cleaning the jewels what is it? Acetone? MEK? Also, do you have anywhere you can point us to what's in the watch cleaner solution?
Absolutely fascinating to watch!.  Iam  so impressed with your presentation .
I'm at 08:50... PLEASE DO NOT RELUME THE DIAL OR HANDS! That patina is priceless imho.  Thank you for agreeing with me :) I'm not a massive Rolex fan...but this watch is really triggering lustful feelings in me...mainly due to the Radium, Bakelite and history.
@10:01 It looks like there was witing on the back side of the face with a date. Possibly a noteation of replacement and when? unless it's just a hand written part number
Also a wow from me.
How can this be so enjoyable? I’m hooked, and I have to say “ thank you “ sir, for the work you do and for the way you explain the action.
Nice job....I love to watch a restauration like this !!!Hello from Croatia!!!
Love the channel. I knew I recognized that voice from MTG content over the years. :-)
I.have it's younger Brother, a 16760 Fat Lady GMT Master II  that I bought many years ago. Great Vid and awesome find Brother !
Is the face crooked about a degree or two counter clockwise?
i take that apart, it aint going back together without having few extra pieces that somehow didnt fit anywhere ...
"He lost his grandfather in a drawer." I chuckled. It must have been a huge drawer.
I had a 1968 Nipple Dial Steel/Gold GMT Master..... like a muppet I sold it for far less than it's worth 😞   The Original Pepsi Bezels are special though!
Please stop talking nex time
My fav you tuber by far.
I dont get it, why do i need a rolex with radiation for my arm??
Awesome vid i got to say. Awesome.
Every time one of these videos I forget that Marshall also hosts one of the best Magic The Gathering podcasts out there, Limited Resources 😅
I release "radon" gases too... but only after I eat Rays fathers barbecue! :|
How many years left until prices of watches like this one (20k-100k in price) are going to drop significantly. In the next 10-20 years there will be a lot of people passing away and I am sure that not all of their children/grand children are interested in keeping a watch like this one
I have a rolex sub from roughly late 50 to early 60:ths, that my father bought in the carabbean in the mid 60:ths from a marine, its all brown in the dail but works great. How can you tell the manufacturedate, and is it worth something?
You're a real artist at work WristwatchRevival !! What a stunning footage 👍👍
You are a legend
In a drawer?! …pft…ew.
✨🏆✨
Hezký opravil bych jen přední sklo a seřídil vnitřek, zachoval bych patynu ta je nejhezčí když jde na věcech vidět zub času.Ale jinak dobrá práce,po vašem (good job) ať se daří
I'm really interested. If you wouldn't mind telling me, how much do you charge for your time and skills? I doubt many people can do what you do...What would you charge for a watch restoration like this? My dad has an old Breitling and it's not working and is beaten up with a broken strap, cracked face and the hands have come loose...
If uncovering forgotten automobiles is called a barn find then wouldn't watches be considered a drawer find? 🌞
Real question,  if someone had one of these in it’s original packaging and never been worn. What would the value be?
Love this channel, the mechanics it involves such a plesure watching and relaxing.
2023 Oil will fix this Rolex for sure, thats what makes the inside "die", old Oil that drys up.
Damn, thats clean inside tho :)
My OCD ask you, please, use a container to safely place and store the parts! 😅
Hey Marshall! First off, I LOVE your videos and watch them when time permits. Even for meditation purposes :) What I was wondering for this video is that it seems like the GMT hand is touching the dial when you press it back into place... then again... I never saw the inside of a mechanical watch in real life, so chances are big its also my inexperienced eye :) Anyway, brilliant video! Loved watching it! Peter, the Netherlands.
Wow! That was an exciting journey ❤❤
When you said, "Made for PanAm Pilots" a bell rang! What classic watches were made for surgeons? How do I find the perfect watch for my grandson's graduation?
WHy did i eat a 52 min watch restoration video? No clue but i enjoyed every second of it.
I don't get the whole Rolex watch thing.  To me they're like diamonds which are intrinsically completely worthless and were only made out to be valuable through a scam by Debeers that has been run on the public for many decades.  It's not even a good looking watch to me.  I see watches that are less than $200 that are much more attractive.
Very complex integration, and it makes Rolex very expensive.
Wonderful watch
Not really fussed on Rolex regardless of its status . However i love the restoration process and are constantly gob smacked at the whole before and after result ✅
I think he said about 300 plus times “watch”
what a wonderful video. I hope doing this one sends more similar projects your way.
Can u restore my invicta automatic watch?.
WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.
Nice job.
how does the watch know how many days are in each month? or do you just have to painstakingly wind it once a month?
Why does it seem like the machining of everything else finally caught up with a watch movement from 70 years ago? The tolerances and engineering of these is incredibly impressive for the time.
I just dont understand wtf people are talking about, how good of a job he did. you're telling me at 46:55 and 47:49 you would call that CLEAN? Its absolutely filthy.
100k.....rrrriiiggghttttt? who the fk would pay that? wtf
My GMT Master, purchased in 1969, lies on the bottom of the Saba bank, maybe 1/2 mile off the ladder.  I doubt if it is still ticking, but if you find it, indeed if you find Saba Island, good for you! Nice work Marshall-as usual.
I absolutely think that the work needs more cleanliness...... it looks very dirty internally and externally.... It has not been a great job.....
True definition of having the right tool for the right job. Love it.
A man who truly knows and loves in what hes doing... nice video.. couldnt stop watching this... wish i could afford that watch.
Great job on this GMT. I received two Rolex  knock offs from a trip I made to China years ago. It seems to work fine, but what is an easy way to tell that they were an actual knock off?
Not sure why I'm suddenly watching this, but with nearly 3 million views I'm a little sus... regardless of why, I must say that one of the magically beautiful things about the YouTube experience is stumbling upon a subject I know less than zero about, but it ends up being the most interesting thing in the world  at this moment. This guy does a great job as well. Great voice, awesome presentation by an obvious master of his craft sharing his vast knowledge in a way that totally avoids (considering howqalp valuable the item is) being snooty and stuffy.
Such great talent
Thank you for sharing❣️
Does it need a new o'ring?
First timer (no pun intended!). That was so entertaining! I usually shun videos longer than about 20 minutes, so when I saw yours was over 50, I thought I skim through, but no; that was fascinating and so well explained all the way through. I was thinking at one point "So what's the difference between the two, coloured lubricants, and almost immediately you started to explain them! Brilliant stuff!
I do like the radiation part, well done. Its really ONLY a danger if it gets ingested. it is very harmfull inside the body but worn on your wrist, 150mSv/d on your wrist is negligable. It is, as your said, a thing to be aware of during servicing. I hope (as I have not watched past 3 minutes yet) that you can keep the original material, as nothing I know gets close to the ionizing glow of radon paint.
When its a 1958 watch and has lume I immediately think "that must be a radium"
One of my favorite manufacturers is Elgin late 1800s to about the early to mid 1930s
Excellent work as always. You are a true master craftsman. Thank You for sharing sir.
This looks so cool, and I wish I would be able to do something like this! But I have a severs tremor in both hands that don't lend itself well to this kinda precise work sadly, but its fun to watch either way!
Bravo.  Very impressive work my friend.
Amazing job bro. Truly an art form.
Thanks
I'm getting anxious. I mean, HOW WILL HE REMEMBER WHERE EVERYTHING GOES??
there is proverb in russia  "three things you can watch forever - flowing water, crackling fire and someone working" your videos are great
Thank you for another great restoration adventure! Question: If the watch face was refreshed by a factory service provider, would there be a record of the repair? Also, I'd think the bakelite ring would've been updated at that time, providing it was done a few years after purchase.
Your presentations and skills are always so wonderful to behold. Bravo!!!!! Question. I have an Omega watch that belonged to my dad. I'd love for my son to have it. It's not currently working. It says "Omega Automatic" on the face of the watch. Would you be interested in fixing this watch for one of your videos? It would be so special to have a video of you actually fixing it and applying your skills on it.  No worries either way. 🙂
Wow you make this look so easy. I really love the work you do but I could never do it. My hands are way to shaky
Not into watches but I am into timepieces. So this was still cool to watch. ⌚
You did such an amazing job! Watching this was one of the most relaxing and enjoyable activities I've experienced in ages.
Thank you so much for your videos, you're my Bob Ross!
The Date is not 11 1958 but II 1958 (second quarter )
Dude sounds like Mike Tirico the nfl announcer lol
How much was the restoration if I may ask
Just a heads up, youtube is blowing up your channel. This video has been recommended to 4 separate people I know and myself as just a random recommended video. Do with this informative whatever you want but I felt I should let you know after it's been brought up in conversation 4 times now
You can hear your nerves! A fabulous transformation. That bezel and the radioactivity would make you so careful if you wore it these days. It would be hilarious if it set off radiation detectors at the airport!
This is amazing from beginning to end. ¡¡¡Congrats!!! 👍🏻
My Dad and I use to build and fix whatever was needed for the house, like  bookshelves, little tables, fix our own cars(70s and 80s cars when you didn't need to mess with a computer) ect  When I was trying to get something perfect he'd always say "we're not building watches". So when I watch these repairs it makes me think of him.  Wonderful work!
beautiful watch. definitely not great for everyday wear though, considering the radium paint (which is also stunning, i should say). fantastic work
I love watching it with a 2x playspeed and amazingly you still have a clear voice.
The radioactive dial would scare me to death. ☢️
A lot of people forget that Rolex was originally made to be worn lol
I was thinking, LUM+1958=Radioactive? And, well, just a little. 🤣 what a great find and restoration. A beautiful watch born the same year as me.
Outstanding work!! I love watching this  channel.
Quality m8.
I would have left the crystal and the bracelet as much as possible as they were, what a conversation piece. New parts just don't belong here
I had no idea how intricate the workings of a watch are. Its insane that this was ever invented. Great work. Good job!
Your skill, and craftsmanship, combined with all the great information, make your videos mesmerizing. excellent!!
My iPhone battery is dying after 4 years of use and since Apple charges battery replacement for the same price as the new iPhone, I will have to replace it soon. This watch has the age of a human and is still (t-)kicking. Good times! Work, earn, subscribe to these brands, yet unable to buy a house.
My hunch, based on the condition of that crystal is that it was in a house fire at some point in it's life. It would explain why everything was so tight and bound up
How is the ruby real and synthetic at the same time ?
Wauw
Hey Wristwatch guy, what is your deck that you are using in MTG??
Do you play magic the gathering?
Very interesting 😊
Could you please film a video showing you working from slightly further away. I would like to see how much you do with an eye loupe/ microscope? Thanks
I dont know much about watches, but that was a really interesting video! How were these parts manufactured back then? Was that already early cnc stuff?
Great work!!!  Cool lamp at 20:45 btw
What a treat to watch this and then see you use a product that I manufacture, the aerocon o-ring lubricator box you used to grease the winding stem, 36 minutes into the video!
Just happened to come across this video and now I’m hooked! Very impressive to say the least. What blows my mind is along with your mastering skills but the machining that made all those tiny parts.
Absolutely mind-boggling just from looking at all the tiny tiny parts scattered about the table! What talent and memory!
Blablabla
👍🤩💝WOW!  Fantastic. Absolutely beautiful watch. I absolutely enjoyed watching this restoration. Thank you.🙏💝
I love watching surgery on humans but on watches, it is even more challenging and therefore, great watching (pun intended)! You might not wish to respond to my question but I'm certain many others besides myself would love to know the answer. It's this: how much would you charge for your service to such valuable watches like this Rolex?
As soon as i heard the year and saw it glow i knew it would be radioactive
Do you work on swiss army watches, i own an ambassador calender automatic watch with black dial, it quit working a few years ago and just didnt send it in to get it worked on. let me know if you do, where to send it and cost would like to know thanks Joel.
Your videos are very Zen Sir.  Peaceful, confident and satisfying.
Felicitaciones
crazy work as always. your microscope work is on point. what microscope is that and how is your lighting setup for microscope that it dsnt have many reflections. new hobbyist here and always admiring your work :)
How many hours work was that restoration.
Doctor, amazing job sir.
Very informative. Thanks
I have an old Rolex. It was gifted to me. It was serviced back in the 90's. The crystal is off by a few degrees. It looks ugly to me..
I want a new one. Maybe that's me
When cleaning the parts, you say it’s not so bad because they’re submerged in liquid, but what about the drying cycle? Does it not oscillate during that part?
Probably taken from some dead mafia guy back in the day. 😂
The movement is gorgeous.
Brilliant ❤. Really enjoyed watching a master at work...... Brilliant thanks 😊
Hey, this guy sounds just like Marshall Sutcliffe from the Magic community!
Did granddad glow in the dark?
How do you keep track of which of those tiny screws goes where? I would be so incredibly confused. It is one of the only reasons that I am hesitant about starting this hobby, I’m concerned that once I got it taken apart I wouldn’t be able to get it back together! Beautiful work on such a beautiful watch!
Mesmerising👍
Two Words : F**cking Brilliant 👌👌
No experience at all in watches, but the damage on the crystal looks like stress cracking. Have seen this on various clear plastics that were exposed to solvents. I doesn't take much, fumes or some droplets of the wrong stuff are sometimes enough. What are they made of?
My birthday is the same date as this watch's manufacturing date. I'm afraid it is out of my price range though.  😢
How much money for this good restoration?
I was completely fascinated with this rebuild and outcome..you are exceptionally skilled..👍🏻🙂
Would not having the original bracelet affect its value?
Casually handling a 200K watch
Oh, if i sent a Rolex like that in to the company and it came back with a different Bezel, id be MAD AS HELL.. lol.
A professional uses torque screwdrivers to ensure that screws are tightened to the appropriate level.
great work!
Great work! I have a friend down here in Brazil who has a 1958 Rolex GMT. The bakelite bezel insert was so bad that he replaced it with a decent plastic replica.
Love it. Very inspiring.
I don't know about anyone else but I classify your type of content as educational, in much the same way as I enjoy watching The History Channel or How It's Made. Always fascinating to watch (no pun intended), but more importantly, it's the stories that accompany them that bring it down to earth and make it relatable.
You and Neil Degrasse Tyson are absolute voice dopplegangers! Nice restoration
That’s a one hour ocd satisfaction ride!
Takes me back to the radium girls
Impresive work but why is the case still dirty
😕 im sweating doing a head gasket on our corolla and then i see this. why is life so complicated lol
So I'm curious since I used to work with radium, it's that watch safe to wear? I know that radium is an alpha emitter and that your skin and even paper can block alpha particles. That being said so you have to worry about anything? Granted, what I worked with as a few mCi that was shelled with lead and that's probably super low.
So amazing!
Where do you source a good quality crystal that fits the watch? I have a Tudor watch with a broken crystal and I'm not sure where to find a new one or how to tell if it's good quality.
loved it mate... amazing resto... how much did you charge for this resto btw... ?? just curious... cheers
What will happen if you sneeze? 🤧
Such an interesting video to watch. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and talents with us. Your appreciation for the watch is so enjoyable to see.
Um trust me when i say you would be better off with someone else servicing your watch then me. These hands dont fix things even though i wish they did
That Watch sure looked like a working mans Rolex.
This resto vid made me sweat buckets. My eyes went tunnel vision due to prolonged focus. Good stuff, twas a good day
such a breath of fresh air dude. talented individual but also not slamming me with an advertisement for therapy or hello fresh. instead you have your own website, classy name, making your hobby more accessible. many thanks
Wow !
An other Marshall here,I see you have the surname spelling of Marshall also.  I fix things to. Just a lot bigger, mostly vintage tractors and machinery. It must be difficult to make parts so small with such tight tolerance. The best I can get from my 1959 late is 0.0005" but that take quite a bit of doing. Very interesting video. M  😀
I don't have the faintest interest in watches but still have a few nice ones, but your channel is just mesmerizing magnetic for my OCD order and tidiness  needs when working. Right tools, right attitude and simple and detailed talk. it's just ASMR when i work
Thank you from New Zealand this was an excellent video.
I mean this with great respect, your videos are great sleep aid. Watching you carefully take watches apart and talk about what exactly you're doing really soothes the brain. Much love. ❤
Such great narration.  Oh, and the watch is nice too... /wink
I think that my father have one of that
Old is gold👍
robot brain surgeon
Why don’t you take the crown tube gasket out before you put the case in the ultrasonic cleaner?
Beautiful work, im not a watch repair guy and i thoroughly enjoyed this video though how they operate is just amazing to me almost like a mechanical living thing, very cool.
Were would you get high end small tools for learning watch repair and is 55 to old the reason is when you siamo that you get the same satisfaction as working wood i had lots of wood working tools but now we live single room the way put it hit home
Who films and edits these videos???
How are SUCH small parts created????
Sutcliff as in maybe related to Stewart Sutcliff? An Oriiginal Guitarist of the Beetles???
@Wristwatch Revival your video editing is spot on, very enjoyable and satisfying  to watch your restorations
Sick of fake restoration videos. Can't even find real ones anymore they are buried under a million fake bs restoration videos. Youtube is trash since they got rid of the ability for the community to dislike a bad video now youtube just decides what is popular not the users. And yet here we are still using it.
Yep, this watch is your travel companion if you're wanting to get mugged.
Had to pause at 9:15 because I just KNEW that I heard your voice before and I have!  I watch the hell out of MTG stuff and you've commentated on so many events.  I thought I recognized your voice but figured MTG and watch restoration was probably too big of a leap to make.  Glad I'm not going crazy!
I bought that EXACT watch on Temu for $12   :)
Do repair pocket antique pocket watches too or just wrist watches?
love the video keep up the good work never seen so many parts in a watch before
I prefer casio f91w... They are cheap, multifunctional, punctual and not radioactive.. Also nobody try to kill u for your f91w..   This shiny things for ladies, not for mans...
Great craftmanship... now imagine spending 100K on a watch.
You can transport the audience so well with the voice over recording.  It sounds as though it's happening in real time. These are great videos on many many levels, love them.
I have a Rolex submariner my dad owned have used it for a few years and just slowed down and stopped I’m 65 and this watch I would like to be restored and pass it on to my son just thinking of how much it would cost for repair and restoration I took it to a Rolex shop in Toronto and they said they don’t do vintage like what I have
You are very skilled and talented in your craft, I was in the electronics service business for 40 yrs, looking at your work, tools and ease of handling the repairs, I can say you're truly a crafted and gifted technician.  You got a lucrative youtube channel as well.....something I didn't have available to me back in the day.
Does the time zone arm work on friction off the hour hand?  When you set the time, the red time zone arm changed drastically from +3 hrs to +0 in a few spins.   Did it get over lubricated?
Hi Marshall. This watch is a babe. I am unsurprised that apart from the spring, no new parts or staking was needed. However, having seen the underside of the rotor and the yellow on the main plate makes me ask what condition the rotor bearing was in? The same question for your average cal.11 and 12 microrotor movement. A top video as always. Many thanks go over to you from Germany. Mike
What would a restoration of this caliber cost?
6:54 The moment my life was changed forever.  (slight exaggeration) 8:37 The moment your life was changed forever.  (slight exaggeration...but you were hit with .01% of the radiation you would get during a dental X-ray exam)
Man you have no idea how much you help me unwind. Thank you so much! ❤
Beautiful watch. I wish i could buy it
I was a surgical assistant and was amazed by your dexterity.
I came across your video while watching a Magic The Gathering Commander session. Intrigued by my curiosity and also being a fan of repair videos, I decided to click. As soon as you started speaking, I said,  'Wait a minute... I recognize this voice!' I realized you're the one who brilliantly presents live games for Magic The Gathering competitions. That moment sealed the deal, and you earned a new subscriber!" thank you
Are you a Rolex technician ?? Meaning working for Rolex watch co?
Muy buen trabajo,, 😊👍
Just when I thought I knew how to do a lot of things, YouTube has to go and recommend something like this 😂 So cool!
Nao foi restaurado os ponteiros e nem o mostrador serviço pela metade , nota 5
Great work !!!!
That is very entertaining.
Man, my brow was sweaty just from watching you work.... My Rolex, year 1985 from serial number, needs some attention but will probably wait until I get past this kidney cancer. Recovering from the surgery but, well, still gotta see if my clock keeps ticking. I knew the service would be tedious but perhaps not so much.  I'm no craftsman but intensely admire the fine workings of exotic cars and machines such as these watches. Most amazing is the idea that someone set out to make even the simplest watches and clocks much less a precision timepiece. Hand making every gear and tiny screw.  May your hands always remain steady.... rick in Tennessee.

Amazing.
Did he die from wrist cancer?
I would have not did glass but done all other stuff
I am always very fascinated by this precision mechanic works. Thank you for your quality channel.
Please do: The thing was hard to remove because of this: (explanation). NOT OMG I'm worried how this will turn out when I remove this thing! You have already removed it. You are doing a voice over. After the fact. I like your content but know you have a smart audience. Maybe focus on your craft not the dramatization of your craft. All the best
I like this guy's work but the post fix dramatization in the audio track has me hating this guy's content. Just be honest about the repair. Don't create drama that does not need to be there. The repair is amazing enough. Sure, give a background. But if you've taken the fly wheel out previously, I don't need to hear a manufactured shock response in the audio after the fact. Be well and all the best.
И в чем рестоврация то? Как были грязными и расцарапанными, так такими и остались...
What amazes me is that how do they even cnc those tiny parts back in the 50s?
Radium is only dangerous inside your body.  If you pulverize it or somehow get it into the air and breathe it, then it can be dangerous. It is not dangerous on your wrist.
I don't have a watch and I'm not into watches at all, but this video popped up in my feed, watched every second of it, and maaaan, that was an amazing journey! That is one fabulous watch!! And it is an equally fabulous video with wonderful narration and amazing shots! Excellent job on the watch AND the video, Sir!  EDIT: I may not have nor afford these types of watches but I certainly can afford to be a new fan subscriber of this channel! Looking forward to watching the other videos!
still looks like siht
That magic the gathering mouse pad is 🔥 tho
Man, it would be just heavenly if Rolex made practice movements. Their movements are always so beautiful and easy to put back together, they just tend to be way too complicated and expensive to ever risk starting out on
Wow! What an awesome watch with awesome patina. That bakelite is very fragile, they used it in alot of items and they become very brittle and break easily like you said. I would be super stressed as well working on that watch. Thanks for sharing the video.
I would replace the bezel with a modern day one for radioactive safety, and to preserve the bakolite one. Send it back with the watch. Put the old bezel in a safe!
others have possibly made this assumption but i believe that the cracking on the crystal is due to years and years of the temperature and humidity changing causing it to expand and contract more and more drastically, causing those wavy or curved patters. That or its from a very sudden change of temperature, hot or cold. Thanks mr fran for teaching me about glass cracking patterns in my high school forensics class
Am curious. When you were tightening the myriad of screws, are the torqued at all, or do you use experience to know how far to tighten them?
I know nothing about watch restoration or repair. But I just watched almost an hour clip and enjoyed every bit of it.
This makes me wanna get into watch making as a hobby. Seeing how careful you have to be taking apart a watch of this caliber etc looks so fun
I had a GMT II Batman for several years and stupidly I sold it  a few years back. I can just kick myself now.
It’s amazing how valuable this old boat anchor is…people are so dumb…
Wow! Amazing video! 👏🏼
24 hour hand! Interesting!
cool!
Great video. Would prefer it if you didnt pretend it was live commentary and just phrased it as past tense actions
This video is way more interesting & fun to watch if you hit the "Mute" button first.
My wife's father passed last December (2022) and we've been going through his things over the past year. We came across a Rolex submariner. Wasn't ticking but I moved it around a little bit and it started ticking again. Doesn't look as bad on the surface as this one but kinda scratched though and missing the knob on the side. Was wondering if I might be able to get any info on where to sell a watch like ours. We aren't watch people so any help would be appreciated.
I had no idea how intricate these watches are. My Lord
I could not stop watching..lol...great vid.
He’s like the Bob Ross of watch restoration.
Master craftsman.
Maybe his grandaddy stole from somebady and put in the ground and after couple years later took it 😅
I love to watch precision work on anything mechanical.  I really have no interest myself in trying it.  I'm all thumbs and I have proven that to myself a number of times.  But, I find this kind of work very satisfying and relaxing.
💩💩💩💩💩💩 is more worth then that whahahaha
The passion, this guy loves what he does. Bravo on the quality work.  Love from Senegal 🇸🇳
I‘d love to know how much you charged for this one!
Ooof that scratch though at 18:31   That's painful to watch.
2.6m view in 2 weeks? I thought I was the only one watching these kind of videos like this one. Nice to know!
Surprisingly, this channel is also good for learning English. Not only his voice is smooth but also his word choice is fantastic.
very nice!
Amazing work 🙏🏻
This was a great pleasure to "watch" your work. Love the way you explain and show your work. Thanks !
I’m 61 years old and though I’m not very handy with home repairs….i love working on and building firearms.   I recently had an urge to learn about watches, as Ive been collecting them for years.  I changed about twenty batteries and now…..im addicted to the satisfying feeling of working on these awesome little machines.  I’m so happy that I found your awesome channel and I’m very excited to see what you offer on your website.   Thank you and stay safe.  Mike
nice
No excuse for not keeping your watch clean!
It came to my mind, that when the movement actually came alive, it's like the previous owner's soul leaving the watch. It's his energy that wound it up. Quite touching...
love your vids, best watch restoration guy on here but calling you out a little bit lol, 740k subs and you're literally recording a profession thats making you 100k++++ a year, you DEFINITELY 100% have the money to buy that watch lol i see dudes with 250,000 subs driving around in lambo's
Wth who thought to put all those parts in that watch my goodness amazing 😮
I was scared about the radio active reading on this watch. For your safety next time use full gloves on both hands before starting to work on them. And again i love what you are teaching the beginners in watch servicing free of charge. Thanks again.😇
I wonder why they put jewels inside, where they can't be seen.
Absolutely fascinating and so well documented 👏
out of curiosity how much was it to buy the crystal  and the crown
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
A master at work 👍
The crystal looks like it cracked from heat.
so what is this watch worth now as it sits after your clean up?
does polishing the case lose value?
My name is Marshall as well.
I find it funny how close watches and guitars have in common, bakelite was used for the plastics on 50's and 60's fenders and gibsons but as you said is very fragile. Another thing you said was "This watch was WORN and I respect it" when you see a guitar with buckle rash and neck wear you know that guitar must be special, same with watches, the patina makes it what it is.
Your practical skill and professional excitement are just a perfect match. It is obvious that you love your craft and your videos are very interesting. The way you explain every step and narrate what you are doing make it super relaxing to tag along. That is an absolutely awesome watch, I am happy for you that you made it work again! I bet the owner was happy too. :)
Quick question, is there a document or a website where one can find the specs of such pieces like how to clean them, put them back together, specs for repair parts etc? I am very curious!
What a massive shame that YouTube has totally destroyed the viewing experience by forcing an ad every five minutes. I use to be transported by an hour of the best entertainment going, but now it's just horrendous - thanks YouTube!! You rich guys with a premium subscription are lucky...
i know nothing about watches but that did not feel like 52 minutes
Me quedé encantado viendo todo el vídeo, qué maravilla!
Just fantastic. Sure it's not the first precission work you have done. One sneeze and all blows up!. Amazing very well filmed and explained video. I was about opening a 40 years old Baume&Mercier Capeland which suddenly stoped moving but got in panic as I saw what you have done. Best wishes.
That transformation is amazing. But even more amazing is how complex and fine detail that watch is. It’s hard to believe that such devices were made back in the 1950’s before computers. Just imagine how skilled all of the artisans were and how precise their measurements and tools to make such tiny components.
This type of video should serve as educational material, not only for technical schools but also for individual and cultural growth.
Crazy to think that this was a point to someone's everyday dress wear and then one day it was put into a drawer and never worn again.
Hi, great video, the crystal is damaged chemically but not by physical abuse. Maybe some perfume in the drawer, alcohol, nail polish remover.
I believe that is a stolen watch… it was stolen from an arm from a young 16 year old pilot who was gifted by a machinist friend from Connecticut. The watch was pulled off the arm by thieves of valuable collectors items. I recognize the cracks .. the radium Bakelite dial and the colors which were all made as an issue as part of the discussion when it was given to the young lad as as a gift who was also friend of Charles Lindbergh at the time.
My gosh, what a barn find! I'm glad you were able to restore it to it's former glory and returned it to the owner so they could enjoy it! I'll never be able to afford a watch that amazing but I'm happy I own an older omega my wife bought me for our wedding present. 🎉  I'll look into that watch kit yall made :)
Best example ever of "one man's trash is another's treasure". If I came across that cruddy watch, I wouldn't spend $1 on it never mind $100k! To each his own, I guess!
Can't believe you worked on that soexific rolex, its my favourite watch of all time. After that service i can tell the watch is super happy, you obviously are happy and the owners even more. I know, because i'm happy after watching this video.  What an amazing watch and what an amazing job you did there.
Unbelievable how you know how to put it back together 😂🙏😂☮️ Great job
I have a 14 karat gold Jules Jurgensen chronograph wristwatch that was my dad’s that I inherited when he passed away it has a crown and says established in 1740, on the back of it it says 14 K0585 then it has a symbol. I’m not sure kind a looks like an anvil with 158 in it and then it has another symbol. It looks like it could be a squirrel but not really sure.
You did a great job! Watching you work was my pleasure! Thank you for allowing us into your world of restoration!!
That turned out to be absolutely gorgeous!! 🤩😍🥰😊
Ayyyyyyyy
Most folk wouldn’t have a clue just how rare and valuable that watch is if they found it in an old relative’s home! I wonder how many gems like this have been thrown in a skip by relatives clearing out a deceased relative’s house?
I remember the smell from Bakelite as we had a Bakelite phone in our house in the early 70’s! Once smelled, never forgotten!
Bro, lol change the wiener gloves.
Respect , Sir
You've come a long way Marshall.  There was a time you would be too intimidated by the cost to work on this watch.
Bro  just casually dropping the bits on the table... how the hell you remember where everything goes?!
I wonder if there is any kind of torque spec in those screws?
Wow, the trick to put out the count needle was amazing. I learned from the master. Thanks a lot!
That is why there wasn't any rust because GOLD inside,
Great Job. In 2003, an employee of the house in Vienna needed money and offered the GMT to me. I was clueless back then. He only wanted 3,500 Austrian schillings (255 euros). I bought this watch. The next day I sold the watch to a second-hand watch shop for 18,000 Austrian schillings (1,308 euros) and was extremely happy. Unfortunately, after a few years I realized what a big mistake I had made. The man who sold me the watch has become Freelancer in Vienna. I meet him from Time to time and then and we greet each other. But neither I nor he dare to talk about it. Today I own  a few good watches  and I appreciate them. The GMT from back then was exactly the same condition as this watch. That was also the reason why I wanted to get rid of him quickly. Best regards.
I’m sure it’s a plastic not Crystal   anything before the 80s was plastic on them and the shattering looks like a sun damaged plastic  please let me no if I’m wrong thank you.  Put your lips to it and if it’s warm to the touch  and crystal is cold tells you this is what I was told to do to find the age.
...riveting stuff. Could watch it all day. Pun intended.
So much cooler than batteries for power!
Never seen your channel before, but what a way to start...wow!
Didn't see you check if the bezel turned as it should. I assumed everything was good. Beautiful restoration. Thanks for sharing.
I can't put a key in a keyhole without struggle. Amazing how steady your hands are. I'd gouge my eyes out trying anything this precise. Hats off to you!
🫡 good job
Totally badass....stella work.
No olihan siinä toimintaa yllinkyllin yhdelle  päivälle! Kysymys kuuluu, että missä kohtaa 5000€ merimaisemista kerkeää nauttimaan? Retorinen sellainen! Hyvät Joulut sinne ja Uutta vuotta!
i'd like to start.....but for me it will be impossible to remember all the parts and where they go!
Thing i find is fasinating every second in time. i have my grand parents clock that ticked through both world wars. Does boggle the mind specially at armistice hour. them eleven mean something a clock hat age
my EDC watch is a G shock Casio illuminator
I enjoyed watching this episode and your narration is awesome.
i have a orginal master like this one but with a black bezel and the original jubilee belt. passed to me when my father died of cancer (not caused by the watch but the chemicals he worked with all his life) and its not working right so i am not wearing it. its hard to find a shop that can do it right. unsure of the value but a rolex 16753 is pretty rare these days so i am not going to the local watch store with it. having such watches and just want to wear it as a everyday watch is difficult these days when "real" watchmakers are so difficult to find now.
Nice 🙂👍
I’d have guessed the crown gasket you replaced was culprit of that problem. Would have liked to see  how much wear was in original bracelet. Very nice job great camera work.
Sings the bezel about the tiny parts naked on your bench:  "Oh please don't Sneeze these, you know it hurts so much!"... Ya know they need your tender touch.   (Pop song, Cliff Richard 1960).
Absolutely amazing😊
Magnificent job Sir.  🖤
I am curious about what you charge to fix a watch like this, given all of the parts to be replaced and cleaned.
Thanks for the drinks & smoke, feels like my clock was cleaned😂
Great video, can you tell me what it cost to restore that great looking GMT?
Definitely one of the best watch restoration videos ever. Not only because this is my favorite Rolex watch model or just my favorite. The 6542 is just extra special and with the original bakelite insert to boot. Also i totally admire your skill and video capabilities. Just amazing and hard to top. This was also the first time I saw this movement disassembled and I worked on many watches when I was younger including newer Rolex models. Thank you Sir.
At 51:31 - why is the dial not aligned with the body?  Also, is  there enough clearance between GMT hand and the dial? Not a criticism to your work, but is it typical for old Rolexes?
Amazing Sir! I like your jobs sir! I'm from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia ❤
@15min mark I'd be drinking smoking and smashing this beautiful Rolex.  Great job, truly a meditative show. ✌️  ps Rolex in a draw = JACKPOT $70K+++
How do know where those parts go????
I knew watches were complicated but I didn't know they were that complicated, especially with the articulation of all of the wheels. Thia was a really cool and informative video. I think I have gained a new respect for watchmakers and the insane level of balance and patience it takes to practice that profession.
I remember my first Rolex... an Air King made in the 50's.  I bought it used in 1970 for the whopping sum of $75 - new ones were sold at the time for about $150.  In those pre-quartz days, it was worth spending extra for a quality timepiece that kept time and would last.  But I'd never pay Rolex prices today; you'd have to have more money than sense.  I can't imagine a manufactured commodity with such a fantastic profit margin for the maker.
Whenever I see you unwinding the main spring right over the tiny, tiny screws, I actually EXPECT that some day the spring hits right into the parts, distributing them over the table. https://youtu.be/zQhHQ7pkBf8?t=1085
Bem eu sou emigrante na China e estou casado com uma mulher do Brasil e vejo com tristeza que há razão para preocupação mas ao contrário do que dizem no vídeo o que move este sentido xenófobo é o medo. Este medo que se manifesta em racismo não é exclusivo contra brasileiros mas contra a distribuição de recursos e oportunidades entre cidadão e residentes estrangeiros. Os Brasileiros que emigram hoje são trabalhadores qualificados e em regra profissionais com um resistência no trabalho notável em especial em lidar com clientes difíceis num sector tão importante como o turismo mantendo a postura e um sorriso contagiante. Por fim, acho que o anacronismo da crítica histórica não faz qq sentido. Desculpem Portugal tem 10 milhões de habitantes São Paulo tem 15 milhões… Portugal não é arrogante porque só o tamanho dele em relação ao Brasil faz dele uma país ridículo. Essa narrativa é de um nicho mais envelhecido da população e reacionário que não percebe que Portugal é uma misturada de gente de todo o mundo! Portanto  ignorante da sua própria história. O emigrante brasileiro nada tem a ver com o emigrante que dos anos 80. Na verdade os médicos dentistas brasileiros vieram revolucionar um sector da medicina nos anos 90 que estava estagnado. E isso também causou muita polémica (medo mais uma vez). Mas infelizmente tb houve muita emigração ilegal. O contexto do que aconteceu historicamente faz parte desse passado e acho que o mundo é global e a cidadania será um dia mundial também. A perspectiva colonialista não é generalizada e o que aconteceu foi um episódio triste. E não acho que represente a maioria dos Portugueses. Todo o contexto de emigração tem de ser analisado tendo em vista outros movimentos migratórios recentes para fora de Portugal pois há bem pouco tempo voce teve portugueses fugindo pra o Brasil (1974) . Por outro lado, na mesma altura, chegavam Portugueses que viviam fora de Portugal em vários países africanos. Chegaram entre 1974-1980 cerca de m1 milhão de portugueses ou seja em pouco tempo a população aumentou 10% e com isso veio o medo. Portugal é muito pequeno e está a aprender a abraçar a emigração. Também comete erros mas somos certamente mais condescendentes e acolhedores em especial 😊do povo brasileiro.
Good job, thanks for sharing. You could have done a better job of cleaning, there are visible residues left on the interior parts.
Fabulous watch and what an incredible restoration. Thanks for sharing!
She is a beauty!!! Great job and super to watch your videos!
Wonderful work!! When disassembling do you lay the parts out in order or do you have your own system? I was watching and it did not seem like you were doing it in order or by assembly
What makes a watch like this so expensive? i mean, it have parts for like $50 max?
Congrats! That's a dream piece for many a watch tinkerer.
Wow. Not realy a Rolex fun but.... with this restoration and the 'after' look .... wow! . congrats on fantastic work
show!👏
Man gotta say though that repairing that watch must have been a.. *time* consuming project 😂
Amazing work, there's no way I could remember where all those parts would go and or the order of which the parts go back in. lol I'd have to make a recording of the disassembly and still mess it up. great job.
Do you use a schematic of any type when putting one of these watches back together?  So many tiny parts how do you keep track of what goes where?
Is that a RM1030 movement? You didn't mention the calibre of the movement but I saw the 1030 on it and thought it might be.
Wow👌
Wow! Just came across your Channel and am so pleased I did.   Wonderful work- I've learned tons after only watching 2 of your Videos, this one and your Aunt's dress watch one. Many thanks.🙂♥️
THEY ARE UGLY BASIC LIKE WATCHES.....nothing special about them.....the job itselfs was fascinating but as far as the WATCH's value concerns? to me they are garbage....Japanese or Chinese watches are truly a masterpiece watches....they are jewelry...vs. just a timepiece.
Such a beautiful watch.  Masculine,  fine engineering.
I get the high quality of the materials and the name that comes with a price, but imo Rolex just builds boring as fuck watches not worth the price 😂
Where do you get the assambly instroctions?
Thanks for filming and uploading. Always a treat to watch fine work being done. 👌😊👍
Wow, when the movement started up immediately when you dropped it from the case was so cool, really shows the impeccable craftsmanship of the people working on these watches. Much respect to you for taking care of these historic pieces!
I'm an automotive technician I've been a tech for over 20 years and got to say taking that watch looks intimidating as hell I don't think  I can ever take one apart let alone put it back together. You sir are a master my respect 💪🏼🔥
beautiful watch, love the well worn look on the patina. But 100k to wear radiation on my arm, no thanks
Fabulous!😊
how in world you can still remember how to get all those pieces back to original place?
Honest question: is it easier to put on 6 individual finger cotts instead of one pair of latex gloves, or is there another reason?
Careful with that lumin it’s Cancerous
Wow, Beautiful
I have that Rolex. Can you restore it for me? For free
I think they forgot to salt my Burger.
How much does a rebuild on a watch like this cost?
Amazing!
My grandfather has an old omega seamaster, probably from the 50s, and the crown has been changed at some point. Any idea how i can rectify that? I live in Sri Lanka
Would this drop the value of the watch?
if you really restore it is it really worth  100k? or is it just a fake?
We didn’t get to see the bezel turn.  😢
All I can say is WOW . . .
Amazing!  I’d love to wear something like it everyday, as well.  But I have a Casio budget.😭
This is when people only had one watch that they cherished and loved nowadays people have more than three or four in their collection they will never have this kind of patina
you are insane if you charged any less than $3000 labor +parts cost for that work
How do you keep track of where each screw came from to return it to it's proper location?
Amazing work 👍🥰👍 A lot of experience from what I see  💝
The Best Watch resto channel online barr none, thank you sir for all the time and effort in producing such fantastic watch repairs and resto's. 👍👍👌👌🦘🦘✌✌
Greetings and respect for the skillz from the Worldtown of Watches, Biel-Bienne Switzerland 👊🏼
Is in fact also a 900 or 120 euro old shit Rolex. No doubt, its only that people pay that. For the rest: no. Forget it. But people believe that, okay. Ofcourse I respect the history and mechanical solidity of Rolex, but ...You know? Money is buying exclusivity and I know. Have fun lads.
Amazing! How and how makes these tiny parts?
100,000.00 US??? Why???
Great video. Fastest 52 minutes on YouTube.
What a video, man !  It's a dream coming true for me too.  I never saw the inside mechanism of a so hi-class watch like this !  It's a really beautiful MASTERPEACE !
Nice work as usual! Stunning angles and camera work
Love the vids.  Keep them coming!  And that bezel?  Almost looks like it got exposed to heat?
Great restoration and your website looks great!
My fiancé worked at a nursing home and there was a gentleman there that had a relatively nice watch. I had seen a few videos like this and after noticing his watch one day and how dirty it was I took it home and cleaned it for him, replaced the battery and made sure everything was working properly and return it to him. He was so happy and so excited to see that watch and every time the light would catch it he would smile and talk about it. It was really a rewarding experience. He passed away about five months after that and gave her the watch. I've always thought that wound make an amazing series of vids not to mention just be an amazing thing to do for people that really need something nice done for them not to mention the human interaction.  Anyway, just wanted to share that story and idea. Really enjoyed this video brother.
This watch is so pretty inside amazing how you can remember how to put it back together again. I’m amazed if I tried to do this I’d end up with a ziplock of parts and a sorry letter to the owner hahaha! This is amazing stuff!
Wow amazing work you did Congratulations.
He was a big sweaty man with some caustic sweat
It's stunning!!! Incredible video, incredible performance!
Im glad this watch find you.
Watches are amazing and nothing beats a Rolex ❤  its so fascinating to watch you work on them. I would love to do something like this but my hands shake and id just muck it up. 😅 So ill watch your precise fingers instead.
I’m the proud owner of a GMT Master II in Pepsi Bezel.  My wife bought me the watch as a retirement gift from the USAF in 2003.  I’ve had it sent in for service twice during the past 20 years.   Technically it needs another service but I haven’t worn the watch in years so it lives in my safe.  Sadly every time the watch goes in they replace the bezel.  On these aluminum, pre ceramic bezel, GMTs the red fades very quickly.  The blue doesn’t seem to have the same issue.  I love a Rolex.  While there are many other brands that are far more complicated and expensive, the Rolex is the Gold standard.  Great video Marshall.
That's something else to watch. If it was my grandpa's watch i think i would have kept the cracked crystal on just cause i think it would make a cool story to tell if someone asked I'm a bit sentimental like that as well. Super intriguing video i really enjoyed watching you repair that bit of history.
I have to compliment your talent,patience,stable hands, and emmence knowledge!!!!! I am truly amazed when I watch you work.😊
When he pulled out that geiger counter I was hooked. I had no idea Rolex had radium dials and bezels.
Why would anyone want wear radioactive watch???
Such a lot of small parts wil he know how to put them back
I hope my steeldive lasts this long...
BRAVO !
Vary Captivating
Brilliant really enjoyed your video and respect your sympathetic way to restore owners precious timepieces.
Really enjoyed this! Thanks
You are a master craftsman.  Well done.
So many old master peices ⌚,are utterly destroyed by over cleaning or "restoration". At last some one who knows to leave original masters🖌️🎨 as Original😮
2:30 So anyway your grandfather died of every cancer we have on record...
I can reach nirvana listening to you man; so therapeutic...cool watches are just the cherry on top.
Amazing work, thank you for sharing 👏
excellent work...
I'm new so don't mind my confusion. Does he commentates as he's restoring the watch, or no?  Great videos just confused on that part
this like watching Bob Ross, except interesting.
crazing on that crystal looks like heat damage over many years.
I have to ask….what was the cost for you to do what you did to this watch?
Considering my dexterity, watch making is out of the question.
I could take these apart.  Putting them back together...not so much.
do you have a lead-lined box handy for radium faces? 😊
I know, I know, but the fact that you can completely disassemble it and re-assemble it just blows my mind.
Dear you are a genius.  I think that how u remember that witch screw is where . Waoo 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Small note about the rubies. Molecularly, synthetic rubies are the same as natural rubies. However, they are distinguishable under a microscope because synthetic gems have curved striations whereas natural gems' striations are perfectly straight. This is due to how the gems are "grown" vs formed in nature.
you talk too much
Great restoration, (personally I do not like Rolex watches).
So does the bezel crack easily?
The original crown either had a thinner seal or no seal inside it. You can see that after you scraped the green oxidation in it, did not have any rubber.
My fifty fathoms had the same fractured crystal... could it be from the radium?
What function do to rubies serve?
Question,  how come you do not blow compressed air or hand pumped air on the inside of the crystal and the black faceplate to make sure there is not dust inside the watch?😊
That's why it was in a drawer
As amazing it is to see this watch dismantled, cleaned and reassembled, I am absolutely in awe at the incredible talent, engineering and skill that went into building this watch in the first place. The original craftsmen were simply wizards!
$100k for that watch? Reminds me of something PT Barnum said..
My heart was racing during the entire restoration😮
I am convinced you threw all the parts away and just got a new one aha I can’t comprehend how someone can put all these tiny parts back in the exact right order 😭😂
Wonder if the grandfather died of cancer, that started in his wrist?     The fact he was a grandparent tells us he couldn't have died young, at least.
When is the next video coming out ?
Apart from the beautiful camera work and the dancing cuts between the closeups I also really enjoy your lively narration. It always feels like one is actually looking over your shoulder and being spoiled with all the naming and background infos. Thank you so much for these  YouTube gems! <3
Wow! Totally incredible. Amazing work thanks for sharing.
Yeh that's superb. I'll stick to $50 busted seikos but kudos to you marshall, you've come a long way sir.❤👏
Great video!! Thanks for sharing it!
You need time put that dial in a lead case its nuclear...☠
Never heard you so excited to get your hands on a watch
One comment , it's not "worth" 100,000 dollars , that's just what a group of rich narcissistic men in the last 20 years or so have been collecting and driven the "value" to ludicrous levels !
I admire your skill and eyesight. If it was me , i would not know how to put it back together, if i took it apart.  The owner probably died from cancer caused by the radiation from the watch.
I winced so hard at 8:25 Can’t really even understand why you kept it in.
I was mesmerized with this video.   I had to watch it twice to take in everything.   Thank you for making it.
I’m in, subbed
Hi Marshal l have this watch for a while it’s working and it’s been cleaned like 3years ago ,it’s called Bertmar calendar the problem is the two mobs are missing you think it’s worth repairing thanks 1:55
I still dont understand why watches are so expensive today do to how easy it is to make them in todays world but that's just me. I love watches and wear one everyday. I have several different types some handed down and some I have purchased over the years. I want to say one thing I'm never going to pay 5 grand for a watch I just don't see the value in that but that's just me people do what they like it's not my business how people spend there money. I have several Rolex that are old two from my grandfather and a few from my dad. I love vintage watches too. i enjoyed your video.
I cannot tell you how much I was blown away by the consummate skill and professionalism that you have displayed in the restoration of this stunningly fabulous watch. Thank you for making and sharing this video. I would award you many Oscar awards for this. Thank you.
Such a great restoration bringing a classic back to life
Do you work on timex watches ?
Hi Marshall, love your videos. Question - do you work on ladies older Timex watches? I have two that were my mother's watches. One looks likes from the '80s from looking at the font on the dial, the other one I can't tell. If so, please let me know how to get in contact with you. Thanks, Tee
bravo!
Before my grandfather passed he gave me his vintage 1960's Zodiac Sea Wolf. The case and dial are in good condition however the movement is stuck, he had it sitting in a drawer for YEARS. How can I get in contact with you so that you can work on it? I think it would be an amazing video as I haven't seen a Sea Wolf being restored here.
Awsome ,I enjoy your video.
Love how your using an mtg playmat 😊
love your videos. Just wondering what manufacturers typically charge to service watches like Rolex and do you think, its worthwhile to send your watch to them over say a local watch servicing company?
Would love to see a video on DIY watch kits and if they're any good
Once again now I've watched till the end.. you are one serious craftsmen god bless you 😮😮
Wow totally fascinating really really interesting thanks pal 👍
You are the best!
Any chance you work on BMWs?
Running out of time
If I wasn't told the that watch glass was crystal I'd swear it was polycarbonate purely because the stuff cracks exactly like that from solvent exposure. Only material where I've seen that kind of cracking pattern before this.
Going big is impressive, burj khalifa and all that. But what is really impressive is going small. The fact that there are people who are capable of designing, manufacturing and assembling these mechanical marvels is what impresses me most. Also, fantastic to see all (at least some) tricks and tools from the trade, makes me go “damn, that’s smart!” every time. Thanks for posting your videos.
I think the crystal could have developed that pattern as a result of the radon luminescence emitting radionuclide.   I've seen similar fracturing in quartz around titanite.
How many parts have a ŕolex?
Excellent. Nice to see such respect and care given to a true appreciating classic Rolex. Mine still functions well and am reticent to service. Thank you
A person with a whole lot of patience
Fascinating video.  Loved it.  Can I ask why you don’t also polish the watch body or clean the face?  Would that add to the value or is it better not to and keep the patina?
A click on the like cannot express my admiration of this .  I must confess.
Would be terrified to wear it myself.  Would probably end up back in a drawer/safe or get sold off, unfortunately.  I’d be livid with myself if I bumped it on something and ruined the bezel
Masterful restoration! Just curious, what's the cost of restoration on a magnificent piece like this? So it's worth 100k after restoration?
I can relate in a way. Working on priceless things or things that mean everything to the owner can be extremely intimidating. In the early 80's I worked as a car detailer and PDI technician at a new car dealership. The owner was a really tough customer. Not a very nice guy. His father owned an original, unrestored 1953 Corvette and brought it to the dealership to have it cleaned and detailed prior to a very prestigious car show he was taking it to the following week. I have no idea which show he was taking it to. They brought it out to me, told me not to screw anything up, turned and left. 10 hours of constant sweat and terror later I had the car done. They walked around it for at least 20 minutes before the father nodded and had some guys load it on a trailer. He then turned to me, smiled and handed me 3 crisp new one hundred dollar bills. I was a bit shocked but grateful none the less. The guy never said a word to me the whole time. I remember seeing a car like that sell on Barrett Jackson Auctions for over two million!
The owner must have been like "I have a ROLEX and by god I'm gonna wear it til I die!" 😂
It looks like any $100 watch. Even though i understand and appreciate what it actually is, it looks like an other watch to the untrained eye.
Absolutely fascinating to watch you do this.  I'm 66yo and remember as a kid looking at the insides of my watch and just being in awe of how it was put together.  Watching you restore this beautiful piece made my day.  Thank you!
Thank you for posting this. It’s one of the most satisfying things I’ve seen in a long time. Master craftsman at work.
How do you know where all the parts go for assembly?  Do you have drawings.
Gave me anxiety just of thinking how he would remember where each part would go when he puts the watch back together…😖
I’m always amazed by the craftsmanship of the people who originally designed and built these engineering masterpieces.
WOW, amazing watch and thanks for showing it's guts !
It sat in a drawer since 1997, the last time anyone needed a watch.. I don't get why people wear them today nor why anyone would buy a expensive one..
Amazing!
Hello Marshall! Where can i find your contact info? Im wondering if you could do some work to a Tag monaco... id love for you to work on for me. Please let me know if this would be of any intrest to you. Thanks
How do you keep track of where everything go to put it back together? I would have to take a thousand pictures
The way the crystal cracked is an indication that it was some type of plastic, not glass...!!!
Who would pay that for this???
Do you service unusual Seiko dive watches?  I have one I treasure that has the mechanical depth meter built in and in preparation to pass to my son I'd like to serviced/repaired as necessary.  Thank you for any response.
I know nothing about watches, and I’m hooked! It’s fascinating! Your explanations, the editing and video quality are superb!
I have a TAG HEUER aquaracer ref. CAF1111 but I can't find any stem,crown and tube that match it.
Riveting loved this video
Very nice
My hands are nowhere near as steady as they would need to be to do this job. Very interesting stuff. I’m intimidated by the job just watching.
it must suck when you drop a piece
You have to be crazy to manipulate that whatch on your bare work table without covering everything with plastic and wearing respirators. Even a single spec of radium if ingested or contacted the eye can leave you with permanent health issues... I really hope you are lucky and ok.
Marshall, I really enjoy your videos. I wonder if it would be possible for you to service/restore my old Citizen that my grandfather gifted me. The link broke and it has been sitting in my drawer for about 15 years or so. Now of course it it stuck on "stop"  I know it isn't a fancy watch by any means but would love to be able to wear it again. I tried to find somewhere to contact you directly but no luck 😢
With that skillset you deserve to have a watch like that and deserve to afford one but in today’s society you have to have a YouTube channel
Sarai anche bravo ma potresti evitare di parlare così tanto? Non riesco a seguire bene, alla fine fai venire il mal di testa!!!!
Sooooo cool! Great content!
This has to be the most relaxing 52 minutes anyone can watch.  Thanks x
Nice Job Marshall !!👍
Subscribed! wow.. a pleasure to watch, thank you! Helps inspire my restorations of various things.
So, let me know if I get this straight. A 100k for a plastic radioactive watch? No, thank you.
Great job!  I really like your videos.  I did comment on another video about how you can properly align the threads of a screw so you don't cross thread them.  I hope that is something that you find interesting and will incorporate into your work in the future.
Well eff wearing that watch I'll skip out on the radiation
That was the most satisfieing video in a long time.
Now I get why they get so $$$$$.Insane  micrometrics !
I have a 1989 GMT master II. Rolex told me it will cost $5000 to restore the innerd’s from moisture / shower damage. Super bummed as that was the OG purchase price.  So i have had it in a drawer for 5 years.
how unhealthy to wear radioactive watch?
I am a mechanic by trade and I have a ton of respect for what you do sir. That takes alot of skill and patience to do.
Silicone grease is a poor metal to metal lubricant…all lubricants attract dirt and I’d argue as someone who sells lubricants and plays with watches as a hobby while tempting to lube that bezel and have a nice ‘smooth’ click any grease not only over time will it accumulate dirt and ultimately compromise bezel movement but worse by facilitating the turning of the bezel any grease risks defeating the purpose of said bezel to mark a time interval by increasing the likelihood it will move by accident….
Yeah! A jewellers draw.😁😁😁
I wore all 3 of my Rolex until they ceased to run. My Bi Metal 1996 sub ran 10 years. My Milgauss 2014 GV 9 years  Both now sold for a profit  My 2000 Sea Dweller 14years Serviced and still owned
Wonderful and so interesting.. How much did this service cost for the watch?
Wonderful watching your expertise. I wish I could do this but my eye sight wouldn’t cope or my general ability … 😂
Very impressive workmanship.
i've never seen a watch restoration video. Loved every second of your restoration. Outstanding work and comentary. Thanks.
I hate Rolex
That was truly amazing to watch. Thankyou sir. Great work
How can i get into contact with you about having you service a watch for me?
Fabulous restoration.  The moment the back case came off was like revealing a piece of magic inside.  Looked so pristine for a 1958 watch
would love to know your age. Your voice is "mature" but your hands still look young!  LOVE your site.
Just throw it in the trash where it belongs 😂
Just amazing watching your work. Well Done.
horrible horrible horrible. coming from a trained watchmaker.
Should replace the crown and tube together - also use high strength loctite for the stem.
Any response from the owner? Itd be cool to see if they had thought to share after seeing this. Im sure id have a lot to say
Thomas Magnum likes this element.
Another great video bruv 👍🏻
Splendid! Now if only I can find one in the back of a drawer.
I have friends that are wrist watch snobs. I love to lift my sleeve and and tell them thy got screwed on there expensive watches. My used $15 Timex indiglo keeps just as good time as any watch made. I set it years ago and never had to reset it again. PS I drive used vehicles also. I have nothing to prove to anyone
great job sir 😉 ❤
Mustard???!!! Lets not be silly!
Wife's toothbrush always works the best!
This guy should’ve been a neurosurgeon.
How can he remember where everything goes?
I like how he can read minds 😄. In 19:15 I thought to myself wont the bunched up parts scratch each other? and in 20:41 He just answers the question I had in my mind.
Thank you for sharing a great video of an amazing watch. True craftmanship, kudos!
I have a 63 no date Submariner. I had it serviced in Dallas by Rolex. $1K. New crystal, bezel & internal oiling. I had a new factory band put on years ago. The watch looks great. interesting that a Rolex retailer in Carmel, CA, told me the watch lost value because I had it serviced, even though by Rolex. Hmmmmm.
hey man I love your channel but do get concerned with your use of steel divers on steel, as you can see you left a cut on the engine turning, not deliberate but not cool either
Did the owner have it appraised/insured? This watch is a "survivor" -- not perfect but original and complete.
Ya did good kid! I have a mid 70's GMT. I had a master watch maker clean it up this year, although it ran fine. He last cleaned it about 25 years ago... so it was due. On the case I had him remove the biggest scratches only... and it is perfect. I wish I had that Bakelite bezel though.. I didn't even know they did that in Bakelite. It takes a lot of trust on their part so your rep must be outstanding!!
51:40 The Mercedes hand goes faster and overtakes the GMT hand
love to see a video where you narrate from watch perspective, as usual great restoration.
Well, you did a magnificent job. As regards to the watch in its original state.......as you said, we know nothing about its history. It could have been worn every day to hell and back from the sands of Saudi Arabia to the jungles of Vietnam.....we just don't know. I'm sure the owner took care of it as best as he was able to do so.  I, being a perfectionist, would have liked to see the watch to be in better shape, but, after all, I'm sure the owner's grandfather bought the watch as a tool to be used, not as a piece of jewelry to sit in a display case.
When I sharpen my knives I like to put my iPad on the bench and watch videos. I can usually get 3 or 4 done in a little less than an hour, about the same length as your video here. Just happened to stumble across your channel and picked this video to watch. When it was over I still had the first knife in my hand without a single sharpening stroke on it. I was riveted! My wife said I looked like my grandson when his favorite movie comes on. Excellent job!
If I took something like this apart, no way Id be able to put it back together without explicit instructions! I can see why working on watches is something you enjoy. Watching that balance just kick in like that was very satisfying to watch happen.
A few minutes in.  I'm looking at all them parts thinking  yep. I could never put it back together.       Then he makes quick, easy work of it.
Impressive , I get stressed just changing the Battery in my Car Remote..
What is the danger of the wearer of the watch getting radiation poisoning?
Simply amazing ..
I’m not a watch maker but I am a  material's engineer and I feel you had plenty of opportunity to go a lot deeper into cleaning that Bakelite bezel. It's a far more durable material than you’d think . But it’s still an amazing before and after.
How do you machine the shaft that holds the seconds hand @ 12:57, the mind boggles.
I know nothing about watchmaking and it was fascinating watching you take this completely apart.   How do you keep track of all the screws and what goes where?  Anyway I'm amazed to watch people with skills doing interesting things – skills that I don't have.   Why this  grandfather never had this nice watch serviced is beyond me.
*The ending time-grapher--is very important.*
Incredible work, from you're watch work to your video production and of course your narration. Absolutely top notch.
Why am i watching this at 2 in the morning, it's beyond me...
I don't believe radium is dangerous.
Phenomenal work! 👍🏻👌🏼👏🏻🏆🥇 I felt your nervs! 😉
Riveted for 52 minutes and 25 seconds.   Truly refreshing, taking a vacation and never leaving home! Thank you.
Good that you have kept the radium. I have seen others replace it. But thats not the original watch then.
Me too
Some of my watch 'crystals'  (MUCH less expensive though) craze cracked like that, others did not, those that did craze crack were those I wore when working. I installed, repaired, and was a factory field engineer for medical X-Ray imaging systems.  I took my watch off often for timing things, leaving it on the X-Ray table nearby where it routinely got X-Rayed. It seems that the plastics are deteriorated by radiation, that one has been exposed by it's radioactive dial, mine from routine blasts of ionized radiation.😁 👍🇺🇸😎

Beautiful
He makes it look so easy, I’ve just taken an oyster in for repair that I was using but just stopped. Quoted £475 from local jewellers and thought I’d try a little guy but his price was £1000 minimum. Don’t mind paying but feel I’m being robbed there. Wish I could find someone like this in England. If it was like this and worth £100k I’d be happy to pay but when it’s worth about £2k half of its value is silly.
It’s a wonder what happens when you get caught in the “YouTube Rabbit hole”.   I have now seen a bunch of these and can’t ge enough and have learnt so much.  Thanks much Marshall.    I have my own story,  my dad got a Simple Rolex in the late 1970s from a tenant at a building where he was the superintendent.  The watch was not running of course but the owner JC, no longer wanted it and since my dad had done some work for him and used to admire the watch thought he might want it.   Dad had gone to a jeweler but was told that it was going to cost a few hundred dollars to fix.  Well in the 1970s that was a lot of money and he just put the watch in a drawer.   Four years ago when I was moving our parents closer to us I saw the watch and asked my mom if I could take it and surprise my dad by getting it fixed.   The bevel was scratched, the watch did not work and the back cover had the inscription JC 1952.   I took it to a recommended jeweler, he replaced the bevel, replaced the back and the watch came back working but I noticed it was always 5 minutes off per day. I gave it to my dad for Christmas three years ago when he was 89 and he cried with happiness.   After all those years and he could finally wear it.   Dad died the following year and I inherited the watch and just put it in my safe.   Since watching your videos I now notice that the watch does not work.   I wish I could get it fixed and would love a recommendation in my area.
First time watching a watch taken apart and reassembled.  Mesmerizing.  Been a surgeon for three decades and I finally understand why my attendings would tell me "We aren't building a watch here" if I was taking too much time and attention with part of a procedure.  I mean, what could be more demanding than neurosurgery or vascular surgery?  Building a watch, obviously.  I found it humorous when you, after having disassembled, cleaned, and partially reassembled a watch with many tiny, delicate parts described the placement of the gasket into the bezel recess as "particularly difficult".  Did not look any more demanding than all the other steps, but I will take your word for it.  Either way, love the attention to detail and amazed at the steadiness of your hands.
Ever worried about growing an extra finger or something after exposure to radiation? Lol 😅
I have no interest in watches. But your video was truly fascinating.  I couldn't stop watching it. It was SO satisfying to watch you work on this truly amazing watch.  Well done!!  Thank you. I'm checking out your website next.  Again... Thanks.
This is so relaxing to watch
Hah! "Born to fly spring"
that utc hand was super useful in my opinion. I am seeing it for the first time.
Just watching this to fill time while eating, but oh man how this is entertaining. I've watched first 15 minutes but it feels like just 5 min passed. Even without music, the naration is nice to ear. And I love that camera setup, everything looks good.
Love the GMT, I have worn one for 30+ years.
True therapy
Good Job!         Really,,,,,,,Best I've ever seen.
You are a master craftsman. You are a storyteller of this craft. Such a teacher
Most amazing watch love it !!
I have a Meister Anker watch that was a gift from my step father, and one of the dials fell out and got stuck with the minute dial (and it bended it), is there something I can do about it? I took it to a watch "expert" before  the minute dial got bended by the small dial bended the minute one, so it can be fixed. It fell out again then bended the minute one. I`m sorry for my bad english and explanation, but I really want it fixed and I could not find anyone (except scam shops extorting a fortune) in Romania. I`m paying whatever it takes, it is a family gift and it is worthless for me.
Fascinating program.  How can I contact you about repairing two vintage Gallet watches?  My husband, a former pilot, would love to wear them again.  They are circa 1950s.  If you do not want to help, can you refer me to anyone who will.
Mr. Marshall, have you ever heard abou a wrist watch named "organa" ?
I have a later model GMT MASTER  probably born in the 70’s or early 80’s and I believe it was a reconditioned watch at first I kept time flawlessly but now when I wear it any vibration will make it stop and it’s been look at a couple of times and not corrected. Rolex won’t look at it because I changed the band on it any suggestions. Anything recommendations would be greatly appreciated Thank You
Hopefully the owner kept the original crystal and all other parts !
Who tf came up with putting together these million parts to make a watch????!!!
Holy sht. So many parts!!
Do you know of a reputable Hamlton repair shop in los angeles, ca? Or can I send my watch to you for repair? The crystal is broken and hands are misaligned.
what about that scratch on 18:32??
What a GeM …. Never thought I would geek out over a watch but dang this thing is a beauty.. great job
Haha. Idk why but I find it funny that the bezel insert on this Rolex is made from the same kind of plastic that the original M16s used for the buttstock/pistol grip when Colt first introduced it to the military back in what, 1959, I think. I'm sry, the M16 was designed in 59' but wasn't in production until 63'. I only have one Rolex and the only reason I own it is because it belonged to a family member who meant the world to me. tbh, it was serviced once and since then the damn thing has lived in a watch winder for the past 20 years. If it hadn't belonged to my grandfather I wouldn't keep it simply because I think Rolex is overpriced garbage tbh but its the only thing I have left from my grandfather so I cant bring myself to part with it. Personally I feel my red garnet Formex Essence 39 is built better, looks a lot nicer and is also COSC certified just like Rolex is and my Formex only cost about 20 times less (costs me $1600 total) than a Rolex GMT does today. another plus is my Formex is only gonna cost about $500 for a basic service (actually free for me since I'm more than capable of doing my own service on a Sellita Sw200-1 movement and already own all the proper oils I need for that particular movement) whereas a basic service on a Rolex is what, like $3k?
Awesome work. Great clip. Thank you for sharing it 🙏🌹❤️
Takes 432 days at CPM of 100 to up your chance of getting cancer to odds of 1 in 1,000...but just 4 days at 10,000cpm
Had couple of those throw them in the bin, well was all messed up and didn't work and radioactive.
But we all know most the restoration on YouTube are fake
You sir are a joy to "watch", and to listen to!
$100,000.....that's just stupid!
It's a real joy to hear the inspiring talk while working on the watch.
what makes a watch 100 K worth ??
Great job! It just hurt me a little to see it scratching at 18:32 lol
This was really satisfying to watch.  Omega is servicing my watch and I balked at their estimate.  I begrudgingly approved the work, but after watching this, I can appreciate the care that goes into a good service.  I hope they are half as careful and thorough as this gentleman is.
Your Lubeta says it expired in November :)
just amazing 👍🤩
Dear Youtbe what the hell am i watching? and why cant i stop??
You, Sir, are amazing!  And watching you restore that GMT was a privilege and a marvel.  Thank you for sharing your skills and that beautiful piece!  Your episodes are just fantastic.
I think people should know that you charge people extra on Patreon  I offered you what I can afford and I was charged double, please refund full amount.  People check you bank account
Omg, there's not many Alex Hansen's in the world. Tell him a Bahá'í friend he knows said hi.
You sir have a lot of patience
I have a 1675 from 1967. My clasp is much smaller on the bracelet. Supposed to let the watch fit better under the pilot’s cuff. Your replacement bracelet’s clasp seems to be bigger as if from a from a Sub. Or is it correct for the period?
Pro
I Take my hat off to you Sir. A fine running recording and insight into the overhaul of this fine GMT, I commend you on your skill and retaining the patina keeping its original used and worn history i totally get why you decided on this wise decision, I am a collector of vintage watches kind regards from the UK.
Words can't describe the craftsmanship displayed here.
It’s always a good time coming back to watch your videos
Question, shouldn't you put it on the time Grapher and make final adjustments with the hands on? Don't they add a bit of a load on the movement?
I think the Crystal was so bad because the radiation degraded the crystal over time!
Always great to see a watch that has seen heavy use like it was supposed to
Thank you for calling it the “seconds hand” and not “second hand.” Unfortunately I have an ear for improper pronunciation and my OCD normally goes into overdrive consuming 99% of modern content.
Non watchmaker/tech, If the bezel was Bakelite seems likely Rolex didn’t shy from newer less traditional materials in other areas. That said, the damage pattern on the crystal looks like crazing. Sometimes it results from material incompatibility or chemical exposure.
I cannot understand how anyone would pay that price for a watch. None of them are worth more than $100 to me. Sorry.
Hi like your vids would go on smart watch
FAB !!!!
fantastic, love that bezel too!
You are extremely talented. I love watching your videos.
It would have been cool to see the reaction of the customer when getting it back!!
Marshall, you never fail to amaze me! Thank you for yet another delightful viewing experience :)
I have a gmt 2 that want you to help me with and I send you instagram message
I cringed when he grabbed the jewel directly rather the metal section
Marshall,  you are a brave man.  I wouldn't have changed the strap on that unit ;>
Probably the finest specimen
Why do you wear finger condoms rather than just gloves?
love your videos sir, keep it up. very informative as well as entertaining to  watch
This watch movement ( components) discontinued : no parts! That’s why  price went up so much
Dood needs to lay off the cigarettes
I just will never understand how these watches cost so much. Missed an opportunity for brand merch on your site.
This was incredible to watch, and really well explained. Thank you
the ruby bearings should glow in ultraviolet light.
Your kindness and compassion light up the world. In a world sometimes filled with chaos, your heartwarming presence reminds us that there's still immense goodness and love. Thank you for being a beacon of light and warmth in this often challenging world. You make a profound difference just by being you.
Wow! I envy you that you were able to hold such a rare piece in your hands. Rolex is ALWAYS an investment
He forgot to oil the crown after the ultrasonic
He fixed that up like clockwork!
GMT = Greenwich Mean Time: My guess is that the second hour hand was for the hour at GMT. We navigators always worked in GMT and local time was just used for (depending on location) the ships location, meals, changing of the watch, etc.
Very well done indeed 👍🏽 Salute ! ✨
Why would anyone pay one hundred grand for this ? Such a disappointment.  If I package up my poop would someone pay one hundred grand for it ? No? Why not  this is kinda the same thing.
Najz
just put on gloves this looks so fk gay
Unbelievable finesse on your part sir!  How can you know how to put this watch all back together again not alone how to disasemble it with all of those small custom tools???!!!  I have great admiration & respect to you & your expertise!  And thanks for all the history & knowledge shared concerning this Rolex watch!  WOW!
Don't restore you ruin value
Very nice
Nice restoration, but still you gotta wonder what numbnut would waste 100 K on a pice of old junk like that. Guess the worlds last fool isn't born yet.
I'm shocked to see the radiation dosage per hour.
If you replace any part of the watch, can it reduce the value of the watch?
How did we make it, before the adverb "as well", started being used. Count the number of times it was used in this video. Also, too or in addition, could have been used.
Out of interest, what would a restoration like this cost?
LPL has nothing on this guy
This is very interesting to watch (no pun intended😁).   How the heck do you know which parts go where, when you reassemble the watch?
Arn’t these worth more unrestored?
Really well explained. You have a voice for radio. And that's such a cool piece of history.
Slightly OT, how do you identify old Rolex's? The wife inherited one from her Grandmother, it comes with the box and book but just says 'Rolex Precision' and doing a Google image search shows nothing that looks like her one.
"The spring just kinda springs back into place here." Yah, sure.
U sound like Neil deGrasse Tyson, idk if its the pitch of ur voice or maybe the slight accent .
This whole process amazes me... such steady hands. Should of been a brain surgeon.
The dial being refinished decreased the value by how much?
Excuse me, but do you have a system for how you place the parts when you disassemble the mechanism, or do you know every part by memory? I mean, when I work on engines I have to place everything in orderly rows to make sure I put it back together in the right order....,
i wish i could send you my grandfathers pocket watch to see you get it running properly agian,  wanted to do that for a fathers day gift
And I thought 1968 was the first year for this watch....wow.
It might have already been said but the cracking in the crystal is actually crazing from the radiation emissions of the dial and hands. In 1961 Rolex was sued for $5.6m by USN Lt Cmdr Willard M Mound for damages to his skin and eyes which he claimed was caused by the radiation from his Rolex 6542. In the early 60’s watch brands stopped using radium and replaced it with the far less radioactive Tritium based materials.
Water is the most powerful  solvent. . Dawn dish soap upstairs it power
What's the + and - on the balance  wheel . What's that for . Is that too Chang how the watch keeps time ?
Click spring . Now I know wear that name came from
that would be a hard one to send back!!!!
Watching you take this apart I now know why Rolex Subs cost $20k. WOW. Can't even imagine how these were actually designed and produced in the 1950s...
Hey, Marshall -- great job!  Snapping that bakelite bezel on took way more courage than I have!  I did some watch repair awhile ago, got a cal1030 Rolex to service from a friend.  With unmitigated creativity I managed to bend the balance spring, ouch!  Used balance complete on eBay, about $1000.  I learned the very hard way!  Be careful.  The price of this watch, well, I'll pass on that repair!  Nice job, again.
Great work, rescuing a true classic!
If I had a $100k that's one of the few notable Rolexes I'd like...
The owner of that watch wasn’t in a Vietnamese prison camp, I hope…..but seriously great work on a beautiful piece.
Bravo! on both the watch and the restoration
Bro you’re pulling in 2M views I got no doubt in my mind you can afford the watch 🫡
man that's a hotrod.
Cool
Just curious....is it worth more after the gentle restoration or was it would be worth more to a collector as original?
Caught myself holding my breath and feeling my heart race more than a few times along with you, absolutely awesome work!
Cool watch!! Movement looks like the Original Tudor Subs. Fleurer.
Nice video.
Ive seen crystals crack like that if its been sitting in the sun for years,  i wish this watch could talk so i could hear its story.
Love your videos Marshall. Random thought, but your voice would be awesome for narrating true crime stories.
Marshall I have some watches that i am trying to find out about.   How can i get in contact with you?
Amazing work, Marshall. From an LR fan. ❤❤❤
Having worked in a watch face company in NW Switzerland years ago I'm impressed with your skills.
Is that a " colonel kurtz" / Brando in apocalypse now? Minus the bezel of course
What an incredible talent you have sir it’s a pleasure watching you
Mesmerising.
Awesome to watch
Impressive!!
hello, i have a vintage Eterna baby pilot chronograph with valjoux 69 movement, but the condition is need to repair and restoration
Had a really great time with you on this video. We'll done..
I am really enjoying your videos and how you explain what you are doing as you go along, your videos are a combination of entertainment, education, and in a way, meditation. I love the idea of your watch restoration hobby, but seeing the disassembled watch parts would give me an anxiety attack when trying to put it back together. Also, in the wide camera angle shots, the screws look like dust, you're reassembling a tiny machine with dust particles.  😄
Bakelite is a thermoset plastic not a thermoplastic. They are both plastics. Thermosets like Bake-a-lite, epoxy and polyester resins cannot be remoulded. However, thermo plastics can be remoulded. Like ABS, PVC Polycarbonate (PC). Uses for thermosets, pool balls, pot handles, camp dishes and cups, old electrical outlets, fiberglass boats etc. I could go on and on. Don't want to bore anyone.
Hi Marshall, first I just have to say how much I enjoy your video’s. I always wanted to be a watch repaired but was never able to do it. I am 77 years old and have a Omega wristwatch I purchased new about 1970 in Italy. It runs fine  and keeps good time but the watch has never had a service. What sort if price in your opinion would I have to pay to have the watch stripped cleaned and lubed? Many thanks and kind regards if you have time to answer. Rob
Hi Marshall, I've really enjoyed this video and your other video with a GMT Master. I also recently inherited a GMT Master from my grandfather who was a merchant marine in the 60s and 70s. You must be asked this quite frequently, but how can I reach out regarding a restoration (if you're interested in showing on the channel)? Thank you again for sharing your knowledge and passion on this channel!
I enjoyed.. watching this 😏
I noticed the watch you’re wearing is the Pepsi cola GMT, it’s the same watch I have.  I also need a cleaning.
The time zone is ZULU pilots and military use!
Extraordinary skills. I watched every second of your video in amazement. Very well done, bravo!
Great job!  I enjoyed your work.  I have a gold Rolex that was owned by the actor, Glenn Ford.  I have had it worked on and runs great.
Do you pressure test your crystals / cases when you put them back together? I enjoy your work.
Nice work.  My dad was a jeweler for 40 years. I watched him repair many many watches. Takes a lot of patience for sure.  These days he sends his Rolex out for service. He says it's so much easier. Lol.  Last time the repairman yelled at him for not insuring it properly.   Doh!!
السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته  ما شاء الله تبارك الله  الله يعطيك العافيه وشغل ممتاز ومرتب 👌
Thanks!
Cleaning the bezel with a fat resolving liquid (most of the dirt would be organic) might've made the removal easier?
I like to watch people perform their duties in whatever profession/ hobby of their choosing... this however gave me anxiety. I mean how do you remember how to put all that back together???
Did I notice you wearing your own GMT while servicing this unicorn?
Wow, a 1958 Rolex!   That must have blown people away when it came out.
Talk too much, tired, i turned off volume
The radium is only really dangerous if you ingest it. Less than one mR/hr on contact is pretty low. I’d wear that all day every day! Just wouldn’t sleep with the crystal against my face.
I feel lucky if I can put my kid’s bike together out of the box. How you do all this fascinates me. How you know where each screw and gear go after you take them apart is just mind boggling to me. I appreciate all the training you acquired and how you put it to good use. I know this video was probably edited down to an hour. How long do you think this took you take apart, clean and put back together? Thank you for a very interesting video.
I repair watches as well, but I love watching theses videos because they are instructional, accurate, and extremely informative. I’m no where near your level, but I “geek” out on this stuff!
I never stop being amazed about the marvelous engineering of these old watches. A job well done
I really don’t like Rolex watches, mainly because of their cult fashion/status (I purposely avoid all fashions and cults such as Porsche, Harley Davidson and Rolex), but also because, as an engineer, I find aluminum or aluminium to be less than an ideal material for any part of a watch case.   And yet, despite the fact that Bakelite seems even less suited to the task, here it literally wins the show. That thing is just gorgeous!  I’m not at all biased of course. The fact that this watch was made the same year I was born has nothing whatsoever to do with it…👀🧐😎😜  Awesome video as always. Thank you for sharing.
Beautiful watch and restoration!
Just put on gloves
Amazing video as usual. Could you please let me know the set of screwdrivers that you are using? Do they come with that rotating base or is it a separate piece? If you could send me a link I would appreciate it.
Lovely.
I'm glad you know what you're doing, and you're familiarity with the inner workings of a rolex—or watches in general—has built-in such a high level of self-confidence to just set about the collections of pieces all willy-nilly and without any kind of cohesive rhyme or reason like you did, lol.  It gave me some serious anxiety after I realized I'd already lost track of what went where following the second bridge!  Nicely done, though.  Very relaxing watch 😉👍
Good job, very very good!!!!!!
A watch surgeon.  Well done doctor!
NIIICE  ! 😊
What just hit me was the thought of the machine work to make all those fragile parts.
I thought red Loctite was the strong one.
Such an incredible watch and watching you restore it was amazing. The deep black with blue and red contrast is incredible!
Rolex are rather ugly watches.  Not my style.  If I ever found one I would sell for cash  Liked your video though.  Great to watch your skill
Excellent explanation of all of the parts of the Rolex movement - I have never seen this before. The customer must be thrilled with the final result. Well done!
Nice,,,,,,,,,,,,Real nice video,,,,,,,,,Thank You !!!
The cracking in the crystal kind of makes it look like plastic.
Not sure why but I love watching your videos always been a fan of mechanical things I guess.  I remember my dad bought me a seiko watch in 1968, I was 7 at the time.  I was mesmerized by that watch.  Unfortunately, I list that that watch but it started my love for finer watches.  I currently own a Rolex Submariner, I bought it as a retirement gift to myself.....somehow i was lured back out of retirement.....not sure what i will buy for my second retirement gift.....I'm thinking a 1968 Seiko....
Amazing!
Nice work. Good camera shots. I enjoyed watching this.
Love when people wear and abuse these master pieces. Well Loved and amazing!
Bakelite was used from the 1930's in Germany in military and civilian manufacturing.
Good job,
That is some good work there! Looks awesome. I did think you would use an ultra sonic cleaner for the insides though, any reason why not?
Okay, I broke out into a sweat when he removed the bezel, crystal, and the back. I've experienced some problems working with corroded watches myself. Whew! Edit: Don't sneeze friend, don't even breathe hard.
Amazing
Great work... I'm really intrigued by the teeny tiny parts and how the hell Rolex was manufacturing such miniscule screws and gems back in the 40s and 50s.  The degree of precision is almost superhuman...
Im a huge fan of your channel, great job on these restorations!!
Man I love that judge!
Oh the dexterity!!!!
Do you repair Seiko auto wind watches?
Maybe one of the two boxes can be facing the bathroom ?
This stresses me out just watching this 😂
This watch may have been made by my grandfather, he was one of the 3 Rolex watchmakers in Switzerland, but I'm not sure what year.
Your video is just fine to watch, I am just picking up the trade I did work for a jewler as a young man about 13 yrs or so, I was good at repairing pocket watches and old grandfather clocks. but at 75 I need to keep my brain working, It seems watches and various timepieces are great to work on. I will watch more of your video's great commentary too.
Hi I have a Bourbon 23rd Swiss watch from around the '60s I got it when it was not working And when I oppend the unit I found the balance spring had come out from its mount, there is no other damage. But I have no way of finding out how far to wind the balance wheel to maintain movement. Can you advise, please? Tom in ayr Scotland..
Mayo or mayo based dressing on the hotdog?…… 🤮
I am in no way a watch guy, but that video was a piece of art! Total respect for valuing craftsmonship.
Awesome content!
im think the mass cracking of the crystal is actually due to radiation damage over time from the radon released by the paint. it looks the same as what you get on XRD machines.
I have watched a lot of your videos. You sir the way you work, talk and explain your craft is amazing. I appreciate your talent and making these videos available.
What you are not mentioning about the bakerlite is the high probability of asbestos being included in it as a binding agent
Great restoration and very interesting. Your cinematography and voice over are excellent. I wasn’t sure about a long video but I absolutely love your content. Keep up the good work it’s so professional. 👍😃
Watch is now worth less after the restoration than before.
Amazing!!
Yee
Beautiful timepiece
100k giveing likes for this video...nothing to say just PERFECT...🥃
I noticed you didn't mention the massively obvious wear on the plates and on the underside of the oscillating weight. And then probably why...you didn't replace the oscillating weight axle. Wobbly weight still dragging. Its a shame.
That was a cool video!
A+ job very nice watch!
Wonder if grandpa worked with like mechanical stuff or solvents and maybe it's why crystal is weird and so much greasy poo everywhere
What would an estimated cost to repair? a watch of this statue, when your talking a hundred thousand dollar plus watch, compared to a ten thousand dollar watch
Great 'watch work' 'watching', your camera work, sorry.
Shame the dial wasn’t original to the watch
Question: That "glow-in-the-dark" paint with Radium on the dial, how long did Rolex use it in their watches and which year was it that the last watch - by any manufacturer - was produced with Radium on the dial? I would guess in the seventies but I'd like to know more precisely. Thanks!
Your video captivated me from start to finish...thanks for this insight
Im not a Rolex guy but what a lovely timepiece. Great work as well ofc
Fantastic work, shame about the date replacement though 🫤
How did your mate die?.....well, he may have drank that water that had the bezel in.
What is the cleaning fluid? If you said I was too mesmerized to hear. When I was a child I always wanted to watch when there was a disassembled timepiece on the repairman's table in a jewelry store. There was regular maintenance required to watches back in the 1950s. We were in the jewelry store regularly.   I probably threw away some valuable watches when clearing out my parent's home. I remember seeing several Bulova and Omega in a box with bands removed.   I've seen watch crystals marred and cracked exactly like this Rolex. My dad was a farmer. His watch crystals looked the same. I believe it's sun damage. Three quarters of the year my Dad rolled his kaki shirt cuffs up two folds so his watch was exposed to sunlight nine months of the year.   Very entertaining,  thanks! Beautiful piece of art IMO.
so one of the worst watches in the world .. china watches are more accurate .. 195000 $ .. and kids are starving to death .. sure .. see my point ? ..
We are happy as well  😊
coooolll
What was the reason for NOT polishing the case???? I missed the reason. What ever the reason is, I do NOT agree!!!!  That case should have been polished. That is the whole IDEA behind a Rolex.
Good tip for bakerlight is to wait until its at room temp or a warm room to a lesson it from cracking, to colder room and yeah good chance will crack or worse shatter, well this is what i have learnt over the years, great find though, very rare, wow the insides are beautiful & better than expected, is the strap original ? as that can cost loads for original straps

as soon as i saw the mtg playmat, it clicked straight away who's voice this is!!
Totally wrong dial… I guess complete fake or redone.
I am not into watches, but this is a fantastic hobby as well a a skill that you can earn a good living. Thanks for your videos !
It's not Bake-a-Lite. It's just Bakelite. Two syllables.
Have you seen any yet that have a power reserve function?
Bravo!
Blown away at your skill in managing these tiny pieces and getting them back in place. Plus your absolute fanaticism in preserving originality. In 300 years so few if any be left but this might be one.
Beautiful work sir.
what's the price to fix it? $5000?
You have a wonderful voice and demeanor, and I enjoy watching your videos despite not wearing a watch myself (though you may change that eventually). Thank you!  Edit: I thought I recognized your voice, and it turns out that I do actually know it from MTG! You wonderful man.
This video somehow randomly appeared on my feed. M...Marshall? From MTG? Is that really you? I'd know that voice anywhere...dang, the Internet is fun! I had no idea this was your thing.
This is making me want a complicated watch and actually took anxiety away.  Thank you sir.
I was minding my business one day and looked over and this guy had a Tiffany GMT from this era on his wrist. Amazing piece.
Gorgeous!
As a machinist, metal is metal, Acetone or Methyl Ethyl Ketone is good to soak metal parts that have dried up oils, varnishes, O-rings and rubber seals. Alcohol is almost a useless solvent, it barely removes dirt. Dawn dish-washing liquid is more hot than alcohol by a long shot.
Wow have never watched anything like this, and how well you knew all the pieces on the teardown, for me I would have needed a seperate spot for each part.  But a beautiful overhaul and the amount of information given by you is very soothing and educational.
Woow you are an artist.
UFOs are flying that are not so delicate. The human race is so special.
You are amazing...
I do not care where we are. That is harder than splitting the atom.....
Hey just want to say thanks for the inspiration.   I already have too many hobbies to count but you make some great points about this particular hobby.   I actually have a couple of nice but non-working watches in my collection and do aspire to have a *really* nice watch someday, repairing a broken one would be a great way to to do it.
What a fascinating video. 💥 Greetings from England 🇬🇧
Stresses me out how he just puts all those internal parts into those baskets for cleaning! How do you know which screw goes where?!?!
Outstanding!!!
Thank you for sharing your short journey with that beautiful watch👍
"found in drawer" makes it sound like you stole it xd "emptying of full wallet found in pocket!"
This guy is a genius!! How do you know how to work on something you've never seen in real life?
I’m glad this channel was recommended, but my god I have never seen so many commercials in one video in my life. I had to watch at least 12-14 commercials to finish out watching the video. I also went over and followed on IG. Thank you for the awesome video.   I’m hooked now.
Stunning.
I don’t t understand why I keep watching anything watch repair related but I do
What a transformation! Absolutely fantastic video. I love this channel!! Thank you for sharing
So that original crystal is acrylic.  The cracking on it is referred to as crazing.  Plastic all shrink over time and in the case of acrylic it “crazes” creating those fractures.   Just father time marching on.   Really enjoyed this and like you the GMT is my favorite offering from Rolex.   Though something I found out, Longines is the creator of the gmt movement.    Enjoy and thanks for great content.
I must say... a lot😊 I'm so glad to find u here on YouTube. You, are somebody ... it is very interesting to listening your proper explanations. And you take my fears, about not understanding watches in a functional way, away.  So i think i am able to look by myself, in my lovely 1995 Zenith 680 Automatic... it is no "Hexenwerk" we say so in German.  Means, it is work without simsalabim😂 Thanks again for your very nice video  Best regards from Germany 🇩🇪  Marcus
Instead of calling watches well worn I suggest you call them well loved. It sounds nicer. (:
Awesome video
Wth I need to put strike on his channel. HE HYPNOTIZED ME!!! Now I watch he's AMAZING STORY VIDEOS....
Curious, how careful one has to be assuming this is radium paint and potentially dust of it.
Impressive and really nice to follow you.
An hour of my time well spent! love your videos, love the explanation about what you are doing and why, very educational!
Do we have any idea of what that watch cost when it was first sold?
Would the original crown threads be possibly recut, to have the crown the watch came with? Obviously a spare is cheaper, but with some pieces it might be worth it?
Great work! Your vids are fascinating to watch. Thanks
This watch looks way better than those garbage iced out watches rappers be getting
I am amazed with your knowledge and your work which is so delicate! You are also pleasant to listen to! Another "feel good" video!
Definitely would be great to learn about the man that wore it, and aproximately how many years. Quite an inheritance tax impact on such a family story, so most of the time it will just be echoed in a used watch auction.
Looks like it was never Serviced.
- sir  .....amazing  job  on a  real  gem  .....i  hope  you get  lucky  with  (sometimes)  valuable  watches  YAY .......i  love  the  "Winner"  automatic  sub mariner  homage watch .....just  $12  new.....  Thx
What double hunter pocket watch under 3k would anyone recommend?
The lamp by your parts cleaner? Thing is awesome.
How much would it have cost in 1958?
Absolutely gorgeous watch ❤
Rule #1 about "restoring" old Rolexes...  DON'T.  Rollex will keep all the old parts, and you just killed the collector value of the watch.  It will look just like new, but it's 20% of the value.
John Mayer has been alerted to your location.
Why would this gmt be worth that much? That’s crazy
I had a headache, just trying to think about how to take it apart, let alone put it back together! Holy Shit.
Stunning piece, and stunning work.  Thanks for "watching" and adding to the story of this heirloom.
Radium is a nasty stuff. It may emit alpha and gamma particles which are the most dangerous. Alpha may be stopped  by material but gamma is more troublesome as it will go through most materials easily, except Lead.  Be careful with these!
Thank you Marshall for taking your viewers on this amazing vintage watch restoration.  I always watch your content from start to finish without interruption because of your ability to make me feel like I’m right there with you. I love your authentic enthusiasm around your craft.
With your fine motor skills, total focus, and eye for minute details you could have probably filled the roll of a brain surgeon🧐?
through this whole year, everytime i watched you i became more interested in working on watches. i think next year i'll bite the bullet and give it a shot
Hi Can i know where i can find you ? I had a rolex but its a duplicate i wore that watch since 2013 & that watch has survived even though the sea water for past 10 past years as it is water resistant but unfortunately recently i replaced its battery (cell) and the guy who replaced it forgot to tighten the back cover & it was flooded with the water which having a shower, as i told you i never took it off my wrist until it needs battery replacement . So due to that flooding it totally stopped working but i believe it can still be recovered if it gets in the hand of an expert like you. Thanks Looking forward to hear from you.
Great video as usual , but I'm sorry I just don't understand why that watch is worth that insane amount of money, you can get a fully working serviced gorgeous 1959 Zodiac aerospace gmt, with a near identical movement, excellent swiss build quality and longer history for 2 to 3 grand. I just don't and think I never will understand the hype around Rolex
Bro is giving me tears 😭 😂
I wish I'd found your website before buying all the items for my kit. You are correct that buying all the niche items is intimidating.
Wow what a beauty!  Grandpa would be proud!
Beauty
Incredible.
Is not a big diference after and before. Time and monkey wasted.
I have a rare,1930's Mido watch. Are you interested???
I wouldn’t pay more than 75 bucks for that ugly watch.
Rolex is OVER please !!!!!!!
Two thumbs up to this guy..very cool handed
I think the best watch ive ever seen is the Bugatti watch with a fully working w16 engine in the middle Ty for the great vids mate
Hello. I Live in Scotland, would you be so kind to fix my 22 year old Seiko watch please? Its kinetic and winds with the movement of the wrist. it has served me well. I think the moving part that winds it up has come away from its mounting. The battery generator has been replaced 2 times and probably needs so again. If I sent it to you please could you fix it for me. I can send it by post. The watch is very expensive and I see that you are a perfectionist which I admire. Regards from Scotland. (please let me know if you can fix my watch I can send model details and photos) THANKS
You should probably use the blue Loctite. The red is much stiffer after setting.
That'd probably justify why Neil Armstrong became an astronaut.
A very special watch of a lifetime, you worked and restored it ro the fullest condition. Very well done, Bravo !! Thanks so much for sharing.
This was such a great vid to watch. Lots of respect for working on this, considering its value, it must've been a mix being being thrilled and feeling a bit of trepidation.
best watch ever.
Beautifully done ! Really appreciate how much skill and knowledge this requires
Im gonna react to this video so people can *watch* a *watch* guy *watch* a *watch* guy restoring a *watch* .
Do you repair Movados ? I lost part of the band and would like to keep it original.
How does someone go about sending you a watch? Thanks!
I know nothing about watches always amazed  by mechanical marvels And this was a an amazing marvel to watch 😂
so did you at least put it on and take a couple selfies? great vid, amazing watch, that a boy.
Like everyone else I am fascinated watching you repair these watches.  Your videos are wonderful.  Do you also repair pocket watches?
Most excellent!
Saw a news article about this.  Very awesome job!
Have you ever considered making your own watch based on all the best components you've liked from different watches and functions you would like ? Or is it not that straightforward?
garbage
Greetings Marshall.  I have a special piece you may be interested in.  Is there a pathway to contacting you?  Thank you.
I saw the seconds hand start moving around right before the hands were removed and i was overjoyed
I felt like I was right there with you, on pins and needles, hoping that Bakelite bezel didn't crack! Nice job.
you have me interested in watches now. what a interesting video and a cool watch repaired
7 microseiverts per hour!
I am inpressed by your great work on the Rolex........
Good job!
incredible
Is there any reason that you  didn’t  remove the tube , for inspection an ultrasonic cleaning , separately from the case ?   In a watch so old and dirty .
Wonderful insight. Thankyou.
Its videos like this that help me realize how stupid I am in comparison to some really great minds that have the ability to dream and fabricate such mesmerizing things.
Amazing 🇬🇧
Marshall, I love to see what watch you’re wearing when you do your work. Looks like a Rolex 1675 with a gorgeous fuchsia bezel insert. 😚👌 Nice!
The result was amazing
Just love your videos. I have an old watch from the fifties that I may send to you for repair. You do great work and it's so relaxing to watch. Enjoy it all the time. Lol
Great job!! Personally, and this is just me..I would have asked you to keep original crystal with a polish! Loved the way it was cracked!
Watch making should be complusory in medical school
My dude. 6.8microSV is no joke. That is like a general area dose rate in the controlled zone of Nuclear Power Station.
I have a Rolex that my grandfather purchased in Vietnam that I need restored I’ve tried twice to have it fixed but both times the watch stopped ticking could you maybe help me out the watch means a lot to me
This video have me so much satisfaction, what an incredible job you did sir, just amazed at the care and precision.
I knew it was radium!
You are truly a master artist at your craft
This was so much fun to watch. See what I did there? 😂… I subscribed. Beautiful work. I think I’m going to love all your videos. ❤
I have a Gruen Curvex watch (I think dating to the 1940s) that belonged to my father which still runs but I would bet has never been serviced. Would the servicing of this watch make a good video for your channel?
Waaaaaay too many camera changes and edits!!!  Your old videos were so much more focused!!!  More isn’t always better!!!
Nice work!!
wow.  watched the videos then saw the price....  nice work.  thanks
I've heard that there was a lawsuit in regards to this watch. Something about the bakelike being radioactive and some person manageg to win a suit regarding it.
I wonder what a GMT would have retailed for in 1958?  Many (or some) of these grand watches were used for Navigation Air and Sea, the secondary hour hand could be left on "Greenwitch Time"   which is key for Celestial Navigation, hence the name of this model GMT Greenwich Mean Time.  Thanks for sharing.
Ahhhh mate awesome 😎 greetings from Australia love your channel, new sub for life 🧬❤️
Makes me wonder if bakelite could be put into a "retrobrite" restoration, hydrogen peroxide and UV light to get it clear again
What an absolutely gorgeous piece.  I may have missed it but do we know a date of manufacture for this one?
Oh man don’t tell me he’s going to contaminate his sonic cleaner
I think it was lost for decades then found by someone it just looks truly weathered by the elements not so much worn,  ..beach, mountains, desert ?    PS. I have a feeling that bezel is going to crack when he hits his hand on an object, no way your going to avoid that unless of course you put in a case 7 look at for a lifetime, I would want to wear it, life is too short.
How do you oil the tips of the pallet fork?
Whats was the Pulp Fiction watch in the movie where the story goes his dad had it up ass while in prison during war?
Very impressive 1.6M views in 7 days. I was unaware watch repair was this big a category. Question: What would happen if you put an entire unassembled movement into the cleaner? I presume it would be impossible to reach all the nooks and crannies. Would there be a possibility of damage due to the mass? Probably not, I guess, if it is safe to clean a jumble of loose parts.
Hermoso video. Saludos desde Port Saint Lucie Florida.
at 9:00 the movement started working before it was even disassembled. Incredible something that old and worn started to run again before any restoration.
It looks amazing...
..i am truly impressed by your patience during this fiddly de-construction of this nice watch... as well by your professional comments and contextual explanations: great work!👍👍👍
I enjoyed watching this
you deserve a trophy, I hope every watch repairs have that passion and affection to what theyre doing.
What's up everybody! Welcome to another episode of Limited Resources! I'm your host, Marshall! Here with me today is Luis...
I have a 40 year old Seadweller that I wanted to replace the bezel.  Fortunately a Rolex service guy told me to just leave the old one on it.  He said since it didn’t look too bad, replacing it would make it lose a good bit of the value.
how did they even make screws that small?
well i'm pretty sure i could get it apart.... never back together :)  beautiful watch, awesome work!
Like everyone else, I would love to have that watch
You lost me when you scratched the main plate with the screwdriver when you decided to use it as a pry bar
Am I the only one absolutely DYING wanting to know how someone reacted when they got the watch back or wanting to know how much a watch was sold for.
Love the narration !
this video upsets me....a lot i might add. why did it take me so long to find this kind of entertainment lol I watched the entire video while I contemplated tearing down one of my watches lol loved your content!!!!
love watching a true master at work
I wouldnt have paid $5 dollars for that thing prior to watching this video.
The owner is such a lucky fella. I hope he cherishes it.
Great video!  I bought a GMT Master II "Coke" in 1999.  I had just entered my career and I knew I wanted a Rolex Submariner.  I strolled into my closest Jeweler that carried Rolex and looked for that submariner with the "cyclops."  When I saw the GMT Master II with the oyster case and bracelet, but with the red black bezel I had to try it on.  It fit perfectly on my larger than average wrist.  It came home with me after a $3,320 charge to my credit card.  I wore that watch all the time!  It was my daily for more than 10 years.  However, I would not wear it to the beach, or in the ocean.  I worked as a lifeguard on the beach / ocean front for dozens of summers, but I could not subject my GMT to the rigors of moving and using equipment e.g. boats, jet skis, paddle boards, ect. that was all apart of the job when not sitting in the sun.  When the red on the bezel faded I did not like that.  I had it serviced by Rolex and it came back looking like new.  I loved that.  Fast forward to five years ago when I realized that I "ruined" the patina, and the bevel edges were touched up.  The bezel was replaced, but thankfully the "swiss only" dial remained and so did the hands.  And I am completely happy with it.  In my opinion I "ruined" nothing.  I stopped the daily wear for a long time because I thought for me, it was too valuable to wear.  But I have revised this thinking, and it is now more often on my wrist than not, but just not at the beach.  I love and cherish it as I did that first day I took it home.  Cheers!
Very impressive, nerves of steel.
I've been watching the shorter clips on IG, or maybe TikTok, so I'm glad the full video popped up here in my suggested videos!
My hat is off to you sir. You are a true craftsman. You work on things so small I can't hardly see them. Your video was so exciting to watch pardon the pun. I thought I had a good memory for the order of things but watching you was mind blowing again pardon the pun.  AWESOME.
$100,000 🤣🤣🤣 Walmart sells these. They're as rare as a kardashian scandal.
I have a watch I need help with please
Cracked bezel probably because of the radiation
Fkn Cool 🔥
I have rare omega that kinda works that omega will not touch. It’s been to Europe and back. I have tried to reach out before to see if you would like to help. Any help would be greatly appreciated. It’s my grandfathers I would have to look but it’s from 1950. Thank you
100k for a watch is obscene!!
Just impressed with your talent....Wow .
How much do you charge for fixing something like that?
now give him a dollar store watch
Stunning!
From a horological history standpoint this is an incredible watch. I believe this should be valued above the one listed on Wind Vintage due to the fact that that one has a bezel that is extremely cracked. Which is to be expected from a watch of that age. The fact that this one's bezel has virtually no cracks in it  is absolutely incredible.
Throughly enjoyed your video. Impressive craftsmanship
Excelente
Loved that watch and its restoration. The video production and storytelling are stunning!
Если хочешь быть отцом, оберни яйцо свинцом!!!☢
Fleamarket find ?
What a treat this video is. Thank you for sharing!
im wondering if it was put in the drawer because of the broken band and sitting for so long make he dirt harden and lock the crown in place
Could it be the exposure to radium that caused that unusual damage to the crystal?
Woman died to paint this rolex
What a beautiful vintage piece
Excellent! Bravo!
Very calming watching this.
I was looking videos for micro soldering, you are insane!
I just want you to know you are the best of the best. When it comes to tiny, working with the watch is of high value and quality. Keep up the good work. We need more people like you. But you're one of a kind.
Hello Marshall! First of all big applause for your work and greetings from Munich! Always a pleasure to watch.  One question: I noticed that in this video you used a different braking grease than the Kluber P125. May I ask which one you used here (Moebius?) and why? Thank you!
mainly here for the voice  but also loving the watches 😅
I'd like to see a Spring Drive service please.
Bakelite just use a little soap and water and a soft brush,   cleans it up real nice.
I was wondering if you could suggest a source for the small screws often needed in watch repair. I got into collecting vintage Russian watches (just before the Ukraine war broke out) and I've had to repair (or have attempted to repair) a few of them. I learned some hard lessons - one being that those tiny screws can jump out of your tweezers. They are gone forever if your workspace is not set up to catch them. Thanks for another great video!
Hello wrist cancer!
great restoration ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I have no clue why I watch these... But for some reason I enioy doing so.  I guess for the same reason why shoes like "how it's made" were popular... Do I need to know how clogs are made? No... But it's probably kinda cool.
What the f***k? That watch is radioactive?
NICE. !! !! !! !!
Excellent work! Would love to see the customers reaction when you give it back to them.
This was fascinating. I would have never gotten that thing back together. 🤣
Why are you pretending to be speaking in real time, when it's clear you're not?
I don't know why this is so interesting but, its captured my full attention lol. Easiest sub I've found myself clicking.
Did the Rolex company have the same tight tolerances for the interior bits & bobs way back then or were the parts machined by hand? And where did you get those nifty little latex finger gloves? Never seen anything like that before.
Amazing to see all those parts so gently removed and then to see the final result on re-assembly. Definitely no shaky hands there! There wasn't any hesitiation to remove/replace the dozens of parts. Is a photographic memory required? ☺ Well done. A pleasure to "watch".  One other point.....I'd never seen the inside of a Rolex, so this was a total eye opener. Making those parts for such precision fitting had to be very time consuming.  So - how long would  it take to make the parts for just one of those watches?
If you close your eyes, you hear Seth Rogan 😂. What a beautiful piece
If the dial was refinished, why would it still be so radioactive?  Or are the hands just radioactive?
Since watching your videos I’ve really wanted to try it for myself! I was looking for tools but I can only find really cheap ones on Amazon or really expensive ones from watchmakers.  Hopefully you ship to the uk and hopefully this will be a good midrange set! :)
Greatly respect your work. Is there some forum or messaging system I could email you about a watch matter?
Wow, that’s amazing. 👍🏻
$100,000 for something that contains a banned radioactive material ?
What a great video :-)  I thought I'd give it a try but I usually watch your LR stuff.  Well worth watching.  I know it's a 52 minute video, but how long (excluding waiting for parts etc) did it take you to complete the renovation?
You make it look so easy mate. Not really surprise that you've got so many Patrons. Watching & listening is very therapeutic, it calms the soul.  Seriously mate, how do you keep your hands & fingers so steady.? We've always enjoy watching your show and its becoming a family viewing. Thank you for taking us through a wonderful journey from the past. We are privilege. Cheers from Australia.
I always wanted to be a horologist.  Amazing work!
Man you were featured on Supercar Blondie Blog. Saw on my phone news lol. That's cool man and you deserve it for sure.
Hey Wrist Watch Revival, is there a reason you wouldnt buff the scratches from the internal metals? (I'm a newbie) Kind regards. Edit: I did see that you wouldn't finish the outside because of its beautiful patina. I think that may have answered my question. Beautiful and detailed work, the narration is great.
I remember a story about that radio active stuff they used to make the hands and everything else glow in that watch, two ladies who worked with that stuff were told it was perfectly safe, not to worry about it. So they proceeded to take some home and put it on as make. Everywhere they put makeup on their faces and lips they put that radio active stuff, turned off the lights and had some fun with glowing faces, eyelids and lips. Well it ended up killing the two ladies. How sad.. they were lied to. I think I saw that on 100 ways to die. A t.v show back in the nineties.
I want to know how someone came up with this design and how they made these peices back then. This is absolutely amazing work.
Watching these videos have made me lust after automatic watches. I wanted my Dad’s Seiko when he died but didn’t get it so I finally bought my own Seiko a King Samurai Automatic and I love it.
How do you keep track of the locations of each screw? They all look very similar
Why did you not clean the face or hands?
Decades ago, in 1959 I purchasesed a Rolex chronometer from the Rolex distributer in Hong Kong, it cost me nearly $100.00 USD which was about two months pay for this young Marine Private First Class!  Wore it for years until my father talked me out of it and then I purchased a replacement from the same distributer in Hong Kong, but it was never as accurate timepiece!
Amazing job ! Well done !
Isn't there a way to "remove" that yellowish tone from the resin and make it clear and polished again?
where did u buy the dial box and the hand box ps. love your videos
Incredible, well narrated without any unnecessary waffle, just pure detail about each step. One question..why not use the ultrasonic instead of the spinney thing on those wheels?
всё же это ремонт, реставрация предполагает  удаление царапин, полировку, чистку корпуса и браслета.
Super vidéo de la montre vintage
So many people have died from radiation exposure, mostly women, after years of manually inserting radium into clocks of this kind.
you could actually edit these videos a bit less. it d be cool to see some of the parts you cut for brevity, like the short cuts where u flip things over and such. it would feel mor elike sitting in a shop at the flea market watching someone work on jewlery
Fascinating 😊
Would he go through all this mumbo jumbo for my citizen watch?
amazing to see all the small parts inside the watch!  The disassembling and reassembling also amazing!
That exact same model watch from the mid-fifties was stolen from my house in Portland, OR in 2016. Is there any way to track it? It has my father's name (and probably his New York address) inscribed inside.
Can someone please tell me how a watch can be possibly be worth $100,000?
Is that watch cleaning machine superior to an ultrasonic cleaner?
The 6542 is my favorite Rolex ever ! Love that bakelite lumed bezel ! Thanks for this captivating video!
Wonderful restoration. Sadly a year ago I was robbed of my Rolex which was gifted to me by my wife on my 60th birthday and 23rd anniversary celebration. Thankfully no one was hurt and it was insured and after jumping through the hoops of fire and thorns the insurance co presented, I was able to settle my claim. Unfortunately, with the Rolex supply situation as it is, I was not able to replace my Rolex with a new one but, I did find a nice 1995 Model which will do for the time being. My wife, bless her, really wants me to get a new one so, while I wait and wait and wait, I at least have this nice SS Date Just 1995 on my wrist.
I don't see much difference between before and after.
Watching you clean and repair and oil watches is very soothing.
Bakelite is a plastic.
Respect man, this gives me an appreciation for watch engineering.
Wow amazing work! Beautiful watch.
Why not use an ultrasonic cleaner ? That and solvents i feel would make the watches spotless even the gunk thats impossible to clean
❤
I've seen butane torch lighters plastic tank crackle like that (and then explode) in the presence of isopropyl alcohol. I wonder if that crystal was made of the same plastic.
Maybe as part of your new website you might find places that have rare spare parts?
nice :)
Hey friend, great video, love the details. I am a CNC machinist, and for a time, I was working for a Medical Device manufacturer. Our largest parts were tiny, about the size of the smallest screws you handle here in this video-and were largely platinum. Anyway, cleaning the parts in the baskets with (I assume) an ultrasonic degreaser-be careful putting them together like that. I erroneously left 100 parts in a basket down in the cleaning zone for 60 seconds too long one time and the entire batch had to be scrapped due to scratches. Not sure that things are so critical in watch making (scratches were only viewable through a microscope) but figured I'd still throw that out there.
I'll keep my Casio G Shock , thank you ...
What a awesome old watch. Id be curious to know its actual value even with the refinished dial i bet it crazy!
1st time ever seeing a watch of any kind worked on. I found this absolutely fascinating.  How in the hell do you remember where everything goes?? This was just flat out neat to watch (no pun intended). Thank you for sharing this video. Strictly out of curiosity,  what would a restoration like this cost? If you can't or don't want to answer, I understand.
Amazing skill & restoration. Looks like heart surgery but on a watch. Gives you an appreciation of how complex these timepieces are. Great job!
This is soooo satisfying...
Imagine that. A watch found in a drawer.
i don't even own a watch but man do I love these videos for some reason.  Great work!!
If you wore that watch for 12 hours a day for a year you would be exposed to ~30 mSv/yr of radiation. That is too much.
You could have been a pilot with the precision of a Neurosurgeon..  instead you make cool watch vids.  Either way, pretty D awesome.
That was really cool 🆒, my stepdad was a watch repeat man or jeweler I should say, he repaired Rolexs  , your video brought back some great memories for me , thank you!!!
Ha! In my grandpa's drawer was a Seiko 6138-7000. Similarly rough shape, and I value it as if it were a Rolex, because it was my grandpa's.
Man talk about feeling enlightened and useless within the same 52 mins....I cant even build an Ikea wardrobe without shit left over lol............absolute god tier skills. 100% respect
I hope he wears it daily and gives it even more character.  I'm jealous.
RESPECT to you my friend. I could NEVER do such art..... All those tiny parts.. Then remembering the sequence they go back.. UGH lol.. But I sure love watching YOU do it.
Time sun moisture takes a toll on crystals
Do you know why 6542 circa 1958 come in both RED or BLACK date dials?
1.4 million views in 6 days. Everyone loves to watch
So cool to watch. The corrosion in the part is probably sweat build up. Mainly salt
Nicest watch I've seen you do so far. That bakelite is cool. No chance of me ever affording a Rolex...
My name is Marshall to bruv
Beautiful watch, and it's nice to see you've refined your technique so as not to leave scratches on the metal when removing the jewels.   Nice work.
I really wish Rolex made a watch like this again that was more affordable, so that we could wear it all the time. These watches are meant to be worn, they're meant to be enjoyed. I absolutely love seeing the ones that are beat up and aged as they've done their purpose in life. Yes they may be worth thousands now, but to someone, it was a utility that they needed and relied upon. It was priceless to them.
Thanks for allowing me to come along on your repair journey. A great video.
Website was a smart venture. Love the selection of pre-owned, and running auctions is even cooler. Hope it exceeds! Well done.
Sometimes i wonder where these Watches got their extreme wear and overall bad scratched condition. Someone told me that they from gravediggers and were in the mud under earth for decades. Creepy thought if that was the truth
the new cristal makes the restoration shockingly beautiful. amazing work.
You need to wear a dosimeter as well with this watch.
Fantastic work as always. Was that crystal, sapphire?
I bet you charged 10k dollar for that restoration ^^
Perfect. Totally absorbing
Tiny 65 year old pieces of metal that still work so well together.  Incredible.
This is my first video from you. I must say I enjoyed your presentation and work very much. As a lifelong mechanic and computer component repair tech, I totally agree with not refinishing the case. The Bezel and case came out beautifully and make it a fine vintage piece. You're a great craftsman and artist, thanks for sharing!
As you're aligning the hands to take them out you can see the Second hand just going, it was so ready to work again.
This watch has me literally drooling! It is amazingly beautiful and I'm with you I love the fact that the original owner wore it like I would a Timex 😅 beautiful watch and I hope who has it is wearing it as their daily!
Hard to believe you haven't been doing this all your life.
I would replace the mechanism to a new watch and leave everything as is for posterity
That crystal looks like it was damaged by a chemical.  I don't know what it is made of, but it looks like acrylic that was soaked with automotive brake parts cleaner.
"Only a minor amount of decomp from the body they stole this off"
EXCELENTE SERVIÇO 👍👍  🇧🇷
very nice to see this watch kept as it was... i too would love to know the history of it!.. i kinda envision a business man that wore it everyday until the day he passed away long after he retired. you did an excellent job taking care of this beautiful dinosaur !... ive spent my entire lunch hour at work watching this ( while i ate of course😂)
how does the watch know wether or not its a 30 day month or 31 day month, or do you just have to set it when the month starts.
I wonder if the crystal cracking was due to radiation embrittlement. Happens to certain types of glass under long-term or hard radiation environment.
I have a question about my Rotary automatic watch.   Everything on it seems to work properly except the hour hand gets out of time with my everyday motion.   It's almost as if it's loose but all the rest keeps perfect(seconds/minutes).    Is this something you can help me with?    I'm being told by jewlers that no one will work on the movement. Instead, they will just replace the whole thing if something is bad....HELP!
Unreal Marshal!! Beautiful to watch as usual 🫠🫣
Fake.
if the dial is repainted then it's clearly not 100K. Maybe 30 or 20, no more but I get the clickbait title. Nice work though.
The crystal is age-cracked, due to degradation of the material. It probably can’t be used, though I would keep it with the watch…
This was in my recommendations today, never seen any of these videos before. Very interesting and fun to... watch! 😄 Question about those finger thingies. Why not wear them on all fingers?
No oil on the ruby bearings
everything is gorgeous your professional I love your job❤. but I think that watch might look immensely unique if you didn't change the old crystal because it  tells all the history of that watch and she served will moreover it maks it a unique looking one like a survivor that didn't betray its owner until this day..
That passion in your voice grew to a fabulous crescendo at the end. A pleasure to see and hear you giving some much needed TLC for the watch and family.
I had a heart attack at 08:25 when the screwdriver slipped 🤣
You are so lucky to work on something so rare man. Im not a watch guy and this is the first video i watched but my god what you did to that thing is gorgeous good job.
Great work and amazing video. Very inspiring... travels me almost 35 years when i used to dismantle every clock at my parents home. Thank you for sharing your work and passion
Well done. I’ve never watched someone work on a watch before and you have truly inspired me. I’m genuinely impressed by the craft and feel that it might become my next interest 😅. Luckily I know where to go for kits ❤.   Thank you 🙏.
The cracks on the crystal looks like UV damage on plastic, or thermal damage. The complex swirls especially, looks like it might be following (previously) invisible defects.   I wonder what caused it?
Customer: what do you mean $1,000  Store: Watch This🤳
Just sat and watched (heh) this whole video. It was fascinating and amazing; the skills and knowledge required to do this, not to mention the tools, are remarkable.
I’ve gotten into buying old cheap watches on eBay and seeing if I can get it working again. It does take a lot of practice but I’m really enjoying learning how to get them running again. I’m having a hard time keeping all the parts straight and knowing where they go again or keeping them organized so I know where they go again. Does anyone have any advice on how to keep them all organized? Any help would be great. Thank you!
I would love to learn more about the manufacturing of these small components. Pre-CNC. Truly incredible craftsmanship from you and the original creators.
I hate to be that guy but is it a commonly accepted practice to pry off pieces with a metal screwdriver? I watched it over and over until 18:34 where a piece was pryed off and with the first attempt to do so gouged a nice line in the polished portion of the movement. I understand this isn't a professional Rolex service but especially with the value of the watch wouldn't it be better try pry these parts with a wood dowel with a chisel shape?
Outstanding - your best video yet!
Spectacular!
Wouldnt pay more than 50 for this ugly thing 🤣🤣🤣
Holy cow!! Congrats!! 1.3 million views within 6 days of posting!!
Great job!!! You have the patience of a saint ...
Flitz polishes bakelite no problem like new
Looking at all them parts on the table. I've just developed anxiety.  That watch would never be the same again if I attempted this.  Craking job. Had me hooked from start to finish.
bake-light! ..
Your knowledge and skill is worth a hundred of these watches easily.  Beautiful work
I've always wanted to know. I hope you will answer please. Are those cap wheel jewels and the other jewels actual ruby or some other precious stones? Are the heels used in Rolex Breitling and other top shelf watches actual mined precious stones or synthetic jewels?
Is 240 amplitude really that good on this old of a watch?
I have watched many if your uploads and never ceases to amaze me as to how you put this thing back together.
What incredible intricate machinery!
Is the crystal crazing a result of the ionizing radiation induced embrittlement?
Rotaco?
Beautiful resurrection… and exactly the kind of restoration could deserve that watch, no point to leave the original glass and try to refurbish it and then break it… better keep it somewhere like a testimony…. And neither an outrageous restoration to try to make it newer than back in the days… just retrieve its original beauty… it’s just a watch after all…..
Amazing. ❤
Holy shit this video was an hour. I'm supposed to be revising...
The result on the timegrapher has a lot of ‘noise’ …
Is the owner keeping or selling it?
Maybe the watch is what killed the man.
I wonder if the watch is for sale? I'm interested in buying it Great video btw
Id love to see reaction of the owner
Absolutely stunning video and documentation on the restoration of this old warrior.  Out of curiosity, why not use your ultrasonic cleaner on the internal components instead of the oscillating liquid bath?  Best content video I've seen this year.
What does GMT STAND FOR AND MEAN?
Just wow .. fantastic video .. thank you so much for all your input and descriptions .. unbelievable it is .
Not to this watch, but i think vacuum pump can help uv resin to fill that cracks, after you can wash it and do some uv light to make resin harden.  But i know that cracks are physically growing in any structures, and thats why it is just a suggestion. And i think this kind of repair doesnt lie in restoration phylosophy) Stopped breathing each time, when that "flying thing" appears. It is very interesting to watch your videos thank you!
In this sort of case, you really do add value to this watch. Congrats and great video.
I I were Rolex I would hire you and then wealthy customers could order on top of their normal watch service a little movie made by you. That would be instagramable...
Very cool! One of my favorites!
Algorithm put me here and after some minutes I thought „you know that voice“ … endless pro tour and Grand Prix coverage burned your voice in my brain …. Spooky
i never knew i was interested in watch making/repair.
I just bought a fake one of these off aliexpress that says oris instead of rolex but same design n mines probably radioactive to😂
Vintage amazing Rolex!
Really cool video! But, I couldn’t help but think about why some people assign so much value to something like a wristwatch. To me, it isn’t worth more than $100. Regardless, the skill set, steady hands, and effort you put in is absolutely superb.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Perfection and a master class at work. Beautifully restored.
H E L P ! !
My dad told me about a visit he made to a watch factory when he was a kid. A row of seated ladies would apply the radium paint with a little paintbrush. They would lick the brush to form a tight point at the end of the brush. Anyone want that job? Yikes!!!
Where R my COMMENTS??
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP
Mixed feelings about this. The watch is no longer original. Having said that, great job.
outstanding, thank you
Such a pleasure to watch a master at work... unfortunately hard to enjoy with the amount of adverts😢
Fantastic work Marshall!
Awesome video! Really enjoyed this one.
hello sir, love to watch you work, how come you didn’t oil little wheel (gears) shafts 23:35 before putting them back in? aren’t wheel shafts friction points? 🤔
I thought ot was tritium the radioactive material used, i had a 1016 with tritium
Really great watch. Well done.
This makes me nervous just watching your expert hands! Wow.
This is amazing to see. This is the most iconic watch ever and watching you restore it was a bit nerve wrecking
Wow, very good job
My dad offered me this exact watch in working condition 6 months before he died. I said, no thanks dad I dont wear watches. It was his fathers watch handed down to him and I had no idea of its monetary value. Oh well thats life.
This is amazing! It's just so annoying that people who actually want to buy such watches need to fork over so much money because the retailers prioritize people who in the end flip these watches for 40-100% markup (which inturn fuels those flippers to continue spending with retailers who end up prioritizing them, etc etc...) People whonjust want to wear them end up jumping through hoops and even then can't find a watch at a decent retail price....
I love your videos and expertise
Different patina on the strap , better with the original.
So... why is it worth $100K?? Yeah it's an old Rolex but like he said, it's one of Rolex's most common models. Bakelite being trash directly results in this vintage of watch's rarity but it's a very familiar-looking watch. The radioactivity of it is actually pretty awesome though. 😁
This type of cracking pattern on the crystal is typical for UV exposure. That man had worn the watch a lot in the sun.
It must a geniuses that not only built these watches but the tooling and finite machinery ,,per say ,,that  led these watches to be built,Imagine the skills that these craft-men.  women and the patience to manufacture the precision parts ,❤
Could the crazing of the crystal be due to decades of gamma radiation from the radium dial?
you know, I'm not rich, but I at least take pride in that I'm not stupid enough to buy this even if I was
Hey, I went into the website and clicked on the entry level kit. But it said page not found does it work on mobile? thank you, love your videos❤
Nice playmat. Are you a magic player as well?
I hope and I’m sure you did get paid handsomely for this project.
Commenting on this to make sure YouTube recommends more videos like this. Absolutely love your skill and passion!
Its about 1am in the morning and here i am laying in bed watching this! Idk why but i am
Why the finger condoms? You never touch watch!
That came up stunning! Was getting nervous when the bezel was getting worked on! 💖
That is amazing great job all those springs and screws would stress me out lol. 👏
Thanks for the video I’m impressed. I have a 1957 bulova that belonged to my father I would love to have this done to.
Beauty piece. I wonder what the odds of finding a watch like this is? I would be shaking if i spotted one sitting somewhere just waiting for someone to find it
Dude... RUN!
Great Job  on this Vintage Rolex! Congrats.
The case and bezel could’ve used a very fine polishing. Keep the wear and scratches and nicks, but those close ups of the swirls looked bad
Ahhhh…. So sleepy now.😊
Great presentation. Why didn't you try to restore the case? Not a full restoration, but I think a slight polish of the case was warranted. Am I wrong?
I restore vintage Porsches and this makes me want to restore vintage watches now. I'm going to purchase your kit!
Great video,  have you ever done a watch strip down on a really simple mechanical watch for a newbie
so why didn't you soak it in a solvent before you trie to remove the bezel?
Just found your channel and I never knew there was so many parts in a watch…it’s so fascinating watching you rebuild this amazing watch! Great video! Subscribed
What a beautiful watch restored t like new!,,,amazing.
Tears of joy for how well that came out!
Incredible. The attention to detail from Maker and Master blew my hair back‼️ By far one of the coolest things I have ever seen on YouTube. Thank you sir for sharing your gift with us.
This is a perfect example of why I don't watch "TV" anymore.
My cat would absolutely jump up on the table with all those delicate pieces laying around
Just made it worthless
Fascinating
No idea how I ended up here but I watched the whole thing so...... thanks
PHENOMENAL ❗ I LOVE 💘 IT!
Why is the second hand ticking, I thought a Rolex watch did not do any ticking it's supposed to be smooth,  right 🤔🤔 ?
I forgot where everything goes 😂
Nice job, I love the look of a worn watch with a mint crystal
What a  beautiful machine... how do you remember how to reassemble it? That chubby guy Rico won’t have anything nice to say about this
Holy crap 💩!!!!!
Mu grandfather had this same watch.  Had the same one exactly though not sure if it was the 58 or later version but 4 sure it was one of the earlier ones. He was a cardiologist and practicing medicine in the 1950's.
You should implement an "Notify Me" feature for items that are out of stock. I'd buy a seagull or three if you had this.
Watching this video makes me calm down and relaxing!  Thank you.
isn't this one of those glow in the dark watches? those with radioactive material in it? i'm sorry, i didn't watch the entire video, it's late and i'm sick rn
So right about the different ticks between makes. I buy cheap vintage watches since I have a small wrist, but my Seikos have a fast delicate tick that's almost musical, where as my soviet Poljat ticks like a hammer, you can hear it in a quiet room.
I have a 1958 Rolex GMT with a unique bracelet/band. The band has springs inside each section so that the band will expand and retract automatically when being worn, it is super comfortable. This watch was purchased on Wake Island at the PX in 1958. I have never seen this Rolex type of watch band on any other Rolex. Please comment.
Really annoying to get video interrupted by commercials. Still worth watching.
It just keep going!!!! So many parts.
The mainspring isn't a power source. It's a kinetic battery. 😅
at 16:06 I thought you gouged the piece with your screwdriver but after rewatching it, it seems it had already been gouged before you touched it. Interesting to see manufacturing mistakes from 1958 edit: you definitely scratched the hell out of it at 18:32 though
I just about had a heart attack when he put that bezel in water!! No no no no no. Don't ever do that with exposed lume and old blue and red paint. No!
You are the Bob Ross of the watch world!!! This is a very positive compliment! It's a "WE" type of environment and makes us feel like we are part of your adventure when you dig into new challenges... great job!
Absolutely, that drawer find was very much like a “barn find”! Although confident the bezel was removed and replaced successfully, that was tense and obviously could have ended tragically. Also tense was the unveiling of the movement’s condition. So happy for the owner. Great video!
Grandpa will be happy
This is top YouTube. Thanks for letting us into your shop.
I had heard all Rolexes had a sweeping second hand but I notice this one tics. Is that because it’s an older model?  I heard that because I bought a couple fake Rolexes overseas a long time ago and that’s the first thing someone noticed. Also the rash the band gave me was probably a good tell. 😂
One cool attribute to Bakelite is it could explode on impact. Look up Bakelite Billiard Balls
Hands like a surgeon……yeah ill stick to building cars!!!…..to much heavy drugs in my younger years , aint no way my hand are steady enough to handle a delicate $100k watch….no way jose!!…….very satisfying video watching you do your magic though….bravo sir! Bravo!
Now, we'll oil up the jewels. I'm a toddler
Wow. That turned out amazing.
Hi Marshall, big fan! Just curious as the audio recording is so crisp...do you narrate these as you go or do you do it afterwards? Thanks!
I like seeing its little engine start up. Like it is saying "I'm still alive"...
That crystal wasn't shattered. Just crazing from decades of time. It happens to a lot of plastic crystals.
Victorian egg timer?
I knew I Geiger would Jump when I saw the age and the illumination. LOL
Imagine finding this in Gramps underwear drawer. Just incredible stuff.
It is interesting. coming from luthiery world and restorations, that new watch parts on vintage watch restorations are not aged to look harmonious with the rest of the watch's patina. Is there a reason for this?
Awesome. Can you straighten the dial? Looks a tad crooked.
Inspiring and educational.  Thank you very much. Before my retirement, my most delicate work was procedures through a loop on premie babies.  I watch your videos to relax.  :)
Why is the case yellowed (seen during initial reassembly)? Is that staining from original lubricant? It would not seem that there would be lubricant along the perimeter of the movement case.
i can replace car engines and clutches , but i will probably get lost putting this clock back together with extra parts at the end
do you do old pocket watches. like early 1800's era?
Beautiful work, you created a piece of art and beauty. Thanks for sharing
The irony here is your cleaning the old owner out of the watch.
As soon as I saw the luminous font and heard it was from the 50s I knew immediately what that meant haha
Its a beauty one.
Brilliant workmanship!!
I love watching your videos but for this watch I wouldnt replace a single thing. Even the crystal. Just clean, maintain and put them back
How do they manufacture the threads on the inside of the tiny crown stem barrel ….blows my mind.
Fascinating. Glad I stumbled across this channel. Very fragile process, restoring these watches. All those tiny components inside, simply fascinating thank you.
?????  Why not replace the radium with something safe  ?????  Does the radium still glow  ?????    Looks real good.
Great job!  Such cool videos and so satisfying to watch it all come together. It’s amazing that someone figured out how to make all those tiny little parts and put it together so it actually works and keeps accurate time for a very long period almost by itself. These videos never seem as long as they are. Thanks for what you do.
Great video. Those Rolex's look really crap.
Marshall this is one of your best my friend, WOW !!! Amazing work to keep it sooooooooo original.
18:31 omg DuuUUUuuude !
Too bad it's worthless
i Have a rolex day date stella dial 18038 oxblood that needs work. Pretty rare and expensive. Please let me know if you would like to do a video on it.
How much would you charge for a service like this on that value of watch? Great content, very interesting.
Very carthatartic tbh.😀 You must have photographic memory..
Nice job. Rare to see a bloke with so much experience working with such enthusiasm.
Which set of Dumont tweezers do you use for general assembly/disassembly?
Beautiful work!
👋WR
Marshal, how long does it take you to get these parts? IE gaskets, replacement parts?
Fantastic watch and excellent work! What a joy to watch!
So is there a theory why that crystal crazed like that? Could it be something to do with pressure- low ( in aircraft ) or high ( under water ) you might reasonably think it would pop off rather than do that
Ouch. Scratched the polish at 18:32. Not to mention the stripping of the screw at 8:24. Fun video to watch though.
I have mixed feelings about a $100,000 watch. Part of me is very interested in the intricacies and craftsmanship of this watch.  Another part of me is very put off that such a thing holds so much value. I scrolled over this video many times. Pausing. Not wanting to "give" my attention. Not wanting to feed the notion that such a thing deserves to be so valuable. And here I am. Like watching a celebrity give their opinion on anything important.
👍
I’m wondering is “gunky” a technical term?
Damn think I threw one of these away before... wow
Even if your videos are so so long, but they are so interresting to watch and the voice off, so natural, nice work man.
For a hobby it became a profession that can  be  a top.earner
I love the way you work and you are so entertaining, thank you best wished to you.🎉❤🎉🎉😂
Good job. Love the gmt also.❤
truly stunning
Hi, great video and one topic that I am asking myself how to do it right. It is radium on the watches, does you counter measure also alfa radiation or just beta and gamma?  Second question is do you wear any mask while working with such a watch or you are just not so close to it?  As I am new in this hobby I was thinking apart radium watch and I was scratching the dirt and looked in it from very close distance breathing it and few days after I watched yt video that told there can be radiation, and now I am so freighted to even touch this watch. Thank you for any advice regarding it.
That magnifier being a little too clockwise at the end had my ocd going crazy. ISn't there a better way to align the date magnifier than guessing?
This was a fun one to observe! Thanks!  While it won't compare to watch repair, many years ago I did subcontract work to repair office equipment of various kinds, and I was called to a university to help fix a "flatbed scanner" that had stopped working. I get there, expecting the usual desktop scanner, but instead they show me a custom-built large format scanner used by the university's Cartography Department, where they scan very large paper maps for digital storage. The scanner was all aluminum and about 6 feet long by 3 feet wide, and it was on a wheeled frame so they could easily move it around. I'd never worked on anything like it, but I eventually diagnosed that one of the motors that moves the imaging array had burned out, but while I had the thing pulled apart to remove the motor, I asked them what the scanner cost, and they said "$95,000", which took me more than a little off guard. lol  We obtained a replacement motor and I had it all put back together and working a few days later, although I was sweating just a little bit through the whole process.
Another excellent video! Thank you so much. Quick question. You said at the beginning of the bezel wouldn’t rotate around. After you cleaned it and such at the end, you don’t show rotating. Were you able to fix that part?
sounded like you was gonna get a hernia from removing the back case.. dont hurt yourself now
Fantastic work and what a beautiful watch .
That was spectacular!
Always love Marshalls work. I have at least my Great Grandfathers  pocket watch. It's got P & J Beringer pocket watch, Belfast, watchmakers / Jewellers. This belonged to Andrew who is said to have worked on the Titanic as a Joiner. I can't get anybody to look at it to repair. I'm told parts could not be had. Pity
holyshit, i have one of these from my grandpa. No idea they were worth so much!
Beautiful
your hands are blessed & I've admire the patience and skills you possessed, beautiful work as always
Hi, I recently got my hands on two Timex automatics (a 31 and a 32 movement)> I was wondering if you'd be interested in doing a service on one (looks almost NOS, rotor loose, runs fast) and some restoration as well as service on the other one (kept good time over several days, needs new crystal, straighten bent lug, clean up the case).
Loved the video. I'm curious about a couple of things. A couple of times you removed pieces from solvent or ultrasonic (which I assume is filled tith solvent), and then applied lubricant. Is there another step we're not seeing where you remove solvent before adding lubricant? Or do you just wait for the solvent to dry on its own? Many thanks!
The level of precision, expertise and engineering genius that it would require to design this watch is just staggering. Truly amazing.
You forgot to add a fresh coat of phosphorous to the dial, so that the radiation has something to illuminate.
you. did an awesome job.
Dang, it's a privilege just to be able to watch this GMT Master being serviced.   Couldn't imagine actually being able to service it or owning it lol
Talk about occupational hazards. Radiation, radon gas, highly-carcinogenic Bakelite (made from formaldehyde, asbestos, and toxic polymers). Inhaling the dust from that material, or even direct skin contact, can be deleterious. Simply “being careful” doesn’t cut it. The nostalgia of a classic Rolex is nice, but the best place for that thing is the drawer it came from.
You sound like a bomb disposal expert. With your calm voice and steady hands
so many parts just to tell time sheesh
That was beyond cool!
Can we send in a watch for you to repair?
U r the best
Threw a couple of these away last year. Wish I had seen this first.
Do you have any protection against yourself from the Radium lume? I think watches made before 1960s have Radium-226 lume which is highly dangerous
This is the first time I have came across your channel. I would like that I have been extremely impressed with your work. As a mechanic, I found it funny when you described the 3 levels of oil that you used, a fair bit different to what I have used. Thank you.
That crystal was too close to explosion. That kind of damage comes from high pressure blast wave. Bakelite didn't have room to flex so it remained intact, Crystal had air behind it so it flexed too much very fast.
As a machinist, i am just amazed that miniscule parts like these can even be made !!  The steady hand and patience it takes for this work is also, unreal. I can appreciate the cost of Rolex and similar high end watches now.  Nice work sir !
Marshall I just was quoted $475 and 6-8 weeks lead time to service an Eta movement in an Oris BC3.  This seems like a really long time and very expensive, can you just tell me if that is a crazy amount of time and money?  I just bought my first Swiss movement and the person I got it from said it was serviced in 2019.
Terrific video thanks!
I loved that video so much, it was like watching a master chef at work. The way they handled every element was so effortless and perfect, it was like they were dancing with the ingredients. And the final product was an absolute masterpiece, a symphony of flavors that left my taste buds singing. I'm so glad I watched that video, it was an experience I won't soon forget.
I thought you were going to re-lume the hands as they are radioactive. Thanks for the vid!!
Absolutely beautifully done sir.. I dream of having your hand stillness when I have worked on some of my time pieces . I must ask , the press you used for the hands , what make is that , it is phenomenal at pressure  alignment... My hat is off to you. Just watching the oiling of the various jewels  had me sitting on the edge of my seat ... A true craftsman at work...
YOU SIR! Are a master! Thank You!
Cracking open that watch was like opening King Tut's tomb
I always wonder where and how he remembers where the various sized screws go.
did you really keep all that Radium intact, in the dial?
To who is it worth 100k? Not for me… nothing special.
I have a pocket watch that my boys bought me has a quartz movement would like to change it to a mechanical movement could you help me
I love that one of your Patreon supporters is "Fluffy, Bringer of Doom."  LOL.
What a beautiful watch and what an amazing work you did on this one! Thanks for sharing.
The crystal reminds me of what acrylic looks like after it comes into contact with alcohol.
Service non conforme agli standard Rolex ….. e Metodo di lubrificazione completamente errato !!!

Just WoW, i think everyone else has said everything. Sir you are a Legend, thank you.
You do not polish the case ?  Anyway impressive work .
Good job.  Love the video.  Lots of cool info.   I find your videos relaxing  Keep up the good work. Look forward on your next video
Too many ads one every 5 minutes
What an amazing video, thanks.
Brilliant... absolutely mesmerizing. There is no CGI infused action flick that comes close to the level of tension and excitement from your detailed, loving, restoration. Thanks
Just found your channel.  I run a Watch Repair company in the UK called 'Watch Repair UK' which I have done for 12 years.  Great work.
Man this video was so amazing. I love Rolex’s and to see the inner workings left me speechless. So many people take for granted the craftsmanship and quality that goes into a Rolex. Thanks again for sharing this with the world!
Fantastic!
Beautiful work. Thanks for the videos. :)
Just curious i have a Rolex submariner from 1979 it was back then special issue. It has fixed lugs a grey Nato strap and the pussers arrow on the back. Would you like to clean and service this watch ?
I loved looking at you work because I would have no patience. Great
What a beauty, great job.
Enjoyed watching you save a piece of engineering history. Keep up the good work.
Google 'radium girls' and you'll see how dangerous that stuff is.
I was watching the channel a couple of months ago and saw the tool at 22:22 and ordererd one from Otto Frei in San  Francisco, CA.
Radium... Radium _errywhere..._
1st question...is that Jimmy Diresta watch? And I wanted to see how u cleaned the lense...or how u removed the scratches...
I never knew Seth Rogen was into watches.
Fascinating, would love to try this on a cheap watch, i know i would break something or lose a piece, how much would a resto like this cost?
I love when my gaskets are supple. 😂
I have been watching your videos for a while now and always wondered so I just have to ask, the "tool" that you use to spread the oil is it a saryinge or something that resembles a needle
Used to have Rolex watches many many years ago, and I had a GMT master, and I also had a submariner. That was the most beautiful video of reconstruction of a relic that I’ve ever seen. Congratulations.
Thanks
MR ROLEX became sixty five years old this november (11/58-11/23) Happy birthday to you, MR. Rolex perfection! And OF COURSE, all due respect to you the technician and specialist sir- an absolute wonder & intricate trade/ art form,❤sir.   God bless you and your family - they must be so utterly proud of you, AND FOR GOOD REASON! good nite, sir.
Fantastic!  I'm in AWE!
Jeffery Epstein didn't off himself.
OMG this video is so nice to watch, amazing job and incredible watch. RIP to the old guy it seems he did wear this watch a lot!
So interesting. I'm a vintage motorcycle technician and always wondered what's inside a watch ⌚.. And seems like I just hit the watch of the watches. So interesting. Soo interesting. Greetings from Italy 👍
Is this the most expensive watch you've worked on?
Stunning
I understand replacing the crystal, but i would rather have the old crystal, cuz granddad wore ut that way. Just me though. Well done. Beautiful watch.
Oppenhiemer watch
Man I love your videos. I especially love watching them at night right before bed or as I’m going to sleep. I’ll turn on a playlist of his videos and fall asleep to them. They are so relaxing. Screw ASMR videos, this is where the euphoria is!  Also I’m pretty sure the crystal cracked either something heavy was on it or from some other type of pressure like diving too deep.
way too many adds in the video
Wow. I have never seen a video like this before. I am so glad it came up. You are great at your commentary and obviously your craftsmanship. It amazes me the complexity and precision of a watch. Lovely to watch well done
Original colt M-16 plastic use the same stuff. Pretty durable.
@wristwatch.reviva3  this person is posting your videos on TikTok and he is very disrespectful to people that comment on the videos.
YouTube suggestion got me here. I know nothing about watch restoration or your work, and seeing all these little bits laying side by side without labelling gives me anxiety. I would not know how to put it back!!! Respect!
Man that thing is gorgeous. Nice refurb, I enjoyed your apprehension as you cleaned up the case and bezel 😂
Excellent
Fascinating, skillful artisan’! I’m so grateful to find your YouTube video! I’ve never seen anyone so steady and precise in hand movement. I’m literally dizzy with astonishment over the number of moving parts, seals, connections, pieces you are disassembling with ease! Thank you for your engaging narrative! World class truly ELITE Craftsmanship!
nice
I am overjoyed to see such an amazing watch actually worn throughout life.. that thing has been through everything.. if only it could talk!
Great work, amazing! I have one question, what solvent do you use for cleaning?
Is it possible this is one has radium (radioactive ☢️) hands??
Radium!?
I owned that watch when I was a kid (8). Handed down to me by my dad. I tossed it around like it was nothing. Fast forward 34 years and I had no idea what treasure I was holding :(
so what were these going for in 1958? and i love that the OG owner probably wore that watch everywhere for who knows how many decades. Testament to the lasting power of a good watch.
I just picked up a Stauer Moonphase watch off of eBay, just something cheap to teach myself.. But I have to tell you it is an absolute NIGHTMARE to learn on!!!
do you ever worry about scratching internal parts with the metal tweasers?
Back In '98, I Got Engaged & Was Also Looking At A Rolex Black Bezel Submariner That Was About $3,000. I Really Wish I Would've Not Gotten Engaged & Purchased The Rolex Instead. That Would've Saved Me Sooo Much Money!! 😂
Beautiful work 🎉🎉🎉
What’s the worth now?
Right after @43:06 it looked like the GMT hand made contact with the (slightly convex) Radium paint.  Might that scuff the face/paint over time as it rotates?
There's no effing way Marshall the Magician will be able to do anything with that wat...ch. Holy smokes, you should not only be happy with the outcome Marshall, but very proud as well.
Hey buddy, just had to tell you watched your most recent video. Enjoyed it as always! Trying to fall asleep tonight, in my Google feed pops a nice little write up by Supercar Blondie about your restoration. Glad to see you’re getting some recognition. Well deserved.
Stunning!
I can't imagine being able to put every single part and screw back in its proper place.
That is a stunning, stunning watch. My gosh, seeing it all come together, those after shots, what can you say about a restoration like this. Well done and what a beautiful piece of watch history.
I love that these videos never feel like they are 45+ mins long. Well done!
I know you said that about the Mercedes hand that the bars are there so the illuminate stuff doesn't run around but what about all the big dogs around the numbers. They don't have those.
Wow! Awesome job!!! ❤❤❤
Is this Marshall? From limited resources!?!
This was an awesome video. Great job
I would have liked to have seen the owners face when this watch was returned to them.
Kingsbury?
What an incredible watch, an absolute beauty. I am so jealous. Well done
Well this watch is 1/4'th the value of my  house. While I love these watches I can't afford them.
You must have been really good at Operation
18:33 screwdriver oof
Incredible work, it is completely magical for me to watch you disassemble and put the watch back together!
I'm guessing that the grandfather was an aviator?  That crystal has what we call "crazing" that comes from UV rays breaking down the polymer.   We see it a lot in the aircraft industry and also in the newer automotive headlight assembly covers.
Are you related to PETER SUTCLIFFE? He was the YORKSHIRE RIPPER over here in England! My mates dad was the police officer that caught him initially in his car.
Phenomenal!!!
Lol your wearing finger condoms..? Why not just wear gloves lol
Hey Marshal! Long time viewer here. You got me into watchmaking and I do some very very basic watch repair! Could you do a video or series about your tools? Not the “very basic” stuff but maybe more in-depth about how to use and choose a lathe, chronograph and other such bibs and bobs? For a guy like me who doesnt have much to spend and needs to really save up for any sort of purchase a review/ how to use video on your more “experienced” equipment would be great! Where do i go to get parts? Do i ebay random bulk buys of parts or buy individual as I need? Which and where to get your deruster? Anyways thanks again man!
Will this beautiful resto devalue such a rare Rolex?
That was great! Amazing job as always, thanks Marshall!;-)
I play your videos on 1.5x playback speed and it seems very natural still
Wonderful video, BUT, did I miss it or did you forget to show how the bezel moved once reinstalled? surely it did as when you clicked it on it was in a different position, but still, oooooh to see it move....I was waiting ... :-)
How can you tell the difference between a real Rolex and a fake?
Cool that you got to work on something so old and valuable. I am an aircraft mechanic at a major airline but volunteer at a museum every now and then working on still flying warbirds. Really cool to have a hand in keeping history alive like you are doing with this watch.
I don't care how radioactive it is, I would wear it once in a while and kiss it every day.
He is AWESOME. Can’t believe I haven’t seen this before.
Excellent work!
I recently got my dads 50yr old Tudor Sub back that was issued to him when he was a navy deep sea diver back in the earlt 70's. I wish i had a play by play like this on my watch restoration
if that has a blue parachrom hairspring, then it must have been serviced sometime in the last 23ish years right?
I'm curious if you know why if you google watches they always depict the time of 10:08 on their dials or even digitally?
Outstanding work my man.
Teach me how to work on these. Sheeesh!
I have a 1958 sub mariner is it worth anything?
i don't see the beauty of these watches. but it's interesting how someone has CREATED this fake vintage market , and made some watch nuts go crazy over them !. it's called great marketing.... anyways. superb service.
THAT WATER IS CONTAMINATED DONT DROP IT IN SINK EVER I AM SERIOUS THAT RADIOACTIVE INK IS NO JOKE
very cool.. excuse my ignorance, but does the bezel turn again, now?? sorry for asking, my 1st video here
Did it really only take 1 hour?
wow. It's a watch. imma charge you 100k usd for it.
I wonder whether the missing end link caused a drop, damaging the crystal and prompting it to get put away, rather than an issue with the movement.
Awesome job
Fabulous 👏🏼 how do they make the components? Seriously?!
I winced when I heard the clicks of the bezel being installed.   Thanks for the ride. That watch is nothing short of amazing .
This had me mesmerized to watch. How would I find a reputable watch repairer for my Breitling Super Avenger? Thanks
Am I the only one got excited to see the second had moving while he was removing all of the hands?  :)
Wow!!!  Best restoration EVER!  Amazing work, and thanks for showing us your process!
How were they engineering parts so small in the 50's!! That's mind blowing..
Hey Marshall, I got into you a couple of years ago watching your videos, and it just came across. I subscribed great to see these videos again.😊
I was eating a piece of bread while he pointed out all the gunk that was stuck on this watch. I also imagined if some of that gunk somehow got dropped inside the bowl while I was baking the bread I was eating. The microscope with the close ups of gunk and peg wood  is too graphic to watch while eating. God forbid if someone ever were to eat watch gunk from 50+ year old watches. I'm sure there's a youtube channel for that sort of activity too right?
That was unbelievable very enjoyable to watch It's amazing Love before and after  what a work of art Awesome video
talk less bro dayum im tryna sleep
Great video, Marshall, your enthusiasm (awe?) is contagious.  At about 40:05 there are wear patterns on the underside of the rotor.  I noticed mating patterns on the bridges.  Now seeing the underside of the rotor bridge I see wear patterns too; where those un-jeweled wheels spin.  Could wear on those winding parts lead to play in the rotor pivot causing scraping like that?  My other theory is that the rotor center plate is sorta flexy (it seemed to be moving pretty much about 47:30) and under heavy shocks it's striking the bridges.
Let me tell you something. I dont care much about watches. I dont wear watches. BUT... I just sat here and watched the entire 52 minites of this video. Why? I have no idea. Maybe your voice was extra calming? Impressive work though!
I think these are often referenced as a "Pepsi" watches because of the red/blue bezel colors.
This is mesmerizing.
Marshall, Awesome job as always!  I love watching your content.  I just recently purchased a 1963 GMT from a former Marine who's father is the original owner whom purchased it in Vietnam.  I have a question about the dial face.  The one on the one I have is same as this one except for my dial has "SWISS - T < 25" under the 6 o'clock illum.  Can you provide any insight into the difference in the dial?  Thank you for your time.  Kevin
Fantastic footage and very interesting, really great content & a nice one for a 1st time viewer! 👍
Walking around with Chernobyl strapped to his wrist 😂
Incredible.👏 Just a joy to ‘watch’ a skilled, talented person and so therapeutic to listen to. I noticed that you were wearing a Rolex, is that your favourite personal watch and what model is it?
Great piece! Also, that MV7 sounds wonderful! ;-)
Stunning time piece - brought back perfectly .
Very Rad ☢️
You've got a DM waiting on IG!
are the gold looking wheels gold plated or are they solid?
I didn’t know Seth Rogen was this talented!  Amazing to see.
Ok so this is why me Le Jour isn't getting attention, lol, you got GMT masters on the desk.
They had a radon leak in a well in tomah Wisconsin and it didn't stop them that it's okay to drink it. They had signs all over every restaurant saying how safe it is to drink the water. By the way I love watching you fix old watches
How did this affect the overall value of the watch? Is it still a $100k watch and certified by Rolex? Just curious. Great job as well!!
stunning job what a time piece
Beautiful. But is it safe to wear with the radium? I own a late 60’s watch with the same luminous material and the internet has terrified me to the point that I won’t touch it  even with a 10 foot pole. 😂 Your thoughts on that?
I have a similar watch from the 50s mine is a sub and I would love to restore it please let me know if we can talk.
Rolex watch back then cost around 1 max 2 month average US paycheck. Now cost around 10-15 times this average paycheck.
..says "Content had to be good enough to make it onto mainstream TV or Radio"  while producing content that easily exceeds the production quality of mainstream TV or Radio
I had something similiar to this happen to me. My Father had always been a collector of watches and over the years had some real rolex an some fake. When he passed all I asked for was to go through his collection, which all turned out to be fake. Years pass by and I found an old rolex box that low and behold has a non working beat up submariner from the 60's in it. I take it to a Rolex watch dealer and immediately the guy offers me $5k in cash for a beat up Rolex. Well i was born in Zurich so I still have friends in Switzerland. Long story short it turns out its a rare type and worth...you guessed it worth a $100k with provenance....problem is I dont have the original paperwork, but still worth a lot to me.
I really enjoyed watching this. This is a beautiful watch! Glad to see it come to life
Impressive 👍!
This dude is the Bob Ross of watches.
Absolutely fascinating, how long did it take you to learn this skill, do any of these movements catch you out?, my eye (i think) picked up that the new crystal looks somewhat more "square" than the original a bit like the two versions of the omega speedmaster...kept me watching from start to finish thank you.
Masterful
I would love to see the revel to the client...  that's a beautiful piece of history there,  but more importantly Family History.
impressive GMT, I have my fathers GMT . It came with a leather rolex band with the logo on the clasp. He bought it used in Panama in 59 or 60. It runs great but sits in a drawer most of the time. How did you find out the Value of these?
It's remarkable how you preserved the character and history of this gem.
Bravo, what an episode!
How much do you charge for this? Your work is amazing!
Can't leave without putting a Thank you comment for this video. I'm not into watches too much but man...., it's so satisfying watching you restoring it back as a brand new one.. Keep up the good works!
Sweet Vintage piece!! Thrilled to see you work on this vintage watch...I know that was so crazy to work on!!!!!!
was trying to figure out why this voice was so familiar then i saw the name lol. from pro tour coverage to watch restorations who would have thought
Minor thing I really enjoy about your videos. I know that you narrate them after you do the work, but I like when you narrate a grunt when straining as if you’re doing the work and talking as it’s happening. Adds a comical element to me. Love the videos though can’t wait for the next one.
Amazing job and a very profecional work on it
WOW! Just wow!!
I'm not even a Rolex fan, but those GMT Master videos are may favourite from Marshall. There's something about this model, perhaps one of the last tool watches really made with a unique and novel (at the time) purpose.
I'm in total shock about the price of this Rolex, I'm gasping how it turned out.😅
I'm going to assume the bezel rotated after you cleaned it other wise great video
Genau und ich glaube natürlich alles, was mir irgendein Spinner im Internet erzählt!
Do you take submissions? ive got this extremely small omega deville quartz i intended to get running for my wife but i think im too scared haha. it needs a new battery and a cleaning. it is TINY .5" wide by 1" long rectangular
nice :)
☢️
Magic moment thx
OMG is all I can think of watching you do this! I have a hard time taking out a screw from a lawnmower. You are a master sir!
Amazing find! What a dream.
You have the patience of a Patron Saint !
I had a Rolex GMT in the late 80's but had to sell it because of a layoff in the early 90's - I always wanted to replace it but now days they are too much $$$.
Absolutely wonderful. What a beautiful watch.
Just curious, what would one expect to pay for a Rolex cleaning of that watch, stipulating that no parts were needed? Meticulas work for sure. I appreciate your knowledge and history, as well as your confidence.
70 to 100.000 is a bunch of money
The crystal is probably radium damaged.
I actually thought the original Chrystal looked so cool! Would of been amazing to leave it and preserve the patina!
What a great video , new subscriber
Are you also own Rolex Pepsi?
You would be handy with prolapsed hemorrhoids...tried poking mine back in but made a complete mess of my arse,now i need surgery
I really enjoyed your video thank you! It’s exciting to see when things don’t go according to plan, like the crown replacement. Thank you for such an intriguing view of an old Rolex!
Just beautiful and great work. Was a pleasure watching this. Thank you!
I was memorized every second of the work!
You keep the radioactive paint?
This red black is bringing out a childhood memory in my head so now im gonna think i coulda been rich all week.
Stunning watch so beautiful
Absolutely amazing work. Thank you for sharing this
your channel is making me like rolex again. seeing the watches they used to make and what they made it for compared to what its known now, i must say i started to not like rolex. but being reminded of their history is great.
Why do you wear finger condoms instead of latex gloves?
Should have put that watch in a lead box xD
Ha Ha, I just bought an inexpensive watch tool kit off Amazon. (I think it's more of a watch battery replacement kit. Headed over to your new web site. (kit was only 30 bucks bought it on black Friday for 15.)  I'm 59 and this might be a good hobby. Thank you sir.
This watch is not worth 100k
Respect? I have nothing but contempt for someone that does not clean off the plethora of  DISGUSTING dead skin cells, rancid body oils,  and virulent germs from their petri dish of a watch. I clean ALL my watches regularly with a soft toothbrush, warm water and baby shampoo. No less than weekly. I deep clean any watch I am placing out of rotation for a while.  While I am a huge proponent of germs in our life to maintain a healthy immune system, this sort of rancid disgusting treatment of a watch is criminal. I am old. Very old. The day I can't regularly keep my watches sparkling clean,  is the day I need to stop wearing watches!.... and pass my collection down. Geriatric caretakers!!!!! Take notice of your drooling charges. CLEAN their watches as you would their bodies!!! Don't even get me started on the stench and foulness  of unwashed hat bands!!!
Hey Marshall, just love your enthusiasm, your detailed explanation whilst focussing and working. I am amazed at the size of the individual components when they are not magnified. I think there can be no argument whenI say you are a master craftsman with a great attitude. Cheers from Australia
Outstanding!
It would be interesting to see you adjust the running rate. When my 3035 Submariner was serviced last year, I asked my watchmaker to set it to run slightly fast. A watch that runs fast makes you early; a watch that runs slow makes you late. Fun video.
There is no way this scrape metal is worth 100k
That CPM is almost double the amount of radiation found at Fukushima power plant!
$70-$100k truely sad. Piece of metal worth more than children.
You're one of the people adding mythology to those watches. No, it's not the most beautiful. It's just a very worn-out, quite old watch. Piece of junk wrapped in 100k. It is expensive on the collectors market, and would be bought to sell at even higher price in a few years. It's just an investment. The price isn't because it's so awesome and pretty. It's because of the crazy bubble, which will probably eventually break, like all the other collectors bubbles. Read about tulip mania, and in a recent years, a vintage video game bubble, which is breaking on our eyes right now. This was built in 1958 and been bought by a random guy, worn for years and then dumped into a drawer. When it was bought, it costed nowhere near current new Rolex prices. Again, because of the bubble and luxury market created around the business. Why was it dumped and forgotten? Probably because the service was not worth the money, the owner bought some electronic, better watch, and that Rolex wasn't worth big money at the time, so even servicing it and selling wasn't worth the time.
The last time I saw that much human DNA was on an episode of CSI.
Amazing work, love the camera angles and scenes. Fantastic. Are you not worried working with Radium, it's kinda dangerous stuff to be lying around on the bench like that
wow - that was fun! you made my insomniac night better.
Beautiful restoration! Honestly, I'd be a bit apprehensive even to own and wear a watch like this, let alone work on one. I've handled vintage GMTs (aluminium bezel models, so after this one) and they feel so dainty and fragile. Coupled with how valuable they are today, real respect to you for taking on this job, and getting such a fantastic result!
great colour
How much did this watch cost new back in the day? Was it easy to find? Awesome video...thank you.
I couldn’t do this as a hobby as I shake to much but I do enjoy watching your videos
Far out. Great stuff mate. Was the original crystal acrylic? And what type of crystal did you use to replace it? Cheers
The organisation of those parts is giving me anxiety.
I'm just a simple guy. I see a new video has been uploaded, I drop everything and click play.
Fantastic 👍
I know a guy who would pay top dollar for this, far more than toms bobs or Harry’s dealers
beautiful.
👌 👍
Excellent!
I just love the idea of total disassembly of a mechanical item and proper reassembly, love the videos BTW, watches are way too small but anything else is fare game, I have the first part 100%, the next bit has always been a problem for me, I think ill get the required satisfaction from watching your videos, a big thanks from a tinkerer
Man that bezel is worth as much as a new car!
When u adjusted the time at the end of the video, the red hand and the hour hand moved out of sinc. Is that supposed to happen? I thought they were both hour hands.
Ive been watching your videos for awhile now. I really enjoy the way you present everything and your knowledge on the subject. Ive learned quite a bit. The reason im commenting though is because that is the best looking watch Ive ever seen you work on just gorgeous. Kudos
This must have been a very nerve wrecking watch restauration. 😅
Fantastic video. I usually don’t comment but I’m an avid fan and I am thinking about taking this up as a hobby thanks to you.
Beautiful! This is the reason I'm becoming a watchmaker!
Fun, fun!  🎉
Did the service help with its radioactivity?
What a very good mecahical engineering product, how many parts totally in this watch ?
In your previous life , you must have been a brain surgeon !!!!!!!🤣
I LOVE your passion.
This was very satisfying to watch you work on that beautiful vintage watch. I absolutely love the bakelite red and blue colors and the patina. You explain everything that you're doing very expertly. Thank you so much for this experience.
How on Earth does one get these kind of skills ? You make everything look so easy, but it’s not, it’s extremely difficult
I would love to know the reaction of the people who get the watches back. I love your stuff, but it’s almost like you leave us hanging :)
Circumcision is a crime.
As much as I’ve heard about the born to fly spring, I kinda wanna see it happen lol
Classy “shabby” chic .. amazing watch 😎👍🏻❤️
It amazing how you can work on the very small complex watches & it amazes me how they manufacture these small devices
You have got me hooked,I can’t pass by any old watch.All my friends have given me their old none working watches to tear apart.I was a tool and die maker for 30yrs,now retired.Even being a machinist I don’t know how some of these microscopic parts are made wow !Thanks for the inspiration an how to’s  👍
Boy oh boy alright
I have 2 exams in the morning, and here I am watching your video.. watched every second of it.. great work.
Watches and pocket knives are some of the best classic items because they are ment to be used.
These videos are like inspiration and therapy all in one. I've done watch modding, but I've always been too afraid to work on the movements aside from a complete swap. I've got my grandmother's tiny Omega that needs a service, maybe after watching enough of these I'll get brave enough to try and fix it.
52 amazing minutes, amazing work👌
OKAY that was cool. That's the kind of family heirloom you dream about being passed down to you.
Could use a clean up and bracelet tune up on a gmT II about 23 years old
Well done!
As a person planning on studying horology at uni in a few years time I might have to check out some of these toolkits in the mean time to get myself acquainted with the subject.
How are you at retuning the bracket on a GMT II ?
fake bakelite bezel, wrong later dial repreinted , maybe 15K , not 100
I think this is likely one of the best videos I have watched on YouTube!   Thank you.
What a absolute masterclass
💯
I would very much advise you to get a dish or something to put the different pieces in.  You put the face and calendar date etc in cases. But all the tiny screws and parts are just sitting on your tabletop.  Not smart if you ask me. Damage or losing them just has me cringing
Lol wow imagine wasting 100k for a watch
Magic the Gathering playmat! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Nice job, Marshall‼️👏🏼
What an absolutely gorgeous piece of art. Very well done, hope the customer was as happy as you were with the restoration.
Giving me anxiety with each layer of wheels and components you take off 😂. A pleasure to watch otherwise. Great to  how you are so passionate about your craft.
I used to watch a lot of mtg pro tour on YouTube and you sound exactly like Marshall Sutcliffe. I miss those days when I could watch a big event every other week
Been watching you for a while now and really enjoy your work and explanation. I’m in Australia 🇦🇺 and have my mother’s Rolex Tudor Oyster Lady 1955-56. She bought it new when she was 18 and doing her nursing training. My thumbnail is larger than this watch 😊. It still keeps really good time but needs a new crystal and hasn’t had a service in over 50 years. Having a really hard time finding anyone to do it because of its size. Just wondering if you know anyone who would be willing to do it?
I’ve never had any interest in this kind of stuff, more of a crime documentary type viewer. But I can’t stop watching your videos. (No pun intended 😂) I love what you do and will be a long time supporter of your channel sir. Thank you!
Seems as though radiation causes crystal crazing.
Absolutely loved this video! BTW the crystal bezel is an amazing example of what happens to Sapphire crystal exposed to radiation from the Radon. the Radiation causes the crystal to concentrate heat on the side the crystal is most exposed to it. the radon gas and whatever sun it received caused the internal of the crystal to increase in heat and cause cracks thorough the structure from thermal expansion and contraction.
36:48 - isopropyl alcohol is pretty good solvent, but if you are looking for REALLY good solvent you may want to check out cyclohexanone. Boy, it really does miracles - it can even dissolve solidified oil paint (the one they used on old paintings) or hardened boiled linseed oil. Speaking of which, you mentioned earlier "dried (out) oils" (oils they used earlier to lubricate watches) - strictly speaking those oils (fats) don't "dry", they "set" or "harden" - just like gypsum or concrete doesn't just "dry" (although it becomes dry after pouring/ plastering onto a wall), they SET hard. For natural oils, or "fats", aka triglycerides (i..e esters of glycerine and higher fatty acids), the process involves oxygen from the air oxidising them and cross-linking of molecules, making them essentially insoluble in any "regular" organic solvent. However, cyclohexanone (an alicyclic ketone, a cousin of regular acetone, the simplest member of ketones family) can actually penetrate the structure of hardened oils/ fats and dissolve it.  In this case I'd bet if you just place that watch case in cyclohexanone overnight the entire seal would either be dissolved or turned into a soft jelly - so a simple swipe with a bamboo toothpick would remove it completely. But keep in mind that cyclohexanone has a very distinctive and VERY strong smell - not strictly unpleasant, but it tends to fill the air pretty quickly and stay around whenever it is used. Some people may actually like it, some find it annoying, but it's not toxic and not irritating. It's just very intense and persistent.  It also does work great for old, stone hard dried out old brushes too- wet such brush with cyclohexanone, wrap it tight in aluminium foil, leave it for couple of days or a week, and then just wash with your regular "universal thinner" (typically made of/ containing acetone and butyl acetate).  Also, silicone grease - it's called "grease" but those silicone based compounds (like lab grade grease for grounded conical glass joints or silicone sprays) have somewhat different properties than "normal" greases. They are first and foremost anti-stick agents (silicone spray is a great thing for your car doors "gaskets" - spray them a little with it at the autumn and you'll never have to worry about them getting freeze-stuck to the car body!), and they do a good job as lubricants for all things made of plastics and rubber. Also, they prevent  ageing of rubber. But "metal on metal" grease? Well, not really. Cleaning really delicate stuff (like that bezel ring) - try ammonium carbonate solution, (NH4)2CO3. Works better than plain water, leaves no residue, as any ammonium carbonate left on the watch parts will slowly decompose into ammonia gas, carbon dioxide (alo gas) and water.
2 seconds in and I'm thinking... "this dude has hotdog fingers" First time watching. Great work!
Can you do a video on how to spot a superclone Rolex?  Replicas are getting better and better and nowadays is hard to trust someone outside ADs!
What a waste of money! No watch should ever cost that much.
Not sure how I got here, but I sure love all things mechanical and have a new appreciation for the absolute insanity that is inside one of these.
I own two Smoking Pipes made with Bakalite.  They are called “The Pipe”.
Why do you lube the jewels in the bridge after assembly rather than when the bridge is off and before you place it on the train?  I'm just curious.
It's almost like these Rolex watches always WANT to run, but are being held back. I guess it's a bit weird to anthropomorphize watches like that.
Nice job
Judging By the Force You Had to Put On the Backplate marshall I would say You are the  First Specialist To Work On the watch since it was made Sir  .
Respect man. You just earned a subscriber. Keep up the good work. Masterful.
Wow so mesmezising to watch! I really  enjoyed watching it. Job well done too.
the MtG playmat tho
Why don't the teeth on the gears get greased? Honestly want to know because its metal on metal.
Could the crystal have cracked (crazed) because of Radium radiation exposure for so long?
Outstanding job!!! Thumbs up. Absolutely beautiful watch
Marshall, I think you should know that I often grind my Arena daily challenges while listening to these videos. Kind of a fun cross-over of our shared interests 😊
I love Rolex but I will never buy one of thouse is not prity with 170.000 I will buy 20 Rolex
I'm working on a beautiful Dufonte Lucien Piccard Automatic and the click spring launched. Anyone know where I can order one from? I'm almost there with this watch, but I need the spring.
Not into watch making but this had all my attention
How do you possibly remember where all those parts go??? Great respect.
Impressive work. Just wondering, due to the fact that rubber gaskets don't age well - wouldn't it be better to replace rubber gaskets with silicone equivalents? All the best, T
The crystal was damaged by a solvent I am sure. This is exactly what many plastics do when repeatedly exposed to alcohols and some other plastics when exposed to bleach.
I most likely can get spare parts if needed.
Dang!!  That’s beautiful!!
It is amazing you can remember where each part goes.
Something popped off at 15:36 and lost itself inside the thingamajig.
Who went to the Moon First?
Amazing work. one of my favorite models/references. So lucky to have an original bakelight in your hands!
Awesome video. Just great
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Fake.... u suppose to miss out 1 screw driver
i could watch these all day, feel like the bezel was off center by a touch but amazing job
Just crazy how beautiful the watch looks after you finished your work, absolutely stunning!
Read "Radium Girls", a book about the young women who painted the watches and other instruments with radium paint.
Awesome !now you have to take a video of the owner receiving the watch 🙂 and look at it for the first time
Mindblowing talent to do this job.you dont want to find a screw under the tool box after you have put it together lol
Sad how my brand new 2023 Datejust 36 Lume is pure shit in comparison to that
Brilliant trade craft ❤
It seems to me as though that crystal was crazed by age, exposure to sunlight or maybe a chemical of some kind, rather than being subjected to a shock. Plastics were in their infancy in those days. I have seen the transparencies from aeroplanes of that era that have a similar pattern of crazing, especially in high-traffic areas or parts subjected to weather and heat, like landing light covers. Assuming that's not a glass crystal of course. It looks like acrylic or lexan or something to me.
Very nice video! "Oiling up the jewels" 😃
Another great video, but with a watch of this significance and cost I am having great difficulty forgetting that you pushed down on the entire wheel train bridge with a bare acidic finger during reassembly @ 25:11.  At least in another 50 years forensics will know exactly who last serviced it!  🥺😉
I have never owned a Rolex...I am not a watch guy...I have zero clue what is happening...and I just watched this entire video.  That's saying something =)
Bravo.. Narration as well as technical prowess all top shelf. Thank you kind sir.
❤
the skunge on that watch looks like sweat and dead skin cells.
So satisfying to watch.👌🏼
Another amazing job. Superb watch too. Very pretty and with a history you just can't buy. Regards from Argentina (now with a liberal government to asume on december 10th)
Wow, just wow that is a real beauty Marshall, it was awesome to see you working on it. Thank you 😊👍
Should you even restore a rare watch like this?
and in 58'  this was probably  less than $200
Wow this one is a stunner What a find
Ouch. Chemist here. It REALLY gives me toothache when I hear phrases like "highly poisonous radon gas". People, were you sleeping on your high school chemistry classes, or what? Radon is a NOBLE gas - that means, it DOES NOT REACT (at lest not easily) with anything, so it just CAN'T be "poisonous". Plain and simple, eh?   The issue with radon is that it is a radioactive gas (hence the name) - but not POISONOUS. Phosgene is highly poisonous, and so is hydrogen cyanide. Radon IS NOT. BTW, same goes for "radium" - and both names are derived from Latin noun "radius", meaning "ray". And yes, radium does produce radon, but the amount is so miniscule (and stretched in time) that you'd have to spent Elon Musk's fortune on such watches and keep them next to your bed for next couple of years to actually get any results.  In fact, some people actually go to caves containing radon (which is a product of uranium decay - U –> Th –> Ra –> Rn; youtube.com/watch?v=zZkusjDFlS0) as in small quantities it is actually beneficial to one's health (or so is believed, see "radiation hormesis"). Anyway, the "radon issue" is actually about PROLONGED and CONSTANT EXPOSURE TO IT, as in some places is seeps from underground, through cracks in the bedrock, and being an extremely heavy gas (nearly 10 g/ dm3, or "litre", or approx. 7.5 times denser than air) it tends to accumulate in cellars and other underground cavities. If not breathed in, CONSTANTLY, it's pretty harmless, as alpha rays (emitted by both radon and radium, and while at it, polonium too) are stopped by few centimetres of air - or a sheet of paper.  When breathed in (or ingested, in case of radium or polonium) it does not "poison" you, it's just that alpha radiation, being a stream of relatively heavy and big particles (essentially, nuclei of helium gas) damages stuff in our body cells easily, so it causes this thing called radiation damage. NOT "poisoning". Or, to put it in more "American perspective and experience", it's like saying "he died of lead poisoning" when some unfortunate fellow accumulated few .44 magnum bullets in his body. Yes, lead IS in fact "poisonous", and yes, he's got more than a lethal dose of it, but "lead poisoning" wasn't the cause of his demise.  Speaking of radon, radium and watches - we all know the sad story of them Radium Girls, who would be perfectly safe and would live till their old age (bar car accidents or such) if SIMPLE safety precautions were observed back then - that is, "never touch this stuff with your hands, better yet use rubber gloves (disposable ones!) and do the actual dial painting in a fume hood like contraption - so any airborne particle of radium paint (highly unlikely occurence, still better safe than sorry) could not get on you". And then, just to be on a safe side, wash your hands after work, thoroughly. But (reportedly) they were told specifically to keep those brushes "sharp and pointy" (so the digits on dials will be nice and sharp) WITH THEIR MOUTHS. Now, it couldn't get any dumber than that, but hey, American education shining through. Or perhaps rather "lack of thereof", but who am I to decide...  Anyway, those stupid directives caused what they caused - still, the amount of radium/ alpha radiation those girls were exposed to would have blown this puny whatever meter of yours straight through the ceiling, so no need to worry about this watch. The fact that something is hundred times more radioactive than something basically non-radioactive (aka "at background radiation level") means NOTHING - it's like saying "a microsecond is thousand times longer than a nanosecond" - still, for us, humans, they both essentially means "very, very short period time". Did you know there's more attoseconds in one seconds that seconds since Big Bang? Or that bananas produce antimatter in your body? Or that the wooden chair you're sitting on may produce as much as fifty THOUSANDS of beta decays every second? No? So now you know... ;-)  Now, repeat after me, hundred times:  Radon IS NOT poisonous. Radon IS NOT poisonous. Radon IS NOT poisonous. Radon IS NOT poisonous. Radon IS NOT poisonous. ....... : )
18:53
Your website name have the ring to it to be a very expensive/exotic  custom watch brand ......
Really nice job at restoring such a beautiful piece of art!  However, i would advise you to change both hands and dial, because besides being toxic, Radium is highly radioactive and will cause deterministic effects to the one wearing this watch. Please be careful with ionizing radiation!
That's a perfect storm for fragile Bakelite.  It's pretty tough when it's new but it get brittle with age.  It's still fine if it's something with a thicker profile, like a distributor cap on a vintage car.  But a thin profile, a flexible backing, and over half a century old.  I'd be a nervous wreck working with that bezel.  :)
Nice work! What was the new crystal made out of?
This one was a DREAM to watch you work on!!
Wow! What an amazing watch, and as always, and amazing video! Thanks Marshall!!
Do you do this with the naked eye? Impossible
You Sir are a magician.  I own the current gmt master 2. The bakelite care you took was outstanding. 🎉
My grand-grand father used to build watches in the vallée de Joux where swiss watchmakers bloomed in the last two centuries. I never got the chance to see him work on a watch in his atelier as I was too young then. Seing you service this gorgious watch was therefore very emotional for me. Thank you so much for letting us in this universe of precision and human excellence. These living machines are so much more beautiful than juwels or current hightech electronics.
100,000 dollars for a watch that will eventually cause your hair to fall out and your ass to turn itself inside out.. erm I’ll pass thanks
I hope the newest owner wears it as much as the original owner. They are made to be worn. I wear mine instead of showing them off in a display.  You only live once.
isn't that the Che Guevarra model?
I assume the 'crystal' is actually plexiglass on a watch of this age, in which case crazing like that is very common.  Nice to see it so sympathetically restored to life.
Yeah...I'd rather watch videos like this than anything currently offered on TV.
What I wonder is, how much demand is there for watchmaker, watch repair services like this? I LOVE building and fixing stuff, have always LOVED watches and have been thinking about getting into this ever since coming across your channel...even more so since the launch of your website! Do you see much demand? Think it's something that would be able to be made into something more than just something for fun?
You've upped your game by taking on a big coin piece. Very brave and shows you've reached the Big Leagues!
Nicely done. One should be proud to know one has reached a level of competence in their trade that the owner of such an item would pick them to restore it. Do you mail ssomething like that, and if so, how do you handle the insurance? If you put a high insurance value on it, it may make it a target for theft. One has to let the carrier know the value of the item, or they will not be responsible for the full value. Perhaps if one puts a $200,000 value on the item, they use special carriers.
Thanks for a great video.  I'm wondering if you did any cleaning of the face.
Hope you took some iodine before you started this project 😂
Ok, so we now know what got Grandpa 😳 ☢️
hey after my parents passed this last  year, my dad left us a few Rolexes  are  you game to fix them as they arent working. not winding or functioning. any ideas of cost per watch.  hope you can help soo we dont have to go to rolex direct which is who always serviced them
Do you have to buy Rolex gaskets as replacements?
Stunning job, well done, I really enjoy your videos.......
you are amazing. i wish i had anywhere close to as a fulfilling job/talent/skill as you. Truly a master. Netflix needs to make a documentary about you like that sushi guy
I love this watch not because it’s a lot of money but it looks so beautiful and yes I would wear it everyday great job I would love to repair watches but I don’t think my hands would ever stay still 😅
So happy for you how it turned ou!!
Hate to be pedantic but....., radium decay is primarily alpha particles.  While the crystal on a watch cannot stop them, the human skin is very effective at blocking alpha particles.  The danger is primarily ingestion like the people who painted dials and hands with radium paint,  and licked the brushes to keep the bristles lined up.  Like anything, put a big hunk next to your skin, and you might get a radiation burn (Marie Curie).  Unless you swallow the dial or hands on that watch (or somehow inhale them), it is harmless.  You got balls working on a watch of that value.  I would likely be a wreck.
what was scratched into the back of that dial? looks like numbers
Love this!
Why doesn't he wash the hands and the dial? They are obviously dirty, it's not patina.
So people in 1950 were just walking around with nuclear reactors on their arm?
Overpriced.
Stunning!!
Question, Marshall: the goldtoned wheels--I presume they are goldplate? Or are they just really really clean brass?
Is it the similar as this watch model that you had restored previously? https://youtu.be/la2ztR5askE?si=qNAYbDuBYqr_13WU
The fact that you put those tiny parts right on the desk and not in a bowl or other receptacle is driving me insane. I would sneeze or brush them all off the desk with my hand by mistake.
Amazing❤
I knew the second I saw the year on this watch that it'd be crazy radioactive. Ah, the 50s--when we knew it was dangerous but just didn't care.

Hmm Shouldn't you had a pressure check before putting the movement back in? Just to check the water thightness.
I am not at all educated on this subject but the kind of crack reminds me of pressure stress. Something heavy might have been placed on the watch for a prolonged time by the look of it, maybe it fell somewhere for a while. Beautiful piece and narration. Wonderful watch
08:15 the time when Little Boy dropped. It means something happened in 06/18:08-09 and someones memory is just gone like cleaned coin.😢
WATCHED THIS IN 2X SPEED 👍👍 same video just not soooo slowww
Beautiful to experience.. A wonderful recovery
Too many adverts
Nice
Marshall I noticed you stopped at giving those bezel numbers a gentle clean with the toothbrush. Interested in your thought process. More likely to do damage I guess?
why did you take apart the automatic winding works on top of that solid hunk of metal?
awesome
I’m such a big fan of your content. This was such a cool restoration. If you ever decided to teach a course on vintage watch restoration I’d certainly sign me and my dad up ⏱️🥼💙. Happy holidays Sir Watchman 😎‼️
You are the reason I've been servicing my whole family's quarts watches 😂 simple stuff like putting the second hand back on, or replacing the movement completely. You are an inspiration my friend, thank you for the awesome content ❤
I don't care one bit about wrist watches, and if anything I look at Rolexes like yachts: something for rich jerks.  But your enthusiasm is beautiful. I am just so happy for you.
Amazing. Your videos feel like an enthralling bedtime story that I don’t want to end.  Btw, were you able to rotate the bezel at the end of the repair? Would have loved to see that
nice, thats how it has do be done, keep the patina and history, resp soul although its just a watch
Amazing
Such a good job! Is it safe to wear with all that radium in the modern day?
why didnt you clean the Jewels on this movement as in other cleanings ?
My heart skipped a beat when the bezel snapped back on.  I thought it cracked.  What a beauty
Those cracks in the crystal look very much like what happens when you attempt to clean acrylic with isopropyl alcohol.
As a mechanic for a very long time there are some things I would never mess with , this might be number 1 . As my age prevents me from doing certain things , I can say it would not back right .
Robots and AI maybe in but mechanical watch making and repair and ohh videos like this are going to be so timeless. A 52 min video that seems short is a menu any day! More power to your channel good sir!
I know nothing about watches but I think your issue with crown was that gasket inside crown
Acrylic will crack like that when leaned with alcohol.
One of the BEST I've seen you restore!!! Great job!! Cheers!!
There are Russian AK47 magazines made of bakelite.
I thought about getting into this from watching your videos. Until I saw how small these parts really are, because your videos do not do them justice in size.
When you said “Bakelite”, I thought:oh, oh! Yes, it is a material able to withstand immense heat (they use it as a shield in between the carburetor and the engine on air cooled motorcycles, but, if you hit it even lightly, they crack), but you were wise not to go crazy with the cleaning on it. Just beautiful watch. I had a vintage gold case Rolex, and  there was a time that no knock offs existed, would draw too much attention, and I ended up selling it to a collector. No regrets, I am very clumsy, and getting clumsier with age, but, great video. More and more amazed with your skills and patience. Thank you very much for sharing this video.
I wonder if the crack pattern on the old crystal is from the radiation put off by the dial?
VERY BEAUTIFUL EPIC TIMEPIECE
Looks like there was an impact on at the cyclops? A circular shockwave eventually spidering as there becomes more material to absorb the impact.  Might make sense given that the magnifier bubbles out a bit. It'd be the first thing to hit the ground in a fall.
I have to wonder if the radium dial and off-gassed radon are responsible for the degredation of the crystal.
Didnt know Seth Rogen does watch restoration. Top not content nevertheless
One thing it's a service dial, the original dials were gilt writing, without the original dial it's not worth anywhere near 100k  anyway great vid
100k for something that isn't very good at its primary job.  Lol, humans are silly people.
thank you that was awesome
I have a 1930's ebel with the same weird cracking on the crystal. It's in great shape otherwise and has a gold case. I hope to have it restored eventually
That watch would definitely be a hand reliever watch, ain't no way that's going through the mail lol
36:00 ULTRASONIC IS ABRASIVE  please educate yourself on US cleaning.
Thanks!
I don’t think I’d pay that much money to have radioactive material on my wrist.
Man ---  How do you remember how all those parts go back together ???  I love watching the detailed work you do as I know I couldn't do that to save my life !!!
My grandma's maiden name was Hansen small world.... Just won an eBay buy for an 1882 Elgin as my first go thanks to you... Keep up the great content!
Abosolute pleasure to watch a true craftsman at work a super 😎 cool watch for sure 🔥
Beautiful watch nice job
While reassembling, it looked like several of the screws had damage on them. It was hard to say if they were damaged before or during your disassembly. Is that normal/accepted for watch repair on screws that won't be seen?
There are many,impressive things about your work (not least how quickly you learned!) but what impresses me the most is your ethical approach to restoration. You always make the right decisions when it comes to how much to clean etc. Love this channel!
I'm really impressed with your skill. I only have one question. How do you keep track of all those screws?
Why would anyone pay so much for a watch? There’s nothing really special about it other than maybe the Rolex name?
Yes they were made for Pan Am pilots, as my father has one that he gave to me. I still wear it when flying. Its been service twice so the orginal crystal has been replaced.
This one was unbelievable. What a great find!
Not a collector but throughly enjoyed watching from beginning to end, skål from Canada.
Amazing work, I'm very impressed.
I’ve bought/sold/collected vintage Rolex tool watches for 35+ years and this is definitely a grail watch for many Rolex collectors. Your right to be nervous about the Bakelite bezel insert. It’s worth almost as much as the watch because it’s pretty much unattainium. To bad about the refinished dial or service dial. That really hurts it’s value. It should be a Gilt finished dial with enclosed track but even so it’s still a gorgeous piece. Great work bringing back this beauty
The other channels I subscribe to are very sad that I found your channel. What a terrific video and magnificent watch. Kudos to you.
In 1979, I bought a Rolex oyster Daytona for $50. I was 15, I'd heard of the name Rolex. I was at a church sale and the lady told me it was her husband's, and he'd died in the war. I wore it every day, got lots of people trying to buy it. I was out dirt bike riding, and later at home, I freaked out, when I realized it had fallen off somewhere in the woods. I didn't find it, of course.

I deal with acrylic drums and restoration. Any time a petrolium or ammonia product comes in contact with acrylic, it creates crazing. Looks like that happened to this bezel.
How much should someone expect a servicing to cost?
Wow what a restoration Marshall. Brilliant as always. Can I Ask, did it still safe to make this watch daily beater even with those Geiger Counter number? Please
What a watch. Great work as usual!
Absolutely amazing craftsmanship on a watch worthy of this mechanical-artist and his skill and knowledge.  Brilliant !!!!!!
Love your channel. It's gotten me into old vintage timepieces. Don't have the tools to start working on em yet but I'm getting there. But I got a couple pieces I need to ask you about. I've sent a message on Instagram
All of that gorgeous wrist skin, mmm 😂 for real though, beautiful timepiece.
I really love watching these videos.  I could never attempt anything like this.  All I can say is wow  what an amazing transformation!
That watch is gorgeous. The before and after shots are so dramatic. What a special inheritance. Outstanding work.
Very useful site you made. I think it's a bit outside my budget, but it's already a pretty valuable source of information. Thank you for that.
Someone gave me a North Korean watch, Crazy! It looks nice only the the face no strap the 1800 went off on one of the arms. Would it be restorable!? IDK
Do you do the voiceover after filming or while you work?
Do you ever use a product called Kroil? A penetrating oil. Thanks for sharing.
I was holding my breath when you were prying the bezel off this beauty.  So glad that it came out as well as it did.  Just an amazing transformation.
that is such a beautiful watch, considering it is made in 1958!
What does a restoration like this usually cost? My grandfather's Rolex that he wore in the Korean War is a similar story. I would love to get it running again so I can honor him. Thanks!
Stunning!  Amazing work!
I love your channel. I wish I had better eyesight to start a new hobby. Have you ever done an acutron?  My dad’s 30 year watch from the early 70’s is not running. I had hoped it simply was the battery, but no such luck. I was told Old Father Time was the only source for repair. They want double what it’s worth. My local jeweler suggested that I buy a running watch on eBay and swap cases. What’s your opinion?  Can you recommend any reputable eBay sellers?  Thank you.
Just knowing that this watch was worn and a tool in someone's life, makes it even more special in my eyes. I know that a piece that valuable likely won't ever see use like that again, but golly, I can dream. 😊
1st time seeing one of your videos. Are you the same guy as LGR TECH?
You seem like a really great guy, and I thoroughly enjoy your videos; but you're a watch cleaner, not a restorer. Nekkid Watchmaker has the skill to restore them. Cheers!
Why am I watching this..
Is that crystal plastic?
Amazing tech.
A beautiful old Rolex GMT  that a treasure to own . Well done with the restoration  Thank You.  👍 Au
Nice work.
Beautiful watch and your workmanship was absolutely top notch.
This is a bit of a weird question but does anyone know the name of the type of jar he uses for the solvents like the one dip and isopropyl alcohol?
I have a old Bulova accutron 214 space view. That needs a new battery and possibly a good cleaning. I'd like to discuss these things with you.
I worked in the automotive field for many years and rebuilt many automatic transmissions, but I could never do this.... too complex for me.
Those latex finger gloves look like little condoms ffs 😅
Kudos sir. Job well done
Another masterpiece touched by the master. Nice work!! Love watching your content!
i love these videos , im a mechanical engineer so have an interest, but no real love of watches until i watched a few of your videos . nicely explained easy to listen to and so enjoyable to watch, keep up the good work !!
That was amazing
When you consider that this Rolex watch was made in the early 1950s..How excellent is the craftsmanship and built of this watch?..it explains it's value, which is priceless.. You've revived it to 99.9%..and now it will see many more decades and  you're become part of it's history.
The Radium Girls were female factory workers who contracted radiation poisoning from painting radium dials – watch dials and hands with self-luminous paint. The incidents occurred at three factories in the United States: one in Orange, New Jersey, beginning around 1917; one in Ottawa, Illinois, beginning in the early 1920s; and one in Waterbury, Connecticut, also in the 1920s.  After being told that the paint was harmless, the women in each facility ingested deadly amounts of radium after being instructed to "point" their brushes on their lips in order to give them a fine tip;[1] some also painted their fingernails, faces, and teeth with the glowing substance. The women were instructed to point their brushes in this way because using rags or a water rinse caused them to use more time and material, as the paint was made from powdered radium, zinc sulfide (a phosphor), gum arabic, and water.  Obviously they hadnt learned their lesson by the 50s 😂
un trabajo maravilloso! gran abrazo desde Argentina
I have to agree! That is one beautiful watch. Glad it was repairable and someone will continue to enjoy it!
You interested in reviving a 1963 Omega that belonged to my Grandfather?
Marshall, phenomenal restoration! Just beatififul. I noticed no bezel turn @ the end. I was waiting for the clicks! Precautionary?
Wish you lived around me, your attention to detail is well noted. I would like your opinion if possible about the Rolex Model 16233? This would be my only Rolex that I would buy or could afford. Any useful information would be appreciated.
That crazy pattern on the crystal seems to be more common in older radium luminous watches. I guess the same happens to your dna
I recently fixed a misaligned bezel on a very cheap quartz watch, which involved my first time removing hands - it was quite thrilling and the joy of having successfully fixed it myself is surprisingly intoxicating. I may have to buy some better tools :)
6.3? Not great, not terrible
Any chance you could recommend someone to me to restore my dads rolex submariner? He bought it when he was in vietnam back in the 60’s.
Has anyone ever told you that you’re a master craftsman. So many tiny parts and you remember the location of all- amazing.  I purchased a beautiful ladies Rolex in the 80’s in Switzerland while on a skiing trip. A few years later I dropped and broke the crystal and replaced. Also, had it cleaned  every 2 years.  After about 12 years, I sold for a nice profit, put the money in the stock market and lost it all.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained or not. The owner of this watch had a lucky fine. 😂😮😅
I can nearly rebuild any car engine with my eyes glued shut, and hands tied behind my back.... but watching this blows my mind. No way could I ever get all those tiny pieces back the right way, and make it work again. Bravo.
That was awesome, i was sucked into this repair pretty deep , what a great opportunity. Thanks for showing us.
Breathtaking ❤
Brilliant Marshall!!!
Why didn't you clean it properly, so much gunk still left on, for 100k watch...
I was built in 1958. Can you rebuild me ? I could use it. LoL !
I had an Italian aunt and she gifted me a watch  really really similar to this one and i lost it or I don’t really know if my parents gave it away because i was like 6 or 7
How does the replacement of the crystal affect value? Obviously, it’s awful to look at with the original and the original should always stay with the watch but that topic is not usually addressed. I have an original Seiko 6195-8009 which is all original except for the acrylic which my dad replaced at some point with sapphire. Makes the watch so much more enjoyable to look at and much more durable but I wonder about the value impact. Cheers!
6 Microsievert per hour is quite a lot...
Lovely watch
Thank you for an amazing video
This always seems like a "I won this on at a poker game" vibe.
So amazing talent of doing like this, it's incredible job thanks sir.
That’s a beauty !  Unbelievable, I shed a tear and started to drool 😢    😂
@nicoleonard 😮
My head just hurts watching all those parts, i get really stressed with the complexity of it hoooooly, you have the patience of a monk
Nice, Had me holding my breath!
Im new to this and have been watching for a few days now. Is there a source for buying watches you want to sell?
Beautiful watch and well done restoration as always. I would start the restoration hobby if I did not already have enough other hobbies I was neglecting. lol!  If Washington state had more nights with sunsets like that I would have stayed another 20 years. To much rain for me and too cold for to many nights. 😀
Do you talk the entire time?
I never understood why these watches were so expensive and since I’ve seen the insides, I understand now.   This must have been like black magic prior to batteries. Great content.
I have to pull the bag for rice from the garbage to look at the instructions for the tenth time.
Anyone else suffering from anxiety watching this $100k watch being taken apart?  No way I could get it back together.
AMAZING WORK!!! Man, that was just awesome to watch you work. Beautiful watch too! I just checked out your website. Any thoughts on teaching classes?
What could someone generally expect(fee) for a restoration similar to this?
It’s not a true gmt?
The intro, the freshly trimmed finger nails and the sunset.. you knew this was a special project!!
In my opinion, paying over $200 for a watch is totally irresponsible and stupid.
Surprised you didn't put some solvent around the bezel before removing it.
When they used to paint Radium onto dials (not necessarily at Rolex but for military equipment)before they understood radiation properly the workers would dip their brushes into the Radium paint then lick the end of the brush to bring it to a tip and many of them died from radiation poisoning
I have  a swiss made automatic watch  and recently when I tried to wind it it was very coarse and grabby feeling almost to the point that it felt like at times that it may lock up??
Outstanding!!! Thanks so much for this incredible posting
I’d take a bet the GMT Master was developed for professional divers who spent weeks on end in a diving bell and probably didn’t know what half of the day they were in. Anyone got any other ideas or info on this?
I would normally skip from the beginning to end, the before and after, but I’m so glad I watched the whole video - not just to better understand watch mechanisms, but to also appreciate your craft and skill.
Unreal.  Great work, I really enjoyed watching the transformation!
please stop cutting camera shots every 12 frames. It's not needed and it would be good to just be able to watch single shots for longer
I like your channel and Red Dead Restoration.
Hoping the destroyed crystal would have made its way back. Looked so, perfectly ruined
What an awesome watch!! Great work, it came out amazing!
Gorgeous watch, and superbly considered restoration. I love it!
Excellent restoration!
It's just a watch, the only use for a watch these days is as jewelry and as a status symbol , most people have cell phones which display accurate time,  why carry two devices?
all these videos are made for use to annoy or you accept restorations from everybody!???
SIR. You are a real pro. congratulation. GERRY G. from canada.
Beautiful restoration on this vintage Rolex excellent work I'm sure it takes patience and skills
'Masterful, Marshall' !   Your new moniker !
I hope you get a good cut of the profits - IF the owner decides to sell it!
Suddenly, there is an explosion of new writwatch revival videos. Very happy to see that and thanks for the great videography.
this is a hard working man's watch.
GMT had scraping the dial, hands not polished, bro all you did was take it apart clean and lubricate, change the gaskets, you should have properly restored it
You are an artist and a craftsman.
I hope grandpa didn't pass sad and penniless with all that money in the drawer, first class content.
Excellent video. Thanks for sharing
Call me crazy, but I would have kept that crystal and main spring.  The cracking is perfect and unique and that main spring would have made the watch 100% original. I like originality warts and all.
This is very impressive and now I am at the end of the video I feel I can breath again! Thank you.
Best video you ever made!
❤️🖤
How much do you tighten the screws in a wristwatch? They don’t appear to be torqued to a specific setting. So, can they be overtightened?
How much does a new scratch with steel tweezers affect price.. 6:50..
Love the Damaskeening work.  Now you use carbon fiber sticks and lapping compound to create the overlaps on a X-Y table on a drill press or CNC.  I was able to replicate it on some hunting rifle bolts and slides.  The very early Damaskeening was done by hand with hand shaped sticks and stones(sand slurry).  I was able to order some interior panels for my 1956 Chevy,, with the Hot Rod Damaskeening/jeweling/hand turned/look like they did to the firewalls of the Hot Rods in the 50 and 60's, WW1 and WW2 Fighters, Reno Air Racers, ect.   I have repaired lots of small RC cars and bits, and have had to resort to a stereo microscope for some of that delicate work.  I now use the Stereo Microscope for everything flea sized.  Just makes it so much easier once the magnification is cranked.
Very rough shape.
Far from $70-100k with that dial, luck to reach half!!!
super Masterpiece!
Why would you hide a Ferrari under a barn?
Wow, you are truly amazing. Your skill level is absolutely professional. Thank you so much for a great video.
That’s a beauty
Excellent video and stunning watch. It appears that you are ballparking the torque values of the movement screws. Do the screws simply have no specific torque value? I would find that surprising.
I have restored many watches but a Rolex GMT of this vintage is a scary proposition.  In my opinion you did it correctly and carefully especially not having the resources of a Rolex Certified Watchmaker.  Even though I have done many watches I always learn some new technique from you and that is why I enjoy your chanel so much...thanks.
Is this for sale
All the money in that watch is in the dial and mostly the bezel insert !!!
Bakelite is what they used to make our guitar pickguards with
Love these videos
I'm glad to see the original glow paint was left. The back cover should negate a lot of radiation to the wrist, and people can take more of it than they think without damage.
holy s%%t, this is amazing......!
I feel like I just got to "watch" a Neurosurgeon at work!
I had one of these that I bought for $800 many decades ago. A plastic ROLEX that will give you cancer! Wow I have to pay six figures $ for that! Please!!!
I'd be interested to hear what the customer did with the watch, particularly what it sells for if he auctions it.
Second quarter of 1958
Absorbing to watch that :)
If the owner would need to trade for a kidney..just hit me up..
The crystal on my 1680 did this.  It was a result of acetone damage.
Why not clean the case? still dirt and old gasket on it
My heart rate was up just watching you take the bezel off.
Pepsi dial too
I've never seen such a fascinating, stressful, pins and needles operation as the disassembly of any type of instrument like I've seen in this video. And I worked for Davenport Machine which makes highspeed screw machines.  So satisfying that I had to take a sedative. Luckily I had some Crown Royal handy. 🥵 Thanks for a peek into a whole different world. I'm a timepiece lover myself. 😊
Well done.  The bevel cleaning was actually nerve wracking for me.  Awesome restoration.
Very nice video. I would have liked to see it on your wrist after it was restored. 👍🏽Question: On a 10 year old Marathon GSAR, that has never been serviced, is a new ETA movement any better than having the original movement serviced?
Man whoever gave him this watch to restore, definitely trusted him, that is a pretty rare watch even if it was in bad condition.
Fantastic!
The 6542 and 6538 models are definitely the best looking Rolexes in my opinion.
18 ads later... enjoyed the video, scew youtube for the ads xD
How do you determine which direction to turn the screws to remove them. Looks like some turn one way while others turn the other way
How did it read on the timegrapher afterwards
Amazing video. Thank you
Awesome job.  Unfortunately the dial is not correct for the watch and not sure how it fit.  The dial should be a chapter ring dial and for sure not Superlative Chronometer.
Incredible. Love watching you work; really quite amazing little things, these watches. 🫡
Great job and wonderful skill. Indeed the font on the dial looks pretty much like it was redone at some stage.
I agree with previous comment, perfect, the Bob Ross is watches 👍
Restoration of the year🎉
If this is the holy grail of Rolex watches, then you are certainly the de Troyes. Your modesty would not allow you to make this claim, but you are now part of the recorded history of this fabulous and important timepiece…congratulations, and well done.
🙌🏽👏🏽
Great job!
test
Great job, but I don’t think you mentioned what the jewels were made of
Looks to me like it would be easier to perform a hysterectomy on a flea. I would kinda like to see how those teeny tiny screws and parts are made.
Is this a zenith movement?
My cheap Chinese watch somehow has a capped jewel on the escape wheel lol. The watch is see through and skeletal so I can see all the wheels and gears.      It's really cool that you're helping people get into the hobby. I am unfortunately way too impatient for watchmaking. And too callous. I cannot control my strength sometimes, I'm not usually very strong but sometimes I just accidentally do really crazy things by accident. Like the time we replaced the tap for the sink, it was stuck to the counter with silicon and my father just told me to pull it off as a joke. I uh ripped it right off rather effortlessly. That would go very badly with a watch. Also my hands aren't very stable. As it is, I can barely do soldering.  But it would be nice if I could fix that random watch I have that stopped working.  But for now I guess I'll just stick to messing with my bicycles in the living room.
Nice vid. Missed the bezel turn after you were done. Too many ads.
$100k for an old shitty watch 😂
A-mazing work. Impressive watch and impressive restoration.
I have a Women’s Rolex from 1958. It has those radioactive dial markers too. It’s just in a drawer now. 😢
Can I ask how much you can charge for such a job? thanks! jer
On my second watch through. This is absolutely astounding.
Wow. Best video yet. Thanks for sharing!
I wish I could have seen the face of the guy when he got this back. What a beautiful watch, and an amazing restoration.
Incredible result, I agree with you. It’s a stunning watch.
Would you have any interest in taking a look at a beautiful old calendar (pointer date) moonphase Nacar I am much too scared to open up?  It's not a rare Rolex, but it's extremely complex and challenging!
Anyone else More anxious as he proceeds with the disassembly of a nightmare?
didnt even turn the bezel once smh
The original owner didn't die of cancer by chance did they?
Wow.😊
The watch is worthless because it radioactive unless you make changes to it that destroy its uniqueness. You have to change the dial and the bezel.
I’ve been waiting for some days to have time to watch this without any interruptions, I’m so excited to now watch this.
I have always been mesmerized and fascinated with the ornate engineering that goes into the watch movements. My tiny brain can't concieve nor understand how they were made in the 17 century.
That radium stuff was super scary stuff. The girls that would apply this stuff in factories would dip their paintbrushes into the radium paint, and paint the indices and numbers on dials of watches and clocks. Between coats they’d use their lips to straighten the bristles on the brush. This caused thousands of women to get mouth and other cancers. They’re now known as Radium Girls. Wikipedia and YouTube has some great articles on them
how the hell do you know where all the bits go back....lol
Just epic!
Ok so I understand that the “wheels” and everything inside the watch is perfectly cleaned and functioning great now plus it has a new crystal. But the dial, the hands, the date, and the bezel still look like crap though……
Wonderful
Why not clean all the crud off the back?
I’m thankful to the owner of this watch for asking you to perform the service and cleaning of this amazing treasure! Thank you Marshall for sharing this experience with us. Your honest conversational tone is really inviting and puts your viewers at ease so we can enjoy your expertise.
How do you insure these things when you ship them out
Love the genuine enthusiasm ❤❤❤
Nothing is worth $100,000 on a wrist watch.
give your speedy a service. Its time for some more complex compilations
Skills !!!
1000 CPM, not great, not terrible
Marshal is the mannnnnnn,awesome job,great video like always...!
👍      ⌚
Why is this video more exciting than any modern action movie?
I would have kept the original glass i liked the effect and story it would have had ⌚⌚⌚⌚⌚⌚⌚
Amazing effort ~ !
We seen these gorgeous real worn old watches on some channels and to see you actually work on one is just epic, thanks, amazing video
What makes a Rolex so expensive?
That’s so true to is how he knows where everything went back. Just like a engine tear down or a plane. This man is a professional and it takes years to be the best I’m sure he was doing this as a kid. Taking all kinds of watches apart n putting them back. Do u wind this watch everyday or not. Good good job sir. Always wondered when I brought my watches to be fixed how they did such a job. Now I don’t he is a watch smith.
I'm thinking this watch may not have been put in a drawer when stopped. For the watch it is and how it looks I feel it may have been put on a night stand or something and possibly have sat in the sun for some of each day as it passed. Would definitely account for the pattern of cracking on the crystal and would also explain the lubrication loss of the oils inside the watch. Thank you so much for sharing, you are definitely inspiring me to give matchmaking a go.
Is this the most expensive watch in the world. Or is there the crem ala crem version of a watch that’s worth millions.
Three or four large pieces get put in a case and moved far away from the work area.  All the tiny pieces just scattered willy nilly inches away from the active work area.  🤔  Can see the watch running at various points starting at 9:05
Hi Marshal i love your videos!!! I am from mexico and live in NYC, I have a question for you, my dad inherited from a brother of his a very old non working rolex bubbleback very very old in which the movement is all f’d up. He tried to do something on it in mexico but no one could do anything to fix this beautiful watch. Since I moved to new york and have had a couple of watchmakers review it and some said it has no fix, others told me it needs a complete new movement or other had said can fix it but a crazy expensive rate! And i really want it to be in shape and working so he can finally use it! So i wanted to know if you just receive pieces or how much do you charge for analyzing it or what is your business model! Let me know please!!!!
If you're not familiar, look up the radium girls, and what they went through painting those watches. We covered it in xray school and it's pretty fascinating.
Watching this I see that Marshall has real trust issues... with springs!!! Beauty of a watch and a pleasure to see it restored.
Wow.  My 30 y.o. Rolex, that I have worn 2 times must be worth $50K.  A large clunky heavy weight.  Another of life's mistakes.  I think I can find it.
That original crystal was some kind of plastic? Acrylic or polycarb? If so, that looks a lot like crazing, which can happen if acrylic gets cleaned with windex.
Sorry to say this, but the Asians that do watch restorations make the watches look new again. They would of at least cleaned it much better
The crystal did that from humidity and heat. I've seen this happen on watches in the past. chances are they had it in a draw next to a fireplace or heater. it takes a long time to get like that though a lot of hot and cold.
Awesome !
Job well done.
PS You can polish Bakelite gently with chrome polish, it also oils it to prevent cracks
I can only imagine how much fun would you have restoring vintage Patek Philippe Grand Complications :)
Have to admit, gmt is not my cup of tea, but this. is other level
I really admired your outstanding work on this marvelous jewel. Fantastic restoration. My very best compliments.
What an absolute beauty ! That watch is just drop dead gorgeous,serviced by a very special watchmaker. I wish that the GMT was mine,simply stunning.Great work Marshall.
Nice to see you again 😊
It's mind-blowing to me how overrated Rolex watches are
Love your videos. You did get me into watchmaking. It’s very fun!   P.s. does the bezel turn on this watch now that you cleaned it up!?
So glad that watch went to you for the care and attention it deserved!
Congrats!
9:00 - that watch is running ! also, how fragile is that Bakelite, given the watch had seen that much use and it was in good condition?
Still can’t believe that I can watch all of your videos for free. Thank you, Marshall!
These restoration videos are so relaxing ❤. Super nice watch. Great work
Your best upload to date, absolutely amazing work on a truly beautiful piece.
Where did you get that crystal? I know rolex is real anal about selling crystals cause of the fakes out there.

Hi Marshall, once again a great video so engaging. I've been following you from the start and took your advice and did Mark’s course spent a lot of money on tools etc and unfortunately I now have arthritis which has limited my ability to carry on but I still follow you avidly you do make the hobby look enjoyable and have checked out your new website and wish you all the best in this endeavor you really do deserve this, I'm based in the UK so I'm lucky that I've had next day delivery access from the likes of Cousins and Gleave's. Which I know you found very time consuming. Let alone the cost of shipping. So, I think. Your website. Will give access to a whole new. Group of followers. And your enthusiasm Is contagious. Good luck.
The amount of self esteem you have to work on this 😊 well done mate!
I wonder if the crystal's condition is in any way a product of the radioactivity.
Only one problem. Reprint the reserved list!!! Hear hear!!!
Magnificent. Just magnificent. Thank you so much for sharing with us!
Dude. You are just amazing
Wonderful video. Will you please do a video over your dornbluth & Sohn?
I wish I had a rolex.
Wow I’m really looking forward to watching this one.  Thanks Marshal for keeping us so entertained
Great restoration on nice timepiece
Was that James White the Christian theologian and scholar on your patron list!?
Would it be worth a call to Rolex to see if they would pay?
You’re calling them gears they’re actually called cogs a mechanical term is called a cog I do appreciate and love watching you show me how to fix a Rolex watch. I have quite a few watches that I can’t even get fixed but I just like watching how people do mechanical stuff keep up the good work
I'm not watch guy but I do love all the special tools you use.
Wow.... no words.
I love the magic playmat!!
Beautiful watch but what about the radiation?
You've worked on a lot of really cool watches with wonderful stories, but there was something very affecting to me about seeing this watch - so old, so gunked up - running a little bit even before being worked on, only after freeing it up some. It's clearly a survivor, and a treasure of workmanship.   It's so interesting that the dial might have been refinished. It looked awfully good compared to the other parts but I thought it might be just lucky. I like to hear about your connections to the industry and community too.
Epic video!!!!
top 5 retail rolex of all time
Outrageous skill
Your channel came across my FYP on TikTok so I looked u up on YouTube because of this video and wow so informative and just definitely passionate about your craft well done sir
Can you please type the name of the website you mentioned in 42:00
beautiful watch and a great job in the restoration
Why do they install a device that makes clicks? What is the purpose other than just making click noises?
The scratch with the screwdriver @ 18:35... ouch!
Nice watch....  I have the modern day equivalent (Apple watch with the GMT face).  Although I can say its not near worth as much!  🤠👍
You’re doing pretty good when Cartier puts a watch ad in the middle of your video.
Could you, kind sir, show us a wide view of your table camera setup? Perhaps the kind of cameras you use? I watch your channel and enjoy it immensely as it stops my panic attacks. Thank you very much for your channel.
Sir...as always an amazing job!
Man I got cold chills when you snapped that bezel on.  Wow!!!!!
Damn The Torpedoes!!   FULL AHEAD!!
Could the radiation from the dial have caused that crazing in the crystal?
Wow! Great job you made it look brand new 👏 ❤
Awesome video. I had a thought as you were jump cutting between the before and after that it would be cool to see the before and after side by side from the same camera angles simultaneously. Cheers and looking forward to future videos.
Amazing!  Great work..beautiful piece!
Wow 🤩 that is some awesome restauration of an extremely expensive and rare 1958 Rolex!! You my friend are the “Master GMT” of watch repairs 😂 seriously great job Marshall 👍🏼 ✌🏼😎👍🏼
such anxiety watching you take out those parts and putting them back!
Incredible watch! ❤
Nice Job on the watch. I am sure the owner will be ecstatic when they get the watch back. I love the Rolex brand. I only own one, but I love it. I own the 126600-1 oyster date model produced in 2021 and I wear it daily.  I also own the Omega planet ocean 8500 series watch. They are both great time pieces.  Great work on the watch.
My god,so many parts in that watch... who was the bored psychopath that designed the first watch with all that in there lol wow that's amazing
Acrylic yacht hatches get the same crazing from excessive UV exposure. He must have lived in the sun!
Great restoration! .....What about the radiation, sir?
I'd suspect one of two things as the reason the crystal looks like that.  I've seen plastics deteriorate like that from exposure to strong solvents.  Acetone, MEK, things of that nature.    It could also be caused by 70 years of bombardment by radium radiation and exposure to radon gas.
That original crown was not stripped, that o-ring gasket did not belong inside the crown and was causing the crown to be unable to catch the case tube threads. I bet if you had removed that gasket and tried again it would have threaded perfectly. Rolex of that era only used two rubber o-rings and it was for  the inside of the crown tube and for the caseback.
Imagine my surprise at 42:00.
Great job Marshal! With the bezel was the lume somehow fused with the bakelite? I was worried the it would just wash away the same way it would fi radium hands were washed in water and soap.  Stunning watch!!
Nice video!!
With a non-quick set calendar, instead of going 24 hours to advance it, is there any reason you can’t just go back and forth between 9:00 pm or so and midnight to make it click ahead?
great work.
39:33 is a tooth brush even too abrasive for a date wheel or dial face or the bezel?  Edit: ope, shoulda held my question. You used a toothbrush later lol
36:40 almost like bitumen. Or straight up la brea tar pits!
27:47 the crown looks ENORMOUS compared to the rest of the watch lol. Really shows how small the gears are as I know how big a crown is!
12:13 I wonder if the crystal cracked like that just from being in an attic or something and the temperature swings and it's just split from expanding and shrinking for 40 years
Not just the radium is a problem with the bezel here. Bakelite contains Asbestos!
Rolex was not replacing the Bakelite bezels because of their fragility, it was due to the fact that the radiation the watches gave off with the luminous bezel inserts surpassed what was legally allowed by the US government, so Rolex could not legally send those watches back to customers with the original radium inserts.
Let me know if you’re interested in servicing a Grand Seiko Spring Drive.  Mine’s due for service in the next couple years.
Gosh that's gorgeous. Nice job.
Rodico isn't Silly Putty, it's Serious Putty.
I was at full pucker when you were removing and reinstalling that bezel. Great job.
I am not an expert on radiation but wouldn't it be pretty dangerous to wear a watch that emits 6 mSv/h?
If I die and go to hell, I'll be painting houses, unscrewing flat-head screws, watching women's basketball and having to put together watches.
I. Love. Your. Content. I want to be you when I grow up.   Seriously, thanks so much for this channel, it’s a watch lovers dream. Incredible production quality, and that GMT is truly stunning. Crisp and elegant dial through the new crystal, and service revealed a solid movement meant to last.  The movement is also beautiful. That’s the first Rolex I’ve actually loved.
Just a thought:  perhaps the shape of the original crystal (very unique) was the direct result of the radioactive lime in the bezel and the face.
Unbelievable is an understatement. The best of the best. Both the watch and the craftsmanship of the service/repair. Thanks so much for posting up!!
I have a 16710 and there’s a hell of a difference 👍👍❤️
Amazing work as always, Marshall.  I love these old GMTs, not just the Rolexes but the Zodiacs, Heuer Autavias, etc.
Wow, I really enjoyed this one ...
I think you doubled the value of this watch.  Thanks for sharing!
Hi, I love your channel and the work you do. I was told that GMT watches were designed and made by Rolex for Pan American Airlines because the (at the time) new Boeing 707 passenger aircraft were the first that could fly non-stop from New York to London. This meant that the pilot had to know the time in both cities simultaniously. GMT stands for Greenwich Mean Time.
So satisfying to watch this on a watch that most could only dream of seeing in person let alone to be able to get as intimate as you were able!
Wow.. what a beautiful watch.. !
Nicely done. I wait for Marshall to say "keyless works" then I'm happy!
Outstanding work 🎉❤
These are so good! Thank you.
🫡👍🇸🇪
Wearing your own vintage Pepsi at 25:16 - respect 🙂
And that is absolutely not beautiful that's absolutely dog trash, but if he gets paid to restore dog turds good for him
Absolutely stunning watch — and such a pleasure to watch a master craftsman work on it.
Absolutely incredible. Very nice work.
$100,000 for that. That is trash. Just push the middle class out...ridiculous trash lol
The radon gas emission is tiny.  You are correct about ingesting or inhaling the lume dust.  Radium is a "bone seeker" that chemically can become part of the bone in your body and there is a small potential for bone cancer or other cancers in about 15 to 30 years after exposure.  Many of the "radium girls" from the early 1900s suffered from acute exposures.
No offence I love your videos but this watch is so rare and expensive why would he not take it to Rolex to do a factory restoration?
All your videos are amazing but this may be my favourite! Congrats!
You made my night.  Well done!
Maybe an odd question on this channel but please hear me out.   Last week, after a long time saving up. I finally got to pick up my new nomos tangente with date and gangreserve indicator.   As I was setting the time and date, I noticed the date didn’t work.   The watch had been send back to the factory. But is it bad? Like can I trust a watch that has been fixed after something like this. It’s like my first mechanical watch and like 3k….
You talk about the value of the watch, how much would it have cost if the owner sent this to Rolex to be fixed and maintained?
Great find! But it's not worth 100k with the service dial and hands. The original insert, on the other hand, appears to be genuine; that alone is like 25k.
Congratulations!
What precautions did you take to protect yourself against the radioactive bits? Isn't the watch a hazard in general? I've read that they used Strontium 90, not Radium, which ... is worse??
Endlessly fascinating channel.   No idea how he can keep his hands steady enough to work with these tiny parts.  So cool!
Beautiful patina.
The best video yet! 👍and I’ve watched a lot of them. Nice work fella
The reason the crystal is crazed like it is might be due to insect repellent. I’ve ruined a couple of watch crystals due to very strong insect repellents.
Tremendous watch and episode Marshal, I was lucky enough to get the new equivalent a few months ago so this is a special episode for me. Your channel just keeps getting better and I’m considering starting a wee hobby doing similar. I’ll be sure to check out your website. 🙏
Very curious to know what you did with the balance wheel and spring? you didn't show anything about them.
I just have experience watch envy!
When you said "...crazy pattern of cracking...", regarding the crystal, that's what had occurred - crazing ... that's crazy !
Not 100k may be 25k 30k
Your videos are riveting lol !
That was amazing!  Good Job Marshal!  Thanks for Sharing you hobby with us.
Wow super watch restoration! Do you plan to service any chronograph watches for your channel?
I have no interest in watches whatsoever. However, I love watching these videos and seeing these precision instruments being lovingly brought back to life. Very relaxing. Kind of like the joy of painting. 😂
Wow!  What a great video.  Thanks for sharing
Your commentary is enjoyable and my favorite part of the whole video.
Honestly, I'd keep that old crystal just to mess with. It looks sweet
I so enjoy your videos but Youtube is ruining it with too many ads-- just saying
Thanks for another FANTASTIC video!   It's great that the watch was worn and used well for decades and that you were able to get it ready to be back in the saddle as it were.
That’s awesome
I never knew why the Mercedes shape had a purpose. That’s cool.
.366 roentgen. Not great, not terrible lol
Very cool and well done. A question i have, do you mark the date when you service your watches, i have seen on some of my pocket watches that they will inscribe in the case the last service. Many thanks for your videos.   Chris
Insane that watch was running at 9:04 , so amazing
how did all the plating on the inside of this watch get worn off? It looks like someone took sandpaper to it!  The pearlage is scratched off. What parts are rubbing against the watch on the inside?
That's cool! Didn't expect to see this one, with the bakelite even!!
Great looking time piece!
The restoration itself is a work of art! Thanks for sharing!
Oh my god!
I'm surprised it made it through the USPS/UPS when it puts out more radiation than a smoke detectors.
Te pongo NO like porque solo hiciste restauración del mecanismo y ese reloj merece una restauración completa. No me gustan los trabajos incompletos.
You are the best! Wonderful video and sublime restoration! Super!
Excellent video!
Beautiful job !!
spectacular restoration!!!!!
Do you think “crystal” cracking could be due to radiation?
Marshall, thank you for these videos. I've been watching you for probably a year+ now and am slowly accumulating the tools to make this a hobby. I have my father's 1963 vintage Rolex that I want to service, but I'm going to get some "scrap" watches to practice on before I attempt it.
what was your total "time invested"?
Marshall, Nice job and Thank you for bringing this excellent video to us! It’s the first I’ve seen on a detailed service of the old 1030 series movements. One FYI; the II 1958 on case back is 2nd qtr 1958, not month. You’ll never see anything higher than IV.
seems that you have 'respect' or feeling the honour of working a kind of "Rolex Grail"... nice to be able to join the journey, and so nice to see that the watch had held up to "everyday use" so well.
Rolex after service would have thrown away half the components, including the hands and dial
you can tell the owner : "well its unfixable .. everything inside is rusted out, the restoration would be just impossible... I can give you 2000$ for it? "
Awesome piece of history.  Spellbound the whole way along!
I loved watching you work on the GMT. I used to sell them back in the 70s and 80s along with the whole Rolex line. But, a cloth strap on a Speedmaster? 😊
what a job! thanks for sharing this! very very nice job on this piece!
Danke!
That crystal looks like photodegradation. Maybe the owner was a driver, fisher, or it just sat in a window sil for too long?
im curious, do you record the voice-over as you do the watch or do you edit the footage first then comment over it?
Bro I would be nervous just touching bakelight - worth its weight in gold and then some
👏👏👏
Your best ever, just incredible. I suspect you’re  going sell a lot of tools. I’d love to see you author a book for beginners, or a video course… or do you already have those? Thanks.
Hi Marshall, great watch and great work. It makes me very curious on seeing you working on a more modern mainstream movement like a NH35A from Seiko. What would be the differences. How ist it possible to have all this technique today in a movement that costs less than 50€. I think there are many differences and I would love to see a comparison.
is the amount of radiation still safe to work with?
You are an amazing talent
NICE JOB
That’s a nice one omg!
I typically love watching these, but this camera angle jumps around from waaaaayyyyy too much!
Great video as always. In the future I'd like to hear more details about the special treatment you give watches which contain Radium. You mentioned you have to be very careful because it's radioactive, but then there wasn't any further detail about what exactly that means, and, as far as I could tell from watching the video you were wearing your usual finger cots and using the usual tools and process, so what exactly did you do differently to be carefully with the Radium. Also, is wearing this watch after restoration an exposure risk?
Amazing work
Thank you for this great video . Amazing work .
I am here just by random algorithm suggestion... but is the GMT hand not touching the dial??
How did the accuracy turn out?
Fascinating as usual, wish I can get hold of you, have an old omega seamaster that has a broken hair spring was also messed up with so called watch maker now just sitting, you are welcome to it.
that finished watch is absolutely gorgeous, great job refurbishing it
The way the original crystal cracked around the date bubble, it looks like the plastic was damaged by heat. I'd think just sunlight would've yellowed it more and it doesn't seem to have that, but it does seems like the watch has been somewhere that enough of a heat source was extremely close by for a long enough span of time, and led to premature deterioration of the material. I could be wholly mistaken, but the 'organicness' of the cracks don't seem derived from a fall or impact.
Hey Marshall, I may have a solution or a stupid idea for your ever-so-dangerous yoke spring problem. Have you considered a small plexiglas box with O or U shaped cutouts for your hands? The reason I ask is because at my former job I have designed and built quite a few of these protective plexiglas cases for a major client of ours. The client had a automotive cable manufacturing plant, and the line workers had to be safe of potential flying debris from the assembly line. If you are interested, reach out and I'll design you a protective box in minutes :)
I oddly love seeing the wear automatic rotors put on the edges of the main plate and the bridges of the watches I work on. Shows the history of just how long the watch was on someone's wrist.
Seems like you have gained not just so much respect,  from the many that view your revivals, but the trust and confidence in your workmanship to be honored with this watch is amazing.
The Bakelite bezel creates a question. Marshal said the watch is from 1958. Rolex reference sites note the Bakelite bezel was dropped soon after the first year of production. A few reference sources say all Bakelite bezels were recalled due to radiation. (I wonder how effective a recall worked for customer watches out of Rolex control.) As noted, the dial isn't original, and lacks the Swiss identifier.
I am trying to get it, but, I don't get it what the hype of this, it nice watch, but not $100-200k
That Omega has 0 radioactive material in it. The 11 you measured on the Geiger Counter was background radiation. Try measuring a Banana and you'll get a higher count.
I don't feel those essentials tool kit are good value on your website, $50 loupe $10 tweezers and $100 screwdrivers don't add up to $500 sure I want to support ya but that seems like a misprint.
Marshall, love the vids! Your skill and narration are an inspiration to me. So much so that I took up horology pursuits and am working on watches. You also inspired me to find a non working cannon pinion remover and have the confidence to attempt to fix it, which I did. Please keep doing "your thing" as you inspire people from around the world. I am in Australia.
I have a Germasian watch, Trias, that won't run. It's my first automatic and I've had it for a number of years. I am planning to disassemble it to see what happened to it. What do I have to lose?
So brave working on such an iconic Rolex. It looks beautiful. Well done!!
Because the dial and hands have been replaced, it’s value is more along the lines of $10,000 - $20,000.
One sneeze....and I be looking for missing parts on carpet floor, lol.
I have a vintage Rolex Oyster Precision - not the most interesting of watches, but it was a gift from a special friend when I left a rehab center. But two people have refused to repair it, it's the winder that's broken - because of the radium. It sits in a draw now and I miss it.
I have always wanted to do something like what you're doing with the watches and/or jewelry. But my eyes are way too bad. But I do have a question. Have you ever had a watch that you've got all done? And it worked, but you had extra  parts.
Brilliant work Marshall, stunning watch
I need a little more confidence before starting this. And also i think i need some extra tools....in Romania its kinda hard to find propper tools.
👍😊💥
What did the grandpa die of? Prob  got exposed to some extra radiation 😂
Lovely job, the Bakelite bezels are so so rare to find intact. It’s probably half the value of the watch in itself. As you say later it’s a service dial, there’s no chapter ring and the lume is clearly tritium which is a shame, but it’s an absolutely wonderful piece.
Beautiful watch.
Hi Marshall, thanks for a fascinating video on a beautiful watch. I would agree with you that the dial is a replacement and not original -- note that there is no 'SWISS' at the bottom, no printed circle around the circumference, and the font is definitely dodgy. Just in case you didn't know, the 'II.1958' stamped inside the caseback doesn't refer to November of that year, but to the second quarter of the year (in Roman numerals). Thus you may see I, II, III or IV followed by the year. In later models the year is given in two figures only (e.g. II.68).
What an absolutely beautiful watch, and a fantastic restoration as always.
been watching you for ages, just realized you use an MTG playmat on the side.
Stunning ❤
At 51:43, why do the hour hand and alternate time zone hand not rotate the same amount while you are setting the time?
Really enjoyed this one.
I sure enjoy this channel. The transformation on this GMT really stands out and shows why those darn things are worth so much money
Easily your best video yet!
You popped the bezel back on I was like oh!!
I have lived for many years now and the reason i say this, because in my whole life i have never seen a watch that is so beautiful as this timeless Rolex. Yes it was made long ago but it is absolutely stunning in every way. Kudos to you man for a top class restoration and i am envious of the lucky person that owns it.
@ 32:50 what does that setting thing do? The one with the plus and minus?   Is it the speed at which the watch is going?
Wow!
Marshall, this is really masterful work. If you hadn't mentioned the heightened caution and anxiety you felt in your voiceover, one would never be able to tell it from watching you work. Working on such an important watch, and an example as remarkable as this "desk find", you approached it with the calm professionalism your channel exemplifies. For example, I held my breath and my heart was pounding when you removed the bezel, but I knew deep down that you were using the safest method reasonably available to you. Therefore, I was overjoyed and happily unsurprised when it dropped out intact. Simply incredible restoration.
Thank you for this beautiful interesting video. Greetings from Croatia!
I am curious about the radiation and its affects? Would the person wearing this for extended periods of time get affected by it in any way?
Oh my lord what a beautiful watch well done yet again.
it seems that you didn't clean the dial. there is dirt and sports on the Radium portion of the dial. would appreciate if you did.
Was the gasket in the crown causing the screw down problem? I believe those were flat...
I bet that bezel got like that from the sun.  If you sit left seat(captain) in a airliner your left arm would be in the sun a lot.
Wow, that crystal is WRECKED. I'm not an expert, but that crack pattern looks like pressure damage to me. I'd be willing to bet that the watch got squished at some point. Stepped on, maybe, or something similar. I've seen acrylic panels with similar patterns of damage after being bent past the point of failure.
950 cpm. Not great not terrible
as a watch lover and beginner tiinkerer wow what an excellent job, and wow!! could you imagine this amazing piece in your watchbox? and just curious how much does a service like that run now days vs how much it would cost back in the 1950 s to perform the same restoration
@nicoleonard might like this video
“Bakelite has awesome properties “ - Marshall ca. as soon as it turned to dust...
⌚️🤎🙌
Just curious, is your voice track live as you record or added in post?
Marshall, What did he say when he got the watch back??? IT is a beauty, the patina is like old furniture, leave it alone. Cheers, Rik Spector
goddamn imagine realizing gramps left you a 6 figure, radioactive watch
Well done and congratulations! A piece for the history books.. my nerves were shot when reinstalling the time ring.. did you breath at all during that restoration? 🤣
Amazing video! I was worried you damaged the lume on the dial when taking it off and flipping and my heart skipped haha
I bet it was put in a drawer when the bracelet broke.
Couldn't you have used alcohol to clean the bezel area?  The numbers are still dirty and the underside as well.
It's fucking beautiful man great job. I'm not a watch guy at all but love it videos man keep it up!!
Did you really film this over a year ago in 2022? :D
Wow... that thing is *hot*, and I mean radiation!  I wonder if that's what crazed the crystal.  Good job.
Well, Happy Thanksgiving to me!  A Wristwatch Revival episode to watch after the days festivities are over!  Marshall, I remember watching your "First Rolex" episode, and now look at you,  working on a 100K model.  Well done, sir!
Looks like heat stress on the crystal..great video!..Thanksgiving matinee!…lol
In many vintage Rolexes why most of the time, there is always a scratch mark at the hands? Its weird because many are in condition in never been service which means the watch has never been opened before, but scratch mark on the hand is always there .
I remember reading and watching the stories about the painting of these old watches with radium, nice piece of history
mmmmhhh ooouuh aaaahh. I don't know what to say. That is a Ferrari 250 GTO of watches...
What precautions did you take in regards to the radium?  Special PPE or ventilation?
Marshall easily sliding past reference points as the GMT youtube video I watch when I want to dream.
Great to see another old watch back in working order. Not a fan of Rolex but one like this would be desirable thanks for posting.
Amazing!
1st time here. Very nice work.  Well done.
Marshal I love ya, but I wish you would have taken the scratches off that case.
I'd argue that your video adds to the value of this watch. The current or future owner now have a well documented servicing of this piece of history and this video is part of its historical record.
After your interview. Myself wait for bedtime so do not have interrupts or outside noise.  I can really get onto details.  Learned a lot.
I wonder if the original owner was a Pan Am pilot when he got the watch.
No one noticed at 9:00 the watch starting running?!
Fantastic restoration! I love these vintage units. Can you please tell me how different this movement is compared to the modern day Rolex movements. Are the new ones in any way more superior, and has the technology changed that much? Thank you
Drawer Find is the watch equivalent that Barn Find is to Cars
Hi Marshall, I went to your website to see if I could afford an entry level or beginners kit. I can afford both the essentials kit and entry level kit, however, the essentials kit doesn't get me the tools I feel like I NEED to start out as a beginner; like tools to open the watch or to hold the watch/ movement while working on it, which I would assume is essential to working on a watch. I'd love to get into watch making but all the "watch repair" kits I can find are leagues out of my price range, or they're absolutely garbage quality directly from China.  Would you consider a starters kit, an in between kit of entry level and essentials, combining entry level drivers, loupe(s), tweezer(s) a holder and caseback ball/knife with a price between essentials and entry level?
I feel like it looked better before tbh had more character.
That was a treat. Thanks.
Amazing piece
Something I've been curious about, are you recording your audio as you are working or doing voice over after?
Beautiful watch and great work! I did notice it looks like the rotor had been dragging on the base plate. Were you able to do anything about the wobble from the rotor causing that?
Marshall, I've seen every single one of your videos, and I think this is the best one ever. Love this watch, and I really enjoyed your commentary. The only thing I would change is that I would have loved to see you rotate that bezel for us. Can you confirm whether it rotated freely after the repair?  Thanks very much!
As usual - absolute perfection! Is the level of radiation emitted by this watch not going to be harmful to the wearer though?
Excellent episode. What an amazing restoration of a beautiful Rolex. Great history 👍🏻 you do beautiful work 🙂
And in 1958, it was actually reasonably priced.
WOW! This might be your masterpiece! What a beautiful watch! Great job!
Holy. Crap.
You made me remember the "Radium Girls" story when you were talking about the bezel.
How can I get you to fix a watch?
Excellent episode.  The 6542 is also one of my favorites.   Great job on the service.  You are very skilled.   A few observations.  The watch does look like it was serviced at some time , however they did not date it on the inside case back .  It must have been a private watchmaker and not rolex as they would have surely replaced the insert after they had issued a recall on those inserts because of the radiation and fragility   Mr Shear was correct, the dial was defiantly refinished some time ago.   I can tell it was refinished other than a service item because it lacks the swiss markings at the 6oclock.  The original would have had a negative relief gilt glossy dial  The crown was replaced. Original would have been a 6mm brevet + crown  date wheel replaced - should be a roulette date wheel. And not champagne coloured   A fine specimen.    Rather amazing that his grand dad wore it soo much and the insert remained in one piece!!   Thank you for sharing your experience with us.   It was very enjoyable to watch.
Great job man 👍
Scrounging monies on lolcow prateon
How much do you charge for this job ?
His voice over is stupid.  Making out his talking while destroying the ROLEX
So beautiful! GMT is also my favorite. I’ve owned two of them. One vintage
it looks like its worth $10 dollars now🤣😂 applewatch is way better
Stunning watch, my brother bought a new Rolex in the 70s and sold it a few years later, i bet he regrets that now.
The P Galore
I do think u are beyond just a hobbyist. Fascinating  work.
Beautiful watch,thanks for sharing this amazing revival.
A GMT Master is my holy grail.  One day I shall have one
Well done, Marshall.
That was great!
Can you explain amplitude when it comes to watches? Is it the intensity of the “tick”
at 18:34??? Did the automatic winding plate get scratched?
I've always thought learning to work on watches would be a great hobby.  I have a very strong attention to detail but I have no patience for many things.  I'd probably just lose my cool too often working on one of these to the point it wouldn't be any fun.  That's why I watch you restore/repair watches.  I live vicariously through your videos ;-).
Holy shit.
I bet you always won when you played Operation as a child?
3 minutes into the video and we got a watch that isnt running, doesnt open, bezel wont move, cracked to pieces, and lumed with enough radium to kill a horse. Now this is going to be interesting.
So glad you started up a business to help people interested in watch disassembly and maintenance!!! These videos are an inspiration.
Very cool vlog. I’m also a watch nerd. 👍
Anyone know; Does the Radium from the outside of the watch break down the oils and lubricants in the watch in a different way than what just time would?
This watch is absolutely 🔥🔥🔥. Another great restoration!
Incredible work.
Do you think the long term exposure to the radium radiation caused or contributed to the cracking and crazing of the crystal!
What a perfect 65th birthday present for that watch.
Can we see if available the drawings that watches are designed upon.
you remind me while you worked on this watch of a movie .where theres a complex bomb with hundreds of wires and some bomb pro is sweating with some wire cutters to try to defuse it lol.never owned a rist watch but amazed at how someone invented it. and you can take it apart and fix it.hats off to you sir.
I guess the term "wheel" came from the word "cogwheel". That is another way you call a gear.  Also, good news. I found another watchmaker in my little town who have a spare balance wheel + spring and I got my cheap pocket watch repaired! I've never been so happy in my life!
...The crystal looks more like it's just degraded from age; acrylic will get brittle, go yellow, and just crack of its own accord like that. Same kind of thing can happen on old oil-level sight-glasses on vintage machine tools.
You video stress me 😂
If I can't own one of these watches, my end goal is to at least learn about it and work my way towards starting a hobby like this. I love all of these videos, and I watch every minute of them. Absolutely awesome!
Man what a beautiful watch! Just incredible that you got to restore a piece of history. Well done!
great video! Also what an excellent idea for a website; just an FYI the "entry-level kit" page is 404'ing. Thanks again for all the Magic and watch content!
Oh My... what a beauty..and what a beautiful restoration on that classic GMT. Makes your mouth water. Excellent job on that work, Marshall...a lot of history there for sure.  Kudos to you.
Not absolutely shaw, but if i have remembered correctly, Rolex  used Zenith movements  for a lot of their watches  up until the late 90s
Hey Marshall, the original crystal wasn't smashed it was 'crazed', typically caused by heat, UV and/or solvents.   Keep up the good work.
First time ever watching a watch rebuild.  Super cool.
Wow Marshall, this is the most incredible watch Ive seen you do so far. What a piece of history! Thank you for bringing us this one and as always incredible job.  You have the best shots and narration of any youtube watchmaker channel. Hats off to you. As a GMT Master II owner my favorite video of yours was the Pepsi that you restored for a family member of a man who used to garden and do construction with his and it was full of dirt. This one is my new favorite!
Okay Marshall. What did grandpa die from?
That cracking on the crystal could be from the radium emitting from the dial,braking down the lens meterial.
It's a really beautiful watch. Is that one of them strontium 90 bezels that Rolex recalled for safety reasons? That would scare me! The 'mercedes hand' is actually an already existing thing, so luckily Mercedes couldn't trademark it.
Man I have to say that you are like a modern Bob Ross in a way. I'm so digging these videos. Thank you so much for your work!
Great video !   I notice after the cleaning some parts are still yellowed from the patina.  I guess that would be hard to remove? I also notice that the hairspring is blue.  Did Rolex "blued" their harisprings back in the midcentury for strength?
I very much enjoy watching your videos, but find it deeply annoying that there are so many adverts and often having to sit through the entire episode.
Radium! If anyone wants some delicious nightmare fuel, look up what happened to the girls who were paid starvation wages to paint the radium on watch faces and hands back in the early 20th century. They were taught to keep the brush tip as fine as possible by shaping it with their lips.
To think man hadn't landed on the moon yet when this watch was built.
Thanks!
I myself am very interested in the watch making and repair. You should do a complete "how to" or introduction to watchmaking series!
amazing watch, amazing master. thanks for video...
41:41 If I may…., respectfully….. what you’re talking about is  correctly referred to as “Typeface”. Not “font”. Typeface is a design. Font is an actual pie rod tooling a printer uses to set typeface in the printing process.  Sorry. It’s a peeve of mine that I see over and over again.
Incredible!
The website is great! I am in IT (telecom/unified communications) and am very attracted to a hobby that can live on my desk in between calls.
You have a gift Sir!  To understand and completely visualize the disassemble and assemble is amazing .  Thank You so much for sharing your amazing talent !!!
Great video! What a sweet watch
I would love to learn how to repair watches. But so many little pieces. How do you remember were they all go?
I notice when setting in and tightening these tiny screws that you don’t seem to begin by turning them counter clockwise to insure the threads are properly set. Apparently they go in just fine for you. But I for one thought doing so would be absolutely necessary, particularly with such small screws. You don’t seem the least bit concerned. Why is that?
My dream watch! Lucky you.
9:19 "Hands-on hobbies" as you remove the hands from the watch. I see what you did there.
👏🏻👏🏻👍
That is an extrodinary watch. What a pleasure to see the full restoration and the work involved.
Radium mostly emits alpha and beta radiation which doesn't travel far or penetrate far. Maybe hazardous if ingested. Not much to worry about.
Very cool watch, well done. Thanks
So, drinking coffee would not be a good thing?  😳
Marshall, I have a vintage Rolex for you to restore. Please reach out.
After watching a number of your videos, I've now taken up the hobby of watch repair. Simple stuff mostly for now and I'm just waiting on two parts to complete a Hamilton and Wittnauer. Fairly simple models for starters. When I feel confident, I'm going to fix up the Waltham pocket watch that my grandmother gave my grandfather for their wedding. Thanks for the simple explanation of what you're doing to each watch. Great videos.
I think oyster bracelet fits better on this watch than jubilee 🤔
So neat to follow along on such a special watch. Did the back plate seal get replaced?
Really missed out on the barrel spring snap this video
It's a beaut, Clark!      Wow... Just an amazing watch and history.
Marshall, is that crystal made of some sort of acrylic? If that were the case, all those micro fractures could have been caused by someone trying to clean it with methyl, ethyl, isopropanol, or acetone. That is a known problem with that type of plastic.  Another great video, I enjoy them every time, and I don't even have a watch.
I expected the water in the ultrasonic cleaner to be so much dirtier after that case went through it
Just in time for thanksgiving thank you so much
Great job!!
Outstanding...Thanks
Hey, Marshall....absolutely LOVE your channel. The passion and genuine care you show for the watches (and their owners) is an absolute joy to behold. I'm by no means an expert here, but based on some of the projects you have taken on, this ROLEX will come out super sweet given the apparent condition of the movement (I'm only 10 minutes into this vid) even after you have just opened the caseback. Keep up the awesome work. Cheers from NZ.
I got so excited about this video, that i paused it, and went to get my own Rolex and now im watching with my Rolex on 😂
Vintage watch maker just become a high risk job 😅
i have a 5512 tropical dial in for resto right now. my dads watch. he paid $350cad for it new
You used a lot more blue grease than you usually do. How come? And you didn't lubricate the pallet fork jewels at their fiction points. Older video?
Absolutely amazed. I love how you explain every screw ad bridge.
I just find this channel and find very relaxing your videos
Did anyone else lose their mind when he closed the main spring barrel with that tiny piece of Rodico still stuck in the spring
Magnificent! Thank you for sharing.
Hey Marshall! Shouldn't the two hour hands be at the same distance apart? In the end when you change the time they finally meet at 12.00
Usually I'm not all that impressed with Rolex watches but that is an absolute unicorn. I suspect it would sell at the top of the range you mentioned should the owner ever wish to do so. You did your usual wonderful job. The movements in these may not be super fancy, but they are designed and made very well. I'm not surprised it ended up running so well. The owner should really be able to wear this if they feel comfortable doing so. I wouldn't wear it out of the house myself.
Holy. Shit.   That watch is a grail of mine. Seeing this so well documented is a great pleasure. Seeing a bakelite bezel in such pristine condition is extremely rare. That piece beautiful.   Thank you
That is amazing that you got to work on a watch like that, congratulations!  But I bet I know what that cracking on the crystal is about.  That looks like it was caused by heat, and that heat could very well have been caused by the radiation of the lume, over that many years, tucked away in a drawer.
I'm stunned at the level of engineering and manufacturing complexity from something from the 50s, it's beautiful, and hard to wrap my head around
Looks fantastic
awesome
King Kong screwed the back on it.
Holy shit a Bakelite GMT my grail!!!!
Just stunning Marshal.
Me too 😂
An explanation for the dial font variation might be down to the fact that Rolex used to change the dials as part of the watch servicing, and this could mean that a newer dial was fitted to the watch at the time of a service that had a different font to the original. I have heard this happen many times and the dial fitted would be the newest version at the time and not the original type. Delving into the service history of the watch with Rolex might reveal this, assuming it was done by an approved or appointed dealer. A truly incredible looking watch!!
it was amazing to be part of the restoration, thanks a lot for sharing that! a Rolex fun collector since 1994. This is a great channel thanks again.
The toolkits you are selling look very tempting.. Maybe I'll try to get into the hobby myself, instead of jst watching your videos all the time
Best one yet, Marshall.  Thanks for bringing us along with you.
Your content is always amazing. I’ve been fascinated for years about mechanical watches. I love it when the balance wheel springs to life. So satisfying!!!!
I didn't see it when I skimmed the comments, but the crystal isn't cracked. It's "crazed". This is a plastic crystal and plastic deteriorates over time resulting in this type of pattern.
That's just fantastic. Rolex made radioactive watches.  Hey Marshall, be sure and check you hair and teeth over the next few months ...and don't forget the lead-lined underpants!  Great video as always 😉👍🇬🇧
I love the patina that develops with those older bezels. That's a shame there's not too many around. 😊
Exceptional, fabulous work, superb result, you should be thrilled.  What a marvelous video, thank you!
a channel first, radioactive original rolex watch
I don't even wear a watch , I watch these videos because they are relaxing and take stress away.  The presentation and the explaning of what goes where and the tips are priceless.
Hello, I love your videos, always very interesting, I have an Omega Speedmaster triple date whose crown is broken and I can't find parts for this model, do you have any links where I could find this. In any case, keep up your work, your videos are truly inspiring.
That is amazing. Knowing the price of the watch I would poop myself repairing it 😂 Great job Marshall.
Marshall, I'm still wanting to see if you'd be willing to fix my 1920s art deco watchette. Any chance?
What was the timegrapher data after your restoration??
Amazing! Thoroughly enjoyed that... 👏👌👍
21:43 this parts shot post-cleaning was so good, beautiful movement
You did not take proper precautions for working on a radium dial. Multiple times throughout the video you touched the radium surface allowing potential radium particulates into the air, with no apparent mask on, fume hood, or any other precaution. Especially when initially removing the crystal which had clear particulate matter on it, with a likelihood of containing radium. You let this simply drop from the bezel removal tool scattering it's harmful dust everywhere.  If you even so much as inhale a microscopic particle of radium, it binds to your calcium receptors, and remains in your body emitting radiation for the rest of your life. You should really take more precautions. This is why so many watchmakers do not work on these. Not to mention the illegal transport of this watch that most likely occured when it was shipped. The PPM being released exceeds every single commercial shipping company standard, these things have to be shipped professionally in radiation blocking containers, marked radioactive, and handled with care.  I love the restoration, but this video is reckless when working with radioactive material with a long half-life that also binds to your calcium receptors making it impossible to ever remove. The person that shipped this to you likely committed a felony (not that the feds ever care since radium dials are common on Ebay).  Also when removing the bezel and crystal, why not just put a pillow or something under your tool. You just let it plop onto the mat instead.
That was a great video, Marshall. Thanks for sharing. From the UK.
Omg, thank you so much for starting up your website. I will be saving up to get my first set of tools as soon as I can afford it! Your videos have had me itching to try watch making for ages!!!
Marshall, that was brilliant.  Content, narrative, voice, and just wholesome.  You're the guy we need but don't deserve. Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving my friend.
Wabi  Wow just wow! I have a 2001 Sea dweller. THIS one is nice!
Stunning watch and great restoration man 👍🏼
Good job Marshall. That watch looks great.
What I can say is that you are a genius. - But why you did not polish the case ?
What a great surprise on Thanksgiving day..I'm a fan for sure..thank you and keep up the awesome work on these gems in the rough!
Is your voice edited on top of the video or are you litteraly talking live when you film it all? Top tier content btw
*- Marshall, you may be interested to know:* *- In the language of Physical Inorganic Chemistry, at **33:43**; "Surface Tension of Liquids" is the driving force that causes for the "Capilary Action" of sucking together the two halves of the Cap Jewel and Setting assemblies.* *- Liquids "clime up" the walls of capilary tubes because of the forces demonstrated by "surface tension" between said liquids and solid surfaces.* *- {In Chemistry tables there are lists detailing the respective surface tension enumerations for various liquids.}*
You truly are a master! I absolutely love watching your work and your videos!
After watching Marshall's videos for over a year, I feel like I could answer Trivial Pursuit questions about the names of watch parts!  "Where do you find a pallet fork?"  "Which wheel does the pallet fork feed off of?"  "What is the name of the spring inside of a watch?"  And I'm not really into watches, but these videos are addictive!
Lovely restoration, how scared were you to set the cyclops slightly off-center so the date wouldn't display perfectly? I went on my country's used market website, and ah...can get a gmt master for $15k-50k. I guess not :D Well there was a Seiko modded "homage" with the same style bezel and hands for $350..
Again, what a great vid. A naive question, what is the function of the jewel?
Hello I’m a new apprentice at Rolex and I just wanted to say that this video is a treat! So thank you!
when I got this back i would immediately sell it. this has to be peak price
Dear sir, your videos are fabulous. Congrats.
It looks like the GMT hand was touching the dial.
most valuable watch you ever worked on?
I watched this partly because I was born in 1958, and totally understand the passion in restoring this workhorse of a watch of this quality and originality, not because I was born in the same year evidently... 😊
Hey. Have you ever had this happen to you? You have a stubborn screw and when you think you broke it loose you actually broke it's head and the rest is stuck. That screw used to hold the crown wheel, so kinda important. How do you deal with that situation? Thanks
Beautiful job. Stunning.
Awesome.
Why don't the jewels go for a ride in the washer as well?
Fabulous! Well done Marshall. Nerves of steel. Great job!
Youre the bob ross of tiny assemblies
Curious; Considering the antique value and historical profundity of this watch to its owner and its builder, is the value of the watch impacted greatly by its owner choosing to not have this partial restoration/ full service performed by any other than the manufacturer itself? With the utmost respect, I cannot imagine myself allowing any other but Rolex to perform these necessary tasks.  And I could certainly see myself passing on buying this watch 2nd hand, knowing that it had been worked on by anyone other than Rolex. That’s not meant to be rude or dismissive of the great skill demonstrated in this video. Sentimental value aside, at this point the watch is an asset that would require the utmost effort to preserve its integrity and its actual monetary value.  Many highly regarded watchmakers would absolutely defer this particular service/restoration to Rolex, not because they are not capable but because it might not be in the owners best interests to take on when considering the value of the watch over the next 70 years! Not saying I’m right but these are my thoughts after watching the portions of this service/restoration demonstrated in this video.  Thanks for posting this video, absolutely fascinating timepiece  ✌️
that crystal shows the heavy signs of radiation cooking effects from the radium lume. I have an old Stowa from the 50s that had the same cracking effects on the crystal, i dont wear it so often because of the radiations though...
Beautifull, and scary at the same time. You did a nice job there. Keep doing it without trembling hands...🙂😉
WOW amazing watch
What an honor to be trusted with this historic piece.  Job well done.  I may have personally gone to Rolex if not just to get papers and a Rolex service certificate.
Gorgeous watch, gorgeous servicing 👌🏻.
Mesmerising! ❤
Happy Thanksgiving!!
It has a service dial so the value is a lot less than it would be with the original gilt dial.
A wonderful restoration.
Wow, that watch is fantastic. Is it possible to contact you for a repair on a watch I have?
I love the mechanical bits of your videos, that they're watches are cool, but a lot of it is just how everything fits together and the improvements you make fixing and cleaning them. But the visual before and after on this watch is downright stunning! There seems to be a reason why these go for the money they do, everybody wants one.
I enjoy your channel. Thanks & God Bless
You have no idea how happy I was watching this incredible work on this GMT thanks a lot ❤
The crystal probably got some organic solvent splashed on it. Some plastics do that when you get solvents on them, for instance acenton, old safety glasses did that when I got some acenton on them in the lab.
What an absolute beauty!. Wonderful patina with the spanking new crystal. Perfect 👌
Is it safe to re-use such a valuable and fragile Bakelite bezel?  I'd be tempted to store the original for safe keeping and replace it with something more durable.
Holy smokes is right!
Excellent  as usual. 👍
Do you ventilate when working with radium dials? I found this: “A radium watch becomes hazardous only when someone opens one and tinkers with the dials, inhaling radioactive dust particles." 😮
Another incredible show!  Thanks Marshall : )
Don’t know if anyone else mentioned it…awesome as this was, you needed to inspect the rotor stud for wear. The rotor has clearly been dragging the plate. This is a common failure point, and the reason Eterna’s ball-bearing rotor was an important innovation.
Wow looks great.
I personally hate patina.. I want to see everything restored the way it left the factory, or even better..
Wow!
Great watch and video, thank Marshall. Good website too.
Beautiful
Stunning!
That is an awesome watch.😅
Looks great, nice work!! 🎉
BRAVO !!!
Watching on Thanksgiving afternoon and it's probably one of the best things on YouTube
If only you would repair watches to new/near-new like the Nekkid Watchmaker.  This one would be an exception though. Lol  (I stopped watching him because he got political.)
It’s wonderful to see how confident you have become after a few years.  Well done!
Magic!  Thank you.
Usually I’m not much of a fan of Rolex watches, but this one is a stunner. Awesome job as always.
I wonder if this is subtle response to the guy in the comments from the last video who said they wouldn’t trust sending a watch to Marshal
Good job
I have never worked on a watch before.  After watching all of your videos I can follow along and i know each part as you are removing it.  I would live to do this but i dont think that my eyes are good enough anymore.  Love watching the show though. Amazing the work you do. Watches are amazing.
Shame the Service dial 😭
Amazing watch 👍🏻
Amazing restoration especially on such a rare and valuable watch well done 😊
I had a 1965 18ct gold daydate Rolex I sold for way too little it was serviced by Rolex and the refinished the case and the strap for the normal service price of ~300 USD (2008)bI wonder if Rolex would refinish this or leave it?
That turned out amazing. What a beautiful watch.
before the purple rolex reversing wheels clearly, wonder when they came in ? and i guess any dial re-finishing must have been relatively early in it's life since it got more radium lume which the internet says Rolex stopped using in 1963
Hi Marshall, Did you check the radiation of just the dial when it was out of the watch? I wonder, since the dial was refinished, whether the lume plots are still the original ones. I would say so, looking at how they glowed under UV. It does hurt the value though, that dial being refinished at one point. Probably took a $30k hit there.  Beautiful work, and a stunning watch nonetheless!!
but u didn't address the nuke thing ........
omg we all know how much money you tubers make on ad revenue, a few videos and you can afford that
My pediatrician as a kid wore that watch and I was always amazed seeing it. Great job breathing life back into it! Love this channel.
How long into repairing watches until you felt experienced enough to work on a Rolex?
Love your videos and I'm sure it's an okay watch but anyone willing to pay that for a beat up Rolex needs their head examined. Especially since Rolex never made much of it, if any of it.
I´ve looked at so many other watchmaker videos, but there are no one like yours!
That is a gorgeous, awesome job, Marshall. Beautiful restoration is impressive to see the before and the after,my goodness woah ... greetings from St George Utah...love this channel.. until next time..
I don’t even wear a watch…although I am looking for a vintage railroad quality pocket watch…..but I still have to watch these
do you have to line up the date ring in any particular way ?
Wow nice job!
Great restoration once again! Just a fabulous vintage watch!!👍
Was Rolex making this movement back then? It looks familiar..  awesome video and thank you for posting..
Marshall, your love of vintage watches and the restoration process really shines through.  I can tell you have a true passion for this hobby.  Best wishes from CA.
Just fantastic skill and master class. I am in absolute amazement at how you brought that beautiful piece to life.
I have an old watch that belonged o my grandfather that has the crystal cracked in a similar manner. Not a Rolex though :D
How did I end up here and stay amazed for 52 minutes? This awesome to watch and see true talent. NICE
Do you work on other watches.
Marshall, Where is a good place to source used rolex watches. I am wanting to add one to my starting colection and can't really afford a new one. Thanks!
What can be said but you are a master of your craft and what a difference! Bravo my man Bravo.
That was a real wear watch with all the years of use. Great find for the grandson I hope he can keep the watch.
An old perspex crystal can look like that, I have a 1969 Vostok Amphibia with the same cracking. As well as a Vostok GMT with a very similar movement method as well as the bezel fixing and functionality.
I’m going to assume that soda or something with lots of sugar spilled on it then caramelized everything. As for the bezel, a chemical was probably used on it causing the cracking. Locktite could cause that.
A cyclops and a rover press 🤔 🚘🙃
Loved that one 🍺🔥👌🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Seeing those little mesh baskets you use, I got some to use for cleaning carburetors in an ultrasonic cleaner. Keeps all the smalls together.
Wow, Wow, Wow....what lovely watch, and such skills Marshall. Nice one!
Nice work - I did wonder about replacing the radium with a safer material? How dangerous is wearing the watch all the time with radioactivity that close to a body?
Very cool watch! And thanks for curating a tool collection, I'm very much considering getting into watch repair as a hobby!
Marshall, hooked on your channel, but one thing I'd like to know, on a watch of this value what would a restore like this cost? I'm 61 retired vet and have a couple of rolex watches my Grandfather left me from WW2 Era needing a lookover and restoration I'd like to wear. Are you taking on any work? Thanks Pat
Thanks for another great video! Love the content
Love your.work.hey can tritium be replaced?
What a beautiful watch! Well done sir.
Instead of calling it a barn find why not a "drawer" find as where that appears to be where they are found
if you think you happy wait till the guy get it back
50:26 Deep blue? So it’s a Pepsi bezel? Man I thought it was a coke bezel! 😂
Awesome job great to see :)
What an exiting rescue operation on this amazing GMT Master ! Thanks for sharing !
Incredible. What a privilege to have this once in a lifetime experience of working on something so precious and rare. It needs to be worn and enjoyed. I was thinking, I wonder what was the occasion when it was bought and if only it could talk. It's seen happy times and sad times. I wish the owner many years of happy memories with it, and congratulations to you for an amazing result.
I checked out the website.  Very nice!  Good luck with that endeavor.
one of my favourite videos ever and i am a very discerning fellow..i love you..good work and good luck bruv..crack on...
lordy lordy,  hung grand!!! wow!
Nerves of steel to tackle a watch of that value.   Amazing.
Thank YOU for a GREAT Thanksgiving Present!
Wow! What a great video and very impressive your work on it. Turned out amazing.
Were it mine I would be afraid to wear in in public.  Might wear it while watching tv just to enjoy it.
Amazing job... Marshall, respect.
Thanks for the response on IG
Stunning
42:50 min that GMT hand seems to touch the indices
Congrats on repairing this handsome peice!
Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family enjoy the day 😅
such a pleasure to watch a Craftsman ply his trade.. congrats on working on such a historical timepiece!
great video as always, but should have used wooden tweasers on calander wheel. such a shame theres so many tooling marks on it now
The value of some collector items has just gotten stupid today.
Marshall, this restoration was not a safe one for you. The radium paste/paint on the dial and hands can, after several decades, result in microscopic radioactive particles that once the watch is opened up, be inhaled. The strangely fractured plastic crystal might further be the result of 65 years of radioactive emissions causing degradation of the polymer. Would suggest you use that Geiger counter of yours to check your repair equipment. Warning the recipient of the risks with the old crystal is further advisable.
Just wauw! I received my modern sub just about a year ago 41mm but the GMT Master is next up, I will never be able to afford a thing like this, totally understand your excitement!
Certainly one of the most beautifull restoration! This very watch resonates with falily history, and you did such a beautifull job keeping it as authentic as sharp working.  Hats down Mister, you're a Master at your craft, and it always brings such a soothing smile to witness your work & passion. But, this one is something else. Thank you!
Great video.
Dang... what a glorious service video. Great job, Marshall. Thank you for starting my Thanksgiving Day off on a high note.  Dang.
This morning I dropped my 1901 Hamilton pocket watch. The moment it hit the ground it stoped ticking……. I believe it was a model 940. 21 jewels, serviced before I bought it, kept amazing time. Anybody know where I can get it fixed.
Very sensitive and respectful restoration of a gorgeous watch. Well done, sir!
As rare as this watch is, we have an equally as rare youtuber that states the low end of the price bracket when talking about it.
Amazing....!
uuuuuuufffffff THAT  WAS AN AWSOME RESTORATION FOR SUCH AS LOVELY VINTAGE WATCH, I DO LIKED HOW YOU SERVICED, CLEANED IT WITH SO MUCH CARE PROTECTING THE VALUE OF THIS JEWEL, NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO TREAT A WATCH LIKE THIS.........CONGRATS!!!!!!!
I used to do a lot of work in a paint booth at my dad's machine shop back in the 90's and had a Timex that would get overspray on the lens pretty much every day. Lol! I would wipe that with lacquer thinner to clean it. That worked fine but crazing exactly like this started after a few years. I guess what I'm saying is that this crazing might have been caused chemically?
Nice
Excellent!
"You need to move the hands 24 hrs to advance the calendar" I don't know about Rolexes, but I used to own a non-quick set watch, and I could advance the calendar by simply going from 11:30 PM to 00:30 AM, and then move the hands back one hour. That was a Certina DS Action.
The automatic winding rotor did a LOT of rubbing on the plate !! the axis might be loose as hell from wear
pretty sure he worked on a farm..would be cool if you could hook up that dirt with another tuber or three
Hi Marshall, great job on the restoration - how can I get in contact with you about a similar restoration on a Tudor watch?  I have run into some dead ends with official Tudor shops - but I can see that you might be able to help.
Wow!
Wonderful watch. And a great service performed. Well done. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻😊🇩🇪
Outstanding work and absolutely gorgeous watch!! Cheers.
Too bad crown threads aren’t easily chased with a tap.
What a once in a lifetime opportunity. Thank you for sharing it with us.
Great looking watch!!  I never see my name on the list of patrons 😢
Great job!
So........YEAH!!!!! So........YEAH!!!!! So........YEAH!!!!!So........YEAH!!!!!! So........YEAH!!!!! So........ YEAH!!!!! So........YEAH!!!!!! So........ YEAH!!!!!  MY GOD!!! THE WAY PEOPLE TALK!
Most watchmakers won’t work on these…
That’s an awesome one ! Movement is straightforward to work on..tell me…is the value of the watch can make you nervous to work on ? Really good job, and of course final results is so satisfying !! ✨👌 Thanks for sharing and best regards Marshall !!
can’t imagine actually wanting to pay that kind of a price for a watch that will constantly be irradiating you, just because the name. it’s just so absurd on its face. but a lovely restoration.
Beautiful restoration and so cool to see the respect you had for this survivor of so heavy of a personal use by the original owner...
Beautiful.
I remember the first videos working on cheap mechanical watches.. and NOW u are working on a GRAIL Rolex.. THE best of the best vintage GMT 6542 aka Pussy Galore.. holy shit man
*Great job.* *_I'd be terrified to wear it, however._*
Hope you had some safety measures in place when dealing with the lume (filtration, mask, etc.). Radium is no joke. 😬
Being a $150k watch I'd like to know the original selling price of this in 1958. Yes, I tried to Google it, but all I got was current prices.
A beautiful vintage watch.
So how many times does the typical barrel turn in a day?
Just stunning, love it. Thanks for another amazing video, Marshall
A little insight from someone who is familiar with radioactive materials. Prolonged exposure to radiation has a tendency to discolor and embrittle plastic. That may help explain the strange cracking you see on the crystal.  On a side note, I love your channel and it's encouraged me to try doing this as a hobby. I'm getting closer to retirement and this seems like a great way to keep my mind occupied.
WOW! This has to be one of the most amazing videos you've made! That crystal though... that damage doesn't look like it's from physical shock, but weathering, like it's been sun bleached or extreme temperature or super low humidity for long periods of time.
i have had considerable success using tooth paste on a finger tip to buff  bakelite..on a piece likemthe bezel in this video, 5 minutes of gentle circular motion will revive gloss, color and return the "life", 10 minutes will polosh out minor to moderate scuffs and soften the edges/apparent appearance of heavier scuffing.....much like crystal polishing and geniune crystal polish is probably gentler than tooth paste
that dial  looks like the peace sign or  the nuclear disarmament symbol ☢
Sweet Jesus! How fantastic.   Thank you, thank you!
Once again verry impressive work to Matlin a piece of history and your knowledge of watches a pleasure to see always you shure have a great gift from God keep going I will keep watching great job
What a watch! Good for you being able to show it some over due love, I'm glad that you got this experience. Thank you for sharing it with us also.
Absolutely stunning restoration my friend. Your best one yet. I love watching your videos. They're so satisfying and informative. Great job 👍
Did you or the owner consider keeping the bezel separately and installing an aluminum one?  Such a rare bezel, shame to see anything happen to it
That is one incredible transformation!!!
There was a real Nytimes size scandal around these radium bezel Rolexes. Amazing history and very rare.
Marshall has never actually washed his car because he loves the patina so much.
Insides look like a creme brûlée - time torched candy brown gold bubbly lustre. Num num...
I don't understand the concept of wearing finger cots on all of the fingers that do not touch the watch, but not on the two that are constantly touching the watch.  Is it just out of tradition?
A once in a lifetime "Barn Find" ... and actually dates back to 1958 .. Original year of manufacture .... Your content is always wonderful sir ..
It honestly looks all original like it was never serviced. It was probably in a desk that was in the sun and the crystal was heat cycled too many times, that’s what leads to that cracking but it doesn’t look like it was apart at all or that dial would have been broken long before now.
Another fun one.  Many thanks. Surprised at the lack of watchmaker marks on the inside of the case cover.  I know it's frowned on today, but way back, nobody cared.  Did Rolex not mark the covers during a service?  Or is it actually possible this was serviced only once or twice in its career?  Might be why the original bezel survived.
The Glycine Airman predates the GMT Master in terms of dual time watches.
Love your commentary. It's relaxing, informative and interesting. Feels like a visit to your shop.    That crystal looks like it was cleaned with acetone. I have a pair of glasses that did that. It's called "crazing".
excellent job 😎
That was a good one! It's a pity you had to use this different bracelet, the contrast with the case is wildly obvious. On a different note, as a fan and long time follower of the channel: beware of falling into a "pattern". Sometimes it's almost as if you had a script and only changes a thing or two here and there.

WOW! Get a bowl of popcorn and settle in for this one. Amazing watch!
Sadly it says 'Page not Found' when going to the entry level kit on your website!
Wonderfull, just wonderfull - thanks!
Are there any watchmaking books you recommend for a beginner?
Very satisfying to watch. 👍🙏😊
For these radium watches, does he need to specially dispose the cleaning waste? Or is the radioactivity too low?
It literally glows. Fantastic.
Hey Marshall! Incredible video. My everyday wear is a 1956 (first year of manufacture) original "Pan-AM" GMT Master, reference 6542, that I purchased back in 1986. So cool to see the inner working of a true timepiece! Thanks!
Beautiful watch and beautiful work!
Beautiful restoration! Well done!
I like how you throw in some basic explanations aimed at newer viewers without talking down to your audience. I bet this watch attracted some viewers who otherwise might not be interested.
Radium is so dangerous. Vintage photos of the women who applied the radium show they died terrible deaths. So sad to see.
have you ever consider doing this full time because you are really clever at this
Hey Marshall!  Love your videos. With the crystal, it almost looks like chemical cracking to me. Certain solvents or acids can cause the material to develop cracking like this. I wonder if it took an accidental dip, or a cleaning was attempted using the wrong product, at sometime in its history.
Nice!
just food for thought. I have seen that kind of patterning on acrylic before. That was caused by solvents like alcohol, Lysol spray to be specific. Acrylic doesn't like those kinds of solvents, it tends to crack very nearly like that rolex did. It doesn't seem to be short contact, but longer term. The instance I'm speaking of, It was a small acrylic aquarium that stood off the surface it sat on with small bumps on the bottom. I sprayed lysol on the table it was sitting on to clean the table one day. I must've left a bit under the tank without realizing. The next morning, the whole front edge of the tank underneath was cracked almost exactly like that and leaking profusely. Obviously, I'm not saying that there's no way it cracked like that in any other way, but I wanted to throw it out there as food for thought as to possibilities how it COULD have cracked that way. Love your videos! Keep up the great work!
This hobby looks insanely interesting. If you want another desk hobby though that's a bit less finicky, more forgiving and cheaper then lock picking (and consequently, lock making) is also great. It was the gateway that got me to this channel.
25:12 - greasy finger on cleaned movement ??? Tut tut tut! 😵
I doubt Apple Watches would last even 5 years
That crystal will clean up with a little Polywatch.
The irony was not lost on me with you trying not to lose the "Born to fly spring" on a watch given to pilots.
How can someone be able to understand this stuff and fix it is out of my comprehension ...🤯
49:26 why are you using metal tweezers while dealing with the bezel?
Lol! 900 lumen. Bakelite bezle. Fantastic. Value between $70K to $195K.  I have no doubt. An absolute phenomenal presentation Marshall.  I love it!
Great video, Marshall - but unforgivable that you didn't rotate the bezel for us! 😭
gear wheel or cog wheel....are the terms i have run across in early vehicle repair manuals
When I see a watch like this,  it pains me that a modern Rolex will NEVER even develop the smallest Patina because of how bulletproof they are...
Crazy that you almost have 1 Million Subscribers. I still remember 2 years ago, you still had like 80k subs. 🎉
Great videos. Please insert a wrist model at the end… put it on for us.
Thank you for sharing a wonderful skill and artistry.  That watch is beautiful, like many I would love to own a watch like that but alas way out of my price range.  Will have to be happy with watching you restore these treasures.
Your comment about the condition of the crystal is spot on - unless it was due to a notable impact, it could also have been weakened by the extended exposure to the radium dial.
Rare as hen's teeth, and to find an original 6542 intact in the US, even more rare. There was a national recall of these in the 1960s because of a lawsuit by a gentleman claiming that the watch gave him and his family cancer, so Rolex went on to offer a free replacement of the bakelite bezel for one in metal. Taking into account how few 6542s were delivered to the US at the time and how few have survived over the years, this is TRULY an incredible find as this is also in an overall great condition. RIP to the original wearer and all the best to the future owner.
Amazing adventure. Well done Sir!
Having a video of servicing the watch has got to add even more to its value!
An absolute stunner great job bringing it back to life!!!
Yeah I was holding on to my seat through that one. I would never be able to not mess it up LOL
Captivating😊
OMG a grail of grails. I have sportspieces similar era Omega and Rolex in exceptional condition, but indeed fragile. You don't wear those in a normal way. Only sparingly. They're too special. One has a bezel that was produced in Q1 1963 in bakelite and is indeed irreplacable, or then only with a later version that is no longer correct. Treasure pieces.
I will order some tools from you as soon as I can afford it !  Saving the pennies hard now !
👍
Incredible video
Marshall, please check your ad settings. I'm getting ads every 6 minutes while watching this video! That's 8 ads in less than an hour, plus a start and end ad. I don't want continue to watch creators who allow obscene volumes of ads on their channel, and I know I'm not the only one. I love your videos, I've learned so much from you, thank you.
Incredible work..👍
At 60yo I am still notoriously ADHD - most of the vids I watch (95%) I skip ahead because I get bored. With yours I start them, park my mouse and watch (no pun intended) every second. You ROCK. I have 5 watches I need serviced. You've set the bar so high that even in the Dallas area I can't find anyone I trust like you. Darn you Marshall!
Another 100% stressful service!  Great job, and have a wonderful Thanksgiving!
I doubt that watch has ever been serviced. He likley bought it, wore it for 10-20 years then it stopped working or staying accurate so he put it away and likely forgot about it.
Good job.  That is one beautiful watch.
I wonder if one should wear a mask when working with those radioactive watch
So what are the health implications of actually wearing this radioactive watch?  Or does it just go to a collector who stores it in a lead safe ?
Almost as good as the antique roadshow guy.
That came out beautifully. Was terrified on your behalf about potentially cracking the bezel.
I'm nervous just watching the video.  I can't imagine what you were feeling working with such a fragile and valuable watch.
Go Like this video!
Is it just new or did the second hand start running before he removed the hands?
I wonder if crystal looks like this because of all that radiation? Since it's not shattered at all.
That was damn scarry.
Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.
Finally the 6542 Pussy Galore….. my grandfather left his 1958 one to me. Unfortunately Rolex got their hands on it in the 80s and replaced the bezel for the aluminium one but I still love it. I think the reason the glass is so messed up is that is not a normal Rolex crystal, but the first example of Perspex, the same used as the windscreen in the Hariott jump jet so I’ve been told. I love to see amateur horologists spot it on my rust and give a knowing nod as to most people it looks like a fake as it’s missing the crown guards like its modern version. Great video. Many thanks
Congrats... and wow getting to work on it at that kinda price point... yea that's a never wrecker right there.  you ok after all that bud?
There is enogh radium radiation to crack the crystal in all the years.
Yeehaw! A Turkey Day WR video with a beautiful '58 Pepsi GMT1 - Happy Thanksgiving, Marshall! What a unicorn!
Funny, for over 25 years I never knew what those tools were called, a 'pen vise'. That was a standard tool we used at FDD-A(FL Detroit Diesel - Allison) since the late 70s till now even to removed terminals from older style Detroit connectors(and some really old Allison ones also), Now its almost obsolete, with everything being made by companies like Tyco(yes the toy company makes harnesses lol). I still have 2 or 3 in my toolbox, just collecting dust. They come in handy to hold needles if you need a really small pick for something.   Also, I didn't quite believe that watch was worth that much, so of course I had to look it up, online it is called the Pussy Galore watch. Surprised you didn't reference the James Bond Goldfinger movie lol.
With all that Radium on the dial, I would not be surprised that the crystal was weakened by the acrylic cross-linking, the polymer creating longer chains by the ionization of some of the molecules bonding to other, likewise ionized molecules, over time. This creates a "harder" polymer, but with that increase in hardness, there is an increase of brittleness. I have seen examples of these effects on glass in a hazing of the crystal in a ring around the face of a pocket watch.
One of your best restos! My pulse actually went up when you removed the bezel. I suspect the crystal was routinely cleaned with an ammonia based window cleaner. I've seen aircraft Plexiglas windows do this when the uneducated owner used glass cleaner for years. Best of luck on your tool kits. It's a great idea. The website is first class.
Just WOW ! Superb old watch and excellent restoration 👍
awesome
Did I see that right, there are no markers on the inside of the case back. Could it be this never even got serviced until now?
Not enough oil on the balance jewel
This one's amazing!
radiation mmm mmm yummy
What a banger for turkey day!
hey! i'm Yarno from Belgium, i am a 22year old student and i would love to start working on watches. do you know a good wrist watch that isn't to expensive to start on? also i would love a beginner tutorial video of you because your content is awesome!!  greets from Belgium!
This is fascinating! It's going to have a lot of view!
MAGNIFICENT!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
A Marshall video on thanksgiving??!!! We are truly blessed
Aren’t you nervous about working with that radium? If it has a redial on it, it can’t be worth that much anymore.
I "found" this channel about 2 years ago and absolutely became a faithful viewer. I think of watched every video since my first and loved everyone. A few days ago I stumbled on one that was 3 years old. I was struck with the increase in your skill level over that short period of time. I think you had 3 springs take off on a short journey on your desk. You forgot to install a part in the proper order. Even your camera work was not the same as it is today. You must be proud that someone would allow you to work on a $100,000 dollar watch is a testament to growth as a watch maker.
Ahhh my beloved ref. 6542, I can only dream of owning one.  Thanks for the treat Mr. Marshall!
Very cool revival. I found myself holding my breath while you were taking off the bezel. Nice job as usual. Happy holidays
I think you missed your calling-you should have been a surgeon.😅
Amazing.  Nice job!!
You're an artist!!
I would love to have the opportunity to work on such amazing pieces of history. I find watch complications and their design just genius. My hands shake way to much and my patience will not permit me to perform such intricate movements and parts. However its fascinating to watch and enjoy these videos.
PS  I believe it was a Rolex Oyster dive watch.😊
Marshall…heart of gold looking after this watch.
I watched an antiques road show recently filmed in Phoenix.  A Vietnam  Veteran brought a watch he bought in the 60s. Never used, original box, paperwork, films on watch, on and on. Anyway he fainted when he was told it was worth $750k.  Look it up! Its worth watching, just for his reaction.
Hi. Amazing videos. How can I get In contact with you if I like to sent a watch for service? Thx
I shouted "YOU BETTER DO A VIDEO ON THAT WATCH" when I noticed you wearing it in a very recent video.   Absolutely thrilled that you did! Happy Thanksgiving Marshall, thanks for these videos.
Perlage is hidden, but the old heart skipped a beat when it was scratched nonetheless. 18:32
Don`t give up on that crystal Marshall, it`ll buff out for sure. 😁😁😂
Pretty close to the Holy Grail of Rolex watches. Great show, watched it TG morning!
Just Excellent. A career pinnacle. Thanks for sharing!
Hey Marshal! This one was really cool thanks for sharing. One question I had is that it seemed the rotor was loose on this watch. Is there a reason that you did not address it? The plating seemed to be removed from abrasion of the rotor on the main plate showing the brass underneath. You know way more about this stuff than me and I’m just genuinely curious.
Some people just have too much money on their hands. If I were a multi-millionaire, I still wouldn't spend that much for a watch.
So beautiful.  Now I want a travel watch even though I don’t go anywhere.
Awesome a 58 turned into a masterpiece again
Congrats on the website, and THANK YOU for this Thanksgiving Day gift of a video. Already checking out the website and thinking about this hobby. I still build and paint tabletop miniatures and have a mechanical background...so...who knows? Again -- congrats and thank you!
How you can remember where everything goes back together is beyond me. Top notch craftmanship, a pleasure to see!
Nice! I have a Rolex datejust from 1964 with engine turned bezel and alpha hands. I had it restored as well. I can see that you also couldn't replace the chrystal with a smothed domed one. Are they hard to find?
I really enjoy your videos and how meticulous you are when it comes to servicing watches.  Absolutely amazing work, the watch turned out beautiful.
I know nothing about watches.  Would warming up the watch before pulling the bezel off maybe lessen the chance of the bakelite cracking?
love watching these ....even though I have no watch interest..its the mechanics I love and the dexterity required to work on them!!
Unbelievable. I should be getting ready for the Thanksgiving drive, but this captivated me entirely. Thanks!
Love your videos Marshall! Keep up the good work!
The cracking on the crystal is caused by sunlight more then likely. Also certain chemical exposure can cause it.
Your videos are mesmerizing.
Awesome video, as always 🙂
What a beautiful watch  Another great video Marshall ❤❤❤❤
Now that's what I call a family heirloom!
Do you think that because of the radium over such a long time in the drawer could have really messed with the crystal and cracked it from the amount of radiation it was constantly receiving?
I’m so fascinated by your videos.  I’d love to do this as a third career!  Thanks for your content.  This is a “high-pressure” piece for sure!  Happy Thanksgiving!!
Believe the crystal cracking in such a pattern may be due to the substantial radiation from the lume
I love how you  reenact the  struggling sounds on the voiceover.
Can you warm the bezel at all to make it a bit less brittle? Hydration? Anything but prayers?
Beautiful watch, and what a find!
❤WOW just WOW❤
Oh my, what a special piece.
Making a real waterfall using wheels with the same percentage of size as the watch wheels would be beautiful. Thanks for the idea.
Amazing. I’ve been waiting for a piece like this from you.
Incredible! 😮
Wow, wonderful restoration!
Thank you Marshall for another great video of your excellent work (👍👏👌) on another Rolex (🤪).
8:12 is to the watch or the owner ☠Great job Marshall, Keep up the good work and quality content! Cheers
My nerves would've been through the roof.
Nicely done sir.
Great job, don’t want to be picky but the edge of the old crown appears to be slightly different, wel at least it is working again and in so much better shape then it arrived. 👌🏼🍀🫡.
One of the best restorations i've ever watched!
Yeah..BRAVO
A nice Rolex from the past.
You, sir, are a master at your craft.
A lot of the lady's that applied the luminescent material, not just to watches. Got mouth-jaw cancer as they licked the tip of the brush to get a nice point on the brush. The radiation is really not much of a danger now WHILE its not disturbed and turns to dust.  A fantastic watch.
GREAT video. I have a 1978 GMTMaster and not worth 6 figures but I'm pretty amazed how much this $645 watch in 1978 is now worth.
I have a 1979 GMT 16753 that needs a service. Interested?
You made history with this video
i see a little bit of blue on some threads , do you use locktite  ?
Literally the equivalent of wearing a Picasso on your wrist. Stunning. Beautiful. Amazing. Just wow.
Unbelievable. Great work Marshall.
Marshall, I saw cracking like that on the crystal while in the Army.  We had shatterproof acrylic type windshields in our Humvees.  One night while deployed to Panama we were applying Army issue bug repellent on our arms, necks and faces.  My driver had some on his hand and smashed an insect on the windshield with his open hand.  We instantly heard a crackling sound and and saw a hand shaped pattern of cracks going through the entire inner layer of the windshield.  It looked identical to your crystal.  Just over a much larger area.  We did replace the windshield as soon as we could but the scary part was, if Army issue bug repellent could chemically shatter thich shatter resistant windows what was it doing to our skin?
Timegraph doesnt look great. Bit of a wobble to the balance wheel as well. Im surprised you still arent doing any precleaning or pegging jewel holes. Especially on such a dirty watch like this one.
Congrats on your hard work and effort with patience!
Wow, that is something special. Maybe once in a lifetime
I can't believe I watched the whole thing without skipping a second. And i am not even into watches, I don't know their value at all lol.
Spectacular job. Very tastefully preserved
Old toothbrushes are so versatile  -
That joke is as old as I am and I hope you got a tickle out of it.
Hi Marshall.  I understand that when you were given this watch for sevice your were told that it had just stopped working after years of service.  When you opened the case you found a very small dead bug and you informed the owner that you had discovered the cause of the stoppage:  The Engineer had died!
suggestion: try to show parts of the conversation with your clients, show us your workplace, show and tell how you prepare them for shipping. are you documenting what parts were changed, what work has been done and which oils were used for the next watchmaker and are you able to make a profit by repairing watches or are you mainly dependend on patreon & youtube?
I have many old guns that have bakelite grips. Most US made bakelite grios even from tje 1910's are pretty good. But french bakelite even into the late 30's wasnt great and shrink badly.
Fantastic video, once in a lifetime for many seeing / working on one of these 😍 Wasn't there supposed to be a flat gasket under the bezel?
I don't usually get excited about Rolex watches BUT this one is special. I ran across an article about these somewhere years ago although the value shocked me.
It has to be gratifying that someone trusts you with a watch like this.  This is like a unicorn!   Another great video Marshall!!!
nice work!
Do you not oil the center wheel pivot or is it jewelled?
OMG! What a beauty. Fantastic work on this Marshall. Definitely a case for practicing "less is more". A wonderful result.
Marshall, I'm surprised you didn't "accidentally" missed putting in the mainspring in the barrel just to have an excuse to use your winding tool. :-)
You're amazing dude.  Nothing to contribute, just wanted to tell you.  I love watching you work (and listening to the knowledge you spit).  Thanks man.
When you are putting the new mainspring in, could you not use your mainspring winder set, kind of like using a socket to press a bearing? It always looks precarious when tweezers are used. (Not trying to be critical)
Honest wear. Just beautiful.
Thanks for sharing have a great thanksgiving everyone
The damage to the original crystal looks to me like solvent-induced stress cracking.
I got a question that's probably stupid, but I'm asking out of a lack of general knowledge. My first thought seeing how filthy that watch was to just throw the entire thing minus the bezel into the ultrasonic and run it a few times. Would that even be a viable option to loosen a bunch of that crap up or is that too extreme for an assembled watch?
I'm sure it's safe to say,  that marshall is indeed a full blown watch maker.
Something to be thankful for… A new vid from Marshall! Happy Thanksgiving!
A beautiful watch indeed, from the days when Rolex made really good watches without feeling the need to cover them with excessive decoration. Many years ago (in the late 1960s) when I still wore my Dad's 1946 Rolex, I was doing some volunteering in a hospital that was researching the radioactive implants that are now used to treat some cancers. They had radiation detectors at all the entrances and exits to the hospital in case any of the trial patients tried to leave, as the implants weren't yet approved. I wondered if the radium on my watch face would trigger the alarm - it did. All the doors automatically locked and nobody could enter or leave until they'd accounted for all the implants! I was a little embarrassed...
Simply stunning! Wonderful job!
It's always a pleasure joining you on these journeys. Excellent video as always and what a fantastic timepiece.
I am shocked at how radioactive that lume paint really is. I thought it would only be a little higher than the other, and not registering as high as it did.
Stunning watch to work on. Love the before and after shots too
Watches like this are soooo incredible.  I mean, you have to really appreciate even the smallest things.  Like how the crown wheel, instead of turning on a tiny narrow shaft, are made to slide around a (relatively) large diameter wheel, clamped by those two tiny plates.  This is probably because, next to the barrel itself, crown wheels have the most torque on them and thus the most side forces on their teeth.  Fun little thing about 'radium dial' watches.  When I was serving on nuclear submarine, they weren't allowed on board because of their radioactivity.  If a sailor's radium watch broke we would have to go through a whole 'radioactive contamination' clean up to deal with it so they were simply banned outright.  (well, the ship's divers had some for diving, but they were actually kept locked up except when a diver was actually going to go in the water).
For 100k watch , no polish , no clean the bracelet.Rolex is not a watch , they still the people money only from advertising, with what is help Rolex in this industry (horology) ? What they give in 115 years ? They take one mechanism from here , one from there and after put some “stars” to wear and this is Rolex ! What’s the point to pay so much money for a watch what is the same like 50 years ago ? When people will understand the cost of production for a Rolex or a iPhone is like 1% of the total price will be not so happy to pay 99% only because is a trend or others buy ! In the days 1960 / 1970 a house in California was 7000-10000$ and people can afford to buy in 30 years (credits) now if you go in California to buy a house is impossible even if you let your children to pay the credit ! Where do we go with the prices ?
Yet one more thing to be thankful for today. Thank you Marshall, I loved loved loved watching this.
Just needed some lighter fluid and a match it'll be serviced fine ;)
I hate to say it, but I'd sell it in a heartbeat. It's a life changing amount of money for most people, plus there is absolutely zero confidence I'd have in keeping it safe. If it were a $5000 watch or something, maybe I could keep it. Easy come, easy go. But I'd never forgive myself for smacking that thing off a metal railing or something and destroying the Bakelite ring.  If I had the money to own it, I could convince myself to buy a spare ring, swap it over, and keep the Bakelite one, but even so, I don't know how I feel about it.
At 7:07, what tool is that that makes it start up again? :)
Wow!!!!!! Absolute stunner.
Started watchmaking recently, still waiting some tools as we speak, some arrived today, now all i need is some experience, already took apart old Tissot T12 automatic, learned alot from just taking it apart few times :P
Amazing 👍
My absolute favorite watch! I hate how expensive they are lol
I thought they had stopped using Radium by 1958? Guess not. I’m kinda afraid of radiation so I don’t really want a watch that has that old lume on it. Okay maybe this one lol.
So Beautiful!
Thanks for the holiday present, Marshall.  Have a safe and happy T-Day.
Wow, what a piece of history.  Your care and attention to detail are second to none.  Well done.
I think that crystal was exposed to some solvent.  Acetone maybe.
If i were in this guys position best thing i could found in grandpas desk was a nice swiss made porcelain teeth😂.....
Not sure I’d be comfortable wearing a radioactive watch
The crazing on the crystal looks like what happens when you use certain cleaners (like Scrubbing Bubbles) on the clear acrylic bathroom knobs that were really popular in high-production homes like... 25 years ago. ... Not that I know anything about that or ever had them shatter from years of using that cleaner... >__>;
How do you remember where the removed parts go back together.
Lot of patience that requires to be a watchmaker. Wash, rinse  and repeat until everything is perfect .No  flaw is permitted .
Marshall - how do you retest the water tightness pressure capability?  My own Submariner had to go to a rolex dealer for a pressure test to ensure water tightness.  Do you do the same thing?
Did I see the second hand running just before removing?🤔
Hi Marshall, what a treat! Now I’m not a Rolex guy, but this being a band find was so interesting. I might have turned down this job considering the value! What case removal tool was it you used and do you like your horotech bezel remover? I’ll check out your website. Ta!
Wow! wow! and wow! 👏
Absolute stunner.
Awesome restoration, but the bezel of GMT's don't rotate, they have the extra hand instead.
are you radio active now?
Pardon my lack of expertise, but doesn't cleaning the "patina" from the watch lower the value? thanks for the entertaining and informative videos and website!!!!
WOW, Wow,, wow! Amazing. That is a watch I would be thankful for. Happy Thanksgiving, Marshall.
The voiceover work with grunting included (6:30)! Bonus!
What a beautiful watch! Happy Thanksgiving and thank you for the videos you share with us. Your channel has made me appreciate the hobby so much more.
This is an unbelievable restoration and unbelievable vintage watch.  Would’ve loved to see that in person
I would love to see your face, when you have that satisfying laugh, after the entire watch comes together.😀
Absolutely unbelievable work!! Really enjoyed watching this it's definitely the best vintage watch restoration I have seen so far ever!! Well done you have done the  watch so much justice. We must take our hat off to the watch maker here. 🙌👌
That watch was worn by a working man.
10:52 it's running
You make this stuff so engaging and accessible that you almost make me think I could do the same!
This is similar to watching a super technical surgery except it's a watch and not a human. Incredible amount of skill and knowledge here. Wow!
Best vid yet..just so cool
Nice work yet again :):)
Here comes a treat for weekend came early
Well it`s about bloomin time Marshal (no pun intended)!
Wow❗ resurrection  💖 another 6 decade of life....
Very interesting & pedagogic as always!  Whilst working with Ra dial, which precautions have you enforced? Is there any danger of cross contamination ? Thanks!
Hey Marshall, been watching for a while, love the content! You got me in to tinkering around with watches too, I was finally able to get my own decent set of tools. Last thing I have really been wanting is a microscope or something to use that isn't an eye loupe, using only one eye with the loupe just isn't working for me. What do you use when you're working on watches??
Awesome as always....  How much was the replacement glass? And what does it usually cost for watch service/cleaning?
must have been nerve wracking dude. great job as always. smooth sailing
Respect your decision to service it.. keep in mind radiation over your counter will stay for a mighty long time.
What a "once in a lifetime" experience for you, Marshall! Wow! Words are not enough to express appropriate thanks for sharing it with us.
What a great watch. I really enjoyed this video.
When you work on something like this, do you provide some sort of proof of service for the owner , detailing what you have done or replaced, on the off chance that the owner would need to sell sometime in the future, hopefully they would keep it to pass on through the family.
would you trade if for an alpha Black Lotus?
The bezel worth more than this particular watch since the dial is refinished
Amazing piece of history. And now you're part of the story of this watch. Great work!
Great job .. your fast becoming a master craftsman
I would not even dare touch that watch. Lol  Bakelite. Radium. High value. I’m so nervous. Lol
Astonishing work! In the famous words of Indiana Jones, "That belongs in a museum!" 😂😂
What a treat for Thanksgiving morning! When I woke up I was wishing I had a new Wristwatch Revival video to watch.  Thank you Marshall.
What a beautyfull inside for a fairly regular looking watch! The dedication and craftsmenship from back in the day is absolutely wild, now we can make them cheap and easy enough that china sells automatic watches for 20 bucks, but something like this was valuable for the precision of the pieces and skill of the engineers, lots of time and care for every single one, that's proof of how passionate they were about it
Awesome video! I do find myself getting sleepy when watching these though, think its your very calm voice :D
As with so many other you inspired me to start repairing watches. thank you, I love doing it as much as watching it. However now I get nervous when you work on the cap Jules. There is just no conveying its true size and fragility on video. Amazing work 👍
This hands-pressing tool looks sooo unprecise. I'm sure it's perfect for the job, but it still looks like it's five sizes too big.
Holy Shitballs Marshall!  Fact: 90% of veteran watchmakers would not have the ca-hones to touch this thing.   Amazing job on an absolute grail.
Is the face bakelite too?
Hey Marshal, I had to watch this video immediately- I was an hour late back to work but when I saw the watch … What an amazing piece of history- Also I wonder what the original radio active reading was when the watch was new - I know the original military Submariners were recalled by Rolex to have their dials swapped due to the exceptionally high readings - Amazing video as always sir 👍👍
Not to get too geeky, but I believe the properties that allows the cap jewel to stick to the setting are cohesion and adhesion.  The oil wants to stick to itself which is cohesion.  The oil also likes to stick to the cap jewel and setting which is adhesion.   Capillary action is a passing through of a substance through a medium.  Adhesion is the most accurate description.  Ya, that was too geeky!🙄
Fabulous Marshall, words alone cannot express my admiration for your ability and skill. Excellent.
Happy Thanksgiving Marshall! This is definitely a barn find! Wish I could find something like that...
Marshall, this was a great episode. It was a treat just to see a watch like this. I wish I could say it was mine. Great job!
Damn, who finds a 100k watch in a drawer lol
I love your channel, your videos and commentary are so calming and interesting, always a treat! And its especially wonderful seeing you work on such a beautiful watch!
Hi Marshall, found your channel by luck, couldn’t take me eyes off this addition top work. Thanks
Great video. Thank you for sharing this. Decades of history right there. Now it’s ready for more decades. 💪🏻💪🏻
I've seen that type of "cracking" on acrylic. I had a nice case with a curved acrylic front bezel and when you try to clean it with stuff called "Goo Gone" it did that.  I'm thinking you hit just the wrong type of solvent is the problem.   Outstanding job on the watch!
Thanks for the web site, now I know what tools I need and where  to find them! 😂 or as I said "shut up and take my money" 😂
I was holding my breath during the bezel removal!!!
It looks like someone used a solvent on the crystal.
Great Barn Find!! Great Video!! What's next? Another Barn Find?
Awesome as ever! while i'm not a Rolex fan, the way you work and the passion you have is exceptional, love watching you work regardless of watch brand. thanks Marshall
Hi! Awesome and so satifying videos, Thanks! Just wanted to ask about packing the parts in the cleaning machine baskets but of course you already answered a few seconds after!
$100K for a watch that can give you cancer? No, thanks!
I covered my eyes when you pushed the bezel back on. In my mind that was riskier than removing it! Great work, I love watching these as my therapy now I've run out of Baumgartner Art restorations to watch.
Stunning work as always Marshall gorgeous peice 😍
My grandfather left me with his Timex that was probably worth $20. To me, it's just as priceless.
After that Gieger...i would'nt have it in the house...
Really nice watch and marvelous effects after but I noticed some weird stuff on end of the widow when you start going with setting the time red hour hand was going in the different speed than normal hour hand from my understanding both of them should work in the same time manner if both of them are hour hands
Happy Thanksgiving Marshall!  Another great job - I wish more videos were as well produced.
Hi Marshall Can you explain the "dial" on the balancewheel: F to S.   What is it, and how do you (and we) use it?
Lost count on how many ads this video had but like a true warrior I toughed it out just so I can see how this turned out. No regrets
Your skills are amazing to watch, if anyone could do this watch justice it would be you, thanks for the post
Since the watch started running, I wonder if it was retired to the drawer ultimately because the band broke.
You are getting crazier by day. And you drive me in to your madness
What a fantastic watch to work on! Great video as well.
Absolutely amazing. What a watch and what a fantastic work you put into the service!
In regards to that radium, I hope you're using some kind of respirator and also make 100% sure you don't leave any potentially contaminated dirt from the watch on your table or yourself. You honestly really shouldn't have done this restoration.
Wow I never expected to see a watch like this on your channel. Congratulations
The cracking on the crystal like can be caused by exposure to a solvent such as acetone.  It partially softens an outer layer and the stresses within the plastic underneath this layer are given s layer that acts as a stress riser.  This results in the spider type cracking you see here.  It's a similar effect with tempered glass having a decent temperature gradient before spider cracking with no physical contact.
ugh, can't believe they had the dial re-finished at some point.  brutal.  Great job on the restoration though.  It looks great.
What an absolutely beautiful incredible watch. I have always wanted to own a Rolex and can you imagine finding this in a drawer. Well done for a great restoration and making this rough diamond shine again 😊
Great video, Marshall, as usual. If i am not wrong, you left a little, very little piece of rodico between the spring and the barrel body.
Based on your Geiger-counter measurement (~6.5µSv/h), it is higly recommended to not wear this watch :D. If worn 24/7, it would represent approx 56mSv for a year, which is basically 50x the max limit to absorb from an artificial source (because we also need to consider natural/medical exposure). For example, if an area is measured at 5,5µSv/h (=50mSv/year), evacuation is strongly recommanded... In USA, exposure limit is 50mSv/year, all source included, (natural, medical, industrial, food, etc). Here, only by wearing this watch, you're ALREADY above the limit if worn 24/7...
What a video , gorgeous watch , fantastic job Marshal , you are an artist . brilliant just brilliant .
I've been following you since the beginning and I like that you're improving! BUT...I must comment on your finger cots. Please make sure you have a cot on any finger that touches the metal after cleaning! I noticed a couple shots where your right ring finger ie pressing on top of the plates. I hope you cleaned them after your finger oils leave marks and possible damage later on. Keep improving!
Nice watch
You should never send this type of watch back to Rolex. They will destroy the value by replacing many parts especially the hands….
radioactive🤣🤣🤣
i noticed that you originally put a gasket on the stem and one in the crown but when you replace the Crown you didn't mention putting one in, did you not mention it or did you not put one in and if that's the case would that be the reason why they original crown did not work?
Just a thought, have you ever tried using a solution of regular domestic biological washing detergent for case and strap cleaning? Most of the soils that need removing are at least part biological in origin. As a bonus, you know it’s not going to harm anything or one’s washing machine would be at risk.
I happen to know some amazing items that can be handed down..My grandfather had a serious collection of pocket watches. Not many wristwatches unfortunately,  The ones he did have were pretty generic leading up to a Timed.  But I still enjoy them as a few of them hold special value in my collection. As you know I collect Swiss mechanical chronographs. Most are of course the ole 7750. I am glad this is the first watch video since I came back down to the lower 48 . Nice to see this channel. One of my ultimate favorites in YouTube. Thanks for the upload kind sir once again.
Awesome watch
Something bothering me. Does the bezel turns tho?
Anyone interested in the radiation from these watches should read up on the Radium Girls https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_Girls  In short, they were watch and clock dial painters. They were told to use their mouths to 'point' the brushes. They all started getting loose teeth, lesions etc. Huge scandal and a sad story.
I wish you could append your videos with you giving the watch back to the owners to see their reactions.  I’m sure some of this is through the mail, but maybe they record their un-packaging and first look even.
This was too cool. And it includes radioactive materials? Yes please! Excellent content. Thanks for posting ❤
Could it be a Rolex service dial? I find it hard to believe that a watch in that state would have had a refinished dial. I’d be curious to know what the clues the expert used that brought him to that conclusion
im just curious why you put a lot of parts in one small basket while there are more small baskets that you can divide the parts equally between them and they will have more space to get contact with the cleaning solution ?
Great restoration of this beautiful watch. Good job and thank you.
make that half the price...if even that.
Certainly out of my league, but so similar to what I enjoy doing with old Seiko watches (and odd G-Shocks). I take great pleasure in breathing new life into them, using as few new parts as possible. I wish I had the knowledge and confidence to actually work on the movements, rather than replacing, but that will come
Sick watch! Looks great, nice work
Amazing!!!
Hi Marshall. Great work, and great video. I have a question. I have seen you do a preasure test on diving watches to see if they are water tight. On this expensive watch how can you be assured that it's ok to go swimming, or take a shower?  I know it is a Rolex, and all 3 gaskets were replaced. Is that enough to be confident that no water will get in? Thanks so much for your hard work.
Stunnning
I really hope you've addressed the rotor slop without showing us - it has already rubbed off most of the plating on the outside of the movement.
Will the radioactivity be a problem when wearing this watch?
Wonderful video and one of two of my favorite watches! Stunning. 👍
Three videos in one month? It's early Christmas!
THANKS,,,GREAT VIDEO !!!
Marshall's Cannon Pinion Removal Tool has been mentioned dozens of times, he's clearly proud of this tool.  I wonder if it needs a name.  "Carpet" is obvious, but I do not like that one iota.  I'm being silly, I've never noticed Marshall to name his tools, but it's a fun concept :)  He could even come up with "Pinioneer" or "Cannonator" something else, or he could roll his eyeballs at me and tell me "nice try, buddy" :D  On the other hand, I think it's more professional to keep it as is.  Sorry, Marshall, I'm just a goofball.  I'm sure you can relate to some degree.
Absolutely incredible! These watches are just like antique firearms, keep them clean and they’ll run forever. Beautifully done sir!
I remember setting the time forward to midnight, letting the date click over, then reversing time for a couple hours, then rolling forward again to get another day to pass. Someone tell me I am not imagining this? If it really works, why does Marshall never use the trick?
It’s amazing how even back then rolex were sooooo easy to work on. Absolute tanks. The reputation is well deserved. It’s a true shame to see the state of affairs in modern day rolex, it’s extremely off putting to the true watch enthusiast.  I’m so glad you got a chance to work on this watch! A literal grail moment
Next find and restoration Harrison H6, coming soon.
no corrosion it's "patina"  :D  but the moment will come when you have to restore the case.
Really was looking forward to seeing the bezel turn!
Bezel made of bacon light ... Mmmmmmm sounds delicious ❤
Great video as usual I wish I had your skills Marshall. The bezel to me looks black and red which would make it a coke and not a blue pepsi but the year doesn't match up. The coke didn't make its debut till 1983 with the GMTmaster II. Either way it's a beautiful watch nice job.
Love watching you repair watches, I find it relaxing.
Awesome job very intense 😳  Marshall
Thanks Marshall that a fabulous video super interesting 👍
This is without doubt one of the best watch related videos I have seen in a very long time...   Repairing a watch is very very very rewarding and I have done a few now but this i something else !!!  Absolutely brilliant to be working on a grail watch like this 💪🤩
wow... you mean that someone's Grandpa actually had/has a real rolex and not a folex?!?! lol jk but wow
Hey Marshall,   Thanks once again for another great video. I love the new website, its exactly what i've been looking for. Just an idea: if you sold a bundle deal, with a watch (or movement), along with a toolkit, and then coupled that with a video (or series) detailing the process of the disassembly and assembly of that movement (in a tutorial fashion), i think this would be an amazing way for someone like me to get into the hobby with everything i need to be successful
Awesome as Always... Wow what a cool Vid   Thankyou
Incredible video. I couldn’t stop watching and the end result is oddly inspirational.  Makes me feel like I can be appreciated even with all my patina!  Thank you.
This was like watching someone defuse a bomb. I actually started sweating watching this.
I had a feeling this would happen :)  I discovered your amazing channel over a year ago, Marshall, and I noticed at one point you happened to be releasing videos on what appeared to be a regular basis, like every few weeks or so.  I'd gone back into your videos and I watched nearly ALL of them (can't get myself to finish the Micky Mouse one, sorry lol).  I noticed that some of your videos took a LONG time for you to finish, even though it was mere seconds for us.  In other words, while you were waiting for parts, two weeks would go by, etc. etc.  So I knew that you couldn't necessarily keep to a regular release schedule due to situations beyond your control.  Fast forward to a few months ago and I noticed that you hadn't released ANYTHING in a while (I think there was a two month gap).  I had two theories: You were really busy with other stuff, or you were working on several projects at once and they were all delayed for whatever reason.  Probably a combination of both.  Sure enough... these last three weeks, you've dropped THREE videos for us and as soon as I notice, I have to drop everything so I can be mesmerized.  Obviously, this is not a complaint about your release schedule, it is more of a guess/observation on the inner workings of your hobby.  There's a lot of hurry up and wait and multiple things going on at once, and that must be both challenging and FUN for you.  No wonder you love what you do.  If you were to go into a deeper dive about how you do things, like the behind-the-scenes, I'm sure you'd have a rapt audience!
Looks like it started running around 9:00
Something tells me the fact this video exists raised the price of that specific watch.
Stunning restoration, thank you. I wonder if the former owner died of wrist cancer?
Wow, incredible work! I would love to start this as a hobby, but can I ask as a beginner how to remember where every part goes when you reassemble?
Where the hell did Pepsi Bezel come from Pan-Am?  I think Pan am is cooler and I never knew that...
I love these old rolexs, this is my literal lifelong dream to find one like this lol
Crazy that the watch just turned 65 years old on November 18th.
If anyone is curious, the cracking on the glass is caused by a chemical reaction with a solvent that is not compatible, such as denatured alcohol. The solvent would dry out the top layer, causing it to shrink, then crank from the surface stresses.
Marshall, do you do the voice over after or during video recording?
Incredible. Lucky but well-deserved to get your hands on this incredible piece. You're the goat of watch yt.
I don't understand the hype around Rolex.
My royal oak watch new want run that watch is nice u got
Alpha particle damage on the crystal
👍👍
sticky bezels:  get the watch on edge and place a drop of wd40 on the joint, and allow it to run around, and soak in.  your cleaners will easily remove it afterwards. no, i'm not on commission
Hey Marshall is that an acrylic crystal or a mineral one?
2 videos within a week what a treat
These "barn finds" are so exceptional. Congratulations and thank you for sharing the content.
Do you think the crown O-ring might have been too fat, preventing the crown from grabbing the thread?
Another lovely job done on a very valuable watch. The ownwer will be delighted.  Thanks :)
I think  the glass is a bit done...
You've got life skills
33 year old plumber here and you sir are a magician inspiring me to get into watch making and repair.
Your best yet! I so enjoyed this.
Your videos are usually so soothing to watch. This one with its short cuts and different angles, was harder to follow. Plus it made me kinda seasick. Had to stop halfway. Like it better the old way.
Hopefully he keeps the watch in the family Instead of selling it.
Congrats man! Glad you got a chance to work on a watch like this!
whats the plus and minus on the balance wheel for.?
What does a service like this cost?
Water is the first solvent 💦☝️well done big after reward ✅
Oh my!
I had the wrong grandfather 😂
Gripping video. Fantastic job. Thanks for sharing. John
You're cool.
Stunning work!..
Another fabulous video Marshall, the movement in that watch is beautiful - thanks again for sharing and all of your hard work - keep it up.
Always such wonderful service craftsmanship in repair and so beautifully narrated and produced.  You are blessed dear Sir! Happy Thanks Giving!
Wow, I’m so impressed with your talented and precise work.  You, sir, are not only nimble of fingers but also have a gift of conveying helpful information about each watch.  Even though I’ll never be attempting to repair or even open a watch, I’m fascinated.  I’m almost 80 years old and I found your channel and just discovered that my 50 year old son is also a big fan of yours.  I can’t believe he actually texted me the other day and said, “Hey, Mom, have you seen this one?”  Unbelievable!  Thanks from mother and son in PA.
Just think, you're probably the first person to have ever opened this since it left Rolex in 1958. A lot of people back then never took these in for servicing because they were a useful tool watch and people bought them to actually wear, abuse and enjoy. Today, people treat modern ones as an investment and better than their own children lol edit: I see that it was opened before with the dial having been restored in the past. An awesome watch and looks great!
Now days, are the gaskets made of silicone instead of rubber.?
Magnificent.  That bezel raised my blood pressure a bit tho...
Definitely not a 100 thousand nice
What a find!! @DavideCecchini guarda questo
I thoroughly enjoyed this.  Fascinating
Every time I watch one of your videos I want to take up wrist watch restoration as a hobby.
This watch looked as if it had never been serviced as there were no scratches on the inside or just a few lite ones
@15:37 looked like something went flying?
I would love to have seen it given the pressure dunk test, just to see if with new o-rings if it's still mostly water resistant.
Gorgeous job & gorgeous Rolex GMT
You scratched the watch 18:32 !!!
That was a beautiful watch, I can not believe how much it would go for but I guess if you have the money, well done again for keeping us informed & entertained.
Amazing that you where abel to fix it. Great work.
Where was your dang website last year when you actually *did* get me into watchmaking? Lol, it would have come in handy! Got a few old pocket watches under my belt, gonna try to dive into a wristwatch sometime soon.
It could be possible that the new crown gasket is too thick so the threads on the crown don't reach the threads on the crowntube! I would take the new gasket off and retry fitting the old crown on the case!
your quick with cleanings, only 52 and a half minutes! (😁)   hopefully your videos inspires young ones to get into restoration of watches. after watching a good number of videos and having an understanding, a good set of tools and some practice watches to mess with one could get some good experience. thanks for doing the videos.
Omg pleassseeee don’t polish it
Why does the top to the barrel have a hole in the side ?
Wow amazing watch.  Just a note there are so many adds in your videos now, is this anything you can control ?   Keep up the  etc great work.  A mate and I are slowly getting organised to get some tools and start watch servicing.
Hi Marshall  This is so spooky , i have a 2 colour gmt master II 2003 vintage , but noticed that this beauty was born november 1958 the same as my birth date. I must have be destined to have one of these, maybe i should try to get a vintage year one too, great video though as usual.
man, clicking that bezel back on by hand had me stressed! Wouldn't it have been safer to do it with a tool that could apply even pressure?
Hi you were talking about solvents for the cleaning Maschine what do you use or recommend. Love the videos
I've never met another Sutcliffe before 🤔 Nice to meet you haha
Amazing!!! Well done!!!
At least there were no chickens or rats nesting in this amazing barn find, LOL.
1:00 my uncle's is the same. Nearly identical pattern around the magnifying portion of the lens. Considering how old this is, IMHO it's the crystal formulation that's at fault. Not all models in this year have this, but some do (as per forum posts i've read). 2:18 And that's why it will remain with the original, cracked everything as is. Those things are not safe. :) That watch rated at 7.03msv/h with a Horiba pa1000 which is pretty precise.
Any chance you could do a chronograph one day, would love to see you do a video on one of thise
Absolutely fantastic! Yet another incredible video masterpiece. Marshall, your contributions are truly appreciated. I delved into this hobby because of your influence and even launched my own channel inspired by yours. While my fascination with watches began in childhood, it's thanks to you that I now engage in the meticulous processes of cleaning and servicing them. A few weeks ago, I created a video featuring a Captain Willard's Seiko, inspired by your content on the same watch, and it turned out wonderfully. Since the day I fixed it, the watch has been consistently running, and I've been proudly wearing it every day. It not only looks fantastic but also maintains excellent timekeeping. Once again, a heartfelt thank you for your dedication to the watch enthusiasts' community. Eagerly anticipating your upcoming videos!
3 videos in a month! You're spoiling us 😊
stunning watch and video, I nearly dropped my cup of  tea lol
bloody fantastic Marshall i saw a old Bugatti  of watches and have you seen the Bugatti Watch with the fully working w16 motor ?? its on you tube mate  Enjoy mate it will blow your mind
I wonder if Rolex would have been interested in restoring this watch?
This is the infamous lawsuit watch. Where someone sued rolex for supposedly radiation poisoning their family from this very watch . The bezel being the main offender . Rolex did a product recall and got most of these early gmt’s and replaced the bezel with a non luminous one. Supposedly the bezel  is strontium 90 based not radium. Fantastic work mate!
I normally don't care for the whole "Pepsi Bezel" Rolex but I love how dark the blue and the red are, its not as cartoonish as the other ones look like.
Is it me or is  Marshall shaking a bit more on this watch , i know i would be for the price of it.
The one and only👀
Nice job! Congrats! I have a doubt regarding the calendar wheel. It is supposed to be bi-color. Red for pair days and black for unpair days.
Look up 'Radium Girls' for insight about the dangers of Radium use.
Fantastic result.  Congratulations!
The radium dials were usually hand painted. The young women they got to paint were lied to and told it was safe. Were told to lick the end the brushed to get a sharp point. Their are a few documentaries on the subject. Called the radium girls. Also their were alot if radioactive products that were actually made and marketed to be healthy. Happy Thanksgiving yall. 😊
The obsession with the dial, crown etc, hilarious. I’d happily replace broken parts, the radioactive bezel for example. These watches have become obsessively worshipped. They are to tell the time and function, not to be talked about in terms of appreciation of cost like it’s exciting
i think im getting cancer just watching this :P
Always great videos :) Your site is nice with the kits, wished I had one of those when I started ;) Great effort to make easier the start of this great hobby. I learn so much watching your videos, Cheers from France
Love the videos, I am a WR addict.  Why don't you use wooden tweezers for everything, rather than just for the dial side stuff?
that a Rolls-Royce of a wristwatches nice one getting it back in to good working shape hope it runs for meany more years
Amazing video, the bezel alone is worth 30k+ but lots of issues with the rest of the watch. The dial is either entirely fake or poorly refinished, it should be gilt and have a chapter ring (appears to be glossy with white print?) and fonts are sloppy. The hands have also been re-lumed. The watch also would have come with a roulette date wheel.
No pressure!😊
I was wondering, are there poly gaskets available instead of rubber?  I could imagine how the right polyurethane could last longer, just like bushings for sports cars. Maybe I'm incorrect, though.
What a nice find! Kinda hard to get your head around the fact that these are still being "found in drawers".. :)  I do wonder what would happen with this one if the owner had sent it in to Rolex. I know they like to replace (and then keep) parts like the hands or dial - especially with radium-lumed watches, I guess. However: I wonder what they would do with the  bezel insert. Do they have replacement parts for that and, if so, would they be made from Bakelite? Maybe they wouldn't even take it in for repair/restoration because it's too old? Seeing how this looks like it's never been overhauled/messed with (it seems to have patina-ed very "evenly"), this has got to be a six figure Pussy Galore - which would make things quite difficult for me if it was my grandfather's. I'd be too scared to wear this one because of the Bakelite-insert. These were known to be brittle when those watches were new and the material probably doesn't get sturdier with age. Plus there'd be my own greed which, at this price, would probably outweigh any sentimentality... :)
Best yet, thank you!
Amazing Video as always and Please do a wrist watch check every video it would be nice to see.
Excellent work!
Nice watch it 4y younger then I am but I don’t think any of many watches will be worth so in years to come 😊
beautiful watch
Geeeez. This is "THE" Unicorn any ROLEX watch collector must have in their collection.
The sound of that Geiger counter is so scary, it's a good thing he put it aside...
Huge fan wish I could fix watches but I don’t have steady hands
Very nice work!
Reminds of an old Sandoz "submariner" I had back in the 80s. They don't make 'em like this no more
Hello my fellow night watchmen!
What makes it $100,000?
This watch is terrifying. I am surprised you even took on this challenge!
nice
I'd be interested to know who gave that valuation given it's condition and model #?.
Thanks for this Marshall, your videos are just what the world needs...
*1:15 AM, Los Angeles*  Welp better get ready for bed  *Marshall uploads*  Welp, better get some snacks for this restoration.
Happy thanksgiving! And so thankful that we got a new video on this day!
Ohhhhhh I'm so happy now. Thank-you Marshall.
Awesome restoration as usual.  I hope your hands don’t start glowing!
Hello from Romania Sir,you are doing great work and you are a mentor for me,because of you i have started my hobby which i've been thinking about for a long time.God bless you and have a great day!
I wear a crappy $12 seiko and have no experience in watch repair, yet as soon as I see these new videos posted I click. Thank you marshall
Thanksgiving keeps giving.  Thanks Marshall!
I usually watch these at night before bed, but as soon as I saw what this was, I had to click play immediately! Watching now, just had to say that!
A radioactive bakelite non-runner. This will be interesting!
Love the Gmt
Wo 😮
Let's go! Happy thanksgiving!
Hey Marshal! I really love your videos!   I would love to see you clean up a Citizen by0005-01e ecodrive ... I have this watch and I would be so curious to see the insides.
Oh woow what a great watch great to see you again man
Let's go!
good timing
Oh wow…. This is very very exciting. I am nervous for you haha
omg its just like all the other watches
yee
