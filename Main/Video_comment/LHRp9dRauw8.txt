Just Heard Dance Gavin Dance is Dropping a new album July 2026 called "Instant Traumatization" should hear a public announcement any day now
If you love Dance Gavin Dance like i do or NF check out my Post Hardcore Cover of NF-FEAR.. I think its awesome and addicting like DGD. Help me to get it to go viral! https://youtu.be/y8OGA9u4w3A?si=Bv4BkAjtwR3z43rj
I love the band that Will, Jon and Matt have made for themselves.
Jon Mess, and Will Swan are the actual hearts and souls of this band.
The bassist of this band is so underrated
This song fn bangs
This song is a straight banger. I've been listening to it on repeat ever since I first heard it. I miss the Jonny Craig days but this whole album slaps
Tilian, come back :(
Dress code: lost and found box
Lyrically, this is one of the best songs y’all ever wrote 🥹 the song as a whole is a bop, but something about these lyrics from top to bottom fortifies that tiny twinkling light inside my eyes 😍😂
holy chin
3:04 Don't care about ass-ass, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
I do be dancing to that messy chorus.
This is one of my fav songs but the neueotypicals dont agree.
Tilian & Tim 😢
Another night!
This entire album is amazing. From the grooves of the bass, to Jon’s trademark out of pocket lyrics. And as someone who has an affinity for drumming but am  by no means a professional at it, the drum lines of DGD have always pulled me and this album was no exception to that. I’ll admit I’ve listened to the album on repeat multiple times and I’m disappointed I didn’t know about its release until 2 years after the fact even though I’ve been a fan since 2017.
I feel betrayed as a fan, for never getting to see this live 👀
Jons little dancing really does it for me in this one
Ya'll fucked up getting rid of Tilian
5 big booms for the ladies 2:22
This doesn't sound like DGD 😢
Laci Baldwin if youre reading this i miss you, but i know youre doing well.
I swear Jon the most chill looking guy ever I'm still shock he the screamer in the band
The drums kills in the beginning ❤❤
I love this fucking song, what the fuck
grrrr I ha8 dance Gavin dance grrr 😖
I had a breakup turn me off of this band that I’d listened too since a kid, but just hearing this song for the first time and Jon Mess just cant miss, dude just keeps getting better.
Mandible clamper is just brilliant
tilian era going out with a banger
NGL, thought Tillian was wearing a bathrobe until he got outta the pool
I love everything about this song! Way2go u guys!
When did Flea start singing ?
If, at the end of it all, it turns out that Tim and Tillian era was the peak of DGD, I will still have countless amazing songs to carry me till the end of days.    But I am both sad and hopeful for this next chapter.
When people say the pre-Tilian era of DGD was better I have to think that person is some special kind of ret@rd.
i really like this song but the weird effect on the voice irks me for some reason,  like the parts where he says "whoa, were alive" and  "is your soul" everything else is amazing idk why it bothers me so much the rest of the song makes it so i cant help but listen again and again
I just realised this is the last music video with this line up, DGD at their absolute prime
I’m convinced that DGD are actual musical geniuses. This new album was on a God level. Their sound is so interesting and beautiful
Idk I think this is my favorite some by them. Something about the vibe, the time it was released, the emotions I was having at the time and everything else going on in the world. I think this is my #1 DGD song because of all the things. Plus it’s a fucking BOP!
Jon atteee
Jon cracks me up in the video.
so good
This Song hit me in such a specific way  i totally understand the title lol fuckin love it 😂
first time listening to one of their new songs, im a fan from the early 2000’s and just wasn’t interested in hearing the new stuff, this sounds way different.
Jon is perfection this whole video 😂
Still a banger
I like to practice my singing and vocal cord muscles by singing along to DGD songs and trying to hit all the voices (my regular range used to be more along the lines of Andrew Wells’ baritone). not only has my screaming vastly improved but I can also swear that I can sing along to Tilian AND Jon at the same time at the last chorus…  then again I AM stupid high and still sad after sex
amazing song cpr in the video is really shitty quality tho... y'all make sure to compress 2" for an adult ok? kisses!
smoooth then Jon Comes.. in Oh wait why am I in hell?.. oh well its still smooth
I love how from 2:05-2:12, Jon is just playing with the pool noodle while Tilian is singing..!
Before I actually read the lyrics, at 1:41 I used to think he said horny man... Lol
My girlfriend and i have a theory that Jon is actually a rapper who just screams his vocals instead of trying to rap them and his verses in this song are him talking to himself in an acid trip. It just makes so much sense when you put it all together
best song ever
I love john so fuckin much lol
JON HITTING NOTES, LEGEND
This song hits different on some shrooms! Let’s Dance!!! 💃
rest easy Tim
This album is the best thing since the mountain 2 and it's so reminiscent of the first 2 full lps
I love the devil vs angel fighting on your shoulders trade off they have. This band really holds out on unique sounds
omg i love the top of the girl in the beginning where did she get it
Can we change vocalist already ?
this is some hot garbage
I can’t believe he wore a jacket that small in this video🤦‍♂️
Good times good tunes 😊 im proud
After 11 months I've finally watched the video.. It took me some time knowing its the last time we'd see Tim jamming out. Really gave me the biggest set of chills I've ever had... Made me smile so big & some tears even ran down.. Dance Gavin Dance has & will always have a place in my heart. Sadly I never had the chance to see them live w/Tim 😭🥺 i love this band.. my #1 for life...& I'm not capping. 💞🔥🖤🎶😍🗣️  We miss you Tim. 🥺💞💞
There are some DGD songs I restart right after listening to, this is one of them
В этом определённо что то есть
Awesome, but previous albums were better
Sal Vulcano did it first.
🤘
Sophia Black you are fireeeee
Eshaa essss
Really wish jon would incorporate more melody into his screaming like he did here. Sounds really good
Rip Tim ❤
John mess aka Mr wiggle
Is that Aaron form the amity affliction @ 2:43????
Damm, Jon really carries the band these days.
I seen this live 2 months ago. SOOOO GOOOOOD. It was even better live!
wtf is this
Sounds bad man
Not surprised how kosher they’ve become
Very cringe 😬
This is a really good song
Mess goes off on this song, coming back to it for the first time in months and wow...Kills is on this track
Love you Tim! ❤
I could swear they're saying "excess snow" instead of " answers no" I swear it.
When you're a boob guy - "We don't care about asses, no!"
I listened to this while on edibles yesterday and bruh... this might be one of my all time favorite DGD songs now. DGD is putting out some of their best stuff and Tillian is a perfect fit. This song and video is a perfect vibe for our time/scene right now.
THIS SONG IS LEGENDERRRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I fucking love Tilian
Whoa, you're alive Do you ever really stop and wonder why? Is your soul fortified By the tiny twinkling light inside your eyes? Whoa, another night Should you live with your regrets or just get high? Feels bad man The up and down of the emotion broke my loading hands Replaced my legs with sleepy pants They make me smoke 50 grams I don't pander, mandible clamper, setting a standard You can't touch my precious glow I don't care about answers, no Tell yourself a story, life is pretty boring See you in the morning, let your worries drown Like chlorine, keep the liquor pouring Flap until you're soaring, let your heroes down Well, I think I've seen enough But I hoped this trip would come and save me My life ain't bad enough So I scratch this itch, incinerate me Heart pours the core of my flex, the lord in my step The organ, it plays through Time blows the horn in my chest, I'm boarding my jet The plane that I came to Brain brimming through a sea of bats They're nipping chords and spinning webs of rhythm as they flap Are you decalcified but stupid high, still sad after sex? Did you realize that all this time your crown was just a hat? Whoa, soul divine Is there anything out there to dull your shine? Bump, bump, bump, bump, boom, ten hundred times 'Til one day you wake up and you feel alright Bump, bump, bump, bump, boom, ten thousand times 'Til one day you wake up and you're outta time Feels bad man The up and down of the emotion broke my loading hands Replaced my legs with sleepy pants They make me smoke 50 grams I don't pander, mandible clamper, setting a standard You can't touch my precious glow I don't care about answers, no Don't care about answers Don't care about answers, no You can't touch my precious glow I don't care about answers, no Don't care about answers, no.
jon is literally so talented, top 3 screamer in my opinion
This is Jon's album.
good song
Now that's heavy...
This is the band is calling out and crying out. Rest in peace and welcome back Tilian.
May as well be a tillian solo project this band now. Jon is a backing vocalist at best these days
I saw them live in London on the 14th of this month. Amazing, the best mosh pits I've ever been in. They didn't play much of their recent album, I would've loved to hear this live, probably my favourite song of the album, such a bop.
The person being resuscitated has me fucked up.
Which one is tim ?
Thank you, Tim.
I think I’m gonna be Jon for Halloween next year from this music video.
My Head: Tillian: “Don’t care about answers, no” Jon: “Don’t care about ass or snow”
holy fuck this is sick ?!?!!
Funny how this was tillian's last single lol
The clean vox on top of screams with Tillian and Jon at the end is SO good. Also, RIP Tim, you are so, so missed.
I love how so many DGD songs are an opera leading up to the final EPIC ballad to close it out. It's a fucking journey that you can't help but feel.
FeelsBadMan PepeHands
Folks, who knows what kind of dance Tilian does? I tried to find , but no success. Some interesting moves which I’d like to learn somehow 😅
Jon is so entertaining I keep rewatching for him BAHA
I hear "well I think I've seen enough..." And black platform thigh high leather boots materialize on my legs and I Walk.
3:07 - that’s all
You can't touch my precious glow 😍 fav line. Been screaming it since this song came out
Til one day you wake up and you feel alright   Til one day you wake up AND YOU'RE OUT OF TIME FEELS VAD MAN TIM MAN  THESE GUYS GIVE NO F ABOUT ANSWERS
Got dam, Jon really tryna break thru my hart n gib me dem feels huh? Wit dat 90s aesthetic, got me all HNNNNNNGGGGGHHH
This is the first time I’ve heard of this band. lol no wonder why everyone makes fun of this shit lmaooooo. What even is this? The video is even cringe as well 😬
#feelsbadman
Omg they have a song named after the emote
Tilian can be dressed in anything and still look fine as hell.
So, it’s a “TV thought” to go be rockstars  So, “independent creativity” and “making dreams real” are the TV?
A perfect song.
best song on the album imo
Jon Mess truly is my spirit animal. I really wish that he was given the same type of praise that Tilian gets. I feel like sometimes he ends up being a bit unfairly overshadowed. Realistically, while being drastically different vocal styles and deliveries, Jon’s ability is just as other worldly and wholly unique as Tilian’s. Personal note: As a recovering alcoholic myself, I’m really proud of Tilian for publicly acknowledging his struggles, as well as dealing with it head on. It takes a lot of courage for everyday folks, let alone someone who’s life is lived in a very public way.
I'm a big fan of unclean vocals...and I've been underrating Jon Mess for years.  The man chose the perfect time to come with everything he's got. Dance Gavin Dance is going to be ok no matter what
we. need. more. Jon.
I can't  believe that Tillian forces himself and his little tiny penis on women.  Fucking gross man, I hope it ain't so. People who rape other people are fuckin disgusting and tbh I can't support a band that supports rape
Bring tillian person back!!!
Is it just me or does Jon look like Jamie Kennedy?
good thing tillian is back
I feel personally attacked
Anyone else see a connection between Good Charlotte’s “I Just Wanna Live” and this song/album. Jon’s parts here reminded me of GC’s song and in the IJWL video they’re dressed up as fruits and vegetables.   Probably unrelated and a stretch but I just like the possibility since I grew up on GC and love DGD.
im 15 again!
This song is boring
fucking bangers only
Kinda mid, ngl. I guess not everything can be a banger.
Bump, bump, bump, bump, boom 💥🤯
MISS YOU TIM </3
i am commenting on my moms account but I LOVE TILIAN!!!!!!!! BRING HIM BACK!
Meh the screaming parts kill the song
Tilian is on another level now. I also think Jon's screaming has never been better!
The bass line in this song is so awesome. RIP Tim.
Bring back this lineup 😭😭 I miss all the boys
Such a low effort video The super cheap VHS filter could be done better on an iphone Also their songs are a little too poppy now Not much soul or heaviness  Tillian isnt nowhere near as good as Craig
there's no accounting for taste
I am in love with Jon mess and dan wolfson
I am in love with Jon mess
TILLIAN HELP
TILLIAN
I know I'm going to upset the DGD fanboys on this one, but this band would be next level legendary without the screaming.
I love this song, but it could’ve been so much better leaving out the screaming parts. Or not make them so long
I find peace in Jon's incoherent ramblings....
I cant get over john Mess his rhythm always gets me
thought it was don't care a bout ass holes lmao I love getting inforemd in front of my pc lyrics wall thank you for always putting your lyrics up btw.
I love this band so freaking much; I just wish their front men would have keep their hands to themselves.  R.I.P Tim Feerick
If you like Midwest post-hardcore emo shit I wrote a song that sound like Satyr, Dance Gavin Dance and Hail the Sun had a swan baby, please check it out I have more originals coming and vocal covers posted! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaQvKiYFwlM
1:27 👏👏
Secret Band LP3 confirmed!!!!🎉
wtf is this
You can't touch my precious glow~
This looks like a balenciaga add
John looks great in this music video. I love it! :D
The way Jon and Tilian rift at the end is just pure magic, I swear I listened to this song like 10x on repeat..... Let me just play it one more time lol
people still listen to this crap..?
Dude. God fucking damn.
tim .... sad noises
I know Trilian can go high, but the autotune is ridiculous.
Did Tilian put on Will's jacket?
This is the last video of the boys, before everything went to shit.
Why is Jon just SO good??
La intro es tan fresca que puedo sentir el vibe en la piscina 😎🙃
FeelsBadMan
I hope Tillian comes back eventually
My favorite song of the album!
as a bass player, I listen to most of the DGD tracks for Tims bass lines. he was such a ripper. great song!!
I wonder who will replace Tillian? He has a good voice but so have the last two singer for dgd, if anyone can find a replacement singer it’s dance Gavin dance :)
Tbh with this music video, I would imagine Jon wearing a bunch of winter gear bc he's just like that
I love how this gives you the feel of a 90’s pool party
Jon put his whole Messussy in this album
I used to dress like Jon mess does in this video back in 2006-2008
I’ve been listening to dgd since 2006 and honestly, fuck em
DGD always kills IT🔥🔥
John Mess is quickly becoming by favourite human being.
I don't think we realize how special this album is going to feel in a couple years.   This is the last we will hear of Tim's absolutely groovin' bass. The first album the band got to show off their hugely talented new singer and guitarist, Andrew Wells. Jon Mess is on a whole other level with this tone and rhythm this whole album (would never expect less). Swan has cranked the funk on full blast.   Who knows how the Tilian situation will end up, but a whole lot will change with the band moving forward from this album. I really don't wanna name their golden album just yet, but damn this is so good, it's hard to imagine it getting better. I have hope for the band moving forward. I haven't been this invensted in a band since Pink Floyd, and I'm sure DGD will continue growing from such an absolute smasher album. Feels good man!
This songs killer they still got it
Man, I've never seen a party I wished I could be at more than this one
Bump bump bump  bump boom
Fuck man, don't you just love these guys?
Откуда у Тиллиана пиджак Стаса Барецкого?!
That guitar is so heavenly
Is it just me or is this song about post nut depression?
Tilian: Should you live with your regrets or just get high?  Me:  Definitely both.
Fucking love this video! Looks like it was alot of fun making it
Fucking love this video! Looks like it was alot of fun making it
Man I'm gonna miss Tim so much, his bass lines were always so tight
Estoy 100% seguro de que si esta canción hubiese salido en los early 00's, cuando MTV era "EL canal de música", hubiera cambiado el rumbo de todo lo que conocemos hoy en día sobre la industria musical.
RIP. Tim put his whole foot in the groove.
Bring back Tillian!
This song is so incredible! And this clip! My favorite music now🖤

maximum jacket please
No matter what happens, DGD will still be a near and dear band to me  Even if the second Tillian allegation is true and his reputation is tarnished, I will still honor this band for creating art and generally making all of our days better
Rise no borres mis comentarios pues!!! hahahahaha
alohaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Must be nice.
Did anyone else notice the beginning of this track kinda sounds like the beginning of “heat of the moment” by Asia ?
Damn I forgot how much I missed new stuff from them
HELLO!!!!!
"well don't care about incest now" - Jon Mess
DGD been listening to you since the release of DTBM 1. You’ve been there for me through breakups, heartache and depression. Please stay here for us. I love you and am so glad I found you 14+ years ago on my iPod touch lol.
After seeing Jon do the smiling during the videos (betrayed by the game, strawberrys wake) while his screaming verses were playing seeing this video where he looks pissed was awesome. Can't tell which I like more
So funky
aun vengo a diarioooooo mi perro!!!
Thank you Jon for always teaching me new vocabulary that I would never use 😂❤️
Gonna miss you Tim, thank you for this gift on your way to a much deserved rest. Your music really is a piece of history waiting to be discovered by future treasure hunters. Love you man.
Hot damn. Vocals + BAND. killin it...
Tilian.. Will wants his jacket back.
Mmmmmmm🙏❤❤❤💃💃💃
Been a fan since the self title release! Every album brings me back to moments growing up. I really love this song, and I’m sorry but I just found myself not being able to support this record. Because of tilian, and that really sucks. It’s like being disappointed in your friend.
I switch my headphones around during different listens so each of my ears gets an equal dose of the guitars
Okay, first time hearing this and I swear they were saying, “Don’t care about incest, no” 😂
Hope Tillian comes back soon!
X100000000000000
Rest Easy Tim. You will be missed.
otro día otra repetición mis perros!!!!
This band is a Paradise
Sweet Jesus this song is such a bop.
god Jon looks so hot
eshaaa essss!!!
Also probably this will be the last video with Tilian and Tim 😢
Top 3 of my favorite songs of jackpot juicer.
i dont think i love my lil dog as much as i love jon mess. hes a god

100 views are just from me 😂
Gavin approved. 😁 Feelsgoodman. RIP Tim 😔 Feels Bad Man.
This song is a true standout from the rest of the album, for me personally...while Jackpot is pretty fire start to finish, this song is the one that keeps me hitting refresh to hear it again. The music video just adds a whole other layer of greatness to an already badass track! This showcases to me that DGD isn't about Tilian, isn't about John,  isn't about Will but about them as a whole creating kick ass funky jams for us to rock out to!
shit tilian fucked up and left the band..this sucks
screamo guy do well
This is the most California video ever.
I listen to this song at least thrice a day and it still gets better every single time. I love this band so fucking much ❤️
My god Tilian has the voice of an angel
Jon looks very 2002
Nice contrast of singing styles . That lead vocalist sings really good , good song.
his dancing at 1:30 kills me
Anybody else notice that the guy shouting looks like a cat in disguise?
Jonh e Tilian são incomparáveis!
god i love jon
Jon is the best
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🤘🤘
Will always be here for the Mess
https://youtu.be/CrDKcbpFPZM #dgd #dancegavindance #jackpotjuicer #review
normally when i sleep amazon send me commericals to look at through my dream and i decide to think what plauisble and what couldnt happen  cool song overall keep up with the content creation
Fuck I love this song
this is awful...... i imagine this what hell sounds like.
Absolute banger, no surprise there. Like everyone else said, bass line really makes this track. Too funky
Is tillian coming back or what
You know, Matt’s drums is pure fire.
Tilian got Yeezys 😂
Don't care about excess snow
Jon is the type of dude I aspire to be on camera. He is his own dude.
Good God Wow! I’m crying over how good this is. Love love love love love!!!
We miss you, Tim. Watching you vibe warmed my heart
Between this and betrayed by the game the moral is:  If you're having a good time with the Bois  You're gonna die
So much love for the boys❤
Good vibes ❤️
Does anyone know where I can find Jon's shirt I want it
Jon mess❤️
Jon's flow in this song is hard 🔥
I don't care about ass and snow!
This has always been Jon and Will's Band. It will always be so. Please Vishnu let's not for Matt.
The tandom licks of Andrew and Will on this track and incredible. They compliment each other SO well. Just like Tilian, Jon and Andrew. This track is such a banger.
Another banger of an album to listen to right through. Heck yes. On repeat for the next two months.  I think so.
LMAO John's face first pool dive reminds me of the Every Time I Die video for "The New Black"
Jon Mess at his PRIME, ladies and gentlemen
Glad Tilian’s gone
Jon mess is my hero
Jon mess def took dance lessons from Tilian 😂
I miss Tim everyday, this album has such a bittersweet energy so many things have happened within a year and still they were able to incapsulate everything they are or ever will be as a band.  10/10
just broke out some of their older music from when i was a teen, didnt know they were still putting out new stuff
Yikes bro Tilian is corny af
New rock music is still alive. Great song and album
different styles or not Kurt Travis and Jonny Craig are far better leads then tilian was or ever will be. Rest of the crew in DGD hold it down besides him. dudes garbage.
Love DGD with TILIAN! Please come back fo the EUROPEAN TOUR...! Pleaseeeeeee...!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻
oh my god.
Wow I knew they were real about bringing news to the table but this is literally from my thoughts as well. Perfect song and it literally makes me wish I had people I could relate to like this.. this song is enough tho for now.. thanks for the amazing music guys. Expected nothing less but damn this is fire...
OHHH... I thought they said "I don't care about incest now"😬
Favorite song from JJ.
I can’t stop listening to this fucking sonnnnggggg ! 💕
song of the year for me
Nothing will ever stop me fucking adoring this band. Top work yet again boys ❤️
This is probably one of the favs from the album as I listen to it more.   Two secret weapons is really cool, the verse lyrics are really good but the chorus lyrics feel really rushed, best instrumental track probably though.   You can hear alot of the tracks are just evolved versions of the older songs, and I like that
FC From Thailand. 🤘🇹🇭🤘
When he said "bump bump bump bump boom", I felt that.
For those of us who’ve been here a minute “till one day you wake up, and your out of time”, just hits a little different. RIP TIM AND ALL THE GREAT ONES WEVE LOST ALONG THE WAY
The way he says your crown was just a hat kills me I love it
this whole albumb is describing xqc and twitch. feelsgoodman is a emote on twitch, and the xqc is known for gabling on twitch and his nick name is the "juicer" and the other song "one mans cringe" . and "long nights in jail" is a gta rp reference
Johns section from 1:25 - 2:05 was absolutely bonkers! He absolutely nailed it, one of my favourite tracks from him so far
Christian really did amazing work with this video 👏🏼👏🏼🔥
I have zero doubts jon can scream exactly the same way he moves mouth in this video
I'm glad they ended the song with letting us know that they "don't care about inceset now"
Jon strutting up to the mic is just too good haha
Its hard to listen to Dgd after the truth about tillian came out
If you kick out Tilian over some ho, I will shit on your band forever.
Damn Jon rocking that Y2K sense of fashion with the short sleeve over the long sleeve
At first I thought it was Westbrook singing in the pool. Maybe it's just me.
Such a smooth and bangin' track
Tillian is innocent
Here before it gets old :)
Song would be a lot better without those horrible cleans. Everything else is fine, but the cleans are just plain annoying and they singlehandedly ruin the song.
Anyone else die laughing when John starts his strut to the mic? Shit kills me everytime.
Jon’s flow is everything.
It does feelbadman
Блять ахуенно.
My life ain’t bad enough so I scratch this itch INCINERATE ME
omg..OMGOMGOMG...omg. At this moment this is my everything
Don't care about ass *OR* snow.
Am I the only person who misheard the lyric as "We don't care about asses, no"?
1000 coment
I think for me this is the peak of DGD so far, I’m amazed at how incredible Jackpot Juicer’s been, they never fail to one up themselves every damn album
They fit the 90’s vibe too well. I’m enjoying the end of the tillian era though. I know they’ll keep on keeping strong but what a solid core this was for the last few years.
I love this song and I love Tillian in DGD. But that Color Me Bad jacket has to go.
This is my favorite song on the album. That bass line is funky as fuck.
Which one is Jon you guys? I'm new here high pitched or raspy screamo?
One last banger to go out on..
didn't the singer get in trouble for sexual harassment earlier this year?
0:18 when you bump into a friend in public that you haven't seen in a while
I thought Tillian said "Fap until you're soaring". Until I read the lyrics
Love that the kept the subtle click of the drum sticks being set down in the track at 3:13. Intentional or not, very cool.
*Whoa*    You're alive.
Can we all agree who the star of this is
This year's Grammy winners should be Spiritbox, Wage War, and Dance Gavin Dance, not Dinosaurs like Foo Fighters and ACDC.
a dead druggie, someone who committed multiple acts of sexual assault, and an alcoholic walk into a bar....oh wait, no. they walk into a concert venue. it's DGD. LOLOLOLOLOL LMFAO ROFLMAO ROFL MY LOL0L0L0L0L
Definitely a party of a lifetime 🤣
The bass on this album is fantastic 😢
Jon pulling his best hip gyrations as a tribute to every live Tilian performance 😂
The ending of this song 🔥🔥🔥
Literally heard fap until you're sorry, had to check
I had a rough mental health day yesterday and heard this song for the first time. I’m obsessed with it. Very relatable and inspiring and I very much needed it
This is the most DGD video I’ve ever seen  Also, Jon Mess is like a fine wine
I’m in love with all these Jon characters  Edit: and Tillians jacket deserves better 😂.
Jon Mess is my spirit animal
🥰
Andrew has a bulbasaur on his shirt
Tim fucking killed it on this album, bass is slappin
Yung Dub D the rap sensation checking in
Jon
I love Tim laughing on Jon at 2:52
This song is catchy except for the creepy clean pop vocal part that jumps past Claudio Sanchez-tolerable to auto-tuned Kiss-FM cringe. Otherwise, this might be their best effort in a catalogue that after 5 songs you have heard all they have in their repertoire.
0:45 is just amazing
Last video with Tim and probably Tillian… feels bad man 😥
FeelsBadMan Jack Pot Juicer, NO SHOT squadW
Love the video but this is the weakest track on the album for me personally. This and Synergy. I hope they make a video for Polka Dot or One Man's Cringe
This video is so 90s and I love it
Tillian... come on dudes don't let the cancel culture kills it, he obviously didn't abused anyone, fix this.
Danee Gavin Danee
Feels Bad Man
This album is something special and honestly haven't felt this hyped and so far blow away by the singles put out since Mothership. Absolutely special.
to be honest i don't think they gave jon a script for this video. they just gave him the premise and told him to have fun
Lets just say it this is AOTY and well DGD best album to date. Tilian is life man, jon is life man, this band is life.
The last line makes me hit replay everytime
Fuck, this songs amazing
Just back for my daily dose of this video
3:06 this is very beautiful
Can't. Stop. Listening. Fuccccckk!
Finally, Jon’s era!!! Never a bad song from these guys but, Jon in this album is *chefs kiss*
You have to respect that these guys came together one last time and realized they’re only human
God damn, Jon shines in this one!
Tim 😭
1:19 = "ring around the rosie"; you're welcome
Verse 1: Tilian] Whoa, you're alive Do you ever really stop and wonder why? Is your soul fortified By the tiny twinkling light inside your eyes? Whoa, another night Should you live with your regrets or just get high?  [Chorus: Jon Mess] Feels bad man The up and down of the emotion broke my loading hands Replaced my legs with sleepy pants They make me smoke fifty grams I don't pander, mandible clamper, setting a standard You can't touch my precious glow I don't care about answers, no  [Post-Chorus: Tilian] Tell yourself a story, life is pretty boring See you in the morning, let your worries drown Like chlorine, keep the liquor pouring Flap until you're soaring, let your heroes down  [Verse 2: Jon Mess] Well, I think I've seen enough But I hoped this trip would come and save me My life ain't bad enough, so I scratch this itch, incinerate me Heart pours the core of my flex, the lord in my step The organ it plays through Time blows the horn in my chest, I'm boarding my jet The plane that I came to Brain brimming through a sea of bats They're nipping chords and spinning webs of rhythm as they flap Are you decalcified but stupid high? Still sad after sex? Did you realize that all this time, your crown was just a hat?  [Bridge: Tilian] Whoa, soul divine Is there anything out there to dull your shine? Bump bump bump bump, boom Ten hundred times 'Til one day you wake up and you feel alright Bump bump bump bump, boom Ten thousand times 'Til one day you wake up and you're out of time  [Outro: Jon Mess, Tilian, Jon Mess & Tilian] Feels bad man The up and down of the emotion broke my loading hands Replaced my legs with sleepy pants They make me smoke fifty grams I don't pander, mandible clamper, setting a standard You can't touch my precious glow I don't care about answers, no Don't care about answers Don't care about answers, no You can touch my precious glow I don't care about answers, no Don't care about answers, no
Jon looks like the lead singer of glass animals.
Jon Mess is my spirit animal
Rip Tim, thanks for all the great music, you will be missed brother! Hearts out to the band members and family.  What an amazing album, congratulations guys!
This music should be illegal, but God allowed it. Bring Tilian Pearson back or I won't listen. You can't replace a voice.  RIP Tim, you blessed the band. Every member push themselves beyond their limits. I knew this album would be good, but it was better than I expected. No other music has affected my life like DGD. There really is a God:)
I love this song!!! I played it all day!!
Feels Good, man, when DGD drops a whole ass album and every song is god tier
Just seeing Tim in this makes me tear up
One of a funky rock masterpiece from this band feels bad man that Tim isn't here anymore. R.I.P Tim Feerick
Everybody fucking killed it on this album holy shit
Rest in peace Tim the bass is sick in this
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢 dodged
Remember kids, never drink the Kool-Aid.
I thought they would dedicate the video to Tim :/
Is your soul fortified, by the tiny twinkling light inside your eyes? 💕
Rip Tim <3 :(
FeelsBadMan 🐸☹
I absolutely love the whole vibe of this song.
Jon's dance moves 😍
Hearing some I The Mighty vibes on the intro and it doesn’t bother me AT AAAAAAAAALL
That Eminem - Yellow brick Road flow from jon mess tho lol so random.
I'm old enough to have seen all three clean front men. Tillian Era. Best Era.
Masterpiece
WTAF? HELLOOOOOOOO ITS bEEN AT LEAST AN ENTIRE DAY NOW SINCE THE TARGET VERSION HAS bEEN RELEASED. WHERE TF IS THE INSTRUMENTAL RIP? ANYONE, ANYWHERE? HELOOOOOOO LO LO LO LO. I want to actually listen to this album?!?!?!
Jon went god mode on this song. His flow is awesome. This track is 🔥
Eerily true to the band. Whole audience could die and management would force them to keep playing.
Not gonna lie as bad as this sounds! Tilians mishap is the best thing to happen to this band to weed out all the untrue fans to this band including the quote on quote "Tilian fan girls." They are only gonna go up form here! Now we can get back on track! This is by far how the last two albums should have sounded!!!! This is fucking god tier!
Funny how Will and Andrew look like 2 dudes that actually live at the house, then 4 other crazy mfs just started jamming with them.
Wondering how will DGD look now with Johnny Craig still
It’s great to see Tim again. This may be his last video and it’s nice to see him with his DGD fam having a good time. After this, it’ll be different but we will never forget his energy and music.  Forever will be missed Tim!
How is the whole album this good? How did Jon do the things?
☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️ https://youtu.be/L5s4fSu8YhI
I'm pretty sure I've listened to this at least 30 times today.
So good 🔥🔥🔥
jon doing his lil dancey dance 💕💕
Oh shit, Jon was cosplaying me in high school. Spot on brother!
Fuck tilian & bring Jonny back, he sounds 10x better w dgd than tilian ever did 🤷‍♂️
Bring Johnny back. Jesus.
I just love how Jon is doing the unclean vocals without even trying. That's how good he is 😂
FEELS BAD MAN
I used to have a job at a calendar factory but I got the sack because I took a couple of days off.
Big Edward Norton vibes circa Fight Club from Jon in this video.
He was gonna have lobster arms. They couldn't key out the green. You can tell.
Jon lookin fly af in this video lmao
I needed this.
So sad watching this now after Tim's passing. R.I.P one of my favorite bass players ever. Hope everyone in DGD is doing okay. This album is fucking spectacular and somehow they just keep getting better and better. Fucking I love y'all.
I think I’ve listened to this song a thousand times today lol
Deadly fire!! 🔥🔥
Jon's energy on this album is immaculate, song's, videos, bts, this man is in his bag.
It should be a national holiday when this band posts a new music video
This band is a 3 for 1.. The past, present and future all at once tied together like a nice holiday bow 🎁
I know the guy with the squirtgun and pool noodle 😎😎 my boy Tommy
that bass grooves so hard, long live Tim.
FeelsBadMan AlienPls3
luv it
thank you for blessing our ears
Awesome 😘🙌🏻
i’m a dj who aims to spread joy through house/chill dance music - would love if you could check out my most recent mix  https://youtu.be/gAJQl3tOqso :)
Tim fukken slays on this one.
Ouch.
Now THIS is the album single
Absolutely love the wide variety of dorky dancing presented by both Jon and Tilian.
Videographer crushed this🔥. Groovy track by DGD too.
I've loved Jon for years now but him on this song absolutely blew my mind he's passed any expectations I've ever had for him.
It makes me so happy to see Tim with his final work. I just wish they cut Tilian out of the video.
the jon mess fit is immaculate on levels i cant comprehend
Jon is killing it as always, but this video is a-whole-ass-nother level. Jon's dancing? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  Now, to memorize the choreography and start doing the Mess at the club.
🌊 🐴
Anyone else think the album is so long because they had a few saved for the next album and can't use them on that one now because tillian is prob leaving for good 😭
I would've liked to hear that hook type thing about a third of the way through the song. Other than that, one kf my favs
I never heard simplicity this complex
Jon absolutely killed it on this album!
Will never get tired of Jons lip syncing
me after watching this: feels good man
R.I.P Tim, what a banger !
Some of Tilians catchiest melodies i've ever heard are on this album and Jon is killing it on every track. Incredible album!
This is incredibly amazing, seeing all those guys together. I wish it could stay that way, so they could make a lot of other awesome music
This song and video are so powerful it transcends space and time.
xqcl
So glad this mv start with Tillian singing while floating on the pool
Let's gooo constant bangers
Will and Matt are seriously so ridiculously talented. If it weren't for them, this album would be a major stinker
Seriously? No one has gone to target and come home and ripped the instrumental and upped it online yet? HELLO?!? WHERE IS THE INSTRUMENTAL PLEASE!!!
why is everyone constantly getting poisoned on dgd music videos? lol
3:08 i just love when dgd does this, all the layers meet and you get beautiful sound! this song is immaculate, i'm a sucker for 2010s indie sounding guitars, and once again swan deliveried it! this year got so much better with this new album and royal coda's new singles.  got to see dgd live here in my hometown in Brazil, and it was the best show i have ever been to, hopefully they come to Curitiba once again. amazing energy (or should i say synergy lol) keep up the good work guys!!!
Can we forgive Tilian so he can come back
I've been listening to you guys since 2007 and just wanted to say thank you, from the bottom of my heart for keeping the soul of this band alive. This song is incredible and the entire album feels like a true gift to long time fans.
jon when he😍😍😍
Should have been the closing track on the album.   I said what I said.
Oh my GOD SOO GOOOOOD 🙂🙃🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃🙃🙂
That short sleeve-long sleeve combo was the only way back in the day.
What feels bad is a bad mentality, because a bad mentality based on natural circumstances and feelings are worse for focus. Spirituality is a positive and focused mentality which feels good but is sacrifice.
Goddamn RIP Tim
nani what in tarnation lets gooooo
Wait. Did they poison everyone again?
HOOOOLY, THE BASS 😭
❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤
Bro Jon looks like the coolest 90s kid right now
I can only think in Pepe the frog with this title 🤣  Good song btw
:D :D This made my day!! Summer vibes indeed...DGD keep getting more and more exciting with every new album :D
Tillians 5 o’clock shadow makes him look dirty….
I love this band so much man, never fucking disappoints! 🤟🏻💕
The album is immaculate. Seeing Tim in this vid brought a tear….rip Tim…we lost another legend.
❤️
I love this so much
God, I just wish I could vibe as hard as Jon does.
This entire album slaps
THIS...new favorite.
So happy to see Tim one more time
These guys truly are a god send. Love the energy this album
Jon's screaming- 😡 Jon in music videos - 😀
They chain the wonders! The video clip killed me too, I love it. Hahaha We broadcast the song on our independent radio station <3
BRO I HAD NO IDEA THEY HAD A NEW ALBUM DROPPING!!!!!!!!! AAAAAHHHHHHHHHH  Ever since signing Tillian this band has been #1 !!
Jesus christ.
Keep soaring Tim, RIP
Album's out and here I am still waiting for my order to ship (Ordered April 21st). . .  😭
Vibecity
Why does that oversized red jacket bother me so much??
Can someone cut out the funky dancing Jon at 1:41 I think that would make a great gif
Пиджак у Стаса Борецкого спиздил
More like sounds bad man.
Dude Jon’s dancing is so divine
Love every single one of yall so much. Thank you thank you thank you for this album.
RIP TIM 😢
Love it absolutely 🥰🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
*starts watching* *checks playback resolution*
I definitely didn't listen to this for 8 hours while waiting on the album drop.
This really gives off the energy of “our singer gay raped a child so we had to kick him out and our bass player died of sepsis from a perforated colon” vibes.
Missing Tim!
But but... I happen to care about acid snow!
eshaaaa essssss
No dejan de sorprenderme, sin dudas los mejores 🔥
This is such a vibe.  First of all, matt has the best smile ive ever seen. So genuine and beautiful.   Jon, I could watch YOU watch paint dry. Get my drift? The  "🙄😑👨🏼‍🎤Nooo🙌😵‍💫😑" at the end is a whole mood.  And Tilians red blazer thats 4x too big is actually the best thing I've seen all year. Seriously. I better not catch anyone at the pool without one from now on. 👊🖕  This music video is just what I needed. It cured me of covid, got me out of debt, saved my marriage, telepathically gave me the winning lottery numbers & my boobs got bigger!!!! Thank you, DGD.  See you in Orlando! 🤘🖤 (Driving all the way there from north alabama just to see yall. Worth it)
Mantap jon mess
JON
Love how Jon is dressed in 90’s-00’s clothes 😄
Heck Yarsh
It isn’t Dgd if tillian isn’t there
Best band been listening since dtbm.  Absolutely love Dgd there catchy hooks and they way they mix all different styles together is mind blowing .
TILIAM!!!!! <3
Love you guys
s2
FeelsBadMan
The groove is insane
3 minutes guys
🤘😈      🎸
Are the screen dimensions meant to look like an old tube TV, this video is amazing vibes, the attention to detail is impeccable. RIP Tim, loving the bass lines here. Mr Mess is so powerful on this album.
Uhhh been having a hard day and this song is like a breath of fresh air. I sincerely adore these guys 🖤 This song just feels GOOD 👍🏾
good to see ya bro
Might just be the best album yet. I just uploaded a video about some DGD lore. Check it
Sad to know this is the last video we will ever have with Tim. Bittersweet to see & hear him groovin’ for one last time. #FeerickForever 🤘🏻❤️
RIP Tim
This band is perfect.
Random guy: *dying* Everybody else: Oh we vibin
Damn what a song. I started tearing up when I saw Tim. So happy this album is coming out still
God I miss Tim so much, he always had the groove the song needed. Rest in peace Tim 🙏
This is worse then the last one...
RIP Tim!!!!!
this man Jon just went up a whole level
This will be the best dance gavin dance album and I never thought I'd say that when mothership exists
God damn Tim made this one so groovy 💚
Album is called Jons Jackpot Juicer for a reason.
Like the title, but this song just isnt it fam.
Another fucking 1, luv every song
Always loved Mess's work in DGD, good to see him rise up in a band where the main frontman overstepped on him a bunch. However, so far the singles released aren't impressing me unfortunately. Even to the point where that unique DGD sound/experience seems to have dwindled some. Going to wait for the release to really pry into it and give it a 100% decision. After listening since the self titled, there seems to be a more mainstream feel that appeals to more people, but loses what got them there to begin with. I miss Mothership/Artificial Selection passion. This has really become just, pop rock.
You can't touch my precious glow, I don't care about answers now  That's gotta be the ultimate DGD self empowerment lyric
don't care about ants or snow
its the bump bump bump bump boom for me.
Ima going to squeeze dry this album like always do with these lads
Ohhhhh so that's what they look like.
Isn't this a twitch emote?
DGD 🙌🎧🔥
This album is going to slaughter me. I’m already dead. It’s all so freaking awesome
Jon is giving us Tilian hips and I’m so fucking here for it
Everything is so fucking amazing in this video. Tim's sweater is incredible. Jon's dances, everything damn.
Really melted my heart to see Tim groovin one last time. Very nice touch for your last drop before the whole album hits, boys. It was very refreshing to see you all partying having a good time, especially with Tim. Rest in peace man,  hope you're jammin with Mr. Lucker, Mr. Pavone, and Mr. Strnad, bet it's a hell of a record you're dropping in heaven.
David arquette/ Jon mess might be my favorite but the rat king is pretty close.
It’s fun to go from watching the new Lorna Shore video to the new DGD video and love both. So much good music.
Jon carried
Love at first Mess 😍
RIP Tim, last video with the legend. But remember, legends never die
✌️❤️💪⚡️
As a recovering alcoholic this one hit different 🥴
666
Jon will and matt are carrying now ❤️
Tilian is the only thing keeping this band relevant.
Tiiim
This is so different from anything else on their discography, and it's such a vibe. The music video is their best for this era!
Underwhelming
Jon’s energy is everything lol
Suena genial hasta para bailar
Cant even lie. I aint impressed
i spy will rockin that yellow flannel for fantano
This is going to be their best album yet i cant wait to hear it in full tomorrow!
is jon mess even real at this point ??? cause like HOW
RIP TIM!
How the opening chords sound like Japans school bell thing, absolutely love all melodies in this banger 🤘🤙
RIP Tim. Another incredible song from this album. Can’t wait for it to drop tomorrow
Anyone notice Jon looks like Sammy from Blue Mountain State in the video? 🤣
Once again Jon and Tim just out shine everything and stand out the most! My hype for this album is back
Another song I’ll be listening to on repeat.  Hopefully Tillian gets the help he needs.   I’m not sure who could replace that unique voice.
The first line of Born to Fail didn't lie 😁
Jon going off
This band deserves so much more recognition than they get. God bless Jon Mess. That man’s voice and style has aged like fine wine.
DGD has the impeccable ability to make the same style sound brand new every time the release something. I genuinely don’t think they’ll ever fall off in my eyes
ONLY BANGERS FROM NOW ON!!!
JON IS ABSOLUTELY EATING
My man killing it with the Lifeline from apex look. Nice bandana bruh. Might just be my favorite DGD song, fo real
Tillian literally sounds the same on every track.
So is Til back? Cause thus showed Jon can be a leading man. But it also  showed why the band needs Tik
please put this on instagram music 😍
god.  Every song has been great so far.  It’s weird to listen to this and enjoy it knowing Tillian is not gonna sing this album live.   I’m hoping he can get his shit together and rejoin the band at some point when the band is ready for him.   I just think this has been DGD best era.
Brooo Jon's KILLING THIS ALBUM.....
Oh this one here! So excited for tomorrow!!!
Like everyone else is saying, damn Jon is killing it in these recent songs! It's nice to see all of them together, I bet the video shoot was hella fun. DGD are such a unique band, one that I wish I'd gotten into sooner, but I was dumb as a teen and didn't recognize peak!   I became a fan during the Acceptance Speech era, so I was always a big fan of Tilian and Jon's dynamic together. Tilian fucked up, and there is no excusing what he did, but I hope he manages to properly seek help and the band can somehow move forward with Tilian.   Jackpot Juicer is a killer album and I can tell everyone worked hard as fuck on this album. It's a nice send off as we're graced with Tim's funky and slapper bass lines one last time. RIP Tim, thanks for the music  💙
I just listened to the whole album. Wow. just... dam wow. Every dam track. There is 18 tracks and nothing disappoints.
My ears just came.
I love this song :)
And this is now my new favorite song off the album
I love it. That's it. That's the comment.
Jon is killin it. He rocks.
I'm a mailman, I can listen to them for 10 hrs a day, the whole discography
My favorite of the new singles! But I love all of them soooo
Heck yeah jon got the moves 🕺🕺🕺
How is every song better
New dgd = week is made
Killer lineup since acceptance speech and it got even better with the addition of Andrew! So glad we got to see them together one more time for one more album.
I need to buy this album right now … I hope tilian can get a second chance. This is so good
*pepe the frog intensifies*
Is anyone else weirded out that this is the last album DGD’s going to be appearing on as it has been for the past near decade?  I mean no matter the changes in members that have been made throughout the years before that they still always slay, it’s just been so long since such a big change that it... well I guess it Feels Bad Man
Rest in peace Tim thanks for giving us another sexy bass line
Definitely not my taste with this single. Hoping the rest of the album is more like the first 4 singles released
a summer classic from DGD, love it. more please
Bruh... Jon Mess slaps every song
When this banger drops as you’re sitting on the beach. 😎   Nice.
Bass lines are so radical on this!
Got my like and vote for dance Gavin dance national holiday
WIll Swan rocking the Fantano flannel
Jon is on another LEVEL this album!
LOVE U TIM ❤️
I wonder how the community and band will react to the whole Tillian controversy going on rn 👀
I love all of the singles that have been released from JJ so far, but this is one of the VERY few DGD songs that has absolutely grabbed me from the first listen. Holy fuck am I excited
Feels And I cannot stress this enough Bad Man
RIP Tim💚❤️💜🧡💙🦢🕊
Tilian might be better when it comes to dancing but Jon dancing awkwardly was the best thing I saw 😄
One the best song where Tim sounds on point .
This is my fav song off the album. Calling it
The best band in the world returns with yet another banger
Definitely not ready for tilian to be no longer with this band.
Absolutely incredible.
my man jamming out on the bbq at 1:31 absolutely cracks me up 😂
Jon's part's giving off a Good Charlotte vibe
um excuse me?!?! 😳 I fucking love you guys what the fuck?!!!
How is every song coming out of this album a banger. How.
Dance Jon Dance 🦄
Tim :(
They just don’t miss…
I quit my job just to listen to this song. Now I’m bout to get high. 🫡
This really reminds me of some of there mothership album
EWW sick
Not quite the same old dgd song but enjoying it so far. Tim will be missed.
DGD lo tiene todo! 🤘🏼  Siempre disfruto muchísimo cantar las partes donde lo hace Jon ❤️ jaja
This song is one of the last times we'll see the band together. And with the song name, "Feels Bad Man" just almost seems like it's a farewell in a way maybe a change of the tide of sorts. Idk how to put it, but it kills me honestly. I love Tillians vocals, love his solos stuff too. Sad to see him go in such a way and same with Tim. I just feel it'll never be the same without them both. Been listening since Acceptance Speech
Johns vocals have leveled up on this album
I've been the top 1% listener on Spotify for I don't even know how many years in a row... and this album so far is literally all the vibes. Absolutely love you guys man. Absolutely kills me that I've been deployed every single fuckin time you guys go anywhere near "home" Wish I could've seen the band all together. Thank you for filling my day with such amazing music!
I can't stop listening to this groove. I think this is one of my favorite DGD songs hands down
Oooooofff ya that "No" at the end. Sheeeesh.
jon mess is so attractive i cannot
oof the bass line my god
Thought Jon was saying we don't care about ass ass no. Like, ass x 18, but ass x 2. 🤣🤣
Banger
This record has everything to be the best work of Dance Gavin Dance!
Oh man it's godamn a master piece, I guess if its the last album with Tilian (which I really hope not or I am having depression for the rest of my life), it is probably the best album he has made I n DGD T_T
Do you like hot stuff? Do you enjoy hot sauce? Do you like sweet stuff? Do you enjoy sweet hot sauce? Do you like it on your food?
Loving the new stuff! Missing Tim. Anyone notice the Apex Legends Lifeline Hairstyle?
Omfg I'm so hyped for tommorow. Damn this album hits so hard, Jon really slaying on this. Fricken hit after hit! Keep up the amazing stuff everyone, and hope Tillian is figuring his shit out, I love his sound but I'm not cool with what he did.
They could've unironically made this music video 20 years ago lol
Are you freaking KIDDING me with these guys? Htf do they keep making music that blows my fucking mind!!! I love these guys. I think you guys are in my all time top ten. Maybe even top 5!
Did you realize that all this time your crown was just a hat?
John mess is putting out Reese from Malcolm in the Middle energy in this video
I've been saying feels bad man for so long, and this is just the cherry on top of the Sunday 😵
So happy Jon is taking the lead on this album. My man is spitting BARS every track. HE CAN’T MISS!
Miss u tim n tilian
This video is  🔥 The song is a vibe. I couldn’t love you guys any more 🫶🏻
Jon is just slaying on this album
This is the best song so far
Unpopular opinion alert: So far every song off their new album has been among their best songs ever, except for this one. I didn't like this one at all. It's pretty rare that I don't love a DGD song. Here Comes the Winner is the only other one I can think of actually
Tim ❤️
it just hit me that this is the last footage of them together, i'll treasure it inside my heart. gonna miss tilian
So glad DGD dropped a song on my birthday
Rip Tim <3
Tillian come back please!
DGD making songs out of 2016 twitch emotes here
Never in my life did I ever think I’d say… this, this is the best song in the discography.
I had no idea DGD would be this fucking good almost 20 years later lol. Every single has been absolutely insane so far, I didn’t think anything would top Die Another Day but this might’ve done it. And there’s still so much more coming out later tonight, can’t wait to hear the album.
What a song for Tim to just unleash on, absolute stankfaced at that bassline for three minutes and twenty four seconds
When DGD switches vocalist for the 4th time:
DGD
Whoa, you're alive Do you ever really stop and wonder why? Is your soul fortified By the tiny twinkling light inside your eyes? Whoa, another night Should you live with your regrets or just get high?  Feels bad man The up and down of the emotion broke my loading hands Replaced my legs with sleepy pants They make me smoke 50 grams I don't pander, mandible clamper, setting a standard You can't touch my precious glow I don't care about answers, no  Tell yourself a story, life is pretty boring See you in the morning, let your worries drown Like chlorine, keep the liquor pouring Flap until you're soaring, let your heroes down  Well, I think I've seen enough But I hoped this trip would come and save me My life ain't bad enough, so I scratch this itch Incinerate me Heart pours the core of my flex The lord in my step The organ it plays through Time blows the horn in my chest I'm boarding my jet The plane that I came to Brain brimming through a sea of bats They're nipping chords and spinning webs of rhythm as they flap Are you de-calcified but stupid high? Still sad after sex? Did you realize that all this time, your crown was just a hat?  Whoa, soul divine Is there anything out there to dull your shine? Bump bump bump bump, boom Ten hundred times 'Til one day you wake up and you feel alright Bump bump bump bump, boom Ten thousand times 'Til one day you wake up and you're out of time  Feels bad man The up and down of the emotion broke my loading hands Replaced my legs with sleepy pants They make me smoke 50 grams I don't pander, mandible clamper, setting a standard You can't touch my precious glow I don't care about answers, no  I don’t care about answers I don’t care about answers, no  You can touch my precious glow I don’t care about answers, no Don’t care about answers, no
Alright …. this right here SHREDS !!!
ONE MORE DAYYYYYY
fucking love tilian
This song slaps so hard
every song’s a banger. most unique sound ever 🔥
Tim 💜
rip tim. just lost a close family friend. seeing all the boys together one more time hits home. love yall
jooooon lookin wiiiiiiiild
This is Jon's world and we're all just living in it 😂
God dammit Tim KILLED it on this record. May he rest in peace ❤
Jesus I was not ready for how good that song was going to be it’s like honestly how good can one band be. Ffs 🤦🏾‍♂️
Banger after banger. That's why they've been one of my favorite bands the last couple years
That was a great music video, John mess fucking killed it lol
at 43 This Band is Unlike any other, Funky, Heavy, talented and actually really really good.
What a groovy bop of a song! Tim shredding all over this shit, Jon on another level in these singles. This is a damn 90's video! No shot this isn't their best album, I'm so fucking excited
Banger
Im loving this song’s vibe. And so different from the last single. Looking to be a good album.  Production also sounds really good on this album. All instruments and vocals are right on.
alex bigman is on the cast list twice. or else theres two different people named the same
Can’t wait for Tuesday to see them with royal code.. Kurt Travis is dad. I hope he plays strawberry swisher pt2 :)
Jon at his best, RIP Tim
Tilian with that ReportOfTheWeek sized coat
classic 2010s metalcore pool party music video trope <3
This is so difficult to watch... RIP Tim.. and farewell Tillian...
I’m so glad I got to see them live in may only thing sucks is my gf was being a little bitch and wanted to leave early so I didn’t get to hear man of the year live
wow this song is for dancing 🕺💃
Your music never fails to deliver!
FeelsBadMan
Yesssssssssssssssssssss
Whose the new guitarist??
Do you know I was so stubborn on JC but Tillian is complimenting it more and more this album is almost dbm2
This is such a perfect video as Tim’s last. The 90’s cam corder vibes.. remembering the good times and memories. As you would see in any home movie. Feels bad man.  Straight bop. And yes Jon. I as well smoke 50 grams 💭💭
Jon was brilliant in this haha
Bruh I love dance Gavin dance like bruh they so damn HARD WHO TF PLAYIN
GODDAMNNNNNNN WHAT A FUCKING BANGER. I can’t wait for tmr
They can't keep getting away with making back to back phenomenal songs/albums
Jon is such a damn goofball!
This is gonna be the album of the summer
Banger after banger, you guys can literally do no wrong. Taste is subjective but y'all are objectively my no.1 band.
Best single so far. Can't wait to see what tomorrow holds....Feels GOOD Man!!
Okay, we all know this band is amazing but tbh I was NOT expecting them to pop off this hard with the new songs so far. Especially Jon, like damn he’s owning this new album already.   Also when I saw the promos for this music video I did not realize Tilian was wearing pants at all and I was very confused lol.   Also Rest In Peace to Tim, we will forever miss your funky beats ❤️
Jon's little jigs are sending me ❤
I love Jon doing his little dance 1:40
Fuck a like, where’s the unworthy button at??😂
So summer✨
Something about Jon and Tilian together has just been perfect since Acceptance Speech - probably the best iteration of the band RIP Tim. I've been going through most of the albums lately and Tim just shines through so much more when you actively listen for him. A shame about Tilian, I was so hopeful for the continued success once Andrew officially joined - let's see what the God squad can do without Tim and Tilian. No doubts at all about Jackpot Juicer, but interested to see what's next
this is such a fun song and the perfect video for it. I can't help but smile watching this!
Summer is here 🌞
The only band I know that somehow gets better each album. I never find myself going back to the "old" music because they just keep topping it 😂
How fitting for the day im having, are you watching me?
The music videos, lyrics, the band itself is eccentric in its own way. I can see why they're as popular as they are
👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾 amazing 😊
Yooooooo this album mf slaps so far.
Fuck this was fantastic. Thanks for another banger boys!
Welp going to the good will to find a over sized suit now. Tillian has one and pulls it off nicely. Made me laugh with the dance. Love it.
Bless This Mess.
Omg this song slaps!
jon in jnco jeans, when? camping is a +
Its jons time to shine for sure. Cant wait for tomorrow. 🙌🏽
Freaking banger, just one after the other
DGD incapable of putting a bad song out
another banger. so excited to see them live later today AHHH <33
Big Don Broco vines with this one!! Dig it.
SCREAMING
I gotta deal with pain every fucking moment of my life, but this makes me want to live. goddamn you dgd.
The worst part of this song is my speakers and headphones will never be loud enough!
Tillian’s in this? Way to hold accountability 🤡
And yet another banger to hit our unworthy ears!! Nice job guys!! Great song!
Jon is on a new level this album
Keep watching just to see Jon letting his hair down like that busting moves
Jon is a legend
Why do I feel like they made this song after Tim died? That "wow, you're alive" in the beginning hit hard.
Was just gonna smoke a bowl
Jon mess. Essential party guest , baker , air host, android, pest control .... what can't this guy do
SO GOOOOD
Listen number ..  lost count
Tillian need to get back in the band, the album is insane Andrew is a nice add to the band, and damn he is a unit  Happy to see Tim in the video, he'll be missed.
Omg I just love this band thanks for being creating amazing music throughout the years 🔥💗
I dunno how I feel about Tillian now though :/
RIP Tim. Glad to see him in the video a lot more than he was in Die Another Day
FeelsBadMan
RIP TIM 🤍
It cut me seeing Tim.   Jon Killin it that outfit bro
absolute fire
DGD are like crack, you get a small bump of their music and the next thing you know you've had the same song on repeat 5000 times and half the day has gone...
Jon's energy on this album is immaculate, song's, videos, bts, this man is in his bag.
Jon really put his whole Messussy into this one huh
jon's dancing  thats it thats the comment
its refreshing seeing jon without the rat king makeup
Feelsbadman that this is the last video before everything went to shit
"Let your worries drown, like chlorine, keep the liquor pouring" amazing line
Will Swan looking like he's about to rate Jackpot Juicer a STRONG 10
FeelsBadMan
honestly, im hyped for the album. this song slaps so hard!! thank you guys!!
I really felt this song was about addiction.   it really resonates with me and it's kind of funny that when I first started using opiates, my friends and I would always say "feelsgoodman" so when I saw this title, I was like hold up. then it felt like an addiction song ironically.  this whole album is fire dudes. I'm all about this sound.  thank you for always bringing happiness into my life. 🌻
Increíbles, Tilian no te vayas 🙏
Is 0:48 a reference to a music video? It looks so familiar!
Cant wait for the Andrew era
Tilly and Jon’s vocals are always so satisfying. Can’t wait for my jackpot to arrive tomorrow! 🍓🤖
Crazy how we had five singles and still have 13 tracks left or 12 since untitled isn’t probably a song but I’m SO HYPED
Tim's groove has been great so far on the singles. Finding myself loving it while trying not to dwell on the fact this album is the last time we'll hear it.
Pretty good, Not their best but different and catchy.
Favorite lyric: "Did you realize that all this time your crown was just a hat?"  Killed it!
Dang I love you guys
All your songs rise like an anthem in my heart 💓 thanks for your art, you are a very inspiring band.
My cold little heart is all a flutter. Bittersweet watching this for sure ❤❤
How did Tilian hit an A-flat? I'm just...sheeeeeesh
AHHH! Favorite single yet! Can’t wait for the whole album. This is making me want to score a ticket to the sold out show too: even though I’ve seen y’all twice already lol
This album so far rivals dtbm
For the love of god tilian go ONE SONG without abusing vocal effects jesus
only 7 more hours until the full album is out
Jon with some Reese vibes.
God I miss Tim so much 🥺💜
Tilian looks like a toddler trying out oversized clothes with that fucking jacket. 😭😭😭
AWWWWWWWW DANG
Will Swan sending subliminal messages to anthony fantano that this is gonna be a 10!
Clean vocalist just nails it every time. Love this one
I miss the Rat King already
This is a total bop but I swear to god Tilian only knows how to write like two hooks.
LADIES & GENTLEMAN... THIS IS THE ONE  THE SONG THAT WILL SOUNDTRACK THE REST OF MY SUMMER
Seeing them tonight in Anaheim! Let’s go. DGD!
Jon Mess shined in this one.
Another  amazing song, please Tilian, never go away ❤️
Gonna be the best album since Mothership honestly
This is giving me 2000s video vibes with that filter LOL
Jon!!! God damn he’s such a vibe!!!!
first things first, Jon is fucking H O T with the 90's skater vibes holy shit  second off, tilians lyrics are kinda rubbing me in the wrong way just with everything that happened.   regardless, a solid song and its mixed beautifully.
Jon Mess is the most entertaining person in all of post hardcore
Jon Mess is the star of this video. Made me laugh the whole time. His character is always great in music videos
Just Bring Back Tillian already
DGD never dissapoints! This record will be a masterpiece 💙
Whatta banger
#FreeTillian
Not feeling this at all....
Timmy fucking slaying on this jam!
Okay this one is just all groove and I fk with it! 🔥
:O
Oh fuck they schmoovin
Another banger  Also Jon Mess = current summer vibes 0:54
Jon’s drip is undeniable here
Love it! ♥️🤘🏻 Can’t wait to see them preform this live. I have tried twice to go see them and I got so sick when they came.
This whole album is mint so far.
Love the song but ah......seeing Tim made my cry and seeing Tillian made me feel REAL weird
The only thing mess was missing was the old 90s ball chains that everyone used to wear to complete that outfit. This brought me back lol
GOD dude these singles have been nothing short of greatness
I need tim's bass tabs for this ASAP.
Como sempre, DEMAIS!!!🤩
Probably the grooviest shit I’ve heard outta y’all in a minute my god
OH MY GOD DGD NEVER MISSES 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 the GROOVE this has, the pure awesome vibes!!!!!! bruh i've never been so excited for an album and i've been here for over a decade. this is fantastic 💖💖💖💖💖💖
'Yo, you're alive!'  *feels bad man*  Classic.
what a banger
I love that tilian and dgd can make summer pop songs but then still deliver much heavier post-hardcore type songs on the albums and it all just meshes together so well. They pay attention and make music for the fans that are into different genres and god I love it
This band can't do no wrong!..... musically of course >.>...
Another banger from DGD
Yo that one dead girl looks related to will swan at 2:08
Listening to this on repeat. This may be my favourite song you've ever made, and I thought the same about Synergy and Pop Off! Is damn close as well. This album is going to be your Mona Lisa, I don't have any doubt of that. Let's Go!!!
Jon's outfit tho 😂👌🏻🖤. Great one guys, you've done such an amazing job on this album!!
A new song the day before the album? What a treat!
It’s amazing!! Killer vocals too! 5/5 hits so far 🤩🎰🧃🍓  RIP Tim 🍌
Man that sounds great. Really great. Might have liked Tilian's vocals down about 6db in this specific case, though.
Kirin J Mess
Jon Mess for president.
Love you DGD!!! ✨🌞🙏
CERTIFIED HOOD CLASSIC
Another Banger!
HOLY... Jon is on another level with this album. He full on just leaned into the pitched screams.
The way Jon sings "Feels Bad Man", feels so damn satisfying.
I love this band. All they do is drop hit after hit
Catching this one fresh from the press
That’s it. I’m showing up to the next DGD show in a grossly oversized blazer
FeelsGoodMan  love you guys thanks for all the tunes
There is nothing more better than seeing mess in neon and glasses that fit him well
So much support and love going your way guys! Love and miss you Tim❤️
man so pleasantly surprised to see Tim again, didn't expect that, but got sad afterwards, because all we're left with is his groove and bassline which  is kind of emotional in itself.  other than that, it's weird that they kicked Tillian out. I assume it's because the band's image got tainted, but if that was the case, why do they keep releasing videos with him? Instead they prevented him from working and making a living. It's crazy how you can lose your job because of stuff from your intimate sex life made public.
i think this one’s my fav
Jon Mess is a national treasure
5 singles goddamn
Tim’s baselines will go down in history
kinda hard to truly enjoy this with the allegations and all, oof
YOOOOO
Holy shit, I think this is the first DGD song i hated.  Weird.
Can we all start dressing like Jon again please?
The vocal layering Tillian does in every song makes his voice sound so artificial. He does this effect on nearly every song on JJ. I'm over it man.
FREE TILIAN 🍓🍓💕💕
Whoop Whoop!
Wow 🤩  this is amazing . Best song of the new album ( for now )
"Feels bad man" feels good man lol
Phenomenal
This album is going to be insane
Not gonna forgive myself If I never get to see Tillian and this group live. Please stay together.
Tilian 🙌🙌🙌❤️❤️❤️❤️
The song sounds like 2020 but the vibe is 2004
As a Pool Operator I approve this music video and groovy ass tune “Like chlorine Keep the liquor pouring” lol
JON'S GOT MOOOOVES
This album is actually heavenly so far wtfffff
I like the lyrics as always. Cool music video to go along as well 😎
that bass line is fricking awesome!!! love u Tim 🖤🖤🖤
I love that the video is 4:3 instead of 16:9 to go with the old school vibes. This is a cruising on the highway with the roof down song if I've ever heard one
These guys were so good together and tilian ruined that. How sad man
i loved this video, the song, the album (AOTY for sure) Thanks for all DGD!
Jon's rad dance moves are marvelous to behold
Gracias Por Todo, DANCE GAVIN DANCE, Perdón por tampoco!🎰🧃
* Yo después de ver bailar a Jon  - Hoy fue un gran día :')
Party gavin party
RIP Tim 🫡
Tim is jammin his lil heart out on this one :') I'm cryin in the club
I love Jon in this omg!!!
They never miss. 🔥🍓🎰🧃
Why is it not on spotify?
I've been a dgd fan since I was in high school over 15 year ago. I've seen them countless times and even met Will and Matt who both tried to console me when I admitted I hated my name lol "Hey, you're named after a badass movie though! 'Heathers' is a classic!" I've still got the drumstick Matt gave me 🥰 love you guys and can't wait to see you again next month!
Amazing Tim basslines!
Jesus’s disciples after his resurrection 00:19
Anyone know where the waiting room / intro instrumental music is from? Really hoping it’s part of an actual song we haven’t heard yet from new album.
ok I have a lot of opinions: - the video is pretty clever. I appreciate how both vocalists are wearing weird shit for different reasons - idk about the song itself. while instrumentally great as always, tilian's part just leave a lot to be desired imo. I try not to be biased because of his recent escapades and I hope I'm not. his vocals just feel very "mothership"-y to me, as in overproduced and a a bit too in my face. also the song lacks a climax
NEW ALBUM TOMORROW ‼️‼️
Holy crap I love this band
Fucking GROOVY
Tiktok warned me about the man in the big red coat spittin' at me outside my window
Will this drop on Apple Music before the album release
Love everyone but, damn, if this isn't Jon's album so far. Absolutely killing it in every song.
My favorite so far, hyped to listen to the whole album
This is giving me the same vibe as their Semi Charmed Life cover! I fuckin love it man
Glad Tim got to be in this!!
Pass on this one.  Probably the worst of the singles they released thus far.
Jons style is unmatched
Clicked right away. His voice is amazing seriously.
Tilian over here looking like the live action super mario bros Goomba 🤣
Early 2000s music video vibes
RIP TIM funky AF my man
Is this part of the new album ? It’s not on Spotify and doesn’t fit the other music videos ?
New song FeelsGoodMan
Yaaaaaaaassss
BLESS THIS MESS
Holy shit! I cannot wait for this album. The rest of the day is going to be so slow
FEELSBADMAN! Even tho it feels soooooo good ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Tilian looking very Hugh Hefner
FeelsGoodMan
Go Jon!!!! another killer song 😍
Banger
I expected more
I’m having a really bad day today, and ironically enough, this song is hella cheering me up.
Goddamn man hittin’ us with another BIG BANGER, STRAIGHT BOP!!! 🎰🧃🍓   P.S. Strawberry’s Revenge promo
Why does it sound like he's saying "don't care about incest now"
Leave it to Jon Mess to face plant into the pool….
Jon looking as cute as ever. Love you guys !
goddamn jon. dude keeps getting better and better with his parts. i dont understand how he can scream like that.
Yay....loving these new jams!!!!
I’m so glad Tim is in this music video. ❤️
This is totally what they prolly looked like in the 90's at a pool party
Tbh I was worried when Afterburner came out, but every single for Jackpot Juicer has been a BANGER.
One of the best Tim's groove!
I miss the old DGD
Keep tilian in the band man! Groovy song, have loved everything as always👏🏾 can’t wait for the record to drop tomorrow
Love the funky bass lines. Tim will be missed ❤️
Why does this band fucking THRIVE in tragedy. Fire as always.
How has every song just been totally amazing? Also my three year old is obsessed with Die Another Day. It’s on repeat constantly and he even tries to sing to Jon’s parts 😂
DGD 4 Lyfe 🔥🍓🔥🍓🔥🍓🔥
I love it! Thank you DGD <3
nothing hits like that dgd groove iconic
What time is the album coming out
BANGER
hit it Tim!
👑🐁🥰👑🐁🥰👑🐁🥰
My cat died yesterday. I’m really crying a bunch but I hope this song helps me.
Feels Good Man! Can't wait for the album tomorrow!
Hmmmm
This was special🍓
заебись
A FUCKING JAM
That was magical
IT’S A CERTIFIED GROOVER
I fucking love you guys, all the music you guys make never disappoints ❤️🤘🏼
Man, they have some good dance moves..  especially Jon lol
Tim 😪😪
i love this ♥️
Jon picked up Tilian's swaying I see, careful Messy boii...
Oh so divine🎶 indeed
Tim💖
Ugh sooooo obsessed
Jon is the man!
this is my favorite new song of theirs 😌
Feelsgoodman
Came here for the Rat King. Stayed for the Rat King.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
need
Let’s go
Dance Gavin Dance never fails to amaze me!
we’ll never be the same after this premiere
YAYAYAYAYYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYA
REVERENCE FOR RAT KING FEELS GOOD MAN
Once again, I'm hiding away at work just to listen to this lol
Whoa, you're alive🎰🧃🍓
Just listened to it. Not really feeling this one. Hopefully the auto tune isn’t used that much on this album.  Great instrumentals though
young enough to feel this,  My body ROLLLLLLLLLLLLLS!!
Noice
Is Jon mess related to Andy samberg because when I see strawberry wake video it's all I see lol
Man, the synergy between these dudes is unmatched. It's so hard not to just pop off to everyone who doesn’t love this group. Every new single so far has me like "man, I sure hope to die another day if this is the kind of music coming out". DGD truly is the cream of the crop musicians I need in my life. And how some people just don't see how great they are?? Feels bad man.
Already heard it. It's groovy 😎
All of the songs so far have been bangers. This will be my favorite DGD album yet.
Sin duda sus canciones siempre me sorprenden cada vez más, mí banda favorita sin dudas. ♥️ Cómo desearía que algún día vengan a Argentina 🇦🇷
Feels bad waiting all day for this on the east coast.
It comes out 30 minutes after I get to work lol….Feels Really Bad Man
Hohoheehee
me when i heard the recent dgd news
less go
I think this song is gonna be my favorite the happiest and the sadness one  🍓🎸
>tfw I read the lyrics on Genius already Right in the feels.
Wait for back on deck tho 👀👀👀👀 holy shit
I can't wait. You guys are my favorite. It's always a better day when they drop a song
come to the Philippines😁👌🏿💨
🔥🔥🔥
The font for their name is a little weird. Literally thought it said "Danee Gavin Danee." Lol
Tilian stills on DGD?
Use this comment as the 19 hour HYPE TRAIN 🚅
NO FUCKING WAY!!!!!!!!! So fucking stoked for this
It's the hot sauce promo song
This is gonna be 🪨 SOLID
Get ready to cry... RIP Tim Feerick the Man of the Year!
BRAZIL HERE
Can’t wait I can already tell this is going to be amazing
Midshift coworkers gonna be forced to get down with me on this ❗
🍓
Seriously I am so excited for this! Thanks for always making quality music every time guys!
📸❣🎶
What’s y’all’s favorite song off that new album that you all have heard so far? Mines definitely Synergy
Bump bump bump bump, boom!
Omg!!!! 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🍌🍌
My copy of JJ and my XL hoodie is coming in the mail today. Gonna miss listening to it early though since I'm going to an AEW Dynamite taping. I can still wait assuring all these songs will be bangers.
Feelspagman LFG more DGD for me woo
Things are about to get Messy
TIM FEERICK FOREVER. 💜💜💜
No more Rat King? 😞
Omg fuck yes
PLS MAKE A SOUTH AMERICA TOUR 🇧🇷🥰
Gonna be sick
