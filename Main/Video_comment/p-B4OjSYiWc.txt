I’m with Chris “Did he really just make that “ 😂💀
Abraham Mohammad osama annoying asf with his “all ball” and “I’m like that” buddy you suck
What happened to the rematch with 2hype at 600k? Now it’s Faze at 700k. Stand on your word.   This is from the future… It never happened. Nothing! No 2 hype rematch and no Faze with Bronny James. Dude was lying to get subs.
Gio is ass
Carlos sucking again n nick sorry to n the man beard think he good but never plays
There's something wrong with carlos
Had to turn this off from the second hand embarrassment from the fake blonde dude airballing every second.
Who’s the lil boy that dribbles at half court and only makes one shot lol ur not doing nun by dribbling back and forth 😂😂😂
At 15:40 u missed type score was 11-10 but Crash scored a layup and the scored board stayed 11-8 instead of 11-9 and then Cam hit a 2 and should have turned 11-11 but score board said 11-10
Man said somebody move the basket 😂😂😂
Lopez Lisa Gonzalez Thomas Jones Karen
No disrespect, but Carlos has no right to say, “That’s a terrible ass shot, boy.” LMFAOOOO.
tiktokers are just as bad blonde hair dudes tryintyto shoot halft court barely hast strenghth to reach a freethrw

This must be for the video, I’ve never seen people play like this
16:02 was not a foul 😂
HE GOT ROCKED!
Miss these days fr fr
Ol boy was fucking carlos up wit dem dribble moves
Hate when a mf only has handles but can’t score for sh!tt
gio wise has to be the worst ever
“Go to the remmmmm” 🤣 nick sound like a bitch
bro cam wilder now would cook all u but shante, nick, and chris. carlos is terrible.
Carlos dont even know how to pass the fking ball!
carlos gotta be autistic or sum
16:55 the ball was fully out of his hand when the contact happened. Not a foul
9:55, Cam took a shit & Piss on Nick.........J'd the fuck outta that boy
omg, carlos is a bust
11:40 wat the fk carlos?

ayo carlos might be ass but at 12:48 he sat that nigga down 💀
Carlos = team mascot.   Chauncey should be playing in the gleague.
ya would’ve lost if gio wasn’t on there team
Kid shooting half court selling the team
this was like the all star game of yt lol
Nick, Carlos irish greeeeennn, Chauncey?? Sorry if I messed it up.  CHRIS .Watch all yalls shit.  Much love
Who the fuck is that fake ass steph curry? He's throwing shots away 😂😂
Carlos is so dumb he called mans shoes Kyrie’s
Carlos is TRASH 😂😂😂
Y'all kind of Palm Beach county and play
7:12 how is he louder than the mic😭
It’s funny how ya really that trash smh 😢
Gio Wise - Single handedly losing both games for his squad!! 😂😂😂😂💩💩💩💩💩
Then tiktok boys was shooting they asses off tho 😭😂
And dragon ball z hair is like 2-40 with that deep shot acting like he’s good he was on my team taking those dumb shots and not passing I’d smack the hell out him
Bruh I hate short bearded guy on nick team he does nothing and act’s important 😂
Carlos looks like sloth from the goonies!!
9:58 that was all luck
If these videos are scripted I’m officially done watching these smh
Fouling every time down the court and then complaining abt getting fouled is crazy
I love watching yall punk a bunch of 18 year olds. But yall was real quiet in the D
Sorry Nick but you got no defense and very little offense bro
15:21 that shot was crazy
abe can’t we talking when he averages 0 0 and 2turnovers
Carlos be acting super tough on here but was more quiet than a church mouse in compton 😭
These teams would get flat out humiliated where I play. The worst player on my courts would be the best player in this game. Wtf kinda game is this? Nothing but iso and long threes. Defense just stands around flat footed and not one dude made a cut or pick and roll or anything. No one moves unless they have the ball. Pathetic. That dude in the blue with the headband was the worst of the bunch by far, followed by the blonde hair kid who dribbled 20 times just to move farther from the basket and chuck a 40 foot brick. That dude in the Smith jersey was getting cooked. Either one of these teams could’ve easily dominated with just a little teamwork and ball movement that you learn in 5th grade. The simplest of plays would lead to a bucket every possession.
Never seen someone like Carlos talk so much shit just to play like ass. Carlos = worst on court every video. name one person on nicks squad that didnt get pissed at Carlos for his 0/10 skill.
You guys are jokes
Carlos didn’t score not one time so he can’t talk n he Fuckin ass istg I could score more points than him -boy
Asian dude play like a random in 2k lmao. Never thought I’d see it in real life
Cam wilder did nick dirty
AND ESPECIALLY CHRIS IS THE FREAKING GOAT 🐐 🔥
I FREAKING LOVE YOUR VIDEOS NICK ❤
Both these teams are wack would love to watch our bench tem beat the shot out of these guys for real
My guy I am 11 and I am still better then nick
When that short gold hair dude start shuffling with the ball I feel like all the rubber from the bottom be worn off
ngl carlos would rlly get beat up if he ever jus swang on em
someone mess up the score when chris got scored on u didnt count it
Gio pisses me off sm this guy has seizure handles and a netball shot
G$d D#%n Cam…great shooting
Nick is a clown.
Ever sense niggas said Carlos special Ed I can now see it
Carlos is  like bla bla bla bla bla Mama bichó
someone gotta humble this fucker carlos. "youre ass" but airballs every time 😂😂
I almost forget about Debo 😂 Ngl losing him is definitely an L coz he’s mad funny
E man is so bad at the game
At 14:32 they cheated them they supposed have 9
that Gio dude is horrible, knows NOTHING about basketball. a charlatan
Kid throwing up 85 ft shots lmao

Gio is so dog shit😭😂😂💀
Title says tiktokers wanted to fight, it be the "savage squad " that want to fight🤔
10:31 that boy pulled his shirt, smh😂😂😂😂
Any win against a team with Gio in it...you don´t celebrate. That clown sucks so hard🙂
Let's admit Carlos shouldn't be talking bc gio wise is so much better than he is lol
Why is Gio acting like he him 1-8
Bro really calling 16-17 year olds little 😂
Asian kid needs to calm down and think about why he is doing the moves he is doing... Dude just crossing over frantically to be crossing over... then lobs it from deep because the ball-handling never gets him anywhere...
0:26 that boa Chauncey be on everybody ass😭😭🤣💯
Look at Carlos when he said ima ape nigga
You goto get Carlos off the court.. Faker the jordans at payless
Carlos sux hands down lol he always talk and be main one don't score haha!
MIN 7:28 FARAON LOVE SHADY JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA
Y’all niggas come back to Atlanta and run my squad
Need to get that blonde kid and the guy with the orange stripe on his shorts recruited.
Chris names he gives god victims 🤣
They didn't count one shot tf
Carlos a straight 🤡 he should be the quietest dude on the court
atpistume visus ant kashes. Atvarykit i Skaudvile
That blonde Asian is buns lol
always the worst mfs talkin the most. carlos, abe, chris
Nick when a feather touches him: "FOUL!!!"
anyone who talks about breaking someone's jaw is a straight up, shit talking b(*&^
Gio so trash idc
Between nick yelling for the ball every possession and Carlos randomly screaming for Doing nothing lol this channel is stupid funny
love the content but carlos needa be humbled
6:25 Chris wtf was that bruh??don’t ever do that dance again my guy🤦🏾‍♂️😂💀
Geo need to learn to shot the damn ball and same with Carlos, stop shooting from your fucking hip and chest. Learn and practice shooting the right way.
i hate that the ones getting caried by nick are the ones that keep talking shit
17:30 “fuck yo cage” had me dyin 😭
16:58 carlos cant be saying nothing he haven't made anypoint yet and cam scored on him a bunch of times
this az the scoring was off df
jesus christ between carlos running his mouth and  gio trying to do his tryout for the harlem globetrotters i am not sure who is worse
That boy Cam gave Nick that work 😂😂
Carlos straight trash water I don’t know why they even pick him up
Los running his mouth but still ain't scored one bucket
carlos sucks
iman/abe is a hack 💀
Wanted to see fist fight but at the end only trasktalk.
Carlos didn't even hit a single shot why is he even talking to much crap😂
Blonde hair drilling like curry 😭
i think we can all agree that the commentator carried this whole video 😆
Briz - didn’t seem in it guarded cam good but cam way better in This game Abe Lincoln - says he really like that after hitting 3 non contested 3s 😂 aight you like that  Carlos - talking so much shit to miss wide open shots and let freaking GIO WISE hit contested 3 point shots lmaooo trash can player Chanci - solid player actually did his shit   Chris white - said “watch this pussy” and didn’t do anything the rest of the game lmao, if y’all notice he actually calls fouls every time he doesn’t score cause he thinks no one can guard him 😂 trash player
Bruh I'd literally beat tf outta Carlos. 😩
Carlos be talking all the trash and he just sucks
14:34 why didn’t y’all give dude his point?
Man I love iman.. my boy don’t give a fuck what size they are he calling them.. all out💯
Every video gio is in I always hope he loses most annoying person to watch play. He played like Julian Newman fast dribbling and 60 ft 3pt attempts
Y'all use that bitch word like it's okay.....not in my world
Dude Chauncey basically carries that team tbh, carlos talks shit but always misses a layup or air balls a 3, nick is good but when he getting crossed up and the shooter misses he talks hella shit like bro you over here skating, that big white dude always act hard cuz he’s bigger than everyone there if he did that in the hood hood he’ll get jump for sure
Get rid of Carlos already. Sheesh that dude is trash and starts the most.
Those tik tokers were overkill as duck they pulling up from half court just flinging the ball, no form, no accuracy, just hell merry they don’t know what ball is
basketball level 0
10:33 Ryans clip was so good that they cut the clip straight away 😂
Lmao cam did not wanna pass to Gio 😭
i’ll break your jaw “i know” on yo mama “alright”🤣🤣
Too bad cam was really cooking tho…
as soon as I see Carlos I stop watching
Lmao nick tries to take on the team after getting fade away and still loses the ball. 🤡🤡🤡
Gio is painful to watch
I can’t believe y’all let Carlos walk around with that mouth on him.
I can’t figure out whose worse, Gio or Carlos
Hand is not on ball dude what type of defense you playing holding him y’all soft
I’m Srry big fella got one more time to bring a man to his piece bigg dude too soft
Broooooooo nick why you holding him tho your defense is trash against him bro I’m sorry y’all not serious
And chris dont give a fuck he sat some wild shit but will back it up

Carlos is trash at basketball like me lol
If carlos guarding gio you know gio ASS
I miss the Savage Squad man
Carlos is white as hell why is he acting black

Why does Carlos think he so tough????? He probably can’t fight for shit 😂
Why is the little one on their team always so angry
so nobody gonna notice how jdub makes a layup and no count it
Whoever the guy in the blue was. He ass
Dude in the blue with the red head band.... total ass clown
Man Carlos has 0 speed and 0 acceleration 😂

Gio is so bad they put Carlos on em😭
9:55

Is Nick the white guy? He can jump but not good at basketball.  And the guy called Carlos is the worst player I have ever seen. Just a fucking clown.

Carlos the type of dude to miss a wide open shot and blame it on the wind
17:40 bro Carlos said you ain’t even scoring like he is
Fuck did Carlos even do

Bro Carlos talk mad shit but I didn’t even see him score ones

Ion know dude name but the Asian dude wit the blonde hair be doin a whole lotta sum for nun dude jus be movin in one spot real fast to miss a step back 3 🤷🏽‍♂️😂
Why he saying all lock when he hugged him 🤡😂
Everytime Cam scores in Nick’s mouth, Nick always has to try to get his get back lmfaooo Run straight to the rim and throw up some BS and complain or call foul when he misses 🤣🤣🤣
Carlos talks a lot and doesn't play anything, it's bad !!!!!
bro carlos talks so big just to go 1/10 everygame
the cutscene of carlos terrible outfit then calling him a god damn goldfish wasn’t supposed to be as funny as it was
Why he saying nigga?
10:34 was tough
Gio fucking goes 1-9 and the one he hits he thinks he’s god
Bro Carlos couldn’t guard a brick wall.. that man so slow on his feet it’s sad…

Please drop Carlos and put some actual talent on the team. He's doodoo
cam easily the best here
🔥vid 👍
Nick fouls every time he’s guarding and Chris just tries to fight everyone but cries for a foul when he fouls legit every play. Lol these guys have athleticism but are sorry because they argue like women, especially carlos
Every single time the dude w the mix match shoes is on the court, he’s HOOPING.
nick got exposed 😂😂😂
Carlos ain’t even allowed to shoot Imao 😂😂😂😂
Bruh why buddy in the red shoes shooting so damn far he act like he automatic or some….steph hurting the youth Imao

Chauncey literally threatened to knock it out 4:36 over a screen assisted shot. ps THAT BOY CAM BUSTED NICK, nick didn't do anything. 8:56 9:51 15:20

Just so everyone knows, if nick ain’t bout to get cancelled, he should, maybe Chris should change his on court approach a lil tiny, but I hope only more comes out how terrible of a human nick is..... maybe not everyone roast, but him for sure for now get cancelled...... if people were tryna cancel Eminem, for sure for a while nick should be gone from any fame at all.... then come back with a reality check
K-SHOWTIME WILL TAKE U OUT EASY !!!
Can’t wait till K SHOWTIME comes to the US  AND CRUSHES NICK BRIZ WEAK SQUAD !   K showtime whole team is better than any these guys
bruh i cant believe im still getting nick views cause this shit prolly fake too but im bored. not watching any new videos without chris though you fucked up man
Carlos is trash. And that tic rock dude with weird hair just throws the ball up no shot all luck.
This account is gross
Ian know fred vanvleet was hoopin with savage squad, or "that valeeh dude" as flight say
It seem like savage squad is the problem, ill bet nobody in these cities fight about ball that much, they talk so much unnecessary trash and its mad disrespectful
FAKE
Idk who the dude that nick was guarding was. But if he had better teammates they would’ve won. He was scraping nick shit with nick hacking tf out of him 🤣
Fake content
Nick always trying go hard on Carlos
Clickbait as usual
These guys are garbage especially Carlos. Not quite sure how Nick even has a channel to be honest.
Fake paid actors
Nice one nick keep up the good work
Carlos is complete trash and is a hacker he could never play real ball he would foul out in 2 minutes and Nick is quick but that's about it and I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed it but I have watched about 20 vids on this channel and Nick chills in the back court way too much waiting on a long pass that isn't how a real hooper plays actually the only hoopers on this channel is Chris and Chauncey
Chris Nick and Chauncey would be a nasty 3 V 3
You guys won the game but you guys have horrible sportsmanship compared to the tictockers.
Carlos is by far the worst hooper I’ve ever seen.... yes gio wise is better. Scary.
Geo shoots 1 for 70
Nick get rid of Los n Iman they both sell at least 10 times a vid each.
1435 y’all never gave them they points smh
Cam tuff
Respect to Nick for playing good defense on the 2nd game. Tough cover but he couldnt get to the rim
Im late but can u tell carlos stop talkin trash if he ain’t scoring
Carlos scoring no points also Carlos talking the most trash
4:45 on yo momma he is disrespectful 😭😭😭😭😭
0:30 Sounds like Carlos rapping to the beat 😎🎶
carlos hilarious bruh 🤣
Who is the dude in the beast shirt that’s doing commentary?
Bra nick was getting did that mane hit a half court shit on nick
carlos talk hella shit for someone who not only gets carried by his team but averages 2 pts a game 😭
If someone told me Carlos was blind in one eye and half blind in the other I’d believe em
all bro guarding carlos did was do some quick feet bs then shoot from deep praying it goes in. dude shot like 3-60 he’s so bad
Wait Carlos literally had one three-pointer… 1 three pointer? Dog you were like 1 - 28 haha And the type of defense you play is stick your arm in and hold on for dear life. My god you’re bad
All honesty everybody on that court not hanging with jdubs 1 on 1 that’s a fact
Your team is shiit, all fault's not are fault and like this hahaha shiit of youtuber thinking that are god playing and are loser's hahaha Carlos need a crying box for him let know him
Chauncey is a bucket 🪣. He really shows he is the best on savage squad. Absolute Killer.

You’re not even a hooper, nobody on your team can hoop. Whole squad embarrassing
Sir ur going to hell...u have 666k subscribers

Bro Chris white is hilarious 😂 I like your Guys content
Nick stop hand checking😂

We’re waiting for the rematch against 2hype
Nah Cam Wilder is nice
The most sorry 5 out here
That guy with the revers har sucks
Nigga said he got a $5 jersey on 😂😂😂killed him
Carlos getting exposed the whole video and didn’t do shit on the squad he needs to go
The dude with the blonde hair is so annoying if I was his teammate I woulda made sure he didn’t get the ball….
Savage squat are the goat

Oh and I subscribed
I got my first basketball game on Wednesday so I’m trying to get some tips
Carlos sucks he’s trash and Chris rams too much trash for scoring 2 points
Carlos talks a whole lot of shit for being a scrub
Just watched the first 45 seconds of this video and already it looks like complete garbage, as usual. The fake tough guy BS is so silly.
“Nigga got a five dollar jersey on, stfu boy” 😭😭
Them boys didn’t get their 9
Daaaamn lol... Carlitos HAS GOT to work on his layups 💯
My jaw dropped when cam made that shot 15:18
i only know these guys cus of flight

The gaurd against you is 10x better than nick
Ur so bad 🤣

Why tf Carlos talkin that man Carlos should just be the water boy at this point 😂
Where the 2hype rematch
cam lowkey got more talent than the entire savage squad besides chauncey lmao
@16:55 Cam is cold but he was touched after the release, that wasn’t a foul, unless it was an actual game where they’d call it because of the contact, other than that he released the ball before any contact
NICK PLEASE GIVE CARLOS A MIC!!
Cmon Nick Briz why only 1 video every 2 weeks
Lol Carlos wide open on a fast break but to slow so he passes the ball. 🤣🤣🤣
This boy a clout chaser!!!!!!!!!!!!💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Trade beard for Cam fam PLZ
I’m sorry for the hate but please get rid of the beard
Can someone tell Carlos he ain’t dark enough to keep repeating the N word 😂
Savage squad is entertaining af!!!
Carlos the goat
We need that 2hype rematch since you’re at 600k sir.
Drop new vid

guy in the blue and has a read headband in lowkey buns
K showtime would dummy your squad
Nothing like Nick getting shitted on and he has a tantrum 😂😂😂😂 what a dweeb
this man nick had to beg for flight to tag his shit
The blonde asian dude and carlos are just ridiculous. Some people are not embarrassed by anything anymore. People shouldn’t ignore that feeling of shame inside, it’s natural and exists for a reason
Need more videos
He’s beefing with duke fir clout sheesh
Nick Briz is Charlie Zelenoff’s little brother
Mini jacked Abraham Lincoln still talking shit
Gio tries to hit dudes in the head wit the ball but never catches it after😭😭

Abraham on fire
Video quality is bad for me anyone else have problems with low hd quality?
What about the rematch with 2hype
nick bro  why are you scared to play 1vs1 against devinthelab  , you seems to  be pretty confident calling flight for 100k so why  not keep same energy for dev
I don’t understand Gio 💀 why all his shots at half court
I’m just waiting for a video where Carlos gets slapped into his place.
Were the 2hype rematch at???
He scared to play devinthelab ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ If you know you know boy went quite

Chin strap guys should play football LMAOO defense
First vid not to break a mil in a minute...the decline back into obscurity has started
Bro In orange Kobe’s hesi is tuff
How much does Carlos pay you to stay on the team?
1. carlos is ass so he needs stop talking, 2. the title u made u tried to make disrespectful by calling em tiktokers yet nobody knew u until u made a tiktok, 3. big man fouls whole time n swears he good, 4. nobody on your team would actually do nun yet y’all talk abt doing it hella n don’t
Carlos just be acting tuff cus he know his homies gonna back him up he won’t survive alone on the streets
Great game.
Y’all realize all his vids so fight !
Actor of the year award goes to Carlos. He great at pretending he someone😂😂 dude is literally the worse dude at basketball I’ve ever seen. He’s getting fat. He can’t move his feet to save his life…
Crickets since Dev called you out!!
Nick got exposed by cam
Carlos and Gio are both absolute garbage my god.
that guy said "fck your cage" lol
What’s the correlation with dudes dressing like 2k characters and being bad at basketball lmaoooo
Used to not like this channel but can’t lie they entertaining as hell
Hey Nick please go kick Showtime.
u said remacthat 600k subs where is that at
bruh carlos be running slow as f
I wanted them to play k showtime
14:30 y’all not gon give them boys they point????
Gio ass weak af 😂😂😂😂
$YBarkley. Anything helps. God bless you all
How are the names of the rival team?  especially the blonde
When is Abe and cash playing  loser shaves their beard off
Nick hand checked dawg all game.
Flight gave yo ahh clout shut up man you annoying as hell
The dude wit the beard Ain’t hit a shot in the past 7 videos
Nick and his whole squad foul do hard every play
Nick fouls every time on defense 😂
Supposed to be 11-11 they didn’t count the layup He did I guess
Play dev you p***y. It’s all for YouTube you not a real hooper
beggining of nick briz was his prime. respetfully i cant respect him because of his cockiness and not being able to stay in his own lane. bro thinks he run this shit now thats hes a top streetball youtuber, put respect on other names to recieve it
Like 3 dudes can actually hoop a lil bit out of the 10 on the court in these videos
For the longest time, I thought Abe wore a black mask on his chin but it was actually his beard
My only thing is all love for Carlos and all why tf is my nigga saying he play in the jungle in the cage when he had no points in both games..🤣 any ways love the content
Devin the lab 7-0
so when it was 11-8 in the second game did that point not count that he scored on chris ?
Is Travis ever coming back to the savage squad
Chauncey cold asf tho lowkey bro been balling out
The amount of times that kid with the blonde hair chucked up some half court bullshit until he finally hit one hurt my brain🤦‍♂️😴🗑
Wait, did Iman actually touch he ball for a sec before damn near turning it over?
Guy in the blue jersey pisses me off, lil nigga talking all that shit and dropped 1 point talking bout this is his cage but dropped the least amount of points on his team.
Play Dev you little punk
Carlos is so ahh
dude with the goofy hair style just need to stop hooping. God couldn't answer them prayers.
Imagine Carlos trying to tell someone that was a "bad shot" ..... meanwhile this dude literally airballs every other shot 😂😂😂
Dem boys won’t even kome back to Lakeland with alll dat shyt 😂😂💯
Chauncey clutch asf tho
Gio wise is absolute garbage. You shouldn’t  even give that guy the time of day
Play dev one on one
Carlos cringes me out hard dude
22-0???? You got worked but that dude in the headband a while ago, but you deleted the video
Carlos is so ass bro😭 why does he keep doin that shit
Nick is ass, dude really just jumps lol
Carlos is that guy from Zoolander
Carlos be there for participation points
Blondie throwing every ball is priceless
my squad would make yall 22-1 for sure
Big man is the only talented player, don’t let these other guys fool you. Nick is mediocre at best at it really pisses me off seeing this dude have an ego on the court. Screaming like a 5 year old.
Carlos looking like a solder pimp out there!! AHAHAHAHA
Yea you needa chill. You’re weird asl.
Defense sus af 🥴 y’all can’t go a possession without fouling
“You fcking Minnie Mouse “ 🤣
I’d be so embarrassed to be Carlos in this video. I know the video was titled 5v5 but in reality it was 4v5 and SS still won. All the little cam fan boys need to give it up. Your boys team lost twice and his team of 5 was playing a team of 4. So, yeah, Cam and his boys don’t want that smoke. They obviously can’t handle it. Feel free to reply with the excuses and start defending your girlfriend cam 😂
I’ve told you this like 4-6 months probably even before that but I think I needa tell you again. You have such a negative group, aura and all. People don’t watch you cause you’re good and that’s no shade, they watch you because you’re entertaining. Maybe you should drop the ball and pick up some gloves or something, or just drop the ball and find something else to create content from. Tbh I say this for your well being, you really might get shot one day or something man.
9:56 tuff shot
Carlos just trash
Stop acting tough nick.
You need to play K Showtime
TikTokers fanboys crying in the comment section while that blonde dude thinks he is good at dribbling and shooting.
If you want any ounce of respect at all drop yo boy Carlos he need to play soccer or four square
Punks with bad vibes and trash ballers
SAVAGE SQUAD is fun to watch. Imagine if they change carlos and taliban with better players, that's not exciting anymore
U better not duck Dev
Nick man!.. Ur fighting Patrick Beverley now!!!..🤯..we all know Ur a Skywalker with a tough relentless motor Game!..Don't let them get to you. 👍
Hello  YouTube  Follow me and 💪🏻🏀🇦🇷
Damn Carlos love that fit💀
good channel bro.
Nick be real quiet in these games
K showtime> savage squad
Carlos is gonna get smoked with that attitude, one day he'll run up some real dudes. I used to cheer these guys on but they've become disrespectful and bad for the game. Dirty plays, fouling on defense but on offense if anyone coughs it's a foul. Nick played smart and didn't say much but the rest of his squad acting like a bunch of teenagers. They play scrubs and avoid the real competition, this won't end well and a lot of ego's gonna get hurt, just watch.
How the fuck did I miss this until today !?!?
Can someone just knock Carlos out already?
Who tf wanna see Faze play basketball 😂 we wanna see you ole friga's actual squad.
Why did he put the second game first??
My bad nick
Aye nigga bye the way you not entertaining when people react to it is entertaining
What does "no fade jit" mean?
I also like how Carlos was talking so much shit and had like zero points 😂
@Nick Briz Nick nick nick YOULL NEVER BE FRIGA! No matter how mad you get. inside  You know this and it kills you
Came here waiting to hate on the tik tokers. Left hating the YTers. Carlos needs a reality check
yall was hacking as mf second game
This is real basketball players against clout beast curry wannabes 😂
Jus subbed after a month of watching yalls games. They give me a nice lil adrenaline spike, since I cant play anymore. I miss the game bad. Keep up the hard work out there! PS: those were the trick shot pony peeps, that stuff is only good for a few ooohs and aaahs...the rest is brick city and airball port!
Carlos act like he made a basket😂😂😂…SIT Him Down He’s Making Ya Look BAD😂😂😂😂😂
It’s always the ones that talk the most that have no game wack ass jumper wack ass handles this dude reminds me of a chihuahua big bark no bite
Gio is literally the worst s media player in history
Gio is worse than Carlos with those dumbass shots. He needs to STOP
You should replace Carlos booty for Cam wilder all day!
Carlos is just there for content
Bro carlos is so bad but always trash talking
wtf is that shot skill bro damn
"Thats six.. SIX" classic
Nick and Carlos trash.
nicks team are the detroit pistons when rodman was on it….straight menaces to the game😭
Carlos is a fighter without him the game will boring
Ayo nick kinda got fucked up like 4 times😂😂😂😂
that tiktok boy in orange is tuffff
Toxic . 👎
these guys are trash....not just at basketball, but in general.   Why is carlos even playing or talking trash...he doesent even know how to dribble....
I love how Carlos talks the most shit for being the worst player on the court
Carlos is weeeeeak still, and the dribble queen Gino or whatever might be worse, everybody else was doing their thing.
Bro why they beefing ain’t no such thing as a peace basketball game at a park talking choppy for no reason just say nick don’t go to the wrong park.
I know the fat white one from ballislife I have to say he's much more fun in this video
Bro i can pick up a team of ransoms from Robert king and skunk you smh don’t believe the fake hype, these dudes just capitalizing on what we do everyday
15:25 😳
Your team is slop
Nick and Chris suck ass lol. They ain't even hoopers. Look at nicks jump shot lol. Chris to fat lol.   Mediocre park hoopers that's it
Nick ducking Devinthelab
Nick always fouling on Defence lol, cant keep his hands off
Carlos litterly did fuckin nothing not even 1 point and still talkin shit
my man was killing nick bad
Nick would have a way better team if he got rid of Carlos he is 1000% ass like terrible why does he even get on his squad
carlos a weird dude
Bros can’t play defense for nothing. He don’t want people to push off, he pushes off and then hand checks EVERYTHING!!!
YALL TRASH!!!!! DONT KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I GOTTA SAY THAT 😂😂😂 ALWAYS AN EXCUSE I GOT PLASTERED FOH
Abraham probably the biggest waste of space on that team
like 17:16 how tf are you gonna act like that ain’t a damn foul bro

👏🏽✊🏾😅
Nick can’t shoot 😂😂
Carlos is a walking meme
Nick is sooo asss🤣😊😊
Carlos literally looks like a Pond fish
Carlos stinkssssssssssssss
Go at it with dev you won’t
Ayo Chris jumper smooth af tho
TikTokers wanted to fight...THAT HAS TO BE THE GAYEST TITLE OF A VIDEO. Sound like some little boy shit...come on Nick, you too old for that clickbait 😂🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Carlos be wearing the same outfit everywhere he go 😭 ion know what’s more broke his shot or him lol
Gio pulling up from half court and off balanced for no apparent reason🤦🏾‍♂️
chris talk his shit but cant throw hands
All ball ??? Lmao what?
Playing extra aggressive towards young as dudes when you grown men is lame.
Y’all gotta play K showtime squad
Is Carlos mental 🤣🤣?
10:30 THEY ATE THEY FOOODDDDDD
Why chauncy look like he wear the same thing every game
Abraham Lincoln need to shave that beard lmao
Y’all ever notice how nick too scared to go to random parks at night?
Yall going to get caught up or get smoked one day talking crazy for clout.
“Fuck yo cage”😭😭😭😭
Carlos say the N word way to much.
No fade Jit , No Fade Jit, that was cool !
Hello

Ay nick one day yall should go against k showtime menace vs menace
Nick is just post moves
Spoiler Alert: Both squads are clowns 🤡
If I were gio wise teammate I'd be tryna steal the ball from him he literally plays for the other team
When are you planning to play 2hype you said rematch when you hit 600k
Didnt they just smoke you?????
i used to like watching nick but bruh y’all foul the entire time now
Where’s the context ? … we @ over 800 k bro god
Briz soooo whack yo lol he struggling playing against scrubs smh yall be doing wayy too much trash talking
Carlos dresses like a park player
I guess you can get tiktok famous if you launch half court shots in an actual game and make like 15% of them
Carlos didn't even score wht a bum
Come to Portland Oregon
This is 🗑 everyone but green shorts can’t hoop.
Where’s the 2hype rematch????????
Play @Tjass
Man i was enjoying this channel but i noticed you started doing dumb shit pce
☑️🔥
Did he just say "imma ape Nigga" or im trippin'?
Cam gave Nick the work
Replace Carlos for cam forsure
Nick really wasn’t feeling it this day lol
My favourite player Carlos is back
Nah if jdub was actually playing they would of got shit on idk why j dub wasn’t trying 🤦🏾‍♂️
Let Carlos go …… like far too Lmaoo
Carlos talking the most and didn’t score at all😭😭
Wtf gio wise doing bruh. Literally shooting like he steph curry and missing like he’s shaq at a free throw line lol. Why he gtta waste so much points.
Gio is trash. Hahaha. He though he is a baller
Gio legit sols tho..
love how yt's were the only ones calling fouls while hugging ppl and holding their arm... like just because u have one hand on the ball doesn't mean u can hold him down with the other? somebody tell fake beard to learn ball
Gio wise is garbage fr he just movin in place fast and throwin bs
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZt9WT19zSCj7OicZslB5A
This nigha briz always hoping when he dribble 😭😭
Blonde hair kid just blew it at the end lmao. Trash af
Savage squad looking more like chumps every vid i watch
nick just be flopping now he honestly got annoying to watch
I want nick vs cam wilder plus carlos was talking so much trash at the end and he didn't even score
Carlos play no defense
get cam on the squad nick
This was my first nick briz video, probably the last one I’ll watch
Nick got serious emotional problems less it’s all an act
Nick please get rid of those bums.
I sure do love watching grown men yell at high schoolers
Like if Carlos should be booted from the team.
Before Mfs say they smoking on opp pack go catch a body fr😂
its annoying watching how disrespectful these fellas are
Lübnan James nickname suits a white-skinned man with a braided hair.
Carlos has to be special ed
A game where Carlos does not score is not a match nick
Nick briz I get where your competitiveness comes from brother but don’t let this internet stuff get to you remember why you started g ‼️
16:13 that was 🧊
9:57  Great shot now play defense
7:49 Traveling
Yoooo IT was 11-9 in second game fuck you
Chris is the corniest dude on the squad and he’s pretty good but I feel like they could’ve exposed him more on the perimeter because he’s not that fast. Carlos is terrible he’s the second corniest dude on the squad and he doesn’t do anything
y’all all ass besides Chauncey and Chris.
At 14:31  of the video y’all was supposed to give the guy in the white tank top his point
Bro Abraham Lincoln dude is the most useless one in the team😂
I swear I only here nick complain or yell hey when he misses a layup😂😂
Carlos be sweating so much because he won’t shut his mouth and actually score the ball... dude straining himself yelling but can’t make a shot....... all for the clout
Bet y’all won’t come to jersey & hoop 🤔🤔
We play at a hype court in St Augustine fl if they come out here I promise I’m slapping the shit out of Carlos and nick
is that gio wise? on cam wilders team???
I’m sorry but nick got absolutely demolished on the court against bro wit the mismatch shoes, he hit 3 DEEP 3s on him WHILE nick was contesting the FUCK out of him each time. Sorry ma boy but ya took an L this time 😂😂😂
cam air balls then calls foul... mans was an island...
You guys suck, Carlos talking like he actually did anything relevant on the court, big fat boy playing physical but crying for fouls anytime someone do the same thing on him, black guy threatening his opponent... Trash
Your kinda turning cringy bro
Carlos🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
friga talkin crap about you on his fight broke out at the park in san diego vid.
Bro that one dude talking bout some cages is so assssss
Lmaooo yo Nick I’m weak. You really ducking that real wreck with DevInTheLab on and off the court talking bout you’ll smack someone🤣🤣
Nik briz can’t guard cam wilder no kap😂
Carlos can’t talk he didn’t do shit all game
Gio sold
14:28 How Come They Didn't Count FolkNems Point? Or Did Yawl Missed It?
Gio takes 10 shots from the half court misses and air balls them and makes one and goes crazy 🤦🏻‍♂️
Nick you cool but you gotta check Carlos kid about to get smash and get you into trouble disrespectful
Abraham Lincoln talm bout "I'm like that" no you're not, they were open shots Lmaoo
There's Chauncey!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Look at 17:17 that’s all foul
Why is gio even famous he’s terrible not even dribbling fast lmao
Chris is legit soft lmao calls foul on everything he misses lmao
Love the videos man but you have to drop ab and Carlos they are so ass and they talk way to much shit.
plz play frigas 5
i hate gio but somehow like him more than carlos
Bro Chris called that man minnie mouse im weakkkk
can we all agree that the only reason carlos was playing over there is for the views and to talk shit
Why Nick jumper so fucking broke??? Like it’s easy to practice a jumper that doesn’t look like a 8th grade girl push shot from 3. Too cocky to put in work on a pretty jumper
No one on this team are hoopers 😂😂😂
This camera work is awful dawg wtf
How tf is carlos in that team, he's not even taken rebounds or assist, he's shit and what he says, it wants to be like the boss and he never made a basket wtf
Chauncey low key carries these guys
Who’s beard did red headband steal
Nick got cooked 💀😂💀 This man gio shouldn’t play basketball Man cost them a game doing those BS dribbles he shoulda learn by now when he faced Jlaw 💀 Shiit sad af
15:21 was disgusting
Once Chauncey began talking in these videos, they’ve just become extra, and try to start fights with everyone else. Literally every video is them instigating it, and then acting shocked that someone wants to fight
Carlos didn't do shit the whole game
Slide to reading PA !!!!!
Could swear that dude that was guarding Chris in the wife beater makes basketball skits😂
gio selling
Chris, Nick, Chauncey, and Cam would be unstoppable
I like watching nick because he isn’t one of those hoopers that only post the good stuff for them he post everyone’s highlights
When you playin Dev ? You hella duckin 😂
Wilder shifted on nick nasty
Nick bro you could pick up someone better than Carlos. smh🤦‍♂️
Yo why does nick briz got all type of menace to society badges… lol.
Bro I love u man but stop picking fights with ppl online
HOLY SHIT DOES GIO SUCK!!!
chauncey so weak on his momma😂
Bro Carlos is fcking terrible at basketball and talks so much if I was on the court and he got in my ear he would get punched in his sh!t😂
Carlos: I'm an ape  *Proceeds to run away after slapping somebody*   Lmao Carlos a little punk who would get chewed up by some real dogs
My God that was some fuckin horrible basketball wtf did I just watch
The only people who have any right to talk shit on Nicks team is Chauncey, everyone else is straight dog shit
Another day, another video where nic is gonna get someone shot.
CArlos really trash I  Just sayin
Abraham actually did something today good for him man he put some points in
8:34
Not the fucking Minnie Mouse 🤣🤣😂😂
Oh look another video by Nick Briz & a fight is about to break out. Love the new content
Imma need Cam to know if he’s hand checking you, you’re allowed to push off to back him off.
Chris “thats frigas move., cookies!”
nick cannot lie, you got the best content out for basketball atm keep it up, this is SHOW BIZ
Carlos’s mom did a great job picking out his outfit.
So that layup didn’t count going up on Chris it was 11-9  not 11-8
lmaooo funny how they skipped the parts where they got scored on
cam is your father now
Igh no hate to you guys but Carlos pissed me off bro he is talking shit and he did not score once he fucking needs to shut up
Come to Kansas city and play us you go everywhere else come to Kansas city
Gio sold
It’s a sniper outside 🥸🤣🤧 dude too nice
this whold team are loser lmao trying so hard to act toug h
I love how people are spreading hate in his videos now lmao he didn’t like Friga spreading positivity? He better enjoy absolute hate then 🤣
Abe and karlos are so trash ... idk why nick hasn’t found other people to play and kick them off the team , I think he’s just being nice at this point kause they are fr garbage
Gio and Carlos are both trash
Y couldn’t gio do that against Carlos
Buddy was dropping Nick off all day!
Literally every game the nick crew behaves like shit. Tiresome tbh
Funny Carlos sucks so bad that when he actually scores dudes be like oh n also y he talk so much shit homie barely touch the ball
That Gio kid is the worst player I ever seen
Who tf is the guy with the blonde hair lol he aint doin shit but launcher  prayers
This was very entertaining!
Bronny would send nick back to the suburbs and tell his daddy he met a baaaad man
Brick Briz
Chauncey used to be quiet what happened lol
Gio is so terrible
I would’ve never imagined cam and gio playing on the same team
Chauncey is the ONLY one playing ball...everyone else's stuff is a disgraceful display of whatever this is.
Abraham wasnt fowing he had his arms out but they werent making contact
YAWA MURAG MGA MONGGOLOID
8:25 carry 🤦🏾‍♂️
Nick is traveling every time he's dribbles
Aye nigga 😂😂😂
Nah bro at this point I can’t even get behind what nick briz tryna do. No body tryna fight while playin ball why y’all bringing that energy? Lol it’s corny bro
Can is so good
Carlos kryptonite is Gio Wise LMAO
Yall need to play k showtime
Used this button as a cancel these guys
Geo and cam on the same team?!???!
Lincoln yells out,I'm fucken  like that!! fuck outta here.that boy 3-300.
Nick’s team is just a bunch of scared bullies except for Chauncey
Arab Abe Lincoln went off
Next Time it was 9 not 8
didn't j dub score
Bro I swear geio doing to much man 😐
bro headband turtle man so funny
17:06 idk why carlos is tryna talk 😭, he’s horrible 💀
That MC needa go home 🤦‍♂️🤣
It’s basically a 3 on 5 chauncy Chris and nik the other 2 are fucking trash
The dude Nick Briz hand checks like crazy…..DAMN!!!!
as soon as i saw that dude dribble i knew it was gio😐
carlos and beard dude suck😭
That's a good match up. 2 trash ass dudes Carlos and Gio. They both act like their like that but are trash cans
Lol you most awkward ball player I seen come down to RI
Then called his typical weak ass foul when he missed the layup on the other end
Damn nick is actually trash he really went and inbounded the ball fast af right after he got that fadeaway dropped on his head. Everybody was about to get lit but he ruined it and had to be his normal cheap ass self
I wish there was a mute nicks voice option for these videos I hate hearing him scream at Carlos the whole game acting like he’s any better
CARLOS CONTRACT UP DAWG💀💀
They didn’t count the basket at 14:32 they cheating like a mf!
This squad hella annoying
Nick only has his hood down in videos 😂 Y'all scared of Texas 🔫
Cam is better than nick
White dude, purple jersey. Mouth faster than his moves. Talks trash and can’t back it up lol
BRICK BRIZ
its that garbage blonde dribble kid again LMAAAOO
They didn't count the 11-9 on Chris' head. Why?
Thus isn't even basketball. Or street basketball. Just fouling after fouling
Savage squad need a better teammate iman is trash asf
Where’s the 2 hype rematch
Where’s the 2 hype rematch
Yo. Chris' foot work has gotten so much better. From when he started to now. You can see the results of his hard work and effort he's put into his game. Solid big man for sure. Carlos needs to take a page out of his book though. Carlos talks more and more but never actually gets better. Has zero handle's, broken jumper, and no control of the ball outside of wide up threes.
Asian kid has a lil handle.... Can't get to the rim and a twenty percent shooter
That boi nick grabbin cam whole time
Nicks squad knows not to go to a hood park and talk crazy like that🤣he would get beat up so bad
Replace Carlos ….
Nick briz does meth
Carlos just be annoying asf lol
That Gio kid is awful man 😂
Cam is really dangerous from deep... but he got locked up driving to the bucket.. good defense by nick nothing you can do about that
cant stand when someone gets locked up then when they finally do something wanna talk shit, sit down and shut up you been quiet all this time dont speak up now mouse
I like Carlos but he was getting cooked the whole time. I didn't see one bucket from him. But his trash talking on the other hand....
You guys be hostile as fuck lol
Lübanan james 🤪
Carlo so slow 😩
Carlos is trash. Dude feet move like bricks are tied on them when he trying guard guys don't even get me started on his streaking shooting
Carlos look like a hybrid carrot 🥕
Dude in the last game with the Julian Newman highlights 😂
Nicks whole team is ass except Chauncey 😂🤦🏾‍♀️ y’all just talk mad shit. Especially Chris. Humble y’all selves wanna talk big but get guarded quick to call foul.
Trash basketball, fouls non stop
First time I ever seen Abe score twice he let alone rarely scores one
JFC Nick, you can't just grab dudes with 2 hands on defense then bitch when dudes play D on you. And didn't hear Chauncey talking shit when dude picked him and finished on him on the other end. Bunch of weird mf's
y’all whole team need to start seeing a therapist
didnt they say 2nd game is to 16
Ayo, nick, play Dev, this bitch trynna play flight for money, like please, I thought you wanted real competition. P.S That's weak.
Gio is actually so bad at basketball 😂 he does like handle warm ups in the middle of games and then jacked up 36 foot shots like he’s Lillard😂😂
Dawg Chris Post Hook is God Tier‼️😭 can’t stop it
Bro Carlos talkin but had 0 points both games
It never fails this dude Chris talks his shit and will walk it all over ANY court💀
Why was mr.beast there?
I would love to play yall, cux the bullshut they be doing is hilarious
8:12 I think this means you should work on becoming a more consistent 3 point shooter.
Bro dude said that was all ball 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 bro was literally hugging him
I use to like nick squad fr but they all talk shit and none of them can fight that’s already been proving specially Chris big for nothing and Carlos talking all that shit I didn’t even see him score
At 12-10 can someone tell me what kinda pick that is by Chris ? Illegal af!
And the there’s Chris’s the best post on YouTube and has a nice 3 👌🏿
Why does noone talk about all them dam stupid ugly lay ups nick does lol
Best left handed shooter on YouTube!!! Hands down nick, that’s all you
lil dude on nick team I think I’ve seen him a total of 5 Baskets in 20 games and he talks the most shit 😂😂😂
😭they be going off on Carlos
There’s no one I dislike more on this earth than fake fake beard
Hands down BEST STREET BALL GAME IN MY LIFE 😂😂😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽‼️‼️‼️🤞🏽🔥💯💯💯💯
Carlos has the weakest game in America.
7:50 traveled to a different state
When someone calls an "and one" , that is him saying that is a foul. Every baller in the street knows this. Nick's team does this all the time. When an opposing team does the same, Nick's team are asking them to shout out "foul"... disgrace. SMH       Also, "That's a terrible ass shot boy" -Carlos... BRO... have you seen yours?? @carlosthesavagegod   XD
carlos is suck HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Cam t jass friga LSK and duke
And I'll tell them where I'm at. I'll play them I'll get my own team
Them punk ass squad boys sure like to talk shit I would lay one of they're ass out I hope someone tell em I said it
Anyone hear how dev coming at nick? Shit pissed me off sounding like sour grapes. I don’t necessarily like how the savage squad acts sometime but I respect them and they’re game. I’m not a trash talker is why but I know it’s part of ball culture. People gonna hate no matter what.
Cam too tough
Cam is a different breed
Yo got one point on Chris and acted all big like Chris wouldn’t slap tf outta him and make him cry to his mom
Yo is acting so good but been throwing prayers all game and is so bad he doesn’t even press Carlos like wtf 😭
Why they screaming at 5:40 he did nothing to him
better not talk that fake anger shit to the faze boys you gunna go missing.. damn tik toker shit on nicks head too
I watch nick’s vids cause their entertaining, but at this point it’s not basketball. I don’t wanna watch a team that should win get cheated out of win everytime. The tik tokers who are the better hoopers have to make a insane shot because everyone on nicks team either hacks or holds the player. Cam can’t even do a push cause nicks hands on him whenever he does anything Iike a jab. Or when they hold people going to the rim. There’s no point to play if the team could play to the best of their Ability and still lose because they don’t wanna play real ball. Yeah it’s street ball with trash talk  and it’s physical, but the real rules don’t get thrown out the window. If there was a ref or someone to call fouls decently they would get blown out by this team
Gio is terrible they have to keep him for the comments
chauncey don't attack as much anymore
carlos really finna get knocked out one of these days😂 i love him but he’s gotta chill😂
Parese que buscan la muerte!! Jejeje
Why they take these park games like it’s a championship on the line 💀
Nick defence with hands..1min 6fouls in normal game..so bad bro..
Im juss waitin for duke to knock Nick ass out
Yo Nick Briz, the dude dvonte friga was talking shit about your videos just now on his latest video.just cause a fight broke out. Lol
hate nick or love nick, you gotta admit his videos are entertaining
Ball is life will kill ya
That Boi Cam COOKED you...
How does Carlos forget he's in the middle of basketball? He's one of the few kids that really did need Ritalin.
Nick n his crew corny af
Where the fight? Can someone time stamp it lol
All they do is hack hahaha. You need good health insurance to play them
I'm not even gonna cap , Gio wise is a disgrace to the game of basketball.
CANT wait til y’all tuff ass come to Stlouis get y’all beat both ways
Carlos is so trash man 🤣
ide kms if gio was on my team
I’m convinced they put acts on for the videos
Big dude tiktok danced on him
5:19 🥶🍪🔥
First half of the vid I forgot Carlos was even there. ChrisBriz and them be instigating everything
Nick briz really out here telling flight to stop reacting his vids cuz he don’t tag most of ur views come from reaction channels 😂😂
It’s sad how much better cam is then nick
at 800k yall should play Bronny and mikey and have them bring a 5
These guys titles are click bait. Wanted to fight 😂
Fooking lemon
hahahahah that blondie can drible in the place and jack 50footers and  then he makes one cuz God is good and then he celebrates?TF?
Nick and them trash so they choose violence every time 😷
Oh shit I forgot nick was in the game till the end
Chauncey the only real hooper
carlos out here looking like a rabbids
Since when playing ball became acting black ? Or gangster???? Knock it off with this shit.
Bro if ur on my team and take a 40ft 3 , you not touching the ball again periotttt
Nick will take someone's head off and be mad as fuck when they call foul , but if he misses a dunk or layup and barley gets touched he will cry foul EVERYTIME!  Still my favorite YouTube hooper tho
Abraham fouls every play and says all ball😂
Carlos suck af and talk the most shit bro I been watching y’all so long and he still Anit improving on shit. Find another Carlos or add me to the roster cause he gon end up getting y’all shot 😂😂
I lose brain cells listening to nick briz talking trash homie is just cringe af
nick come to Lawrence Massachusetts either north commons or south commons park real ballers there.
How much to play you?
@nick briz Y’all should vs the cool kicks squad in LA. They said any team that beats them all get a free shoe !
GIO Wise reallly needs to stop playing these guys
3 for 4 for lincoln ok
Nick is more annoying than Gio Wise
That's all you do is test people's gangsta yall gonna get the real one day
And Compton 🤔
Nick why you 🦆'n  @devininthelab 🤷🏾‍♂️
You lot are sad, grown men and your bullying kids
This nigga Carlos gets NOoooo ball time 😂😂😂😂  Trash asf but tlk so much sht
JUEGAN de la vrg mil faltas 👌
That carlos…..  man he is traaaaash
whoever that blonde kid is, ive seen 13 year olds that play better ball than him…
You really calling out flight for not crediting your video 😂 you a straight clown can’t wait for you to finally get humbled
Carlos talk a lot for a man that ain’t score😐
Blonde haired kid is the guy that nobody wants on their team. The other team would have been better off playing 4 on 5 rather than having that dude trying to be the professor out there, but launching scuds. LOL
Carlos needa get his ass beat smh
Ain’t no way bro literally Hugging Ryan mud air and proceeds to say “That’s Lock”
Gio Wise must think you get extra points if you make it from half court.
Entertained by these videos...With that said I could pick 5 randos at my gym and sweep these guys. None of these guys are actual hoopers. Come to Allen, TX. Lifetime fitness. Anytime. Any amount.
Nice cross Chauncey
Carlos talks the most and is by far the worst on the court
Second game Abraham was hittin
Its suppose to be 11-11 in game 2 when the skinny guy score on chris
This gotta be the auditions for ol boy Lincoln's replacement 😭😭
Bro blonde dude is CHEEEKS. Waste of a player smh
I got $500 to 1v1 Carlos
I lost all respect for youtubers some fat lame dudes
Nick such a bad influence on kids watching this smfh man needa grow tf up
Man look at nick briz man so inspirational literally
abe acts like he puts the team on his back every game
Nick be pissing me off with his hand checking
17:03 homie saying his arm was hot and it was a foul. Homie let the ball go before he was even touched STOP THE CAPPPP
where’s the 2Hype rematch
How tf is Carlos getting worse, don’t even make sense 🤣
Nick you need a new squad you criss and shots are the only three that carries your team
Every player on that court is terrible except for cam this shits so cringe to watch now
I like tht abt savage squad😂they get in yo head.
flamingo parkk man
waiting for the day someone drops Carlos lol... dude talk all that shit and is always the sorriest dude on the court.
You guys really are trash man lol you come to jersey and try that bullshit and all them fouls ya swear ya play defense you guys foul 80% of the time and think your playing “lock up defense” and Carlos will get dropped talking like that
Let 2hype n the tikokers play together I get they gone win

Who that afro man hitting deep threes on nick??? He a baller!! Getting hyped all the way here in MANILA.🙏🙏
I hate to be on geo team if he going to shoot like that,
Nick's team is trash they suck and talk a lot they don't be playing any comp at all they just wanna be excepted soooo bad 😂
when nick briz vs eastcoast ball is life team
This is what I'm talking about.  Like battle rap basketball
"On yo momma"
Carlos looking like a burnt fish finger ong😂
Nick u got a strange jump shot
I need to see some real comp. Anyways, Cam is good and all, but he can only go right. Nick appeared to figure that out because last matchup, Cam blew by him at will. But Cam can shoot for real. That one dude on Cam's team with the black shirt has some game. (FYI, I am not referring to Gio)
Gio wise lookin like a donald trump fan with that wack ass hair cut and awful form
gio wise shoots like every kid trying to make half court shots during recess, shoot and pray
9:30 Chauncey playing the game now huh? Did that to the right dude lol
7:50 dude just traveled lol
Mans traveled @7:50
I hate gio whatever tf. He’s popular for sucking. The things that can get you paid in today’s world 😂😂😂
These videos are greaatt🔝🔝🔝
Nick bros got fed the whole time bruh 😭😭😭
The big/tall dude on Nick's team reminds me of the Fonz.
6:31 Drill Sgt Carlos for real for real 😂💀🦈
Nick acting like a bad dog in remission after his team scores. 😂 Don't DONE yourself now
cam violated u three times
3:08 wtf kind of shooting form is that!

Beard MN and Carlos were trash
If you got gio on your team you automatically taken an L. When he shoots it’s a prayer every time.
wtf that beard arabian guy talking about? all ball?but hugging his opponent?check the rules again little baby
15:23 and 9:51 is must watch! see thats why i only like wilder in this video
that blonde boy really ruined his team
9:51
the only person i like in this video is wilder
Bro that squad is so trash
I swear if Carlos did that to me he would be sleep!!!!
Y’all scared to play 2hype
Someone tell Carlos to stfu and make a shot
lmao dude said get it now no screens completely just giving up the game to nick so funny
This the first game Abe Lincoln did something 🤣🤣💀
Carlos dirt dirt dirt dirt dirty and some more dirt
Having gio and carlos in this is like being forced by your parents to let the little kids play
The one w the afro was destroying Nick on god 😭
Nick your defense is terrible!!! Your hands are all over them every time. Judas
Best 5’s so far
Everytime gio touched the ball it was a turnover
I don’t usually do this but I wish the worst on Carlos dude is a straight lemon 😂.
what’s the dude with the dreads who was slashing over abe name?
Nick acting like has got skills friga is pure talent!
Nick need a whole napkin bro 😭😭😭
Bruh this Abe Lincoln guy holds you and say all ball
cam a bucket fr fr hes a fucking bucket
How bad must the shit you're talking be for Chauncey to get that worked up?
This man Gio Wise legit just tap dances for 24 seconds straight and throws hail marys
bump
Where's the 2 hype vid
Omg Cam wth this man was getting buckets 😂😂
Who brought this extra weight I mean gio wise??
If tekashi had a basketball team they would be the starting roster haha
bruhh can we just talk about nicks defense tho...the man grabbing waist left n rightt..hes actually ass lmaoo
This team is toxic af
Carlos didn’t score once 😭😭
I love how the other team is mainly all taller but they don’t know how to get in the paint
Nah bro nick team full of cheaters wit black air forces
I didn’t see any real team play, no picks back door screens no ball movement one pass shoot y’all good but doesn’t feel like a team watching
Such a shit team
can Carlos say the n word?
just watching gio play makes me mad. I would hate to be on his team.
Ocky did phenomenal may I say.
Nick and can needa run the ones RN
Chauncey talk shit, but if you talk back he get mad, Nick is Cam's son, Abe scored more then Cash's last 3 games.  Friga is also Nick's dad. besides that. good vid. IGN 9/10
Nick briz’s channel is a whole L
Nick is cams kid
Cam owns nick
Nick Briz a L always with negativity just shut up n play ball
PG: Nick, SG: Cam, SF Friga,  PF: Chauncey C: Chris. Ultimate Starting 5.
i swear i thought for a second that the blonde guy had tourette
Please drop Carlos he doesn’t do shit at all he talks shit like he scores at all gets hyped when he scores 1 shot the whole game but cam is too hard real deal hooper
Good guys win that game if Geo sits on the bench. 2-170 from 45 feet out
Big travel 10:19
Abraham Lincoln finally scores in a game and thinks he’s hard
Love hearing stupid ass catch phrases like "hes a baby" and "fuck is you talkin bout" 3 times a minute for 20 minutes. Really adds to the video quality.
That’s the first time I’ve ever seen Abraham Lincoln score
Carlos didn’t score once both games and proceeded to talk trash to CAM 💀💀
Why gio of all people
Carlos Is so ass 😭😭
Why is Carlos so bad
Carlos is so garbage it’s annoying 😭
14:27 that didn't count?
Can is nasty!
13:47 even big guy knows that that was smoove
bru gio fuckin sucks,, that man just launches from half everytime he get it
Nick is a legit certified bum. Soft af but wanna act hard. 8:14 dude clearly taps ball away, ( video cuts for a sec) and nick has the ball back. Sorry ass called foul..
where is..... MAN CHILD...... MAN CHILD......
why yall bringin carlos around 😂😂
Bitch boy gio made 1 for 17 in the second game and celebrated. I hate that kid. It’s gotta hurt to have him on your team.
After seeing Chauncey fight he ain knockin nobody his size out 😂
Gio wasted hella possessions both games 💀

"i was out getting pLasTereDDDDDD the night before"
Omg Carlos always be doing the most for someone who’s below average absolute dog water bro god dammm
Man gio be fucking selling
Carlos ain’t even scoring tf bum ass
Dude with the dreads in the green shorts, and light skin dude with his hair pulled back are the only real ballers out there
I'm an ape - Carlos
Carlos didnt do shit the whole game and hes talking the most 😂😂😂😂
They squad real life trash only got Chauncey

Little guy in red head band is now like, 2 for 80...and acts like he special! 🤣
Chauncey is the only real talent on the team
Beard finally hit a shot bro is all talk how you let carlos out preform you each game😭😭
CAM WILDER NEEDS TO LEAVE THAT GROUP HE WITH AND ANNIHILATE WITH NICK
Friga ending that win streak
Sadly Carlos is a dead weight again as usual where is his coffin at
them boys stay fouling😭
3:42 mindofrez is that you
Nick can you please give me a reason why carlos thinks he’s good he did nothing same with abraham
Carlos and Chris is trash hahaha
Carlos is so slow and unathletic. If he could not hit a three here and there he would be useless. He hits deep threes cause he cant get seperation.
They stole a point lol 🤣
Man I like the content but you guys are getting boring and lame… your boyz being toxic every single time it’s getting old kinda like MW…it’s just like ehhhh Carlos think he good cuz he talk better shit then he plays???
Gio singlehandedly lost that game for everyone
GIO PASS THE FUCKING BALL. YOU ARE NOT THAT GUY, PAL, TRUST ME.
Nick this was not your game 😭
nick fouls so much on defense
14:30 dude scored it should have been 11-9 u guys still might’ve won I just wanted to point it out
L video
I’ll buy you a camera bro
Come to Philly
carlos so ass 😹😹
Bull with the Afro was working you Nick
Carlos really trash
Anyone notice how Abraham swears he's "like that" but makes anywhere from 1 to 3 shots a game? The saddest part is, Carlos is reaching his level.
They cheated 14:27 it was supposed to be 11 -9
there was like 4 real hoopers on the court.
Carlos did all talking but no work on the court how is he on that team still it’s sad to watch
White tank top needs to go practice more got all he heigh and can’t do shit
Mfs playing volleyball the whole game 😂
Score change?
Cam fucked y’all up and he wasn’t even taking you serious nick on offense
Carlos talking the most shit but didn’t score 🤣
Yo Nick if you see this, it would be 🔥 if you got savage squad plus Cam vs one of the ball is life teams 👀
Carlos is not ab nun lmfaooo always acting so toughhh 😂😂😂😂😂🤦🤦
Chauncey is the best player in this squad
One of these days Carlos gonna get lit up!
I know it’s street ball but nick was holding/grabbing cam hella
Abraham make 3 shots n say “I’m like that” bro like 4/30 😂
Nick: “Cam if you see this bro, come team up with us anytime”  What Nick really wanted to say was:   “Carlos……..when the time comes for us to play Faze…… you on the bench brotha” Lol
If one of y’all hurt bronny😭😭😭 lebron will kill u guys😭😭
Beard man went off in the 2nd game.
cam is different man
bro where that 2hype rematch at
Nick all you doing is hand checking the whole game that shit is in 4K
Did they say and1 is not a call???
Bro get rid of Carlos smh
Man, they all suck, there's open passes and layups everywhere. All they want to do is iso. Dribble dribble, brick. It's not good basketball.
Carlos looks like a minion and talks like one to….
Get rid of that 🤡 Carlos fr...
Y’all nigga swear y’all hard while fouling whole game then call lil tic tak fouls shit weird asl
Y’all goons🤣 wanna b hoopers
2hype rematch?
Cam too good onm
Savage squad play prison ball not basketball
Why Carlos dress like he from rivet city
Abe is a menace to society
Come to Chicago and try that shit 😂👀
No!!!!!! lol
if you don’t like nick briz team congrats you grown up
Please hit 757 pretty please
Honestly thought the dude in the white tank top was gonna be better or more involved
Yall don't have a team at all... None of yall can play
Check ball isn't a call either big sucka
Carlos so ass and cringey lmao and this team and not winning all these games with out the Chauncey dude. Mans don’t miss, I suck at basketball but I’m confident I’m better than Carlos sorry ass🤣
Lmfao look at titles of last 4 vids lmfao
nicks team is just so ass, all of them, and they complain about everything and talk shit and they’re actually horrible
13:07 as if it didnt take him 20 tries to make that
Carlos is definitely a menace on the court bro, hall of fame😂
11:55 im dead lmao
Yo why does Carlos look like a 2k my player lmao ?
Ngl did anyone else see that nick kinda went MIA in this video and I’m here like wait this his vid, but nah nick was getting shit on cam was on his bullshit from deep👌🏽
Allat talking Carlos being doing instead of scoring I kno his breathe be HOT 🤣
Gio definitely top 10 shittiest players ever
Y’all turnin into a bunch of bullies, I hate it and love it at the same time lmao
If Ur getting trash talked Nick U got them where U want them! I wouldn't say anything just concentrate even harder on making the correct play's n watch them crumble!...I have been a successful paid basketball coach. I don't want to see any of you guys get hurt fighting so this is the main reason I message this.
Big baby
Why he cut that part out
That fucking blonde shuffles his feet more than he makes shots
“They wanted to fight” actually y’all wanted to fight 😂 y’all dumb or sum
Carlos told gio WHAT TF YOU DOINGGGGGGG🤣🤣🤣bro
Carlos is buns..replace him 😂
Nick you a bum 😭 who bets $100,00 on flight who’s trash at ball go face a real hooper like devinthelab
these are some of the most toxic humans lol
Chris complaining about a stiff arm and his best move is a forearm push off???!! Minnie Mouse
Lmao if I got paid to play like Carlos or the guy with beard then sign me haha
Y’all turned way to toxic let a couple weak ass fights turn y’all up
That terrible ass attempt of a pass by carlos......get him the fuck outta there
I watch these videos hoping someone swings on Carlos.....in due time
We really need that flight and carlos 1v1
Its wild how bad they are at ball. fouling the whole game and then claiming the other team foul when it's good defense  savage squad should be ashamed😂😂 oh and Chris whine about everytime someone does sumn to him that he does to ppl all the time🤡 large ass man but can't take someone bullying him😂😂😂  nick fr the only one wit real skill in ball in all savage squad💯👌... but ayee Nick u better give credit where credits due fr. That mans was getting buckets on ya team he had more then u and Chris combined in that last game big facts💯💯💯
Before it’s all about basketball, now it’s all about fights and confrontation
Islam Makhachev played great today ❗️
This was amazing Nick and Cam would be a elite Duo Imagine him and Cam go against Cash and whoever Cash picks
Blonde hair dude is Julian Newman v2
Dude in the black shirt and cam was the only ones putting in work
Irish spring dude: FG: 5/17 DRIBBLING: 75 points STUTTER STEPS: 47points
when basketball becomes a drama show
What happened to this dude’s channel ? Toxic and trying to bait people into fighting. Bad look.
Cam wilder and Chauncey are some ballers🔥
i could of swore right before gio shot there he said its gio time 13:05
I hate that Chauncey is giving into the bullshit the others do. Humble Chauncey was way better.
I've never seen someone hug another man while tryna drive, then his whole team press him lol. Ain't no shame in having them take the foul, but deliberately getting mad at someone cause of your own mistake, then having yo boys defend the bullshit, makes you a trash ass hooper
this episode was ass
Hahaha, every video gets more ridiculous. Now, what is the topic of your videos? Scream like bit....es?
Fights are the only reason people watch your channel soon it’s gonna get old
This shit is Sad. The Video is coming where either you, your so called Big Man or, your Comic Relief Carlos gets Knocked the Fuck out. That is if you're lucky that that's all that happens.
Nick fouls so much hand checks every time and pushes their hip every time he gets burnt
16:12 the biggest toughest guy calls that bull shit we down the other end with a call that soft
Briz sounds like a little girl
mans called foul after he airballed and he hit him after the ball was out
Please come to PA anywhere Philly please just let me know asap
Nick you damn sure grabbing his shirt holding he not crying but you call foul every play
that tall kod that was shooting deep was just shooting he aint even good
wtf is happening here
Calls foul every play this is street ball makes you better tougher right you and the other two clowns think they can rumble 😂😂
Only 1 that can hoop is Chauncey the rest is trash,ass, 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅 etc all the above 😂😂😂
God I hate short guy with the beard on Nick's team..... lol dude talks all crazy but does nothing at all. Swear Nick could insert anyone there and they help the team more than he does lmao
nick...my boy... you gotta talk to carlos. he out here tryna start fights talking shit and he got a goose egg lol yapping like he kobe haha
“All ball” bro was givin him a whole ass hug then you got Carlos cringe ass “this a jungle” like stfu bro you are useless 😭
Shitting on nic
carlos change that outfit bro its clearly bad luck lol
Tell your boy Carlos stop saying nigga 4 I pop out 💯want all the smoke
CARLOS THE PHYSICAL FORM OF STUPIDITY AND ARROGANCE
Cam was on nicks head the whole game
cut carlos please
Blonde dude quite literally is the worst player ive seen Nick play against
it dont matter carlos took gio ankels with him 2 times
Slim is best
If you think Lebron gone let his son risk his nba future to play a streetball game against clowns that don’t even play the game the right way your just as goofy as we all thought
So their defense  is to hug people when they blow past them and not give them fouls the push someone  then went for a fast break what kind of circus we have here
All dat beef cam n gio had bs they playin on the same team 🤣🤣 goofys
All THESE DUDES 🤡 S TO BE HONEST
Why Carlos talking so much if he ain’t hit shit
Bro I watch this channel all the time but fr nicks team look annoying as hell to play against sometimes man 😂  Call everything on their end and then bitch about every single obvious af foul on the other 😭😭😭  Mfer that foul at 17:16 lmaoooooo like have these dudes ever played in just a single league EVER lol man's would be fouled out in the first quarter ctfu
Carlos and Gio just take up space on the court there horrible lmfao
Gio Sucks Chris talks shit ALL THE TIME but is soft Carlos is trash AF Headband sucks and his defense is non existent Nick and dreads are the only two who play hard both ways consistently
Chauncey is a savage
whole gameplan:pass it to Chauncey or Chris
If bronny James play y’all better relax don’t try to ruin the brand of a kid who actually has promise with y’all ghetto antics deadass
Bro did Carlos make a single shot?
Like I get this is streetball but literally all of them except Chauncey are fouling every possession. They’d lose to 2HYPE if it was a legit 5v5 with refs
Man Carlos is so ass. He doesn’t rebound, he can’t dribble with his head up, he smokes layups, and he doesn’t pass the ball right away. Even y’all get frustrated 😂
I get it that this is for entertainment value but thinking they can ball... well that's another story. Love all these guys as ppl... even ali aukbar hit a shot and carlos omg dude is nuts... but that's why i watch... for the entertainment
Iman has only made one shot since 1863 bruh. On top of that the dude in the red shorts, and the dude in the orange shoes was cooking him in both games.
Man most of these fouls from cam's team is bull shit
These fools are going to hack and possibly hurt bronny 😂
That lil Asian kid is why ya lost
What happened to the 2hype rematch
Some more of the clown squad
Nick be keeping his hands on you while defending
Blonde dude needs to change his name to "Riley Freeman" get the moves but can't shoot for shit
my favorite thing about your vids is how mean yall are lmao the disrespect keep it up
Does Carlos own another outfit???
Abe Lincoln and Carlos talk the most for people that do the absolute least😂
Play devin for the 100k dont duck
When Chauncey talks shit people keep their mouths shut “On yo momma” 😂
Carlos had 0 and talks shit to a 16 year old that had 10 points on him foul squad
How the “we don’t even care bout basketball” dude hosting y’all event now 😂 what’s going on here
Should change your name to foul squad always hacking and pushing and shit
Tik tokers ??? ☺☺☺ damn how gay
Bruh nick stay crying bout fouls but fouls mfs every time they drive 😂😂
Carlos 🤣🤣 "AIRRR F*$Xing BALLLL"
Who’s the one shooting deep 3’s with mismatch shoes
Cam wilder is the best player there y’all can’t really win if u don’t foul that kid is far superior than y’all
big boy purple shirt=biggest baby
impossible that niggas aint fight them yet 😂
Chauncey the only baller on that team
17:37 “Broke ass Kyri…. Kobe shoe laces boy”  -Carlos 2021 😂😂 like damn if you’re gonna trash talk at least make sure you can talk 😭🤦🏻‍♂️
Come to North Carolina, bet you won’t
that boy chris be roid raging foreal
I like how “Savage squad” is more like a bunch of little boys who think they got big cahones. Play the game, stop calling shitty fouls and this bully ball where you think you own the court. Especially Chris who is the baby
I got no respect for someone threatening to hit a 17 yr old, when dude is fuckin 26. Idgaf what you say
Chauncey came through and Iman actually showed up 🤙🏽
Carlos funny as fuck
you guys always hackin
They lost 2 games i was there. Post it loser
I used to love the animosity but now it’s too much like nick not even that good , Carlos shouldn’t be taking at all 😂
Legobeard Lincoln was droppin em off game 2 😂😂
13:07 Gio and Carlos two of the worst players to get famous for playing basketball 😂😭
11:50 if Gio actually got to the 3 point line before shooting he might actually make a couple every time you see that man he standing at half court waiting to throw up some dumb ass shot
Chris SUCKS
Pick up cam wilder for the faze match
Kio shoot long distance all the time, makes 1 out of 10..
Dude with beard really gotta stop talking he’s a liability and does absolutely nothing
Chris sucks that what the fuk day talkin bout
I’m only here to say nick Briz is corny for always trying to fight.
what a complete tool Nick Brix is
3:59 ever since Carlos smacked that dude a couple videos ago and they all held the dude back he’s been trying to act mad tough with everyone like why are you getting all crazy at Gio? He didn’t even do anything to you. This is what happens when your friends don’t let you deal with consequences of your actions he slaps someone then runs away while his friends hold him back now he thinks he’s some fucking tough guy 😂😂😂😂 Carlos used to be entertaining but now this whole shit is getting to his head and you can see it in the way he acts
Nick whole team was fouling their asses off in that second game lmao
Y’all tough guy act ain’t gonna last long when y’all have ONE decent hooper on the whole squad … that shit gets old
2:29 it’s bad when nick and Chris both got more consistent 3 point shooting then bearded wonder he hits one like every 2 videos 😂🤦🏻‍♂️.   13:29 holy shit 3 made shots in the same game  😂😭 I picked the wrong video to comment this
Carlos is ass, kick him off the squad please!
Honestly Think If It Wasn't For YouTube Y'all All Be Bitches Lmao
One of these day there going to run into someone who has a pistol & ends up shooting them , there’s no room for anger & wanting to fight someone in sports that’s just bad sportsmanship , I know it’s the street but you ain’t that good , it’s just a hustle that’s all .
Cam really hit that shot in Nicks mouth. That was like some Kobe gamewinner shit
Carlos is so ass lol
Gio is lucky this game he was hitting his shots but cam was having bad luck
i wish i had the ego dude with the blonde hair has
Stop given that nigga gio wise the ball
Damn that gay asian kid is so bad id probably take carlos over him
“ cookies “ = foul
Why Carlos be having that weak ass fit on
damn yall Throwing oops to the ghost inna corner
Can someone explain smthng to me? like I get the whole street ball things, i played street ball all my life, and i get it, i really do. And i love watching these videos they are pure and raw and fierce. But it seems to me this dude carlos is a dick. He flexes his muscles, shouts and curses other players, calls them out for bad shots, and as i can see, he isnt even that good of a player. sometimes he shoots a 3 pt, yeah but in this particular video he doesnt score and still insults other players. I get chris, who is a defensive guy and his ability is to tackle players and stop them from scoring, which he does, and then he shouts at other players because he blocked them and thats cool, but man, am i wrong about carlos? seems like he wants to provoke someone or he is compensating for something. am i wrong?
Abe Lincoln out here hugging people 😭😭😭😭
it felt more like 5v4 carlos is shit
If you’ll look at the shot at 16:56, it does look like Chris clipped his arm. Anybody can see that on replay.
Bruh Carlos talks too much 😂😂😂
Ya fouled every play on defense then threw temper tantrums on offense 😂
Carlos looks like his breathe Stank’s
Devin wants the smoke...stop being a 2
bro really trying to get shot just for playing basketball 💀
Hey Nick we wanting see y’all play against T Jass and his brother at a 5v5
Bring this shit to Trenton, NJ and I promise y’all won’t be this hype
How Carlos say, “You’re ass, you’re not even scoring” and not score at all
I just have to say it, boy Gio ain't so wise. 😂😂🤣
Whoever that little dude with the beard is, he absolutely sucks. I mean straight 🗑🗑🗑
Come out Camden New Jersey
I just can’t stand watchin this gio wise kid play basketball.  It’s cringy AF!!!!    I see what he’s trying to do, (this and1 mixtape type crap). But he honestly has no idea what he’s doin. He doesn’t know how to use his footwork, jab steps, hesi’s, etc.  he just knows how to put the ball thru his legs fast staying in one place, tires himself out while giving his defender a rest and accomplishing nothing.  Each time I see this dude play I get more n more nauseous.  Young kids who don’t know any better may think it looks fancy.  But anyone that knows ball, has to see this is a joke.  You think by now he would be working on these things while he has this exposure n try n make a name for himself instead of bein laughed at….Not even gonna get into the way too deep 3’s and half court shots he chucks up, and attempted step backs that he shoots from his stomach and will just get blocked so easily it’s not even funny.  I hope the kid starts actually wanting to get better and improving on fundamentals instead of just taking whatever views n likes he gets from really young kids.  He will regret that 5 years from now.  Facts.
Carlos had 0 points talking all that shit!!!😭😭😭😭
The bearded cheerleader finally scored, let me take his spot I’ll score more
Where does Carlos get the confidence to talk all this shit, dude is so ass and rarely scores
Carlos vs Gio funniest sh*t ever
Y’all gotta do some best of videos. Love seein big Chris gettin hype
CARLOS IS NOT HARD LIKE THAT 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Carlos on the roids😂
That Gio kid is so bad my god
Carlos 0
Cam really hit that shot in Nicks mouth. That was like some Kobe gamewinner shit
Exactly 14:30 he scored and y’all didn’t move it up 😂 y’all B.S
Y’all boys cheating @ 15:29 y’all were tied 11-11 y’all took the point from when buddy scored on cris
Y’all gone go to the wrong place one day
Give cam a good team and its over💯
13:30 “no fade jit” “imma knock ya out” “alright” 😂😂😂
It’s giving replace Carlos he does way to much talking & way to less scoring glad he barely got the ball this game!
15:26 score supposed to be tied up technical difficulties End score 11-15
Abe lincoln get one bucket and think he tuff lmaooo
Everytime carlos shoots he skips in a circle thinkin he makes it
Holy shit these are getting hard to watch
Son with the 2 toned shoes is really the MVP 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Every fight in Nicks videos lol are scripted it just doesn’t look that way because people are dumb to realize hood people can act too. Wake up why is it that he’s still able to record after these scuffles. We all seen real fights at courts and no one sticks around smiling talking Shit afterwards your supposed to be mad 😡 not calm.
Time for a new cameraman.  This shit was hard to watch it was so unstable and dizzying.  Maybe it was the editor rendering this at some stupidly low framerate.
Abraham made a shot????
Gio is trash and he killed Carlos this video LMAOOO "IRISH SPRING!"
Black ppl
You guys are getting more and more cringe by the day
Nah I closed the video when brodie hit the step back from half court in the intro 😂😭
AINT gon lie no disrespect.. nick he dropped you off.😭😭😭 he mouthed you everytime
Beardboy with the red headband is so fucking bad holy shit. Nobody should be allowed  to act like that with such little talent
that blonde boy just giving nick easy wins, stop passing him the ball he sucks
Nick is always angry cause he has only good at jumping not basketball.
Is that blonde dude Gio or just an impersonator? Lol
Carlos literally the worst on the team, talking crap and not making a single point. Boy shut up
Carlos go crazy when he have the ball. Man don't know what to do.
That blonde "dribbler" just pisses me off with that "sick" handles💀
Carlos 0p 0a 0rb    XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
whole team is so cringey
Carlos is TRAAAAAASH
Get cam a real squad 🤣
They be fouling tf out of cam and he still be fucking them up 😂😂😂
Mouth way to big for such an average players... And Carlos and the other tiny boy suck.. and GIO is a joke, he just play to make one highlight over 20 tries..  This is sucking lately much..
You should change the titles from “they” wanted to fight to “we” wanted to fight 💀
nick and his team are carrying basketball youtube on their back
Gio miss like 3 in a row finally makes 1 “this my s*it” 😂 , all that in place dribbling “so called handles”
Wait so did chris back out of that fight 😂 looks like he was scared
The shut fang astonishingly tug because europe monthly melt times a versed sleep. bewildered, yummy trouble
I don’t believe nick’s team is savage anymore.
Switch Carlos for Cam 😂 Carlos is probably good at 2k but not in real life Ball 🤣🤣😮‍💨
Savage squad a bunch of hacks 😭💀
nicks defense is so trash nigga has his hands on whoever he’s guarding 100% of the time that’s the only way the nigga can stay infront of his man
Carlos is justa clown
Chauncey carries the team get Carlos the fuck off and get literally anyone else
Aberham ur really not like that u made 2 buckets in the past year
Yall notice how he stop saying we're out here spreading positivity bc he knows he's full of shit
wait a minute is nick doing a basketball with gio wise?
On 14:38 why didn’t that point count?
Both the dwarves (carlos & beardman) play hella ass and talk the most smh
please for the love of everything let Carlos go
Brawadis and ali vs chris and nick
That guy who has blonde hair and red shoes is bad all he does is move his feet fast n shoot bricks, and the people in the crowd hella cringe
Y’all ain’t gonna play against faze😭
Get rid of Carlos pls😘😘
All luck from everybody lol 😂
Carlos the best 5th nick can get?
14:31 how come they didn’t get the point?
At this points it’s obvious that y’all are looking for fights
Goku lookin really is doing too much
They should put me on the roster and remove that nigga carlos at this point
Come to NYC if you really like that
Drop Carlos pick up cam… there I said it🤷🏾‍♂️
The savage squad play good but they talk way much more than they can do
title should be Carlos should never pick up a basketball again w his sorry ass
carlos some straight ass but somehow find his way to talk trash to the best players lmao
This title should be labeled "Chris trying to fight everyone"
This video shows nick ain’t got no skill. Just athleticism. Can’t even make the dunks in the video we were looking for 🤦🏾‍♂️ TRASH wilder embarrassed him on his own channel
Bro I does Gio start his shot from his waist?
Carlos, you maneuver like a simi truck. Hang it up...
Can people not tell Briz love going left 🤦🏽‍♂️ he can go right dont gimme wrong but he love going left. Let him shoot until he make atleast 2. Then play up and play him straight. Gotta adapt as the game go on and make him uncomfortable instead of letting him do what he wants 💀. He look like he get uncomfortable easy af omm
u suck getting cooked by cam lol
Gio cost his team both games with terrible shot selection and turnovers
I like watching but this team is starting ti be like BULLIES...crying foul when they get out played
That has to be the ugliest shot I’ve ever seen. You are just throwing them up hoping it goes in
Why you dodging Dev tho? 🤡
Boring ass game…. Gio shooting from the other side of 3 point
Says not going to make excuses, but 5 seconds later makes excuses about getting plastered the night before.  Logic everyone lol
nick holding onto the dude w mismatched shoes on defense and then calls every foul on offense 😭😭
Score didn't change after dude gave Chris a bucket game 2 11-8 14:28
Lmao I stopped taking Carlos serious last video, he just acts tough. Why is it always Carlos and Abraham Lincoln dude always talking the most shit. And why are they always trying to start shit, they forcefully make fights, it’s getting old man. Anyone else notice Nick was guarding Cam with his arm and nothing else in almost every game. How tf is Abe Lincoln gonna claim all ball when he’s hugging the dude.
Y’all see Carlos tik tok bro slow asl why he talkin
How you let gio wise drop 9 on you
Wow Abe Lincoln actually made some fucking shots
Replace Abe Lincoln with flight that would be so dope
Bad basketball again 😂😂

you're whole squad is bums. but Carlos on another level of trash
Carlos got no points bruh 😭
The most points ive ever seen abe make 🤣😭
Quit running from "in the lab" play him
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Nick. Here's your Savage Squad- A-Milly, Chauncey, Chris, 1 Arm Dude and You.

The whole squad nice. Dude with the beard is getting better. Respect
Y’all be talking shit for no reason I can’t wait for y’all to get cooked

Chauncey is the #1 option on the team
Bruh he said 600k rematch and that bullshit never happened cmon bro don’t be using big names just to keep getting subs shits corny
Carlos acts like he’s actively involved in these games… lmfao he’s ass
People call nicks defense defense he is handchecking cam the whole time

Camm dude needs a better team he carried both games
The headband guy is a walking force. He gets no bitches I can tell
All jokes aside though why is Carlos talking 😂😂😂😂
Yo briz gang I’ll whip any one of y’all lol and also are you turds going to try and strong arm everybody and bully everybody even when Bronny is on the other team ? I don’t think so .
Knock Carlos off the squad he’s the biggest set back on y’all team #BIGFACTS
Carlos has no function in this game
Carlos didn’t even score
The only one really “like that” is Cam lol. That boy nice
Why tf Gio get so much hype? He’s terrible
Carlos got scored on by Gio bruh. R.I.P. his entire basketball career.
It’s low key scripted bruh they have gio trying to do his thing for content on purpose cause they know he’s going to ruin the other team
they jus pu$$it’s if they played on my court they wouldn’t last they would get the sh!t smacked outta them for talkin crazy like that fosho especially Chris and Carlos
unless I missed it but this might be the 1st gm I saw where Nick didn't dunk & Carlos didn't get his usual lucky shot
Nick a hack
did carlos just say that was a terrible shot to the guy who owned them the whole game? bruh
Would love to see nicks team face any nba 5 would be sick to see how they do
Tell carlos shut his face. Lol he will get knocked out
Carlos is gonna punch if he keep doing that shit😂
Chris gotta be so annoying😂 y’all see the title “TikTokers” I’m guessing it’s for content but y’all needa pipe down fr lmao
cam really is a great player. entertaining game fellas .
Nick Briz is the Jake Paul of the Basketball IRL community.
That lol blonde kid sucks shooting from half court n shit. Dribbling the ball but not going anywhere.
12:30 yo that hip thrust is a little sus nickole
carlos a meme
Got the $5 jersey😭😭
Abraham Lincoln beard over here needs to stfu and try and score just 1 bucket
Abraham went off 😳
Bro gio sold 😭😭😭
Arabian Knight😭😭😭
That lil orange haired kid just wastes energy shuffling his feet and his whole body sneezes when he shoots
Something I thought I’d never see, Cam and Gio on the same team LMFAOOO 😂😂
he really hugging the shit out bruh😂
Lol this shit is so funny nobody even takes them serious
Chris and nick r bitched lmaooo
bro carlos and what ever the other short dudes name is, is cringe asf LMFAO carlos start arguments with everybody for being the second worse on the team besides the other short dude w a beard
Lost all respect for this channel went from good basketball to just shiit talking. Smh
you would've got fucked if gio wise wasn't playing
The amount of times your team got away with fouls and the amount of times you called soft/non-existing fouls....
How is oscar worse then gio
Carlos need help
Someone tell Abraham to stop.. he not like that.. we all know he’s not like that
Y’all an L, if your so good why not go to the NBA nick.. trash fr
Yo when that bearded dude said IM LIKE THAT ik everyone said nah no you not bruh😭😭
The obnoxiousness of these kids u play with on ur team makes me not sub
Nick why don't you tell Carlos to stop with the N word it's getting frigging old.
Cam vs Nick
Chris ain’t no hoe he my favorite outta all em real shit🤣
Came for the "fight" Left disappointed
Carlos shouldn’t even try to guard Gio cuz he keeps shooting half courts smh… the games would have been quicker.
I love how chauncey and ritzyraplh was talking crazy
Who else wants to see cam,ypk,zero bounce,beloti,jikarij
Bro chauncey played good but he needs to chill , he literally looks for fights
Were are 2 hype part to at
I’m ngl this squad is def beatable if someone made a legit team, Carlos and the other dude don’t really do anything so if someone actually got a decent 5 they would win for sure
people don’t even click for the balling it’s the *fight* click bait lol 😂
if you guys played legit ball you wouldn't win. Yall just hack the fuck outta people
The dude on the microphone is so unnecessary, lol.
Getting faker and faker man
No cap Abraham Lincoln was getting buckets!🔥🏀💦
Ibrahim saying “all ball” after clearly obvious fouls. I go back to the video he got smacked by a beer can every time he pisses me off. Lol
ABE GOT 8 POINTS IN 14 VIDEOS
Carlos with a solid 0 point 1 turnover (minimum) performance today, might be more turnovers can’t really be bothered to go and count
******More Funny Videos  **https://youtu.be/xa-C8Y0-uZ0**  More Funny Videos ************
This title should be labeled "Chris trying to fight everyone"
7:00 they back at it again 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
gio wise has more airballs than followers
But I want to say this! I love Nick briz! And that’s why I subscribed I love this guy I love the way he plays! I love the way he talks shit!  And I love the way he’s not afraid of confrontation
I also play at this court it is in South Florida sunrise
abraham dawg shit🤣
Congrats to gio must be hard to have a seizure every time you dribble
If it was you Nick and Shante and Chris against three of theirs I would say you win
Nick was getting cooked and he really thinks he has a chance against friga? Heck no frigas squad in 3 🤷🏿‍♂️
Nothing like watching idiots hate on each other.
Nick was cams bitch the whole game LMFAO
But seriously and I will say it if you have people like Carlos unless he stepped up his game and that other guy with the beard unless he stepped up his game you’re gonna have a problem with K show!  Because these people lying about drama they’re about skill if you don’t have a skill you’re not on this guys team.  I’m not saying Carlos don’t have skill but he does not have it up to these guys level
They cheated them out a point it was 11-8 they scored and it didn’t change then came hit a 2 then it’s 11-10
God I have seen Nick rip people to shreds and this guy k show! He has no idea
But I will say this Canada has no idea but trash talk is really about and they have no idea about what it’s like to play around a crowd of people that are not Canadians
I don't know who any of those players are, but blonde guy is worth at least a 3 point handicap...
Cam  protectin gio
I always thought streetball going to Parks was bullshit because you had a squad and they would play and the other team would continually bring new people in totally fresh that is not fair
Pretty soon it won’t be parks, it will be squads! It’s coming! K showtime is bringing it!
Chris is a 🐈🐈🐈
17:04 Carlos touched his arm after the ball was in the air.. guess you are just gonna air ball like that Ninja!
Play Devin 🧪 , stop ducking him
Carlos is traaaaaaaashhhhh
I'm actually curious if any of you played high level basketball....like even beyond your freshman year of high school?
Why does nick gallop when he run? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
RALPHINA DAHFUQ
One like equals a mute to Chris’s comments for the upcoming videos.
I think we are looking at a new dawn for streetball! Bigger than the NBA.  This is getting huge! And when it gets this huge there is the opportunity for big money to be made.  Someone has to step up invest some money and create something totally brand new the same thing we’re seeing now it will be huge
But truth be told, this k showtime is coming! And you and friga and ballislife have your game on!
Fact is if you could, add someone like Travis, you don’t have to let no one go! But it would up your arsenal!
avisa q é o barba porra
Why do y’all like this guy
How does Cam from straight bricks 1st game to buckets 2nd game lol wtf
The savage squad should be called the Anger Squad
GIO Sold the Game
Travis would be a good replacement for carlos
I love you Nick I love the team you put together but I’ve been watching K Showtime and it tells me you have two weaknesses on your team, one has a beard and the other a headband! I like Carlos, but he is not very consistent in his shooting! He is more about drama, these guys on k shows team, there about skill. Right now I think if you play k show, you will lose, but only because of those two people you have on your team!
Why Carlos talk so much trash when he didn’t do anything.
I swear Gio juss needa give up bruhh nigga is buns😂
When people say it’s not an excuse, guess what  they are making excuses. But Cam he can shoot.
Ab Lincoln at least played decent
Nicks squad ain’t that good they just talk shit and get in peoples heads
Don’t know if I could ever happen they are in Canada and they have strict vaccine laws are both the squads vaccinated?
Lmaooo Abe Lincoln bout that life. He time traveled to hoop on they asses man. He was shooting that shit like he did to them confederate soldiers. That shot don’t lie stop sleeping on the man on ya 5 dollar 💵. I’m telling yall Abe Lincoln bout to shoot lights out the next game just like John Wilkes booth did to him
Y’all toxic y’all worse then adin ross fans
This man Carlos disrespected Kobe
Cam reminds me of jayson Tatum 😂
Ngl faze is good in basketball... Ggs at the end
@nick briz tell carlos to stfu please i love u but carlos is so annoying
USA vs Canada! Lol
You guys goin run into the right people soon... all you guys thinking you fighters but watch out... you guys are foulers and poor sports.👎jus play the game
Yo nick, what about this guy k show? Seems pretty good? Says he wants to colab?
Gio lowkey cost them that second game
why y’all always getting into it with folks y’all some clowns
“All ball” and he’s hugging like he’s his father 😂
Carlos stop saying the n word it’s fucken cringey and listen to your name g
Carlos talk way to much shit I’m surprised nobody smacked the shit outta him yet 💯😂😂
The dude in the beard needs to shut tf up 😂
Stop Ducking DevintheLab
Carlos need to quit it bro 🤣 mans is dookie and talks the most
Not to discredit Nick, but he couldn't guard cam
This shit got mad corny please some knock carlos out cold one time. He literally talks against ppl he knows won't swing just to seem tough
Jesus is your way to heaven, he paid the price for your sins. Once you believe you are sealed and saved forever. Salvation is a free gift.
Jesus is your way to heaven, he paid the price for your sins. Once you believe you are sealed and saved forever. Salvation is a free gift.
Come to Cincinnati I know for fact y’all not talking like that out here
That boy Carlos, talking like hell but doesn't even score once LMAO!!!!!
the guy with the blonde wig dribble like he has an epileptic attack.
Nick quit Makin excuses about "I was out gettin plastered the night before" the dude you matched up against just turned you into baby food plain and simple just like dvontay did. I can't wait to watch his 5 bust Savage squads ass and expose y'all like the weak ass Hooper's y'all really are.
1v1 Devin I’ll bet everything no hate you would get your shit dropped off
Wilder was killin y’all ass no bap
Cam had nick on hush 😭😭 and they think they better than Friga yeah noo
Nick you’re savage squad starting to look like a petty squad, man what’s happening. Not you either Nick you’re still the man.
I really like the game but this team is getting very cocky..they are not humble no more
Red Nina wrap( not Carlos) was straight hugging that guy like he was his dad or something
Bro Carlos talking smack at the end when is the last time he scored in a video
I feel like “Bully squad” would better describe what they doin.
This shit is so insufferable
15:22 OH MY GOD
You guys always fight someone... i'm starting to think that it's got something to do with you and not the rest
Y’all would never bring this weak ass fake gangsta ass tough shit to DC. 😂🤣
Nick just jumps high ah and throws the ball in😂
9:55 😱😱😱😱
Nick Briz fell in love with his caracter and stopped Guarding his opponents, now he is simply holding them in one hand while trying to block with the other.
I like how the blonde kid acts all hard after his first half court after so many bricks. lmao
play dev
hope they all get smoked over basketball
Where do i start smh... "tiktokers wanted to fight" yet the video shows chauncy and chris trying to fight... nick fouled buddy everytime he had the ball (and was still getting cooked) then when he gets the same type of play calls ball smh. The second game should've been tied after dude hit that leaning deep 3 on nick it should've been 11-11 but they never got the point when tall dude took chist to the rack.
Carlos don’t even score Nick weak asl only decent one is Chris but he just big. Chauncey the best that’s why they win
Chauncey said on yo momma 😂😂
Your team trash 😂 and so is the tik Tok squad but no hate to you
8:47 bruh
Steph Curry distance 3s with the accuracy of Shaq from the free throw line.
Chris the voice Chauncey the skill Nik The athleticism Carlos and Abraham Lincoln ... Yeah anywho 🤷🏽‍♂️ Bless y’all come the 25th 😂🤣😂🤣
That boy Cam NASTYYYYY
i would literally smack the shit outta you if you was talking crazy to me on the court😭
Yo Nick u suck especially you're character very cocky & running from Devin the lab u need to play him  so he can humble u!
Y’all could tell Chauncey been behind bars from the way he speaks sounds like 1090 Jake
yall would get shot if yall played in NY with this attitude
Chris the best player on savage squad no competition
Bro You guys need to relax you go to the wrong hood acting like that it's gonna get ugly But Much Respect for putting respect on Cam Name
Cam got hof difficult shot
If bronny plays then faze winning
Faze better win
Play dev Ik you seen what he tagged you in
Came for the basketball, stayed for the MMA.
Yooooooo camera mannnn!!! Slow down 5:14 tho .... just saying
I'm soryy but Nick was real quiet with cam greenin on his ahh from deep bro. geo a sellout cam team coulda won
carlos is absolute shit 😂 then he be talkin all that shit afterwards talkin bout "u cant score" like nigga they dont pass u the ball for a reason 😐
Carlos playing basketball is like when the disabled high school manager gets in the game with 8 seconds left 😂🚮
This title should be labeled "Chris trying to fight everyone"
Cam worked nick all game 🤣 the dude with the mask on his chin acting so hard but when they fought at that last park he ran off 🤣
That boy Carlos talking all that shit with no points
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🎈
Is u going play Dev for that 100k ? He called u out Nick or u going make some excuse up 🤔
Calros built like a 65 overall with a 5k vc fit
Nick y’all gotta play House
Gio wise will always be trash!!!
Play dev for the 100k
cam the definition of a 2k21 next gen build
Abraham Lincoln went crazy this vid
GIO IS SOOOOO TRASH
Chris talking about a Stiff Arm and he literally does the same thing 😂
Bro come to Dallas, Texas
Dude is wearing females shorts wtf it’s says Lady Vols those Tennessee woman’s basketball shorts
1v1 devininthelab
Said he had a 5 doller jersey 🤣🤣🤣
Briz u wack
JAJAJA si Carlos estuviera en México, ya lo hubieran matado por hablador, literal.
Chauncey(guy with beard) did not need to be that disrespectful 😰😂😂
« You f***** minni mouse »😂😂😂😂
abraham be foulin the fk out that dude lol
That gio kid thinks he’s melo bro 🤦🏼‍♂️
what happened to the 2hype rematch at 600k
Gio sold
He said “ that’s lock” AHAHAHAA
Nick, Carlos, and that beard kid need to get knocked tf out. Chris and Chauncey cool af tho
Wait where’s the 2hype rematch at??
Cam wilder was hitting and airballing
That lil dribble shit dude be doing literally never fakes anyone. I mean he doesn’t even move anywhere but the same spot 😂
It’s so funny to me how everyone gets hyped over every shot the tik tokers made. Every one of those dudes shooting 30% in a pick up game vs more guys who ain’t pro ballers. But because every shot those clowns make looks like they hit a half court game winner with 1 second on the clock people think they’re actually good. 😂  Dude Nick was guarding is the best one there but he takes dogshit shots too much.
Hearing “Dunk that” from some fools that can’t “Dunk That” , is real PAIN! 🤔
I would pay a pretty penny to see nick brizz and Chris get Choke-slammed
This man Chris’ fg percentage is like 80%
Dude Carlos is trash on trash 🗑
Stop ducking Dev🤣🤣
I'm generally worried for Carlos how can you score 0 points and talk like you tearing them up some straight clown shit lol
what am i watching, worst basketball ive seen in time
Nah Cam was cookin y’all
Carlos talking and had no points
recruit someone over carlos bro
can somebody tell this gio dude that half court shots isnt his thing please? lol
Oh shit got 3rd place boxing in flamingo park i remember these big kids tied my shoes together and through me on top of the slide crazy times in miami bch

Wilder really the best on the court🗣
600K when we getting that 2hype vid
if nick just LEARNS how to YELL FOUL when he drives they will get the ball every time
Carlos and Abraham Lincoln are trash
This is not basketball. This is a perversion of basketball. This is the wwe of basketball.
That boy pulling up from half court every time with the young LaMelo release 😂
10:40 that was a clean play and they cut the celebration 😂
Carlos you talking all that shit but u ain’t fucking score if I 1v1 u imma win🤣🤣
Nick I’m tryna play y’all team
Let Cam play ya when ya play Faze
Nick hacking the whole time
Why is Carlos on this team still lmao
Abraham got the braids and went off

carlos so annoying
Abraham Lincolns first bucket 😈😈😈
Nah Buh respect to briz n his savage squad being created fr
Carlos and the the other dude with the beard is useless the nigga with with beard this the first game I seen him make more than one shot
Yooo yoooo can’t wait for dev to cook yo ahh👀💯
Come to Greensboro, NC. You would not leave with out losing. Yall dont play against real defenders who gon guard yall for real and drop buckets no fouls, no shit talk, just hoop.
Cal was playing wit his food this video
why carlos talk shit as if he made every shot
Carlos is ass. he talks the most and cant even get the ball. lmao
Why did that bum with a vileda mop on his head keep chucking up the most ridiculous shots? Dude was like 1 for 30.
Carlos goes 0-5 and talks like he just dropped 50 :I
Look, im f*cking sh*t at basketball. Like its embarrassing. How ever, i will say that i would rather watch Nascar then this.
Carlos is buns
Abe Lincoln is horrible
No way these foos did better then 2hype 😹😹😹😹smh
TIK TOK SHOULD BE BANNED, BUIT IT WON'T. IT IS SATANIC, AND  IMMORAL
Chauncey and kam are the only two people on the court who can actually hoop. Everybody else is garbage or ok
All that talk and Nick running from Devin in the lab? Don't be a bitch, if you talk back it up otherwise shut up
Carlos is the worse player and talk like he good
These guys are trash
this team was Cam Wilder and the rest were nobodies.
Go up against white iversons best 5 letsssss seeeeeee it
I died when he Said lace Kobes on 😂😂😂😂
Gio trash but dat lighstkin nigga wit da puff was fuckin Nick up
Chauncey a silent killer. you WILL get checked for saying some goofy shit.
nick can’t guard cam without fouling 💀
Who’s the dumbass trying to start fire with his shoes
Carlos tough because camera around
These aren’t as entertaining as they once was especially when EVERY video is the same thing that play against real hoopers & then want to fight every single video it’s boring to see now the first couple of times was funny now it’s stale
Gio just a dribbler he fuckin sold tf out of them everytime
Nobody wanna say it but cam dropped a shit turd on nicks head
That damn carlos talk the most shit but sorry ash ain’t do shit that game😂
Why do y'all stay double teaming when the other team plays one on one and then y'all want to talk mess
Nick dont want smoke with Dev or K Show
Get this bearded guy out of here last 3 videos he been going 0-15 and made two threes today and thinks he’s good like bruh relax u the worst one on the team ✌🏽
Geo is so terrible it’s cringe. Wtf is he doing when he starts dribbling fast like a maniac and moves his feet like that??? It’s sooo bad dude.
Carlos and the other lil dude gone get y’all beat one day. They talk too much. Y’all can hoop I give y’all credit but y’all ain’t that good to talk the way they do. And y’all take it pass hooping sometimes. Them hecklers do too so I guess I can cal that even
I only watch cause carlos and chris are so cringey lol all love tho
Can’t tell who’s worse Abraham or cash
Gio ass a sellout bro
Chris has made massive improvements in his game. He’s been carrying the team in big moments the last few months!
22 win streak gang wya
can somebody please knock Carlos out yo lmao, he just be yelling and sweating the whole video not contributing a damn thing lmao. and got the nerve to get in people faces
When do y’all play 2hype
Lightskin boul cooked y’all two videos straight now 😂 might as well recruit him
They lied about the Score in the video at 11-8. Guy in the tank top makes a lay. Fat guy nicks team complains about a stiff arm and the score stays the same. After that the light skin guy hit a 3 over nick. Should be 11-11 not 11-10. This is wack
Nick was quiet this video 💯🤫
You guys are soft asf calling foul over everything
Deez boys is trash
Who they dropping for Cam?
tf gio wise doing all that extra shit for dont benefit him in anyway 🤡
10:19 clearly a pushoff and then crys about a foul
They never play real competition lol travel up north so yall can play competition
Dev In The Lab called you out for a $100K, let’s see you challenge a real baller.
That guy Jawing with Chris was the same guy from like a couple of vids ago
CAM 🔥
are you scared of 2hype
"I'm like that." C'mon bruh, we watch the vids. You are not like that.
Why is Carlos on the court
COME TO CHARLOTTE
Y’all corny
Chris don’t want smoke when there’s someone his size 😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡
CAM IS THAT GUY BRO 😤
Chauncy :" tighten up before i break your jaw,on your mama" Other dude:" alright" 😂😂😂😂 wtffff
What happened to 600k ?
all of you are proud to be together😂😂want to watch you lose
that I am watching to see you lose you proud companions
This dude gio is fucking weird pulling up from half court goofy 😑😑😑
Dude cam out here really going dumb
Y’all can’t play without fouling😭💯
Nick you need to get Chauncey on the dunk program
does anyone else not like carlos
Nick what you going do once someone hits you , you going ball your hand up and throw a weak ass punch , bet you won’t show it .
I don’t think I’m all that but I swear on my momma that id expose Carlos
The other little guy turning into Osama bin Carlos
“That’s all ball” guy and Carlos have to go away
Carlos?
Yoooooo if bronny playin sit down Juan Carlos n get Mikey Williams
Gio wise is so ass and savage squad are the biggest hypocrites they hack ALL game and when they get called for foul they get all butt hurt but then they get hacked and they cry about it lol
Gio wise blew that fa dem
Carlos talks more than anybody and dude scored 0 in 2 games lol...
Carlos is the downfall of this team. All he does is talk & his skill isn't there to back it up. 1 on 1 against any player on that team, he'd lose by 5. Chris talks crazy, but at least he can play.
Chauncey retire the 11s
"F... yo cage" 🤣🤣🤣
Why every video is always fighting and not basketball...yall whack af
I see y'all like to pick and choose who y'all get tough with
Blonde hair dude watched steph curry too much
Yo why you have the order of games wrong
Is it me or does Gino Wise or whatever his name is have the most awkward game - dribbles in place and throws up the ugliest shots 😂
Cam would’ve dropped 20 if he had his hair down
Dev say pull up 😂
So can we say gio wise really dribbles for nothing
stop ducking devinthelab smoke and pop out since u think u can ball lmaoo u trash can
Chris said “you know why I’m here” but shoots like a fat girl and is out of breathe one trip up the court, nick even said before u started hooping wit him they you are slow and can’t hoop Fr🤣
Seriously right now!! Please geht that over dribbling bum off the court
Nick, you and your squad are a bunch of hacking pussies. Every time someone drives in one or two of you instantly hack his shit or straight up hug him. And the other way around - if somebody even touches you , you instantly cry for a foul. Yelling too much, being too cocky, if you come to Europe with that energy you're all goners my dude.
When the 2hype rematch at?
BABY FOOD
Carlos gonna get sock one of these days
“ I’m like that “ first 2 3s in pass 2-3 videos boys is trash 😂😂😭😭😭
Y'all would not pull up to North Fort Myers Rec Center with this energy tho 👀
U already know Gio SUCKS
grilled nick suck🤣
Chauncey my fav but Cam is awesome 👏🏾….47k away …let’s GO!!!!!!
Gio wise really 🗑
nick and chris has an offensive foul every play bro.....all I see are they throwing they elbows and shit bro this shit sad
cam wilder is nick briz daddy
That boy Wilder is Smooth
Dang devinthelab just called you out for $100,000. Don’t run from this. You about to get worked by him. 😂😂😂
Gio footwork fr look good🤨
how many times does nick want to travel
Wtf is Irish spring gotta do with basketball
Abe Lincoln scored more in this vid than he ever has in all the other vids 😭
carlos is dooksssss🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bronny James not playing yall his dad not letting that happen
Chauncey is my favorite
Somebody got to get a big man to shut Chris up
Carlos need to lose weight my g, he's bit better out on perimeter defense tho my mans presence of mind just too focus on the Trash Talk but I see y'all keeping the win streak keep grinding 💪🏾
Looks like y’all the ones that want to fight the tiktokers
Lowkey think chris the best player on the squad
Abraham is secretly the most hated player on the court
Fam fk what u do fk ur negative energy fk all that. Just the fact that u don’t have respect for ppl like friga shows how goofy u are n where ur heads at.. cause u not thinking long term that’s fo show. U Finna fall off quick times nobody in the community that is above u fks w u.. u done burnt all ur bridges for potentially amazing content with ppl who are much bigger than u. U jus clownin around frfr
abe earned his spot ngl
why didnt yall get the beloti brothers🤦🏾
I love how this page just randomly showed up on my recommend and I just ended up loving this channel
You cant tell me the guy who was guarding Chris doesnt look like kwebblekop
Lets me honest chris and chauncey the only actually good players on savage squad and carlos is the entertainment 😭😭
I'd have to say Friga is definitely better, but damn do the two short guys on Briz's team have little man syndrome. Those dudes were running around screaming with spit flying out of their mouths and neck veins poppin out like they're giving birth.
respond to DEV IN THE LAB dnt duck the smoke…
Carlos is complete shit talks so damn much
Good shit nick 💪🏾
LOL i love savage squad dude literally hugged him and then said THATS ALL BALL THATS LOCK UP LOL dudee really on that
A nick no lie bro u got cooked by the nigga with different color shoes.lmfao
carlos needs to stfu
Carlos is talking the most stuff didn’t even get a point
Shut nicks left side down
Friga, dawg, Chauncey, cam, Chris. Maybe Cinco instead of Chris. Cinco is a boss. Briz is Aite but still mainly a show hooper with not much versatility or a true J. Friga is a MUCH better hooper, can't believe they lost to the bris squad. Carlos is a literal joke like he's more trash than Mr. Stutter Step and he's trash AF like literally not driving capability. Carlos just can't fucking hoop like at all. Stutter step would be a better team-mate than Carlos if he'd learn to pass the damn ball instead of throwing up prayer 24/7
carlos is funny sometimes but he needs to be humbled
Did with that camouflage on I can’t take him serious at all 😂
Stop picking up Gio dude🤦🏿‍♂️
Nick quitting YouTube at 1 Million subs dang
Iman doing work this game with that lockdown defense and sharp shooting.
Bronny ahahah hes over hyped!!!!
Gio got a good jumper but his dribbling  is questionable at best 😂
When Chauncey's scoring the squad stomps everyone.
Yes if bronny James played I put my life on it you and Chris and Carlos wouldn’t even talk one bit of shit to him his daddy will fuck all of you up
My team would beat both of these teams I’m taking about blow outs
10:30 nice play!
Bro gio wise is fucking trash 😭😭😭
Chauncey is the only one that got game its a shame that he stoops down to the level of his band of misfit teammates.....really a shame.....ijs
Y’all realize how nick voice switches his voice when he’s talking trash compare to his little speeches at the end lol
Devin coming Nick he want all the smoke
Little shirtless dude has a Napoleon complex I’m sure of it lmao
Stop making videos with gio. Hes trash shooting from curry range off 1 foot. Gio is the most over hyped ball player
Play Dev in the lab
yo abraham lincoln halal food truck working ass boy be hugging dudes while they trying to lay it up then be like "thats all ball" bruh shut yo ass up and get me a lamb over rice.
These goof troops forget the game isn't just shooting
Nick Briz is the weakest squad to play against i swear😂😂😂😂
TikTok people gotta better range then y’all
Why you dodging Devin you scared?
This world is crazy . You can’t be going around calling people the B word especially in a street hoop game . Some people don’t take it light .
Cam the missing piece to make savage squad untouchable
That Gio kid is horrible. Wastes so many possessions with awful shots that rarely go in.
Nicks bounce is so unreal crazy how easy he makes it look🔥👏🏼💯
Briz team only plays hella mid competition, they would get smoked by a decent squad.
Do the stokes twins or the dobre brother
The fake super sayian threw the game away for the other team.
Carlos did absolutely nothing to be barking at all that loud.
Thought cam and Gio had beef ? What happened ?
Bro Carlos had 0 and his homies get mad when he touches the ball🤣they know he’s bad
Waiting on nick to respond to devs $100,000 dollar challenge??? Trying to call flight out was a BITCH move... BUT when it comes to dev now it's silence and crickets🤣😂
Lol this big dude is talking to much when he’s doing a little bit of stuff😂😂😂😂😂😂
The savage squad stay holding
“broken ass kyries… kobes shoe lace boy” nice one carlos. you got him
Carlos scored 0 points both games and talking the most shit 😂😂
Dude's saying you gotta dunk that who can't dunk. 😂
Nik didn’t say Nun all game
The savage squad always want to fight like cams team didn’t do nun and y’all just cussin and wanted to fight them y’all are trash
Them boys gave you buckets Nik
15:25 literally made me drop my fritos
Carlos did noting
@carlos… straight garbage
Who picked up blonde he’s dookie 😂
Kid with the blonde hair got hype af after making 1/50 lol
The blonde dude really can’t play.  Does the same crossover move and just launch’s 50 footers and pray that they go in!
Replace carlos with me n we not losin💪🏽💪🏽
Cam busted in Nicks face
Gio wise is just ass
the ball should be in Cam's hands more, not Gio
Y’all come to Texas an let me give y’all some buckets
My dude Abe Lincoln: IM LIKE THAT!!!  He is now 4 for 96 from the 3pt line 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️  How flight reacts has a better shooting percentage than you (Time for @cashnasty to take your spot homie) #YouCheeks
geo is so trash lmao, stomps his feet around and throws up shots praying they go in. mis match shoes looks at the camera every shot he makes (4 for 15) savage squad gang keeep it up
Acting like fools
Watching their old videos compared to now,  Chris has gotten so much more aggressive with the ball that's what i like to see
after they make 1 shot: "I'm like that"
Damn Abraham Lincoln finally making his shot n blonde dude just stay dribbling the ball no skill
Chris be talking all that shit but never keeps that same energy for that dude that was in the red shorts that had the mic.
How is this man not at 1 million yet 🤦🏽‍♂️ YouTube don’t like y’all bruh
fouls says thats lock what clowns
carlos's trash
Man every player in this court sorry
love carlos still thinking he tough after he sucker slapped and ran
NICK need some bass in his voice and how you gonna yell at somebody to play defense when you dont play it as well lmfao!!! get Carlos outta there let me run
Carlos got all this gear on and he ain’t shit
Watching gio wise play makes me cringe
Man Carlos talked so much shit but he did no make 1 point this whole video
They lost all chances of winning with gio giving the ball over all game could have been real close without him on the team throwing half court prayers after a Micheal Jackson moonwalk
I hate when nick screams like a girl
Brooo let that man Carlos call me a bitch 💀🤣
Carlos and iman funny asl and they talk the most shit and the both ass asf😂
Carlos aint scored a bucket one and still talk crazy
How much do you pay Chauncey to be the token black guy on your "Crew" and how much do you feed that big hacking dummy to be the loudmouth??
Damn nick Cam did you in this whole video and u ain’t do shit!!! 😂
Ummm Carlos and nick got embarrassed Carlos didn’t score Lincoln that was luck kris was a beast tho
Bro Faze swag over here needs to pipe down. He's shot 2-80 in the past 15 videos
Ian gone lie Carlos is mad annoying 😭
12:32 AYOOO 😳
Friga shits on you
Dude with blonde hair just needs to change that whole jumper and play style dude throws it any chance he gets
bet yall wont bring tht tough shii to memphis 😂
imma be honest, there’s a reason cam in college and everyone on savage squad is not. they play hand check foulin ass defense, cam play defense wit his feet
nick let me play a game on the savage squad i’ll drop more points that carlos!!!
Nick you should kick that horrible player Abraham Lincoln off the savage squad and let cam wilder in. Abraham is useless for o the team. Cam can sink 3s. (Like this up so he can see this)
Gio lost them the game and Nick Can NOT guard cam was hand checking him the whole time. Chris is good but calls some soft ass shit when some one plays good defense on him. Chauncey is A1 thooooo.
Nick went out sad man LMAO  Cam clowned on em all game
WAIIIIIIT TIME TF OUT AINT CAM AND GIO SUPPOSED TO 1v1 ALL THAT TALK THAT GIO WAS DOIN AND THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT THERE
When Chauncey yelled @ Carlos  That shit had me fucking rolling 🤣🤣🤣
How is the blonde dude rich💀
What happened with the 2hype 5v5
Nick and Chris every video same shit. complain about fouls and cry everytime things do go there way.and Chris’s always acting like a though guy 🤣
Not a single possession of good defense lmao savage squad only hacks 😂😂
If Cam joins Savage Squad for the Friga matchup, that would be a legendary 5v5
you will never convince me that chris is not the reason they win games
YO WHERE THE 2HYPE REMATCH YOU PROMISED US AT 600K DAWG
Not gonna lie yall not beating faze no cap  They got bronny  and Ben Simmons and swag can hoop too
Carlos with zero points talking the most shit
*Gio is a bum, dude blew any chance they had at winning either game. Imagine having his low IQ ass as a teammate. I'd be tryna throw hands halfway through the game.*
Gio does all that Dribbling in 1 place just to clank it off the rim from 30 ft? Dude is a goofy.
All honesty Cam fucked nick. Gio should’ve never been there. The most entertaining part was TikTok cause they were trynna catch highlights. Nicks team just wanted to win. They  cherry-picking and doin fastbreaks like it’s 2k
Let me play against Carlos on a 1v1 I beat him I take his spot on your team if I lose you take 1k
Bunch uh niggas who can’t dunk: “dunk that, come on you gotta dunk that”  Shit kills me everytime
Idk who's worse, Gio or Carlos? both these dudes hurt to watch playing basketball!!
that dude folded so hard against chauncey 😭😭
Is it just me...or is carlos movin like an extra clown 🤡 this game....
carlos kills me dude😭😭he’s literally horrible trash talks and doesn’t even know what he’s saying 😂😂
Gio a goofy bro. Legit studders his feet and goes nowhere. That shit ain’t impressive and he launches from half court every shot cus he knows he cants blow by nobody. He trash, maybe try passing the ball too
Savage squad don’t have Chris they get beat by everybody idc
Carlos talk the most stuff and he can't back it up I think my 8 year old brother could beat him
Chris' face at 13:49 lmfao!
Unsubscribed then subscribed again 😂
BEARD
Nick stop bitching goddamn every time someone touches him aye aye aye
Nick yo vids be lit but Ngl Carlos and the guy with the beard is trash and if we ever played and they got in my face please let me run they fade
We all love los but he ain’t savage squad starting 5 material

Cam busted multiple shots in Nick mouth

Bro that blonde guy is garbage
Cam>friga>Chauncey>nick
Dude on the mic commentating is a clown. Hate when people do that shit
Abe Lincoln a fucking hack lmfaooooooooo

Damn, u n** never could play real ball daaaamn 😭😭 All I see is hacking and crying ahaaa Nick is being expose bad this days
gio blew it for them boys ion know why they let him on the team boy shot every time he touched the ball smh
Chauncey need MVP 🔥

Nick be yelling and fussing at his crew lol..shhyttt they better then me cuz I'll be talking shyt back to him when he be fucn up and Abraham trash af .Carlos slow af but better than Abraham lol..Chauncey better than nick no cap
They cheat just keep watching score
Where is the nine points 14:31
Where the 2hype video at
Did anybody see the next game they didn’t give them the point that white tank top made 👀
Chris is slowly becoming the mvp of the team tbh
11-8 dude hit a layup and y’all never gave him his point over Chris ???
Cam busted Nick easily and you can see Nick getting angrier
What about that 2hype rematch ?
6:27 Chris had me weak 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Why is Carlos still playing pick someone besides him
How about the 2hype game?
Tired seeing nick with the same shoes on Bru lol
Bro gio is such a waste of a player
called savage squad but steady callin fouls in pickups ?????😭😭😭
Y’all foul so dammn much it’s crazy lol
Respectfully Carlos needs to shut up he made nothing lol
They would have won if bum ass gio wasnt takin prayers😂
u guys r clowns, grown men acting like children
Nick is a solid player but dude fouls like crazy on ball.. that hand check redirect been a foul 5 years now
Bro you have to get Carlos out of your team Jesus Christ that man is trash and even thought Abraham Lincoln scored crazy that man went like 8 videos without 1 point
mad respect for nick this vid
At 1,000,000 subscribers play one of the ball is life squad
Cam got ice in his vein. Bro him and Friga needa get their 5. ❄️❄️❄️
Y’all boys to raw 😂🔥🔥🔥
God i feel legit stupid when Carlos speaks
ok without gio, tik timers would have won, and carlos is annoying af and sucks
Anyone know who that black guy with the TikTok shirt on is.? Bro can hoop.

Savage squad vs ball is life east cost or west cost
CAM FRIED YOU
That boy Cam was cooking this nigga Nick so bad LMAO
So Carlos dnt look like choppa @7:30
zero bounce needa be in one of these
nick was foulin😂😂

Nicks holds on defense the whole way then calls bitch fouls 😂
Flight and Gio crab dribble packages
Pull up to nova scotia me and my boys breaking that win streak on God
Nik you fouled that kid like 100 times
I like this new abraham.....Straight rambo mode
But in the red shoes gains his Hall of Fame Menace To Society Badge.
Bro they can call nothing but u guys all of it but actually all clean but u guys just suck
Y’all energy recently is wack.
They cheated the score
Bruh Carlos says he a Ape but didn’t score a single bucket 😂😂 literally gets carried every game. Got all that 5 dollar fit for no reason. Talks all that trash & can’t back it up 🥱
They had Gio… ofc they lost.
Only thing Gio is good at is taking L's.
Chucky be playing like that short kid newman lmao
tha funniest part about this video was the fact that the anime dude was dribbling so fast going NOWHERE when he couldve walked past carlos every time....LOOOOOOOOL carlos moves like someone inside controlling his body movements, always a couple seconds late
Chauncey could solo they whole team 😭🤝
I fuck with y’all but y’all foul a lot I’m not going to lie
Bro cam makes the most craziest shots but he’s a baller tho
Shit Briz and his boys are pVssy. Never really fighting.
Bro Abraham just the hype dude. I wanna deck that man in the face so bad. Be be chirping I’m like that after shooting 3/4 on open 3’s from the corner like 🤣
Cam is a BUCKET😭 that fadeaway in the corner was tooougghh🐐  Edit: watched til the end. And if that is true and he shows up… BRUUHHH😭
Bet you nun of them got hands talking crazy like that
Tiktok prolly would’ve won if they would’ve played 4v5 and cut Gio 🤣
What tf is Gio doing?
Bro this Abe dude is trash. He hugs the dude and saids all ball
What happened to the 2Hype rematch?
I’m not gonna cap I like the savage squad but Carlos talks the most trash and still is trash
2nd game nick couldn’t guard cam 🤣 bro was getting splashed after splashed
“Nigga you got on a 5$ jersey” they be bullying Carlos lmao
Carlos talked crazy but had no points😐
Y’all r cringe balls
This shit so bad, all they doing is hacking and talking shit
Kid with the blonde hair needs to shoot closer. Maybe he could make 2-10
idk who’s playing style i hate more carlos or gios. they both so ass 😂 Carlos saying “i’m a ape” like u can’t even dribble the ball down the court got the handles of toddler 🤣
I love Carlos but honestly y’all lose games because of him😂 he does have those lucky shots tho
Nick Briz team got excuses for everything lmao
Bro Carlos needs to shut up when he ain't making any shots both games
HEX coin is extremely desirable to the wealthy! $0.37
Dude GioWise hit 1 for 12 on threes and thinks he’s cold
Savage Squad is the best squad hands down
gotta love it when carlos talks but has 0 points both games lol
Cam really hit that shot in Nicks mouth. That was like some Kobe gamewinner shit
Only reason I watch these vids is cause u show the whole game. Y’all r mad disrespectful, foul every play argue every call, talk mad shit for no reason and play victim. Cringe af and nick u fouler miss matching shoes on every play
Might have to play my next gane in mismatched shoes and low socks, tryna hit those shots like Cam.
Cam was bustin Nick ass 😂 that boy is unguardable at times
Bro your whack you ain’t getting no where near that goal
Where the fuck that 2hype match at 600k?!
Can u kick Carlos off the team dudes just mad annoying u would win like 98% of the games u lost if u had a better shooter than his trash ass on god dudes acting like he’s doing sum man didn’t even score in this video
Carlos was talking mad shit byt didnt score a point , he is all talk
nick wasnt talking too much shit that game , its rare to see that .
is that ryan?
get rid of carlos and sign your matchup nick bro is buckets and can dribble no offense carlos.
Abraham Lincoln hugs on defence then continues to say all ball
that blonde dude got pity on his jump shots. sometimes it just goes in knowing damn well it shouldnt
I'd leave the park with every dollar in those losers pockets. And Chris you are one of the softest "big guys" I've ever seen. You act so big, you aren't even big 🤣🤣🤣. Get some humility in your life
The one thing i can consistently say about this videos is carlos talks the most shit for no fckn reason
I don't care who's playing, if that shaggy blonde kid is playing, it's a mando thumbs down.
Carlos always be talking the most shit and be doing noting the whole game😂
Didn’t get one pass or shot off in the last game lol whack
Abraham gotta go
fye vid but umm yall cant be doin all that wit bronny yk lebron aint playin ts lmao
why is the camera work getting worse with each vid?
this is the 1st time ive seen bearded dude score three times in one game.
Cam is literally Nick's dad. Son'd him all day
Bro lets be honest. No one can say savage squad plays clean defense with a str8 face lol
Where was nick brickz against cam??😂😂
I know who the worst tiktok shooter is after watching this😂😂😂😂
Carlos is trash he needs to be dropped from the team
What’s y’all excuse now?🤣🤣🤣
carlos had 0 point and still act tuff💀
Idk who's more useless Gio or Carlos they are both garbage ass players need to learn how to drive and the dude with the beard is straight dookie too finally starts to score and brags and has shit defense
Carlos all bark and no bite
Gio Wise single handedly loses both games for them
cam>savage squad
Carlos is trash nick you wanna be a fighter but your not golly gee and your big man thinks he’s superman on lil players 100# under your weight.  Lol screen like girls when they finally make a bucket.  Nick you ain’t that dude.
Need a new fucking cameraman
Chauncey looking like AI vs Jordan out there sheeeeshhhh
Gio is throwing pebbles 🤣
NBA players would pull up and Carlos would still talk shit
Big boy needs to stop shooting them 3s. Shit just outside the paint in general. He’s hurting his team more then doing anything for them.
its like blonde dude good and trash at the same time. Im not tryna call him good or anything but........
That gio kid was trash. All flash no substance. Couldn't take the ball to the rack and just jacked up 30ft 3 pointers. He was so predictable it became boring.
My mayne in the beard hit a shot.. this video is cursed 😂😂😂  12:10 now and he makes another shot this some paranormal activity now  13:23 now and beard nigga make a third shot in one video I’m speechless 😶
y’all notice the points didn’t change from 11-8 to 11-9 when dude made the layup on chris
Bro Carlos is like an downgraded draymond green with no defense
Now the whole channel is about chris picking fights and now even ab trashtalking and hugging people... lol they r just gonna continue cause people like watching for fights.
Idk where they play at because a lot of places not going for all that out of pocket talking😂
Cam the best hooper and gio is actually horrible
They treat carlos like a stepchild 😂
Carlos is trash asf I’ll bet anything that I’ll beat half the team 1-1
All ball and my mans be huggin
That boy with the bond hair trash 🗑 NO CAP
7:55 nick travel :D
Carlos Sucks 🤣🤣
The dude with the beard averages 2 points, 0 rebounds, 0 steals a game and talks the most shit lmao
Idk I feel like all those shots were luck but skill at the same time 😂
You did at 600k
What happened to the 2hype rematch ?
bro cam be fucking shit up no cap 🙏🏾 gotta pick him up, carlos gtg ...
how does anyone like these people?
Bro you need to get rid of Carlos bro he's trash. His defense is worse then his shooting
bro Carlos is annoying and he sucks
Lmaoo homie said “Yrg in building” dassss rightttt twen ☝️
Embarrassing
How y’all make tik tokers look more like able, like y’all really making me support gio💀
No one wants Carlos to have the ball 😂
Gio has a high ego. Like step in. At this point you straight praying. You good but like you ain’t steph
Can we just start calling them Hack Squad? 😂
I’m just gonna be straight up, nick isn’t good as y’all thinks, cam literally cooks tf outta him every game. Chris is literally terrible, Carlos is straight trash, and fake beard man is a bucket. y’all talk a lot of trash to play nobody’s
Put Cam on Nick's squad and it's game over for everyone. He balling out the last 2 vids by himself.
Chauncey talkin shit to cam when he’s not even guarding him…. But cam is waiting for y’all and hitting shots in y’all mits
🔥🔥
that tall curly headed dude gave a look to the camera like he was making a tik tok fam no girl watching this gonna side with you my boy BRIZ TEAM ALL THE WAY
Is that really his beard?
Gio is way too selfish. He lost them both games and I hope they let him know it afterwards. (I feel like this would’ve been way more competitive if he wasn’t here.)
A couple of good players but mostly Terrible basketball!
Nicks squad is the best at talking shit !!
Your going out sad Cam owns you
The other team maybe would’ve had a possibility of winning if they aint have that trash ass boa gio 😂😂
i like how nick's team never admits they foul lol
Carlos actually pisses me off, dude didn’t score one point and is calling other people trash
blond dude doing all that unnecessary dribbling to be 2 and 19 from long range, lol
Carlos is HORRIBLE
🔥🔥🔥💙💙
carlos really think he tough lmfao. hella quite when them niggas was on his ass in tampa lol.
Why start all these fights and then not show the footage? Scared we gonna see one of y'all rocked and get laughed out the YouTube bldg?
abraham playing like rambo out there!
What happened to that 2hype rematch
Cam was giving Nick BUCKETS OMG😳 he stayed quiet the whole game became Cam's bitch😭😂
NICK CAN NOT PLAY DEFENSE WITH HIS HACKING ASS!!!!!
Abraham hugs people and then yells lock up
Even Gio has a better shot than nick 😂 crazy
I thought we were doing 600k and u played 2hype?
You should link wit k showtime
We need that, K Showtime vs Nick Briz
Where’s the 2hype rematch
If I’m picking 1 of the 5 boys on nicks team to be on my squad I’m picking Chris every time. He bring the real energy and doesn’t have any big weaknesses in his game
The more you watch these guys the more you respect the way Friga plays the game
these tiktokers can hoop though
13:49 Chris's face lmao
Like how nick respects when someone is good.. shot out to cam the guy can ball.. gotta drop Carlos though. Weakest link and the whole world knows it
The game would’ve been over a long time ago if this kid didn’t brick 20 half court shots
cam is a beast!!!
you got shitted on dude
What happened to the 2hype video at 600k?? Just all talk?
Nick got his shit cooked like 5 times😂😂
Football players vs tik tokers
Dude how is Carlos on this squad? He’s horrible.
nick couldnt guard came to save his life
Nick yall are trying to start some shit all the time. Come to play and keep your damn mouths shut. Let your ball playing do the talking. But yall still kicking ass
No foul at 1601 Chris play ball
Gio was highkey selling hard ash. He shooting them halfcourt shots every time like he be hitting them.
Nick how the fuck them shoes holding up so long
Savage squad foul too much
So much negativity on the court it’s crazy
Where’s the 2hype rematch ?
cam really made this man nick humble LOL
Carlos is garbage he's dead weight. Nick playing 4 against 5 every game
off brand nav finally hitting shots... scary hours
Cam be bussing y’all if he had a good team y’all would lose 💯
Cam is better than Nick but GG 😭
Nick fouling whole game😭😭
Chris wants to say the n word so bad I just know it 😂
I'm convinced Gio never played basketball 🏀🤣
you’re cam’s son fam
The next video needs less hugs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Carlos is the new flight reacts
Cash gon love this one
Trash
Carlos trasg
I love my dawg chancey but tbh ritzyralph will beat tf out of him
Gio fucking sold
Gio sold so badly
This the second video the lightskin dude with mix match shoes gave y’all buckets
Carlos had a bad performance. Should have been benched.
Come to Newport News virginia and hoop we will end that streak easily y’all might not score over 7
Nick sucks can’t play d fouls all the time
9:49 in his face
Damn Gio type player just hold your team back. Just launching bricks after the team gets a possession.
Carlos is ass, you see that shitty pass...and this is the first time I seen bearded dude drop 3, 3's in a game...he's lucky to make 1
Carlos telling someone they have a terrible ass shot is funny asf to me. At this point it's really just 4v5, Carlos is doing absolutely nothing
This video is cringe man. Nick was trash, spent more time yelling at his own team than scoring. His whole team acting like bitches honestly.
Recruit Cam to the team💯
Tik Tok had a better team just no passing
Carlos needs to get replaced by a real shooter like Cam, Carlos ain’t shit fr fr give him the water boy position !! Asap
That dude with the witness protection beard annoying asf
Y’all peep how the dude who’s usually always tryna be so tough cause he bigger then most dudes be quiet when a dude just as big as him starts talking shit to him 😂
Bro get abe Lincoln off the team bro🤦🏼‍♂️
TikTokers would’ve won if they never had that guy who was launching prayers
Gio shooting from the hip like a mid school kid trying to get it there. Scared to get within 5ft of the three point line 🤦🏻‍♂️
Till this day...I don’t understand how people let Carlos talk press them like this. Never in life would I let THIS DUDE press me like this lol
chauncey carried tf out of yall
abe finally hit some shots and think he trey in the playoffs
That’s the most silent I’ve ever heard Carlos 😂😂😂
Gio is absolutely garbage juice no 🧢 this fool doesn't know the definition of a good shot
I just found Carlos Tik tok shits funny asf
Damn 10:00
Curry raising a bunch of " live by the 3 die by the 3 players" lol
That blonde chick worse than Julian Newman
E man hit some nasty 3s no cap
I need to see East Coast Ballislife Squad vs. the Savage Squad
They need to guard my boy chancy he a sniper
chauncey had a field day
Nick no disrespectful but bro you gotta stop using yo hands on defense bruh that ain’t defense
If that little kid threw the ball at my face I would throw my fist at his
bout time he posts 🔥😤
worst vid yet
Carlos talk so much for being the worst on the team
Carlos didn’t do shit he needs to stfu and needs to be dropped
i would smack tf outta carlos if he said anything to me
how does carlos talk the most shit and when hes the worst at the park....
Cam went dumb 🔥
Nick has to get rid of Carlos and Abe Lincoln looking ass dude. They both are straight trash. Carlos has his streaks but consistency is better than hot streaks IMO.
if nick just LEARNS how to YELL FOUL when he drives they will get the ball every time
Question is… why is gio wise there 😂he can’t hoop
Ocky the best player out there
Brh they all varied Carlos
8:43 wtf gio what is that dude
Nick probably lasts 1 minute in bed like his dad.
2 games no points Carlos
Yall barely beat a team with gio wise throwing up garabage shots the entire time.... These dude really are trash
I like the credit you give at the end to cam and them that was cool
Everyone is improving except Carlos
“Grabs defender”  “That was all ball”😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🇨🇦🇨🇦🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💯💯💯💯💯💯
carlos and his other teammate talk more than they play lmfao both garbage
So we gon talk about at 14:30 that dude scores and they give da points
Nick stop fouling
cam can shoot but is nowhere on defense he never gonna beat nick if he can’t defend
Chris stop walking bro lol
Play real comp!! Playing trash teams, play actual competition!! Friga 5 vs you’re 5. Grand on Friga !
Bro made 3 3's in the last 20 videos and out there talkin shii like hes LeBron 😂  Nick can't play defense without fouling either 😂
I swear Carlos has some kind of disability😂😂
Carlos didn’t even score a point loool
14:55 Na he can’t be serious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love when they go yeaaaaahhhhhhh💀👍
Let's all be honest here, Chauncey and Big Chris keep this engine running. Chauncey is a savage and Chris keeps the inside game on lock. With Beard and Carlos you never know each game if either will even score a single bucket.
Chauncy doesnt know how to run fast break 2 on 1 lmao messed up carlos and nicks assist and OMG 15:22 that shot was fucking crazy
Carlos is so bad
I’m dead he said that’s no a foul when he’s hugging him
Nick got cooked the whole game smh
Can wilder and gio wise in the same team ???!!!! When they gunna 1v1
Tik tok dude with the blonde hair thought he was Steph/Dame shooting that deep lol
GIO FUCKING SOLD ERRYBODY ONNA TIKTOK
aye that boy abe went off, cash can’t say shii abe better than him💀
it should be 11-11
Chauncey a W
Aye Chris turnin into an MVP you can tell hes workin his ass off, much respect my G 💪.... fuck is you talkin bout
CHRIS A DIFFERENT BREEED😭
Chris can’t go a game without talking crap to someone 🤦🏾‍♂️
Dammit, nik getting cooked all day, wussup with the hater name dropping Friga? Briz team is trash and they cry about every little call.
Wasn’t the 2Hype rematch at 600,00?
Nick and Carlos are so buns 😂😬
Chauncy and Chris are just dickheads with insults, pathetic smack talk
17:18 what kinda defence is that about all ball
CARLOS and GIO need to retire, They are straight 🗑.   they each play scared, shoot it from anywhere, make 1 out of 7 shots and act all tough and loud when they do, Other than that, you don't here either of them.  especially THUMBHEAD CARLOS.  🤦🏽‍♂️
Y’all looked a mess out there
It’s crazy how the 2 guys who barely touched the ball were talking the most shit
abe lincoln really is useless he barely does anything on the court, hes the loudest tht talks shit then when its time to fight he disappears
dam if cam accepts a permanent spot in nicks squad then its bye bye abe lincoln lmao
iman or whatever his name is needa get benched asap
Pick up Cam when you play Friga so the match up can be even alittle
How many points Carlos? Hahahaha
talk about getting carried by Chauncey .
9:46 nick got so heated on this play bro 😭
k showtime will give your team the first l
k showtimes squad will shi on yours
watchin gio play annoys the fuck outta me LMFAOAOAOAOAO .   why do they even keep passin em the ball 😭
Ralphinaaaaaaaa
Nick your team is the only team that talks trash they there having fun and u guys are acting ghetto I used like vids but not when ur trash talking humble people like gio cam and friga and also cam cooked your ass also tall boys foul way to much bro and then when u guys get did u guys make sorry ass excuses
Guy in the white vest looks like Trent Alexander Arnold
I’m saying once and I’m saying it again they ain’t good nick can’t shoot or play d and the other players just there I respect them but naw they ain’t good at all and they cry about every call just play ball
cam and dude with black tiktok shirt best on court if we being honest
Somebody tell Savage Squad to sign me . I'll take Abe spot . lmao
Wtf chinese guy just shooting from half court ...
Gio gets 1 shot for 15. Get happy
Need to get rid of Abrahams sorry ass. Yes he made 3 baskets here but before today you need to go to the archives he sorry and corny. Doesn’t do shit for the channel. You should drop him and get homeboy you named at the end where you said he can go play with you. Your team and content will be better also. Abram and his beard gotta go!
4:00 Carlos built like an Youngboy fan😂
gio is so bad LOL
Did Carlos even score
Came across Carlos TikTok the other day… that boy definitely had lunch an hour earlier then everyone else in high school
Carlos so booboo it’s hilarious
Buddy was COOKING Nick
Nick yaw find a way to play that weak ass dude from Canada dude swear he tuff
Cam just made Nick his son😭
Carlos shouldn’t even be allowed to talk trash with how bad he is lmao
yo shoutout nick for being noticeably nicer to the squad
Man I would love to knock out Carlos
Yo you cam and Chris ….. I don’t think the other 2 slots matter that’s a dub
they gotta recruit mismatch shoes, he nice wit it🔥
I don't know about y'all but it didn't seem like they wanted to fight to me. Seemed more like they were tryna bust a move
So, Chris is a bigger joke than Carlos!  That's hard to do.  That guy launches a three in your face, and you're so embarrassed, you run to the other end and force a shot like a child who got his feelings hurt.  C'mon, grow up, you're better than that.  You're turning basketball into an absolute circus sideshow.  It's funny and sad all at the same time!  Good job though!
I bet Abraham Lincoln been doing steroids cause ain’t no way 😅
Them tiktoker dudes soft as hell they scary asfk
That foul Chris called late was so soft. Whenever he doesn’t make that lane hook shot he just calls foul
some dude deadass moaned on 4:22
😂😂 Carlos talks a lot of shit for being a trash ass player
Dude went full KOBE mode 9:54
The way Nick piss gallops is hilarious
bruh abraham is so tiny lol
come to kc brodi
Nick hand checked and hacked cam every dribble
Why does everyone keep going to this busty ass court
Savage squad gotta stop hacking they deadass be pushing people
y’all got chauncey acting like an ass hole too now? smh
Lol that one dude from the tik tokkers is almost as bad as Carlos
bro i dont understand why carlos talk so much when he barely score some games lmao
Y’all are as* Fr y’all call stupid shit and then when you foul them you guys act like nothing happend
I like carlos bc he funny but he pissin me off with him thinking hes good. “You havent been scoring” carlos u havent scored once the whole vid
Nick that foul you called at 10:06 was soft
I think all of them just found out what cocaine is in the last 3-4 videos lmao
Notice how nick isnt talking too much trash this game?
I don't think I saw one possession where Nick's team didn't hack.  Nick is literally hugging people on defense.
I think Carlos is slow
Carlos is more there for the show then for is talents at basket
Nick u fouling
Cam for Abraham and two first round picks
Carlos gotta have some sort of special needs man
tik tokers ruin everything bruh. first music now basketball, they finna ruin video games next
If nick swapped out Abraham Lincoln for cam they be elite
Wow I see Abraham finally scoring points.
Yo cam put on the clamps on nick loll
Carlos been playing better but most of the time he in no position to be talking like that😭😭
anyone else notice jdub customs
Carlos…. bro shut up you didn’t even score😂
Carlos is so bad
Everybody on tik tok team scored can't say the same for carlos
“ on YO mamma!! “ 😳 👊
Oh yea yall getting bussed
Cam cold ❄️🥶 like damn.
get rid of the announcer
fuckin mini mouse 😂
Nick do the same weak ass move😂
find someone to replace carlos . dude doesnt do anything besides be all talk. you can tell he wanna be hard so bad 😭 he’s absolutely useless
Nick and Gio out there having a contest who has the most awkward jump shot
Abrahams defense is all fouling and so is carlos
Abraham for Cam
16:56 the shot was off way before chris hit cams arm 😬
Cam was fucking Nick up
bro cam got sold like wtf and if he was playing with friga again they prolly would have won even tho it would have been a 3v4
Who else agrees they should play one of the balls life team
why was gio shooting
Cam was cooking nick
Amp and kick genius (duke, Chris, Jon family, jay jones, tre good)
Bronny James & Faze pulling up that’ll be lit
Y’all grown men tryna fight teenage tiktokers
Nick briz’s team has become the thing they used to clown on, fouling the whole time then calling ticky tac fouls
Can we get carlos the fuck outta here
I wanna see ballislife east coast against these guys  Already imagine slime dunking on that fat dude
Y’all call baby fouls 😹
Carlos is so wack I swear
Gio is really trash
“I’m like that” after 12 vids straight of struggling to make wide open 3s and maybe scoring 1 bucket a vid if he lucky 😂
replace 0-18 for Cam
That boy Abraham came to play today okay LMAOO
Please don’t fight bronny Nep
that man said “ On yo Mama”😭😭
Dude carlos literally did nothing the first game
Carlos
Parlos talks all that shit and is sorry as fuck
"all ball" mans literally giving his defender a hug
Carlos was talking so much shit but didnt score once
Tiktokers wanted TO FIGHT there was no danm fight smh🤦🏾‍♂️
Faze is gonna win sorry
I always look forward to seeing Nick being disappointed in carlos
Abraham is trash
Abraham Lincoln scored this video
yo carlos suck asf who agree 😭🤚🏾
Carlos didn’t make one not one bucket
why does and1 not count as a foul? same shit
this was a top 3 nick briz games but why tf carlos talking so much shit😭😭he got the ball twice and missed both times lol
How does gio use 20 dribble moves to go backward
That dude Carlos certified bum, talks all game doesn’t do shit on offense or defense
Y’all notice how without screens and fast breaks nicks team would damn near be scoreless 😂
Chris ain’t nothing but a bully. I would like to see him go against some real street ballers
Let’s go Supercuts. Lmaooo
Nick yo that was some game . My favorite part is when you talk on the balcony because the games are over. You should jump off of it too.
i live for nick briz vids 🐐🙏
Carlos chats the most but he barely get points. Brick after brick lol
Carlos trashhhh
Chris is definitely one of the most consistent hoopers on YT. I mess with bro
Bruh fuck yo 700k, you act like it’s all love but you and your teammates call out their game and their character while playing, y’all act hard but ain’t like that, you’re ruining streetball
Abraham did great and seemed he had a tough matchup
Who the orange shoes dude he cold lowkey
It’s crazy how there’s a lot of “niggas” being thrown around but not a lot of actual black people saying it 😂😂
bro carlos didnt score the whole time hahahahahahahahahaha
Nick briz is a goofy who won't come.to chicago 😪😪
Patrick mccaw so annoying, cringe
i need someone to just rock carlos’s shit next time they play at a park
i swear cam is the only good hooper in this video besides the dude with orange shoes but cam giving nick buckets
Gio is the worst basketball player I ever seen
Bruh Carlos didn’t even score the entire vid and he was saying guy in black shirt wasn’t even scoring when he had like 5
HAHAHAHHAHAHA
Bro isn’t carlos a latino saying the n word smh 😂
9:54 cleanest fade away I’ve seen in a while
Only here to drop a dislike for my boy Friga
Carlos ain’t shit man how df you got all gear but no type of game whatsoever
Bronny no they foul to much
Nobody: Not a single cell: GIO: Down 14-7 I will go ahead and airball a half court shot. Lol. Respect Gio though ggs all
Carlos gotta catch one good fade he don’t even be scoring to talk like he do
Cam was putting up in nick face lmao
Abraham Lincoln finally scored more than two and said I'm like that🤣🤣🤣
its funny how savage squad has all these mouths running and still get buckets scored on them. carlos makes no buckets but has the audacity to yell in people faces. what a joke
Kid with the bleach blond hair is garbo.
Why wannabe ninja boy look like he got a strap on beard
Carlos is a goof🤣🤣
Can went crazy asf
I never see Abraham Lincoln make so many shots in a vid
Can they play the real tiktok hoopers
They be holding and don't get any calls
nick brick*
3:59 wtf Carlos doing he been getting worked whole game 😂😂😂😂
I know Everybody see them filing them and not getting any calls at this point this is just jail ball
bruh I swear you miss the most layups ever
Your fouling Cam every time he get da ball…. You can’t guard him
double middle finger was so cringe
Chauncey and cam were the best people on the court
Why Carlos built like Patrick Star 😭 bro so aggressive and uncoordinated
Abraham said "all ball" proceeds to hug mans for 5 seconds straight lmao 😂
They also shot a lot of deep threes but gg y’all did win
9:38 dude with ugly beard: “that’s lock down”. No you literally grabbed him and hugged him
Alto salame ese Carlos jaja
Abraham went off
Nick is just athletic
Only good/decent people r Chris Nick and Chauncey
Honestly if Carlos was replaced by someone that plays great defense this team would be 🔥
Cam Wilder really a hooper!
Yo nick the next time u go back to that court tell me cause i wanna watch ya play
Beard really be talking stuff like he does anything lmao
Nick’s squad is full of clowns 🤡
Come to the chi with all that big teething end result going to be bad for yall
Damn Nick. You and your team are becoming more and more unbearable by the day
Is it wrong that "WANTED to fight" isn't good enough for briz vids anymore?
Yooooo add Cam and drop Carlos, that boy is dead wieght
What's up with the tweaker throwing up half court shots all the time?
Back in Mingo huh nick, I swear the best 5vs are there
Abraham with the career high 6 points sheeeeeeshhhh🥵🥶🥵🥶🥶😡🥶😡
A fan here from Singapore 🇸🇬 ...man you guys crazy 💯😂
Whys that one little guy with the blonde hair just stand in one spot doing foot fires and dribbling really fast but going no where??
The white guy on nicks team with no shirt literally does nothing yet talks shit lmao.....8:47 doesn't even want the ball 🤣🤣
Chauncey was very animated this video , guess it’s the fame
i bet y’all won’t bring y’all ass to chicago talkin allat tough shit😭😭💯
Why Carlos talking bout air balls lmao bro hits the side of the backboard every video 😂
gio was selling he just wants to be the star of the game 😂
I think Carlos might have ADHD or something... ain't no way a person can talk that much shit, if he was good then its understandable but the dude didn't make any shots though
Does anyone actually enjoy watching the dude with the beard , he don’t really do anything he hits one shot every like 3 videos and he ain’t entertaining
Not the dude that be wit kervo dolo
best dude on the team is the big man. Nick Briz play like a football player, no touch at all. Carlos would get two pieced just for being the no effort/energy nigga that yells. His own team don't want him handling the rock lol. These dudes pick and choose who they want to play. Like, how in the fuck do you play Friga, but he has to play with randoms?
Gio is officially trash he blew that game smh
Dude really said AND1 is not calling foul but him saying check ball is calling foul wtf these n*ggas know where to try bs and where not too 🤣
Nick anybody can play with you guys. You have Carlos on the team 🤣
Cam is different
Nick be fouling like crap
Nick got taken to school
to nick: for the love of god PLEASE drop carlos and abe lincoln theyre holding u back.. we got one dude throwing the ball away for turnovers and the other straight fouling and hugging dudes saying "ALL BALL" even stevie wonder can call that foul any day. smh
Why was Carlos talking shit he ain’t do shit in the game 🤣
gio is horrible oh my god. shoots like a 4th grader in PE i swear.
p.p.s. abe lincoln had a career high for being 3 of 4 for 3pt FG. mans never gonna achieve that stat again.
I'ma say this now cris is unstoppble
p.s. carlos looks like a goldfish and a stretched muscle
idk whats giowises major brain malfunction but this dude needs to stop shooting deep 3's... mans was 3 for 12 and acted invincible
Abraham think he intimidating 😭😭😂😂
Is this the new Detroit Bad Boys?
I liked how u play this game nick u where chill
faze finna bring ben simmions on they 5v5 team i think he part of faze
It really is 3v5 every game 😂
i cant wait for 1 day when there is a big that will bully chris the whole game
I think you can still get the views now without posting "Fight" in the subject line. Nobody out there wanted to fight lol
y'all are getting disrespectful, doing the same stuff to people that y'all stay bitching about smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
That man sounds like such a whiner @11:58 . “ go to the rim!” Lol More like, you need to observe your boy better
carlos talks so much and hes shit
Yea no respect and they ain’t ballers.
Carlos needs to shut his face lol no points. Props to the other team, pulled out some sick moves and shots.
Nick was chill this vid
Nick always saying “same thing on both sides” then call your shit stop bitching
I don’t get the applause for going like 2-12 from half court.
They rubbing off on Chauncey too much lol he’s becoming a dickhead
Dat boy cam is a bucket
The more I watch nick briz the more I hate him. They complain about getting fouled when they literally cant play defense without holding and hand checking. On top of that he got his squad and act like he's so good. This vid he scored 3 points the whole game I think, Cam had him on lock. They trash talk so much after scoring one points like calm down, If you play in an organized league you would get balled on.
Nick was getting cooked
So they cheating again. Scores a bucket on Chris but scores stay at 11-8? This like the 2nd time.
The nolstalgia and new content. This is why nick is the best !
I fell like if Gio actually trained and was smarter with his shot selection he might actually be so good
Gio just throws up a shot and prays it goes in 😂
Nick looked back at this footage & said “shit I need Cam on my team before Friga pick him up”😂
this getting sad when someone wanna fight you every vid im starting to think you're the problem
Anyone else only here cause you already watched the ball is life and dfriga videos?
The blonde dude has the strangest playstyle I have ever seen: Moving his feet like a hurricane to fire those Steph Curry range 3s with a weird ass shooting technique.
Chris has made massive improvements in his game. He’s been carrying the team in big moments the last few months!
Carlos is ass no doubt worst player I’ve ever seen
Carlos is so cringe
What about 2 hype
Blonde kid is legit awful
All five of them would foul out in a regulation game 😂
Carlos always talking shit but trash asf 🤣🤣🤣
U can’t hold cam
Chris is talking his talk, and he can back it up. You just can’t call foul on every shot you get bodied on
Nick Brit has the most clickbait videos tiktokers wanted to fight, even though savage squad always starts it
Y’all should turn the unnecessary shittin talkin down foreal it’s irritating
BRO NICK STOP TRYNNA RIG THE GAME I CAUGHT YOU MESSING WITH THE SCORE
I swear I been watching this channel for like 5-6 months now and Abe Lincoln scored more points in this video than he did in the 6 months combined I’ve been watching
Someone needs to lay Carlos the fuck out
no cap nick got a worst jumper than carlos
Dollar tree beard made more shots in this video than all the other videos combined😭. As in Iman, he’s trash
Lol Carlos is so goofy, yelling that he's an ape at the end....
What's wrong with Carlos?
*Chris talks shit to Bronny*  *Bronny gets LeBron*  Chris: Fuck
This dude needs to realize this isn’t 2k shooting half court shots
When they had 8 y’all didn’t add the point from the layup ole dude made on big blu
Nobody could hold o boy so they kept fouling him all game long smh.
This title should be labeled "Chris trying to fight everyone"
Why did they pick the blonde hair kid he’s awful
Why long hair Julian Newman shoot like that
That kid guarding Chris can take your spot and so can the little Asian one Carlos you would be shit out of luck to lol
Carlos talks too damn much he needs to focus on making at least one shot🤣🤣
Carlos your not an ape lol
Carlos is a ban
Gio Flight and Carlos in a game of 21 who y’all got???
cam was doing nick the whole video but gio wise had to sell the bag don’t know why they even picked him up
For Carlos Being Absolute Trash. He’s The Biggest Shit Talker No 🧢
Cam got a strap dang
Bruh dude with the beard cashin now😈
C nul
Please come to Philly I’m tired of watching this bullshit competition
Abraham needs to stop talking and do something sheesh and we all thought carlos was bad Abraham a ghost we all forget about dude bc he legit does nothing. i guess there's a first for everything im dead
That little girl who was more concerned about his dribbling skills lol
Brony don’t fuck with y’all bro
I kno dat this streetball  but Gio trash in streetball AND organized wtf is this man doing bruh..?😂😂
This gotta be Beards Career high
I don’t kno who these folks be but if they talked to Alabama folks like that they swinging on madukes
When they checked the ball real fast and Nick was running 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Bro move so weird,  his neck be like 🐪. Great video
Gio sold. This man always shooting from Africa 🤦🏾‍♂️
Still waiting for a 1v1 Chris vs Flight😪😤
Bruh tell Chris to get a post fade and he’ll be unguardable in the paint
Chris really called dat mane Minnie Mouse..🤣🤣🤣🤣
This man chris wanna prove he from ny so bad “fuck is you talkin bout” after every play😂
Cam and Ryan are the only basketball players on that court
Nick has one move only I don’t get why they don’t force right. Bounce crazy unreal tho makes up for it
Nick got destroyed bro 😂 the whole team did
Nick fouled cam every time he dribbled the ball 😂😂 handchecking from hell
Stop playing a bunch of bums in parks come at the legend
That is bull shit you only fouled when they were inside man up play real D
Learn to talk trash without being assholes.  You look like kids out there always saying you wanna fight for no reason.  You’re not like that.
I was wondering why nick was so quiet in this vid lol turns out he was gettin turnt the night before
Ryan Crash Dummy is nice nice
play 2hype me and my friends placing bets
Nick complains like a girl on the court when stuff doesn’t go his way lmao
I swear that's not Iman dude's suppose to get 0 points a game
when nick gets mad it sounds like he crying😂
bro chris with the non stop offensive fouls
Dark green shorts Chauncey is different
Nick really be fouling every play it’s sad that’s not good defense at all 😂😂
Nick did a great job of being floor general that game!
Good to see that Gio is playing better
Why do Bin Ladin talk the most shit on the team
mikey williams>nick 🚮
carlos annoying asl
Nick I fw u heavy but Cam got the best of you this time.
I love how Chauncey said tighten up when he was behind a scene the whole time but shot was good tho . ps sorry if I missed spelled your name
Cam be making some really difficult shots, shit is kinda crazy
Be careful lol can I try out lol
Why is the dude with the beard still here?
stop saying WANTED to fight if they wanted to fight they would have lol
When is savage squad coming to NWF?
chris is trash...no skill just a big man wit a big mouth an no game
Nick is so obviously not even close to best person on his team, let alone the court.  If Cam and Dfriga played wit chall nick would get dropped😭😭
Man these vids be funny asf 😂😂 I watch these cause of the drama frigga way better fr
Nick team need to be humbled they gone learn soon
Oh boy, Carlos is funny as hell
chauncey hanging out with these white boys too much, all “knock you out” talks and not doing nothing about it
Friga's channel is 100 times better. Not to mention better basketball play. Looks like the tik tok team was paid to throw up garbage shots. FRIGA!
Too many clowns on the court. The kid with the bleached hair and red shoes is actually a clown
HUGS HIM AND PROCEEDS TO SAY ALL BALL! HILARIOUS
I gotta stop watching nick briz vids all these dudes sorry at hooping
these videos are so insanely cringe but entertaining
Nick got cooked lmao
HOW IS THAT A CHECK BALL AT 15:57?
I break yo jaw “on yo momma” 💀
Yo Carlos is pure comedy 😂 🗑
You know someone is sorry when all they try to do is go left right left right on the stick and pull up from halfcourt (yes the blonde Asian girl)
Y’all cry and whine more than you play
IS THAT RYANDACRASHDUMMY??!!
Bruh why have Carlos if he can’t dribble 😂 or shoot?? Nigga moral support lmao no defense and for sure no offense trade him for Kyle kuzma man
this dude nick is a certified clown, cant defend without fouling just like his boy with the fake beard who scored 6 points the whole year
Chris so tough and loud until somebody his size pull-up 😂😂😂😂 and Im convinced at this point Carlos is a sped Ed 💀💀😂
Dude with the orange hair white shorts and red shoes had handles but was a trash shooter he made absolutely nothing
Carlos soooo trash to be talking so much trash 😂
Come to the Redlands
Ok if you call and 1 that technically does mean you got fouled lol
This the most I seen bum Eman score any video
GARBAGE! Did you pay those guys to take 40ft jumpers?  Also the fat guy that talks a lot needs to stop calling tiki tak fouls when he pushes off every time he tries to drive.
Can someone tell Carlos he sucks and to stop talking trash when he can’t back it up
nick is a crybaby
Beard so trash 😂😂😂😂
Can someone please beat up the Carlos guy
CAM A FXCKIN DEMON
Cam either makes it or air balls they’re are no bricks just air balls and swishes
Why Chauncey telling my mans to shut the fuck up but he the one hiding behind screens like this is 2k😭
The dude with mix matched shoes literally destroyed nick in his faceeeeee OMG
Carlos talk crazy . Idk how they didn’t smacked that fkn child
Bro nick was left handing the whole first game, idk if he left handed but if he not tbats difficult enough in its own right, but yall just hating nick is actually a good player
Some one need to make that carlos kid shut up he is so bad man cant even lay up a ball yet talking smack like👨🏽‍🦯🤦🏾‍♂️
cam is a straight hooper.
Why is the Carlos guy wearing leggings and a whole uniform
Nick hand checks the fuck out of him gah damn
Why is gio wise even on the court mans got the ball like 3 times
Carlos didnt Score once the whole video 😂😂
get a better team take carlos out😂😂😂😂
if gio ain’t take 100 shots from half court they probably would’ve won the game
Man bring that tough shit to the Lou! Come to STL Gvng
Why the fuck is the guy with the red headband talking?🤣 He didn’t even score a point and he trashtalks hahah
That boi Abraham Lincoln swear to god he built like that😂😂
What happened to 2hype at 600k
5:27 bro, Mclovin???
Nick you to make sure you post this shit fast, your viewing count is going down bcoz other ppl already posted the same content
Carlos has 3 outfits he hoops in. That 2k blue camo done seen some better days
Tik toker in blond hair the type of player that spams the same buttons on 2K and when he finally gets the shot he think he is good. 😆 🤣 😂
chris said “did he really just make that”😭😂
Bird man chris
Abraham went crazy in that second game 👀
Slomo dat he really airballed that shit, Chris ain’t hit his arm till he released the shot💀
I’m not gon lie if gio didn’t take half the shots he took y’all would’ve at least had a closer game 😂😂
Abe Lincoln has to go I say it every time. He doesn’t dribble, he can’t shoot and he’s too short to play D.
Seriously  though, why is Carlos on that team?
bro a random had 6 points lmao
Chris why are you saying “fuck is you talking bout” when no one is talking to you
This looks lik the randoms court on 2k rn
bruh Carlos actually not all there mentally 💀💀
Bro tht guy tht looks like Abraham Lincoln with the beard I dont know why he talking cs he barely makes shots in games😭👎
Abraham has no right to talk boy is trash
Carlos be the worst on the court talking the most shit😭
Gio might be on of the worst basketball players I’ve seen 😂
Ill gladly take Abrahams spot as a REAL spot up shooter 🤣🤣 add another Carlos to the team💪🏼
This is easily the saddest display of basketball i have ever witnessed! Lmao! The fact that you weren't too embarrassed to post this says a lot about you! Sad my guy!
carlos 0 points
Who is this GIO WiSE guy? Watching him play makes me want to Vomit
This man Abraham saying that’s “All Ball” but holding dude’s entire body down every time LMFAOOOOOO
Gio is so fucking bad 😂😂😂
Yall smacked them bruh
bro the beard guy and carlos both trash af but they the loudest
Lost my respect for Carlos talking about Kobe’s shoes disrespect asf not just him to the basketball community
Alright..... Y’all got me.... Y’all trolled me good..... What the F is this 💩? The only dude in this crew who can ball is ..... I believe his name is Chauncey? The rest of this crew looks like the cast of the Goonies.
Buddy with the two different shoes on iiissss good best one the court ☝🏽
Yall suck omm
GIO IS SO ASS HE JUST DRIBBLES IN PLACE AND CHUCKS HALF COURT HEAVES. IF HES ON YOUR TEAM YOUR GONNA LOSE EVERYTIME
🔥🔥
2 things I picked up from this video.. Carlos - The most useless and probably the most stupid of the Savage Squad! Cam is a BEAST😈⚡️🥶
5:13 If u he reaching he teachin FUXK IS U TALKING BOUT
Carlos is literally one of the worst basketball players I've ever seen...man needs to fix his form and his anger issues 💀💀💀
I thought y’all were supposed to play 2hype at 600k subs
I don’t watch these to see good hoopin I watch this bc nick and his team are clowns bro😂😂
Thank God u didn’t wear that dumb ass beanie at the end of the vid 😂😂😂😂
Nick is the definition of a white, uncooked, Caucasian male.
Said it before and I’ll say it again, Chauncey the only one I fuck with out of all of y’all😭😭
17:12 he must be on some off that street crack if he thinks that ain't a foul
Chauncey carried
Only thing Chris needs is to be black, then you got a full menace pack right there😭. No hate though, I like the shit talk though
carlos and abe be doing too much and they dirt it’s not even entertaining anymore it’s just ignorant at this point 😂😂
dude the little blonde Asian kid with the hanging earring was like 3 for 127......and just kept shooting from 447 feet away everytime....wen he would rarely make one celebrated as if hes not the reason his team lost because if he stopped shooting every time guys like cam coulda probably been scoring
Nick can’t guard Cam 1 on 1 cleanly. Gio is still shit. Carlos never scored. Abe Lincoln finally made more than 2 shots in a video.
Dude with the beard so trash idk why he be talking 💀 and Carlos too.
Carlos ain’t even score bro stfu worse on the court
That dude with the gold hair the Asian kid is straight trash lol. All he did was dribble then chuck up half court 3’s lol
Fw the content but none of these niggas would win a 1v1 against friga or Cam🤣
chauncey goated
this man callin 17:15 "all ball" TF   Alper Biçen <3
Cam and nick would be fun
I’d lose my mind playing with Gio shooting them half courts
its always the dude with the fake beard talking shii
Carlos woke up feeling dangerous. Man's went out there and put on a CLINIC. Game 1 0/15 Game 2 0/20 LEGEND 💯 💯💯💯💯 🔥🔥🔥
Cam better than they whole squad 😂
What minute does Gio throw the ball at Carlos face? 🤣
Bro Gio need stop shooting the ball because 1 he not curry. 2 his dribbles is too much. And 3 he like to cross people out just like James harden but he not so I am sorry you suck man. Even Carlos is better than you
nick and carloss are garbage, all nick does is bounce around and carlos cant even dribble with his head up for fuck sake!?....complete garbage!! lol
some people are literally coming  for the briz team, yet KNOWING HOW THE BRIZ TEAM PLAY! At the end of the day, they played well, it's just that the briz team bested savage team in this one. Honestly i hope they wll do this again, Cam is an absolute legend on the court. Same goes for Chauncey, kept cool, and kept some trash talkers in check.
My nigga said “I’m a ape nigga” 😂😂
Bro gio  really went like 2-20
This is the least trash talk I seen kick ever do.
9:44 all ball?!? mans need some glasses 😭😂
That boy can.makes y'all a solid team against anybody
yall gotta drop carlos he is not like that in any sort of way lmao
Chris going stupid
Wtf happen to the 2Hype Vs Savage Squad game?
Bruh tiktokers just got destroyed
when is Lhype rematch
Brawadis squad vs savage squad
Dribble Naruto is literally losing his team games with his BS. Also, Abraham showed up! Credit to him he really played tough defense and hit his shots.
after that shit with duke i lost respect for bruh, clout chasing is dangerous, remember that.
If these clowns played as much as they run their jaws, they might actually make it somewhere.
Carlos just straight stole flight shii
That's the first time I seen Abe Lincoln make a shot
Chris “did he really just make that?”
Fcking carlos..
If there is ever a time y’all come to New York come to Brooklyn. Bridge park
if carlos wasn’t sped i would smack tf outa him
Video suck at the end
Carlos is the worst player I ever seen
Bro cam is fuckin nasty omg
Mans got cooked by cam ngl 😅
Lol they team trash 😂🤦‍♂️
cam wilder gtta hoop wit nick against faze 💯
The whole savage squad are fucking hackers god damn lol this ain't prison ball if ya dont hack ya lose . Plus ya get hacked and quick to call a foul lol lame asf
Aye bro someone gotta tell Carlos and Abe that they not nice with it..
gio, wtf are you even doing bro
Carlos the kid who goes 0-5 on CoD but talks the most shit
Cash need to react to this Abraham shooting them bitches💯🔥
Abe Lincoln made 3 shots on 3 open looks u aren't like that and u foul like shit boy
Carlos needs to go!
At 12:27 u shoulda put that on his head😂
17:28 has me weak. Jungle and the cages 😂
da beard nigga finally play good for once 😂
this man would dribble like his life depended on it meanwhile Carlos is just standing there looking at him lmaoo, all that for what?
First time I ever seen Abraham score more than once lmfao
It's like Carlos and Abraham switched places lol. But for real though Nick we need that 1v1 with Cam.
Nick be fouling like hell after he get hit up‼️😂
Don't piss off Chauncey 🤷‍♂️😂
abraham lincoln finally scored for the first time in like 10 games and thinks he the sh!t
They finessed the score thought nb seen it
Y’all suck bro they close the gap and y’all kept fouling at the end
Why is this blond hair dude shooting like he's lemalo ball lol
Like did you let them get any foul calls for how many you guys called out lmao
Gio sucks take him and Carlos of the court
Brooo, this nigga cam made me stand up while i was taking a shiiii, he is too cold wit them shots
Carlos and Abraham Lincoln do the most talking for being the shittest on the team
Only person good fr is Can
Chris first bucket is always followed by a “fuck is they talkin bout”
why s he shooting frm half court, he blowing mine smh 😂
Y’all defense is getting bad like stop fouling lol ..it’s petty sometimes
I can’t wait till these guys pull up to the wrong hood, talk crazy to the wrong people and get exposed for the pussies they really are. Gonna be a hard lesson learned one day but it’s coming and it will be ugly. I can’t wait though.
17:15 ain’t no way nigga said that’s all ball 😭😭
Can someone make Carlos just humble himself haha he needs to be slapped
Tik tockers dead ass just fuckin around and still beating you guys🤣
Man if savage squad miss a shot it’s a foul I’m done😂
Can yall just play basketball and stop with the fake tough guy shit? Yall keep up with all that talking and yall will get what yall are asking for so before that happens just Hoop and cut out all the other shit.
This video should be called Abraham Lincoln turns up
Cam was going crazy, and Carlos continued to be absolutely useless😂
4:09 barely touches nic bro, then the other team get rapped up and he goes same thing on both ends 🤯🤯
Pls play BIL squad
Whole vid was horrible basketbal
chris is scary😭😭the whole team scary
Nick needs to work on his defense
that abraham lincoln guy is so annoying 😭 he fouls and hugs the whole game and act like he dont and then he talk shit bc he makes a 3 bc ppl forget he on the court
Cam is armed and dangerous 🔫💪
Nick pushes Cam every time Cam goes by him, thats not defense bum.
Idk who missed more shots Carlos or gio
the dude with the white who was guarding chris is nasty this was just a bad game
this one of the most competitive videos ive seen yet… keep up the good work
Anyone who thinks Carlos is still funny is a idiot lmao.  at this point hes just annoying
Nic team much got lot view s off fight video cause now tHey talk to much shit
He got crossed by goo fruity tooty
Carlos the make a wish kid🤣
The TikTokers are obviously more skilled, but played stupid as they got sucked into the terrible basketball rabbit hole as usual with these videos. This stuff is hard to watch.
Come to jersey the sack and I bet ya will lose
Nick briz content is bomb bto love his work everyone  is reacting a cash is paying bills go look at his views even flight
Savage squad pre game meeting: “Alright no one pass it to Carlos, he’s just gonna throw up bricks and embarrass us”
Nick is some shit lol
First jumper chagce has made in like 8 videos
Man at first I enjoyed the videos now y’all just be trying to fight everyone, bitching, hacking, and calling hella fouls. Shit just drama at this point.
16:32 this guy bricks 90% of his shots, i dont even know why pople play on his team.
You TF does Gio wise think he is man said he tries to score a half court bucket every time
I keep waiting for Carlos to bitch slap somebody...LOL
That cam dude
Idc Gio has the ugliest dribble sigs and the jump shot is just a joke itself
binK
Ik who will beat y’all……. I bet y’all won’t play either Ball if life teams, east or west🤷🏾‍♂️
Carlos is just a body on the team. Can’t score, can’t defend but talks mad shit
Jackboy Jackboy Yea that’s yooouuu..😂😂😂.. I see Chris be watching HaHa Davis too..
TicToker
That tik tok dude just throwing up shots and traveling every dribble tf he is not a baller what so ever
Nick got bitched not going to lie
Cringe
Carlos= clown
Gio needs to take a normal shot god damn, ik that boys got a jumper he needs to stop clout chasing
Cant lie nick got cooked and gio was basically playing for nicks team
Chris carried
I feel bad for cam 😭
Dude with the puff Hair on the tik tok team been killing nicks squad 2 vids now
I could never play with the little blonde hair kid that Julian Newman dribbles around then jacks up bullshit ass deep threes … he goes 3 for 1000 then celebrates after making one …🤣🗑🚮
Cam always gets stuck with people who sell the fucking game lmao. Gio blew so many possessions jacking up deep ass shots when he's not like that.
Come To Atlanta Bet We Take Ya Out !
CaM IS DIFFERNT, NICK CANT FW HIM he was scoring right in NICKS FAce everytime. GIO WOULD Be mad annoying to have on ur team, this kids pulling from deep asf like nobody guarding u out there, if u gonna go 2/10.
Not Jdubs in the cut
Y'all need to put a leash on Carlos barking around like a Chihuahua.
Whose the kid that likes to sound like he’s going hard on the turn table. His gameplay literally makes no sense lol
Please get someone to sub in for that arabian ninja turtle bruh he worse than carlos
like no one out there can beat cam and second nick your team play ballislife
Nick team got distroyed this game even if they won lol
gio trash
KSHOWTIME SQUAD VS NICK SQUAD thats what we really want
Do not bring this to FORT MYERS FL, we different down here🔥🔥 I know y'all boys was in other parts of FL, but my 5 against the savage squad? Definitely ending y'all win streak easy.
Little man says I’m like that by hitting two wide open threes lol
Yo nick this my last time telling you let me take Carlos spot
Nah like Carlos is good and all but he acts like he the best whilst he was struggling to score against Gio Wise and then still he was talking shit
Chauncey is a hooper. That is all.
Somebody’s going to sleep Carlos one day he’s the only personality out there that’s not genuine he ain’t really like that it’s all for the cameras FYI if you ain’t out there scorin shut the fuck up.
Team Briz is just a bunch of liars about calls the whole game
Cam needs to start talking shit
The guy guarding Nick shows how to defend him. Play 3-4 steps off him and dare him to shoot. Other end Nick was hand checking him on every drive. The kid shooting 30 foot jumpers killed his team
50k y’all come on 💫⛽️
No lie can’t stand gio, who plays ball like that ? Like frfr
Nick can’t play D. Literally hand checking the whole time, he got cooked
How is Carlos still on your team
Bro if gio would stop with the half court shots and move when he dribbled they might of won a game. It was like 6 on 4 when gio on the team.
The blonde dude is the last person you want on your team. Only iso 3s way behind the line on very suspect percentage and no defense in any shape of form. Good luck to win with that.
gio wise man. like wtf😭
LEGEND
Y’all need to take the mic away from that man, dude is too annoying
Abe Lincoln strikes again!! Straight 🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
“jit”😂
Carlos telling anybody that’s a terrible shot is just unexceptable
Bro y’all r ass 😭 y’all got lucky they didn’t have zero bounce
That man thinks he’s like that cause he hit 3 catch and shoot wide open threes😭
Bruh what are those half court shots/deeeep threes people taking like tf 😂
Gio sold the fckin game
They be watching friga to much yo said thats frigas move🤣🤣
I can respect their team because they winning against people that hoop & they got people like Carlos and Abraham on their team that’s short as hell too. Imagine if they replace them 2 with better players. 11:41 for example lol
Tell Carlos chill out doin dat shit he askin got it 😂
Damn that dude just put carlos jersey on blast 🤣🤣🤣
Nick is the high jump track guy that wants to play bball.   Get that 2 for his name in the paper
The beards new hair cut and bandana powered him up   Gio wise is a trash bag   Calos talking waffle with no points   Tik tokers get smashed amazing video thumbs up as always
Gio is just like Julian Newman. That whole stutter step bullshit is fkn dumb and cringy to watch lmfao
16:10 Chris you beyond TRASH!! You missed ya wack ass lay up & then call foul. You do that all day!
Cash gonna have a field day with this one
hey nick what up bro!... In your stupid face 1 2 3 times the same guy 😂😂😂 go home
Carlos is so ass he just be talking and nobody be paying attention to him
That boy cam ain't no joke
Bruh, quit it with the clickbait titles. You don't need to pretend there's gonna be a fight, people just wanna watch some good games.
Come to Trenton,nj and play some real nigguhs
Honestly I couldn't play ball with Carlos, I would have punched him in his face for calling me a nigga and talking shit when he isn't doing nothing😭. Just couldn't do it. Good video as always tho.
I hope when he plays Friga's team they have refs. They would be in trouble if they do. They were pushing everytime they went to the basket on them. Then the constant trying to fight. They are ruining the game. Shit talking is one thing. Just fighting isn't hooping.
the asian kid doing size ups at half court says tiktoker all over it lool
Carlos got a wrestling uniform on 😂😂😂
this video ain’t do nun for me except further prove me right about how bad Gio really is and how good Cam really is 😂
Chauncey said not on my momma, but YOUR momma
Cut nav and have him to to squabble we need cam in the series
cam went crazy
What happened to 2hype at 600k???
Carlos on steroids and the Muslim guy on steroids. Dudes acne is out of control but they both are trash 🗑
Use the like under this as the I love Chauncey button 😂
Chauncy was on his shit to
Bro when they start losing they just be tryna fight like nigga I’m just tryna hoop fr if he want fight so bad take his ass to ufc
so whats they tiktoks 🥴🥴
These trash talkers "savage squad"  keep running their mouths they got absolutely cooked😭😭. They can only talk and play dirty if u about to win/embarrass them they'll do u dirty. No talent
Please get rid of Abraham. He a bum
nick you cheated score second game it was 11-9 not 11-8 🤦🏾‍♂️
Is no one gonna mention that kid with the blonde bowl cut out there straight tweakin 😆
Nick dont be scared of bronny bro. Yall playin on a level above them
I like balls life. But Carlos talks To much bro😂
Y’all need to get rid Carlos ass
You guys wack
They Ain change the score 😭
Nick, how you hand checking and still getting your shit cooked 😂
You letting a whole bunch of people update this video wayyy before you. Losing a lot of views. I seen this last week
Bruhh carloss stfu u haven’t scored myguy this guys funny
Finally Abrahammmm this what we wanna see
If they didn’t have gio pulling from behind half every time he touched rock they prolly would have won
Just passing through to CLOWN Nick for the way he acts and is negatively influencing young ballers by allowing he and his teammates to incite violence.
nick need to get rid of the amish lookin dude i’ve only seen him score once
carlos was scary
😂😂😂😂🤦🏼‍♂️💩
Lmfao Carlos said we in the jungle
10:37 why they cut that part short when the crowd went crazy?
I’m gonna stop watching these videos because Carlos is a fuckin weirdo. He was for sure in the special classes at school
When’s 2hype rematch??
Carlos trash talking makes me laugh all the time
Cam a savage
Carlos is the cringiest person alive
Bro that light skin in the tang-top is so bad
Did Carlos score
Bruh just saying Carlos didn't do anything but he was talking a lot lol but I still love Carlos one of my favs, badass video
Aye y’all hacking all game. “All ball” grabs him mid air🤦🏽‍♂️ smh
Of course Young Abe Lincoln would put in work on Labor Day
look at gio man
Bro show the happy ending part which everyone show love and respect to each other like before videos dude !
This game showed how bad Chris and nick really are 😂 like they couldn’t guard them or score
So we ain't gonna talk about how gio wasn't taking shit serious the whole time
When do you drop the game againts 2hype?
carlos talk too much he aint doing shit
come to Houston tx
Yo, Cam really a beast!
That gio wise doh
If I was playing with that dude having seizures and jacking 3’s from half court, he would never see the ball again.  That guy is a liability. Even more than Carlos
Carlos you are the worst player dude
We’re the 2hype vid
cam should join the savage squad
You are the biggest dude there and you are the biggest baby there
Didn’t cam have beef with young bull?
Cam was frying Nick
Carlos would for sure be the starting PG for the team USA Special Olympics basketball team.
Why does that lil short Arab kid keep playing with them?? He does nothing but get slapped in the face by crack heads.
That blonde Asian guy was really annoying tho…
17:10 Carlos pls don’t
Carlos should trash talk if he can’t score and has the worst passes
17:20 he hugged him like it was a relative at Thanksgiving dinner he ain’t see in years, and calls “all ball” 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
beard stepping up
Carlos is so trash and his team is cold
Abraham saying I’m like that was the funniest fucking part stg
abraham swears he nice at defense even though half the time he be hacking 😂
Shoutout jdub customs lol
Bro I can’t lie ima be honest if Carlos ever got that close talking all that mess I would rock his shit no cap 😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Chazi is the hardest one out there
KICK GIO OFF THE TEAM!
Nic Squad So Disrespectful To The Game , You Dont Have To Fight Everywhere You Go Bruh 😂 Bet Yall Wont Come To Houston With That . 🤐💯
Light skin was cooking u nick .... but other than that , ya team carried u as well lol u missed bout 5 layups and made 1 two pointer lol . Idk what was up with you but this ain’t the nick we used to my boy
Bro Carlos rode the short bus to school, he’s not all there
No one can stay down with Cris
Nick again did nothing in this video
Man was he trash, that kid with his wet pasta hair. Dribbling 1 hour and missed every shot. So trash
These folks hacked the whole game and swear it's all ball 😂😂delusional ash
Why is carlos so godam bad
Iman needs to get that 10 day contract
So sick of the generation rn that’s like 19 and younger, they are all the same stupid , one note copy cats who are all unoriginal. It’s hard to explain , im 27 and when I was that age we just didn’t act like the kids these days it’s gross.
I still got a sour taste from the last video. 7:32 and you was calling non existing push offs. 17:16 really bruh? It doesn’t matter if one hand is on ball if the other is around his whole waist. Smh Gio sold the game, idk why y’all kept giving him the ball.
Bro why all your videos get 1.5m viewers a you only got 650k subs
Gio handles really insane fr he just don’t use it right
That Gio kid fucking sucks bro why is he throwing up prayers like that
Carlos sucks... didn't make one shot lol... I would love to play vs him
“you gotta dunk that”🤓
Carlos is a Clown and the rest a bunch of bullies, The other team keep it cool. I'm done watching this channel.
Bro on the mic is so lame everytime … just enjoy the game in the crowd bruh
These guys are garbage!!!
Ugh... Imma head out
Love watching these boys ball. But damn they’re obnoxious af
Chris call weak fouls but heck all the time
4:20 “grean beam”🤣 looks like yall dont play 2k lol
Dude with the blonde hair makes 3 outa 100 shots lmaooo.
Carlos Is obnoxious
Ya'll hold too damn much. move your feet.
I hate below average players pretending to be good. The short guy with Nick is half garbage and fouls constantly yet and only hits shots when he’s wide open acts like he’s good.
Never got the fascination with Gio Wise. Same little spastic dribble move over and over then Jack up a half court shot…
Carlos is going to get beat one day 🤣
Gio wise dribbling just to dribble
Carlos is so bad man lmfao
bro who is that dude with his shirt off and that bushy beard. that man is trash. carlos didn’t score a point
which park in soflo is this at?
5:26 McLovin’ was hyped
Why is Carlos still playing with you guy sucks
👎🏾👎🏾
I heard that "YRG in the building" 😎
Chauncey said “On yo Mama”😭😭😭😭😭
Ngl Abraham Lincoln was hacking the entire game 😂
It’s gone get really bad for they squad with all the shit talking they do niggah said tighten up for I break yo jaw lol this is basketball you talking about fighting I’m not gone do no talking get hit with the 40
Carlos be sellin now fr 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ he used to be on his shit when y’all first introduced him to us
Gio wise literally is not a 5 v5 player, he dribbles in one spot and Takes the most dumbest shots
Dam nick u better step up ur game they got you on this one even with the L
Carlos : "Your ass your not even scoring" Also Carlos : Hasn't scored either
how that man gon say all ball both times knowing damn well he fouled him
Gio pretty much cost the team the game with all his deep 3s
tiktokers are more chill in this video lol
Chauncey killing it
17:15 Abe literally grabbin that mans waist and screaming all ball lmfaoooo.. Somebody need to pack up Abe and Carlos off every park run.. they is not hoopers forreal they’re both fuckin trash 😂😂😂 HOF Cheerleader badge
That short fat guy on nicks team is so horrible  “I’m fucking like that” 3 open 3s and your career high
We need segggie, gio, whoever the dude it the black shirt was, cam, and the king of old head tik tok to be the 5 next time
I love your videos nick
Gio wise is terrible
why is carlos wearing all blue camo
No idea who that dude with the goku hair and dribbling tf out of the ball, but he ass and I would not pick him in a 5v5 game. No defense, no play making just selfish brand of ball. Pass
Homeboy had his facemask pulled down the whole game 🤣🤣🤣🤣 bruh stop shaving you mustache and leaving the beard lolllllll
1:02 how do you do a 360 and end up in the same spot
Get Cam on a real team and he destroys. But I don't get what the point of all the "fast handles" is when that tik tok kid only shoots half court shots..
Yo yall gotta get that dude off the mic. Dont nobody wanna hear him talk. We wanna watch yall play
You and yr whole team clowns
Abe taking off ! 🤣
14:30 anyone else notice the score not change off that layup?? lolll
Ryan woulda smoked y’all if y’all wasn’t hacking but it is what it is
Oi that Gio yute has 0 basketball IQ for real
And Chris calls bs calls when he misses
I don tlike your teeeam they jsut trash talking i dont see that in game trash shit
Bro dis might get demonetized cuz damn Cam was r*pin nick on these games
Carlos and the Arab get hard carried lol
The blond one has literally no basketball concepts.. Afwul to watch those shots.
Gio wtf was all that……….that’s all imma say…….Gio
why do y’all even run with carlos and abraham 🤣 only reason the team can’t be taken serious
Bruh y’all need to replace Lincoln with cam or sub Carlos
I was getting second hand embarrassment of watching gio not so wise play lmaooo
Gio funny af bruh
Alto videazo pa
Carlos ant do shit the hole game but talking the most shit smh
Nick get ya team mates bro they keep yelling and cursing at everyone for no reason Carlos ain’t even drop no god dam points but he’s yelling Abraham was playing defense and hugging people at the same time y’all need a work out regiment if y’all don’t already have one lord
Cam wilder owns nick briz
Chris full of shit
Sup with 2hype rematch?
Bruh Nick is taking over Youtube.
Gio’s MO is dribble 25 times in the same 4 feet of space and then take a ridiculously ill advised shot.
IDC what anybody says, Chris is trash!
Lmao.  No lie 😂I would of slap the fuck outta Carlos by then if he went to my face lmao
Carlos be talking the whole game  and made no shots he look stupid in the whole video
Not Nick cheating the score in the second game 😂 that’s supposed to be 11-11 bro
Mxm they left my niggga Carlos out whole game
Bro imma be completely honest in this question. Is Carlos Ed? Bro says the dumbest shit with no idea of what he is saying out his mouth. 💀💀

Gio always looks like he’s shooting a full court shot lmao he does more damage than good- when is he going to learn lol
Gotta live Chris cooking up #BABYFOOD

16:01 LMAOOOOO WHAT A CALL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gio is such a bum he makes me mad with all the half court shots plus he never makes any just quit tryna be flashy u not even built like that 🤣🤣🤣

Ok i take it back mayne dude wit the beard putting up some shots this game I see you big dawg I gotta take my last comment back just for this game tho cause every other game you talk to much an don’t do shit haha but Carlos still trash af
I want to see them actually play a team like east coast or west coast think it’ll be a good one

This man abraham shot been busted for the last 8 videos bout damn time he made some
Carlos is such an L gio did not acknowledge him once😭
Bronny ain't gonna play against y'all hackin-ass, screamin, outa control people. I'm a fan but liked y'all more when u was the humble underdogs @the park
I swear is those two white boys were in Puerto Rico they would get smack in the face right there 😂 Yoo play ball stop talking shit
Gio is so ass it’s crazy
Nick goes left everytime
10:02 biggest flop I’ve ever seen nick do
Gio basketball iq is so low 😂😂
This is hilarious, I promise lmao..
Lol Carlos Funny man 🤣🤣🤣
9:35  All ball 😂😂
Abe been in the gym and nick u getting bitched by that cam nigga poster him bra
Bro this dude Carlos is so trash and this dude wit the beard bro 😂😂 this dude talks every single game and averages 0.6 points a freakin game 😂
Isn't ben simmons in faze too?
bro carlos assed out he ain even score nun and was talkin crazy
No one was marking that little bearded muppets and he’s saying ‘I’m like that’ ahhaha
Türkiye de yaşasaydınız şu ana kadar ölmüş olurdunuz. :)
lol gio said this my shit after he’s like 1/8😭
I cant stand Carlos haha.
Carlos cut it out, u the weak link
Anytime I watch these videos I really love seeing Chris kill it!!!
9:55 was crazy
Big crash dummy gang!
Abraham went crazy
nick: ı m little be calm  carlos: this is the jungle the cages boy !
Cam is nice and humble.Nick fouled tht man every possession nd I like how he didn't call anything.tough.nd Hot Damn Gio went 2/20 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
big guy need to be humbled
Replace Carlos with cam
Chauncey the best one on the squad he’s nasty 🏀
Mannn 😂😂😂 CARLOS IS TERRIBLE
Carlos can’t talk shit at all. He’s complete trash. It’s time to let go Carlos and that Arab guy. They don’t do much lol. Get the other 2 guys from the other team. They can actually make their shots
Why I thought bra was wearing a mask in all these videos , that’s his beard ?!?!!😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gio was just selling
CARLOS WAS OUT THERE GETTIN KILLED BY HAPPY FEET !!! LMAO
See here’s my problem with y’all’s vids. Carlos talkin crazy all video talking smack to gio, other heads, but he didn’t get a bucket in this whole 20 min vid. Y’all call tic tac fouls but when y’all foul the other team y’all yell and don’t let them get it. Just unfortunate. Glad there’s not od fighting like a couple vids ago but cmon yall
Gio sold the game with them stupid ass shots
Nick was hacking Carlos weak as fuck and Abraham finally showed up
Chauncey always talking tht tough shit, somebody gone flatline his ass one day
The tic tockers just gotta work on defense and getting buckets inside..  Yall bois were getting layups everytime yall gave em a move
Aye its Ryanthecrashdummy
Carlos is a walking meme
Bro cam has fuckin limitless range and difficult shots HOF
Every time cam Wilder makes a move on Nick Breeze he pushes cam out with both hands it's a foul every time Nick Breeze does not know how to body a player he only knows how to foul the driver
Carlos talk a lot of shit for somebody that doesn’t really produce any kind of numbers in his defense is pretty shitty to I’d probably like to go if he wasn’t so damn cocky and run his mouth and start shit so much if his game was as tight as shit starting he’d be the next fucking Michael Jordan LeBron James as of right now not so much
Chris bodies smaller dudes on offense and calls tic tac fouls but gets bullied and complains about being stiff armed. What happened baby food?
Plz drop gio he was selling he went like 2 for 20.
Iman got 🔥🥵🔥🥵🔥... first time ever? Dude plays solid D. Always thought he should shoot more than Carlos. He has good shooting form.
Yo bro can u answer my thing plz it’s just that like Carlos shouldn’t be talking to gio like that he did nothing if he talked trash I’m sorry but I love yall
chauncey proved who’s the best
Savage squad fouling like fuck lol
Islam I mean Iman and Carlos are ass lmao 🤣 these dudes are left wide open hit 1 a game and act all hard lmao 🤣 Chaunc the only good one , nick is alright and Chris for being that big is mediocre
King Nick ‼️‼️
Carlos is so shit 😂😂😂😂😂
Cam be cookin savage squad
Hope the "Savage Squad" review the footage before uploading. All they do is hack/man was hugging the other player callin all ball and Big fella literally slapped his arm on the follow through. Understand keeping the acting skills up but jeez they sook a lot.
When ever Chauncey wears them green shorts he gets to COOKIN
Carlos pisses me off🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
How y’all be letting Carlos talk to y’all like that😂😂
Bruh  Abraham avg at least 2.1 points in a video and I swear he talks the most shit like he putting in work lmao
Does good know he doesn’t have to shoot that far back
I wanna know how Abraham and Carlos still have contracts 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Chauncey different😈
Poor Carlos hahahaha,I no need to say no more
Man what was going on with my boy jdub
Gio playing style pisses me off can’t play with that fool
i want the 1s wit abraham lincoln bro is trash
how yall lost savage squad are sorry bruh this has to be fake dawg 😂😂
Chauncey and Chris soft as hell. Lol
Oh $hit I seen Mr. "Beast" before on this court. Here's his bio: From Chicago (like 30 yrs ago?), all mouth, fouls a lot bc his feet 2 slow 🦥, very very limited hoop skillz
😭Carlos and the dude with the beard barely even score, it’s really nick, Chris, and chatsey or however you spell his name. Cam was getting buckets on you nick, and ya boy with the Kobe’s on was getting buckets, and the other dude was as well. It was a good game.
“On yo momma”  Aye that’s disrespectful 💀💀
Yo wtf it's wrong whit Gio Wise and his parkinson style? Is he a fan of Happy Feet or what?
Y’all take Carlos serious? Lol
Abe lincoln is trash 😭😭😭 straight fouling , talking about all ball . He's garbage 😭😭
Chris Energy real different when somebody taller than him 😂😂 can’t wait to play these goofys 😭😭 good video though 🤙🏿
Nick don’t come to memphis wts
What happen to the 2hype rematch
good game for iman 3&d and some huggin
Savage foul squad
Nick you can’t guard with fouling! Carlos is a fucking joke!
why yall hype up carlos for no reason lol mans is so baddddddd
Wheres the 2hype rematch yo
Carlos is so ass ong mans is talking all that and didn’t score once 😂😂😂
Yall need to drop Abraham hes cheeks
CAM WAS COOKING NICK YOU CANT EVEN LIE
Please play your five against Dfriga 5. Pretty sure you're not ready for that....ill give you credit you are a smart business man.
Imagine how lit they team would be if it was Chris, Nick, Chauncey, Cam, and Slim. The YouTube Showtime 😤🔥🔥🔥
Gio Is Assss! All That Dribbling For What To Airball Damn😭😭😭
Chauncey got his shot back...Thank God, he was cold 🥶 for like 2 months
wow chauncy got stripped grabed the shirt snd got  ankle breaker+cheap foul by carlos and1 really tough play nice!!
Why nick so calm this vid 😂
Carlos talking smack and scored 0 points in two games and the dude he was defending was humilliating him haha you have to love it
that lightskin dude with blue and green shoes was giving nick buckets 😂
Cam was carrying and gio was just dribble dribble dribble miss ! Selling
carlos can’t just be yelling his stank ass breath in people’s faces. he’s gonna try the wrong person one day.
@9:54 that’s a kobe shot right there.
Nick  is cams son at this point
Bro Carlos and Abraham sorry asf talkin all that while averaging a 10% FG and fouling every single defensive play every game 🤣💀 They the cats who don’t even make Freshman team cuts lol
Gio don’t understand how good he could be if he built his game around his handles, let’s be real he can handle the ball pretty well but he literally just dribbles and shoots, if he got some IQ and a few counters he’s be pretty decent and of course fix that broken shot lmao
The day Carlos gets hands put on him 😭😭
“I’m like that” 😂 no tf you’re not 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 you ain’t even better than carlos
CHILL OUT CHILL OUT CHILL OUT  Amazing shot G omm
Carlos acting so tuff but when chancey cussed him out he was quiet like a little bitch 😂😂😂
Wheres the 2hype?
Chris is actually legit good
if that dude a pond fish Carlos is a whole piranha in the face
Bro the way Carlos teammates talk to him it’s like they don’t even respect him, smh 💩 crazy
Bro he said 600k is the rematch now 700, what’s next 1 mil
Drop Carlos for cam
Tik tok got 2 good hoopers it cam and ryanthecrashdummy
Abraham came in clutch💯🔥
Where’s the 2hype 5v5 at 👀
I want to see a 1 on 1 between Gio and Carlos to see who is the biggest trash bag... winner plays Abe Lincoln
Man that arab a clown fr hahaha
You are good nick.
Geo wise is trasshhhh !!!! That man be dribbling n going nowhere 😭😭😭 shooting half court shots like he like that missing everything 😭😭
Drop abe for Cam 💀
dude cam is out here serving buckets
Chauncey need to run with a new team. The rest of the team Crackheads lmao
Chris talkin about people fouling him but he leads with his forearm everytime he goes to the basket. (Not legal)
I knew it was gonna be good when i seen cam
Carlos's d has improved so much. It's like he's actually learned how to slide his feet
All that trash talking y’all do is only allowed in the suburbs can’t go to the hood with that want end to good.
I would be mad if gio was on my team. What he keep shooting all them deep 3s for
Come to Polk, orange, or duval county
Yo sub to the channel. We need to see this faze match
Chauncey just a real as nigga too. People jaw him up but never want the smoke.
😭😭😂😂😂😂😂 Chris that was not a foul at the end stfu get out of here
I’m in school right now
If it wasn't for Gio just throwing up wild shots cam and them would've won every time.
Why is beard guy talking if he can't shoot
I'm sorry though, but that fadeaway 30 footer from cam was brazy. Savage squad built different though. They should put Cash an Kenny Chao on this team though, omm.
Gio trash asf he was 2-9 shooting far ass shots like the hell
Gio the most annoying player I ever watched😭
Nick when u gonna call out ball is life?
Gio is so aggravating bro like stop
I be having second hand embarrassment for carlos bruh but at the same time…i just..i gotta sleep him if he in my face like that and he aint do shit all game🥺
To sum up the video, Carlos and Abe are still dogshit and talk way to much, Chauncey is solid , Chris is just bigger than anyone. and Cam is the best hooper on the internet.
Bro Chris In these last couple vids splashing on god
All Carlos do is talk and don’t even be scoring 😭 do better Carlos pls stay talking trash abt ppl and your bad yourself
Somebody need to humble Carlos 💀💯
Gio smh got that same size up package
when you think Carlos is the worst on the court, they got him guarding someone worse than him.
Nick got cooked that both games
The big dude who say baby food I will feed him the ball all day in the paint so many points
One of the best videos
Carlos is toxic asf lol
People act like Nick’s 5 ain’t really 3
Cam shat on Nick 3 Times!! CLASSIC GIO ALWAYS SELLING AT THE END OF THE GAME
Carlos so ass 😭
Abraham has gotta go cuz he so inconsistent and annoying
Imagine Ben Simmons and Bronny lol
Carlos is so bad and he talk the most he had 0 points 😂😂😂
I woulda been like bro stop fucking shooting from halfcourt you not making shit
Cam cold as hell
Y’all can’t lie gio was selling their team the shots he was taking were not it
Nick …..let me get a spot on your squad!!!! I’ll earn it…..1 v 1 Carlos Fashooooo
Your boys gonna get seriously hurt out there threatening to break peoples jaw.
the worst on the team are legitimately the loudest and most obnoxious 😭
carlos miss all ball xD he Talk xD
Imagine Me vs. Nick, Nick Guarding Nick, one is playmaking sharp, and other  one is a pure sharp

Get a left hand Nick!!!

Cam and Gio on the same team 😨😨
Come to Philly and let Carlos or Chris call somebody a bitch or pussy they gon get smacked off rip … like niggas know better then to go somewhere that’s actually like that
Carlos is the flavor flav of this team... #BestHypeManEver
Is it just me or do they go to places where they know they can get away wit talking shit
Cam better than everyone on friga team no kizzy
Cam is better than nick ong point blank fucking period
You all seriously got to drop Carlos. Dude is straight ass
Can't stand TikTok Gio. He's good at shooting from 30 ft bc if he shot near a defender it's blocked every time! He shoots from his waist like a 3 grader.
How Carlos talkin when he got cooked by gio wise😂😂
Man Cam Wilder has a killer jumper with that height too
THERE IS NO FOULS IN STREET BALL
Chauncey and Chris carrying bruhhh 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
22-0!? Come to Brockton/Boston Massachusetts
8:20 that ain’t a foul  8:28 he double dribbles like twice Why is nick briz yelling for yea I understand it’s basketball and that’s a way of encouragement but he acts like a leader when he really ain’t that good
Stop putting click bait titles up "they wanted to fight" every other episode..

Aww he making excuses, if you wasn't giving excuses why mention it?
Dope game Savage Squad for the win but yall need get the Chemistry up
Dude in the orange headband talked madddd shit yet did NOTHING in 2 games... that's embarrassing.
Cam is more glitchy than cyberpunk when it first came out
I’ve been telling this niggas to come to the fort Myers area and they still haven’t showed up
Chauncey nice but I do agree with dude who was guarding him, in the beginning of the game Chauncey needed hella screens to get open
Literally 3 people score points for them. The 2 that do absolutely nothing talk the most. I can’t wait till someone sleeps them lol
Nick that first floater was trash 🤣🤣
goldfish pondfish? physique or physical attributes? it's spin the wheel on carlos per usual- he's had it lool
nick and carlos talking the most but doing the least lol
nick soft af
That skinny blonde dude thinks he Stephen Curry. Lol
CAM will never play for his shit team  ,cause is way much better than everybody and he definitely don’t like Nick… He humiliates him everywhere,anywhere
I never seen dude with the red bandana ball like that before
Nick was calm ngl
chauncey is like dat
Bruh ypk.raye not there 😂
Dem step back tick tok 3s was nasty.... . Gio extra dribbling ahh needa to practice how to shoot he trash asf 😂😂😂😂.. Carlos..... Just carlos 💆🏽
Cam is really like that💯💯
Gio wise low key ass
Broo Carlos talks his shit when he’s shit does nothin for the team he’s a joke

Drop Carlos for Cam Lmaoo! Just make Carlos a 6th man
Carloss 0
Watch every game y’all boys skraight entertainment
I'm excited for this match up against faze, keep up the good work
Who tf keep letting the Gio kid on these courts? Nigga need some fundamentals
Carlos is a clown for real he trash also he shoots “I pray to God shots”
can y’all play ball is life
The togetherness of the Savage Squad is on another level... And the trashtalk is a BIG BIG BIG factor in their game... Big ups!!
Wanna play against faze and win bro get rid of Carlos and that short beard dude they trash and get the dude with the different coloured shoes on the team only way you’ll win, the whole team can’t depend on Chris and Chauncey and you all the time bruh come on
Carlos the type of guy like when there is a function and someone says he's coming everyone gets mad like " fuck who invited him so annoying no one wants a 20 year old goof child
Chris makes an open shot Chris:”Fuck is they talking about. We out here killing shit”  Like stfu bro 😂
Bro if that asian kid was on my team doing that shit, i would literally walk off the court lol
No lie y’all have respect cam wilder now and not going to lie gio Was bussin calos ass
You need that dude with the two different shoes on your team hes clutch af!!!!
Everyone but chauncey and Chris gotta go that short dude wit the beard gotta go he can’t shoot for shit and Carlos is a flook machine who talks more shit than making plays or shots they both have got to go they trash replace em nick!!!!
Noooooo he didn’t threaten to break his jaw and put it on the other dudes momma😂😂😂😂😂
Gio gotta stop wit the curry range man he’s not that guy
If geo wasn’t throwing up dumb shit they would’ve had a chance
Gio got the basketball IQ of a turnip man, so frustrating
Bro nick be holding the crap outta cam bro. Ik bro was mad
effin minnie mouse lmao
Gio is an even worse shooter than Carlos
Gio is deadass probably the worst basketball player i have seen in my life,  dude is spamming dribbles when nobody is guarding him it's sad and embarrassing i think dude is slow
gio had a dumb as fuck shot everytime he touched the ball. thats so bad it counts as a turn over. take him out sub a guy in ... i mean almost anyone else at the park. and this is a diffrent game lolololol
Dude with the white shorts an different shoes he really is nice this the second video of him getting busy s/o to dude
cam did you dirty and you running down the court trynna get easy points 😭
Savage amounts of fouls
gio wise be selling the fking game breh. Stop taking so many dam shots
Didn’t this game get exposed for being scripted?
Tik Tokers got shooters fr but no defense Savage Squad really a tough team to beat cos Nick always got his thing going and Chauncey nice ah, Chris a fucking legend but when Carlos or Abraham Lincoln get hot while shooting it's a wrap
Carlos so fucking bad lol
Y’all will see me soon.
Carlos is so bad lol talks so much
“savage squad” lame asf, all they do is disrespect people, and then get mad when they stand up for they self
Who’s the guy with dreads on Tik tok squad
It’s never a video until you hear Nick screaming someone’s name for the ball. 😂
I only watch Nick and his crew cause they fight. Which is exciting lol. BESIDES THAT THEY SUCK lol! The ppl they play, play no defense. So of course nicks team will score.
If zero pulled up with cam and somebody else it would be another story
That asian kid was there carlos all he could do was shoot and dribble in the same spot
I don’t know who it is but he kept calling all ball even though he was literally hugging him every single time
Carlos is shit, why do they even let him play?
I’d rather have honest Abe than gio
Carlos is so bad, just big mouth!!!
Stay lit
No hating shii this niggas not good
What happened too the 2hype rematch
15:20
Lol  Mexican dude wit beard get 1 shot a game nigga  just be running around
Bro Abraham shouldn’t be talkin this man averages 50 words of trash talk a game he never score 🤣🤣
Bro Gio sold he literally only did step back half court shots like my man why you stepping back from half court 🤦‍♂️
Lol bro why tf do wit perm keep shooting from deep deep
Nicks trash and Chris ain’t about it when’s a real one come, he talk big to kids 😂😂😂
Gio just prays and sprays !! 😂 he don’t even have a shot whatsoever!! Just throws the ball everyyy time ! 🤔
13:00
Chris and Carlos both sorry as fuck... Chris way to big and talk way to much shit to be calling foul n the paint... Stop being a bitch and play ball... Carlos just mouf and that's IT NOTHING else....
Nick I be picking up cam if I was you man . He game is nice 👍🏼
Last shot, game on the line, curry range, who you picking - Carlos or gio wise?
11:37
Clown hair just chucks up shots, he thinks he steph curry and julian newman the worst of both worlds
Hate when people dribble and go no where with the ball literally geo lol what are you doing
what nick calls defense, is a foul 10 out of 10 times
why would bronny james play the savage squad
Does Nick know Carlos from before the YT shit? If not, replace him on the court hahaha Keep him around for the entertainment factor on these videos. But he's just not very good at hooping fr. Get light skinned buddy to run with yall. Lights out
Bruh why Carlos talking bruh 😂😂. But I love theses videos bruh.
10:30
Damn Honest Abe went off
9:47
17:00. That nigga cam airball, talkn bout he aint gon airball like that. He hit your arm way after the realease
Dude with diff shoes be hitting them 3s though
14-10 game 2. Big fan of the squad but thats foul u can't have arm on both side of a dude regardless if u get ball hugging thats a reach.
After the big guy scored then Cam hit the 2, score should’ve been 11-11 but they didn’t count the big guy’s point and kept it at 11-8. Should’ve been 11-9 then 11-11. Even Chris said it when Chauncey made 14. He said “4-1” which is 14-11 in streetball
Ngl cam def got my respect
How many lay ups were missed? It was like a Cam high light video. And are you honestly on a 22 game hot streak? Even friga, slim reaper and tjass will show their losses. The difference is, when y’all get down, you start calling horse shit fouls. The same fouls you do 💯 times worse to your opponents. Still entertaining. And Carlos is still garbage, but Im gonna keep watchin
Who told Gio Wise to shoot those dumb ass shots?
Gio shot like 0/3652,  that boi strugglin
Yo gio and cam this game ..............BUT THAT MAN CAMMMMM IS A DEMONNNN THAT 1V1 GOIN LOOK CRAZYYYYY
he air balled @16:55
Carlos is sorry asf he need to stop talking🤣
If I see that lil boi Gio in another video I’m not watching it...I was literally getting embarrassed by watching this. He went 3/20 and tried to say “this is my sh*t” after his 3rd make 😭
didnt see any tik tokers wanting to fight at all
Chauncey, bro. Make a channel please. We'd definitely watch your videos. Buddy with two color shoes on the opposite team has some true G. We've seen him hoop on one or 2 of these videos before and he's good ash.
Abraham is shit why do you keep bringing him
Nick was fouling all game
The short dude lookin like karate kid must be y’all DD or something cause ain’t no reason he should be on the court🥸
Cam is a baller for real for real 🔥 🔥
😂😂🔥
I ain't never seen gio make that many shots before.... ( went 4/18 )
I dont even know the bearded dudes name hut he normally scores like 1 2 pointer every 2/3 videos and when he does goes ape shittt lol. Today he hit his quota for nicks next 3/4 vids
Carlos and gio are equally trash… argue with me
good game tho
That man said he'll break your jaw on your mamma. Boy how yall let people talk reckless like that. I can't relate.
Chauncey and Abe finally actually playing decent lmao
Whoever Abe Lincoln guarding need to get all 15 points or whatever they playing to lol
Man bring y’all sorry ass to Greenville Nc  Y’all don’t play nbdy
Come to my city my team vs y’all wack ass
Cris and Carlos need to get humbled
So we’re gonna ignore how bad Nick traveled at 7:49 wtf
Carlos is wild pussy lol he makes us New Yorkers look bad Chris bullies till he gets big manned “he stiff armed me”  And Abraham Lincoln is the absolute worst  Chauncey always keeps it funky 💪🏽💪🏽
Jesus loves you ❤️
Carlos, YOU NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO TALK TO ANYONE ABOUT BASKETBALL, YOU ARE BAD.
Game 1 was actually game 2 and vice versa lol
How does it always get this hype??
Nick is garbage. Gio needs to stop trying to be like Steph.
When you shoot jumpers it looks like your about to level out with the ground and fall flat on your face
gio wise costed them so many turnovers
Chauncey is better than all yall
Abraham had more points than Carlos 😭😭😭
Another dope ass vid. Still seein some haters in the comments which make no sense cuz they still takin the time To watch the vid and comment 😂 but Shi if Cam was to play wit the team that would be a massive ass upgrade can’t lie. Overall it was a good game… bunch of dope players… then there’s Carl- I mean… what?
Carlos is the last person to talk about anyone shot😂😂😂😂
Gio is pure ass
Carlos talks so much shit to be that ass. He’s pure entertainment but it’s embarrassing
gio be crazy
carlos ain’t get dat rock passed to him damn near the whole video 😂😂
you know Nick was cool with Cam, he wasn't talking crazy like other videos
At this point you guys are just straight up disrispectfull i swear. You even yell at each other all the time, what a chemistry.
Is Carlos saying nigga bc if he's racist
Stop hacking
People who talk the most do less.
carlos had 0 points
Some people really hating on Nick like he cares 💀
They got RYAN THE CRASH DUMMY
Carlos, YOU ARE TERRIBLE AT BASKETBALL.
Who all played on the TikTok team
man why y’all cheating them boys? y’all had 11-8 when they scored on ryan lay and cams 2. it should’ve been 11 up
I love the fact iman’s new name really is Abraham now
Play a game without Chris nick you don’t do anything for your team I hope u get butt hurt as hell and learn how to play ball
This ain’t basketball lol
I thought my boy j dubs would have done better.
This is hysterical lmao. So messy so much disrespect so many 40 foot Gio bricks
Abe was fouling the heck out of ole boy in the black shirt and orange shoes.. homie was still putting in work though with all that fouling
Cam is a walking bucket
I'll give it to Iman he did really well he proved me wrony👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 But fucking Morty(Carlos)🤣🤣🤣🤣 that guy is just pure ass he can't do shit I was literally hoping he'd show out but he made himself a fucking circus clown..... Gio tho he was shooting too much he should've passed more instead but then great game even tho yall were hacking.
Not even real Basketball bunch of dumb only real hooper is Chris
Y'all need to recruit dude with the fro
carlos annoying AF
J Dub do something bro
Gio straight assss. Bricks for days.
Besides Chauncey Nick's whole team is utterly unlikable. But entertaining af lol
Stop talk, none of you can bang
Can’t wait till someone knocks out carlos
Cam and Chauncey were the only ones hoopin😂the rest are bummed out
15:01 Gio uses a good move to actually get space😳
Did carols even score ? talkin all tha shii🤦🏾‍♂️
Can y’all replace Carlos now? 😂😂😂
Chris needs his brand BABY FOOD !!!
Wtf was the Asian guy doing, that shi was pissing me off
I’m surprised Abraham Lincoln made sum🤣🤣
Gio out here looking like kurkos basketball 😂 playing agents miracles of generation
Gotttta run with cam dude for the one time
Abraham finally got some buckets, but get dude off the team fr
This was a Chauncey and cam wilder show they where ballin out!!!
Carlos about to get bench for Cam 😂
Faze clan is wack lol can’t wait to see y’all bury them
10:30-10:40 Bro’s kinda cold for that stripped them and gave them a tough bucket on Chauncey too, I didn’t expect that🔥🔥
Time to replace Carlos the man is straight garbage no defense or offense 🤦🏽‍♂️
Gio shoots 100 3 pointers makes me ( yahh whats upp now!!!) smh
LMFAOOO SAVAGE SQUAD GOT FRIED😂😂🚫🧢
9:50 sorry nick but he's over you 15:18 F**k up the system, make it shutdown
pls god, get rid of carlos man i cant watch this shit anymore
Y’all always complain about getting fouled when that’s all y’all do.
GIO ALSO SOLD WHAT A TERRIBLE PERSON TO HOOP WITH LMAO
Carlos said I’m an ape, please tell me what he did
need dat yrg reaction
Wtf Carlos didn't even score and he talking shit
Nick was holding Cam on every drive and grabbing smh.
Baby food
You should take on Ballislife west squad. If you tried the intimidation and smack talking you do against these soft pussies you play they would not back down and could match your intensity.
Cam showed the difference between YouTube guard and actual hooper lol nick had no 3 point game just all leaning layups.
This white dude thinks he’s tough and thinks he’s hood Lmaoo I can’t wait to witness him get checked.
Savage Squad calls sooo many fouls for a squad who hacks every possession themselves lmao
I would love to run against y’all 5 would be a great one
#HOOLIEEESSSS🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One point left and you do that.....😂
lol these kids foul on every defensive possession the only thing interesting is is the shit talking
The dude Carlos guarding try to play like a cheesy ass 2k park player 😭
Is the dude with the yellow hair  allergic to the paint or midrange?
Carlos would be a great commentator!
Carlos literally didn’t score
Crist is literally  unguardable. Carlos is a joke. He talk big and score 000000 😂😂😂
Gio doing all that squeakidy squack squack shit. But the ball never really goes anywhere.  Kid thinks he's the professor
Dude with the white tank top sold bad
The fast dribbling orange hair kid is terrible. All that dribbling and never go past your defender is pointless🤦🏾 then he got Carlos guarding him and making him take 40 shots
I’ve never seen someone talk so much shit and have no impact on the outcome of the game, score would not have changed if Carlos didn’t play lol
Who the hell did the dude dribbling the ball real fast and chucking it up think he is? Some religious person I guess since he kept throwing up prayers.
Bro these tik tik wack af all they can do is shoot half court shots they have zero talent
Wtf was Julian Newman’s ugly brother doing?? That shit belongs on tik tok not the court
All these dudes lame. Tiktok dudes just hoopin and getting fouled the whole time, smh
14:30 they didn’t count the basket??
PAASS THE BALL TO CARLOS LOVE THE VID
We all know Chauncey fought that dude after the game
yo nick u got to get yo get back fr fr cam was doing dirty☠️
“Yrg in the building”😭
bully's, your mom should be proud
Wats worse karlos’ trash talkin or abrahams shooting?
Dude scored one time in like 20 other videos and finally hit some WIDE open 3’s in a video and now he’s like that 😂😂😂
GIO is TRASH!!! shooting all those balls PAUSEEE!! get him out of here.
Patrick Mccaw played well
14:39 chris aka fat boy complaining that he was stiff armed, bruh that's your go to move.
ok, dont trade the little one
Cam is fireeeee
Watching Carlos play the sport of basketball makes me never want to play again
Gio really getting me mad. Once the dude makes a lucky deep 3 he all of a sudden thinks he can’t miss from anywhere.
Ballislife squad east or west vs savage squad
Why are all videos clickbaited by fights now. Make it about basketball again.
Abraham getting better… doesn’t want to be left off the squad again 👀 gotta respect it
Video quality is very bad. Good game though
10:00 nick in his feelings💀
The blond Asian is the worst player on the court😂😂😂 he thinks he’s so good and the man literally doesn’t even know how to shoot a basketball 😂
fuckin carlos he is only talkin
the guy is the mic is annoying
Lübnan James'den 2 üçlük mü :)))
Dude with Afro is best player there ong y’all bro YouTube or something
Carlos talking all that shit like he didn’t score 0 points in both games 😂
Yoooo why is Carlos dressed like a 40 year old white guy who is playing basketball at LA Fitness for the first time in 10 years?? 😂😂
These dudes had a wanna be Curry smh
I wish skip and Shannon would make a conversation about this 😂 it be worth to watch
The dude with the fake beard carried
imagine cam , nick , chauncey, chris , abe would smack. i woulda said carlos but yk
Abraham fighting for that contact today 😂😂
Carlos looks like mike wazowski on god
Gio wise is actually trash, like the dude just chucks up random shots, the way he shoots is wack af and whenever he dribbles he doesn’t actually seem to go anywhere. Julian Newman 2.0
These niggas know what parks to go to because if they go to the right park talking crazy like this; I don’t think there would be a video 🤷🏾‍♂️
When gio do finish that shit do be hard 🤷🏽‍♂️
Gio out here selling
Man Y’all Hand Check When Y’all Get Blown By 🤣 Can’t Believe This
bro honestly gio wise suck bro my granny could beat him she only got one arm bro
Nic looks shook.. dude embarrassed him.. carlos just talks shit, no game.
15:23 🔥💨
Is this scripted? And why do we never see a real fight?
Of course they put Gio Wise on Carlos, the worst defender on the team
Only reason i get beat up playing basketball is because i watch you guys too much. big fan :D shoutout from the Philippines
In reality nick is asss
Add cam drop ab lincon just a thought
YRG IN THE BUILDING YESSSIR
I’m not gon lie 😂 I’ve been tapped n for a min and ain’t peep I wasn’t subbed my fault nick! 💯
Why Chauncey acting like he could knock anybody out he like 150 pounds😂
What they really need to do Is replace Abraham with Cam then that is the squad
Bro they should have left gio on the side of the street the way he was playing
Carlos trash ha
Nick fouled the hella out of the guy he was guarding every possession
Gio suck in my opinion not only that he got cooked by carlos in carlos video😭😭😭😭😭😭😭all that unnecessary dribbling wen u losing😭😭
Imaging being an introvert and playing with these guys🗣️
Carlos running the fastbreak was the funny thing i seen on a basketball vid
Bro gio is soooo fucking TRASH all he do is dribble dribble dribble dribble dribble dribble dribble dribble I started dozing off..  then u jus dribbling in one spot at that.. bt overall good shit nick💯
the are not real hoopers, they only know to shout
Jesus love you all
*Your title of the video is a lie💩
Was Carlos even playing?
Dude nick out here acting like he’s being fouled and crying at 9:52 their antics get old they act like they don’t foul just about everytime and then call fouls when game is close and it’s not one point is they lame af
dat boy cam literally owns nick 😭
Where’s the 2hype rematch !??
no cap nick is a horrible teammate and team player he always yells and demands the ball … and always wanna start something him or the team tbh there dog shit
Carlos what a toxic man
"You look like a pond fish" lmao say what?
Cant lie Chauncey and Chris really the best in the team
Waiting for Jeremyx to make a video titled "this might never happen again" talking about how Abraham scored 6 points in a game.
Gio is the only player I’ve ever seen with the quickness of Allen Iverson and the shot and skill of someone with cerebral palsy 😂
Come to South Carolina. I’ll run y’all!!💪🏼
And in tiktok people think savage squad not good🤡
Carlos gonna get rocked one day so bad lol
Carlos looks like that fish from fish hook
Some of those 3s were cold as fuck
chancey got his mojo back, he been a little off the past few vids. nice to see him banging out the 3s again and playing on form.
When did they wanna fight lol??
🤣 they play the biggest scrubs and think they nice 🤣
Liked every vid
Bin Laden just here to make up the numbers
Yo Chris is getting pretty nice and Chauncey is getting nasty the squads getting good tbh
Its honestly just Chauncey with the help of Chris
Why tf carlos taking he got no points and went 0/2 for 3’s 😂😂
This man Abraham Lincoln said it all ball when he had his other hand rapped around the guy you could definitely tell that he doesn’t know how to play basketball
savage squad jut foul the whole time haha they like actually trash hoopers ahah
i love this channel , you can watch these opportunistic/aggressive) hunter gatherers in they natural habitat,  natural geographic  watch and learn how to make nature documents.
This dude Gio got handles but he NEEDS to work on that shooting accuracy 🤦🏻‍♂️💯
Nick kept fouling the shit out of Cam because he was cooking him lool
That lil lesbian can hit those 3s
Carlos had 0 😭
We wanted the brawl 💪
That Gio dude needs to stop playing basketball Fr
Nick sounds like Charlie Zelenoff when he’s talking about 22-0 😂😂😂
Drop Carlos he sucks
Get some new kobes bro
Chris: “he stiff arm me  Also Chris the whole game: *stiff arm* *body*  *hook shot*
carlos looks dumb asf tryna guard gio😂😂😂
the 2 players that did the least throughout both games did all the shit talking at the end 🤣🤣
Cam friga the one black guy cash and some other hooper that’s a savage sqaud pack
This is the first time seeing this and i thought it was basically basketball but this is pretty toxic way of playing there’s a difference between friendly trash talk and this . U got the guy in the red jersey somewhat good but couldn’t really get inside if he’s defended properly , guy in green shorts constantly telling people he’s going to break peoples jaws and knock them out? Btw never happened , u got this little kid full on basketball gear more than anyone else can’t play worth a damn and has a big mouth being 5 feet tall and great that he shaves his eyebrows like a woman, u got this giant doofus of a guy that can’t play at all just pushes his way in and runs around calling people soft and when he can’t score he constantly calls foul, and miniature Rambo was actually pretty good. On the other team the guy with the tied up fro? He was properly good actually and the skinny guy with the black shirt and orange shoes was great at layups but the rest of them are nonsense . Am I the only one that has this observation? All of this in front of a cheering crowd of high school kids some of the players look pretty old. Behaving like angry children that have pent up frustration this was pretty lame to be honest.  I’ll go back to watching professor he can calmly destroy people not with threats and screaming and insulting but quietly with his skills . U know what they say about the loudest one in the room . I don’t see this going anywhere besides leading to a major fight eventually I tend to avoid that but if that’s ur cup of tea I guess u all continue to do that but I thought basketball and ufc where two different things
12:45 Carlos a brick wall ☠️☠️
Nah Cam different bruh
Fuckin Carlos ☠️🤦🏻‍♂️😂
abe nastyyyyyyy he really look like he’s been putting work in the gym
Iman saw Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and said "that's the Abe I wanna be"! But don't scream "I'm like that" bro that was an anomaly, but I'm rooting for ya keep it up!
Blonde hair dude play like those speed boosting dudes in the park
Mad people sleep on cam he nice asf. But the video had good runs it would be nice to see cam play with savage squad on same teams
Carlos crazy in a bad way
“Tiktokers wanted to fight” seemed other way round😂
I like how Carlos talk the most shit and never do shit 😂😂😂
ik gio and cam teammates mad tired of stittin in the corner watchin them chuck halfcourt bricks and airballs💀
Chauncey let’s be real you not breaking nobody jaw 😂 I hate when mfs boost shit for the camera you not like that in real life you a good boy
Cam is a straight up assassin 🥶that boy nasty
At 14:28 it was supposed to be 11-9 didn’t he make that lay up on Chris ?
Ayy dude said Yrg yessssirrr
Chauncy is back man!!!!!
Nick got cooked by afro🤫
Bunch of goofballs. They hack and hug you on Defense but cry the loudest when they get bumped on Offense. 🤡 🤡 🤡
"Tighten up before I break your jaw... On your mamma" na Chauncey wild
2:15 into the video all I hear is y’all talking shit like damnnn play the game😂 and y’all wonder why mfs be beating y’all ass
GG’s🤝
This nigga cam is different different sheshhhhh 🐐🐐🐐🐐
That boy on the tic tok team that be dribbling in place and launching 3's ... do me  favor and never pick him up AGAIN.. HE ONE OF THE REASONS YALL LOST
what happened to 2hype
Jdubz custom is trash
Fuk is you talking bout
carlos gotta chill
Carlos talking so much shit, while being the worst player I ever saw
Cam is by far the best in every video he’s been in😳
goi needs to pass the ball
They lost all those games cause Of gio
Abraham need to chill. Always talking crazy but doing exactly nothin on the court. A game of trash talk but you atleast gotta do something before you start going that route
Shoutout to tribalism!
excuses are like assholes we all know you got one but why yours looking all beat up and tore back
all ball bro you can wrap half there body have your hand on the ball and call all ball learn the rules thats a foul not a block or steal
wacko tryin to be steph curry from near half court can take that trash out to the dumpster
9:58 nick you canNOT fucking guard cam
But that gave was fire
Carlos looked like a bum out there and he had a big doughnut 0
Nick carries too much
why is there a giant red ball on the side lines?
Nick can’t play defense without fouling
yall cry when you get fouled but every tie on defense you guys are getting burnt on your first step and fouling the guy right after literally every damn time yall need to stay planted or get burnt the way you play  wont fly on a legit court with refs this call your own foul bs is a cheaters game
i dont know why these boys get hype after making on shot and missing every other one lololol
U fauling all the time, learn how to D for real
When y’all’s rematch against 2hyoe
Carlos looked like he went to the Baby Gap to get that get up
Geo is trash
Liked these guys in the beginning, now they all ego especially nick, that guy got 5 threes dropped on his head bro and still reckons he's the best. videos almost cringeworthy
My boy Carlos was off and Abraham was on 😂 both of them can't be on at the same time 😂
Carlos Neato-Stat of the Night: 0 points 81 trashtalk
Chris is so athletic🤩🤩🤩🤩
14:32 they didn’t count his point to the score, it would’ve been 9 to 11.
Carlos really aint bout it broo🤣🤣
LMFAO Nick got destroyed this vid..Cam scored 3s in his face like 10 times...and Nick could barely score on him haha XD
Dream team whooped dat ass yet again.... nicely executed. Instead of balling they were or he was showboatining.... 22-0 is impressive... making lots em look foolish
nahhh Iman went crazy
Y’all are gonna hurt bronny I hope he doesn’t play against y’all 😂
Carlos literally talking about that jungle they’re out in(???). And Chris keeps saying “fuuuack YOU TALKIN’ BOUT’”. Kinda cringe ngl. Like the intensity But gawddamn playing against those people. My ears would explode☠️☠️☠️☠️  Nah I’m just joking. Ik talking BOUT THE JUNGLE! WE OUT HERE. NIGHA NIGHA. BUUUUUMMMMM ASSSSSSSS
Bro chirs be making the most excuses like bro you aint that cold
Gio really trash man . Idk y he so famous for bro just dribble like a maniac and goes nowhere
That boy Cam is just wild!!
When’s the 5v5 against 2hype again
18:03 what happened after this? Look at what's happening in the back..
Wtf your camera man was drunk or what??? Video was shaking all the way through.
I just like to troll
Yourrage gone love this one!!
This team needs a big man dunker for the showtime value.
2HYPE?
Tik tok mfs got no defense
Cam wilder the truth smh damm nick at least it ain’t friga
Carlos..two game.. zero points..just yappin
These guys make no sense says what he taking about but like bro man said nothing
2hype vs savage squad rematch 👀
Check ball ain’t no call
i know yall heard "YRG IN THE BULDIN" @ 4:27
All they do is foul
Nick and his squad gets so happy over easy ass stuff
At this point i think abe is just there to make the others look better
13:47 Chris burned Nick silently. 😂😂😂
bro at this point gio just selling throwing stuff up
9:49 Omg dat fade was nasty I almost 🥛
Carlos Try to roast someone without stuttering LOL.
💪🏼💪🏼
17:18 he was hugging him lol... & i love how the briz team just talks trash the whole time even when they know they are wrong. then they try to make you feel retarded if you call a legit foul so you won't call any fouls later even though they will.
jesus all this acting tough, playing prison defense but calling non existent fouls the other way is getting boring...chauncey is the only one of that team that's actually good at basketball and is not bitching
Nick got 2 crazy 3's in his face 2nd game but I aint hear no commentary on that from him
Carlos and Abe need a reality check all theyre defense is just hugging the offense and they cheeks asf
What happened with the 2hype rematch are they ducking?
Gio making shit
Carlos is weird
This shit is a joke lol. Every vid nick and his guys talk mad shit “ we didn’t want to fight” lol
Carlos is so unathletic
Cam hurts them bad 2 for 15 every game  never seen him go hole and why do you need to take half court shots that look like hailmarys
Come to hope well park madisonville kentucky, bet 10k on a game .
Carlos just retire your not even that good and really who misses a wide open lay-up like bruh.
Chris out there killin shit my guy is a Viking on the court
Savage squad  that’s my money team
Gio wise keeps on forcing a deep range 🤣
Nick...you need to restructure your shot.
You played great D and that dude just hit tough shots
Can't wait till Carlos gets smacked for talking to the wrong guy
wow he is terrible...you know who.
Every time nick makes a mistake he blames someone else 😂😂
Carlos skunked all vid but talked the loudest hahahaa
Y’all just toxic at this point mane 🤦🏻
CAM WILDER. SAVAGE SQUAD 🔥😤🔥
Abe needs to stfu
Carlos got flamedddd
man get off the basketball court shooting half court jumpers, you aren't steph curry.
Carlos stfu u aint score nothing the whole game but talking so much stuff lost respect, James Harden u gained some respect from those 3 3s but u dont be doing shit either tho but carlos u 🤢
SAVAGE Squad v. Friga squad, the youtube community needs that 💯💯
Nick briz can’t defend for shit !!! Without using his hands and holding on the waist he’s BBQ chicken
Abraham man… i dead ass say he’s ass in the comments every video. This time he locked dudes down and made his shots back to back! Wow
Wtf this little guy 17.15 clearly foul.
Bro gio has got the ugliest jump shot even though he makes shots
Just another video where Carlos does nothing but talk
Tiktokers: gone against Nick Briz's squad   Nick's whole squad: you not that guy pal, you not that guy
Bro these niggas nick and them cry about every foul but yet be fouling the whole damn time like smh 🤦🏻‍♂️ soft
“I ain’t just gonna airball like that” well camera ain’t lie
Carlos tried to clown bros shoes and Bro had on the Bright Mango Kobe’s $600-700 Carlos is a walking L
Ayo why u trying to vs faze and amp when they aren’t hoopers 😂🤦🏾
Ayo why u trying to vs faze and amp when they aren’t hoopers 😂🤦🏾
Dang Abraham really be like that in this vid tchyall
You should not let Carlos trash talk anyone... if he cant get buckets
Wtf blonde dude  dont watch stephen curry pls
The level of satisfaction I felt watching cam shit on nick was out of this world… can’t believe he didn’t try to fight him over it 😂
Nick hate to say it but you ain't better then bronny james
K showtime vs kris squad?
Plz come to bama bd try that savage sh*t cause I see a lot of hand checking 👀👀😆
Why Carlos says Irish Spring?
carlos talked the most and did the least
Carlos is trash so bad that he lives on Nicks garbage bin... every time they gonna play Nicks goes to the garbage disposal and bring Carlos out!
bruh im sorry but gio wise so ass he basically threw that game lmfaooo
I’m tryna see Chris get rocked lmao
How does carlos get on team he is a defensive liabilty
Nick explain 12:32 😳😳😳 Ayo????
We not going to talk about that point they didn't give cam team? Look at 14:30
Nick I rock wit you but I hate Carlos like I ain’t seen I video when he matters 🤦🏽‍♂️and yo big man just bigggg he ain’t played no one his size yet bro
Carlos is like a female trying to act hard lol l
Gio Wise is the most boring player. Yeah he has all that fancy fast feet dribbling but it isnt even that good all he does is shoot and miss deep 3's and when he hits one after air balling 4 in a row he thinks hes good
Dude sprayed nick so many times what y’all think friga gonna do
carlos is pissing me off bro, why is he even talking like that when he hasnt scored in like 12 videos LMFAO
Carlos is the trashes player but the one who talks the most lol
Bronny not playing against yah you niggas don’t play ball yah play football
nah fuck that play them ball is life niggas i gotta see that🤣
Naw cam different
Today was a good day, me levanto y hay vídeo de Nick, día perfecto...
Quit running from k showtime
it makes me upset watching gio play...
Every video title FIGHT... FIGHT.... FIGHT..... PUNCHED.... THEY WANTED TO FIGHT US   Every video   Chris - " Imma smack you, imma fuck you up, fuck you you wanna go, lets go then"  Carlos " This is the fucking jungle you wanna do something about it!"  Chauncey "Imma smack you in your face"   Other team - WTF just chill out lets play.   End of video Nick in a hoody "Yo you know we not about that life we just here to play ball and have fun"  😂😂😂😂😂😂
What about gio
why is carlos playiong basketball?
Bruh is no body going to talk about how the “savage” squad be cheating with the score 🤔
ive never seen carlos drive, and i know why now now
this the first time i’ve seen abraham make a shot
If they brought all that wanna be tough guy shit to atx they'd get knocked out on sight. All that trash talk on the court and no one does anything but talk... they don't do that in Texas
I saw this game already different channel but just realized that guy with the beard from nicks team sucks as bad as Carlos. Why tf is he on the team. At least carlos get fans for his un athletic skills.
Abe Lincoln fucking sucks! Dude does more talking than actually playing!
Carlos sucks so bad and dude talks the most !!
Gio Wise: unlimited range....
Carlos has no right to say anything after this game
Next video:  ‘Old lady crossing the road WANTED TO FIGHT’
If u gonna talk trash the whole game atleast score…be humble bout yo own game….im sure they waste alot of stored energy on screaming and arguing the only good ones is nick chris and chancey carlos need to retire i cant stand his ass bro he sorry n no help at all he want the ball dont wana hustle for it or ever ever take it to the rack
Nick and his teams still a bunch of clowns. Can’t even make it through the video. Someone get them their meds.
yall gotta give lil dude wit the braids more shots lmao he rly a shooter
Gio honestly sold all game. He had carlos who’s obviously the worst player on defense and he dribbles in one place instead of blowing by him
Against FaZe? That’s gonna be fun asf
That dude Chauncey is like that
Bro why is Carlos still on your squad? He’s trash
Cheated the score 14:31.. bro made the shot and the score stayed at 8 when it should've been 9.💁‍♂️
Nick get rid of Carlos garbage ass and out cam on the team nobody beating that Carlos don’t do Shit
pull up to NY nick your team sucks ass we'll cook your whole team
GET NICK BRIZ TO A MILLY ALREADY
today was Abraham’s game
Waiting for a video that doesn’t include “wanted to fight” in the title.
Fuck yea , NIck Briz vid today yoooo
I’d I had Gio on my team I’d just go home
Respect to Nick for keeping it cool during the whole video!! And also for giving respect to the other team 💯
Cam Wilder really did his thing man he’s a bucket for sure team up with him for a couple park runs 💪🏾💯
God is good
You guys got bullied in school didn’t you
Someone gonna smack carlos with a beer can next😂😂
What happened with the 2hype rematch at 600 k?
cam owns nick
i’d love to hoop with yall im a real hooper ‼️
Damn Abraham Lincoln walked off my 5 dollar bill to drop buckets on em today
Lebanon James is balling
i cant stand nick whole team only one i have respect for is chauncy i most def cant stand carlos he talk the most shit and complete ass the worst on the entire team
Carlos and other dude with headband and no shirt is ass hands down the only ballers on your team is you (Nick) sometimes lol and big dude (sometimes)
11:56 ???
It’s a Dam Shame College and So Called Professional B Ball isn’t this exciting and coordinated. You team is so in tune with each other. The other team for a change was up to your level as well, just not as coordinated - and a little too much show boating. But they are good..
Im a relatively new viewer and i feel like Carlos needs to get his Ass whooped once or twice without having the safety of his friends this guy is waaaaaaaayyy to cocky for his skill level
I have to give respect to cam he can play a lot better than I thought he could 💯
Lmk when y’all wanna set Las Vegas up. Y’all won’t win a game I promise
Y’all are so buns omg that shi so terrible
Why Everytime nick complains he sounds like he bout to cry😅😅
i would play carlos for 1,000
there goes my man busting up nick's ass. afro. nick = throw shot. in our out. ben simmons real life lol . aren't u ashamed ? they are not even guarding you when you're taking a shot in perimeter most of all 3 point line ? 😂😂😂 chris has more 3 point made than you in every game you posted.
“Im like that” 😂😂😂boy you like 3 for 60😭
Y’all so trash bring that shi to Vegas , west coast shi…🥱 @nick briz
Yo I need to see Cam on the Savage Squad that man can absolutely HOOP
Gio play just like that annoyin ass guard’s on 2k that just dribbles and shoot any and everything no matter how many times he miss 🤣also that boy Abraham out there hugging everybody sayin all ball😭
@9:55 tough ass bucket by Cam stop playing with em 💯💯💯🔥
Yuuuh YRG in the building 💯💯
What happened to 2hype rematch?
GIO Wise a whole bitch for selling the whole game
It’s really 4v4 with Carlos and Gio in the match. Carlos really sucks. I’m not even sure he could beat me and I don’t even play basketball.
just finished watching this. prolly one  of the best ones.cam vs nic was fire , abraham lincoln actually hitting buckets but he hacking and hugging, carlos vs gio was hilarious 😂,someone actually talkin shit to chris, chauncey still getting buckets, and an almost fight lol  cam in savage squad would be OD 🔥
10:30 hehe
It’s “jhit” nick not “JiT”
Carlos scored how many?
So much crying and fouling getting hard to watch
Dudes that show up to the park to with their speaker and mic to “announce” make everything worse. Good vid tho
Fire vids
Carlos bodied that nigga. when he got the ball. Had me dead 💀🤣.
How is Carlos talking when he’s getting cooked by Gio man 😂😂😂 I know Gio shot hella bad shots and airballed most of them but he really went past Carlos every time Carlos couldn’t even do anything about it
15:23 Cam wilder > salvaged squats
Gio gotta have a contract with nick to help his team lose😂😂
He named it “they tryed to fight us”  but they was the ones trying to fight. I don’t get it
This is my favorite yt channel rn for sure
That blonde kid is a joke
Y'all should run a 5v5 against BallisLife
Shit show honestly
Carlos too hype for somebody who didn’t score
Abe balled out
Wtf is gio doin man he really sucks yo that shit is crazy lol
Good competition for you Nick, everyone played good.
Sen bir Türkiye de böyle yapta seni düdüklesinler
Serious question. I watch a lot of videos but is there enough video of Abraham Lincoln over there doing anything to make a highlight film? 😂 i think i seen him only talking
If Bronny show up y’all best not talk that crazy stuff to him🤣🤣 Bron finna be on that
Even Abraham got a bucket 😳
"Were gonna have a match against faze and were gonna with the energy and have a good time"  Name one time Nick came to a game Without starting a whole war against randoms
the real question is why chris isn’t in the nba
Savage squad out here playing IRL 2K park with a 22-0 game winning streak 😂💀
Abraham Lincoln finally showed up lol
Lmao how gio better then abraham🤣
Don’t even get how this dude gets views like, he’s a complete joke him and his whole team.
Abraham is fouling lol he's built like an air force 1
11:40 Carlos is so fucking slow man 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gio be selling bro
First video I’ve seen where Abraham actually in the mix😂 boys been working on the low
Nick fr swallow your pride boot Carlos and get the tall guy from the other team lol dude dropped like 10 3's on you boys in two vids ha ha
Carlos u ain’t had shit the whole game
Chauncey lowkey a menace😂
“I’ll break yo jaw fr” “I know” 😭🤣🤣 odd ass exchange
DAFAWK
Why do Carlos is here ? On both match he didn’t have the level, the speed and the shoot accuracy. Even if you win and if I like the time you need someone else
HA HA CHRIS and Chauncey have to right to talk about push off's Half of chris drives involve extending an arm lol
bruh cam was making some craaazy shots damn
12:08 stop ittt🤦🏽‍♂️😂😂
Nick was carried
Carlos rlly trash
16:05 I forgot he makes vids
It’s always the wrong people on savage squad talkin smack then the supporting cast saving them
No shirt Abraham is different #intemidatorBadge
Love these videos most entertaining on YT rn by far and the views show keep this shit up 💯
gio is bad lol
Gio would’ve got slapped taking them dumbass shots when I’m trying to win
Pls Upload more Videos! ^^
Im still tryna figure out how carlos is still part of the squad. He's not good at all so im guessing he's just family
Chris is a BALLER
Ik cash gonna react to this and be mad at chancey for missing the ankle breaker😭😭
bro cam be doggggggin nick😂😂
Carlos is no longer funny, he sounds annoying AF
carlos, and headband dude suck
Where the comp at 😂
Bro Cam be wildin 😂😂
Everyone accept Chauncey and nick is goofy as shit rest of them make me cringe
It’s about time Abraham made a shot , good game & vid and tho 🔥💯
Still entertaining content but the savage squad has become so toxic .. Chauncey even like throwing up duel middle fingers in dudes face after scoring a bucket .. yikes
Abraham tripping balls the whole vid
i like how carlos been talking shit to gio gio scored and carlos had zero..
Same team took 3 L’s
Carlos had literally no room to talk in this game and basically every game he’s played😭😭😭😭
Gio sold that game. Bro was throwing up random ass shots. He made Carlos look good bruh and Carlos has gotta be the worst basketball player I’ve ever seen. He talks shit all game acting like he’s that guy. Carlos makes the videos unbearable.
Yall got little kids in the stands. I don't mess with this.
Y’all foul the whole time, then call a foul just BC you miss a shot. Play ballislife East squad or some real competition at least that will stand up for themselves. Y’all just out here cheating wins lol
What is this 😭🤦🏾‍♂️
Replace Abraham with Cam
And Chris to big to be calling fouls lmao when he foul even harder
"your ass your not scoring any points" - carlos as this nigga has no points in 2 games 😐
I'm just here for the Abe Lincoln comments.
if they replaced the abe lincoln dude with wilder they would be undefeated
abe forgets about the doubters and drops what like 4 threes 🤣
im 4 seconds in and I instantly hate Carlos.
Carlos a different kind of special.
Gio wise trying to get a highlight not winning the game
damn Nick, u got straight cooked the whole video 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Chauncey never folds lol it dont matter who it is
Dude said that was locks on 9:38 that’s a foul my guy u can’t wrap your arms around a player
am i also tripping or it feel weird not seeing nick in a white beater
Gio lost both games for his team one man offense vs team get this kid of the court just jacking up shots
Cam is who Gio Wise THINKS he is 😂😂😂
Carlos is ass omg
Y’all ball out Fr bro, love your content! Keep it up🤙🏼🏀💯
Ngl i hate watching people play defense wit there hands but it is what it is
And nigga out here hella bugging and fouling ofc yall aint getting beat
Love this Channel but Carlos need to stop talking trash , everyone else is a A-B player Carlos is a D to D-
Nick got to the oOooOoOOp 😂
bearded bro was hitting buckets that day lol
15:22 cam didn’t have to do nick like that
Nick was quiet in this video (not as far as scoring he did what he was supposed to facts) but I didn’t hear him doing his competitive talk he usually does I could tell something wasn’t all the way right but overall great fucking video this the cleanest one I’ve watched on your channel bro he definitely should bring cam on permanently! Chauncey did his thing as usual Chris .. you lol the vibes gangsta much love from Brooklyn/Queens NY FUCKISYOUTALKINBOUT !!
nick love all the hype and energy yall bring but yall gonna talk all that trash to the wrong ppl one day and they not gonna hesitate i swear great content tho
Y’all cheated them it was 11/9 when ol boy did lay up on Chris y’all kept it at 8
Chancy pressure 💯
idk but everytime i see nick shoot that swan lookin more and more dangerous
I’m waiting for the day someone just punches the crap out of Carlos
Mr Lincoln really said im built like that after making open shots.
Ngl but Carlos gotta really start putting in work and at least get confident to make a lay up . I support bro but if you gonna talk shut then at least have numbers on them boards man .   -Yeah I kinda referenced pusha
flamingo park legend
Just whatching the crazy kid that throws on half court makes me cringe so so bad
Bruh Gio got stop taking those shit shots from half court, he not like that
Headband Abraham Different 👀
yooo watching gio ball frustrates the sh*t out of me lol dude is such a ballhog and just shoots dumb
Only real fans kno there record isn’t 22-0😭
that blonde dude is literally pissing me off. What is he doing?!
Nah cam is niceeeee
Take the mic off if you go scream the whole time
That lil sloth dude need a mustache or something. His beard look so weird on his face 😂😂
where’s my 100
Gio so bookie 😭😭😭 he was 1-1000 thru those 2 games
Where the fuck is the 2Hype v Savage rematch?
5:25
That dude with the black shirt and different color shoes is nice with it no lie
That dude GIO is so bad. He is way to cocky to be that bad.
didn’t they say they were gonna play 2hype again at 600k? you still ain’t said nothing about that.
17:16 iman hugged the shit out of that boy and has the nerve to say all ball😩
aye ocky with the beard really pissing me off get him off the team with his fouling sorry ass
bro cam is fucking raw bro
If they keep the ball out of gio hands then they would’ve won
Sorry Nickk but you alwaysss are complaining when you got into the hoop. Always. You are a complainer.
Gio can’t fucken shoot to save his life tbh he can’t I hope he see this comment to prove me wrong in long run but stop shooting stupidly in 5s
take Carlos out and get Cam. Carlos talks to much shit and ain't doing nun
Like I just witnessed a squad win that committed at least 18 fouls each game...dafuq. Dude with the James harden grabbed almost every drive and call "all ball" but that's a clear foul 🤔😒. Like is he 🦯🦮?
Gio wise never ceases to amaze me… with how little he fucking scores.
Bro if bronny plays y’all fo sho losing
13:38 nick stop hacking
This collectively might have been the worst shot selection I’ve ever seen 😂😂 Chauncey and cam were the only ones going crazy
Great video, are you guys still playing 2hype and try to play the ballislife squad
Nick I got a team that got whoop your team and I will bet 100 dollars yall don’t even score more than 5 points, I want you to play the west or the east coast of ballislife and I promise you your team will lose, and don’t give any excuses because in these video you state that your squad is 22-0 and that y’all couldn’t get taking out by any team.
The depressed humidity consistently pack because save unusually snatch above a fine step-brother. receptive, graceful sidecar
15:20 is just crazy
Why does nick always sound like hes crying
Bro the guy in the black on the tik tok squad was cold af
Love this content bro keep doing your thing
Lmaoooo this nigga Carlos dawg
Hot garbage all the way around, yuck.
Nick just want to talk talk talk like everyone from his squad, didn't have one big fight but that is posted on his videos. At first it was funny but after month you know that his whole squad is just girls who want attention, nothing more
Can somebody tell me who played for tiktokers.i only know cam and gio
my stomach hurts🤦🏾‍♂️after watching this
How many points you got on Cam Nick? Agent 00.. 😂😂😂 and yess you can fix yo hair but you still abe Lincoln beardman.. at least you scored bum..
it should’ve been 11-11 second when white tank top scored the bucket on Chris
With refs man, y’all games would look so different
Nick is out there screaming like a school girl
Yoo
I'm sorry I hate Carlos. idk what it is and im not trying to be a hater I just hate everything he does hahaha
Does carlos has anger issue problem?
Carlos and beard are the most delusional people I’ve ever seen
7:30 Carlos looks like a monster from monsters inc
play the east coast squad
Broooo don’t play with them!!! 👨‍🍳 against em!!!!
Chris called him mini mouse!!!! I LOVE THESE VIDEOS!!!
Chauncey went off ong
Holy shit bronny👀👀👀👀👀👀
Carlos actin like a dumb@$$
Ayyyye nick was getting cooked 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When u playing 2hype
I was out getting plastered most random and childish comment I’ve ever heard out of a grown man what’d you have nick 2 white claws lmfaoooo
We need to see a dream team game, bone collector, professor, t jass, cam, nick, t jass's big man, R2, friga, jdub. Would be a mad fire game
I literally can't watch Gio play basketball 🤧 shit is cringe
Bro gio wise is so fucking shitty 😂
Nick trash as fuck he can’t go right at all 😂😂😂😂
nigga precedes to hold ol dude and have the nerve to say thats lock and all ball. I'm confused if he playing football or basketball.
I take it back…. I didn’t know you got lit the night before lol. I respect the honesty plus the video ending shout out. Y’all keep balling
Did the deformed mushroom top even score? He was talking so much shìt the whole game but he didn't to jack shìt 💀
Carlos trash talk to everyone but he didn t score a single point in 2 games ahah
What happened to the 2hype game?
Carlos back at it again getting carried with his concrete boots on.
Nick you’re getting hyped about bronny it’s not high school calm down this might be the worst squad I’ve seen lmao
I get Carlos brings the views, and he’s entertaining. But if you’re gonna bring in cam, as much as I hate to say it. I’d keep Abe over Carlos. Abe not only been hitting his shots the last few games, his defense is 30x better than carlos’s d. Carlos couldn’t really guard gio like that, and his lateral movement is that of a turtle. Abe has lock up, again bench los and bring in cam
Why is the worst player on the court talking trash? Y’all know who I’m talking about😂
Chris goated ifgaf 😂
Play Showtime
They definitely did not want to fight
“Tik tok wanted to fight” idk bout that looking like nonsense of a team out there trynna fight Christ big for nothing wish drake and Carlos is just idek bout that man lmao smh he’s really the problem he’s so bad and weak
This is Cam’s video not Nick’s 🤣
Gio can’t do anything but dribble in place ☠️
Carlos trash 🗑 so all that shit talking he be doing uncalled for 🤣🤣
Bruh hugged the shit out of him lol
First time I seen that Arab foo make 3 shots 😭😭😭
bro can you please get a new point guard… you’ve played with hella talent we wanna see an entire team have that entertainment energy you only got 4 with that right now…. no hard feeling and no offense at all just a regular og viewer that thinks that pg position should be replaced, its been long enough 🤷🏼‍♂️
How tall is Chauncey?
Chris said fucken minnie mouse 😂😂😂
Pls don’t include that Gio Kid in another vid
What happening with the 2hype rematch cause I know the 4v4 wasn’t it
The second I saw this gio dude he pissed me off and after watching this video that dude needa stay away from a basketball for the rest of his life
The kid smoked nick lmao, couldn't even guard him without hand-checking the whole time.
The nigga Abe been in the gym I never seen him score more than 2 points
I’ll really light carlos up on the court
He’s scared of what Chris you shooting another brick???
I'm a fan of carlos. be nicer to him nick
Abraham got 3 buckets in one video. That’s crazy!
Chancey is the UNSUNG hero!......dude has clutch game just doesn't yap. But love all my  Real hooper hoopers no doubt! No fan boy just keepin it 💯
Nah Lincoln showed out finally 🤣
CAM WAS PUTTIN POINTS ON NICKS HEAD 😤😤
Carlos 🤣🤣🤣
The fact Carlos was guarding dude and he ain’t do anything went 3 of 21 from deep need to stop watching and1 and play basketball hes trash, Chris did a lot of trash talking and was calling all the soft fouls but rest did their thing cam you mad nice! But come to Fort Lauderdale guy I got a team for you
Chauncey and Chris carry hard every game lmao. A good guard and the biggest guy on the court that can also dribble and shake.
It’s a difference between physical defense and just fouling every play 😂
Cam and Chauncey carried their team
I hope Carlos get y’all aired out
Blonde hair feeling shooter
carlos is so ass its not funny stop running wit him it makes u look bad
Someone please slap the shit outta Carlos 😂😂😂😂
Great to see Nick out there again
Courts going wild af!!
i love watching these videos. i check how much time i got left and shed a happy tear when i see 10 minutes still.
They got mad tik tok clips 😂😂
Gio is the biggest sellout off the last century I swear
Carlos is the 50 overall 2k build with all default animations 🤣🤣
i know for a fact there are better tik tok hoopers than these trash cans cam got with him
Chancey was onfireee!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Nick stay talking wet to Carlos like he his stepson or sum lmfao
Abe Lincoln on fire today
grown ass men hacking highschoolers just to try to fight them XD these guys are the CLOWNS
y'all gotta get walmart drake outta here. even i can take his spot on me
Abraham was huggin dude waist talking bout “all ball” lmaooooo 🤣🤣
They was foulin da shi out of Ryan like Abe kept hugging dat nigga💀💀
You guys blow. Come to Yakima WA where real ballers are tested
Carlos talked the whole game and didn't do nothing gio was making him look bad just sitting in one spot talking about you in the wrong cage got me dead😭😂😂
Pls get rid of Abe Lincoln asap
Nick: people always think we come to be disrespectful and we’re just trying to play ball Carlos: You look like a goldfish
every single nick briz video title: "Trash talkers wanted to FIGHT!!!!" when in fact it's nick's team who wants to fight anyone.
What ever happened to the Lhype rematch at 600k
Chris just need to shut up and check his ear rings for infections get a 9-5 big for nothing

Y’all need to replace Carlos with Cam
If anyone knows basketball you can call a foul the whole game nick be putting his hands on a guy all the way to the rim
Haha Iman said all ball man he hacks on every possession. When you play Friga's actual squad they going to cook him and Carlos lol
1:51 mr beast?
Cam  reallly Like thatttttt
No lie “savage squad “ calls the most fouls I ever seen
lol Carlitos, 0 points
Nick im tryna get that 100$ mann
Cash nasty ppg since 2 hype 5v5  3 points-5 games  0.6 ppg Abe Lincoln ppg since 2 hype 5v5  12 points- 10 games  1.2 ppg  Cash nasty really is trash nasty 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
If it was gonna be someone please let it be NICK BRIZ to do AN OFFICIAL TIKTOK VS YOUTUBE BASKETBALL GAME PLEASE

CARLOS 00000000000000000000000 POINTS LOL! MVP!!!!
what happened to when u aint scoring u aint talkin shit carlos and dude that look like abraham lincoln talk the most shit but dont do nothing someone gotta put them in check lmfao
Nobody talking bout cam dropping shots on nick😂🤦🏽‍♂️
17:59 AND U SMOKED THAT LMAO!!!!
Lay off the uppers.
nick briz and his team just hacking fr and they didnt count a point when it was the dude with the white shirt making the contested layup ,cam got fouled alot too also gio.18:07 the dude that pushed him is a real one
Chris… big for nothing…
Go against ballislife west  coast squad, my east coast need some avenging
Gio shoot to damn much he don't play team ball for shit SMH
Carlos is still garbage! Can’t shoot or play defense without fouling. Sub him out!
damn abraham got 3 buckets in game 2 lets go baby
Really needa take wish drake and baby face off the line up lmao
Chris always throwing them elbows like he Shaq 😂😂
Y u edit urself out when u called foul n ur team make a bucket n u said I didn't called foul. When I saw that I stop having respect 4 u n unfollow u cause I thought u was a true baller not a scrub
Mikey williams would destroy you 1 on 1
“ on yo momma “ 😂😂😂 Chauncey 🐐
bro at this point savage squad tries to start fights on purpose
Somehow, Gio makes himself look worse everytime I watch him play lol
Golden hair kid ("Rio", I think they call him) is who you NEVER want on your team 😆 Give me Carlos over him. And I'm not sure what tf that stutter-step move that he does ever accomplishes
gio has no iq when it comes to shooting or passing the ball
9:32 Chauncey talking smack about dude being too little when the dude gave a solid James Harden defensive effort lol. Bro, save the “too little” stuff for when a defender actually tries and you still score 😂😂😂😂
This would be a good 5v5 Savage squad vs Aj lapray Tanner Morgan professor Chris staples Tjass this would be good
GIO SOLDDD
If this were a league everyone in the court would’ve fouled out. Deadass would have at least 80% of game points at the line
That blonde dude looks fucking ridiculous with his feet stomps and ball throws.
Sign cam rn
Carlos got more turnovers than points 😂
Nick you be holding on defense man
Gio wise pisses me off
15:19 GG  skills better than team savage fouling & lays
Nick be playing like this is game 7
Carlos is so bad bruh😂😂
these niggas bunions. yall team overall go up with cam
Cam and gio on the same team?🤨😳🤯
BRO GIO IS ASSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Carlos is such a headshake whose got this kid out on the court talking hard?? Mans would get knocked out in 1 punch lmao Chris big for nothing we’ll just say that and where tf the fake ass drake

The Florida mfs on here make us look bad asf he said on yo momma and dude still ain’t do nun like you make us like scary😂
That's friga's move takes the ball 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Chris is savage 🤣
Cam wilder is so tuff bro he’s the only good player on the other team and has my respect
Who that slim kid with the black tee. I like him he reminds me of rhino 😂
banger🔥🔥🔥
I would love to see savage squad vs faze , obviously if theres no Bronny then theres no point of it we all wanna see how an nba bound type player would do vs savage squad
Bro y’all went out sad😭 I don’t give af that you won, but y’all niggas almost lost to a group of Tiktokers that never play together while you be playin together everyday😭
Cam Wilder cooked Nick so hard dawg
Nick stays crying about the weakest shit but hand checks and shoves the whole game on defense
Fire content 🔥🔥🔥 Cam Wilder colddd ❄️
Gio is so trash😭

Blonde kid trash af and Carlos aint make a shot in both games🤦‍♂️

Cam wilder went off
N y’all really let that dude shoot all them long ass shots n hit like 1 ? He the reason y’all lost
Finally new video!!
Am I the only one that noticed Carlos didn’t make shit but has the biggest mouth dude is a character
Abraham Lincoln talks shit and hasn't scored a bucket in over 2 months lmao 😂😂😂
I feel like 9 people were playing basketball while gio was doing something else
Anybody notice they didn't count one of the baskets?
chauncey nice w it
gio literally shoots the dumbest shots and makes one lucky one and everyone go crazy like that takes skill
Whens the tree outs I'm trying to replace Abraham
Carlos and Abraham are so ASS
Its funny that they say "they wanted to fight" but it usually be chris and Nick who be starting shit😂
8:49 nicks voice right here yo🤣🤣
14:37 shouldn’t it be 11-9? cause he just scored on chris
Bro Cam the best player on the court

Why chauncey so toxic
The guy with the Beard finally did something After 13 videos
Nah nick squad wanted to fight…. All they do is foul and say “AlL bAlL”…. And who tf gave Carlos the n word pass cuz his shii finna get took
What I’ve learned is that all u need to do to be tik tok famous is to spam hezies and pull from half court 🤦🏽‍♂️
Been a fan for a while love the savage squad keep up the good content. You know why we here😈💯💪🏽
Nick you did travel at 7:50 but I still love your videos
Blondie moved his feet fast as lighting in one spot lol than shoots a half court jumper. Carlos if you're reading this, you are the most trash player on the court lmao.
The man gets into more fights than the entire UFC combined
Chauncey and Abraham went crazy bro.

Carlos looks like that one preschooler that got mad bc a kid too his caprisun at lunch 🤣🤣
Gio looks like he knows all the moves off of 2k and practices them hoes 24-7
Cheesecake with soda
Careful what you ask for. An arrogant mind is a fool's thought.

I'm still waiting on the 2hype rematch tho
Wassup with the 2hype waiting for that vid to drop

Abraham was goin ballistic today 🤭
On fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
When y’all playing 2hype again?
Ganggg🔥🔥🔥
i've never heard sum1 talk so much shit and never scores or does shit he stay in the corner (Abraham)
Gio wise 3/20  Boy thinks he’s nice
Jungle ball at its finest  (No skills just grab n shoot)
I’m high asf this gonna be good 😏
What happen to the 2Hype rematch …?
2 things i just took from this video 1. nick can’t finish with his left hand  2. gio wise is actually that bad
Quietest Nick ever was lol
Now I see why ham is a part of Abrahams name 🔥🔥
Gio wise is so bad man
BigChaunC wet like freaking spring water from Fuji 🏔 and Abraham finally scored some rack too
Bro carlos shouldn’t be talking all that smack especially when he said “airball” he didn’t even make his shots 😩😂
That nigga Cam is not one of them
They could’ve gotten a way better tik tok team
Nick lock down on the D and Cam still hit a few buckets. That was a good matchup.
I like how carlos was talkin but aint score the whole game💀
2hype rematch?
Love the videos but cam be going off against savage squad Jesus
This one was wild 😛🥶
hold up Abraham did something
Yessir ❤️
I feel bad for savage squad they literally have a 4v5 all u see is that little leprechaun with his chia pet beard he has on him just running up and down the court doing nothing
Yo bro am I tryppin or did they do the rematch with 2hype
🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Bro y’all got to chill with that disrespect like I love your channel but one day y’all going to do that to the wrong nigga
Bro gio goes 1 for 10 and talks shit when he makes the one heave he chucks up lol that dude is so wack
$Elijaaaaah5
Let's gooooo YouTube
Chris big ass calling fouls on the court. Biggest dude on the court Shut yo big ass up and play ball. P.S. Nick was getting baked. Oven was on 350.
“you gotta dunk tHaaaaAaAt🤓”
Why is Abe Lincoln on the squad. He does nothing every video just replace him
What happened to 2 hype vs you guys ?
Cam is different
Bro cam is a certified bucket😂😂😂😭😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
Gio’s dribbles is like fingernails across a chalkboard.
Carlos buggin he had 0 calm down jit
Blonde dude should never play basketball again
carlos just out there taking up space lmao he only good for fouling and talking shit
Carlos did all that talking but did not score one basket lmao
Cam could call a foul on Nick almost every possession for this dude constantly playing defense with his hands and pushing.
Nick Brizz shirt coming soon CHAUNCEEEEEY-CHAUNCEEEEEEY 😂🤣
Aye yall should go to the courts in Albany ny and bring that energy
Gio Wise is a joke 😂
Carlos be making me pissed sometimes
Im ready for this one nick just about to start watching it right now😭by the way flight and cash need to react to this 💀💀
Perfect example of Team play vs Iso ball everyone on tik tok want the highlight smh
Chauncey with green shorts 🤫🏀🔥
kid with the orange hair needs to go. wtf he doingggggg
Nick the goat ong
Nick vs Faze? Can't wait to see how you guys try to fight them.
Why is Abraham on the team?  That dude a straight bum and probably scores once every 4 games. This his career high, 3 Fgs made in one game.
Can blonde do anything else besides spider dribble and miss ?
Gio would’ve had to see me in the parking lot if we were teammates 😂
Who ever da dude was talkin shit with the orange head band didn’t score it one time 😂😂 bro couldn’t even lock gio
Bro why my boy Abraham Lincoln actually score this vid lol
carlos : “ur ass or not even scoring”, is 0 for 2 in two games lmao
Can someone please clip Carlos on his jaw this man is so fake
U way past 600k. When y’all playing 2hype again. Last time was a movie fr
the cam shots were craaazy wtf💀
I only seen 1 person with a mask on this whole video 😭
I seen this on another channel like a week ago
Ain’t no way cam hit that 15:20
This old
Your good at basketball nick
what happened to the 2hype rematch?
Then you have gio playing around wit Carlos 😭 if gio was trying and had more weight the game would have been over 😭🤷🏾‍♂️
Y’all can’t play d an foul but call every foul?
I didn't think there was a worse player than Carlos. Bleached hair kid proved me wrong
Fire vid🔥
Chris complaining about getting stiff armed when he stiff arms every play on offense and defense. What a chump
Abraham: I’M LIKE THAT!!!!  The whole audience:  No you not
They gone talk shit to everybody but Bronny when they play just watch😭😭
Carlos take the most shit but is the worst player on the court 😭 the other boul that had 6 points was open every time he can’t be talking shit 🤡
Nick what happen 😭😭😭
Aye keep grinding bro🔥💯
Tattoos
Maaaan these videos be a train wreck
When the 5v5 against 2hype happening? After they recover from injury imo is the best so no excuses
Abraham flexing his 6 points
#savagesquadstandup
Put some respect on gio name
Bru, I died when dude told Carlos he had a $5 jersey😂   17:40
stopped watching at 2:32. Too many missed shots. Yall are truly really bad. This just hurts to watch
Lincoln be saying hand on ball but he doesnt know he only can use 1 hand and cant do it over the top :D
carlos always talking the most while doing the least 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
God Abraham and Carlos are just horrible 🤦🏻‍♂️😭
“I got plastered bro, I didn’t think they were hoopers” bro they’re the REAL hoopers … lmao you the dude who just has hops & only time u make a 3 is if it’s wide open 😂😂😂
Cam could've won if Gio wasn't so fucking awful lmao. Dude went 1-40.
Abraham Lincoln does the most talking & don’t do shit 😂 Carlos too but I fuck with Carlos he be getting his at times 😂
All yal do is talk shit travel/walk and call fake fouls
i think this was the first time i’ve seen abe lincoln score
Gio is actually horrible
Emon swear he hard 😂 but he balled out today🔥🔥🔥
Only good tiktoker is the big ass light skin I respect that mans cause he actually a hooper
On that dudes air all he shot way before he touched his arm lmao
Cam shitted on you
Let us get another Chris on the court drop Carlos off
Where’s the 2hype rematch I wanna see you smoke that 2hype pack again
idk bro name, but the dude with the chinstrap gotta shave that shit
Bruh Cam is absolutelly crazy at this point, shooting in everybodys face like its nothing
Carlos is the worst player I’ve seen in awhile..but talks the most shit bruh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Gotta give credit where it’s due I enjoy watching Nick play when he not talking allat shii, he jus be hoopin and that’s what it’s about fr 💯
8:57 x 9:52  15:20  Cam 👀
It looks like YALL wanted to fight and not them. Yall tryna scrap with errbody I swear
Anyone else think Chris just yells and cry’s and calls bs fouls? He’s corny as hell. Please get a good big man that can play and not talk all game
Why no boxing fucking boring to much talk
Watch anyone on nicks team when they play D… nothing but hands 😂
Can somebody shut the guy in the mic up?? He ain’t even entertaining.
Yo I can't stand Gio Wise. He's just dribble in one spot and just throws the ball hoping it goes in.
15:46 @nickBriz you travel a lot u need to work on your game cuz
Chauncey really be getting people heated out here good stuff 🔥
Did carlos even get a bucket lol
I convinced Carlos was a crack baby
Finally arab Lincoln scores
Ummm idk if I was watching the score right but when in the second game when the score was 8-11 the white shirt grey shorts guy scored on Chris when Chris said “he fucking stiff armed me” but their score didn’t go up from 8 to 9. At that point it shidve been 11-9. Then Cam pulled a fade-away on nick for a 2 which shudve made it 11-11 tied up. Idk tho I’m just saying I peeped the score didn’t go up🥱🤷🏽‍♂️
Some notable stuff, great to see abraham do more than just cardio for the first time. That mushroom hair dude like trae young, 4-50 from way near half court, ones he make he celebrates like he like that. And cam out her by himself
7:08 the sequel continue with Chris 🤣
Bro the guy with the beard that always wear a hat talking so much shit but drops 0 in every game😭😂
Carlos next video gotta show us something I don’t remember seeing him score bruh Abraham popped off so did cam
i ain’t even notice abe lincoln was on the court till the end of the vid
Carlos plays like he studied Flights game film
same w carlos dudes gimmick is old
I’ve never seen 5 people hack so badly Jesus Christ.
I swear they put that blonde Asian kid on the other team as sabotage.
Idc what anybody say this channel is more entertaining than any of the basketball channels I’ve watched. 👍👍👍 keep going nick!
I’m not even a basketball type of person but I watch all Nick vids he rlly the 🐐 💚 And my mans be keeping that energy never back down🔥
Between Cam and Nick, Cam is clearly the superior player...dude was hitting tough shots after tough shots, Nick on the other hand couldn't  make a layup to save his life.
Aye y’all boys come to Charlotte North Carolina I gotta 5 for y’all 5 😈😈😈
Carlos is sooo garbage 🗑 😂😂💀 he’s the only man to shoot 1-20 fg and still talk shit lol
Tik tok squad was missing @ZeroBounce
Bronny won’t play respect you y’all but he ain’t risking injury because y’all want to play street ball
Let’s go fireeeeeeeee
I respect nick so much after this video
Nick you something else boi
chris is wack bruh his gimmick is oldddd
Why does Carlos keep running his mouth when he’s probably the worst player out of all those people at the court that day…dude is a bum, Nick.
Bruh somebody tell gio work on doin one move and goin to make a layup or floater like damn
Where’s the 2hype rematch???
You guys should get rid of Carlos. He's not that good and talks too much.
If i ever run into  carlos im fuckin him up, make dude scared to even say hi to some1......carlos day is comin w his mouth poppin off like that
Imans best game ever haha
I bet playing with gio wise is annoying as fuck. Dude only shoots those dumbass half court shots
It’s time to cut Carlos off… he makes y’all look stupid
Y’all fr got me different letting someone like Carlos get in my face
Yrg in the bulding
Abraham finally scored
Carlos told that boy to hit the weight room with out saying a word
Came from the Gram, Banger 🐐🗣
Nick come to LA bro
Carlos talking all that shit with a 0 on his head
I just wanna know how in the fuck nobody has slumped Carlos yet for talkin mad wild all the time
$100
Chauncey has every right to talk his sh*t 😂
Carlos so annoying
Gio did all those fancy moves to just miss 99% of the time but he makes one and swears he’s the shit 🤣 Carlos put him in his place
u also said 600k rematch wit 2hype
How you not at 1m yet?
Chris super under rated, best player💯
Everyone on that tik tok squad trash 🤦🏽‍♂️
Y’all was hand checking 🤦🏽‍♂️
Nick kept fouling that afro kid. Hands out,pushing everytime he went to drive in
Bruh Carlos saying the other guy scored none when he hasn’t scored anything 🤣
Besides the blonde guy, Carlos may be the biggest on court liability I've ever seen.
Carlos talk too much for him to not have made any shots 😂
7:34 BOY TRAVELED TO THE MOON 🌚 CAMOOONN
SAVAGE SQUAD UP✅✅🗣🗣
Bro can was cooking nick fr smh
What happened to the 5v5 rematch vs 2hype at 500k?
Nick lowkey be holding lighskin dude like it’s good defense lol
Carlos needs to be off the team seriously...Replace him with Cam
I really can’t tell if Carlos is special or not
I want someone to clock Carlos sooo bad
Abraham Lincoln finally redeemed himself!!!
U dont want to mess with chris cuz he will get some kind of rage and go off on u lol
🔥 these videos always be lit
Good lord nick n his team b foulin
Great Content, Cam will make yall so much better. Jus sub out Beard
Gio sold shouldn't have picked him up
9:38 Said thats lock all ball hes legit wrapping up dudes entire body holding both his arms down hahahaha Abraham Lincolns whack whats he contribute to this team he never scores he cant play D hes like 4 ft 10 for real whats he bring value wise to Savage Squad cus i dont see it lol
What happened to the 2hype rematch 🤔
Nick got no shot 😂 he will drive and if he doesn’t make it he calls for a foul lmao
What is gio doing 😂😂 All his shot attempts were awful he genuinely thinks that those are good shot attempts? How does he not get embarrassed when he does that shit 😂
Get nick too a million im trynna watch nick player everyone!
Bro I wish I can play with y’all so bad
Again, this is gonna die out quickly if Chris and you call foul every touch but guys like Cam and Friga are driving against CONSTANT pushing and body contact AND shooting fouls and trying to play through it. You’re winning games off inconsistency in physicality and then just yelling at people if they try to resist because nobody cares enough to keep arguing😂😂😂
Nice to see Briz being the big dog and a good leader this vid
Best part was Carlos running the fast break lol
y’all gotta get someone to replace carlos dawg he’s way better at trash talking than playing basketball, keep him on the sidelines for support or something
Y’all gotta feed Carlos more my boy got all the gear on for nothing
$KingAaron300
I swear inside the paint Chris is just built different. His lay ups and spin move off the back board is deadly. Gotta love a big man that’s good in the paint. Props Chris!!!
Bro gio is actually good 😳
Bad shit i would neva lie
Savage squad cant be stoped😡😈
Briz, Chauncey, Cam, and Chris is a scaryyyyy 4 that'd be dope
Someone tell Gio to leave
Yessir 🥶🥶
SAVAGE SQUAD on that dumb shit 😈💯💯💯💯💯
Savage squad 😤
boy gave nick bucketsss😭😭
W vid 😬
The dude in the blonde dribble too much which messes up his shooting because he wasted his energy on dribbling instead trying to figure out a way to create his shoot against his defender plus he needs to take it up more tbh
When you have this many people watching you and your whole team acts like delinquent teenagers, it’s extremely embarrassing for you guys
Cam better than half they team
The amount of swishes 😅 ❤
Nick your squad is so ass, if it wasn’t for Chauncey y’all would lose every game, @me if you want soft boy 😘
That boy chauncey was cookin out there 🍳🔥🔥
14:30 we aint keeping score?
Yall should come to Mayfield,KY on Sunday and play against some of the locals
Nick play like an old head
I liked Nick and his team for a long time but I gotta say, they need humbled extremely bad. All they do is talk s*** and try to start fights. Play the game, it’s not MMA, its basketball. They all seem like they snort a line of coke before they play now or something
Chauncy and abe are finally back lol
Cam dont play them scrubs no more nick hamd check u the whole time no defense foul everytime. Then little dude on savage team was hacking young blood all game too. Talking about good defense . Nick ur trash one move run at u and jump in air no skill set at all. 💯💪🏿💪🏿
You tell blonde dude watch Steph Curry videos over and over again‼️🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️😂😂😂♐
8:42 that gotta be one of the worst shot attempts I’ve ever seen from Gio
SAVAGE SQUUUUAAD
Idgaf Carlos is ass
Nick’s on ball defense is a never ending sequence of fouls
7:54what a dime 👍🏽
$brooklyndagoat6
Big man pushing off 😂 big for nothing
If i had the ball for everytime gio shot we wouldve beat yall💯
yall was fouling them boys the whole time  😂😂😂😂
yeisrrr as always getting the dub keep yo shit up
I ain’t never see Abe do anything
Nick should worry about himself Instead of yelling at teammates 😂 got scored on then missed cmon now.
shoes
Glad I found your videos one day! I have went and watched everyone of them now and watch all the new ones keep it up bro you and savage squad are taking over! 💯💪😈
Who is the one in the mix matching shows
Just wacthed
No cap, the dude with the mismatch shoes is disgusting

👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
My man with the beard needs more offense but he's definitely got D on lockdown
These are obv scripted cos if he played our sqaud Chris and nick be koed Philly boy if they started that crazy trash talk
Fire 🔥
Yo nick you needa get rid of Carlos he gone be the death of y’all lol he shooting like that? Talking the most lol you Chauncey and Chris do a 3v3 squad y’all would be unbeatable
Bruh nick cheated the score when lightskin dude scored over Chris he didn’t  count the point…
gio is so trash i can’t believe he has a following
Cam is too tuff 🔥
We can all admit the other team lost cause gio missing all those 3s
gio wise boo boo as hell hhahahaha
how is carlos talking with 0 points and he disrespected the Kobe’s i’m done
Man said YRG in the building GOAT
Carlos talk the most but don’t support it
Carlos goofy asf hahahaaa
Dat Abraham niggah special ed😂😂😂he deadass forced a foul and said its clean
Carlos-“you not even scoring” Carlos didn’t make shit the whole game
This team’s unstoppable fr
Gio wise could easily be a deadly point guard if he just practices his shots and practices on driving in. He has the handles and speed to create space for jump shots.
When yall finding a replacement for Carlos
Chris literally the cringiest  lmao
Nick stfu you got your ass whoop 😂😂😂 you was just talking shit about friga doing this “ Oh i understand estimated these guys” you may have won the game but you still got multiple 3s to the face 😂😂😂
Real talk, you need to cut buddy with the fake beard for cam that dude can ball no 🧢  🔥🔥 vid
Wassup with nick  ,manz be missing open free layups/dunks. Man has like 9 attempts but like 3 of them go in 😳
Carlos is so bad and he runs his mouth like he’s even good
Never thought I see the day where Abraham scores more than once
best content. forget friga.
I feel like if Carlos is going talk he got to  At least score uh point
Carlos might be the worst basketball player I have ever seen
Abraham yells "all ball" while he's wrapping LOL
🔥🔥🔥
The Saudi Arabia dude on Nick team is really ass drop him already
This shit is fire bro
Gio wise has to be the worst thing that has ever happened to basketball Jesus Christ
It’s amazing how trash’s nicks team is friga plays against real talent nick plays against the nighas who don’t get picked up
Carlos had 0 in BOTH games and is talking crazy…LMFAO🤣
Carlos is trash at trash talking🤦🏾‍♂️
“Nigga got a $5 dollar jersey on.” 😂😂😂😂 That jersey is some bullshit 😂
This shit lit
Nah man cam needs to call out Carlos, Carlos stay talking shit like he can’t hold him
Abraham and Carlos maddd annoying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yo Gio selling hard no cap
Damn what happened to the video quality?
Everyone except Chauncey is trash. Nick plays shit defense without hugging and holding the whole time.
Carlos gets more annoying every video🤣 him and Abe Lincoln delusional frfr
That afro guy jumper is smooooth. They lost cos of Gio, no 🧢 gotta drop him if they wanna win next time
abraham was playing for more pt ong hahaha
Nick can’t guard dat boy cam man lmaoo
Gio made em lose bruh 💀
Why do people watch this lame ass fake thug squad anymore? Legit all of them talk that shit like they’re tough and the only one with hands is Chauncey.
I would hate it if Gio was on my team taking them wild ass shots that boy trash even his dribbles is trash he dont do nothing with them dribbles he just moves his feet fast he shouldve been a tap dancer
I need the 500?
Nick taking all the views from ball is life 🤣
Aye no cap , savage squad nice w it , Carlos the only one that’s ass , he talked shit this whole game and didn’t score a SINGLE Point . Y’all dummy nice y’all just gotta start being humble no cap
YRG IN THE Building

Keep doing your thing Nd dropping these bangers my guy🔥🔥
carlos best sg in the world
Why is that man carlos the one that talks the most but done nothing on the team😂😂
Nick go left everyday really fast and jump high

You know it's some bad shooting when Carlos gets on your behind about how bad they were.  Gio with some horrendous attempts . Get in the gym bud, and practice shooting.

Cage boy 😂😂😂😂😂000
The blonde haired dude is the random kid in gym who just shoots anything
Yo Carlos talk a lot of shit and don't do nothing

carlos didnt even score, he just talks shit
That dude with the clown hair was just making noise with his shoes like a dumbass he wasn’t doing shit😂
5:35 he didn’t even do anything idk why they gettin hyped like he broke his ankles or somethin  Edit: when gio wise hit Carlos with the ball he still didn’t do anything either idk why people think he did somethin.
Who else hates seeing the top comment during the ad  that spoils the video before u even watch it
Nick was zoned in
Always fun to watch!  Thanks for the game gentlemen!
Big man Chris can’t make left hand layups
Carlos is so ass and still trash talks 💀

I’m gonna buy Chauncey some new shorts bro 😂
Gio wise idk man I think I’d beat you 11-0 or even 21-0 man you takin the wildest shots ever
LETS GO SAVAGE SQUAD😤
Nick is a goat. Trash talking, yet backs it up with dubs. 💯🏀
Carlos is 🗑️
I see Nick has been stealing some defensive hacking workouts from Carlos recently😂🤦🏾‍♂️
This shit was fireeeeeeeee!!!
wtf is wrong wit carlos he ruins everything
carlos didnt even have a bucket abraham stepped up tho
Beard dude trash
Yo love the vids man keep up the great work
Anyone else think carlos might be lowkey a little special 😂💀
The first video gio was playing like he just found crack for the first time
gio might be the worst pickup player EVER wtf... even the shots he made i woulda been mad af he took.
Cam got game! But that other guy gio 🗑 i would hate to be on a team with that guy & carlos gon end up getting beat up bad 1day
Nick fr the goat 🐐
come 2 seattle washington 😂
Been watching nick since he been hooping indoors after smoking blunts lol! Dope to see these vids!
I hope to see that but the hostility is becoming bs. Play ball less talk........
Come on Carlos. Can’t hit a damn shot and a open layup.
Nik is hacking
Nick and the Savage squad need some competition they schooling everybody on alll platforms
The only reason I watch is in the hopes that Carlos gets rocked into next week. The worst player on the court and talks the most shit
Why Carlos was talking all that, he ain’t score nun 😂😂
cam actually cooollddd tho god damn 😂
Stop Playing With Em’….slowly taking over as the 👑 of the irl basketball community
abraham lincoln: “IM LIKE THAT!” nooo… no your not buddy 😂😂😂
Nick Brizz is the goat
i thought cam and gio aint like each other
Respect carlos bro, he has the biggest mouth in the league although he's not even scoring 😂
Why Chauncey say “fuck u boy”to the dude In the orange shoes ? He was getting buckets and not saying nothing . Of course he gotta luck on the weak 😂
Nah cam was disrespecting nick with those shots
savage squad foul so much its hard to watch
Nick carries his team so many times bro I swear!👍🏻
ryan and cam are actually like nasty
Finally got to see my boy Iman ball out
bruhh that dude wit the shirt that says "beast", he always there lmaooo
Abraham went off 💯
Nick u no bronny James lil boy ..
Sheesh cam a baller
Thats shit going lit 🔥 Bronny James the game going off the chain ⛓ can't wait  700k subs real close want u win 52k away bro God bless 🙏
The savage squad only bullying them cause they young as hell but wanna be like “it’s all positivity” when they go to the hood and a gun gets pulled on em
The teenage fanboys kind of ruin any sort of intensity.
carlos is a sorry ass baller😭
carlos talked the most and aint score once
All of y’all are trash but Chauncey 🤷🏽‍♂️
Cam really like that
No one wants to play with y’all bum squad 😂😂😂   “Savage” squad more like the cringe squad.   Nick, you’re white. Talk like it.
Cam fucked em up
yall not playin good oponents. people who cant play and yall talking trash. ok
Fuck em tik tokers 😈😈😈🔥🔥
play ball is life either coast and you will lose 100%
I literally live for these videos good ass content ‼️ Nick definitely the best hooper on YouTube with the best content hands down
I like how Carlos is shit taking cam on a airball 3 which he got fouled on and Carlos ass hasn’t scored the whole day😂
What happen with the game with 2hype?
If nick isnt on a fast break he can’t score haha Carlos is trash can. What does Abe Lincoln actually do? And what is baby food???? All y’all suck
Is the point to make people watch to dislike this team. Nic B defense is constant hand check garbage. Carlos is annoying as shit & lucky if he hits an open 3 & can’t even make a lay up. Abe Lincoln literally fouls on D & truly can’t play. Big man is like a broken record with the same catch phrase & single dimensional personality. Chauncey is the one who actually seems like he can hoop. Respect to him balling with the bozo’s of insecurity.   I used to watch & like. After a few episodes it’s the same fake/garbage crap. Enjoy naive kids
Need to come to Grand Rapids, real hoopers up here stgg clam up everybody
Yoo
Sometimes they little to disrespectful when it comes to the end of the game. That shit kinda wack other than that this shit entertaining
Cam ate you guys up!
Chris need to start handing out pacifiers. Baby food lol
If Gio did not shoot that many shoots prob Cam's team might win one game
17:16 Russian basketball
Nigga cam is crazy😂😂🚫🧢
16:55  you all gonna know what  happen next when cam shoots an airball after some crazy wide range shit, big mouth carlos
Gio air balls 4 in a row then finally makes one and starts acting like he’s really like that.
These TikTokers throwin the ball up hoping it goes in. Their bums FR.
You guys need to come to Durham NC so we can get some good run in , I got my team 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Carlos: You’re ass you haven’t even scored!!! Also Carlos: Hasn’t scored
Nawwww savage squad showed out this video! Good runs fr
You can tell they on that tic tac shit with all them dumb ass haircuts 😂
Ain't Nick like 25? That high pitched squeal when he gets mad is killing me
Yessir🔥
Keep grinding Nick 💪🏽✅👏🏽 This is🔥
Yessir
Ngl Nick lightskinned buddy had like 10 on you
Abe Lincoln don't know rules lol he wrapping and saying all ball
Nick is literally just foulin cam bro
Carlos had no buckets and was talking bout being in a cage maybe we should put you in a cage with a hoop so you can work on your shot
Cam and Gio got the fucking clips
Nick briz the goat fr who y’all know droppin park games and gettin a million plus views every time 🤟🏾
nick didn’t talk shit this whole video i’m surprised
We need to get a  “fuck is they talkin bout” compilation lol
How Carlos finna tell someone they don’t even score while he has zero points and they got more than him. And he calls air ball like he don’t air ball almost every game
Where’s the 2hype vid u said @600k
W video once again, nick doesn’t disappoint 🥱🥱🥱
Gio Wise would actually be an insane player if he had better shot selection. They could have won if he didn't heave pointless half court shots all game.
IMA APE
Gio pisses me off
Gio is useless on the court he chooses to do bullshit when he could help win
This whole video had like 60 fouls bruh 💀😭
Nick is raw people don’t understand he makes clutch shots when they matter ,would love to see friga real 5 against savage squad😈
“on YO momma” coldest line i’ve heard in a while 😂
I hate playing wit niggas like Gio... mans dribbled for 40 seconds shot a long range like he was Stephen  Curry
Bruh in the first game really mad about screens 🤣🤣🤣 like if that wasn’t part of the game, clown ass
Carlos’s finishing is like a F-
Tik tokers getting ran through is what i'm living for 😈
Gio gets me tight especially that last possession. Imagine you cam hitting those wild shots and then that bozo makes ya lose the game like that
$AlexBirrueta
Carlos don't have to score to be MVP
When y’all gonna pull up to Rucker Park?
10:25 BETTER FOUL
dude with beard is absolutely garb carlos is better then him
THATS GOODIES BABYYYYYYYYY
Guess it’s time to get blonde hair and do the same dribble 20 times and make 4 shots and get act like I’m good or something
Hell of a game. So much talent
Gio sold badly
On 😈 timing as usual 🔥
Wait so why cam and gio on the Same team if they don’t like eachother and were supposed to 1v1?
It was a whole bunch of fouling y’all boys needed calm down on the disrespect
2:15 gio took 3 dribbles and went to the basket good job
Loving all the content but please get something to stabilize the videos.
Cam needa join savage squad, team be tuff.
‼️‼️PLEASE‼️‼️ 8:43 Somebody ban Gio Wise from basketball for the rest of his life‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Nick been rocking with your stuff since before 10K! Keep running up the numbers and the entertaining content! Loving it!
I loved it when Chris got scored on 😭😭
Look at Abe man so inspirational
When is y’all playin 2Hype
Abs Lincoln thinks he hits all ball be be fouling the shit out of people but he finally hit shots
All Carlos did this video was yell lol
Little beard man who makes a shot like 1/5 videos lmao. Also funny when he bear hugs a dude who blew by him and then yells "all ball" lmao.
Why y’all keep ducking the score. I’m starting to not respect it. It’s supposed to be 11-11 at 15:28
Why you cutting out their hype moments 😂😂🤦🏿‍♂️
Y’all always on that SHIT 🤣🤣 $Cashbam1
Who is the weak ass dude with the blond hair 🤣
Chauncy and Cam the best 5sho with out a doubt nick come in a close 3rd
Only Carlos can fuck up a 2 on 1 fast break😂
carlos just yells and misses everything lmao
That step back cam hit🤢🤢🤢oh my
I think GIO’s coach is julian newman?more on dribbling, too much on turnovers and miss shots.
Idk what made me more mad, Gio throwin up deep as shots for no reason, even beat his man once and still took a damn step back 3, or the fact this Abraham dude straight up bear huggin his matchup and yelling all ball when probably not even his pinky touched the ball.
Abe needs to stfu
Yesssssir ❗️❗️🔥
Wwww
the takeover 🔥
Cam is a bucket
Carlos made 0😭 why is he on that team talking
@crswht you down bad when you get beat down low😂😂
Respect to Cam, But Gio man he gets on my nerves honestly he's a good dribbler but his IQ is terrible.
HOOOOOLIES !!!! ( lowkey a $100 wouldn’t hurt 🙈💯)   $Gmoneymakers
When Carlos bitch smacked the dude in the other video had me dead 💀
Fire video 🔥
love the intensity in every video 🔥
Cam was really babying Nick 😂😂😂
SAVAGE SQUAD 🔥 🔥
Cam fucked nick up bad
Abe Lincoln was going off 🔥🔥😮‍💨
You guys should pick cam up
You got cooked, and Carlos doesn’t need to be on that court. Dudes annoying and needs to get rocked.
man Carlos is so bad
🥶
Savage squad is so tuff💯…..I think they underrated also
GGs
😎
Half court shots?  Why?  Shuffle feet, pretend to be And 1, launches prayers. 17:45 Shuffles feet really fast does nothing.
bro gio wise should not be famous at all. hes ass at what he does. he aint even got an entertaining personality either. how tf did that man blow up. dribbling and airballing bruh wtf
⛽️
Tough 🔥
16:09 my boy jdub fine asf 😍
Old mate carrot top with 3 of 15 from 4 point range needs to expand his game and drive!
Yo keep grinding gang🖤😈

Respect for posting these Ls niggas be hating

Love the content bro 💯
Bih stay flying
MOST ENTERTAINING SQUAD IN THE GAME
Pay my bills
Everyone like this if you think Gio Wise need to put down the basketball and try swimming or some shit lmao 😂
Chauncey need a camera crew and a microphone 💯 shiiiiii
ayo cam is insane🐐‼️
Nick is hungover and still better then all the Tiktok dudes😭😭
Actually like Gio and Cam as a duo tbh , but Cam was hoopin hoopin
Bronny aint playing. LeBron would never allow that
No Word Of A Lie, They Lost Cuz of The Lil Homiee Wise With Dam Ugly 3’s 🤦🏾🤦🏾
Y’all should play against Ballislife crew to see if y’all really good , because so far y’all scared against real Comp like D1 hoopers because y’all would definitely get exposed. 😂😂😂🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️💯🗣🗣
Please embarrass flight
Awesome 👍🏾
Abe and Carlos need to be traded talkin like Nick and Chance deserve to
This is by far the worst ball is life squad 😂🤣 squad full of bums 🤣🤣😂
Ok if u read this now u can give me the 100 grams, ty .. gratz for peru 🇵🇪
Gio Wise the MVP
heated
yall need to play Ballislife West Coast RT
Keeps getting more entertaining and competitive each week!!! Nice!!!
In the first 5000, run the 100 😤
Ngl I don’t know none of those fucking weak ass tiktokers except gio and cam that’s all😭 every other person IRRELEVANT
Nick briz 🔥
Carlos gotta chill like he ain’t ass , he the hype man who suck
Carlos talked the most trash but scored 0 points my gosh 😂
Cam was killing Nick 😂
Great vid
You know what's funny. Chris stays fouling ppl but when he gets fouled he cry's like a big ass baby. And he's a huge shit talker and a freaking bully. Carlos and Chris are hella disrespectful for no reason..
Cam from deep is crazyy
Awesome vid
Chauncey wanted all the smoke in this video sheesh
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
I ain't gonna lie it was 16-11 or 15-11 bro Gio and Cam and Chauncey Balled out
Chauncey woke up and chose violence today
Chris got way better
♻️♻️♻️
🦅🦅🦅🦅
faze game gone be a show they both know entertainment for sure !
Chris finally got his pair
Dude with blonde hair sums up how I imagine a lot of internet hoopers play.   They have handles and can dribble in ways that look flashy, but they really don't ever capitalize by making the defender off balance.   No need to bite on all the head/ball fakes when you never drive lol.
Yooooooooo shits 🔥
this was the most silent nick briz video
Nick lowers his shoulder every time he drives lmao he thinks it’s football
U really a click baiter 😭
yooo vid was crazy as usual willing to play if y’all come more down south to miami 💯💯
Keep grinding broo you’re definitely number one in this street ball shit much love nick!

I love how throughout every game the energy never changes
All your videos fire nick 😈
“Tighten up before I break your jaw, on your mama” 😂😂😂 that’s tough!
A team that played together for a few months against first time teammates not that bad of a game tiktokers put up a good fight Lowkey

Bruh wtf did I just watch...lol
Abe Lincoln got a career high 💀
That blonde dude just moves his feet fast and launches prayers..
Love the vids
Carlos did absolutely nothing.. dudes ass
Chris is actually pretty skilled and efficient
this squad is too fun to watch 💯😈
Does anyone even like announcers at the park? The commentary is always so obnoxious. Like be quiet no one thinks you're funny
Yessir nick got his shit off, love to Carlos too shit always entertaining 💯
Savage squad got some good ass defense
Chris just be saying anything 💀 “fucking Minnie Mouse”
Damn every video nick either blows a layup or misses a wide open dunk lmao this is getting out of hand
Cam and Ryan showed out. Gio sold.
🔥🔥
No offence but Gio did so many dumb plays like they could won the second game if he just past the ball
Geo you suck bro just stop all them shots you taking bro like 2/14 the second game lol
Carlos getting benched next game 🤣🤣🤣
Carlos get so scary running to the rim he just throws the ball and runs out of bounce! Super ass Carlos spring greeeeeen
I would cuss the 💩 out of that lil tik tok twerp if he were on my team shooting it from half court. Does he really think there is a soul on earth that wants to play on the same team with that garbage mentality? Making 1 out of every 10 he shoots? I wouldn’t even run back on D after that 💩.
Nick I'll be honest the extra funny stuff I'm not a fan of you and ya crew be on. Plus I see all my hand checking on this channel lol
Would love be in the Audience for this. Looking so hype.
this is the most i’ve ever seen abe Lincoln score
I can’t take a guy seriously if he has a tik tok shirt on lmao
Cam and gio finally getting along
Carlito cannot be stoped and Chauncey is 100% Savage material he on some black Air Force timing 😭
Dam nick was hand checking like crazy lmao
Yes yo someone plz tell ABE HE AINT LIKE THAT , first game 1 point , 2nd game 3/4 woooowww , most points you’ve scored since you been on, congrats , ALL ABE is good for is his trash ass defense (hacking/fouling) n being a WACK a$$ HYPE MAN sitting at 5’5 tops , SIT DOWN!! Only Nick , Chauncey, & Chris got my respect as hoopers , Carlos been some $hit (thumbs down)
Nick Briz Savage Squad YESSSSSIRR
You guys are just acting like clowns now
Muhammad Chinstrap made 1 three and “I’m like that” 😂😂 You trash Muhammad
Who let that Amish boy play.
Dam nicks jumper soo ugly!! Lmaoo ayyyyyy
first time ive ever seen Gio made anything lol
Abe Lincoln dropping 3,nick got defense and can shooting from deep
If Abe Lincoln doesn't lie, then why he says he is "LikE ThAT"...🤨
Lincoln made more shots in this one video than he did the whole last year
Bruh he keep mentioning bronny y’all better not foul him crazy like every other 5v5

Damn Gio you just fucked up a good ass game no wonder why Carlos beat you so easy on a 1v1
Nick Briz yall crew stay lit 🔥 asf all yall do is  WIN 🌟🌟simple 💯💯
first video carlos didn’t air ball in😂
Y’all trash af really 😂  All the hacking and bs calls
Carlos talks the most shit but is ass asf kinda cringe and Abe Lincoln never scored his entire career and scores 3 times this game and think he’s the shit nick is the only decent one
Why cut out the reaction at 10:38? That's wack lol. Show it all
Abraham stole Carlos powers 😆
keep rolling.. you guys are killing it
he made the point and it still said 8 points yall finessed
funny how ppl talk about how players suck but don’t even know how to play basketball
Savage squad fr the best team on YouTube
Y’all need to stop Carlos man hits nothing and he’s the biggest menace to the game
Carlos talk shit but aint scored both games and whole video🤣🤣😭😭
We not gonna talk about what happened at 7:50 😂
Bro nick briz is the best on YouTube Rn 🔥🐐

Carlos was really tryna press a lil tiktoker at the end 🤣
Carlos literally will not score for a couple UPLOADS but still call people out their name...
I'd whup Gio Wise's ass if he played on the same team as me .... doing all that bullshit dribbling and constantly throwing up prayers with low hit ratios!
I can’t handle how tough these dudes act after every play BUT here I am, waiting on the next vid 😂  Shit is mad entertaining 🤙

Nick got exposed fr
Y’all are goofy
Nicks getting worse but nicer. Chris getting better. Carlos is Carlos. Chauncey is fking savage. I think that’s everyone
Nick y’all cheated the second game  soon they score when they had 8 why it didn’t switch to 9
Nick look a lil suspect 🥴
Carlos ain’t score once and he still talking all that
Dude with the red head band fr rarely missed the 3
Kinda sad that Chris carries the team all the time 😂😂😂
Other people see nick negative cause of what he does on camera with the trash talking and shit but nah nick is a great guy off camera !! He respects everyone off camera ! Even with friga they still show love to each other off camera ! My respects to nick💯💯
You and your squad bring the intensity out of everyone y’all play 🔥🔥🔥$EdwardH51
Banger
Was that the same dude on the mic that was finna fight Chris? Or is this the same court?
Love you broo keep grinding
Dudes just CHUCKIN up long 3's. I hate that shit!!!
Still undefeated 🔥🔥
No Dunk???
Great video bro bro
Wait Gio and cam on the same squad?🤔
Every title they wanted to fight I swear this is the most staged content
They’re all clowns except Chauncey 😂
14:48 Carlos,  at the end of your shot rather then keep your fingers straight like that, work on curling your fingers down like your making believe your putting them into the basket...it helps the completion of the follow through and over time will higher your FG%. You need to end your jump-shot with a flick, not a push
What A Battle!!!
W Video!!
Chauncey took this game personal
Carlos gets absolutely dusted every time ☠️🤣
Damn first time hearing announcer this shit legit 😆😆😂😂
Fucking goats the takeover continues
The only way tiktokers lose is if goo got the ball bru
Yessssir GG great vid🙌🙌👌
Wowww nick sorry asf he didn’t count that point😭
I’d rather listen to nails on a chalkboard then watch Gio play
Cam your game is respectable your nice wit the rock
Ryan was on demon time Abe Lincoln could not guard bro
Great vid bro keep grinding love the vids ❤️
Y’all can’t lie nick was clanpin up cam
replace abraham with cam yall would be unstoppable
Cam on savage squad is too OP😭💯
19:19  Cam Wilder can play for us anytime he wants.  I like it.
gio and cam showed out fr
Cam is too slow driving the ball. If he had that quickness he'd be a lot more dangerous.
Missed a point in the score.
GIMME 100 BIHG DAWG
Nick and cam gotta play together fr fr💯
Bro you & the squad are legends out here already! SavageBoyz 🤙🏽🤙🏽
Bro abe Lincoln be hugging someone then instantly yell he got all ball mad annoying
Nick baller!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Crash Dummy Gang🤼🏾‍♂️
Make sure to put “fight” in the description to sucker people to watch y’all trashy scrubs play ball if that’s what u call it, Cam n Chauncey only ballerz out there. Savagely Sad Squad
I really wanna see the professor run a 5 on 5 against these guys
Nick hook it up. My baby needs diapers and formula
Gio and Carlos are cold 🤣🤣
First game all savage squad but that second game is a debate to much foulin f
Isn’t it purpose to be 11-11
I fuck with nick cus he can be humble when he needs to and he’s actually a cool dude. Chauncey cool too but the rest of them are dickheads tbh. Cam was wilding and so was that other dude w the tiktok shirt on
"I ain't just gonna airball that" pov: goes back to check the shot. Yeah he airballed lol
Abraham Lincoln turning back the clock love to see it
This dude nick inspires me I think I’m gonna make a YouTube with my friends and play pick up out the gym and park
Aye bro this shit wild as hell yall some goats 🐐
Street ball in action 🏀
Dude scored a layup and yall ain change the score shouldve been 11-9 in game too
Real talk, Chris probably has the best FG% on the squad.
GOAT SHIT MAH BOI😈😈📈📈
Chris is so funny 🤣... Makes it so entertaining
9:58 bro got up court so fast so people would forget about that facial 😂😂😂
Nick briz the goat if I get that 💯
Gio ass 1-37 from mid court and then throws his hands up when he makes it. lmao
These vids so hard
Not gon lie video was a vibe good basketball no brawls 🤝
Nicks team stay counting extra buckets lmao
Pull up to seattle. Or somewhere on the west coast.
Yes sir savage squad!!!!
Nick and his team are the softest people I've ever seen
You already know who it is ya boy ohh.bucky tryna get tht $500😈 what’s good Nick come play my squad
Carlos gotta stop the trash talk gio taught him a lesson
That orange hair tik toker was like 2 for 20 and acted like he's the best shooter there😂 plus all his unnecessary dribbling did nothing😂
Cam is really good tho man
Nick briz whole squad 🤡🤡🤡
Abe Lincoln trash! Bring cam in to replace him
I hate Carlos' shot more than his personality.
Literally the worst basketball ever
BIG DUBS FOR THE GOATS 🙏💯💯💯
they always barely win against the sorriest competition, does anyone else see that?
yall da goat frfr no one wants the smoke 💯👀
Guy in white singlet tall as but clumsy AF
This that quality Carlos and the savage squad content im here for
Y’all hear the yrg in the back rage wya
Chauncy needs his own youtube channel.
You guys should play balls life on YouTube
I would be so mad to be On Gios team oh my goodness😭😭😭🤦🏽‍♂️
🔥🔥🔥savage squad up
Carlos and Iman really some goofies 😂😂
Cris was like😬😬😬 lol 13:49
Carlos just be talking trash for no reason 😭😭
Ball is life at 800k East squad. 900k West squad. East and West combined at 1Million?
Friga rematch plz nick
Camera man do a line of coke before the game? Can't record for shit
Respect to y'all!! Coming from Tuscaloosa Alabama. T-town rocking with y'all!! 💪💪💪💪🦾🦾🦾
Gio suck I’m sorry he’s the reason they lost 😂😂
Come To Memphis TN
2hypa game?
Gio made them lose
yo what happened to the 2k rematch?
Jesus Carlos is so bad. That's the kinds pass some random slow teenager will throw cuz he can't dribble head up and he's shook.  Then he threw up the blind man layup lol  This the 1st time I seen Abraham hit 2 shits in a game. Holy shit 3 3s?! He been in the lab
If the other team got rid of the dude with the wild dribbling and 3 point shots, they might have won the game.
What kills me about Gio is he is fucking quick, but he only uses it in one fucking spot. He scared to drive man he gotta drive some
Stop picking up lil asian dude spamming the studder step one leg 3s, half court shots lol
Nick's inner white boy is starting to present itself lol 8:48
Who tf idea was it to have Gio wise on the team like what is he shooting bra? Like wtf
Carlos needa get his ass beat no cap.
Slide to vero beach Florida south county park we shutting down all that💀💀
Carlos talked so much to have 0-0-0 and 2 turnovers
Screaming "im like that" to the camera of fans that watch you every week that.know for a FACT you are not "like that"
$Marcusnard21
All of them be so quick to say they didn’t foul when it’s clear they did but then complain about getting fouled on every shot don’t make sense
Carlos and Kris talk like they good lol
Gio shooting those mid court 3's while only being down 3 in a game to 13 would have me so heated
cam wilder to join the savage squad
There’s no people really play with gio him dribbling over 24 seconds everytime then throwing up a shot praying it goes in
Y’all need to pull up to south county park in vero beach so I can hush Carlos up
Best hopper ever!! Nick is a hopper hooper
Cam was violating😭🦶🏾
Whatever happened to the If you get 600k subscribers, you'll do a 2hype rematch?
Nah this game was actually fye 😈🔥
When he said you got 5 dollar jersey SHUt the fuck up i cried
Brizzy went crazy
Is it me or the nick briz squad is becoming annoying?
Ajwa

tiktokers are sooo luckyyy they hit every thing do all agree
chauncey is that dude
Carlos man you gotta take your time
Give me the $100! $JackGnagie love the vids!
Why tf does Abraham say all ball every time he arm wraps someone defense. Like bruh you aint a db.
Savage Squad the best on YouTube and hella entertaining
When’s that 2hype rematch
Carlos play making is 0
Where’s rematch 2hype???
I know y’all can’t do much about it, but the lighting in this vid kinda trash.  Great bball content tho 🔥. Savage squad the illest
Nick pushes off everytime he drives bruh
Savage Squad elite😵‍💫‼️
One day I’ll play against you Nick or your squad🔥🙏🏼
This the most I’ve seen Abraham score 😂 about damn time! And big W for the video not having Carlos acting all macho that shit be annoying
I’d be pissed if I was on Gios team…
lol, gio too heavy to carry
savage squad khabib always finds that camera 😂
You are crazy good
I know Gio Wise teammates were punching the air when they got the roster and saw they were on his team...
Carlos dressed like a 64 ovr rookie one
did no one noticed that they never changed the score in the second game when the guy in the white tank sauced up Chris. should of been 11-11 after cam drained that 3 on nick or did i miss something?
Gio just launches dumb shots lmao. Makes 1 of every 10. Don’t see how any of his teammates didn’t get frustrated playing with someone who plays that stupid.
That gio kid is so weak 😂 I’m confused why he is here
Damn Lincoln was ballin today cash may have nothing to hate on the man this video
Nick hand checked the whole game lol
carlos really just running back and fourth did he score once
Gio missed hella shots from half court and even from the three line and he makes 1 half court after trying so hard all game everyone goes crazy???? Hell nah he wasting scoring opportunities then again savage squad shutting them down but still
we need devin in the lab to cook yall would be an amazing game
“Fucking mini mouse” 8:34 😂😂😂😂😂
$beachbraden     Ily nick
Gio so ass don’t pull up anywhere with him your grandpa could beat gio
Need dat 100 nick , you got me ? $LilLaylow5
Nigga Hoopin FR

4999
Great energy, reminds me of AAU

friga bitched up. he should have maybe pushed u or something a bark at least. but staying quiet. maybe they scared of ur team / gang. but thats wat it is . the jungle. im happy for u kiddo. u got hops n heart.
Gio wise needs to shoot something closer than 60ft
We need the NYC TikTok crew with Cam Zeddy Beloti Zero and them vs Savage Squad. That would be a good game
Nick going stupid boa
What about the 2hype rematch ??????
I don’t remember carlos scoring but he said bro wasn’t scoring
Another banger! Savage Squad!
🤦🏾‍♂️ calling fouls on shots that aren't fouls and then complain when they call a foul on you that you actually foul on? 😂😂🤔 Damn bro this is the first sus game I watched
YESSIR GREAT VIDEO!
Nick was getting scored on nasty 🤢
Carlos screaming like he put work in 😂😂 comedy
Y’all nice with it tho 👌 cant wait for that September game thoooo
Replace Carlos man he’s annoying and getting 0 points just talking trash to get clout he’s a bum
I’m pretty sure nicks gonna bring the energy…am I right
Been waiting all week , worth the wait
Carlos and other dude need to quit talking. They don’t do Anything 🤣🤣
14:34 they got cheated a bucket.
🔥🔥
Stand by it why tf is Abraham in this shit
Yeah Carlos is sped fersure 😭
Bro he lied so much at 16:54 cause he shit then his arm got hit, that is still a airball lol.
Best YouTuber in the game
that ending was crazy
Once again Nicky and his princess or weak asf no 🧢🤣😂🤣😂
People who actually like/root for savage squad = no actual basketball IQ
Gio be doing all that dribbling for nothing lmao
when you realize carlos can’t dribble with his head up
Yesssssirrrrr!!
Abe Lincoln reminds of tony snell he don’t do shit
10:29 toughest play of the game for sure
😂😂😂
Abe Lincoln hits 2 threes  Also abe Lincoln I'm like that
Cam made nick his bitch this game😂😂
even tho they lost  it doesnt mean they cant hoop.
@JDub Customs bro you played against nick briz??
Let’s go nick
W
W
abe lincoln got his career high 6 points😯
Since nick briz team think they hard and shii play k showtime and his team
cash app? you ain’t got venmo or sum 😭
Then Yt hoopers soft irl 😂😂
Abraham stay fouling talking about “all ball” 😂
Is that gio kid being serious when he starts dribbling ??
This time Carlos got a Patrick McCaw ring😭 Lol still love for the video tho❤️
What happens to that tall Eruopen guy
nick congrats ur a famous star. showing people wat real streetball is. I love it u dont want to fight but so be it. Ur the real deal. n carlos is always funny
Can’t wait till y’all get our guy Travis back 🔥👌🏾
who’s the black dude in the black tik tok shirt he raw low key
Little man finally hitting swish nice
Crazy how cats from tik tok go 3-14 and think they nice and that’s just the shit u showed like u editin out misses and shit
The only people that actually like savage squad are the ones who are terrible at basketball but like theatrics. They can relate to savage squad because they are all equally trash at ball. (Crowd + savage squad < any actual basketball players)
Definitely not beating faze with that dude with the beard on yals squad.
Please answer me why the hell is Carlos on the team?!?! That man makes one basket every other game!
Carlos gotta watch his mouth saying the N word
My boy nick said “👶🏼🍽”  😂😂😂
BOY LEME GET NEXT GAME
What happen vs 2hypeV
So everyone there were 99 shot creators😂
Game was trash event with out the fouling
I can't fw Lincoln man... He just talks too much, without doing much😂
I would hate to play with gio when he's just shooting half court shots like bruh ur not that guy
Carlos looking like he got casts on both of his legs with the way he guards and looks 🤣
Nick literally does nothing every week, he sucks and gets carried in the videos. he only noticed bc he runs the channel, trust me if chauncey ran it, they would be more famous.
Nick briz has taught me to become more like a savage on the court and not really give a fuck and just hoop out on anybody 👍🏽
Nick squad honestly suck😭
How does the worst player on the court have the biggest mouth of them all?
Aye yo get that man cam to the savage squad
Vanfleet was hitting
i remember when nick briz used to do them lebron impersonations 🤞🏽$DenverLUVV
W vid💚
Best basketball channel hands down!
that man Carlos SPED fr
yuuurrrrrrrr, play fans 1v1 !!!!
U said at 600k too that there'd be a rematch with 2 Hype tho, we made it happed so where's that
Kris He stiff armed me when that’s all nick does and then calls foul lol
Has anybody noticed how good Chauncey is when he has the green shorts
🗣🗣🗣
I love watching y’all but the most annoying shit is the dude with the beard and chris one dude doesn’t do shit the whole game but will run his mouth the other has something to say about every little thing like bro just play ball
bro real life said all ball when he was huggin LMAO
Fire Video tho
Sheeesh
Can’t wait to see y’all dominate another team
Gio lost them the game
This a banger! Cash gonna pay some bills with this one! 😈
SAVAGE SQUAD UP
Nick starts getting mad the moment he ain’t the superstar lmao
Red head band guy surely talks a lot of trash for a bum.
Imagine being on Geo's team and he throws up air balls without passing every possession.
One of these guys is gonna get their a$$ kicked eventually with that energy.
14:21 no point for that ?? He scored
All geo does is shoot desperation shots, he’s trash asf 😂 only thing he can do is dribble but looks goofy asf lmao
Who don’t want to fight y’all
Yo nick u fouling the shit out of cam no bull
I know Carlos isn't the first to be talking about not scoring at 17:39
Why keep playing with Carlos if all you do is yell at him like that. Shit is weird.
Have that same energy in real hoods 😂😂😂😭😭😭
Yessir
Mannn imagine if cam teamed up with you guys that’s a scary look.
The best games so far of the savage squad!  That Cam guy is an excellent shooter with very nice form, does anyone have his channel ?
what happened to you rematch against 2hype when you reach 600k
Man it’s crazy since that first fight happened, everybody wana fight 🤣🤣
The big boy Chris getting better and better… that man is dedicated… Word 💯
Best team on YouTube
Savage squad probably the worst put together YouTube ball squad ever lmao. They all are pretty trash, play terrible defense (they foul every time on every play), and have the worst trash talking. Carlos might be the worst player ever to call themself a hooper. Briz is the only half decent player on the team, if he wasn’t as athletic as he was he would be straight up terrible. All they do is scream non coherent/irrelevant shit. Oh and the big dude on their squad is absolute garbage! I can’t believe people actually hype them up/enjoy watching them. Lowest quality of basketball on YouTube. I wish they would play the ballislife squad, they might not even score (if BIL were to play full effort defense)
LOL that guy with the crazy blonde hair literally does normal moves at normal speed, but stutter steps a fuck ton. 😂
How come nobody has taught Carlos how to play competent defense? I want to play him 1 v 1 for $1,000.
Savage Squad Has one of the nicest chemistry
Nobody payed attention to the score ? They didn't give them the point when the scored the lay up. It should've been 11 instead of 10 on that shot.
Who let this clown Gio wise believe he’s a deep 3 shooter. With that form especially. Games might’ve been closer if they let cam get more shots up 🤦🏼‍♂️
Carlos is horrible 😂😂😂😂
Love your videos bro y’all undefeated 🔥
I never seen beard guy make a bucket😂😂
GOAT NEVER DISAPPOINTS WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT
17:06 "i aint just  gonna air ball like that, yo mans hit my arm thats a foul" man got fouled after the shot.. 😂
Come to Texas y’all get y’all ass beat
Nick keep up all the hard work brotha!! Make them put that respect son!!! 🔥 🔥
Bruh get rid of carlos and get Cam
Chris a beast ya
LMAOO FAZE really needs bronny to beat savage squad
Y’all should play one of the ball is life squads
Chauncey ain't no joke we had to learn that the gard way 💪😏
best one to do this $eriklopez4647
I can already hear Cash “Alright Abraham” 🤣🤣
Gio selling🗑🤦🏾‍♂️ definitely would’ve got benched on my squad
Carlos watch how you talk to people bro
😂 Chauncey said, “I’ll brake yo jaw on yo mama.” That shii was funny
Damn Carlos actually met his equal in that kid that dribbles through his legs excessively and then launches a crazy prayer shot
Y’all getting thrashed September 25th😂
AYYYYEEEE!!!!! $MGiftedhands KEEP GRINDING 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lmao you guys were fouling the shit outta them 🤣
I feel like they pay Chauncey more now so that he will talk trash LOL
Lfg briz
Savage squad y’all be hacking like crazy but call every foul smh y’all be hooping  tho
tiktok team just chucks halfcourts n calls it a day 😭
Gios not a fast dribbler, hes a damn spazz. Goes no where and literally chucks the ball up near halfcourt
🏀 ❤️
Okay but why is Cam and Gio on the same team I thought they had beef 👀
Y’all can’t just ball why y’all gotta get in the face?
Your so dirty Nick instead of telling your teammates to play defense you tell them to foul.........weak bro🖕
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goat
Y’all got real heated at that park especially Chauncey
Just bc theres no refs doesnt mean yall gotta foul every play 😂😂
Matthew 6:26 King James Version 26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?(Trust in God even in the hard times).
Abe finally came tf through and lechun James definitely did this thing oh and Juan Carlos trash 🗑😂
Aye cam show up every time he play them and nick was locking up I’m convinced cam just a baller that guy solidified his self cause them was hard shots bra was just  hitting them though
Abraham Lincoln showing off his skill today
wheres the 2hype game bruh?
carlos scores 0 but managed to talk the most shit
Y’all gotta respect savage squad y’all under rate this team but look what what they do..Greatness lol
cant wait til you guys play Faze clan and if young king Bronny is pullin up. litlitlitttt
Homie Abraham knocked down some 3s and played good defense ! have to give him the props he deserved !
Does Carlos have some of that snow white before the games or what?
Ong if gio didnt shoot everytime there could have been some dubs from the tiktokers
The guy gaurding Chris has baby face no cap
Savage Squad goin crazier every video lets goo
Gio shot iq is in the clouds😂🤣😂
That one nigga swears he doing something with his dribble moves and then just jacks up a 3😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
kick Carlos out of the team, I don't understand what he's doing playing with you despite being funny because he says and does things that don't make sense hahaha
17:16 “all ball” and your arms are wrapped around him 😏
Carlos still ass asf🤣🤣‼️ and bout time iman didn’t play like ass this time 🤷🏽‍♂️
HAHAHAHA savage squad is goated
Broooo the nigga Carlos ain’t get a bucket n was the loudest on the court I’m hella weak😂😂😂 that boy so doo doo😂😂😂 but the rest of y’all did y’all thang💯💯💯

Fire content like always
Abe be talking the most 😂😂 n be fouling the whole Time y’all need a replacement for him n Carlos
Ngl Nick and Carlos were getting cooked in their matchups 😂🤣
Gotta love it when Chauncey hits them. He was on fire! Shout-out to iman too, respect his name!
Gio wise FG: 2/20 😂😂😂

Blonde light skin dude suck. All he does is dribble fast in place and take (and miss) step back 30 footers
Yo love the vids always looking forward to them every week keep grinding 😈💪🏽
Them TikTokers did all that  unnecessary dribbling
Carlos is talking mad shit but can’t even get the ball and make a shot LMFAO 😂
$Jmanzz777 always loved yo videos shit entertaining 🙏🏾 bless up
Carlos needa stop talkin when he ain’t doin nothin in either of the games  I need y’all to play Ballislife east coast squad  Now that’s better content than playing tiktokers or some random guys who just tryna fight or talkin trash cause nothin interesting happening in the game
Hi yourrage
😂carlos be talking mad crap boi score nothing haha
Chris fouls everyone and he calls a foul evertime he misses
One thing about savage squad is, everyone knows their role and they have amazing chemistry. You can’t just throw guys together and beat them even if your team has more talent.
Need that cashapp😭
Kshowtime could easily beat your team bro 😂 your team ain’t that good
All these games be funny as hell or just straight toxic but it’s just amazing content all together 💯😂
10:48  Emon scores
Team up with Cam and play Kshowtime
13:00 minutes in and Carlos is the weakest link on the team by far kid has no mechanics and moves like a robot AKA slow motion throws up prayers for a shot and has no defense has to foul just about every time…
I swear gio wise be dribble dribble dribble in the same spot shoot, boy doesnt go anywhere with it hahahah
Carlos stepped up his game now Abe Lincoln is the new Carlos in the comments 😂
Nick send a 100 so I can get some smoke $ernadkevro like this so he can see

Gio was throwing up stupid shots
15:20 this shot literally made me jump out of where I’m sitting
Where my free 100 at 😂😂
17:15 LMAOOO savage squads defence summed up in one possession
Abraham is not really like that .. He’s probably worst then Carlos lol
Nick is the goat as a player also when it comes to recruiting players too Savage squad is lit af🔥
Aye nick btw it’s my birthday today and my dad gave me $100 if you could send it it would really make my Birthday 100x better also love the video 😊🙏🏾.
They mightve had a better chance if gio would stop taking those dumbass shots he sold

Great game man. Team TikTok put on a better performance than 2hype did.  And why is Gio taking so many deep 3s? Like TikTokkers had a chance to get the dub had Gio not try to iso Carlos so much.

Iman has to have the most unlikeable personality ever. Good on him tho, he’s now 4-56 in the past 5 videos
Gio took some dumb shots lol
Cam Wilder's range >>Carlos' Willy size lmao
This dude nick really went from nothing to something real hustle
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins, Repent of what the New Testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel obey the teachings of Jesus documented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, be baptized if you have faith in Jesus then you will live life with him as your example. If you need prayer i'll pray for you. If you want to keep contact with a brother in Christ i’ll keep contact with you. The love of God is beyond our understanding. God bless..

10:05 that late ass call.
Well rounded game for nick and his team
The LeBron beard guy finally made 2 more buckets than I'd previously seen him 🥶
Anyone else find this video hard to view?  It's like a 3d movie but without the special glasses.  They need a new cameraman or new equipment.
😈🖤
Fire video nickk new wave 🤘🏼💧
This is some of the worst basketball I’ve watched in a long time
Nick love you man
OCKYYYYYYYYY
Yessir
Faze might destroy the savage squad
Iman had a career game love to see it
It was a tuff game cam but u show them that u tuff
Yo nick defense got humiliated😭
$robertjackson07
L vid niggas being toxic for wat jus play the game especially Carlos dropped zero doing the most
You should run wit cam next video
Aint no way people think Gio is actually good right?
Savage squad going stupid 😈😈
that little arab dude got little man syndrome
This was fire nick!
Goat
Good shit. Y'all should pick ME up. We grow 'em tougher in Alaska.
WE LOVE CARLOS
Entertaining. But needs less crying from Nick 😂
Savage Squad The real deal especially with Iman shooting green jumpers
Vid was entertaining asf no cap. Carlos really talkin bout shot selection to Cam when he was balling out the second game and carlos aint score none the entire video
I was the first comment, the cameras just wasn’t on
Savage squad hand checks and hacks whole game saying “good D” or “all ball”
Good shit Nick but tell yo boy Carlos to skore tha damn ball and stop all det talkin. He got Abraham lookin like he good
all ball? he was literally huggin bro 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Carlos is special Ed bro I swear get him off the court
What happened to the 2HYPE matchup?
Faze can’t even play ball lol
@nick briz by far my favorite youtuber!!! Favorite basketball squad out there! I get more hyped for these videos than any other youtuber out there
Beard dude and Carlos need to just get benched for life they ass
Man, you’re a killer 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
From Aus🇦🇺🇦🇺
These is soo damm good 🍿🍿🍿
I’m not gone cap he pull up in yo shit
22-0👀
Nick: "I was out getting plastered the night before" Translation: I was snorting all of the coke
really pathetic all talk no action. All them been shown to be pathetic. Y’all just watch cause the shit talk. One of these days it’s not gonna be too good for them. 1. Carlos slaps someone…runs away 2. Nick watches a friend get hit in the head with a bottle…nothing happens 3. Chris gets in it with a dude who is way smaller…doesn’t go in for the kill. Pathetic. You talk you back it up. None of that has ever been shown.
Y’all do a lot of trash talking man, it’s entertaining but also dangerous
Nigga said a 5 dollar Jersey 😭😭
lets go nick!!
Handing out Ls
savage squad vs faze cant wait
Gio shot selection hurts to watch!
Abe said that’s all ball….that’s lock
Yo
Yo
W vid love you nick
Aye this was fire
lol these florida people r geting like new yorkers mad agresive
Chris is a hell of a big man
Nicks 3 point shot gives me Joe Ingles vibes 🔥🔥🔥
Another great vid Nick!
"ON YO MAMA" gotta be a t-shirt brooooooo
Damm these are good games but it is wat it is💯💯
Love the energy y’all bring
3:18 they going home early no thanks to you as usual. You should go ahead and retire already bruh
Abraham Lincoln is not like dat cuz I’m pretty sure dats tha same nigga dat got hit w/ ah beer can n ain’t do shit homies😭
Aye can someone answer this question for me? Why doesn't chris dunk?
Man is a air ball machine
Nick always brings the energy 🔥
Nick the 🐐 i love your videos bro they so entertaining and ima keep watching 🔥
Chancey is Kawhi Leonard. Nick is Jordan on the wizards. Abe Lincoln is Jae crowder. Carlos is imon shumpert and Chris is prime Damarcus cousins
Bro I love watching these vids makes me want to start hooping again.
Bro Nick really not good he okay at done but no handles but still fun to watch how
Nick with the best runs 🔥
Your videos stop me from killing my self thanks man
Abe Lincoln with his first points ever screaming “I’m like that” like he carries the team every week LMAO
I been watching since 100k  All love tho no hate I wanna see you make it further in this yT shit
Y’all are saving YouTube at the moment
W fucking vid bro🔥
Ofc Carlos talking shit and scored 0 lmfaoo
Chris plays bully ball but complains that he gets fouled he soft
kid with the yellow hair is horrible!! looks like this is his first time he played ball after studying Steph curry! he skipped the fundamentals
Beard man feeling himself way to much
@cam wilder you will not regret it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Savage squad all day 🔥👺
Good video bro and gio   needs to stop playing basketball all he was doing is throwing shots doing the same shit like dam   that one dude  was good
10:24 Thought he said pedophile 😂
3:33 looked like homie was playing 2k 😂
Goats
Ignorance really is bliss I guess.  Almost everyone playing here is absolute garbage but they don’t know it and have sky high confidence
Love the vids keep it up! Ain’t no other YouTube hoopers like y’all!!
baby food, no fr but cam crazy
W video neva miss
ion care what no one say this dude nick is a beast🔥
Cam owns nick no 🧢
I love how the two little guys talk the most shit and can never back it up!  Good playing Nick Chris and Chauncy
Yooo pick me! Under 5k commented and thumbs up every single video!! @forged.pg
Bronny better call all them fouls
Gio is trash. Why does he not pass the ball
WWWWWW
How the big dude gonna talk shit about how strong he is than complain about a stiff arm from a weak ass dude LUL
SAVAGE SQUAD 👀👀
finally abraham made more than 0 buckets this video😂😂😂
i respect Cam soooo much bro… he shows up, does his thing, doesn’t bad mouth anybody, and is hella respectful and humble. 💯
Camwilder in the savage squad??
Nick big fan but haven’t seen your game develop at all. Transition buckets only. No mid range no half court offense need to see you work on your game and stop tryna be a tik tok fighter
Can’t wait for cash to react to this
Less trash talking. You do what you do. Don't have to be dicks about it. Let your actions speak. People respect work. Be humble. This "fight " thing every video is clearly for views. Cut it out.
17:40 😂
No YouTube basketball Channel can match the entertainment that nick and his squad brings 🔥🔥🔥🙏🏼
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn Nick Had a flop game Chauncey and Chris did they thing
Idk if it’s just me but who else saw that vid where The TikTok squad won a game. Yeah they best of 3 but the win streak isn’t there no more. Still Respect🙏🏽
Carlos was a waking L 🤣🤣 the beard was a splash brother
can a team just come an clown these bums already??? what a joke of a team nick bricks and his pawns 🤣
Serious games they never pass to Carlos or Abraham lol
Nick And Carlos nice 👍 🔥
I wanna see one game of y’all just being some humble civilized humans. You can still be savage squad and talk shit but y’all od’ing and it’s a lot of ear rape
Y’all need to come to Detroit to ball I’ll have Chris looking like a baby
There’s 2 points y’all didn’t count in the second game, the basket shot in nicks face and the one made at at rim on chris
Carlos don’t even say sentences he just open his mouth and start rambling random shit lmao 💀
Why Carlos making fun of how dude looks? Has this crackhead not looked in the mirror lately?
the tiktok guy with the light ass hair squeaks his feet then throws it 40 ft from the basket straight in the air thinking it’s gonna go in..
I see you nick!!! Bless ya boy with that $100 fuck it❤️
9:53 dawg my mans with that stepback middie. Now that was nasty 😳
may i plz hv the $100, u see my usertag i need it to buy a treadmill. plz dawg ily ur vids
The thing you got to respect about nick is he makes the right plays and passes to open teammates who hit the 3.
Gio could be nice if he played more serious and smarter 😭
Nick: LeBron  Chauncey: Dame Carlos: old shaq but can shoot Carlos: Danny Green Abraham Lincon: Kyle Kuzma
Carlos said “ima ape nigga” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Savage squad really demons
bruh did carlos even score like wtf
Chris is a cry baby too lol
And I see why people still hate Gio 😂😂
not being salty nick deserved the w 100% , but gio wise sold with his nba range shots smh
Heavenly Father I pray you keep the person that’s reading this alive, safe, healthy and financially blessed. Amen💚
Cam wilder different🥶
Nick really the goat🐐🐐🐐
For once Carlos isn’t the worst player out there, this blonde kid taking half court shots took it
The dude with the buffalo hide on his head, the one who dribbles in place like Julian Newman and shoots a two-handed jumper like LaMelo is everything wrong with basketball. How could his teammates not kill him for the way he plays?  Dude got my blood boiling and I'm just watching him on YT, can't imagine playing with that clown.
Ngl nick briz is entertaining ash 😭😭
Savage Squad needs a nike deal, black air forces for all of them😂😈
Videos getting worse and worse ever since the “fight” video 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Abraham Lincoln in there like he really nice he barely scores lmaooo
5:36 I really hate when crowds start freaking out like that when the dude is over dribbling and creates like no separation
Bro vids always a banger man I Fw yo channel bro frfr💯
Yo nick pls take Carlos to a counselor I think he’s special Ed like fr
Come to NC
i respect you for not just showing y’all highlights respect ✊🏽.
Always 🔥 runs

Da Arab wit da beard be wishin he was black😭😭😭
Pull up to oneco pride park y’all gonna catch your 1st L
Nc will crush that win streak
Is this basketball or do you wanna fight? Play ball, talk basketball trash. Your making basketball silly.
Nicks whole team cry about fouls and that all I see from them 😂
gio is a fucking clown but him throwing the ball at carlos was funny i wish he did it to him more
Should’ve replace gio with the best shooter on TikTok Braxton then game would’ve been different
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Why Carlos talk all this shit like he nice. He had as much points as I did and I ain’t even play 😂
12:51 this nigga Carlos ain’t even look at the rim💀
Dam I wish I was there
Nick always posting fire 🔥 content
Nick I love your videos bro
1. Nick got mad at Chauncey cause Chauncey was sitting in the corner so he could hit a three but nick made a dumb mistake by trying to throw him an alley oop even though he was in the corner for an option so nick blamed him for not cutting but it was his fault so next time own up to your mistakes  2. Jdub made a good defensive play and Chris calls a foul cause he doesn’t wanna be seen as soft but in reality there was no foul so that call was just dumb now I’m not a tough guy myself but I’ve never claimed to be one either so if Chris is gonna be tough guy then don’t call a foul when it was just good defense  3. Ryan was going crazy and when y’all noticed that y’all started hacking him 😐 like cmon man you’re really just gonna hack him the whole game? And Abraham Lincoln wants to say it’s all ball the whole time when you can clearly see he’s hugging him every time. Pathetic   But a win is a win so if y’all are fine with whatever y’all did to get that win then props to y’all and congratulations I just wanted to point out a few things that were just crazy to me. But again congratulations on y’all’s win hope y’all are happy
Leggooo savage squad turnt

7:12 this the same dude  that was on ballislife, the guy who tried to fight nick “we don’t give af about basketball like that.” Now he is here.
World star basketball baby!🤘 Seriously tho, great Defence by Nick
He still trash
First
where is the 2hype rematch?
Chris every 5 seconds: “FUCK IS THEY TALKIN ABOUT!?”  Me:  “Who is talkin about what??”
Chauncey for President
Can’t believe the day has finally came where cam and gio on the same team again
Can Abe Lincoln plz do something for once

That spin cycle by Chris was nice
Abe really be 0-40 on his last shots lol
Damn the upload late for me but Ima still watch it though 💪🏼🔥🔥

Finally
Where’s savage squad vs 2 hype
Did I hear YRG in the building? @yourrage???

You guys can say whatever you want about the SavageSquad, but are you not entertained? 😂🔥
i might need to retire from playing the savage squad.. that’s 2 L’s 😭
4:24 YRG YURRR
What’s up nick
Man you really have te get rid of Abraham Lincoln , he can’t do nothing lol
SOMEONE CALL CASH NOW
I like how Chauncey doesn’t just start fights but will definitely check you after being disrespectful
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You can hate and dislike, Nick but are you not entertained? 😂🔥
This a fight or a hoops channel?
Dude Chauncey is such a good defender
🔥
Nick can shoot, dribble, drive to the rim, step back, post game nasty, his team leadership skills (he talks to his team so nice and NEVER undermines them( *sarcasm* )...& with that being said he honestly has the ability and potential to be an average basketball player.
The consistency is crazy🔥
Tuff
