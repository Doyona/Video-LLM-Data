This is what its all about. This is how it all started. Just rolling the camera. Who's with me?
Well looks like ur growing Sunday dinner

This was a great vlog

whoever is reading this, GET RIGHT WITH GOD! GOD IS SO AMAZING! TRUST GOD! HAVE FAITH! GOD BLESS!
Chicks are adorable they look so cute.
I LOVE THE BABY CHICKENS SO CUTEEEE
These types of videos are entertaining
I love these kinds of videos opposed to the “entertaining” ones, I just prefer them. They inspire me! I’m definitely in the “grind” part of my life right now, as a college student while raising my son. Keep going!
I have 24 chickens and 16 ducks and 2 turkeys u should try ducks there eggs r really good
Wow! Where did u guys get the baby tripod jumper? I want to get that for my twin granddaughters! 🤗
I watch these because I feel like I'm not part of the family if I don't..  I treat it like a religious sacrament. Smiling and positivity is my only religion atm
I love the “inspiring” AND the “entertaining” vlogs. I’m in it for the long haul. Joined July 2015 ❤️
love watching the ends guys keep doing them too never let the people at the start affect the end result. love you, your beautiful, your one of a kind, smile more!!!
New intro song who dis
The fact that there are ppl that make a big deal about what ppl do with THEIR life.. and their social media is pathetic. Doin what you're doin is what vlogs are about. Just glad to see you guys are safe & doin good :)
I have a rock Tumblr
Stop faking stuff.
I'v got laughting chicken from Indonesia 👍
I prefer these kinds of videos over the planned out entertainment ones! I love anything y’all post but really love the reality vlogs vs planned out vlogs!
I don't have any more they all died
The sun 🌞

Just as you are evolving… your viewers are growing with you. Weeee gettin old! Hate to say it, but we really are becoming ole’ folks 🥰… We love y’all… and we appreciate that our families can grow, endure challenges and loss, and evolve together… Love and peace to you all ❤️ -from your neighbors in Indiana ❤️
Pick up the camera and show your life THATS what we are here for

Need to fight your demons Roman
The baby is so cute
Omg i had a rock tumbler growing up it was noisy
It is very entertaining and enjoyable
Regardless Roman, your vlogs are awesome. The fact that you let us in to your life is good enough for me. Keep them coming brother and thank you.
Do you still have the P.O. Box? Would love to send something.
Hey mate I just wanted to tell you you’re amazing and whatever video you make it will be entertaining it will be inspiring it will be anything you want it to be because you’re amazing Mate and I wanted to tell you this because I grew up watching you and I’ve loved every single bit of it
That “are we not gonna tell ‘em” ending was NOT NICE! 😒😆
What happened to the “tanked” aquarium???
We have chickens, 8 of ours just got eaten 😕 my girls were so devastated. They raised them as chicks, so I totally get it.
roman cause of your nature and how you as a person had help me getting a lot of online friends on twtich that i thought i never would have. Its all cause of make ppl smile and open them into my life  with open arms . and im about the same age as u and still learning and get inspired by you. i wanna say thx for your family and u for share a part of your life keep being u.
Just me or where is his birthday Vlog?
what a cliff hanger. hahaha
Hopefully you’re vaccinated
You and your family are literally my goal in life, your videos have I spired me so much for what I want to be, that's why I watch your videos!
Dude you're the best. I'm watching you from Brazil. Keep it up!
real life minecraft, haha
Just filming your everyday life, is entertaining
Like shopping for ice cream so many flavours🤣
Keep these up Roman. I love following @offtheranch & @thesmiths because they aren't planned...they just go with it. It is great.
I don't support anything with the rainbow on it so I say any of the other 3 hats are winners for me!
I like your vlogs better when I see your day and what you do every day. I dont really like those entertaining videos when you do stunts and stuff xd
I think 20 minutes is to long for one video I lose my attention spans way to fast
Don't even need to try bro. It's pretty entertaining to me!
We have a bunch of chickens and one little rooster ☺️☺️ We got the first flock at 6 weeks the second set we got at 3 days boy it’s a jobbbb! But a very rewarding one! We are about at the point of introducing the two flocks and that’s a whole new mission!  💙-Fellow “chicken-tender” 😉
No more Smile More name?
Entertainment is being nosey, watching what y’all are up to!!!
Always love watching anything you do. No worries 🤗❤️
Cuz.. this was more than entertaining to me. It was all the inspiration needed. Just watching and seeing how happy you are with your family and seeing yall recovering from the awful past few years is exactly what I needed to see before I got my day started. I know this video is a few months old but thank you for showing us just a day with happiness.  I wish the best for you and your family and the rest of the world!
Your uplifting messages are entertaining.
Does anybody know what happened to flash
DUDE WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG FOR NEXT VIDEO IT USED TO BE EVERY DAY CMON MAN
i have 9 chickens and 3 ducks they are the best! but also a mess!😂 we raised them as chicks too they are still only 2 months old so no eggs yet but i’m excited!!
I do
Just watching any videos with you and your family is inspiring. Seeing how far you guys have come is amazing!!! I love you guys
We love it regardless what u do u and ur family are so amazing
look how big the kids are getting!! i am so glad you all are doing good Roman!! I need an iphone 12PM case!
I remember watching these when his son wasn't even talking and no daughter yet. And now his daughter speaks some words. That's how much i've ignored atwood vlogs over the years. Time flies.
love to the family.
I love the sun shine one!
"Are we not gonna tell them about, what?"
I like living in your normal day so I do find that entertaining you should vlog more :))
At 9:08 why did roman get so serious?
I love the fact that he is so genuine
this is the old roman I used to love to watch the real roman and not an actor roman! keep this up
i love just watching what you do especially your guys life it’s really cool !
we have chickens
I haven't been watching because I haven't gotten any notifications. I have the bell set to all. I'll turn off and reset but I want to watch anything you wanna put out
Be thankful that you can do what you can to provide food your family and be set for life
What happened to maw maw?! You better give her hugs for me!
^You could put that in your room ^ 😂😭😭
Where is the husky :(
Where’s flash?
I raised baby ducks from a couple of days old. It was the best ever until they made nests in my neighbors landscaping. But if you like chicken eggs you will love duck and ghs
I have 6 ducks and 2 Turkeys and I’m incubating 3 eggs
😁❤️
Can I see more pranks
I really enjoy seeing you guys just do whatever you do 😍 Seeing the everyday life is inspiring
Love the raw stuff and love the movie stuff - anything you produce always inspires me and always entertains me, and it’s always comforted me in making me feel better xx
It’s still entertaining your family makes me want to be American
It’s called growing up right. Keep them videos coming!!
find your dreams come true
i want a hat
Love every vlog😍
i would say do what makes your heart feel good..i enjoy any video you show..thx for sharing..👍
I love your vlogs and no matter what  you do I'll watch
.the rainbow
No need to apologize you're amazing I'm just happy you're back
7 years strong 💪🏻
you never need to apologise for that. if you wanna be relaxed and jist do raw vlogs tjats fine <3
I'm almost on my 6th year with y'all. Love y'all!! just want3d to say...i remember when Cora was younger I wanted to hear her cry but you always cut it off 😭
Where’s your guys Gtr
Definitely entertaining still :) Love a homely normal life vlog!
When she sed let's half more kids Roman be like o_o
Hey a raised feed and watered for the chicks. And put down a small 2x4. You won’t have to clean it out as much and they can hop on it and still get to it
Give your chickens cat food lol the nutrition makes them lay more eggs. It worked for ours. We went from 30 eggs a week to almost 50
Hey cool merch idea. Full camo hat that says "Your beautiful, your one of a kind, smile more." Because I want a camo hat but I also want one that has that saying.
Dont worry roman everything you do is perfect, what a great family x
You probably won’t see this but the chickens rub in the dirt as a “bath” to get the mites off!
I got hundreds of chickens at my store 😂 they’re literally the best pets ever
You should take a stop at my chicken feed store
Roman we never came to your videos for just entertainment most of us use your videos to put a smile on our faces  and a little joy to our days. You and your family are inspiring to watch either way. I’d rather see your everyday life just raising a family and enjoying life,lifting people up and brighting days than no videos at all❣️
Baby Knoxville
4:16 yea yea bro i know 😂🤣🤣
I just luv you guys. Nothing ever stays the same, so it's nice to be invited along on this next chapter of your lives. And you're right, it's all about family. GOD Bless You All.  Much Love Mad Respect
Drama.
For me this is entertaining and inspiring to me anyways
MawMaw said s#%T
Shut up hater Roman is the best youtuber
We don’t want entertainment we want what u do in your life that’s what makes you great
Been here since 2013. 24 years old and still a huge fan!
Are they gonna make cheese with goats?
We love you Roman and your ENTIRE family, we support and will always support you in anything you do. I hope you see this but if you don’t just know everyone supports you.
I prefer to just watch you in your daily life than the big 'entertaining' vlogs. It just feels so relatable. Love you guys x from Australia
The videos don't have to be entertaining for them to be good and have people watch them. Sometimes a good video we can just throw on and chill out is what we need. Can we have a video on an animal update? Like all the animals and pets you guys have and all the names because I get a bit forgetful with names hahah.
What is Pixie's baby's name? I forgot.
I personally find this inspiring because one day I wish to have a farm I would love for it!!
Those two chickens where taking dust baths they cleaneing there selfs
Honestly Roman, we love watching your family grow. Even if it's farm family. We love you guys!
9:07 his reaction when she said lets have more kids 😂😂😂
You have a big family and times have been tough on all keep doing you and continue to be an amazingly beautiful family!!!
I love watching your family vlogs, they are always entertaining no matter what your content is
In memory of Brooke and Lynn I miss  them terribly 😥🙄
Numerous 😀😀 X-ray   Going on
I🥰 u
9:17 i have isa brown chickens too and they do that pretty often. when they do that is kinda there bathtime, because they take sand baths
When you get new chicks you should dip their beaks in the water for a second. ;)
where are the GTRs lets see the rest of the family too? BRO and DAD?
I don’t care what a video is I will watch the video no matter what. Ur videos are so inspiring no mart the content
Any video you post is entertaining
Yup we’ve been with you all this time and we don’t like the Beverly Hillbillies aspect you’ve created. And those hats are atrocious bro. The art is good but get a higher quality hat for crying out loud.
“When things are getting hard, remember why you started.”
Plz vlog more it’s entertaining
Bro don’t worry u could be my fav vlog man I’ve been a big fan of you for many years.
Collab with Matt so we can see your new guns since your last shooting video.
We love you
Get goats they are fun
I kinda like this new direction your channel is going. You give us a glimpse into your everyday life that we’ve never seen before with entertainment on the side. I like the inspiration/entertainment direction you’re going to. Now, WHERES FLASH!?!?
You need a guard goose for your chickens.
LOVED THIS VLOG. GIVE US MORE OF THIS. ALWAYS WITH YOU ROMAN!
I like the sun hat the best
The little tiny chickens are sooo cute
I have chickens
Who loves Rural King? One of my favorite stores!
9:05 Killed me! I kept on repeating it to see Roman’s reaction.
Agates and rocks are my jam! We have hundreds! We are in Minnesota and you can find them near the rivers!
These are the wholesome, family and inspirational vlogs I'm here for. 💜
Inspirational and Uplifting!! That's what's needed these days.
I got chikons
🐓🐓
Roman everything you do daily is inspiring. We want to be where you are. With a loving family just thriving better than never ♥️much love from my family to yours
You are very inspiring, Roman. I strive to reach the point you’re at. God bless brother. Jesus is in love with you
Roman Atwood was never here to entertain. He made vlogs for his own family to watch over years later
I have chickens
hey bro, just by you posting whatever videos, that's just inspiration all in itself. keep it up man.
keep vlogging its inspiring
Melbourne -Australia... lockdown 4.0 🤣
We learned a lot today ! And for a city boy it's cool content ! Good job killer!
<3
Roman, you have always entertained us viewers. Years later you find yourself in-front of the lens expressing your feelings on how you don’t have that explosive entertaining passion anymore, and that you are here to spread positivity even if it is in short bursts.. One of the most motivating things to see while growing up watching your videos is the passion you had for what you love, you will always be entertaining without effort. You have put in the work, we all love you and your family. Just enjoy doing what you love and don’t think so hard about then vs now, just pick up that camera when you WANT to and I promise it will be entertaining to us all!
As you've grown, so have us OG followers. Im embarking on a family journey myself and watching you is definitely an inspiration to how i want to be with my family.
the begging brought me back in time to the pranks era.
Can we have a update on how your dad is doing?
Where is flash
Jesus loves you Roman repent and accept Jesus as your LORD and SAVIOR and stay away from sin and begin to trust Jesus you will then become a born again Christian and have true happiness
I love just seeing you vlog just chilling and hanging out  thats what every day family is all about. WE LOVE YA!!!!
Roman record urself sitting on the coach all day and it’s still entertaining
where’s FLASH???
You should get a white leghorn because in the 3 years we have had our white leghorn she has only missed about 7 days of eggs. Also you can buy fully grown chickens they are a bit more expensive but then you don't have to worry too much about them dying young and feeding them when they aren't laying
loving the positive smile more energy ❤️
Love all your videos keep being you! ♥️😍
I love just watching your day to day
We are already your fans. We feel like family and friends. Don’t put so much pressure on yourself. Just share your life with us. Your kids your animals property projects. It’s all good it’s all fun and we love it. You’re not gonna crash and burn don’t worry. We’re all ready here and we’re not going anywhere. Go easy and have fun
cora is such a beautiful girl with a beautiful smile just like her mom
I enjoy the daily activities vlogs more than when you plan content. But I’m 38 and a mom so maybe that’s why. Love you guys 😍😘😍
I love y'all "raw" an in movie style!! U make me smile more 😉
Love your videos. I’m used to a lot of people I watch on here not entertaining or inspiring. I just like to listen and y’alls faces
Prayers 🙏 for you
Anything you do is right! Loving the family vlogs!
What happened to Flash?
I like just to see your family and what you are all doing. It is inspiring.
It’s funny how all of his views used to be kids now were all grown up teens
Stop apologizing for the "mundane" vlogs. I loved your old style of videos but I much prefer the more relaxed day to day stuff. That's what people wanna see! To get to know you, it's way more personable
I could honestly watch you do farm vlogs every single day 😍 that is entertainment to me 😂
I do enjoy this just as much, because however i do enjoy the hectic pond jumping, it's nice to be able to watch someone chill with some chickens after a day of exams etc.
Where is Noah
Awe! Loved seeing the chickies @ the end.
Vlog anything. I would love to see animals while vloggging . Stop over worring
Roman anything you vlog is entertaining and inspiring I've been watch you since 2016 and I still love this channel
My family and I love the inspirational work you guys do the entertainment aspect is wonderful but we watch you guys because you put smiles on our faces and make us feel better about our lives even though we really don’t have much of anything at all right now watching you guys does inspire us to keep going Thank you so much!!

I feel like Roman is going through a spiritual awakening.  It’s okay to open up and Wanting to move on to something else.
Thanks for taking care of grandma. You are a true patriot! Love and many 🙏🙏
So I have chickens and they are crazy but when we go to pick them up the crouch down do they do that for you and what’s also crazy is we have an Afro chicken

Tell us about what... tell us about what!! 😂😂
Watching this family just makes me so happy!!💕
You always have been Inspirational, I guess that's where smile more came from... Sending love and vibes to your family x
When they are in the dirt they are dust bathing
Stop trying to sell hats an do something cool lol
You should just live with ur family and no camera. Best memories are made by the eyes not not a camera. Godbless
Just do you. You don’t have to try to entertain us. The video is entertaining no matter what. .
What happened to flash?
1st time watching...no nothing about y'all,  but I enjoyed this video, love country living, land, chickens, trucks!

TAKE A FAMILY ROAD TRIP TO A SLIP N' SLIDE
9:09 😂😂😂 it was legit the 😑
🅜🅐🅖🅘🅒🅐🅛🅛🅨  🅓🅞🅟🅔.... Find Me {{<<▪
I have been alergic for all my life sadly
Your family is always very inspiring in all that you do!!  Your "rocks" are actually raw crystals!! Im an avid collector & have a very extensive collection of crystals raw & polished! You have some nice stones in there to my friend, I noticed them when you showed them!
As a long time viewer, I would go with whatever content you guys are throwing out and I would support with the same amount of oozing love. Haahahhahah.
You did us diiiiiiirty at the end hahahaha!  Believe me, these types of vlogs is my definition of Roman Atwood's Entertaining Vlogs! I LOVE IT!
These are my favorite kind of vlogs
your head should be - less thinking -  more just be yourself... thats what we are here for anyways
I like the vlogs now too!
Makes sense...you made your millions no need for fans...focus on your family now I guess thanks to us for wasting our time making you rich. On to the next. Us fans need to be smarter. Instead of making these "youtubers" famous and rich we need to get our selves there and stop making these people rich!
❤️❤️❤️ So glad your doing better ❤️❤️❤️
Just seeing ya Fam is always good to see, love the hats! Happy to see the donkeys too!
The reds lay every 26 hours i used to work on a chicken farm
Chickens are ao fun! We have them and its so fun and educational.
Love the uplifting!!! Maybe entertainment once in awhile. The vlogs you have posted are awesome!
I just hatched 16 eggs and only two survived
u guys should still wear masks unless vaccinated but that gives an excuse for others to not wear a mask bc they can easily lie...masks should stay
Your shocking
Shit asf
You ever get a chance to pick up some Lavender chicks/chickens , I would highly suggest them ,,  beautiful chickens , unique in color ... just a suggestion
I have 51 chickens and 16 cows 2 dogs and 7 cats
I love this focus so much more!  It’s so inspiring and please bring us into his journey everyday again! I would love seeing y’all’s family grow and take care of your animals it’s something to inspire me to work hard everyday so I can get to that.  That’s always been the life I want a family and farm and y’all don’t do exactly that but your doing what you love
Your everyday life is entertaining !!!!!!
I love these videos! Seeing the fam and seeing what you guys do!
Even when you are doing family stuff it is entertaining.
I think a way to inspire a lot of people is to entertain them
Knox is huge
your goal doesnt need to entertain! this was entertaining and inspiring! :))
happy birthday, Roman
WHAT DIDNT YOU TELL US? CLIFF HANGER AT THE END
Where is flash
I love the every day to day vlogs brings me so much joy and peace ❤️
we love all the content you’re pushing out but remember don’t overwork yourself and if you ever need a break, take one and you don’t need to apologize for it💛
I miss flash
you’re always entertaining and uplifting  me when you’re uploading! you work so hard, we should all appreciate anything you do:)
romen thing you're on the right path. keep doing what you're doing man
You should still wear your mask especially if your not vaccinated
having another baby???
I love your vlogs. Thanks for the updates. Cute new chickens and awesome rock tumbler. Can't wait to see them when they're done.
I always find these vlogs entertaining. I love seeing the family life and i guess the farm life now haha
Br I remember when cora had just been born she is getting so big I will always watch your vlogs
And vlog whatever floats your boat
Sweet I have chickens I have some Easter eggers they lay blue or green eggs good luck with em
I have 15 female lambs and one male and a rooster an two teenage chickens love it going to get a few  turkeys soon love taking care of animals 🥰
The more content the better
I have chickens
Umm I like sunshin
Are you all vaccinated
I love the family vlogs, no extra entertaining. This right here, this vlog was so entertaining to me. I love watching all of your videos, i feel like im watching family videos. I love this
I recently hatched them with a homemade cardboard incubator!!
My sister-in-laws dad got some chickens And they Get some fresh eggs every once in a while
No fair we need to wear masks
Nahhh you are a narcissist
My dog just passed away today. and your videos just help raise my spirits up a little more. thank you for that. keep doing what you are doing.
We have chickens. We even have the ISA browns. They give us the biggest brown eggs. We love them
I actually find this very entertaining then the  big surprises/events stuff. I love this content.
Inspiring is only genuine if you're practising what you're preaching, holding no grudges and forgiving always. Being thankful to your followers for the life they've Afforded You. Hollywood is dying because they're preaching when they are so far removed from the struggle of the normal people. Family vlogs , in their most honest form, is what people want, not being preached at.
I dont even know who you are
0:21 is this Bioshock?
Do a outside/house tour
Wow 🤣🤣🤣
You could put your rings in the tumbler to give them a shine
You have inspired me to start sharing my gaming on twitch and even pick up a new digital  camera to share things some what through my eyes See I have PTSD with anxiety.  plus I am a 21yr Veteran firefighter.  To be honest I usually see what can go wrong or the Darkness lerking in a situation before I see beauty in it.
Country life is the best!
Youre incredibly lucky to have such a beautiful family.
i like the sun alot
i cant watch video its a whole blaxk screen
Probably won't see this  ose, your veggies need  nitrogen, and super thrive couldn't hurt.
No disrespect, but what the heck am I missing?
I am so curious about what brit said that you won't tell us! Lol
been had chickens for 4 years now
lmao roman get fucked bro u must be going low on money
U. Family man u don't have to apologize do u n raise ya kids
Can you do one movie every month
How do you know that they’re all girls
Wheres your dad
Love watching your videos they make me smile everytime smile more
Been watching for years! Love you guys and I'm just happy to see any video you wanna post 💕
I love the content. Just do what you do best... being you. The real ones will stay close, we are a strong army with y’all!
I'm a chicken guy
i have been so spotty on my channel. it's crazy. i had my spotty moment a while back and just kinda had that not burn out because i really did want to continue to create content. but i hit a down spot. and then i felt it come back finally and was like im going out making a vlog and kick this pig back in gear. and i did alright. for a bit but noticed it wasnt the same thing i was doing more stuff for the business end of things here not  my channel. the things i really started it for. but i was back. and then covid struck and i tried to get my self out of a funk i once again ound myself in. and welll ive been sayin i want to vlogg i have new stuff  that pertains to my channel that i can use for content and such and ive been sayin it  for too long now. i need to break out the camera and get going again. maybe i need to do like you guys did and go back through and look at my old vloggs and like you hopefully maybe get  inspired again by my own stuff.  BE U DO U. i love your channel and have been here for a long time now, i wont be going anywhere.  i get it i understand it. hey were human right haha love all you guys hugs n smiles.
Why was this recommended to me
Your lucky your area is open to no masks
Mexicanos por favor 🙏 fijensen bien por quien estarias votando es tu responsabilidad
No pressure to inspire. That is a lot for one person to try to do every day. Just living your life is inspiring enough. I love to see what you are up to. You do not have to try very hard. Just seeing you guys and the kids is enough to keep me watching. Cora is adorable and I love her energy. The rock tumbling is fun. I used to try and find the coolest rocks to tumble when I was a kid in the 70s. Yes, I am old. LOL. Love the animals too. Donkeys and chickens and goat would be fun too. It would be neat to open up your vlog with a trip out to check on the eggs every day - just like an old farmer would do! haha Love you guys! Keep smiling! ♥
Do you guys still have the dogs?
Where’s flash
Get yourself a rooster to protect the flock from aerial predators, for anything else a new pup

Rosman will get Male chicken need more     or
Great new-old mindset to just press record and film without any worries about trying to “out-beat” the past you. We all change and that’s life. and besides I think everyone loves the real raw day to day moments you capture! even the days you got nothing planned for like buying chickens and such.. we all love you and your family very very much! Much love brother ❤️
I mean #44 on trending and a million views, I'd say its entertaining.
Entertaining goes both ways thank you for everything you entertain us with your life vlogs we get to see you and the family like we’re apart of it whatever you have to do always know will be by your side : ) I loved the end the chicks smart lol perfect peace
Like the easing into vlogs again . Just enjoy Roman then maybe a few fun crazy times mixed in when you are ready.
Always loved the family vlogs. Love seeing the smile more fam again.
idk who this is but i forgive you idk
Inspirational is entertaining
Where is Flash at??
Get that coop secured with a top and their fence dug down a couple feet. The ladies will love yah even more. There are so many cute options out there.
We love the day to day and the chit chatting please keep it going..you inspire  and uplift us when we're down or just mucking about.. love the family.. I've rock tumbled  my mom inspired me to do it xoxo
Me
Im glad you and the family is fine now and back with us. I have missed watching the videos you are all awesome in. Bless you all always! Keep up the great work.♥️😊🌷💛
I Love the Sunshine Hat! Runner up-the heart, then rainbow and the balloon last
I laughed so hard when she said “Yes! Let’s have more kids” 😂😂
haha when she said lets have more kids and roman was like no lol
Rainbow for the ✨alphabet mafia✨
Roman, nevermind worrying about entertainment. Obviously we love it, but we also just love to see you and your family. That alone is enough to lift me up.
My favourite vlogs have always been threat to day family vlogs. Yes the crazy vlogs are entertainment but the normal family vlogs make people feel more connected . I'll support Roman no matter what.
Love the Atwood vlogs either way. I work for a crystal and minerals store off of 62. We have tons of rocks for kids to tumble and so much more. Also I bought one of your white t shirts a month or so ago and recently tie dyed it. It’s so cool. Can’t wait to wear it to work on the weekend.
Okay now here me out, I’m not the one jumping to conclusions BUT. In the middle Brit says “KIDS, let’s have more kids!” And Roman gave her like a dead stare. Then at the end she said “Are we not gonna tell them?” Just think about it guys! Is there going to be another baby soon?
To me I like the raw videos of family!!
No your not sorry
what, no popcorn from RK on the vlog?
We love just watching your family grow. The raw family moments are the best becausewe feel like we are there with you! We feel like we are part of your family too 💜 keep this type of stuff coming
Roman man just seeing your family interaact and seeing you helps me in ways you may not understand. just being yall is what inspires me everyday. All love and support from me bro.
Yall need to start drinking again
You guys just went through a really traumatizing couple of years. Go easy on yourselves! We love to be part of your day, and love when you’re part of ours! Do what feels right.
I think this is entertaining
These are the kind of vlogs i enjoy so much!
Just post when ever  and tell us about what
Okay but there are hens /chicken 🐓
Where are the dogs??
@ Exactly 9:08mins; 🤣🤣 Romans reaction to Britts "More kids!??!😉"....priceless!
I’m happy to see the real, family things. I enjoy these vlogs so much.
I have chicken's but mine are the banner chicken so they are a little smaller than most
I hope that older woman has a strong heart.
ur dad is beyond talented i love it
The chances of you seeing this is probably very low, but I want you to know that your viewers, those who are here commenting and liking still today, support you in every way possible. You’re still working on ending a chapter that really changed things up for you guys for a while, not to mention the pandemic! You’ve got to find your new groove so that you can feel more comfortable back on the Internet. No matter how you feel about your videos, we are always just happy to be on the ride with you. Do what makes you feel best, but you’re definitely still entertaining! I’m so proud of everything you guys have done and the life you have the opportunity to live is so marvelous, beyond many of our dreams. You manage to uplift AND inspire us through your entertainment and we are grateful for you ❤️
Full house your??
I just want to watch daily videos of your REAL life.
You should buy a goat!!!!!!!!!!!!
<3
Do both do  entertaining and inspiring
Loving this new more laidback content.  We too are getting chickens soon!  U mentioned that some got eaten, I’ve been OBSESSED with @CarolinaCoops videos....they have amazing chicken coops!
I haven't worn a mask in months! Other than my prenatal appointments.
We love you guys to Roman
These vlogs r what makes u you❤️ keep making real life vlogs ... Not just entertaining ❤️
I absolutely LOVE chickens! Favorites are Polish and Guineas. I had a goat as my pet, He was a wether (castrated) and followed me around like a puppy dog.
ALMOST CRINGE, but not nearly Kek.
not gonna tell us about whatttttr
Stop trying to be entertaining! Just vlog what u want. That’s why it’s not fun for you because u worry about what others want to see. Those who support you will stay. I personally love any vlog u post.
Show your cars!!
Me
Love this type of post.....like you,.... all your fans have reached a different level of likes just as you have....keep it up!
We have about 25 chickens 10 bantam chickens and 25 serama chickens! Also like 5 serama chicks.
I prefer the normal family vlogs
All little kids like rainbows
Even if you don’t “entertain” I still like watching! Seeing the real day to day life is awesome.
Mama say dont say that hahahahahahahahaahahahaha
you should feed the mature chickens a bit of chickweed  every day it is very good for there health
Where’s flash
Jesus loves you all so much! He died on the cross for the price of our sins and 3 days later, he rose from the dead. He died for our sins so that we may have eternal life in Heaven with him and not perish in Hell. If you believe that with all your heart and confess that you are a sinner and in need of a savior, you will be saved! Come to Jesus and believe on him today!
My fam and I have goats and chickens
SMILE MORE
Roman atwood you will always be entertaining no madder what we will always be with you    smile more
It’s ok 👌 but not entertaining
Watching your family spread love and have pure fun doing the simple things is good enough, Roman! Don’t beat yourself up for it! We love what you put out no matter the content 🖤
I got chickens
I loved watching you guys go shopping and setting up the chickens! For some, who cannot have these things, it is VERY entertaining! Dont stop!!!! Vlog
You don't  have to entertain all the times when you are not  that's where  CORA  came in and she will entertain  us.
I love these vlogs! It is so entertaining you just chillin with the fam
Love you all no matter what you do. Just keep being yourselves. Much Love from the United Kingdom xx
These are my favorite kind of videos! I’d take real and raw, inspiring homey vlogs any day over “entertaining” ones!
This is entertaining and relaxing.
This is just pure entertainment Roman. keep it up champ
What happened to grandma's arm
I like the rainbow

Hi
All your videos are entertaining❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love the family vlogs!
i like watching you guys and knowing how everyone is doing and watching everyone grow
It’s always the messages at the end that brighten up my day
Definately get goats there so funny
what happened to flash?
iv got chicks
I love the heart one
My favorite vlogs are the family vlogs that just show your day to day activities
Roman is Gaston
I cant choose a hat, so all of em
Is the 5 minute clog that you are talking about is that the one with the helium where Noah was messing around with the helium
Narcissistic behavior at its finest
Dam still wearing masks in the UK 🇬🇧
but the family vlogs of u just living is entertaining to us!
Ugh
🇦🇺
I love watching family vlogs and the animals
His vlogs bring backs memory
Just know your a really good dad and person all together all your stuff is  entertaining and your a literal legend nice too watch the smile more videos again.
No need to entertain. Just take us along your day. We love these vlogs👍
💯💯💯
The chickens at the time 9:10 they do that to cool off sometimes or mine do at least
Why doesn’t brit ever pick up the camera !!!
Love your plants! 🪴❤
I love the real life insight you give us. When times are hard in my family it’s nice to take a break and see others happy in the simple things in life.
Is it me or do romans kids grow faster then normal
this man just got chickens this is entertaining
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Where is Flash????
Honestly it kinda bothers me that roman is still apologizing for not doing those big blockbuster vlogs when these kind of chill family vlogs are what made us all fans, and we love them.
It just great to feel a part of your day to day life
your videos always inspire and uplift me keep it up Atwood Family!
We got two backyard Chickies the week before #3 uploads started. Still no eggs yet.. they are reaching the other side of adolescence now but winter is just starting here so we could be waiting a while. We would be so sad to lose them! Looking at the space you all have for so many chickens makes me SO impatient for the future! One day, I'll have a paddock that I can dedicate to dozens of chickens. For now, our two Chickies and cat share our little patch of grass with us 🐓🐓😺💃🕺
Roman, Do your thing and don’t worry about what people think.  ❤️ you guys!!
Ahh yes another YouTube apology
Cora is now the entertainer 😍😍
YO HES STILL ALIVE ?!
What you are doing is always entertaining !
Here till the end!
Roman we just love seeing you and your family that’s all we care about we don’t care if it’s boring we don’t care if it’s not entertaining we just love the updates with you and your family that’s all we care about by the way I wanna see the GTR’s haven’t seen that in a minute minute
Tell us whaaaaaaat!?!?!
No more masks???
I always enjoyed your family days better than when you went out of your way trying to entertain us.

We have about 100
I got chickens from my mom, now i have waaaaay too many eggs. hatching eggs are pretty easy too if youre getting into it
I absolutely loved the raw family vlogs and when you would just sit down and talk to us. The movies were cool but life’s kinda busy sometimes
no mask?
cora is starting to sound like the chickens
You and your family are amazing
"yes kids lets have more kids" roman: o_o
just do you! ill love you guy whatever your doing
Brit saying there a hair small just because there not real crocs so she don’t want them
I have chickens I warn you the more you have the more eggs you get and then the less space you have in your refrigerator I hope you can eat 200 eggs a week
i love these.
I like any video you make. You are amazing and make me smile every time I watch you!
You will always be entertaining
Make mask
what ever you do not and I mean do not get roosters
*** I just LOVE seeing your beautiful family, Your family is surely so so beautiful. Also LOVED seeing the chickens and baby chickens.👍🏼💕💞❤️‍🩹👍🏼👍🏼
GET GOATS THEY ARE THE BEST
I used to have road islan reds buts coyotes got em. Our coop is falling apart so were in the process of trying to rebuild it but the prices of lumbar is outrageous but once its fixed i want polish chickens snd goats
No more masks? I think they're still important, please wear your masks!
Sunshine hat is my favorite!!!
Yo post whatever it is you shoot we will be here dude!
I love the family vlogs
Am I crazy or cora doesn’t have blue eyes???
When did they start doing cliffhangers???
I love just watching your family do there day to day stuff!
I think you should focus on inspiring if that’s where your heads at. Honestly it’s hard to find inspiring content that’s not “cringy”. I enjoy watching your videos because I always leave with an uplifted attitude and just more inspired to work towards my goals. I appreciate the content you’ve been putting out all these years, it’s crazy to me how much some random guy on the internet can be someone who helps me thru all the stuff in life.
I’m always curious about how they actually feel about social & political views, then I fight it and just enjoy the vids and feel happy🤦🏻‍♂️ great video
Btw I love these kind of vlogs
Brit: let’s have more kids, Roman 😑
I had 2 pet chickens growing up they were adorable! Loved um
i love this kind of vlog
i have about 500+ chickens  thats because we have a whole egg hatching business
Just be you !! We love your clogs & your beautiful family 🥰
Inspiration
We love you guys. 💗
Smile More
You have to remember that the people you entertained are also the people that have grown up too with family’s that relax and watch ur vlogs now.... soooo next time.... name the 🪴 are those fig trees??
I think everyone is entertained by just watching you and you family doing what you do. You inspire and entertain by just making a normal day vlog. Keep doing what you do
Wait wait wait you can’t not tell us about 👀👀👀
re you ever going to stop being sorry?
what did you do and FYI I know its been Like 5 Years But I still hate you 😁
if you remember before you left roman all the comments wanted more real genuine "family vlogs" as you put it this is it.
Y’all just have a fun and inspiring life and that to me is entertaining and I will never not watch your vlogs.
Put some glass in the rock polisher. Sea glass is awesome!
This is the first time I’ve ever seen and heard someone cuss in his vlogs 😂
Haven’t seen this man in years and the first thing I see is “I’m sorry”
I just love that “if you’re going to be with us, then just be with us“ ❤️ and Kane’s hair is always cool, but that platinum blonde color really looks amazing!
I love videos like this just vlog wat u do
Roman i want you to know, that I and a bunch of other people that watch you don't care what you do, all we want you to do is post videos
These are the best of types of vlogs :)
Roman your life is entertaining
If you get geese they will protect the chickens from preditors and alert you to them
More videos. Even if we just go to the chickens with you. Family is family and that’s what it’s become over the last like 7 years lol.
you need get fatting goats if you ger goats
So do the vlogs every 2 days my boy
These vlogs are still entertaining bro! We love being part of the family
Man, don’t even. You’ve been entertaining us with sick content since the day you started YouTube. Now you’re a legend, and always, always, be entertaining no matter what. ✨
As a kid I used to watch your videos now I’m 16 going on 17 and I really feel like I’ve been able to grow with your channel. Such an inspiration from day one!!
This makes me sick
God loves you all unconditionally guys remember Jesus paid the price for your sins and you can’t truly be happy or redeem yourself until you accept Him as your personal Lord in savior He died for you individually and thought of YOU READING THIS on the cross
video starts at 17 min

I like the calm aspects, not that much the entertainment.
Acts like he does all the work. Smh
Literally loved today’s vlog!!!!  I’ve been watching for 8 years, and it was so nice to see a regular vlog. You can be entertaining without have to put a facade!
Right now in today's times, I say Inspiration more than entertainment. Humanity could use a good dose of Inspiration! You do inspire by your vlogs. Thanks!
I dont even know who you are?
I find this very entertaining! I also love the new pets!!
all your videos are entertaining
Roman, I want to see your plants. Deep dive, let’s go.
Karma will get this man one day
We have chicks and they are so cool.
"they were the sweetest chickens, on the world!"
❤️❤️❤️
I enjoyed this video. I also enjoy going over to Heath to Rural King. It's my favorite farm store.
Don’t stress it just casual vlog like this one are totally fine. No need for epic stuff. Glad you are slowing coming back
Always here forever ❤️

You’ve always been uplifting Roman. Just keep being you. Whether you inspire, or entertain. You’re always uplifting & making someone’s day. Keep being you ❤️
He only does videos when he has merxh  to push

Personally your chill vlogs like this one are the better ones. More real and natural and to be honest they’re just as entertaining as any other vlog you’ve done before ☺️
You do you
My youngest daughter got a chicken and named her BBQ
Family vlogs are so dam toxic
9:34 the internal temperature needs to be 165°F.
Hey Roman where is flash and the other cat ?
i honestly really love these homey vlogs. i feel apart of your family.
I love the family vlogs! They are entertaining and inspiring! Love it. Keep it up! Also want an update on your dad! Hopefully he is doing good ❤️
I absolutely love these kinds of vlogs, very wholesome
Kora is such a sweetheart
I love these videos, the family style vlogs! Just about things you do in your day to day life! I’ll always watch no matter what type of videos you do!! ❤️🥰
Roman everything you put out is amazing, if it’s  inspiring or entertaining. I mean just normal vlogs are amazing, I’m sure they inspire so many people but also entertain them. At least they do me because it inspires me to do better as a person and really move on from anything negative in life
Your Vlogs are ALWAYS entertaining!  You guess put a smile on my smile, when I’m happy and when I’m upset.  Much love ❤️
*Imo you guys are ALWAYS entertaining and ALWAYS inspirational in EVERY vlog weather you’re trying to be or not, love seeing you guys back!* ♥️
These vlogs are entertaining.
I like the rainbow
If I was Noah I wouldn’t work a day in my life no capper
I love the family/chill vlogs, those put me in an UNBELIEVABLY good mood 😍
I cant believe im still watching them 7 years later
apology speedrun fail
POV: everyone buys the sunshine one
I don’t follow many people,I am a nana of 8 who keep me busy ,along with being full time RN.Your family is fun,real and I really missed you when you were off!!!
Where can I get that train horn gun
I spilled my gatorade when Roman said they will be 6 feet tall by July 😂
Honestly I prefer just fun family vlogs just fine 😊😊
We have 50 chickens, 5 turkeys,2 ducks 2 cows, 2 donkeys, 7 pigs and 13 goats and goats are great
9:05 my favorite part
For me it’s inspiration over entertainment
5:05 he caught himself
Gotta say. Living In Canada, I'm envious of your situation with Covid. Québec, Canada, our PM is unsure about christmas 2021 *Facepalm*
You’re always entertaining but less focus on being entertaining makes you more relateable as a YouTuber. I can’t relate to the ACE family because my family doesn’t live like that.
Carnelian and agate
I absolutely love you Roman Atwood!! You are the greatest youtuber of all time, my favorite youtuber and celebrity of all time!! You always lift me up, keep up the amazing work! Smile more
Brittany:“I’m about to run this lady over she’s not gonna smile”  Me: dang she got dark real fast!
You don’t have to ‘entertain’ us you just have to be you.
Honestly I’ll take any content u post lol
I go to the smile more Farm
Roman shaking his head at the end 😂
Where is flash? We have not see the flash..

Your normally supposed to have marbles or stones on the water bowl so the chicks don’t drown
The 5 minutes vlogs are entertaining too! Please understand we love you guys no matter that content as long as we see your beautiful one of a kind faces ☺️
You got it. Take all the time you need!
Where’s max?
We hatch our own chickens
Hi Roman, I really do love your vlogs- however boring you may find them I can assure you that is not the case! I really admire your positivity. I wondered how you felt about talking about grief? I know you’ve felt it so tough over the past couple of years, I am now going through it myself and just don’t know how to cope with it or what to do. I really look up to you, Thankyou for inspiring me always x
I have 4 rn
we love all the phases of your life, we love to see everything ... wonderful to see yall so happy 🧡
“Are we not gonna tell them about?.....” noooo don’t do that to us you can’t just say that and then cut it off ahhhhhhhhh 
Wait where is flash?
That cliffhanger though...
His look had me dead when she said “kids let’s have more kids” 😂
Definitely inspire! Entertaining is just a bonus! I love you inspiration and it uplifts me at least by a lot!!! Thank you so much!!!
I love that you guys don’t wear mask I wonder if y’all got the vaccine I really hope y’all didn’t get the jab
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
I have 3 chickens and I don't think I have gotten store eggs for a long time
Tell me how mama looks younger
How do you know between chick eggs and regular eggs?
Your not sorry
Roman when are you gonna get your own pawm trees
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
The constant update is awzing
You're inspiring ESPECIALLY from a parent's point of view...it's the little things that matter... my 13 yr old loves you guys! And FOR ONCE its not a NEGATIVE VIDEO! He brought me to you guys!
Wish I had enough room for more chickens ♥️ I just got four new little chicks and I’m already in love
No joke Roman, but you could legit post a 30 minute video of just you and the family watching tv and I would still watch it
Rural king is the store you were at
"They look a hair small" "Throw them in the cart" hahaha
Omgggg the ending.... tell us what??? 🙈
When do we get to hear the full story about the FBI and the stalkers?
Guys just vlog it’s entertaining  we all love you 😽
I've had chickens for 8 years now. I have around 25 rn.
What I was going to watch you was going to watch you for you and your family because they like you just do what makes you happy that's interesting enough don't make something entertaining that looks sad and drives people away
I’m so glad that you don’t wear masks anymore here in uk we still do. I look forward to not wearing masks and washing your hands every hour. Gives us hope that you guys are getting normal again. 💜
We are getting chickens Friday 6 of them
Hey Roman I have seen several videos where people have chickens and they have a great Pyrenees to help protect the chickens and other small animals you have. Just a thought, love your videos🥰🇨🇦
Do farm and garden videos please
Making Memories.  Awesome.
To be honest Roman you don’t always have to do entertaining vlog chill days are cool to you literally could post it on the couch and watch Netflix with the family and film it we’d still watch lmao but thank you for all of the great content that you provide us with and thank you for everything over the years bro 💯💯
Love the heart one cause it reminds to spread the love around and we need that more in the world

Trending #7
You’re overthinking....just go with it
You should check out White House on The Hill. I love their channel, they hatch all sorts of birds.
sorry give up on inspiring while recording in your Mansion and most followers have NOTHING, how depressing!  And selling product to add to your millions from kids that work their ass off to afford it!
I have some chickens
You should have gotten Easter Egger chickens, they lay blue green eggs and I bet the kids would love them. I almost bought a few the other day when my tractor supplies near me got them in
i love anything you out out but these feel so much like we’re all actually family which i love sm
Jesus Christ loves you soooo much
MOST OF ALL DONT FORGET THEIR HEAT LAMP
i used to have big chickens but one of them got snatched by a bird so we had to give the other away because we can't leave them alone
I LOVE CHICKENS!!! We hatched most of ours. We have 13 acres all together!! We had cows. horses, quail, pigs, at one point we had 62 chickens lol
When the chickens roll In the dirt they are taking a dirt bath which keeps certain bugs off of them and make sure when you introduce the new chickens with the old chickens do it at night so they don’t see them then attack them
Always enjoy your vlogs and you definitely inspire me. I have a bunch of things I want to do but they seem so hard to accomplish. No matter what kind of day I'm having your vlogs never fail to make me smile.
Where’s flash?
7-8 yrs watching this channel idk why, but i always come back

I love these types of vlogs I’m being entertained
Hi roman actully i like these types of vlogs. Just what your doing...life. I did like when you did
I’ve been watching since I was 6 and I’m 13 now if I’m not a Loyal fan I don’t know what is
That’s for saying the ones who stay to the end and listen to the tea is the real ones and I been here since 2017 and I love u man I’m not the best son or the best kid or best at anything but you help train kindness and teach and important it is to smile more
Would love to see a Paul cuffaro and Atwood farm family callab

A good “chicken guru” is MaryCarl from Cog Hill Farm. She’s a young 12yr old girl that is a chicken genius!
No I love the entertainment I love this kind of videos
No need for “Entertaining”.  Just vlog the daily family, “homesteading”, animals stuff.  Don’t need skits or challenges or pranks. I think you’ve grown beyond those things and are drawn to a different format.
still my favorite vlogger! you’re doing great seriously:)
Honestly it's entertaining just seeing what you guys are up to every once and a while you have a interesting life and it always seems to be fun
These vlogs are the BEST!!! Keep doing what you guys do best :)
i mean to me ur doing both bro
I absolutely love this type of content it’s to raw and real and inspiring.❤️
We miss flash. You should bring him in a Vlog at least
I have 24 chickens.
Yall so lucky in Vegas we are still wearing mask because to many people come here to visit and bring corona here and they don't care bout the people who live here and just seeing u makes me so happy
Inspiratainment
These kind of videos are really interesting, don't worry Roman!😊
The atwood farm is were i live for... dont worry you are still doing a great job❤️
Roman! you are always an inspiration! your videos are always uplifting! love the farm life!
Roman make sure those fiddle leaf fig trees are in indirect sunlight.
You're doing a great job! Enjoy your life, enjoy your marriage, enjoy your children. It's hard to do and you all have worked so hard to get to this point. Proud of y'all!  Remember,  the day is only what YOU make of it.  You're making people smile all around the world. There's nothing better than seeing someone smile. When I was kid we wrote notes and folded them in cool ways and hand them to each other. I used to sign  my notes "smile"  -Annette
Roman you really help me out when i lost my mum two years ago i would like to vist yo some time i miss mum lots  love to your family xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx simon from the uk

I live in chronic pain because of 2 failed back surgeries.  I tried to start my channel and I got pushed out.  I love your videos keep up the good work.
Consider Justin Rhodes
You grown up I like it/ stay  safe
Me, my husband, & our 3 children just started our chicken farm in early March. We have 15 chickens and 3 ducks. We love it. We also plan to have goats by the end of the year. Pretty cool to be on a similar journey. I really enjoy the real life, family time vlogs so don't stress yourself out over it. Your fan base will watch you regardless!
Just do what makes u happy if it's one vlog a week or two its fine
I am a chicken person lol. I have 45 chickens, 15 ducks, 5 turkeys, 3 quails, 3 goats, 7 bunnies, 2 dogs, 4 cats, 2 reptipes, a snake, a hedgehog and two 50 gallon fish tanks

Please continue to vlog we appreciate every part of you and your family.
you uplift by entertaining bro
Cliffhanger!!!
Either way I'm entertained and inspired! It's so hard to not lose the original momentum...you are not the same people as you were 10+ years ago and that is okay! So it makes sense that the content would change and evolve with you and your lives. I enjoyed this update! It was always my favorite after a long day to just sit down and watch you enjoy your family, just doing the silly and inspiring everyday things. Personally, I don't think you could fall short. Just keep being you..
been here since the 1st house, also farmer roman i love it
This is entertaining
Inspiration is entertainment, the good kind ❤️😉
I am a viewer who has been watching for a long time and actually got married, has had kids ect. in a similar timeline of you guys. I get what you are saying but I think it has been cool to watch your journey, as I understand the feelings of just focusing on kids and family. I love watching the reality of family vlogs and even wish I could hear about homeschooling. I laughed at the comment about “yeah, let’s have more kids!” 😐 😂😅 we are on # 3 and I get that too, lol
What were you going to tell us? 😅😜
I love the rainbow for it is Gods promise of his covenant ❤️🌈🙏🏻
MORE OF THIS!!!!! PLEASE!!!!! I love these videos and you guys! Keep it up :)
Do you still have the gtr
Love you guys.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I still wanna see if Noah did ever get his hair cut

Are used to love watching your Vlogs They were adventuring funny now they’re just depressing
Imagine retiring at 38, we could only wish
I was just at Rural King 3 day’s ago!! I literally always miss you by a day or a couple. I’ll go to Vance’s and my friend Danielle will tell me that you just left an hour ago or something. 😂 one day!
TELL US WHAAAAT!?
These videos are just the best ! It don’t matter if you are sitting in the couch doing nothing. You guys are just the best. :)
We’ve all grown with you and now I have a family of my own! About to have baby #2 (second boy) any day now! You guys have been my absolute favorite vloggers and would love to see more family content to relate to! 😊❤️
Man I been here from the beginning and this video took me back 😭
Is this an apology video or a.stupid vlog with an apology part in it like Logan Paul's?
So weird you guys don't have to wear a mask where I am in Canada we barley have cases and you have to wear a max everywhere even if you're vaccinated
i love and miss these types of videos!
I LOVE your vlogs! You should continue to inspire us because you really do entertain us.
Keep rolling the camera man. Even the 'normal' family vlogs are my favorite, and it's absolutely entertaining and inspiring for me!
i love everything about your life. keep making videos
it doesn't matter what you film, it matters that you keep doing what you started and love to do.
We love to just see what you are doing. You don't have to entertain every time or ever if you don't want to. Just love you guys no matter what 🙂SmileMore
Roman, a lot of us have been following you for many years. We love to see your family’s everyday life and that is entertaining for us. Your family is our family!!
I swear these niggas make a apology video every month
Love the plant pot your dad made, it looks amazing!😱
HAPPY TO SEE YOU POST VIDEOS!!! keep em coming, entertaining or inspiring... we just love the fam
You can do both.  I love the inspiration which is also entertaining.  The funny stuff can be thrown in randomly
YOOO STILL THE SAME INTRO AS YEARS AGO
Just post what you record. I don’t watch your videos for the content. I watch you for your messages or advice. You always entertain and inspire
Perfect vlog
It's the Atwoods lol,love you guys. And I think it's safe to say most of us enjoy all your vlogs no matter what they are good and bad.  You guys are admirable and truly inspirational
Follow what you feel the real ones will stay🤘
Where’s FLASH???
Brit: kids, let's have more kids Roman: 😐  🤣🤣🤣 I am dead.
Any and all Atwood content is uplifting and inspiring to me, so everyday life is great, Roman. Just hit record and give us your beautiful Atwood smiles!
We had a bunch of silkies and frizzle chickens we sale they are the goofiest looking chickens
You inspire people everyday Roman....don’t try you already do I promise
Bruh I died when he said about the rocks okey guys Ill see you in a month 😭😭😭
Where’s flash
i love chickeys
keep these coming please. Brings back good memories
I feel like most people worry about money and health and maintaining those things, that we rarely take the time to slow down and enjoy living and life. It's go, go, go. All the time. We are bound by our schedules and don't do things spontaneously anymore. I feel it every day. I hate schedules and routines. But some of us need them. Thanks for showing us a snippet of your life. Of course you're not going to show us the boring parts of life and taking care of your business. We all need to have a healthy balance. Too much work or too much play isn't good for any of us. Often finding that balance is a daily struggle as it shifts with the season of life that we're in. It has to. Sometimes our kids have needs that need to be attended to where we will have to drop whatever it is we're doing at the moment to meet those needs, and so on.
you’ve always gotta remember to never worry about what your posting. we love you. we love what you do. i even personally loved the chicken bit. reminded me of when i was a kid. the point is, just do what you love. you and your family put a smile to millions of faces. always continue to do what you do and never let anyone convince you otherwise. thank you for everything.
YES!!!! Let's Goooooo! Just like Cora says, "if you want to be with us, be with us!" - I love you guys SO much to infinity and back!
Inspiring is more better than entertaining there's a lot of toxic youtuber right now doing shit just to entertain there followers and that's not cool...
Heyyy Roman are you happy?
I love how positive they are
Any kind of video from roman is a great video for me
Love you guys!!
hi
I personally enjoy the just raw every day life vlogs. It’s more realistic and relatable. I enjoy the real life videos more than the “entertaining” ones.
You will always be entertaining! Don’t even stress about it, these videos will always be my favourite
Brit "yeah kids, lets have more kids"  Roman "😁😑" Hahaha it killed me
I think this is perfect Roman, if this is the kind of video or “ inspiring” type then it’s great love it keep them up 👍 also love your dad pot he made its awesome if your seeing this tho I would pay good amount of money for one made. 😌
Thing is... if all that terrible stuff really happened why risk your family’s safety? You live in a mansion not a humble house...... not a good look.
Contact “Sba Help Centre” on lnstagram if you haven’t been funded or have any issues. I got funded yesterday. He helped me out...!!!
Honestly the best type of vlogs!! Would love to know how ur dads going btw
Who thinks Brit is pregnant again lol
For the chickens you should make a small area fenced off and in the day let them Rome in that area and every night put them in their coop so they don’t get eaten.
People who have never had a farm fresh egg, don't know what they are missing. I will never be able to eat a store bought egg again. They are so flavorless.
No matter the content, I’m always glad to see the fam happy and having fun(:
No matter entertaining or inspiring they’re always great
I will always watch you and I hope you see this because me and kora have the same birthday July 16th
Love these types of vlogs. They are entertaining and interesting. Please continue with this type of vlog. They are great to watch. Thanks for making them.
Can we get a garage update.
I JUST WANT TO SEE FLASH😢 can you still get him and live with you guys?
Where’s Flash?!
been forever, watch till the end. Love you guys always. Changed me as a person so i think you guys deserve a thank you❤️
مفيش حد هناا بيتكلم عربي اكلم نفسي ياعني 😂😂
Roman, I asked my mom about getting a hat. she said maybe!  Wish me luck
I’m curious now. What are you going to tell us about.😁😁😁
The suspense in the end!! 😂❤️
Don’t worry you’re always entertaining.
when they are rolling in the dirt its actually them having a dirt bath :)
Cora looks exactly like Brit
It’s always drama with y’all
HAHA THAT ENDING THOUUUUUGH
I got chickens!!
Your family were wearing the crown for YouTube Content before everything happened, it’s incredible to see you being able to comeback and still pushing your positive energy and happiness back into the world after what must of been a very tough time, seeing you all again is just what  people need as proof tough times never last and you can get through it with a positive attitude and outlook so thank you 🙏🏼
You entertain me and inspire me so there’s no need in overthinking this
Any video Roman uploads is entertaining
Family vlogs are amazing! And very up lifting!
Roman Atwood how is your Dad
I would get the sunshine
This is very entertaining. Your daily blogs and just taking it along we’re the best and so was this video. Keep your head up man!!
I just got a shirt from smile more for my bday but its too small 😩 and theres no returns 😫

You haven’t showed the gtr in a long time please show us it
lets go hes back
Im wondering what the guy at 4:54 was thinking lol he forsure heard the “they were the first to get eaten”
Where's Flash??
I challenge you roman to beat your 50 vlogs in a row  Who’s with me??  Give this a like if you agree
House Tourrrrrrrrr
That ending... why bro? 🤣😭
Also, I'm here for some inspiration 💕💕
Dont worry its entertainment and really cool
You showed us super cute chicks and say it’s not entertaining.  What’s wrong with you.  This is exactly what I wanted to see.
Your all ways entertaning
Me too
I want that you start with daily vlogging again:)
I got chickens a bunch of chickens
I feel like it doesn't have to be one or the other. I think you can be uplifting/inspiring and also have some entertaining aspects in there. That's why you have the audience you have, you've offered a little bit of both across all of your videos and people connect with that. Don't limit yourself and don't second guess. Turn on that camera and put out what you wanna put out, the people will come. Keep being you.
Roman we love everything you do ! No matter what you film , we are always entertained!
Blue balloon
I miss flashy
Maw maw ❤️❤️😍
I love firework truck
Cora is so precious 💗
We have chickens as well and I will say the best feed for your grown chickens is premium chicken feed with oyster shells makes the shell harder so they won't crack as easy
I loved the ending
We got 5 chickens and a duck 🤙 since the first 5 went well i think were gonna get 5 more ducks and 5 more chickens lol
I think no matter what you have done or do, it is uplifting. You being you is uplifting. Just do what ever makes you happy and we can feel that :) Thank you for sharing your life with us. We love you
Where is Flash? Have I missed a vlog
I love the everyday vlogs even if YOU think it's boring
Can we get a housetour plz:( Thanks for the happiness
i’m a 100 % with you guys
I’m sorry but you just really remind me of a teacher at my school his name is Mr Mackenzie and he is a math teacher😂also I love your videos and I would love if you responded to this comment, your energy is just so amazing and I’m glad I started watching you guys🥰
U are boring AF bro
we love farm(fun) stuff hahaha
I love when you guys vlog your daily lives! I don’t care about the rest.
Just wanted to see if anyone knows what happened to flash
Great to see grandma in the vlog we missed her  Smile more❤
Hello friends 🤗 im from europe here  Quick question do you guys still have to wear a mask in US ? Because Roman and family doesn't wear one ???
Hello friends 🤗 im from europe here  Quick question do you guys still have to wear a mask in US ? Because Roman and family doesn't wear one ???
I like when you say incubator, make a weird noise and then realize you don’t know how that works.
That ending tho. And her comments about more kids. And Brit’s glow. Y’all are 🤬🤬 pregnant again.
More fun! Some inspo
Stop apologizing dude. We all just happy to see you. Its a new chapter of your life. Stop looking to the past for answers an allow yourself to move forward. Much respect
I’m happy your back
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
inspiration > entertainment 100000%  Even family vlogs are amazing to see! Just being you is absolutely wonderful to watch! :') <3
I love this kind of vid
Anyone knows what happened to Flash?
Happy birthday to you happy birthday Happy birthday to you happy birthday dear Roman Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
If Brit isn’t pregnant I’ll be suprised...
I’ve been watching since I think 13/14  years old, I’m now 19 and still love every video no matter how long I’m between. Keep it up even if it’s just a high, good morning and smile more I’ll still watch every time
These are the best vlogs. I love watching real day to day things 😊 but obviously do what makes YOU happy 🥰
I used to rock tumble but I have no clue where it went
You are lucky. We still cant take a mask off in South Africa :(
I have 18 chickens
Always happy to see y'all no matter the content. Sometimes the hard times are forever. Much love y'all.
Were is noah
I love you Roman but man let your mum talk. You kept interrupting the crap out of her
that cliffhanger  ending...
Please keep filming. I need the chicken updates 😂 and rock updates. You’re living the life I want but can’t have 😂 x
Inspiring is alright by me, just glad to see you guys! 🙋🏽‍♀️🥰🤗🙏🏽
At one time we used to have close to 80 chickens my buddy has 2 chicken barns they r about 25k chickens in each barn
Just love catching up with the family.
Please pray for my mom who's in the ICU on a ventilator fighting for her life against this virus. Her name is Doris. Thankfully my brother is recovering after a hard battle with it. They are my only family. If you can take a second to pray for her please.
Vlogging is for seeing what you’re up to, not to be doing crazy things all the time. I love watching the chicken content 😂 tell me facts haha x
What happen to the donkeys??(nvm he sown the donkey lol 😂)
Where is flash ??????
Why are the videos so depressing stop this bs
Chickens roll in dirt to dust themselves to protect them from. Insects. If I’m not mistaken. But keep it up.  I love the farm vlogs! 😂 y’all should look into some Easter eggers. They lay green and blue eggs
Farmer Roman is the only logical progression for his career at this point.
I’d love farmer Roman vlogs! I’m at that point in my life too 😂 so works for me!
Great vid! Brits looking hot as ever 👌🏼
18
Being the same age as you we're knocking on 40s door😭
When are you doing a house tour video
Entertainment on YouTube is not you no more we just love to hear what you have to say and catch up with your beautiful family
when i had a chicken it run a muck
Bro we love those kind of vlogs,   stay safe love u guys 🙂🙂
Yes! Inspire!
YES Sir
This kind of content is good and for some future ideas maybe redo some of the old vlogs
To whoever is reading this:  I know it's not always easy, but you will feel better You are not alone. You are important, no matter whether you see it or not. You matter, I promise Don't give up, think positively and believe in yourself ( ◜‿◝ )♡  Have a good day/night 🖤

You need ducks ☺️☺️☺️
Did I miss something or is Flash mysteriously missing from the vlogs? I haven't seen him in the new house as of yet and in the past he would always make it into the vlog at some point??  Did something happen to him, or did you give him to one of your relatives??
We just got finished raising 35 chickens ,10 turkeys, and 25 ducks and we finally let them outside the other day and thank god
These vlogs are entertaining.
50% entertaining 50% motivate (just bc everybody dream to chill with family and chickens 😁)
Could we please get a full house tour when you’re ready, love the vlogs❤️
I’m thinking the long time viewers just want to see the family and see how you guys are doing. Daily life stuff is entertaining if you’ve been following the journey to this point. Keep doing what ya doing :)
💛😊👍

Thank God you are back!  I keep looking out for your next video!  I have missed you!  Seeing you and your beautiful family is always entertaining and uplifting!  I do enjoy a longer vlog with educational content or entertainment!  Either way!  Watching you all is always enjoyable!  I love seeing you be you!  I love seeing you be candid!  You don't have to put on an act or plan epic productions!  I just love seeing y'all interact with each other and pull together in team work to make these awesome vlogs possible!!!  Keep them coming, Roman!!!  I love you all!!!  Smile more and God bless you all!!!
chicken roll in dirt to keep the parasites out
You post we watch. I really don't care what you post just as long as you post
I don’t think you can know the gender when they are that young
Anyone else think she might be pregnant again? very unlikely. but the hint with her jokingly wanting more kids and then at the end 😂
It’s my birthday
Love any vlog that you do ❤
Wait hold up. That ending tho. Y’all really did us like that😭
Last few months have been super hard so thanks for this vlog no matter if its 5 minutes or an hour vlog you always make my day better you truly are one of a kind and continue to make me smile more!
Worried abt vlogging just your day to day? Check out Colleen Ballinger (Miranda Sings) Vlogs. Hers are very raw, very simple vlogs & her fans love them.
when do we get a house tour?
Cora is actually so cute
I'm sorry to say this but roman or the people who publish his videos should stop making clickbaits. I thought you would be the man who didn't fall into that category of people
Roman your wayyyy too hard on yourself bro. Anyone watching you considers you family so dont worry about being "entertaining" all the time. As you said...just roll the camera!
Even tho you're just showing what you do in a normal day it's entertaining, cause we love your family and we wanna see what you guys are up to and how you're doing. You're always inspiring us naturally Roman, so just keep being you. Smile MORE! <333
i prefer these vlogs

That wasn't cool leaving us on a cliffhanger but anyways always happy to see a video from you guys no matter what it is ❤
Tell us about what 🤔
Get the bramas chickens bro
Just seeing the everyday life with the family and the animals is inspiring, it's the life many want but don't have. So vlogs like this one are still inspiring❤
We love all versions of “Roman Atwood Vlogs”
The problem is we have 13 roosters and i guess 10 chickens i’m no sure how many 😂
not to be rude or anything but how many sory vids u gonna make
Thanks for the vulnerability... you owe is nothing. Thanks for making me smile throughout the last, almost four years during my cancer journey.
“Are we not gonna tell them about?.....” noooo don’t do that to us you can’t just say that and then cut it off ahhhhhhhhh 😂😂😂
Do y'all have donkeys still or ya get rid of them cus if a stalker too ??
Seems like all the vids you post are im sorry
What happen to the donkeys??????🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎
Its very fun to watch Roman's vlog . He just make us feel like we are a part of the family
Where is flash at
Don’t worry about entertainment just a vlog makes us enjoy it. We watch for you and the family and not just to get entertained. Like many on here we’ve invested a piece of our heart to the Atwood’s and love to see the updates of what’s going on with the Atwood’s. Much love from Daniel and Maria in California.
Where is flash? Love the vlogs :D <3

hi roman ,how is your awsome dad doing ?
I love it, seriously. Rainbow hat  :D and I have chickens
Roman remain still one of the OG vloggers! not too many on them anymore, so enjoy thir content, while it lasts
I swear every video you post is an apology video
I look always watching you I started watching you before I even have a YouTube account and I’ve been watching you for 6+ years
I feel like they just make a video for merch lol
Very nice 🥰🥰
We love your vlogs and uplifting is always welcomed with opened arms
Where is flash?
Great vlogs
Roman u don't need to entertain us with doing crazy stuff seriously I just wanna see you and your family doing family stuff ♥️ I love your vlogs greetings from Germany
Tell us about????
Roman, you should put the tumbler in your room to replace the fan for noise machine. lol
I actually prefer the family vlogs.
It's crazy to some but, I will ALWAYS watch these videos. I don't care about the frequency or content. It's like popping in on your friends and just experiencing their daily life. Not doing anything special? It doesn't matter. Film it! That's how it is when you genuinely like people. You want to be around them/watch their vlogs. This vlog gave me a peaceful feeling. Can't wait to see y'all again. God bless.
No matter what you show us, it is entertaining AND inspiring. You dont always have to get Monster Trucks or drive a bus into a pond. The family stuff is great too. Like we love you guys dearly
My chickens have many ages and we get so many chicks but I don’t have an incubator the just hatch naturally
They was in a store called rural king it's honestly a great store
i love chikens
These are the best vlogs hands down. You don’t ever have to worry about not entertaining us
goats, pigs, lets go
Still waiting about the Flash. Where Flashy??
You should go to Europe! Make a movie there.
I am entertained :)
ayeeeeee fellow chicken owner here! we got our first flock in the beginning of 2018. unfortunately it’s really normal for animals to eat them. we only have 2 left from our original flock of 12. we also have rhode island red’s too! chickens are the best pets💜 look into svart honas. they are said to be the most friendly and docile chickens that exist. we have around 20 of them now out of our 50 something total chickens. i’m glad you guys got into chickens!
I love anything you post Roman
NOT GOING TO TELL US WHAT?! 😅👀
Love the vlogs whatever you decide to do with your family, I like it laid back. ♥️
Awesome to see your farm. You should ride the horse. Wish could c Noah more loved when he was always with u and ur fam. Glad ur back that’s all that’s important. When u disappeared I had to find another family channel. It was not the same. Now ur back. Love it. Have a good one

I love these type of vlogs 😊 ..... omg Canada needs to get their crap together lol we are still in lockdown and have to wear masks 😷 you guys are so lucky lol
You should do a house tour
This is all entertaining to all of us OGs!!!
You guys need a “keeping up w the Atwood’s” reality show hahahah
Omg!! Tell us about what?????? Why would you do us like that😭😂
Where’s the “if you wanna be with us, you can be with us” merch?
i think it’s good what your doing by i think we all need some normalcy and family vibes  as you would say smile more and be safe

So was the new house a joke or what? I'm confused.
You should get some silky chickens

Love the vlogs no matter what they are! Also Brit with the cliff hanger at the end....
You don’t always have to entertain us. I’ve been watching you since day one, and when you don’t post for weeks it makes me sad! Your true fans enjoy just seeing you and your amazing fam; whatever you’re up to! We love your updates Roman, keep them coming!!! (And more often please) 😊

I’ve been watching for a long time and just watching your videos amuses me anything you’ve done I’ve enjoyed so I’ll watch anything and I think most people feel the same way
No apologies needed, I like the inspiring side of things!
Roman... just remember, life isn't all about just about entertaining people. Even if you just record family fun, you do you... that's what life is supposed to work.
Do what keeps you happy Roman 🙏 we love love love anything you post doesn’t matter how laid back it seems to you we love it💕

My dad also loves flowers he plants the ones that we have. They are some one of his most priced things he won’t let us cut them 😂😂😂
I find it kind of sad they keep talking over romans mom
Hey I just became a dad so you doing dad stuff would be great 😊 👍👍
I’ve loved the vlogs for quite a few years and I plan to keep doing it keep it up
I am 26 yes old and Honestly your videos have helped me throughout the years. Sadly I feel I have hit a dark season to where I want to change careers to have more time to do Christian ministry and family time. But sadly San Diego is too expensive to live in. So lots of decisions to make but I pray and pray and can’t seem to find direction. Your videos inspire me to keep moving forward even tho for you it’s nothing for some of us it’s a goal to reach ! Wish I could talk to ya honestly.
All I got to say is just be you
You should make some costumes smile more crocs I would definitely buy some
Only ogs remember the camo hat...
Loved seeing maw maw she looks great you guys are so lucky to still have her in your life , all my love Tally from Springfield Missouri!
Is your father a Church Bishop?
Why no masks? It's still out there and you have a young family.
i lOVE any time I get to see all of you and know you want to ne here for use But you have to Love the time you have together with family. Love you all Smile More!!!😀😁😉😁😀💓💖💞💖💗
This man always saying sorry man the fk up
Inspire > entertain. Love it man and it s a great way to learn!
Quick question, where is flash?
We love you guys! Wish we would have known that you were interested in more chickens! We sell chicks and full sized chickens and would have 100% driven them up to you! If you are interested in ducks, turkeys or quail let us know! 🥰
I'd love to watch anything you put out. If it's inspiring, entertaining, or even boring rather than nothing at all. I remember when you use to say "you record so you can rewatch these memories and your future grandkids can watch them". So I basically love just keeping up with you guys.   P.s. would love to know what you're doing with the gaming chairs! Been looking for one for some time but would love to purchase a smile more one!
I’m loving  this !!!!
Those final 30sec are awesome
Who paused and just went to the comments? 🙋🏽‍♀️
Maybe you grew out of entertainment like most of your fan base I started watching you when I was 12 and I’m 21 now, maybe your thing is to uplift us now, and help us get through life
Britanys pregnant again I’m calling it Like this comment so y’all can all know I predicted it        Or maybe not.
We have chickens
I have chickens and i love them
Where is flash????
Hey you should get some ducks to go with those chickens
I love being inspired by you
Gotta love rural king
For me, it’s more important to be real then entertaining. You’re doing a great job.
I’m in cincy area we’ve got about 60-100 chickens and we are still hatching them
Roman it's your personality and your families joy that we love to watch,no matter what you are doing, you just need: you, love, family and a camera.
I love all the plants!
Cora is so cute with her own little saying “if you want to be with us then be with us”😂🥺
once the world goes back to the whole no mask mandate thing is gonna feel great
Loving all of this!! Pure joy!! And enjoying life! Gets me out of feeling like a 🧟‍♀️
Family vlogs are entertaining in and of itself, so just keep family vlogging it will be great!
Another banger Roman. thanks, we all love u
You should get a guardian dog for your chickens.
Living in Florida and seeing waiters/waitresses without masks is honestly so uplifting! I feel normal again and not like I'm in a crazy nightmare....
how come no one wearing mask. is Covid19 gone from US and in my country still exist??????
I'm loving all the new family vlogs! I'm going to be getting land someday. I also want a chicken coop!
Only one question where is Flash?
I’m so glad to see grama still doing well..I just cannot believe how big the children have gotten..I really missed this family...God Bless and  be safe..
that ending seemed like a cliffhanger
That's a lot of "Baby" chicks
Why not both ?:) just do what u like Roman , we will support whatever you vlog
We love seeing what your family does, farm stuff is great, We want to see your whole house! We love watching you make rings, shooting guns, off roading, adventures to stores, and awesome no masks in your area!!! Calunicornia (California) won't drop the masks... LAME! The media is the virus! We love you guys!
Where is flash. Hope he is well. Why is he not in the videos.
Don't be surprised if you get one chick that will be friendly. And want to be with one of you.
Good to see your baby smiling and communicating with brother sister.
These vlogs are entertaining i love them and where is flash? SMILE MORE
What about inspirational entertainment 🤔😛 ill watch whatever you post
I have chickens too! We started with five and we’re down to two now :( two of them just got old and one just got taken by a fox a few weeks ago
Always entertaining Rome, maybe less comedy, but always entertaining!
The teaser/cliffhanger thing at the end Roman, come on 😂
Rock tumbling. Cool idea. Show us videos. Look forward to seeing your rock adventure.
3 times a week 👀❤️
Inspiration is what we need in this world I love watching people who inspire people
I think you don’t worry about doing crazy things....just live your life and we love that you include us and let us into it even for a little while.  Thank you.  ❤️Love your WHOLE family and miss your Momma also😢 💔 🙏
It's a new chapter, right? Make it what you want it to be. No need to try to outdo yourself, or anyone else for that matter. Post what you feel comfortable posting, when you feel comfortable posting...I think most people are just happy that you're back.
Honestly Roman you’ve been doing the inspirational pretty much from the start with entertainment as well, I say do what you do.
did you know donkeys are used to protect chickens
It is all  good  roman i love your vlogs
That's way to many dislikes guys. I mean really? What's wrong with you? Lol
You should set up a live camera for the chickens and make a website so we can watch them at anytime.
Love your videos in any format  ❤️🌸🌼🌺💐😝🌻🌿🌷☘️🍀🌴🌳
So crazy to think I’m 18 now I grew up watching you 😂 I’ve been here since under 100k subs like the places you have gone in the years congratulations for real
To Roman Atwood I would stick your videos no matter what for the good or the bad the laid back days or the fun days  You family has meant so much to me it’s a way for me escape reality  Keep doing what your doing my friend  Please give a shout-out I’m AceGamer195
mate you could sit the cam in a corner of the house and just walk around we would watch it as you say to us all if it makes you happy do it so do as you wish mate
Hey Roman, big fan since the beginning :). A small suggestion man, instead of just planting crotons(decorative plants), try planting a few plants/trees which give you some fruit/vegetable. Give it a shot. Appreciate the effort man, take care.
This intro is nice
Honestly this is just the best type of content this is so fine with us Roman 🙏🏾
Roman stay strong we are here for you smile more 👍💪👏👏 keep it up
Inspiration is always best but your in the entertainment business.thats what you tune is I feel u will go in a wrong direction possibly but considering you have long time loyal fans I dont feel it will do much damage to your views and likes. Just do both man. You can always entertain and inspire in the same video. That's your solution 😁
The Sunshine
You be you man, enjoy it, you deserve it, cheers from Canada
We need inspiration in this world❣️
I'm so happy you are on I miss you and your hole family.
just love whatever you vlog! just a few mins with that outro gonna make my day!
Honestly love that you’re so concerned with trying to provide the best content for your viewers but I don’t think you realise just how much we love your ‘laid back content’. While I loved that you were happy when you were making those hour and a half movie style vlogs, some of my favourite videos are a 10 minute vlog when you just talk to the camera. I honestly could listen to you just sharing your thoughts and experiences all day long, you truly are such an inspirational and motivational person :)
Love the old style vlogs
Everytime you turn camera on your entertaining nitro got big keep doing what ur doing looking forward to seeing rocks and chicks xxx
when are we getting an official house tour???
If you get a vibrating rock tumbler it’s much faster. You can finish in a week or less depending on how hard the stone is.
Everyone might not agree with me but this the day in the life , behind the scenes is very entertaining to me.
This is very entertaining to me, I don't mind watching same this video every day!
Love the vids no matter what Atwood's
8:50 — 9:09 Roman 😐😑
I’m actually super interested
I remember when I was little before my mother passed  away at Easter I awlays got to go to the farm and garden store and pick up color dyed chicken and ducks.  Its stuff like this that your kids will always remember. Love you guys you're amazing.
Can someone count how many videos that Roman has made with the word sorry in it🤷‍♂️😂
If you have a chicken for instead of eggs you get money
Love every video
Love the vlogs so much and the new ways you have done you entertainment also love the Atwood family........ But we’re not gonna talk about how he kepts the last clip of Brit saying that in like hello what is it what’s the big secret your keeping from us.......
Literally no one cares. Lame AF. Wack AF.
Seriously, you are such a ******* *********.
You’re always entertaining and inspiring Roman! Love the casual vlogs 😌
I love both forms of content either way you cant go wrong
Please please keep making vlogs like these. These are just as incredible and entertaining as jumping into an icy pond.
Man, don’t even. You’ve been entertaining us with sick content since the day you started YouTube. Now you’re a legend, and always, always, be entertaining no matter what. ✨
Thank you for apoligizing.
Don’t say sorry you are just doing your job being the best daddy and husband anybody could ask for! My family loved the vlog today! Love you guys! Family First! ❤️
Family vlogs are great. Update us about the whole family ( dad, brother etc)
Tell us what Roman ??? Cmon man I haven’t seen you in a year and you leave me like that
H ow Many Sorry have you said this year?2021
Just seeing you and letting me know how your doing makes me happy!!  Just do what makes YOU happy Roman and I’ll watch!! ❤️❤️
I love watching anything you all do...you inspire me to do better and more with my daughter...Thank you!!
dude on all my bad days, I watch these vlogs and i swear it just makes it better.  I dont know how or why, it just does.  keep doing you bro
Yes your videos were always entertaining, but it was the uplifting that caused me to come back and keep watching and to share.  So if uplifting is where you are, at this point of your life, then for sure, keep uplifting!! Much Love.. Fan from the beginning
I like this
that look roman makes @ 9:08 its priceless...lol
I’ll be here ever always love ya all
When’s the house tour coming?
I love it when you just hit record and take us with you wherever you go. Laid-back family vlogs are the best.
You could set up a camera and not say a word, and we would watch. We genuinely love you. No matter what. No. Matter. What.
WAit what are you not telling us 🙃😂
Hey I’m at a point my life when I could use more inspiration than entertainment meant anyways so go for it!
If it's a chill vlog, it's entertaining.. if it's inspirational, it's entertaining.. everyday life, it's entertaining.. simply it's just entertaining no matter the content!
I love these types of videos were you aren’t worried about entertainment but just going about your day.
You get what you get somethings better than nothing
money didn’t change him it changed the way he lived and from now i have a felling he won’t do anything fun anymore idk maybe
Get a goose to put with the chickens. They are like feathered guard dogs. Also, I much rather have these types of relaxing vlogs.
man i just need more vlogs like this. just do you! :) any kind of a video from you is a blessing
This is very entertaining. Love the day blogs
Sun is my fav
i loved watching you ty for the energy
Brother you do you and the family I’ll keep watching
I don’t care about what u do really it’s fun to watch
what your having a nether baby cool you sad it not me Britany atwood
Both do both.
Keep baby chicks about 80 degrees for about 4 weeks and then slowly lift the lamp each week, dropping around 3 degrees daily until they reach about 6 weeks or are fully feathered.. then you can set them out...!
i wish i had a dad like you
Vistiņu cilvēks 👌
Where’s Noah
love the trip vlogs
We just got chickens a few days ago for the first time... we also got two geese.... they’re so cute. We have them under the heat keeping them nice and warm
LLM🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽
This is entertaining  Trust me
Holy crap its maw maw
Yes make videos forever no matter what it is.

You need to live stream the chickens
Where is flash?
Random question but why arent they all wearing masks?  Its your choice if you dont wanna wear them just wanna know out of curiosity :)   Awesome Vlog as always!!
This is what I love about you guys you show what your day your always entertaining even tho it’s normal day stuff to you guys it’s amazing to us you don’t always gotta do crazy stuff to post these are one of my favorite type of vlogs keep it up Roman😎!
My family used to have 200 chickens that was fun
we need a tour
Just seeing your faces pop up for a new vlog makes any day better for me! You are always uplifting and it’s like being apart of the family ❤️
Im unsubscribing. Go back to the beginning when it was fun to see you pulling pranks on cops.
Fuck masks!!!
I have to stick around to the end because I like her in the smile more part because it brings me up you’re beautiful you’re one-of-a-kind smile more
Roman, don’t apologize to us. Your just a person, we all have crap in our lives at times. Btw, this video was still entertaining. Just filming what you guys do is enjoyable!
Love my chickens, I have 12 Rhoade Island Reds.
It was funny when Roman played with the airhorn and mama said a bad word and Roman played the airhorn at same time to cover it up by accident
I've got 20 chickens in a homemade coop that is propable the world's coolest chicken coop.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Where is Flash ???
I’m inspired and entertained 😁 @TheShedDealer Nice shed❗️
The spot they are rolling check for eggs. That’s a nesting spot possibly
Love chickens! My girlfriend and I started with 12 chickens and 3 ducks, we now have 4 chickens and 3 ducks. And in the next couple of weeks we will have chickens and 8 ducks
me i like whatching you every day i dont care what you do
I love all of your vlogs! They are always entertaining to watch
I feel like Roman and Brit should get goats or maybe pigs?
Just wanna see daily life normal vlogs no need for monstertrucks crushing cars and crap just live life and thats inspiering enough for me
I have two chickens named Toto and Tammy!
I will just say you do you Roman we always gonna enjoy what ever you post it's inspiration and entertaining at the same time.❤️❤️❤️
A while back you said you vlog so you can look back on you past we will always be here because most of us have really benefited from you so we look at you as a reminder that we can do it because you taught us that it was possible
It doesn’t matter if your content is entertaining or not (I always think it is) or inspiring or not (again it always is) but we will watch whatever YOU want to film! Go Roman!!! I am loving watching you all I can’t get enough of you guys now that you’re back :))))
you got me watching you while i eat so you know it’s entertaining
WHERES FLASH!!!!
These vlogs are entertaining.
The part about how we often feel stuck or like we will always be in this place forever was a great reminder for me right now
So good to see mamaw again. Did she have surgery? Hope she heals fast. 🙏🏻
It’s interesting and inspiring and entertaining just keep doing what you want and that’s that ! We love your family ! Crazy chicken lady friend 💜💜💜
This is actually really entertaining this is you and all like seeing you being like this
Fun Fact, chickens take something called dirt baths where they LITERALLY roll around in the dirt all day.
I think the family vlogs are the most entertaining
Andrew flair has a whole farm he isn’t old lol
Please stop putting so much pressure on yourselves. We love all your content because of who you all are, not what you do per video! Thanks for always being so genuine. Even with all of your fame and success, you’ve never changed.
These calm type vlogs were always my favorite and always will
I have 100 chickens I love them too !!!! I sell a lot of eggs to co workers fresh is the best
I wish you guys would get back to daily vlogs😍
Y’all need to get some heating lamps for those chicks. I work at a tractor supply out here where I live. And in each of our baby chicken coops we keep at least one heating lamp on. Just some little tid bit of advice 😊
I love this video.. keep them coming .. I want a farm so more video will be good so I can learn more

Love just watching your family with whatever you do!
Your so Entertaining to be honest😇!!
Roman. I’ve lived on a farm for 21 years. Get a Great Pyrenees witch is a live stock guardian. They will protect your chickens against any predators. The Great Pyrenees is bred to take on bears and wolves. They are also great with kids. But If you’re interested I can give you more information and insight If you want.
I love anything that you put out. I love your family so much!
Justin Rhodes has the best chicken content.  Check him out!
Maybe start with every 2 days
life usually gets in the way, it's easier just saying that you will film, but wirh life and family coming first i understand if you dont

But you’ve been doing it and the real ones know your awesome. Just some inspiration talk from a long time supporter 😊✌🏽
Roman even if you go out side and dig a hole a film it I will still watch it and laugh at it keep doing what your doing
Could she possibly be pregnant again? LOL. That last couple seconds was sus af
He always feels so genuine and gives me hope that the world still has genuine people in it. Hes very inspiring!

Just know you and your family are always in our thoughts and our prayers no matter what.  Your mom's anniversary in Heaven this month, my mom's anniversary in Heaven this month - Hugs!
Trust me i am 19 year's old and this is still entertaining
True fans will love your videos
Yoooo
Jesus is King! If you do not know Jesus as Savior please pray, “ Jesus save me. At this moment I choose to have faith that You gave Your life for me and rose from the dead. Doing this You defeated death, even though it meant You had to die. You surrendered Your life for me, so I chose to surrender my life to You. Forgive me Jesus, my God. Amen.”  Jesus loves you so much. Please accept His love. I encourage you to read the Bible and pray.   “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and a only Son, that whoever believes that in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” John 3:16  🙏❤️🙏  Jesus is enough!  Again I tell you, Jesus loves you!
Don’t apologize. You don’t need to entertain or inspire me. I just want to hangout with you and the family. Much love
I'll always support you Roman no matter what you are doing
You want to be inspiring just in this video you inspired me several time just in a few seconds with a couple sentences if you make a video and have a new different sentence in it that is inspiring then you would achieve your goal
Yessss moreeee inspiration
These are the vlogs I love the most!!
i’m never going anywhere
...tell us about what??!?
Your video are always good
The laid back family day to day life vlogs are what I enjoy watching.
You need to stop apologizing. We love you and your family and that’s why we come back!
Everything is entertaining! I watch your videos when I'm ready to relax! I LOVE the farm stuff. That is something I've always wanted to do since I was little, and I still plan on it some day!!
watching you and ur family is enough. just do what makes you happy. its always a pleasure to watch
The cashier definitely didn't pass the vibe check
Do what you feel like doing and we will follow. Your life your choice and we will always watch and follow you
Where is your dad? We wanna see him
We’ve grown too. We are entertained by this.
These vlogs ARE entertaining. They’re always entertaining. You don’t need to go over the top. Those are for when you’re inspired to do something crazy. But we’re here for all the vlogs.
Hey Roman when the chickens are doing that in the dirt they are giving themselves a dirt bath and making there wings more water proof. Just some food for thought
I have 12 chickens and get 10 eggs a day. I might get more soon!
You and your family are so enjoying to watch!
Your personality is our entertainment. It shines like the sun on your hat! 🌞 👍🏻 Keep smiling!
I love your vlogs‼️ I check every other day just to see if there's a new one
Family over everything. Don't worry to much on entertainment man, most of us aren't here for that. If it happens thats a bonus.
Don’t Blink by Kenny Chesney
Well I always like the daily life that you feel is boring.  I want chickens, ducks and goats. Your positive viewers, will always LOVE your content
No matter what it is, we wanna see it!!

Wheres flash 🥺

I never came to to the channel to be entertained ... But I always came because you are an inspiration to me and millions . Roman Never apologize because you and your family have given so much to the world and it's a better place because of it ...
My favorite hat is the sun! It's bright and happy!!

Leaves of 3 let them be leaves of 4 eat some more
💞If you are reading this:💕💕💕💞BE BLESSED WITH AN AWESOME LIFE!!!!    x   1,000,000 !!!!💞💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Ill watch you not do nothing in the vlog just love your family felt weird not seeing a vlog for a few weeks. 😪 But now my day is better. Hes doing good just being a family and a dad!  I live by one rule always think positive great to see yall!  We are with you no matter what,  just keep bein you
If you have the room I would definitely suggest getting some chickens they are very affordable and use full at the same time
I think we all love to just see you guys doesn’t matter just pick up the camera for us
I absolutely enjoy seeing your every-day life with your family you will always be entertaining
Lol love the ending
Just do the regular family vlogs!! It’s entertaining and no matter what you always say something that inspires me 💙 we all love you and your family and just want to see that y’all are happy because you w made us happy for so many years
Yo where flash at?????
Ur goal isn't entertaining but I was left entertained
Your regular day to day life is what I started watching years ago. Skip the entertainment and just the raw real moments of YOUR life! THAT is what us OGs remember and have stuck around for!
U r good I want u to care about your family and yourself first before us FAMILY MORE IMPORTANT THAN US DONT FEEL SORRY
Every vid is entertaining
Next live things you get bee hives.
Get a fram dog so nothing eats them
The Atwood's could literally do anything and it be entertaining. Glad to have y'all back on YouTube!!💯
I missed your fam
I like the inspiration. I am 16 and I need the inspriration
I get the whole positivity thing you are trying to do with your merch but...I would love to see a skull and crossbones smile more design. Skulls can be a positive happy design...look at The Grateful Dead and their use of skulls & skeleton graphics. If you want I can work up a design for you...kind of in need of work. Peace!
We got chickens last year, and they are so therapeutic! I can't believe how attached we all are.... To CHICKENS. Lol. All my friends got them too and we are just all crazy chicken ladies. And we love that we don't have to buy eggs ever, and love gifting them all the time to our friends and coworkers. So I totally relate to yall!
I got eight chickens
Where is the Gtr ?
If you think you're chickens and donkeys and maybe goats won't be entertaining, you should check out Lumnah Acres videos on youtube.  They raise their animals on the farm vlogs and get tons of views every day.  Your people will certainly watch whatever you put out
Can you do flat rimmed hat  versions
I am a much older viewer and I love the inspiring family videos!! Thanks Atwood family for sharing a little of your lives with us, o and btw it was great to see mawmaw! Hope her arm heals fast!!
I think the inspiration is just as important as the entertainment aspect.   People now days need more inspiration than ever before.  Keep it up Atwood's
I enjoy anything you want to blog. I enjoy your family and seeing what all you are up to. Keep up the good work.
No matter what the content is, I’ll be watching you guys. Love your family and the vibes you give out. Definitely lifts me up !!!!
Honestly whatever you guys do is inspiring and entertaining. Do what’s best for you guys💕
ive always loved the more "homey" vlogs more than the crazy production or big stunts - love seeing the family and daily activities <3
Are you from USA
We need Rc cars
Loving your stuff no matter how long!
They were choosing the chickens like they were donuts 😂
I have 8 chickens! I started with 10, but two gotten killed by foxes. It’s so much fun getting them as baby chicks and watching them grow! So easy to take care of & the fresh eggs are amazing!! 😄
Honestly you are definitely on a different chapter in your life with your family and to some this might not seem entertaining but to most of us that grew up watching these vlogs and are in different points in our lives as well these daily life laid back style type of vlogs is what we want to watch. But anything with you inspiring us to do better in our lives and your family just living life is always an awesome video so don’t even stress about it Roman! 🙏🏼❤️
What a cliff hanger! 😂
Maybe I forgot but what happened to Flash??
You have to get a rooster to get babies
Shots fired! Roman’s callin Matt Carriker old haha
You can do hour and a half next family vacation.
One of the only social media stars with 15 mil subs that still goes out in public or to the store without security. Awesome! Or is mama their security 🤔
I have been watching since day one and will always continue to watch
It’s entertaining! We also love chickens.
For the past year+ it's been apology videos about the content and I don't understand why. People clearly enjoy your vlogs
Loveee the vlog! and I'm assuming they lifted the mask mandate? so luckyyyy Im in Ontario and were still on lockdownnnnn UGHHHH
Please do a full chicken tour video! Chickens are amazing pets. We have 14 right now. 🥰🥰🥰🥰
You are always entertaining Roman and you always will be <3
cora you're so adorable. too cute  to ignore this little gem  😊😍
House tour!
We have chickens! We turned out playset into a chicken coop as all of us kids are older now. We have 8 chickens 6 grown and two babies at the moment. We sadly lost one of our adults just a month back. My grandparents also have a farm and have chickens so before we got chickens last year we had farm fresh eggs. I can tell the difference between store-bought and fresh and I can never go back to store-bought.  It also doesn't matter what you do I love watching you guys and your daily lives. You always brighten up my days. <3
What happened to Clifford
atwood family is my childhood 😸
My mom got the Covid Shots, still wears mask in stores because there is chance she could still get it.That and alot of places still require it... but she said she would still wear it either way for now.
Farm Vlogs are more entertaining than you think. I have 3 beautiful chickens that I adore nothing better than fresh eggs Hello from Australia
Who remembers when Roman use to love vloging an it wasnt just make a vlog to plug my new hat! ... Not the same as the old vlogs at all IMO!
it's ok
The hat with the blue balloon hits different 🔥💯
Bro I am starting High school in two months
I love the chicks!
Cora's little squeel at the beginning when Roman chased her was too wholesome.
We've got 20 little chickens today!
Will watch anything and everything you post. Love you guys so much
Tell Us lol
My favorite vlogs are the family vlogs. I love seeing what you guys are doing and how the family is growing.
I love this
You’re inspiring from your work, keep it up! Love the content. Would love to see more day to day, watching u guys grow is insane. Love it
bro @907
I enjoy the family vlogs and the fun things. A mix of both is the best I think. Also “leaves of 3 let them be. Orrrr stomp on them” haha. So great
The entertainment vlogs are cool, but I enjoy the everyday family vlogs just as much
I learn so much about life and being human listening to Roman talk
I’ve always loved these vlogs ever since I was 12 watching you and you would always apologize and say “ sorry we didn’t do much today” but these are my favorite wholesome vlogs and I’m 17 now
I love your videos!
Chickens everywhere
This made my day and brightened it so much
This is entertaining. You dont gotta do pranks. Show interesting things your doing. Behind the scenes of the atwoods. We all will learn, be inspired and grow together. <3 And always Hit that like button.
I like where your head it at. I look to YouTube to be inspired and motivated to push myself to get to that point in life that I see of the channels I admire
whats going on with the gtrs?
Always love the family vlogs!
Your doing good. Always entertaining no matter what.
Your doing good. Always entertaining no matter what.
Just live anything you do!
I am an egg farmer looking for a investor
I personally love these kinds of videos you do- the chill, doing your own day-to-day thing, and no matter what your videos do inspire and make me (and I'm sure many others) happy. If you don't feel like doing as much entertainment vids that's completely fine, you do what is authentic and that's what's going to be truly worth it- otherwise if you make videos that you aren't 100% happy with, it would feel more like a chore than a passion. And you definitely didn't need to apologise one bit! Us supporters will always stay by your side and we totally get it😊 Take your time and take care
Remember the hour long mail vlogs?
Me🙋🏼‍♀️ I have chickens!! Chickens dig holes as a “dust bath,” it is a way of cooking them off. I am soo glad my boyfriend introduced me to your channel!!
That ending was perfection! The tease and then the chicks just doing there thing with the red glow and the rustling of their little feet! Great job!
Love you romannnn
Roman, we just love you and your family.  Be yourself, like you encourage us to do.  Those who love you will always watch.
Did u tell her about them😢😳😂🤣
We love you guys
I love these vlogs! Were not here to only see your pranks and crazy stunt videos. We love you Atwood's! So everything you guys are willing to show us, whether it be high intensity crazy videos, or just buying some chick's and showing us how much enjoyment YOU guys are having on your new journey.  Sometimes to be able to just sit down and watch someone else living there life can be a great way for one to escape mental health battles, struggles or stress. 💞
Film whatever makes you happy. We will enjoy it no matter what. I prefer the family stuff anyways.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS ISNT ENTERTAINING I LOVE IT!!!!! SUPER ENTERTAINING KEEP DOING THIS
No one cares boo hoo!
The part looking for chickens reminded me of the last time they went to the dog shelter. We all know what happened next.
I just love watching you and your family. You can do anything and I’ll still watch 😊 the vlogs of your daily routines are totally great! I miss watching you every day. I know it’s a lot of work.I love you guys! 💜💜
Just keep doing what your doing,and we will keep on watching bro
12:20 the name of her shirt is off😕
Personally i love just normal family vlogs. Just like walking into a friends house, and catching up. I don't need special "extras" Just be yourselves   :-))

Being able to watch your daily life is always entertaining no matter what you decide to do.
I have some chicken and have eggs incubating now.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
For me your style of entertainment has always been inspiring. Please stick with what you've done best.
My favorite is the sun and the balloon
Hey Roman! I named my cat after Nitro, he looks just like him and I thought of you guys when I first saw him, so we named him Nitro
I personally love just the family vlogs where you see the real stuff that happens even if its not the most exciting, its a comfort thing since ive been watching you guys for so long, its like ive grown up with you guys
These are the kind of blogs I like!
I'm always down for any Atwood family content!!!! I love the entertainment but honestly enjoy the day to day vlogs more!!!!! Love y'all keep inspiring! You guys rock!
We are always with you roman. Anytime you film we are entertained.
Day 9: Where is Flash?
"Atwood Family Farm Vlogs and more" sounds catchy.... hope the rope and toy company is going well
Love my chickens!!  So much fun.
I love seeing your family life
Please do a q&a think that would be great for everyone to catch up  :)
Just watching you is entertaining
Your always entertaining roman no matter what you do all of the Atwood armies will agree we love  Watching you and your family grow.  But one thing we all probably want to see is a big fan mail video again.
Who remembers the camo smile more hat
Anything is entertaining with you guys,I think that the world could use some Inspiration anyways
I had 8 chickens then they got eaten so we got 6 more
First off... y’all have ALWAYS been inspiring, also... THIS IS entertaining 💕✨ we love just y’all presents
How come they aren’t wearing a mask in the shop? Do you not need to in America anymore?
you don’t have to apologize
wow a new video is it 2022 already?
Bardrock are amazing and the americana chick's lay colored eggs. We have 4 chickens and get 4 eggs a day
Get goats!!!! They are the best!!!! And then you can do goat yoga :)
Positivity is the best kind of entertainment some of us are here for something positive in the crazy world we live in .. so thank u a lot for just being u SMILE MORE
Dude thanks right back at you!!
We’re is flash at?
Why is no one answering the question “Where is Flash?”
Missed you maw maw
Love whatever you do
I love you romen thank u for helping me get trew so much u have been my bigest insperation. love u dude
Love the chickens y’all have 💪🏼 I have almost 100 birds and counting, it’s really nice to have fresh eggs, even tho I get almost 3 dozen a day lol, love the farm bro 🤙🏼
For me I love just seeing you and your family because yall lift me up when im down so anything recorded even your regular life is fine people like me never seen things you have or do love you roman much love ❤
Why can't you have fun.. and inspire doing both should not be too hard right!!.. 🤔😊
You are always entertaining and inspiring just keep making videos even if it's one a week. Y'all always make my day ,week, month and year
Love the Vlog/family/farmette update. Seems like y'all are getting a lesson in "chicken math" hahhaha. We have 23 chickens, 2 goats and a dog on our little farmette. The chickens were just dust bathing they do it to keep mites and other parasites away. Feel free to ask questions if you have any. No Pro but been living the family farm lifestyle for a bit as well. God Bless
You have to get back to the original reason for vlogging. You wanted to vlog to capture and save the memories for the family when you all get older. Think back to your first vlog. You didn’t start vlogging to be entertaining you started vlogging to save your memories. And we would watch your Vlogs because we thought your everyday life was entertaining.
I thoroughly enjoy these kind of vlogs rather than you trying to push for entertainment! Much love!
Does tatter wha you film it’s always inspiring....you are so awesome just keep dong it.   I’m a 71 year old woman from Ontario and you are one of my favourites.   My friend just told me she bought me one of you smile more t-shirts and I can’t wait to get it.  ❤️
Hi Roman I’m a fan of you from the Philippines 🇵🇭 you’re YouTube videos are so awesome and so inspiring keep it up!
I love these types of videos! Anything is entertaining with you guys.
I love the sun hat
You’re doing amazing Roman! Please keep inspiring us. We are all so involved with you life, anything is entertaining to us. I would love to learn from you. Keep posting man, I need it. We need it!
Rural king is the greatest store
Dude, this calm happy day-to-day is what I'm here for! You're plenty "entertaining"! Don't worry about it!
I need more chicken videos I need help with knowing how to take good care of the baby chicks because mine aren’t doing to well
I think it’s definitely inspiring to most
I am here forever rom
No covid there roman? Whrre’s the mask?? Just wondering. Stay safe man
I've got about 55 chickens
Everything you do is entertaining keep doing this!
TELL US ABOUT WHAT?!?!?!?!?!? ROMAN!!!!!!!
Where’s flash?
I bet all the Liberals were shocked that romanatwood a gun lover republican wasn't wearing a mask in the store
Love you guys!! From Athens, GA
I love your vids there both inspirational and entertaining! Although I would LOVE to see some mudding and off-roading vids 👍
You guys are doing what we do daily! Chickens, goats, rocks and homeschool!
I used to watch you guys eat slices of hotdogs and I was entertained. Anything you do is entertaining
Bro do you like classic cars  then buy one
Just do what you are saying you are going to do instead of talking about it.  If you want to film, film, if you don't want to then don't.  If you want to spend time with the family, then do it.  We don't need to hear about it.  WE also have families and you should be happy that we are watching your video and supplying you with an income, because I am sure ALOT of us watch your videos when we could be spending time with our families.  I just get tired of hearing excuses all the time why you DIDN'T vlog.  There are ALOT of videos I look forward to watching every week, because I know they will be there, but with yours, if it is there when I open up YT then I will watch, if it isn't I have LOTS of other vlogs I can watch, but to be honest, I don't get on here everyday looking to see if you put a vlog up or not.  You might be inspiring to the younger kids and people on here, but yeah not with me.  You are kinda just a little all over the place.
Buy ranch bro that would be sick
It is very entertaining to us my family. We love animals and your videos.
I love any and all content you put out! Vlogs, Tik Toks, Even just your daily Instagram Posts, Please keep posting, it brings a lot of happiness to my life :) Smile More!
Your having another kid?
I could sit here all day just watching vlogs like this💙
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I was very interested in the chicks 🐥 and would like to learn the process how it works. It’s nice seeing you change your content.
We love our chickens and now have goats.
Roman and his fam bring light to everyone's day
We had 20 chickens and coyotes ate 10 of them. So we got 12 more chicks. We also have 6 goats, 2 horses, and 4 dogs. It’s crazy
Don't script it..  Life is unscripted. Live it, love it, embrace it.  but I would love for you to show weekly chick updates so you can share how fast they grow and how fun they are.. also . cook up some double yolkers!  so fun!
Love these type of videos
I have almost 100 so i know the chicken grinde
Farmer Roman is the only logical progression for his career at this point.
Roman whatever content you put out is going to make millions of people happy, me included.
Um, tell us WHAT???? Don't leave us hanging like that, man!
Where is flash .....?......
Its called growing up .  The stunts and stuff  are only cute to  most  for  a short time.     At least it should be.  Plus at a certain age the body can t hold up to it anymore.  No need to be sorry.
We have a .25 acre property with chickens!
You entertaine and inspire💕💕
Any blog you post makes my day! I look everyday after school to see if you post also!!!
We all LOVE yall
I enjoyed having chickens years ago. My only problem with them was they tend to scatter their feed all over and then it draws rats.
This is fun to watch
It was entertaing u like hearing your plans for the future and the complex stuff
Just seeing you guys is entertaining ♥️
The masks can go to hell
Some of your best videos are just family vlogs.
I am here to watch The Atwood Family. Regardless of what im watching, absolutely love and support you and your family as a whole ❤
You always entertain no matter what it is I always look forward to the videos no matter what. If you just did a normal day family vlog that’s ok. If you do an entertaining video that’s also ok you just inspire me to push and do better thank you to the whole family. SMILE MORE!!!
Roman you should get into stained glass
Where is flash?!?!
Roman Atwood one thing you do not do is spread hate rather use for a good smile more baby
Where i am we still have to wear a mask. We can't go out for dinner because all food places are shut down. Wish I was there.
Where’s flash at
Cora is such a bonnie wee lass.  "If you want to be with us, then be with us."  God bless the Atwood's.
Roman:it’s like going to an ice place there so many flavors here. OMG!!😂😂😂😂😂
I have 25 acres of land I have chickens 🐓 and I like chicken nuggets
Your the best Roman keep going
Sometimes life gets in the way, we get lost in our thoughts and it takes time to refocus. Trust me I understand. Bed of luck to you and your family, keep up the great work!
Roman is like f that rainbow lmao
YALL REALLY SAID CLIFF HANGER🥺
Where is the house tour?
i wish those hats were the same quality as the camo trucker. thats my fav hat, i wear it everywhere.
Yup
I think it would be awesome if you set up a live chicken cam for us to watch 24/7,  to watch them grow and play... Now that's chickens all the time. But that's just me.
I love vloggs like this, just real life everyday stuff, also would love a house and yard tour
I have never seen you as an entertainer. It’s always been inspiration to me.
Anything he posts is the best content
Do what you enjoy doing the viewers will come with time
Absolutely love this video.  Chickens.  Baby.  Rocks.  Just so real and raw - breathtaking  P.s. amazing pot plant
Do you live in a new house or what?

I love this kind of vlogs !
Gfuel
Loving the vlogs!!!! Y’all are always entertaining!!!!

Bro Roman no matter what you will always have you're real ones please keep you're head up! I love these baby chickens!! I've always wanted to own baby chickens and donkeys!! Man you are living the life!!
Rich people problems.
9:05 When your mom tells you to do the dishes after you just finished eating...
I have chickens there awesome
I would love to get to this point someday, I want more than anything to have a beautiful family, some land, and a miniature farm like this with some useful animals like chickens and pigs.
Start a GoPro on the donkeys or chicken. Let’s see their daily routine lol
Any vlog is a good vlog! Dont need to be filled with pranks or big extravagant things. Seeing u guys is entertaining enough
Honestly... you don’t even have to entertain me. I just love supporting you and the fam. Been watching for too long to skip out now. Love
Anyone else looking forward to the secrets at the end. ?
Why don't you respond to comments of we're with you?
I love the farm stuff. Definitely inspiring
When you were doing pranks. That was entertaining, when you were having the craziest days. That was entertaining. Now that you are just wondering that is entertaining. You are THE ATWOOD FAMILY. YOU ARE ENTERTAINMENT. I come to watch what you do. And what you do is entertainment, so do you. Stop apologizing to us.
I have chickens🙋🐔
Why haven't we seen flash??
I have chickens and also currently raising turkeys chicks
Legend
I have 6 chickens haha
The place I work ( Tyson foods ), I work with baby chicks every day and we send out about 2.4 million ( I think ) baby chicks.
Vehicle update
Happy to watch anything...thank you for letting us into your awesome life. Xoxoo
I like the 15 minute vlogs
If you like honey maybe build a bee hive as the next project
I or should I say my parents have 9 roosters , 20 chickens, 29 baby chicks and eggs also everyday in our backyard. When they roll in the dirt they are showering that’s how chickens showers lol 🤣
y’all are like family so to me it’s just nice to see y’all no matter what is going on 💞
I've missed just basically seeing your life and the one on ones, inspirational and entertaining my man! Thank you for all you've done!
Zane has some awesome merchandise on and he has a awesome keyboard from Unspeakable 😎😱
U should do another movie
Anyone wonder what happened to flash
I’ve been watching you for years and I’m so ecstatic that you and your family are back after some personal life issues! I’m hoping you guys do a huge firework show for Memorial Day weekend as we just did for may 24 here in Canada!
rainbow one for pride month!!!
Let you faith in Jesus be known Roman.
Entertaining for us is seeing you and your family. Would love catch ups with dad, brothers etc.
my parents have chickens
Went From 😀 To 😐 9:05
What was in the box at 5:25?
Inspiring is the best it makes people smile more and help others that need it or just love watching you’re videos
😂I don‘t think we have a Shop like that in Germany. They sell sandals and so many different chicken 😍 gosh they are cute!
You're videos are both entertaining and inspirational whether you're trying to entertain/inspire us or not.
Great seeing all of you but a special treat seeing maw maw back
When are you collabing with @FazeRug ?!?!
more of these please ❤
Hi
Your everyday life IS entertaining lol
This was a perfect vlog! Love the chill family style 👌 coming from a 40 yr old that’s been watching you since the beginning
You’re definitely entertaining Roman 💖 I love you guys 💖💖💖
Just watching u is cool
Tell us about what?!??!!?😦 19:33
Brit: Yes, kids, let's have more kids! Roman: (the "are-you-kidding-me?" look)
What happened to flash and the donkeys
I don't have any chickens but i do have Muscovy ducks ♥ lots of fun!
Why was this video really entertaining though
What happened to flash?
I like the heart hat
I’m back to get chickens in 5 de
100% just do what you do....love the entertaining stunts and trips but if you share your day to day life too then I, along with most I assume, will be there for that journey too!! Smile More!!
Your entrainment was and is inspiring Roman! Really appreciate you and will always watch. But we like to see whatever going on or hearing about whatever!   You tell great stories!   Hope the Atwood family is well!
Tell us what?!?!
Between Cora screaming at the beginning and the chicks in the store, this is not a video for headphones
These are the videos we wanted
I love all your vlogs no matter what!
I love all ur videos an raw vlogs
Tell us about what?!? 😅
I don’t think Roman really understands his true followers, just doing what u are doing is entertaining for us because we just love u and your family. We don’t need a crazy video those just bring in fandoms but they are good for you too
anyone else notice the intro sound 🤭
No more rccars 😭
What now
You have done both! Entertained  me and inspired me, no matter what video you do.. I started my merch bran, because  of yall! And more.  Also you have kept me going ( entertained  me ) always, as well!  Much luv ysll!
Uplifting is better for me then the entertainment aspect of it. Smile more. These videos inspire me.
Love the new intro
Come on man you don’t need to apologize we are all human we all get unmotivated for whatever reason
I live on a farm
Always love the videos!
Why won't you incubate your chicken eggs if you have a rooster
I like what you did with the chicks at the end of the video
TELL US ABOUT WHAT?!?!?! 😂
U always entertaining me wit all ur videos
If you making  videos, it inspires, it reaches  I out.  Dude I'm 44.   Been a with ya for yrs.  ITS ALWAYS A  POSITIVE VIBE Watching!!  I think ya need to do a family  BBQ vlog!!  Chance.
My family just wants you and your family happy. We don't care what you choose to do. As long as there are opportunities for us to come along we will be there with you. You have shown us your heart and ot sure is a beautiful one. So when or if you choose you are done when the time comes my family wishes yall pure happiness from the bottom of our hearts. Here till the end always xoxo
This is better. Vlog like this. You don’t need to try and entertain anyone this is what we love.
Bro admit it your focus is to sell new product and its that simple.
I missed you glad to see you and your family are well I love you guys you entertain me no matter what you are doing I have chickens as well and one peacock 🦚 we used to let them out of there pen until one night I forgot to lock them back up and a fox 🦊 got two of them well took the heads and left the carcass cause they couldn’t take through the fence
Just a idea for your Smile More Store. You guys should start  a gym. Then you would help lifted people up and make them fell better about them self.  Maybe sale your Smile More  stuff at the gym to help your business then you guys can parted with G-fule to help sale there drink.  SMILE MORE GYM!
Dont get me wrong, you are very entertaining and I enjoy it. But if i choose, i would choose inspiration over entertainment all day long. Your channel has been truly inspiring, radiating positivity and pulled a lot of people including me through some tough times. Love the content. If it was up to me, every single vlog would be just you hanging out with your family, the "old school family vlog" style :)
I miss the old vlogs when you would drive Noah to school and then go drop off merch at the post office😂 You would always get deep on the way to the post office. Miss the inspiration
I like raw videos ❤️
Cheeky ending!
Do whatever makes you happy my guy👍🏼
You guys should totally try to hatch some
How is your dad doing?
Tell us about what?
Roman dont worry! We are always here and forever will be excited for a vlog. Long time viewer since about 2015 :) Love your work man
19:36 Nobody: Brit: Wait are we not gonna tell them about  Roman: what ... Nobody says anything Me: OMG ARE YALL KIDDING ME?
maybe a Monday, wed., Friday schedule would work better for ya. 3 days a week and weekends off sounds like a great idea.
You’re entertaining us buy just bringing us with you. Your company is what we want more than anything. Wishing you and your family the best.
Yess movies
We need a house tour.
I honestly I love the wholesome family vlog style like this one today. The people that love y’all are always going to find y’all’s videos entertaining in some form or another even if they’re like the one today where you think it’s not entertaining.❤️🖤❤️🖤
GUYS ARE YALL NOT NOTICING WHAT BRIT SAID AT THE ENDDDDDD 😅 what are y’all gonna tell us!!
Dude, you entertained me for about 20min and 2sec :)
Cora and brit are twins
Wait tell us what? LOL noooo tell us LOL any video is entertaining love watching you guys
I love these kind of vlogs, they are awesome. Keep up the awesome work
Anything you post is entertaining I love all your videos
I’m loving the Atwood farm stuff! We gotta get in touch and do some cool animal stuff😎
I thought ma mal took a dirt nap y’all ain’t included her long time
Bro just film your day, that’s all I’ve been wanting since the day u started to daily vlog years ago, I was down to watch your salt water tank 24/7 when u said u wanted to stream it😂 sit and don’t talk or just  walk around & I will still watch😂
That is my favorite store
"Suckers Alley!" That is so true LOL!🤣🤣  How can you not fall in love with those little things....and when they have ducks.....game over.
Grandma has a cast??? :/
Hi romane no problème
WHY ARENT YALL WEARING MASKS
You're always entertaining
4 hours ago      i have chickens and we are going to get more
I love u roman and was on ur live today and ur content is the best
The vlogs have always been entertaining and inspiring. I have been a fan for quite a few years now and it has always been insperational and entertaining no matter what kind of vlog it has been it always has the same positive energy somewhere in the vlog.
Brit: you’re not going to tell them  Roman: what?  Brit: you knowww Roman:**silence** *****video cuts off******  Me: 😧😧😧😦😦😦😦😦!!!!!!!
I prefer the raw family vlogs 100%!!
No fear Mr. Atwood you’re always inspiring and entertaining
Heyy Roman if u want more chickens I have some really cool chicken there really hairy and cool hit me up if u want one
Tells us what?? You make me smile every time. 💜
Don't think just record. You inspire us even if it is just every day stuff. It is enough to give me a smile.
I’ve bin watching since 2015
I think I speak for everyone when I say, we don't watch your videos for the stuff you do as, "entertainment" and just that alone. I can say, no matter what your doing as long as you are posting and even just talking we will be entertained. You guys in general are the entertainment, seeing the family alone makes peoples days. You can do whatever and we will still watch and be just as entertained as we were on our first days watching. Been watching sense I was 14 and nothing has changed for me, I'm now 20. Much love to the family :)
In Kane’s terrarium he should have a crab
roman things happen in life and sometimes you have to do what is best for you and your family and take a step back and share moments together that are special to you and your family and only for you guys, it doesnt make you a bad person it makes you human so dont be so hard on yourself for you to do a flog means that we know you and the family are ok
you cant leave it with that at the end c'mon😂😂😂
so you went from a you tuber  to a chicken tender. lol run from anyone with bbq sauce ! :D
Keira is sooooooooooooo cute!
I like the heart hat most the reason is Cuz a heart symbolizes love and people could always need and show more love and I support that ❤️💯
Inspiration is what the world needs rightnow. What you do is entertaining and inspiring at the same time. Tell your story, you day to day life is amazing. Family life is important. We don't need the big elaborate events. Just you and your family being you is more than enough.
The cliff hanger tho!!!!!
I Resonate Wit These Type Of Videos, Nothin Needs To Be Extra Wit Da Atwoods🌱🌟
I like the raw videos ☺️
Love the videos!  Do more chicken videos and donkey videos and horse videos.  Do a whole video w kids and chickens.
Just do you man don’t worry about what makes us happy worry about what makes you happy and the joy it brings you will flow into us as viewers
No need to apologize ever💌
❤️
The family vlogs are my all time favourite. They lift my spirit every time you post! Please continue to post these types of vlogs
You post this video like 3 times
Yes whatever you film we will watch. We love y’all!!!

no matter what you post i always watch and im always entertained even if its not anything insane literally just what you are doing i love watching. ive been watching since i was like 7 years old and im 15
I can’t find the gaming chair
I think if your genuine and just being real it doesn't matter because it's entertainment regardless. Your true fans will remain with you because they just love to watch you and your family.
It's doesn't matter what you post I will always watch it. :)
We will watch not matter what you entertain us all the time so don’t worry love u guys ❤️
Dude! Anything & everything y’all do is entertaining! We just love seeing y’all (:
are yall vaccinated?
Even your inspiration talks in the vlogs entertain me and lift me up .. I always open these old vlogs when you used to talk at the end of them and just put out some powerful energy ,Stay safe and happy .
I love all of those hats. Roman and family your vlogs are always amazing and entertaining to watch and grow.
Trust me Roman, you could do an entire video on just chickens and it would still be entertaining. Aaaaaagh a cliffhanger! Lol.
Keep Knox doing that his legs are gonna be so strong he will be walking in no time
Your always entertaining man. Like for real
All your videos are on point,  even the hardest ones for you to make. You are real, open and honest I am sure I'm not alone when I say I look forward to being a part of your day . You definitely inspire me to keep my head up and smile. I cant thank you enough and I'm older lol
hopefully the "rainbow" is just a rainbow and doesn't mean anything else....
Roman the days of random vlogging is dead.. imo as a much older viewer/follower get a topic and pursue it. Less everyday life with the fam and more specific topic. this is why Casey and others have moved on
We have chickens now, a little over a year. Fresh eggs are great!
Love these kinda vlogs, it's just good to see all of you, I wld watch yall sit at the kitchen table and talk LOL been watching for MANY YRS!! 50 yr old frm WV.......💙💛
I’m so happy to watch the vlogs again
You should do a house tour!
Honestly just watching you hang out with your family and do family vlogs are everything. I think everyone missed you guys so much we appreciate seeing anything you post. It could just be you saying hi and bye and we’d be appreciated.
Anything you do is inspiring/entertaining no need to put pressure on it at all 🤙🏼
Roman dont worry we will always be here for you and the family no matter what, whether you vlog or not. Take your time ❤️ dont ever feel badd. Its like that saying distance make the heart go fonder ❤️
Don't leave use hanging with big news! Lol
Tell us what Brit lol 😂 Roman over there shaking his head no come on Roman. I love your vlogs They’re always Entertaining you are never boring 😀
💚💙💜❤
You guys make my day better with these vlogs smile more 😁
Woooooooooooow 😂
These are the vlogs I look forward to!!!!!
Roman I love your videos! You are like the only YouTuber that I watch to the videos into the end. :)
Love hearing you talk about your mom, I recently lost my grandfather.
When we were kids we had the biggest bad ass rooster , the only people he attacked everyday was me and my youngest brother . 20 kids got off the bus everyday and that damn rooster came directly after me ! I had to throw a basketball at him just to get into the house . Good luck with the chickens ! No need to apologize. Where is the dog ?
These vlogs are the best just go with the flow of the day 😊
Why is everyone ignoring the ending cliff hanger?
If you aren't vaxed wear that mask.
I am watching so
Produce the content you want to Roman and they will come 😀
I honestly find anything to be entertaining
Love watching, even if the 'content' isn't 'up to par' in 'your eyes' I would rather watch than not have you guys to watch.
Vlog more please
I was so excited to see mo mo, she looks great, you all need to vlog more lol I go through withdrawal
I love the family blogs keep it up
Maybe I missed it, but where is Flash ⚡
This is the best kind of video
I think you should do exactly what you feel in your heart. God has a mission for you and you should just follow his plan. When you do that, you can never go wrong.
Kinda wanna know where flash is at
Omg THAT CLIFFHANGER though!!! 🤪
These typa vlogs are the best vlogs
So what other states are mask free now ? We in Illinois don’t have that privilege quite yet and where there are options we still see mostly masks
We are in such a different world now, a lot of people are doing exactly what you are! And it’s smart to be out there cultivating some of your own food and having land. 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
9:08 “let’s have more kids”  Roman: 😂😐
I loved this vlog! I think the best videos are the family vlogs. ☺️☺️
Roman you should do a gardening video
All “shes” as far as you know so far 😆👍🏼 🐔 🐔 🐔 Hopefully no Roosters 🐓 cock a doodle doooooo 🎶
I'll watch no matter what you're all doing. It's entertaining either way to me. For me I have a disability which makes it not possible to just live a "normal" life. So seeing these videos as simple as this bring me joy! Thanks Atwood family!
I will literally watch anything you post and be beyond happy with it, I love you roman 🖤
Just keep filming…no matter it’s entertaining or just Inspiring. We Love you and we have learned a lot from you.  So thank you.  Smile More 😃 Love from India 🇮🇳
what happened to the red truck cliford
But Roman, whatever you are doing IS entertaining!  Your uplifting is what we want and need in our lives, bring it on! 😁
Wait are we not going to tell them...(head nod no). They might be your best ending ever.  Lol loved it!!
We have silkies
Roman I started watching you because of the videos with family. All I want is to see videos from you. Your videos make my day better every time.
Can you please take kayne to the dentist to have his teeth whitened or atleast tell him to brush his yellow teeth 🤮
It's alright Roman you don't have to always entertain us everytime. Just seeing you guys is entertaining enough. I'm so glad you filmed today because I had to attend a funeral for a best friend today and was just so down today. But I saw the notification for the vid today and it definitely helped me through this horrible day. Thanks Roman for everything you and the fam do and for y'all's positivity.
Hatch Emu
TELL US WHAT??!
Everything roman does is awesome, i really loved todays video. You should definitely do more ranching videos.

🥰✨🥰
Love the cliffhanger
Please tell me if you are watching "GoldShawFarm" for inspiration?  🐤

We’ve been telling you for so long, that just taking us along for the mundane life things is entertaining enough. Most of us are invested in your wonderful family and just want to see you guys. 😊 Long time supporter of everything you guys do.
I have 7500 chickens on an egg farm, pretty awesome, but we need to replace them every 1,5 years. It feels terrible when you «get rid of them», but the new small ones are so cute! Anyways love the vids, been subscribing for years, keep up the great work! Greetings form Norway :)
I like the sunshine hat. Inspire, entertain, any day we have a Roman vlog is our sunshine.
I just got my first chickens! I also have 10 ducks coming soon!
Im saving rn to get some land and get a farm going , do you have problems with predators?
I like the sunshine hat.
I have a chicken and shes 8 years old
Honestly I just like seeing what y’all are up to
I got chickens (4) and ducks (2)
I love your daily vlogs. Going with you on your everyday life is so good to watch xxx
Wow - NO masks - so glad to hear that Covid has disappeared from USA
You could save they’re all chicks
Lmao that's same thing we put on our truck lmao 🤣
WEAR A MASK 😷
Get a miniature donkey for the chicken are so nothing eats em.
What is it u wanna tell i wanna know HAHAHAHA
We will watch you no matter what the videos are,  If you want to entertain us do that, If you want to inspire us do that,  If you want to make longer videos do that,  Even if you don't think people will want to watch it, the real fans will and think about in the future you can go back and watch the videos and relive the memories you have.  Record everything in your life and we will watch it all, record a little and we will still watch it all.  SMILE MORE ❤️❤️
Just seeing you and your family are entertainment and inspiring, thank you for letting us tag along in your daily life
Great video like always it’s nice to see you back on YouTube you have been apart of my life for many years it’s like without watching you I have a part missing from Myself, thank you for being in youtube best youtuber ever.

Obviously the entertainment videos are fun and great to watch, I absolutely love ALL of your content. I like seeing your everyday lives. And you and your family are very inspiring. Love seeing you guys making a comeback!
More please, That was a real family video.
How many times you will be sorry 😂
No masks lucky touchy Cuomo has fucked up Ny and we still got masks.
Broo I didn’t even notice nobody without a mask 😭😭😭😭
I love seeing this side of you guys. It’s not only uplifting, but I love seeing your family do things you love. That’s a perfect amount of entertainment. ❤️
You 100% need to get cows
Longest you post something we would watch no matter what you post !! :)
Your vlogs are always inspiring and entertaining
Maybe three times a week to keep it consistent... It worked for me when I needed to go to the gym. I would have done it everyday but, since I am resolving a situation; I was only able to do three times a week.
Tell us about what? tell us? 😂🤔
I’ve been here since the beginning with the pranks. You guys have always been entertaining and inspiring to me and you and your family help me and motivated me to make my dreams my realities. Keep up the great work and thank for being you guys!!!!!
are you going to get a stare for knox
I don't have chickens, but I have had ducks. I really think you guys should add 4 or 5 ducks to your flock. They are so much fun to watch and the duck eggs are great for baking. My personal faves are Ancona ducks and Cayuga ducks. Love your channel!
what was that ending??!!
Love you
Lmao lucky you have no masks rn in California we still have masks
I would watch you no matter what you post. I love you and your family. You inspire me to be a better parent to my kids and for that I will be forever grateful 🥰
We like these ALOT better then the movies.  Thanks for any of them they are fun to watch and encourageing
Keep up your good hard work and keep up putting content out there because I appreciate you and you were the 1st ever YouTube that I subscribed too so keep up the good hard work
Just left from the live on Instagram!! Now watching the vlog for the day
My life is AWFUL right now. No place to live Husband jobs not looking good

Do daily vlogs record what ever you want
Wrong , you are entailment ! You are so awesome! Thank you
Yes please do a vid on how u started the company like all the nit and grit the bad and the good I’m sure young entrepreneurs would like to know
I have one question, where is flash?
Just sharing about God and all of that is love
I love you and your family. Take your time filming it will come back, my grandson and I have missed you and your family. May god bless you each and every day💞💞💞
I love all the videos
❤️ I'll watch either way. I say to keep it relatable. Today's vid was perfect!

This was entertaining!!! Do what you feel best! Don’t get me wrong I will miss the lake tricks but I just enjoy you and your family 💕
I'm so attached to your family I love these vlogs. They're my favorite!
👍💞💖💞💖💞👍
Been here from the beginning, will always be here💜
I have a whole bunch of chickens and we sell eggs 🥚 🍳
You should get silkies they stay fluffy and poofy even grown and big
Had to leave us with that cliffhanger at the end
Realy cool hats dude!
Ahhhh! I tumble rocks and it’s sooooo fun!
rual king
Hey. Let's just hope that the lack of masks doesn't presage yet another surge in infections.
Roman you should always remember that your everyday vlogs were the reason you used to uplift people naturally. Just keep doing you and don't over think it. We love you guys 🙌
Which vlog has the Minecraft birthday?
Bro I’m literally eating chicken wings
Whatever you do...my family will watch💜
Those hats are actually 🔥
My brother and me breed Belgian fighters chicken liege game fowl (not for fighting it’s for chicken chows for Beauty bdw)
honestly I've been here since the beginning and I just feel just seeing yall like normal vlogs is enough. just watching like these random videos are amazing bc they really are vlogs and like a window into ur life
It's more about you all sharing your life.  It does not have to be entertaining but inspiring..
I love watching you and seeing your family!
Wheres flash?
I prefer some chill family vlogs and some inspiring and "down-to-earth" than "out of this world entertaining" vlogs if I'm honest!
I 100% agree with the no masks. It's so nice to breathe and see people's faces
You don't have to entertain anything you put out is awesome to watch trust me when I say this alot of people love whatever you put out ❤ just do you and everything will be good love your videos nomatter what it is   Smile 😁 more
I love your hardwood floor i know its a little weird but i install them and i love a good hand scrapped floor🤩🤩🤩
Vlogs like these are amazing, the way I think about is it’s better to have a video than none :)  Have a great day everyone who sees this comment
I think we’ve been saying this a lot, yet Roman is still unsure, that we genuinely love the laid back family vlogs. in fact, it’s my favorite type of vlogs.
That’s a rich man quote  🤷🏼‍♂️”ehhhh just throw them in the cart”
Hold up... what happened at the end? I want to know what Brit was talking about. Tell us Roman!!!!!!
Can someone please explain why they bought chickens instead of breeding some with the eggs they get each day?
everything you do either you're just talking to us or having fun its all entertaining tu us.
19:34 tell us wat🤔
'are we not going to tell them', alright keep your secrets funny man
Roman every video you and your family makes all great videos expire people make people smile and you make people who are brighter days anytime we get to see your videos and what I see you’re a great father a great husband and you love animals that’s all great things so keep up the good work please
See u in another 3 months. I don't see why he just doesn't stop youtube and I'm surprised alot of people haven't left his page.
I like the balloon hat
We love our chickens 🐔 we love the eggs we have hatched eggs too its easy process and its fun watching them hatch  When they roll in the dirt they are dusting ours like to lay on their sides and sun bath its so cute to watch
I ❤️❤️❤️ the fact that you have chickens. We have 70 hens, 8 roosters and 6 guinea fowl. Also when your chickens roll and flap around in the dirt, they are dust bathing. Enjoy your baby chicks… 😊
Smile more has gone down the drain with these I'm sorry videos
Seeing you and your family is enough roman.
your videos are outstanding I really enjoy videos like this I personally think your over thinking this haha keep up the good work
Know I want chickens
I love  these tipe of video
You don't have to say sorry,me I missed this moment
there's something wrong you can see the pain in his eyes 😣
Sun but I love the old camp one
Genuin people are always entertaining nowadays
Roman we will enjoy any video you put out, not even just saying that. We love to see what you and your family does on a normal day ❤️
That was awesome. Keep them like this.
For me both I intertain and I inspired of what going on to your family.keep it up
I think you are entertaining.  You inspired my son! He wants chickens now.
I am completely content with videos like these. True wholesome warm family videos. I don’t care about being “entertained”  in the way that you’re thinking of, family vlogs are entertaining as well as inspiring. You’ve come so far and have work so hard for you and your family, you do whatever makes you happy, that’s what makes me and others happy.
Roman you look so young hmmmm are u gettting younger then old?
You entertain me now mater what
Roman, are you ever going to explain what happened causing you to stop vlogging on your channel? Just curious. Love the great vibes!! Thank You
how about you just entertain and inspiring at the same time, just try to fit some inspiration in every clip if thats what it takes.
I own chickens and at my friends farm I’m at a lot there is sheep and horses
A lot of people like baby animals so this is  entertaining.😊
I watch your video's for you, I don't care if it's entertaining... I just love to see what you guys are up too.
Mawmaw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You are always entertaining and inspiring tho, every video I laugh and pick up some lessons like just now, I confirmed from you that chickens are a good investment.
I have 52 chickens and 2 trukys
I’ll honestly watch anything you post.
Román we need houes tour :)
U guys are so much fun to see
As a down south country girl this is entertaining to me.  I love this just random vlog. It really helps to pass hard days, stressful days and such. Just hearing you put your wisdom out there is inspiring.
My favorite is the rainbow is because of how it can help represent the LGBTQ+ community!
We need a house tour!!!!!!!
Everything you do is entertaining and inspiring. Thank you for all you do. Always remember no matter what Atwood family. Smile more.
I just love watching your videos they make me smile 😊even on the days I’m not doing so well with my anxiety  you can always make me smile  thank you for that 😀
Dude you were gone for so long and the Roman army was still here waiting. You don’t need to apologize for anything bro. We all love you no matter what man.   Smile more!
Omg
Roman .. you can stare at the camera for 5 minutes straight and 98 percent of us would still watch ! 🙌❤️😤
I've been watching you for so long, since, before your daughter was born, since when Noah was Kane's age, and longer than that. whoa! It's amazing to see your family grown.
Just watching your videos and seeing all you guys happy keeps me entertained!
I think we can all agree, we don’t care what you do, as long as you’re uploading 😎👍🏼
Your wrong. This is entertaining and also inspirational.
Kora is so grown up !!!
Aww I always smile when I see your videos... leave the entertainment for the media, I would love to see more inspirational videos from you! 🖤
Sun
Every one of your videos are both entertaining & uplifting. Always. Just keep rolling the camera!
Great flog

break an old green beer bottle and make sea glass
What happened with the dehydrator?  How did they turn out
When’s the house tour
Roman can we get a garage tour???
Roman is the one YouTuber that I will always be excited to watch no matter what content he puts out. He's the most positive on the this platform and never gets himself into any drama. definition of youtube legend
When ever you post you entertain and motivate no worries man.
Judgement, in turn Acceptance, are fallacies because one is informed and functions under a unique Gold Standard birthed amongst varying blends of cultures and religions, not a vacuum🎈
I actually miss these types of videos  going out to eat going to the store I miss those old  videos of you just being a family  I think those are the videos that people feel more connected
She is the cutest little girl. Congrats. Great family
I'll take any video you post, but if given or asked,  as you kindly did..I've always loved family vlogs like this one a smidge.more than entertaining ones. 🥰
We love all your videos Roman. Don’t worry if they are just an average day we love you guys
What happened to flash
I love watching your raw vlogs just what you guys are up to! It feels good to be a part of it in a way. It's so fun seeing the family and what y'all are doing. Keep it up you are doing great. I'm sure it's hard too to get back into it after everything that happened last year. You got this.
Free Palestine
Me is depressed
Your always entertaining! Anything you do! I love your videos
I miss you guys!
So much has changed since I last watch them when I was a little kid.

Legend
Being honest at this point everything entertains now a days

You do what you love to do and people love you for that.

Thank you for the vlog. You really brighten up my day. Smile more
Love y'all. You are so inspiring. Follow your heart those of us that have been here will always be. Love getting updates on the family, speaking of how is your dad? Flash? Would love updates
U should do some more stuff with traxxas
We love the daily vlogs ..it makes us feel like a part of your family. Your daily vlogs help more than you know
Simply a video of anything is entertaining for us. We just want to see you and your family as it brings us joy :)
Believe it or not but these are my FAVORITE kinda of vlogs. ❤
Just vlog.
Kitty prob likes the big bowl bcz they get whisker fatigue when their whiskers r touching the sides of their dishes.. I'd get a cat fountain they love running water bcz running water is usually safe and fresh ;) and doesn't touch their whiskers lol
Where’s flash?
If your happy then I’m entertained no matter what your doing . If your unhappy I won’t be entertained. Keep doing you Roman you’ve done a good job so far ☺️
I would rather you do these type of vlogs then non at all. Thank y’all.
what did you not tell us about
Chickens take showers in the dirt/dust
Been watching you from the start! This content is more then entertaining enough.  We love anything you put out always makes our day better :)
You need to open chicken farm you will have lots of benefits
Just hanging out with you and the family is enough for me Roman... it doesn't matter what you guys are doing... its that much enjoyment!
I LOVE this style of vlogs!  Love seeing what you guys are doing.. absolutely love seeing the animal care!  What more donkeys and horses
These up to date vlogs are nice. Seeing all the animals and your kids. Hopefully you made a lot on that custom ring made out of that coin. I couldn't afford it lmao
Got the same keyboard
You would leave us on a cliffhanger 😭
There is nothing more inspiring than seeing the Atwood's living their best lives. Big up Roman
You should see if you consuls set up a live stream so people can watch the chicks grown in real time
Definitely the balloon 🎈
I’ve got some chickens and they are awesome cause you don’t ever have to buy eggs
your entertainment IS inspiring, everything you do is inspiring.
always about the family and inspiriatian
Vlogs like this are so much more entertaining to me than the ones that are made for entertainment!
I got aoem
Love these videos way more feels like I can relax and watch and enjoy with you guys❤️
If you hatch your own eggs... you t want to prepare the kids LOL.. when I was four years old I saw baby chicks hatch at the science Museum of Boston and I haven’t eaten eggs since and I’m 44
Honestly I love these vlogs.. this is my entertainment lol
Try 2 to 3 day a week then
Day Dreams was pretty inspiring. What ever happened to that???
Dude just post when ever... its good to see ya and get an update on the fam... just focus on your fam... brit take over if ya dare... lol love the Atwoods!
I help raise 2 million chickens a year😂
I’ve been with this family for a very long time now and you have no idea how inspiring your videos are. You just lift our bad days. I can’t even explain it. I love this family so much.
WE LOVE SEEING YOUR SMILES THATS WHAT I LOOK FORWARD TOO SO ONLY VLOG WHEN YOU FEEL SO AND THAT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR MOST OF US :)
Omg I just realized Cora is the ONLY one with brown eyes 🥺😭
I want goats but my parents won’t let me have them
What happened to flash?
Wait!! Y’all have a horse now too ?!
Amen
9:05 for sure Roman isn't planning on more kids anytime soon. And here I thought they were gonna go to the lucky 7
But the thing is, you are entertaining and inspiring
i enjoy the vlogs. i am inspired by every video you put out. plz keep going on with them
We're is your dog 🐕
I think for me daily vloggers are my family away from family, as we don't live near our family. I also love seeing how other people live their lives. I know that may sound weird but you may be the light that someone needs that day.
Few greys on the old head Roman hahahah 😂
Roman can post anything he does in his daily life and i will find it entertaining
Man you guys have gotten better OLD
Great to see you guys... and those chick's are so cute really can't wait to see them grow....also inspirational videos are entertaining and if there's alaugh here and there that's a bonus. xxxxx 🥰
Just do what ever makes you and you’re family happy you know we have your back
What is interesting to me is seeing normal people live their lives just like I do every day. It doesn’t always have to be something extravagant.
I just gonna say that it doesn’t matter what you are filming, it doesn’t matter if it’s a short video, it doesn’t matter at all. I mean you put what ever you feel like putting out on your chanel, but when you talked about where your heads at right now and that your goal is to inspire people. I realised that your personality is the inspiration, that you being yourself and doing what ever feels right is more than enough to inspire and entertain people. I feel that way at least and I just want to say that you cheer me up every single time I whatch your videos and that you genuinely make me feel happy inside and that you are a great rolemodel. I just whant you to now that you are a reason that I make better choises in my life, and I belive that there is a lot more people that feel that way. Thanks for being You!
That cliffhanger though...
I love the uplifting vlogs just showing us what u guys get upto from day to day thanks for taking us along and sharing with us love from Scotland x
Just do like a... (cough) 24 hour stream (cough)
You could film cleaning the house or watching tv and I’d still probably watch. Lmao don’t not post cause you think it’s not entertaining us when 90% it is. Lol
Can you meet the cboystv

I love these family day vlogs and enjoy watching the farming stuff,!
Great videos man love to see when you guys post videos

Finally a look at a sane family! Not freaking out about masks around other people and in stores.
We like normal vlogs like this
We Love change DO IT ROMAN :D
Please come back like at least 3 days a week!!
Anyone know what happened to flash ?
I’ll take inspiration over entertainment any day. Your doing good Roman!
I hate cliff hangers 😢 Why do you do this...
crazy how as a 6th grader roman was inspiring me and im almost a senior in high school and this man still inspiring me. love this family like they my own!
Just vlog idc what it is. I’ll watch. Even if it’s just a sit down
F the mask!
Cora is so sweet! Love your whole family!
Sorry as will I did watch you from 2019, been not on looking for storyline because been playing hard online. Ark is a game I loving it. Still comes to look now and again. I think is when you got your oldest Noah, been hard keeping time! It just don't wait for me. Happy your going to father teacher now that awesome!!!!
I think I can speak for a lot of us, we enjoy these kind of videos. I have enjoyed seeing your family grow. So excited to watch the chicks 🐤🐥 grow
Hi
Massive cliffhanger 😩
Which royal king are ya at
seeing your day to day life is way more inspiring than anything bc it shows how you can come from little and gain alot in life and you truly show this. stay strong and courageous
This is exactly what we all were missing💜
This kind of content is still entertaining.   You don't need stunts, RCs, explosions etc to entertain
my neighbor has a ton of chickens and he said once he gets his house up here, and moved in we won't need to buy eggs anymore.
I love this kind of content. I was inspired, and it was entertaining. I’d still come back to watch this every day.
I love this content dude
Roman's like Thanos he spent 15 years getting the stones and now after he snapped he is on a farmland tending to the farm
My boyfriend's mom and step dad probably have about 400-500 if not more chickens.. you can't walk in their yard without running into them
Sunshine
Waiting for the house tour
Tbh I’m with Roman I like the Vlogs
Tell us what??😅🤨
I like the sun one the best has the best vibes out of them all
We love ya your Beautiful and one of a kind S😊ILE MORE! ATWOOD FAMILY
I love these vlogs, it just makes me happy seeing the family doing just daily things!
Honestly roman this vlog was the most entertaining and fun to watch I just love these family vlogs now no more of the challenges and crazy stuff these are the videos I love and make me happy and SMILE. Keep doing these they are entertaining to me and many of us can agree.
I find your videos both entertaining and inspirational
its crazy to see when I first was watching I was in 5th grade. and now I'm about to be a junior watching this while they have so many kids. its insane I've never just sat down and thought how fast the time goes by.
Please DO NOT APOLOGIZE! You don't have to be disappointed about anything.  I LOVE Watching your Family  Thankyou for even being willing to share your EVERYDAY LIFE😁😄😊
where’s flash?

"Tell them about.." WHAT?!? I'm so CURIOUS right now!!  😳
Roman It's Been "just what you been doing" for the last 9 years, and look at the family you've built from "what you do each day" Keep The Entertaining Up Man, We Love It
Epic cliffhanger....again
I like both type of vlogs. It’s really cool just watching your vlogs either way. Soon as a notification pops up I hope it’s a Roman Atwood vlog
We all love you guys
I highly suggest getting goats
Love watching the everyday Atwood family vlogs! Would love to see more of Noah. Whatever you vlog is always fun to watch

Where is flash?
You should contact ima survival sanctuary for a couple baby goats

Keep these vlogs 🔥🔥🔥
Love it!
i just enjoy watching your vlog no matter what vlog you post i just enjoy every content!!
Vlogging (short for “video blogging”) is the daily practice of capturing and sharing vlogs characteristically featuring a vlogger shooting themselves at arm’s length throughout their everyday activities.   maybe do something like charles and allie are doing
I think I Hurd him say 3 days a week
Where is Flash?
Rode island reds are domnonot
More vlogs like this please I LOVE THEM!  I love you guys.
Cora is the definition of adorable ☺ cuteness overload!
Family vlogs are great so keep doing just the daily life stuff
Always Entertained by you no matter what you do!!
I love anything you put out.  They make me happy.  Life as been a little tough lately and they make me feel better.  Please keep them coming.  Also, try getting your indoor cats a water fountain.  They like water that is moving.  Don’t put it near there food.  They don’t like it.
Can you pls do a house tour
Hey! Tell us about what?? No cliffhangers!!! Lol. I love chickens and used to raise them. But we moved and now I can't have them.  So I am going to be watching..
I love vlogs like these! They are my favorite!
I just love watching your family do it's everyday thing. It doesn't have to be exciting it doesn't have to be super fun we just want to know what you're doing. So if you can please just take us along. I promise I will not miss one single video no matter what it's about. 🙂
Mean not eveyone has the opportunity to buy chickens and do what you may consider normal. I just like to see what your up to and how you live your life compared to myself and others around the world. You inspire us all just by your journey from where you where to what your doing now. No need to show off or try to impress us as we're all happy just to see you're family happy and getting on and growing.
Yummy chicken nuggets
More entertaining is what makes me happy because if you are happy I am happy
Can someone tell me what happen to flash
You guys could get a steer and raise it tk have fresh beef the only expensive thing the processing for it
My broody hen just had 4 chicks hatch today!!
I’m already a minute in a mama was my favorite clip of her cussing
Romans birthday is coming up the 28th, a day before mine Happy early birthday 🎉
Omg Cora I remember when she had her 1st birthday and was crying the hole time. So cute
I like the family vlogs me being honest
We love you. And your family
“Let’s have more kids” Roman 😐
My neighbour has chickens
I would like to watch a vlog that you dont come back to promote your products and all that other bullshit that involves people buying something! Ridiculous!!
when i think of roman i remember all the laughs while watching his videos and i remember my hole childhood
What happened to your eye brow lol
I always love it when you just hit record!! Honestly I love the family vlogs more then the entertainment vlogs. Inspiring is always a plus!!!
I did have chicken but I have dog so I can't have chicken anymore 😭 hop you have fun with them
These types of videos are amazing! I love watching ever video whether it's entertaining or inspirational.
All we want is to see you guys doing anything and inspire as you always do ! I’m 64 and you and your family blesses my heart! God Bless you and your family Roman! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

Family time is always important and that is inspirational as well! I've been with you guys since the beginning, you guys don't have to do something extravagant...family time is what I love. Blessings to you all! 💙
17:57 I mean, we're here for the long haul! :) I appreciate any vlog. "Entertaining" or not. You doing things that i normally wouldn't see, like going to get chickens and talking about raising chickens, entertains me. You talking, and sharing is entertaining me. You're not obligated to out do yourself. This might get washed in the sea of thousands of replies. But, you are always an inspiration, just for even doing vlogs. Makes me want to pick up my camera again and just do it. But, I feel no one would watch me, since I sit at the computer 90% of my day. Once we fully open though. Might just do that! :)
9:06 LOL 🤣🤣
You should get a good telescope for the backyard!
Still love Roman but he seems like he lost his point of YouTube it shouldn’t be for us it should be for him and his family to see his kids grow and for him to look back in the future.
my neibour has chickens and they layed eggs in our barn and we didn't see them form at least a week it's a huge stink bomb
You’re totally entertaining me!! Love just watching you guys do you!!
Roman, I am both inspired and entertained. But no Roman, rivers take just as long to polish a stone as your tumbler.   Brit. If you feel like blogging, vlog! Pick up the camera and vlog. Your channel will have 5 million subscribers in a day!
Hey Everytime you put a vid out there we will be interesting and  we learn everytime  you post
Your vids are just perfect
Where is flash at?
Don’t worry about entertaining us. Seeing   the vlogs are amazing and entertaining in and of itself
favorite ironic moment in the vlog: 6:11 “See everyone smile. I’m about to run this lady over, she’s not gonna smile”
Hi Roman. I have 13 chickens and I would love it if u got goats 🐐
You have to put marbles in the water dish so they do t drown
That's how the chicken shower they dig a hole and let the dirt take the bugs off
19:34 pregnant ?
Beautiful video. Would like to see Mr Atwood and see how he is doing

Roman I will always watch whatever you decide to do. I am just glad to see you back making videos And you guys are happy that's what matters most. Thank you for all the rough times you have gotten me through in my life.
We have chickens we love them!!They are so fun.
My grandparents have chickens and they're in their 80s they absolutely love getting fresh eggs.

Roman, you just do what you do and people will follow.
Masks were dumb af anyway. If you re use them or touch them they are literally useless.

I just did my first smile more purchases and I’m so beyond excited!! I have waited for YEARS to be able to be financially supportive of myself and I reached my goal and decided to reward myself! THANK YOU for everything y’all do. You’re the reason a lot of people have a reason to smile and smile more❤️🖤
This is the content we love!
we true fans just like seeing you and the family 💜
I like the rainbow hat and the balloon 🤩
I think your videos are intertanment and inspirational
Your videos are so inspiring!! Love your videos!!!
Dude I feel for you guys and everyone else. We have only been required to wear masks once for a few weeks in Australia. Some other states maybe a month or two but not the entire covid time. It doesn’t feel like we have a pandemic and we are very very lucky. I hope other Countries get there soon.

Also we love family vlogs! I’m pretty sure I can speak for most when I say just seeing you and your family do anything is entertaining to us because we missed you guys so much. I get inspired by you period! I don’t need to watch crazy stuff all the time. Just be you!
At this point, watching u guys living ur life is entertaining to me
I have chickens. I think around 25. I've lost count. Lol chicken math.
It’s almost like you’ve entertained the kids for the last 15 years and now you entertain the parents!
Just do family vlogs those are the best.
That sneaky cliffhanger at the end, though...
Y’all need some livestock guardian dogs! Great Pyrenees are amazing!
Cora looks like mommy
I love any kind of vlog I just love watching you guys and what you do. you motivate me to be better everyday. I don’t have chickens but when I have land I will have chickens 🐓

If you like flowers you should come down to the Philadelphia flower show. They make some crazy stuff out of flowers
I love these ordinary life vlogs 😉
Just noticed your not wearing masks anymore. We still have to in the UK.
My parents have chickens that they let out on the yard often, and they have a border collie that herds them back to the coop at night.
Did y’all know Country got married! Congratulations Country!💍
So Is The Smile More Store Still On The Old Property???
Either way you go love to see the family and the new adventures to come.
Roman, you should look up some homested vlogs and see how many followers they have, i watch all kinds and im inspired and entertained, heres a few you can check out, Arms homestead, Justin Roads, keeping it Dutch,and my very favorite Lumah Acres. this should give you ideas. good luck
smile even more without a mask......
This is what we want! This is the exact type of videos that we started to fall in love with your channel, your family, your message! Keep it up. Relax and don’t stress that makes the best content.
The video they were talking about just turned up on my recommend 🤣🤣
God bless you all love your family and videos
Wait!!! Are you not gonna tell us what??? Nice cliffhanger! Lol!
This is what we want! This is the exact type of videos that we started to fall in love with your channel, your family, your message! Keep it up. Relax and don’t stress that makes the best content.

I Love your Videos and your Family so what ever you do is totally inspiring for my own Family . Smile More and be blessed 😊😊👍👍

I havent seen his dad in a while or his brother. I wonder how they been! ❤️
The chicks footage at the end I find so relaxing
not me
Cora is not only the only girl but she has brown eyes which is extremely rare for two blue eyed parents to have a brown eyed child!
LOL. Always skip weeks, then come back to just promote new merch lol
Balloon one
We love our chickens and ducks! ❤️
We love all videos
Your life is entertainment for us and it is an inspiration. You have nothing to apologize for, sometimes life gets in the way.
I have 40 chickens
I have chickens! Great to see your post!
As a child we had chickens.  My Mother would sell eggs for pocket money.  Amazing.
If you ever think that something your going to do is not entertaining. Just remember, millions of people watch a guy make subs every day
I’m a big fan since 2015
Im just here for the “you’re beautiful, you’re one of a kind, smile more” thats all i care about😂
Honestly when he said that he doesn’t see that vid entertaining I like seeing your family grow I like seeing what you guys do during the day I just don’t want you guys to worry in us the viewers just worry about your life and what you need to do I love you guys!!!
got to say whenever I watch your vlogs it makes me want to start making stuff like those rocks and those plants. It seems like it's very grounding.
Roman u dont need to explain or apologise for what u do or don't do , ur an inspiration & u have a beautiful family so take each day as it comes .... in ur own words  " ur beautiful ur one of a kind smile more "  🙂🌈 🐥
If I'm completely honest, I am so sick and tired of people on YouTube trying to "inspire" others.  I don't watch YouTube videos for inspiration.  I watch them strictly for entertainment purposes.  It doesn't take much to entertain me.  A simple daily vlog without anything fancy is all it takes.  As soon as anyone starts in with the inspiration "bs"... I dip so fast it would anyone watching me whiplash!
I love these kind of videos. But you need to update us on a few things. How many acres do you have?. Is Noah going to school now or is he still homeschooled. He left us hanging last time. Did Noah get his haircut or not. What’s up with your brother and your dad. We need to see them. He said just a few things I’d like to know. I always watch all your videos all the way to the end. Glad you guys are back. Glad you guys are having fun. Family is everything
Cora is gonna be the most extroverted, goofiest, hopefully happy, teenager
Roman Atwood is the only loyal thing I can fall back on after my failed relationship 😃
WAITTTT SHES PREGGO??????
turning into the circle by ending with a cliffhanger
I love more inspiration you’re doing a great job this is amazing
Your bragging because you worked hard for 15 years??? Wow you are out of touch with reality and the real world. I’m unsubscribe good by
Omg I love this yall will always be my source of happiness  no lie this is what I want to do when I have kids
Not gonna tell us about what?!?!?
I've been saying for a long time that I would like to see the family Day-to-day stuff! You know the crazy stuff the sad stuff the funny stuff just life man! That plant that you had in your dad's pot that he made. I had a friend give me one of them when my mom passed away! Y'all stay safe my friends!
Why are you sorry
This was great
At the end of the day roman no matter how much you vlog even though we want you to vlog everyday. or what you vlog your real roman soldiers will be here till the end just love that you're still doing good after all that happened.
Everything you do is entertaining
vlog when you want to. there's no pressure
I truly enjoy these types of Vogs and love just the family  and everyday videos.
There is something so magical about children and their enthusiasm for life, even mundane moments are transformed into adventure.   I love it. 17:56
Hats are so cheaply made it’s. Not worth what there asking
Please keep posting to uplift. This has always been the reason I watch your videos.
your chickens were rolling in the dirt is good for them there taking a dust bath, it helps with ridding perasites on them and there is a dust to mix with the dirt that is medacated to help with that,. i have a woodin square i fill with dirt and this med dust and they love it
I have been watching you for 7 years
Hey man you just do you, Grab a camera an just record you guys playing with your chickens or what ever. Your inspirational just as a person. Watching your videos it makes me want that grind an put in the work to hopefully get to where your at with your family an business!! Keep on being awesome! hope to see your guys more often. 👍
God bless everyone Jesus loves you and died for you
I hatch different breeds of chickens each year. I love my chooks.
God bless everyone Jesus loves you and died for you
God bless everyone Jesus loves you and died for you
Me and my family just hit a year of raising 10 chicken for the first time. We build the chicken run by hand and  turned an old shed building into a coop.
tell us what ??? the parrot flower vase that your dad made really reminded me of your mom <3 LOVE YOU GUYS VERY MUCH  !
Well, Memorial weekend is coming up. Going to remember with a firework show? I know you used to love some fireworks.
Are you fully vaccinated ?
I rather see inspiration🤗 up lifting
I’ve been giving my best friend chickens for his birthday for the last 4 years 😁😂
Wheres flash

That’s fine with me
brit: just a hair small  roman: throw em’ in the cart
This is what it’s all about man. We just love watching y’all do you, we enjoy the smiles. 🙏🏻 bless up
Love anything you post I love you and your family
Roman I think it would be dope if you did like every Monday, Thursday and Sunday like a good structure even throughout the week to capture moments in the time between
Where are the gtr’s
Roman. We all love you. I love you’re family. Please don’t worry so much, and just roll the camera, have fun with it again. It’s hard to see you struggle❤️

We wouldn’t watch your videos if we didn’t think they were entertaining
I would still like to watch the videos even if it’s entertaining or just inspiring
Vote for Roman to get his tattoos re colored
you entertain me and inspire me on many levels, i have literally no one in my life, they all moved away, so this is how i can stay sane is by watching you vlog and talk
We got chickens like 2-3 weeks ago they’re rlly fun and cool
Roman... just know, you can post literally anything you want, and we will still watch it. Entertaining, inspiring, it doesn’t matter. Only thing that matters to us is seeing you and your family happy!
Right when i needed it... Been going through a hard time lately
Tell us about whaaaaattttt?? And you both are and will always be, an inspiration! So keep being you❤️😬
I love watching your family and what y’all are up too
I need some roosters so they can have babies so you don’t have to keep buying them
MORE normal vlogs! :D
Roman, i dont know if you know it. But you have to be carefull when buying chickens like that because alot of them might be hatched out with a heat lamp. The chicks are fine and all, they just dont know how to make and care for their own eggs with chicks in them. So yea, i love that you have chickens its so nice, just wanted to inform you :) Big fan from Denmark man!
JUST POST! Whatever the content is, we will watch and love. 😌
He should so get goats
We love getting a glimpse of everyday life, you and your family are fantastic and inspire and entertain us no matter what you do thank you for the videos !!
We just love to watch y'all...Just pick up the camera and go💗☺️
All the kiddos are getting so big. We will try to send ya a photo of us. Ee ride dirt bike. We dont have enough room for chickens...
When is Roman going to realize that anytime he turns on the camera whether they are sitting on the couch staring at the wall or going out and riding jet skis across the woods we love it and it inspires us and it makes us happy just to see them at all
Great video. I live in Ireland, we have our own chickens, about 40 or more. We buy 6 or so new hens every few months to keep the egg stocks up. Great way of getting fresh eggs in the morning.
For me every video from you is awsome even if its not funny bc i like everything like seeing what u do in your life
Where is Flash???
yessirr
these goldfish actually smack
so happy to see that ma ma is ok with the whole pandemic, Love you guys!!!
I love your videos :) it make me happy when I see your video
I love on a farm and I like see what y’all do over where to me it’s entertaining
Roman your life is entertainment. Just be you daily and I promise people will follow! You live the life every American could dream of. Work 15-20 years super hard and retire young to spend the rest of your life enjoying your family. Unfortunately we're all not that fortunate  and are entertained following your life just to know how great it would be.
Thank you Atwood family for the way you share your family with our family. Us Gilchrist family truly loves your family. We pray for y'all and we greatly enjoy the family time with chickens, science projects... we homeschool as well
I got 3 hens
Hey, watch the old people comments!  🥰
I love watching your vlogs
She’s pregnant
My neighbors have some chickens
I feel like you do what you want. This is your life and you need to do what makes you happy. No matter what you will inspire and entertain people.
I am with y’all
house. tour. !!!
Great video
I hated my chickens 😂
It's funny coz I'm eating chicken nuggets while watching this lol
I died laughing at romans reaction 9:06
Idk about anyone else but I would 100% rather watch this vlog than any stunts or crazy stuff. This makes me so grateful for family, and makes me want to do more things with my husband and little man. 💙
I remeber when cora was just a few months old:/ time flies so fast
Everything yall do is entertaining and inspirational! Keep doing exactly what your doing!!!
9:18 That's how chickens take a bath.
I love to watch the videos of you just filming what your doing its interesting to me! I love it you could literally be doing nothing and I would love it it's just the fact of seeing you and know you guys are ok and watching what you do in a day even if it's not much! I love you guys so much!❤
Is mawmaw ok?
Im 2 hours early!!! Anyways
What happen to the fish?
This is entertaining to me. I like seeing the everyday family thing and seeing you looking after the animals is relaxing and inspiring so I'm for the inspiration thing
Brit tells what.....   Omar.
I'm not here for the entertainment. I am here for you and your amazing family. Whether that be in the ups, or the downs, or the inspirational, or even the entertainment. I just want more of you guys
Never apologize we will always be here and cant wait to see the rocks
That cashier lady wasnt feeling it😂
I like watching you guys on the farm with all the animals and stuff. Just do what you think is right to film. Keep grinding!
We have like 400
Roman those that follow you will follow you through all.  just to see a family go through all their daily life, will inspire others going through their lives.
Do both
God I missed these everyday laid back vlogs!!
Me
What store sells flip-flops and chickens 😂 Amazing
Dude all of your vlogs are entertaining and inspiring no matter what you guys are awesome
I actually like the balloon one
Sundhine
Do Both. Just a little of each never hurt anyone
Do u think u guys will ever get baby ducks ?
Couple of years ago we put a deer blind in our back yard for while to find a new spiny for it and the chickens and roosters were free roam at least to the back yard and had there coops and stuff but the hens would lay eggs in the blind and actually kept them warm enough to hatch
Your dads artwork is incredible
It absolutely does not matter what you film, it is ALWAYS entertaining to me. I just love watching a loving family who is all about their family. The world definitely needs more folks who love & appreciate their families!!
Where can I get one of these train horn guns😂😂😂
You guys have no masks with 21000 active cases, wtf. We have masks with 5 cases.
Proud of your gardening skills!!! Your hobby farm is very cute as well!!! Cora’s hair is adorable!!!
Chickens are amazing! If I have a rough day, I grab a drink and sit by the chickens. We have the same setup for when we get new chickens
Why pet them if you are a chicken eater
I think it's entertaining and inspiring. You can rename it to a day in the life of Roman Atwood...
what  happened in the video y put I’m so sorry for 🥴😑
Intriguing sign off Roman. Keep us guessing.
Hi fam not trying to tell you what to do with your baby but that bounce thing hes in if you notice he is bouncing on one of his legs which over time can create hip imbalance just be careful with those things cause he is still growing..💙🙏
Bro we just love feeling part of your family you share so much with us and you inspire us everyday just keep being yourselfs honest caring loving great parents a great family we love being or feeling part of smile more god bless you and your family

I love the sunshine hat so much.

No matter what the supporters that have been there will always be. im going into my senior year of hs and ive been watching with my brothers since the 3rd grade you've been such a big impact on so many people its time to do what you love and not think of others. keep being u love ya guys
I like the random vlogs🙃
I just bought baby chickens 2 weeks ago
We have over 30 hens. The hens are having dust baths to prevent against parasites.
Love this video!!💙
Why is it almost all your uploads lately your always apologizing
Man I have been saying Roman should start a podcast and use it to inspire and that’s exactly what it sounds like he should do. I mean who agrees?
Only og's knows "playing boardgames" 😝
Hay attwoods good seeing yall
Sounds like what you have been doing, just in a different way. You have always been inspiring to me while being entertaining. Can't wait for this new chapter!
I love how real and amazing yall are!!! I love watching all your  videos, no matter what they are!!!!
I feel like no mater what u film it’s entertaining whether that be farming talking or doing stunts 👍
Y’all could post a video of y’all watching a movie and I’d pop popcorn and watch it with y’all. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Yaaaaaay Maw Maw is back
Do what makes you happy Roman!! As long as I have just a moment I am happy no matter the content! Hey
Bro where’s flash
No chickens yet. But I finally have the credit to buy a house!! First thing I'm getting after buying a house is getting chickens
I like this reminds me of the old days
I love your gfuel  Flavor
Where is flash?
How cool would it be to set up a live stream for the chicks?!
Where’s the donkeys
WAIT TELL US WHAT???
Roman we would like a flashy update please
What happened to mawmaw’s arm🥺
The thing is, no matter what Roman puts out, I’ll always be looking forward to the video. No matter what mood I’m in or what maybe going on in my day, his/your vlogs get me excited.
Where did flash go?
Me maw is looking well
I love your guys’ videos so much 👏🏼 makes my day always :)
Have like 70 chicks a week or few. Have 2 incubators to incubate new chickens with our own eggs. I can tell you that having fresh eggs is the best. Selling chicks is allso fun and profitable. I allso have like 6 sheep cutest things ever. Greetings from lithuania
We don’t want entertaining we want every day life 💙
Now that the world is opening back up you know what that means the vacation vlogs are on the way
Roman could you inspire us to work out and become healthier physically
Roman your vlogs are entertaining whatever it is. At the same time your inspiring us to do better and live a happy healthy life.  These vlogs have inspired so many people and your doing a great job at it!
Family vlogs of daily activities!!!! Those are the best vlogs!!!
Just film everything and anything
Hey Roman get a guard goose. They will protect your ladies from predators. Be sure to get the goose as a baby and raise it with the chicks so it thinks its a big chicken. Trust me you will have little to no chicken deaths.
Hi.
Ahhh loooove these kind of home-y vlogs. So cozy and actual goals❤️😍
Where is the house tour at. Nice to see you back guys
Man I have been saying Roman should start a podcast and use it to inspire and that’s exactly what it sounds like he should do. I mean who agrees?
I love these kinda vlogs. The inspiration ❤
I forgot this channel existed for 3 years
Yes I have been here for a very long time ⌛
You should get goats they are fun.  And I love to show them in my county fair.
Hey, roman. Can we get an update on how much the ring sold for and what you are going to invest the money in?
Roman this video was very entertaining don’t worry we love whatever you put out nowadays because it’s easy to appreciate something when you don’t post enough anymore for us to be picky😂😂
Chickens love to dust bath. They will go back to the same place.  Chickens are cool. Love the planting.  You entertain us all the time. Were older people disable and sick. We love the USA.  Love to visit. But can't travel. Love your smiles but don't hide the real you. We love you guys so much. The  children have grown up so fast. Mine have grownup and been married with four grandchildren now. Our latest was born in January.  Your like watching our own family. Your our American family. God bless you all xoxo 😘😘🥰🥰👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love you guys! ❤️🇨🇦❤️
any thing he post i watch
i and my family get around 30+ eggs a day and we donate them if we get over 100
Looking forward to more vlogs. Motivation comes with picking up the camera more often it’s been a tough year.. I get it smile more :)
Just do you and im prefectly fine with it😁
You’ve got to remember majority of your viewers have been here from the start me being one, 10 years is a long time everyone’s grown up and myself have a 3 year old. Of course we love the entertainment side of things but as a parent I love just watching your day to day family life ❤️

Bro I saw Cora and broke out in tears and said to myself “has it actually been that long”

Where the red Toyota Tundra Clifford?? Haven’t seen it in a long time

Be careful, you will fall prey to chicken math if keep it up. Moving my baby chicks out of the brooder and into the big girl house next week. I will be getting meat chickens the end of June. I like to know where my food comes from.
Your making me excited to move. I’m going from the city to the country and I can’t wait to have chickens and other animals I’m trying to my BF to get. Lolol. But I love this vlog
Man if you sat and talked to the camera for an hour I would still watch because you always entertain me
I have 3 grand chickens in another state. I have a chicken run and coop cam to see them anytime I want. They give 3 eggs every day for now!🐣🐥🐓
I had 10 chickens years ago & I now have 5 chickens now 🤍 keep us updated on the rocks!!
We love anything just missed the videos
I love eating Pollo loco
I have a pig🐷💗
Your gonna need a rooster if y’all wanna have chicks even then some states or county’s have guidelines with having roosters do your research before hand
4:03 chicken nuggets
Your apology will always be excepted Roman no matter what 🙂
Was in middle of watching the 1 1/2 hour wedding video.  Stoped to watch this one. Going right back!!
<3
My dad did rock tumbling when I was a kid
Nice. Guys make sure to comment so he stays in the algorithm lol
You should post like 2 times a week
EXCUSE ME? WHAT ARE YOU NOT TELLING US.......
Look at all those chicken
Where is flash
I feel like I am part of your family so watching what you do every day is entertaining.  When you guys were gone for so long I missed you so much.  You are my favorite YouTube family.  Just watching your videos is uplifting to me.
I love the family vlogs. I can watch your regular day to day shenanigans everyday. Those hour-hour half movie vlogs you guys can do on special occasions like birthdays, vacations that kinda thing. I’ll be here no matter what you guys decide to do.
I love the family vlogs. I'm a Dad too so I get it
Love the stone thing our grandson is into them too got him a grow your own gem set. Maybe do some things like that it's fun. Love you all too great to see you back. 😘😘😘🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👍👍❤❤❤❤
I love these vlogs.
My gran used to have chickens I used to love collecting the eggs
I’ve hand raised a lot of farm animals and one point I had 14 hand raised chickens it’s hard work
I love this vlogs. Love the family ! Love the day to day things.
I LOVE seeing my favorite creators not wearing masks. Sadly where I live, most people still wear them even though they don’t have to.
Did he ever explain where Flash is, or what happened?
God bless y'all fam
The chickens will die if you use the premium pine shavings
<3
Inspiration
So good to see you 💜🌹🙏 Smile More 😍🥰😘
I love the idea of inspiring.  This is a blessing from God for you to do.  Always be reminded that he is with you and it is his purpose for us being here.  You have been so blessed and you have blesse so many with your uplifting words.  God bless to you and your beautiful family.
We love the content
Wear your MASK. Covid hasent ended
We have 33 chickens and 14 turkeys with plans to get pigs, goats and cows in the future @tryintofarm
Now this is my kind of vlog!  ❤  Love you guys so much!
You should make Noah film so whenever I get kids and I have kids they can watch Noah I love you my dream for 8 years was to meet you
You have helped me through so much ever since the first house you have been helping me stay positive. Even when you took a break I would watch old videos if I was feeling down. Thank you to the whole Atwood family for helping me be the most positive I’ve ever been❤️
old scoot stuff was funn
I’m 17 and I run a small chicken farm with help from my dad I’ve recently started hatching chicks I have got about 50 chickens and 50 chicks and a few ducklings aswell
It’s been awhile!!! Missed you guys!!!
Favourite blog in ages !!
I LOVE that you’re wanting to Inspire, but honestly Roman you’ve ALWAYS inspired me! And the reason Is that I feel your genuine delight and excitement with what you do and for me, that’s pure entertainment! It may not be “entertaining” from a certain perspective but I’d rather connect with genuine people instead. Digging the new merch! Smile More! Been here since 2014 😊👊
What if you do every Tuesdays and Thursdays? That gives you enough time to spend time with your family and also vlog.
You are the best Roman! So happy to see any video you make. Don’t stop believing in yourself. The true day oners will always be here!
As a young man, young adult myself. I look forward to your family and entertainment and especially informative and constructive videos. I have a small family myself and love seeing your family!
I have chickens, ducks, quail and pheasant
Tell us about what?
I love the family vlog videos ♡
Simple family videos
Yay! I'm hoping you're having another baby.
Chickens? I know what you need. A rain water collection chicken watering system. And I know JUST the guy for the job...
inspiring over entertainment was a perfect explanation. I feel like most of us that have grown up with you that are now in our mid 20s or 30s love seeing what we can look forward to in life through your eyes.
Where is flash?
Roman you don't have to apologize all the time. Just do what ever you want to do Sir. I will always be here as a fan.
We love too watch your family grow Roman <3
Hi Roman and fam be carful because cats will eat chicks🛐✝️
The sunshine hat is the most fitting for smile more :)
no hate but i’m wondering how come they’re not wearing masks?
Roman at 9:05 to 9:08😂😂
Take precautions regarding the cats and the chicks..I had some many bad experience 🥲🥲
I’ve been in the same mood when it comes to my YouTube, I need to stay consistent and stop trying to outdo my last video! Just live your life and film, it doesn’t matter what it’s about!
I hope your Dad keeps working on his art. It's GREAT!
I love these types of vlogs showing what u do isn’t that the whole reason behind a vlog is to show your everyday life
Love Watch ill watch any  time you  post 😁😎🙈🙉🙊🎃🎄📷🐶🐱🐓🐔🐣🐤🐥
Thanks for leaving us hanging!
You do you man< inspire me anytime dude!
Just put something out every week and u won’t disappoint anyone!
I have chickens
Chickens like to take dust baths to get rid of bugs/parasites. You can purchase fine dust from Tractor Supply and put it in a container for them to roll around in.
Roman I love the videos like these and showing the animals.
The majority of us - and me, love these kind of normal arround the house videos. You don't need to inspire to make people happy. Just seeing you post makes me happy so no need to make anything "over the top". Good luck guys!
Are used to have chickens but somebody stole them all 😞
Your the most inspiring person on the internet
Kids let's have more kids😐😂😂😂😂😂
They only put out vlogs when they want to sell gullible people their trash.
Just do what you gotta do, I enjoy every single video.
been here since 100k
I like the smiley hat S/M
Yeah rowman it's called getting old just settling down
Just hit record man we love it!
For me I just enjoy feeling like I’m hanging out with you guys. Just enjoy watching your vlogs. Love your family.
Where are the masks?!
We love j the blogs we hang around with you guys
I Have had chickens all my life You should try to get some silky's or some Polish Chickens
I enjoy this video. I'm animal lover and I want to see your chicks grow
Roman keep making video even if it not entertaining I will always watch you!
I love the balloon
Well funny enough more folks are wearing masks now in WA since folks are mostly vaccinated. Super silly here in the NW.
9:07 he said "😂😐"😂😂
I honestly believe Roman has lost the passion for YouTube, he should just hang it up and enjoy family life.
are we bot gonna tell them? what?  are they pregnant again?
I WANT VLOGS OF ANY AND EVERYTHING!!!😭 it doesn’t matter what you post, I’ll always watch
When are yall going back to hawaii or the bahamas this summer
Roman (inconsistency) Atwood
Do u still ride the dirt bikes
My mom has raised chickens for over 20 year's along with other fowl's and one of the best thing's is watching eggs hatch in the incubator and they don't all hatch the same so it's always an interesting sight
As a veterinary nurse, this vlog was VERY entertaining to me lol
I love it this way just simple hanging out with you guys in your day to day. Don't feel like you have to top yourself. All of your content is fun to me.
I actually like watching these kind of videos an it’s kinda inspiring to watch these kinda of videos
This is entertaining... and inspiring and uplifting... this is exactly what true Atwood fans love about you guys 💕
Roman I've been watching you for yrs and yrs and I think you need to decide if you want to be a YouTuber or not!! Js
10:30 ; we honestly just love watching u guys. you dont have to entertain us
U should sell those egg's in a store
I’m convinced Cora is Brian’s daughter
I like the calm family vlogs the most :) do a Housetour?
Roman we will watch no matter what I look forward to ur videos
Worst channel on YouTube, seriously not even one slightly entertaining video since you've come back.
roman these videos are great man these videos are entertaining and inspirational. but i wish u could go back to daily vlogs.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
My boss owns chickens, so when I go up to work, I have to feed and clean them along with doing my other work
Thank you for everything you do I am really enjoying all your videos
I'll watch it all! Would love to see your dad and bro's family...see what's up

THE CLIFFHANGER IS ENTERTAINMENT ENOUGH
Where is flashy??
Only OGs remember the OGs    🙄

Loved the video! The video was entertaining don’t stress about that. We love you!
Love you guys 🙂
U gotta love these kinds of intros man
How is your dad and your brothers family...  so many people we miss ❤
Roman if you just do a movie about your week I feel like everyone would enjoy it no matter what it’s about
I’m literally not going to keep watching these videos. 😔
wear a fuckin mask bro.
you dont need masks anymore??
Get a guard goose!
Man, it's good to see you guy's
I love all you video rights keep uploading
If you get two roosters you will get more eggs i think it's 1 rooster to every 12 chicks.
That look  Knox gave at 12:40 🥺🥺
Roman most of us don’t care about entertainment we just love seeing you and your beautiful family everyday it brings me joy to watch these videos
I love hanging out with you guys. 🤗🤗
Just seeing your everyday life is very inspiring
dosent post for weeks, comes back selling us product to make money off us smh
are you going to show us the rest of the house and some of the things that you guys decided to hide for now, like the food pantry and all of the goodies to make me really hungry?
Loved this today
4:45 Roman is trying to say that they didn’t eat the chickens but all they’re talking about is food related things- HMMM “Sweet” “First to get eaten” “Like going shopping for ice cream. There are so many flavors”
Inspirational is always entertaining and a double whammy
I think it’s great that you want to inspire and you should keep doing that but don’t turn out like Shaun duras
Inspire > entertain any day of the week if you ask me. Thanks! <3
Just do as you used to say and "raw vlog" roman! We are not here to see all the crazy things you used to do daily for us, we are here to see you and your family well and happy
I literally love these types of vlogs, even if it’s just a family vlog it’s amazing!!! I missed these types, there were like super entertaining vlogs years back then like chill family ones inbetween
Roman all your videos have never been bad just post what ever we’re here for you
I'm happy with any content this was amazing had fun watching us,.... on the other hand and using a incubator is it confusing and difficult process from the experience that I gathered
I love the raw vlogs of you just showing your life
These vlogs are the best! Just you and your happy family!❤️
Love the vlog energy keep it up keep enjoying life
Do you still have the GTRs and the Red Truck Roman ?
Where is Flash?
Even if your vlogs aren’t “entertaining” they are still entertaining to all of us lol
That cliffhanger tho!!! Ahhhhhhhhh lol
Okay cliff hanger!! Lol
Its videos like thise i want. Not your fancy videos. I want more of this.
Love the chickens I think a channel that builds a garden and chickens and animals and raised till they begin producing and just all the steps an information and tips and tricks would do well with a solid personality I know there’s a few but their equipment sucks and their not entertaining their dry.
Where is Flash? I haven’t seen that dog in ages.
Everything I've seen you post over the last seven years has inspired and entertained me. I appreciate you and always look forward to every video.
Stay strong roman its good to see you again love the videos
I have a broken wrist too
I don’t care what you post to be honest I just love to watch you and I just makes me smile every day
Just to let you know this is entertaining
Ur father is an absolute artist❤️
Yes I like these types of videos
We have chicken's and duck
The cliffhanger 🤔
I love the sunshine ☀️

Just seeing a little pieces of y'alls life is entertaining your family is so inspirational and as we grow we grow with you,you have made a great life changing channel and the whole world can't wait to see more
Get a rooster then you won’t need an incubator. And I’ve been though my share of chickens *ffa* Whatever you post is great, but I really enjoyed this vid ;)
Anyone know what’s the deal with Flash?

Does anyone else feel like him and Mr Beast would make the best collaboration?
I would love to see vlogs about your homeschool as I homeschool my kids as well.

CLICKBATE IS SO DUMB AT THIS POINT
Love your family so much
I would love to just see your normal daily vlogs again. No need to go crazy!

As Roman was talking about Nitro, my cat was bugging me to pet her
Grandma cursing was the highlight of the video for me 🤣🤣🤣
Live strem the chickens
This is entertaining to me. I enjoy watching your videos and watching your family more then all the fun stuff you do
What happened to country why don't he come to ur house
Where flash
The positivity in your videos is amazing. I am glad you are back. I missed you. I say let the videos come as the come. Unless it is something special do not plan anything. I can not have children so it is so much fun watching yours grow up!!
These are the kind of videos I like to watch
Family Family Family !

Where is flash
My heart, Mama is still apart of the vlogs, get well soon !❤️😭
You going to give someone a heart attack with that horn. Loud noises that scare me always make my chest hurt so much. I can just imagine at that grandmas age. I would drop like a stone
Roman, family vlogs are ENTERTAINING & INSPIRING. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself. Come back in three days to show us the rocks. Also, keep us updated on the chickens. I want to see them grow. It is simple stuff like that we want to see. Stop overthinking it.
Look at it this way family just loves hearing from family. You guys are like family to us. Anything kind of content is good content.
For a little bit I thought your cat was a chicken that blend in with all of the chickens
TELL US WHAT? ROMAN!!
I have chickens and if you have land and you don’t already have chickens just at least get 4 or 5 it still does a lot
I love these kinds of videos
My grandparents have 24 chickens that will soon start laying eggs.
WHERE IS NOAH ATWOOD????
You could be doing nothing and we would watch. You're like part of our lives when we have been watching this long. When you had to take a break for your safety it was like we lost a family member.
TELL US WHAT
Lol big cliff hanger
Get some lavender Orpingtons they are the best chickens you will own
How you gonna leave us with that cliffhanger?!
THE CLIFF HANGER THO NOOOOOO 😂
I have 6 chickens. They’re so funny and the eggs are 👌
I personally enjoy all your content
FLASH
Thank you for all the positive vibes! Much love since 2016!
Have another dog because Flash is not here.

ROMAN THIS IS THE BEST ENTERTAINMENT ON THE PLATFORMS, DO YOU THATS WHAT WE LOVE <3 <3

You've always been inspiring. Family and farming life is where you're at and it's entertaining.
Really enjoyed today’s vlog! Bought the new hats too :)
We missed you guys soo much :,)
So pointless melodramatic bullshit

Hey guys I got stuff to sell so I’m making a vlog after a month. I love my viewers when I have new stuff to sell.
No matter what I love watching you guys everytime you post!
WHAT ARE YOU NOT GOING TO TELL US ABOUT????
I have chickens they are great

If youre still watching them and you saw this comment. Just please remember that i had loved you with all my heart. Dont worry im moving on. Please dont comeback. Takecare of yourself.
I gotta agree. I like the sun hat the best.
love the raw, just animals and family vlogs. been watching for so many years, you guys are family for us. Much love, Smile More <3
Roman great vlog good to see u back. To be honest you could post washing dishes for 10mins and i would watch. The content doesnt bother me i will always watch xx
Where is flash??
We love to just see what you guys are up to and to get to hang out with you! We will love anything and everything you film!!
Mama still going strong 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
That hat tho 🔥
We love you
What’s with that cliff hanger at the end guys?
just love watching you and your family keeps me very happy
I rather the entertainment videos
Im happy happy just to see u all xxx anything u choose to put up on here is inspiring and entertaining we thank u xxxxx
I think we will all watch anything you post. I definitely do
Get a cow
Roman! Stop apologize for being human. Do whats best for you and your family.  The die hards will be no matter what. And the chickens are super cute.
you should do some fourwheeler videos
Absolutely LOVE just hanging with you guys going on YOUR journey. Nothing more, nothing less! Keep it up! And WaIT! What are you going to tell us? Now you have us hooked for next vid haha! Spill the beans! 💖☺️
As someone who skips through the big planned “entertainment “ blogs and only watches family vlogs.....more family “day to day” vlogs. Please
I much prefer these vlogs!
Tf
More inspiration and uplifting.  We also live seeing the real you and your family.  I like the entertaining vlogs every once in a while, just don’t feel like you have to entertain everyday.  I will be here to support you either way.
We love these videos too Roman! Seeing the family and farm and daily adventures is always inspiring!
Sure... leave us on a cliffhanger 😂
Where is flash? Haven’t seen him in the blogs for a while
Roman I like these videos u have been making me smile since I remember watching your videos but know it is our turn to let u does what u like
hatching chickens would be something you guys would enjoy very much!! however it takes alottt of research because it is a very hard thing to master and sometimes can do more bad than good.. but after you learn as much as you can about incubating, go for it. or wait for a broody hen.. and get a rooster. that’s very fun too! and less work. but have to have a rooster. good luck!
A cliffhanger really Roman lol
Get sheeps! They aren’t as smelly as goats
No masks in public for you and your whole family? We see you 👁 👁
20 min vlogs is just to mutch .. plz dont make so big once <333 !!
I personally love the raw vlogs more than the entertaining ones
If you want something to protect your chickens get a goose or swan or emu
Videos like this are very inspiring. Everyone should be lucky enough to create a family environment that is loving and supportive. Life goals.
Inspiration can be entertaining and entertainment can be inspiring
Where is flash? So glad yall r back!
You guys should get some ducklings
At this point my country is still on lockdown I have nothing to do ... so i'm  just happy to be able to put on youtube and watch something 🤣🙂
You need a heat lamp for the chicks. Thanks for another piece of your life. Hello mawmaw . Am missing you all ngl. Looking forward to the summer life of you all.
I love these family vlogs 👍 😊 👍 I wish i could say the same and get out of the city and live on a farm somewhere far far from all this madness. Don't have to worry about getting robbed, carjacker, shot etc. Maybe one day but for know it is what it is sad to say. The life is just so much peaceful out there. 😃 More 👍
Where’s flash
Maybe You need to watch Enzo knol he makes vlog in dutch but most of them are an hour and that everyday.
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ARE A VERY BIG INSPERATION TO ME AND MY FAMILY. THE LOVE YOU HAVE A SHOW US IN YOUR VLOGS ARE WHAT I LOVE.  NO MATTER WHAT YOU VLOG ME AND MY FAMILY WILL WATCH.
I don't know about you other guys but I'm entertained just by roman actually uploding a vlog🙂
Where is Flash??? And can we have a full new house tour?
Funny because I was just thinking that Roman is the only YouTuber that actually “made it”. Happy family, no controversy, Roman is the only youtuber that doesn’t rely on memes or drama.
big up all the Chicken peeps
9:07 that is the fastest I have ever seen Roman loose a smile 😅😂
Roman, you could cut grass blade by blade with scissors and I would watch it. Any video is a good video from yall
Hey Roman, I had chickens for a while and I learned it was dangerous to introduce new chicks into a group of grown up chickens because the grown up chickens tend to attack the newly introduced chicks
this is intertaning Roman what ever you post i love it
Roman this is fun and entertaining and inspiring I promise
Dear Roman, this video was entertaining and inspiring! Keep uploading! Smile more!
Tell us about what?! 💕💕
Give them your left overs. Your eggs will taste better
We are happy watching you guys do whatever you want to do. ❤️
So happy your back!!! So nice to sit down with my son and watch your vlogs. It's alittle time out of the day to sit down and relax with him.
Why doesn't roman hire a personal filmer?
Hey Roman When the house tour???? Grady vlog tho
I think you're focusing too much on making the video about something when the whole point of vlogging is just videoing and showing what you're doing day to day. Thats the whole point, there doesn't need to be a topic, or a theme to the video or a plan. its just you and the family being you, that's what most people are here for. At least that's what I am here for.
He should make a live of just his chicks
You are at a different stage of life.  A good stage.  Sober, new direction, without loosing the real entertaining you.
Mine's the bloon
9:08 Romans reaction had me weak lol
Honestly I’ve been with y’all since 5 years ago. Y’all shoUld just bounce of YouTube. Stop trying to please others with your joy. FEm
Just being you is the inspiring part! Vlogs, movie doesn’t matter. You inspire me to be a better person and dad to my kiddos with every video you put out.
Watch White House on the Hill YouTube Channel.
COME BACK TO DUBAIIII WE MISS YOU ❤️
Try not to make your mama grandma jump of a skin have a heart attack
that cliff hanger... lol
Chickens are sooo beautiful and its so fun to have them
where the GTR
Ruralking is one the better stores nowadays such a nice store so many exclusives

Cliffhanger 🤙
cora is just a cute princess...i like family vlogs roman keep them coming
i’m convinced it’s hard to hate roman and his family
Are you not gonna tell us what??!? 😭😭😭
You should show the new vehicles
Roman no matter what you post you and your family, make me smile to see how far you guys have came
WHy ArE ThEY Not WEaRiNG MaSKs?!  !
Turn the camera on and see where it takes you. We will follow your journey 😊
I miss my chickens
Awesome to see you guys... And especially without masks.  It's really refreshing and gives me hope.   Please pray for My Country (India) we are going through a very rough time.
HI ROman i probs missed it but where is Flash
BEST family channel on YOUTUBE.
These are my favorite kind of vlogs ❤ Keep doing you!! ❤
Love the real life vlogs.🖤
I've always been inspired even you are playing around
Ireland still have mask around places :(
Feels like it's just about merch these days... :-(
Last comment vlog everything no stopping that's my plan raw as raw can be me for me
any vlog just post . . you make my day complete sir . .
Those hens were dust bathing. Helps keep them clean and pest free
where’s flash pls show flash in the vlogs
Just do what you like, I’ll be here no matter what
I love both the action and family vlogs!! If I can give a suggestion why don’t you put like a life lesson to the vlogs? Like a lesson that maybe you just learned or some thing you want to share or even for the kids!
"Wait are we not going to tell them about..." WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO US?!! lol
Trust and believe we just wanna see you
That’s one way to make your kids go prematurely deaf
We are all your ride or die...
I love the new content.
Keep FIlming... no matter what it is
As longest you post a video I get entertained it could be the simple video ever and I would love it
I like your videos and have been watching since yous were on tanked but you shouldn't be endorsing not wearing a mask especially with the amount of cases in the us
That little “wait are we not gonna tell em about” “no” at the end for me excited for the next video already😂😂
Roman... We don't need entertainment... We watch you because we like to see how you're doing in your life. We enjoy seeing your daily life. If u don't feel like filming then don't. If u feel like doing a full vlog then do it... If u want to something exciting and entertain then do that. We will be here no matter what you give us.
why dont u do a serial here and do like a reality show and film the daily life ?? like u doing  every day stuff
Only the true subscribers/OG's will remember the pranks before the vlogs even existed boom
I dont care what you post just like hanging out with yo u guy
I have this one rooster that run up real close to you but not attack, he's a sweetheart.
We're are your masks ?🤨
All we need Roman is a weekly update on you and your family
Where is flash?
Can we have a full house tour yet?!
Wait Cora has beautiful brown eyes now
I got 7 chickens and 5 ducks
Damn everyone mask was off? Wow that fast lol , I'm vaccinated and still have mines with me lol
I’ve been watching for so many years now, lost count. At this point I just want to see you and the family, doesn’t really matter what you guys do
We’re jealous over here in Canada that y’all don’t have to wear masks .... 😢 in BC anyways
I think you put to much pressure on yourself to out do your self or be entertaining. I can’t speak for everyone but I think a lot of people watch because they enjoy your family. Less pressure more fun. Film what you want.
The lay back vlogs and family ones are my favorite
Just love the vlogs where we just “hangout” with the family ❤️❤️ long time fan of you guys ❤️❤️
What happened to flash??
I enjoy these vlogs and i think its entertaining in its own way. Whatever you feel like doing is where my vote is at! ❤️
Roman, your positivity IS entertaining! We love you guys and whatever content you share with us!
Love you guys! Can't wait to see the baby chicks grow :D They are so cute and adorable! And knox is getting so big so quick.
Honestly I would rather watch these types of vlogs than the over the top ones 🤷‍♀️
What!!!!!! You have to tell us the thing now
Can I have some g fuel 😂
No matter what roman with every vlog you guys lift me up and everyone just seeing yall smile it make me smile keep it up man love yall take care❤❤
Who remembers that roman was about to organize YouTube destruction derby
When Ma Ma said a bad word, that made my day!
You left us on a cliffhanger! What aren't you telling us!!!
I love this family.  It's great to see Mawmaw doing well. I hope Curt Atwood is well, too.
I love these type of videos Roman! No pressure! Follow your heart and do what makes you happy 💛
So awesome to see you guys again! I miss seeing Flash!!
I had chickens, ducks, donkeys, goats, bunnies, guinea pigs, dogs, cats, a parot, a squirrel, fishes..... Ummm.. now that I come to think of it, I had a lot of animals.....
The sun hat looks like more positive energy
I’ve got chickens
If u do get goats there’s a benefit they eat all the poison ivy on your property
ahhhh not a cliff hanger
i have 2 turkeys and 6 chickens, good peeps !
I have another 3 years of suffering in school (because of the people in it) and you videos no matter if I had a bad day makes the day great
🐔

We are family and no matter what content you put out we are so blessed to see you all! @romanatwood
why dont u film the work u do at ur house / ranch and build some cool  wooden stuff. or  like start doing some  DYI  stuff and  family stuff.
I have chickens (256 chickens to be exact)
You inspire us everyday.  Whether you film yourself just talking, family vlog, or driving a bus into a pond, we just love clicking on your videos every week.  Don’t feel pressure to try to “entertain” us all the time. You don’t owe us anything.  All love, smile more!
TELL US WHAT????? OMG.
I think your over thinking it we are here just to see your days and get inspired that’s the entertainment be naturally you like the good ole days
God has a plan for me to be a successful artist one day 🙏🏽💯🔜🤍
The channel is now entering a beautiful new chapter
Any video you put out is entertaining and inspiring
Fun fact! Cats doesn't like that their water and food is near each other. So maybe put the water in one room and the food in another room! ;)
Can we have house update, what happened to the GTRs and Clifford the big red truck
I have chicken
watch all the vlogs and love them all :D
Fr cliff hanger😂😂😂😂
Just be you
I got chickens and love them. The rooster on the other hand is a pain 😂
Roman you should definitely get a cabinet incubator & have the kids hatch a bunch out!! It is so much fun hatching them out from start to finish!! I have a cabinet incubator & we have hatched out thousands and thousands of chickens, bob white quail, bantams, ducks, Guennease, pheasants, turkeys, & several others!! It was definitely very fun trying to make sure everything was set right at the right time of the process of incubating!! You should definitely give it a try!! I mean really chickens only take 16 to 18 days to hatch out!!
I like the everyday kind of vlogs were we just follow you along everywhere and see what you are actually doing.
I've ya roman and fam u are awsome and a inspseration much love and respect
Would love for you to change gears like you are to inspirational videos rather then “entertainment”. Especially living out on the property that you do....love the animals and being able to live vicariously thru you guys😃 I had chickens back in the day and fell in love with them so I’m super excited to keep up with your babies😄🥰
Tell us about what not fair hey tell us
You guys should get llamas!
I’ve been watching you guys since I was in the seventh grade now I’m graduated from college and I’ve loved watching you guys every day when you guys were vlogging  everyday but now you guys still vlog on occasion and you think your every day life isn’t entertaining which it is that’s why we all watch you of just your every day life you can inspire people as you show your every day life, I Watch to see you and your family and what you guys are doing no matter the continent!!!!!!!!!
Roman...... any video is great!!!! You don't have to go out of your way to 'entertain'. Go back to OG vlogging where you just show us what you are doing in your life! Your daily routine, thats what us Roman Soldiers want! Like if you agree
Awww I miss u come back
Those whistle notes at the beginning tho
What did u have to tell us!!!!???
Best family on YouTube 💯🙏🏼
My grandpa also collected rocks and tumbled them
"Leaves with three, leave them be!"  "Or Stomp on 'em"!  HAHA
Roman ill watch whatever you vlog it doesn't matter what you put.  Im sure I can speak for millions of us
Nice romen
We need more uploads like this
We have chickens :) !!!
I love your normal, everyday vlogs! Always have, always will. 💙
I love watching ALL vlogs. Watching Roman and his family brings happiness and sadness to me once i see his videos. Makes me happy because me and my mom LOVES/D watching Romans videos. Its sad cause I no longer have my mom to watch them with me. His videos have brought us so much joy watching them. He helped me get through my moms passing.
Only og's already know to recognize the girl with the b00bs who writes a lot of "only og's remember" s for likes in the comments
Smile More bucket hats?????
Put that rock tumbler in the shed. So loud. So much fun though
Luv u Atwood
this is so entertaining and uplifting i need at least a vlog a week to be happy🤣
I have had chickens for 5 years now and like you said always a chicken owner always a chicken owner
I like the raw family vlogs a lot better than the entertainment videos
Was anyone else so happy to see mama
Where is flash
Roman somehow knows when my day is just going bad cause he always posts when i need it most
Were is flash
Roman what is that ending? What is it?
So borrrrrreing
Turn to Jesus. Repent and spread Gods word. He loves you and always will. God bless and have a blessed day
Best family on YouTube
I don’t even care what your posting I just wanna see the videos.
FAMBAMMERS love you
Patients in Manitoba are suffering and dying while waiting for treatment for illnesses not related to COVID-19 because the health system is overwhelmed, a group of doctors said at a news conference Tuesday morning. While in BC they are beginning to inset re-start yet Canada is not ready to not work masks yet. or to open up our borders.  Uplift and inspire. then there's India.
They are probably going to be baking up a storm with all of those eggs they are going to have everyday
I don't own chickens but we have Japanese Quail and King Quail.
We have chickens in etna !
Now you have to tell us!!!!! haha
Damn you both with those cliffhanger Endings. Good to see you back doing so.e kind of video
No matter what .. we all watch you because you are an awesome YouTuber. No matter what video ..we want to watch you and your family on what you are all doing. I love watching your videos no matter what video. :)
Did flash pass away?
Glad to see mawmaw again!
Where is Flash? We haven’t seen him since chapter 3 started
Any video made i will watch and enjoy🤩😎
It's so crazy that watching your videos got me through high school and was my childhood and now I'm an adult you've literally been apart fo our lives. Zeus was the best
you inspire me even tho you having a though time you still get up and  be productive with vlogs or family and that inspires me to not just stay being a lazy bum but to get up and productive since im a big guy trying to lose weight and been accomplishing it little by little  love you guys hope you and the family have a great yearand hope to meet you in person soon
I've always enjoyed the "family" vlogs, and I've been around for a while, just don't always comment. As your lives change, so shall your vlog content, it's only natural :)
My step parents got given chickens a couple years ago
I had 6 chickens but 3 of them died now I only have 3 left and still have to many eggs
Can we get a gun update?
Comment how much chicken 🐔 you have I have 9
Duck eggs taste way better, but they're so much harder to take care of.
Damn they dont need to wear masks lucky but give it a month and you gonna hear that they have like stage 5 lock down because COVID over runned everyone lol
do what makes you happy roman
Where’s Flash 🐕
Love u man
Does he still have the 2 gtr
Wait, y’all don’t have to wear a mask there?? 😷
Roman the birds are doing their version of dust baths. Also, check Weed 'em and Reap, Adler Farms, Arms Family and Justin Rhodes on YouTube. I think you will love them. They are family friendly, small farm or homestead and have awesome, uplifting, hilarious channels.
13:25 those words actually helped me i was literally thinking that today that what happened to me i was never going to forget and i will have panic attacks about it for the rest of my life but you literally made me hopefull that i was going to get through this. Thank you Ps. I want more chickens
NOOO I MISS THE OG OPENING SOUND ♥️😢
I love you guys so much.......the baby chickens are so cute
Look at all those chickens
Love these endings after your outro haha
I could just watch you guys do nothing all day and be happy
The proposal movie, with the chicken 😂😂😂
left on a cliff hanger
The Atwood's have been inspiring me and entertaining and been a personal blessing for me for a decade and many more to come. God bless love ya guys
My daughter and her husband looks like you two! Wish I could send you a pic.
Not gonna tell us what??????? I’m going crazy
We just need a little Roman Atwood in our lives....just you being you and nothing like trying to wow us. Thanks for sharing your day!!
Don’t vlog to entertain, vlog to inspire us to be ourselves like you are
i hope y’all are vaccinated.
You guys been my top fav YouTubers for yrs! Think you guys having fun, do what you guys do is very entertaining!  My other fav YouTubers is Weed em and reap...city farm life. Thought I'll mention it since you guys are getting into that now. Check em out! Thanks for the video! Can't wait to see you guys more!!!
THE CLIFF HANGER!!!!
Keeps the vids going I love what Your doing keep the camera rolling
Those hens are getting dust under their feathers, it’s help with bugs!
As someone who is older now too n grew with you guys I love this stuff. watching your fam we garden for fun now n to you inspire me to be a better parent
I much prefer this kind of vidio actually
I just wanted to hop on here and make a comment about how much i truly enjoy watching your video’s. They take me out of a dark place and brighten my day. You are an inspiration to me, you push me to be a more positive person for my family. I think I speak for a lot of people here when I say I don’t care what you post i just want to see how you guys are doing! It’s honestly so weird to say because I’ve never met you but you’re a part of our family! We love you guys! Please post more. ❤️❤️ When your videos pop up i instantly get excited to hear how you’re doing!!!
Obviously, I don't know what every else is thinking, so I can only speak for myself, but I  personally love videos like this that are just what you all are doing. I know some people maybe don't like this type of video, but there's plenty of other channels for those people. Anyway, I think you should do whatever you enjoy doing, and know an audience will come to you. Anyway, I hope everyone's feeling good and smiling more than anything else :)
Are you coming out with a pride collection??
I love this style vidio
well if you post you entertaining and uplifting.  you might not notice because you do it each vlog but you guys do
The hats are cool but the hats shape is weird I bought the same style from nelk and the bull is so long
We're is flash ?
U r awesome Roman love ur video
Inspiring is good for me. You  and your lovely family have always done that for me. Keep your chin up and keep smiling.
I have chickens

Anything from Atwood family is amazing.  Just seeing you and the family make me happy. Thank you ☺️
Where is flashyyy!!!!,

Uplift through entertainment
I’m just here for the fun!
sun hat
As an Ohioan and having gone to the store a few times without a mask it feels so good to be able to smile at people! That’s something that’s been missing from the world for so long and I think it’s taken a negative toll. So glad to be able to show my smile again!
I love this every day around the house/inspiring vlogs! Love everything you make!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am so glad you took my advice and rewatched some old stuff! Now you’re getting it!! YOU DO YOU and we will all watch with complete smile’s!!! Love just watching the stuff you do daily with your family! Like you said!! It’s all about what makes YOU happy! That’s where the inspiration comes from!! We see you and all seems ok in the world! THANK YOU!! 🥰🥰🥰❤️💜❤️💜❤️💕💕💕👌🙏🏻😁
Idc how u want to do it. I enjoy every style you done. If u want to every other day, every 2 to 3 days later, or twice a week
I prefer every day living
I just like all your videos, it doesn't matter what you do, I love it all!!
I love these vlogs
Love the family just chillin vibe! Love seeing you guys all back on cam! ( also that clif hang at the end!? )
stan roman and their family for not wearing a mask
I like the chill vlogs
Just do you bro that's all any one wants 🇳🇿🤙❤️
you can inspire one day and entertain another day or you can do it both in the same day.
we need some pond content
Tell us about what?....🤔
The family everyday vlogs are great keep doing them
I just got covid and then you post this amazing vlog. I forgot my anxiety watching this
Hey your your doing just fine with your vlogs.thank u being there.
Atwood family homestead vlogs.
Who else thinks Roman’s dad can make his own successful YouTube channel
Hi Roman and family. I been following you for years, and i see the time change. We all get older, and things in life change us. You have had a lot of challenges and are hurt by it. You are not free to show your life like before, and that really put a rope on you. To be a person that can support or entertain it is important that people belive in what you do. You have been gone for a long time, and every time you have to take a break, and say sorry, you get distanced from us the Atwood family :) I wish you do what makes you happy, and that make you and your family happy and safe. Give Mama a big hug from Jan in Norway. I wish you all the best
Just watching what you posted right now is entertaining to me I love seeing the family
I have always loved the "normal" VLOGS where you just go around with the camera, and take the day as it comes. Like back in the good old daily vlogs. :) I'm sure many will agree with me.
❤️
😀
To me, the vlogs are both entertaining and inspiring.
Is mawmaw Romans or Britney's grandmother? Also which parent?
My preference on chickens are it's my life goal to get all the species of chickens and one of the species of chickens that makes the difference colors of eggs and let him Free roam with all the female's and incubate every single last egg the girls lay and Go from there
I really want to see your dad
I love the content as it is now !
Out in public not wearing a mask! 🤦🏽‍♂️
Can you make a smile more visor? They are more of a female headwear. 😀
Family ❤️
More movies as well
I like the 'just rolling the camera' vlogs. We get to come along for the ride as you make memories.
THAT ENDING THO!!!! Hmmmmm suspense!!!!!!
Where I live in canada were still in lockdown, probably indefinitely. Can't wait for things to go back to normal.
Would you ever get flash Back
I don’t watch the vlogs to be entertained, I watch them to feel connected to someone other than the people I see everyday. It’s just a get away from the real world for 10 minutes. I preferred this vlog today over any of the more “entertaining” vlogs like the dishwasher one. So happy you guys are back 💕
Why don’t kids go to school?
I use to have a farm of chickens I had 50 at some point
I like the everyday chill vlogs
Been raising chickens for.... 5, maybe 6 years now. I love them so much! Lost most of my flock over this winter and am working to build it back up. I currently have 4 hens and one roo.
You should get a silky chicken and a Easter egg chicken... the silly’s are really fluffy  look them up.. and the Easter egg chickens lay different color eggs I don’t know what there called though
And this is why America's cases are so high, cause people don't wear masks. Meanwhile here in the UK we're still wearing masks.
Just you vlogging your day like this is more than enough.... I love watching your family xxx
Do a TED TALK for us channel
I live watching people just living their every day life and showing what’s going on. It feels like I’m either a part of your family or I’m a best friend and I’m coming along with your day. It lets me escape my day to day life. So don’t worry about entertaining us. I think we al just want to see your faces more often and grow that friendship and family attachment like before.
I enjoy watching people who do. Normal things
Come to England, still masks here 😂
We have chickens but they Produced made eggs yet
What was she gonna say at the end
Yeah mumm back
Please bring back daily vlogs.
NO WAY…. IS SHE PREGNAT AGAIN … YESSSSSSS  Between the comment where Brit said “let’s have more kids” and the very very end…. Idkkkkk man
No matter what you put out...we love to see it
bro.. what a cliffhanger?!?! tell us what? baby #5?
What an ending 😂 dang it now I got to binge watch some vlogs.
These style vlogs are the best, we need more ❤️
its so fun to see Roman talk about chickens 😂 i have 15 chickens and they're so cool and they are the best investment. we dont really eat that much eggs so we sell them, make homemade noodles out of them and sell that too.
I say u should just record what ever u do your daily life I love any video u do
Miss you guys amazing video
Real family life,can’t be beaten
Do more stuff like 3 years ago
Is no one gonna talk about that cliffhanger at the end?
Theres chickens that lay rainbow eggs
This vlog kinda marks the end of an era, and I think its ok. I am really looking forward to see you being just a dad and giving us youre advice on life.
You always entertain us even if you’re just doing house stuff you’re still entertaining and inspiring

Ik there’s no masks but hopefully you guys are vaxxed up to be safe. Especially mama
We also have Chickens and have had Chicks in the past. A two little tips are to Dip the chicks beaks in the water when you first put them into their new environment and then also check their butts often for pasty butt! Smile More!!
More pranks roman lol we miss them. We also miss country and Pablo.
Get a goose it will protect the chickens
Hiiii I’m a chicken owner
Roman any you post is amazing! you bring smiles to all of our faces! and we like seeing what your day is abt! keep doing it! 💗
This is entertaining for me. Keep it up 👍🏽!
anyone else still watching him to support him?
Don’t worry about it Roman, I totally understand in the position that you’re in right now, my dad has gone through the same stage of life that your going through. Right now you’re in place where it’s about family and I highly respect that. I honestly don’t mind at all what path you take, whether entertainment or inspiration, regardless I always enjoy watching your videos. God bless you and your family!
When you get the eggs leave one and they will have Moro
Can anyone tell me what jumper Knox is in?

We grew up watching you everyday doing what you do it doesn’t matter to most of us if it’s not the most entertaining it’s just   about hanging out for a little bit
We need an update on both of the GT-Rs
Love when they post because this what I want my family to be like

Please post more often regardless what it is
Where’s the doggo flash been
Love you guys 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
👍🏼👍🏼🌞
Simle more 😃
It is the most awesome video watching a beautiful family just being a loving family! That is uplifting and inspirational!  Show these viewers what a real normal, loving family looks like. This is what the world needs is to see happiness!
I love every kind of Roman Atwood and family videos
Moma !  So glad to see her too. 💞💞🙏🏽🙏🏽
I like the farming vlogs!!
I got chickens
Roman, you and your family made me who I am today. I will always be here and will always stick around as long as you guys are happy I don’t mind what the content is.
The family vlogs like what you did today is the kind of content I love!!
I prefer this content all day, i prefer this any day over driving a bus into a lake and other ridiculous stuff lol keep going even if the views aren’t what you expect the real fans love this stuff
Just be you....
Roman has 3 kids but he's not sure how to fertilize and hatch eggs.
aren't you gonna tell us about what exactly ??!!!
Am I the only one that says the outro with him? Pls say I’m not!
Wheres flash?
More inspiration!!!!!!! Have really really loved seeing the vids!
i loveeeeeeeeee you vids i like the sun one the most
I have chickens. Rhode Island red.
This was actually entertaining because your family is so beautiful
TELL US WHAT, WHAT?!!?!?!??!?!!?
You have always been inspirational in everything you have posted. So I would say just pick the camera up and film. You always have a positive out look on life and that’s what people love about you
Plain family vlogs are the best. No need to overthink Roman
They dont have to wear a mask? we are still in a lock down in ontario canada
Love to you and the fam Roman
Where is flash
I love this type of video
I'd much rather have you inspire us, show us your life, and things you're doing and learning, over being entertained.   We currently have 13 egg laying chickens and 12 broilers that we will butcher in a couple weeks. They are the best!
"The End Is Near" "Smile More"
I don't care what you do I just want to see a video from you. I have been watching since 2014 and I am 14 right now.
You could do weekly vlogs but instead of just filming on one day film here and there throughout the week and put it together in one. That’s pretty common these days 😊
Sun had to be the best one.
Does anyone know what happened to flash haven't seen him in the videos in awhile.
Best decision I ever made was getting goats lol, 100% get some goats
i love the heart  and rainbow x
hi
I love the sun!
👍
I missed this man🔥🔥🔥
You should just get a videographer and editor to film your day to day
Where’s flash ?
All for the inspiration Roman! 🙏🏻❤️
Always love your videos and family life, miss the funny videos but I’m going to watch whatever you put up
I've got chicken's
only Roman can make me smile from one notification
Religion inspires nowadays before christ is was wife's I'm actually alexander the great
tell us about what ?????
honeslty bro im gonna be as real as i can be right now, and i think everyone can agree on this. You shouldn't have to pick up the camera and have to out do yourself, just be yourself, be true thats what makes your videos good. There is no need to be having to out do yourself because you think its what everyone wants. Videos like theses were like videoing what your doing in the day is a good video to have on the side while doing something or even sitting here watching it. And also dont listen to anyone, unless its gonna help you or the will help you.
I had that moment today, today was my daughters last day of Pre K picking her up I’m like holy shit she’s going to Kindergarten like her school journey is about to begin she’s no longer A baby I miss it. Luckily she’s still A daddy’s girl and I always get random I love you’s but I was thinking soon I won’t get them I started to make myself upset had to stop it.
Entertain Through Inspiration
I love your videos. I like the real life stuff. Love the little baby chicks
LoL
Cora is so cute and she is growing up so fast 🥰
Don’t get goats they eat everything I had 3 and had to get rid of them they where even chewing on my horses tail at one point
rural king chickens are notoriously treated terribly and always dying.... yikers
Lol I love the ending little chic moment!!!! So cute
Thank you for making me SMILE MORE.  Inspiration is what I need right now, I am still being stalked right now and it is hard to move forward without being afraid.  I am giving everything to GOD right now so prayers are needed.  Thank you
Cora is such a sweetheart 😍
What happened to flash just just
We still like seeing your daily life! Its vloging your daily life what ever it is! You dont need too make all vlogs fun filled and crazy entertainment the real fans that want too watch your daily life will and the rest will watch when its something more entertaining! We love you and realize your life cant be all fun and game and you have regular athome stuff too do!
I started to raise chickens I think two years ago for the first time and now they have grown all up and we can't keep up with eggs and eating them all so we give them to our neighbors so they have eggs as well
Cmon man I’ll always love watching your videos, you’re my childhood
Alexander the great inspire or
I think I can speak for many when I say we would watch every single video even if you just said blah blah blah the whole time
This family’s positive attitude literally makes my day every single time.
I’m having fun watching this video !!!
Wait you guys don’t have to wear masks anymore
I love y'all Roman I miss yall
tell us about WHAT! jk love the vids keep up the good work
wtf...you can't leave us with a cliffhanger like that....
Love watching u guys..its nice to see your family living your dream..it definitely inspires..Just be you!!❤❤💕💕💕
Your dad is so creative! Does he have a shop?
Roman is one of those youtubers that can come back and film the same content and we always love it
yikes not wearing masks in the store... you'd think yall would be a better example for your fans
nice
Roman looks like you gotta watch some more Gary Vee or go visit him and sit down and talk. Just document.
Tell me tell me I can’t wait to find out lol
i would love to see more of ur life like ur family and all your plants! lol
I wish I had property to have chickens and goats. I’d love to see you have a huge veggie garden!!! That would be awesome!!!! Start the garden now while the chicks are little and you can compare their growth!!! They will produce around the same ish time!!! I love watching you guys have fun!!! I LOVE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have so many.   I think people love you guys because you’re real and you aren’t stuffy jerks. (Not from what I’ve seen anyway, LOL 😉.) I and so many, can relate to everyday life…..kids, house, business, chickens, plants…etc!!!!!!   Yay!!! TOMATOES 🍅!!!   Film your own life…..we want to see more!!!  What a cliffhanger………..🤔🤔🤔
well im eating a chicken breast currently so theres that
DIDNT SEE FLASH AT ALL IN THIS VLOG :(
I miss Zeus 😭😭😭😭
who else skipped to see what he wanted to tell us!
What you are just doing is entertaining to me and many people
Just bought more chickens yestday at rural king! We’re up to 20 now!
If you put fencing on the top of the chicken run, then owls, hawks & eagles won't grab'm! Presuming that's how you lost some!
When I was a kid my dad's parents you to have a small little Farm nothing crazy and they had chicken two of them what called sage and onion and the 2 used to lay a lot of eggs and I always founded that they taste a lot better than supermarket eggs
smile more
aww, i love the balloon one!
What’s crazy is your family IS our entertainment! We just wanna see how you guys are doing since we’ve grown up with you over these years!
Think it’s safe to say these are still interesting and we like these types of videos
I like the sun here and I like the heart at I have baby chicks to
I like the sunshine
Buy a electric brooder. It's much easier and safer then a heat lamp. It mimics a mama hen laying on her chick's.
Been here since the start and I ain’t going nowhere yes it would be nice if y’all starting posting more again ain’t gonna lie especially now that’s it’s summer but do you first smile more love y’all 💕
More farm ☺️ just follow your passion
Get a bigger air compressor and a Train horn. Hook it up to your truck. Head to a protest where they’re purposely standing in the street. Boom, content.
I love your family vlogs
it is your own decision, but i just wanna say that i always loved (and still do) the daily vlogs, they are about as raw as they come and that's what i love. but it is of course your own decision.
Full vlog watcher here! 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️😁
Train horns are the new Dab.  Ha ha I love Grandma’s reaction. Ha ha  What a fun family.
Where is flash at ??? Did he pass away or you give him away ????
Wow that cliffhanger tho🤭
Lmao I just love Cora’s borrowed outro🤣
Love you guys, you inspire and motivate me at least for today’s haha, my life’s been a mess lately and I’m tired of it, sometimes I just wanna leave and never come back to my family or daily life.  I been your fan/supporter since many years ago and I love the way you guys live, love and be so down to earth despite all the money you have. You are a great family 🙏✨
Wow she's so big now.
Jesus loves you
Nooo! you can’t just leave it on that endingggg  😂
tell us about what??? at the end 😂
I don’t care if your not doing anything that day it’s fine I jus like to watch you and the family
i love them they are entertaining to me
Brit: “Yeah, let’s have more kids!”  Roman: 😑
Hi to the whole Atwood family. Love you ALL. ❤💚💜💙💛
Through thick and thin, your og’s are here. It’s not always about entertainment.
👍
Love you video
I love theses videos keep just doing family vlogs.❤️❤️❤️❤️
😍😀
I completely understand the fact of wanting to inspire rather then entertain. Of course you entertain a lot of us, but that isn't why a lot of us watch you. Its because you inspire/inspired most of us. We've seen you go from nothing to something, all while you've stayed humble.
I like the hat with the sun 🌞
Missed you guys!!! 🥰
You should put out a video Monday and Friday so you can make everyone’s bad Monday’s better and make Friday’s even better😉
Roman, you do you my guy.
I just love to smile when I watch you, it's super entertaining
Idk but anything the Roman post is entertaining anything it can be words to uplift or stories anything just going to the store anything is entertaining because we value his hard work and dedication
Real supporters will always support you no matter what Roman! Roman Soldiers will always stay with you !
Would love to see your dad and brother in the vlogs again.
I have about 100 chickens and 50 ducks. I also have 4 geese and a lot of quail and rabbits. 😬😬😬
We like these videos I'm sure you will add in some fun stuff along the way maybe build a new pond slide at the new place.
For me I like the sun ☀️ shine hat 🧢
what a cliff hanger at the end!
Try challenging yourself for everyday vlogs like when you did 500 vlogs in a row
We have 32 hens, 2 roosters, and 15 Guinea Fowl
Love seeing you n the family. I enjoy the fun vlogs n ones just like this. Glad to see you guys back. One question where is Flash?
Maybe film a few minutes everyday like Charles weekend videos.
proud chicken momma here
Another Kid 🙈
Dont try to out do yourself every time thats when it gets boring for you and you will run out of ideas. What i love about about you channel is just filming whatever. And thats whats nice about it. Keep on smiling more and doing/filming what you want not what others want
Love the old school vlog. Thank you Roman for making me smile through the bad times.
I love your videos like this, there’s no reason to try and out do old videos we all change or morph into our new selfs so it’s normal that the videos would too. Love you guys and seeing the kiddos again.
Hi Roman Atwood I just want a Hi from you because today I need to smile more because your vlogs so can you please say hi please!! ❤️💙🙏🏻🙏🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸
make a channelcalled roman atwood farm channel pls love you guys
All your videos are entertaining no matter what
Nice, roman is a chicken owner.
honestly is it more worth it to just get the virus or to take the vaccines every year and u could still get it anyway
Love you guys!!! Roman if your having a rough day let brit take over!
It’s okay Roman I forgive you
I’m hitting a point in my life where I need inspiration, I’m going to college soon and life is getting crazy. Fun vlog or normal life is just fine. You’re da best!
It’s nice to see our childhood king back 😢🥳
We had chickens. When we get our own place well have more of them soon. Thank you for your vlogs, we've missed you guys.
We love you guys and your part of my life! Anything you vlog I love it. You motivate us to be better and do better in life❤❤❤
I love chickens / turkeys
Do you still have Flash? Haven't seen him in forever!
We love you guys no matter what you post! 🥰
I’m so happy that people are not wearing masks. People are finally realizing that Covid is just a virus
I have. About 30. Of them and it is great
I love the Sun Hat but my Second would be the Balloon!!
Roman don’t worry. Don’t feel pressured to film all the time. Take your time!! We will always be here💙💙💙
As long as you show your smile and your beautifull family it realy does not matter what you film. We will still keep watching. Smile more :D
I did rock tumbling
Bro hell yeah you just do you, everyone’s gonna appreciate the videos no matter what
I wanna know what the end thing is
Hello from the Uk 🇬🇧
You should definitely get goats we have one and I love her!!
We love anytime you post, no matter what it’s about!!!! 💗💗
Those last words in every video goes deep in my brain and make me happy
I just watch u guys just to watch
Am I crazy or have I not seen Flash in the videos for a while
i remember that vlog they drew the creepers with a sharpie love it
How is flash
I love the just natural life with the Atwoods, dont get me wrong the eventful stuff is cool too but the laid back stuff is just as good if not sometimes better . Keep up the blogs we love you
Tell us what 😕
Or were you at tractor supply
I’m living vicariously through you currently.  I have no family of my own but I know I will someday and your videos make me smile and laugh.  Blessed be.
You guys are so entertaining so much . You don't need to do anything roman just be yourself and your wonderfull family.  This is what I love the family  vlogs
From the beginning of the vid up till the end the video gained 3k likes
I watch a lot of YouTube that it is just about what they do every day around the farm. Just bring us along.
Isn’t it so funny how you(Roman) don’t think you’re “entertaining” people but look at the views, comments and likes, all you’re doing is filming yourself your family tending to your farm haha that’s kind of ironic. I’m kind of entertained laying on the couch watching this vlog haha. Well, just do what you normally do and film it. We all still enjoy watching what you guys do. At least to me seeing all of you as a family just living a “normal” life is different for me to see because my family isn’t so “normal” so you’re actually entertaining me and inspiring me at the same time to work towards that type of life
Love u Roman family  ❤️
Totally loving this if this could be every vlog id be happy
Wait tell us what?????? 😅😬
I still want entertainment blog from you guys just those inspire people they inspire me to whatever type of blog you put up you're going to inspire people because people have been watching you for so long now

God bless you and your family. Been watching since 200,000 subs
Other than everything else is ok. But otherwise I hope you guys can get out of the pickle you are in!

I got baby chicks they’re so adorable 🥰
All of your videos are entertaining to me. I just like that you post something. There all inspire to me
Its an awesome video so dont worry about it not being entertaining.
Wow its been so long since I have seen your vlogs. Last one I seen was when Cora was a new born. Anyway, I think you should just follow your heart man, make the kind of content you’re feeling. It doesn’t have to be one way or the other, just go with what you love doing. Much love for the Atwood fam
The person called “mom mom” is she romans grandma or Britney’s mom or grandma? Who is she?
Hey roman been watching since I was 7 I'm 20 now and you've always inspired me bc you went from nothing to something you are a inspiration I always thought you'd right a book though on your success story I will always watch
I love the chickens but Ples just vlog we don’t care what it’s we just want to see you and the fam
Guys it been an honor being in this channel but I think its time to move on
WAIT WHAT WAS THE ENDING?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!? DANG IT NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Just being able to watch one of your videos Roman is great and makes my day
As someone with a partner with long lasting hearing damage and tinnitus from loud noise I just want to remind people. Fog horns and other loud horns should only be used in emergency cases and never as a joke. Permanent ringing in your ears    extremely diminishes your quality of life. Be safe rather than sorry. :)
You hunt that property my guy?
Here since you chucked in JD in a go. Keep uploading that's it
So nice to see you all again!! Thanks for sharing. Our entire family has the notifications on to get your new videos. We will watch you guys do anything really. We love the fun vlogs, we love the family vlogs, anything you want to film and share we enjoy just seeing you guys having fun,and the awesome stuff you do while living life.  Our family is moving soon and we plan on getting chickens and goats and donkeys. We can't wait. So its fun for the kids to see your animals in the videos.  Thanks for always inspiring us. We have been tuning in for years and love giving our support. Love the new hats by the way. And also, the ending , tell us what?? What do you have up your sleeve now Roman?? Love you guys. We hope to be able to meet you all one day. Smile More 😃
that cliffhanger tho lmao anyways glad you're getting back into the swing of things, wish nothing but the best for you and your family
That was the point of the vlogs for you to record a record of your life we like just to watch and check in
You never have to apologize for needing time. We love everything you give us!
where is flash!>!>!>!>???!?!!??!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!? v
I dont have family.... so I watch and live thro you all !!!! <3
What did you need to tell us Roman?
I remember in middle school I used to watch this man daily and I still watch his videos when he uploads
Been here since the beginning and I'm nt going anywhere, your family is awesome, keep marching forward Roman soldiers
I have chickens and ducks
I loveeee those Hats! How do you even choose your fave?
I love watching you going about your day, those are my favourite vlogs.
Wait a minute about what😅

I used to have pet baby chickens when I was little :) cutest little babies! They love to follow you around! 🐥🐥🐥
Tell us about what???
100% with you what ever you decide to do its just nice to see you and the family back to normal with no big worries hanging over your head
That's not a airhorn that's a deaf ray
I love seeing you. You are awesome. I love you no matter what you do.
Just seeing Roman live his life is enough entertainment for me and probably a lot of us.
Anytime you post Roman it’s entertaining, you’ve always been at the point where if you post people always watch, no matter what because we are all Roman Soldiers and we love to smile! 😀
HUA
There videos make me happy love the Atwood’s so much there awesome
Ever since you came back its all been sad videos your not the same anymore. Get off YouTube find a regular job and move on. Your not IT anymore
Have you thought about ducks
I just get excited when a video is posted.   You and the family have been a major source if positivity in the last 4+years of my life.   It brings me out of my dark space I find myself in.   Keep doing what you do no matter how often you post.     I just keep watching old videos over and over when there isn't a vlog . 🥰🥰🥰
We not gonna talk about "are we not gonna talk about... You know" and just act like they didn't just leave us on a cliff hanger XD
Do daily pushups again
19:34 ??
Were you at Rural King
Me and my brother always watch you
The family vlogs are the best vlogs
I have chickens, ducks, turkeys, pot belly pigs, mini donkeys, goats and a rabbit
I would rather the family dad vlogs. As a father of two. And after installing a pool and doing gardening I get it man!!!
❤family❤
Where is Britney’s dog
Just tuning in!  I love that sunny hat soo much! But its to expensive for me. Maybe next time :) have  a nice day all
I'm gonna get the rainbow
Honestly, no matter what the video is about it’s super entertaining for me.
That was an evil ending!!! Tell us what??? :D
why they not wearing mask?
G.morning
Roman... tell us what you're really going through
hi
Keep inspiring Roman! No need to entertain.  Glad your back. Thank you for sharing
Your always sorry make up your mind you going clog or not 😡
You should just try and hatch a couple of your own eggs
bro damn i’ve been here since that video y’all watch damn been so long
No matter what you blog I'll support you 100 % I hope I can get my house pretty soon so I can get some chickens
Happy early birthday and we Share a birthday together
Hey.  My sister has 3 chickens in the backyard. They are so cute.
I want chickens so bad but we have dogs :/
I remember  that old video!
I rather vlogs like this. Just normal family days doing what y’all do. I think most would agree you don’t need to impress us with huge events every video! Love you guys!!
Love these vlogs
You inspire me everything you post and now I want chickens so a good care plan video would be awesome 😂😂😂
I love Maw Maw at the beginning. “Can’t say that” 😂
Cora has the cutest little voice ever! :)
I'm fine with laid back weekly videos showing the farm life
I have 80-100 chickens at my house
I miss Maw maw 😁 !
He left us like that...

I think you should just pick up the camera. I really like  the entertaining vlogs but I also really like the ones where you just pick up the camera and talk because these videos help distract me for awhile so that I don’t think about all of the bad shit that has happened to me lately.
I'm ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᶦᵏᵉˢ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ''''

Your beautiful you're one of a kind smile 💓 haven't heard that in minute and ngl and I kinda need it right now
Send a packet of skittles with one of the rainbow hats to a fan and a note that said taste the rainbow that would be funny
Love it! So cute love chickens. I think the goats would be fun too. I enjoy these blogs because ther more personal not all about entertainment even tho it very much is. I like the realness and it's inspiring on things with family. We got a rock tumbler at Christmas kids love it its fun to see the steps. Love yall have a blessed day!
people aren't looking for entertainment every video, most of your original fans just like your day to day vlogs on what ever you happen to be doing that day!
Insert massive eye roll here....yall lost this subscriber. Sorry.
I think most people like myself are invested in you & your family's journey, rather than entertainment. You have to do what is best & feels right for you.
I go sunshine 🌞 hat
Where's flash miss him
This is entertaining Roman!! And inspiring too :) don’t worry you keep doing this I love it. Your bring positives and smiles into my life ☺️ I love you and your family 💙

We have chickens but they like to become food for the wildlife around us. I stopped naming them.
I have chickens but we have to put them in a cage so me and my dad built a chicken coop for them cuz where I live there's Hawks but other than that they're super cool to have
Nooooo what were you going to tell me abouttt😭😭😭😭😭
Roman I love chicken I have my own hatching chickens is fun and a lot of work I been spending time building a hole new chicken coop for mine
That end 😳🤫
What happened to flash
Yes you can do anything you want because there’s so much negative things in the world.
Been here 7 years Roman will be here until the end
Tell us what?! What were you going to tell us Roman?! What was it?!
If ya get a goose it will protect the chickens from predators.  I like to dip chick beaks in the water so they drink right away. Chick are delicate till they become pullets.
Nahhh not being funny if you was so so sorry like you always say then you wouldn’t always disappear...
ayyy he changed the intro music
Cora has the most adorable smile ever.
0:36 mama always got a heart attack

roman you could post a 3 second video of you saying the word “pineapple” AND THAT WOULD BRIGHTEN UP MY WHOLE DAY. anything you do is entertaining and I love you so much for that. I’ve been with you for years and every day you have brought me a different kind of happiness that’s I’ll forever be thankful for and you’ve always made me smile uncontrollably. you are the definition of happiness:(🤍
All Your Videos Are Inspiring & Entertaining All The Time! You & Your Family Are Awesome. Love You Guys! Smile More! 💯🔥❤️

Also man come back at your own pace brother. I’m just happy you’re doing well and the family is getting so big and doing so well. I love the raw family blogs.
cora is the cutest. she’s getting so big 🥰🥺
So glad your back been here for 5 years now
This is captioned so wrong when I’m sad I wanna be uplifted I’m glad I clicked on but I wish it was a happy caption so I can escape x
I feel just seeing where roman has come from and all his videos to what has become of his family through all the good times and hard times is inspirational all on it's own just watching the vlogs even if it's just what they are doing for their day is uplifting and soothing I think just watching their day is entertaining because I feel part of the fam! Smile more everyone
We enjoy anything you post. Post as much as you want, what ever you want because we will always like watching your videos
Brit should film. We want Brit vlogs.
We love you guys!!! I would just love to see the laid back family vlogs. They don’t have to be entertaining ❤️
I could of sworn Cora was still a baby before quarantine and now after quarantine she’s a full grown toddler 🤨
Where is the doggy
Knox is probably like omg this is the family I was born into?! 😂😂😂
Cora's growing up
❤❤❤
Take your time, we're all here for the journey! always fun to watch and entertaining!

Wassup Roman
We just like “hanging out” with you guys. No pressure with what the videos are about.
I love whatever you post but my favorite are just normal everyday blogs
Love your tropical plant set so pleasant on the eyes
I want to see it all. It doesnt matter what its about. My life is so much better with y'all in it!!!
I'm amazed at how happy a 20 minute video can make me. It felt like 5 minutes max haha
Love you Roman. This was both entertaining and inspiring!! Can’t wait to see the chickens and the rocks. Also one year since the tragic passing of your beloved mother - totally understand how you may be feeling. Love you guys so much
Our area is still in lockdown etc it is so strange to watch videos where the lockdowns and masking are ending.
I think we can all use uplifting. I just love the little glimpses into your life. 💕
I have friends that have chickens they have about 60 chickens half are eggs half are meat
I prefer the everyday just hanging out around the house vlog.
Enjoy your baby chicken

Yes don't need the big show and event and plans just regular stuff
love u roman
I’m so glad this pandemic is over now we’re able to do stuff that we couldn’t do I’m glad Roman is back on YouTube uploading again it makes me so happy because I felt depressed during this pandemic I know I wasn’t the only one experiencing depression from this pandemic thanks for uploading again Roman.
All of these sad thumbnails can only mean one thing, the channel is no longer growing, views are down…if you have to beg people to watch. Kinda of sad, but every YouTuber has his day and then fades away.
I love to see these types of Vlogs
What your doing right now is all we need, we love seeing that your doing good things with your family and your a great dad
brit: yes kids, lets have mote kids!  Roman: 😐😑
👑
I loved it!
@Romam Atwood Vlogs, can I send you a lake superior agot? Its a very rare rock called a Agot that is hard to find and beautiful when rock tumbled
We understand being in a rut it’s okay!! Also the cliffhanger at the end mannnnn 😂❤️ love you guys so much
Recording what you guys just do is good enough for me
I love these kinds of videos! Keep these up please! It's almost like I'm growing up with you! I was so young when I first started watching you and now I'm an adult so my tastes have changed for what I enjoy and ai definitely enjoy these kinds of videos. :)
This is absolutely entertaining
Where is flashhhhhhh
I love it! Your channel is the only channel that I follow that is not homesteading of farm life. So.....this change is perfect! The chickens take dirt baths the help get rid of mites and to cool off. WTG!
I love everything you do Roman. as long as you uploading I’m happy.
It doesn’t matter what your videos are about, they are always entertaining

Anything you post is entertaining, I’ve been watching for years and to see you grow as a person and a family, to see you have fun is entertaining in itself!
Less Entertainment More Inspiration 👍🏽
Dude I want to see you on Impaulsive!!!
I like these vlogs
Roman I’ve been a big fan of you and your family since you sold merch out your basement and seeing Zeus grow and I’ve never thought of you as not entertaining and I personally enjoy these videos a lot because your making them that being said we will watch whatever you post and enjoy it because you made it and posted much love
I love videos like these more then the crazy ones. It’s real, and still exciting honestly!
I have goats and there like dogs and they will follow you around

Chicken shopping is fun
Roman does not want more kids 😂😂😂😂
❤️
i love these day adventure vlogs or just vlogging what your doing for the day!! keep doing them!
We have 7 ladies (chickens)
No matter what the video is it’s always inspirational and entertaining just being able to sit down and watch u and your family is the best part of it
Mama!!!
If Roman hearted this I would cry, I have been watching for 5 years ❤️❤️❤️ I’ll never give up on you guys
You should do some video on riding your horses
I really enjoy these blogs keep it going❤️❤️
I love these kinds of vlogs! Who needs crazy entertainment
Prefer the family, every day vlogs! Love seeing you guys as a family and the kids growing.
We love these raw family vlogs more than anything
I just want videos
I prefer this type of vlog over the "entertaining" ones.  Keep it real
Where is the weekly vlogs you were talking about??
My brother actually sold eggs when he had chickens and he sold a lot and got pretty good money
Focus on whatever YOU want to focus on and what’s best for everyone as well!
I appreciate you and I’m glad your posting you always inspiring roman
I have 31 chickens, 4 turkeys and 8 ducks, we hatched them in incubators
I have over 100 chickens, I have turkeys, geese, rabbits, goats, and pigeons 😂
We miss u guys ❤️
You guys should still be wearing masks especially in stores and if your not double vaccinated your setting a bad example Roman
Who’s come back after 1y🥺🥺
U should post them live for we can see how many hop on the moment he post idk how different it is but it would be cool
More inspiring is the most important
What happened to flash
We had chickens but a fox ate all of them
MUSA😂:HAHAHAHA YOUR SAYING WERE YOU TOO DOING!!!
🛐🛐✝️✝️🙏🏻🙏🏻☺️☺️
This vlog was calming and it was nice don’t worry about entertaining bro. I liked this one.
You need to keep bees
I can't help but feel like you're over making videos. You've made your money, your family is sorted for life, now it's boring to you. That's the vibe I get anyway. To be honest, I don't blame you.
Wats up yall
Roman Atwood is part of my child hood❤️
I have chickens and they are the best thing ever
So much love for this family
Chickens are the best!!!! We have a few as well! Ducks are also awesome! You guys need to get some Pekin ducks! They are so fun to watch 😂
Dam the kids grown so fast
So happy to be apart of the Atwood Army! 🥰
THIS INTRO!!
You are the best 😀
At 9:10 that’s actually how they bathe
We don’t have chickens but my dads dream is to raise chickens again. He raised chickens when he lived in Mexico. ❤️
Loving this type of vlogs
This is entertaining no 🧢
Never fails
What happens to your rc cars and your donkies
Man I love this family 😁

You truly inspire me Roman. I’ve been watching you for years and it’s beautiful to see the family you are growing and taking care of. I hope to be where you are one day with your family 🤍
“Yes kids lets have more kids!”  Roman- *😐*
hi
MUSA😀: WOHOHOHO A BIG CHICKEN!!!

We used to have 60 chickens now we got 20
And a prayer for y’all that if there is anything horrible going on that y’all will get through it
I also have chickens
Gotta get a cow to protect the chickens from the coyotes and foxes like in that movie barnyard
We do raise chickens too
Every time i watch ur new vid my childhood just comes all back to me and I love  it ❤️
9:08 😂
Who else here rn?
Please just keep making these we don’t need anything more
Genuine question, how come you guys are mask free? Here in the UK masks are still mandatory and looking to be for some time...
As much as I respect Roman I think he should be an influence on wearing a mask but I see where his political views are and I’m not sure I can agree with him
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
lucky you in montreal canada we still have to put our mask on in public
You know it’s a good vlog when mawmaw is in it♥️♥️
❤️❤️
We still have to wear masks here in Canada😞
❤️ ❤️ ❤️ S M I L E       M O R E ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
I tried your G fuel flavor and it’s the best
This guy is always saying sorry
It's okay
Not easy to catch are they I have 10 of them myself and they are beautiful little hens you should get some more and they are dust bathing quite  natural
Let’s go No more masks much respect
And I want to say a prayer for Zues and your mom that they live safe in heaven
I have chickens
I’m so glad u put the rainbow there 💙
just bought the sunshine hat!
Sun shine one is the best
Them talking about not having masks while me in Canada having to wear it everyday
Thumbs Up
Wait why don't you guys have to wear mask now???
were is country
Cheap freaking hats for what you charge
Where is flash
Love the video
I also got 6 chicks
MUSA: HAHAHAHA YOUR SCANNING CHICKEN!!!
When the chickens roll in the dirt it is basically there bath.(bath dirt)
thats so good that no one had a mask and that you didnt love u roman and the chickens at9:15 are taking dust baths that gets oil of them and kills mites that are like lice
I think you guys  dont have to entertain. Just roll the camera and do whatever you guys do in the normal life and that’s entertaining to me 🙏

Love you Roman
Hopefully your all having a great day!
Not me knowing exactly where they were when they were getting chicken 😂
You need to post more videos
Can you scan this real quick 🤣
Hey roman I love your vids I've been watching for years (fan from Ireland)
Poor grandma.  I cant believe she broke her arm again
And never forget about God never turn your back to him and keep up the positive vibes and I hope you live your best life ever
If you see this message God bless
The sun is my favourite! So cute
No need to be sorry, we will wait until you find a content style you enjoy
I have chickens
It's so strange to watch that. Here in Germany, every store has a strict masking obligation, but you can shop without a mask
Love you guys smile more ❤️❤️❤️
If you give baby chickens to your chickens one will take them as their babies
Be careful if you see jake paul he will swipe that straight off your head
Real time
Lol Ma ma said sh**
I forgot Roman atwood still existed
i was literally half asleep and saw that roman posted and i have never been so awake
My dad and brother love chickens too 🙂

I love the Family vlogs of you guys being yourselves!!! Don’t worry about out doing yourself.
I hate that you have to feel have you need to apologize for not posting. We know you need breaks & that's okay. Nobody is going to have great mental health all the time & we understand that.
In first 10 seconds i knew its gonna be mistake to wearing earphones 😂  Glad to see you back… 😊
