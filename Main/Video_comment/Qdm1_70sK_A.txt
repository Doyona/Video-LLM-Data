That afro -Latino though
He Properly provides pure vibes
one of his most underrated songs

Why is this still not on spotify
this still isn’t on spotify or apple music

I'm catching a lot of dread in this song. Like his identity as a musician, and his career is based on entertainment in a world where distractions fuel entertainment even though it kinda feels like the world's ending.. "they just want me to sing."
Why isn’t this on Apple Music???!? 😔
need this shit in Spotify

WOW.

When it hits your soul, you know it's different level of music ✨ and like he says 'only heaven knows'
Brent, Santino le Saint and Aaryan Shah should make a colab, it just has to be in this life.
Why is this not on Spotify???.
When Apple Music goin drop dis 🤧😩
If he sang the whole song with his regular voice I wouldn’t mind that either
He should make a album or whatevs called Brent vs the world
Giveon is for the heartbroken, Brent is for the toxic...
brent you stole my girl
https://youtu.be/fG73zjXVEz0

Forget who I am  (Did I?) And how this goes?  (Did I?) Did I forget who I am?  (Did I?) And how this goes? Only heaven knows if you can truly win  In the midst of a world that's gon' end How am I up right now? I'm not, I'm still down Only heaven knows if you can truly win  In the midst of a world that's gon' end How am I up right now? I'm not, I'm still down Niggas dying everyday  But what can I say? They just want me to sing (oh-oh) It's like everyone wants you to think how they think  And do what they say and stay out the way And if you don't wanna they got a problem with ya Did I  Forget who I am? (Oh) And how this goes? (No way, no how) Did I forget who I am?  (Did I) Chasing gold Only heaven knows if you can truly win  In the midst of a world that's gon' end How am I up right now? (Yeah) I'm not, I'm still down (oh, oh) Niggas dying everyday  But what can I say? They just want me to sing It's like everyone wants you to think how they think  And do what they say and stay out the way And if you don't wanna they got a problem with ya "I'm not listening to you, you're crazy" It's so hard to realize Things I put you through It's so hard to real life Bring it back to blue Wall of stars I'll turn to

Shout out to this nigga's producer/engineer.. jesus.
well Mr. Brent Faiyaz when are you going to put this masterpiece on spoti!!!
I was super surprised to see "FEAT. PURR" but idk. All he did was play a snippet from their debut last year. I don't get it.
is that a-a-a- a cig?...
outro hits different this time
love
I know for a fact one of his favorite movies is Nacho libre.
Why isn’t this on Spotify
so mf dreamy im so happy for you !! omg that ending is like the end of an all american movie  living your dreams      'only heaven knows'..💞🖤
HEAR ME OUT !! Brent x Giveon x H.E.R ... song title:  “TOXIC”
Hmu Sometime
the name "Purr" reminded me of Coi Leray Big Prrd
i need an album really soon
Brent babe why isn’t this on Apple Music 🥲
Your not the boss of me Mr.Faiyaz💯
Im back here for 100th time Hi💗
Brent should be known by everyone by now !!!!
My head in the clouds with this joint😌☁️
I think the end of this song and the feature that was chosen speaks volumes, you wouldn't expect this of any typical artist & that's exactly why he did it... I think its more than the music for him; you can tell he's trynna branch away from the traditional RnB artist pipeline... thoughts?
Always with the bangers. Old man fan here. Lol
<3
Why this not on Apple Music 😭

I'm loving this Afro moment 😍✨

I'm still down Only heaven knows if you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end How am I up right now? I'm not. I'm still down 🕴🏻dying everyday. But What can I say? They just want me to sing It's like everyone wants you to think how they think & do what they say & stay out the way And if you don't wanna they got a problem with ya  Did I forget who I am? And how this goes? (No way, now how) Did I forget who I am? Chasing gold?  Only heaven knows if you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end How am I up right now? I'm not. I'm still down 🕴🏻dying everyday. But What can I say? They just want me to sing It's like everyone wants you to think how they think & do what they say & stay out the way And if you don't wanna they got a problem with ya  It's so hard to realize Things I put you through It's so hard to real life Bring it back to blue Wall of stars I'll turn to

Lyrics
It's the beat He hear it in his sleep sometimes Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes Real rhymes not your everyday hologram Even when ribs was touchin' never swallowed the ham He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad It might need salt like your man's bland ballad A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell yous Blues on L juice Snooze, all hell loose Rake it Take it like the good, the bad, the ugly Break it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy Butter softly, leather flossy, fatty juggy Always threw me off when she told me "Daddy funk me" I'm like anywho's Seeds walkin' all out in street with out any shoes I guess it's better than some funky socks You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox Instead she wanna hear the beatbox Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock Sing it Bring it, back to your laboratory While he's in his oratory Glorious like a horror story The mask is like Jason They told the place not to let the basket type case in He could be some kind of wacko Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho He busted in Blessed be the Lord Who believe any mess they read up on a message board If so, I got bridges for the low low Same bitch'll a go dry snitchin' to the popo Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear It was the shit when I first scooped it At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid Plead the fifth Sip wine stiffly Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy Gift for the grind Criminal mind shifty Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty Well edjumacated He heard it when he meditated in deep theta Let her hate the creep later Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data Stay he stay self medicated to sleep later Side effects is similar to sugar pill Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger eww And made his exit on some calm shit Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit  Source: LyricFind  Songwriters: Daniel Dumile Thompson  Vomitspit lyrics © Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd.  @dekagotgramz

Have this on repeat because of the deep lyrics 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lyrics.   Forget who I am (did I?) And how this goes? (did I?) Did I forget who I am? (did I?) And how this goes?  Only heaven knows If you can truly win in the midst of a world that’s gon’ end How am I up right now? I’m not, I’m still down Only heaven knows If you can truly win in the midst of a world that’s gon’ end How am I up right now? I’m not, I’m still down Niggas dying everyday, but what can I say? They just want me to sing It’s like everyone wants you to think how they think And do what they say and stay out the way And if you don’t wanna they got a problem with you  Did I forget who I am? And how this goes? (No way, now how) Did I forget who I am? (Chasing gold?)  Only heaven knows If you can truly win in the midst of a world that’s gon’ end How am I up right now? I’m not, I’m still down Niggas dying everyday, but what can I say? They just want me to sing It’s like everyone wants you to think how they think And do what they say and stay out the way And if you don’t wanna they got a problem with you  It’s so hard to realize Things I put you through It’s so hard to real life Bring it back to blue Wall of stars I’ll turn to

He got Michael Jackson stardom on him if he plays it, I can tell he’s influenced by many sounds but this one hits close, I could hear a young Michael on this

🔥
dropbox link is broken :/

The afro tells it all😍😍
🔥🔥🔥
did anyone save those 3 extra songs in the drop box???
More deep voice Shit🤦‍♂️
Did I?
League him.... this man finna be a star
before a mil omg
he never misses 🐐
Not to get specific or in depth with this song, but I feel like his mind is running in “CIRCLES” Specifcally what he’s saying in his lyrics to be exact is what he keeps thinking about & it constantly just ends up back to where the thought started. Which makes it go in circles. Not to mention the video recorder is going in “Circles” around him. Brent is visionary if you ask me.
Ewwww he was saying some real shittt gave out some shit, if you watching high you got allat but fr watch it back if you didn't get it
This is about leaving his past & old life for a better life but by doing so he also question himself if he’s “being a sellout” & says eff it.
Seeing him get so much success makes me happy! Get that coin Bret!!
WOW WOW WOW !!!!! So good!!!!
1.25 speed  is hella dope too ngl
0:23- 0:32 hits different... idk how to explain it
I love his music but I’ll never be anyone’s FAN!!! Be REAL YOU NEVER grew up with him. You connect only through music because you feel you relate. You NEVER KNEW the artist personally. We only can admire there sound but they will always be normal people that make music. Stay woke YALLL. 🔥 🔥 🔥
I’m EXCITEDD
this shits a madterpiece
whats this sample tho, dun heard this somewhere maybe?  mac freestyle maybe?
he biting off TheRealKillamm
Some nice smooth tracks firing out from Brent lately.
Ughhh this episode is everything 😍😍😍
I pray that whoever reads this, GOD HEALS WHATEVER IS HURTING YOU.🙏🏽
ily 💗
DROP WISH YOU WELL

Welcome to the Afro gang
https://youtu.be/XFFrGPaeuVg
Yoooo Brent, this is soooo good, everything bro, keep going, the best is  yet to come
My hubby is getting better every day
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Brent Faiyaz. The melody is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of modern techniques most of the songs will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Brent's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these songs, to realise that they're not just vibin' - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Brent Faiyaz truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Brent Faiyaz's genius unfolds itself on their smartphone screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
Protect this mans at all costs!
It’s everything for me the cinematography, his fro, the vocals just everything ✨
High key want a Brent And Giveon collab 😭😭😭
Okay purrr another banger
MY HUSBAND IS ON THE 32 TRENDING 😝😝👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨

song is incredible but that hair makes him look mad goofy ngl.
Romans 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
WE LOVE YOU ZHAMAK😻

Very single song makes me have goosebumps
He gives me life his music feeds not only my soul but my third eye I love it here 😩😩😩
this sound is heaven on earth
Why this not on Spotify 😫
😭💜💜☮️make it Out
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.

That fro is just too fresh 😂👌
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times! Are you saved from eternal damnation and God's Wrath by believing in the Blood Atonement of Jesus Christ for your sins? All mankind has broken God's Morale Law (this is sinning) and fallen short of God's Perfect Standard and the payment given for sinning is eternal prison, but God loves us so much He provided a way to save us sinners: it's not about not sinning and being a "good" person (we should after we're saved because we're thankful and our fellowship with God and Christ grow stronger and we build heavenly treasures). It's about believing in your heart that Jesus lived a sinless life, died an innocent death and raised up proving who He is and that is God in human form and He did that to cleanse us from ALL of our sins. If you believe Jesus did that for all of us, you will be given God's Gift of Eternal Life. Jesus did everything for us and nailed our sins to the cross. God wants to give you Salvation from damnation, all you have to do is believe in your heart and have faith in what Jesus has done for us.  (KJV)1 Corinthians 15:1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the Gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures: (KJV)Ephesians 2:8-9 For by Grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the Gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.  Gospel of Salvation by Faith Alone https://youtu.be/H124iZiyGUs  Saved by Grace thru Faith 1 minute vid https://youtu.be/1wMldFej-nQ  End Time's Checklist https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI  Satan's Technology (Mark of the Beast) https://youtu.be/4IyPCGKFa0k  Escape Satan's Rule and God's Wrath https://youtu.be/URzo9_eOa00
Hope he don’t change like The Weeknd did

How this not at 1 mil yet
This song make me have 2am thoughts in the middle of the day
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.

Lyrics :  Forget who I am (did I?) And how this goes? (did I?) Did I forget who I am? (did I?) And how this goes?   Only heaven knows If you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end How am I up right now? I'm not, I'm still down Only heaven knows If you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end How am I up right now? I'm not, I'm still down Niggas dying everyday, but what can I say? They just want me to sing It's like everyone wants you to think how they think And do what they say and stay out the way And if you don't wanna they got a problem with you    Did I forget who I am? And how this goes? (No way, now how) Did I forget who I am? (Chasing gold?)  [Verse] Only heaven knows If you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end How am I up right now? I'm not, I'm still down Niggas dying everyday, but what can I say? They just want me to sing It's like everyone wants you to think how they think And do what they say and stay out the way And if you don't wanna they got a problem with you   It’s so hard to realize Things I put you through It’s so hard to real life Bring it back to blue Wall of stars I'll turn to

Blessed 🙏
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen

Brent said what he said in this song in an interview. “You want me to think outside the box within a box??” What the fuck does that mean? Everyone wants you to be different as long as it doesn’t make them feel some typa way
felt it when he said "how am i up right now? im not, im down"
Why he light up that cigarette like it was a blunt 😩😂
He just. DOESNT miss.

They just want me to sing It's like everyone wants you to think how they think And do what they say and stay out the way And if you don't wanna they got a problem with you  [Chorus] Did I forget who I am? And how this goes? (No way, now how) Did I forget who I am? (Chasing gold?)  [Verse] Only heaven knows If you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end How am I up right now?

(Did I?) And how this goes?  Only heaven knows....  if you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end.   How am I up right now? I'm not. Still down. Only heaven knows.... if you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end.   How am I up right now? I'm not. I'm still down.   Niggas dyin' everyday, but what can I say? They just want me to sing. It’s like everyone wants you to think how they think, And do what they say, and stay out the way. And if you don't wanna, they got a problem... with you.    Did I... forget... who I am? And how this goes? (No way, now how?) Did I forget who I am? Chasing gold?    Only heaven knows, if you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end.   How am I up right now? I'm not. I'm still down.   Niggas dyin' everyday, but what can I say? They just want me to sing. It’s like everyone wants you to think how they think, And do what they say, and stay out the way. And if you don't wanna, they got a problem... with ya.     I'm not listening to you, you're crazy!    It's so hard to realize... things I put you to. It's so... hard to real life, Bring it back to blue. Ohhhh, the stars.. are doomed, too.
