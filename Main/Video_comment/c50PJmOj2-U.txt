Cheating speaks for itself
Their expressions at 5:24 lmaoooo
Like a boss
Two of them always are, a master and an apprentice.
She got him half way of the interview. She asked him direct questions at first to throw him off then asked her real questions half way through 😅😛
I'm an industrial designer and I believe the solution to the cheating problem in chess lies in the chairs the players sit on. If equipped with vibration sensors, and also sensors for muscle contractions in the seated part, they would eliminate the most likely means of communication with a device hidden on or in the body. As swollen devices probably are equipped with a pressure sensor, allowing them to be controlled by flexing the stomach muscles (thus increasing the abdominal pressure), a belt may also be part of the solution I think.
A way to finish with all about the cheating scandal is to invite Hans to an on the board tournament against top level players, or even with Carlsen, in a cheating proof place: an airport's duty free area, after all the scanning process and devices available in that kind of place. Moreover, make a delay on the diffusion. Let's then see how his game and correlation factor evolve in this environment
There are options that nobody has taken into account. But everyone - and I mean everyone - is far from valuing them. 😉 BEWARE, YOU CAN'T FIND WHAT YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR! 😉 Mr. Niemann knows this. Mr. Magnus senses it, but he has no way to prove it. I DO! 😃 😉
Hay opciones que nadie a tenido en cuenta. Pero todo el mundo -y digo, todo el mundo- están lejos de valorarlas. 😉 ¡OJO, NO SE PUEDE ENCONTRAR LO QUE NO SE BUSCA! 😉 El Sr. Niemann lo sabe. El Sr. Magnus lo intuye, pero no tiene forma de demostrarlo. ¡YO SI! 😃 😉
I think if someone has been a confirmed cheater, in competitions they should only be able play in competitions if blind to the world (no commentary and no live stream video) until game has ended.
@Magnus Carlsen I think Niemann has someone on another area controlling his mouse when Niemann plays. maybe niemann has a device for it, but it maybe isn't nedded one to cheat in his case..
So many missed questions: will you resign if you meet in the final? Do you feel you cannot win against Hans? How is it possible to cheat over the board in today’s secure matches, should a player that cheated online in the past be allowed to play over the board tournaments… on and on
Magnus is ruining a fellow chess player’s life for childhood sins, pretty unforgivable
Good job dodging bullets
Half a million views in 2 days!
I was a fan of Magnus, but this refusal to talk seems childish. Either prove the cheating or lose like a man.
Stop being a crying baby. Do you know you are the champion of the world and many chess fans even younger ones looking at you as a role model but what you did lately is not acceptable. If you cant handle your attitude then retire early in playing chess. Your disgusting in chess community. Even if you are the champion of the world someone or everyone can beat you. Stop being a crying baby. retire soon.
He smiled every time  the cheating  question was posed. Innuendo..
I love the fact that the tag of this video is League of Legends
"Stockfish level 8 moves fed to me through my tiny earpeice spoke for itself" --Hans Niemann😄😄
Some say that this is the biggest cheating scandal, but since there is not proof of cheating yet, this should instead be called the biggest temper tantrum scandal.
Innocent until proven guilty
Okay I am not getting why anyone is not opening up what's going on behind the scenes. 😀
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

I dont think hans is cheating
**MY HERO!!! IF SOMEONE CHEATS ME, I DON'T THINK I'D REMAIN AS CALM!!!**
This is that arc, when your main character is pretty OP already, but then he has to defeat the AI, to defend his title.
She was so brave
Magnus - G.O.A.T - greatest of all time. Hans - C.O.A.T - cheater of all time.
Apparently Magnus Carlsen is a League of Legend pro player according to youtube
All I can say about the putative mechanism of cheating is to quote mr slave…. Jeez Christ. Oooooo.
noone cares about chess, everyone cares about drama hahah..and hot chicks interviewing
Magnus Carlsen es un señor entre señores.
excellent interview
Games: Leagues of legends
The interviewer went for the smart Magnuswillfinallyspeak gambit but sadly Mangus didn't fall for it, so it ended in a draw.
My real question is WHY is game marked in the description is league
Some people are just cowards They are waiting the others to talk about them
League of Legends?!
What is his opinion on anal bead cheating? Is it legit?
Disgusting behavior by "champion", you got owned, get over it. I bet he enjoys using his status to try to break prodigy's career.
By the way, here's an interesting vid explaining the background of the name-drop in Magnus' statement (Maxim Dlugy) that is very interesting in light of recent context: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVTaWOADbBE&list=PLqSUiaxvBBkjBgtzIlbNP4AntDTX9BnFv&index=3
Hans fishes for itself
Keren saya sangat suka tetap sukses selalu....
Magnus is such a troll 😂
Hans Niemann is the perfect storm. He'll be the first grand master to reach 2900. He's on a level that none of the other top grand masters can even comprehend his superior analysis. His instinct is so strong, that calculation is merely a waste of his time. What a complement it is for someone to (indirectly) accuse you of cheating, merely because you've unleashed your raw talent upon them.
You can't punish people because you suspect them of cheating. Be a great champion by trying your best no matter what and history will show who cheated and who didn't. You're in a very privileged position in life, act like it. Remember Lance Armstrong? It never influenced the achievements of the honest riders.
she missed an opportunity to ask about the anal beads theory
What bs to say you can’t talk about something knowing full well that will imply you suspect foul play.
Magnus please put the MS Teams Minecraft background on your next interview
Am I the only one wondering why Magnus has linked League of Legends in this video's discription?
Over 300 U.S. Diplomats can no longer work.
Why is this under league of legends? I was watching chessbrah react to this and just noticed it :D
Possibly Hans Moke can be stripped fully naked without finding anything, thinking we are donkeys. The manipulation in chess has something of magic. People watch trickery, but they do not understand the hidden transmission of the best or second-best moves. Grandmaster Niemann is a great magician in his performances, and in his opinion, an innocent lamb subjected to a witch hunt.   Examining the history of Chess Cheaters so far, it is noticeable that they have no guilty conscience at all. They feel innocent and just keep on cheating when they can. As an example serves the blind Norwegian Tholo Bjørnsen, who lied his head off. For strong players, it's a huge burden when they know full well that their opponent is using the computer to help them, but the evidence is hard to come by. That makes the withdrawal of world champion Magnus Carlsen more understandable. Other players have climbed onto a toilet seat and looked over the partition. There are even videos of this. GM Igors Rausis analyzed on his smartphone without really doing any business, and Patrycja Waszczuk of Poland was similarly convicted and banned. Borislav Ivanov of Bulgaria refused to take off his giant shoes and was disqualified. The cheating didn't stink to high heaven because of his unwashed socks. Anal beads with morse signals would indeed be even harder to prove. Still their are a lot of other possibilities. The parents of Hans Niemann (Niemand means in German nobody) are IT experts. His mentor and trainer Maxim Dlugy cheated 2017 online and was also banned (Magnus Carlsen mentioned him yesterday in an interview!).  The more time passes, the more circumstantial evidence is found that Hans Niemann very probably cheated in normal chess as well. I already found it striking that Hans Moke didn't win any game after the time-delayed broadcast in St. Louis. On the You-Tube channel of the Ukrainian FM Andrii Punin with name Chess Fan MWP it is shown that Niemann played the first recommendations of older computer programs like Rybka and Stockfish 11. IM Atle Grønn commented in the newspaper Dagbladet: In normal games the US-American mostly played according to his ranking, but in especially important games Niemann played almost unbelievably precise and above his conditions. In some of the games he analyzed, Niemann played rows and rows of computer moves at a time (third GM norm) and didn't allow himself a mistake. That's hard to believe - especially since these were important games in which the pressure on the youngster was particularly high.   Magnus Carlsen simply gives up after the first move in the Julius Baer Generations Cup, going offline and pouring more fuel on the fire. This isn't a witch hunt, though, but a strong statement against a cheater with a big mouth. The World Champion, like his Norwegian compatriot, is sure that from a chess perspective it's not possible to play like that and the probability of it happening is close to zero, even if many chess fans believe in the good in two-time cheater Hans Moke Niemann.
Artificial Intelligence needs human bots!!!
Good interview tho... She did a good job fishing xd
You are a bully not a champion You should be ashamed of yourself
I know he's getting bombarded with these same questions over and over, but this is really unprofessional on the part of Magnus. Frankly, so was the drama around the world championship but that's a different story. If you know or suspect cheating, set the wheels in motion with the people who have the power to make something happen and then STFU. If the evidence comes out that Hans is cheating, ban him. Until then, let the process work itself. Say "no comment" and mean it.
Imagine using stockfish and still can't win the tournament after given free points from a world champion.. lol.. <3 Carlsen
Kaja's interview rating is 2900+ I believe...
Should've asked if he will resign again if he meets Hans in knockouts :D
So under games category Magnus placed this video under League of Legends…..the plot just continues to thicken.
If performing far above your rating is not proof of cheating, then withdrawing and resigning aren't proof of an accusation of cheating. If they can't claim Niemann is cheating, then they also can't claim that Carlson has accused him of it. "Unprecedented" does not mean "against the rules." It's funny how I see so many articles mentioning that Niemann admitted cheating "when he was younger". He's 19. In other words, he has admitted cheating in the very recent past. Like, since I started my current job. It's ironically like that Norwegian Eurovision song where he says, "Years ago, when I was younger, I kinda liked this girl I knew..." What do you mean when you were younger? You ARE younger.
"I have to say I am very impressed by Niemann's play and I think his mentor Maxim Dlugy (who cheated) must have been doing a great job" - haha love the comment.
Ninguém é culpado, até que se prove o contrario. O que sabemos é que o Magnus fugiu de medo.
Magnus providing League of Legends montage, didnt expect that
I guess this is an application of the Kaja "Snare".
Magnus the GOAT
magnus, are you cheating?
People defending Hans Niemann remind me of Lance Armstrong fanboys: "How could you accuse him of cheating without evidences ?" We had to wait for years (and the help of the FBI) to get evidences of something that was pretty obvious to everyone who was unbiased.
Good luck and shake them down for the truth
This League of Legends scandal is really something.
Magnus come on brother. People love you and taht is gonna change if you keep doing this. Interviewer is very good though.
He sounds depressed
When Hans plays non-standard brilliant moves he is a cheater. When Magnus plays non-standard brilliant moves he is a king of chess. The current official fact is Magnus lost recent games to Hans, with poor performance in the game that started the drama, and displayed very unprofessional behavior since then. Glad he recovered from the loss. Until proven otherwise no time for mumbo jumbo an hide&seek by Magnus. Will respect serious position and explanation hopefully to come but this interview is rather disappointing.
Hidden answers, which chess players would understand.
Magnus Carlsen, the biggest clown in chess history.
I used to admire this little brat... His level is going down. His moves are not as good as before. That's the truth.
I do not understand how people impressed from the interviewer. She was like crying to get an answer. 'please magnus tell me something'.  Basically she asked the questions in a dumbest way.
Respect for Magnus for giving this interview.
It should be simple. You cheat and you are banned for 20 years. Period!
BTW this Maxim Dugly who's supposed to be Niemann's mentor was caught cheating in a titled tuesday. Magnus doesn't shoot without a bullet 😏
Carlsen thinking about the lawyers here. Clearly he would say a lot more if it didn't get him in legal trouble.
No-one cares about a quitter! He should be banned from chess!!
League of Legends? That is how you gain money on Youtube
an interview like a chess game.  very nice ;)
Imagine Magnus is actually cheating as Hans Niemann is suspected to, just to prove to the world that it happened. Could be a fiction.
Magnus speaks for itself
If Magnus were to meet Nieman in the quaters, he wouldn’t have accepted this interview though.
Magnus "little baby" Carlson  It's sad that someone who is scared to speak and disrespecting fans and other players without any proof call him self a champion. In sport Champions have a code that doesn't let them to do such a silly things. Champions don't give games by wallk over. Grand Master who acting like a kid in prime school and loosing his game to a PC should be called a Grand Fool.  There is a hudge group of people like lawyers,doctors, that can impact life of other people. They have responsible jobs  and know that empty accusations are unacceptable in a modern society. Only group that doesn't seem to understand is a close group of grown men's that trying to beat PC in a game with pieces.
Magnus Carlsen on cheating on chess: "Don't recommend it"
Hans is guilty as hell He is using beads
I don't mind Magnus putting a spotlight on cheating in chess, but I do think the way he is going about it is wrong.
She is...
Never a magnus fan before but recently I found myself as his big fan. Even with all this drama, I think no one else can bring this up except magnus.. All the best magnus.
What's the name of the commentator?
The interviewer and commentators at chess24 work for magnus. He’s their employer. So it’s like Magnus interviewing Magnus
stop playing chess even in the interview....very impressive interview...
Kaja = beast
So no anal beads talk? I mean... that is what we are all wanting to hear about right?
Who is here from gothamchess?
Sour loser magnus.
Veit ikke hva du veit, så er ikke lett å gi råd, men viss du er veldig sikker så ville jeg fortsatt spilt finalen. om det er niemann
Magnus didn’t fall for anything! You don’t realize, that the question is just as important as the answer. You can copy the same answer as responses to different questions and only sometimes be in legal troubles.  He made the Interviewer ask vague questions, and only then gave his speech. Doesn’t matter how subtle Magnus speaks, if it’s an answer to a very direct (defamatory/accusative) question.
Viss det blir deg og hans i finalen så please spill uansett, uansett om det er fishy eller ikke så er det bedre å spille. så får vi se med tiden hva det blir til, jeg vet ikke hva jeg skal tenke, men ikke la deg tilte av det, spill så godt du kan som om han er legit, og viss han fotrsetter å knuse folk da så ser det bare mer fishy ut.
Never heard anyone say "ummmm" so much.
very cool intervieuw I enjoyed every second of it.
Why does it say the *LAST* tournament in the video title? Is it just a way of saying it is the "latest" or "most recent" tournament he has played, or is something more being hinted at?
Whatever happens Magnus is the besttttt
Magnus should start mentoring three Praggu, Arjun and Keymer
The cheating part reminded me of the sessions with my therapist. She being my therapist and me being Magnus.
The video blurring option does a good job showing us the place is in total order.
magnus better produce something significant or he is a disgrace imo
I feel you bro, so bored of this stupid question all over again...
This is not fair behavior, Magnus. Even if not spoken out explicitly, you are accusing your opponent. And the whole chess world is taking it up. You should never accuse somebody, if you do not show evidence. And in case there IS proof, you must show it right away and not only AFTER the tournament. Very bad behavior, Magnus.
What she should have asked him, or what she should ask him next time, is: _"Besides the current measures already being taken at OTB events, what additional measures would you like to see implemented?"_  ... Because think about it...A cheater does not even have to use an electronic device on their person to cheat. They could simply receive signals from someone in the same room, or within visual range, (e.g. glasses on/off) and that would be enough for them to know that they have a winning move in the current position or that their opponent has made a mistake.
Such a great interview
Nice to know that Magnus Carlsen is playing League of Legends.
nice league of legends gameplay Magnus! I’m a big fan of moba game
Magnus never accused anyone of anything. He was only hinting, but Hans supporters knew that Magnus was hinting that Hans was cheating, as Hans failed to explain why he was feeding Magnus his pieces, which This suggests that Hans was cheating even among Hans' supporters. Only regret that from now on, when cheating technology is more and more developed, chess will no longer keep its inherent purity. Perhaps in the future we will have to say goodbye to this sport forever.
YouTube thinks its League of Legends? xD
He speaks somehow different from other interviews. For me this is a proof Magnus is uncomfortable with the situation. Great interview!
Maybe Magnus actually lost to Hans in the Sinquefield Cup and is now acting like a crybaby NBA basketball player. Grow up (or provide evidence) crybaby.
i’m more imperessed with the thumbnail.
Personally Magnus' Love for the game of chess is his cause, and having that love offended once upon a time is his statement, is my conclusion.
Jeez Magnus, what you scared of?
what if magnus is cheating in this tournament just to prove a point of how easy it is
It seems Magnus lost a bet playing poker and the winner asked for you know what :)
This recent debacle feels like chess crossed with WWF, but I believe in Magnus.
For such a genius this moron sure says "uhmmmmmmm" allot
This is hilarious
*Magnus may be the best chess player ever but seriously, he doesn't have the highest class outside the sports.*
Funny that everyone thinking Hans can reach the finals lol
Life: Choose Public speach or death. Magnus: Hold my Zagreb.
Go and see the video with IM Ken Regan. He’s the expert on chess cheating. The professor analyses Hans’ games and found no evidence of cheating… what evidence do you have?
Touch tips and get it over with
Imperessed
Nicely Framed questions, and nicely defended by Magnus. My interpretation:  Magnus  clear indication is towards cheating.
Since he is not denying it, we can be sure that he is convinced that Hans is cheating. Since he is talking about the current performance, I suspect that he believes that Hans is cheating in the current tournaments, not just in the past.
good interviewer
I think Levon is going to put up a fight.
Queen dying: i sleep Russia mobilizing: i sleep Magnus interview on Hans: 👁️👁️
Class Act.
So we can buy Sweden if we want… thank you for the analysis Magnus.
Chad experienced host
So who was it on your team that leaked your prep to Hans?
Magnus gonna sue Hans ( Anal beads ) Newman and his coach
Magnus is an absolute legend. Good interview, but Magnus is very clear. He will  come with a statement later on. G.O.A.T..
Shri Magnus carlson Do you wanna know why from this I'd I'm telling you to introduce one more piece to the chess.... Because chess is a game of deception It doesn't matter how hard you try you won't be able to defeat stock fish level 8 as human capacity have it's limit... I Love Norway First country in the world to have all electric cars that too tesla... People are in india gets offended if I speak about that.... Pragnandha is nothing compared to you.. Just a 13yr old god gifted talent.... Introduce a piece and let's see how they will fall... Same with tic tac toe  You can never defeat me in tic tic toe with your 3000 iq you wanna know why because I know the trick...... Love from New Delhi -K.N (Nishkarm Yogi)
This is insane leauge of legends gameplay 😅
How interesting 🤣🤣
Magnus speaks for himself.
This dialogue is like a masterpiece by itself.
Magnus carlsen one of the greatest player of league of legends
lol what a child
Magnus said *Cheaters should not be taken lightly, um online or um OTB* I been saying it on numerous channel in the comments.. Magnus won’t play Hans because he thinks Hans should be banned from the sport.. not a popular opinion but with what Magnus said here it speaks to my opinion being correct..
I don't get why Magnus doesn't just openly say what he thinks. I guess he doesn't want to actually say it since he doesn't have solid evidence.
I love the awkwardness in this interview
It's funny that she's interviewing him on the ethics of a person hiding something on the body, and using it to receive instructions from one's manager. And of course, she's doing it with instructions on what questions to ask from the producer in her ear.
I guess Magnus's chess speaks for itself.
Every answer is in magnus sytle...he said many things without actually saying anything thing.,as expected from the magnus...
Magnus, your play was well above your normal results........perhaps all your opponents should refuse to play you in the future.
Sorry Magnus but you missed a realy good moves in the interview.  Why you resigned?  Meme speak for itself.
Check out this body language analysis video of Hans' interviews, by Derek Van Schaik.
On another time I might not have suspected Niemann at all and given him the benefit of the doubt, but this was before the Lance Armstrong scandal happened.   Folks, let's not forget about Lance.  For years he denied cheating, and he even went as far as suing those who accused him of cheating.  Plus most people could not fathom how he could be cheating in the first place and thus also gave him the benefit of the doubt.  But the rest is history.  He WAS cheating majorly and had one of the most elaborate cheating schemes ever conceived for the sport of cycling.  If there is a suspicion that Niemann has found a way to cheat, it must be investigated fully.  Whenever fame and money are involved, ways of cheating will be found, especially as out technology evolves faster and faster.  Cheating must be taken seriously in any competitive event where money and fame are involved.  Finally, Magnus does not strike me as the kind of person that would maliciously defame someone who defeated him.  Worst case, he is mistaken about his suspicions and would have to issue an apology, but Magnus is an intelligent person, so there is a good chance his suspicion is valid, even if it is hard to prove at this point.  If cheating is taken more seriously in chess, and Niemann is guilty of cheating, he won't be able to sustain his cheating scheme for long.
I mean no malice so please can someone explain why he can’t outright say he does suspect cheating occurred?
something's telling me hans does not have the funds to spend on frivolous litigation based on talk around chess cheating. so i don't quite get in the slightest what all this BS hush hush kafuffle is about
Magnus: I will not comment on that  Everyone but Magnus: Oh but I will!
All he has to say is, "My opinion is that the guy cheated, but I have no evidence. You all can draw your own conclusions, but this is my opinion and I'm fully entitled to publicly state it as an opinion. I fully welcome anyone to prove my opinion to be incorrect."  But, I'm writing this from the United States, where I know it is not illegal to state an unsubstantiated opinion. I do not know the laws in other countries. I believe some Middle Eastern countries have laws forbidding insulting people and gossiping. Not sure about Norway or anywhere else.
I do cheat sometimes... against Nelson.
Yo I wonder what Magnus has planned if he is willing to talk more about it AFTER the tournament.  Just think about it...the way things are set up now in the tournament, if Magnus and Hans were to face off again, it will be in the FINAL ROUND, for the championship. Can you imagine, if of course the cheating allegations are true, that Magnus has some intricate plan to expose Hans cheating in the act, with irrefutable evidence that the whole world can see? And to pull that off in the FINAL ROUND?  If this were a chess anime, we would definitely be nearing the climax of the "Chess Speaks for Itself" arc ♟️😆
Cry baby
I'm happy to see chess becoming much more mainstream.
Magnus you’re the greatest, whether he’s a cheater or not.
Yeah great job by the interviewer 👏
U missed most important question : If Magnus and niemann reached finale, then do we see 1.5 moves or full game ??? 🤔🤔🤔
The interviewer was overly aggressive. Quit asking the same type of question 5 times in a row when the first respone was "I'll answer a bit more about that subject at the end of the tournament."
Jesus this interviewer could not have done any worse... Someone obviously fed her the question at ~4:15... hard to watch. She needs to work on how to word questions.
Very impressed by the cheating methods
"Games: League of Legends"
good eye contact
is this league of legends?
This all could be solved by allowing chess engines to compete in tournaments. Of course it would mean the human players would not be champion again, and maybe even lose every time, but at least we would have a tournament between the actual best chess "players" and a crowned best chess AI :) When you are working in a system that by definition is closed and its lowest factors are both limited and fully known, you are really stressing it with only having humans when even cheap (or possibly free) chess AI would obliterate them. Just imo.
Good interview very classy
Hens mentor has magnus pregame plan leaked from magnus team .magnus knows that only .
I mean considering Magnus's mumbling against increasing anti cheating measuring steps, anal bead theory doesn't seem impossible, maybe hans broke Magnus's supergenius cheating methods.
I feel like your lawyers don't approve of this video. lol
So, he got no explaining for acting like a douche and leaving Sinqfield Cup. I hope he continues with the most excelent chess he's around these days, and stop being so Fischer-esk in the mad departament.
mf too good at chess start playing real life chess
Im a drama queen at this point .. I want to knooow!
5:50 i'm not sure why he's not commenting on a more general level here. he's acting like he has 50 civil lawsuits against him or some BS
Love u Magnus
50 hints in this whole interview. I'm 80% sure magnus thinks hans is cheating.
Magnus sounds like just a sore loser .. .put up or shut up , be a man...  Magnus just blundered the Hans game away, maybe he was sick or something who knows.
Magnus Carlsen needs a heavy dose of self-criticism. He definitely should apologize (and Hikaru should as well) to Hans Niemann for having caused and allowed a scandal related to totally unproven cheating that may seriously damage the career of a rising star in the chess world. The presumption of innocence until PROVEN guilty is obviously not a principle followed in the chess world. The real scandal  has to do with those who accused Hans, presumed his guilt with zero evidence, and have unnecessarily brought about the humiliation of professional chess before the entire world, and have done no favors whatsoever to the expansion of the game of chess within the broader public. This is now breaking news, but in the long run it may be devastating for competitive chess. It remains to be seen how this will play out.
That laugh @0:05
good job Kaja
Interesting that he mentions Hans' coach. Didn't Hans not want to name his coach in his interview during the Sinquefield cup?
The answer lies in the things he cannot say. Magnus has given us a rough outline of the things he cannot say.
"I think I'll just let the unsubstantiated innuendo speak for itself." "Niemann is pretty good at chess by the way."  "By the way, unsubstantiated innuendo speaks for itself." "That's why it's called unsubstantiated innuendo." "That's all I have to have to say on the subject, by the way." "After the tournament, maybe I'll say more of the same, more or less."
"Unwilling to speak" means "I won't admit I'm wrong", because at this point you've got to produce the evidence.  If it's "I don't know the technology but I am almost sure he's cheating because x y and z" then you have to put x y and z out on the table.  Just throwing mud without substantiation just reflects on Magnus.  If Dlugy is helping Niemann during the game, you've got to say how he might be accomplishing that.  "I think it's very easy to cheat" HOW??  Cheating of course is taken seriously, and you refused to identify any additional measures you would suggest.    I know Dlugy is hated, but also feared, and whatever he does is legal unless it involves help during the game.  At one time you were playing well for your rating too.  It seems maybe Niemann is breaking a sort of "cartel" to freeze out Dlugh.
If Carlsen says something negative and comes out to be untrue, he'd be liable for defamation. Most of us aren't worth few pennies,  thus,  we can say whatever we want without much consequences. But, Carlsen is worth millions.
Legend 🙌
Lol
looks like he's reading from a script lol. such a weird situation to continue like this, it really does seem like a concerted effort to push out a specific GM from chess because they have cheated online (OTB being unfeasable really to be honest). which is strange since magnus has played top GMs who have also cheated online to my understanding. possibly here, maybe the last straw was broken for him in some respect and he decided to take a hardline approach and use his influence to make an example out of hans. with magnus alleged having seen that chesscom list of top 100 players who have cheated online, combined with the embarrassing hans loss, it seems most likely to be a combination of him taking a hard stance now and some resentment towards hans
Great job interviewer👍
Do you cry at night because you lost to Hans?
Why can't we see replies to comments anymore
did he just leak Hans' coach here?
Magnus is a sore loser that is facts at the moment
There was a rumor that Magnus will be going to Iceland and apply for citizenship. He is also trying to rent Bobby Fischer's last place of residence. In his luggage , it is reported that he has several types of anal beads in order to conduct experiments on how one can cheat at chess with this unique device.
hans owns u 💀
Huh creating chees drama and making video about it. Stonks
Urghhhh Apple.
I’m not saying that magnus is correct in how he is handling this or that he is right about Hans cheating. However, if Magnus really was a salty cry baby about losing to hans and therefore decided to say he was cheating…. He would say that about every player he has ever lost against but he doesn’t. Magnus gives other players their flowers. He praises Alireza, he praises Pragg, he gives people their flowers.
Shout out to hans coach
Its wild this video has so little views
Luke Skywalker challenging the sith lords
Storm in a teacup really. No clarification on how you can cheat in a board game when you are playing face to face and when players have been frisked before for electronic devices. On a side note, any publicity is good publicity like they say and mainstream media is buzzing with this story like a much anticipated heavyweight title fight.
I think a lot of things may or may not be going on behind the scenes. In the beginning I thought it was mysterious and in the end I came back to the beginning.
Carlsen is making his own rules. He should withdraw from chess, imo.
I truly love this league of legends content from Magnus
Something big is gona happen. I heard FIDE is getting involved ..Days will tell..
Hey Magnus, Other people beat nimeman Hans then you are not beating ?  I think you need a coach
Prolly mad cause he’s cheating better than Magnus can. 🤷‍♂️
everyone being completely silent about everything is so ridiculous
I feel like if Magnus doesn't come out with some solid evidence against Hans in the next month or so I will be very disappointed in him.
Magnus is impressed with Hans Niemann, yet he withdraws after one move in a game with him.  He does not explain why. Really? He should either state his reasons or play out the game. No reason to destroy another player's reputation by acting like a spoiled child.
Cheating in chess, the fabric of this world has been ripped beyond repair, we faced COVID, floods around the world, nuclear threats....but this here folks, this is it.
Anyone who doesn't know English would think Um is a very important word
LEGEND, LEGEND, LEGEND, LEGEND, LEGEND, LEGEND, LEGEND, LEGEND, LEGEND, LEGEND,
i turned 31 godbless the queen
somebody tell him how many times they hacked against me in my gaming career
How is magnus himself clickbaiting the "cheating" drama?
I think an apology to Hans is in order?
Magnus be back in your best play dont lose anymore.
Dude sounds half asleep and drunk off booze
Alguém tem relatório desta entrevista?
god
Magnus is just playing the chess world as if it was another chess game to him. Using a gambit of his public image in hopes to perhaps get a chance of equalizing or even have a better position than most will suspect.  TRULY a World Chess Champion.
GOAT vs admitted repeat-offending cheater. Hmm I wonder which side is telling the truth
Clever interview and clever answer, by not giving any comments about those crucial questions, seems to Me like Magnus basically confirming about the suspicion of Hans cheating while avoiding any lawsuit about defamation which may put against Him.  Man, it must be so frustrating to have no evidence to proving misdeeds someone has done against you. But if Hans actually not cheating, then that's a very clever and very evil way to ruin someone's career.
Bro is probably held at gunpoint and mfs want him to speak lol
Magnus mad cuz bad.
USA team always cheating on any sports and war also.
"His coach must be doing a great job" ;)
chess speaks for itself
This whole saga only proves that the average Chess player has extremely low IQ and a terrible understanding of the world, because they think Magnus will openly reveal his methodology (i.e. his intellectual property) on how he determined Hans is cheating. You guys need to grow a brain.
wow kaja snare executed that interview masterfully. she asked the cheating-related the questions with just the right amount of confidence, without coming off as pushy or annoying. it made magnus react to the questions with laughter, even though he can't answer any of them openly.
Magnus is cheating to prove Niemann is cheating. Next level move
Not allowed to speak? Not allowed by whom?   Magnus isn't a US citizen and can't be sued by Hans.
You know Magnus got paid bank for this interview.
Clearly Carlsen accuses Niemann because of cheating. But if he does, then he needs evidence. Where is the evidence? Why exactly did Carlsen think that Niemann was/is cheating? And even if Niemand cheated/is cheating, would it be a reason to leave Sinquefield Cup, as long as you don't have the evidence? Hey Magnus, it's not ok to let the people wait after your accusations against Niemann. Show the evidence. Why exactly did you withdraw from Sinquefield Cup after the game vs. Niemann? Why exactly did you resign in the last online game vs. Niemann? You would do yourself a favor to show the evidence NOW and to explain to us NOW exactly why you think Niemann was/is cheating.
What a coward.
Evasive answers.
E p s t e 1 n
League of Legends?
Magnus talking like he drank 5 shots of Nyquil.
He mentioned Hans mentor so this is probably about the mentor and not hans
The "If I speak I'm in big trouble" gif has just gained new meaning, especially for those trigger-happy Internet keyboard warriors
All this adds to the saga is he has (obliquely, but deliberately and by name) tipped Niemann's second into the fire of allegations
Did  I miss or she didn't ask the million $ question: why did you not face Hans and decided to resign?
The interviewer really was well prepared.. She asked all the questions point blank.. no drama or mincing words.. it was like white and black..  she did more than what everyone wanted to know and ask.. good job!
The boss speaks at last
"The score speaks for itself."
#TeamMagnus
Amazing league of legends gameplay, magnus.
i have huge respect for magnus.. since the world championship match against Ian.. he speaks sensibly.. he doesn't rush.. he is not rash.. he looks more humble.. appreciates skill.. and knows exactly what he is doing.. he looks superior mentally.. and looks more balanced emotionally...  They way he conducted this interview was so graceful.. he did not look rattled or emotionally charged.. but played it like chess... huge respect man... cheers!
this is a gaming video - "League of Legends" lmaooo, good job youtube
Wait this was uploaded by Magnus himself? Jesus, the irony
"im very impressed" thats the main line..
draw your own conclusions and then compliment him?? oh cmon. magnus has already shown himself to be the greatest player. he is the michael jordan of chess, but this is particularly unsportsmanlike. just quit chess instead of resigning individual games and turning the public mob on the player!!
People, we gotta analyse this interview. The interviewer did a good job poking Magnus very subtly with each question. Magnus has indeed, again, insinuated a bunch of stuff. For example, no sane person credits one's coach before the player himself. I'm sure there's more stuff in there.
People stop saying that he can't speak because of legal reasons hans may find out!!
Magnus with the top notch sarcasm
Either a coward or a bad person. Coward for no saying what he feels. What's he afraid of, hes the world champion and most players will repeat whatever he says. In case it is not related to cheating hes a bad person for letting hans get all this bad reputation without saying what all this is really about.
This interview IS a chess game
"I will not comment on that," means "Yes." Look, no sane person would think they're in trouble if they simply disown an unintentional and harmful insinuation.
hans will always been known as a cheat and a meme
Magnus clickbaiting himself
I can't believe there's so many commenters who have passed the Bar Exam!
“It’s quite obvious he can’t speak” people saying that need to stfu. Bro puts out a cryptic tweet and doesn’t elaborate causing a whole bunch of accusations when there was no proof. If y’all were in Hans shoes y’all would be crying and wanting to off yourselves. Stfu!!
I got nothing to say #Mourinho
I advise all you pro chess nerds to enjoy the moment & take advantage of the shine this shade is spreading on your 8x8 nerdom as Magnus potentially shifts into a post-1974 Bobby Fischer mode.
Scruffy hair and clean shave, interesting combo
I understand the sarcasm behind your thumbnail 😂 well done Magnus
It's pretty obvious Magnus wanted to go down in history as participant in world's shortest game of chess. That's one for the books.
Missed opportunity to ask about the anal beads 🤣🤣
Bruhhh
Plz magnus, destroy them. Much love
She's a great interviewer!
The guy plays poker.  We all know what's he got in store
Magnus has a great poker face
The vibrating buttplugg speculations, will not die after these statements by MC.
Thanks for posting this up, what a great interview.  Magnus not throwing shade towards Hans just SMASHING the competition on a rampage to a clear victory here.  Love how great he is overall.
Magnus not giving any more chess results on Him vs Hans probably because he wants that very last game they played to still be the relevant data for whatever he is going to say after the tournaments maybe that would explain why he is refusing to play Hans  But this is just me thinking who knows, Magnus saying he will give a statement after the tournaments makes me think he actually has something on Hans.
Everyone defending magnus are clowns 🤡
The interviewer gets white and the interviewee gets black. Magnus defended quite well here. Let's see what he has to say after the tournament.
*Gotta appreciate the interviewer’s persistence!*
Magnus is simply the best ever
Magnus is very good at chess. Magnus is very poor in this interview.
Chances are, he believes Hans cheated based on the way he was playing, but there is no way to prove it with evidence. He has no way to prove anything, so there's no point in sending direct accusations right now.
I am not following chess for that long but i really admire Magnus.  He has a personality of a man who don't give a f.. about anyone's opinion not a people pleasure, he refuse to play on world chess day by saying "not in a mood" 😂 and he do things in his own away and still a world champion 😍 He shattered that image of "nerd chess champion" he gives a vibe of a guy from your group
This has sore loser all over it, feel bad for Hans this blokes having a cry
I've only lost respect for Magnus and his team during this whole saga. While I understand the reasoning behind dropping out before presumably asking the Sinquefield Cup to raise security measures, the reality where Hans Niemann was not found to be cheating shows no clear end. I can only assume their plan was for Hans to crumble under the pressure and admit to cheating, but they didn't get nearly as much as they has hoped. Now it seems Magnus and his team are either taking time to gather evidence or have holed up to avoid legal ramifications.  Was this really the right way to go about things? Was it really worth causing all of this drama, just to be at the point where you're still leaving minor hints two weeks after the drama started?  Maybe Magnus will prove that Hans hacked his Slack to get his opening prep or used Morse code anal beads, but this situation seems poorly handled nonetheless.
For those majoring in Drama: Take Notes.
Gotta love how the interviewer asked one first question about cheating, then moved on to other questions as if that was it, and then came back in force with some incisive questions. Made me feel like it was pretty tactical. Either way it’s good to finally from Magnus on this mess, even if only in passing.
Bobby Carlsen🙂
I feel Magnus is himself fatigued and troubled by all of this...
Well tried!
Did he cheat? Who is cheating? Why is cheating? What is cheating? When is cheating? How is cheating?  [End of interview]
great League of Legends gameplay and interview with rank 1 player Carlos Magnusen
go Magnus! You sacrificed the exchange for a big positional compensation. Now Hans fans are sweating.
Both did a great job here. Probing but respectful questions and Magnus could give diplomats some lessons.
I watched few of Neimann’s recent games and he looks off the screen to the top left of him, takes a glance and then brushes his hair. Many times. Anyone spotting this? Post games and time stamps when it happens if you are noticing this
It’s the anal beads man
I swear Magnus is going to come out as Han's secret chess coach
The fact that Hans is threatening legal action is further proof he is still a cheater.  As Cartman said, "In America it's okay to cheat, as long as you cheat your way to the top."
I don't know whats happening behind the scene but this drama gives chess the spark and exposure it need. Although it's a bit risky if things keeps rolling the other way around.
Magnus is the King of chess, sometimes we need to heed the King’s advice in life and ask no more questions. Maybe this problem cannot ever be fully resolved, but I for one believe in the King and listen to the King as he has led the chess world now for over 10 years.
Did Hans cheat? I don't know how he did it but it's like looking at Jimmy Saville and asking whether he is a pedophile? Hans is not the greatest chess player in the world but his rating will eventually show that he is  😅🤣
Petty to leak Hans' coach who he clearly didn't want to reveal, even while not actually confirming anything else.
WHATTT??? IMPRESSED??? i dont think so....
It's very clear now that Magnus strongly believes Hans cheated. It's also quite likely he doesn't have a smoking gun or he'd have come forth with it (then again we rarely do have smoking guns with chess cheaters, even when they're caught).   People who say he should just play and stop protesting if he doesn't have proof Hans cheated are just being stupid. There's two possibilities here: 1) Hans didn't cheat. Magnus has finally cracked to the great madness of top level chess and is having his Fischer arc. Obviously in this case Magnus is totally in the wrong. 2) Hans did cheat and Magnus' actions so far are completely justified and as much as he can do without inviting lawsuits.  In either case his actions make perfect sense from where he's standing. Magnus isn't a coward for not making direct allegations he can't prove that he could be held liable to, he's just being practical. On the other hand if he believes he got cheated against over the board, why on earth would he want to play in this online tournament against someone caught cheating online during the pandemic?   The only real thing you can debate on is whether he's gone crazy or not. For someone who thinks he got cheated on his actions make perfect sense. Whether he's crazy for thinking he got cheated on is the real question. Since this is without precedent I'm inclined to trust his judgement for now, but I understand why some people feel differently.  That said anyone who's take boils down to "lol crysen can't take an L" or on the other side "once cheater alweese cheater" needs to bow out though. You people are robots.  In any case,  tournament chess cheating (especially online) is easy enough to do that you might as well have better security. And I think a reasonable precaution for in person events would be to have a broadcast delay. If some allegations start the move towards better security that's not exactly the worst outcome for the chess world. I'd love for Magnus to take Hans up on the offer and for them to do a +12 game grudgematch in a farday cage :>    ..Also why are 80% of the comments shadowbanned? Never seen something like this before...
You can't just digest it so...
I bet magnus does not have any "evidence" or whatever...He just want people to think his oppnent somehow cheated against him without harming his reputation.  but honestly, if he is going to hold this stance for long time, everybody lose their respect for him. Definitely we need his cleare statement on this issue.
Magnus resigned the last match because Hans hired a lawyer to threaten Magus (and others, like Hikaru) with legal action. I would have resigned too.
This is epic. Hahaha. Maxim must have done a great job as a mentor...hahaha. This Maxim Dugly was accused for fraud in Russia in early 2000s, and was later banned from Titled Tuesday for cheating. Interestingly the same man accused another player for hiding a device in his shoes. Magnus knows what he is doing, and doing the sport a great favour.
No they should not give Magnus a break on this he started it as the whole chest World in an uproar and won't say nothing I think he's just scared to play him
Magnus just keeps giving spotlights to no-name chess players
Darn, why didn't she ask his opinion on anal beads? Now we may never know.
Lol magnus reading that from a script
With all due respect maestro Magnus I believe the problem is not Hans, the point is that if he ever could cheat inside the Sinquefield cup, then he may not be unique in that , anyone could  have cheat at least as a remote possibility, and that means the fault is on Sinquefield in-security checking against cheating what we need to blame here, not the players because of other reasons ultimately unrelated to the real purpose of chess.
I half expected Tylor1 to come up yelling "Cheater!!!!"
Magnus is a genius in telling some underlying hints. Look at Niemanns Mentor and the door will open the truth.
Nice league gameplay, thank you youtube.
Magnus is a sore loser
Look what GM Benjamin Bok said. We should focus on the Mentor of Hans Nieman. And his Mentor is maybe cheating at Titled Tuesday all the time. He has a really good performance.
I'm not sure I agree with Magnus logic lately. He expects everyone else to play against someone he thinks is a cheater, but he is privileged and thus does not need to.  I think he's doing it backwards. He should play and NOT talk about it. Otherwise, don't enter the tournament. No one cares about contract obligations.
I think people should really stop making such a fuss about it, really. Magnus stated on Twitter that he would officially withdraw from the tournament out of respect for the players. Now that he did, he is being blamed for things he never stated and everyone wants to hear something THEY want. Maybe put some thought into it and understand that he might also have some personal reasons. Not everything should be about career and drama. Had he not made a public statement on Twitter, the world would have labelled him as disrespectful towards chess players.  Unbelievable. People can trully be crazy sometimes.
man I love chess drama
Well said.
As I've said elsewhere, Magnus made a slight psychological mistake by answering the questions on cheating the way he did when pressed. He was doing quite okay with the broken-record "I can't say anything now, I'll say more after the tournament/at some later time" routine up to that point. Anyway, we'll see.
The interview itself was a game of chess.  Very smartly formulated questions, appreciated by Magnus' smiles
Magnus Carlsen threw a game against Hans Niemann.  Magnus Carlsen cheated and should be disciplined.
The move played by the interviewer happens to the computers best move
Ah I see now, so Hans' coach has been feeding him computer moves during his games, and Magnus' team has has evidence of that. They probably got some hard proof during their game at Sinquefield. But it is hush hush for legal purposes until they hand it over to FIDE for a formal investigation. Interesting!
I think Hans coach may be very dubious Russian guy, who also gives weird analysis of his games.. They both may seem too suspicious...what a mentality......
Pls bro keep your sanity and don't go into Fischer mode
Ah yes league of legends grand champion carlsen
Ikke vik, Magnus. Stå i det og ignorer trollene, svikerne og de som er for ignorante til å vite bedre. På tide at noen tok tak i dette her. Full respekt!
I like Magnus but really disagree with how he is handling this.  If evidence comes out that makes his case I will certainly change my mind but the way it looks now is not good.  Yeah, Hans did cheat when he was literally a no name player in chess and 12, 16 years old respectively.  I don't know how many games he did it but at this point I really don't care.  People need to stop being so self righteous.  NO ONE is perfect and we have all done things in our life we regret.  The last thing we should be doing is ruining a 19 year old's life for things he did when 12 and 16.  Check the hell out of him, do whatever you need to do but to destroy a very promising chess player for making dumb decisions as a minor is just wrong.
is magnus wearing an ami tshirt, thats fire lol
I think players should be forced to arch their backs during play. Only then will the cheaters expose themselves. 😂
LONG LIVE KING MAGNUS....13 YEARS ON THE THRONE ....LET THE HATERS AND CHEATERS  HATE...
HOAX
HN=LA
Didn't know Magnus was also a LoL player
I don't think it's about cheating. If it was, wouldn't it be smarter to continue to play against Hans and then BAM, present the evidence as more games would be played? Because with the withdrawing you just put a lot of heat on the situation which would probably alert Hans to maybe take a step back and stop cheating, if he did offcourse. Also, Magnus chuckled when he said "I'll make a comment after the the tourni and we'll see if it's on this subject or not". I think he finds it's funny how his silence made people draw their own conclusions and how everyone is so dead wrong and is gonna look stupid. You can just see it on his face. That, boy are ya'll gonna look surprised when I finally speak, look. 😅 Just relax. Don't judge.
Magnus should run for president. He would get rid of the corruption.
So professional chess is like bigbrother, paradise hotel or any other shifty rumor based reality show? Idiocracy lvl! If you talk shift you make more money$$$$$
People do not seem to undrestand that Magnus can not talk about the matter legally...
ok so he just said that his mentor basically helped him "cheat" or whatever
All the 'No Comments' speaks for themselves. SMH.
Sure, start a conspiracy for accusing someone of cheating and just based on "trust me dude". i know the dude that been "accused" have cheat in the past, is quite unfair for someone like MC when put something out without any follow up as how this kind of things might screw up other people live.  if somewhere in future this things consider a hoax or false accusation, does the damage that has been done can be reverse?  i cant wait either way if this guy really cheat or not.  it will be a fucking plot twist, if the guy did not cheat and MC should just accept losing game and move on in the first place instead making everything about him.
Magnus: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice can’t put the blame on you. You can never do it to me again. Let ur chess speak itself to others.
Magnus what a guy. He seems like he can't wait to speak more about the drama soon too xD
🐐🐐🐐
There are more comments than views
LOL imagine your own employee grilling you like that. Speaks for a healthy company culture.
So long as he doesn’t say hans wasn’t cheating, it’s obvious what his opinion is on the matter
drama queen magnooose
Can’t take trashtalk 😅😅😅😂
Magnus this whole interview: "uhh yeah uhh uhmm uhhh and uhhhh uhmmm" very annoying
You do realize that this might not be about cheating At all.
Hans did play extremely well in those 2 moves.
bro if it wasnt enough to smear hans name now he brings his coach into it, losing alot of respect for magnus
Maxim Dlugy does sound like an evil mastermind's name.

kinda pointless but if i were the interviewr i would ask Carlsen if he thinks its possible to cheat in big over the board tournament and if he does then how ;)
Niemann didn't cheat in Sinquefield, all the experts have clearly said so. Niemann is 2700 level : 1) Niemann's FIDE blitz rating has increased at the same pace as his FIDE classical rating. It's not possible to cheat in On-The-Board blitz. The fact that his blitz rating is improving at the same pace as his classical rating is a proof that he isn't cheating. See his rating progress chart, on FIDE's website: https://ratings.fide.com/profile/2093596/chart 2) French GM Laurent Fressinet, who has been one Carlsen's seconds, and was rated over 2700 a few years ago (currently 2622 FIDE rating), met with Hans some months ago in Paris. He watched Hans Niemann play a blitz match against MVL (current World Blitz Champion) and "it was very close, MVL won in the Armaggedon". Then he played some blitz against Hans, and Jules Moussard, another French GM (2686 FIDE rating), played some blitz against Hans too, and Fressinet comment is : "he kicked our asses", "he clearly is 2700 level". Listen to his testimony here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmldeic5NF8&t=2389s
I think the fact he hasnt really said nothing explicit yet Everyone made sense about hans cheating is proof enough something is fishy with hans
what's stopping Magnus from speaking more openly. Is it just libel laws or is he bound by contracts on top of that?
Magnus cannot accuse Hans directly of cheating without evidence or else that is a defamation case, that's why he is very careful with his words.
People think "Twitter drama" applies to all professional sports, it doesn't.  I remember recently some e-sports gamers got banned for speaking their opinions on twitter, think about that.   You might find it unfair to be outside the loop but that's how legal things work. EDP445 got away with his creepy stuff because it was posted on YouTube and Twitter.
The increase in the power of technology was always going to make this situation inevitable. It now becomes a matter of whether detection can keep pace with evasion. This has been the situation in other sports for many decades now. For example, athletes are constantly administering new drugs, that the testing regime has not been adjusted to look for. It pretty much destroyed the credibility of athletics. Let us hope that chess doesn't go the same way.
"I think his mentor Maxim Dlugy must be doing a great job" - is he implicating Dlugy in what he thinks is cheating?
literally everyone milking magnus for content and he can't even get 10k views on a video after months of coverage
To me it sounds more and more likely that Hans actually cheated.. Let's wait and see if Magnus actually has some info and if so all the Niemann-defenders will have to take an L.
you cant make accusations wthout proof that can destroy a persons life , you cant call someone a wifebeater, a pedophile or a rapist and destroy his career for example and expect people to just role over if these accusations are untrue, when you call a professional chessplayer a cheater, you take his life away, if you do that and that person says you are going to be sued thats not a threat but just a normal consequence of harmfull toxic behaivior in a democracy where you have rule of law, presumpyion of innocence and all that good stuff. About his cheating in the past, that argument lost all validity the moment it was known he had cheated online, was forgiven and aloud back to play tournements, Magnus played against him in the past with that knowledge but apparently it only started to bother him when he started losing against him, which raises some questions about intellectual honesty, being a hypocrite and a sore loser... my 2 cents
No boyfriend would have gotten away with cheating on this interviewer. She'd have found it quite easy to get the truth out of him.
I am Magnus' kryptonite... he just doesn't want to admit it 😈
Be humble
He didn't mentioned Alireza. Strange
Where can I watch these streams live?
u cant not just love magnus he such a nice guy
I am very impressed by Minus Carlsen's cowardice.
She did it very professionally
Magnus needs to man-up and comment on why he threw a fit and left a tournament, and why he moved one piece and quit. Quitter.  Magnus is just as likely to have cheated on his rage quit as Hans. There's the same proof. Hope Magnus loses to Hans in next game to knock his ego down a notch.
Why does he talk like uhhh uhh uhhhhh uh uhhhhhhh uhuhuhuh
This saga would make a great Netflix series, if it turns out Niemann is indeed everything he's accused of.  What if, in a stroke of genius, Carlsen set up Niemann to make a proper move but knew a computer move would do something else.  I don't know any more chess than what "Queen's Gambit" taught me, but am fascinated that cheating is even possible in chess.
Boooooooooo
So who is Maxim Dlugy? He was in jail in Russia for embezzlement and defrauding hedge fund...omg...So fraudster is training Hans? It's clear then all...
Grow a pair of balls you coward and say what you think, if you're so sure you're right then you won't have to worry about legal ramifications.
The background spoke for itself.
Magnus is GOAT, The king of chess.
I don't understand why it is so difficult in chess to accuse somebody of cheating. Why are you not allowed to speaking out your thoughts? I mean Peole could take it with a grain of salt and also listen to Hans' side.
how annoying
boss knows best
Let's go Hans! I got your back!!
Great questions in this interview, only one I would add is since he said it's easy to cheat, how would he do so over the board.
magnus acting smart is bugging me, i dont think he will ever able to proove hans was cheating, just he got ppl pointing on it, thats as far as he can go right now
This interview is just half “ummm”
The Drama Queen Opening: 1 d2-d4 Ng8-f6 2 c2-c4 Resign...
well we all got blue-balled , why do the interview if u can't comment on the only thing ppl want to hear about
Nos hemos quedao igual 😂
People saying he is a sore loser doesnt make sense. The guy have been playing continuously for ages reaching the highest ever rating for any human and even now can comfortably lose to youngsters (for example recently lost 3 consecutive games to Prag) and applaud them as well. He hates to lose but always gives due credit to his opponents whenever he loses. And now if he has inside info about any investigation about a particularly proven online cheater, or about leaks of his plan, or whatever, he is well within his rights to keep his mouth shut. It's not being a diva, it's just being sensible.
I guess it's contractual obligations not allowing you to talk
Why is that when Magnus gives interviews it is all so calm, but when Niemann speaks it's all rage, pride and fear?? IT's so obvious. But yeah in most other competitive games the anti-cheating defenses have evolved, we would assume it would happen in chess also sooner or later.
Great interview, nicely done.
lessnus crysen
He plays chess with his words too.
It's good to have a rival for motivational purposes
I am sure there is proof that Hans cheated way more online, so his word is worth nothing! It will all come out later on. So Mr. Maxim Dlugy was a great coach!?
Too many questions on cheating. Ending up being a pain in the butt... 🙃
Magnus speaks for himself
Thanks Magnus for the free content
I think magnus knows his opening was leaked based off the coaching comment
"I am impressed by Hans performance. His mentor has "done a really good job"  I get it!😂
Looks like it's easy to make Magnus fall in a trap in an interview. He could have said "of course we all need to do as much as we can to tackle cheating" but instead he suddenly said he would wait the end of the tournament to answer, making clear that he linked cheating to his game with Nieman ...
Good interview. As much as we can expect for now
How are people defending MC?  Either say something or don't.  If you have something on Neiman then what changes by simply playing the matches?  So far the only thing these tantrums and stunts has accomplished is Neiman is now the second most popular chess player in the world.  So... mission accomplished?
This woman is annoying af and doesn’t know how to conduct interviews at all.
This interviewer was really one of the smartest interviewer in the world
Cheating? Cheating? Cheating anybody? What do you thing about cheaters?
Supported Magnus since day one. That’s my bruh bruh. Too many flip floppers out here changing their views every other day.
All my homies hate Hans Niemann - he cheated at 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, BAN FOR LIFE! #BELIEVEMAGNUS
The reference to Maxim Dlugy makes it clear that Carlsen does indeed think that Niemann is cheating. Niemann does not have a coach/mentor and has mentioned this in several interviews. Dlugy is also infamously known for being caught cheating online on numerous occasions even more so than Niemann.
My conclusione Is that Carlsen bully a 19yo
If you don't accuse somebody of cheating, but also don't clear them, you will say as much.  The Norwegian Gods will punish cheaters btw
whos in charge of these channel's thumbnails?
Completely unimpressed, creates all this turmoil and then acts as if he is taking the high road.
Magnus is a sore looser. I Lost my respect
kudos to interviewer girl
Sometimes we make a mistake, no problem, especially not when we reverse our mistakes
Guys - the reason Magnus mentions Niemanns coach GM Maxim Dlugy is because he was also banned for cheating. Also there was some talk about electrical devices in the shoe giving signals through the feet
I just think he cant come out with a real statement due to legal reasons atm. Thats it. Atleast he's not draggin Hans trought the mud atm.
why tf is this under league of legends
it is impressive how Magnus started this campaign of defamation of Hans, because he was losing to him. there is no proof of any Cheating at all, and still, Magnus just because his impulsive rage made him tweet something, then now he has to stand up to it, and on the way damage Hans reputation. DAVID VS GOLIATH....just because he doesn't want to recognize the great player that Hans is becoming. FIDE should just have them play 7 games to see how good Hans is vs Magnus, it seems Hans is moving to a greater level of chess, and Magnus' Gang can not stand for that. Not good at all.
https://youtu.be/ipCSLv9G_Lo One for the algorithm      We have to unite the tribes.  Cocky as always, but he probably deserved it didn't he? Cheats and bullies are the fucking worst, innit?
Магнус мудак раздрожает меня
Magnus: I am really impressed with Hiarcs👽 3000 ELO designers.
Magnus dosent think hans cheated, he just cant handle looking at his beautiful chess play. That's why he resigned in 2 moves.
what. a sack of sh$$
if he thought he cheated why not ask an official to check?  what a sore loser...
Magnus "Sore Loser" Carlsen. Niemann isn't cheating and a young guy shouldn't be bullied and targeted like this because of some mistakes he did years ago as a kid.
game is league of legends?
På tide å slutte å oppføre deg som en primadonna.. legg frem bevisene!  Du har spilt mot mange online juksere, hvorfor lage så mye fuzz om du ikke kan følge det opp?
Let's keep magnus motivated and out of the cave of retirement from being the greatest living person to command a universe of 8x8
.
Thus, Magnus will speak soon And FIDE says they will speak soon I'm waiting for my old dog to speak soon
It is shameful that Magnus accuses without evidence they must stop giving importance to this shameful event
To the people saying Magnus is hurting the chess world and needs to put up or shut up, I really think you're wrong about this one. Magnus has consistently shown outstanding character and is quite humble for a world champion. His credit is good with me. If he strongly suspects Niemann of cheating, which he obviously does, and this is the best Magnus can do at maneuvering the situation, knowing whatever he knows,  do you really think you would play it better than him? Carlsen is no fool.
I dont what people mean by she was a good interviewer😭. Nothing special was going on here
I'm telling you now. The time will come when people will ask the question "why did we think we knew better than the best Chess player who ever lived". Not today. Not tomorrow.
Kaja Snare asked the hard questions well and did a good job of moving forward with the interviews after Magnus gave his response.
Loved the "league of legends" gameplay magnus, thought it was CHESS but apparently it isn't according to Youtube.
Should have asked what happens if they face each other in ko part
Smart interviewer 👍🏼
Magnus Carlsen got Checkmated
At least he said he'll say more after the tournament. That's a bit of a relief.
saying that Maxim Dlugy is Han's mentor is such a passive-aggressive statement by carlsen. Maxim Dlugy is a Russian GM who was kicked from the chess website about 5 years ago for suspected cheating. The implications are clear
Magnus IQ 3000. I love how he hinted "online or otb" when asked about cheating. Also, the Dlugy hint... Maaan, you are a legend. :D
Ah yes League of Legends, my favorite interview show!
i like how its under the league of legends section
Yo what if this whole time Magnus has been cheating
Thank you so much for finally having the courage to shine a light on this and speak about it Magnus! Respect!  However, i don't think it's a goof choice for you to resign, what if he really won man please just take it easy, it could really have been that 1 in a trillion game, please just keep playing and Demolish him! Do not lose it Magnus, please! You need to get the best rating ever in your life and drive it as high as you possibly can, do not destroy that!
He complimented all young players except Hans. Or am I trippin?
I clicked faster on this video than Magnus resigned against Hans.
That’s exactly what I said before he even spoke I said Magness is not going to say one word about what’s been going on with HANS and all this because if he does he can get sued for libel without any proof that Hans cheated so I knew he wasn’t gonna say one word
He thinks he's being coy and careful, but unless he has actual proof of cheating, the slander is still there - innuendo ("people can draw their own conclusions") is just as actionable as if he came right out and accused Nieman of cheating.  Magnus is getting less-good legal advice than he may think he is getting - unless he can prove the cheating, and eventually does, in which case he will have magnified rather than diminished his legacy.
G.O.A.T.🐏
I am not aware of any sport in which cheating is taken so lightly. In any sport except chess when you are caught cheating, for sure you are gonna banned from that sport for a long time. But in chess you are being treated like nothing happened and it's been suggested that the cheater should be caught on every occasion to make his/her results nullified and there is no ban...
Outstanding questions
Don't know if Niemann cheated but we know that he IS a cheater.
If you still haven't gotten it yet. Maxim Dlugy the cheater that cheated Titled Tuesdays (remind you of anyone?) Like teacher like student
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SNAP
Seriously tho why do people want Magnus to say that Hans is cheating? That is a totally bad move and could destroy your career. Obviously you would have to wait for an investigation to happen.  Edit: WOW! I just found out that Hans' coach was even accused of cheating before lmao 🤣 birds of a feather
If Magnus DIDN'T suspect Hans of cheating, he would come out and say. His reluctance to comment on it says everything we need to know.
Guys, read the description. Magnus has clearly written Hans' coaches' name Maxim Dlugy here. Dlugy was the one person who supported Hans during the first wave of suspicions, saying that Hans was a gifted chess player or something similar. If Hans is cheating, his coach is most likely in on it.
please magnus speak on the anal beads
If there was proof it should have come out 1 or 2 days post 'the exit'.  An either way you play the tournament.  This has been just about the poorest response from a professional player of any sport not just chess.  Horribly disappointing to see Magnus do this.
This guy playing chess not checkers
Shocking interview!
Magnus is just a Great guy. I like him so very much. Very nice to have such people in our time. There are not that many. And i dont mean it chesswise..
So will this make Hans fanbois even more insufferable or will the tide finally start to turn ? Asking for a friend
Maxim Dlugy is a GM who is suspected of having cheated in a titled Tuesday event online, and also happens to be one of Hans Niemann's coaches. I find it quite suspicious that Maxim Dlugy was known for having been beating top tier players in blitz at a younger age. He also accused another player of cheating with an electronic device in their shoe. The very fact that he is mindful of some electronic device being a potential route for cheating suggests that he has researched the topic. His past is also sketchy, having been convicted of embezzlement previously.  Maxim Dlugy is known for being an "intuitive" player, and Hans has said the same of himself in a Sinquefield cup interview. Perhaps being an "intuitive" player is code for I don't really want to have to explain my chess moves in detail because they just came to him naturally. I was leaning towards Hans being innocent prior to these revelations, but now I'm leaning more towards Hans being introduced to a cheating method that's much more sophisticated then an electronic device in the shoe by this Dlugy character, who presumably was searching for a young chess prodigy who he knew would not be opposed to breaking the rules (Hans has admitted to cheating using the engine on chess.com).  Of course, there is no concrete evidence of cheating and therefore it is unwarranted to make direct accusations but there should be high suspicions placed on Hans Niemann and his future chess career.
Don't know why but He reminds me of the Chimpanzee who could memorize numbers in their order of appearance in 1/10th of a second.
My predicion: this is all very well staged in order to drum up hype for the first ever $80m purse, chess grandmasters only, boxing match brought to you by Jake Paul & Co.
Based on how many comments are silenced, how many answers arent showing etc. - it seems like FIDE is completely corrupt to the core and Hans is in some way profiteering. Innocent until proven guilty but  everything is reallly weird.
Integrity is more important than money. Unless a personal boundary was crossed this needs to be discussed openly.
Pretty clear Magnus has been instructed not to comment on the subject because he could be liable for some kind of civil court case if he makes an allegation that hasn't been independently verified.  So, his silence for the interim is not by choice, as he probably doesn't want to pay someone a million dollars.  But, it's also pretty clear he will comment on it when he can, and he still thinks this is not resolved and that Hans is not cleared of suspicion.   So the court of public opinion shouldn't be rendering a judgment yet, and yet I see many commenters doing that.
Low IQ Hans fanbois: "I can't believe a pathological liar and habitual cheater has a cheater for a coach!!!" 😆😆😆
If anyone knows anything, they should come out with the evidence now. It's not fair to leave this cloud hanging over both players.
What are we going to do, when we find out Hans has been Neuralinked to Stockfish by Elon?
Imagine playing at the level of 2939, having a record score in the preliminaries, and coming out first, despite giving away free 3 points. This guy is crazy
This interviewer is so subtle and smart  with her questions, we can tell she really prepared this interview so much to get the best answers !
Americans acting like Americans in the comment section, no common sense at all.
somehow this controversy is a good thing for magnus cuz he regained his motivation to beat everyone
Five head conspiracy: Drama will die out soon and in the end Hans got in the quater just because Magnus resigned (if Magnus won Hans would be eliminated)
the chess cannot stop speakin itself
The gears are turning in the low IQ Hans fanbois' heads. Not much brain matter there mind you but it's something 😂😂😂
Superb interview
There appears to be an enormous amount of people unaware of the lawsuits that will *immediately* follow if someone publicly accuses a professional chess player of cheating. This is why Magnus (and everyone else on Magnus' side) is saying little to nothing when asked about Hans Niemann.
Obviously the answer is yes, he'd just say no I don't think he cheats if he didn't.
I think the most important thing he indicated was that he might be able to speak after the tournament is over. I really don't think he can say anything more than he said here, at this point.
Cop-out 😂
Feels like we are in the middle of a Netflix documentary
Everybody hear that ??? It's the mental gymnastics going on in the heads of all of Hans' fanbois 😂😂😂
the most boring interview ever 🙄
Magnus has now directly insinuated that Hans cheated, calling Maxime Dlugy, a GM who was banned for cheating as his mentor. Hans was quite defensive about revealing who his mentor was at the Sinquefield Cup.
Magnus I love you bro but please don't do anything out of a bruised ego and hurt if you are reading this comment that is lol.....please don't let disparaging comments make your mind up but I'm sure you're aware of that. Good luck
0:06 that was the fakest laugh I saw in my entire life
Ok, so in a subtle way he has at least made it clear that it has something to do with Max Dlugy. Comment below, what is that guy's track record? Why would Magnus specifically mention him?
Now it's time for Magnus to speak and give explanations. Otherwise, speculations will go on.
If you cheat in online chess, you will lose more games when you stop cheating, because your rating is higher than it should be. It's really not worth it. If you start, and you can't stop doing it, then the game becomes boring and you will stop playing sooner or later.
there's a typo in the thumbnail fyi
👍😄 MAGNUS😎 ,  Magnuuusssss  🤣 greetings  from  argentina  😄 we  will   always  support  you
Nawala yung topak ni magnus ksi mganda nilalaro nya😂😂😂
Emperessed, seriously ?
1:30 "I think his manager must be doing a great job" To me, that seems suspiciously venomous to the manager more so then Hans.
What a gigachad.. uploads his own interview on his own channel without elaborating
Will you give an interview? Yes. Will you comment on Hans? No.
Here's the thing a lot of people aren't getting. He wants to talk about it. But Hans is a prodigy. FIDE, other chess orgs, they all want Hans in the picture.   The fact that nothing is being said from any side is as much evidence for cheating as could possibly be expected, because if he IS found to be guilty of cheating, that will be buried. It's sort of been an open secret that certain people are chosen by FIDE and can do no wrong. A certain Russian in the 80's being just one example.   Hans is untouchable. Magnus is walking away because he knows he's lost the fight before it started. Doesn't matter if Hans cheated. He could have video proof and FIDE would invoke their confidentiality clauses and bury it. Magnus is already being forced into retirement. If he speaks, they'll strip him of his titles, ban him from FIDE events, ban him from coaching, and sue him for everything he has. Better to retire with dignity than to be forced into disgrace and destitution.
Magnus is the still Fookin CAPTIAN until otherwise stated....
HANS USED ANAL BEADS VIBRATING MORSE CODE IN HIM!!!
Magnus can eat a bag of insert your favorite non censorable word here
Magnus isn't stupid. He knows what he is doing and  time will show whether he is sitting on some information that will show cheating or he is being malicious and trying to drag someone's name through mud. Either way he is doing it very well and making calculated moves. People who think he's just throwing a tantrum are brainlets.
Sadly, the actual issue of "cheating" will have to be addressed. It would be a soul-killing experience to feel you're playing against a computer when you expect to be playing against a human. We can't DO THAT to people -- so a way must be found to insure it can't happen.
Was no one else laughing throughout this interview at how cheeky she's trying to be?? Just me?
Welp it's confirmed about cheating.  Got some new evidence though!  I can't believe Hans had a coach who cheated too! What a turn of events!
I wanna see Hikaru`s smile when he here it )))
She asked questions like a chess master; positioning, maneuvering, tactics and then a draw!!!
Yo why is LoL in the description
impressed by how well he cheats
The chess speaks for itself
2 questions absolutely missed out on.  1) Are you planning on resigning for all possible upcoming matches between yourself and Hans in this tournament?  2) As weeks carry on with no specific allegations or evidence of Hans cheating over the board against you or others, many are beginning to consider your actions irresponsible, improper, and potentially damaging to the career and general well-being of Hans. What can you say in response to these serious allegations towards you?
Until something is presented, I can only say: HANS GOAT
very passive aggressive comments and he should be ashamed for his cowardice
If it turns out that Hans never cheated, this is the biggest compliment he can get. Playing so well that the GOAT of chess accusses you of cheating.
I'm surprised he gave this interview...
Magnus' can rely on his intuition to prove his chess talent through his moves and games, and he may really well trust his intuition about Hans, but Magnus still makes bad moves over the board and I would hate to see somebody's career canceled because Magnus made a bad move off the board until actual proof is provided.  Tournaments relying on Magnus for cheat detection and approval of participants sets a bad precedent if that's the direction we're heading.
Nice interview, MC
Imagine after few days he says"It's a prank".
Smart questions...GM-level... cornered on his own chanel...
Wait a minute, you mean to tell me a self-admitted cheater (that downplayed the amount and severity of his cheating mind you) who didn't want to tell us who his coach was, actually has a cheater for a coach ??? Mind blown 🤣🤣🤣
You better have the goods Magnus, cause this is getting ridiculous.
What I want to know is why was Elon Musk so quick to get invovled with Hans Neimann. He is trailing Neuralink chip in head on people right now, not a conspiracy, even reported by the mainstream media. It would be quite the turn up if Hans Neimann actually was part of that Trial as it would mean he is cheating.
Mangus is lacking character
It should have been in Magnus own interest to keep his mouth shut. Even now he should just clearly state that for legal reasons, e.g. defamation, he was advised by his lawyer not to speak and that people will just have to wait for the dust to settle.  What Magnus did was willingly and knowingly create a huge Shitstorm for himself and Hans which is going to haunt them both for weeks. They are both being scrutinized, criticized and implicated in wild conspiracy theories and they will both undoubtedly come out looking worse at the and of it all. While they are still performing well, I can't imagine their mental well-being isn't suffering, particularly that of Hans. Not to mention all the tournaments, participants and chess as a whole that have been negatively impacted.  And for what? Because Magnus couldn't keep get a hold of his emotions and went to whine on Twitter? You'd think an experienced GM would be familiar with the concepts of logic and consequences for your own actions, on and off the board.
Well said. He has his opinion. No harm.
The fact that Hans' second is kept secret is already strange, knowing now that it was Dlugy, which had suspicions back in the days for cheating, not proven if I'm not wrong, in fact in the Titled tuesday,seems to not help Hans' case.
Why are so many comments being deleted!? What the heck is going on
lol http://puu.sh/Jmsxx/839b78be01.png
The worst interview I have ever seen
I bet Gothams title will refer in some way to this interview. Anyone that wants to bet against?
Magnus you are a disgusting person and a bully! You aren't deserve to be called a champion you should be ashamed of yourself! You are arrogant and you should be banned from this tournament
Hans Cheatmann or Hans "The Engine" Niemann Like for Cheatmann, Retweet for "The Engine" oops this isn't twitter 🤣🤣🤣
The high IQ 2020's chess strat. Imply cheating. Create a rivalry for show. Score a multimillion $ celebrity boxing match between 2 chess players for Youtube.
This is like pulling teeth
anyone find it odd his last statement on cheating was after the tournament I'll tell weather it was that or Something else? why say that last part🤨
The fastest I've ever clicked on a video
Just look at the chaos in these comments. Magnus has thrown the proverbial poop at the fan and walked away. There is a lot of explaining to be done.
Tread carefully, little Hans Moke. You f*d with the wrong world champion! Those who sow wind, will reap storm!
Can’t decide if the thumbnail is extreme sarcasm or what lol
Blitz or bullet over the board to qualify for championships
There's a possibility that Hans Niemann had injected a morse code chip in his body therefore the security scanning is not able to detect
Magnus dodging those questions faster than a rook jumping across the board
damn nice league of legends vid
Chess is dead. And Corona killed it.
Magnus is handling this like a child. You lost, own it and move on. All great champs lose time and time again.
Who the hell is the is lady honestly. Get her off immediately. Absolute rubbish.
*game: League of Legends*
clickbaited, hikaru better low diff.
do people actually believe that hans had a butt plug that was feeding him moves in morse code or some similar device that was allowing him to cheat? does the sinquefield cup not have metal detectors?
"I have no comment on that" interpretation "it is about him cheating"
"I think his mentor Maxim Dlugy must have been doing a great job" hmm... 🤨🤔
Finally an interview with the world champion himself. This is a first start to relieve the tension in the position/discussion.
During the Sinquefield Cup Hans lost many games and tied many games and only won once and it was against the best chess player in the world. Hans had the lowest rating out of the 10 participants so Magnus assumed he was an easy win but he lost so he thought something is unusual.
chess speaks for its self
The question now is will Hans throw his cheating coach under the bus ? We know he's morally reprehensible, but will there be honor among thieves (cheaters)? "I only cheated because my coach told me to! And he showed me how because he himself did it!" 🤣🤣🤣
This whole situation os ridicilous and basically Magnus acting like a little child.
After this interview I think hans is cheating
Wasnt Maxim Dlugy caught cheating on titled tuesday some time ago?
it seems obvious to me that magnus knew of hans' online exploits and a combination of playing bad and possible foul play made him mad at sinquefield and since hans admitted to cheating online in the open before this tournament magnus simply refuses to play him on principle that he has cheated at all regardless of if he was completely legitimate OTB
Shame on Magnus for acting as a child handling his first lost over Hans !
Stop acting like a looser.
you and your girlfriend hikaru owe an apology to neiman
"Should I believe someone who is the strongest chess player to ever live and trying to tell us that a certain person is cheating in chess? Obviously not because my rating is 800 and I dont understand how can a cheater play few inaccuracies and still cheat during crucial moves, I dont understand how someone can cheat in OTB wheras there has been many proven reports of cheating in OTB and subsequent bans but I am too stupid to search internet. I dont believe Hans can cheat ever again because he already cheated twice, so obviously he cannot cheat again."- Ardent Hans fan
His mentor who? Maxine what? Did anyone catch that last name?
Imagine instead of asking Magnus about cheating, Julius ask him about his homosexuality.
Everyone is so pressed on why magnus isn t speaking openly about the situation while it’s pretty clear in my opinion that legal reasons are getting in the way of him speaking. Just be patient cause in my opinion Magnus won’t let this sit without an explanation, chill and wait..
Niemann'ın üzerini arıyorlar ve hiç bir şey çıkmıyor. Hile varsa da şu şekilde olabilir. Niemann 19 yaşında. Genç bir insanın kulağı 20 Hz. ile 20000 Hz. arasını duyar. Yaşlandıkça, bu frekans aralığı düşer. Niemann genç olduğu için, bu frekansları rahatlıkla duyuyordur. Odasında, 19000-20000 Hz. frekans ses veren bir cihaz olabilir. Bununla sinyal veriyorlar ve nasıl oynayacağını frekans ile söylüyor olabilirler. Odasına sound dedektör koymaları şart. Başka da bir ihtimal kalmıyor zaten.
I think there needs to be a drug test like the Olympic Athletes go through, so there is no brain enhancing drugs rolling.  Thank you for giving the interview.  I'm surprised no one has talked about Hanz mentor? No interview?
Magnus did the talking
My Colleague is a cheater but I have no evidence… 😢
Good interview... no tolerance with cheating in chess, please...Carlsen is not just world chess champion, he is also a Brave fighter, smart ,kind and honest person too...he is telling all he can tell us by now i guess...Best wishes in the future for chess world and Carlsen too
No matter the outcome, I have worse respect for the sport as a whole. Technology will only get better and young new talents will always be looked at skeptically because the technology exists and we could just never know. The atmosphere has been created. RIP Chess; Long live Chess.
magnus looks like hes seen better days
We should all be thankful that someone as powerful as Magnus has brought this up to the whole world, even in this painful way. It is needed long time ago. Not accusing Hans, he should be innocent until proven otherwise, but here is the point THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT UP TO THE CHALLEANGE TO TELL. The system (leading chess organizations) is way behind today' challenges. Either this scandal will push for corrections, so the system catches up and improve, or we are going to see a total mess and uncertainty.  With this huge lack of control from the system, you can't blame Magnus - or someone else tomorrow - for not showing a proof, simply it's not their job, it's the system's job to make all players confident that they are 100% safe from cheating. If you can't do it, if you are not sure what last technology can bring, please leave it for someone capable.
Plot Twist: Magnus has been cheating his whole life and he's panicking because he figured out that Hans learned his method too
Where is the MAGNUS army at? NO TO CHEATING IN CHESS! NIEMANN OUT IF PROVEN GUILTY!
This woman is pure cringe
Here we se again why Magnus is a genius. He said positive things about Niemann to activate guilt feelings. If I knew my daughter is cheating I would do the same. I woould constantly say how proud I am until she comes out and confesses.
Magnus speaks for himself
When are the tournaments over?
Garbage behavior by the world champ. Unwilling to break some unspoken rule by telling us what he is up to. But willing to break rules such as dropping out of a Round Robin, and throwing a game on purpose.  History will not look kindly on this, even if Hans cheated.
This is some of the best League of Legends content on youtube
Magnus please be brave and say what most of us are sure about : Hans is a selective engine user, he is getting sophisticated assistance ( not always a top engine move )  to get away with it.  the way he crushed Levon ( g4) , Chucky and Duda is insane. the guy was 2450 2 years ago !
Give him a break. He is entitled to his own opinion. It's not like he is asking organizers to throw hans out instead he himself quit.   If he feels like hans has cheated and doesn't want to play him it's his choice. The only people who can demand explanation is the FIDE ethics board and even they called this a silent protest rather than disrespect.   I like how everyone on the internet is entitled to their opinion but god forbid the literal world no. 1 has an opinion on someone with a shady past in a sport he dedicated his life to!   You go magnus. The drama will eventually die out. Glad to see you are able to perform at such a stellar level in this tournament 🎉
This whole chess phy-op just keeps going further
Quite nonchalant. Disappointing.
LET'S GO MAGNUS!!!!!!!!!
Two Norwegians speaking together in their second language.
Clearly he cannot speak because he has already made a complaint but it is confidential and this cannot be explained now
Everyone's talking about how Magnus isn't saying much but nobody's talking about how this interview took place in a game of League of Legends 🤔
coward
5k views 47 minutes
genius
Kaya is so irritating, she keeps asking about that topic. must be so awkward at the set.
Such a class by Magnus!! I love how he keeps cool in every comments on Niemannn.
Seems to be quite a cryptic statement insinuating Maxim Dlugy was helping Hans during their game. The way he delivered the 'i am very impressed' sounded not in the admirable meaning direction but more towards suprised in my opinion.
Who the hell is Maxime Dugly? Why the hell Magnus "cannot" speak freely? If someone is trying to keep involved people quiet, why don't those issue a statement?
These peoples brains don’t even work the same as normal or even expert players during chess. I’ve never heard of GM Hans to ever best GM Nakamura or even draw. He was put on the chopping block first round and the prestige of taking his loss respectfully was hard. If GM Hans somehow had the talent to best GM Magnus everyone would’ve seen it coming because he would’ve been winning other tournaments with ease.
Magnus (Translation):  I will allow the rest of the world to do the talking for me so I don't have to take responsibility for my words when it comes back to bite me.
El tipo está jugando con el algoritmo de aphacero15 y magnus lo sabe pero no tiene pruevas
“I’m okay, doing my life, hammering proof less suspicions on a 19 years old as the world champion, is nice”
It's Just so unreal too see someone so determined and passionate about, and not only that, his constant hardwork and the never ending learning spirit over the years. This guy (MAGNUS 👑) deserve to be respected.
This interview is pretty dissapointing ngl
He probably knows something we dont, we should not be so quick to judge.
Hans Cheatmann a bigger fraud than Claude Bloodgood
Such accusations without tangible proof is outlandish and unbecoming of a champion. Sounds like a sore loser to me.
Is he accusing Niemans mentor?
She asked a bit way too many questions.. especially when Magnus told he will release a press note after the tournament 🤷
Agreed
Im ngl ive become a massive fan of magnus. Bit of a legend imo. edit: interviewer also does an excellent job
I see a man with principles trying to navigate a tricky path and taking big hits while doing so. I wish him all the best.
sets record even with losing a game on purpose GIGACHAD
Magnus is just jealous of the new bad boy. He is behaving like a teenager
Kaja absolutely doing an amazing job here
Personally, I believe that Magnus has a strong reason to believe that something strange is going on...
Where will the goalposts move to when it comes out Hans cheated OTB? Asking for a (non-cheating) friend 🤣🤣🤣
Based Magnus for being patient and smart. He can play chess-like in real life, it seems. The obvious truth will come out eventually and all the whiners and naysayers will shut their mouths.
Coward 🤗
You can’t punish suspicion that is an idiotic thought.. cheaters are still losers
It's going nowhere and no amount of chess community pressure is going to change that. Time to let it go and move on, stirring things up into a frenzy is wasted energy.
cheating or not, Hans got the most incredible rise in FIDE chess ranking. For me its kinda suspicious, he got more or less 1 year to jump from 2500 +/- to 2700 rating. Even Magnus needed more or less 2,5 years to achieve it
Magnus next move will be to grow a long beard and ask for political asylum in Iceland.
At the end of the day of RR group,his in the top of other player
I think Magnus must have bet all his money on Hans in that match so he resigned that match.
Heil Magnus
It takes two people to cheat, the player and the unknown person behind the curtain.
The interview speaks for itself.
Hans didn't cheat Magnus is washed and a sore loser. Easy clap so many of you are mad it's so sad yet so funny
i like how the game taf is league of legends real mental game!!!!
If you don't want to be asked questions or answer them, then just behave like a normal person and play against your opponent. You're acting like you don't want to accuse anybody, but you're certainly willing to cast a shadow on someone's reputation with zero accountability for your actions. Either you know some cheating was involved and you speak out, or you don't and you let it go.
Cause Magnus is the biggest loser in Sports History....nice Magnus congrats
In previous interview, Hans would not say who his mentor is. So is Maxim Dlugy, another banned cheater, his mentor really? That would be a bad look.
seems to me that he doesn't want to play against players who were caught cheating in the past, to not legitimize their acceptance to such tournaments .doesn't need to add anything
Go Magnus!
he is not cashing in on this era of chess celebrity like other people are and this is the reaction
What a wimpy interview.  He's jeopardizing a fellow chess player's career but cannot offer any substantial evidence that Hans is cheating.  My opinion of Magnus has suffered recently, to say the least.
Magnus got beat against black pieces, either he has discovered evidence after that game so he wouldn’t play Hans again OR he’s just a cry baby trying to cause speculation. We shall see
History
In 2013, Dlugy helped catch a chess cheat who used a device in his shoe. Not sure if that's what Magnus is alluding to.  Also not sure what legal advice he's getting or if he's concerned about international slander laws. Here in the US , you can state facts as facts and suspicions as suspicions. Insinuating facts you aren't stating... that might be shakier ground. Clearly EVERYONE has understood Magnus as saying he believes Hans cheated. That is more troublesome legally than if he said that he believes it to be true but can't say for sure and it is only an opinion.
My god watching him in interviews is like going to the dentist
Waste of my time
I didn't know how coward was Magnus. He needs to know that as the world's champion he has some responsibilities of his acts. Everything he says (or don't) directly interferes and influence opinions of millions of players around the world.  It's kinda disappointing to see the strongest player being so weak in the real life. Seems like he went back to his adolescence, acting like an adolescent.  I used to like him, but I'm already used to see disappoinments like him in my life. No new thing under the sky.
Magnus is just playing for fun and is retiring.  Magnus does not give a crap about what happens…magnus was just pissed that Hans was the one that beat his winning streak
Magnus is a MEGAMAN! Big ups bro!
Hans is a cheater boi
Magnus wants to elaborate on cheating, but just offers hints instead. Can't blame him really, as he's liable to get sued for anything he can't fully prove.
YouTube really saying this is league of legends lmao
People don't even understand why he refrained from accusing Hans and are just commenting bad stuff about him.
The interviewer  is so clumsy with her questions…
Time to swallow your pride and admit you erred Magnus…come on man!
Make an ask Magnush anything about chess.
The plot thickens.
I think Hans Niemann has hidden the device near his brain after the surgery. Maybe it can be possible.
PURE SPECULATION AND FOR FUN. I think Magnus was alluding to something when he mentioned Maxim. Of course Mangus can't speak officially, especially as he could face lawsuits and it's hard to prove physically.   in October 2013 at the Blagoevgrad Open in Bulgaria; "GM Maxim Dlugy had a theory as to how Ivanov was cheating. He believed that Ivanov was hiding something in his shoes, pointing out the large size of his sneakers and the manner in which Ivanov was walking."   "In Round Seven, Dlugy and Ivanov were scheduled to play one another.   Dlugy first asked for a body check before their encounter in round seven.  After the metal detector found nothing, Dlugy then asked for the shoes to be checked.  That�s when Dlugy made a surprise move � he took off his own shoes and dared Ivanov to do the same.   In Round Seven, Dlugy and Ivanov were scheduled to play one another.   Dlugy first asked for a body check before their encounter in round seven.  After the metal detector found nothing, Dlugy then asked for the shoes to be checked.  That�s when Dlugy made a surprise move � he took off his own shoes and dared Ivanov to do the same.   Here is what happened according to an interview with GM Max Dlugy.  �Without a word I take off my shoes, I take off my socks and throw them to the floor � just ba-doom, there, I�m done, bare feet, now show me your shoes, please.  What happened next was completely unexpected. The guy (Ivanov) just goes �I categorically will not take off my shoes.  My socks smell.�  At this point my friend says: �I guess that would be forfeit, right?�  Ivanov says: �if you have to forfeit me, forfeit me.  But I will not take off my shoes.� (Metaphorically, Hans won't take of his shoes and continues to play so Magnus chooses to resign)  The arbiter said to Ivanov: �You realize that you will not only lose this match, but I will also have to disqualify you from continuing to play in the tournament, and no one will play you ever again.  All you have to do is to take off your shoes.�  Ivanov shook his head no.   The arbiter actually tried to convince him for another couple of minutes, but Borislav was categorical about it: �No way I�m taking off my shoes.  No way!�  So the director shrugs and says �Okay, I�m putting in a zero.�   After this incident, a theory was started about what might be happening here.  A modern Android or Apple smartphone easily fits into a shoe.  A person can use his toes to send signals to the motion detector in the phone.  Little wiggles will do it. Or the toe can be used to tap on the LED screen.  The response of the phone would be short bursts of vibration. An app could handle the interface to a chess engine running on the device.   https://ssqq.com/archive/cheatingneverwin.htm
The pieces are all starting to fall into place. Maxim Dlugy the guy that cheated Titled Tuesdays (hmmm know anyone else who did that?) just happens to be Hans' coach. This is going to be hilarious when it all comes to light the extent of Hans' cheating which absolutely includes OTB chess. You insufferable fanbois are in for a real treat. 🤣🤣
pathetic
Fide is joke .no action nothing one is insinuating withdrawing tournament. Protesting by forefeting games is he that big .even Fisher did such thing . Even tennis legend Djokovic tantrums are not taken by tennis association here one guy calling shot and ready to what he want and can't justify action
if anyone can confirm, is this his official channel
Can't wait for the bomb Magnus will drop next week which will shut tons of patzers' mouth
more than impressed
at this point im waiting for Magnus to grow a full beard and move to Iceland
Magnus is a poor speaker, I have to say. Incredibly inarticulate.
Like old says.. Time will tell..
Tasteless interview, on both sides, painting Hans in a terrible light for something with still no evidence. If Magnus can't speak on the topic then why are they doing an entire interview about cheating? Just so he can create heavy implications by dancing around the subject to influence the chess world?
If you are going to accuse him, just do it already. You are losing a lot of credibility here.
Meh.... Drama over... neimann got his week of fame
Why is the game League of Legends 🤣🤣
I cannot help but be Magnus-biased, still
His actions speak louder than his words but I don’t necessarily mean it in a good way
He says he is impressed yet he has alleged him of cheating and refused to play him because of that. Which one should we take lol  I guess he is now covering his b#tt legally 🖤 Oh well magnus
Is there any bet to a chess match? Because what magnus did was so related
From 1:25 to 1:37 Magnus is refering to Maxim Dlugy who has an history of cheating. Maybe he is Niemann second who was unknown. My guess is that when Carlsen, at the Sinquefield Cup, discovered Niemann past cheating history online, his interview after the game and that Dlugy was his second, He thought that it was Dlugy himself that was helping in some way Niemann to cheat OTB suggesting maybe the right moves to overcome algorithm detection. That's why now he says explicity the name of Maxim Dlugy adding that he did a great job, at least that's my interpretation.
This guy is a clown
HOT TAKE>>record score... what if Carlsen started cheating because he is pissed???
So 1.) According to Hikaru a player who played at the SLCC was also almost certain Hans was cheating  2.) Magnus clearly knows the conclusions being drawn about Hans and if this wasn’t about cheating or if Magnus did not suspect Hans was cheating then he wouldn’t just let Hans character and reputation just get tarnished like this I think there is a process that Magnus has to go by so let him focus on the chess for now and hopefully after the tournament we can get some more clarity
what will magnus do if he meet hans at final
bruh
without the free win from Carsel, Hans would have been 8th, keep crying Hans fanboys XD
I feel like Magnus was testing Hans to see if he was cheating and to see if Hans' coach was feeding him information. Once Magnus got what he was looking for, he drew.
The GOAT, pay attention now, y'all
The engine will speak for itself
I don't think Magnus will try to ruin anyone's career just by suspension, he must have something!
waiting for levi's recap like...
Amazing player and a real sportsman.
what a sarcastic pointing comment on hans niemann's second.
TL;DR - Magnus will make a full statement regarding anal beads after the tournament.
Great questions!
Just speak plainly man
Why is the category League of legends ☠️
Magnus haters: LOOK HE'S BECOMING BOBBY FISHER  Magnus:
Drama happening everywhere
I think he had a breakup recently
bro, that interviewer asked such good questions plus she looks beautiful :)
I think at this point it's pretty clear Hans has cheated ON Magnus with his mentor.
class act by Magnus.. still think Niemann cheated though
Still with the "I can't speak about it" circus show?? Is he afraid of the Chess Mafia or what?? 😂😂
Magnus isn`t the judge of the chess world. He must be banned for his behaviour.
nailed magnus on the question, well done. anyway, sympathetic guy.
Max Dlugy cheater?
he he he has my name
Can someone point me to  a video of Hans playing before this whole drama came about ? I'll admit I don't everyone on the FIDE list, but before the Magnus V Hans game that started all of this, I'd never heard of Hans. Now he's everywhere.
Starts at 0:58
I can't say anything-but people can draw their own conclusions and they certainly have. How can you say Hans is a cheater without saying it lol .
Magnus is the 🐐!
You better retire champ.
Magnus Lost ALL my respect. Hes literally destroying (or trying) Hans career and chess itself with literally no proof. Thats coward and imature...
Respect to the interviewer for pressing him
I love Magnus and if I were norwegian I would probably defend him until hell, still this interview is one of the worst example of journalism I've ever seen, she might as well started to lick his butt live during the interview. Hans deserves better, and we deserve explainations. Magnus has to explain, and someone has to ask him: "Are you aware that your tweet and your behaviour might be causing heavy distress to a fucking teenager and that you didn't show any freakin' prove to justify all of this?"
Magpus Quittsen. Such a cryboy. Disgusting.
People saying this is a targeted attack against Hans because Magnus is scared. Hans isnt even the young prodigy that came on top in Julis Baer. Magnus is also leagues ahead of everyone else in the chess world right now clearly. Like holy hell people just wait until after the tournament and then we can understand what Magnus is doing.
what if they want a new Champion? 🙄
Interesting. Hans' background team has been kept under wraps, Hans himself was very reluctant to namedrop anybody he's working with, yet Magnus has gone all out to reference Max Dlugy. No doubt he'll be hauled in front of a camera before long.
if someone was giving him the moves... maybe it explains when he played C3 instead of G3, if you know the game you know what i mean... C3 was the worst move possible, there was just NO 1 good reason for him to play C3, NOT ONE.. yet he did when the winning move was G3... clearly he missunderstood the hint hahah
Man of his Character 👍🏻
The interviewer did a great job.
Interviewer asked the questions very smartly and kinda got the answer out even though magnus was unwilling to speak. I'm impressed.
How a winner became a loser. A big one👎🏼
It's so fucking obvious Hans is a cheater. He would had accepted the 1 Million dollar offer to play naked if he was genuine, I'd play chess naked for a few hundreds, who would'nt play for a MILLION. LET MONEY SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
Everyone please don't judge Carlsen before his statement. You might change your opinion since it is based on NO EVIDENCE, but Magnus MIGHT have it.
Hikaru is rubbing his hands right now! New content...
Magnus is taking advice from George RR Martin.   "Oh my statement is coming, and its gonna be HUGE"
3:30 0h the smile of a guilty man. She hit the nail on the head clearly.
Magnus doesn worry nomore about Hans, because Hans' Kryptonite is Praggnanandha. Magnus is fully thankful for Pragg, because he destroyed Hans yesterday
Maybe he knows that someone stole his preparation , but has no material proof to make it public . Just a supposition
Seems like Magnus didn't say anything new but...He mentioned one name, Maxim Dlugy which Kaja catched up. Magnus is giving hints between words because he cannot say it openly. I really hope that he is right about Hans that he cheated in some ways. Otherwise Magnus' name will be put in shadow forever..
League of Legends XD
Very professional interview.
Damn i kinda feel sad about Magnus he gives is life to the chess and something like this breaks his mood and enthusiasm about chess. But i want to learn what is going in his mind. Like give us something but i think he can't for some reason i can't understand why.
Shut up, chess speaks for itself      PS: I have a duck video, a chicken video, a video where i am begging for money on Twitter, a walking video, a video where i am playing with my nuts. A short with a blog. A Naruto Arena video... Also a patreon
😐
Carlsen is gutless. Accuse him, or STFU.
Wow, so straight called out Maxim Dlugy 1:24.  So is he stealing prep or something?
That was a brilliant defense and attack at the same time.  The questions were so obvious and hilarious 😂😂
Practically speaking,it takes very high iq to understand what magnus means and whatever he does has a meaning, legend🔥🔥🔥🔥
Glad to see Magnus in good spirits. I totally get why he thinks that saying more at this point is not a good idea. And yes, I am sure his suspicions are justified.
Rumor has it that Magnus heard how successful the pulsing anal beads were and he decided to use them for game two, but they weren't calibrated correctly so he resigned.
The whole thing is getting politics now. It feels like Foxnews trying to interview a president.
I like magnus
Im glad legal action has been threatened. You need hard proof before making accusations.
Kaja should have busted his balls with harder questions I wanna know if Magnus will ever play Hans again?
Pathetic excuses still.
I feel like the person that runs his youtube is pretty tone deaf pretty consistently.
By the way, Max Dlugy was also caught cheating in Titled Tuesday some years ago.
Looking forward to hear what he has to say after the tournament.. Important subject and Hans is a known cheater online
Magnus never said anything about cheating. He never said anything, period, and he's not liable for people's imagination.
why didn't she ask: if you and hans would meet in the finals, would you play?
i hope they ban hans after this tournament. so sad maggy has to not speak about it due to legal reasons. justice is coming tho!!!!
Legal ramifications lol
You have to remember Magnus is the WC so maybe he's like on a contract or something where he can't directly say certain things. I highly doubt MAGNUS would just let someone get away without being forced to. He's a smart player and smart person, who knows his motives, who knows if Hans is cheating. Magnus knows things, probably things we will never hear.
I can’t believe Ive forgotten to watch todays livestream! So much has happened and I missed it all
News, but sorry, no news
He also cheated, that's why. End of story.
Some people are chess genius but Magnus is a genius at everything.Well done,no upcoming legal actions,nobody can accuse him.
Wat
It's getting kinda annoying, like a tv reality show. People should know answers, especially Magnus fans. It got way out of hand.
why is she interviewing? She doesn't have a clue about chess!
People should understand that him not going straight to the point and dodging questions is not really like putting his head under the sand, right now he cannot speak, at all, regarding hans cheating because he might face legal consequences.  I understand that he might be waiting for investigations/intels/etc. to unfold before diving further into the thing.  He likely knows something is going on since he said he’s gonna speak more about it after the tournament ends.
"Is FIDE doing enough?" "Hmmmm, it's hard to say really." Translation: NO THEY ARE NOT.
El Magneto shall bring clarity to the cheating of Hans.
I hope that you win. I don't care at all about the drama.
Which part of "If I speak I'm in trouble" isn't clear?  He can't publicly speak about what happened because he's limited by the agencies and secrecy. It's not a simple "I accused Hans", there is a process behind their actions that is bigger than Magnus himself
Not sure how i feel about all of this drama. But he really should speak what is on his mind instead of being passive agressive about the hans situation
Magnus: Tells the world he’s impressed with Hans’ play while saying who Hans’ coach is when Hans wanted to keep it silent. Hans: Says Magnus is his hero while taking passive aggressive crap. … Me: Hyper intelligent child egos fighting and I can’t stop watching it… Says more about me, I think.
He will look like a total idiot if hans is not convicted of cheating.
biggest balls award goes to: kaja marie snare XD
So is he insinuating that it's Maxim Dlugy that is feeding Hans the moves?
You've been on a roll for awhile Magnus. Better you say nothing about #LongHairs. Time will tell. Adelante Senor Magnus.
Maxim Dlugy is the mentor of Niemans cheating
She did a really good job of trying to get info out of him in the matter by making generalizations. Guess we'll see at the end of the tournament what this what all about.
He is a cheater obviously
I used to really like Magnus. Can't say that I like him much anymore.
Little bit too much push for those cheat questions
Magnus knows how to avoid a trap, be it on the board or in an interview
united states of airheads
And here Iam it's 1:16am I have work technically to say today 😂 but just wanted to see what Magnus has to say I'll just wait for the end of the tournament...
So he will speak further after the tournament. Very well. This was something huge for chess and many eyes will be on it if he decides to do it on a interview style format
His laugh😂
Magnus is a master of psychological warfare, got the whole chess word in chaos…
Cheating is really 😞
It’s about time MC comments on the Niemann case. This half in half out is just bad etiquette, cause Magnus is fully aware of the implications for Hans.
Magnus has the biggest ego in history
You will not comment on thattttt?
Glad to hear Magnus again!
Say something..!!
😙😙😙😙
PepeLaugh
"I cannot comment on that". So this is a legal matter...
I wish he would just speak plainly about it. It was nice of him to say he was impressed with Hans and his mentor tho, assuming that was meant to be interpreted as compliment.
here before hikaru reacts
Maxim Dlugy is the name
Magnus the GOAT.
Stupidest drama ever, grow up
Magnus weak Hans beat u butt haha
Magnus keep going and don't play against cheaters. You are the best!
Magnus you need to explain or your legacy will be tainted
Man, she is asking tough questions
Magnus' 34 points speak for itself
what
He looks fresh, even with that dogshit haircut
Impressive 2 moves yes
i can't dance, i can't daaaance, the only thing bout me is the way i walk
Magnus you kind of low for this
Crack 💜
Hi champion

Let's go!!!
❤ you

Was waiting for this
Jokadej
