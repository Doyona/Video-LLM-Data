Man i been sleepin!! now hearing these track wayne killing again still the GOAT
"LET HIM WHO IS UNJUST, BE UNJUST STILL. LET HIM WHO IS FILTHY, BE FILTHY STILL."
Tell grandma im faded. Pourin' cups out, instead floating on 80! Smoked up, way out in these clouds tone is way up, free fall on they base-hit. Charcoal, no filters, I'm insane my clips just grazed on they chins. Now my weight been outrageous, corporate sponsors sign on his name, and end up chronic like patients. Performance is everything. I point it down range, now my money is milky. I whip it, the coldest, I froze it they necks been so choked when I'm smoking on sherbet. This cookie's the monsta, cause you know a busta's been lippy. Kush in my swisher, mush when I'm trippin.  Syrup so sticky, the woods been so muddy. I stumble on hives and find all your honey. Now all my liquor's delicious. Bumbu when I'm jacked, and this amp for my rhythm. A finer synapse, I understand ya position. 95 with the physics, live in dimension the diamond on grid. Locked on my targets like heat seeking missiles.
My birthday is cummin' everybody on Pinterest vöö doonTİMe! ;"NOW!🇯🇲😡😇🙃🤧💔👺🇭🇹🇧🇪🇬🇼♥️💤🙃😁🤐🦴🥳🧐😆😏🌚**

Wayne is a whole ass mood
5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. -HOLY BIBLE

Wayne is at the top of Rap even though he doesn’t impact the digital dash. Wayne is the general of the entire army on his side. There are two sides to rap. They either at War, or they have a Mercedes ☮️ Treaty. You just don’t know about it. You don’t know what the subject is so you don’t know what you are looking for. Here are your clues:  1.) Doesnt matter if you are in the same camp, label, or if you are thought of as friends. That could be the dude on the other side.  You still work with him, but he is your biggest enemy.  2.) Public could hear two artists dissing someone else. Another team. But really they dissing each other subliminally on the same track.  3.) All the lyrics are coded. There is a ton of Banging going on in the lyrics. Even your most softest artist is probably laying down some banging from one side or the other. You just missed it. Not all of them are going to bang like Wayne: I throw up them B’s high as the moon suwoo and space.  4.) Real beefs don’t hit the public. Two big artists don’t beef publicly. They SUB IT. Some of your favorite songs are diss tracks. Almost everything is a diss track. Even the love songs.  5.) Throw out everything you know. And all beefs start with a bitch they both banged.
Lyrically incomparable real genius 🐐🐐🐐🐐

I will go a Lil Wayne show and cry
I grew up without a Father. So many walk that same path of life, never knowing the TRUE guidance a Father can provide, the sense of protection, the unwavering love a Father is supposed to extend to his children.  It only got harder once I had children of my own, HOW do I be a Father, when I don’t even know what it means…so many abandon their children asking that same question to themselves.  God changed everything, God began showing me what it meant to love, to care, to nurture…but not just my children, but those around me “thy neighbor”.  I realized I knew no Father, just so I could come to know THE FATHER, when the time was right 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽  We are going to have “Moments of Uncertainty”  But that is not as important as the element you use to relieve yourself. Many followers of Christ are still indulging in our vices and addictions to relieve our “Uncertainties”  Lean on God in your darkest moments, lean on the word that says you were created with meaning and purpose, lean on the Grace of God…let it steady your mind, your heart and your body.  I don’t know who I’m writing to, who’s reading this, but God is ready, and waiting for you to seek him, through Jesus Christ, whom he sent to die the death meant for you and I.  Not just on Sunday, not just when you “need” him, not just when you’re desperate…but every day, hour, minute and second of your life.  Develop consistency in Christ, and you will come to know what it means to “Be still, and know, that he is God”  Glory be to God 🩸🩸🩸  If I still have you here, God bless you, join me as I take you inside a moment of my own personal “Uncertainty” in life, while never forgetting God has me always 🙏🏽🕊  https://youtu.be/VXfWQtxnwqc  🕊🕊🕊

I want a trust fund babies 2 & 3!
@liltunechi buy apple or microsoft. Lets develop games. I prefer apple for not having any games YET but good music software plus apple car. But a global census for all continents to buy (6) companies not of their nation could be had and then pro picks from presidents to complete the censuses would be dope. At least gives lesser weathly nations a chance to grab a fortune company.
Who want the V.S with WAYNE!?!
Wayne still making Numbers even with a weak Feature like Rich the kid #Ymcmb  3.4M Legend
Thnx copi
Bro Wayne the goat like the goatttttt

Crazy how that truck fit hoodie isn’t out of style. It’s like Travis barker wearing famous stars n straps. The creator of it is timeless. Same with Pharrell and ice cream. Never had Wayne in my top 5 but I do love his punchlines and the fact it made people want to step it up.

3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 4 neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.--HOLY BIBLE

Goat 🐐
It fully sounds like yung thug smh
Back in the day, I used to send him two bars on Twitter. And the week or two later I noticed that it was rhyming with what I wrote. Went back and forth for like a month and a half. I don't even know if it was him Horsham marketing executive. But he seriously is one of the most influential artists working artists with an paralleled content. It's amazing to even have as much work as he has made to listen to. He's helped me make it through my brother's passing. My girl sams death. And a lot more. Love that his flow is still ridiculous, just glad that he still doing his thing.
Miss those truckfit days 🥲
cool man
I can’t stop listening to hit Wayne is the goat shout out to Rich the kid for the hit
Lil Wayne mumble rapping now... But I still love Lil Wayne 🥰
Love how everyone is on Lil Wayne's dick again after everyone disowned him back in 16 fake bandwagon fans

The Bible does say there are celebrations in heaven. There is rejoicing found in Luke 15:10, “In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”  When God called you home, it was time. It was not about our timing. If that were true, we would never have let you go. When God called you home, it was the right time. It was your time to be born in heaven.
Man told me ya think it's thou then there's Joe and he is where yo going with till )as tone my motarala Jun fact's all in view gas no wow well

🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Lil mix a song with method man and red man, take it old school my guy
I think the message is that no matter what you have become, you are still being treated as you were when you were younger.  You have changed, the streets that you grew up on have only gotten worse.  How can anything change if everything around the neighborhood you grew up in only gets worse?  Is this what we are talking about?  You are saying that it does not matter how much money that you have, people are still treating you as they did when you were a child.  Respectfully, Scott
I've been waiting for this. Continue the progression brahh
This was on my birthday 💯💯
This song isn't good imo ... rich the kid voice annoying af does he always sound like this
the diligence
Uyuyui Mom Rd
Uyuyui mamá Rd dura la diligencia
Being somebody who grew up on wayne I'm happy to see him still talking his shit
Tunechi ❤️🔥❤️forever
Wayne can literally adapt to any style of rap and put out better music than 99% of the industry
Aye Rich can now be addressed as Rich The Man interchangeably, and I can now be addressed as Tunechi Jr.

RICH THE WHO 😂
Wine gets better with time,  Wayne gets better with rhyme.

Wayne he is the best rapper alive
...anyone else hear Kodak Black Peachy in this beat?
#1Trend
So glad subtitles exist man
Tunechi is for life
Your soul rests with I
I like Lil Wayne don't get me wrong but is it just me or is he starting to look more and more like Whoopi Goldberg as time goes on?
Wattshomie Quan???
LETS GOOOOO. HEAT.
Wayne is a legend. But these new rappers must not care about rappin on beat or care about being understood. Mumble rap
I'm sorry I'm a long time lil wayne fan but he just needs to stop 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Wayne is the greatest plz give him his flowers plus I'm his biggest fan from SOUTH AFRICA S/O to my older brother for making me listen to his music.🔥🇿🇦💪
I see you Watts! That’s what’s up!
Amazing!!
Y’all know that Really happened in Real Life right ? 🔥😂 he really said that to on the deposition
Please tell me someone caught the lil dicky reference from Lil Wayne, the facial expressions were perfect
Why is lil Wayne doing a whole album with Rich The Kid? Like he doesn't even deserve 2 be on a song with Wayne let alone an album
Bangers only 🔥🔥🔥
🔝
Might be just me, but when weezy is with another trap artist his trap accent is HEAVY. Almost understandable. When with a lyrical musician, you can clearly understand him. Kind of frustrating because he actually writes GOOD lines
im very happy to see you a gaine wezzy
Wayne vs. The industry thats a match I wanna see
CASH MONEY REALLY SHOULD DO BALLER BLOCKIN 2 WHERE THEY ALL GET OUT OF JAIL AFTER  20 YRS !!!!!!!      THAT WOULD BE SUPERDOPE
The 🐐is always gone be the ♑️..💪🏾💯
WattsHomieQuan in the music vid yo haha

真好听nice
Lil Wayne shifted the rap after Jay z and Nas

Tunechi
I Been Feeling Like Tunchie
Man this shit so hard!!!
This IS Crack
OMG.  I Can't Stop laughing, and Watching
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Question why is it that a person of one race can make racial comments and it's ok but the other can't and it's viewed as racist? Is a racist comment not a racist comment no matter who makes it? But black "people"  can say honkey kracker  openly and freely but get mad if a white person says nigger? Then you say to end racism but are racists yourself! Also say want equality but truly don't care about equal rights for all only thereselfs. Do they fight for gay rights? No! Do they fight for Hispanic rights? No! Do they fight for immigration no just black lives matter! You can say black power and your not racist say white power and your racist when clearly they have the same meaning!
Wayne is just a freakin legend
Wayne been doing this over 25 years.. And still keeping up with the young bulls.. The reinventing flow..
5/10

Uzi zert looks like Wayne's younger twin brother
This nigga said hes got more babies than a pediatrician😭
Retrogression and the death of black music. The illuminati did an aggressive campaign until they succeeded in desensitizing the once genius tribes from the true definition of quality and decency
Crazy how wayne has been trending every year for 25 years😳
Wayne carried this shit I know his back hurt 😂
why nobody talking bout Rich the kid ?🙁 He understood the assignment 🔥🔥🔥
The real GOAT weezy 🐐🙏🏽🇷🇪
Wayne carried this track, a legend!!
LIL WAYNE RAISED ME
Wow weezy you're real talented Gift from God.👌👌👌
The guy from polo g's and king von's the coad
People always say….Biggie, Jay-Z and Nas. Don’t get me wrong they (were) hard for a time. Both Eminem & Wayne still making fire music to this day. If Wayne isn’t your favorite…he better be close. Nice work Mr. Carter! Been a fan since you were rocking at age 14 💪🏽
This is Trash it’s so hard to listen to just sounds like there screaming with auto tune on  just fucking rap

Why would Wayne make an album with Rich the kid? Makes absolutely no sense. He's gonna get bodied on every track.
KDoe and Tank “Play It Safe “ Out Now Tune In We The Next To Blow 📶📶
“OJ on this beat like it fit me(the glove)” 🔥🔥🔥omg

The real deposition is the funniest shit ever
🔥🔥🔥🇧🇷
Wayne never stop giving us dem bars. We talking bout over 2 decades
The video is Fire 🔥 but Wayne could have savaged this track but he Nibbled on it instead 😩... In my opinion on this particular track I still love Wayne tho but I know his lyrical content is way crazier and mind blowing than this pre K shit fr!!! He ain’t a 🐐 4Nonthin !!!🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹

Most of y’all seem to be Tunechi fans. A true Lil Wayne knows the difference and wouldn’t be impressed by this… Weezy used to murder every bar of every track he ever graced. No song off, no verse wasted.

Real OGs know about that interview 😂😅
Weezy the best rapper alive. I can't stand autotune so I really don't vibe to this heavy but it's undeniable how talented that man is. The bars have stayed amazing for 20 years.
Lil Wayne: “We stick to the code like Leo Da Vinci”     Leonardo Da Vinci: This confrère must have Hypersalivation the way he spitting! 🔥

The Best rapper alive Wezzy F Baby
Here...!!! Choose me and help me, please... take me with you 04/10/2021
That was my fav interview of all time 😂😂😂
Happy birthday weezy
Before you ignore this, remember that no one made it to the top without starting from the bottom.  For years I wanted to be a musician but fear always made me say "My time is too late, I missed my shot" At 26 I became fed up with the day to day, moved to rural japan 🎎🗻 and started putting out music. My grandfather passed away on Christmas Eve, which is why i've been really relentless. I know that it's the TIME to get moving ⏰!! So I made a CHILL Hiphop/Jazz song called 🌊"Tsunami" 🌊 that sampled a dope Japanese city pop artist Kikuchi Momoku's song. It feels extra special to create these songs, since I live in Japan!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mo4_rGCa_8
Hope the youngins here appreciate the 🐐
"is it true you performed with Willie Nelson at the Country music awards?"

I wish Rich had done the hook alone and Lil Wayne had done both versus. I would have gone straight to Spotify to add to my playlists but I just can't stand off beat rapping. Being on time, rhyme schemes, bars and flow are things I'm just not willing to let go.
Brings back the 2000s vibes damn I miss them days

Shout out to watts homie Quan
So many hated lil wayne but he's always been a goat and always will be
I told ya a long time ago, most of today’s hip hop is in direct result of what Wayne and Kanye  influenced in the 2010’s the fact that this man has seemingly stepped back into the spot light without sounding like he’s missed a beat is a testament to it.
Dam lil wayne going broke
Correction**** We all feelin like tunechi
He remade the legendary interview 😂😂😂Weezy a goat
High asl I just thought the music video should've been lil Wayne and Rich in different eras of Wayne just walking through old different music videos we'd all remember (Get Money, Lollipop,Bling, forever)
Lil Wayne special af. he know what he doing and he Doing it. Staying relevant and even spreading more bout he's personal battles.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
he back as fuck jesus christ they go need help
Wayne's been killing it from day 1. Love him
More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate.❤️
The deposition video should be in US history books

Yunk Vino
So Rich got Wayne, and Uzi got future i like it
Fallen angels arent aliens. Ishtar became a man for her father, god and jesus are one. Lucifer is catholic and false, satan is a tyrant and chose to be king of the gentilles. The great falling away has happened and the 144 are being sealed right now. Dont take the mark of the beast if they come for you, let them take you. Dont worship the statue. ✝ENERGIES NOT ALIENS✝
Weezy going for 30 years straight with some fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Ok Wayne
Hello everyone I just wanted to let you know that Jesus Christ loves you and He is waiting for you to repent and turn away from sin before it is too late, the wages of sin is death and you could die at any moment. God so loved the world He gave His only Son to suffer and die for us all to pay the price for our sins...I am warning you that if you refuse to accept Jesus Christ and that if you refuse to repent and turn away from evil to live for Him your destination will be hell. Wide is the road that leads to destruction but narrow is the way that leads to eternal life..please make the right decision because this life on earth is only temporary but eternity is forever. God bless you all.
muito foda esse sommmmmmmmmmm

Got me feeling like rich the kid w/ grown ass man money 💰
In this song (1:59sec)..show the word "BLING BLING" in the dictionary gave by lil Wayne the legend 🔥🔥🔥🔥
He birthed these Lil nyggaz
So. If you mention the greats of all time like pac, big, Jay, nas, jada, styles, cube, face, pun, rakim, krs, talib, mos def, black thought… I have to leave so many out but we could clearly go on. The point I’m making is that wet as supporters of this thing called rap music/hip hop have to acknowledge Wayne as one of those greats. Even if you not a big fan. Like Jay Z for example. I’m not a huge J fan but that don’t change the fact that he’s a major factor with that mic device.  Wayne is a major factor.  Oh and someone else I have to mention because niggaz be leavin him out is Fab.
Rich the kid all off beat
Lil Wayne will NEVER stop dropping 🔥🔥🔥 🐐💯

Dear friends, please know that Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior, is The WAY, The TRUTH, and The LIFE! He loves you so much. The greatest decision you will EVER make is welcoming Jesus Christ into your life right now!! Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord of your life. Believe in His death on the cross, burial and resurrection for the sins of all human-kind and you will be saved.                               In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, may Father God, our Creator bless you in the Glorious name of His Son, Jesus Chris our Lord and Savior. 🙏❤️

That wall with tuniche’s songs and albums is such an iconic frame. How to Love, tha Carter, Believe Me, Krazy, Hustler Musik, Love Me, Mirror… so many memories Wayne has defeated time
Everybody knows that Lil wayne is making everybody's day better with his music
Fact: Everybody knows that Lil wayne is making everybody's day better with his songs.
It's like wayne's flow was prepared for this generation of rap 20 plus years ago he was just relaxing giving these new rappers a shot at the game

Undisputed weezy❤️🎧
Loved how Wayne flipped his 2012 deposition. That was a certified hood classic
the interrogation scene got me dying 😆 throwback
Just realized that teenagers these days barely know who Lil Wayne is
Weezy bring out the best in rich

They skate together. I'm sure they are close. I'm not surprised by the joint album. Just crazy cause rich the kid fuckin can't rap. And lil wayne is "best rapper alive" so idk.. Hopefully the album will still vibe. I'm sure wayne dumbed his shit down for it though. 🙄
Wayne I’m trying to meet you bro
I ain’t really feeling this album it’s rich the kid for me 🤦🏽‍♂️
Nobody talks about how good rich the kid actually is on this shit
“OJ on the beat cause it fit me” 🤧🐐
nobody does it like Lil Wayne does it 🖤💯 he always on top🔥
Before y’all write the album off, you have to go listen to headlock on it 🔥😤🐐
Cooler then a bitch -gunna  is so similar
Got my feel like TC electronic communications trends

That reenactment was a bit cringy tho
Rich really up there
Wayne’s as big if not bigger than any Artist from any generation… And we should all show this man love for his life made our lives better.. 💐💐💐🐐🐐

Tunech walk in a session don't know tha beat, nothin. He gets behind the mic says turn that shit up and hit record,  no cap. He can freestyle 4 sho, not while looking at his phone like erybody else do.

It’s time to stop winning and repent. Accept Jesus into your life while you still can! Those without Jesus can never go to heaven. For the wages of sin is death. Sin leads to death. You must be holy otherwise eternal suffering, torment, pure chaos will happen in the afterlife. Don’t wait another day! Tomorrow is never promised! After death is judgement! ☁️ 🔥 your choice!
Joyner Lucas really set the trend when he did "Will" and the "give them their flowers" movement.. Kodak Black did "too boosie" now "feelin like tunechi" 💯.. Respect
Watts homie I see you fam!!!!!!
uht o..weezys back!!!!!!!!!!!!!

😵‍💫🔥🔥🔥🔥
i feel like rich the kid with grown man money!! ight thats intelligence in word play. lets step this shit up!
WOOOOOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯🇨🇮
I've been fucking with Wayne since the 90's,and always will. But I have to be honest with criticism..he needs to go back to what made him successful..bars. He is one of the best rappers ever and I feel he wastes it on this auto tuned out shit. Carter V was a dope album,everything he done since I'm not a big fan of. And honestly the numbers are worse to,185K views in half a day isn't the best considering it's Wayne.
https://youtu.be/9ReNfWKJCPg
🔥🔥😎
I like how Rich got on the Old Wayne Fits on 🔥🔥 Iconic 🐐 and ofc Wayne did this thang 💯
This was real good. Nice work Wayne.
WOW SO 2021
Someone tell me where to get trukfit from
I love lil wayne voice.but without auto tune😏❤️
With all dew respect to little Wayne . Please do something with your hair fam

It's like wayne's flow was prepared for this generation of rap 20 plus years ago he was just relaxing giving these new rappers a shot at the game
