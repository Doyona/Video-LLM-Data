I don't blame her
That women's got every right...
Lol this is why he sleeping on da yard
Her braids look cool though
I like her😂
You guys did good in the sense you thought it out and didn't bite someone else but you need a little more effort.  The extremely low effort makes people want to talk about that rather than the sketch.   Otherwise good job and thank you for not relying on filters
That’s pretty low man.
Shit sorry I had the munchies... my bad I seen  you were  preparing for the last supper I thought I had some time hahah 😜🤫 you know she's just cooking a TV dinner 😂😂😂 yum-yum

It's best to be patient for your woman to make a well made male so don't order anything just hide snacks in your office.
😂😂😂😭
What's the snap bro
I do the same thing as this guy in order doordash 🤣👍
Yoo thats sad man get yourself a new girl 🤦‍♂️🤣🤣

You could hear the emptnes of the box when she hits it. But none the less still very funny.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why are you so mean to her
Priceless !!
First off that box was empty, and there was no dishes food anywhere to be found. Who actually believes these dumb videos?
Empty or not that was cute her expressions 👄
Blondes at their finest.... come on bro at least she's trying
That box was empty
Okay who's the genius delivering empty boxes and leaving them on the ground at your front door "trick or treat" head as lmaoo
You are going to die boy.
a man's gotta eat...before he wastes away!!! hahahaha
Throw that food away if it takes 2 hours on 30min food run away
🤣🤣🤣🤩
Fellas, DO NOT ATTEMPT. I did. Ended badly.
His tomb stone says , I am a dumbass. " Lol 🤣. Just kidding.  RIP 😁 dude
There are always going to be a-holes
That was a nice pizza box, and she just dropped it out your hands like that
Hahahaha 😀👠
This cracks me up because the only thing my wife can cook is microwavable things and Im certified cook she tried to order out every night just so I don't show out hahaha
👍🤣
😂😂😂these are greAt. You’re so mean dude haha
Wow,.. she  just started to learn how to cooking,... 🍕,.. 😆
She's going to put a beating on him
Hahaha 🤣
Lucky it was an empty box. 😀😀
🤣🤣🤣
Probably set up seems so fake
Lol
Bro... You just got banished to the couch, if you're lucky, or the literal dog house!
😂😂🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆
Yep, this guy lost his balls a little aftwr 3am
Definitely, true man, it happens to me many times ☹
That's so funny but messed up at the same time
She's cute
That look is the calm before the storm Then you die lol
Don't need to turn the stove on to make sandwiches!
The empty box looked full of pizza 🍕 😋 and she wasn't having it. She looked pretty upset 😡 😢.
Well that was going to happen.
Vc vai dormir no sofá hoje, pelo visto.
😂😂😂
Pls don't do that maan... 😂😂😂
Well rehearsed! It's scripted. Totally fake. If she would be cooking 🍳 for two hours there would be a huge mess on the countertops  she's a YouTube star. That's how they make money 💰 for a living. Look closely and you can tell that the countertops are clean.
I love the reaction... I understand it well as I myself being a male cook too n, she ate potato chips...
It's like a slap in the face I think he deserves one So Babe give him one
A lot of their shorts are faked it’s just made to show funny things that usually actually happen but they exaggerate it a little. And they don’t try to hide it cause I don’t think they want to have just super fake content. Like on that one vid when he saw the pregnancy test and said he was gonna go buy some milk cause they ran out. It’s just to be funny
Lmao
The guy must own the 'za shop. Obvious product placement is Obvious
U ruined her life lik
Poor my beautiful girl 😞🤗🤗🤗
Run!!!
Fake!
Oh uh
Lou Malnati's Pizza ...  You're in Chicagoland.
😂😁🤣
Haha i want to do this everytime my girl cooks. I finally told her the other day to just stop ill cook from now on
Should’ve had it ready before he got home
She did it right
I loved this lolololololol dead man sleeping.
Know the feeling dude when my wife cooks same thing never know how dinner is going to turn out worst of all I do the dishes so I hate when I get a crap meal and I have to clean up , I wish I would of order out
You're done!!!
Fake Empty box
😀😂
Dead man walking lmfao
Not happy 😳😂🤣😂
The Pizza box sounds empty
That's the psycho killer look lmao
Of course, we know what his answer is if she offered him a piece.
she be heating up the frozen costco pizza but cant figure out the oven 😅
Bro the death stare she gave you 😭😭
Yea i have to agree thats cruel
I'm predicting an untimely death in the family, The 'accident' occurred when a pizza box was forced into the wrong orifice and traveled the wrong way through his digestive tract, causing severe internal trauma. Surprisingly, she looked quite pleased as she was placed in the Police car - laughing and waving as the coroner's vehicle carried his lifeless body away.
Just tell her she doesn't know when and how to cook
Get her an easy bake. Gotta start somewhere
Box was empty as fuck.
Lol! Funny! Click on Da Bird and see where he takes you!
Fake Scripted time waster video 👎
When she’s been cocking for over 2 hours🤣
Team no simpin 🎤😏👍
Nice One
That kitchen way too Clean
Everyone needs to chill it’s a joke
It's weird how this is made up just for entertainment purposes. I'm old.
YO Oh that hit 😆
😂😂🤣
Only a woman could get away with slapping that box out of his hand, not the other way around
Rightfully so, i have been cooking and slavining in kitchin and you go and get a 🍕 pizza.
Maybe go give her a hand?? Just saying
😂😂😂
That was mean
No the box wasnt empty I swear. It was full of air.......
Ummm..she was THAWING for over 2 hours..the "cooking" involves ingredients, various containers, the stove being actively under power while producing heat, along w/ other activities, none of which are seen here..LoL...Poor Her!! But hey..she's fashion savvy, knows how to apply her makeup well, and just looks bangin'. I could sacrifice and order take out  every night for this "curse"..I'd feel "BLESSED"..
Good skit. I could understand the response with Domino’s or Papa Johns, but Lou’s??  Come on. 🤣
What the problem is
That is such a stupid joke. Who ever  made this is absolutely sexist asf and completely rude and I'm a guy
Holy crap! Lou Malnati’s!!! I visited Naperville for the first time ever last summer. And, that’s the first place I ate.
meannie
Yeet
Poor baby
Probably a TV dinner in the micro.
Ahahaa aww Cutest Reaction Ever Lol
What did you expect handing her an empty box
It doesn't matter how big the steak is, Lou Malnati's wins every time
When hes out of breath from walking to the front door.
#Rest in peace bro 😌✌️
Awww...poor lady 😊 love your place !
She ain't got no right to complain no meal for 2 should be taking 2+ hours to make Wtf she got a whole turkey in there?
To be fair it was over 2 hours

This fake content gets old. Whatever gets clicks I guess.
So. You've chosen death then...
That pizza box was so much full of AIR.
😆😂🤣
Well I thinking she was only boiling water Coz I can see any sign of cooking
That's hilarious

What woman cooks for 2 hours?
She is adorable 😍
If you don't want her let her be happy with another man.
Fake AF
😁😂😂😂😂👍
It was supposed to be a short Sci-Fi wort Dust film? 🤯
Can’t really say I to Lou! 🤣
People are just not trying anymore... too many fake vids.
This is what happens just before you are single
How do you not know how to use an oven its like my mom not knowing how to operate a tv
When she been cooking for more that two hours. I be taping that a quickie in Kitchen Yeah!
I would have waited ✋ and asked for seconds...
Either your desperate for views or a bad husband
You guys really put your life in your hands. 🤭🤭🤭
Empty box, clean unused kitchen, shitty sketch. Yepp tik tok America.
Wow  https://youtube.com/watch?v=dCtjjnnTLi4&feature=share
Yeah fake is not funny to me unfortunately, I would probably be constantly laughing if it was.
Lammme try harder next time
It's obvious by the sound the slap made to realize the box was empty. You guys are really bad at this. Not surprised though, seeing how this generation is simply incompetent.
RTFLMAO!!! I see divorce court in his future, RTFLMAO
That pause of silence at the end.But,I don't blame him.
Lolololololololol, priceless ! 😍
And THAT is what she brings to the table...
That is just being an A hole 😂.
Poor Girl
Who cares about how fake the sketch was she cute asf though 🤷🏾‍♂️🥰
These videos are actually horrible
Had that bull s.it happen for real
Not real but fantastic point
That box empty AF!😂
After feeling guilty, the next day he waited 2 hours, took a bite of her food, then called to order pizza.
🤣🤣cutest reaction 👍❤️
I know it’s a joke but if she was cooking for 2 hours the kitchen would not look like that.
It was empty lol
You r the funniest
You guys are scripted. That box was empty
wait this is a good idea
If this is true you are a really sad man…
Get your shit together....when your hungry your hungry!
Yep he probably just pulled that out of his dumpster and acted like it was delivered. Dislike and reported for misleading viewers.
She is soooooo adorable
When this is fake...... empty pizza box
That poor girl smh she dosen't deserve that.
Damn no booger tonight
Was I supposed to laugh?
Empty pizza box says it all.
Empty box and never set up
Maybe ask if she needs help?
Took 2 hours to learn how to work the microwave maybe
Dude, you lost the last opportunity
Looks like side is sleeping on the couch to nite
I figured it was an empty box, but her reaction was hilarious
Try being more realistic.
Is anything real on social media?
What cooking?? Two hours of staring at the wall more like it
Ever since he is missing 😂
It's an empty box, if you're gonna make a fake video at least make a good one...
Could of put something in the box and put some dirty pots or pans to make this at least 5% believable. Try harder next time.
Awww that is cruel thought. 😟
I saw the peanut butter move… She definitely can make a good sandwich… If it’s in two hours.😭
Lol....funny.
Fake as fuck. No dishes. Not even pizza in box. Yt has gone to literal trash
Fucking world were everything is fake for the sake of views...
He was a brave man
Its empty
She was very angry next time to learn to cook faster and better   Greetings from a Cook/Chef from Bavaria
Who cooks for two hours and still needs to use the oven? Fake as short…..
Empty ass box
😂😂😂😂
i love how little effort was put into making this convincing. no shit in the kitchen, pressing random ass buttons, using an obviously empty pizza box. the only way this could have been less effort is if kenzie wasn't even in the kitchen at all
Rip
Just stop with the fake shit.
The box was empty hahahaha
I always forget how much I loved staged obviously fake videos!!
I haaaate your shorts
Lou Malnati's is awesome, though...
You have gf who can cook? 😳
OMG its fake

What microwave dish takes two hours?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I mean good one man! But clearly the box has been delivered empty. I feel bad for the pizza delivery guy.

Stop whining about your girlfriend and let her find someone better. Shouldn't be too hard
Youre a deadman look. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I liked this
Would have ordered an empty pizza box too seeing as she was cooking air for 2 hours
Why was there an empty pizza box on your doormat?
I'm wondering why there are so many fake videos... 🤔
Now that is messed up bro LOL
Then what did she cook...2 hours😒
My girlfriend exactly the same!! 😂🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Starting to wonder if there’s any genuine prank videos out there nowadays. Hide the camera for christ sake.
As a long time pizza guy..I know an empty box when I see one.
The staging in your videos is too obvious, cringe
Amazing place hope someday I can achieve and get me a house
Cringe and staged
It was empty
The modern woman couldn't handle living in the early nineteenth century. Everything was made from scratch, cooked in a wood burning stove, etc. Back in the day "women's work" was hard, very hard
fake fucking world .. holyy
Somebody needs a kitchen makeover
There is no excuse for domestic violence !!! 😂
🤣🤣🤣
Empty box
Fake
Que falta de consideração!! Credo!😕
Someone didn't get no action that night!                       😳 .. 😆
I know her she went to western
You need to put something in the box next time so it doesn't make that Hollow thump when it hits the floor at least try to be a little realistic
These are fake as fk
She has been missing ever since.  I know bad joke my bad
Fake but still funny
What has she actually been cooking for 2 hours? Invisible spaghetti?
Imagine moving in with someone and they don't even know how to work the oven
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Being fake is the new trend?
🤣🤣🤣🤣 something I’d do
That was priceless 🤣,  my girl is Hispanic and I couldn't possibly imagine what all she would do
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That kitchen is way to clean to be cooking for two hours. She is just toasting bread and melting butter in the microwave for her toast.
This acting is so bad they are surely next to star in the expendables movie.
I’m an expert at slamming pizza boxes out of peoples hands that box was 100% empty
How could u do that to ur wife,,aahh coo,ing for two hrs and u show no vibe for her food,,thats crazy..disrespect
cringe has destroyed the internet
Might've pulled it off had their been actual evidence of cooking. And let's not forget the empty pizza box 😆
These videos get worse and worse
Messed up
My favourite line is saying to a woman ---> "Haven't you been told yet today?", pause for dramatic effect --> "How awesome you are!"...🙈🙉🙊 Feel free to borrow and skit....
That's disrespectful...to the pizza lol
Fake for views, time waster, click bait
Appetizhuuurrrzzhh
She's been cooking for over two hours , surley the egg is boiled by now.
Youtubers and "content extractors" don't cook.
Well that is not good boy
What's that little ass pizza gonna do, a grown man need a full size to get full.
Bro don't do that stuff I used the same technique on my gf,now I miss a arm and leg 🙂🙂👍😭😭... Oh sry I don't have a gf ... 🙂🙂🙂
At least put a book in the box to mask the sound
Fakkeeeeeeee
I'd order one to if that's all the food she had dun in 2 hrs.
If this were to really happen,  that box would be that dudes last meal, and I don't just mean the one she's gonna make for him.
Bro ...how are you now?
Online tell u how Dahhhh
She ain’t been cooking two hours cause the kitchens to dam clean.
Clearly staged as it’s an empty pizza box - click bait rubbish 😡

The pizza box is empty. Arranged situation. Poorly :/
He ain't getting desert tonight
Empty box

https://youtu.be/lPI4rcEjsBA
The sound of the box being hit tells that it’s empty
Lou Malnati has goooood pizza !!!!👍👍👍
The box wouldn't have sounded this empty if you could have kept a little piece of your brain in it.
The box was empty
Why go outside to get the empty pizza box you may as well just have it to hand
No No No No No! You didn't LOL
😲😬😃😅😂🤣
And the best actor award goes to.......
Empty ass box smh
Nice spike.. You shall be a worthy teammate to Kageyama
Imagine been as pathetic as either one of these two people. If they don't make you feel good about your own life, then nothing will.
The fact that she was working so hard and that’s all the payback u can give her
Lol, that was good even though, it's scripted & it's funnier when he offers it to her & she knocks it out of his hands, lol, I love this couple!!!!  Keep entertaining us & enjoying life!!!!
That would get me the night in the spare bedroom
As someone who enjoys cooking and especially cooking for others; this is an insult that goes far beyond words.
When I spend hours on a meal made from scratch and she smothers it in ketchup and ranch.
Yea sure...if it was real you'd be wearing that box 📦
Bunch of fake shit right here
Nice empty box
That box was empty, listen to the sound when it hits the floor
Come on guys it's obviously a joke
Have all these kitchen stuff yet you can't use it 🤨
But it's not even funny if this were real, a great way to get your balls cut off in the middle of the night tho!
You're going to sleep on the couch
You should be nice to your daughter. If thats not your daughter your going to jail for being a molester. If your both are young and living in daddys house grow the fuck up.
help her
Jake, you fell off
Women these days don't know how to cook a meal... lol... I gain about 60lbs from my wife fast and easy to make meals and she would take hours cooking it. I finally decided to make my own meal and regain my health. I took charge of my own health. I've lost weight, I feel better and I cook way better meals than those easy recipes she makes
It has happened to me ... I've cooked and by the time I'm done I'm not even hungry anymore ... just upset and annoyed at myself
Bruh don't 🧢 the box is empty
lol people are so slow pointing put it is staged when it is obvious and dodnt even matter to be funny which is the point...so empty lifes.
He loves testing their relationship.
Lmao my wife knows thats something I would do to mess with her.
😂🤣😂🤣
It's an empty box.  Stop making fake relationship videos you frauds.
Why are staged videos getting more and more popular.
Your DEAD!!!!!
The hollow sound of a box hitting the floor.
Out of all of this, there was only ONE seasoning bottle out🤒🤣🤣🤣
Hi

Yall gotta appreciate the joke, it had the heart, just not the backbone.     Jokes aside, it's funny.
I mean dude couldve helped?
People believe this lol
That dude having more viewers because of his cute gf
Look empty Box
Yes I realize the kitchen is to clean and the box was empty!!   It's the underlying thought process behind the video that's pure cold core rotten. I'd be embarrassed if someone knew I played it out my girlfriend. I really would!! Sad thing is there's 10k thumbs up.  Wow 😣
I would’ve started two hours prior to him getting off😩
‘Twas empty
*slaps the clearly empty box*
Are you stil alive?

Somebody's not getting any tonight!
That box is empty AF
She cook  too long 😩
The video is rubbish but the girl is super cute.
Wish I could cook for two hours and kitchen be that clean
Sound empty
Lol
Ahhh the sound of an empty box.
If real - not funny.  If real - she started cheating on you the day after.
White Drama
yeah this was excessively fake
What is she cooking? Imaginary food like in "Hook"?
Bad ending: "She put a knife, and become yandere".
Wow you need to sleep with one eye open, you gonna die dude 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Box is empty

Stop the world. I want off
It's probably fake, but still amusing 😃👍
Fully fake is what I can tell
I fear for you’re life brother lol
The emptyest pizza in the world
I Shaw the box and I started laughing 🤣🤣🤣👌
That was just mean, she didn't deserve it, but you did.
Lmfao
This is the beginning of a ID episode
Box sounded empty af
Shannon should have been learning how to cook instead of going to all those keggers
Empty box
The box is empty
Some people do wayyy too much. These people do the perfect amount 👌
LMAO
Dislike
I've done that
I'm a fat ass, so I know the sound of an empty pizza box when I chuck it across my man cave.
Oh, and she is barefoot..
There wasn’t one dirty dish one seasoning flour sugar nothing come on
RIP
Such bullshit.  Cooking for two hours in a spotless kitchen? Everyone wants their 15 seconds of T.T. fane...... Losers.  And to cheap to actually buy a hot pizza for your "skit"?  DOUBLE FAIL.
The hollow sound of that pizza box
Nice skit. Empty box no receipt.🤣
"NO! And you're not getting any of me!"
If you guys havent realised it yet this girl literally is in a "relationship" with a bunch of tiktokers and viners and they fake all this shit to gain popularity.  It's all staged. Still funny but staged.
Kids not knowing how to cook and no idea what 2 hours looks like, then gets a friend to ring the doorbell and leave an empty box.......quality viewing 🤔
That box is empty
Lol looks like she's pre heating the oven.
She gave him the death stare 💀 🤣
2 hr cooked meal is a well made meal
Two hours to bake roman noodles. I bet that pizza was good tho. (Its empty because he ate it all. Salt on the wound, offers a piece even tho she seen you eat it all.)
Millennials can’t cook.  She’s tryin to learn how to use the stove to warm up pop tarts.  She ordered the pie and is mad he ate it all.  She’s starving and frustrated at her inability to use a stove.
Yeah..staged empty box..empty head.
See, not just anyone can pull off this kind of sketch.
If this is real, you marriage will not last long... Why dont you help? I work hard all day, my wife is back at school, I take care of the kids and everything in the house... The least you should do is find a youtube video to help her with the oven. Or easy receipe, cook with her
Not Funny at all
Empty box. Fake
Happy wife happy life!
Fake..
That box was empty
Guess her food is awful. 😂🤣😂🤣
The exact happened to me..coming home from work starving like Marvin...😎
100% that box sounded empty
Bruh
Empty box
You can tell that's an empty box
People are way too desperate to go viral
Acting kills bruh
So fake.. Get a job guys
I don't blame the dude
That would be the last meal she cooks for you. These fake videos will ruin short videos.
Over 2hrs!!!? Hell no I'm making a sandwich right next to her like oh that looks like a delicious breakfast 🤣
I’m dead 🤣😂🤣
That box was empty. Good prank on the lil lady though.
Lol 😁
😏🤣👍
She's gorgeous mad lol
So fake
If you’re gonna fake it at least put something in the box.
The lies people want to live. Nobodies in nowhere land.
I am such a happy man becauae my girl learned to cook from her grandmother. Her dishes are divine. Better than ordering food. There arent many girls these days that know how to cook a proper meal.
That's a no no 😂😂
99 percent of videos these days are fake... yet ppl still watch them.
A kitchen doesn't look like that when someone has been cooking for over 2 hours.
Waste my time
lol stop saying its fake we all know that. They're probably just trying to be funny or recreating a funny memory. Enjoy the content or just keep scrolling.
No pots or pans, or actual food being cooked.
She's So CUTE!!!!
I want to respect her
Guess she should get some practice in, and hurry up next time
It was empty. Fake ass shit
You should have offerred to help with cooking.
Seems you have a broken woman.  Time for a new one
Lame
She very frisky cat . 🐈
Really wyd she been cooking for 2 hrs frozen burritos lol
Pfffffff ha
Putting Lou’s on the ground.. is just Blasphemy!!
That’s some shit that will get you in trouble
These fake Tiktoks are starting to really annoy me lol.
Fake videos.  💩
Do these people ever do anything real?
What was she using to cook?? That’s some talent
No evidence of cooking , empty pizza box yup yup .
😂😂😂
XD the best Xd
LOL!!
Low grade effort
Ayyye that's that good good pizza!
Even tho it's fake ,I love her braids 😍
Y’all don’t deserve a comment because of the empty box
Lou's is the best...
Show her some love instead, man.
She's like I ain't eating that I was cooking
The funny part is that I see this stuff bcos to not feel that lonely
Empty box
I would of just picked her up to sit her on the edge of the counter and looked her in eyes and said look I need a little snack 😜👍
That pizza box was empty like shit!!!
Stop hating it's still entertainment
Box is nice and empty so she has no real malady
Thats a voice of a dead man
Atleast make it believable. Have ingredients and plates out. Not getting famous with an empty box.
That pizza box is empty , also no pizza delivery guy puts your food on the floor . Real fake
This video isn’t even slightly believable.
Love having empty boxes delivered to my house
I know that’s right 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This just stinks of desperation...
Bearssss
Lolololololol Lololol lolololololol
Wow  (Might wanna take Some snack before Reading the rest😉) Everyone hating because it doesn’t actually say that this is a setup.. Would you rather have Netflix shows wear a sign from beginning till end saying it is actually scripted and that dragons, vampiers, wherewolves, timetravelers, ghosts and everything else like this don’t actually exist? If the answer is no stop complaing, because most people can figure out this is a setup. You’re not helping those who already know.. You’re just ruining a laugh.  Disclaimer: This is not meant for those who are not hating on video’s like this because you thought this was real at first and someone ruined it for you.. this is meant for that someone.😉 Also i know (for those Jokers out here) that there are exceptions On the things not existing.. like dragons You might not see dragons flying in the real world (so not talking about Game of Thrones or Skyrim), unless you have enough imagination skills ofcourse👌 But commodo dragons do exist.. and so do snakes. Also ghost might not exist like you’re thinking about them right now.. but they do exist in Special Ops. And so on and on. Also i’m not particulairly defending this clown.. I’m just sick and tired of all those people sending hate in video’s like this. Have a Nice one💪
The box was empty that cap smfh
It was empty lol
Y'all be lying non stop on your channel and it's weird
Not sure how this is funny.
What delivery people leave a hot pizza on a front porch with snow. Fake as hell
That is fucked I!
Fake AF !!!! Like come on my guy at least try and buy a cheap pizza !!
Hay Gary Winthrop. Shes got a verginty rocks shirt on .
You could have made it more believable if you put something in the box
BWAHAAHAHAAA
Well at least she hit the box instead of you
Lou Malnatis is 🔥
She looks like my ex.
Empty box?
First,  and there's nothing in the box
