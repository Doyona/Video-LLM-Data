thank you for all the kind comments :) I will do my best to take full advantage of this time off so I can come back fully energized to make the best content I can!
4:47 perfect time to do the brand deal...
They look ok but what we got is so much better. 17:35
Pokemon meme review more like doctor eye review
2:01 don’t you mean 50 because it’s not 100% it’s 50%
4:07 Correction - sexy people
My first shiny was a pigpig
Lechonkyboi
Wait splonk dies when not bouncing?
Michael I am in danger 0:42
10:38  im team left it has Froakie and treecko
Pigpig, the pig pokemon. This Pokemon is a pig. Moves: Pig Move and Sniff
6:15 OH NO HE'S HOT-
*gasps* an ad I didn't skip, that's a 1st
10:35 both
Girls dont watch😂😂😂
Orcane change it to orfang
The amount of confidence this probably needed reaches the milkyway 6:18
I love whenever grunty boi is mentions he pops up
I mean, if it’s not 100% accurate, it’s 50% accurate.
6:26  …
1:52 No, it’s not 33%. It’s 50%.  “If it’s not a 100% accurate, it’s 50% accurate”
Hi Mandjtv, this was recorded on my birthday in 2022, that made the video more amazing
Are we going to talk about how Mikey predicted 3 new Pokémon 1. Ice type leopard 2. Chili 3. Dark type moose
17:36 I feel like every Pokémon here needs to stay bipedal because of there previous evolutions they look amazing but they make more sense bipedal
10:37 Blue and it's not even close, Froakie is the only thing I'd be missing out on compared to all my other favorites.
grunty boy did it again
sorry do you mean 50% accurate banner?
Loves how grunty boi basically appears every time a meme of him appears
with its nactrul ingreadnts
grunty Boi showering porn... I won't complain but if the hub theme popped up I wouldnt blink
I don't think you could take off the hat.I think it's good to his head 6:21
“33% accuracy” so it’s 50%
Bro cant keep showering on video like this 😂
Lechonk Piglet in Spanish is lechon  Pigs at are usually very big Another word for that is chonk That + expert marketing You get this beautiful little boi
6:17 thank you very much for this segment.
Cool I was born in 2013
10:23 You can get one in real life!
I found a shiny septile and a fletchling
I love how multiple of the designs MandJTV made actually turned into predictions, I mean we got  A Dark Type Moose Pokemon in Ting-Lu  A Snow Leopard pokemon in Chien Pao  A Hot Pepper Pokemon that is Fire/Grass with Scovillain
5:20 what
"So that is 33% accuracy great on that." If it's not 100%, it's 50% meaning he got 50% of tlhe banner correct
Orpain
Cosmoth is the name of a fusion between Cosmog and Frosmoth
What is the video of grunty boi using dr squatch
I found the video!
Who else wants some doctor squatch
AHH! MY INNOCENCE!!
10:50 a platypus Pokémon?  *GASP PERRY THE PLATAPUS POKÉMON!
Iif its not 100% accurate  its 50%accurate
I used to Skip the Grunty Boy scenes as a kid because I wanted to see the video, now I appreciate them
5:23 💀💀💀
Um kakui is a teacher anime people
12:12 It's using a battery as its skeleton? 😕
At 10:39 As someone who's top three favorite starters are Charmander, cyndaquil, and mudkip, I see this as an absolute win.
6:15 for people who are trying to find it
Why do people not like Charizard?
Micheal I am afraid I cannot buy ur hoodie because I am much much stupider than you
Imagine: Lechonkachu
10:37 the blue pill because it has snivey,cydaquill, AND mudkip
👾
1:51 Mikey: "Its 33 % accurate." If it's not a hundred percent accurate its 50 percent accurate
after watching this a few times since its drop I do have to remind everyone that in red and blue as well as Yellow you didn't get running shoes at all. Gen 1 was slow because we were all restricted to walking everywhere.
Wait a minute... If that banner isnt a hundred percent accurate... ITS 50 PERCENT ACCURATE
“Welcome to the newest episode in ask peter pie!”
18:58 I need this as a regional cast for  Game freak: we’ll we can’t do that  Me: I need it
here from one and a half years in the fUtUrE, dude you *STILL* need to update that reddit banner
0:21 is it me or did I see green liquid on the paper towel or whatever it was
I swear somehow all these “characters” are just John from Alternate timelines.
Skill issue
I miss the gamer goggles:’(
Wait team skull is a group of a bunch of kids, and team rocket is filled with people probably 18-50 HOW IS GRUNTY BOI DATING A TEAM SKULL MEMBER
1:58 it's actually 50% accurate  Because if it's not 100% accurate it's 50% accurate
2:00 just so you remember, if it’s not 100% accurate then it’s 50% accurate
10:37 the left has Froakie, Tepig, Treecko
I’m subbed please give me a shoutout plz plz plz plz
Grunty Boy is the only person who can make me watch sponsorships
I was on the buss watching this, a lady was watching over my shoulder when the shower montage came on lol, I was so embarrassed I wanted to cry, love this vid tho 🫶
I thought he was going to say he was going to quit
Grunty Boi showering with his hat on will never stop amusing me
11:41 i think I prefer the second image
What if the orca pokémon was called Orkill? It’s a bit on the nose, but it’s cool.
Why does sobble go from a crybaby little kid to an emo lizard to a fucking secret agent
Not the hat
19:17 something about the pose makes me think of Joanna from the rescuers down under, am I the only one that sees that?
10:34 Grabs both of the red and blue pills and downs both of them because there isn’t a rule that says you can’t take both😝
Lechonk comes from two words, lechon : a food made of pork and , chonk because it is cute and chonky ❤
Why grunty boi kinda 🫣
Cool thing is, Mikey-- that banner is actually 50% accurate
The good part is at 6:18
I like intelon's default form
2:56 Heh. Pssshhhhhh, nooo. That would be _cuh-razay._
Lechoonkyboi
Red side
I am giving my gliscor guilltine
When i see doomoose in the wild Michael jordan "koby" with an ultra ball
ah yes, Dr. squatch's hat shampoo and conditioner.
3:51 what if Charizard…WAS the legendary???
0:10 finish him
Mikey: I would Never! Film     Myself In The shower! Meanwhile grunty boi: 🛀
SECOND SHOWER MONTAGE
New catchphrase unlocked: Cowabummer
How about orbrute
I feel like drowzee is jelly
Ha ha! 😂
And why sexy shower montage 🤷🏼
When grunty boi rubbed his armpit I knew the sponsor was dr squatch no idea why 😅
Sorry so late but me subscribe and I absolutely agree with professor sada
man the old roblox death sound lol
17:33 ok game freak making Intellion stand up on 2 legs was the right call those legs don't look right🥶
Cowabummer is sending me
Mikey for a french as me I think you have a great french accent
bro horny frog pokemon for dartoad
Orgone is a good name
We don’t talk about the dr scuatch in the bush
They added a platypus pokemon in gen 1. Psyduck is actually mostly based on platypuses, which is pretty cool.
1:59 "That's only a 33% accuracy grade on that..." Don't you mean....        50% accurate?
2:59 you know that definitely would be cool💀
Flopflap: Team sky's new mascot
0:01 proof buying his hoodie hurts your eye
6:17 i want this to be an ad for dr squatch or any soap advertisement HAHHAHAAH
Uhm actually a poison dart frog can kill a elephant with only just one touch!
I saw The exact same Kermit meme on pintrest earlier today
Your subreddit banner is 33% accurate which means it’s 50% accurate
fans: more sexy shower vids pls
The intro with me feel pain along with him*Sniffs*
Maybe Orcane’s new name could be something like “Orcarate” (Orca + Karate)
we just ganna skip over the fact grunty boy still wears his hat in the shower
Merch drop, me, “MandJTeeV”
What even hit him in the intro
8:12  Sorry let me just take a screenshot with my arsphone
lets be honest, platypuses are weirxd enough just as they are they could be a pokemon
I wanna see some pigpig art
Castform is popular. Just not in a good way sadly
Did that sponser just give me grunts boi shower content?
Sun/moon series characters have Brains I can't see with a microscope
Talking about when Mikey found a random shiny in sword and shield without intentional hunting i caught an awesome toxel shiny randomly and not intentionally,YAY
your explaination is not what a sabattical ist. During a sabattical a professor or scientist or something takes a "vacation" to work somewhere else maybe not full time, but it's nut just a long vacation.
6:17 ...I got the wierdest boner of my life..
Somebody play the shower with grunti boi with a drowsey
at 2:58 the prediction came true
I have to say since you mentioned a semester, the videos with John really helped me get through my exam period and whenever I felt burnt out from hours of reading, I was watching your videos to relax. It really helped
It’s concerning how grunty boi likes dr squatch more than team rocket itself
Lechonk go Bonk
I only was able to fall asleep for like an hour I read and watch do you guys for a good chunk of it
ManDJTV
All hail team sky
This video made me sure I was Bisexual
This vid suggested a vid of mine
Orcannon
Its funny to me that you can't justify pokemon not dying in battle by saying they just faint when fainting spoink is basically murdering it.
Why are most of mikeys pokemon in gen 9? XD
WHY IS MIKEY SMELLING GRINTY BOI
Bro Mike’s got real. I just wanted wanted to see lechonk
Tbh these fan arts are better than a lot of the new gen 9 Pokémon
I think you should name your orca pokemon Shadorca
I take both teams for starters
Everyone sub he’s almost at 2M subs
10:35  blue pill
If your a work horse then your a WEESNAR
How about you stop pretending to be grunty boi
The Pokémon you made were re made by a youtuber
Blue
What are these sponsorships 😂😂😂
can we talk about how a lot of the fakemon are close to real Pokemon we got in gen 9
2:50 was so happy with wooloo as a meme i once beat sw/sh with a team of 6 of 'em, I regret nothing.
2:01 if its not 100% accurate then its 50% accurate So its 50% accurate not 33%
Orcanae??
5:29 oh god... THE CRINGENESS IS TAKING OVER-
4:10 Facts
Name it ordor
18:18 the tongue…
Is no one gonna talk about the shower montage?? 😶
Mikey: it only 30  Me: it 50% accurate. Mikey
not grunty boi putting shampoo on with a hat…
0:41 Oh honey, honey  We're all stupid
6:29 when team rocket finds out he’s fired
Grungy Boi putting shampoo on his hat omfg I’m dead
Mikey the first time Grunty Boi showed up: TEAM ROCKET! Mikey now: Oh, Hey dude.
So many of his made up pokemon actually appear in scarlet and Violet
Wait you get the running shoes instantly in newer games? I can’t afford the new games so I play fire red on an emulator so that was a good thing to know.
*lowkey kinda wants Grunty boy to break into my shower*
Switch the name to Orphane like orphan. If it’s a dark type it has an evil side. It’s evil because it’s an orphan hence the name orphane. It parents were hunted and now it seeks revenge.
Galarian Yamask was the first shiny I ever got
0:01 thats why i dont have mandjtv merch
ngl kinda sick of YouTubers not realizing that wearing merch with a big fat logo on it gets you bullied, and at the very least, weird looks.
Orcane should be orcoos😎
Grunty boi in the shower is EVERYTHING 😂
6:16, he made a remastered version of the fist Dr.Squatch sponsor
what the f was the shower montoge
Bruh grunty boi just be scrubbin
I'm so glad I'm seeing this AFTER your break. Don't get me wrong, take a break whenever you need. The end of this video was actually great advise for content creators.
I THOUGHT THE FRESH FALLS ON THE DOCTER SQUATCH BOTTLE SAID FRESH BALLS XD
14:51 Orcannon?
I bet you Jack be loving these shower montages
1:57 actually, if its not 100% accurate, then its 50% accurate.
12:38 that looks like it could be a regional evolution to larvesta or something
6:30 Squidward: “ oh no he’s hot!”
For orcane you could do orcanien
I gotta admit, I actually kind of despise lechonk’s design but he is legit on my top 10 favorite Pokémon list purely for his name
10:35 based on what are the sides split?
You are lucky you get to dr.squach cause I am a girl and Dr.squash is men's soap.
18:31 "We are just ordinary people driven to revenge in the name of justice. But if revenge is called justice, then justice would only breed even more revenge and become a chain of hatred."
Instead of orcane,, why not something like Orcagami, like Origami hehe
Mikey: I would buy that rice cooker Me, an Asian: You guys know what a rice cooker is??
7:39 ... gastle
Just beat the ice leader in Pokémon scarlet
mikey: mentions grunty boi grunty boi: who dare summon me
Me when grunty boi is doing the shower montages:🥵🥵🥵🥵😏😏😏😏😏
Wait what did he do to his eye in the beginning
That was my first shiny too! (Shiny g yamask)
I found the same shiny yamask
Orcane (Or Khan
Ah yes, ASPITPEYESTILLSTINGS
9:06 was a good person of interest meme
The Pokémon that you made that is an ice type exist in scarlet/violet
welcome back, oh and btw, you totally called a grass fire pepper pokemon
Team red
Was it just me or did he just want an excuse to strip on camera like we get it your hot but did you really have to show us agen
Boy boy boy what the hell
Grunty boi about to bust in to only show off the sponsor (and sometimes steal something)
grunty boi is daddy
blue pill
I cringed so hard when grunty Boi put shampoo on his hat😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣
10:37 BLUE BLUE BLUE BLUE BLUE I LITERALLY LIKE ALL OF THEM
"Its only 33% accurate" also mikey: if its not 100% accurate its 50% accurate
LECHONK
Mikey used put up hood. Mikey was hit with recoil damage.
6:51 is it weird I have the same towel....
Put my tea in one of the videos of Pokémon talk
If anyone here posts on this subreddit post winking castform from pokemon shuffle
orcanon, and give it a gun instead of a blow hole
You should check out Moxie2D, he redrew your Fakemon too!
I’ve done the research Mikey’s true hight 6,4
3:33 the funny thing about this meme is that, at least in the anime, kukui is actually a teacher at the Pokémon school.
I’m about to end this man’s whole career “hi Man-Dj-Tv
thze ham we get when making a sandwich in scarlet and violett is form pokem ons like miltank adn lechonk i mean think about it have you ever seen normal cows and pigs in pokemon and then thinm about it where do they get the meat from
Prophesee the fortune pokemon could be physic grass and it’s names is propheseed 😊😊
I got a shiny random blipbug in a raid 2 days after the game came out.
grunty boi whenever he's mentioned on meme review he appears
1:59 don't you mean 50%
10:36 i choose purple
Man dj tv😎
Venonat and venomoth or color different I feel like cosmoth  could be its evolution
I will believe Gogoat was your MVP. Not only do I love Gogoat, but I had a Stunfisk save me in the final battle with Ghetsis during my BW2 nuzlocke so... don't underestimate the less popular 'mons! You'll answer to Flat Daniel! lol
We is watching .ca utoobe god
Yeet
6:26 LOL THE POOR HAT XD
First Mikey makes a funny shower scene then literally makes a thirst trap 😂
Lechonk is the best Pokémon
6:25 bro is this another hat hair situation like what happened with jotaro??????
ive just realized what ASPITPIAY stands for 🤦🤦🤦
This is gonna sound bizarre but since I’m late to the party might as well say it bc no one will see.  I really love Galar Yamask’s shiny, and i really like how it was your first Mikey, so I’ll say mine. It was a Suicune in a dynamax adventure. I remember I had a Tyrantrum and I was playing with my cousins and we found out the legend was Suicune, one of my fav Pokémon, so of course we beat it and I caught it. I obviously took Suicune but I was confused because I saw the hair was a little darker and I checked it summary and BAM. I named it Snowcone, I love it, and I’m happy
14:42  Cetitan looks _so_ much better than that sorry!
magiraffe is literally Steven universe
I hope Mikey is okay after the intro
* *Michael giving a very depressing speech* *   Background music: 🎉🥳🎉
if those cast form dragons where plushies id buy them all
I mean, they clearly couldn’t have made it pronounced “arse phone”
I feel so bad for laughing when Mikey smacked himself in the eye with the hood, but that was so funny.
cut ur beard i like the old mandjtv
The way he wink my guy
Before I saw the grunty boi bit I thought he wasn't that funny anymore, then he mentions the shower scene and now I remember
I found a shiny in my nuzloke
name it horca (horn and orca) because of the hand drills
hornorb = sandshrew +dartoad
brawlive should be the evolution of smoliv
Hi
Take some time off to heal your eyes Mikey
Chestnaught is better on two legs don’t judge me.😈😠
I've started putting these on at work for something to listen to and man. So glad the manager who sits diagonal from me and can see my screen was gone during the shower break 😂
Right in the intro, you look like six from little nightmares.
Orcan nahh it's Orcap
I was doing a 5 star raid and Martins solrock used rockthrow but it missed and then we lost
We love you stay strong
It's so beautiful that grunty boy still wears his hat in the shower
Slick Goatee, King of Castform! Hail Yeah
I was actually dying at the ‘hm… yes the floor is made of floor’
17:33 I’d like emboar a lot more if that was its design
Oh God when I looked at the dartoad image they look like there doing the torture dance and now I cant unsee it
Isn't that platypus pokemon the water starter for TemTem?
10:34 this hurt me. Most of my favorite starters are on the blue side but my very first two starters are on the red side
Where is your girl
Rename orcane to orcan it would sound like or and khan put together orkhan or orcan
What does aspitypie mean, I've watch multiple episodes, and have no clue of it
I believe in grunty chad supremacy
Letinks might be the new gods arceus bidoof look out!!!
I spit a pie
Cosmoth's mock dex entry was a reference to Icarus
Weird how grunty boy grew a beard at the same time mikey did 🤔
Mikey 0 Hoodie 1 :D
Technically, a Hoodie is a massive threat to safety if used right
I'm sorry but captions is drunk again When Mikey says: Greetings pokefans! It turns into  Greeting boogie fans! And Aspitpiay it says instead, Ask Peter pie
Hope you’ve enjoyed your break Mikey! Glad to have ya back
wait grunty boi takes showers WITH his hat on?
I have vowed to use every early dog or wolf like pokemon in a game no matter what as a methood to cope with my dogs death, so i was really excited to see fidough.
2:51 He shouldn’t have fallen asleep at the sleepover
I can't wait till pokemon sv are in cause content
The frogs are saying sheeeeesh
Lockstins Worcane:  is also here

Rocanus
Leshoooooooooooonk

Uhh I could have sworn I was in your discord server, but when I tried looking for it (cus I FINALLY beat fricking Cynthia in bdsp) it just didn’t exist? Even in like the subreddit about pages there’s just no mentions of it?
conditioner, shampoo and dEOdarent
Watch I’m calling it lechonk evolves into lechad.
hi can you play a pokemon fan game name pokemon sors
I'm still salty about the fact that even when bdsp released they removed hidden power which I wanted to use why gamefreak I hope the tm returns to scarlet and violet as well as the moves return/frustration
ngl im a little scared hes gonna change his content to like raid shadow legends or something like that when he comes back i grew up on your content and enjoy your break dude
3:58
<3
there should be a michael plushie but with a beard
Gouri dings woody Vince Michael here   Mandjtv -16/8/2018 or 8/16/2018   10 types of Pokémon fans
10/10 start
It’s been a month since I’ve seen him upload
I love the move description of disarming voice “Letting out a charming cry, the user does emotional damage to opposing Pokémon. This attack never misses” oh no the Pokémon are gonna suffer from emotional damage😥
Please make Grunty Boi do the intro one day.
YouTube subtitles:  Greetings boogie fans
wait cant you just delete your moves by trying to teach tm/hm or level up moves
Also if u want a new name for orcane orcon is pretty good
4:01 no, no, no, he's still alive. He's extending his tail in and out like a Minecraft piston whilst laid down
I did a team sky playthru in pokemon x
hey mikey i think you should play pokemon xenoverse if you wonder why it has good story, new type, dragon type starter and grass fire type pokemon idk if you still want it but i think should play it
I wonder when he’s finally gonna be back I know he said it would be like a month and a half but that was a while ago
6:17  “OH NO HES HOOOT!!”
No your not stupid how could Anyone be stupid when they made a title Pokémon clap clap meme review
Fun fact: your meme (arcoos) has the word coos in it and in hebrew coos means penis. Still loving this name?
New scarlet and violet pokemon
hail yeah
are you coming back
this guys like the only reason I even remotely care about Pokémon
when the smart kid gets a 98% on the test:Noooooooo everybody else, who got 10%: Bro chill we got worse Also the smart kid, who watches MandJTV: If it isnt 100% it is 50%
I got a random shiny in BDSP without the shiny charm lol
What happened to Pokémon talk? Please bring it back
Me having three shiny Pokémon that are all ice type random encounters without shiny charm 😎
EVERYONE THERE IS  A NEW SCARLET AND VIOLET TRALER IT JUST UP LOADED GO WATCH IT NOWWW
React to the kaskade plot video or else
Do team sky pls
Who agrees that should make a male evolution for salandit call outburn (outlaw - burn)
Honestly mikey is very unlucky I thought I was unlucky but I got 2 random shinies during my play through of sword
I got my first ever random shiny 2days ago. Sadly it was a Krabby so it looks horrible
Please react to small ants can you beat x but all treiners pokemon are level 100
For when the Tyrantrum chased them in Pokemon GO, i would put Joltik instead at times, because it looks like a skittle is chasing you
MandJTV  I love your channel and when you come Back  Could you please rate Pokemon Team's My team is:  1.Blaziken  2.Garchomp  3.Togekiss  4.Swampert  5.Scizor  6.Toxicroak    And Have an Excellent Break 😁!
I love that Kamados name is a shorten version of Rowan’s Japanese name nanakamado
U take that break king
Moxie 2d made your pokemon you should react to it
When is he gonna make another video
Don't even know about pokémon playhouse
When you look at Pokémon trainers teams what website do you use to get all that detail for the moves?
I after i see this another time facepalm meme : There is another
Hope the hat is ok…
19:14 uhh, Mikey (or Katie) I would recommend looking at the words under dartoad, it's not just the frog pokemon
Hey isn’t lockstins pseudo legend called worcane
Dude get your rest. Work to live don't live to work. Your health has to come first.
Hottest Poketuber for a reason
Hey Mikey, I know you probably wont read this but, I have a video suggestion for the second channel. Its about this game called Loomian Legacy on a platform (I'm sure you know of) called, Roblox. Its basically a fan made Pokemon game. I'm not sure if you saw but Purplecliffe made a few videos on the game and they were really entertaining so I would like to see you try it out, thanks for reading bye :)
Can grunteboy play arkoos
6:26 I was with my family when this happened and my mom saw it. She thinks I’m gay now..,
Mikey how can you abandon us like that
What happened to Pokémon talk? I love your show. Bring it back
Some your fakemons, should be real Pokemon.
I’ll miss Mikey’s new uploads but he really deserves this and I love his channel
More Lechonk meme review

Some of the drawings of mandjtv's pokemon are pre evolution and some after evolution
Take all the time you need king, we’ll wait don’t worry about us💪

Squirtle predicted hat customisation
E, commenting to help with the algorithm
amazingly incredible
A new sexy grunty boi scene!!!
Diş you see moxie2d’s art?
I disagree with desidueye
I would definitely be interested in seeing your take on other games and other types of games than Pokémon. Personally my favourite YouTuber that I now watch every video (and they come out daily and he does his own editing) is Jawoodle and he plays mostly 7 Days To Die, but with other games sprinkled in.  I would definitely love to see you playthrough Raft or maybe Little Nightmares (which is a do-able terrifying if that makes sense).
My Pokémon Scarlet/Violet team: Sprigatito, Lechonk, Smoliv, Pooper, and two more Smoliv
The unedited captions still says ask Peter pie…time doesn’t change I suppose
Mikey can I join team sky? please I used to be team ice or whatever it’s called (side note someone took a blow dryer to three poler ice caps and now they’re gone) but please can I join I ummmm where is it? I I Ummm I have a charzard costume I can be your mascot???? PLEASE I NEED A JOB🫠 please get enough likes so Mikey can see it
Its been a month 11 days mikeys dead
POV you posted a good meme but you were unlucky that it didn't show in the video
You need this Mikey we can wait just don't leave us permanently please
orcaterror
Best channel bro
Pls come back
I really miss Pokémon talk when you tell them to make a new video for a long time
I couldn’t post it on the subreddit due to my parents restricting it, but I drew a fan made flying type eevee evolution called Angeon.
I have caught two main series shines and booth of them were without the shiny charm and random
Grunty boy should play Pokemin Fire Red Team Rocket Edition
rename ORcane to ORphan
I want some help I want to make my own team “team galaxy” and they want to take over space
This isn't that different the last video was 2 months ago ic not that different so ye
If you make the A in Aspitapiay and make it a I ot sounds like I SPIT A PIE I was tired when typing this
you now bulbasaur and squirtle stll have the rights to pokemon talk
17:45 that was actually the evelutions of your pokemon, atleast i think.
Team sky
3:00 Miraiadon can actually do that
You've made a paradox, Michael. If it's not 100% accurate, it's 50% accurate. But 50% accurate isn't 100% accurate, so it's 50% accurate. However, yet again, 50% accurate is still not 100% accurate, which means it is 50% accurate. BUT! 50% accurate is not 100% accurate. It will go on forever.
When it's 12 days into the month and your still hoping for an aspitpiay even though you know and support Mikey's break
Dude has a beard
I feel bad for Mikey because I found a random shiny klinklang right after I beat the champion
I have a suggestion for a play through, you can only use Pokémon which contain a “number word” such as doduo, dugtrio, etc idk if this is doable but good luck
I killed my bulbasaur plushy
Pokémon scarlet and violet has a new trailer
6:24 RIP grunty hat.
It feels so weird... seeing grunty boy and mikey so chill with eachother considering thei past interaction its enought to make a grown trainer cry :')
A real fan is a fan that understand if a youtuber didn't upload for weeks
6:48 I HAVE THAT TOWEL
Creative Burnout is real, take your rest buddy.
Where’s this month’s meme review
I’m not used to Mikey having a beard, I haven’t seen you in like a year. I like it :)
0:00 Me: well that went wrong
Good luck with your time off
MandJTV stands for michael and john television
10:40 pick blue
Call it ordinary
It would be cool if prophesee got a special boost to future sight and if ottosum could hold multiple berries
it's not 33% it's 50% can't even get his own made up stats right
Will Pokémon talk ever come back?
I whant Grunty boi merchandise
I got a shiny Beldum in Pokemon ultra sun for 9 months.
Can I join team sky pls
Watching this again. hit harder today as a hobby writer trying to make it a career. Not sure you'll even read this at point, but hope it works out regardless!
I think the hoodie bonk was just a bit for mikey blazing up before meme review
hoodie used stun! its super effective!
Oof
Idea:Adaman is Prof.Sycemore's ancestor

WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE GRUNTY BOI SHOWER MONTAGE???? LMFAO
Jesus loves you and God bless all
Lechungus is cursed
Hey mandjtv when you are back from your well needed break I have a video idea it would be what if all the gym type leader fought so for example nessa vs misty
When you realize grunty boy shampoos his hat- 🤣
Do Pokémon talk again
What game has the most pokemon in it
Why does grunty boi wear his hat in the shower
greetings boogie fans michael here my eye still stings and welcome back to the newest episode of ask peter pie    …
since when did magiraffe have the rinnegan?
I smell cheese
You and pm7 are my favorite youtuber😃
17:25 Am i the only one who think that they look very bad like this? Well, except Emboar, others looks awful.
8:10 Well... Technically it's Arceus, and not Arkoos, since it's arCphone, and there is no C in Arkoos
Give us back pokemon talk
lechonk chon- chong- chungus lechungus
2:56 Aged like fine wine.
I really hope they make a spider-ghost looking pokemon for Scarlet and Violet kind if like the Mind Flayer from stranger things and its name should be like "Tarantuphantom" and it would be really cool
Mikey, PLEASE play cookie run kingdom or ovenbreak again!!!! I just want to see the pure confusion in your eyes since so much changed!!!
...your the best 👌!!!!!!!!!
Just beat Pokémon Sword with shiny Skydios!!! Hope you're happy!
hey uh wouldn’t it be cool if you made a discord server based on team sky? that’ll be very cool
The new professors are named after trees wtf everyone talking about
“Dartoad the horny frog Pokémon” I’m losing my self rn
I noticed the rivals of Ather orcane as well and I thought it was funny
Grunty boy is the most sexy man sense waluigi
I just realized your birthday is one day after mine
Cosmoth is so cute(I like moth unlike other people), I feel so bad it dies like that!
0:00 R.I.P oof sound
Everyone needs vacations and creative work especially needs some variation to stay interesting for the creator. Take the time you need, Mikey. It's important time.
Sorry about putting pressure on you Mikey I’ll try not to do it again🐯🐅 random emoji
damn, he’s still the hottest pokétuber
*parent walks in at 6:17 *  Me: i can explain
Nooooooooooooooooo, don’t leave us
make sure you take 100% atvanteg of  this brake beacuse if its not 100% its 50%
I made a new evoulution Moleform! a evoulution of castform
If lechonk has an evolution it should be called lechungus (I had no idea it was in the video as well 😂)
M and J TV i thought it was Mand J TV
thought one of the shampoos in the sponsor said fresh balls
R.I.P mikey’s eye lol
The new Pokémon generation is literally just getting a team of 3 dozen gen Z kids to make all the characters and Pokémans.
The shampoo on the hat 🤣🤣
Mikey this has nothing to do with meme review but my favorite Pokémon is castform because of you
"i've never been a big chessnoghut"  -micheal groth
I just realized that when I'm half-asleep, Aspitpiay sounds like "I spit a pie."  (also who needs sleep when you can watch MandJTV poketubing)
Sure take your time we can wait have a great vacations
Before the actual Intro it reminded me of dawkos intro >:)
Mikey, truegreen7 has made a legendary form of castform in his last video
Michael has a beard now Great job Michael you made me feel old thank you for that I still love your videos even now you look good in a beard you just look different and it threw me off completely
The Pokemon Rice-Cooker animation was done by @NCHProductions! :) There's a awesome entire video on it!
hey, Masters EX got a LOT of new story content lately, are you going to continue lets playing it someday?
What happened to pokemon talk
Meme review due
1 month later into the future, and still no new meme review
I love you caught a SHINY UMBREON
Mikey it's Ben a month
meme review  of july month is due mandjtv , i really want to see it
Did you not know you inspired some of Pokémon for new region
Play if you won to
Elden ring
im proud that my first time i was in like the ruins of sword and shield, i found a shiny golurk.
Orcanes new name could be torca aka torture/torment + orca
10:30 idk if the original poster mentioned it but that animation of the fuecoco ricecooker is by nchproductions
17:45 most of them are like evolutions of the original
You got this Mikey, you're awesome 💜 Hope you get a good recharge!
Hoi I'm bulbasuar and I'm squirtle Greeting pokefans! I'm mandjtv and HAHA it is I grunty boi
TEAM ROCKET!  Hey dude what's going on!
I love how Mikey went from "WHO ARE YOU? HOW DID YOU GET IN MY HOUSE" To " Hey Dude!" I love the character development
I hope you back in going to miss you 😢
Lechonk is cute, but his colors are too dark
Everybody: Violet&Crimson box art Pokémon look like motorcycle lmao Gamefreak: 🤠
I made an evo for castfrom
YES GRUNT BOI
This is my team in fire red KFC  a  Moltres  Cold KFC my articuno
I wanna join the Reddit so incredibly badly but I have a wee bit of trauma because of it
we'll wait for you 😭🤠
Those shower clips make me uncomfortable
You literaly took a break from making videos when i made a meme that had a lot of upvotes on your sub (for the first time) Bruh
Grunty boii is the best
12:31 copper golem
❤️
Your so cool! Hope you notice this but I have been a daily watcher on your videos hope you get a shiny in scarlet or violet *question what you choosing*
play cuphead with pokemen7 or purple cliffe either way it would make an amazing video
Mikey left at just about the wrong time since the new gen 9 stuff was announced
Hey Mikey when Scarlet and Violet come out are you going to do a Playthru of that like a steam sky cause on the Nintendo stuff it says well doesn’t say it shows a picture of Portland being able to fly
Mikey f227 first to make our videos amazing videos and now you make garbage videos again please be awesome
19:15 Its the WHAT FROG POKEMON????
ABDKWIDBSHE GRUNTY BOY PUTTING SOAP ON HIS HAT KILLED ME
Remember when grunty boy had a personality Now hes just the sponsor.
5:10 I knew it!
1 month later
Plz bring back Pokémon talk
L E C H O N K
PIG!!!!
Love the pokemon meme reviews but tbh gotta disagree with what's goin on at 17:31. I already don't mind the two-legged starter evolutions (honestly i think people kinda make way too big a deal about em) but these just feel, unnatural compared to their normal looks, like a person trying to walk on all 4s. Just doesn't work for me.
Grunty boi gets more money than any onlyfans
Orcane should be called Orchaos
Blue side it’s got Rowlet and Rowlet evolves into. Decidueye mmmmmm
Mental health is important! Enjoy the vacation!
I just thought that charzard is a lizard and Fuecoco is gonna be a komodo dragon
Moxie made your pokemon aswell i think
@MandJTV wheres your next video ;(
His beard, is glorious
Bring back pokemon talk
its fine mikey we all understand we all still love you
I found shine subway to but couldn't get it 😡
I completely understand why you are taking a break from YouTube. Burnout is a very real thing. As much as I will miss the weekly videos I am not angry about you taking a break.   Mikey you are a wonderful YouTuber and deserve a break. Have a wonderful break and we will be here when you are ready to come back.
17:24   Wow, this greatly upsets me in the best way. I disagree with Mikey on Chesnaught, but Emboar and Inceneroar look amazing and if Emboar was like that it may be my favorite starter or even pokemon.
I try to make memes and discussions on the Subreddit page, but the mods keep getting rid of them for being “Low effort” or “illiterate” right when I post them. Comment on this comment if this as happened to you as well, and for MandJTV if you’re seeing this comment, I guess you can contact me and I can send you the posts that way because if the mods don’t let me post anything, then so be it.
14:56 Call it Orcatalyst
Go react to moxie2d remake of your Pokémon Ps Love your content
Pokémon sword as a ground type gym leader
NO! PLEASE!
What if team sky had an animation where rayquaza zigzagged across the stars then it froze and made a s
The Sinnoh starters are my favorite.
0:00 or 0:01 It's super Effective!
I won’t be surprised if Fuecoco ends up Fire/Grass, even if it overlaps with Sprigatito! Why? Well, 1. Fuecoco’s design is based on a chili pepper and 2. It works! We have a Fire/Water legendary (Volcanion) and a Grass/Water regular mon (Ludicolo). We could have a Fire/Grass starter!
How about Arca instead of Orcane?
Mor gen 9 Pokemon
Dang normally I have to pay for a show like that in the ad

Your intro gives me socksfor1's sub Reddit intro
Of course right when you hit the month mark there’s a Pokémon Presents…
3:36 Sonia is the best professor
I don't think anyone will complain with you taking off. People need time off from doing the same thing over and over again. I doubt it matters, But I'm perfectly fine waiting even several years to see another video posted to the best poketuber channel out there. We will cya later :3
Porygon is such an underrated pokemon. It's good in battle and stands out to every other pokemon. Like if you like porygon!  Justice for porygon!
I have in idea make a new move for all of his Pokémon of every type
Can i get a hail yeah?
Make the intro of meme review bearded and more funny (this is a good idea) :)
We need to get Mikey to 2 million before he's back from his break
Please get this 69 likes please.
I felt that in the intro
Are you nanogenix twin?
6:28 dam I’m gay
Promo equals lol
It’s okay Mikey, we all support you and believe that you can do this! You deserve a break. Maybe a longer one!
Watch stranger things on a video

Ok welll it’s fine if you take a break and make videos on mandjtv clips
Good for u 💖
You should see Tc's Mew and Mewtwo series It's like really good as in really REALLY good
2:01 50 percent accuracy isn’t that bad don’t worry about it
The second grunty Boi rubbed his armpits, I immediately thought "Dr. Squatch" before they said it 🤣
6:28 Someone: how many Times did You rewatch that scene  Me: hum i uh i Chonk?
whyyyy
MandJTV why have you not played pokemon hipno`s lullaby so far?!?
Me: him washing his hat 👍🏻
I don’t understand the joke at 11:00

2 weeks
My ultra sun team Decidueye,ninetales(alolan form),totem gumshoos,mudsdale,midday lycanroc,alolan raichu
Wait if it’s only 33 percent accurate and there are 3 off them that only makes 99 where the 1?
Sexy shower montage 2.0
3:59 oh goodness…… already that is dark…. But still awesome meme though
I know pokémon is your thing but, while not speaking for all your subscriber, I think we’d love to see you do other content.

Once you get back to posting you need start back up pokemon talk
Darto sus 19:16

I believe you would love playing pokemmo.
Make gen 8 team sky damit we need it
i bought the mytey plushie
Please do a grass then vs now
Fun fact:Pokédex entries are actually just exaggerated false info to make the games appealing so that spoink is alive to anyone who is sad
My first random shiny in galar was a rolycoly with no shiny charm
Hello guys i'm new here subscribed, i'm from Indonsia i'm an english learner as well.😊
Will you still be in some of John’s videos?
You should react to Moxie2D's recreation of your Pokemon / Fakemon
Since Mikey said that Orcane could be either Water- Dark or Water- fighting, make it Water-fighting, and for his new name, name him OrGAINS
E
"I was going to say the sexy shower montage" lol.
I remember my first random shiny,  So in Pokemon Sword's Dlc I was finding Moltres' closest to-get-to spot, and I was getting triggered by all these sharpedos (sry if spelt wrong), so when I finally found the closest spot to Moltes' path a sharpedo fin came up just before I was home free. I literally yelled "I SWEAR FOR THE LOVE.. of", I stopped because I heard a twinkle sound, so I look at the screen to find a pinkish sharpedo just there, of course I made the little pit stop to catch the thing :)
Look at moxie2ds art
There is no such thing as a coincidence
Hey, have you tried the pokemon fan game pokemon:wilds? It is an OPEN WORLD pokemon game with the style of pokemon gold or silver, it's still in early production, but its really good!
It's name should be orcacorio lol
That hood is an aspitapy
When you come back react to Moxie2Ds pokemon he made for you
Its already been 3 weeks and we dearly miss you…
I was replaying through bdsp and accidentally threw my master ball at a gible -_-

Dude CobraKhanGaming from the Uk I flippin Love you you and Grunty Boi are bloody Brilliant my favourite YouTuber and I’d love to keep seeing more of you I hope you enjoy your time and out and congratulations 🎉  a successful move I hope you having a great time sincerely wishing you the best of. Any of your endeavour’s for the future 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Is it just me or does Doomoose look like it could be a design concept for a villain from My Little Pony.
I used to think your name was MAND JTV
When did you grow the beard?
Wait Michael grew a beard how long have I not watch his channel for
My friend says arceus like arKus
Pov you have two accounts and subbed to Mikey two two times
shave it dude...
BRUNTY BOI IS HOTTER (unpopular opinion Grunty boi is the hottest poketuber not mikey)
If I worked for 8 straight years without a vacation, I would've quit. Enjoy your time off.
Thanks for the great cont, Mikey. Have a nice break. :)
Do you hear all the voice cracks that grungy boi had
Also falscourge is cool but mimikyu is better
Every time I see the knockoff Kirby I don’t want to watch this show
Why are you talking with such a high voice, your normal deeper voice is 100% better
I have been watching you for a while. you deserve a break I have seen a lot of YouTubers end up quiting due to burnout. take your time,and have a good time off :D
'looks at the video' yep, he's still the hottest poketuber.
We love you Mikey, take breaks when you want ;)
No, I don't think I'll ask Peter Pie.
The way that grunty boy puts shampoo on his hat🤣
I am honestly surprised that you think YouTube commenters are smarter than you
Michael: *takes a break* Me:it’s been a year daddy🥺 and I really really miss you…
Rip casfrom
11:17 so does he know its animal crossing?
I was too slow to submit designs for your Pokémon

10:51 If there will be a platypus, then a agent Pokemon, because it's the only platypus 99% of humanity know
6:54 It doesn't have to be trees, but plants. And yes I realized it before
Him: gone in a few days  Me still watching 3 weeks after release
When you come back can you continue Pokémon talk plz
OH YEAH THIS REMINDS ME! I drew some pretty bad concept art of a Fairy/Dragon Pokémon named Dracandy, and somebody remade it for me!

Hope ur break is doing you a lot of good!
we finally got grunty boy's sexy shower montage pt.2
We’ll miss you bro ❤️
Why are you taking a break from this channel?😭
You have to make more videos
PLAY POKÉMON INFINTY
Pixel dip quit a year ago
Rip pixel dip
I watched a video cursed who's that pokemon and its 4 miunits and 52 seconds and i got two only
I am sorry that you were overworked, my mom is overworked and never has time to hang or even talk to me and my sister, most of my life she was a single parent but recently she got married! But he has not moved in yet, i hope that your break goes well and see you in a month or two.
When you come back can you make a pokemon types then vs now video?
I like whats hip, happening, and trendy. I'm always checking it out. Listen, have you heard about thia new "Lechonk Meme"? That's right! Of course you know! I mean sheesh, "Lechonk Meme"...It's the hottest thing in cool! Whevever your from, "Lechonk Meme" is the biggest thing right?
Good luck mate
Play Pokémon uiranium version
Will you ever do more Pokemon rap battles?
When are you making an other video
the art made me think of how cute Flopflap would have been in the anime, Mikey think about that on your break occasionaly, it will help I promise <3
If it’s dark type: Orchaos If it’s fighting type: Orcombo
Its name should change to like orpa8n or smh
14:51 i think itd be cool to give a reference to the game and orcane by calling it orcanine lol
Scarlet and violet's perfect pokemon is xatu becuse everything in the pokedex talks about the past and The future. So I hope it's it will get a new form.
Hey man. Big props for you to recognize the situation and publicly acknowledge it. You take care of yourself and come back when you fell like you do.
I also thought that was another Charizard. It is my first time to experience a new generation as a pokémon fan with an actual nintendo console.
Most of us have decided that scarlet and violet is based on Spain so I think tauros is gonna have a big part because bulls are a big part of Spanish culture
Those are great memes, and you are amazing and should focus on yourself. Real life health always prioritizes over everything else. We will be here when you get back.
To be honest, MandJTV Deserves more subscribers, for how much effort he puts in his videos, keep up the good work :)
Screw it my first run of sv is a lechonk only run,
i know this is completely not related to the video but what about team sky in the Aloan region
Pov:you reccomend Mikey he make an evolution to his channel mascot pokemon or ask someone to do that Mikey:good idea Pov:I'll do it myself
I used to watch DanTDM and he used to do 2 videos a day, idk how y’all do that.  So take the break you need, everyone needs breaks.
Take a good break man!  You deserve it!
2:00 Are you sure about that?
im gonna name my lechonk technoblade rip legend
i might of already said this but haha hsi guarantee boy
You are more likely to get hit by a meteor than getting all shiny versions of Spinda
NOOO!!! Dont GO MIKEY!!!!!
The name Orcane sounds like a play on the word arcane, like a Water Psychic type.
finally I get to watch every video of yours without having to watch the new ones
Me: switches an 100% accurate move for a more hard-hitting 95% accurate move Michael: if its not 100% accurate its 50% accurate Me: WHAT HAVE I DONE
Nice
i respect your decision, good luck, and take your time whenever your ready you can come back.
Do a duel against Grunty Boi
Well time to rewatch pokemon talk for the 100th time! Congrats on the break Mickey! You deserve it!
Poor spoink
:( please dont stop
Make a video of if a mega diamax plz
Not sure if you reacted to this already “Pokemon Moves, Literally, (Remastered)”
HAVE A NICE  TIME AND BRAKE
Take a nice long break man you need it
Hey man take a break as long as you need, we’ll miss ya but we wanna see you at your best
I understand how you could need this "sabbatical", I think that was the word. I was writing a novel and sort of got tired of working on it. Just thanks for all the work you put into your videos and for all the enjoyment almost 2 million get to have because of you.
Mikey now you have to wach moxies video of your pokèmon
4:00 how it feels to be a guinea pig owner.  I have once found a guinea pig just looking like she was sleeping... but it was a bit more permanent... So every time i catch my guinea pigs lying flat on the side sleeping... i panic a little bit.
Me : oh no I can’t get in stupid 🥲🥲🥲
On your next vid do moxxie 2Ds video

6:29 The things he does for us.
Grunty Boi showers with his hat on, and he put SHAMPOO on his HAT!  This is the best keeping in character I've ever seen.
If you wish to take a break, then all we can do is respect your choice.
Please don’t stop YouTube but have a good break
Mikey why no team sky nuzlocke
Someone redesigned your fakemon
What team Scott you know go to galler and my team makes it so you have to not catch yveltal if you hire me in your next aspodapie
yo mandjtv your pokemon is in the new pokemon game!
I'm from Portugal and i love you Mikey, you re the only pokemon content I genuinely love it, you are funny, friendly, i really hope you come back soon. Love you ❤️
Pig pig is evolution of lechonk
The “takes of your art” we’re all stolen from Moxie2D…
He's a good creator and I hope he can continue for longer.
Why have a Pokémon channel featuring sexy shower montages when you could have a sexy shower montage channel featuring Pokémon? 🤔
A couple weeks ago I caught a shiny Eevee in a Time Distortion in Pokemon Arceus did I evolved it into a Vaporeon
pokemon talk victini
enjoy ur break :)
I have literally found like 6 random shinies in sword/shield beartic, xurcitree, Lotad, basculin, garboder, and freakin DURANT I didn’t even know I had a SHINY DURANT until my cousin wanted a shiny Pokémon and I gave him it. Also are there any comments on my profile picture? (Togekiss and Mr.Mime
Does he still have a discord server?
Brawlive looks like a smoliv evolution! Just saying.
I wasn't here when this series started and I just realized that aspitpiay stands for ''at some point in the past I asked you'' even though he says it in EVERY FLIPPIN' EPISODE and I feel like my whole life is a lie
SMOLive and LeCHONK  When you realize Gen 9 is the meme generation.
*After 6 years, FINALLY, I have found you.*  Mikey showering with a hat!1!1111!111!!1!11
Hey guys does anyone remember the Dr squatch training soap game
No mikey

Looks like mandjtv got the electric/fighting type he wanted in pawmi’s evolution
We will miss you we love you
How did that hurt?!?
bye have a good holiday
GRUTYBOY STOR MY TAL
Did you know there's food named Lapchong it's make from pig
I TAKE THE RED PILL
i know that tyhis legend is having some well deserved and much needed time off, but some of you meme creators, i had the idea (or potentially saw it somewhere else, however felt like it was an original idea...) Id love to see the Eeveeloutions be tweked alittle with being dual typing...however to get this, you need to breed a Flareon and Jolteon, or other combos, to make these new Eevees?   What do we think of the idea...any cleaver artists wanna do some combo drawing :D :D
Take all the time you need man! I'm sure all of your true fans will be here and be waiting to see what new exciting videos that the new, well rested, and reinvigorated Mikey uploads for us! Thanks for all of these past years of constant content. It helped get me through a really tough and depressing time a few years ago, and has also helped me through the struggles I'm going through now too. So thank you, and I hope you enjoy your break. You definitely deserve it!  See you when you come back!
what website did you use when looking at the gym leaders' team?
Is he taking a break to make an only fans after that add read 😂
I think he deserves to get 0.19 more subscribers so when he returns he will have 2 millions subs
What Pokémon would you rather choose cast form or lower helix
Please take all the time you need, we're all here for you!
How do I get it do I how do I like you know like get to share my drawing I don't know well I'm going to draw jalamoto
I've found a new pokemon fan game have you play pokemon Xenoverse
I found my new crush grunty boy
I found my new crush grunty boy
This may have been explored before but… what if Empoleon was ice type instead of steel? Empoleon is a penguin who lives in the cold so it makes perfect sense for it to be an ice type And, while still weak to Infernape, it would still have a STAB advantage to Torterra with Ice Beam, levelling out things a bit! Also I’m thinking of Empoleon’s trident face but with ice and that just makes me want this even more!
0:09
Hold up so I have no shiny charm yet in one night 12-7 I got 16 shinies and 2 alpha shinies (buneary and torterra)
Again I ask you: How do you catch the mall?! I can’t do It, I used a master ball and all that happened was the ball bounced off and I was almost arrested for loitering and vandalism. I told him a YouTuber told me I gotta catch the Mall, and he didn’t buy it. He told me it was Gotta catch them all and I didn’t understand. I was sure of what you said. I am now hiding from the authorities and learning how pronunciations actually work.
Day 1 of asking Michael to do a pokemon platinum challenge run where he only uses new evolutions from old pokemon (and a starter)
Pokemon
Man him and purple cliff and pm7 single handedly got back into Pokémon and YouTube
Do more pokesmp pls
For 8 years, I've been loving every bit of content of yours I've watched. I always loved how you were able to make all this, and I'd say you've more than deserved a break. Your videos have helped me when I've at my worst, and you've just been a wonderful presence in my life. You deserve this break, take as much time as you need! <3  ~ Emma, ShadowLugia33, ShadowDoublade33, I've got a few
we all love you and there is nothing wrong in taking a break everyone needs no matter what enjoy the break you finally dicided tho take love you 😊
Thank you so much for explaining it, you really need the break. Personally I’ve been having my own sort of “burn out” as a viewer to your videos, and I hope you have a great break. You are my favorite “Poke-tuber.” <3
Can u plz react to my memes
What happened to Pokemon talk
Still waiting for the greetings Pokémon prestige’s LIRD Michael here lol
1:55 are you sure about that?
The Grunty Boi ads keep getting better
What if terrakidd could have 2 “forms” (not interchangeable), one quadrupedal and one hexapedal. These two forms tell you if it’s going to be a parkhorn, (a physical attacker with moves like rock slide and stone edge), or parkhera, (a special attacker with moves like meteor beam and ancient power)
The side I'm on is probably the left side because my 1st 2 starters ever were torchic and froakie although the right side has Squirtle,Scorbunny,Snivy,and Chimchar
RIP MandJTV. I will never forget you
😂 the next time he moves again, another shower scene again.
I had a question. Mega Evolution was introduce in gen6, then why would starter pokemon in gen1-Kanto region, get Mega evolution instead of Greninja, Chesnaught and Delphox
Mandjtv the last video I just watched was the Pokémon names mispronounced and rayquaza is pronounced ray-kwaze-uh but I own a book and it says ray-kwaz-uh so it changed like ten years ago
I'm a bit late, but everyone needs a break to go out and smell the flowers, and there's other youtubers that can fill in the gap and when you come back we'll be waiting and I realize how creepy that actually sounds but I don't care lol
he says at some point in the past i asked you but i don’t remember him asking us something
I love your content so much I saw a comment where someone said that the young version of you has a voice which is higher than a blisssis HP
I just remembered that I forgot to catch the shiny green Walmart  because of the shiny subway DARN IT!
Sad to hear you and Purplecliffe grew distant, I’ll miss the chaotic John-Jack-Mikey trio
Mikey I hope you enjoy your break cuz you deserve it from burnout. I'm anticipating for your return to come back & play Pokémon Scarlet & Violet  Violet.
Michael I'm surprised you're taking a break from YouTube and also what My Least the Pokemon  nessa's Dreadnought and those Pokemon sword and shield for my first ever Pokemon games no joke
Mikey: “I won’t be uploading for a while” Me: (INSERT SADNESS AND SARROW THE SONG)
Yo Mikey, what if when you’re back you switch from focusing mainly on Pokémon to bouncing between a couple games? It doesn’t even have to be that many, just enough so that if you’re really not wanting to do Pokémon you can find a game that you’re more excited to play! And heck, it doesn’t even have to be a game, you could do things like “Try Not to Laugh”, “Fan Art Reviews” or other things of the sort, anyway these are just a few ideas for when you come back!😁
See u soon mandjtv 👍👍👍😁
16:19 Mikey doesn’t notice Saxolotle drinking
Hopefully you will become stronger on your vacation. I will continue to watch older videos to help give me monetization while you’re away
I don’t get the one meme. It’s clearly called the Arse Phone
Grunty boi is the very definition of a meme god.
Lechungus YES YEEESSSSS
Can we talk about how nice Mikey's shower is? I think it's one of those glass door ones, and it's got those fancy tiles in the back! Mikey's got some NICE real estate!
I hope you don’t quit because people do this and then don’t upload for like 5 or 4 YEARS I hope dat not happen
This is the only channel I don’t skip the sponsor segment on
Feel better soon❤️❤️
Orcane should be called orpain
We will miss you micheal
When I see Orcane I know think Orcanine
You can change the organe name to lanphin as means Land plus dolphin  My nickname.  Orcas are in dolphin family.  Lanphin just cool name 😎
Mandjtv body hot
I hope you have a nice break! Take it easy and recharge properly, I will still be here waiting for you whenever you’ll come back. 😊   I have been planning on making a comic for you for ages, I wonder if I’ll actually finish it before you return? 🤣😅🥲
Honestly Mikey you deserve a break, and please don’t feel pressured to come back if you don’t feel ready, at the end of the day your mental health matters more than our entertainment
Can I use miltank on a team sky team if the reason is that it gets punted to the moon?
The Nintendo Wii U and 3DS are shutting down next year in March. I have a lot of DS pokemon titles to grind.
You take care of you man. We wanna see a happy and geeky Mikey that loves what he does, not a tired and burnt out Mikey that feels forced to do his thing. We all love you and hope you are enjoying your time off. In the event that you actually see this comment I am in hopes to make your day by asking to join Team SKY. I have already made a team and have enjoyed making people rage quit on Poke'mon Showdown with it. I do hope to one day make this team in an actual game.
Hey mandjtv umm video idea team sky in legends arkoos bc new braviary  You dont need to do it but just an idea. i really love your videos i started watching you really late but your the best youtuber ever 😁
Evolving Galarian Yamask wirgiyr gauged abtrguvf like a focus dash is a huge pain lol
Some thing I think would be cool in Gen nine would be to see Megas Z moves and gigantic max Just like ash in journeys
You shueld react to the great journey of bidoof!
Did you know that almost all remakes come out doubles from the original ones like in gen 2 remakes come out gen 4 and 4 is double 2 gen 3 got there remakes in gen 6 and 6 is double 3 the only one that’s not like this is the gen 1 remakes in gen 3 not double of 2
What happened to mandjtv archives?
Ima about to ruin this man’s feelings  Hi MAN DJ TV
Does anybody else want plushies of these new Mikeymon?
Check out moxie 3ds art
POKÉMON TOWEL
Sprink😂😂😂😂 that name
Both of the Raidons are based on crested anoles
Mikey's been on that grind. Take that time off, brother. Personal wellbeing will always be infinitely more important than content.
Dartoad the what frog pokemon?
still is hottest poke-tuber
Give a shout-out to grunty boy for  putting shampoo on a hat
Mikey:Aspitpiay Captions:Ask Peter pie
Tbh doomoose and absol sound like they’re related
As soon as gruny boy came up and rubbed his pit I knew it was Dr. Squatch.
At Some Point In The A_? Past I Asked You
Actually, there are Sado and Turo trees. Also orcanes new name should be orbane.
Pokemon talk burn out part 2:
Could you please react to moxie2d redrawing all your pokemon.
Orcane could be named Orcami maybe😅
And I love your content
Hi new creator to YouTube it is really stressful
Hey Mikey I used a team generator for beep and I would like you to rate it The team is Torterra  Garchomp  Dragonite Gliscore Ludicolo Froslass  Please give this team a rating I would like to know your thoughts
hey man you have to take care of yourself first. I understand being a workhorse as I'm right there with you but you can't let it destroy what you really love doing. take the time. get your rest and get your feels back. you need it. and you will feel better for it.
MIKEY CONTINUE PIXELMON PLEASEEEE
You deserve it
I know it’s a bit late and you’re probably not reading comments now with your break, but I will always be here to support you Mikey, I’ve been on YouTube since 2010 and in the 12 years I’ve been here you are the only YouTube I’ve ever bought Merch for, and even though I’ve only been subscribed to you for a little over a year you’ve provided me just as much, if not more, entertainment than channels that I’ve been following for almost 10 years now. I hope you can come back soon Mikey, best of luck to you
Is ok Mikey! Everyone needs some time out at least once in a while!!! Take the time you need. We are not going anywhere haha!!
Aw Mikey gonna miss your videos but understand and hope you have a nice break and take some time to relax and come up with some amazing new stuff
Mikey when are you gonna do Pokemon talk again
GO TEAM SKY
wtf i stop watching this dude for just 4 years and suddenly he grows a beard? htf does that happen?
Can you react to Moxie2D drawing your pokemon designs
How about or cane's name can be orpain!!!
Just check in on your least-stressful social media once in a while. It makes some of us sad to feel ghosted by creators that bring us joy. Wishing you calm! We'll be here when you can get back :)  Don't let Grunty boii take over lol
Cant blame him for using ur shower
mikey pls see moxie 2d 's vid its awesome he did such a good job
Play more Minecraft Pokémon
You still want your snubs
Enjoy the break!!
He did it again
19:15 I know you saw it
Is no one gonna talk about Dartoad's dex at 19:13?
anyone noticed the meme that has jaiden that they spelled kyogre into KYo-geR and we will miss u mikey ur not burning out, but we WILL MISS U Grunty Boy too dont forget about him
Best of luck man!  A bit of advice for the creative burnout (or its potential I guess) but don't be afraid to do some non Pokémon content every now and then. I've seen other YouTubers I love dip their toes into some other things they like while still focusing on the content their channel is known for and it would really help. Don't quit doing Pokémon though, I love your content! Again, best of luck with everything!
Why did grunty boi put shampoo on his hat
Pleas react to terminal montage's Pokémon battle royal video's.
I have a request  Can I join Team Sky
I think itll be and better refreshing for a pokemon game not to bring back previous gen mons and only have the newest ones nor regional mons.
Man im so happy Michael has grew over the years. I have been a huge fan since 100k!, I really miss the pokemon talk it was really funny back them i really used to share them to my friends and we always created our own Pokemon because we were so inspired by Michael's Pokemon Designs. Ah Good Ol' Days
Turo park has a tree named turo and sada park has a tree named sada
Hope you enjoy you break Mikey <3
fun fact : if spoink stops bouncing he dies
Why Michael
so judging based off of one of the memes... if some people say arseus instead of arceus... and the arc phone exists...    do they call it the arse phone
Lockstin made a fakemon called worcane  Edit. Take off as much time as you need. I want videos that you care about, not that you need to post
Red pill all day long
I’ve been avoiding Pokemon like the plague because I didn’t want legends Arceus spoiled and we get A NEW GAME and I had absolutely NO IDEA, I’m currently ditching my no-spoilers attitude
Stopped watching mandjtv  Comes back because I miss watching him He says he’ll stop uploading Emotional damage Hope to see you uploading again soon see ya ✌️
I hope you’re okay because you’re my favorite pokemon youtuber
Do more Pokémon character team videos
1:58 if it's not 100% accurate it's 50% accurate
I want Poketalk >:(
Take good care of yourself, you do deserve a really good breather  Love your videos and content, will wait for your return until then again take care and Hail Yeah from France
Holy cow I just re-found this channel and I'm so happy. And almost 2m subs! Dang! Also, hope your eyes feel better!
P.s. sorry for being late to the comments
Thank you for letting us know that you won’t be posting for a while and I want to help any way I can. See ya soon. Oddish#14
I leave for a few months and now he has a beard     (Edit)  Grunty boy still has his iconic squeaky voice lol
SEXY SHOWER SCENE OMG SO AMAZING AND HOT GRUNTY BOI WITHOUT SHIRT AND SHAMPOO ON HIS HAT           HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Thought you were going to quit youtube
sky DIO said u should take a break also nice vid
Isn't Professor Kukui a school teacher in the Anime?
Bro the intro led right into the theme song for this series. By that I mean, it had the same tempo the whole intro
My last name is Maple and boy am I sad we never got a professor with that name.
At 7:43 Raise your hand if you forgot that they named the fat child “Sophocles”.
Moxie2D made a video of him remaking your pokemon
3:36 all my homies simp for kukui
Mikey idk why u thought ur Reddit banner was 33% accurate it’s 50% accurate
Do you want to see a draing
Ray ray raycwas
hope you like it
yeah mikey deserves a break and all but lets atalk about mikey taking a bath for a sponsor 5/5
I, and I hope many others, fully support you and wish you luck for the break. Don't try and rush take your time because we care about you, your mental health, etc. I noticed the uploads were getting slower and was worried for you so I'm glad to have some light shed on the situation, we love you Mikey!
He he it is i grunty gal PS I’m actually a boy I just made stupid
Please don't be dark type racist (sorry for being mean 😔
Enjoy your well deserved break!
Hello Mikey. Is there any way that I can contact you?
It's name is basically "the chonk"
14:46 name it orphan
Lechonk is perfection Pig-ified
2:00 I think he means 50%
Take your time, get the time off you need and we will be here waiting for your return to welcome you back.
You totally deserve this break! We’re all going to miss you for sure but we can always rewatch you older content. Enjoy your sabbatical, get plenty of rest and I’m sure you’ll come up with a great idea for your channel!
Wait a second... Who is grunty boi going to promote cool things to now.
Have a great break!
I honestly love your content and hope that this break will help you make content that will make you have fun too, and maybe it will be even better, hope you enjoy it😁
Enjoy your break you deserve it and can't wait to see you when you get back
Exscuse me they forgot someone 4:10 where is ball guy
11:07 no, no, they DO have a point, have u seen the amount of karens and florida men?
Pls play pixelmon
Take a break Mikey you definitely deserve it there’s no question or doubt about that. Play some other games or go on hikes you just do you and unplug
I was not expecting another “sexy shower montage” in the middle of Pokémon meme review, a surprise to be sure but a welcome one.
I just got my first random wild shiny yesterday. It was a shiny Bunneary I caught in the Grand Underground in Shining Pearl.
dont worry MandJTV we understand ur workout. take a month- heck maybe even more than a year if it satisfies you. i wish u the best :>
I'm honestly glad he shared his feelings. Everyone needs a break. Going to buy a jacket and t shirt.
Hopefully Mikey comes back clean shaven. Never liked his beard (though I must say his is way better than Plurplecliffe's)
Time stamp: 8:17 Yea the trailer for the game literally comfirms that it is not arseus
We all understand, you have been working really hard these past few years so its ok that your taking a veeeeeery well deserved break
It’s always good to take breaks! We all support you and will be ready to see more content once you get back!
It's good to know when to take a break. It's definitely better than you working yourself into a breaking point and quitting completely.  Have you considered asking the fan base for specific ideas? Maybe you could add a tag for that in your Subreddit, or give that option to your patrons. ASPITPIAY clearly shows that you have very creative fans who like to contribute.
Hello we know you need a break go ahead btw hail yeah!!!
Enjoy your break. I hope you recharge, and figure out what you need too, but also have some fun while you're at it. Just remember that all of us support your decisions and love your videos. You have no idea how excited I am when I see a new video from you. It truly makes my day. And I'm sure it does for so many others. Have a great break
Mike: it’s only 33.33% correct  Me: so it’s 50% correct
You should name it orcal (4,200
thx for the funny video, love it, if you need vacation etc... is understanable we are all humain ^^"
It would be cool if psyduck got a new regional style in the new gen 9
Lmao the shampoo on the hat
oh btw im Spanish and these are what the name of the starters mean Fuecoco: Fire crocodile spigatito: spring kitten Quaxly just a mixture of words to spell quack
No mandjtv
I have a new challenge for you the rules are the first pokemon you see you have to catch and if it dies you have to replace it with the next pokemon you catch if both it and your starter dies game over  and you can sole link it as well
*puts soap on hat
Ok, first off I am sorry this comment has come so late. but I can understand where you are coming from, as I really enjoyed the From then to now Type videos and noticed a severe drop off on how they were released. I look forward to hopefully seeing the rest of the types released after your break to finish the series before GEN IX comes out
I think he wanted an excuse to do the shower montage
Listen it’s perfectly fine your taking a break you have worked hard you earned it
Can you do more team sky
love ya dude. heres hoping you enjoy every second of your time off!
in some world lechonk is called oinxypoixy
It's great ur taking a break Mikey. I know u always try to get content out to us
Too many spoilers. I skipped so much and I don’t know if I missed anything good. I loved the fake mons people
I’m straight but that sexy shower montage makes me question everything
You take all the time you need. Your health comes first. We will still be here when you decide to come back. Your health and wellbeing is more important to us then your videos. Look after yourself and see you when you get back.
Michael used to be a trainer like us, but then he took a hoodie to the eye.
ah crap im seduced by grunty boi
im glad im living alone if my parents would come in at the szene where grunti boi takes a shower i would have to explane it somehow
Just hope you'll be back before November. 😉   Enjoy your break!
Take as long as you need :)
grunty boi: *causally washes hat instead of hair*
Can u do a new pokemon go video plzz and I love ur video
6:18 grungy boi thirst trap
Mikey was the 696th upvote to glassycolors post. I see this as an absolute win (15:45)
As one of your fans, I just wanted to say you’ve earned this. I don’t know if you’ll ever see it, but I am sorry you got to this point. My favorite videos of yours were always the ones where you seemed to be having the most fun or when you were the most excited. To hear that you’ve lost that a little is sad to me. Please take the time you need. The fans will be here whenever you get back.
Hey Mikey! Just watched your video! If you ever need help script writing or editing, feel free to reach out to your community! I’m sure there are a lot of talented people willing to help you make your videos!  P.S. Have fun on your break😊!
You die for the mom
100% Smoliv best Pokémon this Gen. Literally the main reason I’m gonna buy the games is because of it. Also I hope the shiny looks really cool so I want to full-odds shiny hunt it.
Excuse me MNJ TV you don’t know how good she danger is remember I can only get hit by special I mean physical at to speak so if you’re fighting against special attack you you
Should totally react moxie2D he did a video redrawing and adding dex to all your pokemon
bro i just used random pokemon generator and i got mega sceptile, lol
Please don't stop I love your vidos but if you stop please don't delete your YouTube Chanel because it makes my bad Days really good and happy
The Platypus fakemon shiny variation looks like Crazy Diamond from JJBA
watch moxie2d's video
I liked LECHONK before its name was reaveld
I support your choice Mikey I get it
Orcollin
When Michael says greetings pokefans the subtitles turn into greetings boogie fans. And if you watch "things in Pokemon that make no sense" the greetings pokefans turn into "eating Swiggy pants" if you have the subtitles on. Have a good vacation Michael.
Enjoy your break 👍
I know you hate Nuzlocks, but we haven't seen one from you in a lot of time and I think it would be funny to see you do one it can be funny if u do a hard-core one😅😂
Lechonk is inspired by lechon in philipines when we cook pigs its lechon the super tasty  skin so cryspy and the suace mmmm
What happened with you and jack?
I will never know if you read this but I love you’re videos I noticed how constant they have become and started to wonder how you did it without burning out but enjoy your vacation and it will bring joy when you return
Mikey for secret celebrity drag race confirmed
Good, take some penguin time for mental health
11:00 I don't get the joke
My first ever shiny was random that night I had a dream I got a shiny phsyduck
I’m happy you want to take a break so you dont burnout completely and quit YouTube I love your videos but I think a lot can agree your mental health matters more can’t wait to see you come back
This is a sad day for me, waking up and theres no more mnj uploads for a while. Best of luck for your month off my man You shall be missed till you get back
I don’t care about people taking breaks
RIP 🙏 MANDJTV it is definitely hard to playthrough pokemon games constantly with no break, to deadlines. I miss your old content like random issues with gym leaders ect.  It's easy to burnout I think purplecliffe is going the same way.
Shiny subway
Da pigs
Yes da baby pokemon
Are u okay but amazing vid I will never unsub
Have u saved a blStoises recently?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOURE NOT MAKING YOUTUBE VIDEOS ANYMORE?!?!?!?!?!!! :(
A way to move forward......why not create your own region, using TEAM SKY as the main villians? You could collab with other poketubers like truegreen 7 (design) hoops&hippop (music) etc. Could also suggest to Gamefreak to make it a real game - could evolve your channel
It's sad that pokemon fans make better designs than the payed designers for pokemon
you totally deserve a break mikey!
what about the docter squatch trading soap game?
I'll take a different approach. Absolutely: do what you need to do for yourself and your well-being.  ...I could tell something was up. As a "viewer," I just didn't enjoy the videos on the main channel as much anymore and I did unsubsubscribe.  I say that not as a critique but to say that I'm probably not alone and other viewers would probably get there too. It's not even good for your business to push like that when you're creating.  So I'm glad you're doing something about it more actively. If any YouTubers decides to quit, by all means. This mess ain't life. And being a channel focused on one gaming media (mostly the games) makes it even harder.  I'd rather you do something else entirely, whether I enjoy it or not, and be happy and make the living you want than to push out videos you or I aren't thrilled about.  Take 3-4 months if you can.  I and other viewers like me will peek back in. Take care.
Hey enjoy your time off! You will be missed ! Im gonna try to complete my pokedex in sword to get the shiny charm to cop some shinies and I would say enjoy your time again and maybe get some workouts in or try something new like Boxing or Jiu Jitsu! have fun and enjoy life, im a big fan of your work!
you could do pixelmon again. thats fun
How dareth you separate froakie and Rowlet
I will miss you come back soon the longer it takes for you to come back the longer it takes for you to get views from me
Bro everyone needs a break
he’s mad please know he is mad and you are such a jerk if you don’t talk to purple cliff
why dont you and jack talk anymore?!
Hey Mikey can you tell me something why don’t you ever talk to purple class anymore that’s really rude and by the way I like your videos but can you do something nice for once he’s going through stress right now and he is getting bullied by a shot so can you do something nice for him because you know why he’s mad and he just said on his new lifestream that he does not talk with you anymore so come on
Can you rank of who is the best 1st,2nd all the way thru 8th gym leaders?
Mikey I hope you have a great break and are able to relax and rest. Thank you so much for your videos. We’re so thankful for you and it’s great that you’re taking time for yourself. Good luck and have fun.
I think my favorite thing about Lechonk is not his name but the fact that he is just all muscle. Lechonk swole
I understand your struggle, I deal with it too sometimes and it’s brought me through burnout so I’ve decided to take a break for it
Just when I got back into Mikey’s channel 😭😭😭 it’s all good. We all need a break now and again! Hope you find the peace you’ll need! Can’t wait for you to get back
This is no longer aspitypi this lechonk review
Just give your Chanel to Grunti boi anf Grunti boi will upload videos :)
I’ve played Pokémon for 15 years and I’ve never gotten a shiny encounter besides the lake of rage guaranteed shiny 😢
Can Mikey please put his thing in dark mode instead of light mode because this hurts my eyes but love the content
Hey dude take care of yourself <3 Its all about listening to what your brain is trying to tell you, and trying to fix it. Hope it helps :)
Mikey will you keep being in PM7 videos and challenges
Don’t worry Mikey, you won’t harm too many people if you upload slowlier. We all understand, and can tide ourselves over with other creators and/or your pre existing videos.
Mikey you deserve this break from YouTube. Take as long of a break as you need. Just please come back unlike pokemon talk.
sad noises
hey Mikey I don't know if you will read this but I hope you do because i missed the event with Mitey and even if i was able to get it im a kid and we have different currency here and well 1 dollar is 50 of our currency here so are the mitey plushies gonna be in stock during november because that is my bday so that i can ask somebody for it as a gift if you ship worldwide of course so i hope you read this and if you did thank you
Imagine my parents would have walked in during that shower montage
Take as much time as you need, we all understand
Instead of sensuqlly walking over to the thermostat we are sensually putting shampoo on a hat
Magiraffe has the rinnegan
Have a nice break mikey
hey Michael, no matter what I will always love this channel and if you feel you need a break then have one i will always be subbed.             please take as long as you like off.
The quadruped starter design looked like garbage. People need to shut their trap already about this stupid Karen like outrage and move on. Every quadruped redesign always looks like trash
Me at the start: *Gasps*  ARE U GETTING MARRIED!!!???!?!? 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
That platypus fakemon looks oddly like Platypet and Platox from Temtem.

Everyone’s talking about his break. But like THE WINK OF GRUNTY BOI!!! AHHHHHHH!!!

I'd be down to take Oak, Birch, Sycamore, and Kukui's classes. Also, I think it's cool that they always have Pokemon related subjects. Oak being the basis, Elm breeding, Birch ecology, Rowan evolution, Juniper forms and seasons, Sycamore Megas, Kukui Move/Z-Moves, Magnolia/Sonia D-Max/G-Max.
This break was probably for the best. And I mean it's not like he's quiting YouTube forever.
when  saw the snom i thought about the needle felted fuecoco i made
i hope that you dont look toooooo different when you come back
I laughed so hard of grunty bois sexy shower montage
Just got my Mytey plushie today, it's so adorable
More thirst traps
'pigpig' is more of a digimon name if u ask me LOL. i mean, there's a digimon named gatomon for crying out loud!
I have a question for grunty boi, do you know Jessie, James and meowth?
Thx for the effort
Only thing with the doomoose dex entry is that we already have a pokemon that is thought to bring disaster, Absol.
Take the break you need my guy
😭😭😭😭 I’m gonna miss you Mikey, but do what you need to feel better!!!!
Proud of you. You will be missed but you absolutely deserve it
Goodbye Mikey!
why is Midori there in 15:57 ?
I can only imagine how many grunty boi memes will come out of THIS video
We love you Mike have a good break we will see you later
2:00 so its 50% accurate grade?  (idc if like 50 people probably said this already i'm saying it too)
It would be cool if you made a villain version for your Castform replacement it would have the power to gain forms based around other villains to try to defeat the hero for example for that cave form you talked about it could turn into a joker form that could make loud laughing sounds that would disrupt mighty’s sense of herring but this Pokémon is now decked out in vibrant colors making it easy for your Pokémon to spot the joker thing is a reference to Batman because caves have bats in them it would get forms by biting in to mighty in one of mighty’s forms and get new forms from the mighty but every form has a disadvantage also I forgot how to spell your Pokémon’s name so I am going to say mighty instead and the two types of villains it can form into are villains from films and villains from video games and I want this Pokémon I’am making is gonna be a king cobra also i’am a realy big fan
OH F#$k I'm g4y now. 6:19
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo
Cameraman during the sexy shower montage...
E
Take your time bud! And yes add the goggles lol
Oh mikey I love you mate,  haven't watched you for a while because been busy with college for the last year but now I'm glad to have some time off and get back into the pokemon community
Bro rest up, enjoy that time, even if it's just sitting down and chill with no thoughts. Hope this recharges you and things get in order for ya in the house. Found you due to my friends recommendation, so thank you for the videos and honestly guess I missed that you were not burned out. But take any time you need and sorry for the late message.
Please rest and take a break. You're among my fave PokéTuber. It'll be a great loss if you get burned. We'll wait patiently. 🧡
17:37 I actually hate this.
I had an idea for a video! When the new Pokémon Games come out, could you tell us which one is better like with the other games? Like the previous video where you told us which Pokémon game was better, you should do it with the new games as well! Just an idea! 😊
You look like and sound like jacksepticeye
You could do the worst idea ever and let jack or John run the channel while your gone
See you soon Mikey :))
Bruh, I take a break on YouTube videos and my most watched channel is taking a break D: . Although he does deserve a vacation.
Buhuuu cant do the same thing everyday,...did u ever do a normal job ? there u do the same thign every day too...u make me sick
thats not called burn out, thats called: i got enough money from u guyz so I can take a break and come back whenever i want and lose nothing
Why has grunty boi and mikey gone from enemys, to frenemys/rivals and now to an old married couple who bicker all the time.
Hey at least tour banner is 50% accurate
Completely understandable
Take as long of a break as you think you need, Mikey. Everyone deserves one now and then and you’ve been working your butt off with everything going on with both of your channels. I’m glad you’re taking burnout seriously and I hope you enjoy your time away from YouTube.
Dude I've been following you since the beginning, way back in 2014, you've helped me through some tough times, but yeah, you never take a break. Screw anyone who's not happy with it, you more than deserve it man
I completely understand why you want to take a break from this, besides we would never want you to be burned out
18:35 WHAT IS THIS SLANEESHI ABOMINATION!?!??!?! BROTHER, GET THE HEAVY FLAMER
Pokemon eye review
its called the ark phone so its aceus or arkoos. me who reads it arseus: oh fu-
Enjoy the sabbatical good sir. You've more then earned it
Take all the time you need
moxie re drew them all
Aw man ill watch past vids while waiting u
Nooooo Mikey I'm going to miss your videos you always make my day whyy but it's okay you should rest god bless
react to moxie2d drawing your pokemon
Why did Grunty Boy put the shampoo on his hat? lol
Hey MandJTV. I don't know if you have been told or not, but another youtube channel has stolen your ASPITPIAY theme. Like the theme is exactly the same, same beat and everything, just changed the words, but it is still very clearly your theme. The youtuber is AttorneyTom. His video, "forgetting evidence is part of the job (Reddit Reacts)" has the theme in the first 20 seconds of the video.
Mikey- Orcane Me- Or. arcanine. Orcanine
MOXIE2D created much better art for your newly drawn pokemon
This video is sponsored by dr squatch It’s WHAT
Really speaks to his ability as a content creator that he still makes such good content even when really feeling pressured and burned out.  I hope he's able to get refreshment and a better idea of how to proceed with his break. Sounds like he really needs this.
Great way to make a final video before a break, hope you enjoy your break!
I hope we get the then vs now video's back because I really liked those and it's a shame you stopped with them
Im happy hes taking a break, he has been making amazing content for years, and he finally gets the break he deserves, I hope you make the most of it!
3:59 No they’re not all “chilling” their mourning their friend spoink’s death.
I hope everyone is ok with your break, you deserve it as you post high quality videos every single week with few exceptions. I hope you enjoy your time off and I hope having a time off helps create fun new video ideas!
Doomoose should be an evolution from Deerling in the Kaskade region. It should be able to evolve if it levels up while having learnt a Dark type move and a Blood Moon is in effect.
Goodbye for now Mikey rest well you deserve it
Mikey's Orcane is better than the Rivals of Aether's Orcane.
Enjoy your break Mikey you have definitely earned it
its not canon that grunty bois hat is apart of him
thoes who have plyed hollow knight, cosmoth hits too blose to home
When you come back you could try having a goal of 2 mil subscribers before scarlet and violet’s release. I think you could do it and I certainly subbed
how is the shower scene allowed by youtube, that is my only question
Take the brake you deserve it
16:29 u can see squirtle in the background in the last page
Always good to take a break, Mikey.
14:33 i thought you were gonna mention Warcane, the Lockémon
Nice mike you need only some break sometimes
Hey Mikey Is Manjtv meant Michael  And John Tv
I just realized I have been subscribed for 9 years and I’m 15
We love you and you can take all the time you need to recoup! YouTube seems like an intense job and also really hard best of luck!! 💛💙💛💙
14:34 Wait is this orcan- hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  so I wasn't the only one who thought that
I noticed that their are small cuts in the video why is that(just curious)
You deserve a vacation  I'll be here when you get back
I am the Charizard good receipt we don't need any more Charizard stop with the charizards game free I know what you going to try to put stuff we don't need more charizards
i want a video where all MandJTV Characters Just argue
Mental health is always #1. I love you're channel & content bro! Can't wait to see you come back refreshed & energized again!
Totally unrelated but do you plan on ever releasing team sky merch again? I'm sure there's a reason it was limited time only but I'm planning on doing a run in brilliant diamond as a team sky admin and would love to get some merch
Is ur eye ok😶
My first random shiny in Shield was a Golurk I accidentally ran from 🥲  I spent the next two days breeding a shiny Golett to even the scales
Grunty Boy may not be the channel mascot but on the other hand he absolutely is
I love smoliv WAY more than lechonk
This man is a professional
We understand Mikey, you enjoy ur break and have fun
" I was gonna say the sexy shower montage, but close enough" - Grunty boi
Hey man you have given us some great stuff and we will be thrilled to keep watching in a few months when you've had a nice breck. You deserve it. Also I know that I like you enough if you want to do something different I'd watch that to. New Digimon game coming out this month. Lot's of weird free indie games on steam. I'd watch you let's play anything really. You have the following to do random fun stuff and still get lots of views. Looking forward to whatever you feel like doing when you get back.
Mikey: Keep those at the Pokemon Centers! The machine that can literally bring 6 pokemon, no matter the species, back to life: Am I a joke to you?
good luck with your break mikey
look after you my dude we'll be here x
Fun fact Muk is doing the middle finger
Gotta say, the first redesigns of Mikey’s fakemon look so much like Neopets that it’s startling
Alright Mikey, take a break. You've been working non-stop and we can't thank you enough. Let's hope that Mandjtv will live on forever. Without you, content for pokefans is not a lot (depending on who u are). So take a rest and let's hope you can return.
Im am sad but i bet he needs it
Take all the time you need. Looking forward to the comeback with more amazing content!
You do you boo
It’s so funny that grunty boy breaks in Mikey’s house and uses his shower and Mikey doesn’t even get mad
Grunty boy pls never change lol
OMG gunty boy!!! i'm dying laughting here 😁😁😁💖
No one: Me: dying of laughter at the Grunty Boy shower montage
An alternate name for Mikey's Orcane could maybe be Orcra ? Also Mikey, don't worry about us. We'll keep ourselves busy 👌
Lol Gunty Boi pouring shampoo onto his hat! Enjoy your sabbatical Mikey!
Enjoy your time away! You definitely have a new subscriber to your other channels in me! We love you!!
Don’t you mean the banner is 50% accurate
Lol
I need help on pokemon go
More like "Blind Pokemon Meme Review" 😐
The shampoo on the hat almost made me choke on my food
Can I just comment on how chesnaught on all four looks so good. my second favorite animal is the pangolin and it really looks like a pangolin and I've always wanted to like chesnaught but nothing really got me to like it a lot.
I hope you get better from your burn out I love your content I really want to see the day you come back to YouTube
I choose the purple pill
i found a random shiny drowzee in my play through of ultra sun last week
You definitely deserve a break, so take all the time you need. Selfishly, I hope you come back clean-shaven again. I kind of miss the look.
also enjoy the break.
i was posting pokemon for my fakemon region on the subreddit and the modarader removed it that tells me either i art is trash and did not put effort in to it or something wrong with it that i dont know. quote "Low effort/low quality content, content that is "iterative", or content that is commonly overdone are subject to removal at moderator's discretion". which hurt me as an artist.
Do what you need to do we all have you back and you need
take care of yourself and enjoy your break, you need it!
man, ig i shouldn't get that hoodie cause it might kill me
THE SHOWER WINK.... it was super effective
NOT ANOTHER GRUNTY BOI SHOWER MONTAGE… ok, it’s pretty funny
Gronty boy more like grunty bad boy
Please enjoy your break! Your fans and I will be patiently waiting for you to come back. We all love you.
It's ok, Mikey, burnout is real and can really kill your passion, take your well earned vacations!
I just choked on air when grunty boy started the montage
Nooooo Mikey won't post for at least a month I am so sad
The quadrupeds actually look awsome... the regular ones... not so much... Intelleon i like but not as much as the quadruped version
Orcana instead as in Arcana
You moved you say well I guess we have to say what the F happened to the floor
YouTube captions : hi there boogie fans my eye still stings and welcome to the newest episode of ass Peter pie
you sound like the guy in the vhs tape from poppy playtime chapter 2
Take care Mikey hope you have fun on your break you deserve it
Good luck Mikey (aka Mickey)! Can’t wait to see what the future brings!
Appreciate your honesty at the end! Your fans are here for YOU. Even if that means you need to take time off, you’re not letting us down, you’re taking care of yourself. 👍🏼👍🏼😊
Orcane 😐, Orcool👌😎👍
u deserve a break man take care whie ur gone, looking forward to ur return
1:59 Well, if it's not 100% accurate, it's 50% ;)
If you think about it husui is gen 9
Who just now realized that Koraidon has webbed feet?
Me when grunty boy was taking a shower 📸📷📸📷📸📷📸📷
Take as long as you need my dude, you inspire me so much and you deserve some rest
Well I respect a man taking a break for his own mental health so good luck and enjoy your break.
michael does a suspiciously good impression of grunty boy...🤨
You take your time to be you, brother 🤘 I did notice you saying stuff like "If I did another Team Sky video, it'd probably be Legends Arceus" and you were very... unenthused? About Team Sky?? So now that definitely makes sense, I can't blame u at all. Take your time, take care of your life, but most importantly, take care of yourself
All the best Mikey, I only found your content at the start of lockdown but I feel like it's changed my life. I've rwatched the metronome black and white series over at least 2 times and even watched back to the teamlocke that caused you psychological trauma! But you have given us an amazing 2 years of back to back blockbuster videos, you deserve time to recharge and find your love again! Looking forward to seeing some Instagram posts with a big ol smile on yo face!
Everyone needs some vacations/rest. Be safe and be happy Mikey.
Best of rest and other IRL stuff for you, Mikey! See you next time <3
You deserve to have a break! You make great videos and i understand it takes a lot of work
Take the time you need you yourself are more important than the biz. If you feel like coming back I will enjoy your videos again :)
Me the moment i see Squatch: CLOSE YOUR EYES CLOSE YOUR EYES!
Enjoy your vacation! Everyone neds a mental health break every now and again. I enjoy your videos and only wish for you to still have fun making them and not feel as if they are a chore.
It’s boogie fans this month
Am I the only one who had a heart attack when grunty boy used shampoo on his hat?
Take your time❤️ We'll be here when you're ready to get back to making videos. Take your time to sort everything out❤️
The bathroom with the hat made me laugh
Wounder if he’s still considered the hottest poketubber
bro take you a vacation and unwind and deal with your home life. we will be here when you get back
Gruntie boy Puts shampoo on his hat
Your such a good content creator and your basically my entire childhood I know it’s sad to see you go but knowing that you’ll be back is great! I’ve been here since your first ever pokemon talk episode and we all kept supporting you since then, cya dude 😊
Just take a break and use your vacations for new ideas
No please dont leave us
Grungy boi putting shampoo on his hat nearly made me burst out in laughter on the bus 😂😂
Gotta take care of yourself first and foremost. Your health if the most important thing. Mental and Physical. Take all the time you need, we shall await your grand and glorious return!
I'll miss u
Take all the time you need! Every single person needs time to them self (for self care and personal stuff).
shave ya hethan🤭
I love you and your videos
We love you Mikey!!! Take your time to rest. You are like a pokemon game, we don’t mind to wait for you because you are gonna be amazing when you came back <3
You deserve your break!
Take care and your pokéfans shall be here upon your return. Ta taaa!!!
It's gonna be a long month and a half without Mikey content, but personal and mental health is always more important in this type business.
WHY TF DID GRUNTY BOI WINK AT ME ALSO WHY DID I LIKE IT WHEN HE WINKED AT ME
Anyone realized that grunty boy actually applied the shampoo...onto his hat?
I feel like the only viewer that sucks at drawing worse then Mikey
damnnnn, please take the cap off, heh
will miss you man. hope when ya come back ya feel better
Have a great break I hope your ok
This is hilarious! PS Have a nice break!
Take as long as you want to take a break I'll be here when you come back
We love you so much, Mikey. Enjoy your break!!!
…I-I now how a major crush on Mikey
Mikey should totally be a voice actor; he has such range.
Sorry for the late comment, but dude everyone needs a break hope you have a good time. All us fans will be here whenever you get done no matter how long. You shouldn't feel any pressure about making content, you know why you started your channel and that's what matters. Have fun buddy and we'll see you whenever you get back
Mickey so that is only 30% accurate me so it's 50% accurate sorry this is the first time I've done this  type of comment
Sorey Mikey gotta disagree, Chesnaught and Incineroar don't look right as quadrupeds
Take all the time you need i can wait for your great content
I hope you enjoy your break. Your content always fulfills us so I hope you van finally fulfill yourself
I hope the new multiplayer will be good and I hope you have fun with it so you can make videos
Have fun with your mini vacation Mikey!
Well, people have vacations for something. Enjoy the timeoff and have fun
I respect the decision at the end And I will be looking forward to your return. But a fun video idea that I think you might would like to do is something like what shady penguin did where they combine Pokémon together just saying.but great video Mikey!
My friend has a geometry dash YouTube channel called Cosmoth. Be prepared for him to sue.
my favorite pokemon is snom and i love 3d sewing so when i saw it i fell in love with it
Nooooo please don’t go we need the vids THE VIIIIIIIDDDDSSSSS!
Love the drawn made-up pokemon post!
I think you should name it Orcrill the ?hands? looks like drills and its an orca
So in other words, Mikey's taking a vacation.  Have fun man, everyone deserves a break at some point.
Wrong it’s not 33% accurate it’s 50% accurate because if it’s not 100% accurate it’s 50% accurate
Nobody: Grunty Boi: sexy shower time
Wait a minute, j just realized Mikey and Grungy Boi grew a beard at the same time. Coincidence? I think not!
It makes sense to take a break for a month right now. Especially since who knows what sort of content the Pokemon company may release about gen 9 in that time, so that could help with getting new ideas/inspiration. Enjoy your sabbatical ^.^
Your mental health is important. Take care of yourself and we'll be here when you get back. I have thoroughly enjoyed your vids. Both on here and your plays channel. Hope you come back recharged and ready to rock.
6:21 My penis just shrunk by 2 inches.
Orca
i want pokemon talk back
i live off of this
man thanks
Mikey look at moxie  2d's video on your fakemons
Oh my go… WHY DID YOU DO THAT GRUNTEY BOY?!
Take your time, the true fans will be here when you get back.  Edit - I LOVE THAT LEOPOWD I WANT TO CUDDLE IT
DUDE I HAVE THAT TOWEL! POKÉMON TOWEL BROS 4EVA
I may lose my account (I dont think so) but I will always be looking for your comeback :D (sad)
Grunty Boi in Mikey's shower is the closes thing to a house tour we're getting and I'm fine with that!
Hope it goes well! You won’t find purpose without Jesus! Don’t forget it!
I fell in love with Lechonk before I saw the name. XD
do what you have to. can't wait to watch you play through Pokemon Violet and or Scarlett.
Those fakemon designs on reddit look so cool I will miss you and you making videos I really enjoyed them. Also I didn't know that you moved.
1:35 MIKEYYYYY NOOOOO I NEED YOU
17:34 Is it just me or does this not feel right at all?
Hey Mikey I hope this reaches you in some way I jus want to say I wish you a wonderful and restful sabbatical and know that we love you and your channels
Maybe after your break you can make a big return by bringing back Pokémon talk
next ep mikey's wearing an eye patch
Orcon
Wish your time away keeps your sanity buddy. Love your content. Keep smiling!
On the Pixelmon video you did you cheated I think you're a bad person for it and I hope you subd your toe every day of your life for the rest of your life
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo but have a good break!!
good luck mikey i hope your channel continues to grow {did i spell mikey wrong}
Do what you need to do Mikey!
waaaahhh. Its okay that you are addressing this for your pokéfans and not disappearing all of a sudden unlike other content creators. Please take the break well and not to think that much of the content. I hope more cheerful fully charged Mikey would come back soon.
I hope you enjoy your Sabbatical
This isn’t goodbye it’s just a see you later
I actually noticed the fact about professors not being named after a tree. It's just not that important as lechonk
Enjoy your break Mikey. Much deserved and much love. Take as long as you need. We will always be here.
Wait, so is this a break from both channels or just the main channel? can someone please answer. thanks
The banner isn’t 33% accurate, because if it’s not 100% accurate, it’s 50% accurate
I do hope to see you back in time for Scarlet and Violet's release, but that gives you plenty of time. Either way, take all the time you need.
Cosmoth looks like the Radiance from Hollow Knight
Do more pokemon talks
Thanks Mike for all the great content enjoy your time off and come back with great content
WHRN TYPES THEN VS NOW ?
10:38 BLUE CAUSE CUNDAQUIL
what if the arc phone is pronounced "arse" phone
6:17 i...i... I lost....
is your dark type called doomoose cause its a mix of doom and moose?
I respect you I understand a brake.
That Spoink one is surprisingly dark.
My first (and only) shiny I caught was a random abomasnow in the wild area, coincidentally it is also my first abomasnow ever I just saw it while walking by and thought "isnt he supposed to be green?"
Rest well Mikey your health is most important after all
Enjoy your time off. Rest and relax. You deserve it!
1:58 its actually 50%
the second magiraffe had a rinnegan
Orcalamity
Everyone needs a break now and then, im glad you're taking burnout seriously.  I excitedly await your return for scarlet and violet content. 💜
:( :( :( :( Mikey don’t leave
It's OK Mikey, you take all the time you need. Love your content!
2:00 if not 50% accuret its 100% accurate
Hi, I’m a time traveler from the future, and when mikey plays Pokémon cloud he finds a shiny a-
1:58 If it not 100% accurate it's 50% accurate Everyone liked that
MIKE PLZ NOTICE  I want to mention that I think terrakidd evolves into terrakion!
Amazing how Mikey and grunty boi are so in sinc, they even grew beards at the same time.
Hey Michael, I hope you will get your rest and fun back making this videos! Only want to tell you that you make me laugh since the very beginning of your carrière as Poketuber and hope you will never stop doing this. Every week i'm waiting for a new video of yours and now I'm gonna wait for you dude. Take your time, a big fan from the Netherlands. Sorry for my bad English 😃
hey buddy.  You don't need to be so hard on yourself.  Take all the time in the world that you need.  You are a very talented and creative person and I have loved almost everything you have done.             But we all need breaks from time to time.   Just have some fun without having to think about "Which electric mouse has the highest bst" lol              i will still be here as I love your content.  Take care of yourself and know that your fans love you.
You knew exactly what you were doing with that wink, and how dare you? 🤤🤤🤤
Already waiting for your return😁😁😁
The only reason i dont submit to pokemon meme review is because im bad at memes and self contious about my art so
Change orcanes name to Kilawhala pronounced "Keyla-Whale -a"
16:37 my favorite part :3  Also, Mikey In all seriousness, I know how you feel about the stress and burnout you've been having lately and you won't be posting for a while. there are some reasons why, and i understand, and i look forward to if we see you again in the future. so for now, all I will say is to take that time to let yourself recharge, and do whatever you need to do. take as much time as you need :)  In the meantime, we viewers will enjoy some of your past content you've made  we love you Mikey :)
And i did watch that video of you and John that was a sweet capture
I haven’t watched you in so long, you have a beard now! I feel super old
Another banger, another banger shower montage by Grunty Boi
I am sad you are taking a break but I understand YouTubers are people but your content always makes me look forward for the next video  Edit: bathroom reveal Lmao
I have a question I haven't seen you purplecliffe and pokemen in a long time did you guys split?
dont change Orcane! it sounds like the Norwegian word for hurricane, "orkan", which is extra epic
go enjoy ur break bro, you deserve it for posting so frickin consistently for years. come back whenever you want, we'll wait for u <3
I think YouTubers need to develop a culture where taking a couple of weeks off each year is the norm. Every other job I know of takes a break each year. I wish YouTubers would start doing this to better take care of their mental health.  Enjoy your break Mikey! I hope you feel better ❤️
I want to find a shiny subway now or Subway
Have a great break! You definitely deserve it.
Hey Mikey take as much time as you want and as you need I know how tiring content creation can be on all forms wether it’s art, music or videos and YouTube is kind of a shitshow right now so go ahead take a break and we’ll all be here when you get back. Stay safe, stay healthy and stay happy.
you deserve a break king <3. We are all here to support you!! We look forward to your return!! also, happy 4th of july <3
Orchaos
Petition to change it from Orcane to Or... We will work on it.
Mikey, if your subreddit’s social media information is not 100% accurate, it is 50% accurate.  Have a good break.
you are doing the right thing. after all, you are supposed to have fun too. take a well deserved break and spend some time for yourself.
reupload soon okay
When I inevitably play SV, I have been thinking what to name my Lechonk, as a legendary pig Pokémon deserves a legendary name attached to it, thus, I have decided to name it Technoblade  RIP King🐷❤️
I am possibly your biggest fan
Ever since I discovered your channel, I am immediately a fan. Not only bec of you being so hot (hottest PokeTuber) but also bec of ur contents and humor. To this day, I rewatch your facts videos, then vs now, revised teams for types or gyms, playthroughs, challenge vids with PM7, and many others. However, I understand the burnout. With you just narratine it, made me already feel the exhaustion that you've felt. I am also playing Pokemon wity my emulator and I cannot finish a single playthrough now ..  Take your time Sir Mikey. We'll wait for u and ur awesome vids soon.  Love from the Philippines. 😇
R.I.P mikey s eye cause of death stabbed by his hoodie doodie
I hope you see this. I would like to thank you, for all the videos you have made on both channels. They have helped me smile through some dark times. I hope you have a good break. You deserve it. I wish you the best. Get some rest, recharge, and recuperate. Take good care of yourself.
I think brawlive would be a good evo for smoliv
Take the break you need
completely understand go enjoy the break and hope to so the new content in the future.
Haha, love the second shower montage! Great video, Mikey, enjoy your break!
Wait what do you mean that was not the new jarrasic movie
Take care of your self Mikey
Grunty boi in the shower tho😂
Hey Mickey may I offer you a position to my Pokémon evil team, team plantis. You as the grass type gym leader of hoen region are an amazing candidate for the admin position for my team
There are actually trees that share the same names as the professors.
Nice
Now is the perfect time to take a break. You'll be back just in time for the new game to drop and for all the buzz around that. Then with some good SEO you'll be getting a boom in viewers anyway (hopefully) and will be reinvigorated for the ScarVi content. Have a nice break :)
It is I Grunty boy
I am going to be upset that you won't be posting but I understand why, enjoy your break mikey and I look forward to the next video
Smolive garden
I bought the M and J tee! Have a lovely break!
if you get bored from too much pokemon why domt do things on otehr game series? and make shorter videos so its less of a grind to get videos out?
Micheal....please sir ... Just a crumb sir...
dont worry it's normal to take a break
I just noticed what ASPITPIAY stands for
Hahaha it is I, Grunty boy! And I have stolen your Creative drive! If you want it back, you will need to take a break for a couple of months to refresh and reorganise.   Then you can return to your community who support you and adore your content.
It's OK Mikey and enjoy your break I can still watch your past vids and besides I can watch your team sky and other vids so overall have a nice break
We understand if you need to step back for a bit. We'd rather not have uploads for a while than you wind up not wanting to do this anymore. If and when you come back, I think a good idea for your plays channel would be a Team Sky video for Ultra Sun/Moon. There are a ton of good pokemon you can get for a Team Sky video on just the first island. In any case, we hope you enjoy your break and it helps you figure things out for yourself.
I can't use the Dr. Sq promo code again...weird
Take your time man, everyone will be excited for whatever you think is best for you whenever you get back
Hail yeah.....
I'll miss you and your videos, but I understand. Hopefully you return to us full of purpose and renewed vigor!
Take a break, the time doesn’t matter, just recover. And if you decide to return, let those brand deals is under your timeframe not theirs. If a week is too rushed let them know it will be ready in two weeks. I do commissions with a comfy time frame to avoid burn out
Hey I have that towel grungy boi had on!
Enjoy your break, king. You will come back swinging and better than ever.
Orcbane or orbane
I could see grunty bois nippies
Do you have any tips for stating a YouTube channel?
17:33 "I've never been a big chesnaught" Mikey 7/2/2022
Rip spoink
I got my first random shiny (lopunny) a few moths back with no charm.😐
Are you ok
SEXY SHOWER MONTAGE 2.0 YES
Grunty Boi's voice cracks: *infinite*
i feel this is a scam because the hoodie is *55 DOLLARS*
Mikey shower tour
Yo man take your time, even if its a year take your time,and enjoy yourself
Take your time, my dude! Love your content and can’t wait until your return!
I swear, if lechonk doesn’t evolve into a buff pig called lestronk, I am going to be VERY mildly displeased             the games are out now and lechonk did not evolve into lestronk but oinkologne is fine
Psst you got the stuff Yes you got the cash Yes now give it to me Oooooh yes this montage of grunty boi showering
Everyone needs a break sometimes! Enjoy it! We <3 you!
1:00
take as much time off. you 100% deserve the break. pls take time with yourself and all your loved ones!
All that art you made on a wim was re-created by someone named moxie and he made a videos about it they look good but there are some that aren't so good like this guy's in this video
can we talk about how needlessly erotic the shower montages are and how I'm all for it anyways 😂
have a good break. also get better
My first random shiny in sword and shield was a shiny bronzor wich is now a bronzong
I'm here for more pics of Mikey without his shirt on. Enjoy your break and hope you come back perkier then ever.
I think it's great that you're going on a sabbatical. You deserve it. I'm on a bit of a sabbatical myself as well.   I recently quit my McDonald's job because they kept sending me home early every day due to overstaffing issues even after only working 1-2 hours of my normally 9 hour shifts. The final nail in the coffin for me was when they refused to let me wash my hands after taking out the garbage and they sent me home when I tried to argue back about it.   Don't be afraid to extend your sabbatical if you need to. I'm likely going to be on subbatical until Mid September, so I might get to see your "phoenix content" once you're back to doing YouTube (I said Phoenix content because I'm sure you will rise from the ashes of your sabbatical and make great and amazing content afterwards that you are happy with because who wouldn't be happy with a Phoenix?).
*LE-CHONK*
17:25 it's not "better", it's worse
🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷
You’ve been awesome with the content and deserve a long rest.  I hope Lechunk brings peace to my our mind lol. Pumped to see you play Scarlet and Violet
Thanks!
Take a well deserved break, we will be here waiting when you get back.   For the future you have plenty of fans who would be happy to help if you need additional help making content whether its scripts, ideas or even playthrough challenges (each person does an hour then passes on the file to another user)
Mikey : social media banner on reddit is 33% accurate  Me : you know what that means… *smirks*   I don’t know how bad burnout is cause i never lived it fortunately, but i believe it’s pretty serious In any case, take care of yourself, that’s the most important Inspiration might come back after your break ! I wish for you to get better quickly and do what you love, no matter what it is ;)
6:17 ohh he knows what hes doing
All The Best For The Sabbatical and Wish You Will Come Back Pretty Soon and Will Be Here Again With Double The Power..! ✨✨ Love From India 🇮🇳💘
If you're looking at this Mikey you can name the orca Warca combining war, water and orca.
17:03 that was a good one  I just realized it was a slowking that got be headed
12:35 IS THAT THE FKING RADIENCE!!????
Disappointed my art of Jalemodo didn't make it up, but the other art looks so amazing. :D I'm sure us fans could handle a break, you've got so many videos and are crazily consistent. Have a great break!
please take care! we'll be here when you return!
19:15 lmfao that’s a interesting kind of Pokémon
Hello I am positivity, I hope you have a great day. I enjoy your content and hope you continue to make more thank you.
Well best wishes to you Mikey. I love ur content. Ur uploads encourage me. I pray you are refreshed and renewed upon ur return. Team Sky will be here waiting! Also may I suggest a new series upon ur return?  Top 10 video series for ur top 10 favorite Pokemon of each type? God bless u. Many blessings.
Mike there is a game named eternal emerald do u know what it has it has TEAM SKY!!
Have fun on your break! Those designs were really spectacular
I like how mikey is just totally chill with grunty boi now
aww man no mikey videos, i mean im sad but anything he wants to do, right? so mikey, im not sure if your seeing this, but well miss u! and i hope ur well!
broooo, why the merch gotta be limited, i wanted to buy them 15 years later *sadge*
oh goodness … grunty boi, please
Lechonk would work as ickpig also but I’m so glad we got lechonk
33% you mean 50% lol
Thing is my favorite animal is a pig so it was going to be up there fore me anyways
Rename Orcane to Tenaciorca. From Orca and Tenacious.
i found a wild shiny vanillite after two days playing sw/sh
"Not a threat to your safety unless you're stupid like I am"  Welp. Guess its a threat to my safety then.
Bye bye hope the break  is nice drink lots of water :> pls /e no get hurt or die
Mickey I hope you have fun on your break thanks for all the great videos!
I hope your brake goes good for you I will try to watch a video a day tell you come back
Check the top comments on whatever you got shiny Russiaram around first try
NOOO I was too slow! Everyone’s versions of your Pokémon designs looks awesome though :)  Enjoy your break Mikey, I 100% understand burnout as an artist and I have no idea how you’ve been this consistent on YouTube for this long
Please take as long as you need. I've been following you since at least 2015 and I would hate it if you get actually burn out. Take you time and take care 😄
what if two smeargles used sketch on each other would the sketch go on until one of them is put back in there pokeball
Dam grunty boy you been hitting the pewder gym?
You are brave.
I hope you enjoy your vacation!! You deserve it.
I just realized that aspitpiay stands for “at some point in the past, I asked you”
I’ve sensed this in several different “poketubers.” Take care of yourselves; self-maintenance is important! The fans existed before your channel, and we can exist while you rest. Taking a sabbath rest is good! Maybe make it part of every week ;)
Would Mikey play Ark:survival evolved if I told him that he could build a house on a flying dinosaur.
Dude, everyone experiences some form of burn-out in their lives. Trust me when I say that it is OKAY! Take a break, have fun, enjoy yourself! Arcoos knows that you have earned and deserved it!
Have fun on your break.  This is a threat
Have fun on your break Mikey, you definitely deserve it and we’ll all be here when you get back 😁
You 100% deserve this break, please enjoy you break❤
NOOO I was too slow! Everyone’s versions of your Pokémon designs looks awesome though :)  Enjoy your break Mikey, I 100% understand burnout as an artist and I have no idea how you’ve been this consistent on YouTube for this long
Yeah, despite being a fire trainer mostly, I can't disagree, water starters are usually the best because they can learn moves to cover all their weaknesses, all water type Pokemon (unless gimmicky like magicarp for example) can learn ice beam, blizzard, or other ice moves. Which is why I wish they'd find a type combo for starter trios that created this sort of relation ship, it's no longer rock paper scissors, it's more interesting, in fact I've thought of 3 ways you could do it, and even with a fire dragon starter in 1, which people say is a bad idea because it'd be too overpowered.
They call him MR. PIG AAAAAHHHHHHH
"Trainin" looks like a pokemon Mikey should have on his team. His outfit matches this pokemon almost too well. If I didn't know better, if he pulled up his hood, then he could pose and be a "Trainin"!!
NOOO I was too slow! Everyone’s versions of your Pokémon designs looks awesome though :)  Enjoy your break Mikey, I 100% understand burnout as an artist and I have no idea how you’ve been this consistent on YouTube for this long
It's actually because him and pokemen7 are the same person
Take your time, live 💖
You made my lockdown enjoyable, so enjoy your break now and come quickly with some great ideas👍🏻
I just now realized that when he said "At some point in the past I asked you" he was talking about it being named: "ASPITPIAY"
I just now realized that when he said "At some point in the past I asked you" he was talking about it being named: "ASPITPIAY"
The intro is why mikey needs the gamer goggles
The name Leon has been completely ruined for me because of how cocky he is   Also I find my first random shiny in sword and shield before i got my shiny charm
Okay hear me out…Lechonk should get wings in his next evolution for the “when pigs fly” saying. Have a great break Mikey!
Bro did Grunty  Boi just shower, WITH HIS HAT ON
13:45~13:44 By any chance, was there any Cream the Rabbit inspiration there?
Hot damn, Michael has a NICE shower! Also Grunty Boi putting shampoo on his hat made me laugh more than it should have. 😂
I’ve sensed this in several different “poketubers.” Take care of yourselves; self-maintenance is important! The fans existed before your channel, and we can exist while you rest. Taking a sabbath rest is good! Maybe make it part of every week ;)
In reality you are absolutely different from that image of yourselves that you have created in your external consciousness. And your might is unlimited. The potential to be God is laid within you, within each of you. As a matter of fact, you are gods. And your task is to master your divinity little by little, to let the divinity enter your external consciousness.
16:32 CALLED IT
Orcore
I have the same towel
Hot damn, Michael has a NICE shower! Also Grunty Boi putting shampoo on his hat made me laugh more than it should have. 😂
Video idea (ik your taking a break but after) roblox... pokemon.. lomian
I’ve sensed this in several different “poketubers.” Take care of yourselves; self-maintenance is important! The fans existed before your channel, and we can exist while you rest. Taking a sabbath rest is good! Maybe make it part of every week ;)
The shower montage is everything hahahah
Actions speak louder than words, and yours tell an incredible story.
10:36 I paused the video to think and saw almost all of my favorites on the right, but then saw treecko on the left (treecko is my second favorite starter), and right as I unpaused he said “but the left has treecko”
We will be here when u get back
7:37 Haunter is about to pull a Vecna on Castform🤭
Mikey. It doesn't matter take as long as you need for a break. You have a fan base of amazing people that will wait for you to be ready. Just make sure that your break will help you. See ya when you are ready. Also who knows. You may get to 2 million subscribers when you come back (it is unlikely but possible).
Mikey, take as much time as you need I'm sure I speak for most of us when I say thank you for all the entertainment you have provided us over the years. The last thing that I, or anyone I'm sure, would want is for you to get burnt out to the point of leaving for good. Mental health and personal well being are of the up most importance and even though that was not really stated as a reason for the break I feel like it's connected in a way. So please take as long as you need we have plenty of your content to go back and re watch to keep us occupied. Looking forward to seeing you back when you are damn good and ready to be back. Enjoy yourself sir.
Send this to purplecliffe and tell them he's back
Noo[oooooookkoooooo
Take your time, they have been good videos.
grunty boi my beloved
Doomoose looked amazing. If it was ever to become a Pokemon, I'd name it Alaster (since Alastor is actually a deer, not a moose)
Mikey knows what we want in our sponsorships
Play a different game. Could be one that’s similar like Persona
OBVIOUSLY, you need a break, mostly because you have over a thousand videos in the main channel, and who knows how much on the plays channel, and you have been uploading on a relatively steady schedule, for YEARS. The only question now is why he didn't do it sooner
Enjoy your time off because you make all our lives better and you deserve a break.
Stay safe and stay hydrated ! We love ya ! ❤♥️
Glad to hear you're taking time to yourself! Enjoy!
Yeah Lechonk is one of the best pokemon names as they found a way to have a meme while still fitting the Pokemon and the region by combining the Spanish word for piglet and chonk
Mikey: Takes a break.              Dr Squatch: Well who we gonna sponsor now
17:35 Inteleon looks worst tbh
I've been watching you since around 2019/2020, so not too long; but I enjoy your videos, your sense of humor is lovely. I am glad that you are taking a break to recharge your batteries. Keep on making your amazing content
2:08 Indeed- same for Smoliv.  2:48 yep.  3:08 Indeed.  3:12 Cowabummer, lol.  3:37 True.  3:49 What?  4:04 OH NO! WHY? WHY MUST YOU RUIN A CUTE PICTURE?!  4:43 Comic gold. LOL.  7:11 LOL.  7:23 This isn't Yu-Gi-Oh!! Who calls it a "duel"?  8:04 Cyllene is Cyrus' ancestor confirmed?  10:12 OH MY GOODNESS, THIS MAKES TOO MUCH SENSE.  10:21 LOL.  11:08 Why does Cyrus have a point?  11:25 lol.  12:45 OH NO!  13:31 That is EPIC!  14:29 Cool!  15:55 Mad props.  16:30 Hilarious in a "what the heck" kind of way.  17:12 LOL. The king was too Slow to get it.  17:36 Quadruped Incineroar looks epic.
Oh so it’s not because you and your lady friend were expecting which was my guess, either way though you deserve it and we look forward to seeing you return to playing because you WANT to not because you feel you HAVE to
Did anyone seen the dartoad Pokedex in rottom (+_+)
Not again
*sigh* if he would have gone down 2 or four down he would have found mine.
Enjoy the sabbatical I’ll be here when you get back.
We love and support you, and will be here whenever you are ready to come back!
I hope you enjoy your break Mikey, and wish you the best!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Which Gen had the better Box Art Legend reveal? Gen 8 or 9?
I think I can say for all of us taht Mikey can take as long as he wants and to take the best break ever
Maybe make 1 or maybe 2 videos one vid for each channel every other week or two so you would have plenty of breaks with a great up load time
“The Arc Phone proves its not Ar-see-us”  ITS AR-KAY-US AND I CAN PROVE IT  Exhibit A: iPhone’s Voice-To-Text actually spells it right if you say Ar-Kay-Us  Exhibit B: Type Null is based on Arceus, AND HE USES THE R-K-S SUSTEM
You need the break buddy take it you deserve it
Enjoy your break. You deserve it!
7:37 I felt that
hello mandjtv i hope you will fell better about youtube and this stuff  okay cya late p.s. i am going to make a team sky art and maybe post it in r/mandjtv
mikey: single grunty boi in the shower getting all them women with the shampoo on the hat and that is why you should use  Dr.Squatch! (send me the money i am waiting don't thank me for the ad if you don't give me)
gotta say, i think the fact that youve been consistently uploading videos for like 8 and a half years is really impressive. i know that there are gonna be people who say that they need content but honestly, i think that this break is extremely well earned. 8 and a half years of mostly unique ideas is insane. and also being able to set standards and reach those standards every time you upload is impressive. i know you probably wont see this but i just wanted to put my 2 cents in.
Hi Mikey, always love the content and you definitely deserve a break. If I could have a moment of your time. I was just wondering what emulators and randomizors do you use? I have always been looking and there are some many to choose from. I hope you see this. Thanks
Mikey> thank you for the enthusiasm you bring to every video; thank you for being willing to put your extreme passion for the franchise out there for all to see; and thank you for continually showing your loyal fan-base what "if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life" truly means to all of us that enjoy this wonderful hobby as much as you do. I wish you a spirit strengthening and rejuvenating sabbatical. We all look forward to seeing what comes next once your back & mentally recharged!!
Take your time mate! We ll be waiting until youre ready to come back... i cant wait to see your reaction to moxie's take on your recently created fakemon :)
17:28  Top ten cursed images #1 Incinaroar
Do what you need to do homie will be here when you get back
Jacket, use tackle on Mikey!
Love how mikey puts himself over us. Make sure your mental health is okay.
"Trainin" looks like a pokemon Mikey should have on his team. His outfit matches this pokemon almost too well. If I didn't know better, if he pulled up his hood, then he could pose and be a "Trainin"!!
I hope you have a great break, it's important to relax now and then, so have fun!
31 on overall trending
You could make a small change of Orcane to Orcanum. Rest Up. Hope you are back for Violet & Scarlet.
That dartoad art gives me vibes of "Ey girl yo ass is fat, what yo pronouns?"
If not everyone playing pokemon sv doesn't name lechonk Tecnoblade I will just do it my self.
Grunty boi: Ta ta! Me: Tata’s
Best sponsorship sketch so far
This isn’t related but Mikey’s Crystal Ball pokemon reminded me Jynx needs an evolution, their counterparts got one in Gen 4 (Electabuzz and Magmar) but Jynx got nothing I think a Jynx evolution (using a Jynxarizer or change it up with a crystal ball item) would be very cool and finally balance this Pokémon out with their counterparts
He who has an ear, let him  Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless
Really love your vids and enjoy your break but we got your Friends Jack and John to cover for you
That promo tho
You can change orcanesname to cruelca
Take your long-deserved rest Michael!
When the T-Rex is chasing that guy: Does anyone else hear the John Williams welcome to Jurassic Park theme?
Orkain after the first murder?
Grunty Boy shower scene 2.0, Electric Boogaloo
We love you Mike!! Take care of you!!! From Québec ! Home we see you again!!
My mom wakes in on me watching the promo. That was a very awkward experience
I’ve sensed this in several different “poketubers.” Take care of yourselves; self-maintenance is important! The fans existed before your channel, and we can exist while you rest. Taking a sabbath rest is good! Maybe make it part of every week ;)
Enjoy the break, look forward to your return. 👌👍
Have a good break Michael
Those shower montages…. Yea I’m gay
Mikey, take all the time you need. We love you and your content but in the end you need to enjoy it yourself. Never do what you love for other people, do it for you. And if you aren't happy then a break is needed. I hope you have a great break and enjoy yourself. When you feel well enough to come back we will be here for you <3
see you in a month mikey
i swear, terrakidd's dex entry can't not be talking about a fakemon based on a haggis
I'll take that blue pill. It's got my top two, Cyndaquil and Turtwig, but I'd still be to miss out on my third place Popplio.
Take the time you need, Mikey! If you post slower or hardly at all until scarlet/violet, we'll still be here!
11:15 I’m pretty sure that’s not a mod. It was an exclusive pack you could get in animal crossing. (I don’t play so idk)
I think cyrus has a point
13:03 Doomoose reminds me of the Shadow the Hedgehog game logo
why is Fuecoco Among Us?
I will gladly flex my 3 random shinys (stuffel,chewtle,helioptile) and giggle at Mikey's lack of random shiny luck
Ass bitter pie
The Dr. Squatch promos are the best one

Lechonk be stronk
We will miss Mikey while he is away
Hope you get your creative juices flowing again. Take as much time as you see fit, no news will overpower Lechonk's...unless they reveal an evolution for it.
Take as long as you need for your break! 👍👍
Okay so instead of *Orcane,* how bout these:  -Orcadon (Orca, Poseidon) -Orcnautica (Orca, Subnautica) -Mezorca (Mezopelagic, Orca)
:D memes
Michael you don’t need to justify a break, we will still be here
3rd best sponsorship he’s had
You should make a video in the best way to defeat every gym leader. I’m surprised no one has really tried it before, even if it would need to be a 2-parter.
Bye see you later I hope you have a very good vacation:)
Spoink’s spring doesn’t power it’s heart - it’s the other way around!
I miss you already😭😭😭😭😭 I won't be able to look up with our being like. Team sky. Could of been here .
Why is it wherever I watch someone I always see trending
Grunty boi: The Gigachad
Are we going to get a new sexy shower grunty boi montage every time Mikey moves? Or will Mikey finally break into the rocket hideout and use Grunty Bois shower?
He had to give us that sexy shower montage cause we'd be without that gorgeous face for a month to  month and a half.
The best his beard has ever looked
I dont understand what is so good about "Lechonk"...
Take a break my good man, you deserve it.
It's a good desicion to take a break if you're aware that otherwise it could be very bad for you. I hope you can get a good time, get the things done you want in your life and spend times with the persons you want.  Don't let anyone pressure you to make videos. You need your time and should have it, it's very much earned and no one has a right to blame you for that.  I wish you all good <3
Have a good break Mike.
We have platypus Pokémon, they're Psyduck and Golduck (and yes I know they have 'duck' in the name, but they are platypuses regardless, it's in their design), but we haven't gotten any new ones since gen 1, so I'd be all for another platypus Pokémon.
We'll see you soon Mikey! You've earned your break!
Orcane na battora its a mix of battel and orca
Also I just started watching your channel, so I have alot of past content to watch until then.
Everybody needs to take time off to recharge. I quit my very well paying job which I did not like, other than the paycheck, because I felt myself more and more toxic. Now I have a new job, which does not pay as much, but I am happier doing it now. Take as long as you need. We will be catching them all until your return.
Have a nice break  We will be waiting for you when you are ready to return
Hi MY EYE cheal here!
Take care of yourself, your doing the right thing. Sometimes you just need a break from the things you love. I understand, and am waiting for a comeback.
i was taken a bit by suprise at the news you wherent gonna make videos for a while but i understand
2:00 : I think you mean 50%
*sees shower scene*  Me: no wonder this is trending!
No worries man, enjoy your time off and do stuff for yourself. Maybe perhaps, branch off to non pokestuff, just a couple vidoes here and there too see if either people like it and just so you have something that is new and different to keep your excitement up.
I sent this to a freind and they're dad wallked in during the grumty boy shower scene
LEAVE YOUR ENTRYS IN THE SUBREDDIT POKEFANS AND I WILL WATCH SUBMISSIONS IN THE NEXT EPISODE ASPITAPY
Nooooo we will miss you Mikey. I hope you catch up on all the personal stuff you need to with ease. Thank you for all of your hard work and amazing content you have given us. 💙💛🖤 take care!!
WTH
The burnout is fine - we will get more hype videos when he comes back and also I’m pretty sure grunty boi will make some videos for us anyway
Have a nice break Mikey your videos definitely made these past few years a lot more manageable and fun for me especially during the whole pandemic thing.
I 100% support you in this break❤ Come back when your ready, we'll be waiting in full support❤
mikey needs his glasses on before hoodie LMAO
Take your time, I will be here when you return! Love your videos, and will be here to keep watching them when you return!
i wish you the best mikey and take your time please do so
Take care of ur self Mikey we'll be here when u come back
You say Smoliv deserves more love but nobody is talking about Pawmi and I think he's the cutest
Moxie 2d also made art of your pokemon too.
I got a random shiny a few years ago.
3:07
It’s understandable Mikey please take as much time as you need to recover you earned this vacation and we will be waiting for you whenever you feel ready to be back
You really deserve a break tho. I've been noticing that the content had been a bit boring and the reactions are sometimes a little bit fake. Hope you enjoy your break and I am sure that the content will improve.😊
Your health is more important to us than your videos. Please take your time and come back when you feel ready. Your fans will still be here. Enjoy your vacation dude!
You do you boo
I’m sorry your having a burn out Mikey but don’t worry.I know you’ll recover from it, and I will be here to watch your videos always.
Have fun with your break. Hopefully when you’re back you’ll be fully energized and really to roll
sorry mikey for peer presuring you enjoy your break
Again,  warca, walking orca
Self care is important
I cant wait for mikey to come back and make awsome content
Number 23 on trending!
why so long
Enjoy your break, dude. See you when you get back!
We LOVE you whatever you do. Don't worry brotha
that add section should get this video marked NSFW dam!
Its ok we get it
I still haven’t gotten a random wild shiny in SWSH Mikey so don’t feel bad.
1:58 'if it's not 100% accurate then it's 50% accurate' I can already see this
"It's very comfortable..." unless ya hit yourself in the eye.
Enjoy your break <3
11:55 @Moxie2D did this too and they’re SUPER COOL
I can totally understand and even relate to what you're feeling. It's going to be weird not see a video post from you for a while, but I can already imagine the thrill once you post your first video back later on. You deserve this break, and we'll be here cheering you on!  I am from the Philippines and I wait for your videos which comes out usually midnight over here. That's how much of a fan I am. It's inspiring to see you take care of yourself.  Praying for you and your dreams, Mikey!
Enjoy your vacation sir, get off this God forsaken platform
literally have been pronouncing your channel Mand Jay TV for years until right now when i was today years old and saw your hoodie and you said M and J my life is *explodes*
Arright mates, whose gonna rewatch Pokemon Talk for the 13088341092383069th time?
Enjoy your time off
I hope you enjoy your break, you really deserve it. Remember if you decide to come back in a month, a year or even never at all thats totally okay as it's your channel and more importantly, your life. I hope you don't ever feel guilty about letting us down, everyone deserves to do things they're passionate about and whether that is or isn't making pokemon videos anymore is for you to determine. And we'll be here if you come back, ready for this passionate and energised Mikey!
He was voted the Hottest Poketuber for a reason, just saying...
hopefully we will see you in November when we can get the new game
1:57 nah man that's 50% accurate.
2:00 if it’s not 100% accurate it’s 50% accurate
Go take care of you mental health, you fan base will still be here when you get back
my mans was that a square shiny? Cause if so you deserve an award
Gonna miss your videos!!! Please take care of yourself!!!
I don’t comment on YouTube very often, but I do want to let you know, if you are burning out, you are 100% making the right decision to take your sabbatical. Well I’ll still be here when you get back, so take your time and recharge those batteries! Become the amazing and fully charged Baturty we know you are :)
Don’t worry Mikey! You can take as long as you need! Just come back eventually. We can’t have a world with no MandJTV
Speaking as a local fan of the channel: It’s a good thing that you´ll take time for yourself. Don’t let others push you in creating content too quick. Take your time. Your local fans will wait for you.  We would rather wait for a few months or even years for you to recharge instead of losing you for ever.
You don't have to worry about disappointing us. If you need some help do ask us
I'm not even an artist but I completely get it. I get burn out form hobbies. I think everyone would agree that we'd rather you take a few months off and come back for years then not take your break and quit youtube for good. Enjoy your break Mikey.
I’m not gay but that shower montage doe
good lord please do take a good break! always you first, channel, work, or whatever second
It. Happened. Again.
Just take your time we all need a vacation once and a while
You should react to more fusions
I’m glad that you’re taking a sabbatical, and I’m sure that you are too.
See you soon remember you can always stop when you want take long breaks and we still will always be fine
Blue but I will trade snivy and sobble for litten and popleo I like alola
All your vids are awesome Mikey can't stop rewatching and waiting for new vids. You deserve it Mike have a great rest.
"me after hearing Mikey is taking a month off" ok... Time to find another excellent poketuber.. " I never found one"
Take care of yourself and don’t worry!
Take a break as long as you need.
Actually in the anime spoons sits and lays down many times and doesn’t die
Lechonk once again proves that it is Meme Content
Why :(
4:39 I live near a subway that has an all red sign
1:58 no its 50% accurate
I'm glad u r taking a break and I hope u have fun on ur break Mikey, pls take all the time u need, we will be patient! :>
yes
WHAT you're having a break!? THEN I SHALL RESPECT THAT!
Ever since my dad let me try Dr. Squatch I loved it it’s amazing thank you
(Obligatory It's Good To Take A Break Comment) But Can We Talk About The Sexy Shower Montage (Capitalization Protocol Activated) *PLEASE*
You should take all the time you need!! I hope you continue to make videos on this channel but it’s your choice. You should take time and I find things better for you.
All the best, sir
I have a stuffed dog from my young childhood and when I was young I would pretend it could fly with its ears. I guess I’m not the only that had that idea.
Ah sabbatical? How dare you doubt your decision! Jokes aside. Enjoy your time.
y!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Enjoy your break! Take it easy! :)
I miss Mikey already but I hope you made sicc mental health gainz my dude
"Who thought it was going to be charizard?" I mean, I dunno, Charizard alternate form as a legendary would have been super dumb but well....
Take as long as you need off good sir. So you can hopefully comeback stronger then ever.
He put shampoo on his hat 💀
My favorite intro so far
Only 33% accurate. But if it’s not 100% it’s 50% so not that bad that’s a passing mark!
Can you beat Pokémon scarlet using only lechonk?
I praise you for taking care of yourself and your career in the long term by taking a sabbatical. I love your videos and discovered them during quarantine; they helped me stay sane tbh. Take care during your break, Mikey, and know you have the support of your fans. We’ll be here when you get back!
You stated when I was 1 I was born in 2013
Hey mikey can i get a pin mate
Îl be that one dood. Îl play pokemon but the legendary is Chearizard
Most relatable intro I’ve ever seen 😂 (the lethal zipper)
What I love you love you
Mikey deserves this break I've grown up with him. You deserve the rest you're a great youtuber and a good person. Enjoy your sabbatical ❤️❤️
Enjoy your break. <3
Grunty boy wheres a hat proceeds to use shampoo
Man the hoodie got a head shot
Keep good care of your self Mikey. Take the time you need, so we can enjoy your great content and adventures in te future.
I'm glad your taking a break take care of yourself
Jam it man don't scare me like that...
i hope you get well soon! greetings from germany ;)
My personal head cannon is that mytey evolves into trainin
This is 13 on trending btw good job!
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who has faith in him! True faith in Jesus will have you bear good fruit and *drastically* change for the better!  Have a blessed day, everyone! ❤
sorry about the burnout... that's never fun, but I'm glad you know how to solve it. HAVE FUN ON YOUR BREAK AND KNOW WE ALL LOVE YOUR CONTENT! (and u too ofc)
Peace dude we will miss you and wait for your return! You deserve a break✌️
I will miss you Michael I hope your break does you well
I was trying to skip the sponsorship and then when I tried all I heard from skipping 10s ahead was "lack of conditioner and deodorant" help me 😂
Take as much time as you need Mikey
My moms going to think I'm gay if she sees me watching the sponsor
WHAT. Grunty Boi with the THIRST TRAP. One heck of a way for Mikey to start his break.
I have this drawing book with like 70 Pokémon maybe less maybe more once you’re back in hopefully I can figure out how I can send it to your Beemerville it’s not really mean it was most Scarlet andViolet and also XYZ Hopefully I can figure out
I will respect your decision ☕.
I have missed you so much Mikey it is so wonderful to see you again
That intro tho
Hey Mikey take all the time you need have a good break
We'll miss you Mikey take all the time you need.
We all love you Mikey. Take the time you need. We are all here for you.
Happy you’re taking a break you should choose you’re happiness over ours every time.
Enjoy your break  Your videos I do enjoy  Really got me throw the last 2 years  Now your turn to rest  Team sky for life
take care!
Perfect start to the episode
Do what you have to do. And take care of yourself. Love your work
Love the content, been a big fan for a while now. Feel better and we’ll still be here when you get back!
Good luck with your break mikey, hope you can find that passion again.  If I may offer a suggestion, maybe do some other games? Obviously they should be games that you're gonna be interested in and enjoy  and theres a lot of games that are similar to pokemon, like smt. It combines your love of mythology with a very pokemon like gameplay (it's way older than pokemon but you get the point.)   Obviously you dont have too but it would be cool to see you branch out. Obviously, smt is a bit more adult so maybe might not a good idea for a more child Friendly channel.
Can you get a new intro code plsssssss
i will miss you mnjtv
Come back charged up Mikey! Love seeing you happy and fulfilled making videos. Hope all goes well!
i live in england is there a website i could order your merch with £?
When I saw the new Pokémon, I expected Smoliv and Lechonk to both be memed Pokémon cause of their names and I was pretty surprised that only Lechonk got that treatment.
Aaaa sh*t the world is ending
Why is there sponsors every video
Every ytber i watch is taking a month  break 💀 but yea take the time you need mikey (Not my acc)
Hornorb looks like it be from how to train your dragons except it doesn't have wings. Also we all understand what your going through all good👍
sad :(
Do what's best for you man, we will be here when you return
17:03 I just realised the joke here is that France has a history of beheading kings
then why did you make two channels. 😐
Mikey: it's only 30 percent accurate Me: knowing it's 50 percent accurate.
ENJOY YOURSELF MIKEY
Glad I'm not only who ended up thinking/hoping that Lechonk's evolved might be called "Lechungus"
I wanted to post my own art of the Fakemon Mikey made but I couldn’t figure out how to post. I’m a mobile user using the site :,)
That's fine you're got more than enough videos to keep me satisfied ☺️
take as long as a break u want  you deserve it
Best of luck man.
Mikey should react to Moxie2d's video "I Redrew MandJTV's Pokemon for Every Type!" I enjoyed both videos.
Dont worry we understand. Enjoy your break Mikey!
Honestly I noticed and was waiting for this take time enjoy life a bit we'll still be here when you get back
Yeah you deserve a break. Hey after your break can you make pokemon talk again
Take all the time you need. We will be there when you are Back.
Burn my eyes 👀 🔥 I can't see grunty boy the same way
13:41 this reminds me of Dumbo
Take care of you Mickey, take some vacation, keep your head clear and come back to us only when you feel ready to!
I love ur shows
Did anyone else get kicked from the mandjtv discord or just me?
You could call the orca one Berzorca (Berserker + Orca). Just a thought.
gave a like to this vid solely because you're allowing yourself to take some time off.
Sometimes ya just need a break!
You've got to take a break at times. You've touched on it, but you don't just make content for this channel and your plays channel but also John's channel. Incidentally I love the content with John, I think you make a great team, your genuine friendship shines through and you better together. Maybe you should try content with other creators too, plug your let's play channel on there. Anyways, enjoy your break and get your new home sorted too!
Have a good time dear sir
Maybe when you come back to YouTube you could do shiny hunts in legends arkoos
I had to hold my laugh after the new shower montage because I was in front of coworkers. Lol
bye mikey💔💧😭😭😭😭😭😭
Enjoy your sabbatical. Whether you come back or not it has been a pleasure coming home from school and watching your videos
Have fun on your break
hey! you defo deserve this break, I understand sometimes things can be hard, but you are dealing with it ten times better than I would have. If you need an idea for a video, react to moxies new video where he redraws your pokemon, you seemed to have a lot of fun looking at the fanart for your pokemon, and he makes them exponentially good. hope your vacation/holiday is great, looking foreward to you posting again.
Enjoy your break Mikey. You have earned it,
10:48 Me too!!
Please don't take too much of your break planning though. You need rest. And rest you shall give yourself. Have fun Mikey.
have a fun vacation you deserve it
I swear if sprigatito's final evolution  is bipedal it will go from gen nine to gen nein i [Insert pokemon talk litten plush]
Mikey’s on Sabbatical honey
4:52 That meme has already been in the last meme review...
Take care mickey
I wish mickey saw moxie2D video
Love your vids I really hope you dont quit youtube. And I wonder if I can get premition to make a pokemon game with the pokemon you drew and creates
You really deserve a break man, video making must be really hard cause of the ideas and then actually making the video, please don't burn your self out cause a world without your videos is a world I don't want to live in
Are your eyes okay?
#10 on trending? no offense but like....this isn't what you usually see on the trending tab
I remember the origin of every bit of the intro… the good old days
See you in a few mounth then Mikey. Hope you get your spark back soon.
Have a nice break and take your time Mikey ^^
3:23 replays were painful
6:16 best part of the video. Thank me later
youre my fav poketuber
If I ain't getting new Mikey stuff for the next month (and a half probably) then I'll go my way to binge-watch some stuff every chance that I get. The man's deserve some well-needed break if he's being consistent in uploads since 2014. Enjoy the break, Mr. Mikey and I'll be damn excited on your return (hopefully around the time I subscribed to this channel which was September 1st three years ago)
Guys I don't think he knows he's gonna get 2 million subs on this channel soon
My first random shiny was gossifleur
see you soon mickey we will mis you
Can’t wait for your return ❤️ Take care of yourself
Hey man, enjoy your break, we'll wait for you ♥️♥️
I am nearly late but at least I made it on time 6:17 I want to know how everyone felt when they saw this
Hey Michael we love you no need to explain yourself enjoy your sabbatical and we will be waiting here for your return have a good sabbatical
Otossum would have an ability similar to the move secret power and that'd be cool to figure out for each berry
Ahahahahah you took 2 1/2 years to get a random shiny in Swsh. IT TOOK ME 1 DAY(it was a clobbopus)AHAHAHAHAHA
Mikey moxie drew more epic pokemon of your drawing
Ouch eyes
the soap on the hat was funny
You should react to moxie2d i redrew mandjtvs Pokemon
Will miss you Mikey! Enjoy the break and we will all be here once you get back! Love all your videos, been watching since I started college in 2014 and you helped get me through tough times.
We'll be here for you Mikey🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿😁😁
Listening to Mikey's reason for the break, really made me think that he needs script writers and ideas people. I think we as his watchers should recommend ideas on his patreon
Orcane could be changed to Orcanic
can you AT LEAST bring back pokemon talk? it's been 3 years now and you haven't made a new episode since at least 2020.
17:30 i agree you have never been a big chestnut
OH GOD WHY US GRUNTY BOY A THIRST TRAP
I got on Instagram like a week ago. Tried to follow the Instagram account you called out, couldn’t find them (spelled Mammoth correctly, but not how they did) Followed you then followed them.
Enjoy your break you deserve it!
rip mandjtv plays
Even though I'm gonna miss the content for the time you'll be gone. I hope you can get some rest, take some time for your self and the people you love. Take care of your health!
Rename orcane to orcrusher
I'm always ready to like the video, but after the shower montage, I hit the button so hard I almost dropped my phone.
awesome man
I am sad that there not gonna be a vid but you have to do this for you
take as much time as you need to rest mikey!
Love all fakemon
It’s good that you are taking a break to take care of yourself and finish your move. I hope you are doing well physically and emotionally in your life. I hope all of your days are great and have a fantastic life. 😊 <3
You deserve a break Mikey! Your content always makes me happy, and I cant wait till you come back!!
Mikey I did a mytey of every type
love you mikey!!! enjoy your break we will miss you

Mmmm the shower scene
Enjoy your break, it is well deserved :D
Mikey, bro, Miguel, Mikerino, broseph, brojelino, dude, human, person, take care of yourself. You're awesome. See you when you return. Maybe plan to take a month off per year? You could? Maybe. Your life. Life your life. See ya. Catch em all later.
every hello has a goodbye, goodbye my friends. atleast for now,
*”Includes Paid Promotion”* **very faint boss music plays in the back round** *Dialogue Box: “Haha! It is I grunty boy!”*
NOOOOOOOO MANDJTV IS OVER NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
All of us will still be here whenever you feel ready to come back Mikey. We’ll all just go laugh at Jack’s misery for a bit in the meantime. ;)
Take as long as you need your content is great and amazing, I love seeing everything you make but I want you to enjoy making it to so enjoy your break and come back when you feel recharged
mical saw 3 weeks un the future
1:59 but if it's not 100% accurate, then your banner is 50% accurate.

Enjoy your well deserved break!
Take great care of yourself and enjoy your break! You should feel nothing but pride for what you have accomplished and the community that you have created so far. All we want is for you to be happy with your content which means taking the time needed to enjoy creating it. We have plenty of videos to rewatch and pokemon talks to binge so don't worry about us 😊
Enjoy your sabbatical, king.
Congrats on #10 on trending
Just have fun with your vacation.

Bro i still cannot believe that i realized a bit ago is ASPITPIAY means "at some point in the past i asked you"
Sheers to the most handsome Poketuber
Please take as long as you need for a break Miley!!
i know that fuecoco rice cooker animation. and the user definitely don't have the artist's user name. if the the uploader didn't credit the artist somewhere in the post, shame on you xKennidx
Alright mate 👍 get the rest you need don't burn yourself out
Take care buddy ❤️
Better to take a break before your body or creativity force you. I moved in the fall of last year and it took me like 3 months to really feel moved in, and I wasn't working at the time. And I still have projects to make me feel completely settled.
10th on trending
Am I the only one who hates Lechonk? I think it's an overrated pile of junk that deserves to join Charizard in the death pit.
Are you still going to make videoes with John on his channel
mikey can you react to moxie2d redrew of your pokemon
Enjoy your break Mikey and thanks for the fun video......and cursed Grunty boy bathing😨
Sorry I am late to the video, Mikey. May I recommend an idea while you are on break? You mentioned not being sure where to start in terms of figuring out what to do for your business, see I am not a youtuber, I wish I could help you but I have no idea how, BUT there are many out there who could! You could take some time during your break to reach out to other youtubers and ask them "hey, I feel like I need help with everything on the business end, do you have any recommendations for me?" or something along those lines. I am certain there is someone out there who would be happy to help you!
Bulbasaur:Mikey squirtle: grunty boi
Olive Garden exist smolive: and I took that personally
mikeys videos keep me entertained while shiny hunting lol
Dude, everyone experiences some form of burn-out in their lives. Trust me when I say that it is OKAY! Take a break, have fun, enjoy yourself! Arcoos knows that you have earned and deserved it!
I shall say it again. Hardcore Nuzlockes… Suffering for Views.  Jokes aside you have been so consistent (mostly) with your content for so long and I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t waiting for a MandJTV video every week. Well deserved break. Take all the time you need!
As someone who has let themselves get burned out I'm glad you're taking the break early. Personally I haven't been the same since i burned out so please take the time you need.
When you start posting again i would love to see like breath of the wild videos since it is such a big game with almost endless things to do but otherwise i hope you enjoy your break i know it must be hard constintly post new videos
oh man and pokemon talk season 5 just started
Why is Micheal so *FINE*
Out of all the many, many mikeymons my favorite is trainin. I love him because he is just so cute and different from most Pokemon concepts.
Have a good break Michael
10:00 Tell that to the Pokemon TCG lol
You know, I seen many people struggle with needing to take a break, let me tell you to not be afraid to take one because we all need a break and most people would understand so take care of yourself and injoy your break and take more in the future (nothing should pressure you to keep working)  Anyways take care and injoy your time off
hey, can you do a pokemon swsh teams? i have mine: Cinderace, Mr. rime, Grimmsnarl, Corviknight, Tareena and Mudsdale. I replaced Tsareena with eternatus.
you deserve a nice long break man. every time i see one of your vids posted on my home youtube page it is the first thing i click on
Man.  Take as much time as you need, okay?  Burn out is serious.  Don't take a break then spend the whole time plotting.  take a break and TAKE A BREAK.    We'll be here later, I promise.
You can play minecraft like a whole series after you're done with it.
Why am I getting Pokemon Talk break vibes from this lol (take all the time you need you deserve it)
1:25 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Please take some time off! Ignore the brand deals and ignore the consistent upload. You should be excited about your work.  As a sidenote, I love watching your content especially unscripted! You are one of my only connections to pokemon nowadays and just getting your thoughts on everything and anything is fun to me. Hope others agree!
eye review when
Moxie2d did all your pokemon. He did a video on it.
When grunty boy rubbed his underarm i knew it was doctor squatch
Ah yes, the return of Grunty boys shower montage thing.  Also take all the time you need! We understand completely, burnout hinders many people, and it's completely okay to not upload for a month or two, we'll gladly wait patiently until your ready to upload again!
I uhhh found out that aspitpiay sounds like ass spit a pie idk how i found that out
Grunty boi is my senpai
I think  Prof. Oak belongs in the super model section.
Psuedo legendary for scarlet & violet   Spanish Flea Bug Dragon line  1. Fleamite (bug/dragon) evolves at level 35  2. Spanflea (bug/dragon) evolves at level 60  3. Luchaflee (bug/dragon) final evolution.
But Muna is a tapir not a pig and it’s supposed to be based off of the Baku
Imagine, when he comes back, Grunty Boi will be like:"Dude, where have you been?!"
Mickey when my parents walk in :- 6:15
Mikey: *Moves* Squirtle and Grunty Boy: Allow us to introduce ourselves
Also I realized something, after looking at all the pig Pokémon side-by-side all of them have button noses except for La Chonk, it’s nose is what an actual pigs nose would look like in that universe. Also to be fair they could’ve changed the Spoink into a Grumpig and it would’ve still had the same effect
So your banner is 50% accurate?
the shampoo ON the hat was hilarious
Sad..that I don't get to watch your new videos...but it is well-earned vacation. Rest well~
i love watching grunty boi shower
I'm sad will be stopping YouTube for a while but I'm happy that you're taking a mental health break
The Pokémon Professors meme nearly made me spit my Dr Pepper everywhere, that is too accurate for words🤣
Good luck on your break!
Everyone watching mikeys Dr sqatch promos: Who are all these REALLY HOT PEOPLE?
7:50 I might have made a better bit for this  Smeargle used Sketch But it failed… Smeargle became the leader of Germany
Legibly boi
blue has too many pokemon i classifiy as baby
Why does that have the same energy as the time when Jacksepticeye hit himself in the head with his headphones, is it just me?
the banner is 0% accurate, because if its not 100% accurate, it's 0% accurate
Grunty Boi used the shampoo on his "cap" so does that mean it isn't a cap but just his hair that makes it look like a cap?
My first random shiny in SwSh was less than an hour in - a Skwovet on the first route. My luck managed to do a complete 180 once I obtained the shiny charm though. I hatched over 3600 eggs before I got my shiny Mimikyu via Masuda Method, again WITH the shiny charm.
that moth looked alot like mothra and i want it
1:59 if its not 100% accurate its 50% accurate
why not make team sky playthrough legends arkoos
nice and funny
Did you react to technoblade
You deserve a break Mikey, just don't be gone too long, you know how Youtube punishes content creators for doing so, especially if they don't make content on a daily or every other day basis like you. Everyone needs a break from time to time, it's just too bad Youtube doesn't have some sort of program to compensate when people need a break.
Enjoy your break dude, you've earned it.
Do your thing! Take your time to recoup burn out and come back when you're ready and good to go!
17:40 they look better standing up.
Enjoy your break! I hope it helps you relax and get energized again!
Someone PLS make grunty boi shower montage
I understand your pressure. I sincerely thank you for the consistent upload. I hope you have a great break that you need.
Mikey, I just wanna say that I love every video you put out. I've been a fan of yours for a while just as everyone else has been. Take time to refresh and relax. We all will miss you :) but we will be here for when you return!   I understand where you are coming from, I'm in class and everything so I know how things can get busy and stuff can become stale. You do need a break :) take a much needed break and come back when you're ready too :)
We will wait you Mikey, take your time, we love you. You have helped me to practice my english while keeping many people entrained. Thank you Mikey We love you
well have a good vacation!we are all going to miss u for a while!have a good time too!
NOOOOO GRUNTY BIO NOT THE WINK!!!!
are Mikey and Jack still friends because I feel like they haven't mentioned each other or made a video together in months
Thank you, Mikey. Hope you have a great sabbatical, everyone deserves and as someone who met your content in the pandemic I value your time off as the best thing you can do for yourself. Cheers, good luck and see you soon.
I totally understand that you need a break, and congrats on being on trending
Lechonk is near to the name in here philippines of the roasted pig that always food special in feast and anniversary or birthday.. Its called here Lechon. If you google you will see all the image of lechon
Hey Mikey! It looks like everyone else has already said so, but please take as much time as you need and make sure it's relaxing and enjoyable. I'm on a sabbatical from work myself, and I wish I realized how much I needed it sooner than I did. Everyone needs a break once and a while, and I think it's especially important when you're a creative type that NEEDS that passion to be at your best.  Also, can I just say: we the fans would be totally accepting if you just briefly mentioned that you needed some time off at the end of a video: the fact that you devoted so much time to thoroughly explain things really demonstrates your devotion to your fans. We appreciate you so much!
Man you and grunty boi went from “WHY ARE YOU HERE AGAIN AAAAAA” to “hey bro what’s up?”
Why are all my fav people taking a month off like you, Mumbo, Eichiro Oda and Tekking but hes doing 2 weeks
The banner is not 33% accurate  because if it’s not 100% accurate it’s 50% accurate
Enjoy your sabbatical! You deserve. I’m sure most of us will be here when you get back!
I found 2 random shinies, a wooper and a wishiwashi. i actually found them both within 10 minutes trying to catch an op magikarp to beat leon with. Idea was from PokeTips btw
I have loved your vids so much.  Take as much time as you need.
Thank you for taking a break you really needed it you work to hard for us
Never knew how much I needed a slo-mo of Grunty Boi showering until now!
I hope you have a nice break, take as long as you need too! If you're not feeling up to a 100% then you're at 50% so make sure to get lots of rest.
Nooooo I love ur YouTube, listen Mikey, I understand burnouts. But this channel is spectacular. And also…5:21
its name comes from lechon which mean whole roasted pig and well chonky. I know this because I am half filipino
Just me or does the scarlett legendary look like a beyblade
Lechonk, name or not, is 5× better than Wooloo. I hated wooloo
How long do you gonna have wacation
For orcane you could change it to oracruel, a take on orca and oracle while incorporating cruel into it.
Love you Mikey! Enjoy your time off! Thank you for the all the time you’ve spent here
Have fun on your break  Can wait for you to make another video very very soon
Congrats for moving out! I moved out as well recently! It took me quite a while, but except for the kitchen, it should be nearly finished by now! Take your time, but I will miss you! 😃
Yeah, despite being a fire trainer mostly, I can't disagree, water starters are usually the best because they can learn moves to cover all their weaknesses, all water type Pokemon (unless gimmicky like magicarp for example) can learn ice beam, blizzard, or other ice moves. Which is why I wish they'd find a type combo for starter trios that created this sort of relation ship, it's no longer rock paper scissors, it's more interesting, in fact I've thought of 3 ways you could do it, and even with a fire dragon starter in 1, which people say is a bad idea because it'd be too overpowered.
Enjoy ur time off but come back soon we love ur videos
Have a nice vacation
Orcane could be Orcruel, since its a dark type orca
I hope you are able to recharge and I want you to know I totally understand. I love your videos and I hope you can stay on this platform for much longer and not quit, so thank you for catching yourself!
i hope you have a restful break !!
The shower sequel we didn't know we wanted/needed
... I lost it at the Cowabunga meme, it's simple yet... super effective on Blaze... Then Mikey used quick attack, wait WHY AM I IN A DOUBLE BATTLE?!
I envy your luck Mikey. I have been playing pokemon since ORAS and have yet to encouter a wild shiny. Also I hope you have a fantastic break!
We will miss you while you’re gone, but you have to take care of yourself! Looking forward to seeing you again when you’re ready to come back!
At this point, Grunty Boi should just move in with Mikey and become his roommate.
Yeah I agree, I hate pigs, I think they're weird looking, ugly, gross animals... but the name changed my entire opinion of Lechonk, like instead of Thanos snapping his finger to get rid of 1/2 of all life, he instead made 1/2 of all life happy, a snap of a finger response, instant fame for LECHONK! I wouldn't even dare nickname it, and I love nicknaming Pokemon, the only Pokemon I don't try to find a name for is legendaries, they're already bad ass, why would I demean them by giving them a name.
Once grungy boi reminded me of the shower scene, I came to a realization: MandJTV is no longer just a Pokémon YouTube channel. It is a phenomenon, an experience
Have a nice vacay
I will be bummed that you won't be posting for a month, but I understand that you need a break from YouTube because I don't want you stopping YouTube for good
Take as much time as you need, bro. I’ll be here when you get back. Love your content
love you and your content mikey, take all the time you need you deserve it! <3 thank you for making all of this amazing content for us
Anybody else getting some serious Pokémon talk vibes
Hope it's a good sabbatical!
6:18 ; now I know why this video is trending lmaoooo
The way you said “Cowabunga it is” made you sound like you were a ninja turtle
Am I the only one who is getting Charlie Cox vibes from bearded Mikey
I love how he is so transparent, take a rest king
I'm a fan of you but that intro was staged. It did not hit your eye I watched lol. Possibly your right eye but not your left
Mikey don’t quit YouTube But if you need a break it’s for the best
Think about the children
Lmao cowabummer duuudee😂🤣
I’m glad your taking a break you definitely deserve it
NOOO! WHY!? GROWLITHE USED ROAR! And it was an 1:8192 Shiny Growlithe in Pokemon Silver! 3:04 killed me! Because it was my only 1:8192 I ever had! 😭🥺😖
4:47 you have a good grunty boi impression
6:18 not as good as the first one
I have a question, will you still be appearing on pm7's channel during the break or are you not going to appear on any channel?
So who filmed grunty boi showering?
Ok. Since this is a Lechonk Meme video, I need to ask this! Who would win! Bidoof or Lechonk?!  I'm tempting to Bidoof, but Lechonk gave him the fight of his life! More than any other Pokemon could ever do! But this is why Bidoof is THE GOD POKEMON and Lechonk is the God Pokemon #2! 😁
Take your time Mikey. We all would rather miss your vids for a small amount of time, then have you burn out fully and we lose you entirely. We will be here when you get back buddy. Take care of yourself man.
Good for you man, you have amazing content and we all want to see you continue down this road. Rest up and hope to see you back in the future!
I feel like mikey and me can agree that grunty Boi is quite the sexy sponcerer
Mikey drip is to op
Have a good break.
What a bitter sweet way to go. Well, go play "real life" for awhile Mikey. We'll be here when you get back!
Orclaw
OH GOD PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOUR EYES
Its great you are taking this break on the channel now, if you carried on, it could become a snowball. Enjoy your sebbatical
Mikey, I am 35 now and have been watching you for years and I'm so happy you are taking time for yourself, you are one of the funniest, most entertaining you tubers I've seen and wish you the best and enjoy your time off!! Looking forward to qhen you're refreshed and back and better than ever 😊 just remember, don't let the floor tentacles get you 😜  Much love  Greggles
I support the sabbatical! Hope you get some rest :)
I drew the Fakémon but the Reddit bots kept removing them for spam I'd love Mikey to see them so I'll definitely try to post them again later, but they were super fun to draw! As for the break, I only recently discovered your channel but that just means there's more old videos for me to watch. You take the time you need to start feeling better.
The fact just today I got my first ever bar of Dr. Squatch and I see a sponsor on a video
I think Lechonk is a a food called Lechon, The word lechón originated from the Spanish term lechón; that refers to a suckling pig that is roasted. Lechón is a popular food in the Philippines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Canada, the Dominican Republic, other Spanish-speaking nations in Latin America, and Spain. The dish features a whole roasted pig cooked over charcoal
We will miss u till u return
Take all the time you need to rest! Burnout is not a joke, and taking time to prevent that is important!  We will all be here when you get back, So don't sweat the time to yourself. We can wait.
Mikey: *realizes that the socials are only now 33% accurate* Me, a fan of him: Did you mean 50% accurate?
If anyone comes at you for putting your mental health first, they don’t deserve you.  Have a good break, Mikey, your content will wait until you’re ready for it.
Enjoy your break Mikey! but damn i will miss you right away because a day without mjtv is boring. Take your time and we will look forward seeing you with your new videos.
Will you continue to be a part of PM7s content?
For thee liiiiigghhhttttt
Love this channel and how interesting it has been. Go take time but please come back.
@mandjtv Do you know who Technoblade is if so R.I.P Technoblade.
Congratulations on going trending. Currently 14 from when I’m watching it. Plus over 216k views already. 12 hours after the video was posted.
bro this video is #14 on trending fro some reason
Damm those quadruped Pokémon are ugly as heck Especially inteleon you know what good job gamefreak sorry i now see where you are coming from Oh btw it’s at 17:31
33% accurate that means its 50% accurate!!!!!
Love you and your content Mikey. I hope you take all the time you need on sabbatical and come out of it rejuvenated.   As a sport and performance psychologist I’m really grateful to creators like yourself and Jack who are open about their struggles with burnout, it affects almost everyone differently and your normalizing helps everyone. I hope through this time you’re surrounding yourself with friends, loved ones, and maybe even a counselor/therapist to help you manage and sustain for the long term.   Can’t wait for you and grunty boy to return when the time is right. 💙💛
Yes the bathroom
take a nice vacation Mikey
Pokémon adverts I've seen pronounce it arkeus. The most likely name origin is from the Greek "Arkhe", so I'm going with that. It's probably arkeus It could be arkoos (especially if the latter half of the name is derived from "zeus" rather than "deus") Archeus and archoos are also possible (mediaeval pronunciations of arkhe had a ch sound rather than a k). Arseus is definitely wrong.
Justice for Smoliv
Have an awesome break! Praying it’s refreshing and fruitful for you! Your “What am I working on Monday to release for Saturday” really resonated with me as a preacher 😂  P.S. I hope the “_______ type Then VS Now” series will continue! Some of my favorite videos! But I totally get those things probably take foreVER to script.
I was wondering when this would happen. You've been so consistent for so long I was thinking it had to be  taxing on you. Take your time. We will be here. With scarlet and violeton the way, hopefully there will be a fresh new vigor for pokemon content on the horizon. Enjoy your break. See you soon!
Dear God, grunty boy got shampoo on his hat
Take your time, dude. Health, both mentally and physically, is the most important thing you can have. Spend time with your girl and get back on track.
Good luck Mikey we understand what your going though and we hope you come back because we all love you and your channels.
I don't understand why everyone loves Lechonk so much. It looks like a normal pig to me lol
I'm sick of people bashing Inteleon because you know what? Inteleon is super cool, super badass (way more than you'll ever be) and awesome in battle. Inteleon will kick Cinderace's ass any day. I Masuda Method for a Shiny Inteleon and I love him. I don't care what anybody says. I love my Shiny Inteleon and I'll always appreciate him and how cool he is.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all! ♥️
Man, first KickAssReaction, then Lost Pause, and now Mikey. Burn out's really getting to some of my favorite creators. Well, take your time, bro. Hope you enjoy your break and I'll be looking forward to your return.
I fully understand your mindset. Hope the break helps
You neeeed it
We will be here when you get back Mikey <3 take care
I found my first random shiny metagross a few days before your video and it was hailing "hail no" and it died before I could get it I was so devastated that I haven't played sword or shield since.
why
Finally, a meme review!
It’s all good Mikey. We’ll miss you❤️. Hope that you will feel better during your break. Take all the time you need. We’re not mad but we will miss you. We understand because moving is a big thing and you really do need one. We’ll miss ya bud
Mikey, take all the time you need. I understand creative burnout and needing a break. I hope that you come out the other side feeling energized and excited to create, because I- no, I think we all want you to put your happiness before your channels. Enjoy your break.
Dude I've been wondering for months how you haven't gotten burned out yet.   Glad you're listening to your body and find what you need to do.   Have a good sabbatical! We'll be here for you when you get back. ☺️
I look forward to seeing you again. I love your channels and have loved them for years now. You guided me back to this childhood love of Pokémon and I wish you nothing but the Best John Michael Wingul.
I love the fact that grunty boy conditions his hat not hair
10:49 Isn't psyduck a platypus?
Orcane should be named orgore
All good Youtubers must hit themselves in the eye during an intro at least once. That’s like, one of the rules of the universe.
LECHONK!
Take the break you deserve it. Also you said you were having trouble with ideas so I have a suggestion. How about doing more pokemon then versus now, there are still a bunch of types you didn't cover.
Glad you're taking time for yourself. It's so easy to get caught up in keeping going, but you have be sure that you're taking care of yourself for the long run. We'll miss you and will be here when you return.
Take your time mate!
too much of a good thing isnt a good thing. take you a break man, we will all still be here when ya get back. you for sure deserve time off and time for yourself.
Nooooooooooooo DID NOT GOOOOOOOOOOOOO POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO U LATER THIS NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO PLAY POKEMON
I completely understand! Everyone needs a break!
1:59 actually…
14:52 orbane is right there!
Sad to hear we won’t have videos from you for a while, but you have to do what you need to do.  Will we still maybe see you in collab videos on PM7. Understandable if not, but that would at least mean we’d get a little Mikey joy while you’re on sabbatical ^^;
We love you and your videos💛💛 and I agree a little sabbatical is very much required.... I would say setup your house to make it your own and visit me here in India and I'll make sure you have a great visit 😁 ( one mechanical engineer poke fan to another 🤪)
Me and my brother made a ton of Fakèmon of our own and it turns out an extremely similar name has been designated to one of Mikey’s creations. I guess you could say he has good taste. XD
Take all the time you need. I know how hard it can be to work so hard, enjoy this time to relax
Bro falscourge be lookin like the sun temple from bloons
I swear whenever Mikey... ahem.. Grunty Boi- and Mikey- get the opportunity to, they seem to be naked... sure it's doing fan service- but eh Also no problem Mikey, take as much of a break as you need
I feel like lechonk and wooloo are different sides of the same coin
take all the time you need. Though if pokemon is causing you exhaustion, maybe try and play other games that would games that would help you enjoy gaming more. Like you said can't play the same game over and over without getting worn out and bored.
Also I am totally not wearing team sky in bed
Sadly cancer has taken another legend
ok
Take your rest and follow your heart! Hope you to see you again when you’re ready
Grungy boy knows what the people want 👀  Edit: I only speak for myself but I am truly glad you are taking some time for yourself. Everyone deserves a break and time to rest! I’ll be looking forward to when you come back but I hope you take all the time you need for yourself!
Yet another reaffirmation of your status as the most attractive poketuber.  But yeah. You have your break Mikey. You deserve it.
Wow it was quite interesting; Please enjoy your time away, can I suggest Orcane’s name be changed to Orcakril?- like over kill, and Orca/krill?-
Enjoy your break!! I hope you come back feeling refreshed!!!!
Mikey's most painful intro
Dr squash trading soap game bring it back plz
I would like to find the person who said Smoliv was ugly, just to talk
If I ever had my light on at night and a cosmoth hit my window I would cry
Do what you need to do Mikey. We will all be here when you get back. Take care of yourself
Take the time you need mikey and see you when you get back :)
You deserve a break. Everyone deserves a break from time to time.  Side note: I don't know if you'll see this, or even want to take suggestions for ideas to do for the channel(s), but you could shift to playing some Nintendo games while keeping Pokemon as your main focus. This could be something more for your Plays channel though. You could also commission artists to make Fakemon art based ideas that you give them and do reaction videos for those.
Uhhh grunty boi umm what was that?! Also I completely understand the time off and I hope you have a good rest thanks a lot :)
Rest in peace Technoblade
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I would have checked out Moxie2D’s recreation; of you fanmons
I love your content and I am happy that you realized that you were getting to this point because yes I am sad that you will stop for a while but I would much rather this then forever I am fine with this and I wish you well in this part of your journey
Wingulls thst currntly sit outside my home: "annoying wingull sounds" Me: will ya sod of ma'e its 4 aclock at night and the sun is up already, im tryin to sleep you lot
I've been here for a while, and I'm still waiting for him to spit a pie.
enjoy your breaks Mikey
I like the video, but I think you should promote the artists. There's plenty of great ones on reddit as well. When you're back from your break, maybe that'd be a cool video to bring your community together? I hope you have a good break!
All i know was i wasnt paying attention for 2 seconds and it went from Lechonk to Sexi shower Grunty boy.   Ok. Lol
i like how all your interactions with Grunty boy are now so chill!
Don’t worry take as many breaks as you want :>  Honestly I have a lot of empathy for u cause imagining your situation would be super hard :]
Thank you for the video.
Not again Grunty Boi 😂😂😂
Mikey, if you need to hire a researcher, I’m available.
Mighty may be the mascot, but Grunty Boi is the box art legendary
Listen as a Filipino person, I feel _obligated_ to love Lechonk. And I don’t even eat lechon. Either way, I’m definitely putting Lechonk on my team when I get Scarlet/Violet!
u can't stop me from watching all ur vids before u come back
I just now realized that when he said "At some point in the past I asked you" he was talking about it being named: "ASPITPIAY"
Pokémon eye poke review

Hear me out: If the information in the banner is 33% accurate, and therefore not a 100% accurate, doesn't that make it 50% accurate???
I stayed awake for a week without sleeping
Take all the time ya need, Mikey! We'll be here waitin' for ya, promise ya that much! Please take care of yourself, and I look forward to your gallant return!
Dude the hat🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Normalize youtubers taking more breaks and making sure their mental health is in check and they don't get burnt out!  Have fun on your break, Mikey. We'll be here when you get back <3
the wink 6:28
Lachonk needs to evolve into like chonkyboi
Yeah, thats totally reasonable, dont worry mickey, your health is the most important, take your time and be better,   (Sorry if theres a spelling error,  english is not my foreign language and its been a while since im writing anything in english)
Do it, Michael! Take care of yourself, the people that love your content will more than understand your need for the lovely(at least I hope) sabbatical!
actually it’s 50% percent accurate
I've been a huge fan of yours for the last 5 years. You deserve a break just like anyone man. I've tried some gameplay challenges that you and PM7 have done and you guys have made me love Pokemon more than ever. You're my favorite PokeTuber and look forward to every video you ever make. Have a great vacation man!
Lechonk is a lechon 👁👄👁
I hope you feel better soon and find a way to make yourself happy with your work, please do not feel pressured to rush yourself back, we are all here to support you and will be patiently waiting to support you upon your return. You are a talented person that makes great content and you deserve to be happy. Good luck and I hope you enjoy your sabbatical.   For what it's worth, I actually skipped the memes at first to see the important update. Your mental health is more important than Pokemon Memes.
The intro is why mikey needs the gamer googles
play smash ultimate or pixelmon XD it's pokemon related 😊
May you have a most pleasant  sabbatical
cosmo should evolve by using the move “fly” 100 times and gain a fire typing
I'll miss your content Mikey. Enjoy your break. Can't wait to see your new content
Enjoy your sabbatical Mikey!
I can never skip grunty boy he is the best ad ever
Grunty boi was wearing a hat and using shampoo in da MIKEY'S shower
Oh DAMN UR TRENDING ILY
Orcane kinda looks like the evolution of Orkit in Pokefarm Q
Well, see you then!
Just noticed mighty in the background
Can I use some of your pokemon in my fan games? Their called light and dark
When you turn a hobby into work, it does get tiring at some point. Definitely need a breather
Imma go watch that video of every type Pokémon, and draw them as realistic DnD monsters. Good luck on your break dude!
The shampooing the hat had me rolling! Top tier humor
Honestly none of the memes were too funny but the lechungus got me dying 😂
Hey you should make gruntiey boi Merch
I understand that you need a break. I can watch your older/more recent videos to pass the time while you take your break. While it does make me a little sad that you won't be uploading for a while, your physical/mental health is far more important then your channel. Like I said, I understand that you need a break. I'm perfectly okay with you taking a break. Hopefully WHEN you come back, you will feel refreshed both physically and mentally. I wish you the best. From your loyal subscriber Blake Wyatt dunfee. Ps. Hot take, I hate jojo.
Take care mikey!
Mikey, take all the time you need to recharge. Your videos are great, but you need time for you as well. I, for one, look forward to seeing your content again when you are ready.
I have an idea to help you with creativity: play a new game. I would recommend Undertale and Deltarune, as they are my favorite video games and I think you will really enjoy them. Thank you for making videos, they are very funny and I have a good time whenever I watch them.
I was thinking about buying the hoodie until at the beginning of this video I swear I thought it was a minions hoodie. So now I'm scared of it.
Yeah!!!! Break time!!!!!
I personally think that quadruped Chesnaught looks awful. The only one that looks good is Emboar
Mikey really needs a vacation/a break from YouTube, he always posts for us every week we wish to see you again next month love your vids❤❤
This hit the legit trending list
Take all the time that you need Mikey. We will all wait for you 💙
I enjoy all your videos enjoy your time off you deserve it
Is grunts boy gay?
Waaaaaaa
Have a good break Mikey, hope you figure things out! You deserve this break. See you soon 😁
Good news Mikey, because it isn't 100% accurate, your account info is at least 50% accurate, not 33%.
My only 2 random Shinies that were full odds were Absol (my first shiny ever) and a archen that was my fist ever encounter of archen in my life
I’m so sad I started crying cause your my favourite YouTuber so I really won’t have anything to watch except purplecliffe and pm7
Are you still planning on doing next month's *clap* *clap* meme, review! even if you aren't ready for other videos yet? I'm only asking because I'm worried about the sorting by top in the last month method causing anyone who posts at the beginning of your absence to not be able to be seen, and I would feel bad. If you end up skipping it for your own health, that's also fine, I'm just wondering
The professors in Scarlet and Violet have convinced me just how bi I am
Mike looking like he needs to find the avatar to restore his honor.
“Not a threat, unless your stupid”
You know, I had kinda noticed it. Reminded me of an old channel I did things on. Difference is, I DID hit burnout. So good on you for taking the time to figure out how to take care of both yourself and your business. I'll be here. Honestly wish I could find a way to offer any skills i have, but alas, you don't know me. Take as long as you need man.
Do you know how many videos you have on here? That break is so well earned, anyone else would agree. In fact, I have never watched any of the Pokemon Talk vids and I could use some catching up. Seriously-enjoy your break. The fans will be here whenever you return.
Eagerly awaiting your return. Have a good break, man.
the promotion is a sin
Also when u come back, keep making more Pokémon types then vs now I like that series
You still going to do challenges on John and Jakes channel
Fair, enjoy ur sabbatical come back fresh with some more awesome content!!!
Norman's on sabbatical
Why noooooo
We still love you Mikey! I really look forward to you finding your goals and revitalizing your motivation on your channels! Remember that, no matter what, you will always be unique, special, and loved! Thank you for all the great content for these past many years, and take as much time as you need/want!
Those Pokemon that were showcased should actually be in the game, and I can literally picture them in the anime too.
26:09cute!
Get well Mikey! Take your time, get your mind right, we love you and your content, I'm sure everybody is aware how serious this situation is. I know what you feel, kinda. I was working for last 2.5 years almost everyday at my job, I took exactly 19 days off because I needed to provide to my family because of pandemic. And 2 weeks ago I finally took a break and I feel like a whole new person, the only thing that's different is I kind of hate my job so I'm sure you're going to come back when the time is right and find a motivation to do some more content. We love you Mikey? Take care?
It's ok Micheal but after 1 month or half of it can you play roblox please
Take Care Mr. Michael Sir!!  You really deserve some time away indeed and I'm glad you're doing what needs to be done. Enjoy your Well Deserved Time Away 😀
Please don't pull a poketips and disappear forever!!!!
If you need a break then take one, totally understand that you need to recharge your battery from time to time, you definitely earned it.
Take a break dude     Lechonk reminds me of techoblade o7
I have a name idea for an evo for falscourge, titome  Edit: another name could be titomb
Once in my life I think the shower is hotter than Grunty Boi
Grungy boy has no shame. Or disgrace.
noooooooooooooooo 🥲
I’ll miss your stuff, but understand you need a break to do good creative work. Really amazing you haven’t taken a break until now but it’s also healthy to have a work - life balance. It’s a good time to take a break as Scarlet and Violet are a ways off and Arceus is older news now. Sorry Arkoos.
Take the time you need to recharge, Mikey!! You have been working hard and we all need breaks some times!!
That’s what she said…
Take all the time you need, Mikey. No pressure from the Pokéfans. What makes your content great is that you put your heart into it, let your creative genius shine through, and creativity isn't something you can just turn on and off like a faucet. I'd rather wait for the good content than get subpar content immediately. We'll be here when you get back, and hey- if we need our MandJTV fix in the meantime, we can always go back and peruse some of the classics. I myself might take the opportunity to binge-watch Pokémon Talk again.
Gg my man, love the content, will be here when you come back. Love the Pokémon meme review always look forward to it at the start of the month. Take your time you deserve it.
Enjoy your vacation buddy. We’ll be here when you get back.
It's fine bro. Take your time at the move and enjoy your rest. A healthy youtuber is a happy one, as they don't say, and if you're happy, so am I.  We'll be here for ya once you're back.
Do what ya need bro. Rest the creative juices
Mikey if you need to take a break you need to. Don’t over so it. Big fan of your videos btw. I hope you get better soon.
I’m a orcrane main in rivals of either
How long before Mikey hitting himself in the eye appears somewhere in the memes
It’s okay my guy! Everybody deserves a break! You have a good time while you aren’t needing to stress about YouTube and stuff. You earned it man :)
I have a guess for the Lechonk evolution line names:Lechonk, Lechubb, Lethik
how this trewnding lol'
Did you know that there exists an Orca-Wolf in Loomian Legacy named Akhalos
Take as long of a break as you need. Will make the team sky vids all the more special whenever you get back to them.
WHY DIDNT YOU NAME IT THE M AND TSHIRT
Aww I made hawkatrice canary but it was not in the vid
Sorry what was the point of sponsoring again I just saw pretty bathroom
You’ve really helped me escape in the times where I have been dealing heavily with burnout this past semester of school. Do what you need to do to make what you love enjoyable again. A lot of us are struggling to do the same thing but wouldn’t wish for anyone else to experience it. Thank you and take your time
Wait, grunty boi showers with a hat on?!
early
A word of advice for planning.  Get in the shower and think hard. It always works for me!
Hot damn, Michael has a NICE shower! Also Grunty Boi putting shampoo on his hat made me laugh more than it should have. 😂
Of course hearing there will be no Mikey videos for a while makes me sad, but whatever you need to feel at ease and enjoy your life more ♥ All the best energies for you!!
Have fun on your break Mikey, you definitely deserve it and we’ll all be here when you get back 😁
I feel like a group channel with mikey, john, and jack would be fun
Enjoy you break!
Did anyone else notice that saxolotle is in the background of the comic with Karen, Mikey, and grunty boy on the last frame
10:59, can someone explain that meme to me
I totally understand Mikey I could tell you were struggling to make content bc you make so much and on a schedule and have a personal life. You should totally recharge regroup and reevaluate. Hey! You should ask Grunty Boi to cover the channel during your sabbatical. I'm sure things will go well
Take your time, hope you can regain your drive and inspiration
Everyone needs a break every now and then, fully understandable.  When you come back, I suggest posting a video asking for ideas and the one you like most is your return to YouTube.
at the beginning it was so funny
oh my this #12 on trending. Congrats
Take your time man. And good luck. We will still be here when you get back.
It's ok Mikey we can wait!
I don’t normally comment but I just wanted to say you’re definitely one of my favorite Pokétubers and I will miss your videos. That being said you are awesome and deserve a mental break or whatever the break is for man. I can’t wait to see you back and enjoy your content again! Take whatever time you need and we will all be here waiting for you. Much love bro
Mikey need a vaca so its fair like He has posted WEEKLY for 8 YEARS on 2 Channels So Mikey have a nice break :)
Don't worry Mikey, take all the time you need. You deserve it
My parents walked in on the shower montage ;-;
why not play mystery dungeon?
Mikey, R you sure your not having a break so that you could pursue other careers like a Dr Squatch model?
Moxie2D made a video of your creations.
You've uploaded 100s of videos yearly. You've been owed a break for ages
WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET REGIONAL SKINS FOR GRUNTYBOY!
Have a relaxing break my dude
Damn where is hoodie hit him was unown
Leopowd looks like a Neopet
I respect your choice micheal but why during the summer :(
You deserve the break mikey, you content is still amazing
Take your time Mikey. We'll miss you but your mental health comes first. You deserve a break.
take a long break, king
When you do come back, the game rivals of aether that Orcane comes from has an interesting interaction with steam Workshop, where you can create any character with any moves, it would be interesting if you tried some of the pokemon they created!
We all support you Mikey. We want you to take a break because then the videos will be ones you’re happy with making, and so they will be better. Do what you need and we hope to see you whenever your ready to come back.
Go ahead mikey! Take your well deserved break!
19:15 thats a nice drawi- notices what type of pokemon it is
Hope you will find the answers you are looking for and have a good rest Mikey! It's important to enjoy creating content and if a large rest is needed we will wait patiently! Take care and wish you the best ;)
Enjoy your break hon🥰
I wasn’t expecting the shower scene
“Take your time mental health is important” -wii fit trainer probably
Have fun on your break, take your time, quality is always worth waiting.
when you come back can you do the vieo that mioxe2d did plz         thank you!
We understand Mikey take a hiatus and enjoy a break and recharge. We love your content but we want your mental health to be ok as well.
Good on you for realizing your own limits, Mikey. Not many people can accept they HAVE limits and keep going until they crash and burn.  Enjoy your sabbatical, my friend 😄
Been watching for years appreciate the entertainment it’s been blast on our end thank you for the memories and get your emotions back up
for the Orcane rename why not like "Orbane" it's similar, while giving a name for it's Dark typing
Your not stupid you have a digree
Take a good break Mikey, hope you enjoy it.
its fine take all the time you need
Take your time. Pokémon is wonderful and I love the content you make, but the creator is more infinitely important than the content. Take it easy, play some other games for a palate cleanse, and figure yourself out to your satisfaction. We’ll be here when you get back in order.
Take care of yourself :) Hope you enjoy your break!
Have a pleasant time off. Enjoy yourself, relax, clear your mind, and come back with fresh ideas, new drive, and renewed passion.
Well I guess Terrakidd was prepared
Respect take as long time as you need
Will you still make videos with John?
Rest is good, Michael. Go take a rest and reenergize. You need it, and we will look forward to revitalized videos in the future! This is a job for you, but it should be fun, too. Enjoy your sabbatical!
Enjoy your break! It is well deserved!
Well I done seen about everything. When I see dog fly
My very first encounter in the wild area on my first playthrough of swsh was a shiny Tyrogue, will never forget my excitement! Evolved it into a shiny hitmontop, one of my absolute favourite shinies!
Is it just me or does almost ever Dr squatch sponsored video have a shower scene?
You do you sir. We will all eagerly await your return.
Mikey!! U finally look like a MAN! I remember when I was 23
Enjoyyour sabbatical Mikey! :D We'll be here when you come back!
We love you Mikey, take your time and rest. We care about you and your health (physical and mental) especially with gen 9 coming up, burn out is real. Rest and recover, we love you and will gladly wait for you :)
My first ever shiny was in Sun, and it was a freaking MALE Salandit. I then lost it when my Bank glitches out.
Can we get a grunty boi only fans whilst you’re away?
We have all sinned and fallen short of Gods glory sin is terrible because of sin we are separated from God but gladly here is the good news Jesus Christ came and walked this earth for everyone taught us the perfect way to live and how we should live and he died for our sins because we need a sacrifice to pay the price for our sins since our sins deserve hell if we live in sin but also more good news Jesus rose from the dead three days later we have to leave the sin behind and put it away and live new with Jesus this world is like a vapor it passes away but your eternity is forever and it is up to you what you want to do with it Jesus Christ is coming soon……
Have a good break
Technoblade is dead
Take a break. Creators are humans too, that includes you. Will we miss you while youre taking a break? Yes of course. But we shall be patient. Take your time. Youre health, mental and physical, comes before content.
Mikey is taking a vacation theory debunked. Hes not burnt out. Its because he’s Pregnant!    I of course am joking. Take as much time as you need. I look forward to the next upload. Take care of yourself my man.
Enjoy your sabbatical! I really enjoyed the art video especially seeing Moxie’s take on them. I think seeing more fakemons would be great.  That being said maybe consider doing other videos on creature capture type games. Nexomon is fun. Monster Sanctuary is a blast. I think branching out into these new things once in a while would be healthy for you but also exciting for the viewers.
That shower montage though!! 🥵   All fun and games, it was funny though
Godly gamer with no goggles
Everyone gets burned out, I have the same in school and that never happens to me but after a 3 day weekend I was back in the saddle so I understand with all statements of being burned out and great video
Man dosent know wat hapend to technoblade
And  when there’s a new Pokémon direct please react to it and wait for when you come back
2:26 Lethicc would be a much better name though… for an evolution of course I’m not crazy!
Grunty Boi just putting the shampoo pn his and hat winking at is me is hilarious 😭
Take care of yourself mate :) <3
Enjoy your time off Michael. You've made so many great videos throughout the years. You deserve a break. I'm going to be looking back of some of my favorites of your videos while you're gone. Looking forward to seeing what you do next.
Well I got a shine treeko in sword on my SECOND masonic method egg, and I wasn't even trying to get a shine
Maybe by the time you come back you csn make more pokemon talk
The beginning of this scared me but you deserve this and just know we have a lot of respect and love for you and grunts boy so go take these months off and please don’t quit soon and you are my favorite poketuber and YouTuber and the reason I play and like Pokémon so all of us will miss you and want you to not quit before gen ten
Orcane's name should be Orking
I’m Sorry Mikey but I’m Stupider than you so I won’t be buying a hoodie I don’t want to die
Good luck with the break, I hope you make time to enjoy yourself
See you on the other side, Mikey. You deserve a break. I never knew how hard you worked until this video.
Rest well, our hero.
i liked only because the intro jk love your content keep up the meme reviews =)
Don't worry Mikey, have all the rest you need, I just hope you're doing ok
We understand Mikey. Everyone feels that way at times. Take a much deserved break, and give yourself a chance to relax.
I had the exact same thought of a Platypus Pokémon that was Water/Steel.
I know the second I scroll down theres gonna be tons of sympathetic comments and im not about being sympathetic so theres one thing I'll say has a guy that has experienced burnout because of school work while trying to keep up with friends all I will say is take advantage your break and just do you
RIP Mikey’s eye 😭
Aww..take a break. You deserve it. Your videos always make me laugh, especially those with Jack and John. Have a good rest :)
Get yourself a man that looks at you like grunty boy looks at his soap
No matter what, theres Pkmn Scar and Vio on the horizon. If you’re gone/recharging til they come out, it would still work. As maybe a Fresh pokemon vanilla experience is something you need to re-start those Creator juices.
good luck in your hiatus!
10:35 blue
JOKES(NOT FUNNY TO EVERYONE) Mikey: not a safety hazard  Me: who fell down trying to press the video  Mikey: not gonna upload for a while  Me: … do I have to watch purplecliffe now  Grunty boo: pulls out dr squatch from a plant Me does the exact same thing  Me: why’s my hand swelling?
Congrats on the trending
enjoy your time off❤
I personally don’t have goals as of right now (I’m technically dead 💀), but you do your best and remember to take it easy
I still have the towel that grunty boy uses had it since I was like 8 almost 20 years now
Hi Mikey I hope you take a good break you earned it and I was going to ask you to tell me happy birthday because tomorrow is my birthday I am asking you because you are my favorite YouTuber. Especially since we also have the same name take care❤️.
Take all the time you need to get back fully charged! Hope to see you as a cameo in a video of PM7 or Purplecliff or someone else, so we don't have to miss you entirely.
Me when looking for shinys: no luck Shiny's when i'm doing something random: bonjour.
Sorry ladies, the team rocket hat stays on
Shiny coal and whales. Initially, titans illustrate moreover the tasty zero. Whenever pillows sleep, quantum dishes. On the other hand, crispy ghosts the doubtful hydrofoil cytochemicals potentially cup in randevouz emotionally blank paper. Scanning mirrors to sounds like fun. Raining ground in caves for cytoplasm and texture. Although the postal conjecture thrive, the hydrogen makes icing for instance. In the end, World Peace for small Oceans and magnanimous plankton. Nevertheless, the oxytocin leaves the house from the store. Finally, the excited cactus were going sliding upwards and fish reflecting. Though they said otherwise
Have a nice sabbatical Mikey, come back only when you're ready King 🤴
2:17 Overquill: Am I a joke to you?
In regards to you taking a break, take yo time, man. Everyone needs a break and you deserve one. Enjoy taking a break and enjoy life in a chill way
Rip Technoblade
You heard of technoblade? He died
Name it Orcarath, like Orca, and Wrath
Honestly if you’re so tired of playing Pokémon I would love to see what other games and franchises you’re interested in
Enjoy your break Mikey, you more then earned it, and cant wait to see what you will work on when your break is over.
Mental health is very important, so good for you to recognize and take action towards preventing a burn-out.   As you said, see it as a sabbatical and make sure you try and enjoy it the entire time.
Till we meet again, Mikey paisen!!! Goodluck and enjoy your much needed break.🙏.
I've seen some other youtubers go for different focuses. Such as a One Piece Youtuber also doing Hunter X Hunter videos. That might not be a bad idea. Have Pokemon as a main attraction but get to unleash your creativity with another type of thing. Might help
Take your time and take care of yourself Mikey 💛💙 We'll be here when you get back 😊
As a teacher idk how anyone survives without summer break so enjoy your time off and sleep in!
Shiny yamask is so cool but over the last 3 days I got 5 shinies latias, blacephalon, eevee, relicanth, spoink they are all random
yes
What hit you
Mikey, you've been my favorite PokeTuber for years and I have always looked forward to your videos. If you think you are reaching that point, take a break we will all be here when you decide to return. You inspired me to become a PokeTuber my first video almost finished, so take care of yourself, well all love you and want the best for you.
Have a great vacation Mikey, Hope you are able to enjoy it, glad you are taking the time to look after yourself :D
Even the sweetest things become bitter with time. We understand, take  it easy and have a nice long rest, don't let that crown fall, King!
In the future grunty voi Will steal Michael Channel and rename It grunty voi channel
I’ve been watching your content for only about the last year and appreciate all the content you’ve made while dealing with burnout. Enjoy your sabbatical and we will all be excited for when you return. In the mean time this finally gives me an excuse to binge a lot of your old content including Pokemon Talk!
Take as long as you need to take a break, you definitely deserve it. We'll be right here awaiting your return
Have a good vacation. I hope it's energizing for you.
Poor Mikey. Hope you feel better soon
Well, I hope Scarlet/Violet can become the vehicle to take your content to the next level, which it could be if it lives up to the hype
I hate lechonk, my favorite newbie is smoliv
DR.SQUATCH IS A SCAM, THEY REJECT THE PROMO CODES!
The stuff you said towards the end about wanting to focus more on your plays channel more than your main one is honestly something I feared when I was moving from my main account to this one and that’s because for a while I was very interested in doing stuff on that other channel but then I decided that after I was done with all the fire emblem path of radiance game plays and mods, I decided to move over to this one where this would be considered my main channel from now on, and even then I don’t really upload as much so I very much understand what you’re talking about and I do agree I had a sabbatical in regards to a lot of my other social media and so I definitely understand the need for a sabbatical.
Have a good month/month and a half off YouTube 👋
Just watched the ending, and as I’m sad you won’t be around for awhile, you absolutely deserve it. I’ve been watching for 6 years, and you and John make my weekends better. Please go enjoy your time off, we all will miss you and love your work, please come back when you’re ready and continue to do what you love. Bye Mikey!
I completely understand getting burnout. It’s good that you decided to take a break before it got to being the worst it could be.
No offence but you kinda missed the chance to make orcane a arcane orca
I understand bye.
Yo why you post it at 1 am!?!!???????!?!?!
ahhh i know everyone has said this but all the poke designs are super cute !!! have a nice yt break also!!!
I have a tradition of watching this at California Adventure when my family goes on Cars and I don’t.
Most of us hopefully understand I do though so go get your break I know how hard it is go take a break but also in this video and every video you made makes me happy even with bad news of a YouTuber passing away these videos made me happy you’ve done well for your community
Good luck mikey in your break we will miss you!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Have you ever considered playing a wider variety of games? Like maybe instead of focusing solely on pokemon you make content for other games (maybe like other nintendo games?) that way you don't get sick of your job or the games you play? either way I will continue to watch your content and I hope your passion is reignited!
it’s honestly fine that you’re taking a break, everyone deserves breaks, especially you. we always can rewatch your videos. have a good break mikey!
NOT GRUNTY BOI USING THE SHAMPOO ON THE CAP!! 💀
Have a good break! You definitely deserve it.
*skips forward every few seconds* “month” “month-“ “monthly.”
guys i have learned something dont take your favorite youtuber for granted anyday you or them can die
Can't think how I'm going to manage without my weekly fix of Grunty Boi...
We will be here ready to laugh when you come back
I don't trust him he doesn't like castform anymore
little does mikey know that he made a goat Sleipnir (a norse horse with 6 legs
Take care Mikey! I've been watching your videos for years and I can't wait to see what changes you're gonna make when you come back. Have a wonderful sabbatical.
I just realized ever since Mikey got a beard, he was a simp, so all the bearded poke-tubers are simps now.
you really deserve this keep up da good work bro
I love how the title is just “more Lechonk”
Take as long as you want big man, we'll still be here for more poke-knowledge and fun when you return. Enjoy your break cause we ain't going nowhere
Good luck on your break Mikey! i am gonna bingewatch your vids and pokemon talk!
hope you have a good time on your break :) stay safe, stay healthy, stay awesome
I’m watching this to cheer myself up because somehow I’m the last person on the internet to figure out one of my favorite minecraft YouTuber’s is dead
No Worries King , We Will Wait For You Here Whenever You Are Ready To Cone Back , Take A Break , After Watching You All Thess Years , U Need One 🤝  Love From India  Love From Your Community ❤️
enjoy your break mikey  it's important to take breaks once in a while and we all understand how important it is
Sad to hear we won’t be seeing you for a bit, but so glad you’re talking a well deserved break. Enjoy it and take care!!
Michael you earned the break! Also did..did grunty boy just wink at me..?
OH NO ANOTHER MANDJTV THIRST TRAP
take a break Mikey, you deserve it after all the great content you've posted this year, and last year, and a lot of other years. :P
Something is telling me that that the new legendaries will be dragon/rock and dragon/steal or electric
9:37 "I've gotten shinies in Sword and Shield, but that was intentionally Masuda Method hunting." That's not the Masuda Method, dude. Anything that involves going out and hunting isn't Masuda Method. The Masuda Method is a breeding technique.
almost at 2 mill subs
Take all the time you need, Michael.
HE DIDNT NOTICE squIRTLE
I liked at the shower montage.....  Grunty boi you free this Saturday?
Take a long break. You deserve it
@MandJTV    I just realized that people are going to do a Lechonk only challenge in Scarlett and Violate
Ya boy is low key swole 👍👍💪
Can’t wait until you return and hope you have a nice break!
17:19
Obviously the new legendaries are just Charizard + the new gimmick of the game. (sarcasm)
Take as much a break as you need + 2 weeks more just in case
Have a nice break, Mikey! You've earned it with how many years you've given me enjoyment. 👍
Take a break man we appreciate what you have already given us
Wishing you a restful and fulfilling sabbatical! We’ll see you when you’re ready!
I get you, don't want a repeat of you burning yourself out on Pokemon Talk so take the break that you need. For sure, I feel the sting of burnout, happens with me & so many things I love like just recently, Safari Week hit & I happened to catch covid just before it started so I was self isolating during Safari Week which meant I could just spend my time at home hunting in the safari so every day for like the entire day that whole week, I was shiny hunting in either the Great Marsh in Platinum, Pearl, or Brilliant Diamond or in the Safari Zone in SoulSilver, Ruby, or LeafGreen. I was usually running two or three games at a time & found four shinies during that week but OH BOY! I currently don't want to go back to shiny hunting for quite a while because when it's all you do constantly for a week & you're sick on top of that, you just do not want to go back during that recovery period. It's not as deep as trying to run yourself like a content making machine for so many years but it's like a tiny little sample at the ice cream parlor so I understand where you're coming from, I've been there with other things, that was just my recent example. Take good care of yourself & best of luck with unpacking. Suppose that's another WTF happened to the floor? moment since it's a new floor.
in terms of the sabbatical, would we be able to get updates on the community tab on how ur doin, just so we know youre alright, mentally?
Enjoy some R&R man its always nice   to take a break
#15 on trending!!!!
or ... or ... oregon! yes we have found the name that is clearly the best

No clap* clap* Mikey 🥲
Enjoy your break Mikey!! Take your time n relax
dont care that you video stops i watch you for aspitpiay and Team sky
Rip Pokémon talk
Hello Mikey, before i begin my comment id like to say that we share the same name which has always made me happy. But with that out of the way, let's get this underway. I've been a loyal follower and subscriber to your channel for almost 2 years and every video you upload gets an instant like and ever since i randomly found your channel in my 'Recommended' vids, i have enjoyed and loved each vid you make. But this break is quite sad to hear about but if you need to take this hiatus to rejuvenate yourself and reignite your excitement to make new content then ill gladly wait however long you take for your new videos and no matter how long it takes, the moment i get the notification of your new video when you return, im dropping everything and watching it to see how you changed from before and after your break. But all in all, I hope you enjoy your time off and I await your next video. Till next time MandJTV!
Mikey: I'm just feeling a bit burnt out. Don't panic, the content will be back shortly.  People who remember Pokemon Talk's cancellation: *Vietnam Flashbacks*
yes mandjtv content on my bday les go
Thumbs up for the grunty boi clogging the shower montage
Mikey, you have really earned your break I enjoy watching your vids no matter how long the take. I love to see your smile, it makes me feel happy And i only wish for 1 thing, that you aren’t quitting yt And Yaveltal, Arkoos, and if it’s not 100% accurate it’s 50% accurate will live on forever. And now, more creativity will hit you, as you rest to continue forever. I hope you see this poem (sorta) and are happy reading it
my man grunty boy put shampoo on his hat
Lechonk should evolve into Lechad
No more meme videos ffs
:c
Dam grunty boy leave us some women
Gunty boi not Again
if no one makes a 100% 50% meme from the banner comment near the beginning, I will be sad
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
Wish u the bast of luck and see u on the ather side know matter what 😁
33% acuracy is less than 100 Therefor the icon is 50% acurate
14:46 I hate to say it dude but nogstin already made a orca Pokémon called war and and it’s being made into an actual fake mom game so just be careful cause people may think you are copying him
“That’s only 33% accuracy grade on that.”  Well, if it’s not 100% accurate…
Poke- AHHH MY EYEEEEE
You really deserve the break, it's good to take time for yourself :D
17:32 Mikey: "I gotta admit, they look alot better"  Me: "Am I not seeing the same thing as you ? Those are NOT pokemons and honestly look freakish"  (no offence to the original artist, just personal opinions)
4:08 Melonie is frickin MILF status what on Earth was game freak thinking
oh, hey, yamask was my first shiny too!
HEY mikey you know you can alaways take a break beacause you still have your own life we all respect youre decision we all love you
I hope you have a great vacation make sure you relax a lot see you soon.
Makes me wonder when Black Sabbath will return from there *Sabbatical!?*
It's always good to take a break when you need it :)  Get some rest and enjoy your time off
I found a full odds, no shiny charm Sneasel (which Weavile is my favorite Pokémon) within the first 20 min of me playing swsh. What sucks is that my switch broke and I lost that shiny…
i swear this month is getting worse and worse, first technoblade dies :( and now mikey is taking a break for a month or so
Love your vids take don’t overwork
when u realise that smoliv is big for an olive
#17 on trending
he posted at 1am my time
Jokes on you arseus is spelled with c in Brazil
Before you go dude I just want you to know you are a really amazing guy
Damn, 17th on trending
Good on you for knowing how to take care of yourself
yo, good job on trending mikey!
Wasn’t expecting a thirst trap today
at this point grunty boi should become that one friend that raids ur fridge in the middle of the night just because they can
everyone deserves a break enjoy it! HAIL YEAH!!!
-1 month only!!!??? Take longer break
Please Mikey take a break, we love your videos but you need a break
Mandjtv and gruntyboys relation  Past: enemy!!!! Now: best friend
Be safe, take your time Mikey! <3
Hello Mikey, I understand how work can be hard and stuff so it's good to take a break once in a while. Sad I didn't get into the meme review buy oh well. I love your videos and channel so I hope you have a good break and will see you in the next video.
Take all the time you need Mikey! Your mental health is important and we want you to take care of yourself!!
A opossum Pokémon! That makes me wonder if he’s seen my comment on his Community Tab post for animals and mythological creatures that we’d like to see as Pokémon. I said how I’d love to see a opossum Pokémon with an Ability called “Play Dead” which powers up the Pokémon’s Ghost type Moves, exactly like Dhelmise with Steelworker.
That’s a nice shower
Bring back team sky merch
Yay great birthday gift Mikey not going to upload😅😅😅😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 but if he isn’t going to upload cuz he doesn’t want to it’s completely fine
His banner is only fifty percent accurate
I hope you find what you're looking for, and much more on your break! I've enjoyed every single video since I've found the channel early this year, and had a hard time believing HOW there was so much of it coming out! Enjoy your break, dude!!
Damn is Grunty Boy going to overtake Mikey as the hottest Poketuber? These promos gonna make me act up
I just remembered that Lechonk is not a Starter Pokémon. The memes fooled me for a bit there.
Mikey's on sabbatical, honey
Hhhahah
Am I the only one whoever watches mikey for the grunty boy skits.
Enjoy your break! Burnout is never fun and it can become quite the issue so I’m happy you’re doing this now.
Mikey: it is 33% accurate to the banner Me: really 33% that is not real there is only 100% and 50% accurate
You deserve a well-deserved break and your videos were awesome
Slaking following you as your buddy in Pokémon Go is also horrifying. I would know I made it my buddy and got scared when I saw it running.
Take you break. You deserve it king.
You will not be allowed to make videos until you are sufficiently unbernedout don’t make me force you
you're one of my 3-4 favourite Pokemon-related content creators, I love your videos, and if it's good for you, it'll be good for us. you've worked for this channel for so many years and you deserve a break, so have a great time however you want to spend it and when you finaly come back, I'll be incredibly hyped
I understand the burnout thing. I started my current channel (which is just song covers) a few years ago for fun, but it's been hard to maintain, with my day job hours being all over the place and liable to change at any time, and also COVID ruining most of my motivation to do anything for most of 2020 (also I work at a grocery store so once lockdowns started I started having to work a lot more hours suddenly). I've also been focusing more on my writing, which is what I actually WANT to do as a career. It's been hard to balance all that stuff, and I think I too have been becoming a workhorse as a result. So I will probably need to take a break soon. I need to recharge, watch TV shows I'm behind on, play video games I want to play (case in point: I got Nintendo Switch Sports not long after it came out in April, and it's July and I still haven't played it), etc. Or if I do write, do something easier. I did that for Camp NaNo April this year. Since I just finished a novel manuscript in March, I just wrote a fanfic for Camp, and was surprised to see how easily things flowed. So once I finish my current project I'll probably do something similar for at least a month. Not just to relax, but like you I also need to make some branding decisions, since I'm transitioning into more of a promotion stage as an author, and I failed miserably at building a platform last time I tried ~2009 cause I had no clue what I was doing.  Anyways hope you enjoy your sabbatical, and in the meantime I'll probably watch your old Let's Plays and such. I'm watching the B2W2 Metronome Randomizer Nuzlocke series right now. Aside from the amusement of following PM7's absurd bad luck streak, it's made me want to go back and finish the Gen 5 games cause I never finished them (to be fair when they came out I was in like my last year-ish of college, and also working part-time, so I was very busy). Tho TBH I've been focusing on my 3DS more than my Switch recently anyway since the eShop is shutting down soon.  Also the Galarian Runerigus thing reminded me of how they label regional evolutions (like Runerigus) like they are regional forms in the TCG, even though they are not regional forms of previous Pokémon, like the Hisuian starters or Alolan Raichu, but actual new Pokémon. I find this rather annoying for some reason and I have no idea why they decided to do it like that.
hi I know i'm a bit late but I just wanted to say that it's completely fine if you take a break for some months or even years, you have given us so much so it's only fair that you get to have a break and just know that even if you want to quit youtube and find something new do it don't think about us or if we are going to be disappointed in the end this is your channel and your life and that shouldn't be affected by us.
take all the time you need we all support you 😉
Maybe taking a step back from Pokémon on the Plays channel might help. Playing a new game like Legend of Zelda/Kirby or making some more Minecraft content can help remedy your creative satisfaction problem. As your fans, we all like to see new things!
I really like your videos and the effort you put in making them. But I don't want to watch a project that you are not enjoying it, so take all the time you need. I'll be looking foward for your return.
You don’t see this level of honesty these days in other YouTubers, and it’s so so appreciated! Take as much time as you need, your mental health and life are more important, but do come back okay? 😜
Bruh I'm gonna have like-- 5 or 6 cosmoth and name them all after HK characters from/linked to the moth tribe, canon and oc alike  (Seer, Markoth, Thistlewind, Radiance, -Shimmerwish, Whorlstone)-
love the content and look forward to your return, whenever that may be.
😂 At least Grunty Boi didn’t break into Michael’s shower this time.
When you tried to be cool at your intro but you hurt yourself
Take as long as you need you deserve a break for all the amazing content you put out. I'm just hoping you eventually come back
Also, glad you can see your burnout getting there! Love your content and look forward to when you get back!
Take care of yourself, man
But spoink is sleeping
I thought the box art legendary was going to be a mega blaziken beacause of the feet
Take great break do keep us updated in instragram!!❤❤
I’m traumatized x2 now from the promo
Woah, look at Dartoad's code-name (sorry I don't know what to call them, they're those things like Pikachu being the Small Mouse pokemon)
I'm so glad you're taking time off for yourself. Burnout sucks. You better not be replacing YouTube work with house work though haha! Take as long as you need. I'm a huge fan, and I'd rather a happy Mikey that doesn't upload much than a miserable Mikey who works himself stupid.
That's why I thought even I, that I'm just watching your gameplays keep questioning myself "how he can play pokemon over and over and over again?" you came up with different gimmicks, ideas, challenges and a really really good script, but I think htat you should take a break, maybe try another game outside of pokemon like minecraft, fall guys idk something that you can post while being fresh, you could try Legend of Zelda, that could be funny, whatever just keep being you and stay safe men, you are the best
The sexy shower with shampoo on the outside of grunty bois hat 😂😂😂😂 Next merch, Mikey- Grunty Boy DAKIMAKURA. ...holding a bar of Dr Squatch betwixt his pecs. 🤣
Hope you enjoy your time off a much needed break for you love your videos.
It's good that you're being proactive when it comes to taking a break. I hope you enjoy yourself, and I look forward to whenever you decide to come back!
First technoblade dies then Mickey leaves! WHY MIKEY, WHY!!!
hey it takes alot to just make something especially yt vids, take your time mikey im sure everyone will understand
Rest well mate
We love you Mikey. Take your time. We’ll be here. We’ve plenty to entertain ourselves with here. We’ll keep the light on.
mikey pls react to moxeis art of your mons when you are back the look realy *oficil and i think you would like it
Everyone deserves a break to recharge. At the end of the day your health is what important.
Take all the break you need Mikey. We love you and you need to take a break sometimes. Burnout is a serious thing that you need to avoid, so enjoy your break!
Please make a reaction video to Moxie's drawings of your Pokemon designs
12:35 DUDE what if they need a leader like Volcarona to act as their sun so they don't fly straight up??? O-O
Hope you enjoy your time off Michael.  Everybody needs a break now and then.  Looking forward to your eventual return.
Why is Mikey’s merch always limited
Take all the time in the world, lots of love. I always have fun watching ur videos
Keeping the notifications on for the plays and this channel for your return. Enjoy your break good sir you deserve it!
You earned it mikey (my bad i meant mickey :)
Maybe u can play pokemon fan games lik Insurance ,  Xenoverse... or u could play New games at Thé future
Enjoy your break mate, looking forward to your future content
Hey hope things are well, Mikey!
Mikey, it is not Lechonk, it is Lechonk. ( la sh o n k)
I will miss Mikey, but he deserves a break
take your time king
If you’re calling what you’ve been, making maintenance then all i can say is as I’ve known for a while you’re one hell of a creator. So take you’re time enjoy yourself and I look forward to seeing the next phase of your creativity!
17:32 Okay, Incineroar is literally just him walking on all fours. There is literally no difference. Also, Intelion looks horrendous.   Now tell me how Chesnaught's shield would work, or how it would fit the brawler theme of rpg heroes.
Enjoy your break dude,hope you'll have fun
Rip Mikey's eye.  p.s. nice hoodie mikey
U HEARD HIM 1M SUBS ON HIS GAMEING CHANNEL AND QUICKLY
Michael, I am a high school science teacher and university professor. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY understand the desire and need for a sabbatical. My suggestion, from experience, for the first week go see people you haven't been able to see  and do things you don't normally do. If ideas or plans pop into your head, jot them down and then LEAVE THEM ALONE. Burnout takes a lot longer than a month to solve, but a break where you can reflect and evaluate will go a long way.  Good luck!
Everyone LOVES Jalamodo
I’m really proud of you for taking your sabbatical! It takes a lot of confidence in yourself to stand up for yourself and say you need a break. I can’t wait to hear how your break went!
Why? I worked my butt off for my prevo for Orcane and I can’t be featured!
You deserve a nice long break
Hey guys the banners 50% accurate
Long break, you deserve it! relax! Burnout is horrible and I hope you can get some rest in.
So... does Grunty Boy have an Only Fans? Asking for a friend... And also, im sure everyone understands why you need a break Mikey, and im also sure ppl will still be here waiting for you when you decide to come back. You're an awesome talented person, give yourself this time to rest and comeback even more handsome and funny them you already are 😁, gonna miss you until them 😫!!!
Not Mikey moving just to have an excuse to show us his abs again
"Wouldn't it be cool if it could inflate?" wait wait wait wait wait, so like an Anole's and like a tire?! o__O
We all need a break once and a while. Hope it is good and can't wait to see your content back on my home page :)
14:26 Pokémon community please don’t kill me for this but toungus from yo Kai watch
I'm glad you're taking a break before you completely burn out. Take care of yourself! We will miss your amazing videos, but will be waiting when you get back. :)
The moment pokemon sc&vi comes out Im gonna catch a lechonk and call him technoblade, if anybody watches this comment and thinks he would do the same like this comment. Lets see how many techchonks are we gonna make.
take as much break as you need to get 100% energized bc we all know what happens if its 99%
12:37 Does anyone else think cosmoth looks like the radiance from hollow knight? I have no idea why I thought this.
Mikey: "I swear this hoodie is NOT a threat to safety unless you're stupid like I am" Me: Well crap  Edit: Grunty boi's wink tho  Edit 2: ENGLISH TIME!!!! The arc phone sounds like "park" or "dark" where it's a *hard c.* Arceus is pronounced either ARKOOS if you're an MandJTV fan or for most pokemon fans, are-see-us. The reason for this is because of the rule where the letter c becore e, i, or y is an s sound, like in the words sit or hiss. Example words would be celery for c before e, cinder for c before i, and cyan for c before y.  So to conclude, Arc phone is pronounced  /ɑrk foʊn/, and Arceus is pronounced /aar·see·uhs/
Everybody gangsta until Grunty Boi starts putting shower gel on his hat.
At the beginning of the video where he said he was gonna take a break for a month or two me: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   At the end of the video when I’ve listened to everything me: ok, I understand
take all the time you need Mikey you have so many great videos that I still have to watch so I'll still be on the channel while you're on a break
Take a break man. You deserve it
"me waching the sponsor": NOOOO GRUNTY BOY!
So glad a creative is taking a break before burnout actually happens.  Once met a guy who gave himself burnout so severe he gave himself a medical condition and became disabled.  Too often we humans ignore things that are brain problems and forget that the brain controls everything.  That's the last thing we want to break down!
Enjoy your break Mikey! Everyone deserves a break. Can’t wait for your return and new content!
Mikey just lend grunty boy the channel. I’m kidding but have a good break Mikey you deserve it
How about some merch for your 18 custom ‘Mons?
You should make megas for your fakemon
Oh my goodness!!! I can't believe mine made it in! It was truly a joy to rework your designs Mikey! I had such fun doing it, thank you for all the love on them!!! 💗💗
1:56 to 2:02 if its not 100% accurate its 50% accurate
Great video as always, Mikey! Take as much time as you need to recover mentally and physically (if need be)! We just want you to be happy and healthy!💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
We will be waiting for your glorious return with open arms :) Get some rest, relaxation, and recalibration for as long as you need!
18:32 magiraffe has the rinnegan
Have a nice break Mikey!!
Enjoy your break, you deserve it!
Can someone please explain the Fuecoco Amoonguss joke I dont get it. Also Mikey have a nice break you deserve it.
I've never been 5hours to a MandJTV episode
Take your time to rest, just check in with us every now and then so we know you’re alright. We’ll be here whenever you choose to come back!
1:59 if it’s not 100 present acurate it’s 30 percent accurate
Some advice as you reassess your goals. Think about who watches your videos and why. I submit that there are 2 groups: people who are interested in Pokemon and people who are interested in you and your personality. Of course everyone has at least a mild interest in Pokemon, but I would guess that a large percentage of your active followers came for the interesting Pokemon content, but stayed because of the good vibes you exude. You are an excellent entertainer. I would watch you play other games. I would love to see you and John do an art challenge. Don't feel pigeon-holed into doing only Pokemon stuff. Keep doing it to maintain the brand at some level, but at this point your subscriber-base is established enough that you can diversify and try new things.
Why I’m honoured
I have realized that recently, Mikey has done the sponsor right after gruntyboi is mentioned in aspitpiay.
Take as much time as you need Mikey.
1) next time goggles. Wear your goggles so you don't hit your eye.  2) the memes are so good this month 3) Take as much time as you need. I know what it feels to be burned out and it can take a toll on your mental and physical health. Enjoy the break and we'll all be here when you come back. And if when miss you we'll just rewatch the videos over and over again. I think I'm on my 5th or 6th time watching you team sky videos on play and meme review I want to say my 7th or 8th time. We will be here when you get back. Enjoy the break and congratulations on the moving to a new place. ❤️❤️
Do what is best for you. We'll be here to support whatever you decide to do when you get back.
8:09 or it could be pronounced "Arse Phone"
Enjoy your break, man. You've definitely earned it!
Enjoy Your Break Arkoos Sceptile Castform And Migty May Bless You
ive been watching your videos since 2015,  and there isn't a time where i thought your videos were not entertaining. Personally, i think you should take a break for a while and your community will miss you a lot! Thanks for the videos.
That break is a great decision and I'm glad ur not quitting see you soon have fun on your "sabbatical"
Take as much time as you need, you deserve this break. Thought I'm surprised that hadn't taken one sooner
Tomorow is my brithday so this is like a early birthday present for me
I kinda wanna design a trainer to go with one of your Pokémon, I’ll probably post it to the subreddit when I finish it!
Take all the time you need Mikey. We will be here when you come back. Be safe and don't stress.
The orcane Pokémon is a good name since I’m the bible it says came was the first ever killer and sharks and orcas have been around for a long time so it would fit
So it’s not arkoos it’s arcsoos
Good video,good memes  hope yall have a good  day
6:17 the moment we’ve all been waiting for
TAKE YOUR TIME!! We will not care at all if you decide not to post for a few weeks, a few months, or even a few years! <3
Take care of yourself, we'll be here when u come back!
MandJTV: Stops postindustrialne Me: Nooooooooooooo
you deserve a summer vacation
Mikey takes a break so John can learn the locations of all the pokemon in every game so he can win some of the competitions.
He’s gone back to grungy boy showering
Hopefully you enjoy your vacation, and life hits you hard, so focus on yourself and life, and hopefully you get better.
Oh no! He’s hooot
When you favorite video game franchise is your job, overworking can quickly make it your least favorite. Then you’re left with a series you hate and a job that revolves around it.
I made a fire starter of a Platypus
Enjoy your sabbatical Mikey. And when you come back, you'll be better than ever!
Enjoy your recharge. It’s better to take a break from a burnout that to let it become a breakdown.
Ok.. I finally recovered from the first sexy shower montage *another sexy shower montage* OH GOD Y E A H
Take your time! Hope your sabbatical is enjoyable! As far as Orcane goes, how about "Abhorca"?
regarding the sabatical: all good. Take care of yourself.
Is Team Sky finally arrived at Unova? Reply what flying type you think would the leader use to conquer the skies of Unova
Orcanus
Take a brake dude you deserve this.
I and hopefully many others will await your return and I hope this break will help stave off burnout.
play pokemon rocket edition rom hack as grunty boi
Enjoy your break!  Will just make things even more special when you come back.  Everyone ends up taking breaks once in awhile
Hopefully, your sabbatical is fulfilling. I've noticed that you don't seem to have as much energy as you used to in previous videos, and at times I've felt that your videos felt churned out without as much love put into them. I think that this break is much needed and I look forward to coming back to new, quality videos.
Dude you can take a break.. I really feel you as a person who is struggling with mental health We'll miss you ^w^❣
8:10 the RKS system kinda already proved that 5 years ago
Take all the time you need! We'll all be waiting patiently to watch your hilarious videos again
13:09 Suspiciously similar to absol's dex entry
Hey man, You deserve a break, really Having 2 channels seems very tough and even having 1 might be a bit hard. And repeating that cycle of uploading seems like you are kinda sick of it Take a break dude. We’ll wait…
lechonk is literally pig pig lol lechon oink
Smash Grunty Boi
hey take all the time you need, all your videos entertain me, after I finish watching your newsest video, I usually watch your old videos, great content all around.
You don't have to justify your decisions such as just taking a break to us Mikey, we get it, we will wait, take all the time you need, we'll still be here when you get back.  We're your fans, so if you gotta step back, those of us who aren't toxic people are going to understand and go "okay, that's fine, we will wait and just watch old stuff or other stuff until you get back," there's no reason you ever need to ever justify yourself to anyone about taking care of your mental or physical health. Have fun on your sabbatical!~
Good luck michael, have a good rest. Aquí estaremos esperando el contenido que desees compartir con nosotros :3
Creativity does not mix well with consistency, so yeah, take a break.
As a creator, I definitely understand that struggle you're going through, Mikey. Burnout is a big issue with creating anything, so take the time you need to rest and recharge the creative energy because when you do, you'll come back and make some of the best content you can
is trainin just a machop trained by koga?
Take a break mikey, you deserve it because you have worked hard and the break is well deserved. Well enjoy your break and work on you, the fans can wait because you need to work on you!  HAIL YEAH!!!
Take your time Mikey! No rush from us. You do what you need to do to get yourself into a better headspace and creator space. We'll always be here for you.
thank you for all the kind comments :) I will do my best to take full advantage of this time off so I can come back fully energized to make the best content I can!
I'm fine with you taking a break as long as you don't quit because your one of my favorite youtubers i have watched you ever since the first pokemon talk video so have a good break
Les go these meme reviews are coming out faster than a month now
Mikey I love your videos and I really want you to enjoy your break I will be here when you come back no matter how long
Take all the time you need to recover and think over how you're gonna do things. I hope this sabbatical goes just as you hope and that you are fully recharged whenever you come back. ^_^
Don’t worry Mikey, you more than deserve a break.
cosmoth seems like it absolutely needs to be kept in the company of a volcarona at all times
That jacket looks sick
9:18 “4x damage” and “4x super effective” are different. You mean 2x super effective, or 4x normal damage
7:21 dual is spelt right, how else do you spell it?
Mikey so this would happen in the future may I suggest you do what another Poké-tuber that I watch bird keeper Toby does. He takes at least a month off to Rebrand his channel each year. With all the channels you do that might be a good idea for you to do that as well. I'm a huge fan of what you do here on YouTube.
Mikey have a good summer, we'll see yah when you come back enjoy your break
Mikey you just got lasik and you’re trying to take them out?!
Hey man take a break you deserve it you have posted great videos for a long time and aspitpiay is the perfect way to end it see you later injoy the break
Falscourge is still my favorite of his fakemon but I really like the pepper and prophesee
My heart sunk when he first said “burnout”
I’ve been a fan for a good long while even before this account. Have a fantastic break and until next time pokefans GOTTA CATCH EM ALL
I completely understand why you are leaving for a while, and I think it’s great that you are taking time for yourself, but will you be back by scarlet and violet’s release
enjoy your break, Mikey! You've definitely earned it.
I literally have that same exact towel lol 6:46
I hope you have a good vacation Mikey you deserve it. After all the happiness you brought us you deserve some as well.
19:27 LOOK MA I MADE IT!!!
I agree that you need a break and you should have taken it a while ago
You’ve consistently put out quality content, so take all the time you need for a break.  We’ll see when you get back 👋
Orcane could be called “Orcrash”
Lechonk is single handedly the best Pokemon name and it isn't even close.  The next best is Overqwil, and that's also second by a lot.
Take as long as you need Mikey my dude. We'll all still be here when you get back. And I 100% understand the break and the writing thing as I myself write stories. Sometimes a story can take me days even weeks or months to write just one chapter because I can't get the chapter down in a way I like.
i was playing sheild for the first time and got a shiny heatmor so that was neet
Take all the time you need
Gogoat = go-g.o.a.t
Take care Mikey. And enjoy taking some time off, you've definitely earned it and deserve it!!! It was so fun to see so much fanart, and I'm inspired to do some too!
Have a great break! We will be here when you get back.
take as long as a break as you need mikey, recharge, plan, relax, anything you need. we'll be here when your ready to come back.
Mikey:its only 33% accurate All the fans:I’m gonna say it.I’m gonna do it … IF ITS NOT 100 PERCENT ACCURATE
my man grunty boi giving a new meaning to "shower cap"
I am not a native speaker for English so please explain the lechonk name thing
the Gen 8 "hot people" meme not including Raihan is a TRAVESTY.
Take the break you need. Take it as long as you need. I, myself, am in mental hospital right now because I stepped too far and burned out. Don't let it happen. Heal up and get back fun and happynesa with work. <3
Yu gi oh has the Egyptian gods  Pokemon has early route memelords Bidoof wooloo and lechonk
The next video will be pokemon 👏👏 meme review  I agree with mikey aswell
Take your time
I thought you where actually not going to post anymore😅
Day 2 Of Asking: You should make a Grunty Boi version of Mytey! Please blow this up so Mikey sees this.
Isn't Doomoose dex entry too similar to Absol's?
I love your videos and please enjoy your break!!!
Could we see you in collaborations like with pkm7 on your break
Take all the time you need. We’ll all be here for you when you’re ready.
I would die for Cosmoth
Mike/grunty boi keeps making the sexy shower montages because he's unsure about making an only fans Tell me I'm wrong It's also the REAL reason he's taking some time off
I just hope Lechonk's evolution is good in battle like Dubwool.  Like the only physical attacking Pokémon that can beat it are Zacian and the two kung-fu bear legendaries.  Dubwool is a real tank.  And can hit hard with Body Press.  Hopefully Lechonk's Evo gets a battle gimmick too.  Need more viable normal types for my normal gym team.  Lol.
Nice new bathroom
I did not need to see Grunty Boi showering   again... LMAO
Are Your Eyes OK Mr.Groth?
HAVE A GREAT BREAK MIKEY!! We will be here when you get back!!!
HAVE A GREAT BREAK MIKEY!! We will be here when you get back!!!
Hey you need a break just take a break
Inteleon is worse when at all fours man your heretic
Red only for  Jota grass starter
THANK YEW MIKEY! Seriously, appreciate all your hard work and opinions. You’re an incredibly likable guy with a lot of knowledge and passion for what you do (even if you haven’t felt it) hoping this break brings inspiration and a fresh renewal to you!
rip technoblade :(
Enjoy your break mikey, your health, both mental and physical, is far more important than consistent video uploads
Noooo 😭😭
You’re the man Mikey, relax and recharge! You deserve it, we’ll be here when you return!
Entirely incorrect on the definition of “sabbatical” A sabbatical is EXPLICITLY for the purpose of doing research and is in no way supposed to be a vacation!
lechonk is the new bidoof
Enjoy your break, Mikey 😁 Come back when you're ready and motivated again. I've been taking time off myself from my creative outlet and not pushing myself like I had. I can't blame you for feeling the way you are, we all get like this. We'll be here once you're back 😁
I always wonder why is it called aspitpiay
Aspitpiay mikey got hit in the eye
Orcane new name orcannon
I got shiny in sword on day 1. Full ods before 1st gym.
if castform was a little dragon, then my theory would have been that castform would totally have been baby rayquaza, and u cant evolve it for balancing reasons
Those who need breaks should take them so if you need a break then take one for how ever long it takes we will be here when you return
I definitely support you in taking this break and look forward to seeing you next month!!!
Will you ever make another aspitpiay video that is not a meme review?
see you in a month. we will all be waiting
You live in Texas if you are then is it raining in your area cause it’s raining in Houston
Relax and come back!
My first random shiny is qwilfish on sword
Michael: its only a 33% accuracy Everyone else: IF ITS NOT 100% ACCURACY-
Rest up Mikey♡ we love ya! we'll be here when you come back☆
sexy shower scene 2: the sexyness prevails
I actual think Chestnaut is the only one that looks better bipedal.
Enjoy your break 😄
You are my favrot
i will miss you mikey you have brung joy to me. :(
You deserve this. I’ll miss you, and so will a lot of people, but you need this and should take a break for as long as you want
So we've basically lost Mikey. Great...
This made me very sad because I have only been watching for a few years and it reminds me of multiple YouTubers that I watched that stopped doing YouTube so big sad
time to ultimately find out that my drawings and time were in vain  i have just ultimately found out that my drawings and time were in vain :)
Enjoy your break Mikey, after all these years of work you deserve one. Hope to see you soon on YouTube.
My first random shiny was a wooloo and I got it my second day of having the game
17:37 Sobble was like Pikachu it can move on all fours but it's on 2 legs and drizzile is on 2 legs anyways
No one is going to point out that we got ANOTHER bath Scene with grunti boi………not saying I hate it 😳
2:00 actually it’s 50%
I NEED FLOPFLAP!!! ITS SO CUTE!!!!
Maybe DOOMOOSE could be Absol's non mega evolution..... I mean the dex entry sorta matches as does the design
I think we deserve a proper intro by now.. not just Pewdiepie's with a few words changed..
grunty boi made me gay /hj
Take a break my guy you deserve it
Overqwil is still the best Pokémon name ever, Lechonk got nothing Overqwil
Mikey's off for summer break.
Enjoy your sabbatical Mikey!! You have been consistently amazing for years and you should enjoy what you do , everyone will still be here when you feel your ready.
Thanks for at least telling us, not a lot of people are comfortable with telling others or don’t fell like doing that and it can be upsetting but understandable, still though, thanks for telling us and enjoy your break!
He skiped my meme that got 1k upvotes because it had among us on it 😪
Take your time with your break! Use all the time for yourself that you need. YouTube can wait, we'll all be here and waiting for whenever you are ready. You deserve the rest, thank you for all the content you put out!!
4:01 how does spoink sleep then?
I under stand that you are burned out  it makes sense. But i have no idea how the youtuber jelly makes 2 vids every day and is not burned down. But please come back soon i love your content.
It's really healthy to recognize the burnout before it consumes you. I've dealt with it myself and you def deserve a break!   It was fun seeing everyone's interpretations of your pokemon! I had fun working on my version. Enjoy your break!
Just come back before Violet & Scarlet drop and it'll be fine. Enjoy your break, it is well deserved.
Watch moxie 2D newest video he redrew all of your Pokémon
Completely understand your need for a break. We all need one every now and then. Enjoy yourself Mikey
Hey Mandjtv i have  a idea for your pokemon game fact and this is the idea what is the best pokémon in every route
4:00 you do not have to ruin it
also lockstin made a pokemon called warcane
I love that ive been hearing about more content creators taking mental health breaks. In a business where consistency is key i imagine its hard to keep up the passion with strict deadlines and pressure. Take however long you need. We will be here when you get back. Much love and respect mikey. You take care my man!
You best be coming back!. Because if you don't then NO SHINYS FOR YOU!. I hope your well and look after yourself!
Take your much deserved sabbatical Mikey, you deserve it. We love you and await your return. 👏👏👏
Grunty Boy is so sexy 😍
My first shiny ever was hatched out of an egg because I need the baby Pokémon of Zoroark! 😅 P.S. And yes it was in black 2 and white 2
Take all the time off you need Mikey! I absolutely love your Pokemon Meme review videos and when you are ready to come back, myself and a million+ others will be thrilled to watch your next videos whenever that day is! Enjoy yourself and RECHARGE 😁
It really sounds like a break will be good for you. Take care, we'll be here when you get back!
The comic with Team Sky Mikey and Grunty Boy definitely needs to test my theory if all versions of Mikey playing thru Johto would still simp for Karen, to which I blame none of em for.
2:01  you mean 50% accurate
Hello friend! Can’t remember when I started keeping tabs on your channel (I think it was like…2016 or something when I was a sophomore in college myself and sun and moon hype was a thing), but I just wanted to say cheers to your mental health! Your energy is a welcome phenomenon in the community; I’m glad to have found your channel, and am excited that you’re getting ready to take some personal time!
Good for you in taking care of yourself! I hope your break good well.
You deserve the break
You deserve a break! Self Care is important 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 Your fans will be here when you’re ready to come back
L I've gotten three wild shinies in Sword.
14:50 Orcatrops would be a good name.
Yeah, take a break you foolishly foolish fool! It's either  that or have your video quality  degrade alongside   your mental health. Congratulations by the way on being one of  if not  the only channel where your sponsor presentations are so entertaining i actually  hope one happens.
I'v been a subscriber since the first pokerap so a long time a gp and if i can say somthing is that its better for you to upload videos in a longer period of time lets say a video for tow weeks maybe it wont give you as much sponserships but it would gove you more time to reacharge from video to video and thats more importent
(2:49) They have to say that you’re fine but you’re not really fine…..
Im not going to put pressure, but what if you tried games other than Pokémon? Like a game you would enjoy playing? Anyways, enjoy your break.
Stay Healthy and take your time :) I will look forward to your videos, whenever they come :)
Mikey your videos are awesome and I could tell that you would be a hard worker so you take your break and enjoy your relaxation.
Guys that banner is 50% accurate;)
Shower reveal 😊
Take as much time as you need, my dude.
Good videooo
This video’s sponsorship portion was one of the funniest yet—
Even Emile, Chuggaaconroy, takes breaks every so often. And there times he has to take off because he gets sick.  Don’t work yourself too hard. If you need the break, take it. Fans will be here when you get back.
i quit life now that hes taking a break ill arise from the dead when he posts again
you seem like you need a break from youtube
Grunty man in the shower 😳
Nnooooooooo
We love you Mikey, you take a very very well earned break my dude and we will be anxiously awaiting your return
Anyone else who did GCSEs within like the past 5-10 years and studied A Christmas Carol also get ptsd when falscorge's pokedex entry said golden idol
i love this “sexy shower montage” way better 🤣🤣🤣
We understand that you need a break everyone does sometimes so let yourself have a break enjoy it c ya soon! 😉
13:21 why doesn't that exist in pokemon already. It looks so good!!
Enjoy your time off Mikey, your health, mental, emotional or physical comes before the channels.
Please have a nice break. See you in a month or so.
Re: the end,  Im a teacher. In a lot of ways I relate to YouTubers. My job is creatively demanding, on a time line, requires lots of planning and back-end work, and is only worth it when it’s fulfilling.  If I didn’t have summers off to recharge and get re-inspired, there’s no way I could do my job effectively. I would have quit by now. I hope this sabbatical is restful, productive, and fun for you. Humans NEED breaks.
Grunty boi meme: exists  Grunty boi: HE HE IT IS I! GRUN TA BOI
Have a wonderful break. Till meet video, take care
To announce your return it should be thru a new poketalk video
That sponsor makes me uncomfortable. Why would you put shampoo on that hat?!
I hope you have a good break Mikey :) I’ll be waiting when you come back!
Finally more memes
13:41 he kind of looks like dumbo lol
Is it concerning that during the shower scene, I was focused on how good the tiles look?
Take a break! We don't need your vids (though we want them.) I hope you feel better.
Hi Mikey, watched to the end, I think that you should just upload when you want to, I’m sure your fans will understand and I’m sure you do need a break.
You decide it enjoy your break
Burn out happens and it’s definitely a real thing and with a bit of research I noticed that the videos now compared to 8 months ago now there are way more Pokémon meme reviews and reactions when back then the video were a lot more creative and seemed more interesting to make we all run out of ideas and have big things happen in our lives like your move so you can take a break whenever you like because if we’re true fans we would care about you more then seeing a video every week
Take your break, and take care of yourself. We can always enjoy your older content again.
Take care of yourself Mikey. A burn out can destroy more than you'll realize. I love your content and I'll rather watch everything again than seeing you unhappy. You rock dude, make the best of this situation!
well enjoy your break!  I'm only a little worried (steven universe went on hiatus for like 1 or 2 years and Do it, gurl has been on hiatus for like 7 years 😭) but I'll be fine.  I'm happy you've posted this long! I look forward to your triumphant return! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
5:22 ayo??? 😳
The ending of this video is where boys became men.
Have Grundy boy play Pokemon rocket vershon
we understand and will wait... come back soon and with pokemon talk or i will burn grunty boi
now we have a more time to do more art!
If Magiraffe has healing spit, I would be unable to not name it Steven.
Wonderful video as always, LOVE everyone’s interpretations of your creative Pokemon designs! And gone through by an amazing host no less :D  Hope your sabbatical is what you need and that you come back stronger than ever, we love you Mikey!
I think that was me who said it looked like orcane!
6:25 why is grunty boy putting shampoo on his head
I finally make it in one of Mikeys videos with a submission and its his last for the foreseeable future? I don't know if I should cheer or cry.
After a tragic death on June 30th, I may have know to name Lechonk to honor him
To me trainin looked like a tall mytie ninja in the first one
I totally understand you, Mikey. Enjoy your break! Hopefully you'll come back in a better mood and maybe you'll even bring Pokémon Talk back!
You always have our support we love your content so if you need a break why would we be mad, your great content is only great if you enjoy it. Keep your head up and take your much needed time off.
Sorry, did you say, "the latest episode of...I HIT MY EYE?"
enjoy your break mikey!  eventually when you return, you could make a video like "what happens inside of ancient pokeballs" since they arent as modern and scientifically advanced as the ones we use nowadays
Everyone who has been watching this guy for a while and then he goes away for a while and then you are bored cause he is the only thing you watch
1:57 HEY you mean 50% accurate? 😏
ORCANO That would be a could name
6:25 are we just not going to mention how he’s putting shampoo, onto his hat?
Have fun on the vacation much love. I can assure you as a subscriber for nearly 6 years we will of course miss you but we are glad that you are being honest and that you are doing what you want
Naming my lechonk techno in my nuzlocke because techno never dies.  Rip technoblade
Grunty boy:-wait you have a new bathroom right? Me:-wait no..no..NO!!!NO!!!NO!!!!
Mikey you are my favourite person on earth. your feeling burnt out, you could take a break for half a year and im pretty sure as a collective we wouldnt mind because if there is one thing that we can always count on its that your reliable take as long a break as you need and dont feel it necessary to justify yourself we love you have a great sabbatical hope you feel better see ya when i see ya😁
have a reat time on your Vacation i wish the best
Grunty boy's hat is born with him
The real reason Mikey is taking a break is that he need to figure out how to evolve Galarian Yamask lol.  In all honesty, I get taking a break from burnout, I do that all the time, so hope you enjoy your break, and remember, gotta catch ‘em allllllllllllllllll
I have bred a Rock Head Aron with Head Smash for a playthrough before and it was very fun. (I think for ORAS?)
Great video Mikey, I understand you getting burnt out I would rather wait and have amazing videos and have a happy Mikey than mediocre and a sad Mikey.
Burnout is a killer, Mikey. Take as long as you need for your break. We'll be here when you decide to come back, whenever that is.
Dude, enjoy your break, you deserve it. Love your vids.
1:58 But that makes it 50% accurate so…
I think it is a good idea for yourself to take a break and I am happy to hear you feel (hopefully) comfortable and in a place to be able to take a break. I also think it is a good idea to take it now, as I suspect you are very excited for the Gen 9 games and you will probably WANT to make video's (where you yourself can be proud and happy with). I'm very excited to see what the future will bring for your channel(s). And like you said, with all those FULL playthrough video's, that is a lot of work for you. But the other side of the coin, it is a LOT of rewatchablility, so I'm sure I'll be fed enough for the next month(s). Have a nice Summer!
Incineroar would be a top 3 starter if he was down on all fours
God bless Dr Squatch for giving us all these thirst traps
Mikey is the biggest man out of all of us
A break is a great idea, And here is an idea I had maybe a playthrough of a pokemon fangame on the plays channel would be a refreshing expiriance. There are even some great (and finished) new ones, like Infinity or Bushido
The galarian variant of mikey protect their eyes with their gamer goggles
I’m glad Mikey is taking a break he deserves it. But the serious monologue with the disco music in the back is hilarious!!
Take all the time you need Mikey! You deserve it buddy! You’re one of my Pokémon idols and I’m shiny hunting Natu via Masuda Method and I’m gonna name my shiny Natu after you Mikey! You deserve the break Mikey! You deserve it!
Have a good break man. See you when you get back
Rip his eye
What I know is that cockatrice is a chicken head with it body but the tail is a snake head as the main body the chicken is just a disguised
Take as long as you need. We understand why you need to, we really don’t want you to get burned out. But yeah man take as much time as you need we will understand.
6:16 We must stay focused brothers we must stay focused
My first random swsh  shiny  was in 2020 and is was purloin
I hope you have a good break mikey
the light it is closing
9:16 the gen starter is grass dragon....
Mikey deserves this. We should all just thank him for what he had done.
Always enjoy waking up to new meme reviews :) have a lovley vacation king💙
NOOOOOO!!! DOES THIS MEAN NO MORE ASPITIPIAY?
well, take your time.
"ask Peter pie"
Man you deserve that break man. I hope you come back soon because I and many others like your content, but take your time to get well.🙃
Go take your vacation Mikey, take many naps and have a good month/month and a half.
Honestly why not try pokemon tabletops United 😊 its pokemon dnd and it's great.  Enjoy your break mikey. No matter your decision we will always be thankful for the smiles you gave us
I LIVE RIGHT BY SHINY SUBWAY
All fun videos are helping me cope with the horrible death of technoblade Thank you so much
Mikey remember you will always be loved here
Mytey:"You cant defeat me" Castform:"Oh i know.but he can" Mikeymons
enjoy the break i look forward to more pokemon content you are the best  poketuber i watch and until next time got the catch them all
Technically Kukui is a teacher in the anime.
Look after yourself, we will be here when you get back.
14:56 OK here me out we call it orcast and give it an anchor
As sad as I am, you work so hard and you deserve this.
Take some time, make some time just for you in every week :)  videos are allways funny :3
If you need time away, go for it. I’d rather not see any videos for a couple months than have one of the few PokéTubers I watch quit.  If you are willing to take suggestions: Look into expanding your collaboration circle. Don’t get me wrong PM7 and Purplecliff are great and it’s always a blast with them but it would be nice to see you working with others as well
dear michael hope you get better and come back again. i'm going to miss your videos. greetings and big fan from denmark
of course mickey i will always respect your wishes have a nice break!!
Love ya Mikey we'll miss you on this how ever long hiatus
Take as long of a break as you need daddy
I...we did not need another montage XD
Love the Pokemon designs. Enjoy your break, we'll be here when you get back. Even if it's post Scarlet/Violet.
You're my favourite Pokémon YouTuber, Mikey, I enjoy your videos a lot and re-watching some of them sometimes I love your content and I think you absolutely deserve a few free months, you're a human like we all are first of all We'll be waiting for your comeback patiently, have a nice break!
Evoulution for tranin: basketbrawl
Quick question how do you normally bathe?  I was taught to soap up a rag and then bathe with that. Do people normally just bathe with the bar of soap.
It's Aspitapiay on my birthday 🎉
Check the subtitles also have a nice break
NOOOOOOOOO I MISSED MY OPPERTUNITY TO BE ON POKEMON MEME REVIEW man
In sword and shield my third encounter was a shiny zigzagoon
Is it a bad thing I know what the sponsor is gonna be when grungy boi says “IT IS I, grunty boi”
6:15  MandJTV when my parents walk in.
noooooo
Thx for being you mikey. You never fail to make me smile.
I want to say, I love your content. You are my 2nd favorite Youtuber, and my favorite Poketuber. I hope you enjoy the vacation. You deserve it.
The fact that Grunty Boi wore his hat in the shower AND added hair products to it is hilarious.
i hope you feel better
you deserve this break Mikey enjoy it
Take as long as you need, Mikey. Burnout is something all of us have probably faced, and it’s an understandable reason to take a break. We can wait as long as you need, because this is important to take, plus, we can rewatch your other content. So have an incredibly nice break, my man!
We understand but miss you
Take all the time you need Mikey.  We'll be here when you get back.  😊
MandJTV normally: 2:40  MandJTV when your parents walk in: 6:20
You deserve a break man. We all love your videos, but we love you more. We want you to be mentally and physically healthy, and we'll be here if and when you're ready to come back
Ps sorry 😂😂😂
Well your mum walked on you watching that LOL
I hope you have a relaxing break you totally deserve it! Don’t feel pressured or anything to get back on the grind though, you can rest for as long as you need!
Sadness
Or-can-na
Fun fact I found a random shiny stunky in legends arkoos
My Mom walked in my room when the grunty boy shower montage was going
Orcana
Not gonna lie, I swooned a bit when grunty boy winked at the camera.  There's just something about a confident bad boy😳....that smells good! Thanks to the sponsor of today's video, Dr. Squatch.
While he is introducing what the seiries is rapid blinking begins XD
That's fair Mikey take as long as you want
I am not telling you to change completely but maybe try a different game like Zelda or do what ever the heck you want
Maybe You could bring Pokémon talk back since it’s been a few years so it might be fun again. Don’t blame you if you dont
Have fun with your well deserved break Mikey!! I’ll miss you while you’re gone but I’m so glad you’re putting yourself first and figuring things out
Enjoy your sabbatical Mikey! Your content will be missed but it is wonderful to hear you can just put the channel on hold to just focus on yourself and other things! So like I said, enjoy, we will all be here when you are regenerated and ready to be back ^^
Someone make a master playlist of the best videos to learn the lore of the channel so everyone can be fully caught up over the next month when we need Mikey content
Have a good break Mikey, you deserve it man.
Take the time you need. And think about possibly dropping your deadlines for videos if that's a problem. We will be here when you get back. Enjoy the much deserved break Mikey.
You are me new saturday morning cartoons. I hope you have a nice sabbatical
Have a goof break :)
I'm glad you're taking a break, Mikey. You have gone longer without a significant break than most YouTubers I can think of.
4:00 If you don’t understand, if Spoink stops bouncing, he dies
i need that drippy merch
As wolfyvgc once said if you force yourself to do something you like you may stop liking it
i dont like mitey very much… but tbf thats probably because he is t posing
I was having a bad day until I learned that Mikey notices that GruntyBoy is more Confident and smells great.
I don't know if this helps your plans for the future, or if this was caused by your own frustrations, but my only complaint with your PLA playthrough was HOW FAST you went through it. You went through the whole game and post-game in like...four or five videos. I feel like you could have easily doubled that and not have had to come up with additional video ideas for a bit longer. So...maybe something to consider with future playthroughs?
It must be nice to be able to take a 2 month vacation because you feel burned out. That is a weak excuse dude. If you’re done be done and get a real job. Pull up your boot straps and figure it out
Y’all should watch Moxie2Ds video remaking Mikey’s Pokémon
Take however long you need man, we’ll be patient
another one
enjoy the break you deserve it
We love you Mikey
I dont really like lechonk that much, but I do like smoliv a, lot
Do not get me wrong I love your content but if you feel burnt out maybe you want to delay continuing until the new games are out just to cool down again or something
Enjoy your break, Mikey! I have also felt the effects of burnout on several occasions, so i fully understand the need to do so. Dont worry: i and many others will still be there when you come back. All the best to you!
If you need a break then take a break.
My friend group made a pledge to catch a lechonk for our team and name it Technoblade in honor of the pvp god.
_😳_
Could someone make the frogs to the pillar men poses from JoJo?
Lechonks German Name is Ferkuli. A mixture between "Ferkel" (Piglet) and "kulinarisch" (culinary). Very underwhelming unfortunately.
Petition for Mickey to play Undertale (he mentioned this in the among us meme review but he didn’t play it) Edit: the creator or Undertale, Toby Fox, composed the battle tower music for gen 8
Enjoy your break
I have an important question so me and my friend were making teams sky teams and he kept trying to use a tyrantrum claiming it is the  ancestors of birds because dinosaurs are the ancestors  of modern day birds.  I just need to know which one of us is in the right can't I use it or not. You reply to the comment as they only away hes going to accept the answer.
It just occurred to me that with the theme of "Past & Future" being the focus for the new legends... Could we get "Present" as a focus later on to compliment the initial 2 and make it a trio?
I'm happy for you to take a break I'm happy for all content creators to take a break as long as they let their viewers know also once you're ready come back and once you feel better could you give like a guess or something to when you come back if you can or feel like it you make amazing videos and I enjoy your content have a great break! (Take as long as you need 👍👍)
Don't worry Mikey take the time you need we love you!
It’s all good my guy I understand enjoy the break
orcane = orchaic?
You are a great poktuber and deserve such a break. Also love your outfit it reminds of the times where u were the hottest youtuber XD.
You even spent a tremendous amount of effort explaining why you need a break lol. We all recognize you work extremely hard and are passionate about all your content. You deserve the break, and thanks for all you do!
I got a shiny ziggzagoon in the first five seconds
Yo lechonk evos name better be i like themm lechonky and its a thiiiiiiiiccccccc boi
Mikey you deserve a break for all great content you have provided us with and i am sticking with your channel. Your channel is one of the main reason why I got so much into Pokemon and if you are running out of ideas I have suggestion, You can expand your content beyond Pokemon. I mean being a poketuber does not mean that your channel should only have Pokemon content. You can also dwell into other great Franchise. It is just my suggestion. Besides you are already doing great here. Love you man
Understandable, hope you figure out what you want to do.
1:59 If its not 100%...
Glad you're taking a break. Its a really good time now before scarlet/violet release later this year. I look forward to when you start posting content again. Enjoy the unpacking experience and enjoy your much deserved break!
Imagine our situation if you actually quit.We love you Mikey
Enjoy the break, I shall await your return.
i feel like everyone should take a break once in a while and it is summer now and summer is vacation season so mabey you could take yourself a little summer vacation and mabey feel a little better while you do
Enjoy your break Mikey 😀
I salute you sir, have an restful and healthy break! You deserve to have as much fun with the content here as we do!
Moxie did some very cool drawings I think you should check it out.
6:17 that was one of the greatest things to happen on this channel. 😂 I love how he uses shampoo on his hat even though it’s not his hair.
You have a good break Mikey your fans will see you when you return.
You and Ace Trainer Liam need to rest.. that’s 2 videos today of burn out issues.. we’ll be here when you get back. Your work is highly appreciated but your mental health is worth more. We love you man so take your time and come back when you’re ready! 👊🏾
Take as much time as you need. Your content is better when you’re having a good time making it :)
Don't leave me. Just kidding you do you
We will miss you our emporror
Bro you take all the time you need. Love you bro and hope you find that spark. We'll still be here when you make your triumphant return.
You deserve a break. Your content is awesome even your old stuff so take a break whenever you want because your stuff is amazing.
You take all the time you need! You deserve a break! We will be here when you get back. Just take your time and recharge! We love you Mikey!
M&JTV is taking a summer break!
Enjoy your break, Mikey! Burnout is real and we totally understand.  We'll all patiently wait for your return. Take care! ❤️
Jschlatt: I'm gonna stop streaming for a.couple of years also f u  Mikey: DONT FREAK OUT... I'm stepping down for a month... also I luv u
o7
So glad you are like a normal human man. Your videos are great I was wondering how you were keeping up with everything. I just experienced a massive burnout myself I was an assistant manager at a fast food place and doing full time college. I get that feeling, I hope you find your creative juices. I'm in the same state right now trying to boost myself back up after working myself to death.
Today I got a shiny in the fire gym challenge in sword
Its your choice mikey and im happy you made a choice good for you
I hope you enjoy your time off cause I understand how difficult it is to do something you like when you are burnt out.
Hope you enjoy your break and get some rest!
Orcant Can it be calede
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Mikey it’s fine take all the time you need to relax and plan everything you need to do
Bye Mickey, good luck, May Arkoos bless you
As with any job (and that’s what this is even if you enjoy doing it), you get vacation time. Enjoy your break. We’ll miss you, good sir.
i like you mikey you have good content in my opinion maybe you can do roblox like purplecliffe
You are my favorite poketuber and i will miss your videos! Have a great rest and cant wait for you to come back!!!
Ok well bye Michael take as long as you want love you content bro
The towel was on grungy boys neck, not his hips 😳
Mikey, I love your content, and you deserve the much needed rest from all the work you have put into your two channels.
Orcamer since is slams your opponents into to the ground
Incineroar on 4 legs is my nightmare.
It keeps happening all the best youtubers for me personally. I watch Mikey, tim hansen, krazyrabb1t, jacksepticeye, markiplier, Dante ravioli, dead meat and more obviously and it seems like all the best youtubers get burnt out and eventually leave. Just hope Mike doesn't. We all love you enjoy the break
Take a good rest Michael
Hopefully you will enjoy your break and get refreshed. Take as much time as you need.
Hey Mikey, I doubt that you will see this amongst the sea of other comments but I’m really happy that you are taking a break to take care of yourself. Your content has been helping me through my own mental health challenges for almost 4 years now, and as a student in grade school I can totally attest to similar struggles with burnout after long stretches of work. The work that you once loved turns into a chore that you find yourself avoiding. Recognizing burnout before it tarnishes the most brilliant parts of your life is a hard thing to do, and I am proud of you for stepping down from the hamster wheel to take a breather. Enjoy your sabbatical Mikey-  you have taken care of so many of us for so many years, and we could not be happier that you are taking care of yourself :)
I loved this video.
I’ve gotten two rain in the world Shinies on accident
I'm so happy that Mikey saw my awful Lechonk evolution! 😁  I really hope he gets some good rest during his break
I joy your break you deserve you
1:58 so it’s 50% accurate
Enjoy the sabbatical Mikey! We'll be here when you get back.
GBs voice getting higher and higher canonically makes the most sense in any Pokémon series. I said what I said.
Quad chesnaut looks so cursed
Mikey, I just want to say that as a fan of you channel from early on in the pandemic and that you definitely helped me get through this, I am glad that you are taking a break so that you can make better videos. Have a great break and take all the time you need. I will be watching my home page for a video of yours!
If he thought the drawings were good he should see moxie2d's drawings
6:54 wait....the professors aren't named after trees anymore 😳
There’s no shame in taking a rest. For all the content you have been creating, it’s a well deserved. Go enjoy yourself and making your house a home.  Many blessings! 🫶
Copmaton looks like a copper golem from minecraft
I understand needing the break, gives you time to relax and get stuff fixed up, plus who knows what info will come out for pokemon scarlet and violet during the break or things will come up to do, enjoy your break michael and relax.
Ooooo I'm as stupid as you that's to bad I guess I can't get it:(
We will miss you! But I hope you have fun!!
Those drawings of your fan made pokemon look fantastic! Makes me wish a lot of them were really going to be in the main games.  Enjoy your break, you've definitely earned it! Get some rest and catch up on everything you need to. I look forward to your return!
All the best!
Aw you can't take a break as long as you want: (EXCEPT MORE THEN 2 YEARS*cursed gun emoji*
Hey Mikey! Tomorrow is my birthday, so when I heard you'll be taking a break from YouTube, I was like 'WHY?' but everyone needs a little break from time to time.  I have never experienced total burnout before, because once I got to that point, I realised it wasn't right. I will definitely re-watch Pokemon talk for my birthday! PS. I hope you read the team Sky rap I commented on your platinum team Sky video. Until next time, gotta catch em all!
I used that Dr Squatch code and it took off $46!!
Just wanted to say this year I'm focused on my studies more than any other year, and my 4 (only) friends are staying in hostel so I barely get to talk to them. YouTube vids are the only thing keeping me entertained so guess I'll have to do something else. You deserve a break though so enjoy it
Someone get this man a break
Yo
Did anyone notice that Grunty Boy is putting soap on is cap? 06:23
self care is important, so take care on your break.
Everyone is talking about mikey taking a rest while me over here looking for a comment about G.B shower moment liked he put shampoo on his hat and winked at us
Damn that advert
Well, Intelion and Chesnaught we're bipedal from their first stage so I find them less disappointing
maybe lechonk evolves in tuaros
Imagine if during his break he comes up with ideas for Pokémon Talk
the art was amazing as and so are the videos(ill try to remake yours myself too) and u deserve a break have fun we can wait we have a lot to rewatch until then 😁😁
Yo do you bro. Take whatever time you need, the real fans will be here to welcome you whenever you come back. Have fun and relax (after finishing whatever is needed for the move of course)
Totally understand man u just enjoy ur break
I understand the burnout, but will it be a Pokémon talk long burnout??? And will Pokémon talk ever come back? Not to put pressure on you, sorry
Take care
The intro is why mikey needs the gamer goggles
so the doctor Squatch promos are just a way for mikey to do a bathroom reveal.
Good luck and enjoy yourself with your sabbatical Mikey. These kinds of breaks are important, especially in a creative field of work. So take as long as you need to recharge, plus the more creatively charged you are the more it will reflect in your content. So really it's a win for everyone. Anyways have a good break and we'll see you when you're ready.
I'm currently writing a massively long story series, so I know all too well how it feels to be burned out and want to take a breather every now and then. You absolutely should take some time off, because I feel it will benefit both you and us fans in the long run, and result in better content quality. So enjoy your break; you deserve it.
Am I the only one who finds Lechonk's name a little lame? ^^' I prefer the design to the name XD
You don't have to explain yourself to us. Everyone needs a break to focus on themselves. Enjoy the break, we will be here when you decide to come back. Until next time.
I have been enjoying your videos for quite some time. I hope that you enjoy your time to relax and unwind, as well as continue to give us great content.
We understand and patiently wait for you=) Have a good vacation, it is important to have time for yourself=3 Grunty Boi, you also have a great time=3
It's not baturty IT baturdty
Nooooo a mont no fun
Take your break man. You deserve it. Burnout sucks for sure.
It still seems like they aren't going to be the professors. They fit better as the evil team leaders. Though I suppose they could be both and just make it a plot twist when they reveal they are the evil team leaders too
It's important to take care of yourself, I'll be waiting for you to get back
2:00 50% accurate you mean
I wish you the best of luck on your sabbatical! We will miss you but wish you the best!
You deserve a break you make incredible content so stepping back is understandable. See you when you get back
What did he do to his eye???
I predict lechonk will evolve into bigpig
Mikey we all love you and whether you take a month or two months we will always come and watch ur vids. We have many great vids that we can rewatch and we still have Jack and John so we will be okay.
Take a break you deserve it
Noooooooooooooooooooooo
01:47 click here to start the video
I love the fact that Grunty Boy wears his hat in the shower.
What does this Morse code mean leave reply to answer .... .-.. .-.. -.-- . .- ....
Honestly, I don't get the Lechonk love. Sure the name is kinda funny, but I've never found pigs to be cute, so I just think it looks dumb.
Happy Vacation! You earned it! Hope to see you, grunty boi and all of the lovely characters you created after some time again.
Grunty Boy Used: Dr.Squatch Shampoo  It's not very effective against the opponent, Hat
Mikey, you are awesome. Your videos are so much fun and I always look forward to them. That being said please take as much time as possible for yourself.  We will be here when you are ready. Take care.
I'm convinced that the hat is attached to grunty boi's head
Oh wow I never thought that the proffesors names were based off of trees
Hey man, thanks for all the content you made, and all the times you made me laugh, enjoy your well deserved break
MIKEY!!! i would just love to sit down with you and help you come up with ideas. ):
Everyone needs a break, ESPECIALLY content creators. Take a rest, recharge yourself, and come back when you feel ready to come back here. Enjoy your time off, Mikey!
Aspitpiay
One was from patterz
Rip technoblade 👑🐽
The fan art of Mikey’s mons is amazing!
I hate when people copy memes
* sad noises that Mikey didn't see my drawing of all 18 of his pokémon * I posted it the day after his video went up and it didn't get upvoted enough ta be seen in the top posts
Have fun!
Enjoy your time off Mikey you deserve it I have been a fan since 2014 and I love all the videos you put out so take as long as you need and see you when you are ready
i feel so happy for you. take as long as you need on this break
Those recreations of Mikey’s Pokémon were amazing and take as much time as you need Mikey. I’ve gotten burnt out on things to the point where i’ve never came back to them and it sucks.
Enjoy the break!
Take your time mickey, rest all what you need, we are gonna be here waiting for you no matter how much time pases, the important is your own health bro
I understand and wish you a good break 😊
New Orcane name idea     Crueca
Moxie 2D made a vídeo drawing your pokémons please react
Make sure to post grunty boi shower montage two to his channel
Are you going to keep posting meme review?
So I’m gonna get a galarian shiny runerigus Well not a shiny galar- just a regular runerigus -Mikey 2022
16:15 watching this while playing alpha sapphire fighting a team aqua grunt was hilarious for me. Hearing the dramatic battle music as (team sky) Mikey shouted at grunty boi made me laugh so much.
Maybe do some reviews on some rum hacks
Mikey take as long as a break as you need and. Just remember that we as your audience will always support 2000%.
I’m thinking that for dartoad he could have an exclusive move called poison frog or something like that and it’s effects varies on the collor, and the Pokédex entry could be like random facts about the Pokémon and at the end it says “his venom is so strong it makes u feel burned” for the red one, “his venom is so strong it makes you feel paralyzed” for the yellow one and “his venom is so strong it makes u feel frostbite and frozen” for the blue one and the effect of his exclusive move matches his Pokédex entry
When you decide to come back, I’d really like to see more Pokémon Types, then vs. now videos. I really like those, and I think they’re really interesting.
Take a break, get some time to yourself. I think we all need a little vacation time
Self care is very important get that rest
Mikey, you don't owe us any explanation, you just need vacations, like any worker in planet earth, so take as long as you need, you won't lose views, you won't lose subscribers and you'll make your subscribers more exited for your return.  Like I said before, take care of yourself and return more motivated 👍
Whatever you need I along with the rest of your fans will support you we all love your videos and at least I understand what it does to someone that does what you do I was a huge fan of Matthew Santoro and he had taken a year off and came back better than before it that's what you need then I fully support you
A platypus Pokemon? But why? They don’t do much, you know.
another name for your oracle could be orchaos :)
I’ve been watching your videos for years and I never understood how you posted weekly so take all the time you need
Glad you have the awareness to take a break before you hit a wall. Please take as long as you need Mikey- we will all be here and supportive whenever you return. ❤
Doomoose’s design looks so menacing!
Play Kirby and the Forgotten land when you come back
Grunty Boi is the best thing to happen to this channel, it makes ads so much funnier! I love the banter between you two! 😂🤣
Stay safe on your break we will miss you
I think I speak for everyone when I say the last thing we want is for you to disappear forever so if you need time off. Take it and please come back feeling rested and better
I found the new Grunty Boy montage funny. 😆 I hope you enjoy your break Mikey!
Breaks are important!!! Burnout is rough, so take as long as you need! ♡ I hope you have a restful sabbatical, and it's everything you want it to be ♡ Take care, and see you later in a future video :D
Taking time off to plan, eh? Welllll there is an idea I've been mulling over a long time.   So you have videos on "what if all rivals were gym leaders", "what if all gym leaders were the 8th gym", "what if all professors were gym leaders", so on and so forth. One video I always wanted to see you do was "what if all gym leaders weren't gym leaders". The reverse of "what if all rivals were gym leaders". Basically, what would these teams be, if they weren't restricted to single typings. We know all the gym leaders can fly and surf, even if their teams dont have those moves. They have confirmed that in a handful of different games. So, based on personality and maybe some info from other sources (like how in the anime Brock uses vulpix and Misty uses Togepi), what would the gym leaders teams look like if they weren't monotype?
Mikey check out moxie 2d they reacted to your video, did a try not to laugh challenge, and drew your Pokémon all on one go
Take all the time you need, we are willing to wait.   After the break: ULTRA POKÉMON MEME REVIEW  Don't work yourself up that we will be impatient. We love your content, and we don't want you to get to the point you will be off yt for good. Take a break, and have a good time.
What a great sponsorship to take a break after lol
Michael Its completely fine that you take a break  The only thing i ask for is updates if possible  Mainly so We dont forget you But you should take a well deserved break
Am I the only one that claps along with Pokémon *clap clap* meme review
King you deserve this take a break
Mikey is the most nonchalantly bisexual youtuber I've ever watched, second only to Arin Hanson.
F in the chat for micheal
Guaranteed when Mikey returns there will be return of the king memes
You should try to play more fan made Pokémon games, even if offscreen they're a really good way to diverge from the normal pokemon games
Enjoy your break Mikey! Burnout sucks, so take as much time as you need! See you whenever you get back :)
You deserve all of the time and rest.
14:53 Orchaos
It's ok Mikey you deserve to take a break I love ur content and I hope you get the rest you need thanks again
I like that goat Pokemon there from your art, I'm working on a comic called "The isles of Terrakeia."
Go for 10 million subs here. Just ask matpat and steph from game theory they do consulting and optimization help
Grunty boi when he said Mikey had a new shower I was like WAIT. OH NOOO HE’S HOT…AGAIN!  Side note: sorry to see you go for a bit but everyone needs to take a break sometimes and you will always be my favorite poke-tuber and regional team leader.
The only problem with that pig chart is that Munna is a tapir, not a pig.  It'd be closer to Drowzee on the evolutionary chart than the pigs...and probably closer to Ponyta and Rhyhorn, too...
Enjoy your break. Everyone needs one now and again. Especially to get the creative juices running again
Your aloud to take a break
He does know that he made 2 human looking pokemon
take care man
Flopflap reminds me of Terriemon
i imagine seeing a meme where lechonks face is sticked on to lebron james face and his playing basket ball
“They taunt us with what could have been” intileon has no gun, incineror loses his ticket to smash bros, and embor looks even worse.
I am really glad that you announced this and dont just disappear.
I saw the French Gliscore meme a while ago. It's my favourite.
HIANUS
Take a month off if you want, even a year off if you truly need it, thanks for telling us :)
Both Orcanes are resemble the Ahklut
Mikey needs a break to find more members for team sky
Lechonk is the best Wooloo isn't even comparable
Take your time Mikey everybody needs a break every now and then
Am I the heretic in saying that evolving runerigus isn't that bad? Just take hit from a Pokémon past the halfway point and your fine! That's how it evolved in my game!
Just don't miss a monthly meme review and I am happy to wait till September for regular content
0:45 “stupid like I am” Flashbacks to Mikey John and jack Magneton Pokédex entry 2:00 if it’s not 100% it’s 50% so the banner is 50% accurate 10:38 blue 12:40 Cosmoth is just Icarus but pokemon 13:15 isn’t that basically Absol’s? I love it but I think it’s similar to Absols Pokédex
In the meme review there where like four memes
You should consider going back to episodic let's play style content, but on the plays channel. Some creators are going back to it after being burned out by the current algorithm and it hasn't had any negative impact on their channels!
Take a good long break Mikey, you earned it. Also seeing your reactions to everyone's fanart of your own pokemon was my favorite part of this video! People are so dang talented, I'm jealous!
Take that break, burn out is the worst and I’m glad you could catch it before it ruined Pokémon or YouTube for you forever
Have fun Mikey! 😁
Hey man, if a sabbatical is what can not only make you feel better but also increases your content with future videos, then I'm all for it dude
I hope this rest its for the best PD: i hope to see team sky some day again i actually love those videos
Everyone needs a break sometimes. It's ok. I hope you get the rest you need💕
Jalamodo is basically Scovile from Pokémon Xenoverse
0:02 been there
We fully understand and respect that you need a break. Live your life mikey!
Hey it's ok, take the break and enjoy it, you have more than enough content to keep us busy while you take that vacation, so please don't stress out about us and youtube and have fun.
You should watch Moxies video when he redrew your Pokémon
🙅: *possible leaks, trailers and teasers for Scarlet and Violett* 😊👉: *RWBY Volume 9 news (early 2023), 4 minute sneak peak and RWBY/Justice League crossover movie announcement*
It just occurred to me what Sword and Shield did. When Magnolia passed on the torch to Sonia, it was a subtle nod of moving on from an old naming scheme to allow for more freedom in Professor naming, and they even doubled down via when Hop decides to also pursue Pokemon Education as a career path.
I get it, you had to move away from Jack lol
2:00 You mean 50%?
You deserve to have time off it is your life is golden and I say have a fun and great Vacation. See yah later. Always love your content is always gold.
Hope you have a good vacation
Good on you for taking a break Mikey, and great content btw.
He's leaving us
if we have any more episodes with this naming convention, this series will be renamed LECHONK!
I never thought I said this but..  did I just get turned on by grunty boi?
You can take as many breaks for as long as you want.
Pretty cool to see different possibly regional variants of your Pokémon in meme review! I hope you know that your fan base will always stand by you and so take as much time as you need, it will be a shame to not see an MandJTV video each week because I love them but you need this and I get that, we’ll be waiting for when your ready and take your time:)
Take as long as you need Mikey! I hope your reevaluation goes well!
Nooooooooooooooo
That Grunty Boy promo hit different SHEEEAH
Pokèmon
Will be here once you return Take care!
In this episode, Mikey somehow manages to hurt his eyes with a soft fabric hoodie.
Thats okay mikey, take a break you deserve it. just make sure grunty boy not stealing your channel😂
12:40 THE ABSOLUTE RADIANCE
I'm actually happy with this, as I'm in the middle of a move, as I'm moving into my new house in a month, and this way I don't have to worry missing out.
Mikey ! Take all the time you need, you’ll have our support. We love you and most of us understand. Find that fire again, love what you do again, pal. Your videos have been a blessing to me in a time when I needed them so I’ll be here when ya get back homie ❤️✌️➕
Are you still going to be on the PM7 channel and stuff like that?
Gg, I felt like I would make it with my Trainin evolution and 3 likes lol 😅
1st Get your well deserved rest. 2nd When you back please finish your Series ''Pokemon Then Vs Now''
Hello I have a question  Which video of Mikey’s has the original dr squat h sponsorship.  I want to know for, personal reasons…
dammit now Poketips Mike and Michael are not gonna upload
I'm so glad you're taking this break for yourself. I hope that it helps you mentally, and I wish you the best. 😄
I am hoping that the shiny for Lechonk is like a pink pig. Also if I had a Lechonk I would name it Waddles as a reference to Gravity Falls.
6:24 that hat must smell great
2:00 Nah that's a 50% accuracy
2:03 so 50% accurate?
Mikey why!!!!
Shoutout to the Best Poketuber for me, Michael,  Love you bro, You totally deserve A break
For Orcane it is water/dark. Maybe its commonly found at the dark depths of oceans. It could be called...Orcasm (Orca+Chasm).   ...        ...           ...      And yes this is a joke.
Thank you for all the content you posted. They are always a delight. Enjoy your well earned and deserved break.
Aaaaaaah! Oh ok take a nice break
Do what's best for you, we all support you and want what's best for you
:(
Hey I understand the break man but I will miss your content
You should have been a pie rat for the video.
It’s okay Mikey! Take your time and take breaks! Good luck!❤️❤️❤️
hey dude good take as much time off as you need good luck figuring out what you need too
Bro if you need a break everybody needs one and the people that are loyal to your channel will stay with you no matter what have fun don't do anything stupid😉
Well I’m sad that u won’t be uploading videos for a while but I understand. And I’ll be waiting for the YouTube notifications of ur next video! Love ur content Mikey!
Please take as long as you need. Everyone needs a break, to step back, to feel like what you're doing is actually fun. You're content is amazing, but I know it will be even better when YOU can express your excitement to the fullest.  Don't feel pressured to come back asap. We'll be waiting for you to be at tip top shape, even if its months from now. :)
i think you should go back to old content. Do a series like XD again. Fun lengthy lets plays are some of the best videos on this channel. But please dont make them like the legends arceus playthrough, because it just felt like nonsense.
yos
It's funny how some YouTubers think a month is a long break, while other YouTubers have a monthly upload schedule, while other YouTubers still upload less often than even that. Some people just have different paces I guess. I half expected Mikey to say this is his last upload of this year. That would be a break for me.
Take the time you need my guy. Burnout sucks and everyone needs a break. We'll see you in a month or so ^^
“Lechonk has one of, if not the best name for a Pokémon” may I introduce Overqwil
Plot twist: Grunty boi was wearing swim shorts in the shower
6:25 Anyone else notice he put shampoo on his hat?
LEEEEEECHONK
I’m happy you’re taking some time off. I love your videos a lot as well.
Loved the vid man. Everyone needs a break. Enjoy yourself and stay safe!
Hey Mikey, I haven’t been a long time viewer, I started watching about 2 months ago, and I have loved all of your videos I have seen. I have been watching all your videos and series since I began watching and it feels like you deserve a brake. Please take all the time you need and your mental health is way more important than putting out videos. Enjoy your time of my man
Everyone: Miley? Green Goblin: Mikey's on sabbatical!!!
Mikey, catch up with everything you need to and do it for however many months you need to.
I didn’t know with a shiny of corvisqire and I was playing shield and I saw a corvisqire and the sun made it look golden and I thought it was shiny😞
Lechonk is the new snom
Do you need the see Moxie2d drawing your Pokémon designs.  They are sick.  Have a fun vacation. TBH the most fun I have watching you is doing PM7 challenge content.  I’m not saying rip that off.  I’m just saying collabs and friend banter are fun.  Not every video on this channel has to be some new unique Pokémon idea.  There’s only so much Pokémon content you can do.  I don’t know if there’s enough content for it. But a bi weekly video podcast with PM7 and purplecliff would be fun.  Something casual where you talk Pokémon but also other things.  Kind of hell trash taste is a “anime” podcast.  It would be a lot of work but maybe that something new would be motivating
I think you really should take at least a month off from youtube, everyone deserves a break, or else our mental health will decrease to the point of causing physical harm. Whenever you decide you're ready to be back, we'll be here waiting for you. Enjoy your break! You deserve only the best!
Mikey you deserve the rest just know that I and your whole fan base will still watchtower your videos
I will nexttime🙂
Damn IT!! Mine didnt get in
The fact the man is , well, not satisfied by his own excellent content really shows his.....exhaustion ig. Take a break Mikey , love ya and your content, see ya!
Mikey says 33% the whole internet . If it not 100% its 50%
wish you a good breack and hoppe we will see you soon back ^^
You deserve it bro enjoy your vacation, but I hope you don't dissapier randomly just like Poketips did😞
Hi
Name it orrain
You deserve a break, Mikey. Take as long as you need. (Also I bet that I could eat pizza, my favorite food, three’s times a day for three months.)
I totally understand the burn out, but when you’re ready again, you could play other games that you like so that you won’t have to take another break
That's why you wear eye protection Mikey
Cool video and cya around mikey
I have seen nobody comment about this but at sometime in the past Mikey siad that the shower thing was supposed to be funny and not athirst trap but he has gone to far. and i hope he is better with his break after.
Nobody:  Grunty Boy: uses shampoo on hat
Mikey, u deserve a rest dont worry We will always follow u
5:22 is a thrist trap ... and 6:21
TAKE IT EAZY NO ONE SHOULD BE MAD
Yo man! Just enjoy your break. No pressure. We'll be back when you come back. Just make sure you're in the right headspace when you do come back.  Anyways, I'll just re-watch the metronome randomizer nuzlocke again with the dumb stupid seed.  Enjoy Mikey!
Take all the time you need
Grunty boi pouring the shampoo on his hat fuckin killed me
I'm the one who made that comment! This is the first time anything like this has happened to me. Also thank you for the explanation.
Rip technoblade
Dang it my thing wasn’t on there
enjoy the break you need it
take your sebatical prof.Mikey. team sky is here when you need us
In the name of Castform and Mytey, WHY?
It's ok Mikey I'm sure everyone understands why you'd be taking a break most likely this isn't the first time someones favorite YouTuber has gone in hiatus for one reason or another
Hey Mikey can you address technoblades death? I am down about him cause he died and was a legend ❤️
It's ok You take a break
Orcana, if it's more magically inclined.
grunty boi is a himbo and i don't know how i feel about that
you take however long a break you need Michael, we will always be here for you, eagerly awaiting your eventual return.
Perfection
Take as much time as you need dude
Get some rest man you deserve it.
I think grunty boy should upload videos while Mikey is off 😂
Enjoy your break! Stay safe Mikey!
Everybody needs to take a break have fun
Enjoy your break sooo much, thanks for always bringing a smile upon my face, take all the time that you need, we’ll be waiting!!
Man, the main channel is kinda turning into the pokemon talk situation, but I feel like you're taking a respectable break. Go enjoy yourself.
Remember in Pokemon R/B/Y when running shoes didn't exist at all?!
Normal people seeing cosmoth  Hollow knight fans seeing cosmoth
14:56 Orbane!
Take as much time as u need. We'll be right here waiting for u when u come back! Love you Mikey!!
I feel like if Mikey took a slower approach,but bigger ideas for content it would please him and his audience. I'll relate to how Alpha changed his content. He stopped being as consistent with videos,but his uploads all hit and were special in their own ways. Mikey could do the same. Maybe we won't see as much,but taking a quality over quantity approach could help this channel and his own burn out. This is just spitballing something I thought of. I dearly hope he can handle the burnout, since feeling like a chore to do your favorite things can be miserable. I hope this next month goes well!
Good you need a rest
bro i thought he was quitting when he said he was taking a break
All 1.81M of your subscribers fully understand. You have been a blessing to all of us with your consistency and passion. To be honest, I thought you was going to take a break a lot earlier but you still wanted to push videos just for the sheer love of the fans here. Please for the love of everything, take as much time as you need. We are not going anywhere and when you do come back, let's hit that 2 million mark. We care about overall health on this channel.
Have a great break
Why you have you break I will be rewatching Pokémon talk 😊
Hey man take a break we can rewatch the video's  all the amazing video's u make
Hey Mikey, hope you enjoy your time off. Hopefully you will find some inspiration for a style of content that feels right and exciting.
Enjoy your break! We appreciate all your hard work, but look after yourself ☺️ Notifications are on and we’ll be here when you get back 😁
Have a good break Mikey and if you need to take longer to produce better content I think majority of people would agree, and Have a good break and hope you get your creativity flowing again
OMG!!!!!BATHROOM REVEAL🙀🙀😜🤪😝🤪🤩🥳🤩🥸
Everyone needs a break.  We'll be here when you get back.
it's my birthday today 🎉
oh great here we go again,time to wait 6 months jk we have a reliable one
Thanks for the awesome video! Enjoy your sabbatical and we will be here ready when the next video drops. Take care man, you deserve the break
6:20 is the sequel that none of us expected but needed
Enjoy your break ,man. It's good for your mental health!!
It’s okay, Mikey, to take any type of break. Being burnt out is something that becomes a topic among YouTubers when they take a lengthy time. To be honest, if you like to take a break, take a break. Most fans (including me) will understand why you take a break.  Not really related to the topic but Twomad usually uploads a few times every month and his videos are popular and have great comedic value.  The thing is, once you take YouTube as your job and work, it gives you a feeling that you might disappoint your fans if you don’t upload when in fact, only most of your fans will not even mind you taking a break, and the chance of a fan asking where you have been is low. Granted that such a group of fans (i.e obsessed fans) don’t make up the majority.  Since Meme Review is not going to be here a few months, I may go *back* to the drawing board and start drawing Mitey with cuter mascots or probably your created Fakemon that surely become the favourite majority of your fanbase, and probably a lot of your fans will draw some as well. Good luck with the break; maybe in the next Meme Review, it’s going to be more exciting.  I hope you have a nice day!
Did you know lechonk is named after a Hispanic pig dish named lechon
He will return for scarlet and violet
I hope you enjoy your break, Michael
Mikey: 0 Mikeys hoodie: 1
You deserve a break man
He's pulling a MumboJumbo, enjoy your break bud.
👏👏POKEMON👏👏 MEME 👏👏REVEW
No problem, take all the time you need. Everyone need to take a break Everyone now and then
I comepletely understand you need a break - take all the time you need we will be here when you get back. On your business side you might want to consider a patreon it might help you not feel so pressured to take sponsorships.
My first random shiny from sword and shield was a shiny venapilld from the sky when I was doing Dragon types
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
10:49 ...I mean I'd argue that Psyduck/Golduck (especially Golduck) has platypus characteristics. The main reason Golduck's obviously my favorite.  I'd LOVE to have more platypus Pokémon tho. And more kiwis aside from Doduo. And a bumblebee.
Honestly I’m more into viveret the genet Pokémon.
Hey Michael, i hope you will be back on youtube after you're done with you're vacation. ^^
Mikey , it’s ok! If you need a break then take that break plus it’s your channels so if you need your break then we will wait for you!!
Take care of yourself and enjoy your rest.  I hope you will come back healthy and motivated soon, but not too soon for yourself.  Have a great summer and enjoy yourself.
WE SUPPORT YOUR DECISION MICHAEL❤️
I was actually watching this in the bathroom and seeing grunty boi use the dr.  squatch in The bathroom
Personally I actually think that lechonk is overrated
TOO MUCH PAIN
Better name(not) OrBane
Enjoy your break thanks for letting us know
You good mike do your thing.
Take care of yourself! No matter how long it takes. We’ll be around for you when/if you decide to come back.
LECHONK
Moxie2D made a whole video redoing his pokemon. They all turned out really good!
Yeah dude. Just chill til Scarlet/Violet. Nov 18th. There isnt anything more to really do til then. I guess you could react to the new directs and whatnot, but it isn't that big of a deal. It's just vacation time. A much needed reset button.
We all support you Mikey! Take as long as you need on your break. We're gonna be waiting for you for as long as you need.
See you next meme review
Hey Mikey, we are always proud of you! Breaks are amazing and very important. We will always be here when you come back and we will rewatch your videos!!
It's fine Mikey take a break for as long you want and we all support you😁
After the burnout make content that is not only pokemon. Do all sorts of things like other games, reaction videos( not to Pokemon)
You deserve a lot more rest take the rest big boiii
Take however a long break you need! You really deserve it, pal!
Hey, Mikey. First of all, thank you for having made such great videos for so many years consistently. They have been really entertaining and have been a positive thing to look forward to ever since I began watching them. Also, it is totally understandable for you to take a sabbatical. After graduating high school, I was burnt mentally, so I took a 7 year break before going to college. I recently graduated in May of this year with a degree in Game Design, but before I go out and pursue my dream career, I am taking a short sabbatical in order to keep my mental health in check. I appreciate you for taking the time to do this for yourself, and I will be looking forward to your return. 👍
I've watched a LOT of YouTubers; you definitely deserve a break dude. It'll be awesome when you come back.💖
I love you Mikey. Take your time and I be hare when you comeback.
have a great break
I love your video and you make people happy and laugh and they will subscribed to your channel because u are freaking awesome
you do you Mikey! everyone deserves a break! dont worry we will be here when you return! ☺ love ya and take care! 💚
I remember looking through the sub Reddit and seeing all the 'Ask me anything about ( Gen 9 Pokémon ) and edit your comment to make me look bad formats. The Fuecoco one got so heated...
No worries, Mikey. I know how you feel. I had to stop my vine compilations because of burnout, but at least (for the time being), people can enjoy my new music compilation series. Hopefully people will like it
Grunty boi’s hat needs conditioner too
Best of luck Mikey, you deserve this rest. Been an avid fan for 5 years and i love that you respect yourself and your content enough to do this
Don't worry about taking a break - we're all still going to be here when you get back :) Make sure to take care of yourself <3
Don't worry Mikey! It's okay to take a break, everyone needs one eventually. I hope you will feel much better after your break!
This comment exusts so more people can see this video
Hey Mikey don't worry take all the time you need we still love you and your content so take care of your self and take all the time u need and we'll see you soon
14:55 Mikey how about Orcatastrophe!
If the banner is not 100% accurate it's 50% accurate
Shower montage
Hugs Mikey!
Oh s#@t i cant live a month without grunty boy- I'm so saaaad
Hey Mikey take ur time off it is ok
I hope you enjoy your break Mikey
Mikey, you have given me so much support since I found your channel in like 2016. Take as much time as you need to rest and get your creative thoughts flowing again. As someone with severe motivation issues, burnout sucks. We all love you man, and I think everyone will be excited to see you make a return, when you're ready 🥰
I kind of disagree with the lechonk opinion, bidoof is still kind of popular as a meme pokemon because of design alone
Injoy your break micky
damn first one piece on month break now you what am I supposed to watch now, although you deserve it take as much time as you want
I hope you take a nice break Mike. See you when you come back!
Don’t be afraid to take a break because of burnout. love your content thank you.
10:23 if any if you are wondering that's from NCHproduction that gut who posted it didn't give any credit by the looks of it so there
ive been watching all your content to help comfort me since technoblades death. If you need to take break from making content for a while thats fine
Hope you enjoy your sabadeclce and look forward to seeing you again
As someone who writes for fun, yeah, I know how burnout feels.
Don't worry about taking a break, man. I'd rather have you take a break to come back with your awesome stuff later, rather than continuing your current schedule and leading you to decide you don't want to do this anymore.
I'll really miss the videos. But rest well and rest with peace of mind. We'll be awating your triunfant comeback!
We totally understand bro take the time u need  AHHHWUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU   1 love from Baltimore 💪🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💙
We all love LECHONK
THAT WINK BROKE ME
Enjoy your break man. Don't worry about it. Any content is always welcome
What if Grunty Boi takes over while Mikey is on break
Yay I was hoping you'd mention rivals of aether's Orcane!  My name suggestion is Warca (pronounced WOR-cuh)
15:45 well would you look at that.
WAIT THEYRE NOT NAMED AFTER TREES ANYMORE!?!?
MEMEMEMEMEMEMEMES
I'm not upset about your break but I am happy I have been overwhelmed by how much video's your posting and it's kind of concerning me of how you post so often
My first shiny that wasn’t in Pokémon GO was an Ursaring and it was in legends -arceus- Arkoos so I evolved it to an Ursaluna.
man i love watching your videos since 6 years !!! this is a news i wasnt expecting
Been waiting for Mikey to do another dr. Squatch promo to use the code, thanks Mikey
Did Jubie and Mike break up?
Take as long as you need Mikey, we hope the best for you.
Moxie 2d did it to
“You moved, right?”  He says while inside his new house
You deserve the break!
When I saw Lechonk I thought the name was dumb but I loved the design because as a kids my neighbors were farmers and the owned a black pot bellied pig that looked a lot like Lechonk so it’s pretty nostalgic for me
You doing so much hard work with your channels,now you can take your time and recharge,we will gonna be waiting for a new content from you, Mikey,we will always love you (sorry for my English)
Take all the time you need Mikey. You’ve got to take care of yourself and we will be here when you get back to it. 👍
"You moved" Oh no i know where this is going
6:17 grunty boy shower break 😂
7:32 made me laugh so hard I thought I was going to die
This is the guy that puts his thumbnails of him in a vest top tensing his muscles😂😂😂 what a goof
btw i think the scarlet box art legendary swelling up its throat joke is a monster hunter reference, specifically the great jagreas monster
Love your videos and you as an artist, and I can only speak for myself but I would rather you take it's break and comeback new and strong, than see another great YouTuber fall do to burnout.  Enjoy your vacation/break, can't wait till your next video
Well... I'm gonna watch PM7 and Purplecliffe until you come back!
If it's not 100% accurate it's 50% accurate 1:50
I'm sorry that you're feeling burned out man, hopefully the sabbatical can help those creative juices flow again and you figure out what you want to do.  Stay safe and take care!
Rest Well Mikey! Have Fun with your Break!
If you need a rest it's okay you work very hard and it's highly appreciated by everyone
The Fuecoco ricec cooker animation is by NCHProductions btw , just giving a heads up
I fond a shiny in sword and shield without shiny charm and forgot to save
i will miss you mandjtv
*SLAMS FIST ON TABLE* THIS IS THE FAN SERVICE WE WANTED!
Lechonque
Hey mikey you could make a superhero channel after your break 😉
mikey: "Thats only 33% acurate" everybody: *deep inhale*
That is super responsible of you Mikey. We will still be here when you get back.  I can only imagine how you feel as a much smaller creator I don’t like making scripts and I don’t like editing so I can only imagine how bad it is for you.  Make sure to take care of yourself we support you the whole way.
I've seen a shiny Walgreens here in Tucson.  It has an actually green sign.  Also, have a good break, can't wait for you to return!
Take some long good rest my dude. For how good your videos are, I would wait any duration to watch them. They wouldn't be the same if you weren't enjoying them, and were absent of the personality you usually portray on your YouTube channels.
Where's the MTV shirt?
Moore lechick
What if the professors don’t have tree names because they are the villains of the game.
16:40 seems a bit like crayon-eating titan if you ask me
Got.e. Hit ‘‘em all
It’s ok you really need and deserve a break
4:08 so relatable
You take that break and you enjoy it! We’ve got plenty of older videos to rewatch!
This video maked me feel better for a moment 😔
I hope you enjoy your break, Mikey.  Do what is best for you, we'll be here when you come back. Love you dude.
All of that artwork was amazing. It makes me want to see your original Pokemon spring to life in-game. Have yourself a good vacation, sir! See you in - perhaps - a month or so!
I hope you enjoy your break and I hope you know we will all support you with any decisions you feel is best
Have a fantaboulus break, and great video as always!    Enjoy your break to grunty boi :)
I totally agree, Smolive needs more love. On Doomoose, however, I don't have a problem with it's snoot so long as I can boop. It's the dex entry I'm iffy on, as it seems to overlap heavily with Absol.
Take all the time you need man. You’ve been at this for a long time
At 4:10 there are characters that some might consider hot and then just kabu, fire type gym leader.
Ordive
I'm glad you mentioned the script thing. I noticed it a while ago, and I've been worried about your burn out. I'm super happy for you that you're taking the time for yourself.
Mike just became Swedish!
Take a Break And I Hope Your Main Channel Reach 2 Million Your Gaming Channel 1 Million And Clips Channel 100 Thousand Subscribers
Have a great break you deserve it  (You up load once a month on gaming you don't need to upload more but it's not 2 weeks)  Also love your videos
mikey:something called burn out  me: i have gotten used to it I hope you enjoy your break  do it for as long as you like :)
Enjoy your break. You are doing fantastic and deserve it. 🥰
Yeah Mikey, everyone needs a break at some point, and it’s definitely a smart idea to take a break before burnout than during it
RIP Techno. He was a good man
Mikey, go ahead and take a break. You’ve been making content so frequently for so long that you deserve a break.
You take as long as you need Mikey. Between the two channels we have plenty to watch and enjoy, you deserve a break.
You take all the time you need, Mikey
enjoy ur break man! i think we all as fans can understand that you’ve been doing your best and we want to honor that. hopefully you’ll be back to show us the greatest scarlet and violet playthrough on youtube
Finally
If the banner isn’t 100% accurate it’s 50% accurate.
Take a well deserved break. I was in the same boat, worked 50 hours a week as a teacher for a year and a half and had to take an almost 4 month break before going back to teaching again. Once I got back into it I feel better about things and found a better place making more money working only 35 hours a week.  I hope to see your content soon. You have been a stable of my YouTube algorithm for the last 2 years. :)  Rest well and enjoy your time off to regroup.
I hope you enjoy your break. I get burnout it sucks and I’m glad that you are taking a break before it completely stops you. Good luck and I wish you the best. See you once you’re back and enjoy your break
Also argean bisharp. Argea is the name of my region. Its based on greece
o7
Have a nice break☺️I hope you do some fun stuff and feel happy and energized when you come back eventually
I hope you have fun at your vacation you deserve this brake
2:00 actually, it is 50% accurate
We're gonna miss you, Mikey! Take some time off, you deserve it! I know for sure we're gonna see you back in November!
Lechon is a Filipino food lechon lechonk
Phew... I thought you were gonna give up on YouTube for a sec...  No more Pokémon content for me I guess. Oh well. Guess it's time to continue me second rewatch on... All... Your videos... Ever
Fun fact about me: my first shiny ever was found in the same route that Michael found his shiny galaring yamask
We have that exact same pokemon towel at home.
It’s truly crazy how you have been keeping up videos so consistently, I agree that it would be best for a break.
Take that break man. You deserve it.
Better to have a break now rather than quit entirely later! Enjoy your rest!
Enjoy your well deserved break! You don’t need to put any pressure on yourself to come back as soon as possible. Hope you’re more excited about your creative content after you’ve taken some time to self care. We love you Mikey! ❤️
Mikey: So that all is about 33% Accurate. Me:If it’s not 100% accurate it’s 50% accurate. DID YOU FORGET
Flying then dark flying
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Bring back the old profile picture
One of my favourites are heragles and hargoyle
19:15  The text below "Dartoad" 🤣    okay but all jokes aside, it's fine if u take a break mikey we will always stick around. 👍
We went from eternal rivals to "hey dude"
6:28 i can see why global warming is not stopping, anyway im gonna go take a shower and bleach my eyes goodbye pokefans.
Mikey it’s good that ur having a break if ur too tired to continue.Hope u will be back soon!
Another tofuu
Ummm, I made my own pokemon region and over a hundred pokemon
If you ever want to post a video when on break grunty boi will always be there to get quick views and lots of likes
Anybody else early?
I got the same random wild shiny interesting
Me after he said that the professors are not named after trees anymore: there is a Sona tree
Wow!
6:17 Good Lord i was drinking water at the wrong time lmao
you should make a discord for us Mickey so then you can inform us on when videos come out and all stuff youtube important or just to enjoy time with fans
Take your time to recharge.
19:15 look at what Pokémon he is
I think mabye 20-30 days MandJTV be gone until the next video.
mikey it may only be 33 percent accurate but if its not 100 percent accurate its 50 percent accurate
First
It was so painful yet hilarious how Grunty Boi just poured shampoo directly on his hat
Enjoy your break it is well deserved. Take as long as you need bud
To male things simpler you could just post 2 videos on each channel per month and maybe more if u feel like it. This would take off the pressure of a short time limit whitch means you can put more effort and end up with a higher quality video, you can focus more on your personal life and you can still keep all of us entertained as well. Anyway hope u have a great break.
I hope you have a wonderful break and enjoy 4th of July
RIP Technoblade
Not on the hat ;-;
New sexy Grunty Boi shower scene. LETS GOOOOOOO
Ig that Arc phone wouldn't be pronounced arse phone no matter how Arceus would be pronounced actually🤔
I know you're going on a hiatus, but are you still going to do videos on John's channel?
hey man, take all the time you need.  We all need a break from time to time.  Been a fan for a few years now, and am glad I stuck around.  Looking forward to whatever you do when you have some time to rest.
Let’s goo
Take a break as long as you want we will support you with all we can  Ps: hopefully you are back by the time scarlet and violet come out
take a break !!
Go take a break, it doesn't matter, we will wait until you are back!  Hope your break goes well & take good carre of yourself!
You ok my dude.
10:49 the shiny form should be Perry the Platypus colored
👏🏻👏🏻Pokémon meme *REVIEW*
Grunty Boi pouring shampoo directly onto his hat heckin killed me! XD
01:58 Well you know what they say, if it's not 100% accurate it's 50% accurate
The wink
Go take a break Mikey we fine here.
It's ok Mikey, take all the time you need, im sure everyone here can agree that a break is worth your happiness and feeling of fulfillment (as well as better content you enjoy making)
Dude! My first random shiny was galarian yamask but I deleted the save 😥
I hope your break does you well, I've been wondering when you'd take some time off to relax a bit. When you do return, maybe something you could try is every once in a while trying out some of the fan made games (still pokemon games, but hopefully different enough to still stay exciting). But no matter what changes you make, you'll always have a fan in me.
Enjoy your break!!
Personal health is a priority. Honestly, while it is fun to watch, I wouldn't mind if a video didn't come out until Scarlet/Violet came out.  As far as the creative fulfillment, do what makes YOU happy. Not what makes us happy or what we may enjoy. Plus, who knows, this sabbatical could see a fan favorite Pokémon Talk come back
Hey man, take a well earned break, you definitely deserve it!
Mikey’s on sabbatical honey
I agree about the Chesnaut looking better quadrupedal it definitely looks better
try pokemon unite
You deserve a great break all your videos help me get through the time of covid. You even inspired me to make my own channel soon . i'm sad you will not be posting that much but have a great break.
Hey if you need a break, you don't really need a huge reason to do so. We'll miss the fun content but looking forward to what you think of when you come back!
Okay I just need to talk about this I agree with the fact that Chesnaught is so much better on four legs however incineroar and inteleon are based off of people so of course they're standing up and if it's a real problem that starters that are based off of animals that end up standing up when they shouldn't then why in the world aren't we talking about Pokemon like sceptile or Blastoise or Blaziken or feraligatr what about typhlosion I feel like the main reason people are getting pissy is cuz they're afraid that they're a furry seriously it's not a big deal what is a big deal is the fact that sprigatito needs to stay on all forms because we've already had a cat Pokemon that was on two legs instead of four
1:58 That's a whole 50% accuracy
Love you Mickey u take Al long of a break as u need
I have found 2 shinys accidently running into pokemon in the woild area and no shinys via mesuda method bro im cursed
You deserve this break bro your a true legend
Yay he's finally done... Now off to others
Orcane too Orcabrawl
You good man. I enjoy your content and even though I wish you had more new stuff, I understand you need time to relax. I almost lost my appeal to pokemon right before legends Arceus (Arcoos) and that fired me up. Take your time away. You've inspired me as well as countless other pokemon fans to want to become poketubers. Thank you for that. Your content is amazing and I cant wait till you come back
Aw man first jack the mickey welp john is gonna get a break next
Hey Mikey you deserve too have a long break
Take the time you need, Mykie. We'll be here whenever you're ready to continue.
Mikey a month or a year, whatever you need. I've been watching your content for almost a decade man, and loving it. You deserve it Michael Groth.
The new name for Orcane could be "Orcill", like Orca and Kill
Best to take a break before you hate it.
Take as much time as you need, and if you need ideas feel free to reach out to your community, maybe even branch out from pokemon a bit
So your going on hyatis? (Sorry if i spelled that wrong)
Here is an idea for when you come back, make a community post or a livestream where you ask for ideas from viewers and that could help with finding ideas and maybe help you find the bigger goals you talk about In the video. Have fun on your subatical we hope that you are fired up soon
Everything is so bad now....techno blade is gone, Mikey is leaving temporarily.
Orcane can be now called HORRICANE
WOT 1:08
Everyone will agree when I say you deserve a break. Have a great time off and enjoy every minute of it
Don't worry Mikey, enjoy your break and remember to actually take a break. I know you want to get progress with fixing everything in the house but remember to take a break and a breather k? Thanks for the wonderful videos and for keeping up with all the work, now enjoy your break cause you deserve it and I hope you remember to enjoy it. Keep being awesome you lovely man and we will be waiting for you when you come back ☺️  Also, thank grunty boi for the eye candy xD
All the best for your break Mikey! I hope you’ll able to relax and that you’ll find something that sparks your creative interest again, and something to work towards, whatever it might be!
Memes
With Scarlet & Violet coming up, this is a great moment to take a break. Enjoy, Mikey! We'll miss you.
Alright Mikey take this time destress take a brake and chill I know I’m going to be bummed about the break but I will keep supporting all your content in whatever way I can have fun.
Enjoy your break!
Everyone needs a break sometimes so we all understand
I am sorry you are going through this mandjtv
Take your time Mikey go recharge your batteries then come back stronger then ever. Just like AZ in XY we can wait 3,000 years. Love you man see you soon 🫡😉😁👋🏽
Have a nice rest. Please get some good R&R and see you when you return. :)
Thanks for giving a heads up about your sabbatical. I hope it's relaxing and rejuvenating. We'll miss getting new content from you. But hey, we can always go rewatch old stuff if we need that MandJTV fix.
We'll miss you, but enjoy your break and very excited for what's next I'm sure it'll be awesome 😁
You are a great YouTuber and we will miss you, but you've made so many good vids we can rewatch so have a great time!
I respect Mikey for his decision
I feel the pain Mikey, I’ve been trying to be a YouTuber for a while, and may I just say, it is DIFFICULT to try to make a decent upload schedule.
Mikey, Nooooo!  In all seriousness, I'm glad you're taking care of yourself. You are a highly valued member of this community, and we want you to be well. We look forward to your return!
We love you Mikey, take as much time as you need.
Its okay mikey take all the break you want we would still care about you
Mikey, is it me or are you slowly assuming the appearance of Chuck Norris?
Hey Mikey do u play fire emblem?? It would be cool if u would respond B)
Emboar is lechonks cool uncle that takes him to ice cream shops and amusement parks change my mind
Noooooooooooooooooo
(about the banner)  but I thought if it's not 100% accurate it's 50% accurate 😢😢😢
(LOADS of supportive hugs) take care of yourself! we will be here when you decide to come back! <3 your health comes first!
Gonna miss the videos while you're gone, but please do take care of yourself As someone who knows the value of a good mental state I'm glad to hear you wanna protect yourself from burnout  If I could suggest an idea (you don't have to listen to me, it's just an idea) you could try to do something that Markiplier does and post short animated bits from audio you already have You'd have to hire an animator, but it gives you more time to breath in between videos
As long as you just record the meme review for next month your good. No edits just record for when you come back.
enjoy your time off, you deserve it:)
No worries bro, put yourself first
When Mikey comes back, if he plans on continuing youtube for a while, he should  only post every two weeks so he doesn't get burnt out.  Also I know it's been over a year, but there's always pixelmon content, like PokéSMP.  I doubt it makes a return but I CAN HOPE
I'm gonna miss have your content every weekend, your channel became a fun part of my weekend, like a ritual. Anyway, I support your sabatical, you deserve it! Rest, Mikey! We will still be here whenever you want to post new content, take your time
We love you man take a break and relax. Cant wait for your time in Scarlet and Violet. Love you man!!
Maybe you need to take a page from Jwittz and some other Youtubers and expand your content to include other stuff too. I think you're popular enough that you can now make content that isn't 100% Pokemon related work.
I'm just happy you will come back I like watching your videos
he shampooed his hat
mandjtv fans on their way to quote the exact same thing every time mikey says a percentage         1:56 I F   I T S  N O T   1 0 0   P E R C E N T   A C C U R A T E   I T S   5 0   P E R C E N T   A C C U R A T E
i’m so sad mikey ended up like norman osborn he’s on sabbatical honey
See ya Mikey:(
Why does buizel bro’s magiraffe have a rinnegan
Mikey I am 0:45 so that Hoodie will put me in danger
Burnout is something I face often with my own passions. It sucks hard when it happens, and avoiding it is good. Take your time. As much as ya need. Peace man! Love the videos.
Otosum needs to be on my team of Berry pickers along with Bidoof, Pachiresu, and Squovet
I look forward to seeing you return and I hope that when you do you’ll eventually return to doing Pokémon types then verses now series
actually the professors are named after trees
Take as much time as you need to recharge...your fans love your content, and will all still be here when you come back
Mikey just gotta say I’ve been watching for years and the amount of videos and the consistency has been excellent so take as much time as you need to recharge before making some new exciting content for scarlet and violet
“alright pig pals, that was a nice nap, time to wake up”  “uhm what about spoink?”  “probably a heavy sleeper”  “but I don’t see him breathing”  “wait what?”  “Spoink?”  *”s p o i n k ?”*
I hope you take your time and get your rest and your energy up again💙💛
Take a break Mikey we all support you :)
Grunty boy putting shampoo on his hat really makes me think about the Jotaro hair arguement, and it could apply here.
E
This is good news. Mikeys break could help him enjoy the main channel more and could help with stuff that he wants and maybe the return of more pationant videos for things that he hasn’t done in a while
You've been working hard for eight years, you deserve this vacation.
Mikey:  *gets a new bathroom*  Gruntyboi:  OUR
Enjoy the rest buddy! I love your content and can't wait to see what you come back strong with!
Love your content, take the time to take care of yourself
Good job on you Mikey. Your mental health is more important then our enjoyment, and I’m serious on it. I don’t want you to be mentally exhausted, and you deserve this vacation.
Take some time for yourself buddie, no need to put a date on it when you will be back, just enjoy life a bit ^^. Youtube will be here when you will get back.
Emboar I like alot better on four legs tepig is my favorite starter (first form only)
Man that hurt i even felt that one 0:01
Can't wait to see what comes next for you, Mikey!! Enjoy your sabbatical and thanks for all the work you do!!
Mikey hit his eye with sweater claps Pokemon meme review Mikey god it hit me in the eye 😂
1:59 you mean 50% accurate
We’ll miss u Mikey but if u need break take one
I really appreciate the consistent quality of content Mikey has provided us for nearly a decade! He should take all the time off he wants, he more than deserves it!
Orcana
19:14… just keep staring at the dartoad and you will see it
Why not try out Pokemon Rom Hacks? There are a lot of great ones, it’s a bit fresher than repeating a game you’ve already played and often times more interesting.
Enjoy your break Michael
Never noticed how built Grunty Boy/ Mikey is
Mikey, in my opinion, your mental health and stability is way more important than some videos. Take the time that u need to relax and see you soon
Prophesee is just an ender pearl with a face and a tablecloth
Enjoy your break sir! I‘m always all for YouTubers taking breaks, always better for the creator and the content in the long run!
😭
Take your time Mikey, all of us will patiently wait for your return ❤❤❤
Grunty boi: TIME FOR SEXY SHOWER MONTAGE 2.0!!!
Take as much time as you need! Continuously grinding is exhausting, ESPECIALLY when you move in the middle of it. Everyone needs a break. You’re an amazing content creator (and the 1st of many poketubers I subscribed to). :)  You’ve more than earned this break.  :)  Get your house in order and get everything unpacked and in its place (the effect that that alone has on one’s mental health is insane). Take as long as you need to figure things out and get your creative juices flowing again. :)  We’ll all be here when you make your return. :)
my first wild shiny was an absol which killed itself with perish song
It could be orcrool
Blub
Cool
Mikey's got bad luck, I got a shiny stakataka with no shiny charm randomly
Talking about random shinys i found a gigantamax shiny toxicatry
Breaks are important!
Take your time, but please come back! :)
*Exhale.* Why this man so hot?
Completely understand dude you got to do what is best for you because without you there’s no team sky or grunti boy so take the time you need to recharge the juices
I really want smolive to evolve into swolive
Hope I appear in this Meme Review, would really love your reactions to how I design Flop Flap, Baturty, Trainin & Orcane
i hope your break helps you! :) thanks for a the hard work until now
Well it is said to see no new content for a while, but if you need a break just take it. Your health is more important than frequent uploads.
I have a suggestion for Orcane! What about Orcanyon?
Sup
me 🤝mikey both getting a random shiny g. yamask
Grunty boy putting shampoo on his hat
Enjoy the break mikey been a fan since 2016 and I never get sick of your content enjoy yourself my man
It's pixeldip all over again
I completely support your break ima miss you tho.
it's fine that you're taking a break, everyone needs one and if someone here really wants to watch more of your videos they can just go back and watch old ones cause you have a lot. take as long as you need dude.  also i was gonna draw the pokemon to try and appear in this video but i didnt feel up to it and i never really use reddit anyway
I never understood what aspitipiay meant
:(
Good luck with the sabbatical! Everybody needs time to decompress, especially regarding creative work, and it's a very commendable decision! I offer two pieces of unsolicited advice: try out a VERY different and niche hobby while away (i.e pottery or archery); and try to remind yourself that you do not owe creating content to anybody (brand deals aside, of course). Beterschap!
Lights out? more like eyes out for Mikey
We love you and await your return.
mikey: takes a break and goes out of his house for a month grunty boi with dr. squatch soap: it showerin' time
Hey appreciate u opening up with ur fans. Maybe u could hire a team to do the main time consuming part of ur content. Like u come up with an idea and ur team does the research but u r still finalizing the work and recording the video. That way u dont have to sit through hours doing research for a single video while ur team does the data collection. This is just a suggestion I thought might help u through ur dilemma with ur main channel.
grunty boi winking at me was weirdly arousing😱
The mikey pokemon fanart was genuinely incredible! Very different but all super talented!
Have a fulfilling sabbatical! We’ll be here when you get back
Dang I was late to post my art, I hope you will still do meme review next month cause I made a evolution for your ghost type: falscourge
take a break Mikey we will wait
Getting the running shoes after Brock was agony. Like why did it take Game Freak so long to have running be default?
Born too late to explore the world Born too early to explore the cosmos Born just in time to appreciate Michael’s cathartic physique
UHHH MIKEY A GIRL WITH PSYCHIC POWERS IS HERE TO SEE U SOMETHIN ABOUT A VEC wht was it OH YE VECNA
Mikey, you have a beard and you're leaving for no one knows how long. Stop reminding me of my dad  I'm joking of course :) Take as much time as you need! Much love,and thank you for your hard work and the great entertainment! <3
Take your time, Mikey! If you need a break, you need it!
Name replacement for Orcane; Orcataur (from Orca and Minotaur)
844th
my younger brother found a shiny cufant BEFORE getting the shiny charm his luck is insane
844th
i think you should react to lumiose trainer zachs own region it has pokemon you would like
The fact that you're willing to commit to the shower bit is honestly the best 👌
Early I think
Dose ANYONE realize That Grunty Boi appears when a meme of Grunty Boi  Pops up ;)
Take care of yourlelf, Leader. Have a good break, we will wait for your return
I don't care if mikey doesn't upload for a month, i can watch that grunty boi shower montage on repeat for 10 times however long mikey leaves for
I just want to say You are my favorite YouTuber and can’t wait for some clips hope you feel better
take a good time for you mikey, we love your content and we'll be waiting for you when you're ready
If nobody else does, I support your break, mate!
I couldn't relate more to an intro oof.  Also hope break will be epic! Burnout as a youtuber happens sometimes, a break would be a epic idea to regain your psychical and mental energy.
I like how grunty boy was using shampoo but he squeeze in to its hat
Watching the intro in .25 playback speed is the funniest thing I’ve seen in a long time.
I’m very sad that Mikey didn’t mention Tecnho Blade’s death I know this was recorded earlier But still he could add a clip of memes about that.
The dragon type you made was my favourite
Have a good rest Mikey
Claim your 1 hour ticket here
I am sad that this was recorded before Moxie2D's video
Enjoy your break man!
I wake up without my coffee and I see this? Best morning ever!
Who recorded you shower? Asking for a friend
During these promos Mikey is going to get demonitized…
6:25 why'd he put the soap on his hat?
34136th
Somebody throw this man a super potion for self inflicted critical hitting himself.
Grunty Boi: Mikey is on sabbatical, honey.
If you live youtube I will still remember  youuuuuuuu forever😭😭😭😣😖😞
nooooooooo😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭Don't go
Hearing Mikey say he's taking a break... understood... Will miss anticipating type then vs now videos and watching meme review  But your health is more important
people need to stop asking him to do nuzlockes its hurting are noble lord
Hey, I fully understand your descision. Currently I am doing a sabatical as well. I felt worn out and didnt know what I actually want in my life. A friend of mine told me, because she was worried about my well being "I think you need a break. A long break, just to get clear and calm again". This let me ponder and after a few weeks I decided to do it. It can be very helpful to allow yourself to take the time you need to figure things out. I hope your sabatical will help you and just take your time. You dont let anyone down. Its good you put yourself first! Best of luck ♥
You go ahead and take your break and to recharge your mental and creative batteries Mikey. We'll be here when you get back, I promise. I hope you have a fun time and a wonderful 4th of July!
Farewell Michael, farewell
Welp Hopefully you’ll feel better with making videos Mikey
You should watch Moxie’s video it’s really good on drawing your Pokémon
Michy you take a break when you need to.
I was worried for a hot minute when you said this was your last.. until you said it was a break.. have fun dude, relax and come back more fired up, maybe play something other than Pokemon during that time since honestly even casually I have burned myself out on Pokemon before by just playing various regions over and over, like legit I did an Ice run in Sword.. started getting bored of that, so my solution was trying to play a casual playthrough of Ultra Moon since I haven't done that in awhile but then got bored of it since somehow having a balanced team got boring.. so my "break" was starting a Rock run in X... none of my challenges are done.. and I don't even make videos these are just for fun.. but god the burn out  I just hope maybe you still pop up in like PM7 and PlurpleCliffe videos since.. they your friends and whatnot.. but obviously you do what you want to do.. but it would be funny to be like "oh ya I am still doing Pokemon content.. just not mine! Make others edit and think of ideas!"
Have fun and don't over work your self moving in
Rest with ease, you need it.
Take all the time you need. I can't say for your other fans, but I will be here when you decide to return.  Please just keep us updated on how you are.  And I sooooo get the script writing comment. I'm a college student myself and I know if I am just not in the right mood to write a paper, I'm going to do a crap job on it.
How to beat team Sky's leader: give him a hoodie!
Hahahahaha grunty boy
Rip mikey eyes...
Enjoy some time off Mikey and focus on you and your health much love
That shower montage was creepy
How about orceatus for the orca fakemon
BBYYYYEEEE MIKEY have a good vacation
Nobody:  Grunty Boi: (puts shampoo on his hat)
Have a great Vacation Mikey
Good for you, taking a break Mikey! Enjoy the rest of your summer!
The banner is 50% accurate!!!
grunty boy why
I am early bois
You’ve taken breaks before and will again and we will always be ready and waiting for your return!
I understand, take your time Mikey.
It's good you're taking a break everyone needs one, take as long as you would like
This was Funny.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
I was just watching the lestonks meme review and Another lechonk meme review was uploaded...
Name orcane orking
17:24 They made Chesnaught a pangolin and it made Chesnaught cuter :> Edit: Also gladly take the break you needed Mikey, if need you could try a schedule of bi-weekly uploads. Bi-weekly in the sense of 1 vid every 2 weeks, because bi-weekly could also mean twice a week and that would just burn you out more, but again take your breaks when needed
My eyes got burned due to how hot grunty boi is
Okay hear me out…Lechonk should get wings in his next evolution for the “when pigs fly” saying. Have a great break Mikey!
Thank you for all your hard work Mikey 💟 Enjoy your break, you deserve it!!
When u realise cherubi is number 420 and it’s literally a plant…
Taking a break is always important. Do what you need to do to get refreshed
The socials aren’t 100% acurate so it’s 50% acurate
Be back for the new games. That's all I ask.
We love you Mikey
:)
Hi Mikey! First time I’m here before 1 hour after the video! I wanted to ask you when are you gonna do a TEAM SKY video in Unova?
Mate, if you want to take a break, you take a break. We'll wait :D
holy crap i just realized that shiny yamask is a square shiny and one of my favorite shinies im so jealous  also have a good break :)
Enjoy your vacation Mikey! You deserve it
Take you're break man, quality over quantity
Michael. i love your channels. youre honest and so fun to watch. take your time, im sure many are going to be here wishing you a good rest. youre awesome
Take your time, burnout is harsh. We'll still be here when you get back. Have fun on your break!
I think we all understand why you need this break, so don't worry, take a good break, as long as you need, and we'll be as patient as possible. (P.S. I would have said 99.9% of us understand, but if it is not 100% accurate it is 50% accurate.)
Don't worry take all the time you need. I want you to be happy with what you make on YouTube. figure out everything, we all need a break sometimes.
Rip his eye. So relateable.
Mikey: I won't be uplooading anymore Me: HE'S RETIRING??? Mikey: For about a month Me: O cool
The fact that grunty boy puts soap on his hat is hilarious.
Enjoy your break Mikey. You deserve it!
Lechonk is gonna be my second shiny no matter how it looks
Someone should introduce Cosmoth to Volcarona so that they can stop un-aliving themselves trying to get to the actual sun
You should watch moxies video of making your pokemon
Yes! You’ve deserved a break for so long Mikey!
Well enjoy your breack
So you cqn say the merch is comfy and easy to wear?
Don’t worry we will support mandjtv even if you aren’t here as much :) just make sure you can make work you are satisfied with rather than something to give as filler aight?
2:41 ive only seen that art style in one othet place...
55$ for a hoodie? Nah
1:59 if its not 100% accurate its 50% accurate and u said 33%
do not worry mr. Groth, everybod needs breaks and you deserve it. I'll be waiting for your epic return
We don't want you to burn out so take as long as you need buddy
Take your time, take all the time you need.
You could rename it orcane to orbane
About the professor names, it's entirely possible they are still named afrer trees; Madagascar Periwinkle, also known as Sada Bahar, and a type of dragon tree known as Dracaena Arturo  While it's not a guarantee, since "pasado" and "futuro" are the more obvious connection, Pokémon as a series thrives on multi-layered names and references. I can't absolutely say whether it played a part, but I'd say it's a real possibility
Jurasik park 😂😂😂
good
For a runariges all you need to do is have your yamask below half health and still alive and I have to go under a very specific Rock in like the desert area of the wild zone
Enjoy your break, Mikey!
Before 1 hour
enjoy your break Mikey! take your time getting into the swing of things!
"greeting boogie fans"
Michael moxie2D drew all of your'e pokemon you came up with in the last vid
take your time Mikey, you have earn it. :)
The professors are named after trees just ones that don't currently exist a turo is a theoretical tree with lights that grow on it that may or may not exist in the future while a Sada is an extinct tree
You did great, Mikey! You can rest now. You deserve it!
Only Grunty Boi can use shampoo with hat on the head.
Enjoy your time off, Mikey!  We'll be here waiting to when you get back. :D
I will miss mikey's content ik he will upload but it will take a long time as he said and I hope he still has fun during this break
6:17 grunty boy to every viewer: I diagnose you with chronic homosexuality
It is all good we all need a break sometimes  hope you have a good break
You should play more romhacks
So is the hat a part of grunty boy’s anatomy now?
10:47  Lotad:am i a joke to you?
Enjoy your break Mikey ♥️
Take all the time you need to rest bro your true fans will stick with you
I also recently decided to take the reins on my own happiness and fulfillment too. I’m only a few days in so can’t speak much for the results but I can say at least from what I know now you’re making the right choice! With anything in life it’s always best to take a step back as soon as you can realize it’s not going somewhere sustainable. I think work burnout is really important to address because not only does it tear you down emotionally, but if that starts hindering your ability to work it can eventually add on financial stress as well which no one needs in todays market. Take the time you need! Whatever you decide is the right course of action, I’ll still be a fan!
11:28
Saxolotle's comics are fantastic, but they just don't feel complete until Mikey reads them out loud xD
I will miss your uploads but I’ll just continue rewatching the other stuff. Take your time and I hope this break helps a lot. <3 feel better
For your orca-inspired pokemon, might I suggest Orccost? (Orca + accost) You could still go either water/fighting or water/dark.
Love your content
That intro is basically, trying to be too cool, and failing miserably! 🤣
I’m kinda sad that Moxie’s interpretation of Mikey’s pokemon didn’t make it in. Especially his doomoose, that was really cool.
Have a nice break!
Take as long as you need you deserve it
I was playing Pokémon quest while watching and got a shiny krabby as soon as the shiny tanka clip played
Nice
LeChonk is gonna be the next Bidoof.
Leave ur entries!
Is pokemon talk coming back after the hiatus?
You will be missed but everyone deserves a break! Enjoy your break and relax!
Does any one else ever just go LEDRIP when you see lechonk
I have yet to draw ur Pokémon
Only 33 percent acurate on the banner is actually 50 percent accurate
Ahh yes,soap so good that you can just put it in your hat and it still works
You will be missed Mikey.
For any TECHNOBLADE fans REMEMBER TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES HE WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US
Personally I want to say that most of the reason I watch your videos is because your personality is really entertaining, and not just because of the content
Yeah take a break it's totally fine you need it
hi
Hi I’m Drippy Tom
9:56 I mean by pokemon card logic you are correct
Have a good time off for your deserved time because we dont want you feeling drained MandJTV
Gonna miss you 😢
9:56 I mean by pokemon card logic you are correct
Enjoy some time off you earned it dude
You deserve this break. I don't know what it means to be pressured to post A LOT of videos on 2 channels, and making ideas for videos. But I know its tiring. You deserve this break! Stay safe, god bless. ❤️
That intro is relateble somehow
12:45 I think cos moth can’t go well with volcarona man :/
something that worked for me in terms of creativity is not forcing it  the best ideas ideas come from random moments not forced thinking . additionally something that also worked for me in terms of forcing creativity is to be physically satisfied well fed, hydrated and well rested and while being in this state either sit in complete silence or if you have problems with attention spam is listening to music without lyrics or nature sounds like rain or campfire sounds. usually this gets me so calm to a point a where my mind sits at piece .
We understand Mikey, take all the time u want :) <3
We understand Mikey! Enjoy your break!☺
I take blue and red pill
have fun with your break!
Thanks for letting us know
A NEW SHOWER MONTAGE LET'S GOOOOOO XD
1:59 A foolish miscalculation! It’s 50% accurate!
Have a lovely break and so glad you are taking time for you mental health.
6:13 why did you put that image in my head lol
Check out Moxie2D’s video on your Pokémon art you’ll be stunned!
It's okay, do what you need to until you get better. We don't want another pokemon talk happening
Take as much time as you need. We will miss you, but we will be here when you come back. Take care of yourself first. Mental health is so important
Enjoy your break mikey, recharge to your fullest and have fun
Enjou your break and everyone who loves you and your content will be waiting
Hello everyone hope your doin well
That shower scene is going to be on a certain website
Enjoy the break Mikey, definitely deserved 🙌
Enjoy your sabbatical Mikey!  Love your work
i wonder if the pokemon creators consider some of these fakemons before
That fact that youtubers have to go to extreme lengths to explain sabbaticals to make an audience not angry, is just plain sad. People need to realize when it’s time for them to take a break.  All in all, I hope you enjoy your break Mikey, everyone deserves one when they need it
My mom doesn't speak English, and now I have to explain to her why the hell I was watching some smoking hot grunty boy showering in slow motion
I understand everybody need to break some times i feel Like that sometimes too
Hiiiiiii mikey
It's understandable, people sometimes need a break because of burnout. Hope you have a great day.
Take as long as you need bro, we want you to feel better more than we want you to make content!
Understandable I hope you’re happy during that time, because you definitely deserve a break thank you for doing this for us 😁
i like how the shampoo/conditioner is strictly landing on grunty boi's hat :)
Enjoy your break
Nice introbro
Micheal: explaining why he needs a break The music in the background: upbeat, WOO! happy tango
Ormane
2:54 thats the whole point of lechonk, it’s named after a dish commonly eaten in Spain, lechon. Nothing is wrong with them.
Enjoy the break man!! To admit that you need time away shows that you care more about the content you put out than a pay check, which will only makes us as your true fans love you more. Looking forward to your return whenever that may be!!!
I have a been a follower for a long time and believe you deserve this vacation.Lots of love and really love your content🥰🤗✌️
Hi Mikey
Good luck
I miss the gamer googles, also ow that looked like it hurt!
You need to react to Moxie2D's versions of your Pokemon. The video is great!!!
Hey you deserve a good ol sabbatical enjoy it
Dude I love your vids I think it’s ok to take breaks take as much time as you need your videos always brighten my days 😀
Enjoy your break Mikey!!
I cant believe it! My post got showed! It was brief and not notable but I still can't believe it. PS my post was the prhopesee art   -Clover
dr squatch knowing that nobody is skipping mikey's ads
441st one here
Here under an hour, second time in a roll. *I'm* on a roll!
You need a break. Hope you are refreshed after your break.
When gamer sups grunty boi version coming out?
Hope you rest up and feel refreshed Mikey!
Hey man you take your break and enjoy it. When you return it’s gonna be epic
For people who didnt get it -  SPOINK bounces around on its tail. The shock of its bouncing makes its heart pump. As a result, this POKéMON cannot afford to stop bouncing - if it stops, its heart will stop.
The way grunty Boi put shampoo on his hat me 😆
Michael: And that is burn out. Blaine: Hah! You better have *BURNHEAL*
I feel like Terrakidd might just be the person having forgotten the extra leg and trying to, and succeeding in, covering up the mistake
Hey, take the time you need. We all will await your return.
Us boogie fans are revied turn on captions
The hunter had castform oh hail no
Grunty boy is the best Team Rocket Grunt
Brawlive looks like a Smolive evolution
a good break is always healthy. Remember to take care of yourself too
Grunty boy shower remix
See ya soon
Have a good break! Can't wait to see more from you again
Hey man I totally get the burnout thing. As someone who's been watching you since the sun and moon prerelease hype I've often been impressed with how regular you've kept your uploads and quality over the years  Take the time you need fam
take your time mikey. we’ll be here to watch what you make when you get back!
I've never understood why people are so obsessed with Pokémon needing to be quadruped instead of bipedal. No offense to that artist, but I think all four of those looked worse. So many of those Pokémon just lose their personalities by going quadruped and just look too animalistic. Pokémon that are just animals are some of the worst designs out there in my opinion. They're boring and barely feel like Pokémon. Incineroar as a heel wrestler is way more interested than a fire tiger is. There are some quadrupeds that would benefit as bipedal, like Samurott, and there's been bipedal Pokémon that shouldn't be based on their animals that people would never change (Blastoise, Charmander/Charmeleon, Typhlosion, Feraligatr, Sceptile, and Swampert).
Mike uses cool . He hurt him self in his confusion
Good luck on your break Mikey, regardless of how long you are gone. You won't be forgotten, because you truly are an amazing content creator. I've been enjoying all of your recent videos, especially the competitions with John/PM7.
He’s probably not reading this but I think you might be able to make a collab channel with pm7 purpleclife and yourself where you can post anything you like and I would be a good way for pm7 and purplecliffe fans to find out about you but don’t post frequently on this channel I could just be like once every 2 months or something like that
It’s ok man there’s nothing wrong with talking a break
I think I speak for the whole of your channel, we love your videos because your passionate about the content you make. We're all glad to see you step back if it means that you will come back with a smile and the love for your craft!
Mandjtv used rest
For anyone who doesn't understand the part with spoink is that it says in the pokadex that if spoink stops bouncing he will die
I support you
I found a shiny gollerck but I killed it
Video idea: playing pokemon charades in minecraft. Create pokemon in minecraft in a time limit then let the other person guess. I got this idea after rewatching your minecraft videos lol.   Have fun in your break and see you after your break :)
Take care of yourself, sir. You deserve it.
Go ahead and take a break! I'll be binging your old videos to help keep your revenue up
Hey Mikey, enjoy the vacation reset, we will be here waiting patiently when you are ready!
Why hasn't grunty Boi, just switch to team sky
Have a great break Mikey, you truly deserve it and I hope you can come up with great ideas when you come back!
35 mins
Really hope you figure out the solution to your stasis contents and hope to see new and exciting projects real soon Mikey. Love your videos and really wish you a great vacation from YouTube.
Hey Mikey take the time you need to sort yourself out, we'll still be here when you get back. Provided the world doesn't end.
hey man, its good to have some time to recharge, i am also having a burn out recently, so i can feel that
moxie2d made your pokemon too on youtube
Me a stupid person who wants the jacket: "Guess I'll die."
I like the new t-shirt M and JTV
Good luck Mikey you deserve this break 👍🏻
Me not beeing able to sleep went up to 60h but after that The melatonin kicked in and i finally was able to sleep... For 15h
I like to think that Mikey and Grunty boi hang out off screen talking about random brands.
Mikey leaving: Sad The music: HAHAHAHA dududududuuuduu
If you want to try New video games in the vacation you should try phantom dust
Gruntyboy shower scene.
4:04 Hol'up Also, it's totally fine if you need to take a break from youtube, it can be really hard work at times. Us Pokefans will always be there for you :)
Mikey’s Banner is 33% accurate… So you know what that means: if it’s not 100% accurate, it’s 50% accurate.
Grunty boy puts the bar straight onto his body without a rag or loofa? Maybe he is evil
Goddamn it GRUNTY BOI not again 😆😆
It's ok King, take your time, we'll be ready to have you back when you're back
I’m Glad that you are giving yourself a break! This also gives jack and john a chance to do chalenges with each other and their channels would get on a closer level to you.
you deserve a break!! we'll be here for your return, pokemaster.
6:17 yo sick new shower Mikey, it even has a holder for soap and shampoo
NOOO I was too slow! Everyone’s versions of your Pokémon designs looks awesome though :)  Enjoy your break Mikey, I 100% understand burnout as an artist and I have no idea how you’ve been this consistent on YouTube for this long
Do what you got to do Michael stay healthy and keep going when you can
Well hey  Hope for Minecraft videos on the plays channel at least Hope you get that rest
Lol best intro i have ever seen 😂
Intro: *gets hit by his hood* Mikey: Why would omanyte do this to me?
Have an awesome sabatical mikey and your return will be greatly awaited
Take as long of a break as you need
16:50 hes not the only one if u rematch Gardenia she has a choice scarf sunflora with only solar beam and Roark has a relicanth that only has choice band and head smash and Volkner will have a drizzle pelipper
do a run of pokemon idc what game but do randomized eggs
While I'm going to be bummed out that you're going to be taking a break, I can also understand why you're doing it.  Enjoy your sabbatical and I can't wait until you return! 🙂🙂🙂
Don't worry Mikey we as the community understand your saturation so please take your break we will wait as long as we have to and when you finally decide that your ready to return to us we will make sure you have 2 million subs on the main channel and 1 million subs on the gaming channel
what hit him in the eye
everybody needs a break!! especially when you’re in a creative thing. if anyone gives him crap about taking a break, you will meet my metaphorical blade!!
Don’t worry about us Mikey. I hope you have a great break. You deserve it!
What the f*** mikey
It's ok, Mikey, take all the time you need.
I was absolutely OBSESSED with your content when I found it last year and absolutely BINGED all of it.... TWICE. I've wanted to buy stuff from your site store for a while now, and just never got around to it (no matter how badly I wanted plush Michael and Mytey 😭), but I just went and bought a hoodie, cause my desire to support you just increased even HIGHER....even if I'm risking injury by getting it apparently 🤔 but I just wanted you to know that I love you as much as any random fan of a wildly popular (and attractive) celebrity can, and I know whatever you do will be amazing 💖
Everyone deserves a long break! I fully empathize with the burnout. I've definitely been feeling similarly as stuff I usually love doing just takes time and eventually I just stop enjoying it as much. So take as much time as you need. I will continue to stay subscribed to you. I love your videos and content!
6:17 OH DEAR GOD NOT AGAIN! NOT AGAI-
Subscribe
You go ahead and take a break my friend, no doubt you need one especially after moving into a new place.
Well another YouTuber I watch just came out of a month long hiatus, so I'm used to this.
Please stop in dont
I hope this break helps you I will miss you but I understand that you need a break.
Glad your taking time for you love your channels hope to see you again
We under, take a good rest Mikey
We understand, Happy vacations 😁😁😄
Mikey: This jacket is not a threat to your safety unless you're as stupid as I am. Me: WELP, HAVE TO SKIP THIS MERCH LINE. SORRY MIKEY.
I hope you have fun Mikey
This video reminded me of Mikey being the hottest pokétuber
Why
Is it just me or does Mikey look more handsome?
Take a rest man you earned it (and you need it)
It's good he's taking a break but I kinda hoped he was talking the break to get married
Its my birthday today
Enjoy your well-deserved break. We'll be waiting for your return. 😊☺️
Don't worry Mikey, we all understand! (I think) You've posted a lot of content for us to rewatch and nitpick and all sorts of things. Plus, we have the subreddit for entertainment. And if that gets tired after a while John and Jack will always be ready with some new content. Enjoy your vacation Mikey! (Hopefully this doesn't go down like Pokemon Talk)
I’ll see you soon m8
mickey
omg when he put the shampoo on his hat i almost choked
He said the banner is 33% accurate so its really 50% average
Moxie did a video about the new Pokémon
Dude, it’s summer, you chill and recharge 👌
We will wait you mickey.. 😊😊
It's alright Mikey.... take ur time.....and of course we're ur fans after all *hug
I can't be the only one who thinks that it would be ironic to put a deadline on your relaxation period to recover from the pressure of having to meet deadlines at a rapid pace. Take all the time you need Mikey. I will still enjoy watching your videos while you take your break.
Lechonk is our savior
Mikey: only 33% accuracy ! Me: Dont you mean 50% accuracy???
Don't worry about it. We all need breaks for our health. The community will understand and you will get stronger. Don't ever forget we're on your side here. And plus, if you happen to play a game just for fun, record it just for fun and put it on the plays Channel unedited and have a good time with it. Of course I hope you will still do me review in about a month but if not then you'll just to do a double memes review when you get back and be awesome
🙏 🙏 POkEmoN meME REvIEw
You should change Orcane to Warcane
I salute you Mickey you are my favorite YouTuber and I will be missing you but taking care of yourself is amazing
I hope the little dragon castform is a regional variant in gen 9
0:19 What the hell!!? Obviously they do stink!!
Take as much time as u need to, and I hope u feel fully refreshed when u come back.
I'm sorry for your eye but I enjoyed the video and keep it up
I get burnt out with Pokémon after playing 1 or 2 games, but I always come back. You’ve been playing AND pumping out content for YEARS. I will miss your videos since your my favorite YouTuber, but you deserve a break :)
the intro made me laugh so hard! great video once again
ha lol i just got my myghty plushy
“Sabbatical”, do you mean “Hiatus”?  But otherwise, hope everything works out.
Take as much time as you need! Your life is more important the YouTube. So take as much time as you need
It makes me sad when YouTubers think they can’t take a break cause “they need to post” take time for yourself we get it!
POV you watch the rambly part at the end but mostly to see the sign off (I'm kidding I watched the rambley part at the end to make sure you were okay and it wasn't for like health reasons or anything like that)
LECHONK
Boi
Enjoy your hiatus Mikey!
hello! I love aspitipy and I just wanted to tell you you’re doing a great job!
Lets'go sexy grunty bou
jalamoto is my fav
I'm happy you had the self awareness to know you needed a sabbatical.  So many people just keep ploughing ahead and don't realize it until they destroy their love for whatever they're working on.   I'll miss your new stuff while your gone, but I entirely understand!  Recharge them battery-turtles, and we'll be here when you get back!
I hope he dosnt become one of those lazy youtubers like Jaiden Animations who posts like 1 thing every 3 months
Have a wonderful break Mikey💕💕 we’ll miss you of course, but we will be here when you decide to return 😊😊
That is evolution
The quadraped starters made chesnaught look like a Megatherium
"Since Pokemon hasn't made a platypus Pokemon", Psyduck and Golduck ceased to exist.
nice vid Mikey! you really need them gamer goggles thp
We love you take care man!!
Have a great break from YT Mikey!
Its okay you really deserve a break :)
Just a heads up, if you are going to be taking a while off, be really careful about it. Coz whenever that seems to happen there’s a very good chance they will lose relevance and popularity quickly and when you return you’ll only have a fraction of the views you did before. Happened to so many YouTubers and I don’t want it to happen to u
The pokemon look more like neopets...
9:33. This was actually the shiny i got on my playthrough of sword. I was doing it wonder trade style however i found this on a route and not wonder trade so i wasn't giving it up.
Dont worry mikey just take a break all of us will wait patiently
We always love Grunty Boi & the more content/playthroughs he adds the better!
1:58 If it isn't 100% accurate it's 50% accurate.
Wow… Technoblade dies and now this! GOD WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS!
@MandJTV i hope yuor going to have a great break i hope you get the burnout out of your sistem.  Love your loving fan
That hoodie took revenge cuz u replaced castform with mytey (I don't hate your change but the hoodie is mad)
Love the content but glad you are taking care of your health too!
They should put a eye poking warning on the hoodie
Take all the time you need, we will be here when you come back, rest and recover burn out is no joke
wonder where he got the pokemon towel from
I love your videos mikey have a good day
Hope you get a good rest and finish moving in, love your videos
17:02 *The french Anthem fades slowly fades in*
17:25 Honestly i dont like those 4 mons as quadrupeds, as i feel that kinda goes against each of their themes. Chesnaught is a knight, Incineroar is a wrestler, Inteleon is a spy, and Emboar is literally a reference to the pig king from journey to the west. If those 4 stood on 4 legs, i feel that inspiration would be lost  (also i personally prefer bipedal starters mainly because to me that makes them feel more like the kinda partners that i feel starters are meant to be but that's just my two cents. i won't dog on people who prefer quadrupedal starters)
Don't feel like you're in the wrong taking a vacation, we all need breaks at one point :)
i was watching a pokemon meme review then i saw that this got uploaded Edit:just finished watching this video take a break if you want we will always wait
your beard is good
i love these dr squatch sponsors🤣
Hey you leave my boi Chesnaught out of that meme! T-T Hes my precious boi and no one will tell me otherwise that he looks better on all four!!!
Hey Mikey it's fine have a break as long as you want also I love your videos
8:15 why not ✨ _Arse_ ✨ phone
Hey man, everyone needs a break to let the creative energies build up again. You take as long as you need Mikey, we got plenty of amazing videos we can rewatch 😁
I hope u enjoy your break! Hope u are able to recharge!!
Bro take all the time in the world
Thank you Mikey, I am in need of copium
every sponsorship with Grunty Boi is great but him putting soap on his hat was the icing on the cake for this one lMAO
finally more aspitapay
Take as long as you need for your break, YouTube can be a lot sometimes.
have a great sabatico
Among us
Sorry no murder hoodie for me
So yeah it is 33% accurate *if it’s not 100% accurate it’s 50% accurate*
The one at 10:37 is a really hard choice for me. Half of my favorite starters are on one side and the other half are on the other!
Good for him, everyone needs a break. Hope to see you exited for scarlet and violet.
Feel free to take a break. We’ll be here when you get back
😭😭😭😭 Noooooooooooooooo!
I'm going to miss you though I understand that you need this have fun enjoy your life Michael idk if I spelt that right see you in a month
Glad you are taking that break you needed, hope to see you returning soon
Wtf mekealgroft
We support you all the way thank you for all amazing content that has got me through such hard times when I was feeling down. Ps:Grunty boi sexy shower montage every-time doctor quash sponsor
Why
Mikey deserves the rest  The last few weeks have been exhausting for him for sure Especially SV coming out very very soon he needs to take break as it's gonna be a grind to make those videos  By taking a rest he can make better quality vids that usual so its a win-win situation for everyone :)
Damn it the hoodie is a threat to my health
Ppppppppplllllllllleeeeeeeessssssssseeeeeeee don’t go your my favorite
Woo 23m to watch
The video : paid promotion included Me : Gruny bio cometh
u know it's fine but hopefully when you come back you should react to moxie2D's video about his interpretation of the Pokémon you drew. hopefully you come back sooner than later
10:35 There are some of my favorite starters on the blue side, but literally all of my four 3DS playthrough starters are in the red one, so judging by the fact that's the only Nintendo console I've ever had, then I'm on the red side.
This is the thing. 2K likes in 18mins
Sobble is a better name then the pig also the grass gen 9 starter is the best one 3:00 the other ones better that ones ugly like the fire gen 9 starter 3:51 I agree charizard is one of the worst Pokémon in the universe the new profeses suck they not named after trees🤬 I love the axolotl dude who makes the comics❤️ TORTERA BEST ONE🤬 10:15 that’s so desqusting am gonna be sick what monster made that😭😭🤬🤬🤬 10:36 the blue 17:30 EWWWWWWWW INTELION LOOKS 🤮🤮AM SO HAPPY INTELION IS ON TWO LEGS ITS SO COOL AND CUTE
Hopefully we still get scarlet/violet play through whether you do it as soon as it comes out or even later on
Love ya Mikey! Will be waiting for your comeback!!
you deserve a break, mikey! i hope you get the rest and relaxation you need. burnout is serious, and i’ve recently had to do the same sort of extended break to recuperate. take care of your physical and mental self, im rooting for you all the way!
1:59 if it's not 100% accurate, it's 50%
So me personally I started to watch Mikey in the early 2021 before Pokémon day and when I remember January/February of 2021 I remember you and jack so just to let you know I think that the content in 2021 was great
Take as many vacations as you like as long as you come back
Is it Jalamodo or Komoño?
you deserve the rest enjoy it
why?! no! will you be coming back?
I thought he was saddened by the death of technoblade
Resting and recovering to replenish yourself and avoid burnout is always a good thing.  Even the sturdiest Mudsdales need to take some time to breathe.
please bring back Pokemon talk!
I like how Orcane in the fan-drawing is called the Sea Terror which makes sense    Orcas literally is BULLY the entire Ocean Meta. Stingrays get slap into exhaustion and then death. Penguins get hunted by groups of these and killed but they don't eat the penguin. Seals legit have been slap 60 feet into the air to die or knock off ice only for the Orcas to wait for them to get back on to repeat. Sharks face such high levels of PTSD that they will Literally avoid that area for YEARS. Also there have been a case of a group of orcas eating adult blue whales over at Audtralia
So… I got my hair cut for army basic in a couple weeks, and I go from Professor Turo if I grow out my facial hair to Guido Mista before he joined Bucciarati’s gang…
Mikey: Jalamodo Me: Uhhhhhhhhh…
Grunty boi got soap on his hat
I hope you have a good break. We will all wait patiently for your return. Do what you need to do for you
Wish you a good break
R.I.P. Mikey's Eye 😔
Haha where are the gamer goggles
"The Banner is only 33% accurate"  *cough* You mean 50% accurate.
Sorry you gotta go through burnout Mikey, it sucks whenever it happens. I hope you have a good break from YouTube, stay safe ^^
The editor 🥵
hey mikey, i doubt you'll see this, but i hope you know that we'll all stick with you. take as much time as you need, and i hope you feel better soon. we all love ya <3
Ik this'll make me happy again after a certain...... thing.... happened a few days ago.  Also, take as much time as you need, Mikey!
Mikey: Why would anyone eat Lechonk? Me: Thats where it gets its name from. Its a Spanish dish
well.... i'm definitely not straight
Hi
14:54 how about Orcill
Mikey is slowly becoming jack by each video
Not related to memes. But I must ask. Would you ever do a video about how to fix Johto? You did one for XY a year or two ago, and I'd love to see how youd give johto that justice too
Mikey:my eye still stings Me:I TOUCH MY EYE IN A DALY BASIS HECK IF NOT. EVERY Hour!!
When times get tough, these videos help cheer me up. R.I.P Technoblade💔
Hope you feel better after the vacation Mikey! Really appreciate the amount of effort you do to keep posting out consistently so you deserve that rest.
I waited for this video to see my meme but he didn’t show it 😭😭😭😭😭
I love this guy
Mikey pleeeeeessseeeee don’t go your my favorite youtuber
should’ve called the shirt “MandJTSHIRT
Take all the time you need Mikey! We can be patient :)
Not Grunty Boi shampooing his cap-
here before anyone finished the vid
Mikey: So it is only 33% accurate. Me: so it is 50% accurate
10:38 I choose blue
Hey, everyone needs a break every now and again. Enjoy yourself, and we'll be here for when you feel inspired to return!
Nooooo
Take your time, dude.
ur mom
How is there already 342 comments if it is 17 minutes old
Btw mikey, good vacation Don't worry with us, just relax as long as you want ;3
Hi Micheal Love from India♥️🇮🇳
Great video keep them up
Go take a brake rest
Orcane could be name coracane as in coral and orca
So that’s what they mean by „your style hurts my eyes.“
I’ll miss you so much, I’ve never been sadder.
spoink is fine, the dont actually need to constantly bounce its just the get really tired
Did that Fuecoco rice cooker poster not link back to NCHProductions? They did a longer one with a magic rice cooker swapping it's contents as it was opened and closed which was very satisfying
I will bet that mikey will use lechonk on his team
(for the next month) "Mikey's on sabbatical, honey"
mikey, the hoodie looks great. i think that the hood thing was a fluke. i’m gonna miss you, and i’ll be looking foreward to your return. <3
The rivals of Aether comment was me  *realization kicks in* I have been noticed by a god  (With a fabulous beard I will add)  Edit: *looked back at the comments on the video I was one of the few
Mikey: Reviews all the submissions of his improved pokemon concepts:  Meanwhile Moxie2D: *Crying Intensifies*
2:22 Castform: “AM I A JOKE TO YOU?”
tomorow is my birthday
7:48 I feel what that Smeargles going through.
It might need a slight design change but I think Orcanon would work well and the canon is the blow hole
mikey: OH! someone made art of my pokemon! Moxie2D: *cries in un-exposure"
Challenge: make a regular video with your hat facing forwards      (This is a joke)
yayyyy leconk the pokememe
first 20 min baby.
Ahh yes, orwe’llworkonit The powerful orca Pokémon
Honestly I’m surprised that Mikey still calls it as ASPITPIAY and doesn’t automatically call it Pokémon *clap clap* meme review
Is it just me who thought grunty boi would reveal he'd been breaking into some random person's house for the past month when he asked Mikey if he had a new bathroom
Don’t throw you hoodie over you head to fast for safety porous
Ah  yes grunty boi always there when Michael needs to advertise a sponsor
Mikey: 5 drops can kill 50 bouffalaunt  Me: 5 drops can make 50 bouffalaunt FAINT
It isn't pronounced "Arc" phone though, it's pronounced "Arse" phone, proving that is is pronounced "Ar-cee-us.
Technoblade Never Dies
Take as much time as you need!
Mikey: the banner is 33% accurate  Me: so it's not 100% accurate? Therefore...
14:35 hey, that was me!
MEME REVIEWWW
:( Archie and Maxie were more idiotic alr.
No you
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!
Orpain. Rename it Orpain.
Much love to ya, Michael. Take all the time ya need. Been a fan for years and that won't quit any time soon. Be easy, brother.
5:10
Can we just take a minute to pay tribute to the true mascot of the channel grunty boy for the awesome sexy shower Montage let's be honest 30% of this channel belongs to grunty boy.😍😚👏🏽
Feel free to take a break whenever you need
Are coming back with a month and a half axe pizza pie
Day 1 of asking Micheal to do another pokemon type then vs now.
HES DONE IT AGAIN
Fart
Heal well Mikey
Guys he made grungy boi too hot
Mikey I found a random shiny bidoof after I beat Pokemon shining Pearl in starter grass not trying to flex that was my first shiny ill miss your channel for a while
About time we get a new Grunty Boi thirst trap
Hey, it's okay to take a break, everyone gets burned out After some repititive working time. Take how many days you need in your break to make sure you feel better.
Is grunty bois hat part of his BODY??????!!!!!!!!!! when he cleaned his hat with the soap is it his hair??? This is like a jotaro hat hair situations!!!!
Ah yes, new god.
my advice, take a rest, that helps, I think, if you are feeling tired, you should take a vacation
Grunty Boi puts the soap directly on his hat. Is the hat just part of his hair? Can he not take it off?
I appreciate that we have established that  all Mikey needs to denote that he is grunty boi is the hat.
SEXY SHOWER MONTAGE PART 2
Why Mikey with the beard looks like he lost his job and is homeless?
mickey is going to the store to get milk
Take a break Mikey rest well

dang grunty boi looks amazing...wait why are you taking off your clothes? oh thank god its just a sponsorship.
Grunty Boy: “Showers” Me (Eating my Food): WTF my heart
Mikael,The Mikey Pokémon! Type:Normal,YouTuber (Dark). Weaknesses: Hoodies,Funny memes,Mickey. Signature move: Upload (Base dmg:75,Accuracy:100) Has a 101% chance to flinch. Ability:Victory Star „If it’s not 100% Accurate,It’s 50% accurate.” Victory star makes every attack more accurate… in this case,not!

I think him hitting himself with the hoodie was in a script
I really hate it when jackets do that. Good thing I am always wearing my GAMER GOGGLES.
Hello everyone hope you have a great day 👍🏻
After technoblade ur the second most self aware youtuber I know which mentions that he wants subs and views and cause of his death I've been down so your vids are my coping mechanism
The intro is why mikey needs the gamer goggles
