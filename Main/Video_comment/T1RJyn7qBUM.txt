Thank you, WIRED. Always a pleasure :)
"It's completely timeless" - Levy doesn't play bullet chess apparently.
16:28 forward, does Tani do a double move with the rook after Levy hits over the white queen with his black queen? (rook G5 then F5) might be the way it's edited, but it looks like the rook was repositioned on the wrong square.
That little girl is going to take a lot arrogant men’s money at the park 😂
Curious if anyone here has ever played a chess game ending in checkmate with no pieces removed.
If that's a novice then wtf am I??😭
0:59 ahead of his time
Sooooooo the first "novice" girl explained a 3 move check? Yea seems legit :)
TANI IS THE NEXT BIG THING!!!!
Levy are you throwing these?
29:04 Levy's face of pain
Three things: 1. This video came in my feed a long time back, as I was watching some of the '_ expert answers' kind of videos of Wired. I didn't watch this at that time, mainly because I had no idea who this person is. Well, now I know. One of the two best teachers-explainers present on YouTube who'll make a dead soul click on the thumbnail😂❤ 2. I've recently started the 'talking-while-playing' thing (ukwim), and it's really hard, becomes even harder as I've recently, like, started properly playing chess. 3. I am really looking forward to a phase when we've the combination of these super-real conversational AI agents and chess bots of different levels & gameplay style (as mentioned at level 5). Then it'd be really really fun and learning-rich to play with 'bots'.
0:59 67
Completely useless for learning
when the girl starts explaining you see the fiar in levis eyes  xd
Yeah, if she is a novice then I'm a dogshit
Felt attacked when the word "Novice" was put over one of my favorite openings 0:17
Cool. So I'm just a bit worse at chess than a 8 year old girl.
Queens Gambit 2 looks great!
This is such a great video. Bravo to all involved, Levy especially.
Levy is a god tier teacher
Wow, it was 36 minutes, I thought 16
Imagine being asked to explain chess on 5 different levels and losing a game to the 3rd level of person that you're supposed to be explaining chess to.
The novice is WAY too advanced
"The fun thing about numbers representing people..." It's that mass genocide becomes just a fun equation about subtraction.
29:00 you can see the pain in his eyes
levys so beautiful
Too quick camera changes, it is impossible to concentrate
0:58
This escalates too quickly for someone trying learn about the game imo not enough basics at thr start
Oh cool so the novice here is an 8 year old that is probably around 800 elo at least and I'm never going to surpass 500. Sick
Wait, the little girl was a novice?  Bruh, then what am I!?!??
GM Irina Krush plays chess like GO
Seeing levy calm is very...unsettling
Gotham really got a polished forehead for this
Bro the make up is heavy😂 You'd know this if you watch Guess the ELO
Loved the chemistry with Tani! 😊
How tf is half of the comments people saying that a kid with a 900 rating who wants to triple her pawns is "too advanced" 😭
I’m loving this.
0:58 I got shivers when he said that. 67
he is not a pro
Wired putting a woman gm in the video... jez
good posture by the young lady
does levi have makeup on? lol
I’ve never seen Levy speak so kindly as he did with that little 8-year-old. Proof that he really does have a heart.
0:58 6-7
28:31  In the case of Irina, why do you make that gender distinction, 8x US "WOMEN'S" Chess Champion. I thought Chess is gender agnostic.
Yooo... This 8yr old is more than a novice.
25:30 Take rook with queen, they take back with queen Then take other rook with bishop! Up 1 material!
Your channel was one of the reasons I got back into chess again.  So, thank you!  You really make it seem methodical and accessible. :-)
I'm 35 and that girl is probably much smarter than me
Looks like u have concealer on?
I would love this for Go
Levy is really great w kids
this camera angle should be the standart
I love how he does classic Levy moves like sacrifices the rook and plays the Dutch
Chess is Chinese Economy And Americans are Stockfish
Why was level one already a friggin chess prodigy?? Couldn't find more of a beginner to fit that role?
Level one? This is level one? It's a child! You prepped that child, right?
That 8 year old is going to be a GM one day if she keeps playing and practicing
Why is Levy explaining these things to a 1100 elo who has more knowledge than most of us already
That’s NOVICE?!???
That was really interesting. I liked the way you explained the levels. That Tani kid is scary smart.
A rare example of Levy not beating a kid. How wholesome!
16:22  love tje wau thsi lottle bpy went frpm defendong tp attacking the black kind in a couple of moves.
just found this guy and dude seems like a really good dude
Levy is with makeup or he just slept well? He normally looks more vampiric.
4 minutes in and i already can tell Levi is an awesome teacher. The kid was awesome too so that helps but I’m actually so impressed and happy to see this.
This episode was nicely wholesome ❤
The little girl seem to be much better than the intermediate player
Chess is easy. Just trade your bad pieces for their good pieces.
20:42 levy describing his play style me realizing that that is also probably the slowest to a play style i have and irena immediately guessing he’s a kings indian player when thats the only black opening i play 😭
cool all the way up
the 8 year old was AWESOME!
Why is Levi so shining and so nice?
Levy may never be a GM, but only Elizabeth Harmon and Fischer have introduced more people to the game.
I'm definitely stupid
I gave up at novice level
They washed out his face and put too much makeup on poor levy.
its wierd to see Levy being so calm
100-1000 lvl 1  1000 -1800 lvl2  1800-2200 lvl 3 2200-2600 lvl 4 2600+ lvl5
20:26
Levy with foundation is uncanny
Chess is amazing, it's not often one can see a young man chuckle suiting his age, and then suddenly start talking like a veteran who is totally confident and experienced in his domain. Very entertaining video, thank you Wired team!
never heard a human sound so much like the AI version of himself
That's not novice level. A novice can't find checks in 3 or knows the name of the squares.
I clicked in a hope to learn chess better and the 8 yo kid started talking like an alien to me 😭 I'm done
Levy is wearing makeup?
THAT WAS NOVICE?! 😭😭😭 im cooked
Levy you should hire Professor Hikaru as your coach on the road to GM
the  make up is killing me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
OUR BOY LOOKIN FRESH WITH THAT MAKEUP
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME THE EXACT CHESS SET THAT IS USED IN THIS VIDEO
Levy !?!  Wtf?  He isnt even a grandmaster!
I might be stupid, but shouldn’t she do Bd5 to pin his queen? 25:08
the AI stuff at the end is so funny, bro prolly feelin like Oppenheimer rn
did they make him wear makeup
Chess is not "thousands" of years old lol. It is at best 1500 and even then, the pieces were different. Go on the other hand, IS thousands of years old and at least a thousand years older than Chess. And the pieces have never changed, they've always been black and white smooth round stones.
You really should have rendered the live games onto the screen like real chess channels do
White: scholars mate, fried liver, and Italian game Black: Kings Indian defense
Zaro ❤
Wired knows how to light a shot, I've never seen Levy with so much color in his face, what an illusion.
13year old with 2295 elo, that look like a super GM in the making 😂
give your life to Jesus
Does that first girl coach? I could totally use a teacher.
Seeing a 13 year old be better than I'll ever be ruined my day 😭
Novice was already too advanced
Ngl that kid is already better than I am xD
0:30 she forgot about THE ROOOOOOOOOOOOOK!
"Gotham Chess" and "Chess Pro" in the same sentence 😂😂😂😂😂
If that girl is a novice, then what does that make me? I’m a monkey playing checkers I guess lol
Level 1 is for people who have never played chess. Proceeds to say she'd move rook to h8 or something. BRUH.
it's hilarious that the novice is already incredibly good at the game xD
She's a badass and even not knowing that level of chess , but understanding the systems they went through, that was insanely enjoyable. Levi you muthafucker i hope you continue to progress. You deserve everything (she does too i just don't recognize her because i'm really not an enthusiast no matter how good she is.).
they did levi really bad with the concealer, hes better without it
Just got humbled and feeling like a chimp right now.
I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about the AI researcher perspective on the game, but I think working towards a more accurate representation of a lower level human player is a really interesting way to take the next step in computer chess. Currently, a bot at "1200" is just programmed to make X number of mistakes or play the 4th best option in a position instead of the 1st in order to play more like the same level of human. If you can make the decisions more accurate and more realistic to a human's reaction to a position, that would make the training so much more effective...
The more correct word is synergy not harmony.
11:32 musi
Love how yall found the only female grandmaster out of 2000 men to fit your narrative. Good on you lmao
anybody else notice how similar the game he played against the FIDE master and the position he went over with the intermediate player were
Levy be doing anything but becoming a GM
Explains ❌  Interviews✔
I am a minute and half in, is she the level one, geez, why do I still play chess
So good
Girls and boys don't play together? Why? They can't shower together after match?
Is it just me, or the higher the FIDE rank, the more intimidating they are. Just an aura of “I’m in control”
Why does Levy's hand disappear when he raises it up? Are they on a green screen? Doesn't really seem like it. Odd. Pieces on the board are also moving between cuts. Also odd.
Wired have definitely made Levy wear makeup right?
This little girl as an 8 year old probably has a better over the board rating than most people watching this video.
Can anybody tell how's the queen not hung at 23:23 of white? After taking the white knight with the black knight with a discovered check???
I made $1,400 in my second month. Yes, beginners should also focus on one trading strategy at a time.
You have it here first guys. YouTube not gonna cut it against real life professionals.
Why did this series stop?
bro his face is so ai
the kid girl is more than the intermediete guy
Thank u
Plot twist novice comes at the end.
She is in my chess group bro I swear the level 1
nice
Very clear to me that the young "novice" would wipe the board with me. 🤣 I really enjoyed the conversational aspect of the game with Irina (the grandmaster). Just hearing what the players are thinking as they evaluate the position and the potential moves and counter-moves is really valuable.
Chess is hard. But i am starting to get a hang of it
please more 5levels videos
Is it a problem if i know the tactics by moves and not names
I'd love to see more of this kind of discussion between two people discussing the game after
I'm pretty sure the girl representing the novice level would crush me in a game
"Let's try not to end the game right away" "Very fun..." Burn...
4:02 a what now?? Hate to brake it but I feel like were past the novice part 😂
Levy in teacher mode is so cuuute
18:15 ISLE OF MAN MENTIONED!! 🇮🇲🇮🇲🇮🇲
"in the middle game trades are either good or bad for you or your opponent." thank you for the completely neutral advice
that 8 year old is WAY better at chess than me guaranteed lmao
You know they deliberately made sure there were no white boys in the group .
25:29 Can´t see it... why not just take the black rook with the bishop?
Computers may not "feel" confidence but they can measure it in the statistical sense. Whether or not AI feels depends a lot on what the word even means and that's something that philophers still debate.
It would be great if when you showed the board, you showed it for longer so we could analyse it ourselves, and at a minimum have time to hit "pause". thanks!
What a gentleman that young fidemaster was
The 8-year-old level was still light-years above what I will ever know about chess.
How is nobody mentioning how beautiful that GM was??
If that kid is level 1, I'm level 0.3
That chess tutorials theat walk you through a middle game and that, would love to see a good course, Any Recommendations?
They could’ve gotten an actual pro to shine on the people who are competing
Very weird video and way too dumbed down  realistically it should be  Beginner (≤ 800 Elo) – Knows the basic rules but struggles with strategy, blunders frequently. Novice (800-1000 Elo) – Can play complete games, recognizes some tactics but lacks consistency. Apprentice (1000-1200 Elo) – Understands openings, tactics, and basic endgames but still makes many errors. Intermediate (1200-1600 Elo) – Solid tactical awareness, starts grasping positional play, and can calculate a few moves ahead. Advanced (1600-2000 Elo) – Strong club player, knows strategy, openings, and endgames well, makes fewer mistakes. Expert (IM) (2000-2400 Elo) – High-level competitive player, deep understanding of chess, title-worthy (Candidate Master to International Master). Master (GM) (2400-2800 Elo) – Grandmaster-level, world-class tournament player, deep theoretical and practical mastery of chess. Artificial Intelligence (2800+ Elo) – Superhuman level, capable of beating the strongest human players, typically played by engines like Stockfish and AlphaZero.
I had to playback level 3 on slow mo because I was like huh. But i paused and go me? for at least understanding haha.
LiL bros confidence, I'd  be so nervous playing Levy!   You blundered the rooooook 😂
Chess and computers have come full circle. We're now thinking, how would a human play? 😅
Raw, next question
that little girl would smoke me in chess, I'm 32 😂
8:22 If I was black 💀💀
I've been playing chess for 40+ years and watching this video one thing is very clear,  that the first young girl is way ahead of me and I'm not even novice level 😮
so was the kid at the beginning the expert?  im confused lele
Do you have the dumb level? Cuz apparently I'm not a beginner 😂
why the make up its uncanny af sorry plz no make up next time, for me pretty plz, i luv u levy if u see this <3
WHY DID WIRED STOP THIS
wired thought they‘d just use a young kid as the „novice“ but forgot that this video is about chess 💀
This is a good video, But was that Levy Explaining?!
So much makeup
yall did my mans makeup CRAAAZY  he looks like jared leto joker
The GM: "OK, I'm going to slowly choke this streamer guy", hahaha
Hikaru be like i adopted him
Loved the video, but the title is very misleading. I'm not sure how an IM "explains" the game to a GM...
To me the 8yo is a master
This is so legit thank you!
I think the kid giving levy a draw says a lot more than if he had grabbed the mate
🥰
No way Levy's doing to this
I really wished Levy would talk to me like how Levy talks to the little girl. He is very patient and soft tone with her, which is really nice.
I'm a bit surprised that a world champion doesn't seem to know what the Leningrad Dutch is.
So they lied to us. The little girl at the beginning was the actual Grandmaster 😂😅😂
Hes doing it for the love of the game.......and his under eye make up
Tani for the win
why do they look like dolls
The 8 year old is not the beginner I was expecting to see. She has obviously already learned a lot.  I expected to see someone who at most only knows how each piece moves. That would be the proper beginner.
Chess is deaf  people game  If you don’t the game . How to play chess
I barely know the rules of chess, I was absorbed by this video
I love that levy was clearly surprised by how precocious the child is.
I really like seeing this side of Levy. It definitely lets you know what a wonderful teacher he must have been before he got famous.
lol when you know less about chess than an 8 year old
Levy is the teacher we would all love having.
I learned chess for a week at church camp and the coach said something that will forever stick in my brain, “10^120, the numbers of distinct moves in a chess game is vastly larger than the known observable atoms in the universe.” Since he said that at age 13, (I’m now 25! Only winning a few casual games, I’m the opponent that people love practicing with because I don’t play to win, I casually play for fun and my husband is enamored on how I can do a basic game of chess. ❤  I truly miss having someone to have a casual fun game with.
I have a Krush on Irina
In the GM game, after Levy played b6 threatening white's Queen, the GM played Qc3. I felt Qd4 would've been more precise to keep the threat of Bd5 in tact. This would force the Bishop for Rook exchange since Black cannot defend against the threat of Bd5 while also moving aside the Rook on a8.   Did I miss something? My FIDE ~2000 just for reference.
Well, let's just say, She Krush Levy in chess 😁
Gotham a chess pro? Lol
Lost me at novice level. Explain it to me like I have the mental capacity of a golden retriver and then maybe, just maybe I'd be able to pick up the pieces...
The novice in this video is better at chess than I'll ever be :')
This would be helpful but even that little kid would smoke my dumb*ss
This isn’t checkers felt targeted 💀💀💀
Gotta hand it to Tani, that was impressive. A close and exciting blitz.
ngl in the decription, i read "a novice, an intermediate, a semi-pro, a grandmother, and an AI programmer", and was sadly disappointed
...
Nah, Levy. We not letting it slide, bruh. You wearing makeup in this 😂
That novice girl knew waaaay more than me -- what's a level below novice?
6:36 Is it right to say “also” instead of “too”?  I thought it’s a common mistake for not native speakers. But hearing Hikaru and Gotham saying that - I’m a little confused. 😵‍💫
If that little girl is a novice then I don’t want to know what I’m considered cuz she definitely knows more about chess than I do
Why isn't bishop takes rook at the 25:00 mark not an automatic? I'm a big dummy asking the internet pros for help.
That kid probably have a potential to be a gm lol
Was he aware when he agreed to this that Magnus wouldn't be in the thumbnail?
Hmm..  never seen levi with makeup before🤔
A future GM! More hype than a GM.
why doesn't he teach us like this?
That 8 year old was NOT a novice 😭
Watching the Grand Master play, and I need to argue against something that was said earlier in the video.  Chess is indeed an art, it's a living art, like a live band playing music.  You can't hang it up on the wall, you enjoy it as it's happening.
Thomas Sharon Taylor Kimberly Jones Charles
using dark black is not a good idea when you're trying to show people how to play the game. it's hard to see which one is which.
The eight year old being described as a "novice" makes me think my elo should be negative
Camera switches during the game were quite distracting
Day 2 of asking WIRED to do “5 levels on Go/Baduk board game” ⚪️⚫️
For novice: YOu have to trap the king For experts: Arrange adjacent to the acuity according to a redundancy avaidalbe through modification in the concept
Novice: “A skewer.” Me newer than novice: “What???”
Day 1 of asking WIRED to do “5 levels on Go/Baduk board game” ⚪️⚫️
Nice makeup u put on levy
Is levy wearing makeup
there should be an episode about wine. Beginner enjoyer up to Master Somm
This was great but I wish you could just see the board without all the cuts and jumps during the play. Would really help for focusing on the game. Even if it was just smaller over the larger frame of the players.
This little girl is not a level 1 chess player.....if she can spot one side is winning despite being down 2 in endgame - she's an experienced player!  I am honestly blown away by her level at that age, especially if no chess-nut parent / mentor / friend taught her.
Levy with make up looks so cursed
I want to see a philosopher explain something in 5 levels, like phenomenology or Descartes' cogito
Great video!. Congrats.  Help me a lot
Levy with make up is a nightmare fuel
@14:23  bro, you ARE black lollll
Stucked on 100 elo
Levy is awesome! Love his enthusiasm.
Stick with IM Levy. It's all good
Well  Now i understand vitamin D deficiency is a thing😂😂😂
AI Programmer ist cheatcode 😂
29:00 stub in the heart........................Fire up my mannnnnnn
What a great video! As someone in my first year of chess it's great to hear different views. I think Irina should write a book on her journey, it was lovely the way she spoke about it.
The title clearly says "Chess Pro" but all I see is Levy.
❤
You had three outstanding personalities to explore. Fantastic content. Thank you.
When will he become a Grand Mother?
that 8 year old girl at the beginning is going to be a grandmaster one day....totally amazing....
@25:30 - why not white Bxa8?
17:38 who won and why? :/
great video
Irina Krush is a babe.
Dang they got him caked in make up.
So the girl who saw checkmate in 3 moves was the beginner, got it. 😮
Levy looking zesty
Wow, really impressed by how good of a teacher Levy is. I'm a total rookie and I understood everything he was explaining. He does a wonderful making deep conceps really easy to grasp.
That 8 year old would totally kick my butt in chess.
They brought the ultimate chess milker to milk him
I have a 5 year old mentality. So, I love Levy 👍😊
25:17 bishop g2-a8 ??????
17:30 broo..
I don't understand, who is explaining what? It's not Gotham explaining but the people with him????
thats not a chess pro.
Can someone explain why the FIDE master put rook on h1?
Always puts a smile on my face to see Tani!
Thankgod he didn't say "no thats not the move you bozo"
Bro has so much makeup on 💀
wtf happened to levys eyes
When does the Chess Pro come on screen?
Levy is incredibly well spoken
That is not a novice LMAO
I hate these fake explanation videos.  the 1st 4 "levels" are already well versed in the subject and know more than the average person.
Holy crap that first little girl was the beginning of the scale???
Level 1: young child who’s leagues smarter than me 😢
Ok, i give him a throphy for behing the nicest human on youtube
how wld u explain it to magnus?
He is not a chess pro, he is not a Grand Master.   In other words, his chess abilities is equal to the tennis abilities of a player that cannot even qualify for Wimbledon or US Open.
Levy received a face lifting. Fascinating.
25:33 isnt Blacks rook on a8 hanging?
Apparently i"m at the level of an 8 year old kid. Even her outfit rocks better then any of my outfits.
The makeup actually suits Levy pretty well. He looks more tired but more sane :D
She's not at the highest level. She may be a GM, but she's a GM woman. Women require a lower elo to be considered GM. Notice how they didn't show her elo in her name card. She's probably lower than Levy.
This 8 year old is not representative of a novice
levy looks like he just bleached his entire face something about it is off its like a really  bad impersonation of him like a wax statue
would like more social science scholars on this series
Lovely to see Levy sacrifice a rook without screaming his head off.
The last guy is exited to create demons.
LEVY IS A GREAT TEACHER WHAT
ouuu this is interesting
Levy has worked with kids before, it's really showing in the first section. Great stuff.
Levy is not a chess pro, he is great at chess but not a pro. I pull up this month's FIDE ranking and if you are top 100 then you are a pro.
I’m sorry that kid is no novice what is this
20:06 bro chill
How is levy supposed to explain chess at the GM level if he is not a GM?
levy wearing makeup?
0:28 She forgot . . . THE ROOOOOOOK
I appreciated Levy's conversation with the AI programmer, but I also felt it was a little insulting to Irina Krush to place the AI programmer "above" the grandmaster.
Levy never Fails to Look like a Twink in Wired videos
Why is Levy's skin so smooth in this video
Wow they actually found a female grandmaster
I just kept waiting for Levy to go off on the kid when she made a move like how he gets on stream. Lol
Guess its time for Levy to retire and do horse racing :)
Is there a level before the first girl I can get a lesson on? We are going to need more basic for the cheap seats.
Irina here exudes so much humility warm, light and friendly aura.This is what happen when ingenuity meets character and humility.
Man hikaru would have been be soo good here instead
i used to thought im intermediate player, now i realised I'm totally below beginner😭
Levy won’t play over the board anymore?
honestly novice was way to complicated  for me XD
@29:00 maybe she is the reason for Levys journey to GM 🤔@29:26 😂
14:45 that's the Chess equivalent to leaning towards the screen when you enter gamer concentration mode
2:03 that is NOT a novice. Doesn't matter how hard you try to convince me otherwise, that kid has been playing and studying chess for a LONG WHILE.
леви же он сам im как он собирается gm обяснять что то. Хз можно ли его называть chess pro. Наверное хотя бы 2600 нужно было позвать. У леви и то im было если не ошибаюсь щас даже меньше
Let's be honest. Levy isn't capable to explain past level 2
"Novice" 😂
That 8 year old would wipe me off the board lmao
I like how they chose for this video an 8yo who already knows how to use technical terms to describe moves, evaluate positions, and discuss tactics 😶😂
I'm not sure what I'm more surprised by: the fact that Levy was beaten by a girl or that one is a Grandmaster. So cool!
Waaaaay too much makeup on Levi yall
Levy looks so weird with all the make up 😂
That kid probably knows more than me
Bro that girl is far beyond than me 😂
Levy with an 8 year old:SoPhIsTiCaTiOn Levy with his audience:DA ROOK
There's nothing more terrifying than hearing Gotham Chess say "we're gonna look up your account, we're gonna pick a random game, and we're gonna analyse it" after his entire guess the elo series
Live chess ♟️
Why do all of them look ai generated
Not a chess pro but ok
life is brilliant. Life is beautiful, that it has become to the point of obsession. some chase their dreams, though they are but a mind and flesh. some  but just a head. some do for love, no matter how elusive. Lord of light banish the dark, humanity has prospect a form of mere. but A LIE WILL REMAIN A LIEEE. young hollow, knowing this, have you still desired peace?
I mean.. on grandmaster its already way past levy lmao.. 💀
Wow.....amazing to see his journey over the years to becoming an excellent teacher!
Seeing Levy with makeup on took me by surprise.
Ain’t no way a 8 year old knows better than me and I’m 11,  how is that considered a novice?
In chess novice >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Noob
MAKEUP
It's like Elijah Wood and Daniel Radcliff banged and created an even bigger nerd.
Is that the Got ham
Fantastic!
8 year old Novice was not good for this content. But she was good at chess!
Why levy looking like james charles
How is that lvl 1 😂😂😂
beginner was definitely not one. She was talking strategies.
Expected Levy to go "Yeah that's a great plan, you're thinking you can just move your queen, your rook, oh hello, King's by himself checkmate, right? That's totally winning unless THE ROOK! BRILLIANT MOVE!!"
So sad no one can pronounce FIANCHETTO correctly
Good discussion on the AI developments. Obviously the ship has sailed on humans being proud of being 'better' then a computer at chess.  Now it should be all about helping to make individual humans get better at chess in a meaningful and realistic way.  Rather then worrying about beating a number-crunching machine that has been artificially handicapped, it may be better to play a variety of character-driven 'AI's' that have their various styles, preferences, techniques, weaknesses and strengths. That can help you prepare for the real thing.
Would love to see a 5 levels on something in the economics realm.
Novice.. broooo
ARE YOU WEARING FOOKING MAKEUP LEVI ? You sellout
Wait!!! the Kid won right?
That kid would totally destroy me in chess -_-
I know it's blitz, but the Dutch against a GM? Come on Levy. Give us a real game
Excellent range of players. I especially liked Irina's perspective. Space, time, and harmony. Wow.
Levy is the man
The editing constantly cuting out of the board is relay anoying
I thought level 5 was gonna just be “Magnus”.
I will nevel have level
Levy got makeup on 🤡
Intermediate to FIDE master is quite a gap which covered by handful of individuals
Kids in normal episodes of explained in 5 levels:  🤡 Meanwhile in chess: 💀
Bro is NOT a chess pro💀  Could've brought garry or hikaru mabye magnus but that's overkill
Pro? I thought your retired xD
Why did they have to do him dirty with that make-up?
When did Levy become a Chess Pro?
If I was watched this without knowing anything about chess, I would still know close to nothing about chess.
every time I hear "fiancetto" my italian brain dies. Amazing video, super fun to watch not only theory but also practical game, thank you!
I lasted a minute and a half before I got lost. Good luck everyone
I like how everyone is going on about tactics and initiative and strategy, and Irina is over here going "That move is too boring."
There’s like so many GMs you could’ve gotten lmao, the world runs on connections
dude why is this 8 year old girl very clearly better at chess than me
I'M not saying anything
very interesting, Levy
Lol dude starts at like level 2 for level 1.
the 8 yr old is smart and the fide kid was like an adult
"Chess pro" and got gothamchess. And "pro"? This ain't a vedio game blud
Shut him up
very unprofessional title. chess pro is not a word. You can say a chess master but not chess pro
29:17 I think this really influenced levy
i enjoy Levy's YouTubes generally, have purchased one of his courses, but I really like this Levy far more than other the more brash YouTube or course personna.  I learned more here in a few minutes than much longer presentations where he talks so fast I can't keep up.  Please give us more presentations like this one. And I agree with other comments; an on screen board would be great.  Thanks Levy.
I play with players who take a huge amount of time to move, what do you think of this?
Lol, the novice explanation is still above my head.
That conversation with the AI programmer was super interesting, really enjoyed hearing his input on what artificial intelligence means to chess now and in the future  :)
why is the top an AI expert and not a chess super grandmaster?
The little girl explained Chess in a  better and more succinct way than Levy 😂
Novice a person who is not experienced in a job or situation: "I've never driven a car before - I'm a complete novice"
Smooth looking Levy Rozman is oddly unsettling
What's the point of explaining chess to people who play chess? Training? lol.
that 8 year old is probably better than me!
The first things out of the grandmaster's mouth are concepts well known to magic players. That's fun. Harmony, Time, Space. Tempo, board control and synergy are each factors you can apply to your deck and playstyle and have been oddly well studied if you're curious
He is the missing link between Daniel Radcliffe and Elijah Wood
BTW Tani is now 2351 nearly an IM, the kid will definitely be a grandmaster in the next couple of years
I was ready to zone out half of the video until the more advanced explanations, but the 8yo one was already interesting lol
LEVY LOOKS SO DIFFERENT W MAKEUP WTF
Does Levy look strange to anyone else here lol? Like are his eyebrows different or something?
when Irina said"29!" Levy all of sudden saw HOPE!
Man I wish my parents would have shown me chess as a child. It's just impossible to get to a high level if you didn't start playing very young.
levy now has an opening bot for his courses go check it out
I mean, expert?  He's barely an IM
Levels of Chess is actually a tricky subject when trying to correlate it with ELO ratings. This is because a human player with ELO of 2000 doesn't exactly play like a 2000-rated computer. Computers usually make moves that are consistent to their configured ELO rating. Whereas amateurs make book/good moves in some moves, then play badly/like a beginner in other moves especially during the middlegame and endgame phase. Same can be said for tournament players. At the start of the tournament, they start really well during the first few rounds, tend to play poorly during the middle rounds and then probably bounce back on the last round when there are prizes or awards at stake. And the metric of this kind of behavior is measured in terms of the so-called Tournament Performance Rating (TPR). This means that while a computer's playing strength is defined by the parameters set to them, the playing strength of humans is defined by the average of their physical and mental performance at any given time.
No way that kid was a novice/beginner. Maybe if you're rating by professional standards but I would say at least amateur and that's being generous. Probably intermediate.
why Levy's makeup look like that
I seriously can never tell if I'm just crazy, or if you guys do this in all your videos.... Do you find people that are WAY SMARTER than novice on purpose? This girl just explained chess in a brilliant way. A novice to chess would describe what the shapes of the pieces look like, what they think they might do, etc. Seriously who is writing this, and why did you treat the position of this person like it's an 'Honor' to receive, so some group of people eagerly sent their amicable, precocious, young protege who is 'novice' by some archaic notion to be explained to on youtube to 1.4 million viewers 'the basics' of chess? Please, show your videos teaching real people how to do the thing that they really want to learn to do. that would be SO much more interesting. this is awesome I'm sure, and this girl seems great. But why is a chess pro explaining chess to her? is this a master class? 'cause that's cool. But that's different. nuh uh. No thanks, I feel like this has already happened in some of your other videos too. I think it's hard to approach borders of topics without knowing what lies adjacent, but I am sure there is an effective and ethical way to find people that are actually right for this format. This girl should obviously be 'intermediate', with all due respect. stopped watching at 0:59, or just shortly before.
Levy in makeup? :D Never knew I need to see! Were are your baggy eyes? :D
Its fascinating how Daniil Medvedev manages to keep up with both tennis AND chess
I want to see one about economist speaking in 5 levels
Such a great video! I'm a decent advanced player and used to coach, now I make chess youtube videos lol
They put make-up on my boy levy , how dare they
Trap the king and attack it at the same time. Never thought of it that way. Smart kid right there.
Well done episode!
If she's a novice I am a literal fetus.
Great series, Levy. Thank you.
Do one about language
Fire the makeup man
Great vid for the most part hit the 8 year old definitely wasn’t novice level which i feel like defeats the point of this particular video format
Levy is such a g
I don't know how to say this respectfully, but it is meant with MUCH respect as Irina is an absolute BOSS. But she is incredibly hot. I can't pinpoint why. But just an absolute smokeshow.
28:58 She said 29 at exactly 29...  Then went on to make levy die a little inside.
GM Judit Polgar is the only player on this list who never became women’s world champion, but with good reason: she never tried to obtain that title. She was simply too strong of a player and was better-suited in open events. She has won games against GMs Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen, both while they were #1 in the world. Polgar has even toppled GM Bobby Fischer: When Polgar earned the grandmaster title in 1991, she was the youngest ever, beating Fischer’s record. (Fischer would stay at the Polgar household for a time in 1993.)  By the time Polgar was 21 years old, New York Times chess columnist GM Robert Byrne declared, “there is no argument about the greatest female player ever." Her position was certainly inarguable by the objective rating: in January 1989, when Polgar was 12, she already ranked 55th in the world at 2555, just shy of Chiburdanidze's peak. By July 1993, Polgar reached a 2635 rating and joined the world top 20, easily surpassing Chiburdanidze’s top marks. On FIDE’s January 1996 rating list, Polgar ranked 10th, a previously unimaginable accomplishment.
Why did she not take rook with bishop at 47 seconds?  Am I missing something?
"you should think for like 47 more seconds, then move" "a'ight, bet"
Levy is not bright enough to be making this type of videos...
Why’s Levy wearing make up?
The camera should have focused on the board during the gamephase if not for the whole video. But no critic beside that.
The “novice” is smarter than I am so that feels good
wtf that 8 year old has more knowledge than me and im 32 lol
Deeper you get into chess, the more annoying and boring it becomes. Let's not forget, it's just a board game.
If that girl is a beginner, I need to rethink my abilities.
Level 1 here is way higher than level 1 when i was in elementary school.
19:10 I think a great example of that "harmony" she mentions is just thinking of niche cases. You could only have 3-4 pieces left against a dozen, but you win because they're positioned perfectly to checkmate. You don't have the space, but your pieces are working together for that checkmate... and their pieces aren't/weren't working together well enough to defend.
Levy makes fun of Martin, yet he himself is a wholesome Martin in real life 😅
i reaaaallly don't like the way the level 4 grandmaster views chess and how she explains it. It is NOT about controlling squares. That is just too elementary. It is about planning, critical thinking, speed, and most importantly tactics and stradegy. Yes there is a difference. Tactics can be explained basically as a combo, or a move that is followed by a forced series of another move or moves. stradegy is your playstyle, how you want the game to go. For instance, are you playing for a draw? are you playing to survive or to crush. Are you playing to checkmate early or to outplay in an end game.
Very interesting.
TIL I’m worse than that smart 8 year old.
14:23 "if I was black..." 👀My boy don't see colour, nobody tell him
Level 3 is already 2300 ELO ???   Yikes!
There's a 0% chance that 8 year old was a Novice level
I think I saw Levy's soul get crushed when Irina said, "Most people, if they don't do it by the time they're like 20, they'll probably never do it."
hey, dont write "chess pro". very unprofessional. Write chess master instead
Chess is a dangerous game. They might say, the most dangerous game. On the way to being great musician in making, scholar, artist, writer, humanitarian? Watch out.
had 1200 elo then stopped playing for half a year and lost every game. Thats when i knew i had to quit
Excellent play and discussion by everyone in this video.  The idea of "harmony" is new to me, but makes so much sense.  I'm not a super advanced player, but I feel like in the majority of games I win there's a general feeling throughout the game of ideas flowing more naturally, and majority of games I lose there's more a feeling of confusion and trying to react to unexpected things.  Of course there are plenty of blunders but in general there is a feeling of being more in harmony, more of a smooth development in games that go well.
What is the first player? Ryina  is that a setup?
Love this guy! Great video!
funny how the lvl 3 unit beat the host
the 8 year old was not a beginner.  she is better then I am...
8 Year Old "Beginner" says "Queen to h4"  explains terms i have never heard. I'm 27. Something needs to change, starting with the catagory terms 💀
Cool to know that this 8 year old 10 times the chess player ill ever be
If that was a novice then I’m playing very wrong
Even the level 1 kid could beat me - awesome video!
I was so tired when I watched this at 3am that I thought it said “Chess Bro”
Thank you
You don't bring an 8 year old that can sit down with a half done chess board and come up with a three move checkmate plan in like 2 seconds
Queen is kinda op and broken, they haven't nerfd or patched her for like ever
Good idea to train a neural net with zero search -- based purely on memory.  Maybe Maya does that on its maximum level.
Gotta be kidding me.  "Novice" sounds pretty advance.
Why is there such a drive to make AI behave like humans? At that point, what makes us any different? Disturbing trend.
Maybe this comes later but: on 3:46 cant white play bf3 threatening rh1 mate so black has to take, white recaptures with a pawn, same threat, unstoppable mate? Correct me if im wrong pls :)
Its nice and all but why does Levy's face look so white and AI generated
But the most important question: Why the horsey move so crazy?
thankyou Wired, now show levy rage compilation
That girl was definitely a better player than the intermediate
So the level 1 kid is someone who knew what a skewer was and knew chess notation. This video would have been better if you had a REAL beginner. Not a kid who clearly gets chess coaching.
The amount of make up on Levy's face man
naaaah they made levy turn into james charles lmaooooooooooooo
I stopped watching when little girl started saying rock to c4 and all that lolol
Why does levy look like he owns an onlyfans account
🥱🥱🥱
Teaching the difference between a closed and open position is not Beginner level chess.  The 8-year is pretty advanced, and that discussion is already too advanced for these 5 levels of discussion videos.
I love how everyone who dogs on Levys fans is a fan of him too
Can someone explain why she didn’t fork at 25:11? Or at least take his rook?
FU @Youtube for autoplay
rare instance of Levies fans not being braindead with a combined IQ and ELO of 4
levy has had his make-up done =)
Gothem chess is loooooooser why he is in here United Snakes is Jokeland  😂😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone else totally lost at the beginning
I love Gotham, but watching them both struggle to touch the floor is killing me rn😂 ❤ Also buy his book, it’s the best book I’ve seen for chess newcomers🎉
Really enjoyed watching the Fide Master level game, I'm completely new but was able to follow almost all of what was happening and why cos you were talking about all of the moves and how you felt making them! Appreciate this vid! 🤗
that 1st kid is no begginer
Did the GM miss Bd5 at 25:17?
25:24 if she played d5 she would have forked the Rook and Queen
13:27 can we talk about the little man and how mature he's becoming
I like how Levy explains chess to an 8 year old in a more sophisticated way than he does to his viewers.
To Siddhartha:  if we start combing language processing with spatial interaction and change, then we may start moving toward true sentience.   at this time, an NLP cannot understand what it is saying because it has no experiential reference to attach those words to.  it is pattern processing.  once you pair language processing with action and an awareness of something in space and time, we have a recipe to create real intelligence
I might just be going a little schizo, but is Levy wearing some makeup in this vid? He looks different than he does in his videos. Especially around the eyes.
there's a separate title for "womens" chess?
how can you hate on Levy
love this
25:20 I'm like screaming Qd5!.... And then Levy sac's.
Ageless? Did you mean timeless? I like gothic but chess is a terrible game. As b fischer says its a memorization game at this point. Also, its about dominating others. And it causes people to resuce others to pieces on a board.
Levy without bags under his eyes is different ahahah that being said… love you Levy 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
Levy is not the best player out there but he is, one of the if not, the best teachers out there.
Levyyyyy!!!
Now go watch his video where he curses on russian for 3 minutes >:]
bro that is not a normal 11 year old
Such a solid episode. Levy at his very best. More of this style. Super useful to me, a ~800 and passionate about moving my game up.
how is that little girl level 1 omg am I level -100?
I was expecting the novice to be more um…novicier?
As someone who specializes in chess this being the first video of the Wired series makes me less optimistic about what's to come.   That's because this video had very little to do with explaining chess.  It was more of a meandering and philosophical conversation with some playing around on the board.  I hope the explanational value improves.
Losing to a little kid and still posting the video requires lots of guts so I'll give you props for that.
THE ROOOOOOOOOOOOOKKKKK
Amazing. The final section about AI is just amazing. Humans built AI, now we use AI to make humans better & that's really a beautiful idea.
Oh that’s “novice” level? I’m less equipped than I thought!
I loved the Irina part. She's just gained a new fan. Her way of laughing and talking about chess is just refreshing.
This guy just keeps letting them win... like DUUUDE 😅🥲🤲🏾
Levy looks like a robot here, he's face looks way to perfect
Romantic chess players like the GM lady have always been weird to me. All i see in chess is raw computing power, extensive studies and experience. I still find beauty in the structure and overall technial experience, but to interpret it romantically.. i'm just not the right person for that. I'm glad people are diverse.
First girl - so adorable!
SACRIFICE THE ROOK
That kid, would destroy me lol
i cant believe levy could be that calm when playing chess
I don't have a chess brain, I was blessed with a Twister body.
Maybe get an actual novice for level 1 next time. It would be nice for the millions of us who casually play for fun, but who would get absolutely smoked by that girl.  HINT: if the player has a USCF RATING (like this girl) they are probably not a novice. Perhaps they are a novice compared to other USCF players, but not compared to the majority of casual players out there who might play with an uncle or a daughter or a friend but who would never find themselves at a USCF tournament, or even know what that acronym stands for!  Is it that hard to find a chess novice? Someone who casually plays,  but never competed in an official ranked event?  Someone who knows the very basics of the game but perhaps is new to tactics or strategy... like 90% of the kids I play with?  The people who made this video (and many of the commentors) seem out of touch with what novice chess looks like.  Unlike the 5-levels-of-difficulty explainer videos about things like gravity or multiple dimensions, this chess video never explains at a novice level. I wish it had.
He doesn’t even Compete Professionally. 🤦🏻‍♂️
The cruelest part of a game with Irina was when she gave him hope, that he could reach GM
That novice was no novice!
Can we have lower than novice? She was too advanced.
the 8 year old is smarter than me bro
He sacrificed THE ROOK
So, THAT'S the Novice???????
I would get absolutely rekt by the 'novice'.
I'm not sure why I sat through this entire video.. because I can't even tell the difference between the king and queen most of the time.. but I did find it fascinating.
The 8 year old could teach me
Levy is a great ambassador of chess 🙏
Why do we want machines being able to act just like humans?
Great vid
I'm pretty sure that 8-year-old is better at chess than me.
Yeah, I have the sneaking suspicion that little girl would absolutely destroy me in like 20 moves! LOL
Why did I totally expect to see Magnus Carlsen at some point in the video?
adorable kid
It's all memorization. If someone with a truly photographic memory  studied past games they would be unbeatable, the problem becomes is the game is thousands of years old... while I love chess I have to admit it's an extremely toxic community and that's been my biggest issue with the game. People who are very good (Magnus) think chess is all there is to life and what they don't realize is that in THE REAL WORLD chess matters very little and knowing chess will not save you when life decides to put you in check.
Wtf Levy is great with kids
Just gotta say: that little girl "novice" knew more about chess than I did when I was a 1500 novice.
Wow that WGM is cute
So is she some kind of secret genius or what?
Very Nice!
wtf is this AI looking gotham
If that girl is a novice then I'm a newborn baby.
I feel like he is lowkey 5 foot 4
Beautiful video!
This is exactly the type of AI creation I'm interested in. not just creating the most efficient AI, but decision-based. Including human-like behavior, but certainly not limited to that. As for chess I've only become interested in it a few days ago, haha. I was familiar with the basic moves, though I didn't know about castling and pawns being able to backtake, or however it's called. Nor did I know that you can choose what your pawn becomes when it reaches the other side, I just thought you are then given a queen. So far it's been super interesting to learn more about chess and basic tactics!
That 8 year old kid is smart! Definitely gonna teach my niece this game.
This is great, but the 8 year old is a bit too advanced to be a novice for this series. 2:58 I feel like a better representation of a novice would be the type who says black is winning because they have more pieces.
Didn't expect this video to turn into an intense round-robin slugfest
Where is Anna, to do this episode?
The format of this video makes for engaging, natural, thought-provoking discussion.  I will watch it multiple times.  Thank you for this.
😂😂😂 4:59 is definitely me wtf is next
He was beaten nice!
16:45 Blitz in a nutshell: -Check! -Wait, what!
That little girl knows more about chest than I've ever known
If that's considered a novice player then I should quit.
Ugh.
Agh I hate black and white pieces on black and white squares 😭
17:20 Why didn't Levy take the rook with his king?
I love that Tani played the Reti.
Id love to see levy become a GM dude
God bless ❤ Through Jesus we are saved
''The 8 year old girl understands the game'' Gotham : Now get out of here
The title makes no sense 😂 Levy lost to the 8 year old. He is no GM too.
Bro loses to kid fidemaster nice😂
Bro if that little girl is a novice... then I'm pure GARBAGE!
Is he wearing foundation
Nice video!
Are the style vectors hyper dimensional vectors? I would guess there are some cool vector operations that can be done to see similarity between styles and what would happen by combining styles or w/e
Idk if I would call Levy a chess pro. I'm guessing all the real players were busy
Is this the one of the rare videos this guy doesnt blow my ears out with random baby noises and russian? God i hate that so much.
I don't know if it's just me but I feel the "novice" kid was a stronger player than the "intermediate" guy. No way to know for sure without seeing them play a game, of course, but that's just the impression I got.
Really enjoyed this!
Change the physical board colour to Green. Board's black squares mix with the black pieces and limit visibility of the position.  Surprised that neither Levy nor Wired noticed this 😅
The top players in the world are 400-500 points higher rated than this guy. Next time bring in a real chess pro.
I hate how the Queen's Gambit has infected everyone and victimized everyone to playing Chess, but then when they go to play, they fail and fail and fail, and eventually give up, OR they don't give up because their infectious fantasy is so strong and overall, these victims just wanna feel cool and the glee that Beth Harmon did in the Queen's Gambit. Also, I just hate how I've fallen victim to this. It makes me feel so angry honestly. Still, cool video! :D
The music is @epicmountainmusic 's All of History, but they aren't credited. Why? :(
Levy being a jockey. Hahaha
9 year old "novice"... "I'd probably checkmate them with Rook H3..." Right. Novice. I'm such a f**** failure XD
The “first” level 8 year old did more explaining than Levy 😂  AND 920 ISN’T A NOVICE 😆
WIRED?! WE EATING GOOD NOW LEVY
I haven't watched it yet, but I'm guessing I'm about a 1 (plus or minus 1).
Today I learned I’m whatever is below a novice at chess
Beautifully, thoughtfully done, on so many levels <3 Bravo to all involved.
Oh man, I love the Dutch. Awesome to see that. That variation of the Classical Dutch is the Rubinstein, just a transposition of it. While the Dutch Defense is maybe not the most elite opening for black, it's a great opening for players who like a lot of attacking chances and it can really put white to the test if they aren't prepared for it. A lot of players are not prepared for it. My two favorite openings for black, which I don't always play but always keep as sharp weapons in my arsenal, are the Dutch and French defenses. I don't like all the resulting lines but they are mostly very fun to play. Otherwise I'm playing e5 against e4 because I lack the discipline to make a serious study of the Sicilian as black.  I have taken chess more or less seriously over the years, but for me it's always about having fun, and I'd rather play a slightly worse position that I think will result in a fun game than the absolutely best move but I'm just bored or frustrated the whole time. The challenge then becomes knowing the fun openings much better than my opponents, and having a really strong sense of middle game tactics so I can brawl my way out to a favorable endgame.
Bad choice of novice. She's too experienced. Should've picked somebody who hasn't played any rated games before. Then move onto a club level player after that.
I missed having a real beginner in this video.
bro that novice know more about chess than me 😭😭
Not sure if this was asked but can someone explain why Irina does not play bishop takes rook one move earlier. She does not then lose that bishop to Levy's rook.  I doubt a grand master blundered so I'm wondering what it is I'm not seeing ?🧐
Seeing Levy with good make up on is creepy af AAHAHAHA
Me thinking he’d explain chess to someone at my level then seeing that this kid is many times more knowledgeable than I am
Levy with makeup scares me a little
This video made me realize that I watch too much GothamChess, and my style is very similar to Levy's... That's why I'm also stuck like the Eternal Runner-up
i would absolutely watch 5+ hours of Levy and Siddhartha talk, about anything, actually.
that lil girl is not at novis
Strange that some people call Fischer´s way of training chess dysfunctional, and yet it worked for him to become one of the greatest at the game.
That’s not a novice
Levy Lost against that kid?!?
Couldn’t finish the video. Not because of the content (love Gothamchess) but the editing and jump cuts every half second remind me of a Jason Bourne fight sequence. Way over the top.
Bros teaching the kid that beat him 💀
amazing girl. when i was 8 i tried to capture the king in my chess club
If Tani is "level 3" then Levy is "level 2", because he consistently loses against Tani since more than one year. I find it extremely pretentious how Levy is pretending to be "above" these level 3-5 players.
the freaking child moves like a master
not having the 2D board moves is a mistake. fix it going forward.
the the "level 1" kid seems more at ease with coordinates than most of Levy's subs ...
Your scale needs to include people beneath what you have described as novice.
When the novice is better than 95% of players.
God I love him
NOVICE EXPLANATION - it's a war game, where each player moves one piece at a time, there are 6 types of different pieces with different types of moves each, and the goal is to kill the king.
that 8yr old is not novice enough for me. Next time can we start with an actual beginner? Like me? I didn't learn anything about chess😭
I'm a 42 year old man, why does the 8 year old know way more about chess than me?  I know almost nothing about chess but still thought I would know more than an 8 year old.
1:18 "Level 1"
The 'novice' definitely wasn't a novice!! 😆  She was pretty advanced, (even for the average adult) already knew all pieces, how they move, referred to moves by the square names rather than physically reaching over and moving the pieces, naturally used chess terms ('positions are closed or open', 'trade', 'king is exposed' etc) oh well.
I think maybe the first level was a bit too advanced here. A viewer who isn't very familiar with chess would already be out of their depth right off the start.
whys the novice probably higher elo than all of us
That girl is not a novice, she is just young lol
If she’s a novice, I don’t exist. 😂😂😂
_Really_ liked the different structure and feel to this one, especially the games themselves which completely avoided getting mired in dry theory. Perfect for a video like this IMO.
Everyone, Levy is a chess pro. You might not like him; it doesn't matter. He's an IM. It's the second highest professional title. Relax.
Level: novice Representative: an 8-year old Performance: knows the names of the squares and immediately finds mate in 3
How long exactly does it take to gitgud at this? Novice 8 yrs old Interm 28 yrs old FIDE 13 yrs old GM 40yrs
not me lost on level 1
Imagine if they surprised Levy with Magnus at the end
Why did the game stop?
Can someone explain to me why at 17:24 he didnt go for the tower? I dont know much about this game..trying to learn.
No offence to levy, a very successful streamer, but he’s not really a chess pro
Really impressed with that 8 year old  (still have no idea how chess works)
Funny how chess is similar to martial arts: initiative, position, and capitalizing on your opponent's mistakes and punishing them.
I really like when the players are talking out their strategy while moving pieces
i dont understand a thing but that was fascinating to watch.
I was a 1400 in chess before i started watching Levy. Im a steady 1600 now. It doesnt seem like a huge jump but i was stuck at the 1400 area for over 2 years and just couldnt figure out why i couldnt improve
This is my first time seeing levi's legs
@11:50 it looks similar to the position with the previous player when discussing trade offs.
I learned NOTHING.
bro lookin zesty
Such an amazing video. Thank you Levy. The last part about creating AI chess bots that would replicate human play style was incredible.
Should've added a "Park Hustler" level
00:30 Levi's got to be thinking "But what about... THE ROOK!?!?"
Kinda hoped Hikaru would be the GM of choice, you know. Just for the memes
14:23 💀💀💀
Excellent! Such a delight!
Ok, What's lower than a novice? Where's that explanation?
Ok, he said starting at Novice,  and it's already way above me. Since he started with a kid,  I thought I'd be able to follow along a little better,  but uh...😂
bro is handsome
That's gotta be the quietest and most peaceful I've ever heard Levi be, when he taught that 8 year old. Sasuga "I beat kids" man. His redemption arc at last.
S1 E1? 🤔
They put the makeup on thick on the eyes Levy haha
Bro the novice is not a novice
Now do Go / Baduk 😂
That level 1 is supposed to be a novice. Holy. I really have NO CLUE about chess because I couldn't follow anything she was saying 😂
They did levy dirty with all the makeup, he's a beautiful man let him sing
A skoowa
Level 1 chess is already way better than I ever was.
Irina is a hottie
I was rooting for the kid! So happy he won! 😄
Levy. Mangus carlsen community manager  and casual chess player.
do this, but with magnus carlsen
the yapping during the games 😭💔
Please do Go!
TANI
Great video!! Fide master didn't describe initiative correctly and played very passively for someone who said they like to win quickly and be aggro.
interesting to see how gotham teaches people in real life as opposed to in his videos
Gooffamm, when is the next guess the elo?
Levi tried hard but the kiddo was just better 😭
Definitely a harder to teach for wired but super well put together 💪
You are saying at the start many people will watch this video, who never played chess and the first thing you talk about is thinking 3 moves ahead? I think this video should have started at level 0 for those people
I thought Levy was a grandmaster, and had been for a few years.
Riyae is adorable. And at the same time, she is not a “novice” by any stretch of the imagination. 😂
Level 5 Rey enigma
Tani is so comfortable. They made that so enjoyable to watch! Glad it didn't "time out"
25:18 White to move.  Bg2xRa8. Can anyone explain why that didn't happen?? Looks like a free move for White LOL.  I'm guessing she just didn't see it and then try to play it off as if it wasn't a good move....WOMEN
I don't know anything and am trying to learn. Why does time go up?
Dude. That 8 year old would destroy me in a game.  The only thing I can effectively do is make the fight a bloodbath for the opponent. Imma lose, but it’ll be tough for you lol
Dan hardy explaining MMA in 5 levels of difficulty
When she's a novice, I am a unicellular worm.
25:40 THE ROOOOOOOK!!!!
I'm sorry but Levy Rozman is not qualified as a chess expert, he's not even a Grand Master, bring someone better next time.
he is actually a very good teacher in person.
How much makeup does levy have
HEY WIRED!! You guys need to get John Danaher! He’s the perfect guy for these types of episodes.
If im not mistaken the first position is played by Magnus and Anand in the world chess championship 2013 where Anand make a big blunder.
This looks like the “best chess set ever” travel edition
Level 6 : magnus carlsen 💀
In what universe is that little girl a novice?
You got quite some makeup there, right?
even without the time consideration it was a loosing position
The young granmaster lady has spoken real Truth, her words should be inside a Chess school book
Levy told Anna Cramling not to call herself pro bc she doesn't play professionally
girl #1 is smarter than me
When the "okay"s came out lmao
1:47 I’m already lost
1:18 The "novice" is spittin' out algebraic notation with ease. Are you sure she's a novice?!?
That was not a novice.
this was great  IMHO it sounds like a matter of open= memorize  mid= theorize  end = strategize    As kids we'd play on 128 squares with two sets of pieces -- would that throw out your training and make us equals???????
Gotham in the vid :  🗿 Gotham ehile streaming :  😈😜👊🤬
This is not 5 levels of difficulty, it's five levels of age. The first kid already knew a lot
Chess players may try Go Game and you will get 2 more dimensions.
That was one of the best ones I've seen so far. Great video! As I look at learning language using AI, this really gave me some ideas.
Has he explained how complex is to become a GM?
So he asks the “novice” how she’d explain chess, she mentions explaining the different pieces, he then takes over and jumps forward without ever explaining the pieces. Confusing me, an actual novice who doesn’t know which one is which.
Grandmaster Gotham!!!
Level 4 was so beautiful. It reminded me of the episode with Jacob Collier and Herbie Hancock talking about music. Even though they were talking about a game, it felt artistic in a sense.   Level 5 unfortunately is not as beautiful. AI is very interesting don't get me wrong, but it's introduction to chess has made the game a lot more boring at top level, even if the players are better than they have ever been in history because of it.
I need hikaru to hop on this train
Holy crap, you had credits AND you didn't say get outta here....  what's going on dude?  Did somebody switch ON your neural net?
Chess is the most boring game in the world
Levy never fails to levy
"Within five years we will probably have a lot of human-like entities that we can interact with [that will hopefully have] the ability to produce actions like humans do."  Does this mean that cheaters will be even harder to detect? Instead of making one super-human move to get the upper hand in a game, they could make a series of moves just slightly better to get a similar advantage without any giveaways?
This 8-year old would destroy me in chess.
Is it just me or Levy looks a bit aesthetic here???
A+ for diversity and inclusion! 😂😂
where are the level 1s???
That it not a novice😭she know what she doing
I like Levy’s style of teaching. He asks questions and lets his “student” sort of lead the way.
Levy is the Bruce Pandolfini of our generation.
Why does levy look so feminine
Please more videos like this, Levy.  I get so much more out of this this than the usual analyzing a game between grandmasters.
This video title should be:  how Levy got lectured by 5 levels of chess players
Levys rise has been impressive and I'm here for it
I think we need to redifine what an eight year old "novice" is...
Gotham trying to become Magnus Carlsen
Whenever I see Gotham chess, I can hear in my mind: THE ROOOOOOKKKKK!!!!!
Didn't know levy was so chill
That's Novice level? Oof. Then I'm at destitute level lol.
Levy, how much makeup would you like? Yes.
3|2 is my favorite time control for blitz and Levy’s game with Tani is exactly why. It would’ve been a shame for one of them to lose on time during the Middle game. Tani’s tactics skills are super human. Great video.
WHY does IRINA look like she didn't shower that morning she looks a mess I wish she represented women better 🔥
35:10 ish, the scadal behind "Deep Blue" was TREMENDOUS. it turned out to be a team of GM chess players and NOT an actual AI playing... you should watch the documentary on it.
Great video but it would be cool to see the position of board as a digram in the bottom right. So, as they talk, it's easier to see what the intentions and moves are, without flipping back the video to remember it.
anyone who can explain ANY topic like this is a person who not only has a passion for it but also truly understands it top to bottom. there's some quote that highly relates to this, i can't quote it word for word but esentially, it states something along the lines of "if you can't explain something in a way that a young one, like the first girl, can understand then you, yourself do NOT understand it fully or rather as much as you THINK you do."
The GM game sounded like two bored gods playing with reality
I guess evil Levy must have tried to beat the 8 year old. Lmao
Levy vs tani was a good match! Irina is awesome! Would like to see level 1 vs level 2 for some instructive content  Also most curious is level 5. Surely the ai designer doesn't possess knowledge near the level of the created ai, however it was an interesting discussion
Great video levy!!
I like watching gothamchess. At first sight he seemed a little arrogant to me but later on i changed my mind about him i like the guy.
The weirdest part is being able to tell levi is wearing makeup
It bothers me how they’re mispronouncing fianchetto.
INSTRUCTED
I’m so dumb I don’t even know who won
Great video but you are concentrating too much on the players rather than the board, and thats what we wanna see
Ahhh.. lost to that kid.. chess is hard. I don’t even know how people play over the board that fast. Impressive
amazing levy!
I was expecting the grandmaster to be a child for a second by the clip that appeared before.
The ai part is fascinating because the topic is chess but the nodes they talk about and lack of emotion etc think how that applies broarder a field.
Levy is a wonderful teacher.
Is Levy wearing make up🤣
Levy said that chess is also about taking out all opponent's pieces. You really don't need to do that and the sooner you can checkmate, the better. Even if the opponent has all of their pieces still on board.
actually wired to this
No offense to Levy. Of course he is a skilled player, in fact an IM(or FM?). But, I think this would have been more interesting if the "Pro" is a GM or a legend like Gary, Magnus, Vishy, etc. but this is still a great episode. Thank you!
Chess "pro"
That's not a chess pro
I'm tearing up listening to Irina talk about chess. It's just magnificent when a person truly and purely loves something.
She’s a novice?!?
levy never fails to make me scream with delight
What happened to Levy’s face?
Levy is the greatest chess player of all time, the level of influence with chess for the past few years changed more lives than all of Magnus world titles
The bar for lv1 is way higher than i thought
lmao level 2 to 3 is quite the jump.  99.9% of people will never get to level 3
Why are they asking a guy who only understands chess to the 4th level of difficulty to explain the 5th level of difficulty?
This grandmaster made me love chess all over again😍
The way the little girl lit up @4:00 when you showed her the more sophisticated play was adorable
The kid at the beginning is better than like a third of the guys at my local club (knowing some tactics, knowing notation, knowing some strategic concepts like "open game" vs "closed game.") It's always nice to see a young kid be interested and knowledgeable about chess.
level 1 kid would smoke me lol
Lost in under 2 mins of video starting 🤪
Why does Levy look like he put on makeup? His skin looks like fresh paint!
I expected Magnus as the AI…
Despite my last comment. This got very, very interesting.  Thank you Levy and Wired <3
Would've loved to have seen tani and gotham give a breakdown of that game!
..and then you sacrifice THE ROOOOOOOOOOOK!
Brilliant concept, brilliantly done. Thank you.
Qc6 at 25:30? Am I missing something here?
He is not a chess pro tho... only a streamer and youtuber
That 8 year old is not a novice 😂
29:23 It's not too late Levy 😅
25:15 lol...Levy doesn’t want to lose😂
That first girl is no beginner! 😀 I am a beginner. She know chess. A grand master in the making.
Bone, thugs, and harmony really are the  most important parts of chess. Thanks, Irena.
Levy might lose less games if he stops giving up his rooks
Gotham Chess is amazing and I hope that this helps grow his channel even more. Great video.
I love how they started at “Novice” and I was already lost. 🫨🤣
Novice is seeing 3 moves down the road and calling them out using chess notation?   Sorry wired, I needed something more like "the white ones are White and the black ones are Black."
Can def tell the difference between Wireds videos and his normal ones.
the girl skipped 3 levels instantly 💪
To hear 2 masters pronounce “fianchetto”incorrectly make my head hurt … the ‘ch’ is pronounced as a ‘k’.  No, there are not 2 ways of saying it. There’s the right way and the wrong way.
it would be cool if you guys did speedcubing (rubik's cubes/twisty puzzles) in levels of difficulty!
New video just dropped
Insane he lost against Tani
hair and makeup went wild on this one
For all the clickbait Levy does, he is a really good teacher
Don't know if Levy will make grandmaster in chess, but he's a super grandmaster in communicating the game.  The guests were wonderful. Calling Tani a FIDE master is deceptiive - riding a rocketship up, and Irina still shows joy in finding each elegant and deadly move.  Thanks, Levy, hugely enjoyable.
The 8 year old knowing what a skewer is and properly naming the squares 👏🏼
i loved this so much. fantastic.
Yooo Taniiii
Awesome video! Levy is the best!!! Next time editor should overlay a digital display of the chess board
I guess this is one of the best chess videos I have seen on your channel, nice one! I would change the plastic pieces however, don't like how they sound😅
Levy is such a good teacher
Chess has a limit because it has no hidden information.
It's like getting a Harlem Globetrotters player to explain how basketball should be played. LMAO. You can get a real pro next time who played in major tournaments, WIRED. PLEASE!
Nice game Tani
Wired, why did you pick the least photogenic chess set? I can hardly see what the pieces are
Fide Master: I like to be aggressive and win as fast as possible.  *Pawns never move two squares and retreats the knight*
I loved the Irina part. She's just gained a new fan. Her way of laughing and talking about chess is just refreshing.
One of my favourite videos yet. Everybody offered such unique perspectives on chess, it was especially nice to have Irina share her knowledge and wisdom. I like that they had Tani on as a FIDE master, showing that age is not much of a factor in chess. It was also great to see analysis of Jeff's own game and have full games be played out. Just good stuff all around, Levy did very well here.
Who is this guy? I saw him featured on Magnus' channel couple of times.
This reminds me of starting a new year semester of math. Starts off so easy, as if the teacher has given up a floatie, and she's holding our head out of the water. Then, she gives us the homework, and it's impossible.
Why do they put makeup on you
Chess Pro?!?!?!
that fide master was awesome
Levy's face looks so weird
Love how levy makes the game so accessible to everyone.  But why did they use a filter on levy’s face? That’s looks so weird. 😅 I can’t look away.
Novice level conversation escalated pretty rapidly to speaking in code!!
The stupidest casting so far 😂
You overdid Levy's makeup lol
dude this is awesome.
LEVY IS THE GOAT!
I knew nothing
Is it just me or does Irina give off school counselor vibes?
Ai programmer knows more chess than a GM lmao
That was awesome, thanks!
"i beat kids" - levy rozman
Hi
And sacrifice the ROOK
I love this ❤
My goodness is Irina Krush attractive. I’m pretty sure she knows it too, which of course only increases the attractiveness.   K sorry I’m done being a creep. Just couldn’t contain it all for a second there; had to let some out - like an overpressure valve for creepy male energy.
Causually starts middle game planning to a novice? Lol.
25:22 why not bishop d5?
Why is it that when they got to grandmaster level with Irina Krush they did not show her rating? I hate videos that are inconsistent.
아이린아 씨는 너무 귀여워요
Levy wearing makeup 🔥
10:03 Tani brought the quiet sophisticated smoke. His brain & intellect will make a computer cry someday. GG
21:09 It's pronounced 'fianKetto'.
Levy is my dad
how lovely is Irina Krush
Did they put makeup on him? 😭
should have had the grandmaster at the end! her knowledge and description of the game was incredible. The AI guy was almost at novice level
How is Levy able to explain chess at the Grandmaster level?
the irony is that are kids that girls age who are far better than the level would suggest
That first girl was around a 1000 elo lol.
such cute girl! 🥰And that Riyae Park also.
I'm not 16 I'm 56 years old. I like to watch his videos and I don't understand why so many of the comments were written just to talk in a bad way. He is doing a good job and I think He is an excellent player, too. And the most important thing: A very complicated game like chess became famous under young people again. And he is one of thouse people who is responsable for it. I really  appreciate this
i dont understand why opening the a file against the grandmaster was a bad decision for her. his rook is trapped by the bishop so if he didnt trade rooks and give the open file then his rook would have to just go to b8, no?
🕊
Way to go Levy!
This was super interesting and unexpected. The "Novice" was quite advanced already, and the 'highest' level wasn't about technique or strategy but about AI and how its design could evolve and apply to improve our human abilities.  10/10, wonderful stuff @GothamChess. You deserve a lot of love and praise.
The Novice is so much better than people starting
not this guy again
Its almost 666 666 views on this vid💀
"if i was black" 14:22
Would have been good to put the graphic of the board on screen
I'm SO tempted to make an offensive joke about how each level is a different minority. Levels 4 and 5 are asian and jew. XD
The Chess pieces were not clear to see. This made for a bad video. Next time invest into a Wooden Staunton Set and align the pieces towards the camera. That way it is clearer.
Someone left kids alone with levy, don't they know his past 😂😂😂😂
having a 8 year old that explains a position with notation, and talks about king being on a bad square, as a novice is an attack on everyone learning chess.
bring back my boy's eyebags
Levy on Wired: I play things that i think will be fun Levy, analyzing my game on guess the Elo : BOZO!! A3? ooga booga A3?.... (i also invent my own openings)
so this is basically levys channel now where he uploads the non magnus carlsen vids
Wired never fails to be in Levy’s videos
Okay Wired. Great video, WAY too many long ads. Almost unwatchable. Will affect future clicks for me for sure.
No offense to Levi, but why wouldn't you have a GM (like Irina Krush, who's in this video), be the "Chess Pro"?
he's not even a GM, do better wired
imagine if it was hikaru instead of irina lmao. "yea not the best move, not sure why youre on here with wired"
Just cause shes 8 doesn't mean she's a level one. She'd beat everyone i know in chess 😂.
I don't know whose game I love better, Irina or the trash talking kid.
so nice to have real pros on the show... ;)
The Level 1 that you were looking for: Chess is a war board game with 2 armies moving on a battlefield, each trying to ultimately capture the enemy king.
Seeing Levy become Grandmaster is definitely something on my bucket list of things I can't influence but want it to happen.
Levy? how many pounds of makeup did they put on you? Are you ok? Can you breathe?
Mesmerizing part with the AI scientist. Sounds like there will be the possibility to have customised personal AI that ubderstands your playing style, can play in very specific styles that you want to play against and can act as a personal coach. So intriguing how much education can improve then
They put sm makeup on levy 😂😂😂
great video overall - but geez, it wluld really have helped to keep the shots on the chessboard a whole lot longer so we could actually follow along. ...
Seems like same basic animations could have added a ton to the video
OMG Levy,  Let someone else make a video on Wired!!!
its uncanny how weird levy looks without his eyebags
When they had Irina Crush on level 4, I thought theyd definately have Magnus on level 5, kind of disappointed now :D
WIRED Levy video got more views in 2 hrs than their Maths vid.
Good God, WIRED milking Levy that's crazy..........
I was just surprised that the novice is better than me 😳
I must be level 0 or sum. He aint nvr explain to us this sophisticated on his Channel😂  P.S. Love watching GMs & IMs play & hearing what is going on in that head for every move. I get so entertained and intrigued.
Wonderful video
I love that Irina shared her Journey of becoming GM at 29! I hope it helps as a Motivation to Levy and everyone really... Maybe not everyone can become GM, but age should not be a barrier to improve in what you love. Specially chess
One of the most joyful videos i’ve seen in time!
Brand new to Chess, no idea how it all works. What's the best way to start learning?
wired ft. gothamchess? deja vu
fir gurl was itermidiate
Great footage. What was this shot on?
this "online video essay" persona that he's done for Wired and Chess Support and other online journalism sites feels so fake and so forced. For me personally, i don't love that GothamChess has kind of become this online chess ambassador, i don't think he's skilled enough to offer a high level insight to the game, and i dont' think he's charismatic enough to be appealing and compelling to the lay viewer. Every time he talks you can tell that he's trying to show off how smart and insightful he is, he doesn't exude humility or passion for the game.
I quit chess a year ago cuz i was blundering for 9 games straight. Guess I need to take chess again. Learn firmly. Patiently. And hope I get a 4 digit elo.
It's funny, i like Levy a lot more when he isn't on his own channel.
Irina is cool
I'd pull up the position I beat levy in blitz and ask him to analyze it
Love these videos!
The camera angle they used for the games is terrible.  Anyone who plays and/or learns online would be able to follow their moves much better if they used the North to South angle.
Irina was an amazing surprise. She is really fun and would be an amazing streamer/YouTuber
She’s a novice?
Levi didn't just sacrifice the rook he straight up abandon it
Problem 1) An "AI Expert" being considered a higher level than a Grandmaster Problem 2) A Grandmaster is a higher level player than Rozman, so he doesn't have much to explain to a GM.
Levy explaining to a GM??
You should have video only the board - i less care about the people faces lol, I want to see the board while he is talking and explaining...
8 year old secret GM.
That 8 year old is better at chess than I am lo
Levy sacrificed the rook against Irina for the memes
Bold of WIRED to have Levy "explain" chess to someone who's better than him lmao (Irina is rated more than 100 points higher than Levy)
Ai playing human like moves will ruin online play forever, cheaters will ruin the game
Them allbirds!
To make a realistic AI, why not just limit the training sample to players with similar play styles and limit the allowed search depth?
Is there a biography or autobiography on GM Irina Krush?
8:22 If I was what
level 2 bro like 500 elo?
Levy make me remember lelouch that strategy and tactics part
I feel so dumb watching this I don't know or understand anything about chess 😂
Bro i swear to god i didnt recognize levy for a bit, was like whos this pro pleb xdd
you like help me Iam begginer
I like game
I love levys hint to Nikola Jokic horse racing after his NBA championship:D
twitch chat is literally worse than the level 1 - the 8 year old lmao
Has Irina never seen Naka's stream? All he does is repeat the same sentence 3 times, then move on to a saying, then some variation of "no way chat, are you for reals, no chat come on for reals", before then repeating some other sentence 3 times and repeating. Not exactly stellar conversation
I was waiting for "novice" to rip off her MI mask...
Anybody noticed that levy had makeup on
Levy looks so wierd in this video. Its like he has 64 layers of makeup
I like how Levy talks to a little kid knowing he is a fm and respects it
The GM lowkey inspiring levy to try again to hit Gm. Obviously he must need to improve his mental health first. Best of luck levy!
No way that first girl is novice lol.
Best thing for Levy being IM is he has less pressure to win and focus on containt
Levy looks like Kwebbelkop
Computers are really better than humans?
Levi on WIRED, wow. Congrats man!
Irina taught us why Levi has room to grow for GM. Harmony, space, time.
Amazing seeing you do a 5 Levels, Levy! 😍
Thats the classical dutch, Rubinstein Variation
Is my boy Gotham wearing makeup?
The girl is clearly not a novice
It's always fun seeing Levy play Tani. That video of Levy being decimated in the park is legendary
The novice level is not Novice for most people haha
Soon there will be an AI programmer at the end of every WIRED Explains video.
2n equals infinty over n  knights
It's already impressive how the 8-year old can communicate with chess notations and different tactical themes.
play chess center coners knights draw queen right turn
I had to keep checking if the first girl was the novice because shes waaaayyy more advanced than i am....
Irina Krushed that game
How much is this dork paying his agent? Sick of seeing him on every other channel around recently.
1 millions IQ
I wish they had kept aboard on the bottom of th3e screen the whole time.  Its hard to follow the game with the cuts back and forth.
One of the best episodes on Wired. By far a candidate for top 3 episodes of the year!
In the FIDE game, why did the clock _add_ seconds when they stopped their timer?
You should really put the Birds Eye view online board on the screen during positions so we can follow along
is it just me or does his face look like AI, like the eye area
29:04 you can actually appreciate Levy's heart getting crushed live 😂😂😂
This is inappropriate, he's not a GM. Someone with a higher level of expertise should be leading. Imagine doing this in physics but with someone that has a bachelor's degree and is widely known to very much not be top notch.
Levy never fails to make a great video about chess
Levy's experience with teaching kids is really showing here. It's a good look on him
Three is no advanced 1500-1600 elo sadge
the amount of makeup on levy is crazy.
Favorite episode by far
Levy never fails to feature in a WIRED video
Sorry, but that kid is not a novice. She's already got pretty good insights.
UNFAIR the 8 year old already knows more then me lmaoo good video!
I would love to see Levy getting to GM. I think a lot of his fans would hah.. :P And I think it would mean a lot for him also.. :)
Levy looks like a drag queen
Dewa Kipas = Level 0
"chess pro"
at 25:29, i thought she could pin your queen but your bishop would block... but she does have a free rook doesn't she?
Level1 is not Level1... There are too many concepts for a beginner (tactics, plans, strategy, vision, open the king...)  My Level1 would be: "Name of the pieces, is a "war" game between two sides, the side that  "kills" the other enemy's king is the winner, how the pieces move and capture, how a king "dies"- that is called checkmate..."
Fascinating!
Jews
Waiting for levy to say "right, I'm wearing makeup" in his next video
The little girl was not a beginner at all, you can tell that she knows a lot about the fundamentals of chess, they should've brought a kid that had little experience with the game.
what up with the makeup bro
that kid was most Definitely not a novice. It'd take me 2 min to find that 3 Continuous moves checkmate :/ quit lying @WIRED
nice concept there Levy.:)
I’m sorry but a “novice” is not someone that is referencing “Rook to H4” etc. they would say “the horse thing moves to the black square”
bruh that 8 year old was at least 300 points better than 80% of Levy's viewers
Levy and the first girl were amazing to hear the care of Levy and how bright the girl is. Levy and Irina were brilliant, kudos Levy.
Kind of bittersweet, on one hand I would love to see @GothamChess be a GM, on the other hand, if that meens retirement, I dont want to see that for many years :/
AND HE SACRIFICED.... THE QUEEEEEN!!!!!!
An analysis board would have been greatly helpful for the blitz games.
It's crazy to think there are 10 year olds who would absolutely dismantle 99% of people in a game of chess.
Thanks Levy & Wired. A short question (Novice player here). In the game with Irina 25:29  Why did you not worry (or Irina not consider) Bishop (g2) takes Rook a8?
true but why Levi's face looks so pale tho LOL
This video went much more in depth than I initially expected. Very interesting!
You can clearly see that Levy was an amazing chess teacher before doing YouTube, just the way he explained it to the 8 year old. Just an amazing guy.
*Chess pro* *GothamChess*.... Scammed
I think "novice" is really the good word to define the little girl's chess
Bros rocking that makeup
i'm a 1200 and 9 year old
I love levy's content, it's a pleasure to watch him teach as much as i love him screaming about the rook.
⠀
Chess is ageless but unless you start 4 youre not becoming a champ
Yuk, I hate the idea of blitz! I don't think I can think fast enough...
Novice could beat me every game.
So weird seeing Levy behave like a normal human being.
Might just be me but the black squares on the chess board made it a bit hard to spot the black pieces. A traditionally colored board would have been better for example
Thanks for metioning Maia. I found 'her' on lichess and played a few games. Had a good experience.  But a fun fact: Maia1 (1100) has a rapid score of 1467
They brought Tani for this😃😃 We love Taniiii!!!!!!🤠🤠🤠
That girl is definitely smarter than me,  I'm only 1300-1400 and plays bullet exclusively, because then, i can just be fasttt asf and deactivate my braincells.
levy with makeup is quite a victorian nightmare
Get outta here
why does Levy look really different here. it's like his skin is airbrushed. or his eyes are different
Excellent video. It just got better. Had fun watching Tani, Irina, and the   ai researcher blew me away
10:23 that kid, tani is levy kryptonite. I like that kid. I wish that kid will surpassed Master Level
Tani is really bright and wonderful
Hardly a Pro
Man, that novice is a 1.2k rating
Therapist: Levy with makeup can't hurt you Levy with makeup:
FM and IM such an amazing game ;)
I love Irina's videos
how did levy lose to that kid
Finally we see Levy in his sane form
That novice is better than me 😂
chess is one of those sports that you can play together both genders, like statcraft… definitely not football or mma
To the WIRED team, when you show the board, don't show it horizontally. It's way harder to read and that's not how you illustrate chess positions.
Can't believe Krush took part in kasparov vs the world and still looks young today.
Bro lost to a kid 😂😂
Congrats Levi
Question how much make up did levy did like amount of powder he used
I really enjoy this series of videos but this one was a complete miss for me. The most basic level was already using vocabulary without any explanation assuming the audience is familiar, and by level 4 there's nothing I can even understand being said, which is somewhat kind of the point of this video, isn't it? Comparing this with other videos in the series it feels like there was little or no effort made to actually dumb the concept down for a common understanding or attempt to discuss it in anything other than a language competent chess players would understand.
Levy never fails to talk about chess
Levy's not really a chess pro, but a pro YouTuber. Only a very small number of elite players rated like 2700+, are truly pro chess players.
Why leavy make up😂
Irena would crush Levy like a bug
That 8 yr old was impressive
He's not even a GM!
i loved this video honestly it wasn't like an over abundance of information like when you had niel on it felt more like a conversation this series you got is working and i love that levy's personality shined through more then what he was talking about 10/10 video and even learned about chess initiative which was super cool
The conversation with the AI researcher was so deep and both took away some learnings I feel. Levy has a talent for conversing with people in their style and comfort level. The disparity between Levy on stream vs Levy here is enormous.
Is it the Krush who took on Garry Kasparov (with help of rest of the world)?
Levy in his zone and happy place.
Level 3 can kick Levy's butt?
Levy never fails to feature WIRED in his videos
Irina is a boss
why does levy sound like an ai and looks like something out of uncanny valley in this video
Watch the beginner : Oh so i am not even a beginner 😂
levyyyyyyy
We don’t need AI to simulate humans of different levels. There are 7 billion plus people on the planet. We have plenty of people who can engage with the game at all skills. We would be better to use AI to remove human suffering so that more people have the time and space to place chess.   I don’t need AI to play chess with. I want people to play chess with.
That little girl wasn't a beginner lol
Levy never fails to appear
The makeup is so annoying
How is Levy the pro when Irina such a better player and so well spoken? Should have made her the pro in this show.
I’m three times the age of the “novice” and I can confidently say that she would beat me 10 out of 10 times
Video was frustrating for me. I tried examining what Levy was talking about but because the camera kept pointing to the people instead of the board I could not quickly catch what he was talking about without pausing it. Otherwise good video.
Anybody else notice Levy with a hole in his hand??? 2:39
Levy never fails to beat kids, sadly not this one.
not really a pro
This video screams “diversity” more than it does chess, unfortunately.
hey Wired, you forgot to add 2 more levels after Grandmaster: Hikaru & Carlsen 🙏🏻
levy never fails to put on makeup.
If that 8 year old is a novice and being that good at chess, what am I? 😭
Is he wearing makeup lol
I think they should’ve had a beginner beginner who didn’t or barely knows how to move the pieces and stuff. I think that many viewers may not fully remember chess and that would make for a good introduction or refresher
Levy is the man!
Levy never fails to be in another WIRED video.
Tani is definitely headed to gm level. I remember him playing against Hikaru. He's quite funny too lol
WIRED is basically Levy’s 2nd channel now lol
Levy is everywhere!!!
Always great to Levy <3
This levy should play chess
I love this series, and I watch Levy sometimes! What a perfect crossover!
Tani take a bow! What a game, love the kids story as well
5 levels of difficulty, and you lost to level 3/5? Bro... I wanted you to focus! Do it again and stop thinking of what to say. hehe
Would be cool to include 3-4 levels before the "level 1" explanation
Too much of makeup levy 😂
Wait if gotham is a pro than what is ??magnus is he god?
THE ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOEOOSOOOOOOOOOK
lol this 8 year old is talking on a level many adult players can’t even think.
you call this guy pro??? lol
Levy never fails to show how to play chess.
how is AI programmer the highest level of chess 😂 what a joke
why's he wearing so much makeup. like why
Everyone thinking that 8yo is super talented...  I am not saying she isnt, but you havent really seen what some 8 year olds are capable of🥶
This little girl would likely whoop me in chess 😂
You can tell he has taught lots before he did YouTube
Ngl, its kinda disrespectful to the to GM to bring the AI expert as a "higher level".
Levy is so pretty with makeup
Must be AI he didn't yell THE ROOOOOOOOOOOOK at anyone.
Levy brings best chess contents❤
The makeup team went a bit too far on Levy lol.
Levy never fails to make his forehead bigger every video
levy "i beat kids"
There’s no way that was a novice
GothamChess is so PC
wish he'd shut up.
The AI part was particularly interesting to me because this engine imitates human play at different levels instead of playing the best it can all the time. The strength of an AI engine like Stockfish is that it is so immune to error, but that is also a weakness in terms of using it as a training tool to play against human opponents. The fact that Maia can imitate different levels makes it particularly interesting, as it can mimic opponents you are likely to be playing against.
I wish you'd actually concentrate on the game while playing instead of talking bs, analyze it afterwards.
The makeup is so weird
THEY GOT IRINA KRUSH???
Personnaly, i know you as The Insufferable Clickbait Artist. Just kidding. Kind of.
Holy crap how old is Tani?
Levy looked goofy with all that makeup on his face but great video
That kid in the beginning is not a novice lol
Who tf is this little girl? She knows more about chess than me and I’ve played liked 1500 games this year
ya that 8 year old just beat me in chess.. she's a natural
Small production tip… lighter dark pieces, like a brown/wood stain would be a lot easier to distinguish between, especially with the dark squares also being black.
That 8 year old was definitely like 1200
Level 1 -    "This thing here is a horsie and this bishop goes <Levy sound effect>BRRRRRRRRRRRRT!</Levy sound effect>  along the diagonals..... "    ;)
This levi guy is really likeable
Either that novice was much better than a novice or I am much worse than a novice 🤣
do more chess support videos like this
I can tell that 8 year old is not a beginner. She already knows a decent amount!
They were just playing with us and actually skipped the novice section, right?... right?? 😅
This video perfectly portrays Levy's experience as a chess teacher.
The novice was not a novice…
Levy on WIRED: 😇 💕 ✨ 😃 Levy on his own channel: 👹🫵🤬💀
Once computers got better than humans at chess, it got scary. AI is the inevitable realisation of those fears. We’re doomed!
fianchetto... fee ann KET oh. it means "little flank [attack]" so think of it like 'fiank attack"
Where's the chess pro?
Level 6: Chess is the extension of international diplomacy and war by any means.
Lmao is this dude wearing make up? Looking like ken
Levy never fails                   To lose to a child
Oh God, too much make-up, way too much on Levy.
I'm absolutely horrible at chess and forget what half of the pieces do but I'd be happy to watch more with this guy.
The fact he started with level 1 and I already got lost
When levy said his style I was like “ omg we have the same style!!” And then I remembered he was the one who taught me chess so makes sense
Also, I haven't heard of Maia, but I did have the thought this morning that it would be interesting to train AI to play 'human-like' moves at different levels, rather than optimising for winning chances.
Google en passant
Ok. That was really good.
Oh! Irina! Loves me some Ms Krush! She is an amazing player.
That 8 year old was NOT A BEGINNER!!!!!
Watching this you can see why he isnt GM yet. She had complete control the whole game, she knew every position, it was all planned out and had a response to everything. Levy kept doing things without understanding why " this is intresting what if I do this." Where as Irena already knew the consequences.
I don’t even know how to checkmate
17:40 you sit down levy, let him carry the episode😂
It would be nice that someone like hikaru or magnus coach levy to become a grandmaster
That little girl was not a novice compared to most people! lol She was saying words and terms I've never heard of, and that is awesome!!
Great video!  You did the impossible and explained the game of chess, backwards and forwards.  And Levy, watch out for Riyae Parks -- if she ever decides to create a youtube channel, she'll overtake you in subscribers within a year... she's great!
levy not saying get out of here to 8 year old is just not levy -.-
Jesus. That 8yo kid understands chess better than I do!!
Hey it's that BingChilling Chess guy.
thats not a novice, easily 1800 +
Unusual to not have the stare at the beginning of the video ;( 6/10 for this reason
Levy glam up 🔥 got make up and everything
If that 8 year old is a novice, my elo is a negative number and my ego has been destroyed. 😭
The novice level was comprehensible, yet surprisingly advanced.
Seeing a food blogger succeed in chess gives me such a joy.
That 8 year old girl seem smart for a novice and would probably beat me in a chess game 😢
l like how wired always consider a little kid as a beginner. meanwhile some of them could be more advance than the viewer  note for wired team: if some of you read this, could you guys come up with a topic that the age range is reversed?
Great video 🥰🤘🇩🇰💪
YESSSSS!
c5 is the strongest response for black in Caro-Kann confirmed by Stockfish at incredible depth (60+) and it's the move played in the largest percentage of high quality games, which are correspondence chess games (not some grandmaster level games which on absolute chess strength scale are mediocre). So Levy you are not teaching your students the best move for intermediate player. You are teaching the absolutely best move to them, and GMs playing Bf5 actually got it wrong ;).
Alekhine said once "we don't master chess; chess masters us".
Levy should be a GM
How much make up should I apply? - Yes.
amazing to see Tani in this video, he is so talented and intelligent!
Hardly a novice, she's at least 1100
Great way to slow y chess to non chess players at least so they understand how great it is
I am subscribed to both levy and irina
Levy has empty hands at 2:39 it's so weird
Just liking because GothamChess.
Levy with makeup looks so weird to me lmfao
Levi: who moves first?  Tani: well, the custom says that white moves first.  Levi: *moves pawn to e4
Only 5 LEVELS?    Origami was 14 levels…
That 8 year old show big promises!
Explaining chess to level 4: *she explains chess to you instead*
"Chess pro"
Levy never fails to include wired in his videos
I have so many things to appreciate about this video and I'm not even finished watching.  About chapter 1&2: Levy has so much experience as a teacher and he shows all of it in those 2 chapters, which is very nice to see. In general Levy's energy appears as very wholesome to me, but especially in the first 2 chapters, he was capable to explain things in a way, where I would bet, that everyone understanda exactly what he means. This is incredibly difficult as probably every tutor can confirm.  Chapter 3: First of all, Levy getting crushed by a youngster - always a classic. And then their conversation during the game made the game feel so much more alive.   Chapter 4: This chapter proves my point, that GMs are superior to us morals. The way she explains what chess is to her is just mind-blowing. It's such an interesting and at the same time impressive way to think about those 64 squares. Gives me some Queen's Gambit-Vibes. And the fact, that Levy took the role of the person with the questions (since she is the superior player) supportes the development of the story of this video.  All in all, I'm very happy with this video and Levy& Wired are a dream team❤
I'm here for Irina.
an IM explaining chess to a GM? hmm
Levy is such a great teacher, he has a gift for it
Fantastic video
With respect to Gotham , but that make up is crazyy, Wired need to fire whoever did that shi
They should have included a 2-D board for the audience to follow along, and the FM & GM should have explained some famous games instead of playing without the audience realizing what's going on OTB.
way to go levy. also the "beginner" was  a brilliant kid haha
TIL I am less than a novice at chess.
Um excuse me, I was told there would be a novice in this segment.
levy is far nicer to these people than his own viewers lmao
That is the most expert 8 year old novice I’ve ever seen.
Levels of Go would be a good topic.
This was a great topic and a great host of the episode.  I loved that there was more discussion than explanation.
As expected, lots of coping 600's in the comments. "The little girls not a novice!" I think Levy enjoys giving y'all a reality check.😂
24:40 rook a8 is hanging no ?
Levy to the kids: “you’re right, that’s a good idea, and this is the next best move.” Levy to his subscribers: “what are you doing?? you bozo!”
Is the chair Levy is sitting on just tiny? or is the perspective playing tricks on me?
Lets go Riyae!!!! She was @ Grade Nationals this weekend!!!
Can someone explain to me why she didn't take the rook with her bishop before levy moved his bishop?
If that girl is a novice then I'm a dairy cow.
When you start the video a level too high so the last one is just about AI lmfao. that 8 year old is like 1200 stop playing with me.
Dang, that first young lady is quite that the "novice" I have to say.
I don't know how to feel, as a seemingly intelligent person, about the fact that the first little girl having a chance at mopping the floor with me. Unless she was prompted, she identified a 3 move checkmate without hesitation with a random position in 10 seconds. Woof.
The day Levy makes grandmaster is the day the whole of internet will smile
History of thousands of years? Even if you take the earliest dates for the birth of chess, it would be 3. century at best.
For those of you out there who are thinking of buying a chess set for a youngster, remember that them learning the rules of the pieces' movement is only the first part of the game. They need to learn HOW to play the game. Encourage them to join a club, at the very least.
The first girl is going to be a higher ELO than 99.5% of Levy's audience.
Think about what you would do if white got 3 moves in a row...Fabulous, that one statement just opened so many doors for me!!!
The 8 year old was fantastic, really smart and articulate. She totally gets it.
levy doesnt look human, he just looks like an ai avatar
makeup team on point. levy lookin like a snack
I would like AI to understand how to analyze and situate human play to be able to fashion the best training programs individualized to the player.
25:03 and i'm like why doesn't the GM see the pin on Levy's Queen.. she can move Bd5, but then i'm like ohh he block with his Bishop and it actually helps him develope his B and connect the Rooks.. good grief i wouldn't stand a chance.
hey great game with the gm but why not take  BXA8? you win material and can then if you want defend with the queen or lose a bit of tempo for +5  mat  25:04
Beautiful.
at 17:20 you could have taken the rook with your king, and then put the bishop on the spot to defend.
"Time, space, and harmony" is a fascinating words for a war game.
@2925 "I think if you're an international master like you are, everything is in reach" "So it's not too late levy".... levy proceeds to become a GM a year and a half before the final youtube edit drops.
The microphone is a little tinny and sharp on the ears.
why does he have makeup on, zestyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I have a crush on I. Krush.
Usually with these five levels videos, I find myself somewhere well above the child, and well below the expert. Here I can tell the kid would destroy me in about eight moves.
I liked how the channel included the players ELO.
Oh no, I just realized that the first person was the "novice." I don't think they have a word for how I play.
Constantly trying to make chess seem cool😂
I’d like a video wherein Levy’s makeup artist explains him/herself.
Could you please do one on Boxing or Judo?
If Tani is level 3 I'm never getting out of the first level....
The 8 year old already has great knowledge about the game and fantastic at being able to articulate her thoughts. If she's a novice than I'm whatever is below that LOL
W
Great content. Really has me excited to play chess.
Levy never fails to lose to kids at chess
2:39 Levy has started ascending so much that his right hand is becoming transparent.
The make up on levy looking good
I'm waiting for Levy to sack the ROOOOOOOOK!
Why are Levy’s eyes so dreamy in this episode? Is he wearing make up?
The Game against the FIDE Master was spectacular
Dude.  That girl is NOT a novice.
I love Levy! Thanks so much Gotham Chess! I love Irena’s take too!
Levy, man, how far you've come in those last 2 years. Love how you explain it to the kid and to see this patient side of you 😂! She's so smart 😊
A great video, but in my opinion, the first level is too advanced, I would show a simpler take, to show to someone who has never played that it can be interesting even to someone who just learned the game. But I know that chess can't be shown in just 5 levels of complexity.
Did you know Levy owns youtube?
Seems like levy had some makeup for his eyebags
I enjoyed how GM Krush first missclassifies it as a Leningrad, (a ruse perhaps) and then proceeded to demonstrate the fundamental opposition to it, ie fienchetto LSB, defend against black’s e5 push, expand on queenside.
Level 4: Grandmaster Level 5: AI Expert FIDE is not amused.
Level 6 should be Magnus Carlsen.
How is an IM meant to explain a level he can't achieve? Dropped the ball on this one WIRED.
Can you please tell me where I can get that chess set? I've been looking for it for a long time and couldn't find something as good.
I liked how levy taught a player of higher rating than hin
Once levy gets to tahni's level they should be explaining to him 😂
That little girl is very talented. Full of potential!!
Please put "Pro" in quotes. He's the weakest IM I watched
29:26 GM GothamChess one day
I havent watched the whole video yet. But it would be fun to see Anna Cramlings mom on here. She is a legend and her positional chess game is out of this world. Her video with levy was a blast.
Very good explanation by Levy, wish he would have played a blitz against the AI at the end tho
Refhrrs idgfxik9no gambitrx apno fren funiz🎉
Outsidd radaflrdx sfltudy afk cant read ray momkizx nitr9 estio
Would an AI be able to predict the moves a player would make only based on the analysis of all his past games? It would be helpful at the end of the game to understand if i'm making always the same mistakes, where the flows are, if i'm improving my decision making in specific position that might require a kind of strategy or tactic.
Coinrx jjape nk vision9😮6
Well the eight year old seems better than 90% of us, so I’m not sure how many “levels” we’re talking here.
Knowing me, I would find a sixth
No “THE ROOK!!”
Not an 8 yr old being 1000x better/more knowledgeable on chess than me 🥲
Love how the makeup department made Levy look sassy
So, another game where Levi cant beat a GM. Nothing new here.
Wow I’m bad at chess
Half an hour of levy teaching chess without constantly calling me a bozo or and idiot is quite rare.
Thanks to this video I finally beat my grandfather. After the video was over I just snapped and started hitting him, idk why
I hope it isn't just the normal thing now to know how to play chess relatively well because I don't 😒😒 (edit: this is a good video but it makes me feel sorta bad about my chess skill)
The horse racing Jokic joke was well played.
Why did the 8 year old explain chess better than levy
tf is going on with the clock??
That first girl is not a novice, I'm a 1200 and I feel like she has just as good, if not a better understanding of chess than I do. She knows the squares and everything off the rip without looking at the board, I can't even do that. It could be just the way the video was made but she seems more experienced than the "intermediate" player.
Levy is too nice to be a GM. Super ambitious people have some inner dark side that allows them to not care about anything except accomplishing their goal
The 8 year old is higher ELO than me
19:45 my dumbass thought she‘s gonna say bishop or some☠️
At higher levels, I guess Hans was right: "Chess speaks for it self". They just started playing blitz.
the level.1 girl was better than me. she knew the chess square letters and game up with a mate in 3... dafuq
I've tried to learn chess. I'm too stupid.
That kid isn't a novice. She's way too familiar with chess terminology.
“CHESS PRO”
I will be there the day Levy becomes a GM 💪
Levy is great, Irina Krush is a legend
Levy is such a good teacher, that they named the Levitsky Attack after him
Why’d they put makeup on levy he looks so weird
When level three was already FM I was wondering what was going to show up!
Kool to see skill level is totally non-linear with age :)
I wish most adults wer half as smart as that 8 year old 😅
Absolutely loved the show! The concept of exploring the various levels we all have in our minds or navigate through is brilliantly executed. However, I do have some reservations about the statement made by the AI expert Siddhartha Sen. His focus on creating AI to mimic human reactions, observing how humans respond to make AI more human-like, raises some psychological concerns. Designing AI to emulate human decision-making is a significant issue, especially in a world where AI is becoming increasingly accessible. It's quite alarming to contemplate how well AI can replicate human decision-making and potentially dominate various aspects of our lives. The human mind is incredibly diverse, far beyond the limited equations used in AI. The portrayal of this in the episode seems somewhat uncritical or casually accepted. It's a substantial concern that, if left unaddressed, could lead to a future where AI heavily influences, if not dictates, our daily lives. Just my thoughts on it!
Level 1 is to bring out the 8 year old 1600 ELO
The woman at 4th uses really irritating vocal fry.
Levy gettin' cooked.
They shoulda done a support for totally new player levels and exposed to chess levels
Would have been hype if it was hikaru
Tell Levy that he is not good at chess
GET HIKARU ON HERE
Levy has got bare makeup on
Levy owns Wired at this point
Well, now I have a Krush on Irina.
Good video, however,  the blackboard makes it hard to see the pieces
I love chess
Levy is the Magnus of Wired.
Nepo is frothing at the mouth 😂😂😂😂
Shame you couldn’t do your research properly and you chose a 🤡 to speak for chess disgraceful
First time the Novice is more knowledgable than me
That kid was not a novice, lmao.
I love Tani but it's pronounced fianchetto with a K sound 🤌🤌
So its possible to build a 3000 ai that still plays like a human? Asking for a friend. can not imagie any harm
♟️🔥
Bro why am I getting dogged on by the novice tf
If she's novice then I need to uninstall the chess app lol
It feels weird seeing Levy not act like a crackhead like he does in the livestreams.
the audio on this sounds awful
Levy is coming up in the world, he did a great job at the Champions tournament.
As a novice imma a little hurt they choose a litterly child to represent lol
Levy never fails to lose to children
Interesting
How much makeup did they put on him lmaoooooo
No offense, but why does Levy look like he had a lot of makeup on or something??? He looks completely different
this loser is on the spectrum and constantly bans people
Non chess player edited this? This is not a chess movie. They should have shown the  positions in 2d board
He is not a chess professional, he is extremely weak compared to actual professional players. He is, in fact, a crypto scammer and a youtuber.
Levy to an 8 year old: See, if you move here you can have the king in check rather than getting instant satisfaction....  Levy to his subs on YouTube: THE ROOOOOOOOOOK!!!!!!!   😂😂😂😂
The kid was no beginner🚫🚫
I’ve been inspired to start playing chess by levy since the pandemic hit, and to this day levy is still such an inspiration! This is indeed one of the most unique episodes of five levels. Loved it! Gotham may not be the best player but the best promoter of chess.
Smile, Levy
💎💎
Please make sub 1000 elo bots that don’t hang pieces/mouse slip too willingly.
I am happy that I have the same pair of Allbirds as Gotham lol
Tani as the third level is insane, man has scalped Levi over the board before lol. By all standards dude is an expert.
"Im wearing a black hoodie, black pants...." I was scared where this was going 😂
Did we start the video backwards? I was immediately out of my element on this one. lol
25:20 like a typical woman 😂  What do you want to eat!?   Her: idk   😂
Get it Levy!
Here to remind everyone that GothamChess is a notorious clickbaiter.
Levi, that kid is NOT a begginer, stop lying to us, she's probably 2400 elo
levy starts explaining chess to the young girl at the start but doesnt realise she is already 2000 rating
as an "artist" I would say a piece of art is never finished, it just ends at some point
In chess, age fades away; elephants dance in the sky, while fish dive into the abyss.
Levi looks so weird with all that makeup on
Levy without mentioning Magnus in a whole video - I kinda felt a disruption of the force ;)
yes yes yes
I love Tani!
Levy casually hard carry WIRED
levy with makeup look so weird
I thought of would be Novice level, but I’m realizing eight year old Riyae would crush me.
The "novice" was actually very good! Way beyond novice level
Love to see Levy single-handedly reviving chess to become a mainstream sport 🎉
The 8-yr old is so bright, articulate & PRECIOUS!   [ Sure, but can she clearly explain “en passant”? ]
They played so fast they gained time. Impressive.
wired ft. levy is the best thing that happened this year
Yall did him so dirty with that goofy makeup
This video would be better with an overlay of the board state instead of just showing the real board.
Tani is such a cool kid
The 8 year old explained chess better than me and im a 14 year old 💀
Is it me or does he have makeup on?
I think there needed to be a level 0.
Levy is a very dope person
I don't want to sound like im flexing because I'm really not if 1000 is a high level you probably don't understand a word of what levy said
I love the fide master jacket
What a wholesome kid. Took time out of her day to teach levy how to play
I really liked this video and appreciated the players who joined the discussion. 😊
I watch chess all the time. Never heard of Irina. Really liked her style and confidence
but where's the chess pro?
This 8 year old is smarter than me.
Fianchetto is pronounced with a c sound not a ch sound.
"Chess is mental torture" Grand master Kasparov
Levy at 25:35 was way too relatable.
Levy, with no offense intended, is not the Herbie Hancock of chess.
I like how the kid at the novice level says rook h3, queen h5, queen takes h7 check so quickly and it takes me a minute to find the coordinates of the tiles.
Levy never fails to make another weird video 🙌    Edit: wired*
Guess the 8-year-old's elo
Levy never fails to make another wired video
Irina!!
I appreciate the grandmaster playing for interesting. I'm sure she can draw Levy without effort, but it would be a boring game for the video.
To me, this is levy at his best. He is an amazing teacher. I respond to this style much more than those in his actual videos haha
Levi in makeup goes crazy
it would be so funny if they brought out alice lee or someone for level 1
Its nice to see Levy helping little channels as well as small chess players :)
This dude is awesome, he should have his own youtube channel!
He only managed to explain in 4 levels 😂 He is not even a GM.
Sad that it isn't Magnus as Grandmaster.
great video!   definitely one of the better 5 levels videos, love it
I was expecting him to say "sacrifice the ROOOOK!!" At least once.
Yo if that’s a novice… I don’t know what I am
I got to 1000 and I’m so afraid to play another game lol the trek was exhausting 😂
wired is in love with levy bro how many times has he been on here 😭
Wired makeup team did our boy dirty
Irina is fit! Thats what irina is!
Pls keep bringing Levy back
I pray these videos never end
Nahh bro why happended to his eyes 💀
LOL, look at what they did to his eyes with this makeup
Levy looks like a doll😂
TANI !! nice
8 year old better than Lorne White
I really like this format. I think this elevates Levi's content to the next level. I mean, I still like GTE, but this is awesome.
Hikaru: Levy would never be GM bec he never goes for it.
I hate when kids know more than me, luckily, much like old ladies, they’re really small and easy to beat in a fight
17:34 a xmas gift to a nice promising child ^_^
This was great. Levy is so likable. And that match against Irina was very entertaining, seeing two completely opposing approaches to the game play out.
What’s going on with Levy’s makeup in this video he looks way different than usual
XD oh Levy, pressure eats this poor guy..  lost all his games.
da ROOOOOK!! with brilliant signs, this should have been the thumbnail
Hey Levy, you did the thing with the thing!!
Seeing levy teach is so wholesome
"It's not too late Levy" I really want to see this happening now more than ever
That girl is no novice
Wow, fantastic!!  And no rook sacrifices...
Nice to see Tani in this video.
Feel like Wired should get Hikaru to explain it to 5 levels of chess players lol
I think the title should be "Chess Pro Explains Chess in 5 levels of Difficulty TO PEOPLE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH CHESS". That little girl is not new to chess at all.
Should have used a digital board
Chess never fails to include Wired in a GothamChess video!
Chess is one of the few subjects where assuming someone's understanding relates to their age is wrong.  This 8yo is clearly not a chess novice.  She understands the game better than 30yos who haven't studied chess at the level she has
Levy is consistently pretty brilliant in these media appearances though.
if that is actually novice level, im now really motivated to get started with chess.
nice! more levy in wired!
How did he not have a position ready to explain initiative?
Chess cheaters are rooting for the AI programmer.
when the novice is like 1000 elo
A teacher needs knowledge of learning theory and philosophy and good familiarity with teaching methods and strategies acquired academically and in practice. The best teaching plan would be to play one game against each level of student and point out their gaps, weaknesses and strengths.
So that's how he looks like without the dark eye circles.
Never thought Tani was that good 🔥
i was expecting Hans Neimann as the AI expert  💀 😅
Level 6: Teaching Magnus some chess
this guy is pretty good at talking, he should make a youtube channel or something
1150 to 2200 is a big leap
Jeeez the first girl in the lowest level of chess ?????
Me waiting for the Magnus name drop
some computer replay would be nice for those of us who don't touch any grass outside.
The 8 year old is too good to be a novice. Genuinely impressed by them. Should have got a total novice
5 Levis
They trying to scam the world by telling that AI “can make better decisions” in everything. What they don’t tell you is that AI is written “raised” by someone who would most likely have something wrong in his/her head   What if AI decided to stand with the enemy?  What if the enemy invents a virus so powerful to overwrite all of the AI tools?   What if AI goes rouge and decides to destroy a country or the whole planet???  That dependency can be catastrophic at least for the western civilisation if it keeps going by the current propaganda
if the first girl is a beginner, what does that make of me? 😢😢
does he have makeup on??
Oh this 8 year old girl is better at chess than me, who has been playing for nearly 30 years. Nice. 😂
i love Levy but i cant avoid to cringe knowing there is a  part where he explains chess to a GM ... XD lol
Is that make-up around his eyes?
he’s such a good teacher wthh
"chess pro". I feel like you should be more truthful with this. Levy is an influencer not a professional chess player
Magnus looks different these days 😮🎉
Sick, but why is Levy still trying to explain things after level 1?
Levy's makeup is hilarious
I'd love it if Levy could analyse the FIDE game they played on his channel.
Hey Wired! Levy is number 28000 in the world, pick a grandmaster
Levy is the bomb. What a great dude.
If they dont get it by 20 they almost never get it. hard cut to levy
Irina Krush is still the coolest name for a GM I’ve ever heard.
how come they didn't put the computer board at the screen for the games 🤯
OMG I am dumb.
5th level should have been a super gm like Caruana.
What a humble man to lose all the games to show respect
Levy with an 10 year old: *no precious, you did slight inaccuracy here, no worries, we can fix that*  Levy with his viewers: *you are an absolute disgrace, you should never play chess again, you absolute donkey*
I really love Tani and I was impressed in this video, how this young man matured lately.
I think that little girl already knows more about chess than 95% of people alive.
great to see
Woke culture is here guys... In the chess world you rarely see blacks and women and when you do see them they are reliably weak. They brought the best black kid in the world, for a beginner a pretty advanced girl and the strongest woman in America. For those that don't know chess let me tell you that out of 100 random chess players you might get 5 women (much worse than the average man) and maybe 0.1 blacks (somewhat worse than the average white). Again here the cleverest people are the best players. For example Jews are pretty strong in average compared to the rest men (not compared to women - women need their own division cause they are so much worse that men).
This was really cool. I feel like the GM vs IM level was interesting. I don’t know if I could describe my style of chess like that.
Holy cow is that Irina krush??? She was my role model for years back in the day ...
Wired never fails to adopt Levy
Yep botez sisters got ignored
Loving these Gotham cheese videos. Keep them coming!
Don’t know what would have been more funny, bringing Hikaru or Hans for the last one
Your best Wired episode!!!
Levy is such a hard worker look at this he now has 5 youtube channels.
The best part about this episode is how it shows each person’s unique conception of what the game is.
Wired has been milking Levy, I love it
Magnus is to Levy as what Levy is to Wired
"If they don't do it by 20 they'll never do it". *Camera cuts to Levy, age 28, non-GM
The young girl in the first part is wonderful!  She has an amazing grasp of the game for one so young.
first girl is definitely not a novice
What happened to levy's face
The amount of make up on Levy's face LMAO
novice,intermediate,FM,GM i think there is a slight gap but ok
Its about "possibility / probability"
Thanks Wired:)
Levy never fails to explain chess on 5 different levels
There are several possible moves.  How to know which are bad?
Bro has make up on frfr
Levy works for WIRED now, confirmed
Levy never fails to [obligatory comment].
why do i have the impression that the face of gotham looks like artificial today lmao
Is Levy technically a chess pro?
Wow.. level one was much more advanced than my first approach to chess... 😅
This mf videos is so fun to watch
So if that little girl is a novice, what does that make me????? A 4 year old?
She is no novice IMO. So dialed in.
ai expert is not an expert in chess
There's no way that 8 year old was a complete novice - she's already referring to squares by their reference positions!
"The rooook"
shouldn't Tani be explaining chess to Gothamchess' level tho?
GOTHAM I LOVE YOUUUU
My love❤
Part with Irina was really great! She was interesting, genuine, fun, smiling a lot. Loved her personality.
LEVYYYYY!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Levy caked up rn
“Chess Expert” sub 2200. Hmm🤔
If that kid is a beginner then I’m unborn 💀
Loved this one.
degenerates untie!
Wow what a nice video, learned alot, thanks Gotham, and wired.   Always looking forward to a Gotham video ❤
Bro i have 2100 elo, u cant explain me shi
why bro look AI generated in this one?
Levy never fails to lose against kids
levy never fails to appear on wired channel
is that a filter or levy suddenly looking chinese
When levy gets out of his house, you HAVE to take all the interviews  you want to
Im definitely a 2
Teach kids chess, not gender ideology
Levy smiled when the 8yo answered the question about the 2nd position because his viewers probably couldnt answer it as eloquently as she did😂
They really brought Tani here. Lewy is still thinking about all those losses to him 😭
Levy never fails to be on wired
This dude is such a toxic tool.
Bruuuh did they put makeup on your face you seem a little not gotham
I love these Gothamchess and WIRED crossovers. It’s also great seeing Tani in this video.
Featuring so many of NYC's finest!  I really appreciated that you showed the blitz games with Tani and Irina.  I think you should show the guests playing blitz chess in future episodes, even if the episode isn't about chess...
there's a blatant lack of "Levy never fails to" comments in here rn
Something is different with your face… make-up?
Levy sharing the love of the game to the world <3
Still majorly confused but I appreciate the attempt lol
Levy on Wired: Literal chess professor   Levy on his own channel: THE ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOK, THE MAGHNUSSSSSSSSS AND HIKARUUUUUUUUUU
Levy got her with that stare 💀
He is not a pro. He's only an IM cause he is to bad to become a GM
8 yo is better than me
I love gm krush she’s a legend
I’m honestly impressed with Novice. She seems more experienced than most newcomers I’ve played.
Where is Nakamura?
The name of the opening that levy plays against the grandmaster is called the ''classical'' dutch defense
29:40 Didn't know David Goggins do chess now 💀
Why not try Qc6?
Very unpleasant character …
@GothamChess is the GOAT communicator.
That was a treat
It's bizarre to see Levy talking so calmly, like his mom is watching
Levy is a gift to society :)
:)
I like how Gotham Chess listened when the grandmaster explained the game. Levy is no slouch but his face: "There is so much to learn".
Yesssss Gotham deserves this
the game against the Fide master kid was nice. At first I thought the kid got lucky. Then I noticed, luck had little to do with it. The rook was precisely where he needed it to be.
Pretty sure I spent more time watching YouTube ads than watching the actual video. Great video though!
Levy never fails to look gorgeous
Why is he wearing makeup
Levy looks weird without his classic dark circles under his eyes.
I'm not sure you know what the word "novice" means, but I think that's a good thing because having a complete novice would probably be a lot less interesting
I'm surprised Levi didn't teach us how to sacrifice the Rooooook!
Bruh... Level 6: Hikaru telling Levi everything he said was wrong 💀
Levy working overtime 💀💀, someone check on him
Level 6 - Magnus Carlsen
Nice video
what have they done to his face??? who is the makeup artist? oh poor levy
Why is she refered to as novice, like, she would probably crush me
That is novice!?
I thought Time Space and Harmony was a Krush original, who's her coach?
8 years old indian player would crush me
most boring so far by wired
Videos never fails to chess in his Levys
levy never fails to lose
Levy never fails to appear in a WIRED video.
Nice, Wired did invite him back as I demanded. Your welcome, Gotham. I take all the credit lol
NOVICE?????
"Chess Pro"
THAT NOVICE PLAYER IS BETTER THAN ME
I can’t look at Levy being so tolerant when the clip where he jumps on his chair pops up in my head
Great collaboration!
Levy’s face looks so smooth
Why is levy lookin HD in this video(idk how to explain it)
Levy never fails to be instructive
Im surprised they ended w an Ai expert, and not a chess expert
all games doesn't age , good luck chess 0/4000 chess quiz😆
Good science, thanks for sharing/producing.
That kid is hella smart
bro why does it say "chess pro" its clearly not
the 8yo kid is amazing. OMG. "A novice"? What I am then, an amoeba?
The last level would be Levy fist fighting with Magnus
Levy never fails to beat an 8 year old at chess
Levi exactly the type of guy to do a video where he is “teaching” and then get promptly beat by a child lol
I remember this make up in one of your videos. Key memory :D
that 8yo knew more than a normal 8yo lol
Why was the AI expert the top level? Dude isn't stockfish.
Levy they did not make you wear makeup my man! come oooon bro, thats some 600 elo ooga
Currently following Levy's CC course. And I was like c5,c5,c5!
When Levy said he loves chaotic positions and proceeded to play the Dutch Defense, it spoke to my soul.
I've played chess for years and I feel that little girl at the beguinning has more aknowledgement
I just loved how Levy started off with Riyae, asking how SHE'D explain chess to someone. And Riyae did a great job explaining it, too!
Why no “ooga booga”?
This guy's pretty good, he should take up private tutoring.
Your talent shines through in every detail.
5 levels huh? Why is the first girl better than me? Am i below level 1?  (Yes)
bruhh, what is this make up they put on him. 😭😭😭
Great video, but what's wrong with your face levi?
pretty sure that girl would absolutely rinse me lol
lol you can tell how Levy used to teach chess. Very informative
That kid would obilirate me.
Where is the chess pro??
Hello
I feel like the term "Novice" is being applied quite loosely here.
bro what is that makeup man
Levy is so zesty here
Guessing that 8 year old could quietly wipe the board with me 🥲
you lost to 13 y.o. Nice one Levy. Now it's our turn to laugh
level 1 was insane bro wdym
Loved this.
Levy never fails to promote small channels
Keep up the Collab's Wired.
Nice to see Levy breaking the bubbles and bringing chess to the masses.
they shoudda brought magnus and then we can watch levy teach chess to magnus
9:38 levy forgot jose capblache
Never seen levy this calm
This first interaction was super wholesome, I love seeing Levy in a teaching role like this. The girl is a great listener and wasn't shy about her ideas!
Can plz someone acknowledge the fact that "fianchetto" is pronounced with a strong C like in "character", not "charge"? It's painful enough hearing "porchetta" being pronounced like that even if the word "pork", that shares the same root, is not. 🥲
Am I the only 600 who started watching with the hope of becoming a 2000 by the end of this video?! 😅
Levy never fails, etc…
That kid is better at chess than me 😅
The first girl was a pro for sure! She really had the right mindset.
Yassified Levy
Nah bruh what kinda make up they got him wearing
Like Irina adviced, I guess we would all love to see Levi grind for GM title even if he uploads half the amount of videos, for I guess he would become the most wholesome, funny and informative GM.
Levy never fails to include wired in his videos
His fourth time on WIRED?
Levy never fails to appear in chess videos! Truly remarkable!
Levy speaking to a young person is eye-opening.
I love seeing Tani, such a fun and brilliant kid
The fact the novice uses a lot of terminology means they should have gone for someone else. Someone who literally only knows what pieces do and probably doesn't know en passant.
It's so sad to hear that a tv show inspired people to play chess when there's a real version of Beth called Magnus Carlsen who is 100 times more interesting and has inspired many with his amazing games.
i bet that little novice girl could wipe the floor with me in a 10-minute match! she was able to tell her plan using chess notation really quick
I like that the learning curve isn't tied to the age.
no no no... u should have done this looong back in summer 2022. WIRED you guys are way too late....
I always pronounced it as weird until I realized it's Wired
I liked seeing the games but another version of this could have just talked about the game and how they approach it. I wonder if the games were lost on folks who haven't started to play yet?  Please feature Gotham more
Levy never fails to include WIRED in his videos
They should’ve used Frank as the beginner
Amazing episode! I love this new idea about where AI chess can go. Imagine if I can say, I'm a 1000 and I want to practice my London against an aggressive 1400 player.
This is a good video for every level! With this you can understand how everyone thinks
Levy got mangled in that endgame vs the GM.
Good to know a novice level chess player would demolish me.
NGL, the Novice kid seems like she could probably beat Intermediate.
Is this why we don't have a Gotham Chess video today?
An IM explains chess to a GM. You cannot make it up.
Gotta say, i barely play chess, but because of queens gambit and @gothamchess exposing dewakipas few years back, i can see more and more people playing chess in my neighborhood here in indonesia. Props to him man
We love these videos with Levy, Wired, keep them coming!
Why does he look like Micheal Jackson?
what is wrong with his eyebrows ?
Now explain it to me like I’m at 4 year old… 😅
I'm here for Hans' Level  6 Chess Engine.  😁😁
Irina was such a delight! Levi and her had great chemistry. Hope to see them collab more
God bless Levy for bringing chess to us mortals
Levy never fails to mention chess in his videos.
I can't get over that makeup🤣
Why is the first girl talking like a GM? She is like 3
The 8 year old is a better player than I am
Pfft, what chess expert? At 7:32 he thinks he can move both rooks at the same time… J/k, love me some levy!
Wow!!!
That girl knew more than she shows
I love how Levy is down a full minute at one point vs the Grandmaster while he was on par with time against Tani. That more than anything shows you the true difference between levels lol
They should really bring a novice for the novice portion of the video. That girl has quite a lot of experience in chess I would say.
You know he’s mad about that loss 😂 Great game tho
They put so much makeup on Levy
what chess pro??😒🤣 call magnus or hikaru🫤
Let's go, more levy content.
Always amazing that Levi lets wired be in one of hus videos.
11:43 what happened here?
Levy is such a wholesome person. The world needs more people like this
In that first segment, you can see just how good Levi was at coaching young players before he quit doing that to focus on becoming popular on YouTube.
Why bro is all over my recommendation!!
You can really see Levy's experience with chess education in the first clip - he makes it so approachable, and he's validating all of her thought processes, while scaffolding to ease her into new realizations. Lovely to see.
The makeup people have done him dirty
21:13 "So you actually play the Dutch". At this point in this game, this position has been reached at least 15,000 times on Lichess alone.   22:13 "yeah this is nice and boring" at this point, still nearly 200 games in this position.   22:58 and as of move 14, we have a completely new game
5 levels of difficulty, me - :) video starts at level 3, me :|
Gotham City is based on Chicago. Your name is Gotham Chess, you live in NYC.
The novice girl doesn't seem very novice.
I'm thankful for Levy, he helped me beat my dad  In chess, ofc
this food blogger knows his chess
Levy is such a fantastic interviewer in this video! Love it
Now I do like Levy and it is obvious why he’s chosen for WIRED’s videos. However, it is funny how the top GM’s aren’t the ones who are chosen for these videos. Most likely a rare phenomenon in any field. Speaks to Levy’s content creation abilities.
The "novice" is way ahead of the curve.
The 8 year old knows more than me 😭
Oh boy that Caro Kan move helps me out, i've been in that situation and was struggling!
After Levy played b6 against Irina why could she just take his rook?
that child is a genius idk the first thing about chess lol
Should of had hikru
Irina is right about harmony trumping everything.  Sometimes  your pieces just start  working together on both sides of the board, and  you don't even have to look for the moves they just come to you intuitively.  The players at the very top level of the game  understand this better than most.  Chess really is a beautiful  game.
I hope the first goes running with that private lesson and becomes a grandmaster herself.
Level 6 should be Mittens
Um... is there a level below novice? This novice chat with the girl 30 years younger than me is already over my head.
Wow, Levy…I saw him on PBSNews Hour recently.
That little novice is no novice 😂 WIRED, hmu next time you need a real chess dummy
First girl was absolutely amazing.  I wouldn’t be surprised if we see her as a chess professional in a few years
The little girl knows more than most of us watching probably
Why is an AI programmer level 5?
I never watch these videos anymore… I don’t think WIRED understands what a novice is
love levyy and his chess vids! good one wired
There were much better players to feature in this than Gotham chess
I like how Levy explains chess to an 8 year old in a more sophisticated way than he does to his viewers.
this comment section is amazing and awful all at the same time
Wait a sec, Levy hasn't been a pro chess player for years.
Levy is more active in WIRED than GothamChess atp
who is this handsome fella
Wired never fails to put Levy in their videos
How many ads can you put in one video jesus
Imagine he taught chat like this
They keep snatching up levy 🗿
I like when levy posts videos on this second channel of his
The first girl is so smart, its amazing to see how kids think in chess
5:36 "Everything you said is 100% accurate (just like Hans Niemann)"
I think you missed a very good oportunity to add a digital board on the edtition, so everyone can understand what moves are being mentioned. It is also easier to see the board that way.
"I try to use AI to understand human behavior" with this one sentence this guys just became one of the most interesting people on this planet to me.
Ugh. There are other chess pros.
A lot of these explanations are worth gold for fresher players, great video!
The 8 year old has a more sophisticated understanding of chess than I ever will lmao
Chess pro?? Yes definitely.but there were far better options.  Fun fact- he did not explain. They explained to him after level 3. 😂
I'm levy... but you may know me as THE ROOOK!!
Wired used makeup to unlock Fabulous Levy!😂
It is just me or Levy’s face looks weirdly unnatural in this video?
anyone here thinks that levy took it easy with the GM woman bc he wanted to let her win ? that rook sacrifice looks sus idk
I Love these Wired videos with Levi they are so entertaining!
It's weird seeing levy so serious 😅
Jew
Why doesn't Irina take the rook with the bishop on a8 at 24'39?
As an Intermediate, I can confirm I am now a GrandMaster
no "levy never fails to" jokes in comment section? sad
Crazily, after all these years, the opening segment illuminated the difference between strategies and tactics in the best way possible.
Level 6: Magnus Carlsen
WIRED try not to cut for more than three seconds challenge: impossible
That young girl is gonna be a WFM in a couple years. She was not a novice😂😂
In case it wasn't too clear in level 3, at first Black has the initiative, using the pawns to take space, arranging the pieces to attack, then advancing. Then White is able to defend, and creates some of their own initiative. Attacking the vulnerable pieces, advancing the pawn, making the threat of promotion, using the rook to check the king and make more space for the pawn to advance, so White was able to transform the initiative and win the game.
Love this, Levy is absolutely amazing at clearly explaining chess concepts! :D
Ahh levy again at wired video
Makeup Levy isn't real, he cannot hurt you Makeup Levy:
Our GOAT @GothamChess!!!
That is not a novice that's a young talented chess player..
Lolll the first girl would destroy 80% of us 😂😂😂
As an AI I am very grateful to be explained by the person who programmed me.
That novice was seriously impressive!
Great video, nice to see different types of people's perspective on the game on different levels. Levy was a great host and asked really interesting questions..
If she’s a novice I’m a GM
Make up did him dirty 😂😂😂😂
Levy. Stop messing around and go get GM.
I see a wired chess video and I expect Levy. I'm never disappointed.
This is Levy’s channel now
Where is magnus Carlsen though?
Chess never fails to include Levy in WIRED's videos
levy probably would've yelled  "kid, you missed THEEE ROOOOOK" at 0:34 which would've been edited out
Thank you for including Irina. She's a good competitor and teacher.
Levy doesn’t ever not fail to never disappoint
Eh...Chess "Pro" is a little generous don't you think? 😅
I also like how Levy is so humble and respectful in these videos but on stream, he is just a totally different beast.
I was lucky enough to have started playing in Middle school when one of the kids would be In the cafeteria in the mornings had a Chess set he would bring and actually taught me how to move the pieces.... I'm proud to say Chess has been my favorite game ever since
Levy's right hand partially disappears at 2:39 :))
she aint no novice LOL
What's with Goffam's eyes?
This guy owns wired
Yo Gotham's hand has a hole at 2:40 what the heck
25:29 why didint she pin the queen with the bishop
So sweet to see gotham talkig with that girl n not calling her you absolute bozo
WIRED never fails to feature Levy in their videos
The 'novice' is good enough to have her own channel!
Levy is trying his hard to hold the urge to talk about Magnus Carlsen
why did bro have so much makeup?
Levy is one of the chess players of all time
I love Chess Wired videos
Levy been here a lot now!
Levy talking chess with the little girl was so wholesome
You guys need to fix his makeup if he ever does this again
I m very impressed with little one she is amazing <3
Now I understand the make up Levy had on his channel video..😂
Now that is a world record for most wired apperences. Congrats Levy!
Total novice who knows what a skewer is, sure 😅
Levy is our hero ❤❤
8 year old smarter than me 😂
Should have included a total novice, this talented 8-year-old was definitely over 1000. Quite the high entry level.
Wired milks Levy for views like how Levy milks Magnus for views lmaooo
"Chess pro" is a bit of a stretch
they should have introduced each level up by a younger player
that chess baby is smart and too adorable
level 6: Gotham level
Irina Krush is bad asf
Nice to see Tani. Haven't seen him in a couple of years and like they say kids grow up fast.
Levy is so nice to let WIRED be featured in his video
Thanks to the 🐐
It's always such an entertaining video when you have Levy on it tbh
There is no better way to start a season than having a chess related video with GothamChess, one of the best types of content there can be.
Gotham really doing all the side quests and I’m here for it
That 8yr old girl has more IQ that an average student.That’s what chess are familiar for
Wired never fails to put gotham in their videos
I love how Levy is becoming a Wired regular
Isn't it crazy that his last name is chess?
I wasn't expecting seeing Irina krush,  I really love her playing style
Chess is a healthy habit in my opinion
79th!!!
This channel might as well be called Wired - GothamChess. Lets go big babies.
He’s always on here 💀💀
I love the fact that it's Levy who is the face of chess! You are the living reminder that following your passion is always an option in this world - thank you so much for being such an inspiration!
Wow I got here fast
I could watch Levy play chess with Riyae for literal hours 😁
What shocked me the most was that the Asian guy didn't come last
Levy never fails to make my day worse even if it is someone else's channel
"What's good about chess?" Levy: *e4*
that girl is more intelligent than like 80% of the world
Good to see Levi doing so well.
Lvl 6 : Guess The Elo
chess is great, they should teach it in schools, it promotes lots of good thinking skills
Levy never fails to reduce chess to us
It’s funny how the beginner is better than the intermediate in elo.
Wow. I don't remember the last Pro Explainer video where the age went back down between skill levels.
To The Record To Most Wired Man
Level 6: GTE ft. Hikaura Nakamura
Nah he's not a chess pro, more of just an aficionado of it
Is Levy Wearing Makeup?
My 700 ELO brain has been enlightened.
Not even half the player Magnus is. Joke.
If that girl is level 1 then we are missing a level 0
Common, the first girl was the intermediate and the dude after is the beginner xdxd
wired never fails to put levy in a video
He sacrificed.....HIS ROOOOOOKKKKK!!!!!
This girl is a NOVICE!?
*He sacrifices...*
Levy's make-up 💅🏽🔥
he's pretty good at talking about chess, maybe he can make his own youtube channel or become a GM someday
Thank you, WIRED. Always a pleasure :)
Does Levy have makeup on? Where are the dark circles?
okay so I just learned I'm worse than novice. Good. There's a start for me too i guess lol
First girl was amazing at showing her thought process, and props to Levy for knowing how to come across to each audience well.
it would be funnier if the lvls of difficulty were inversely proportional to age. the last guest being an 8 y/o gm.
I'm always happy to see Levy doing so well, this man has got an unmatched dedication to his craft and he 100% deserves all the good things happening to him right now!
Levy
Levy is so passionate
So happy for Levy getting these opportunities.
I see Levy, I click Levy
I refuse to play chess, not because I think I’m too good for it. It’s because I know some little kid will absolutely stomp me in public
Ayo, is Levy a part of Wired now? lmao
It's spelt Knight not Night
These collaborations with Levy are great! Keep it up, WIRED!
It's nice to see the guy who knows how to sacrifice his rooks come back to this channel!
Strange that a IM explains something to a GM
I am inspired
Another wired and Levy's collab, good for me
Is gothamchess wearing make-up
Surprise of a surprise I've got in a while.
WIRED is Levy's second channel at this point
pin of fame
wow!
Second
Second
Level 6: Guess the rating
first
