yess
United are the saddest club other than spurs
cool
cool
Who is that kid co-commentating?
Please give us a ‘mute commentary’ button 🙏 I can see what’s happening, no need to explain
Who was the female commentator on this game?
Is that a child commentating sounds like my 4 year old niece
Newcastle will not be easy
Martial is not the answer
Great defending by Sturridge for Man U
Garnacho is so good man.
Bruno is different class such vision
God, Im so happy that Martial is back. Him and Rashford together are better than York and Ince. What a duo. With Sancho back in the mix we have a three capable of beating any team. Lets see how Barcelona works out now.
The reds are back!!!!! 🔥
Bruno made that cross look so easy🥶
I am a Liverpool fan and as much as it pains me to see United do well  with my England hat on Rashfords form is very exciting.
They made it all this way to get hammered of the TOON in the final . They are on their last legs now , and they know this is probably the last chance they have of winning anything
get rid of these irrelavent women please for the love of god
Us men let women infiltrate the commentary so have nothing to blame but ourselves. Next step mixed teams and the death of the game
I am a Cov City fan, I think I can safely say that Man Utd are back on track, now they have rid of drama queens who think they are bigger than the club! I think United will now give Arsenal a real challenge to the title, could end up on goal difference. City playing catch-up?
Marcus and Garnacho are class. But United will lose in the final.
Kinda ruined it for me knowing the result beforehand, not all of us have Sky Sports!
I thought it was a 12 year old boy commentating till I realised it was a women
The quota tick commentator, who no one has heard of, was so bad I had to watch the game with the sound off.  Sky Sports, BT Sports, Talk sport, plus ITV and BBC Sport are just infested with woke agenda driven crap.  In the end I will get rid of my Sky Sports as it seems men can't have anything to themselves nowadays.
Commentary 😅
Forrest signing all these players and defend like that. Shocking
I don’t care one bit if the commentators a woman, i embrace it, but get rid of that co commentator who sounds like a 10 year old boy who knows nothing, there’s so many better options
Man U is beating Newcastle
That co commentator was basically a female Michael Owen
The commentary 💀💀
Grown men getting mad at women commentators. You love to see it.
Wow who is the diversity hire they got commenting there, absolutely terrible
Is that Co-Commentator a Parrot?
rashford is terrible
Good save by surridge for Man U 😂 👏
How is this women still comemtating feels like every game she is worse than the usual commentators
Quote, it’s a good shot from Anthony, it could of been buried in the top corner that. It could of hit the post, it could of gone wide, it could of hit the keeper in the gonads
worst commentary ever
No offence but women should commentate on womens football and mens on mens no sexist just right
wow that women on commentary was awful made Michael Owen sound good at his job, need to stop this box ticking and get people who are good at the job
That co commentator has to be one of the worst ive ever seen
Bruno not celebrating martials goal just shows he ain't a team player, he was crying inside he didn't get the ball, just look at his reaction on the replay
nice goal martial good player
Manchester United 🔴⚪️⚫️👹👺⚽️🏆 going to Wembley
NPC reporter
Who’s emptying the bins whilst all this is going on
The over lapping commentary is annoying its telling you whats going on but virtually a forced response very rigid from the lady
Man u are go down next week
On 2nd goal, Fred is like "do I really need to do this?" 😂😂😂
Female commentary is one of the worse things to happen to football
Co commentator making Micheal Owen’s attempts seem insightful 😂😂
Haha brilliant commentary! Sounds like a NPC on a side quest
Someone sack that commentator…typical women logic
Martial out . Please.
0:22  Anthony strike was fire 🔥 power
Why is there a child commentating? Is this another woke agenda appointment?
game ruined by female woke sky comentator
ten hag and cas just got here and they in a final already. someone said this league was tough💀
I think theres a parrot in the gantry
Why is Horrid Henry commentating?
Awful refereeing week in, week out and terrible commentary on extorsionately premium sky sports...what is the point anymore. Love for the game is dwindling
That commentary was so annoying just repeating what’s the bloke said the whole game I actually had to turn it down she kept talking as if it was 0-0 when we was already 3-0 up
That Co commentator was shocking
Who on earth is this female "commentator" all she does is repeat what we've just seen, does she think we are stupid?...get het to f-ck off this channel or I will never watch it again. Commentators should be picked because of their ability and not because they are female which we are finding more and more in the media, the feminists are talking over the MSM.
It honestly has nothing to do with her being a woman, but that commentating was terrible.
i checked twitter at half time to see if it was just me surprised by the commentary turns out she was #3 trending at one point🤣🤣
Was there a parrot sat on the commentators shoulder during that game ?
Considering where Nottingham Forest were this time last year, I’m so proud of my club! Our defence was very good in the first half of this game but the defending in the second half & at the city ground was awful, doesn’t help that our players are dropping like flys. Our attack over both games has been decent as well, just need to score
was it bring your kid to work day?
amazing game in curacao coca cola cup. What next? Champions league final? xd
Why force women commentators? It really doesnt work.
Bro this co commentator man, absolutely trash
who's the little kid commentating?
There should be options of who the commentary is
Who's the female Gary Neville commentating
Who is the female commentator? She literally adds nothing to the coverage, other than parroting the things that her commentating partner has literally just said.
I’m sure Izzy is a great person and she was a decent footballer but she should probably put the microphone down.
Martial is actually so washed, he tried his best to ruin the attack for their first goal, what an atrocious pass to Rashford, they should try and get some money for him now before everyone realises quite how tragic a player he is
She was hands down the worst co commentator ever
Lol this is embarrassing from sky. No personality just a parrot. But we will be classed as evil because she has a vagina
Whats happening to reffs recently, do they all lie on their CVs when they apply?
0:06 - 0:17 why is the commentary so funny 😂
I'm not sexist in the slightest but when watching football I want to hear the opinions of ex players who have actually been in a winning team for the men's game and have experienced being in a winning dressing room and can draw on their experiences in those situations. Last nights co commentators opinion meant absolutely nothing, sky may as well just get a fan off the terraces  into the com box and get their view on the game.
Bruno is insane
Pure luck
Nottingham has helped Man United to stay on top four, thank you
Brennan Johnson is not making many one word jibes after getting hammered by Man Utd on both occasions :-) :-) loving it  Derby Fan ..................
How can you sit there with a straight face and say the co commentator has her job on merit?
For people saying the co-commentator was bad (which she was), just remember what Michael Owen was like when he started...
Co-commentary was Partridge level.
Please sack that commentator she was terrible , made the game hard to watch with the sound on !
That female commentator wants sacking , her comments about Casemiro last night were shocking  and she sounded like a parrot pretty much repeating what other commentators said. Get your own  game 👃👃
It was only Forrest  who they played easy team there gonna get done by Newcastle at Wembley 😂
The co-commentator was constantly slating 18 year old garnacho, she needs the boot
Glad they turned her mike off half way through lol
This match is the exact reason why girls shouldn’t commentate a football match
commentators are doing my head in, surely they should be able to offer the game without commentators, NO, i dont want to mute it, i want to hear the crowd and potentially the players/managers shouting
Had to turn the sound off. Woke culture gone mad.
Top tier commentating from the bint once again
“It was aateth- it was a certain goal had it not hit the legs of surridge”  Goalkeeper and defender both diving towards the shot  🥴
The co commentaror praising NF for not pressing united and sitting back, being compact. Completely forgetting Utd were 3 0 up. Even my own missus picked up on that. 🤭🤷
superb incisive co commentary, she should go far..........
The officiating needs questioning again. How was Johnson not sent off and how did Man Utd not get at least one penalty is beyond me. The refs hate Man Utd
who let this woman commentate 😂😂😂
Please no more Andy hinchcliffe and izzy christansen for Manchester United games, the commentary was appalling especially when izzy is talking about an 18 Yr old kid who has just started playing saying he needs to be more consistent now the lad has assists and goals and then questioning casemiros commitment and the way he plays, also when neco Williams is deliberately pulling on garnachos shirt because he went past him and she says I quote "good defending" and having Andy hinchliffe ex city player who rarely comes on sky, people pay a fortune for your subscriptions just don't have them on any games very amateur and just slagging united off
Hope Newcastle win the final been very long time man united have won plenty over the years don’t won’t them to win it come on Newcastle all the best from wolves fan.
That voice!  Had to have it on mute. Was like listening to my 8 year old whine. Dad, can I have...
The women has no idea honestly.
Who's the co commentator? Michelle Owen.
It was like listening to Michael Owen commentate for most it, all she did was repeat the other commentary and state the absolute obvious. Typical PC nonsense her being there
Just want to give the ref a mention for yet another terrible performance. Scarpa makes 20 fouls half of which we’re sliding lunges and he didn’t even get booked and Weghorst should of had the most blatant pen you’ll ever see nd VAR said na you alright.
I was watching the match live and just as martial scored the WiFi went off 😭
Were so good
Martial & Fred steer Utd to Wembley! | Man Utd 2-0 Nottingham Forest | Carabao Cup Highlights    2.2.23  0751am   no way forest were gonna come back from that first leg score...
Worst commentary iv heard in a while.
awful pass to Rashford from martial
Commentary was shambolic, please never again Sky.  Good game spoiled by terrible commentary.
Women, know your limits
Bruno Fernandez's pass with the outside of hIs  boot is just RIDICULOUSLY....  ..good
i reallly struggle with female commentators
Rashford channeling the Pele in him. 🎉🎉
Manchester United now I strong team💪
If that young parrot can get a job, there's hope for everyone.
Are female commentators just going to be the norm now? I thought it was a few here and there. They're everywhere now. Can't stand 'em.
Never heard a co-commentator speak so much 🤣 she's giving Gary Neville a run for his money for talking so much
Come on Newcastle please shut diveChester United up
Martial is terrible need to get rid, that pass to rashford before his goal was Sunday league, can’t header, always injured…
meanwhile another week goes by and Mr J Sancho picks up another outrageous wage and what does he give back for such handsome generosity ? SWEET FA as usual !
Good result… but let’s be honest; there are not going to any impartial fans supporting Man U in the final.😂
Absolutely the worst commentating on a match ever.  And I remember the heady days of Guy Mowbray and Mark Lawrenson for the BBC.  Truly, truly terrible
Sky will you stop using a total of 3 commentators for a match. It is too much and totally unnecessary
That save with his feet was great while it was pathetic.  Her saying it was a certain goal if not for the block by his own teammate while there was two players and a goalie on the goal line.  Sometimes it’s better to say nothing and there is no life in her voice ether.
Look how excited uniteds litttle faces am that there in the Mickey Mouse cup final.. bless
The worst commentator I've ever heard . But suppose Sky ticked another box . Don't worry, that her monotone voice the worst, or she offers an amateur take on a professional game . 🔇 🔕 🔇
Another win means nobody talks about the blatant refereeing corruption yet again.
5-star performance...on aggregate that is!!
Why tf is she commentating? Painful to listen to it needs to stop
iove mun united
Who's the female commentator ffs  ? Absolute crap ! This is what happens when boxes have to be ticked. Shameful   !
Fred again
Way to easy for utd playing against championship side
Co commentator ruined the game for me
Bird on comms. Had to press mute.
The commentary was extremely confusing, I remember at one point that a forest player shot and it hit thier own player and she said it was good defending. Her mind must of been in the kitchen (sorry politically correct police).
Did anyone else notice the commentary by the women stopped after a short time, thank god.
Anyone realised that she said Man City when Antony strike the ball???
The female commentator is like someone making her own essay but actually just found an existing good one, and just reworded it and sounded exactly like the original.
I may be a bit drunk but Rashford is the best player in the world
She’s really commenting the utter basics wasn’t needed
Female commentator really commenting absolutely nothing she just had to speak to remind people she’s there
Rashford's always had talent just never had a coach who ever bothered to try and improve him
The co-commentator was shambolic 😂 just repeating everything that was said prior
Basically the female Michael Owen
Sorry but what is she adding to the commentary, absolutely no ball knowledge my little sister could commentate better than that and she’s not even 8 yet
How come there was no highlight for Johnson’s first half chance that “he had to score” x3?
Second commentator is just miss obvious. Really jarring
Commentary AWFUL
Really bad commentary team
2  of the cheesiest goals I've ever seen. Going to drop in the league without erikson. The best thing to happen to utd since fergie left
The commentary was sublime, the co commentator was entertaining😉😂
Commentary like a comic book writer
That woman just talking a load of rubbish ffs at least get someone who knows football
You can tell keane respects ETH. He knows after several bad calls they may have a manager who can get utd competing again.
Commentator was doing my head in bad to turn it off
💯 Quaresma trivela ⚽️
Nice defending by Weghorst 🥴 poor commentating tonight
Man Utd v Newcastle in a cup final is all I ever wanted to see, and screams of historic and untapped nostalgia.  Both teams have been struggling hard in recent seasons but for at least one, this season is finally gonna bring success!
God someone fire that second commentator.
"ETH ball suffocates forest in 10 goal thriller at Old Traf-" .... oh wait nvm
Yesss were in the final!! Get in United!!
Dear me I had to mute the commentary WTF🙄
Not about being a woman or not but that co commentary was awful.   If you got nothing decent to say… don’t say anything at all
Twats
0:12    0:27     0:43    Thank's for stating the obvious i would have struggled without that input 👍🏻
Nottingham has so many gk Henderson hennasey Navas I feel sorry for samba bought up up to prem and don’t even get to experience the prem
Completely different team without Ronaldo.
That women on commentary 😂😂😂fluked her way completely into this job
Rashford with a pass that Fred couldn't miss even if (and it seems like he did🤣) tried.
who put a parrot on co commentary own up
“Could’ve been buried into the top corner that”😂 could you not literally say that about any kick…
Is the female cometature watching a different game tonight?
That voice wsl not got any games on this weekend
Holyshit where did you find miss squeaky adds nothing states the obvious.
Bro is she really getting paid for this commentary 💀
We want equality. Oh so you want equal opportunities? Nice.   Well no I want to be employed under the guise of equality and stink the commentator booth out with drivel and shite all game.
Good game but the refereeing was woeful.
Jeez is that a 5 year old on the commentary or what?
Never want to hear these commentators ever again.
The atmosphere at Old Trafford is pathetic compared to St James Park 🤣
newcastle will stuff yanited in the final...
Please Sky don't ever bring that woman back on commentary again.
SKY NEVER LET IZZY CHRISTIENSEN COMMENTATE EVER AGAIN. ABSOLUTELY ABYSMAL
That outside foot pass by Bruno to Rashford, beautiful.
Look how disappointed Bruno was that he didn’t get the goal  at 1:21 😂😂😂😂 selfish guy
Not one highlight of the referees poor performance what a surprise
Is that a bloke and a 10 year old boy commentating? The boy was awful.
Great to see Sancho back 😍
0:12 wtf 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That Izzy Christiansen is by far the worst pundit in the entire history of Sky sports. She won't use one word if she can use one thousand words instead, she completely ruined the game tonight with the constant nonsensical diatribe regarding some of the play.  She's like the female Gary Neville, other than the fact I actually quite like the insights that GNev offfers.   God help them if they ever end up in the same room, they'd run out of oxygen.
I want women commentators because some people get angry.
That female commentator was an utter embarrassment for women in football and showed huge bias against United. Her voice is not good for commentary at all. Her insight offered nothing,  just waffled on and went crazy for anything slightly positive Forest managed to pull off. Sort it out Sky, it ruined the game.
What a team. Since the GOAT has gone. Ten Hag and the lads have totally excelled for the purpose.
Who let Horrid Henry co commentate this game
who the hell is that female commentator? don't ever put her on a utd game a again. half the time she was bias against utd the other half she was just parroting the other commentator smh
Martial scores a goal ; now he'll be wrapped in bandages for 6 months with bruised toe nails.
Women commentators. What are they like?
That Co-Commentator is painful to listen too like playing fifa in 90's
The commentator was having a go at young Garnacho for being "no end product". Babe, shut up.
The comments from the "commentator" after the goal cracked me up. What on earth was she talking about.
King BRUNO👑 MOM!! Great to see Tony score hopefully gives him confidence after injury ⚽️
Bhh
Please don’t invite that daft cow back for the Final commentary! If you insist on having a 📦 ✅ on commentary at least make sure it’s a decent one. Thanks!
Hope Newcastle beat them in final
If Rashford gets injured United will struggle
Forced female co commentary to tick the box,its was horrific
Fred’s goal is the first I’ve seen in a while, maybe ever, where the goal AND assist was not done by either a foot or a head lol
Imagine a commentary team of this woman and Michael Owen
THE COMMENTARY IS JOKES🤣🤣
I think it's fair to say that Rashford is the hottest player in world football right now. No one is doing what he is doing right now. No one. At this moment right now, he is a £150m player. No question. The question is, will he be able to do this season after season. If he does, we will win the title and the champions league next season.
Terrible women commentator
Surprised ETH played Rashford and Bruno.
Well as from tomorrow, I'm applying for a job as a commentator, as it seems pretty easy to just copy everything else, that someone says 😜
Newcastle vs Manchester United should be a great match
Oh yes, 8 year old commentary is back 🤣
Why are they forcing diversity.... Just let the men commentate. It sounds so terrible with a woman's voice
Token commentator
Absolutely love the game timer, please leave it in Prem highlights I don't understand why no one does it
The worst commentary I've ever heard.
who the f*ck was that bird commentating? please don’t get her on ever again
What about when Weghoust hit the post??
How old is the female commentator she sounds like a 4 year old
what kind of highlight is this 1.57 ???  should do shorts in this case
Dreadful co-commentator put her in the bin please sky
Sky: listen to the your customers' comments re the diversity hire commentator...
Possibly the worst co-commentator I've ever heard 🤣
Dreadful co-commentary
Worse commentary I've ever heard for a football match
If Michael Owen was a female commentator.
Should be a good final!
As a Real fan, Man UTD should have been given 2 penalties. The ref is quite ridiculous
Erik Ten Hag's magic philosophy.
Good result.for Man United. Aberdeen FC used to win games also.
Why is no one talking about Casemiro's first time pass for Martial's goal? Pure class.
Need a stadium noise option, cannot stand modern day commentary
Martial & United fans is like Ross & Rachel from friends. Such a turbulent relationship. Injuries & Inconsistency have really ruined his United career, he had potential for SOOOO much more. I rated him higher than Rashford at one point
Stop over doing it with the female commentators ffs it ruins it for the decent ones
we need to win this final now
Will rashford keep this up and become the world class player we know he's capable of being... or is this just a run of good form that will eventually run out ... opinions 👀
woman commentator was atrocious
Brilliant commentary from the co commentator, just repeating every what the main commentator says lol.
WEMBLEY BOUND LOVE IT
Can’t stand horrid Henry the commentator she’s cringey.
the impact rashford made as soon as he came off the bench
The Ten Hag effect is going to give us trophies 🙂
I'm NOT sexist.... HONEST!!! BUT bloody hard to listen to a wee teenager girl commentating!!!!
Why does the commentary sound like it is from an early 2000's video game?
EtH = winning is a bi product of hard work and determination and team spirit
One of the worst refereeing performances I’ve ever seen. United’s rivals need to shut up about the Rashford goal against city now, coz since then, we haven’t been able to buy a decision in our favor
That women commentator just ruined the video.
The goal area in the stretford  end is starting to get lots of mud
Great to see the Notts Forest fans crying on TV 🌲🔥🤣
Rashford has been on fire since the world Cup, think he found his love for footy again 💥💯
I do hope Izzy doesn't do any more commentary. Boring one-sided bias. Let her cover a cricket match in future.  Who is she anyway.
Women offering an expert summary of every fcking replay for no worthwhile reason. It does my bloomin head in.
Garnacho needs to chill
The roar for sancho when he came on was heartwarming
The woman commentator done my head in.....not bcause shes female before yall start but genuinely spoke sh!t
get rid of women commetators pls
Seeing our 3 muskateers come on was beautiful
i adore this club
No one talking about Bruno’s pass…
Is Gemma Owen on commentary? Christ almighty...
Was great to see “The Three Amigos” come on together: - Martial was electric. - Rashford was very creative.  - Playing at no.10 might well be Sancho’s best position in the long run.
WEMBERLEEEEEE!!!!!! 🔥❤️🎵👹 Lovin it 😍
Going to be some final this. Actually cannot wait for this 💯
Horrid Henry 2.0
Co commentary was brutal
Was united playing Al nassr?
women comintators?
'That save from Hennesy was a great save with his feet' Cheers Geoff.   I was watching the game on the ESPN feed and the scottish fella co-commentating was going mad because he didnt just dive on it, which was spot on. Wasnt a great save at all.
Get Izzy Christiansen off commentary immediately Sky Sports.
I’m sorry but that’s got to be some of the most brain dead co-commentary I’ve ever heard…
Co-commentary was a shocker
How can Sky Sports be so lazy in choosing a commentator but tonight she was absolutely awful, hard to watch in some ways! Cmon Sky! Sort it out
The female commentator was awful. Talk about cliched and stating the obvious. Never mind quotas and all that!
1 minute video 😂
Fred so good now he scores without even shooting 🤣
Female commentary destroying the game. Where do they find these amateur commentators.
Why do they have an 8 year old on the commentary?
Your commentary teams are horrendous.
It will be interesting to see how Man.u infiltrate Newcastle defence.
Hope that co-commentator is a regular so she can repeat everything the main commentator says again. Thoroughly enjoyed that
Fml I swear United played them like 3 times in a single month and forest lost all three? Should have just forfeit the match
Nice to see they have the juniors commentating too
UTD WALKED TO THE FINAL FOREST OFFERED NOTHING MUCH
fred the goat man for real slice
Martial's goal shows why he cannot be a first team player. A total fluke, but worse than that, in the run up he had the SIMPLEST pass to Rashford to make and Rashy would have been clean through...and AM f***ed it up, like he always does with simple, basic stuff.
Was nice to see Man U actually score some goals finally instead of throwing themselves to the ground in the penalty area every chance they got. The Old Trafford crowd is also terrible, could only hear the Forest fans most of the match. On the positive side, the depth of the Man U squad is terrifying. Being able to bring on Rashford, Sancho and Martial in one swoop is impressivel. Man U have had some fantastic players for years, it just took the right man to get something out of them finally.
I've heard that mansplaining is a thing. Never heard of kidsplaining before
WEMBLEYYYYY
Ref was terrible 😡
Like a fing child commentating, sounds wrong man.
The commentary was bizarre tonight its like they kept forgetting we was 3-0 up😂
That woman commentator just adding her 2pence in, stay in kitchen love
Even at 40% energy,We controlled the game and it shows the gears we can now go up under these players and Ten Hag,Can’t wait to see this team with Marcel Sabitzer!
That has to be the LEAST amount of 'Added Time' at OT Ever!!!  And WHY must certain commentators be foisted on Football matches?
How’s she managed to bag a commentary job?
Mickey Mouse cup and don't understand all the excitement. I suppose it gives the smaller clubs a day out. 👍
why is a baby commentating?
Is it bring your kid to work day? Who’s that commentating?
My only frustration in this Jan window is Arsenal missing on Mudruyk. I swear that boy is the next world footballer of year. Edu was so naive not to make that signing early. We really missed a diamond😭😭😭
Women commentators 😴
It was better than I thought it was gonna go
Awesome co-commentary by the one and only captain obvious. Really insightful.
What's the female voice on the first three plays that just repeats what the commentator says and then disappears  for all The rest of the plays
Old rivalries resurfacing, it’s about time we got one over Man United.  One thing will be for certain, we’ll definitely out sing the prawn sandwich brigade.  ⚫️⚪️
12th game in a row we've won at Old Trafford the first time since 2011. Old Trafford is becoming a fortress once again. Plus we've now got the most clean sheets in Europe. What Ten Hag has done with this squad beggars belief. Through to our 1st final now let's go & win the thing. Also Great to see Martial & Sancho back who I thought looked very lively when he came on. I told people that Ten Hag will explore playing Sancho in the number 10 position & that's what he did. Ten Hag has admitted himself that Sancho is capable of playing in that position.
That commentary is awful.
That commentary “that save is a great save that” “ that shot could of gone in”
Dont let this commentator, commentate ever again
0:10 Lovely few bits of commentary
Fair play to Ten Haag for getting the best out of these United players, also his new signings have made a big impact aswell 👏.
Well done boys 🩸🩸🩸
Who was the split ass commentating? Ffs she was so biased against Manchester United the biggest club in the world.
Who cares wheres the rangers highlights 😊
Who was the co commentator. Bloody hell didn’t shut up
Ralf Rangnick made people doubt some of these United players last season. Ten Haag is now getting the best out of them, Rashford is a prime example.
She really is a female Michael Owen.
Come on Wembley we the famous man united
The female commentator was awful 😣
Eric Ten Haag is doing a very good job at Man United. He's addressed the issues they had last season and earlier this season aswell and he's got them playing some very good football 👏.
Welcome back Jadon Sancho!
Is that Jimmy krankie commentating?
Just clocked, Rashford had two assists in the 20mins he was on!  What a player
Man Utd a team vs forest b team 😂
Make sure you guys bin that Mickey Mouse sounding commentator
None of Forest's chances in the first 25 minutes shown...
I muted it soon as I heard the women waffling
Commentator was doing too much, as if she had to prove a point, like we get it you know your football just relax ffs😂
Why is my little brother co-commentating?!
Wembley, Wembley, we’re the famous Man United and we’re going to Wembley🩸 🎶
whats with the parrot
Take a bow ETH.  What a manager!
that woman commentator is brutal on the ears.
Bruno is a top top player, he's been consistent sincr 2017! He finally has world class players around him now at United, least he deserves for carrying them since he arrived
if i had a 6'5 striker id be playing it to his chest and head :) just saying
Newcastle needs to save the world
Rashfords consistency is beginning to show He’s developed well under ten hag and this season is just the start of prime rashford
Ref was atrocious
It was only Forest. Newcastle will be tough to get past with their defence.
sancho back
Goalkeeper makes an average save with his foot, women's like amazing save. 🙄
Bro that woman commentator should retire
Commentator sound like a 7r old
Bruno was class and great to see sancho back
United fans were calling this the Mickey Mouse cup last year by the way. What changed🫠
that commentary from the higher pitched voice is atrocious
Really hope martial can continue a good form, he’s too underrated
Why do we have to put up with such bad commentators? Completely ruins the game.
Were on our way to Wembley 🔴🔴⚽
Co-commentator sounds about 14
Some of the worst commentary I have ever heard....Bloody awful Sky....
Ref made some dodgey calls tbh. 2 forest players deserved sendings off and UTD deserved atleast 1 penalty.  However, still a cracking game and Garnacho shining through teams more than ti thought and a lot more confident and mature.
10 year old commentator is back again
In ETH we trust! 🤝🧏🏿🧏🏿🧏🏿🧏🏿🧏🏿🧏🏿
Ten Haag will get my respect when he wins us a Cup or a title simple as that.
Martial looked decent tbf hopefully he can keep that form up
Commentator is too high-pitched. Sounds like a little boy.
Hennessy isnt even league one quality
:D amazing ^^
Not going to lie, Im nervous like! Should be an interesting final 👊⚫️⚪️
Were of to wembly!!!! COME ON UNITED!!!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤
If McKenna did that tackle on Salah instead of Weghorst, not only would have it been given as a pen, but McKenna would get a red card along with it
New Era
Let's go Uniteddd. We've got this🔴
showing that rashford doesn’t only score goals, he assists too. what a player he’s turning into
360p??
I smell progress 😍😛 Wembley we are coming for you 🔴🔴⚽️
If you can't get VAR to give a stonewall penalty like that follow through kick on Weghorst's shin then what are they going to give? SMDH. Anyway, easy win for United. Great to be back in a Wembley Final.
COYR
ETH best manager for ManU   since Fergy
UNITED❤️
YANITED. YANITED. YANITED. 🔴
Ten hag army go marching in. 1 st silverware in the Ten hag era 🏆🔴
Bring ON Newcastle come on UNITED ❤❤
lesss gooo
