Maybe it would have been smarter to make them all out of lighter aluminum sheets
What did the middle one, with the curtains use as a base?
Do more of this bicycle trailers please. I liked the one in the middle the most. This has potential and I would have liked to see how he build it. Very nice curtains. Basically, all you need is a moskito net for the inside and a tarp in case it rains.
Who else thinks they should have jstu glow sticks idk why but ever sense the laugh daily glow stick shirts came out I have thought that 😂
OMG. So much wasted wood 😭 Would it be so hard to think of pipe frame with plywood floor and PVC canopy, held together by power of geometry and zip ties? Also, if you just had to build that wooden frame, why no one ditched the original frame to lower the center of gravity and moved the axle firther back to widen the wheelbase? I request an annual redo until at least one of you build something actually usable 🙏😅
Is this their “work space/shop” or do they all share this house?
Check out Steve Wallis’ “Hunker Down” bike camper. He used styrene and coroplast and it looks like a legit fifth wheel camper. Lights and all.
🙏4 more vids.
For future reference, you want the weight over the axles not towards the tongue.....
Very funny video 😅😅😅
Hi😊
I am the first person watching 5:50 while pooping on September 12th 2025 in Battle Creek Michigan I am the first one ever to do this
Jstu #jsqaud i like jstu
7:33this part just jumpscared me😂
If Isaac was doing lighter load build he should tried looking for a tarp, light more weather proof than other fabrics.
3:07 be fire
The edit of this was hilarious 😂😂😂 Edit: Loved Isaac's camp vibes 😂❤
Issac win indeed
W's for Isaac. lol
Like if they need to do this again but a 2 night camping
2025 anyone?
All bike camps are not rainproof. Need to find a covered place if it rains. 😅🍃🌧️⛈️
I like the donut bear t shirts
{I hate you.}
3:31 why such thick wood? 😅 I understand it needs to hold your weight and the weight of itself as well, but that’s just overkill lol, you guys should really research stuff before just jumping into it, I have been wanting to build something similar to this to pull behind my motorized bike but I plan to use much thinner wood and also a slightly different bike trailer, they make all metal ones that the sides fold down on and would make for a much better starting platform than whatever these seat trailer things are… still excited to see what you guys come up with though! Love watching you guys struggle though stuff and still just figuring it out and making stuff work 😂 I do the same thing, if something doesn’t work right then I make it work another way hahaha
good to see another Pipefitter
Should do a new video where you these kind of trailers for the E-bikes and camp over night where the first bikes battery goes empty.
NO!🪩💋🪩❤️🩷🧡💛💚💙🩵😇😶‍🌫️😊
oh yeah I forgot to say Hyper and Caleb are horrible to watch
If Andrew is 6'2 caleb must be 4'11
I love when Chris Griffin is in the videos
🔥
Editors...... you're brilliant!!
I can’t with y’all😂 from Justin’s bike falling and Issac stumbling over his bike at 1:49. Y’all crack me up
What. A . Joke. Commmooonnnn. do a roof top pop up style flat trailer. A bunch of poles set side by side to be used as tent poles. or some sort of trike with an aero dynamic extending culvert on the back.
A good way to make the camper small but still comfy to lay in would be a foldable ramp inside. The sides could’ve had foldable screens with some hinges too for extra length. Love seeing them build all these crazy things haha.
Mug of Isaac if you pause 13:55
Hey you guys Love your videos I was just wondering why you guys never use CVC pipe for anything especially this video I think that would have made a perfect lightweight bike trailer that you can sleep in anyway just love your videos always watching🎉🎉🎉
Isaac definitely wins this one
Its been a year and I still don't know if Justin actually got struck by lightning
I like samuel but i would have suggested to the guys to use 1x2s or even 2x2 non pressure treated for the frames would have saved so much weight. Could even go as far as paneling for the walls and spray foam for some insulation. Make the whole structure under 100lbs.
yo
That's not Captain America!
❤ Now to make this for the poor and homeless.  Venice portables, and Boxables tiny houses  And Capsul sleeping pods units are   Homeless,    Solutions !!!   🏡🏠🏘️⛺🏕️⛪💒 Build small trailers yourself to put tiny houses on.          It's doable!!!   Low cost, Mass production assembly line like the   Model T Ford.  Sold in high numbers make a little money on a large number sold.   Use city "sweeps", tax money to purchase them as a personally owned property to keep stuff in and safe place to sleep etc.   Off grid solar panels on the roof.          Plus:  Mini R V bike and boat camper home too is doable!!
What trailers did you start with?  Link or brand? Please
Keep in mind the cubing army watches you including me
Bunch of kids
Mansion challenge🎉
You did a great job Isaac
Somebody in this group should just be called A-frame
isaac “i have rigged this thing” andrew “to blow?” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
issac we love you buddy ❤🎉
hi
ISAAC WINS THIS ONE....
isac pants down is cracking
They made the Mansion challenge video!
Worked for a 5th wheel company..the wood was 2×2 etc. Super lite..
7:32 that jumpscared me
this build is all wrong and the Installation from the Trailers to
The doughnut house in the back ❤
You all need to do a mega luxury Cruze on mini sailboats you have to construct yourself in 6 months … Their are a lot of how to videos on wooden sailboats online , So Make it happen captain.. lol😂🎉
Hey jstu you and my dad are the only things that make me happy. My mom screams at me every time and my brother hit me all the time. I’m the youngest one and everybody hates me. You hate my dad or the only thing that make me happy.
Isaac IS THE BEST!!
7:32 bro that scared me 😂😂
Wait is jstu short for Justin Stuart
😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋 mansion challenge
Erm wat da sigma
I have an extra blanket… 😂😂
It would be cool if there were Jstu Fingerboards
Anyone else have a bit of a crush on Isaac?? He is so cute and funny ❤
you guys should do this again
Why did I jump when the edit happened of Issac’s cracking lol 😂😂😂😂
You know if you added more wheels/ ones in the right places, this wouldn't of happen, even with the less Aerodynamic A-framed one.
Cool
r.i.p. blanket
isaac did bad
7:33 ...I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I FLINCHED SO HARD..
🤣\
I would love it if someone would make a bike trailer and not only go cross-country but visit all 50 states and live full-time in it? If someone could build one of these so they could live full-time and it could be designed to carry anything that you will need because you won't be allowed to go home for a full year. You only can stay in a hotel if there is a life-threatening emergency other than that you must live in it. If you can have as much of the conveniences of home on the go with the bike trailer made to look as professional as possible? You are allowed to stay in campgrounds or boondocks. It would be cool if there was a video that could show the entire build in detail and it would be a full series and then a full series where you live in it full-time?
Love Isaac s he did a great job❤
This edit scared me SO bad!😂 7:31
Jstu
7:31 😭😭
Samuels doing a great job teaching these boys things
I just found all your videos and they are fabulous! Great forts and super ideas for the kids. Isaac you are the coolest!
That’s funny you chose that book because he liked the cover of the book. Sometimes I do that too.
I forgot his name but when he lade down on the wood to test it I thought it actually broke
Me
It would be cool if you guys did a video where only construction team gets to build and compete! That would be awesome!! And then u guys do the plinko board to see who is building for u and whoever gets the most votes in the comments wins!
Enginowitive 🤓👆
They were telling the truth it’s real life not minecraft
Just use glavinised sqaure steel and some eco friendly wood veneer
what are the drinks that justin is always drinking im curious
I think his is probably the best I think the one with the white and black is like the best one I've ever seen their the other two they're okay but like there's not like his his is really really cool I like how he did like the metal bars on to it so it's really really dirty and stuff but I do think that the wooden ones are cool too because there won't like really fall his his the wind is probably going to blow and he's going to feel uncomfortable probably I'm not himself
If it wasn't for the time constraint I definitely would do some poor man's fiberglass make a frame out of 2 x 4 Staples some bed sheets or those throw clothes like a drop cloth do a layer of it with wood glue Staples onto the frame in a specific area definitely put some plastic wrap underneath as well like the kind you cover windows with and then after that first layer starts to get tacky hit it with another layer of the wood glue and put on another one of the sheets or drop cloths take some thin aluminum sheet metal strips screwing them into the wood frame for some structural support either in an x shape or just going up and down with the main walls and then put another layer of the wood glue and drop cloth and if need be use a heat gun to expedite the drying process or even depending on the weather let it sit out in the sun and once I have like five layers of the cloth I then hit it with some primer spray paint or a rhino bed liner to make it waterproof and then I do the same thing with a door frame with some hinges PVC tubing about an inch in diameter cut that right down the middle and then drill some holes into it screw it right into the frame and run some LED light strips and run those off of a Milwaukee tool battery and get one or two battery chargers and some little computer fans run the computer fans in reverse power wise to the battery charger so while I ride the wind hits the little computer fans spitting up the motor working like an alternator pushing power into the battery charger so I can have two dead batteries charging even if it's not a lot of charge it's some and then I can use those batteries to power something other than the lights as well
Morgan29 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👍😃🤜🤛❤️❤️💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Try building a micro House inside your house
You fellas only need 3 things….1.beer 2.duct tape 3. Chicken wire. Duh !! 🤣😂🤣
Everyone knowing Justin will bye gliwsticks👇
😂
17:11
3:04 “OH YEA ,FIGHT ME “😂😂😂
I saw a donut house tooooooo.
Who misses Caleb
issac that house looks blusffery
Who has a better accent, Isaac or Tom Holland?
I have an extra blanket 😂
I love Justin's anti-neighbor awning! 🤣🤣
isaac got a fresh cut nice
the golf seine was from happy gilmore
bruh justin always with the glow sticks
You MIT grads should have just stapled sleeping bags to those frames...and bought beer and beef jerky with the left over money.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Samuel is pretty cool
YouGoGuy!
Do a nice mansion challenge please!!!!!!!!!!!!
Go Isaac
umm you guys are riding girls bikes just to let you know
I like Justin
Very awesome video
JSTU IS LIFE
I love Samuel he’s the best ❤❤❤❤❤
penne hah
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cool Vid
redo with more people
😂
Methinks they should’ve used walls made of both wood AND a foam to reduce the weight. And extended the length of the trailers while still adding support and balance. They should talk to President Chay, David Rule, and the Dungie Brothers about what I’m talking about.
Isaac Rick said he was proud of you
A bike camper seems fun, but I'd never trust people to not smash it up or steal from it the moment I stopped for a toilet break.
I like Samuel too
Why not just open a tent on top of a trailer when you get to camp
You are the best
😅❤❤❤
I"m just watch stupid man😂😂😂😂😂
Dangie bros did this give them credit
Bring back fort Fridays
Yoo fruit please 😢🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉✅
Isaac needs it just because he never wins
Super topi Wagen
Lol just Subbed 👍👍👍👍👍😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
First MISTAKE,  using RYOBI Tools 🙄🙄🙄🤯🤯🤯
No way you actually copied dangie bros.
somebody knows the song 5:00 ?
Did anyone relise justin looks
Ok
Just telling you, use foam. It light, and its waterproof
21:40 the look of disappointment because Andrew said he had another blanket when the challenge was over
They copied off of danige bros
Bro you copied video
Big dude should have gotten a tarp or something to drape over top in case of cold and weather
I love the micro houses but the mansion idea could be better
What about staying underground bunker for 200 hours 😊
I liked my own comment
Why is Samuel kinda… 🤭
The extra blanket was a violation 😂
Fight me from Andrew has never scared anyone 🤣
Why do i feel like they r bullying the fat one?
Beast
I actually thought he fell through 😅
He hit the griddy
Thanks for three things not to do!
Stop copying dangie bros!!😡😡😡
You guys should do this same thing but with homemade house boats That would be an entertaining video
It's a good thing i wasn't there i would have use campaign bored and 2x2s  and use plywood for the floor oh y'all should do another one this was fun great video guys
Dude, love the video. You all did the great job .
Video not recommended  Reason: blurs - Mumble
7:30 i really thought he fall😅
Dangiebro@
When Justin's build is bad you can tell he is pushing the barrier to try to make it sound cooler and Andrew and Isaac just say ok
you deserve it but you must have snaks
manison challenge
The mansion challenge actually sounds pretty cool, it gets my vote! Extra vote if it's a haunted mansion.
I have a video idea. They shouuld make budget challenge camper vans. They would have to stay in them for 24 hours and drive around in them.
Keeping working on your building skills guys
I jumped when at 7:33 when I thought he broke it!! 😂
this video is mess
JUST PUT WHEELS ON THE BACK IDOTS AND IM 8
CAN YOU DO THIS BUT WITH A BUGIT🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺☺☺☺
OUCH MY NOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YES I'M READY!
ULTIMATE BIKE SURVIVAL CHALLENGE!
BIKE TRAILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow 😊
Dude issac is a g
Bro sniped two people are😂 15:32
7:33 stop💀
This bike is almost perfect. It was very easy to assemble. https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx2YFGCCEkXKgqCOH-7vlvgb4L4hg4IrXI  The fit was great as well. I am 5'11" and 160 lbs with a longer torso and rather shorter legs, and 55cm is a perfect fit. Every component seems to be pretty decent and durable except the rear wheel. It was a bit lob-sided and also the freewheel component is either missing a ball bearing or under lubricated, which prevents the wheel from rotating freely. Because of that, it requires more pedaling and also climbing hills a lot harder than expected. Other than the back wheel, I like everything else about it. Affordable and well-built.** UPDATE **It turns out the sound was caused by the tight chain tension. Once I loosen it up by moving the backwheel a tad bit closer to the crankset, the sound went away.
Fun fact we can see the huge donut in the background when they show the e bikes
First since the weight limit is 200lbs i would use an aluminum frame Mdf wood for the walls and aluminum roof and if the weight at the back is to much I’d add small roller wheels for support
God loves y’all
I find it hard to believe they did any research on bike campers and didn't come across any Paul Elkins videos where he has this all down to a science...
It would be cool if there were JStu finger boards hint hint
4.17 days .= 100 hours
Isaac😂😂😂 he barely even knows how to build anything, but this time he did good even though in more of his videos, he almost killed everybody by farting
17:19 Not me thinking they were bout to plug new Jstu finger boards 😢
I love Samuel
Issac predicted the future they have jstu fingerboard now
Who else misses hyper and Caleb
You guys need to make a dough bear pillow😊😂
Hi
Whenever I see a nail gun, it makes me cringe. My cousin was making a fence in his backyard, using a nail gun, and it double pumped and sent a nail right through his thumb, right through the finger nail vertically!!!! 😬😬😬 Ouch!!
Hi I. L O V  E
i love 100hr videos and your building ones too
Did anyone notice the donut house.
Bro Justin was high asf at the start ngl
ISAAC JUST WANTS CLOUT
Mi
He literary hit the griddy🤣
Go Isaac
bring Caleb back
It's a Samuel 🙏🙏 next video please
I still can't believe how these people are so bad at building stuff!
The thumbnail looked oddly familiar
Me
You guys should do more fort Fridays
Add comment_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Isaac you are awesome amazing and I love wen you are in the videos
bro this aint the jstu I remember, i remember them doing overnight challenges in walmarts, and the camper ambulance
system overload please
Isaac is going to be so cold
I gotta wonder if they know what center of mass is...
Isaac why would you need to be heavy you are very heavy but if it’s even more heavy it’s going to fly off the hill if you have one😅
Fact:  90% of lightning strike victims survive
I saw Justin and Andrews mom😂😂😂
I want to do this for me and my dog
My mom could do better than issac and Justin I'm just saying all issac got is less weight Andrew in my opinion has the best for everything   ANDREWS 8.6 OUT OF 10 ISSACS 6.3 OUT OF TEN JUSTINS 2.1 OUT OF TEN
Bikes
I think Justin's LOOKS the best🧐
Good job
7:31 scared me so much lool
I love isaac he is some what new to this channel but he is the goat boiiiiiiiiiiiii
Sweet
If you what more speed up the hill you need to stend up and peddle and have the auto go thing on and you will have a better chance
The A frame is definitely my favorite, less claustrophobic and functional
Meet you 😂and you can make the time ⏲
dumm i zik looser he cheeted with help with pro
They should take these in woods, overnight challenge in woods are always the ngl
Imagine how many sleeping bags they have
I had a lot of fun just watching you guys!
I'm bicycling 1550 miles with 3 dogs in a bicycle trailer... In a week. Should have ordered a wikes trailer guys!
Isaac Wins
Who still miss hyper on jstu vids 😢
Who else saw the Stanley’s in the background when they went shopping😂
My fav is Andrew
I like Andrew
U guys should make a home/house
No one
What a joke😅
We all can agree that andrews tear drop won
I want you to make the movie The Wizard of Oz and also she put it in a DVD case with their your own cover and you can be the characters I hope you have a good day jay stew😊😊😊

The The Daily Caller has a list that shows how much money is in circulation in a 0:13 0:13 0:14 0:14 0:14 0:14 0:14 0:14 0:14 0:14 nine and the rest in an hour and the other two have a list that includes all of their other items that are on sale for
Nose sauce😂😂
Where's hyper?
Me
was that a happy gilmore refference???
Isaac's voice change tho
Durability-Andrew Isolation-Andrew Looks-Justin Comfyness-Justin Efficency-isaac(use of materials/weight/size) Endurance-isaac(longterm) On road-isaac/andrew Off road-Justin/isaac/andrew Overall build terms-Andrew😮 (Very close but on a medium period of time andrews is better than isaacs..justins is also very cool but it cant go a lot)
Who else just misses hiper?
The moving triangle has to be the coolest thing ive ever seen! 💀
I love how this is a real build that even we can copy (and obviously structurally perfect), it looks really fun and the way you made it bike related helps with us poor people❤️
100k likes get it to
Me
hi
For the MANY bike trailer susses builds over 15 years of youtube.... this level of abject failure is mind boggling.
Bring hyper back I hate Issac
Bring back hyper
I miss fort Friday
" i have an extra blanket " you know he was contemplating murder when he heard that after freezing all night.
What you want to do, instead of going to [insert name of store here] you want to go to a store that specifically sells wood. You'll get better quality wood and potentially for less. However, i do understand the buyers conundrum; Cost going to [place] versus price of product.
7:31
15:36 what is that movie call? xd
May be next video you do make the back wheels have 4 to have 4 wheels and if it is damaged but replacement on.
Nuts like DEEZ NUTS
They copied dangie bros idea
I miss those fans comment in public videos those were nuts !! best days of my childhood !
donut in the backgraound
Dangy bros copied you
You copied the Danji Bros
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 I'm also Green
Man I'd love to just be able to do something like this
Right who copied who then because dangie bros done this as well and your content is very similar???
Too funny videos
dang that guy gained some weight hope hes doing okay
No rules actually said that they couldn’t get a spare two wheels and make a support wheel frame using the other wheels for the backend. I actually thought of this halfway through the video after they finished the trailers.
I want Samuel to do this challenge
😍
9:16 lol!!!!
Bro copied the thumbnail on dangibro
You should do a video with Danji Bros again
You copied Dangie bros
"guys i litterly cant make this up i got strick by lightning"
Bro i neeed a nice MANSION challenge 😂😂😂 Please👍👍
Pov: the best youtubers
ฮ่าๆๆๆ ชอบๆ😂😂😂❤❤❤
The big one is dum and not the best if he sit’s on something he’ll brake it
More overnights, please
Wait, so the channel name is literally "J"ustin "Stu"art. How did I not know this after 5 years!?
you shoul do a survival challenge where you get the same amount of money but decide the shop via plinkoboard
7:32 tricked me bro
pepseye
I love your videos guys ❤
Na I do not like him but I like Justin
Awesome video! You should do this again but just make it a budget challenge!
You literally just copied president chay idea by idea
Issac”s a MONKEY 17:10
Do cheap vs expensive car builds
Meeeeeeeeeee
You copy dangey bros
Should’ve used foam…
Whenever it fake broke it it scared me💀 7:39
💯💪
Hopefully yall give it away to the homeless after the video
I mis hyper
“I had an extra blanket”……😑
Samuel is pretty cool
Why did I actually think it broke when he sat on it 😂
You guys should collaborate with Dangie Bros
i see the donut house recorded this after they built it
i don’t think people realize this but Andrew looks like the 3rd sprouse  brothers😂😂
Were did the Yoohoo guy go?
Pls post u haven’t posted in so long
My name is alfredo 😅
Love y’all
how did justins hair change colour out of nowhere
lets try to get samuel in one of these trailer survival challenges
This already been done by so many other YouTubers
Do a Temu survival budget challenge
21:41 Can anyone else hear Issac screaming on the inside?
Good job Is Zack
They are coping dangerous Brosnan
Steal from dangie bros
I think I would use pvc pipe it's strong, and light weight
Me
You need a new camera
Not me
If you are reading this, know that God loves you and has a plan for your life❤🙏
Collab with hyper
Yes for the Nintendo switch in the tiny home lol
This is absolutely the most entertaining channel on YouTube 😂
❗️⚠️tHęré åRē BūGŠ Ûńdęr ÿØùR Śkįñ⚠️❗️
w vid keep up the good work :)
7:56 I hate that I recognize the scream from Indiana Jones
You don't need to understand German to gain knowledge from German language bike trailer build videos.
Rise your hand 🤚 if you like jStu 🎉
Bring back fort Friday 😢
You guys just copies dangie bros.
Idea buy ranch style fourwheelers and make campers for behind them
I just love the part there's only a few left and there mInE🥺-😂
i love how justin show spongebob saying its fine lol
7:31 that was a best jumpscare😂😂
Dangie Bros done way way better.  theirs was fabulous
12:04 I think I MIGHT support you.
W Isaac
Meassure twice cut once
The problem with your frames is that they’re not aerodynamic, the slope should be in the front of the trailer facing the direction of the wind, the slope of Justin’s is too steep to do anything. The more area the larger the air resistance.
the extra Blankett got me so good lol
We want hyper back!
I bet secretly Justin and Andrew don't like finger boarding but they don't want to make Isaac sad
A budget overnight survival challenge built by fans
I heard a Australian accent I thought it was Andrew
Your mom👩🏼
Copying dangle bros
Shower ceten home
When it said (boys your gonna pay for this😂)
This video halirous
Justin needs to lessen to Andrea
WHEN YALL EDITED SAMUEL FALLING I THOUGHT IT ACTUALLY BROKE😭
I hate to live where they live lol specially going to stores. You tryna find items &. you see it’s all gone but then you look at their videos &. they took it all. 😂😂
This video made me laugh so much 😁🤣
Why is no one talking about how justin got struck by lightning😢
When Isaac first sat on his build i actually thought he fell and broke his build Greta editing 😂
When it pretends the platform broke I got so scared
6:58 Justin. tip: cut the edges of both pieces of wood at an angle so that they meet up flush (if not already done)
I thought issac actually fell through his build at 7:38
One of my favorite yutubers
Stop copying dangie bros
You should do a budget challenge it’s like when you get a budget you have to build a mini trailer and survive overnight and you have to ride to you destination and ride back to the house.
The Jstu should make a video of making your own boat and fishing rod and whoever catches the least fish has a mega punishment.
Does anyone else remember “hide and seek league?” They did season one in 2019 then after that, they never did it again. 😢
Awesome video
7:33 got me jumping from my sofa
hey guys I have been watching you guys since I was like 6 years old its been a while since you guys started making videos and I think you guys should make a video were you just watch your oldest videos best moments and what your think about then and now and what you guys are thinking of doing in the future and what you guys were thinking back then. I think it will be cool
You should do fishing budget challenge
You know how funny this was
I dare u to do a "live in a lego house for 24h"
I don’t really like to do a bear, but I will still buy the shirt
Love your videos keep up the good work

Ride bikes all the way to the gas station

You guys should do a survival challenge with workout items only for 24 hours

I wonder if after getting struck by lightning did Justin get superpowers
First comment in an hour
7:35 I genuinely thought it broke lol
I built a trailer like this once... It has a full solar system however... and only weighs 150 pounds. I have Ideas of better ones but yk life...
Justin, you can put wheels on the back legs of your camper
Nobody going to say about Justin's hair so white and gray
We all love the jstu Crew!
When is the Mansion house video?
At 7:32 I really thought it broke, scared the heck out of me! Love your vids!

You guys should do overnight hammock camping with a fire pit but make your hammocks water proof so install a roof over the hammock
We need hyper back
You guys should bring Kevin for a video
I ain’t supporting Isaac his is just made out of shower curtains it’s gonna be so cold
These guys must be BILLIONAIRES, most of their videos are now 1 million PLUS and I watched them when they started. The forts, snack song, CONGRATULATIONS!

2:18 did he really just say "this thing actually has 'real-life shocks' lmao "
OK OK yall are obviously making these for a much younger audience but me as 17 finds it pretty entertaining to be able to still be a kid
You guys are the best Jstu😂❤❤❤😊
Who doesn't want to do a survival in a mansion.😂
Did Justin legit get struck by lightning??
Y’all are awesome
All of that food looks so good
That looks pretty cool
Hyper would have worn merch, unlike issac.
Should do a cross state/ country version of this with electric trikes with solar panels or a generator charging the batteries constantly would be pretty epic
Did Justin actually get shocked by lighting?
Y’all need that soft dude back. He made the videos so much better
Cool
Can you do more big foot videos
Issacs tattoos are sick! Thanks for the amazing entertainment you guys never fail to make us laugh
They have a good editor
hey @jstu imconfused is it legit ngl its abit scetch but i love the channel
You guys should do a thrift store items only challenge
#musthavesnack
You guys just crack me up
Andrew's was easily the best. Isaac's was incredibly subpar, as usual, and Justin went form over function, also as usual.
I love  when you guys do this
Bike campers Do work and ARE a real thing,  They can range from   the  Wide Path Bicycle Camper,  That can sit 2 inside in "dinette mode"   or sleep 1-2 comfortably.     There's a mody bike camper, its much smaller only sleeps 1  There have been several custom builds that are just beutiful,  and useable down to -40c...   complete with heater,  insulation, power, cooking, and such.
do another short film challenge pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase (hyper's was best)
Yea stay in a mansion
Jstu, I saw Andrew's house in Lorson Ranch or Justin's
You in  Utah.....???❤🎉
5:28
I don't think Justin really got struck by lightning. 🙄
Is it just me or is JStu 1000 times better than all the other Chanel’s out their
I love the fact that Justin thought his shelter was the best until it fell apart.
You’re not 6 foot two, oh yeah fight me😂
When is kalen
you should do budget challenges but all budgets MUST be over 200$ on the plinko board 😊 & then at the end, have 3 judges pick their favorite. losers get a punishment 😂
did any one notice Justin's hair changed to white
I almost had a heart attack 😨 7:33
When y’all do fort Friday can y’all go to Walmart
👍 That's my like because I can't hit the because it won't let me.
❤😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊
Ah daddy
Me
this was the first of u guys's video, I alredy love the chanel
Hi guys im new :)
I have a suggestion for the next video can u guys make robots? Just a question If you don't want to make that video remember I'm just suggesting
Who else miss Hyper and his train gang
I’ve just realised Jstu means J For Justin and stu I guess for Andrew And I’ve been watching for like 5-6 years😂😮
5,6 Nike kicks
3,4 buckle some more
1,2 buckle my shoe
It good for a kid but not bad not bad if I were 7 years old I would love it love the channel ❤️ and keep the vid coming and I hope yoou make it to 8 million subscribers ❤️ I’m watching all day 💻
70 ‘s man
Remember sean
Yo Justin remember that time you went on relative race?
HOMEMADE BIKE CAMPERS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE HOMELESS
So zapped by lightning 🌩
Should do a week long survival challenge
Where hyper pls bring him back
good job
Did Justin Really get struck by lightning
Make your own campers but you all have to be able to stay in them
Bro why did you get rid of marv  Bruh I remember when you anouced him in the overnight baseball challenge same with toasty
Yall should bring back hyper for a video it's been a while
Bro 7:35 scarf me
I wasn’t able to watch it at first I was in the hospital
More fort Friday please
Sale 1 dollar pasta
I love your video
Where is hyper?
When you edited Isaac falling it scared me so much
I love that how in the first 10 seconds they say they got 3 identical e bikes but yet they are all different colors
Issac is spiderman 👍👍👍👍
MUST HAVE SNACKS
48 hours  billing big tree house
Imagine electric bikes 😮
Justin’s sneaker game is on point
video suggestion: speed building forts dollar items only
I wish I could see you in person
I love you guys
You guys are the best how do you do this stuff and this was 2days ago
"I have an extra blanket" rip issac
Nobody
Hi
Also with a wood base as always
Foam like material would be much lighter
My dad is paving your driveway
.    hehe
massive w to editor
I thought he actually fell then
8:25
Wood is one of the heaviest things to build with. My recommendation is that you’d build with some type of carbon or some cheap plastic that wont be too heavy.
Why didn’t you put 4 wheels under the trailer?
When Justin came over saying he got struck by lightning 🤣🤣🤣
I live in Denver Colorado like where they live
do the mansion idea
At 7:36 it scared me when he fell
whats v.o mean?
Justin if you put wheels on the back it would of stayed up while riding
They have a really good editor😮😮
We need stay in the nice mansion challenge
Hello jstu if you are reading this i think you should make homemade mini house boats and survive on them for 24 hours! :)
-For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.

(Hebrews 13:12) -For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:   (1 Peter 3:18)
andrew really did a great job in this episode
I wonder how many sleeping bags they have bought over the years. The need a sleeping bag sponsorship tbh.
I like Justins for spring Andrews for winter and Isaacs for summer
What’s the big donut for👀🤔
No way that Isaac Jump scare actually got me 7:34
You guys should take these e-bikes on a road trip
Griddy Justin at 1:07

You guys should have had 4 wheels instead of 2 nice video tho!😂
Andrew is the best

Why is Justin’s hair white in the thumbnail?
who like isacc
waaaait, did Justin dye his hair? looks great, suits him :)
was gonna say Izzy, buddy, you dont wanna start a fire right next to your bed xD  these are cool id like to see you three try & do a build-off together versus Sammy & 2 other crew members (Izzy chooses them) one day please? maybe you could do the "build & stay in a mansion" challenge at the same time perhaps? x
Do this challenge again but instead of bikes use motorcycle
Justin are you okay
what’s that big donut yellow thing in the back near the beginning of the vid
Am I the only one that had a heart attack 7:32
Andrew is the best builder I'm not gonna lie👍💯
7:33 jump scare 😭😭
What happend to marv
Justin casually say "i just got struck by lightning"
How about a three wheeler bike
Bro y’all should do something in the ambulance … I miss when y’all did that kinda stuff 😢
Hey I have a question for u justin
did anyone else jump at 7:33
SO CREATIVE LOVE YOU GUYS IVE BEEN WATCHING SINCE 2016
Good job Issac!!
No one's going to talk about the yellow building in the background with the pink roof
Im very curious what it would be like if hyper an leb daddy was in this video, oike if you miss hyper an caleb
Bring back fort Friday 👇

This was awesome keep making good contact
feed iscac to the bears
THE EDIT😂😂😂😂😂
Congrats Isaac for being the best ❤

I love you my name is Justin to I’m always on the team
You guys copied President Chay

Since when does Justin have grey hair?
The fact that Andrew didn’t give Issac the blanket broke my heart 😢  Love Jstu!
yo
7:34 I flinched 😂
8:14 😂 We love any reference to Middle-Earth! It was awesome how he “exploded”😂😂😂
les go
The issac fall freaked man
great job Isaac
You guys need to do tiny rv challenge and then everyone gets a Quad to make the rv with
I have an extra blanket!!!!  Bruh!!!!! 😂😂😂
❤
7:31 scared me so bad
Thank you to whoever edited this video. You did an absolutely amazing job!!!
9:13 🤣🤣🤣🤣 legitimately hilarious
If you want to give away one I really want 1. And you're my favorite YouTube.  If I had money I would donate to you.
Blow up tent would have been possible easier
Why did Justin's Hair go blonde When it turned night??
I miss the hidden gaming rooms content
I like Andrews cabin.
I just figured it out that jstu stands for Justin Stewart
Who  else  loves   ol   of   dem??? 🎉🎉
I've wanted to do this but for more longterm purposes
Anyone notice the (doughnut?) building in the background? @ 3:50
Dose jstu stand for Justin Stuart?
7:31 RIP
Do a stay in the nice mansion challenge lmao
No one
I saw wild
for the first time ever i like all three of the forts
Hi
nice a good! good! good!
WHAT HAPPENED TO TYLER?!
i feel like justin should stop wearing caps cause his hair is nice
You need to show Isaac the cave fort that you went with hyper
Myself and 2 other people live on a BMX bike, but we got the pegs for it OH MY GOSH!!! #LoveIt #estaSTUPIDA #AMigo #TapeZombie THEY WILL CALL YOUR NUMBER!!
I need a ✨pepsya✨
I don't like the new edits with the movie clips and sound effects. It ruins the video experience. There's a reason the biggest YouTubers like Mr beast doesn't do that.
Justin is crative but not so good but good
Bro got struck by lightning ⚡⚡⚡⚡
NO
It’s time for stay in the nice mansion challenge
Even though it failed, the A frame trailer looked pretty sick.
“I have an extra blanket?!… 😂😂😂
Spoiler alert 17:18?????
Please make this into a challenge on who can stay in their mobile home for the longest! That would be a great video. Much love!! Keep up the good work!
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SWEAR ON A KIDS CHANNEL, THATS HOW YOU GET LESS VEIWS 😡
you three should do a build battle against samuel
How much do you spend in a survival video?
Hi ❤cool
#JstuRocks
Bro does not know what blowing up means
Andrew made the best!!!!!!  U suc Isaac
What do you guys do with the stuff you make after the videos
❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊
love the vid so funny too
DO a Tree house mansion challenge👍👍
You idiots made me laugh 😢 it’s gonna be a coin flip to get my subscription 😂
I LOVE THIS TYPE OF VIDEOS PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE! YOU GUYS ROCK!!!
Dude everyone they make izeck fake call through something I always get like scared lol
NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE DONUT HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND
Must admit Andrew’s trailer was the  bomb
Do a budget overnight in the freezing cold 🥶 underground
I do not like him
Next time out the bikes on low gear it wouldn’t be struggling
I love this kind of videos guys keep going
Ummmm idk why but when they put the thing where when he sat on it and it broke it made me jump like really high hahaha
Isaac is my best of the three ❤
K I need the full story of how Justin got struck by lightning
You guys should do a laat to leave mantion where you make a challenge where every hour you need to finish all the food to stay in challenge every hour it gets harder
Where’s hyper
7:33 I flinch😂
We love Issac Hes so funny. Hes going places.👌👌😁😁
Nice videos
Original creator president chay
The extra blanket lol.. that was colder than the weather!
Justin your hair is 💣.Icy af!
Hey are you guys gonna ever do a mini house on the lake?
Hi

justin has a block of cheese 🤣🤣🤣🤣
7:32 AFV moment. Also, this made my night. 😂😂😂. 13:51 Another AFV moment.
You guys were my childhood😭
Did Justin really got atruck by lightning?
The bear shirt
Why haven hyper bin in  the video
I think I know who is staying longest is Justin and Andrew because they build their small houses out of wood
Jstu does mini everything and they were talking about a mansion, so they should do mini mansion challenge but it would just be a regular house😂
Top Job Chaps 🤘
WHY IS THERE NAME IM HERE
E Bikes are the enemy! The one I was riding last Saturday came out from under me and broke my collar bone into three pieces! 🙃
I'm the biggest fan 😯
I'm 100% on board with Isaac about the mansion that'd be really nice oh yeah what's the name of that movie where that little clip showed a man & his wife get hit in the head with golf balls that looked like it would be a pretty funny movie
I loved it
Jstu buys new equipment for tbeir survival mission every episode , 😂like they gotta have over 1000 sleeping bags
Love the green grass! Gives it a nicer vibe
22:18 what's that at the back
I'm the 1000th comment soo pin?
❤
https://youtu.be/ufIfEzxASlk  transformers7 fanmade version new trialer
Video idea: Samuel gets 100 dollars and u 3 get 500 and u see who can build the best
I have made it my life journey to make a custom jstu fingerboard and send it to them.
Justin are you a sneaker head?
Hi I'm Mariah and I live in Boulder Colorado I really want to get to know you guys I love all of your videos and you're such good YouTubers u am 10 years old and God bless love u guys❤

Hey wait a minute didn’t someone already make a e bike trailer?
Andrew has his tear drip backwards so it is reverse aerodynamic
Me
Bring back fort Friday please!!!!
Yessss do the mansion challenge lol 😂
Who else loves Samuel? 👇
15:34 what is that from can someone tell me please.
Justin and Andrew would have better chances issac has to build a bigger one and it will be more heavy (no offense)
They should’ve also did a budget limit on how much they were allowed to spend on their camper built 🤔
9:12 I can't 😂
wait how is his hair white?
You heard the man, 100k likes and Justin does a week in it
What’s the big donut in the background?
we need bufget challenges with hyperr
You should do this with rad power bikes
Daddy chill
Such a creative idea!! Love it
you guys are getting alot better at building, so i think you should do more videos like this
Make a sports card video
Love your videos and how old is Isaac
Wish jstu would do a contest to add someone else. Just isn’t the same without hyper and the other guy. 😢 cringe sometimes
Put a helmet on
Who else loves jstu 👇comments down below
Why don't yu go to conjuring house?
We’re did they get that massive donut house 3:57
link the tree house fall video
Isaac!!!
This perfect temporary home for homles but they can't even do thath for them are treated like wild cats rats.
Quick everyone get this video to 100k likes
😂 6:42
The new rules
When did Justin dye his hair blonde
U should do a over night in TSC
This video built like a college essay with a 10 page requirement having most of the content being citations lol
This was so cool!! I love y'all's challenges! Justin has to stay in it for a week 🤣🎉
lamo
yessirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
LLf
I love you guys, you always leave a smile on my face

What does JStu stand for ive been a subscriber for years but never knew
Come to cooper’s birthday party
Andrew how much u want for ur bike house?
Do a mansion house
Jstu
Andrew for towing you want the weight in the middle.😊
You guy video is never disappointed me ever I love it very much
you guys are getting alot better at building, so i think you should do more videos like this
Me only just realizing that jstu is short for Justin Stuart
#IstandwithIssac
I feel like this video would have been cooler if they did the blinko budget challenge but this was still a good vid
My dog is named samuel
You have the same Nintendo as me
I think the winner of bike trailers  Andrew - he make it functional and make the most secure shelter, warm and entertainment with solar panel and even a include a projector to watch movies, if he make it just a alittle bit big just to sit comfortable this is home run Isaac - come 2nd functional but need to improve shelter, in a bad timing he can be eaten by wild animals  Justin - is disqualified because he didnt make it a functional trailer but his trailer is so far the most comfortable and vibe
Did anyone else notice that issac wore same thing both days🤣🤣🤣
Sweet bike trailers. HEY! how about another zambie apocalypse survival video, but with a homemade MAD MAX War Rig? Please leave a memo and let me know what you guys think about about surviving a zambie apocalypse in the wastelands in a homemade War Rig MAD MAX Style. And please leave a comment and like for this video. Please, Merci and........HOY EH!!!! P.S. You might need Samuel for the construction of the War Rig.
when they post its always a good day ngl i look forward to when they post
Hi my name is Owen thompson and I am 7 years old🤑🤑🤑
14:28 did he say compract? 😂 issac is still King!!
im gonna be honest guys, this is the best video so far from this channel.  I'm not gonna lie.
You guys are the type of people to invent a building item to build a building item to build an item
Nah he got stuck by lightning
Justin has the best  camper
I love these guys vids keep on going Justin and Andrew. You are the happiness to my day❤❤
You got struck by lightning… Ben there.
I just started watching your videos 4 days ago and I have already watched like 40 of your videos, I love your content so much already. Biggest fan😭🥳🥳🥳
Neat challenge. Cool bike trailers. Thanks for sharing
This is super cool
Love the swirls at race track
Spongebob Memes fit so well
I thought Justin would be first to surrender, but am happy to see he did well overall. Andrew's looks uncomfortable but he seemed pleased, so kudos to him. Isaac looks great, at least for summer weather.
*can you guys recreate this video, but this time use four wheelers or something stronger yet small*
What do you guys do with everything you buy? I would love to come to a Garage sell if y’all ever have one.
I just now realized Justin looks like Messi😂
good job i think that is the one of my favs keep making more videos
# Isaac sucks
Lets try it guys.. nice mansion challenge ahahahahha lets see the difference in your ingenuiety with a budget😂😊😂😊😂😅😅
I've been making a bike camper too😮
E
Can I buy Andrew’s trailer for 200$
Justin is crazy
This just might be me, but Reese looks like Tony Stark With the glasses he was wearing
😎👍
BRO YOU SCARED ME 7:32
What is your twitch
you should give out your houses and tiny homes to people who need it or to your fans or sell them!
put a phone fall count
Please do a part 2
What happened to piper?
Yh
hello
Say swear my man really got struck by lightning?! 🤯🤯 Hope he's ok. 💖👍🏾 Great vid and great builds guys. 😁👍🏾
That edit of the happy Gilmore was on point 😂😂
Love the overnights
Why the extra edits they always make the vid 10 times better
I've what he'd jstu for so long
I LOVED THIS!
Hello there mate
Did that edit on issac snapping the wood make anyone else almost jump out of there seat?😳
Awesome Video Guys
Isaac has always been my favorite sorry guys
That SpongeBob clip had me dying😂
Isaac is now bald
Hi
Go isaac go, great job guys❤❤❤😎😎👍👍
I miss Caleb and hyper :(
I ❤ your videos
New Jstu Or Old Jstu
Isaac successfully built a frame that fulfilled the biking needs. Just needed a bit of insulation. I think Andrew won overall even though his was the 2nd to deteriorate.
The editing in this video was top tier 😂
President chay
Lord Andrew, when you do another budget video can you do the "I like turtles" Drop
Survival challenge hahahaha real funny guys
Justin with the gold chain sheesh
Not trying to be a Kevin, but when towing you actually want most of the weight over the axles.  Too much to the front and you pop wheelies, too much to the back and you fishtail.
At the very end . Andrew : " I have an extra blanket. " 😂🤣😂
you guys have inspiered me to bilud forts for 13 years i am 21 still waching
Yes we love these types of vidoe, thank you all so much for doing this 🤣
Well done guys, you all did a pretty fab job, I’m so proud of you all,  I was impressed with Issac, he tried hard this time and succeeded. Thank you for a really awesome video. Love you guys. ❤️❤️❤️🫠🫠🫠🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼👍👍👍⛺️⛺️⛺️
Hi Lord Andrew
Was waiting for Isaac to say Glizzies for his dinner.
Bring hyper once again guys
I liked when Isaac and Andrew got smaked it was so funny that it made me laugh so hard i fell off my bed
Btw did I just see a donut house off in the distance at 3:15
Love your videos plz do more overnights
I've been hear since the more jstu as kids vid 7 yrs ago
Samuel you are the best behind  Jstu...You deserve so much credit. You make Jstu solid ... standing up or lying down 😂 #JstuRocks
What is the donut in the background?
If only it was a budget challenge
God whats next? : Trying to build a 2 story house on a trailer?!
Me😊
That transition in the begging tho that was smooth🥶
I thought he actually broke the wood when testing it good edit lol
👋 if your tired of Issac!
3:05
weich one would you live in
Isac might be the worst 3rd guy on this channel, only funny part about him is him being fat (what shouldnt even be funny, rather concerning)
You guys should do a video where it’s the three of you guys vs Samuel in like a build competition
Justin growing gray hair?
You should have samual the builder compete in a buget overnite challenge!
jump scare
I have an extra blanket “😑”
Can you start fort Friday again plz
Nice vid

I think Andrews was the best but Justin is my favorite interior

That edit was fucking clean
7:34 actually scared me lol 😆
Isaac saying he wanna be ingenuity to the best but then buys metal……. First thing comes to my mind is I want to make the thing light as possible but also as warm/cold as possible

Would like to see more of these
Next video you make can it be staying the night at Walmart?
ha
I sold my house for a bike camper..
But Andrew and Justin’s are still cool
Thay should do a budget challenge like this
Jstu deserves way more views than they get
We have got to get the mansion challenge
Isaac is the best trailer
I kind believe he's from Britain with the PepsI at 17:33
Ok izzic did good up to this point in the video idk about the rest sorry if I spelt your name wrong (it probly is)
Who else thinks Rick is actually proud of Isaac
Its my birthday today! Can i get a comment from JSTU?
i love justin's one i would live in it
making a "mansion" sounds cool. just building something big to stay in, then having a budget could be a neat idea. or somehow staying in a house, but you can only use items you buy on a budget
as soon i see new video from jstu i just jump on it.
W uploaded every week
I love the vid please do more over night challenge ❤
7:33 i had a jumpscare😂
Hi
Love your videos
hi
I think this is really cool how you guys are building  little campers it’s really creative and I really like it ❤❤
18:38 “Dude I can’t make this up I literally just got struck by lightning” 😭😂😂😂
Isacs house is a lihgtnig rod on 2 wheeels he is gonna kill himself🤦‍♂️
Isac falling was the best jumpscare ever 😂😂.

Good job isaac

Who else was laughing at 4:13?
I love your videos and u are incredible YouTuber and u never fail to entertain us
Who else saw a donut house in the background when they were building ? SPOILERSSS????????
I love marve😢
good job isaac
Not going to lie they  helped me for years ty❤
7:33 that scared fr bro😂
If something has a rating of 200lbs it can probably only do 150-175lbs
Hi
Bring Fort Friday back 😢
We need a redo with better frames for the bikes so you can actually go alot further
We support you Isaac 👏
You're basically trying out homelessness lol
Good idea
“Duvet, isn’t that a toilet?” 😂😂😂
We bought three identical e bikes and they’re different colors
Incredibly done by the master builders Jstu
I hope they make this kind of videos all the time its awesome 😊
Who else has been here for more than 8 years?
I wanna see more videos like this. Keep it up Jstu!
The trailer videos are my favourite 👌
Isaac needs to fast. I'm on day 6 of 31 day water fast. If I can do it to lose weight, he can!
This was a pretty funny and awesome video
Yeah, and the sea people can make mistakes and learn from them just like what happened whenever I thought whenever I was with Xander though OK cause I remember that one time and I was six so my memory is a little fuzzy but I remember when we didn’t have a stupid sign in the park The third park I only have three parks near me well 3 1/2 anyway and this was win. Xander knew all the shortcuts downtown to. He showed me all of his cool secrets to OK so anyway this is like when we didn’t have a stupid sign in the park which you know everybody enjoys and mostly just because it reminds me of my mom a little bit as well. OK so anyway like I was saying this was I was six and anyway he had some dog flowers and I was well I didn’t tell my grandma this side of the story or of one of them but I remember that he wanted to show me them and I said OK cool and this was also when I can break my leg to but this was like weeks before I broke my leg and anyway so he showed me his dog flowers which they’re very rare. Now you can’t get them but it was so scary I thought I was gonna die even just smelling them with so much pollen and I was six back then because I was pretty much allergic to pollen back then plus, I learn from my mistake not to inhale so much pollen because otherwise that I start ending up a sneezy mess and my face gets very, very itchy and other things happened to me too like not just awkward dreams
you should bring back marve.🍩
Isaac doesn't deserve how much Justin and Andrew make fun of him 😭  Good job Isaac, well done 👍
Yikes...   This one was almost painful to watch.  So little... LITTLE common sense.  even the most basic concepts of weight limits, weight distribution was lost here.  There are TONS of actual bike campers and the first rule is always weight.  they use very light weight materials,   They could have done so much with this challenge using much thinner wood, aluminum piping,  tarps,  foam board. anything to keep the weight down...     Heck, this would have been so much fun to do if they didn't care about a budget because they could have had solar  light weight foamboard and covering roof, with solar panels...  tarp siding insulation...     Since they are using Ryobi power tools, get the Ryobi power inverters now they can use the batteries from the power tool to power the lights, and other functions...
Nce
We need Andrew and miniminter in a video!
This is so awesome😄😄😄
WhAat
THIS IS SOOOOOO COOOOL ❤🎉😊

483 comment and 53k view
I absolutely love watching your vids buds I'd love to be a guest star in your video
Isaac stop using polls for your buildings
Polls are dangerous
Issac’s could go the farthest but I think Andrew’s was the best
Because you use Ryobi products so often, then they should sponsor you :) Oh how i would like to take part in those challenges too, it would be fun and epic. Well done video. I would love to see longer camping time like 2-3 days maybe. A bit longer and harder challenges.
You guys should do a video where you make vehicles and spend the night in them
I want to see hyper 🥲🥲
Hear me out. No budget but use everything you can carry challenge??
❤love frrom my sass
Kinda early
I love you guys ❤💙
You guys are copping presedent chay
Hi
Nice Video Lol 7:32 scared out of me tho
This channel really makes me laugh daily 😂
I'm a huge fan I've watched you from the very beginning
bro did the dirtiest transition 0:44 and thought we wouldnt notice
Yes sir. nice video
haloo
best video
omg, jstu is the best youtube channel EVER
The ol' "lightning dyed my hair" gag. Classic. 😉
Justin, I’ve got the same shoes as you, and I’ve got the air mags I got the Michigan’s I got the reverse Brazil’s, and I got the monopolies in my dad’s a big sneaker head. He legit almost has every single Jordan.
I love JSTU
We miss hyper to all the ogs
(5:23 ha)
I like this as i am a traveling artist that me and my service animal travel and live with a bicycle and bike trailer, if i could afford a ebike or better trailer i would love it
I wish their video’s didn’t take so long to make so I could see more, but I know these videos take a long time
The material camp house was terrible if it rained you would have been soaked
Need that mansion survival challenge
best jstu video ever
Jstu's transitions are amazing
Do this again
Andrew pulling the extra blanket he had poor is issac😂

Lol issac hasn’t been apart of the team very long but I can’t count how many times I’ve see him in his underpants
Im just surprised that after this long of making videos about building things you guys are still terrible at building things. 😂
You guys should do NBA game budget challenge you can do gear seats and food
Isaac’s trailer is a lesson in straying from the script
Can you still buy Marv?
I JUST THEY REFRANCED MY FINGER BOARDIDEA
Nice vid keep up the good work 😊
If I were to compare the top three funniest people in Jstu history the funniest would be Issac but hyper still holds a place in my heart
