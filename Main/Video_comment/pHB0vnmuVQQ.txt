Tbh he deserved it 😆
17:29 17:30 17:30 17:30 17:36 17:37 17:37 😊
45
10:37 why does it say shag here
21:35 Subtle foreshadowing.
21:30 FORESHADOWING
I love this series so much, I've gotten through half of this season in 24 hours 😭
21:41  dam that’s a lot of copper
18:08 unless he had loyalty (which i didnt spot)… didnt he throw it into the void on accident when he threw it at grian 😭
Battlefront 3
How was diagon alley it not called Ali G
21:31 True that did happen
Which episode was this from, ik it was season 8 but which episode
i hadn't drank all day so laughing for so much actuaslly made my mouth and throat so damn dry that it huiirt  HURT
at this point grian had to of thought this was a bad idea
20:36
I’ve watched all of Grian’s Hermit videos up to this point and he’s really entertaining, BUT! The way he makes playing the game sound like such a chore is driving me insane. Everything he does Grian makes it sound like it’s the worst thing to do. There is no way I’d be buying deep slate, let alone for two stacks of diamond 😂 Everyone that plays Minecraft knows it’s not as bad as he makes it sound 😅
The way the Grian said only 6 shulker boxes
The small “dang it” I love it 14:30
meanwhile one of the only things im good at is at farming deepslate (I spend almost all my time on the mines)
Pls pin?
8:55 @rainbolt c'mon, do something
Years later, rewatching and Grian going, "The sever will end in an apocalypse," 21:29  was both the best and accidental foreshadowing.
Grain predicted the moon apocalypse!!!!  21:32 HE KNEW
“If i don’t get something done by the time that this oxidizes the server will result in an apocalypse”  -grian, predicting the future
“Look how slow this mining is” *proceeds to mine at basic creative mode speed* 😂🥲
7:54 13:00
Grian: Wonk.
I absolutely love doing the boring things. I'd sit in that mine for hours picking cobbled deepslate. Or sorting chests and barrels. Like i love it- 😂
13:18 14:32 16:03 22:38
3:57 FOOL OF A TOOK
You know the mech/pirate ship in Goatem that Doc and, I assume, Jevin made? Im actually trying to recreate it in my own world, but hitting a bunch of problems.. HELP!
19:09 song name
21:30 I just now realized... foreshadowing
I need griangotts
Why not use netherite pickaxe for the deepslate?
The day the lore started  21:27
Bruv made a whole cave
You should have placed a bucket of water in the scar hole
Seeing grian black mail scar to build where he wants is so funny
''Today we're going to be sending a message, to Scar.''  _Season 7 Turf War flashbacks intensify_
I think we could all use a little bit of wonk.
You shall reply in 9:35
Ok... Scar must have a curse or something. But might I add the amount of times he has almost died, just convinced me that he is imortal.
I got name for alley. GALLEY!
Idea: name the bank grain-gots bank
W O N K
what episode is scars pov?
Just an idea but what if let’s say. . . “Cubfan was slayed by the good deals at boatam INC” again, just an idea
Grian won't name it till the fin-alley
when grian died to the void after knocking scar into the void was just perfectly instant karma
i love that the standard in Hermitcraft for a 'decent' amount of deepslate or cobblestone is more than 6 shulker boxes
Is it just me who could hear Mumbos chat massage “REALLY?!” 😂😂😂
If we had a nickle for every time grian has put mumbo in charge without telling him, we'd have two nickles Wich is probably way too many
I think the best name for the alley is G STREET or GRIAN STREET❤ i actually like it
Grian: "if i dont get something done by the time this oxidizes, the server will end in an apocalypse"   Me: spoilers
Scar makes back of grian's base? (flashbacks)
Horizont Alley
make kings cross
Bruh just casually saying 6 shulkerboxes of deepslate
15:01 is it just me or did the bedrock start cracking
I guess you could say the deal that Grian and Scar had made about him getting out of the hole and him building on Grian's "sky lot" is now NULL and VOID. LOL
What music did you use for Timelapse 9:15
Grian season 7: I let Scar do the back Grian season 8: I let Scar do the back Gria season 9: Scar tried to help me starting on the back so I started a war
B
21:27 The moment he doomed the entire server. Grian is officially a fortune teller.
So really you4 just making you4 own diagon ally mate
Season 8 is my favourite season
Horizantally
why dont yall build tree farms its so fast
21:27 well that didn't age well...
16:34   "Wow" famous last words
Crying because this doesn’t feel like a year ago
I built a castle out of cobbled deepslate and I was using stone and iron pickaxes... I hated it.
The more Grian and Scar meet the more for the boatem pole
22:30 I mean Hes Not wrong, Moon big
no sign? well there's one right there!
12:57, 16:02, 20:30
11:22
MJ: So I’m building a really big mountain G: Ok I’ll do that too P: I’ll build a really big luscious hilly mountain S: Ok I’ll build on top of Grians base with bigger mountains I: ILL BUILD A FACTORY
“ Now these two were a little bit too straight, so I added a little bit of *wonk* “    Has to be one of the best lines this of this episode
of course! can't be a grian video without off camera mining!
Griagon alley
To be fair, you _did_ say ( in an earlier episode) that to seal a deal, you have to jump into the void.
"Today's episode, we'll gonna be sending a message to Scar." *Turf war flashbacks*
I would want to call it "horizon tally" like diagon ally
Fun fact: this is grian’s 200’th episode
21:26 we can all thank Grian for the end of this season LOL
id say the boatem hole is probably the richest thing on the server
You both make me laugh so much, even on bad days.
Scars scream when he gets scared always kills me😂
Isn't lag just great?
Wonk is the new cowbell
He said that if he did not get something done the server will end in a apocalypse copper dam.
GRIAN finally is working on The Galleyway
Just have a back up tool
I think it should be called “graingon alley”
21:27 he says if he doesn’t d something by the time the copper oxidizes, an apocalypse will happen. And later in the series, the moon crashes. I don’t think he’ll get something done by the time the copper oxidizes
Does anyone know what  song he uses at 19:05
Lag
Ooooh! This is where the lagging into my inventory "bug" started 😂
"See these two were too straight "-my parents
Watching this a year later at 21:26, Grian literally predicts the end of the server. I’m now forever going to blame the shortest season of hermitcraft ever on Grian procrastinating.
What’s the song for the Timelapse
"If I dont get somthing donee by the time this oxides this server will end in an apocalypse "... he knew what he was doing
0:27 why does Scars starter base remind me of the Ninkienonk from The Night Garden?
18:09 grians oh no
Scar is such a naughty schoolboy
So this is the episode where that falling scene came from. Stunning. 😎✨
Grian don't know what it said is 5car build here not scar build here 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gee my brother just made a sendwich, but i found out mine is missing, how odd, lag irl?
Alternate title: 2 idiots die in a hole
9:17 these buildings are like that one goth, barbie and normie house meme
9:28 From all my times on Tiktok I had no idea that Grian said “Now these two were actually a little bit too straight. So I added a little bit of wonk”
Grian about deepslate: "This is going to be such a painful process."  Me on bedrock: That's how we are with stone
Impulse already has a giger base lol
Me who loves building deepslate mining it with a iron pickaxe: Wow, that’s fast!
seasons ovver, never got around to watching this, but it wouldve been cool to add the building you stayed in with an armor stand with your face in it
2:26 hmmm, I KNOW LOSING EVERYTHING ALL OVER AGAIN BUT THATS NOT EVEN A SACRIFICE TO THE BOATEM HOLE :)
How do they keep getting more elytra? The unlooted end cities are like THOSANDS of blocks away.
Should've been tie u tried to make me buy stuff, I KNOW IM AMOLST A WHOLE YEAR LATE NO ONE SAY ANYTHING UNLESS U WANNA BE CURSED OUT
15:04 how does bedrock have breaking particles?!!?
*Grian died of guilt*
14:32 Somehow Scar just has the worst luck I've ever seen 😂 16:04 Grian seems like such a cinnamon roll but he lowkey scares me 😅 Grian: "Im so tired & never doing these boxes anytime soon-" Scar: 20:39 22:30 Love these little bonus clips
OH NO!!!
wait why not just get the armor and books then go to the enderman farm to get the levels lol
grian said that if I dont do anything, there will be an apocolypce. strangly familiar.
When Scar was saying “Mmm yep, your spot is looking reaalllly goood” (or something like that) He made it sound like a mom’s reaction to seeing their 6 year old’s “Amazing base”
can anyone say "karma"
"if i dont get something done by the time this oxidizes the server will result in a apocalypse"  me whos watched the whole season: wait a minute
Grian: If I don't get something done by the time this oxidizes, the server will, result in an apocalypse Season ending: Moon crashes into the earth
"A little bit of wonk."
woohoo copper dam :-)
F for scar
Me: JUST USE AN ENDER CHEST AND PUT YOUR SHULKERS IN IT
They say dying to the overworld void is the one of the rarest ways to die. For the Hermits it’s just another Tuesday
Ahh yes the Aussie accent is probably the best
Instead of you telling him for 400 diamonds you should have just told him for you to go on your plot
What if the Boatem Spirit is the moon?
I'll be honest; during the deepslate mining time-lapse my attention was fully on the growing crystals in that geode.
grian sounds like mufasa
"if i don't get something done by the time this oxidizes, the server will result in an apocalypse"
You can survive the void with enchanted golden apples.
14:13
scar: *punch him off :)*  Grain: *SCAR* >:((  (13:57) (always put the time <3)
This is the first time I've heard the phrase 'eat your heart out.' Is this an English thing? As in British English.
“now these two were a little bit to straight so I added a little bit of ✨ *w o n k* ✨
The bank NEEDS, NEEDS to be GRIANGOTTS
He says that it takes forever to get deep slate but I used an iron pickaxe to get deep slate for my entire castle so idk what he’s talking about
added a bit of 💅✨w o n k✨💅
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Seeing everyone's builds just make me sad because I can't be as creative as the hermits :(
21:25..... Yea
Where do they get all the elytras from
lol finally found the tiktok sound
16:40 NOT STONKS
We do a little lagging
Foreshadowing to the end of hermitcraft 8 at 21:27
Season 7 : creative builds and stuff Season 8 : B O A T E M,  T R E E S
put a wonk on it
5:29 Grian regrets EVERYTHING
Scar: I DON'T HAVE ROCKETS  it was qt this time grian realized, he **quack** up
I know this isn't a recent video but I just had to say this: I think greens logic is flawed if he makes that amount of diamonds that he was going to sell it for, He's going to make that and also make the profits from the deep slate, So it is worth it. Am I correct?
"Those are just the things in the fine print that we never read" is such a good line holy heck 👁👄👁 Scar could definitely play the role of a villanous business man or something in a movie.   He's definitely one of my favorite hermits, especially with how he was peeking out of that bedrock hole 😂
Ooohh! So that's hot the "Scar build here!" Thing got started! I'd only seen this from Mumbo's perspective, that it's intended as a way to help get Scar to stop overthinking is actually really cool! Even if that's just one of your motives I think that's really cool of you.
21:28 WHAT DID YOU NOT FINISH GRIAN /lh
Scar is such a treasure.
2:55 "the big bank or something"? SERIOUSLY? A man builds Diagon Alley and doesn't immediately know that only Gringotts can go at the end? And now that I'm writing it, if he MUST continue the puns, *GRIANgotts* is RIGHT THERE. Scarivander's Wand Shop, Mumbo's Magical Maladies... I'm sure there's something to be done with Impulse and Pearl, too, I'm just drawing a blank.
not sure if you're still looking for a name for the alley seeing as the season is over but what about "Grain Alley"?
Mumbo has giant chai and he is CEO Pearl has beautifull terrain she is architect Iscan has industrial area he is industrial manager Grian has market diagonally, he is marketing manager Scar has nothing, he is salesman. Ties well with boatem inc.
Grian-gotts!!! Instead of gringotts
When I saw one of your videos it became a every day thing
Draigon Alley-And use your dragon egg
"Oh no, it's lagging into my inventory!"
Scar is so jumpy 😭😭😭
“These two were actually a bit too straight so I’ve added a bit of wonk” just know that this line has become a tiktok audio I hear quite often
Can you please call the cave “the hobbit cave”?
9:28 THAT'S WHERE THE AUDIO CAME FROM XD
2 diamonds per stack
Did Grian not manage to do anything before the copper oxidised cause I feel like the apocalypse did happen
that is allot of lag
The physical pain i felt when both of them into the void 😭
Call it alley cave
21:00 "If I don't get something done by the time this oxidises... the server will result in an apocalypse."  Oh, so that's why the Moon fell.
Its the best day everrrrr
Its the best day everrrrrrrrrrrr
"it was a little bit straight so i added a little bit of WoNk" that describes me
The name should be mount grian
lol why the heck is there a potato in the ad
Digrian alley
I'm in your inventory...  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Does anyone know what song this is at 19:07?
9:25 I was watching season 8 because I haven't until now and BOOM I hear a TikTok sound 🤣
Every season has an episode titled losing everything it's so funny
Items moving by way of lag.... I can see that happening lol
he should have made each one of the buildings a shop for different things like the train carriages
21:27 that aged well
i thought that scar would punch grain and that how he would die
“If I don’t get something done by the time this oxidizes,  the server will result in an apocalypse.” -Grian, 2021
15:00 13:00 13:55 14:15 14:35 15:15 16:00 16:35 11:25
“Grian, what inspired you to mine deepslate for a shop?” “Money”
My mega base is a 10×10×10 wood box
"Nobody wants to collect it[deepslate], Including me. Bit I am going to do it anyway, for the diamonds!" -Literally any major store owner in a nutshell
I swear Scar is the most easily spooked Hermit 😆
I was going to say to call the alley Biagon Alley because its boatem and diagon but then I realised I was to late
21:27 "If I don't get something done by the time this copper oxidizes, this server will experience an apocalypse". Turns out this was all a foreshadow to the end of the season.
what episode was this on scars channel
He's gonna need alot more "Perhaps You Perished Parcels"
I’m not sure if you noticed Grian but at one part ( 13:38 ) you said “hole’d on” near the boatem hole
“If  don’t get something done by the time this oxides there will be an apocalypse” wait… THE MOON WAS AN APOCALYPSE?!
“These two are a little too straight so I added a little bit of ✨ *wonk *✨”  “These two are beginning to become a little bit *too* stable”   In my opinion, honestly the best quotes of this video
Rewatching this after the end of season 8... was there forshadowing in this episode?
v
21:27 "If I don't get something done by the time this oxydizes, the server will result in an apocalypse"  AHA! So you were the culprit behind the whole moon thing! :O
21:25 if only he knew
“If I don’t get something done by the time this oxidizes, the server will result in an apocalypse.” Oh no...  Edit: I just realized everyone is saying this lol nvm
13:57 has to be a sound from the lion king🤠🐈
"If I don't get anything done by the time this oxidizes the server will end in an apocalypse" i--
Ahh yes a fan made version of the 2nd battle of the hoover dam, the 2nd making of the copper dam.
the music you play in the timesplases are always a bop
21:27 We finally know what caused the moon apocalypse
21:30 interesting…
2:46  Gringotts bank?
"If I don't get something done by the time this oxidizes, the server will result in an apocalypse"  Here we spy Grian predicting the future.
I'm watching this after he probably named it already but of he doesn't name the alley "horizontalley" I'm not gonna be impressed
The fact that he lost it all in episode 13 make superstitious people even more convinced lol
Grian: An apocalypse will happen if this oxidizes before I am done Later Moon Big Grian: This is Doc's fault.
21:32 This aged poorly, didn't it?
13:58 such a dramatic SCAAARR!!!!!
Possibly the (G)alleyway or just the (G)alley
Orthogon Alley
Grian all do respect, please cover up the boatem hole :,)
The alleyway build reminds me of the Chelsea area in newyork.
9:28 I FOUND IT I FOUND THE TIKTOK SOUND YESSSSSSSS
DIAGRIAN ALLEYWAY!!!!
Don't take my nickname silky
Why do you have three PickAxes??????
Should've called the alley "Diamond Alley"
Griaaan you’re so mean 😂
at least scar got this curse of binding player head off by dying..rite ?
the goodbye never gets old
mumbo to copper: a small price to pay for beacon and emeralds
Grian hermitcraft 8: I’m gonna do it for the diamonds. Grian Hermitcraft 7: Sad barge noises
“This only got me six boxes of deepslate”.    ONLY!?   THATS SOOOOOOO MUCH!?
“These two were a little too straight, so I added a bit of wonk”  If that isn’t a way to describe me, idk what is
I love that grian is a potterhead
I love how this server is a bunch of grown adults laughing their heads off at a childrens game
Grain Avenue for the alleyway
16:03 I'm loving Grians sadistic manipulative side lol
7:45 Creeper is going shopping :D
A name for the ally: Boatem Bulavard
Dia-Grian_Ally
Now these two were actually a bit to straight so I added a bit of WONK
anyone else see the resemblance between scars base and the Ninky Nonk from In the Night Garden?
just watching a lot of these episodes with a big pot of tea and a book is honestly the best way to not work on school and just have a break for myself
Dam, this looks awesome!
Cool
I love how one of the builds in the alley is like a mega base to me but it’s just like a 15th of Grains  “it’s not a mega base”
I love the idea of curse of binding plus mending but i don't thing its possible
ONLY!?!?!?!?!?
I have an idea, make tons of perhaps you perished that way you could have many in case of an accident
👍
No need to sacrifice people when they sacrifice themselves
2:25 Grian: WITHOUT BREAKING MY NECK *takes half a heart of damage*
Deepslate the block that makes a Minecrafter scream
the ally way could be called the cubed corridor
I think these houses are WONKers!     god..why do I do this
so no one’s gonna talk about the “these two were a little bit too straight, so I added a bit of *w o n k* “ line?
My favorite part was watching Scar try to read those signs :/. Like I’m not even dyslexic and I️ had trouble reading them. Also I’ve been laughing so hard it’s making my headache worse
I took a zig when I should’ve zagged - Scar
So basically, Diagon Alley
how does grian do that  slwo motion helicam type view he is working so how does he do that  5:30
"You can't leave a man in a hole like this" "Hold on" What I heard: *Hole-d on*
Grain: Alley Me: VAlley 😌
That’s one wonquy ally!
force mumbo to make a machine to stock your items
Gavey Alleyway ?
I love how it’s all fun and games when they die, I was playing all day yesterday and died probably around 16 times from getting shot into or falling into lava and BOYYY I was not laughing!! Hahah but watching them continuously die with a whole lot more/better stuff makes me feel better lol 😂😂😭
Grian you should build Griangots Bank at the end of the alley!
2:00 basically: “If you build YOUR mountain on top of MY mountain, we’ll have a *DOUBLE* MOUNTAIN!”
Death count Grian: 100  Scar:100000000000000
13:57 the lion king be like
Oh you went to york, Cool!!
Suffering scar is fun
Boo! THIS WAS ALL A JOKE!! LOL
2..
4:45 Grian: look how slow this is Me who uses stone pickaxe to stripmine to save resources:😳😳
Call the alley diamon alley another pun
Booties -"grian"
3…
13:38 missed opportunity for "hole-d on"
I like the music
9:30 a little bit of ✨WONK✨
Bruh Unnamed Alleyway is a pretty good name.
oh darn my server is sooooooooooo lagy 12:00
Grian is great at building... As long as you only look at it from the front side. That's why he's the master of presentation! Not because he is great at presenting, but because the backside is nonexistent compared to the rest!
Luckily non of you had Netherite equipped.
The Law of Scar got you bad in this one
When ur chilling at your home watching grians new hermitcraft video and see your house in the picture he took inspiration from
14:54 Grian using psychological warfare.
"so i added a little bit of wOnk"   Favorite line ever IN HISTORT.
so its from here the wonk sound is from
9:28 is the viral ‘added a bit of wonk’ sound on tiktok for anybody curious hahahaha
16:04 I love that little giggle
I have a name for your alley:griagon alley
Don't you hate it when rockets don't work in the void?
Okay for anyone who watched last life this will make scense, and i have to say this.  I JUST GOT A ADD FOR A DRINK CALLED 'AHA' -
9:29 I LITERALLY STARTED WATCHING THESE EPISODES IN A RANDOM NOTE AND RAN INTO THE TIKTOK SOUND
bowling alley? to BOATEM ALLEY pun?
That’s no starter base it’s a giga start
Diagrian alley
DiaGRIAN Cave
I needed to yous a puffer 10 times i hope all of you dont need one sorry for wasting you time
Please call the alleyway Griangon Alley
Galleyway??????? Idk 🤔🤔 lololololol 🤣🤣😂😂
I knew that the first image was ollivanders but then I saw the second Image… There’s so many places in London and England and I think I recognise where that image is. I’m not English btw but I am British
Wow grain how rude
Oh my thanks for the laighs
scar: hey you know what for my starter base wagon theme  scar a few episodes later: MY LIFE IS WAGON
How about calling it Alley Oop(s)?
Wait I messed it up lol
Yeah
Grain is out here complaining about how slow it is mining deep slate while I’m watching this mining thousands of blocks with my stone pickaxe.
Under Alley?
Grian's copper dam is basically like aging cheese and fermentation of food and other stuff
Sorry I’m late but I know what you can call it  PENTIGON ALLEY (not being mean I’m just happy I thought of it)
you better build a dragon under the bank if you build a bank lol
Griagon alley
Scar: You can't leave a man in a hole like this
Man I can feel it the G-Train is gonna be the next barge
-breaks neck- alright we did some G-train wo-
DiaGRIAN Alley should be what the alley is called
13:57 Scream button
11:14
that stuff recovery timelapse song was fire though
You can use gold pickaxe it is much faster than diamond if you're  mining for deapslate
Congratulations to Grian for 7M subscribers!
Scar: I want 4 more of these Grian: No Scar: 400 diamonds  Grian: _Hmm_
this is where the "added a little bit of wonk" came from, i knew it was grian but i didnt know what video
13:37 HOLE-d on
ok but like what if you called it the gralley since both it means grian alley and gravel alley, since its all cavey and grainy
HEY, SCAR, BUDDY, PAL! PLACE YOUR SHAG *moan* HERE!
Canonically, Grian has two brain cells and it’s my favorite recurring joke
Lunar ally
Dooragone alley
How about put gringots at the end?
5 am and I’ve been binging Grian vids 👏🏾  Butt what if “The Alley” 👀  Was called “The Galley”  hmmm 😗  Gotta say it slooow “The Galley” Grian has the G-Train and maybe so “The Galley” 🙃👍🏾
Wonk
Scar: 400 diamonds of course  Grian: you've had my curiosity but now you've got my attention
Grian: “Doesn’t that have curse of binding on it?” Scar: “No, n- *dang it*”
I honestly think that it would be funny if grian calls the alley “the galley” cos why not
lol scar is dtimewit
only 6 boxes/ 3 double chests of deepslate
You should name it Midaq Alley and create a whole in depth story of intrigue, romance, and corruption.
name it Griagon ally
Ok sometimes I think he say's that it is so small and he practically made a new cave
Grand and scar dying in the boatem hole had me ridiculously laughing my qrse off on a bus and people were looking at me like I am mad
Mumbo spells swag, grian says shac and we all read shag
Grian is an effective torturer
When scar previously kills you in the boatem hole and then you try to save him and die in the process:
Call it the ginnel seen as though York was an inspiration ginnel is a yorkshire word for alley
13:37 scar: "Ya can't leave a man in a holl like this!" Grian: "HOLL d on"
w O n K
13:38 hehe HOLE- don Lmao
name it city of caverns
This “lag” is not going away any soon
Of course! Giant mossy chairs are for giant mossy people!
8:05 its sounds like autotune HHHHAA
wonk
THE PLACE IN THE BACK IS GRINGOTTS!!!!!!
Concave alleyway Like if you think it's a good name (day one)
Scars the glue like Newt from Maze Runner.
Divans alley ( skyblock players know what I mean)
2 diamonds for a stack of deep slate is the heck no it's not I sold a stack of coal not coal blocks for 7 diamonds
LAGG MY GUY
Name it mountain ally
UHHH 15:03 THE BEDROCK ABOVE SCARS HEAD CRACKED A BIT. SCAR IS GOD
18:06 Scar: at what point do i break it to ya Griat: wot Scar i had a tridnt grian o noh
a Season later and Scar is Still going to be doing the back of Grians Base
The last building in your alley base should be called FinAlley
Anyone else see the pattern here? Grian only builds shops that are 1. Vehicle based 2. Stock grindy items 3. Have lucrative profits  Not to mention they stock boxes as well
Day 2 of telling Grian that he should call the alley Griangon Alley
*wonk*
I- I dont think that spells swag...
Grian: ONLY SIX shulker boxes  Me: doesn't even have shulke r boxes
Call the alley way the wonked up alley
16:32 CHAOS
Nobody  No one ever  The LGBTQ community:  "Now, these two were actually little bit to straight, so I added a bit of wonk"          (I cant be the only one who thought of that-)
Lol the way you and Scar just started screaming while you died...
why don’t they use nether ute
If you really think about it, "The Alleyways" has a certain ring to it. I like it.
Scar jumped off the cobblestone, idk why Grain is getting stuff for him
Ahh lag I was lag and also lag but in a more serious note lag is the worst thief EVER
Hi I'm a new subscriber I love this video pls make more videos like this
he should make the copper dam into an actual dam! Like with water behind it so when he replaces it we get a cool waterfall!
why didnt scar used /kill?
it should have been tri dent in my pocket
Please please please make grian-gotts it’s to good to not use
name it the "wonkey way"😀
"Huh, Scar seems to have been missing for a few days..."  @13:00 *Ah.*  * _Torments Scar as blackmail_*
First look from the factory i immediately knew it was Wonkas factory
it needs to be called Griagon Alley
It should be called the valleyway
Grian’s just a master at killing Scar isn’t he?
DIAGRIAN ALLEY!
grian:we have a little wonk me:wat the hell is wonk
Ally name = GRINALLY
wom
really nice save with the SWAG*, G....
Why would you jump in all of these recent videos were good but now it's horrible
Don't pay scar back, he pushed u in the boatem hole a few episodes ago
title: i lose everything (again)! *me,on the part where grain is near the void* Wait.. *scar punches grain in the void* NOOOOOOOOOO GRIAN- *grian is safe* *internal panik to when will he die*   me when he is going after scar: yeah this is where he dies  *death*  YEP
Seriously you threatened scar to build in a certain spot
THE TIK TOK SOUND OMG
Litterally making their own caves and cliffs in the caves and cliffs update
Doesn't he own a basement  or something
callthe ally the-agonally just say it fast >:3   it aint stealing the brand if its not the same name xD
if i was scar i would simply never forgive grian i think /hj
All I could think of when you said you don't know how to call it. "Diagon Alley" [Diagonally] Immediatelly my thoughts were on calling it something similar, or rather, something totally opposite. "Vertic Alley", "Horizont Alley" or something like that, something with a similar vibe
Scar’s trident lagged into the Boatem Hole.
9:29 wait, he stole that from tiktok!
4:15 Grian became Eminem
I'll bet you could buy tridents from Etho and sell them to Scar and still make a profit
That backfired so fast...
I realize this is dating myself; everytime someone goes off on Diagon Alley my brain wants to ignore them, and starts singing Portabello Road. ><
The wonk tiktok audio <3
Diagrian alley
Has Grian actually died from any thing that wasn't  A. Ender crystals Or B. The void?
Episode 13, a series of unfortunate gri-vents
scar is like the the video that someone gets stuck in the bedrock like "Oh No I gOt StUcK iN bEdRoCk"
There are lots of indie windows in this episode and i love it
9:05, yoo grian why you making the twin towers (no disrespect to 9 11, just thought of it)
“Now these two were actually a little bit too straight, so I added a little bit of wonk.” Ah. So this is where that came from.
“I think we need to get a little more elaborate, more clear about this message”   Me: *builds message out of glass*
Grian making scar build the back of things seems familiar
He is making diagon ally
Grian, you should replace deepslate with "limited time offers" whatever... totally NOT junk you think will sell.
They really need a rule to leave their stuff outside anytime they're going to the Boatem hole xD  This happens way too often
I FOUND IT 9:29 now these two were actually a little bit too straight, so i added a little bit of wonk~
✨wOnK✨
The deepslate car of the G-Train. Or, in other words, “It costs that much ‘cause it takes me f***ing hours”
Idea, move the G-Train in to a built king's cross inspired station. (So basically the G-Train is the hogwarts express.)
Man, the Boatem Hole is a menace.  Also why don't you just buy all the equipment and enchantments from the villagers and then use the Enderman farm for XP?  Seems like it'd be faster.
I _knew_ Scar was gonna hit Grian into the hole.  I just _knew_ it.  Even trapped in bedrock and desperate for help, he just can't resist knocking people into the hole.
You can call the alleyway the galleyway
Can we just appreciate how much work all these guys put into all of this? I mean, Grian spent 2 hours just mining DEEPSLATE and Mumbo must have spent forever on that awesome moss-stone-chair-thingy-ma-bob-covered-in-vines and all the other beautiful structures
Griagon alley should be the name of the alleyway
15:09 did anyone else see the bedrock crack
man im late but what about "the fineALLEY" as in like its going to be the last mega base hell build this season so it should ne the fineALLEY hehe
Griagon Alley sounds about right 😉😃
Hello
grain you should make a sell shop instead of a buy one?
Missed opportunity: Tri-dent in my wallet
If you were in hermit craft 7 still you would be able to smelt the pickles from the pickle jar an get green dye
Some people have more than one base, in fact you could probably have like five of them on a single server
Griagon alley sounds like a good name for the alley XD
9:28 iconic
Diagrian alley!!!
Caveanalley
you should follow the same theme with diagon alley being diagonally and name it horizont alley or verdic alley
All of the Hermits keep making holes and mountains- which sounds a lot to me like "caves and cliffs"  Between you and me, I'm thinking the Hermits just can't wait for 1.18, so they're putting 1.18 in 1.17 XDD
Call it Grain Lane
I can't vouch for anyone else but personally I would love to see a full video of how Grian gathers the gear and enchants it and all that! No timelapses, just the raw footage and maybe Grian verbally walking us through the process.
Wonkally? Grandally?
@ 16:34 play lmao f
Diagonally xD
Poor Scar gets scared so easily. I mean like same to be completely honest... Someone touches my shoulder even if I knew they were behind me and I jump out of my skin.
That lag, I'm tellin' ya, keeps doing weird things on Minecraft
You Could Call It Diagonally instead of Diagon Alley.
Place spore blossoms in the alley it would make it look magical
Tunnel bores are def the way to get deepslate !
I would call it griagon ally
Scar actually walking into the void Grian broke the block and then Scar walking off the platform
Call it wonky alley
Griagon Alley lol
Grian’s laugh is contagious lmao
22:32 Scar sounds like Mickey Mouse laughing
these buildings were looking a little too straight so I added a bit of ✨WONK ✨
Call it the Galley
Griagon alley
how is this type of music( timelaps) called?
grian pls at some point can you do a setup tour
I just hate it when you made many progress and they are gone very sad
How about Galley Alley
Carcar2824 says to name it “Wonk Alley” since you’re all about the wonk ;)
Grian, scar walked into the hole too.  He would have inevitably fallen and died because he walked the wrong way.
Season 6: Poultry Man Season 7: Door Stealer Im waiting for season 8.
9:29 is a popular (ig) tiktok sound :)
TLDR never ever help a friend
Grion alley
16:39 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨🙌🏼🙌🏼🤌🏻👌🏻
forseen, yet funny all the same xD
Wonky Way is looking great.
What happened to the Cave Of Temptations?
This episode had me in tears laughing xD
I only watch grian because he builds good.. other than that.. oh my god.
Yeah you should play Halo like what Daniel berrier said
Alley name, because it will have your farms to stock shops for producing Diamonds: Dia 'Mond Alley.  Just say it with a pause after dia and mond pronounced the same as in Diamond.  :)
You should call it the "Mountainous Housing-ness"
Technically, he jumped in before you broke the cobbelstone 😁
Thally
griagonally
can we please just stay calm
13:14  THAT- I WHEEZED WHEN SCAR SAID THAT
Griagon Ally
You should call the g train the grianwarts express
am i the only one who mad about how he said " *only* six shulker boxes *full* off deep slait"
f
Why not call the alley the G-alley? or Galley? Ya know.... G for Grian. And fits with the whole boat theme
The Wonky Walkway is the name of the gameere
Since when does it take hours to get a god set? I guess he was talking about the levels or something, but I’m pretty sure impulse has a really fast afk farm for that soo…
Make grian warts please it would make my hermitcraft season
(Real)
9:28
The alley should be called diagon alley
Lmao 400 diamonds got grians attention so fast I can't breathe 😂
i laugh at your hermitcraft so hard all the time. like i havent laughed this hard in a while.
Giagon Alley
every season I watch until around episode 30 and then have forgotten to keep up until i notice the next season has started so i'm going to try and keep up this time.
Name for the base: Ortogon-ally, because blocks in minecraft connect 90 degrees from each other. :)
“only 6 boxes of deep slate”
You should make a extra charge like 2 shulker boxes of stuff = 220 dim  3 shulker boxes of stuff = 320  4 shulker boxes of stuff = 420
I think the ally should be named 'The Ally Which Shall Not Be Named' referencing He Who Shall Not Be Named aka Voldemort, and because of how long it took to name it
I love your videos ❤️
it's the diagon cavern
name it polygon alley
Instead of diagon alley call it buy-again alley
He should have named the trident “tri not to die again”
Getting flashbacks to the empire knees you in the face
G cave?
The Alley should be named "Kermit Alley"
I love how every so often a mountain pops up in these hermitcraft seasons 😂😂😂
16:05 made my day
so, for the deepslate mining: you got 2 stacks of diamonds plus 6 shulkerboxes of deepslate in 2 hours. you sell the deepslate for 3 diamonds for 2 stacks. that comes out to 243 diamonds for the deepslate (which is almost 4 stacks)  6 stacks (or maybe 5 if its a really bad day) of diamonds in 2 hours is still pretty profitable
"These 2 were actully a little bit too straight so i added a litil bit of wonk" lgbtq: in our languge this means somthing to us!
wonk alley?
Hermionaly 😂
wonky ally
Why don't you make a small portion of your H7 mansion in your base
Grian: About to start a timelips  Us: Yes
pls call it graingotts
When grian said apart from breaking my neck I Burst out laughing
WONKY WAY
Grain street  I meant to say grain
Tri-dent in my wallet wouldve been a better name for the trident
You can name it Gway
Roses are red violets are blue of course Scar dies in the boatem hole and Grian does so, too.
What textures does grian use?
Grian should name the ally Side Show Ally Idk just sounds good
My life is wonk
Ayy grian u teached me ti build the best builds i can build
This reminds me of the alleyway grian built in evo smp
17:20 in fairness, he jumped off…
W o n k
Call it grainigonally
"Well well well, if it isn't the consequences of my own actions"
ahh... dame lag
On a airplane I lost my only brain sell
13:37 holed on the season of puns innit?
i know this is late but he's lucky he has 2 brain cells because i dont have any
I don't think Scar over thinks.  I think Scar has been over stimulated by Boatem.  So are you and so is Giga Botem.  Plan it well. This is huge.
Now on another episode of Grian accidentally kills Scar...
The GrianGone Alley
I like Scar’s wagon village 😃
Name for the alleyway: Grallyway
wow, Dia-Grian Alley is turning out really nice.
I've thought of another one... Diamond Alley, BUT you have to pronounce each syllable in diamond. Di-uh-mond Alley.
You make the dumbest mistakes
What’s the sound at 18:21
Please build a dragon on the bank
The part where he's trading with the music makes me think of Pokoyo
Wha about the galley way like grian and alley and galery cuz it like an art alley way!  Thoughts?
Scar, should build everywhere
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
When’s 3rd life 2?
Are you my mom or dad
⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱⛱
Yeah but yeah but at the end but OK
Horizont-alley
Grian hasn’t uploaded in a weak(that’s rare well unless he is on holiday) when I posted this he does did a new video LOL 😂
Scar build here scate. Build here scare biuld here if you give me 1 enderpewrl i go biuld there
I'm sorry? The base of Scar will be in the sky not the mountain. On the cloud.
Still no episode 14..... ima gues it will come out today ( 8th September 2021)
New video at 00:00 IST 9Aug confirmed                  -InfoTechGamerz
It has been a week usually it's slightly less than a week so grian probably has been byssy or has a lot of editing or something that takes extra time maybe a lot of building
"look how slow this is" meanwhile, im using an unenchanted diamond pickaxe...
haha not me coming back every hour to check if grian uploaded 😳
The alley should be called backless alley, get it? Because none of the buildings have backs!
Grian!!!! It has been a month since you uploaded!!!!!!
thank you for making these videos, they have helped me through the times where i struggled with mental health over the last few years
Is he on a vacation
Griangotts petition
We are sending a messsage to scar me: not this again
Is he dead??
G-man are you on vacation I need your videos to keep my sanity
It's been a week
He still hasn't posted yet?!?! Whyyyyyyyy , it's been 1 weeeeeeekk?!?
So, Grian when I watch even ONE of you'r episodes of hermitcraft I want to hire you to build me something. Man how you learned this building skills!!?
Will there be another war in this season like in S7  mycelium resistance
Call the ally gally:)
Plz upload alot I really demonatized
Griagon ally
Hey uh Grian are you ok?
Next episode!!!!!!
grain upload pls
THE NEW EPISODE IS TAKING SO LONG😭😭😭😭
Did he die irl
Dyeagain alley
2 stacks = 3 diamond 1 stack = 2 diamonds say someone was to buy 6 stacks and they payed for price of 2 stacks, so 3 diamonds every two stacks, you would get 9 diamonds but if one was to buy for the price of 1 stack you would gain 12. So the best thing to do would be to buy in the price of 2 stacks
Brian I have a pen idea hue fan by the way so the idea is you can be the joker nut instead of joker u can be the (jaker ) for legal reasons of course and then u can be tatman’s ( mumbo ) enemy
If the inspiration for the build was Diagon Alley surely this should be called Vertic Alley.
Aaaaaa it’s been a whole week since you’ve made a video aaaaaaaaa
Noice 6.9 million subs
"We are here to send scar a message"
Yo Grian when’s merch coming back?
"wonk"
Whats that Grian?  Grian: VOID VOID VOIIIID
Deepslate looks like bedrock !!
What happened to "let's play" serie?!
could i be called the Wonk Walk? or The broadwonk? or maybe even Wizard of Wonkz?
It's so frustrating seeing him losing stuff
whens the next vid
U should make  the bases normally and connect them in a giant underground cave
Hermitcraft
Hermicraft
I broke my right elbow XD
At what point do they just start taking off their gear when they go to the Boatem Hole?
House leaning on a smaller house
When I first saw the title, I was like “Again??” I think the boatem hole has claimed too many lives this season.
I DEMAND A SEASON 2 OF 3RD LIFE
Grain if you wanna mine depslate or stone or whatever faster tap it instead of holding it, keep clicking it like keep tapping the button you use to mine
Put floating candles in the alleyway
All hail to the Minecraft king The Boatem Hole
a few questions when is this seasons variation of a  secret base and when is Hermitcraft war 3
*insert Grian running away from fanbase saying horizont - alley and vertic - alley here* Grian: Oh no :( Here it comes!
Grian upload now please
Should call it diamondgone alley
There are few things in this world cuter than a wild Scar stuck in a hole he can't mine himself out of.
Where is 3rd life season 2
Please let hermits rent them for diamonds and discounts
Diagrain alley
Don't worry Grian, I am sure you will name the alley eventuALLEY
whens the next video?
I WISH HE POSTED SO MUCH MORE OFTEN
I think that the G alley would be a pretty good name for alley
is grian okay?
People that are waiting for episode 14 like this comment👀
WHEN EPISODSE
this server is really laggy
Everyone be patient for the next episode
16:34 lol Scar just walk off the cobblestone
Where grian gone :(
Since the Alley doesn’t have a name yet, you should call it Horizont Alley or Vertic Alley- keep the play on words from the original Diagon Alley
Can you make a plantation style mansion
Please post something
why aren’t you uploading
Grian!!! I always enjoy your video!!! Thanks for your the best video that I aver see in my life!!!
yes
CAN U POST SOMETHING I’ve been wait for A WEEK
He will not upload a vedio now
GROIN WHERE ARE YOU
Be patient for ep14, a high quality episode is better than a rushed one!
Griannnn where r uuuu
I hate deepslat
So green just how long would it take you to make three perhaps you perished boxes just curious.? 🦝
yo
Please bring back Poultry Man 🐓 (not saying you have anything to do with him)
15:04 Is it normal to get the breaking animation  on bedrock for a moment or is it just the lag?
Grain i have a suggestion what you name the allyway its “Hollow ally/allyway” or “G (Grian) way/allyway”  or “wonky ally”
Is 3rd life S2 gonna start? (Autumn now)
What about the Gally? The definition may not be anything special, but you don’t really have to think about that..It sounds like a fun combination of Grain and Ally though! 😆
Call the alley the vertic alley, like diagon alley but a different direction
Does anyone see anything About grains subs? people now don’t understand but when I commented this grian had 6.9 million subs
Congrats on 6.9 mil
Why don’t you call the ally “grain station alley”
You should name the bank grain-gotts
The bank should be called griangotts
DUDE WHEN WILL U UPLOAD A VIDEO
I've got the perfect name for the alley way, "The Galley Way"
Hey. I don’t actually watch your videos much… just enough to know you’re safe for my Minecraft obsessed 10yo to watch, but I wanted to say thanks for turning my reluctant reader onto Audible. I can’t tell you how damn delighted we are that he’s getting interested in books because of you.
Brian the grian
randomly leaves for a week?:/
Looks like Grian Needs to finish the Diagon Alley
Wonky alley.
[Grian has gone missing]
Confirmed he's dead lol
as a reference to evo name it downtown boatem <3.
I want to play hermitcraft with you but I don't know if can and I can't find a "hermitcraft" on the server but it I can play, I'm not the best builder but I can build decent buildings.
And this is why you do not mess with the void.
Then is the chicken man coming back
Hey Grian!! I'm a bit late but I have a good idea for your alley name!!! Because it's based on Diagon Alley and it's in minecraft why not call it Diamond Alley? It might not fit too well appearance-wise but you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. Also, since you always make such great shops you usually have quite a few diamonds. And last season you made a lot of diamond builds and decorations! If you already have an idea, though, then I can't wait to hear it! It was just the first thing that came to mind. (Btw, sorry for the long comment- It's almost a paragraph- TvT'") Anyway, that's all! Love your vids, great work! (Your builds are always awesome to see! ^w^)
Don't we need to re alert the mayor now???
name recomendation:  Wohnk St.
Maybe the alley can be called Boatem Alley, cause, why over think it.
Grain: NO OME WANTS TO COLLECT IT!!!.... including me But!ima do it anyway FOR THE DIAMONDS!!!! Grian:oh we've already hit diamonds....  me: GRIANNNN JUST HURE MUMBO TO MAKE YOU A DEEPSLATE MINER!! WE ALL KNOW THERES A. GETTER WAYYYYY
Brian you should name the ally way " diagon ally
Where is 3rd life??????
:)
We need third life 🙏
We need third life 🙏
We need third life 🙏
We need third life 🙏
I’m not gonna stop listening to ac dc until you upload
Scar being killed by Grian's prank. Seems all to familiar.
Where is new ep.
Barge 2.0
18:10
call it diagrain ally
currently missing grians episodes :’)
2:45 Maybe you could have an overgrown cove?
grian i got a pun for you "that's a axolotl lot"
Tbh Scar laughs like Technoblade
Not to mention I litarly build in creative minecraft and don’t even have the patience to make a “starter base” like scars and they do it in survival 😭
"I've been mining for 2 hours and that only got me 6 Shulker Boxes of deepslate" ....You mined almost 11,000 blocks Grian. That's 86.4 Blocks per minute. Like how much do you want them to give you??  Most of the 2 hours was spent looking for Deepslate and not mining it..
Whens the next episode
CALL IT GRIANGOTTS BANK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
just realized that scar walked off by himself!!
haven't been commenting lately but i asure you im alright
When I grow up I will be just like you
Grian:  builds new copper dam "I'll just leave this copper here to oxidize" Scar: grabs axe "Scars' free waxing service is back!"
The Galley?
Grian, as someone who loves mining deepslate, I will accept pay at a rate of 8 USD / Hour to mine it for you
Grian please mane it griangon alley
I typed “grisn” instead of “grian” when I searched for him ;—;
UPLOAD PLEASE
Griagonally!
You should make the deepslate car in the g train a car that you change every time you run out of stock.
Sooo I've had an idea. Why not scar just build in all the spots. Ok now hear me out. Just put big fluffy floating clouds and build on them and have bridges or something connecting them. Just a thought. 🤣
Grian, be careful how many bases you abandon the back of. Joel aka Smallishbeans said "I'm going to pull a Grian here and not finish the back of my base"
It’s been 6 days since this came out and we still don’t have another episode meanwhile mumbo has released two grian we better see some major updates in the next one.This is now a day counter since grian’s last hermitcraft video currently we are at 9.
The V-Alley
I think the trident name would be better as tri and believe you made me buy this
H._.
Grian when will you be uploading!?
Grian if you don't want everyone to blow up when someone elsewhere end crystal gets hit put a short one block wall of obsidian around each area
You should make a train car that always changes what’s in stock
Honestly, I think someone should upload an unedited video of them getting all of their stuff back. Not only would it get people to truly understand what it's like, it could give some people some tips to see how a pro does it.
The light couch bacteriologically meddle because wool analogically return barring a earsplitting argentina. shut, perpetual pharmacist
Just mine for diamonds within the deep slate. And sell the deep slate as bonus profits.
happy ep 14?
I legitimately felt the pain as they fell into the void.  I have never felt that.
if only he didnt cast scar in to the boatomvoid
I love this vid 🤩
Mumbo afk (animation)    ;)
grian upload it has been an entire week !!!
Is just me or does some of the minecraft buildings look better that the real picturesXD
A name for the alley way the gralley way or the gralley
Plz make a tip for making a wooden morden house
Upload plsssss
It's been 4 years
Upload plssss
Why aren't you uploading r you dead??
Farmaley
Pls wanna collab grian
G-a-gone ally
If the bank is gringotts why not make it your superstore called "GrianGots"
Name for the alley : Grainalley. And no I purposely wrote the wrong spelling
Plz upload again.
Inspiration for the alley was diagon alley, so why not call it horizont alley, or vertic alley
Stupidly dead again
Digon Alley
Diagrian alley
The fact that grian doesn’t have netherite hurts me
HOMIES UNITE. xXSlyFoxHoundXx HE HAS EARNED IT THROUGH THE YEARS OF MINECRAFT VIDEOS HE GAVE US! posted on all hermits videos
If you're looking for Wonk, Impulse's base has loads!  ... I'll see myself out.
Grain if you like dimonds than your a pesent
I have an idea. How about you put grass down the alley(like overgrowth) and call it the G Train Greenway
Horizont ally / Horizontally  same as Diagon ally in that its called Diagonally
Make the cave attach together with madara and hashirama as a reference to Naruto shippuden
GRIAN SEARCH UP LEGO TREASA SOMEBODY ACTUALLY MADE IT AND ITS AMAZING!!!!
Make a bank on the g train
I like how Grians response to anything bad is PANIK
Name it Dave
Season 2 of 3rd life coming soon I think!
I'm missing Grian right now 😔
YOU KNOW THEODD1SOUT!!!!????
You could name the all way graindonally but you pronouse the word grain like a grain of rice
GIVE ME EPISODE 14 ALREADYYYY AHHHHH!!!!!
Pesky bird
I love how grians base is just diagon alley.
3:13 istg this is the most bitter I’ve ever heard Grian sound about anything in all my years of watching him
Grain should just get a suit for being the richest man on hermitcraft already
Please use the   name g-way for the alley wayyy plzzz
WHO ELSE SAW SCAR ALMOST BREAK BEDROCK AT 15:05
👇Petition to name it Downton Alley
9:29 me
Grian + ally= grally
He should make poultry mans secret bunker
sorry what is wrong with me grian
I ment grain
imagine Brian joined the dream smp
names for the alley "wonk-way" "linear lane"
Are you doing more episods
The boatem hole is gonna be solely responsible for reducing diamond inflation on the server.
The big building at the back of your alleyway should be called the grain train Bank
How many pranks is Grain gonna pull on Scar that gets him killed
For the engine of the train it should be the hogworts train
POST MORE PLZZZZZZZ
Doesn't impulse sell that stone too??
KAAAAAAAAAARRRRMMMMAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mumbo: so why did you decide to start stocking deepslate? Grian: *money*
Grian be like: I did an oopsie... again...
Next Hermitcraft season the should invite the content creator “Smallish Beans”
Ngl... Grians builds this season aren't good at all. Like it took so many episodes just do make a starter house that wasn't even that big and these houses in the cliff type thing aren't good either, plain I'd even say. Pretty disappointing.
Why don’t you name it Diamond Alley? Btw I like your train!
Grian needs to be called grain it makes me happy
He is doing another sand and gravel thing
hey why don’t you sell the deep slate for 5 diamonds per stack because it’s such an exotic block
grian once again getting scar killed lol
Scars starter base is a megabase
BTW every one must subscribe to ...            OK so I might have for got how to spell your name but still he will give you all free diamonds because he is rich 😊
Impulse wanted Scars mega base to be pollution
Wy don't you make a dragon egg shop because you can rea Sumon the ender dragon ! Look it up? Price could be 50 diamonds 💎 per dragon 🥚🐣
You could name the ally way Hermit Ally
GrianGone Alley
I was rewatching season 6 and I realized that you used to put the hermit craft music in the beginning and end! Could you start doing it again?
grain be like from two hours of mining i only got six skulker boxes. me two hour of minng got me one shulker box of deepslate.
Grian being a noob trying to save scar just let him die it's not your fault he doesn't have rockets.
name it the diagonal ally
Grian: Lets wach scar mess  this up somehow... dies
Just hear me out   Griagon alley
Hey Grian. This might me too much work for you but what is on the corner on the left side of your base is a turn and you create another alley connected to the first on as a way to connect your and Mumbo’s bases
that was so funny!
Cause that's how the Mafia works!
You made a monument for tortoise in the evo server
What about build battles where do you get rid of those build swap with tortas mombo, scar
what is he using to make it smoother like a pack or a shader?
Why don’t you play with tortoise anymore why do you and the evil server I thought tortas was your best friend where did he go
And here I was thinking the hermits were the deadliest things on the hermitcraft server but no it's the stupid hole in the floor can someone cout how times the hermits have died in there.
You should build a bank at the end and parody gringotts .... GRIANGOTTS
if u can check loony a youtuber i think he would be good for hermitcraft
Call the ally gria gon ally
Can you do the mapping the place like in season 7 I liked the map is cool
Wait what's the point of a trident with just unbreaking and mending? It's basically an unenchanted crossbow like that. Loyalty, Impaling, riptide, and channeling give them all their functionality.
If you get very rich you can decorate it with diamonds and call it diamondally
What if you had a giant throne in the back of the alleyway?
Pro builder
Name it Grion alley
You should just call it "G-Alley" for the pun xD. Would be a fun name that makes no sense at all but fulfills the purpose of the pun season
THE NAME G-way
The G-Alley. (Galley)
can you make progress now
Who else thinks of diagon alley when you see Grian alleyway?🧙‍♂️🧙‍♀️
Name the ally gally
Grain ignoreing lava
Omg 😮 you are such a talented builder🍫🤣🙃
Call it Horizont Alley
12:05 definetly
Grian, you should put a stick dispenser in you Ollivander's Building, and change the name to "Wand"
you should call it the Mystic Alley
not sure if its too late ti name the alley, but i was thinking of having it called "wonk alley, as in "wonkily", similar to how "diagon alley" is a play on "diagonally"
xD everyone knows that items instantly despawn 64 blocks below the bedrock and that they need 0.5 seconds to be picked up again, so they would need to fall at least 30 blocks before they get picked up by Scar.
The Grally lol
Hmm I wonder If Mumbo's door would lag in to a inventory
10:43 oh no
Grian's got BadTimesWithScar this time.
I’m sorry if anybody has already said this but - Griagon alley
wheres ep 14??

So, in HP, the alleyway is called “Diagon Alley” which is of course a play on words with “diagonally” Why not call yours “Cardin Alley”? “Cardinally” in this case refers to just the four basic compass directions, as opposed to the diagonals from above

You should call the alleyway yarnham or old yarnum its from a game called bloodborne
The narrow  street also serves to make the buildings look bigger and more intricate. When you stepped back they look small...
You could rent out or even sell plots of land you know, since this is a "private" shopping district (maybe you could set it up like an open mall or something along those lines). You could also make a "super shop" or share profits (or both) with the other boetem hermits since you are... well... a SINGLE corporate entity.
So are you building diagon alley
Perhaps the weaselys house on top of the mountain of scar doesn’t settle up there?

Epic  video once again.
Barge 2 electric boogaloo
griagon alley
Hey Grian! If you still need a name, a lot of my friends and I have been calling your base "Die-Again Alley," in honor of the Did You Die Boxes ( & Perhaps you Perished Parcels.) Speaking of, maybe the next iteration could be "Alas, You Expired Packages"
The Galley Way! G for Grian of course 🙏🏻
name your alley DieGrian Alley and have a store where people pay for the privilege to kill you
"The grianGone Alley" "The **G**alley" "Grian's AlleyBase" "Gigalley" "The Grally" Hehe, names....
Grian build gringots bank for your house this season

no one going to talk about the typo in Pearls sign lmao
mumbo jumbo you are afk im gonna take that mustache away mumbo mumbo mumbo afk im gonnna take that mustache away
Grian I think you should a) name your alley horizont or vertic alley, B) call your big bank griangotts, and put all your diamonds in it.
Why don’t you build the “G office” at the end of the alley?
you gotta celebrate your 6.9M subs
How long until grian gets wrongfully demonetized because it said s.h.a.g not swag?
Name suggestion for the alley "hermit alley"  Edit: you could have you base also be a shopping alley

You should call it diagrian alley
Welcome to Diagon Alley

I would love to see a building that arches almost all over the ceiling
If you are going to make a bank at the end, PLEASE call it Griangots! I beg of you!
This has the right amount of wonk  :D
The Boat-Alley-Inn. Maybe at the end of your alley instead of there being a bank you could have an Inn. Also pronounced  Also the alley nam should just be The Boatem Alley.
16:31 you reap what you sow, Grian...
Instant KArma
Deepslate mining is hellish. Not even a Gold Pickaxe with Efficiency 5 and a Haste 2 beacon works, It's only 7% more efficient than diamond, and as they're both less than 6 ticks there's no difference due to the 3/10ths of a second delay between block mining. However if Haste 3 had been available... Then a Gold Pickaxe would be able to instamine Deepslate.
The Grambles Insted of the shambles
anyone watching this after hurricane ida🙋🏻‍♀️
DIAMOND alley should be the name
That g-alley is comming together nicely.
suggested name for base cavei’nally
Griagon Alley!!! Nice play on diagonally
Name it orthogon alley. (Diagon alley is diagonally, knockturn alley is nocturnally.. orthogonally…)
make the empty space gringotts and the train station kings cross for the g train
I think pearl meant to write "swag" but it looked more like "shag"  The difference is that you can have a shag in a swag, but not a swag in a shag
Grian: Lets watch Scar mess this up somehow Scar: i did it! (One second later) .XHMSYMSYJAYNATNWYJATJATJW5
Name the alleyway Diamond Alley but pronounce it di-ah-mond like Diagon alley in HP
I got a name for the alley: HermitgonAlley. Like Diagon Alley but with Hermit
You can sell raw iron to Cub
Downton Alley

Scar's giant head nod 20:40
‘I just need to activate my last two brain cells in order to speed stuff correctly’   Grian is literally making scar build right next to him so he wouldn’t have to do the back of the base. *This is something Sherlock Holmes would do if he played Minecraft*
Maybe adding a saloon into the alleyway?
Grian should make Grinngots bank and name it Griangots.
"I don't actually have rockeeeettttsssss" lmaooo

“Oi!! Scar, mate, buddy, pal!! Place your shag here!!”   *edits to swag.    Grian verbally speaks “place your shack here!”
Name the alley the  Balley/like maybe add avalley?? Idk

Ally name suggestion: Griagon Ally
I still say you should put a parkour course in the upper reaches and call it Die-Again Alley.
The cave ally
He could call the alley griagon alley.
14:29  THAT MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD, I WASN'T EXPECTING THE CAT HEAD
The graingots bank at the end
Backturn Alley Or  KnockBack Alley Or Griagon Alley
Why don't you call your base The Grally.
Copperdam alley
Grian should make a tavern in the  alleyway and name it The Cavern
Should call it 'Fantastic Ally' Grian
Name it the “Galley”
Watching Grian's videos makes me feel less lonely. ❤️
Idea for the G train- To try to sell people things door to door, make a loose caboose at their door that looks like a part of the train went of track and landed there selling a limited time offer.
Ally way name suggestion: grianville ally
Grian you should name THE ALLEY "Diagrian alley"
The all should be call nogaid ally it’s diagon ally backwards
Scar: Montresor i beg you!

@Grian I still vote for Griagon Alley.
When you’re trapped in bedrock, can you use trapdoors to crawl out?

Die-Again Alley promoting the Perhaps You Perished Parcels 📦   (Die Again Alley is not my original idea, I saw it in another video, but I def want that wonderful idea not to go unnoticed!!)
Grian and scar: oh no we're dying  Minecraft: THEN PERISH

You should name the alleyway the wonky wallyway
I feel the pain   I absolutely love deepslate but it's such a huge *PAIN* to mine for. It's so SLOOOWWW 😭😭😭  I kinda hope mojang makes a small update to mine deepslate a bit faster

Just saying that’s like the 10th time he took your becon
You should make a skin where the head is scars hat
The alleyway should be called deep street, cause it goes deeper and deeper
I think it will be more beautiful if you make this like  village with villager and bed so they don't escape and it look like the entire base lives
Digrian alley
The base alley should be called: diagrian alley
Ok but possible name for the alley: Griagon Alley.
The alleyway that should not be named

So much lag
16:33 talk about karma😆
16:33 It was as this moment Grian knew he messed up.
You could call the alley "the alley that  must not be named" as it is based on what people call voldemort and it plays on the fact grian can't think of anything to call it  Please like so grian can see this
Hey Grian if you ever make a storage system you should make it like Gringotts vault that might fit really well with your base :))
what about the weasley house?
because the inspiration for the alley was Diagon Alley, you should either name it Griagon Alley or Diagrain Alley
the galleyway?
Someone should really put an area in the void of the boatem hole that collects all the loot that is lost
Grian you need to make your pickaxe netherite and it will be much faster
Did i just see scar mine the bedrock?!?! 15:07
I love that you are literally building diagonalley and it fills my heart so much, before you showed the reference pictures I already knew what it was going to be, can't wait to see how you build it all. :)

You should build a gringgotts bank at the end of the alley and store all of your dimonds there
Name for the ally   Grigon ally
Call the alley the horizontalley

Me waiting  for the next episode to come out meenwhile I watch all of hermitcraft season 1-8 with mumbo instead

I didn't expect murder-suicide to be part of sending Scar a message. Kind of brutal.
Grian should name him the ally dragon ally cause he killed the ender dragon and got the egg
Name idea for the alleyway- diagon alley

lol Grian is at 6.9 million subs
He should call the alley "Dia-Grian Alley"  ending in "Grian-gotts"
It’s the shag for me
Scar won't settle anywhere he says: scar two weeks later, has built 18 mountains by hand established an empire and erected a record chest monster
the way scar jumped when Grian scared him
Idea the axalotol alleyway
Name the Alley “The Galley” Like so Grian can see
@grian logs mining should be done with a eff 5 gold axe with beacon that is almost instant mine
How about griagon alley for the name? Pronounced Gree - ah - gone

The ally should be named "The Grally" If you use this plz gimme a shoutout it would mean a lot

It's sad that he got one stack of dimand blocks in two moths and I got almost twenty dimand blocks in four days
You should call it Grianstone alley
Ok but consider: The Fin-Alley?? Get it?? Cause its probably gonna take the rest of the season??

A name for the ally way  The cave-away
How to get rich in hermitcraft  1. sell a variety of thing and/or biulding things. 2. Make it vehicle themed. 3. Don't involve a lot of Redstone
Grian please hear me out here can you make a boatem vault for the savings of the boatem inc.
Damn, that's a lot of copper!
Ngl when grain is should  call ot the ally finale
“These two were actually a little bit too Straight, so I added a bit of “Wonk”” - Grian 2021
Alley name: Griagon Alley
Grians base reminds me a little of Wizard City from Adventure Time
me and my friend found a  glitch/trap  to make it use a red stone timer  and  have a pit with a compositor at the bottom of it   then connect the  timer  to a sticky piston with a end rod facing down                            btw were kids  :)
You should call the alleyway boatem ally or boatem way 😁
“Grian breaks neck” Anyways.
NAME IDEA FOR ALLEY: blackstone street
WONK!! (its just a really fun word to say XD)
Probably a ridiculous idea, but what about Woodcobble Lane?
dia-grian alley hhehehe
Please call it candlewick cove
15:03 did scar break bedrock?
You should.   Call  the ally    The mountain ally
everyone: bisexual    grian: wonksexual
Extortion and treachery. The instant karma was perfect! BAHAHAHAHAHA There's a reason this is my fav show on youtube.
I love the buildings in the alley so much!!
The bank at the back of the alleyway has to be named Graingotts
You should try an efficiency v netherite pickaxe, it should be at least a bit faster
grian, I got a perfect name for the alley/a potential tavern in the alley: The Hang Inn
Grian are you married?  I'm wondering.
ïn iskalls video it looks like people have paid 1 diamond for 2 stacks of deepslate in your shop lol

Man I would actually like mining that deep slate. Mining is my favorite in Minecraft. I just put on a horror podcast and I have a cozy activity.
I would like to make the same alley name suggestion I made the first time which is “orthogon alley” since it’s a play on “diagon alley” but instead of being diagonal it’s orthogonal cuz Minecraft is a block game on a grid and all that
call it Alan the allyway
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ... It's all fun and games until the Void is involved! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
call your base downtown boaten because its under ground sort of
Everytime Brian loses everything, I wonder why he doesn't just go to Big Eye Pass n gas 🤔 to restock

Grain Alley XD
Scar *jumps off blocks into void* Grian *time for me to replace scars stuff* 😂
HermitCraft Alley?
Mojang: Instamine? Challenge accepted!
........Griagon alley
The big bank? Sounds like you should set up a storage unit down there that stores diamonds that anytime a boatem crew player gets diamonds they should deposit them into where they can sit safe until needed / calculated. After all, he who has the most diamonds in Minecraft wins. Right?
Damm boi thats a load if copper
Yo you could put diamond block spikes coming out of the cave ceiling
THE GALLEY
copper damn
wonk
@Grian Well, that's two more buildings for *Dia-Grian Alley*, good job!
Can I joinn   hirmitcraft
GRIAN. CALL IT DIAGRAIN ALLY. PLEASE.   👇
If it was me I would call the alley block burn alley
Alternate title: two hermits argue and trade for 22 minutes straight.
i think you should call it 667 dark alley
Call the alley the broken neck alley coz you break your neck every second
I feel like Boatem will never be the richest region this season just because they decided to have a giant hole in the center that they're constantly throwing all their stuff into.
Oh no ! He's going to build Griangotts !!!
15:00 did he just crack bedrock??
Potential name for the alley: Exception-Alley!
Put your brightness to moody and you can see how actually dark it is.......

16:43 Instand Karma😂
Hoping they would play among us again <3
Grian: Look how slow it is? Even with efficiency V! Me: *mining a full double chest with unenchanted iron pickaxes and no beacon*
It would be awesome if we could see more building comparisons between the alley builds and the IRL inspiration😊
Scar: "I'm not a cat, grian"
6.9 million subscribers keep it up grian
15:16 was so spongebob-like
I mean g train id nice and all….but….I’m just craving an alley inside a boat called a galley
I like how cub has also kinda technically become a part of giga base without being a part of boatm village just because he started  close to the others
I like how cub is kinda technical also a part of giga base
XD
Diagrian Alley
what is in 1.18 if you made a cobble gen under y 0 it generated deepslate
My friend told me conduit power's haste, stacks with a beacon never tested it, sounds fake, but just in case.
Amogus sus!?
If Grian doesn’t make a sorting system in a gringotts style bank then he has missed out on the best option he has for this base.
You should build the train going through your mega base
Personally, I think “The Alley” is a great name for your alleyway.
Name it Diagon Valley
THE WONK ALLEY
When do you decide to do 3rd life Season 2?
"look how slow it is", he says, while mining blocks in .3 seconds
"Diagonal Cranny"
Name the alley the “Galley” just a suggestion (i got it from removing r from gallery
Scar is such a cat. Like Grein is the pencil on the desk and Scar is the cat just watching
HI GRIAN
You should call your base diagon valley
Ah yes, Booties
You should sneak the Sherlock Holmes house into the alleyway
Galley -name of the alley

Turn the bit at the back  in to the hogwarts bank
Grian: this ones a little wonk and these ones- Me: are a little chonk? Grian were getting more stable so I added some wonk
It was just a prank
You should call your megabase Diagrian Alley or something similar
tip: instead of using ONLY books to get the amour back, you can actually use the etable for level 30 enchants! I know its only 2/3enchantments, but it does save a lot of emeralds and time!  EDIT: On my server, this method makes it around 1 hr for all my gear
What about G-Alley Way for a name?
The Alley should be named "Dripstone Alley"
Maybe "Griagonall Alley" ???
Grian should call the bank Griangotts
Of course you were obliterated. Ext name for dud or pop kirs
call it the Gally u know like ally and grian put together. idk
Olso Mr Cod's sub count is very nice
you should name your elytra Elie-tra or just Elie :D

Scar should get grians stuff and Grian should get scars stiff
Dia-Grain Alley
Grian

When the trolls get trolled. :D:D:D:D:D

The new Boots have a VERY nice name
you should call your base the G-iagon alley!
Does anyone else think grians turning into a bit of an arsehole?

LOL, Grian has 6.9 million subs xD
Also, the building on the corner looks a lot like that building in Prague that has almost the same shape. Its near the river and its in the very center of the city.
Alley O'Malley.  Malley because its 'alley' and 'mountain'.
Dia-grian alley
Grian  DiAmOnDs ArE fOr PeAsAnTs
Yeah, deepslate is really slow to mine, I've learned that the hard way by trying to make a castle out of it.... best of luck to you!
The Boatem Medieval Path.
Turn each of the houses into different shops. Then put all the stuff in the Bank at the end.
Name the ally way the wonk walk
Netherrite?
9:29 "TOO STRAIGHT" 💀💀💀🏳️‍🌈

You should make a piston extender door with bricks to clearly resemble Diagon Alley. Maybe with impulse or potato boy
Grain should Sell dimmouds for deapslate

This episode was one of the funniest! You made me laugh so many times it's crazy! Thanks <3
Grian your bace should be called griangonally
Call your base diagon Cavern.

Grian you cold call your allyway the ally of the grian!
name for the alley ; horizont alley or vertic alley
Grian u should name the ally  “grianboat ally”
Everyone is taking advantage of scar
Grian, TNT mining may not seem any faster, but if you blow one tnt per second, you are getting 9 deepslate per second. Considering that this is faster than you can mine, TNT is far more efficient. You can load up on several shulkers in no time, and its a lot more fun.
Bro was 2 blocks away from finding amethyst
Name Suggestion: Tavern's Ally :D
You should cal the ally  Graingotts a mix of Grain/Grain and grinngotts bank

If diagonalley is your inspiration, you could call your alley orthogonalley 🤔😅

Pan would like to congratulate you for reaching 6.9 million subs.

hi
oop
In season 7, mumbo made a basalt farm with tnt, and to make it explode all the time, he realised that if it explodes whilst being pushed by a piston, then it has a 100% chance of breaking, so if anything like that would be great!!!
How about the galley, people will expect a ship but get grians alley instead
Ali way
Here is a name for your alley: Griangonealley
CALL YOUR BASE DIAGRIAN ALLEY!

C’mon, why not the gralleyway?
please name it griagon ally
you could name it Opal Ally, after one of your cats and have a little momento to your cats hidden somewhere in the ally.
The grate alley is a GRATE name for the alley (the entrance could be a grate)
How about the "Alleywonk" in reference to 9:36-9:44 where the whole alleyway was supposed to be "wonky"?
Grian you can flow water trough the middle of the street, like a litle channal.
Sigh. Scar always seems to get himself into a pickle. And half the time it’s either Grian’s fault, or its Grian’s fault and he ends up at the prickly side as well.
Name suggestion: the G.Allyway / the Galliway
20:40  Scar: 400 diamonds Grian be like: you had my curiosity but now you got my atention
how about Pesky alley
diagon alley as it kind of looks like it.
He should title it.. "I defeated 1.18 cave generation!!"
What if Scar just built a MASSIVE wagon?
Grian: its barely faster than before Me: what if u use netherite instead of diamond?       also P is for PESKY BIRD
Is 3rd life coming back? I can't wait for it to begin again lol

If you use many colours, call it Dye-A-Gon Alley

Was that Ollivanders I saw? 🤔🤔🤔 Are you building Diagon Alley?!
Grain do the map thing you did in season 7. Keep track of the development.
You should call your Alley "Gally" for Grian's Alley :) Big fan dude, absolutely love watching your videos <3
the boatum hole is the best thing the hermits have ever done =)
Name the ally ' Cavern ally'.
im just watching the video, minding my own business (in full screen on my laptop) when all of a sudden "HEY WANNA BUY OUR ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE?!?!?" just APPEARS. i love it when im trying to watch youtube and i get a face full of antivirus software pop ups :D

GRIAN GRIAN I FOUND A NAME!!! The GRIAGON ALLEY
Why isn’t cub joining the boatem? He’s really close
I think that the alley should be called the leaning alley
Alleywave. Not me finding this funny at 7 am.
Boatom hole is a money scheme for grian
Call your alley = Griagon valley or alley
Name it diagon alley and make broom shops and book shops and stuff. You could also make a gringotts and a secret entrance
15:04 Is he breaking bedrock???
do you plan on uploading the mcc stream?
I always thought it would be cool to have a mod for the void where one of the effects was you could build a special void chest and whenever anything anywhere fell into the void it would show up in the chest.  The chest would be expensive to make though.  You'd have to put an ender chest into your crafting grid, but when you clicked it it would open.  Then you would have to fill each slot in the chest with wither stars and the dragon egg (the dragon egg wouldn't be consumed but only 1 void chest could exist at once, so you'd want to keep the dragon egg safe so someone else couldn't make a new void chest to replace yours.  The void chest would have 54 slots and you could take items out of it with a hopper.
Hay grian. Good video, you have a lovely building style. (:
Let Scar build by Impulse's base to include him more in the gigabase, please!
This server is so weird
I propose the name Diagonal Alley.
JUST COMPLETE THE BUILD HALF MORE to make the gigerbase
16:28 ._.
WHERE IS TFC my man
call the allwyway the gallyway for grians ally
Griangonally
Could you please please livestream yourself creating Scar’s boxes? Im guessing all of them will take a while, so maybe just 1 or 2? We would love to see the process of building one :)
G:steals stuff G: it's lag MJ:agrees
nice build
The best way to get deepslate is to mine in those huge caves
Idea for the name of the alley.       1. Diagrian alley
suggestion: you should make a building based off of the Weasly's Wizards Wheezes if you can
Put alleyways between some houses that lead to elegal and dark places
grian mining deepslate: ‘it’s so slow’ me with an u enchanted iron pickaxe: 👁👄👁
6.9 million subscribers
The G-cave
Wonk Ally
Get it ?
I knew number 13 is cursed
Apologies if these names have been suggested already.   Right Up Your Alley Griagon Alley
Grian should name the alley way  "griagonalley"
Day #2 for my ally way suggestion: My suggestion for the ally way is to make a type of market w/ villagers and goods etc. have the villagers be ‘clerks’ (mainly just there for show) and line the streets w/ shops. You can even start a renting thingie, where people can rent one of the stands/buildings for storage etc.
Call the alley Diagon Alley
Grian has 6.9 Mill subs nice!
The name of the base should be grian Hallows
Hehe waffle town
Hey grian, dont know if you remember me but i got sick again and just bingewatching hermit craft, buildbattles, and everything else fills a hole in my heart
you should build a house out of diamond blocks
I watched the message that said these 2 fell out of the world in bdubs stream and just thought “hmm I wonder what they could be doing”… now we know 😂
Hey everyone grian has 6.9 million subscribers   NOICE
The alley name: Backway Boatem
you  can put your villagers in your houses like little shops
Make a rode
Grian, call it Orthogon Alley.
Bet someone's already suggested this but what about just naming the alley Dragon Alley? It's really close to the Diagon Alley name and you do have the dragon egg after all.
I think the ally should be called boatem boulevard
Scar plans on making a sky city so you'd still need to finish the back of the mountain 😂😂😂
Vertic Alley cuz puns
The deal is now a blood packed and scar has to build there
new
At this point you should just name the alleyway 'Wonk Alley'
It's weird that Grian and Mumbo's stuff are lagging into each other's inventory
Griagon Alley
Just got a good name for the alley: Diagrain Alley. Please name it that
I shall let you know that we are FLYING in the diamond department. Grian is always the richest hermit.
3:40 the hermitcraft version of mining off camera
He should name the alleyway the galley
Hole on
You should definitely call the ally the "g"ally
Life always gives a wonk
What about the tilting valley?
who needs a cliff update when we have hermitcraft
At what point do you just turn keep inventory on for the server?
The "Scar build HERE!!" sign reminds me of those error messages in Garry's Mod when you try loading in an item without the correct mod installed.
You should call the alley the gralley
Grian has 6.9M subscribers at the time this comment was posted. Nice :D
at least you didn't die with the deepslate!!
You want to build a bank at the end of the alley...Griangotts perhaps?
I vote you name the alley "Griagon Alley"
Mojang:We’ll be adding new huge giant cliffs coming in a couple months.  Botem members:Right now?
Griagon alley
20:12 that "hello"
Grian you should call it Diamond Alley !!!!
just more sacrifices for the boatem. its ever-growing...
You should make the deepslate building in the ally to have soul flame lanterns rather than normal ones
Mumbo has no iron dont take it
Base name: The Galley. G-Alley. Grian Alley.
All those doors in season 7 lagged into shulker boxes
16:42  You do bad stuff and bad stuff happens to you. - Karma  (because 16:04)
"For the diamonds!" Famous last words
Grian if you are still looking for an name for the ally I think you should call it that Gally
name it Griagon alley
Grian:*makes building* also Grian:so when do i use the buidlings i built us:thats the funny part, you dont.
6.9 M                           nice
You should add a mod that makes your eyes huge when you zoom in
Netherite pickaxes should be able to instamine deepslate just saying
The alley shall be the galley
I love that grian is evil. He's my favorite hermit because he starts the games and wars that I'm not able to. Also he's a frickin boss, powerful red boi of shenanigans. All of the most memorable moments come from him.
A train station sounds good for botem incorporation
Hermitcraft 8 for botem crew is like a "pseudo 3rd life" series
grain do a 1.17 tips u did it for other updates y not 1.17
Fun fact:the ally way is got started building in episode 7 and now its episode 13 its still not finished
THE HAT!!!
you should call the ally di-egg-on ally
Can u name the alley crime alley because thats the name of rhe alley batmans parents became livent
Huh, my finger just lagged onto the like button, weird
So since it’s modeled after Diagon alley and the real one which I cannot remember its name but how about Diagrian Alley
You should name the alleyway dia-grain alley (yes grain not Grian)
13:56 this is not the lion king
I think scars starter base is bigger than grians “mega” base.
you should make the big building at the back the "bank" where you store your valuables
You should name it Galley Grain lol
What if the name for the ally is the g'ally
16:37 RIP
grian copper oxidizes faster when the blocks are more spread apart
Add a building that looks like the barge
For a name for the alley what about griagon alley
Name the alleyway: “the burrow”
So the bank has to be called Griangotts…. Right?
Hey Grian. Something to considder: Diagon Ally IS a pun. It's a fairly obvious pun too. So if Diagon Ally is a pun the name of your base needs to be a pun too SUPER IMPORTANT UPDATE: You are building PARTOL ALLY Becauae your ally is only PART of the Giga base
Is Timmy the pig ok ?
GROIN pls name it "the galley".
“If I don’t get something done before this is done oxidation, the server will fall into apocalypse” Foreshadowing, I can already sense it.
The building that you're gonna build in the middle should be called Griangots
“ I need to activate my 2 brain cells and remember how to spell. “
Grian breaks the blocks under scar Grian: it was lag XD
How about The Subterranean Streetway for a name?
Imagine hermit craft with cannons grian would be no were near here
Name suggestion for the alley:   Diamond Alley
The name could be Gria-gon alley
Grien if u wana make greengots at the middle of ur base and its all about trains so u and mumbo can make bunkers underground which is traveled via minecarts and u can use hight levels with minecarts mumbo is good with that too
16:36: death
You should make a gringotts at the end of your tunnel and make the desks that the goblins are seated at where you put your villagers you should use gringotts as a trading hall
Wagon to barge to train, what next, Plane?
You’re gonna give poor scar a heart attack someday
Petition for Grian to call the alleyway the G-alley. It's a pun for season 8.
It should be a town hall
I believe that the alley should be called “DiGrian Alley”
Grian a name for the allyway can be dallyway
Grian: Barge eat you heart out The Barge:   ;-;
Scar is like grian’s uncontrollable child
DYDA Alley Did You DieAgain Alley
Grian should have just let him fall
New Building Term: Wonk
Can we get lore n stuff like the mycelium wars n stuff pls i need to draw  a n g s t  stuff
Grains alley (old what to call it)
You should name the alley way: The G cave, just to keep the theme of the g train
Name it the gally
Is this going to end up being called “Wonky Alley”
Horizont Alley!
How did grian fall in the hole as well, silly billy
Vertic Alley
How does Grian manage to be in constant debt to Scar due to pranks
🧔🏿‍♀️
Name the ally digrin ally (die-grin) just in case you can’t read it
Dagrian alley
The smallest house in the world would be a cool addition to the alleyway
*WONK*
The Wonk AlleyWay….I’m gonna just leave this here 😊
Call it Gilligan's ally!
Name it the g town
You could name the alley “Stalagmite alley”
Grian trying to prank Scar, Dies himself trying to save him :/  The void is the best player in the game now
Cavernari Alley
Shouldn't the ally open up to the back so it works like a street?
Does anyone else feel like grian isn't very motivated this season? I mean, he's been sort of messing around every episode, not making farms, getting netherite. He's stalling. This isn't a bad thing, he's not required to grind but he usually does and this season he's not. This isn't just me right?
Bro what if he named the alley Hermiton Alley
Wow has 6.9 million subs
“I took a zig where I shoulda zagged” I’m going to use that from now on. Thanks Scar 😂😂😂
Grian's Train Should Be Called The GALOR (Grian's Armada, Lots Of Randoms -random things-)
you should name the alleyway the wonkyway
IDEA FOR ALLEY NAME: Groatem Alleyway (Grain+Boatem) :)) I Hope you like it
Griangon Alley
the Gally way
Grian you should use your Work time laps song from season 7
Griangon alley
please make gringots at the end
Get some netherite
I paused multiplayer to watch Grian.
You could make the big thing at the bottom a restaurant.
OMG when grian fell back into the hole
You should name the alia automation alie
Make a quarry
just an idea for a name... Diamondsgone Alley
Grain sould call the cave “The grave cave” or “The gave cave”
i bet this has been suggested before but you should call your ally "Diagrain Alley"
The galley
So does that mean that mumbo gets to keep the beacon, I think that's a great deal in Mumbo's favor.
Scars will base has lag next to Grians base
L
Bring scar a llama and say remember pizza
The beatem hole seems to be a really big work hazard, it feels like someone dies in it every episode.
what te fhyuckj
Grian isn’t just a builder, he is a *god*  Edit: e
D
name the ally the "wonky wALLY
Might as well give up on calling it a giga base... it is just a cluster of unrelated bases even if they are connected.  Seriously??? Resorting to blackmail to get someone to build YOUR base??? pathetic.  Yeah... you DESERVED to loose all your stuff.
What about the allygrain
Delridge alley
BoatemAlly???
Wonk alleyway
What you have 2 brains cells 🤯 I had 1 but  we do talk about him
Hey Grian, which house are you actually going to live in in your alleyway? I was wondering as there are going to be a lot of buildings and maybe the middle one at the end would be good.
Im confused, I watch other Hermits videos, and I have seen this message in the backround for a week or two, but... in this video.. its up to date around you
grian for the right side you could make the train go into the build
Allie Alley
The Greg on Ali
The aloe Vera way and sell slime
Grian Should Call It The Gally. For G-Ally
Obviously the alley should end with a bank. Grian-gots?
It should be called down town ally , instead of down town Abby 😂
You should make 1 house out of diamonds
I think in 1.18 Minecraft should make deepslate somewhat farmable. They would do this by doing something similar to the copper block. Stone blocks placed below a certain y-level will change into deepslate after some amount of time of being loaded. They could also apply this mechanic to ore blocks, which would allow deepslate emerald ore to be attainable in survival Minecraft after they change ore generation ranges.
you should name it the galley (G-alley)
grian being over controlling
Grian: Send a message to... Hermitcraft 7: MUMBO?! Grian: ...Scar
Fill the ally with cats and call it the “Cat Attack”
grian: *has lots of diamonds* boatem hole: i know how to level this out
Name the alley the Grian station
I have a suggestion for what you could name the alley way. Maybe you could name it Galley like alley but with a G cause Grian starts with a  G.
Galley cavern
If you still want an idea for what to put in the front left warped building, seeing as it’s nearing October, you could put a bunch of pumpkin and jack-o-lantern skeles, zombies, and zombie piglins in there. They only spawn during Halloween, so it would be a flex. and a half since it’s very likely season 8 will end before next Halloween, plus you have two months to plan on how to wrangle them. I’m not sure if strays, drowned, and husks spawn with them on, but if they do, having one of each would be awesome. (Drowned would need to be separate from the others since they need to be in water)
Congratulations on 7
Do the griagon alley bc there are so many puns this season
Wouldn’t a good name for The alleyway could be named boattom alley.
Poultry man
Just a suggestion but what about calling the alley: Griagon Alley?
grian: saved scar, killed scar, killed grian
You should name the base: Grians Gorge Gulley Gallary alley
Diagon Alley
3rd day of needing floatem pole
19:00 this keeps happening. You might as well make eight or ten more sets while you're at it.
Deepslate ores look really good, especially with the new textures, so you should silk those too.
I like ‘The Grumbles’ as a mix up of Grian and the shambles …. Sort of.
6.9 million subs I like it!
DiaGrian Alley
Name idea: backless ally
Petition for grian to call it Downton Alley
18:10 oH nouhe
You should name the bank at the end GrainGotts once you build it
“Just had to add- A bit a’ woenk”
Have you seen how much deepslate impulse has used? How many hours did he take? He hasn't said a word about it as far as i know.

Griagon Alley
Grian building really hard buildings, Me vibing to the background music
Grian : "the alley. ive just given up at this point thinking of names'  Me : Alley 'o' G's . . . it's right there
grian: "my two brain sells" mumbo jumbo: "my two brain sells" mumbo and jumbo are same person more proof grain: you  know i don't think I'm allowed to make  jokes about the back of bases jokes about the back of bases  I've I've designed this specific base so  i don't have to build the back of  anything.
try to get impulse to make a blast chamber district, blocks that are blown up precisely while in motion have a blast resistance of 0
you should name your base the Wonky Walkway
Grian should totally cover the cave to give it a dark, night feel but illuminate just the buildings, and have a waterfall at the end of the cave, filled with mossblocks. and vines, like an old temple or fountain, maybe like a park.
How about the galley for the name of the alley ? I know it means the kitchen of an airline or ship but it just has a ring to it
We should call it the Grainy Alley
Grain- I Think you should build "your house" or like the main building at the end
grinnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!
What if you built gringrots the wizardly bank under the mountain? i feel like fantasy is a style that could really pop Grian!
Not just ur gang

Grian: "were slowly making our decent to-"  Me: "madness?"  Grian: "the center-"

Grian, You should call it BLOCKturn alley
You can call it the Hermit Alleyway!!!
diagon alley? no. diagrian alley
By the time the copper oxidizes you should build the base at the end of the alley
Diagrian Alleyway would be a good name
The Grambles...
Grian I suggest putting in Sherlock grains shop from season six, it would fit in
Caboose caverns for the alley way
I wonder if the Boatem team ever wonders if the Boatem hole isn’t worth it.  🧐 Like how many times have people’s lives been sacrificed and their stuff was taken. 😂 I’m thinking that maybe this Boatem hole is sentient and it’s keeping a kill count.
Grians new motto is "For the Diamonds".
Name the alley dilly dally alley it’s the name of a ski run at my local mountain
Call it the alleyway of fun (cause of fun color buildings)
Grain: * Mines the Deepslate * Me: Wow that’s fast Grain: 5:13  Me: That’s slow, never going to get done, not worth it.
Since we are doing puns and your inspiration - Diagrian Alley seems apropos possibly
The ally should be called diagon ally (hp reference)

the galleyway
Could you build a gringolds inspired bank at the end please?
How about you ask Mumbo to build you some kind of world eater for the deepslate? It'll take forever, sure, but at least you get deepslate.
Name the bank griangots and name the ally diagrian ally
How about Horizont Alley or Vertic Alley? You know, as a play of words on Diagon Alley? I mean, you literally used Ollivanders as a reference pic for one of the buildings.
Grian if you are reading this plz make a new 3rd life the first one was great 👍
huh, my comment lagged onto this string of other comments
What about calling the alleyway dragonalley bedause you own the dragon egg?
As a meme you should add the half mansion from last season in the alley. That would be hilarious 😂

SIX SHULKERS OF DEEPALATE??? THAT IS ALOT
"2 hours got me only 6 boxes of deepslate"  ONLY 6?
Mildly disappointed that no one is talking about what pearlescentmoons message to scar looks like ?
deepslate avenue
I think you should name it alley
Water bucket would've helped
I'm finally better at building in Minecraft
getting all that stuff back must've put a tri-DENT in your resources...
Deepslate mining isn't as bad as forging in hypixel skyblock
You should name the ally way cave away
I did a rough test of haste ii vs TnT for deepslate. In five minutes I mined out 7 stacks vs blown up 26 stacks. TnT beats hand mining. Only thing you have to be careful of is placement (wide area is best to get as much coverage as possible) and among deepslate/away from regular stone.  This method will only get more powerful in the mostly deepslate deep dark biomes.
Grian misspelled definitely lol
Call it the "Griagon Alley"
Let Luke Davidson games go join hermit craft 😀😀
I feel like grians main goal on hermitcraft is to get the most diamonds and flex. Just never spend em.
I’m not the only one who realized HE HAS 6.9M SUBS
DIA-MOND ALLEY!! That's what you should name it!
Mannn just watch third life and wow

selling deepslate is kind of a terrible idea, you should just keep it for yourself.
Tbh I know how annoying it is to get deep slate bc I made a base that required tons of deep slate and it took forever to get some when u got a plain diamond pickaxe
Grian you should call it cynic-alley and make it very evil
Minecon ally  Kindov hail marry but iunno
Griagon alley?
Normal player when they lose stuff: Cry,rage,monitor non existent,screamm Hermitcraft player: Laugh......menacingly

Should call the alley way rock road

Raise price 'till no one buys anymore. It's how I'd reduce workload. On the deepslate I mean.

Instead of diagon alley call it diagonal alley
The alley way should be the Galley way.
Oh Grian so you know where the deepslate is right? You can use that carriage for exclusive deals, and stuff you may not get again like deepslate. So basically a one time offer place?
name for the alley "Diagon Alley"
You should put copper in every timelaps wich will show how much  time has passed that would be cool.
Grian has 6.9 Mil subs nice

And why not make a hot air balloon  building next to mumbos base and take down your wall that is closest to mumbo and turn that area into a place where the hot air balloons take off and every boatem member can build a hot air balloon of their own liking over the bases and even maybe boatem
The boatem road?
Week 3 of asking for you to name it Griagon Alley
Is this just another version of it was just a prank
farmaly can be name for ally way
Griangon alley
Suggestion for the ally's name, Amethyst Ally:  Personally I think the name has plenty of potential, including the fact that Amethyst is now a block in the game, in the real world Amethyst is a fairly common gemstone, but finding it can still be amazing and special, especially if you didn't buy it at a store!   Due to the gemstones common nature many people don't tend to think much about it, but people who tend to appreciate gems and things more can find Amethyst to be very pretty and alluring, so I think it fits the ally because at a first glance people might not see the Ally as anything to gawk at (No offence Grian, I think the build looks great so far!) but when it's finished and people can go in and actually get the whole perspective of the crowded space with too many buildings, I feel like it'll look amazing!
Lol you can call it wonky road😂😂
Griagon Alley?
Digalong Alley
the fact that against all logic grian jumped into that hole after scar with no hesitation was *chef's kiss* friendship
If it's based on Diagon alley, I'm still going to call it Wobb Alley, or Wonk Alley
Alley name idea = diagrian alley
Name for the ally "Gigally"
An idea for an alleyway name: The Griagon Alley
Last 2 seasons Grian stole everything from mumbo now mumbo is stealing from grian
Boatem way is perfect though
Instant Karma's gonna getcha, right in the face
NAME THE ALLEY WAY THE MIDNIGHT CAVNERN
Scar truly is the poorest little meow meow of the server.
Grains Mafia boss moment, laughing over a helpless scar made my day 😂
DiaGrainAlley
You should make the center a town hall, kinda like season 7 lol.
Grian you have to call the alleyway puny lane!
Grian serious talk now: Please please pleeeaaase make the big building at the back of the ally based on Gringots. 🙏🙏🙏Loving the vids so far. Woo season 8! The punniest season of all time
Alley name: Griagon Alley
Diagon alley? More like DiaGrian Alley
DiaGrian Alley
Diagrian alley
"It's lag" *Proceeds to rob Mumbo blind*  also did anyone else get Lion King flashbacks when scar kicked Grian into the abyss?
I have a axe named axey and a pick named silkie
Name the alley Dia-grian Alley!
Horizont alley
When I saw the end of Grians deepslate mining, I realised that the world’s cave generation isn’t random, it’s just Grian mining deepslate
I would like to resubmit the Alley name of: Orissant Alley  It meets all specifications including not being Diagon Alley.
Call the alleyway "Girangon alley" as a refrense to Diagon alley.
Name for the Alley, The "G-alley" has a decent ring to it ya think?
He missed out on calling the alley the griagon alley
Grian thank you so much for making your videos they have helped me through some tough times since my mom passed oway i have been thinking of suicide but your videos helped me overcome the urge.  I love you for ur videos thank you for your good work.
The alleyway is going down in a diagnoal way so why not call it Diagnoal alley? (Thats another pun)
you can call the allyway "the grallyway"
Bad times with scar
GRIANgots diaGRIANalley
ytet again
Scar: uwu step grian, i am stuck Scar after a minute:wha- step grian, what're you doin?!
Why does Grains timelapse music sound like it's pulled straight from sims?!?
OH MY GOD GRIAN!!! please please plEaSE!!!- make the building at the end of the alleyway a bank to store all your diamonds in and AND PLEASE freaking make it look like gringots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   just please :) please I have had the idea since you told us that you wanted to make an alleyway and I think it would look AMAZING pleeeeEEEeeeeEEeeeeeeEEEEEase :) :) like if u agree pls
Name suggestion: The Deep Ally
it should be called the gralleyway
The trident should've been called "cant believe you made me tri this" lmao but its alright
If you put trees around it you could call it the Grian Grove
The right side of the alley is the new back of the mansion.
Grian finaly learn
why no call the alley way the grainy way
Grian: "I'm not going to make a Mega-Base." Also Grian: "Let's make a Giga-Base!"
Call it the Alley Express
Seeing as this is the season of puns, I think the alley should be called Horizont Alley.
Call it griagon alley
Just keep simple and call it grian alley
How about to call The alleyway G Mountain
Call The alleyway "Grian street"
He has 6 million 900k subs lol the number and really close to 7 million
You could name your base Griagon Valley, just a thought
Has anyone suggested "Diagonal Alley" yet?
Griagone Alley
you can call the ally for: the grally:
Make mumbo build you a giant piston door out of your copper dam. Then it can serve as a permanent entrance to whatever you're going to build there.
23 hour gang
Is King Kong behind the copper dam?
who wrote place your shag here here hahahaa
ohh grian at a sussy number of subs. ''6.9m''. hmmm sus very sus
Sorry, but i'm just going to call it Graindom Alley. You can't change my mind. It just needs some wheat and hay bales and it will be perfect.
if thers isnt a full form of G-train then it shood be griangots train(pun from hogwarts train(:)
The Alleyway really should be called Griagon Alley...
He grian you can separate te coper ro get its faster exedyst
CALL IT ally alleywway
9:57 Mickey mouse
grian: you see, it's really not that much deepslate mined... me: grian, you just made *A WHOLE FREAKING CAVE* WHAT DO YOU MEAN??
14:00 was very strong lion king vibes lmaooo
I think the name of the alley should be the "BuffleBon Alley"
Call the ally the G-ally base
DieAgain Alley
grian.. my name is Ali... can you name the alley way "The Ali Alley" so its like "alley alley"
Scaring scar is always amusing. He has the best reactions!
Alright, this just happened. Grian is on 6.9 million subscribers..... The funny number oh my god! Enjoy it till it lasts.
Hi hi
I don't know why but in this season, Grian's plan not seems clear to me
Man if only everybody was as chill as the Hermits
ONLY six shulker boxes he says
Name this alley Grialley
Grian a netherite pickaxe might be able to insta mine deepslate
Boatem avenue
He should call the ally :The Gally
Why not just call it 'unknown alley'?
If you let me join I'll mine deep slate for you. Totally wont start a union for better wages or anything-
griagon alley
Grian really likes vehicle based shops
Please call the bank griangotts bank
you should try combining hermitcraft and alley or goats and alley or something, for the youre base
"Grian, manipulator of hermits"
...I can't help but think it would have been kinder to leave him stuck in the hole.
Grian you could have built some small English private owner wagons for the deep slate!
you really should name ur base ,,The Grianomally Alley"  Or  the Grianalley
Possible Marketing idea for the G-Train: Set up like some cowboys who are robbing the stage coach which is selling gold or precious gems.
the music you used for the mini time lapse on the buildings was awesome
You could even charge it at 3 diamonds, or even 4 diamonds since it's such a pain to mine
IF YOU MAKE GRINGOTTS ILL LOVE YOU FOREVER
Scars going to need a big space to build out... here I will tell him where to build... thats the fun of minecraft... why don't you tell him what to build as well... lol
You should call it Giga Alley
I kinda like the idea of the Verticalley slowly getting more straight, the further the alley goes on
Grian mumbo lagged out your string:214k8gMb
the hat RIP
karma showed you what for there xD
Hey grian concept name for the alley griagan alley
Sheesh how much lag on one server
Maybe the street could be called the G-Alley-ry?
Grian should name the alleyway the "Boatem Boulevard" XD
Hermiton Alley
Griagon Alley
Haha 6,9 Million subs haha funny number
So when you made the boatem hole I left a comment in that episode saying something like: "You won't think the hole was such a great idea when you loose all your stuff by falling into it. TWICE" The prophecy has been fulfilled.
1:30 how did you get that other stack of stone in your 8th hotbar???
Call the big building at the back griangot
Name the aliy:   Aliway
Dang my finger lagged onto the like button!
If u could do this with just 2 brain cells  I don't know wt will u be capable of if u have all brain cells Love u vids grian😍😍😍
You're missing a comma. It's less of a direction, and more of a statement.
What about G-ally or Gally for your base/ally?
WHY DOES EVERYBODY HAVE ONLY 2 BRAINCELLS I HAVE 3
Name for the alley idea:  Vertic-alley  OR  Horizont-alley
In this episode of HermitCraft : Grian Stonks the G-Train, the regrets it. Grian builds a “wonky building.” Grian meets Scar in a hole. Scar becomes a furry (temporarily). Grian and Scar fricking die. Grian replaces it all.
What if Grian named the alley Griagon Alley, like a spoof of Diagon Alley?
Base name '' The Boatem Boulevard?''
Scar build your “shag” here 🤣🤣🤣
Idea for name: Griangon alley
Hm.. 13th episode.. something unlucky happens.. HMMM
call your base diagrian alley
Adding to the Season of Puns, the bank at the end of the alley should be called Griangotts
I like how they lagged all their items into the void
Think you need a Did you die box vending machine right next to the Boatem hole.
alright hear me out, the Ally should be called Rick Ally, as in reference as Rick Astley
15:05 That badrock was breaking.  🤯 (scar really got a god pickaxe) 😅
Call it the GR-ALLEY please and can I get a shoutout please.
Would you play the sandbox game?NFT
Hey Grian! I loved the video, I wanted to comment over on your channel to let you know your Botem CEO needs some office help. Mumbo made a corner “office” recently but it seems that he might be a little confused as to what an office looks like :/ I thought it would be funny if you upgraded it and used it as leverage to get some exposure or funding from him :) Obviously do what you like with this idea, I don’t know if you’ll see this but keep on making awesome content!!!
Hermits hollow!!
I have a great name for your base wonkyally
Maybe you should hollow out the sides of the Boatem Hole and put small shops in there with a spiral staircase going down. It would be like a mall
"i've been collecting diamonds off camera"
WONKY ALLEY
Grian should be calling galley way instead alley way
shouldve been tridont beleive u made me buy this
GRIAN!! you should call the alley “grigon alley” since it’s modeled after diagon alley and it’s a play on your name!!!
Yeah it would be nice if a Netherite pick insta mined Deepslate with a beacon. Currently it's something like 3-4 swings to mine it with Efficiency 5, two swings to get it with haste 2 and that's the best you get.
you should call the ally diagonal ally
You should make a gtrain station
Build the G.P.O
that yelp at the very end XDDDD i love scar lmfao
Build the GPO
Grian and the creeper
I really enjoy this silly videos... So hilarious 😁.
The G-alley? The Galley?
Hey i got a new name for the g-train and the new name is grain
Horizont Alley
The boatem hole grows hungrier and hungrier every day and requires more loot
at 15:01 the bedrock above scar started breaking
The boatem hole's purpose is to keep Grian from becoming too rich. Every time Grian dies or kills someone in it he has to replace everything xD
i cant say   deserve it
this should be called losing stuff againx10
how about grianally
I have a idea for the ally name what about. Griandon ally?
I was hoping for him to say something like  "the buildings were getting a little too straight so I asked Smajor to help me out"
Griagon Alley
Just an idea for Alley's name Grian + Alley = Galley
DiaGrian Alley
10:40 i was gonna say... like what?
Name the alley: “ The Galley”
Brian should do the diagon alley entrance
7:53 nice crit grian😂
Please name your alleyway "Criss Cross Caverns"!!!!
Grian! Call the bank Grian-Gotts!
At the wnd you should make the Botem HQ
How about you call “The Alley”   “Leaning Alley” because of all the leaning buildings.  I so enjoy these videos! Well done!
I don't know why but I keep thinking of Grian's base as a cul-de-sac
name for the ally way is the crooked walk way
8:21 (ish) what about The Gralley?    Grian + Alley = Gralley? ... :)
You should call it "Vertic Alley" since those buildings are nice and tall, and it's a punny name
Wonky alley
You should build a building With valubele Blocks like Cooper diamond and iron
Boatem pole is probably cursed you should close it 😆😆
*W O N K*
The Alley Of Buildings | i know its a bit weird lol but its all i could think of lol
@Grian what about calling the ally Griansburg?
I like how it was Grian's idea to make the hole and Grian is the one losing the most stuff to it... with Scar at a close second.
I GOT A name !! Grally it's means grians alley
THAY ARE NOT CARIGE STOP CALLING THIM THAT THAY ARE WAGONS I WILL SAY THIS EVERY TIME TILL YOU START CALLING THIM THE RIGHT THANG
For the giant back area of the base, you should build Gringotts Wizarding Bank, 👍
Griangon Alley, yknow you want to name it that
Bless you Grian. You do the stuff that no one ever wants to do
Remember to mine deepslate without silk touch, cant make stairs and stuff with deepslate, only cobbled deepslate
'Wingies' should be 'Flappies,' given all that running about to re-obtain them ... again - lol
the galleyway is a good name (grian + alleyway)
u should call the allyway the 'gralley'
make the gringotts bank at the end
I have an idea for the G-train! Since you're so poor because you keep losing everything, you could build a charity shop. People can donate items to the shop and receive payment, and then other people can buy items that others have donated. (Basically, you make profit off other people's success)
22:30 The best part is this extra clip at the end:')
This might be a silly train of thought, but wouldn’t the diamonds you mine while also mining deepslate also count towards the deepslate profits? And p much guarantee u at least make sometching? Like u gained them on deepslate mining time. Anyways loved the episode! I’m loving digrian alley!
NAME YOUR BASE THE CALLY! (cave+allyway)
10:43 idk, looks like "shag" to me.... and we all know what that means to the Brits.... mhm
@Grian What about: Griagon Alley.
Daigon alley was a pun on Diagonally... So maybe Vertic Alley as a pun on Vertically. Also, you could have a Grian-gotts bank at the end, as suggested down below.
It’s sad that what I call a giga base scar calls a starter base :(
6.9 MiLlIoN SubSCrIBeRS
You should have built it on a diagonal and called it Diagon-alley (die-ag-oh-nal-ee)
Griangotts
I have an idea for the name of the alley: Wonk-E alley
*casually walks past a villager head on the ceilling*
Hey Grian could you mabye tell us where you get your music because I would love to listen  to it
"maybe a council or something at the back" maybe a senate so you can say the senate will decide your fate.
Call it griagon alley 😄😁
U can make ur own under ground builds farming deep slate and nothing else than deep slate and ores will make a cool lookin under ground cave u can use
allyway name sugestion diamond alley
I’ve come up with a name for the Alley now it’s kinda a copy of Diagon Alley but now presenting “Diagrian Alley
GRIAN-gotts bank instead of grinngotts bank
Griagon Alley is making its way to completion lol
I mined two double chests of granite with my stone tools?!😂😂💩
You should make a special Boatem Bite it Box for the boatem deaths x)
Instead of making a bank at the end of the alleyway, make it as a diagon alley, with a brick wall opening with some button combinations, and inside it will be the magical world
11:40 why can i hear mumbo say weird🤣🤣
Whoah I just had a really really random idea... Some people use miniblocks to lable chests, and heads would work pretty much the same, except for being the wrong textures (you're seeing the idea?), but you can easily work around that by changing your Skin a bit, right? So if there are no miniblocks of something very specific you need to lable a chest, could you just draw the needed block on the head of your skin, get killed so you get the head/fake miniblock and change back?
how about the boatllyway for the base
So Mumbo isn't the only person with 2 brain cells...
Welcome to the Galley
You should post more bloops like that at the en of most vifeosn
Grian is too nice, probably could've even priced the deepslate as 1 stack for 3 diamonds and people would've bought it easily. xD. Though in the end shops are meant to help not extort so it's fun to watch <3
I saw you s7 base in vr, its beautiful
I really hope that one of the alley way houses is gonna be the barge
What if Grian calls the ally way boatem ally
i think you need netherite pickaxe to insta mine deepslate try it out
6,9m subs, nice.
Diggin alley
'Griangotts'
a name for the alleyway mountains alley
idk if its allowed on hermitcraft, but u could use auto-mining scripts to collect deepslate
Oh deer
please call it the diagrian alley I'm begging u
Gria-Gon Alley!
Alley name idea: Diagrain alley, yes it is meant to be grain
havent watched this season yet but thats what is considered a starter base these days?! ive never even had a base remotely that cool
Awful lot done? By that... You mean awful lot to get you back where you were 😉
It should be called the Gally way!
I think that "oi" is the most Australian thing that someone can say.
If you make a dye shop in your alley name the dye shop dye-a-grian alley
10:59 one day just one day I was really really really really sad
Hey grian why don't you call the ally "The wonky ally" or the "wonkey wanky ally"
Deepslate pricing doesn’t need a bulk deal - people will pay because they know it’s a pain! Don’t feel guilty - make sure it’s worth your grind.
"sending scar a message"   SEASON 7 FLASHBACKS INTENSIFIES
karma got you grian for what you did to scar lmao
"oops"
ur stuff lagged into the void
Grally is an option😂😂
What about the alleyway being called giga-grian alley?
Mumbo: This is totally my beacon and emeralds. Grian: (confused villager noise)
I think a good name for the alleyway is alleygrain
Name you’re base cavyway
Congrats for 6,9 mil subs
Grian, you could call the Alleyway: The Boat'em Alleyway! Or the Griagon Alley, or the Alley mt., Alley Cavern. Something like one of those I guess.
i think yiu shiuld sprrad tge alley to mumbi and pearls base
name the base the g street
Not-Parallel Alley
6.9 million subscribers ;D
Grian, I just want you to know the laughs we got from this were worth the 5 hours.
7:57 😂🥶😂
Name it Thalley, The alley
Grian, is you want your copper to oxidize faster they need to be far away from each other!
The G-Ally seems like a fun name for the ally
grian i have an idea maybe make builds inspired by all hermit craftshops
Grian's Power Status: Started Season 6 civil war, Killed dream, Won the season 7 turf war, The Button Thanos and winner of 3rd life season one (Looking forward to season 2!)
Hey, Grant? Got wonk?
For egg puns Dieggon Alley is still available bw
Call your base diagonal alley
S7: grian builds the Barge  S8: grian builds the G-train me who knows grian will build a airship next season  grian: hippity hoppity your ideas are now my property.
Grian should make himself a copper clock
Hey grian, I really just like the name “the alley”. simple and catchy to the ears
How about the galley way
You should build a bank at the end of the alley and call it Grian-gots bank.
Looks like Grians version of Petra, Jordan.
Instead of Diagon Alley, call it Horizont Alley or Vertic Alley (maybe add Griangotts bank at the end of the alleyway too)
You could call the alley ane alley lol
Trialley(way) Triangle + alleyway A small name idea for the alleyway
The Boatem Hole demands blood, and diamonds.
19::44 AYOOOOOO U KINDA SUS
Jupapi menyeno
Griagon Alley
19:45 did i just hear booties
GRIAN!!!! Seeing as the alleyway is inspired by Diagon Alley, you should name the alleyway “Griagon Alley”!!
Gallyway
I’m dropping you rockets  Drops all the rockets trapping himself
Since scar is going to build in your spot don’t know particularly where if you have a election again for mayor you could be scars campaign manager of the server I mean do you have mambo for Boteom
You should build the gringots bank at the end of the ally way, or possibly something similar
" The ally of the Diamond King"
I have to use a stone picaxe to mine deepslate
Call the alley grian is gonally
LMAOOOOO LAGGGG
The bank should be called Griangotts
Maybe too simple, but: Grian + Alley= Galley?😅
grian at the back of the alleyway you should add a villager trading market where you put all your villagers in little stands each stand has a diffrent type of villager blacksmith farmer ect.... it will be like sort of like a farmers market
Die for allay
NOoooo the Hat!!!! RIP
Nobody talking about how mumbo gets stuff from "lag"
7:50 ... poor creeper, just daydreaming about having some stuff
Name suggestion for the alley: Moungig Alley, Mountain and Giga together
Cal the alley The G-Alley OR the Galley
Dia ‘G’ alley?
Grian and scar should make a group called red jackets
or alley valley
Sadly , 6 shulkers of deepslate I would get only 9 stacks , let alone mine for 2 hours!
NAME IT VALLEY ALLEY!!!
Hermitcraft seson 8, the seson where grian make all those boxes
The Gally
if you want you can try and get a villager for every toll and armor whit the basics enchants that you always won't so when you later make a box it will go much faster
Will u guys PLEASE stop playing with the Boatemhole!!! PLEASE! My anxiety goes up Everytime u fall in it Also, when u die in the void, doesn't ur stuff spawn at the top of the nether?
At first I didn’t think that the alleyway would come together, but I think that it is looking really nice!
Every time someone dies in a boatem hole, they become void of items…
15:06 ummm did anyone see!?! scar made a crack in the bedrock!!!
this deepslate mining feels like what a team is for; if you share the work with other members of boatem, you could keep the deepslate stocked more consistently and go a long way toward making boatem THE place to shop
Name it spectral crescent
You guys should seriously seal up that hole at the admin level by replacing the bedrock. I have no idea why anyone would ever open a hole in bedrock at the bottom of the overworld.
sooooo close to 7mil
Oh, look at the lag on the server XD
The alleyway should be named “Goatem Alley
well no, you got 2 stacks of diamonds *and all the diamonds from the deepslate sales* . so no, "just mining for diamonds' wouldn't be better, because you'd *only* get the 2 stacks of diamonds
it would be nice if you sell blackstone and bassalt with the deepslate, so they match themes and are easier to get. :D
well it isn't a diagonal ally.  So what about Horizont-ally.
What’s the name of the alley!!!!!!
F
He should name it daigon alley
Grian and scar pranks are the best! And then give them the mumbo jumbo and it will be more chaotic, and then later on grian will be slowly adding ImpusleSV and Grian just started a war and we didn't evev realize because of the lag LOL
6.9Million nice
Not fun anymore
9:38 If they're to straight, they just need more rainbow!🌈🧑♥️🧑
Im starting to hate you nerd thats not cool
Your so immature to do that to scar grian
Since Diagon Alley was a play on diagonally, you could call it Vertic Alley? (Inspired by Misfits and Magic)
Get a gold pickaxe dummy
21:26 Foreshadowing!
Grains grove should be the alleyways name
Call the alley, "Wonky Walk Alley" Just a thought, you said its supposed to be all wonky :)
If anyone knows the name of the music at 19:06, please tell me.
How do you download season 7?
Grian you should have called scars trident  Tri-dent in my finances 😂😂😂😂😂
name the ally "gally"
Wonk
Can you make stories in hermitcraft
Yo name the alleyway Wonkalley or The Wonkalley
What about G-allye
Double quadruple quintuple karma
Eyy grian build a bank it’ll look really coool and and you can also put all your diamonds in it
14:34 I love that we have no idea the backstory behind the cat head. Like, where did it come from? Did Grian put the curse of binding on it the first time? "Doesn't that have curse of binding?" "No, no- Dang it... You put it back on??"
Grian you are the  best mc youtuber , your videos are like your content,love your builds and videos
The big bank that Grian will build should be ‘Griangots’ and he should bring back the dragon from Season 6.
Wait... did Scar make an order for 4 of those boxes with or without a trident in them...?
Should call the alley “Grian’s Ginnel”
Call the ally diagrian ally
Why is the title me every time I play survival
This will keep happening until the proper sacrifice is offered.
griagon alley
Name the alley “The Grain Alley”
You should call the alley “The Alley of Wonk”
about that with mumbo steling your beacon and he said that he had maid one himslef but he cant cus he cant kill anything
I think you should make it soo that when is night the big building should glow blue or some really cool colour like a neon colour🥺 and plsss can you say something about my comment on your next vid 🤪😁!?!..
Scar wants to build a floating castle thing... Dunno how your plan is going to work.
call it the "Grally way"
"apart from breaking my neck" 😂😂🤣😂😂
lol
Name Ideas for future shops: The Plane, The Car, The Cart, The Bike, The Bycicle.
Here’s a name for the alley pumpkinseed street (get it instead of Sesame Street;)
Well that was unexpected
Name the alley: Horizont alley, or Vertic alley
The GrAlley
The dislikes are all from Mumbo’s copper
*16:45** well, shlt happens*
I have idea for alley the brick stone alley
Grian: i can leave you here and nobody will ever find you.  Scar: * uses chat *  Grian: That isn't how are you supposed to play this.
Is it just me or has Grian And Mumbo got even more entertaining
You should build Gringotts bank at the end of the ally
You have hard werk from mega base ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ
scars shag pad, 10.44
It should be called the giagon alley
I still think you 4 should build an ice boat race course (end-to-end, not a loop) to emphasise the BOAT in Boatem.
The Boatem hole has eaten so many hermits I feel like there should be monuments for every body who has been sacrificed
I have a name for the ally how about griagon ally? Just a thought sounds good to me
U should have a bank at the end of the alley and call it griangotts
Scar and grain falling in the hole me: suicide squad
nice
G-Train or for short Grain
Maybe call it Litter Alley Since it's both a pun of Literally and the alley would be crowded with people and crowds leave behind litter
You should get that lag fixed out in case you lag out and accidentally make an end crystal and blow up scar . That would be a shame
What music do you use for the timelapses? Please i need answers
You could name the alley " Diagrian Alley"
watching them fall in the void at 0.25 speed is halarious
at this point just tell everyone their gonna lose stuff
8
LOL! that clip at the end
Time to build a tnt duping flying machine to mine that deepslate.
Average Grian episode -steal someone's possession -make an offer he can't refuse -kill your friend -make a huge business deal -goodbyeee
Sell smoe houses for diamond in allyway
9:29 pov god making me
For your alley why don't you name it G - alle - on as in G stand for grian and then alle is for alley after that added on and you would get "Galleon" which is a a type of ship and it fits with the boatem village.
He really took 3rd on trending from technoblade getting cancer
Abnorm'alley!!! no? okay :/
2% of the time on hermitcraft is building stuff, 98% of it is spent replacing scar's stuff
Why
oh no
bdubs already has deepslate store
Scar died just like what happened in 3rd life, here lies scar " it was just a prank"
maybe the alley can be called Cave'alley Way
An idea for the name of your mega base is: `Diaogrian Aley`  i love your videos and am a big fan, keep up the good work!
The alleyway could be called the unamed
Wonk
Since the name for the train is the "G-train", the alley could be called "the Alley G". :D
Dope! They are getting an Olivander's style building
What about “GAlleyway”
Please build a bank and call it "Grian-gotts"
now the hermits have both made new mountains AND new caves. mojang will be out of a job soon XD
Call it Griagon ally
I think u should call the alleyway boatemway.
"WAIT, I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ROCKETS"  Famous last words
The Barge Is the definition of nothing to something
Episode 3 of me asking Grian to build a bank called Griangots  Edit: GRIAGON ALLEY
Grian+Alley=galley. Perfect
How about The Gallery ?? G -- Grian  Alle -- Alley Gallery -- for the beautiful, creative architecture looking like a colleague of different art styles
CAVERN-U
15:08 he was breaking the bedrock
They need to put a door over the boatemhole
Watching your videos is a delightful happy experience for me  They are always hilarious (especially the  encounters with scar)
Why didnt anyone realized grian hit  6,9 mil subs
grain.
how many inventories has the boatem hole claimed?
Copper dam runs out = hermitcraft season 8 civil war???
Grian should name the bank griangrots
It's just episode  13 and Grian has over 64 DIAMOND BLOCKS
you should call the alley 'griagon alley'
Tri... can'5 believe you made me buy this xD
You should of called it a tri - dent in your wallet...       Ok  ok calm down I was just *tri*-ing to make a pun
Make a bank at the end of the alley called “Griangotts”!!!!!
It would’ve been so legendary if Grian’s redstone somehow in that moment worked and it saved him from dying in the void
We need to Keep a tally of how many diamonds and netherite is lost to the hole.... The person at the end of the season with the most diamonds and netherite lost should get a prize in the next season Possible be the first person to have the Tegg / tag or even something else?
What about calling the ally “Griagon” ally rhyming with the inspiration “Diagon ally”
Try to make gringotts as the bank and then you can exchange diamonds on loan to the other hermits and put profitable and safe money
3:50 he does everything for diamonds😂
wow...the smoothness of that exit through 1 missing pane of glass at 21:00
Grian’s laugh in 2x speed sounds like a chipmunk
grian is probobly one of the richest hermitcraft player ever
WONK
As a Monxx fan I can only approve the wonkyness of these buildings :D
When Grian said he would be selling deepslate  Me: YES!! ( I love deepslate)
Theee numbers of subscribers     Edited: 69 :D
to the name of the alley Ziggy town? or Ziggy road
i like how even when Grian plans out scars mountain, he outlined it bigger than mumbos
Grian's worst enemy is?  Terraforming
Name the alley way silicon valley
Call it the mega alley
If You had a nickel to the disappointment in numbers I’m feeling you’d have 90 nickels
Name the alley "The Galley" Grian + Alley = Galley
with your base at the end where your main building will go, keep gaps from the others and make 2 smaller paths coming off. then the one to the left or right could go into a little cavern by the sea and the other could go to a higher or lower level. just an idea I had. the second tunnel (right side) could even go to your soon to be train station like platform 9 3/4
Grians base is gonna be sick
6.9M subscribers.          That's all I wanted to say.
I have a good name for your base Grian: Diagonally idk just an idea
Call the alley “Diagrian alley”
Hehehe wonk
Best episode EVER...  :)
Name the alley *the Scar's alley*
Griagon alley
Call The alleyway the Gallyway :/
What if to honor the inspiration, the alley would be called *Vertic Alley* as a nod to Diagon Alley (plus, more puns for the season XD)
Why dont you name the bank   "Griangotts"  And the alley  Griagon Alley
Diamond Alley pronounced like Diagon Alley.
Well then I'm looking forward to a server apocalypse
For the name of the alley, I feel like you could do a play one words similar to "Diagon Alley." I think a good one could be "Vertic Alley," playing on the fact that it is under a tall mountain
The name for the allyway can be mountain way
grian has 6.9 mill subs      nice
16:31 made me feel so bad
NUMBER 4 ON TRENDING
I like the name "The Unnamed Alley"
W O N K
call the alley griagon alley
The Bank at the back is going to be called "Grian-gotts" isn't it 😂
I think that grian's base should be called Variety Alley. because he is build various kind of house in the alley :D
6.9M subs
For Season 7 grian made a barge which travels on water for season 8 grian made a train which travels on land so for season 9 he should do something that flies
U can use scar's wagons as a delivery truck where he drives from base to base and finally the to the factory
you should call the alley  dia-GRAIN alley
Name for alley grigon alley
I'd say that there is certainly a sufficient amount of wonk.
Wow 6,9 million subscribers
I think calling it "Valley Alley" is to much on the nose.
Grian is slowly building Unlondon and I'm scared of what he's prepping for
Good job on reaching 3rd on trending
How about Griangotts bank or Griagon alley?
You should name your alley "The Galley"
It could be named the graly way comment on this comment what you think it should be named 😃😃😃😃
He has 6.9 mil!!!
Grian, you should call your alleyway Gralley.
I would name the alley "the Wonderers alley" or the wonky alley
If the deepslate is selling too fast increase the price.  Don't feel guilty it's basic business, if the hermits don't want to pay they can mine it themselves.
Hermit hallway
Grian most of your reference pictures were from diagon alley so yeah if you don’t put a dragon on the bank uhhhhhh just do it I know you know and i think you know that I know
"Gralley" seems nice
I love how the hermitcraft kind of has its one econemy
You should call the alley “griagon alley”
The bread boulevard cause grain makes bread!
Grian Wonka
Lol you nearly Insta mine deepslate.  Me with my efficiency 3 diamond pick
You must add a tiny chinese tea house in between 2 huge houses, because its a family business and they refuse to sell their plot to a major corporations :D

Id charge a dia block for two stacks of deep slate
Name it: "The unnamed Allyway
Idk about the alley, but I thought whichever house you put your bed in should be called "Griangotts."
You missed an opportunity to add an s to your sign. "Scar builds here!!!"
Wonk wonk wonk wonk
It should be called diagrion alley
Griangon Alley 🪄
The music Grian has been using for the time lapses lately.... takes me back to Maple Story Revolutionary Army with the Mecha Rider class
He should have named the trident " Tri-dent in my funds "
Hi Grian you could call the Alleyway the Griallyway
Is everyone just gonna completely ignore the random awooga sound at 18:21?
Now everybody is close living to each other the episodes are a lot less productive😂
Griagon alley is what I shall call Grian's base. Griagon alley is really coming along!
oh Grian, learn from the pros. You don't need to make profit on every item you sell. You can use deepslate as a reason why people should come to the GTrain, and while there are there, buy some of the stuff that does earn you diamonds
Imagine showing a minecrafter in 2010 the alley grian is doing in 2021. They would probably have sensory overload from all the different blocks and palettes
funny word *wonk*  Ely: am i joke to you
How far does water fall into the void? Could you use a waterfall to make an emergency escape from the void?
Ethos selling tridents i think?
The actually stopsign thoracically reply because poet methodically supply beside a poor plasterboard. short, spiky supermarket
If you make a bank, please name it Griangots. It fits with the Diagon alley theme.
the kag war have started
I'm sorry but can we apricate Grians flying skills at the end there?! My guy pulled off a rocket *millimeters* from the ground...
24 grain street (yes I mean grain and not grian because its a throw back to season 6
Instead of diagon alley name it horizontalley
The dynamic synergy between Mumbo, Scar and Grian it’s so heart warming the boundless amounts of joy they bring is unreal… three legendary Men bring so much… I wound raise my horn in their honour
Wonk’s  ally
I just taught of a great name for the alley : Grrrrrian alley 😂😂
grain has 2 brain cells too? I thought that was only for mumbo!
call the alley way DiagonAlley because the alley way it kind of diagonal
2:24 Is that fate giving us some foreshadow?
Hi grian your base and other base are very cool and i watched you from season 1 until season 8
I think botem folks should just stick to leather armor or something...it comes in a variety of colors, and easily replaceable when they inevitably fall in the hole.
Grian if you see this name it Griagon Alley.
Name idea for the alley: Accidental Alley! (pun on accidental ally, which is when someone tries to be LGBTQphobic but says something that is actually helpful by accident because they don't really understand the things they hate - also there is a big and hilarious reddit page with memes about this I absolutely recommend it)
Scar had died again by then hands of Grian due to a prank
13:55 LION KING REFFERENCE
Grian Shoukd have a completely collapsed building in the alley that collapsed from being too Wonk
"It took two hours to get 6 shulker boxes of deepslate" Me who is used to mining with only a diamond pickaxe Jesus Christ that is a lot
who would have thought that having an open hole to the void would have caused so much death
Invite wadzee and sb373 to hermitcraft!
Does anyone else get the golf video from season 6 recommended to them whenever they watch grians hermitcraft videos?
The Giagon alley?
The audio of him saying "these two buildings were a little too straight, so I added a little bit of wonk"  has so much potential
the G-rotto
«Place your shag here» hmm
"The Grigorian Alley"
Called IT in scars video. Only because grian didn't want to build the mountain
The G-Alley Galley
The G-Alley Galley
why can't scar do what he wants?
name for alley: Grianley
Firstt
Griagon alley
make the buildings in the ally way into storage spaces for other hermits, like they pay in diamonds for them
call the alley Fine Alley so when its done you can go "FINALLY"
You should make a magic themed minigame and have your alleyway sell tools to help you within the game.
Street idea wonky-way
I got kinda bored by grian diamond galorr
15:14 Would you like to speak about our lord and savior Jesus Christ
Call the base the Abnorm-ally
Gran. Am not gonna build a mega base this season also grain let’s build a giga base guys
BUILD GRINGOTTS
Call the ally Dia-mond ally, like diagon ally 🤭
Scar should have get out using a boat
THE HATTTT
I'm sure you've already thought of these sort of names for The Alley but a la HP's Diagon Alley how about: Basic Alley, Virtu Alley, Mystic Alley or my favourite Nonspecific Alley ;)
Funny how scar walked off by himself XD
Wonk
Grian you should call the ally Grian's deathly ally. ;)
When the alley is finnished, it will be a great finalley.
7:28 Grian needs to go to market   3 stacks 2 diamonds brother go for shopping more
The "Wonk Alleyway".
Yo, you could totally price deepslate at 3 or 4 diamonds per stack and people would still buy it
Sooooo funny. Just brilliant.
Call the alleyway "wait, this alley isnt diagonal! They lied to me!"
Grian: Mining deepslate is so painful, only 3 blocks per second Me, using my stone pickaxe and shovel to level a monutain: bruh
"place your SHAG here"
I really love the music this season
Scar build here!!!
Oh so that was what happened. I was wondering what Grian and Scar were back in Bdubs livestream. Oh so that happened 😂😂
Grian, here's a fiew recommendations for a name for your base (shh, it's free real estate) : B/T oat Alley , Vertique Alley , Intrav Alley, Monument Alley, Dillid Alley, Farcique Alley, (Bon) Jovi Alley, Roy Alley.
It should be diamondgone alley
Hey grian  you should get full netherite armor
Name the Alley "Horizont Alley" like Harry's mistake with the flu powder in chamber of secrets
I don’t blame you Grian the lag stole the Copper
Me when he said he was making a bank at the end of the alleyway: Diagon Alley? Me when he showed a picture of Olivanders’s wand shop: DIAGON ALLEY!!!!
Call it Vertic-ally
I don't know why grain didn't say the strange potato man. In mumbo video he did. But now here it's not there. WHY?
Name the alley the mega giga boatem alley or boatem alley
grian, mumbo borrowed your beacon as always
The building that was inspired by olivanders should be stocked with a bunch of sticks in chests.
I would be cool for the bank to be the barge.Just sayin
It is the GALLAY Grian
If when hermits say things like "54 diamonds, not too shabby" I get a little depressed about how long it takes me to get diamonds 😂
you could name the alley the bending alley
Grian!!! You should’ve done maps like last season about the progress of Boatem
19:07 whats the name of this song? Im looking for it since hermitcraft season 7 the beginning.
Grian call it Tryagon ally because it spikes at the end and is a long triangle
Who could have ever predicted a giant hole into the void right in the middle of town would have had unintended consequences!
It's just hilarious how entirely boatem want Scar to build something when he literally stuck in the boatem hole
You gotta do gringots bank at the end. You should also do a huge basement for all your farms then you can have the buildings at the top be where all your farms store the things they produce.
The alley should be named the *galley*
My name my suggestion   Cobbled cave ally
I think the Alley's name could be Grianalley!
name suggestion for the alley:  griagon alley oh and for the bank griangots
Grian at 8:56 you state an inspiration photo witch is a sewing shop that my nana manages and I just thought that, that was pretty amazing and i can't wait to show the staff that work there and my nana!
Without further a do.... music to my ears 😉😆 🥰 Really brilliant episode, as always G. I love that my kid, thankfully, chooses to watch you over Disney! We think you're awesome. That scene between you and Scar was too funny. So enjoy watching you! ❤️
Someone remix that! 4:16
Grian: The barge can eat its heart out The Barge: :(
OMG WHAT ABOUT THE “*DIAGONAL ALLEY*”!!!!!????!!!
Grian has a god pc but he isn’t even close to 15 render distance, while I’m on max render distance on my ps4, I can’t believe how easy it is to run bedrock compared to Java
Grain I want your Gmail please
I feel the again should be BIG to?
By the way I'm trying to get 1 k subs properly not going to but I really want to  be in the hermit craft server next season:(😔😔😔😔😔☹☹☹🙁🙁😟😟😟🥺🥺
I have an idea for the name for the alley... Norm-alley
How do I join hermit craft
Badtimeswithscar
I showed the alley to my brother and he said it should be called the mine-agon alley and I lost it 😂
recommendation Grian is to make the G-train shop look like a IRL-train & with detailed tracks connecting the Isle whilst having a minecart track inside those rails that is a delivering system for requests.
the void has more gear than everyone else at this point
The galley Or grian alley
Scar getting stuck in the hole with Grian taunting him is very Silence of the Lambs.   "you build your base behind my base or you lose your stuff again".
Grian: Deepslate is not fun to get!  Me: grinding for like 5 hours to get sand & gravel is ALSO not fun to get
The G-alley Way!! Thank me later, Grian. Lol
the boatem is hungry
Grian street but it’s pronounced green street ya know for the ally
grian why don't you sell diamond??   2 blocks of diamond for for 20 diamonds
Yayyyyyyy
Grian: very, very original, and creative names Me after I heard the names: one of them sounds kinda sus  Why does my brain react when he say “that”, I regret it
Grian, I know, you probbably wont see this, butt I just wanna tell you that you are the most likeable minecraft creator ever and thank you for doing all those crazy shenaningans just to entertain us
The alley should be called "diamond alley" where you sell stuff, make challenges and show off your diamonds to the hermits
Me who doesn't have a beacon: this looks pretty fast Grian: Pathetic
Please please please please please please please name the alley vertic alley because instead of diagon alley (diagonally) its vertic alley (vertically)
Yay grian is on 6.9 m the lucky number
The copper will Oxidize faster if spread apart, but if you are just using it to show how much you spend on your amazing builds, just ignore me. :)
"The Wonky-Way"
You call you giga base a Bigabase Like because it just bigger and bigger ephemeral scar cough cough pearl and also just boatom
Grian cigan
6.9m les gooo
Good job on 6.9M!
its like grian is rebuilding aquatown
"A contract is a contract is a contract… but only between Ferengi." Brunt
Is the alley way designed and based off of diagon alley
The Gal'o'way
Wtf xd
Congratulations on 6.9mil 🥳
name for the alleyway: grimoore wallstreet
"The galley way"
Grian why dont you make the copper dam 2 wide and get twice as much?
why did anyone think building a massive hole in the middle of their living area would be a good idea lol
“I’m gonna collect and sell Deepslate” Me: *Hands in Head*  Edit: When this comment was edited, Grian was at 6.9m subs. Nice! Edit 2: Grian renamed Scar’s replacement sword to “Subscribe to Grian” lol
I think this is a good name for the ally bout water ally Or wonk bout ally
Horizont-alley
Congrats on 6.9M😩😂
Instant Scarma!
Make the centerpiece a rundown slummy police station and call the whole place “Alleyby Hall”
Me be like to my friend in our survival world: your diamonds, beacon and armour lagged into my chests
ye know what they say.. when ye put a trap for someone, ye fall innit instead
Hermit alleyway
omg off-camera mining
Haha that’s funny
The alley way should be named the "G way" sponsored by the G train
Grian mentioning the apocalypse of a server is a tangible threat. Beware the winner of 3rd Life, the Dreamkiller, Mother Spore and Warmonger of the Hermitcraft Server
a good name for the ally could be the shallow ally, i think it sounds neat and also sounds a bit like shadow ally but i think shadow ally is a bit much
Grian building diagon ally without even knowing it
"i added a little bit of wonk"
Perhaps you can call your alley Vertick Alley?
The g-alley
I have a suggestion for The alleyway (its bad but it could do) BEHOLD!! *THE GRALLEY WAY*
An idea for the G-Train: Have a carriage selling limited time stock (LTS) that once it’s gone it’s gone, if it sells well or you think it’s a good to stock make a permanent carriage selling it!
Grian: If I don't finish something by the time this oxidizes, the server will result in an apocalypse.  Me: Knows that in reality he will start one himself.
A name for the alley, since HP is like diagonally... Boatem alley or Boatemally
Make the big building at the end a poultry man statue
Grian should put a cauldron as it is semi inspired by diagon alley
18:20 *Scar thinking noises*
Hermitcraft smp is just, the players make mind-blowing builds, increasable idea, great roleplaying
The copper dam 'lagged' back into existence  XD
congrats on getting trending again G!
Grian: so what are we doing today? Me: losing your stuff again😂
U should name the alleyway cristabloom alley
It's "Place your SWAG here", not shack. A swag is rolled up bedding.
Grian, you should call your base "DiaGrian Alley" cause it keeps reminding me of Diagon Alley and we all know how much of a potterhead you are
Grian you can make a buliding white colour
The Boatem Hole must be fed
DiaGRAIN alley
the grand grian ally way
18:37 HOLE-d on

Pain
Grian you should call the alley Alley G lol just a little pun as that’s what you were going for this season

Congratulations on top 3 trending
You should build the underground rail system like in the movies and also the dragon that's protecting the entrance
Grian is the best but most awful friend, Grian helps Scar get out and proceeds to kill him LMAO
You guys should make a city without much diversity and just make a government with a bank, court and other stuff
I know some supply and demand rules The stock of deepslate is very limited, and the demand is high I'd say you should raise the price by a diamond or 2
The Valley Alley?
Diamonds are less valuable than iron, change my mind
Wow!
18:42 scar: long live the king Just like in the movie
You should name the ally diagonally
The Alley reminds me of The Drag from WoW (pre-cataclysm)
7 milions hype
Is anyone else getting Sherlock Grian vibes from the second house?
Grian: We need to make it more clear to get scar to build something...  Me: Scar, move your butt and start building something other than wagons!
Big building at the end of the allyway? Please oh please make it gringotts!!!!

2:45  "Where the big bank or something..." Very gringottish
The ally that must not be named
Hey you can get more diamonds whit a beacon example 1 diamond click many time and now your now freee diamonds

the anger in grian's voice after scar pushed him down a second time lmao

Hey Grian!! I know you love building your copper dam but it will take too much time to oxidise, you have to place 2 copper blocks with the gap of 4 block and the age really fast.

For the name of the Alley, How about Griadon Alley?
Grian: today we will be sending scar a message  Viewers:last time that happened, it started a war To be honest Im really excited to see what war type story line that this season takes, if I was a hermit I would want to stay on the good side of grian as he has started/won the two wars

Thats Ollivanders? Thats a good inspiration.  Also someone commented a name for the bank thingy and it was Griangotts. Please I ask you to name it that.

The timelapse music is just too chef's kiss
"so that scar can start build some mountain" grian thinks this is genious.... until he finds out scar wants to build a castle in the clouds

Suggestion for ally name - Grian's ally = Gally
You made a case system
At the end of the corridor you could make a building... Gringots-like. So it kinda looks like Gringots with all the white and the dome. And you could call it Griangots.

Jj
Let me guess the ally is Diogon ally
Grian:  Imma add some wonke to this
I mean when you think about it, a gigabase technically isn't a megabase, so grian never lied
You could call the alley “griangon alley” and have a bank at the end called “ griangots”
grain congrats on 6.9 million subscribers. :0
What will the building at the end called?        Graingotts
16:34 Instant Karma is GLORIOUS
you should name the alley way grian-al alley
The bank should be an iron farm
While mining Deepslate, you sould mine tuff too (it's a good block for building and a little hard to collect)
From now on you have to put all your stuff in an enderchest and use some backup stuff
Horizont alley seems like a fitting name
You got a g train so why not a g alleyway
14:46  meW
Name the alleyway  Gralliway (grian + alleyway)
Since the inspiration is mostly Diagon Alley, why not name it Horizont Alley or Vertic Alley?
So .. The alley is based, roughly, on the set of Diagon Alley. Which is word play for Diagonally. Using similar wordplay, in a way that hints at the original inspiration, why not call the alley Horizont Alley, or Vertic Alley?
Grian make a bore drill ore and deepslate
Grian be making Diagon alley  I approve Please make this post popular so he sees it
Grian you should call it the galley (ship reference)
Grain: * sees scar stuck in the hole” Scar:” please help” Grian: ok, fine but first you build the mountain in the spot I choose so I don’t have to do much to the back. Scar: “ok ok just pls let me out” Grian: *thougha ender pearl to him*  Let’s watch scar mess this up come how”  *Nearly dies in boatom hole, because he didn’t make a jump of 1 block* “Scar and me: hahaha lol 😂 “ *grain breaks the block scar is standing on* “Scar: I DONT HAVE ROCKETS!” *grains realisation* jumps after scar throwing rockets into oblivion* *scar dies in the void. Grain died in the void* “Both of them ;-;” Me: (.w-w.) *exhale* that was the best emotional roller coaster ever! Grain: *tries to make it up to him and get back scars stuff. Scar: buy me trident? Scar: 0><0 Grian:  Ok that was probably one of the most hilarious thing I have seen.
The deep-slate build looks like a hotel so you should make it a villager breeder of some kind
Call it 'dencity'
are you going to build the under ground part of the bank the cart that takes you to the walts
Name idea : the ally that shall not be named
"Place your shag here"
Just like the alleyway was called Diagon alley you should name this one - Vertic alley
How about “Gryon Alley” ? HP reference
5:31 my man legit built an entire cave system because he wanted to mine some deepslate
why not just go with Griangon Alley
call it diagrain alley or something like that
I GOT A NE FOR THE ALLEY IT IS        Wroogcave  Alley. PLS use this Grian.
Grian: CopperDAM Me lives in the Netherlands: RotterDAM
Since the name for the train is the "G-train", the alley could be called "the Alley G". :D
The name of the bank should be graingotts
It clearly says: Place your Shag here.  Now that is some high end flirting.
5:25 a cobble of long hours ;)
Imagine if Grian named the alleyway the Gallery (grain + alleyway)
Petition to stop killing scar in the void
The big building should be gringots bank to keep the diagonal alley theme going
"I DONT ACTUALLY HAVE ROCKETS!" -Scar, in the middle of being murdered
maybe you can instamine deepslate with netherite?
My 9 year old son suggests "nocturn alley"
Activate my two brain cells to remember how to spell😭😂
bruh just let him build where he wants to lol
Rip stuff
Oh god he lost it all again
the bad thing is, I would've done the same thing. In that my moment, all I was thinking was, "scar's in an awfully comprising spot right now, what if you just..." 16:31
6.9 million subscribers special I’ll come back if he gets 69 mil subscribers
About the copper dam, you can un-weather the oxidised copper blocks with an axe
2:46 BUILD GRIANGOTS
he gotta add gringots to "the ally"
Pearl: turn Grian: WoBbLe
Grian season 7 : Lets build barge as a shop Grian season 8 : Lets build train as a shop Grian season 9 : Lets build plane as a shop
When you fly out of scar wagon it reminds me to Sherlock Grian.
At 15:02 scar started to mine bedrock, you can do this in minecraft so it is retextured cobblestone, kinda sad that its fake
Grain be like:for the diamon
Could name it the carpal tunnel after what im assuming this much minecraft does to your hands
mabye if you feed the boatem hole, it won't try to eat anyone else?
You can name youre base GRIAN STREET OR GRIAN AVENEUE
The deplesate building in the photo was looking like a combination of first building and deplesate one. And you didn't say how the creeper farm is doing.
I thought scar wanted to build a bioshock city in the sky?
You know you can dupe items right?
Grains mafia interrogation tactics is a thing of beauty lol
În season 6 civil war, season 7 mycelyum resistence, season 8 free war ,end crystals...  Who knows what is going to happened?
Grian should name the alley Diagrian Alley
Diagonal alley  maybe?
The farther u mine away the quicker u mine it
please gringotts bank
make the bank griangotts
Hermitgon alley
You should call it boatagone ally
Seriously the boatem hole is like the best worst idea ever
Suggestion: Name the alleyway: "Willy Wonky's Wonky Alley" lol or just simply: "Willy Wonky's Alley"
Why not call it Griagon Alley? 😂😂
You have to call the alley way griagon alley
Not sure if you're taking requests, but how about Hermy Road as the name of the alley?  ...yeah I'm not that good at this.
This season is the season of losing and puns.
Is it just me or does one of Grian's builds look like Olivanders Wand Shop? Oh no I have just seen that was the inspiration (that was embarrassing)
Griagon ally
19:00 haha 👍 lol  2 episode ago it happen to lolz
The botem hole truly has had the taste of blood
Grian add One building is sesion 7 barch ?
Name for the alleyway: galley(grian’s alley)
Btw did anyone notice if you remove dot in subscribers number you get 69
grian i like your hermicraft series keep it up
You should call ur alleyway,”the wonky alleyway”
Grian needs to build gringots at the end of the ally
Grian, you do realize that Scar is making a sky base, right?
The moment grian said "I am going to send a message" The thought that struck me was  Turf War 2.0?????
you can make the centre of the Alley a storage system. you can connect all the farms to go to there so if you need multiple resources you can just go to the one building.
This is my official proposal to name the thusfar unnamed alley: "The Alley G". Thank you and goooood ... bye!
If ur gonna make a bank you should call it griangots
Diagon ally =diagonally  Grians ally=  vertic ally (verticallly)
pog-warts XD tbh thats what grian is going to build
Name it "Bread Alleyway"
Deepslate is the perfect justification to build a tunnel bore
Maybe you can also build the Knockturn Alley, as a complete opposite of your alley. Maybe very gray and dark.
Am I the only one the thinks that deepslate should have a crafting recipe from coblestone. Like maybe 9 cobblestone for 4 deepslate blocks
Get neternrite
*booties*
well, they always say 13 is unlucky
Name it Galleyway
Idea: call it the GALLEY (g-alley)
DaBaby!!!!!!!!
Name the alley *griand alley* :)
techno has cancer
Griangots
8:24 I still think you should go for Cave and Cliff Alley.
Do a mystery boxes
Bru
I already want to see how the shop will look like
name the alleyway: Alley-G. g for grian
dia-grian ally
Try diagonal-ally. See what I did there, Olivanders on diagonally so maybe diagonal-ally
He forgor that Scar had no Fireworks
The alley should be called the gralley
What if you call the alleyway 'The Galley'
6.9 m subscribers pog
You should call it "Griagon Alley"
Why not just call it "tealley"?
*Name it "The Alley Of Souls!"❤*
Place your shag here lol
It's Blockturn Alley
8:18 cave cavern
again call it griangon ally
PLEASE BUILD GRINGOTTS as the bank in the centre!!!
Grian: "I am goin to stock... deepslate."  Me, who has a mining outpost dedicated to mining deepslate:  O.O
call it griagon alley
Still voting for Notson-Arrow-Alley as a name, because you said the the alley is not so narrow. XD
Scar: Im stuck  Grian: You're in big trouble  Bedrock at 15:03 : I am breakable.
Well I don't even have a beacon or a enchanted diamond pickaxe
16:41  NEVER PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD
Wonkally
You NEED to build the Weasley shop🥺
Which one of your kids you love more Grian? the barge or the G-train Grian: I like them both equally Also Grian, whispering to the G-train : That's a lie, I prefer you
Griagon alley
Grian: "...sending Scar a message.' Me: Intense Hermitcraft Season 7 moments intensifies.
''place your shag here'' LMAOO
you can make deepslate limited edition
400 diamonds. Grian is going to sell diamonds for netherite
Name it Grian Grotto…
For the next death box, you should just rename every item to be default, but with a typo, just to annoy whoever gets the box every time they look at their items
Oh god scar and grians interactions are always hilarious for some reason 💀
I'm getting "It's just a prank bro!" flashbacks
"Scar, you are in so much trouble" sounds exactly how you'd talk to a toddler I swear :DDD
18:10 Something about Grian's "Oh no" here sends me cackling like a witch every damn time AHAHAHAHAHAHA
At 0:50 look on the right!
DO SKYBLOCK ON HYPIXEL!!!!!!! PLEASE
Sus because you are uploading soo quickly  Also name it grally way
Disclaimer: this is NOT hate or judgement in any way,just an observation.i think grian and the hermits make great content.  Scar wasnt actuall trapped in that bedrock cage. if you look closely at 15:04 you can see that the "bedrock" above scar has the breaking animation on it.this is because scar looked upwards an left clicked a couple times.however in vanilla minecraft you cannot get the breaking animation on bedrock,since as we all know,its unbreakable (in survival lol).this leads to the conclusion that set "bedrock" was just some other (breakable) block,retextured to look like bedrock. great vid tho :)
Make a cascino
Would be cool if scars build a cloud over those mountain
Grian you should make gringgots bank at the end
Gally?
How about The G Vally (name for the ally way)
looks like "place your shag here" lmfao
Call the alley something like diagon alley + shambles shambon alley or diagles alley
16:40 So… uh… Grian… what, um, what was your endgame there, bud?
Galley
If he isnt gonna build gringots im gonna cry
Since you collected so many diamonds from the barge last season and didn’t really use them until the very end, this season you should come up with a game that benefits you (like collecting something you need) and the prize will be someone getting the earnings from the g-train for a few days or something
grian: we dont allow window shopping here  creeper: I WANT TO SEE YOUR MANAGER!!!!!!!!
Just an idea: U should. Make some more wagons on the gtrain and rent them to people so they stock that wagon as their shop but have to pay like 20% of the profits as rent for the wagon
Deepslate is a pain to mine.  Me who has never gotten a beacon or had mending books, primary uses iron and diamond tools, and occasionally enchants. **Looking at the 'slow' mine** "Wow mining can get pretty fast lol"
The hole got hungry again
Da Grain Alley is coming together really nicely
Here's an idea for the name of the alley: Horizont-Alley
I had an idea, as grian said the alley was unnamed, since the original alley is called diagon alley he should call it diaGRIAN alley
here is an idea actu-ally
Griangotts bank
What is the second timelapse song?
Scar wants to build a cloud not a mountain!
3rd life :clay are diamonds Hermitcraft:deeslate are diamonds
w o n k
the wonky wormhole would be a great name!!
Call the alleyway , SALLY
*w o n k*
You could call it the Griagon Alley
Grian: We need to add more wonk   Me: Don't want to say that wrong
Losing things (again)
You can name the alley Griagon Alley lol
ugh! The lag on this server has to get fixed!!!
Fam theory: grian said at the end that if he doesn’t get something done by the time the copper oxidises there will be an apocalypse I think the next server war will be a zombie apocalypse where grian slowly infects other people and the infected people help him to make the server apocalyptic for a short time Idk it might happen Write in comments what else u think could happen
Gringott’s Bank
LES GO 6.9 M SUBS
After building the giga base they will have there own 1.18
So sad for you, grian.
Griagon Alley?
Name suggestion: scar of stone heart
You should call the bank griangotts instead of gringotts
Wonkawonk Alley
We get answers for Bdubs livestream 😏 Void dilemma explained!
Maybe grainyard alley? (The name of the alley)
Griagon alleyway?
Diagonal Alley
Next season "the G Plane"
this is where the fun begins
Base Name Ideas: The Cavern Grotto Deepslate Sanctuary  Edit: Build a Tavern/Pub And call it: The Wonky Diner
The Gralley
add a valley in the flat land in the middle of all the giga bases, its a bit weird to see massive mountains  suddenly then flat meadow land
Want more diamons? I suggest that you make some more farms like a guardian farm with impulse  and try undercutting iskall's prices. Its just a suggestion if you want to do it go and if not I understood it.
A stack should cost 42 diamonds each
So anyone are not going to talk about how the boatem hole is taking victim without any hermits noticing?
It would be cool if he made a secret entrance through a pub to the g train
16:05  wtf
name the ally griagon ally
When they are looking down the hole after losing there stuff they look like boys having thrown a ball through the window
Gralley or Galley?
G Mafia
Lag can be just sooo annoying, right? Haha 😄
Grian's Word of the Day: WONK
you should call the ally the gally (like grian ally). it’s also a play on words of galley as a galley kitchen is the counters on either side, like how the ally is going to be
6.9 mil subs Nice
How about "still like might still like tight Grains Town" Hey it's something You can either take it or leave it. It might not be the best title but it's something
Brian find a bastion in the nether it is way easier
Sjuksköterska its a swedish word.
Call the alley griagon alley
Build the back of your base please for the love of god
The anxiety I get when the title says "LOSING EVERYTHING (again)" and then Grian dances around the Boatemhole. I almost thought it was a troll title to trick us... but sadly no.
It's diagon alley
Moment of truth 16:34       Watch it again and again you will understand 😉😉😉
Using a wither to collect deepslate is quite efficient
grian you should call the alley' vertic alley'
Mojang should make mason villagers trade deepslate
brh is grian making the ally in a mountain so he doesn't have to deal with building the back of the houses he is making!  brh he is a big brain.
You need efficiency 5 golden pickaxe to get instamine
Hermitcraft needs a new rule: when you go in the botem hole you only have rockets and an elitra
"todays episode, we are going to be losing all of our stuff. you saw the title, so i am skipping to the jazz"
Those houses are wonky wonders
You guys are really smart
Townhall
I think you should call it di-a-mond alley because you are rich and you could make a few of the buildings that you can’t use into shops?
That defeats the purpose of encouraging scar to stop overthinking. 😂
Grian has 6.9M subs... noice.
Fix your ender Perl chamber to save you from the boatom hole
Is your base named gigalley
Grian i watched ur pranks vid thats how i found u but for me i love this better i get crazily mad if its done plus im a big fan^.^
Grumbot needs to be in the game of hermit craft season 8
Grian, You Should Name The Alleyway, Gway / Grianway
How about calling it the Anom Alley? :D
16:40 Karma😞
to be fair, Scar's last starter base was the enchanted forest
grian congratulations on getting top 3 on trending gaming
Deserved.
Easily the funniest episode this season
cause its like a ripoff
You can name it DiaGrain Alley and DoorGone Bank. Hehe puns
alley should be called lieagon alley
Only one will remember  but name th alley  architect alley
hey, i have an idea for you, 1.17.1 i found a really cool generation (It is a desert) its like 2 sand mountains and i feel like you as one of the best builders in minecraft could do something with it. its pretty much at world spawn too so i hope you can come up with something for it!  Seed: -7405331150352381809
You fool!!!
you could call the alley (grion alley)
wonkkk
Me selling deepslate one diamond one stack and I don't have a effincey 5 diamond pick ⛏️ by the way, no shulkerboxesa
We gotta tweet this to grian on Twitter,Instagram etc he has to make the Gtrain move using red stone so it does a giant loop all the way around the server
"I HAVE NO ROCKETS"
Is it a bird is it a plane no it’s a flying G-train. I laughed when I thought of it but i really think it would be cool to make a flying G-train or the rails go up and there’s another G-train
"place your shag here" has caused me to laugh for the past 5 minutes
Cmon let’s get this amazing guy to 7 million <3
How cool would it be, if Grian bild freaking gringgotts 😨 ad the end of the buildings
I think you should call your ally griangon
The G-Alley Maybe?
In my opinion: I think the name of the alley way should be The Gra-lly way! (in my opinion)😆
Grian dropping in front of car reminds me of that we’ve been trying to reach you about it cars extended warranty
Name suggestion: the Galley grian alley and galley like the ship continuing on the boat theme
on reddit the other i saw somebody telling u must sell potions on the gtrain with every gfuel flavuor
I’d say 2 for 3 is a fair price
Highest kill count: Boatem hole: uncountable Mumbo:killed
grainy wonka and the diamond factory graingoat bank
We have g train  How about g alley or galley way
6.9mill subs nice
Scar already has a mega base lol
Are you going to build gringots on the end of the alleyway?
"coppsterdam" how's that ??
You could call the alleyway ... wait for it... Grianally (like diagonally)
I think Griangotts would be a fun name for the bank
You Should Name The Ally Way "The Gralley" It Is A Combination Of Grian And Ally!
Call the alley a Galley? Like, you know, a G-alley
How about the griat alleyway that's pretty good ngl 🤗🤗🤗🤗
Well as always......  Looks like Grian never learn from experience
How about you "Fine Alley" name this place? 😉
Well, we got an awful lot done on this video Me: Well, we got an awful lot lost on this video
Hi grian i have a nice name for the allyway you can call it "Diagrianally"
Call it straightacross alley
Idea  Grian build a small version of your mansion at the end of the path   And a house can be a small version of your season6 base
You should call your base spelunk alley, I mean it sounds good and appropriate, since it is inside a cave
You should call the alley the “Galley”
They should make it so that whatever you make the beacon out of gives you a better boost. So farming for a Netherite Beacon will actually be useful and not for pleasing your eyes.
Definitely need to make the Grian-gotts Hermit Bank in DiaGrian Alley
tbh, after last season, i was expecting fresh concepts of this season going to be in terms of more interactions with hermits (such TEGG, those messed up end crystal thingy, tree skins lol) and some cool micro builds that spread around this giant island. At the beginning of this season, i was really hyped about how 4 hermits live alongside, the road to connect all of hermits, horses thingy, but here we are again to watch them to dealing with mega builds again and again. it doesn't mean that i hate it. i love and respect all decisions that hermits deal with (their videos brought plenty of joy upon these hard times tho), but yeah i would love to see some fresh interactions in the future. btw, stay safe y'all.
I know the pain of mining deep slate. I build a pretty small base out of it but it took sooo long lol
Hype 7 mil. !!!
Moving like a snail with the base not trying to be that guy but
Should have named the trident "tri dent-in-my-bank-account"
Name the alley Galley then add things to sell inside the buildings
it would be so awesome if the diagon alley was a shop!
grian name the ally way gally way or g-ally way cause comedy
call it "Griogon ally"  (Gree-Oh-gone)
Graingon ally
6.9 m subscribers 😏
I'd love to see gringotts like a Central structure in the diagon alley
Looking forward to the middle of the season where Grian starts a civil war, a revolution, or something insane like that
Grian, you should place the copper 1 block away from each other so they grow faster.
Buyhonally
Diagonally no not the fancy way just diagonally
The hollyway would be a cool way, bussiness in the front.....
He renamed Leggings for for leggies, Just imagine if he considered leggings as pants then it would have been panti-.
Grian: “now I do have a *slight* agenda…” Everyone: “we knowwww”  That being said the comparison with reference pictures was very cool to see.
i nominate that the alley way should be called the "Gralley way". I stand high with this opinion.
Make someone invite a youtuber called Wadzee too the hermitcraft server
*name the ally way door gone cus u had to steal doors last season *
2 hours I only got 6 shucker boxes
Well grian if you got those many diamonds when you were mining you would have gotten double the income
The Grakens lair
You show name it melly
Baragon Hall
it should be the gralleway
im sad theres no way to farm deepslate. its a wonderful block but is a limited one
R.I.P. Grians stuff again 2021-2021 Its was good stuff
Grian hope it's not too much trouble but I was thinking even if it was not at the entrance you could maybe make a leaky cauldron??? Pls?
Opening a hole to the void in the middle of their bases was an expensive choice. 😂
Grian alleyway grialleyway
Again
i think if he  decides to add a bank at the end of the alley he should call it griangotts or something
The alley should be called diagonal alley cuz the building are all kinda diagonal   Plus it’s based of diagon alley
The gally lmao
Call the alley diagrian alley
Call it dia-grain alley.
Youost probably won't see this Grian but you can have in the middle the boatem incorporated offices or something like that  Anyway keeps this yo love your vids
I find the best way to mine cobbled deepslate is with a wither. Some still gets blown up but it goes much quicker than by hand…
hey grain make a big buttom face statue of Mumbo the CEO name the ideas jumbo mumbo
You should name the ally the gally or wonkly
Is wonk a drug coz if it is I want it also name for the ally: the ally of professions
Griagon Alley
Names for alley:  Pewter Alley Septi Alley Ectie Alley Alley of Alley houses
name the ally way gally cause grian ally
name the build BOATEM BOULEVARD
6.9 million subs.  Noice.
I love to see bdub joining  botem
You should really consider a net in that hole
here’s an idea for your mountain: make iyour mountain merge mumbos and pearls by half of your mountain being mumbos style of mountain and half pearls style of mountain and make it like fade from pearls to mumbos
Is it a good idea to add a chimney in a cave alley??
Will Grian's Underdark Ally eventually lead to PearlescentMoon's Under mountain abode?  These are the questions that keep me up at night...
Just a helpful tip if you spread out the copper blocks they’ll oxidize quicker
Grain: "We do it for the Diamonds" also Grian: Had over 10 stacks of spare diamond blocks in the last season.
awkard allyway
"window shopping isn't allowed here" 🤣🤣
Please let the bank be griangotts
Grian’s shops  S6 : Sahara S7 : Barge/Great grian goodies 28 : G Train
Petition to put a the barge house on your base   Support me guys
so this is why you guys havent gotten netherite gear off the bat..... because u keep tossing each other in the boatem hole lol
IDEA: Gemspike alley... Light it up with amethyst crystals.
For the ALGORITHM
Build a bakery and sell grain... season 7 reference
My subtiles: allyway Me: *accidentally goes back 10 sec* My subtiles: allycave Me: *goes back to see what they really said* My subtiles: allybay Me: so now even subtiles are telling grian what he should name the cave
Griygon allay
Try using a efficiency 5 Gold Pickaxe to mine the slate. it might be fast enough for instamining when combined with a beacon
Grian's episodes: 10% building.  90% shenanigans
He made a cave system just for some deepslate
Name for the alley   Grianadon alley
Hey Grian! I think the best way to add some 'wonk' is to eat a pufferfish in you base ;)
Grian went from a small hobbit living in a dirt hill and selling with a big barge, to a dwarve living in an alley city mountain and selling with an industrial train
Hi grian. The alyy coud be named "the hermit Ally" (ps. Love your vids)
Grian for the bank build a tunnel system underneath with minecarts and dragons like gringotts
Build Gringotts in the back of the alleyway
You can name the ally 'Gally'  You know like grain's allay Gally...like The G train or grain... A bit of punny (a really bad one)
12:49
12:49

12:49
12:49
12:49

grian name the alley way  griagon alley

6.9 millions nice👌
I reckon you should call the alleyway “Deep Street” since the road is deep slate and you’re going further down
Creeper: Hey you. Yeah you kid. I got sweet a... AHHH!!!! Grian: NO solicitors!!!!
Haha he’s got 6.9mil subs
You should definitely build gringotts at the end of the alleyway
W O N   K
I was thinking 2 stacks for three diamonds too. Nice nice
Call it "Vertically"
Kinda wanna see a hermit take inspiration from 'Howl's Moving Castle'
Name the alley vertic or horizont, alley

Grian after dying its ok  When i die in minecraft rage quit
You can call it grilly way
I think he should call the alley boatemalley
Me in Normal survival and I lost loots:.... Me using creative: ok 100000 notch apple
Grian could make the central building as the boatem meeting area. Then add lots of death traps in it.
If the void had an inventory it would be stacked. 😂
That bit with Scar down in the hole was f-ing hilarious! I seriously needed a good laugh, so thank you! Sorry you guys lost your stuff though :(
cool.
Grian: "Scar build HERE!!!"    Impluse: "NO! Scar build HERE!!!"    PearlescestMoon: "OI!! SCAR, MATE, BUDDY, PAL!! PLACE YOUR SWAG HERE!!"   Mumbo: hey there buddy chum pal friend buddy pal chum bud friend fella bruther amigo pal buddy friend chummy chum chum pal i don't mean to be rude my friend pal home slice bread slice dawg but could you build here my buddy chum friend buddy pal amigo buddy friend chummy chum friend home slice bread slice pal.
For the back of your base, you could build a post office, and then if someone wants to message someone, they have to first buy wool and then bring that over to you, and then you'll do it. *Easy Stonks*
You should call it Giagon alley
According to the last few episodes, I think we can clearly tell that *The Boatemhole craves sacrifices*
13:38  *''hole-d on''*
The Ally should be griagon ally
can the big building be the gringotts bank
5:15 I am hoping with the 1.18 update, Mojang will increase Efficiency to 10 or something to make the process of collecting deepslate easier. and also making mining with beacon becomes therapeutic again.
scar: *gets stuck* grian: P  R  O  F  I  T
6.9 million subscribers nice
You could call it horizont-alley instead of diagon alley
Can we call Grian's base Alley G?
Wonkie alley
10:43 “Place your *Shag* here”  Uhhhhh….

NiCe SuB cOuNt GrIaN hEhEhE (6.900.420)

Hermits: why is grian stealing  Grian: LAGGGGGG

If its a very wonky alley... Why not name it Wonkalley.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "ONLY 6 SHULKERS OF DEEPSLATE???" thats, and I can not stress this enough, more than I owuld even be able to collect in a year.
The jolly golly alleyway is what I name it😁
Griagon Alley
#2 on trending wow (for gaming)
I got a wonderful name for your alleyway base- Let's call it the Grianalle
I love Grian and Mumbo’s relationship
Yo that geode on top of the diamonds and deepslate
20:12 "hElLo"  Scar said hello like he just wake up from a 5 months coma
again
No one:  Grain:   W   O   N   K.  This is a joke. DO NOT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY It’s meant to make you laugh
Seeing as all of the houses in your alley are quite slim and tall, why not call it "Vertick Alley"?
Blocky diagon alley = Cardin Alley, because in blocks there is really no true diagonals in Minecraft (except for lectern). Just cardinal directions, no diagonal. Also nice, 6.9m subs
Oogle alley
Boatingon alley!!!!!!!
I swear This has got to be the season with the most deaths to the void.
axie - Axie Infinity  silky - from Teen Titan Go
Grin gots
Hey Grian i’ve got a great pun name for the alley the **”CAVERNUE” ** like cavern and avenue stuck together 🤣
So if this season is a punny season… maybe call the Alley Griagon Alley Diagrian Alley Griangott’s Lair Griangott’s Alley  xD
I think the alleyway could be called the g-ally or (the one i like) the gally? (Sounds bad i know)
aleey name: dia-grian ally
The Grian alley way… The Galley Way!
Olivander *^*
I'm sharing my screen to mimi.
Scar will not hurt anyone’s feelings and build everywhere
Too much Vonk?  Let's build the Leaning Tower of Pisa
“Grain street” could be a good name for the alley
Moral of the story: never save scar
you should call the alleyway the "WonkyWay"

Awesome episode! Absolutely love the new buildings and the deal with Scar! Hope he builds where you want. Love the bit of you scaring him at the end! Wow deep slate is really popular! Keep up the awesome work! Have and amazing week! See you later!
Wouldn't netherrite make it faster?
"Its not about the money its about sending a message"
Grian:Builds the g train Also grian: stwonks
Also, Scar left it to the viewers for where hes going to build, but man I really hope he really does pick above your base... you and scar have such a hilarious and adorable chemistry together... so many funny moments, and I'm sure with your powers combined yall are going to make that mountian area absolutely stunning... I can't wait to see the epic colab
Pun chance for Grian at 21:33; he could’ve said acopperlypse instead.
It is the first time I saw grian roasting mumbo(12:09)
I recommend naming the alleyway "Gallery" for no reason at all...
Grian’s copper wall reminds me of that fortress from the geonosis episode of the clone wars
Next time you give scar a trident name it "if you need it i'll give you po-a-tri
Make an arrow pointing where to build
name the alley pog alley
Maybe make a very small house in the alleyway which is then bigger on the inside
I got a perfect name for the Ally way,  Call it the 'Wonky Ally'

Mumbai, Scar, Grian. MSG. Very addictive...
If items collected in a pile at the bottom of the void... there would be a scrooge mcduck sized pile of Boatem gear by now... by the end of the season you could arm a small country... xD
grian do you have a discord?
I miss chicken man 😶 thats all i got to say  😶‍🌫️
So you’re not going with DIGRIAN ALLEY. CMON ITS PERFECT
*Modstadnt Alley*
Mumbos base could be where they collect resources (farming) Impulses base could be the factory (Crafting) (I think it looks like a factory) and in Grians base could be where they sell what they’ve made.  And Scar can build a village, mostly for aesthetically purposes. Then they can split the income.  I’ve been thinking of that idea for really long now I’m finally writing it down.
Grian:time to use my two brain cells...and finish what i have not done last season...make scar finish the back of my build since i won the turf war.
Grian: "The unnamed alley way" Me: "Cavergon Alley"
My favorite part in the whole video 14:38
Grian: lets scar build the back of the base sort off. Grian season 7: does not build the back of the mansion till the end of the season  Me: i see a pattern i dont like
You with scar and the Laughter of Scar makes my day always And SO CLOSE TO 7 MILLION SUBSSSSSSSS
Mumbo’s router seems to have been unplugged
Hey grian are you going to build and grain station and you could name it diagrian alley
Grian you should name it cavagon allley
hahahahaha lol
call it Occasionally (occasion alley) the alley for all occasions
Just carry enchanted golden apples if possible and if you eat them falling into the void you can become immune for some time allowing you to get out
You should have pearl do the terrain for your place and have Scar build a huge base above your base and pearls
call it grian's grotto?
Grian, I think you should implement a small nocturne alley in your base. It would be awesome!
Grian you can just put curse of binding on your armour 😅 I know its not possible cause it's hermitcraft
Ah yes. Its time to add some wonk.
Grian I have an idea if you see this: The building at the back could be inspired by grigotts the bank so you could have a vault with all of your profits from the Grain. Btw this is just an idea do what you think is best.  Edit: if you too like this idea and think he should do it. Like the comment. Thanks
Why not name the g-train=grain
PAIN
yo grian since your inspiration for the alleyway is diagon alley you should name the alley way diagonal alley :D
Call the ally way  “The Gally Way”
Hey grian, u should name the alley the warped alleyway or the wonky alleyway!
Pay Bdubs to build the mountain?

You should name the alley “Diagon Alley”
I CAN BARELY BUILD A HOUSE

*jumps in hole of death* *dies* “Oh no” “Oh no this is really bad”  ...
When you finish making the copper dam. It remind me of a wall made out of iron to prevent Ya'juj and Ma'juj from coming out  into this world
sus to chair the redemption of mumbos base
Cavenue would be a good name. Although it makes a pun out of avenue instead of alley.
Hey you can call the alley the diamond gon alley

"the alley that shall not be named" sorry gotta say it.
You lost your stuff with somebody at least.
Yo Grian, Spacing out the copper blocks weathers it faster
You should add the half mansion in the alley
"Only six shulker boxes full of Deepslate"

“Oh these two diamonds? Awww it lagged into my inventory!”
Grian, Grian, Grian. You forgot a comma, man.
Make a mappppppppppp
Lmao the G alley
hey grian how about you put all your diamond in the big bank
If you're having issues with beacons going missing, maybe you should ask Mumbo if he can build you a secure Kgoomr.  As for the alley name, after hearing you describe all the building as being wonky I've taken a liking to "Wonkey Way"
Gringotts
Wonk!
Grain has changed, he is not the same way he was in season 6 and the beginning of season 7. He simply wants to be "the" hermit. Have you realized something, he has never said anything good about mumbo's base, though has applauded each and every other boatem base. I do not know if this is strange. Sad to see grian like this,
If you ever do build a locomotive, maybe move the deepslate trailer into a coal car for some detail and functionality!
lets call it "wonk-way" lol
I kinda wish the train lined up with the base entrance
Wow the building song is very nice
12:03 dream trying to explain how he didn't cheat
Please dont take this the wrong way but I sincerely hope you guys never get netherite armour and tools. Imagine losing those items over... and over... and over...

The chemistry between Scar and Grian is off the charts in this one !!
“Doesn’t it have curse of binding on it?” “No it doe- oh no”
Day 3 of telling grain he should call the alley  Horizont-alley.
16:40 man, that's some rough karma
the alley should be called the," Wonky Alley."
DragonEgg Ally, then put the egg there
Sounds normal

Diagon alley is well diagonally so why not call it the Katty Corner for, cattycorner.
"digrian alley"
At the end of the season can we get a body count of how many people were eaten by the boatem hole?

Can't feel bad about killing scar, he would have killed you too

Totem alleyway should be a suitable name
5:00 try doing it w/ no beacon and no efficiency 5
for the alleys name Talley
when Grian sells anything grain related the G Train will be called the Grain
13:00 this entire part could literally be an animatic and I'd love  to see it
u can ally way 'gally way'
I swear I’ve already watched this like 2 weeks ago lmao
Instead of diagon alley you should name it diamond alley
1:28 anyone know what keyboard shortcut that is where you pick the same block without opening your inventory?
The boatem hole was a bad idea, change my mind.
Make the deep slate very expensive
Griagon Alley
F in the chat for Grians stuff
I personally would have charged way more for the deepslate I mean 2 diamonds for a stack thats a major steal
20:12 that hello was exactly like a cat waiting for it's owner to give it food.
Peaky Blinders
Wonky Alley!
Grian+alley=The Gralley or Wonklley

Can someone tell me why using your rockets in the void doesn't work
Well, how about Grians Grinners. You know, after weasleys wizard wheezes
Do we have a death count for the Void yet?
This wasn't funny
"2 hours ONLY got me 6 shulker boxes of deepslate"  2 hours only gets me like 3 stacks of cobble
Let’s face it. The best buildings are the weasley shop and grindelwalds
“Too straight”   Lmao me a closeted lesbian when deciding on an outfit
The buildings are all crammed together, so it would be cool if there were some spaces for branching paths
Call it the Wonky Way
Name it... Disco Rd... everybody loves goin' down to Disco Road!
Lol, taxation is taxation.
Lazy grian
What's with grian and back of things?
here we go again with Grian's "It was just a prank"
Don't know who this grain character is that everyone is talking about
Call it Boatem alley
Weak Grian: _sniffles_ I don't wanna build the back of my base! I'll just build a base with no back so I don't have to build a back! _cries_  Chad Brian: I'll build a base with two fronts! That way there is no back to build and the entire base looks good from all angles! Yes! I am the greatest! Hahaha! _jumps straight up with such force that he propels himself into low earth orbit_
"The G Alleyway" for the allyway
I hope you make "Griangotts"
cool
“ losing a trident and making someone buy one off of you”  Scar: S T O N K S
since your inspiration came from diagon alley, it'd be cool if you name your base "diamond alley''
Not waking the house up with hysterical laughter was difficult
Plot Twist: The Boatem Hole was made to sell more Did You Die Boxes
how confuse he will be
At this point the boatom hole is gonna fill up soon. The entire void will be filled up
DUDE IF YOU TAKE UP SCARS OFFER YOU'LL GET LIKE 44 AND BIT OF DIAMOND BLOCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Origin Alley / Ori-grian-alley?
I don't know if you've seen Diagon alley at Universal Orlando but they have this Dragon on top of a bank I believe and I think that concept would be really cool at the end of your crevice in the middle! Just a thought!
the boatem people are gonna lose stuff a LOT
Wonk
Scar wants ~four~ more boxes? I mean, I know he dies a lot but... what is he really planning on doing? >_>
at the end of the cave put a MASSIVE office so the other hermits will be imtiminated
Diagon Alley!
Gotta get some *~wonk~*
Grian could name the alley diagonal alley,
I feel like a good name for the alleyway would be "The WonkWay" xD
So basically deep slate for you is a loss, but a loss towards marketing sales..
Have Grian stocked up alot of elytras???
Name for ally bay is grally bay for grian
if he does make a bank at the end it could be called 'Griangotts'
Scar actually fell by him self lol hahaha
wow he really got a notch apple and didn't even mention that.
I too had succumbed to the void before this in my own world. I feel better now
maybe you can sell glowstone in the g train
You should call it the backside alley😂😂😂
Scar Messages are turning into War...
Pro tip: Don't die
Bit of wonk 😂
Iskall deeplsate diamond ore House 2.0 .. think about it .. possible sales pitch.
You should call The Alley Way, The Galley Way. It makes sense.
Diagrian Alley!!!
You kinda sound like Tom Holland.
Name the alleyway: Dia-grian alley :D
amethyst alley
The boatem hole is just a major danger at this point. Damn, always has been.
I suggest"Dragon Alley" for the name because it sound like diagon alley and it just gives me cool ideas,like building a dragon to rival treesa
Just call it the boatem ally
Grian  Stay, OUT OF THE VOID
15:02 Did that Bedrock just emit breaking? Because two pixels came out on where Scar's head is rn.
You should call the alley, the grian grotto
Hermits startling Scar is always adorable
U should call your build trigon alley
build Griangotts to the back
so grian you need a name for your alley that is in a cave so what about calling it 'caven alley'
Grian: I want scar to build riiiiight here.  Also Grian: literally points to the whole of a direction.
Wonkigon Alley
Grians alleyway should be called Griagon alley
Galley way
Hear me out: Horizont Alley
Call the alley Diagrian Alley
Hi Grian You should make a G VAULT to keep your valuables in a vault and other hermit's valuables in other vault and give them a key to access the vault.  This could be use for the center building
@Grain the ally way I don't know what to call it.....bro your building Diagon Ally....
"then the server will result in an apocalypse" as if Grian doesn't cause at least one apocalypse every season anyway
Do you regrret the botem pole now
he should make the big building at the end of the alley “griangotts”
The Maui alley  For your cat
Idea: put limited time items that you don't want to restock in the train car with deepslate
You should call the alley Horizont Alley. That way you can keep going with the puns
Wonky Town or Wonky Alley
Love your vids
finaly vid bro dang
I honestly like of the name of the alley I made, its called               “Sideways Valleyway”
Grian why don't  1 You put the hq of the G Train in your Alleyway 2 Make your own little shopping district in your Alleyway. (People can come and use your mob farm) And 3 Can you make a tunnel and tracks in your alley so occasionally a small cart ( I dunno what it's called. It's like a lever where you push up and down to make it go.) Comes by and sells a few boxes of stuff from the G-Train
You should name the alley the G-alley
You could build griangots
DIagon-ally... no more questions
G-alley. Something like that.
I kinda wish they had kept the original name of Grimstone. That sounds cooler than Deepslate in my opinion.
Hey
G-Alley The Galley
Grian has 6.9ml followers now congrats grian you've come so here I've been here since u have 3.9ml followers😊🎉🎉🎉
You should make a bank and name it Griangots
Grain and Scar are my favorite duo. They’re both so chaotic but also light-hearted.

Grian next season THE G PLANE
Alright it's time to subscribe
Griangom Alley
name the ally "the grally"
Still saying that having power lines or clothes lines, or even tiny sky bridges between the houses would make it come together really well
Why have you not just called it DaGrian alley
Ugh that lag was so bad
the lag is real
The ally could be called "Deepslate Pathway"
Logs Are easy to get for me
We should call it Boatially way matches boatem a bit
Try using gold picks for mining deepslate, they are slightly faster and maybe able to instamine them
*“It isn't a episode without Grian falling in the boatem hole lol 🤣”*
Name your base Gally. It’s simple and efficient. Grian+Ally
Also (third comment I have posted on this vid) why don't you make the Alleyway a shopping area in the whole Boatem Incorporated business, since you wanted to make each building a farm of some sort, each building can sell the items you are farming in that building. Also (not taking credit for this name, saw it on a different comment) why don't you call the alleyway, the "Galleway or G Alley
May I suggest the name Caverndale if you're still looking for names?
Anyone else getting major downtown evo vibes from the Alley
2:57 do you see a face?
LMAO when grian forgot scar doesn't have anymore rockets and he was trying to give him some XD
Hey Grian! You're likely not going to read this, but this video was the best part of my day. I always look forward to your videos and today I just needed one so bad, and you delivered. Thanks
You can call your alley thunder rain alley
I had a terrible day at my new job today, I can't tell you how happy I am that I came home to find a Grian video waiting for me
The alley should be called the G-Cave to go with the G-train
A whole episode without End Crystal? :(
“The Galleyway” pronounced gA-Lee-way, could be a cool name for the alley! Like Grian and alleyway combined?
Oh wow that lag! So annoying!
maybe call it the diagrian alley???
Scar wants to build something like aether, floating platforms in the sky.
wait what he say he have 2 brain cells and then he builds mega and so decorative bases thats means we have only 0.0000000000000000001 brain cell cuz we not build mega bases , nice grain
Call it Alley-oop
Karma x Karma x Karma *Grian x Scar
In bedrock edition you can actually instant mine deepslate
It maybe too simple but The galley? Grian's alley, every boat has a galley.
ally way more like gelly-way
Just a suggestion, you should make something like Gringotts but it’s a meeting room or a big office at the end of the building, and villagers to trade with in the colossal hall on the way there
Griangot’s bank?
Boatem hole is contending with grian on hermit kills
bit funny that 3 or possibly 4 different Hermits decided to build mountain cave bases this season
Scar:I’m stuck in a hole Grian: Holed on Ahhhhh the puns
🎉 Congrats on 6.9M 🎉
he should put the boatem inc HQ at the end of the alley
Do dia-Grian alley or dia-green alley
At what point does Scar start faking boatem hole deaths to get free Perhaps you Perished Parcels?
Grian: 2 hours of mining only got me 6 shulker boxes of Deepslate. Me: 3 years of me playing Minecraft hasn't got me out of the Nether alive with 1 blaze rod
Name It gygonally (guy gon ally)
Don’t forget about diamond chandelier
Grian, I have the perfect idea for naming the Alley! You need two signs and it would involve a second street running in front of the bank (the to be determined building). One street (the main one you are building now) is called Accident Alley, and the second perpendicular one is called Wonky Way. So you can tell someone to meet you at the corner of Accident Alley and Wonky Way.
Da-grian-alley
YOU SHOULD NAME IT Gally way
A surprising amount of void deaths this season
I haven't  been keeping up with hermitcraft season 8 :/
I have an idea for the alley's name! Use a block you use a lot as the name, like deepslate alley, cobblestone alley, etc.
Name your base 'The Great Grain Galley'
Excellent episode & very funny! One day maybe we could see all the work that goes into a Perhaps You Perished box! I know others would maybe be bored, but I wouldn't! Anyway, onwards and upwards!
Name the ally " the Grially "
Alternate title: throwing my time away. Lol Grain put a lot of time, grinding and effort into this one and it shows!
Surely I will follow and add some wonk in my buildinga
Alley name: the diagonal alley
grian build the Stewart little inspired house in your alley
Name Suggestion for the Ally        *Gally Way* The G-Ally Way
The galley get it grain and alley and it’s a word
if six shulkerboxes of deepslate is less im glad im not in hermitcraft
Need an animation of scar in the hole, call to all the talented ppl!!!
When I saw the thumbnail of Grian in the Boatem Hole and the dark void behind him, I just knew that he had fallen in again without having to read the name of the video
Sending scar a message  Gives me memmories of the mycelium resistance and the principal
to GRIAAAAAAN!!! you can call it boatem alley
20:12 THAT HELLO WAS SO DEPRESSED VVGBFBCGVFB
Ok, Hear me out. Call the alley... the Galley or G-Alley
He's scared scot
you should call it the griagonalley
Lag.
Grian's Boots:   "B O O T I E S"
You should send Scar a letter irl. Like what was done with the architects. He's a sucker for a story
6.9 mil lets go
I really enjoy your videos! There’s just something that I miss from last season, and it’s the music. The time lapse music to be precise. Consider changing it back for an adoring fan?
"these two are a little too straight so i added some wonk" a little too straight eh ;)
19:44   Wow grian we have the same name for the silk touch pic  "Silky"
Following with the Diagon-Alley pun: Dillyd-Alley (dillydally) Technic-Alley (technically) Whimsic-Alley (whimsically) Natur-Alley (naturally) Seismic-Alley (seismically) Erratic-Alley (erratically) Titanic-Alley (titanically) Coloss-Alley (collosally)
It should have been clear from the very beginning that the Boatem Hole is not at fault, but it's not foolproof, or Grian and Scar proof
I think a good name for the ally could be The Tilting Tunnel or Triple T for short! Since a few buildings tilt inwards and tilt to the side aswdll as it being a tunnel!
If I could join this server I would love to be your Deepslate miner
Call it Griagon Ally XD Or even Griangon Ally lol
Instead of diagon alley you should call is dia-mond alley
Name the Ally Way Grally
This might save you a while grian, but if you place the copper blocks with a one block space in between each copper block, they oxidize much, much faster. Love your videos, keep up the good work king!
petition to call the alley “blockturn alley”
I like how grian's defination of "only" is six shulker boxes
GRIAN NAME IT DIE-AGAIN ALLEY! (SINCE U BASED IT OFF DIAGON ALLEY AND SEASON 8 IS PUNS) (AND PUT A BUNCH OF TRAPS :D)
grian throwing enderpearls into the void in front of scar was incredibly funny to me
underpricing that deepslate... dont sell yourself short
Name the ally "g ally"
The Grally or Glane or Grain Lane or  Groad or  wonky woad/wonky road/wonky lane or  wonky roadway
Grian, the deepslate works out at 3.2 diamonds per stack to be equivalent to the diamonds you mined. I do math when you estimate. Edit: My name for your alley is Diag-onally
Griagon alley
that was the best power play in the history of minecraft <3
0:43 arm chair to moss chair
Names for the ally  -londen ally -wonk way Feel free to add your suggestion down below:)
Congrats on trending
Congrats on #3 on trending in gaming Grian!
He actually predicted he will build more wagon buildings when he placed the sign
i think this video is made before Mombo stole grians becon
why not name the alley Grian-gon Alley?
Thank you Grian😌😌
Just a reminder to like the video. Hermits work very hard to make these videos and it’s nice to feel appreciated💛🤍💛
the alley should be called griagon alley
Having a Boatum hole had turned Scar very murdery.    3rd life sure has changed a man.
does grian know bout techno?
Wonkllyway  Name for the alleyway
idea: maybe make a elytra circus but like everyone can join in and go through the circles and stuff!
Stop fooling around and show us some building progress !
OK. So if Grian has the G-Train this season. Does that mean next season it will be the G-Plane??
Grian: if I don't get something done by the time this oxidizes...the server will... Me: spontaneously combust? Grian:  ...result in an apocalypse Me: eh- same difference.
Grian:Losing everything Me: That botem hole oof
Hi Grian , so you might not know about that but Technoblade got diagnosed with cancer and it would really mean alot if you mention him in one of your videos . Love your content
name the alleyway Vertic Alley and name the bank Griangotts
You could call the alleyway the grain way Also the grain train sounds funny to me
I've said this before and I will say it again, it needs to be call Griagon Alley. (Grian + Diagon) ;)
i suggest you to put the name of the alley is Deepslate Alley
stap dying nub!!!!!!
I mean, you kinda deserved that after what you did to Scar
The boatem gods sure are demanding quite a lot of sacrifices
Diamond alley pronounced Di - uh- mond alley
Call the alley Griagon Alley! Or Grianon Alley!
cause everyone knows, it isn't about the money, its about sending a message.
Use haste potion
Thumb had no netherite gear
at the time of watching this grian has 6.9 million subscribers Lol
16 for a diamond
The amount of stuff they lose this season is just mind blowing
Idea: Flash deals. But random items in a cart and when they run out of stock, refill with other items!
Griangotts. It has to be. Everyone recomment this
Willy Wonka wonks the wonky ally with wonky grain.
162 stacks of deepslate/128 diamonds is ~1.27 diamonds per stack, yeah. Wow. You could do 3 stacks for 4 diamonds, that would mean 216 diamonds for the 162 stacks, instead of 324. Still a net profit of 88 diamonds, and may be a little easier to swallow for the other hermits?
Grians based should be call "the mountain of the galley way below" or the "Gallery way" like alley and gallery but with g and it looks like art
The alley need to be named as "Griagon Alley"
Get netherite armor and make a giant throne
"Crooked Crossway"  Is my name suggestion for the alley if your taking suggestions
Is no one gonna talk about the apocalypse thing he said or no😂
Grian: "Scar build HERE!!!"  Impluse: "NO! Scar build HERE!!!"  PearlescestMoon: "OI!! SCAR, MATE, BUDDY, PAL!! PLACE YOUR SWAG HERE!!"  Scar: Builds in all locations
u should buy a trident too
dont know what I would do without grian in hermitcraft
The reason a ton of comments have Grian as "Grain" is since it autocorrects into it, lol
Graingots should be the big building and laggin alley?  As a inside joke to this episode?
name of the ally way:barally way
9:35 especially since "wonk" is a smug (as in the kind of student) in American English
I love how grian fall scar in the void
Grian has either gone mad or is a genius to sell deep slate
hmm a decent name for the alley you say? how about descent alley
Griagon Alley
Only a million hours to get back your stuff? Those are rookie nembers
You should call it the Wonky Allyway
Did i just see a kreekcraft ad? Or what.....did kreekcraft pay for an ad or did someone did this??
grian's hermitcraft episodes are getting shorter and shorter
“ if i dont finish something by the time this oxidizes im going to start an apocalypse*  *season 6 and 7 flashbacks*
there has to be a door in botem hole
Vertical alley would be a good name instead of diagonally oh i mean diagon alley
Ngl putting the g train coming out of the cave sounds sick if you do it
AWESOME VID !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Scar of the bedrock hole, what is your wisdom?
S6: he gets scar to build the back of the mansion  S7: he gets scar to do the back of the terrain
The alleyway should be named the galleyway if you like it its ok
Grian you should name your alleyway The "Galley"
The die grian ally
Name the final bank/council hall Griangotts instead of gringgotts
You should build the building where you stayed at and add a little armorstand of you looking outside the window
Ah yes, I love adding wonk to my builds
Oh grian. Loosing all your stuff again.
Names for the ally  Wonkway Unnatural alley/alleyway
Look at my eyes grian not my diamonds
Scar needs to invest in some chorus fruit.
I mean, the end of the street has to be Griangotts right?
Name it vertic alley or horizont alley because it’s like diagon alley but… vertical or horizontal idk?!
Call it Vertic ally, because Diagon ally is meant to be Diagonally so Vertic ally would be Vertically.
Call the alley “The FinAlley”
A big bank in your alleyway? Would that be Griangott's by any chance??? ^o^
much facade
Can you incorporate Fred and George’s joke shop into your base? Just an idea
The grianally  Name for the ally way
Grain! forget the detail make the buildings then do the detail
Scar was in time out 😂
You should name the alley way the Galley way (G is for Grian) :)
wonkyalley
make a town hall
name the alleyway allie plss
Your going to regret the wonk if you try to put something in those buildings…
Grian CONGRATULATIONS! this video right now is trending for gaming #2
If he doesn't get the certain thing done before the copper oxidizes he is gonna start another war (I feel like he would do this on purpose)
You should name the alleyway the G-cave
Grian to get some inspiration look for “Caminito la boca, Argentina” Love what you do,  Regrats from Argentina
UnderVillage could be good name or CityGround pun there its underground and its a city 😅😅
Name for your base: The Unaligned Alley
did anyone else see the bedrock cracking from scar's punches at 15:09?
It's really weird but the new best of getting is not mining off camera but is selling of camera.
*Let's lose everything with the build master Grian!*
8:23 "decent name"  Pun. You meant to say "pun".
Griagon alley, or lagugon alley
Grian I swear if you don't make a bank at the back and name it "Griangotts" I will never forgive you.
Grainally
Grian’s Alley? GALLEY?¿?
Its black mail grian
Grian now has 6.9 million subscribers. Noice!!!
name it grally way --grain+ally way = grallyway
Why did they make this hole
Man, you should’ve named the trident TriDENT in my wallet
Diagrain Alley is looking fantastic! Lol
One thing I have learnt is that having villagers is very essential in Minecraft
"...I had a trident on me"  "oh no"
If grian makes a bank he should call it Griangotts instead of Gringotts
Why not just call the Alley, The Wonky Alley XD
botem-don ally (just an idea)
Boatem feeds again
"Sad barg noises" 😔
8:20 Dia-grian-alley

Rest of Minecraft player: so i mined diamonds off cam Grain: so i collected diamonds
Veric Alley
right after he killed that creeper....what happened?
name it city of ember like the book and movie
HOW ABOUT diagon ally thats a good name right? for the allyway
In fairness, Mumbo only "borrows" the beacon on occasion. In the "not asking, but if they doesn't know, it doesn't hurt em" sorta way.
"Griagonally" could be a name for the alley
You should actually implement a copper dam or wall into your base
ALLY CAVE
Nice Gaming video :)
So i was playing in a server in Minecraft and i had built a huge house that i like because i have never built so nice. The next thing i know is that my house was broken. Someone tnt-ed my house.
i this saw on another video, but you should name the alley way ‘griagon alley’
How about just call it underalley?
6.9M subs, nice
Grian: *Casually adds a little bit of WONK*
AGAIN!!!! GRIAN BE CAREFUL OTHERWISE U NEVER GONNA GET FULL NETHERITE MAN. Also the ally name could be Botem Ally
Boat Alley
Wonky ally Twisted ally Scar build here ally- Scar please build here ally-
Would think customs armor skins or the other hermits and random skins throughout the alley making to look like people are there would be super cool
Should call the alley “diagon alley”
Does anyone know Grian's villager timelapse song??
Mumbo would give you back to beacon anyways that's unfair that you keep the copper 😠
I’m telling you grian you could call it Wacky Alley cause of all the leaning buildings
"It was a joke!" ~ Grian
He needs to name that bank Griangotts
grain man is back on the trending page by killing himself in the block game
Mining diamonds would be better than mining the deep slate for the price you are selling it at? Supply and demand mate, capitalism. Prop up the price of the slate.
I feel bad for scar
You should call the alley, alley of inspiration
Petition to add a small gap between two buildings which leads to a small underground knocturn alley
The ally should be.called boatagon ally

Grian could make 2 houses based of of Maui and pearl.

Grian's "Aly way" more like new york houses
No giga base pls
You should make griangots
Grian for a idea for the name of the Allyway way what about Griagon Alley because even you said it was going to be like diagon alley
Name it the alley way The Galley Way ( Yes Ik that it Galley is also a boat but Grian alley way )
Grian pls listen to me, place each copper block a minimum of 4 blocks apart from another one, that way they oxidize faster
Grian:"Found diamonds"   Sb737:"DIAMONDS ARE FOR PEASANTS"  Goodness this hits me so hard😅
"Diagonal Ally" is a good name for your street...
Bro name it deepslate ally
2nd Time scar gonna do your back of the base?
You should make a mini barge in the alleyway
the hole really consume people
LOL, I'm glad you didn't come help me when I got lost in the nether. Scar was so precariously hilariously stuck. Seriously funny, but I think Scar's mountain will look good up there over your mountain. Grian, your work on the alley way looks phenomenal! Thank you for the laughter and the lovely video, all your hours of creating a happy time for so many people. <3
A graliway
“I’m going to have to replace all those items... again” Grian, grian, grian...😂
Music you should turn the alley into a shopping centre and call by gone Ali because people buy stuff from it
Name it the cave of life or the  craves of mystery's
‘’Down-tunnel abby”
today is my birthday:))
what if lag causes the copper dam to be waxed
You should also sell deepslate with the ores in it I know tango would buy it all up
"Grian's Grotto"   Keep up the great content 😀👍
That time-lapse music sparks such joy
Why do you trade with the villagers so much? Can’t you just craft your diamond armor, get like 100 levels at the ender bender, then trade and apply the books? I can’t imagine that it should take that many hours.
i was going to make anolth vid but i got to watch this
grally way
Update: groan has 6.9 million subscribers
The copper oxidizes faster when you separate it I think about 4 blocks away is best
copper oxidixes faster if sprread out
i feel like grian should make a deepslate mining service and charge more diamonds rather than trying to keep a back log of it.
The grind ally could be a nice name
YOU HAD A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TRI DENT IN MY POCKET
Scar was the one who jumped in her
Scar was the one who jumped in
When Grian was getting copper in inventory by lag I was getting techno vibes
A limited time offer train would be cool
Grian is so mischievous that I love it
He cut the part when he couldn't fly over the wool 😂
Grian : My diamonds are FLYING Me : You know, there is a person called Pearlecentmoon... (this is a joke, you will know this if you watch Pearl)
cavagon ally
Name idea g gon ally
Since the Grain is nearby, you should call it "The Gralley"
The buildings in the alley way looks like my teeth when I was small
A name for your alleyway Since the inspiration is from diagon-ally You can name it tangeti-ally
Wonk
:D
Scar-Help Im stuck Grian-hmmmmmm                   *NO NSFW*
This is not good to die in the void
Griagon Alley! It’s a no brainer…
you should name the alley Griagon alley
I think it would be funny if he called it Doorgone Alley. Like a pun to season 7 when  grian had to steel door's.
Hey Grian if you didn't put the burrow that would the biggest missed opportunity
Your at 6,9 mil subs btw. Almost at 7 mil
petition for grian to build a lake behind the copper dam
Hermitcraft: front of base no back of base me: back of base no front of base
I THINK YOU SHOULD NAME YOUR ALLEY WAY "THE DARK ALLEY WAY"..! (Remember the guy who bought 'minecraft from a guy in the dark alley way' from youtube shorts?)
# 3 on trending good job
Name it the galley because the g train or because grian
The galley way
GRIANGOTTS!!!!
Hermit craft season 6: futuristic modern cool aesthetic Hermit craft season 7: posh and rich applied with some jungle in there Hermit craft season 8: haha MOUNTAIN GO BRRRRRRRRRRR
Please call it Griagon Alley
"DiaGrian Alley" could be a potential name for the alley..
How about add a building above the road that's connected between the two buildings beside the road of your base.
I thought that scar said he wanted to build like a ufo or something this season?
"this looks suspiciously like a waterfall entrance" *Season 6 wars intensifies*
The boatem hole is pure CHAOS
He should call it verticaly (verti-caly)
I have a suggestion for the name of the alley   THE ALLEY OF SALLY
Grian now has 6.9 Million subs
I think grain started another war! Aka the sign for scar war
Grian bring back the best time lapse song (the one you used when ya built the interior of the upstairs of the mansion) challenge day 1
Scar: ‘one of the last times I’ve died in the last ten minutes…’  I hope he never changes xD
I feel like some giant floating islands would suit the gigabase very well
6.9 subs nice
GRIAGONALLY! NAME THE ALLY GRIAGONALLY!
If Scar had had rockets, he could have gotten out of the hole.
Hey grian, a gringotts bank sort of building would be nice for 'the big building in the back'.
Apart of breaking my neck/ oh no anyway
Instant karma
How about keep the empty buildings plain and sell them for the others to buy and build their own things?
A NAME FOR THE ALLEY = Grians Alley - GALLEY . XD
“It was….JUST A PRANK”
I’ve been waiting for this
Java’s Void you have to go down a little then come up slot.
For your ally you should name it diagon ally (idk if that's how you spell it) but with a pun in it
Dilly Dally Alley
When Grian and Scar get together, items and lives get lost.
Love the episode. But, hehe, do t try to act like the reason for having scar there isn’t so that he can build the back of that mountain (for ur cave)
All the hermits making and living in mountains are making and living in giant dirt houses but fancy with stone 😃
I thought of "Griagon Alley" instead of Diagon Alley, idk how good that is
not again XD,  season 6: War season Season 7: Shop keeper Season:8 Void killer
Grain lowkey getting annoying how are u going to tell Scar when and where to build so that it is convenient to you??
Hi
Name idea for the alleyway 'gally' or 'gallyway'
I'm still casting my vote for Die Again Alley xD Credit to the guy who first commented this idea
Hey Grian, I have come up with a name for the alleyway, Caveagonal Alley. I think it’s clever, but again maybe it can’t be sounded out. Hope you would consider.
but you don’t have a netherite pick
when it comes to pranks, grian is loki
Call the ally dieno (die no) alley
Grian copper oxodizes faster when they aren't placed together.
ally way name idea:  punagon ally
Name of the alleyway: the underGalley
Call it “Parallel Alley” or maybe “Paralley” (Para Alley?). Playing off of the diagonal in diagon alley
Name the alley the galley
Anyone heard from poultry man recently
18:09 that "oh no" got me good
me seeing the title: here we go again...
Name idea Dimension Alley
crookity alley
“Only 6 boxes of deep slate”
At least he didn’t have to worry about the curse of binding
Season 9 you make the barge and the G train but the barge is the train station how much money do you think you'll get out of that one
You should name the ally (gally) or the g ally
why don't  you guys just use vein mining mods
in the past ive made enchanting stations for my books. fill up chests with books for say a pick and then another for a sword and another for armor. orient them in a shulker and take loads of stuff to the enderman farm and combine them all there. still takes a while but with the right infrastructure you can multiply how efficient it is 10x. make 1 set of armor in an hour without it or 3 sets in 45 mins with the stations
Just name it "The Alley" and make a large sign in front of the entrance
"Wonky Alley" Could be a better name if you add a twist
Maybe you should take your becone back from mumbo
The second I saw grian broke the stone I knew what would happen
*WONK* Alley
I have name for alley boat alley (not good i know)
We all know grian chose this base design so he won't have to build the back side of the houses
Imagine Grian loses everyone's stuff next episode. We're in for some long time lapses of trading...
Grian, maybe you could try mine deepslate with a whiter. Pearl does that and it give lots of resources
Cav Urn Alley.
Name it diagrian alley
well thats sad
So the big building could be like your office for boatem inc stuff and the alley could be called hermits alley.
Quick idea: To maybe break up the buildings in the alleyway, build a small bridge right before the bank. You could add a ravine below that and do some of you amazing lighting.
Name the G - Train Stockwarts Express
I think "G-alley-leo" is a good name for the alleyway minus the dashes
Name the alley, "Vicolo." Try and find its meaning.
Call the alley way the grally way
Name the ally da-grianally
Grian you should call the alleyway - Diabolos. Pls like the comment so that Grian can see it
I really hope you do Gringotts Bank as the main centerpice. It makes the alley turn into a Y shape. Plus, it has a lot of wonk
Rename Boatem to Jezza. Then it will be Jezza’s back alley
At least neither of them had netherite lol
Where's is chicken man i miss him
grian ally
I really hope you do *Gringotts Bank* as the main centerpice. It makes the alley turn into a Y shape. Plus, it has a lot of *wonk*
please for the love of god call it diagonal alley
I feel like this won't be the only base this season, mainly because it's coming along so quickly
All I saw when Grian went after Scar into the hole, was 3rd Life all over again. :D You guys are awesome! <3
I got a name : soul street
Downtown Alley
Someone seriously needs to make an animated series of all the shenanigans and misshaps caused by the boatem hole XD
How about name your base Ginnel (for people who don't know it is a word for a narrow passageway between buildings) but add your name to it so it would be called "Griannel"
What about calling the alleyway "The Crooked Mile" ?
Take a Walk Down Wonk St.
Alley name: g-gone-alley (Dia-gone-alley) lol
Idea what to name the Alley: The Galley.
Call the allyway Griangotts
Gally way
Grian at the end of the cave add a gringotts bank.
The tunnel could be called the wonka tunnel🤔
The name could be literally Liter alley which literally means literally.
You should call it the “Gali” Ali with the g for Grian
The unnamed alleyway... My brain is like Galley xD Btw gully means alleyway in Hindi and galley sounds like it xD may work lol
Chaos caverns for allevay
Deepslate is tuff to get....😆😆

Grian : *‘I think scar wants to build a mountain’*   Scar :  *S K Y  C I T Y*
Grian:HAHHAHAHAHA i am trolling scar *he meses up" Also Grian:OHHHHH NO
grian if you wanted an idea for your alleyway, you should put hanging houses on the walls above the houses in the alleyway. it will look cool and make it look magical if you decorate it like if a fairy lived there
Name idea: crooked corner or crooked korner
Grian: _complains about how slow mining deepslate with an efficiency 5 diamond pickaxe and a haste 2 beacon_ Me: _looks sadly at my iron pickaxe_
I know how scar feals on my realm i have died 6 times with full netherite armor and hotten it back and elytras and full nethite tools.
GRIANgotts, do it!!!
Is anyone gonna comment on the fact that Grian finally turned off caps loc in the title?

You should call your Allie Grallie
The Valley Alley(way)!
Gg grian
i legitimately cried from laughter this episode 🤣😂😭😭🤣😂
should have put a sign above scar and advertized him like boatem hole zoo
I love how Grian is making scar do *the back* for him.
Grian spelling "Scar build here!!!," has made me very OCD. Would it have been so hard to build a comma?
That copper wall costs $85627.80
Hermitalley
Oh no, you missed the pun. with naming the helmet. Instead of Helmie, could of been Hermie.
Name ur build Dragon Keep
GRIAN PLSSSE NAME IT THE SPLIT PLSSSSSSSSSSS i just thout of it lol❤️❤️❤️❤️

Every time when grian always  go to the boat and hole Brian always dies in the void

Ok now everybody let’s get this comment pinned I think the alley should be called “Grians-best-day-alley-way” I think this fits the name very well
I think you should call the ally way (The Shady Ridge) for all the different shades used in it
You can name the build Diagrain alley and the train can be changed to hermitcraft express
I cannot WAIT to see Grian-gott's Bank!
14:32 how he looks LMAO
10:37 Grian has started a war ………….. again
I love the time-lapse music so much
16:04 that was a terrifying laugh.     *I love it.*
Grian: for the diamonds Me: thinx about grian waiting for eight days practicing saying “for the diamonds”
Scar didn’t push Grian into the hole. It was lag

6.9 million nice
#1 on trending nice!
I think a good name would be horizontal ally
Fun fact: You are reading this comment because it start's with the fun fact.
you should name it the ally-oop XD
Grian you need to space out the copper because  oxidation will happen quicker when spaced out rather then ut being together
blue windows on the black building might give it a pop of color while still remaining dark! 😊
Barges, Trains... What's next... Planes? Oh no...
I love your videos!
By the end of this season Grian's titles are going to be "LOSING EVERYTHING (again) (again) (again) (again) (again) (again) (again) (again) (again) (again) (again) (again) (again) (again)"

Congrats on 6.9 mill !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        nice
The Galley Alley
I have been building a mansion out of deep slate and I actually find it pretty fun getting it.
“I have to activate my two brain cells” ah yes, the holy two brain cells lmao
Hmmmmmmmmm shag 🧐🧐🧐 10:43
Tat man and Waffle boy
Grian + Ally  The Grally!
Y’all seriously need to shut the hole
When grian fails to do something before the damn oxidizes he starts another war
Diamondgon Alley
You should call it The Galley. Grian + Alley = Galley.
6.9 subs Coolio also *Have some wool*
6.9 million subscribers      Nice...
Grigon alley
19:21 by the end of that time-lapse the screen looks stretched to the right...
I think it could be called the Galley way. He's already made the G-train (I call it the Grain system) so why not
Pleeeeease
C’mon Digrian Alley!!
The Ally Valley?
Fr
I bet Grian's alleyway looks really good during nighttime. I wish to see it in a future episode.
Oh man, here we go again.
i love the creeper lookin at the shop(7:45) and try's buying it XD
16:00 trying to convince scar.  17:00 IT’s KARMA TIME. No Grian. Death time!
grian pls name the bank gringotts
“Added a bit of wonk”… sounds dumb but why do I know exactly what your talkin about LoL 😂  Also “Ahhh laggg”!
Ngl, the front of the g-train is looking pretty sustainable
"we are goint to send a message to scar" *War flashbacks*
Name your alley the "Galley"
"This was too straight, so I added a bit of wonk" God creating me
Grian: where the big bank or something is gonna be.  Every potterhead: GRINGOTTS!
Mombo took your beacon
Griagon alleyyyyyyyyyy
“I hate building in diagonal alley” little okay on diagon ally

On the plus side, scar IS building in grian’s selected spot :)
Alabaster Allie should be what you call it
5:38 u litery made a cave man made wow

Grian: *Dies* Scar: First time?
“Only six shulker boxes of deepslate” I’m sorry Grian but is this bad? MY MAN! That is a lot of deepslate
Call your Bass the gally way
Hey Grian for your base inside name how about Crooked Cavern?
But y
grian name it the g spot
Wow only 8 hours ago uploaded and the views are already at 1.2mil
"I zigged when i shoulda zagged" laughed so hard
Grian you're the best creator amongst the hermits, but if I might offer up a little criticism, your previous season's designs were far more grand and detailed.  These storefronts, to be brutally honest, look more like candy coated children's toys, as opposed to Potter inspired alley storefronts.  It's not your artistic ability that's at fault, it's the unfortunate scale you decided to built at.  If you went 1 size larger, you could have been able to add real detail and realism to them.  As it stands, they come off more as blocky and lego-esq.  Hope it helps, keep up the great work.
For the ally what about the name griangotts
WE GOT A NEW WAR BOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hmm why don’t I fly into the void and thrown all my fireworks that’s a amazing plan
Haha WONK
15:08 wtf why was the bedrock breaking?
It's great when your favorite peace, friendly, relaxing voice youtuber uploads
It had to happen on episode 13 of all numbers.
If mumbo is batman, make the street crime alley
Grian remember The Barge in season 7 that was a diamond generator.😁😁😁
is that bedrock being broken or em i seeing things 15:05
Grain thank you for blessing me when you upload
Well if the alleyway is a location where people can stock up on everything they need, especially after they die... why not name it Die Again? Alley-
“ I have to activate my two brain cells to remember how to spell things”      o k
Dia-grian alley
I think the Alley name should be called the Wonky Walley
When you said bank all I thought about was Griangotts bank. I want to see this happen.
Name the alleyway Griagon alley
Name for "The Alley"   Could be called "The Galley" G for Grian lol
Number 1 trending video on YouTube, congratulations!
Why does it say shag 😂
Thanks Grian for keeping us entertained!
Scar is just so sweet :3
I think scar build should be on giga base just connect it and have a giant entrance to all boatempole
I feel like “For the diamonds!” Should be the hermitcraft motto
“Mine-on alley” cuz u gotta continually mine n stuff ig
grian idk if you will see this but you should have a cart for the g train as like a item shop where they are there but gone after a certain amount of time
Its the anonymous alleyway
You should add a victim/sacrifice count to the boatem hole
Grian should suggest a server wide “Lag Day”, where everyone can be as laggy as they want to be.
Boatem hole: the eater of worlds!
At the back of the cave thing the bank should be super futuristic and you could call it "Bank to the Future"
*nice* sub count
#3 treading on gaming let's goooo
He should call it diagrain ally
16:41 the most heroic sacrifice to ever grace youtube
6.9 million subs, a bit sus
Griagon Alley is really coming together
Watch the dam actually out run him and he makes a post apoc event.
You should make a platform 9 and 3/4 area for the brick entrance to the alley but going in the opposite direction, for like VIP shopping area use a picture that has the texture of brick to give the illusion like you walk through a wall
I don't want to sound the wrong way, but I think you have all built 3 separate mountains as opposed to one unified range with a consistent style. It might be good to remake your mountain a bit, at the very least some reshaping might be necessary.
Griagon alley?
Should name the alley something like mountainville alley
Karma
Stick with what works! “Galley” for the alley name
call it the calley  cave+alley
kind of sounds like the first person to make a tnt tunnel bore to mine deep slate is gonna make quite a bit of dosh.
The Alley. It has a nice ring to it.
Hold on.. you can name the ally griagon ally
Try wonk ally plss ☻
"Helmie" is my name....
grians subscribers are nice
Name idea: Awkward Alley Or: Wonky Way
I was waiting for  this and  I was watching 3rd live
tbh you got karma
Grian alley or Boatem alley. Said quickly, like diagon alley.
I can see the biggest smirk on Scars face 18:17
U should name the alley the gralley
Alleyway names ideas :  The Galley/The Galleyway: it lines up with the putting G in front of structures like the G-train The Great Galley: a variation  Or the great Galleyway The Galley under the mountain The Great Grian Alleyway  The DiaGrian Alley (Batmangamer) The Big Boatem Alley
The Galley?
You should call the bank griangots
I keep calling the alley the Gralley (Grian Alley)
Boys let’s get “The Alleyway” renamed to “The Narrows”  It’s just objectively cooler
Should call the ally boatem ally as the “hole” is kinda boat shaped
Your base could be named diagonally
Name of alley : Noback Alley
Hear me out… name for the alley should be Horizontal Alley
Grain said to a creeper “we don’t allow window shoping” but creepers cant see windows. Lmao 😂
I hope there's a tally at the end of the season of all the gear the boatem hole has eaten
OMG NUMBER TWO ON TRENDING LETS GOOO GRAINNNN❤️❤️😁 and maybe you should name the alley “da’grian alley”
Hello, I was thinking since grian has the egg, what if he names the Alley Dragon Alley, and in front of the bank display the egg on like, a fountain or something.
Why dont you call it the Grian Gully :)
The boatem hole is going to be the richest member of the server
Lol most of them are building mountains. It's  no longer Boatem; it's Mountain...em?? Mountem? Lol whatever it is.
"Tri can't believe you made me buy this"  ME who goes by tri and also can't believe scar made him do that
Perhaps you should’ve made maps to see how the Boatem Village progressed throughout the season. Just sayin’
Any idea of when season two of third life is coming
Ally name: GRIAGON ALLY
"WoNk" Ugh LOVE it grian
On the bright side scar does not have the cat head stuck on him
You should name it either: Diagrian alley or Griagon alley.
"The Wonk Alley"
Ok ok hear me out "Grains Grotto" thoughts
Will all your mountains have your faces on them, mount hermitmore, that is all I am going to say
You should do a vault at the back of the base
I know I’ve seen it from someone else, but since the base is taking inspiration from diagon alley, you could call it horizont alley.
Name idea for the alley: Griton Street
gally way wonky way
"Now these two were just a little too straight, so I added a little bit of wonk" I hope this gets blown out of perspective
How easily scar is spooked for some reason brings joy to everyone on the sever.
It should be a courthouse
Grian you put that hole there. Seems like Karma is stalking you.  LOL
the gally way
I'd love if he called the alley Whimsic. You know, Whimsic Alley...Whimsically!
Origin Alley, Originally Mystic Alley, Mystically Dillyd Alley, Dillydally
You should name the ally way “downton boatam”
scars doing a cloud base, gl with that back of the mountain though :)
The galley way
the galley way
Almost at 7mill
Grain you should sell diorite in big batches like 1 diamond for 2-3 stacks bc iskall would buy it just to burn it
Diagon alley -> diagonally  So later alley -> laterally ? (Because it’s not diagonal? Eh? Eh??)
Call the alley "grainstock alley"
Name for alley way G alley
Scar will end up making an epic structure, stealing the spotlight from the others.
Scar: Help me step bro! I’m stuck!
Spruce trap doors for the sides if the coal cart!!
Season 7 barge season 8 train season 9 bus
RIP Grian because of deep slate 🥲
Botem is moutain guys bruhh and if you dont rll want to mine deepslate do limited édition
You could made the alley some kind of pun or put boatem or maybe you could make the copper park of the alley and name it oxide alley or something like that
I just made up a name for the alley  HERMIGON ALLEY
Grain have two side 1.normal red grian who cares about something he do 2.little bad grain laughing after doing something
Grian should call the ally way, the "Gally way" or "The Gally" :] its not creative but mehh.
Call the bank in the middle 'Griangotts' 🙂
I love the friendship between Grian and Scar 🤣😁
Name Suggestion for the base: The Forgotten Allyway (sorry for spelling)
how about the back rally?
Me: watching Grian Grian: Has 6.9 Million subs Me: Nice
The lag missed some iron 😂
Maybe “Alley Valley” for the alley way?
Only old viewers still remember grian swearing
Hi
Vertical Alley
You should name it griangonally
Name it the “Wonk Way”
You should name the alleyway grianalley cuz like diagonally.
You should call the alleyway diagon vally
You should name the valley grians grove
Call the alleyway something that spins off of Diagon Alley. For all the potterheads  please
Grian with the copper dam is the equivalent of going for a run and thinking "If I don't reach that tree before that car, I'm gonna die."
Dragons den alley?
Grian owns the best shop every season
Grian : *spleefs scar* HAHAHAHAAHAH! Scar : oh Grian I don't actually have rockets OH NOOOOOO Grian : I've won, but at what cost?
Karma, hahahah
the hole consumes all things grian
Grian plus village = Grillage
Ally of no back
Name the alley "G-Topia"!!!!
i dont want to do it, BUT ILL DO IT FOR THE DIAMONDS
The Steam Alley, because of the G-train
I just notice that he's technically falling up in the thumbnail
wonk [wäNGk] NOUN NORTH AMERICAN informal a person who takes an enthusiastic or excessive interest in the specialized details of a particular subject or field, especially political policy.
Name for the alley: DyeABirb alley, because birb poultry and you cant dye a pesky birb in a traditional way
It's "Letting Scar deal with the back of the mansion" all over again, isn't it?
I think Scar should have a sky island
should call the alley way grain way
Grian: “Look how slow this is” Me with my trusty unenchanted iron pickaxe: “but that’s speed”
Did he just INSULT the Barge
you should put the inspiration next to the building during the timelapse.
How about the “Tally way” for the alley way’s name?
griagon ally
I think there is a huge opportunity being missed by not having the G-train be the hogwarts express.
You could name the Alley way Ash Cat Ally as Ash cat is slang for firemen
Idea don’t die
I still think the idea someone else came up with Griagon alley and  Griangotts would be brilliant
Name it gallyway
Now is the time to change name "Did you parished?" Parcel To "Did ur prank gone wrong?" Box
How about you call the ally wonk ally because it’s diegon ally with wonk in it
Or… KATYWONKUS ALLY.  Bc Grian loves cats and wonk, and ally’s.  Instead of catywhompus which kind of means diagonal, like diagon-ally
W O N K
How about "Wonky Way" or "The Wonderous Wonky Walk Way"
6.9m sub? Nice
Wonk
Lo 6.9 mil lol
The alleys coming along, its so cute!
Grian, if you want music composed I can compose some music for you.
WONK ALLY!  Also fits with Impulses’ Wonka factory.
Scar: likes to overthink The boatem: remedies it by making scar choose where to settle
How abt calling the it "the cliffcave alleyway" uncreative but has a nice ring to it
Fun fact: wonk is a word used to describe hard working people (from the dictionary)
How about a reverse auction (Grian give a dimond block to who ever gives him the most valuble item(dimonds not allowed) )
Grian ,have you check out TrixyBlox ?He's a pretty good builder :D
Feel like something related to "Diagonally" has to pop up for the name
Always carry a water bucket.
Grian, Deepslate is mined slightly faster with a gold pickaxe than with a netherite one.  It might just be worthwhile to put Efficiency V onto a gold pickaxe to attempt to instamine Deepslate.
Wow Grian! The content you create blows me away every time!  Scar: 0 Those two mischievous brain cells: 238 (I have “definitely” been counting)
My day is made when grian uploaded a new episode.
You know that "Heonk heonk heonk" laughing older gentleman?  Why do I feel like that's Grian's laugh slowed down a bit
My day is made when grian uploaded a new episode.
or maybe "Vertic-ally"
10:42 so pearl wanna shag scar?
The deep slate tile blocks are pretty sweet
You should name the ally “Grian’s Gully”
You likely will not see this, but hopefully you do! Name for the ally: Boatem Way
call the ally the "Horizant-ally"
the minecraft building was better than the real life building
You need way less cheerful music when mining deep slate. Also, make an actual coal hopper for the train.
Good gosh, they need to change something about deepslate. I'd love to use it more but I'd rather just use Blackstone because of the time investment.
18:39 they swore on the hole
When this seasons war eventually starts, you’re going to hear rallying cries of “For the diamonds!”
At the end of the alley you should have Griangots
Still call it the unnamed alleyway I think its a good name
Netherite Efficiency 5 with Haste 2 absolutely SHOULD be able to insta-mine deepslate. For players that like creating huge things, the utility of deepslates color palates are so helpful, and being able to get it more easily with END GAME gear sounds reasonable to me.
I hope Scar build elsewhere.  Brian, your ass isn’t allowed to make any comments about the back of bases
The fancy hooked 'a' in Scar's name made me so happy.
20:56 there's 2 crosshairs on scar's face
I get the feeling Elybeatmaker is gonna make a remix of Grian saying “add some wonk”
u should name the alley Wonk Alley or smth 🥴
xB would be delighted, you’re selling deepslate. I LOVE the alley! <3
Need a name for the Alley? Name it Griangon Alley. It's basically Diagon Alley but slapped Grian on it.
The G-Ally name idea
Y
At the end of the alley it should be the boatem hq.
Name your ally “diamond ally” referencing how rich your convenience stores make you lol.
Grian upload on my bday yay support from philiphines
The gway
Grian is not a subtle creature. Ominous yes, concerning yes, subtle no. And that's why we love him.
6.9 million subs, amazing lol
The mountown
You should look up words that end with “ally” and find a word that you can split in half to make a cool alley name like jk Rowling did with the word diagonally.
call the alley the Galley
Grian you should call the alley: The Grion Alley
Name the ally "digrian ally" or something on the lines of that
Direction-Ally? like an off brand diagon-ally
GRIAN!!! If you should build a bank but instead of Greengots you should name it Griangots!!! P.S. ignore the spelling
You should call your base DiaGrian alley
GRIAN NAME THE ALLEY "WONKY WAY"  I think it would be a good name sorry for the caps jist needed people to see yhis
Tbh your mountain sucks in between mumbos and pearls mountain
the new buildings are like peanut butter and jelly ahahahah :D
14:32 Saved it for myself  Feel free to see if you like it too
Fun words that end in -ally... Octagonally Fanatically Technically Archaically Satirically Erratically Etc.  Personally, while it's not funny on the surface, Linguistic Alley could work, considering the amount of wordplay in the botem village.
Me thinking about scar's big hat: NOOOO   scar with no hat isn't the same with scar with big hat/lil hat AHAHAHAHA
Could call it, "the backless ally" and just never do the back of the buildings
Episode 100 - "Alley way is finished!!"
Call the alleyway: Downton alley
13:57 *here we see a grian getting angry*
Name for the ally way can be “reville” for revine and a village
it was lag
If that bank isn’t called grain-gotts I stg
the "SCAR!!" at 13:57 was said in such a dramatic way i swear it was like watching Mufasa fall
15:16 I have been trying to reach you about your car’s extended warranty
“Griagone ally” please consider the name
6.9 subs HAHA NICEE
Maybe GRIANALLY😇
G-alley
You and Scar both losing everything was hilarious!  🤣😂  The Alley is looking gorgeous!
rip stuff
straight up sell deepsslate for 5 diamonds per stack because that's how much it is worth
How about the alleyway is called New York Potter Avenue
Who else thought that Scar saying Those are just the things in the fine print that we never read was kinda scary
Instead of Diagon Alley it should be Horizont Alley
The coper laged into grians inventory
Grian 69mil subs
I can already tell that Grian is goin to be the richest hermit
Did you die? And are you tired of grinding again.  Then buy our product For 1 1/2 stacks of diamonds
the buildings are all slanted, so how about (diagon)al alley?
6.9 mil subs nice.
Should name the alleyway "Boatem Boulevard" 🤷‍♂️
Downdend Alley?
G-Alley or Galley
The alleyway needs to be named: The G-alley  you can even build a galley dock out the back
Call your base the crooked crevice, this is gonna get buried
Donda is out
Come on name the bank "griangotts" it's perfect.
:(
Plz can u call ur base diorite alley or diamond grian alley
The horizon ally Horizontally? No?
The alley should be called  Unusualley, kinda like an unusual alley !
That outro made me thought you died again 22:27
You should name a building Griangots after Gringgots.
ONLY 6 shocker boxes full of deep slate
Call it the Ambient Alleyway
Grian should name the alley Horizont alley.
I don't think I'm allowed to make jokes about the back of bases _Flashbacks to the Season 7 Mansion_
6.9 million subs congratulations
"If i dont get something done by the time its oxidized, the server will result in apocalypse"  another grian war right around the corner I can smell it.
grian we need to see the finished product in shaders
grian is hermitcraft's elon musk
I normally like you video bc the commentary, builds or you skeeming. This time was for the scar interrogation
Oh geeze. The entire boatem hole exchange had me so anxious bc I knew the title was happening. And then... it happened.
Alley names  Leg Alley Horizant alley Craz Alley Fact alley Fantastic Alley (Hermit)Craft Alley  Add more in here and have fun with them. Just make them puns
I personally think that u don’t even need to come up with a better name. “The Alley Way” is a perfect name.   All in favour of keeping it “The Alley Way”       |       |      V
rip grains stuff
call it the g alley or the galley way or something
You should make a place in the alleyway called olivanders and have villagers that sell sticks
vertic ally
Hi
14:40 Saiki Kusuo is that you in grian form
You should name it Griagon Alley
guys grian is on 6.9M "nice"
Life is great when Grian farms deepslate :)
Make a bank and call it Griangotts
Stable video 👍
2:55 did Grian swear?
I recently fought the wither underground and after beating it there was so much stuff laying around, including Deep Slate. So maybe you could try summoning the wither and actually letting it go ham for a bit while you dip in and out. If possible you could try trading it and letting it auto mine around itself too
you should name the alley: "Wherehascavesandcliffsgon Alley"
does he mean gringots bank?  edit: how does the Gallery or Galley sound, they actually exist, ask google.
I think It should be named not so strait backstreet (totally not a diagon alley ripoff)
STOP RECARATING DIAGON ALLEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Grian: we need to send a message  me: so a wooden sign  Grian: we are going to build in giant letters scar build here
Grian's Hermitcraft word of the day: *WONK*
When Gman said I am going to stock DEEPSLATE I actually said F
I just realized something, their in-game shops indirectly pay them real money.  They make money off of YouTube as it is their career...  So them recording all this business stuff in a video game is making them real bucks.
Grian Hi, You can Insta mine deep slate with a Netherite Pick ax
Bro Scar in the bedrock has serious Cask of Amontillado vibes rn
Name for the alley, Wonkey Way
I love the music in the timelaps
Ahyess two of my fav YouTubers posted at the same time
What is your wisdom Scar of the Bedrock?   Scar: I'm building the base on your place but I'm also gonna bring you to death 🤣
Since there is "Ollivander's " in the alley,  it only feels right to call it Dia-gone alley
okay soo, hear me out, Imagine you build a tavern inside the alley where you sell potions, and then you can call the alley the talley alley, for tavern alley
Make gringorts
You should make a huge hall for the boatom crew can have meetings or you could make it so all the bases connect underground and they meet there.
Name suggestion for the alley: DiaGRIAN Alley
cobbleslow slate vally (puns)
You should add villager stalls to the alley
“The Back Alley” is a good name not much of a change but it fits
8:20 *The "Qui-Gon Alley"*  .*Gets sued by: J. K. Rowling, Lucasfilm, Warner Brothers, NBCUniversal and Disney*. :D
Tbh grian I don't think this is much of a megabase. I hope you step up a bit because this is starting to look like bdubs's town without the mountain
Grian you should do a clock tower at the end of the alleyway, a big one like big ben, but with a substantial amount of wonk.
GRIAN DID A PUN AGAIN 13:36 *hole*d on
Diamond-Gone Alley
the council has awarded you a singuar yike
make the G train go through a nether portal and just teleport it in the middle of some bases that is what I would call some advertisement
Name your new base the g-cave  + might might want to get netherite   Love the vids keep n going ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
He should call it diagonal alley
The Alleyway should be called Horrib Alley since it sounds like Horribly and Diagon Alley sounds like Diagonally. Also it's a pun so it fits with this season.  My ideas are HORRIB ALLEY bad  Hhhhahhahahahaahahahahahahaaaaaa...
How about calling it Doolally Alley?
Grian you should name your base clifford alley
Speaking of overthinking things. Mailman’s send messages. You placed one.        (It’s not mailmen, we don’t call ourselves humens do we?)
Season 8: hermits playing in the void 😂
The deep slate car should change overtime and be different unique blocks every time it sells out ps. I really like the time lapse music and also WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNKKKKK
you could name the base Ravine Road
Wonk alley, there’s your name
scar definitely has adhd symptoms and gets really into minecraft so Im not surprised he makes such large builds
Instant karma Grian next lesson do no spleif anyone XD
Name for the alley Hollows hall-a-way
Gigagon alley
Gri(a)ngotts bank should be in the center of the base.
Alley name suggest digrian alley
The arches alley
Hear me out.. botem alley
*Grian trying to sell deepslate* Deepslate: im'ma be a tanky boi
Alleyway griande
"Won't have to do the back of the terrain"  flashbacks to not finishing the back of the mansion
Scar is so trigger happy 😂
The G Avenue
heellllooo karma
"this copper that ive been slowly building up" you mean the copper that strangely and quickly lagged into your furnace.
please stop zooming in so much, it's often unnecessary and zooms in too far.
Hey grian can you play pixelmon???
you should name your mega base the train alley
Ah yes, W O N K
Grian reminds me of Mufasa from Lion King everytime he yells "SCAR!"
16:07 WHAT AN EVIL, MANIACAL GREMLIN LAUGH I CAN'T-
alley way name suggestion- Diagrian Alley
Scar needs to build a big cloud that starts from the copper wall that you had and goes all the way to impulseSV's base and it is hovering over the top of the builds  like if you agree ☁ ☁ ☁
Someone said on another video make your base ‘The Grambles’ because the Shambles and Grian
grian we need the old time lapse music back
I'm 100% sure someone suggested it already. But why not name it vertic-alley. (Because it stoops downwards into the mountain)
Boatem Valley
Grian to get deepslate just make a tunnel bore there are some easy to make designs and you get get tons real quick
Diagrain Alley, just putting it out there
It should be called griangon alley
MORE WONK
Its seems like its on the "Back of the Mansion" meme again but its behind the giant cave/cliff
The fact that these people can have fun, and get money, by just playing Minecraft,  blows my mind.       Keep doing what you’re doing grain.  We love you
The alley should be named DiaGRIAN Alley
12:34     I got triggered after watching grian's super smelter
ALMOST 6 MILLION
bygone alley
Goddammit Grian you had one job
I fill like the ally should be called boatum-ally
This has 1 million views, damn, the most views I've had a video is 10,000 views 👏
Nooooooooo the hat 😭😭😭😭😭
You should start a diamond loan shop, where other hermits can take diamonds, but they owe you more diamonds next season
3:09
wp on mcc
WONK WONK WONK
How About " Cueva De Grian "? ( A Name For The Alleyway )
Call the alley Griagon Alley
Grain? Green? Greyan?
Why not a mining/ore carriage for the deeps late?
You should totally do Weasly's Wizard Wheezes
My idea for your mega base name is backstreet
And the train remind me of the Hogwarts express
Grian asking scar if the cat head had curse of binding and scar saying no, checking, and then a quiet "dangit" can be heard is the funniest thing I've seen in all day
Grian you can insta-mine with haste 2 efficiency 5 and a netherire pic
so far boater incorporated has had to replace 3 sets of armour, mumbo, scar and grian now lol
You am smart
The end building should be a bank with villagers to trade with and a beacon for the roof
All I an going to say is  Griangon ally
Step-scar
Griagon ally. There’s ur name
Plug up the damn holee
You should call your base the Diagrian Ally
19:04 Best busy work music.
Deepslate diamonds look so good
Name the Alley, Griagonn Alley
I was just thinking you should call it the rallyway as a mix between railway and alley.
name the alley the gralley
YOU SHOULD NAME IT WONKY WAY
You should totally name the alley "Diagrian Alley"!!!
Karma
Name for your allyway...Grian's Alley...The Gralley!
You could definitely name the alley with a pun in it, maybe "Psycho Path"
The underground alley
i have an idea for the alley way its called the g alley for grain alley
Gria-gon alley? No?
Name of the alley should be the unknown Ally
You would think people wouldn’t be hanging out right next to the giant death hole but it’s caused so many deaths XD
lol grian is dum for minenig the blocks
画质感人
Didn’t Scar say he was going to build a sky city early on based on Bioshock Infinite, which would be insane. That wouldn’t help the back of your base Grian.
call let the grian cety
possible name for the ally: boatum grally   grally= grian and ally   just a possibility
Grian name it Tight Town good name for ur base ｡◕‿◕｡
Call it Griagon Alley
Diagon alley is a play on diagonally. You should call your street Horizon tally. Both are line names and it expands into the horizon.
the galley
It's The Half and Half Alleyway
Grian, it would be cool if you made the bank then have a huge underground cave with a dragon and a Minecart rollercoaster like in the movies
Grian and Scar together are the funniest!!!
Can't wait to see the "Galley-Oop" (yes that's a name suggestion) complete in and out ^u^
The fact that Grian is just blackmailing scar into building the back for him makes me feels like we have found a new side of him the shouldn’t even be seen
Make a bank called Griangotts
Grian you need to place all the copper blocks separately to make it more faster to oxidize
"I'm just gonna add some *wonk* to my build"  Grian (quote of the video) XDDDD
Dude, nice!
When I see the title I was like “noooooooooooo”
goodtimewithscar fell out of the world grian fell out of the world sounds like gg
I rather feel that Boatem should never bother upgrading to netherite this season. It's just not worth it.
Only 6 shulker boxes
The G-WAY
Bro j cover the boatem hole w black wool and when u need to sacrifice open it up
you should totally call the ally the G-ally(said Gally)
Can we please blow this comment up so that Grian will put half mansion  in the ally
I love how Scar just gets stuck in the weirdest ways 😂
a name idea could be griagon alley like how ur inspo is diagon alley sorta :] pronounced gr-eye-uh-gon or jus how it looks gria-gon
The wonks are off the charts
Me: **Watching Grian** No one: ... Literally no one: ... Me: OH MY GOD THE G-TRAIN IS THE HOGWARTZ EXPRESS
That black building and that pink building next to each other look like that meme about your Spotify playlist
Wonk alley
Technically when you knocked scar down the boatem hole it was revenge for when he did the same destroying you netherite armour
the gally way
If ever two knuckleheads deserved each other, it would be these eedjits.
If he chooses to make the bank he should call it Grian-gotts
Grain you should the alleyway grains greenery
THE G TOWN
What is it with things named scar and pushing people into holes
Copperdam Alley would actually be a really cool name
Does he not make a backup set in case he dies
Daaaaam #2 on trending 1 mil in 6 hours congratulations 🎉
Please add Fred's and George's joke shop, or something that look like it in the alley
Scar kills Grian, but grian cant seem to kill scar though
You need a better hobby than losing your stuff

" Tri can't believe you've done this" was right there

Scar: Building a HUGE starter base  Me: Building a dirt house "that's good"
Grain: doesn’t that have curse of binding? Scar: no, not… dang it
Hey Grian, a cool name for your alleyway would be the Underneath.
Name the alley griagon valley!!
You should name the alley Griadon Alley
The Gally?
you should name the alley the g alley
You should call the alley, Chest minster alley
Be careful?
Valley Alley is what I call it.
Broom shop.
what you gunna do with karalis adict
Make gringots
6 hours ago and already a million views, wow
I like how Grian is just casually ignoring the diamonds in the deepslate like it's no big deal.      As a total aside, I notice that Grian has 6.9mil subs and that is very _nice_
I have an idea for the shops! Have the g train run around a main area where you build them all
How about you call the alleyway “Grianon Alley”.
You should name it Steampunk Street
aw this comment lagged
Call the alley Diagon Alley and make a Bunk to the back name it Gringots
“ONLY” 6 shuckers of deepslate
Grian has 6.9 million subs, noice
Call the gigabase the "MOUNT BOATEM POLYMPUS"
You should name your cave of shops "the g-spot"
Grian should definitely name the alleyway Griagon Ally. It’s like Grian and Diagon Ally smashed together.
To be honest "The unnamed alleyway" is actually a good name for the alleyway.
I say you make for main part of the house the bank
Dia-grian alley
Griangotts!!
You should make a leaning house and a house wedged between them
8:24  G-way
Griangotts
Why does it look Scar is partially breaking bedrock he's under?  🤔🤔🤔  14:59
Call it the Deepslate Alley, it's simple but makes sense because that's what the road is made from
this may or may not be a stupid name for the ally but what about griagon ally
We’ve been telling you to call it GRIAGON ALLEY for going on a month now!!
The Halle Berry!!!
the alleyway coild be called the "You're-a-wizard-HAlley"
What about the Grally The G-Ally if you will
#2 on Trending for gaming
#1 on trending in canada :D
you should leave a gap (like one block wide) between two of your buildings, as like an alley-within-an-alley, that leads to a dimly-lit back room for shady dealings
You can hear the genuine pain in Grian's voice when he died. Something broke in me then :(
"look how slow this is" me checking if its at 2x speed
Fun fact: Mumbo is like 2 episodes ahead of you.
The GrianGon alley? (Or the mumboafk ally)
How about calling your alley as Galley G-Alley Sounds like a gully
Hey Grian! Probably won’t see this since I’m a bit late but maybe an idea for the “roof” / top of the mountain is like what “buried” looks like from black ops 2 zombies just a thought
So, you know how Diagon Ally is just a play on the word diagonally? And how Knockturn Ally is a play on the word nocturnally? Well, what if you name the cave Vertic Ally? A play on vertically.
This hole has caused nothing but trouble
Name it the Wonky Crook
grian should call the alley 'Horizont Alley' as he is a potter fan
Well it is episode 13
Pls pls pls call it diacon alley get it con
The hermits are stealing 😈 finally  Groan: lag  Me:👿
Throwing the pearls into the hole is the meanest flex I have seen yet... Well done!!!!
noice
“We’ve got a lot done today” a lot of dying!
Hey Grian,  love your videos. I thought of a punny name for the alley if you're up for it: Lev alley. Thanks for doing what you do.
ah grian telling scar to build there so he dosent need to do the back lol
grian can you put a couch in your g train [couch means a passegger cart if you dont know]
The name for grana gone Alene
If you space out your copper, it will oxidise faster. Hope you will see this and hope it will help you
Oh my god I laughed so much my belly hurts XD
call the alley way "TheHigh Greet"
the ally name maybe... "Boat Hole Ally"  :D
call it cavern alley, because it is an alley in a cavern and cav-ver-nall-ee has a bit of a ring to it
You should name the ally way gigaway and next time your going to have to replace 3 sets of armor
call is the Galley way
You're lucky to have 2 brain cells. I only have a fraction of one
Almost 7 Mil Subs?!!?!
Karma
I love how you built that a in that message :D
why you need diamonds? for did you die box???????
How about mount-b-gone ally
Hermitcraft season seven be like:  Anyone: Hey grian didn't you say you would finish the back of the mansion  Grian: We don't talk about the back of the mansion around here
What if at the back and center of the alley, was a council room, full of villagers in a circular trading hall filling the seats 😆
this is why mojang makes bedrock unbreakable.
IT SHOULD BE THE WEASLYS CANDY STORE!!!
my man grian needs to go to florida, and see the diagon alley at universal studios, I went there this summer and it looks incredible, and the roller coaster in Gringotts is fun
Call it crime alley
I mean my first starter base in Minecraft was a full on Battleship I wish I cousin join a community of Minecrafters like you guys
6.9M subscribers nice 🙂 my favorite number
Grain: I can get scar to build my mountain Scar: * sees messages in the sky Also scar: I’m going to build a sky castle, everyone wants me to build in the sky
"sending scar a message"  Grian Turf war flasbacks
A fun name for the ally is the Dimond ally
still think they alleyway should be DiaGrian Alley
....scar full walked off the edge....
you keep dying XD
also grian why are you so stupid
Idea for the name of the alley - ‘The Hermalley’ (hermitcraft + alley )
Anybody else think he should just name it The Alley It sounds kinds nice
this is too funny
Name it die again ally
6.9 million subscribers am I right
Grain sales pitch sell one of your carts to scar for him to put a swagon (I know not how to spell it) on it
Gria-gon ally
The building at the end should definitely be called griangotts Bank
Blame it on the lag!!
Grian: I'm just calling it the alley for now since it doesn't have a name My brain: Alley Tally Me: w h a t My brain: it's perfect
Me seeing the "Scar build here" sign over the back if Grian's mountain: Oh no, he didn't just do that so Scar wou-  Grian: I just put that there so Scar would build the back of my base for me.   Also me: *internally sighs and shakes my head*
lag strikes again
The cave could be call Vertic alley as a nod to Diagon alley and how cave sometimes go vertically sometimes
The entire Scar in the hole thing is a lesson in dramatic irony
The grey building would look really good with soul lanterns!
The thumbnail is good.
I think that just calling it “The Alley” is perfect
Grially way name for the ally way?
Since you seem to love adding g to everything, why not call the alley "The Galleyway"?
Griagon Alley
Put a sign hanging from the roof near the entrance of the ally way with the name of it
you should've named the trident tridont make me buy this again
Boatagon alley
“The Gally way”
Scar looks like a kid in time out when he's stuck in that bedrock hole
“These things were actually a little bit too straight” me talking about my friends
graingotts bank
14:27 furries be like
I am so tired of Grian being lazy this season.
Hear me out... The Gralley Way I know it sounds dumb but I had to say it
Grian should nane the alleyway Shaweyllay or something or Griagon alley (prob already taken before)
Grian!!!!! you should have named the trident ¨tri dent in my pocket¨
"And i believe he's going to build a mountain"  Who is going to tell him?
A name for the ally: mc.groin ally
name it calle crisologo cause in the philippines calle crisologo is an allyway(i hope this is right) where there are different shops and alot of different buildings so yeah...
If someone doesn't make an animation for the scene in the Boatem hole, I'll be very sad.   Alley name suggestions:   Financ Alley Lackadaisic Alley Territori Alley Or any other word that ends in -ally.
Nobody:  Hermits: Season 6: "let's build a automatic shop! " Season 7: "let's build diagonal builds" Season 8: "let's make montains"
Also, anyone gonna mention the *"Apart from breaking my neck"*   >w< bahaha
I suggest the Galley, like Grian Alley
Scar is unintentionally the funniest dude
grian video :) yay !! :D
Please do bonus clips more often!
I don't know if anybody is gonna get this reference but...   Copper Blue. Hoover Dam.
I’m honour of Diagon-Alley, I vote Grians should be named Later-Alley
Make it a bank and store your valuables in there
Hey but at least scar got rid of the curse of binding cat head
Mmmmm yes 6.9 subs  Nice
My assignments: due today Me: 22:32
Willy Wonkalley! Now with 20% more WONK!
Hay Brian I just want to say that the base I'm doing for my world will need 600 stacks of deep. slate pray for me 🙏
grian: just to give you an ideaR... ah, the british...
Should call it Boaton Alley G
Her grian, I know you always say it's a long process for getting tools and armour but a much easier way (If you have a good XP farm) is to use the enchantment table, what I do is put for example a sword in a level 30 enchant and most likely you will get something like fire aspect 2 and sharp 4 and then you can make 1 or 2 more and combine them it takes maybe 20 min for all tools and armour just a little more diamonds and more XP but I have a really good XP farm
Next time you need to get everything back, you should release an uncut version of you trading for everything on your second channel or something
I want a shirt that just says in a good ol times new Roman font “wonk.”
Scar sounds so sad without armour
what if the big building at the end is a bank called griangotts (like gringotts but grian).
Suggestion- what if you add a kind of building with a slanted roof?
I’m still voting for “Orthogon Alley.” Since it doesn’t actually run diagonally, but orthogonally.
The lag on the server is unbelievable
Swear to god every time grian and scar work together, at least one of them ends up dying
grian: *says something*  everyone else: *flashbacks to season 5/6/7*
Wow that is a laggy server
So close to 7 mil!
Put mini blocks for each farm in ur base :D
Idc what y'all decide to name it, I'm calling Grians base "Diagrian Alley"
Base idea in the back of the cave you should build a cat and call it the alley cat
scars new armour looks kinda sus
A suggestion for the name of the alleyway: Horizont Alley. You know, because of Diagon. Who am i kidding of course you get it
i cant stop laughing
NAME THE BANK GRIANGOTTS
You should call your base ½ street  Ally
shag.. heh
More hermitcraft epsode 13
If you wanna do the copper thing(didnt know how to spell)spread them appart
Name for the deepslate shop:  Deepslate Depot
Why do you say inventory so weird?
"It's not about the building, it's about sending a message."
ok i just came up with this; grian, god of merchants, destroyer of the economy
Hey Grian! I’m not sure if you’ll see this or not but I have a suggestion for the name of the alleyway. How about “Backwater Botem”
I don't know if you've already came up with a name for the street yet and I've missed it, but if not, how about Wigg Alley? Cause diagon alley is based off diagonally, Wigg Alley could be based of wiggly? Cause the street isn't straight
he should name the alley griagon alley
Ally name idea "Die-Again Ally'  :)
The lag is crazy on that server
Alley name idea: "Boatem Backstreet"
Scar I think you should be more concerned about your hat lol
scar's boxes should be called the DID YOU DIE AGAIN BOX lol
You could've made the message on a locked map
What if you name your base G-way
Scar should build a floating cloud city across all three sky plots!
its not a montin scar is bilding
I think you should name the alley “Ye Old alley”
15:21
If grian makes another shop in s9 on hermitcraft, it should be the g-plane next
this might be one of my favorite ones… Because I was drinking soda and spit it out on my bed from scar being in the hole..  BRUH RIP MY BED :(
grian please look at this idea for the bank         GRAINGOTS                 or       GRIANGOTS          you pick
Grian please call the big bank in the middle Griangots!!
The bank in the alley should be named “Griangotts”
You should name your alleyway, Galleyway
Griagon Alley is looking great so far
Police: why did you steal the child  Me:lag
If you don't finish something by the time the copper dam expires, do another sad montage or like have an existential crisis and become a proper hermit where you go into hiding in shame and your friends have to paper towns find you lol besides that though, thank you for doing this for us!! It is so inspiring to see these videos and try out building myself!
Griagon Alley!
Grialley Way...
I have an idea for the alleyway's name, "The fin-alley"
TRAPPING MY FRIEND IN BEDROCK THEN THROWING HIM INTO THE VOID PRANK (GONE WRONG)
“The back of the terrain I won’t have to do”  *season 7 mansion flashbacks*
place your shag here lol. and also 6.9 subs 😂
Call your mega base the grian hall
the lag on this video was O _ O  get better internet omg
Grian: a little bit of WONK   Me:😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mumbo have a bat man base
I think the name deep stone alleyway sounds pretty cool for a name idea for they alleyway.
“Grain, I think we should put some things here.”   sand collecting time!!!
Griagon Gally, simple
If the building at the end is a bank it should be called the grumbot bank
It would be cool if you could melt raw blocks of minerals
hmmm...how about cobble wobble alley? XD
This makes me scared for my deepslate castle I'm building in my server. And I'm mining for it with an iron pickaxe.
Name for the as-of-yet-unnamed Alley: the Grotto
call it diagon alley because it looks like it
I havnt been to the nether in forever but im pretty sure there is loads of deepslate there.
I know Grian’s base is mostly inspired by Diagon Alley, but the concept of an old style town in a cave really reminds me of the Tunnels book series.
Bonus clip for the win
Hi @Grian, I know you're probably not accepting ideas for your build as you most likely have it all mapped out, but I just thought it would be really cool if your build kind of... fell down towards the end. Like the road twists completely downwards (but still with buildings on the side) so you get a kind of effect like the rabbit hole from Alice in Wonderland, if that makes sense. Like a glitch in the world, or a vortex. Just food for thought.
It hurts every time to watch it happen
Grian mumbo is poor pay him to add a red stone door that’s like the brick door for diagon alley
Crazy lag
Griagon alley
you should name the ally the great grain allyway. grain not grian
Can you upload your POV of Mcc?
Grian today is my birthday thx
Its A Galley Way
You should make a milk mustache shop
I think a silly joke for the Grain train would be selling bread for an insanely expensive price.
how about you make a city called boatem city that has all your mega bases in it
What about Graigonally?
Diagrian alley the best name I can think of for the alley way
Grian I know you may not See this but I have an idea 💡 you build Sahara on the ground you first build the barge on the water end it seems that you’re good about this seasons shop on the mountains next season you could build it in the air Think about it also great content I hope you pick my idea
I hate that hole, it makes me anxious every time they go down there. It needs to be filled with obsidian.
You should build a train station near the G train, then conect it to all hermit setlements by rails, so they can travel or send items from boaten to their bases
Batat
grian teach me to wonk
I think that there are 7 or 8 sets of armor and elytra that have been sacrificed to the botem hole. Also an entire set was netherite
E
You have a scar
congrats on 6.9m sub (nice)
You should call it “DiaGRIAN Alley” for the puns
Grain pin this do not be mean to the barge
BASE NAME: Diagon ally meet Straightaway street
Scar and Grian makes some of the best moments!
at this rate grians base will be done by episode 50
Hermigon Alley
the alley reminds me of diagon alley
Grian youre turning into scar
Make the deep slate cost some more so it is worth your time.
You should name it diamond ally but pronounce it die-uh-mond its sounds imo pretty cool
galleyway
Wongk
Honestly u should call the ally "the un names ally" like u said it kind of suits with all the weird buildings
Not Alley. Galley
NUMBER 1 ON TRENDING GRIAN!! SO PROUD
aye "Grian alleyway" OR Galleyway.
Grian try to use an axe to remove the green copper
Griagon Alley
I love how instead of helping Scar right away Grian’s first thought was “I can use this to my advantage” like the power hungry bird boy he is XD
GGG
The ally should be called griagon ally
You could call the ally Diagrian ally (like diagon ally)
griagan alley for an alley name idea
OMG OMG... I had to pause the video... watching Grian and Scar's interaction with Scar trapped in bedrock and giggling like a school girl.  Then both of them dying due to Scar forgetting he didn't have any rockets.  Laughing so hard my diaphragm hurts.
put gringots bank at the back of the alleyway!!
How about the Valley Alley?
6.9m subscribers. niccceeeee!!!!!
Early
CALL IT THE GALLEY!
One of these shops should be a potion shop
Speaking of long and boring hours, you should build a tunnel bore to mine deepslate! Just a single module gives you tons of blocks with every explosion, Borkon has a good one that's easy to make. and on the plus side, youll have a tunnel you can use for purposes!
Copper deoxydises faster when they are spread out so having your copper wall barrier is very inefficient
“Hermitgon Alley”
make the building at the end of the alleyway Griangotts bank
16:39 big brain
#1 trending pog :D
maybe if they made deepslate insta-minable only with a netherite pickaxe with efficiency V and haste 2 this would be more fun to mine
The Gralleyway
You can call the alley way: The Pale City
This is the last grian episode ill see for a long time- tomorrow morning im leaving for navy bootcamp! I was so so happy to see he uploaded 🥺
Grats on 6.9 million xD
Slate in general has got to be my most favorite blocks in minecraft.
I read the title and just burst out laughing. Oh Grian...
good job grian at 6.9 mil! close to 7 mil but funny number
You should name the ally Griagonally
Jus realised grian is at 6.9 subs
You should make the spot at the back of your little part of the base a hub for all of the other  of the parts of the base?
Season 7, never builds back of base Season 8, never builds right side of base
Call the alley way a G Train Station
Diagonal Ally Irrational Ally
Dragon alley after the teg!
Name for the alleyway “trog’s way” troglodytes are subterranean creatures that exell at digging think it would fit cave in a cliff vibes
name ideas: slanted snicket
Actually name the alleyway “The Un-named Alleyway” that would be awesome
not first pog
Idea for the ally, "The Gally Way"
Can't wait for Hermitcraft season 9 and the G-Plane
Grion alley (gr-eye-on). Use it
I think grian should turn the houses into rooms and then sell them to the other hermits on the server.
Grats on #2 trending
You should call it grian street
The alley name should be griagon alley
The Galleyway
Grian you should do a map
Grian pls call the aly the everything alyway
Diagon Ally is where wizards and witches went to buy school supplies… Grain should sell out of those houses!
8:21 diagrian alley
Diagrianalley!
Wonk alley
A possible name for the ally way if you need another idea is: Cavern Ally  Also, I'm starting to think making more "Perhaps you perished" boxes will be beniful for boatem.
Is trading seriously that hard in Java?? Surly it’s just a book and an emerald, he has enough emeralds and the villagers a cured anyway, I don’t why it takes him so long
9:57 *puberty has entered the chat*
Quick tip DONT EAT WHILE WATCHING GRIAN'S VIDEOS or get ready to choke
Griam: Scar can build a mountain here Scar: I'm going to make a floating city inspired by bioshock
Griagon alley would be such a good name
13:39 . Was that pun just missed?. 'hole'd on
You can put a bunch of stuffy nobles in your base and call it Downtown Alley
1 trending Woooah
Grain, the void must never be messed with 😅😒
Let’s go grian
Techno Support!
grians grove that what you have to name it
Griagone Alley
Your base should be Griandiose Gallery. A pun on grandiose, and gallery means subterranean passageway AND a display of shops/art all of which your base is!
The *Wonkally Way*
Instant karma
It so funny
Anyone else realize Grian is at 6.9 million subscribers and is almost at 7 million
Imagine grian names it the gally way
RIP the hat
AWACA ally without a cool acronym
I was having an absolutely terrible day and this one video turned my mood around, thank you Grian
Create your own currency called grilleons
Instead of making a "Big Bank" you should make a giga base town hall sorta thing
The galley way cause grian and alley way hehe it's funny right
the gally
Grian my boi has don it again          He killed our beloved scar by trying to do a prank 👏
Idea for the alleyway name : Gregoyle alley (a play on words of grian and gargoyle)
Y'all need to make the middle as a city and the boatem hotel as the city hall
imagine the back of Grian's Christmas tree
You should add one building with window frames but no windows to simulate the window tax :p
add some wonk! wonk it up!!
oooh no the lag
He should absolutely call the alleyway “WONK way,” all caps.
Your incorrect with your math. You get the two stacks of diamonds from mining + the diamonds from sales. Little better?
Your allmost at 7m
Call the Alleyway "Allez vous?" which in english means "are you going?"
15:06-15:09 the bedrock had a breaking animation?  im kinda confused
A good name for the alley is diagon alley
minecart ally
Man you just made a cave
make "grain gotts"  for your storage system :)
Grian, professional lose-everything er
You should name the ally Mountown Ally
What’s he gonna do next season the g-plane
Maybe you could give out stone cutters free with purchase of deepslate
The alleyway of mystery
Grian you should make the alleyway named Grally (grian + alley)
What’s dam if it doesn’t hold anything back.. fill it with some water or lava please :)
Congrats on 6.9m subs
mining deepslate is such a pain compared to stone ㅠㅡㅠ i rly hope 1.18 adds a new mining buff that stacks with efficiency5/haste2 to make it possible to instamine it
I think you should name it verticalalley. Like vertica lalley. Yeah 😭😭
me when i have a back of a base: ok i just need to finish this  grian: aight i got my friend to build a mountain to cover it
You should make a secret Knocturn Alley themed hiddy hole that you can find by exploring :D
Idea: Mauneyllay
Saying Scar will be the glue holding everything together.....anyone else find that really wholesome?
I thought scar wanted to make a giant sky island
Sense you based it on diagon alley  make it a bank where you keep either all your or botem's diamonds
You should name the alley “wonk alley” lol
What about Galley for the name, Grian’s +alley
just make a backup boxes because we all know you will die more in the hole
Diagrian ally
Griangots bank
The moment I saw the title of this episode I knew it was scar and the boatem hole
Grian we are in desperate need of longer videos
Grian, you should rename your shop to the G-rain
you could it the galleyway
Greagon ally
GRIANGOTTS AND DIAGRIAN ALLEY
Did anyone else see the bedrock start to break at 15:05 when scar clicked on it?
11:14 I thought he's gonna say "i don't have time to be a bilionaire"
Grian should put a little I buy it deepslate shop so he doesn't need to go mining for it too often like I buy 1stack of deepslate from u for 1 diamond and he sells it for 2 stacks per 3 diamonds
Nice subscriber count
grian explaining things: WONK
Next season hes gonna sell "Mayby You Were Masacured" boxes
Grian can’t you just uses tnt
When boatem becomes the shopping district u should make another barge and combine the g train and barge into one company
life is the time between waiting for grian to upload again
20:12 that "hello"
horizont alley
20:12 scars hello sounds so scared an it gets me every time 😂😂😂
“I wont have to build the back of the terrain”  Me:*instense mansion flashbacks*    Also call the alleyway Griagon Alley
“Apart from breaking my neck what else are we going to do today.”  also grian should’ve named the trident “tri to believe that scar made me buy this from him so i could give it to him”
Honestly I think you should call the alley ‘Grogwarts Alley’
Jsnxbdjsnxjdnd
Maby call it the boatemway
The alley should be called Grainy Way pronounced graney way
Griagon Alley
Diagrian Alley
Is it SHAG or SWAG?  I'm confused lol
Scar: i had a trident on me Grian, In a very french way: *oh nó*
octagon alley because season 8
so sad
The WONK Alley
Diamond'b'gon Alley.
Grian is a wizard!
grian should make a "Wonk Droid"
"the alley" sounds like a little nightmares level.
6.9 million subscribers man! Nice
you should name it valley alley, i think it would be a good name
This isn’t originally my idea but I want to keep spreading it around—the building at the far end of the alleyway needs to be Griangotts Bank
name for the alley, diagon alley, diamondsgon alley. lol
HE NAMED A TOOL AFTER ME!!!
Grian was like  Mom scar is making a title sequence again!!
The Ally that must not be named......
You can put your storage in the bank like the loot
Also grian  do u curse  off camera?
5 stacks of deep slate for 4 diamonds 💎
First time i see the coolest kind of thumbnail.
3:20 "It's been a full day and still no sign of scar building here" are you kidding me Grian? There's literally a gigantic sign floating in the air right I front of you as you said it. You literally just built the sign, Grian
Cat of binding
The Gally!
I have a name for the alley, it is corny I know but…      The Galley/Gallery
Here’s a name suggestion for the alley Giga bay alleyway
You should make gringotts your storage room
died on purpose to find a way to end the video?
You really should call the alley 'Horizont alley'
Anyone want to tell Grian that Scar is not planning on building a mountain?
STOP DYING NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Name it the cat alleyway and put cats everywhere just a suggestion dont attack me ;-;
Grian you should call the alley the Galley (pronounced alley with a g)
In terms of alley names, if you can't use Diagonalley why not use Horizont-alley (as its on a flat surface) or Vertic-alley (being part of a mountain)?
Someone's probably said it already, but that middle building you're planning?  Griangotts.
CALL THE ALLY ....GRI-AN ALLY .....basically like di-gon ally....PUNS
but scar didnt pay for your items when he pushed you right?
Anyone else just absolutely love grian’s timelapse music?
Add amethyst to the ceiling of the alley and call it the amethyst alley.
Grian You Should Name Your Ally:   The Grially  or  The Grally.
Call the alley"grianon"alley
Nice job on hitting 69 million subs bro!
Sakura Miko be like:
Grian says 6 boxes of deep slate witch isent much  Me 6 shulker boxes of deep slate lasts me like a decade
12:00 definitely lag😅
20:30
“Which means I probably won’t have to do any terraining on the back” *Season 7 mega base much?*  Edit: ...  *You’ve just broken your neck.* (Minecraft neck)
69.... is everywhere...
If you spend a decent amount of diamonds on it you can call it "diamonds-are-gone" ally
16:35
We need griangotts
This is what i saw on bdubs stream
Grian ally, Galley!
I love how grian is totally fine with bribing scar's freedom but selling a stack of deepslate for 3 diamonds? literally impossible.
Grian should make extra Armour sets
"The Wonky Alley"
#1 on trending!!!!!!!!!
"these buildings were a little too straight..."  So we put chemicals in the wood!
The oh no you made reminded me of the “oh the humanity” news clip from the Hindenburg
The gally?‽?
Alley name idea: The G'Alley. A galley is actually a type of boat as well so it fits quite nicely with the boatem them
Again?
Thx for uploading you vid helped me get through the first day of school
RIP GRIAN stuff again
Grian scolding Scar while he's trapped in the bedrock is like a mum scolding you for doing something you shouldn't have.
10:45 didn’t look like shac or swag to me…
It's up to you but I'd think it'd be cool if you made the G-Train a part of your base. Maybe something like a train going through a tunnel in the mountain. And you could have other hermits shop at a train station inside your base. Just an idea.
The 10k comment
Hi
wait, two brain cells???? GRIAN IS MUMBO JUMBO, THIS IS OFFICIAL GUYS HE HAS HIDDEN REDSTONE BIG BRAIN IDEAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“The Grially” (Gry-ally)
The Alley... Diagon Alley... Dialley
digon vallay
The Boatem Hall is a good name for the alley
Alley name: G-agone Alley
It could be The Galleyway  Kind of like g train
others: school starts at wednesday me: 18:11
6.9 mill NICE
So your base has no *straight* buildings, and it's basically named *"Ally"*. You should lean into that
Losing everything 2: electric boogaloo
gold tools are faster
Hey G! Just a suggestion for the name of your Unnamed alley, you could name it the “Gralley” i know it sounds a bit silly but i think its a pretty good name!
Grian should name the alleyway "Redstoner's Alley" because he is building farms in the buildings
You're gonna call it "the ally" untill you fin-ally find a name for it, am I right?
they need to build a void base in the bedrock hole
You could give the deepslate work to someone with more time and pay them 1 diamond per every couple of sales for their labor. It's a good way to expand Boatem Inc
this is the last day before me summer vacation ends so im so happy to see grian posting a hermitcraft vid 😊😊✌

okay all I have to say is one word pog
Grian's grotto would be a nice name
Silt touch goes slightly faster
rip
It has to be a bank called Griangotts right, come on. Trying so hard to come up with a pun for the alley 😂
the deep dark alleyway
DiaGrian Alley  It's perfect
the name for the alley should be diagon valley.
@Grian Make a "little" house. like the one from stuart little, somewhere in the scheme of things.
Grian u should name the alley  Giagon Alley
this reminds me of hary potter dicon ally
6.9M HORRAY
Grian call it horizont alley
You need an engine for the g-train
What if grian made the big building at the back of the mountain a train station, he was planning on making one anyway and it would fill in the alley nicely. Plus it could be sunk into the ground so it doesnt intrude too much.
You should have named the trident “tri didn’t believe you made me buy this”
He should call it the deathly gallows
Grian's "did you die box?" function a bit differently in this season lol
Scar is building a cloud city ala BioShock Infinite.... he can build it over all of them...
If you end up making a bank at the end of the alley you should name it Griangotts
Nonspecific Alley?
Hi!
Love yaaa grian Make Vidsss Plsss
You should call the alleyway “the unnamed alleyway”
Grian this may sound weird but y not the Gralley
Grian, I love you. But I think the G-train is a bit invasive if we take into account that it is placed literally in the middle of the giga-base, I think you should move it. :(
does the g train sell g strings?
If you end up making the building on the end a bank, you can name it Griangotts!
If you don’t name that bank grian-gots, so help me god…
Just a suggestion for the name of the alleyway. How about the mauiway or meowiway?
NAmes for the alleyway could be "The Grotto" or "The Underground" or maybe "the Wonky Hollow" and yes I did  just search synonyms for cave
Grianally? Griangonally?
Grian, i- 6 BOXES IS A LOT-
GRIAGON ALLEY
#2 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING be like
Again at the same place
Grian u have bad luck cuz its episode 13 get it
I think Diagonal Passage would be a good name for the alley
I really want scar to build over all of their bases like how in bioshock infinite wasn’t just one island. Also Grian said it himself he wants scar to be the glue that holds them together, it works.
Grian if the copper is touching itself it takes much longer to oxidize you should spread them out it's much quicker about twice as fast
Dear G Man,         I have a proposition. Season 7 was the barge, 8 is clearly a train.  For season 9, you should totally do some luxury planes and heli's.  Continue with the "vehicle" theme                    ~ Sincerely  (Insert name here because mine is "Inappropriate")
Grian: not knowing what to call the alleyway  Me: he should call it the grain gap
the poor barge after all of its faithful serves
Most youtubers: time to mine off camera Grian: time to collect my diamonds
The names of grians items do get better  But that boots tho...
Griagonalley
You should call the alley the wonky walley alley
*'Im just gonna add some WONK to my build"*
Maybe u should call the alleyway, “The Unknowns Alley”
Name suggestion: The Galleyway?
Paragon Alley
Name the alley “the Graially
Name the alley angle alley
Wonkyyyyy
Grian: Everything was looking a bit too normal, so i decided to turn to the Wonk gods, and add a substantial amount of Wonk to the buildings, did i mention the Wonk?
Wonky lane

The Alley is actually a good name.
Grian you should do WEESLEYS WIZARD WEESES but with your Minecraft character instead of Fred and George.
u should call the alley horizont alley
I kinda wish he would turn the alley into shops so it can be "Downtown Botem"
in instead of diaogon ally, I'd say grigon ally ;)
6.9 mil subs baby!
I like how Grian was mining deep slate before he decided to mine the diamonds
Grain episode 1:I won't build a mega base.  Grain now:let's build a giga base
I think u made ur own cave mining all that deep slate
Deepslate is not cobblestone is like Netherite tier of stone in Minecraft

Me sees the title: god damnit not again
He posted this at 4:20 noice
YOOOOOO #2 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING LETS GOOOOO

How to Build a Base Accoridng to Grian:  1 Get an idea 2 Plan it out 3 Build the enterance  4 Build the inside  5 Trick Scar into doing the back
What is instead of the Alley you call it Grain Lane.
Apart from breaking my neck, what are we doing today? Lol so casually too
name for the allyway:the hermit allyway
13:59 the way he screamed scar was agro
Okay, this has to be my most favorite episode of Season 8 so far!!! Oh my gosh it was amazingly great!!!

Call the ally way “diamond ally” pronounced “dee-uh-mon-day al-ee”
Why don't you call the alley. Grain Street
You should name it the grinagal ally
Grian uploaded this in 2am in Philippines;-;
Grian will you be adding gringots?

E
Hallo
Take so long to create videos
6.9M subs😳😳😳😳😳
Hey Grian! You Should name the alley way, the Galley
the alleyway should be name the g Lane
you should call the alley "Graingon alley"
whats the song used in 19:07
Grian you should make a Gringotts bank.
Name the ally the gally
The alley should be called Grianagon Alley
A few years ago I was a bit too straight. So I added some 𝔀𝓸𝓷𝓴
Just call it A Dark Alley so people can say "I don't want to meet Grian in a Dark Alley"
the ally way that shall not be named
Also whats the song with the kazoos
Grian, you should make the bank be called GRIANgotts, because PUNS
So for the deep slate. If you don't want to sell it at the current price you could make it a "loss leader" if you surround the deepslate with desirable high profit items even though you're selling at a loss or even the extra impulse sales will make up for it. Example: mumbo needs deepslate he comes to the train grabs some then notices a deal on sand next to it. He's already there buys the sand boom u created an unnecessary sale
The boatem hole is actually a problem
end video scene was a great idea
awesome vid grian you are so good!
The pit claims more souls~
Name for your alley: Griagon Alley
Diagrian alley? Griangotts? Just a few ideas…
15:04  The thing I don't get is why there was breaking progress on the bedrock block when scar started punching it. Could he have escaped the whole time?
YOO 6.9 Subscribers!?
just imagine that scar builds something random in the sky where the message is at
Seeing how tall your alley buildings are... Call it "Vertik Alley" or something along those lines :) Lil easter egg as well.
Ok here me out a name for the ally could be…Downtown Ally….I’ve made my suggestion now I will leave thank you for your time have a good day
He knows he’s gonna steal so much, he can blame it all on lag
Idea name for the alley: Polygon Alley 'Cause of the original inspiration and what it became, and Minecraft is very blocky... full of polygons! :D
It seems Obvious to me.  You should name it....  Griangone Alley.....
Me taking a test: "Now I have to activate my 2 brain cells to remember how to spell things."
The Boatem Hole is like The One Ring from LOTR. It has some degree of sentience, and can almost influence events to happen a certain way. So, Grian and Scar have fallen victim to it's antics.
For the bank you could call it griangots since your build is inspired by diagon alley
GRIAN YOU NEED TO DO THIS next season theme it to like to the great revolution think about it right now the G-train is delivering to the barge!!!!!!! You need to like theme your next shop to like something like a shop cart
"If I dont get something done by the time that this oxydizes, the server will result in an apocalypse." GRIAN NO NOT AGAIN-

Season 6: Circle = no back to finish Season 7: Mansion = no back decorations 3rd Life: Finally some sort of ba- Season 8: oh god oh no not again...

You should name the alley griagon alley

Although u can mine a lot of diamonds in the amount of time you can get deep slate, while you are getting deep slate you can also get diamonds, so depending on your luck you can actually make more by mining deep slate
Name the alleyway digone alleyway
Idea: partner with scar to make a wagon with stock from the g-train. And it’s called the g-wagon ; )
The anonymous alley
The alley should be called the underground
add some cats (alley cats hehe)
Grian the big building at the end should be your storage room and called the Bank of Chests.

Grian: Only 6 shulker boxes Me: ONLY?!?!

When scar told grian he doesn't have rockets  Grian: *Instant regret*
The Alleyway could be called Griangon Alley. Oh yeah, and the bank could be called Griangots
incredible episode, i laughed SO much XD
Grian: "You guys don't get to see this too often - but stocking back the items is a long and arduous process"  Shows us stocking back the items for the 4th time this season.

The hole requires more souls
Here is a name for the alleyway : Dra-o-gon alley (then add a dragon or something idk)

The deep slate train car should be the coal carriage on a regular train.
The boatem needs a redstone door on the hole for safety purposes

Vertic Alley could be a good name, it’s a spin on Diagon Ally, both being puns (Diagonally, Vertically)
Dragon ally  Da-Grian ally  Idk
It's not a moss chair, it's a "garden chair"
Two tasks:  1st fill blocks into the bedrock in the 'Boatem Hole'.  2nd make a fence around the 'Boatem Hole'!!!! 3rd P.S. this is why you and GoodTimesWithScar cannot have Netherite gear.
Scar I going to biuld a sky city

Next seasons shop should be named the g plane
You both deserved that . . .

Who could have possibly foreseen that making the center of your communal base area a big void hole could have consequences?!
The middle should be the G-train office or something

6.9 million subscribers.   _nice_
Grain you should put fortune 3 on your pick so you can get more deepslate

See the diamonds you get while mining deepslate as subsidies.
Grian: writes giant message in the sky   Me:flashbackS to “did you press the button twice” from season 6

How have you not come up with calling the alley "Diagrian Alley"?
Name the alley niatnuom alley
What I'm wondering is how rich the void is at this point? How many diamonds worth of stuff has it claimed? How many kills does it have?
back of the mansion 2.0
Build gringots in the alley way and connect all the bases by rail
There should be a bank called griangotts!
What about doing two timelapses at the same time? One where you are trading the stuff for Scar and one just standing in front of the Copper Dam watching it oxidise?
How did you get that enchanted golden apple in your enderchest mr. g?
Ally names:AllyOPPS  grally and the back way:)

10:43 GROOVY BABY YEAHEA -our 2nd best spy after johnny english
wouldn't getting the experience for the armor be the logest part, if so couldn’t you just go to the ender peral farm to get a load of ex?
Maybe the bank at the end of the alley should be called Griangottz? I’m just sayin  Edit: and make it a portal to the nether, and a gold farm.  Edit 2 Electric Boogaloo: Also an idea for the name of the Alley… how’s Horizont-Alley… take a guess where I’m getting inspiration for these names.
How about naming the ally “G-Street”?
Alleyway name = wonky way
Grian is so smart : aRGORus like what does that mean
I think "Grianscliffe" Would be a good name for your alley
vertamore (Vert A More) alley. like a pun, vertical v Diagonal, Vertamore v Diagon alley?

Wonk
You should call the alley “ Diagrian alley”
WOW good job on the very extremely creative names
The angled alley?
Hi grian, you should totally take a trip to norich in Norfolk, it's the best preserved medieval town in the uk, it's very similar to York but less busy
If I were you I wouldn't fall for the "Lag Steal" trick
u and mumbo should make one of those auto mining things, and use that to restock deepslate. could be a part of boatem co or whatever u guys are calling it lol
@Grian you should name the ally 'Grians Gray Tone Town.'
Griangotts for diagrian alley

Lol deep slate at that price I thought you would turn around and it'd be gone
Diagon Ali
You need to call it diamond alley like diagon alley
Scar getting trapped in Bedrock is a very Scar thing.
When Grian pretends to leave the hole and then spies on Scar, hearing him mildly panic tho
When they died to the hole I cried with laughter😂😁😁
GRIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you have made a trend of two songs from Hermitcraft so now you need to make another one for season 8.... also love your content.
The building at the end should definitely be called Griangotts Bank
You should make the chimneys on your new builds wonkey, to get them to the same level of wonk as the other wonkey buildings..
Grian: Very creative names Me: Where have I seen this naming technique before? Seems almost outdated
If Grian doesn't name the alleyway the Croocked Rave Alley Cave I'll get mad

Congratulations you got 7 mil
The builders:and I'm finished Me and my cousin: now it's like a city  Me check the map: ohh it's not like a city 😫
In the space in the back of the cave you should put the town hall building from season 7
Hey Grian… can the alley be named “Grain be gone alley”? You can put wheat and bread on the entrance sign
Hi Hi and hi
Great alleyway, but it could use more wonk.
The Bagon Gown — don’t know why but it sounds kinda nice. Idk
Nooooooo you lose you stuff
Hello cool vid

You both just lagged into the hole
I still can't believe last season's Mumbo For Mayor became this season's Mumbo For CEO
I didn't know that Grian had 6.9 million subs. Very nice. Veeeeryyyy niceeeeee
We should call it the gallyway
Does Vertic Alley work?
You should make a hobit house

This is an awful pun but you could call your base “diagrian alley” because diagon alley and grian together… ok imma stop talking now this is not great lmao
You should name the ally "DiaGrian Alley"
Grians idea of productive: Theft  Sacrifice  And copper wall
When he was digging straight down, I kinda hoped he would fall in lava.

GRIAN
Put random stuff in the comics
Oooooooh it’s diagon ally (or however the hell you spell that)  That means you are going to live in gringots (shut up! I only watched the movies)
X
X
Day 36 of telling Grian to name the Alleyway "Vertic Alley" because Diagonal Alley is a play on the word diagonally because it goes, well, diagonally, but this goes vertically... unless it goes from east to west in which case I would recommend Horizon Alley because then it goes horizontally...
D
And I am on it
D
X
S
There is a beta form of 1.17 part 2
J
where is third life???  i miss it...
Idea: Griagon Alley like diagon alley
Name idea for the ally: the grally?
Somewhere somehow Grian has to incorporate a "sorry baby, but the G-train has left the station" reference from Jim Carrey's Grinch
PLEASE MAKE GRIANGOTTS AS YOUR STORAGE SYSTEM
griangotts: builder's bank
I see diagrian alley is coming along well.
man those buildings sure do have some 𝕎𝕆ℕ𝕂
Everytime you do shenanigans with scar by the boatem stuff goes missing....  Eh, probably a coincidence...
I feel like the alley should be called the griagon alley
Diagon ally
I hope you make a Gringotts Bank also you can name it Griangotts
I feel like the alley should be called the griagon alley
Diagon Alley Call The Alley that
Since it's so wonky n wobbly you could call it Wibbly Wobb Alley or Wobb Alley...like wobbly....
I hope the center building is Graingot’s Bank
Well well well, if it isn’t the consequences of Grian’s actions…
Impulse's base: Willy Wonka's Factory Mumbo: The Lincoln Chair
The void is going to be the richest player in this series :)
Make griangots the bank
this is a alley way strip mall hybrid
Tri-Dent in my wallet
Make the deeps late train part into a daily deals where you have limited time things for special prices or something so you don't have to restock it with deeps late but it doesn't waste a space
I was thinking of a name for the ally and I was thinking hailgon ally
If you are hiring someone to resource gather for you I don't mind digging to help you
Grian if only that trident lagged into your inventory
I think you should name your build/alley is Grialley:)
Where will the Weasley Twins have their shop?!
Call the alleyway socks
I suggest Griagon Alley
You should call the ally the Griangon Ally
The alley of the grain
Some il-mango dude will do an automatic deep slate thingy farm
So a name for the alley could be a play on Diagon Alley and the word pun the movies make of "diagonally" except your alley is straight, for the most part, so it could be called "Foroword Alley" or maybe "Wiendy Alley" or some play like that.
Name the alley “horizont alley” since the reference is linked to diagon alley
You should call it green Vf
I think you should name the alley "Diagrain Alley"  Yes I meant to spell grain, it is not a typo
Phoenix ally
Idea: Hermitcraft, but its terraria
So, Grian is making a base called Ally and none of the buildings inside are straight... seems a little fruity to me
Scar: "Dies"  Also Scar: "Time to make some money"
Tell me a joke
"If a project doesn't get done by the time this(Copper) oxidizes, the server will result in an apocalypse." What kind? Maybe another war, perhaps?

Scar is the true definition of chaotic neutral.

Nobody: Grian: Just casually adding some *wonk* to the alley way!
Tell me a joke
Ok so Grian said that at the end, he's building a big building or a bank, I have a suggestion for naming of the bank, Griangots
Call the ally griagonally
Just hit 69 subs, share this comment with everyone
Name it "The Wonky Walkway"

Since the inspiration is Diagon Alley, and Grian has that ender dragon egg, I think Dragon Alley would be neat of a name. Or maybe Griagon Alley :P
Grian call the alleyway ‘diagonal alley’
He jumped in yes you were digging  but he jumped in
Tell me a joke Tell me a joke

“May, you’ll like this one” “Ah well done, you’ve found Grians back ally”
Me: "How does it feel to be trending on gaming?" Grain: "Normal?" Me: "Sounds about right." You: "This was supposed to be funny?" Me: "No"
The exact moment grian said wonk I thought Willy Wonka
Tell everybody a joke          M

scar falling into void made me so sad :(
Why don’t you call it the G-alley so galley
Tell me a joke
Here's a stupid name for your alleyway. ILLUMEN-ALLE It sounded much better in my head

The amount of trouble that hole gave them is uncanny
You should call the alleyway "Compact Corridor"
6,9M subs Nice
Tell me a joke
Dude I name my silk touch stuff silky I feel copied
You should name your alleyway the wonky way
I'd say increase your prices on deepslate. Yes it's just cobble, but if the demand is high and it's that painful to get, the price should go up accordingly, don't undervalue the time you spent
Alley name suggestion: Back Alley Boatem or BAB for short
I’m on vacation and I’m still making time for grian I mean I’m late but I’m here
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SCAR'S HAT I don't care about anything else JUST THE HAT

Grian’s subscriber count is  N I C E
Pumpkin

Hi
Me, a Minecraft noob, listening to grian complain about mine deep slate in under a second: CONFUSED SCREAMING
I am not a 4 year old but…  (Your at 6.9 mil)
For naming the alley - Horizont Alley, Vertic Alley?
do strength potions help with mining?
Chicken chicken chicken chicken
You could hear how mad scar was when grian mined from underneath him no matter how hard he tried to hide it
BOATEM Crypto: 1 Galleon 17 Sickles 29 Knuts
Dia"grian" ally
Grian you gotta sell the Deep slate for more so you are motivated to restock it. Don't feel bad for charging 3-4 diamonds a stack when it's the only way you'll want to restock it.
sense the ally slops down how about 'vertic ally'?
Call Green egg chicken
Is grian ever going to use "work" song for timelapses ? Hopefully yes
16:34 actually Scar run down himself, you're not to blame grian
Grian should build Gringots in minecraft

@Grian if you place the copper blocks on the ground 1 block away from each other, they should age faster
You should make an upside down house that would be really cool
Idea for the name of the alley   Diagonal alley… because diagon and most of the builds are diagonal
"Step-Grian, I'm stuck -I'm coming for you step-Scar"
PATCH THE HOLE HAHAHAHAA
Grain here's a tip. if you space the copper out and make sure their not touching each other, they will oxidize  faster.

The trident for Scar should be named "Tri I can't believe you made me buy this dent"
Hey Grian I think building some sort of pub in the alley would be pretty pog

Grian try using a gold pikaxe to mine the deepslate with mending unbreaking III and efficiency 5

I love how grian does not give a care in the world whenever he loses EVERYTHING and he gets it back straight away but it would probply take me like 7 months to get lol
You should tell some houses
Can't wait until Grian realizes that Scars building a city on a cloud not a mountain and that he's wasted time and potentially diamonds to get him to build there and he'll still have to do the back of the mountain

Would’ve liked to see the reference picture first before the build time lapse
Season 7 grian: it's about the principle!!!!! Season 8 grain: it's about the diamonds!!!
How about you call it Apollyon Alley
scar i have rockets! *throws all of them into void*
So... just putting it out there, but, seeing as this is inspired by Diagon Alley, shouldn't there be a bank at the end called - wait for it - Griangotts? Perfect place to keep the G-Train profits... and more besides!
You need some efficiency 6 on that
6.9
Dia-grain Alley
i have a name for the ally griagon ally LOL
you should add glow squids to showcase in the first warped building
You should make a barge themed building as a little memorial to the barge in the alleyway.
The ally should be named  Pie-Agon ally
You should name the alley Griagon alley
Griagon Alley
Surely it has to be Horizont Alley
Since you have the G-train aka the Grain, the alley should be the G-alley aka the Galley

Call it the Erie allyway
You must feed the boatem hole with the inventories of the sacrificed to satiate it’s bloodlust Also congrats on 6.9 million subscribers
It would be cool if the g train station would be platform 9 & 3/4
Wow, #2 on trending!
1 word: GRIANGOTTS
This is basically what happens when you dig an any hole for any reason
Cliffsnalyway
Maybe call the alley the Griallyway?
Definitely needs to be named Diagonal Alley.  ...Get it? 👀 Yeah?   Yeah.
Grian's just making diagon alley.
You could make an overworked gold farm in The Hogs Head. If that’s too hard but still want a pun based farm then it could just be a carrot farm.
Grian just casually Ignores diamonds after digging right on them
I have a name for the alley “Teggion Alley”
since when has this channel been at 6.9 million subscribers?!!!
Whist allyway. Two fun and fantastic words. I think it fits
I can imagine the owner of the building in real life comments saying 'that's where I live'
The new copper daa
The G-train needs a locomotive
Call it the cavinous alleyway because its a alleyway in a cave
Personally I believe we should stucj with the British theme and call the alley alley road in reference to the Beatles and you could add a crosswalk somewhere in there with the members of boatem walking across it  Upvote if you agree
you should make that cart a special offer cart
Is the trident drop rate different on Java edition? Why is scar upset about losing a trident in particular? I get drowneds to drop tridents more than they don't on bedrock
22:39
Welp getting scars box must've put a trident in your wallet
I just realized bdubs was live-streaming when they both fell out of the void.  Still, what a bro , trying to help Scar before falling into the void, even if it didn’t work out.
look at A Casual Cactus's comment it's really good
Not my idea but you should build grian-gotts
U could call it The Galley (Grian Alley), which would be great for a boat themed building or entrance as well
Potential base name could be origin alley
Do a building that's like a reference to Sahara
Hermitgon alley
You should make a griangotts bank in your alley.
Since Diagon Alley is a pun on Diagonally, why not name it Horizont Alley?
Have you heard of sidewinders, they're named after the trail they leave behind in the sand, and it reminds me of your alleyway street
Grian:sends scar a message.   Me:Who already watched scar’s video
you should probably stay with diamond gear for most of the season if i were you and stock up on neitherite ingots every once in a while
*Steals* ✨lag!!!✨
LOL I saw Grian and Scar fall out of the void on Bdubs' stream least night. I assumed it was a regular boatem sacrifice, not this disaster
I think you should call the alleyway griagon alley lol btw love your channel
It should’ve been Tri-dent in my wallet
The griagon ally, thank me later
I suggest calling it, diagonal ally
4:22 "Octagon Mega Shopping Soon!" I'm confused.
How about naming the alley Dieagain alley after diagon ally??
It should be called the grially
You should finish the alley way in the final episode of this season and call it the grinally.
When Scar keeps punching Grian off the edge of the Boatem hole: Me: This is going to be a thing for a couple of episodes, isn’t it?
He should name the alley  Ally G
Your alley needs a shady alley where nefarious deals take place.
Congrats on getting #2 on trending for gaming grain!
"It's not about the items, it's about sending a message"

Mumbo is a literal couch potato xD
Boatem Alley
Petition for Grian's big building in the alleyway to be Gringotts-inspired, containing a storage room at the bottom like the vaults (from deathly hallows)
1:28 tf happened here?!
6.9 million subscribers gg u did it.
Instead of Diagon Alley, what about DiaPUN Alley?
DiaGrian Alley, it’s right there
Diagon Alley
The  boatem hole has killed 4 people and gets larger and larger it will become into a black hole
Yay thanks for the reference from s7 ep20
U should make the corner building a glass sand and gravel store
✨wonk✨
If this copper dam doesn't become a random reason to start some shenanigans I'll be very sad
You could rent out the buildings in the alleyway to other hermits
Number 2 on trending! :D
Grian: D-doesn’t that have curse of binding on it? Scar: No- Also Scar: **whispers** Dang it… PLEASE IM DYING HAHAHA 😂 😆
12:10 I present to you my thesis statement that Grian is just Family Friendly Michael Reeves
Did anyone else notice the person flying at 0:51
Grian has got an award. Most bottom deaths at once
The time lapse music is always amazing!
The Specific Alley.. that's my first thought of Edit: Diagon Alley - diagonally so.... yeah
VERTIC ALLEY
"Sending Scar a message" me: OMG SEASON 7 REFERENCE?!!?!
the name of the trident could be : "you have scared me for life with this price"
you should name the alley the Grane alley
The boatem hole has claimed more lives than mumbo this season
should we tell him, scar actually wants to build a steampunk city on a cloud
instead of diagon ally it could be diagonally and then greengates or a verson of it
In ireland there is a place called The gpo that would be so cool at The End of The ally
Every episode since Botem got a void hole the Botem Gods have claimed a sacrificial hermit
After collecting a bunch of the stuff for my base, I can safely say 2 diamonds per stack of deepslate is a steal. I'd pay that all day.
Can poultry man return this season🐔
You could call it Horizont Alley or Vertic Alley  Edit: Spelling
hopefully grian didnt forget that beacon
You should call it Dig-an-alley
The grydon alley??
Why don’t u make nether its armour
Griaaaan I already see that on mambo video 🤣🤣🤣
Cmon Grian…
I like the idea of a bank by the back of the ally with a big gold dollar sign at the top.
Idea for grain: try and make more buildings on top of the mountain you have made and make the mountain bigger to have the bottom part look like the top part.. basically layers of the same thing your doing but with different buildings?  (But I just watched the video after putting this comment so 😭)
Grian, please read this, you have got to make the building at the end of the alley way (hear me out) into Griangotts Bank
Ayyyyyeeeess 2d of trending for gaming. Congrats
You could call it horizont alley or vertic alley
Gigalley? is gonna look pretty cool?!👀👀
Grian: "And we will leave this here to oxidize."   *one copper block immediately starts to oxidize*
Not okay
Wonk is now my new favourite word      Also, if you see this Grian, you should call the Alleyway “Trickery Terrace”!
You should name the alleyway: minecon alley
Diagrian alley
1 stack 3 diamonds, 2 stacks for 5 diamonds
Absolutely love these timelapses
Grain potters lane instead of the ally way
A big bank down there could be cool, You could also do like a underground storage system similar to hogwarts and sell storage rooms to hermits maybe
You should sell houses with tax too
the boatem yeeteth, and the boatem yoinketh away
You should sell more houses too                    H
It's a gralley way
i know the perfect name for the alley after this name wonkally
Grian getting knocked off and screaming SCAR gave me horrible Lion King flashbacks.
Scar: At what point do I break it to you.  Grian: Break what to me.  Scar: ...I had a Trident on me...  Grian: Aw Noo...
You should call the alley: The Great Gralley (Grian Alley)
Grian: Makes buildings  Also Grian: *Becomes Gunther* WONK WONK WONK
Grialley......grialley
Grian could have called the g-train the grain-train
As opposed to diagon alley Call it Dye-A-Mond alley
Congratulations
laG
The aly should be called griagon aly
Well hello
Gally Way
why is nobody talking about grian digging straight down and finding diamonds immediately? the chances of that are so slim :o
Idea for name of alleyway    Alleyway of Wono
The alley should be called dia-grian alley
Put greengots in the back
Grain did not play skyblock enough...
alley of Maui
i hope you include more of the collecting diamonds and stocking the g-train, the shops all the hermits make are my favorite part
“The Grally Way”
grian has an agenda
Name it “The Cave Lane”
Grian you should make gringots where you store all your diamonds.
WONK
Grian stop taking other peoples jobs (dying) lol
You should name a bank if you create one graingots
Dia-grian alley

Diagrian alley
GRIANN , SEND MORE VIDEOS PLSSS , I LIE THEM SO SO MUCH
It was at this moment that I realized how far behind on the timeline Grian is compared to Mumbo. That sign to Scar has been in Mumbo's vids for many episodes now.
Am I the only one who noticed the bedrock is fake? When scar punches the bedrock when he’s stuck, it begins to break! So I think it’s a texture pack
You do realise that that third message looks like it says: Oi!! Scar, mate, buddy, pal!! Place your SHAG here!! We all know what shagging is, right? If you don't know, look up and watch Austin Powers.
Only 6 boxes
Instant karma for extortion
Grian: You dont get to see this often  Me: Ah yes, because its not like 4 ppl have already lost all their stuff now this season
You should sell some houses in the alleyway
Name it Dimslate Alley
2:45 Gringotts 😎
Sell beacons
name the alleyway da grian alley
Get Netherite
grain i love your content!!!
Your  alleyway could be called: Main Grain Lane
Call it diagonally lol
So Diagon alley was called that because it sounds like diagonally.  You could call in your base Horizon Alley (like horizontally) Or even Peril Ally (like parallel)
the Galley would be good. G-Alley :D
Suggestion for the Alley's Name: Polygon Alley.  Eh, eh?
The GALLEY
Since it seems very inspired by Diagon Alley, name it Horizont Alley.
You should call the alley the ‘Galley’ b/c I feel like it fits with the g-train
Grian is almost at 7 mil!
wonk
Call it the Gralleyway
hello
16:44 the mic peak
Wow
I’m glad train and mumbos videos have been recently uploading more frequently
At this point I just want some building filled with wheat called the Grianary.
How about loktow alley?
Call the alleyway, hostel boulevard
Whats the song at 19:15 i love it
Cavern Alley:The City in The Dark
Boop
grian did a bit of trolling
Am I the only one who is getting diagon alley vide from the alley
What music was Grian using when he was replacing Scar's items?
It could be called... Grion Ally...
You should tell some houses in the alleyway
Any ideas for the names of the next tool set of "did you perish" boxes?
Grian: I have a great idea! Lets make a botem hole for the botem pole! Also Grian: continues to die pretty much once an episode
You can really tell that grian and Mumbai are friends lol “It lagged into my inventory”  Edit: I’m not changing Mumbai, it’s too funny
It looks like diagon alley

Nice sub count
Every time s hermit mines they immediately find diamonds and I never find anything
Train person here! Your train is very nice but very inaccurate! But it was okay until the deepslate truck... though it is okay in minecraft terms you might want to thing of remaking it into a 7 plank wagon style truck!! Aside from that your g-train is very nice!
You should name it griangonalley
KARMAAAAA
To solve the problems, make a rocket shop.
Hour 4 8.5k comments 6.9m subs ;)

You should put black glass at the bottom of the hole
You got that, *WONK*
A tip for mining just a little faster is a aqua affinity helmet and a conduit to get just a little faster, it should give you instamine with a beacon!
It should be called The VAlley
Someone should keep count about how many lives the boatem hole has claimed, lol
Sticking with the diagon alley theme you ought to name your bank 'Grian Gets Bank'.
Name it Xelqua ally. Ya know... For the memes
Scar wants to build a city in the sky
You should name the alley way rocky road

Wonk....now I have a way to describe my fingers

Gri... Don't bother upgrading to netherite lol
Me: mines for 3 hours and ends up losing diamonds Grian: mines for 10 seconds and ignores the diamonds.
I just realized grian has 6.9 million subscribers
Anyone else think he should build stuff without time lapse like a lil bit
Grian should build something like weasleys joje shop

Scar: Executes perfect ender pearl Grian: Breaks blocks below Scar Both: Die in void    Karma.

Grian has 6.9 million subs. Lol
Griagon alley
Alleyway name: griagon alley
I think that the base should be called diagrian alley
My base I completely made of that stuff it's not fun to mine
You should name it the “Alley Grain” and the Grain is Misspelled on purpose
Mumbo/Grian: in interrogation room "i didn't steal anything! The money lagged into my hands" Interrogator: sir this is a wendys
Just name the alley Galley. Galley the alley.
2:48 "where the big bank will be"    Heh  Grian-Gotts  he heh heh
Hey grian you can build a log farm in ollivanders wand shop to match the reference picture p
Griagon alley
You should call it diamond alley
Wonk & Stonks
Grian should name the alley anom alley (anomaly)
you should make the back building like a hotel but really just your like house or something
Hermiton abbey

episode three of asking to call the alley DiaGrian alley
you should name the ally The Boston Ally or something like it
grian please name the alley balamory
You should call the alley "Die-again alley' or something like that
Flood grian with Griangotts people, this is IMPORTANT STUFF HERE
*Name it the **_Valleyway_** and add a valley into the bottom!*   Season 8 is all about puns so pun that alleyway!
I'm going to do it anyway! Famous Last Words
Griagon Alley
Call the alley “died-and-gone alley” as you keep dying
**Wonk.**
Let scar build where he wants
He should call it grimmstone alley.
G-gone alley...
maybe in the middle of the alleyway is a big fountain ⛲ behind the fountain is the bank 🏦
Please make a “GrianGrotts” bank at the end of the alley!
Grain: calls it the Alley   me: daigrian alley?
You should try to do a whole episode in an American accent
Your going to be living in scar’s basement
Name the bank in the center Griangotts?
Name idea: Orthogon Alley (as opposed to diagonally)
16:00 grians laugh was scary
Ally name idea: "The Underground Gally" The "G" for grian in Gally or just The Gally idk for me it seems like a decent name 🤔
sticking with puns perhaps you could name your base something along the lines of "5th Cavernue" cavern and avenue 5 just bc of the famous road (but maybe someone could think of something more clever)
grian! you should make a bank in the alley based off of Gringotts, but name it Griangotts
The Grian Alleyway should be called the Galleyway. Yes, I know a galley is a type of boat. That is the idea.
i was gonna call it "coppa clock" but then i realized coppa is a completley different thing
Here is a name idea: DiaGrian Alley
Wonk alley
ugh  always lag you cant get away from lag
what if boatem toll
Call the street: Succeeded Fin-Ally
This is going to be the most costly season for the boatem crew ever
The alleyway, no no no The gally
🙂
At the end of your base, you should build something along the lines of the Gringots Bank. You could put all of your diamonds in one big pile, in the most secure Minecraft bank on the server.
missingback alley  there is no back to this alley
Polygon Alley since it's Diagon Alley in a video game
You’re calling mumbo’s base the Moss chair when it should be called the Stone Throne
More wonk plz.
Alley name idea: Grian-y gully or  grainy gully
"Added a bit of wonk" XD
name it the Galley
Ware is your house
One of my favourite grian hermitcraft episodes yet :)
Hey grian did u know that when filming scenes in gringots they filmed at Australia house but in the deathly hallows they recreated the entire set :)
He has built shops on land and at sea, next season is the floating shops????
Scar basiaccly wasted 5 minuees of the episide
Or the puppy alleyway just think of something creative I’ll be fine I bet
you chould name your ally griagon ally
Well you're not using any dye to build the alley. You could call it "Dye Gone Alley"
Griagon Alley?
lo
What about... The G-Alley!
noce
I’m thinking like the shopping alleyway
Diagrian alley
Green get creative with it with the name
Lol
The alley isn't diagonal, but it is wonky...  Wonky Alley!
You should name the alleyway  Show ground alley
You should name it daegrain ally
I guess Grian owes Scar a Did You Die box. So that makes two for Scar so far this season that others have had to pay for. XD
You should name the alley way griston treet
You should name the alleyway hermit alley
What about the "Grinstone Alleyway"
Diagrian drive?
Grian, this is why we can’t have nice things.
I have an idea! What if every boatem member plays Hide 'n' Seek inside the Boatem Village!
reads title "Why haven't you put a fence around the goattom pole yet?"
Maybe JUST MAYBE fix a shulker platfrom down there with minecart chests with rockets and endepearls in it
the void should be called the bottem void
"Add some wonk"  -Grian, 2021
You should call the bank griangots instead of gringots
Town name ideas   Down Town Swirl  (Better than the Up Town Girl)  Down Town Junk (Just as good as uptown Funk)  Down Town Alley (Still better than Downton Abbey)
Grian: you don't see this much getting items back.  Also Grian getting  items back for like third time.
"this small amount of deepslate mining" me: gazes upon a cavern bigger than a naturally generated one before the caves and cliffs update
He should call the alleyway griagon alley
Since Grian keeps dying and doesn’t have a name, I suggest Die-a-lot Alley. Kinda sounds like Diagon Alley
Alley name idea: Wonking Alley
Name for the base “ wonky walks” don’t know if it’s great but something with wonk could be cool
you should call it "the bowl and ring ally"
Why not call it the cave of profit
almost at 7 mil
Silky, Silky v1.0 - v5.0 always on my silk touch picks
Grain name it "g-stone alley"
Gria-gon Alley
Why not call it the G-Alley the Galley.....for boatem lol
You sHould make the g-train into a hogwarts express train thing by adding a red engine cart in the front
I feel like the hermits are manually bringing HC s8 into 1.18.
Reposting to hope it gets seen: “Make a bank at the end of the alley called Griangotts that is where the villagers trade with tou
Put the first version of the barge on an open train car!!
Oh no I lagged and clicked the like button
If you do end up making a bank you should call it Griangots just a suggestion though.
Congrats on 6.9 million subs!
why surprised of scars starter look at scars starter in season 7
its could be called the hopquarts ally    idk    :D
6.9 mil congrats
Only 6 shulkers he says... the hermits perception of quantity is really unnatural for literally everyone else
WONK POLICE! YOU’RE BEING ARRESTED FOR SAYING “WONK” TO MANY TIME, AND I FINE OF £100
2 hours of mining got ONLY 6!!! SHULKER BOXES of deep slate
Me watching grain by myself: wholesome mine craft moments Me watching grain with my parents: ‘wonk, wonk, wonk’ *this is just a joke I really enjoy the content don’t take it the wrong way :)
Name a more iconic duo than Grian and neglecting back-end of builds
They should keep a tally of how much stuff they lose to the void
good job with the builds :)
Aly cave
Grian!! for the G train you should make a limited stock cart where every time it runs out of stock you add something that’s interesting/hard to get so people keep coming back to see what’s new
It would seem that entering the boatem hole costs a boatem toll.
You should name your base "Diagrian Alley"
you should build the Gringotts Wizarding Bank in the back
#2 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING
Build the half manshion continue the history
Perhaps you should call the street in your base wobb-alley as I twist on the words wobbly (due to its twisted shape) and it sounds like  diagon-alley
16:42  “If we go down then we go down together”
diagonal alley
You should name it griagon Ally
Grian and Mumbo "lagging" is the best conversation I saw in quite a while!
Griangotts bank…
Please build a Gringotts style bank at the end of your alley, that would be awesome!
FINISHH THE FOKEN CAVE BASE
Grian i love your base this season already I think it looks great however having the warped wood greenish building at the entrance of the cave i have to say i think looks a bit... well weird. If you were to move it inside the base and have a much more usual building at the entrance i think the build would flow much better and it would seem like you were walking into a magical place if the builds got more outlandish with strange colours such as that one the further you walked down the alley.  Please like so Grian sees this everybody!
18:37 the boatem sacrifice should be required for deals
Loving the constant uploads!
4:22 Octagon Mega Shopping Soon???
You could use amethyst in the alley roof and call it the indigo alley
NUMBER 2 TRENDING POG
Grian: for diamonds

¡Tragedia! Leonardo Farkas lo pierde todo.
Grain and Pearl and everyone else: scar build here Scar: well this spot where nobody wants me to build is great, it’s the opposite side of boatem so isn’t that nice!
It’s the batato
Season 7: the Barge Season 8: the G-Train Season 9: G-Plane???
Yeah its JUST ONLY 6 shulker boxes of STACKS of deepslate
Why not call the alley dilly'd alley because diagon alley is like diagonally and this would be like dillydally?
6.9 mil — noice
Creaky cove
hermits: not wanting to mine deep slate because it isn't insta mine   me: digs out whole chunk and 100 by 100 with stone tools and no beacon
Diagrian Alley
You could call the alley "Griagon Alley"
10:40 I don't think that looks like 'swag' HMMMMMM
if you mine for deep slate you also get diamonds but if you mine for diamonds you get very little deep slate
Grian the name for the bank should be Grian-gots bank
The ally should be named Grains ally or haunted hollow
Do Tergon Allie
Almost 7mil subs guys, subscribe to this man right here ✌️
its lag
Almost at 7 mil subscribe everyone for groans sake
Grian jumping into the hole after scar to try to save him was pure😂
For the big building at the end of that alley you should do Gringotts bank, but instead say Griangotts
Sending scar a message  Scar: turf wars PTSD
Digrian ally
How about….Mieagon Alley? or Minegone Alley?
“Two hours ONLY got me six shocker boxes of deep slate”  I’m sorry ONLY 6 shocker boxes!!!!
If it takes 5 hours to trade for both sets of armor/tools, wouldn't it be much faster to just spend around 1.5 stacks to craft everything with diamonds + buy books, and then mine to replace the diamonds which would only take like ~2 hours total?
Name it the Cavvy Way
why is the name of the ally not "the-wagon ally"??
Could call the ally; Mineagon Alley. The season seems to be all about puns this time. But obviously it’s up to you
Griagon alley?
You could name it Abnorm Alley
“I’ll do it anyway for the diamonds”  Pretty much sums up grian
one wonders where the items that are lost to the boatem hole end up once they are free from the grasp of a hermitcraft member
Horizon T. Alley
Scar and Grian both die My head: DOUBLE KILL
4:41 Grian:  look how slow this is witg efficiency V! Me with a stone pic, building my base out of deepslate:
It really should be a bank
The big bank… Gringotts
Name the alley Diamond Alley (Dye-ah-mond alley)
One thing about grians build is that he lacks interior If he makes the whole cave a base then the alley way could be the interior and no interior for the alleyway houses will be made
Name it the Gally
“I lost everything” “It’s lag”
Gotta love that sub count at the time it is 6.9
smh
6.9m subs :)
You should call the ally the “Grally” or “Gally”
1:20 Me when I realized I have to go to school in a week.
What’s with Grian and not building the back of stuff
Ideas for alley way names: Giangon alley Hermitgon alley Hermitcraft alley Boatem alley  Boatagon alley Diamond alley
Hey grain! I've been going through a lot of trouble as a result of my dads death, I hope your ok because for the fist time in a while I laughed, thank you Grian you mean so much!
It's kind of wonderful how you came up with the boatem hole and you are usually the person spending hours to replace all the stuff lost to it.  Are you regretting it yet?
Grian has more braincells than me
Call it the galleyway, a pun with Grian and alleyway, and you get to say good golly it’s the galleyway!
You should build your own version of Nocturne Alley
Grain your posting so often now! But please remember to take a break for yourself every once and a while!
lag
this was a great episode
We're not going to talk about the spelling mistake in the sky message
16:34 “Pictures taken moments before disaster”
9:24 WONK counter: 7 More wonks to come? WONK
The shop next season would be a moving moss shop that grows
Just noticed the candle next to me was lit
call the alley cobbblestone alley
im not sure grian knows "wonk" used to be a racial slur..
Grain is the best YouTuber I’ve ever seen
Tip: if you want to mine faster, get Aqua Affinity on your helmet and fill the entire room with water, then put a conduit in there. Once activated, it’ll give haste 2 along with the beacon and eff 5

Hey grian sorry to bother but what pc and screen recorder do you use?
That  laugh was the best laugh ever Call a shovel dirty digger
That's karma for you Grian instantly punished from using blackmail :p
This alleyway NEEDS a Griangotts!
Honestly I’ve dug out an entire chunk on my world and I haven’t found diamonds or deep slate, the only place I found diamonds was the Desert Temple at spawn
Maybe you could ask the HHH people if they could help you build your mountaintop?
Grian should name the alleyway "the Galley"
This ones got some WONK. This ones got some WONK. This ones got some WONK  I really like that word now. WONK

I have an idea for a name for the alley. The Giant Grian Gorge. or the GGG
GIGAGON ALLEY FOR THE BUILD
I got some diamonds off camera  *well well well*
The alleyway name : The Alleywaaaaaaaaayo the pizza here
If he doesn't complete a task by the time the copper oxidises he'll start another server wide war
I love how even stealing is friendly.
Yummy  mashed oreos (diorite) it's. My fave block, pls, don't discriminate. If you do, I make fun of you back
honestly unmade alleyway is a really fun name
Griangon alley
Am I the only one that saw shag
p
This stole #3 trending from mumbo (again) see the pun
name it giadon alley
6.9Mil
Grian, you should call it diamond ally and then store all your diamonds from the train in a vault in the bank. (just a surgestion others have probably already suggested this, plus you'll probably never see this anyway)
Name for Alley The alley cave or Cristal alley
You should name it diagonal alley
Yeah it’s only 10,300 deep slate PFFF
How about boulevard Grain
How many time should I say that I love the music
Grian i am inspired by u to build, could u make a video showing how to use the new blocks in builds and how to add diff blocks with it like for the building u have used the crimson wood and granite.....
Call the cave horizontally
The lag was so bad!!
I suggest either nocturn alley or diagon alley. Or if ur really lazy erabor.
Thanks you for putting out content groan it takes my mind of being down
The griangon ally
Harry's ally??
Grian is best minecraft build NA
Wonk alley? Alley of wonk?
You should name the ally grains underground ally town
the game when you get close to the void
When you see the amount of subs that grian has. Nice
After the events in this episode,  you should call it 'Bye Gone, Buy Gone Alley'
You could call the alley way the underground alley
why not call the alley the Galley cuz you put G on most things you branded (like The G Team) and galley just sounds like a cool word
Blockturn alley?
grian and the boatem hole is a menace to the hermits 😂😂😂😂
Since your still looking for a name, here are some suggestions: The Havoc Disarray Alley The Madhouse  Scrambles  I got these names by looking in a thesaurus! Synonyms are a great way of finding names for things
square-a-nely should be the name because it's digon ally but in minecraft
when Grian posts a video it makes my day
Your smart
the g-train is gonna be like wadzee's melon farm lol
You should name the alley either Vertic Alley or Horizont Alley
I call Grian's base Caveyway for some reason...
6.9 million subs ! Amazing!          _nice_
The boatem company should be called boatEMPORIUM
Btw I need to learn not to eat noodles and  watch you because every time I take a bite I laugh and it goes everywhere
Really
Y’all just need a set of back up stuff ready at all times lol
name it minagon alley
How am I not suprised you guys died in the void
Wait why don't you call the Alley the G-alley pronounced Jeealley?
grian you can call the ally, Gally or G-ally
You should name your base Grianonalley?
Hey grian you should make a purge day
Name idea for the base: What about the Galley?
Name the alley the gralley
Grian should make a bank called griangrotts
Grian hermitcraft season 7 stonkin this season wonkin
I’ve just realised that a grian timelapse wouldn’t be a timelapse without the epic music behind it
Does anyone know the song used in the villager time lapse? (19:09)
Gally
"G-Alley",  "Galley", or "The Galley Alley" ??
Grian technically saved scar twice if I’m not wrong. Scar‘s enderperl hit the tunnel hole and he fell onto the cobblestone bridge :D
call it the gralley
Diorite alley  Sounds like diagon check Is Minecraft based. Check Trolls someone on the server check check.
Make sure that the Bank isn't wonky, because the goblins seem too efficient to have a wonky bank, either intentionally or not.
The Alley should be named Galley-Go!
I saw a loop hole at scars 400 diamond deal: he can order anything FOR 400 diamonds
I don’t know if this is too close and simple but a possible name for the Alley could be: The Griagon Alley (as in Grian/Diagon Alley)
The alley is a finale
Name the alley 'Atmospheric Alley' like the word atmospherically because you are going for atmosphere in your base.
If he had made the alley even slightly diagonal He could have called it Diagonal Alley
How about grain alley? We shall finally know who this grain character is, they are someone involved with the alley (what part they play in it I have no idea, you can figure it out)
He should call it Griangot hollow or something lol
Make the “bank” called grian gots!
Call it Knobac alley (no back alley)
Scar just can't help killing people at the Boatem Hole
Diagrian alley
Grian's marketing strategy: sell EVERYTHING!!!, if it exists it can be profit
Grianton
Yes build a Boatem Council building!
No the alley should be called Griangon alley
Ow man lag
The think the alleyway should have the word cobble in it like the like... Not sure but... Yeah cobbler maybe?
Horizon alley (or horizont ally)
Alley…no,  it’s the Grian Crack
Name for the ally: Diagrian Ally
Call the alley DiaGrian Alley
Strawberry lace lane, also anyone else see the second reference photo and think of the shambles in York
Build an entire town on top of your bases.
Scar is definitely one of the funniest members of Hermitcraft !
press f to pay respect
Please have  gringots at the end it would look awesome you could put all your diamonds/enderchests in there
Ayyyy he's got 6,9mil subs XD
everyone be talking about how extra scar’s starter base is but does anyone remember the magical village? lmao
Grian: If you're not buying DIE!!!!! Me who is too poor to afford anything: Insert sad death sounds
8:56 minecraft building look better then real life buildings
Hey Grian! You should call the alley the Grinalleyway 😁
The ally should be the gridon alley
Man grian your laggy today  Also name the ally Vwindlespear
we didnt have efficiency or a beacon btw
You should name the ally wonky willow
Call the alley “Griangotts Alley”
i already cant stand the time lapse music
Bygone alley
You have the Gtrain so it would make since if you named the hall thing the Ghall, It would be funny/cool if you name most of your builds with G in the beginning of the word for this season.
Grian : the copper that i have been slowly accumulating   Mumbo: where did all my copper go?
Yo name your ally the Gally, becuase it's a Grian Ally and gallery. That wonk be art.
Im impressed and hate the amount of stress that whole boatem hole scene gave me, and that second grian broke the cobblestone  I knew it was there which the title would come true. Just to think scar told grian he cant get out cus he has no rockets, then forgets he doesnt have rockets when scars already a gonner. HILARIOUS!
as the cave is slanting doun make a darge for hq
Horizont Alley Vertic Alley
“I only got 6 shulker boxes full of deepslate” ONLY? ONLY? THATS SO MUTCH! (Well this is hermitcraft)
I was too straight too so I had to add some wonk into my life 😂
It would be pretty funny if the alleyway was called Horizont Alley, kinda like Diagon Alley, but it’s not diagonal, is it?
The botem hole claims more victims.
Grian give techno some clout. It’s like blood for him
After seeing what Grian did to that creeper I definitely I have to buy something and not just browse
Boatmum bankkk!!
Wonk
me and my friend spent 3 hours mining deepslate and another 2 hours mining coal to smelt it and we smelted about 15 stacks of it to build a base. turns out you can only use *cobbled* deepslate in a stonecutter, and not regular deepslate.
GRIAGON ALLEY WILL BE THE NAME
You could call it Ally mountain
LOL Deesplate being more expensive than cobbled deepslate is such a joke. Only bigger joke is how useless silk deepslate is. Imagine, buying deepslate so you can mine it all again without silk and finally get a decent block.
simply, "The Gralley"
I too have to re-activate my two  braincells to spell
3 diamonds a stack
he should bring back poultry man.
You should name the alleyway “Axolotl Alleyway” and make an axolotl on the bank because of 1.17
You could call it under rock alley
Griagon Alley
Can’t wait for lifles to make a death to boatem hole death compilation
Diagrian alley
I feel the Deepslate grinding struggle. I'm the one who sells it, within the shopping district on an SMP with my friends, and it takes forever to gather. I sell it for around 3 stacks per diamond-- have I been underpricing it that much? Haha.
Name it diamond alley then have a diamond tree at the end of the alley
Diagrian alley
*Diagrianalley* How about that?
DiaGrian alley
Hey grian I recommend that you should make ine building and an alley way between two houses to serve as like a garbage area for dumpsters and stuff
you should name the ally diagon ally but with grain so diagrain ally
6:22 Your logic doesn't make sense if you make a lot of diamonds when digging up deepslate you would be making more profit by selling it as well
Could you stop losing everyting  FOR FIVE MINUTES.jpg
Nobody sub he’s at 6.9 mil
the alleyway has been unnamed for too long. saying it is unnamed is wrong, because it has a name, "the alleyway". bonus points: if someone doesn't know what you're talking about, it's extra ominous.
I feel bad that it is deepslate and not cobbled deep slate
19:06 the song lol 🤣
I have a idea for a shop, It is a sort of shopping centre where other hermits pay a fee for a certain amount of space here to make a shop, what’s different about this is that at the start you make give 1000 custom items used as currency to each hermit, this item is useless outside of your shop but like liquid gold inside as there is a unchanging amount of money, to get you a profit in diamonds you could make a “for every 100 items sold, you are payed one diamond, I think this could be fun for both the audience and the hermits, also shopping wars
Once you put the mountain on, you should put in some grey stained glass at the top as smoke because of the chimney.
“ONLY six shucker boxes of deep slate” - Grian
ally of G
I can't believe that lag. Super crazy, right guys?
If you want large amounts of deep slate, build a tunnel bore and collect the blocks it blows up. It also gives you diamonds and other resources
Bet you wont name the shovel “Slade”
Alley name idea: The Galley
I name the alley, the Wolley! Wonky + Alley (:
"deepslate is not fun to get" Me who mined 60 shulker boxes of it with iron pickaxes: First time?
Day a bunch of ask if you don’t already have a name for the alley you should name it Punagon alley It’s like diagon alley but the season of puns style
Call the alley 'DiaGrian Alley'
Gri-a-gon alley
See what your mischievous deeds have gotten u into grian u better be careful or else the watchers will come back
I love how they all agreed making a hole into the void was a good idea and it's already claimed four inventories worth of gear
Thats a waaaay too cheap deepslate youve got there
Doesn't Scar said hi wish to do a floating base in the sky? Just thinking ...
Wonky Way, maybe?
Looks at the amount of subs Grian has: nice
i have an idea for a name for the alley, deep alley
Dia-Grian Alley
Scar's karma Scarma
I need deepslate for a mega base in my single player world  And I don't have a beacon or efficiency V😐
What about boatem ally
What if you named the alley The Gralley
Griagon Alley
Every time Scar dies in Grians presence I swear Grian has 3rd life ptsd flashbacks. XD
make the villager place look better
Griangon alley
Grian you are an amazing builder, so please I am begging you to fix your mountain
You should name the alley way “galley way”
You should call the alleyway G Street.
We have mumbo who only made a tiny car and then we have scar
THE HAT DIED
You should sell the buildings in the alleyway to the other hermitcrafters and they could put shops in them
Please make the back building "Griangotts"
griagonal alley
I think grian should name the bank blue intestines in honor of green gots
It's beautiful knowing that in hermitcraft you can leave a chest with 1 stack of Diamond Blocks and anybody is going to steal It.
i actually like the unnamed ally way as the name! i think it’s funny and fits a bit with all the funny shop and base names :)
grain , d'boatem hole was yer idea . don soem in storm  edit : every wrong grammar and so was intended
How about naming it the DillydAlley?
Get Mumbo a nether star so he stops stealing your beacon lol
It will then be a villager trading room and storage
The botem hole was such a hilariously bad, good idea
You should totally name the alleway: Grain Street lol
Diagrian Alley
How about "Wonk-alley"XD
Down way alleyway 😎
The ally should be called The  Grially ally (Grian’s vally ally)
Wonk Alley
Make your mountain look like pearls
Sorry Iskall. Diorite Alley could be a fun name. It's close to Diagon but it's the best I can think of at the moment lol
f
The "Galley" is looking good so far!
That’s why you have corus fruit on 2b2t
The alley should be called griangot alley
GRAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIINNNNNNNNN
He is power. He is wraith. He is evil. He is Grian.
What if the alley way is the way to get to the shopping area
Big bank at the end of your ally? Like Griangotts? See what I did there.
Boat smoke ally
Pls call the ally diagonal ally
Scar: "What point do I break it to ya. I had a trident on me" Grian: " *oh no* "
yo
Am i just seeing things or did scar almost broke bedrock on 15:04 with a pic
You should name it horizont alley
Lol next thing you know green has rubbed off with everyone in hermit craft with the castle in season seven and everyone won’t have a back of their base
It's an Askew Alley!
Grian if you are going to add wonk to your buildings you should name the alleyway. The Wonky Alleyway
The big build at the end of the alley should be a bank so it can be called Grian-gotts Bank, like a pun on Gringotts Bank. It would be funny.
Next season grain has to make an aeroplane shop so water ground air build from the ground up
Has anyone suggested name name "Vertic Alley?"
Grian using a diamond pick on deepslate- Look at how long this takes!  Me, still using the iron pick with no enchantments- :l   ok. Also grian- In two hours, only SIX shulkers.  Me agian- :/ ok
you should call  your base "Grian's Grotto"
So, in season 10, will Grian and Mumbo actually finish the back of their bases?
Hear me out. Griagon Alley. Like diagon alley. But Grian
6.9 Million subs nice grian.. NOICE
The alley should be Horizonally
Grian everytime you upload it makes me really excited you are such a wholesome youtuber!!
Call the ally Grove St
Since you were inspired by Diagon Alley (Diagonally)  Could go the synonym route! Oblique Alley? (Obliquely)
Grian you should make a traintrack down to your emerald farm like in the gringots bank
“Grian” oh no your stuff went in my inventory  “Grian” I don’t want to do a order “Scar” I have 400 diamonds
Diagon alley
My guy, put Fred and George’s joke shop at the back of the cave, it would look so good
Maybe the Alley should be called Orthongon Alley, like how Diagon is a play on words of diagonal, orthagon is a play on words of orthogonal(90° angles)
it should be called 'polygonalley', since blocks are polygons
I think that you could use your mines of deep slate for some progect.
Horizontal Hallway
For the diamonds!  -grian 2021
name the bank at the end of the alley “Grian-gots”
Grian: I picked up a little bit of diamonds off camera. Me: OH NO ITS TOO LATE HES THE RICHEST AGAIN
How about griagon alley
It lagged
Gria-gon alley
You could name the alley The Wobb-Alley!! Like wobbly but mixed with alley…. because the buildings are wonky and like that could kinda be like wobbly… I dunno.
Hear me out. DiaGrain alley. If it's based off of diagon alley
grian please work on the interior in the alleyway buildings  plss!!!
You forgot something: Scar‘s idea for this seasons base is a floating city in the sky.
"I'm just going to call it the alley for now"  So if this ends up following your usual naming patterns it's going to be called something like the G-Alley isnt it. the Galley. The Galleyway  lmao
You should all put heads on your mountains like mt Rushmore
Or what about calling the alley THE GRIAGON ALLEY
What about the name boatem hall?
Wonky donkey ally
Between you and Mumbo’s giga bases, you could build The Argonath from Lord of the Rings. It’s the two statues on each side of the River Anduin.
When I’m watching this he has 6.9 mil subs and 69k likes
“The mystic Ally way” perhaps
How about Vertic Alley, like Diagon Alley but caves and cliffs
If You can't think of something to put in the center of your base just put a shop. (Barge 2.0) it's a shop for hermits and a building for your base. Solved?.?
Griagon alley
Name suggestion for the alley: Spiritu Alley
WONKY
nope its a cloud base.  so ya get to building your mountain :(
69k likes pog
How about diamond alley kinda like diagon alley but you pronounce the diamond like diagon (die-a-maund)
I think Grigonally would be a potential name
make Griangotts
is life too bland? Try WONK
He should name the alleyway “diagrian alley” or something like that
I saw Grian die in chat on Bdubs stream and thought it was a meeting oh wow how I was wrong. great video Grian !!!
So I don’t know if grian realizes but scars building a floating city not a mount Olympus
6.9M subs, nice
Good
Is the G-Train going to be getting a Engine?
If there will be a bank, then call it the Big Bank of MONEY
The grally
You could make a building out of copper instead of the copper dam
Karma strikes again
I still like Griagon Alley
Has anyone suggested Griagon Alley yet? Lol
6.9subs:)
The "Grianon alley"
Mabey the aly way should be called the Grian way.
the boatem hole is going to cause more deaths on the server than anything else
pretty soon the whole server is gonna be in anarchy over the "lag"
“I have to activate my two brain cells to remember how to spell things.”  “Apart from breaking my neck, what are we doing today?”  “I just- have add some- wOnK- do my builds.”
Minegon alley
Grian make the building at the end of the ally way a museum of all your past bases
This boatem hole has eaten more items than the chest monster can hold. Holy
69k Likes, 6.9 Million Subs
The GallyAlleyway sounds nice as it rhymes with the GTrian.
If i had a nickel for everytime grian fell in the void this season id have 2 nickels
LAG
"Griangotts"
I got an idea for a name for the ally way.          The Grally Way
Perhaps you could make boatem hq at the end of the alley?
Grian has 6.9 subs
You should make the gringots bank with the minecarts and vaults and maybe you could make it a game like the one from season 7
Grian, you need to make a station for the G-Train with a name something like 'Platform 10 and 3/4'
I was like “ he just killed a creeper”! Then I was like oh wait he is not mumbo.
The Griagon Alley (like the diagon alley but with grian)
Grianog ally
16:48 two idiots 🤣
Isn’t this like the third time?
What about a city hall at the back of the ally instead of a bank? Please like if you think grian should do this so he'll see it
With as many times people have lost all their stuff in the boatem hole alone, I think it's time to just cover the hole at the top or the point just before the void.
ally name: Deepslate dark
"The Wizardly Wonkway."
hi mon
you guys should add a gravestone mod to the server, you already have morpheus on it so i know its running on forge, it would really help
E
Grian, for the G-train have you considered selling a cart spot to the other hermits and take a percentage of the profits? P.S. Maybe you can have train stations across the world.
9:57 grains laugh is so adorable
6.9mill
By the way, congrats on 6.9 million subs! lol
What is the song in 19:07 ?
I GOT IT, VERTICALLY 👌🤣
Grain, why not name it “DiaGRAIN Alley”?
Why not name the Ally, Grally? Duck it, It's Grally.
You should call it the “galley”
Honestly pretty selfish getting scar to build your own base
Anyone think that “diagrian alley” would be a good name for the base
I'm not a builder but what if you make something that looks like crystal's in the cave so you can use those for lighting instead of torch spam
Every time Scar is in the Boatem-hole there will be a death involved.
i men build the titanic
Why not name the alley "Dia-Grian Alley" as a play on Diagon Alley?
6.9m subs gang?
Grian:"deepslate takes so long to mine, even with efficiency 5", me who mined stacks of deepslate with only iron pickaxes....
Groan u know what would be a good idea when u finish the mountain. Make ur head mumbos head scars head and impulses head carved into the mountain it will look cool
Willywonkway Diagrian Alley  So many names
No back alley
Maybe the alley could be called Di-eggon alley for the egg
6.9 M subs. Nice
"The GrianWitch Alley" silly I know😂
I don’t understand the purpose of the copper dam. It makes it go so slowly
W A L C C   L I K E   D A   F U R R E T
I like your time laps music
6.9 mil congrats
I can't believe you had a second chance on the puns and still didn't use "We won't pick on you" for the pickaxe
You have boatam a cliff maybe even a cave you can boatam a goatam or boatam a tree you can boatam a hole maybe even add a pole you can boatam an tegg or boatam an train and boatam an empire but you can boatam my hear and many others to
Scar: takes more than 1 day to build a megabase  Grian:well now that won't do!
4:15 mr G became eminem for a second
Boatem hole probably is the best diamond-sink on the server XD
Minecraft: a nice peaceful farming building game  Hermitcraft: *exists*  Also Minecraft: ECONOMY, NOW
Like Fernando Alonso said "Karma"
Sally the Alley
No! Don't blame me for this!
The alley could be Griangon Alley
And this my friends is why you don’t build giant holes into the void in the middle of your base
Grian, you idiot! Why'd you ever think the Boatem Hole was a good idea? Is your brain always lagging or something?
6.9 milion subs XD
The Mountain Alley can be the name
Make a dobee
beild the titanic
Wow, I just noticed the amount of subscribers grian has is sus. If you know you know. ;)
Grian at the end of the alley u should build a neighborhood and the houses are for villagers to trade with!
I've been cleaning my room all day and I am soooooo glad there's an episode out. GO GRIAN
Wonk Alley sounds chaotic for the name 😂
name it g town
Scar: *gets trapped in a hole Grian: It puts the base on the mountain or else it gets the hose again
The alley should be called diagrian alley
Second time I've seen something named scar push something off a cliff
you can call the alleyway "the gralleyway" or "the gralley" idk i just really like it
a million hours is more than a lifetime
idea for the alley way: Vertica alley
I can't unseen a moss chair
name for then ally id maintin ally
day 2 of asking grain to call it the grainbread alley
Diagonal-ally
Scar: can you throw me an ender pearl. me: oh please say grian isn't gonna THROW an ender pearl. *grian doesn't* me: thank goodness. *me continues watching* *they both die* me: well Sugar.
I guess karma is a very cruel thing to get, 17:02 when you made the deal with scar to build above your base🤣 after letting him out of the bedrock.  I guess the Minecraft God said nope you've made a bad deal 🤣🤣. I guess you'll never make that deal ever again. But it was sure funny watching scar plead for an ender pearl to get out. A better way of copper oxidizing is to spread it out four blocks or just in general spread it out not to build a wall with it that's what the other hermits have been doing.
Trigonally??
You should name the ally hermit ally
Floating candles?
You should call it boatem way
I think the cyan tower at the start of the alley doesn't really match with the others
If someone like me who dosent mind mineing Stone with iron pickaxes without efficiency 5 nor a beacon would join this server they could make Mole Man industries with the slogan "I'm the Mole who will mine what you wont!" lol
Pun 13:29 hole-d on
Doesn't scar owe you a full gear set from killing you?
Grian is pearlescentmooni Australian
If you mine for deepslate you get the value of the diamonds in ADDITION to the re-sell value of the deepslate you collect. If you just mined for 2hrs, you'd make half the diamonds in the end.
I now really think you should call it Griagon Alley.
Scar: I used my last rocket Grian 5 mins later hitting him into the hole: Im going to pretend I didn't hear that
GRIAN I HAVE A GOOD NAME FOR THE ALLEY WAY “Diagonal Alley” I know its genius, but of course it would have to be at more of an angle
Grian you should build hogwarts on top of your cave!!
Scar woud sell the deep for 6 dias
The building recipe for the Tower of Pisa, the last ingredient it 1/3 Wonk, or tilt if you can't provide wonk.
7:50 Someone make this moment into an animatic
Name the alley “The Galley”
call it the galley (grian + alley)
if impulse really wanted to be in charge of happiness he could have done customer service and health and resources then he would be in charge of the happiness of the customers and the employees
Hear me out on this one ok G:  "Wonky Wally"  It fit's perfectly!
Wonki alley
I vote that you should build the Weasley‘s house on the top or hogwarts
I love some wonk in builds
Grian being the cause of one of scars deaths and feels bad about it It’s third life all over again
horizont-alley
Diagrian alleyway
Boatem should really consider why they have a large hole to the void... just sayin'
u should remake gringotts wizard bank at the back it would look epic
Les goo
Boatem Alley !
Lucky number 13
You guys need to invite shulkercraft to hermitcraft
Diagrian Alley
Copper oxidates faster if you space them out
call the Alleyway    ... Ali-A hahaha funny
You could call it poultry lane and in one of the shops show poultry man’s outfit @Grian
You should call it diagonal ally like diagon ally but diagonal
What about something like Wobb Alley (wobbly)?
maybe the horizant alley or vertic alley (like diagon alley but different)
Creavis cavern
The boatem hole is gonna be richer than most of the hermits by the end of the season
Griangon ally anyone?
Grian has done a great job with the alley so far its really beautiful ❤️
Ironically, I also lost everything in minecraft today, went on a hunt for an elytra in my current world and of course how else, as soon as I see the ship I fall into the void and miss my pearl
Can I hire you to build a house in my world
I want a count on how many lifes the botem hole has consumed by the end of the season
To get rid of the snow on your mountain, you should try using stone pressure plates
It’s a ranbow ally
"Look at how long it takes to mine this!" **takes less time than me mining plain stone**
I can’t wait to see the giga base complete
Arigon Alley? (based loosely off Diagon Alley)
Next season, your Mega Base should consist of a 360 degree build so you have to build the back of everything :P
Lol Scar bulk ordering perish parcels.
remember when scar said ender pearls are for nerd... lol
The Wonky Galley perhaps?
Make a building out of diamonds
Griagon Alley maybe...  Edit: Also, the building that curves in the back could be a reference to Gringots Bank and can be where your storage system is
Boatem ally
Slant street?
name it something in reference to diagon alley
Grian should make a beacon lending service
Make a bank called griangotts please
Griagon Alley
Call it Griagonalley
You should make “Green”gots (Or Griangotts) at the end of the alley, where the villagers give you Emeralds
scar: you can't just leave a man in a hole like this.         single handedly the best scar line ever
How the hell does this keep happening GRIAN SCAR YYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Buyapun Alley
The question when selling deepslate is not "Are people gonna buy it?", but rather "How often do I want to have to restock?"
Grian should make the middle building out of quarts
The ally could be called the gally
Wonk
Grian, “This 2 hour mining session only got me 6 shucker boxes of deep slate.” Me, “PLZ I’VE BEEN MINING FOR 8 HOURS STRAIGHT AND I HAVE 13 DEEP SLATE!!! WHY!!!!!!!!!!!”
15:00-15:05  somewhere around this time scar broke bedrock wtf
I’m loving the consistent often uploads
Stuff-a-gon alley
Recommendation for the ally name, "grain-again ally!" Keep the grain jokes flowing and since it's mainly FARMS, grain = wheat = farm = funny joke. Idk. Just an idea.
no grian scar wants to bild a cloud
make a hour glass of copper blocks and move the oxidized copper to the bottom
Wonk meaning: a person who takes an enthusiastic or excessive interest in the specialized details of a particular subject or field, especially political policy.
That was karma there. When you lost all your stuff
“I need to activate my two brain cells to remember how to write” barely a minute and a half in and it’s one of the most relatable things ever
Diagrian alley
You could call your alley Horizont Alley, like how Diagon Alley is diagonally
True friendship falling for a friend 😂😂😂
petition to call it Diegon Illey?
Griagon Alley?
Jesus loves you. He died on a cross to prove it. Repent to him today!
You should call the ally the grally??!
How bout Willy wonkway
Plz the minegon ally
"You can purchuse one at the swaggon" - A man with a lot of luck
You should call it Diagon alley
Scar you could name your cave base something like wonk lane or wonk alleyway. Anything to with wonk seems good.
I got a name suggestion. ‘Boggart Ballet’ or BB.
instead of calling it Diagon Alley.diagonally vayagonally.vertical Diagon Alley is it diagonal and vayagonally is vertical.
How about waffle head alley?
Since the alley's not diagonal call it "parallel alley"
is it just me or do the inspiration pictures look nothing like the builds???
with the building that is like olivenders  i think i spell it wrong but but sticks in it
Grian: deepslate takes too long to mine. It take a second to get a block of deepslate Me in my new Minecraft world: I HAVE TO MINE IT WITH AN IRON PICK BECAUSE I NEED IT FOR MY BASE
it would be cool if be cool if the boatem of the alley went down to bedrock!  Boatem ally black market!
Grian: sells deep slate Also grian: I got more diamonds out of this mining session then I will from selling what I mined
I have a Name idea for the Allyway: Boatem Boulevard. I think it sounds very nice
Since the theme of the alley is wonk, why not name it wonk-alley?
Call it the hermit alley
I know what you make is essentially kid's content, but I love it so much. Full of creativity when it comes to aesthetics and activities. Everything is so bright and fun, easy to follow along with. I never really feel like I'm too old to watch this, because even if the main audience is kids, you don't dumb down anything or treat the viewers like they're idiots. I love your content!
*Netflix show exists* Netflix: these two were actually a bit too straight
What if you call your town “The Galley”?
has to be the bank at the end at it has to be "griangotts"
The G way
call your alleway GRIADON ALLEY
the galley
Next season… THE G PLANE
it was just a parank
Diagon alley much?
i think The Grambles is a good name for the alley
Ah yes a line i use far too often  “It’s too straight”
How many times is the Boatem Hole gonna eat Boatem Peoples items lol
You should make the building at the end the Boatem City Hall
*Call it walky wonka*
Obviously it should be called “The Galley”
Is "Yakety Sax" actually still copyrighted?  I guess not until 2063.  Eh...close enough.
Damn that lag
You should call the alleyway horizont ally
What if you lit it using floating candles?
I’m just curious, why do you build your builds layer by layer or so? Do you use a schematic mod or do I just not know the best method for building?
It's only fair that the two of you died together
They should add another enchantment called “Deepslate Digs” that lets you mine deepslate faster so when you use beacons it lines instantly
15:08 Is desperation making Scar mine through that block of bedrock ?
Why is he so flighty about referencing Diagon Alley? He seems to be purposefully avoiding it
Since you keep losing stuff, call the alley “Died-and-gone Alley”
Ngl grain has a nice sub count 6,9m
name for the alley..................vertic-alley?  (yes stolen from misfits and magic but still good)
The unsmelted copper block looks good as a roof
Could you change the time lapse music?
Yo this is the 6.9 million special
You did say we were going to watch scar  mes it up... but little did you know.
Grian you should name the alley the GralleyWay
Hey grian nice amount of subs ;)
UN FUN
You should call the alley griagon alley because your inspiration was diagon alley
How about if you use a netherite pickaxe?
You should call the alley “igpay alleyway” because it is a pun of pig Latin IN pig Latin and this season seems to have a lot of puns
Leave Scar alone and let him Choose for him self
You should call it crooks ally cause everything is crooked
I love how grian cut the vid when he was typing definitely, probably to google how to spell it 😂
what if scar made a giant blimp that picked up giant boulders from the mountains and took them to impulses build to like exgavate gems out of the rock
When is 3rd life starting again
Wonkalley
GRIANGOTTS
10:22 tho 2023 Mar 9: why did I write this
Wonk
It could be called madness mountain
i just realized i was on zombiecleos stream when the "lag" happened thats halarious
16:41 it was just a prank?
CALL IT GRIGON ALLEY!! Pronounced (gr”eye”gon)
The alleyway should be called die-again-alley (Original idea by Liime)
Grian, why don't you replicate the Season 7 Town Hall for the end of the alleyway!
You should call it "graially"
The Wonk Alley or The Vertic Alley
Grian. You're making diagon alley. Accept it and move on
To be fair, the deal should have been voided when they LITERALLY FELL INTO THE VOID
How about parallalley as in parallel alley idk maybe needs some work
the ally needs to be called grain st or grain way something like that
Please build a bank called ‘Griangotts’ I beg of you
Call the alleyway Cavern Avenue
Grain haters be like:  G-  *LAME*
Grians. Great. Alleyway .
You should make the end griangots and have your storage system in it
GRIANGOTTS COMING SOON YAY
The Gallyway?
He should name the alleyway the Galleyway
If you called it Wonk alley it would be like Wonkily?
I literally love how Mumbo and Grian just openly steal from each other and don’t even care!!!
How about naming it “The Boatimes Square” seems fitting for Boatem
Grians Copper dame is Mumbos Base Heart of S7
If you are thinking of a name maybe Griagon Alley? its a mix of Diagon and Grian or maybe Boatagon alley as a reference to the boatem community.
When grian shouted scar at 13:58 I genuinely got lion King vibes
Great episode!
Instead of Die a gone alley how about Live a stay road
Wink Wonk Wank Woonk
NAH NAME THE ALLEY "Ali-A"
Hahahhahahhahahaaahaahhaahahahahahahahahahaahaahhaaaahhaahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaahhahahahahahahahaahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaahahahaahahaaahaahahahaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhaaaahahahaaaahahaahhaahhahahaahhaaahhahahhaahaaaahhahaaaaaahahahahahahaha!!!
Dear god Grian why
YEEE
That hole causes more damage than all the wars in hermicraft combined
Call the alley, the galley
You can probably call the alleyway the bat cave tbh
Hardcore players who benn playing on their world for years: You call that losing everything.
I laughed so much in this episode you might just be ma favourite hermit because I look forward to all your episodes
Grian call the alley the Shaley Alley
"Just add a little wonk"
Please build ⏃ griangotts to store your diamonds!
That was some swift karma there
Call it "griagon Alley" please!!!!
“SCAR, YOU ARE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE!” he sounds like candace from phineas and ferb LMAO
You can call it the Galley (G-Alley) Just sound good.
Grian make statue of liberty
i think it would be cool if you built an actual copper dam there eventually (obviously a bit more intricate than just a wall of blocks) with a river/lake from pearl's mountain
SHAG
It would have been tri dent in my wallet after this
Move every villager needed for the boxes to a single wall or maybe a point where you can access them all without moving and a chest with other emeralds too
Grian: this would be more secret if your base had a back Me: flashback from season 7 mantion
This was the worst rescue Mission in history, maybe ever.
Also call the alley griagon alley
6.9 million subscribers, 6.9 thousand comments. Noice
The alley should be called “Diamond Block Alley”
call it the Grion Alley
RISE THE PRICE OF DEEP SLATE!!! Your the only seller so cheap prices are bad business
BEST ALLEYWAY NAME EVER: GRIAGON ALLEY
Diagrian Alley! (pls like so Grian sees)
The ally could be the street/alley that should not be named
7:55 Nice Crit
15:05 IS THAT BEDROCK BREAKING?
U can build the bank from hary potter as  your storage
i mined an entire chunk with just iron pickaxes, my pain tolerance is infinite
They are fighting for one of the Dumbest Hermits  No offense to scar
Deepslate is a fantastic looking block, in all its forms. Does having netherite affect the mining speed enough to be worth upgrading?
It’s weird because I’ve been to the Warner bros studio and the place in York and it’s so odd but great
Call the ally the wonkyway
(The deep way alleyway) ;) good name huh 😊😉
I hate lag to
Why does grian play Minecraft he would be an amazing business man
9:38                  that's what she said
Grain, you’re a good youtuber, but please, the way you use fireworks extremely annoying! PLEASE!!!
“Help step-Grian, I’m stuck!”
You should make griangotts bank Or diagrian alley
GRIAN I HAVE A G-TRAIN IDEA! make the deepslate cart a limited time cart.
Pls griagon ally
How about Intern Alley?
you should build gringotts bank at the end of the alley, in which you could have your storage system going deep underground + you could have a vault with your valuables and a good old pile of diamond blocks, which you will of course recieve through th G-train. i think that would be nifty
Griagon alley :O :O :O :O
It would be the wonk alley
Every time Grian replaces the copper wall he should cut out or build a number on it. See how many walls of copper it takes to finally build the train depot.
I have a good name the WONK-A alyway
"The grianway" that sounds good I think ^^ if u agree just like if not then comment  also grian if u see this hii! I'm a big fan!
6.9 million subscribers… noice
u kill somthin
As soon as it cut to Grian and Scar near the boatem void I was pretty sure this was how Grian lost everything(again).
does copper oxidice faster with water?
I believe Grian didn't think the name "booties" through
Oh no no no no no
For the next meeting you should make it that when they have a bad idea the floor under them gives and they fall into the hole
who bets that all the deepslate will be bought out by next video?
Name the ally the grally grian-ally
Gralley way
Coming from the jumbo hermit craft.. its crazy to see someone actually killing mobs
POV: you pin this
Ally name: The Grally
Build a tunnel bore
Dia-Grian alley
elaborate and obvious (clear) are 2 very very different things G
Can we get a counter for anytime grian directly or indirectly killed scar?
if only he built all of these buildings at an angle  it would be "diagonal alley"
If you go any slower on this build, you're gonna have to call it "EventuAlly"
I think you ought to name it “Dadgum Alley”, because it is so close to Diagon Alley, and it’s funny.
Diagrain ally
I definitely see that as Grigon Alley
2 diamonds per stack of cobble deepslate is actually cheap IMHO
Hermagon Alley. Change my mind
should make a gringotts styled bank with a dragon in the basement
When will it stop, next episode r.i.p
My Grandma died, today, and this was just the thing to cheer me up, a little  Thank you, so much Grian  😌
The large building at the back should be barge2.0
The ally should be called grianton the a is silent so grinton
Alley name idea: Tilted _________.  Maybe Tilted Alley
I liked the "Intern Alley" someone suggested a while back. It's a play on internally and it's inside a mountain, since Diagon Ally is a play on diagonally.
"No one wants to collect deepslate"  **Happy diorite noises**  "So we will collect it"  **Sad diorite noises**
Call it diagon alley
There should be a custom death message data pack for the boat em hole
call it the back al
At 2:54 it sounds like Grian said something bad.
grain has at this point 6.9 subs
You should call it Vertic Alley to speak to the build drawing the eyes up and being erected in the cave. Also a nod to the inspiration you used for the build. Great job Grian!
Grian: We're going to send scar a message  *flashbacks to the mycelium war*
Base a shop off Weasley Wizard Wheezes, but call it Grian Giggles at Gumbo
Grian. I don't want to be rude but the outside of your cave looks... Wel not good. It just looks like bubbly stone, if i was you i would or go something like pearl or something in the style of point mountains, maybe you could include the stalagmites. But please work on the outside, and if your putting this off that's ok so take your time.
Grian, that interaction with Scar was pure gold to watch.
should've called it tri dent in my wallet
The hermets should do something with the end.
there a lot of lag tooday
You see, this is why I call it sleepslate
Grian mining deepslate in less than a second “look at how slow this is!”
Grain you should call it grainagon ally
Bruh normally in hermitcraft seasons I end up watching half way through because I get bored of the beginning I cannot get enough of this season from all the members
Hey, I have a good idea for a name. "Blockturn Ally"
Who wants the g train to transform to the g mech
The concel or something pit gringotts there (and call it griangotts)
Hermit Hall?
pearlescent: *makes a sign that clearly says shag*   grian: s h a c k
Congrats on 6.9 million 🙃
You should name then Alley, Galley. G for Grian alley for representative reasons and galley Because ships are cool
you should call the alleyway wonk
Am I the only one that realized grian named sars sword “subscribe to grian”
Name for ally: Grally - . Grian ally..?
Grain think of it this way: you spent two hours mining for diamonds, got nearly two stacks AND you get too sell the rest of the junk for even more diamonds
I really hope Mojang allows deepslate to be insta-mined in the future; maybe by haste 2 + a netherite pickaxe with efficiency 5?
He is doing a sky base
You should make a bank in the back called "Grian"gots.
Bdubs has a deepslate store!
the alley strangely reminds me of the lego modular buildings, that can be put together in a different order and stuff, very cool
Why not name it (Diagon alley)
I've got a name DIAGRIAN ALLEY
Grain: "only six boxes of deepslate"  me: ONLY SIX?!?!?!
I can’t wait for the opocolips!
Grain be like:I don’t what to make a mega base I what to make a giga base
Fun fact: the average person has 5 trillion brain cells, not 2
In the Alley Way you should have some sort of bridge as a scenic area near the middle of the alley. It would almost be like some sort of aqueduct and you could access it from both sides of the alley. (it would be perpendicular to the alley street)
You should call your base “Griagon Alley”
DeepAlley, because of pavement made from deepslate and this alley is under a mountain... so it's deep
Name it greengon Ali
Call it Glane
i need help i was turning up attenuation on discord and now I turned it down and I can no longer hear any audio pls help anyone that knows
you can make gringots like bank with lots of villigers and put egg to represent dragon that protects gringors
Nice
I made 3 backup sets of fully enchanted neatherite and a sword Incase I die with my third set of neatherite, I have a backup, and just one of theme, no pick, shovel or anything, takes days
Name for alley: grianzy alley. Grian + crazy alley
Gringots bank should go at the end of the alley
Nice sub count
I think this has possibly been one of the best hermitcraft episodes grian has made so far - the section with scar had me in tears it was so funny!🤣🤣🤣
6.9 mil subscribers😂 close to 7 mil!
You should call it:”The diverse alley”
Should be called Griangon ally
18:10
Grian falling in the hole is just a regular thing now
Gally
Grians war chant “ for the diomands “
I would have named it tri dent in my finances
Call the alleyway the "Ali-wAy"
At the end of the ally, you should call the bank “griangotts”
What instant karma looks like with grian and scar!!! LOLL
The most hermitcraft quote ever "only 6 shulker boxes of deepslate"
Congrats gang number three on trending
U can have the back off the base to be a G-train station 🚉
When he instamined stone then compared it to deepslate I literally gagged
The bank in the alley way has to be called Griangotts right?
Wonk...
Can we talk about how Grian has 6,9 Million (nice) subscriber
Mombo always steeling some stuff on your house
Grianan Alley
Starting to think this is all part of Grian's secret plan to sell more Perish Parcels...
adding this much wonk makes you a top class wonker
Pay scar to build there
the alley should be called vertic alley. cause its like diagon alley... but not
The ally should be named trimbleton don’t ask y
Make a shirt that says it was the lag
I think the g train should be called the hermit expressway
10:43 - Ayo ??
8:08 G-Train merch when?
How about diagrain ally
You should call the alley way  bloody mumbo
The bank or whatever better have a dragon
You need to make a potion shop in the alleyway, it perfectly fits in the theme
Griagon Alley
Nice sub count 🤣
21:27 The fact that this sentence came from that specific person who started about 98% of the Hermitcraft wars scares me more than it should.
Name the alley the ‘grially’
please don't say I'm the only one who vibes to the time lapse music
when he screams scarrr on min 13:57  gave me lion king vibes
The gralleyway
you shpuld call the alley the gralley (grian + alley)
Griagon Alley
I think it’d be amazing to reference the one picutre where the black house is next to the pink house lmao
The Boatem Hole has eaten again!!
Deep slate alleyway B)
Grian is at 6.9 mill. Noice
you could call the alley wonky way
call it the grali
Griaghans ally
Grian u can call your ally grially gri-ally
13hour commet
Grain pleaseeeeee make the floating candles from Hogwarts around the top of the ally. It would look so good. Especially with a black roof. Just an idea
Love how everyone hates collecting deepslate and I’m just here like MUCH BETTER THAN COBBLE OR ANDESITE OR DIORITE
me: dirt hut = starter base Scar: i need a wagon so long it wont fit in render distance as a starter base
Name suggestion: “Bread Alley”
The alley should be called "horizont-alley". Just an idea.
Make the alley a place we’re people can open up shops but you charge them 1 diamond per (insert time frame here).
Good name the wonky ally
Agriculture-Alley...in short Culuralley...if you put in a hermit museum as well....
Grian, if you space out the copper blocks they will oxidize faster since all sides are exposed. But just leave it like that if you’re using it as a way to show how much time has passed lol
You should make a train car that has an aquarium in it, and in that, a mini barge.
I someone blows up or falls in the void then it’s boatem
Boatem alley
Oh I’m glad you posted today, I really needed it. Thank you.
wonkalley
I like how Grian is making use of almost every 1.17 block
Lesson learned: when a man asks for an ender pearl, *give him 2*
I wouldn't feel bad about charging so much for deepslate Grian.  Ease of crafting/farming should effect the price.   To be fair, Scar walked off the edge before you broke the block he was standing on.  I mean, I know he's Scar, but who walks around the edge of a hole without rockets or crouching? lol
Anyone else kinda miss the season 7 time-lapse music
you should put the bardge in the allyway
Grians at 6.9 million subscribers. Nice
Add a Fred and George (joke shop) based one (building)
Pepega brains
Blockton Alley
I ship scarin!!!!! (Or griar or whatever you wanna call the ship lol)
6.9 million followers nice
missed such a good oppurtunity with the trident, "i cant belive uve done this" in a posch accent wouldve been spectacularly awesome, anyway always a great episode with blunders from multiple parts
Grian, the king of shenanigans
7 mill ?
I-    the scar and grian duo always make me laugh 10/10 👏  And then mumbo is just there lmao lagging
Why did he do the barge dirty like that 😞
call the ally 'The Grain Way
*wonk*
I have a suggestion for the Alley. How about **Grianwald Alley?**
Grian, a video idea (not sure if it’s a good one) stream the grind to make the perhaps you perished parcel
I thought scar wanted to make a floating base
You should put the botim meeting room in the house at the back of the alley
WONK
3:21
Who else thinks there should be a channel called Hermitcraft bloopers?
And here I thought X solved the lag issues back in S6
Alley 35. Diagon in Pythagorean and Chaldean numericals is 3 and 5. At least that's my idea.
When I saw “Grian fell out of the world” on bdubs stream I knew this episode was going to be a good one
id rather him build at impulse
If you placed the oxidized copper among the new ones, it will oxidize faster... I think...
If you end up buying materials from other players to make your alley you can call it “Diamond Gone Alley” kinda like Diagon alley
Still called sub to Grian 20:00
Grian could could build a Barge carrige on The G-Train
Grian: nononononono Scar: 400 diamonds Grian: 👁👄👁
Ooooh so close to 7mil!!! You’ll be there in no time G!
Call the ally grally or gally
Name: Wonkycave Street
Well you have the G-Train so why not just call it the Galley
hear me out ok hear me out wonk alley
"Now these two looked a little bit too straight, so I added a little bit of WONK"  - Grian 2021
Name for base: Don't knockturn alley
There are lots of people giving names like puns off of vertical and horizonal and while this is the season of puns and I, myself, am a fan of Diagon Ellie perhaps giving the place a name like The Bish Shops (The Bishops) would be a little more subtle.
Griagon alley
Alleyway name: Horizont-alley If a nether counterpart is made: Vertic-alley
diagrain alley
I'd call it Caveway Alley.
The Ali cave is a good name
More like g train murdering
you should name your base the grianway
maybe netherite eff 5 pickaxe and haste 2 do the work?
Walley Wonky
Verdict Alley might be a good name for your base! Especially if you plan to have a sort of meeting/council building at the end for the goatem corporation to come to *verdicts*, and it follows the same naming convention as diagon alley. Diagonally, vertically, etc!
lol
i hate it when i lose everything lol
You can hear the worry in grians voice when scar fell in the hole and said he had no rockets, you two are so sincere and such good friends its unreal
I could see a building\bridge going from one side of the ally to the other
“Crevice Alley”
The best name: the g-allery
Why can’t we test an End-crystal while mining like you make a box with 2 crystals and shoot em with a bow and boom 🤔maybe
IM 7020TH!!!!
Grian so close to insta mine: it’s so slow  Me with iron pick: kachow
the bank, or Griangotts perhaps?
I typed Grian and it autocorrected to African tf
Hmmm maybe Color Alley?
Alistair the ally (Ali the ally)
It be funny if the breakdown in ep. 44 of season 7 was Grian showing the success of the G-train to past Grian.
6.9 mil sub's *pop nICE
13:38 season of the puns be like -well hole'done
Griagone Alley
You could name the alley grians great grotto
Grian's bank should be called the Griangotts (y'know, like Gringotts)
1 word: Lag
CURSE CAT: You didnt add the cuse of binding cat head to the shulker box for scar! he lost that aswell XD
You really ought to get 10 oopsies boxes ready to go just in case
Idea name boatogon ally
Make a grian-gots bank
i have a elytra
Mining for deepslate means mining for diamonds, therefore selling deepslate means even more diamonds... what's the problem again?
That was the stupidest thing I saw today lmao
Last season the barge: sold a lot of things. this season g train: sells a lot of things. next season g plane
Gulley is a term for alley in India, maybe name it Grian Gulley!
Tell me what your favorite ep was so far reply to tell me
Hello
I’m going to add wonk to my everyday life
I forget what was going in the back of the alley cave, but if it was a clock tower which i think it might have been? maybe a name for that could be "The Clockwork Cavern"... or was it a lighthouse? i dont remember what was going in the back of it :(
BOATEM ALLEY
ah yes the tapped man
Make and upside down G-Train in the nether and have it sell nether-only items!!!!
name the ally  grally grian + ally = grally simple math
Grian: blame it on lag Me explaining to my mum how the 500g of pure uncut cocaine in my room is because of lag
The hidden ally or Vally ally
I heard the word bank and immediately thought "GRIANGOTTS!"
I’m trying to start my own YouTube channel. Any advice?
Base name Diagon Ally
call the ally "griagon ally"
Copper weathers faster seperated i think
he should name the alleyway the gralleyway
Boatem ally
Brian since this is the season of puns and you make a farm in each building you could call it the FARMal Alley                                                                                                                                                                           (Formal) IDK 🤷‍♂️
So Scar finally has to do the back of the mansion!
May I make a suggestion, when you do the buildings in the Alleyway Grian, maybe you could show the inspiration of what the buildings are in real life?
6.9 million subs     pog
Spindly Street, just a name idea
me: *sees title* also me: NOT AGAIN
Deepstone alley?
Dia-grion alley
I love the twin buildings you built !
Gria-Gon ally, Griagon ally
You should call it dillydally Ali
instant karma🤣🤣🤣
More surprise clips please!!!!!
Idea for Alley name. GALLEY WAY. G ALLEY WAY. GALLEY WAY. LOL
What is happening to the scrren
"the big bank or something", will you bless us with Griangotts? :D
Hey grian, why dont you call your alliway ROWTEM
Imagine if this was 3rd life
Grian's Gallery Ally? Idk
you should call the alley 'G alley'
15:06 did scar just start breaking the bedrock?
Make the bank named Griangotts and The alley Griagon alley
*Hits the Like Button*  Dam Lag.
This is the most chaotic episode I’ve seen. Bribery, death, etc.
I wrote this in a previous post but I’m just saying you absolutely need to create either a personal treasure vault or a yoga base vault shaped like a bank (gringotts) and call it griangotts
BRUH PLEASE Build GREENGOTTS!!!
Call the alley: diagrian alley 😂
Ah, the price of shenanigans.
Hipoty hopity, scar place your property!
You should name the ally hermagon ally
You should call the alleyway the diagrianally
Griagon ally should be the name of the ally
End crystal ally
grian every episode: "you dont see how much of a grind this is"  also grian every episode: shows how much of a grind minecraft is.  i get it. grian you are great but come on this is pretty much the same as last episode. i dont want to be rude as i am a huge fan but bruh can we get a big storyline on the go or something. how im seeing it is all the other boatem crew and other hermits i watch are getting on with big interesting builds or storys like ren and doc. but you are mostly complaining about how long it takes to do things
you should name it the Galley get it the G-Allie :)
There is truly no server quite as fun to watch as Hermitcraft, huge and impressive bases, funny shenanigans and some of the best builders and redstone engineers I've ever seen
You should name the Alleyway Ali the alleyway
Make deepslate a limited edition product.
For season 9 you should make a semi truck with the different trailers selling different things
Is it me or is scar’s base starting to look like the “Ninky Nonk” from in the night garden??
"the unnamed alleyway" is a pretty good name man
alleyway name: Galley
If only there wasn't a big hole in the bedrock for you to lose your stuff like this. I wonder who came up with that idea to add it in the first place.  Oh wait...
You should do one building that is very tiny/short/small hidden by two big building on both sides
Grian: has efficiency 5 and breaks deep slate in a fraction of a second.  Also grian: ‘is so sloooowwwwwwwww’  Me: makes iron pickaxe Also me: SPEEDYBOOYYYYYYSSSS!,!,!!!,!,!,!
G-Alley way… hooray???? Idk thats a pretty cool name :)
a name idea is diagrian alley
In the alley you need to have a few buildings that people can go inside of. Maybe one of them could be a mueseum with "artifacts" from previous seasons. You should also extend tg train track so it makes it look like the train is coming out of a tunnel in the mountainside.
13 is an unlucky number
I have  a Dog my mum is mean to it ):
Copper ages faster when its seperated
When I saw the title I literally face palmed 🤣
Crystal ally
The only solution for scars base is for him to build a sky city above the whole of boatem.
How long will it be until the entire botem team get's sick of the hole and patches the whole thing?
You should make a rent-a-beacon for mumbo lol
Diagrian Alley
Can’t believe the amount of “lag” on the hermitcraft
Idk why but this episode was amazing I couldn’t stop laughing
How about "Vertic alley?" Diagon alley is meant to be "diagonally," so Vertic Alley would be "Vertically."
please name it horizont-ally or vertic-alley as a play on words of diagonally xD
Does Grian know that Big Eyes Pass n Gas has "upsie box" and it's almost "did you die" box?
I don’t know if it’s faster, but maybe neatherite pick could mine deepslate faster
please call the bank griangots! in diagrian alley
Name the alley Diagonal Alley OR Wonk Alley
The g agon alley
A barge and a train? I'm calling it now. Grian's shop in season nine will be a hot air balloon!!
Grian should build the Griangots bank
What about Alley innominatus, meaning unnamed alley
Shouldn’t the main building in the back be the boatem company building?
"Griangotts"?
wow
It's a griagonally
Grian you should make like a castle or a royal outpost or something like that
I think Scar was planning to make a city on a cloud instead of a mountain
maby bilf some houses and a path out side the g train so it adds  nice felling and makes it seem like there is a town outsied of the ally way
Hi
Mountgon ally
"the alley" is a good name for the alley. its just cool. I mean, we gave the mansion a name but we only ever called it the mansion.
"just gonna and some WONK!" LOL 🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
You should actually make that deepslate building in the unnamed alley Ollivanders, like the inspiration for it, but you could call it something really funny! (Sorry, I don't have any ideas, but it could be like a reference to the actual diagon alley, to show the whole idea of the base 😊)
I jumped when he hit you into the hole the first time.
16:48
lol
Cavegon ally
10:43 I THOUGHT THE SERVER WAS KID FRIENDLY
Minecraft needs some blocks that are slightly wider for creating crammed corridors
Maybe you could name it wonky town like funky town
grian grian grian stop dying like scar does
Name it the alley cave
I’m going to recommend Grain lane and Boatam alley.
“Tooooo scar” LOL like you just deciding who to send it to
Just call the alleyway what it is, an underground cul de sac
Alley-G (not Alley-A)
8:23 name it Ally the Alley Way
Isn’t there a place in the nether that has a lot of deepslate?
Yo 6.9mil subs btw
Grian should call the "bank" Griangotts, although that may be too on the nose.
this a bad idea but you could call the alley griagon alley (gree a gone alley)
Dia-grian-ally
you should put on a cat head and call yourself THE SHAMEFULL KITTY, kill people then give then the stupid boxes you do so well!!!!!!!
DO THE SEASON 6 MANSION. or half of it
Yal know Pearls' build here message for Scar, did anyone else see a very rude word instead of Swag? Let me give you a hint, Replace the W with a H.
ah The classic I was mining off camera and I got this amount of diamonds more like you went into creative mode and got them
POV: you were at bdubs stream  | \/
We should see Grian's actual face at this point :D 16:46
Call it diagon Grian
You should call the alley the fin-allay
Deepslatd takes so long to mine  Normal people without overpower tools: bruh
Diagrian Alley
Supply and Demand Grian.... SUPPLY AND DEMAND T.T (deep slate market in shambles from under pricing)
wonk alley
I think you should name the Alley "Intern Alley" like how Diagon Alley or Knockturn Alley is a pun on diagonally and nocturnally, this is a pun on internally since it is in a mountain
I like The Ally as a name.
Griagon Alley lol
Wonkey Critter alley.
Idea for alley name: Maui Street?
You should name “The Alley” Diagrian Alley
Watching this at 6.9 (noice) million subs
Call the ally way the grain way
5:45 grain says: "Only 6 shulkerboxes of deap slate" like that's nothing at all
Grian I have been watching since hermitcraft season 6 and I wondering  if maybe you could bring back sea of thieves with tortus I had a lot of fun watching those videos! Keep up the great work!
You should name your alley "Clockwise alley" or "Horizontal alley" lol
Maybe you should name the street "Shenanigan alley"
Hillside ally
Griagon Alley
Nice to see the building that is called “Bank or something” has been planned
Grian: "I'm sending a message!" Me: _War flashbacks to the Mycelium war and it's about sending a message_ :/
Allll I have to say is "Suffer the Consequences of Your Actions."
The wall of coppre dame has been rebuilt
YESEERRRR!!!!!
Ally name idea: diorite gone ally
You could name it the under cover alley way
When r u doing 3rd life again?
Hear me out.... for the name of Grian's alley.... WE NAME IT THE GRALLEY
me:*clicks off video* Also me:  :( Call the alleyway grainagon alley.
Warts ally you know like Hogwarts
is it just me or is grians content schedule now quality quantity
Netherite pick with efi 5 instamines deepslade
Funny how inconveniences give you great opportunity for mega profit, maybe you should do it more often 😏
name idea: wonkagon alley
Grian: "Apart from breaking my neck, what are we ACTUALLY doing this episode?"  The title: "Well yes, but actually no"  Edit: 450 likes is the most I've ever gotten. thanks, wow!
Maybe y’all shouldn’t have access to the void 😂
Love the upload streak
you should call your base Griagon Alley and if you build a bank at the end of it you can call it Griangots
Call the alley "Codfish Alley" or "Waffle Head Alley"
Maybe at the end of the ally way there could be a big Hello Neighbor like house that has design elements of all the ally houses before it incorporated.
I really hope they make deep slate instamine.
What about calling the alley, Griagon Alley
To go with naming stuff that's not really water related something watery, why not name it the Galley?
call the ally the deepslate detour
Polygon Ally
It’s always a good day when both Grian and Mumbo upload
i bet if u asked him u could convince scar to make multiple “did you perish parcels” for your shop in exchange for being able to take them for free when he needs them
Diagon Alley is a play on the word "diagonally" so maybe name it something to do with lines? Just a suggestion. :)
Economy ally
Call it diamond alley
*sigh*  I hate the boatem hole…so much…
Call it diagonal alley cuz puns
boatem alley
Name it "Hermigon Alley"
I live in York and seeing one of the buildings from the shambles is a bit of a shock
9:34 you should’ve said so I made them a lil fruity 😭😭
Alleyway name idea: Griagon Alley
Why did scar jump tho?
Grians gonna build gringots! I’m calling it early!!!
Love the time lapse music
I got an idea for the houses in the valley. You could capture some normal or some odd mobs in minecarts and have them in the windows. Nothing better than a ravager looking down on you when you walk your street inside a cave.
You you should name the alley diagonal alley because all the buildings are wonkey
Yes place your shag here lol
Grian has been through too much... even the title suggests so.
oH nO lAg!!!!!!
This video is just too funny for me
IF YOU DONT NAME IT DIAGON ALLEY YOU DONT DESERVE TO BE THIS GOOD AT MINECRAFT LOL
6.9M SUBS WHOOOOO
Scar wants to live on a cloud
The dark house in diagon alley reminds me of borgin and burkes
Tried to think of "alley" puns... of course Diagon Alley came from Diagonally... so maybe Horizon.T Alley.... or Gradu-Alley?
NAME IT GRIANGON ALLEY PLEASE
Grian.... alley..... gralley
The grally way
Scar wants to build a floating city, not a mountain
always vheicals grian do something original
Next episode you should take a random player and sacrifice them to the boatem hole
Name the alleyway the Jollyalley
Juangk
Scars definition of a “starter base” is quite different than most peoples
Every Scar episode in a nutshell is "Scar! What the heck did you get yourself into this time!"
griangotts bank
Grian you should go up to someone an buy their amor
Thoughts for the alley name: DiaGrian alley
How about naming the "Alley" "DiaGrain Alley"
Great another Brian video to eliminate my boredom
Im glad your okay after MCC, i genuinely was concerned.
The alleyway should be called alleywonka
Grigon ally
Grian should name the alley way “Die-again-alley”
Anom Alley _-_-_-_-_ Anomaly
Grian, hear me out here. I think that it would be *EXTREMELY PROFITABLE*  if you start selling sand and/or gravel because in the previous seasons those were some big sellers among the hermits and it would get you tons of diamonds
griagon alley
I lost it so many times while watching this episode!! lmao
Base name suggestion: Hermagon Alley. You know, keeping in line with all the puns.
Grian's Alley... The Galley?
Mumbo + Impulse = Carbon Neutral
He should call the alleyway “The Griagon Alley”
he added a little bit of wonk ;)
Grian you NEED to get gray parrots for your base as pigeons
Instead of gringots at the end, you should put griangots
Can you bring back Poultry man  ^-^
I am using my 2 brains to spell this
L A G
"Definitely"
Name suggestions:   Griagon Alley. Giagon Alley.  Lol.
you should build half of the season 6 mansion
GriannGrotts
cave ailly
The diagrain alley
I read "Scar, place your shack here" very differently....
lol this made me laugh, i needed that today
Hidden ally
I just thought what if in Minecraft there were slime block mine carts that push what ever is on it while it’s on the rail. Then the G train could actually move I mean I’m sure somewhere there’s a mod for it.
What about naming the Alley “Grianagally Alley”
the g-allyway
You should make the gringots bank at the end your trading hall. the goblins who run it  could be villagers.
Grian call the ally Griagon ally it's perfect
You gonna sell wands at olyvanders??
Day 3 of telling Grian to call the base Vertically (instead of Diagonally)
You should call the aley the wonk street
I got a name for the alley the bottom alley
16:46  *The only time grian made my brother wake up*
Wonk ally
hello
wasnt the alleyway supposed to have a name?
I would sell 1 stack deepslate for 3 diamonds
name the ally （The Vally Ally）
You could call it the "Cally". Cave and ally
The lally ally
“A little bit too straight” Me before theater camp
Grian, I know the copper dam looks nice but if you ever felt like it was oxidizing a Lil slow then you can space the copper 4 blocks away from eachother.
Scar and Grain dying was like Romeo and Juliet :'(
I think you should either call it Diagrian Alley (has your name) or Orthogon Alley (orthogonal instead of diagonal)
My life pretty much 9:29
Graingon ally
The Descent Alley. (Because it slopes down, its decent, and its an alley way)
you could call the alley horizont-ally
I feel the pain you've gone through in this episode, but it got me laughing so much. Loved all the interactions :)
Mystic ally
You should name the alleyway “Griagon Alley”
call it diamond alley, but said like die-a-mond, so it sounds like diagon alley
If you ever did a meetup on the east coast sometime, that'd be amazing 🥺💖🤌
Grian, you know its a cloud, right?
HAHAHAHAHAHA! This episode is hilarious!
Scar: Giant starter base Me: smol dirt hut
The underground alley
season 9: THE G-PLANE!!!!!
You should call it the galley, (grian alley)
Tnt mining time
Oof
I hope your internet gets better
6.9 MIL lesgoooooooooooooooo hes done it
Yooo, 6.9m subs
At least you got revenge for when Scar purposefully hit you into the boatem hole and you lost everything :P
Turn the ally into a flight course and call it flyagon ally
The Diagrian alley
You need to name your base the G-Alley. It's a type of boat, and also fits the theme of the G-Train.
Maybe a big clock tower in the middle?
For the alleyway i think Grian should call it Horizont-alley or Vertic-alley
name your cave "Tilting Caverns"
Name Idea the allywonk
From what I remember scar wanted to build a sky island, so he may actually build there!
11:46 and totally totally unrelated is the fact that mumbo can’t kill the other for the wither star
So nobody noticed scar breaking bedrock at 15:03
Add a wonky half mansion (season 6 mansion)
You could call it Diamond Way❗️Much love from Italy ❤️
Official petition to name the Alley "The Galley"
If you space out the copper it oxidized faster
Grian should call the alleyway “The G-Alley”  Or not, it’s kind of dumb
6.9Million subscribers ha ha Ha funny number
You should do tegg again when most people have mega bases
Grian, if you don't want to mine deepslate yourself, make the CEO of Boatem Inc do it.
adding minecarts that connects both sides would look reeeaaallllyyyy cool
Griangotts bank best idea
Who’s gonna tell him the reason the copper takes so long to oxidize is bc it’s not spread out
Grian can you please 🙏 name the ally way ally-gonally
When will grian learn to not have everything on him when messing with the void
Pls name the alleyway the Galley!!!!!!!!!
Your such a personality vacuum grian. (For all you idiots out there that means annoying.) I hate you.
Could you invite cubfan into the gigabase.
The Undergrown valley!!
DIAMON-D- ALLEY OMLEHFRHEHECEGEHEU
What about Scar's hat
"Cavic Calley" Instwad of galley
If HermitCraft...
I have a feeling that boatem is going to have an elytra shrotage real soon.
My favorite name thit i thought of was griagon ally
Grian-gots, name for the bank, not original commenter just want Grian to notice
he needs  to name the bank Griangotts
Perhaps The alley could be called “Wonky Walkway”, I think it sounds nice
If it's the diagonally, where's the diagonal part of it?🤣
That hole is the best thing about this season
I think that the alley should be called "Vertic Alley" due to the height of all the buildings
Grian dieing in the void was instant karma
dripstone ally as a name
Everyone with grian near the hole 💀🖐
grian: build a tnt duplicator
Grian died to lag. And you can't tell me otherwise
Season 7 Grian makes a boat for a shop.   Season 8 Grian makes a train for a shop  Season 9 Plane?!??
it was hilarious but you deserved that one grian xD
Grain should make the building at the end the barge or inspired by the style ( it won’t be shop) and next. To it a chicken farm as a tribute to season 6
Alley G... I mean, any other name is just wrong.
U should call the alley gre Gon alley
God. I laughed my butt off. Amazing video <3
Earliest I’ve caught a video! Wow
I have never laughed harder than I did when all that copper "lagged" into Grian's inventory XDDD
Why is the video is so lag
Netherite pickaxe might have instamine on deepslate. Not sure but it is faster than diamond.
How about "Diamond Alley" ?
The bank robber at the trial be like:  "The money just lagged into the bag"
wonky alley
Scar punching people into the boatem hole is the funniest thing. He's officially the most chaotic Hermit. Also, isn't the Alley just called the "Galley?" for G-alley?
diamonds gone alley
You should call your diagon alley "carve alley" or something like that. Because you carved it in to the mountain. I hope you see this.
The g train should go down the street in ur main build
i think you need netherite tools to mine faster the deepslape sorry for bad english
Grian is evolving into scar
One might say that the deal with Scar is v o i d now LoL.
you gotta stop losing everything
like a previous comment said, you should call the alleyway "intern-alley" , like the word internally
18:05 THIS IS MY FAVOURITE PART OMG HAHAH
The g-way
Yaaay
8:47 Once a Potterhead always a Potterhead
Bruh
Season 9, The Gargo Plane
Grian, Yes extactly as you had it, (No more channeling or impaling)
The Underalley
Name suggestion: Waffle Ally Street
You should add a tall house and a tiny one next to it. I’d be pretty funny
Make a train station and put most of the items there, and then you should put the exclusive or expensive items in the train. 😁
6.9 million subs nice
For the alley ---- THE GALLEY. G - GRIAN
Someone outta tell pearl to fix her scar sign, I didn't get a good look but I don't think she said shack
Dia-mond Alley?
I think the name Diagrian Alley is kinda cool for the base
Because the alley slowly goes downwards. You should call it “Vertic-alley”
is the second inspiration photo from york?
name suggestion Vertic Alley
btw copper oxidizes faster when separated
Nice, 6.9 million subs
Idea For Naming. @Grian   Di Ali-Baba Cave (As In The Alley Of Ali Baba Cave Since It's A Season Of Puns )   P.S. Maybe You Can Have A Treasure Cove Inside
This might not be the most creative name request but, what about Grianally Grian-Ally
Grian: I only got 6 shulker boxes of deepslate. EVO Grian: I CAN BARELY GET A CHEST OF CLAY!!!
You're such a wonker
I think that the alley should be called Hexagon so it would be..... HexagonAlley
Name for the ally G-farms ally
the bank should be called Grian-gotts
The big building at the back should DEFINITELY be Gringgotts but you should call it "Grian-Gotts"!!
Griagon Alley
Someone should wax the copper dam as a prank it would be funny when grian finds out
You should name it grians wonky village
Call the alley diagrian alley
Seeing as you've added plenty of Wonk call it Wonky Alley
Can the train stop at platform 8 1/2
U should have named the trident "tri dent in my wallet" 😅
Call it the grally
Scar's hello at the end made my day
you should do a bonus clip every episode
On the topic of deep slate, villagers really should trade for it, as it looks SO good.
Omggg not again 😭
he wants scar to terraform the mountain basically so grian doesnt have to terraform it i see.
Wonk -Grian
I got a name for the Alleyway but it isn't great Mountingways not the best idea
Here’s a name for the alleyway: Griagon ally. It’s like Daigon ally but we’ll… Grian
I was thinking…how about DyGrian Alley
Maybe scar could build an entire island above the boatem pole and boatem hole
Y'know. It would be nice if in a future update we could farm deepslate, do something like Basalt, maybe have it so if there's crying obsidian below a water source and lava flows on top that the water block becomes deepslate, or something? I know there'll be plenty of the stuff spawning naturally in the next update so we'll be able to just go and mine it, but I'd also love to be able to farm it so I could AFK collect it and don't have to light up a huge underground area when I need 8 double chests full of the stuff.  Also I wish we could smelt dripstone blocks to make calcite. It would make some sense anyway since IRL both calcite and most stalagmite and stalactite formations are all formed from calcium carbonate.
I find it so funny he just uses the other hermits usual lines in this episode ( ex: Two brain cells : Mumbo )
A good name for the alley would be just The Galley
name the alley the galley you know g-train =. grain so g-alley = galley
Name for grains base grain valley
Scian ally grian and scar
call it griagon alley or griangon alley
Griangon Alley???
Horizont alley
Grian I'm telling ya please make it into diagon ally and make the end of the ally gringots
Grian, what about The Crooked Cranny for the name of your alley base?
wonky alley? wonkalley? whaddya think?
Wow so much lag
GRIAN!!! PLUG UP THE BOATEM HOLE, NOW
Horizont alley
Are you making platform 9 and 3/4
Grain:The price for depslate is going to be high 2 diamonds for 2 stacks I feel bad for people I’ll do 3 diamonds for 2 stacks Me: :/
Grian needs to build a bank and call it GRIANgotts
Hello
Why don’t you call it ‘The Grally’
hey do a subscription based thing where you make a perhaps you perished box and give them to hermits in advance. so that you don't have to instantly give them stuff and have time to prepare for a new one and they can pay whenever they want( or how you like). But great building addition to the alley, loved it.
Name for the alleyway… ‘The G District’
griaggon alley
Name your ally   Straight ally
Idea the grally
Beacon has disconnected
that's why I like keep inventory
ol Bdubbs has actually made a deepslate farm I believe.   It works in a Bdubbs sort of way.
you know scar is sad when he clearly sees he can hit grain in hole but cba
Maybe name it the Galley
Grain alley  In spelt grian wrong on purpose
Perhaps Wonkturn Alley for the alleys name based on "wonk" and Knockturn Alley
Call the alley ''griangotts''
Maybe for a name for the alley: Diagrian Alley
Grian you can use a gold picaxe its faster but it also breaks faster
Grian at each Boatem Co location you should have an ender chest so people don't have to carry all their diamonds (like and atm)
You should name the alley ‘The Abyss’ because *y e s*
i think you should name the ally ‘Vertic Ally’ since you used reference pictures from universal studios
you should name it the gralleyway
So at the end of the alley he's gonna build Griangotts?
GRIANgotts bank!
Put cobwebs at the bottom, give people time to think about what just happened
Grians new meeting room "captive audience " poor scar
Me: *reads title of this video* Me: *sigh* come ooon grian
Alley name idea: Squig Alley.
If you dont build the Weasleys wizard wheezes in your ally I will be very disappointed
Make sure your still subscribed to Grian! I have been for a long time and is just said I wasnt :') Problem fixed
The UnNamed alleyway does sound like a nice name for it.
Do a hermit nostalgia where you do what did before hermitcraft for every hermit, you can do EVO.
I went on holiday to York so made sure to visit shambles after your video
Name the alleyway the g-way
That hole is both the worst and best addition to this server.
Idk what to call the alley but if you build a bank call it Griangots. Love your content!
You could call the alley "Diagrian alley"
twice in 2 weeks damn
Copper ages slower when together Someone please tell grian
the poultryman for copper dame
grian: were gonna be sending scar a message  me ITS ABOT THE PRINCIBLE
Grian what happened to the small alleys between the buildings
I’m just waiting for a video montage of all the victims of the botemhole
I got a good name for the alleyway the galleyway
Looking at the comments before finishing the video is like reading random parts of a movie script then watching the movie and just waiting  for those parts to come up
You should build a coral reef by the boatem pole and call it the boatem shoal
Grian, on the right side, u can add like a villager trading center, for everyone to use. But the entrance costs 2-3+ diamonds. That's just my idea
Scar is building a floating city… good luck with the roof of the cave
the auto correct changed it to grain instead of Grian
I’m sorry Grian but I don't realy like the timelaps music can we get the old one back
Oi scar mate place your “shag” here 💀💀
I feel guilty likening the video cos of the title
@Grian Name your bank Graingots
Where’s the classic time lapse music in hermit craft 7??
Name the the valley the g-valley
Karma
Place some black concrete at the bottom of the boatem hole! First of all, it’s easily removable for meetings, you can’t fall and lose everything, and it’s good for pranks for people on the server who like to play chicken with the void, they’ll just splat and not lose everything
How do you mass gather and transfer items ?
I hope scar still builds near grian
Grian the splef master
Gally way??
dragon alley as a play on dagon alley?
SB: Diamonds are for peasants
A nice name for the alleyway could be Basilisk Lane that way at the end of the alleyway you could have a Basilisk horde where you store riches as decoration
just a little scar stuck in a hole
What about vertic ally?
grain could you curse
Just like in the last season lol
Name it Boatem alley
You should build a personal nether hub based off of knockturn alley.
Hey Grian my ideas for the base name would be something like the base boulevard or hermit hollow
Why not call it Griagon alley
Why not name the alley “Galley” since you will be walking around often with the farms and how it just looks so appealing.
I'm pretty sure if u have a netherite efficientcy 5 pick and beacon it's insta mine not 2 sure tho
and the train like it’s shipping stuff to the bank
Bulid hogwarts at the end
That was too much of the word wonk
This is why Grian only uploads once a week, because he spends so much time on making the content top quality.
The bank should be a storage/netherite throne like it was in the last season
It’s night time. Why did you record this now
Make all the farms lead to the bank and make the bank a shop and storage
The A-copper-lypse is inevitable if Grian’s Dam oxidizes completely
I’m sensing a trend and I have figured out boatmen was a mistake for the economy of hermitcraft So many wasted diamonds
Griangon ally
“We don’t allow window shopping here ( *Kills creeper* )”  -Grian 2021
Karma. Karm, karma, karma. That's what you get for BEING A CHEEKY IMP to actual cinnamon roll Scar.
i think it should be called "horizont alley" or "vertic alley" 😁😁😁😁
You could name the alley the "galleyway"
F
I'm waiting for a video called Poultry man returns
I love watching you build grian!!!
alleyway name recommendation:  slate street?
Totally lag
Hey G Where ever the train goes here and there put some tiny barge with limited sales and discount and hard to get blocks like deep slate
I didn’t find that boring. In fact, at only a 3 second time-lapse, it was over too early.
Name it Diagonally Alley
Scar has said repeatedly that wants to build a cloud city, not a mountain
You have 2 brain cells I have none
You should name the alley ''The Demagorgon Alley'' or ''The Time Alley'' as it will take you soooo long to build or you can name it ''The 26th street'' as in 26 hermits of the hermicraft or the ''Botum moutum gotom alley'' as in botum (of course) moutum = motivation, gotom= go to :) or i mean you could name it ''The END Alley'' and then put the egg somewhere visible like on the banks entrance or something like that . or you can name it the ''Bronzewood Alley'' representing your bronze wall (just giving ya some cool and fun ideas xD)
About deepslate, it is really easy to get it with a tunnel bore; the tnt blows it up with a 100% drop rate and can be smelted back into deepslate (not cobbled variant)
when he said "send scar a message" I was thinking like OH NOH ANOTHER WAR
Allyway = Gallyway
Alley name suggestion- Alleyway-to-go
Well at least you died helping a friend
Build the G train around the base
We need a new mayor
I didn’t expect grian to voluntarily jump into the boatem hole
"Diamonds are for peasants" -SB737 after watching this
I am here enjoying a cuppa tea as you fall to your death
When you said fortie a thought you said fortnight
I still say the giga base needs a weasley wizard wheezes
With how many times you’ve died the last couple of episodes u should call the alley “Die-a-lot Alley”.
You could name it “boatem cove”
Grian be like I have only 6 shulkers of deepslate
Why is Scar so easy to scare?
2:04 need I say more
Name it diagrian alley
Grain has 6.9 subs HES MADE IT
You could name the alley Cavernue! Because it's a cavern and an avenue!
*it’s scar’s fault*
Lag ally
At the back of the alley way aka you mega base you should make a hall of fame or something like that and maybe put like rare mobs in glass cages and name them something.
Digrian alley
The alley should be called ‘Horizont alley’ (Horizontally) as a play on ‘Diagon alley’ :D
Best episode of hermitcraft I've seen so far. That was hilarious!!
The Boatem Hole has been simultaneously the worst idea and best idea I've ever seen on Hermitcraft.
Mumbo’s base is called “The Couch Potato”
Oh fine-ally
Word of the year: *wonk*
spreading the coper blocks out will help the speed of the oxidisation
Set the prize for deepslate at 2 diamonds per Stack and dont make the 3 daimonds deal. If you prize your deepslate up you don't need to restock so often.
Boatem alleyway
Place your shag here lol
You should use the oxidized copper from the "Copper Dam" for the building at the end of the ally
Because he’s building guyagon alley, he should name it griangon alley
Grians outros remind me of the Minecraft let’s play days
How about calling it The Diagrian Alley.
Scar sees message  Buids sky base above the mountain
grain you should call the ally way gway
Grian, the Alley seems a bit similar o another Alley I can recall. Maybe call it the Intern Alley because it is in a cave, or perhaps, ASTHETIC ALLEY because it's so pleasing to the eye?  *insert winks and nudges here*
Who else thinks that "Dia-Grian Alley" should be the name of Grian's mega base?
U should call it vertic-alley
The Graly
You can make the ally "diagrianally"
The Grian Alley  (A.K.A: The Gralley)
gria-gon alley
Downton Grally
You can make a generator for deep slate lol
Make a huge portal at the end
Grian at the start: I don’t want to make a mega base this season  Grian now: We are building the largest base in hermitcraft history
Fun name idea for the alley:   The Gralley
Moral of the story: Mojang made bedrock unbreakable for a reason.
Name idea for the alley: the grally
Ty for the bonus clip
If you build a bank call it griangotts
"Apart from breaking my neck, what are we actually doing today?"  I found that *way* funnier than I should've.... what is wrong with me??
where is scar getting these diamonds? hes been trading non-diamonds basically this whole time i mean 400 is A LOT to just mine on your own
I know this sounds wierd but I think (The Grease Way) is a good name for a allie, it even has a G in it
How about galley 😏
Grian, you’re missing a great opportunity to put “Grian-gotts” at the end of the alleyway…
Once again "it's just a prank bro!" Gone wrong 😆😅😆😅
I do believe the lag wars have begun
ally idea: The big grally
“Place your shag here” HAHAHAHAHA
The bank should be called grian-gots
Magic-alley

A name suggestion for the alley: What abou Boatem boulevard?
May I suggest vertic alley because diagon alley makes diagonally so vertic alley is vertically
Woah! I did not expect you to make 3 episodes in only a couple days!! I appreciate the grind on videos so much!!!
I just realised you could annoy all the hermits by rearranging all their stuff i. Their chests
poor little meow meow is stuck....
I really hope they make deepslate instant mine with netherite in the next update. Or even in a patch or something so that we don't have to wait a year for quality of life updates
Where is the extra clip of you guys as trees?
You could call the alley like diagon alley like diagonally it’s a bit of a pun I made up
I knew it, he will build a skybase so no roof for you! Lol
Call it diagonal alley as opposed to diagon ally
The Wonk-A-Away
Mountain ally
Oh no .2 seconds to mine a block
“What are we actually- apart from breaking my neck ( *goes on like nothing happened* ) what are we actually doing today?”

Call the cave Diagrain alley   Yes grain is how it should be spelled
Just name it diagonally
You have the “G Train”, how about for the ally way you call it the “G Lane”?
grian almost 7 mil :sunglasses:
you should name it the Galley as in G-alley but its pronounced gal-ee
Scar the glue man
You should do offers and limited time stuff at the g train so you don't do as much grinding but people do more buying
I just had an idea for the street name: Which street, or witch one, or something like that, because you know, puns.
name it the gally way
Street name: "Sloping Street"
You should call the alley the "Wonky- Way or Wonky-Ally" because everything has a nice wonk
The amount of items lost to the Boatem Hole is hilarious.
If there was a salesman in hermit craft,it’d be grian
Hey grian just got out of school to see your video you make my day a bit better every time I see one of your videos pop up hope you're having a better day than me

GRIAN!! Idea: Build a bank and name it GRIANgots for Gringots
ally-sway? because they are tilted.
"I'm going to stock deepslate"  *oh no please grian save yourself*
Pot calls the kettle black
Buy a trident from etho, he has a decent few
Hey grian I was wondering if you would or could make knockturn alley as an extension to diagon alley and possibly make gringotts bank or make it a shop of some sort, just a suggestiom
The downwards alley
Please call it "Gria-gon Alley"
Poggers
In the movies it is called diagon ally so two ideas he might like are   1. Horizont ally 2. Vertic ally  I know these are terrible but I don’t care
Grain gots please make that the name of a building
POV: Scar didn’t built here
yeah i really hope 5car builds there
"Doesnt it have curse of binding on it"  "N- no?... Dang it"  I found that hilarious for some reason
o título desse vídeo tá tipo: PERDEU TUDO! O drama de Grian (vivendo de casa de terra)
You could call it the gallie way to combine allie and grian.
Grian you could of just hit your axe on the copper and it would go back to ikr original colour
man lag sucks
Name for the alley "DiaGrian Alley"
The Wonky-way! random names for the alley <3
T
As ilmango has explored you can get on average 129 diamonds an hour instant mining. If you apply that logic to hermit craft prices I find it very difficult to understand why so many things you sell are for so few diamonds. No price should every be below 129 diamonds per hour worked because otherwise you are loosing potential dimonds from time investment. There is absolutely something to be said for being able to do a variety of task in Minecraft but as iskals 2000 diamond chalange showed you could become the richest hermit every by diamond mining faster then by selling thing that are not easy to collect.
Name for the allyway, the Blockway.
Orthogonal Alley
the alleyway has a ring to it
You should try to make a Rent a Beacon service get 4-5 emerald beacons and rent them out for a few days at a time
I have a name for your alley, you could call it galley, or G - alley
Grian really            Good job            For a noble cause

Oh. My god.
Isnt Scar building a city in the clouds?! A "Bioshock: Infinite" inspired build?!
Has anyone noticed that grians hermitcraft shops are all based on Transportation? Season 6 was a wagon. Season 7 was a barge. And now season 8 is a train!
at the end of the alley you should build a giant fireplace
Thrid Life 2 supposed to start in August right?
Grian: Deepslate is as slow to get as logs. Me, on Bedrock edition: Logs are insta-mine with a beacon and Efficiency V

The alley is modelled off of diagon-alley. But Minecraft is all blocks and no diagonals Therefore it should be called horizont-alley

My favourite building in the alley is still the first building made of warped wood.

CALL IT THE DRIAGON VALLEY BECAUSE YOU BEAT THE WNDER DRAGON
Deepslate with Eff 5 and beacon is as fast as mining stone with just an unenchanted pickaxe, I think there's something wrong here!
Deepslate could be a currency.

Gri-agon-alley
How about horizont-alley for the name of the alley

Your only other option for getting the trident back is Etho… not sure if that’s better or worse lol
Ooh! Call it Griagon Alley!
What i love from hermitcraft is how easy it is to turn a good moment (16:30) into a panic moment (16:35)
The alley could be called “The Galley” Grians Alley!!
How about "Galley"
Grian gas 6,9 milion subscribers, that are 1 milion nice's
You should build a Gringotts bank at the end of the alley
"place your shag here" *Oh no*
You should build Grian-gotts at the end of the alley, it would fit in and i think it is a perfect name!!!
"Scar build here!" "NO! Scar build here!!!"     *season 6 buildoff flashbacks*
just plug the boatem hole with black wool or concreate :D will be fun to watch the "died from faling from high places" messages
You should make one of the buildings in the barge style
It should be called the Gralleyway
10:43 "Place your shag here" 😳😳 Naughty
Call the ally the grain-al ally
This hole has created more problems than its worth, great entertainment though!
Call the ally diagrian ally
Have an idea for the bank. If you have a gold farm or tons of gold make the top of the bank a beacon made with gold
6.9 mill subs. Nice
name the Alley way Greagon Alley.
What if the deepslate train gets swapped out sometimes with limited items that are hard to get
Could call it Diagrian Alley.  Or perhaps Diagrain  Alley.
instead of calling it the alley how about calling it "The Griangonalley"
Wooo
why don't you name the ally, farmagon ally
How do I get your time lap music. (To listen to)
Alleyways normally are connected to the back doors not the front doors
Next season make a Barge Train
YOU DID AMAZING MCC16 GRIAN! you better win next time you do it.. >:)
Damn! A cobber dam cover.
name the alley way "the Galley way"
at the end of the season, you should sacrifice the dragon egg to the boatem hole

The boattem hole is probably the worst decision Grian ever made
6.9 million subs, nice
If you separate the copper it oxidizes faster.
Those are the rarest types of diamonda
Alleytown Area
Ah yes… the Griagon alley
Grinally?
"holed on scar"  the puns never end
I'm in Yr 11 and recently moved into a new school and I haven't made any friends (and I'm guessing I won't). I'm depressed every day cause no one cares to talk to me during lunch times or at all so every time I see that you posted a new video I get so happy cause I know my day will get just a bit better, so thanks Grian for posting videos and helping me get through my depression
6.9 mill pog
Heres an idea on what to call your alley, hermit street[ I know it's an alley but I think it might work idk]
Griam makes building look way easier than it actually is
Jokes on Grian! Scar's building in the sky!   XD
If you did a bank for the centre of your base you could call it Griangotts
Original: Diagon alley  New: ender dragon alley
Grian: makes a stasis chamber  also grian: *dies again*
Boatem alley?
Diagrian alley?
name for base: the wonkway
Alley way name idea: Grainy Way
I love the idea of naming it “The Vertic-Alley” (Vertically instead of diagonally 😂)
Grian straight up forgot netherite exists  Lmfaooo
The bank should be the storage system
Grian, you could call the alley way: The Grialley way, pronounced Gralley.
If you made a bank you could call it Griangotts
🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦Stupid botem hole
bruh i lost a bunch of good stuff the other day too 😎
I thought "The Galley" was a good name (G-alley)
TommyInnit: Im not sure if Im allowed to scream in here... BUTIMGONNADOITANYWAY Grian: I dont wanna collect deepslate... BUTIMGONNADOITANYWAY
what are the possible ramifications for having burning chimneys in the cave. collapse? mass lung cancer? all im saying is we dont know what the ceiling of the cave looks like yet and i feel like a mix of stalactites and pipe-like chimneys weaving and burrowing into the rock sound kinda coool
Griagon alley
6:36 * Me laughing in Bedrock😅
Grian tunnel bore. Its by far the best way to get deep slate. A single explosion doesn't collect much but you can still bore through an entire vein super easy.
You should name the alley boatem alley. For obv reasons :D
You could call the alley cove's corner.
I love the time lapse music it reminds me of Skylanders
Uhm diagon alley
Dear Grian, In the words of Hornet from Hollow Knight "Git gud!"
A boatem-seal is starting to sound better and better
Diagon alley
6;9 mil subs pog
“If you aren’t gonna buy anything, this is what happens” *Brutally murders the creeper with a knife*
6.9 subscribers nice 👌
The dynamic of Grian and Scar is literally just Goblins, that's all I have to say They are just cats that play Minecraft for youTube
You should name the ally wanky
100 episodes later, I’m finally done with the back
Your alleyway should be named a grudge
Grian should call the alley, galley
You should put curse of vanishing on the stuff in the perhabs your perished parcel to increase sale
Grians never built the back of a main base in hermitcraft season 6 was a circular tower build season 7 was the mansion and ya’ll know what happend there and now he’s getting scar to do it
Name your base as street oo4
"copper that i've been accumulating"? you meant copper that lagged into my inventory
Yes its lag Grian
If you continued the tracks for your G-Train into that mountain of yours, the alley could have a grain station.
Diagon Alley - Diagonally so..... Vertic Alley - Vertically  Horizont Alley - Horizontally
Grian”Scar build a mountain Scar” I’m gonna build a huge caravan
How about Griagon Alley?
grain call the alley da hood
Boatem Gulley/Grally…
Grian Should call the alleyway Grian’s way
I just hope Weasley's Wizard Whizzes makes its debut in Hermitcraft.
man crazy lag this episode.
By “Think of a decent name for it “ Grian really means decent pun for it.
Here's an idea: at the end of the alleyway build a bank that's gonna be your storage room and name it "Griangotts"
Diagonal alley
You should call the alley the "maui way" like your cat
wonk counter: 7 first wonk: 9:34 second wonk: 9:40 third wonk:  9:43 fourth wonk: 9:47 fifth wonk: 9:49 sixth wonk: 9:50 seventh wonk: 9:56
I'm starting to think the boatem hole was a bad idea
Let’s see how scar can screw this up   Famous last words
We haven't had a war yet something seems wrong
twirling valley
Name suggestion below
You should build a hollywood-esk sign saying BOATEM on the side of pearl's mountain
grian shouting 'place your shag here' made my day
What about Alley Too, Electric Avenue?
Name the alley the “wacky alley”
Man I love booties       Its too funny
The alley should be called dieaGRAIN alley lol 😂
idea for the alleyway: put a futuristic house in the alleyway, as a callback to your season 6 base now you might argue that it wouldnt fit in, but i dont think there will be much of a problem  OR you could make a house similiar to your house in the s6 build height battle, with a dragon/baby dragon at the top  oh and also maybe replace the path with a river, like i suggested last episode
Caveway alley?
E
For the end of the alleyway you can make a bank named Griangotts... You know since it is diagon alley inspired..
What if you called the alley ‘Diagrain alley or something like that’
He should name it diagonal alley because every build is wonky
Scar is so confusing sometimes. Like really what are the chances of you running out of rockets and falling into bedrock. 😂
It would have been fun to call it the alibi
Scar dying is the best thing I've seen in a while! Good job Grian!
The botem hole double death was probably the most head pounding thing to watch
Alley cia or alicia is what the alley should be called. Because it is the season of puns
If you space the copper apart 3-4 blocks apart then it oxidizes faster
The grally way name for the ally way
Nobody:  Me: vibing to grian’s time laps music.
Imagine if he builds it in the sky lol
Grian: i only got 6 shulker boxes full of diamonds   Me: doesnt want to mine 4 stacks with full netheritr pick and becaon with haste 2 😅🤣😂
6.9m subs Nice
You should put gringots bank at the end of the path
you could call the alley way, Quarryville because its in a mountain and its like a village
Why not call the alley “alley of wonks”
8:18 Name it  GRI-AGON ALLEY!!!!
what about nameless aleyway?
When you notice that grian is on 6.9 million subscribers. Nice we did it lads 😂
PERFECT NAME FOR THE ALLEY: Grianganally
The simplest solution is often the best one: just call it boatem alley.
Maybe call the alley, finn-alley
Sooooo Much Lagggggg, your viiddeos mmakeee mee lllaugh
Desperate Scar is just too funny. 😂😂😂 Scar whispers: yea yea yea throw it throw it throw it
What about B.Alley? Like Boatem Alley or smth
again? again
also, at the end of the alley where the bank or central office is going to be, on the inside you should have the walls open to the ocean like in evo, but you'll have to use glass
The alleyway should be called Cavernue!!
10:40 place your what where? Someone gonna go back to school to learn how to spell. 😳
I died to today, with full netherite and two triedents. So ye I get the pain
Name for the alley: Griangon alley
I know what to call the alley “diagon alley”
Imagine if scar builds hogwarts on top of diagon ally
Call it the Cally the cave ally
How about Diagrain Alley?
Diagon Alley such a magical place ;)
Hey Grian do you watch the marvel movies because if you do I think it would be cool if you put the sanctum sanctorum from dr strange in your Megabase as like a Easter egg
Only downside to the Boatem Hole is the permanent loss of items every episode
Blackstone Ali should be the name
Grundlewood Alley?
“If your friend jumped off a cliff would you???”  Grian: 16:38
"I may need to up my game to convince Scar to built here"  After a few minutes:     You recive: 1 ender pearl  I recive: The entireback of my base constructed
Grian should call the ally, “The Boatem Alley”
Liygron ally or grain way
Again?
The galley?
Ally name idea  "ally avenue"
Why won't my phone let me watch this, it keeps going mad.. Only this video, not a single other one
I was going to say 5 diamonds per half stack. You will not have a competitor for a while. No-one wants to mine it. Not to mention you don't like getting it.
Gringots has definitely got to be replaced by Griangotts right???
Boatem Alley is easy and memorable.
Since it took almost grian 2 hours to pretty much get 2 stacks of diamonds that would be a hour to get 1 stack.
cakl your base the vegas strip
grian: only 6 shulkers of deepslate  me: only 32
Grian’s lucky he has 2 brain cells  me and my BESTAY combined have 1
Oh that last parts was hilariously funny. I love u guys😂
Alleyway name suggestion:  As it is based on Diagon Alley and build by Grian…why not DiGrian Alley?  It doesn’t look nice, but it sounds almost similar!
Spacing out the copper makes it oxidize faster
Haha jokes on you, Scar is building a base in the sky
21:27 Knowing Grian, he will probably actually unleash an apocalypse.
some  names for the ally could be cave ally, grain ally, boatem ally and Abby ally
G-agon-alley
You could call it Cubic alley as opposed to Diagon Alley, and perhaps a ginnell to Mumbo's base? Also, the building at the end is Gringotts Bank.
Grian + Alley = Gnarly (or gnarlley)
Call the bank at the end Grian-gotts!
The big building in the back should be the hq for boatem corp
I haven't laughed that hard in a while. Oh god, the coughing fit. XDD
Griagon alley
Grian make it diagon alley
The more you say wonk the wierder it sounds
okay so what are we doi-        ok, a part from breaking my neck... hahahahha
There is a clear difference here. You built the back of your base; you just didn’t decorate or terraform it. Mumbo just didn’t build the back. You’re allowed to mock it.
“Wonk” is now my favorite word
Diamond gone Alleyway
a name idea for your base, The Crooked Crack
Karma watches Grian's videos and laughs
Wonk🤣
Should call it vertical alley, like diagon alley but the opposite
Grain + Alleyway + Boats    Gallyway?
Mumbo: *Our* beacon Grian: *Our* copper Scar: *Our* deaths
you know, neither of them would be in that mess if scar still carried wizard fruits...
A wither is quite a good way to "farm" deepslate, I fought the wither and decided to do it in an area of deepslate and got like 3-4 stacks in a few mins
Soon "The Wonkey Donkey"
You're just not responsible enough for the boatem hole lol
you can call the ally-way a gally-way
Hey Grian!! Are you looking to eventually make a Gringotts-esque roller coaster? It could be a return of the Barge's coaster from last season!
grian can we see you chestmonster
wongc
Call it Griagon Alley
Grian, perhaps make a steam-engine at the entrance to the tunnel under Pearls mountain, it will look like it’s preparing to take off
Grain: "and i do have a extra secert bonux clip" *The clip* Scar: The-AHHDHhahah..hha..i thought u l-lefttt"
Look at the number of subscribers ☺
who decided it was a good idea to make a void hole in the literal center of town??? the Botem hole has claimed so many items at this point it's hilarious
The curse of binding. XD You shouldn't have killed him.
Yo greeeann, Funniest one yet. Do not let scar off ur hook.. and get one of de gurls to help set a trap 4 him...
instead of overthinking, he can over build
you should name the helmet       help me
He should also add an “griangotts bank” building in the alleyway. Edit: Grian did it! Haha.
"the allyway? more like the "ali b". only dutch ppl will understand.
You could name the ally DiaGrian-ally
the wnkway
the allyway just seems like eastern london
You should call the alley the Bo-dalley Bodalley after boatum and the alley
X rx tdc4 xtcf5v4f
Grian should call the alley “Erebor Alley” named after the lonely mountain in middle earth!
You should name the alley, “Diagrian alley”
love th content grian  i hope no one on the server starts the demise game from season 6 or 7 back becaus boatem is gonna be a hot spot on deaths and i like the coper dam too, its a new minecraft clock
You should name the alley, The Galley!
The alley should be called undergon alley! Like if you agree
Name the alleyway Griagon alley
I think if you can blank out while mining, mining deep slate, you will be fine, I was able to blank out for 8 hours and continuously mine that stuff.
Instant karma!
Name idea for the alley: diagrian alley
A good name could be the cave within the cliff
This will probaly get lost in the comments but I think u should name the alley way galley way for giga base and of course grian gcar gumbo gimpulse and gerlescent goon
I love Grians base! Its like a "hall of wonders!"
@Grian CALL IT GRIAGON ALLY OMG
I’m pretty sure the hermits will be overjoyed to get deepslate at those prices… it is a *hassle* to mine lol.
Suggestion: Grianway
6.9 subs nicce
bdouble100 also sell deepsplate
This vid was the most dodgy Grain vid I've ever seen, first add some wonk, then place your swag here... Maybe I've just got one of Those minds :) Edit : You can swap one letter out in each and it's... well... yeah.
Griangots
Grain mabey u could make the g train go through the ali
I think you should've got a netherite pickaxe before mining for deepslate, would've been faster
hey grian the big building in ur build can be something to do whit the meeting of boatem inc.
I have an idea you should use the empty cart as a limited item cart like limited edition stock
are you doing that goblin bank?
Grian: misses creeper  Me: *panic*
call your alley way wonkalley or cavalley
Dagrian ally
Might want to build an arrow so that scar doesn’t accidentally build a flying mountain
14:34 "Doesn't that have curse of binding on it?"
“Caveagon alley” it sounded cooler in my head 😅😂🤣
F
Petition to name it "diamond alley"
Griagon alley or Griagonally
Call the alley "Downtown", Because it's down underground, and it's a nice name for a base
2 hours ONLY got me six shulker boxes of deepslate
You should put in a safety lid on the boatem hole to avoid embarrassment
Grian call the Alley, the G-Alley
pog
A cool tip for builds like your base is putting floating candles to give it magic ambientation
Why not call the alley the "Galley" in keeping with your other puns?
Mumbo: Steals Grian's stuff. Me: Uhhh.... Did you switch places because is specifically remember you making K.G.O.O.M.R back is Season 7 for the only purpose of keeping Grian's hands to himself.
You should call the alleyway the Eggcellent alleyway and I should be a secret cave with the shrine to pottery man in it
They should really put a child safety gate on the boatem hole
slightly wonky alleyway
You should call the alley the grian gang alley
You should build Griangotts bank.
Grianon ally is a good base name
Grian if you use an anchanted gold pickaxe on depslate you could insta mine it
You can can Call the alleyway the all-G-way
The Boatem Hole has cause more grief than any person in any server.
the alleyway should be called the crook
Oh no, I disliked! Must be lag.
With all that wOnk you could name the ally Wonkally
The name shall be gallyway/galley
Maybe you can name it Grainaly(gray-naly)
Grain: getting stuck on the wool outline Grain also: getting rid of it
You should called the alleyway alley potter
name it grove street
Call the alley diagon valley
Botem Hole - 2 Grian - 0
A good name for the alleyway is George
Why not name the base cavegon alley?
Gria-gon Alley
Call it the Galley
I think he should definitely call it "Horizont-Alley"
Who on earth thought it was a good idea to let Grian and Scar live in such close proximity to both each other and a literal hole into the void
Name idea: Vertic-Alley  Or something like that
Ooh, build idea, what if you put the mayors office/building whatever from season 7, inside and at the end of your tunnel, except this time, it will be Mumbo's, since he's the CEO of The Boatem Village
Ally name: Wonky walk
Instead of calling in the alley call it the AG Ali and then you know so like the G train?
This season you should make an item sorter so you can actually store your items instead of making the chest monster again
Horizont-alley
Suggestion for Grian: do the bank at the end. Name it Grian-gotts as a play off Gringots, the wizarding bank
can we just agree that grian has the best time laps music out of everyone
Imagine big town
name the bank "griangotts" lmfao
Should have been slim spady
He did it again... he started another war
10:04   Me: It shold'nt be hard, after all you are an expert on building diagonal
"Its not about the dying, its about sending scar a message"
When Grian joined hermitcraft i thought it was great because he was an amazing builder, turns out i was only half right, or should i say front right?
Boatagon Alley
Naming idea: horizontalley
he should make a train station and the  g train goes into it
I feel like I already watched this episode 💀
Scar is building clouds maybeee
(7:53) In a way, this just got very dark.
You should call it blockerton alley
How about we name it GRIAGON ALLY
Call it horizont alley :troll:
The boatem hole easily has the highest kill count
Hey Grian, the alley way your making is all crooked and diagonal and everything.  So i think it would be really cool to call it _Diagon_ Alley
If you haven't got a name for your alley, try Horizont Alley
*Wonk*
I HAVE A NAME IDEA FOR THE ALLY WAY  THE GRA-LLY WAY
that said...there's a mod called "forgiving void, I think it is? where you fall into the void, and like Portals, it spits you out at world ceiling, and you fall down, again till you land on something solid,...or liquid.  so more than likely you do die, but at least the void doesn't swallow your full enchanted netherite gear, whereupon you ragequit because you don't wanna get it back.
can we just appreciate how good grian photographing skill  is?
is it just me or is grian way more on the offensive lately like geez XD
10:04 Callback to Grian’s Mansion (OG one)
Maybe call the ally twisted turn ally
FINALLY A VIDEO WITHOUT THE SEX BOT IN THE COMMENTS
Name your alley: the YOU SHALL NOT pass. Get it? Because its basically a pass…
u should name the alleyway “La Ruelle” (it’s the alleyway in french)
Everything you built after the first day looks way to normal. I would never notice anything weird about them.
The second half of this episode had me laughing so hard to the point of running out of breath!
Subscribe to grian
call the bank "griangotts"
Make the end of the alley Griangotts with a huge G on the front.
6.9 million subs, nice
Grian I looked at the video and scar walked off of the cobble
"It was just a prank"
Tally away is a good name
at the beginning of the season i said, watch him put something big at the end of the tunnel. I was right
Just added a little  W     O     N     K
May I please suggest the name as grains shopping ghetto
Just added a bit of wonk  - Grian 30 Aug 2021
What a disastrous ending of a deal
Make gringots for the bank
Grumbot
name it straight ally
*W O N K*
Good video I like your channel
Grumbot
call the alley the "UnderWay", its underground and its an alleyway
Episode 3 of asking for wizard villagers running round the alley
Grian, mate, buddy, pal, you're copper dam is stupid, you need to spread out the copper and it will oxidize faster!!!
/gamerule keepinventory true ?
I looked at your subs how succesful you are And you have 6,9mil im really happy for your succes :D
Griagon Alley?
You should sell train carts on the g train, like either rent or a permanent thing, and then other people can build there own shops attached.
The best part of the day! Watching a Grian video!
Deepslate limited time event
Griagon alley - Alley Name
Name the alley grian Don alley
The new buildings are giving me Napstablook and Mettaton house vibes
The word wonk is also used by the wof roblox community when were too lazy to type wing ;_;
season nine...holes to the void are ILLEGAL.
The alley decends underground... So why not call it Decendalley?
This episode was hilarious 😂😂😂
G-TRAIN SALES ON RAILS
Please can the people of your comments have a grumbot
I genuinely read it as shagg too
You know it’s the best when your three hermits post in the span of two days
Oi m8 suggestion you could call rhe alley the botem valley alley
I think you should've name this episode "WoNk" 😂😂😂😂😂
Hay! How about G-agon alley for the name? Leave a like if you agree!  (the video and the comment... Just to be clear 😉😅)
Ali’s way is what you should name the alley
Technosupport
so you went to universal
Its griagonalley
6.9 mil nice
I think scar should build in between u and mumbo
hey grian, name the ally, Horizontal ally, like diagonally but horizontal.
*307 thouseand facepalms*
Call it gria-gon alley
He should name the alley Molley... A combination of mountain amd alley.
vsdnc<snbdifvdxc                                                     lol
What about G-agon ally for the name?🤨
I dont think the street should be wide, it ruins the purpose. Even if you cant appreciate the full beauty of each building, you cant in the real Dygon Ally either. I feel like its a sacrifice that needs to be made
Someone should point out to Grian that no one wants actual Deepslate... people want Deepslate Cobble.  You literally have to place all of that deepslate and break it into cobble to make anything out of it.
Alley name idea The Gallery
GG Grian for become Runner up at MCC
Name the ally the grally
this bottomless hole was such a good idea
I just loved the whole trident interaction between Grian and Scar, with the "oh no" response being hilarious
I HAVE A NAME IDEA FOR THE BASE. THE BACKISGONE ALLEY
Grian stole mumbos 2 brain cells
Grian make a locomotive for your train
You should add water to the copper dam
This is one of the best hermitcraft episodes fight me
KARMA!
Diagon alley, vertic alley, horizon(t) alley
I was thinking u would make a valley and surround the village and add paths and stuff to give it a towny feeling.
Alleyway de Griande
Griagon ally
OOF XD
Thats WONK
6.9 MILLION subs lets goooooo
Name idea for the alley, the G-alley, or just the Galley
Bro
I am a fan of mumbo And grian and I think it would be lovely if grumbot Is in season eight of hermit craft
When you realise called you out for being original about naming your pickaxe flinty (7 months ago)
you could call the alley way "The Grainbles", because I think the place that you took the inspo photos was on a road called "The Shambles" in York
some name ideas i have for the alleyway: gri-agon alley vertic alley or horizont alley boatem alley
How about maybe you call the alley "Griaggonalley"
You should call the unamed ally way. The wonk way
How can scar be so smart, and yet so so dumb?
Grian: then I will build the big building here  Me knowing it is diagon alley inspired: Griangotts
Karmra
Grian. been thinking about the name of your street and i think it needs to be quirky and ye olde. how about "Wonky Nook" or "Banks Grove" or "Grotto Row". thoughts?
'Why did you stock pile deepslate?"  Grian: hello I like money
What about Scar's hat???? D:
grian has got to be the most chaotic hermit there is
Ooga booga
Hey grian, you should build the mayors office from season 7 at the bottom of the cave
Again
Grain name the ally The Giagan alley
Name for the ally: Boatagon Ally
Grian go buy Scar a perhaps you perished parcel and think about what you did!
Maybe the alleyway could be called diagrain alley, cuz grain was Gs breadst friend last season
I think you need the potato boy to do the deepslate mining
Boatem! More like Boat-omnomnomnom
Hey grian, call it griagon alley!
I bet every dollar I got someone is going to make a compilation of how many times someone has fell into the Boatem Hole
lol we finally got the mining off camera joke on hermith crew
You guys remember ninjago? I was there for the first episode. I remember when Kai thought he was the Green ninja. Then next thing you know it's the villains son. What a twist! I had almost every Lego set. Even the golden dragon. Back when it was new.  I play on Xbox and I didn't know that Lego ninjago has a game. It's $50 so I don't think I'm getting it anytime soon. But I heard it was really good. And I'm thinking about getting it.   I thought someone should know that Lego Ninjago has a game. Anyway that's all I had to say. Bye.
The boatem hole was a (funny) mistake, and here all the proof you need.
Name for the alley Griagon alley
grain change your minecraft to lolcat
This server without Scar being... well scar would not be nearly as fun.
The bought’em corporation. Needs that name tho
Why don't you call the alley "grainstreet"
Malley Mountain Ally
the alley needs to be called "later-alley". a pun on both Diagon Alley and diagonally. I think it fits ;) please do your thing comments and let grian see this :')
What about the Grally?
You just need to walk around without anything
Heres a neme for the alley: The GG alley (Great Grian Alley)
It is my birthday and I just found out I have covid   Best present ever
Can you do a tutorial on how you make your buildings for your "diagon alley"
You and my friend have something in common...
Grian, you should name the bank Griangotts after Gringotts
Petition for Grian to be the Loki variant of Hermitcraft.
i love how he said "only 6 shulker boxes of deepslate"
That hello at 20:12 is hilarious
your a wisard grian
I normally don’t like videos unless they make me laugh or if I really like their channels but I know how long deep sleep takes to mine and I feel you bro so👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❤️❤️
Call the alley THE "BACK ALLEY" (puns)
Name suggestion: The Galley (Puns!!!) as a name for the 'Alley'
You have 6,9 million subs... Nice
2:45 GRINGOTTS!!!!
I don't know if the G-Train is a good successor to the Barge. It should be something more nautical. Like a G-Alley ;)
Add sheep and ally barbar
the alley should be named grigon alley  (like so grian see's)
Build your shag here
right now.. boatem looks like a "build a mountain" competition... and Grian is losing.. badly :D
you should name the ally diagon alley
🥚
Grian you should name the alley diagonal alley. To go with the puns for the season.
Scar’s nametag ….the “me” at the end of Time and the “W” at the start of With spelled “meW” and he was wearing the cat head I Can’t unsee it
You should call the alley mountain view Edit: cos it’s in a mountain
Alleyway names (this will be edited when i think of more): The Boatem Alley The Alley Of G-Train
I wonder why scar was asking for ender pearls if he "had" rockets.
Tri-dent in my bank account
It's blast resistant, but if you dig a tunnel and line it with TNT it's still more efficient. I fill up a box in 10 minutes
what if you called the alleyway the Gralley?
Name it the horryzont alley
Call the alley griagon alley
YOU SHOULD MAKE GRINGOTTS BANK (excuse my spelling if I spelt it wrong )
Hmmm. Is this slowly become Mt. Boatemoore?
Alternative title: Instant karma
that genuinly hurt...
no one: grian:lets jump into the video
And diagnnally for the name of the alley!
Only on Hermitcraft can you say "only" in front of "6 shulker boxes"
The diamonds you find while mining deepslate could subsidize the cost a little bit, so you can make your price more appealing!
Boatagon alley would be a cool name for your alley way now that you guys are building a gigabase...
GRIAN NAME THE ALLEY “GRIAGON VALLEY!”
king of wonk
8:08 How dare you say mean words to the Barge. The Barge is nostalgic
The big building at the bottom of grians base conatain… (wait for it)… the highly secure ULTIMATE boatem vault for all the PRESTIGIOUS boatem corporation’s diamonds. That would be so fitting imo, Mumbo could make a super over the top, ridiculously secure vault to keep all the profits in. You could use it like a real bank where people put diamonds in and then make withdraws from their accounts. That would be really fun, and also would keep ur base full of hermits to talk to.
Off camera mining...hmmmm... sus Very hermitcrafty
Name the alley the grand alley and then shorten it to G-alley or Galley
Srar likes to overthink things. Scar in the meantime building even bigger "waggon".
I love your video
Two words: Wagen Alley
the alley should be called something like amethyst alley and could have an amethyst bank at the end. or something along those lines.
Your deal there for deepslate there, shouldn't the discount apply a little later? Instead of like, 2 for 3 you've like, 4 for 6, or 6 for 9? Seems like an awful lot of work to give 25% off after the first stack
You could name the alleyway griagon alley
Every season he just gets more profitable!
6.9 M subs. Just 1 word. NICE
Grian does not want to build the back of the Cliff (please dont say this will end like season 7 mansion)
Jeez... this server is laggy.
scar HOLEd on     hahahahahahaha
Were you been vacuuming while recording about deepslate? Or my earphones are broken... (Sorry for poor grammar)
You could name the alley “The Alley That Shall Never Be Named”
oh look a new grian episode full of blackmail, stealing and sacrifices to the boatem
Skar:     :( Me: F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F
Maybe when your alley is finished you should ask Cleo for some armorstand magic.
I have an idea of what to name the "alleyway".  Graineway.  Like if you agree 👍
1:20 felt on a spiritual level
You should make one of the buildings a candy store, for reference look up largest m&m store. Maybe it could sell  gapples, rock candy(Amythest) cookies, cake, etc
"The G-allyway" would be a good name!
"always watch grians new uploads"  - Chun Li, War of Art
Wonk
Diamond Grain Alley (DiaGrain Alley)
Ey Grian! You should make a video on stuff you’d like to see in 1.18 or just the future of Minecraft. Love your videos, keep it up man.
He needs to name the bank griangots bank to keep the pins going this season.
I am loving the interactions this season. I can't think of an episode where I didn't tear up laughing. 🤣
What about the name wonkey alley
The botem hole is a  M A S S I V E  safety hazard
Grain Alley ( not Grian alley Grain alley )
Grian should call the alleyway the wonkway
Name for the base  -under rock alley
I too have problems with spelling definitely XD
Scar: I'm so hurt, I even had a trident on me. Grain: Does somebody sell tridents? Scar: I do. :) Grain: bruh
you should call it the G-Alley or Galley to match the g-train
What about this name for the alley?: The wonky way
The title is worse than losing your progress in Minecraft
I know it's early in the season to say this but next seasons shop should be a plane.... wait... the G-Plane
I just love your interactions with Scar, it warms my heart everytime, Scar is a wonderful creator and seeing having so much fun with you is wonderfull!
the lag teamed with karma
Grian plunging into the void trying to save Scar gave me 3rd Life Final episode flashbacks.  The friendship and loyalty these two actually have is Everything.
Sell deepslate-ores, maybe?
I have an idea for the name of the alley: the gralley (grian + alley).    Sorry
i got a name for the alleyway "ThE WoNkEy WaY"
I wonder if a netherite pick would have help speed it up slightly.
Scar - “i’m a kitty cat.” Me - FURRY Btw love your content.
I LOVE YOUR VOICE
The alley should be called grians gate
Griagon Alley
16:35 to 16:52 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
we need a counter for the boatem hole victims
Call the alleway:'The Ali-A'.
Ahh lag lag
2nd time of telling Grian: call it DiaGrian Alley.
Hermigonally
To fill the streets I suggest some carts, stalls, and armor stands peddling their wares. Try employing cleos help later.
Has anyone pitched "Magicalley" yet?
You could call your base "Angular Abbey" or "Angular Alley" or "Wonky Way"
6.9 mil noice
We're gonna need a whole Boatem Hole Kill Count by the time this season ends lmao
Griagon Alley?
How about calling it the g - cave?
He should call the all the giga grally
You should totally call the gigabase “Boatem Mountains”, and the back story is that it’s a tourist spot, famous for its amazing candy. And the tourist are carried around by the G-train.
Griagon Alley?
The Boatem pole hole is very hungry it seems.
Grain needs to build an trainstation an make a netherportal leading to peron 9 1/2
wen he is done with the allyway the episode is cald funally instad of finaly
Boatem hole 2 - Grian 0
How about Wonky Way as a name?
it SHOULD be more expensive, Grian. cobble generators are easy. it's not cobble. it's harder, newer, more pretty. I'd value it about the same as logs, yah.
No one: Grian: *wonk*
U should make thomas the tank engine with a grian face as the train itself pulling the g-train
"Judge i swear i'm not a cat"
The *Griagonal alley*
Call the ally way mountalwonkey
My like just lagged into your video... weird.
the alley of wonk
Named for the alley suggestion:Diagon Alley maybe
He should call the alleyway the shambles, because he never built the back of any house and that is a shame.
Call the alley the grally
Me the 5,309th commenter: Ah yes I am the chosen one
Lol
Diagrian alley? Dragrian alley?
You should call it the diagonal alley lol
Boo says grian for the millionth time scaring scar
If u give a Scar a death counter he will break it as it hits 18462648263864
Boatem Ally Shall be the name for the Allyway
I miss the barge 😟❤️
suggestion: make the final build a giant clocktower
why grian why why why why grian whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Name the alley ..The Galley, a mixture of alley and grian
Every two episodes grian must lose everything
Grian : 6.9 Million Subscribers  Me : Hehehe
Gonetest items?
Conveniently I just died in the void and lost my maxed out armour in the void
I think you should name it anarchy alley or some thing similar
I want them to put shaders on hermitcraft  so bad
I friken love Grian 😂
Call it dragon egg alley, and have a monument for the egg
call the ally way galley way or name it galley way pls.
Nostalgia season 7 grumbot should be a build in your season 8 Megabase
he should male a prank shop. people come and press a button and out pops a random prank that grian will help you plan like get rid the floor in an area and replace it with pigs and stuff like that
I think Grian should call the alleyway the gralley way
When tow boatem buddys meat another, what would they do? They sacrifice themselfe in the boatom hole, losesing every item they have in the process... I think this kind of action might be a ritual for the boatem gods or something else or why they doing this again and again
would be cool to see some height variety of the buildings in the alley
6.9m subs
Mumbo just traded like 6 stacks of copper for A BEACON, well done Grian
name the alley horizont alley
The griangotts bank!
Slide into the middle of the waterfall sitting on The armchair
grian has 6,9 mil subs, nice
You should keep the deepslate shop, but just keep raising the prices until it's worth it to you. This isn't about being reasonable. This is about supply and demand.  If it takes raising the price to 10 diamonds per stack, SO BE IT!
The Boatem hole is the best thing
"Griagon Hallway" should be the name for the alley
Not kinda lie feels like Grain has just been bullying the other Boatem Hermits into doing what he wants...
congrats on 6.9 mil
CALL IT DI-GRIAN ALLEY
The name of your alleyway should be "The unnamed alleyway"
chill
The G-train will soon turn into the G-plane
Petition for grian to make a bank and call it "Griangotts"
Etho sells tridents
You need to make Griangotts. You have too.
The grally Way xD
Grian definetly had good planning by getting a good villager set up.. it makes replacing armour sets so much easier!!
Grumbot fans assemble
I would like to see grian to just have all these tall and wonky buildings in the ally way to build just a lil ol house in one of the spaces :D
Your style is the best i ever seen in many time.
Diagon alley sounds like diagonally, so what if he called it Horizont alley or Vertic alley?
Botem ally
Name for The ally way The Alley = Thalley
6.9 Million Subscribers.. 😂🤣
Will there be a knockturn alley?
Why not add some market stalls to fill the space in the alley??? Also, any tips on how to build like this? As I would hugely appreciate it as i could use a very similar style for my gotham city if you dont mind. Thanks
you should make extensions for the train that people can rent and have their shop there
I've just been calling the alley Griagon Alley in my head
Mumbojumbo is always stealing your becan
Call it the "Gralley"
Next season grian should make a shop that is a plane
Name it wonky pass or maybe griagon ally
Maybe name it Horizont Alley?  Like horizontally  Instead of diagonally like diagon alley
When you *finally* finish your alley, you could as well just call it "The Fine Alley"
Here is a name for the ally. Hermiton ally
for the name how about "horizont-alley" 8:26
9:57 he sounded a lot like mumbo for a moment there 🤣
Build grumbot as a build in your megabase
Heres an idea of what to call your base... griagonally
Grian's season 9 shop will be the G-plane, and its a massive plane filled with shops. as he expands the G-plane, he just makes it longer and longer
Stupid name for the alley, HermitCranny... it sounds wrong.
Hey grian!! you did great at last MCC really proud of you and so cool how much you have raised for thr charity
Diagrian Alley could work for a name
Grian should name the "ally way" boatem Ally  leave a like if you agree
"Sending Scar a message"  Grian: Turf War flashbacks
So, uh, nobody else going to ask about whether he's going to name the "bank-like building" at the end of the alley "Grian-gots Bank"?
Well think of the positive, Scar was able to get the cat head off.
*grian ends up killing scar accidentally   Me: Third life flashbacks
Only 6 shulker boxes of deepslate.                          Normal people: yes!! my first shulker box!!!
It should’ve been tri dent in my finances
The man that started two wars died once more...          wow
at the end of the hallway make a round plaza and at the end of it make the main building
You should call your base Dillyd Ally!!  (Like Dilly Dally, similar to how Diagon Ally is diagonally)
You need to build grumbot as a build in your megabase
Alley Name Suggestion: Griagon Alley. (Pronounced gree-ah-gon)
The alley should be DaBlocky Alley or something along those lines as a play of diagon alley (however you say it)
"Doesn't that have curse of binding on it?" KILLED ME 😂😂😂😂
I watched Mumbo's video and saw him take you Beacon and was wondering of he asked you or not 🤣
Grally
U could name it starboard port which is ship directions for diagon alley u get it ship because boatom
My friend said I build pretty well and said they wished they could build so I just told them the magic was to just watch some Grian Vids. Tellin you, this mans magic
In season 9 we should remove all the void holes away for grian and scars
You should randomly put in just a little funny clip at the end of random videos just like rewarding people who stick until the end every video. It wouldn't have to be every video, only like 1 out of 10 or so
Grian you could call the alley gralley way
The alleyway should be called Horizont Alley
*Grian digging down to get to deepslate, just deepslate* No one: Absolutely no one: Diamonds: Oh hi I’m existing now
You said you had to brain cells I have one Braincel
thats the name of the alley "the alley way"
maybe names for alley that I thought of (mostly of cats, coz of Maui and Pearl)  all with suffixes from Britain (according to wiki)  :  Merlpbl(a)en  (Mlep, Mlem, Mer, hill) clawdon  (Claw, hill) Lock mearl (river/sea, m(aui)+(p)earl, mer)  Grainporth  (port) Grainwick (Port)  although then again, they are for the name of an entire settlement.. not just an alley or st..
I love how the botem hole just keeps taking peoples lives and not one of them has stopped to consider if breaking the bedrock was a bad idea
The ‘Gra-lley’ ??  Just a thought.  Def better names for the alley way
Graingotts…
nice one grian
I vote for the base to be named *Griangon Alley*
Doesn’t Scar want to build a floating island?
It looks weird without planar fog ngl
Undergrowth Alley? Possible name.
if Grian's s6 base wasn't circular, would he have ever finished it?  probably not.
You should name the alley "The alley of G (or Grian)
Grally road. Grownsville. The G wonder.  Buy one. Get one G. Groewdon ally.  I've ran out of ideas
Grian you should make a Engine for the GTrain. That's what every train always has
for the name of the alley you could do vertical or horizontal alley because diagon alley is kind of like diagonal allley
Last season: barge This season: train Next season: Car?
Hey Grian! What about naming the Alley:  *Valley Alley* or  *The Alley in the Valley*
Instead of diagon ally you should call it diagonally and you can say this is where you appear when you use the floo powder wrong xD
Instant karma
This hole is hazardous.
The alley should be called the wonky walkway
I think someone already made a near automatic farm where you just hold left click
You should name it “wonk alley”
Then we have to add a substantial amount of W O N K
‘I’m a kitty cat’ - Is Scar a furry?
Grain it got only got me 6 shulker boxes of deep slate me stoping at two stacks
Make the name of the alle, G-alley and create a lake with a galley in the middle of it.....
The grally way
Lol
"ally canyon"
Name suggestion for the alleyway: Griagon alley
Griaggon ally
I expected Scar to fall into the hole after getting the enderperl. But Grian too? Didn't laugh that hard in a long time :D
you hit 6.9M pog
The G-alle(r)y
wonk
You should call it “DieAgain Alley” lol and you could kill anyone that enters
The alleyway should be named the Gralley! Grian’s Alley
Name the alleyway "Griagon Alley"
10:40 - me, an Englishman Hmmm
Call it a G-alley and at the bottom build a boat
Since the alleyway is in a video game it could be called polygon alley
Name the Alleyway: GAlleyway
Horizontalley?
i added a bit of wonk😂 grian - 2021
6.9 million!!!
9:57 DID YOU JUST STEAL MUMBOS LAUGH??
“Scar likes to overthink things, so we will make it more clear” The other boater hermits: that ain’t gonna happen chief
Al's Alley. Al-ey/al-ley for short
You should make the councilman office/bank building at the end of your base the Big Boatem Inc building
Name for the ally way the grain way
21:27 Season 8's first big war is about to unfold.
Call the ally way the way of botem
The Boatem Hole is the worst and best idea thus far
"The alley" should be called Griagon alley (pronounced gry-agon alley) get it c- cause Grian and- and Diagon alley? No? Ok sorry.
Imagine the episodes were an hour 😳😳
‘Every time I steal something, I’m going to blame lag’ - what the hell happened here?
Maybe name the alley diagonal alley because the buildings and alleyway are wonky
Hey Grian idk if this would work but would a conduit and a beacon help with mining deepslate faster?
i’m just saying call it the back alley
Grian should play genshin impact
Sally the alleyway
I think the alley should be called Orthogon Alley
G, you should just call the Ally the 'Wonkey Ally'
How about theatric alley
Diagon alley? Never heard of it. Perpendicular alley
Each building should be a HP themed shop. Like selling suits of armour in a building called Madam Malkin's Robes for all occasions, or Quality quidditch supplies where you sell flight related things.
How strange that Mumbos copper ended up into your inventory. Server must be really laggy today.
Petition for the alley to be called "Vertic Alley"
6,9 mil subs pog
Name the alley griagon alley , like so grian sees this
Grian scar will not the back of your base did he last season???
May I make a suggestion for a name for the alley? My idea is Boatagom alley
Deepslate Way. Name the alleyway Deepslate Way
call it grianon ally
The ollivanders building is amazing. Congrats
bruh
Call the alleyway blockagon alley
Grian, you should make a bank, and call it Griangots.
I beg you make the end office building gringotts
Grian: "I do believe Scar is building a mountain."    *Scar literally saying that he's going to make a floating city in the sky* I'ma end this man's whole career.
or just call it sally
Were gonna need a G-Wagon next season
'This is too straight... I'm gonna add a bit of wonk' - God making me
The train is going to be the next barge
I love how when he found deepslate he didn't even notice the diamonds because he has so many he doesn't really care to mine them anymore
If you have mixed feelings about restocking... Up the price. Both you and other Hermits will be happier if you are able to incentivize yourself!
you should name your base the DiaGrian Alley!
Call the alley way Grianagon alley kinda like diagon alley but your name instead on dia
Again Grian?!
It doesnt seem as much to us but the amount of effort that is put into these video's is very large and I just want to thank Grian and the other hermits for the effort they put in.
It should be called the Dele Alli way   ⚽️ glory glory Tottenham Hotspur⚽️
I collected a full shulker of deepslate with no efficiency, I feel ur pain
Grian we just need some short videos called "Messin' with Scar!"
Techno support🐷
Hey Grian what do you think of "the Street of Strangers"
You should have gone with the support theme for scars trident ”tri as hard as you can” “tri your best” or something like that
Techno support🐷
Imma Youtuber with an SMP would you like to join it
Hello
I got a name suggestion for the alley. What about "Aghast Alley" like you know aghast as in scary or horror (its not the best suggestion but it was just an idea that I wanted to toss into the suggestion box 😁)
Much wonk
make a g bank
you should name it Megally, because pun
also i woed like to join hermitcraft some day if you coud tel me how
deepslate should be renewable if your cobblestone gen is bellow y level 0
Lose two sets of player items to profit in scar's build choice WONKS (also call the alley the Gunction, (the g train's junction))
19:18 I MISS THAT SONG hallelujah
How about “the boatem alleyway”
I thought of a name for your base! Hermit Hollow!
GRIAN CALL THE BASE GRIAGON ALLEY GRI-GON
you should have a mod that teleports items lost in the void back to the surface or something like that
Fine Alley
I knew it was grian! Scar filmed a video and he was looking at that and thought it was cub. I knew it was grian!
Downtown Alley?
I lagged into this comment section...odd
Gralley way is a very good name I think
Name idea: the crooked corner
they died...      AS BROS
What about calling the “tha ally” for “diagonal grially”?
"We do it for the Diamonds" - Grian, had over 10 stacks of Diamond**blocks** last season with no use
It's the griagon ally
wonk
"Hermigon Allie"
the botem has been satiated... for now
Can someone tell me how to transfer all of the same blocks from you inventory to a chest please
Why don't you name your base hermiton ally because it's on the hermitcraft server
Name the alley diagonal alley
I think grian should name the alleyway the G Ginnel
Call it the grainally
OMG did this make my day better after having to go back to school! Thanks Grian!
How did you NOT take DAMAGE at the ending of the EPISODE.  like at  the "gooooodbyiiiiii!!!!!!!"
Someone seriously needs to make a compilation of scar getting jump scared
oh boy
Grian: Stocks deepslate   me: *PTSD from my last mega base intensifies*  (it was Isengard from lotr built from deepslate all the way to hight limit)
Scars hat is....
Back of the mansion, now, terrain 🤣
you can call the ally "dave"from cave and gif it a face that wood be cool
DiaGrain Alley 😂
It's okay to lose stuff, we still love you, Grian
Can u make a video of how to make terrain like hills and mountains
name the alleyway "Curved Crossroads"
you should name the alley    alley G :)
Name suggestion for the alleyway  - The Gally
You should build the old sherlock Grian house in the alley
The Boatem Alley
Grian is so evil when it comes to scar
For grian to mine 6 shulker boxes of deepslate in (exactly) 2 hours, he would need to mine one block every 1.44 seconds, this is pretty slow considering he has max efficiency and haste. Although this doesn't count any breaks, and is exactly 2 hours and 6 full shulker boxes. It's still pretty slow for what its worth
A good name for the alley would be the Griagon Alley
How was JUMPING IN AFTER HIM gonna help lmao
put the barge at the back of the base
Alley name suggestion Ok so maybe call it The Back Alley Since you know... it has no back so it's funny
A name for the Ali way should be Mohamed Ali way
Oi Grian! You can enchant full sets of diamond gear at an enderman farm with books and enchanting table in less than half the time :)
Dark Enelly, just me, ok then
XD
HE HAS 6,9 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS NO ONE SUB
Oh my goodness! You need to have a bank at the end of the alley called 'Griangotts'!! 😂
You should name the alley "Alley Valley"
The only notable alley in my region is Post Alley, Seattle WA. I know you’re aiming for more fantastical but some of the images are similar.
6.9 mil subs nice
The inspiration is diagon ally so how about naming it rectangle ally
You👏need👏to🤜build👊your✊terrain
the ally should be called Griangon alley
"...and then the big building at the back" (10:10) Does this mean the Grian wants to live in Griangotts?
name it griagon alley
DiaGrian Alley
sugestion for the name of ur alley it could be the wonk walley or the wonky walley hope this helped :)
Call the the ally the grailyway
Avoidation I call it
18:20 Am I the only one who hears something like a scream?
I have came up with a name idea for your street, I hope you like it :)  Grians great gorgeously gloomy gateway
hi hi hi hi hi hi when was this made oh yes yes 6 hours ago wait was it 1 I think it 6 ima check no it’s 1 sorry :<
GRAIONALEY, like diagonaly, but with a little bit of GRAIN
19:45 yo did grian just say booty 😱😱
adding a litte wonk xD
Me seeing the notification at 2:30 am:I DON'T NEED SLEEP I NEED ANSWER
Give a scar a did you die box in return for building on top of your base
that darn lag!  gg in MCC :)
Name idea  G-agon alley
The alleyway should be called griangonally after diogonally
What if you called the ally grain St????
Hi
hahaha classic mumbo jumbo
Maybe you should name the alleyway the grialley??
Griagon alley should be the name. It's a mix of Diagon and Grian
Grian should call the Alley the "G-alley-ry" cause every building he's making is a work of art.
he's so dumb and it makes me mad
Again….
Please make the trading hall better it’s so dull currently 🥺
Grian:if this isnt the most overdone starterbase idk what is Let me introduce u To scars magic village of the last season
Downtown alley  Beacuse its under a mountain
If it’s based off diagon alley why don’t you call it diagrian alley or something like that.
"I had a trident on meh"  "oh noh"  The slight change in accents got me xD
put water to fill in the space and call it canallley
Copyright alleyway
Grian has 6.9 million subscribers at the time I write this comment. Nice
Hey grian I think you should name the alley “diagrain alley”
This is the best smp on youtube
Griangotts Bank
6,9 million subs….nice!
Omg.  I died at the sacrifice to the boatem.  One day you will all learn not to kill your neighbors, lol
the way you say "wonk" sounds like male special self care in a swedish dialect.
That whole interaction with Scar was *chef's kiss*
That's karma for you Green
Grian u see some deep slate I have over 64000 in my mc hardcore world
Koool
What about scar's hat?
You’ve heard of a megabase, this season is the first gigabase, next season there will be a terabase, where every hermit comes together to make one enormous base
Idk why but the pink house in the ally reminded me of the mycelium resistance 🤔
u keep dying
the Grallyway  yeah, i know it sucks
@Grian Alley Whoops
21:57 AAADHGAWDAND
"This whole alleyway is supposed to be wonky."  Then name it Wonky Way
It would be awesome if you had the dragon on top of gringotts aka the vautlt bank
Has no use for the back as always... Has anyone else noticed that the alleyway buildings don't have a back either
I think maybe underneath the seriously tilted building you should have a wide and short one for a greater variety
How about you add Sherlock homes from  season 6 to your base as one of the buildings?
@grian can you make a tutorial for the train
The worst idea Grian has ever had “build the meeting room over the void”
When Scar didn’t mess up the ender pearl shot, the universe didn’t accept it...
hermits: selling stuff for a few diamonds but if anyone would mine for diamonds they would get way more diamonds in lesser time
You should build a giant building named griangotts at the end
Is anyone gonna tell grian that scar is planning a cloud megabase and not a mountain? So he probably wont be doing any landscaping......
“Now I just have to remember how to active my 2 brain cells and remember how to spell” This is relatable
the galley
Call your alleyway the "Galleyway".
You should absolutely name your alleyway to "Galley G" or something like that.
Name it Dia-grain alley
Hermiwarts street
The DaiGrian alley😮‍💨
at least this clears what happened in bdubs stream last night.....assuming this was last night lol
WONK ALLEY
hi love you
wen einer eine Grube  gräbt fallen zwei hinein
how about naming the alley enchanted alley
Are you planning on making the buildings into shops?
Grian and scar: bunk beds
Lets be honest, Grian was going to end up having to replace Skars stuff again anyway, so he might as well take the 400 diamonds for it while he can.
Stealing Grian's stuff was the first part of Mumbo's plan to anything but now its not an option...
there's a reason why mojang makes bedrocks unmineable but we mankind never learn
Idk if he already reached it already, but congrats at reaching 6.9 million! 🥳🥳🎉👏🤣
The alley way should be named the "Mauiway"
I said this in a previous video, but since the initial inspiration for the Unnamed Alley is clearly Diagon Alley, you should call it something like Vertic Alley or Horizon(t) Alley
I love Scar so much :D
Boogaloo Boulevard
your interactions with scar are just amazing
Name idea for the alley the Grailly PS love ur vids❤️
19:06 SAME MUSIC FROM PREV SEASON: Grian and the villagers
GrianGotts Bank.
The ally should house offices for the members of Boatom and then then bank should be a meeting space for the boater crew
Possible names for the alley: Digrianalley or Diagrianalley.
"Doesn't that have Curse of Binding on it?"... When I say I cackled like Grottbags... 😂 😂
next time call your wings fly fly :)
Dia-grain alley?
we really need black glass over the botem hole so this stops happening there is prolly like a few hundred diamonds worth of stuff in the item hole
Grain you should name it the the Grainagone ally
*Tridon't believe you made me buy this.
good name fore the alley :  The Gally.              grian alley
For that bank you want at the end name it "Griangots"
Anybody remember that magical pig that died? Me neither.
"Happy little *W O N K* "       -Grian, probably...
Grian should name the alley the ‘gralley’
Grain:I need to add more WONK
great humoristic episode xD loved it!
Since you haven’t figured out a name for your base, I feel like “Downtown Boatem” is an alright name. Definitely not the best but I’m just putting it out there
GRINGOTTS at the end of the alleyway!!!!!! 😀
you should really consider have a few extra sets of armor and tools in case things happen
W O N K
Grian dying is like scar living. Idk how it works but still idk.
name the alley 'Diagrian Alley'
Grian plans the Hermapocalypse confirmed
i get off school, i watch hermitcraft :D
The time lapse music has a bit of a Great british bake off vibe.
Call the mountain, Alstone mountain/mt Alstone (pronounced all-stone) and call the ally, Alstone Ally!
Grian drop rocket to save scar but not him self
You should make the deepslate car to be like a hopper rail car rather than a fancy carriage since it does look a bit like coal piles. Could be cool to see a more freight-esque car on the G-Train
ali alley
In the middle at the end you should make the transmitting tower from little nightmares 2 (just a suggestion)
grian should call it vertic alley
it looked like scar jumped just before grian dropped him
GRIAN CALL THE ALLY The UnCovered Ally and say it was previously colapsed and you saved it or somthing idk
please call it diagrian ally
If Grian doesn't build a bank in the middle called Griangotts I'm going to lose my mind.
Another episode Another Zenloss amazing
The cave should be name "Cave Escape"
I got 3rd life flash backs
Erobb alleyway
Love your videos
Name it the Gralley, Grian and Alley put together
Griangots ...my name-suggestion for the bank at the end of the alley
soooo... are you gonna check on your 'son' anytime soon?
hi
i would call the alleyway; Jiglewig alley
Scar will most likely build something that hits build limit, think Mortal Engines
grian i dare you to sell wheat on the g train and call it the grain car on the grain train
He should name it griangon alley like this so grian can see it
He is adding gringots!
the new thing of hermitcraft is the scar war
you HAVE to name it 'horizont alley"
The title made me think... Ah nooooooh.
Diagrian valley'
6.9
You should be CEO of Boatem inc you’ve had multiple successful businesses (the barge and the train) whereas mumbo has had a potato dispenser and odea so…
griagon ally
i have an name suggestion for your alley. prepare your brain for this banger: vaginalley
The g train is good and all but we need another barge
Daieggon ally?
If mumbo is Bruce Wayne Then which alley is this Seems kinda sus
3:22 okay Azula
Goodtimeswithscar fell out of the world Grian, “It was just a prank”
“Look how slow this is” Only hermits can call that slow
*We need a counter for how often someone died falling into the boatem hole*
You can just hear Grians pain in the "Aaaand.. go!" right before the timelapse! XD 5:29
Polygon ally
Man lag is just on Menace to Society now
Lag
Omg I can’t breathe I’m laughing so hard xD “Wonk”
You did really well in mcc16 grian!!
Polygon Ally
Griagon alley is looking nice
I like how 0% of the Hermits dont use chestplast. R.I.P Chestplates
Hey grian, I suggest you name your giga base the boatim shoal
anyone keeping up with the hole's killcount?
The boatem hole has taken hundreds of people... but it's still hungry
Grian is literally *the* most upbeat person in the history of ever. Change my mind...
So, when are you naming the base "Diagrian Alley" ?
That feels so awful for loosing all those stuff. I feel for you.
grian and mumbo are no back buddies lol
And the moral of the story is if you want your friend to do something wait for them to get stuck in a hole
Grians lag speech sounded like technoblade
I hav a col nem de grien wey
Grian in seson 9 gplane
In this season grian is really like an little evil
Wait, wasn't the scar signs already around before, I am really confused...
Diagrian Alley
You should call the Ally “Allyoops”cause of all the oops from the bot em hole.
I have an idea for the G-Train, dedicate an entire carriage to coal, then call that carriage the 'G-fuel'
Gotta admit he has a very *nice* number of subs right now
21:30  Oh no, not another war 😂
I have an idea for a building, you could do one of those small normal looking houses in the middle of some taller buildings (Think Stuart Little)  That has always been one of my favorite type of house desgin
Every time one of these video come out a little of my depression is cured :)
i Think a cool thing for the big building in the middle is the bank from the diagonally
Name suggestion:  "Scarred for life [however short it may be]".  (Axe or Sword, maybe?)
Does anyone else stare out into space with out realizing and someone ask what’s wrong you zone back in and just say do you think I could fight off a wolf?
WonkAlley? Like wonkily. Like DiagonAlley. Like diagonally. :D
He just walked off the edge before you broke the block
Should be known as Die-a-Grian Alley.
Griadon alley
Poor scar, so much pressure on where to build
Giggly- Name of the Valley of buildings
I have a belief that the copper dam will just lag back into mumbos chest
Here is an idea for the alleys name the extraordinary alley
you should call it the griavenue
wait for Grian to realise copper oxidizes faster when they are separate
you should call the alley diagrian alley
I'm always amazed at how Scar manages to keep accidentally putting himself into the worst kind of predicaments.
LETS GOOOO 13
Grian: mines for 2 hours Hxpixel skyblock players: first time?
💀
Or Diagrian Alley
boatem hole: yummy Grian :)
Suggestion for Grian: get a cat. Name them the alley cat. Leave them in the alley. Enjoy as hermits find the cat's name
Grian hangs out to much with Mumbo .... he have also only two braincells (1:19) ...
Grian: *breaks the blocks under Scar when Scar doesn’t have rockets* Also Grian: *chases Scar into the boatem hole to give him rockets but dies and loses everything in the process*
6.9 mil subs woooooo
At season end, someone needs to do a graphic or video on the Boatem Hole's kill count.
if you space out your copper from each other then it will oxidize a lot faster
Brah, pun-gent puns anyone?
........ you chased after him, huh...
Mumbo has Grians back of base syndrome at the moment!
Alley name idea: Griagon Alley
The botem hole is so rich by now
Ah yes, the Grannyway
Somehow grians timelapse music is even more lively at 1.25x speed
Alley way suggestion! "Slate Alley"
The name for the alleyway should be New Kelp City
Here's a name for the alley.   GRIAGON ALLEY!

Unlucky episode 13
Grian should add the houses from the house wars from season 6
@Grian Are you building Diagon Alley?
Grian: scar likes to overthink Meanwhile, me thinking about the optimal outcome and aftermath after being asked a would-you-rather question: *nervous sweating*
6.9 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS POG!
vids glitching
there you go perfect name "Wonky Alley"
It’s all lag
Wonky walkway
I know its not a good name for the Ally way but "the gally way"
Just gonna say "Griagon Alley" sounds cool-
"Nobody wants to farm [deepslate]" No, this would be why *everyone* would want to farm it, but it can't be farmed and so nobody wants to *scavenge* it
So there is no shopping district yet Grian said last episode that they want to make Boatem the shopping district. Grian is creating Diagon Alley soooo, that could be the new shopping district??
you know, what if cobble generators instead made deepslate below a certain y-level? that would make for an easy enough method to automate it, and could make sense
Sheesh I missed all the hermitcraft series
12:57 TikTokers be like
Build Gringots at the back of the alley way
so I know that the sewer cats were last season.. but maybe we get to see the alley cats this season?
Congrats on 200 episodes of Hermitcraft
Did someone already suggest „Grianon-Alley“ ?

Impulse should add a giant drill that is drilling into mumbo's base
It’s so funny how scar wanted 5 of them grian then said no walked away scar said 500 diamonds and grian instantly comes back to except the offer
"Wonk"
Prayers for groan this episode he lagged a lot
Scar saying 10 times he doesn’t have rockets but grian doesn’t give a f*ck
You are really going to make Scar do the back of your build AGAIN?
Anyone else thought grian made a building out of bedrock??
grian: "scar likes to over think things"  me: im in this video and i don't like it
8:07 how dare you insult the barge like this

Grian call the ally way the 'Gally' (Griain ally) and have a boat in it
DiaGRIAN ally
12:38 you sounded like JackSucksAtLife
name idea:  allmystuffgon alley
Grians base is the opposite of a tardis, it looks big on the outside and small on the inside
name the alleyway "Griagon alley"
Jumping to boatem hole is a way of sealing a deal.
why is everyone building a mauntain
You should name the ally "the ginnel" just to confuse the not British
The Barge, the G Train, I swear next season is going to be an airship or something….
Nice
That’s so sad
I would definitly call the alley "The Gigalley", whats better for the first ever Giga Base of hermits
Can we call the allyway "Jezzas ally"?
i think the botem village should have a football match or something against the other hermitts which means building a stdium which i think should be apart of your mountains
Ask Mumbo to create a TNT Duping flying machine to mine deepslate
we need griangots bank at the end of the alleyway
The ‘ollivanders shop’ shop sell wood because of the actual shop selling wands/sticks
Name it diagonally

Call the alley "La Gallerie"
"It was just a prank."
You could call the alley alleyway the G-Street
You're going to need some small alleys in the alleyway so you can keep getting good wide views.
You should build a sewerage with really small buildings beneath your alley and call it the gully alley. (or a turned around and dirty alley with buildings on the ceiling)
"the ally-cave" would be a great name for the base don't you think?
Grian be like: you should’ve read the fine print, my friend.
OMG here's an idea sell renamed sticks as wands and sell parrots and stuff (maybe like 1 diamond and parrots maybe like 3
I cried from laughter on Grian's reaction after they both died in boatem hole XDDD
Grian you can use an axe to remove one layer of oxidisation from the copper
Make a james bond themed bank please
Dunno why but my brain thinks “Alley Wonky” is a good idea for a name for your base Rolls off the tongue smooth  though. Or  “Galley Cove” since you know ur in boatem and a galley is a kind of ship/boat, its also can mean Grian’s alley like with the g train  :thonk:
Scar is such a beautiful agent of chaos :')
Make there in tthe middle the boaem council

I like how Scar’s name has “mew” in it and he’s wearing a cat head and stuck in a hole like a real life cat that’s gotten itself in a pickle.
The grealy
Hermiton Ally
Hi Grian, really good vid as always, but whats the music for your timelapses ?
That moment when grian walks in and you hear scar sadly say- "hello?"
A good name valley alleyway
This is the best thing to watch while working on my fakemon region
Name for the alley  Cavernally
Here's a name suggestion for the alley:  Diamon alley (pronounced like diagon but with a Minecrafty flavor)
When I was a kid, probably 6. All of my friends names started with j, we called our self the j train.
You should call the alley "G-Alley" or Jelly for short 😉
Oh, man. Lag is a menace on this server. So let's thank Nord VPN for sponsoring this comment. Not only does it protect your personal data, but it allows you to connect to servers all over the world, fixing latency problems. Thank you, Nord VPN, for being today's sponsor.  Also, consider building your "build here" sign in diamond blocks as a bribe for Scar.
If this season doesn't ending with all the boatom crew jumping one last time in the boatom hole (maybe together) I will be very disappointed 😤😤😤🤣🤣🤣
It takes longer for copper blocks near eachother to oxidize so seeing grian putting them together asking why it takes so long bothers me
oh no grian will start another war if he doesn’t do something before the copper oxidizes 😰
Mojang should make it so that via mason villagers you can get deepslate for emeralds
Why am I never surprised when Grian or Scar dies..
No one:  Grian: I added a bit of a wonk
An idea for the name of your base could be hexagonal street. You know diagonal street but 3 dimensional like Minecraft is!
he added *wonk*
you should make the carriage with the deepslate a thing where wants it's gone it's gone, but whenever one item runs out you could put up a new one. that could make people come more often to see what the new stuff is and then while they are there they might as well buy some other things.
This made my day. I laughed so many times
2 DIAMONDS... FOR A STACK?!??!? AAAAAH WHY IS HERMITCRAFT SOOO CHEEEEEEEEAAAAAPP
Here me out: Toad Alley. You get an excuse to build a big frog in the alley AND it’s a play on the word “totally”

what if you named your base Wonky Way Alleyway
Alleway name idea: Griagon alley
Please add a bank at the end of the alley  called griangotts
What if the valley is called i ona valley, it would fit in with the terriible pun theme
Horizon alley. Like instead of diagonal, diagon, horizontal horizon.
Grians almost to 7mil
I agree grian, I hate mining for deepslate and I know because I sell deepslate on the server I play in aswell haha.
The G-train alleyway
I was so happy just to see this on my home page I love this season for some reason more then others
[This comment lagged into this comment section.]
I think you should build griangotts, like gringotts but grian
I still would like to see a bank, like gringots, at the end of the alleyway  :3
You should of named the trident tri-dent in my wallet
how about Horizont Alley
Why does he sell Deepslate? Isn't it just easier to mine for Diamonds yourself?   But okay you said it will be stupid and it is very, VERY stupid!!

Call The Alleyway “The G Way”
Hi
"I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse."  Immediately creates the circumstances of refusal.
Name it Boatagon alley
on my single player hardcore, I made  a zombificating trading hall that could do 12 full sets of fully enchanted an hour, provided you can manage to complete all the trades twice in a Minecraft day. it had a copy of each piece of enchantment for each piece of gear that needed it in a set, plus a trader for the base gear. I only used it the one time, still have a few sets laying around.
Griangon Ally  np
I think u can mine deepslate by exploding if bc it has the same blast resistance as stone
Think of it this way .. 2 hrs of deepslate farming also gets you a bonus of 2 stack diamonds .. You can't get that while farming sand, wood, terracotta etc
1.17/Mojang: doesn’t put mountains in it’s original update Hermits: ya want something done ya gotta do it yourself
I got a name for grains base what about diagon grianary
why
I believe this is the third time groan killed scar ‘on accident’. He didn’t mean for him to die…😂
griagon ally
When he bribed scar then fell into the void  Karma that was karma
Wait, I thought that the base name was already decided to be “Dia-Grian Alley”...
Wonky donk street?
I (17) am wearing a Sahara t shirt and my web design teacher recognised it. :)
On this episode of HERMITCRAFT, Grian spends a lot of time doing nothing productive!
Name the alley “The Wonk Way” like “The Walk Way”
The ✨Griagonally ✨
You should do a livesteam when you are grinding.
My message lagged into the comment section
Hi guys I might have covid just wanted to say
Ah yes the wonk
Place your shag here xD
Scar wants to build a cloud city
The valley should be named the slopay becouse it is a slope and a alley
I have a name for your ally just call it the wonk ally
Literally this episode is full of me rewinding to find out how things suddenly got bad and almost all of them are Scar and Grian being precious little shits
Is there coming g-train merch?
Hey Grian, could you please make a tutorial on something like the deep slate building. I’d love to have that as a base.
Call it the heptagon alley, like the diagonal alley, but heptagon!
Might I suggest Amor Ally for the name of your base, which would have the double meaning of “Love Ally” (when translated to english) and “Amorally” (having no sense or concern for doing the “right” thing)
Hey grian how are you I was wondering If you could come onto my world and help me make my house look nice
Grian got the booties
Griangon Alley
Instead of diagon  you should do octagon alley
For a name for the alley. As u are basing it of diagon alley he should call it.  -Perpendicular Alley
Hopefully we get fred and George's joke shop, can't remember the actual name but would be cool
If you make a bank, you must name it Grians-Gotts
I love how on episode 11 and 13, he loses everything
I thought someone else was in charge of planning...
grian should call it “Horizont Ally”
“Yeah, I need help.” Oke! Let me help- Pushes* YOUR AN IDIOT. “So, can you help m-“ no
Grian: Scar will build here and i won't have to do back of my cave. Scar: Builds a cloud castle
Hermits should really learn what the point beyond return is. By the way the point beyond return is the void
Ayoooo 6.9 million subs nice job!!!
You should call it griagon alley
You could call the alleyway the galleyway instead because alleyway+ G for grian  I know it's a bit dumb bit I find it funny XD
let me help you naming the alley~~~ it will be "Galley"
That void hole is starting to remind me of the 11foot8 bridge, people just keep crashing into it
Grian, you should name the alleyway as "O'Malley's Alley." I hope it's a good idea.
You might need to use Mumbo Jumbo’s ender pearl stasis chamber
this episode was uneventful
TWO GEODES!!!
Youre base name could be "The grally way"... (This was a terrible joke)
"Ally" is a beautifull name for a base  just keep it that way
Grian you should make gringots at the end of the ally
Since your very succesfull shops recently have been  'transport' themed, in season 9 you should set up a 'G-plane' in the sky!
scar caused both ur deths
How about you call the alley the gralley?
Why not call it vertic-ally or horizont-ally
Thanks for the video Grian!!
It should be called the "Grian Get away"
griangon alley
The bank should be called “griangotts”
noctun ally

How About boaton alley
Wonk wonk wonk wonk wonk wonk wonk wonk wonk wonk
Alley name suggestions,  bobbits alley.  Like bits and bobs but backwards
the bank at the end should definitely be called "Griangotts"
This whole episode was just pain to Grian
When you don't buy anything when you go to the G-train: *run.*
Grian talk with etho for the trident
Boatem needs a town hall
I saw this at 00:00
U should call the ally the gally
It's my birthday today  And I got grian best birthday present ever
Hey grian for season two of 3rd life you should put a bed In an enemies base so when you die/get killed you can spawn in their base. Just an idea.
ill be honest "the ally" is a pretty good name for your base
I think it would be really cool if at the big building at the end of the alley you could turn left or right and there be a little loop that takes you back around with some more buildings lining that with some significant wonk too :)
Grian I have a suggestion for you! Can you change your channel logo/Profile and make it look better?
How bout calling it diagram alley
The Gralleyway lol
he wanted to make a flying cloud base/city actually.
I think you should name it wonky way
you should call it the gally. The Grian alley
“If I can convince him to build here I won’t have to build the back of the terrain“ is probably one of if not the most Grian thing I’ve heard in a good few months
I really hate when the copper lags into my inventory!
Why just why
u should add a abandond house into the ally idk it would fit the theme
Making a hole to the void was a mistake. Deciding to make the hole larger was an even BIGGER mistake. ... This can only go further downhill from here... and it will remain hilarious. xD
Im in PAIN everytime you lose your stuff, even though I'm not the only playing.
"you can't say no to a kitty" "Doesn't that have curse of binding on it?" "...No... WAIT SHI...."
call the ally the grally
( HC 6 Vibes ) (also it is 30th of August Victory Day on turkey support from turkey)
Griagon Alley
Oh loosing everything AGAIN, oh dear
Call the ally way, the ally express.
The new purple building is definitely my favorite addition to the alleyway so far
GRIANGOTS FOR THE BANK
Hmmm if he calls it an alleyway then maybe he should call it the Boatem Alley, and have all the shops named with different boats around the world.
8:30 call it gally
If you still don't know what to call your Alley I thought of Conjuring Caverns but it feels underwhelming to me I also saw people saying you should call it Horizont - Alley (like Diagon Alley)
you guys should use that fancy new glass and cover that hole to the void before more sacrifices are made
Name idea for "the alley".  If the train is the G-Train,  then the alley can be:  The GrAlley!
Name the alley dragon alley
scar should build a *very* small base ad Grian's and a mega one elsewhere
Grian: "doesnt that have curse of binding on it?" Scar: "no no... damnit"
6.9 million subs... Nice
oof i feel bad for you having to make so many sets of stuff. i know what its like cause i made like 5 max sets of netherite on one server
18:10 that oh no... is gorgeous
I'm soo excited whats the gega base gonna look like
You could call it orthogon alley. It keeps the theme and besides, your alley is more orthoganol than diagonal :)
Shag XD
You should name the alley vertic-alley so it's like diagon alley
The wonkie alleyway! Like if you like it
For a alleyway name I was thinking Grians Buried Alleyway, What do you think?
Fun name for the alley: Grians Alley. Or the Boatem Alley
instead of diagon alley you could call it sloped street or vertical passage or something that hints to diagon alley but then again not really
"The unnamed alleyway" sounds like a good name already to be honest lol
Grian, please tell us: *how do you keep managing to lose everything*
Personally I think it would be funny to name the alley after a shape like 'Hexagon Alley' as a play on words
Name suggestion for the alleyway.  Dia-grian alley
call the alley Griagon alley
Grian S6: Beacons suck Also Grian: unbelievebally, he stole my beacons!!

Grian... next episode can you do some I don’t know something about the front of your mountain
Grian you should name the Alley ‘Diamondgon Alley’
Name the mega base “Dia-GRIAN Ally”
I absolutely adore how wholesome you all deal with pranks/  item loss and the very tedious work behind it all when mishaps happen. Really makes Hermitcraft one of the most bright and friendly places on the internet. Love it guys !!!
9:04 by the way Jono makes soo good music for the time lapse
GRIAN GRIAN I HAVE A NAME FOR THE ALLEY Its not AMAZING but it could be used 🤷🏼‍♂️  The name is the *'Subterrane-Alley'* Idk if it is great but its an idea!!
Name idea for alleyway: vertic alley, like diagon alley; vertically and diagonally
That video had a lot of WONK
To connect all the mega bases together impulse should be mining out the mumbos mountain like a quarry.
How about you name the alley way, the Gr-alley way, hehe get it? cuze your name...is....gr..gria..n... I'm so bad at this
*S H A G*
Grain you should call your base cavern alley Also appreciate the work
8:47 oLiVaNdEr’S?!?!?! YoU mEaN oLiVaNdEr’S wAnDs?!
Wow the lag on the server lol
Should call it the Abstract Alley
U have 6.9 million subs
Karma… is a beach 🏖
Build a platform in the void so you don’t loos your stuff I don’t no if you can do that
You should call "The Alley", "Dripstone Drive"
when mumbo stole grians beacon I was crying from laughing when he said "hmm must've lagged out" 🤣🤣🤣
Call your helmet help me
The name of the ally should be Griagon Ally
Brian has 6.9 mill *nice*
Here's a name for the alley griagon alley
You should make a part of boatem inc. a barge
18:20 OH BOY WE LOVE TO SEE MORE AHAHA
Hear me out here... "DiaGRIAN Alley"
Tested Positive for covid guess it's time to catch up on all the hermits and their videos ❤
U should build a small version of the build battle house from season 6, i think it would fit in with the alley
Call the alleyway griagon alley!
Heres a name for the alley: Mountagon alley
My son is watching this episode with me and starts singing “Scar Wars done done done da….” I got to say my favorite part is when Grian and scar fall into the Boatem hole. My favorite hermits!
great builds as always ! i think the pink one is perfect, i really like it when you use unusual colours as the base pallet. I think that's what makes this alleyway unique ! as a bit of constructive criticism though, maybe consider making them MORE wonky. the first buildings have a great amount of wonk i think. more diagonals and more weird shapes are the vibe of this alley for me (since that's what reminds me of diagon alley)
Name suggestion for your ally way  "Driagon Abbey"
Scar is kind of an idiot. Nice guy, great builder, but not the brightest bulb by any stretch
Two words...  Build. Good.
Diagrian alley
DiaGrian Alley
well the title is ironic in a personal sense to me
Oh grian...
Text him on discord 😃👌
Surely this alley has to be called Horizont Alley.
8:20 maybe call it diagon alley?
6,9 mil subs B)
I'm not sure about f this will work but just here me out what if u sell 64 diamonds for 1 or 2 netherrite the sell a netherrite for some diamond blocks then repeat will it loop or will anybody even buy just a thought
Make an emporium at the back!
Happy Janmashtami ❤️❤️ If u don't know what It is just google ❤️
I love hermitcraft! Especially from ur pov!! Congrats on almost 7 mil
Call the alley the alleygrain!  Edit: blow this up so grian sees
Who else can't wait for 3rd Life Season 2?
every one !!!!!! stop subing to grian he is on 6.9 million subs
Oi oi oi G that's is stealing because he can give a beacon back but can you give him ores back
My audio broke when scare got out and there was just inaudible screeching
Grainally?
“It’s not about the over-engineering, it’s about sending a message.”  ーHeath Ledger as Grian *:* Ep 13
Build griangotts
Hmmm DiaGrian Ally ?? 👀
You should add building that look like your old bases
on our realm, my base is a 120 by 80 hole to bedrock and I got so much deepslate but it was so tedious
I think it would be cool if one of the buildings arched over the walkway and continued on the other side
10:44 umm that's sus
It's episode 13, so it was predictable that something bad happened.
Grian I think you should ask Mumbo for a vertical redstone door, that can close the hole and open it. For safety
alternate title: loosing everything 2 (electric boogaloo)
true friendship is diving into the endless void after someone to try to save them......................someone make that a tee-shirt
Since all of the buildings in the alley are supposed to be wonky, you could call it Diagonal Alley. (Diagon-al)
I mined 7 stacks of deepslate with an iron pic no haste
Grian seemed concerned about "curse of binding," and I thought "but it's Scar, he'll probably die in under 5 minutes!"😂
Why do I feel like Grian will build a big bank and call it Griangotts
How many times do I have to say this name it diagrian ally
I don't really like grian cause he always talks about time
NoBackally
HELLO
Grain really making diagon alley
Here before 5k comments:)
Dibby dibby diamonds dibby dibby diamonds more like dibby dibby netherite
You missed out on Wingy mabobs
After reading the title I got so scared when he kept jumping around the hole.
Will this be called grigon ally?
Eyyyyyy 6.9 mil
call it the gragonway it is g alleyway combined type thing think it sounds cool
15:07 did that bedrock just crack?
Grian your in the fin-aly
How about you call the alley DiaGrian Alley?
When grian has 6,9 million subs
Deep slate master of t... No! Deep slave master  of this server) Or... Dungeon master)
Grian is going mafia boss mode
"Sending Scar a message"  I don't like where this is going and.... "things" do happen here and there. Just gotta be careful with that hole ton more now.
Name for the alley : the magical alley
I know this sounds like there is no wffort put into it(cause there is not) but just “The alleyway” already sounds really freaking cool for a name
I love how Diagonal Alley is coming along
Each of the houses in the ally should have their own gimmicky names. Like a mob farm house should be called The Slanter House.
3rd life really changed scar
Mumbo: *steals Grian's emeralds and beacon* Grian: My beacon is missing Mumbo: *PrObAbLy LaG*
DO THE BACK!!!!! PLSSSSS
Boatem boulevard
You are the best YouTuber ever
So the alleyway has a name, finally! Finealley. Fine Alley. Get it? (×﹏×)
15:05 Is bedrock meant to behave like this?! Like I never saw any 2-pixel crack when I was punching it 0_o
Only six. Me what do you mean only six thats a lot
What you should bring to the boatem hole anytime you go there. 1. Elytra, not the one you regularly use. 2. A stack of rockets. 3. Whatever you are asked to bring. 4. Nothing else!
i have an idea for the alleys name, "the underway alleyway"
Pls Add the teg again!!!
The cavin ally? Perhaps?
Giagon alley
Make the end of your base Gringotts
How about you call it the Galleyway?
Grian building a giant dragon on top of the bank would be so cool
What if you make a limited stock trailer where you put in different items each time the last gets sold out
True test if he perused comments...Who votes Grian finds my amazing opportunity or misses out? 24hrs GRIAN 🎁
He should name it the gallyway
5 mega bases =  giga base 5 giga bases = tera base!!?
GRIAN      psst Name it gaiagon alley
When Scar gets the ender pearl to get out of the hole: **Happiness Noise**
Name it Horizon Alley (not Diagon Alley)
Lol scar won’t build the back because he’s building a cloud not a mountain
You could call the alley “Creeping Cavern” since the buildings are creeping over onto the street and cavern cause.. its a cavern.
Diagon alley pog
your videos always make me smile ;)
Damn pesky lag.
You should call the alley  alley road Completely original name yeah
the barrege eat your heart ou-EXCUSE ME! no..why. dont-don´t do that  P.S. dis is a joke
14:08 oh scar of the hole what is you're wizdom scar: everyone gets pushed down no matter what
Its A Galley or a gilley
Accidentally killing Scar as part of a prank seems to be a a theme with you
Jokes on all of them: Scar is dyslexic
Season 7 Barge and sells one piece of rotten flesh for two stacks of Diamonds. But if you close your eyes. Season 8 G train and several deaths in the void. Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
We should get haste 3 in 1.18 for the deepslate to be insta mine
Should have said tri dent in my wallet
WAIT DID THAT BEDROCK START BREAKING 15:07
Let's do some quick maffs. 2 hours = 2 stacks of diamonds + misc 5 hours = 2 perished parcels which is worth like 50 diamonds each, let's be generous and say it's 100 diamonds each 13 hours = 5 parcel Scar ordered for 100 diamonds off (400) In 13 hours, he could mine 13 stacks of diamonds  Scar is the real winner here.
Anyone else wanting Grian to build the dragon from Gringotts' vaults?
I have an idea to connect impulses base and mumbo’s base. So basically a big pipe with more pipes connecting to impulse factory, And impulse should build like a nuclear plant with pipes, speaking of the pipes! Make like an connectivity system that goes FAST to impulses base.
You should call the alleyway "G" *alle* ry
What's the timelapse music
Names for the alley: G-way G-alley Gralley
The alley way name : wonky snakey alley or wsa
Now grian needs to make a K.M.J.O.O.M.R
Waiting for GRIAN to find me 😁💯🎁
You should make a bank at the end of the alley and call it griangotts like gringotts in diagon alley
name for the allyway "live longe corridor"
You could make each of your bases as different "biomes".
Is it diagon alley he is building?
15:07 HOW DID THE BEDROCK CRACK????
A little bit of wonk
Alley way name suggestions:  Shipment Ally Boatem Streetem Grain Street
You should call the alley "Vertic" ally or "Horizon" alley, i the same vein of play on words that "Diagon" ally is a play on "diagonally", referencing a direction.
I watch hermit craft so much that enchanted diamond tools look more normal than non enchanted tools
I’m serious,put a platform under that hole or plug it up!!!!!
Found me yet? 🤔
Why people dislike? smh
You should name the alley "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street" or "Mulberry Street" from the Dr.Suess book
"doesn't that have curse of binding on it" has me in tears laughing, oh my god
I want to promote you to EVERY childcare and school in AUSTRALIA 🎁
4:50 is it slow???  I mined about 5 or more stacks with stone pickaxe
Pension for grain to call the alley way the gralleyway
sussy moss armchair
Wonkally.
God i get so happy when grian posts
It's amazing how days of work can be condensed into less than half an hour.
58 min and already 3.9k comments
Wait a second didnt grian have like 6 stacks of a geen block right before he di-WAS SACRIFICED to the boatem hole
Man, Grian, you need to spend less time Wonking in minecraft
hey Grian I was thinking instead of "Diagon Alley" name it "Grianagon Alley" ( Griagon, Griangon) I dont know it is your base after all but just a thought
Grian is like an evil genie. "Yeees, your wish shall be granted. One ender pearl you say? You're welcome... into the arms of DEATH!"
DIAGRIAN ALLEY
Ah yes Cooper Dam the place where the 2 battle between the NHR and Grians legion took place (dont know If i mispelled somthing)
Who is an amazing YouTube's that would be perfect role model for kids 🎁
The end of the alley should be a graveyard and a mausoleum.
Grian u should call it the grialogue alley
Grain never killed him Scar jump in him self lmao
The deep alley is my idea for a name I like your builds 2
if you read your comments like this.. pls
Hi
Can u make two houses for two neighbors that hate eatch other? Ya know, make there houses look the same, like there copying eachother?
Find me GRIAN 🎁
I have an idea hear me out  (I’m sorry fore the spelling errors English Isn’t my first language)  Impulse base is an factory he’s taking resources from the Mountain. This has angers the Mountain/mountai god what ever it is. So the mountain intern is sending out tree monsters from Mumbos base (because peace love and plants).  And this is happening over time where impuls destroys more and more of the mountain and the mountain sends out more and more tree monsters.  Maybe cood be cool
Why is this pinned
Alley name: Valley Allley, fun to say and great to stay
ProjectANDOoz
if your gonna build a bank you should name in griangots
Mr.Grian, you could call it "The Gally"
Fun Fact: The alley should be called "Dia-Grian Alley"
damn that's sad lol
Click copper blocks with water bottles age them faster
This comments All lag
random question: do you still play sea of thieves?   i dont expect an awnser..
You should call the alley "The Galley" or "The Grally"
Grain; and 2 hours of mine *ONLY* made 6 *SHOLKER BOXES* of deepslate
I really get happy when grian posts
I don’t understand why diamonds are so valuable because when  they lose their diamond armour, they trade for a new set rather than just make on
If you space the copper by 4 blocks and group up the same type of oxidized copper it will oxidized faster
Day idk of telling him to call it Griagon Alley
that chaos in the void
Losing everything again?
The boatem hole and boatem pole has been the rise and fall of boatem.    (Pun not Intended)
(Not related) granite is doo doo ca ca  Change my mind
Grian
too bad the alley isn't diagonal because you could call it diagonal alley.
Instead of Grian calling it Diagon Alley... He should call it DiaGRIAN Alley
6,9 mil    Nice
So noyone gonna talk about how grian used the fancy a? 🤔
amazing as always
You should name the alleyway diagrian alley
Loving grains content (again)
Normally I’m not here before 1 hour but eyyy
s
maybe you could call it Cavestone Ally
Grian, do you mind building a wonky building woth dirt???
I HAVE A NAME FOR THE ALLEY: the Galley :))
I'm here since 6.9M subs
16:46 This is the definition of karma.
Grains making diagon alley
Call it the Back Alley, because nothing in there has a back.
13:20 „insert Lion King joke here“
Base name suggestion: The Grianon Alley
I'm calling the brown building the barge co
Last season a boat/raft, this season a train as a shop? Whats next a plane? A submarine??
it happens at 16:22
After tatman we now need a second superhero......grian you know what i mean....the chickens have to be back with.....po...poul..... Poultry man!!!
I miss your old timelapse songs, good episode, lots of timelapses and more variety of progress. Keep up the work G
Griagon Alley?
9:50 the ally of wonk?
I'd even make my price 3 diamonds per stack. And I'm sure it'll be swept off the shelves
Your video does come very fast 😒😒 5 days .................................................
that final elytra jump thing was amazing, literally miliblocks away from hitting the floor
I wonder if hell do the map thing again?
It's fitting that the chairman of Boatem Inc lives in a massive armchair
You should put your inspiration picture up during the timelapse of you building it.
Why isn't the G Train called "The Alley Express"
This alley make me think a bit of Sarlat la Canéda's alley ( in Dordone France ) -_° ?
He should say holed on
noted. trains fly as well as cars.
You should name the "alleyway", "AlCove" because the alleyway looks like shipwrecks cove in a cave.
episode 13, the unluckiest episode hmmm
This is not actually my idea, i dont remembre who suggested this but you should call the bank Griangotts
6.9 million subs. Nice
ah yes, the perfect way to unwind after a hard first day of high school
at the end of the alleyway instead of gringotts bank you should have griangotts bank.
Boatem hole needs blood.
Gotta add that wonk
I guess the void always has the last laugh
"oi! scar mate, buddy, pal!! place your swag here!!"
Maybe it called The Diamond alleyway and also sprinkle a little diamonds here and there
Grian: so Scar would start building a mountain  Scar: flying base
Call the ally boatem street
Grian: I just broke my neck. Me: *Minecraft character is don't have a neck...*
At least it’s an alleyway and not an enemyway.
Pesky Bird.
Very entertaining
hi grain, im going to put grain into my silo
The boatagon alley ?
I have been binge watching season 7 now I have to get used to waiting for these episodes haha. I love these videos! I wish I had this talent.
🤣 That interaction with Scar...that's why you guys are my two favorite Hermits.🤣❤
You should call the alley Dia mond alley
I love how your decision to mine deep slate IMMEDIATELY rewards you with diamonds lol.
If you want the wall to oxidize faster try putting an already oxidized block in it
Conclusion... GRIAN IS AN ANT
I mean Scar WAS supposed to build the back of the mansion (which never happened to my knowledge) so building the back of Grian's base was just pushed back a season
Name for the ally way: green road or gray road
you  should name the alley G Street or Wonky  Way
Everyone’s minds : deep slate = amazing  Grians mind : deep slate = torture
19:57 should have been Tri-dent in the wallet
WONK
Name it Horizon Alley. Since it's based on Diagon Alley
PLS GRIAN MAKE SCAR BUILD BY IMPULSES BASE HE MADE THE BOATEM HOLE HE DESERVSES IT PLS :)
He wants to build a sky cloud kind of thing right
I think you could name the alleyway "The Backless Alley".
10:43 wait what...
Does anyone have a counter for how many times scar has lost everything to the boatem hole? If not we need to start one
You should make a playlist called "scarnanigans" and it's with every video with scar
DiaGrian Alley....just throwing it out there.
6.9k LESS GOOOOO
You should call your alley way gigganol-alley
the alleyway should be named (the grallyway cuz it's like grian........but a alley.) eny thoughts?
Scar wats to make a city in the clouds not a mountain
congrats on the good mcc placement
You could name the alley the G alley aka the Galley
So. I'm currently playing a survival game on bedrock edition (don't @ me. My computer sucks), and I have had the literal worst luck, so I'm using mostly stone tools. No beacon, unenchanted, stone pickaxe. Mining deepslate.
I Just Finished Watching all of The series so far a few hours ago... Weird
Why not call the Alleyway the " Season- Fin-Alley".  Straight with the puns and whoe else can say they built the season-finalley  before schedule?
Grian: The Barge; Eat your heart out (8:08) Barge and Barge Fans: *Now  P E R I S H .  .  .*
BEACONS CAN BE HOLLOW EVEN WITHOUT A BOTTOM! USEFUL USE IT NOBODY KNOWS EXEPT ME AND IT MAKES ME CRAZY
Ah yes,"build you S H A G here"
I think the alley is a brilliant way to eventually use every block in the game.
14:36 that dangit hits different Edit: 18:10 this one also
Wonk
Grian should have placed an end crystal in front of scar
I think "Grain Street" has a nice ring to it
Doesnt scar still owe you the back of a base from the turf war
If the bank is not called Griangots, theres a missed opportunity
Ive got an idea for the mame of the alley. It should be called diagonal alley.
Tbh it's not that bad scar died since he put on a curse of binding head but it be better if it wasn't in the void
Possibel name for the alleyway: Hermitgon Alley
Wouldnt be suprised if scar built a massive 'here' ontop 9f the mountain
Scar: Puts on Cat Head Grian:"Doesn't that have Curse of binding on it?" Scar:"No. . . Dammit"
Do it anyway for the diby diby diamonds
Name it Griagon Alley plz
The bank thing? Surely it'll be Griangotts, and started entirely by Grianbots
Since most of the boatem members are building mountain bases, you should build another mountain nearby with the faces of all the boatem villagers : Mount Boatem-more
Grian you should get Netherite gear sometime soon. It's going to be better for harvesting deepslate.
Call it the valley way or west p minster valey
GRINGOTTS BANK Gringotts Bank gringotts bank griAngotts bank GriAngotts Bank GRIANGOTTS BANK Griangotts Bank in Diagonal-Lane
season 8 barge noob train god season 9 .... car ultra mego godd season 10 space OMG THIS BEST OTHER NOOB LIKE TRAIN BARGE i mean it looks its gonna happen
Your next season DYDB, is the "Mayhaps your Mortal Materials"
Names for your base is Mountgon Alley or Griangon Alley
Are you ever going live again?
Alley idea,:alley of under:or gralley
Typical grian... I don't want to do my job,  so I'll convince someone else to do it.
Gregonely
Season 7:"Wow everyones bases are so close together" Season 8:
Good thing he has deepslate because in 1.18(assuming the season will last till then) will have deepslate everywhere beneath y0 so everyonr would do it easily and not buy deepslate. Still slow, but at least it will be everywhere instead of every once in a while
Hermitgon alley I’m not good with names(:
6:25 an people say chorus fruit is useless, there is a reason people dupe them on anarchy servers
“Sending scar a message,”  Everyone from season 7: WARWARWAR
Maby name the ally way the hole way
Aw shi- here we go again
Call the alley the …………….. Galley short for Grian’s alleyway.
6.9 million. Nice
You wanted someone to build the back of the build again, eh?
Hes at 6.9 million subs....n🧊
Grian should call the ally diagrion allllllley
Just added a bit of wonk Grian - 2021
i have an idea (or two) for the name of your Alley! since Diagon Alley is a play on "diagonally", i thought maybe Vertik Alley? from "vertically", obviously. maybe something along those lines? alternatively something like Horizont Alley, but i definitely prefer the first one. whaddy'all think?  ps. i'm looking forward to the (potential) "Grian Wonk" remixes lol
Call it the valley way
Am i the only one who thinks that Grian's alley base feels like diagon alley?
Grian you should call your build cragalley as a pun on craggily and alleyway.
The fact that grian jumped into the void to save scar gave me flashbacks of the GRIAN-SCAR TURF WAR DUO
Grian deepslate should be 3 Diamonds/stack or 1 Diamond block/4 stacks (buy 3 get 1 free).
mabye the galley way ????? pun sort of
GRIANGOTTS
Wow! If I had a nickel for every time Grian died to the Boatem Hole, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. Right?
This is now my favorite episode for all of hermit craft! So much fun!
G-Avenue ??
Name the alley Grain alley yes I wanted to say GRAIN
Griagon alley?
This boatem pole was a catastrophic genius idea...
I suggest you call the Alley way: "The G-alley Way". Just place infront of any word and it's great name already.
You deserved that grian
Namw idea for the alley Gria-gon alley don't know if you'll see this but whatever ' '<
Scar should build a blimp
He sacrificed himself for another hermit a true hero like the legend of poultry man too bad we dont know who the man in the chicken costume is
I know you didn't ask for it but idea for alley way name could be (spell this how you like) Griagon Alley.
Name idea For reference: Knockturn Alley=Nocturnally Diagon Alley=Diagonally  Quadrang Alley=Quadrangle-y (because squares)
0:15  Grian: Scar like to over think Le me: Same
Brian mombo jumbo steals your becon
Karma
i really dont like the terraining for mumbo and grian's base, it doesn't look very good
You Should Call the Alleyway griagon alley
Its so unfortunate when my friends entire chest of diamonds just lags into my base.
DIAGRIAN ALLEY
I think scar is making a cloud with something on it sooooo you may have to make the terrain
the Galleyway
"i added a bit of  *W O N K* "  -grian 2021
I think it will be better to have the heights of building a bit different.
I'm just saying boatagon alley
Name the alley boatem alley
Break this video meik my so happi
At this point, I'm shocked Mumbo or Impulse hasn't put some redstone in the hole to count the number of sacrifices to the Boatem deity.
Yes karma
Are your two brain cells called scar and mumbo
Grian: doesnt complete something before the copper oxidises The Server: Thanos Snaps twice, wiping out EVERYTHING and EVERYONE
somebody look at how many subs Grian has  6.9
Greogon ally
Why don't you call you alley the galley
Well well Grian... Perhaps Did You Perish 😂
You should totally make Gringotts-esque build at the end of the alleyway! that would be so cool!    Edit: spelling
You sacrificed yourself Grian    Very honorable
I think that Griadon Alley wouldn't be a bad name for the alley :D
Now yk how it feels to make an entire mountain of deepslate😢😂
Grian: I did a *small* amount of deep slate mining Also Grian: *makes an artificial cave*
Griangotts Bank in DIAGON ALLEY Diagon Alley diagon ally diagonal-lane diagonAL-LANE DiagonAL-LANE DIAGONAL-LANE GRIANGOTTS BANK IN DIAGONAL-LANE Griangotts Bak in Diagonal-Lane?
You should have charged him a full stack of diamond blocks. Thats 576 diamonds.
You should call it the Wonk Way
Boatalley
a name idea for the ally: Horizont-Ally!
just finished bingeing the whole of season 7, this coming out now is such perfect timing
2 diamond per half a stack deepslate!
Dia-Mond Alley
I wonder if whenever the other Hermits see "X fell into the void"   they're like, "Ahh, classic Boatem Crew at it again..."
F's in the chat for the wooden shovel that grain lost when he fell into the void. F.
Copper clock guy
The bank should be called Griangotts
7M!!!!!
My jaw and cheeks hurt from laughing and smiling so much 😭
You Should Design One Of The Buildings To Be Barge HQ
8:43 [] {} []
Call the alley "Wonkyway"
Now we understand why hermints usually does not have netherite stuff.
You can call the alley for “gally”
I think it would be cool if grian put a storage system at the end of the alley kinda like the bank
you should call it tunes alley
Grain you should put your face in your mountain like Mount Rushmore!
haha quarry go brrrrr
Griagon Alley looks awesome!
“Gria-gon alley”
Me reading the title "oh God not again"
please make the engine pulling it a black 5 grian
The clip of scar at the end is so golden
5:31 When you were mining deepslate were you aware of the 2 amaththyst geodes your spectator account saw?
I called it!  The gigabase is just a ploy to have Scar build your mountain!  lmao This is hilarious.
I know that it isn't really original, but what if you call the alleyway "The Gralleyway" (Ya know, Grian and alleyway combined.)
Omashu Alley
seeing you both fall in felt like something just grabbed my literal heart and squeezed. That was so painful to watch.
He has 6,9 mil followers!!
Tip for more money: Rent out the buildings in the alley for extra diamonds, that will save more time thank mining deep slate
I laged into the comments
OI! SCAR, MATE, BUDDY, PAL!! PLACE YOUR SHAG HERE!!
HI
Grain spread the copper out more then it oxidised faster
Hermitecraft 7- gets scar to be somewhat responsible of  the back of the mansion. Hermitecraft 8- trying to get scar to be responsible of the back of the terrain. now that's me!
You should name your base Sally the ally, located in a valley
Grian remember in one episode of building your comments long ago someone told you to build play buttons , when you were building the diamond playbutton you said"i will obviously never reach that milestone" and here we are , very close , 3.1 million to go
name suggestion for the allyway...    "THE GRALLYWAY"!  quite cool isnt it?
Seeing Scar and Grian interact hasn't been this entertaining since Third Life...
Chaotic alley
You should rename the shovel the Ace of Spades
call the alley diagonal alley
GrianGotts bank
If there was an item collector at the bottom of the boatem, it would be the best loot of the server
I love how Grian knows Scar so well. Thanks for the upload, G.  Also, this COULD be a ploy to continue the tradition of having Scar complete the back og Grian's megabases.
Griagon alley
how about "Driagon Egg Ally"
19:40  Mumbo is making american accents  And not grian makes aussie accents
Name for the ally Lets call it The Gally way
Grian alley
How hermits tell the time  Bdubs: makes too many clocks Grian: makes a walk of copper
I know i good name for the alleyway "Alley of Valley" or "wonk alley"
This happend to me as well I died with full prot 4 netherite armour and then went to go get it and it despawned and a week later I lost another set of stuff in the void
He should call the bank building “Grain-gotts”
That hole was a mistake. I wonder how many lives will it claim from the botem crew.
If you make a bank call it griangotts
Hi Grian, do you know the crooked house of winsor? That would be a good inspiration for a building with a lot of wonk.
G train alley
first hour ticket here
Should call it Gria-gon Alley  (Pun much intended)
im exited to play this
gamer
name suggestion: miocon ally
Rip top-hat You will be missed
Make the road to your base out of granet and name your base the grian-net hall.
Terrible idea: Remake the alley diagonally and call it diagonal alley
You should make all of your buildings in the alley shops so it would be like an actually diagon alley
Que the music and lets gooooo
36,10 th message
Diagrian alley
The sequel nobody needed
Grian: if I don’t do something before the copper oxidises then it will be doomsday Civil war and turf war: doomsday you say? Every hermit: pack your bags we’re going to season 9 early Grian: I’m all packed and ready to go Every hermit:
Grian, dude, loved the new houses but chimneys inside of a cave :/ dunno feels a bit ť̴̙͝h̸̹̝̓̊ì̸̠͉c̴͙̽k̵̖͇̚
You shoulda named it “tri dent in my bank account”
Since its boatem village and the alley if owned by grian how about calling it the Galley it's both a pun for a ship and grian's name and alley. Keep it simple right!
make the Big Ben form London at the last of your base and make some buildings surrounding it
Grian at this point u should start an insurance service, ppl will pay u like 30 diamonds every 100 minecraft days and if they lose their stuff in those 100 days u can give them a whole new set of stuff
You should call the alley way (the bread way)
How hermits tell the time  Bdubs: makes too many clocks Grian: makes a walk of copper
Would Diagonal Alley work? Lolol
I vote we just call the alley, the "Gralley" sweet simple and very on brand.
Name for the allyway: The Waysaway
Grian Should make the sign out of Copper and ask scar to wax it.
How about naming it "Diagrian Alley"
I think the bank should be called grianlots
Grian: I think he is making a mountain Scar: *Is in fact making a floating island*
Name it angled alleyway
really
diamond alley
How about the Galleyway.
Me trying to think of a way to mix alley and Grian: Galley
Wonky Alley
Cave Alley
Best thing on Youtube HERMITCRAFT
Fun fact: nobody has watched this video twice
Lag
Please name it the Gralleyway
Grian:- you want me Boat &hole :- I want you baby 😂
"Wonk Street" is a good name for the alleyway lol
The Twisted Alley, Ribbon Alley, Barge(may not be spelled right, but a reference to season 7) Alley are some names I thought of grian =)
How about naming it the G alley but just for the kicks, pronounce it the galley
You should call it boatem alley.
You should make the big bank at the end of your ally called gringots but it’s called Grian gots :D
I think you should name the alleyway  Mousehole, an English village that's far bigger than its name suggests. or Mine, a Japanese town that has everything apart from mining activities. or ( I think you will like this one the most) Wonk, a word Grian used
Put railways around the deepslate to make it look like its all tied up
I’ve been waiting for this vid
I'm just leaving this here.... "Griagon Alley"
I think for the big building at the back should be a bank to display some of your diamond blocks!
Grian you should call your base diagonally
hello welcome to the series where i break a hole into the floor and we all jump into it 500 times
3557
Name it the gally
AGAIN?

The Boatem shopping district !! Spéciality ?? Dying and having to rebuy their stuff on there own shop °-°   Love the new wonky twin builds and thank you for the laughs :D
You should put green on your montain it looks out of place
Is this village supposed to be around boats or mountains?
You should call it "Horizon Alley" as a play on Horizontally since Diagon Alley is a play on Diagonally
NEVER DISRESPECT THE BARGE AGAIN 😠😂
"The Unnamed Alley" sounds good to me.
Grian name the alleyway griagon alley
grian dies because of scar and himself part 2
“I have to activate my 2 brain cells to remember how to spell things”  School starts tomorrow and this is EXACTLY How I feel 💀💀
Could call it horizont alley
So uh.... Lag war now?
What about Diagrain alley???
Grian you can call your alley griagon alley
You should call the alley stonk alley
“OI!! SCAR, MATE, BUDDY, PAL!! PLACE YOUR SHAG HERE!!”  i got a good laugh out of that spelling error
RIP
The Boatem Hole doesn't just demand sacrifices...  it FORCES them lol
f
The boatom biway??
i have a name for the alley praposterous propertys
grian is all about sending a message
Am I the only one who thinks that Grian should put glow squids in the glass boxes at the front of the alley? They’ll match with the warped wood
Scar is going to over think and not build at all
Grianyway, also Grian congrats on 6,9mil >:)
The alleyway looks even better at night
call the alley diamond alley but say it like your saying diagon alley
Idea for a name for the alleyway. 'Mystic street'.
Why not name it "Griangotts" since it's heavily HP inspired lol
When you friends starter base is bigger than you mega base
Welp, what if he *Literally* builds where your sign is? =Professional Overthinker
You should call the alleyway the grallyway bc grian =gr and alleyway =allyway
Grian why dont u just make a train entrance at the other side of the alleyway
Next episode :- losing everything (again and again)
How about "GRALLEY"?????  A name for your alleyway
What about hermion alley

Ang pogi ko!!

WONK!
Miacon Ally! It’s a corny Minecraft allyway name!
👍👍👍👌👌👌👏👏
Hey grian You Should Make the buildings in your base for sale since you wanted for the boatem village to be the shopping district.
Nice
Yea what if i say that the video i was watching lagged and this video was replaced in the meanwhile
I think you should name alleyway gralyway
Since mumbo is “tat” man, grian should become the poultry supervillain “the Yolker”
Yay finally a new hermitcraft episode came!!
When you add your version of Gringotts you should call it Grian-gotts
can't believe i'm measuring my time in the hospital with covid pneumonia by grian uploads
Pearl: building a mountain Scar: building a mountain  Grian: building a mountain  Mumbo: building a mountain   Impulse: building a massive factory that causes massive amounts of pollution
Alan the ally???
Grian should build a clock tower at the end of the alley and this episode is just all about scar
Having floating candles at the roof of the alley would be amazing
Name idea: Asymmetric Alley
FiRSt
You've seen the back of the mansion drama. Now get ready for the back of the terrain drama!!!!
diagrian alley
Blackstone alley
Grian is the only person I know to call 10,368 of anything, (I did the math, that's how much cobbled deepslate is in 6 shulker boxes) a small amount
He should call the alley "Horizon Alley"   hor (like horse) ee (like deed) zon (like Ron with a z) and alley like normal.   That way it's a pun because it's a horizontal alley and like diagon alley :)
Current boatem kill count:  22 current biggest killer: eggsplosion
Alley name proposal: Nautic Alley
Griagonalley?
the title i was just wating
Huh de ja vu
you should call the alley "thealley" except you gotta say it really fast so it's all one word
Very rich man
Scar: ..I had a trident on me Grian, realising: ..ᵒʰ ⁿᵒ
Grian, call it the Ration Alley. It's a play off of the word rationally (like Diagon Alley) and I'd say you're supplying rations for *rationally* good prices.
Grian should show some inspiration pics before hand, so we can imagine what its gonna look like while he builds
Did no one else realize that scar was breaking the bedrock a little??
Call it the GALLEY. The galley is where you eat on a boat and it just happens to start w a G and ends with Alley
grianfordreamslayer
The Gally
Gotta hate that lag
Oh well
18:17 what's that sound please does somebody know about that or it's a sound effect
6.9mil POG and *nice*
Name for the alley- Griagon alley?
Love the end credit scene
The alley way should be named the galley way
You should put the grain in the town, as a magical train station with magical tracks. Then you dont need as many anvils
We need a death count for the boatem hole
18:11 he sounds like flamingo lmaooooo
Hermitcraft season 8 is all about Scar and Grian bullying each other 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is so fun! My favourite duo ❤️
That was super funny
Maybe you could call the alley "Rockway Alley" since its a lot of stone in there.
Grian: "we are going to send scar a message  Me: NOT AGAIN
Wonk alley??
Cliffside Corridor... Asymmetric Ally... Diagonal Drive...
19:20. Nice music 👌
Scar be like: what are u doing stepgrian?  Oh nothin but would u like to build ur base near mine?
ITS A STATIONARY HOLE IN THE GROUND HOW DOES IT KEEP KILLING YOU IT DOESNT MOVE ANYWHERE
HERMITCRAFT APOCALYPSE
The grally, grian’s alley
hermitcraft for life
He should call the dilly deli alley- look it up
Grian why don't you call it botem way
I have a name you could use for the alley way. G alley way or gs magic alley way.
Diagon alley is fine but what about hotizont alley
Grain watch mumbo's videos please so you can understand what he is doing
Anyone else think they should cover up the boatem hole? 💀
hermitcraft seems to lag so much ?
6.9 million: nice
Everything you say……even you’re mind
I'm thing build a dragon head somewhere and call it dragon ally
It's not grains fault that they died it was lag
Grian you could name your alley "Wonk Alley"
Might I suggest the names Vertic Alley and Horizont Alley.
CALL THE ALLEY GRIANAGON ALLEY!!!!!!!! PLEASE
I was watching bdubs stream yesterday and I was wondering what all the dying was about HAHAHA
Mumbo mumbo afk I’m gonna take grian’s beacon today
Wat if scar biulds in all those places
G you should name the alley Giga Avenue
New trident name -TrI've been impaled-
every time grian says diamonds i think of dibby dibby diamonds
You should name it DiaGrianon ally because grian always has so many diamonds and he lost them all this episode
19:10 this is why grian is so rich
“Griagon alley”
Man the most comedic episode ever
Lol episode 13 the unlucky number he loses everything
Grian why dong you turn your base into a shop (or multiple) like diagonally ally ?
.
Grain + Daigon Alley = Griagon Alley
Daigrian Alley
the allywonk
It's Gringots bank Grian
You should call the alley The Galley (Grian's alley)
Call it “emerald ally”
The diddle dallyway
Be cool if scar made a giant copper tower that supplied “power” to the rest of the giga base
scar walked off the cobblestone actually.
Message...
alley name idea: diamondgon alley
Oh laggg
Hermits Hamlet for the mega base maybe
I think the alleyway should be called   Dyamond-alley, like diagon alley.
Scar: I don' t have any rockets Grian: So I made him fall in the void anyway
??
First big war: Hermits vs. Boatem Hole
1 hour gang
Scar and Grian's dynamic is so amazing 😭
Do you have any recommendations for building a xp farm in Xbox 360 and it is stuck in 1.3 because we don’t have WiFi to update it
Diagon alley is a pun of diagonally so why not call it Horizon alley for horizontally
Inside next season are you just gonna make an airplane
Grian created Star Wars   Light saber sound effect = Wonk wonk
At the end make hotel it well be nice
Griagon Alley for the alley name?
The bank in the end of diagon alley is called gringots. You should call it griangots
What about Anom Alley? Anomaly? Get it?
Grianagon alley
Call the ally way ( the gally way)
I'm early first 4k comments
Consider that Scar builds over all 3 of the mountains - that would be the best for boatem!
So what are we going to- *APART FROM BREAKING MY NECK-*
Make a vault called griangots
Its even worse if your not trying to get the deepslate and you have to mine through it
It's not a Grian episode if he doesn't fall into the Boatem hole
The Gally
Laggin g cave maybe  Pls use it would be funny
I'd reckon the people on the server who aren't living in close proximity to a hole in the fabric of reality probably don't need to replace their items as frequently. Strange how that happens.
the boatem hole is as much of a curse as it is a blessing
lol grian with a wonderful Montresor impression on scar there.
the boatum hole: "I have gotten my weekly sacrifice I am appeased!"
name the aly way grally
Losing everything p2
Boatem Alley sounds nice
Botemalley
Grian I am a big fan I have watched almost every single video you have made and your videos are the best you are the best youtuber ever I’m so happy that I can watch your videos thank you 😊
blame it on the lag lol
6.9 mill subs
*bruh*
Might want to ask mumbo to invesigate the possiblity of using boring machine to mine deepslate
This is my favourite episode from this season. Point.
Call it the wonk alleyway
Your god bulider of minecraft  i love yo grian
This hermitcraft season should be called Hermitcraft-MoutainCraft
At 21:05 there’s a new text in the background
You need to name it the grian ally, gally.
Is it me or does grain like the word "Wonk"
Call the alley way the galley way
"Add a wonk" - Grian
Not again
please call your alley the wonky-way
He should name the ally Wonk-way Ally!!!
I have a name idea for the Alley, "Elderrich Alley"
Hmm... how about: The V.Alley
Scars reaction to the curse of binding was so funny
Ally name, Griagon Ally.
Griagon ally
Hello i commented 40 minutes after upload lol
Da-Grianal Alley🤌
*you should build a walmart and name the alley "The Alley Behind Walmart"*
Name idea for the alley: Allison way because it's an alley and Alley is short for Allison this is a dumb joke
Name idea for the alley: Fine Alley. That way you Fine Alley have a name for it.
I think making that message made him overthink a bit more 😭
You should totally live stream the tedious stuff
if i've learned anything from seasons 6-8, it's that the smaller the construction of the business, the more financially successful (sahara vs the barge vs the possible potential of the G train)
I got a name for the alley! “Hermigon Alley”
Early yay
10:44 thats a very unfortunate looking W. I- I was very confused
I have to keep saying this each episode, because it's just that good. But I love Grian's timelapse music this season.
I have genuinely never seen people lose their stuff as much as the boatem crew does
GRIAN NOOOOOO GRIANNNNN
I’d say that’s the reason they don’t wear Netherite
Is it just me or does the deepslate compartment looks like a burnt down shop/compartment
Don't make ur new thing getting sacrificed to the boatem hole, also plz call it vertic-alley
2 hours of deepslate mining is 6 box’s full of deepslate or 1/4 of the deepslate used in scars starter base
You should do Demise part 2 in October
Claim your “Here Before an Hour Ticket”
Gally way
The g-train is like the hogwarts express and the alley is like diagon alley!!!
Ha ha subscriber count lol
Grain: look how slow this is It: almost Insta mine
You should call the alley Griagon alley!
The funniest episode I've watched in a while. Thank you Grain
idea. boatem town hall at the end of it
I’ve been mining deepslate with a stone pickaxe
He’s at 6.9 million.   Nice.
Grian you know how everyone misspelled your name to "Grain"..... yeah so why not call your alley "Baker's Alley" or something like that
Griagon alley Not original name
The Grialley way is what you should call your base
perfect name for the alley: Griagon alley
I'm fairly sure this is why Grian hasn't upgraded to netherite yet lol
“ the big bank or something “  Me: GRINGOTS!!!!!!
6.9M! 😂
ally name: DIAGRIAN ALLEY!!!!
I was watching Bdubs stream yesterday and saw the death messages of you and Scar falling in the void. Everyone in chat assumed it was another boatem meeting.
that was truly karma
honestly deepslate is a high demand item, you could probably charge more, its definitely more valuable than cobblestone
Okay, I know you just lost your stuff but how you have enchanted diamond equipment, shulker boxes, and elytra. Yet, you don't have any netherite equipment?
"I died again alley" lol
Make a hotel that looks like it's been carved in on and call it the cave-inn
Name the alley diagonal alley... I'm really proud of that one actually.
place your shag here .LMAO
Yo
I think Griagon Alley would be a funny name for the base
Grian, cmon, stop playing around with the void. It won’t *end* well
I think that Grally way is a good name for it
Griagon alley
Why not just call is Orthogon Alley? (orthogonal movement being opposite of diagonal)  Also, don't forget you got those diamonds while ALSO getting your deepslate, so it's not so bad.
All I will say is ooooof
cumin
What about "Vertic alley" as a name for the alleyway?
Best of Grian - 11:29 12:49 14:22 15:11 15:44 16:35 18:05 18:35 19:34 22:31
The boatem hole was definitely a bad idea
Every time grian falls in the boatem hole I have 2 Nickels which isn’t a lot buts wired that it happened twice
Grian you should a make a backup box for yourself.
U had built the g-trian to go inside pearls mountain but u didn't show it?
6,9 million subs, nice
Hello grian I have a idea for your build that you can consider so here it is. What if you made the town hall from season 7 and you could make your bank in their idk
Your catching up on scars death rate
Grian, name your alley Griagon alley. It’s perfect.
grian the building at the back of your base should be a storage room and it could be called griangotts
I bet the next shenanigans on the server will just be mumbo and grian repeatedly stealing from eachother and blaming the lag
I guess I dont have to do math anymore
Copper weathers the most when its spread apart from each other.
Scar wants to build a castle in the sky grian
I have a idea for the name for the ally it is " dilly dally ally "
What if we name the alley "thealiey" It's literally the alley but with an accent. I'm uncreative...
You should all the ally cobbled alley
E
Sees the thumbnail*  Sees the clip with Grian at the boatem hole*  Nervous sweating*
Me reading the title: Oh no Grian what did you do again
Just put glass in the hole
you should call your base the wonkyway or the wonkway. it's like wonk + allyway
Criesssssssssss
Lets take a moment to apreciate that grain has reached 6,9 mil subs, nice
Idea write Hollywood but with a reference on perals mountain like so grian can see
scar: stepgrian I'm stuck in a hole!!!
10:41 a very agressive "oi", but at least it's not Scar's "oh hi"
Gringotz should be at the end of the alleyway. There should be a dragon protecting the egg inside.
You can call you alleyway "THE GREENSBERG ALLEY" it seems like a good name according to me
Finaly I came out with a name the galy way
Woah, the lag spikes were crazy this episode
How about the grally I know it's bad but it's all I got lol
Ok hear me out. You’ve got a building that mimics olivanders. What if you had a building that mimics the Weasely Emporium with a Grian styled statue out front??
Scar is sooo cute Sometimes XD
Gold pickaxe efecincie v haste 2 can do it
Alley way just like grianyway
Destroying everything at light speed and saying it’s too slow is.. a very Hermitcraft thing to say.
grian btw armor villagers and weaponsmith villagers sell diamond enchanted gear
Call it the G-Way
Grian you mist the hat of scar
Make gringots and go down in the ground
"Orthogon Alley"
Idea for a name for the alley Vertic alley (based on vertically)
BIG FAN OF GRIAN OMGGGG!
19:07 grian spent 3.6 years getting those resources back for him and scar. he really does grind
Galley!!!
Is it just me or do the hermits all feel a lot more invested in this season than last. They're doing way bigger things way earlier and building their bases rapidly, rather than putting them aside or moving slowly. It's awesome
Possible name for the alley: Tunnel Town
How about “diamond alley” instead of diagon alley”
a building that is about to fal over but kept up bi pillars and stuf
The G-alleyway
I love how Grian is just scolding scar like he is a child.
Please make the copper dam a permanent looking landmark at some point!
What if you made a hermit hotel in in the griagon ally
How many times, Grian  How many times
"It happens" XD
😇🥲🙏 whoops
You Sub count is Noice
you should add a backstreet ally to your ally. also you could call it vertic ally
69 lakh sub's huh lol
I love how Grian's excuse for taking Mumbo's copper was that he 'genuinely wanted it.' "Um... but officer... I wanted it..."
Ничего непонятно но очень интересно
The alley should be named "Mumbo Moustache Alley"
EYYYY GRIAN MUMBO IS BETTER THAN U
Just blame the lag if you didn't finished the building LOL 🤣
*Losing Stuff Again*  Game: New Achievement, You Lost it again  Game: "Tips, Stop falling in the void."
Name the alyway: The unnamed allyway
8:20 I got a name The Boatem Alley
oop earlyyyyyyyy squad
ally name: dountain ally
Put a tip sign and chest
Wonk Alley, AlleyWonk, Wonkly road,,,   ,,, some dumb names for the alley lol
ahhhh yes another trading montage
Call the alley the valley, since its underground and is kinda cave themed.
The alley in a valley
Grian: Laggity laggity your copper is now my property.
Another episode another time grian makes my day
The alleyway's name should be the City of lights. It's a nice name for a nice base
in the copper dam area, a waterfall would look quite nice there
Instead of calling it Alleyway  U should call it ' Rally Way'
cmon name the alley DiEggon alley
“Do it for the diamonds”                          -Grian
The lag on this server is craazy
Really hoping someone turns the 'r' in Scar build here into a 'T'
Scar’s train should just bulldoze right between Grian and Mumbo’s mountains
Grian you should build a build a bank in the toad and cll it grian  gots insted of gringots
This is one of the funniest videos I’ve ever seen
griangonally
Uh oh, is him comparing the deep slate cost to logs giving anyone else undercut vibes?
kinda cool how mining the deepslate makes a rly cool shaped cave
Alley Wonka!!!
Can someone tell G to try and look at kingdomhearts that game has a lot of these types of building
Why do u have 6.9 mil subs xd 69
IVE SAID IT BEFORE AND ILL SAY IT AGAIN. DIA-GRAIN ALLEY
Grian: LOSING EVERYTHING (again) Philza dying in hardcore after loads of hard work 3 times: First time?
UR SERVER IS SO LAGGY!!
The AllyGrain DOUBLE KILL
Grian: scar need to not overthinking and build here Scar: Ima gonna build swaggon parking house and some more things, and then build some flying base for gigabase
We all know 13 is unlucky.
Amazing to see Grian talking about ‘The Back’
That whole Scar segment was comedy gold
He’s the only one selling deep slate so why doesn’t he just crank the price up
Only like if subbed under 6.9m
I’d love scar to just build above all 4. A mountain and a cloud. The mountain part goes between you and Pearl and the cloud could come out of impulses chimney
Congratulations for 6.9 million subscribers lol
Nice vid
"Most of these buildings have a substancial amount of *_Wonk_* , Look this ones got some *_Wonk_* , This ones got a bit of *_Wonk_*  and then these guys over here started getting more _Stable_ so just added a bit of *_W o n k_* "     -Grian 2021
You deserve it
That scar scene was hilarious
I see it’s still about the principle.
Make griangotts bank
Hermitcraft season 8: couldn't wait for 1.18 so let's all build mountains and caves
W aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, !
it is a fair price, but id put it for like 3-4 diamonds per  stack
NAME IT THE TILTING CAVERN!!! Its in a cave and has tilted buildings :)
NOT AGAIN!!!!!!! what if this happens again
L
a cool easter egg to add to the alley would be putting in the sherlock holmes building from season 6
If grian is building a bank, then he must make a gringott’s spin off with Cleo making goblins using armour stands…
RIP Grian, consumed by hubris
15:01 scar breacking bedrock that bedrock was probably part of the custom textures datapack
Fix the damn hole
oh man i can't wait to see the fanart of this episode
Name for the alleyway; Diagrian Alley
What would be proper base for most players is only a starter base for Scar. Let's all have a moment to appreciate  Scar and all other Hermits for what effort they make to give us the best content on YT.
you should call the alleyway diagrian alley!!
First 40nmins pogerrss
Im honestly suprised grian didnt name the aley thr Galey
Decent name for the alley way: dwarven alley
6:20 well not really because since you found diamonds you are going to make double profit , if I go mining for coublestone and diamonds and find more diamonds then the ones I am going to get from selling the coblestone it doesn't mean that I collected the coublestone for nothing, it means that I am going to profit much more
carma in it's finest
The comedic timing of scar sounding the swaggon horn as grian asked if he had to buy the trident back was so great!!
Scar wants a giant cloud
Are you going to make a habit of negotiating while endangering people's lives to gain leverage? Is this a thing now?
Grian please name the alley “Wonky Way” or “Wackey Way”
Grian can you make a bardge theemed bulding
btw y did u not just give scare a ender pearl?
Call it the dragon-egg alley
Aulten Alley should be the name
You should name the alleyway diagonally
Grian just name your base as the Grian ally
Grian: the alley The fans, the intellectuals: diagrian alley
Diorite ally Pun on diagon ally
If you think about it, mining the deep slate and then selling it to make the same amount of diamonds you got from mining, you will be receiving double the diamonds for the same time.
Grian and Scar's dynamic is just the best, loving every second of it
Grain: look how slow this is Me with my iron pic 👁👄👁
When he started mining the blocks away under Scar over the hole, I was cringing, remembering the title of the video.
immediately after I saw the title I said, (very loudly) "Again??" and I thought people might like to know
GRIAGAN ALLEY is it’s name
How are you doing Grian?
He should call it “wonk walkway”
I have a name idea for the base what about "The Galley"
Next thing you know, Mumbo ends up building a ''Scar build here, I'm Potatman (Batman)'' sign
a little bit of wonk
Scar in a bedrock pit is just the 3rd life season 2 trailer
Boatem of the mountain alley.  Also you could put the Boatem HQ at the end where the bank would be.
Scar’s base is going to be a cloud I’m pretty sure
Great base:)
21:27 Oh no this is going to become a major plot point isn’t it
griagon alley and griangotts bank
Potential name for the ally: Diagrion ally
just call it the gally
Mount ally, mount g Ally
"deepslate is so hard to mine!" meanwhile the rest of us who have unenchanted iron pickaxes......"let me press f on the worlds smallest keyboard"
If I were scar I'd build a floating base where the words are
...You totally deserved that for spleefing Scar in, lol
The alley should be named “Verticalley”
Scar would be a bad game dev he suffers from feature creep
Grianaly
Name the alley "Diagrian alley"
they need to make feather falling helmets for all the players wo smash there faces into the ground flying elytra. (including me)
I saw that happen in chat on bdubs live stream yesterday
I like how Grian acknowledges deepslate before diamonds
You should call the alley diagrian alley
Read properly, *Grain-a Alley* can sound very close to Diagon Alley.
Grian I already said this on another video, but you should name your alley "Diamond Alley" because it's a mix of a cave (where you would find diamonds) and Diagon alley.
Diagrian alley should be the name
You forgot to get scars irreplaceable hat back.
Hey grian!! For the back building make it a bank for your diamonds (gringotts) :)
Call the aly the g-way
@grian call the alley the galley
I will now get extremely worried every time grian goes near the boatem hole
GRIAN IS THE BEST
Call the alley" The G-alley" (The Galley)
E
Had some idea names, The wonky Walkway, The Underalley.
Why is it that people named scar always seem to like to push people off a cliff? *Simba screams intensify*
Call it The griopi aley
addd more WONK
Name your base “the alley Cave”
for the tiles in the ally way try using deepslate tiles i used them on my friends SMP
Architect Alley. just an idea.
The boatemalley?
Craftmine
BRING POULTRYMAN BACK!!!!!
The ally should be named based an all the boatem members combined like how the mumbo+grian=grumbo+scar=grumbar+pearlescentmoon=grumbarscent+impulseSV=imgrumbarscent the name creation is limitless
You could call the alleyway the “Gally” or the “Galley Way”      Grian + Alley
Make grian plush pls
Can you do season 2 of 3 life’s that was so fun and funny specially when scat traded people as a scam
Hope everyone is having an amazing day and staying safe
Scar is crazy
you need to call the alley griagon alley
Hi Brian you probably won’t read this but thank you for cheering me up when I was depressed making me laugh when no one else could bringing a little brightness into my life
Gallyway the pronunciation is almost like galway it have a nice ring to it
What if you called it “Agate Alley”
19:47 booties??
You Can Put Shops In The Buildings And Call The Town "StonksWart" Like Hogwarts :) :) :)
Name suggestion for the alley: Galley way.
Moo
Grain, 3stk/5dia isn’t a smoking deal, but it’s a standard sales tactic
Anyone else thinkig grian should play 12 minutes
How about Griano-ally
Grally
the alleyway should be called boatem alley
Sweet new Ep
Gria-gon Alley?
“I’m ѕυвѕ¢яιвιηg тσ єνєяуσηє ωнσ ѕυвѕ¢яιвєѕ тσ мє αη∂ ℓιкєѕ тнιѕ ¢σммєηт”
ok
Imagine scar builds a "no" above grian's message
In the start I thought that I was watching    season 7
griab put a church at the end  all the alley of the abby
i hope we get a griangotts building
Okay, I have a few names for the alley. 1. Diagrian Alley 2. Griagon Alley 3. I don't have a third, I just thought three was a well rounded number for a list, so-
*points at "scar build here" sign* There's no sign of scar building here.
22:29 Ok, that was really cool
Isnt the big eyes sells one of those did you die boxes?
Why don't u make a g-train train station on they other side of the cave
Youtube is lagging somehow u liked my comment.
I think you should name the alleyway ‘Amethyst Alley’! I dunno If that’s good but it’s my suggestion
If i see a strange looking man taking photos in london i know it is u
Grian dies  Boatem crew:revenge is sweet
griagon alley it would be a funny name :)
call the alleyway wonk
Grian Grian Grian... losing everythin again
everyone watch past the goodbye theres a secret
Stop losing things, Grian, or the next thing you lose will be your marbles.
Make a gringotts-ish type bank and make it you storage system......
Call the alley way Galley if u do see this can u pin it pls if u like it
Galleyway or Gralleyway sounds kinda good
Who else thinks that Grian would have massive success if he started doing Disasters again?
Does anyone else agree he needs to make Weasley Wizard Wizzes as a building there
I'm telling you Dragon Egg Alley
Call the alley diagrian alley
the alley should be named "the Great Really Interesting Amazing Network of buildings" (if u dont get it read all the capitalized letters)
Congrats on 6.9 mill subs!
WONK
Creeper who just wanted to buy a ender Perl and grain nah that’s to op (kills the creeper)     🥲
mayeb there could be shops in the building
2 hours to mine all that deepslate, plus the 120 diamonds, grian you're making $2.7 trillion an hour if we're assuming those massive diamonds are worth $15 billion
GRAIN!!! Make a sky castle on a floating island plss plsss plsss
you need to build "griangotts" at the end of the alley
grian ally way name griangoneally
Put a barge on a train
this is a bad pun for ur alley but: cave in dutch = grot, so maybe call it gralley which (now i wrote it down) could also stand for 'grian alley'
Idea for alleyway name: G Aalley or Giga Alley
The bank teller thing has to be called 'Griangotts'
karma for grian
You should start a counter for every time someone dies in the bottum hole
If you’re still taking name suggestions for the alley, why not “ bygone alley” since you an mumbo ended the tree war and joined bases together in peace (letting bygones be bygones). Plus it sounds like diagon alley, so there is that :>
I love how the sign says “place your *shag* here” lmfao
You should call your base “emerald ally”
No one appreciates the hold on pun when scar was in the hole
Grian Hi 🤚🤚🤚🤚🤚🤚🤚🤚🤚
wheres gringots?
the last clip was legendary XD
hey? what about naming the alley the gully? i mean gully stands for alley way in hindi and it sounds like, u know the "grian alleyway" i mean ik it's not da best idea but i think it's pretty cool
Your little Street should be called the pun Street
Dia-Grain Alley  Idk, its really bad but it popped into my head when you said unnamed alleyway
Grian, stop trying to make other hermits make the back of your bases!
If Grian lives in the alley, then the G-train is basically 'alley express'
6.9 subscribers NICE   Edit: name for ally: noback ally (because no back)
Next season every hermit make a base together and it becomes a terra base
Hey Grian when is 3rd life season 2 starting?
DIAGON VALLEY. Just putting it out thier
Alleyway name suggestion  Grim Alley
You’re doing great Grian!!
why dont you have live-streams where we can see you mine, and grind, full time? i would love that!
Charge more for deepslate! Double it XD
Grian: apart from breaking my neck Me: you dont have a neck 🙃
8:18 call it the ally-a or the ali-a
You should call it “Squid Alley” because Diagon Alley is diagonally. Your alley is squiggly.
I think that the alley should be named wonky walkway
Season 9 gonna be the g-plane?
day 1 of telling grian to get netherite
scar knows he is going to die so much that he wants 4 full requips lol
Grian was definitely right when he said he wasn't going to build a mega base, just not in the way he thought.
If you are gonna keep losing all your stuff why even try making the armor, at that point you are just wasting diamonds if you keep on losing stuff to the boatem hole. Lol
The grianway the galyway
Block
grian if you see this then next season you should make a plane that sells things like the train.
wait HOLEd on hahahahahaha
name for the alley: Griagon Alley
32 mins
You should name the "alley way" baker street as in, the song baker street
Dude lag is weird
It’s not about the money… its about sending a message
18:19  Do you guys here the strange creepy sound on the background? It's like the purge siren but inhaling
Build a locomotive in front of the G-Train
I Was Just Thinking When Will The Next Video Come. And Then You Publish It In 1 Minutes
Your pumping out videos like no tomorrow
I’m no pro but I think you need to build the alleyway even longer
the galley grian alley i dont know sounded funnier in my head...
Whose idea even was that stupid hole?! Oh, right…
Hey I want to see the mcc stream
The Bank shoud be named Griangotts
Wow this the earliest Ive been
This video is going to be the funniest  video I've watched all day
10:41 I'm not too sure that says shack, fella...
I'm gonna demand wild cats in the alley
A name for the alleyway: *"Griagon Alley"*
place your what here????
Hermitcraft Season 6: Sahara. Hermitcraft Season 7: The Barge. Hermitcraft Season 8: The G-Train. Grain is clearly a natural merchant.  Edit: Yeah, The Pesky delivery season 7. Grian is a talented merchant.
The Galley way could be a name for it
call it Hermit's Hollow
It should be driagrian alley :)
Grian, I love your videos keep going!!! BTW I have an idea for a name for the alley- Rally
I wish you had found the secret entrance
You should name the alley Horizon Alley, both because Diagon is similar to Diagonal, and because Horizon Alley sounds nice in general
No-Back Alley
I'm calling it Rockturn alley. Feel free to put your alley names here in the replies.
Try to start an episode like iskall, like hmmm. Hmmmmmm
1.17 doesn't add mountains.  Hermits: fine i'll do it myself
Perhaps name your base the G-alley.
Put a sign that says: limited edition on the deep slate cart
G-train shirts coming soon?????
G - agonalley
:)
Hol up mine for diamonds every day for two hours.
Name for the alley suggestion. Silly I know but hera me out.  Grian+Alley= Gralley (and any other remix of the dictionary you choose)
I actually think "unnamed alleyway" is a good name for the alleyway
Ideas for the name of the base Diagon Depths- like the depths of diagon alley  Crooked Community   Birmingham- because burmingham is kinda shady and a place youd get stabbed much like a crooked alleyway   (Last one is just a joke name please dont kill me anyone who lives in Birmingham)
grain [intentional] speaks of apocalypse  viewers: NOT AGAINNNNN!!!!!
He’s at 6.9 million subscribers, balance as all things should be
Grian saying «lets go» never gets old
The grianyway
Grian legit died in the void trying to save scar what a bro
Wonk! I love that
Diagrian Alley theres a name :D
You can name the alley Griagonal Alley
Boatem  Hole is and awsome Meme! Hermits are insaine! :)
hi
Bank should be called griangot. :D gringots, griangots???
Good job Grian
You definitly need a narrow but taaall building
Uhhh scar is building a cloud castle in the sky..
Deep slate is what taught me how to figure out item ID's so I could download a veinmine data pack and then add deep slate to it
The grianalley!
Okay, you've stepped in it. Gringott's style bank with crazy rail way tracks or riot.
noo dont lose nooo plz i hate that dont lose
19:58 Missed opportunity: "Tri-dent in my diamonds"
Call the alleyway ,stonewall way
@grian if scar doesn't build in the place you want him to offer him the stuff for 200 diamond instead of 4 and more deals till the server is going on
lol
You should add small bits of coal blocks in the slate pile so that it looks more organic
The alley can be called "Dia-Grianalley" which sounds like diagonally
Name it Grime Alley as an homage to bat-tat (mumbo)
No matter what you name the alley, I'll always refer to it as "Dia-Grian Alley"
Grian: oh no scat fell Mambo: its probably lag
Name the alley horizontalley. Or verticalley.
Hola
Call it topsy-turvy town
If you mine the deep slate and get diamonds and sell the deep slate, you get even more diamonds
6.9 mill subs lol
In the back you should do your ofice
How about The Griagon alley for the alley?
My Favorite things in a hermitcraft episode! Theft! Blackmail! Fantastic.        Keep up the great work Grian!
Call the ally come again country
WONK
“We don’t allow window shopping here,” Creeper: watch it, or I’ll make my own window.
Congrats on 6.9 million subs  Nice
We’ve been making progress.                   Slow progress progress but slow and it takes you 1 episode for Mum o to make 2 episodes and finish recording a 3rd SSSLLLLOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW
i've never realised how terrifyingly empty grian's eyes are. it's like i'm staring into the void aND THE VOID IS STARING BACK
Call the allyway the underground as it will be under the whole mountain
when you opened the episode with "TODAYS EPISODE!" i thought you were gonna say you were sponsored by raid shadow legends
"OI!! SCAR, MATE, BUDDY, PAL!! PLACE YOUR SWAG HERE!!" has to be the most australian thing to say from Pearlescentmoon.
GRIAN GOT TO 6.9mil 🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿
Angled Avenue
You could call the alleyway the galley (grian-alley)
9:29 netflix whenever they need character development:
Name the alley Grove Street
14:34 "Doesn't that have curse of binding on" "No no" "(Quietly) damn it
6.9M nice
The Grain Alley
You know how some people spend forever in shops, taking their time to look through everything that’s up for sale- And some people will go to little outlet malls or just other places where they’ve got a lot of shops and dilly-dally. So what if you called the Alley “Dilly-D-Alley”? Since people would theoretically be spending plenty of time appreciating the buildings and looking for what they want to get
Fun fact if we go in void where we start getting damage we can not survive with elytra and rocket
Diagrian Alley ?
Names- Diagonalley Grian Or Diagonalley G
He had been missing for over 1year
dude, i'm having flashbacks from 3rd life
Bring back sahara
The name of the ally should be diamond ally
Grian, 2021: Im about to do something realy schewpit!
Grian: We have a long painful process ahead of us Us: What nice timelapse music! :D
Perfect episode for someone who JUST got the UnderTale True Pacifist ending!  Edit: Put a vault in the back of the base to store your diamonds from the G-Train in.  Edit 2: Name your alleyway the Grianon Alley.
Grian: gets a deal for 400 diamonds Also Grian: Stonks
Me: You uploaded an episode but what did it cost you.  Grian: everything
Hermitagon alley
Hi
Hollow home. A lovely name for the alley
my question is, before grian and scar fell in the hole, was   why did grian have a wooden shovel?
Oh my GOD GRIAN!!!, Be careful nexttime!
Stonks 📈
Wait what its posible to break bedrock with zour hand in hermitcraft i mean just look at the block on top of scar when he hits it at 15:10
rip top hat
Can you return poultryman
I just spent 10 minetes writeing a LONG messege of how scar can make bases in pearls impolses and grians mega bases but now thats useless...  Edit: i wrote the messege on scars chanal
welcome back to a nother hermatcraft video of grian loosing diamonds on dieing
Such a great episode. So many laughs.
Grein, if you think that collecting deepslate like that is boring. Try draining the entire nether with only sand collected with a wooden shovel
cant you have a lake of some sort in the end of the cave
OMG CALL THE ALLEYWAY GRIANGOTS (Gringotts)
Griagon alley
Grian complaining about how hard Deepslate is to mine makes me feel a little self conscious Because when I mine, I find it really relaxing when it's a slower process. I almost never use diamonds for picks unless I'm looking for obsidian
Watching at 12:00 A.M (IST) 😎👌🏻
"If I don't get something done by the time this oxidizes, the server will result in apocalypses." *forshadowing*
You should have gringots at the end of the alliway
Make an interior of your base plz
everyone gangsta til grian shows your house as inspiration.
A netherite pickaxe would have been even faster
Make the name of the ally way some stoneworks ally cause it's in a mountain
Alley name idea: something nautical to go with boatem such as Starboard Alley, Bermuda Avenue, or something better than I can come up with😂
You should call grianagol alley or griangon alley
call it diagrian ally
Grian thinks he's rich but I don't think he's seen pearl's diamonds
the new trend is to fall through the boatem hole and lose all of your items
Triahonaly
This is REALLY starting to turn into Diagon alley. Big bank at the end of an alley filled with shops?    Yeah. Diagrian alley.
🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔
DUDE THIS IS GONNA BE THE SHOPPING AREA, HAVE THE BANK... BE REALLLLLLLLL
Diagrian alley? I know its dumb, good video anyways.
You should call the alley horizontally
Hey Grian name the alley Hermigon alley because it's like hermit and diagon mixed together
Here me out mumbo is the ceo of boatem inc boatem inc is a shopping district so doesn’t that somewhat make MUMBO MAYOR?
I gotta say the boatem hole is the best and the worst addition at the same time this season
He wants a cloud, not a mountain.
19:36 am i the only one that it looks streched too? btw awesome video grian
May I remind everyone that our beloved Diagon Alley  sounds an awful lot like diagonally so I propose we call Grian's base horizontally or horizon alley
Grian, I have a solution to the deepslate problem! TNT duper tunnel bores should be awesome at mining deepslate. The simple, 1-wide design by borkon should still be about as fast both in mining and to to set up as a haste-II beacon, a better set up would blow it out of the park.
damn it grian not again
A name suggestion for the alleyway; "the Galley"
how about you call the ally the "VerticAlly"
I think he should have named the trident "Tri to make me do this again."
Will the good thing is Deepslate will be easy to get in the 1.18 update.
12:02 Is it confirmed! Grian is a Super Smash Bros fan!!!
Griangon ally
If Id had a nickle for how many times Grian has lost everything I'd had 2 nickles. It's wierd that it happened twice
Can we all agree that the alley should be named "Grain Alley"
0:48 facTREE
The tiles are my fav deepslate
yoooooo 6.9 mill subs
After the g train i bet it will be the g plane
Did I mention that I absolutely love the time lapse music!
Name it - cave town (suggestion)
How did Grian get two brain cells? I'm still working with one.
I see Grian differently as a minecraft YouTuber now that I've seen how good he was in MCC
use smelter to make the copper smelting faster
At this rate you guys are gonna run out of elytra
Scar walked off into the hole by himself so grian shouldn’t have needed to make him head for free
Hey grian what editor do you use?
NOOOOOOOOOOO
The Cavealley
MUMBO STEALS YOUR BEACON!!
please think before doing stuff :(
Griagon Alley
Amazing video as always!
Holy. does this mean mumbo and grian share 2 brain cells  also grian a idea for the bank is griangotts bank.
the laggwars have begun...
You should name your alleyway gregonalley
just make mumbo pay a stack of deepslate for each hour of beacon usage, u get deepslate and he gets beacon :)
.
Grian, you can name the alley....BOATEM street
Lol nice subscriber count  Edit: this was written when he had 6.9 million
Grian hermitcraft go brrrrrrrr
Why not name it Griagon Alley?
You should have counter how much items were sacrificed to the mighty hole
early
F
Just finished ep 12
he should make gringots bank or should i say griangots
Day 3 of asking grian to start season 2 of third life
I feel like Grian would make a good irl business man
Hey grian.  Just thought of something you could add to your alley.   A bowling alley would not only be a mini game but also be another source of diamonds while also referencing the fact that (I think) the place you are building is a tourist attraction.
The Galley-way (G for Grian)
6.9 Million subs lol.
Get some debris blue boi!!!
The Alley is a pretty good name.
Idea for the deep slate cart: one of the fuel/oil tanks that are basically long cylinders
A name for the alleyway, perhaps Dia-Grian Alley, as in Diagon Alley. Then for the bank or the main central building, it could be named Grian-Gotts, as in Gringotts, as I'm sure you're familiar with!
Just an idea for the alley way,.maybe it can be called slanted street
Grian is just everybody’s mind “if I don’t do something before it oxidizes, the server will end” meanwhile other people “if I don’t reach that tree before that car I’ll die”
You could rent out half the buildings for others to put their shops in, to make boatem the new shopping district
1st boatem meeting Grian: lol you punched mumbo into the void buy my perhaps you persished parcel _Few episodes later_ Scar: lol you punched me into the void now buy my trident
5:12 Now Grian can feel like us bedrock players that can't even instamine stone with an haste 2 beacon efficiency 5 netherite pickaxe...
Wait was there any news ab third life 2? I just remembered it
I am here
The Alley should be called "It Alley"
I only need to say one thing WONK
Did you guys saw that grain has 6.9 sub rn ?
I always watch right till the last second so i can see things like this 22:30
Griangon alley
Grain
Call the aly way  the Ali way way
you should build a barge themed  carriage on the train
Make a poultry man base in 1 of the buildings of the alleyway pls
The name of the alley  Botem's Thoroughfare.
I know that it's based off of Diagon Alley, but you should call the alley Blockturn Alley. (parody of Knockturn alley)
They really should call the boatem shopping district ”Boughtem”
Diagrainally seems like a good name for the allyway
Early pog
You should call your base "THE ALLY CAVE"
GRIAN it would be cool if you rented out the buildings In The alleyway to make an extra bit of cash
6.9mil          nice
Might be a dumb idea but you soooo should've put ur small wood mansion that you sold in at the very end of the alley
15:08 for 1 moments you can see sacr mining bedrock
The Gr-alleyway maybe?
Suggestion for center build A gringrotts bank from Hp would be pretty cool
Why don't you name your base 'the unknown cave alley'
Don't feel too bad man I've lost atleast 5 sets of netherite in my world so far
Aragon alley
@Grian you should call it diagrain alley
Name it "The Gally"
The music in gorgeous(the one witch plays when you build)
How to call "The Alley": Dountain Alley I know, I will go back to my corner now
You know, TVTropes have a trope for the kind of incident that happened with Grian and Scar.  I won't name the trope, because it could cause some of youtube's modding issues
“I added a bit of wonk” “This whole alleyway is supposed to be wonky”  I thought that was impulse’s thing :P
Im watching this while im taking a bath at 2 am. Not kidding btw
There should be a bank at the end of the alley called Griangotts.
For inspiration for wonk: You can have two buildings lean away from each other and add a little rooftop garden in between the two. A little cozy place to sit in.
Name the alley "diagon alley" but come up with a pun because I'm bad at puns
I, personally, am excited for Griangotts in Griagon Alley.
If you're basing your megabase off of Diagon Alley then you should call it Dia-grian Alley
Grian, you should sell deepslate in full shulker boxes only. dont sell it per stack. make the hermits buy an entire shulker at once. and charge like 75 -100 diamonds per shulker!!!! but its your show, just my suggestion!! love you grian!!! hope you are still coming over for dinner !!!
GRAIN HIT 7M ALREADY!!!!  AGHHHHH I LOVE THIS CHANNEP
Scars face defiantly suits him, because of you asked, is this your starter base, and then followed on with because this is massive, that face would be perfect!
Its 2 am here in the Philippines and I'd rather watch Grian's hermitcraft episiode early than sleep
Straight street dollar store diagonal ally
Grian should name the alley Horizont-Alley, since it’s moving in a horizontal direction
LOSING EVERYTHING electric boogaloo
When one letter makes a message Jon family friendly. Swag v shag
Day 5 of telling grian to build (for the front of the G-Train) the 4014 Big Boy by Crafty Foxe. Please @Grian
the alley should be named the griagon alley
like diagon alley
it iook u a week 2 do this!!!!!????????
Grian... pls make the big building in the back a bank
The two brain cells caused the deaths
The hermit highway
Hey Grian, I have an Idea for your storage system. You could build the Goblin bank at the End of your alley!  I imagine it would look pretty awesome if you‘d build a massive Gate and a Bing chandelier etc. :)
Grian you should name your allyway the 'gallyway' and the cave the'Gave' because of  your name and the g train😂 what do you think?😂
Grian: I’m going to make a sign telling scar where to build so he doesn’t get confused and overthink it!! Everyone else in Boatem: NO SCAR BUILD HERE!!!!!!
"I do have to remeber how to activate my 2 brain cells" Mumbo: Are you challenging me ?
Grian when is 3rd life season 2 coming?
A big Bank at the end of the Alley sounds just great. Its an amazing addition of the Goal of being the main market area of the server. And a Bank as a symbol of capitalism just gives it the final touch in my opinion :)
Day 1 of telling Grian to name is base Wonkagon Alley
He should call the allyway “WONK ALLEY”
I have a cool idea for an alleyway name. "Scranton alley"
I was drinking while you were saying wonk and I almost spit all my drink all over.
I love just how grian tease scar giving him rocket.
F
again?
e
How about Griagon Alley?
You could use the back of your base for the boatem community centre or something!
Grain
No one tell him he is going to build the back of the mountain
Name of the ally: Wank Walk
Lag can be so weird like that sometimes!
gagon allie
You need a upside down house
J putting this out there Griagon alley
every time one of the hermits gets upset about how long things take to mine because it's not instant I die a little more inside
Oof
Officer! You’ve got to believe me! It lagged into my pockets! I would NEVER steal something!
DiaGrian Alley
Caves and cliffs update gets postponed..   Boatem Crew: Fine I'll do it myself
If I had a nickel for every time Grian lost everything, I would have two nickels, which isn't a lot, so this is why you always bet on Scar He's a consistent man
Grian: i only have 2 brain cells  7 million subs: exists
nice
Horizont alley or vertic alley.
i think u need to zombfiy and cure ur armorer and weapons smith villagers more then u can get the your boxes cheaper
Name it griogon alley
Grian: "People will be very excited to know that deepslate is..." The ad literally a millisecond after: "A next generation ecosystem"
ollivanders is on the wrong side Grian, i'm very disappointed with you, very disappointed
I feel like calling the ally way the "grally way" sounds cool and has a little bit of grian in it... Also sounds a little bit like gravel way and gravel could be implemented into the detail of grey blocks...
Suggestion to call the alleyway 'Hermiton alley'! Idk, just thought it'd be cool.
Alleyway name idea: ‘Hermits alley’
We all love the copredam
Fun fact : Now, Grian has 6.9 million subs.
Should’ve poured lava into Scar’s hole.
Idea for naming the alley: Diagon G-alley
“This mining only got us 6 shulker boxes” ONLY 6? Bro thats a huge fucking amount!
I get the notification I press the notification LOL
G alley maybe
Griagon alley? Or Griangon alley I don't know it just came to me lol!
Omg please grian name the alley “Diagrian alley”
is scar breaking that bedrock?? 15:06
Grian: We're sending Scar a message  Everyone: **vietnam war flashbacks**
The end cutscene was hilarious
Will technically you both mess up 😂
The Void is not Grian Proof
Trenton ally , grain lane,  just a few ally names
Grian should name the ally hodgepodge lane
grainyaly = diagnlaly you get it its meaid by grian and its grainy
Grian you should put some cars in the ally way…
nothing like instant karma for messing with scar there, huh...?
grian should call it the Gallyway or something
I have been watching hermitcraft for 1 year now
15:47 seems like everyone is falling in bedrock holes nowadays
Me: enough  YT for today lets do somethign else, *sees grian posting hermitcraft episode Uhhhhhm...  I didnt say anything
When you make the bank you should call it bank topless
"wonk" I like it!   that's my opinion            and mumbo stole your beacon
Alley name suggestion: Horizont Alley
ONLY SIX I CANT EVEN FILL ONE WITH ONE BLOCK
call it the Grally Grian+ alley
Grian loves your video ❤️❤️❤️🥺
Scar: “those are just the things in the fine print we never read” Me: business
Next build or rather should I say copy a log farm and go into the tree business
Shack lol
Grain should definitely make a bank and call it Griangotts
Mumbo: *Makes Teleportation device so ppl don't die in hole*  Grian & Scar: We don't need that device. Also Grian & Scar: *die in hole*
Grian died two times now, because of the boatem hole. This might could be the curse of the boatem hole!
Damn... Double homicide
helo grian i might have covid so just now that seeing you do what you love making everyone around you happy helps alot
Karma
You should name the ally diagon vally or sally OR Diagonal ally or vally OR DIAGONAL SALLY
VIDS ARE COMEN FAST YO
Grian: I wanna build the copper dam again Mumbo: With your own copper right?
I looked at the tittle and I was like how did it happen this time
You should put up a bulletin board that has a list of all the sacrifices to the Boat'Em Hole.
Y’know, you could just pull an Impulse. Call it “The G-alleyway.” Like alleyway. But Grian themed.
You should name the alley the under alley
The fact that grian has 6.9 million subs made my day
why dont u call the alley horizontal alley hAhahaHAH geT iT
Watch the copper never oxidize because Scar waxes it.
Grian: *asks Impulse to blow a massive hole out of the bottom of the world* Also Grian:
ge
When u let 2 children play near the void
Hey g man make a shop on a massive slant like the top bit nearly falling off
Love it
if he's using Diagon alley as some inspiration I propose the name being Griagon Alley or some variation of that
If Grian had a nickel for each time  he lost everything, he'd have two nickels which isn't much but its weird that it happened twice.
GRIAGON ALLEY sorry for caps it’s just for you to notice
To really consider how much money you get from deepslate. You need to think about how easy it is to get (aka how often it spawns) vs how often diamonds spawn. I feel like it would be more worth it, since its an abundant resource that is hard to gather.
You could call the alley Diagrian Alley. You don’t have to if you don’t want to
Grian should name the ally G-Ally.
OI! SCAR, MATE, BUDDY, PAL, BUILD HERE
Good name for the Alley would be: prominence-Boulevard!!
Three or Four diamonds per stack of Deepslate.  Everyone wants it but no one wants to get it.
The galley?
They look nothing like what they're suppose to look like, they kinda are the same shape but doesn't look like the pic
“Losing all my items” (again)  Scar: hey thats my job
Grian: My content is PG13 and i don't swear.   Also Grian: *name the boots booties*
Call it dragon ally and the entrance could be a fireplace like in the movies with a piston Edit: Make a big pile of raw gold blocks and diamonds blocks in your main base and make it a dragon-like den plz it would be cool
Reject dream smp embrace hermit craft
People disliking the video? Must have been lag XD
Call the alleyway Horizontalley.
You should call the alleyway " The GalleyWay " (grian+alley)
grian hows this name for ur ally?  "Grinwale Alley"
THE TIMELAPSE SON MADE A RETURN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Alternative title... KARMA
im i late? i think i am ;-;. I would only except that im earrly if i watch 1 minutes away since uploaded lol
grian: you know... imma just go down to the boatem hole to find a  scar stuck in a nook of bedrock and threaten him to build in my spot so that i don't have to build the back of my mountain... MWAHAHAHHAHHhahhhHSAHjhaAHhh
I thought Scar wanted to build on a cloud
Diagrian  Alley
The best business of hermit craft is Deepslate somebody should take a note 📝.
Only scar could get trapped in a hole with no escape and only grian could cause and event this catastrophic
Scares hat noooo
the Gallyway ????? maybe ?????? just maybe
I would like to suggest Horizont as a name for your Alley! Or perhaps Vertic?
If you spread copper it will oxidize faster
Grain don’t feel guilty for making scar go in the void cuz he punched you in and made you lose your stuff
You should make hermitcraft streams
Wonk
The ally should be called diagonal street (like diagonal ally)
Diagrian alley
HERE WE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Grain u should take a clip every few episodes and by the end of the season you can have like a never before seen footage video from the whole season just a thought
also when he named the armor i totally thought of the ''classy, bougie, ratchet'' 💀
If you build a bank you should call it Griangotts
15:03 when scar tries to break bedrock and makes a dent and then failed
Hi this the first comment that I sent within one hour hi grian you make so much amazing stuff thank you for inspiring me
Idea For A Bank Name in The Alley: Grian-gots bank
Name for the Alley - The Alley Scanally
Maybe the alley could be called *’Griagon Alley’* (Diagon Alley)  Edit: And the bank could be called *’Griangotts’* (Gringotts) - Credit to Emerald Entertainment for that one
we need a food hall in the Alley called the Galley, if this doesn't happen I'm gonna be sad
Name for the "ally" Grian + Ally = Gally (Also Bro ur at 6.9 Subscribers 😏)
Idea:  Griangon Alley :3
Grian: Deepslate is hard to mine Mumbo: Deepslate is hard to mine Mojang: You're hard to please
**AGAIN**
I feel so bad for scar he was in that whole for so long and then just tragically died unintentionally 😭
So the bank at the end HAS to be called "Griangotts"
well, the only good thing about deepslate is that its garunteed
Idea for next tag game: hat, you get something like scars hat and you wear it at all times but people can try everything to get it, murder, scams, or just traps until you give it Oh and 6.9m subs 🥵
Scar was so proud of that pearl though as well lol😂
Grian: droppes scar in the void karma: well its your turn now
Name the alleyway the G-way
Nice try grian, you just want Scar to finish the back of the mountain! 😂
hi
It would be funny if you push scar in the boatem hole with lots of cobwebs!
Idea for a fun "Alleyway" name. Boatem of the Barrel! B)
my finger lagged its way to the like buttone 😫
Karma
Scar: *dies* Also Scar: Stonks
If you're not sure about what's to come in the end of the alley, how about you recreate gringots idk if it's spelled like that buuttt it's the big bank with the underground vaults. Maybe that's a cool idea.
Petition for the alley to be called underroot alley(Cuz it’s underground)
Just rralized this came out 20 min ago
Ally the alleyway, has a nice ring to it. Something you came up with temporarily, maybe something that you keep forever.
Hey grian can you make me a blue house that has a chicken farm in it And it says on top "Leaf's Chicken"
Grians beacon "lagging" is so funny
Call the alley Diagonally after that little oopsie in HP
*lag*
Call the alley “die-again alley “ or “dia-grian alley”
The Gallyway
Grian killed a creeper :(
Actually Grian, remember jumping into the boatem hole is how you seal the deal?
Name for the ally way, the gally- way, G for grian of corse
The boatem hole is the most expensive idea grian has ever had
Call the alley “The Galley” or “The Galley Way”
@Grian name the alley "Griagon Alley"
l
Maybe a wonk.
using speed potion can help the process i think
every time grian dose terraning scar dose the back
Didn't Grian said he wanted to leave alley ways in between the buildings?
New Hermit Rule : If your stuff goes missing, just blame lag
Griagon Alley
Hey buddy old pall place your shag here  MADE MY DAY🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Dammit scar was so excited to build by impulse base
Alley name: Grian's Alleywonk
(Name idea-) Alleyway of secrets
That's the best mumbo and grian interaction I've seen to this day lmao
“Apart from breaking my neck, what are we actually doing today?” -Grian, 2021
5:25 was so wholesome, you sounded so happy and proud of your transition into the time lapse, and you gave a little chuckle that sounded like a child and made me so happy. You sounded like you enjoyed what you were doing despite the grind ahead of you. :) thanks for always making such wonderful videos
Call your alley DiGrionAlley.
I died in the void yesterday and lost a 99% finished map and my elytra so that's not fun...
Diagonal alley is my suggestion for a name
Grain
I mean scar did promise to build the back of your base...
the title should've been ''i died again (i forgor..)''
Grian spread your copper out don't make it a damm
Add floating candles I think it would fit your base
Call it Grally
"It's about sending Scar a message"  Here it comes, bois, here it comes...
Lag these days
Beetroot-agon alley or soemthing to do with beetroots, it works with you shirt and you can be mumbo's foil
It seems like the “Perhaps you Perished Parcel”s can come in handy…
If you make a conduit then go outside it and dig, you will have super mining until the effect runs out! It’s my most effective way of making large holes to hurt my friends with :)
the ally should be named  oblique street
congratulation Griant  to reached 6.9 million subscribers and love ur VDO keep it up
Every day the hermitcraft server gets more and more chaotic, and I'm here for it
The galley G for Grian
Grian is a bit of a wonker it seems!
LAGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!
16:33 Karma be like.
you could call the alley, the elven gateway
Alley should be called veryic alley and then make one in the nether called horizont alley
you should make the center building the storage system and call it the "griangots bank"
A decent name for the your base is Diagon valley.
A Name for the Area should be Wonky Road
This is just tourture!
"I'm just calling it "the alley" until I have a name for it" Me: hehe. Call it the gralley
Are we gonna ignore that Grian is getting Scar to build there to avoid building the back of the base
I LITTERALLY SAID ARE YOU BUILDING DIAGON ALLEY AND THE FIRST PHOTO WAS OLLIVANDERS. Name the place Griagon Alley.
Diagrain Alley
iemand nederlands?????
I got covif
How about naming the alley Diagrian Alley?
Honestly who isn't loosing all there stuff am I right
Just here to get some likes  Come on just give it a like I know you want to
Grian: this alley is unnamed so we will just call it 'the alley' Me: if the alley is in a cave, and the cave is on the surface... New name for the alley, The Surface Cave Alley!
Next time you give scar a trident name it FOR THE LAST TIME TRI THIS
hello earlings
Noice
Its not about the money its about sending the message
Ayyy posted
I like tilted towers for the name of the alleyway.
6.9 million subscribers nice
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the quality of Grian's Hermitcraft series? So much effort must go into making these episodes!
You should call the alley crooked lane
288 views and 373 likes?? Grian has the youtube hacks on man
Nice
11:58 Ah yes I see Grian also struggles to spell definitely
Aren't you bascally just creating Diagon Alley at then point?  Or.. Diagonal Alley ;)
The griadon ally or griadon ally
lmao
you look like halfaslepshris
We need a boatem pole death count at the end of the season lol
2 brain cells must be stressed from ur crazyness of not doing the back of ur builds
You should call the alleyway The Crevice
(๑•̀ω•́๑)
I was thinking that I wanted to watch a new episode of Hermitcraft, and here it is ! 😂 Right at the right time 😂
ErEn jEgEr
Call the ally the gallery
digrian ally
I'm pretty sure the boatem hole has cost over 500 diamonds now
the barge the train what's  next a plane?
Early gang
Heh heh it's a grain
Name for the Alley ; DiaGrian Alley...Let the war of Scar begin...🏚️⛰️🎩...Great fun as usual..For safety's sake fill the hole with glass over the void😂😂
Grian, you know you have to build gringotts at some point right? Storage system + vault, it's perfect.
Hope you call it Vertic-Alley ( get it? Vertically cus it is tall)   Much love
You should keep a "Perhaps You Perished Parcel"in your ender chest (to avoid this kind of things)
I love how grian and mumbo use chat instead of proximity
Am I remembered season 7 in this video aloT
I like the name  Migri Alley
6.9m subs interesting
The amount of sheer brain cells in that move
For now I will call it the Gway
Here's a name idea the deepstep
Grian, at the end of the alleyway, you should have your house, have a living room, bedroom, everything you could need!
You should definitely make the giant building at the end of the alley super deep, maybe down to bedrock.
Base name concept: Crack ally  Yeah I know I know
Hey guys my handwriting has a bit of wonk
Only 6 chests full of deepslate
Mumbo "lag got your beacon here " grian " lag got your diamonds and copper in my inventory"
Call the ally, Hermigon ally from hermit and diagon
Call the ally Gilligan Ally Gilligan for Giga
I feel like you need to name your base, it was fine when the Mansion was called “The Mansion”.  But you’re building a street, I’d love to see a Diagon Alley esc name  Edit-O he already mentioned it
Thank you again Grian for making videos for us to watch. I'm going through a rough time with having to stay stranded in my room for a week since ive been exposed to covid.
Caveigon cliffeye is looking good so far
The way Grian heroically dived into the hole to save Scar and then ended up falling too deep… _perhaps Tatman has a rival?_
Scar is basically the God of minecraft at this point
grian : scar build here   scar : uh yeah no ima build somewhere else
Call the Alleyway Wonky Way
15:01 watch the bedrock
instead of making the street wider all the way how about adding a few indents for parks and benches?
The Grian Alley
So the left side has a bit of whonk? Why not have the right side be a little whack
You should name it Horizont Alley as a joke that this one goes straight (Diagon Alley = Diagonally Horizont Alley = Horizontally)
The build :   *5*  Grian : +Wonk  The build :   *S*
20 min gang
You should name the alley: mount trainkinshire
Grian why not call the alley mountalley
Grain makes my day honestly. Also motivates me to build stuff in minecraft
Well, deserved lmao
He's doing all these comparisons of mining speeds using different things, but he never upgrades to netherite pickaxe. 🤷‍♂️
can't believe lag would do this
8:20 you should call it the Underground City Caves
I have a name for the alley I would call it mount. Alley
grian lisson next time you see mumbo call him pttat Man. * edit: name the ally way the Missy forage ally *
:/
YAY I ENJOY GRIANS VIDEOS
Put some hidden faces in some of the windows and call it the Uncanny (V)Alley!
Please name it the dilly dally ally
Doesn't scar want to build a sky city?
Look 10:40
You should name it griangon alley or the ‘alley that must not be named’. Like so grian can see this please.
grain season 7: let's get scar to build the back of the mansion grain season 8: let's get scar to build the back of our base   *i sense a pattern*
You need to call the ally way the gally way because grian + ally= gally
TechnoSupport💖💖
The buildings have a lumbsum amount of “womp”
Good vídeo groin👍
A Grian video a week, keeps the big sad away. Thank you Grian, your videos keep me from feeling depressed.
Pog
"The onnamed alyway" honestly sounds pretty good and adds a bit of mystique
there was an AMETHYST above you when you were deepslate mining
diagon alley its a bit of a pun on diagonally so maybe use a similar pun
Dep Slate Ally
If you call the ally diagonal ally then your a legend
Hello grian this is kinda an akward question to ask in the video but there is a youtuber name hotsaucebeats he want to react to your hermitcraft video but you didnt answer it you probably didnt see it you can probably answer it
Grian you should name it the Horizon Ally(like diagon ally, but horizontal instead lol)
🥚
Upgrade to netherite
W O N K
Griangotts bank
6.9 subs
Not gonna lie, 'The Unnamed Alleyway' is actually a pretty good name. It has a ring to it.
how bout calling the alley "The Diamond Alley"? sounds like the Diagon Alley plus Grian likes to be rich in diamonds all the time. also, as he is planning to have a bank at the end of the alley way.
You should call the alleyway, Diagrott alley. A grotto is another word for cave
Idk if this sounds bad for a name for the alley name but I just thought of Giagon alley? Maybe.. It might sound rubbish but there's an option if you need help to decide!
A name for the Alley The G-Alley, or The Galley
Alleyway Name Idea:  UnnormAlley
The end of the alley should be gringots bank
Literally 2 minutes ago I was like hu I wonder when grian will post a new video and then I refreshed YouTube 😂
The bank could be named griangots
What about using end crystals to fame deep slate
yOOOOOOOOOO
Build a big bank at the back of the cave and call it Griangotts
I thought of a name for your base wonky way
I saw the video he made a waterfall door not in hermitcraft
Imor Alley?   It sounds like Immorally?
Try to mine deep slate with efficiency 5 haste2 golden pick axe....it is technically faster then diamonds right?
wonky walkway
name suggestion for the alley = The Galley,  1.G for Grian. 2. its an alley. 3. galley is a type of boat. (boatem....)
Technically no one has watched through the whole episode yet just remember that.
you could call the alley Horizont alley
The bank is called gringots I 🤔think
Grian: is near the boatem whole Everyone: Oh yeah,it's all coming together
what happened to timmy the magical pig?
at the end of the allyway build botem hq
G agon Ali or diewonk Ali
8:04 of course you are grian. of course you are
those two new buildings look like brother and sister
Name the ally diamond ally instead of diagon ally
“Grian Alley” should be the alleys name
It's not the waggon it's the SWAGGON
Pull the lever, Wonk!
grain
Call the alley the Galley (for obvious reasons) and maybe have a ship shaped building at the end
The dream slayer 👑
Hear me out, Diagon Gralley
Put your villager hall at the end of your cave I think that would work well
I haven’t seen the video yet, but after seeing the title all I have to say is is this the third or fourth time?
Griaaaannn. There's no small gaps between the buildings
This made my monday! Also I'm gonna go get 6 shulker boxes of deepslate just to have the *experience* (plus I need it for my build)
Just seeing you upload makes me smile
diagrian alley, just an idea
Scar is going to build a big cloud city
Grian: “We are *FLYING* in the diamond department. 15 minutes later: *-*dies-**
The Boatem hole is hungry... Feed it.
Grian name it the alleyway of angles
10:40 "Shag"
Grian! will you PLEASE stop losing everything!
Name the alleyway G street please
Ah yes beacon lag
Here is a good name for the alley: The Craxel
you can call the ally way in your base "wonky way"
As slow to get as logs, and no way to automate it outside of quarrying which is a gigantic effort
Great job Grian
griagon ally maybe for the ally's name
Caveagon alley
6.9 mil subs. Nice
CALL IT GIAGON GALLY!!!!!
You should make a diamond throne at the end of the hall!!!
Sub to beatly regime gaming boi please
the "scar build here!!!"alyway
Omg you should so call the Alley downtown alley 😂
Hes becoming more and more like scar thier battle will be legendary
"Oi scar build your shag here"   Me: *do they know what shag means
Grian, please, pleeeease. it's in-ven-tor-ree NOT in-ven-tree. i'm begging you, it kills me every time you say it.
Grian should build a bank at the end called griangotts CALLED IT!
Grian is going to be richer in this season than in last season
mumbo did steal it
Grian, Mumbo may not be the 1st to steal your beacon. But I must not snitch.
12:01 You're gonna regret that Mumbo
Yay new grian video
Griagon Alley
GRAIN IF U SEE THIS MESSAGE, build the bank and make it a villager trading hall.
Grian, you should call your alley, Boatem Boulevard. Not only does it have a nice bit of alliteration but it also makes a nod towards what started the gigabase.
"It lagged into my inventory"  I feel that will be a thing throughout this whole season.
love your video grian
Diagrian alley, must I say more?
how about calling the alley ; "The Valley Way"?
Griagon alley would be a good name IMO
Awww, Grian nooooo!
Why don’t you call it the Gally it’s like pun because it’s a part of a boat and Grian + ally idk it’s just a thought
OHHH GRIAN, to keep up with the theme of puns this season call the alley the Gallery or Galley way
I will be throughly disappointed if u dont add the leaky cauldron as a entrance to your base
instant karma lol
bruh moment
Not the last comment keep on scrolling
Is the big building at the back just gonna be filled with deadly meeting rooms?
Noice
griangots bank would be amazing
Grian "After 2 hours, I *only* have 6 shulker boxes of deepslate" Me: "You have 6 shulker boxes?"
Place your what here???? Scar????
Just name it Horizont Alley. It's the perfect name!
Something to note, you can't instamine deepslate even with efficiency 5 netherite pickaxe and haste 2. It would be nice if that was the one thing that could instamine deepslate
10k likes in 15 min lol HEHEHEHA!
episode 13, the unlucky number.
Alleyway suggestion...(I suck at names) Griant's Causeway...
Lol this is amazing not scar bahahahahaahahaha
Notice me   A building themed with season 6 base and 1 themed with season 7 base   Name for the alley : Galley
is it just me or does anybody else get emotional because of grians' time lapse music
Horizon Alley (horizontally )
grian needs to do a 12 hours mining for deepslate
I have an idea for the alleyway. You can call it the gally... g  alley😂 but the meaning of gally is actually to scare or give a fright so it would be cool to have the alley incorporate this somehow
Make a boatem theme park!
i've got another name for the alleyway it should be called hermagon alley
Is he building Sesame Street?
Last day of vacation and he uploads. Made my day
Scar bought someone's attic early on the season and now Grian is offering him a free attic
Grianalley
In writing this with the help of autocorrector soo here I go: I have no idea what I want for the next time I’m going back to the house and I just want to be able to get a nice deal of it and I just want to be able to get a deal on my own life so that I don’t want to lose it again because I’m going back to the house and I’ll be able to get a new job at work so I’m just going back to work for my boss I think 🧐 and I’ll have a half a new deal with this one ☝🏻 I’m going to get my own house in my own car so I’ll wget it back into it woriwiw I’ll just get my back up and I can just get my hair done I don’t wrong I the one that has a half I want a half inch so I can go back and forth with tomorrow I have to go back to work I have no idea how I can.                 K THIS WAS JUST NOT OK
"I'ts not about money, it's about sending a message."
7 mil grind
“Griagon Alley “ is looking pretty awesome IMO 👍
Why don’t you call it DiaGrain alley. Yes I meant Grain not Grian
Dang Grian was lagging hard
LAG
Uh...Grian...I know it was meant to say Swag, but whoever wrote that did not write Swag, or Shack 😂😂
Lets call allyway Frank
Grain-gotts bank of builds and stollen gunpowder!
Hi
Grain
The server is LAGGY today
The graly perhaps as a name
Shananigalley should be the name of the alleyway
How about Greangon Alley Greangotts
grian you should have the deep slate have stocks that go up and down like bitcoin
Grian now has 6.9 subscribers, nice 👌
Me seeing the title at first  "I thought I've already seen this" Reads agian  "oh.."

Grian should do a dark oak building in honour of the barge
Call the alley way this 👇  GRIALLEY WAY
YAAAAY HI GRIAN I HOPE YOUR HAVING A GOOD WEEK!😀
"If this isn't the most overengineered, over the top starter base, I don't know what it is" Scar's S7 starter base: Am I a joke to you?
Call the alley Greenstreet
I love how grian is like where not going to do a mega base                   He’s right he didn’t make a mega base they made a giga base
If you make diamonds mining deep slate, and can sell it isn't that stonks
It's probably a horrible idea and a bit late for this, but i thought it would be funny to call your base diagonally and make the buildings on a diagonal.
Where impulse put the sign is much better. sorry grian!
Grian, My love, you should call the alley "Griagon Alley".
Name the alley way gralley
what is your time lapse muse?
sending a message to scar me reacting in my head : s7 message system v2???
Cool vidio
I have an alley name idea: the galley because it is g like in grian. And alley. Kinda like the g alley. Or the gallery.
I think maybe you should call the alley horizont alley or vertic alley just like diagon alley is diagonally
You could make a bank at the back of the alley and call it Griangotts
Hey 👋
rip summer
“build your shag here” 💀
You could make a bus station lol, imagine a london tour bus on hermitcraft
Quick suggestion for a alley way name: Merigo Alley Way Pronounce as merry(like for Christmas) and then go
Griagon Alley
*Sees video title* DAMNIT GRIAN
Wonk
You should call the alley the “Gallery”
Diagon ally is called Diagon ally because its diagonal. So maybe Vertic ally
cool vid btw im an og been wachting since like ur webcam vids
You should call your base the Galley (Grian-alley)
The perfect amount of subscribers.
Dont blame me for your beacon disappearing. Its not very nice. (Read my name lol)
Grian, you should get a cat and name it Abraham Delacy Guiseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley, since that's the alley cat
"this is totally my beacon and emeralds" thats sus next he will say what sustainable
My request :- plz play and try minecraft pocke edition     Give me a heart plz...
Just seeing the notification for this being uploaded was amazing because now I know whats going on in hermitcraft on your side
You should call the alley mineacon alley
You could connect the giga base by using a “to move” product you could also use it to send messages
Grian: "Then were ganna build the build the big building here" Me: It BETTER be Griangotts
name it the dreamslayer ally
EYYYYYYY
Grian's video is like a painkiller for my life!!
grian why dont you just call your base griagon alley also why isnt the g train going into the cave?
After last season, grian got about a stack of diamond blocks, but on episode 13 of this season he got more than a stack of diamond blocks
Griagon Alley... I came up with that on the spot so I am mostlikely the first to sugest it.
Boat’emgone Alley? Yes, no?
Darn lag put grains items in the void
Da grian alley
Bruh you are so lazy for building so at this point you can just abandon it, and hire scar for diamonds from Grain. idk just do what you want to do, and dont lie to us about loving building things. just sell stuff and buy hermitcraft, you are good at such things
you should name the ally gally. ^_^ it's a combination of your name and ally and also sounds like gallery; which it's like a gallery of awesome buildings. ^_^ Makes since to me. lol
Grian is the unofficial 2nd member of the 2 brain cell gang
Remember when grian would do building tutorials? Like when a new update came out he'd go over tips and tricks
For the name of your base, you should go with "Horizont Alley" as a play on Diagon Alley
grian gringots more like graingots
Maybe you should call the alleyway  diagrian alley
Look how slow this is! Meanwhile me mining a whole vein of it... *with stone pickaxes!*
Why did i think it said scar, build your   shag here
The alley could be called “wonk alley”
Q: how long are you gunna do hermitcraft for
How about calling the valley, galleyvalley?
What's driving the G-Train?
@Grian Diyamond Alley is what you could call your alleyway! It is looking absolutely awesome! Keep making the amazing content!
Name for the alley Mine-agon alley
When your so early that nobody has even finished watching the video yet
I have a little idea, you can make a building a bit like gringotts wich can be your storage system!
10:44 do non British people not use the word shag?
Name for the Alleyway: Grialley Way It sounded better in my head
Alley Amily
I’ve got the name for the alley.   Diamond Alley. Diamond pronounced like Diagon  Bit of a pun there, since the gtrain makes so many diamonds
This base feels like a perfect time for a reference to your season 6 extremely tall base. Just a house stack type of thing(and maybe the dragon idk)
This is the scar build here war
Of course. Episode 13👻
Lag baby!!!
Names for alley ideas: Gralley  Grain way Wonk way  (sorry if somebody doesn't like these names I made them on the go)

The botem allye
Grian on season 9 should make a cargo plane
You should make a shopping centre as a place where people build there shop but make them pay a tax every so often to boatem incorporated
I think wonk might be my new favourite word
Diagonal alley
Griangotts! If you don’t name the big bank Griangotts some hermit’s gonna get hurt

Call the alley the “Gally” Grian + Alley 😏

Call it 'This is the (Ally)way'
you should call  the alley the galley "GALLEY"
A street with farms in the buildings……. I’m getting evo flashbacks

Allyways in your base would be quite cool
Scar's base will be a mountain and a cloud
The perfect chair doesn't ex-
Grian has 6,9 Million subs now LMAO.
Soo... Name for the Alley.. Voldemort Alley? Cause ngl.. Grian dosen't have a nose lol
You should call your build botum alley

Hi Grian, I can't watch right this moment, but I just wanted to say I love your videos, they really brighten my day, and I'm praying for you!❤
The building at the end of the alley should be “Griangotts” bank
Oh dear grian.
Wait did that sign say shag
You should call it the Gallyway
I wonder what's gonna happen in this video
Griagon ally or gigagon ally are ideas for the ally name
If Scar doesn’t settle on top of Grian’s Mountain, Grian should build Hogwarts on top of the mountain.
Call it griagon alley
Dia-grian Alley?
It’s a good day when Grian uploads.

Vertic alley
You can name the alley "Clifford Street", because of the cliff

Name suggestion for the alley:   *Straightforward Alley*
Grian’s bolts had too much wonk in MCC16

After I just lost everything whilst going to my enderman farm it feels good seeing other people lose everything

Just realised that grian now has 6.9m subs, NICE! ^^
Grian, you must see this *Boatem Alley*
Diamond block alley?
Maybe name it the charismatic cavern
You gotta call it the Galley
Only Scar and Grian can loose their stuff in one season so much.
Ok hear me out name for the alley: Wonky Alley
Was having a late night Ice Cream and saw this... ik i just had to watch it while eating
You should call ally minecon ally.
Just a quick idea for a base name, you could do a play on words and call it Griagon Alley 😁
I've got the BEST name for the alley.... DRUMS.... DIE-A-LOT-ALLEY
Random question Who In this comment section watched Dragon ball Z Abridged?
Scar build here   Grian Reply  here. ⬇️
I feel like I'm early but really I'm not
Tnt miner and pick up the deepslate?
:/
I'mma say this now the picture of the black building was gorgeous! ✨✨❤️
You could call the alley Di-Grian ally
Griagon alley
I have a name for the base Hermiton alley
im so early bro
Grian name the ally stone way or stonerock ally
Strange lag on the server today…
NAME YOUR BASE GRIA-GONE ALLY PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Silk Touch the deapslate diamonds and sell them for 5 diamonds each They look amazing
Grian should make Gringotts and call it Griangotts, this is the season of puns. And sell derpcoins cheaper maybe?
You should call your base Griagon Alley!
9:57 AmErican lAugh
Deep slate ally
The Deepslate may be hard to get but at least it'll make more diamonds than Odea. Odea was a waste of time.
You should name the alleyway "Galleyway"
Grins little laugh at 9:57 gives me life
I have a suggestion for a name for your base.  You should call it “Grianoally It’s the closest I could get for diagonally :)
you should ask impulse if you can place a part of your g-train in impulses garage
Why not name the Bank: "Griangots"?
Nobody is selling ancient debris yet and there's a fortune just sitting there waiting to be made. Get Mumbo and/or Impulse on making a giant mining machine in the nether and people will have to shop at Boatem for an exclusive valuable item.
Names For The Alley  Gralley (Mix of GRian And aLLEY) G-Alley(Sticking to the trend of g-train)
The Grian-way  Edit:The G-way
What's funny is almost every one else in boatem told scar to build above them so grian did nothing 😂
Grian call the alleyway ‘The Burrowed Bazaar’
69
Name it vertically
Call ur base hermit alley
Call the alley way Phil’s Alley. My friends are a couple and their names are Phill and Ally, so it’s a bit of a joke.
GRIAGON ALLEY!!! YOU GOTTA CALL IT THAT PLEASE
Lmao call it horizon alley. Or horizont alley
ez
Railway regulations say your deapslate wagon is not safe.
Grian: it’s so slow mining deepslate.  *Me mining deepslate with my efficiency II iron pick.
Grian you should call the giga base The Boatress (boatem fortress)
Scar's starter base will probably bigger than Grian's mountain by the time he's finished with all the wagons..
Just got the Notification      *I'm already 6 mins in*

People on hermit craft: I only got 6 shulker boxes  Me: 6 stacks ye that's enough
Diablock Alley?
Grain: this looks like a secret door Mr mumbobatpotatoewaynejumbo: this door looks so good that i want to have it in tinted glass so everyone can see it

Given the inspiration, I think Vertic Alley is a good name.
I’m telling ya, DiGrian Alley
Diagrian alley
The griagon alley
Are you going to have a "knockturn alley" part of your base? Maybe like a dark place you sell the heads of other hermits or something lol...
The video is out. Me: i need to write a comment
Name the alleyway; diagonal alley  How do you use semi-colons
GRIAGON ALLEY
Name idea griagon ally
Grian, Instead of 3 for 2 You should go like 12 for 8, or generally something in a bigger bulk, to encourage people to buy more, otherwise it's basically 1,5 diamond per 1, since nobody will only need 1 stack of a building block. (Maybe 13 for 8, or something, so they can't didvide the price themselfs)
Grian has 6.9M subs. Good for you G.
6.9 million subs huh nice
Grian you should name The Alley The backgone alley Makes no sense I know
"Today's Episode we're gonna send a message to Scar." me: Hears a rumbling the Mycelium is rising from the floor of Boatem.
Grian: I'm going to fill it like it's full of coal Also Grian: *puts deepslate on a flatbed with no security from any side of the flatbed*  You don't know how much that hurt me as a trainspotter
The alley should be called Griagon Alley
You should call the ally wonk ally
Btw if u get haste 2 and conduit power with an efficiency 5 netherite pick axe u can insta  Mine endstone and deepslate
Grian: I can’t say anything about backs of bases  Me: *has flashbacks to the season 7 mansion

just an idea for a name of your alley -> Grian o' alley
Woah finding diamonds by digging down geez
6.9M subs... noice
Idea to call the alley as verticalley
Grain for the middle of ur base put Mumbos office For botem As he is the ceo
Mirage alley
hs
The Squiggalley
Griagon ally NEEDS to be the name of your base
Grian says that you get to watch the video in a time lapses while he is diaing inside
Call it Ogre St.
The Gally Way
Grian should put a totem pole in the boatem hole
I’ve always thought it was laziness but it makes sense now. If you never put a back on your buildings all of your time is dedicated to making the side you see beautiful. Overall making you a better builder because you don’t have to spend half of your time on the backside. Grian you are a genius
6.9 million subscribers… *nice*
As soon as I saw the title - Losing everything (again) - I was like, ‘’Perhaps you perished?’’
Call it the Gally
Your lucky you have two little brain cells I don't have any 😂
You could name it "Griagon Alley"
grian collab with doni
Bdubs is selling deep slate
again seriously
7:50 grian, that creeper wanted to buy something but he had no arms, he cant get up the ladder and for that you KILLED HIM?! he was even walking up to you to ask for help to get up
Name idea for the ally: .Griagon ally  Not original in the slightest but here you go
I wish I could buy Deepslate from a shop on the SMP with me and my friends, I am building a huge base and have already used over a chest full of shulkers worth of Deepslate and am not even halfway there, I would love being able to spend my diamonds instead of mining all of that!
I think the alley should be called grain lane (Grain is intentional)
ok
Happy you went back to that stripped crimson log building design, I really liked it!
We will be sending a message. Mycelium resistance!
Diacave ally?
Cobbled Cavern ally
G-train get G-pain

Yay, new episode!
So, I will say thanks for the episode. I will just complain that it isn't a few minutes later, since I was planning to go sleep...
Grian you need to be careful no one else looses all of stuff as much as you lol
Scar doesnt want to build a mountain but like a city in the sky like that's in Bioshock Infinite
Meanwhile scar who is planning to build a cloud base
Build docm's tnt tunnel bore from season 7 and use that to collect deepslate
Grian the new tinted glass goes really well with sea lantern it emits less light ass we want for the inside of the harrportter street thingy ;_;

Can we all agree that Scars "starter base" is every normal minecrafters megabase
Grian you did amazing in the last MCC! can't wait for the next one
Grian, you should create some alleyways leading off the main street
Grian the big bank or something   Me… you mean gringots dude
do a diamound chandalier!
Oh
please try mod packs like rl craft
I now started watching all of the boatem members. Its so nice that there is now episodeja almost every evening.  The order i started watching. From first to last -mumbo -grian -scar -impulse -pearl
Anyone else gets really excited when he starts building the alleyway ? lol
Grian: "Losing everything (again) Also grian: What's another 17 more years,i can always start again,make another pick
wow
what is  the update on third life?? I watched it again and I miss it soooo much.
hi :D
Really…

Fun fact, no one have finished the video yet
your awesome congrats on 6,9 million subs XD

Hi :D
THIRD LIFE 2 !!!! PLEASE GRIAN
i dont think pear knew what shag meant when she made the message in the sky
Hi
Hello
Just on time I was about ready to breakdown
When 1.18 comes out you should build something underneath the boatem hole below bedrock like a big hanging llama or something! Also love your vids!
I’m literally stopped mining Deep slate in my world to watch Grian mike deep slate??
It’s been seven minutes and there is 1063 comments 27588 views 5.6k likes and 16 dislikes. Am i the only one who thinks this is absolutely insane?
Suggestion for how to make the outside of the base look for natural: make it flatter and more cliff like kind of like Mount Rushmore with the entrance where Roosevelt's head is,.
I read the title and IMMEDIATELY said "Goddamnit Grian" out loud-
Should be 3-4 diamonds a stack. If literally noone else will farm it then capitalise on that
I love how the video of scar reading the message came before the video that grian built the message
Congrats on getting runner-up in mcc16 grain much much luck for the next one 👍
Me when i see the titel: as per usual...
Hi
hi
I enjoy looking at 6.9 million subs
And you lost all your suff cos it is episode 13
You could probably hire mumbo to make a small deepslate quarry, tho it might be a bit pricey
G-Man!
The title worries me lol
Egg
Three min after!
Grian at the start of season 8 “this season I will build the back of my base”, Grian now “scar is gonna build the back of my base”
Don’t read this  You did read it and you didn’t come before 10minutes if you read this
Between yours and Mumbo’s base, there should be a lake leading into a cave.
16:44 losing everything
Last time I was this early, mumbo still killed stuff
I know it’s basic but instead of Gringotts bank it should be ingots bank? Lol
I wonder what will happen if Grian one day decides to build a circular base. Will it be a half circle?
Ello
6 minutes after upload, 27k views      what
Gigabase will be great
You go 6.9 mil subs
Not again…
Come ON GRIAN YOU ARE DESTROYING HISTORY.
Grian: Skar it's been over 12 episodes you still owe me a backside for my base
Very early🔥👀
Aww ship, here we go again.
Grian you should make the bank in the center of the street the boatem headquarters!
5 minutes and 871 (not including me) comments
Fun fact, u watched the whole video before you read this
Welp Grian upload right as the fire alarm went off so now I have something to do while I wait for whatever is happening to stop. Apparently it's not a drill which if I had known I would have grabbed something other than my phone and earbuds  Edit: 1 hour and still outside, I wish they would let us go home or something it's to hot to be standing around outside.
hi grian
Horizon(t)-alley ??

Let’s get grain to 7m

If you were to count how many times grian has died it would never end.
994th
Watching this while my brother is raging in my room.
Grian I mentioned this in your last video (I was just watching a really cool animation by Doctorsiren about NPC grian u may have seen it) but now I’m intrigued…where has he gone?
Those two emerald beacons in Grians base are very useful like Grian one was enough lol
I love how when you tubers go back to the basics they complain about how slow the mining and walking is. But, like, we do that as normal fastness. 🤨
Grian is the type of guy who risks it all and even goes for second like he lost everything (again)

Hey Grian quick question, what is your favorite block?
Grian 6.9 million subs your so close to 7 million also grain so offendce but when someone on the server loses items I feel like you had something to do with it all the time no hate to you tho I just find it funny
If only owls existed in Minecraft that would be great for the alley
0:01 YES ITS MINE ALL MINE
Oh no, not again :(. Anyway I love the gigabase idea and how the diagon-cavey (my idea for the diagon alley-cave name)
One of the 360 s
its been 5 minutes and thhere are 4.5K likes.. -_-
Unlucky losing mcc by a thread

I was here before 10 mins looking forward to da episode
Grian has 6.9 million subscribers nice
Put boatem headquarters at the end of the alleyway
6 minutes
I have a weird idea: maybe you can have the season 7 town hall In the middle
Just got my eyes dilated, can hardly see what’s going on, but still excited to listen to the shenanigans!
The 'big bank"
Build in the center of the ally barge hq or g train hq
For the giga base impulse base should be the place where everyone will craft and all of that good stuff mumbo the storage base your base because you have houses everyone should have a house to sleep have their loot,… and pearl should be the meeting base or extra storage
Grian please name the alley way the "WONK ALLEY
It's no longer The Boatem Hole, It's "The Consumer".
I think u missed the oppertunity by adding a s behind build
2:48 grian if you build a bank you should call it Griangots
Hi
Grian's message was pointless coz everyone else started building messages for Scar to build. Also Gruan asked Scar to build there to cover up some of the back. Lol
nothing makes a monday better is when grain uploads
when i see a video of grian pop up, my day is made!!
Here
This is pants
Hi Nice video
Like this video

Hi
Speed
every time grian uploads i drop everything and stop whatever im doing/watching to watch the vid.
Hello
guess what, ive seen scars vid, he overthinks it
I just realised There is no way boatem incorporated can fail   They have the owners of the most successful shops from season 6 (cherry: scar) and season 7 (The barge: Grain) on their side…  But they also have mumbo who made odea…   Oh dear
Thank you I’m home sick from heat sickness fun to watch
Mt. Scarmore returns to us!!
Maybe make some sub caves leading from your mane cave to add some secrate areas or something else
1:21 I knew I wasn't alone
deja vu
Yay I vid frame u always makes my dayyyyy!
6.9 million subs!! NEARLY 7m
POV: you commented before you watched the video knowing it would be a good one 😌
Ur ur
Hi Grian!
How can you manage to lose your items this much
Did you know that mumbo is Bruce whyn and he is the batman and you are? superman.. SuperG? And also don't tell anyone that mumbo is potatman
My heart goes out to the victims 😫👏
Damn how many hours?
FIRAT 5 MINUTES!
I've just had an evil thought, get yourself down to half a heart, dress up as a tree and position yourself so mumbo 'chops' you down, thus killing you and ending Peace, Love and Plants - I want to see if he then goes on a rampage to make up for lost time.
Press F to pay respect
Yo gribo I love yer vids but yehre bad at the redstone
Ayyyy
I'm watching this as soon as I could
Grian
i love you grian
me: oh it came out two minutes ago! I wonder if anyone has commented anything? also me 10 seconds later: HOW DID ANYONE EVEN FINNISH THIS IN TWO MINUTES ITS 22 MINUTES LONG
Wow I’m SUPER early for once
grain keep up the good vids!=)
Last Time I Watched Hermitcraft It Was Still On Season 5... Time Goes Fast Af
the luck these days: getting covid: 40-60 dying in minecraft: 60-40 falling out of the world: 1-99999999999999999999999999999999 what luck!

2nd!
*Happy Noises*
Hey
Banger
I watch HermitCraft and then wonder how he was the last one surviving on 3rd Life
There is already a competition from scar build here(everything what you begin it is going to be a warr now a scar build here warr😂)

If I had a nickel for every time that Grian lost everything in hermitcraft season 8, I’d have 2 nickels. Which isn’t much but its weird that it happened twice.
Approaching 7 million, my friend. Well done!
"Again!" 😐
Hi

I was just saying “awww man, Grian hasn’t uploaded yet 😔” and then you uploaded and I started to scream of happiness💕
Grain

Grian, I think your going to be making a lot of sales on your Perhaps You Perished Parcels.  But at the cost of your own diamonds.
Was just watching a vid, turned it off cause I saw this XD hope everyone who sees this (as well as those who don't) has a great day.

I've never dropped what I'm doing so fast for a notification

How to not lose stuff in minecraft           Dont die.
I've lost... but at what cost?
I am veryearly
Why people call grian grain ?
Love your vids

Great gontent
Why do you keep falling in the botem hole?
If i was Grian, i would have ragequitted the world the first time
Great gonten
i’ve read the title and now the whole episode i’ll just be thinking “when will the time come”
6.9 million subs nice
Its fresh from the oven
Hey didn’t you buy a roof what are you gonna do with it?
Me:reads title*  Me: oh god grian what have you done…
Hi
Let’s go new video :)
“Day” five of suggesting you should try and do some of the stuff they have in universal. Like how if u do something with your wand something magical happens using red stone. It could add some interaction to the build. :)
Hi
Again? Okay...
Omgomgomg you and mumbo uploaded same time basically omgomgomg
Grian: dies *just like the simulations*
Perfect I just watched Scott’s latest empire episode
Title: Losing everything Me: *First time?*
Not first but I'd consider it early
I wake up and see a grian video couldn’t be any day better than this
Scars starter base is what I would call a mega base, or at least it would have been before I found out what hermitcraft was a few years ago
Thanks Grian! Awesome  content as always. Keep it up!
Pog
Lmao look at grians sub count
It's always a good day when Grian uploads.🙂

yay i’m so glad another video is out
U gotta see 7:34
O
i was just saying i needed a grain video and 2 minute later , here it is xD
It would be cool if all or a lot of the hermits worked on creating a system that connects each hermits base that can send items across bases using the nether it would maybe have like a hermit throws in a paper with the name of the hermit they want to deliver their items to and at their portal it would have item sorters that will determine what name went in and then it would activate pistons and such on the item transport trail allowing items thrown into their portal where they send and receive items and it get sent to the hermits base they chose and it would go into a chest at their base. Probably would use chunk loaders in nether. Also they would have a special portal at each base that they send and receive items in that attaches to the transport trail. This way hermits can easily send items to other hermits but not have to go to their base if they are far away.
too easy
Hi

I was just looking at this channel because I was like hey we haven't gotten a Grain episode in awhile
hello there
Thanks Grian, I am in hospital, after heart attack, just seeing the notification made my day ❤️   Edit: thanks everyone for all those sweat messages. It wasn't actually heart attack, but more likely epileptic seizure. I was in unconsciousness for 3-5 minutes. Thankfully I was resuicstitated quickly, currently doing absolutely fine without future aftermath  Also apologizes for my English
Oh no not again
Hello Grian
Woo!
Im early!
Hii
Hello im early (again)
Lets goo didnt expect a video from grian but im so glad you uploaded!!
Grian should make a rail going around the server and also make little stations where it stops for a minute or 2 before the minecart keeps going and it has really good deals so the hermits will wait around the server for the chest in minecart
