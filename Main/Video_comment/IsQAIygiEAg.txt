Bro still hasn't learned how to use the mouse to control the camera 💀
LARRY I SWEAR TO GOD I WAS JUST PLAYING MM2 with you pls tell it was you with long lashes and pink skin plsss tell me it was you
I started at 8 years old hearing your music
Ofc we were going “this ain’t a race but u still take first place” at a young age it’s apart of our culttt
I agree with you Larray, I'm a survivor of online dating from ROBLOX and now I'm 23 and I've stopped ROBLOX because it's not fun anymore. It's traumatizing to go back and play on it, yet I am more aware of the issue with online dating and now know the signs of a predator. I was 16 years old and this man was 18 years old who claimed to be Autistic and he used to be in a public school in the 4th grade as an ADULT. I totally believed it because I wanted to see the good in people, which some people do when they are being groomed unfortunately. His mother even made it believable, so I thought it was real. He was then put on online school, I guess it was too much for him(it was a lie). My grandparents knew about this and didn't really care which I guess, they were naive just like me.   However, it came to a point where they turned me into a hypochondriac and I believed my grandparents were not taking me seriously about my concerns(as usual), but it turned out to be complete BS. They claimed my symptoms were probably a large ovarian cyst and it was going to rupture so I should go to the ER. My grandma talked to the mother on Skype, but my grandma told me, she's crazy, don't listen to her but I didn't  believe her. They didn't force me to run away at all, but they tried to call police on me because I felt suicidal and CPS was involved. Yeah, I was still convinced at the time and confused so I asked my grandparents to take me to the mental hospital and they did. It took a while to go back to normal, but the psychiatrist was concerned my hydrocephalus(water on the brain) was returning so I needed to see the neurosurgeon. I was scared to leave, but I was convinced to go.   Later on, when I got discharged I realized what they were doing to me was dangerous and I called them out on it. They told me that they knew I was doing this for attention and that my aunt was right about me(she never said a word about me). The truth is, I was not doing this for attention at all and they knew they were going to get caught. They were mad they couldn't take me away and my social security disability income and kidnap me probably. I got in so much trouble with my grandparents because I could've been brainwashed again, I assume but it was for my own good.   Anyways, I don't know if they were caught by police but the police officer at school looked up the man who lured me on ROBLOX but didn't say he would do anything about it. I hope this story teaches someone to be careful and to WATCH YOUR CHILDREN MORE. Don't ever let your children give out their address like my grandparents did for any gifts or letters.
i was 7 when I listened to it😭😭i was obsessed
I’m only nine and I know the whole song and I was singing it so much and the way I pissed my friends off

2:42 BOY YOU HAD ME AT 8 YRS OLD WYM
To anyone reading this: God loves you more than you could ever imagine. Don't turn away from Him.  Romans 5:8-10; "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life."
I’m 10 and I’m still listening to you

3:06 BITCH WYM LAST TIME
2:03 ISSA I HOPE
I hate how he always has to bring feminism into everything.  Like that's good that you care about womans rights and all. But it dose not have to be  in every sentence. You don't need to include feminism into everything to be a feminist. Also who stands up for men? Nobody. Larray makes it seem like women can do no wrong and that everything should be blamed on men.
Genuinely can't stress enough just how much I adore and appreciate you because a bitch been thruuuu it recently and u really just pop up when we need you most lala 😭😭🫶🏽
Keep Carti forever girly♾️♾️♾️
Congrats btw
You raised us 😀😍
