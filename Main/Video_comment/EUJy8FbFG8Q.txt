At least he did the right thing and resigned! Not like the Democrats, who just circle the wagons along with their buddies and cronies in the media and news channel 5!
Good job Phil. You make me appreciate the importance of local tv.
Doesn’t change anything about the TN 3. All this reporter does is slam Republicans. This guy is trash but this reporter is so biased!
Why are these idiots elected maga?
"Consensual adult conversation"  😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅🤣🤣
Here’s another one!!!😱☹️🫣
The republican party has no shame
I’m glad he’s gone. Separate from this situation I still think the Tennessee 3 are ridiculous, race-baiting, fake grandstanders. Both situations are terrible.
you lecherous disgustng jerk, I hope she can prove some of this, as in; recorded his vulgar remarks to this 19 year old young lady.He probably HAS kids the same age and he knows better than to say crap like that to any intern at anytime.  No she never said yes you can say vulgar things to me....does he think we're all idiots or that all us women haven't gad to deal wqith creepy pererts like him all our liuves in one form or another, every place we have ever worked?
Geeze- big surprise  Individual Dems fk up too  this 😎 is beyond me…. He wanted to have a relationship with a teen? Call BS
All republicans idiots
This is a disturbingly familiar pattern:  a GOP pervert criticizes a more liberal colleague for their politics, whilst engaging in more egregious offenses. "He didn't think he did anything wrong." That explains a lot...
The Honorable El Hajj Malik el Shabazz said the masa wont come for you. He will send those like you from his house. Out to fields to do his biddin. Beware to Nastyville.  He also said the white liberal is the greatest deceiver of blk people and use them as political pawns in a white power end game.  Dont take the bait. For 70 years Democrats have been the figurehead of blk politics and have reduced them to a paltry and stagnant population rate of only 14pct.  Before the open borders Latinos were 17 pct. If youre not following GOP principles all that time you should see how your Democrat principles have betrayed you...
Well it is the GOP after all..
Scum!
How disgusting.
Dose this surprise any one
What a fucking creep. And the GOP allowed him carte blanche behavior of being a creep. Sickening.
No one should EVER be surprised by this. It's been happening since before this place was a country, it's called white male privilege. The less power the victims had the more they were abused. Just know there are many more just like him all over the place, but shhhh, it's a 'secret.'
birds of a feather. you need to look at his friends. like donald, like rudy, like jeffery,  like jim jordan... birds of a feather. if they are supporting trump after this sexual assault case, they are a bird with the same feathers. don't kid yourself.
Why Else Would The Republican Party Be Fighting To Make Laws So They can Marry 9 Year Olds ? So They Can't Be Held Accountable For Rape.
It doesn't matter if it was consensual. She was a subordinate and a teenager.
Could'nt of  happened to a better good old boy.  😤
Ah yes, the party of God, morality and true blue : the GOP.
Sounds like a setup.
What a liar, hes trying to excuse an assault as normal talking.
Great investigative journalism. I ask who votes for these sleaze bags. As for the GOP leadership who took no action to sanction this creep, but expelled those supporting gun control well it speaks volumes. The hypocrisy is palpable. Gross.
GET EM'!
So how many days does breaking news take to get to my feed. New stuff in 9 days.
Beautiful news reporters
Bahahaha! Conversations??? Now that’s a new way to put it! Bahahahaha! There is not enough liquor in this country that would get me drunk enough to perform anything on that little runt! Haha!
Cute black and white dress. But clip the bra straps together in the back!
This mf. He seems to think if he repeats the word "consensual" that it makes it so. And legit how did they not expel him.  Wth.
Wow, what a turn around. These people deserve being charged.
Can't they afford desks? 😸
Anyone notice a pattern of sexual harassment with these hillbillies?  But decorum.....right?
If you need a policy to not act creepy & you don’t know the difference you could be a danger to society!
🎉🎉 is what the republicans want under the radar
But this is what the Democrats want to teach our children in school with genderqueer and drag queen story hour. Why is it okay to sexualize children but appalling when it's an adult.? And this has nothing to do with the Tennessee three who participated in an insurrection.
C R E E P!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬
Dude needs 5 seconds to catch his breath. Glad he's out.
Republicans are KKK, rapist or wanna be slave owners.  They killed America.
About what we’ve come to expect from the GOP “leadership”. 🤡
Take his goddmn guns away for good measure
Shame on the double standards…GOP = Grand Ol Perv
What a loser!
This is the morality of the GOP.  Been proven over and over.   How repulsive.
Bunch of hypocrites.  No surprise there.
What would make a fathead like him pink a nineteen-year-old won't his ugly
Some one need to check ted Cruz for sexual harassment
Two totally different events,  democrat new channel
There is an old saying. Then you digging  a hole for someone make sure you dig one for yourself
The republican party is a hypocritical party. But whatever you do in the dark will come to light.
Ain't payback HELL!?? YOU WILL REAP WHAT YOU SOW! LIVING IN A GLASS HOUSE AND THROWING STONES! HOW STUPID CAN YOU GET! GOD IS GOOD 👍😊 TRUST HIM AND NOT MAN ♂️🤣.
That sorry, racist, lying freak. Who would want to be with him anyway? A foolish GOP Politician. Just like the self righteous Pharisees in the Bible days. See, what happens when you sow evil, you reap it. He seems to be a lying coward.
Lock him up but you won't cause he might tell on the rest of y'all l'm just saying y'all have a good day
why so much perversion?
Redneck IDIOTS! PUT HIM IN PRISON FOR ME,ME,ME AZZHOLES! JERKOFF! THAT'S ALL AMERICA!
Imagine how the young lady must have felt working in that type of toxic environment with this sexual predator near her. I really hope she's safe, that's all that matters to me 🙏🏿. He has no remorse, because he believes what he did was alright.
*Suprised Pikachu Face*
SURPRISE SURPRISE
The GOP: The gift that keeps on giving.
Republicans corruption at its finest.
😂😂😂 Shame
Biblical....Gal 6: 7-9..."A man reaps what he sows." Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up” (Galatians 6:7–9).Feb 28, 2023
WOWWWWW And it was done in private,  behind closed doors ? And no reprocessing by the other members who obviously knew about it. But the black guys bring in a microphone and they get placed on TRIAL ? THIS IS AN OUTRAGEEEEEE AND SHOWS HOW F@$KN RACIST THESE S C U M BAGS ARE
Let them all fall hard and drop like a sac of potatoes
Good grief
Good
Racist overweight  sexual harassing  dopey  Sounds about rethuglican  Oh obviously greedy  and delusional
Now the speaker needs to resign
19 years old...consensual adult, or 21? Either way, it was swept under the rug. He still stood on his behavior wasn't wrong and the expulsions were justified.
How is a 19 yr old an adult??? She's still a TEENAGER.....NINE-TEEN.....PERIODT.
Thank you for shining the light on this guy's amoral sensibility.
No ethics this who represent but you have to look at the people who elect these type of no IQ 3rd  grade educated farmers.
East Tn? Pretty full of himself- better take care of his own business….
Pass the jowl bacon, Bubba.
Great job confronting him!!
The nerve they have, the privilege,  thee audacity....the protection they get, the secret hearings....quick to ex us out with your own closet full of demons smh
Buh bye another Republican sexual harassment case!!
That's called karma
Bye Felicia
Dig dig dig. You should dig into all of their lives all those Republicans slugs
Good Christian MTG. Cheating on her husband. Hypocrites.
Not surprised.  Just another hypocrite repub. Slug. This party is frigging evil.
That was wrong what he did. No company puts up with sexual harassment.
It is not a Republi an or Democrat problem. It is a Human and moral issue. It has not to do with a damn party affiliate. Woe to you Scribes, Pharasee's Hypocrites.
Fucken hypocrisy! All a bunch of liars and garbage people.
Sexual hypocrite
Karma karma.
What a evil liar
Deer in headlights see the look on his face when he told him that he's guilty he know that you two was in there performing sex acts I'm sick people I'm telling you
Banana Republican party are all Traitor's and criminal's Trump and his supporters are all Traitor's and MGT Lauren boebert Matt Gates Scott Perry Lindsey Graham Kevin McCarthy Ron Johnson Josh Hawley George Santos Donald Trump'and his son's Mark Meadows indictments are coming for you clowns just like Tucker Carlson he got fired from his job for telling lies all those lies how embarrassing is that Fox news clowns basket of deplorables people who are hateful pathetic individuals evil people basket of deplorables people who are criminal
That guy is a complete weirdo.
This reporter should win an award for his interview lol
Don't say gay laws people, getting turned on by same sex sexual activities, as long as they are females.
Wow wonder how Marsha Blackburn thinks about once again another republican sexual harassment charge. She might want to clean her own doorstep before telling more lies she spewed.this person is lying and he knows it just look at him when they ask him questions.
when the  biggest republican  boss of women harassment and rape demand all his subordinates to follow and bow to him...what do you expect ?
These are the sick lying idiots that we have as representatives in congress that shouldn’t be there anyway or anymore .
It’s crazy how this dude is continuing to say that he just had “consensual conversations with adults” even after the investigation started. Once he paused to take a sip of water I knew he was gonna start spewing absolute BS- lordt. 😩
This isn't the first time a member has had an affair with an intern. How does this have anything to do with expelling the 3 members that became protestors ?
What stupid piece of crap!  Hope he gets put in jail. Fresh meat!!
Ha! The Republican party is the new Trump admin! Everyday theres something nefarious going on & everything they accuse the left if doing ir being...seems to be their very own confessions. Its sickening!
I had consensual…con..sensual…sensual…sensual….uhhhhh, give me a few minutes to sip my coffee while I try to figure out how to bull$hit my way out of this…. Liar liar!
So consent is i say yes and she is uncomfortable? Wtf? Bruh... and sexual harassment isnt ok just because you didnt do it at work.
Wht are so many supposedly surprised? They're all hypocrites
Plot twist is real
GOP Scum, what did you expect?
Congrats News 5....one of the best investigative reports I've watched in ages...!!  Uncovering the secrecy, hypocrisy and eventual financial cost to taxpayers.  Keep up the great work, America needs you now more than ever...
Wow he is a good liar! A great example of republican leadership!
Another Republican bits the dust. Republicans being themselves.
They don't like women with power and try to bring them down.
Why do rats always think they are holy than thou he a freak that’s what dirt balls do lie he a pervert, but he’s Judge mental towards the.three people he tryed to oust hypocrite
Fucking hypocrite!
Why is it that only GOP members are caught up in these types of scandals? You don’t ever hear a democrat being charged with any sexual misconduct or assault
look at that schmuck Republican lying
Great Reporting
🤢🤮
Pack of liars and cheats! I hope they get what’s coming to them!
Look no further than the GOP for all of the baby rapists and baby eating vampires. ☠️💀🤣🤣
I admire your calm direct delivery. Thank you for reporting a very awkward situation tastefully and being direct.
This is the most unsurprising thing I’ve seen all morning. Racism and sexism from the same person?? Unheard of!! 🙄 I’m so tired of these pundits and politicians proving me right.
Karma comes quick these days!
He is responsible for any damages . How can anyone who employs someone not know his behavior is wrong.
Any relation to Channel 5 News? Lol. This is good "on-the-ground" investigative reporting here also!
REVEAL AND EXPOSE ALL OF THE REPUBLICANS ALL OF THESE RACIST REPUBLICAN  POLITICIANS FATHER GOD EVERYTIME THEY GO AFTER A BLACK PEOPLE UNFAIRLY IN JESUS' NAME AMEN.
What a creep.
How do people vote for a person like him? Is it just because he has a “R” after his name? What does it say about them whom do so as a person?🤔
Yet another example of how extreme gerrymandering results in unchecked power of the least worthy. With a balance of power, comes transparency and accountability.
Doesn't it just figure.
Good work, just looks like two consenting men having an awkward conversation about one grubby man and one poor girl having another awkward conversation 😳
Just a great all-around good Christian values kind of guy. Give the guy a break he's just being a regular lying sexually assaulting Republican, makes you wonder how many little boys & girls he's touched.
The 3 legislators did nothing wrong. Evidently Campbell doesn't hold himself by the same standards as he does to people of color. Kudos to the investigatory team for fleshing out this predator.
What is it with GOP and sex?
Now get rid of more GOP members
Hey look! It’s another amalgamated smegma in the ranks of the GOP!
Typical slimy Republicans.
Tax-payers have to pay for it buy we won’t know the full story even though this is  non- government business involving a public citizen and now non-government employee? Must be nice to be to get a free pass.
Could this guy Campbell be any more full of shit?
One of the few GOP legislators who accepted and owned their sexual advances.
Nothing but a sick f@ck.
SWEET EMBARRASMENT! may this one arrogant KKK lawmakers repent!!!
Absolutely disgusting and repugnant! What a LARGE LOAD OF OBESE HOF SHIT! The hypocrisy is real! 💯 what a fckn 🤡
Typical GOP monster. 🦨
I already think unpaid internship is already slavery.  She wasn't his peers, she was a subordinate, a hostage to his perverse advances and a victim to a predator.
Hmmmmmmmmm... where is the surprise?
Consensual one-way conversation is what it was.
When you spit into the wind it flys back in your face...😂 If they hadn't expelled the T3 this LIER would still be in the Tennessee state congress
Karma!
And you know he's a Conservative Christian!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Those people don't believe in God or Jesus , they never did , these are the same people as their fathers, grandfathers and great grandfathers who hung black folk one day and sung hymns the next day, These so called Christians who love Jesus, Are the biggest Hypocrites in the whole wide world!
VOTE BLUE ONCE MORE IN NOVEMBER 2024!!!
They always say we are investigating cant. Comment on that and how is it not public knowledge its Taxpayers Money they are spending covering this up this long and now really should be investigating investigating the Right Way The People have a right ro know how much MONEY its cost💥 🤬  Watch Them Close✊🏼
Great reporting Channel 5
Creepy
When you are a politician you are always on the clock buddy... you should have been professional at all times unless you were with your family and child hood friends
He was nervous as hell!😂😂😂😂
Damnnn can't believe they the Republicans finally took action against 1of their gooood but don't stop there keep going.
Look at this hypocrisy.  This racist bum voted to remove 3 members for protesting on behalf of children while he was trying to sleep with children.
A certified guilty scumbag.
That's always the case.. Those that are seeking to correct others.  The corrupt Christian Conservatives,  that would like others to believe that they can do no wrong. Usually, they are more corrupt and rotten all round.. Have they not read in the 2nd epistle of Romans verse 3 Be careful when condemning others, less they condemn themselves and that those who indulge in such a practice will not escape the judgment of GOD.. Let them carry on, they'll just have to learn it the hard way..
While plenty of Democrats were involved with Epstein, his sweeetheart deal and the now protecting the names of his wealthy clients is being done  by Republicans.  I have come to believe the reason so many repubs are against abortion has little to do with a child's life and more about having more poor children to put into foster care and trafficking
The gop house speaker doesn't live in his district.  And has bee stealing cash.
"Why didn't republican leaders act more decisively?" Gee..by golly gosh...that's a total mystery to me.
Sorry Dude that’s not how it works and if you’re claiming ignorance to what is actually classified as sexual harassment then you’re too stupid to hold office.  The interns acceptance of sexual innuendos does not give you free license to interject your flavor of freak into her atmosphere at will.  It doesn’t matter what piece of real estate you’re standing in or what time of day it is you disgusting idiot!
Yeah he gets to resign, WHITE PPL …….🤦🏼‍♀️
When thinking about republicans one word always get to the front of the line - PROJECTION
Every accusation is a confession from these vermin
Jail this sex maniac😊
Notice how the Republican lies so easily!
KARMA COMING 4 THEM ALL
Yikes!
Amazing!!!!! This is journalism!
Ol' boy was probably all jacked up on alcohol,😅 Trying to perfect his playa game.  Lol
These christians are the worse of the worse. Pure filth.
Wow! Wow!clean up you back yard, you nincompoop. You sex molester. Shame on you
That dudes a pervert. A big one. What comes around, goes around.
Throw his ASS out... NOW!
God don't like ugly 👍 what a Wacko Goofball
This is why people need to make sure nothing in these Politicians Political work is ever kept secret from all the Constituents who vote these Politicians into office and they must keep their word!  No Secret Meetings Ever!
😂🤣😂
There is so much disgusting EVIL in the GOP.  Time to clean HOUSE.... & SENATE. 2024 VOTE them OUT.
Text book example of white privilege.
Republicans, who's not surprised?? What is wrong with the GOP, what's wrong with the voters? Do you hate that much? SMH😢
This guy couldn't maintain a consensual relationship with a mosquito
Look at him, he is not looking to sexy ,right!
When will men stop lying about us just because *WE WERE NOT INTERESTED*  Maybe grow up and start to wrap your head around the fact that if we are interested, you'll know it. It is not 1905 anymore. We don't say no and secretly mean yes. No, thanks I'm not interested, *MEANS EXACTLY THAT* Take it like a man and keep our names out of your mouth
With the GQP there is always something worse with them!
"..another satisfying racial moment."
He has half a brain.  Stop voting for these people.
The ethics committee found him guilty.  So much they had to get the girl out of her lease and put her up into an expensive hotel that taxpayers have to pay for.  He's lucky the intern isn't talking to the media. Probably because she wants to keep her internship. Funny how he calls sexual harrassment a mutual conversation between friends.  The ethics committee didn't believe that so why should we?  Glad he resigned!

What a scumbag creep with his BS excuses! I hope he's miserable & ashamed.
The gop is pathetic.. they rules are for thee but not for me. These men are misogynistic fake Christian evangelicals human garbage. What happened to all their transparency.
honestly why is it that all the lawmakers and congressman that are pedophiles rapist sexual deviants  are all Republicans
Typical Chump supporter. He had a beautiful conversation with the intern. So beautiful that it was perfect! LOL
How sad to take advantage of young people your own united state so rapist killers all types in government and they running states doing this bs how sad why don't they get rid of them all put some people with no felonies that would be if it was us regular folks doing what they have been privileged
The groomers and the pedophiles have always been the  members of Taliban loving insurrectionist Vladimir Putin ass kissing Republican party .
Hooray! it's about time these devils are exposed.  More need their filth exposed.
Garbage in, Garbage out.
weird how he tilts his head  juts his chin forward, then pulls it back   he thinks he looks tough. haha. 😮😂
American need to clearly understand that you give no government full power...the police should never have total power... congress shouldn't have total power.. when you give total control to one are the other, you can be 100% sure they will abuse it. just look at the house with republican in total control... when you give people 100% control of anything they will see that as their right to do you wrong
All the rethugligans, repedophiles, reracists, rehomophobes, rechildmarrying freaks, will have to answer to all the bones falling out of their stinking closets
Girl whatttttt? Just nasty, he probably the one that peed on the house floor..... Perp walk him no leniency
Based on my experience associating with several  politicians, behind closed doors many of them are like this. They drink too much and act like straight up pervs. The married ones are even worst. Oh btw, it doesn’t matter what party they are apart of either. So when an intern or any woman speaks up and points it out, believe them.
Good that he resigned.
Both parties need to go Republican and Democratic
Wow you just can't make this stuff up! Their hypocrisy knows no bounds!!
So perverted. So glad that his sins found him out.
Doesn't surprise me...
Of course he was... Lol
BUSTED, now you lie from both sides of your mouth as this is what you all DO And Why do You all claim its the Democrats with the freaky inmoral actions, when its most of the GOP You have to love that there isnt any accountability, wouldnt that be called BLATANT HYPOCRISY.
What a pig!
You vote to and ultimately expel three people for adhering to their first right amendments!!!!!! But then you DO NOT GET CENSURED or EXPELLED for sexually harassing multiple women.  SMH!!!  hy·poc·ri·sy [həˈpäkrəsē] NOUN the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform; pretense:
You FIRED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So...This MF'er voted to oust lawmakers for passionately fighting gun violence as the voice of their district but was reprimanded for sexually harassing interns and is allowed to resign? Ok 🤷🏾‍♂️
.....But rules and laws are for "those people"  not us Republicans!
Man you'll be ok just think they loved Bill Clinton
What BS !! Does he ask them can I ask you uncomfortable sexual questions? Is that how they consent to a consensual adult conversation when he puts his hands on them?
Y'all mfrs are not as smart as you think you are this stuff is funny
They have no shame....
Fantastic reporting! Hold public officials accountable.
Glad this slimy hypocrite is out, but how does someone guilty of sexual harassment just keep their job like nothing happened? In my gov't job, the administration at least conspired to lie about the incident, but that wasn't the case here. Regardless, thanks to your investigative staff! Job well done!
Bye boy, boy bye! Have we learned any lessons yet? Expel the truth it comes back, lie and get exposed and kicked out. Republican politics are the politics of hate, fear, the politics of grievance and complaint, the politic of hypocrisy and anger. Abandon conservative principles bc they are the false, they are lies and misdirection and misinformation. Truth requires no support, only lies, that's what Faux Fux not news is based on.
Wow! Just WOW! The depths of depravity on the right, is astounding! Makes me sick to listen to him trying to excuse his disgusting behavior. Makes me more sick that the other members didn’t expel him or any other members for their disgusting actions as quickly as they did the TN 3 for breaking decorum. Just proves how awful the right truly is. 😠
When did vulgar sexual behavior become illegal in Tennessee?
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  Also, this guy just assumes all conversations are consensual? What a gross guy.
You quit when your transgressions became public. Nuff said.
I swear it seems like the GOP's only solution to the real pedophiles, groomers and rapists are to turn a blind eye to their existence within their ranks while concocting rhetorical scenarios from the left.  How about addressing ACTUAL monsters out there instead of buck passing to nonexistent platitudes?🤔🤔🤔
Living in a Glass House, don’t throw no stones!  Karma never forgets an address and she’s not so pretty when she walks on your street!!!  He shout be removed!!!
Republicans are disgusting, dangerous, corrupt and dishonest.
The Tennessee GOP is clearly corrupt.
Such a disgusting human being, yuck 🤮
Covered for the guy until he was finally found guilty. Yea, that GQP is some kind of political party.
The FBI need to investigate all of them and computers
Coffee or whiskey in that red mug. My guess alcohol. Most likely drinking while committing he's perverted acts to young woman.
That white woman ain't lying on you
Why did it take them so long to expel him.  He should have been out of there.  Racist are hypocrites
He wasn’t expelled? No means NO. It’s not consensual when you keep pushing on and on after someone says No dummy!
Typical RepubliCON behavior! The rules apply to everyone else except themselves.
No telling how many other Women this Scrub has treated the same way. He obviously can't talk to a lady like a Man should. # PATHETIC
How sad is it that I am not at all surprised. Great reporting, keep digging!
Not only is it hypocritical in the extreme, they did the ethics investigation in secrecy. Also, Campbell is a very creepy, pervy person. Kudos on the reporting.
Campbell needs to exert some of that energy on roadwork !  A regular running routine, perhaps with the right diet, shake off 70 pounds.
I'm trying to act surprised. But, I just can't. 😑
Waiting to hear the financial cost of what it cost to "fix" his consensual conversion?  Bet it isn't his 1st time!
They were ur coworkers dummy.
This happens often in politics and work environments. Many women don't report this behavior because of fear. The fear of death. Many politicians are thugs and drugs users. Ex page Boy in the 70's
Good he should have been resigned sorry pos
He's a fool.
This is typical of a republican. They will never admit they are wrong. And still is on a high horse when it came to the Tennessee 3, go figure.
He’s done!! Creep!! Get him outta there. Jail time🤬
The real story is the channel 5 reporter. He's one of the oddest guys I've ever seen on the news, but he also feels like one of those rare, genuine investigators. He's not there to play around and look pretty. He's cutting right through to the facts.
The privilege👹
P...O...S
Another trump supporter, no morals, liar, racist
Being a Republican is an embarrassment. Liars, pedophiles, no values, no morals...the disgusting bunch!
Ain't that bitch!!!
He sounds like he's about to weep in that video.  Accountability has the same effect as onions.
Excellent coverage!  This is why we need REAL journalists!  Great job, Phil
The hypocrisy of Republicans knows no bounds; The Dems violated the "decorum" (peacefully protesting gun violence) but sexually harassing interns are NOT grounds for expulsion? The republican party is nothing but a $hit show with all these MAGA idiots. Trailer Park $hit Show!!!
GOP!!!!!again
HE LOOKS LIKE A PREDATOR...LIKE TRUMP AN GATZE
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE SURPRISED  ???  IF  YA ALL AINT NOTICED ITS ALWAYS SITTING SEDITIOUS TREASONOUS SCUM REPUBLICANS...
Your a pervert.....nasty bastard
But don't forget the Hunter Biden's laptop story 😂
An example of the immoral, deviant, ineffectual kind of reps in that party! REPUKE’LAKINS that would strip the military that protects their lives, family lives and American lives…grow up and accept responsibility …or tax yourselves for a change!
Look at that piece of lump!!! I’m sure there are lots of women who find him attractive! He gets women all the time!
Conservatives/Fundamentalists are sexually repressed, and live in a toxic patriarchal way of life. This is why this is so common with them.
If he's telling  truth he was set up
Just like his daddy trump
KARMA 😂😂😂😂
Boyeee white folk SOMETHING ELSEEEEEEEE! … the hipocrisy 😮
These evil republicans think they are above the laws and they will protect each other’s evil criminals deeds this is a very dangerous evil party 👿👿👿👿👿
I'm honestly surprised he talked to the reporter at all...
This is how Maga Republicans  think. They preach to everybody else about  family values that they don't even follow. Even though this Republican legislator is a perverted piece of 💩, in he's mind, the rules don't apply to him, just to everybody else. The radical right are a bunch of fn hypocrites. What's really funny is the qanon nuts claim that they are advocates fighting against child sexual abuse while they elect sexual perverts like this guy to lead their party. (Donald Trump included ) SMFH
That guy is a joke.
Great investigating
Despicable!
Not surprised, just appalled
Unfortunately, I am not surprised this happened.  I will say that the devil is not your friend and what is in the dark will come to the light.  Be careful on what you choose in life because it can come back to bite you in the behind.  He has learned today that if he would have done better and made better decisions in his life/work, he would not be in this situation.
Why is this not everywhere in the media!!?
You are always beautiful Whimsy, inside and out. Ugly comments only come from people who really have hangups and low self esteem. It reminds me of the saying: Some people cut off other people's heads so they can appear tall. Thanks for sharing your wonderful gifts with us. You are so accurate. God bless.🙏🙏🙏
That's called Karma Sir!!!
Tennessee backwards inbred🤬🤬🤬🤬
Creep😂😂😂😂
Bye Felicia
He's creepy too.
Ahhh The party of morals and Family Values aka The GOP!! Ya gotta love em!!🤣😆🤣😆
Happy for the good outcome.
Decency! We already know the GOP has none.
Geez! What a slimeball. So glad you exposed this sloth and forced a resignation🤨
Typical Republican, if they're not raping them, they're harassing them, ask DJT.
Nicely done reporters!!!! Job well fucking done!!
They eventually get their consequences.
Badah badah badah thats all folks. Just the beginning. They're bringing this all on themselves. Evil doers.
Holyshit!!!  Doesn't that just figure
I appreciate Channel 5 bringing out the trash in Tennessee.  This is pure corruption. Bill Lee is also corrupt. We need change!!
A repugnican pig
🟦
Guilty!
Look At God...Lord, please continue exposing all of these hypocrites. They need to remember when you point a finger, 2 or 3 are pointing back at you.
A GOP member accused of sexual harassment of not one but two interns.  Lmao 😂😂
Did this Really surprise anyone?
Republicans are nothing but low life SEX PREDATORS
Sick
He’ll just go home and play kiddie porn.
The hypocrite resigned due his vulgarity towards young ladies.
incel.
The republican party needs to be dismantled and destroyed
Warmt 725 k SANTODOMINGO
WHY CAN'T PEOPLE JUST BEHAVE???!!! WTF!!!
Another corrupt republican gone, this country just might survive
MAGA (Majorly Antichrist Genetic Americans!)
Republican party is a cult ! They are very fake people that pretend to be good people
Oh but aren’t democrats pedos? These republicans are a JOKE. Lol bye career bc you’re a disgusting PIG.
All Of Those GOP'S Only Concerned About Their Own Personal Agenda, To Keep America In The Gutter.
O MY  God 😂😂
Good work you guys.
The GOP lawmakers are morons and hypocrites of the highest level. Why didn't they vote to expel this criminal? Why didn't they vote for criminal fraudster trump's impeachment? I wonder if this were Obama, Biden or even George W 😳😳. 45 has been found guilty of so many crimes but are willing to go down the deepest pit with him 😳😳. They defend a criminal but won't defend the defenseless innocent children and other innocent American against gun violence 😮. They are all a disgrace and an embarrassment to America, humanity and democracy.
GOP is always dirty
If you want your president, Congress and local officials picked by Qanon, the Christian Taliban, Nazis and cult members vote republican.   If you want your government picked by rational, intelligent human beings VOTE DEMOCRAT!!!
NOW SEE..... ...GOTTA BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU YOUR OWN SKELTONS ARE RATTLING LIKE HELL BEHIND THE CLOSET DOORS...yeeeesh........
What’s done in the dark……..   the Republican pot always calling the kettle black.  Go figure.  Disgusting hypocrites!
Good Ol Pals.  This is familiar and accepted conduct by privileged white men all over the country.  Sick!
The Hypocrisy of this group of legislators.
You mean to tell me the GoP was sooooo concerned about "eThIc vIOlAtIons" that they ignored one of their own for sexually harrassing an intern and even allowed him to stay and vote to kick out the Democrats?  Every Republican accusation is an admission of guilt
According to Campbell, he "Dindu Nuffin"
MAGATS are not nice people.
So, taxpayers fund is a secret? I'd love to know what they are spending it on. Some people really need to learn how to vote. Then, this guy wants to know which camera he needs to look at? No shame at all and says: "I didn't do anything wrong". Oh, for goodness sake...
Typical Tennessee chud.
It just goes to show you that whoever is pointing a finger over sexual misconduct is doing the same s*** themselves
Scotty Campbell coming off like a perverted loser.
Great job
One size fits all when they tell you they are republican , SCUM!.
Karma doesn't forget your address.
Karma 😂
This Republican is the best example of the poor  character and poor morals of many elected  Republican leaders.
Nasty sleazeball pig
Wow ! WM wtf is your problem ! We know who you are and what ur capable of ! The more I hear the more I HATE I'M DISGUSTED and  SICKENED  I FEEL ! 2023 WHITE MEN ARE THE 'N's of America !
What they meant for evil, God made it for good. The rest of those devils need be careful
So we are now calling sexual harassment, consentual adult conversations?  How convenient for the Republicans.🙄
WOW, what a complete scumbag. Seriously should never be in charge of anything. He should know that claiming ignorance about something doesn't make you innocent.
DEUCES ✌️
GOP 💩💩
Sexual harassment and pedophilia is rampant in the republican party.
Not enough just to allow them to quite go to jail just think another ted, GUY , we can not ALLOW bad behavior any more. FORCE THEIR power on their workers. Molester, teen sex, game how much each sex conquest is worth,  not taking action on behalf of students.
It’s amazing… you have 2 idealistic views on accountability. When Black and Brown people stand up for themselves, Conservatives are quick to deny any and all rights of protection and due process. Demonizing groups of people to flex their political and authoritarian muscles. But when their behavior and actions are in question, it’s a matter of technicality. No denial of the violation or crime, but deflections, whataboutisms and technicalities. Then themselves are the victims to an unjust and unfair treatment. It’s amazing to watch.
How many situations of sexual impropriety are we going to endure after finding out the Republican Party knows, but did nothing until the media finds out?
He gave self righteous speeches against the Big 3 Democrats. The irony!
Wow, he wasn’t voted out? Those Republicans are so upstanding
Why was this not investigated by the judicial branch?  The police and the court system should be involved.
Yet another Republican pervert.  What a surprise...
What a shameful, bigoted, backward hypocrite.
Double standard always
This is why I have such deep contempt for those espousing conservative values. It is completely, wholly and comprehensively disingenuous dripping in hypocrisy. As a living breathing human being, the fact is we are sexual beings with drives and predilections that are hard-wired in our DNA. Then these people come along, with the sanctimonious holier than thou vacuous baseless values of uprightedness - that is always misguided and paper-thin in its moral value that they try and force down the throat of everyone whilst being absolutely incapable of upholding those standards. I have zero respect, patience or tolerance for this.
Anyone who voted to expel needs to go.
This won't mean one single thing to a GOP supporter pretty sad.
Just pure garbage.
Justice doesn't always come when you want it but if you keep fighting the bad guys you eventually win.
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮 he’s disgusting.
Disgusting ignorant Republicans don't again?
It’s weird to see good reporting wow!
Hope the Justin’s remind these holier than thou folk just who their party is every single day.
And she accepted a downtown apartment from this man
That's the crazy thing. Most of these members' hands are unclean. Their unethical and are quick to throw others under the bus even though their doing unethical things.
Oh my god! 😮 These are the people who talk about morals and try to tell people how to live morally?! Seriously?!!! Pigs! Predators to women! Forcing women to have babies! These are the people attacking women’s rights! They want control over women!
This is the problem with people. The sit a judge you. But have a closet full of skeletons leaning against the door, ready to bust out. So you need to think about that before you go judging others. Because you will get your turn to be judged. Sooner or later.
CARMA 😅
WHY. WOULD. HE. DO. THIS. ?  I. SMELL. A. RAT. HIW. BOUT. BIDWN. SNIFFING. AND. PUT. HIS. HAND. WHERE. THEY. DONT. BELONG. HOWEVER. I. THINK. THIS. HAS. ANOTHER. PURPOSE. AND. IF. YOU. THINK. ABOUT. IT. YOU. MIGHT. COME. TO. ANOTHER. CONCLUSION. !!
Shame!!!! The shame of it
The zoomers are so admirable they are reporting, spreading, and getting shit done better than Biden 😂
Justice is sooo sweet.
And they let him walk, thats the white way of doing things.
Great job exposing this P.O.S.
Lol, GOP at its best!
There is nothing as convincing as a resignation to prove you are innocent
Thank you for having a straight-forward interview with him and calling him out thank God he resigned afterwards because that is hypocrisy at its height! But what do you expect from a chauvinistic pig
Hypocrisy at it's finest¡  🤡💩🚮⚖️
You’re stupid/Misogynistic idiot. she reported you Because she was disgusted and grossed out and creeped out by your conversation with her .what part of that don’t you understand bottom feeder creep🤮
They didn’t seem to think he violated the legislator. These Republican officials are disgusting. Subordinates should be protected. Kuddos to the investigators.
When you're dig a hole for someone else dig your own dig !!!!!
Tara Read was on Joe Bidens staff, she says he assaulted her. I believe her!
Interesting 🤔 they kept that quiet.
Mentioning two unrelated subjects in a headline is pretty revealing bias.
HE IS A CRIMINAL LIAR IMMORAL AND WE CAN SEE HEIS A LIAR AS TRUMP RAPIST
Another a-moral sick republican.  No surprise there.
Doesn't "decorum" mean the behavior of Congressional members no matter where they are?
...do you still want to vote Republican...?
It figures.
Yeah, but, but, but...he's not black!
Funny these guys knew  about this behavior before yet let remain in office
Well well well
not surprising
LOL Racist resigns.
Why is it so many Republicans are caught in sex scandals?  why are they always the ones endangering people in bathrooms, being found offering drugs to teens in seedy motels, and doing other innappropriate things?  and yet they say Trans people and Drag queens are the dangers.  STFU.
he seems impressed with himself, proud even, i wonder if he will have to be on the national sexual predator register
Am NOT surprised at all, it seems to be a requirement to be a republiKKKan politician if you ask me; racist, misogynistic AND sexual predator is part of the "job application"...The thing that will never fit into my big head is that voters keep supporting these horrible human beings...
Great investigative journalism and interviewing. Well done.
Well, looky here. Did he get caught for something that is actually a crime? Perhaps he can take his show on the road complete with an entourage that includes Dumbnold and Tucker. Tucker is  seeking employment.
The whole GOP are hypocrites!! They knew he was under investigation and didn't do anything about his position😒
Shocker….not.
White old men are dirty- they control their wives with bullshit. Many of them are involved in porn. They hate Black people & it’s sad.
She needs to have him arrested for putting his hand around her neck! What a psycho!
"I did not know that a workplace policy could be enforced when you're not at work."  Sure.  Sure.  Because she wasn't a co-worker, right? I mean after 5 O'clock she wasnt a co-worker anymore...  🤔🤣
It's great that TN has been the whipping boy for the past few weeks...but when are we gonna hear about some of the legislators in other freak states...like FL, and AR, and TX, and ID...I'm gonna need taller boots.
The obsession of some of our Republican men with sexuality is mind boggling. Yet they look across the aisle and accuse pretty much everyone there of what they are guilty of.
Wow...yet another weak man in charge of sh!t that he should not be in charge of...like other people's lives. This dummy thinks that there will be a next time that he will talk with young interns.
So these stupid Tennessee GOPers thought they would disenfranchise these two Black kids, and all they really accomplished was to shoot their profile to the national stage. In addition, they brought upon themselves national attention to all the corruption and abuse of power they have been engaging in the state.
Time to ban all white men from holding public offices. And also 200 feet away from schools  😂😂  The GOP party of white men is infested with sex offenders , homos, and pedophiles …..😂 But at least we have churches .  Oh wait . Fck…. These have white cosplaying as priests ……!! We see screwed …. !!!! No pun intended .
Why would the expenses involved be confidential?  It's taxpayer's money and this has nothing to do with national/state/municipal security.
Just don't call him deplorable.
Karma is a B**ch 😂😂
Just after trumps own heart
GOP Reprobate Silver Jeremiah 6:30 no mercy forgive them not thanks Jesus Christ hallelujah praise ELOAH amen 🙏.
Y'all. Did I just hear him say (paraphrased) 'I knew I wasn't allowed to sexually harass anyone but I didn't think it applied outside of work!" ?  (yes, yes I did.)
Republican no doubt Christian practicing business as usual.
Bingo
Another Dirty Hypocrite Republican White Male 🤮 Lock this Pig Up & Lose the key🤮
Great job Channel 5!  I wonder why that hideous whale thinks that two attractive nineteen year old girls (who essentially work FOR him) are his friends? If they were polite to you and didn’t slap your fat face over your perverted comments was because they are your subordinates.
Really, is anybody surprised at the sheer hypocrisy? Or the constant attention-diversion tactics? Or the audaciously self-righteous condemnation & judgement of others by people who are simultaneously hiding & covering up the sins & skeletons packed into their own back-room closets? Oh yes - here is just another shining example of a member of the self-titled party of morality & family values!?  These are the arrogant & highly self-righteous charlatans, liars & fools who sit on their rickety high-horses & believe they have the right, the superiority  & the special God-given authority to preach, judge, criticise, lecture, debase, hate-on & control others! WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THIS EXPOSED, TOXIC, RANCID, DANGEROUS & FASCIST NEST OF VERMIN FOLKS! THEY & THEIR BLASPHEMOUSLY-WORSHIPPED FALSE-IDOL PROPHET ARE 100% RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE HATRED, DIVISION, VIOLENCE, DOWNFALL & DAMAGE THAT HAS BESET AMERICA & AMERICANS FOR 7 YEARS TOO LONG ALREADY! THEY HAVE EXPOSED THEIR FAKE IDENTITIES, THEIR CROOKED & CRIMINAL ACTIONS, THEIR TOTAL LACK OF DECENCY, TRUSTWORTHINESS, MORALITY & CREDIBILITY; & MOST DESPICABLE & DANGEROUS OF ALL - THEY HAVE REPEATEDLY TOLD & SPELT OUT FOR US QUITE CLEARLY THEIR FASCIST 'HANDMAID'S TALE' OWN-GOAL AGENDA OF WHAT THEY WANT & WISH FOR AMERICA'S FUTURE IF THEY EVER GET THE POWER TO IMPLEMENT & ENFORCE IT! AMERICA HAS TO VERY CLEARLY & CONCISELY TELL THESE MAGGOTS THEIR INCOMPETENT SERVICE IS NO LONGER REQUIRED - EVER! VOTE BLUE FOR SANITY, REASON, RIGHTS, FREEDOMS & FOR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY TO CONTINUE STRONGLY & UNABATED! AND JUST TO GET RID OF THE SCUM!!
He will get off no accountability
Harassment of interns should be punished by a quick knife to the lower extremity
Big surprise.
He dug a hole for them, and he fell in the damn hole. Nasty man.
Karma bites hard and deep.
🤬His GOP colleagues knew about this. Yet took no disciplinary action, nothing, zero, nada. Racist chauvinistic, hypocritical, fascist pigs is what they are 🤬
Scumbag hypocrite. These ppl are not moral. Not even close!
Gross pos
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha Another Republican family values moron down the tubes hahahahahahahahahahaha
Color me shocked with the hypocrisy on the right.....pathetic! They only 'do the right thing' when they are caught red-handed.
Phil Williams is a genius. What a voice,
MAGA politicians are constantly projecting their depravity with every regressive piece of legislation they pass while doing exactly what they purportedly find Un-Christian and morally wrong. Smh
Pervert
Wanted to toss the interns "Salad"  especially named  "Scotty ! " Hypocrite Gay Basher carrying a huge Dildo in his huge bag plus a vibrating butt plug  😵‍💫🤯🥴😘🖕
Lol wow KARMA😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅  did he loose his words or mind!!!!
Ohhh dear, karma is such a BITCH... it's taking all white supremacists one by one... NEXT... LOL
They never of him to expel three in Tennessee and two are African Americans when he committed a crime himself. He belong behind bars for sexual harassment.
The GOP hypocrisy and cowardice is incredible and deplorable. Dirty, rotten SOBs.
lolol
This is Republican moral values.
The white Tennessee Republicans would rather expel two black democrat's wanting more gun control  , then a Republican little girl diddler from the Tennessee House.
Yep, the party of family values, huh? Despicable!
I didn't know work policies were enforced outside of work.   Puhlease!!!  Really,  you don't think you've done wrong discussing sexual topics with a 19 year old when you're (???) significantly older AND in a position of power (that's a problem even if she were the same age).  Don't know about him but I was very clear that if my behavior was inappropriate with a coworker outside of work,  I could still be fired.   How is it some politicians seem to believe that's not true for them?
Everybody is getting fired today!  Whose next?
NEVER reward a Republican with your vote.
Conservatives need to be super careful when they accuse others of of sexual misconduct. Or any misconduct WHAT-SO-EVER. They (mostly the males) are the worst when it comes to sexual harassment, pedophilia, prostitute use, rape, etc... Or better yet, don't be careful, my joy at their demise is epic.
I have already been told and taught that if you go after someone, you had better make sure that you are so clean that no one can come after you.  He failed.  This guy sounds like someone we all know that always blames everyone but himself for his actions.  Number 45 come to lite?
Corrupt GQP covering one of their own . No surprise here
Good
So not surprising
KARMA!!!! STOP MESSING WITH GOD'S CHILDREN..
He's a perv!
19!?!😮
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha !
Republicans are the biggest liars in politics.
We can’t trust him around our elementary students. He is prejudice and thought he wasn’t going to be seen.
Lock 🔒 him 👆 up 👆
Their falling like dominoes 😂😂
The same one who says “There’s lots of ways people can die” As he defends keeping assault weapons
Why is it men who sexually harass always say it’s a lie.  Own your mess, pervert.
Look what God will do when you mess with his children. You is done jokers
Lmao
I wish I could be shocked at the audacity and hypocrisy here. But I'm not, because sexual abuse is par for the course with fascists like this. Of course he's more offended by Black lawmakers' decorum than mindful of legislative interns' boundaries. Typical.
Lol he doesn’t think what he did is a crime and since he wasn’t in the workplace, there should be no repercussions. What a piece of trash.
Par for the course for the GOP.
Sick dog pervert.
What a shocker .... such hypocrisy
" That is not true " then he gulped!! He is lying 🤥.
Embarrassed! Embarrassing! Pervert, Creepy, I'm glade he's gone!
Perverted piece of racists trash and then going to try the r word her next look at him he's  guilty
Did he need a sip before responding 🤣🤣🤣.
Reichwing politician & sexual predator or sexual abuser is so damn common, like...is ANYBODY surprised???
Wth he got in that cup?!?🤣🤣
Charge him! He just said the court was lying!
Eventually, You reap what you sow!
Party of pervs.  Hey Margie...who's the pervs?
This is why journalism should be supported and well funded. Thank you.
Consensual conversation?????????????? Can we say Pervert?
So typical 🙄
See. You can illegally perscribe drugs, sexually harrass someone, beat up your family but all is good in Tennessee as long as you white. But a Negro practicing his 1st Amendment? No no no.Damn those animals
So, no criminal actions - the TN house votes to expel Actual criminal behavior *and actually being found guilty* - they give the guy an option to "resign".  Note - He didn't resign until *AFTER* the committee found him guilty. SMH
Trumplican contagion...
I’m so proud of my Representation from the gentlemen in Tennessee.  I’m grateful for the Bull Connor wannabes for amplifying the voices of these brilliant young men across the country and the world.   While I was livid at the multiple acts of bigotry we have witnessed for over a decade, I am grateful. “This little light of mine” is shining on and on.  Let it be and NEVER stop shining the light on their bigotry. NEVER!!!!!
WELL WELL WELLLLLLL, GOT HIS ASS!!!
These Republicans are despicable pigs.
Its nice that KARMAdoesnt need your address. Stop throwing rocks from your glass house Mr. Campbell.  Stop lying.
Yes
I'm not saying democrats are angels and completely innocent, but facts are facts. Republicans OVERWHELMINGLY get caught up in these type of scandals much more than their Democratic party colleagues. However, I have to hand it to this Rep for standing up and answering questions from the reporters. Most people just walk away with their tail between their legs.
He needs to be charged
Typical racist repub pervert. They are inferior to humans.
not being expelled for something like this is crazy.  Those 3 stood with their constituents. This guy did this for personal reasons
That's what we have in Texas. Paxton broke the law and is scott free
I love this reporter... He got him right on together
Excellent!!!
Another GOP legislator found guilty of sexual crimes
Makes sense. All you richys really think every woman wants you. Especially these redumplican idiots. Yall think this even when your a dirty poor.
He will probably end up working with trump or some other magga fool
Great journalism!
Ohhh sshhiiiiit
He's a Good Ole SLIMEBALL...
Keep OUTTING THE TRUTH!! 😊❤. SICKOS!!! CONSEQUENCES 😮😊😮
Teens no less, subordinates to him
Republican politicians and the Religious Right need to mind their own business! Corruption,  religious ignorances, conspiracy theories and bigotry are out of control lawless bullshit! Treasonous , cowardly, Republicans investigating the investigators stinks! Jordon, Kennedy, Chip Boy, Comer, Marge Tay Greens angry, vindictive, white privilege mentality is offensive and ignorant irresponsible behavior! Rafael Felitio Cruz is out if control Republican corruption, as well as Supreme Court justices Alito and his three stooges and both Thomas's! WTF!
How disgusting! What a perv! And a hypocrite! How dare he compare peaceful protest about gun violence in our schools to his violating rules about inappropriate behavior towards interns. Just gross. This women should sue him!
They are just self centred scum.
Good investigating
I'm sure he's not the only one sweating profusely now.
Well looky looky they hide his dirt and vote to kick out the good people.He can't talk
You goo get them.
Payback is a bitch.
May God continue to expose and judge those who whisper in secret vile and wicked plots. May they be snared in their own traps. And their secrets becshouted from tge rooftops. Amen so be it !
It reminds me of a man in the bible named Mordecai who was favored by God and was being harassed and mistreated by a man named Haman. Haman even went so far as to build the gallows for him to be hung on but it turns out Mordecai had previously saved the king's life and found favor in his sight, so when the king found out Haman was trying to harm Mordecai the king ordered for Haman to be hung and his ten sons on the very instrument he made for someone else.
I’m not a local, so I don’t know local coverage for anything, but Phil Williams is a freakin’ TREASURE 👏
At least this Gop has a sense to resign from this scandal. But what about Swalwel sexually relationship with Chinese Spy did he RESIGN? OH I FORGOT BEC HES demoncrats.....
Republicans. The moral party😒Those conservatives have more scandals with the men in the party. 😂😂😂🤡The more they are extreme on their beliefs I guarantee you they are living a hypocrisy lifestyle😒😂😂
😮 Ugh, The GOP is awful.  In South Dakota the GOP voted to stop feeding kids free lunches and 10 days later voted to have breakfast, lunch and dinners paid  to them as a right.  They are so messed up !
He sure loves to use the term "consensual", doesn't he?
I AM BACK           PLEASE    PLEASE       PLEASE       TELL US HOW HE WAS IMAGINING THEM HAVEING     GROWN-UP SLEEP OVER               WITCH HAND DID HE USE TO IMAGINE       WHAT WAS GOING ON           HAY PAL DO YOUR JOB   AND KEEP YOUR IMAGINATION              TO YOUR SELF
Republican party is a Sham!!!!! From local to National. 😢😢😢

BIG KARMA
You didn't motherfuker admit to it you think you're above the law f****** Republican
The initial obvious stalling is him trying to come up something that sounds innocent. He didn't go a good job of that did he? BUSTED! It is high time all the rocks are upturned so the terrible creatures underneath are exposed and crushed.
Allegations are the same as a conviction if you belong to the wrong political party, as usual.
Daaaaaaamn Scottie...  🤔🤷‍♂️ Thoughts and prayers mf'er... LMFAOOO 😂😆🤣😂😆🤣
It's usually the GOP!
😂😅😂 What goes around comes around. You Reap what you Sow.
I LOVE IT when Karma serves up some Justice.....
Poor kids that Boar pestering them .
That doesn't sound consensual, it sounds creepy.
A serial sexual harasser would have stayed in power if he hasn't been found guilty meanwhile 2 black men speak out about gun violence and they get expelled from office very publicly
Abusing power. Disgusting. Women of all ages should feel safe around coworkers esp ppl with higher authority
I told you the Republican Party are full of criminals period
Bye PIG!!!!!
Attention middle-aged paunchy dudes in power: college aged women most likely think you are 20 years older than your actual age and have no shortage of hunky college dudes to chose from.
Republicans are taking Trumps behavior as the call of the day….”if he gets away with it, so will I” attitude.
Gee, who'd a Thunk? A Sexual Predator in the Republican party 😡
Perverted racist unethical tainted bitchboy
Cause they resign that don't mean  They should get away with no charge for their actions.
Oh what a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive
I need five seconds.
Karma. Karma karma.
Here comes the defamation law suit for calling this woman a liar. Liars and hypocrites the lot of these men.
What a lovely ol’ human being he is. 🤢 May he wave his confeder@te flag in the flames of perdition.
Who would sleep with a loard ass like that ...
All the videos of Scotty on the legislative floor, he’s got the same red insulated cup that he NEEDED to take a sip from BEFORE answering questions; what’s in the cup Scotty? 🤔
Common citizen will be in jail. At least some jail time.  Not like it was consensual
Why does he think any woman would want him??? Especially a 19 yr old! PERVERT!!!!!
Why was it secret? Wasn't he the one mentioning God? And Issac 10 was noted.
Get prepared to vote! Vote for integrity and intelligence.
Good.
Thats disgusting.
Another day another repubs another sexual scandal what about hunter lol
They walk with their dirty ass feet pointing fingers at everyone else's feet, while they try to actively hide the mountains of dirt between their toes
All I have to say is "White Men" smh. This is literally the story of white people.
Another GOP (gang of pedophiles) goes down
😅😅😅😅😅 next phedo
It’s what they’re all about this sick pos want those black men gone fighting for justice and he fighting to sleep with interns
Eats too much pork
But somehow Campbell is the victim of the "woke" mob.  LOL
He's not that impressive. It was an abuse of his position.
this is why GQP politicians are so rabid with their grooming accusations. They are DESPERATE not to get caught.
Remarkable, isn't it, how an overwhelming majority of sleazy people are Republican.
😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everyone of em: out
Is there a member of the GOP anywhere in the country that doesn't sexually harass, grope, grab their pu**y, or even worse?
Give this idiot a piss test now
Wow. Child porn on children. Now this
He lives by the sword, die by the sword
What a sleazy scumbag puke
Do these people ever stop lying? They are just all so fucked up
At least the reporters kept their feet to the fire and got the just outcome. Now, why are the procedures secret in the first place????
The man is physically out of shape….he’s not attractive to women so he takes advantage because of his position…….sounds like the ex president…..when you rich you can just grab them kiss them do whatever you want.
Wonderful!!
Karma will get you every time.
😂Karma.
Hahaha, keep it up Republicans!
And he still is trying to deflect any responsibility for his revolting behaviour!
Typical Republican hypocrisy... it's totally OK to sexually harass women but not OK to protest gun deaths.
Grab by the neck is assault and she didn't call the police.
Why is the expenditure of taxpayers' money confidential???
Little Scott, got busted and everyone must be aware that the bigot brigade was trying to cover it up.
There went white privilege. There couldn’t be consensual anything with that guy 😮
Grand Old Projection? Grand Old Perverts? 😂
I am not surprise about her accusations. A lot of, we, women have gone thru the same & don’t report it cuz the flack that it would create. Men have accused women of being hormonal for eons but who’s the aggressor in all these cases⁉️ You don’t see women physically forcing themselves on men.😡
The GOP,oh we believe that woman are meant to be our playthings,just like our dear orange pervert leader,isn’t that what it says in the Handmaids Tale,oops I mean the Bible,🤢🤮🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️
I don't understand how anything that takes taxpayer money can be allowed to be confidential?
Just curious, What’s this man’s voting record on cannabis?
What is it with Repubs & Sex⁉️
Good morning Sir!  We're here for to find out why you're taking all the intern college Vaginas 😳😂 Well Sir your definitely on the Predators list now do you have a comment?  It was consensual conversation until I start talking juicy 😁
Karma bites back... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now when is Sexton going to resign after not living in his district, spending (stealing) money that belonged to the state?
She should definitely sue the guy.
Sick guy.  Why do all Republicans have weird sexual fantasies.
young girls, any grown man talking to u about sex, put him in his place immediately. put your pinky in his face and tell him to suck eggs.  and u better mean it.  don't let these clowns play with your non-experience. that's what older men do to young girls, EVERYWHERE.  so toughen up and stop it in its tracks. don't borrow crap from them, don't talk anything u don't want to be taken out of content. and sex is never a good topic to talk to a perv about. if u give a man an inch he will take a yard. meaning don't give him anything to play with. and i am so serious about this. young girls, young girls.
The 90's goatee should be a dead giveaway that this dude is going to be a sexual harasser.
He is a coward wait until his children and wife face this terrible action. His relatives should stand against him.
Great news
He grabbed her neck???!!! He's done many  times before to be this comfortable with his behavior.
Stop saying you had a consensual conversation. None of those girls said "hey piggly wiggly let's talk about my sexual history So that's not consensual. They didn't open the door you did, therefore you don't get to say it was consensual.
Always watch the one throwing the mud....
Nice how he gets to resign but 3 minorities in the same chamber gets expulsion votes
They wrote the house rules of the decorum... what about the rules of the decorum in the workplace that says don't sexually harass people you nasty piglet.
Wow this crazy!! Update pls
Filthy minds! When these people jump to conclusions about harmless acts by others, it is all coming from that pool of filth.
Nasty beast... Why would anybody have to tell an adult person when/if you're crossing the line. You know the difference between professional and unprofessional. Once a person tells you that they feel uncomfortable, leave that person alone. Furthermore you just don't let certain things come out of your mouth. The arrogance behind the way that this man is talking and the fact that he tried to use his position to expel those people so that no one would find out what he did, tells me that EVERYTHING these girls are saying is the truth.
Scummy old man
GOP: Gromrz Offndrz P d o z  Going after drag queens is a diversion tactic so Republicans can carry on with their deviant behaviors. Don't forget Madison Cawthorn exposed the Republican sex parties.  Excellent reporting Mr. Williams 👏👏👏👏👏
It's amazing how many pedophiles and sexual predators in the government turn out to be Republicans huh ? But yet Marjorie Taylor Greene goes around calling Democrats pedophiles and saying that we're grooming children while Republican politicians are trying to date them
GOOD GUY = investigative reporter. Brave, ethical, stands up for the young women and confronts the  sexual assaultant (who was already found guilty by his peers). Deals with it face to face in public (no weapons, just the truth in his words). That's a man!
Their brains obviously haven't grasped the fact that they cannot speak to anyone in a sexual manner. They have "consensual" conversations. First I've heard it called that. Sorry that his family are subject to his man's ego.
Times are changing and even politicians need to start going to jail for this democracy to survive for our democracy to continue to thrive people need to start going to jail for their crimes there is no immunities I don't care you're a government official you don't have protections that keep you on the job all this shit needs to be challenged and changed dead ass this is why shits in crazy mode cause people who supposed to be going to jail are not going to jail Congress men and women who win against the vote it's in the Constitution it's automatic removal congressmen and women who are supporting insurrectionists it's in the Constitution it's automatic removal this isn't up for debate this isn't a discussion it is literally the rules that need to be followed like right now I got to go into my job because I was taken off the schedule for two days because of manager wanted to walk around the restaurant saying I'm killing him and then he pulls me off to the side after an hour later gives two horrible ass excuses a pizza table and talking about a break like WTF how is that me killing you cause you just said I'm killing you I don't do it's a figure of speech that's what a black man says when he's getting his fixated by a cop you're killing me that's what a pregnant mother said when she was getting stabbed 15 * you're killing me that's what a homeless man who was getting choked out and pistol-whipped his head busted open set to the cop you're killing me some words you just can't use period
If you resign does that mean u can get away with it
Great direct questions from the news person.  Trying to get to the truth…. 👏. Bravo
The audacity of these right wing hypocrites! How the hell do they live with themselves. Every time you see a Republican accusing someone of something expect that  idiot to be projecting on to someone what he or she is doing.
😂😂😂 you can't make this shit up
What a piece of Poop!
SICK  - GOP!!!
New leaders are needed now
Time to grow up, "Scotty". No such thing as consensual sexual harassment.
"SHAME" GETTING RID OF THOSE 3 RADICAL LUNITICS WAS "THE RIGHT MOVE". Their not Representatives, Their Radical Marxist Lunitics!!!!!!!!!!! !!!
"SHAME" GETTING RID OF THOSE 3 RADICAL LUNITICS WAS "THE RIGHT MOVE". Their not Representatives, Their Radical Marxist Lunitics!!!!!!!!!!! !!!
"SHAME" GETTING RID OF THOSE 3 RADICAL LUNITICS WAS "THE RIGHT MOVE". Their not Representatives, Their Radical Marxist Lunitics!!!!!!!!!!! !!!
More American political republican corruption. People better wake up they are snatching rights like its open season. The last time I checked elected officials were just that, elected. Somehow they forget that they work for the people. This country is falling fast and if things don't change the future isn't looking bright at all.
A good start at getting these disgusting people out of office.  Now, let's get the gop seditionists out of Congress & deal with the SCOTUS liars & crooks.
Let me guess... Its a political witch hunt perpetrated by Democrats. What a gross looking hypocrite.
Wooow. Abuse of power !??
Please Investigate 😮
This is the party of TRUMP
GOD HAS. THE POWER ALL things happens according to his WILL
Wow, and look at that... he's not even black. I bet if he was, everyone would be flipping out that he was "set up" and screaming about racism.
What a creep!!! These guys think because they hold these positions they can get away with anything. Get this garbage out of political office - they will not be making any decisions that are to your benefit.
lol, are we really surprised?
Our representatives need to be held to much higher standards.
Karma is a bitch and she bites.
Well, they`ve certainly lost a brilliant political mind there
Good thing Democrats never sexually harass anyone (cough: bill clinton)
GM GOOOOOD JOB. MAN THE REBUBLICAN PARTY IS SICK LOL AND THEY HAVE NO SHAME BUT THEY WILL BLAME THE DEMOCRATS. LOL
Ban him from political office permanently
Karma is a b*tch!!😅😂
I hope the woman sues him for calling her a liar on camera.  I'm guessing taxpayers want to know exactly what it cost.  Confidentiality be damned.   An audit should be started immediately.  Makes one wonder how many other "confidential" payments have been made at the expense of taxpayers!
That's not true.  Hard swallow
All the swamp bottom feeder are now leaving building.  Everyone running. I'm enjoying this part but we don't have time we need to fix issues of our Country.
Nice to see a woman is believed for once💯💯💯
Good riddance pervert🎯🎯🎯
Haha TN GOP is the shame of the whole nation right now
Holy cow! Do you mean to say that there's a hypocritical Republican leader?! Donald Trump will be shocked!
Republicans' obsession with legislating everyone's sex lives is projection.  They think everyone is dangerous because THEY are.
What a shock a Republican who acts like a wonderful person while behind doors they are some of the worse our there😜😂
Damn.... everyone's a sexual pervert or gay.😂
🤣🤣🤣
The more they try to shut up democrats the more we find out they are the worst among us!
Skilled liar = republican
A finr Republican member.
Republican closets are so packed with skeletons that they have to store many of them in storage rentals! 🤮🩻
Remember, this guy isn't just a Republican -- he's a leader demonstrating to others what is allowable behavior. It's interesting how TN Republicans, who ran on "open/less government," get into office and then want to keep things secret and pass legislation interfering with citizen rights. Had the results of the secret committee not become public, this guy would still be in TN Republican party leadership.
Dont fool yourselves. Pile on is fun when its the other team. When you have touchey feely Biden the Dems have no leg to stand on , or a shoulder to massage or hair to smell.
How come GOP didn't kick him out immediately?
Why are they so corrupt? Republicans just seem so sexually deviant and honestly evil. Except they want to appear to be moral guides on how everyone else’s life. Repugnant
Sexual sickos on the GOP are all over. I hope Gaetz the pedo have one day his day to be accountable.
Common practice amongst the Grand Old Pedophiles ( GOP ).
Karma is a fair bitch
He needs to resign. The GOP full it. They can have criminal backing. and still get away it. The young black men trying to stop gun violence that’s a problem.
If you think this is just a Republican official’s issue, you’re naïve.
Trump loves this douchebag FDT
GOP not again, where’s Quannon , hypocrites, where’s Marjorie  and all the other finger pointing loudmouth republicans?
It's Always the sex crimes with Republicans. They hide it & they cover it up for each other. But the true Sex Fiends turns out are Republicans.
Another corrupt/pervert GOP member uncovered.
INVESTIGATE ALL THE RETHUGLICON MAGGOTS.
RETHUGLICON TRAITORS TERRORISTS AND WHITE RACIST DOGS....NO EXPLANATION
He's full of Fecal matter.
Did they really say with a straight face that the amount that the taxpayers are going to have to pay. In order to move this girl is confidential . That's bold as hell! They do know there is a committee that tracks every penny that is spent by them right!? Like that's bold as hell!  we can spend your money but we are never going to show you the receipt 😅
Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy. Hopefully he will face criminal prosecution and be sued for all he owns. What the hell is a consensual conversation? That sounds like a creepy way to say it’s legal to harass women as long as they talk to you. 🤮
If other channels did this deep a dive George Santos wouldn't be slithering through the halls of Congress. Great work!
Kick them all out, kick all the maga republicons out! There is no room for racism and sexism in politics. Turn Tennessee blue.
Piece of ----!😡 There are probably many in that chamber that needs to be investigated. 😒
Well you know if they overlooked Trump being a married man and sleeping with a pornstar and dismissed it as nothing here we go again they're disgusting and they're Hypocrites and he did do something wrong
Thank you so much for doing the work that most apparent" journalists" are not. This is the honesty and accuracy and integrity we need today in journalism.  for example fox lies w impunity and has absolutely no integrity giving journalism a really bad name, .maybe true journalists should work to get rid of the dishonest ones in their field.
Number one why didn't she call the police and two why isn't this national news 🤬!!!
What a pervert.
GOP = The Diddler Party.
He looked exactly as I expected. Sort of Peter Griffiny.
Typical man.
They should Schlapp him with an indictment. These Republicans have no shame. They accuse the Dems of grooming but they dont groom. Just sexually assault straight away..They dont agree with consensus, but this is taking it to extremes.When he was confronted by the reporter, he must have got as dry as the Death Vally, because he immediatly started glugging on his canteen to get his mouth unstuck.
Pedophile, fat nasty POS … Republicans think it’s okay to marry children…. And yes I know the girls he was talking to were 19.
Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy
Interesting how the party of name callers always succeed to be exactly what they will call someone else a depraved disgusting monster that's them Mega Republicans every time their secrets exposed⁉️💯 This man is DISGUSTING.
this tape will be used at the defamation trial when she sues his fat *ss off. he called her a liar.  - they had to go so far as to move her to get him away from her. the dishonesty of the republicans knows no bounds.
Why was he "quietly" found guilty? Oh I see, no transparency... so the norm. Evil pieces of garbage.
Cult tRump MAGA is where criminals go to grift and pray on morons, as well as sell out their country.
Scummy 🥺
It's always the ones that look like him, act like him, doesn't matter what's their political inclination,  that assume  that someone would be interested in him. Bet he drives a sports car.
Get to take money even tho  ! Not when I fuc up we have no rights only for the rich powerful  and WHITE - WHITE HOUSE  THE MOCKERY
Repugs are the party of perverts, that's why they scream so loud and point fingers at everyone else. They are guilty, know it, and try to deflect attention from themselves.
This isn't going to end well. Hide the sharp objects and put this guy on suicide watch. 😮
Remember you have a choice between Republicans and Democrats on Election Day.
Truth will come out .   And set the guilty running to resign.
Wow.  Heavy with shame an East TN GOP lawmaker pushes racism while he is sexually harassing young interns.
so it was a secret ethics panel? why was it secret folks? something tells me if they were investigating a democrat for an ethics violation it would be all over the news!  Amirite?
Maggie Tratior Green calls Democrats pedophiles, and rapist, ha, she needs to clean up her own party before she accuses another. Distraction from the real truth of behavior that the repuklowns hide. The Repuklan Party of misfits, derelicts.
How did the media sneak up on him if he's told this is going to be handled internally and secretly/this is a done deal the man is still clocking in and out of work-   How is it the media came up to him and forced him to resign?!  Who leaked this?   He never thought this was coming out  He should have pled no contest!
Here for the right-wing comments. lol
These hypocrites are hilarious 😂 😃 😄
Karma is "BLACK" now!  Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson are 😂 even more vindicated now!
Nobody does hypocrisy better than the GQP.  Truly a despicable bunch.
Its just so unprofessional and the gull of this man. Trump way has rubbed off on all this creepy republicans.  They think they are above the law. We will catch. everyone of you for not doing your job and think you can just do what you want and think it will not affect you. Seriously….Think twice.   Glad he resigned.
Eyewitness proof of another Republican pervert
Way to go investigating the truth behind this immoral act. Hope other networks pick up this and your upcoming investigation and show the entire country where real scumbags thrive and cover for one another.
What other crimes air the GOP hiding, simply to hold the majority seats!
good news he will no longer serve to harass young women he had hired to work with him.  He "didn't know" work place harassment policies extended outside of work. bet he doesn't know his phone and devices ever used for work are subject to search if found suspect of Severe company violations? 🤔 🙄 🤔
There's not very much to say. He is not alone, there are a whole bunch of 🐘, that's in the room😮

This guy went to the same school of lying pervs as Prince Andrew.
Consensual: “You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.” -Inigo Montoya
Doesn't surprise me at all. That's absolutely egregious behavior and nothing was done about it.
Shameless!
Next molester/rapist  before the jury  is their idol Trump
u ARE ALL JUZ LIKE ur republican  leader's, 😂🤣😅😶‍🌫️u MUST BE REELY proud🤯🤕🤢😱😭
Every gop accusation is a confession of guilt. projection projection projection.  Tennessee keeps voting in these gross old perverts.
Haha at least we got one man hater to resign from Tennessee who hate. You are found guilty so you are the liar man-hater, and got busted by a woman I'm loving this. Tennessee we need to change it blue. We already know lawmakers hate you. To rising Stars following Martin Luther King's legacy thank you I'm loving you all.
Good. Quick, non-wordy journalism from interviewers.
You see how corrupt the so called moral Republicans are. This party proposes to be so righteous and above board but are nothing but sexual deviants and liars.  It's obvious this guy is a psycho and a liar.  Don't throw rocks at others when you live in a class house.
This is just disgraceful. He knows he’s lying and he’s despicable. All of them have behaved horribly.
😂😂😂 That POS is not going to be missed!
GOP means = no mirror to face because Republicans are hypocrites
And his position as their boss is of no consequence huh?  Because they’re consenting adults?  He must have signed into his mandatory sexual harassment training & then gone to the bathroom for the remainder of the class🤨
Crickets from Matt and MTG
Yes .. KEEP INVESTIGATING 🔎 🔎🔎🔎🔎🔎
AND ONCE AGAIN, THE PARTY OF (LAW/order)KEEP being found guilty of sex crimes.
Hypocrite.
How is it that for the majority of cases involving lying, voter fraud and sexual harassment it is mostly Republicans? It must be a plot by Antifa & Dems to discredit the GQPS unblemish reputation 😂😂😂😂😂
Wow where anybody  get the idea that this has become acceptable behavior , the new normal? Oh yeah the same guy who lowered all the other standards of decent behavior . One more  degradation he inflicted on this country that we might not recover from
Just fire that idiot!!!
The Geriatric Oligarchy of the Pusillanimous has moved beyond "projection" in its litany of crimes to a FOX-style 24/7 broadcast.
Republicans gonna Republican.
Damn, what is it with Tennessee politicians these days? What exactly is “consensual adult conversation”? How’s that song go “ talk dirty to me “. 😂😂😂
Wow, he was a piece of work. Yet the Republicans continue to cover up bad actors. Just saying
Hypocrites=most Republicans
What a sleazy pervert. Good job Channel 5.
He is such a loser. Fcking incel. He doesn't know how to act around women!
He resigned before they could find more sh!t that he's done...
WHAT A PIG!!!
Typical Right Winger.😂😅😂
Bye, Scumbag Felicia!
Typical!!!!!!! But Then Again, HE WAS ONE OF THE BOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND ALWAYS, THE RIGHT COLOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Expel is not enough. Now go throw a temper tantrum.
So the Republican party is supposed  to be the party of morality, holier than thou are nothing but hypocrites, sexual deviants, closet gays like Lindsey Graham, cheaters during their marriage like that Greene woman, and a cover and protector like Jim Jordan for those who knowingly sexually abuse young athletes.  There is nothing moral about the Republican party and would not recognize morality if it sat next to them.  They are all sick, evil, twisted and liars.
why isn't this guy in PRISON🤬
God Don't like ugly, and not to fond of cute either!!!
Creep! 19 year olds are kids still, not even 21 her father should kick his sorry sorry ASS . Dam perv talk to women your own Age .
You can’t turn back now. Shine the light shine the light! All of these reps are under the microscope!
Hypocrite thy name is republicans !!!!
What you do in the dark always comes to light!!!!!!!!
There's sexual deviants on both sides of the aisle.  But only the GQP is hypocritical enough to ignore violations from the white guy while punishing the black guy.
Disgusting
Good job TN
19 year-old adults. Vs people using their rights to protest
God works in mysterious ways! God is working on all those evil racist Red States. It will soon turn Blue by the hands of the Almighty God.  Can I hear an Amen...
Delicious hypocrisy.
Gross ick they all gross
In response to the Tennessee three this  deserves a meal best served cold. 😋
They the biggest pedos and pigs out here! And he’s is a racist
Another "good ol' white boy" exposed. At least the Tennessee official had the prudence to resign. Compared to misguided and delusional Trump who is a sexual predator, and who completely denies his misdeeds (even after the misdeeds have been proved) and who has the gall to preach to others about moral behavior.
Disgusting.
GOP are disgusting and damaged and sexually frustrated, immature and not in control
Next Election , Old Guard OUT !!!!!!!!!
There's much more to this that needs to be exposed, my guess is that half of the Republicans in the TN Legislature is guilty of the same or worse.  Stay on the scumbags for the whole truth.
“…..It doesn’t get any more defined than this, this is the epitome of the “POT CALLING THE KETTLE………You all can fill in what you’d call it, too each’s their own”!!! G-MOMMEE
Way to go channel 5 !!! Most excellent !!! You must not be anywhere near the fox channel. Nice consenual conversation with a total slime.
Bye bye, you sick SOB!! Clean out the TRASH in Congress!!! KARMA is coming!!!
They really DON'T KNOW HOW  to win votes, do they? Now I see why cheating and lieing is so important to repubs!
every accusation is a confession with these guys.  (G)eriatric (O)ld (P)edophiles
Catch your breath ol boy, we know u are nervous and lying.  No interns want to talk to you, no future for you!
I think he should’ve resigned, that is definitely an embarrassment. With that said, it seems like a lot of people commenting forget how they talk online with other people. I bet some commenting here have said plenty of sexual things to others, being on a dating app or Snapchat. If that guy was sexually attractive, I doubt anyone would have been offended. That’s a bigger truth that no one wants to admit.
The three he voted to expel protested for gun reform to save the lives of the people of TN. Meanwhile he was sexually harassing women. They didn't even expel him even though he was breaking the law. The hypocrisy and racism in full view. CRT is not a theory it is a fact.
Thank you and keep digging.
Let's not forget  lying sex offender   Cavanaugh in  the supreme court.. so many under deserving people in important jobs..
All Gop gave secrets
The hypocrisy stinks!
Shocker…
SEXton keeping a guilty sexual harassment congressman while voted to expelled the young black congressmen who standing up for their constituents...
I’m surprised the victims are the opposite sex.
I feel so sorry for her. Like, she wanted to be an intern to be subjected to that disgusting behavior.
Typical Republican pervert.
"Um...one does not get written up for consensual conversation."
God is come houseclean
And then, the RINO MAGA folks will grab them by the pus....and let them all know who is boss...in their finest Christian National and Biblical voice and authority.
Tell him to stop playing the "double Down Concerto".  He should have kept DL presence.  But, of course, racism always wants attention.
When can we expect your report on the Speaker's extra-marital affair/ mistress?
😬
Welcome to the Karma Cafe.....😮😮😮😮😮
Ooooooooooooooooooooo this is crazyyyyyyy 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Tennessee the ancestral home of the KKK from out there around Dixon to the now home of the RethugliKKKan party enough said
Over here in Holland we call these kinda people 'geile glimpiepers'.
GOP = gobs of pus
There's no such thing as a consensual conversation with adults.
Sometimes you have to squeeze the sleaze.      Real Americans thank this news story for forcing out the sleaze.
He forgot his roof was made of glass and started throwing rocks. It's a Republican thing. He thinks what happens between coworkers outside of the work place, doesn't count. So now you know: if your boss tells you "if you don't blow me I'll fire you" but you're not in your job, it's completely legal and moral. Know the rules!
There is a whole slush fund for this on the Federal level. Didn't Clinton do the same thing?
Sheesh!! Sounds like good riddance Resigning better than him being impeached and or being thrown out. He didn't want to go through a hearing or trial. Of course he could still face civil charges.
Creepy, creep.
It's more just like him in the United States Congress.
I wonder if Mr. Campbell say "POLYGRAPH"!!!??? Hell did I spell that right? Renegade 101st.
This is the common news cycle with most Republicans, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, religious bigotry, mysoginy and sexual harrasment, corruption, grift, treason, defending the "right" of crazy people to go on and shoot everybody, or just plain ignorance and at the same time trying to claim the moral high ground. It amazes me the amount of people that can overlook all this and support these guys with a vote. I guess deplorable people will always support other deplorable people.
Silence is not consent. I have been in the same position as the Interns. I was silent because I didn't what to say or do to stop it. I was deeply embarrassed, Any man who doesn't take no for an answer is a predator.
I’m sure will sexually assault some woman in the future. These are the scummy conservatives that are legislating the nation about morality…I am sick hearing the details about how disgusting this piece of crap man is!!! Why isn’t he in jail??????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best thing this good ol'boy could do 🤣😉..
Great job of exposing Tennessee GOP hypocrisy! The cost should be subject to public information policy  since taxpayers had to foot the bill.
Another GOP PERV !
Increíble pay back is a b……..
This show you that they're hypocrites. He should have been expelled when they know what was going on and  investigate it Backwoods hillbilly state
short and sweet, the guy (X-Rep Campbell) is a misogynist jerk...I could use other terms, but this one suffices.  However, I do need to add he is an incredible hypocrite as well...he feels justified to expel the "Tennessee Three" (who stand up against gun violence after a mass shooting in their state) b/c they broke "decorum"; but, he thinks that just because he is not at work, that he can have "consensual conversations" with adult women who really do not want to converse with him as he makes them feel incredibly uncomfortable discussing imaginary aspects of their sex lives which obviously is NONE of his business...hence, sexual harassment charges get filed against him.  And what is his defense?..."I did not know that a work place policy could be enforced when I am not at work."   Dude, get a life! So when a kind of behavior is labeled as "sexual harassment" and you know there is a policy against it (to protect those it may be perpetrated against), you somehow think that it is okay to then engage in that prohibited behavior when you are not working?!? There should be some sort of required feminist classes for just such ignorant, misogynist men, like Campbell.
Good journalism.
Once again…those republican family values 😂😂😂
You really can't make this 💩 up🤣 if you didn't believe in karma before this might change your mind.
The groomers are the Republicans! Always what they yell about the Democrats doing, it’s exactly what they are doing behind closed doors!!!
He even looks like a pervert pedo!
And of course he thinks he's an adult. Behaving like an utter shit is more to the point. 😐
Typical Rethuglican Groomer
My, my, how the tables have turned....
In Tennessee  words does not matter he should have had forced sex as the basketball coach( superintendant had with  the underage female players. Tennessee   people are Bible  touting sex feans that are in leadership positions. That is how we flow
Being a piece of shit is a prerequisite to being a republican leader
So, he committed a crime and was secretly found guilty!!!!!! But, the three that wanted to save kids from getting shot down, they had a big to do and it was all on TV!!? Ummm 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
He's a pig.
Throw that dirty shit bag under the jail.
This is why abortion is very important to women specially young one against these kind of prolife pervert men!
Karma is such a Bitch
Oh Lord! 😮
Lying again, when are we not going to see this type of behavior from these type of people I am just sick and tired of seeing this   behavior in our government and from the people who we are supposed to trust.
The Republicans are disgusting. Period.
The majority of white males and men are Savages Thugs Bullies and Gangsters. They can't work around FEMALES without turning into Jack The Ripper.
This is one of the reasons why all of our politicians should be subjugated to a background check several of them to look for any racial tensions or Tendencies and to look for any other laws they might have broken before we give them that power to speak for the people because in  Essence what they're showing us is they're taking that power that we've given them and covering up their own crime while throwing the book at other people who who may have done lesser crimes I trust none of them!
What a bunch!
Another awesome example of projecting and reflecting smdh
Preview of Trump ending..
Its most appalling how some of the Republican lawmakers have broken the law.
This Republican leader dug a hole for others that he fell into,  Moral of this story  "Do not throw stones when you live in a glass house. Karma in Action. Hayman and Mordecai from the Book of Ruth in the Bible**
And was allowed to resign instead of being fired, typical!
😂😂😂🎉🎉😂😂😂
Typical GOP republican pedophile while expelling others... GOP largest group of hypocrites liars pedophiles and sexual predators on the planet.
At least he is smart enough to make the best decision for today. The rest of them should follow suit.  GO AWAY . With no respect at all THOMAS , Trumps & anyone affiliated with this self righteous conspiracy idiocy.
It was an insurrection
Of course, it's another conservative charged with a sexual harassment crime
All these perverts and weaklings in the Republican party... sick ass people.
I sure hope someone leaks the settlements made on behalf of all politicians in government cause it’s probably massive and we ought to be able to hold them accountable as taxpayers.
PERSON A:  ¿What is Sexual Respect?  ¿What is Sexual Love?  ¿What is Sexual Sensitivity?

GOOD
And a liar
All WhiteTrashEvangelicals must resign.
Gross pervert I agree to
A pervert in the G.O.P..., no surprises here. Carry on...
GOhyPocricy
I've said it many times. The ones who point the finger, have bigger skeletons in their closets.
Why do you Americans still call the Republican Party " Grand Old Party"?
Why say it like you had some consensual adult conversation, if it didn't involve some weird sexual comments or questions? Do you consider all your conversations with adults as consensual adult conversations or just conversations? What an odd response. Why would you think that interns are good candidates for such a conversation anyway. Why would you think any employer hearing about such a thing that involves an employee and an intern would turn out any other way? What a creepy guy.
THAT guy is sexually harassing ANYONE?  Keep voting in morons everyone!
Another Shady lying totally dishonest Republican
Another republican hypocrite bites the dust...seems to happen about once a week
Another Republican scandal. Figures. They have no bottom!
He doesn't deny the conversations. Instead, he says that he thought he was having consensual conversations with adults. You're guilty, you sexual predator. Somebody put this guy's name on the sexual predator list.
Thanks God has his Hands and 👁️👁️👁️👀👀 on All of the World Evilness.
I don't understand why this young intern felt uncomfortable with this very handsome gentleman.
He’s very disturbed….those young ladies need protection.
"You know that!!"  Yes Ma'am!
What do you mean the GOP had their own secrets. Democrats were not keeping secrets. Their were throw out of legislation, in full view of the nation.
I want to know what's in the cup he carries around everywhere. He seems drunk..
Do. Not. Stop.  Stay with this story.
Fantastic job
Unbelievable
And with that he’s the real problem not the 2 black men
Every one of their “cover-ups” is being EXPOSED. When you “Dig” a hole for someone, like you did for the 2 Senators, you forgot to dig one for yourself!! Look who had to “RESIGN” Now. I told you GOD does Not like ugly, neither HYPOCRISY, and HE will expose it every time.
GOP is so cowardice.  It's a damned shame.
This would have never been investigated if the 3 people they tried to expelled and one of them brought it to the light.
He made the dam LAW and has no dignity or integrity of being a human being and he is a racist at the same time all this should go on his record.
Another hypocritical Republiturd. Surprise, surprise!
Republicans have never taken responsibility for the scum in their own party, they constantly whine and lie about Democrats claiming",democrats lie, democrats don't believe in freedom of speech for snyone else, Democrats are violent etc well tRump the Republithug party's god constantly harassed President Obama about his birth knowing that President Obama was born in America to a white American mother, they called Michelle Obama and the Obama children names while whining about anyone calling the tRump family what they really are, they talked about Hilary even after she boldly submitted to a grilling for over 11hours while that lying grifter constantly refuses to answer for his lies and his encouragement of tampering with the vote, the list goes on, the Republithug party has no shame and from state to state they show themselves to be a bunch of lying, racist, sexual predators of lack of morals and lack of decency!
Republicans are just bad people. Folks, they’re simply bad human beings.
Beedy eyed, lying Slob.
Another Republican accused of sexual harassment. This entire party is disgusting & corrupt.
Well trump gave the green light too grab them by their 🐱
Keep Voting BLUE for AMERICAS and JUSTICE and Women Rights  !!!!!!
Why are republicans getting busted for this so often 🙄
Liar liar pants on fire 🥰🙏😇😍
No surprise here they are often vile and demonic just like the ones in our federal government 🥰🙏😇😍
Revelations these guys already knew about huh?????
Good Job
Funny how they always want to throw stones.
Be careful for what you ask for. See how the Karma came at his racist self. 😂😂😂
Hold on let me get a sip of water and my lie str8.
When you are a political science major, does the curriculum include a lying course?  Dude it is so apparent he's lying.  He failed his Lying 101 class.
Racism never wins.
How creepy and disgusting. And threatening. That's okay but some duly elected legislators who are speaking out a little too loudly because they're being silenced-- that's just fine and dandy. These people are disgusting
He's insane and disgusting.
Are Republicans warped sex freaks??? The GOP supports sex freaks. Self righteous and holier than everybody else is a front for deviant sexual behavior.
These people have no sense of principle, human decency or morality!
A sick man n sick party
Republicans pervs are multiplying at a fast race...these are sickening pervs..
This is how it goes. This crap used to be in movies. Now it's status quo in our reality. The whole idea of transparency, but only when it is to see the other side while your side exercises secrecy and does not enforce what your party demands happen to another party, is a combination of hypocrisy and corruption. I used to look at the Dems as the party of this behavior. Now things flipped. I see Republicans are that party. Things were bound to change over a long period of time. That's just how it goes. People like this should not be in any seat of power. If you're too ignorant or too willing to ignore policy, then you do not deserve that position.
He didn’t think he did anything wrong. CLEARLY he’s done this before and never held him accountable. They don’t fire this guy. They end the internship of an innocent individual.
Thank you Sexton for being a hypothetical racist with zero ethics. It cost your buddy his job and I couldn’t be happier.
The two man in Tennessee were expelled because they stood and marched with students. And yet this man only resigns after an investigation by a reporter. Those Republicans had absolutely no is with sexual harassment, just black man marching with students. Not shocking at all to me. They've always been hypocrites.
That figures, that plaid tie he wore the day the Tennessee three were expelled told his whole life story.
Finally some good news. It's not much, but it is at least one person undeserving of their position removed.
Whether he spoke to them off work grounds, on public streets or in government housing, he sexually harrassed those women. Whether both responded back to him, his demeanor and questioning was inappropriate, especially since he was in a position of authority over them. A lot of these conservatives are truly ignorant and hypocritical.
Some advice to consider for Scotty Campbell (& potential future Scotty Campbells): just bc you’re talking AT someone & the person happens to respond - especially when it’s to get you to stop talking to them - doesn’t mean that you’re having “a consensual conversation” (which I guess is the new term for sexual harassment?). It means you’re a creep who refuses to hear the words or understand the body language of a person who you’re making uncomfortable for your own benefit.  Also, proper conversation topics w co-workers should NOT include or involve your sexual preferences, fantasies, ideations, etc.; the basic rule of thumb is: if you wouldn’t say it to a man, then you sure as hell shouldn’t say it to a woman, & the same goes for touching, but multiplied by at least 10.
One down...how many more to go? ? It is about time we get rid of all bigots.  Same in every red state.  Enough is enough.
The gop is so corrupt
Great reporting! Thank you. We need our journalists
The GOP is right on brand. Vote to expel the black guys for using there 1st amendment right, but refuse to expel the sexual predator. Sounds about right.
Trump would've just grabbed her in the p***y...🤷🏾‍♂️
All Republicans are rapists  pedophiles, and sociopaths. They don't deserve to breathe the same air as the rest of us.
Pathetic.
This is what he deserves
Wow what a disgusting pig 🐷 How can you be in such an important position. But harassing interns?  Being a Member of the GOP/Right Wing means that you will be the subject of false allegations and True Scrutiny.   This doesn’t mean that we the right wing will automatically Forgive or Assume it’s false.   If you are a Right Winger reading this know this here and now. We Are Not a Cult, and This is not the Party to get over on people and find shelter from Perversion.    Also watch out for Liberal College cultists trying to Lure and Bait you into troubled waters. Find God and follow Goodness.
The commentary that they had their "own secrets" is misleading and so stupid,  because it is comparing him to the 3 that were expelled, implying that they had secrets.  Just idiotic news commentary.
When you point one finger, four more are pointing back at you !!! Don’t live in a glass house and throw stone’s.
Naaaaa guy, you GOT FIRED
Just look at him. Textbook.
He’s a pervert
Sure seems like a lot of republicans are engaging in sexual misconduct!  With young people yet the republicans are calling others sexual predators!
How are public funds used confidential?
Lock him up!!!
What a creep
NO CHOICE BUT TO RESIGN.
Only in a legislature can an ethics report be kept confidential.
It's too bad that there actually has to be a non-harassment policy to get Republicans to behave.  Obviously, even that doesn't always work.
DISGUSTING.
“Uh give me 5 seconds “ Takes long drink…stalls by asking pointless questions. Then lies and obfuscates. So obviously busted. Gotta love watching them squirm.
Tennessee is full of bigots far right extremists and have an agenda to destroy democracy and install authoritarian control of power to control the state. Sad commentary on state of this once great state.
ŴħA† A ＄ħA๓㉫. ﻝµ＄† rÏdÏඋµし✿µ＄.
Thank you for doing this story! I pray for the other women who had to deal with him. I'm sure this isn't the first time. What else is going on in secret?
He should never be in office !
Republicans are so disgusting cult, get them all justice matters!!
Seriously, America. Can you elect your representatives a little better? Is the genuinely the type of people you want to represent you? What is wrong with you!
GOP at its finest.
Karma is the word for today Y'all! When your head gets so big you forget you can still be caught...I'm glad this is what happens.😅😅😅 Hood for his ass. More to come!
Typical.
*GOOD (double-bleep) RIDDANCE!!*  That piece of garbage should have been gone a long time ago.
Like any 19 year old girl wants that fat short too old gross guy. Just yuck older men aways trying to get barely legal girls, it's just disgusting.
Racist assss sexually aggressive repulsive republikkkans.    No one is safe from these dyck sick poooosey hungry whyte male republikkkans.  They even use their wife having sex with pool boys to get them off.  These people have no limits.
Good Grief, hear we go again…….Do as I say Not as I do, pathetic creep, so he needs a policy to know how to behave, Shame!
Keep going after these corrupt officials. Get them out of office, how disgusting!
Good
same men who would love to see gay and trans people in prison fetishizing those same people...who would have expected this behavior from a republican
I wonder what was different in his situation that allowed him to stay in office after he harassed the intern so badly that they had to pay to move her away from him, that’s not a question I already know the answer.
Solid journalism!
Qanon has the wrong party 😳
Republicans have taken Trump's behavior and adopted it, believing they have license to act like him. But thankfully, Joe Republican can still be held accountable for unacceptable behavior. These Republicans need to recognize that they can't get away with the stuff Trump has gotten away with.
Every Republican accusation is a confession.
I bet every car in my garage that he is zealously anti-LGBT and anti-weed. But he he is begging 19 year olds for girl on girl action and doing weed gummies. Republicans are disgustingly hypocritical.
A never ending clown car of deplorable miscreants
Why do some republicans hide behind spirituality and Christianity and they evil and racist as hell. This is crazy.
Political Power Corrupts even worse than Most Temptations ?  Congress has an Office that has paid out millions to protect its Own Members from accusations ?  Both Parties !   🧐
Those who yell the loudest are the most guilty
Being held accountable after exposure, so not really accountable to the public with a secret committee.
Democratic peaceful protest vs. Republican sex scandal ---shocker.
Best stuff ever!
Oink
Are any of the GOP not sexual predators: Jim Jordan watched little boys being raped. Matt Goetz raped little girls. Trump raped females various ages from  12 to 40 years. Clarence Thomas sexually assaulted his staff. Lindsey Graham hired gay male prostitutes and then refused to pay them what he owed. Josh Hawley, Roy Moore, Ted Cruz, predators against women. More pedophiles, Majorie T. Green, Loren Boepert, Bret Kavanaugh, and Dennis Hassert. Romney is openly in a religion that is based on pedophilia and polygamy. Mark Foley, David Wu. And republicans love to use taxpayer dollars to cover up their crimes. An extremely large number of republicans were caught using the pimp the D.C. Madam. The GOP is filled with disgusting predators, and that's the main reason why the American people love, protect, and support them.
The Republicans that's in power are undercover pervs. They are passing laws for their disgusting behavior. Vote their disgusting azzes out of office
Watching too much porn.
Campbell talks like a sociopath.
It was reported that they gov. Lee was caught dressed as a woman wearing a dress.😅.
Sickos. Shame on him. Nasty!!
Most of these republicans are homo, or bi-sexual, that was own from the president Trump to most of his staffs. It was reported that pence said, " he was scared to walk around in the office, because soo many were homo, and didn't mind flaunting it in the Whitehouse.
Holy cow bells! I'm reading the comments and some people are saying "it's just flirting". What the heck? Did your mamma  and daddy not teach you what is and isn't appropriate? Good God, the man wanted her to describe sex  she was supposedly having. The guys just a Creep. Ugh
Thé GOP reeks of bigotry, racism, facism, suppression and hypocrisy.   It’s shameful that any decent and sane human being would vote GOP at any level
Nasty MF…. Investigate all of them all political parties!
Whaaaatt?!?!?  I am shocked and appalled!  Lol
They didn’t want too. 😏
There shouldnt be anything done in secret. If there was an ethics panel it should be open to the PUBLIC!
like cockroaches or rodents... as they say, if you see one you are not seeing ten times as many as there actually are. republicans need to be purged from our government...
He was shaking like a leaf there.  That was hilarious to watch.
That's the Republican's way, hypocrisy 101.
Republicans need to stop fucking with peoples lives ✌💙 from Montana
😂! These are some dirty, devil, sun Dodging Dogs!!  🤣🤣🤣 these are the ppl this government Will protect until cornered. I am LOVING all the exposed corruption we already knew was happening! Long live the 1st amendment,  Long live social media 😂😂
This guy reminds me of the cartoon version of Wimpy.  Give him a hamburger today and he'll pay you on Tuesday.
One more repuke creep down.
Great reporting. I am sure that there's more to the story. You reap what you sow
"We received the letter today, he resigned, we accepted, it's over, nothing to see here, have a good day." A very short reply to yet another GQP scandal, which would have been a well-known, typical  torrent of accusations, threats, conspiracies and lies had it been a democrat politician doing it. Saxton & co. would be yelling about pedos, demons, grooming and what not had it been a dem, but since it is, again, one of their own, all we got was this verbal fart.
Yeah people breaking in into a hearing and getting expelled 🎉 I’m pretty sure everyone saw the full video on why the guys who got expelled 😅 Man the left show why it becomes fascist 😅
WOW AMAZINGLY NOTHING NEW THE WAY THEIR ACTING # MANY MORE TO GET CAUGHT
Scotty way to go! Another trumplican bites the dust!
America needs to have higher standards for people who run for office!! It's way out of control that so many idiots and thugs can be in office!
Where does a fat guy like him think he has the right to talk to the young ladies like he did.  That is what Tennessee has for state legislators?  This and the other issues is making Tennessee appear th be a racist and mysoginistic state.  That is what it looks like from my upper Midwest Wisconsin perspective.  Tennessee voters need to do a better job in voting.  Gerrymandered states end up making their state look dumb!
Vicki, you need to buy some CLASS and cover up.
"I had consensual conversations' ## That's a predator. He's done this before so there will be more victims out there.
What's the deal with the pause to drink from the cup with the "Star Logo" then turning towards the camera?????
All these guys are perverts. That’s why they have to attack the left to perform and deflect. These are the same guys who see a rainbow and INSTANTLY think about sex with children.
Everything these people, the Republicans say of others, that same thing they are guilty of and are just trying to hide their guilts. And their followers don't see this. They are so depraved and immoral. They are vulgar. They are following after the footsteps of their chief groper, Donald J. Trump.
Gross 🤮 Decorum vrs sexual harassment. You do the math.
WHO would believed THAT?
WAIT JUST A MINUTE! Are you saying a member of the GOP who promotes family values, conservative ideologies and evangelical christians was found guilty of sexually harassing interns? What is wrong with America?
What a BS story. His resigning had absolutely nothing to do with how he voted on expelling those three. More liberal garbage.
When will the rest be charged and jailed or resign? The entire party is a cancer.
More Republican sex scandals.  How many young women are sexually harassed at drag shows?  None, but Tennessee still banned drag shows in public places to protect the children.  How many interns are harassed by lawmakers?  We don't know because it isn't being reported by leadership.  So much for protecting young people from pedophile lawmakers.  Thank you for making sure this wasn't swept under the rug and that there is one less creep sexualizing young women!
Those TN Republicans really brought the temple down on their heads, didn't they? They made national heroes out of the two men they tried to expel. And now this dim wit.
A real vonservative  hristian family values guy
Yet these MF republicans call us, the ones who are the perverts, Its always projection with republicans, always, they are the ones abusing people all the time, in one way or the worst way!!!!!
😊, 6❤/😮🎉😮😂 🎉🎉😮😂🎉😮😂🎉😮😂😮🎉😮🎉😮🎉r im
Why in the hell is this man speaking to ANY person in this manner?
"Just give me 5 seconds?"
Good riddance to bad rubbish. Lying Republicans gonna lie, then double down and lie some more.
It's so nice to finally see the Democratics and even journalists get into action regarding holding Republicans responsible in your country.
I bet it's all GoP. Expell them. Adults elected behaving badly.
Great job people!
Everyone who kept this quiet should be expelled.
The GOP are always at their most professional levels. Such honorable people, always behaving respectably. 🙈
Guy acts dumb as well. No surprise he got elected.
What a sad little man. I wish there was help out there for him.
O h!  Love it!  Lock him up.
McCarty needs to bounce Santos now for lying to get elected. This is how politicians are supposed to correct problems. Thank you Tennessee.
We love to see GOP Hypocrites on full display ✨
White privilege gone wrong
LIAR!!!! UPS is hiring!!!
The greasy POS has his voice shaking during the interview. What a GOP slimeball.  He must take after Trump who has his rape trial in a few days.
What a pig
So same party that is outlawing Drag Queens reading "The Snowy Day" to kids and their caregivers at public libraries because grooming something something.....🙄
That reporter  - that's how you interview politicians
He needed 5 seconds to lie! Bastard! I hope his life is ruined!
When you dig holes, dig two.
Sexually harassing interns? That would definitely show a lack of decorum.
What nothing to say I mean one of your own did this horrible thing to interns & you  have nothing good to say!!! sure that’s why I call Republicans cowards they’re nothing but the lowest form of a coward you could imagine!!
This, in a nutshell, is why Republicans are so obsessed with what goes on in other people's bedrooms, because there's usually something sleazy going on in their own.
Nothing surprising 😮 he had his nerve to judge anyone,but white women have a history of lies
He did nothing wrong i.e  Gop  behavior ok. But the democratic 3 did all the wrong.
It is hilarious how the TN legislature is now finding itself under a microscope as a direct result of their racist attempt to remove the 2 black reps for being too uppity. This should be a warning to all of the other Republican hypocrites in other state legislatures who are planning similar assaults on American democracy. In 2023 there is NOTHING that you have ever done that won't be brought to light. NOTHING. Keep that in mind all of you Republican s**t-for-brains a-holes. If you want to act like it's 1950, you are in for a rough ride.
I like to watch those who are accused of sexual harrassment, their inevitable answer is, it was consensual act ,and consensual conversation .  The usual answer is consensual conversation which is utter bullshit .
He won’t have to worry about talking to anymore interns.
Fake news, right Trumpanzees?   Unlike the "real" news from Fox liars.
Can we all say KARMA
KARMA! Another Republican hypocrit. Scumbag!
Karma baby
They knew of his allegations and that he was guilty,  and the Republicans did nothing about. it. But they ousted two black men for using a bull horn in a meeting. Something is wrong with this equation. 😕
Another white man sexually harassing women. Really brilliant buddy. You thought you were going to get away with it, but you didn't. Let this be a lesson for men who think it's ok to assault women, your days are numbered.
At what point did the GOP turn away from family values.
Smh dirty sucka!
Got caught with his pee pee down lol KARMA
Deplorable. 🙄
Good Job Phil Williams!!
Pedophilia, incest, and sexual assault  are normal GOP hobbies. No surprise 🤷‍♂️.
Duplicitous monumentally hypocritical self serving republican goons
You are indescribable!!! Low so low omg
This pervert is just like trump he does this because he can get away with what he does  America will not be great  again UNTIL trump and the others who believe that GOD died and made them boss are locked away in a deep deep dark hole and to all the jackasses that lost everything by invading the state house , You deserve so much worse you all are such idiots, and you are still sending the pig your money what a major joke you are ha! Ha!..............
Republicans don’t want to represent.. They want to rule! They’re turning this country into Gilead from The Handmaid’s Tale!
No surprise,good ol white privilege and entitlement!!!
Republicans NEVER think they did anything wrong.
Another good republican freak
Somebody needs to take the entire Republican Party to the shed and open up a can of WTA!!  They have lost their ever lovin minds  So they turn off the mikes of elected officials speaking on behalf of their constituents on the chamber floor  Then when the T3 try continue to do their JOBS they get expelled for talking about children being killed by guns more than any other cause of death for same THEN all the while  this guy gets to harass interns, be found guilty, the Chamber (insert taxpayers) pay to move her and her stuff away from him, don’t publish the findings and let his lardo tub of blubber @$$ continue to sit in the chamber all while sanctimoniously restating how right they were for expelling the Tennessee 3  Do I have that all summarized for the folks in the cheap seats?
If they do enough digging a lot more of those Tennessee Republicans will have to resign. Keep digging.
SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME!!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!!!! typical GOPIGS!!
Unreal, he wants leniency for His unethical behavior, then votes Against lawmakers trying to stand against gun violence? My god what is the matter with SO many in the Republican party?
Yeeeesh! He's gross!!! Ugh.
how could be already 'found guilty' when you are still questioning him about it. misleading title. it could very well be a friviolous litigation case.
Some of these People are Totally Dirty
Oh, the double standard!!!
This sick, nasty lawmaker needs to be CHARGED!!!! THIS is beyond unacceptable. He sounds guilty AF listening to him. Charge the reps who knew and covered it up as well. I want to see these girls SUE these predators.
The worst Driggs  are been voted to republican party haaaa how are we asamerucan canot see that party of late is fir lawlessness and living. So much ipocricy in the party my God we need another party
Pathetic POS! 😡
USA need laws to cut the balls of all sex offenders, like pedo Gaetz or Gym Jordan.
Sounds like conspiracy
It seems to be a party of liars, crooks, perverts, paedophiles, morons and traitors and half the country wants to be ruled by them. Everyone wonders why the Roman empire fell and we're privileged to be able to watch it happen again in real time.
He's a POS and so are Sexton and the GOP "leaders.
So... what does this have to do with the T3's disruptive behavior? Nothing.
Another GOP sex predator.
I'm surprised it took the democrats this long to find a pigeon to serve their needs
All this really shows is that both political parties are filled with corruption.
This is why they see groomers and pedophiles and other 😈 things everywhere. 😏 Because they know what their party is Always up to and just Assume that everyone else is as 😈 as they are. 🤨 The call is coming from Inside the House, Republicans. 📱
I'll take things you won't hear on Fox news for 1000 Alex
Didn't Justin Jones mention that in his exit speech.
What a slimeball.  He got admonished, but claims EVERYONE is a liar!! Wow he must be friends with MTG!
Years  he guilty
Great invstigative reporting.  I cannot watch this disgusting hypocrite.  Well, at least he resigned for his "indecorous" behavior.
Are all REPUBLICAN politicians sexual perverts??? See what happens when you are a Trump followers.   Yes I know Democrats are creeps, but this is getting out of hand with Republicans Sex Skeltons coming out of the closet
Sexton banged my sister
The liberal cult has come for him.  It's probably made up like Russian Collusion.
They all do sexual harassment just look at Biden wife Jack and Jill when up the hill to a kiss💋 from each other😅😅
MY GRANDMOTHER  ALWAYS  SAID DIG A DITCH  FOR YOUR BROTHER YOU BETTER DIG ONE BESIDE IT BECAUSE  YOU GOING  TO FALL INTO THAT DITCH  YOU DUGGED  THAT SAVAGE  HAD NERVE TO VOTE AGANIST JUSTIN  JONE N JUSTIN  PEARSON  N THE OTHER RACIST  ANIMALS  KNEW WHAT RACIST  CHUBBY  DROVE  WAS DOING  TO THAT YOUNG WOMAN  NOW LOOK WHO HAVE FALLEN INTO  THE DITCH  HE DRUGGED
He should have been throwing stones at hisself and get mold out his own eyes first before pointing his fingers at someone else..And pointing back at himself ain't know telling what all the White House is up in doing
sex molesters and liars how respectable fathers and mothers can support the GOP is beyond reason they should not be allowed near the reins of power nasty nasty lowlife
Does anyone remember Teddy Kennedy? He killed Mary Jo and got away with it.  Was that Okay with everyone.  Does anyone remember Slick Willie and his cigar? He was charged with perjury and got away with it.
Lol...They open pandora's, box, in chambers, and now it's blowing up in their faces!!!...
Imagine that the GOP ok with sexual harassment but  talking through a bullhorn for gun control is a sin. PATHETIC GOP
Looks similar to the democrats of today
EVERY TIME A SEX SCANDAL COMES OUT IT ALWAYS ALWAYS REPUBLICAN. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO INVOLVED IN TEARING DOWN AMERICA TAKING US BACK TO THE 1800'S. SORRY REPUBS WE ARE IN THE 21ST CENTURY AND THIS IS NOT ALLOWED. DON'T U SCUMBAGS KNOW IT'S COMING OUT. LOOK AT TRUMPTY DUMPTY HAS AEX  SCANDAL CASE GOING TO TRIAL THIS WEEK. KEEP ON SHOWING AMERICA HOW SCUMMY U DOUCHE BAGS ARE IT IS GOING TO HURT U IN 2024
Why is it that Republican men get themselves into such trouble when interacting with women? Is it the Baptist Church “it’s up to the woman to control the man’s behavior” and if the intern isn’t a Baptist she expects him to know right from wrong or?
No such thing as "consensual conversations". If one side says things that are inappropriate and the person responds, isn't consensual.
I hope the biden administration and the Democratic party hands the American people a taxation you will not believe what fools Americans are
He doesn’t think he’s done anything wrong because the entitlement and superiority complex is blinding. These interns need to sue him. All they wanted to do was learn; all he wanted to do was use his position to take advantage of them sexually. That is definitely unbecoming behavior of a so called representative. Shame on him.. Make sure his political career is over and he’s never around young women and children. He can’t be trusted.
Imagine if the gop Congress held santos accountable... or pedo-gaetz... or nutjobs green/boebert... or white supremists greene/gosar.
Hypocrisy-Republicans; still trying to find a difference.
Oh that’s gotta hurt. The world gets to see proof of how bad the south and republiCONs are. Then this Racist POS has to resign because he’s doing to his interns what the lying CONservatives say about Drag performers. Remember it’s projection with republiCONs.
WOW!!  I am amazed how he has justified his behavior; he truly believes he didn't do anything wrong!!
Of course the trash is a crook
How about the guy peeing in the chair. No decorum and public indecency. Or the speaker not living in his district and having a mistress while throwing black reps out for decorum. Racist and zero judgment or character. RESIGN
I’m glad he was found out, and left Office. But he should have been expelled.
Karma
WOW 😲. A GOP leader actually doing the right thing?!  Refreshingly odd.
Two hours ago, on Facebook, I had to remind a Republican voter puritan that GOP leaders are constantly exposed as sexual deviants. Constantly.
Is there a Republican out there who isn't a rapist, paedophile or creep?
This is a new one to me consensual conversation!!!
What it's like to live under the Tennessee Taliban.
Call the police on him
Sleezebag politicians 🤡💩👎
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm so shocked!! NOT!
Par for the course with so many from the "party of family values", isn't it? I'm guessing the only reason he resigned and they accepted is because of you guys.
Where in the world do these creepy, inappropriate, lying, lawmakers come from ? Thank God he’s been pushed out.
Own the CONS one at a time
This doesn't SHOCK me anymore with these GOP idiots! Always ready to take away from someone else but don't look at their own nasty behaviors!!
The Republicans expelled two senate members for supporting the safety and welfare of the constituents of that state while a sexual predator is in their midst and had the audacity to be one of the loudest voices calling for the expulsion of the two. Can't make this shit up.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Wtf is a “consensual” conversation? When you make degrading comments but they don’t immediately beat the shit out of you?
Vomit
The Twnnessee GOP better buckle up because they're about to find out what FASCISM costs. This is just the beginning because "those meddling kids" have just started investigating EVERY SINGLE MEMBER of that legislature! 🍿 at the ready...
Smdh! Even when they already know it has to be brought out in the public eyes to make the GOP do something about it!
Well.....I am without speech Where is that blonde gop loudmouth? She would have plenty to say about this......right?
YIKES!
What should be of absolute top concern in all this isn't even mentioned in the clip, but it can just be glimpsed in the document from the committee's investigation. Despite finding that he had in fact done the harassment that he was accused of doing, the letter says "The Subcommittee strongly urges all individuals, including the media, to respect the privacy of those involved in this complaint" which initially sounds like they're being very thoughtful, but then "In accordance with the Policy and Rule 82, no further information concerning this complaint will be released." So despite being found guilty, the Representative had nothing to worry about until these investigative journalists dug out the letter. His GOP buddies certainly didn't move to censure him or strip him of his leadership roles, which says a lot about them and their own lack of ethics or even basic morality. I can't help wondering how many other letters like this are out there, that nobody even knows are in existence, aimed at other elected officials.
The hypocrisy! These GOP!
Imagine how he would have felt if someone grabbed him by the p*ssy...and then that guy became the most powerful man on the planet.
These inbred Tennessean voters will still vote for the Republicans.  Thank God my family got out of this hateful rednecks over 70 years ago.
Good work.
This guy is disgusting...
I would say we are probably close to a majority of republicans who are guilty of harassment, assault and sexual perversion against both women and men. They want permission to “check” the genitals of all women who want to play sports in some states. I guess they’d have to check male genitalia as well.
Republicans are so disgusting and evil...
G=greedy  O=old P=perverts
Consensual conversation?!?! What kind of sleazy scumbag idiot thinks like this?
Accountability is good for us all regardless of partisan hysteria.
Even if it is consensual as he claims it is, I can't imagine the dirty mind unfit to be a representative
MAGAs love pedophiles
Gross
That is awesome! FANTASTIC journalism! That is how you do it!
DUMB A$$ 😮 😅 😂
Bro just got a Godsmack, for being a hypocrite!😮😢😅😂
An employee-superior relationship doesn’t mysteriously dissolve when one steps out of the office. He gives off a creepy vibe that made me uncomfortable through my screen. The party may need to pay for these poor women to get therapy. And stop their skin crawling.
WTF?😂 Not alright to protest about guns,but alright to sexually harass, what is up with the white folks that are running the country?😅
He stu-stu-stuttering. That drink of water proved his guilt.
Now investigate joey biden for sniffing and fondling kids
Good Journalism
You need it on video, Then he can become famous, then run for the White House. Be elected and have a whole room of interns.
These GOP congressmen are good Evangelical Christians doing their job.  Give them a break.
Maybe he thought his last name (Sexton) gave him the right to sexually harass interns.
Still go after the GOP Republicans in Tennessee
Dirty hound dog! Look at him, tho! 🤢🤮👀
Am so surprised he would sexually harass females...NOT!! he has trump for a leader ffs!!
Hold all accountable
It be so crazy that they say Democrats are the ones 😂
Their Just Demons!!
He is a pervert!!!😂😂😂 He ought to be ashamed!!😂😂😂😂
We obviously need a little more decorum in the workplace! Keep your filthy paws out my silky draws!
What a freaking scumbag! The 2 Justin's are Heroes while that dude is just a perverted POS who is ideal for today's gqp.
Glad to see local journalists doing the good work here. And although I’m glad the house committee quickly condemned this legislators actions, I wish they had simply come forth immediately with it, rather than hide it from the press.
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 karma karma karma karma karma karma karma karma karma karma  is great hahahahaha what a perv 😂😂😂😂😂😂got exactly 💯 what he deserves karma is alive
MAGA: BEFORE 1492
Damn Shame that he could cast judgement on 3 individuals that are actually standing up for life and he’s sexually harassing interns and these so called conservative hypocrisy men did not remove this trash.
Now time for all the 🤥 lying
Wow
Oh 😂 happy 😊 day
Republicans, wrong deniers till the end.
"Give me a second. (Takes sip) which way do I need to face the camera?!" The whole time stalling to buy time to cook up a lie. Damn hypocrite voted to expell two black lawmakers. And the whole time he's sleeping with adult teenagers.
HUMPH!!! This "GOOFBALL" was quick to add his "John Hancock" to expelling two genuine, highly intelligent young "black" men who instead of grossly "sexually" harassing young interns as he, were simply doing their job for the public who elected them to help them w/their concerns, concerns involving gun violence, a SERIOUS, life threatening concern/cause that everyone should take an strong interest in for the good and safety of everyone. Good riddance of him, and may all the rest of those racist, crooked Tennessee republicans resign as well, but we know that's not going to happen no time soon.
What a piece of trash. It's rare to see a member of the GQP resign after their skeletons have been revealed. This guy is disgusting.
How great is this!! Good ole boy is getting what he deserves and everyone else who was aware of this should be investigated as well!!
Karma! She should file a police report and get him arrested.
Keep the Karma coming!
The Tennessee clowns should be expelled and this perv clown should be prosecuted through the court system but that doesn’t really work anymore either.
Good job Phil and Ch. 5
Reminds me of RALPH SHORTY !
They are ALWAYS  Projecting or Confessing
GOP = Gang Of Perverts
I don't care  what political party these politicians are or in general...sick sexual predators need to be held accountable.
Like we always say *karma is a bitch!"
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Typical GOP hypocrite. Sexual harassment vs. speaking out with a bullhorn. I applaud the reporting.
These men should look in the mirror and consider how young women will actually feel about their overwhelmingly good looks. 😂
Meanwhile everyone is watching the funeral of Dr. Charles Stanley... founder of Intouch Ministries.
Should be CHARGED!!!
He was a bad apple 🍏
Turns out Republicans are the "Groomers"
Ran un apposed maybe time for at least one the talkers to run for this Reps former Job.
The Republicans are such disgusting hypocrites. In this shameless post maga era, I'm surprised he resigned.
That’s Right, GOP STANDS FOR “Grand OLD PEDIPHILES.”
Well, Mr. “I’m not guilty” you sure decided to resign amidst all this investigation, didn’t you?
policies are useless if not enforced
These republicans are all perverts!!! Dude she is 19... what the fuck is wrong with you? You need some type of help before he gets to full of himself and start raping or molesting. He needs to just unalive himself
republican accusations are confessions
The Republican who voted out the Tennessee 3 Karma :  Republican  Campbell - has Resigned  He had been found Guilty of Sexually harrassing College interns. Despicable!
Republican piece of crap says what? Lock him up
Good News .👍
Disgusting Slob!! 🤮
Too bad he didn't resign before he could vote against the famous 3 Democrats.
A creepy incel!!
Just another politician getting Fat off the hacks of the citizens of Tennessee.
hey the senator from tennessee needs to look at what her bible says about this
Thank God, I don't want to/think about having any kind of sexual incounters with the people I call my friends. Damn, if that's the way it really was in this world, we would All be DEAD From ALL the Illnesses  , smdh
OK, as soon as this man was asked if he indeed admitted his guilt, he First, HAD to take a drink?  Was it Just Coffee, or maybe Tennessee Whisky & Coffee?  Hum?
sexton and the rest of the repugnantan leadership is just as guilty at campbell
The republican wasn't going to resign until it was found out. And he still votes OUT the Tennessee 3.
Consequences.... had they not raised the spotlight by their vindictive expulsions of the Tennessee Three, this might not have come to light 😅
If they verbally agreed, why has it been reported????What an idiot!!!
karma is a ...
Another  "BRIGHT  EXAMPLE"  of  the HYPOCRISY  and  DOUBLE STANDARD  of  the  DISGRACED  and sewage wallowing of the "Maga- Trumpian"   GROUP.
What a damn liar. Pathetic looser!!
One less perverted GOP idiot to deal with.
Ha
Stop calling him GOP LEADER in headlines. Say his name
Everything he did and said crossed the line of sexual harassment and predatory behavior. He's been doing this for awhile. Come forward
More proof GOP are perverts..
Porky looks like the only way he would be able to get anyone to touch him is by harassing them.  What a disgrace.
Lock him up ... put him in an orange 🍊  suit .
Gop! Why am I not surprised 🤦
Republicans are all scum.
All they did was reveal their own deadly sins...that is how good wins over evil!
Reading this not in Tennessee and not in the USA but living in Europe. This is how much the tarnished reputation of certain lawmakers in your state has spread I am afraid. What appalls me is that if the local TV station had not investigated this as well as they did, he presumably would have stayed in power and felt emboldened to repeat this behavior. There is a lot of anger nowadays at the "other side" but as the father of a daughter close in age to these interns, we must unite on all sides to make sure such behavior is called out, whatever the politics of the individuals concerned. This is not about right and left but right and wrong.
“I mean just five seconds” 😳 Who’s calling the police?
Wow, are these those very Christian baby-savers who Bible thump, scream and need to actually read the passages about forgiveness, not throwing the first stone and testifying to get a new apartment and other perks? Sounds very stinky fishy to me!!!
Karma is a sexy woman
Ladies...don't engage...you NEVER have to talk to someone like this....and he is disgusting..and the whole incident is gross...eww
This is the kind of perverts that makes up the Republican party for the most part and the entitlement is off the charts that they believes that they can literally force their disgusting pathetic mindset on everyone around them and this racist here he will not stop who ever hires him again he will carry his pervertions  with him because he is not being made to face punishment for his actions , these are the demented people that sits making decisions for people's lives , America
The GOP regrets they get in the lime light with this expulsion. There is no way they could swept it under the rug, now.
Yeah fkn right! Those fools shouldn't have been allowed back in. That man running around acting all ultra black is playing a role. Let his azz go get a job on Broadway if he wants to be a actor. This whole thing is bs as usual when it comes to the Dems. Remove all of em, redo the entire damn party!!💯💯💯
The führer of the GOP, Donald Trump, is a misogynist, serial adulterer, whoremonger, and a liar.  What do you expect from a humble GOP state representative?  The GOP is the party of sexual deviants and liars.
He was so shook that he caught dry mouth syndrome.
What a shock. A deviant asshole.
These are the people trying to regulate what other adults can do. I guess if no one says " I'm uncomfortable" the. Whatever indoor say is ok. Great advice!
*I can Honest to GOD say, that I have NEVER Had Any such TALKS* *with Any GirL (or guy) in My Life Time!!!!  Such TaLk has ALways-->* *been Nasty to me!!! & NO!!!  I Don't BeLieve in Lord JesusFuKery!!!!*
Not acceptable behavior at anytime. Public policy does include after hours conduct as well.
Probably young men
This wouldn't be much of a story, if he had not voted to expel the three Democrats. Sex scandals in D.C. are as common as the candy of their choosing that sits on their desks. I'm not condoning his behavior, but this story is just beneath the surface. There are way more state and federal stories to investigate than some out of shape sexual predator, who just happens to be a state rep.
“Consensual” sexual harassment? 😮
Little Richard jewel. Poor thing 😢him and his little @#$%&r .😅
You mean the party of family values are sexual predators? unfortunately I’m not surprised 😂
I’m a boomer, & retired now, and I can bear witness that men’s workplace behavior in “Mad Men”” was spot on. Everywhere I worked with men, I had to listen to all kinds of nastiness, on top of the temper tantrums they threw, when they didn’t get their way. No, it wasn’t all men. But there were “nice guys” around, nearly every time, usually just sitting and looking at the floor.  If you see this going on in your workplace, and you’re a man, please say something. Most of the bullies will listen to another man.
GOP : GRIFTERS,  OLIGARCHS and PEDOPHILES.   Cop killing Constitution terminating Trump supporting traitors.
Did he just say she's not protected from me if I can get her off of work property before I accost her
They didn't fight for him because they are trying to give the people something bc of the backlash from expelling those two black people that's all 😢😢 wake up people and don't fall for the okie doke give us something we asked for not something you wanted us to have bc how long was this going on in the first place
It's ALWAYS Republican perverts.....can't make this up.
How was he even able to serve on  any committee voting against anything with all his lies and hypocrisy .  All these people on this committee with charges should be held accountable
I'm sure there are plenty of hot 19 y/os going crazy over his dumpy ass.  Honest mistake lol.
It never never fails...smh GOP trash
Oh republicans
🤣😅
The thin white skins... He thinks HE is the victim here...🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
The GOP hypocrisy is off the charts these days! They've become a parody of themselves...
More Rasist sexual predictors in the Republican party???
Big guy lost a few pounds he might could get him a female
Trump's cobrother??
GOP=HYPOCRISY....At least he was man enough to fall on his tiny little sword...😂😂😂😂😂
Glad they got got this weird dude out!!
now get Sexton to resign!!!
The GQP party of hypocrites and scumbags
Best interview of the GOP ever!  You can almost smell him thinking of the lies he gonna tell when he says "just give me 5 seconds"
when white men target black men, and become a target themselves.😁 Stupid.
He's guilty. Watch him stall...with a sip off the bottle...sick puppy.
Karma is beautiful.
Repugs . . . Ugh!
I'm sure he'd use a condom when the GOP lawmaker rapes a 19 year old. Keep an eye on the Republican wretch that resigned AFTER BEING CAUGHT.
It is called do on to them what they do to you.
At least the GOP got rid of him....unlike the dems. Definitely a slant by the media. Expulsion of the 3 was a correct choice.
GOP: Gaslighting Obnoxious Priques Pure projection with neener neener nanner nanner deflections.
Groomer
Shocker
Karma
Good riddance
I thought government spent money was supposed to be open to the public. Aren't we suppose to be able to obtain government spending  through filing freedom of information act forms, to receive them? Why are they making the confidential? What are they hiding?
Basically a pervert. Yet he wasn't expelled. I wonder why?
Haha I’m loving this news!
Next see the documentary about Gym Jordan!
wow, and this is being reported by two female barbie doll reporters in short dresses and high heels.  They look ridiculous.  Is this a Fox news channel? The hypocrisy is glaring.
Were they male or female interns?
A GOP accused of sexual harassment? What? NO say it ain't so. 😂😂😂😂
GOP=PREDATORS/PEDOPHILE
❤❤❤😂😂😂😂!! GOD!! HAS SPOKEN!!! SO LET THE CHURCH!! SAY AMEN!!✔
deer in the headlights at its finest when he's called out after a friendly good morning 😅
Great investigation! Keep going.
Funny how the "Family Values" party keeps on showing us they're anything but. Abusing and harassing women and their rights is front and center.
A communist democrat would never resign. Republicans are quiters.
Every Republican accusation is a projection.  Like 50 republicans have been forced to resign for S.A. and pedophilia since Clinton's BJ.
The MOB rules in America nowadays.
They knew he was doing this & held his trial in secret🤔 While in public he & the rest of these hypocrites are expelling Black lawmakers for “breaking house rules” It’s the _audacity_ for me 😡 Bunch of cowards
Lol
Thanks,you got ride of him,dirty rotter
And they will vote in another scumbag to replace him, while ousting legislators that want to serve the people.  Sad state of Tennessee.  And you wonder why most of the country views you as backwards.
Why does the GOP attract so many sleaze balls? I mean they’re just becoming a caricature of the slimy  politician. I’d love to know what company would hire this guy,now.
What the hell just fell out of his mouth?
Typical.  Look closely, and you’ll find that people who abuse their power in one dimension also abuse it in others.
DISGUSTING and BIGOTED!!!  P.O.Shit!
Hahaha 😂
This shocks no one they are Racist Lying Traitors !!
Cringe levels reaching heights not seen.  Good job cleaning the trash up Channel 5! Also what the hell is a stealth ethics trial?
I'm so shocked😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Perve.
Wow. He knew he was politically DOA as soon as the reporter approached him. Had to take a moment to reflect on his predicament.  This is quality journalism. Thank you for exposing the hypocrites who lead the Tennessee GOP.
Groomer???????? Republican???????????? No No No!!!!
❤ excellent job! Thank you! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
His career is gone; thats one of the effects of hypocrisy ; HE NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED more, there is an assault there  too💯💯💯 GOP, wake up from your  disgraceful slumbers and messes 🤔🤔
Typical no backbone sumbuck
Law makers breaking laws? Oh my… what’s next? Water being wet? Ugh
I can't watch this. Too much of a fool on display always turns my stomach.
For him to stand there and speak to the reporter says to me that this man is a fool. Just how stupid can you get?
All three of the disorderly Reid should be expelled. They aren't going to stop as they don't follow rules.
Typical. Most of the abysmal sexual deviates are in the Republiturd party!! Look no further than their leader, the Chumpturd, with 27 counts of sexual assault/harassment. You know... the p*$$y grabber in chief, #45!!!
He’s 39 and they were 19-20!
The two who were expelled were disorderly and the third (whites woman) also. If this is true about this man certainly he should go also BUT!!!! Tell me how can this administration then allow drag queens sexualizing dances actions at a public school and a off work conversation get this man ousted? Twisted and once again comparing apples to oranges. If he thinks that conversation was private and consensual maybe he should take it to court.
Just goes to show the GOP has double standards.
He didn’t lose his position because Republicans don’t care who they harm as long as they have power.
Well now
Go Phil!!!! Great reporting!!!
Some people really need to learn how to say "no comment" He just kept digging the hole deeper.
Some people really need to learn how to say "no comment" He just kept digging the hole deeper.
Goodbye
Typical pervert pretending he's never wrong. Probably hands around the collection plate in church too.
Anyone notice that every /majority scandal involves a Republican seems like it's Cultural!
The irony is so rich
If MTG was investigated, I bet you’d find the exact same shit, Republicans only accuse others of things they themselves do.
“Give me five seconds…” 🤡
I can’t believe they didn’t boot him immediately. Well…yes, yes I can. Hypocritical 💩s.
How convenient.  No shortage of women to make false complaints.  No harrassment by Biden or any other Democrat ever. White supremacists control women and minorities through the Democrat party like they have for decades. Sad😢
Shameless Banana Republic Party 😅
GOP - Group Of Perverts.
Man you can see him sweating from here during that parking lot interview
These sleazy men in government. What is going on in American politics. A president who brags about his sleazy behaviour this bloke and many more taking advantage of women. Yuk. When are future politicians going to have an ethics checks or even truthfulness checks.
Repukicans at their finest
Course he didn't...they are all crooked.
SHOCKER!!! Republicans republicking
Such TOUGH "MEN" with their STRONG stance on compensating for something tiny over their love of gun violence in kindergarten. Real men are like this, is what I believe of every republican who comes out "STRONG" against anyone's right to exist unless you're unborn and are in a tween's womb thanks to uncle Jim Bob.
And this is why I'd never run for office...too many skeletons in my closets   🤐
Why do GOP MALES CONTINUE TO SEXUALLY  harass females is this a white things women are there for just for men like him to do as they wish because women are inferior to men
Every white guy in America is a little whiney hypocrite just like this little klansmen.
Why was the hearing held in secret? These are public servants, the people have a right to know about this.
Looks like Tubby Dumpkins is goin' back to his trailer park...
Republicans seem to be very lax with their morals from the top, Trump, down including Republican appointees to the courts.
Well done!
Stand up for human rights and safety, get expelled.  Have sexually harassing interactions with people, receive a hush hush ethics hearing.
Hallelujah 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Republicans/ Democrats/ Independents,  all are politicians.  I see no political I see a crime. Bill Clinton when he was President also had his time with an intern. He is a Democrat.
Well done to these Journalists for holding this reprehensible, GOP Liar’s feet to the fire. Of course he was completely abusive / attacked her - he’s another Republican Poster Boy for INCEL. Kudos to the Interns for filing a report - very brave. Of course nothing was done by his good ole boy, white, racist, Republican chums in the Legislature. The rules only apply to Minorities and Democrats. There should be a full investigation as to WHY this Member was not ejected after those findings and after that letter was sent. “Birds of a Feather”.
Oopsie.
**** it's about ethics, a quick check, if you are ok with this, like this comment ****
I don't know why they are giving this guy such a hard time. It is not like he grabbed them by the pu××y or anything.
What a creep! Disgusting behavior by this dumb lardo toward young female interns in his office.  Equally disgusting is the GOP  good old boys network in the Statehouse who would have never taken any action had his behavior not been exposed by the media!!! Where is Southern chivalry and decency?
Republican presidents first name start with D last name start with T republican senators They love doing illegal things to women and always pointing fingers at someone else calling them evil or criminals. LMAO oh well their just doing what their fathers did. Carry on
Thank you Phil Williams!!! Champion journalist 👏 🙌 💪
They with their conspiracy of democrats grooming and prostitution with kids lies ..it is so far most current Republicans that are caught doing these dispicable things among themselves and in their private lives ..Gaetz...that drunkard  judge ....Greene cheating on her husband harassing kids about gun control...they are speaking in behalf of all their guilt ...icant even keep up with all the perverted and abusive incidents in this GOP
“Quietly” found GUILTY
Doesn't he own a mirror? He should know Noone wants him.
I thought that's adult conversation? She went to his home to return what? Lol, she knows what she was doing going to his home
Didn't know murder outside work would be a crime inside work.haha.
“But when your a GOP lawmaker, you can do what you want, fantasise about them in girl on girl action, grab them by the neck” Anybody else see any similarities to their cult leader here?
The Democrats don’t need to work so hard to persecute members of the Republican Party. They’re doing a good job of that all by themselves.  This, coming from a Conservative Republican of many years. Don’t these idiots know Republicans are held to a MUCH HIGHER standard than Democrats.  And why is that?  Because Republicans have earned the moral high ground by constantly striving to live moral lives. When any of them step off the moral high ground then that person becomes the person that Jesus disliked the most in this world; A hypocrite. Jesus also didn’t care for the judgmental.  Any Republican currently in office or thinking about running for office better know that if they can’t occupy that moral high ground, then they need to get out and stay out of public office!  Especially creeps like this guy.
Hahahaha listen wife folks don't start none won't be none we all knew this mess was going on for years when blind eyes was turned to it then you tried to get rid of two black people speaking their mind about saving your children.  Finally, the people said enough let's see what you've been doing and there it is. Now you listen  round white man no 19-year-old intern is having any conversation like that with your round behind so stop lying cuz eventually as you see it will catch up with you.
Ol freaky deaky!!   The question is: will there be charges filed?
So Campbell is unseated, correct? Or is it the usual double standard from the GQP? The "rules for thee but not for me" party...
So how was this kept secret? If the media hadn’t blown his cover, would he have resigned? Why didn’t the ethics committee expel that creep? Those interns were young. And he’s old enough for it to be really creepy. WTF! Nineteen may be legal territory for someone to prey on, but it still makes him a predator.
Another Republican.
Sounds like Bill Clinton and every Democrat on the Jeffrey Epstein flight log to the island.
thirsty cup holder
" One doesn't get written up for consensual conversations"
Bunch of Perverts
I WILL USE CAPITAL LETTERS FOR MY QUESTION. WHERE IS MTG?
Dirty Republicans
MOST REPUBLICANS ARE SEXUAL PREDATOR'S ALL THE WAY TO TRUMP... NOT A SURPRISING STORY HERE.
Can't make this up
Local news to the rescue!
Some guy said "When you are a star, they let you do it."
Pendejo.
Imagine that It’s GOP representative.
Damn got his ass
all conservatives are rapists and pedophiles thats why they are always projecting onto drag queens
What would have happened if the secret meeting never became public? Would the politician still resign? Or would he carry on with business as usual? My guess is that if the secret meeting had not become public, he would have gotten a slap on the wrist, and business would continue as usual. This is why Republican politicians are disgusting. They never practice what they preach and are always doing what they accuse Democrats of doing.
The Republican Party folks. 🤡
Tsk  Tsk
Great investigations, keep it going.
GOP seems to be morally completely bankrupt...who needs those?
Tennessee "Three" reps got booted for violent reckless temper tantrums and obstructing official proceedings, VERY serious crimes; see Jan 6th.
Dumbass.  He wants to go on about decorum, huh?  What about his own personal decorum in his life.  Freaking hypocrite.  Shame!  Lets this be a warning to all the other dumbasses out there that y'all can't keep going on like you've been going on.  Start shaping up already and get off the MAGA/Q'Anon/Conspiracy/Anti-diversity dumb shit already.  I'm sick and tired of these last 7 years of dumb shit by Trump, bible thumping conservatives, MAGA, etc. ad nauseum make me puke.  Have a good day.
This is perfect KARMA!! They would’ve kept this quiet. Never would’ve come out.
When are the GOP members in the US House and Senate going to resign for their vulgar behavior
Isn't the timing convenient?
The nazi party is the most corrupt that they've ever been in the history of the country.This fake b******* rape reporting happens every time they want to get rid of a GOP
What a coward..obviously that was a set up. And the girl that's accusing him of doing. It is lying through our teeth. Obviously.
IMO,  where is the proof,... guilty fine ... but it used to be that allegations were not proof... if he is guilty , then he should be punished to the full extent of the law... but just allegations prove nothing.
Fuck The American Taliban
Why would a congressman have a swastika on his mug? Somebody else please check it out! My eyes might be lying to me. It's the red cup he's holding when channel 5 anchor asked him about the sexual  charge. He's also got it (the cup) when in the halls of Congress. That should be a red flag for anyone seeing him. It seems to be his cup of choice.
Ahhh, Vice-chair of the GOP "COCK US." 😮
Well, the pervert scumbags are learning that the chickens WILL come home to roost...
Unacceptable behavior? yes of course. The y.ou tube channel head line says guilty. 🤔 isn’t he only accused? Asking for another citizen.
He is the quintessential republican
How many more
With a trembling shaky voice he lies about his despicable behaviour, what a joke.
Republican Values
ah ya, this is the same guy who wants to ban drag readings, right?
damn. despite their propaganda, it seems like the biggest group of sexual deviants and offenders are republicans, not trans people after all
He is one of many hypocritical scumbags
Good job, Channel 5!
Sweep around you're own front door 😂
Why was he allowed the dignity of resigning? Should have been fired immediately! Shame, shame, shame on the GOP and their hypocrisy.
It’s only consensual if both parties agree to it not one those that didn’t hold him accountable should resign as well but of course these clowns get away with everything so why would anyone else above him resign.
WOW People that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
Skeletons, skeletons.
All those guys are dirty low down dogs
It's amazing how many "christain" GOP creeps 😳 there are who are so sleezy
Wow. The GOP didn't even care to address it.
Wow they investigated themselves  and actually held him accountable!!!!!  That’s got to be a first
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My state never had enterprise journalism at the only commercially licensed TV station... they have "investigates" segments but it's just lip service for people in power. And my state is dark purple.
Another Republican scumbag being protected by other Republican scumbags until they can’t anymore!  He thought his “friends” would protect him because he agreed to expel the 3 democrats who did not sexually harass anybody, who did not say sexually explicit comments to a teenager and who were not legitimately found guilty of violating State House law!!  I hate these these damn scumbags!!
Glad he was caught and us paying the price. No job.
I don't think k bro knows what consensual means.
shes 19 rapist
Every complaint is a confession from these GOP hypocrites!
liar busted
crooks liars corruption
These people should not be allowed to govern no one, Ever!
Pervert😮  💥
He dug a hole for three, he should have dug one for himself. Absolutely hypocritical of him and his re-thuglican cronies!
His body language betrays him, but he is accomplished in his obfuscation and believes he can justify his (reprehensible) behaviour. Watch his hands as he answers the allegations, it's a subconscious way of blocking uncomfortable realities. People tell two stories when we communicate orally. With our mouth we impart what we want you to believe, with our bodies and gestures, facial expressions and involuntary tics, we tell the truth; the subconscious mind has no concept of lying, and functions autonomically. A REAL man would take responsibility, and apologize; this chap believes he's above the law, and above the ethics directives of his Office. He is an hypocrite.
19 year olds//// wow
Believe all women.
I'm surprised, how long has this been going
What a proud example of  Republican leadership.
Maybe Scooty resigned so he could join Crossfit and find his chin ...
BYEEE😂
i hope that joe will do the same thing. 2:45
The Tennessee Three should never be allowed ever again.
Why was the ethics committee a secret? That is a public political body serving the people, not a private organization.
The Tennessee Three are horrible
I think part of being a public servant should come with the requirement of NOT looking like someone who will commit sexual harassment.
THE PARTY OF FAMILY VALUES!
"That number is Confidential?!" *THE HELL IT IS!*
Damn. This dude is not only  a creep, he's a  creep with no game.  who talks like that?
um...you can sexually harrass people outside of work too...and it's still not right. Didn't think a Grown ass Man, a senior law maker, would have to be told that...that's frightening.
He obviously felt like he was Donald Trump, you know the "grab them by the 😺" man.  I mean, the GOP defended Trump, why not this guy? Trump only had like 40 allegations, this guy is at two........
"That's Not True..." *GULP* basically: Oh she told all of it...oh $hit
Denial is obviously a river in his head
Public Servants should not get "Secret ethics panels"
HIT THAT LIKE BUTTON!
Yep,these disgusting people need to look under their own beds and in their own closets I’m sure there are many many more secrets and corrupt behaviors to be revealed it is amazing that people like this get elected get elected to begin with. This low life has some nerve “ consensual”???? No you made a person feel horrible and you violated this person!!! That’s not friendly nor is it consensual!!!Unbelievable!!! Racist, backwards trash!!! I hope the light is finally beginning to shine on Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Texas corrupt, ignorant politics
Squeal piggy
Typical GOP pervert dirtbag
Every Accusation *IS* a confession.  reminder: not a Drag Queen in sight
He missed the entire POINT! That, which many POC call that ‘White Mumbo-Jumbo’. Like he’s quoting script, ZERO EMPATHY, dancing around a direct answer: Reporter: Did u say these filthy things? Put your hand on her..?  Simon LeGree (Stoic, Deer-Caught-In-The-Head-Lights) “I thought I was having a consensual verbal conversation. Next time I talk to an intern I’ll be sure to record it.”  WHHHHHAAAATTTT??!!! So, you aren’t accepting responsibility? So, ya’ playing games like I don’t notice you’re dodging the issue. Playing the ‘Re-Structuring Sentences ‘ so as not to admit guilt?
What hypocrisy. He should have been removed. But here we see karma at work! 💯
They wanted the spotlight they got it......Karma will always come back  to collect the debt.....little short out of breath freak...
He lies with a straight face. Does anyone still believe any politician ( from any party) has credibility? Both the corruption and illicit wealth garnered in politics is staggering.
What a slimeball!
Bro people in Tennessee gotta have the worst accents, either that or these two dudes are just mouth breathers
I guess he could not just gaslight his way out of it? You know, cancel / woke culture, fake news, etc.?
Great reporting!!! This is what speaking truth to power looks like!
This is what happens when you forget you are a "public servant" instead of thinking you are "entitled".
Talking about karma
Why are they trying so hard to link this to the expulsion vote?
Many of yall are missing the point, the GOP knew about this.  All those Republicans who voted the two BLACK members out, knew about their WHITE counterpart actions.  Matter of fact, there's a couple more TN Republicans that has a checkered past and was never expelled.  And this guy only resigned after having backdoor conversations because they know the country/media is looking at them from this day forward to see how the double standard is when Republicans actually do crime and still remain in the house.  I ganurtee this guy would have stayed seated, and his white counterparts would have stayed quiet and turned a blind eye if the media than bring it to light.
Not surprised at all!
Good, get that perv out.  Oh also, all three of the TN three.  Attention seeking frauds
SEXUAL HARASSMENT 😮🤨🤔😨
😳🤦🏾‍♀️🙏🏾
Great work on damage control.. democrats are pathetic.
Now if a dude walked up to him talking like that he'd call the police for Sexual Assault.
Thank you NewsChannel 5 Nashville - keep up the good work!
Time to get rid of the other criminal in those position of law makers. Those thuggs running rampit in the country
Hahaha hypocrite. Oh I'm your sacred floor of the Sacred chamber up Tennessee this is vulgar and against decorum and therefore he should be removed instead and I find it hilarious and he got what he deserved.
I don't see a problem with this. Isn't this par for the course for the Republican Party?
Kudos.  So good to see investigative reporting still survives.  Thank you.
Nasty fat thang - they think these young ladies want anything out there and he probably got a wife that's why he left his job so fast.  SMH just nasty
Innocent people don’t resign……………….
Jesus I've never seen someone shit their pants so fast
One word for this guy: Weasel
No matter how he turns it it's still a lie.
I know nothing about Tennessee politics but this obese pink guy walking around with a waterbottle strapped to his waist is downright creepy. Imagine this dude living in the apartment next door approaching you and asking you sexually charged questions. There wouldn't be a bucket deep enought to contain all of the vomitting. 🤮
More Republican scum.
Can you imagine being TWACKED on gummies and then phil williams approaches you with a mic and camera crew? THIS IS NOT HAPPENING THIS IS NOT HAPPENING THIS IS NOT HAPPENING THIS IS NOT HAPPENING
Fire them when they do this, but make sure you fire from both camps,  if I start seeing slanted coverage on these issues I'll be guaranteed to post for the opposite team in spite.
so they successfully kept his vote by keeping the scandal under wraps until the day before the legislature adjourned until 2024. every bill he voted on after  his ethics review should be recalculated minus his vote.
So Riddle me this batman. What does a person being a pos "supposedly" have anything to do with kicking out 3 ppl being actual proven pos in front of u? I'm failing to see a connection batman. Media as always dumb as rocks
It's the Biblical Hypocrisy, Stupid. Thanks at least for his confession. How do tr*mp sect GOP evangelicals keep a straight face? Thanks for carrying this story.
Hypocrisy strikes again!!
One by one, the wicked will fall. This I foresee in my crystal ball 🔮 Blessed Be.
Just to be clear, tax payers paid to move the intern.  He should be forced to reimburse them.
Typical Republican, but I’m thoroughly gobsmacked he had the decency to resign.
What's going on with these Republicans.   Lt. Governor and now this guy?
Every republican accusation is an admission...
Ha,ha,ha.... f'ing pervert !
bro. no.
They said what the spent on relocating the interns is confidential. Wrong. How they spend taxpayer money is public information. Hit them with FOIA.
What does this guy voting to expel three morons have to do with this story.  Nothing.  Just thought you would throw that in huh.
What's good for the Goose is good for the Gander!  So  This perverted publicy elected official is Gone!... GOOD!   All as a hyper sexualized society that celebrates every perversion, even grooming & sexually exposing CHILDEREN to adult drag queens! Promoting the delusional destruction of students that are convinced to use puberty blockers or remove genitals!! Celebrating the destruction of living babies with beating hearts in womans wombs,!  On &;on. Time to   have  ALL the perverted reprobates be expelled from public office, Regardless of What party their hiding behind!!, along with ALL those that support unconstitutional policies, those hell bent on taking away our right to protect & defend ourselves, or taking by forced law our  hard earned income from one person only to Give it to illegals, or lazy, selfish, spoiled people who refuse to work! Choosing to spend their time protesting the police, or the dozens of other Woke policies, as they pop pills, smoke dope, play games & mock traditional values!  The protest & shameful display I witnessed at the Tenn. Capitol was bad enough. But to see the three representatives do what they did and NOT be compared to all the Peaceful people that where Escorted around our nations capitol on Jan 6th, taking selfies with capitol police  and peacefully walking away. Only to be slandered, hunted down , many locked up in solitary confinement for months with no hearings! And to have so many lies told and spread by willing media. And then to see people pushing police around, shouting obscenities. Taking over the house floor!! Come on!  Let ALL those who cheat, lie, abuse authority be held accountable in ALL PARTIES!   SO sick of the media, spending so much time resource & energy, hounding &  hunting down ONE side, and letting the other go off almost without notice.  It's pathetic, and it's old! Time for some fresh unbiased real reporters to rise up from this crap hill of a media circus.
Are there any republicans that are not blatant criminals?
He is so gross.
Which direction do I need to look? Lol
😆
And the Tennessee legislature knew about it and did nothing. Then the media fou,d out and low and behold he resigns
Disgusting!!
GOP should change its party name to Garbage Mouth Party (GMP).
This is what you get if you vote Republican.
Good reporting.
Wow!  A republican showing some principals and actually resigning when appropriate.  All i can figure is there's even WORSE info that he's trying to avoid coming to light.
These damn politicians are like worms inside a rotten apple.
Good for his Ass
And still has a job? How very republican.
Takes no responsibilty.
If this guy was slim and trim with a face of a movie actor. There would be no complaint. Who's the victim here?
Youll investigate a Republican have some fun with a slut???  why don't you investigate  Hillary Clinton  for:  her F ups in Bengazi, her losing 33k emails, her have top secret email on a home computer......  why, because she was a Democrat.
They need Chris Hanson to say take a seat.
Ugh, I am grossed out on her behalf. How can anyone think that this is an acceptable conversation between adults, even if it “isn’t at the workplace”?
This is why we need to support our local, investigative  journalists and reporters. Great work!
I lost a job because I said in an email to a recruiter I do not like doing n- word work, but have to. I just want to answer emails as a job. $25000 dollars a year is fine answering emails. Portable housing benefits should be tied to school and/or work.
If he is guilty, great, he needs to be locked up.  But that doesn’t mean those three should not be unemployed.
This is exactly what these so called “conservatives” party. Quite frankly I don’t even know what conservative means anymore!
2:00 secret ethics panels should not exist. Public deserve the right to know who they voted for.
He is defending his behavior, saying he did nothing wrong.
😂old liquor in the coffee ☕️ cup trick 😂
Great report! Go get 'em!
The party of family values and decorum, yes😂😂🤦‍♂️
Even more proof ALL Rethuglicans are slimy pieces of pepper skin floating in a diarrhea filled toilet bowl.
At least he help expel three Democrats trying to start an insurrection.
Just another republican scum bag why isn't he charged with stalking
Pretty soon republicans will make investigative journalism on politicians illegal once this goes viral.
One doesn't have anything to do with the other. He did wrong. They did wrong. What is the comparison supposed to prove? Were they being kicked out for sexual harassment? No. They were being kicked out for not following the rules. He resigned for his bad behavior. Apples and oranges. They are not related.
Both parties are complete garbage.
As so often is the case, the most vocal of attackers are usually projecting something that they have issues with in their own lives. This is why  free and unbiased journalism that is protected by the constitution is so vital.
GOP CREEP!!🐷
Republicans. What is going on? Why is your party so lost?
Why is this so NOT surprising? 🙄
Pervert!!!
Any politician who try’s to restrict our 2a rights should be expelled and tried for treason. It’s a culture problem not a gun problem. If not for citizens with guns we would all be British. That’s the 4th of July for those who don’t know.
Wag the dog BIDEN and maybe china might be more important
They are all a bunch of hypocrites & clowns
Good work!
No surprise a creep is behind their horrible GOP behavior
Good thing the intern wasn't his cousin, she'd be pregnant already.....
Well, we traded (1) “sexual harasser” for (2) Insurrectionists… It’s a great day for America, and a great day for Tennessee…  GO VOLS!
Everyone should read the book of Esther was the story with Haman and Mordecai. When they build a gallows they should build two, one for themselves too.
republiKKKans are VULGAR fascist gutter trash.
Let’s now look into  this reporters background
Clear, calm, no inflammatory “dog whistles”. Well done.
Surprise surprise.  Typical right wing bullshit.
All is gonna be exposed!
So not because of his vote to  expel the scum? No, because of improper behavior. Got it . Your reporting is bullshit!
Geee…WHO IS GROOMING YOUNG PEOPLE? Why it’s the GQP.
So basically it was a distraction from his own crimes! I swear GOP deflects and projects.
😅😂😅😂😅😂 MAGA
The vice chair of the caucus saying he didn't know what his own legislatures ethics policies were is a bit like Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas claiming he didn't understand the law in disclosing gifts
funny I was just thinking how Tennessee GOP acts like they're still in high school
I legit don’t know where republicans draw the line for a bad gop leader anymore. I’m glad they fired him or whatever, but I feel like it’s something they wouldn’t care about as long as it’s a Republican vote to keep corruption strong.
Rotten...Rotten to the CORE😮
Cameron needs to resign
What goes around comes around, Once again double standard
Omg this is the most amazing news I have heard since the 2 amazing gentlemen were expelled in Tennessee.  Karma works wonders
One down, more MAGAts to go.
" a secret ethics panel"  that's some bing chilling.
THEY ALL NEED TO RESIGN!!!!! RACIST PIGS 🐖 🤣
Coward. .this what u get for letting those nutjobs back in the building.
convenient
Why was he still working during the time he voted to expel the Tennessee 3? That vote should be illegal and now they should sue him and the Tennessee house
Those 3 democrats need prison time along with most democrats…I mean baby killers.
Never anything about hillary's women sex slaves or Obama & Big mike being males and LIARS, or clintons LONG list of rapes and molestations.....or any of the other democrat perverts such as Bite-em.
This was all going to be swept under the rug by these crony Republicans.....absolutely disgusting that this guy still thinks he did nothing wrong
How is tax payer expenditures confidential? Seems like the people have a right to know how their hard earned cash is being wasted.
How convenient.
Every accusation is an omission.
Raise your hand if you're surprised. 😂 Redneck pos.
Typical.  Accuse those of what you are guilty of.  Repuclicans are all either crooks, racists, or molesters.
this is typically inner government showing there muscles we all that now they r bullying everyone who needs it 😡😡
The math is easy. When you’re willing to be a shameless racist despot, chances are that you’re willing to cross the line in other areas of your life. I’m of the believe that most republican politicians have skeletons in their closets.
Yeah I’m called BS.
EXPOSE THEM ALL!!!
Found guilty and resigns, but still proclaims he did nothing wrong ... republican proud! fpos
Gee, I’m so surprised. By calling her a liar, he just opened himself up to a defamation lawsuit. In addition to the sexual harassment lawsuit she should file.
So THIS is News?
Good Job, Phil, so glad to see this tonight-
Andrew Cuomo
Creepy and vile.
Shut the fuck up with this Liberal propaganda and release the fucking Epstein client list. Guarantee they're all Democrats and that's the reason its not being shown we all fucking know that.
but trans people and drag queens are the predators
The comment section is great. Everyone pretends Andrew Cuomo never existed.
He used those 3 Tennessee Reps as Scapegoats, just to hide his own Criminal Tendencies.  That POS should be Locked Up for Life
🎶Another satisfying racial moment🎶
What is harrassment?
Man, these dumb rednecks are so stupid and self entitled it always amazes me. First he is not ready to respond and asks the guy for 5 seconds. Did he think this was going away? Be prepared to answer for your actions! Then he tries to use his being ignorant of the law, as an excuse. Well I guess, pervs are gonna perv... and dummies gonna dumb. BTW, I am the son of a 4th generation Tennessean, so I am deeply ashamed of my heritage this month.
Campbell...what a sick predator. Now that he has stepped down, what other sick things is he going to be doing!. Thank goodness those women have been removed from any place that he can exact revenge on them.  Those girls and any other women need to keep their distance from this sick mofo.
Sounds like he’s basically a pervert by night and sleazy politician by day.   So he says he believes that two women lied.  Hmmm He obviously doesn’t quite understand what a friend is about when it comes to platonic friendships with women.
And he also drove to work that morning, which means absolutely nothing as the vote to expel the three democrats. If he did commit a crime, then he needs to be punished accordingly as the three democrats need to be. One does not absolve the other. Pure political mish mash by the reporters and their station
Oh yeah sexual harassment sure😂😂😂😂
His look of shock and pausing to collect himself shows he thought the info wouldn’t make the news. Disgusting pig.
Now investigate Sexton.
Privilege over responsibility, accountability. When you want to be a boss instead or a leader
edp
Liar!😂
Why in the world would you not ask him directly what the conversations were that he said he had?
Republicans sure hate children, they allow gun massacres in schools, they sexually abuse interns.  In Tennessee it’s not OK to be African American and protest peacefully but it is OK to sexually abuse interns.  Thanks for the warning.
I think it’s hilarious that he mentioned the second one when no one asked.
gotta love how the publically homophobic GOP is secretly dying to hear about two women together. Hypocrite.
Once again Phil Williams has shown that he is the best in his field. He does Tennessee proud everytime.
So this mean the 3 who were leading protesters in the house floor should also resign, correct?
White country redneck bastard
any girl would be falling all over herself to have an adult conversation with this fine specimen of a toe rag
Karma at its best.  It came very quickly.  Your hate will return upon your own head.  Hear how he tries to justify his gross, sinful behavior.  Just think, the KKK Kristians are the third largest religious group in America.  These white extremists are just sickening, pure sickening.
But, that SAME group had no problem expelling legislators for "violating decorum" . The hypocrisy is BLARING😑😑
It's ok when Republicans do it. Secret ethics meetings to find him guilty? Wonder if they want to ban abortion because it's unethical....secret what it costs? It's OK when Republicans do it....wonder why your taxes are high? Blame democrats who did NOT have secret payments to a republican intern who was SEXYALLY HARRASHED according to the REPUBLICANS. Glad I don't live there. Smh who do blame?
If you live in a glass house, don’t throw stones! I believe that’s how the saying goes😂😂
His victims should contact Attorney Camille Vasquez ASAP.  RESIGN = GUILTY   Best is yet to come.
They all should be gone permanently.
It's NEVER gonna get TRUTH if they keep covering up white privilege crime until it blow up in there faces white crimes are covered until the whistle is blow on them, yet it out ,he did just what she said, he really think that BS he saying is believable, consensual only in his deranged mind,white privilege at it's place of white crimes
A republican sex offender?! No!
Wow, didn't take long to find something to pin on him. That's what happens if you go up against the woke mob.
It's sad that this dude felt "empowered enough" to do this. I am sincerely glad that Mr. Williams brought this to the forefront, as he did with several other republicans. Apparently, dimocrats are better at hiding from Mr. Williams as he never seems to find fault in what they do, even if they join an insurrection in the Capitol. Unfortunately, this verifies he is a partisan hack, not a true journalist. Perhaps he can go join BuzzFeed. Oh wait...
I knew it. I knew it for years you were a pos, just like the rest. They all deserve a silence pill.
The audacity. This is what happens when you have a group of power hungry racists who make rules and laws for others and a whole other set of rules for themselves. They hold everyone else to a higher standard than they hold themselves.
Dirty old white men🤢🤢
The Republican political leaders have been getting away with such arrogance for so long they now think it’s their right to lie steal and abuse ,
This affiliate is a stooge of the corporate media. They are presenting a slanted and leftist version of the news locally and nationally. Choose not to watch their programming and watch their leftist view change.
Gross
He should have known you can't trust Democrats nowadays
This man is icky.  😮
People mock the ignoble prize. But that one year, where they awarded it to a study that established a link between corrupt behaviours in public office and obesity? Continues to be one that pays dividends.
haha
Would’ve been nice if he had been bounced out of the legislature for his wildly anti-democracy actions and this harassment were being treated criminally but I’ll take what I can get
Typical hypocrite Republican.
Don't forget that dude with the crappy mlk impression is a fucking traitor to this country and is just another shitty demagogue they wanna push on to black people instead of a real leader, this is how they poison the well and ruin your cities
Should have been a democrat  then it would have been swept under the rug  like all the other crimes they commit daily
Why is it more often than not these sexual predators are GOP lawmakers?
In Tennessee you can touch their girls but don't you dare touch their guns!
Great journalism now do the Biden’s let’s continue the accountability game
Interesting how this only came to light now.
These GOP political dimwits drew the attention of the world with their stupidity…. now the media is hovering big time.
Hah the Grand Old Party!!!!
Hahaha 😆
Every Projection from a Republican is an ADMISSION  FINGER POINTS are always pointing 3 fingers back at themselves.
Well done for this reporting!! Thank you for staying true to journalism!!
Your typical pig
GOP = Groomers and Open Predators
He’s not a drag queen 🤔
Nice to see a politician being held accountable for his actions.
Looking stupid!
Well done! These are the same guys who tried to pass the lowering of the minimum aqe of marriage for females in Tenn. to 12. CHOMO ALERT!!!
How do people vote for these people?
Why am I not surprised he doesn't know what consensual means.
Is that a Republicans do is molest kids and act immoral while hiding behind the Bible.
Biden sniffs little girls, why doesn't he resign?
Good for Tennessee  republicans
LOL The GOP is just projection at this point. Calling their opponent pdf files, while its them. The GOP knows pdf files are infiltrating the government because it’s them.
Somebody please correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t Congressman Pearson mention something about this during his expulsion hearing?!! If so, is this what brought this to light?!!
Now if only the Democrats would release the Epstein Black Book.
These perverts, that’s why they are always projecting on others!!!
Not another God-fearing REPUBLICAN!  Oh, the humanity!
When Karma happens in real time I find myself realizing I still have a lot of soul work to do because I feel too much pleasure in his demise.
How does this have anything to do with the insurrection in Tennessee? These three violated the sanctity of government and this law maker did 1/1000 of what Clinton did. Sad.
The hypocrisy is strong
No proof of what he said..he say/she say bs..
Work place policy can be enforced when not at work …… get outta here
Karma.
Everytime theres one of them being accused of something like this i just feel theyre trying to get rid of them. All of them are dirty. They just point out their dirts when the folks dont follow the "message".
All politicians are slimy crooks
This is a daily occurrence for democrats.
Your sex offenders arent in Drag baby, theyre in suits in your own government 😂
Nice tie. Who picked that one?
Whole body language is guilty
At least he stood there and faced some hard questions, but yeah, the party of fear mongering about groomers gets busted being creepy a.f. as usual.
😂😂😂
Its always those grooming accusing others of doing it!
What does him violating sexual harassment policies have to do with him voting to remove the three other people who also violated conduct policies? It wasn’t like the votes were close and he was the deciding vote. 🤷‍♂️ they’re unrelated
This has no bearing in the dismissed individuals! If he is guilty in his own issues, he'll have his day! I've seen the video and the individuals including the woman should be be out!
Definitely guilty of a harassment violation. Never have adult conversations with employees on or off work unless in the sex industry.
This entire debacle was Selective targeting.  EVERY legislative body in this country is exactly the same, regardless of parties.  Truth is that punishment, and public exposure is Selective, whereas in decades past, these reporters would be tearing all their asses up weekly. I cannot remember the last time, the FBI or various State Investigation Agencies, have arrested anyone in public office, for anything.   No it's Selective. And this was nothing more than a message of revenge.  Shame on this lawmaker regardless. It should happen this way to all of them.  And shame on anyone being led to believe it happens any less in frequency. It's rampant
This is excellent journalism and I appreciate you tremendously!!!!!
Just commenting to up this vid in the algo
Workforce policy applies 24/7 especially when it’s a coworker
Caucasian males… smdh
He's not the only one
GET OUT & VOTE TENNESSEE
i don't think he understands what the word "consent" means
Make America Grope Again
👏👏👏👏👏
🎶 Another satisfying racial moment🎶
What a sicko, he deserves everything he got. Good riddance to bad rush. Those woman must of been very, very, frightened dealing with this predator. 🤢🤮🤢
So morality means nothing 😊
Look at Gawd 😂😂😂
This person is certainly insane
He's a rich creep, there are plenty of them.
Ohh another Republican with so called Christian values.
Another Republican guilty of hypocrisy and  unethical conduct, Color Me surprised
And another one bites the dust. I couldn't imagine being a Republican, surrounded by deviates and grifters.
Good!
A Work place policy can be  violated easily  when a State Rep is sexually harassing an intern
No surprise. His fat, lame ass can only get pussy if he pays for it. When he gets tired of paying he starts trying to take it from the women.
I love this news channel. Stay on top of them. Democracy shouldn't stop in any State  Protect Phil at all costs - keep up the great work ❤😊
This man is a pig! Why did he resign? If he is not guilty.
At least he had the decency to resign.
Reason number 2331 to stay the hell out of Tennessee
Who is the big doofus standing by the speaker? Who felt he needed to also comment.
here were i live people follow you to grocery stores after the government gives your information away on the homosexual government network…
WOW ! ! !
what secret national internet service that only government officials have allows him to look at kids in their rooms and tell them over the phone … i bet its the same service that has gay guys in the government commin to your house or blocking phone calls to veterans or black women…
The problem with being unsafe to be around is when you turn the spotlight on yourself and yell "LOOK AT ME!" - and then people do.  They can see all sorts of things so you need to be squeaky clean if you want to be in the limelight.  He keeps harping on about having a consensual adult conversation but it seems he was the only one doing that.
While I by no means support or agree with whatever he did or said to the interns, I think it's pretty underhanded the way they are attempting to suggest that his behavior towards another intern is somehow related to him voting to remove 3 protesters from the courthouse. Frankly, it seems to me they're using the poor choices and behaviors of one individual to demonize an entire party.
Creep.
What does the Tennessee 3 have to do with sexual harassment????.
So the 3 should be arrested for insurrection then held without bail for a few years.
Lmaooooo you can't make this stuff up! These right wingers are evil hypocrite pieces of trash that will do ANYTHING for power and money. Including knowingly lie and grift to all the brain dead followers.
interns are kids … stop tryna talk to kidz…
I don't care if it is Repubs or Dems. He must be prosecuted. Wha, such an IDIOT.
As a Trump supporter  I say throw him in jail for awhile, doesn't matter what party they are from. Congress should have their federal tax payers slush fund for sexual harassment stripped away.  That includes you president Biden quit touching and sniffing women, Your on  tv for Gods sake !!!!
He didn't know that the rules do not apply outside of the office!?!?!?!?!  My company has done these seminars repeatedly and since the first one almost 20 years ago we have been told that this is most certainly the case.  Where ever it happens, once reported in the office - the office is then obligated to take action.  This guy is supposed to be a state law maker and does not know this?  To call him a buffoon would insulting to buffoons.  I am glad the local news caught up with him and brought this to the public eye.
Waiting on story of the House leader's violations.
VOTE BLUE TO SAVE AMERICA AND TENNESSEE!
All those politicians are dogs
Secret Ethics Panel seems like an oxymoron, especially when it concerns elected officials because who exactly are you keeping it a secret from & why?
Just remember lib media when the majority finally stand upa kick the government crooks out .Your next!
My biggest question is why was the ethics investigation secret? Did the Tennessee legislative ethics panel actually plan to keep this secret and if so, why?
Yet another Republican pig who votes one way and acts another
“I’m sorry I got caught”
I'm sure she and her friend werent leading him on right? I fault the girls 2v1, dude just had adult conversation with 2 adults, yall need to grow up and who cares, sorry not sorry
Like Nancy said no one is above the law and if the law says he should be punished for whatever he did if he is found guilty by our legal system ( not by online self-righteous self appointed judges ) As soon as you read GOP you started foaming at the mouth. If that is all you can see then you are the hypocrites and you are an embarrassment. Look around. Start at the top and work your way down while looking to the right AND left and let's try and hold on to our Country.
Expose the hypocrites!
The plot sickens…
He's a bald faced liar. What a fucking chump
He thought SADE sang all about him... LoL !
Bad week for at least one guy.
Bolshevik news never publishes the democrats crimes.
Typical! But I feel bad for him after seeing how awkward he was with being confronted. I wish he would have been rude or dismissive, that would allowed me not to feel bad for him at all.
The smug look on his face proves how guilty he is. He should be charged for sexual harassments at the very least.
Stubby nose😂
He, and "the three" should all be removed from their positions.  All four acted in a manner unbecoming of an elected official, and violated very basic ethical and professional standards.  Making examples of the right and excuses for the left is the media's current slant though.  Neither is acceptable, hold all accountable for their actions.
Pure hypocrisy these people are all fake pretending to be holier than thou!
You have to know there are plenty of others with worse issues still in congress.Specially since they were willing to sweep this guy under the rug, WoW! Good reporting.
Can I say PIG!!
Democrats use that as a badge of honor!! Rapist Bill Clinton to name one of their favorites!!
Good riddance to traitor trash!
Hoax. Evidence was fabricated by Ukraine, do the research
I thought the dems were the groomers.
You’re making laws, but you don’t know the house policies. Disgusting
Republicans are always acusing Dems of being groomers, pedos, Devil worshippers. But it's always Republicans:  Trump Commerce Department official Adam Hageman has been jailed since November on federal charges of receiving and possession of child pornography.  He is accused of “sharing a child pornography video and commenting several times on sexually abusing children!” Randy Kaufman running for Maricopa County College School Board was arrested for masterbating in his truck next to a preschool while children were entering, exiting the preschool! Josh Dugger convicted of child sex abuse ran the GOP PAC Family Research Council!  Ralph Shortey former Oklahoma state senator served as Trump's campaign chair plead guilty was convicted of felony child prostitution and child sex trafficking!  George Nader a Trump advisor testified in the Mueller investigation plead guilty to child sex trafficking and possessing child pornography!  Ruben Verastigui a senior Republican digital ad analyst pleaded guilty to charges of having 162 videos and more than 50 images of child pornography! He said sexual abuse of babies was his "absolute favorite" has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for receipt of child pornography!  Republican Arizona Assessor Paul Peterson convicted of human trafficking brought pregnant women from the Marshall Islands set them up in his properties forced to give birth with no medical professionals and sold their babies for 40k a piece!  Roy Moore ran for Senator of Alabama Trump endorsed had 8 filed accusations of sexual assault of minors was banned from going near public schools and the mall. Doug Jones the Democrat won in a very red state because even Republican voters couldn't vote for a pedophile but Trump did! Matt Gaetz was investigated for child sex trafficking? His bff who cooperated was found guilty and went to jail! The DOJ dropped the case! The party of family values and law and order have trampled on the constitution and rule of law! The f*cking hypocrisy!
😂😂😂
Gonna turn TN BLUE
CALL     those 🤬 out THROW those 🤬 out VOTE     those 🤬 out ASAP  •
He felt entitled to do that, and it’s sad on all levels. He’s been doing this for years. Making people very uncomfortable, coming to work, with unwanted advances and etc. there’s 1000s of men and women like this all over the country. Goodnight
This disgusting guy should be in jail.
Great example of FAFO.
Bye
The only way to stop a bad republican is with a good Democrat.
the "three" still should have been expelled....and I'm a life long Democrat....one has nothing to do with the other.
Glad to see a non-Fox-like news channel ! A view from afar
Well, well, yet another self-righteous conservative, turning out to be a closeted, misogynist and sexual pervert!  It’s often those claiming Christian/family values while housing racist and anti-lgbtq undertones that end up molesting young kids, abusing women and children or are homophobic that are actually in the closet.  Conservatism is often a cesspool for grooming hypocrites that point the finger away from their own deviances.  Even in college throughout adult life, I’ve found most sex deviants to be from conservative backgrounds.  This story would be in the bin had it been Fox!
When you are a Republican you can just grab them by the Гμ§§ฯ
Now Cameron Sexton needs to resign.
The culture on self entitlement and hypocrisy strikes again. Good riddance to bad 🐷rubbish!  💯
How do these disgusting pricks think their misdeeds won't come to light, especially when they publicly act like evil racist monsters...
So many of these so-called "public servants" go into these positions assuming that it makes them untouchable, or immune to accountability. This is the kind of reality check they all need.
I guess the two Justins should have just sexually harassed the Tennessee House with their bullhorns to avoid being expelled.
How how about the one who peed on a fellow member’s chair?
and the leader also knew what was happening, and kept the secret.  he should also resign
What's the over/under before the death threats start coming into channel 5?
Republicans are the pedos and pervs they acuse the democrats to defend themselves, their base is so dumb they still believe in them
There is no surprise here. Republican lawmakers everywhere are corrupt souls. They have no moral compass, and they will never have; their parents did not teach them the concepts of honor, dignity, and shame.
seriously, is anyone actually surprised? one person? at all? republicans are the scum of the earth, these ppl have no morals
That's hilarious 😂 Always remember what they say about those who live in glass houses.
What’s in  anyone’s closet?👀👀👀👀
At the very least give him a tiny bit of respect for not running off. He even had to drink some water. There might be some sense of decency in him, so maybe we should... Oh hell no He's a piece of crap just like the rest of them. He may be a more respectful piece of crap, but a piece of crap is still one hell of a piece of crap. Take it on the chin just like he wanted to give it to those interns. What a piece of crap lol
White Sexual Predator! He should be in jail!
What a bunch of rednecks
No surprise......glad great journalism caught the POS. Republicans lack the capacity to understand ETHICS.
Hahahaha... He had to take a drink before his super creepy explanation.
Phil Williams stays in somebody’s face 😂
I have become convinced there is some mental defect in politicians…both sides…is it the mythical power they think local politicians gain…😂😂😂…”im better than you”…”do as I say not as I do”…reminds me of a blue dress incident…and the fact he won’t accept wrong doing…and then he says he would communicate with interns in the future…prison inmates need to get ahold of him…or a father of a young woman…I foresee this guy meeting Chris Hanson in a kitchen somewhere…and I would like to hear from the woman and her response…
What a fn hilljack this Campbell is!   Another republican doing good!
Isn't this what Republicans say non-fascist Americans do?
"Vulgar" behavior?  More accurate description would be "assault".  Why isn't he in jail?
FBI planted women and coercement. Usual behavior by the corrupt  Biden DOJ to convict innocent republicans without trial.
Not surprised by these lying, low-life, no intigrity, crime infested Tennessee State Republicans! Shameless!!!
We need a more nationalist party. The GOP aka the ghey old party are just progressives in red ties anyway. Stop voting for Zionist and Jewish Marxist as well. Support only people not afraid of being called or labelled buzzwords
Yeah, and I ride unicorns to work and have fairies help me get through my day. Living under complete falsehoods…….Hmmmmm. Hope the adage, “You Reap what you Sow” comes into context soon for you. Jerk.
This is disgusting. The GOP is once again showing us that the rules don't apply to everyone. Only those they don't agree with. WOW.
KARMA!!!!!!! They waved their hands, he waved something else.
What do you expect from hypocritical Qpubiicans, they think D Trump is hero.
Sexual harasser as well as racist means the Republican party will want him back.
If those conversations were "consensual" as he claims they were, then why resign?
Dems have more secrets, you don't investigate them!
Why haven't I heard of that on National news yet?
That’s how you do it, great job. Don’t tow any party lines. just find the truth and expose it.
Neither Jones or Pearson should have been allowed Back
How can they use Tax Payer money to investigate yet the amount  remain confidential? Bet that was the last interview he EVER gives. Not saying you can look guilty, but...
Oh how the turn tables.
LOL TOO FUNNY!!!! and I bet he was part of the  ones claiming Biden is a pedo, bye BYE Stoccy, dont beam those interns up LOL!!!!
he's CAUGHT as a perv & predator!!!! out off his job. NOW the 'criminal charges' NEED to happen ASAP.
Rebublicans are out of control.
Sexton needs to resign next.
Womp womp
This had some real "To Catch a Predator" vibes.
Why bring the Tennessee three into this discussion??  Totally separate.  This guy needed to go and he’s gone.  The Tennessee three need to go as well for what they did.  Make sure to investigate  them as well.
Perfect republican
KARMA IS MY HERO 😂😂😂😂😂
This is funny, we have a President who openly makes inappropriate advances towards children on national television sniffing there hair, kissing them on the face, inappropriate touching on the shoulder why isn't anything being done about that?
I wish my local news did journalism this well!
And heres the finding out.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is the republican way
So he harassed a 19 year old so badly that even his own party didn't think she was safe to live in the same building as him? But he's still apparently fit for office?!  One or the other, GOP. One or the other...
It's always pure projection with these GQP hypocrites. Railing about grooming and drag queens, all while they're the pervs doing the grooming.
wow! Great local journalism. Thanks to you Channel 5, for holding this "law maker" to account. This should be picked up by the National News. You are heros.
Old porky got caught!!
Fess up you oink. They were turned off - not turned on. Tennessee, you really are a cesspool.
ANOTHER victory for demokrats...
For every one roach you find, there are dozens behind the wall. Get them ALL OUT. Every accusation is a confession with these regressive fucks, makes it very easy to find who is a hypocritical piece of shit.
Fuck democrats
Tax payers' numbers/expenditures are not confidential!!!!
Funny how that with the MAGAt GOP that everyone else is making things up.
This sexual predator needs to be behind bars!!!!
Good job!
Those crooked hypocrites weren't going to do anything until this horrible liar was outed on the news! Just like the Justins said, they've been tolerating all kinds of improprieties going on and nothing was done, including one member urinating in another's seat!!!
Interesting.  Funny when those chickens come home.
What about the 3 insurrectionist
She went to return a wrench! Really!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂cambells soup
Secret process.....i think that says it all.  It was the best thing ever to watch that fool stammering and stuttering and he had a look on his face like he was soiling his drawers. Haha!
This is what happens when all you want is to have a super-majority based on gerrymandering, white fear, and secrets.
Such hypocrites!
Be like democrats. Never acknowledge wrong doing.  Blame it on others. Never apologize.
Excellent journalism. Exposing and eliminating monsters.
What person would be attracted to this sow?
Another randy, republican is Breaking News but not Shocking or Unexpected News! 1:24
This guy's a clown and the "Tennessee 3" are still morons
What a pig he is. Oink oink piggy piggy! He is a moron. How do people get this messed up? Is it taught by their parents? How could he assume that any person that he works with would find this kind of behavior “normal” or acceptable! At least he left. What a disgrace. Any behavior like this is way beyond normal behavior. What happens in adult films is not real life! Have a blessed day! Piggy piggy!
Because it's illegal to dress in drag in Tennessee, but OK to sexually harass teenage girls.
Haaaaaaaa haaaaaaaa!!!!!
Girls go crazy for him 😂😂 If that mug could talk. Who’s next?????
Oh my gosh , so many GOP hypocrites need to be exposed
It's always the Jesus humpers who are most guilty.
May all of them rot in hell
What about the black dude protester who become a state congress dude? Tennessee is a Joke 🤣😂🤣
Campbell is a harassing pig!
Give People AR Rifle to Feel Safe. NRA is making Trillions. and Their Board members and Executives dont carry Guns.
I knew from the start that he was a bigoted POS, and he proved it with his lies!  Glad that these journalists found out the truth and exposed him to the world for what he is.
Betcha he's not the only one.
The TN GOP are horrible.
Another lying Republican hypocrite. Smh
Damn… I guess everybody’s got secrets😂
Good riddance. What a bastard.
womp womp
Another Republican Groomer caught 😅😊
Good luck in that Good-ole-boy network
Nice people you have to represent you.
“Quietly found guilty…” what does this mean?
I love that reporter! Great job
Republicans are getting more and more disgusting every day. They show their hypocrisy at every turn. It's ironic he's okay with lesbians and it turns him on, but at the same time he wants to control and legislate whether people can be part of LGBTQ+ openly. I guess it's fine if it's secret.
Hahaha
Congrats on voting to expel those imbeciles and I am sure the sexual harassment is fake, it always is.
Aland of perverts
He looks like a thumb with a goatee!
Please spread this news! Bloody hypocrites all! Watching from 🇨🇦  Yall should be embarrassed but are apparently shameless!
The victim iß l lucky that she wasn't physically hurt. Old filthy mouthed fart. Face . Busted😅
The hypocrisy with these Republicans never seems to amazed me.
That guy looks like he's been sucking on an elephant's butthole
Another good Christian?
Lol how bout dat a hypocritical repugnican
He looks like a sexual predator, what a clown
So the focus is taken off of the true issue, which is the evil people who keep insurrections? Way to go Media as usual. Keep watching sheeple. Let's focus on the true matters in hand and bad enough sleepy joe isn't already impeached and his whole family arrested.
Yea a 19 year intern consensually talked about sex with this ugly fcker
LIES. I think Soros paid for this...
😮
Wow, what a surprise.😂
SURPRISE SURPRISE SURPRISE!!! Leadership knew and didn’t expel him but protected him. But tell me again how they care about decorum and children safety?
the delusion of this pig skin to man to think there is anything attractive bout himself! men like this can only get attention from prostitutes! and even they are disgusted!
The party of law and order..don’t follow through with that when it comes to their own
How shocking 😂 SMH
Shocker. Usual Typical Suspect his white privilege will get him off everything.
Didn't most people vote to get rid of the three clowns?
Republicans love to blame the Democrats for everything but when they look in the mirror at themselves they really get spooked. .....💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
For the right wing every accusation is a confession. This is a universal truth at this point. 🤣
Thank you channel 5, for pursuing this report. Grabbed her by the neck?? 100% predator
NOT A DRAG QUEEN. SAY IT LOUDER. I am willing to bet he went to church every Sunday.
So what? He got caught and they forced him to resign.  Case closed 🥱
Entitled, uneducated, unprofessional, unqualified, white....  The GOP.  Evolve hillbillies!
Goodbye🎉🎉🎉 feel the effects of the 13th!
He can go harass himself....
Let me guess.  He calls himself a Christian " conservative".  Bet he goes to church and sucks down coffee and donuts on Sunday morning.
Does he know he sounds GROSS, uneducated and dirty!
Who cares? Typical thinking... yeah, but look at what THEY did. As if what someone else does, in a non-related event, somehow diminished what you did. No, both of you are trash.
Their own racism got them caught LOL.
The Good ‘Ole Boys.🤨🤨🤨🤨
NÓ MORE FASCISTS
It was stupid to resign. They were in the right expelling them for breaking the law.
What a detestable creep..
Aaaaaahahaha. Loser.
Soon the courts will ban use condoms by men. 😊
Look how vigorous the media is when a Republican does something wrong. Yet you ignored Hunter Biden’s laptop. This earns you an unsubscribe.
Great job Phil!
Stay Tuned. More Republicons will be exposed.
That was the most awkward sip of water ever.  Gulp..fuuuuuuuuuuuuck. gulp.. fuuuuuuuck...gulp..
but he's still rich so he's got that going for him
People in Glass Houses  shouldn't  throw stone.Before you find a speck of dirt in your neighbors eye make sure there's  no log in yours
Hallelujah
Typical douche bag repubtard, you deserve it
Rocks glass houses…something or another 😂.
Garbage person.
Haha republicans are such hypocrites
Fake news
This is America White men get away with everything
IGNORE THE PROBLEM,, till someone exposes it. Standard operating procedure
A lot of women out there 🌎
Fuck you youtube!
But the Marxist nigger is a good guy.
Pig
the guy on the right in the first clip should be the one to resign too
Funny. We need to take out the garbage in america.
Say bye dumbass
Did your news team investigators look into the history of the three that were voted out for throwing hot coffee on lawmakers in an elevator on capitol grounds and beating on cars before they were in political positions?
Yet Republicans call Democrats groomers. Understand every accusations against a Democrat is actually a Republican admitting to their own dirty deeds.!!!
Omg he got some nerve all these pld unethical immoral jackasses in congress need TERM Limits nobody should make a career out of serving ever womder hpw wealthy they all get
Put fork in him he's done ✅ lol😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The GOP here in TN is absolutely out of control.
Rules are good for Thee but not for mee... 😁😁 (deny deny deny)
Real journalism! I miss this. So well done.
It so strikes me, time after time, when a Second Amendment supporter callously violates the Fourth, and how hypocritically this one claims a variation of the First, after he condemned a legitimate action under the First.  I am proud that several aspects of the First got pressed so effectively by persons of integrity. The irony of this whole situation is not lost. This is what happens, when the People raise their voices for what is right,  because the representatives chose to do what is wrong.  Power lies in the consent of the governed. The People no more consented than those two female people. Just for the record, I know the definition of a woman: a person with rights!
Laughing my ass off you f****** idiots had a clue you be dangerous, the red and the blue pill is what you need to keep swallowing. 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕 idiots you don't even need a napkin to wipe your mouth off.😂
Why on earth was this ethics panel "secret"?? It's obvious that since this guy is in public service and on the public payroll, he needs to be held accountable. I am going to guess that this will end in a lawsuit with the victims suing the state of TN - costing the taxpayers a lot of money. The Republican party needs to be held to task for why they didn't immediately get rid of him once this was brought to their knowledge
It's always the morons who scream the loudest about "Muh family values!" Who tend to be the most f***** up people.
Why are so many GOP politicians either sexual harassers, pedo-philes, sex-traffickers, etc…..?????
What a dumb fat clown.  Sadly most of his district consists of old trumptards and meth addicts.
I hate news stories that cover stuff like this.  There is no correlation between this guys pervy behavior and his voting to expel the other representatives.  They are both examples of bad behavior.  Trying to connect the 2 issues makes them both more confusing.  He is guilty of abusing his role as a member of congress by trying to expel the 2 reps, and he is guilty of being a scumbag who thinks he has any game with 19 year olds.  No need to make it one big story.  They are 2 big stories and deserve their own amount of focus.  The real issue is why wasn't anything done after he was found guilty until the facts of the complaint became public.  Who was responsible for discipline?  Why aren't they being held accountable for allowing him to remain.  Please keep shining the light here so we can watch the roaches scurry.  Just don't spend too much time linking things that aren't related.
Oh how rich is it that the those that call out the actions of others are in fact guilty of so much worse offenses….  typical Trumpies
When are they going to start reporting on all the democrats malfeasance
Where is the Nashville shooter's manifesto?
He should be arrested  and the intern should  file a lawsuit against him and the party he served  in . They should also  insist that he be evicted from the building they live in
This is republicans always everyone is worse than me.
😂😂😂
Standing up to gun lobby is a bigger 'crime' than sexual harassment? GOP is shameful!
I wonder what the stance on child marriage and reproductive autonomy is in this state... (not really). disgusting
It would be cool if dem were more serious about real sex crimes.   Lmaoh.  I'm not saying that what the guy did was right.    Imagining and actually committing sex crimes are different.   Actual sex crimes don't amount to shit any more.   Cause the u.s. is bunch of sick fucks.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  "Do as I say, not as I do" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sexual harassment of interns is nothing new.  Entitled men can't keep getting away with this behavior, but imagine how difficult it must be for the interns to speak up (especially these days) and this won't stop until and unless ALL women and men speak up!!
Repulsive man!
WOW!! Actual local news on the ball...
figures... just demons..only in it for personal gains.. you would think a scumbag would be more humble.
Great job. Now tar and feather good ol’ Scotty. Ladies involved, sue his sorry butt.
Lmao how's that "party of law and order" going now? 🤣
It sounds more like his boss, "the citizens of Tennessee" were preparing to FIRED the self righteous individual.  GOOD RIDDANCE
Hypocrisy. Projection. 🤦‍♀️ When they start using vague, stilted language to separate themselves, they are guilty of what they are accused of.
That’s the same guy that was defending the decision to expel the democrats .
Sexton is awful also.
A republican - how shocking!!
You know very well Channel5 wouldnt mention political standing if the dude was a democrat.
His question of”which direction do you want to me look at” is so classic. I thought Republicans supposed to have a family value..?
I am perfectly fine with weeding out the RINOS.
Scotty doesn't know! Don't tell Scotty! Scotty doesn't know!
LOL, not a drag queen again.
Seems like it's almost always a fat white guy sexually harassing
What Campbell aledgidly did to his intern was disgusting if this is true. That said, the other issue of the expulsion is not related in any way visible. It find it nauseatingly obvious  that the media seems to be attempting to conflate the two issues for purely political reasons to attack the constitution particularly, the second amendment. .
Good kuck him out even tho i Now identify as a Republican I NEVER will stand behind someone who harrasses their colleagues especially a College student
Wait so, a lawmaker who committed sexual assault was allowed the power to vote to expel other lawmakers for simply protesting?
Now place  private investigators on each of these corrupt legislators.
Well the three should be removed idk wht that has to do with his scandal though. Just because he voted on it? Kinda reaching to drag him through the myd more
Shades of tri Tridultry  Gingrich I have sinned before the Senate and my constituents
That good ole boys club..that’s why he didn’t get booted out.
Get all the disgusting criminals out of our government!!
At least he resigned on his own accord. George Santos would cheat in the election by lying his ass off AND sexually harass his staff and NOT resign.
this complainant should be writing fan fiction...oh wait....this is fan fiction. w a little erotica thrown in....huh.
Perverts. Karma bit him in the a**
Imagine having such a weak political party you need the entire news media to run interference all the time.
Surprised? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Another GOP male resigns due to his behavior. TN republican resigns. Scotty Campbell.
the get rid of the person stratagem; accuse them of sexual misconduct while right next door there is a trans clinic and someone is putting on a drag show...so are we really still doing this? any one buying this ish now? dems suck nothing is too low.
This video looked like a SNL or Chappelle Show skit.  LMAO.  I’m glad they outed these hypocritical pieces of shit.  He can stay on, while they expel 2 black guys for talking about gun violence.  This is rich.
This guy don't know most women are liberals mean they will get you if you don't follow their sick Ideology
He won't have to worry about talking to any interns anymore. He is disgusting.
Before he started speaking he said I need 5 seconds and then took a drink out of his thermos. I got friends from Tennessee but they don't talk as slow like he does. He looks drunk to me is it just me doesn't anybody else see this Did he have to take a swig or some Irish coffee or something before he could continue speaking. He's acting like it's in the same boat him gettingwritten not because he was sexually harassing peoplenext toa couple people that made some loud noise about a topic that's a very big controversy right now.  Being a pervert i'm praying on underage people allegedly to me is more disgusting and more vile than people raising their voice about a political issue.
Don't stop at Scotty Campbell.  There's plenty more of those scoundrels sitting in Tennessee's legislature to get rid of  !
Sure he did.
The 3 should be gone . And im sure their is more to this story like they are making it up because they work for the communist party 😅
This is a clear view of MAGA republicans!
dont know why because he was in the right. when are you people going to learn the democRATS aint nothing but a bunch of power hungry SOBs and when they get that power they dont know what to do with it. they dont know how to run a country and they sure as h&ll dont know how to run their  own state
This is what happens when you push back against communists.  Allegations come pooring out....all of a sudden.
Whenever the rep is on screen: Clown music playing*
The reporter must be related to Chris Hansen the way he was quoting the transcripts.. LOL
This boy Scotty has liar written all over his face, his guilt made him resign his job. Great reporting.
Understand when a man says consensual, understand it WAS NOT. And understand if they are being accused of inappropriateness, they’ve done far worse.
He's high on gummies, dudes got a cotton mouth.
@ 3:38 great defamation case for the intern (opinion from a lawnerd).
it's always like this. why is it always like this?
ew gross
Forced out from threats no doubt..
Perpetrators always have the most interesting (and the most ridiculous) excuses for their criminal behavior.
What they mean is they haven't even started an investigation.
The Tennessee guy got appropriately booted, the GOP guy resigned, good. The two are not related, except in your imagination.
Now it's time to follow  through with all their disgusting behavior ALL OF THEM in EVERY STATE EVERY STATE NOW
When it comes to, "rights", it doesn't matter whether it's a white, black, brown, or red man, men of all colors and religions will always find a way to oppress and rape women, all women!
The party of family values
Those “secret processes” that found him guilty need to be stopped. He was elected by the public, the public should be present during said processes.
The GOP is immoral.
So what? Doesn't mean a thing, those two little black racists are still scum.
I wish the victims would come forward and share. Probably forced to sign a NDA to protect the GOP. Clearly see why the GOPs are targeting women reproductive rights!!!😂
ALWAYS a Cuckservative!!
Secret ethics committee? Isn't that an oxymoron?
Ah!  republican sexual corruption rears it's ugly head again.  It is just like black mold  every time you move a carpet there it is.
Is there not a GOP politician guilty of, or yet to be found guilty of some crime?
Wow, what a shit show
KEEP INVESTIGATING CORRUPT SEXTON. GOOD JOB YOU GUYS.  KEEP IT UP.
God works in mysterious ways.
the way he has to pause and drink from his cup before thinking of a lie to say 😭😭😭 send this guy to jail
I absolutely despise these type of political SCUM!  Elitest, two-faced, hypocrites who constantly lean on their privilege to point the finger at others😠
Bro became what he swore to destroy
Trump got them think.its ok to do what, they want, judgement day,is over
There's no hypocrisy like right wing hypocrisy
I mean, are the majority of them immoral???
Of course.
If it wasn't exposed he would still be in power. The GOP is OK with this behavior as long as it isn't made public. Disgusting
Aint No Body here talkin bout how this Pore Repreezentatiff is a Descent Chritsian WHITE MAN and all he was doin was FELLOWSHIPPIN with them purtygirls --- you know readin bibel storeys and Singin Himms and stuff and we dont even Know how this Descent Chritsian WHITE MAN helped this purtygirl just like Mr Trump our God-Chose presdient took his Hard-Urned Money and helped that Windy Stormy girl with Work Cloths and Work Shoos and a Xursize Poll and Movie-makin sckool and such and the Evil Babey-Eatin Dimocratts just wanna Hurt a Descent Chritsian WHITE MAN who is workin hard to save the Soles of purtygirls!!!!!!!  AMEN&PRAYZE!!!!!!!!!!!
Scotty Cambell shame on u ,and Republicans on your Congress of racists of tennessee 😢😢😢
Every conservative accusation is a confession
Since we expect politicians to be so despicable, they always lose in these he said -she said scenarios.
Based on Campbell's definition of consensual, would he assume that there is a thing called "consensual conversation with children?"
Investigate Cameron Sexton next!
So weird that he had to resign and wasn't voted out for violating "decorum rules". Guess sexually harassing interns doesn't rise to the level of peacefully protesting gun violence...
While it doesn’t actually prove anything, this is the first time that I’ve ever seen someone asked a question and then nervously pause, ask for 5 seconds, then fumble around for his thermos to take a sip and then ask which way to face (as if it matters)  Again, it’s nothing in reality, but it sure looked like he was realizing just how F’d he was and trying desperately to think of answers that could then be spun in his favor  I still believe that if a comment or remark is genuinely intended to be good natured and that the other persons range of a acceptable conversation is fairly well known, that a little exchange can still be had, but if the accounts provided by the intern is anywhere near accurate, then this dude crossed that line, redrew it way far away and then crossed *that* line as well  Like if he thought the friend was attractive and was trying to be “playful” without going full creep right away, he could’ve done something closer to this…  *(sees intern and her looker of a friend)* Guy: oh hey, what’re you two up to?  Intern: my friend and I are just hanging out  Guy: well don’t have ~too much~ fun, now 😉 (implied “adult nature” undertone)  Intern: uh… right… 🤨  Guy (inner monologue): well, that wasn’t received well *AT ALL* , time to set interactions with her to “strictly business” mode from now until the end of time  ——————  Yeah he still would’ve gone to Creepville in that one interaction, but he could make the argument that “Don’t have too much fun” isn’t an inappropriate remark on its own and that the context wasn’t intended as it was received but that he recognizes that it was still received as it was… his position ~could~ be accepted if that was indeed a one-off interaction  He apologizes, promises to do better with not just what he says but HOW he says them and this likely goes away in short order  Though it sounds like this sort of thing happened more than a few times from the report made, and that there was *zero* chance that innocent remarks were simply being misinterpreted
They all got some hidden secrets,they all need to be investigated,pure devil 😈
Drop kick that loser and the other Republicans that knew about conviction, they are filth and deserve to be kicked out as well. And any Democrats that participate.
Proving once again, every Republican accusation is a confession.
WHAT ABOUT SPEAKER SEXTONS CORRUPTION AND HIS SEXUAL ADVENTURES. HE'S A LYING SLIME BALL HYPOCRITE. INVESTIGATE HIM.
HA HA HA!  Karma!!
Wonderful reporting! This helps bring to the forefront yet another example of how the GOP preaches high moral values and family values yet secretly protects another set of values. Within 3 weeks of the Nashville school shootings, 2 young Black Democrats are expelled because of their protests of gun laws that would help to protect everyone, their head of the bogus stop the steal riot in DC admits to sexually soliciting teenaged boys and Ron DeSantis passes a  bill that basically allows anyone to carry a loaded gun in their pockets with no permits. And all the while they are trying to make voting harder in any areas of the country where they feel threatened.
What you see is ALWAYS just the tip of the iceberg.   GOP hypocrisy knows no bounds.  This man disenfranchised tens of thousands of voters over "rules" yet clearly he's not a person who respects rules
The Republicans are so tired of winning so much. 😂😂.
Thank you Phil Williams.  😁😁😁
What party is trying to groom your kids?? Cause it's not democrats.... 👋
Funny how quick Karma comes back to bite you some times.
Interns all sleep with their bosses that happens at literally every company in America
Sexual harassment is terrible but.... Where is the PROOF?
If he didn’t think what he did was wrong he wouldn’t be trying to sidestep the comments and say it was a consensual discussion, only the women in question aren’t consenting to being asked personal questions or listening to his gross fantasies
Meanwhile, calling for an insurrection by the Tenn Three is quite all right.
If this doesn't end in criminal charges............
DAM HYPOCRITE
When do Republicans not have something to hide or cover up because they think they are above the law?
Well….BYE!
Yeah sometimes you have to remember to shut up and stay shut. What an idiot.
Well well looks like a grooming GOP puke that says everybody else has a problem and needs to be banned and condemned!! But looks like he's in a closet quandry! If I was a Rethuglican at some dayuum point I would stop pointing my wagging dirty fingers at everyone else and start to wonder maybe our asses are the problem causers and we need to STFU! These guys are the horniest freaks ever!! Why so suppressed??! Come on out and stop being so hateful. Shitee y'all some mean people because you're so mad. You so to everyone else who's just telling the truth and living the life you're denying you want to have. Kick that door off the hinges and come on out!
Who's next!
WHEN IS THE LIAR George Santos going to resign? AMERICA NEEDS HER JUSTICE!
Wow… the lows just keep getting lower.
I live in Nashville stop calling them the Tennessee three that’s a disgrace to Johnny Cash. What they did was wrong and that dude that looks like Malcolm X he’s a FACK as a three dollar bill
Disgusting hypocrisy that probably will lead to other unethical activities in the Tennessee legislature. Good riddance to this creepy SEXUAL HARASSER.
Why does this NOT surprise me. 😡
Well, the gop have proven time, and again, they don’t mind criminals amongst them. In fact, I kind of think they prefer it.  This guy is a creepy pervert.
cant wait till you people see who is gonna be in charge now. anyone care to share their own skeletons they have hidden in their closets? none of you are innocent, and you will all be judged the same. wait until you find out who your judges are.
All of them need to be investigated
lock up the GOP !
Whose surprised??
Hah!, Hah!, Hah!. Karma, baby, karma.
Great reporting! Support local reporters and journalists ✊🏼
Scotty Campbell, you're a hippocrate, you're a no account fool. Begone!
Those things are not connected lol
Hypocrites much? The Republican party, the party of racists and hypocrites!
The Republican white nationalist Christian fascist party is doomed. Think about it how many years is it going to take even in the best case scenario to vote and get all of these fascists out of office. These Christian fascist terrorists are the worst ever want to meet. They all swear to God and and country but there are a bunch of traitors and pedophiles.
He can't answer a straight question!He's a pig!🐖
Classic GOP trifecta. Racism, sexism, incompetence.
The Tennessee Three - 2 racial grifters, one Woke fool and the media that fully supports it .  Legitimate journalist not welcome .
Typical Republican
Maybe all the perverts in rep campbell’s district will reinstate him.
NOTHING NEW IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY Fascists think m they own our country! NOT BY A LONGSHOT! Stay Vigilant America 🇺🇸 Expose and Depose is working 🇺🇸 Thanks FRIENDS
Ha ha!!!!!!😂🎉😅😂
Well well well 😂😂😂
Lol, no way, hahaha
The GOP - Spin, spin, spin - "I think conversations are consensual once they start..."  🤣
Why are there "secret ethics panels"? How is an ethical violation like that not in the interest of the people? The only secret should be the identity  of those testifying.
You guys are a pathetic joke of a news agency. The charges were public and he was held accountable. Unlike most corrupt democrats. Most democrats are pedophiles.
And so it begins......Babylon is falling!!!!!
It's always a Republican caught in these types of scandals! 😒
Republicans are the kings and queens of projection
What a shock!  A Republican pedophile!
Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda chief said “acuse the other side of that which you are guilty”
The biggest problem I have is that he see’s NOTHING WRONG in his behaviour! Aged 19 is consentual but only JUST a legal adult in the eyes of the law,by a yr. He is a Law-maker turned predator in the workplace & HOMES
F-ing hypocrite!!!  Karma came swiftly! He was harassing a 19 year old. She can't even start her career or life with out a perv with is 🥒 out. Sick!
This is your taxpayers money Tennessee! Republicans at their finest! Vile creatures and traitors.
A member of the Republican party obsessed with sex?  HOW SHOCKING!!
Lol investigative journalism... from the mainstream media. Yea ok. Very convenient this guy gets mee too'd after holding some liberals accountable for their ridiculous actions. Definitely unheard of. 🙄
It’s always great news whenever traitorous , hypocritical Republicans get caught and held accountable for their crimes 👏👏👏!
I bet he’s got liquor in that big red cup. He carries it everywhere .  He’s a sleezy Scumbag hypocrite liar. 🤬
Never trust a man wearing a purse
That's the GOP for ya.
I'm surprised he's not holding a bible
“That’s not true””…(GULP)
So the leadership all knew about it and hoped it would stay covered up? Needs to be a few more resignations.....
All Democrats are full blown hypocrites 🖕
Of course he thinks he did nothing wrong
Not surprised.
The mindless bot report
Karma’s a bitch... but it can be loved.
Shocked another Republican being sleazy.
Well, Karma has come around and smacked him big time
Political parties specifically the republicans need to  do a better job in vetting their candidates for political offices.
This is how it works.  You cross them,  they will ruin your reputation, hunt down your family and your friends and ruin their lives as well...  All because you didn't play their game.  After it's pushed it doesn't matter if it's a lie.  It follows you the rest of your life.
This totally looks like retribution a totally fake charge that just suddenly came about when the angry irrational Negroes are kicked out of government legally! I feel sorry for Tennessee now you've gone woke and you'll be broke
To the gop leaders I think Dylan Mulvaney is looking for a new gig.
If someone is lying to you, you can best believe it's most likely a rep!
🤫💬....consensual adult conversation.  🧏‍♂️💬....Okay, give me 5 seconds.... 🙎‍♂️💬... what camera should I l👀k at? 😂😂💭....you can't make this 💩 up.
Wow, what a creep...can just imagine what's on his laptop
______ privilege
🐖 🐷 🐽 Man.
Typical Republican
e.tennessee in general has got a sexual addiction problem. But he did bring up an interesting point about workplace policies , that somehow bled over outside of the workplace.
Joe Biden stuck his fingers in Tara Reade against her will and he got a promotion, seems the Democrats have different standards.
Typial Republicans.  Free Tennessee from these scumbags..
Poetic!
Do Cameron Sexton next. He doesn't live in his district and accepts per diems for traveling home to Crossville... which he no longer does.
Just keep an eye on this guy. He's most likely on his way to go molest children.
The GoP has been attacking the LGBTQ+ community and drag community for years now saying they are groomers and sexually assaulting kids and minors.   Look up the data and you'll see that all the reports of sexual assault and harassment  actually are committed by right wing members.   So while they cry about drag queens hurting kids their own party is guilty of doing just that. Not only that but the kids who get traumatized from Nazis and Proudboys showing up to a book reading with mask and guns, yelling at parents and kids.   The right wing in America is fascist and hypocritical. They are a danger to democracy and they need to be stopped and stripped of power.
He violated policy but they didn’t kick him out because he’s w____
Old man giving girls drugged candy” Search this man’s Internet History “sounds like they found another Shorty.
why do people like this still exist?
Big surprise. You shine a light on vermin and they skitter.
I hope the interns are supported in their lawsuits.
Why that headline, voting the scum out was the right thing to do
These Republicunts have so many skeletons in their closet
😂
So they let the white congressman resign but they voted out the black ones…hmmmm…racist much???
I want to see a white board on ALL sexual misconduct on ALL political people. This is looking like a epidemic. I hope they ALL go to jail💙💜💚🇺🇸
Oop!
You're an elected official WHERE EVER you go.  You Muppet!
Ah, Republicans. You can dress ‘em up, but you can’t take ‘em out in public.
Same thing Joe Biden did to Tara Reede ? Where's the outrage their ???
Always a bad apple in a bunch. We have an administration full of them. It’s a sad day when insurrectionists get to cry “racism” and keep their jobs.
As a 66 year old African American male grassroots Republican and A president Donald Trump supporter, who resides in Macon Bibb County Georgia 31201, I will continue to keep President Donald Trump and our Republican Party and Constituents and our country the United States of America at large in my daily morning and evening Prayers taken from my 1789 Book of Common Prayer of the Protestant Episcopal church of the United States of America and the Authorized King James English Bible and the Knowledge that I can absorb from the Articles taken from the 28 volumes of the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica and the constant Refinement of my vocal, piano and organ skills in the Classical European Fine Arts tradition and the Negro spirituals in the A Capella tradition in my efforts on the Republican grass roots level here in Macon Bibb County Georgia 31201 to purify the sons of Levi from the political warfare waged against us Republicans by the Democratic party which is Lilluth in Disguise. This sexual harassment against my white Republican brethren in the Tennesee State legislature is a set up by Lilluth. These resources that I have mentioned in this comments is the only way to subdue Lilluth or that Dragon in the Invisible Empire. God Bless.
Karma!
Needs to be headlined on CNN
Did anybody see how red his face got when the reporter asked him if he said to her he was imagining they was performing sexual acts on each other so close to where he is. Hey at least we can always count on the Republicans pure unadulterated hypocrisy to be on full display as always. Karma it’s a bitch dude
Another sanctimonious and arrogant RepubliCon gets humbled.  In light of recent events in the Tennessee House, this is absolutely delicious.
But he loves Jesus.
So in other words expel the young black men for challenging the status quo, but keep the sexual pervert in place.
Karma is still intact I would bet there are more to fall.
A Republican sexual assaulting or harassing people? Oooo now why was I not surprised.   Oh yeah! the GoP has been caught dozens of times sexually harassing people. 😂 kick them all out the creeps
Sexton needs to step down
Great work Channel 5! 🎉
Thank you for exposing the rot in the Tennessee republican party. That man is a criminal sex predator and a member of the GQP. He’s one of those who tried to silence the voices of democracy in America in favor of the creation of a fascist dictatorship. He’s gone so far as to call transgender women groomers. Yet, he’s a groper, a molester, a stalker who was thankfully constrained from being a rapist by his own cowardice. Shame on Tennessee for coddling this monster. Shame on Tennessee for calling transgender people groomers when it’s the straight white conservative christian men who are the real groomers
WOW!
Pig
No surprise here
Typical Republicans. Cry fowl at the other party while doing a bunch of crime urself and assume the other team is doing cuz u are.   I hate politicians both parties but Republicans seem to be worse. Lots of sexual predators and violent domestic terrorist
What a jerk 😮
in the early 1980's the Republicans were caught in multiple cases of homosexual assaulting their interns it became a national story and the saying " How do Republicans like their pages " interns "      and the punch line was  " Bent Over "   the so called moral majority are some of the worst perverts around  . That is the reason they are so obsessed with sexual issues .
Hahahaha
Nice to see a scumbag shaking in its boots!
Carma knows everyone address.
Truth always wins.  Journalism at its finest.  Kudos to your TEAM!
The hypocrisy of these disgusting "so-called" conservative far right radical perverts who want to label the LGBTQ community of being a threat to children and society, while they're the ones who are the real predators here. All fascist conservatives can kiss my liberal gay ass!!
Ah yes, the Dems got to hit piece.  Fabricate sexual harassment allegations. This is not at all the machine going after someone that went against them, no. That would never happen.
Please keep up the accountability reporting. Great Job!!
They were so quick to act with the black members for minor inconveniences. Yet they tried to hide the much worse offense of their white member and he chose to resign of his own accord even though they KNEW he was guilty. Wondwr what excuses Republicans will make to justify it.
What are you saying that people who are racist and kick people out of the Tennessee legislature because of their skin color are you serious they didn't do anything to someone who's sexually harassing young women shocking that they don't have morals
Amazing how some people judge others but then their own secrets come out.  WOW!
Not a surprise
Republicans values are💩
Again the gop has shown how corrupt and inhumane they are.
Hypocrisy!
Thoughts and…screw that! Prayers and thoughts for this hypocritical legislator shouldn’t stop at his resignation-criminal investigations should follow. Hearing his excuses-ugh.
Well what do ya know? It wasn't a drag queen after all....
The speaker there is accused of screwing around on his wife openly with the wife of a lobbyist right?
The hypocrisy among Republicans is horrendous. And it leeches into every single aspect of life now.
Republicans are scum.
What a joke this is what GOP lies looks like really SHAME
This guy is a real pig,
Karma oooooh Karma.
Hypocrite
Republicans are the most hypocrites liars people of this world.
Okay but it still doesn't excuse insurrectionist but they must be (D)ifferent
The right are all rapists, pedophiles and secret self-hating drag queens.  Why do you think they're fighting to keep child rape legal?
Isn't that funny 😐. It's always the ones screaming louder has skeletons in his closet 😂😂😂
Why is this not a surprise. I mean no disrespect but seems to be a lot of this happing in the republicans party. Just my Opinion Thanks.
He’s a liar. He’s the one should be expelled.
IF he isnt guilty, why resign?  by resigning, he is admitting guilt
Good show.!
Sure, middle aged chud thought the teenagers were his friends. Ok, I have female friends, and I've never even considered asking them how many people they've slept with and I don't imagine them in the throes of passion with anyone. This dudes a scumbag and I hope authorities are looking into him, because he has a rapist mentality.
Irony thy name is GOP 🤣
Bullshit.
Party of law, and order in full bloom this spring.
NewsChannel 5.. Thumbs up!!! Keep after those sob's. Flushing those sorry ass republican scum back into the sewers they backed up from. Pheeeeeew!
Confidential my a**! TN tax payers paid for it. So they should be made aware of the full amount!
What a mess
The GOP is a dying party that will take ANYONE so long as they vote along party lines. Not the sign of strength they think. Mostly, the old GOP heads are hoping to stretch this out until they die, and then they don't care how many pervy skeletons tumble out of their closet.
OMG.. its all coming out now. One white, fat, disgusting, fake christian national GOP republican after another is being exposed for the white trailer trash they are. This is soooooooo disgusting to see the white race to be so overwhelmingly represented by these intellectual retards. And we think we are the superior race and religion!!!?? Pathetic!
Phil is great!  I love that the person resigned six hours after that interview.  So glad he is out, loved the way you confronted him with his own hypocrisy.  Great work
Karma is a b*tch! As the song goes "DIVORCE".
What an idiot. Why are you talking to a reporter?! Super idiot...why get on camera and lie. And Mr...?...you shouldn't have to be told to not harass women even away from work!!!  Jesus! Call a freaking sex chat line! I think people like this get off on knowing they are making a person uncomfortable. That's part of the game they play.
Typical .
That's what happen when you throw the brick and hide your hand the brick usually hits you back like a boomerang ASSHOLE
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 those gop always calling everyone else while doing dirty shit themselves...glad he got busted
All the secrets!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
The only thing shocking here is that a republican resigned because of a scandal that should cause them to resign. Normally that just gets you on some important committees in a GOP controlled legislative body.
LOL This huckleberry is slower than molasses during winter time.
What about Hunter's laptop and Joe Biden's child fetish?
These Republican betraying their oath of The Party of Family Values. Does suprise you? Not to me.
All of them lowlife racists need to be expelled! 😡
Of course
Typical of connedservatives.
Typical rapepublicans!
Disgusting by the horrible Racisits MAGA GOP in Tennessee all need to go as there are much more who have committed this and more crimes!!!!!  They ALL SHOULD resign or expel them all not actual people who are trying to bring awareness on Guns or Abortions!!!!!!   People of Tennessee need to wake up and vote them all out and vote for Democrats who will make a difference in your lives.
How convenient 🙄
Now if we o ly held the rest of the reps criminally responsible
republicans are Chester the molesters
The libertarians really did a number on the GOP. Their goal was and is to elect unqualified representatives to muck up the process and its working. l love it when these people expose themselves as completely unfit for the job like so many now in the GOP.
I don't believe in karma.  But sometimes I do.
Poor guy didn't even get a hug out of it. Put a quarter in it, because you played yourself!
#13 on trending, pro-Democrat bots flooding the chat….  Yep, YouTube is really pushing this anti-GOP stuff as the next election cycle nears.
Isn't it telligng that  these people are always REpublican,     you know,  the party who persecutes everyone else who isn't just like them.    The party who believes THEY are superior and if you don't look, think, act, and believe just like Them   that YOU are the bad person.                         Can we finally stop calling these people Republicans and call them exactly what they are... HYPOCRITES !
Just one more person who thinks he can do whatever he wants just because he has a little bit of power.  😳😡
TN is still paying, oust HIM ❗💯
Sexton? lol
GOP hypocrites. They not only tolerate racism but sexism as well.
It's a lot of predators and sex predators in the Republican party they knew that man was a sex predator just like Jim Jordan and gates in the many other sex predators and when you look at them you can tell they predators look at how many women over 20 accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment they all in the Republican and when I look at Matt gaetz and all the other predators and Donald Trump in them it just make me want to puke
Just your average republican fuck
The Whole Republican party is Full of Creeps and Criminals 👍!
those women and maybe more should follow up too...nothing new for the Grand Old Party
GOP, grotesque opaque pedophiles
What a creepy guy!
Why would I ever imagine that my daughter who landed this amazing opportunity to intern and advance her career need to deal with scumbags like this POS. I want my kid to not be harassed at her internship, is that so much to ask for? Guess he can’t find women his age so he has to harass young students
Why are you conflating these two stories. You sound like a Democrat? Are you?
Just because she's willing to have A conversation with you... does NOT mean she's willing to have ANY conversation with you
Dems will stop at nothing to dig up something about you when they disagree with you. They can coerce people into changing their stories and playing the victim. I'm just glad they threw those idiots out. Especially that phony with the fro pretending to be MLK. I find that offensive.
As long as the GOPukes like him promise to fight wokeism, they will always win election in a red stare
Somethings about this I am not buying. My guess is that these interns were orchestrated by Soros and they are using the "me too" garbage to take down another man. Women are disgusting!
Oh well. Nothing to see here. Just another day, another GOP sex nazi.
looks like the Brothers of Tenn. racist case just got stronger
Just because there are no guardrails... doesn't mean you should drive off the road!!!
The stall tactics is impeccable
It’s totally fine to be a predator in today’s Republican party, as long as you are also a racist. The “GOP” has had its hands around my country’s neck for far too long.
Oh ok! Take a look people, this is who opposes you and TheWOKE!
he so guilty
And still, the republican thinks he's the victim of persecution instead of actually doing wrong.  Such delusion.
he looks creepy
Republican projection of their own foibles onto others.
Sick gop puppy.
Oh how the Mighty and Perverted have Fallen. Can’t stop laughing. 😂
The intern loses her internship that is necessary to get a paying job later. Transfer her to another position that will increase her chances to get a good paying job.
So get rid of the black politicians but keep the rapist???
AND THE WINNER AT THE CHECKERED FLAG IS....!
Americans must vote out GOP everywhere
Good job channel 5.
White Sexual Harassment man no problem with him. Yet three members expelled for trying to protect Children from be Slaughtered is Wrong.  Maggots have more Morals then the WHITE GOP of Tennessee. An what about voters White older perverts racist.  Says everything. ABOUT TENNESSEE.
Great journalism Channel 5-- thank you for investigating.
Shocked, I tell you! Shocked lol
When you point your finger at someone, three more are pointing back at you....
529K views, eh?  Maybe good journalism CAN sell!
Bye Falecia
Then they say democrats are the abusers 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Republicans are a fine group law breakers and sexual predators
But they are the problem but they blaming the LGBTQ community and Drag Queens, Deflection at best🤷🏾‍♂️
Thank you for bringing this out to the public!!
This is fucking gross.
Excellent reporting.
I wanna hear say all this under oath. Anyone can see he’s lying through his teeth.
Typical
Crossed the line?  Gross. Is he fn stoned?
Another sick republican 😮
A RepubliKKKan just owning the Libs. They don’t legislate for the people, just for themselves.  Is all about culture war and nothing else.
Republicans are hypocrites
Shame on him...
So much for family values
The problem with this Republican is that he doesn't deny everything like Trump and his other colleagues. He should just deny everything regardless of its truth. The guy has zero self awareness. He thinks that women will find him attractive simply because he is in a position of power. 😂
Gawd, imagine being harrassed by that face with that accent, makes me want to barf
You will reap what you sow Thanks  Phil for bringing this out. Investigate  some of the others.
And yet nobody knows who Patrick Wajohn is.  He was caught with child korn but since he was a Democrat it wasn't important
A real class act. Total Slim ball that is A racist pig at the same time.   Make it make sense.
The fact that he thought his "conversations" were totally acceptable because they were both adults and not at work says a lot about him as a person.  He believes what he (supposedly) said would only be unacceptable if he said them to someone under 18 or while at the work place.  He is totally clueless that what he said was inappropriate no matter the age of the other person or the location.
Hmmm it’s almost like republicans are fucking horrible people and strictly anti-American.
I'm very confused. It is interesting that everyone bypassed the fact that apparently the head of Tennessee Congress pissed on somebody's seat because he was upset at something a fellow colleague had done or some disagreement and it is common knowledge. He pulled out his penis in a public building to commit a vulgar act against a colleague in retaliation. How is this going unsaid in media right now?
Plus he a Karen.
This reporter is on it. That God for reporters of integrity
Nothing to see here people, decorum was not breached. Thank God no breach of decorum.
Wow. Another Trumpthuglican charged with sexual assault and/or sexual harassment? Color me shocked. 🤣
Such as an old goat
Lmao Republicans are criminals
So that’s how those republicans want to protect children and teenagers huh….?! By banning books yet having sexual fantasies about a 19 teen yr old. Just wow.
Unfortunately these Banana RepubliKKKans will always be the super majority in red states like Tennessee. Is just like a 3rd world dictatorship, except you people get to pick your tyrants.
If you're worried about them getting your "good side", you don't have one.
Its not even surprising anymore, republicans dont represent their constituents they never did GOP are corrupt to the core
The Dems made Lewis Black resign and the Reps ignore it u til it gets slammed into their faces.These women and men need to sue  the pants  off  of them then maybe they will act not wait to see if it blows over.
How can they all be so dumb?
Thanks for the good reporting. I'm sure there is a ton more to find out. Absolute power and all.
Answered in a true Lying Republican faction, not surprised, very sick people
HOW MANY SECRET CRIMALS ARE IN GOVERNMENT?
Is that whiskey in his little bottle?
They all have skeletons in their closets, some they keep as trophies. Bring them out for the world to see.
Ha ha Justice, get the rest of them as well!!!
GOPocrites 🖕
He didn't dig the whole big enough
The ones with the loudest mouth are gulty. He nasty, 19 yrs old?
Yeah, thank you so much Phil. Keep after it.  Where there’s smoke, there’s fire 😮
RepubliKKKans values, go figure. Do as I say, not what I do. That’s why they are known as Banana RepubliKKKan.
a "adult" conversation isnt "consensual" just because you open your ignorant mouth and spew filth on a TEENAGER with complete disregard, lack of invitation, or even reciprocation. absolutely disgusting. hes lucky it wasnt my daughter. the fact that he wasnt expelled or even removed from committees is almost unbelievable, but we know how the GOP operates.  party over democracy, decency, and common sense.
GOP MAGA terrorist Taliban considers protecting sexual predators far more important than protecting children from death by gunfire. These are their priorities and they will not change until forced to change.
TN is really making themselves look bad in front of everyone. And I'm from southern Ohio so not far away but TN seems super corrupt
WHY is this ethitics panel secret?????
Sexton should be next
What??? Republicans are bad people??? Color me shocked.
Republicans - rules for thee, not for me.
Is this the representative who urinated in a colleague’s chair?
The Tennessee three are still Insurrectionist's.
We won't expel a Republican member for sexually harassing an intern, covering it up, and making Tennessee taxpayers pay for the victim to live in a hotel (punishing HER instead of HIM).   But we will expel Black Democrats for listening to and advocating for their constituents.   Who, us? Hypocrisy? NEVER, you liars! 🙄
What a disgusting individual 🤮
These Republicans weren't even gonna do anything 2 Campbell until they knew it was gonna go public! All of them are hypocrites of the worst kind🤔
You just know he wanted to run when they confronted him, but he's so fat he'd only have made it 10ft before he collapsed.
REPUBLIKKKANS =.  T A L I B A N
I hope more people to vote for more democrats to balance out power with Republicans. There has to be balance in power between two parties.
Fascism by any other name is still fascism. BOYCOTT !!! Vote more democratic in 23&24 and allow evil to die a peaceful death of non-support.
Good riddance!!! Speak out!! Tell the truth and shame and cast out the devil!!! Get these people the heck out  of here and out of seats of power!!!
How GOP voters think about their candidate, I wonder. I bet he is also a “Christian “ too.
Poster child of Republican behavior
Oh, the boomerang effect in real-time 😅😅😅
None of this shit should be done in secret, how disgusting are those leaders that kept this under wraps!
The republicans party in Tennessee are cowards,
This is some old school journalism
"Consensual conversation"! my eye.
That wasn't harassment! That was assault when he grabbed her by the neck.
I thought GOPers were against homosexuality…..😂
What's good for the goose is good for the gander. 🤔
Just following Trumps GRAB them by the Kitty POLICY...lol
Hypocrisies at its finest,  not willing to vote him out  knowing that he was under investigation for sexual harassment charges but willingly denied the two young men the same privilege  of due process. Thank God for real journalism.
Sexual harassment,  trafficking, porn, child labor,  homosexuality, grooming, abuse of child wrestlers and athletes, rape, transgenders and whatnot and whatever. You name it and these pious, holy and oh so Christian better than thou GOPS just forever get caught out doing these very things each time they want to ban or call them woke. Try reading the Bible guys or at least don't hold it upside down for photo shoots. Give us a break. The majority of Americans ain't stoooooopid!
This is called blackmail. Do you notive how the story moved from what the Dems would describe as an insurrection if it were people from the Right? Because this man stiod up for what he felt was right, they throw this to the media. Why didn't the media already report on it since there was already a conviction? This country is in big trouble because people cannot tell the difference between real reporting and propaganda.
wow never thought id sub to a random local news stations youtube channel, especially after just seeing one video but DAMB you got me
Look at him.  Listen to him.
The effin irony, u sick mf! White supremacy  at its best
So despite being found guilty, he insists these were just "consensual conversations". Welcome to Family Values, Republican Edition.  And, of course, he blames the 19 year old woman he preyed on. Also typically Republican -- women are objects that have no rights,
The pious GOP acts so sanctimoniously until their crimes are outed.  The mantra of the GOP is lie, cheat, and steal.
😂😂😂😂😂. Good job
Sick fing guy but this is the quality of the average republican lawmaker. Blame it on bud light and tranny shows.
Nah nah nah nah  Nah nah nah nah  Hey hey hey GOODBYE 👋🏽 your are a disgusting human this is why they can’t get any work done…look at his dumbhass now trying to get young black decent people expelled…just 🤢
Freak Out Tennessee!! hahahaha
4:40 His error was in grabbing her by the neck. If the intern was GQP, any grabbing should be of her 😺
Lord, I thought but was speaker douchebag was the one who resigned!! 😠😡🤬I’m disappointed but I’ll take it! For all you voters out there, good rule of thumb: Republican equals closeted gay person, or pervert, or abuser, or a liar, or just basic a$$#@le!!!
Typical hypocrite.
Funny how Republicans, the “party of family values” again and again are tangled in sexual scandals. Oh, it’s beautiful how Karma can strike.
Ok.  First - this guy is a turd.  Regardless of party - if you think one party is better than the other - you need your head checked.    Second - this guy is a turd.  What moron in today's world - who is in politics - would put themselves at risk and expose themselves by something with trying to even do something so trivial as flirt with interns?  Your friend today is your enemy tomorrow.  Everyone has an angle - the intern, the politician, etc.  He needed to resign just on accounts he was stupid.  You're there to represent people in your district - do your job, or go home.  If you're pent up for a sexual relationship - I completely get that - keep it out of the office dummy.  Third - the intern - she's a moron.  So he sexually harassed her in her words - and then after he's done this inappropriate behavior she thinks that's a wise move to drop something off at his apartment?  She was building a case on him.  She's a turd.   Quit or get another job, or tell him that's inappropriate to be dropping things off after hours at his apartment, that she can bring it to the office or work... she was looking for something more to take place to file a charge.    Fourth - the Tenn. Three are turds.  They needed to be expelled.  Not reinstated, or one stays etc.  I hate both parties - they're equally scum in my eyes - but one side has gone so radical that it makes it literally impossible to support that party - Democrats.  I'm all for checks and balances with no one side having a lopsided control... but this extreme radicalism and trying to overthrow state government and causing an insurrection at the capitol - has no place.  In summation - they are turds.
Karma is a bitch, isn't it.  Tried to discriminate and expel black lawmakers for doing nothing wrong and ends up getting expelled himself when his own wrongdoing came to light.  _This_ is why we can never give up the fight no matter how badly the MAGA come crashing down on us.  Because if we persevere we can take them down; they're bullies but once you stand up to them they become nothing.
The fact that they Republicans  covered  it up,  is the most disturbing part.
The Republicans are sexually  perverted ...morally bankrupt.....financially corrupt and lacking a shred of decency or honesty or empathy....nor have any ethics... They SUCK basically
What a bunch of inbred trash. I would have paid $ to see them chasing him and his fat, sloppy a$# on his big brothers church clothes trying to get away.
If he was found guilty then why is he denying everything?
Please explain to me the concept of an "adult consensual conversation"...  if you're saying something I don't want to hear, but  don't walk away - can that be construed as verbal assault?  His line of argument is as silly as that question, in my opinion.
His cup signal to the crazies is what you all need to look out for as well.
And how in the world do you try to tell the public that you didn't know that things that you do in your private life will affect your public job. Even people at Target can get fired for things they do outside of Target. Why do politicians who should have more accountability than the average person always think that they have a less rules to follow than the average person with an average job?
Honestly surprised any Republican resigned after getting caught doing something heinous. Conservatives usually double down and start screaming at you when you catch them being horrible.
Expose all those republican inserrectionist that wants to destroy our goverment.
Oh boy the plot thickens 😂
So TIRED of "boys will be boys." Sadly, there are SO MANY men who think they are ENTITLED to sexualize and objectify women, especially young women, at work or otherwise. More healthy role models, please! My hope is that exposure like this - especially a mature man confronting this type of individual in the manner that he did - will spark the need for change.
What a sleazeball.
LMAO, So he’s a groomer? Who’da thunk it!?
Lawd!!!! 😂
What a piece of work. The high morals of these government officials.
You don't get to walk up to a woman and ask her whatever obscene things you want and then say it was a consensual conversation because you were both just conversating
Excellent reporting showing hypocritical double standards... if you can consider a first amendment protest and sexual harassment even remotely equal.
Always seems to be the ones condemning other people that turn turn out to be those most deserving of condemnation.  😂😂
oh the decorum though...!
Who’s out now ya creep!
This little Fat Bastard thought he was privileged to act like a pig. Tennessee 3 broke decorum but, this piglet wanted sex. How did he think he was capable of moving his gut.
I truly believe this GOP still believes he did nothing wrong. Even every word/actions mentioned are true.   GOPs feel entitled, and believe there are 2 sets of rules, one for them, one for all others!  Scary, but a fact!!
Justin Jones-/Pearson.... You both have a great futures ahead of you. Remaining articulate, you kept cool, focusing on the real prize & goal. As voices for all us, G-d speed, and much success!
Your typical gop mentality
REALLY???
Wow, I don't live in the area but I am so proud of this reporting. Great job!
What a shock!
Wow! What a system! Secret disciplinary proceedings, he's found guilty and they don't kick him out. Yet, he votes the Tennessee three out for "poor decorum"! Bunch of damn lying hypocrites. What a joke!
The journalism here was excellent.  This man is totally clueless..
Let's go BRANDON
Power corrupts.
Family values at their finest.  Sexually harassing racist predator from Tennessee.  MTG finally coming out with the man she cheated with while married to another after both conveniently divorced their spouses.  Santos proposing to his male teenage lover while in a sham marriage with a woman.  Way to go, GOP
The symbol on his cup says it all. Who missed that, flash he displayed.
Glad one American Taliban Fascist Republican resigned due to the fact he got caught in his sexual harassment.  I'm sure he was quite sure he thought he could get away with it with the enablers of other Fascist Republicans!!!
This is all Republicans! They are pedophiles and rapists!
Sigh. Not surprising. Sexually harassing interns (plural), no expulsion. Protesting the gun deaths of children? You get thrown out. Unbelievable. The guy is disgusting. Chasing a 19-year-old. Your tax dollars at work.
Oh republicans... you bunch of pathetic little bitch pedophiles. No surprise here ;) keep using nazi tactics, by all means, accuse the other side of your own crimes!
Conservative voters, Where's your outrage?
What a despicable man!
I did not I repeat, I did not sleep with that young intern.  LOL
If you've ever heard anyone lie ever in your life you don't have to watch his interview more than 10 seconds to understand he did everything they're saying he did
I knew that something like this will happen
Dirty dog... Smh
Sexual harassment = republican party
These are conservatives in general. Let’s not pretend this is a unique case. It isn’t
Ahhhh MAGA you are imploding !!!!!
One down and the rest of the Republicans needs to resign
😂😂😂 BUSTED
What a dirty man. There’s no way he didn’t say all that 😂 I believe it. he is giving max creepy vibes. Of course he thinks he didn’t do anything wrong! 😂😂😂
What a lying, short, fat and stupid incel.
PURE WHT PRIVILEGE!
Lol. Typical.
Maybe you can investigate all Biden scadalls 😂oh wait dont investigate a democrat😂
OK.  One down.   Still plenty to go.
You should have shut the fkuc up, and this would have never been know.
The three racist Democrat insurrectionists belong in jail!!!
I'D RATHER YOU REPORT ON THAT MALE SLUT BIDEN SELLING OUT OUR COUNTRY TO CHINA. HE'S ON THEIR PAYROLL, WHY DON'T YOU DO SOME INVESTIGATING?
Republican leadership is such scum.
Another typical Republican corrupt and criminal.
If it is proven, he in fact was behaving inappropriate,  he SHOULD resign and face accountability. I'm a conservative and we need to stop blaming the opposition. BOTH PARTIES HAVE BAD PEOPLE!! PERIOD. SURELY WE CAN AGREE ON THAT. We need to come together and stop our elected servants from abusing power and privilege...on both sides.
Thank you for unearthing this. (I shoulda known the Republicans were just trying to run distraction when they expelled those Democrats...decidedly *not white* Democrats at that, just to make it worse.) This is the kind of journalism we need. Not afraid to look a politician in the eye and say: "You've done something wrong. Tell me. *Tell the people.* Admit to it. The people deserve to hear your admission of guilt." Shame the politicians, shame them all, when they break the rules (and especially laws!) like this.
Meanwhile it all started with a transgender that killed six innocent people and children in a Christian school. See, whenever just as dirty as Democrats, Democrats are going to beat at the dirty deeds. However, since have the premeditated beliefs of never let a crisis that create ownselves, go to waste, let's see how God uses it ALL, because better believe it that does, every time, and in all kinds of different types of ways.
Investigate ALL political and religious leaders for sexual abuse!!! Party doesn't matter, but the GOP has the MOST of them. Makes sense. Restricting reproductive rigts and going easy on sex abusers. At least he is trying to be respectful and answer the press questions
His explanation is beyond stupid.
If they dig deeper there is more than that in that Tennessee house! Believe me, hypocrisy at its finest.
Get his sloppy ass. Smfh
What a surprise
Just another Rep. IDIOT.
Gross little creep
Oh yeah one of the outed senators even talked about him as he was expelled. 🤣
Of course he did.  This is the Trump GOP - crimes in every corner - all while blaming President Biden. lol.  Groomers in SD and now Tennessee, NOT SURPRISED.
Typical GOP.   From the point of view of someone outside of the US, they only recruit horrible people.
1:39 He's got Bourbon in there.
The new republican party signs up to be a “Pubic Servant,” not a public servant.
EXCELLENT reporting!  😃
And these scum had the nerve to expel those 2 guys for ‘decorum’.
In fil traited
If this keeps going, it will just be women left running everything because all the men can't keep it in their pants.
Newschannel5 did away with a newsdesk so viewers would see short skirts and legs. And then they have to stand there talking about sexual harrassment? Ironic!
😂😂😂 clowns 🤡
Maybe instead of trying to protect kids from trans people, we should be protecting them from the GOP
Pre-requisite to be a Republican office holder - “Gotta be a freak!”
And they worried about drag queens being predators…
Hold his feet right to the fire? Great interview.  Local news is so much better than national. Real questions with follow-ups.
So, the party of "family values" - the party that imposes its values on others, covers up egregious misbehaviour by its own. Now there's a surprise. Props to the journalists. Disgraceful behaviour by the GOP.
I never understand why these Repugnant candidates run for the Conservative Party, especially when they are aware of what their sexual attraction is!  I know it's about "power" that comes with the position, much like Priests, it's pretty much the same!
Check out "sexual harassment" by axis of awesome
Family values party . Vote blue .
I swear  Republicans are the biggest hypocrites on the face of the earth
Again the biggest law breakers are the law makers
rEpUbliCaNS aRe tHE fAmiLY vAlUEs pArTy
Racist hypocrite
This is how conservative Republicans behave behind close doors.
Why are so many Republicans disgusting?
If he was a Democrat it would have been swept under the rug like Biden having classified documents
This guy is "completely off the morality grid."  He deserves no quarter.  It's clear that he's just a dirty older man who is using his Political Power to attract what he mistakenly thought was some "easy trim."  Wrong move for an immoral man who voted to expel 2 out of 3 of his colleagues for actually supporting their constituents.  Another "lech Republican."
From the GOP thats not shocking.
I want to know what he's chugging cause his got that same mug on the floor. FYI - not being a creep isn't just a "work place policy".  Thank for exposing the hypocrisy.
He needed a sip before he spoke 😒
A consensual conversation? Can lead to some pretty fine lines. And guard rails? What is that? An excuse to be practically a pervert?
Excellent reporting thank you guys 🎉
In other related but deflecting news - Rep Justin Jones was arrested for attacking white legislators in 2019. Are we gonna have a pissing contest to see which politicians are bigger sacks of shit? 🤡
"Let me just get 5 seconds" lmao
Also, thanks for hitting this guy with facts and honest questions like a true professional..zero bias and no intent to smear this man's character..just cild hard honest facts!
He is disgusting 🤢
Republicans are some sick puppies.
If it were a Democrat, it would be covered up and it would be called a conspiracy theory. Look at Joe Biden, for example.
Another republican trash hypocrite
He's a pervert and a marijuana user.
Ha, a nice bit of reckoning for the fat Nazi
This is so refreshing!  Get these sick phonies out of public office, and bring truth to the public.  Thank you, fine journalists.
GET A LAWYER!!!!
Funny thing reality show which party is full of pedophiles, groomers and liers.....guess what... .its not the dems.
No accountability?
Funny,that reporter literally just had to step out the front door of the News 5 studio to get that interview.
Did you see that gulp after immediately denying what he said? He admits he has an adult conversation, why doesn't he just repeat what he said??????
This from the same person that tried to get rid of 3 elected officials trying to make fair and honest change within our communities in America....leave it to the Republicans!
😂😂😂that fat slob is a perfect example of a REPUBLICAN!
So creepy. Typical GOP
Oh GOP you are a never ending source of both disgust and amusement.
Can't have friends of the same gender with infidels in the same vicinity
Oh biting him in the ass….. typical Republican
Glad to see where Republican priorities are these days lol
Ex Rep Campbell is another vagina mullet sex addict, just like Jason Miller.
Typical MAGAT Republican . Racist. Sexist and homophobic.
Channel 5 reporter dude achieves heroic status BRAVO! say his name: Phil Williams that's how you make America great again (or at least make it better)
TN GOP members fear no one. Shameless.
Why are all fascists also sexual predators ?
Two wrongs dont make a right..this douchebag and the 3 other tenn 3 douchebags all broke rules and shouldn't be in their positions
Oh yeah, they were paid. Funny this never came up before. So the BS begins now..
I didn't know I was supposed to have character and morals when I'm not at work. WTH.
Nice work News 5
When he drinks the water…😂😂😂
Sexton didn't act because he is also a criminal, and they protect each other!!! I hope Sexton is next to resign or I hope they get him and he goes to jail...as he should!
Damn. Quick karma on his fat ass. Maybe that'll knock some of the fat of his big head
GOP’s mantra is “do as I say, not as I do”
Isn't  it amazing how they tried TY o hide this pervert.
If you run a fine tooth come through the republican party you will see that it is BRIM FULL of fat currupt TICKS feeding off the hide of America.  Basket of deplorables
I can tell you, NO 19 year old woman would have a conversation like the context mention with a man his age, EVER!
If he has anymore sexual conversations with college aged interns he will record them from now on?!?!?! So he learned nothing.
Karma is a B***ch ! Absolutely Beautiful! 🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣❤️
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Karma is a vindictive bitch and I love her 😁😁😁
Wait... tough republicans were gods servants?😂😂😂
LOL!!!  😂😂😂😂😂😂
So now do Sexton!
Then that makes 4 that deserve to be out.
He was looking so obviously guilty, it was a shame.
It doesn't seem to dawn on him that he crossed lines. Typical.
Guilty of violating the sexual-harassment policy, and yet was not expelled! Clean the house!
good
He’s a catch! Lmao!
What goes around comes around 😂
I'm glad this happened so that this disgusting behavior could be exposed. But he should have been forced out for violating the First Amendment rights of other law makers.
Yeaaaa. One less republican
Always the guilty one.
What a creep. Good riddance.
Wow. A Republican resigns for being disgusting. Hope it becomes a trend.
It always seems the GOP projects on the Democrats. Mainly because they don’t want their transgressions and failures to come to light.
Sexton knew it before the TN3 were expelled. These schmucks all need to go.
He is right republicans can do no wrong
WHAT A PIG.
You mean like President Biden did, oh right he wasn’t charged or investigated
What a little turd!
Good
Scotty Campbell was found GUILTY by a *secret ethics panel.* Why isn't this public knowledge? He -is- was a public official.
Typical Republi-con ....
The universe just reminding us who the true groomers are. ~
Whomp whomp!
C'mon local News doing their homework!!! This fool is done.
typical RethugliCON    vote BLUE as if your life depends on it. If you're a young woman it very well may.  🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Republican swine...only good one's are like Lincoln, resting under concrete.
This guy is a pervert. SMH. I am so glad that she reported him. He is just nasty 🤮. Good reporting. Excellent journalism. I am so glad that he resigned. It is scary to see that we have such in office impacting our lives.
I think they should have put him up for a vote. Parade him around like they did the Democrats that were fighting for justice and representation. Make Republicans vote him out. Now they get to coward out and not have to show their true colors.
Great investigative journalism
When your digging holes dig one for yourself. Such a liar.
Oh, the GOP… A true Bastion of morals and values! So glad that THAT‘s the party that has made it its goal to tell the entire country what to do and how to behave. Truly, these are the people who‘s standards we should use as a baseline!
His hypocrisy is breath taking
Do you see it now?  The power of journalism?  These Tennessee Republicans wouldn’t have done a thing unless journalists broke it. Journalist of the world stand true to your ethics!  You can save the world!
I'm not surprised..smh
Lol😂😂😂😂 , hold up just a second.!!!😂😂😂: Didnt exoect that, traitor pedophile.!!  We need to watch him . Consentual conversations.??? Sure.
This was probably the cringiest (sp?) confrontation I have ever seen on camera.
Because Cuomo’s much lesser accusation was so unpublicized. How was he to know? Poor man. A victim of soycomstance.
Karma is a bitch
The other Politicians who were complicit should be physically thrown out of their position.
God is exposing all corruption in this season. Brace yourselves.
Wow, so ethics only apply when you’re at work. So it must be okay to sin, as long as the sin does not occur within the church property. Thanks for the info.
Refreshing to see a politician who sucks at lying.
Clearly it wasn’t consensual big man, it’s the cognitive dissonance for me 🤦🏾‍♀️
Another great job 👏
I respect the fact that he spoke to the reporter.
Prledophiles...
Ya don't say 🤡
😅 no surprise there
Republicans are Deplorable!
Remind which side are the groomers again🤔
He had a "perfect" consensual conversation.
Fatso got caught. The gop  loves to crack down on  transvestites but hide these pedophiles in their ranks. Sounds like the Catholic Church again.
How is one “secretly found guilty?”
Get again Republicans say and believe, do what I say not what I do
First Amendment is a glorious feature
Straight up rockstar investigative journalism.  Every one of these goons pulling these partisan BS all turn out to be monsters.
Cameron Sexton needs to immediately hand in his resignation, too: ▪︎ Fraudulent expense reports for mileage from his Crossville "home" when he actually lives in Nashville with his wife and kids ▪︎ Not living in the district, he is supposed to be representing ▪︎ Sleeping with a married lobbyist - conflict is interest ▪︎ Cheating on his good Christian conservative wife and children
Yeah.    I can see woman just falling over themselves around him. Mr. Stud. Even in the comfort of his own apartment he has no solution to gun control.
Stop pretending like you don't know it's because the state you're in is full of voters who are racist and racially biased who benefit from the system of racism. And the reason why is very simple many whites in the souths are dumb so they have to have an unfair system for their useless kids to have a shot.
ALL republicans are creeps.
He deserves what happened to him.  Disgusting and dirty human being
Love to see it! Tries to expel people over decorum and behavior having done this — makes sense smh 🤦🏽‍♀️
Predators and pedophilia Marge is right but she just need to incorporate both parties but l must say the Republicans are in the lead right now
Get ALL blacktivists out of our Government now!
Hmmm Decorum vs Sexual assault!! 🤔🤔🤔
Republican leadership.  Yes, real American values. God bless American journalists.  Anita Hill was Clarence Thomas' secretary before his SCOTUS appointment, and he insisted on telling her about porn movies he'd seen. She told Congress and was ignored, and insulted.
One would think we have no policies if behavior and actions dont matter if your blue.
Every conservative accusation is a confession, we have seen it time and time again
I give him credit for standing there and facing the questions. Most people would shrink and run away 😅😅. He stood his ground and took his butt whoopin like a man😂😂😂
Good for him… GOD don’t like ugly…
all republicans are child groomers and perverts just like They say
[gym-towel jordan] should be feeling butter-flies in his belly right about now...
Karma!!
I wonder if we will pay for this with jail, jut another gopig
Gee! Always when you point a finger at somebody you forget how many fingers are pointing ing at you!   This is a bunch of bull!  Specially from those that think they are holier than thou!
Republican "values" at its finest here.
Sick af, ripping our country apart for profit. Where is the story showing the tennesse three lying and manipulating people for racial violence.
And another one ☝️   Phil Williams takes on the governor, senators state reps! Tennessee is a messed up place!😟
What a perv!
This guy was kept in positions lmao. Republicans are pedos and rapist.
Good work Channel 5!  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
found guilty of sexually harassing at least one legislative intern, likely two, by an ethics subcommittee
This is what the Republican party is made of disgusted old white men who live from their groins and projecting their perverted thoughts into others while pretending to be appalled by someone else's non perverted action let's not forget the female counterparts in this group of perverts I'm glad they are finally getting caught thanks to their  own stupid idiiotiocy keep up the good work repubs maybe we can clean the swamp at this rate.
Just because you have a conversation does not make it consensual. It was obvious by their reply that they were repulsed by your comments.
Tennsee was a state, once
Hold him criminally accountable. What a lying, despicable, morally bankrupt individual. He’s Disgusting, and anyone who believes otherwise, should ask themselves “ how would I feel if it was my daughter, mother, or sister that he was subjecting to his abhorrent behavior???
WHERE IS MATT WALSH OUR OUT OF STATE EXPERT ON SEX? WHAT IS HIS EXPERT OPINION!!!! I MUST KNOW NOW!!!!
Great job investigating this! The plot thicken! Da da DAAAAAA!!!!
Haha keep'em coming!
Surprising that such a well dressed guy would resort to harassment o.0
Lol
More Party of Family Values
Tennessee is a joke
Great job of journalism.  This is what I think of when I read "Freedom of Press".
STAY WOKE YOUNG FOLK! You have been called for such a time as this to HELP SAVE THE CHILDREN!
Nothing new from the gop.
MAGA is full of pervert, liars and haters.
I bet you can dig up improprieties on of all of them (Democractic & Republican) if you investigated. I'm not saying no one has not done wrong before, I'm saying "don't throw stones at other people's house if yours is made of glass." 😂😂😂😂😅
How is this a new thing . The gop are sexual predators and groomers 😂😂😂let alone child molesters 😂
This feels like a political hit job, target the opposition with sexual accusations, these types of allegations require nothing more than hearsay, no evidence just claims.
Lost his job and no jail for it ? Wow some people do get off easy
Why do poor whites continue to vote against their best interests???????
A true American Hero
I am glad he had the decency to resign, though I am amazed that after being found guilty of such behaviour his party didn't immediately expel him. That is what decent folks should do right?
This shows the incalculable value of local news. A precious resource that is disappearing in the US. NewsChannel5 is the true heart of our democracy.
What a sleazy p.o.s. who would have thought that he would be a republican? The party of sexually oppressed homosexuals and criminal grifters.
Why am I not surprised
Thank you for keeping on this!!
Thank you for getting to the facts.
He’s acting (and legislating) like he’s  still in the 1950s.
"They broke house decorum..."   "And you broke the house policies regarding sexual harassment."  LMFAO
Nice guy
When will older men learn that young women do not see them as peers? A 20 women considers a 30 year old man old. A 19 yr old can not buy beer, not this yr or next. Just because a person can hear you doesn't imply consent. Jesus. And you think an appropriate defense is that you thought it was okay to sexually harass women went you are not at work. If a man came up to your mom at Piggy Wiggly and said these things wouldn't you call the police?
Checkmate
Set up
Welcome to today's GOP!!
trash.
"Secret ethics subcommittee"...come on its just "locker room talk" 🙄
When politicians get caught I think it should be a matter of law that they are IMMEDIATELY dismissed from office and never allowed in politics again.  Is there any way to draft a law for this?  We the people would have to do it because the politicians would not.  Ideas anyone?
Smdh all darkness always comes to light!!!!! 😂
He’s talking like the guiltiest man in America
Hahahaha, these perverted Republicans always barking about democrats being awful things, but they are hiding people who are perverted freaks
Several things here.   First of all, he is not a very attractive man.   Just the opposite, some might say.   So for him, trying to bag a college intern, who may be at her most attractive state is asking for trouble.   Unless, he is Brad Pitt or Leonardo DeCaprio.   The only thing he had going for him was his position and that's gone now.   I'm not sure what he did before he was elected but if he doesn't have a fall back plan, like attorney, then he's completely screwed, as no one, not even the local McDonald's will hire him for their 24 hour drive thru.    Yes, he screwed up royally.   I kind of feel sorry for him, if it were not the fact, that he did not feel sorry for the 3 legislators.   He was the one that pushed the button to execute them from the State house.   Oh how Karma works.   I do believe in Karma and this is just another example.  I'm hoping his lesson changes him.   That is my hope.   We will see.
Oooh the GOP. Most of them bigots, racist, criminals.
Gotta love how explicit the description is of the conversations between the Rep and those women. Dude was really invested in his fantasy, certain it was real... then he tries to spin it as a consensual interaction. You have to know this isn't the first time this man has used his privilege to indulge his cravings. Glad he was outed and ousted. Thanks for having the guts to air the story, News Channel %.
There is no Tennessee 3 only Tennessee 2 we don't give credit to the white woman who wasn't fired she had nothing to loose but everything to gain for personal status there are only 2 people declared as the Tennessee 2
Nasty bastard
He thinks conversations are consensual merely because he opens his mouth? He is so gross!
Gop groomer.
What an F-ing hypocrite.... "They broke house decorum rules...." YOU SEXUALLY HARASSED A 19 YEAR OLD INTERN, THAT VIOLATED ETHICS RULES!!!! ...Family Values Huh
Apparently grabbing them by the P isn't as acceptable as Trump wants the GOP to believe.
Unbelievable. And this mess don’t happen. GOP members don’t leave, they usually have to be put out…if they’re put out.
that's funny if he was a democrat he would be invited to the white house and would be exchanging stories with biden, she was 12 i was 30 stories like that
Not a bit surprised about this republican 😂
all republicans are just so corrupt - expell them all!
Have you ever noticed how everything that legislators do that is perverted is always confidential I guess it’s speech and debate to sexually harass people 😮
Why and not surprise the people that always throw  stones , always are  the  ones  living in a glass house themselves.
Now get sexton on camera 🇺🇲💙🇺🇲
With that face the only thing surprising here is that any victim of this guy is of age cause i mean come ooooooonnnnn...
Shameful, keep investigating and hold all accountable.
Dirty ass old men.  They get away with harming people while two of the three were taken out only because they were born black.  Dirty ass old men.
Republican? Sexual harassment? No!
What a douchbag
A member of the GOP is guilty of sexual assault?!! Shocking!!!!
This is part of the norm for Republicans.
Just making sure I'm clear: Standing up passionately for children's lives gets you expelled, because "guns over children". But sexually harassing young women who are subordinate where you work, you can voluntarily resign, but you won't be expelled.  I saw a great clip the other day of Justin Pearson addressing the legislature now that he's back in. A wyte legislator had mentioned the values of the founders. And Pearson reminded him of some of those values--such as slavery. I think guns over lives and male power over women would be a few more founder values we could toss in that TN likes to support.
They all like little boys😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤I love it, a creep!! little kids? what a republican 😂
These pervs are always the ones claiming their political opponents are "groomers."
Republikkkans are the dregs of humanity.
I really miss investigative reporting exposing criminals. Hope to see more.  Hats off to this News station/reporter. 🇺🇲
God damned gop. What a bunch of hypocritical swine. Lock that sob up!
One question? How would he even know about her tattoos and piercings, if she didn't share that info???  It does seem like there was more to their conversations that led up to the complaint.
Thank God there are some upstanding people left in Tennessee
🤣🤣🤣I love it!!his kind been getting away with 💩like this for years!!self righteousness has its consequences!!🤷
Republicans are sicko freaks. If they aren't molesting children they're harassing women.
People who live in glass houses should not throw stones. GO WAY, IDIAT!!!! 🥷🏽🥷🏽
Laughing out loud at those who still vote for GOP
He is a predator!!!!!!!!!!!!  A freaky, disgusting pedophile!!!!!!!
GOP leader who is a pervert and a racist? And he got caught?.....sweet.
Republicans are the best hypocrites and the worst people.
MR POTATO HEAD!
Like a Boomerang!
Thank you for upholding the highest standard of journalism. Sunshine truly exposes those who wish to hide.
Had him by the balls on that corner!! Out there sweating like a pig lol
Thank you for posting this story. Another misogynistic Republican POS exposed and held accountable. Just because one says something inappropriate and creepy doesn't mean it's a consensual adult conversation and it doesn't matter if it happens outside of the work place
I'm glad to see the majority of the comments in here concentrate on the real issue instead of turning it political. Those who did need to remember all these politicians were crooked and hung out with each other at the same clubs and went to the same schools.
Ha ha dem wht boys as usual
Dear Marj... what to say about your Republican GROOMER, sick pervert buddy. No even a question!
Party of family values
Good riddance, republican.
So it’s confidential to the tax payers what this republicans sexual harassment case is going to cost the tax payers? Good logic republicans. I hope every racist republican is paying attention here.
When are they going to arrest that one of the three that was rioting with blm?
I think we just found the GOP's next presidential candidate.
Another GOP LIAR.
How many other dirty republicans are in office right now? Keep digging, you'll find more
Why is this not surprising.
Conservatives aren't so conservative they use that BS to hide the freak in them basically they're more like what they claim to hate on a daily I think sexual harrassment is worst of the worst
These assholes are consistently terrible people
Twist and shout!  Dirty pathetic slime bag and is the disgusting representative of who?  That is one single man (for a reason).
I bet its 40% of those men that are creepy harassers
Regardless of his politics, he should be in prison. They are going to have fun with him after they see his papers. He earned it
I'm so sick of these hypocritical tw@+s aka Republicans!!!
He took zero accountability. Gross.
Isn't this typical of the Republicans? They rail against certain items or people only to be found out to be doing the exact same thing.
So depraved
I have yet to understand how these men or women think it’s acceptable to talk to anyone like that.
If you could bottle up hypocrisy, this would be some high-proof stuff.  Everywhere I look is more evidence that the GOP has lost their way.  We need some respectable replacements.
And they say drag artist and trans kids are a danger...
The thing that gets me is that he thought that this behavior would be acceptable outside of work. You can bet that he has done this before it's only a matter of time before others come forward
Karma!  LOL!!!!  GOP are the hypocrites again.

He makes me want to vomit.
Repuglilkkklans know no end to their hypocrisy. "RULES FOR THEE, BUT NONE FOR ME."
Pig!
I believe in 2016 Trump said something like they're gonna drain the swamp .. and damn if he wasn't right lol just look at him now, and that gop swamp is draining faster every year 😂 keep it up!
Great journalism, well done! ^-^
Absolutely gross.
This is all too common, particularly with GOP politicians.  Glad they were not able to sweep this one under the rug.   Great reporting!
There seems to be a disproportion of GOP whose party platform is of Christian and Family values, are the ones committing immoral, unethical, and criminal acts compared to the liberals.
Republican Representative Campbell, Vice Chair of the Republican Party in TN, is a sexual deprave that abused his teenage interns. Republicans at it again....
go get em!!!!!!!!!
Wow isn't that something disgusting
A typical Republican - accusing others of misbehavior but performing it by himself and then not capable of owning it as an adult. What a disgust this party is... How somebody can even vote for this guy and similar...
This is what you deserve!
So-- protesting against gun violence- grounds for expulsion. Sexual harassment of supervisees- apparently perfectly OK to the TN GOP leadership. Good to know.
Great job!! Now investigate Sexton and his married mistress, Megan Lane… married to Justin Lane, Gov Bill Lee’s former communications director!  Drain that bigoted hypocrisy swamp!
Another predator republucan sociopath how typical!
Remove him and prisecute him
This is the problem with republicans they are weak
We have to reserve judgment until the investigation is complete lol
every accusation is an admission when it comes to republicans. get these psychos out of office if you want to save the US from becoming a christo-fascist state
Republicans are bigots
obviously sexual harassment is not a violation of rules of decorum.
Another member of the GOP, the party of White Jesus, spreading the good word.
The scary part is that, if not for this piece of journalism, he'd still be seated in the chamber.  They don't care about the character of the person...they only care about getting caught and sacrificing a vote.
As I'm sure someone said once or twice -if you point your fingers at other people, you still have 4 fingers pointing back at you
is anybody surprised?
Every Republican accusation is actually a confession.  It's not new. It's just not exposed enough.
Consensual?  You got convicted of sexual harassment.  That's not consensual.  What a lying piece of garbage.
This guy is a sexual predator.
THE LT GOVENOR AND THIS GUY GOT CAUGHT IN A LIE ! EAST TENNESSEE !
Just because is a ugly mf If was a handsome one she would be sucking dicks all the to Congress  Hypocrites
Speak out against gun violence...we'll toss you out of congress.  Get convicted of sexual harrassment and we'll do nothing to you.  Tennessee republicans are garbage.  The people of Tennessee better wake up.
I don't think you know what consensual means, man.
THE LT GOVENOR AND GUY GOT CAUGHT IN A LIE ! EAST TENNESSEE !
Just your every day run of the mill Christian.
Lol. Good riddance
What about the rest of them sorry bigot's, 🤔 the rest of them need to be investigated and fired too
What a scumbag. He harassed somebody and wants to say it was consensual. What fantastical delusion.
Sick lock up the deplorable maggots.
Th GOP is the projection party.  If they are pointing fingers, you can be pretty sure they are up to something shady
This is why republicans are so aggressively targeting trans people. See how many who have been found to have gay experiences when they target gay people? They are all sexually repressed predators who think a sexually liberated society will ruin the excitement of them being a predator. They are all mentally disturbed people.
Good job to the news channel for this investigation. Campbell will probably retain his position as long as nobody knows about this and his Republican party members will be complicit in letting him slide. It's the "good o'boys club" all over again. But at the end, at least Campbell has the decency to resign on his own. But I won't be surprised if he runs for office again and somehow gets voted in.
Well,  Well,  look who really needed to be expelled? These people has no morals.
Thank you Channel 5.....there's tons more to expose all thru TN, keep @ it!
Ah, the secret process, gotta love it.
Y'all did a great job investigating and reporting... Keep it up.
The Republican's claims of family values is a schtick, when they have conventions, hotel PPV porn sales increase and sex workers see an increase of revenue.   Their voters look the other way.
Yeah, this guy did not know this reporter had the goods.
Oppsy
All conservatives have smooth brains
Resigned??? Charge these criminals, you news and your bootlickers never demand JUSTICE. Very telling indeed
"Conservative Family Values".
What a LIAR!!!!!... EVERY word is the TRUTH!!.. How do I know? ... glad you asked! Because sometimes it takes one to KNOW ONE!!  She should SUE HIS NASTY ASS😡😡😡
Old gross men preying on young women, starting their adulthood. They are easy prey and vulnerable!    Try this crap on women your own age and see them quickly put you in your place!
Creep.
"secret ethics panel": Just love the sound of that. Uh huh.
He's a supremacist without  supremacy,just a inbred racist.These are the people that believe in marriage and babies with 12yr old children.
So republicans do like gay ppl. Or is it just gay hot woman 😂
Karma Campbell dam dummy
Was that a swig of vodka?  A consensual conversation?  Wow!!!! Guess my dog qualifies to run for office.
Wait...I thought it was the Dems who are the perverts...at least that's what the GOP keeps saying....projection maybe? lol
I know from experience work place policies do apply outside of work if you are interacting with coworkers.
Can't make this shit up lol the GOP is a fkin joke
Oh, my, this guy is a creep!😮
Hypocritical Republicans.  Thank you Karma!
Don't say more cause they never help the victims have their day. They just hide them away
Well, his facial hair is a big fat red flag.
This behavior and the vote to expel public servants from their workplace are two separate issues.  As far as I'm concerned Speaker Sexton should also resign for misrepresenting spoken votes and for allowing the expulsion to proceed.
Tennessee GOP are racist hypocrites. That perv got what he deserved. I hope their are more.
Can you imagine the depths of my surprise/ s
Little Scotty will now have to go back to his old job pumping septic tanks.
When you make yourself a national figure by being a pos you make people want to look into you.
Cam'ron Sex-ton needs to be next. The Andy Farmer can get what's coming to him...lmfao
KARMA😂
Those who live in glass houses throw the sharpest stones.
Who is paying for her move GOP donation or ALL TN TAXPAYERS????
what a snake! He knows darn well that if he has a working relationship with someone there's a power dynamic. He used his power over them to try and get what he wanted. I hope the rest of them are voted out now that people know they hid this and voted to expel the Tenn3
These disgusting (white) GOP lawmakers are the most perverted people I’ve ever seen or heard!🤢🤮 These people use moral, family, Christian values as a political tool to TRICK their naïve constituents !😂 When everybody in their families’ and in their districts KNOW that these child molesting, infidelity having (Sexton), down low gay loving, undercover “Johns”, gop lawmakers are not in any position to lead theyr families much less a state!👏🏾👍🏾👏🏾👍🏾😂
Way to go Phil! Keep it up! It will be a sad day for all of us Tennesseeans when you decide to retire. Now get after cammy sexton before he makes a run for the governors office. Again, great job exposing these idiots.
Lol! Yes! Let the hypocrisy of the GOP be known!
Angry he got caught...
East TN reps getting a lil cra cra lol. "Now tell me what you do behind closed doors.  Gotta pee pee, let me see your genitals first." LMFAO LOL 😆 🤣 😂  ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ 🔥 🔥 🔥
GOOD JOB.
Now the rest
He's lying, of course.  They are always found to be guilty.  😊
The fact that the speaker of the House did not remove him immediately shows that he is unfit to hold that office and he should resign
Our government is so corrupt. From local level all the way to the biden crime family. No wonder why our country is the shit show that it is. There are more criminals leading our country, than there are in drug cartels. This is disgraceful.
Why didn't the repukelikkkans yell to the rafters about throwing this criminal out of their 'house'?????   Wouldn't they be proud of getting rid of this sex abuser????  Why did they make a 'secret' vote at night???    Why do the repukelikkkans vote on and pass this type decision during the middle of the night????  Are they embarrassed by their own corrupt deeds???😂😂😂❤😂😂😂  Retardlikkkans!!!  You gotta just love their slimey corruption.  They do!!
Republicans are pure evil
What an a$$hole. And he's STILL DEFENDING HIMSELF!  Keep talking on camera...PLEASE
Stay classy, GOP.
Yes, thank you, Phil. Thanks NC5. These little bricks need to be unlodged, so we can pull out the larger ones.
The party of great family values, NOT
Once again a “Traditional” Republican being obsessed with the LGBT content. I genuinely wonder if they know that the L in LBGT stands for Lesbian, Republicans are alls insane Fk.
This is the epitome of "sorry he got caught."
Cuz about to hyperventilate.  Gimme 5 seconds.
When you become God: do as I say, not as I do *cough Go join Mr candypants now. And Mr Byrd. Scott was crying, a lump in his throat?
Great reporting! What a turd. Thank you for doing this excellent story.
😂🎉 it's my birthday 🎂 and this is a good gift.
Republican politician
So they allowed him to resign quietly. He didn't lose anything. The young interns were harassed and nothing happened. They are such hypocrites.
Once again the “party of family values” strikes again.
Republican hypocrisy is only out done by their disdain for God.
When found guilty they need pay for investigation. If they do not want to pay they can resign after finding out about investigation.
This is what we r talkin about!!!! A sexual predator protected but 2 black men ousted 4 speaking out on gun laws. He was visibly shook.
I love it!!!!
Dude really said "I thought they were my friends 😢"
Thank you for reporting. Good riddance to this awful man and any others who operate on double standards and hypocracy.
He is for sure guilty of not being able to pull off that over the shoulder bag.
Do Republican men have no idea how to talk to women? Can they truly be this ignorant?  Just creepy weirdos.
This little dude is so creepy I feel sorry for the girl
Republicans have consistently cornered the market on lowlifes, perverts, incels, and pedos.  Why is that?
Who’s surprised by this. They’re always throwing stones and hiding their hands. I’m so glad he got what he so rightly deserved. Now less get the other Hippocrates that hid this ish…
Darn the reporter just said it out…
This liar tells you EVERYTHING you want to know about the Republican Party!!! Totally outrageously outta control!!! 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤪🤪🤪
All ways the self righteous with all the dirtiest of hands
He's a scumbag that got exposed for being a dirty old man. But he wanted to be this high and mighty lawmaker that was expelling lawmakers. He never thought he did anything wrong, because he figured he was above the law. He thought wrong.
Well now don’t beat all.  GOP are scum of earth.
Grand Old Perverts
'secret ethics panel' does not sound ethical at all!
And these are members of the same party calling Democrats groomers and pedophiles. 🤔
Gee that's a shock. Tennessee needs to clean the shit outta their system, every bit as bad as Oklahoma here does.
Always the GOP.  Always
Excellent work. New subscriber here.
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Seems to me that since the committee didn't enforce there rules and expel the guilty, they should be investigated also.  So background checks for all politicians to include voting records.
Clown! Standing there in your SANCTIMONIOUS stance all the whole you're a PERV! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡😅 Keep messing with God's children!
More power to Journalism.  We the People.  United We Stand.  Vote them Out !
Thank goodness for investigative news and press!  He wanted to watch lesbian sex, but what was his record on LGBT issues?
They all have skeletons 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 KARMA
Fine journalism
Hypocrisy is the only platform Republicans are consistent at.
GOP or DNC...If you think corruption and sleaze doesn't exist on BOTH sides of the aisle? Then you need to WTFU!! Stop being that parent that says "Not MY kid!" ...
Conservatives are historically base evil.
Fuck around and find out.
Undercover republican party, keep outing them...👺
Proper investigative journalism, good job.
Womp womp
These is who republicans are
Scotty is obviously a disgustingly narcissistic creeper… What young woman would Ever find this unattractive loser sexually attractive? The Only way men like him, usually religious and Republican have a foot in the door of women, albeit just 19… The Entitlement of the good  ole’ boys is revolting.. Who raises these secretive pervs anyway?? 🤢
Nothing new here
Disgusting pig.
republican liar hypocrite fascists !
POS like that should be hidding under a rock. Not expelling others.
Great reporting!!! This is what speaking truth to power looks like!
Republicans, heal thyselves
Sounds a lot like he thinks any conversation that does not include him getting pepper sprayed right in his sexist, bigoted face counts as 'consensual'.  Don't worry, his friends and fellow sexist bigots won't learn anything at all from this.  Good work, keep up the investigations.
Great reporting Phil Williams! Got 'em!! 🏅
GOP = House of Cards
Karma
This is Bogus especially since UN WANTS TO DECRIMINALIZE ADULTS RELATIONS WITH MINORS!!!
More GOP Secrets…. Who is shocked or who is not👀 raise your hand for not shocked…🙋🏾‍♀️
Pure Media Scum this man Crime has nothing to do with the Three Treasonous Traitors of the Citizens of the United States 🇺🇸 and need to be held Accountable for their Crimes against the Majority of United States 🇺🇸 Citizens. Pure Media Scum.
I am not advocating for the guy but when your under investigation you should never talk to the police or reporters without a lawyer.  The reporter is not his friend so why answer questions that could harm your case or make you look worse than it already is.  A lot of dumb people admit there crimes to police when just asked... like a simple thing "where you wearing seatbelt?"  ~ no I was NOT ~ well thanks for admitting your an idiot and here is a ticket for not wearing a seatbelt!
Those who live in glass houses.
Typical Republican P.O.S.  They're all hypocrites and everything they blame on their opponents is what they're actually up to. Breaking laws, committing fraud, and being generally really horrible people.
Everyone is shocked. We’re all shocked. :/
Hypocrisy is spelled GOP.
Let’s hear from the women
Good for them reporting this creep, if only more women would stop bending over for their careers and do the right thing. I’m sure theirs allot more.
This is what happens when you vote along party lines rather than for the individual's credentials. You put a bunch of pedophiles, criminals, mobsters and neo nazis in office.  What ever they accuse others of is what they themselves are doing. It's called projection. You want to know what today's republicans are up to, just listen to what they accuse others of. It's a distraction.
Another Republican sexual predator caught in the act. And they had the temerity to accuse the Democrats. Hypocrisy at the extreme.
What is wrong with staying away from people at work.  I don't get it.
This guy is a stalker and a predator. Count on republicans to invade your privacy and try to dominate you sexually. The party of well armed "alpha males".
A woman was returned a wrench to him. Major deflection
As a Republican, I fully support this decision to oust him! I personally believe he is lying. However, EVERYONE is entitled by LAW to a fair trial. Someone can throw shade on another "just because" they don't like them...as many of us have found in our own workforce! But I think the guy is sleazy and lying.
Ahhh those moral family value law abiding Southern Repukelicans!
Consensual Conversations?
play stupid games win stupid prizes..
Republicans are the party of LIES and CRIMINALITY
Haha. 😂 what an old perv.
That's so perfect. Another scumbag Republican gets it like he threw a boomerang. It came right back to him.
Have come to make obeisance to the algorithm gods. May this content be viewed from the rivers to the ends of the earth.
What does this have to do with other unruly expelled members? Fake new playing politics. This is why our country is in shambles ..bud light baby killing sodomite loving freak news organization trash
More corruption in the GOP. Anyone voting for Republicans are voting their freedoms and rights away.
He voted to expel them while he should have been expelled. His vote should not have counted.
All Republicans are the same sick
So you see kiddies because this white republican was immoral that makes the black democrat that he voted against righteous. Now you understand how the media works. 😃👍
Local News organizations do a much better job and have more integrity than the "24x7 National Entertainment Networks" do.
He has all the looks of a pedo! Looks like another Nadler in the making.
TN is lucky to have journalists like these ... too bad TN can't catch a break in the dirt bag department.
these racist pigZ didn't see this one coming!!
😂😂😂😂
I really hope she sues them big time.
Yes he is a republican there are so many that say they have family values but  they don’t
The party that claims to want to protect children are just full of sexual deviants due to all the repression. Every accusation is a confession from these sick GOP pervs.  Excellent reporting, thank you for bringing this disgusting and inappropriate behaviour to light! This man should be nowhere NEAR a government position.
sounds like a set up and he walked right into it eyes wide open LOL
You cant even make this up lolololololol.
I, for one, am _shocked_ /s
Hypocrites! And I doubt he's the only one. He wasn't found guilty just because of an arbitrary complaint
Wow, what hypocrisy. They expell three member for demonstrating their rights of free speech but rug sweep sexual harrassment with one of their members. Way to make your state more famous and to show yes, this was about race.
Why does this not surprise me at all?
Being a pervert in the Republican Party is not a defect it’s a feature that makes them attractive to the perv voters, good for them!
This is why men and women shouldn’t work together. Men are always trying to bust nuts. 😂. Policy’s aren’t law.
Could he lie any harder?
Watch that fool pretend like he's in a Snickers commercial, asking for a minute from a reporter investigating workplace sexual harassment.
But don't you know says the house member here white has always made right how dare you ask me these questions don't you see the color of my skin and that I am a man and as a republican man of white skin I should be above being persecuted with these questions come on say what you feel as a white Republican man you feel you are above the law
Sexual harassment ignored until he became a problem and then they decided to use it against him. Right action, wrong reason. Dallas, Texas
Sloppy Campbell has been a naughty boy 😮😂
Hahahahaha
They are always pointing fingers and shouting accusations...the guilty ones. The Rethuglikkkan party has become a haven for liars, sex offenders and all manner of corruption.     So can we conclude that the experiment that put an unregistered sex offender with a porn star wife in the Whitehouse was an abject failure. Bigly 😞
The Republican party just seems to be pedophiles and rapists and in both cases they simply just can't take no for an answer one because they don't respect the children are raping and others because they don't respect the women they're raping everybody knows rape is singing about control and power not about love
I wonder how many ani-abortions this guy has rung up.
Why is it that the GOP has so many sexual predators?   You have trump.  Trump supporting Cohen and ghislaine maxwell.
conservatives think they are so high minded with their jesus bullshit, and then we find them stealing, defrauding, soliciting, and harassing.
Creepy Republican? Imagine
Everything Republicans  accuse democrats of being are what republicans are doing
Great work! Keep investigating the people in the Capitol in TN.
Someone needs to teach this guy how to say, “no comment.”  I’m glad he didn’t, but damn.
So the Republican screaming the loudest about pedophiles and rumors seem to be full of pedophiles and groomers adult man was lifting out of young college children barely out of high school I guess it's just Republicans like them young from Matt gaetz to Judge Roy Moore to this fella to one of the architects of the don't say gay bill they all seem to be fiddling children
Always the republicans doing something wrong.
Ridiculous that he claims that none of those conversations happened yet at the end, he says that he thought he was having a consensual conversation with friends, so which one is the case?
Excellent job NewsChannel5.  Now expose the hypocrites that tried to sweep this under the rug.
Who else is doing some shifty shenanigans. Cesspool. Funny how all these people being found out are republicans. I don’t doubt that there are some democrats too but arrogance and assumption that you can do what you want because of your position will hopefully begin to diminish as these types are continually called out.
How old is fat boy fat???
Still think the Tenn 3 vocal group should have been suspended. This kind of behavior by the rep should have been dealt with by the leadership and it was. A professional investigator should look into this fully and appropriate action taken.
Disgusting men!! Can not leave women in peace. Always abusive.😮
The GOP is downright evil now.  Nothing more.....nothing less.  Evil.
Shocker
🤢🤢🤢
And of course this is the kind of guy that call LGBT people "groomers". It's ALWAYS projection with those people.
Lol, every conservative ever. Then gets a girl pregnant and makes her get an abortion lmao. It's not even news at this point. Biggest hypocrites on Earth. Oh man, the cherry on top is him offering THC gummies which conservatives were all against but progressives had to fight hard for the legalization and normalization of it. Now they are using it to groom innocent women and abuse their power. It really wouldn't even be that hilarious if they didn't pretend to be about family values. As I said, not even news at this point.
NOT surprising
Caught in 4k 😮
Short, fat, and abusive!  He has got it all ladies!
‘Tis a far far better thing to sexually harass girls off the clock than it is to break rules of work decorum.
Wrong is wrong does not matter what side of isle you're on whether it's the Tennessee 3 or the slimeball harrassing interns good riddance to all.
😂😢 WOW!!! Absolutely disgusting!!! Tax payers follow the money not just the politics!!! Get rid of the black representatives on full display! Sweep this white man's mess under the rug and let this story run one time 😮😢 PURE America
What? Someone from the "Rules for thee not for me" "republican" crowd had to take personal responsibility for their actions? Biig ooof.
These types are always put forth as being the moral majority (Jerry Falwell), but if you just peal the orange back only a little, you'll find that there is nothing moral about these people, never has there ever been.
WELL DONE NEWS CHANNEL 5👍 TOP JOURNALISM 👍 THANK YOU FOR EXPOSING THIS VILE DISGUSTING MAN'S BEHAVIOR AGAINST YOUNG WOMEN INTERNEES AND THE ABUSE OF POWER AND THE HYPOCRISY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY - INVOLVING THIS VICE CHAIR OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP OF THE TENNESSEE STATE HOUSE - A SEX PEST - WHO WAS FOUND GUILTY BY THE ETHICS COMMITTEE OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT BUT WAS NOT REMOVED FROM OFFICE OR EVEN FROM ANY OF HIS COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS - NO PUNISHMENT WHATSOEVER !! THATS THE GOOD OLE WHITE BOYS CLUB OF TENNESSEE AT WORK !  HE 💩 WAS ALLOWED TO VOTE THAT THE TENNESSEE THREE BE PERMANENTLY EXPELLED FROM OFFICE FOR STANDING UP TO SUPPORT YOUNG STUDENTS WANTING TO BE SAFE IN THEIR SCHOOLS & COLLEGES !!  PROTECTING THE YOUNG IS A FOREIGN CONCEPT TO THIS LOWLIFE SEXUAL PREDATOR OF THE YOUNG !! 😈💩 KUDOS TO YOU FOR YOUR ON THE STREET CONFRONTATION & GOTCHA MOMENT - WELL DONE👍 🏆
I believe him
Now this is how investigative journalism is done.  If only major news networks did this.  Local news and newspaper outlets need more funding.
This is what's confusing about republicans opposing abortion. They must have love children and hush money flowing like traitor Trump
Ugh, so creepy. Blech!
If that's all it took, then no disrespect, but you guys gotta dig harder.  How many of those privileged assholes do you think have been pulling this, knowing that there are no consequences ... until now.  Y'all get 'em!
Grand Old Perverts...
It still doesn't negate the legitimate vote to expel the two disruptive members.
WOMP WOMP
If you look up the word “creeper” in the dictionary, you will see a picture of this guy. He is the very definition of the word.
Republicans are garbage. Do Tennesseans think this is good governance? Is this what you call “Christian family values”? Disgusting and hypocritical.
Put this reporter on the white house press corp
HOW ABOUT SEXTON?
Keep digging. There's more.
The GOP cover up their dirty secrets only to have them revealed eventually.  Everyone of them will be brought out into the light,  in today's world with the internet, all will come out.  Eventually,
This is what happens when you don't keep your hands to yourself.This is also what happens when you say the wrong thing to people concerning sex.
Seems like it’s always republicans that do the crazy sex stuff they accuse dems of……..sick fuxks
Harassing boys or girls?  Or both?
Isn’t it funny how it’s always Republicans? Weird how for every 20 of these 19 of them are Republicans and only one turns out to be a Democrat or an independent. It’s almost as though one party over the other has a monopoly on sexual violence and impropriety. And yet they’re the party who’s constantly yelling about it. Interesting.
This guy got to resign, while the other people got expelled over a protest?!
Republicans projecting their own crimes on to others. The chickens are home to roost.
This is all to habitual in the GOP. Even when confronted with evidence, Deny, Deny, Deny 🤷‍♀️ Not surprising at all. I wish the state of Tennessee luck and hopefully change (not the kind you pull out of your dirty pocket)
Great reporting! Phil, you got a new subscriber
What a shining example of integrity 😂
Sleezeball
Rules for Thee but not for Me.  PAB Republican.
Just a dirty dog liar. Typical Republican Politician. No character. No conscience.
Hahahaahhahahahahaha  It's always the same, preaching virtue, doing the nasty on the backyard....
Haha vote accordingly.
Why am I not surprised.  💙
Bet he's very Christian 😮
Time for Merrick Garland to step up his game on his promise to investigate into the Nazi lovers in Police depts. and now incl. State legislatures please...or is that the Ethics Committees job to make sure those who are found guilty of being unethical, to put it nicely, go through the proper procedures, and follow through?  I hope other constituents in the legislature get investigated bc they didn't bump this creep out?
This is why cops hate camera operators😂😂 they have something to hide. 😂 Women and cops lie all the time, why is that?
That awkward coffee drinking had him like a deer in the headlights.
So much winning. They need to lock the nasty bastard down!
😂 Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.  So I will show you am a racist. What you can't see is how I act to the women around me. They should file an ethics complaint against you .
How can a legislator be so stupid and ignorant of policy?  Good riddance - let's hope his replacement has better smarts.  Sad that he got elected.
A few years ago I would say, we must have more women in politics, but seen Margie Taylor, green, and what she’s done with her marriage, and the way, Mrs. Bobert acts, And I would say I would think about it nowadays. This guy totally looks like a pervert, someone that should not be in a place of power. At all.
Imagine not turfing his sorry ass to the kerb the moment you found out about this, in fact keeping it quiet until found out, but then expelling two black men who had the temerity to not know their place. This says everything you need to know about all of them. The speaker's attempt to try and keep this quiet shows that he has no place in that position.
Too bad his cup didn't have cyanide. At least he had the honor to step down, if only the rest of his party could take notes
Aww the Klan Member didnt like he couldnt keep none whites out. DIRTY GOP WHITE MEN
Every Republican accusation is a damning admission of guilt.  💯
BWAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
Hypocrite!
Republicans can’t not lie
But he’s a Christian 😳🙄
So the Republican message: sexual harassment is fine but not wanting kids to be murdered is something you get expelled over. What a joke. When they die, they will have to answer to the lord.
Not what about the guy who doesn't even live in the district he represents.
What a disgrace! SMH!
He's not the only one, a lot of republicans are predators, gay groomers, and pedophiles.....projection is their main stratagy.
WWWWHHHHHHAAAATTTTT - A man from the party of "family values" got busted for sexual misconduct?  But that NEVER happens  [/sarcasm]
GOP Gang of Perverts
Those wacky republicans.......They just do what they want. What does mtg have to say about it?............
See MTG it isn't Dems but GOP.
Yep, honorable for sure, gop thinks this is ok?
Imagine how many more scumbags like this guy exist in state legislatures. One of these poor interns being manipulated by a person in a position they one day aspire to be in could be your kid. Not all of them have the will power to say no.
The people who voted him in knew exactly who they voted in.
Yellow belly coward.  I would greatly like to tell his father that he is a worthless parent.
"if I was to speak to an Intern in the future" ??? He was planning on holding his job even after found Guilty? Whoa Nelly these deplorables!
good riddance
"give me just 5 seconds I am thinking how to lie my way out of this one, maybe mention God and the bible, blame an activist judge, the intern was too sexy, antifa set me up. etc"
So does anyone know who the GOP member was who pissed on another's seat? PLUS his cup says everything you know about him
This is where the GOP is, they preach family values, grooming, Americans we must see the hypocrisy of these people, that do not have an ounce of family values within themselves, we must vote these people out of office.
The top GOP speaker should resigned. He knew this creep did wrong!
This guy is such a tool. You cannot have a consensual sexually explicit conversation (even outside of work) when you are in a position of power over the other individuals.  The fact that he didn't understand or didn't want to understand this means he should not work around other humans.
His game perve. Bill Clinton is a real player and got game lol
You know a non guilty person would have fought to stay in their positions not resigning, guilty as charged. Clown
A Republican being a hypocrite and accused of sexual harassment? Who would of thought? I mean this stuff never happens? 🙄
GOP hypocrisy, as usual. Do they even see it? Sure they do but their ignorant followers don't. Ugh
This story iz bullshit she when to his house and then sfood this long to be azked for sevefal hugs?
They have been breaking the rules & laws with their abhorrent behavior for so long that they are shocked when they are disciplined. No more of his arrogance. 👋🏾👋🏾👏🏾
Great reporting. We need to know the truth.
Dude hit a younger girl. It’s not the end of the world, but in today’s day and age it makes him public enemy number one.
Like all of them justifying their disgusting behaviour.
Go get the bad guys, mostly Republican I’m sorry to say. RAMMs take action (Republicans Against Maga Maniacs).
Time after time. Republicans at their lowest. Stop supporting their bad ways.
Good riddance.  VOTE BLUE next time around TN!!!
👍
::Shocked Pikachu face::
Is that a swastika on his where bottle?
They call themselves the moral majority judging everyone else and it always turns out they they are the morally bankrupt ones.
Well well well, ain’t this some shit!  As much as I want to take pleasure in this wonderful display of karma being a cold hard bitch and justice under God being displayed, we must remember that this pudgy NRA fuccboi votes to expel State Reps protesting on the behalf of families ripped apart by senseless gun violence, even for the one at that private school in Nashville.  This piece of conservative garbage still has a future somewhere, but those poor children and adults at that Nashville school do not. I pray God Allah change his heart and ways to where he may one day serve at the pleasure of the people, not of himself.
Republicans are simply the worse and they know it. That's why they distract us with trans people, LGBTQ and books to hide that fact and give their constituents something else to be mad about.
Scumbag pervert. Republicans are obsessed with anything about sex!
"Racist who looks like human potato found guilty of sexual harassment of interns"
Wow what kinds of folks are in our midst GOP? Why so many hypocrites ?
Btw, the response to this will be a law making public disclosure more difficult. Florida just did it with governor flight records.
Tennessee is a mess, it must be because they are so far left😂
Republican; Dictionary Definitions from Oxford Languages · Learn more re·pub·li·can adjective (of a form of entitlement, cult like control, etc.) belonging to, or characteristic of a cult. noun 1. a person advocating or supporting cult like influence or control over others. "those who favored the continuance of the cult control made every effort to defeat the authorities and to have cult members take their places" 2. a member or supporter of the cult.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE ??? “We had a consensual conversation among adults”, is he F**KING CRAZY or JUST PLAIN STUPID ! ! ! ? THERE IS NO SUCH THING ! On what planet do these STUPID Republicans “think” that it is a reasonable “explanation” to suggest that men and women routinely have “conversations” with AGREED guardrails, or lack of any guardrails ???  This man is unfathomably stupid for thinking that this would sound like a plausible explanation to ANYONE !
Phil: "could I talk to you for a minute?" Every politician: "ah crap, he knows."
If you are in a position of power it’s best to maintain a professional relationship at all times. Consensual conversation? Ugh
That fatass degenerate looked like he was on the verge of a heart attack when Phil first confronted him with this.  "Give me 5 seconds, I feel like Ima 'bout to start hyperventilating."
This is what happens when you're a hypocrite
Family Values.
I didn't know a workplace policy could be enforced while not at work. -- Maybe these folks should have to attend the same ethics, harassment, etc. courses that I have to attend every year (mandatory) for where I work. This is clearly explained and stated numerous times.
Typical disgusting Republikkklan behavior.
How disgusting! Republicans the party of evil. They want to marry children, force them to carry rapist babies. Taking away history, access to healthcare and even want to take away social security. They want to punish Disney for inclusion, ban books(with colored novelist, history and lgbtqia) and destroy beer products at groceries. they support white supremacy, and making gay marriage illegal, living with an unwed partner illegal, interracial relationships illegal. But they support Karen behavior, support terrorist, help hide child abusers,defund police, fbi and boarder patrol. But promote GUNS!!!! Reality and that’s just the beginning of this year!💕🇺🇸🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🌈
Once again the party of morals and decency are always getting caught doing Immoral and Indecent things
What can you expect from the party that had no issue with their presidental candidate openly bragging about grabbing women by the p*ssy? Or had any issue that he cheated on every single one of his wives? Or had issue with him sexualizing his daughter to the point of actually saying “perhaps we’d be dating if she wasn’t my daughter.”    Everything the Party of Family Values, Law and Order and the Christian Right accuse others of doing they are doing in triplicate.
Why don't they give y'all some chairs?
There is no room for this behavior in our society.  This man isn't fit to dig coal if other people need to be there.  Get rekt
That Jones guy called it out before he was expelled. They all knew the allegations but republicans protect their own until the end.
House of cards. Republicans!
the GOP is more like the hypocritical ol party these days
😂 these damned Republicans when our people just going to get them out of all positions of power.
They expel people for protesting and keep people guilty of sexual harassment. Says a lot.
Just another perverted Republican hes a groomer hes doing it for the children. It's another perverted Republican.
Lying POS
Byeee Dickwad !!!
We all know the GOP are some hypocrites!  Terrible devils.
Don't forget reTHUGlican policy is that it's perfectly fine to FORCE your attentions upon any woman you want.  Gotta love that RAPE culture the radicalized right has going.
Thank god we have fine republican politicians to make sure we don’t have anything vulgar in Tennessee like drag shows or trans people
JESUS Said that, THAT WHICH is done in the dark will come to LIGHT 🕯️. The Republican party a party of LAW and ORDER and of FAMILY VALUES and GOD and COUNTRY 😮😅😊
Great reporting. Continue to investigate until everyone responsible for the cover up resigns.
wow look at his physical reaction to this, his tells say he is lying....
Lol.. So he resigned, even though they "lied" about everything? Clown. Another proud representative of the "Party of Personal Responsibility".
Yet he did it....
Ah, Christian values in action. He must be a drag queen, right? Right?
Typical white men behavior, brutalize black people, turn a blind eye on anything another white person does, used his power to expell two black men from a position of power while other white men looked the other way as he did what he did, this is wtf we have been screaming about for years.
Thi is what genetic immunity to law looks like. This man and his criminal acts were protected and buried by his colleagues / fellow criminals
Good. I hope that this interview was the reason that he resigned. Thanks for not letting him off easy. What a creep. You have no business representing anyone if you honestly feel that you can have those types of conversations with anyone that you work with, even off the clock.
Wow! He's short and fat...disgusting behavior...full of B.S. But he's white, so...probably an incel.
Somebody tell him the bottle hanging between his legs isn't a good look.
"Consensual adult conversation" made it so much worse. What a gross POS.
Women have been dealing with swine like this for an eternity. Listen to him. It makes me sick, and, it takes me back to being 12 years old and hearing myself discussed like I was a peice of meat instead of a little girl tap dancing at a local fair. And it was only the beginning- it was the first instance if a lifetime of filthy old men - in every job a woman will have, or at any time anywhere, for the rest of your life , these pigs will rise up on their hind legs and go after you. And esp in such a violent christo-fascist country like America. They own you . Christian Taliban. Bets on him being a " Christian ".😢
He gives me the creeps just by his demeanor!
The party of pedos. And they keep proving it, over and over.
It's not surprising that this man, a republican, who sees women as sexual objects that solely exist for his pleasure, would also have a limited, flawed, and negative view of African American men and poor/elderly people needing government assistance.
Just think that if he had raped the intern(s) and they had gotten pregnant, they would have to carry the baby to birth.  GOP is disgusting and immoral.
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Bruh… just say no comment and keep walking lol
why are they all so awful
The true values of the GOP! when they accuse democrats of being groomers and pedos... maybe they should have a good look in the mirror!
So the GOP actually PAID the expenses for the young women to break their lease AND stay in a hotel to get away from their own man, AND kept this all hush-hush, at the same time they made a big fanfare about the three Democrats who participated in a peaceful protest and thereby broke "decorum" so had to be expelled (the two black members anyway)...  A Democrat House member needs to stand up and ask the GOP body if this is true, and if so, how can they justify their complete hypocrisy in their behavior?  Then we can watch them all stutter and squirm instead of just the one rat who resigned!
Duh! Of course they have their own secrets.  I’m sure many of them have done really bad things and get away with it this guy got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
Boy what a terrific reporter.   Go Phil Go!!!
Wow, that's nasty. I feel like I need to bleach my ears after that....
Bet if you look closer at all the republicans in that state they will all resign and run like rats. Nothing but little dick fat-as white Republican snowflake maggots. I love the exposure! Keep up the great work, expose all of them!
oh, big surprise
Mmmmm, can we say Hypocrisy let's expell  Democrat for wanting to protect children, but keep the republican that sexual harass interns .
This is not going to be the last one. They made people mad when they ignored the needs of the people.
Hypocrisy. These asshats are good entertainment
Time for a purge.
His defense is the script of a coward.
What does his vote to expel have to do with sexual harassment?  Cringy bias at its finest
fuck around and find out! just cus you are in a position of power does not mean you can get away with and or do anything you want. i love seeing all this dirty laundry from the GOP. bunch of fucking hypocrites
typical republicans, man.
See this is where the liberal sheep are.
Classic GOP
6:10 the best part, ....... 'confidential'?, with our tax dallors?
Oh, wow. Scandalous that some GOP is a sexual predator, and it has NOTHING to do with Democrats disrespectful disruption of the legislature. Way to deflect.
Interesting that 3 law makers are thrown out for speaking for the people but the GOP continues to protect their own corrupt people.
The problem with Republicans is grabbing them by the 🐈
And THAT is exactly why we need investigative news channels. If they can back up their reporting I want to hear it. Otherwise they need to keep it to themselves until they have evidence. We’ve had too much rumor and outright lies parading as news over the last few years that has damaged the fabric of our country.
Republicans preaching to us about morals and values. The whole party has multiple assault cases. These people need to go sort out their own house.
And of course the Bible thumping Republican voters of Tennessee will not demand resignations from the Republican leaders in the House who attempted to cover this up.
I mean seriously. Is anyone shocked?
If OrangeTweety can grab women inappropriately and still be POTUS, insight an insurrection, get indicted, get investigated for mishandling United States of America national security docs, praise our global adversaries while berating our own military and government leadership, misrepresent facts about our elections, raise money from regular Americans not rich people because of misrepresenting election results, and now be considered the leading GOP POTUS candidate for re-election, I'm definitely not the least bit surprised or taken aback that this violation of sexual harassment policies in TN occurred and for all intent and purposes,  was seemingly swept under the rug as well.  This is US. POWER IS INTOXICATING.
Perfect lol
Unlike Swalwell who slept with a Chinese spy.
Gross
bye groomer
A Democrat would never resign in that position . They would have thrown every victim card in the book.
I know. Because Republicans are corrupt as hell. Every single 9ne except 2 have shown what they wouldn't do to be in power. That's why the law doesn't apply to them and we have to come together to expel every single Republican and build a new party from the ground up because Republicans can't be trusted to put America and Americans first.
You can just see him crumble inside when he got confronted, he definitely didn't see that conversation coming
Who thinks he's the only one?
What a pi…
WHO COVERED IT UP?
definitely has some kind of problem--into phallic drink cups
It was just locker room banter I guess!!! Republicans are such hypocrites!!!!!
GOP scum!!! All of them! Racist, low iq, power hungry POS's!!!!
Asi te queria agarrar, puerco 😂
Ohhhhh. Thought republicans didn’t do grooming.
The plot thickens.
Scum. Elected by scum.
Oh my in these Bible Belt representatives are doing this? As they speak of only the Bible I thought they walked in God’s steps. Maybe they are human maybe MAGA is the devil causing the sins of man.
MUCH More DIRT Is Going On BEHIND The Scenes OF GOVERNMENT! PEACE&LUV
Pervert pervert pervert pervert pervert pervert pervert
He got dry mouth! 😂😂😂😂
Let's see : 1. Groomers- Republicans                      1,000  +                     2. Drag Queens                      0
Man, maybe this was meant to be coz if he kept his mouth shut and laid low, people wouldn’t have known.
Greedy Old Perverts
“Let me just get 5 seconds” and then he proceeds to be super super greasy and afraid 😂😂
Didn't they keep a member who literally molested CHILDREN?  No expulsion for that?  Unbelievable.  Keep digging reporters!  Get rid of all of them.
Slime, slime, slime all over this Land. 🇺🇸
Oh big surprise, another perv Republican🤯🤡
Well, well another creep...
😂😂😂😂😂 republicans are so so so so pathetic
Why are you Gey
Justice is working ,  it's a good thing.
Get rid of any and all that do or would do
Talking about Karma. What goes around comes around.
What a waste of money
Omg, a republican politician is a misogynist, sexual predator?  Literally no one is suprised.
How come it's always the republicans lawmakers are getting in trouble for sexual assault or preying on minors. It's like their accusations are projections. It's a real head scratcher for sure.  Why would a bunch of old, white, racist sexist, power grabbing nazis target two freshman back reps and a woman, all from the democratic party, all who where legally elected, all who was standing with the people who are sick and tired of being afraid of getting shot just because they accidentally went to the wrong address, another head scratcher for sure.   Nazi republicans win because our lack of willingness to call their shit out.
If fascism takes over the country... men like these will be able to and will force themselves upon your friends, your daughters, your sisters, your wives, and anyone else they choose.
What creepy, chubby, arrogant little A-hole. Who votes for a nerd like thgis anyway?
Shouldn’t have resigned. Crimes are a feature of all republican lawmakers.
I knew there was something creepy about him soon as he pulled his coffee out of a holster. I mean who does that.
I'm really not surprised. After hearing very disturbing things, like marrying 12 year olds, from republicans. I feel, again, that they project on others what they themselves are guilty of. If it's vile, underhanded and/or just plan wrong, that is what I expect from republicans today. And they never disappoint my view. They don't need an office, they need professional mental help.
What a creep
Wonder if the GOP will have a...temper tantrum...over this.
A real lying piece of Garbage.  Jail time.
Real swell guy,, thought this would be a requirement for the GOP..
Okay? Now, what about Sexton?
Typical republicunt
Typical Republican behaviour....no surprise here.
But they expelled 2 representatives for a peaceful protest. Wtf.
Rules for thee but not for me lol
Is it any wonder they all want to change the laws . It's to protect their criminal behaviours
I bet he claims to be Christian.
Omg,why would anyone vote for that man? He’s repulsive.
Lol here comes the smear campaigns.  Look at clinton, biden,  coumo, and the list goes on. None of that changes the fact that the expeled members lead a protest march into the house chamber if the where GOP channel 5 would be cheering
WHATS IN THAT CUP? He carries it everywhere.  My guess: Not coffee.  And my other guess is that his fellow um legislators know what is in it and that was a major reason this happened so suddenly. :-)
WOW, quietly behind the scenes he's reprimanded, disgusting.  Hypocrisy at its finest.
Go down the list and investigate all of them
Living in a glass house and throwing stones at somebody else is a bad idea!
Lol Ironic
😂
In the game you do not want to win.... Low life Republicans 1 - 0 Drag Queens
I hope they fall like Dominos
Good journalism, but disingenuous/ click bait headline and framing. Imagine the hilarity of (President who passed the affordable care act, assassinates 16 year old on foreign soil).  Way to seem impartial guys.
My goodness another gop criminal and liar
Should anyone be shocked that this is the normal GOP bull crap that would come out of them like this.
WHAT, another GOP hypocritical scumbag...... Color me unsurprised!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All predators think they’re doing nothing wrong until they’re caught
Cameron Sexton's kingdom is falling
GOP  candidates are  retarded
The Grand Old Pervert Party!   Nothing but creeps.
Propaganda
The GOP. We investigated our selves and found that we did nothing wrong . Sure the mafia also never committed  any crimes and  they were outstanding businesman man who made money legally 😉🤣🤣🤣🤣.
He votes to expel for a disruptive protest, but has been a perv the whole time??? 😂😂😂 this is republicans 😂😂😂😂
The KKK is finally getting exposed in Tennessee and I'm extremely happy about that.
Never fear the GOP will show you who they really are… eventually… All pro life and shhht, but once you’re “lookin hood” they will be all over ya!!
Channel 5 looks so different since andrew got busted
He drips incel energy.
Looks like this guy was desperately in need of a few BUD LIGHT's when confronted.
Listen to this perverted scumbag. No shame at all. This is who voters elect to represent them. So he engages in perverted conduct and votes to expel two African American lawmakers. This is the political system we have. Two African Americans can be expelled for protesting repugnant gun violence that's killing our children in droves but a white degenerate lawmaker can sexually harass interns and be allowed to resign.
Weldone to this channel all the way from Md. 👏👏👏 these politicians think they are above the law, and it seems like they do get away with a lot. I wish they all would have to go through polygraph test to get a seat in public office.
Republicans are all trash.
Can't say I feel sorry for the intern 😂 republicans deserve eachother.
This is just too creepy to watch.
Finally some true journalism instead of partisan BS.
These damn Republicans are nothing but hypocrites
Republiscum
The GOP is full of fckn perverts and pedophiles.
Well, well, well...
More republican family values
Bye Felicia........😂😅
This is the press doing the job that the leadership refused to do. Everyone needs to support a newspaper with a subscription.
Rethuglican groomer. There are MANY MORE.
Good!…..I will boycott Tennessee until, they start treating the residents with dignity and give them human their rights back….
Oh wow, Karma’s turnaround time was unmatched on this one‼️👀
Thank you Channel 5 NEWS, for putting the NEWS in NEWS!
The real story is why did his fellow GOP members not vote to expel him with the sense of urgency in which they did with the Tennessee Three. Blatant Hypocrisy!
Ah, the party of family values strikes again.
Scratch a racist, find a predator. Do we really think there's no correlation between people who want to restrict the human rights of anyone, and give the ability for adults to legally abuse children in child marriages, and the idea that they themselves want all of these things?
At least he talked to the reporter no matter what he said.  Gets an F for ef-fort.
Womp-womp
Another Maga racist bigot bites the dust later Maga idiot
He resigns for “consensual talking”. ….he is too embarrassed to admit he crossed a line….so he repeats the same line of defense….what a sleaze bag ! I am sure there is more of this and other immature and sad behavior in the “ good ole boys” environment of that institution that we don’t know about…..yes, the GOP party took its  time to charge and censure him….much more than was given to the three Democratic legislators who were expelled for the crime of being aloud and vocal while joining parents and children protesting the weak gun laws that contribute to the killing of school children…..hypocrisy and arrogance is alive and well.
GOP stands for Good'Ol Predators
So, expelling the black man led to him resigning. I hope all the other racists on the house learn a lesson.
Sociopathic behaviors, such as those consistently seen among the elite, wealthy and the GOP,  are not limited to just the political behaviors and actions seen in public...it comes out in every part of these monsters'  lives...We are always seeing the GOPers having these types of double-life incidents...
Lok.....five seconds , get a sip of some Tennessee Whiskey .....wash down my shame
What goes around comes around!!! 😊
The rules never apply to GOP - according to GOP.  Everyone should be ripped to pieces if there is any hint of impropriety - unless they are members of GOP, when nothing tbey do must ever be described as improper.  GOP really is a swamp of stinking foulness.
Omg I am so shocked…. NOT!!!! They will always try and get rid of a blk man, but predators they can stay
Tennessee GOP not looking too good lately
The Republicans are kurupt,creeps,criminals,racists,hypocritesand religious zealots. They expelled them because they were black. Plain and simple all the while this guy was doing this stuff and none of them said anything.
A fat creepy white guy.. yep thats a racist american alright
Damn, it’s always a Republican. You have to admit if you’re honest that at least on paper Republicans in leadership have a super majority when it comes to getting caught being perverts, pedophiles or just plainly criminal. It’s like it’s woven into their ideology to either control or sexually harass woman. Are democrats just better at hiding their criminal activities?
Kudos this journalist and his team.  A. This guy looks and sounds like he's lying. Member's of his own Republican party found him guilty of what he's lying about to this reporter. They just kept it hidden.  The TN GOP doesn't care about kids on any level. They hid this GOP member who sexually harassed a 19yr old intern neighbor! You think they care about your kids?!  Time to register to vote and get ppl who represent your values, not your fears
Oh my.
He’s so convinced of his privilege and protection that he nearly shits himself when confronted openly and fairly in public, then of course reverts back to the default setting of lying, lying, lying when the actual FACTS are thrown in his face. That reporter deserves a medal.
Nobody want to fk an unseasoned tub of lard
I think they need to include that reporter's statement, "One does not get written up for conversations," in the legislature's sexual harassment training video. 😁
He doesnt know what a friend is 😂😂
Can we impeach Biden already that criminal! Mainstream media has zero credibility  or journalistic integrity if they did they would be going after Biden like they did trump!
Go figure😂
Family values😂
Rethuglicans are MASTER PROJECTIONISTS!  THEY are and have ALWAYS been the pedophiles in our midst.
OneAnd he expects people will believe him. His mama didn’t raise a fool. He learned to ball by himself.
Democrats are the Cult of brainwashed zero common sense Woke hypocrites!  Liberals would love to have men in woman locker rooms and compete against them in sports!! No common sense and of course no morals.    Do have to say this republican is not above the law and he is a scumbag if he did what he did.     Shouldn’t matter what party u align yourself too a scumbag is a scumbag
Like most republicans, he truly believes his version of reality.
GOOD. What.  A terrible man all around.
Lmaoffffff,  her father and brothers should be livid.
Fk the gop. Such a 💩 show full of hateful grifters and their podcasts
"How dare you work for me and have sex with others and not me" that's what I got from this
Very excellent reporting... KUDOS 👏🏿
Meal team 6, look at him. Overweight,  short, and I bet he has one of those stickers on his car that says I STAND FOR THE ANTHEM AND I KNEEL FOR THE CROSS, LMAOFFFFFF.
Look at him. I'm not surprised he is a pedophile!!!!
Never vote republican. They are the worst.
Phil Williams reminds of the legend Rob Wolchek from Detroit. Keep chipping away at these hypocrites, sir - we might weed them out.
Tennessee.. The most gerrymandered state in the country! Along with every state in the so called “Bible belt”!! Nothing but liars and hypocrites!
I thought they all hated Bill Clinton
Why do over weight politicians think that they can do and say anything that they want to the opposite sex?
WOW! GOP really means GRABBERS OF PUZZY!!!!
😂😂😂
Karma is a Bitch If you didn't do it then why you Resigned
typical republican, lazy, weak, overweight pedophile
Well done TN GOP. You vote to expel 2 black members because they are defending little kids yet you hold a "secret" meeting and vote to expel a predator among your own. I can't help but see the GOP every time I clean my rear with toilet paper. Disgusting and dirty.
A RepubLIEcan sexually harassing women? Nothing new here, they are so evil.
That's bold behavior. My guess this is not his first sexual harassment incident.
Shocker gop are hypocrites
these folks lmao
Lock his ass up Sex offender 😂😂😂😂
Why do ANY young people want to intern with the GOP?
Draining the swamp was a good idea but as usual, it was coming from the swampiest people on Earth. It's good to see it in action here.
How many GOP members In the United States are gonna be exposed for the dirty disgusting crimes that they do and you people continuously keep supporting them. Yet you want to say it's the other party. Wake the Hell up America!
Republicans showing who they are.  No one should be shocked, Maddison Cathern said he was invited to orgies and cocaine parties in the US congress.  Alex Alexzander wanted nudes for his political reach, where do you guys think they learn this from?
😂😂😂😂😂😂 pervert I believe the women
Now how about the leadership that covered this up? The only reason he resigned or faced any consequences was because the media outed it all. The state GOP leadership was perfectly happy to let him keep his position.
"it's all about the he said she said bullshit"
Oh no! A Republican is a double-faced pervert! I'm shocked!
Why do you need to be told that you have crossed the line! You shouldn't be approaching the line, especially with a young intern! Power dynamics.
Al Franken 2.0 . MSNBC will probably hire this guy like they did Franken.
Karma at its finest
The Expeller becomes the Expelled. Sweet karma.
Just another day with republicans! Good job america 😂
Oh how the turn tables....😂
🤣🤣🤣 I bet they regret what they did now everyone are being investigated
Where on earth would we be without responsible journalism? Oh I forgot. We would have an insurrection fueled by propagandists right-wing media. Thank you for exposing this horrible legislator and his violation of policy.
The GQP way , lie,lie and lie some more . Wake up people, don’t you want people representing you that have ethics.
How long has this BOZO been a Drag Queen??? Never, you say? I find this completely believable, how about you?
It's cute that GOP Fat F*ck thinks 19 year olds are hot for him.
GOP groomers caught red handed.
Lets just say ALL THE REPUBLICANS STANCE ON "FAMILY VALUES and of being the SENTRIES on GAURD PROTECTECTING the virginal attributes of america and railing against gender identity and pronouns and book banning and right to life and all their other bullshit is just that,.B U L L S H I T!
Is anyone even remotely surprised by this?
Tennessee Republican logic……Sexually harassing and making unwanted comments to an Intern totally Ok….Participate in a protest to denounce gun violence is totally unacceptable!!!!
GQP at its finest!
Another member of the "GOD, COUNTRY, AND FAMILY-VALUES party. " POS. Now, the tax-payer has to foot the bill---again.
This station is definitely NOT a "Fox affiliate" It's funny Tennessee Republikkkons are against discussions for gun reform but sexual assault is perfectly OK.
This is disheartening when lawless people are voted as lawmakers. We the voters really need to do a lot of findings about our candidates before the elections from now on. Leave out all your biases when you vote.
Some slow down dirty folks in both parties but the Republican party boy. They go super super super low. Bullhorns on the floor get people expelled sexual harassment in the work place. You keep your job. The party says nothing about it and this is just how they do on the resatuation they all got skeletons
Karma gave him a "Lewinski" 😆🤣😆🤣
The pail man is the Lucifer there race under rebirth rate America going brown black nothing y’all can do stop touching people talk touch your own family’s
Did he resign because he sexually molested interns or did he resign because he fired 2 bomb throwing BLM dems?  Inquiring minds want to know! ❤️🙏
The "family values" party. Fuck 'em
I love hearing a biased ass liberal who has to say republican in every sentence mentions about something costing tax payers money. Local news is obviously just as bad as national.
Well, there’s a big surprise! That’s an incredible—I think I’m going to have a heart attack and die from that surprise! 🙄
Nothing funnier than watching a professional Republican’s life crumble. He doesn’t deserve a single ounce of sympathy.
Interesting way to change the discussion. This is a separate issue.
Ha ha ha ha ha hahahaha ha! 😂😂😂😂😂 Ha!
Wow I’m surprised he resigned. These days, Republicans typically double down on their disgraceful conduct.
Get'em Phil
...always remember...when it comes to Republicunts...  ...ignore their hyperbole...and whatever they accuse the other side of doing, they're telling you what they're currently doing behind your back...
OK but the Tennessee three  were still acting like a bunch of idiots. This has nothing to do with what happened….. They have no decorum and no class.
Nice to see that real investigative journalism still exists. Kudos to your team. Keep it up!!!
They're Republicans....what else needs saying?
This one got my skin crawling.
Russia taking out DC would be a blessing to all😂😂
the grooming projection of republicans is astounding
Get all of those corrupt and crooked no common sense racist politicians out of office.
Uh oh...😮😅😊
"Consensual adult conversation"?  WTF. Dude - It doesn't matter if you're on government property or on or off the clock. As long as you're in a position of power over your interns, that shit DOES NOT HAPPEN. As far as this asshole keeping his position after being found guilty, there should be repercussions further up the food chain.
The old "bottomless tumbler trick". Loser
Sounds great to me. That's what you get when you try to be the devil.
Sigh.....surprise, surprise 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Obviously this specimen of the Tenn GOP doesn't condemn the lack of THAT kind of decorum! Totally cool with that. 🙄
guess sexual harassment is less abhorrent than racial discrimination....perfect exit
that guy is a groomer pos. there you go republicans. go get him. send the proud boys
One less check the NRA will have to write
Bye bye perv.
With " friends " like him, who needs enemies? The slug is a walking Red Flag !
Good old church boy
Republicans sexuals harassment's, voter fraud, sexual trafficking kids, hush money, rape, and some were even on Epstein island. ALL ARE WHITE REPUBLICAN MEN! THIS IS ALL A FACT. ITS BEEN ON ALL OVER THE NEWS. Who's THE TRUE WEAK FREAKS, SICKOS AND DEPRAVED.
Easy Way to get rid of many politicians  ?  Wouldn’t be many left ? Shades of Fang Fang ? 🤔
He should get  with M.T.G I hear she's available😊
And yet they haven't expelled him
This is why we need local news! well done!
Please!  As if this has ANYTHING to do with those 3 idiots needing removed!!  Yeah, this guys a creep, but those 3 still needed to be GONE!
Ha Ha 😅😅😅
Tara Reid.
GOP hypocrisy, they pass laws promoting "conservative values" and they are "dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord"  The GOP is a mess! and they will take the country down into a $hithole. Stop voting for BS, vote BLUE, so our elected officials can get back to governing the country, for the people, instead of  working for corporations and lobbyist representing guns and the 1 percenters.
Definitely got those how to catch a predator vibes
Great reporting
He's such a dumbass... he's all. "Wait, I can't sexually harass people I work with EVEN when I'm not clocked in?"
✊🏿
ANOTHER Republican in America doing perverted or demented things?? Something is not well with white, male, Republicans! This includes the anchors at FOX, many of whom were fired or resigned due to sexual assault or harassment!
Is it wrong to say “hmmm, not surprising, are politicians getting worse and worse or is reporting getting better and society less tolerant of crappy behaviour”
LOL ....People who live in glass houses ... Should NOT throw stones ⁉️🙄 ....Guess this Republican needs to go back to school and get his GED❓
