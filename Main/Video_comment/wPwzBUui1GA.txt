I saw this movie on Christmas Day a few years ago. It was great! My friend and I went to see it together. She passed about a year ago.
I never thought fantasia barrino would be here.. She's my favourite singer
Lorrrrd! You know Candace Owens is Nettie! 😁
I cried buckets...og my
In December 22 2023
Why so many dislikes? I know nothing about it, I'm just surprised to see the disparity.
D. ROSS.  NEVER WILL  BE ANYONE LIKE YOU ❤ 👸
❤
EPIC😮❤😢😅😂❤
Just watched it on Netflix. So damn good!
Never have I ever seen a remake as power as the original. But baybee... This is the one. This was absolute perfection. I am so mad I didn't see it in the theater. I was detoured when they said it was a musical. But this is not a musical. It is pure black culture baby. ❤
Thank you, Netflix! I savored this film twice at the cinema. So why, after watching it at home, am feeling that it's just as touching --perhaps even more stellar--on the small screen?
I remember this
Movie name - Hidden Figures
I am currently reading yhe novel,from which this movie os based on, I will see this after I finish reading
People say that you can't remake a classic like The Godfather or Casablanca because the cast is irreplaceable. That's how I feel about The Color Purple. Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah are Celie and Sophia. I know that it's an adaptation of the Broadway show but you can't beat the original. Steven Spielberg crafted a masterpiece that shouldn't be touched.
The color purple?! They should call it the color black!! There’s no purple in this thing!
A young woman
Someone liked this movie and always bought purple cigarette lighters
I feel bad for Taraji   who is a A lister actor paired alongside a loser like Fantasia ...I guess y'all all forgot what a homewrecker she is you don't break up a marriage and then expect good things to happen...the movie flopped big time .
This trailer is not very diverse. 👎
_Thank You Victoria Police Racism._
The best trailer I ever seen
I love the original. It have no special effects or other thing that could be improved in 2023. Why the F*ck doing the exact same movie again?!! This display of lack of creativity deserves failure, not of the film but of the entire studio.
Saw this movie today. I cried so much my heart hurts. Loved it so much.❤
A mess!
I Watch This With My Family And Love IT 10-10 IMPRESSIVE Excellent 💯
Couldn't watch this version for long. Oprah's idea of making this movie into a musical was, in my opinion, a joke. It was as good as Beloved. Maybe just act in movies Oprah. Your movie ideas are stupid. But aren't we all a critic. The original was by far an excellent movie. This one is a stinker.
it is hard to do a musical without inducing cringe too much. this movie took itself too serious and the result were musical scenes where you think who the f thinks that is cool?   and i was dissapointed that the black people in this movie talked like illiterate ghetto youtubers.
I. Like it.
I watched The Color Purple 1985 and loved it. This one looks brighter but more like a musical and I am not a fan of musicals in general.
KINGS AND QUEENS WE ARE THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE 🙏🏾 SHALOM FAMILY 🙌🏾👏🏾💯😢
Such important topics and such a classic turned into to a musical I don’t like it
i hate musicals. i just dont understand how you can take a great movie and turn it into singing. i dont get how anyone can take a movie serious when your singing. they should have remade the movie not the musical. how there are so many positive comments i will never understand. well just look how bad it did in theaters proves im not in the minority.
I’m a little late. But why in the world they didn’t keep this trailer version of the song for the movie? I mean, the last part in the trailer is so amazing I want to cry. And I know they were just trying to remake the original song, but cmon, this was the shot 🙌🏼😹
I never liked how they try to make the brothers seem like the worst of the worst but I’m going check it out still
Who cares about fantasia I care about the story. America was a horrible place and you can’t earase that.
Looks absolutely garbage
Omggggg 😢😮
We studied it on school
What a beautiful film ! 🥹
Wow
Fantasia's voice!! ❤

The Colour Purple.
I really want to watch this movie.
This was a lovely movie. Shed some tears n all.
the old one is better
a great musical

❤❤❤ I Love You Jesus and Enjoying This Movie Today July 13 2024. Reminds Me OF The Love Jesus Has Given me Every day and Second.
Ughhhh a musical…why?  I’m already sure it’s not going to be right. Choreographed dance etc..voids the authenticity from what was a spectacular movie. Ughh.
The woman can sing but she's no Cynthia Erivo. I'm sorry to this movie but Cynthia made that song untouchable
Win 🤩 because nothing  look but my mother blood head 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
shug avery looks absolutely phenomenal
Oprah Winfrey
Just finished watching it finally. Now I know why I didn't kill myself to go see it at the cinema. It had elements that I liked but overall very disappointed 😢. Now it's confirmed to me that reality TV is what these generations are good at. Creativity of old for me; is truly dead.😢 That's for me. I'm sure most of you are okay with mediocre.❤❤❤ Love the lead talents individually. No blame there.
underrated
Idgaf
How can I see this in Australia?
Well this was a box office sucess, eh? As it should be 😎
VIP was getting really ran thru.
Why isn't Nettie Harris a white redhead? Oh! That wouldn't be suitable for the role, right? It would be very stupid to change her original ethnicity, wouldn't it? ...
Oprah, Spielberg and Quincy Jones....no thanks 😮
those who came here because of their fav colour is purple and live in Africa  👇
if you have read the book yourself then please do not watch this movie, by only watching the trailer i can tell that the movie would not even be half as good as the book was.
I remember sitting in the theater last year and this trailer came on before the movie. I started crying. I went on to see this movie 3 times in theaters.
I Watched This Movie For The First Time Last Night And It Was Fantastic Best Showing Of The Color Purple Ever
画面感太美了
This looks great! I loved the original movie and this looks like a new musical version. Getting ready to watch this on DVD now.
Real woman there...and equals.  You know your place ....which is a balanced area at the dinner table .
What was wrong with the 1982 The Color Purple? Why did it need to be remade? Why are classics being remade? Did Hollywood run out of ideas?
1:57 good god, Halle Bailey has the weirdest eyes.  They're too small and too far apart. 🤣🤣🤣
I really want to see this
Just bought it going to be good
¡LO SIENTO PERO NO. QUE ES ESTE HORROR!  "El Color Púrpura" original fue una película QUE MARCO LA VIDA DE MILLONES DE PERSONAS no solo en USA sino alrededor del mundo. Pudimos ver de una manera descarnada LOS HORRORES DE LA DISCRIMINACIÓN RACIAL no contados desde un punto de vista eurocéntrico, sino de la visión de los negros estadounidenses. Convertir "El Color Púrpura" en un músical barato lleno de purpurina flaco favor le hace a ESTE CLÁSICO DEL CINE DE LOS OCHENTA. Si querían hacer un HOMENAJE a dicha película hubiera respetado la trama original y haber mostrado aquello que en 1985 no se podía mostrar: los abusos de no solo miles de miles de mujeres, que decir mujeres, niñas negras y blancas vivían al ser "casadas" con hombres mayores en sur y oeste de USA, los horrores del sistema de apartheid de Jim Crow que en la película original se muestran someramente con el brutal asalto a Sofia, el movimiento de ENGATUZAMIENTO al que fueron sometidos miles de ciudadanos negros para irse a vivir a Liberia solo para descubrir que no teninn ya nada que ver con África y convertirse en los nuevos amos de ese país, en como a pesar de todo esto miles de ciudadanos negros estadounidenses trabajaron, estudiaron, montaron negocios y salieron adelante como lo hizo Celie. Convertir al "El Color Púrpura" en un "Chicago" es lo más patético que tanto Spielberg director original como Ophra [Sofía] pudieron hacerle a este magna obra, es como ponerle un disfráz barato.
Meh. I think the book is better than both movies. Taraji P. Hensen and David Allen Grier singing together was beautiful and I wish they would do a musical project together.
The purple color really deserved that award 🎉🎉🎉
Por que siguen insistiendo en hacer nuevas versiones de algo que ya es bueno. De verdad los escritores no tienen ideas o qué esta pasando?
Movie sucked! Original was better.
Not really into musical but this was really good. Made a grown man (me) cry
Something special.... Bravo! ❤ Thank you for the love put into it regardless of   the conflict over wages. They deserved everything they asked for fair wages, fair treatment, and a loyalty beyond measure.
I never write anything on YouTube or whatsoever platform but I got to say for this masterpiece I must say I went into every emotions (mostly crying throughout most of the movie tho but that's fine lol). The songs are incredible and already downloaded the album on Spotify!!! I have loved everything about this art! Please make yourself a favor and watch it if you like musicals. Big love on Fantasia that I thought was incredible and unique in this. 10 out of 10 for me
The black community need help with housings,foods,clothes health care and transportation. Where are you poverty with new money now. Let us help. 33 pesos.❤🎉😢
I think I'll stick to the original Color Purple. Every time there is a movie remake it's never as good as the original and I can tell by the preview that this is not going to be as good.
The movie was a box office bomb despite all the heavy advertising and Oprah. It cost WB to lose 40 million.
Bravo to all remakes Steven Spielberg excellent as usual along with cast and crew❤❤❤❤
I wish I had known ahead of time that it was a musical. I was completely disappointed. Not at all what I expected. I feel like they should've put that somewhere in the title. Just my opinion. I do like musicals but because I wasn't expecting it and wasn't in the mood for it it totally ruined it for me.
The blackest Christmas... brought to you by Steven Spielberg of course. Let's squeeze in as many stereotypes as possible. Oh, all black women are queens too. Shameful!
1985 original still unsurpassed.
Why Yall Watching this
It was a good movie but did not reach the emotional mark the first film did.  I cried watching the first one.  This is a musicle so a completely different vibe.  You'll tap your feet to the music and the experience is completely different.  Worth a watch.
They need to remake Boys N The Hood & Menace ll Society.. FRFR
Too many ads for this wow
Hailey Bailey slayed that trailer I didn't know she was in it
I didn't think I would like this because the original film really upset me. With all the beatings and calling Celie ugly, it hit too close to home for me. But I really liked this, the singing really softened the blow of all the domestic violence.
Fuq this movie 👎
WB... You really messed up with all the mimiermakeup thing. You could have hired a Black influencer, ANY of them on the platform. Also Mirta lost completely the point of the movie... Like man, she said she found the movie INSPIRING and HEARTWARMING, wth. It was a dickmove fr.
I don't know why but the way the says "Drinks on the howesss" is extremely annoying!
Americans... 🕳
love this movie it made me cry
GOOD MOVIE
STILL prefer the one with Whoopie better. It's just a more enjoyable movie and has brilliant acting. Sorrry......
Another movie that Promotes homosexuality and refers to Black Men as “beasts”.  Great job Hollyweird 😂  I know 2 much
This movie flopped so hard, it sounded like a fish smacking on a dock.   No. Some movies don't need to be "re-made" or "re-imagined", Hollywood.
Awful remake on a black male hate movie. No one asked for it that's why it flopped. Stop pushing this filth
What’s the original name, the same ?
I hear the black actresses from this movie feel abused and taken advantage of. Nothing new for Oprah, nothing new at all.
Why it's free to watch
Warner Bros Shares ‘Plummet’ After ‘The Color Purple,’ Amber Heard’s ‘Aquaman 2’ Bomb
Christmas day????😮 That's a long friking time from now!!! WTF? Seriously? Almost a year wait? Or did you meant Christmas 2023?
The original movie will always remain the best version.
So hilarious this movie tanked 😂😂
Good Gawd🤮
I can not believe the actors got paid so little for this movie!!!   I really thought they  each were paid millions each,  CAN NOT BLAME white people for this!    "Proud Mary".  You  should have been paid 5 million
It was ok.  It failed at the box office...
Try replacing the race of this story 😳😳😳 like ya do white classics 🤬
Not necessary, entitled people of Hollywood who have run out of material!! The first one was of a humbled being with a story, this is arrogant glory!! You can’t redo a classic OPRAH 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I enjoyed every Actor song and the work that was put into this Musical. 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
FANTASIA!!!❤🎉
Movie was more funny then sad lol
Nope… don’t like musicals. prefer the 1985 version.
Trying to display how evil black people are this is the reactions of the evil that was portrayed on us by white slavery
I'm so tired of these ignorant black slave movies when you're going to start making movies about getting Reparations
I am going to watch it today at AMC, its inspiring.
@novo_change ❤❤
I didn't like Fantasia's voice much back then when I watched American Idol many  years ago but now I think it improved so much. The theater training helped a lot, it's sound so beautiful to the ears. And Danielle Brooks, wow. I used to watched Orange is the New Black and now she's an Oscar nominee.  Just like what one of the top comments says, this is NOT A REMAKE of the 1985 movie, but this is based on the stage musical.
This was A Amazing Movie it Shows Alot from are own Culture A real Beautiful Movie
Outstanding movie!!!!!
Trash
I don’t like remakes. 1st one did not need a remake. I wonder why they didn’t race swap the main characters like they did with the little mermaid.
I love watchin them boys work! Make me money boy!
Fantasia had me crying all through the film. She is a phenomenal singer and actress. Her voice seems a little deeper and  just as incredible as ever.  I love her so much. I pray she wins an Oscar. She so deserves it 🙏🏽
awesome
This movie is 100 times better than the 1st one I loved it!
Same movie just a modern minded version. This one is horrible
The original was not a musical. And Whoopi’s sister was just as dark as she was. Light skin don’t make you more beautiful. They destroyed this movie and resent a horrible message.
Just watched this on Max and it was beautiful! Such a talented cast! Maybe this didn’t do well at the box office because sometimes people just aren’t interested in seeing ‘remakes.’   However, its lack of success at the box office certainly had nothing to do with the movie itself because I thought it was wonderful and beautifully done.   I absolutely loved it!
I cried 12 times. 😅😅😂😂❤❤
Not liking the musical in movie.. but good movie 🎬
Not like the original. A bit boring. Don’t expect an Oscar for this movie. I like the original much better.
I watched the trailer because I was interested but the cast already had me in my chair !
today I just learned of this remake I can't wait to see it
Such a great movie!!!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
If you get a chance to see this movie, it is dynamite. Taraji P, Danielle, Ciara, H.E.R, Fantasia, Holly, and all the cast were awesome, absolutely awesome.  I just watched it and to know what all those wonderful actresses went through to make this movie, made  my eyes about 5 times throughout the movie? Gotta see it❤
They stole the script and scenes from high school students who did an reenactment back in 2011. Lakewood High School students in Saint Petersburg, Florida. They thought 💭 we forgot. They made sure YouTube deleted the videos so they could keep lying and taking credit for other people's work. This version was just for play. The book 📖 is not like this.
Danny Glover was the BEST!
Can't beat the Original Movie
trash
I hate it 😒
Fantasia was INCREDIBLE in this. Award winning worthy for sure. Please give this queen her flowers 💐 ❤👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾
William Afton?
Da original seem so much more raw compared to dis..
I just got home from watching this movie. Amazing, and I can't wait to see it again. Nice to see Fantasia in this. Always loved her singing.
Time - to Feel Truth
Well done!!!! It is worth the hype. The three leading ladies really gave an Oscar performance. I only wished that more of the original cast would have made a cameo. I was so glad to see Whoopi. Hat off to Oprah, Steven, Quincy ,Blitz and Scott great job. Leave it to Oprah to bring the tree to full circle.
This movie was absolutely amazing!! I wanna rewatch it instantly
Just watch this film and 😢😢 it's a beautiful film. Balck people are amazing...one thing I can confirm is that we must never lose faith in God🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 he believe in us even when we don't believe in ourselves.  We are loved ❤❤
ADOLPH CAESAR. Enough Said. R.I.P. Bro.
Not for me. The original from 1985 cannot be any better. A brilliant film with an amazing cast. Can't watch this. I am so done with remakes!!! Just let things stand already...
WE WUZ KANGZ N QWEENZ.....😂😂😂
It had bits of the 1985 version,  but I  loved the new concept of the story, especially the new songs.
I saw this movie.     In my opinion this has Tyler Perry movie.    I have watched every Tyler Perry play and movie.   This is his film and basically he had a lot of doing directing the film and gave jones and Winfrey credit.    The man is an artist.    I feel Tyler Perry made this.   It is a great musical.
It's more a musical in my opinion, not what I expected.
Saw it yesterday, brilliant 👌
Main character should be ginger for representation
Stop comparing the movie to the old one. Just watch it for what it is. Gosh, you all are annoying.
What in the world Victor Strand doing in there???
The original film is incredible.. this however, is just different
so a movie with all-black casting is okay, but theres an outcry and outrage for diversity if a movie has an all-white casting? hypocrits
🛑 stop it please This trailer was too much viewed as a musical instead of a serious drama!  Among my peers many of us didn't want to go see the movie because the trailer glamorized with music instead a beautiful written drama by Alice Walker.      Somebody should have did their research before going through with this movie. And Spielberg did it right the first time!  This movie did not have to be remade.  Somebody want to brothers didn't do their homework ‼️‼️
This trailer inclusive trailer just gave me cancer...
Wow…that was THE best movie I’ve seen. Period. Not usually a big fan of musicals, but the music in this was brilliant. I’m astonished that it hasn’t garnered more award nominations. And this isn’t a black thing: I’m a 64-year-old white Aussie and it was just the best thing I’ve seen in years.
They sing to much . And I loved Hailey but I don’t feel that role fits her
least Oprah was a producer in it. Oprah was in the original
Where's the diversity????
This movie was horrible!!
I understand why no one went to see it now. I will pass
Hey there, bots! 👋😄
Amazing!
I watched it yesterday and I really like it. The movie is better than the trailer suggests.
gee what a flop.....no one goin to see this thing.....why u reckon????
This would be 1000% better if they  DId another one brought back all the original cast and made it a older story about the KIds returning from Africa !!!!!
whyy cant yall come up with new story lines????  always stealing from what was and remaking into new BS WITH ZERO TALENT
no se compara a la gran original
I'm still trying to get my head across on the original film how Whoopi Goldberg did that hand gesture sitting in 🤣🤣🤣.. like what was that
I liked it but i'm not a musical fan, had to skip those parts. But the last scene made me tear up just like in the OG version. It is different in its own right💯 but i hate musicals 😅
What was the need to make a new version?
Yeah what a way. Black man really hate black women in the minds of black women. I wonder if that fits reality. I ain't watching this s***
Watching the first color purple at a young age traumatize me and made me cry I can never bring myself to watch that movie again... the musical color purple was a great turn around... Danny clover l still don't like you and I don't watch the movies you're in no apology
I just watch the movie and I'm happy about the message it's giving a God's grace and mercy vibe and mama Africa at the ending thank you for making it affiliated with God and black ppl heritage movie well cast
This movie failed cause you can't remake a beautiful classic. I didnt want to watch it cause whoopi was the best.
Even if we have to part, you&me us have one heart 🌻
So Nettie ram from the father but Celine just kept having babies ? Uggh
Thai pissed me off ! Like why stay ? NETTIE LEFT !!
I just watched the movie 😢tears where just falling 😭. Great movie 🎬 indeed
The movie was bad because it was bad. Strayed too fat from the book, overlooked very important moments and themes, poor acting-especially Fantasia. The movie seemed rushed. Don’t turn serious stories into musicals.
All I have to say is wow...❤ I was moved to tears, that doesn't happen easily
TikyBenz youtube
I watched the movie! This is not a movie it's just a musical! Not my taste! 😢
Odio los musicales, pero esta película de verdad me conmovió
Wow Wow Wow. I’m so excited for this 🤗🔥🔥🔥
The colour purple is last season colour it be the colour pink.
WHY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????????? DOING THIS TO A SUCH A GREAT MOVIE !!!! SHAME ON YOU !!!!!!!! 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
O P R A H  pay ur CASTS n stop with the BS
Would like to see a white actor play this role..
HB looks  like an alien
I don't support anything with Oakra attached...plus the original can't be duplicated.
Where is the chocolate factory???
The cinematography was beautiful. For the most part, the singing was good. The acting wasn’t that good. Everything felt rushed and disconnected.
I just saw the movie and absolutely LOVED every single minute ❤ the original movie came out when I was in college and I’ve loved it ever since. Amazing job. 🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽
I’M SO GLAD THAT I DID NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE.. IT’S LIKE A BROADWAY SHOW.. a waste of money, but to each his own, I digress
So she's not a black ginger mermaid that lives under de sea..... Naah not diverse enough
I watched the new version of the colour purple??  They should of left it alone!!  The singing and dancing was turning me off and I was finding it hard to watch the movie   Should have left it, the original without singing and dancing 🤪 was so much better!!
I thought this was a bad idea for the big screen  I could not feel any emotion at all totally OTT with the  singing and dancing which I felt deviated from the original sad story  telling.
🇬🇭 Ghana
Yooo I can't with this singing and dancing at. It's too much
Rotten tomatoes is so full of sh. Ratings based on woke bs
IM NOT PAYING TO SEE BLACK WOMEN GET ABUSED AND STRUGGLE. MANY OF US ARE TIRED OF THIS MESS AND WANT TO SEE REGULAR FILMS WITH REGULAR HUMAN STORIES FEATURING BLACK WOMEN AND MEN.
I didn’t enjoy this movie. I liked the voices, but it doesn't have the soul the original had. Fantasia is a terrible actress also. My goodness.
So technically i've watched this movie already just not the 2023/4 one
Haha I’m glad this movie bombed. I get that it’s not the original, but then they should have named it something different. You BWs have warn out any kind of sympathies that anyone had for you. No more lies. Let’s keep this trend going for the foreseeable future 😂
Watch “the color purple” movie from 1985 great movie
As a lover of the OG. I thought this was AMAZING! Yes some of the scenes didnt hit as hard imo but it was all stiil there. I really enjoyed it and yes i knew it was a musical before going in. ❤
I wont watch this movie the original is too perfect
We are not slaves. We are children of God.  This is brainwashing.
Advice: stop making slave movies & defiling black people towards God. This is so wrong on so many levels.  End of Hollywood.
😂
I’m disgusted at the lack of diversity.
This was trash
Looks kinda good , too bad sein Taraji jst makes me think she didn't get paid 😅 buzz Killa
This movie speaks and highlights of self respect and dignity beyond ties of family, culture, and institutions...  Thus, if those connections would serve only as reference but not truly as bridge to overcross trouble and violence, the presendence of the social inequality continues to remain bias and superficial since death is the number one priority of domestic violence derived by anger management..  There's a peaceful solution for few of the characters however not for all, even with sisterhood the gap is still visible even in this magnific story..  Thank you writers for making public concious of this topic in very artistic manner..  Incredible cast! #WarnerBrosPictures #TheColorPurple #OfficialTrailer #2023 #2024USA❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Straight to VHS 📼 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just here to say I told ya so 😂😂😂😂 MAJOR FLOP
i can say the color black that will be more movie
we should all pass on this movie after hearing how low most of the actors were paid   { IE: Teraji P. Henson and more who wont speak out } thanks to Oprah Winfrey shame on her.
The movie blows!!
Taraji, fight for what is right!!!! ❤❤❤❤
I hope this comes to max
Like shooting fish in a barrel.
wow this looks really good, well done!
Songs are good but not the movie
Where whoopi at???? yo where whoopi?? I no you didn't make no purple without whoopi?? where whoopi????
The option for her sister and her children at the end were very weak compared to others.
I like the movie, didn’t love it 🤪. I don’t like Fantasia speaking and singing voice. I wish her well, she is talented, but her voice to my years 🤪🤪🤪. Jennifer Hudson would be a better option by far ❤
La gran hipocresía de hollywoke.
Powers
I'm a bit skeptical about a musical version or any other version really, of the original movie. It almost seems to be sacrilege because the original movie is a masterpiece. But after seeing the trailer, I might give it a go and watch it at least one time.
❤it can't wait to see it
I dont understand the beef. If you was treated unfair why be part of it? The movie is not even something to cry over for. I've seen movies much better. And besides it's a movie that already exists. I hate remakes reboots of any kind
luckily I love musicals but this feels like a bait and switch...these movie companies are driving me crazy with not being up front about what we are actually signing up to see
The original movie broke my heart am so tired of that story but the fact that this is a musical is actually a good thing
How come diversity didn't cast this as all white, or Asian or Indian?
Geese there so ugly and just fuel there own self esteem to be crushed by the reality of how most people and other ethnicities react to them. It’s really sad. Taraji is the only one I like. And please keep the musicals shorter and rare.
I would of liked the main character to be played by a white woman,you know like when they race swap white historical ones .
Having not read the book, watched the original ,I'm guessing this is more white guilt.... quickly look who directed it ....just as I suspected.
A movie like this can't win any academy awards these days, breaks all the diversity rules.
This by far has been the worst promotional tour of any movie. The drama was louder than the actual movie premiere. This is so embarrassing for the black community.
Omg this looks so amazing and I can’t wait to watch it!!!
This is a masterpiece and I just finished watching it and, wow, I was moved to tears from the start. It deserves to be a winner at the Oscars. The best heritage musical in decades. It is brilliantly empowering,the songs are just outspoken, the cast is out of this earth. It needs more recognition and needs to win big. ❤ 🙏👏👏👏👏
Well, I’ve had some trepidation with some of the scenes at the start, but as an African the ending part of the movie felt like a slap in the face, an a first generation African in US. How come the children (children) , because they are coming from Africa look weary and older than both their mom and aunt? Was the intention to portray African as weary with wrinkles instead of that youthful of African and sign of a bright future?
I enjoyed this today 1/13/2014 by myself. Husband didn't want to go or anyone else. Just me & GOD 🙏 🎉❤ 3HOURS OF ENJOYING THIS!
Just watched this movie and I absolutely hated it🤬WAAAAAAY to many changes and dancing music like it is a damn musical. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED
How come Halle isn’t on the press tour as well as the other cast members
Watching this with my adult eyes had me wanting to really box Albert aka Mister
this musical movie was AMAAAZZING!!! I almost stayed in the theater to watch it again, but i had to go cook food for the family. Fantasia SSAAAANNNNGGGGGGG baby we were clapping and there were teary eye parts!!!!
Didn't see the first one not seeing this one 😂
Bravo. Excellent job. Full of heart felt atmosphere and beauty.  Everything, everyone, in front, behind the scenes and the vision of it was magnificent 👌🏼 👏🏼 💯❤️☝🏼
I just watched the movie today and goodness was it amazing. I laughed, I cried - I was totally immersed in it every second of it.
💜phnonomal can't wait  watch it
The original in my opinion is the best black movie of all time
It should be boycotted. Seems that Oprah was willing to pay the White actresses more than the Black actresses. Despicable.
Why did they remove the line where Shug called Celie ugly? That was the best line in the movie.
Disgraceful remake. Watch the original instead
If you liked The Color Purple , check these out: 1. Tulip Fever (2017 film) 2. For Colored Girls (2010 film) 3. August: Osage County (2013 film) 4. 7 Khoon Maaf (2011 film) 5. Why Did I Get Married? (2007 film) ... Visit Stryvia to find your next favourite!
My Grandmother told me "don't believe what people tell you, Celie was a rich thin white woman".
🗑️ trash
I love Taraji and Fantasia BUT I will not be watching this movie as my boycott to how they were not treated right PLUS, I'm not a fan of Oprah.....
Not worth the watch
from the most virtue signaling producers Hollywood ever created
It'll do if you like musicals I'm sorry it sucked to me I couldn't get into it at all
This would have been better if it was made into animated cartoon
I saw the movie and loved the final product.   The way Warner Bros chose to treat the talent is absolutely despicable. Oprah is taking the brunt of the blame but she was not the production team and showrunner. You cut corners that should never have been cut now no one wants to support the film.
SUCH AN AMAZING MOVIE!!! I want to go see it again! And I just watched it yesterday.
So are people hating on this because it hides the hard awful truths or because... Well i cant think of more reasons.. please tell me.
Pls where can I watch?? Netflix? Prime? Where???
Is this yet another slave story that shows how bad black people got it and how evil white people are. And how incredibly black people overcame their situation to be the great people that they are? Save me the tears..
This movie like the first one brings out so many emotions. You’re laughing one minute and crying the next and I’m just now seeing the trailer and got emotional. A definite must see❤❤❤
I've only recently become aware that this was made, and I'm glad they didn't just do a straight remake of it. I'm glad it appears to have been a musical. Looks fun and enjoyable.
What's up white America with these slave movies and the black people still playing them? All these fake paid likes. There 26k dislikes.
No dressing rooms, no security, no drivers  for actors;.....totally disgusting!
Biggest snub in the 2024 Golden Globes!
This movie made my heart sing 💜💜💜 so beautiful
Taraji never disappoints.
Please don’t hate me but this movie was not good at all. I was not impressed. The cast was top notch though.
I absolutely loved it...I laughed...I cried..and I cussed Mister 😅😅😂😂😊
Huge shout out to waner brothers for doing absolutely nothing to promote  this movie .
I would LOVE to see this movie… I just don’t want to give my money to Oprah! 🤮 Taraji is an AMAZING actress & many other women in this movie as well… it’s a double edge sword!
Y'all are going to throw tomatoes at me, but Fantasia disappointed me. Tarajii sounded better, and Fantasia over acted. Ciara did good, too.  I didn't recognize her until the credits rolled.
I steal and underpay the movie
I hate it when our men are depicted ugly. The men in my life are heroes.
They messed up the original. BP are native to their lands. Too much singing and scenes where it wasn’t necessary or fit the scene. Bp had way more businesses back in the early 1900’s than we do today. Smh!  Shug and Celie were not lesbians in the original and did not have that type o f connection. Stop trying to emasculate the bm in every movie. Women wore nothing but dresses in the original movie and was proud to be feminine in a dress. They also portrayed the bm so violent, submissive to the wm and drunk. Back in those days we know there were plenty of rebellions and resistance. Show us who was really terrorizing those poor families and rampant racism was. Don’t paint it as a pretty picture.
Why is this a musical 😢
I like the original version better,   In high School we when to musicals all the time, and they were boarding to me. Never like them an I still don't like musicals.😢😢😢
So stupid why remake a classic definitely passing non the the first one was great enough
This movie is disgusting and this is why we are lost as a people. Yah (God) did not bless this, but your own wicked hearts did.
I would prefer original as my favorite 😍 😌 😊
I supported this film, I did my part.
I've just got a massive shiver down my spine ❤. X
I just came from seeing the movie and I loved it so much! I laughed, I cried; I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the music! Amazing! I foresee awards in the future.
I’m almost 0.5 miles away from full eye contact with the little mermaid 😅
HER♥️
@DDG
The original ....❤❤❤❤❤..this ..yawn.. 😅😅😅
Does anyone know why Boosie  got upset about the movie??
😂 Boosie
Another inclusive movie and fake reviews! It breaking record yea sure!
This must be most boring film in 2024😂
This is not a movie that should have been recreated to begin with I'm tired of black shows and keep pushing this into people's heads that's the way it is nowadays
😂
The original movie was perfect.  This new one has nowhere to go except the disappointment pile.
H.E.R. 😍
im not interested....but loved the first movie....might read the book instead of seeing this musical.
H.E.R   ❣️✨   Love you babe !
Without watching trailer I predict no singing in trailer.
Some things just needs to be left alone! The original is excellent it simply is on another level! I still hate Danny Glover in every other movie because of the Color purple,  It's a insult when the main characters are still alive
I wish tajati p Hansen work a purple dress with purple lipstick drinking grape wine and also chewing grape bubble gum
Don’t take your kids….I REPEAT DO NOT…….this is a colorful love story 🌈
Trailer is better than the movie ...I saw this yesterday with my sister expecting a sister musical, but it was horrible. I'm a huge fan of musicals (fave is Hadestown) and everyone can sing really well and the visuals are nice, but the plot is all over the place. We almost walked out to watch Wish...thoroughly disappointed :/
Surely it should be a white actress playing Celie
The performance of the song “Push Da Button,” by Shug (Taraji P. Henson), wearing a shimmering red dress and a feathered headdress, arriving at the juke joint on a barge was breathtaking.
Why????
Halle is here.. I guess I won't watch it.. I was so excited 😢  Once she got w ddg something turned me off about her.. no hate I'm valid to an opinion
So glad I saw this clip! I won’t waste my time seeing it, I detest musicals. Love the theatre but hate musicals, so weird. 😅
Boosie sent me here! 😂 😂 😂 💀
Fantasia KILLED IT
Very stupid movie
I wonder if the new Color Purple will be just as subliminally esoteric and toxic feministic as the original?
You know it’s bs when no men are in the preview 😂
Carpet munching love story bashing black men with music.
Well damn What a movie. Good grief 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 What a talented group
The first is 100% better this is a bad copy
The movie was absolutely stunning. I cried!
Another remake. Hard pass.
I heard this movie is quite good, maybe Oprah Winfrey could send a copy of it to her good old buddy Harvey Weinstein in prison, I'm sure he would probably like it too
I did not like it.
Why a musical tho 😢
Another remake/adaptation of a musical based on a film , that was already a success, now that's milk it , and probably make it worse . The film industry is getting boring.
Saw this on Cmas Day, with my BFF of 40 yrs who I hadn't seen  in 13 yrs. We felt so much like the 2 sisters Nettie and Celie, seeing each other after more yrs than we'd been far apart! Loved the 1st version,  and felt this was an improvement in some ways of the original.  Very hard to top the originals' version of 'Sister ' and God's Trying to Tell You Something ' but there are other parts that surpassed the original. I'm so blessed to have seen both movies. Enjoyed the choreography more than I ever have since Mary Poppins 'Step in Time'!
Dying to know which one is best ....... ????
Have already seen it. Do another Alice Walker book to film, already.
Y tho? Watch the original movie. It's absolutely amazing.
Wow this joint seems 🔥🔥🔥🔥
😂.
Really we need another remake?? Hollywood is such a creative vacuum, remakes, sequels, prequels, parts 1,2,3,4, etc. I'll tell you why this film was made, ESG friendly, with little financial risk ticking all the woke boxes and stereotypes, it might be a decent film but please try harder Hollywood.
Another inclusive movie. That they can lie about being a block buster
Oprah, pay the ladies what they're worth!
i still like the book better.  What got me is when Celie lift Mister, she did go back and visit him time from time.  the more he actually got to know her, he for real asked her to marry him.  She declined.  The book is so much better but you got to be patient of the way it is written.
Smh I went and  watched this bs and fell asleep .
Man that fantasia………… ooh wee!! Beautiful
We Wuz Kangs!!! Oh SHieet
Fantasia's voice whew....
This movie sucked really bad
Looks like a talented cast. But I wish Hollywood would stop it with the remakes or adaptations or prequels or re-imagined movies no one asked for 🙄. Come up with some original ideas.
That girl got two flop under her belt hahahahhahahaha loser
Hahahaha flopppppppppp 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Unbelievable movie Color Purple. There is no comparison both movies were absolutely great but this was a different time and error for this color purple. Everybody in the movie was excellent if they don't get a nominated for an award!!! something is very wrong. The guy who picked this cast was a genius. Everybody picked in this movie was meant to be in this film. Absolutely. Excellent.!!! Not to mention the soundtrack, I'm getting the CD and the music praise the Lord thank you Jesus!!! I haven't been this excited about a picture watching at the theater in years.OMG Thank you. Color Purple cast!!!❤ go ahead Black Folk. African American.
Where are the white people? What happened to equality, diversity, and inclusion? Or does that only apply to the 14 percent that make up this country? AKA biggest Whiners, and Fit throwers.
Shocked and quite honestly appalled by the lack of diversity in this.
Who else saw this yesterday in bay plaza?😂
More propaganda 🐂💩👈🏾
I'm such a cry baby. Ugh, can't wait!
I absolutely love Fantasia! 😊❤
I bet that they are descendants of the queens that sold their own children and sisters and mothers to slavery
I'll pass on this one.
I love Taraji and all to other woman in this movie, BUT I WILL NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!  After what Oprah did to them, makes me sick..
Why do they have to make them uglier for these period movies.
Just knew this and i cried. Please let it air in indonesia!!
👁️                               👁️                   👃🏿                    👄
The colour purple = bruises
The colour purple 2023. It is a remake The colour purple 1985
As Much As I Was Disappointed To Hear Of A Remake,After Watching The Movie Trailer,I Might Give It A View!!!Jah God👌
Dam man, i thought it was a remake of thr original movie... i was hoping to see who would be acting out the iconic "All my life I had to fight" scene
Was taraji p complaining about a low pay in the purple color a promotion, i swear guys thats how i got to know about this moviem anyway nice movie
BLM trying to bank on a classic 🤣🤣🤣
This movie is awfully terrible and a waste of 3 hours of my life
Kevin Samuel’s… the color purpling of America. Want the black women to perpetuate the lie that they were treated harshly by the black man ….Satanic at its core
... Mr. Louis Gosset Jr.,  still the man.  Very talented actor, his name demands respect.   One of my favorites.  Checked the movie out today.
2:24 Why steven s. Is the movie producer on a black culture movie as if he know the pain/ stress our grand parents hadto endure. 🤔😡😡😡
Taraji P. THIS IS YOUR BLESSING REGARDLESS OF HOW THE TREATMENT OR THE PAY WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO YOUR WORK WORTH. GOD HAS A PLAN FOR YOUR LIFE NOT TO HARM YOU BUT TO BLESS YOU. YOU WILL RISE BECAUSE GOD IS WITH YOU. DONOT DISSPEAR BUT LEAN NOT TO YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING , BUT TRUST IN GOD. IT MAYNOT NOT COME TODAY OR TOMORROW BUT GOD'S TIME IS RIGHT ON TIME ! WAIT ON GOD BECAUSE NOONE CAN DO YOU LIKE THE BLESSING OF GOD.  TASTE AND SEE HOW SWEET HE IS ! I LOVE YOUR SPIRIT .
I saw the broadway production with Latoya London who was one of the 3 Divas along with Fantasia and Jennifer Hudson.  The musical was awesome and I can’t wait to see the movie adaptation!
Looking forward to the sequel in 2026 The Color Puce.
Does anyone know why most of the prime cast is played by black people? Why not have more diversity?
Is this movie about the space between halley berries eyes?
Merry Christmas America  !!!   $451 BILLION  a year to house and coddle invaders to OUR country.    TAXPAYING CITIZENS.... $451 BILLION,   a year.
Great to see Lady Whoopi (as midwife) in this remake of the Color Purple.  The 'musical' version on the silver screen highlights how empowering the soundtrack is, truly invigorating and energizing. Good, better and best are not rivals....just stations along the road of and to excellence. 5/5 stars.
does it rain in Africa?
fantasia & Taraji are about to win an academy award ❤❤❤
This was much better than the first one. Fantasia was very good, singing moving. Taraji Hensen carried the move, hope she receives acknowledgment. This place focused more on our heritage.
Just gives me chills, Love the trailer
I just saw the movie Taraji Did Her Thing, she continues to show her versatility.
Fantasia
Dark skin is beautiful! I hate how everybody always treats dark skin as if it’s ugly, even black people do it.
Now this is how you cut a trailer.
Saw this movie today. Didn’t even know Fantasia could act. This was a phenomenal take/musical. They did an outstanding job. I loved it so much.
Just bc its adaptation of the Broadway show doesn't mean it should be subpar. I love musicals and it didnt live up to all the hype.
I am not a fan of the musical at all! I went and supported the cast but would not recommend the movie 🍿. The ladies might like it but the husbands were having a snoring contest in the movie theater. My Honest review!
Nope
They should have done another color and left The Color Purple alone. Ijs
Wow some of Jeffrey Epstein friends made this! Oprah, where is the diversity!!!!!
💜
Halle Baileys voice?! Nope! She sounds ridiculous which tells me this movie sucks.
I remember the first movie growing up not gonna lie this looks actually pretty good too
Why did they feel the need to remake this garbage?
Loved the new movie but the music was so lackluster. No big glorious music.
JUST GOT DONE WATCHING IT TONIGHT!!!   Baby it was good!! The dancing and songs was A1
😊
This movie was amazing , it brought tears to my eyes !!! Lovely performance!
I just watched the Color Purple and it was AMAZING!!! 🎉❤❤🎉❤ The cast killed it! Congratulations everyone
A new take on the classics that’s a remake😂
I just got home from watching this movie. Amazing, and I can't wait to see it again. Nice to see Fantasia in this. Always loved her singing.
I saw this movie today, Christmas Day. It is a fantastic movie, and i recommend seeing it.
It was TRASH!
The opening to the trailer is, We wuz kangz... LMFAO!!!
Never saw the frist one wasn't sure if I was going to like it it was very enjoyable I was told that over 2 k people seen it so far I saw the 3 rd showing I was in a theater 🎥 of 65 there were 40 to 50 people there lots of singing  no spoiler but if you go the screen at the end were there singing or earlier look at the little kid when she hugs him he looks at her like he dint want to be touched the singing scene the kid  the little boy is looking all over the place instead of singing like the others are like he was spopusted to have been doing........ I give it 13 out of 13 skulls 💀 ☠️ must see
Good movie I even cried a few times.
Tear Jerker.. great music.. great cast.. And a whole Lotta Amen.. it made me cry 😢.. the harmonies at the end was emotional and I see you taraji 👋👏👏👏
It was released on Christmas Day
Just saw the movie today and it was amazing! Yes, it’s based on the musical but it’s sooo good and the singing was outstanding!
The movie was actually good
Coour  puppurl
2023 color purple movie siter hood
This movie is going to make black women even more single, just like Oprah.
Every time I hear about a new take on legendary movies, I know it's gonna be trash. With all of today's bs
What the original wasnt black enough
NOBODY CARE ABOUT THE SAME OLD SAD STORY ITS 2023 YOU BLACK PRODUCERS CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER STORYLINE "you ppl want us stuck in the MASSA era" DAMN SHAME 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Extraordinary 👏
If this movies doesn't have the scene where Shug burst into the church singing then this ain't the color purple!
Anyhow anti male film
So is this more a musical ?
Who in going to pack into theatres on CHRISTMAS DAY to see a slave flick?
The movie looks like trash
I can’t wait to have a good laugh at this one on Monday.
This is a BM bashing movie... straight trash garbage
Looks like it sux
I read the color purple. This is not the book, the book has a profound soul of one humans life experience from lost, endurance and finally. It can't be described. You should read the book. Make her story live once more.
Fantasia's vocals just gives me, the chills. What a very anointing voice, she has. && they have all the best actors and actresses, in this movie. I'm so excited and I can't wait to see it!!
Didn't need a remake at all.
I  never liked the color purple.  It is a very demeaning, degrading, and abusive movie and we get that here now why would I want to go backward.  It takes too long to reveal the overcoming.
My gf wanna go see this and I’m NOT looking forward to it
This is all Oprah Winfrey can make is slave, the butler, the maid she cannot make a movie that empowers Black people I do not want to see another slave or the butler not I don’t wanna see this movie
I am a huge fan of the classic and seeing FANTASIA taking the lead role makes me want to see this movie even more!!!  I AM EXCITED!!
We wuz kangz!
I cannot wait. The Color Purple is my favorite movie of all times!
Oprah is a snake don’t go see this movie. She again will use black people as she laughs her way to the bank after she pays them Pennies. Boycott this movie black folk
It's sad that Whoopi goldberg didn't return on the color purple reboot movie
This movie is going to blow up in 2024 I’m telling y’all
So sad
I know everyone excited for fantasia and trust me I damn sure am too , but I am so excited for ms Danielle brooks as well I’ve been waiting for her big breakout role since her Netflix series “orange is the new black “  & so glad that taraji will get to showcase more of her talented . singing as well growing up my grandmother was obsessed with the color purple and I didn’t understand why so the movie would irritate me so much lol because it was played every day but I haven’t seen it in forever I just remember being a kid and it was hard to watch the mistreatment of celie but I had to go rewatch it before going to see the musical and as an adult I appreciate it more and I’m so excited ❤ can’t wait to go support and see this with my family 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Another great attempt to push the message of the worthlessness of a black man.
Not another “slave “ movie
Taraj was NOT the best pick to play shug
💌
Mister played by Michael Fassbender.
It’s a musical 😡
It might be a remake but oprah still on a quest to make black men look like monsters.
I don't know if I'm ready for this
We wuz kangz n shiet
A derivative 'Dream Girls' w/ Fantasia subbing 4 Jennifer!! It WON'T work a 2nd time!!! 👎💣🤮!!!
A holiday 'BOMB'!!! Old, tired #BLM forgettable drivel 🤮💣 Who cares, much LESS has ANY interest?!!... Oscar bait & then shoved in2 streaming purgatory!! 🐷👎🔥😈🔥🐖👎!!! Easily ignored & 4gotten!!!  Where's Tyrese & Dwayne 'The Rock'?!! 😜🤮💣💣🤮😩💣🐷💣👎💣!!!
Seems really interesting, I haven’t heard of this book before since I’m not from the US. Definitely going to watch this version💜
The first one had me bawling. This one is going to be epic!
Fantasia should have played Suge.. she can sang and she's beautiful...I hope no more Color Purples...
Raven Goodwin should have been Sophia..
Fantasia touch the heavens with her voice.
MORE SLAVE MOVIES.....Y WOULD I GO SEE THIS!
Must see
Love fantasia one beautiful woman and soul. Never liked the original color purple. Due to the savage way FBA  were depicted and abusive to the sistas. It was ment to divide the black communities worldwide. Not a fan of Harpo, either . There are many enemies amongst us and an agenda to destroy FBA .  Shout-out Mrs fantasia wishing you all the success you are working so hard for... B1 FBA United...
🚸ANTIRAPE🪳MAFIA🚸
This takes the charm out of the original ..... not gonna waste time and watch it
I wanna see this movie just to hear Fantasias beautiful voice❤
My LAWD 😭😭😭😭 I just cried so hard!!! The Color Purple is one of my most Favorite movies and just watching this trailer I've been crying like a newborn baby..... That movie moves me, and I'm actually scared to see this one because I don't want to compare it to the first one because I know it's not a remake, I know definitely can't go to a theater because I get too into movies and shows so I'll have to wait but it definitely looks like I will have something to wait for!❤️
Disgraceful
The question is...  WHY? Trying to replace Danny Glover, Whoopy and even Oprah herself, besides stupid, for me, is disrespectful. Has Hollywood lost the creativity.... sounds like
This makes me miss my sister Pavi she loved this movie
*I DONT CARE THAT IT IS AN ADAPTATION! THIS MOVIE IS SACRED AND SHOULDNT BE MESSED WITH IN ANY WAY! NOT EVEN A “ADAPTATION”!!*
I love the original movie and read the book the book was 100xs better then the movie I was hoping this movie could do the book justice but hearing this is a musical movie Is disappointing
I felt goosebumps just watching the trailer alone. I'm excited to see this movie 🎬. Can't wait 😊
Song ?
It look like they going to be doing more singing than acting
If you've seen the first one you've seen them all -  and all times for it to come out on a CHRISTMAS DAY!!!
😭😭😭
Just wanna know if they remade the "Speak To Me" scene with Suge Avery busting through the church doors...One of my favorite scenes from any movie...ever
❤❤❤❤
I can't wait till I see my favorite movie
Just what we need: an updated opportunity to portray black men to black women as monsters. What are they going to do ten years from now? Make the "Color Purple in space"?
Taraji is Shug Avery? Damn that role is perfect for her.
Fukn do Mansa Musa! This is crazy in 2023! Do the Moors! Geez.
The more I watch this trailer the more excited I get for this movie.  I know my grandma would have loved this movie . May she rest in peace. But seriously I cannot wait
So a movie based on a musical based on a movie based on a book.
Are they gonna change any of the characters to white people?
This already looks lame..
Another remake 😭…. All the original content creators must be 💀 😮‍💨😭😭
So the black men sing while graping?
Oh lawd, here we go again fellahs.
Wow I am in tears. This movie is one of my favorites. I’m just just speechless. Amazing
Fantasia is gonna tear this ish UP!!
Cant beat the original
I have goosebumps allover my body and tears in my eyes! ❤
The original holds such a special place in my heart. But I can't deny this looks amazing.
Really🤔
I will research everyone involved in this production. If any preached about inclusivity in the past, I will never watch this.
The movie was profound and heart moving and Sisterhood at its highest. Black excellence in the cast members!  Attended a screening of the movie in Ontario CA.❤❤❤
I can't even tell you how many times I have watched the orginal movie!! Can't wait to see this one.
I bought my tickets and my bestie and I are going to see it Christmas day and I can't wait!!
I need to see this to open my heart again to the unheard victims of society.
Took my daughters to see it today and it was great! The people in the theater literally clapped at the end.
Is this suppose to be the remake of the original color purple?..cause if so I'm lost cause this looks totally different from the original color purple
WHG YALL KEEP MAKING AFRICAN ANERICAN MOVIES … BUT ANYWAY MAKE SOME TRUE AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY EVENT MOVIES ATLEAST IF YALL ARE GONNA KEEP MAKING BLACK OEOPLE MOVIES 😂
🥶🥶🥶woooo this trailer gave me GOOSEBUMPS.SOOO GOOD.I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT,GOOD LORD ITS GONA SELL OUT
If you going to do color purple please do it like the original all that fancy stuff take away the original, understanding and the belief of what the original movie gave us for what our ancestors fault for so if it's not being done right don't do it at all I feel like it's a degrace and I know I'm not the only one feel this way I have no problem with the actors and I'm proud of what they did but if you not gonna do it right don't do it at all if anyone have a comment then speak up before you speak up watch the movie and then comment
No offense to the offended But I like the original one the best..
I thought I was gonna get a light skin version this time around 😂
Looks like a good movie but I’m Not going to support anything that Oprah is involved in. She’s a nasty women.
Fantasia’s voice is just impeccable
I can't wait.
You can never give a negative comment without being hated on. The fan favorite dickriders will always think you have to say something positive or nothing at all because it bothers them
Woahhh so hype for this one. Thank you Spielberg you r my favorite.
I am so excited to see this
I just love hearing Fantasia sing her voice just put me in a whole different type of happiness,, Fantasia and Taraj their connection is just magical I can't wait to see the full movie,,, 😊😊😊😊
I enjoyed the original movie but this isn't going to work out well with the black American community unless your 25 and younger. Kinda like the younger generation are making fun of their ancestors.
So Oprah screwed whoopi again huh.... Whoopi made the color purple what is was.....Oprah need to give whoopi are flowers....
No white people in this movie; this is not racism is reparation and racial justice.
Fantasia is nominated for a Golden Globe 🙌
"That aint Fantasia "
Where is the white people? O yeah, i get it!!
I can’t wait ❤❤❤❤
Can’t wait to watch this movie
Not even knowing about this new movie, I just rewatched the original last night.  While I detest remakes of great films and not a huge fan of Fantasia, I am willing to watch with an open mind /heart because it’s based on the musical.
I just came for the Adowa 😊
The original movie was the worst representation of black men and our Sistas experience everything spiritually so beware of what the women in your family consume because the black marriage has went down hill since the original movie
This is sooo wrong.  Don't mess with perfection.
One more reason not to go to the movies = Hawaii !
2 hours of mangling the English language... You just know this movie is going to be jammed down our throats in every possible way
I can't wait to not watch this!!! 😂😂
100% garbage and more. Like we needed a remake of that 80's POS movie "The Color Purple."
This gonna be stupid. Especially since they made it a musical.
Not very diverse guys L
The original Color Purple is my favorite movie of all time. I also saw it on Broadway with Fantasia Barrino and loved that version. I will see this one as well.
It says a bold new take on the original classic, so yea this is not completely separate from the original, it’s a newer version (just for the ppl saying otherwise)   It could never replace the original, I’ve watched it maybe 22 times, lol no exaggeration! But I will still give this one a try ❤️❤️❤️ only because I enjoy the story line
Going to flop. From the director of the West Side Story remake and starring the lead from The Little Mermaid remake.
Where is the DIVERSITY they cry for in other movies? Exactly, prejudice racest!
❤
I love all the beautiful actresses and actors ❤in this movie! What is the purpose of this dam show? We were finish with this pain in 1985 with the Original 🤨so why keep reminding black women of this pain all over again in dam near 2024? smh I am over it all!smdh! I am not amused one bit but more hurt than anything… this country will never change for the better EVER… just take ya hands off now Yahweh!!!! God! Let GOD do what he may! I’m done praying for a country like this…..have your way YAHWEH! I’m a veteran of the  Armed Forces 🇺🇸🦅 and I have EARNED THE RIGHT to feel how I want in this ungrateful country…I don’t care who don’t like it! Leave this pain in 1985 because I’m on to the ignorance! Get them God!!! It is about to be 2024 not 1985 stop going backwards! I wish I could meet Kamala Harris  THE VPOTUS Of  The United States Period! 🇺🇸🦅
Ugh I don't like the casting choices.  Fantasia and Halle Bailey look absolutely nothing a like to be believable as even half sisters. They should of cast younger actresses for the roles of Avery and Celie.
We r not Africans we r ABOriginees of America look up Muhammad Ali Malcolm X n many more talking about it 😊
I will watch when they stop referring to Africa as a country talking about “ let me tell you about this place called Africa” like WTH
Fantasia- I… don’t…  Me- 😭 😭 😭 LET ME HAVE IT, TASIA!!!
Color purple is one of my favorite movie, and im excited for this. Greeting from México.❤
Fantasia,Taraji, and the lady the played Opra's part did their thing ❤
Dogshit
Why arent there all white ppl in this movie? I thght everything getting remade was suppose to b race swapped? This is an outrage!
I can feel the power through the trailer ❤
They should have made them white...
2 minute trailer and I’m sobbing
Omg I can't wait til this comes out.
fantasiaa is backk!!!!
One thing you count on is taxes, death and anti-black male propaganda.
OMG why am i tearing up. So touching😭😭. Haven’t been to a movie in years, this film might do it. If this film doesn’t get an Oscar I don't know any other competition  that will match up.
If Oprah is involved, in any way, I won't watch it.
Fantasia’s voice is anointed
Shout out to my HBCU for getting a special screening for us tomorrow! So excited to be one of the lucky few watching before Christmas Day
I saw a screening of the movie, it’s amazing. I loved it so much. The movie is so beautifully written and it made my cry multiple times. The crew is so talented and they are just amazing actors.
A friend and I stayed in the movie theater after the movie ended and watched it a second time. One of my favorite movies.  But the book is better
I wonder if this movie is going to portray Celie and Shug relationship as in the book. They had a full on relationship.
Off the topic. But I really wish they would remake Sydney Poitier and Harry Bellafonte  classic Buck and the Preacher. I think Jamie Foxx and Samuel Jackson would really pull it off.🎥🎬
Where's Ciara?
WTF is this
I can't wait to see it!!
This film is sooo sad man I wish the original wasn’t made I got a lil sister 😢
Fantasia!!!
Nah. Just nah.
The original emotionally affected me… Don’t nobody wanna see no musical
I cant wait to see this
I cant wait to see it now❤❤❤❤ come 12/25/2023
Our people are ruined….
Mr. Still around ladies…feminists still win!
WHY IS THERE NO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN THIS FILM? THIS IS NOT OK.
I know a box office flop when I see one.  Edit: this comment aged well.
I can’t wait
Black Gender War finna intensify next year 2024  GenZ and I see it  Gen Alpha and Gen Beta, good luck 💕   All and all look like it going to be a fantastic movie
Oh this is going to be so beautiful.  Let me start looking for my purple attire
You have to create a myth for people with permanent PTSD otherwise they will become worthless. They will give up unless you lie to them.
Y’all are easily impressed
Wow Beautiful cast Beautiful story I want to see it already...  I'm there
Ok ok can I be honest?. Great idea great movie just all around great memories and great stuff. Tear drop. But do we really need another one.?
Love it!
I honestly don’t know if I can handle this 😢
Wondering if they are gonna stay true to the original story line and the male characters. I only see Mista but were Harpo... They helped to make the story line ..  Can't wait to see this one...
I've always felt Uncle Tom's Cabin, The Color Purple and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings were some sort of trilogy
I tought it was fnaf movie new or something
This is my favorite movie it looks really good, but it will never come close to the original one.
This made me tear up
Why didn’t they make the actors white?? Would’ve been better.
Ya kaangs & kweens 😂😂
A Bold new take? What's this supposed to mean? God, I hope they don't destroy another classic.
This looks good
Is this a remake for the Gen Z?
I'll pass on the mammy BS remake. The first one was terrible and typical degrading slave, male attacking mammy nonsense.
Y’all know damn well this gonna be trash! A bunch of rookie actresses playing this deep of a movie.
I wish hollywierd would leave classics alone.....such a beautiful story, nothing new save for new faces can improve upon it.
I’m pushing back tears just watching the trailer. I can’t wait to see Fantasia in this😭
Why is Hollywood so against MARKETING movie musicals AS movie musicals?!
So it’s more on the musical side, I’ll wait until it’s on tv
Watched the screening last night and my heart was so full! I can't wait to see it again! Fantasia was beyond phenomenal! And Halle was so amazing in it!
It’s good movie love it
This is some b.s. and will be the final nail in the coffin for black men and women ever coming together. Once again Oprah’s evil quest to destroy the black man’s image is in play.
We wuz kangz!
A flop in the making, and will I will personally contribute to it. By not spending my coins to see it. You can't remake perfection. Period! 👎
AMERICA LOVES GLORIFYING THE ENSLAVEMENT OF THE BKACK RACE  FYI THERE WERE SLAVES OF ALL RACES NOT JUST AFRICANS  GLORIFY THE RACE NOT JUST THE ENSLAVEMENT
So, to be simple this is just the Broadway musical play turned into a movie version? Just trying to understand. 😊
I didnt care about this but wow I love Fantasia because she was a popular singer im my high school days. Give her an Oscar and Grammy now!
This seems a rather unnecessary production, the original film was just spectacular
omg what a cast!!!!!!!! i can not WAIT!!!! ima cry so muchhh
I love to see it, #BUT they will NOT open movie theaters on #Christmas day over here in #NC ,specifically Fayetteville 😢
I have never even heard of this franchise but the trailer made me tear up- I feel such a connection with this…
Feels like Joe biden is behind this
As soon as I hear Fantasia singing, I start to cry. I just love her so much.
I will be seeing this approximately 100x.
Propaganda!!!
They shouldve left this movie alone ..straight trash
No thanks sticking to the original which is gold
This movie means a great deal to the Black community.
Why?  Why?  This musical is not relevant, and why present this during the holiday season.  Just continue to remind us of our ugliness, when we have nothing but images of how ugly we are everyday.  Just what we deserve during a holiday season... can't there ever be love and beauty of black woman.  You show us men that abuse us for the holiday.  Thanks a lot!
Why didn't they cast more white actors!? Oh, I forgot: that would be ridiculous, right?
Is it for one day only showing?
Thats all black people want to do,dance,sing in church and hire all the black females who are involved one way or another with their....what?...as he puts it..."Big White Man".
A harrowing story about sexual abuse in childhood is not exactly the kinda story I would choose to have a big sing-a-long with.   I’m not doubting the quality of the musical numbers or the performers, I’m sure they’re great but I just don’t know if I can enjoy it in this story’s context.  It’s like if you made a musical about the boys who were abused by figures of the Catholic Church. I can’t really groove to a song about that.
I remember waiting in line 3 hours at The Galleria in Houston to see the original in 1985. It was worth the wait. Hope the musical is great as well.
I'm looking forward too this I saw the stage show this year and it was incredible so if that's anything to go by this will be outstanding
another woke movie
CIA  going Plat for the next gen of tear down of the black male image
if it's a musical ...
Well, let me say this, I was against it at first and thought why the heck can people not use their i,agination and come up with ssomething new. They keep re-making stu, BUT i would like to take back my opinion, i am looking forard to someone other than whoopie showing off some reeal acting chops and let me just say TPH, she got it going on. Love her so much bought her hair stuff. Now I want to see some realy emotion, everyone else had it but whoopie cannot show much other than aggression
Looking at this I can immediately tell it will be better then Cats.
Boo
I am thrilled to see this Broadway adaptation with Fantasia and Halle.
Yay! More white hatred! Let's keep the racism going!
Nah this ain’t it at all
I saw this on broadway in 2004 with the original cast and all I remember is standing up and clapping and crying for miss ceelie bc she made it!!!
For God sake! THIS is the kind of movie that everyone wants! ❤😢 ...goosebumps! 😵
Halle is too light skinned I demand a recast
Looks good. I hope it delivers. The cast looks strong.
WE WUZ KANGZ
‪That church scene from the original at the end had me crying like a baby‬
Omg I hope they didn’t ruin this classic movie I still believe the original is one of the best movies ever it makes me cry
I remember my american teacher showing this to our class as part of the lesson and upcoming test. Passed the time bawling my eyes out and once this trailer came out I immediately recognized the original movie
Can’t wait!! Fantasia voice 💕
Remember Halle Bailey who plays Ariel in the Little Mermaid?
Oh great! Another movie vilifying black men
A film for racists, not a single white actor, The heroine's brother or sister is not white-skinned.
The original movie is a masterpiece, but I have a big feeling this musical version won’t meet our expectations. I’m worried about Halle playing her role too.
I could watch the original everday, I absolutely love that movie.  I'm crying as I watch this trailer....I'm going to have to see this.
I hope its as good as the original film!
The cast  The cast  The cast!!!! Im so exited❤
i'll stick to the original 1985 movie thank you.
Instead of jamming theatres to see this, blacks should be knocking the doors down of the “reps” that have kept them oppressed for decades.  Inner-city ghettos = modern plantations.  Wake up.
BOYCOT THIS FILM! BLACK PEOPLE WAKE-UP! THIS FILM DID IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO YOUR ETHNIC IMAGE! FIGHT BACK!
Release it ASAP. I have my semester exam soon... It'll help me...
The original movie-----wrecks me every time! I can barely get through it without going in such the 'ugly' cry. I'll have to see this one too. 🤗
I can’t wait to see this 😊
As a Black U.S. citizen with an ancestry going back over 400 years to slavery in South Carolina, I am so sick of these times of movies/series dealing with slavery, Jim Crow, and seeing Blacks portrayed as second class citizens in their country during these depressing times in the South. As a 68 year old Black man, I refuse to live in the past.
Good Lord, I cried like a baby, imagine me when I see the movie in it's entirety lol, wow, I'm so excited to see this!
Danielle Brooks!!!
big box office
We needed this, its time to heal the world
man get the tissues im finna boo hoo😢
Not this movie too 😢 some classics should be left alone.
What does this mean... Reimagining? What have they changed? They are showing the parts we are familiar with, but keep saying it's reimagined...
I am okay with most cast , but that crooked eyes mermaid?  Gimme a break. I don’t remember a mentally handicapped role in the color purple. Couldn’t they find a better and prettier actress for that. Pfft
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
💎💎💎💎💎
💜💜💜💜💜
Is the new movie a musical?
I CANNOT WAIT!!!!
OOH CANNOT WAIT
Booooooooo
I cannot wait for this❤
Halle went from Ariel to Addie the doll from American girl and  i live it😂❤
i cry every time i watch this trailer
I just caught chills ❤❤❤❤
I can not wait
Whew I get chills and wanna cry every time I see this.
I can't F*ckin wait for this 😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
I just watched the original one for the 9,000,000th time. And once again the ending made me cry 🙄 smh now my mascara is ruined😢
Look at the old movie don't need a new version showing blacks in a negative light why always. Spielberg put this out years ago Jew couldn't he bring out a black movie with blacks doing positive things. Keep showing black men in a negative way their are black men doing positive things and treat black women like queens and are loving to their children. I guess they will be making a updated version of driving Ms. Daisy now that's a positive movie I think not.🤨
Is this a musical
They found a good young actress to match up with how Fantasia looks
Ooh here we go, OORAH TRYING TO GET SYMPATHY FOR MORE MONEY!!!  GAG ME W BORING DOM!!!   1st time was good enoughfst!!!
Does a black character appears in a trailer about African history? Woke!
Whooo!
I cannot wait for this!!!!
So we made a movie based on a book and then a broadway musical and now a movie based on the broadway musical and then did almost the same with mean girls. Ok.
lets mess up another classic smh they love to destroy greatness
This all hits differently when you read the novel.
If it’s a musical they’ve fucced up the movie. Punk mfz
I guarantee you it’s going to be a bunch of slicc anti blk male, blk feminist, blk women are all we got rhetoric in it like the first one! I’ll pass! 🗑️✌🏼
Trash and Nettie was dark skinned!!!
CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS ITS GONNA BE PACKED AT THEM THEATERS ON CHRISTMAS 💯😂🫶🏽
taraji, halle, danielle and HER!!!!! H.E.R. is my favorite female artist 😩🤤
Nog the theaters about to be PACKED Christmas day. Belly's full family time❤
Looks like a great movie to fall asleep to.
I am SOBBING 😭 I am so excited for this release 🫶🏼 The original is my all time favorite 🥹
this book I treasured the movie was a blessing and now am waiting for history to be made in this brilliant musical... God bless you all for this   Laurie Marchello Peck
Awesome 🤩 Song?
Hollyweird make sure they give these slave type movies every year to keep Melinated people programmed to this frequency. Lol Fk outta here with this BS !! WE'VE SEEN IT BEFORE!
Garbage!
💯 Black movies are almost always only about 2 things. I wish we got better films. It’s either slaves, drugs or Tyler Perry’s.   We need more black films and shows like The Creator, Atlanta ect ect, where we act normal.
This movie has talent
🔥 🖤 🎉❤
Looks Good. ❤
I can’t wait
Y’all messed da original up with this
I look so forward to see what Miss Oprah has done!
The original was a powerful and beautiful if not brutal movie, that I still remember to this day. I hope this movie does it justice 🧡
I want to see what Ciara looks like as Nettie!!!!
More of the same ABUSIVE AND WIMPY, EMASCULATED MEN back in '85???  I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!  BOYCOTT IT!!!!
Movie musical both make me cry always and this is gonna make cry and cry and cry my mama showed me this film and I loved it since 💜
Ugh god
Tarea 11
SOOOO CANNOT WAIT----I couldn't ask for anything more this Christmas <33
Halle and Fantasia , amamos vcs daqui do Brasil 🇧🇷 ❤
❤ all the trailers amazing I cant wait.  Christmas 🎄 is too far away
😢😢😢😢❤❤❤
Oh yeah 👍🏾
Not interested!
why do a remake for? it's not needed
Fishface 🤢🟤
The whole cast lineup is amazing, but tbh I'm mainly excited to hear Fantasia sing again. I got emotional just hearing her sing in this trailer.
this looks so amazing !!! so excited to see Danielle Brooks !!!!
1:43 *Yesssssssssss.* Sang baby.
Oh my goodness the trailer itself has me emotional. The original Color Purple movie is one of my favorite all time movies. I remember the 1st time I watched it at the age of 13 yrs old in 1998 I was at awe. I was 3 yrs old when the original movie came out.  I would make my PaPa sit and watch the original movie over and over again with me. I could tell he would get irritated with me. Lol! That is one of the great memories that I will always cherish that I had with my grandfather. So seeing that it comes out on Christmas my favorite and true holiday, I am going to be a emotional wreck sitting there in the movie theatre Christmas day God willing, just happy and crying tears of joy. Blessings, love, and hugs everyone. Be safe. 💜
Lack of diversity in the cast. Its 2023 we can do better.
Here we go again...  another woke trash movie
Oprah put a lot of people on in this movie
I want to read the book again ❤️
I love the actors in it I'm not a fan of the producer so I pass on this
nothing can replace the original film. thinking of different parts of it could make me cry on the spot. i watch that movie and bawlllll and bawlllll damn i love that movie
Thanks I was about to go off about this classic
Fantasia was so amazing on Broadway it’s only right she gets the movie part
Taraji P Henson as Shug Avery? Could that casting be more perfect? This whole thing looks amazing!  Never got a chance to see the musical on stage so this will have to do.
This looks good omg!! Going see it
Boooooooo… Why didn’t they make the main character a white redhead man? Aren’t we in the age of raceswapping and gender bending? This isn’t brave or bold… 🤪😵‍💫🤣
I refuse to watch this because oprah supports it 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
This opens doors for everyone but Haley and Fantasia they really going to get notice in this movie because they Haley is a new up coming singer to the public eye and mover star and Fantasia is a new up coming movie star she's already known for her music she done a movie before but that was about her life im in love already about this movie because of everybody they have playing in it they are all great stars
You sitting at the head of your own dinner table and you acting like a waiter 😂
Not a white persons in sight ❤❤❤
So Hollywood finally ran out of rip-off ideas by remaking movies that were good enough on their own, that they are now remaking crappy movies??? Cant anybody there come up with an original idea?
Cant wait❤❤
It's great to see the creature from Splice finally having a new serious starring role
Omg AMC. Just take all of my money
I cry just by watching the trailer. I love halle.
I HATE REMAKES! NOTHING COMPARES TO THE FIRST ONE
I AM GONNA LOVE THIS MOVIE I ALR LOVE THE ORIGINAL LOL
Tomorrow y'all ready I am ❤
🎉❤ Looks like a good movie. I am definitely going to watch.❤
I love this movie The Original! it gets a bad reaction because people focus in negativity, everything   sums up when everyone stopped what they were doing and headed to church.. and I don't go to church, I don't remember when was the last time I went to church, but my Father was a pastor too.. that's the main reason I relate to this drama so much.. because when you have planted in you spirituality even when you're far from it, you Know you can turn your life around, what makes us happy when is all done and said is not the physical is within , and in this trailer I see they make the women more rivilient , is delusional when we take it to the time the drama supposed to take place, because all women were different regardless of  spirituality and religious beliefs.. the only thing looks great to me is the new technology , the camara,  and great customs, there's no way I will care to watch this version as much I have done the original, Besides when there was less technology the Art of Acting was a lot better!
I can WAIT! 😊
Realize it was based off the musical, i was like ok realize both Spielberg and Oprah are involved i got no worries
Cookie plays Suge! Holy S#!T I can't wait to see this! One of my favourite movies of all time and Oprah at her best and Danielle!
This soundtrack will be amazing!! 🤩
I will be front and center on Christmas at the movie theater
If it has to do with anything with Oprah who cares?
😭😭😭😭
Just what we need another division movie 🤦🏽‍♂️ I’m so done with the black community😒.
they should invite white actors doing this movie lol
I already have tears in my eyes I could not be more excited about this movie SO AWESOME! I love this movie so much from the actresses in the original and the music in the movie 100% amazing!! One my favorite movies and I have got to say The actors and actresses that got the parts in this movie had to be The dream role to play Congrats to them! Totally amazing! I was wondering if they would remake this movie I hope it is as good as the original Color purple!!!
Cultural Marxist propaganda
Whew fantasia .. that lady know she can sing
OMG! What a magnificent voice and wonderful!, I'm a devoted fan of the first film, and I know that this production is going to be as memorable as the first. 💜💜💜  ￼
Because theyll get it right this time? Hollywood strike should of lasted forever. They have no more original ideas. Just remaking every classic movie. Youll never beat the original.
I’m here for it.
There was no need to redo this movie. The original was done perfectly
WOW WOW WOW! can’t wait
I'm just going to say it... Why do we need a remake of this? Why do movies focusing on African-American culture always have to involve slavery, drug dealers, or men in dresses? This story isn't even relevant to where we are and where we need to go as a whole. Where are the films focusing on inventors, explorers, trendsetters, and drivers of movements and revolutions? I'm personally over the slave and old-school poverty films that seem to only help grow the victim mentality that so many of our people have developed. Hope people have the same energy for the Bob Marley: One Love film coming to theaters.
Gotta be honest I like the original movie with Whoopi Goldberg better. I don’t see the need to remake things when they were good the first time not trying to hate, but could’ve done something else
Oh, another Oscar bait film
No no no
Noooooooookooooooo
I might watch it… 🙄
Just the trailer gives me CHILLS. CAN'T WAIT👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This is a disaster only ruins Steven speilberg classic
Poison for a new generation. Just like the last color purple was.  Hated. To separate people from each other.  All of Oprah's family call her a lier, a user, and a spoiled brat.  This is an Anti-Black man movie, there isn't 1 good black man character.
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Whoopi passed the torch to fantasia i can't wait to see this
I’m just going to miss the original songs
Okay Oprah help Maui , with the revenue you receive from this film . Big time producer money !
I am sure that there will be good acting and I have high expectations of Fantasia and know that she will knock it out of the park.  It's time for a new direction on how Black people will compete in more recent time.  Show us building roads, bridges, skyscrapers.  Show how we create the next generation of technology products.  These movies of this type have been done many times.  Let's do something that Show how we will build that brighter future.
people are jealous because she have talent and she’s black and if  she was any other color they would not say the stuff that they are saying
Oh my God, I cannot wait to watch this!!
Black people 🤦🏻‍♂️
I’m wanna see it but I won’t I need to see the Renaissance era why don’t we ever make French and African movies about it why I’m thankful for Langston Hughes thank you og for unlocking my mind poets. That’s what made me believe we are more then song and dance this is cool but not interested
Do we really need another color purple? The original was a classic
The trailer (in tall purple letters) calls this is "a bold new take on the beloved classic," but implies the beloved classic is the 1985 Spielberg film, not the Walker novel. The film was popular but got mixed reactions; Spike Lee denounced it. I suspect Spielberg is still smarting from the critical drubbing he got & is trying to have the last word.
1:48 sang baby!
I hope it's closer to the book
Looks good
An adaptation of a film that portrayed all men as abusers and deviants.
We are the center of the universe.❤
I’m applauding everyone in this movie. I am so glad that this movie is coming out and I will be in the front seat. Congratulations to all of the cast.❤
I'm so excited to see this ❤ I love the original movie so much 💖 can't Waite  to see it
I wish they would’ve given young, hungry, talented actos that we don’t know a chance. I’m tired of seeing the same folks casts in EVERYTHING🤦🏾‍♀️
one of my favorite broadways and based on the trailer it looks like they will be able to give it justice. Excited for this one to hit the theatre.
Loool stumbled on this by mistake and I'm definitely watching😭😭🤌
It will win at least one Oscar. Because, it has to.
Well I know what I’m doing on Christmas Day ❤
The fact black people go see movies like this only to remind you that you was once a slave makes me laugh but the so called black producers don't wanna make movie about he Gullah wars or Shaka Zulu showing us in a powerful image that tells true history not some sing along only to show the black man raping his daughter cause that's the main reason the movie is even known I can only call this menticide to the black state of mind. Sad not many of us left
Halle and her damn eyes 👁    👃🏽    👁
Who came here to watch this novel for their exam preparation 😂 like me 🙋‍♂️😂
Anyone know of this song at the start ?  Made my heart flutter
Love the gift of Fantasia's voice...
Wheres hoppo lol
I LOVE THIS MOVIE...   ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I can’t wait. I saw the one with Whoppi Goldberg and Oprah.
I am going to see this movie. But some  classic need to be just left alone. And I think this is one of them. But I'm going to see the movie.
I can’t wait for this!!!
Alice Walker's Color Purple did incalculable damage to black people. The book and subsequent movies are the worst depictions of black men ever. Alice Walker did more damage to black people than any other depiction of black people in literary, cinematic or any other artistic form. Alice Walker's daughter Rebecca Walker was spot on  and talking about much more than just their relationship when she penned her article: "How my mother's fanatical views tore us apart."
I'm not playing with you, Oprah, behind this movie. If it's not good, I'm going to write a stern letter to your studios if it's not good. You will rue the day you came after my all time favorite movie.
Got my fingers crossed for a Whoopi cameo.
❤️😔
Oh my it’s gonna be a beautiful Christmas .. thanks for sharing ❤
Idk about this well maybe this is for this generation to see it in a different version I’ll just let my daughter watch tha original
I'm seeing it advertised as it's only playing for 1day and that's on Christmas day
Dont remind me of the original..I'm good on this one
Please don't be a musical and live up to the older one and be better than the original 😅🫰
He doesn't understand the public.
No
I am sor=y si Oprah
I thought this was a remake of "The Sugarland Express", but I saw this trailer earlier today before "A Haunting in Venice", and it looks great!
More racial garbage slop!
I made a mistake watching the original at 12 years old. I could not sleep for a while
Sad to see them crush a classic film.
Another flop on the way
As someone living in the birthplace of Fantasia, I teared up when I saw this preview before the Barbie movie.  I am SO proud of her!
Another film to make black men look bad and to pit BW against us...this does NOT represent our culture
Pple soo kno gd already
I can't wait not to see this garbage.  Don't we have enough issues in the black community already than to have another Color Purple movie released.
Fantasia and Halle are the nation's best singers right now. They have the soulfulness of Whitney Houston. I'm glad seeing Halle getting so much work and lighting up the screen with her divine presence. And Fantasia has been so underrated - she is The Voice. 👑🙏🏻❤
Y'all put fantasion in this b******* that did nothing for a long time except disrespect her mother on national TV!!!!! She sounds like a dying cat in heat!!!!!!
ok Halle Bailey no one can stop her
Hopefully it will be as good as the eoringina;
Just make a new movie. Does nobody have an original idea anymore?
I hated the 1st film.. A movie that demonizes black men.  Paints the picture of us beating and abusing our women.  Of course Oprah is executive producing this.  Of course the black woman flourishing and overcoming the oppressive black man is celebrated.  Its no wonder 98% of the positive comments are either from black women or white people.  Its a damn shame how divided we are as a community and how they play our men and women against each other and we don't even see it.
Looks amazing  can't wait
Only the trailer and already crying.
Yes
They don’t even come out with new movies anymore
Chills all OVER!!!!!!!!!
Where is white? Where is asian? Where is the diversity???
I love this movie 💜
Where's the diversities? I'm offended.
Not diverse enough
everything is a remake nowadays and all hollywood wants to do is help the democrat party to ressurect racism.lame!
Where’s all the white and Asian characters? WHERES THE DIVERISTY???!?
Someone was owed some favors if Fantasia was cast
Who is Fantasia, Taraji and Halle going to play in the movie?
My people are so lost . Any way to exploit our history 😢😢
This needs to be made for modern audiences! Meaning they need to race and gender swap the whole cast with white people Hispanics Asians etc. Yet another movie with just all black cast SHAME.
This didn’t need to be redone!  The original was perfect 💜. I’ve seen the movie thousands of times.  We didn’t see color growing up my sister and I saw the sisters❤. It will forever be a part of my childhood and life.  I guess I’ll give this one a try💜
This was a fun set. Just too hot on the sound stage
I already know that this soundtrack is going to be fire 🔥🔥🔥
Someone tell Elizabeth Banks.
what do they mean by a bold new take
At first I wasnt sure I wanted to see this until I saw the trailer, Oh yeh im there.
Theyve test screened this thing 4 times and didn't enter it in a single festival. Make of that what you will. Or else.just read up on what peiple thought from those test screenings. Not good.

So excited!!!!!
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't wait
Looks like it’s going to be really good💯 but wasn’t Ciara supposed to be apart of this too?
Anti white garbage. Fake history. Africa never had this and was never kangz n queenz n sheit. Ghew nonsense
Why isn’t everyone white in that movie?
Some classics were not meant to be remade and this is one of them.
But…. Why do we need a new movie? I always thought the original was a classic, sigh…
With with so many people fanning the flames of a gender war between BM and BW, I can't think of a worse time for such a project.
I can’t wait!   This trailer is mesmerizing!!! I pray it delivers!!!
This looks so amazing, the cast is so perfect.
Hollywood, you better cast Halle Bailey in more roles!
HALLE!!! 🙌🏻
Looks like a remake to me.
Fantasia is one of only a few artists with a rich, distict voice that carries soul in every note.
👀!!! 🥱..Ha'satan is SO desperate. ..
When
This is going to be one of the best movies of the year.
When is it releasing man. Dying to watch this😭🙌🏻
Who watched it ?
omgg ive been waiting for this for YEARS. ive always loved the book smmm and now the movies finally here!
I'm so excited, there aren't many remakes that shine through. But with this one I feel it will do justice
Im excited to see Tasty 😃
The original movie was really honest and raw.
I'm not saying the outcome of the Box Office of this movie, I just wish this movie had its own title so it can stand on its own. The original does not need a remake.
1:30 Fanatasia’s hands are even acting. Thats enough for her to sweep all acting awards.
🙄
If they're postponing the release of Dune in November, I definitely expect this to be held back too.
Damn, i love me some FANTASIA 😍🤤❤ i will be front row 👀
Hopefully this will erase the 1985 version. Today's actors are on a whole new level. Can't wait!
Why though?
They just can’t make originals anymore
This looks beautiful. But I hope false history won't be portrayed here. In many cases, it was the African kings -- the royalty of Africa -- who were capturing the distant tribal people and getting wealthy from their sale as slaves. The weaker, vulnerable tribes became the slaves, not the royalty nor the descendants of royalty. Alex Haley even admitted he was only creating a myth regarding the idea of African Americans descending from royalty.
The original Color Purple is probably my favorite movie. Why re-do something that is perfect? Is Hollywood out of ideas?
I haven’t been this excited to see a movie in a long time 😢
That voiceeeeeeee!!!!!
Oh yeah, This movies remake I will watch. Color Purple is a classic Masterpiece. This remake looks amazing. I’m sure to bring tissues with me. I can’t wait.
I’m here for Taraji and that’s it… she is the only if feel ACTUALLY fits her role…🥴
I loved the orginal so so much!!!! ....This looks like an excellent tribute and retelling of THE COLOR PURPLE...And that cast....Oh my....Can't wait!
Unbelievable
Yall don't have enough money for what yall put those woman threw.
Theam twilight
? Sarafina a white man
You all pissed me off
❗❗❗❗
?! Why?
0:07 - African Homeland 0:26 - Our Prayer 0:41 - Lily of the Field 0:50 - Big Dog 1:01 - Huckleberry Pie 1:07 - Push Da Button 1:11 - Push Da Button 1:33 - What About Love or Too Beautiful for Words 1:41: Our Prayer  1:44 - I'm Here 1:46 - Big Dog 1:47 - Mysterious Ways 1:56 - Brown Betty 1:59 - Big Dog?? 2:01 - Miss Ciley's Pants 2:02 - Shug Avery's Coming To Town
Whoever casted Taraji as shug Avery was spot on ✅🥳
Is it that colour purple by Alice Walker?
The movies open on Christmas 😂
Again this garbage?
I have had it in my syllabus as I did my graduation in English literature! I remember crying while reading the story and when i was asked to tell the summary of it infront of the class! Im so excited for this one ohmygod 😭 its my favourite book of all time and im all in for it💜 Alice Walker wrote a masterpiece 💜
We wuz meme still going strong.
Boooring.
I want to see this because it reminds me of the musical, so I have to get my tickets❤
Warner Brothers, please DO NOT bring this plantation ish back. In 2023, this is the last movie we black people need to depict us!
Where is diversity people c mon
This movie did a lot of harm to the black community according to Kevin Samuels
One of thee lamest movies ever made and it takes a 💩 on brothas
Hollywood is just creating more black-focused movies for donations
What’s the name of the song that’s playing
What Ray did for Jamie Foxx, this is going to do for Fantasia. I saw this trailer when I went to see Barbie and I was bawling.
its something about her voice
got me cyring
I can't wait!!!
Got chills watching. Can’t wait to see it.
What a Voice of Fantasia
I'm willing to give this a chance even though I know nothing can top the original with Whoopi Goldberg. If they take out the LGBTQ element though I'm out, that literally synched the original as a favorite core movie for me
Everytime I see this trailer it gives me chills. Especially when Halle says “we’re at the center of the universe”.
Fantasia Barrino is gonna get the Oscar! PERIOD.  Meet you on Oscars 2024
To be honest, I do not believe that this version will be even compareble to the  original version. That was the masterpiece of all times
Wow. I took my wife to the movies recently & I seen this trailer. Can’t believe they’re remaking such a classic, I grew up watching the color purple & it’s one of my favorite films. I hope this delivers, im going to watch this Forsure & I love casting choices
And you get an Oscar, and you get an Oscar, and you get an Oscar!
Great more we wuz
❤❤❤❤
I am eager to see this solely for the phenomenal cast.
The Color Purple has always been hard for me to read and watch. Beautiful but brings up too much for my heart to handle. I hope this movie and the actors get all their due. With the strike, they can’t promote it.
Even though the original film didn't win any of its nominations, Nobody will ever out perform Whoopi.
Lack of Diversity!
Can’t wait ! ❤
I want Halle to be Oscar nominated for thr year she ahd
It can't compare to the original with Whoopi.
Must see
I mean... Fantasia is just gold... She deserves the world, I feel like I'll cry like a baby on the theater
I’m definitely seeing this movie I’m Halle Baileys biggest fan
Take all my money.
Anything to do with Oprah, is a big PASS for me.
We wuz quangs?
This better be good....I love the novel and I can't wait to see it in cinemas
That trailer has awards all over this movie
I have no idea who Phylicia Pearl Mpasi is but she is giving me so much joy! I can’t wait to see her any everyone else on the big screen!
THIS IS THE ONE
I will sleep outside to get tickets to this one if I have to! ❤
Chills
well the original is a classic, they better do right by it. it looks good. here hoping.

"we royalty" LMAOOOO
Wait a minute!  I just saw that HER is going to be in it, too!  HER!!!  She's super talented  I am a fan of all four of these women! ❤❤❤
I can't wait to see this movie!  We ❤ you Ariel!  Then there is Fantasia, Taraji P. Henson and more ... dream cast!!!
Great let’s re make a masterpiece and ruin it and carry on this charade 🙄
Fantasia! Fantasia! Fantasia!!! 💥💥💥💥
This is gonna be so good love the original movie and I loved the play and just hearing fantasia sing I'm here on this trailer gives me the chills and goosebumps  such an emotional song SAd story  😢  it good to.see fantasia back in that screen  again
Omg, thank you. I read the book and watch the original movie a long time ago. I'm going to watch this too.
And next week "precious"
Oooo
I love to see our black women dominating legendary movies
My favorite song is “Mammy gets da watamelon cuz iza comin home”
Bruh y they making another one of these just leave the original one alone
Nice
I’m just now seeing this 🤯 this wow what a great remake trailer
They had me sold until I Realize its a musical , It pisses me off because I would love to see Taraji P Shugg Avery.The book by Alice walker is a masterpiece and the movie is timeless,if it ain’t broke don’t fix it 🥺😩I hope they didn’t f it up
the first movie was great and the play .. im sure this will be great too
I expect this will be a nice Christmas release, but the 1985 movie is a sparkling gem of a film, and proof that The Academy Awards can sometimes be stupid, or exclusive, and neglectful. For me, no other version, be it musical or whatever, will equal or eclipse that movie's power and emotions.
they know how to get me emotional... (whinper)
This is disgusting and gross Look at how f****** stupid is this why do they have to do this movie again  The first one was fine. It was authentic not f****** a copycat. You know it when I see movies like reminds me that the director or whoever created it and redid it is doing it because they have no talent or skills they just have to copy like a f******copycat. And you know who does that the most. F******scamming foreigners
This looks absolutely incredible. I fell in love with the book when I was growing up, and to see this grand production of it makes me so happy. Wow!
It feels like studios are still too afraid to draw attention to the fact that their films are musicals.
This looks stupid
Fantasy Island meets Color of Purple ,Watch the original release it’s a little more touch down on reality
Ooooo, film ain't even open yet, and the trailer got me in tears.
Spielberg remade "West Side Story" and it flopped. I would have thought he learned a lesson from that. I guess not.
When I heard about this, I was initially against it, because I love the 1985 film. It is one of my all time favorite movies.  But seeing the cast and who's directing, I'm looking forward to seeing it.
Looks like they missed the entire point of the original. Hope it's good, but this did not get my hopes up.
Why didn’t I know about this trailer coming out. Please please PLEASE be good
The people that were concerned about Halle Bailey, playing Ariel, ;would have no concern about her being in this Movie. I’m so elated for all of them. I can’t wait to see it. I know it will be over the top fantastic!!!
Please don't messed this classic up iam from eatonton ga home of Alice walker author of the book I even live on the street named after her cause coming to America 2 was trash 🗑️
saw this trailer in theaters. heard the first “I” and started crying uncontrollably
No, this will never even be the garbage of the sole of the original oelicula
“Ain’t nobody tell me nothing!!”
... maybe
I always wanted to see the Nettie's side of the color purple and Hailey would've been perfect but she still did Ariel🥰
Our dear Tasia getting the spotlight she deserves 👆🏻
“We wuz qweens n’ sheit”
The original means so much to me in every way i can verbally explain!
black people forgetting other races exist, where's the news at?
FANTASIA!!!  👏👏👏👏👏
Fantasia has not aged a day since Amerocan Idol oh my days
Nothin can replace the original BUT i do love that Oprah has a part in producing this new one. Im interested in what they mean by "a bold new take" on the film 🤔 i do know its gonna be fantastic. Theres no way it couldn't be w that cast! 👏 👏 👏
Can't wait going be good
Crazy no one called this woke
This film doesnt look very Diverse or Inclusive.
Unnecesary remake...
I know i'll cry like a mf
I’ve watched the trailer a few times but I can’t wait to see the movie….. December can’t get here fast enough…. My friends will see it a few times because of course every movie you see something different and I don’t want to miss nothing. Fantasia gone sing 🎤 she’s so underrated and we love her so much. Oprah know what she’s doing and see the greatness in her.
I Wana know why remake  a film that just existed
okay... there is a tear in my eyes...😢🤧
Ohh remake I hope is good The original ❤
а где же белые в главных ролях? что за дискриминация?
amaze
Definitely skipping this trash.
Why they redo it smh I love Halle but the light vs dark need to stop
And now there's a musical with it some new songs on this movie
The New remake of the Color purple (1985) And Haile is new character as Celia
I wish I *WOULD* watch this remake. Some hot, anti-Black male Hollywood garbage. FOHWTBS
More woke garbage
Whose story
She got legs, you iiiiidiot!
I don't know where the concern trolls crawled from, all late and wrong, but this is not a straight up remake. This is based on the award-winning Broadway musical. MUSICAL. This is not a straight retelling of the Color Purple, which you would know if you genuinely cared and weren't jumping to conclusions for clout. BTW, the Color Purple was originally  a novel. It's a story that's been successfully told across multiple mediums, and if you bothered to know anything about the play, you'd have the audacity to be excited, because it is excellent.
Some classics need to be left alone. Now the original will lose some of it's nostalgia because they made another one. It stood alone with nothing to compare it to. Not anymore.
It will be hard to beat the original film.
Y’all better get those box office numbers up and see it in theaters opening weekend!
oscar contender
Im ready for you tasia, have always been...
Fantasia ,voice brings tears to my eyes ,😢😢😢
I think people should stop doing remakes of classics.
This movie is definitely going to send out a bright light of sunshine!!!! Things might get bad in the beginning but later on down the road get better especially when it's your time to shine bigger and brighter!!!! 💗💕 I'm seeing this movie!!!!
Good thing they are keeping the black on black abuse in and not trying to black wash it.
The Color Purple A Bold Of APOLLO (parrot)
Just the trailer and I'm crying already.
H.E.R ❤
I saw the first color purple in the movies and remember how long the lines were I left the theater crying it was so touching.
I lost respect for Hollywood and the people involved in this nonsense because you do not remake a classic.
I feel ,this movie is little bit same of , mr pip story 🤷
Wait, why isn't she white now?
Im literally watching this daily until it comes out😂
Already seen it.
The reincarnation of Suge Avery is what I’m living for
Purple
That cast wow this is gonna be freaking amazing I can't be the only one who came to tears watching this one!
Lol a movie she fits in
Why do the color purple again depressing …… why don’t they do a true story about the American Indians
The original one is far beyond a masterpiece then this cheap knock off version 😆😂
Why remake perfection?
There’s another film called this, which had Whoopi Goldberg in it
Can't beat the original.
I can see now why youtube got rid of the dislike button 😂.  Of course They have to remake a classic.
Hard Pass
I saw Danielle on Broadway she was incredible. I’m so excited for this.
In my opinion, it def doesn't look good enough to compare to the original, but it might be a good watch.
We wuz queens 🙌🏿
I truly hope this hits
Wish they had gotten cynthia erivo for celie.
This wont do well at the box office.
Omg I just found this out just now! I love the original and this one will match it and be just as good as well
No need for this
@ Cast 🔥🔥🔥💣💣💣👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿🎤🎤🎤♥️🥰♥️
Halle is so bad bro def gonna watch just cause of her
Fantasia's voice brings me to tears with a single note!!!
TAKE MY MONEY!!!
It is written by Alice Walker❤
It is very helpful for all under Graduate students for complete their realisations and exam also....so very excited to see this
eeep im emotional
OMFG im living!!!! I love the original so much and they new one looks so beautiful and filled with such a talented class of excellence. I will be seated promptly on Christmas day.
I want to see it, but I'm going to have a hard time trying not to compare every actor, scene, and choice in direction to the original. It was so memorable and stellar that the entire movie is solidified in my head.
What a great cast!! Go Fantasia Go!! Cant wait to see this film!!!
I hope they give them their flowers this time because they didn't want to when it first came out. I'm so excited!
I a. Excited! We need a good movie now! Penny
Disney should make the cartoon about it
This trailer touched my soul. I can’t wait to support this movie. This trailer showed what’s missing from movies nowadays.. a heartfelt story that needs to be told.
I just know Fantasia is going to give me everything 💜
I got misty on this trailer! Oh my gawd! If the world hasn't ended by December '23 (LOL) I'll be watching this!
another repeated film🙄.... this is only to applaud the lack of creativity... Is Spielberg trying to get those Oscars that in his time was more difficult with the previous one and it is safer to win? 🤔 because the previous actors were excellent.....only times on the other spectrum just as bad....
Not me crying
Ooofff the feels
I can't wait to see fantasia in this again I love listening to her or Cynthia Erivo performing this.
*Beyonce should´ve been Sugar this time*
the classic is a masterpiece and it looks like it is going to honror it's memory
Very nice and I can't wait. I wish it was shot on film though. The clean digital cameras make it look too polished. The natural grain of film would add more of a theatrical look too it.
I love that they made all the fonts purple as well,  the movie already looks INCREDIBLY beautiful 💜
This movie destroyed the black family
This looks fantastic! I can't wait!
I will stick with Whoopi’s version, her acting is top notch and it wasn’t a musical
Another movie that has no reason to exist. The Color Purple has already been done. Why does Hollywood keep remaking classics? The copy is never as good as the original.
I'll pass. Not into musical at all.
This better win some awards! This looks wonderful!
can't wait to see it
Congrats Halle ❤
i just KNOW this is so good
little mermaid 2 ? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Just give Fantasia the Oscar right now pls and thanks
Spielberg, Oprah, and Quincy Jones, .....3 of the biggest criminals in the world. Here is a rabbit hole for you, look into their parents and their closest friends.
This was one movie that did not need to be remade stop messing with our classics
GO TASIA !!!!! I CANT WAIT TO SEE YOUR PERFORMANCE. IM SO PROUD OF YOU.
Yes u are bby
TAKE MY MOOONNNEEEYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 :---)
July fire alert
Why she is doing remake instead of original movie
I can't wait to see Halle to hit the spot  in the movie like she did it with Little Mermaid😄
This looks SO good...
This is going to be epic!!!! Perfectly casted!!! Can't wait to be apart of a production like this!!!
Hoppo fine and he gonna beat you.
Why are the characters all black?  I thought we were being inclusive.  Nettie should be Mexican and Ceily should be white since Ariel is black now.
Lame.
Where is MERYL STREP IN ALL THIS
this should be made w white people!
Can’t wait
#chills This will be a family event.
4.k rese resolution movies link for 20 past 60 years
Chillzzzz
This the only remake I can actually say I can’t wait to see. Fire cast like the original. Me and my family will be there in full support 🫶🏾
Ahhhh I saw my favorite joyful song! Miss Ceiliees pants!!!!!
Whoopi and Oprah's acting was better
By "a bold new take", they really mean "100% less Jewy!"
I can’t wait to see this!! 💜
Amazing
I'm excited that Corey Hawkins is in it (as well as Halle). I loved him in "In the Heights." I think he'll do a great job in this movie.
Prada This
This Gon Go So Crazyyyy ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
I am impressed by the sequences of this wonderful trailer, it is an art, carefully capturing the details. Am I the only one who perceives them?💎
Where is the diversity?
Honestly this didn’t need a remake .. the original is a classic also is that fanatasia?
So, if this movie was all white people it would be a scandal.
This was my favorite movie growing up with my cousin. we used to act it out...funny part is, I am Almost white and I played Celie and she played Nettie...My cousin died of an overdose in 2021, I would cut my right arm off to go see this with her in the movies.
Didnt they make this movie before?
Another damn movie demonizing black men 🤦‍♂️
Wow  nothing but propaganda I guess the programming is wearing off the have to reprogram the BW to look at the BM as the enemy
trailer soundtrack????
They better show tf out in this!!!!💪🏽❤️
The original was an absolute master piece, I am excited to see how they did with the remake I love this movie
This is how you remake a classic music
Awwww so niceeee🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
Omg they are remaking my favorite movie of all time and wow it looks great now remake  Rosewood Colors “the old school gang movie”
This is going to have go some to beat the original and the book which I both adore. Being honest, Whoopi will always be Celie to me. Even after all these years, the final scenes of the film with her and Akosua Busia still make me cry. All the very best to the new cast though, and I hope people stand up and recognise Fantasia as I think she's so underrated as a performer.
I was so worried when I heard about this being done. I thought it was a remake and nothing could beat the original. Seeing this trailer however… I can’t wait to watch it.
WTF, did you redo this movie? No thanks. I own the original and love it.
1:09 From Directing 2021's West Side Story to Producing 2023's The Color Purple
I can see this movie being at the top at Grammy and the OSCARS🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆😉
I remember having the hard copy of this book then it mysteriously got stolen
I swear Fantasia gives me chills every time she sing
Does Fantasia get to see her shister again?
oh yes please. i love this story, and hope kids today would appreciate it, too.
Date: 16th June 2023 Like/Dislike ratio: 35K/16K
The African country portrayed in the trailer is Ghana 🇬🇭🇬🇭
There’s no way this beats the original
Unsubscribed   Any girl who sleeps with the directors u make them actress 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
It was inevitable. A WOKE The Color Purple. I won't be watching this farce. I'll just rewatch Spielberg 's version.
I'm gonna cry so hard
This is a fantastic film make for Black Peole. great voices, excellent film
Just a reminder that Alice Walker is antisemitic.
Here for Halle! 💙
Boooooooo thumbs down. .  Leave classic movies alone.
They didn't remake it with white people instead? Where is the woke progression?
This right here is Black History shout out to the great women involved in this film❤❤
Oprah produces the movie, now I see why it resembels so much to the first one she acted in. Very cool!
Do your things my African sisters
What would happen if little mermaid and this was against each other for the Oscars or Tonya
jeez this movie full of black
Why does the advertising team make any Black centric movies and decided to make the trailer like this, like it some action film.
ayo what...
Who else started crying as soon as Fantasia started singing? Can't wait to see her and Joe in concert!
The first one was so moving. This looks good, but they sure do have some big shoes to fill.
Please don’t judge me y’all I watched the original movies for the first time a week ago 😂 since this is the musical version I hope it’s not as traumatizing but I’ve also never read the book so…
THE COLOR PURPLE was one of my first movie the grandparents treated me to on the big screen. the TITANIC was second. I cried like a bby both movies.  looking forward to this prequel of Purple.
I can already smell the wins during awards season
I just know the soundtrack will be like the choirs in heaven
What’s up with all the remakes??!
Is Taraji and Fantasia gonna bump coochies like celie and shug did in the book? I’m here for it
Halle is such an amazing Actress!! 💜
I can't wait no more ,🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧 idk how many times I have watched this trailer
I need to read the book again before watching the movie. I MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE !
ONG H.E.R is acting now!? Okay get it❤❤
las canciones de esta película T-T
Aww her hat is a halo 😇😇😇💜💜💜
Why do American blacks care so much about being African royalty, they sold them to Europeans.
The purple drank!
WE
It could be just the trailer or I'm biased towards the original but this looks really really bad.
My dad always told me that this movie should have won at least one if not won Academy Awards. He thinks it didn't because of the white people who did not vote for it. I can see that now. He loved the movie.
❤
i hope they keep Sugar and celiie's romance like in the book this time
Can't wait for this 💜
😂😂 they playim u
That’s gone be good
Playlist da joanna
This gave me chills. All I can say is wow
Sooooo I'm gonna need first day of the pandemic tissue 😭😭😭😭😭
Just did some background check on the people behind it. It’s directed by the same man who worked on ‘Black Is King’ (Beyoncé). So you know the visuals will be breathtaking. I can’t wait. ❤
Zero diversity, that sucks
One of my favorite movies...cannot wait to see it reimagined. So excited!!!🎉❤🎉
I absolutely cant wait , i remember when i went to seen a play fantasia was in the color purple in Hollywood when i was 17 ..i used to be in a girl group in the complex i lived in and we would go on tiny field trips so i seen my first big play. It was exciting the music and acting but most of all i loved the lights in the play it was like a movie but i was wishing they had a actual movie with fantasia starring and here we are now , a movie that is so heart warming and striving starring Hallie and fantasia, im excited , and Whoopi G is back so im exited for my 90s classic as well🤎
More Black Women Empowerment movies to make Women more Independent & discouraged from being with Black Men!!
Purple lives matter
I dont see any purple color here. I see dark colors. hmm
another  we are victim black movie
A Trailer that makes me cry!  OMG!  I am ready to see this! Come on Sisters!
HALLE MY BABY❤
Dudo mucho que le llegue a los tobillos a la película de spilberg
When does the movie come out? 😭
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS except for some parts i really want my daughter to see this CRT #woke
For those who are jumping the gun, this movie is not a reboot of the 1980s movie. It's an adaptation of the Broadway musical
As much as I love this movie, I have to ask: What the F* was wrong with it so they need to make the same one again ??? kinda lame :/
Taraji, Fantasia, Halle... some of my absolute faves in 1 project. Fingers crossed that it delivers as it should
Won't beat the soul the original beholds. God is tryna tell you something!!! I listen to that, goosebumps every time
Omg Fantasia!!!!! Yessssssss
I hope Fantasia gets her flowers! Great casting.
Really the movie did not need a remake I can’t 🤦🏾‍♀️ smh
the color brown?? guys what the heck u cant call a movie that
Does she desevse
Can’t wait to see this on big screen !! All my favorite  actors. Love you all ladies. God bless.🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️
Nice viewtyfull
Why they didn't make this movie with white people, so it can be inclusive. There's no any Lgbt characters neither. Not inclusive enough. And Halle still bad at acting, please keep singing.
Looks amazing!!
The fact they showed Halle 1st in the trailer and her talking at the end , it’s definitely a 😂 😂 moment to all the little Mermaid 🧜‍♀️ Haters..Another huge film
Do they beat blqcks in this movie ?
Two minutes and twenty-four seconds of full-body goosebumps <3 <3 <3
I guess I'm the only person not excited to see this
It’s gonna be depressing
Omg! Why am I tearing up?????
Omg The Actors!! Phenomenal!!! I m truly excited ❤❤❤
This wont be anywhere as good as the orig
이것도 백인으로 하지 왜
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Soundtrack gonna be lit
I can't wait
My heart!!! Omg, there isn’t one person I didn’t love in this trailer. Can’t wait to see this! 💜
Fantasia and Halle Bailey! I need to see this.
I cant wait to watch this
Another empowering black film.... much excited to watch this masterpiece.
Who asked for this? The original is a classic and didn’t need to be touched.
Good lawd not another one.
Saw Fantasia on Broadway… she was a late replacement for the role originated by LaChanze who won the Tony for Best Actress in a Musical. So she wasn’t eligible. Surely she would have been nominated bc her performance was powerful…   Fun Fact: Cynthia Erivo also won the Tony for Best Actress for the revival which was, in most people’s opinion, a better and truer adaptation of Walker’s novel than the original Bway production.
This trailer is SO FKN GOOD!!!
yaaaaaasssss I can't wait <3
Eu preciso MUITO ASSISTIR!!
Why this movie wasn't with the main characters as white?... it is really common now a days use the opposite.
Welcome back Fantasia ❤️
🙃
They should have re-made it but using only white actors. fairs fair.
I'm happy for Ms Tasia, CONGRATULATIONS 🎉❤!!!! I see the Ghanaian Kente Fabric and the Akan tribe dance at the start 😍😍😍
I don’t want to wait til December 😭
Florida: Ban it.
hope the baby scene isn't in this version.
2023 another slave movie from producers that absolutely adore slavers i cant wait...
Why a musical
The original was so beautiful and heartbreaking, and yet so uplifting... I hope this one if the same.
The music gave me chills! This is it! this is fantasias time!!!!
I am not f*cking ready for this😭😭😭😭😭
OH! LORD!
Me supporting black films and black women in the entertainment industry and in real life has not improved or better my life in any way
I'm crying. Bob and Monet were right. This is going to be glorious!! 🤧🤧🤧🤧
Why remake this ????
I hate that I'm going to watch this..
Not Nother slave remake 🙄
Conseguiram estraga mais um clássico 🤦👎
I dislike Halle Bailey she's not that great at acting . But The color purple was one of my favorite movies growing up .Hopefully they don't mess it up because this movie is a classic
I'm not even sure how I'm gonna make it through the whole thing; the trailer has me in tears.
Dayumn I don’t usually like remakes of already great classic movies but this movie definitely looks awesome especially with the cast. Can’t wait!
And we can all say that 2023 it’s  Halle Bayley’s YEAR 🔥
Henson is not Suge...maybe that singer Taylor who won on The Masked Singer..that's Suge...O thinking money and praying for a Oscar for herself...this ambitious sister must win...
I CAN NOT WAIT!!!!! The Trailer gives me chills! 😩
So stunning and brave
The should make the main character white!
I just hope that the portrayal of Celie and Shug's relationship is faithful to the romance of the book.
Taraji P. Henson, uma das mulheres negras mais importantes do cenário do cinema atual. Este filme vai ser um espetáculo a parte.
Wow
Omg Fantasia has been a core part of my childhood as a positive memory. I traded up watching her return.
So many amazing female actors ❤ I love this
Gonna be really hard to top the original, borderline impossible
watching this for Halle <3 !!
These amazing actors, men and women all deserve Oscar's this time around.
1:48 on the left in the front row are my town friends and I'm so happy that there in the movie and I'm proud and I love them so much ❤❤❤
Huge Oscars contender!
Why? The other one stills so recent
They wanted to be recognized by everyone including their own origin.
Meet halle bailey on the right moviee
You know that the book was anout lesbians? Yeah
The little mermaid was just the beginning, give them a reason to hate love!!!❤❤❤
I can’t wait to watch this!
The mother.
Erykah badu our suge . Our billie
I just can see Ariel right now 😢
OMGGGG!!😍😍
Why would anyone want to remake this horror film 😑
OMFG HALLE IS BOOKED AND BUSY MEANWHILE CHLOE'S CAREER IS... ANYWAYS SHE'S REALLY BECOMING A BONAFIDE STAR AND IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'LL GO MORE INTO ACTING EVEN IF SHE LOVES SINGING MORE WITH ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES SHE'S GETTING
FANTASIA AND JHUD REUNION PLEASE
Hollywood has no new ideas. This is so sad. Hollywood is dying in my lifetime 😩
I'm not holding my breath 🫁 for this one
Not interested. It didn’t need a remake. The original was classic. How about stop being lazy and come up with some new inspiring African American films🤷🏿‍♀️
I pretty much watch this everyday
black people are the best actors in the world, bring it, bring more and more black movies please.
Jim Carrey was right. hollywood is not cool anymore
Fantasia is back 💚
I just discovered the original Steven Spielberg  movie the last few months with Whoopi and I can't believe there is already a remake!
I will never support anything Oprah does because of what she did to our beloved brother Michael Jackson after his death.
The long-awaited movie for The Color Purple is the original Whoopy Goldberg Danny Glover.
And the Oscar goes to… FANTASIA BARRINO! …… I can already hear it. She better get her due. She has worked hard for so long and been through so much. This is the role of her career, and I hope they recognize it!
Yassss Fantasia!
Flop
HALLE TO LIGHT FOR THIS PART NETTIE WAS DARKSKIN.. I THINK JANELLE MONAE WOULDVE BEEN A BETTER FIT.
Danielle Brooks THEY COULD HAVE NOT PICKED A BETTER PERSON TO PLAY SOFIA ROLE//// LOVE IT
Looks so good! The original drags on at times but I'm here for Ms.Ceily
I have hope this movie will do the story justice! It has all the makings of a great film. Make it happen please. ♥
-9 out of 10
pure trash haha
More anti white propaganda. Yippee same ol narrative
Who else can’t stop rewatching this trailer?😢 like can’t this release this a lot sooner?? Don’t tease us like this
When The Animaniacs New Movie 2022
Halle Bailey идёт на хуй. А сам фильм скорее проходная драма на раз.
🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫 🟫👁🟫🟫🟫🟫👃🏾🟫🟫🟫🟫👁🟫 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
This girl only do remakes ??
Up here she belong
I see this can get away with an all black cast. Try making a movie with just white folk: impossible. Literally impossible. All we need do now, is sit back, wait for the Oscars and watch as it sweeps all the awards. Guaranteed. I said it nere first.
“Oh wow!  I hope they remake The Color Purple! “ said no one ever.
Ok, I will give it a chance 🙌🏽
Happy Hannukkah to you too, murderous producers.
Wow
I dont remember them being a pair of narcissists😐
So that means if my ancestors come from europe,am i royalty too?🤔
Why aren’t white people playing the main roles?!
I have a feeling I'll love this one as much as the first
They cast a light skin black girl  as Nettie the "pretty one" ,weird . The original actress playing her was dark skinned and absolutely gorgeous , and she could act very well ! another miscast for this poor girl Halle Bailey . she already has her hands full with the little mermaid , but thankfully she can rely on the singing parts  . as For Celie, the girl they cast (Fantasia) is WAY too pretty to play her ,  way prettier than Haley Bailey , so it's confusing .
Woah goosebumps all over
John: wait, quincy jones? The one who works the fresh prince of bel air? Bring back quincy jones to fix bel air mess.
There's sth about this movie that makes it feel so special
Lollll. Laugh riot.
I can’t wait!
Yes💜
This movie is a black classic 💜 I know this version go be so amazing 🥲 Taraji P and Hailey 🙌🏽
hmmm, I don't know....I LOVE the original movie and from this trailer I doubt it captures all the emotion and tragedy. But I'm willing to be proven wrong!
I really love the OG 1985 film & this one looks like a fresh new take 💜
Adding African culture in the beginning of this trailer is so misleading and disrespectful. It is a literal erasure of Black American culture in the US 🇺🇸.   The original movie captured Black Americans and our life stories very well, no need for a remake honestly. Black Americans are not African and we do not identify with African culture. We have been in America for over 400 years and developed our own culture and unique identity.
A story made by a self confessed black male hater. This is a remake for more division. THUMBS DOWN
I absolutely cannot wait to see this. The Color Purple has and always will be one of my favorite movies.
WOW! Even if this was a remake, it looks better than the OG! I’m definitely going to see this!
I'm excited for Hailey and bro is this black panther part3
I just watched this trailer and as soon as I heard Fantasia's voice. I literally burst into tears. This movie is gonna be one of the best for 2023. Can't wait for Christmas
Now THIS! This is what celebrating black excellence for me. Telling the story of black people, touching everyone's hearts. Glad Halle Bailey is in here to wash away that Little Mermaid controversy. Also casting Fantasia Barrino to match the excellent broadway rendition by Cynthia Erivo. Can't wait for it to appear in the cinema! 💜💜💜
What's next wemens of Brewster's Place? Lean on me?
I like this ❤❤
Fantasia nah
Can't wait to see Fantasia on the big screen.
How many more color purples do we need
The acting does not seem to be as good as in the original
So it's a musical?  The original will always be one of my favorite movies. First time I cried so hard watching a movie gave me a headache.
Omg it’s Halle  baliey
I guess Hollywood can’t racebend this one.
Was not aware this was in the making, so I am watching with my mouth in awe.  Not sure if this going to be the musical version like the Broadway version was but with Fantasia and Halle there no doubt there going to be some great singing going in this movie.
Why did this bring tears to my eyes? I already know that this cast is going to be incredible
🚮🚮 why could they not have used another dark skinned woman for Nettie?! This is why these remakes be so hilarious and a slap in the face at the same time! Keep the dark skin representation! We're tired of representation of dark skin women being overshadowed! I don't care I don't care!
I can't wait to see the church part. The original make me cry every time
*Disney little mermaid 2.0*
girl...no.
Not poor, black and abused Little Mermaid!? 🧜‍♀️ you were my hope Halle.. you didn’t have to go out like this 😢💔 it’s not even relatable anymore. All of YOU didn’t have to go out like this. 🖤✊😔
I don't understand how they can make a musical out of this I read the book when I was in my first year of high school, 1982, there's no musical material here. Hard pass
Steven spill berg❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This looks incredible 🥹❤‍🔥
Oh wow now I wanna see this seen the little mermaid like a day Ago it was amazing 😻
It must be Asian😢
i wonder what dumb excuses people will use to hate on this
WE GOTTA WAIT TILL CHRISTMAS????? 😭😭😫
Why are they not race-swapping this remake? Should be played by Asian or Latino actors also. Sick and tired of overrepresented black people already.
I want to see this!
Pointless remake that no one was asking for.
Is there two different Celie or is it just me?
crazy! i just found the book and planning to read it today and this pops up in my youtube home page
Why is there no outrage over this? is it because its showing black women being poor and abused?
I get this is not a remake but so much of the trailer focuses on bailey. Right after the little mermaid too. It seems like the studios are typecasting her.
Ohhhhh... my heart it's fully and cozy!
Halle kept her clothes on and got pushed into stardom! I love it!
oooh. held back some tears. can't wait to watch this.
I love everyone involved but I the casting is very odd for Seeley. Though I love Halle and Fantasia… they look nothing alike and aren’t even close to the same skintone. I had to read the comments to know that they were playing the same character at different ages but I still think it will be good and I can already tell their performances will be amazing!
Nah. I'm good
Congratulations 🌹 🎊
I voted a thounsand times for fantasia on idol and I would do it again. Perfection.
Goosebumps!!!! I have to watch it, I won't even wait for blu ray, Day 1 in theatres I'll be there...
OH I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS😭😭😭
WTF
We wuz kangz n shiett!
Wow fantasia acting and singing
I love color purple 💜
im going to cry tears againnnnn
Goosebumps...
Ok but.... can we have new movies??? With other storys ???... Like...why are all the "good movies" remakes that have come out in recent years? seems like the new generation doesn't have that much imagination and the old ones are probably too old to still be in business... thats a big Problem
ERRYBODY IN THIS MOVIE❤❤❤
I was scared n was totally against it until now now I see the acting n now I can’t wait
What does Alice Walker think of this?
great another movie for Halle to destroy
They are in Production! of a New Purple Rain Movie! Starring Mark Anthony!.
I can’t wait to see this!
Kevin Samuels is rolling in his grave about this movie!😞
No thanks lmaon
down vote this into oblivion please.
The color purple is color of bruises and meaning behind title. It's about a black man beating and abuse of black women. Of course it's going to cause divisiveness and that's why Hollywood loves to make movies about evil black men to reinforce the negativity and division while a gender war is going on, bravo.   Thanks for portrayal of black men in negative roles as usual you little useless pieces of garbage
Go Phylicia our DRC Congo 🇨🇩 queen. We are proud of you and all you doing ❤️ Shine our 🌟
Yeah ik sure this go help the black community yep definitely going to bring them closer together bot more division all i see is sellouts, definitely slave movie is perfect right now just dumb
Love the movie, but yeah..... this one I think: Do we reeeaalllyyy needeed that? ;S I dont think so. I want NEW CLASSICS, not Cntrl C Cntrl V from old ones
They love trying ro make bm look evil and profit from it as usual smh
This is terrible they need to leave the color purple alone so surprised Oprah gave the green light. Wow. Nothing off limits these days
All I Know, This Is Gonna Be Good ❣️!.
Will this be available to watch at home, or streamed? Or just in theaters?
,,🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
U know what? Im gonna treat this like a brand new movie and not compare it to the original film.
This movie is pure propaganda against the black man's image. The black women is strong the black man an inhumane brute beast and you must always be afraid of him because he is dangerous. And anything that happens to him is therefore justified because he is nothing but a monster. Black women must stick together and be independent from him because he can't be trusted and will harm you. They are reprogramming the younger generation of women. Black American men are the most agreeable men on the planet! Black men will never sit around and let a man like mister exist. We would've took him out to the woods and he wouldn't have returned!💯✊🏾
trash
Fantasia getting her flowers
"Center of the Universe"?, oh ok. So that's the reason behind the behavior. Got it.
I'm already crying 😢 👏👏👏👏👏👏
wow
ima be honest after i see this ion wanna see anymore slave movies...seriously
"We are at the center of the universe" What an arrogant statement.
The new Color Purple looks so good it makes me want to rewatch the old one.
This is being pitched and pushed for every reason, but it needing a refresh.
Smh...
Some movies should ever be remade. Color purple is a classic
This looks hella good
less ethnic movies pls
Tasha Jeffersonnnnnn❤❤❤❤
Im tired of the remakes but im here to support Fantasia
i didn't know the color purple has a musical too! my cousin gave me the book as gift a while ago, i need to read it before watch the movie!
I'm confused who's playing Suge,  Queen Latifah or Taraji P Henson?
Yes I wanna see that
This is only the trailer but I’m already chopping onions. Darn it, I hope it’s as good as it looks.❤
I was crying when I saw this trailer before seeing the The Little Mermaid. I heard the first lines of “I’m Here” set off the waterworks.   I am READY. I AM READY FOR THESE QUEENS!
It looks so beautiful and gave me tingles all over ,it’s so nice to see real black stories that isn’t woke or white shaming white people, it’s just a beautiful film about two sisters and beautiful sining and music.they need to make more films like this and for everyone to enjoy ,no political engenders just a really good movie 💜
i don't need another adaption of this. It's guttwrenching, heartbreaking and sickening! as always for christmas. we don't need the drama or the trauma on christmas. we aint gon forget, the pain of the past is rushing through our veins, through the ancestors that were not allowed to go to school. we all have them in our bloodlines, we know the pain, we know why we don't trust nobody with our children! it made me cry to see another generation come to play this...
those last lines are so cringe and narcissistic. not sure this needed a remake tbh. original was decent.
Man Im so ready for this! The cast is amazing!! Fantasia's voices always gives me goosebumps along with tears in my eyes. Lord Lord Lord!❤❤❤Now Christmas seems so far away.
We need more black superheroes and role models … as per Jada PS, we don’t have enough
Very surprised in this day and age of diversity been wedged in to every single movie and TV show, why isn't one of the sisters white...??   Inclusion an all....
🖤🖤
Halle started out acting.  Along with her sister. She was also an actress on grownish. But even before that she was acting. Her sister too  (Fighting Temptations among others) Then she later went on to singing.
I AM HERE FANTASIA!!! 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
The fact that Fantasia has never been in a movie before is shocking
I'm happy for miss fantasia😍😍
This movie looks good some people are just angry and stuck in their ways they don’t wanna see no changes nothing is wrong with a new spin on a classic sometimes, if it’s not you for you that’s fine but for the people who want to see and think it’s good can we please enjoy the movie stop being so angry at life
Fantasia and cast is gonna be incredible
Halle is thriving and I love this for her
Super super super EXCITED 🥳
АААА НЕГРЫ ААААА

WOW!

Waiting for Someone to Post a Hateful comment for No reason in the comments 🙃    Because I know they want to
The original is literally my favorite movie of all time and I can’t wait to see this new version
Warner Bros ESG score gonna go through the roof with this one! 🎉🎉🎉
You people are sick
🤮
As a kenyan I'm saying no thank you, I'm sick and tired of seeing black american movies where they're slaves, oppressed or gangsters all the time
Half dislikes 🤔
Vi la original en los 80 en el cine y después en dvd espero que sea emocionante hasta las lágrimas como la original
I know that mansion is in Atlanta, anybody know what street Please?
വെയ്റ്റിംഗ്... Waiting ❤
Can’t wait
Who's a filmmaker here, I can give an idea it will bring box office down, we just sit back and watch closely
Oh cool. "Black Men Are Evil" the movie.
I haven’t watched the movie adaptación of the book, but I heard the soundtrack of the broadway version. Incredible songs.
The color purple was a horrible movie just despicable" I hope the remake flops👎🏾
African needs to give more birth like China then you can be more stronger
They wish you don't exist on the gold you are sitting on
Naw I’m not feeling this movie at all. To co existing it got to pay some homage to the original.
bro this movie dont need a remake
When will people learn 😂 black people cannot be white, our culture cannot be like yours, the cat and mouse can never be friends, stop this childplay, we know what you guys have done 👍
Yes.we are the center of the universe .
Fantasia has a beautiful spiritual voice God has truly blessed her❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Can’t wait! 💗💜💗💜💗💜
I. WILL. BE. THERE.
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
Wow the musical. This is gonna be great ❤.
WE
I see Ghana in the cut 🇬🇭. Let's go!
Imagine if they did to this what they did to european based stories and characters....  yeah that'd never be allowed.
Amazing
OMG
The book was very good. I was hoping since we saw the original movie so many times.... Whooooo hasn't?  So much of it  we quote something over and over again. 🤣🤣🤣 Now it looks like it's made from the book too.  I never saw the play.  I wonder will it have the Christmas scene like the other one? That could be why it's coming out on Christmas?""" Because it looks like it should be a Summer movie.  But it was a Christmas scene too.  Where they could call it a Christmas special.   ( The Christmas Scene quotes) """( Ms. Milli).. """   U can spend the whooole day with your family  won't that be nice Sophia? The whollle,  day!  ( Sophia) " Family?""( Ms Milli).. .   "" When was the last time U saw your children?"... ( Sophia) """  I haven't seen my chilen in 8 yaaaaz!"... (Ms Milli)... "  Well that's a shame, but tomorrow U can spend the whollle day." 2023 Hope U all enjoy it. 😍
We need this. ✨
Way to go Philicia Mpasi, so proud of you. I predicted some day you will be an actress. My the the light of the Lord shine on you baby girl. Pride of the DRC👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 kende libosoeeeeeee. Mokako swaaaaaaah
Even if this WAS a remake (i know it's not), i would argue that this is one of the pieces of media that's actually a good case for remakes - when the original movie was made, it was way too risky to really explore the relationship between Shug and Celie the way that we could now and the way it deserves.
OMGGGGG I CANNOT wait!!!!!!!!!!
😍
Hugeeeee shoutout to our Congolese sister and Maryland native Phylicia Pearl Mpasi on her big screen debut as young Celie!!! 🤩👏🏾We’re sooo proud of you Phylicia!! ❤️🇨🇩
🥲❤ I already know Fantasia will have everyone in movie theaters across the world on their feet whenever the scene for the "I Am Here Performance" comes on! Don't even get me started with this remarkable cast! 10's across the board
Nope. No musical.
I love teraji but she always seems like the same character in every movie.
You know black folk gonna act a fool seeing this on Christmas... Myself included 🤣🤣🤣
Wtf...
Black live matter . When will asian live matter . I want to make movies too
Tired of seeing my people doing these kinda movies🤦🏾, the producers know exactly what agenda they are pushing. They want us to victimise ourselves every chance we get, its genuinely annoying now and I bet the dislikes show I’m not the only one. As soon as I saw Operah and Steven pedoberg were involved I instantly knew yup here we go again with the brainwashing and violins
Oh lord, the first movie broke my heart and I don’t need those feels again!
More (black) male bashing from woke culture. Fellas, boycott, avoid and ignore. #sysbm
❤❤❤❤
Y'all better represent Ghana 🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭 🙌🏿💯
It's nice to see two Disney princesses in one film. Halle (Ariel) and H.E.R. (Belle)
I like Halle better as Ariel in The Little Mermaid 🧜‍♀️
She's better as Ariel in The Little Mermaid 🧜‍♀️
💜💜💜
so excited for this !
I have never had a reason to google  presale movie tickets before...🤗
Every once in a while I wonder what happened to Fantasia. My jaw dropped when I saw her! So happy to see her and I can't wait!
Why is fantasia not bigger than she is. She got the pipes and bawdie.  Tasia- Mae that girl frfr
I’m sobbing full chills
The Color Purple with Oprah and Whoopi made me cry. Looks like this one is going to be a tear jerker too😫
THEY WANT US TO KEEP REPEATING & RELIVING SLAVERY OVER & OVER AGAIN WITH THESE MOVIES SMH HAVEN'T WE GROWN FROM THIS 😔😔😔
I saw them filming this at driftwood beach in Georgia when I was visiting!!! So crazy to see the trailer and see the same beach! It’s going to be an amazing movie
Fantasia finally recieving her flowers. Im so excited for her vocals.
Why didn't they just go back to Africa?
Hey wait a sec. I thought they was gonna make this with white people
Why?
OMG I can’t wait!
Looks like s*it, how many moves do they need before we can say that racism is over. It's never enaugh...
Gotta see this one boy-o it’s going to be a great one ☝️
This version looks like it will be fantastic
IMANIAAAA🥺🥺💕💕💕💕💕 That’s my teacher!!
I was the Medic for this production.  Let me just say, I saw the day to day work.  Fantasia will surprise a lot of people.  Fantastic moment for her!
I’m black and I’m not going to lie…I’m exhausted from these types of movies. Can we get different, original movies for black people? We get a slave throwback movie like every other 6 months.
This Color Purple probably be Better than the Original Color Purple
When is this coming out look like this is going to be a good movie
This film is very important because shows how hard had Afroamericans life some years before. Great film and actors and definetly great message👏👏👍
My only disagreement is that it should come out thanksgiving & NOT XMas. That’s stupid .
This remake is strength of self power
Damn you have some balls trying to remake a masterpiece 😮😮😮 good luck, you going to need it.
They’re about to mess up another classic…..is there no more creativity in “Hollywood”? They keep remaking movies….. There are soooo many GREAT books that can be imagined as movies….do those!
why did they remake this movie ?
You told Harpo to beat me I loves harpo lord knows I do
Looks interesting. Looking forward to seeing this one...
I can’t believe I have to wait til December! 😢
I'm excited for H.E.R to start what I know will be an amazing film career. She's already a role model in her music and her fashion, super excited
ion think we live in a good movie era
The black feminists "A Birth of A Nation"
Some movies ya just...  *Leave alone
Uncle Remus ain't sing nuttin' like this, no suh!
Wow, what a cast! This is going to be amazing!
Oh wow 💜
“F*ck this Happy slave bullsh*t, singing dooda.. imma stay in the 90’s where I can tell you kiss my black *ss” - Paul Mooney
If it wasn’t for Fantasia and Halle I’d start a petition to boycott this bs😂
More Remakes 🤦🏾‍♂️
GABI LETS GOOOOOO
Halle's face is weird af lmao
woah
This movie will bomb.. the way black washing is happening.. the world over had enough of seeing there characters replace by black ones.. but.. at least you won't hear a complaint from me.. black film casting black actors.. but the original was sooooo boring.. why they remaking this
My God I can’t wait!! This brought tears to my eyes
Goodness gracious no….
Jennifer Hudson has 24 hours to reply...
Why did this need to be remade? Cant we do something different then a slave era movie or some tyler perry type stuff? I know im gonna get hate on this but c' mon people we got so much more to offer then the same old song and dance.
Raccoons come in my backyard momma just chase ‘em off with a broom
Christmas! I have to wait until Christmas! This gave me chills! <3
Go Phylicia Pearl, i am proud of you to play with Fantasia in the Color Purple. I'm excited to see this movie. In God i trust and everything will be alright😍
Go Phylicia Pearl, i am proud of you to play with Fantasia in the Color Purple. I'm excited to see this movie. In God i trust and everything will be alright😍
Go Phylicia Pearl. I'm proud of you, people in the wold have to know that congolese can make a difference. We trust in God🙏
Hey do you guys think they'll substitute some white people for these black people!? That would be awesome
This remake was not needed, These people are remaking everything for a cash grab
Im crying
im sick of remakes
Nope….
Now this I can get behind...Tarahi P. Henson as Sug Avery ...sold
Black Men = Degenerates... Black Women = Queens of the Universe. Same problems from the original continues on. Oh FBA people are immigrants too... right. Enough is enough. The original was protested by the FBA, even James Baldwin critized the original for a good reason. White male Degeneracy in movies is explained, just like in real life with news outlets. Black male Degeneracy never explained. Be a lesbians already if Black men are that bad. Dont be mad when Beck is in a Black man's bed.
I can't wait to see this movie. I loved the original movie but didn't see the musical.
Taraji fan here. Love to see her in this piece
Can't wait to see this movie. Love Fantasia
YES🙌🏽🙌🏽💕This is going to be EPIC!!!😍 A Classic film with a classic cast of beautiful☀️🌺 hardworking Sisters❤😊
KANGZ N SHIET
Didn’t need to happen.  Could have been a stand alone movie with a fresh title and done immensely better financially.  The only reason they went the direction they did was to cause waves on Social Media.
When something you believed was just a thought in your mind and only a dream, smacks you in the face …. You know you’ve lived wrong and HE prepared others😔  Live Out Loud❣️don’t end up like me.  ASAWRWB ✌🏾
I wish Celia didn’t go through so much pain and trauma
menudo montón de mierda...
People were so worried about Halle playing Ariel... Meanwhile, she snuck an entire movie in without us even knowing! 😂 I love you Halle! ❤
Plz dont mess up this movie it looks good ❤
Picking my jaw up off the floor cause where is their Oscars?!?!
“We are the centre of the universe” 🙌🏾 I cried hard. Israelites assemble….✊🏾👊🏾🙏🏿
Oh I can’t wait to watch this. Made me cry.
Halle is doing THINGS! Can’t wait to see her and Fantasia in the film. ❤
I wish Oprah wasn’t a producer on this. She’s got an iffy track record with projects where she’s  allowed creative control. She WILL bulldoze Spielberg, to her own detriment, just because she’s putting down money. I know half that cast was personally-chosen by her, for a start.
I can’t stop watching this
And...?  H.e.r.😂
This cant be right, it needs a greek actress to headline. Isn't this how its done nowadays thanks to Tina Gharavi & Jada Pinkett Smith
I can't wait!!!! Still one of my all time favorite movies. Went to the play and I'm pumped about this musical❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
OMG! I've got goosebumps! Can't wait <3
Fantasia's voice 😭😭😭😭😭♥️😭♥️😭♥️😭😍😭😭🥰😭🥰 Pure Goooooolllldddd!!!!
ITS Time that world open eyes how Talents Fantasia she is cause world blind fold with some  boring famous Milenial Female Singer's
OMG Y'all, 😊 Will I Have To Learn All Of The Words To  This Newest Color Purple Movie?
That is Bold! Should be good
Already feel like I won’t enjoy this one… the first one was so wholesome and filled with so much I feel like this one will lack a lot of quality content.
This cast is dynamic!! Black excellence all the way !! OMG 😱 I know it’s going to be a beautiful modern version of the classic !! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can’t wait to see this !! One of my favorite movies!! 😍😍😍😍
Wakanda Collab to dc
oh yeaaaaa
Another movie to show the negative image of Black Men that is False. To further keep The Black Man and Woman separated. Add some cool music couple new faces let the indoctrination begin. We’re so much more than this. Now they going after the next generation of young Black Women. If it worked before let’s do it again.
This was the first broadway show i ever saw💜
When will it be in the movies. Can’t wait .
I loved the orginal, and this version looks just good.
Good for Fantasia!
Should have a white or asian or latino to play the lead.......jada would be so pleased......😂😂😂😂
Wow 😢😢😢😢😢
I so here for this. The Talent is overwhelming. Powerful group of women. This is Acting! Encouraging in all the best ways. Wow
Nahhhhh
Nice trailer 👾
Halle bailey goes from being live action ariel at disney to being on the color purple at WB
A movie that was the one of the biggest contributors to the distrust between blq women and men. 4 decades later, we just need to be reminded that blq men are dangerous, untrustworthy, abusive monsters. And to survive them you just need to be strong and independent with your sisters.
Fantasia is maybe the only one they cast right 🤦🏽‍♀️
❤❤❤❤❤
looks abit boring to be honest
Man Jhud and Fan should play sisters. Then it would really rock the house. I'm sure Ariel going to give us baby soul. Lol
Why?? Nobody has original ideas anymore. Everything has to be a remake smh...
Anti- Black man propaganda from feminist
I'm a mess already!!
Leave a Classic alone WTH 🤦‍♀️
Fantasia’s gonna make me cry from her stage performance and screen performance
Dare we say Oscar worthy soundtrack?
Oh this looks SO good. I love how they’re changing things up! It looks like a real winner. If Spielberg wants to keep making musicals, he is MORE than welcome to 😍
Enough of the blacks!!!!
Another bash black men movie. They keep running the same play ,and ya'll keep falling for it.
Finally something original
They just need Jill Scott somewhere in here!!!!! But Taraji yassssss
LITERALLY HERE FOR FANTASIA AND HALLE! Missed me some fantasia!
Trust me I'm not hating and congratulations to everyone cast in this movie BUT I know they didn't Oprah, Oprah, Oprah  baby we need to talk about this Nothing will ever compare to ( you told harpo to beat me) the original
Ready
Definitely I'll watch it.
Wow! This trailer just gave me chills! Can’t wait to see it!🙏🏽❤️
O k miss fantasia
How many movies about the slavery you wanna show the REST of the world where 80% of OTHER people are living USA : YES  🤪🥰🥰🥰
Why I read it as the Colored People 💀
whats the point smh many remakes of black movies but still no reparation checks for them smh
Do we really need another Color Purple movie? For real though!
I am going to be so sad if they've stripped the queerness from this story. Still going to see it, but the book is one of the best love stories of all time.
Casting A1
Glad to see Danielle Brooks in the Movie as well!!!
So tired of the remakes. Noone has an imagination anymore
Looks good!!
This should have been more inclusive by casting Ali Wong as Ceilie
CAN'T WAIT ❤
Why remake one of the greatest films? It will never be as good as the original...NEVER.
Oh my heart, this is going to be good!! && on Christmas Day!!! 🤍🤍🤍🤍
“ They gonna have y’all back in Chainz “  Oprah Probably
Fahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuukkkkkkkkkkkkk  Dis 💩
Halle might just be the new it girl if she keep during movies  like this she have 3 huge filmed coming up
she need to ditch DDG fr fr
I will definitely be seeing this in theatres ❤
Halle Berry looks great!
WHACK
This didn’t need to be remade….
Why Do A Remake That’s So Crazy?
Wow brought tears to my eyes
Yes I will be there!
Sorry, not sorry. It looks over romanticize and way too pretty even for a musical.
Get you passport brothers
Omg fantasiaaaaaaaaaaa !!!!
..til' I seen Fantasia?! 🙌🏾🫡  - Sâ©.
Ceely!!! Fetch me something cold to drink!!!
This is literally the perfect casting. and it’s making me cry
LITERALLY 'We Wuz Kangs' the movie
Not one person should miss. I, for one, have been waiting for it when H.aving E.verything R.evealed announced she was going to be in this H.E.R.story/History making  The Color Purple. I loved the first, I know I will Love this remarkable movie. All the stars ✨ as well as wonderful voices in this musical.  I am looking forward to seeing everyone shine. H.E.R. bring it on shine brilliantly again. 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Wow😂😂😂
I am so excited for this! This is a super cast!
CORNY AF GTFOH MORONS
It doesnt matter if it's a renake or not. I still look at it as part 2 regardless what anyone tells me lol.
Warner bros call yourselves whatever you want make movie about QUEEN SHEBA or the daughter of pharaoh who was like a mother to MOISHE go to the Rabbis ask them for help this movies will change this world including how your black people think,l said your because every shoes have he or her size,yes l meant be black but God did not give my people any land in Israel or any inheritance so l can live anywhere l like means lm not Jewish and every movies you people made about king shlomo 99.9 percent is not true,l can help you with the story of Sheba she got something on her neck that movement the Queen story starts getting more better ask any Rabbi what was that,anyone who knows the answer l we tell him alone why the Big Bang
I need that song like ASAP 😊
Christmas day 2023? Lol, thats on  a Monday. Absolute terrible time to put this movie out.
GET THE FUDGE OUT OF HERE WITH THIS MISCONSTRUED TALE OF RAINBOW AGENDAS….MAKE A Feel good story about the German holocaust…..Right!!! This is propaganda just like the original was…just more evidence media racism….and the industry will be sued for its toxic portrayals of these minstrel show movies.
I can't wait. this is going to be so good.
It would have been better if the role of Halle Balley had been played by a white actress with red hair, to even things out for what she did to the live action The Little Mermaid.
What an amazing cast! 😍
H.E.R. No way on God's green earth is that a name. May as well call her, “Oi, you!”
She was always the mature one, the silent one, i could always see her becoming a Zendaya and her sister taking the much challenging Music Industry.
I'm sooooo looking forward to seeing The Color Purple 💜
They had to re-hash this Anti "Black" man "I don't need a man" movie, eh? Some "woke" people need to go back to sleep....for good!😅
Fantasia baby? This looks good
I love Taraji but Janelle Monae should play Suge and Monique would of gave a great Sophia... They should of let Hailey play the younger version and Taraji the older version of the sister.. I still love the cast very Thankful.
Apparently this is not a remake, it is a remake of the broadway musical version? Making it a remake of a remake. Now I feel like how white people are always complaining about film and cinema being remade and changed. 👺       🤣
Dat gurl can sang!!
I wonder how much black men bashing, and 🏳️‍🌈ness is going to be in this movie?
❤
I can not wait to see this, I herd nothing but great things about the play! 💜
Yes this is what I've been waiting for! 🤎🤎🤎🤎
Eh seems boring
I’m in there like swimwear 😂
I’m really excited for this. The original movie was tough to get through (subject matter), but I think this will be easier to watch. Can’t wait!!
The propaganda assault against the black American community is absolutely relentless.
Omg I used to watch the old version for like 50 times cant wait for the new one to come 😢🔥🔥🔥🔥❤
My FAV movie of all times!!! Love love love! They have my girl Taraji as Shug!?! Yeeeesss! Im so here for this. Bring on ladies!!! 👏🏽🔥💖
Honestly if all the Celie's they'd had in the Broadway show who out did Fantasia? I'll wait?  Not taking anything away from anyone but this is her part. Oprah knows it.
Im here for both fantasia and Halle  ......especially Halle...I hope Halle goes all the way to the top in the film industry because she is a force to be reconed with
is this cleopatra?
ILL PASS
Who wants to watch this Jim Crow film? What self respecting Black person is excited to be retraumatized?
The original Color purple is one of my favorite movies.  I'm excited to see this version.
They made rhis again? The original is timeless im confused its this a remake?
This is not the same thing
I love my people
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE color purple! Used to watch it over and over and over! Can’t wait to watch this😢☺️💕
omg, the tears already falling here!!
Just like with the remake of west side story, nobody asked for this and a new adaptation to what essentially is a great classic film, was not needed and/or necessary.🙄 Ive seen the original Color Purple. I'll pass on this one.
one word...no
Can't wait!  Has this been banned in Florida yet?
Can't wait!!!💜💜💜
I cannot wait to see this!!! It’s one of my favorite books, movie and play! This is going to be incredible❤
I Don't Think The Musical Version Of {THE COLOR PURPLE} Will Do What It Is Expected To Do.. As Someone Who Worked For WARNER BROTHERS.. It' Will Be Sad To See This Musical Adaptation Of {THE COLOR PURPLE} Flop.. I Think The Original Version Of The Movie? Has Left An Extremely Bad Taste In The Mouths Of The Last (THREE) Generations.. Due To The Changing Of The Ideologies Of Relationships Between Men And Women.. Especially African American Men And Women.. However? We Shall See.. 🤔🤔🤔 Yep... Oh, And P.S. .. Thanks For The Residual Check WARNER BROTHERS.. It Just Came Today.. 😁😁😁😁😁 OUT...
The old netty should’ve Jennifer Hudson
Christmas seriously yall?😢
This brought me to tears!!! I’ve always wanted to see the musical and I can’t wait to see this movie. The cast looks phenomenal!! Can’t wait!!!
I didn't even realize that was H.E.R! This cast is amazing and I cannot wait to see this! I'm glad it's in theaters and not straight to streaming. This deserves a big screen!
Black people: we need more movies representing our history Also black people: no one asked for this!   If we don’t like something why can’t we just not watch 😂 I’m confused. Why does everything have to turn into some controversy
I'll pass its going to be like conan the barbarian
I'm ready for this
Omg this gave me chills looks amazing can't to this. Fantasia ❤
I saw Fantasia on Broadway & The CP IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE...AND I read the book!!!! This feels like a gift that keep pn giving!!!!💜💜💜💜💜💜
I love this movie it made me cry & laugh & the beautiful story♥️🙏🏽👠👏🏽🙌🏽🥰
😢😢😢 Fantasia voice tears beautiful send chills through your body.
Nope
I love this movie
Misandry set to music... I'll pass.
Beautiful movie,thanks
This new adaptation looks incredible, Fantasia's voice is all power she's not playing with yall!! Also, I can't help but to think do they kill off Nettie her sister in this version?! Please don't say they do 😩
No just no
Gonna be a Hollywood propaganda filled lgbtq black male bashing  black girl magic 2hour fiesta 😂
This may be the first Black movie that won't make the white Man look bad I have seen..
Ooooo this looks like it could be pretty nice and I love the cast
Yeah sorry this is going to be right there with Wakanda Cleopatra etc
I was originally very skeptical about this since I love the original movie so, so much. But the second I heard Fantasia's voice all doubt went away and the rest of the trailer confirmed the erasure!  That is a once in a lifetime voice and talent that you can't really say about a lot of her counterparts and she is going to kill this roll and this movie looks like a very worthy successor to the original!
WE WUZ KANGZ
Here we go with this BS again...
I can already tell this is going to be amazing and lay so much respect to the source material.
Remake! but with singing.
This movie was created to bash black men.. black man everywhere should boycott this film..
No
I smell garbage already 😂
Why 🤦🏾‍♂️
Monkey
Why does this have so many dislikes? Am I missing behind the scenes information or is it just bias?
Black panther origin’s
❤❤❤❤
The reason Opr@h & other single, lonely 🍑, Auntie/🐶 moms want to bring The Color Purple, back is for 1 specific reason..... To highlight the mythical "Mister 👹 Character" as an excuse to be un-submisive & therefore 👰🏾‍♀️ unmarried in 2023. Eventhough the setting of this 📔 fictional novel was the early 1900's 🤷🏾‍♂️
Can't wait for December!
No. You are not royalty
Trash no one cares
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
The og seems better dosent really show the hard ship in the black community  what they went threw like the orignal this one is more like a musical. One and it will be good but i dont think it will be like the originally   like Spielberg  did for us im gonna stick to the classic  cause its more meaning full
I can't wait.  ITS GOING TO BE 🔥
I MUST see this!
This trailer is just a work of art. Whoever edited it should be very proud. The 2 shots of shug (still and then dancing) followed by the cut to the quincy jones slide is so impactful 1:11  As well as the faster raised hands sequence bouncing from the waterfall to the church then taraji henson slide. 1:48 ❤   Also the bright sunny shot of halle dancing followed by an immediate cut to black ❤❤❤ 1:40
FANTASIA 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾
I can't wait. I'm already crying. Love to Oprah, Steven S., Quincy Q, the whole cast. Much love to my girl, Fantasia. I've been waiting for a long time to see Tasia on the big screen. I'm in tears.
👎🏿
Ya'll be not mess this up.
Nice 👍🏾 clip 🎥🍿….
Wow another black girl magic movie 🙄
Flop
As a Foundational Black American, this is a HARD NO for me. Didnt support the original and won’t be supporting this one. #WeHaveARichCultureHereInAmerica #TheLandThatWeBuilt #DontNeedTheWeTraceBackToAfricaAgenda #StopAntiBlackMenHatred
There you have it folks they have officially ran out of ideas in Hollywood! Just another retread !!
My love and heart can't go out far enough to all the incredible talent on display in this trailer, even the editor popped off. I thought Fantasia would just be a nice treat for fans of Culture but she's actually getting her flowers along with my dark-skinned siblings, especially my sisters we all know seeing ourselves on that screen is usually reserved for those that are lighter-skinned. I was mad they were remaking it til I saw the entire trailer, both movies can exist just like all generations can co-exist within the same world and find beauty and things to appreciate about each other. Ideally anyway. On edge for this release I just can't wait! Excited to be in the theater, even.
This is the most toxic movie in the "black" community. We want to be represented in a different way but we promote this bs movie. Ya'll do you know the power of images, right? This is nothing but images burying into your subconscious that bring trauma to you.
Got goosebumps 🥰😌 cannot wait to watch it❤
Queen of remakes. Gr8.
GONE HEAD MISS HALLE GIRL THIS YO YEAR LITTLE MERMAID ARIEL AND NOW THE COLOR PURPLE IM LOVIN IT SIS AND THE REST OF THE BEAUTIFUL CAST IM LOVIN IT IT SAID XMAS IM THERE!!
I'm all in with this. Great Singers. Great Cast. Let's Goooo!!!!!!! 🎉🎉
It’s a beautiful trailer, will be a beautiful film that we can ALL be just as proud of-I would love to hear what Ms. Alice Walker thinks of it
Whyyyyyyy
All these paid comments😂😂😂😂😂
I can hear Africans right now saying, “No!, we are not the same!” Lol
I can't wait to see this!!
Amazing Cast. Especially seeing Danielle Brooks playing Sofia . It just seems perfect
Imagine being picked to play the ugly woman ?
🙄
Man can we have a movie about us being in 2023...
I have never heard of this film.
GARBAGE!!!! Why, is Steven Spielberg involved with it? Here we go again! Put all the black faces out front when behind the scene the DEVIL is pushing his agenda!!
Honestly, I’m about tired of the black cast needing validation from anybody to remake this movie I’m are we making movies that don’t even make sense the little mermaid, now the  color purple listen to Black people you’re not entitled to me remaking movies doesn’t make a new metal no more better I mean you’re not gonna get a ride with us you’re not never gonna get a Grammy you’re not never gonna get an Oscar for anything because you’re not white OK😂😂😂😂😂😂 and I bet you this movie never gonna get a Oscar or a Grammy. It might get nominated but it’s not gonna go anywhere Oprah make it make sense
I don’t usually like remakes but this looks soooo good! Can’t wait to see it.
They need to re cast one of the Black Chars to a White person.....   That's what they are doing to White chars in movies.
😲😲😲😲😲
I just can’t wait to see this!! Epic🎉
This is about to be an agenda GOLDMINE ❌️🧢
YessssSSSSSS 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 👁❤️💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿
This will be a beautiful moment for all women involved.I was brought to tears just by this short clip. Congratulations on a new venture
I got chills when I sen fantasia
The first movie had all the black women acting like victims I hope that this is not the case with this one... We are going to further pushed in there it is that black men are terrible when it comes to treating black women that is the entire theme of Hollywood men bad women good this is why I don't watch anything in theaters anymore
THERE IS NO FRICKING WAY THEY MADE THIS TO A MOVIE!!! OMGGGGGAWDDDD!!!!!!
Ill pass
The casting looks phenomenal 👀🔥
I have been a fan of Halle and her sister for several years. Their performance of the Star Spangled Banner showcased their skill and talent. If you haven't seen that, you must!! So happy for her!!
Welp I guess they won’t be showing this in Florida
Gimme a break!
Who asked for this
HARD PASS. We need more Black Panther movies and less of our stories as slaves. I’ll stick with the 1985 version. Halle looks beautiful, but she doesn’t look like she ever hand-washed laundry in her life.
nope & who asked for this?
I never seen the movie at all and nor do i plan on itb
Fantasiaaaaa! ❤❤❤ Hope Fantasia gets an Oscar nomination. 😊
Lean movie
I know where I will be on Christmas Day
Yawn.
I'm so excited for this. I never saw the musical on Broadway. Fantasia and Danielle were amazing, from what I saw of small clips of the revival. I hope some people from the original Broadway cast make cameos! ❤
I just watched Oprah, Fantasia, Tarija, watching the trailer and It brought me to tears. I am so excited for Fantasia, she is so deserving! This is her full circle moment!! As soon as tics are available I'm getting a ring side seat!!
RUN FANTASIA HER OSCAR
Next will be roots, which is fine. But studios, seriously stop being lazy and start producing new black stories.
I wouldn’t watch any movie that separates black people on gender lines. The color purple pushed false narratives and was the first time BW were instructed to sleep with BW
More brainwash trash for colored folks to believe in…. I guess black panther wasn’t enough. Don’t watch this trash
Who asked for this?
This movie should be called "He to nice" or "Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good but he make me feel so bad" No one sing that cry me a river song better than Women.
This looks good
The community really doesn’t need this right now… smh
The first scene … like Waow 🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭So proud
Omg I can’t wait to watch it looks good
OOOOOOMMMMGGGGGG!!!! YEEASSSS!!! Please tell me theyre going to sing a bunch of the songs from the musical!!!
Why why 😭 the original is timeless perfect
I can't wait to see this!!!! I LOVE FANTASIA!!! ❤❤❤
Looking so forward to this ❤❤
Next: Schindlers List The Musical
The 1985 film never left my soul and I know this cuz the trailer made me well up and cry. Gotta reread the novel this summer. Never say the musical — I know — and I lived in the city. But this ain’t gon be missed. Can. Not. Wait, Mz Celie!  And Coleman Domingo as Mister! Come thru!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
So my question is why does this not have white men in the lead roles? 😮🤭
WAKANDA FOREVER VIBES🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
We wuz queenz
Why just why? 🤦‍♂️
Hey excuse me Rich producers & directors your people are still oppressed in real time…write a movie about that.
I absolutely hate the color purple they put out an energy that caused a lot of divorces within Aboriginal Niiji aka African Americans community it made the men out to be monsters ISWTFIS 💅🏾
Y am I'm crying from joy
We dont need this but AGAIN but hay lets tear our genda's & people apart even more I see what Hollywoods doing. Question is do you?
A more fitting role for Halle
cant write something new?
I’m crying
Very nice...what about the other colors?
full. body. chills.
Nooo!!!
I'm here for this with all my spirit! HALLE is going so far this young QUEEN!!!!!
Does Spielberg need anymore money
Jonathan Majors should’ve played Mister.
Fantasia voice 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
I hope I get to see this film.
I know this isn’t the remake of the movie but either way, I won’t be to watch it. This was the first movie me and my grandma saw many times together when I was a child. It will literally destroy me 🤦🏾‍♂️.
Agenda crowbarred in in 3-2-1…..👀
Maybe the academy will be just with this version since they absolutely screwed up with the first version.
Naw, that ain't it.
Good to see another friend of Harvey Weinstein( Oprah ) still gets work in Hollywood just like his assistant is now making star wars movies . #metoo but only for certain people
We wuz kangz
I have never hated something so much in my life
🇬🇭
I taught we were done with all this
Whats up with these idiotic comments? im seeing allot of "Woke" and "slavery", this movie isnt about slavery and im struggling to see how this is woke? they really hate us.
Please please for the love of God no!!! The movie already exists you money hungry bastards!!!!
Why didn’t they just name it something else
kevin samuel turning in his grave
Liking this
Where Is Ciara ? Why She Not In The Trailer 🤔👀👀👀
Now this is what I call a movie 💪🏾
Not me over here crying 🥹 I love this so much
Not watching this 😑
I still remember Fantasia singing I’m Here at the Tonys back in the early 2000s. She was incredible then…it’s gonna be next level now.
I LOVE BLACK COLOR WHEN IT IS IN PERSON🖤☺️
The way my heart jumped when I seen fantasia . Man I love her so much
Epic artistry cultivated in this flim 🎬.... looks like it's destined to be a classic ✌🏿🤟🏿👏🏿✨️
Liberal blacks, love making these slave movies about Black people being treated like second-class citizens. Disgusting.
Always loved this movie since my childhood😢😢❤
black people making films with black people for the black people.
Why can't Christmas be tomorrow????😢 ❤
I can't wait to see this I love me some Fantasia❤❤
Another one ! Jesus they love beating a dead horse. My only question is if africa is so great then why dont they go there move there go back there ??????? Anything..... Jesus enough already nobody cares anymore.we all have problems.... Got people on here already a runnin there mouths oh before you start this aint same movie,,, nobody cares america has its on problems were not concerned about africa. Trust me
Idk 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Stupid movie
The fact some people thought this was the little mermaid..
Some things are better left untouched.
All I know is that Mr better still go fed in this movie. Don't water him down.
How tf will this movie ever work in such an entitled and sensitive generation
I'm conflicted. Film looks REALLY well made. But history has shown original film to be yet another hit piece on black men. Didn't notice as a child, but as I got older my eyes have been opened. Love the cast tho
Why does every single movie from the early 90s to mid 2000s need a remake.
MAN....WHAT????
Is it in 3D?. I always believed period piece movies should be in 3D.  Also, where's The Flash promised 3D screenings.
All I wanted from this trailer was “You sholl is ugly” 😂
Looks fantastic ❤
"You shoo is uglyyy!"
They just needed to leave it original alone. The original was great on its own. Unless there's a continuation of the story that needs to be told.
This looks amazing, I am excited for this movie 💜💜💜💜💜
Hallie in two movies mane she finna be getting bank
Definitely want to see this. Glad they didn’t remake the one with Oprah because that movie was too sad. Looking forward to this one.
Sheeeiiiit
Purple Rain is better
Such a classic. It always makes me cry. This looks amazing.
This looks pretty great!
This looks amazing! 😊
Stop remaking and come up with something new
Interesting and cool trailer and vid.
I’m Here For H.E.R. 😊
Seeing Fantasia gives me proud mom feels! Ive been a fan since day one on Idol and I've followed her every since. Can't wait to see her and some of the others get that Golden Globe recognition!
I’ll still watch it
We was kangs
I had the opportunity to see the play for a few years ago with Fantasia. From what I understand it is not like the movie but the book.
Halle eyes is to close to her ears
Pale people stay mad. How can one be so angry about a movie?! 😂🤦🏾‍♀️ I'm telling you, it's in their DNA.
So nobody tired of them feeding us this slavery trauma based entertainment. They give every generation the same programming and keep us in the same mindsets and bound. Like what's the purpose of them bringing this movie back after all this time ????????
❤️‍🔥
💜
Let's remake it! Using all white people.
Yeah, i can't wait for all the MEDIA and HOLLYWIERD screaming  "THIS IS THE FIRTS BLACK CAST IN HISTORY" But don't mind this 12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013) ANTWONE FISHER (2002) BARBERSHOP (2002) RAY (2004) HUSTLE & FLOW (2005) DREAMGIRLS (2006) THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG (2009) 42 (2013) GET ON UP (2014) SELMA (2014) CHI-RAQ (2015) HIDDEN FIGURES (2016)  should I go on?
this new version and the original are two completely different movies. both can co-exist without diminishing the other. i think this movie will be amazing
Who asked for this?
Hollywood running out of ideas
Imagine all the actors white. That’s how everyone feels about Spider-Man, the little mermaid, tinker bell, hunger games, etc..
lol wtf.
I was lucky enough to see the Broadway production of The Color Purple in NYC starring Fantasia years ago. My Mom and I were in tears during Fantasia's solos. This is going to be great!!!
OMG I cant wait this is going to be sooooo good
Well it fits all the criteria... it looks like Warner Brothers is trying to get a best picture win for the Oscars.
Let's be real. Black people don't do anything
WE WUZ KANGZ!!!
WHEWW
My top 10 favorite movie of all time. I will be watching.
Naw leave the classic along
@kimberlynicolefoster89 Did we need this adaptation before a Shirley Chisholm biopic???
Fantasia is about to carry!!!!
Fantasia cuz I’m proud of you ❤
No, not interested.  Whoopi Goldberg did it the best in the 80s.  Undoubtedly one of the best films ever made.  This looks like a cheap money grabbing remake.  EDIT:  It's the overall same plot to the film from 1985.  A different breed of dog is still a dog.
I just want someone to allow Fantasia to sing the intro song to a 007 movie
I feel like i have seen the entire movie
Where’s the diversity? Why isn’t there Asian, Hispanic disabled lesbians in this?
Imagine Egyptians making this movie
omggg halle
Where's the white girl with red hair at? Oh wait...wrong film. Okay, now this makes more sense unlike that other film with a mermaid that doesn't look like Ariel. *Also China Poster Ads have her blue like Avatar...and yet we Americnas who oppose such a film are the problem.
Here comes another the black man is the problem and he is toxic. "We dont need no man"
- Hollywood, just make another slave movie or an exorcism movie that takes place in a predominantly black community,
isso tá lindo
Ándale, esta si es tu familia
Waiting this moment ❤️
Don't waste the first version was dissapointing hatedi it
With the whole cleopatra BS going on.. lets do a remake of color purple and use Martha Stewart instead of Oprah 😂
As long as Danny Glover is playing Mr. I am in!
Oprah’s name before Jones and Spielberg. Makes sense 🙄
WOW, just wow!
I got emotional when I saw fantasia 🥺🥺🥺
HARD MF PASS I KNOW THE ORIGINAL LIKE I KNOW FRIDAY OTS ITS A NO FOR ME
Taraji let's go
I’ll be taking mom to see this! She loves that movie and somehow always finds the perfect quote from it for any situation😂this looks like it could be pretty good
Yes come on Halle
"We are more than kings and queens. We're at the center of the universe." That sounds more than a little ethnocentric and arrogant. If this was a movie with an all white cast, it would be rejected as promoting racial superiority. And yet this same standard is never applied in the opposite direction. Hmmmmm.....
is there anything coming out that isn't racial? talk about annoying af. Like, we get it, you're black. Big whoop
🌹🌹🌹🌹🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿❤️🖤💚
WE WUZ KANGZ N SHIEEEET
Usually don't like musicals but I love the movie color purple and I definitely want to see this.
I can't wait to see this movie 😍
I would love to see Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson remake this.
I feel like Cynthia Erivo should have gotten a role in this... her brief performance in "A Tribute to Prince from the cast of The Color Purple" blew me away - no small feat for someone sharing the stage with Jennifer Hudson.
Cant wait
Can’t wait!!
Fantasia deserves the world
shouldve race swapped everybody...i mean thats just the thing to do these days
This movie won’t have the stellar cast that the original did
I pray that this opens the doors of super stardom for Fantasia. She deserves it, she's worked so hard and I want the best for her
This CAST...AMAZING!!
Очередной фильм повестка((
Woke is broke😂
They should’ve keep this where it was at every thing don’t need a remake make a original film
Hollywood running out of ideas
Can’t wait for Christmas. Why so far out? I got goosebumps. Can’t wait to see it.
Kinda wish they had included Whoopie in some way
FANTASIA- Please come and get your OSCAR !!!! right now..
Is 2023 and we have millionaires and billionaires of color in the world. Keep playing is like we don’t exist we’re so blind it cause we won’t take off our blinders. We have so much power but we won’t use it that’s all we make over 2000 comments about nothing, but that shows you how much power we have if we have over 2000 comments we need to put these into action, so we can have commercials advertisement, movies, sitcom’s showcasing people of color we exist. Why do we hide others want to be as imitate us better than our own selves, less left our voices and matter in the world, instead of taking what they’re so caught giving us.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤
Wow this movie made me and my sisters hug each other longer and more often. I love the original
💛🐆I can't wait to see this. The Color Purple was one of my favorite movies and books as a child. What a Blessing's to see such as a new rendition and allstar cast. Kudos for good entertainment!🐆💛
They put all black actresses and actors in one movie, because the movie industry does not want to see people of color on the screen consistently we can appraise one movie he brings out the worst instead of bringing out the best in earth. As people of color, we have to fight for movies for commercials for comedy, for people of color the only time we had commercials of people of color was my soul train was out, the only time we see magazines with people of color was Ebony jet, and all these things are going so our history is wiped away a little at a time , and then a sprinkle less tiny little specs anyhow, up with the color purple are you kidding me open your eyes people
🟫🟫👁🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫👁🟫🟫 🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫👃🏾🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫🟫             🟫🟫🟫🟫👄🟫🟫🟫🟫
I love fantasia, so i just might have to go and see this, and the casting choice is respectable, fantasia and taraji have a broadway background
I remember the first movie my boyfriend at that time refuses to go to the movie so l got the book and read it. Well best l could in 1985 in Georgia, the boyfriend who refuses to marry me because my skin was too black and he was jet black to, but he did marry a woman who had 4 kids not his and look white, anyways l got marry had two sons life never been happy for me until lmhad my two boys age 26 and 28. Just wish l wasn't so stupid and slow and hard of learning born 1963,
they should have made her white
Awww. ❤
Pass…
Fantasia singing I’m here gave me shivers
Looks good!
Why !!!!!!!Why!!!!!!!Why.....Danm.😢😢😢😢
Black Girl Magic!
More purple just what we need
They should go WOKE and make everyone white
I wish they never called this the color purple because they totally just screwed that up. The original was a completely different movie from WHATEVER THIS IS they should’ve just called it something else
This isn't going to do well.  The well of white guilt has dried up.  No one cares, especially the blacks
OMGGGG, OPRAH WINFREY, STEVEN, QUINCY, HALLE, TARAJI... Speechless!!!
Favorite movie of all times, love Alice Walker, seen the play, read the book many times.  I am over the moon for a new take on the story.  Cast looks AMAZING, music will be thrilling.  I will be at opening night!
Looks like a horror story
More propaganda.! To make black men look bad.! 👿👿👿
The original cast is still around. How about we make a rule? There shall be no remakes of movies while the original cast is still alive.
This is the first time I've seen anything from the musical, I don't know what it's about but the voice of Fantasia Barrino, which is so beautiful, the lyrics of the song, the cinematography so great, and seeing that the past is to be forgotten, made me cry, never I had cried over a trailer  i'm so excited to see this
Oh god please don't ruin it with to much wokeness
You know what? Yes. This looks phenomenal.
I admit, I questioned the casting when I heard about it.  this trailer looks phenomenal.  that said, they need to get off that only in theaters mess. give it the debut and stream it a month or so after
Rest in Peace the Godfather Kevin Samuels
This may be the only thing to make me stop hating Danny Glover…I’ve been hating that poor man since 1990 😂
From what I see so far with the trailer if I should rate this movie from a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 10 it’s going to be real real good please get ready to go see the color purple it’s gonna be that good
Inhad no idea Halle Bailey was a legit actress lol.
Saw Oprah is producing. Won’t see it.
I cannot wait to see this movie, the color purple I have seen the original. I loved it and I love this trailer  Fantasia. And all the cash of this movie beautiful, beautiful great job I cannot wait to go see it ladies you deserve to play this role congratulation
Woke trash.
Nothing beats the original
omg es N como yo 😮
I love how they added the Adowa dance ❤🇬🇭
Halle Bailey 😍😍😍😍😍
Can't wait!
Fantasia is such amazing singer. Like, really, she sings that fantastically. And already this movie is amazing. All of the warmth, and all the joy and all the triumph is all there in this film. I can't wait for this epic journey of the new take of this beloved classic.
Wondering why there was no raceswapping? Oh, that only goes one way😂
Que lindo isso 😍😍😍😍
this is going to further the problems that black women have on finding a man
I'll watch it to support my people but NOTHING CAN TOP THE ORIGINAL!
Uh-oh. This won’t play in Florida because it makes white folks feel bad.
Steven Spielberg having his annual Oscar bait movie coming out near Christmas.
Is Hollywood out of us Dead!? Why don’t they make something new instead of reruns
man, I did not expect this musical, of all things, to become a movie. I think it's got a ton of potential, and I'm just glad we're getting another musical movie this year.
That's definitely not purple 🤣
Nice
Excited for this!!!!!
HOLLYWOOD..NOW..YOU KEPT ONE QUEEN(BASSETT) FROM GETTING HER RIGHTFUL OSCAR....THIS MOVIE HAS A GREAT CHANCE TO WINS LOT OF MAJOR GOLD THIS AWARD SEASON
Hollywood is creatively bankrupt.
Tears. Tears. Tears. 🤧
the color grade is fabulous
Spielberg and Winfrey can’t come up with original content anymore?
I smell Oscar nominations, can't wait to watch it.... long over due and casting is awesome! I got   goosebumps watching the trailer 💯
Same oh same oh. Just with different actors. How much longer is Oprah going to milk this title?
Casual movie enjoyers when they see a movie with black people in it: 😡😡😡
I cant wait omg
Another WOKE film
Black people hamlet
Yawn!!!!
Yassssssssssss gawddddd
I hate yall for this...who wanted this? Please white movie executives stop trying to remake these horrid movies
💜💜💜
Steven Speilburg is a joke, and his movies have become a disgusting woke travesty. Go woke, go broke!
Great another black struggle/supremacy movie
im just so happy for halle and on top of that fantasia and h.e.r wow. And dont get me started on taraji my fav actor and i think quincy fine self in here too
finally i'm so proud
Can wait to see it ❤ congratulations
Fantasia over there, having her little star moment
True story.  My mother had me watch the original movie years ago (30+). I thought the movie was named as such because whoopies gums color.  I was a young teen and I thought that’s why it was named that.
Gotta love Fantasia.
I’m just here to give it a thumbs down. SYSBM
I think its for me 😮
Catwomen ask Robin how u feeling Robin he says PURRRFCt Robin now is CATBOY.....HOT!!!!
Oh hey look it’s the little mermaid 2 wade in the water.
So excited for this!!!
Damn this cleopatra film looks different
I need to see this❣️♥️😊😭🎉🎉🤣
Great Casting, looking forward to seeing this update.
This brought me to tears just seeing this. I can’t wait to see it on the big screen. This cast isn’t going to deliver nothing short of amazing. This is going to be epic. Tasia girl it’s your time love. I could feel all the emotions in each note sang.
The original is one of my favorite top 3 movies of all time.  Personally I’m looking forward to listening to the music from this adaptation.
This made me emotional ❤️😭
Yassssssss hunni!! Baaayybay, when Tasia voice came in, I was captivated, this lil trailer done made me smile from ear to ear with tears in my eyes, I'm sooooo ready! And yes, I will be sangin in the audience, so deal wit it!
Lol why though?
Fantasia is making us North Carolinians so proud once again 🥹🫶🏾
I wish George Floyd could have lived to see this
You can’t beat Whoopi … or Oprah.
Excited about this
This looks amazing I might have to check it out👍🏾❤️🔥
Not one white person 🧐
Looks really good ❤️✊🏽🌹
I'll always, always for the rest of my life feel very proud that my mother was a black woman, I've always felt identified with them and their music is wonderful. I can't wait to watch this masterpiece in theaters! 🥹💛🙏🏻🤩👌🏻
...and Fantasia always kills it... sweet❤😊
Ghana 🇬🇭 to the whole world/'wiase'!!! In case ya'll don't know, this movie was directed by Ghana's own Blitz Bazawule (Blitz the Ambassador)... MADINA BOY wa te!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Yes Jesus !!!
The movie is my favourite!!! Please tell me this doesn't destroy the original??? ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wish one day all african americans could return to Africa were they will become kings and queens.
FANTASIA ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ YES MA’AM SHINE!!!!!
My favorite movie of all time
FANTASIA?? OMG !!!!!
To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
mayhaps chloe should do musicals too
They should have casted white people for all the black roles since they like to blackwash everything now!
Good movie
"The Color Purple" is a true masterpiece in the making! This trailer has left me speechless and captivated by its powerful storytelling. The all-star cast, led by the incredible Taraji P. Henson, Danielle Brooks, and Colman Domingo, brings Alice Walker's beloved classic to life with such grace and authenticity. Kudos to director Blitz Bazawule for his bold vision and the remarkable team behind the scenes who have poured their hearts into this production. I'm eagerly counting down the days until December 25th when I can experience the unbreakable bond of sisterhood and immerse myself in this reimagined world. Bravo, Warner Bros. Pictures, for bringing us this extraordinary film!
Crazy that they named the movie after black dudes purple dicks 😂
Is that…. Ghana???
Not enough diversity in this film.  It’s a no for me, Ha!
Wow I can't wait to see this!
Couldn't come up with something NEW?
I thought when they mentioned the word bold they were talking about the leading roles going to non blacks actors?
So now it's ok to have no diversity in casting?
If it's not a remake then give it a new name and stop remaking every movie and start getting original
When this fails who they gonna blame ?
First move was propaganda and second just looks dumb. Far from being African more like a wanna be Victorian women from a sick society lol and the sad part is that this will go over most heads.
They'll have a hard time matching up to Oprah and Whoopi from the original film, but I hope they do.
I don't care whether its a remake or a musical. I remember how much the color purple has always been one of my favorite books of all time❤
I think Coleman is a great casting choice... You love to hate him on Fear The Walking Dead..
My heart is not ready! 😭 I love how this isn't a remake either, but a movie version of the musical. I love how they did that with Matilda too. I can't wait to see this!
Looks like an appeasement
Warner Bros please do better. Shed light on something different. Who asked for this ? definitely not people of color. Same old interpretation of black people its sickening.
Not Another Black Struggle Movie
Oh I can't wait
"we are royalty" not "we ... royalty"
Can we stop idolizing Africa in media? Like y’all ain’t ever been to the state next to you and idolizing a place over 500 miles away with a completely different culture and way of life.
I need this song
Let’s destroy the movies created
Bold new take? Bullashitta.
Why?
Salute to the black cast
I don't comment...but this deserves it. Made me shed tears.... beautiful.... beautiful
She acts too much better here than the little mermaid
So they really wuz Kangz.
Harpo is going to get his behind whipped again.
A great movie with amazing actors
I cnt wait to see this lady cut up as Sug Y'all know she gon sho out
Not yet released in Brazil
Oh wow this cast, I AM SEATED!  The Color Purple was one of the first (non YA) novels I read when I was younger that has made a lasting impression on me. Boy was younger me blindsided. I was certainly not prepared for the traumatic things I would be subjected to reading and the way Celie so innocently narrates it. 🥹 When I learn that there was a movie adaptation (the original), I was elated. And now a remake with some of my favorite actors! I will definitely be watching!
I'm not interested. More black men bashing, more strong black women  talk, more black victimhood, and lesbianism between black women. There is nothing uplifting about the Color Purple or any positive black heterosexual relationships. Oprah never is behind anything uplifting to black people especially black men. If it ain't self degrading, she's not behind it. If was a positive representation of blacks, Hollywood wouldn't back it or will try their damnest to kill it like they did with The Banker or Nate Parker's Birth of A Nation. It looks like pretty garbage that a bunch of black women will support. But trying to explain to black women when the powers that be is making fun of them goes in one ear and out the other.
I thought they were going to get creative and swap the characters out for white ones. Not much diversity in this film I won't be watching.
Already crying. This is going to be so good!!!😊😊
Ten seconds in: WE WUZ KWEENS
Almost made me cry 🥹
The Color Purple...Classic! *#WhoopiGoldberg*
BLOCKED
I've already watched this so many times it's unhealthy
And here it is I thought we weren't going to be getting any more films negatively depicting Black men/boys via an ahistorical lens.
so happy for fantasia 💜💜
WE WUZ COLOURS AND SHIEEEE
Why ? Just.....why ?
Another Halle movie ❤
A movie no one wanted
My baby H.E.R. !!!! ❤🔥
This looks amazing, I cannot wait to see it! :D
Just a curse on this earth.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Muito lindo😍😍
The original movie pushed a divisive yet truthful narrative. The question should be why are these narratives, “disunity” constantly being pushed?  Why can’t we value truthful positive black movies? Always, suffer suffer suffer & despair like that’s our collective reality as a people.  Celie still gon tell hapo to beat Sofia & the dudes in that jook joint still wanna drank Suge Avery’s dirty cooda water 😂  This movie is to much man
Hollywood didn't Race Swap/Gender Swap them? They should be portrayed by young white boys. Just another Remake that nobody asked for.
Give me my ticket, and give it to me NOW!
Absolutely love Fantasia 💜
Y'all - just verifying- we are all wearing our proudest purple to go see this, right?
This seems like a long time to wait !
WE WUZ COLORS N SHHEI-
Next Big Visual Treat after "The Greatest Showman"...
I have been waiting for Danielle Brooks to breakout again. Apart from Broadway, they've been sleeping on her ever since OITNB.
1:55 finally H.E.R without glassess on ❤️❤️
Can't wait 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Stares Kevin Samuelsly 🤦🏿‍♂️
They should have swapped the main characters and had white actors and actresses play them. I keep being told theres nothing wrong with when they do that with black actors and actresees 😎
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Should have cast Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role
I didnt know Taraji coul sing, looking forward to this.
Looks amazing! Really loved the classic film but this looks like a good new take on the story!
Seriously what is wrong with hollywood, haven't we suffered enough.
Boy I’m so ready for this movie, most of the views on this video is because of me. 😂
Is it that we can’t or we won’t move on from this? How many remakes are we supposed to tolerate? Please let the next Planet of the Apes be the last one…
I's thought we were done with Massa type acting.
FYI: this is NOT a remake of the original movie, it is an adaptation of the broadway musical. the musical is much more closer to the book than the original movie. the musical and the 1985 film are vastly different so there is nothing to worry about. this movie will be its own thing. yes!
wtf?? Unnecessary. Not needed. No imagination in hollyweird
Another failure of a remake. Lol Hollywood is trash. They create nothing new. and the when there is actually a good film to watch it’s mostly cgi. Sadly Hollywood doesn’t know how to make interesting movies anymore
There has literally not been a white movie made in 5 years… barring Super Mario Brothers
I think I speak for all the brothers in here when I say…THIS AGAIN?!! 😂…enjoy my sisters.
honestly i dont like the colour purple, i stopped liking it back in 2014, and im definitely gonna hate it more later this year
looks pretty good, awesome cast, halle killing it again, so happy for her, two huge projects , she is so amazing
In the 80s original, the women kissed. In this modern version, they may be using strap-ons...
Release the godzilla x kong trailer 😁
Boring ! Another pushed black agenda
LEAVE IT ALONE 🙄
Here I was thinking this would be an all-white remake
FANTASIA!!!!!!!!!!! BETTER SINNNNGGG!!!!!!!!!!! ANNNNDDDD I:M HEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEE YEEEEEEAAAAAHAAAAH AH AHHHA AHAHH YAAAAH AYYAHA YHAAH HAHA . The new golden glob winner watch.
Star-studded.  PRIDE!   BRAVO!!!
no thanks!
Not even gonna lie this looks pretty good
Halle is having a breakout year good for her!
*MAG-NI-FICENT😍*
Please stop, PLEASE 🙏! All of you are just ruining my childhood! Make you own original movies and shows, it’s not that difficult!!!
🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
I saw Fantasia perform this role on Broadyway. Not a bootleg on YT. I was in the 6th row. CHILLS! Even if she doesn't sing, trust that she can play this role!
Yeeeeeeeees! I’m in there
This movie had me doing"The Ugly" cry. God blessings are on this movie. I truly can't wait. May God continue to bless Ms Oprah W. "Wisdom teacher" and all 😅
Black larping is like white larping. Whites do knights and dragons. Blacks romanticize slavery and Jim Crow.
AWWWWW SHIIIIIET
I love me some Fantasia... this is going to be good.
Wow!!!
А почему нет ни одного белого лица? Это харассмент какой-то?
I can't wait to see it! Always been a fan of the color purple so I am very excited to watch this version. It looks like it going to be hit!!
Since they change white characters to black, all of these characters should be played by white people.
Let's make this a big time  box office hit
Fantasia!!!!  Omg I can’t wait !!!
Remake of the movie that started the incessant hatred of Black men. Let’s see how deep this one goes to further promulgate hatred towards the Black Man in America.
another movie ruined. nice
Chills
Why wasn't this movie race swapped?
Looks amazing
Cool
The girlies are HAPPY 😭😍 Fantasia, Taraji AND Halle?! I'm there🤝🏾
what's with the dislike bombing?
about to have an all-time musical adaptation love they cast actors from the broadway show
This film has done more damage to the Black community than Crack cocaine. When will we learn that we are being programmed to destroy each other.
We are at the center of the Universe and it's called Melanin.  It is in all things.   This looks really good.  On the watch list!
Good ol purple big gal in 4K! Nice. 👍
Fantasia getting her Oscar finally
Wow! I never thought a remake should be done of this classic movie, but this literally just gave me chills and the tears are flowing! I can’t wait to see this with my family opening weekend! 👏🏽❤
This is a lovely adaption of the Broadway play. It’s no movie remake the movie is from a book. Not a exact adaptation
Strand is literally the worst for turning a town into a slave town. #fearTWD 😂
is this a musical.
Дядя Бэтмен когда распад диснею они банкроты и банят Марвелы Шанг Чи за четверть часа Бэтмен должен покупать Марвела джедаев и пиксару и все
The original is my favorite all time movie.  I’m glad this is coming to a new generation but worry about how it could compare to the original masterpiece.
Yo Blitz. Keep wining. Been following since day one. Keep Walking.
Is that cookie ???😮
Fantasia! Goose bumps!
I was thinking wow the visuals here look great, looked up the cinematographer, and its Dan Lausten, who does most Guillermo Del Toro films and the John Wick movies besides the first. Which immediately explained why it looks so good. I liked the Spielberg movie a lot but I'm not a fan of musicals so 🤷‍♂️
Hollywood only making REMAKES REMAKES REMAKES iam tried of REMAKES make something new
This is dumb
Beautiful 💜💜
God why
This trash 🗑️
❤
Just what we need another BLM movie.
Black History ❤
Not my type of movie but y’all go crazy❤
I love this book so much, and I am already tearing up at this trailer!  What an amazing group of talent - I can't wait!
This is going to be EPIC!!! 💜
Certainly going to be an Oscar Award Winning Film
Taraji and Danielle are PERFECT for their roles lol
Beautifully shot. Looks great
Boy, they're REALLY playing down the fact that it's not just a movie with music, but a musical.
Can’t wait to see this!
fantasia, hope she soars in this...music industry has been determined to do her wrong
😒 another slave movie
Wow, this trailer put me in tears.  I wanna see it.
AND I CAN'T WAIT‼️❤️💙🧡💛💚💜🤎👏🙌🥰
Why she have a massive head.
This is about to be a classic
Fantasia can sang but acting, IDK. This is a cast of excellent Black actors. I hope the movie does AH-MAZING. ❤
Why couldn’t they have cast the starring role with a white actress? White Lives Matter! Racists!
They bout to eat this movie up omg
NNNNNOOOOOOO!!!! Why Oprah WHHHYYYYY!!! Leave well alone DAMN!! But I’m going to have to watch it because my homie Tasia she’s a personal friend of mine that’s the only reason why I’m watching…
Time to Halle Bailey my goals!!!!!!!
H.E.R looks like a 14 year old her
Taraji is miscast as Shug. Shug got talent. Shug can sing.
Love it. Halle is working.
Chick Flick. Yuck
Where is CIARA ????
I hope this movie is a better more beneficial portrayal than the movie. Kevin Samuel's would be rolling over in his grave right now if it's just more of the same.
Movies like this deserve an Oscar,but for whatever reason they always over look it.
Halle Bailey lol out here playing chess...this is what i call a silent killer in this game.
Omg! Phenomenal cast. I’m super excited to watch this movie. I haven’t been this excited about a movie since Hustlers bc my next door neighbor was JLo’s character lol.
And I hear she got that nasty woman disease….. Caesar the great, RIP
Yayyyyy
What is the title od the soundtrack?
“It’s gon’ rain on yo’ head!”
This is amazing
Wow this amazing actually 😍
I saw the braodqay zhow when i was younger and what made it special for me was just how intimate and persnalvthe story being told was. At lease with the tone of this trailer, this certainly does not feel like a movie about a struggling slave who finds her own independence and self worth. This looks like its trying to the hreatest showman with how bombastic this trailer is. Idk hoping to be proven wring
Oh this is gonna make me cry. I just know it.
Why this in my recommendation? That's not what I pay for the Internet.
Now THIS looks amazing!,
I watched the movie I cried . I read the book I cried. This remake better make  me cry.
Who else is ready to see Fantasia shine?!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 you all or this world is so sad now
I wonder if they'll make white people look bad in this movie . Ohhh of course they will ! It's the new normal .
LOL at alll the whining.
ALL MY LIFE I HAD TO FIGHT!
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽Sorry, but this won't work. Maybe if they had gotten anyone else but Fantasia. Out of anyone they could of gotten, they chose her, that's going to be their downfall big time.
So i know im risking my black card by saying this but ive never seen the color purple and im 34😂. I always avoided it because it looks boring and sad 😅… but watching this trailer makes me feel like the version will be entertaining and maybe ill see the original at a different point…
Criminal Americans.
Awesome! I cannot wait to see this!! ❤❤❤
I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So excited to see this 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 this December
I got tears coming down my face. The power in this trailer is undeniable. Woohoo chile!! Come thru cast ❤️✔️
whats song?????
Quick somebody grab Elizabeth Banks and tell her Spielberg has a women in a film.
This looks fantastic.
This is great.  Excited to see all the stars, including Fantasia and my girl Halle
Putting that African title on all Black Folks smh
W
we wuz royalty and shieeet
Goosebumps 💜
I would check it out when it comes out in theaters. Amen.
Halle’s really showing us she’s not a one-trick pony. She’s not just a disney princess (which she embodies perfectly). C’mon actress! Can’t wait to see this. So in love with the entire cast
❤
Not seeing any white actors for some reason
I love the book so much. As a black teenager growing up in the 1990’s it opened me up the a world of black literature. A remake in 2023 is so important at time when we have libraries banning books like the color purple that tell an important view on the black experience.
My aunt was soo looking forward to Fantasia as Celie again. I was really feeling the newer broadway cast of Cynthia Erivo as Celie, Danielle Brooks as Sophia, and Jennifer Hudson/Heather Headley as Shug. Buuut that being said, Fantasia has the chops for Celie perfectly and I’m not complaining. I’m excited af for this movie! Great cast!
The original is a classic and one that is unmatched. Somethings shouldn’t be touch!
Beautiful ❤️🌹...just beautiful 😍🎉
So excited for this movie musical! So excited to see so many black women shine and show off their talents. Halle gets to flex her skills in a totally different role. Fantasia is still praised till this day for her broadway performance of this. Danielle Brooks is a major talent. I hope this results in many awards/nominations. I can confidently say every person cast, down to Colman Domingo, is talented. They’re some of the most talented people in the industry having seen most of their work. Hope they get the love and attention they deserve for this!
Why?
Seems really nice, but why end by saying "We are more than just kings and queens, we're at the center of the universe" ? This unecessary centerism isn't gonna help people from all races to live together. Why do we let some people use the LEGIT fight of AfricanAmericans for recognition, dignity and aknowledgement to push a narrative is such a strange centered, racially-chauvinistic way ? It is certainly distinct/beyond LEGIT empowerment. Coould we mind keeping our discernment ?
Omg can y’all stop?! No kinda originality!!!! Whether it’s an extension of the original or a full blown remake doesn’t matter….all we are getting is recycled material. No kinda originality in todays society 🙄🙄🙄🤦🏿‍♀️
Christmas!!!!??? I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.
hope this movie gets atleast 1 USD IN AFRICAN CONTINENT
I love that we are keeping these stories alive. That generations to come will see us in all our pain and glory but presented in a beautiful way.
Nice
This story is completely fake
One of my all time favorite movies. And yes I will je watching this one 🖤🖤🖤💜💜💜💜
Thst song was terrible....clearly not Balley
Another bleeding heart film from Spielburg.  (Like Swindler's List.  Where his stated purpose is to make all us Gentiles to feel guilty.)  I started watching this "Color Purple" movie, but had to stop after the first 15 minutes.
Fantasia 🫡
Hallie Bailey is doing her thing. Landing top roles. Go ahead Sista. I’m proud of you.
Fantasia? SAY LESS! so great to see her singing ON the big screen. Kudos to the production company and cast looks like a great movie
One Of The Great Spielberg Movies
Is Celie gonna say it feels like he using the bathroom on me again?
Nothing original anymore one remake after another. There are some movies that should remain untouched this is the one
Yayyyyyy another remake😑
😳
Damn Fantasia gets me every time! My God, her voice gives me chills and makes me cry. Wow, can't wait to see this!
As an Asante 💛🖤💚 I feel super proud. Thank You WARNER BROTHERS. 🎉💃🏾🔥🔥
There was no need to remake this anti blk male feminist BS !!! The divided and conquer is real.
Really y'all remake color purple
They could've kept that
Can't Wait!!!! The cast is perfect!!❤❤❤❤
Whoever is responsible for the casting, BRAVO!! I am SO here for this!!
Always hated  musicals
Nossa 😢❤
Look.. i love color the purple… im going to see it! #lesswassaid😂
This gave me chills. I am a massive fan of the film. I absolutely can't wait to see this.
Hope its not about lesbianism only.
Halle bailey is in her bag
This is gonna be legendary. Period.
Can't believe they still make this in 2023 no way no how and they wonder why they make no progress still stuck back in the day huh?
Crossing the line come up with something new
Not a fan of wide mouth fantasia , but I do love the color purple book and movies ,so I'll give it a try. She just be screaming singing annoying 🙄
Unbelievable already got the goosebumps ❤
No worries with this all star cast; it’s going to be a great addition to our collection of epic films 🎥
I cannot wait to see this movie Fantasia and her voice she's going to kill it
and Fantasia Barrino 😊🎉
Look how far Fantasia has come!!!
Sorry like the way this girl has been shoved down everyone's throats and she's nit eveb that pretty.
Well i for one think this looks really good. Haily is really going shine this year, the rest of the cast looks stellar as well.
Well another remake 😮
Genuinely surprised the cast isn't white considering the rampant race bending in the industry
The first Color Purple damn near destroyed Black American. Now they have the nerve to remake that bullsht?   We are so doomed....
Wow, totally speechless!
Oh just because black people like grape drink you call the movie purple,
Now this looks like another twist remake..... they should've titled it : Color purple: the next chapter or should've came up with a different storyline and different characters and new phrases like they did in the original...I've never saw the play.. just the movie...but the movie was a classic...my opinion it's time for new classics
Beautiful 💜💜💜💜💜
7 months in advance tho? 🤔
I can’t wait
🤗🤔🫣😒😮‍💨🫤🙄😑
Another great movie they are going to ruin with a crappy remake
This is Breathtaking. I did watch Colour Purple so many times and i really loved it for what it is. but this is soo much needed to compliment the original. it is so beautiful. the Trailor is on point i have been crying just for Sieng Halle run away scene. I Love love love how the world is changing to seek beauty and renaissance in every situation.
I’m so excited for this ❤
Fantasiaaa! 👏
Mmmm...Yes..black men bad.
Cant wait to see it. The original was the first mivie i ever saw and yhe only time ny mom ever went to the movies
OMG!!!!!!! I grew up watching The Color Purple as a kid. I saw Color Purple on Broadway with Fantasia. Everyone of us was crying in that theater. I cant wait to see this film!!!!!!!!!!!
Nah im good. I will not watch a movie produced by a child trafficking demon called oprah.
No
Wow!! Looks good!
So excited, but the trailer.... stop adding those overbearing drums to the music. Nobody is impressed anymore. The color purple doesn't need to sound like Inception.
Omg! I can not wait! I’m taking my little sister! I’m so excited!
Absolutely not 😂
Oh, I can’t wait. Although, I love the original, I’m excited for the new one. 👏🏻❣️
I've only seen snippets of the Broadway adaptation online, so I'm really excited to see this! ❤    That said, I must say, whomever is behind marketing and promotion is a GENIUS! Putting this out in the midst of The Little Mermaid 🧜🏽‍♀️ promos and highlighting Halle as one of the feature characters is BRILLIANT!  Don't get me wrong, Fantasia, Taraji, Danielle are standouts all by themselves, but those of us who know The Color Purple, know that Halle's character isn't really a main protagonist.  They are riding that TLM Disney promotion train because people (late comers...IYKYK😊) are realizing Halle's talent and want to see what she's is in next. Gotta love it!
Gonna watch it
Pass me the tissue paper cause I'm gonna be a sappy mess after this film. I love this cast!!! Can't wait for Christmas!!
this looks fantastic
Fantasia coming for that Oscar.
👌👌👌
"a bold new take on the beloved classic" WHY ARE Y'ALL SELLING IT LIKE THAT???? IT'S NOT EVEN A REMAKE!!!!!
lol this is a record size fish-a major flopper
Star studded
SMH you all will never learn this was a classic that shouldn’t have been remade. You can only make trash movies for my people nothing good or original
"A bold new take" = the Disneyfied version.
STOKED!
If there's no Oscar for this one then I strongly suggest all black actors/actresses boycott the Academy awards! Fantasia, H.E.R. in this classic remake, I mean... DAYUM!!!
Its not very diverse
It is beautiful
The color dark brown of African American
Okay y’all better sing!! 👏👏🙌 I’m really excited for this one 🤞💜 This also makes me realize how much the 1985 cast put their hearts into their performances. It was heartbreakingly beautiful then and now I appreciate seeing the version of the play I never got to.
But they done got Teraji P. Henson as Shuggg Night and Fantasia then H.E.R. and HALLE in one movie yesssssssss❤❤❤❤❤
Im glad Spielberg is part of this project
I cried the first time I saw the original film, when I was a kid. But something tells me I'm going to smile since it's going to be based on the Broadway version. Plus even more awesome that Oprah & Spielberg are back but as producers, it's as if they enjoyed each other's work on the original film.
No
Why don't y'all quit b*tching whoever wants to watch the movie just watch it and the ones who don't just don't smh it's going to be an amazing film and millions will be going to see it that's it that's all.
GOD 1ST ALWAYS Y'ALL TENNESSEE SAYING
Wow FANTASIA is top billing, but Halle is getting all of the media attention from this. You see how the machine works? Wow. Sad.
This looks so good! Fantasia's going to knock it out of the park!
I am looking forward to seeing Harry in more movies
I can not wait to see it! The fact that most ppl don't really see the tragic storyline but want to just laugh at some parts (tag lines)of the original movie is really sad. Hopefully they will see all versions in a new light.... original movie,  the play, the book.
Been a fan of Danielle Brooks and Fantasia… im excited to watch this ❤
Is that Fantasia?
Spielberg and Quincy Jones thank you for making the color purple for all woman who have such beautiful singing voices . Hallie Baily I’m very proud of you for changing singing voices .
I CANNOT WAIT 🙌🏽👏🏽
They need to Leave. It. ALONE!!!
The Black Renaissance of our present era is in full vigor.
I can see the Ghanaian cultural dance at the beginning of the trailer
Phenomenal.. Gave me goosebumps.
Did they just turn this into musical?
ахахха боже,очередная помойка,которая показывает  ту самую истину,которую не получилось передать ни в книге, ни в оригинальном фильме) И обратите внимание,что  выходит 25 декабря и 18 января ))) теперь за Оскар можно не бояться
We need this!!❤❤
On Broadway, FYE, fun fact, Fantasia was  Ceily in the musical
Hollywood has no originality anymore 👎🏿👎🏿.
Lord have mercy this trailer gave me chills! I can’t wait to see it! I hope I don’t cry too much 🖤
But....... why?
WOW..I GJUST GOTTA ALITTLE GOOSEBUMPS.THE REMAKE&REIMAGING.
Brauh make some white movies why keep us in yall mind
Iconic
Waiting Chloe Bailey act makes me cry. She’s so beautiful… I needed this representation growing up my goodness
I shleep 😴😴
I wanna watch this so bad 😩
I have watched this trailer 10 times and I got goosebumps each time. Fantasia???? Her pipes have always been immaculate!!! Gorgeous and perfect casting!!! ❤
Wow, Halle is booked and busy👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Love to see it!
WE  WUZ KANGZ N  SHIET
Bold new take means instead of them hinting about the lesbianism we’re going to see some full on scissoring
I wasn’t to crazy about the first one but I’m definitely gonna go see this one
I am invested already. Love this trailer so so much
Ma storie nuove non le sanno trovare ? Il film originale era un capolavoro,  non c'è bisogno di questi reboot
I'm actually interested in seeing this one! I'd actually go by myself with no issue.
Fantasia and Halle y’all deserves all the awards!! Where’s Ciara!?
Looks amazing.
I can’t wait ❤
I'm projecting: •Fantasia for Best Actress  •Halle Bailey for Best Supporting Actress •I'm Here for Best Original Song (tho I'm not sure if it counts since the movie's an adaptation?) Regardless, I'm hoping to see Fantasia perform it at the Oscars.
Omg❤❤❤❤😢😅😊😢😢😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Why they are not casting Asian or Hispanic?
A man comes up to you on the street and the first thing he says to you is, afternoon I needs me a wife  You run as fast as you can in the opposite direction  You say no thank you  That’s a hard pass for me  Ewww
Where Halle Bailey deserves to stay
Omg!! Definitely watching this!
As someone who LOVES the original, this looks like it's going to be great too 🤓
So does this take place after Little Mermaid
But why the color of the tittle font PINK ????
I can’t wait
For a second I thought another black panther wakanda forever footage🤣🤣😅
THE MAN BEHIND OF THE SLAUG-
Saw Fantasia play Celie on stage in LA. This will be a treat!
OMG, Fantasia's voice almost brought me to tears. 😢 So beautiful!! This looks really good. 💜
Dec? Why we gotta wait that long? Sheeshhh
Fantasia's voice is definately top 10 - 20 all time. & thats saying something given how many great singers there have been over the last century
Fantasia continues to give me goosebumps and teary eyed when I hear her sing…🖤🖤🖤🖤Not a big fan of musicals. I most definitely will be watching this~
Ohhh now she getting ally the roles ? Yeah she got in that illuminati room
This trailer brings tears to my eyes. I cannot wait to see if. ❤❤❤
This is Miss Halle Bailey’s year🥺✨
I can not wait 😩😩😩 At first I questioned if we needed a new adaptation of a movie that’s still so fresh and beautifully written. But after seeing this trailer… I couldn’t stop crying. I’m so excited! 😩❤️😭
Christmas Day?????
Halle Bailey is not an actress just because she woke up and decided to be one. She cannot act, and it shows. What a poor accent, and how out of place she looks compared to everyone else, yet somehow on another "big" screenplay. Throw her back in acting school.
Weuzkangz
Now this is a movie I can get with, I can’t wait to see what they do with it. It looks absolutely amazing, I think it’s going to be like a musical 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Fantasia vs Lily Gladstone will be a battle of the century. Joy + heart transcends all. She is out of this world!!!
This movie and the actors in it better get an Oscar nomination
Another black film
This actually looks amazingly good 👍🏾 I love the original and I’m really not into musicals but this really looks good!
can not wait til xmas
How many of these movies do we need? Same old bs.
It's official - Halle Bailey is THAT girl!!!Remember the name.
Another L for black men. Back to finish us off.
Coolio!
I know the Africa scenes will b fire cuz it’s from the same person who co directed black is king
Fantasia get that Oscar spearhead ready baby this is your moment
So let's just call this "The  Musical" on video, yes? BECAUSE: _______________: *CHOSE YOUR OWN REASON. ALL ARE ACCEPTABLE* I personally loved both book and the original dramatic film which was cruelly robbed of multiple Oscars. *MULTIPLE* . I do not care how anyone else feels about it. Nor should anyone care how I feel about it. Bless.
This looks like absolute trash.  The original is a masterpiece.  This is actually an insult to t he story
we wuz kangazzz and shiiiiii 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Where is the inclusion ? Dylan mulvaney should be celie. Anya taylor joy as shug.
Looks absolutely amazing and the cast is stacked 💙 🙌🏾
If they are going to be more faithful to the book, they will be able to show the explicit sexual scene of Shug and Celie in the original film, they only put a little kiss and that's it
…talk about the PERFECT casting!  😮 WOW!
The original is classic and can be seen a thousand times, there was no need for a remake
Warner Bros is at it again using their IP's by casting Halle Bailey to compete with Disney's The Little Mermaid remake
God loves you and he wants to save everyone, but in order for him to do that, you need to repent and be baptized 🙏🏾❤️
Go Tasia gooooooo I’ll be there
Please, God, let this be good
Ive gotta watch the original film before seeing this. I didnt know this version is based off a musical though. Now the musical choice isnt weird. But I'll take this mainly because it doesn't pull a Woman King, and there's no freakin' blackwashing here either. The source material has black characters to begin with, unlike The Little Mermaid.  Speaking of, it is too funny that Halle Bailey is in this. I said she deserves better than that blackwash Little Mermaid remake. Welp, she gets this, which will certainly make more money.   AND she gets this movie in the same year. What were the odds of that happening?
Wow great to see this adaptation looks amazing and Halle Bailey is on fire so happy 🔥❤️
😢😢😢😢😢 oh my god I’m so excited! ❤❤❤
For a second I thought this title was colored people
🔥🔥
Nope
The original is so good! Glad they ain’t make a straight up remake instead they decided to be close to the original story. Also directed by Oprah !!! Yesss and hallee even better
🤣🤣 why her eyes like that???
Music of this movie will certainly give goosebumps.❤️
YASSSS !!! So excited for this!!!!
Mixed feelings on this.  I generally hate remakes, and generally don't like singers pretending to be actors.  But at the same time, this looks like it might be decent and I hope it does well.
The opening when they show the beautiful dancers in ceremonies in Africa, that looks like an Akan ethnic group. One of the most famous and influential, ethnic groups of Africa. They are a matrilineal people, the blood of the family is traced through the mothers as opposed to fathers. A man’s place is traces through his mother. Thus a strong relationship between the Queen Mother and the King is paramount. A great choice for this remake about the intersectional discrimination that AfricanAmericans have always had to face historical racism, misogyny, & colorism/featurism -darker type skin, full lips, type 4 hair, bootylicious curves etc, common African features deemed as either un-feminine or fetishized. I hope this movie delves as genuinely deep into the sorrows as much as it soars into the heights of victory. All the actresses are fire, but Phylicia Mossi is gorgeous (& was made for the role) & I’m really excited for the amazing singing talent of Fantasia (my mother’s favorite AmericanIdol, one of her favorite singers).
Watch the original, it was great. This looks like garbage.
Well, I know what I'm doing Xmas Day! Take my money now!
This is funny I don't know how to take this it will never take the place of the real color purple they tried lol
WE ARE READY TO PURCHASE ON GAWD
Kind of interesting that majority of the thumbnails on YouTube for this movie trailer is of Halle. I see you marketing.
When I heard about this film, I thought it was an unnecessary remake of a classic film.  I'm so glad that this is not a remake of The Color Purple film, but instead, it is based on The Color Purple musical.  The trailer looks really good.
Hollywood. Please do not snub Fantasia of the Oscar nomination and win I’m gonna be hysterical this movie season!
Well, no original ideas these days
What is the point of this?
I wish we could blast this movie at the Florida Governor's Mansion. Woke is not dead in Florida. 😊
So why is this trailer getting dislike bombed?
I cannot wait to see this I hope its as amazing as the original film 😘
I have to be the only child that grew up not seeing the original or reading the book because I wasn't allowed.
God they have some big people behind the movie nice
Halle stay in wet 😂😂
You sho is ugly!
Que belleza 🎬🍾🎬🍾
I’m so excited 💜🎉🎊
Leave classic movies alone.
Is Halley Beiley year?...she is everywhere and I love it!!!
As a fan of Fantasia, I’m soooooo damn Proud of her, everything she’s been through has lead her to this beautiful point…I’m so happy for her and just know this moment is going to change her life.
I knew this day would come and by Oprah and Steven Spielberg ... oh no
This fabulous!!!!!!!! Let's Go Yo !!!!!
Halle?!?! She's doing her thing.
This gave me the chills. 💜
I’ve been needing a musical movie version ever since I saw the Broadway show a couple of years ago 😭 I’m so excited! Such a powerful story!
THE COLOR PURPLE??? MUSICAL???? WTF !!! SMH
I thought this is a HBO max project cause of the purple colour
The little Mermaid looks different
Hope Oprah gets a Cameo
We're calling an Instant Classic here! The cast and production team!! Whew! Many people seem to think that this is a simple remake. It is not. This movie is set apart and intended to be its own thing, an adaptation of the original. Let's goooo!!
This would be a better musical than current Disney remakes
The book saved my life. I took my daughter to the Broadway show, it was phenomenal! This trailer looks beautiful. I can hardly wait to see this version!
Fantasia Oscar Winner Barrino incoming
For the first time ever, a trailer made me cry. I’m so serious 🥹
Damn this is one of them trailers that already got my eyes welling up
I hope this isn't a musical.  Don't nobody want nor asked for that.
such a perfect role for her.....
Muita responsa fazer remake de um put@ clássico mas, pelo trailler, pareçe que cumpriram bem a missão. Ansioso !
I thought they said Ciara was in this too and that she played the grown version of Halle
Great now I’m crying
We don’t need more space movies
HALLE IS IN TWO MOVIES NOW????!!!!
Can't wait
Phenomenal ✨😊😊
I’m so happy to see Fantasia and Danielle Brooks!!!
You had me at Fantasia! I love the other ladies also! I was blessed to see Fantasia in the Color Purple years ago at the Foxx Theater in Atlanta and she brought the house down!
Hallie and Gabby are Disney queens and legends #blackdisneyqueensrule🤎👑
Gabby went from Disney queen to musical movie queen 👑
Hallie went from Disney mermaid queen 👑🧜 to Broadway musical movie queen 👑#blackqueensrule👑
Stop making slave movies!!!!
Halle Bailey could make 2 billion dollar films in the same year if the world taps into the nostalgia and support this generational classic! Wow what a  Christmas gift!
The Color Purple
Excellent cast.
Man I can’t wait to see this! My first EVER and only broadway play I’ve seen was color purple with Fantasia starring as Celie. I was blown away and I will never forget that experience
I remember watching the Spielberg version starring Whoopi Goldberg. It was spectacular. Can’t wait this stunning musical remake.
if a film is good enough to make a remake, just watch the original.
i'm crying right now. thank you. halle bailey, tariji,  and fantasia are going to be amazing in the film. i can already see it. fantasia better get nominated if nothing else.
All not going home
No, thanks....I'm good.
Damn good 😮
WB > Disney receswap garbage
I am so ready for this!!!  💜  #WarnderBrosPictures  #TheColorPurple  #TheColorPurple2023
I loved the movie with Whoopi.  However, it took such a heavy toll on me emotionally, I swore I’d never watch it again. There is so much power and uplift in this music.  I cannot wait to see this Broadway adaptation.  I’m really rooting for Fantasia.  She and Halle Bailey are so incredibly talented.
Black lifes matter🙏
Fantasia having her full-circle moment! She totally deserves it! Love her!!
I thought Nettie was dark skinned but go off
What next Roots the musical. No thank you. We want to Queen Amina of Zaria, Mansa Musa not this bs.
Casting director ❤
The Little Mermaid 2 is different
I cannot wait to behold this cinematic experience.
I WAITED FOR AGES 😭
Baby I'm here for it! I'm already there!
Halle Berry as a kid! Wow that's a dang good CGI!
Not digging the cast except for Colman Domingo and brooks. Not expecting this to be a big hit.
What a CAST....Period! Already looking forward!🙏🏾🙏🏾🥰💜💜🎬📽🎞
❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢
Okay Halle girl I see you ! , I’m kinda here for it a lil excited not gone lie
If her performance in this movie is anything like her performance at the Tony awards, she will win an Oscar.
Looks cool
Don't be fooled by this movie cause blacks in this that's the deception black people can't follow alot of inspiriting uplifting movies for the young gen x not this one not for the gen z either Cleopatra, mermaid,
Not another suffering black folk movie.  Good ensemble but not paying to see it.
Color Purple is one of my favorite movies.  They should have left this alone
I love the book, I love the movie, I love the Broadway show, and I know I will love this too.
Halle 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This remind me of sarafina
i haven't cried from a movie  trailer in a while.
this looks so good!!!!! :D
I can’t wait🤲🏾🥰🙏🏾
Idk if im gonna like this version to be honest
Oscar
They are using part of the book
hey its little mermaid lmfao
WOW!!!!!! Yall this going to be GOOD!!!
I wonder how many times Matt Stele watched this trailer..
I don’t know. The original was iconic, and this is a musical. It feels wrong because the trauma now seemed not so PTSD.
"You told Harpo to beat ME!!"
I am all here for this black representation. Diversity
This really is lovely.
I'm there Christmas 🎄 Day!!💯That brief clip of Halle gave me chills. Fantasia will no doubt be amazing. The Cast is phenomenal! Let's get this Oscar!!
Pensé que era la sirenita
Okay FANTASIA!!! I miss seeing her she is such a joy!
That girl playing Nettie looks like Ariel 🤭.
Fantasia's voice alone is worth seeing this, looks great!
I can’t wait to see this movie, I can already see it’s going to be great!!!
No thank you.  The original was a masterpiece.  Hollywood is out of ideas.
This one should win the Oscars in 2024!!!
So much cool
Oh wowww the cast line up isss AMAZINGGG
Crazy that Jennifer Hudson wants to do a versus against Fantasia. JHud has a wonderful voice and can sing like an Angel, but Fantasia is like a force of nature!
here for it!
Fantasia deserves every good thing this life has to offer!
Oh look 👀 DeSantis has already banned the the movie in Florikkka…☹️😳 Wonder when they have announced it”s banned from all southern states???
The moment Fantasia entered the picture... WOW.
Didnt this movie already get a remake?
Were is the diversity!? This is rascit!
I feel that maybe this director jumped up to this level of film too fast. It looks like TV.
❤❤❤
It's a NO for me 😒
Halle what’s next?? Fast & Furious 11!!??? 😭 She doing her thang 🎉 And Fantasia!!!!! I’m so excited
beautiful!!
Omg the casts ❤
Halle leading yet another Bomb...must be nice to get roles based solely on skin color and not any actual talent #backwardsracismISathing
Of all the remakes…. “ beens wonderin when wes gonna get dis film boss “
Why?   Nothing can compare to the original.
I saw Fantasia on Broadway in this and I cannot wait to see this adaptation. She is amazing and so is this story and this production. ❤🎉
Wow so many levels of black greatness ❤❤❤
This looks amazing ❤❤❤❤
Gave me goosebumps listening to Fantasia sing! I can not wait!!!
Let’s give fantasia her flowers!!
CHILLLLSSSSSSSS oh my god
I'm so glad Danielle is doing Sophia again!! She slayed on Broadway

I absolutely LOVED this movie.  It was a staple of my childhood as my sisters and I watched it repeatedly as we grew up.  So Iconic.  I don’t care that is actually based off the broadway musical.  I’m watching because i love love LOVE the movie.  Ohh be still my heart.  This is going to be amazing!!!
I really enjoyed The Color Purple "live" musical, I actually saw it last in late January 2020 at the State Theater in NJ, when things were still "normal", before all the Covid 19 shutdowns began!!!   I really enjoyed all of the original songs that were written & created for the musical version, (much MORE than I expected to!!!)  🎶  lol
I'm tired of this story
Might have to watch the original again.  It's been decades since I saw it last.
Queens? 😂😂😂 Laughable... Pushing literal false history... literally said "we wuz queens" 💀gtfo
I don't know how they can improve on the original. Hopefully this movie gets people to watch the original
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯. I can't wait!!!!!
One of my favorites movies of all times, and now I'm really excited to watch this new version.
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom Teaser Trailer Drop Plise...... 🤕🤕🥰
Ward🎉…$15$ AF. May B2 B3©️™️®️💎🔒
Y’all this coming out Xmas ! Meaning this will be a contender for Oscar’s
Can't wait to see this movie🤎🤎🤎
So sick of Hollywood rehashing OLD movies 😡
Oh look, Hollywood is monetizing black people's past struggles again.
Can't wait to see this 😊
I used to *LOVEEEEEEEE* this movie, but I won't be going to see this mess!!!!! With Okra behind this, *I KNOWWWWW* the *ZEST-FEST* is gonna be all up & through it, starting with the actor playing Mister! I'm gonna pass bcuz I'm not with the *ZESTY AGENDA!* I'll stick with the original, thx, but *NO THX!!!!!*
Some people just love taking my money. If it looks that nice, I’ll see it twice.
I’m so excited!!!!!
You gotta beat her harpo
Right. Instead of turning on my perfectly good copy of the original film adaptation, I’m going to watch a film adaptation of the stage musical adaptation of the original book. I’ll just listen to the new soundtrack instead.
Fantasia’s vocals gave me chills, my goodness!
Can’t wait ❤❤❤❤
I love this! But I wonder why there's no Cynthia Erivo this time?
I like the original from 1985.
So this is a musical 🎵
some more propaganda
THERES NO WAY HALLE’S IN THE MOVIE WOW
This looks AMAZING!!! 🔥
A musical adaptation of Alice Walker's novel about the life-long struggles of an African-American woman living in the south during the early 1900s
PERFECT CAST! ✨✨✨
How does this chick keep getting roles? She looks like Sid the Sloth.
I CANNOT WAIT!!!!!
nah, nobody going to support this. stop with the bs blk struggle stories
Halle is such a great actress im so happy about the whole cast im ready now ♥️♥️♥️
if they´re gonna make this a musical well thats a hard pass for me
Fantasia should definitely play the role of Marjorie Rose Foraukis in "Schaumburg's Sweet Reminisce".
I was fortunate to see this on Broadway with Fantasia and cannot wait to see the movie version.  Love the casting, I’m excited 😆
Many of the scenes in this trailer look like from some television movie. Oscar chances extremely low
Yes♥️♥️♥️
They finna give bw a real reason to hate niggas with this one
In literal tears after watching this trailer , the original Color Purple had such an impact on me as a young black girl ,the first time I watched it and even seeing it over again and again as an adult ,this amazing story that Ms.Alice Walker told is immortalized and still so very polarizing In 2023 ,I gotta go see this with my mom.
This is going to be GOOD!
It's funny how Halle is featured as the "main" star in the trailer (and rightfully so due to her also starring in the Little Mermaid - take advantage of the moment) but in reality she's not going to be too heavily involved in the movie.
I’m just here for the flood of “why do we need another remake?” comments, even though this is an adaptation of the Broadway musical, which was closer to the Alice Walker novel then the Steven Spielberg movie was… 🙄
I don’t want to be sit until the 25th of December 🤬😂😂😂
Ariel is here, yes!
The vocals to this movie are going to be SPECTACULAR. Cannot wait.
This story is teuly a special piece of art. Its for black women theough and through its us.
y'all.. that's heavy 😢. Wowza. I cannot wait.
Yes why can't they just make new movies Talking about all these Remake movies they're making. It's a good movie but it's good as it is.
Google the author of The Color Purple and her thoughts on Jewish people
Should've been Cynthia Erivo
I’m so excited for this movie omg !
ok.   i'll give it a pass in the complaint department, ... Oprah, Q-Jones, its NOT a remake of the original.  (thank goodness)  Musical or not, as long its not the "new" replacement for what  was already Iconic, i'm happy.   Cast looks great.   I do hope it is a bit of a musical.....
Horrible idea. Why would they do this?
I’m liking what I see
I might have to check this out. 😊
I wonder how the poster will be in China...
Ah yes... the 'we come from kings and queens' line once again! ...
This looks incredible
Wow.
This is the most star studded cast i have seen in ages
We wuz kangz n shii
The original film with Whoopi Goldberg is one of the most beautiful films ever made.  Hope this new adaptation from the Broadway musical will carry some of the same magic.
The black community will never learn.  Exactly what Kevin Samuels meant. Smh.
Cealy fine this time around 🤣🤣🤣❤️
oh this gon be GOOD❤❤
That’s pink and violet, not purple.
FANTASIA!!!!!!!!!!!
Halle Bailey has become one of the main stars of the new Gen Z generation and Im so happy
Ok Haley do it this and the little mermaid 🧜‍♀️ yes queen ❤ slay the industry
This is going to be huge especially for Fantasia, always felt like she got put on the back burner as far as acting roles would've loved to have seen her play Aretha Franklin
THAT CAST!!!!!! IS FIRE!!!!!! ❤
I'm gone be in that theater having church! They knew to bring Tasia back!
No Thank you . Nice try . The original cast was the best and Whoopi Goldberg’s shoes are very hard to fill . It’s a great production yes … but it needs more than that for this movie to be successful…. sorry .
I'm truly disappointed that this remake did not take a chance for a more diverse cast. Instead the cast is just as homogenous as in the original. It's 2023!
I was soooo close to seeing this screening I can’t wait to see this
This is going to be good! I can’t wait!!! 💃🏽
Halley's year 🥰
Why didn't they race swap this? It just seems a little insensitive not to have an Asian, Latino, or at least a Transgender in the lead role. Oprah needs to check her privilege.
It’s a musical.. Booooooooooooooooooo
We are going to be in there like we were in the theatre for Wakanda… What’s are we wearing??? What’s the dress code?
I feel like I would love a chicken head remake of many movies
H.E.R. is gonna be Squeak? with her deep voice? That's a surprising casting.
On my goodness! Again? There ain’t no other stories?
Um, I already saw this movie.   Where is the Static Shock ⚡💙✊🏿 movie?
🗣️ OSCARS! Don’t Fuvk this one up! Yes it’s a musical but It deserves its flowers. Still can’t believe the original got nominated 11 times and didn’t win one Oscar.
Wow this looks absolutely great never really know the broadway musical but I will now
Now who asked Harpo for this?
🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤢🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮
I am normally absolutely dead set against remakes of the movies from my childhood. But I would watch Taraji read a grocery list so I definitely want to see this movie. It looks amazing!
Wish I got to see the musical on Broadway, I definitely will not miss this.
Warner Bros Discovery the only studio giving so much variety for everybody. Evil Dead Rise, The Flash, Wonka, Dune Part 2, The Color Purple, Meg 2: The Trench, Blue Beetle, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, The Nun 2, Barbie,
💯💯💯💯💯
TAYYSTEEEEE
This has Oscar written all over it!
Can we just leave the classics alone please
I loved the book and the movie! I had it on VHS. Ah! Can’t wait to see this live. The musical 🎤 was beloved.
Yeaaaaah nahhh I'm good some stuff you just leave alone but then again I don't like musicals and this is what it comes from. Also Fantasia does tooooooooo much darn screaming for me her and Jennifer Hudson
Why am I so emotional?! I CAN NOT WAIT!!! All these Beautiful and Talented Black Women. Tasia Voice! I know it’s going to be Amazing.
Set*
This is going to be a disappointment Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey said the benchmark way too high for any remakes
WHY?
Nope. Not seeing it.
CHILLS!!
I can’t wait to see this!!!!
I CANT WAITTTTT ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Just saw the trailer. I cannot wait to see the movie!
The fact I’m just not hearing about this and it has Halle Bailey Fantasia Barrino and  Taraji P. Henson all in the same movie?!?!?!?! This is definitely going to be one of the greatest remakes amongst the black community the color purple plays a big part of the culture and community
I didn't know I wanted so much!!❤
now this is how you do a remake
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I wanna see this
This looks very strong, im looking forward to it.
Cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looks ammmaaaazzziiing
Omg I can’t wait ❤❤❤
Is this an adaptation of the musical co-penned by Brenda Russell?
💜💜💜💜💜
Taraji, Halle, Danielle Brooks & FANTASIA!?! & It's the color purple!?!? Bruh we finna eat.
Sorry but why?
The Color Purple will be a must watch because of this phenomenal ensemble cast!
Fantasia ❤
No all around …none of the actors have any umph to them
I loved the way Cynthia ervo played Celine her voice is incredible. But fantasia is an amazing singer as well can’t wait to see how this turns out.
😊
I'm upset this hasn't been recast with anglo actors. We need this story told from the Irish slave perspective.
It’s only if DC fly was harpo 🤣😂IYKYK
Omg❣
All I know is the singing will be exceptional ❤I'm here for this!!!
Excellent casting
Ok, I like the trailer. When it says a bold new take. I hope it is. I hope the movie is just like Alice Walkers book. If it's not, then I'm sure Alice Walker will be disappointed. I hope that the cast and crew of this movie had Alice Walker on set every day or almost every day to get her input and insight. I'm kinda hoping that Alice Walker is a producer on this. All I'm really saying is that this movie ought to be and should be as close to the book as possible. If it is bravo but if it is not then I will be very disappointed. I have been saying for years that they need to do a color purple remake, but this kinda looks like the Broadway show put on the big screen. If that is the case, then I'm already disappointed. When is a director going to make a bold decision to do the Color Purple remake and do it right,make it as close to the book as possible. I will see this movie but I already know that I will be disappointed. My Grandma had bought the book years ago. She read it. She saw the movie and liked it. I saw the movie when I got older. I like the movie but when I skimmed through the book,I thought to myself the book is way better then The movie and I know what people are going to say oh you can't put every single detail from the book and put it in the movie and I say bs on that. A director can put every single detail from the book right into the movie. So what if the movie is 3 or 4 hours? That's not the point and shouldn't even be an issue. The point is making the movie just like the book. That's all I'm saying.
The disrespect
For a movie called "the color purple" I saw qute a little purple color
As long as we get to see the part “All my life I had to Fight” we good
Yes thank you!! I’ve needed it!
All my life!! I had to fight!!
For Halle and Taraji we will be sitting 😍❤️
This Christmas
I AM CRYINNGGGGGGGGGG OMG FANTASIA!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭 I’ll be a whole mess in that theater! ❤
1st off this CAST is exceptional! 2nd of all I never thought I’d be so excited to see The Color Purple 🥲 but I can’t wait
This some more black men are bad black women are queens bs.
Well, if this is on the level of the musical, I am game...and maybe, just maybe, it can spell redemption twice come Oscar time. Sure, it is too early to start thinking about it, but my 36th year is looking purple and not the color of what represents that particular anniversary.
They made the Oscar and all the awards happen for Jennifer Hudson. It's finally Fantasia's film moment too. And H.E.R.!!! Can't wait.
Correct me if I'm wrong but we read this book in junior high/high school right??? Name seems familiar... Wish it wasn't a musical though cuz I usually like seeing book to screen adaptations...
We royalty.. no you were the ones that royalty discarded and sold off to strangers
This might be shown during The Little Mermaid. But if I wanted to show another trailer, I'd see the first trailer of Wonka. When do you think the Wonka trailer will drop?
Nice to see the comments before the bigots get here
Fantasia was born to play this role! I'm so thrilled for her.
This trailer should have that it's based on the musical or it's the musical in movie. Anything like that in text for this trailer. More people know about the movie than the musical. That's the trailer's fault for not having some text on it saying from the musical or anything like that. It just makes it seem like a lot of movies and tv shows that can't come up with another name or they wanna make a better version of the original which ends up being a totally different movie or show that the name should've been different. Maybe they'll have a trailer mentioning that it's based on the musical, like how other trailers do when people think that it's a remake or a part 2 without any of the original cast. Though they should've done that in the first trailer released.
steven spielberg and quincy jones?! This is gonna be great! The music sounds great!
❤
Hollywood has truly ran out of ideas
Aw, man! Christmas?!
Garbage 🗑️
Okay. I'm interested.
5th December,  damn why so far away.
Where’s ciara? I wonder if they cut her part out 🤔
OMG! about to cry
One just damn know well that this will not disappoint because it’s coming from the producers of BOTH the film and the musical!
You lost me at “bold new take” gonna be fuckn stupid. Original is goated
Wow I shed a tear, this is amazing!
This looks like it’s going to be a must see for me
yeah no.  the original movie was better
1:55 did they forget her name ?
I was coming to complain and then I heard Fantasia singing...   Never mind.
I thought this was a Mace Windu origin story trailer for a second
Stop the black male hating. Those Oprah Winfrey, Alice Walker , Main Stream Media negative propaganda days of the 90s are gone. We will put you on blast now.
I *love* Fantasia!! I got chills watching this. I am SO excited.
Is Fantasia playing Suge Avery?  I'm not familiar with the musical.
Can we make new movies? that haven't been made already?
Good trailer but i dont know about fantasia being the lead tho . But i guess u gotta trust Oprah and Spielberg tho i ll give it a chance
Go Halle 😆
No one--not Fantasia, not JHud--can top Cynthia Erivo's version of "I'm Here."
...but.....why?
Why not take a leaf out of all other Hollywood movies and cast white people? I mean black ppl getting cast as white ppl is the norm nowadays.
They should've jyst filmed the stage version. Filmed on stage always looks and feels better....a genuine energy
Halle in this movie? 1000%. Halle as Ariel? Nope. #NotmyAriel
I can't believe I have to wait until Christmas to see this
So how come some of the characters aren't or asian or something other than black like they do with other remakes where they change a lot of characters  to blacks. Should go both ways. Fair is fair. Diversity.
Ghana is representing this time 🇬🇭🔥🥶
I smell some Oscars.
Taraji coming for that best supporting actress oscar!!! Cant wait!!!
Omg ❤ amazing. OSCAR WINNER!
H.E.R ❤️
Mid
Nah, I'll pass. I stick with Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover. Hollywood keeps on sh*tting in the classics.
More race baiting, make black women hate whites and black men now. Great. Where is Larry Fink getting all that money from btw? Too many woke companies to pay ffs
already in tears. This is going to be a beautiful film
This is not a REMAKE of the original 1985 film, it’s an adaptation of the stage musical. Thought everyone should know. I’m actually interested in seeing this, it’s looks so good!!
I'm all in with this adaptation of The Color Purple.
oh this is lovely.  I cry every time I watch the film and it deserved an academy award imho.   I look forward to this.
This would have been a better movie and more equitable if the cast was white and not black.
Should of made it with Asian people for it to be on brand
I never got to see the broadway play. However I listen to the soundtrack so many times. I love the original movie so much, this looks like an amazing adaptation.
FINALLY!!!!❤
I hate movie remakes. They need to stop. We need more original films!
It's a musical.  The original is a classic.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I haven't seen the Broadway, but this one has caught my interest 😲
I’m tearing up..beautiful, just Beautiful ❤❤❤❤
YES!!!!!!!!!!
This trailer brought tears to my eyes 😫 i will be watching for sureeeeee
again strong blckman and weak white man?
I didn't get to see the musical, but definitely going to support this adaptation.  I think the cast is going to be great but Fantasia is going kill it and Halle is killing the entire Hollywood game right now.  Can't Walt.
I cannot wait!! ❤❤❤
Wow that farksinned girl looks strikingly similar to the girl from original Color of Purple great casting
I would've liked a LITTLE more music from the show being that I did the show and it was INCREDIBLE!!!
Steven Spielberg out here single-handedly keeping the musical genre alive and thriving
I Love the original ‼️ and this looks amazing I’m definitely going to watch ❤️
got my hands doing good like they s'pose to 💜
Looks amazing!
This trailer made me cry a lot! 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Love this trailer! But where is the wonka one?
This movie is going to be a RESET. Bring it Phylicia Pearl Mpasi!
I LOVED the musical so I know this movie is going to WRECK me in the best way. I AM READY!
looks beautiful. stellar cast
I CAN'T WAIT!!!! ❤
Chills!
Why can’t they just leave stuff alone make new movies stop going back to good IPs that are timeless to remake this anit it
They do not have an original idea?  Why they remaking a movie that is perfect and part the greatest films ever made?
Rain during the separation scene is a little cliche
Danielle Brooks had the best character on OITNB. I can't wait to see her in this!
Black Americans always like playing themselves in traumatic movies and tv shows...no magical, no scientific, no healthy love stories, no horror, no action, no nothing else.
That song Fantasia singing always brings tears to my Eyes 😅🎶💪🏾
I really thought this was a remake to the classic film but it's a musical and that's totally fine with me but I feel like Fantasia is going to killed it as Cecily and Oscars here we come! Cause I know this whole entire cast  will deliver a performance of a "Lifetime" 👏❤🔥
Won’t be the same without the Quincy jones score
As soon as Fantasia started singing, I began to cry!! 🥹 What an INCREDIBLE cast! Christmas is too far away!!
O wow must say this look a bit better than the original ❤
Your kidding right? This looks like an average musical with a non diverse cast. No thank you.
Why is halle’s skin so much darker? Like damn if you needed a brown skin black woman don’t choose a light skinned black woman to paint her face a shade darker that’s just wrong.
Halle Bailey is on a roll
I saw Fantasia on Broadway in "The Color Purple".  So glad she reprised the role for the movie musical version.  Her voice is magnificent. And I didn't know Taraji P. Henson could sing, she never sang on "Empire".  Great choice for Suge Avery.   Looking forward to the movie.  🙂🙂🙂
I'm too old for this s***t
Dear Hollywood, Africa is Continent. Not a country! The country whose culture is featured in this film is Ghana. Please get it right for once !
Great. The Disney version.
Halle Bailey is gonna shine in the movies! She is gonna be great in The Little Mermaid remake and she looks like she is gonna do great in this movie too!
Wow. This actually looks really good. Im guessing this is more like a musical than an actual remake.
Could have taken Selena Gomes for the lead. Why the lack of inclusion now?
This is my favorite movie if all time and I can’t wait to see it!!!! It looks like it’s going to be absolutely UNBELIEVABLE!!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🤗♥️🙏🏾
Voy a llorar, tengo tantas ganas de verla, por fin todo el mundo va a escuchar esa maravillosa canción cantada por fantasía ❤️
Saw the Broadway show with Fantasia. I cannot wait to see the movie adaptation. I’m Here brings me to tears every time I hear Fantasia sing it. And go Halle. Not only is she making moves, she appears to be making the right moves
I hate black trauma films put us in outer space
Before anyone say anything this not a remake of the 1985 movie this is the Broadway musical version that has been on Broadway for decades now and also has won several Tony's so it makes sense to bring it to film
So proud of Halle.
Sing it Fantasia! Beautiful
Can't wait! Instant classic ❤
Lets admit it, the best actress race at the academy awards is over
Yaaayy love it 🔥🔥🔥
Not sure how the original musical is, but hopefully this isn’t cringe worthy. I’m sure by “bold” new take they mean “Its different to fit our modern day radical opinions to appease the Hollywood agenda
love this
I cant wait see Fantasia get her Oscar
Because if there was a movie that needed to be remade, it was The Color Purple. The Steven Spielberg version is unwatchable, with all that great acting, fantastic cinematography, iconic and emotionally-laden scenes... just wretched, chuck it in the bin I guess because Warner Bros. has no new ideas.
Warner Bros. Pictures Presents, A Harpo Films Production,  An Amblin Entertainment Production,  A Scott Sanders Production/A QJP Production, A Biltz Bazawule Film, Starring Taraji P.

We are not just Kings and Queens. We are at the Centre of the Universe
This looks incredible! Pretty sure it won't be able to be shown in Florida though.
you know, it occurs to me if they ever made a horror version of this story, that's pretty much antebellum
I'm SO happy to see Halle in more movies 🫶
I have such respect for the book and the original film…they better not mess this up please! My wife and I saw the play when fantasia was in it too.
Omg!! all my faves are in this star studded cast. I can’t wait🥹
We Wuz: the movie
They should charles from dairy of a mad black woman to played mister
I'm not sure you can make a better version of the Color Purple than the 80s version with Whoopi and Oprah. Danny Glover was spectacular as Albert the misogynistic antagonist turned remorseful background character and ex-husband.
Halle
Can't wait to see it
Ghana 🇬🇭 🇬🇭 🇬🇭 🇬🇭 🇬🇭 🇬🇭 stand up!!!!
I cannot wait!
Hallie in her bag frfr
Hopefully it does well.
Shouldn't Brie Larson, Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy play the main roles?
The antisjw weirdos will probably want to speak to the manager. Ron Desantis might be pulling his hairs out.
trash
Yes yes yes! After my favorite film of all time, the 1985 version, failed to win an Oscar, hoping this one takes them all home!!
WE
OMG. I am sobbing from this trailer. Fantasia's voice. One of my favorite stories and films.
Just watch the original, read the book or go to the musical. Why would you do this to a classic?
1:06 Produced by Oprah aka Harvey Weinstein's friend ‼
Damn.  Domingo Coleman looks so much like Danny Glover. They're promoting Halle a lot in this bc of Little Mermaid, knowing she'll barely be in this film for 10 min 😂😂
QUEENS AND KANGS MOVIE.
Bruh why tho look the cast is amazing and talented. I love seeing my people shine especially my queens. But why are they remaking this movie it’s fine the way it is leave it alone and do something original instead leave iconic movies alone.
**Marie wants to know your location**
I saw Fantasia play this role here in Chicago. She didn't act it. She LIVED it. I am too excited!!!!!!!!!!
It’s going to be amazing ❤
This is gonna be a hit
This looks amazing, but tbh, Fantasia just isn’t Cynthia Erivo. I honestly would have preferred Cynthia to be in this instead of Wicked. Just my opinion. I’m sure both movies will be great though.
Whenever you're ready to make movies about black women living their best lives, call me
Why?
I’m so over struggle and hardship. Black Americans need to stop letting that define them. Write a new story.
I’m always skeptical of any type of adaptation or remake (I’m unsure why people are saying this isn’t a remake; even if it’s an “adaption” of the play, it’s still from the same source, so it’s a remake), especially with how badly they did Kindred. Anyway, TCP is one of my favorite books, even if it can be a hard read because of the content, so I’ll probably see it.
YES!
I actually want to see this
This is way too cinematic. The Color Purple works best when it's simplistic and about the story. This trailers feels like the people involved were more focused on it being the next big blockbuster movie musical.
Bruh...how many more played out struggle movies do we need? Even going as low as making it a musical???
Yasss can’t wait💜💜💟💟
Maravilhosooooo
NO!!!!!!
I'm so happy for Fantasia!!
Inb4 the racists and Halle haters come here looking for a reason to bash this movie, right after telling us to make original Black movies 🤭
Halle Bailey is blowing up on the scene.
Her:Just in case if little  mermaid flops i will recognize as from this movie.
Ciara not in this anymore?
Esta película huele a Óscar y a Globo de Oro .❤
I see the Ghanaian culture in there 🇬🇭
2023 is Halle’s year wow
The color woke
I mean, the original was an amazing movie. And this looks really great. I'm so happy for Fantasia!
The cast in this is stellar! I havent been in a theater in awhile, but this has to be seen on the big screen 😊
For black history will be getting a movie about George floyd the saint of black people ?
they need to remake the movie "Beloved" next.
There is no diversity in there? Aint it?
Ok, who else thought about the Nicholas Cage's agent from college humor?
I’m crying!!!! This looks beautifully done! Just stunning!
Fantasia's version of I'm Here my favorite! If you have not seen any of her videos performing it live, please treat yourself and got take a gander.
Hollywood just can’t leave good things alone can they?
Omg the chills I just got across my entire body watching this trailer…the cast, the talents, the production, the everything!!! This is going to be historic yet again like 1985…I can’t wait💜
🤎
The girl cast as the ugly girl, wasn't she offended? Lol. So u are going to play the ugly one and she over here will play the pretty one.
I can not wait to see this!!!!
OMG this looks amazing!!!!!!!!!!!
Taraji is going to KILL IT as Shug Avery! ❤
Fantasia better get her Oscar.
I would have loved to have seen more indications that this is a musical. Couldn't you show any scenes where this is clearly the case (more singing, choreography, etc.) instead of a remake?
So there
Its good that they also kept people like Oprah and Spielberg involved. But yet making something new instead of trying to remake the original movie.
I like how they had to put the tagline in there for people who don't understand that this isn't a remake. 😂
we wuz kungz
Wait aren't you a mermaid? The world is painful, go back to the ocean quickly!
I bet the little mermaid haters aren’t going to hate Chloe for this role smdh….
so much rich history to tell about african history but yet again we're focusing on slavery..... yaaaaawn.... black people's pasts are NEVER portrayed in any sort of powerful depiction... it always comes back to slavery in some fashion..
This is going to be instant adaptation of musical movie classic
This better be good, cause it's incredibly beautiful
So it's an adaptation of the Broadway musical...? Well..... Ok then.
Fantasia gets me every time 😢 My girl better rack up during the award season!!! Love seeing Danielle as Sophia!
I can not wait!!!
In case the trailer didn’t make it clear. This movie is actually a musical.
I CAN’T WAIT!!! ❤❤❤
Another un needed remake
NOPE! The original film hit all the feels and was class A acting. This is just another pathetic remake because Hollywood is creatively bankrupt, and they don't want to invest in original stories anymore.
This is better than I expected it to be
HOL UP
I have my tissue ready to cry 😢
My eyes watered! 🥹
Huh. I was expecting some woke BS, but this actually looks pretty good.
So we're just gonna be in a chokehold until December?  Can we do Christmas in July this year??
This made my eyes well
I didn’t even recognize H.E.R. until the end 😂
Kevin Samuels would be proud.
This is amazing Halle is so talented!!! Halle is on a role!
Fantasia 🫶🏽😭
aaaaand I'm already bawling like a baby
Native Americans and African Americans need their stories told!!  THIS YEAR IS FOR US!  Scorse and Oprah are coming for those oscars!
Hollywood is dead!!!
I remake of the classic.  Looks promising.
Can't wait for the white fragility to show up and complain they made the characters black.
🙊
This looks like it's going to be amazing. I was just telling my sister about this reimagining yesterday. She didn't even know about it. Time to share the trailer!
Another black worship movie from the same creatures that inhabit the Americas.
I watched this with a smile, a tear and chills.
OMGGGGG IM GAGGING YESSSSSSSSSS POOH I KNOW IM GOING TO LOVE THIS CAUSE I FREAKING LOVE THIS WHOLE CAST 😆😆💯
God I hope they give Fantasia room to shine in this movie, she's got the potential to give an Oscar worthy performance here.  If this movie is as good as this trailer implies, I expect nothing short of perfection from her. She has the talent and the voice and  charisma to pull it off.
Can’t wait…..,Halle is winning…..
É impressão minha ou irão pegar leve no drama se comparado ao filme original? Tive essa impressão.. embora eu saiba que é a adaptação do musical de sucesso! From Brasil..🇧🇷👍🏻
This looks beautiful, I will be watching in a theater.
Looks like it will be immensely  moving and unforgettable
Now this is a good film that is actually worth watching because the content is original.
Wowwwwww!!!!!
Thank God it's not a movie on racism....
Seeing Fantasia about to have this major Hollywood moment brings tears to my eyes.
I’m over here freaking out.  I hope this movie gives my girl Fantasia all the praise and recognition she’s been so deserving of for so long.  Can’t wait.
YES!! LET'S GOOOOOO🥳
I'm sorry but they not topping Danny and Whoopi performance ain't no remake of the color purple going to over do the old one
THIS WAS SO DAMN GOOD OMG
If it aint whoopi and danny, i dont want it
you always on my mind, when you come on Tv I get shy, when I see you
I watched it
Shame on US they take a white mermaid character n black washing it n u guys can’t white wash this movie n get a lead white female ?
Halle! what a joy <3
Black people in America are making all of these great movies 🙂.
Omgggg this is like, so wholesome🥹🥹🥹
🙌🏾I’m excited
Beautiful i can't wait.
I look forward to this film. I have high hopes!
I hope this is a hit. The Original movie was no joke.
Fantasia Barrino!!!
I’m nearly in tears from the trailer, so I know somebody’s going to have to carry me out the theater!!! 😭
If this movie does not have the most amazing sound track ever....
💜✨💜
💜🤍
The original was good… why re make it. How about something new!
A real lack of diversity here.
Fantasia Barrino!!!!
BRO THEY JUST FUKKING UPP CLASSICS !!!
AND IM HEEEEEERE
This is EPIC. Can't wait also Mr. Steven Spielberg as produer 👊 well done
Kick this main girl n cast Angelina jolie or we boycott the trash
This movie better sweep the Oscars next year! 💜
Is there any new fresh ideas coming from Hollywood? They just remaking and rebooting, remaking and rebooting. Like they illergic to new ideas.
Hermoso
Totally looking forward to this.  The Broadway musical was amazing!  And they have such an amazing cast.
all my life i had to wait for this movie............NO MORE! ITS GOING TO BE SO GOOD! EXCITED!
When the firt of tráiler of wonka
Black washing the industry
Me being happy to see the musical and playing in it in high school and now seeing this version in theaters is one thing…..     But Spielberg, Oprah and Quincy producing it is another level.
Did I see John Batiste on piano?
NGL this looks excellent, but Kevin Samuels would've had a field day after seeing this trailer. RIP 🙏
WOW! It looks like Fantasia’s about to win her first Oscar.
Some classics are better left alone.....this movie will bomb
This looks beautiful. Thank god, they didn't use stupid filters that is used in almost every movie these days, and the result of that world looks either unrealistic or apocalyptic.
oooh great another remake that no one ask for it
I like it seen the original it’s a masterpiece this I’m impressed hopefully the movie is great !
YEEESSSS!!!!!!!!!! SO READYYY 💜💜💜💜💜💜
I am excited about this!!!
Star studded cast 🤩
More slavery movies !!
Halle bailey's chance to win an oscar
This looks soooo good!
You invest in the blood of your ancestors, and now you are doing more of the effect of whites in your ancestors, which is unfortunate
Why did that trailer give me chills and tears to my eyes!
Kevin samuels would be proud
Sorry, but no. I've read the book and seen the original film. both of which broke my heart.  i'll stand by those pieces. Please Please watch the original film..blows this out of the water
2:03 Is that Oscar winner Jon Batiste?
I’m already crying
I'm so excited!
This is a must see.
This movie looks very interesting!!! Can't wait to watch it this Christmas!!!!
I got chills
Wow, I cannot wait to see this musical adaptation of The Color Purple!
So proud of Fantasia 😘😘😘
Halle we love you !!! 🥰
I gotta wait till Christmas?
THIS. LOOKS. AMAZING. ❤
Halle is so beautiful ❤
whats with all the remakes? cant anyone in hollyweird come up with something new?
So happy for Halle
My only critique is that many of these shots keep their faces in the shadows or have camera angles where you can't see faces well. (Might just be my phone, though.) I have no problem with stylistic preferences. Especially if it enhances storytelling. But I'm hoping that this isn't going to be a running theme in the movie. You can certainly take advantage of nature light creatively even in low/indirectly locales.
No. Nah. Naw. Nope.
Glad that hailey is in Parkwood Entertainment. So many opportunities for her to bloom❤❤
when i see oprah i know it's the most oprah thing that oprah would do
I'm Nigerian......Big up Ghanaaaaa ❤❤❤
I’m in.
I hope it does well, but it initially does not appeal to to me the way the original did.  It feels like people playing dress-up, but we will see.
Halle is on a huge roll!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Ok hailey we see u ❤
Looks epic
Go HALLE!!!
First The Little Mermaid and now this?! Halle Bailey is on a roll!
Why did this make me so emotional! My goodness I can't wait to see this.
Instant Oscar!   (you know why)
I never seen the brodway version only saw the movie any diffrences?
This finna eat. I can’t wait
Hey Warner Bros. , Release 4 - 5 Parts Of Harry Potter's Next Story If You Want To Earn Limitless , We Potterheads Are Dying For Harry Potter Movies , Our Drug Is Empty From Many Years , We Are Repeatedly Watching Same Parts Again And Again .
Ok, but Spielbergs film is already one of the best films of all time, why?
Blitz the ambassador!!!!!  🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
Nice
This gave me absolute chills!! I can’t wait! FANTASIA ♥️🔥🙏🏽🙌🏾
Oh wow I’m gonna be a MESS in the theater 😢😢😢😢😂😂😂
Man oh man am I excited for this
I got a little teary just seeing/hearing Fantasia in this.
HALLEEEEEEEEE. apart of 2 iconic roles, little mermaid and now this. She is gonna be nominated for tons so happy for her 🎉❤❤❤❤
Amazing I’m so excited and the song omg fantasia goosebumps everytime she sings ⭐️💕
I get that Halle is the lady of the moment (& is heavily featured in the trailer) BUT Fantasia needs more love in this comment section for carrying the trailer with those stellar vocals!
I can’t wait to see this 😢color purple is one of my favorite movies 💜💜💜
Yes Halle I’m so proud of her
This looks like it could be great but theres something about the directing and cinematography that makes it look like a tv movie.
AA MASTERPIECE! Can't wait for this!
Some soulful singing from real singers. I'm there
This trailer got me crying
Nope.
Why trailer for this so early ? This movie doesn’t even come out till December ! It ain’t even summer yet 😅
😂 oh just read the caption. I wanted to know where all this singing and dancing coming from cause I couldnt remember the colour purple having all that in it
It's funny how American kill millions black people and now show they values hypocrite usa
Oooh i want to see this. I love this type of music
ok halle not you slaying
Okay. I thought I would be mad, but since it's the musical version, I can wholeheartedly accept it.
I'm crying!!!! Yes Tasia!!!!! Oh My God
Are Bhai Harry Potter Ke 4 - 5 Parts Aur Nikalo Agar Bumper Kamai Karni Hai Toh , Ham Potterheads Mare Jaa Rahe Hai , Hamara Drug Khatam Ho Gaya Hai .
Great another movie about how terrible black men are and how wonderful black women are. Just awesome. Keep it up.
Whew. The way Fantasias voice came in, the eyes welled up and my goosebumps raised. She should have won a TONY for her portrayal and she better not get robbed for her Oscar.
I can’t believe they turned my favorite color into a movie.
Is this one going to make me ugly cry too?
This cast is excellent! The trailer got me sold immediately! I’m seated day one!!
A pequena sereia!
I love H.E.R.! I would love to see her on Broadway!
👀👀👀🙌🏾
When i saw the original as a lil kid i remember it being dark, violent and very upsetting but this looks like a fun Disney like happy family time at the theatre..is it just a different movie that coincidently has the same name🤔Confused!!
If he shot her we would have been saved from little mermaid
Amazing! I will be watching <3333
Love this musical!! Can’t wait to see it (and put the soundtrack on loop)!!
this gave me chills
Why does everything need a remake ? Hollywood is so lame.
It looks okay, too many black people tho
This is not yo mama’s Color Purple
Wow, this is going to be good!! Fantasia reprising her role!!!
Yes Halle🥺 this looks great!
Great ensemble cast, that’s for sure. Wow. Finally looking forward to watching a remake. Imagine that.👏💁🏼‍♀️
can't wait!
Hailey Bailey is taking over the cinema!!!!
So excited to watch this! I love the musical!
Waooo 😍😍😍😍😍😍
pass
yassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Such an amazing book. Can't wait to see this new adaptation.
Wait. Did they kill Halle??😭
This looks good
Halle Bailey❤
I didn’t think I would like this movie from the look of it. I know it’s an adaptation of the broadway,  but I didn’t know how they would put this subject matter as a musical. And also the Spielberg classic is one of my favourite movies. But I gotta say, I like the look of this. Do need to see the whole movie for me to decide my opinion, but I’m kinda excited for this movie, and I can’t wait to see it. Also I’ve been saying for a while that I need a trailer, or something for this movie to get me excited, and I said that once again today… And what do ya know😂
Nothing beats the original
This is going to be good! dana t.
If Fantasia don't sing!!! I remember when she performed this song at the Tony Awards. One of my favorites of hers ever 🤗🙏🏾
Funniest thing is saying they are from kings and queens lol. we were KanGs and Shiet
I saw a screening of this last fall and it’s INCREDIBLE and I can’t wait to see it again
From beginning to end the trailer is such a n attention grabber I smell an Oscar💜
This looks incredible. I can’t wait! 🤎✨
From The Little Mermaid to a musical adaptation of The Colour Purple Halle Bailey is definitely on her way up to international stardom.
HALLE JORDAN YEAR😊 SHE HAS MY SUPPORT. TLM THEN THIS FOR CHRISTMAS 😊😊
The Man behind the slaughter 😈
Fantasia voice soaring😳🙌🙏
These remakes are now getting out of hand we need original content
Waiting until December?  Oh this is a story that should be released in the fall at latest.  The cast is amazing.
Are you telling me that Warner Brothers waited for releasing this trailer on the same week when Little Mermaid will come out? :D  Hollywood is merciless! Haha
Oh lord another black struggle movie 🤦🏽‍♂️ is this all we good for 🤦🏽‍♂️
No
This is everything!!
Why a remake?  What was so wrong with the last film that it needed an update?
2023 is Halle's big break.
long live musical theatre
DAMMM CANT WAIT TO SEE IT 😊😊😊
Why I just get a gust of heavy emotion when he said "I'm looking for a wife" it got real dark
Can't wait folks,c can't wait!;
I’ll give it a shot but it’s got big shoes to fill
I cried when I saw the film, I cried when I saw the musical, I will cry when I see this
I dont have a girlfriend , hoping to see this with her before this year ends.
Oscar bait? Yes , I care? No
So Happy For Fantasia!
The darkest hour of Cinema...
All her life halle had to fight 😂😂😂😂
Straight to the Oscars!!!! Manifesting best original song for Halle ❤️
Goosebumps all over me 😭😭😭
Umm no way  wreak the original   should never been named the same
HALLEEEEEE!!!!!
As soon as i heard Fantasia i was sold😭😭
I remember watching the og color purple. I fell asleep to it and my family painted my feet and fingernails purple lol
Why? Oh, it's another movie to trash black men that's why? All the Black men in the first one were monsters so yeah let's do it again. And we will get the Black women that hate Black men all over youtube to promote it.
mmmmmmmmm
Omfg this is going to be beautiful
Thank goodness we still have the 1985 classic!
Ron desantes favorite film
why though? the original was, is, and always will be classic, invent something original, enough already with a copy paste of the same movies and storylines
good musical film
I’m already crying! So excited
this is what I call a stellar cast, but I feel viola should be too. I am so looking forward to it.  I make a point of living the whole experience in theaters! 😭❤🇧🇷
I’m at work screaming this is about to be GOOD!! Let’s go FANTASIA
This is going to be a cinematic event! So much quality in the cast, footage and story. And it's coming out on Christmas. Theaters will be packed day 1
Certainly bold, looks trash, think I’ll stick with the original.
So Warner Bros will have 2 big releases at Christmas time with this and Aquaman 2
I WILL BE SEATED.
I had no idea that Colman Domingo was in this. That's extremely promising.
Wait wait wait, you’re telling me this is based on the broadway version? Since when there was a musical?
I never thought i would see Fantasia step back into this iconic role! I’m seeing this for this ensemble
But why??….
OH WE WILL BE SATTT
This is going to be legendary. Even I'm happy that Spielberg returns to produce this upcoming remake!
This is Halle’s year ❤
Omg this looks 🔥🔥🔥
Halle Bailey literally went from singing songs at home on YouTube with her sister, to starring in two of the biggest movies of the year. How incredible, what a gorgeous cast of black excellence. 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾👏🏾
They really using her for a old slave movie lol, the us propaganda is crazy. Give us our reparations then, or make movies about nat turner
Very intriguing
stop remaking classics plz
Yeah I’m kinda done with remakes and slavery movies but this doesn’t look terrible.
I see a couple of acting nominations. A lead and two supporting.
Yet another soulless cash grab. It didn't need a remake, the og movie was perfect. They are going to shove in more woke stuff in it. I understand at the time why it had that stuff but now it's going to beat us over the head with it
This looks great!
I AM AT THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE.
Fantasia ! 👏🏽👏🏽 we already crying !
I’ll watch this movie. I love that beautiful Duesenberg car at 1:16 ❤️
This is going to be incredible I got chills from watching this and tears came to my eyes this is gonna be an event
Yikes. What an embrassing movie.
Wheeewwww...... Yes I AM
Trailer was so touching, can’t imagine how the movie will be!🩶
OMG H.E.R. LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL!!!! I'm so ready for the vocals and for the beautiful music!!!!!
Wow! I can't wait!
FYI: this is NOT a remake of the original movie, it is an adaptation of the tony award winning broadway musical version. the musical is much more closer to the book than the original movie. the musical is vastly different from the original so there is nothing to worry about. this movie will be its own thing. this new version and the original are two completely different movies. both can co-exist without diminishing the other. i think this movie will be amazing and i have no doubt in my mind that it will be a huge success

If you need any more indication that their is an OBVIOUS DERTH of creativity, writing and direction in Hollywood… EXHIBIT P.  As for “African American” (whatever the F that means) films this is one of the most propagandized evil films ever created. Fitting for the times… Halle is off to a great career in cinema and that I can drink to.
The Little Mermaid has a beautiful voice
